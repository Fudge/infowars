[00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.440]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.620]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.384]  Today.
[00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:28.867]  Jorge Shimon of Cuba's Communist Central Committee delivered a message of anti-American invective.
[00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:30.708]  The theme of Cuba's foreign policy.
[00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:35.892]  His audience included 500 students from Scandinavia, France and Britain.
[00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:37.733]  Some flower children.
[00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:42.477]  Many, veterans of student riots in their homelands.
[00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:47.961]  They arrived on cut-rate charter flights and their living expenses were paid by the Cuban government.
[00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:50.443]  They spent their mornings working in the field.
[00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:52.525]  Their afternoons in political discussions.
[00:00:54.824 --> 00:01:02.249]  For American radicals, for American students, the most impressive feature of Cuba will be the building of the 21st man, the man of the 21st century.
[00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:20.511]  An entirely new consciousness to change all of the old attitudes and to change the morality from one based in the individual I and to put it into the collective we, which much more enforces individuality than detracts from it.
[00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:32.334]  The people in the United States, particularly the young people, I think, look to the Cuban Revolution with hope that this offers a solution that the United States doesn't offer.
[00:01:35.237 --> 00:01:38.739]  They are crying out for freedom in the streets of Havana.
[00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:43.022]  This, the greatest show of discontent with the socialist government since the 1990s.
[00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:49.186]  Like back then, the trigger for this protest is the desperate economic situation.
[00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:52.808]  Right now the country is suffering from food shortages.
[00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:56.444]  We're here because of the repression of the people.
[00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:58.204]  They are starving us to death.
[00:01:58.204 --> 00:01:59.244]  Havana is collapsing.
[00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.845]  We have no homes, nothing.
[00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.465]  Cubans are fed up.
[00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:13.768]  As the Miami Herald reported, in an unprecedented display of anger and frustration, thousands of people took to the streets in cities and towns across Cuba to call for the end of the
[00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:14.849]  We're good.
[00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:29.846]  I'm speaking to you today because
[00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.620]  I have seen people like this before.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.542]  I've seen movements like this before.
[00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.923]  I've seen ideas like this before.
[00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:10.224]  And I am here to tell you.
[00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:14.326]  We cannot let them take over our country.
[00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:17.367]  I heard the promises of Fidel Castro.
[00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:22.430]  And I can never forget all those who grew up around me.
[00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.110]  Who look like me.
[00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:30.569]  We are not going to surrender the sovereignty, or the independence of the people, or the freedom of this nation.
[00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:52.965]  Pivoting towards human independence, John Bowne reporting.
[00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.825]  I'm not gonna take it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:56.686]  That's communism fails again.
[00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.350]  This went live at Band.Video.
[00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.931]  Hope you share it.
[00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:32.314]  You notice the New York Times is talking about how Cuba started censoring what internet they have there and cutting it off to control people.
[00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:38.718]  And it's a non-satirical headline where they say, shouting freedom and other anti-government slogans.
[00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.359]  So, freedom is an evil thing to shout, isn't it?
[00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:47.362]  When you're these type of evil folks that are trying to bring what they've done in Cuba here, but on steroids.
[00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.584]  Some big developments have taken place.
[00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:51.405]  The biggest yet.
[00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:54.247]  When we come back, we're gonna lay it all out.
[00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:54.988]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:54.988 --> 00:05:01.814]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:05.798]  We know that the satanic principalities of this planet want us poisoned.
[00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:07.059]  They want to attack our bodies.
[00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:08.300]  They want to kill us.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.561]  Because we're made in the image of God.
[00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:15.272]  But God gave us the components of ourselves, of our bodies, to be strong.
[00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:17.233]  We've got everything we need.
[00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:23.177]  That's why the globalists hit us with the bad halogens of fluoride, fluorine, bromide, you name it, instead of iodine.
[00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:26.419]  Our food, our water, our plants, everything we eat is deficient in it.
[00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.780]  The average person is deficient.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.744]  It attacks your IQ, it attacks your stamina, and your libido and fertility particularly.
[00:05:32.744 --> 00:05:33.324]  Look into it.
[00:05:33.324 --> 00:05:36.867]  We have the purest iodine you're going to find anywhere on the planet in X2.
[00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:40.009]  And it's discounted right now with free shipping for 40% off in the dropper box.
[00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.131]  We have it for 60% off in the spray bottle.
[00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:44.812]  It's the exact same formula, but I want you to experience it for yourself.
[00:05:44.812 --> 00:05:47.534]  If you've been on the fence about iodine, this is the best.
[00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:48.075]  Try it today.
[00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:50.136]  It takes about 15 days to kick in.
[00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:54.920]  This is exclusively available at MFootwearStore.com right now, and it funds the MFootwear.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.561]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:16.515]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:17.916]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.809]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:50.731]  Welcome to the Verboten broadcast on this Tuesday, July 13th, worldwide transmission.
[00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:54.292]  We have no guest today other than Paul Joseph Watson in the fourth hour.
[00:06:54.292 --> 00:07:03.993]  I intend to cover the news and the developments in this war against humanity that we're chronicling and documenting and hopefully warning people and rallying people to resist.
[00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:07.254]  There have been a lot of just insane developments in everybody's face.
[00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:11.473]  that are going viral right now.
[00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.956]  And there is a giant awakening taking place.
[00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:20.040]  The big question is, is it happening fast enough?
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.122]  And a lot of this is just taking notice and caring.
[00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:37.192]  I got off here at two o'clock yesterday, and one of our great writers, Kit Daniels, walked over and he said, look at this article out of Politico that came out days ago, but it's gotten zero attention.
[00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:49.438]  And buried in it, it said, people are lying and saying Fauci wants to make vaccines mandatory, which he's announced, by the way, so they gaslight you.
[00:07:49.438 --> 00:08:02.801]  The DNC and other think tank groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center, you know, ADL, they want to censor people's text messages in live time and they want to read them and watch everything that Americans say.
[00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.212]  Beyond the NSA, beyond the FBI.
[00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:07.412]  Oh, but it's a private company.
[00:08:07.412 --> 00:08:08.973]  It's AT&T.
[00:08:08.973 --> 00:08:10.414]  It's Verizon.
[00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:12.815]  It's Apple.
[00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:14.536]  It's Droid.
[00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:20.700]  It's both the phone manufacturers and the telecommunications providers.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.742]  Just on a scale of 1 to 100 of surveillance and control, it's a 100.
[00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:27.883]  And we told you this was coming.
[00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.444]  We told you it was their holy grail.
[00:08:29.444 --> 00:08:30.605]  We have a clip we'll play in a moment.
[00:08:31.483 --> 00:08:38.766]  Of Oliver Darcy two years ago saying, we need to censor Alex Jones's text messages.
[00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:42.607]  We should take away his ability to text message people.
[00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:47.849]  My children, my grown children, my wife, my parents, I need that taken away.
[00:08:47.849 --> 00:08:56.072]  And everyone else needs to be surveilled.
[00:08:56.072 --> 00:08:56.552]  Let that
[00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.430]  Let that sink in.
[00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.452]  Live time surveillance of your email and of your text messages.
[00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:05.513]  I want to explain something.
[00:09:05.513 --> 00:09:11.816]  Going back five years ago, Gmail already blocks InfoWars.com, the URL.
[00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:13.557]  And that happens at libraries and other places.
[00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:17.119]  They put you in this false database as fake news or a fraud.
[00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:21.821]  And of course, they define anyone that resists them as that.
[00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:23.702]  But this really is the Holy Grail of control.
[00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:29.332]  So I'm glad that one of our writers read that article, thought it was important, it was just hidden in plain view.
[00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:51.768]  Saki talking to the press saying, yeah, we're getting ready to start the DNC is, I guess their new national police force they've announced, that's actually who, and the Pentagon, with trainees from the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, to read all of your text messages, have them scanned by AI, flagged, and then they're going to block your ability to say certain things
[00:09:52.577 --> 00:10:03.784]  And they're actually going to go into the autofill function and not let you type certain things even before it's been scanned when you try to send it.
[00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:06.045]  So this is the power of AI control.
[00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:12.889]  And I told you 10 years ago, their holy grail will be being able to ban certain voice prints.
[00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:18.493]  Well, now Facebook doesn't allow the uploading of any Trump clips, period.
[00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.915]  Unless it's by a handful of select controlled corporate media.
[00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:30.685]  This is every nightmare authoritarian system that you could ever imagine.
[00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:39.892]  This is every system that a dictator of the past could only dream of.
[00:10:39.892 --> 00:10:42.554]  And it's here now.
[00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:45.656]  And so, Kit Daniels and I wrote a story about it yesterday.
[00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:48.638]  I shot a special report on it.
[00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.100]  And it was posted at InfoWars.com.
[00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:58.259]  And then, of course, the great Tucker Carlson led with it last night.
[00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:00.300]  And now it's all over the news today.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.301]  And where is Congress?
[00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:04.762]  What are they doing about it?
[00:11:04.762 --> 00:11:06.502]  Here are some of the headlines breaking.
[00:11:06.502 --> 00:11:11.745]  DNC announces plan to surveil and censor all American private text messages, reports Politico.
[00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:16.427]  And, of course, notice they first say, oh, just to save lives with COVID.
[00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:16.747]  That's right.
[00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:17.107]  You can't.
[00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:23.173]  Talk about Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine when they suppress cures, because they're criminals.
[00:11:23.173 --> 00:11:26.275]  Big Tech's invested in Big Pharma.
[00:11:26.275 --> 00:11:29.637]  But really, then you read on, it's, oh, an election disinfo.
[00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:36.941]  You know, we can't let Trump have his speeches on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube, because, you know, you're not allowed to question the election.
[00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:38.362]  That's not something you're allowed to do.
[00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:41.124]  That's terrorism.
[00:11:41.124 --> 00:11:41.464]  Oh, and
[00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:48.914]  All other information we want to load in now, you can't email or text message.
[00:11:48.914 --> 00:11:54.516]  And then they're trying to go after all the small companies and say, you've got to get on board with our fact checkers.
[00:11:54.516 --> 00:11:58.898]  This is a giant criminal mafia takeover.
[00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:01.940]  That is a trillion times, literally, worse than the Stasi.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.322]  Because the Stasi would try to move in next to you and listen to you and get your neighbors to spy on you.
[00:12:06.322 --> 00:12:07.862]  And the FBI called for that last week.
[00:12:07.862 --> 00:12:11.424]  They said, spy on all your neighbors and see if somebody's criticizing the government.
[00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:16.919]  So see, we've gone off the edge of the cliff here.
[00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.639]  Breaking.
[00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:23.701]  DNC announces plan to surveil and censor all Americans' private text messages, reports, political.
[00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.822]  You see, that's why InfoWars is so important.
[00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:29.546]  We care about them hiding things in plain view.
[00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:30.967]  We made a big deal about it.
[00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:33.148]  We triggered the chain reaction and it got out there.
[00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:34.229]  That's not about taking credit.
[00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:36.451]  It's about you realizing what you can do as well.
[00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:46.117]  They want to just normalize vaccine passports and implantable microchips and drag queen story time and all of this and just have you not get upset about it and then it normalizes it.
[00:12:46.117 --> 00:12:48.899]  Well, we got upset about it and now it's the top story in the country.
[00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:51.378]  That's why this platform is so key.
[00:12:51.378 --> 00:12:54.940]  That's what scares me, is most of the time, it's us that breaks the big story.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.783]  That finds where they're rolling something out quietly and points it out.
[00:13:00.783 --> 00:13:07.906]  Democrat groups plan to fact-check private SMS messages on all texting platforms.
[00:13:07.906 --> 00:13:12.949]  And that, of course, ladies and gentlemen, is the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL already reading everything you're doing.
[00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:14.289]  They're already inside.
[00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:16.771]  They just want to announce it and normalize it.
[00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:17.571]  It's already been happening.
[00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:19.837]  Here's the New York Post.
[00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:25.979]  DNC-Biden allies want phone carriers to vet anti-vax messages.
[00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:27.039]  Oh, can't let the slaves.
[00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.920]  I mean, this is just like Cuba saying you can't protest.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.660]  It's the same thing.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.281]  It's just digital.
[00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:34.862]  What did the Canadian health minister, the head health minister, say two weeks ago?
[00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:37.644]  He said, we can't ever end the martial law.
[00:13:37.644 --> 00:13:39.964]  People will protest our government.
[00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:44.106]  No speech is allowed offline.
[00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:46.067]  You're like, well, that's total authoritarianism.
[00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:46.307]  Yeah.
[00:13:47.324 --> 00:13:49.686]  They're just doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:49.686 --> 00:13:50.987]  Here's another one out of the Gateway Pundit.
[00:13:50.987 --> 00:14:03.197]  Biden regime to monitor private communications calls and private text message carriers to dispel information about vaccines it sent over social media and text messages.
[00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:10.542]  Here's the original Politico article quoting a press conference where they said, oh, we've got to stop the lies.
[00:14:10.542 --> 00:14:13.084]  This is forced or this is intimidation.
[00:14:13.084 --> 00:14:16.267]  Oh, we've got to stop them and election news.
[00:14:17.205 --> 00:14:19.907]  You know, we're trying to save you.
[00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:23.810]  Meanwhile, Fauci ran the lab, created the virus, covered up all the real treatments.
[00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.533]  I mean, just openly should be in prison on death row right now.
[00:14:28.533 --> 00:14:31.035]  Here's Tucker Carlson, a great job last night covering it.
[00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:36.239]  Tucker Carlson, your private conversations will be controlled by the DNC.
[00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:37.820]  Here's the original article.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.083]  Democrats and big tech plan to censor private text conversations, vaccines, and elections.
[00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:47.881]  Breaking DNC announces plan to surveillance censor all Americans' private text messages.
[00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:50.242]  Reports Politico.
[00:14:50.242 --> 00:14:54.464]  Democrat group plans to fact check private SMS messages.
[00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:55.245]  Paul Watson.
[00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:57.065]  Again, that means surveil you.
[00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.486]  Scan everything you're doing.
[00:14:58.486 --> 00:14:59.366]  In your business.
[00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:00.107]  Reading your mail.
[00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.547]  Oh, and look who else is doing it.
[00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:02.748]  It's not a reason.
[00:15:02.748 --> 00:15:08.611]  USPS secret, semi-secret internet surveillance apparatus is also on the street.
[00:15:08.611 --> 00:15:10.452]  They're not worried about stolen goods.
[00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:12.853]  They're not worried about robberies of mail carriers.
[00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:13.053]  No!
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:25.362]  It says right here on page two that they are spying on protesters and anyone protesting the government.
[00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:31.964]  Domestically or internationally, it says right here, they're watching the evil patriots.
[00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.284]  Yes.
[00:15:33.284 --> 00:15:35.124]  Oh, it's better.
[00:15:35.124 --> 00:15:38.125]  The Capitol Police, that $2 billion, they're spreading all over the country.
[00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:41.478]  As the secret police, they say no FOIA request allowed.
[00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:46.400]  The secret police to use army surveillance gear to monitor Americans.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.581]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.362]  So it's the total takeover for martial law.
[00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:54.823]  We're gonna play the clips when we come back and then get into the even bigger news.
[00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:56.464]  Straight ahead, shock report.
[00:15:56.464 --> 00:16:01.385]  Wait till you hear it.
[00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:02.666]  Your voice counts.
[00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:08.522]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[00:16:08.522 --> 00:16:11.104]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.605]  They know you're angry.
[00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:18.009]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.
[00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:27.215]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports,

[00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:04.419]  What are champions made of?
[00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:05.541]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:13.653]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the Infowars store hotline.
[00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:15.573]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the Infowars store hotline.
[00:17:15.573 --> 00:17:16.914]  AAA-253-3139 is the Infowars store hotline.
[00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:18.194]  AAA-253-3139 is the Infowars store hotline.
[00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:19.274]  AAA-253-3139 is the Infowars store hotline.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.784]  InfoWarsTore.com is simply the best.
[00:17:41.784 --> 00:17:44.828]  InfoWarsTore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:17:44.828 --> 00:17:45.949]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsTore hotline.
[00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:46.069]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:17:59.105 --> 00:18:01.586]  I never had a marketing plan for InfoWars.
[00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:05.869]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to fund our operation.
[00:18:05.869 --> 00:18:10.533]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:12.114]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:13.114]  It's very, very simple.
[00:18:13.114 --> 00:18:14.115]  It's instinctive.
[00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:14.696]  It's spiritual.
[00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:15.196]  It's what I do.
[00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:18.879]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[00:18:18.879 --> 00:18:26.365]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:27.065]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.807]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:33.290]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.711]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:37.093]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[00:18:37.093 --> 00:18:38.074]  I got to sell them at discount.
[00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:45.176]  And so, it's discounted 40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:46.796]  It won't be available for months.
[00:18:46.796 --> 00:18:47.776]  So get it.
[00:18:47.776 --> 00:18:54.378]  X2 is selling out at m4wrestore.com for 40 and 60% off with double paid reappointment and free shipping.
[00:18:54.378 --> 00:18:55.338]  Because why?
[00:18:55.338 --> 00:18:56.378]  That's when you buy it.
[00:18:56.378 --> 00:18:57.878]  We need your funds or we'll be off air.
[00:18:57.878 --> 00:19:02.719]  It's an amazing product.
[00:19:02.719 --> 00:19:05.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:15.698 --> 00:19:36.724]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:38.465]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:38.465 --> 00:19:42.026]  I've told you for more than a decade that the Holy Grail of control
[00:19:43.354 --> 00:19:58.985]  Is live time corporate spying on you and your family with these home assistants, with the Amazon ring systems and others, having that all wired in to corporations and the government to be able to totally control and run your life.
[00:19:58.985 --> 00:20:01.867]  And the fact that you have nothing to hide is not the issue.
[00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:06.830]  This is a predatory system that is saying you're obsolete, that you're not essential.
[00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:18.810]  That is going to use this information against you and do things like not let you tell people about ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, which the majority of the public got, who were sick so they didn't die.
[00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.391]  So they weren't able to murder you.
[00:20:20.391 --> 00:20:31.933]  Fauci, a eugenicist who helped carry out depopulation around the world, works directly with Bill Gates, is hopping pissed that you're talking via text message and email and word of mouth.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.643]  And so he said, I'm outraged that they're on CPAC saying don't trust the vaccine.
[00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:40.225]  Well, we've got articles out today, we'll be covering next segment.
[00:20:40.225 --> 00:20:41.586]  Shock report!
[00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:45.589]  There were more COVID-19 vaccine deaths last week in the U.S.
[00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:48.271]  than COVID-19 deaths.
[00:20:48.271 --> 00:20:49.712]  That's an official number.
[00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:53.614]  FDA adds Guillain-Barré syndrome warning to Johnson & Johnson.
[00:20:53.614 --> 00:20:55.516]  We told you in the studies it already did that.
[00:20:55.516 --> 00:20:57.577]  We told you that a year and a half ago.
[00:20:57.577 --> 00:21:02.801]  Dad in hospital paralyzed by first COVID vaccine continues receiving texts about getting his second jab.
[00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:13.238]  All over the world they're announcing a World ID and forced inoculation to be able to live your life.
[00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.759]  CNN's announcing they want that here.
[00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:23.345]  You have to understand, they're going to do this by increment one way or the other until they are arrested.
[00:21:23.345 --> 00:21:25.546]  They're being elected through fraud.
[00:21:25.546 --> 00:21:26.927]  Merkel has been installed.
[00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:28.648]  Macron has been installed.
[00:21:28.648 --> 00:21:30.950]  Johnson got elected posing as a patriot.
[00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.871]  He's as bad as they come in the UK.
[00:21:35.402 --> 00:21:40.944]  And I'm going to cover that in the last segment of this hour.
[00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:44.526]  The fact that we are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:21:44.526 --> 00:21:49.648]  Things are not going to get better until these people are arrested.
[00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:51.689]  This is not a normal political system we're fighting.
[00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:59.012]  This is a scientific, criminal takeover that is having press conferences with Jen Psaki
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:15.891]  Saying the DNC is in talks with all text message providers to surveil what you do in live time and censor what you can say in your own damn private messages.
[00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:18.153]  Because they know and they complain.
[00:22:18.153 --> 00:22:20.234]  I've seen it on CNN.
[00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:29.061]  Oh, Bolsonaro got arrested using, excuse me, Bolsonaro got elected using WhatsApp.
[00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:36.264]  Even though he was censored off everything in Brazil, he was able to use online text messages.
[00:22:36.264 --> 00:22:37.465]  We can't let him do that.
[00:22:37.465 --> 00:22:43.088]  Or, oh, Alex Jones is using text messages.
[00:22:43.088 --> 00:22:44.990]  People are promoting him via text message.
[00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:56.518]  We're reaching out to Facebook, Oliver Darcy said on CNN two years ago, to see if he is using text messages to talk to people privately.
[00:22:58.012 --> 00:23:01.174]  And they reached out and found out I wasn't using it.
[00:23:01.174 --> 00:23:04.336]  Because I was already banned off of it.
[00:23:04.336 --> 00:23:07.839]  CNN talking about my private text messages.
[00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:11.241]  And under this operation they've already got in place.
[00:23:11.241 --> 00:23:15.404]  It's come out that Twitter and Facebook and all of them are reading your private messages.
[00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:17.305]  And Apple is reading your private messages.
[00:23:17.305 --> 00:23:19.426]  And the droid companies are reading your private messages.
[00:23:19.426 --> 00:23:23.709]  And your content providers are reading all of it.
[00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:26.551]  The different apps are spying on you.
[00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:27.732]  All of it is spying on you.
[00:23:28.928 --> 00:23:36.332]  And the major telecom providers, and the cable companies, and Netflix, and TiVo, all of them!
[00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:38.713]  I remember when they first came out with DVRs.
[00:23:40.616 --> 00:23:46.441]  18, 19 years ago, I said, these things are watching what you watch and recording a record of what you watch.
[00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:54.306]  And later, they did things like erase the two episodes of Jesse Ventura that I was on, American Conspiracy, where I warned of all this.
[00:23:54.306 --> 00:24:00.791]  And they admitted that they went in, Time Warner did, and erased the episodes off of people's DVRs without asking them.
[00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:02.252]  And it was in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:24:02.252 --> 00:24:06.475]  It was a big scandal that, wow, they don't want you to see this show.
[00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:08.377]  They erased it off the damn DVR.
[00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:12.679]  It's a technocracy!
[00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:16.145]  A total control system!
[00:24:16.145 --> 00:24:22.236]  And I'm going to explain, coming back, after we play the Cedric Carlson clip, what that means.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.661]  It's like dominoes.
[00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:25.462]  You're like, oh, I don't care.
[00:24:25.462 --> 00:24:26.443]  I've done nothing wrong.
[00:24:26.443 --> 00:24:28.265]  Let them spy on me.
[00:24:28.265 --> 00:24:36.412]  That's taking you to a place of depopulation, of being locked down, of being sterilized, of being injected, of being given cancer.
[00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:47.522]  They're locking everybody down and putting Cuban level censorship and control, Russian KGB level control, East German control, because they've got horrible things planned.
[00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:57.095]  In the official database, more deaths from vaccines last week from the supposed COVID shot.
[00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:57.895]  We're going to cover that.
[00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:58.836]  Do you understand?
[00:24:58.836 --> 00:25:00.637]  They're making their move.
[00:25:00.637 --> 00:25:04.839]  And I told you they'd claim, oh, we're taking restrictions off.
[00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:08.301]  But they just put them right back on with more controls than before.
[00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:12.803]  And now that's being done exactly as I said, because it's an enemy plan.
[00:25:13.968 --> 00:25:24.932]  And only by admitting that and organizing legislatures and governors and society and shunning corporations and businesses that are the first to try to bully us in to these vaccine passports, can we stop them?
[00:25:24.932 --> 00:25:34.976]  Because once they get their world ID, that thing's going to tell you under a carbon rationing tax where you can go, what you can do, what you can eat, who you can live with, everything!
[00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:37.957]  They admit that's the plan!
[00:25:37.957 --> 00:25:41.839]  This global internet ID is for social credit control.
[00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:44.551]  It is for surveillance.
[00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:47.394]  And it's all being shoehorned in under the name of COVID.
[00:25:47.394 --> 00:25:53.961]  Oh, we're going to read your text messages and censor them for COVID and elections and other news.
[00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:56.103]  Just bombshell over the top.
[00:25:56.103 --> 00:25:58.806]  Unprecedented.
[00:25:58.806 --> 00:25:59.967]  Hitler on steroids.
[00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:16.177]  And here they are, almost two years ago, talking about what it's really all about, silencing their number one enemy, who's aware of their criminal activity, because if everybody ever figures out that what I'm telling you is their real plan, not my opinion, it's game over!
[00:26:16.177 --> 00:26:19.418]  They're taking you to a hellish dystopia!
[00:26:19.418 --> 00:26:20.719]  Here's CNN from two years ago.
[00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:28.635]  They'll be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[00:26:28.635 --> 00:26:39.906]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, and a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts.
[00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:43.067]  Yeah, you can't let people have private text message accounts.
[00:26:43.067 --> 00:26:43.787]  I mean, what's next?
[00:26:43.787 --> 00:26:46.249]  Like, are they allowed to even have a house or children?
[00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:47.009]  Maybe own a gun?
[00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:49.811]  I mean, next they're going to want to be able to rally or demonstrate.
[00:26:49.811 --> 00:26:50.752]  You can't do that.
[00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:54.234]  I mean, that'll overturn the regime.
[00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:56.556]  Just like Cuba.
[00:26:56.556 --> 00:26:57.557]  And there's a whole other one.
[00:26:57.557 --> 00:26:59.538]  We can't find the clip with him with Brian Stelter.
[00:27:00.788 --> 00:27:04.870]  But they talk about, yeah, Bolsonaro got elected with text messages.
[00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.691]  Yeah, Alex Jones is getting around us.
[00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:10.353]  His fans are spreading the words he's still on air via text message.
[00:27:10.353 --> 00:27:12.474]  We've just got to get in those text messages.
[00:27:12.474 --> 00:27:17.137]  We just, you know, you know, you're right, Brian Stelter says, Oliver.
[00:27:17.137 --> 00:27:19.938]  We've just got to get in that private email and those text messages.
[00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:21.039]  Yeah, we're the good guys.
[00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:23.560]  We can't let those dirty Americans talk.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.261]  Yeah, we got to shut them up right now.
[00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:27.542]  Don't worry, we will, though.
[00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:29.350]  They're the bad guys.
[00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.870]  And then I saw him in the hallway in D.C.
[00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.032]  and said, how dare you try to take my speech?
[00:27:34.032 --> 00:27:35.332]  And Twitter said, that's it.
[00:27:35.332 --> 00:27:37.013]  You're finally completely banned.
[00:27:37.013 --> 00:27:38.634]  You were mean to Oliver Darcy.
[00:27:38.634 --> 00:27:43.956]  You're not even allowed to criticize him, a good little censor that wants to read your text messages and censor you.
[00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:51.179]  He's a hero like Ceausescu or Hitler or Stalin or Mao or O'Brien in 1984.
[00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:53.200]  Alex Jones is a bad man.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.161]  He doesn't want you to read everybody's text messages.
[00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:56.562]  He wants you to have privacy.
[00:27:56.562 --> 00:27:57.402]  A bad man.
[00:27:58.306 --> 00:28:02.069]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:28:02.069 --> 00:28:05.773]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:28:05.773 --> 00:28:08.375]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:13.424]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:28:13.424 --> 00:28:19.189]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[00:28:19.189 --> 00:28:30.781]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:33.522]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:28:33.522 --> 00:28:37.643]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:28:37.643 --> 00:28:48.246]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:57.789]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:58.429]  Thank you so much.
[00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:05.945]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers in the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:09.530]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.393]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[00:29:11.393 --> 00:29:13.436]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[00:29:13.436 --> 00:29:15.059]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:16.499]  But what's in that food?
[00:29:16.499 --> 00:29:17.099]  Iodine.
[00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:21.700]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.641]  And the food itself is lacking.
[00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:27.062]  That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine.
[00:29:27.062 --> 00:29:31.523]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposed to need to have because they want control.
[00:29:31.523 --> 00:29:33.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information's powerful.
[00:29:33.643 --> 00:29:35.143]  Our products are just as powerful.

[00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:52.755]  They don't want you to experience this.

[00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:07.580]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:16.342]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[00:30:16.342 --> 00:30:22.763]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:23.263 --> 00:30:25.906]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:31.933]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones at 50% off $14.95.
[00:30:31.933 --> 00:30:35.237]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[00:30:35.237 --> 00:30:37.479]  We've got a private label with InfoWars on them.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:48.604]  For $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:51.245]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[00:30:51.245 --> 00:30:56.488]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[00:30:56.488 --> 00:31:01.130]  They're 50% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.811]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:29.941 --> 00:31:31.022]  Info Wars!
[00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:32.983]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:31:32.983 --> 00:31:35.024]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:31:35.024 --> 00:31:39.286]  I intend to open the phones up in the second and third hour today.
[00:31:39.286 --> 00:31:53.173]  And I intend, if not in the next segment, start of the next hour, to explain exactly how they're going to close the net, the noose around our necks, and slowly destroy us in the next few years.
[00:31:53.173 --> 00:31:57.135]  And just what the world's going to look like then if we don't turn this around.
[00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:58.736]  And I would suggest you record this
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:06.282]  Because if we're unable to stop them very soon, the next six months to a year, we're not going to be on the air anymore.
[00:32:06.282 --> 00:32:12.024]  And that's going to be a major canary in the coal mine, really, for the end of this phase.
[00:32:12.024 --> 00:32:16.705]  And then it's going to be a much, much darker, long, horrible future for humanity.
[00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:18.886]  I've really tried to warn everybody as best I could.
[00:32:18.886 --> 00:32:20.286]  I've done the research.
[00:32:20.286 --> 00:32:21.426]  I've had the experts on.
[00:32:21.426 --> 00:32:22.927]  I've studied the globalists.
[00:32:22.927 --> 00:32:26.848]  And this is a forced, dystopic takeover.
[00:32:27.907 --> 00:32:31.708]  That is designed to bring us into a depopulation position.
[00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:34.849]  It is a post-industrial world.
[00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:38.410]  What do you think a post-industrial world is going to look like?
[00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:44.212]  It's going to look like Mad Max meets THX 1138.
[00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:55.696]  Poor starving people that are massively decimated with no medicine or health care living as slaves in the ruins of cities in some rural areas with high-tech
[00:32:56.542 --> 00:33:00.546]  Globalist command bases with super technology above the law.
[00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:10.074]  That is their stated goal is to collapse the nation-state under global government and then have the rise of nation-states.
[00:33:10.074 --> 00:33:11.355]  Excuse me, that's a Freudian slip.
[00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:12.496]  We need nation-states.
[00:33:12.496 --> 00:33:22.945]  The rise of city-states controlled by the globalists like the Vatican, like Israel, like the Club of Rome is pushed for with the City of London within London.
[00:33:22.945 --> 00:33:24.166]  So there is the headline.
[00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:37.368]  The globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now or billions will die.
[00:33:37.368 --> 00:33:44.913]  Now you understand tens of millions have already starved to death on top of who would already starve to death each year.
[00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:50.776]  You understand the third world's completely collapsing and the UN is organizing it into giant migrant flows to invade and take us over.
[00:33:51.658 --> 00:34:00.766]  You understand crime has literally doubled and tripled and quadrupled all over the world.
[00:34:00.766 --> 00:34:02.988]  This isn't a zombie apocalypse movie.
[00:34:02.988 --> 00:34:14.117]  This is the controlled demolition of the planet and the New World Order is on the news saying it's all being done because of climate change or it's all being done because of racism or it's all being done because of that.
[00:34:14.117 --> 00:34:19.982]  No, it's being done by them purposely carrying out a global lockdown that they knew
[00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:35.428]  We'll take half the world population into starvation within one year of a lockdown and they've only increased it now in Africa and India and other areas.
[00:34:35.428 --> 00:34:46.432]  It is a time bomb that is a chain reaction of time bombs and we've already seen the first few bombs go off and now, like dominoes falling, it's only going to get more intense.
[00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:47.092]  So this morning,
[00:34:49.002 --> 00:35:00.788]  I've got my parents coming over for dinner tonight, and they're smart, but I'm just going to tell them, like, all bets are off, and we need to have a discussion about how we protect ourselves at this point.
[00:35:00.788 --> 00:35:10.012]  Because we tried to stop the New World Order takeover, we tried to stop Operation Lockstep, we tried to stop the initiation of this, they did it anyways.
[00:35:10.012 --> 00:35:12.714]  And I'll explain coming up, start of the next hour, why.
[00:35:13.815 --> 00:35:18.857]  Just to give you a little prelude, they had to because we exposed their long-term strategic plan.
[00:35:18.857 --> 00:35:21.098]  They were always going to do what they're doing now.
[00:35:21.098 --> 00:35:30.842]  They were planning to launch it around 2030 instead of now, but because nationalists were taking back all these countries around the world, they went ahead and accelerated their program.
[00:35:30.842 --> 00:35:31.843]  And so they're all in.
[00:35:31.843 --> 00:35:34.504]  They're committed, and they don't care now.
[00:35:34.504 --> 00:35:35.524]  That's what you've got to understand.
[00:35:35.524 --> 00:35:37.065]  They're not going to stop.
[00:35:37.065 --> 00:35:39.006]  And I want to just go ahead and get this out now.
[00:35:43.604 --> 00:35:47.789]  They always plan to release bioweapons if we try to overthrow them.
[00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:57.081]  They always plan to use race-specific weapons if any type of populist or Christian group or nationalist group ever got control of enough countries to challenge their world government plan.
[00:35:58.945 --> 00:36:05.289]  And they were always planning the depopulation regardless later once they thought they had us under their thumb and could do it in an orderly fashion.
[00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:09.511]  But they will do it in a disorderly fashion in an attempt to maintain control.
[00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:11.513]  So they're going to kill you one way or the other.
[00:36:11.513 --> 00:36:13.954]  They're going to murder you and your family one way or another.
[00:36:13.954 --> 00:36:15.355]  It's their stated plan.
[00:36:15.355 --> 00:36:22.039]  The question is are you going to let them do it on their timetable in 10 years and succeed or are you going to make them do it next year or maybe next month?
[00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:33.616]  Because people are going to know when, you know, when your wife and your kids are flopping around dying with a real bioweapon, or they hit you with drones with chemical weapons, if you survive, just remember, you can live to fight and defeat these people.
[00:36:33.616 --> 00:36:35.837]  Because later, you're going to know you're back against the wall.
[00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:37.858]  We're going to beat them later.
[00:36:37.858 --> 00:36:39.679]  We're going to dig them out of their armored redoubts.
[00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:41.600]  We're going to hunt them down, okay?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.702]  But I'm just telling you, I'm probably obviously not going to be there.
[00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.842]  That's okay.
[00:36:45.842 --> 00:36:48.524]  I'm expending my full force against them now.
[00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:50.104]  And I'm not going to pull punches.
[00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:51.185]  I'm not going to mince words here.
[00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.374]  Because you know what's going to happen.
[00:36:53.374 --> 00:36:55.435]  I'm not stupid and you're not either.
[00:36:55.435 --> 00:37:03.618]  You know as all this happens that I'm going to go from credible to ultra-credible and they're not going to allow me to be walking around very soon.
[00:37:03.618 --> 00:37:06.218]  But that's okay.
[00:37:06.218 --> 00:37:13.461]  Because I've lived a life of resistance and I can stand before God and say, I want to know you.
[00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.112]  I want to be a good spirit.
[00:37:17.112 --> 00:37:18.493]  And I've tried to be good.
[00:37:18.493 --> 00:37:20.215]  Please let me be with you.
[00:37:20.215 --> 00:37:21.557]  And that's all I care about.
[00:37:21.557 --> 00:37:31.447]  I'm not worried about these globalists and their private jets and their money and their mistresses and their power and, oh, they're going to live forever and, oh, they're going to merge with machines and, oh, they're going to be gods and all this.
[00:37:33.155 --> 00:37:41.081]  And I had hoped that they were just beta testing and that this was just to get control and that they didn't really have the will to go all the way through with it.
[00:37:41.081 --> 00:37:45.444]  They are going all the way through with mass depopulation.
[00:37:45.444 --> 00:37:58.132]  That Bill Gates and Ted Turner and David Rockefeller and Oprah Winfrey have all signed on to and Prince Charles and Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth and every damn stinking one of them have signed on to a plan to depopulate the world 90%.
[00:37:59.313 --> 00:38:00.913]  And they're going to pose as the U.N.
[00:38:00.913 --> 00:38:12.976]  medical saviors protecting you from the bioweapons and the chemical weapons and the radiological weapons and the electromagnetic weapons that they're going to be killing us all with and their weather weapons to starve us to death and all the rest of it.
[00:38:12.976 --> 00:38:17.377]  I guess I'm getting to it now, but I'm going to get to it next hour as well.
[00:38:17.377 --> 00:38:22.318]  So, I mean, imagine if I told you ten years ago, which I did, that, have the archivists look it up.
[00:38:22.318 --> 00:38:24.458]  I mean, don't go too crazy, but just get ten clips.
[00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:36.577]  And I know for more than 10 years I've told you, you'll know they're about to take over when they start saying we're going to read your text messages in live time with AI and control what you can say and what you do.
[00:38:36.577 --> 00:38:45.322]  And if you send text messages we don't like, we'll take away your texting capability with a social credit score.
[00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.924]  And I told you all that and now it's here.
[00:38:47.924 --> 00:38:52.907]  So, on a scale of 1 to 100 of tyranny, what they've got in place is a 100.
[00:38:54.637 --> 00:38:59.519]  In the realm of surveillance and the potential for control.
[00:38:59.519 --> 00:39:04.701]  Now all they've got to do is implement the next phase, which is the rounding up and the killing and the starving us to death.
[00:39:04.701 --> 00:39:06.302]  And that's why we've all been told we're not essential.
[00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:07.963]  I mean, this is very draconian.
[00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:14.096]  And the public is so in a daze and so drunk on entertainment, they're not going to know what hit them.
[00:39:14.096 --> 00:39:19.161]  But I personally am going to try to persevere as long as God wants to keep us on air.
[00:39:19.161 --> 00:39:21.243]  And that's up to you how long you want to keep us on air.
[00:39:21.243 --> 00:39:23.806]  But, I mean, we could be on air a month, six months, a year.
[00:39:23.806 --> 00:39:24.667]  People could wake up.
[00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:25.588]  Governors could wake up.
[00:39:25.588 --> 00:39:26.589]  Legislators could wake up.
[00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:27.770]  People could organize.
[00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.213]  We could see this monstrosity for what it is.
[00:39:30.213 --> 00:39:31.214]  Fauci could be arrested.
[00:39:31.214 --> 00:39:32.195]  Bill Gates could be arrested.
[00:39:32.715 --> 00:39:33.895]  They ran the Wuhan lab.
[00:39:33.895 --> 00:39:35.716]  They suppressed all these treatments.
[00:39:35.716 --> 00:39:40.157]  They worked with big tech to suppress treatments so they would make more money off their vaccines.
[00:39:40.157 --> 00:39:43.658]  They sent sick people into nursing homes to get a higher death rate.
[00:39:43.658 --> 00:39:48.480]  They denied people treatment that had pneumonia and flu so they get a higher death rate.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.340]  And it was all battle planned out.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:57.482]  But if we're going to let them sit there and kill us, if we're going to let them get away with all this murder, they're going to go ahead with the plan.
[00:39:57.482 --> 00:39:59.143]  Let's put that headline back up there.
[00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:07.408]  The globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now, or billions will die.
[00:40:07.408 --> 00:40:08.369]  Period.
[00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:15.254]  Now, see, we're at the point where I told you everything that's happened up until now, years before, exactly as it would happen, so I want to study them.
[00:40:15.254 --> 00:40:20.538]  We're not going to be here next time, you understand, to tell you once this goes through.
[00:40:20.538 --> 00:40:22.960]  Your wife, your children, you are dead.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.641]  You're dead.
[00:40:23.641 --> 00:40:24.401]  You understand?
[00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:25.062]  They're going to kill you.
[00:40:26.494 --> 00:40:28.275]  And I can explain how they've already done it.
[00:40:28.275 --> 00:40:31.478]  Half the countrymen that have taken this shot aren't going to be here in a couple years.
[00:40:31.478 --> 00:40:34.901]  Which is why, again, they're not going to let us organize against that.
[00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:39.064]  Before they figure out they're all dead, they're going to hit us with something much bigger.
[00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:42.212]  So I'm just telling you, it's all over.
[00:40:42.212 --> 00:40:50.095]  Almost every FBI agent, almost every school teacher, almost every auto mechanic, farmer listening to me, you're all dead.
[00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:51.795]  They're coming to kill you.
[00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:52.736]  Period.
[00:40:52.736 --> 00:40:54.656]  They've already killed half the country.
[00:40:54.656 --> 00:40:55.797]  We have been slaughtered.
[00:40:55.797 --> 00:40:56.717]  We have been murdered.
[00:40:57.257 --> 00:41:00.659]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:03.440]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.322]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[00:41:06.322 --> 00:41:07.762]  You must have it to live.
[00:41:07.762 --> 00:41:11.944]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[00:41:11.944 --> 00:41:18.347]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[00:41:18.347 --> 00:41:19.368]  60% off on the spray top.
[00:41:20.068 --> 00:41:24.932]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[00:41:24.932 --> 00:41:27.274]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[00:41:27.274 --> 00:41:27.974]  They're amazing.
[00:41:27.974 --> 00:41:30.416]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:35.860]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.202]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[00:41:38.322 --> 00:41:41.464]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:12.412]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:42:12.412 --> 00:42:14.753]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:42:14.753 --> 00:42:23.576]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:34.759]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:42:34.759 --> 00:42:34.979]  Yes.
[00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:40.344]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:42:40.344 --> 00:42:47.130]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:48.311]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:42:48.311 --> 00:42:50.193]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:53.015]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:42:53.015 --> 00:42:53.756]  Super!
[00:42:53.756 --> 00:42:56.158]  Mail by Paladin at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:58.602 --> 00:43:02.383]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[00:43:02.383 --> 00:43:04.863]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[00:43:04.863 --> 00:43:09.724]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[00:43:09.724 --> 00:43:11.225]  This is an incredible formula.
[00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:12.645]  Everybody should be taking it.
[00:43:12.645 --> 00:43:15.466]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:16.766]  It's an amazing product.
[00:43:16.766 --> 00:43:17.926]  It's our newest product.
[00:43:17.926 --> 00:43:20.147]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[00:43:20.147 --> 00:43:21.227]  MFoneWorksTour.com.
[00:43:21.227 --> 00:43:22.747]  Then we have both types of X2.
[00:43:22.747 --> 00:43:26.828]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap.
[00:43:27.088 --> 00:43:29.809]  For 60 and 40% off, depending on which one.
[00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:31.970]  They're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:39.694]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:39.694 --> 00:43:41.956]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:41.956 --> 00:43:50.320]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.760]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.723]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.583]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[00:44:02.583 --> 00:44:07.146]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:44:07.146 --> 00:44:16.353]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:20.816]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:44:20.816 --> 00:44:21.817]  And they are collapsing
[00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:22.057]  I think so.
[00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:54.742]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:44:54.742 --> 00:45:01.265]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:15.307 --> 00:45:17.550]  Ah, the good old days.
[00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.552]  Out in La Grange.
[00:45:19.552 --> 00:45:21.954]  The ranch, the chicken ranch.
[00:45:21.954 --> 00:45:22.815]  The whorehouse.
[00:45:22.815 --> 00:45:24.096]  ZZ Top.
[00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:26.239]  They got some nice girls.
[00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:32.682]  You know what I'm talking about.
[00:45:32.682 --> 00:45:35.865]  If you want to go... Right down the road from Austin.
[00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:39.688]  To that home I was on the range.
[00:45:39.688 --> 00:45:41.029]  They got a lot of nice girls.
[00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:43.090]  None of them kidnapped, though.
[00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:44.852]  There were 15.
[00:45:44.852 --> 00:45:49.776]  Like... Mr. Branson and Lolita Express.
[00:45:49.776 --> 00:45:52.098]  And all of the Clintons.
[00:45:52.098 --> 00:45:53.519]  Well, you're a spy.
[00:46:01.138 --> 00:46:03.639]  All right, let's get serious.
[00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:24.686]  You understand, this is a depopulation plan, and they have it all war-gamed out, each phase, to clamp down, take more liberties, then open it up a little bit, convince you that going along with the World ID and the forced inoculation and the implantable microchip that they're now announcing, that you'll be free once you do that, and then, oh, sorry, you're not free, there's more you've got to do.
[00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:31.164]  And then once they've got you trained to go into real martial law, then they're going to start the real depopulation.
[00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:36.487]  But they need to make sure you behave yourselves while they're killing you.
[00:46:36.487 --> 00:46:37.208]  This is all beta.
[00:46:37.208 --> 00:46:39.909]  And I'm going to explain again.
[00:46:39.909 --> 00:46:48.575]  They didn't spend trillions of dollars and set up world government for the express mission of depopulation to not do it.
[00:46:48.575 --> 00:46:49.996]  And I know, it's horrible.
[00:46:49.996 --> 00:46:53.157]  Listen, I'm having trouble coming to grips with this.
[00:46:53.157 --> 00:46:54.798]  I can't believe they're actually going ahead with it either.
[00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:58.755]  My wife and family want to go to movies.
[00:46:58.755 --> 00:46:59.815]  They want to go out on the boat.
[00:46:59.815 --> 00:47:01.116]  They want to have fun.
[00:47:01.116 --> 00:47:03.457]  I can't even do it anymore.
[00:47:03.457 --> 00:47:05.258]  Because I know the timetable.
[00:47:05.258 --> 00:47:12.022]  It's like we've all been given death sentences of a month, six months, a year, two years.
[00:47:12.022 --> 00:47:20.206]  I've got hundreds of articles here of total tyranny, secret arrest, torture, death, no free speech, collapsing countries.
[00:47:20.206 --> 00:47:24.669]  All these presidents, now it's four of them that didn't allow forced inoculation.
[00:47:24.669 --> 00:47:25.389]  They've all been killed.
[00:47:29.122 --> 00:47:37.845]  I just watched Dick Durbin in the coffee room, Rob is grabbing the clip, have a Freudian slip and say that the vaccine's already killed millions.
[00:47:37.845 --> 00:47:39.406]  We're going to get to that clip in a moment.
[00:47:39.406 --> 00:47:44.028]  Let me get to the Tucker Carlson thing and then I'm going to settle down and actually lay out.
[00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:51.910]  I've said I'm going to lay out their master plan and I've done it to a certain extent, but I really want to go through the intricacies of this so that you understand that I'm not blowing smoke at you.
[00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:58.733]  And I know you know that, but I mean, I don't want to say these things and it hurts me really bad to say these things.
[00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:02.601]  And I'll tell you why it hurts me.
[00:48:02.601 --> 00:48:06.484]  I don't like admitting it's real to myself, and I want to explain something to you.
[00:48:06.484 --> 00:48:16.592]  When I put out headlines like, the globalists must be arrested, their system dismantled now, our billions will die, that moves it one second closer on the clock for them to smash me flatter than a pancake.
[00:48:16.592 --> 00:48:17.873]  And I'm a tough guy.
[00:48:17.873 --> 00:48:18.994]  I got a lot of courage.
[00:48:18.994 --> 00:48:20.035]  I'm not going to back down.
[00:48:20.035 --> 00:48:23.378]  But I don't enjoy messing with these people.
[00:48:23.378 --> 00:48:27.141]  This isn't some macho exercise for me to sit up here and poke these people.
[00:48:27.901 --> 00:48:37.685]  They're attacking us, they're not going to stop, and the God I follow spiritually tells me to fight them!
[00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:43.347]  And God's pissed off at me right now that I'm not doing enough.
[00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:47.168]  And I don't know how the rest of you are even operating.
[00:48:47.168 --> 00:48:51.489]  I know a lot of you are pissed off, but man, we are being assaulted.
[00:48:51.489 --> 00:48:53.110]  Our laws are all being violated.
[00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.591]  Every canon of basic freedom is being crapped on.
[00:48:57.085 --> 00:49:08.290]  You know, yesterday, somewhere here in my stack, I covered the rainbow dildo butt monkey.
[00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.872]  And I saw comments and things and people thinking I made that up.
[00:49:11.872 --> 00:49:13.413]  I didn't read half of it.
[00:49:13.413 --> 00:49:16.234]  The man had a fake penis on with a fake
[00:49:17.606 --> 00:49:23.830]  Butt naked with a fake vagina hanging down like a turkey gobbler and fake women's breasts.
[00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.451]  I wouldn't even show it on air.
[00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:30.435]  And little kids came up and sat on the dildo at the library.
[00:49:30.435 --> 00:49:33.617]  So, you see, it's worse than what I just told you.
[00:49:33.617 --> 00:49:34.897]  You want me to show it to you?
[00:49:34.897 --> 00:49:36.759]  Our TV stations will take us off air.
[00:49:36.759 --> 00:49:38.180]  It's not fit for adults to see.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.082]  It's only good for five-year-olds!
[00:49:41.082 --> 00:49:44.564]  You think they're funding that on purpose because they're playing freaking games?
[00:49:46.354 --> 00:49:48.336]  These people ain't playing games!
[00:49:48.336 --> 00:49:52.439]  They're gonna kill everybody!
[00:49:52.439 --> 00:49:57.002]  Yeah, don't show the bottom.
[00:49:57.002 --> 00:50:06.689]  Governments send men with fake genitals hanging down and plastic butts and plastic breasts and the women go and put their children on their laps as part of a satanic ritual.
[00:50:12.302 --> 00:50:16.646]  It's all to condition us to accept anything they want.
[00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:24.634]  It is a satanic, Jacobin, French Revolution 2.0!
[00:50:24.634 --> 00:50:30.640]  And the idiots going along with this thinking they're gonna get power out of it are fools.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.742]  Alright, look, I haven't gotten to the Tucker Carlson thing yet.
[00:50:32.742 --> 00:50:35.305]  You even need me to play Tucker Carlson.
[00:50:35.305 --> 00:50:36.566]  Doing a great job, calmly.
[00:50:39.008 --> 00:50:46.033]  Saying, this is unprecedented, unmitigated evil.
[00:50:46.033 --> 00:50:47.533]  I told you guys not to show it.
[00:50:47.533 --> 00:50:52.997]  Take it down.
[00:50:52.997 --> 00:50:56.719]  Our adult TV stations don't want what children are subjected to, to be seen.
[00:50:56.719 --> 00:50:57.580]  I'm not against TV stations.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:57.880]  I understand.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.640]  I don't want to look at it either.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.182]  If you want to see it, it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:01.182 --> 00:51:03.704]  But I just noticed people thought I was exaggerating.
[00:51:03.704 --> 00:51:07.206]  Oh, there's not a thing called Rainbow Dildo Butt Monkey.
[00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:11.204]  Oh, that's what it is.
[00:51:11.204 --> 00:51:15.027]  And the liberal women take their small children up to sit in the lap of these people.
[00:51:15.027 --> 00:51:18.850]  And it's turned out a bunch of them are aggravated sex offenders that rape children.
[00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:19.230]  Oh, really?
[00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:20.071]  You think so?
[00:51:20.071 --> 00:51:24.174]  God, that's a stretch.
[00:51:24.174 --> 00:51:28.017]  And you look at the faces of these crazy men, they look like they've been to hell and back.
[00:51:28.017 --> 00:51:31.060]  They look like they've been to another dimension, because they have.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.461]  The lights are on.
[00:51:32.461 --> 00:51:34.683]  Ain't nobody home.
[00:51:39.167 --> 00:51:52.933]  You know, the photos of the Democrats loaded up on private jets being flown to D.C., drinking and partying and smoozing while they leave for the second time so the legislature can't pass laws.
[00:51:52.933 --> 00:51:56.235]  You just look at how simple-minded and dumb these smiling Democrats are.
[00:51:56.235 --> 00:52:00.177]  You know, they're bad enough.
[00:52:00.177 --> 00:52:05.359]  What about the Republicans presiding over all this?
[00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.320]  Because in the deep state, the Democrats are going for broke.
[00:52:09.386 --> 00:52:13.449]  They'll be nothing left when they're done.
[00:52:13.449 --> 00:52:15.010]  He now says he's going to have them arrested.
[00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:23.197]  Yeah, well, you can't arrest them under state law for walking off their sworn duty at the legislature if they're not here.
[00:52:23.197 --> 00:52:32.784]  So you need to just say that they didn't vote and have an emergency quorum and override their ass because you got the votes to pass your law.
[00:52:32.784 --> 00:52:35.006]  Yeah, that's them on a bus going to the private jet.
[00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:38.769]  Photos of them, no mask on the private jet, but they sure as hell want you
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:47.604]  So wear your mask when you're a kid, because they're an abusive and a power cult doing what the mega corporations and mega banks want.
[00:52:47.604 --> 00:52:52.967]  Well, I'm not funded by the big mega banks, and if you want to keep us on air however long we're supposed to, I'll just tell you this.
[00:52:52.967 --> 00:52:54.428]  Infowars is history.
[00:52:54.428 --> 00:52:55.649]  What you've done is history.
[00:52:55.649 --> 00:52:57.250]  And I mean that as a double entendre.
[00:52:57.250 --> 00:53:02.753]  We've done historical things, and we can easily be history very, very soon in the timetable coming.
[00:53:02.753 --> 00:53:09.737]  And that means everybody's going to be off the air, except for a few select, loveless operations with the internet kill switch they've already got, and that's in the news.
[00:53:10.874 --> 00:53:15.957]  Hell, the internet kill switch is just the next step once they're, quote, reading all your private messages.
[00:53:15.957 --> 00:53:17.238]  Better watch what you say.
[00:53:17.238 --> 00:53:18.819]  Oh, we're going to send you a message.
[00:53:18.819 --> 00:53:24.222]  You're being watched by the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Democratic Party.
[00:53:24.222 --> 00:53:25.883]  That's in their words.
[00:53:25.883 --> 00:53:32.747]  We're watching what you say to your husband, to your wife, to your boss, to your employees, to your pastor.
[00:53:32.747 --> 00:53:34.608]  You're like, well, that can't happen.
[00:53:34.608 --> 00:53:36.249]  Damn it can't happen.
[00:53:36.249 --> 00:53:38.791]  It is happening.
[00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:39.191]  So listen.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:54:02.755]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film for our war chest so that we can stay on air as long as possible and know that we have deep earth crystal, highest quality atomic iodine, so it goes right into your cells, in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60% off for the spray bottle, exact same iodine, exact same amount.
[00:54:02.755 --> 00:54:05.117]  We're just doing 60 because that's what I said.
[00:54:05.117 --> 00:54:06.558]  And we got 40 on the dropper.
[00:54:07.248 --> 00:54:17.514]  Both are going to sell out the dropper quicker than the spray bottle, and that's why the spray bottle is 60 and the dropper is 40% off.
[00:54:17.514 --> 00:54:19.675]  And it changed my life.
[00:54:19.675 --> 00:54:20.356]  It does so much for me.
[00:54:20.356 --> 00:54:23.097]  I remember to take it, the energy, the focus.
[00:54:23.097 --> 00:54:25.099]  It's just, it's about libido.
[00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:26.059]  It's about everything.
[00:54:26.059 --> 00:54:27.360]  It is essential in your body.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.782]  They bombard you with the bad halogens, the fluoride, the bromine, the chloride.
[00:54:30.782 --> 00:54:32.543]  This is the good halogen iodine.
[00:54:32.543 --> 00:54:35.585]  Most iodine is bound to other things your body can't absorb it.
[00:54:36.678 --> 00:54:39.541]  This is not bound, so your body can't absorb it.
[00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:41.002]  Thousands of five-star reviews.

[00:55:16.643 --> 00:55:24.986]  It's made out of a bunch of different types of wheat sprouts and other sprouts that are just over the top with all the amino acids, a bunch of the vitamins and the minerals.

[00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:39.365]  All right, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:55:39.365 --> 00:55:46.893]  Now's the time more than ever to be spreading the word because everything we're laying out, people are about to see if they get hit by the globalist takeover.
[00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:51.817]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:55:51.817 --> 00:55:52.198]  Welcome.
[00:55:52.198 --> 00:55:52.658]  Go ahead.
[00:55:52.658 --> 00:55:53.959]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:55:53.959 --> 00:55:54.520]  Good, Bob.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.621]  Great last caller.
[00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:58.664]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:55:58.664 --> 00:56:04.369]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:56:04.369 --> 00:56:06.471]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[00:56:06.471 --> 00:56:06.912]  All right.
[00:56:06.912 --> 00:56:08.173]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:56:08.173 --> 00:56:09.114]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:56:09.114 --> 00:56:09.394]  Go ahead.
[00:56:09.474 --> 00:56:11.016]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:56:11.016 --> 00:56:14.039]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[00:56:14.039 --> 00:56:15.701]  The X-Tune does wonders.
[00:56:15.701 --> 00:56:18.024]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[00:56:18.024 --> 00:56:20.907]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[00:56:20.907 --> 00:56:22.208]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:22.869]  You're on the air.
[00:56:22.869 --> 00:56:23.409]  Thanks for rolling.
[00:56:23.409 --> 00:56:23.790]  Go ahead.
[00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:25.492]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[00:56:25.492 --> 00:56:26.253]  It's an honor.
[00:56:26.253 --> 00:56:26.533]  Honor.
[00:56:26.533 --> 00:56:27.073]  Talk to you.
[00:56:27.073 --> 00:56:27.434]  Awesome.
[00:56:27.994 --> 00:56:31.817]  Uh, so, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[00:56:31.817 --> 00:56:33.899]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:56:33.899 --> 00:56:36.241]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[00:56:36.241 --> 00:56:37.722]  Uh, and it helps in the bedroom.
[00:56:37.722 --> 00:56:39.323]  So, just number one for if you were there.
[00:56:39.323 --> 00:56:40.384]  Well, it definitely works.
[00:56:40.384 --> 00:56:42.005]  It's not a joke.
[00:56:42.005 --> 00:56:50.492]  Absolutely.
[00:56:50.492 --> 00:56:53.875]  What are champions made of?
[00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:55.016]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:57:01.575 --> 00:57:03.356]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:03.356 --> 00:57:05.017]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:05.017 --> 00:57:06.478]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:06.478 --> 00:57:07.699]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:07.699 --> 00:57:08.780]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.361]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:31.232]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[00:57:31.232 --> 00:57:34.293]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:57:34.293 --> 00:57:34.513]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.513 --> 00:57:34.573]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.573 --> 00:57:34.733]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:34.733 --> 00:57:36.113]  Use the InfoWarsStore at night.
[00:57:36.113 --> 00:57:36.213]  888-233-3139.
[00:57:36.213 --> 00:57:36.353]  888-233-3139.
[00:57:36.353 --> 00:57:36.513]  888-233-3139.
[00:57:36.513 --> 00:57:37.773]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:37.773 --> 00:57:39.034]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:58.337 --> 00:58:20.741]  Alright, I'm going to do my best to calm down.
[00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:27.502]  And then I'm going to come back in the next segment and calmly get into their master plan.
[00:58:28.706 --> 00:58:30.687]  And how to stop them.
[00:58:30.687 --> 00:58:35.648]  But I understand a lot of people aren't going to listen now, so you'll listen later when it happens.
[00:58:35.648 --> 00:58:38.689]  And then I'm going to tell you in that scenario how you can beat them as well.
[00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:42.630]  But then it's going to be a lot harder, and obviously more are going to die.
[00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:43.850]  But they will be defeated.
[00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.931]  In fact, they're on a kamikaze mission for their god.
[00:58:46.931 --> 00:58:48.291]  They're very, very satanic.
[00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:55.133]  But let's go ahead and prepare for this information with the special report, Humanity vs. the Eugenics Cult.
[00:58:55.133 --> 00:58:55.793]  Choose your side.
[00:59:00.515 --> 00:59:11.523]  This isn't the pop eugenics of, let's strengthen the race of humanity by promoting breeding of individuals with higher IQs or things like this.
[00:59:11.523 --> 00:59:13.084]  And of course, that leads to hell.
[00:59:13.084 --> 00:59:14.225]  We know where that goes.
[00:59:14.225 --> 00:59:16.267]  That's why it's been rejected by the general public.
[00:59:16.267 --> 00:59:17.788]  We had major wars over it.
[00:59:17.788 --> 00:59:25.173]  People who are crippled or mentally handicapped are gassed to death on the grounds that they are, unto mention, they are inferior beings.
[00:59:25.173 --> 00:59:25.994]  But now it's back.
[00:59:27.155 --> 00:59:29.217]  And it's literally trying to sterilize our children.
[00:59:29.217 --> 00:59:31.958]  It's trying to force deadly things into our bodies.
[00:59:31.958 --> 00:59:40.964]  You know, it is almost inexplicable why people, when they see the data in front of them, that they don't get vaccinated.
[00:59:40.964 --> 00:59:41.344]  I repeat.
[00:59:41.954 --> 00:59:46.536]  There will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[00:59:46.536 --> 01:00:00.002]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again in how we are used to normal in the old fashion.
[01:00:00.662 --> 01:00:03.483]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[01:00:03.483 --> 01:00:07.905]  And what we really need to do at this point is to make vaccination the easy choice.
[01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:11.286]  It needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated.
[01:00:11.286 --> 01:00:12.647]  Right now, it's kind of the opposite.
[01:00:12.647 --> 01:00:13.147]  It's fine.
[01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:14.848]  I mean, it's easy if you're unvaccinated.
[01:00:14.848 --> 01:00:16.869]  You can do everything you want to do anyway.
[01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:22.791]  But at some point, these mandates by workplaces, by schools, I think it will be important to say, hey, you can opt out.
[01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:25.412]  But if you want to opt out, you have to sign these forms.
[01:00:25.412 --> 01:00:27.333]  You have to get twice-weekly testing.
[01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.954]  Basically, we need to make getting vaccinated the easy choice.
[01:00:30.603 --> 01:00:39.265]  The globalists have triggered their planetary depopulation operation that they promised they were going to do.
[01:00:39.265 --> 01:00:41.885]  You know, they're not putting fluoride in the water to lower our IQs.
[01:00:41.885 --> 01:00:59.288]  And then you get Obama's White House czar, John P. Holdren, who co-wrote the big 1,100-page textbook, Ecoscience, published in 1974, that is a PhD-level book for the elites on how to carry out world government and depopulation and how inoculations
[01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:04.373]  And fluoride in the water will be used to lower fertility and IQ.
[01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:10.959]  Brain trauma surgeons are saying they've never seen brains look like this.
[01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:14.442]  Swollen, bloody messes.
[01:01:14.442 --> 01:01:18.926]  Holes eaten in all the tissue.
[01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:20.127]  Liquification.
[01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:28.591]  Annie Van Geest was known as a supermom, a master multitasker, and a staunch animal rescue supporter.
[01:01:28.591 --> 01:01:35.972]  Her death certificate notes a natural death specifically from an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain.
[01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:46.194]  In a statement, her family says the 35-year-old wife and mother of four died, quote, as the result of complications after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:01:46.194 --> 01:01:51.015]  But at this point, neither doctors nor the CDC have any way to know that for sure.
[01:01:51.055 --> 01:01:52.495]  Sure.
[01:01:52.495 --> 01:02:06.119]  Now the most trusted people come out and say this is eating the brains, and it's in the literature, it does it, and it's in all the studies, and holding America and the world underwater, drowning us, killing us, is big tech hiding this.
[01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:08.299]  And I got another article right here.
[01:02:08.299 --> 01:02:16.161]  45, who got a job at John Hopkins Hospital, dies in John Hopkins Hospital after she got the second shot.
[01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:19.842]  And they said, yeah, the vaccine reaction swole her brain
[01:02:21.468 --> 01:02:24.409]  Until all the blood vessels popped.
[01:02:24.409 --> 01:02:27.950]  And it was a long, horrifyingly painful death, the family said.
[01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:33.051]  She went from being in great shape and totally happy to deader than a doornail.
[01:02:33.051 --> 01:02:36.832]  And they're killing everybody right in front of us and testing to see what we'll do.
[01:02:36.832 --> 01:02:41.433]  Because they know that we will adapt by not overcoming.
[01:02:41.433 --> 01:02:43.094]  We will adapt by submitting.
[01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:47.735]  Because they've got us in that captured, learned helplessness, mass Stockholm Syndrome place.
[01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:56.733]  We tried to stop it, but the new owner's here.
[01:02:56.733 --> 01:03:03.077]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:06.659]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[01:03:06.659 --> 01:03:08.520]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.582]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:12.423]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[01:03:12.423 --> 01:03:13.684]  But what's in that food?
[01:03:13.684 --> 01:03:13.964]  Iodine.
[01:03:14.264 --> 01:03:18.847]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[01:03:18.847 --> 01:03:20.789]  And the food itself is lacking.
[01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:24.211]  That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine.
[01:03:24.211 --> 01:03:28.674]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposed to need to have because they want control.
[01:03:28.674 --> 01:03:30.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information's powerful.
[01:03:30.796 --> 01:03:32.277]  Our products are just as powerful.

[01:04:08.394 --> 01:04:16.057]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:16.057 --> 01:04:27.121]  So, the Rockefeller family, with the British Empire, set up the United Nations to establish world government for the express goal of depopulation.
[01:04:27.121 --> 01:04:28.501]  You can look that up for yourself.
[01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:29.342]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:04:29.342 --> 01:04:30.962]  They're very proud of it.
[01:04:30.962 --> 01:04:35.764]  And the very people that say they want to depopulate us to, quote, save the Earth, they've cast themselves as the heroes.
[01:04:36.693 --> 01:04:41.256]  They are the very ones now saying we all need to take this shot to save our lives.
[01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:42.196]  They love us so much.
[01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:44.457]  And we look at all the studies.
[01:04:44.457 --> 01:04:45.938]  It doesn't protect you.
[01:04:45.938 --> 01:04:48.620]  Doesn't protect you from the coronavirus or COVID.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.601]  In fact, most people getting sick and dying have had the vaccine.
[01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:54.323]  And now they're saying, oh, looks like the immunity doesn't work.
[01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:58.285]  Pfizer says, need a booster shot.
[01:04:58.285 --> 01:05:01.447]  Well, Bill Gates said a year and a half ago, once this all came out, you need five shots a year.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.581]  It's all been pre-programmed.
[01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:04.761]  It's all a lie.
[01:05:04.761 --> 01:05:08.942]  And so when they get you to do one thing, oh, just take the shot, life will go back to normal.
[01:05:08.942 --> 01:05:11.643]  Oh, sorry, still wear the mask, gotta have more shots.
[01:05:11.643 --> 01:05:14.304]  Oh, and we're still gonna say you're not essential.
[01:05:14.304 --> 01:05:18.665]  Oh, and you need a digital ID to prove you've got it.
[01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:29.488]  And then in the future, they admit, oh, that's part of a carbon tax, where we tell you what is essential travel, what isn't, and so we're gonna tax you when you go places you're not supposed to, or when you eat the wrong meal, or do the wrong thing.
[01:05:29.488 --> 01:05:30.929]  This is all being officially
[01:05:31.724 --> 01:05:38.106]  Announced right now in Europe, in Australia, but then it comes here next.
[01:05:38.106 --> 01:05:44.289]  Canada's still under lockdown and their head health minister says to stop people talking.
[01:05:44.289 --> 01:05:45.789]  And you're like, well, that's just insane.
[01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:47.450]  They've played the clip.
[01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:48.210]  People can't believe it.
[01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:56.693]  Well, now the Democrats come out to press conference and say, yeah, we can't let people question Dr. Fauci and the UN.
[01:05:56.693 --> 01:05:59.294]  Just like big tech says you can't question them when they suppress
[01:06:00.452 --> 01:06:03.935]  99% effective treatments for deadly vaccines.
[01:06:03.935 --> 01:06:09.579]  Even though they ran the Wuhan lab, and they own the vaccine patents, and they have total conflict of interest, and they're known liars.
[01:06:09.579 --> 01:06:17.464]  Trust the science, which means don't question, which is the opposite of science, and do whatever they say.
[01:06:17.464 --> 01:06:24.469]  And then Klaus Schwab writes books and says, on French TV, there's going to be a crisis soon.
[01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:27.831]  And once the crisis happens with the virus,
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.621]  It will never go back to normal.
[01:06:30.621 --> 01:06:33.842]  The lockdown will cut into society and will never be reversed.
[01:06:33.842 --> 01:06:35.843]  There will be no going back to normal.
[01:06:35.843 --> 01:06:37.464]  I just played the clip last segment.
[01:06:37.464 --> 01:06:38.424]  That cue would have to end place.
[01:06:38.424 --> 01:06:41.125]  Right in the first minute.
[01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:45.247]  No one is going back to normal, ever!
[01:06:45.247 --> 01:06:49.189]  And it will save you, save the Earth, by cutting carbon.
[01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:57.741]  And now they're saying with the new global ID you have on that iPhone or next on a bracelet and then a chip, he says.
[01:06:57.741 --> 01:06:59.502]  The chip is next.
[01:06:59.502 --> 01:07:03.403]  He says to buy and sell.
[01:07:03.403 --> 01:07:04.484]  They're already abusing us.
[01:07:04.484 --> 01:07:05.384]  They're already lying to us.
[01:07:05.384 --> 01:07:08.965]  And the DNC says, we've got to watch you in live time.
[01:07:08.965 --> 01:07:09.886]  That's the issue.
[01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:20.010]  Surveil your private text messages with a special trained consortium that know disinformation on medical and political and on the elections.
[01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:20.070]  Oh,
[01:07:24.076 --> 01:07:27.318]  Oh my goodness!
[01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:28.898]  Well, who ran the fact-checking?
[01:07:28.898 --> 01:07:30.779]  It was the Wuhan Lab.
[01:07:30.779 --> 01:07:40.464]  Had more than 20 people employed, including the head of the COVID-19 vaccine program, which put out the parameters to all the big pharma companies of what they wanted them to do.
[01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:42.305]  Don't scan the RNA of the virus.
[01:07:42.305 --> 01:07:45.747]  We want all these vaccines to block the protein of the virus.
[01:07:45.747 --> 01:07:52.050]  And so, that woman, that medical doctor, look her up, was the main fact-checker with Peter Daszak,
[01:07:53.015 --> 01:07:56.018]  For Facebook and the British Medical Journal.
[01:07:56.018 --> 01:07:57.520]  They ran the program.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.242]  They ran the operation.
[01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:06.470]  And then they ran the fact-checking parameters of what was allowed on Twitter, YouTube, Google, Facebook, and Apple.
[01:08:08.846 --> 01:08:13.791]  Because if you're going to launch an attack like this and take over society with it, you better have all the gatekeepers in place.
[01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:16.434]  You better have all the people that run the surveillance in place.
[01:08:16.434 --> 01:08:18.276]  You better have control of law enforcement.
[01:08:18.276 --> 01:08:20.378]  You better have control of the National Health Services.
[01:08:20.378 --> 01:08:22.200]  You better have control of the WHO.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.003]  Yeah, there she is.
[01:08:25.003 --> 01:08:30.408]  Ed, Facebook fact checker, worked at Wuhan Biolab, ruled out virus leak while debunking articles, and ran
[01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:43.847]  The anti-COVID-19 vaccine program that we know they had listed in an IMF World Bank document in 2018, and she ran the program for?
[01:08:43.847 --> 01:08:44.907]  Peter Daszak!
[01:08:44.907 --> 01:08:45.847]  And who did he work for?
[01:08:45.847 --> 01:08:51.670]  Oh, Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:57.151]  And they've got the patent, she's got the patent on the vaccine.
[01:08:57.151 --> 01:08:58.492]  And you go, wait, the vaccine?
[01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:09.997]  Why do you think J&J, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and all the others that the West made don't attack the RNA of the virus?
[01:09:09.997 --> 01:09:11.238]  Because that wouldn't hurt you.
[01:09:11.238 --> 01:09:13.179]  Might make you sick with a side effect.
[01:09:13.179 --> 01:09:14.040]  Might be a contaminated vaccine.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.841]  That's when you usually have a problem.
[01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:19.564]  Because, you know, if there's something else in there, your body will learn immunity to that too.
[01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:21.946]  Whether it's fetal tissue, peanuts, whatever.
[01:09:21.946 --> 01:09:24.308]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:25.763 --> 01:09:41.368]  It's all for the protein, which again is in all our bodies, which Fauci did big studies at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and University of Texas, Galveston, knowing it killed almost all the rats and all the ferrets when they gave him a vaccine for the spike protein.
[01:09:41.368 --> 01:09:48.090]  They developed it, they tested it for a decade, and now they're murdering you with it!
[01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:49.111]  Liberal!
[01:09:49.111 --> 01:09:53.432]  And it's in the news, we'll cover it next segment, that
[01:09:56.917 --> 01:10:03.618]  There's more deaths last week from COVID vaccines, they admit, than from COVID, which most of that's fake anyways.
[01:10:03.618 --> 01:10:07.579]  And they're just testing the gaslighting and the murdering of us in public.
[01:10:07.579 --> 01:10:08.439]  And so what's the answer?
[01:10:08.439 --> 01:10:09.759]  Well, I told you what's the answer.
[01:10:09.759 --> 01:10:19.541]  The globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now or billions will die.
[01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:24.462]  You know, I don't fear what they're going to do to me for standing up for humanity and the right thing.
[01:10:24.462 --> 01:10:26.262]  I fear God for this planet.
[01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:33.994]  And I never ask God for anything but that I have strength to be a good person and to make me be an upright person and give me discernment.
[01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:36.355]  God's given me discernment.
[01:10:36.355 --> 01:10:40.859]  But I have prayed that in all this, that my family be spared, but it's all in God's plan.
[01:10:40.859 --> 01:10:51.247]  And I don't know if God will answer that selfish prayer I have, but I just simply hope that all of you realize that you better get right with God right now, because your church isn't going to tell you about this.
[01:10:52.273 --> 01:10:53.634]  Your synagogue's not going to tell you about it.
[01:10:53.634 --> 01:10:55.296]  Your imam's not going to tell you about it.
[01:10:55.296 --> 01:10:57.457]  Your local liberal thing isn't going to tell you about it.
[01:10:57.457 --> 01:10:58.839]  Because they're all working for the system.
[01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:08.847]  They're all trying to just be non-threatening, and be little betas, and go along to get along, and just receive the information from on high and the globalists.
[01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:15.432]  But you don't have to have me tell you a year and a half ago that once they do lockdowns, then they'll say, take an ID, take a shot, then you can have freedom.
[01:11:15.432 --> 01:11:16.754]  Even when you do it, you don't get freedom.
[01:11:16.754 --> 01:11:18.135]  They got you in a bear trap.
[01:11:18.135 --> 01:11:19.336]  They got you by the balls.
[01:11:23.596 --> 01:11:27.519]  And submitting to them only makes it worse.
[01:11:27.519 --> 01:11:43.072]  When you submit to the first 15 days to slow the curve, to flatten the curve, and then, oh, just wear a mask for a month, and it's a year and a half, and oh, just, and then as soon as real opposition mounts, at governmental levels, they pull back, okay, you can reopen, ah, we gotta reclose!
[01:11:43.072 --> 01:11:51.959]  Every time we mount opposition, and I'm gonna stop the dominoes from falling, and put a hand up, they go, oh, no, no, no, we're not gonna fight, we're not gonna push this, so you remove your hand,
[01:11:53.234 --> 01:11:55.396]  And they can keep knocking the dominoes down.
[01:11:55.396 --> 01:12:07.084]  You have to just bull through and say, they blocked the treatments, they committed war crimes, they committed crimes against humanity, they rolled out an illegal vaccine they knew was dangerous, violating the Nuremberg Code.
[01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:14.609]  We gotta go on the offense against them or they're gonna continue to do this through the process of slow attrition and control.
[01:12:14.609 --> 01:12:15.470]  You see these dominoes?
[01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:20.213]  If you're a TV viewer, they are a archetype.
[01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:28.645]  They are a image, a microcosm of all of us.
[01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:32.247]  And so you think, go along with just one thing they do and it'll all be over.
[01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:32.788]  It'll stop.
[01:12:32.788 --> 01:12:41.193]  No, when you go along with one thing, then it lets them do the next thing, and the next thing, and the next thing, and then very quickly, you're off the edge of the cliff.
[01:12:41.193 --> 01:12:49.699]  Very quickly, it's game over.
[01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.119]  You see that?
[01:12:51.030 --> 01:13:02.000]  And you see, ladies and gentlemen, the dominoes are falling right now, and we need somebody, a governor, a religious leader, maybe an old lady who refuses to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:12.049]  We need somebody to stick their hand in front of the dominoes and stop them, because these dominoes aren't falling for good, they're falling for bad, because the globalists knew humanity had awoken.
[01:13:12.049 --> 01:13:13.611]  They knew their new world order was in trouble.
[01:13:13.611 --> 01:13:14.912]  They already had these plans on the shelf.
[01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:15.773]  Later, they depopulate.
[01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:19.583]  They let her distract if anybody ever resisted them.
[01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:33.474]  Well, we did resist them, so they implemented the global crisis to make us the enemy, to make us all suspect, to be able to disappear and arrest whoever they wanted, to be able to surveil us, to be able to tell us we're reading your private text messages for your own good!
[01:13:33.474 --> 01:13:37.937]  My God, we've gone over the cliff, haven't we?
[01:13:37.937 --> 01:13:39.879]  But there's still time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:39.879 --> 01:13:44.042]  There's still time, and I'm going to tell you what it's going to look like if you submit.
[01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:45.303]  Submission is death!
[01:13:46.357 --> 01:13:48.859]  Resistance is victory!
[01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:51.322]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:13:51.322 --> 01:13:58.088]  Tomorrow's news, today!
[01:13:58.088 --> 01:14:00.169]  Your voice counts.
[01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:05.234]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:14:05.234 --> 01:14:07.836]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:14:07.836 --> 01:14:08.577]  They know you're angry.
[01:14:09.298 --> 01:14:14.705]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:14:55.829 --> 01:15:03.996]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[01:15:03.996 --> 01:15:12.783]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[01:15:12.783 --> 01:15:19.729]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:22.070]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:24.793]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:25.413]  I think?
[01:15:55.813 --> 01:15:58.275]  The world is awakening.
[01:15:58.275 --> 01:16:01.757]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:13.063]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[01:16:13.063 --> 01:16:15.685]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[01:16:16.878 --> 01:16:22.846]  The truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[01:16:22.846 --> 01:16:25.329]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:16:25.974 --> 01:16:31.799]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[01:16:31.799 --> 01:16:36.823]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust the plan of God's justice.
[01:16:36.823 --> 01:16:38.264]  That is invincible.
[01:16:38.264 --> 01:16:41.707]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[01:16:41.707 --> 01:16:47.451]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:51.515]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[01:16:51.515 --> 01:16:55.318]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:15.207]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:15.207 --> 01:17:23.230]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:27.732]  So I became aware 30 plus years ago of a globalist depopulation program
[01:17:28.803 --> 01:17:51.792]  I read it in books by people like J. Edward Griffin, written in the 60s and 70s, and I went and looked it up at the library, and just found it incredible that, wow, I'd read about Hitler, and I'd read about Stalin and Mao, and the things they'd done, killing hundreds of millions of people, total.
[01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:56.634]  Then I learned they'd been financed by these very people from Anthony Sutton, the main archivist for Congress, who had all the documents.
[01:17:57.811 --> 01:18:00.453]  And leaked them, the classified documents.
[01:18:00.453 --> 01:18:02.955]  And I remember going to the library, and it was all real.
[01:18:02.955 --> 01:18:05.357]  What I read in these books was true.
[01:18:05.357 --> 01:18:10.902]  I was holding the print-offs of the newspapers in my hands.
[01:18:10.902 --> 01:18:14.685]  And, you know, people would tell me, hey, let's go out and get drunk.
[01:18:14.685 --> 01:18:19.989]  And I'd already been a party animal before that, but I really woke up about 17, and I'd say, I don't want to drink anymore.
[01:18:19.989 --> 01:18:22.131]  It was a lot of years I didn't even drink or anything.
[01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.872]  I got back to it later.
[01:18:23.872 --> 01:18:26.154]  And when I discovered this, I just felt a mission.
[01:18:27.518 --> 01:18:33.923]  That the same people that funded Hitler, Stalin, and Mao are in control and are going to do all this?
[01:18:33.923 --> 01:18:34.684]  They're taking over?
[01:18:34.684 --> 01:18:38.227]  They got this whole plan?
[01:18:38.227 --> 01:18:41.610]  And here we are!
[01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:44.152]  Gosh almighty, I'm 47.
[01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:47.935]  I've been awake since about 16, but really got involved about 17.
[01:18:47.935 --> 01:18:49.536]  How many years ago was that?
[01:18:49.536 --> 01:18:52.459]  They thought I was a space alien at the UT library.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.401]  When I was talking to librarians, and they were like, are you a college student?
[01:18:56.401 --> 01:18:58.122]  I'm like, no, I'm here for these documents.
[01:18:58.122 --> 01:19:01.524]  And well, that's in the stacks of the microfilm back.
[01:19:01.524 --> 01:19:03.505]  Sure, I'll get it for you.
[01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:04.185]  I'd be like, oh, is that $10?
[01:19:04.185 --> 01:19:05.846]  No, I'll just give it to you free.
[01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:08.707]  Well, what are you looking up the New York Times for from 1976?
[01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:09.607]  Well, David Rockefeller.
[01:19:09.607 --> 01:19:12.989]  And I'd be sitting with a librarian reading, and they're like, that's pretty crazy, isn't it?
[01:19:12.989 --> 01:19:14.069]  Yeah.
[01:19:14.069 --> 01:19:16.930]  We're going to bring in communism, like Mao Tse Tung said.
[01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:20.312]  And now you got Charlie Munger standing on TV with Warren Buffett.
[01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:29.260]  I mean, this is real, folks, but it's one thing to be knowing it's coming.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:35.842]  I liken it to maybe in that slow motion, we've all been in a car wreck or we've all seen something horrible in our life where it happens and you just can't believe you're witnessing it.
[01:19:35.842 --> 01:19:49.106]  I saw a Corvette driving 125 miles an hour, blow a tire and flip in a race on a highway over a lake and on a bridge on a lake and explode and people's heads, the guy's head got cut off, one person's arm part way.
[01:19:50.117 --> 01:19:58.124]  And by the time I pulled over in the truck, seconds after and got out, I was watching the guy's head almost completely cut off and the body was trying to get up.
[01:19:58.124 --> 01:20:01.507]  And then I saw this other person's arm half cut off.
[01:20:01.507 --> 01:20:02.709]  And you know why it was so personal?
[01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:10.135]  It was my friends, and I was behind them racing with them.
[01:20:10.135 --> 01:20:15.200]  But we were in a truck, and I wasn't even driving my, I wasn't even 16 yet, I was 15.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.061]  My buddy was driving, he was 16.
[01:20:17.325 --> 01:20:18.586]  And they were racing.
[01:20:18.586 --> 01:20:20.167]  And I remember my buddy saying, I'm not speeding.
[01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.327]  I'm not going past 120.
[01:20:21.327 --> 01:20:23.228]  So we were back from them.
[01:20:23.228 --> 01:20:24.669]  But about 20 cars.
[01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:31.692]  But by the time that thing blew out and then spun and all that happened, by the time that happened and we pulled up, it was just instantaneous.
[01:20:31.692 --> 01:20:36.515]  And I get out of the car and they flipped over onto the railroad trestle right there.
[01:20:37.722 --> 01:20:40.344]  And I just sat there and looked at that and I watched that.
[01:20:40.344 --> 01:20:41.225]  It's the same thing.
[01:20:41.225 --> 01:20:46.169]  It's like the slow motion of that Corvette spinning and all those pieces and watching those bodies fly.
[01:20:46.169 --> 01:20:48.270]  And that's the slow motion.
[01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.473]  I mean, they really just killed 20 million people.
[01:20:51.473 --> 01:20:56.657]  That means all the Facebook workers, all the Twitter workers, all the YouTube workers, all of you!
[01:20:57.466 --> 01:21:01.027]  That blocked the Ivermectin and blocked the Hydroxychloroquine.
[01:21:01.027 --> 01:21:02.947]  You helped murder all those people.
[01:21:02.947 --> 01:21:10.189]  And then you helped murder the 20-something million that have starved to death on top of all the other dead people.
[01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:14.850]  You did that!
[01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.591]  And you don't even care.
[01:21:16.591 --> 01:21:18.111]  Because it's modern warfare.
[01:21:18.111 --> 01:21:21.332]  You get to sit back like a technocrat and turn the economy off.
[01:21:21.332 --> 01:21:24.392]  And then all you got to do working at Big Tech is censor everybody talking about it.
[01:21:24.392 --> 01:21:26.253]  And you sit back and watch everybody die.
[01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:29.561]  And then you point your finger at me and call me a racist.
[01:21:29.561 --> 01:21:33.062]  What the hell does that even mean?
[01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:37.223]  I said I'd play the Tucker Carlson thing, and I got all this other news to hit.
[01:21:37.223 --> 01:21:43.244]  And, uh, I'm gonna have to take some time off.
[01:21:43.244 --> 01:21:43.964]  I'm not complaining.
[01:21:43.964 --> 01:21:47.905]  You know, I almost feel like my mission is complete.
[01:21:47.905 --> 01:21:48.505]  I really do.
[01:21:48.505 --> 01:21:53.026]  I feel like we're here now, and if people don't do anything about it,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:10.831]  It's not that I don't want to keep working, I don't want to keep talking, I just at a certain point... Why do I have to go find the Politico article saying we're spying on all your text messages that are going to control them and make a big deal about it?
[01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:11.871]  Why?
[01:22:11.871 --> 01:22:17.695]  It almost becomes absurd that it's us over and over and over again that have basic instincts.
[01:22:17.695 --> 01:22:18.856]  And listen,
[01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:22.910]  It's not that I don't want to keep fighting these people.
[01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:27.313]  With all my heart, I do.
[01:22:27.313 --> 01:22:32.036]  I just... I can't take it anymore.
[01:22:32.036 --> 01:22:34.197]  I don't think you can take it anymore either.
[01:22:34.197 --> 01:22:36.078]  I mean, we're destroying our planet.
[01:22:36.078 --> 01:22:40.001]  They're not killing everybody to save the Earth.
[01:22:40.001 --> 01:22:42.002]  They're doing it to take full control and play God.
[01:22:42.002 --> 01:22:46.465]  And then you just look at the average leftist.
[01:22:46.465 --> 01:22:50.107]  I mean, they look like demon possessed creatures.
[01:22:50.107 --> 01:22:50.227]  And...
[01:22:54.995 --> 01:23:00.777]  If we had churches in this world, and if we had leaders in this world, we would never have gotten to this point.
[01:23:00.777 --> 01:23:21.165]  And, again, there's this really obscene, crazy thing about all this, where knowing how bad all this is makes it really hard for me to care about anything.
[01:23:21.165 --> 01:23:21.905]  Does that make sense?
[01:23:25.894 --> 01:23:27.656]  I mean, I don't care if I get fat.
[01:23:27.656 --> 01:23:30.158]  I don't care if my hair is falling out.
[01:23:30.158 --> 01:23:42.830]  I don't even, I mean, the stress I can take now is way worse than I used to take just because I'm now so accustomed to living under this lie and living under this enemy media and living under all these pedophile leftists.
[01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:48.516]  And I've just gotten to the point where I don't want to be around them anymore.
[01:23:48.516 --> 01:23:50.898]  And that means I don't want to look at Joe Biden.
[01:23:51.585 --> 01:23:53.586]  I don't want to look at Kamala Harris.
[01:23:53.586 --> 01:23:55.206]  I don't want to look at Boris Johnson.
[01:23:55.206 --> 01:24:00.067]  I don't want to look at Macron and Merkel and all these people.
[01:24:00.067 --> 01:24:05.969]  I mean, I didn't know that we could produce so much fake garbage filth.
[01:24:05.969 --> 01:24:11.691]  And I didn't know that people would sit there and take it from these people.
[01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:18.012]  I got clip after clip of them announcing permanent martial law, IDs to leave your house, forced inoculations.
[01:24:18.012 --> 01:24:20.053]  I mean, this is just all over the top.
[01:24:22.188 --> 01:24:25.330]  And then, oh yeah!
[01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:39.479]  The ADL that's called for my arrest in the Southern Poverty Law Center is now, in everybody's text messages, I told you that, running it all, spying on you, and they're announcing they're not going to let you send messages that they don't agree with.
[01:24:39.479 --> 01:24:41.080]  I mean, just, it's ridiculous!
[01:24:42.057 --> 01:24:47.561]  And they're all like hunchbacked, ugly, weird, neurotic middle patients because that's who they are!
[01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:50.363]  A normal person would not want to read everybody's text messages!
[01:24:50.363 --> 01:24:55.086]  A normal person would not even imagine something like that!
[01:24:55.086 --> 01:25:02.692]  But these are people that came up with Rainbow Dildo Butt Monkey Man
[01:25:04.565 --> 01:25:17.133]  Well, I can't even show you an image of the children come to the library and sit in this lap, funded by the UK government, signed up to call it Drag Queen Story Time, some demon, you know, creature dressed like a clown.
[01:25:17.133 --> 01:25:23.878]  But now they've got fake breasts, a huge fake butt, vagina, and penis hanging down, and then women bring their children to them.
[01:25:23.878 --> 01:25:26.780]  I mean, that's what runs the thing.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:28.341]  That's what it is.
[01:25:28.341 --> 01:25:30.963]  It wants to tear you limb from limb.
[01:25:30.963 --> 01:25:32.624]  It is a psychotic predator.
[01:25:34.315 --> 01:25:39.683]  It is the gates of hell opened, demons released, they have their way with us, period.
[01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:42.988]  And we conjured it by our acquiescence.
[01:25:42.988 --> 01:25:45.332]  We opened the gates of hell.
[01:25:45.332 --> 01:25:47.655]  We turned Satan loose.
[01:25:47.655 --> 01:25:50.059]  And now, we're all gonna die.
[01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:56.292]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:57.052]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:57.812]  Trying to move quicker.
[01:25:57.812 --> 01:25:58.632]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:58.632 --> 01:25:59.072]  Welcome.
[01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:04.234]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:07.615]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:26:07.615 --> 01:26:14.057]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:26:14.057 --> 01:26:15.737]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:19.879]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:26:19.879 --> 01:26:21.319]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:26:21.619 --> 01:26:27.142]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:26:27.142 --> 01:26:29.543]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:26:29.543 --> 01:26:38.848]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:26:38.848 --> 01:26:44.270]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:45.811]  That's right where we're at brother.
[01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:51.758]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[01:26:51.758 --> 01:26:53.540]  Because God created this country.

[01:27:54.964 --> 01:27:58.767]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[01:27:58.767 --> 01:28:01.249]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[01:28:01.249 --> 01:28:06.113]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[01:28:06.113 --> 01:28:07.594]  This is an incredible formula.
[01:28:07.594 --> 01:28:09.015]  Everybody should be taking it.
[01:28:09.015 --> 01:28:12.018]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:28:12.018 --> 01:28:13.139]  It's an amazing product.
[01:28:13.139 --> 01:28:14.320]  It's our newest product.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.521]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[01:28:16.521 --> 01:28:17.602]  MFoneWorkstore.com.
[01:28:17.602 --> 01:28:19.144]  Then we have both types of X2.
[01:28:19.144 --> 01:28:22.426]  It's the exact same X2 as the model, but one has a spray cap.
[01:28:22.426 --> 01:28:23.207]  One has a dropper cap.
[01:28:23.467 --> 01:28:28.350]  For 60 and 40% off, depending on which one, they're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:36.055]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:28:36.055 --> 01:28:38.336]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:38.336 --> 01:28:46.681]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[01:28:46.681 --> 01:28:48.122]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:53.085]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:17.690]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:20.631]  The thrill is gone!
[01:29:20.631 --> 01:29:21.552]  The thrill is gone!
[01:29:21.552 --> 01:29:26.814]  The spell you put on me is gone!
[01:29:26.814 --> 01:29:27.815]  Let's listen to another song.
[01:29:33.912 --> 01:29:34.706]  The thrill is gone!
[01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:19.550]  The spell is over.
[01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:24.514]  Now, I know my mission.
[01:30:24.514 --> 01:30:28.517]  Make sure everybody knows.
[01:30:28.517 --> 01:30:30.198]  Every damn thing coming that's bad.
[01:30:30.198 --> 01:30:31.219]  You did it!
[01:30:31.219 --> 01:30:32.640]  Bill Gates.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.601]  You did it, Warren Buffett.
[01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:34.621]  You did it, Ted Turner.
[01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:35.962]  You did it.
[01:30:35.962 --> 01:30:36.603]  Richard Branson.
[01:30:38.579 --> 01:30:40.440]  You did it, Oprah Winfrey.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.941]  You did it, Prince Charles.
[01:30:41.941 --> 01:30:46.944]  His little punk son came out and said he'd populate the planet.
[01:30:46.944 --> 01:30:49.686]  How about we start with you?
[01:30:49.686 --> 01:30:52.648]  Oh, no, you selfish piece of crap.
[01:30:52.648 --> 01:30:55.630]  You ain't gonna line up and get rid of yourself.
[01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:58.612]  We're all supposed to do it because you're better than us, aren't you?
[01:30:58.612 --> 01:31:02.214]  You inbred mental patient.
[01:31:02.214 --> 01:31:02.655]  Guess what?
[01:31:02.655 --> 01:31:03.435]  The thrill is gone.
[01:31:03.435 --> 01:31:06.797]  The spell is gone.
[01:31:06.797 --> 01:31:07.438]  We're awake now.
[01:31:08.843 --> 01:31:15.909]  You're gonna pay.
[01:31:15.909 --> 01:31:18.452]  All right, let's get into it right now.
[01:31:18.452 --> 01:31:21.074]  The guys dug up something really amazing.
[01:31:21.074 --> 01:31:22.335]  Rob, one of the producers, did.
[01:31:22.335 --> 01:31:25.218]  Not Rob Dew.
[01:31:25.218 --> 01:31:27.520]  The other great Rob.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.742]  And it's powerful.
[01:31:30.742 --> 01:31:31.763]  That's a whole other story.
[01:31:31.763 --> 01:31:33.285]  It's on Band.Video.
[01:31:33.285 --> 01:31:35.767]  And after I give the number out and take some of your calls, we'll get to it.
[01:31:37.102 --> 01:31:41.625]  But Chris Carter is a listener, and Chris Carter said some nice things about us.
[01:31:41.625 --> 01:31:44.086]  We've talked to Chris a little bit.
[01:31:44.086 --> 01:31:51.831]  And Chris admitted the CIA came to him and told him what to say in a lot of these episodes.
[01:31:51.831 --> 01:31:53.071]  He wasn't sure why.
[01:31:53.071 --> 01:31:55.173]  He was asking me why.
[01:31:55.173 --> 01:32:03.858]  But it says, uh, predictive programming, injection with spike protein, used to destroy people's immune systems,
[01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:08.361]  And slowly kill them with a soft kill weapon.
[01:32:08.361 --> 01:32:21.469]  1994, November 11th episode.
[01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:26.112]  Why would the CIA want that out then?
[01:32:26.112 --> 01:32:26.672]  When they're doing it?
[01:32:26.672 --> 01:32:29.074]  28 years later?
[01:32:29.074 --> 01:32:29.514]  27 years later?
[01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:48.405]  That's a big question, isn't it?
[01:32:48.405 --> 01:33:06.393]  Because there's a galactic rule that they gotta post in the newspaper or on TV, in a public place, they gotta write it on the wall, like in Ezekiel, she's the hand writing on the wall, what's gonna be done so you've got a chance to change your future.
[01:33:07.614 --> 01:33:24.109]  Like, when you're going to condemn a building, or when you're going to take somebody's property that they had to pay property taxes on, you've got to, for a year or longer, depending on local law, run an ad every month saying, I'm going to take this property!
[01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:27.832]  And I've been told, just like Chris Carter, I think, figured it out.
[01:33:27.832 --> 01:33:32.976]  He's one of the only people in Hollywood defending me when I got the platform three years ago.
[01:33:32.976 --> 01:33:33.537]  It was Chris Carter.
[01:33:34.994 --> 01:33:36.614]  He said, Alex Jones isn't a racist.
[01:33:36.614 --> 01:33:37.755]  He's a good man.
[01:33:37.755 --> 01:33:39.315]  He cares about humanity.
[01:33:39.315 --> 01:33:40.875]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:46.216]  That was a Hollywood reporter, if I remember correctly.
[01:33:46.216 --> 01:34:02.960]  But see, Chris heard me many, many years ago explain why the CIA came to him and why they planted the lone gunman episodes on him, where the government hijacks a jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Osama bin Laden.
[01:34:06.377 --> 01:34:11.178]  And trigger the war on terror, which would later be used against the American people.
[01:34:36.934 --> 01:34:39.015]  Well, now you know, Chris.
[01:34:39.015 --> 01:34:40.196]  But I think you're a smart guy.
[01:34:40.196 --> 01:34:42.638]  I think you already knew that, didn't you, Chris?
[01:34:42.638 --> 01:34:46.480]  Hell, let's go to the clip now, because I'm going to hit the Tucker Carlson thing on your calls next segment.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.964]  The toll-free number to join us on any subject you'd like, as long as you are a first-time caller today.
[01:34:52.964 --> 01:34:53.965]  That's first-time callers.
[01:34:53.965 --> 01:35:01.149]  And as long as you got a good telephone, any of these news items, anything you want to discuss, it's open season.
[01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.990]  It's free speech.
[01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.930]  It's a real
[01:35:04.841 --> 01:35:07.304]  Rare thing in these days that's left, but it's still here.
[01:35:07.304 --> 01:35:07.364]  877-789-2539.
[01:35:07.364 --> 01:35:08.245]  877-789-Alex.
[01:35:08.245 --> 01:35:08.325]  877-789-2539.
[01:35:08.325 --> 01:35:10.647]  But here's the X-Files program from November 11th, 1994 on Spike Proteins.
[01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:33.870]  Sir.
[01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:35.351]  Sir, you can't go in there!
[01:35:35.351 --> 01:35:36.211]  He's almost ready.
[01:35:36.211 --> 01:35:37.572]  What would you recommend?
[01:35:37.572 --> 01:35:38.212]  He brought her here.
[01:35:58.539 --> 01:36:01.780]  How did she get here?
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:05.301]  How did she get here?
[01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:06.361]  Is that Mayor Wetzel?
[01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:06.981]  Is that Daly?
[01:36:06.981 --> 01:36:08.402]  Are you Dr. Daly?
[01:36:08.402 --> 01:36:09.362]  What the hell is going on?
[01:36:09.362 --> 01:36:10.682]  How did she get here?
[01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:13.443]  Was it paramedics, FBI, military?
[01:36:13.443 --> 01:36:14.723]  Answer me right now!
[01:36:14.723 --> 01:36:17.524]  What, you're telling me she just appeared?
[01:36:17.524 --> 01:36:19.485]  Who did this to her?
[01:36:19.485 --> 01:36:20.805]  I want to see her admission forms.
[01:36:20.805 --> 01:36:21.725]  Who did this to her?
[01:36:21.725 --> 01:36:23.526]  I want to see what the rest of them have done.
[01:36:23.526 --> 01:36:24.626]  Listen, if you're with them,
[01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:28.427]  If you're hiding anything, I swear I will do anything!
[01:36:28.427 --> 01:36:31.987]  Whatever it takes, I'll find out what they did to her!
[01:36:31.987 --> 01:36:35.768]  She can't breathe despite protein.
[01:36:35.768 --> 01:36:41.209]  Oh, leprosy!
[01:36:54.494 --> 01:36:58.376]  This is weird.
[01:36:58.376 --> 01:36:59.677]  Good work sneaking out these charts.
[01:36:59.677 --> 01:37:01.037]  Stuck them in my pants.
[01:37:01.037 --> 01:37:04.559]  There's plenty of room down there.
[01:37:04.559 --> 01:37:06.020]  You look down, Mulder.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.401]  Tell you what, you're welcome to come over Saturday night.
[01:37:08.401 --> 01:37:11.543]  We're all hopping on the internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of Earth 2.
[01:37:11.543 --> 01:37:13.904]  I'm doing my laundry.
[01:37:13.904 --> 01:37:16.325]  The chart shows abnormal protein chains in the blood.
[01:37:16.325 --> 01:37:19.867]  The amino acid sequence is in a combination I've never seen before.
[01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.388]  I downloaded Scully's medical data to the newest Sloan gunman.
[01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:24.991]  He goes by the name The Thinker.
[01:37:24.991 --> 01:37:30.513]  This guy's a hacking genius.
[01:37:30.513 --> 01:37:31.714]  What?
[01:37:31.714 --> 01:37:36.236]  The Thinker reports the protein chains are the byproducts of branched DNA.
[01:37:36.236 --> 01:37:37.837]  Branched DNA?
[01:37:37.837 --> 01:37:39.657]  The cutting edge of genetic engineering.
[01:37:39.657 --> 01:37:42.579]  A biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.
[01:37:42.579 --> 01:37:44.680]  This is way beyond cutting edge.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.081]  This is technology 50 years down the line.
[01:37:47.081 --> 01:37:47.761]  What's it used for?
[01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:50.430]  Could be a tracking system.
[01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:52.752]  Developmental stages of a biological marker.
[01:37:52.752 --> 01:37:55.014]  You mean a high-tech identity card?
[01:37:55.014 --> 01:38:00.218]  Or something as insidious as grafting a human to something inhuman.
[01:38:00.218 --> 01:38:02.700]  Good theories, gentlemen, but all for naught.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.581]  This branch DNA is inactive.
[01:38:04.581 --> 01:38:05.942]  It's waste product.
[01:38:05.942 --> 01:38:08.304]  Whoever was experimenting on Skelly is finished.
[01:38:08.304 --> 01:38:12.587]  Now it's nothing more than a biological poison.
[01:38:12.587 --> 01:38:13.128]  Will she live?
[01:38:18.795 --> 01:38:23.796]  Um, her immune system has been decimated.
[01:38:23.796 --> 01:38:30.518]  And, uh, I doubt even a healthy human body has the ability to fight this.
[01:38:30.518 --> 01:38:35.859]  Mulder, there's nothing you can do.
[01:38:35.859 --> 01:38:40.420]  And now more people are dying from the COVID vaccine.
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:40.980]  It's official.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.380]  We'll show them when we come back.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.481]  And from the supposed virus.
[01:38:45.365 --> 01:38:50.415]  But see, they know Stockholm Syndrome, you won't be able to admit the horror to yourself, so you'll let them kill you.
[01:38:50.415 --> 01:38:51.698]  That's what Fauci's hoping.
[01:38:53.906 --> 01:38:57.289]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[01:38:57.289 --> 01:39:00.072]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[01:39:00.072 --> 01:39:02.954]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[01:39:02.954 --> 01:39:04.396]  You must have it to live.
[01:39:04.396 --> 01:39:08.579]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[01:39:08.579 --> 01:39:14.985]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[01:39:14.985 --> 01:39:16.006]  60% off on the spray top,
[01:39:16.706 --> 01:39:21.550]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:23.952]  I want to thank all the supporters that have got me some of the years.
[01:39:23.952 --> 01:39:24.832]  They're amazing.
[01:39:24.832 --> 01:39:27.034]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[01:39:27.034 --> 01:39:32.478]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[01:39:32.478 --> 01:39:34.820]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.982]  60 and 40 percent off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:39:39.982 --> 01:39:42.363]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[01:39:42.363 --> 01:39:43.943]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[01:39:43.943 --> 01:39:45.084]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:39:45.084 --> 01:39:57.969]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWarsTore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[01:39:57.969 --> 01:39:59.189]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:39:59.189 --> 01:40:00.009]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:40:00.009 --> 01:40:01.210]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:01.470]  Go ahead.
[01:40:03.431 --> 01:40:04.792]  I love your products.
[01:40:04.792 --> 01:40:15.499]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:40:15.499 --> 01:40:21.522]  But since taking Eurex II for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:40:21.522 --> 01:40:22.543]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:40:24.804 --> 01:40:32.528]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:40:32.528 --> 01:40:41.273]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:40:41.273 --> 01:40:42.093]  This is working.
[01:40:42.093 --> 01:40:43.094]  This is wonderful.
[01:40:43.094 --> 01:40:47.636]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[01:40:47.636 --> 01:40:52.279]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:40:55.342 --> 01:41:07.365]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[01:41:07.365 --> 01:41:14.447]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[01:41:14.447 --> 01:41:16.347]  Their first product they are launching is called
[01:41:16.667 --> 01:41:21.650]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:26.453]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[01:41:26.453 --> 01:41:28.414]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[01:41:28.414 --> 01:41:37.740]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:42.223]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[01:41:42.543 --> 01:41:46.690]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[01:41:46.690 --> 01:41:48.694]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[01:41:48.694 --> 01:41:52.861]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[01:41:52.861 --> 01:41:54.223]  TheBiopros.com.
[01:41:58.693 --> 01:41:59.974]  Jacob in Ohio.
[01:41:59.974 --> 01:42:00.354]  Welcome.
[01:42:00.354 --> 01:42:00.795]  Go ahead.
[01:42:00.795 --> 01:42:02.095]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:42:02.095 --> 01:42:02.676]  Good, bro.
[01:42:02.676 --> 01:42:03.757]  Great last caller.
[01:42:03.757 --> 01:42:06.819]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[01:42:06.819 --> 01:42:12.523]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[01:42:12.523 --> 01:42:14.684]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[01:42:14.684 --> 01:42:15.064]  All right.
[01:42:15.064 --> 01:42:16.325]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:42:16.325 --> 01:42:17.186]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[01:42:17.186 --> 01:42:17.346]  Go ahead.
[01:42:17.366 --> 01:42:19.167]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:19.167 --> 01:42:22.190]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:23.851]  The X-Tune does wonders.
[01:42:23.851 --> 01:42:24.992]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:42:24.992 --> 01:42:26.173]  You're on the fence about it.
[01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:26.974]  Get off the fence.
[01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:27.855]  Get the product.
[01:42:27.855 --> 01:42:29.036]  Support the info war.
[01:42:29.036 --> 01:42:30.357]  Tyler in Maine.
[01:42:30.357 --> 01:42:31.017]  You're on the air.
[01:42:31.017 --> 01:42:31.578]  Thanks for rolling.
[01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:32.138]  Go ahead.
[01:42:32.138 --> 01:42:33.639]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[01:42:33.639 --> 01:42:34.200]  It's an honor.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.141]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:42:36.141 --> 01:42:36.582]  Awesome.
[01:42:36.582 --> 01:42:42.046]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[01:42:42.046 --> 01:42:45.869]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[01:42:45.869 --> 01:42:47.490]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[01:42:47.490 --> 01:42:48.531]  Well, it definitely works.
[01:42:48.531 --> 01:42:50.172]  It's not a joke.
[01:42:50.172 --> 01:42:57.797]  Absolutely.
[01:42:57.797 --> 01:43:00.439]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:10.051 --> 01:43:17.835]  Alright, we're back live.
[01:43:17.835 --> 01:43:19.256]  Totally open phones next hour.
[01:43:19.256 --> 01:43:21.978]  We've already got phones loading up.
[01:43:21.978 --> 01:43:26.840]  So we're going to talk to Brian, Greg, James, Jake, John, Michael, Dave and others.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.603]  And listen, if I'm sounding dystopic, I'm trying to get folks to wake up and realize
[01:43:32.381 --> 01:43:33.282]  How much trouble we're in.
[01:43:33.282 --> 01:43:34.283]  They create a crisis.
[01:43:34.283 --> 01:43:35.604]  They oppose the saviors.
[01:43:35.604 --> 01:43:36.524]  They say, do what we say.
[01:43:36.524 --> 01:43:37.825]  The crisis will end.
[01:43:37.825 --> 01:43:39.426]  Then the crisis gets worse.
[01:43:39.426 --> 01:43:40.087]  More power.
[01:43:40.087 --> 01:43:42.309]  More control.
[01:43:42.309 --> 01:43:44.050]  You've got to reject the ruling class.
[01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.591]  You've got to reject everything they say.
[01:43:45.591 --> 01:43:48.313]  You've got to realize everything they push is poison and lies.
[01:43:48.313 --> 01:43:51.956]  And you've got to warn others.
[01:43:51.956 --> 01:43:53.817]  That's the only hope we've got.
[01:43:53.817 --> 01:44:01.163]  And the good news is, so many governors, so many legislators, people like Joe Rogan, people like Tucker Carlson,
[01:44:02.492 --> 01:44:05.555]  Are really waking up and getting hardcore.
[01:44:05.555 --> 01:44:18.065]  And I know it sounds crazy to come out and do a show on eugenics and depopulation that Fauci should be arrested, but that's what Fauci's done and that's now what Tucker Carlson's talking about.
[01:44:18.065 --> 01:44:23.929]  And so yeah, that's our job, was to say things that were unpopular because they were true.
[01:44:23.929 --> 01:44:26.912]  And these are scary things.
[01:44:26.912 --> 01:44:29.314]  I'm going to play part of the Tucker Carlson report from last night.
[01:44:29.314 --> 01:44:32.056]  He did 20 minutes on this, an incredible monologue.
[01:44:33.399 --> 01:44:37.721]  With how they're suppressing treatments while they run the censorship and how that's criminal?
[01:44:37.721 --> 01:44:38.421]  Yeah!
[01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:39.621]  They think they're above the law!
[01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:40.822]  They think they're safe!
[01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:42.182]  They think they can commit these crimes!
[01:44:42.182 --> 01:44:45.684]  We've got to wake up to their program and their conspiracy and say no to it!
[01:44:45.684 --> 01:44:52.726]  I just want to play something for Tucker Carlson, but first, again, I want to stay on air as long as possible.
[01:44:52.726 --> 01:44:56.048]  We sell products that are excellent that you need.
[01:44:56.048 --> 01:44:59.629]  We have the highest quality storable food, ready to ship to you,
[01:45:00.487 --> 01:45:03.789]  And InfoWarsTore.com for the biggest, best company in the U.S.
[01:45:03.789 --> 01:45:07.411]  With an additional 10% off, that sale will end next Sunday.
[01:45:07.411 --> 01:45:09.953]  There won't be a sale until November again.
[01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:16.096]  And food prices are going up everywhere to lock in high-quality food right now and beat inflation.
[01:45:16.096 --> 01:45:17.937]  Hundreds of reviews, 97%, 4.8 stars, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:18.318]  Continuing.
[01:45:23.268 --> 01:45:26.871]  We have the new Organics Green Fiber Total Amino Acid Supercharger.
[01:45:26.871 --> 01:45:31.756]  This isn't from cruddy greens that just still give you roughage and are good but not excellent.
[01:45:31.756 --> 01:45:49.231]  This is from all these other sprouts like wheat sprouts and alfalfa and everything else that has all the power of that little seed in it while it's sprouting to give you these antioxidants and all these vitamins and minerals and all 18 of the amino acids, 8 of which are essential.
[01:45:49.231 --> 01:45:50.192]  A, B, C, E.
[01:45:51.315 --> 01:45:56.800]  Amino acids, calcium, magnesium, iron, niacin, phosphorus, potassium.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.621]  This is really a powerful formula.
[01:45:58.621 --> 01:45:59.062]  It's $19.95.
[01:45:59.062 --> 01:46:00.883]  No reviews yet.
[01:46:00.883 --> 01:46:06.327]  It just came out yesterday, but it is a high-end clone of one of the best-selling products in the country that normally sells for $30.
[01:46:06.327 --> 01:46:10.511]  On store shelves, this is $19.95.
[01:46:10.511 --> 01:46:15.775]  I could have put out a formula that was still decent for one-eighth the cost, but this has a lot of product in it.
[01:46:15.775 --> 01:46:16.896]  We're very proud of it.
[01:46:16.896 --> 01:46:19.078]  And we've got X2, a deep-earth crystal good iodine.
[01:46:20.484 --> 01:46:24.066]  For 60% off right now, but it is going to sell out.
[01:46:24.066 --> 01:46:25.967]  I'm going to sell that until it sells out.
[01:46:25.967 --> 01:46:27.408]  And more comes in, hopefully, in a few months.
[01:46:27.408 --> 01:46:28.808]  We've got to fund our operation.
[01:46:28.808 --> 01:46:30.269]  So get off the fence about iodine.
[01:46:30.269 --> 01:46:31.910]  Discover the iodine conspiracy.
[01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:33.631]  Discover what Big Brother doesn't want you to know about.
[01:46:33.631 --> 01:46:37.713]  And fund the InfoWar with InfoWar's Iodine Challenge Blowout Special.
[01:46:37.713 --> 01:46:38.934]  It says 40% off.
[01:46:38.934 --> 01:46:46.878]  We might want to put on the ad that it's 60% off of the spray bottle cap, which is the same bottle, same amount, everything.
[01:46:46.878 --> 01:46:47.318]  It's 40% to 60% off.
[01:46:49.693 --> 01:46:50.433]  They said, what do you want to do?
[01:46:50.433 --> 01:46:55.657]  And I said, well, whatever we got less of, we'll say $40.
[01:46:55.657 --> 01:46:57.718]  And then whatever we have more of, we'll say $60.
[01:46:57.718 --> 01:46:59.879]  But it's the same bottle, the same everything.
[01:46:59.879 --> 01:47:01.100]  It's a different cap.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.221]  The spray bottle's the best deal.
[01:47:03.221 --> 01:47:04.882]  But it's going to sell out, too.
[01:47:04.882 --> 01:47:06.763]  So, yeah, $12.
[01:47:06.763 --> 01:47:08.905]  That's almost at cost.
[01:47:08.905 --> 01:47:10.265]  But I just want to get it out there.
[01:47:10.265 --> 01:47:11.046]  It's a lost leader.
[01:47:11.046 --> 01:47:11.726]  4.8 stars.
[01:47:11.726 --> 01:47:14.288]  Look at all those reviews.
[01:47:14.288 --> 01:47:14.948]  Info or store.
[01:47:14.948 --> 01:47:16.269]  Okay, I'm done talking about it.
[01:47:16.269 --> 01:47:17.730]  Let's go to Tucker Carlson last night.
[01:47:19.452 --> 01:47:26.497]  On the text messages that Big Brother, the political party, not just the NSA.
[01:47:26.497 --> 01:47:31.081]  God, imagine if the NSA was going to say, we're going to read all your text messages.
[01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:32.182]  They'd all be arrested.
[01:47:32.182 --> 01:47:37.686]  But oh, the DNC, through Big Tech, in that partnership says, oh yeah, it's totally normal.
[01:47:37.686 --> 01:47:39.607]  You already put up with censorship and everything else.
[01:47:39.607 --> 01:47:42.830]  We're reading your text messages, and now we want to censor them in live time.
[01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:43.170]  Here it is.
[01:47:43.837 --> 01:47:58.861]  Last March, as the first big clusters of coronavirus cases started to appear in this country, media executives in Silicon Valley coordinated with officials in Washington to determine how much the public would be allowed to know about the growing epidemic that was killing them.
[01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:07.284]  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook emailed Tony Fauci to NIH to assure him that Facebook users would only see Tony Fauci's approved guidance on COVID-19.
[01:48:08.368 --> 01:48:10.090]  Twitter and Google did effectively the same.
[01:48:10.090 --> 01:48:15.635]  Twitter and Google eliminated any post that deviated from Washington's official line.
[01:48:15.635 --> 01:48:25.464]  In many cases, they censored information from frontline physicians that was both medically sound, it was the science, and potentially life-saving.
[01:48:25.464 --> 01:48:27.946]  Posts about treatments, for example, were downplayed.
[01:48:28.931 --> 01:48:30.232]  They never apologize for this.
[01:48:30.232 --> 01:48:31.752]  They probably never will.
[01:48:31.752 --> 01:48:33.273]  Historians will assess it.
[01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:38.875]  They will likely record the early days of COVID-19 as a turning point in our society.
[01:48:38.875 --> 01:48:46.619]  An unprecedented assault on our most basic civil liberties that somehow very few people seem to notice when it first started happening.
[01:48:46.619 --> 01:48:51.421]  The usual stooges and think tank libertarians assured us at the time that none of this was a big deal.
[01:48:51.421 --> 01:48:55.583]  Soulless multinational media monopolies censoring essential medical information?
[01:48:55.583 --> 01:48:56.663]  No problem!
[01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.084]  That's how the free market works!
[01:48:58.723 --> 01:49:00.304]  Build your own Google if you don't like it.
[01:49:00.304 --> 01:49:02.466]  Start your own NIH.
[01:49:02.466 --> 01:49:05.007]  And in any case, in private, you can still say what you want.
[01:49:05.007 --> 01:49:06.148]  You're still free.
[01:49:06.148 --> 01:49:08.009]  It's not like this is North Korea.
[01:49:08.009 --> 01:49:10.191]  So calm down, conspiracy nut.
[01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:12.713]  You're starting to sound like Alex Jones.
[01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:13.953]  Most of us obeyed.
[01:49:13.953 --> 01:49:17.036]  We dutifully calmed down and went back to Netflix.
[01:49:17.036 --> 01:49:18.577]  We shouldn't have.
[01:49:18.577 --> 01:49:25.261]  Today we learned the Biden administration considers censorship applicable to private speech as well.
[01:49:25.261 --> 01:49:27.903]  What you say in private, when you're alone with your phone,
[01:49:28.621 --> 01:49:38.350]  You won't be able to say or read what you want because the DNC plans to control, and apparently they have the ability to control, the flow of information that you receive on your phone.
[01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:43.154]  Nothing that questions official regime policy will reach you.
[01:49:43.154 --> 01:49:47.098]  According to a report in Politico, and believe it or not we are quoting it here directly,
[01:49:47.802 --> 01:50:02.474]  Biden-allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers, text carriers, to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text message.
[01:50:02.474 --> 01:50:07.558]  Now, we're going to say that again because it is a sentence we never thought we would see written in English.
[01:50:07.558 --> 01:50:16.626]  The DNC is planning to censor any, quote, misinformation about vaccines that you receive privately over text message.
[01:50:17.893 --> 01:50:19.975]  So what does misinformation mean?
[01:50:19.975 --> 01:50:21.676]  Here's the thing you should know.
[01:50:21.676 --> 01:50:28.982]  Misinformation is not the same as false information, as factually inaccurate information.
[01:50:28.982 --> 01:50:31.904]  Misinformation can be factually true.
[01:50:31.904 --> 01:50:35.967]  In fact, it very often is factually true, and that's why they're angry about it.
[01:50:35.967 --> 01:50:46.976]  Misinformation is instead anything the Biden administration does not want you to know, including, for example, how effective the COVID vaccines actually are and what the potential side effects might be from taking them.
[01:50:47.876 --> 01:50:53.518]  So let's say you're interested to find out that information and you looked it up from the Biden administration's own websites.
[01:50:53.518 --> 01:50:57.300]  Let's say you start with the VAERS database, which records vaccine harm.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:05.583]  You no longer are allowed to text what you find on their databases to other people in this country, the country you were born in.
[01:51:05.583 --> 01:51:10.865]  Your private conversations will be controlled by the DNC.
[01:51:10.865 --> 01:51:12.286]  Is that the picture of a free country?
[01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:17.031]  Looks like we should have worried about civil liberties last year when all of this started.
[01:51:17.031 --> 01:51:18.652]  Oh, but it's a global health emergency.
[01:51:18.652 --> 01:51:19.553]  We have no choice.
[01:51:19.553 --> 01:51:22.175]  Things will go back to normal when it ends.
[01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:24.316]  But will they go back to normal?
[01:51:24.316 --> 01:51:30.820]  If the government can ban discussion of the drug they are making you take, what can't they do?
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.142]  And by the way, it's worth wondering, why are they doing this now?
[01:51:34.142 --> 01:51:39.345]  Why are they expanding censorship of conversation about the pandemic as the pandemic recedes?
[01:51:40.194 --> 01:51:42.576]  The COVID vaccines have been around for more than seven months.
[01:51:42.576 --> 01:51:45.918]  Pretty much everyone who wants one has had one.
[01:51:45.918 --> 01:51:47.479]  You can get the shot very easily.
[01:51:47.479 --> 01:51:49.340]  They're free.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:52.403]  According to the administration, this vaccine works perfectly.
[01:51:52.403 --> 01:51:55.024]  And that means that vaccinated people are protected from COVID.
[01:51:55.024 --> 01:51:55.665]  They're bulletproof.
[01:51:55.665 --> 01:51:56.725]  They can't get sick.
[01:51:56.725 --> 01:51:59.327]  That's why they took the vaccine in the first place.
[01:51:59.327 --> 01:52:04.531]  So why is official Washington so angry at the people who won't get vaccinated?
[01:52:04.531 --> 01:52:06.012]  How precisely do they pose a threat?
[01:52:07.418 --> 01:52:11.862]  It makes you think, once you think about it, that maybe none of this is really about COVID.
[01:52:11.862 --> 01:52:13.944]  Maybe it's about social control.
[01:52:13.944 --> 01:52:17.127]  Tony Fauci all but admitted that just the other day on television.
[01:52:17.127 --> 01:52:19.509]  Here's what he said.
[01:52:19.509 --> 01:52:30.880]  I know you've been very clear that the government isn't mandating vaccines, but do you think it's generally a good idea for businesses or schools to require vaccinations?
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:31.060]  Right.
[01:52:32.262 --> 01:52:42.325]  I have been of this opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates.
[01:52:42.325 --> 01:52:46.786]  I have been of the opinion there should be more mandates, but actually they didn't tell us that.
[01:52:46.786 --> 01:52:49.967]  Do you remember hearing that when they first told that the vaccine were for mandates?
[01:52:49.967 --> 01:52:50.687]  No.
[01:52:50.687 --> 01:52:52.987]  They said we're not for mandates, actually.
[01:52:52.987 --> 01:52:54.368]  But now they are.
[01:52:54.368 --> 01:52:56.708]  These drugs will be mandatory in many places they already are.
[01:52:56.708 --> 01:52:59.209]  If you want to get an education, for example, you've got to take one.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:05.022]  Many questions arise from this, deep questions about civil liberties and what it means to be a free country.
[01:53:05.022 --> 01:53:07.803]  But even on a medical level, questions arrive.
[01:53:07.803 --> 01:53:11.504]  For example, do we know enough to make these drugs mandatory?
[01:53:11.504 --> 01:53:19.707]  Just today, the Washington Post reports that the FDA is preparing to announce a new warning, and I believe has just announced tonight, for the J&J coronavirus.
[01:53:19.707 --> 01:53:23.189]  Alright, look, we're going to come back and play a little bit more of this, and I'm going right to your phone calls.
[01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:29.635]  Raymond, Bryant, Jake, John, Michael, Dave, and others.
[01:53:29.635 --> 01:53:32.418]  Our number three is straight ahead.
[01:53:32.418 --> 01:53:38.384]  And again, only recognizing this is 21st century war, and a corporate global takeover can beat it.
[01:53:38.384 --> 01:53:41.708]  That's why I keep harping how bad things are, because admitting it is how we win.
[01:53:43.781 --> 01:53:56.644]  So, we have free shipping, double Patriot points through this weekend, and our big loss leader is X2 in the dropper and in the spray bottle for 40 and 60 percent off, and your purchase funds the M4.
[01:53:56.644 --> 01:53:57.904]  But seriously, the U.N.
[01:53:57.904 --> 01:54:01.965]  admits two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[01:54:01.965 --> 01:54:03.746]  You need to experience it for yourself.
[01:54:03.746 --> 01:54:05.646]  Takes two weeks to a month to kick in.
[01:54:05.646 --> 01:54:06.887]  Try it and tell me what you think.
[01:54:06.887 --> 01:54:08.027]  You can't lose your fund on the M4.
[01:54:08.687 --> 01:54:21.696]  And again, I can harp on this all day, but just like our information is dead on from research, I'm telling you, I couldn't do what I do without Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and X2.
[01:54:21.696 --> 01:54:24.678]  Just in the stamina and mental focus area, it's incredible.
[01:54:25.178 --> 01:54:27.458]  What it did for libido is incredible.
[01:54:27.458 --> 01:54:29.479]  When I don't take it, I feel the difference.
[01:54:29.479 --> 01:54:31.379]  When I do take it, I'm so empowered.
[01:54:31.379 --> 01:54:32.819]  Get your Exu today.
[01:54:32.819 --> 01:54:36.380]  Discounted in the spray bottle and in the eyedropper bottle.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.841]  Take it under your tongue at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:54:38.841 --> 01:54:46.882]  The globalist hope you don't explore how incredibly powerful Deep Earth Crystal Iodine is.
[01:54:46.882 --> 01:54:50.283]  What are champions made of?
[01:54:50.283 --> 01:54:51.423]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:54:57.987 --> 01:55:00.628]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.

[01:55:02.368 --> 01:55:04.469]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:55:04.469 --> 01:55:06.389]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:55:06.389 --> 01:55:07.869]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:55:07.869 --> 01:55:09.230]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.

[01:55:31.255 --> 01:55:33.816]  888-233-33139 888-233-33139 888-233-33139 That's InfoWarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:56.892 --> 01:56:03.957]  Well, seein' in, as happy as a piggin', you know what?
[01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:09.780]  I hear people talkin' bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.362]  America's a racist, evil country, but North Korea's good.
[01:56:12.362 --> 01:56:16.845]  I've been on the war as we fight, drivin' about the way things ought to be.
[01:56:16.845 --> 01:56:19.146]  And I don't mind them switchin' sides.
[01:56:19.146 --> 01:56:24.650]  And I don't mind them switchin' sides and standin' up for things they believe in.
[01:56:25.965 --> 01:56:26.585]  Yeah!
[01:56:26.585 --> 01:56:27.546]  Runnin' down!
[01:56:27.546 --> 01:56:29.487]  You don't let it lead!
[01:56:29.487 --> 01:56:31.267]  I'm singin' a warning to ya!
[01:56:56.168 --> 01:56:58.030]  Oh, CNN.
[01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:03.134]  Oh, COVID-19 cases are surging in 45 states in one hot spot.
[01:57:03.134 --> 01:57:05.736]  Hospitalized patients are younger than ever, doctor says.
[01:57:05.736 --> 01:57:09.519]  Yeah, they got one probably crazy doctor there.
[01:57:09.519 --> 01:57:15.604]  And of course, you know, people that are vaccinated get really sick because they have an autoimmune response down to regular cold viruses, and that's their plan.
[01:57:15.604 --> 01:57:19.847]  And they're going to say all the new dead are new COVID viruses and new COVID variants.
[01:57:19.847 --> 01:57:22.249]  I told you that a year and a half ago, and it's happening now.
[01:57:23.507 --> 01:57:26.488]  Let's play a little bit more of what Tucker Carlson had to say, and we'll come back the next time.
[01:57:26.488 --> 01:57:28.389]  I'm going to write your calls.
[01:57:28.389 --> 01:57:38.613]  Today, the Washington Post reports that the FDA is preparing to announce a new warning, and I believe has just announced tonight, for the J&J coronavirus vaccine, Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
[01:57:38.613 --> 01:57:43.916]  They say it's been linked to a nerve disorder called GBS, which can cause paralysis, and has.
[01:57:43.916 --> 01:57:49.698]  Millions of people in this country alone have taken the Johnson & Johnson shot, but other vaccines could be implicated as well.
[01:57:50.439 --> 01:58:01.023]  According to the VAERS database, again maintained by the Biden administration, which tracks vaccine side effects, GBS has been reported as a potential symptom for every other COVID vaccine, too.
[01:58:01.023 --> 01:58:02.724]  That's not a small thing.
[01:58:02.724 --> 01:58:06.025]  And if it sounds familiar, then you must be over 40 and have a decent memory.
[01:58:06.025 --> 01:58:07.206]  Maybe you don't smoke a lot of weed.
[01:58:07.856 --> 01:58:16.782]  You may recall that in 1976 the federal government ended its mass vaccination program for influenza after several hundred people came down with GBS.
[01:58:16.782 --> 01:58:23.267]  People started asking questions and very quickly the Ford administration determined the vaccine was not worth the risk.
[01:58:23.267 --> 01:58:24.768]  But that's not happening now.
[01:58:24.768 --> 01:58:27.330]  People are not asking those questions because they can't.
[01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:29.031]  They're not allowed to in public.
[01:58:29.031 --> 01:58:35.456]  This is one of the only platforms in all American media that can operate outside the control of the tech monopolies and ask obvious questions.
[01:58:35.456 --> 01:58:36.756]  Not because we're against vaccines.
[01:58:36.756 --> 01:58:37.397]  We're certainly not.
[01:58:38.075 --> 01:58:42.218]  But because you have a right to know a lot before you take medicine.
[01:58:42.218 --> 01:58:45.240]  But Tony Fauci isn't stopping the vaccines in the US.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:52.065]  Instead, he's accusing anyone who has questions about the vaccine of having some kind of sinister political motivation.
[01:58:52.065 --> 01:58:53.006]  They must be QAnon.
[01:58:55.186 --> 01:59:02.607]  You know, Jake, it's an inexplicable pushing back on the part of some people about getting vaccinated.
[01:59:02.607 --> 01:59:10.329]  I mean, we've got to put aside this ideological difference or differences thinking that somebody's forcing you to do something.
[01:59:10.329 --> 01:59:14.929]  I really don't have a good explanation, Jake, about why this is happening.
[01:59:14.929 --> 01:59:18.830]  I mean, it's ideological rigidity, I think.
[01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:21.290]  There's no reason not to get vaccinated.
[01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:24.751]  Why are we having red states and places in the South
[01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:32.697]  That are very highly ideological in one way, not wanting to get vaccination.
[01:59:32.697 --> 01:59:36.641]  So Fauci on the one hand says, this should be mandatory.
[01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:38.362]  I want more mandates.
[01:59:38.362 --> 01:59:42.746]  And then moments later says, for some reason people think we're forcing this on them.
[01:59:42.746 --> 01:59:44.788]  And that's quote, inexplicable.
[01:59:44.788 --> 01:59:45.788]  They must be right wingers.
[01:59:45.788 --> 01:59:49.251]  You think if you're interviewing him, you would say, wait a second, didn't you just say it should be mandated?
[01:59:49.251 --> 01:59:50.913]  Maybe that's why they think it's mandated.
[01:59:50.913 --> 01:59:52.354]  Because you just said it was.
[01:59:54.167 --> 02:00:01.830]  But Fauci's claim that the resistance to the vaccine is somehow political is a bad faith attack posing as science.
[02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:03.431]  It's untrue.
[02:00:03.431 --> 02:00:11.114]  In fact, it has been the Democratic Party, very much Anthony Fauci's party, that has engaged in partisan discussion about the vaccine from the very first day.
[02:00:11.954 --> 02:00:18.860]  It wasn't even a year ago, it was September 2020, that Kamala Harris herself announced that the coronavirus vaccine might be dangerous.
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:19.060]  Why?
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.422]  Because Donald Trump oversaw its development.
[02:00:21.422 --> 02:00:26.507]  And this, Kamala Harris said, and we're quoting, is going to be an issue for all of us.
[02:00:26.507 --> 02:00:27.127]  Really?
[02:00:27.127 --> 02:00:30.350]  No longer an issue because Kamala Harris is now in charge.
[02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:37.056]  So now that she's in charge, anyone who asks any questions at all, totally nonpartisan questions, must be a white supremacist.
[02:00:37.794 --> 02:00:52.618]  Here's Dick Durbin of Illinois doing his best today to divide the country further along partisan lines, because that helps him, and tar anyone who wants more information about a specific drug as a lunatic who's against all vaccines.
[02:00:52.618 --> 02:00:56.379]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[02:00:56.379 --> 02:01:03.741]  First off, green fiber capsules, highest quality fiber you're going to find, with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[02:01:03.741 --> 02:01:05.222]  This is an incredible formula.
[02:01:05.222 --> 02:01:06.262]  Everybody should be taking it.
[02:01:06.642 --> 02:01:09.464]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:09.464 --> 02:01:10.765]  It's an amazing product.
[02:01:10.765 --> 02:01:11.946]  It's our newest product.
[02:01:11.946 --> 02:01:15.228]  It's 50% off out of the gates at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:01:15.228 --> 02:01:16.769]  Then we have both types of X2.
[02:01:16.769 --> 02:01:23.833]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap for 60 and 40% off, depending on which one.
[02:01:23.833 --> 02:01:25.995]  They're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:01:25.995 --> 02:01:32.519]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine.
[02:01:32.919 --> 02:01:33.680]  Conspiracy.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.961]  It's all available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:01:35.961 --> 02:01:44.306]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60 and 40% off.
[02:01:44.306 --> 02:01:45.747]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[02:01:45.747 --> 02:01:50.710]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:19.307]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:19.307 --> 02:02:28.753]  So, I don't say this to act like the show's powerful or the show's big, because what I'm doing is incredibly dangerous for myself and my family.
[02:02:29.799 --> 02:02:38.881]  But it's a responsibility I have, so I'm very proud to do it, and I'm glad I smelled this out 30 years ago, and got the position we're in now to try to resist it.
[02:02:38.881 --> 02:02:41.922]  But there's either one of two things.
[02:02:41.922 --> 02:02:56.686]  This is either all a simulation, and I'm some alien on a spaceship somewhere playing a video game where I'm a human on Earth, battling a depopulation program, and this is all virtual reality, and it seems incredibly real, and the video game lasts 47 years, and I'm about to die or whatever.
[02:02:58.061 --> 02:03:03.045]  I mean either, and a lot of big banker heads and a lot of big tech people think it's all a simulation.
[02:03:03.045 --> 02:03:10.930]  And there's articles about the head of Bank of America thinks it's all fake and dark matter is five times more powerful than the rest of matter.
[02:03:10.930 --> 02:03:17.455]  And so it's a majority view by techies that we're held in some alien simulation, this is all fake.
[02:03:17.455 --> 02:03:18.136]  So maybe
[02:03:19.304 --> 02:03:45.829]  No one's actually listening right now, and this is all an alien simulation, and in the simulation I'm the guy that knew about it, and I'm the guy that warned about it, and finally Joe Rogan's listening, and he's the big podcaster, and you know, I talk to him all the time, and oh, and then the other big top TV host is Tucker Carlson, and we're buddies, and we're battling the tyranny together, and oh, I got a call by this foreign president, and they're listening, and we're developing a plan to fight the New World Order, and
[02:03:48.010 --> 02:03:50.712]  And I'm like, OK, is this a simulation?
[02:03:50.712 --> 02:03:52.674]  Because that would be a lot better.
[02:03:52.674 --> 02:03:54.775]  We're not killing everybody in Africa.
[02:03:54.775 --> 02:03:57.437]  Henry Kissinger's not real.
[02:03:57.437 --> 02:03:59.399]  Prince Philip's not real.
[02:03:59.399 --> 02:04:00.500]  And it's all a simulation.
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.942]  And that means my mother's not real.
[02:04:02.942 --> 02:04:04.243]  My dad's not real.
[02:04:04.243 --> 02:04:05.284]  My four children aren't real.
[02:04:05.284 --> 02:04:08.266]  My wife's not real.
[02:04:08.266 --> 02:04:09.867]  My crew isn't real.
[02:04:09.867 --> 02:04:12.069]  John over there running the boom is not real.
[02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:15.392]  But John, you're real, aren't you, John?
[02:04:15.392 --> 02:04:16.312]  John thinks he's real.
[02:04:16.312 --> 02:04:17.073]  John thinks he's real.
[02:04:18.832 --> 02:04:20.453]  My grandma was real, dammit.
[02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:21.834]  My granddaddy was real.
[02:04:21.834 --> 02:04:24.917]  Because, let me tell you, can you imagine being Alex Jones?
[02:04:24.917 --> 02:04:32.223]  Like, I knew they were planning all this, and I saw them doing it, and now, now it's all happening, and I'm still on air!
[02:04:32.223 --> 02:04:39.769]  And I'm just wondering, with the Scientific American running headlines, confirm we live in a simulation,
[02:04:40.777 --> 02:04:44.300]  Or is that just a cop-out so people say, oh, I can't handle it, it's a simulation?
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:44.900]  No.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.361]  The third dimension's real.
[02:04:46.361 --> 02:04:47.162]  The planet's real.
[02:04:47.162 --> 02:04:55.088]  God made this as a genetic, real-world, real-life simulation.
[02:04:55.088 --> 02:05:07.118]  One of my dad's older cousins was a big guy in Vietnam and we would go to family reunions and he had a leather jacket he wore one time and said,
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:15.645]  Southeast Asia War Games 1964-1973 or whatever it was, second place.
[02:05:15.645 --> 02:05:23.329]  So even those guys like joke that that was all just a simulation or all a big joke, like the comedian or whatever would tell you.
[02:05:23.329 --> 02:05:25.411]  But look, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[02:05:25.411 --> 02:05:27.392]  Honestly, this is not a simulation.
[02:05:27.392 --> 02:05:33.736]  Brett and Cokie and Ramon and Brian and Jake and John and Michael and Dave, you're all real.
[02:05:34.671 --> 02:05:45.074]  So we're really living on a real planet in the universe with globalist world government trying to depopulate us right now and lying to us everywhere, and this is all a big test.
[02:05:45.074 --> 02:05:46.815]  So this is not a simulation.
[02:05:46.815 --> 02:05:48.816]  So it's real.
[02:05:48.816 --> 02:05:50.716]  But it's a little bit strange.
[02:05:50.716 --> 02:05:52.757]  So who's up first here?
[02:05:52.757 --> 02:05:55.318]  Who has been holding longest?
[02:05:55.318 --> 02:06:02.220]  That would be Dave in the great state of what's left of it, Democrat-occupied Texas.
[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:02.980]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[02:06:04.972 --> 02:06:17.359]  Hey Alex, this is Dave, and I just wanted to talk about the stuff that Harrison was talking about this morning, the riots that are going on with Zuma supporters in South Africa.
[02:06:17.359 --> 02:06:23.462]  And Harrison was saying that that's what we're going to be looking like in five to ten years.
[02:06:23.462 --> 02:06:29.245]  And I just wanted to say, is that something that you agree with?
[02:06:29.245 --> 02:06:29.726]  Absolutely.
[02:06:29.726 --> 02:06:32.007]  The globalists are collapsing the world economy.
[02:06:33.007 --> 02:06:43.735]  They're stealing all the wealth and they want to make the final collapse racial to blame economic collapse on black versus white crime, white versus black crime, and that clash.
[02:06:43.735 --> 02:06:57.846]  So definitely, they want to hide the global collapse between a racial, cultural crisis so that it's not class warfare, realizing the globalists instituted a worldwide lockdown that now led to this chain reaction of a cutoff of resources.
[02:06:58.562 --> 02:07:06.628]  So the globalists are exercising their will to collapse the world economy to decrease world population and consolidate power.
[02:07:06.628 --> 02:07:25.323]  Yeah, but what we got going on in South Africa is Jacob Zub, his supporters are upset that he's going off to jail and so the allegory or the way you would lay that on us would be Trump supporters then, you know, looting and rioting in five to ten years when Trump goes to jail because of
[02:07:27.202 --> 02:07:31.643]  What he's got going on with his business and whatnot.
[02:07:31.643 --> 02:07:32.423]  Well, you're right.
[02:07:32.423 --> 02:07:37.944]  They're rioting there because they're mad that the former president got arrested.
[02:07:37.944 --> 02:07:40.965]  But there's already all the crises.
[02:07:40.965 --> 02:07:46.486]  It's like Biden saying, oh, you rioted because of COVID-19 in Cuba.
[02:07:46.486 --> 02:07:50.247]  People rioted because there's not enough food there.
[02:07:50.247 --> 02:07:52.267]  So, I mean, listen, here's the deal.
[02:07:52.267 --> 02:07:55.648]  I don't deal in a bunch of esoteric riddles and things like that.
[02:07:56.514 --> 02:07:57.615]  Harrison does his show.
[02:07:57.615 --> 02:07:58.375]  He's got his views.
[02:07:58.375 --> 02:07:59.596]  I've got my views.
[02:07:59.596 --> 02:08:04.558]  You're going to have world destabilization accelerate as there's lack of food.
[02:08:04.558 --> 02:08:06.039]  And that's a fact.
[02:08:06.039 --> 02:08:12.962]  And the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group and the Davos Group did all this to create a worldwide collapse in their own words.
[02:08:12.962 --> 02:08:15.864]  So that's the big main issue.
[02:08:15.864 --> 02:08:20.246]  Certainly, there's going to be exacerbating triggers in the regions that then
[02:08:21.101 --> 02:08:23.642]  Again, trigger that or detonate that.
[02:08:23.642 --> 02:08:29.184]  But instead of making it about Harrison Smith, tell me your view about this.
[02:08:29.184 --> 02:08:38.907]  My view is that it's all a load of hooey, and everything that you guys push is nothing but nonsense.
[02:08:38.907 --> 02:08:41.128]  You take whatever is true and factual
[02:08:44.171 --> 02:08:45.951]  And you just turn it on its head.
[02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:49.272]  I mean, in March of last year... Well, let's stop.
[02:08:49.272 --> 02:08:50.292]  You called in.
[02:08:50.292 --> 02:08:52.052]  You called in, Dave.
[02:08:52.052 --> 02:08:54.553]  And you're just the first guy to call in, so I went to you first.
[02:08:54.553 --> 02:08:56.573]  You're a real caller, right?
[02:08:56.573 --> 02:08:57.853]  Yeah, I'm a real caller.
[02:08:57.853 --> 02:08:59.014]  Okay, nobody censored you.
[02:08:59.014 --> 02:09:00.614]  You're on air.
[02:09:00.614 --> 02:09:02.734]  I've not... I mean, I watch Harrison a couple days a week.
[02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.114]  I'm usually busy in the morning.
[02:09:04.114 --> 02:09:07.015]  I watch Owen a couple days a week, but I'm busy afternoon.
[02:09:07.015 --> 02:09:08.155]  I think they're good guys.
[02:09:08.155 --> 02:09:09.315]  I think they're funny and smart.
[02:09:09.315 --> 02:09:10.235]  They have a show.
[02:09:10.235 --> 02:09:13.676]  They don't agree with me on quite a few things, but I don't understand
[02:09:14.509 --> 02:09:15.831]  World destabilization.
[02:09:15.831 --> 02:09:20.457]  Listen, you know half the world spends about half their paycheck on food.
[02:09:20.457 --> 02:09:29.488]  So if you do a worldwide lockdown, and all the numbers and actuaries show, it'll cause massive civil unrest.
[02:09:29.488 --> 02:09:32.452]  And so you're saying we're talking about global destabilization.
[02:09:32.452 --> 02:09:33.333]  I know what you just said.
[02:09:33.957 --> 02:09:50.684]  In Africa, and not blaming people pissed about a president being arrested, a former president, you're saying it's about that instead of the economic hardship of a year and a half of lockdown, which was the total preparatory operation for it, which you're already seeing all over the planet.
[02:09:50.684 --> 02:09:58.067]  So, it's two different... Here's an analogy, and I'll let you get your point in, but listen to me.
[02:09:58.067 --> 02:10:03.249]  It's like the springtime in Texas or Kansas or Missouri or Oklahoma, and you got a
[02:10:04.312 --> 02:10:14.197]  Cold northern coming in with all that hot air out of the Gulf of Mexico and cold air and hot air hitting it causes a lot of violent turbulence and forms tornadoes.
[02:10:14.197 --> 02:10:23.382]  You're saying the tornadoes being caused by the arrest of the president, former president, that would be the hot air out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:27.203]  We're saying it's being caused by the cold air from the Arctic.
[02:10:27.203 --> 02:10:28.864]  We're both right.
[02:10:28.864 --> 02:10:32.326]  Can't people ever get two things in their mind at once or does that not make sense to you?
[02:10:33.490 --> 02:10:35.692]  Oh, it makes sense.
[02:10:35.692 --> 02:10:37.793]  It's still a bunch of hooey.
[02:10:37.793 --> 02:10:39.375]  Well, that's a fancy word.
[02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:41.897]  Is that a $3 word or a $5 word?
[02:10:41.897 --> 02:10:44.899]  That's not a big old, hey, a bunch of hooey.
[02:10:44.899 --> 02:10:46.600]  Oh, like we're going to have world IDs.
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:47.861]  We're going to have world government.
[02:10:47.861 --> 02:10:49.482]  We're going to have forced inoculations.
[02:10:49.482 --> 02:10:51.604]  They're going to release a virus to create lockdowns.
[02:10:51.604 --> 02:10:53.946]  Films I made 14 years ago.
[02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:59.850]  Oh, well, hey, someday I'll be as big as you and I won't be full of hooey, Dave.
[02:10:59.850 --> 02:11:00.551]  Dave, you stay there.
[02:11:00.551 --> 02:11:01.692]  I'm going to come back to Dave.
[02:11:01.692 --> 02:11:03.233]  Dave is not full of hooey.
[02:11:04.654 --> 02:11:10.999]  And so, we're going to let him speak three or four minutes on his side, as long as he doesn't say hooey again.
[02:11:10.999 --> 02:11:13.340]  He can't say the same phrase again.
[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:18.764]  Because he's got to actually back up what that defines.
[02:11:18.764 --> 02:11:22.827]  Hooey is a nice word for defecation, for feces, for crap.
[02:11:25.495 --> 02:11:31.620]  I do want to hear from you how I'm full of crap because my entire soul is turned towards truth.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:35.163]  And I know that I'm a rose colored darkly and I distort that truth.
[02:11:35.163 --> 02:11:37.905]  But there is no one trying to find truth more than me.
[02:11:37.905 --> 02:11:39.726]  So I want you to reprove me.
[02:11:39.726 --> 02:11:41.448]  I want you to edify me.
[02:11:41.448 --> 02:11:45.731]  I want you to baptize me in truth day when we return.
[02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.232]  I want you to complete me.
[02:11:47.232 --> 02:11:49.134]  I want you to sanctify me.
[02:11:51.932 --> 02:11:55.681]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:11:55.681 --> 02:11:59.410]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:11:59.410 --> 02:12:01.996]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:12:02.657 --> 02:12:07.021]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:12:07.021 --> 02:12:12.787]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:12:12.787 --> 02:12:24.399]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:12:25.019 --> 02:12:27.141]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:12:27.141 --> 02:12:31.265]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:12:31.265 --> 02:12:41.874]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:12:41.874 --> 02:12:51.422]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:12:51.422 --> 02:12:52.063]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:52.865 --> 02:12:56.248]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[02:12:56.248 --> 02:12:59.031]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[02:12:59.031 --> 02:13:01.913]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[02:13:01.913 --> 02:13:03.355]  You must have it to live.
[02:13:03.355 --> 02:13:07.538]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[02:13:07.538 --> 02:13:13.944]  We have X2 in two different bottles, the same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[02:13:13.944 --> 02:13:14.965]  60% off on the spray top.
[02:13:15.665 --> 02:13:20.510]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:22.912]  I want to thank all the supporters that have got me some of the years.
[02:13:22.912 --> 02:13:23.813]  They're amazing.
[02:13:23.813 --> 02:13:25.995]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[02:13:25.995 --> 02:13:31.440]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.782]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[02:13:34.582 --> 02:13:39.203]  60 and 40% off for a limited time because it's selling out right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:13:39.203 --> 02:13:41.364]  We're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[02:13:41.364 --> 02:13:42.904]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[02:13:42.904 --> 02:13:44.045]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:13:44.045 --> 02:13:54.607]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWareStore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[02:13:54.607 --> 02:13:57.308]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:06.414 --> 02:14:12.795]  So, last summer, we saw billions and billions and billions of dollars in damage.
[02:14:12.795 --> 02:14:18.277]  Thousands of businesses and homes burned down, all over the United States.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.543]  And this caller called in and used a magic word like alakazam or open sesame.
[02:14:36.543 --> 02:14:37.263]  He said, hooey.
[02:14:37.263 --> 02:14:39.044]  I said, well, give me your proof.
[02:14:39.044 --> 02:14:40.945]  Hooey!
[02:14:40.945 --> 02:14:42.266]  Like, sooo-wee!
[02:14:42.266 --> 02:14:43.346]  Come here, pig!
[02:14:43.346 --> 02:14:44.947]  You know, soo-wee, soo-wee.
[02:14:44.947 --> 02:14:46.648]  Soo-wee's Latin for pig.
[02:14:46.648 --> 02:14:47.329]  Here, pig!
[02:14:47.329 --> 02:14:48.389]  Here, pig!
[02:14:48.389 --> 02:14:49.590]  He used that magic word.
[02:14:49.590 --> 02:14:50.290]  I was like, oh!
[02:14:50.290 --> 02:14:51.051]  Like, oh!
[02:14:51.051 --> 02:14:53.232]  When he used that word, I like, fell on my knees.
[02:14:53.232 --> 02:14:58.515]  I knew that I'd reached an intellectual level that I'd never even imagined I'd seen the face of God!
[02:15:00.422 --> 02:15:04.623]  So, Harrison Smith, I didn't watch his show this morning, I caught a little bit of it, but I didn't catch the part he was talking about.
[02:15:04.623 --> 02:15:07.863]  He said, what you see in South Africa, culture war is coming here.
[02:15:07.863 --> 02:15:14.985]  Well, the left's certainly trying it, but we just saw looting and rioting last year, and still this year, in the United States.
[02:15:14.985 --> 02:15:22.726]  So, saying that what you saw in South Africa is coming here, I think you could actually say what we saw in America has gone to South Africa.
[02:15:22.726 --> 02:15:25.767]  So that sounds like some hooey from you in Texas there, Dave.
[02:15:27.085 --> 02:15:38.512]  Well, what I'm saying is facetious, that is coming out of InfoWars, is this whole bit about COVID in general.
[02:15:38.512 --> 02:15:48.097]  Yes, locking down everything has devastated businesses, devastated people, being alone at home.
[02:15:48.097 --> 02:15:52.660]  It hasn't devastated Big Tech and the Big Macs, they doubled and tripled the province!
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:54.541]  And they're the ones behind it!
[02:15:55.765 --> 02:16:05.575]  But if you cast your mind back to March of last year, when you and Adam were on the program saying, it's over for humanity.
[02:16:05.575 --> 02:16:08.978]  There will be nothing but lone survivor.
[02:16:08.978 --> 02:16:10.440]  That was your stance.
[02:16:11.164 --> 02:16:12.485]  Over a year ago.
[02:16:12.485 --> 02:16:13.686]  Nope, we gotta play the clip.
[02:16:13.686 --> 02:16:15.147]  That was not my stance.
[02:16:15.147 --> 02:16:16.389]  Mike Adams is a smart guy.
[02:16:16.389 --> 02:16:17.049]  Hold on a minute.
[02:16:17.049 --> 02:16:18.991]  You're not gonna make false statements here.
[02:16:18.991 --> 02:16:21.973]  Mike Adams was on Sunday and he said, I was right.
[02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.595]  The virus wasn't as bad as I said.
[02:16:23.595 --> 02:16:31.581]  I said they're gonna use the virus as a pretext for a global lockdown because I had Operation Lockstep from the Rockefellers about their plan.
[02:16:31.581 --> 02:16:32.402]  You're wrong again.
[02:16:33.658 --> 02:16:35.438]  The next step is bullshit.
[02:16:35.438 --> 02:16:36.138]  We can't cuss.
[02:16:36.138 --> 02:16:37.379]  Gotta let you go.
[02:16:37.379 --> 02:16:38.259]  Hey, listen.
[02:16:38.259 --> 02:16:40.219]  Here's the good part about the world.
[02:16:40.219 --> 02:16:43.960]  You don't have to listen to this show, alright?
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:50.481]  Where we told you ten years ago they're gonna take over your private text messages and censor them, which they now have announced.
[02:16:50.481 --> 02:16:54.902]  You don't have to tune into the lies of Alex Jones.
[02:16:54.902 --> 02:16:55.922]  Have I been wrong before?
[02:16:55.922 --> 02:16:56.442]  Absolutely.
[02:16:56.442 --> 02:17:01.043]  But that's a misrepresentation of what you said about what we said.
[02:17:01.043 --> 02:17:02.523]  Absolutely not true.
[02:17:02.523 --> 02:17:02.883]  There you go.
[02:17:04.850 --> 02:17:06.311]  That's just a little bit of counting coup there.
[02:17:06.311 --> 02:17:08.513]  That's a guy showing everybody how big he is.
[02:17:08.513 --> 02:17:09.935]  Which is great.
[02:17:09.935 --> 02:17:11.156]  I'm not against somebody disagreeing.
[02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:13.478]  A lot of times when people disagree, they're actually right about me.
[02:17:13.478 --> 02:17:17.402]  But that was not the case right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:17.402 --> 02:17:19.764]  Now we're not going to get to 15, 20 phone calls the rest of this hour.
[02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:22.026]  Paul wants to come up if I go that long with somebody.
[02:17:22.026 --> 02:17:24.128]  Let's talk to Koki in Illinois.
[02:17:24.128 --> 02:17:25.049]  You're on the air, Koki.
[02:17:25.049 --> 02:17:26.991]  Thanks for calling.
[02:17:26.991 --> 02:17:27.531]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:27.531 --> 02:17:30.033]  Just want to say thank you so much for everything you do, man.
[02:17:30.033 --> 02:17:30.554]  Thank you, brother.
[02:17:31.613 --> 02:17:48.939]  Alright, so, uh, there are some things that I disagree with you on, for sure, but it just amazes me how many people haven't read documents like Lockstep and things like that, and they are, you know, they're certain that everything you're saying is bullshit, and... You cussed again, brother.
[02:17:48.939 --> 02:17:51.520]  Listen, listen, I gotta let you go.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:57.061]  I'm gonna explain to everybody something right now, and I'm gonna just be real slow about this.
[02:17:57.061 --> 02:17:58.702]  We have a delay in there.
[02:18:00.382 --> 02:18:03.003]  That delays the show five minutes, okay?
[02:18:03.003 --> 02:18:05.305]  Not five minutes, five seconds.
[02:18:05.305 --> 02:18:13.009]  And once you cuss, we have to hit the delay button, because if you do it again, we're not going to catch it.
[02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:17.992]  So I've got to let you go when you call in when you cuss.
[02:18:17.992 --> 02:18:19.692]  The last guy cussed, I had to let him go.
[02:18:19.692 --> 02:18:22.814]  The next guy cussed, I got to let him go.
[02:18:22.814 --> 02:18:26.316]  And it's not because you're calling in disagreeing with me.
[02:18:26.316 --> 02:18:27.197]  That's entertaining.
[02:18:27.197 --> 02:18:27.977]  That's informative.
[02:18:28.562 --> 02:18:30.144]  Hell, I'm wrong about a lot of stuff.
[02:18:30.144 --> 02:18:32.106]  Please correct me.
[02:18:32.106 --> 02:18:36.290]  I'm on hundreds of radio stations.
[02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:38.012]  And CNN's allowed to cuss.
[02:18:38.012 --> 02:18:39.433]  FCC does nothing.
[02:18:39.433 --> 02:18:40.854]  MSNBC.
[02:18:40.854 --> 02:18:42.696]  We've had stations fined before.
[02:18:42.696 --> 02:18:42.716]  $4,000.
[02:18:42.716 --> 02:18:44.218]  The first fine is $4,000.
[02:18:48.951 --> 02:18:55.916]  For you cussing on air, don't do it anymore or your leftist calling in trying to get us in trouble.
[02:18:55.916 --> 02:18:57.677]  And maybe that's who the last two people were.
[02:18:57.677 --> 02:19:01.399]  I don't know that, but don't do it.
[02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:04.301]  Don't do it anymore to my show.
[02:19:04.301 --> 02:19:05.502]  Maybe I shouldn't take calls.
[02:19:05.502 --> 02:19:07.203]  Maybe you win.
[02:19:07.203 --> 02:19:10.866]  Maybe I'll just read some more diss info here.
[02:19:10.866 --> 02:19:11.306]  You know what?
[02:19:11.306 --> 02:19:14.208]  Just for those guys who want to shut my show down, I'm going to plug right now.
[02:19:14.208 --> 02:19:16.049]  We'll come back and I'm going to go to Brett
[02:19:16.698 --> 02:19:21.320]  Ramon, Brian, Jake, John, Michael, and others.
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:23.040]  And those guys don't frustrate me.
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:33.543]  It's just, I have you on the talk, and you can say it's wrong all day, but the Federal Communications Commission wants to shut us down.
[02:19:33.543 --> 02:19:42.346]  And leftists are listening to every radio station we're on, waiting to hear somebody say one of those six, seven deadly words.
[02:19:42.346 --> 02:19:43.767]  Which I think you've got a right to say.
[02:19:43.767 --> 02:19:44.507]  It doesn't shock me.
[02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:52.433]  You didn't have drag queen story time with a convicted pedophile with a full erection through panties, you know, rubbing up against kids on TV.
[02:19:52.433 --> 02:19:53.434]  And oh, that's liberal.
[02:19:53.434 --> 02:19:54.354]  Oh, that's great.
[02:19:54.354 --> 02:19:57.376]  Somebody says it's SH-T on air.
[02:19:57.376 --> 02:19:58.756]  My God, it's the end of the world.
[02:19:58.756 --> 02:20:00.177]  Alex Jones is the devil.
[02:20:00.177 --> 02:20:02.218]  Shut his radio stations down.
[02:20:02.218 --> 02:20:05.920]  But I'm not going to do that to our radio stations.
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.760]  Not going to do it.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.881]  You hung up on yourselves.
[02:20:10.914 --> 02:20:29.867]  And since you're trying to shut us down, I'm going to talk to our great listeners and our family of supporters and just say, I've got a lot of reporters and a lot of crew and a lot of people I'm trying to hire and I'm trying to get on board to expand what we're doing.
[02:20:29.867 --> 02:20:31.788]  And I can't do that without support.
[02:20:31.788 --> 02:20:35.290]  I can't stay on air without your support.
[02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:36.931]  And we've got products that are amazing.
[02:20:36.931 --> 02:20:40.574]  So get them at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:20:43.357 --> 02:20:50.180]  We have at 60% off, not 40% off like that ad says, which will probably never change, that's okay.
[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:57.382]  Because we're so sophisticated and so controlled and control our information and half of it's wrong.
[02:20:57.382 --> 02:20:59.243]  It's 40% off for the dropper bottle.
[02:20:59.243 --> 02:21:01.624]  It's 60% off for the spray bottle.
[02:21:01.624 --> 02:21:03.464]  That is basically at cost.
[02:21:03.464 --> 02:21:05.685]  I need the funds to run the operation.
[02:21:05.685 --> 02:21:08.986]  It's the good halogen your whole body runs off of.
[02:21:08.986 --> 02:21:11.607]  It's infowarestore.com.
[02:21:11.607 --> 02:21:12.928]  Or you can simply call toll free
[02:21:13.626 --> 02:21:16.547]  888-253-3139.
[02:21:16.547 --> 02:21:20.829]  And now we've got in stock green fiber capsules that are beyond fiber.
[02:21:20.829 --> 02:21:26.252]  They're really total amino acid supercharged systems.
[02:21:26.252 --> 02:21:31.074]  It's no secret that our unhealthy modern diets are slowly killing us.
[02:21:31.074 --> 02:21:38.057]  Most people are eating highly processed foods that are lacking high-quality antioxidants, vitamins, enzymes, and organic fiber.
[02:21:39.364 --> 02:21:42.967]  It's virtually impossible to maintain a perfect diet in our modern world.
[02:21:42.967 --> 02:21:53.116]  With the new Organic Greens Fiber Caps at InfoWareStore.com, we're making it easier than ever to take in organic greens and sprouts that are loaded with healthy fiber.
[02:21:53.116 --> 02:22:03.946]  Made with seven organic greens that contain natural enzymes for healthy digestion, this one serving of New Greens Fiber Caps, which are concentrated, contains as much as three cups of iceberg lettuce and fiber.
[02:22:03.946 --> 02:22:05.607]  But again, fiber is a side issue.
[02:22:05.607 --> 02:22:06.108]  Wheatgrass
[02:22:07.111 --> 02:22:10.273]  It's an excellent source of many different vitamins and minerals.
[02:22:10.273 --> 02:22:18.036]  Of its 17 amino acids, 8 are considered essential, meaning your body cannot produce them, and you must obtain them from food sources.
[02:22:18.036 --> 02:22:28.101]  Flax sprouts are excellent sources of antioxidants, vitamin A, B, C, E, and essential amino acids, calcium, magnesium, iron, niacin, phosphorus, and potassium.
[02:22:28.101 --> 02:22:31.663]  The formula has loaded with organic pea fiber.
[02:22:32.367 --> 02:22:38.969]  Organic alfalfa leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, and so much more.
[02:22:38.969 --> 02:22:45.431]  It's available out of the gates at mfulworthstore.com, 33% off, $19.95, and it funds our operation.
[02:22:45.431 --> 02:22:53.453]  Something that seminar libtard callers absolutely hate.
[02:22:53.453 --> 02:22:54.714]  Your voice counts.
[02:22:55.521 --> 02:23:00.585]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:23:00.585 --> 02:23:03.167]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:23:03.167 --> 02:23:04.668]  They know you're angry.
[02:23:04.668 --> 02:23:10.073]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.
[02:23:10.073 --> 02:23:19.300]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports,

[02:23:32.231 --> 02:23:32.891]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[02:23:52.638 --> 02:24:00.832]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:24:02.125 --> 02:24:06.866]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:24:06.866 --> 02:24:09.206]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:24:09.206 --> 02:24:18.068]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:24:18.068 --> 02:24:29.210]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:24:29.210 --> 02:24:29.430]  Yes.
[02:24:29.890 --> 02:24:34.815]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:24:34.815 --> 02:24:41.563]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:24:41.563 --> 02:24:42.784]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:24:42.784 --> 02:24:44.646]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:24:44.646 --> 02:24:47.469]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:49.331]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:24:51.992 --> 02:25:00.153]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:25:00.153 --> 02:25:08.915]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:25:08.915 --> 02:25:15.337]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:25:15.857 --> 02:25:17.379]  We finally got them back in stock.
[02:25:17.379 --> 02:25:18.500]  The highest rated.
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:21.664]  They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones.
[02:25:21.664 --> 02:25:24.527]  Get 50% off $14.95.
[02:25:24.527 --> 02:25:27.831]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[02:25:27.831 --> 02:25:30.053]  We've got a private label with InfoWars on them.
[02:25:31.034 --> 02:25:41.196]  For $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[02:25:41.196 --> 02:25:43.836]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[02:25:43.836 --> 02:25:49.077]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[02:25:49.077 --> 02:25:51.938]  They're 50% off right now at infowarestore.com.
[02:25:51.938 --> 02:25:58.899]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[02:25:59.483 --> 02:26:04.987]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[02:26:04.987 --> 02:26:12.854]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[02:26:12.854 --> 02:26:14.335]  Humanity is strong.
[02:26:14.335 --> 02:26:15.295]  We're incredible.
[02:26:15.295 --> 02:26:19.078]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[02:26:19.078 --> 02:26:21.540]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:27.485]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[02:26:27.865 --> 02:26:37.532]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[02:26:37.532 --> 02:26:39.853]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:26:39.853 --> 02:26:42.515]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[02:26:42.515 --> 02:26:47.839]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[02:26:47.839 --> 02:26:54.183]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[02:26:54.183 --> 02:26:56.805]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:07.046 --> 02:27:09.628]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:27:09.628 --> 02:27:12.130]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:15.113]  From Kauai, Hawaii to New York City.
[02:27:15.113 --> 02:27:19.096]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:21.458]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:27:21.458 --> 02:27:24.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:26.522]  Welcome, Dano.
[02:27:26.522 --> 02:27:28.063]  Alright, look, I got loaded phone lines.
[02:27:28.063 --> 02:27:30.445]  I'm not gonna spend ten minutes with each caller anymore.
[02:27:30.445 --> 02:27:32.567]  As they just go, oh, my cue's Alex or something.
[02:27:32.567 --> 02:27:35.309]  He'll just stay in a feedback loop with me until I cuss.
[02:27:36.167 --> 02:27:38.849]  So let's just go in the order your calls are received.
[02:27:38.849 --> 02:27:43.772]  Brett in South Dakota, then we'll speak to Jake in Arizona.
[02:27:43.772 --> 02:27:45.433]  Go ahead, Brett.
[02:27:45.433 --> 02:27:46.534]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:27:46.534 --> 02:27:46.914]  Good, brother.
[02:27:46.914 --> 02:27:48.315]  Good to talk to you.
[02:27:48.315 --> 02:27:49.716]  Hey, you too.
[02:27:49.716 --> 02:27:51.577]  So I wanted to call and basically
[02:27:52.367 --> 02:27:53.048]  Excuse me.
[02:27:53.048 --> 02:27:56.511]  It feels like we're no longer in a peaceful revolution.
[02:27:56.511 --> 02:27:58.312]  It feels like we're already in a violent revolution.
[02:27:58.312 --> 02:27:58.893]  I agree.
[02:27:58.893 --> 02:28:10.203]  They are assaulting us with deadly vaccines, with virus variants, with 5G, with BLM, with Antifa, with open borders, with demoralization, saying we're enemies.
[02:28:10.203 --> 02:28:11.444]  Yeah, we're in a war.
[02:28:11.444 --> 02:28:13.266]  America's under attack.
[02:28:13.266 --> 02:28:13.806]  Absolutely.
[02:28:13.806 --> 02:28:16.409]  And I mean, just because bullets aren't flying doesn't mean people aren't dying.
[02:28:16.409 --> 02:28:18.671]  I mean, so we are in a violent revolution already.
[02:28:19.218 --> 02:28:19.738]  You know what I mean?
[02:28:19.738 --> 02:28:26.703]  With the mainstream propaganda going around with all the misinformation that they're putting out, I mean, it's just absolutely absurd.
[02:28:26.703 --> 02:28:28.364]  I agree.
[02:28:28.364 --> 02:28:29.104]  So what do we do?
[02:28:29.104 --> 02:28:30.365]  He said it's coming to a head, brother.
[02:28:30.365 --> 02:28:31.746]  Tell us about it.
[02:28:31.746 --> 02:28:38.190]  Well, excuse me, I'm not sure how we go about it because we're still divided in our own ranks, too.
[02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:39.851]  We can't get along internally.
[02:28:39.851 --> 02:28:40.772]  It's crazy.
[02:28:40.772 --> 02:28:48.597]  I mean, you have some senators that say one thing, but they won't get behind other senators, you know, kind of like Ted Cruz won't get behind Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[02:28:49.048 --> 02:28:51.269]  I mean, we're on the same side here.
[02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:52.489]  We need to stop this.
[02:28:52.489 --> 02:28:59.190]  And they're the ones that need to really come together and say, hey, we want to live.
[02:28:59.190 --> 02:29:00.511]  We want humanity.
[02:29:00.511 --> 02:29:01.331]  And they're not doing it.
[02:29:01.331 --> 02:29:05.872]  And until that happens, I don't think there's really a lot more that we can do.
[02:29:05.872 --> 02:29:14.214]  I mean, we can keep pushing them, but it just doesn't feel like there's anything else that... Well, I told people a year ago they're going to have contact tracers come to your door and try to intimidate you.
[02:29:15.093 --> 02:29:18.835]  I mean, I told people they're going to say, oh, sorry, the vaccine doesn't work.
[02:29:18.835 --> 02:29:21.336]  You need booster shots because it was in all the white papers.
[02:29:21.336 --> 02:29:23.676]  Now it's happening.
[02:29:23.676 --> 02:29:25.937]  And so the question is, what do we do?
[02:29:25.937 --> 02:29:29.119]  It's all a planned out fraud.
[02:29:29.119 --> 02:29:34.020]  It is 100 percent, and I, you know, I guess we just keep fighting the best we can and.
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:40.303]  Keep going, I mean, I'm pushing over, I mean, I haven't really been politically active until about a year, year and a half ago.
[02:29:41.112 --> 02:29:41.732]  And I'm pushing.
[02:29:41.732 --> 02:29:48.756]  I mean, I'm going to be going to the Freedom Fest that we're having up here next week, which will be pretty good because James O'Keefe will be there.
[02:29:48.756 --> 02:29:57.280]  But I mean, we got to keep connecting and try and get those human connections and band together with everybody we possibly can.
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.541]  Well, my friend, God bless you.
[02:29:59.541 --> 02:30:00.622]  I appreciate your call.
[02:30:00.622 --> 02:30:01.462]  We have the footage.
[02:30:01.462 --> 02:30:04.484]  We'll air next segment of
[02:30:05.862 --> 02:30:10.884]  Contact tracers coming to your door in their mask, in their outfits, all in their theater.
[02:30:10.884 --> 02:30:12.684]  Like, oh, we don't know if you've had shots.
[02:30:12.684 --> 02:30:14.025]  Oh, we gotta wear a mask.
[02:30:14.025 --> 02:30:15.585]  It's all theater.
[02:30:15.585 --> 02:30:17.986]  It's all garbage.
[02:30:17.986 --> 02:30:21.407]  It's all the new medical police state is their excuse.
[02:30:21.407 --> 02:30:22.147]  And it's so dangerous.
[02:30:22.147 --> 02:30:23.588]  That's coming up next segment.
[02:30:23.588 --> 02:30:27.369]  But right now, let's air a short clip.
[02:30:27.369 --> 02:30:28.849]  This is a U.S.
[02:30:28.849 --> 02:30:33.171]  Senator, Durbin, having a Freudian slip today.
[02:30:33.171 --> 02:30:33.971]  This happened today.
[02:30:33.971 --> 02:30:34.311]  Here it is.
[02:30:35.564 --> 02:30:37.786]  Here's the reality.
[02:30:37.786 --> 02:30:41.269]  We have millions who have died across the world by this vaccine.
[02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:43.511]  We may never have an accurate count.
[02:30:43.511 --> 02:30:46.273]  We have hundreds of thousands who have died in the United States.
[02:30:47.842 --> 02:30:55.145]  Senator Dick Durbin reignites the debate about deaths and injuries caused by vaccines.
[02:30:55.145 --> 02:31:02.748]  The senator from Illinois delivered a speech Monday criticizing media outlets for highlighting reports of vaccine deaths.
[02:31:02.748 --> 02:31:06.550]  He suddenly stated millions of people died by this vaccine.
[02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:13.193]  According to the CDC's system that 9,200 Americans could have died from the vaccine so far.
[02:31:14.557 --> 02:31:16.398]  And about 1 in 40 they think is reported.
[02:31:16.398 --> 02:31:17.799]  It could be as high as 1 in 100.
[02:31:17.799 --> 02:31:20.001]  Look at this article.
[02:31:20.001 --> 02:31:26.025]  Who epidemiologist says it was devastating to see fans enjoying Euro's final unmask?
[02:31:26.025 --> 02:31:29.167]  Oh my god, we're not under UN hysteria and control?
[02:31:29.167 --> 02:31:30.788]  How horrible.
[02:31:30.788 --> 02:31:31.569]  Shock report!
[02:31:31.569 --> 02:31:35.211]  There were more COVID-19 vaccine deaths last week in the U.S.
[02:31:35.211 --> 02:31:36.312]  than COVID-19 deaths.
[02:31:36.312 --> 02:31:36.993]  See it for yourself.
[02:31:36.993 --> 02:31:38.314]  GatewayBunny.com.
[02:31:38.314 --> 02:31:39.795]  Articles also on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:39.795 --> 02:31:40.215]  Whatever you do.
[02:31:41.448 --> 02:31:41.888]  Share it.
[02:31:41.888 --> 02:31:48.891]  Oh, FDA adds Guillain-Barré that's been paralyzed to warning to Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
[02:31:48.891 --> 02:31:49.991]  Oh!
[02:31:49.991 --> 02:31:54.913]  Type in vaccines linked to Guillain-Barré in fullwars.com.
[02:31:54.913 --> 02:31:57.114]  You'll get hundreds of shows I did.
[02:31:57.114 --> 02:31:59.374]  They know damn well what they're doing.
[02:31:59.374 --> 02:32:00.715]  Damn well.
[02:32:00.715 --> 02:32:06.717]  Damn well.
[02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.058]  Let's go to Jake in Arizona.
[02:32:08.058 --> 02:32:08.758]  Jake, thanks for holding.
[02:32:08.758 --> 02:32:08.978]  Go ahead.
[02:32:11.503 --> 02:32:13.223]  Alex, hey, thanks for getting to my call.
[02:32:13.223 --> 02:32:13.623]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:13.623 --> 02:32:15.424]  Thank you.
[02:32:15.424 --> 02:32:16.284]  Great.
[02:32:16.284 --> 02:32:23.045]  I would love to do a product plug, and I would like to share with you one of the vaccine incentive programs.
[02:32:23.045 --> 02:32:23.605]  Absolutely.
[02:32:23.605 --> 02:32:24.766]  We're not screening your call, brother.
[02:32:24.766 --> 02:32:25.446]  You're live on air.
[02:32:25.446 --> 02:32:26.686]  Go ahead.
[02:32:26.686 --> 02:32:36.488]  Okay, and also pose a listener concern that I think relates directly to sort of the simulation aspect that you touched on earlier.
[02:32:36.488 --> 02:32:37.388]  I want to hear you, brother.
[02:32:37.388 --> 02:32:37.628]  Go.
[02:32:37.628 --> 02:32:39.109]  Give it to us.
[02:32:39.109 --> 02:32:40.189]  Okay, so I'm on X2, X3.
[02:32:41.679 --> 02:32:43.920]  I abused steroids for a long time.
[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:46.700]  Recently, my girlfriend and I wanted to get pregnant.
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:47.761]  You know, I stopped.
[02:32:47.761 --> 02:32:59.784]  I was taking the X2, the X3, alternating, and I had no idea that it would be so swift, but like a month later, boom, she's pregnant.
[02:32:59.784 --> 02:33:02.764]  And surprise, congratulations, it's a wonderful thing.
[02:33:02.764 --> 02:33:05.845]  Well, brother, they admit they put fluoride in the water to lower fertility.
[02:33:05.845 --> 02:33:06.945]  Well, what's the opposite of fluoride?
[02:33:06.945 --> 02:33:07.906]  It's iodine.
[02:33:07.906 --> 02:33:09.166]  So I'm glad you had that effect, brother.
[02:33:10.257 --> 02:33:12.278]  Oh yeah, it was miraculous.
[02:33:12.278 --> 02:33:13.179]  So thank you so much.
[02:33:13.179 --> 02:33:14.740]  Thank you, brother.
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:19.863]  All right, so my girlfriend works at the hospital and, you know, like I just shared with you, she's pregnant, right?
[02:33:19.863 --> 02:33:21.685]  She's not going to take the vaccine.
[02:33:21.685 --> 02:33:22.886]  She's a smart girl.
[02:33:22.886 --> 02:33:25.607]  And I guess a lot of her friends aren't going to take the vaccine either.
[02:33:25.607 --> 02:33:29.490]  But so there's this pushback that we've been hearing from within the medical community.
[02:33:30.097 --> 02:33:33.843]  And it really exists because of people that are, you know, free-thinking.
[02:33:33.843 --> 02:33:39.230]  Oh, they're ordering the injections all over the world while denying it's happening.
[02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:43.617]  Because if they don't get the majority to do it, they have trouble bullying a large minority.
[02:33:43.617 --> 02:33:44.798]  So that's why they're in so much trouble.
[02:33:44.798 --> 02:33:45.079]  Beautiful.
[02:33:46.013 --> 02:33:46.773]  Oh, for sure.
[02:33:46.773 --> 02:33:58.640]  So, late recently, like this last week, something came down through the email where they're starting this incentive program where if you wear this badge, you have to present your vaccine credentials to get this badge.
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:04.703]  But if you wear this badge, there's somebody that's going around the hospital doling out a thousand bucks to people with the badge.
[02:34:04.703 --> 02:34:12.047]  Oh, Bill Gates loves this so much because if he can kill you, that's worth millions and millions of dollars of benefits that I'll have to pay out.
[02:34:13.061 --> 02:34:13.341]  Right.
[02:34:13.341 --> 02:34:26.917]  So do you think that doctors that are making two, three hundred thousand dollars a year plus are going to be worried about, you know, like a paltry lottery when, you know, it could affect their kids and, you know, maybe they're aware of the science?
[02:34:26.917 --> 02:34:32.804]  No, it's going to affect the people that are like cleaning, you know, the janitorial crews, the people that
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:37.744]  That $1,000 could make or break them over the course of a month or two.
[02:34:37.744 --> 02:34:38.084]  Sure.
[02:34:38.084 --> 02:34:40.647]  No, this is all Nuremberg violations.
[02:34:40.647 --> 02:34:41.708]  Cut the economy off.
[02:34:41.708 --> 02:34:42.348]  Make you poor.
[02:34:42.348 --> 02:34:44.410]  Say you can't go outside until you take it.
[02:34:44.410 --> 02:34:46.472]  It all violates the Nuremberg Code.
[02:34:46.472 --> 02:34:47.693]  Great points, Jake.
[02:34:47.693 --> 02:34:49.234]  Appreciate your call.
[02:34:49.234 --> 02:34:50.395]  Amazing story.
[02:34:50.395 --> 02:34:50.996]  All right.
[02:34:50.996 --> 02:34:54.579]  Up next, Ramon in Las Vegas.
[02:34:54.579 --> 02:34:56.020]  Welcome.
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:56.741]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:34:56.741 --> 02:34:57.602]  Good to talk to you.
[02:34:58.379 --> 02:34:59.800]  Hey, so I have a quick question, man.
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:02.781]  So this is going back to like when you brought up that T.I.
[02:35:02.781 --> 02:35:07.723]  and that Candace Owens deal with the, you know, he was saying like, oh, America was upgraded, what have you.
[02:35:07.723 --> 02:35:13.506]  And you did a big listing on one of the studio maps there about how, like where slavery came from and what have you.
[02:35:13.506 --> 02:35:24.571]  So my question is, since most of the slavery that came to the United States came from Central, like Central Africa, the average monthly income right there right now is somewhere around $500.
[02:35:24.571 --> 02:35:27.432]  So my question is, albeit taboo, is you
[02:35:27.847 --> 02:35:35.685]  Do these BLM people, Colin Kaepernick, all these people, do they think that they would be better off had slavery not brought black people to America?
[02:35:37.364 --> 02:35:41.266]  You know, that still doesn't endorse slavery.
[02:35:41.266 --> 02:35:42.087]  It's a bad thing.
[02:35:42.087 --> 02:35:44.208]  No, right, right.
[02:35:44.208 --> 02:35:47.630]  But that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:56.094]  And so Kaepernick claiming some ancient thing in history to project onto modern people is done by Nike that runs slave camps in China.
[02:35:56.094 --> 02:35:58.756]  It's a discredited distraction in my view.
[02:35:58.756 --> 02:35:59.876]  Right, you're absolutely right.
[02:35:59.876 --> 02:36:02.738]  I just kind of think about that and wonder because
[02:36:03.505 --> 02:36:09.568]  Uh, you know, like, because I'm Puerto Rican, so I was a product of the slave trade, so that question actually would affect me as well.
[02:36:09.568 --> 02:36:14.110]  So, and that was kind of what I was thinking, you know, he said it was... Well, it doesn't sound to me... I'm gonna have to hold you over, Ramon.
[02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:16.771]  This is a big conversation, but it doesn't sound to me like you're a victim.
[02:36:16.771 --> 02:36:17.511]  You get it.
[02:36:17.511 --> 02:36:20.073]  What does adversity in your ancestry past mean?
[02:36:20.073 --> 02:36:22.013]  It just means we've been through adversity.
[02:36:22.013 --> 02:36:25.155]  What matters is what's currently happening now and what you stand for.
[02:36:25.155 --> 02:36:26.295]  I want to get your point.
[02:36:26.295 --> 02:36:27.616]  When we come back, sorry I went to you late.
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:37.002]  Colin Kaepernick works for a bloodthirsty globalist organization under Bill Gates' control that is carrying out the depopulation of Africa.
[02:36:37.002 --> 02:36:38.283]  Remember that.
[02:36:38.283 --> 02:36:44.044]  If you're going to murder Africa, you've got to have a black face, though Kaepernick really isn't a black person.
[02:36:44.044 --> 02:36:46.805]  He's the product of two communist white parents.
[02:36:50.829 --> 02:36:54.190]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:56.990]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:59.871]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[02:36:59.871 --> 02:37:01.311]  You must have it to live.
[02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:05.472]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[02:37:05.472 --> 02:37:10.833]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[02:37:10.833 --> 02:37:12.914]  60% off on the spray top,
[02:37:13.614 --> 02:37:18.479]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[02:37:18.479 --> 02:37:20.881]  I want to thank all the supporters that have gotten these over the years.
[02:37:20.881 --> 02:37:21.762]  They're amazing.
[02:37:21.762 --> 02:37:23.964]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[02:37:23.964 --> 02:37:29.410]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[02:37:29.410 --> 02:37:31.732]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[02:37:32.112 --> 02:37:33.612]  What are champions made of?
[02:37:33.612 --> 02:37:34.453]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:38:03.867 --> 02:38:05.528]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:05.528 --> 02:38:07.309]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:08.789]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:08.789 --> 02:38:10.350]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:10.350 --> 02:38:11.690]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:13.031]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[02:38:30.078 --> 02:38:33.541]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:38:33.541 --> 02:38:36.784]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:38:36.784 --> 02:38:37.945]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[02:38:37.945 --> 02:38:38.205]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139.
[02:38:38.205 --> 02:38:39.086]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:52.092 --> 02:38:55.473]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[02:38:55.473 --> 02:39:05.394]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[02:39:05.394 --> 02:39:08.755]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[02:39:08.755 --> 02:39:20.317]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[02:39:21.197 --> 02:39:24.159]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared.
[02:39:24.159 --> 02:39:25.840]  They're looking for leadership.
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:27.902]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[02:39:27.902 --> 02:39:28.842]  You fund us.
[02:39:28.842 --> 02:39:30.303]  You support InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:39:30.303 --> 02:39:32.265]  You get great products to you at the same time.
[02:39:32.265 --> 02:39:41.911]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, but the globalists will target you for it to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[02:39:41.911 --> 02:39:42.832]  That's our job.
[02:39:42.832 --> 02:39:49.796]  So please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can beat the shock groups and the information war.
[02:39:49.796 --> 02:39:50.657]  Fund us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:39:50.997 --> 02:39:56.682]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:39:56.682 --> 02:39:57.082]  Welcome.
[02:39:57.082 --> 02:39:57.522]  Go ahead.
[02:39:57.522 --> 02:39:58.823]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:39:58.823 --> 02:39:59.384]  Good, brother.
[02:39:59.384 --> 02:40:00.484]  Great last caller.
[02:40:00.484 --> 02:40:03.547]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:40:03.547 --> 02:40:09.251]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:40:09.251 --> 02:40:10.992]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[02:40:10.992 --> 02:40:11.793]  All right.
[02:40:11.793 --> 02:40:13.054]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:40:13.054 --> 02:40:13.995]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:40:13.995 --> 02:40:14.255]  Go ahead.
[02:40:14.335 --> 02:40:15.877]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:40:15.877 --> 02:40:18.921]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:40:18.921 --> 02:40:20.583]  The X2 Coop does wonders.
[02:40:20.583 --> 02:40:22.906]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[02:40:22.906 --> 02:40:25.769]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the InfoWars.
[02:40:25.769 --> 02:40:27.071]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:40:27.071 --> 02:40:27.732]  You're on the air.
[02:40:27.732 --> 02:40:28.292]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:28.292 --> 02:40:28.873]  Go ahead.
[02:40:28.873 --> 02:40:30.375]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:40:30.375 --> 02:40:31.136]  It's an honor.
[02:40:31.136 --> 02:40:31.416]  Honor.
[02:40:31.416 --> 02:40:31.757]  Talk to you.
[02:40:31.957 --> 02:40:33.057]  Awesome.
[02:40:33.057 --> 02:40:36.679]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[02:40:36.679 --> 02:40:38.760]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:41.241]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[02:40:41.241 --> 02:40:42.601]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:44.382]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[02:40:44.382 --> 02:40:45.243]  It definitely works.
[02:40:45.243 --> 02:40:46.883]  It's not a joke.
[02:40:46.883 --> 02:40:55.327]  Absolutely.
[02:40:55.327 --> 02:40:57.968]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:10.171 --> 02:41:13.093]  It's the final segment of Hour 3.
[02:41:13.093 --> 02:41:29.522]  That means the main Alex Jones transmission is about to end and Paul Joseph Watson from her United Kingdom's Mechanic Command Base will be taking over as the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:41:29.522 --> 02:41:37.026]  All right, Ramon, you were bringing up slavery and Colin Kaepernick and I just think they're opening old wounds here to try to
[02:41:37.794 --> 02:41:42.761]  Create fights because you're a big mega corporation raping and looting the country.
[02:41:42.761 --> 02:41:45.966]  You want to try to divert people into divide and conquer.
[02:41:45.966 --> 02:41:46.947]  That's the oldest trick of the book.
[02:41:46.947 --> 02:41:47.428]  What do you think?
[02:41:48.672 --> 02:41:56.078]  Well, yeah, like I said, because I want to think about LeBron James and, you know, all these other people who are coming out, and they've made all these millions of dollars.
[02:41:56.078 --> 02:42:05.425]  You know, let's, you know, let's, let's look and see, you know, how, how, hypothetically, how would life have been different for African Americans had slavery not brought them to it?
[02:42:05.425 --> 02:42:11.710]  And like you said before, though, be careful, because just because you weren't brought to America doesn't mean that slaves wouldn't have been taken somewhere else.
[02:42:11.710 --> 02:42:14.593]  You know, so like you said, make the best out of adversity.
[02:42:14.593 --> 02:42:15.093]  And I think
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:21.462]  Like you said, they're cutting open old wounds and just trying to use that to bleed everything out.
[02:42:21.462 --> 02:42:31.186]  Well, my point is we're all being put into globalist, big tech, medical tyranny slavery, saying we're not essential, you gotta take this dangerous shot to have a job or leave your house.
[02:42:31.186 --> 02:42:40.730]  I mean, I've got all these world leaders saying, we're gonna make it uncomfortable, you can't go to the mall, you can't go to a restaurant, you can't have a job if we don't put an experimental shot in you.
[02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:41.470]  That's crazy!
[02:42:42.372 --> 02:42:44.354]  Yeah, that's absolutely crazy.
[02:42:44.354 --> 02:42:55.182]  Like I said, I'm real divided with my family, too, because I have a brother who works in Washington, D.C., and we lock horns so hard when it comes to politics and things about Biden and Trump.
[02:42:55.182 --> 02:42:56.182]  And that was another thing, too.
[02:42:56.182 --> 02:43:09.132]  When it came to Trump, I heard a lot of stuff, because USC 364 just took place this Saturday, and I was there with EP Security, and you read Newsweek, and you read all these other people, and they're talking about, oh, he was booed, and he was jeered.
[02:43:09.132 --> 02:43:11.734]  No, I can tell you right now that when Conor McGregor walked out,
[02:43:12.344 --> 02:43:15.427]  It was an equivalent to when Donald Trump walked out.
[02:43:15.427 --> 02:43:21.093]  Oh, Trump's more popular than ever, and they want to destroy Trump because he was an independent president.
[02:43:21.093 --> 02:43:26.218]  I mean, he was perfect, but he was president, and that's what they fear, is real leaders and populist movements.
[02:43:26.218 --> 02:43:27.158]  Thank you so much, Ramon.
[02:43:27.158 --> 02:43:28.560]  Great points.
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:36.768]  Chelsea's calling from the United Kingdom, where they've announced, oh, freedom means checkpoints and medical IDs and
[02:43:37.728 --> 02:43:43.130]  Intimidation for inoculation, but not as bad as France or Greece where they said it's forced.
[02:43:43.130 --> 02:43:45.391]  You will do it, you'll never leave your house again.
[02:43:45.391 --> 02:43:46.632]  My God.
[02:43:46.632 --> 02:43:48.733]  So, Chelsea, your take on this.
[02:43:48.733 --> 02:43:51.454]  Education centers and prison towns in the UK.
[02:43:53.308 --> 02:43:56.609]  Yep, I just heard about this recently.
[02:43:56.609 --> 02:44:01.692]  Six of these prison towns have been approved so far.
[02:44:01.692 --> 02:44:09.315]  One is in construction already and they will consist of classrooms and workshops for re-education.
[02:44:09.315 --> 02:44:14.897]  So I'm wondering where all these prisoners are going to come from for these prison towns.
[02:44:17.282 --> 02:44:22.163]  Oh, I know about re-education camp documents that came out from the army under Obama.
[02:44:22.163 --> 02:44:26.784]  I know they've got plans for forced quarantines the UN's announced all over the Western world.
[02:44:26.784 --> 02:44:28.364]  It's already begun.
[02:44:28.364 --> 02:44:34.466]  Tell us more about what you learned about what they're setting up in the UK.
[02:44:34.466 --> 02:44:36.826]  I just read a few articles yesterday.
[02:44:36.826 --> 02:44:44.308]  The first thing I saw was a video online of a construction worker going into one of the prisons that's currently being built.
[02:44:45.263 --> 02:44:47.584]  And he drives through it recording people.
[02:44:47.584 --> 02:44:53.047]  Yeah, we just pulled up the footage, so yeah, so they're calling them prison towns.
[02:44:53.047 --> 02:44:55.208]  Mm-hmm, it's insane.
[02:44:55.208 --> 02:45:07.475]  And then I looked into it more and there are articles saying it consists of classrooms and workshops and it will be great for the economy, so I'm guessing it's going to be like a slave camp.
[02:45:08.354 --> 02:45:10.716]  Kind of like Chinese setup thing.
[02:45:10.716 --> 02:45:15.059]  Ma'am, they've announced they're reading all our private tech messages run by the DNC.
[02:45:15.059 --> 02:45:16.641]  I mean, it's like, wow.
[02:45:16.641 --> 02:45:18.342]  I mean, it's just like we went over the edge of a cliff.
[02:45:18.342 --> 02:45:19.183]  This is insane.
[02:45:19.183 --> 02:45:20.984]  I didn't know about the prison camps.
[02:45:20.984 --> 02:45:25.648]  Tell me, where the guys just searched UK prison towns and pulled up what you're talking about.
[02:45:25.648 --> 02:45:31.232]  Giant, sprawling, I guess, towns that'll be slave camps for those that... What is the news saying?
[02:45:31.232 --> 02:45:32.013]  Those that don't submit?
[02:45:33.824 --> 02:45:34.985]  Basically, yeah.
[02:45:34.985 --> 02:45:45.012]  So they're probably going to implement laws that if you don't get the vaccination or you don't wear your mask, you will be sent to these towns and be re-educated.
[02:45:45.012 --> 02:45:46.913]  And it's insane.
[02:45:46.913 --> 02:45:48.054]  Well, that was always the plan.
[02:45:48.054 --> 02:45:48.495]  The U.N.
[02:45:48.495 --> 02:45:52.357]  said those that don't accept the shot will be sent to quarantine towns.
[02:45:52.357 --> 02:45:54.379]  Canada already set them up last year.
[02:45:54.379 --> 02:46:00.003]  But wow, to see the footage of those giant facilities they're building.
[02:46:00.003 --> 02:46:01.164]  Wow.
[02:46:01.164 --> 02:46:03.085]  This is really the perfect takeover, isn't it?
[02:46:04.156 --> 02:46:04.957]  Wow, there it is!
[02:46:04.957 --> 02:46:07.639]  How come nobody talking about this?
[02:46:07.639 --> 02:46:10.321]  Yidong said they're building prisons around the country.
[02:46:10.321 --> 02:46:12.643]  A friend knows people working on this one.
[02:46:12.643 --> 02:46:14.525]  That's Wellingborough Prison.
[02:46:14.525 --> 02:46:16.266]  It's massive, the size of a town.
[02:46:16.266 --> 02:46:18.488]  It's supposed to be for quarantining.
[02:46:18.488 --> 02:46:19.609]  What the hell are these places?
[02:46:19.609 --> 02:46:20.650]  Wow!
[02:46:20.650 --> 02:46:22.151]  God!
[02:46:22.151 --> 02:46:26.074]  They always said in the UN documents they'd put us in re-education camps.
[02:46:26.074 --> 02:46:27.015]  Wow, there it is!
[02:46:28.482 --> 02:46:31.144]  Yeah, and now they're just building it right in front of your face.
[02:46:31.144 --> 02:46:31.885]  It's insane.
[02:46:31.885 --> 02:46:36.329]  So I just wanted to shed light on it, because nobody's talking about this.
[02:46:36.329 --> 02:46:38.170]  And they're here building them.
[02:46:38.170 --> 02:46:40.092]  It's a total authoritarian takeover.
[02:46:40.092 --> 02:46:42.233]  Can you believe it, Chelsea?
[02:46:42.233 --> 02:46:43.294]  No.
[02:46:43.294 --> 02:46:44.375]  I'm mind-blown.
[02:46:44.375 --> 02:46:48.418]  When I saw that video, I was just like, wow.
[02:46:48.418 --> 02:46:52.622]  And they said that the people in there are not to be called prisoners, but residents.
[02:46:54.403 --> 02:46:55.324]  That's what they say as well.
[02:46:55.324 --> 02:46:56.624]  Well, I see some of the articles.
[02:46:56.624 --> 02:46:58.686]  Give us the articles you're talking about, because I'm intrigued here.
[02:46:58.686 --> 02:47:07.371]  I mean, hell, I played the Canadian minister last week saying, we're going to keep everybody in martial law forever.
[02:47:07.371 --> 02:47:09.613]  You can't be allowed to walk around and talk to people.
[02:47:09.613 --> 02:47:11.374]  You might oppose what we're about to do.
[02:47:11.374 --> 02:47:14.456]  This is a communist takeover hiding behind a virus.
[02:47:14.456 --> 02:47:16.037]  And where are our Republican governors?
[02:47:16.037 --> 02:47:17.057]  Where are they?
[02:47:17.057 --> 02:47:17.958]  Where are they?
[02:47:17.958 --> 02:47:21.180]  Boris Johnson, supposedly a conservative, he's leading the attack.
[02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:25.832]  Oh yeah, our conservatives are not conservative.
[02:47:25.832 --> 02:47:28.514]  There's no such thing over here.
[02:47:28.514 --> 02:47:34.539]  Well, what are people saying about these giant re-education camps they're building?
[02:47:34.539 --> 02:47:35.740]  Nobody knows about them.
[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:41.465]  I just saw it from a video and then... By the way, guys, show that video again of the facility they're building.
[02:47:41.465 --> 02:47:48.390]  I mean, they are building gigantic re-education camps and they drive into the big giant prison gates.
[02:47:48.390 --> 02:47:49.271]  My God!
[02:47:50.313 --> 02:47:52.055]  This is how the left's gonna win, folks.
[02:47:52.055 --> 02:47:52.575]  They are.
[02:47:52.575 --> 02:47:54.277]  Approved so far.
[02:47:54.277 --> 02:47:56.338]  Six of them approved so far.
[02:47:56.338 --> 02:47:59.681]  So who are these prisons for?
[02:47:59.681 --> 02:48:00.422]  Six of them.
[02:48:00.422 --> 02:48:03.044]  We don't... Our country's not this big.
[02:48:03.044 --> 02:48:05.566]  You know, it's like the size of one state.
[02:48:05.566 --> 02:48:07.828]  Six of these prison towns?
[02:48:07.828 --> 02:48:08.349]  Insane.
[02:48:09.787 --> 02:48:22.977]  And of course, once everybody accepts the prison towns, there's already, whether it's Canada, Australia, New Zealand, all the crown countries, commonwealth countries, when you fly in, 14 days locked up.
[02:48:22.977 --> 02:48:24.678]  I mean, they just trained everybody.
[02:48:24.678 --> 02:48:25.058]  They did it.
[02:48:25.058 --> 02:48:28.381]  It's scary.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:33.101]  It's scary to see it actually unfold.
[02:48:33.101 --> 02:48:37.844]  I remember watching you, like, years ago and I'd think, yeah, but it's not really happening.
[02:48:37.844 --> 02:48:38.864]  And now it's just happening.
[02:48:38.864 --> 02:48:42.566]  Like, everything you said would happen is just happening.
[02:48:42.566 --> 02:48:44.807]  It's crazy.
[02:48:44.807 --> 02:48:46.007]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:46.007 --> 02:48:46.948]  God bless you, Chelsea.
[02:48:46.948 --> 02:48:48.609]  Give us updates as it unfolds.
[02:48:48.609 --> 02:48:48.889]  Wow.
[02:48:48.889 --> 02:48:51.410]  Let's jam in another call before we get a break.
[02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.990]  Come back with more.
[02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:54.951]  Let's talk to Brian in Michigan.
[02:48:54.951 --> 02:48:55.712]  Brian, thanks for holding.
[02:48:55.712 --> 02:48:55.952]  Go ahead.
[02:48:56.713 --> 02:48:58.094]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:48:58.094 --> 02:48:58.494]  Good, brother.
[02:48:58.494 --> 02:48:59.135]  Go ahead.
[02:48:59.135 --> 02:49:00.296]  Can I have 90 seconds?
[02:49:00.296 --> 02:49:01.256]  Yeah, please.
[02:49:01.256 --> 02:49:01.597]  All right.
[02:49:01.597 --> 02:49:03.838]  The Apocalypse of Abraham, Chapter 29.
[02:49:03.838 --> 02:49:08.481]  If you look at that, Donald Trump makes a very good appearance in there, just saying it could be.
[02:49:08.481 --> 02:49:10.943]  Not all I'm doing is asking questions.
[02:49:10.943 --> 02:49:18.949]  If he spoke the physical into existence from the spiritual, the quantum realm, that means that everything, every law that applies in the physical, our world,
[02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:21.010]  It's from the quantum realm.
[02:49:21.010 --> 02:49:25.233]  That means that you look at Isaac Newton, where every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:49:25.233 --> 02:49:27.394]  The same would apply with our conscious thought, right?
[02:49:27.394 --> 02:49:35.799]  So, if we're at, right now, 5,988, because if you look at Revelation 13, 3.5 years, right?
[02:49:35.799 --> 02:49:44.965]  So, Revelation 13.5, and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things, and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.
[02:49:45.465 --> 02:49:47.585]  That would be 3.5 years.
[02:49:47.585 --> 02:49:50.806]  Jesus was ministering for 3.5 years.
[02:49:50.806 --> 02:50:00.708]  If you go to Revelations 20, Satan is bound, and I saw an angel come down in heaven, and the key to the bottomless pit and the great chain on his hand, he laid hold of the dragon.
[02:50:00.708 --> 02:50:01.688]  Who do you think the dragon is?
[02:50:01.688 --> 02:50:02.828]  The dragon is China.
[02:50:02.828 --> 02:50:04.988]  The Chaikams are going to be coming.
[02:50:04.988 --> 02:50:07.529]  Right now, if you go backwards 2,000 years, Jesus Christ is 21 years old.
[02:50:07.529 --> 02:50:08.589]  In 2029, it's going to be the beginning of
[02:50:15.186 --> 02:50:21.233]  By the way, the globalists say the beginning of humanity begins in 2029.
[02:50:21.233 --> 02:50:22.334]  They say that.
[02:50:22.334 --> 02:50:24.036]  That's official.
[02:50:24.036 --> 02:50:26.919]  What's incredible is they are fulfilling it all themselves.
[02:50:28.202 --> 02:50:35.168]  3.5 years of tribulations that we're going to have, and if you go to Noah's prayer after the flood, Noah had a prayer with his sons.
[02:50:35.168 --> 02:50:37.750]  It's in Jubilees, the Book of Jubilees.
[02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:44.795]  One-tenth of the demons will be locked up, will be left to torment men and killed just before the Great Judgment.
[02:50:44.795 --> 02:50:49.419]  The Great Judgment would be for 3.5 years that these demons are released.
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:59.567]  10 out of 10, spiritual strength will be for 3.5 years of Jesus' ministering that he did for three and a half years.
[02:50:59.567 --> 02:51:08.893]  That said, if we're at right now year 5,988 on the line of creation, two lines are running, creation and evolution.
[02:51:08.893 --> 02:51:10.914]  Evolution is, creation is.
[02:51:10.914 --> 02:51:11.715]  Right now we're at year 5,988.
[02:51:13.616 --> 02:51:15.378]  What's going to happen at year 6,000?
[02:51:15.378 --> 02:51:27.008]  If there's one day in the Earth, it was created in six days, and there's one day to 1,000 years on Earth, when we're at year 5,000, 9, 8, 8, all I'm asking is what happens at year 6,000?
[02:51:27.008 --> 02:51:36.897]  Well, sure, if you read Revelation, there's 1,000 years after that, where the devil's chained, then unchained for a short time again, and then God rolls up the universe as a scroll and starts it all over again.
[02:51:36.897 --> 02:51:38.759]  Whatever's about to happen, it's big.
[02:51:40.709 --> 02:51:43.191]  I never had a marketing plan for InfoWars.
[02:51:43.191 --> 02:51:47.475]  I went out and found the best products I could find from the research to funder operation.
[02:51:47.475 --> 02:51:52.138]  I wanted you to get products that empowered you, that you loved, so you'd want to come back and buy more.
[02:51:52.138 --> 02:51:53.720]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:54.700]  It's very, very simple.
[02:51:54.700 --> 02:51:55.721]  It's instinctive.
[02:51:55.721 --> 02:51:56.302]  It's spiritual.
[02:51:56.302 --> 02:51:57.042]  It's what I do.
[02:51:57.042 --> 02:52:00.485]  And that said, our iodine products have become our best sellers.
[02:52:00.485 --> 02:52:07.391]  And X2 right now is discounted because listeners and viewers are habituated to only buy it when it's on sale.
[02:52:07.971 --> 02:52:09.132]  And so I'm going to catch 22.
[02:52:09.132 --> 02:52:11.414]  When I don't have it on sale, I don't sell it.
[02:52:11.414 --> 02:52:16.318]  But we're selling out of all our other products because of supply chain breakdowns, and so I'm going to catch 22.
[02:52:16.318 --> 02:52:18.340]  I need to sell products at full price, but I can't.
[02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:20.161]  I've got to sell them at discount.
[02:52:20.161 --> 02:52:21.402]  And so, it's discounted.
[02:52:21.402 --> 02:52:26.787]  40% off for the dropper bottle, 60% off for the spray bottle, even though it's about to sell out.
[02:52:26.787 --> 02:52:27.948]  It won't be available for months.
[02:52:28.388 --> 02:52:29.588]  The world is awakening.
[02:52:29.588 --> 02:52:31.529]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[02:52:31.529 --> 02:52:38.051]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[02:52:59.162 --> 02:53:08.955]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[02:53:08.955 --> 02:53:11.458]  We have forced them out in the open.
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:17.922]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[02:53:17.922 --> 02:53:22.944]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[02:53:22.944 --> 02:53:24.385]  That is invincible.
[02:53:24.385 --> 02:53:27.806]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[02:53:27.806 --> 02:53:33.569]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:37.630]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[02:53:37.630 --> 02:53:41.412]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[02:53:44.842 --> 02:53:47.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:47.605 --> 02:53:57.775]  Alright, we got five minutes left before Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:57.775 --> 02:54:01.479]  We're gonna go to Jack, Chris, and Seth, each person a minute and a half.
[02:54:01.479 --> 02:54:05.883]  Jack in Washington on Cyber Polygon Reset, large-scale attack, General Flynn.
[02:54:05.883 --> 02:54:06.444]  Give us your take.
[02:54:08.149 --> 02:54:08.650]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:08.650 --> 02:54:12.418]  Thank you, Alex, for letting me be on your show again.
[02:54:12.418 --> 02:54:16.427]  Three weeks ago, General Flynn was doing an interview with Ann Vander Stil.
[02:54:17.344 --> 02:54:29.670]  And he was warning not to worry about the zombie people, not to worry about the UFOs, but to worry about a false flag event coming because of the elections, what is being coming out.
[02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:31.011]  And so here we are now.
[02:54:31.011 --> 02:54:33.412]  They're censoring our phones.
[02:54:33.412 --> 02:54:35.713]  They're starting to censor our internets.
[02:54:35.713 --> 02:54:37.614]  They're taking down their Twitters.
[02:54:37.614 --> 02:54:42.776]  And here on the ground floor, we've been pushing this out to get it all out about the shot and the graphing.
[02:54:42.776 --> 02:54:44.417]  They're getting ready to move something big.
[02:54:45.553 --> 02:54:53.184]  Absolutely, and what I feel that folks really need to do is start paying attention to you because you are right.
[02:54:53.184 --> 02:54:54.847]  I've listened to you for years.
[02:54:54.847 --> 02:54:58.913]  You've got to listen to Mike Adams, Stu Peters, you've got to listen to all those guys out there.
[02:54:58.913 --> 02:55:00.375]  We are out here warning you.
[02:55:01.207 --> 02:55:01.928]  You as well.
[02:55:01.928 --> 02:55:08.055]  We are out here telling you folks that this is coming and they're not going to stop until they get us here on the floor.
[02:55:08.055 --> 02:55:11.019]  We are not scared of these globalists.
[02:55:11.019 --> 02:55:12.240]  We are taking them head on.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.184]  We are spreading the messages and will continue to do so.
[02:55:15.184 --> 02:55:17.587]  We trust in God and we trust in you, Alex.
[02:55:18.769 --> 02:55:21.650]  I trust in you, brother, and I trust in God, of course.
[02:55:21.650 --> 02:55:22.210]  And I agree.
[02:55:22.210 --> 02:55:24.411]  These enemies are servants of Satan.
[02:55:24.411 --> 02:55:28.673]  Don't think they've got the keys to the earth just because they're trying all this.
[02:55:28.673 --> 02:55:30.114]  This is going to be taken away from them.
[02:55:30.114 --> 02:55:32.875]  They are going to fail, but they are slaves of Satan.
[02:55:32.875 --> 02:55:33.975]  They can't help it, Jack.
[02:55:33.975 --> 02:55:35.196]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:35.196 --> 02:55:36.076]  Great points.
[02:55:36.076 --> 02:55:36.776]  Talked to him for an hour.
[02:55:36.776 --> 02:55:37.496]  Talked to all of you for an hour.
[02:55:37.496 --> 02:55:38.617]  We've got to move here.
[02:55:38.617 --> 02:55:40.298]  Let's talk to Chris in California.
[02:55:40.298 --> 02:55:41.918]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:55:41.918 --> 02:55:43.039]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:55:43.039 --> 02:55:43.619]  I'm all right, brother.
[02:55:44.825 --> 02:55:46.506]  Good, good.
[02:55:46.506 --> 02:55:47.786]  I just had a quick thing to say.
[02:55:47.786 --> 02:55:54.109]  I don't know if you've already mentioned this earlier in the show, if you guys already have articles, but Bill Gates filed for a patent.
[02:55:54.109 --> 02:56:02.992]  This was yesterday in an interview with Nick Fleming, part of the RBGCR Intel.
[02:56:02.992 --> 02:56:09.154]  This was an Intel update of Bill Gates filed a patent with a publication number of W0202060.
[02:56:14.768 --> 02:56:14.828]  606.
[02:56:14.828 --> 02:56:19.629]  So if you write that down, kind of, it's very interesting.
[02:56:19.629 --> 02:56:35.792]  I feel like, you know... That's a real patent that got filed about two years ago by Bill Gates to, there it is on screen, to track her body with an injectable system or with a biometric tracking control system via cryptocurrency.
[02:56:35.792 --> 02:56:37.713]  Yes, yes.
[02:56:37.713 --> 02:56:39.533]  Yeah, you know, this is, it's just,
[02:56:40.751 --> 02:56:42.432]  To me, it sounds like the mark.
[02:56:42.432 --> 02:56:50.916]  I mean, I don't want to put any conspiracies out there, but I just find that being a little... Sounds like the mark they're saying you can't buy or sell unless you take some deadly shot.
[02:56:50.916 --> 02:56:52.236]  Damn right it's the mark.
[02:56:52.236 --> 02:56:55.978]  Some mark that changes your DNA and puts their digital marker on you.
[02:56:55.978 --> 02:57:02.681]  They are marking us, folks, as cattle to whatever it is they're selling the planet out to.
[02:57:02.681 --> 02:57:08.003]  And after hearing this interview, as Nick Fleming said, and you quote, Bill Gates is doing the devil's work,
[02:57:08.709 --> 02:57:15.272]  And reading Revelation chapter 13 verse 16 through 18, it's just, it's right on the dot for me.
[02:57:15.272 --> 02:57:17.572]  So I just thought I'd get that out.
[02:57:17.572 --> 02:57:18.573]  I don't want to.
[02:57:18.573 --> 02:57:19.913]  No, brother, you're dead on.
[02:57:19.913 --> 02:57:20.714]  Thank you, Chris.
[02:57:20.714 --> 02:57:21.914]  Thank you, Chris.
[02:57:21.914 --> 02:57:24.655]  Last caller before Paul Watson takes over.
[02:57:24.655 --> 02:57:25.615]  Seth in Florida.
[02:57:25.615 --> 02:57:27.736]  Go ahead.
[02:57:27.736 --> 02:57:28.377]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:28.377 --> 02:57:30.797]  This is, uh, I'm just going to start it out here.
[02:57:30.797 --> 02:57:36.280]  In March, my dad, he, uh, he took the first shot of his vaccine.
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:37.360]  It was, uh, Moderna.
[02:57:37.867 --> 02:57:39.828]  He got real congested.
[02:57:39.828 --> 02:57:41.229]  Thought he just needed to knock.
[02:57:41.229 --> 02:57:42.889]  He thought it was allergies.
[02:57:42.889 --> 02:57:44.990]  Took the second shot.
[02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:48.572]  Within a day, his urine turned blood red.
[02:57:48.572 --> 02:57:50.153]  He had an autoimmune reaction.
[02:57:50.153 --> 02:57:53.194]  It shut down his kidneys.
[02:57:53.194 --> 02:57:56.956]  And it really just... He hasn't been able to get over it.
[02:57:56.956 --> 02:58:00.397]  He's on the right track, but he's on dialysis indefinitely.
[02:58:00.397 --> 02:58:01.598]  Yeah, your daddy's tougher.
[02:58:01.598 --> 02:58:02.458]  He'd be dead, brother.
[02:58:02.458 --> 02:58:03.719]  They already killed millions.
[02:58:04.662 --> 02:58:12.390]  Let me tell you, he's a prominent Methodist pastor in Tallahassee, and if he didn't believe in God, I believe he'd be gone.
[02:58:12.390 --> 02:58:16.275]  But... Well, is he going to warn people now?
[02:58:16.275 --> 02:58:22.041]  He's been warning people, but the thing is, I warned him before, and he's told me so many times I should have listened to you.
[02:58:22.041 --> 02:58:26.786]  And, you know, it's just because I've listened to your show that I know this stuff.
[02:58:27.757 --> 02:58:31.780]  About what's going on, and I've tried to tell people, and they don't want to listen.
[02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:32.220]  Hold on!
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:35.262]  Paul Joseph Watts is taking over at 10 after.
[02:58:35.262 --> 02:58:41.186]  But I want you to come back and finish the story of what happened to your father, a Methodist preacher, in Tallahassee, Florida, on the other side.
[02:58:41.186 --> 02:58:46.529]  We've got the Summit News Hour, Summit.News, with Paul Watts taking over in about 3-4 minutes.
[02:58:46.529 --> 02:58:48.831]  I'm going to come back, and let's set the floor to finish up.
[02:58:50.050 --> 02:58:56.398]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers of the body for fertility, for cellular function, for libido, for life.
[02:58:56.398 --> 02:58:59.983]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[02:58:59.983 --> 02:59:01.845]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[02:59:01.845 --> 02:59:03.907]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[02:59:03.907 --> 02:59:05.530]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[02:59:05.930 --> 02:59:06.971]  What's in that food?
[02:59:06.971 --> 02:59:07.591]  Iodine.
[02:59:07.591 --> 02:59:12.153]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[02:59:12.153 --> 02:59:14.114]  And the food itself is lacking.
[02:59:14.114 --> 02:59:17.516]  That's why most people on Earth are deficient in iodine.
[02:59:17.516 --> 02:59:21.819]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposed to need to have because they want control.
[02:59:21.819 --> 02:59:24.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, our information is powerful.
[02:59:24.100 --> 02:59:25.601]  Our products are just as powerful.

[02:59:52.245 --> 02:59:58.086]  Take the highway to the end of the night.
[02:59:58.086 --> 03:00:01.847]  End of the night.
[03:00:01.847 --> 03:00:05.387]  End of the night.
[03:00:05.387 --> 03:00:11.669]  Take a journey to the bright midnight.
[03:00:11.669 --> 03:00:14.589]  End of the night.
[03:00:14.589 --> 03:00:16.349]  End of the night.
[03:00:16.349 --> 03:00:19.230]  End of the night.
[03:00:20.698 --> 03:00:29.180]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson takes over in T-minus three minutes with the Summit News Hour every Tuesday, 2 to 3 p.m.
[03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:29.540]  Central.
[03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:36.982]  But I had to hold this caller over to just recap what happened to your dad, Methodist preacher, where this is going, how he's doing.
[03:00:36.982 --> 03:00:39.323]  Another testimony, Statham, Florida.
[03:00:39.323 --> 03:00:40.383]  Recap and restart.
[03:00:40.383 --> 03:00:42.723]  You got about two minutes.
[03:00:42.723 --> 03:00:43.404]  All right.
[03:00:43.404 --> 03:00:48.965]  In March, my dad took the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, and he got really congested.
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:54.543]  Multiple things they tell you are side effects, you know, heart inflammation, all these stuff.
[03:00:54.543 --> 03:01:01.887]  But he took the second shot after that, and immediately the next day, he found blood in his urine.
[03:01:01.887 --> 03:01:15.454]  So they tried to say that it wasn't a reaction to the vaccine, but then about three days later, they finally met somebody at the hospital that was willing to rule it out because of this rash that was going on because of the capillaries.
[03:01:15.454 --> 03:01:19.817]  It was a capillary rash that's formed whenever you have a blood
[03:01:20.822 --> 03:01:24.304]  Problem with your kidneys, because that's where it was attacking.
[03:01:24.304 --> 03:01:29.108]  And it was, uh, it caused immunogobulin A reaction in his gut.
[03:01:29.108 --> 03:01:38.093]  And basically, he had a very hard time with it at first, and even had a minor TIA about two weeks after it.
[03:01:38.093 --> 03:01:47.920]  But he's on the better track now, but he's on dialysis indefinitely, and even more so after he gets off of dialysis and his kidney function goes back to where it's supposed to be.
[03:01:48.703 --> 03:02:00.066]  They think they're going to try to use chemo cytotoxin to build a wall around his other organs to make it to where he'll be able to survive any other autoimmune reaction.
[03:02:00.066 --> 03:02:10.229]  So they're admitting his body's killing itself because you give someone an injection that attacks the spike protein that's in all your organs and so now they want to give chemotherapy to kill his immune system.
[03:02:10.896 --> 03:02:12.717]  Because his body's been turned against himself.
[03:02:12.717 --> 03:02:18.641]  What a diabolical, sick attack by Fauci who tested all this out on animals before they did this to us.
[03:02:18.641 --> 03:02:20.882]  What a monster.
[03:02:20.882 --> 03:02:22.603]  I agree completely, sir.
[03:02:22.603 --> 03:02:25.985]  You know, it's just, it's sad that we even have to go through this.
[03:02:25.985 --> 03:02:33.370]  That there's enough information out there available to people to realize what's really going on and they're not taking hold of it.
[03:02:34.229 --> 03:02:38.794]  But what can you do besides doing what you're doing and warning people?
[03:02:38.794 --> 03:02:44.961]  Well, Seth, there are murdering psychotics throughout history, like Joseph Mengele and the Nazis and the Nuremberg Code.
[03:02:44.961 --> 03:02:48.965]  Fauci and Gates and all them are admitted eugenicists that want to reduce population.
[03:02:48.965 --> 03:02:54.491]  They've done this on purpose, and we project our own goodness onto them and can't believe they're doing this to us.
[03:02:54.491 --> 03:02:55.793]  And so that's why they're getting away with it.
[03:02:56.542 --> 03:02:59.624]  They go to prison like I've said to this entire broadcast.
[03:02:59.624 --> 03:03:06.489]  Globalists must be arrested and their system dismantled now or billions will die.
[03:03:06.489 --> 03:03:10.312]  And if we don't do our duty, it's on us before God.
[03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:10.973]  That's it.
[03:03:10.973 --> 03:03:14.495]  I completely believe you, man.
[03:03:14.495 --> 03:03:16.877]  And I just want to product plug real quick, man.
[03:03:16.877 --> 03:03:22.882]  I take X2, I've got X3, I've taken Alpha Power, I've taken Primal Youth, I've taken
[03:03:23.852 --> 03:03:27.935]  Vasso Beats, I've got Ultra 12, you name it.
[03:03:27.935 --> 03:03:31.858]  Pretty much if you've got a product, I'm willing to try it and I like them all, man.
[03:03:31.858 --> 03:03:32.538]  Well, thank you, sir.
[03:03:32.538 --> 03:03:38.222]  What I really care about is getting your dad, now that he's seen what these poison shots do, to get up and speak out.
[03:03:38.222 --> 03:03:40.424]  Is he speaking out about what happened to him?
[03:03:40.424 --> 03:03:41.044]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:41.044 --> 03:03:49.610]  He went through, about three weeks ago, he was coming out of a grocery store and they had people signing up for the vaccine lines and he was telling them, you know, don't do it.
[03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:50.951]  He's like, there's no reason for it.
[03:03:50.951 --> 03:03:53.333]  And ultimately, it comes down to this, man.
[03:03:54.551 --> 03:04:01.833]  If you really believe in God and you believe in salvation, what about something you can inject into yourself can save you?
[03:04:01.833 --> 03:04:11.357]  That's just the ultimate... Well, that's it, plus saying we shouldn't interact, we shouldn't breathe on each other, we should be inhuman, we should be mechanical, run by Big Pharma with its whole giant evil history.
[03:04:11.357 --> 03:04:12.317]  Alright, that's it for me!
[03:04:12.877 --> 03:04:19.419]  I appreciate Paul Joseph Watson being here, and Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now.
[03:04:19.419 --> 03:04:22.480]  Then Owen Schroyer and the War Room, 3 p.m.
[03:04:22.480 --> 03:04:24.241]  Everybody, tell folks to tune in now.
[03:04:24.241 --> 03:04:25.661]  Paul's got a lot to say.
[03:04:25.661 --> 03:04:27.122]  Here it is, the Summit NewsHour.
[03:04:55.084 --> 03:05:14.499]  And we are live with the Summit News Hour, where I'm going to spend much of the rest of the hour talking about soccer, which I'm sure is going to delight our American listeners, given that they probably have as much interest in soccer as I have in baseball.
[03:05:14.499 --> 03:05:16.520]  But this is more than just a sport.
[03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:23.966]  This is a delineation, a fork in the road when it comes to the culture war in the United Kingdom, in England,
[03:05:25.009 --> 03:05:46.560]  Because this Euro 2020 tournament for the past 3-4 weeks has been the wokest sports tournament, at least the wokest football tournament ever staged and that was embodied to no greater degree than via the England football team to the point where the captain Harry Kane was wearing an LGBT armband for one of the matches
[03:05:47.375 --> 03:06:01.152]  To the point where we had a three-week debate about the fact that the team before every single match took the knee for BLM as a purely political message, despite their desperate claims to suggest that it isn't political.
[03:06:01.152 --> 03:06:05.258]  Again, because they've kind of embraced and absorbed these
[03:06:06.002 --> 03:06:11.306]  Religious ritualistic rights as a dogmatic religious belief system.
[03:06:11.306 --> 03:06:29.698]  So when you even raise the prospect that, no, you're taking a political stance, you're making a political gesture, they can't even fathom that that would be an argument because they've absorbed it so deep into their dogmatic religious cult that this is what we must do and it's not even a political debate.
[03:06:29.698 --> 03:06:31.219]  Well, they did that before every match.
[03:06:32.313 --> 03:06:35.856]  This was billed as, you know, a team full of immigrants.
[03:06:35.856 --> 03:06:38.958]  This was diversity being a strength.
[03:06:38.958 --> 03:06:45.903]  Not quite a strength if you actually live in England when it comes to stabbings, terrorist attacks, grooming gangs.
[03:06:45.903 --> 03:06:54.049]  But because 11 multi-millionaires can kick a ball around a field, apparently that proves that indeed diversity is a strength.
[03:06:54.910 --> 03:07:18.835]  So the success of the English team in reaching the final was kind of played up by the media and by leftists as a big stub of the nose to people on the right, to populists who think that sport shouldn't be politicised, that it shouldn't be hijacked to push far-left extremist divisive rhetoric and promotion for extremist violent groups such as Black Lives Matter.
[03:07:18.835 --> 03:07:23.196]  That was a big thumb in the nose and England's progress to the final of the competition
[03:07:24.455 --> 03:07:35.883]  Gave them the capital to grandstand and claim that they were right all along, that indeed diversity is a strength, again, because a bunch of multi-millionaires can kick a ball around the field.
[03:07:35.883 --> 03:07:38.885]  That was their hill that they chose to die on.
[03:07:38.885 --> 03:07:42.247]  England, as it turned out, had a quite easy route to the final.
[03:07:42.247 --> 03:07:50.312]  As soon as they faced a team that was actually of any quality, surprise, surprise, they lost.
[03:07:50.312 --> 03:07:51.573]  And what a shame that was.
[03:07:51.573 --> 03:07:52.474]  What a crying shame.
[03:07:53.334 --> 03:08:20.332]  So in the immediate aftermath of England losing on penalties, they had to turn around the narrative because they had had the narrative set up all along that this was a win for mass immigration, this was a win for diversity, this was a win for anti-racism, BLM, this was a win for the LGBT movement, this was the biggest snob in the nose imaginable, uniting the country around a new progressive patriotism
[03:08:21.078 --> 03:08:43.557]  Well they balled it up because they lost a penalty shootout and many people are now claiming that the manager of the England football team, Gareth Southgate, deliberately chose three black players to take the last three crucial penalties to send a political message to again rub people's noses in it that diversity is indeed a strength.
[03:08:43.557 --> 03:08:48.742]  The problem being that those three black footballers missed all their penalties
[03:08:49.537 --> 03:08:55.508]  England lost, Italy won the tournament, but then in the immediate aftermath there was a media, a leftist backlash.
[03:08:56.414 --> 03:09:04.558]  over racist social media messages sent to those three black football players who missed their crucial spot kicks.
[03:09:04.558 --> 03:09:18.905]  And as I'm going to explain after the break, this is being again regurgitated into this narrative that England is a racist country full of gammon, beer-swilling, pot-bellied louts who just all hate black people and want to abuse them.
[03:09:18.905 --> 03:09:23.688]  When you actually dig into who was sending these racist messages on Instagram and Twitter,
[03:09:24.767 --> 03:09:35.817]  The vast majority of them were not from England, they were from India and the Middle East, but the media doesn't care about that because they've got a narrative to fulfil.
[03:09:35.817 --> 03:09:42.403]  I'm going to get into that and more on the latest coronavirus lockdown news here in the United Kingdom and more after the break.
[03:09:42.403 --> 03:09:43.965]  Summit, top news, don't go away.
[03:09:48.616 --> 03:09:52.397]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[03:09:52.397 --> 03:09:54.877]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[03:09:54.877 --> 03:09:59.738]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[03:09:59.738 --> 03:10:01.239]  This is an incredible formula.
[03:10:01.239 --> 03:10:02.659]  Everybody should be taking it.
[03:10:02.659 --> 03:10:05.660]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:06.760]  It's an amazing product.
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:07.940]  It's our newest product.
[03:10:07.940 --> 03:10:10.141]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[03:10:10.141 --> 03:10:11.241]  InfoWartore.com.
[03:10:11.241 --> 03:10:12.761]  Then we have both types of X2.
[03:10:12.761 --> 03:10:16.842]  It's the exact same X2 in the bottle, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap.
[03:10:17.122 --> 03:10:21.985]  For 60% and 40% off, depending on which one, they're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:10:21.985 --> 03:10:29.710]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[03:10:29.710 --> 03:10:31.971]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:10:31.971 --> 03:10:40.316]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60% and 40% off.
[03:10:40.316 --> 03:10:41.777]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[03:10:41.777 --> 03:10:46.740]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:10:48.784 --> 03:10:52.168]  X2 has been our number one bestseller over the years.
[03:10:52.168 --> 03:10:54.951]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[03:10:54.951 --> 03:10:57.833]  It is essential for all actions in the body.
[03:10:57.833 --> 03:10:59.275]  You must have it to live.
[03:10:59.275 --> 03:11:03.459]  The UN estimates 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities because they don't have enough iodine.
[03:11:03.459 --> 03:11:09.866]  We have X2 in two different bottles, same amount in each bottle, but one has a spray top, one has a dropper top.
[03:11:09.866 --> 03:11:10.887]  60% off on the spray top,
[03:11:11.587 --> 03:11:16.432]  40% off on the dropper top for a limited time because they're both selling out.
[03:11:16.432 --> 03:11:18.774]  I want to thank all the supporters that have got me some of the years.
[03:11:18.774 --> 03:11:19.495]  They're amazing.
[03:11:19.495 --> 03:11:21.917]  So that's a great deal for you to stock up on it.
[03:11:21.917 --> 03:11:27.362]  But this deal is really for folks that have been on the fence and haven't experienced the good halogen for yourself.
[03:11:27.362 --> 03:11:29.704]  So, X2 in the dropper bottle and the spray bottle.
[03:11:30.485 --> 03:11:34.988]  60 and 40 percent off for a limited time is in selling out right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:11:34.988 --> 03:11:37.190]  But we're going to keep this sale going until it sells out.
[03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:38.831]  It'll probably take about two weeks.
[03:11:38.831 --> 03:11:39.972]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:11:39.972 --> 03:11:51.722]  Take advantage of this special right now at InfoWarsTore.com and check out the new products we just got in as well.
[03:11:51.722 --> 03:11:54.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:01.245 --> 03:12:10.967]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:12:10.967 --> 03:12:16.529]  So authorities in England were all set to announce a four-day bank holiday.
[03:12:16.529 --> 03:12:22.330]  They were preparing to erect statues of England football team manager Gareth Southgate in central London.
[03:12:22.330 --> 03:12:26.751]  They were preparing to hand out knighthoods to some of the England football players.
[03:12:27.754 --> 03:12:30.476]  And none of that happened because they lost.
[03:12:30.476 --> 03:12:42.305]  One of the reasons that they lost, and this is what many people have pointed out, and I'm trying to explain this for American listeners, because I know you don't really care about football, soccer, but there are five penalty kicks, right?
[03:12:42.305 --> 03:12:52.573]  England and Italy, they drew, went to extra time, the score was still 1-1, so the only way to decide the match was each team takes five penalty kicks from the penalty spot.
[03:12:53.610 --> 03:13:02.416]  Now, it turned out that it came down to the last kick and England needed to score this penalty kick to stay in the competition.
[03:13:02.416 --> 03:13:05.979]  If they missed the penalty, they were out of the competition.
[03:13:05.979 --> 03:13:14.505]  And the manager, Gareth Southgate, who is basically an insipid, anodyne, woke idiot who just repeats all the platitudes that he's expected to.
[03:13:14.505 --> 03:13:15.486]  He's a company man.
[03:13:15.486 --> 03:13:16.707]  He's a safe bet.
[03:13:16.707 --> 03:13:18.548]  He's an idiot.
[03:13:18.548 --> 03:13:21.490]  He chose the crucial fifth England penalty.
[03:13:21.490 --> 03:13:22.491]  He chose to give it.
[03:13:23.453 --> 03:13:31.318]  To a 19-year-old black teenager who had never taken a professional penalty in his entire life.
[03:13:31.318 --> 03:13:34.720]  Now, bear in mind the two penalty kick takers before that were also black.
[03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:36.842]  They both missed their penalties.
[03:13:36.842 --> 03:13:46.848]  There were other players in the team who were older, had more experience on the big stage and had scored more penalties in actual competitive football matches.
[03:13:47.481 --> 03:14:01.855]  But the woke, progressive, white England manager, Gareth Stoutgate, chose to give the crucial fifth penalty with the weight of the nation on this kid's shoulders to a 19-year-old boy, basically, who'd never taken a professional penalty in his life.
[03:14:01.855 --> 03:14:08.421]  Did he do that because he wanted to rub everyone's noses in it and send a political message?
[03:14:08.421 --> 03:14:09.823]  That's still up for debate.
[03:14:10.583 --> 03:14:29.561]  What's not up for debate is that he missed that penalty, England crashed out of the tournament, and then almost immediately within hours, the media had started this narrative that there were vast amounts of racist comments being aimed at these three black footballers on social media, and that they were coming from England supporters.
[03:14:30.141 --> 03:14:33.162]  I've tracked this every single time.
[03:14:33.162 --> 03:14:41.906]  Every single time there's a controversy over a black footballer being racially abused on social media, you go and look at the handles of these accounts.
[03:14:41.906 --> 03:14:43.727]  You go and look at their names.
[03:14:43.727 --> 03:14:45.227]  They're all Muslim names.
[03:14:45.227 --> 03:14:47.628]  They're all Middle Eastern names.
[03:14:47.628 --> 03:14:52.150]  And that's been documented in the aftermath of this story headline.
[03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:58.173]  Critics point to country of origin after controversy over racist messages sent to black England footballers.
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:04.521]  Some claim that manager Gareth Southgate deliberately chose black players to take the last three crucial kicks.
[03:15:04.521 --> 03:15:05.441]  I've been through that.
[03:15:05.441 --> 03:15:13.903]  However, after England lost, reports of the Instagram and Twitter accounts of the three players being flooded with racial slurs and monkey emojis immediately began to circulate.
[03:15:13.903 --> 03:15:28.107]  This led, and this has increased, this has intensified in the past couple of days, to calls for the government to hunt down the identities of those responsible with authorities vowing to, quote, make an example of the culprits.
[03:15:29.256 --> 03:15:30.463]  There's also a petition.
[03:15:31.184 --> 03:15:40.288]  Which calls for the government to pass a law that mandates people provide a verified ID before they're even allowed to open a social media account.
[03:15:40.288 --> 03:15:44.409]  That petition has over 633,000 signatures.
[03:15:44.409 --> 03:15:59.115]  So immediately the narrative was exploited to try and expand state power to try and decrease internet freedom, eviscerate internet anonymity and increase censorship based on the fact that these three black footballers were being abused.
[03:16:00.467 --> 03:16:04.569]  When you looked at who was doing the actual abuse, they weren't English.
[03:16:04.569 --> 03:16:06.149]  They didn't have English names.
[03:16:06.149 --> 03:16:14.052]  They were primarily from countries like India, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and a study showed that.
[03:16:14.052 --> 03:16:20.735]  Charlie Peters said the biggest thing about the racial abuse of footballers in England that always gets cut from the narrative is that most of it comes from abroad.
[03:16:21.969 --> 03:16:32.987]  Tory MP Michael Fabricant called on UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to investigate what proportion of the racist abuse directed at England players after the Euros actually originated in the UK.
[03:16:32.987 --> 03:16:36.833]  They don't want anyone talking about it from this angle, which is the truthful angle.
[03:16:37.273 --> 03:16:52.382]  Because it doesn't give them the pretext, it doesn't grease the skids for domestic internet censorship in the United Kingdom and the passage of a law that mandates you provide a government ID before you're even allowed to open a social media account.
[03:16:53.812 --> 03:17:18.090]  Always the excuse is exploited to expand state power on all the usual idiotic social media influencers fell for it right away and are pushing it despite the fact that the vast majority of people and I link to screenshots of this in the article who were racially abusing the England footballers had Muslim or Middle Eastern names or Indian names and indeed
[03:17:19.395 --> 03:17:26.360]  Someone did a SEMrush analysis of racist comments and emojis posted in the hours after the match ended.
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:33.586]  And that showed that the top countries of origin are India, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
[03:17:33.586 --> 03:17:45.935]  So the entire media narrative is that there was a racist backlash against black England footballers by white English people because they missed those crucial three penalties and lost the match.
[03:17:46.906 --> 03:17:53.392]  That narrative, that fake narrative, was then exploited to push for people to be, quote, made an example of.
[03:17:53.392 --> 03:18:11.046]  They want to treat them worse than paedophiles and terrorists, as I'm going to get into, and to grease the skids for the complete evisceration of online anonymity and the passage of an Internet ID, which has been a globalist aim for the best part of the past 20 years.
[03:18:11.046 --> 03:18:13.248]  We were literally publishing stories about it 15 years ago.
[03:18:15.453 --> 03:18:21.976]  And this is all based on the narrative that England is an intolerant racist country that abuses its own black football players.
[03:18:21.976 --> 03:18:24.037]  Completely not the case.
[03:18:24.037 --> 03:18:26.738]  And that was proven by another article.
[03:18:26.738 --> 03:18:30.720]  This is out of the Daily Mail from back in March earlier this year.
[03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:37.843]  It says, revealed 7 out of 10 social media posts abusing Premier League players come from trolls overseas.
[03:18:39.853 --> 03:18:41.495]  So at least 70% of it, and I would argue more from what I'm seeing,
[03:18:55.347 --> 03:18:58.028]  It comes from outside the country.
[03:18:58.028 --> 03:19:09.791]  It comes from people in countries that are more racist than England, which is still a predominantly white country, because that's a fact that leftists who live in this utopia still can't seem to grasp.
[03:19:09.791 --> 03:19:13.552]  That racism is way worse in non-white countries.
[03:19:13.552 --> 03:19:20.954]  Have you seen how Chinese people treat even other Chinese people who have darker skin complexions?
[03:19:20.954 --> 03:19:24.415]  Have you seen how black people get treated in Chinese airports?
[03:19:26.266 --> 03:19:30.790]  Have you seen how the Indian caste system works and how that works in other countries?
[03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:35.615]  How the only countries in which slavery still exists are all non-white.
[03:19:35.615 --> 03:19:41.161]  Yes, other countries are way more racist than Western white European countries.
[03:19:41.161 --> 03:19:42.462]  It's way worse.
[03:19:42.462 --> 03:19:47.847]  That's one reason why you have the racial abuse of black England footballers.
[03:19:47.847 --> 03:19:49.449]  Because that's just what they do.
[03:19:49.449 --> 03:19:50.710]  That's how they get their jollies.
[03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:57.486]  Also, you have a lot of angry people who placed giant bets on England winning this tournament.
[03:19:57.486 --> 03:19:58.067]  Those bets.
[03:19:58.903 --> 03:20:05.369]  Came to nothing because these three footballers missed their penalties, so then they're lashing out by racially abusing them.
[03:20:05.369 --> 03:20:08.893]  Again, most of the messages come from outside of the country.
[03:20:08.893 --> 03:20:23.287]  So for the media to drum up this narrative that this is a white, working class, English, gammon problem, that these pot-bellied drunkards are going on social media and abusing football players because they missed penalties,
[03:20:23.827 --> 03:20:39.196]  The stats do not bear it out, but they're going to push this narrative to completely eviscerate internet anonymity, internet freedom, and to literally hunt down and make an example out of people who don't even live in the country.
[03:20:39.196 --> 03:20:42.518]  Going to get into COVID and the latest on the restrictions on the other side.
[03:20:42.518 --> 03:20:48.281]  Summit, Got News, and go away.
[03:20:48.281 --> 03:20:52.604]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:20:53.377 --> 03:20:56.079]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support.
[03:20:56.079 --> 03:20:57.319]  Constantly.
[03:20:57.319 --> 03:21:00.661]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:21:00.661 --> 03:21:02.102]  And we're all in this together.
[03:21:02.102 --> 03:21:07.465]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:21:07.465 --> 03:21:08.146]  But it's true.
[03:21:08.146 --> 03:21:11.568]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:21:12.308 --> 03:21:13.008]  We're good to go.
[03:21:29.975 --> 03:21:32.056]  And America's still quasi-free.
[03:21:32.056 --> 03:21:33.157]  You can't have InfoWars.
[03:21:33.157 --> 03:21:37.179]  It's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:21:37.179 --> 03:21:39.300]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:21:39.300 --> 03:21:42.002]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:42.002 --> 03:21:45.444]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:21:45.444 --> 03:21:47.225]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:21:47.225 --> 03:21:47.445]  Thank you.
[03:21:48.724 --> 03:21:50.284]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[03:21:50.284 --> 03:21:51.044]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:21:51.044 --> 03:21:51.785]  Trying to move quicker.
[03:21:51.785 --> 03:21:52.625]  Hey, Alex.
[03:21:52.625 --> 03:21:53.065]  Welcome.
[03:21:53.065 --> 03:21:58.226]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[03:21:58.226 --> 03:22:01.606]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[03:22:01.606 --> 03:22:08.048]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[03:22:08.048 --> 03:22:09.728]  Living Defense saved my life.
[03:22:09.728 --> 03:22:13.869]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[03:22:13.869 --> 03:22:15.329]  Living Defense brought me back.
[03:22:15.609 --> 03:22:21.011]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[03:22:21.011 --> 03:22:23.533]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[03:22:23.533 --> 03:22:32.837]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[03:22:32.837 --> 03:22:38.259]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[03:22:38.259 --> 03:22:39.800]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:47.517]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[03:22:49.071 --> 03:22:57.237]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:22:57.237 --> 03:23:06.003]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:23:06.003 --> 03:23:12.967]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:12.967 --> 03:23:15.589]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[03:23:15.589 --> 03:23:18.031]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[03:23:18.291 --> 03:23:18.511]  I think?
[03:23:52.452 --> 03:23:53.713]  Jacob in Ohio.
[03:23:53.713 --> 03:23:54.113]  Welcome.
[03:23:54.113 --> 03:23:54.553]  Go ahead.
[03:23:54.553 --> 03:23:55.853]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:23:55.853 --> 03:23:56.413]  Good, bro.
[03:23:56.413 --> 03:23:57.514]  Great last caller.
[03:23:57.514 --> 03:24:00.575]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[03:24:00.575 --> 03:24:06.277]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[03:24:06.277 --> 03:24:08.017]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[03:24:08.017 --> 03:24:08.797]  All right.
[03:24:08.797 --> 03:24:10.078]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[03:24:10.078 --> 03:24:10.958]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[03:24:10.958 --> 03:24:11.118]  Go ahead.
[03:24:11.378 --> 03:24:12.920]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:24:12.920 --> 03:24:15.943]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the Ponda product.
[03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:17.625]  The X2 does wonders.
[03:24:17.625 --> 03:24:18.746]  I recommend it to everybody.
[03:24:18.746 --> 03:24:19.928]  You're on the fence about it.
[03:24:19.928 --> 03:24:20.729]  Get off the fence.
[03:24:20.729 --> 03:24:21.610]  Get the product.
[03:24:21.610 --> 03:24:22.811]  Support the info war.
[03:24:22.811 --> 03:24:24.112]  Tyler in Maine.
[03:24:24.112 --> 03:24:24.773]  You're on the air.
[03:24:24.773 --> 03:24:25.334]  Thanks for rolling.
[03:24:25.334 --> 03:24:25.694]  Go ahead.
[03:24:25.694 --> 03:24:27.396]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[03:24:27.396 --> 03:24:27.977]  It's an honor.
[03:24:28.297 --> 03:24:29.898]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[03:24:29.898 --> 03:24:30.339]  Awesome.
[03:24:30.339 --> 03:24:33.701]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[03:24:33.701 --> 03:24:37.885]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[03:24:37.885 --> 03:24:39.626]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[03:24:39.626 --> 03:24:41.307]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[03:24:41.307 --> 03:24:42.288]  Well, it definitely works.
[03:24:42.288 --> 03:24:43.929]  It's not a joke.
[03:24:43.929 --> 03:24:51.816]  Absolutely.
[03:24:51.816 --> 03:24:54.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:25:17.373 --> 03:25:28.796]  We're continuing to talk about this racial abuse controversy in the United Kingdom which is being exploited by all the usual suspects to push for more internet censorship, regulation, internet ID, which they've been
[03:25:29.753 --> 03:25:36.796]  Trying to get for the best part of 20 years now, I remember articles about it literally in the early 2000s.
[03:25:36.796 --> 03:25:56.244]  Of course, that's used across the world by repressive regimes to silence, track down, hunt down true political dissidents, so it's no surprise that they would want to copy authoritarian regimes like Communist China and introduce that based off the back of idiot social media influencers and YouTubers who don't know what the hell's going on.
[03:25:57.043 --> 03:26:04.865]  And just get railroaded by this fear-mongering propaganda about racial abuse into supporting it, promoting their little petitions.
[03:26:04.865 --> 03:26:14.047]  Despite the fact that the vast majority of the abuse is coming from people in Egypt, United Arab Emirates, India, and all these other Middle East and South Asian countries.
[03:26:14.047 --> 03:26:19.068]  The facts don't matter though when there's a bandwagon to jump on as per usual.
[03:26:19.068 --> 03:26:25.309]  Toby Young tweeted, to put the scale of the racist abuse the England players receive on Twitter into context,
[03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:35.737]  The Guardian analysed more than 585,000 tweets aimed at the players during the group stages and found 44 explicitly racist messages.
[03:26:35.737 --> 03:26:40.680]  That's 0.0075% of the total.
[03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:46.785]  So this is the big racial abuse controversy that we're being told is so deadly serious.
[03:26:48.334 --> 03:26:58.398]  Paul Embry tweeted, when an idiot fan invades the pitch, the TV cameras quite rightly turn away to ensure he doesn't get the publicity he craves and to discourage others from doing the same.
[03:26:58.398 --> 03:27:03.880]  When a tiny number of idiots racially abuse players, we give them wall-to-wall media coverage.
[03:27:03.880 --> 03:27:04.980]  Go figure.
[03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:08.001]  Yeah, ever heard of Don't Feed the Trolls?
[03:27:08.001 --> 03:27:15.644]  That one of the primary reasons they do this every time is because they know they're going to get saturation media coverage for the next week.
[03:27:15.644 --> 03:27:17.445]  That's what they want, that's what they get.
[03:27:19.628 --> 03:27:31.618]  Boris Johnson holds showdown with social media firms demanding that they up their game as PM says details of anonymous racist trolls who abused Euro 2020 penalty misses must be handed over.
[03:27:31.618 --> 03:27:33.460]  Instagram has a feature.
[03:27:33.460 --> 03:27:39.145]  Twitter has a feature where you can control who replies to your Instagram posts or your tweets.
[03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:43.492]  You can set it so only your followers can reply to them.
[03:27:43.492 --> 03:27:45.533]  You can block whoever you want.
[03:27:45.533 --> 03:27:48.675]  That doesn't matter, though, because that's not what they really care about.
[03:27:48.675 --> 03:27:53.797]  They really care about grabbing even more power.
[03:27:53.797 --> 03:27:56.439]  And now we come to this idiot.
[03:27:56.439 --> 03:28:02.002]  Radio host says racists should have bank accounts citizenship stripped.
[03:28:02.002 --> 03:28:06.264]  This is Mike Graham, who you may remember as the guy who tried to ruin
[03:28:07.263 --> 03:28:11.809]  Marcus Meacham count Dankula's life over the Nazi pub joke.
[03:28:11.809 --> 03:28:17.475]  This guy's supposedly a centre-right populist host on the radio.
[03:28:17.475 --> 03:28:23.482]  Well, now he's called for, quote, racists to be stripped of their bank accounts, passports and other life necessities.
[03:28:23.482 --> 03:28:27.547]  Treating them worse than literal sex traffickers and terrorists, by the way.
[03:28:28.647 --> 03:28:34.874]  An interesting assertion given that Graham himself has been denounced as a racist numerous times before.
[03:28:34.874 --> 03:28:41.962]  We have a 35 second clip of these moronic comments that he made earlier today on Talk Radio and here it is.
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:55.320]  And I've got a plan.
[03:28:55.320 --> 03:29:04.243]  The time has come to not only find these people, and not only to prosecute them for their lawless behaviour, but also basically to excommunicate them from our society.
[03:29:04.243 --> 03:29:09.104]  So forget about locking them up, forget about throwing away the key, forget about banning them from football stadiums, right?
[03:29:09.104 --> 03:29:10.365]  I've got a better idea.
[03:29:10.365 --> 03:29:14.366]  Instead, let's make it impossible for them to actually have a life.
[03:29:14.366 --> 03:29:18.127]  No bank account, no ability to travel, no passport, no benefits, nothing.
[03:29:18.127 --> 03:29:20.108]  Forget kick it out, let's kick them out.
[03:29:20.108 --> 03:29:22.268]  We don't need them, Britain doesn't need them.
[03:29:22.268 --> 03:29:23.349]  Adios!
[03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.829]  Amigos!
[03:29:24.509 --> 03:29:28.930]  And you don't like it because I've said that in Spanish.
[03:29:28.930 --> 03:29:30.311]  Yeah, great idea, Mike.
[03:29:30.311 --> 03:29:33.492]  Why don't we just hang them on the jibbit on a street corner as well?
[03:29:33.492 --> 03:29:38.994]  I don't think stripping them of statehood and citizenship and passports and bank accounts is enough.
[03:29:38.994 --> 03:29:42.835]  If they said something mean on the internet.
[03:29:42.835 --> 03:29:45.936]  And after all, who gets to decide who is racist?
[03:29:45.936 --> 03:29:49.997]  You know someone who has been denounced as a racist on numerous occasions?
[03:29:49.997 --> 03:29:52.478]  Well, it's Mike Graham himself.
[03:29:54.387 --> 03:30:02.332]  In 2019, Graham said, I hate Poles live on air, prompting a listener to phone in and accuse him of being racist for hating Polish people.
[03:30:02.332 --> 03:30:05.995]  And I mean, surely the accusation alone is enough, right?
[03:30:05.995 --> 03:30:07.956]  Why don't we seize your bank account?
[03:30:07.956 --> 03:30:10.458]  Why don't we take your passport?
[03:30:10.458 --> 03:30:12.759]  What an idiot!
[03:30:12.759 --> 03:30:17.983]  He was actually seriously accused of racism and actually was racist in 2020.
[03:30:20.231 --> 03:30:27.051]  Where he was accused of anti-Irish racism after he repeatedly called Twitter user John O'Connell a paddy.
[03:30:27.808 --> 03:30:28.709]  Several times!
[03:30:28.709 --> 03:30:33.913]  This is after he said Celtic Football Club was a paedophile football club, by the way.
[03:30:33.913 --> 03:30:51.467]  So apparently Mike Graham can say offensive things on Twitter, he can call Irish people anti-Irish racial slurs all day long on Twitter, but he gets to keep his bank account, he gets to keep his passport, he gets to remain a citizen of the United Kingdom.
[03:30:52.074 --> 03:30:52.695]  Think about this.
[03:30:52.695 --> 03:30:56.341]  He's literally calling for, quote, racist.
[03:30:56.341 --> 03:30:59.427]  The definition of which is so vague and slippery at this point.
[03:31:00.402 --> 03:31:02.203]  That anything is racism.
[03:31:02.203 --> 03:31:06.686]  We had an article today about how soap dispensers were racist, for God's sake.
[03:31:06.686 --> 03:31:22.857]  And you want to empower people who think everything's racist to have the power to strip people of their citizenship, their passports, their bank accounts, their benefits, to make it impossible for them to live other than on a park bench, at best, if that.
[03:31:23.437 --> 03:31:31.761]  When you yourself have been accused of being racist on numerous occasions before, who the hell are you pandering to?
[03:31:31.761 --> 03:31:42.385]  Some idiot on GB News this morning, which is supposed to be the anti-woke news channel, got down on one knee and started blathering on about how great Black Lives Matter was.
[03:31:43.127 --> 03:31:45.389]  Another complete idiot.
[03:31:45.389 --> 03:31:55.499]  These people aren't genuinely right-wing, they're not genuinely conservative, they're not genuinely putting up a fight against this woke takeover by these ideological jihadists.
[03:31:55.499 --> 03:31:59.403]  They're all complete grifters and this proves it yet again.
[03:31:59.403 --> 03:32:06.890]  He's literally calling for people who cause offence on the internet, boo-hoo, which basically everything is at this point,
[03:32:07.737 --> 03:32:12.681]  To be treated worse than terrorists, worse than violent convicted criminal.
[03:32:12.681 --> 03:32:17.825]  Even violent convicted criminals can still process financial transactions.
[03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:23.030]  They don't get their citizenship, their statehood, their passport removed.
[03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:26.593]  He's calling for them to be treated worse than that.
[03:32:26.593 --> 03:32:35.320]  Absolute moronic idiocy, once again from Mike Graham, but he's got a lot of form, so no surprise there.
[03:32:36.892 --> 03:32:42.919]  Sean Keverney on Twitter, meanwhile, says that being a racist isn't an opinion you're entitled to.
[03:32:42.919 --> 03:32:54.452]  If you discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity, you're dangerous, you deserve to be vilified, you deserve to lose your job, you're not being cancelled, you're being left behind by a society that rejects you.
[03:32:54.452 --> 03:32:57.015]  This is a journalist who I believe worked for the BBC.
[03:32:58.203 --> 03:33:04.308]  And again he's saying, quote, if you discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity, you're dangerous.
[03:33:04.308 --> 03:33:11.915]  That's quite awkward, because Mr. Keveny's employer, the BBC, does precisely that.
[03:33:11.915 --> 03:33:13.496]  Headline, how is this legal?
[03:33:13.496 --> 03:33:17.920]  BBC bans white people from applying for Springwatch and one show job.
[03:33:19.798 --> 03:33:27.141]  The BBC has found itself at the centre of a discrimination storm after banning white people from applying for a production management role.
[03:33:27.141 --> 03:33:31.422]  As one furious critic musing, imagine the riots if it had been the other way round.
[03:33:31.422 --> 03:33:37.944]  So I agree with Sean Keveny that it is dangerous to discriminate against someone because of their ethnicity.
[03:33:37.944 --> 03:33:42.866]  Well, your employer does precisely that.
[03:33:42.866 --> 03:33:47.948]  Meanwhile, Theodore Darwin, Paul the British author, writes, the worldview of the providential class
[03:33:49.065 --> 03:34:15.076]  He says that if, despite everything, immigrants or people of immigrant descent, especially those of different races, are prospering and integrating well into society, there is no need of a providential class of academics, journalists, bureaucrats and others to rescue them from the slough of despondency supposedly brought about by prejudice and discrimination, many a career opportunity would be lost if there were no systemic injustices of this sort to entangle.
[03:34:15.706 --> 03:34:21.592]  He says, for the providential class, ethnic minorities in Britain are mired in an oppressive neopartite state.
[03:34:21.592 --> 03:34:29.101]  The only solution is felt to be virtually totalitarian control over society by the providential class.
[03:34:29.101 --> 03:34:31.964]  And that's precisely what they're doing in the aftermath of this
[03:34:32.544 --> 03:34:45.514]  Racist messages, abuse controversy, completely mischaracterizing it, completely hiding the true origin source of it to clamp down on our freedoms to create internet ID and more online censorship.
[03:34:45.514 --> 03:34:47.135]  Summit.News will be back, don't go away.
[03:34:47.675 --> 03:34:56.160]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:56.160 --> 03:35:06.687]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:35:06.687 --> 03:35:16.353]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:35:16.673 --> 03:35:22.659]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[03:35:22.659 --> 03:35:27.523]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:35:27.523 --> 03:35:39.934]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and valerian roots.
[03:35:40.194 --> 03:35:51.907]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[03:35:51.907 --> 03:35:53.108]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:35:53.108 --> 03:35:53.929]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:35:53.929 --> 03:35:55.030]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.210]  Go ahead.
[03:35:57.687 --> 03:35:58.708]  I love your products.
[03:35:58.708 --> 03:36:09.419]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[03:36:09.419 --> 03:36:15.425]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[03:36:15.425 --> 03:36:16.446]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[03:36:18.708 --> 03:36:26.409]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[03:36:26.409 --> 03:36:35.171]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[03:36:35.171 --> 03:36:35.991]  This is working.
[03:36:35.991 --> 03:36:36.991]  This is wonderful.
[03:36:36.991 --> 03:36:41.512]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[03:36:41.512 --> 03:36:46.153]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[03:36:50.313 --> 03:37:05.027]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[03:37:06.817 --> 03:37:13.860]  Being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[03:37:13.860 --> 03:37:30.507]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[03:37:30.507 --> 03:37:33.949]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[03:37:34.549 --> 03:37:35.991]  So don't worship the Globalist.
[03:37:35.991 --> 03:37:37.632]  Don't worship the NFL.
[03:37:37.632 --> 03:37:39.494]  Don't worship all the things of the system.
[03:37:39.494 --> 03:37:41.336]  But worship the things of God.
[03:37:41.336 --> 03:37:42.937]  Because we're made by God.
[03:37:42.937 --> 03:37:44.639]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[03:37:44.639 --> 03:37:46.100]  And appreciate free speech.
[03:37:46.100 --> 03:37:47.261]  While you still have it.
[03:37:47.261 --> 03:37:48.062]  While you still have it.
[03:37:49.128 --> 03:37:52.909]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements in the next 60 seconds.
[03:37:52.909 --> 03:37:55.409]  First off, green fiber capsules.
[03:37:55.409 --> 03:38:00.270]  Highest quality fiber you're going to find with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[03:38:00.270 --> 03:38:01.751]  This is an incredible formula.
[03:38:01.751 --> 03:38:03.171]  Everybody should be taking it.
[03:38:03.171 --> 03:38:06.172]  Men, women, children, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[03:38:06.172 --> 03:38:07.292]  It's an amazing product.
[03:38:07.292 --> 03:38:08.472]  It's our newest product.
[03:38:08.472 --> 03:38:10.653]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[03:38:10.653 --> 03:38:11.753]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:38:11.753 --> 03:38:13.293]  Then we have both types of X2.
[03:38:13.293 --> 03:38:17.354]  It's the exact same X2 as the model, but one has a spray cap, one has a dropper cap.
[03:38:17.634 --> 03:38:22.515]  For 60% and 40% off, depending on which one, they're both excellent at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:38:22.515 --> 03:38:30.218]  The 60% off of the spray bottle is unprecedented, but I want you to experience the power of the good halogen and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[03:38:30.218 --> 03:38:32.498]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:38:32.498 --> 03:38:40.841]  The new green fiber capsules, 50% off, and X2 in the spray bottle and in the dropper bottle for 60% and 40% off.
[03:38:40.841 --> 03:38:42.281]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[03:38:42.281 --> 03:38:47.243]  Experience Deep Earth Crystal Iodine for itself and keep your gut healthy at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:38:51.292 --> 03:39:04.503]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:39:04.503 --> 03:39:13.070]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:39:15.939 --> 03:39:33.383]  You're back and we're going to switch gears to Covid now because we've got the big Freedom Day on July 19th where we get back all the freedoms that we should have had anyway from the gracious government who people have been genuflecting to after being brainwashed by their behavioural psychologists for the past 16 months.
[03:39:33.383 --> 03:39:41.764]  A poll last week found that 40% of the British public wanted mask mandates to remain in place forever.
[03:39:41.764 --> 03:39:44.365]  That's how much they've been terrorised and traumatised
[03:39:45.129 --> 03:39:51.133]  And made into lily-livered, limp-wristed, yellow bellies by this propaganda.
[03:39:51.133 --> 03:39:55.715]  Yeah, when you actually look at the stats, the fear-mongering doesn't seem to be too justified.
[03:39:55.715 --> 03:40:00.478]  Headline, just 25 under-18s died from COVID in England.
[03:40:00.478 --> 03:40:03.920]  Hundreds died from suicide and trauma, but we don't talk about that.
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:10.184]  New figures released by researchers in the UK show that just 25 under-18s died from COVID from March 2020 to February 2021.
[03:40:12.708 --> 03:40:25.517]  Two-thirds of whom had chronic health conditions, and that lockdown measures aimed at children, quote, may prove a greater risk than of SARS-CoV-19 itself.
[03:40:25.517 --> 03:40:34.764]  Numbers show that there's around a one in 500,000 chance of children dying from coronavirus in England, and that includes victims of pre-existing medical conditions like heart disease and cancer.
[03:40:34.764 --> 03:40:39.447]  But still, apparently, we have to vaccinate them all, despite the fact that 25
[03:40:41.611 --> 03:40:51.194]  Over the course of a year of this deadly pandemic have died and two-thirds of them had chronic health conditions.
[03:40:51.194 --> 03:40:59.357]  Yet we still have to vaccinate all the kids despite the fact that obviously more of them are going to die from complications from the vaccine than the virus itself.
[03:40:59.357 --> 03:41:04.139]  Because virtue signaling is more important than actually saving lives.
[03:41:04.139 --> 03:41:10.241]  WHO epidemiologist says it was quote devastating to see fans enjoying Euro's final unmasked.
[03:41:10.241 --> 03:41:10.841]  Oh my god!
[03:41:11.636 --> 03:41:14.178]  They weren't wearing masks!
[03:41:14.178 --> 03:41:25.027]  The leading World Health Organisation epidemiologist says it was devastating to see crowds at Wembley enjoying the European Championships final without wearing face masks.
[03:41:25.027 --> 03:41:28.931]  66,000 fans gathered inside the stadium to see Italy defeat England.
[03:41:28.931 --> 03:41:30.152]  Again, what a shame that was.
[03:41:31.568 --> 03:41:44.479]  On Sunday night, Maria Van Kerkhove expressed her disgust that supporters were able to enjoy the match en masse despite it being outdoors and within existing COVID-19 rules for mass to not be required, so she had a big hissy fit about it on Twitter.
[03:41:44.479 --> 03:41:49.523]  She said, The COVID-19 pandemic is not taking a break tonight.
[03:41:49.523 --> 03:41:59.451]  SARS, COVID, Delta variant will take advantage of unvaccinated people in crowded settings, en masse, screaming, shouting, singing, devastating!
[03:41:59.451 --> 03:42:00.372]  That was her hissy fit.
[03:42:01.641 --> 03:42:16.886]  So apparently people being allowed to go back to normal life is devastating, despite the fact that the government literally held numerous major trials at sporting events where the spread of COVID-19 was found to be infinitesimal as a result, with people not wearing masks.
[03:42:16.886 --> 03:42:25.108]  The fans who attended the game were made to provide proof of vaccination or negative COVID test on condition of entry, which they're now going to roll out to the rest of society, by the way.
[03:42:25.108 --> 03:42:26.529]  I'll get onto that in the next bit.
[03:42:27.708 --> 03:42:30.049]  Of course, we know with masks.
[03:42:30.049 --> 03:42:49.818]  The great saint himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Jesus returned, the Pope, all in one, God himself, God of science, admitted in February 2020 that a store-bought face mask, quote, is not really effective in keeping out virus which is small enough to pass through the material.
[03:42:49.818 --> 03:42:51.859]  Don't talk about that anymore, do they?
[03:42:53.123 --> 03:42:57.487]  There was only one major peer-reviewed study as to the efficacy of masks by the way.
[03:42:57.487 --> 03:42:59.569]  It took place in Denmark.
[03:42:59.569 --> 03:43:00.510]  Involved 6,000 participants.
[03:43:02.671 --> 03:43:12.534]  And it found that, quote, there was no statistically significant difference between those who wore masks and those who did not when it came to being infected by COVID-19.
[03:43:12.534 --> 03:43:19.096]  And yet they're still trying to keep these mask mandates in place for eternity, forever.
[03:43:19.096 --> 03:43:28.039]  And on that subject, the famous British author Peter Hitchens appeared on, I think it was GB News, to talk about how masks are indeed
[03:43:28.988 --> 03:43:33.390]  A pure form of virtue signalling completely useless and completely ineffective.
[03:43:33.390 --> 03:43:36.751]  Here is that clip.
[03:43:36.751 --> 03:43:54.337]  People should continue to assert that they work since the government itself and the World Health Organization right up until June last year were perfectly clear that they made very little difference either in protecting people from infection or from preventing them from passing on infection.
[03:43:55.068 --> 03:44:05.369]  There has been only one major randomised control trial into the effectiveness of MAS, the DanMAS trial, which went largely unreported by most British media.
[03:44:06.281 --> 03:44:16.688]  And what that said was that the difference between those who wore masks and those who did not in actually getting infected was statistically insignificant.
[03:44:16.688 --> 03:44:22.211]  So I think you should be a bit less confident about asserting that masks work in themselves.
[03:44:22.211 --> 03:44:30.036]  The other simple point here that we have to make is that there is a big difference between the loose cloth masks which are commonly worn by the public
[03:44:30.896 --> 03:44:48.145]  And the sort of masks which are worn in hospitals, which are the N95 type particularly, which costs an awful lot more, which can only be worn once, which if touched while it's being worn becomes useless, and is entirely different both in nature and use from the things which are being worn.
[03:44:48.145 --> 03:44:53.608]  And the other thing is that there doesn't seem to be any serious correlation between mask usage
[03:44:54.268 --> 03:44:58.650]  And the levels of infections and COVID around the world, if you compare all countries.
[03:44:58.650 --> 03:45:07.913]  I think the other thing we must remember is a fascinating scoop by Deborah Cohen, the medical correspondent of BBC Newsnight.
[03:45:07.913 --> 03:45:22.698]  A year ago now, when the World Health Organization reversed its position on masks, she inquired and discovered from contacts that the decision had not been taken as a result of medical information, but for political reasons.
[03:45:23.274 --> 03:45:29.198]  And she put this to her contacts at WHO and they did not in any way seek to put her off it.
[03:45:29.198 --> 03:45:51.853]  I think, and I think there's evidence of this all over the place, the reason why the British government and some others seek to continue mask wearing is that they see it as a badge of compliance and that they think that if people stop wearing masks, as they have in large parts of the United States now I believe, if they stop wearing masks then the whole atmosphere of what I would call fear and panic does increase.
[03:45:52.653 --> 03:45:58.456]  I don't think it's particularly factually based and I think people should be wary of people just asserting
[03:46:21.787 --> 03:46:22.567]  That it is so.
[03:46:22.567 --> 03:46:31.211]  If you, if anybody ever says you will master it, ask them to cite the proper randomised control trials of the gold standard of this kind of study.
[03:46:31.211 --> 03:46:39.034]  Ask them to cite the randomised control trial, which actually shows that what they're saying is true.
[03:46:41.798 --> 03:46:54.108]  Meanwhile, despite the fact that, as Peter Hitchens explained there, there's no evidence that masks actually reduce COVID-19 transmission, The Telegraph reports COVID passports and masks are required at sporting events in England after July 19th.
[03:46:54.108 --> 03:46:56.350]  Oh, so it isn't Freedom Day?
[03:46:56.350 --> 03:46:58.151]  Oh, we're lifting all the restrictions?
[03:46:58.151 --> 03:46:59.112]  No, you're not.
[03:46:59.112 --> 03:46:59.912]  No, you're not.
[03:46:59.912 --> 03:47:05.437]  You're introducing vaccine passports, which you denied you were doing for months on end, while secretly funding them.
[03:47:06.613 --> 03:47:13.859]  Now, fans attending sporting events in England after July 19 will require a Covid passport and will be told to wear masks.
[03:47:13.859 --> 03:47:31.114]  And, of course, the costs of getting a negative Covid test every time you want to enter into a theatre, a venue, whatever, a sports stadium, are extremely prohibitive for most people, so it's another way to force them to get the much-vaunted vaccine.
[03:47:32.222 --> 03:47:35.523]  Farage predicts government could bring back restrictions by September.
[03:47:35.523 --> 03:47:37.663]  That's precisely what they're planning to do.
[03:47:37.663 --> 03:47:39.224]  It never ends.
[03:47:39.224 --> 03:47:46.085]  Meanwhile in France, Macron announces those without Covid vaccine pass will be banned from routine life activities.
[03:47:46.085 --> 03:47:47.785]  Oh, but it's not mandatory.
[03:47:47.785 --> 03:47:58.508]  You just won't be able to go into a shopping mall, a cafe, a hospital, a bar, a cinema, an educational institution, basically anywhere unless you get the vaccine.
[03:47:58.508 --> 03:47:59.848]  But it's not mandatory.
[03:48:00.959 --> 03:48:12.743]  French President Emmanuel Macron announced that those who don't have a Covid pass will be banned from participating in basic life activities such as visiting shopping malls, restaurants and using public transport.
[03:48:12.743 --> 03:48:20.285]  Now they tried to pass this, by the way, back in December on the banning of people who were unvaccinated using public transport.
[03:48:20.285 --> 03:48:24.426]  There were fierce protests against it and they had to roll it back.
[03:48:24.426 --> 03:48:26.747]  Will it be rolled back now?
[03:48:26.747 --> 03:48:29.328]  Where are the yellow vests, the gilets jaunes?
[03:48:30.399 --> 03:48:33.782]  To fight back against this obvious state tyranny.
[03:48:33.782 --> 03:48:45.493]  What they did in France, in an effort to force more people to take the vaccine, was to remove free Covid PCR tests because they'd previously been free.
[03:48:45.493 --> 03:48:46.815]  Now people have to pay for them.
[03:48:46.815 --> 03:48:51.839]  They're not going to be able to afford to pay for them because France's economy's basically been in the mud for the past 15 years.
[03:48:53.228 --> 03:49:04.402]  So make it financially unsustainable for most people to continually have to take negative Covid tests to go about daily activities, so they will be forced to take the vaccine.
[03:49:04.402 --> 03:49:05.844]  But it's not mandatory.
[03:49:06.579 --> 03:49:19.023]  CNN doctor, it needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated, and medical experts suggested that in order to force more people to get vaccinated, life should be made as difficult as possible for those who are still opting not to take the shots.
[03:49:19.023 --> 03:49:31.848]  That's what it's all about, identifying the dissidents who don't go along with this, so they can be punished by having their basic social life, their right to mobility, and everything that constitutes normal, free living, removed.
[03:49:32.412 --> 03:49:33.035]  Gonna wrap it up.
[03:49:33.035 --> 03:49:34.160]  Summit.News coming up next.
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:35.726]  War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:49:35.726 --> 03:49:36.188]  Don't go away.
