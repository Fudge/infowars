[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.802]  Since I was a very little boy, I was fascinated with history.
[00:00:24.642 --> 00:00:38.987]  And my dad, particularly, my mom some as well, would take me on Saturdays and Sundays and sometimes on weeknights to the Dallas Library or to the Garland Library or the Rockwall Library or different little libraries because I wanted to look at books.
[00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.249]  And my favorite books were always historical books.
[00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.210]  I wanted to look up the Romans and the Vikings.
[00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.491]   I wanted to study The Mongols, and I wanted to know about ancient China, and I wanted to know about the Aztecs.
[00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:54.472]  And so over time, I really became somewhat of a history buff.
[00:00:55.852 --> 00:01:02.654]  But I've also been fascinated with people's family names, their last names, because there's always so much history in that.
[00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:20.860]   And yesterday, I was sitting there thinking about how horrible Anthony Fauci is, and all the terrible things he did back in the 1980s, Covering up what was happening with HIV and blocking good drugs that were treating people almost 100% effectiveness while giving people things like AZT that actually killed him.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.844]  That's why Magic Johnson got on AZT at Fauci's recommendation and got off of it because it almost killed him and he's alive today and so many others listened to Fauci and died.
[00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:40.746]   He was the one that did that and Oh, he recommended Rendezivir with the Communist Chinese government a year and a half ago, and it killed 50 plus percent of the people that took it with organ failure, mainly the kidneys.
[00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:50.394]  So I was thinking, man, I wonder what his family name means, because usually that's associated with the type of family you were and traits that kept showing up in families, or the type of jobs you did.
[00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:57.240]  So I looked up the Fauci family name, and guess what the Fauci family name means?
[00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.762]  It means the sickle.
[00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:01.304]  You know what the Grim Reaper carries?
[00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:02.585]  And I went, you know, that's funny.
[00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:05.527]  I studied the 14th century Black Plague.
[00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:07.688]  Read four or five books of it over the years.
[00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.229]  Watched documentaries about it.
[00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.250]  It's very fascinating.
[00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.391]  Changed the whole course of our civilization.
[00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:16.994]  And there are groups of globalists that want to create a new plague, they believe.
[00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.776]  It'll wipe out most of the people and create a new renaissance.
[00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.962]  So I thought, let me look up the Fauci family from Italy.
[00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:38.013]  Let me look up Fauci's background because memory was telling me that the Grim Reaper with a sickle came out of Italy in the 14th century and then spread around Europe and then to Russia and other parts of the world.
[00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:39.955]  And sure enough, I looked it up.
[00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:57.402]  The Grim Reaper with his sickle comes from the 14th century, the Black Plague, in Italy, from actually the same region that Fauci's from, and people with the name sickle were then associated with death and the Grim Reaper.
[00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:00.622]  So I've likened him to the Angel of Death.
[00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:04.942]   That was Joseph Mengele in World War II that ran the Nazi eugenics program for the Rockefellers
[00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:10.962]   and IBM that tortured thousands to death himself but also gave the directives that then killed
[00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:12.382]  millions in horrible deaths.
[00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:17.742]   The IBM numbers were put on the Jews' arms and others that was put into the primitive
[00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:21.942]   punch card computers to decide who would live and who would die and how long you'd be allowed
[00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:22.942]  to live.
[00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:29.941]   And then you see Fauci carrying on the Angel of Death's program.
[00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:32.742]  Really he's kind of his protégé spiritually now today.
[00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:38.062]   And to know his name means the sickle and is associated in Italy with the Grim Reaper
[00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:38.621]  and Death.
[00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:48.622]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:40.515 --> 00:03:41.636]  It's really amazing.
[00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:48.400]  Even in his name, not just his actions, Anthony Fauci is the modern angel of death.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.845]  And he attends eugenics conferences with David Rockefeller and Ted Turner and others and has called for depopulation, just like Bill Gates has.
[00:03:55.885 --> 00:04:04.951]  And so it's no wonder Bill Gates has worked with him, because before Bill Gates was even on the scene, 40 plus years ago, Fauci was running secret vaccine programs, illegal testing around the world.
[00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.611]   He didn't just run the modern Wuhan lab that cooked up the coronavirus under his direct
[00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.570]  gain of function orders, which has now come out.
[00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.810]   But the clock is ticking and the walls are closing in and time is running out for Dr.
[00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.411]  Death or Dr. Mingala 2.0.
[00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:24.129]  Let's just call him the little angel of death Fauci.
[00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.911]   I just thought you might want to know some of the strange history surrounding his name
[00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.370]  and where the modern Grim Reaper came from.
[00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.250]   You can go back to Exodus in the Bible and hear about the angel of death, but it wasn't
[00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.771]   until 600 years ago that we got the current Grim Reaper from the same town and region
[00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.730]  that Dr. Fauci now hails from of the same name.
[00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:50.222]   So I'm Alex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com and now you know the rest of the story.
[00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:59.222]   It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:04.325]  You take it under the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:10.370]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.372]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[00:05:12.392 --> 00:05:19.598]  They don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[00:05:19.858 --> 00:05:27.204]  Now we have Winter Sun with Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K that helps it upload better and is also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarStore.com.
