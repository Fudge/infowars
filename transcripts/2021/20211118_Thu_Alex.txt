[00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:27.398]   If it sinks in that we have world government, if it sinks in that it wants to kill us, if it sinks in that Pfizer through the UN and a consortium of banks got governments in an emergency that they staged with Bill Gates and Fauci to give them power secretly over all of our governments, to not just indemnify them but sign over the national parks and military bases to them and had the
[00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:33.078]   government sign on under a secret emergency declaration of martial law, or it is, that they
[00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:39.517]   have a medical tyranny. And that's why whatever Pfizer says they want is then done. And whatever
[00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:47.097]   Bill Gates says is done. Like it was carved in stone. From the front lines of the information
[00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:48.998]  war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:58.996]  [Music]
[00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.518]  Have you heard of this?
[00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:02.784]  Blasts in China, all within a week.
[00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:08.107]  10 explosions, 10 bomb blasts in one country in less than a week.
[00:01:09.348 --> 00:01:16.994]  Between October 21st and October 27th, there were at least 10 mysterious explosions throughout China.
[00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:22.397]  Killing at least 13 people and injuring many more.
[00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:39.241]  These mysterious explosions came just weeks before Xi Jinping was anointed as a revered leader of the CCP, preparing him for next year's CCP Congress, which is scheduled for next October.
[00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:49.794]  This gives Xi less than a year to make good on his commitment to absorb Taiwan into the CCP and unite all of China under communism.
[00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:56.500]  And allowing this to happen would be handing the world economy over to the Communist Chinese.
[00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:09.635]  The CCP deploys massive fishing fleets to illegally plunder protected areas, such as the Galapagos Islands, because they are hungry.
[00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:22.182]  The CCP is undergoing a food shortage crisis, warning people to stock up on essential items, and adopting laws against food waste and binge eating.
[00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:29.212]  The CCP has been buying massive amounts of farmland in Australia and the United States.
[00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:42.404]  Handing over the world economy to the Communist Chinese would be national suicide for both nations, who have already been infiltrated at the highest levels of government by the CCP.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.263]  A handful of Republican Senators visited Taiwan to vow U.S.
[00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:48.783]  support.
[00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:50.124]  The U.S.
[00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:52.946]  Secretary of State has said that the U.S.
[00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.307]  will defend Taiwan.
[00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:59.991]  And Australia's Minister for Defense has vowed to back the U.S.
[00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:02.253]  and Taiwan against China.
[00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:06.596]  But who currently has control over the Australian military?
[00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.391]  Or the U.S.
[00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:08.971]  military.
[00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:16.153]  The CCP's own woke American puppet, General Mark Milley, says that the U.S.
[00:03:16.373 --> 00:03:22.074]  is incapable of defending itself against China's hypersonic missile tech.
[00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:24.195]  PSYOPs.
[00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:28.096]  Something we have all been learning about firsthand.
[00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.176]  Many of us have read how they've done it in history.
[00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:40.814]  But today, we are all witnessing in real time how the banking cartel is capable of orchestrating a world war.
[00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:52.837]  As China's housing giant Evergrande defaults on billions of dollars of debt, Goldman Sachs is busy buying up these garbage assets with U.S.
[00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:53.978]  taxpayer dollars.
[00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:59.082]  Goldman Sachs is bailing out the CCP with U.S.
[00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:04.967]  tax dollars, while the CCP is preparing to wage war against the U.S.
[00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:14.280]  By hook or by crook, the ethos of the communist Chinese is what the bankers want for their world government dream.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:27.366]  Every individual connected to a central bank, controlled by a social credit score, and made to accept endless injections of unknown substances into their body.
[00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:32.706]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reis.
[00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:46.706]  [Intro]
[00:04:46.706 --> 00:05:01.706]  [Music]
[00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:03.445]  InfoWars.
[00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:05.605]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:17.605]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:28.605]  [Music]
[00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:35.851]  Infowars, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:49.060]  All right, I am going to lay out news and information today that is the absolute key to victory and liberty and will save millions of lives and change the entire course of human development.
[00:05:50.143 --> 00:05:52.184]  Everything is now 100% crystal clear.
[00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:54.464]  All the pieces have fallen into place.
[00:05:55.264 --> 00:06:02.264]   And the good news is there's a chain reaction taking place right now that is simply amazing.
[00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:09.122]  And what am I talking about?
[00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:14.249]  Well, this came out actually six months ago.
[00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:19.330]  And we covered it with several guests and we read articles about it and showed documents on air.
[00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:26.900]  But then I saw stories last night that when I first saw it on Twitter, I thought it was a joke.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.242]  But then I went and looked at it, and there it was, the link to the federal court, and it wasn't even in the mainstream news.
[00:06:33.262 --> 00:06:34.922]  They were reporting it like it was no big deal.
[00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:45.785]  And then it reminded me of the documents that leaked in the United States, and the documents that leaked in Brazil, and in the European Union.
[00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.266]  It was over 50 countries signed onto it.
[00:06:48.806 --> 00:07:11.879]   A secret agreement A secret agreement with Pfizer and the United Nations, with billions of dollars of payoff money paid by Bill Gates, that's in the news today too, to the government officials and the media, right down to reporters.
[00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.522]  I mean, small reporters got hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.065]  Big ones, millions.
[00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:25.825]   The numbers are about four He was the bag man for?
[00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:29.027]  I mean, this is just over the top.
[00:07:29.987 --> 00:07:31.869]  And what are the secret agreements say?
[00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:33.810]  Well, we don't have but part of it.
[00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:43.056]  And it puts Pfizer in control of the governments and in the response to COVID and all news and information.
[00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:54.722]  See, you've heard governments can sign treaties with foreign powers, but can those treaties supersede the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
[00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:57.804]  That's been argued by globalists for a hundred years.
[00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:02.846]  That's how they've been pushing the UN and all these bodies that transfer our sovereignty.
[00:08:04.487 --> 00:08:23.904]   But to say that government can contract secretly with a corporation and a consortium of corporations To control information, to control government response, and to not let the public even know what is in a shot for 50 years.
[00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:26.586]  And that's what came out.
[00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:39.436]  A document we didn't know about, but they showed it in federal court and told the federal judge, we want you to seal, because all these lawsuits, all of our secret studies and what's in these shots.
[00:08:39.516 --> 00:08:42.098]  And we want to be able to change what's in them for whenever we want.
[00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:45.353]  I mean, it's just 007 license to kill.
[00:08:46.674 --> 00:08:46.834]  Us.
[00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:51.698]  And the judge is like, yeah.
[00:08:55.041 --> 00:09:00.005]  Hasn't ruled yet, but said, yeah, that's what you've got a contract with Homeland Security and FEMA.
[00:09:00.926 --> 00:09:01.507]  A contract.
[00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:04.910]  And so this is what Trump did to us.
[00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:10.764]  This is what Warp Speed and all this is, and all these other countries signed on to it.
[00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:12.164]  He, of course, didn't read it.
[00:09:12.944 --> 00:09:16.926]  And I remember Trump, about two months ago, did three interviews.
[00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.466]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew to find some.
[00:09:19.227 --> 00:09:19.967]  We played it at the time.
[00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:25.369]  Headline, Trump says Pfizer has more power than governments should be looked at.
[00:09:28.038 --> 00:09:37.428]  And Trump was in a Fox News, he was in a NBC interview, and he was on Newsmax all three times and said, people should really look at Pfizer.
[00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:38.189]  Very interesting.
[00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.672]  I don't think you should have to give people booster shots.
[00:09:40.712 --> 00:09:42.254]  I don't think you should make people take shots.
[00:09:43.522 --> 00:09:48.565]  I'm very interested for people to research that they'll be blown away by how much power Pfizer has.
[00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:56.350]  Because he knows, under the agreements now, that he's just learned what he signed on to, that he didn't read, that it gave them more power than a president.
[00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.030]  In fact, that's what he said.
[00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.272]  He said, Pfizer has more power than the president.
[00:09:59.452 --> 00:10:00.472]  That was one of the quotes.
[00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.233]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:07.336]  Now, that's endearing that Trump woke up and admits he got conned.
[00:10:07.797 --> 00:10:09.298]  But he needs to come out fully against it.
[00:10:10.734 --> 00:10:15.037]  This is so big, ladies and gentlemen, that we've got Mike Cernovich in the studio.
[00:10:15.097 --> 00:10:16.057]  So happy to have him here.
[00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:17.178]  We've got Tim Pool in the studio.
[00:10:17.218 --> 00:10:18.199]  That's going to be amazing today.
[00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:19.219]  I'm going to do all four hours.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.201]  And I'm sure they're going to agree this is a big deal.
[00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.363]  I'm going to get their take on it.
[00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.884]  But do you understand?
[00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:28.045]  This is all we should be talking about.
[00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:28.746]  This.
[00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:36.010]  And that's why the CEO of Pfizer goes on TV and says, I want laws passed to arrest anybody that criticizes Pfizer.
[00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:47.841]   And the European Union and Canada and Australia And click their heels, the UK, click their heels and pass emergency laws.
[00:10:48.041 --> 00:11:01.811]  Well, how do you pass emergency laws to arrest people that criticize lockdowns and forced injections in Croatia, in Austria, in Australia, in Spain?
[00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:06.175]  And the law is about to pass, because they're making it through Parliament, instead of just doing executive power in the UK.
[00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:16.859]  And this guy, like some super villain, you know, beams in to the Atlantic Council, we need to arrest the dark actors that are blocking us.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.961]  And the man goes, yes, of course.
[00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:21.062]  This would be illegal.
[00:11:21.122 --> 00:11:21.702]  Arrest them.
[00:11:23.023 --> 00:11:23.703]  Oh, boy.
[00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.024]  I mean, it's on.
[00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:35.050]  So globalism is a project of getting traders into local government and national government and having them transfer all the power to international bodies.
[00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:43.704]  And the UN is only a segue into corporate fascism and the corporations finally being in direct control of the planet.
[00:11:44.184 --> 00:11:47.026]  And that's been their goals, again, since they set up the UN.
[00:11:47.847 --> 00:11:49.828]  Hell, since they set up the League of Nations, it fell apart.
[00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:53.911]  So this is a hundred-plus-year-old project.
[00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:55.552]  It's over a hundred years, like 104 years old now.
[00:11:57.688 --> 00:11:59.389]  Since it was officially a global project.
[00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:00.530]  I mean, it's really older than that.
[00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.972]  Cecil Rhodes ran the British Empire, and it's really his plan.
[00:12:04.412 --> 00:12:05.793]  And he wrote a bunch of books on it.
[00:12:05.813 --> 00:12:06.354]  You can go read them.
[00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:07.054]  I've read two of them.
[00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:08.895]  So this is a fact.
[00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:14.959]  And oh, by the way, this isn't global government that wants you to have a beautiful planet and a world ID.
[00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:16.140]  We all can go wherever we want.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.303]  No, you're going to be locked in your house and under robot gunpoint.
[00:12:21.488 --> 00:12:22.488]  Under a technocracy.
[00:12:22.528 --> 00:12:26.810]  So, I want to show you these headlines for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll read these for you.
[00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:45.576]  And listen, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, please, for your children, for sanity, go read these articles, get this information, share it with folks, and then share the live view of the show, or take the archive of this when it's on Bandot Video later today, and download it, and share it, and re-upload it, and make a big deal out of it.
[00:12:46.943 --> 00:12:47.443]  So here it is.
[00:12:47.904 --> 00:12:53.408]  FDA asked court for 55 years to fully release Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data.
[00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:57.871]  Just come out that they're killing people and they covered it up and they know it and we've got all the whistleblowers.
[00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:03.836]  So those people can be sued or even arrested if they tell you that they're killing you.
[00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:06.137]  Boy, that sounds like something I want to take.
[00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:08.179]  Okay, so there it is.
[00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:12.402]  FDA asked federal judge to grant it total secrecy until the year 2076.
[00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:17.647]  It's not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:19.848]  Oh, then this little tidbit here.
[00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:28.871]  Revealed, documents show Bill Gates gave $319 million to media outlets, and that's only in one year in just a few countries.
[00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:32.433]  It's $4 billion in the last five years.
[00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.454]  That's why they do whatever he says.
[00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:42.817]  That's why he goes on TV, you know, like your dog you feed, and you snap your fingers and say, sit to get a biscuit, and he snaps his fingers, the media sits.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.828]  He snaps his fingers and says, give children deadly shots, and they push it because they're owned.
[00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.134]  And here it is, now when we come back, I'm going to hit the big news.
[00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:54.880]  Here it is, mainstream news, ABC.net, that's Australia.
[00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:57.078]  Here it is out of the Washington Post.
[00:13:57.098 --> 00:13:58.659]  I mean, they've already told you this in your face.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.963]  Pfizer has power to silence, that's a quote, governments and maximize profits.
[00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.105]  Wow, you can silence governments?
[00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:08.286]  Yeah, like you silence U.S.
[00:14:08.326 --> 00:14:10.167]  Senators when they criticize Pfizer.
[00:14:10.187 --> 00:14:11.628]  You're not allowed to say that on the Senate floor.
[00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:17.352]  In secret vaccine contracts with governments, Pfizer took hard line to push profit.
[00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:19.774]  It's not about profit, it's about control and power.
[00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:31.867]  Pfizer demands governments gamble with state assets to secure vaccine debt and sign over the nations to them in receivership, like you go pay a bond when you're out of jail on a murder charge.
[00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:39.370]  Why would they have signed us onto this just like they had Third World Countries sign onto the IMF and World Bank and be bankrupt forever?
[00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.691]  This is the change going on, baby.
[00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:44.552]  This is world corporate government that wants to kill you.
[00:14:45.392 --> 00:14:50.934]  All right, so here's the big takeaway, and this is the most important thing in the world.
[00:14:52.261 --> 00:14:53.202]  That I'm about to say.
[00:14:54.322 --> 00:15:09.612]  The most important thing in your life, the most important thing in my life, and every person on this planet, if you want to be free.
[00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:14.095]  This isn't just a political issue.
[00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:15.957]  This is an issue that is everything.
[00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:18.318]  This is the new type of war.
[00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:19.319]  This is globalism.
[00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:20.520]  This is their endgame plan.
[00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.011]  It's what they've been working on for a hundred years.
[00:15:25.112 --> 00:15:29.033]  They wanted to establish world government and carry out depopulation over a hundred years ago on record.
[00:15:30.254 --> 00:15:38.337]  Plato, the father of what you'd call philosophy, wanted to establish an empire and kill all the poor people too.
[00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.098]  Not just Malthus 300 years ago.
[00:15:41.238 --> 00:15:43.359]  Not just Galton 170 years ago.
[00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:48.975]   If you don't know who Galton is, if you don't know who Cecil Rhodes is.
[00:15:49.075 --> 00:15:59.077]  If you don't know who Thomas Malthus was, if you don't know who Plato was, you need to learn because these are the governing controllers of your life.
[00:16:00.678 --> 00:16:02.538]  The most important thing spiritually is God.
[00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:03.318]  That's number one.
[00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:19.886]   But when it comes to this planet and what's the whole rest of your life, vaccine checkpoints, robots replacing humans, being injected with poisons till you die, total tyranny, re-education camps, How do they sell those?
[00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:29.171]  Well, vaccine passports and checkpoints and taking people away to the, quote, internment facility for their safety.
[00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:30.812]  That's what this is.
[00:16:30.892 --> 00:16:31.672]  That's the plan.
[00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:36.655]  I told you 21 months ago when this all started that this was all going to be unfolding exactly as it has.
[00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:38.637]  And I told you then there'd be booster shots.
[00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:40.658]  And then they'd say, oh, you've got to take those.
[00:16:42.878 --> 00:16:46.120]  And then they're going to say, oh, we got to arrest all the people that won't take vaccines.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:52.283]  They're the reason everybody keeps getting sick, even though these vaccines erase your immunity and make you sick on record.
[00:16:55.525 --> 00:16:58.187]  And they've got all the nanny state liberal police.
[00:16:59.463 --> 00:17:06.817]  In all of Europe, in Canada, in Australia, in New Zealand, in the UK, and in blue cities in the US that will put you in jail for life.
[00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:10.022]  They want to disappear you and your family.
[00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.767]  They are totally turned over to this.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.491]  You understand they'll do anything they're told.
[00:17:18.511 --> 00:17:26.053]  They'll beat women and children with clubs for going outside to the park when Fauci and Bill Gates created the virus and released it.
[00:17:26.474 --> 00:17:29.615]  And now give you a vaccine that creates the virus in your body.
[00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:40.179]  And no matter how many people die, no matter how evil things get, they are yes men that have decided to follow orders and have decided to rationalize what they're doing.
[00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:42.500]  And so they are capable of anything.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.301]  All right, let me make the big announcement.
[00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:49.583]  What is the big announcement?
[00:17:49.643 --> 00:17:56.709]  Just boil down for everyone so that we can get Rand Paul and Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz on board.
[00:17:56.749 --> 00:17:57.610]  They all know this.
[00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.052]  They all know that if they talk about this, the system comes after them.
[00:18:01.273 --> 00:18:03.394]  They won't just be getting shot at or their ribs broken.
[00:18:03.655 --> 00:18:04.475]  It'll be a lot worse.
[00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:10.260]  But we're all going to lose everything anyways if we don't call out the heart of the matter.
[00:18:11.781 --> 00:18:33.749]   The United States government Along with more than 50 other governments signed an illegal treaty with Pfizer and the United Nations to put our countries into total receivership to them during the emergency if they would give us the drug to save us.
[00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:50.783]  Total censorship control, total secrecy of what's in it, total secrecy of what it does to people, allowed to lie, allowed to put out fake info, allowed to have anyone arrested they want, allowed to censor anybody they want, total global dictatorship.
[00:18:50.803 --> 00:18:53.085]  In fact, get clip 19 ready with Rand Paul.
[00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:55.707]  Rand Paul came out and said Fauci's an authoritarian.
[00:18:56.367 --> 00:19:00.410]  And the way he casually talks about you have no personal rights is serious tyranny.
[00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.312]  Yeah, we're in an authoritarian state.
[00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:10.291]  The big Chinese dissident finally released, it was on PBS, and they said, you know, is it Trump and America authoritarian and bad?
[00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:10.891]  He goes, no.
[00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:12.493]  Trump is not authoritarian.
[00:19:12.513 --> 00:19:13.413]  He doesn't have any power.
[00:19:14.054 --> 00:19:15.475]  The left is like Mao.
[00:19:15.515 --> 00:19:16.415]  They're taking over.
[00:19:16.496 --> 00:19:17.436]  You're in danger.
[00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:21.279]  And she's like, she has no idea.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.841]  No idea that she's walking dead.
[00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:25.282]  No idea.
[00:19:25.342 --> 00:19:26.563]  I mean, folks, this is it.
[00:19:27.403 --> 00:19:27.964]  You understand?
[00:19:28.244 --> 00:19:29.285]  This is it.
[00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:35.408]  And we either man up and expose this, and pull out of these illegal treaties, and arrest these people, or it's over.
[00:19:36.189 --> 00:19:38.550]  Now, other people won't say that, because they'll come after you.
[00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.091]  Listen!
[00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:43.233]  I'm not signing on to billions of dead people in my name!
[00:19:45.495 --> 00:19:54.000]  And all the fools that sit there in the middle of gymnastics that say, I'm the bad guy for fighting these people, you're all gonna see what happens if we're unable to stop this thing.
[00:19:56.178 --> 00:19:57.859]  And why wouldn't they go for broke?
[00:19:57.939 --> 00:19:59.039]  It lets them take over everything.
[00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:00.259]  It lets them depopulate everybody.
[00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:04.021]  It lets them collapse civilization and take all your money and everything through the medical system.
[00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:11.323]  It lets them phase out the majority of the population and roll forward with all the new technologies and systems and life extension for themselves.
[00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:13.364]  And then they just steal the whole future.
[00:20:13.624 --> 00:20:18.386]  And if you want your destiny stolen, and you want your children's future stolen, and all of this, then that's up to you.
[00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:19.646]  But this is real.
[00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:24.330]   And that's why they're fighting like the devil to keep Us off the air.
[00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:29.093]  This is life and death and I'm more than willing to be set up or put in prison or die.
[00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:30.093]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[00:20:30.193 --> 00:20:32.314]  I really don't like it, but I've got to do it.
[00:20:32.414 --> 00:20:32.614]  Okay.
[00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:35.596]  And I'm just telling you, I'm willing to hit the barbed wire.
[00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:38.797]  I'm willing to go in first as a shock troops politically, and I've done that.
[00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:39.517]  Okay.
[00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.318]  And I, cause I knew what was coming.
[00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:42.639]  I knew I tried to stop this.
[00:20:43.139 --> 00:20:49.802]  So listen, look around at your family tonight because in, in, in eight years of their plan successful, those people are all going to be dead.
[00:20:49.842 --> 00:20:50.462]  And so are you.
[00:20:51.143 --> 00:20:51.583]  You're dead.
[00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:52.929]  They're going to kill you.
[00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.075]  They're going to give you shot after shot after shot after shot until society collapses.
[00:20:57.616 --> 00:21:01.481]  And the people with Stockholm Syndrome can't admit they're being killed because it's too scary.
[00:21:01.982 --> 00:21:04.326]  And so, they're going to go along with it.
[00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:05.808]  The argument is they deserve to die.
[00:21:05.828 --> 00:21:07.791]  And I'll be quite frank with you, okay?
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.981]  I could have gone with the New World Order.
[00:21:10.161 --> 00:21:11.803]  I didn't do it because spiritually I can't do it.
[00:21:12.003 --> 00:21:12.863]  But I understand it.
[00:21:13.304 --> 00:21:15.946]  Part of me wants to kill all these people that don't care about themselves.
[00:21:16.206 --> 00:21:17.287]  Okay, you know what?
[00:21:17.347 --> 00:21:17.527]  Fine.
[00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:18.348]  Let's kill all of them.
[00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:19.028]  I'm going to go forward.
[00:21:19.048 --> 00:21:19.489]  I'm going to live.
[00:21:19.709 --> 00:21:24.533]  But I'm not signing on to that because I have an eternal soul and I will be cut off from God if I do that.
[00:21:24.893 --> 00:21:29.217]  But I totally know where Bill Gates and Prince Charles and all of them come from.
[00:21:29.837 --> 00:21:33.039]  I could be in league with them, 100%, be one of their generals.
[00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:35.000]  But I'm not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.401]  And that's what my enemies need to know, that think they're on my level attacking me.
[00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:39.442]  You have no idea.
[00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:40.282]  You're fools.
[00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:45.965]  I am above and transcended above all this worldly crap.
[00:21:46.165 --> 00:21:49.166]  And I know you are as well, viewers and listeners, because you have Christ.
[00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:57.335]  Faith without works is dead, and Christ expects you to pick up the cross and follow Him, and that's what I have to do.
[00:21:57.355 --> 00:22:05.441]  And that doesn't mean I'm going to sit up here and be a cupcake, Mr. Sweetsie preacher who's all perfect and good and tells you about how big a sinner you are.
[00:22:05.862 --> 00:22:07.403]  I'm telling you, God hates cowards.
[00:22:08.023 --> 00:22:14.108]  And if you won't stand up for our children, well then, you deserve to die, and you will.
[00:22:14.989 --> 00:22:16.050]  But very slowly first.
[00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:26.036]  They're going to have you give up everything you are in the social credit score and bow to them so you can just live a little longer as you're being trained by Satan to be a slave.
[00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:29.578]  So not me and not my family.
[00:22:30.197 --> 00:22:33.279]  We commit ourselves to war against these people.
[00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:45.144]  100% I pledge in front of God and His Son Jesus Christ absolute total commitment against this and I ask God to fill me with the Holy Spirit so that I can stand against this enemy and be effective in protecting innocent.
[00:22:45.744 --> 00:22:52.744]   I ask God to give me the strength and the will, humbly, to take on these people.
[00:22:52.744 --> 00:22:59.144]  Now, you need to ask God for guidance.
[00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:01.290]  You need to step into your destiny now.
[00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:07.532]  We're going to come back and cover the most important news in human history, and what we're going under right now.
[00:23:07.672 --> 00:23:10.152]  A worldwide medical extermination system.
[00:23:10.653 --> 00:23:15.451]   Our government is now under Pfizer's complete command and it's illegal.
[00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:24.491]  In the age of wonder.
[00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:27.772]  Another world.
[00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:36.491]  Another time.
[00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.731]  Until the crystal cracked!
[00:23:40.951 --> 00:23:47.951]  until the Atlantean crystal cracked.
[00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:54.711]  The power of their source.
[00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:59.211]  our sheep.
[00:23:59.577 --> 00:24:03.360]  Learn about that from Plato too, but who wants to know what really is going on?
[00:24:07.804 --> 00:24:15.150]  When you can watch Netflix and learn how great pedophilia is by tuning in to CNN.
[00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:19.154]  Yeah, they're all over the news saying pedophilia is a good thing now.
[00:24:19.214 --> 00:24:20.155]  It's the big coming out.
[00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:30.309]  It's okay, they always wear like rainbow colored glasses and stuff, so they're like clowns, you know, that's how they attract the little child into their web.
[00:24:32.292 --> 00:24:36.097]  Okay, listen, it really clicked for me last night and this morning.
[00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:46.424]  When I began to just sit there and read Pfizer telling a federal judge, hey, we've got total agreements that we can tell the government what to do.
[00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:47.565]  Carte blanche.
[00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:49.505]  It's like a get out of jail free card.
[00:24:49.525 --> 00:24:51.066]  It's beyond immunity.
[00:24:51.126 --> 00:24:55.427]  It's they direct the federal government in all vaccine responses.
[00:24:56.367 --> 00:25:04.410]  And so Biden goes, OK, the CDC is now in control of all rents and we're going to be in control of all your bank accounts under the COVID emergency.
[00:25:05.874 --> 00:25:09.235]  And finally, a federal court said, no, you don't have that jurisdiction.
[00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:10.676]  We're not North Korea.
[00:25:12.356 --> 00:25:16.878]  But they're still pushing that because they are engaged in this criminal takeover.
[00:25:16.938 --> 00:25:22.920]  And if we don't say, hey, you're not allowed to sign a secret treaty with Pfizer and the U.N.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.742]  to take over all aspects of the media and the government and be able to, quote, silence the government.
[00:25:27.962 --> 00:25:28.962]  That's in the agreement.
[00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:30.423]  I've got the articles right here.
[00:25:30.683 --> 00:25:33.164]  Just a Washington Post like, oh, they can silence the government.
[00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.547]  It's all about their money.
[00:25:36.267 --> 00:25:39.650]  They then distract off into the 70 billion dollars Pfizer's now made.
[00:25:42.312 --> 00:25:43.572]  That's just side issue.
[00:25:43.592 --> 00:25:45.394]  These people issue and control the currency.
[00:25:45.434 --> 00:25:46.454]  It's a weapon they use.
[00:25:47.315 --> 00:25:48.856]  The tax code is social engineering.
[00:25:49.156 --> 00:25:49.697]  They admit that.
[00:25:50.837 --> 00:25:54.600]  So, this is permanent martial law.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.101]  This is the great reset.
[00:25:57.582 --> 00:25:59.624]  And now they tell you it's the permanent emergency.
[00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:02.846]  Chuckie Schumer was on TV yesterday, and I didn't play the clip.
[00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:04.869]  Dig it up, we will.
[00:26:05.349 --> 00:26:08.211]  But he's just like, hey, things are just going to get worse from global warming.
[00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:12.415]  More deadly viruses, lockdown, society's collapsing, it's just going to get worse.
[00:26:13.175 --> 00:26:15.817]  That's why they're telling everybody, the world ends in 2030.
[00:26:15.898 --> 00:26:17.119]  The world ends.
[00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:18.440]  We're going to die.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.361]  The viruses are going to come out of the jungle.
[00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:22.263]  They're not going to come out of the jungle, folks.
[00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:31.230]  They're going to come out of Fort Detrick, and the University of Texas at Galveston, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and Wuhan, China.
[00:26:33.638 --> 00:26:38.541]  And so they're teaching children in public school all over the world that everybody's gonna be dead in a few years.
[00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:39.401]  It's okay though.
[00:26:40.542 --> 00:26:43.243]  The government's gonna lock us down and maybe some of us will live.
[00:26:43.263 --> 00:26:46.205]  And then here it is.
[00:26:48.026 --> 00:26:53.849]  FDA asked court for 55 years to fully release Pfizer COVID-19 data.
[00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.590]  The epic times.
[00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.231]  The Food and Drug Administration asked a federal judge.
[00:26:58.612 --> 00:27:01.013]  Remember they said safe and approved, safe and effective in 2026.
[00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:10.959]  They've given the vaccine a corporate name, and then they say it might be approved in 2026.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.544]  And now they're like, well, about 2070-something.
[00:27:17.965 --> 00:27:18.586]  I'm not joking.
[00:27:21.308 --> 00:27:28.634]  So you see, I mean, this, this is what it's like when you're in Poland in 1940, and just suddenly Hitler invades and starts blowing everything up.
[00:27:28.714 --> 00:27:37.491]   I mean, or, or, or You own a little shop and a business in 1950 China and the communists have taken over.
[00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:42.116]  They just walk up and shoot your dad and mom in the head and take over your farm and start raping you.
[00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:44.739]  I mean, this is a takeover by bad people.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:51.086]  And so many folks think, well, just run up a white flag and go along with them and they'll be nice to us.
[00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:52.728]  We just are reasonable.
[00:27:55.171 --> 00:28:01.955]  And it reminds me of the Road Warrior, a classic fiction film, but that's how the real world actually works in these warlord areas.
[00:28:02.395 --> 00:28:08.218]  And he comes up with members of their family they've captured tied up on the front of the vehicles and saying, listen...
[00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:15.670]  Just open up the gates, let us in, let us have your big pump, let us have your oil well, and we'll let you go.
[00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.311]  And they're like, no, don't do that!
[00:28:17.331 --> 00:28:18.871]  So they start killing them.
[00:28:20.092 --> 00:28:24.193]  And some of the people inside the fort say, hey, Hugh Mungus is a reasonable man!
[00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:26.113]  Come on, let's let him in!
[00:28:27.994 --> 00:28:31.955]  Because they just can't understand that they're going to have to fight, or they're going to die.
[00:28:31.975 --> 00:28:36.356]  I mean, I'm sorry that's the way this is, okay?
[00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:38.457]  You think I want to go up against these people?
[00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:40.410]  But they're going up against me.
[00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.491]  And again, I'm not signing on with them.
[00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:46.733]  I had the Kissinger Group invite me to New York City to frickin' meet with Henry Kissinger.
[00:28:47.714 --> 00:28:48.834]  Said it in front of my producer.
[00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:54.057]  And that's the only story I can tell you because they didn't say it's off the record.
[00:28:54.157 --> 00:28:56.459]  I've done off-the-record meetings with people.
[00:28:57.793 --> 00:29:01.336]  This is as real as the sun coming up in the morning and setting in the evening.
[00:29:01.896 --> 00:29:07.181]  And people act like this isn't happening, and you're not even being empowered by these people?
[00:29:07.781 --> 00:29:10.683]  I mean, even if you were a psychopath, they're going to kill almost everybody.
[00:29:12.164 --> 00:29:18.189]  No matter how much you work for them or do what they want, they're going to get rid of you in the end, because they don't want anybody around who's competent.
[00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:26.276]  This is a exterminist plan to return the earth to the Garden of Eden in Jeff Bezos's own words.
[00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:37.597]  And if you let these megalomaniacs take over, and Bill Gates is one of the chieftains of it, then you get what you deserve.
[00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:42.701]  But as for me and mine, we're not bowing down to this thing at one bit.
[00:29:44.042 --> 00:29:46.784]  And I'm going to tell you again, folks, here's the headlines.
[00:29:46.924 --> 00:29:49.466]  These headlines all together are incredible.
[00:29:50.906 --> 00:29:57.906]   The FDA asked court for 55 years to fully release Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine data.
[00:29:57.906 --> 00:30:05.406]  Now here's the really important articles.
[00:30:05.406 --> 00:30:15.406]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:13.135]  Pfizer has power to, quote, silence governments.
[00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:13.755]  Let me say that again.
[00:30:14.276 --> 00:30:24.824]  Pfizer has power to silence governments and maximize profits, consumer group alleges.
[00:30:25.385 --> 00:30:26.606]  They don't allege that.
[00:30:28.673 --> 00:30:38.040]  It says, we have total liability protection, and we will take over your government if you don't pay us.
[00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:47.707]  Or if you violate any clause of this, your national parks are ours, and your military bases are ours, and all the U.S.
[00:30:47.747 --> 00:30:49.429]  government patents are now owned by us.
[00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:50.349]  That's what it says.
[00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.331]  On record, you can go read it.
[00:30:54.136 --> 00:30:59.320]  Just what the consumer groups have been able to get through lawsuits and through groups that have had the documents.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.142]  Because, you know, they go into court with these things and say, Your Honor, please have everyone out of there.
[00:31:03.182 --> 00:31:04.783]  This is classified information.
[00:31:05.344 --> 00:31:06.544]  And then they, here's the treaty.
[00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:07.705]  We own the United States.
[00:31:09.746 --> 00:31:10.867]  This is just so incredible.
[00:31:11.748 --> 00:31:13.709]  So that's ABC News out of Australia.
[00:31:13.949 --> 00:31:14.430]  Here's another one.
[00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.390]  This is the Washington Post.
[00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:16.731]  In secret.
[00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:17.552]  Oh, in secret.
[00:31:18.428 --> 00:31:20.069]  Vaccine contracts with governments.
[00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.251]  Pfizer took hard line to push for profit.
[00:31:23.432 --> 00:31:24.452]  That's a red herring.
[00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:31.657]  We know because Brazil released the document, Bolsonaro released the document, and now they want to kill him.
[00:31:32.038 --> 00:31:42.105]  The UN's calling for war crimes, charges against him saying he's killing people, not doing COVID lockdowns, when they're the ones that cooked it up and released it and run the whole thing and did the global lockdown that's killed over 25 million people, starvation.
[00:31:42.445 --> 00:31:44.466]  They're looking at Bolsonaro saying, we want him arrested.
[00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:45.927]  We want war crimes tribunal.
[00:31:46.027 --> 00:31:46.868]  They'll probably get him.
[00:31:48.078 --> 00:31:55.702]  All because he stood up against these people and got hydroxychloroquine and things like Ivermectin to the public and saw through them.
[00:31:58.424 --> 00:32:03.987]  And then he released the documents where it said we will take control of all your government lands, your military bases.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.581]  And we'll direct your government.
[00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:11.743]  Well, that's how the IMF and World Bank do with African countries and Latin American countries, where they come and say, we'll give you a billion dollars.
[00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:12.664]  This is like 30 years ago.
[00:32:13.184 --> 00:32:14.805]  And then, oh, you never paid the interest on it.
[00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:15.965]  Well, you now owe us $30 billion.
[00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.747]  Well, we just get your roads, your infrastructure, everything's ours.
[00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:20.531]  And that's it.
[00:32:21.292 --> 00:32:26.115]  So, again, Pfizer and these big corporations put their people into all the government positions.
[00:32:26.635 --> 00:32:29.717]  They then had those government officials shine on to this illegal crap.
[00:32:29.797 --> 00:32:31.118]  They got Trump to go along with it.
[00:32:31.358 --> 00:32:32.919]  That's Trump's big downfall.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.240]  And now we're under it.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:40.864]  So Trump can push his stupid vaccine all day, but he better come out and say he got set up on this front.
[00:32:41.605 --> 00:32:41.885]  Okay?
[00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:44.247]  We need to put his feet to the fire on this.
[00:32:44.467 --> 00:32:47.689]  This is an illegal corporate treaty selling our country out.
[00:32:48.795 --> 00:32:54.279]  So the crew found two of the three videos that Trump put out a couple months ago.
[00:32:54.299 --> 00:33:03.185]  One on NBC, one on Fox News, another with Newsmax, where he talks about, wow, Pfizer has really got all this power and control.
[00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:05.407]  They really got an incredible relationship with the governments.
[00:33:07.168 --> 00:33:12.091]  But they haven't found the clip, because I know we played it, where he says, yeah, they really got more power than a president does.
[00:33:13.112 --> 00:33:14.853]  But we don't need to hear that from Trump.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.021]  No that, but we will play those clips here in a moment.
[00:33:20.202 --> 00:33:23.063]  Because we have the documents, and I just read you the headlines.
[00:33:24.304 --> 00:33:31.507]  In secret vaccine contracts with governments, Pfizer took hard line to push for profit, report says.
[00:33:31.947 --> 00:33:33.468]  Secret contracts.
[00:33:33.788 --> 00:33:37.650]  Pfizer has the power to silence governments, ABC News reports.
[00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:45.034]  And then there's the full report by the whistleblower groups, and it's really bad.
[00:33:45.294 --> 00:33:50.059]  Now, Pfizer demands governments gamble with state assets to secure a vaccine deal.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.402]  Sign the state assets over.
[00:33:55.144 --> 00:33:56.425]  Mainstream News reporting this.
[00:33:57.406 --> 00:33:59.749]  That's the secret contract.
[00:34:00.751 --> 00:34:15.437]  Pfizer has been accused of bullying Latin American governments into COVID-19 vaccine negotiations and has asked some countries to put up sovereign assets such as the embassy buildings and military bases as a guarantee against the cost of any future legal action the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has revealed.
[00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:18.958]  And it turns out the U.S.
[00:34:19.418 --> 00:34:19.838]  did that.
[00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:25.061]  Pfizer accused of holding some countries ransom.
[00:34:25.421 --> 00:34:25.801]  Oh really?
[00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:28.582]  Yeah, their subsidiaries cooked up the virus and released it.
[00:34:30.732 --> 00:34:30.912]  L.A.
[00:34:30.932 --> 00:34:32.253]  Times, Pfizer, U.S.
[00:34:32.273 --> 00:34:39.536]  signed $5 billion deal for 10 million treatment courses of their new COVID pill that's partially based on ivermectin.
[00:34:40.136 --> 00:34:40.436]  Wow.
[00:34:42.597 --> 00:34:43.877]  And how did they get this done?
[00:34:43.937 --> 00:35:12.436]   Well, Pfizer went around the world and lobbied with billions of dollars, but a consortium of the Rockefeller, Rothschild, Gates, Warren Buffett, Oprah Winfrey gave hundreds of millions, but Buffett and Gates have given over a hundred billion, into a private consortium that then, the Carnegie Endowment and the Ford Endowment and the Rockefeller Brothers Endowment, put in hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:35:12.476 --> 00:35:13.756]  In fact, the number's not known.
[00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.177]  Gates and Buffett, it's up to $200 billion.
[00:35:16.637 --> 00:35:23.199]  But it's tax-exempt money from their companies that they then reinvest in other companies they take over to control the world medical system.
[00:35:25.182 --> 00:35:30.267]  Gates has been thrown out of over 30 countries, including India, for their vaccines, killing people.
[00:35:30.367 --> 00:35:34.190]  And the Pfizer and Moderna shots are not authorized in China, India, you name it.
[00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.152]  No one would ever take this in their right mind.
[00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:43.959]  This is only for us, the Western countries, who are being bombed with the bioweapon.
[00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:52.040]   Now, you understand that I sit here and have discussions with former head of defense intelligence, And I'll leave it at that.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.721]  Other military and intelligence folks that are patriots.
[00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.422]  But not just Flynn.
[00:35:57.042 --> 00:36:00.865]  And we have straight up conversations about this and talk about this and agree that's what's going on.
[00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:03.986]  Interviewed Flynn, aired it yesterday, talking about the same thing.
[00:36:04.487 --> 00:36:05.127]  This is real.
[00:36:05.547 --> 00:36:15.633]  This is not a comic book or in-game or Marvel stuff and you go eat popcorn and have milk duds and eat a hot dog and everybody's battling and laser beams and everything.
[00:36:15.933 --> 00:36:17.294]  You're being murdered, okay?
[00:36:17.514 --> 00:36:17.914]  Got that?
[00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:18.354]  Okay.
[00:36:21.039 --> 00:36:22.820]  I'm asking you, what are you going to do about this?
[00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:25.222]  Now, now, Rand Paul's finally getting there.
[00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:34.529]  He's saying, hey, this is authoritarian, this is tyranny, this is bad, this is... And now you notice they're like, oh, they're booster shots, they're being authorized, and you gotta take them.
[00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:35.991]  And your children gotta take them.
[00:36:36.351 --> 00:36:38.352]  You know, that's the same thing in Australia, same thing in Israel.
[00:36:38.593 --> 00:36:39.693]  It's all coming here.
[00:36:40.434 --> 00:36:44.077]  They're just further steps down the pit.
[00:36:45.338 --> 00:36:46.739]  They're further down the hellhole.
[00:36:48.294 --> 00:36:50.699]  And so we've got to get this information to Congress.
[00:36:51.701 --> 00:36:52.763]  I don't want the attention.
[00:36:52.863 --> 00:36:55.989]  I don't even want the credit for people making a big deal out of this.
[00:36:57.085 --> 00:37:03.487]  But we need to see OAN and Newsmax and Tucker Carlson and everybody focused on this.
[00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:15.672]  Because this is the World Government Treaty, this is the corporate illegal treaties, agreements, that are secret, that are doing all this, and we need Congress to stop putting up with the censorship and the control and everything.
[00:37:16.472 --> 00:37:19.433]  But you see, Congress knows the biggest spenders.
[00:37:21.727 --> 00:37:25.170]  Our big tech and big pharma, they've bought off most of them.
[00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:35.000]  And that's really what's going on here, is that most of them, I was reading like 87% of Congress takes big pharma money and big tech money.
[00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:37.342]  And pull those numbers up, they vary.
[00:37:37.723 --> 00:37:45.991]  But in the high 70s, low 80s, in both demographics of big tech money versus pharma money, which by the way, those companies are all been merging for a decade at least.
[00:37:47.045 --> 00:37:56.111]  So this is a big corporate, one giant corporate world government monster who wants global government so it can then carry out depopulation.
[00:37:57.012 --> 00:38:05.078]  So again, if this was just a group taking over and they built better roads and, you know, we're better managers and everything, and we're into personal freedom, I'm like, well, the world's coming together.
[00:38:05.598 --> 00:38:06.559]  This is not what they're doing.
[00:38:07.279 --> 00:38:08.840]  They want us gone.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.582]  They see us as an infestation.
[00:38:10.982 --> 00:38:13.804]  And I've got to tell you, if you don't wake up and say out of this, you deserve to die.
[00:38:15.023 --> 00:38:19.533]  I'm not saying that meanly, but this is really a IQ test that's going on.
[00:38:19.874 --> 00:38:20.535]  Here's Senator Paul.
[00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:23.642]  Well, alarming.
[00:38:23.742 --> 00:38:27.725]  I mean, alarming, one, that he has such casual disdain for individual liberty.
[00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:33.288]  But if you combine that with also a casual disdain for science, boy, we got a real problem.
[00:38:33.329 --> 00:38:36.311]  An authoritarian who also doesn't obey the science.
[00:38:36.711 --> 00:38:37.371]  I mean, look at this.
[00:38:37.471 --> 00:38:39.953]  Over 100 million Americans have had COVID.
[00:38:40.433 --> 00:38:43.495]  And if you ask the CDC, well, how do these people react?
[00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:45.057]  The people have had COVID and recovered.
[00:38:45.397 --> 00:38:46.758]  How often do they get sick again?
[00:38:46.818 --> 00:38:48.539]  Do they spread the disease very well?
[00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:49.760]  Oh, we don't know.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.021]  We don't keep track of that.
[00:38:51.801 --> 00:38:52.742]  Can you imagine?
[00:38:52.782 --> 00:38:53.803]  The guy's in charge of this.
[00:38:53.843 --> 00:38:55.964]  We pay him more than anybody in the government.
[00:38:56.324 --> 00:39:00.928]  He has casual disdain for the Bill of Rights and your liberty, but he's not keeping track.
[00:39:00.968 --> 00:39:03.950]  He's like, CNN asked him one day, what do you think about natural immunity?
[00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.771]  He's like, oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:06.912]  We should look into that.
[00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:09.894]  As if it was the first time he's ever heard of it.
[00:39:10.395 --> 00:39:13.037]  He's a liar, and he lies about the natural immunity.
[00:39:13.077 --> 00:39:13.977]  He knows it works.
[00:39:14.198 --> 00:39:17.500]  This is a recipe for totalitarianism.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.622]  It's a recipe for something we don't want in our country.
[00:39:20.522 --> 00:39:22.143]  Well, I mean, it's not a recipe.
[00:39:22.563 --> 00:39:24.944]  They cooked the dinner and we were what they cooked.
[00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:30.627]  I mean, they're attacking us like a tiger grabbing a deer in the forest and ripping its head off.
[00:39:30.687 --> 00:39:33.929]  I mean, the jaws are biting into our arteries right now.
[00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.571]  We have to stop playing patty cake.
[00:39:39.012 --> 00:39:46.676]  But the globalists are real good at leaving the senators insulated and they go home and watch their Fox Sports and everything's okay.
[00:39:46.776 --> 00:39:48.457]  Meanwhile, these people are hardcore killers.
[00:39:50.496 --> 00:39:51.716]  All right, a couple things here.
[00:39:51.736 --> 00:39:55.878]  We got Mike Cernovich, who's a really smart guy, and I'm a big fan of his work.
[00:39:55.918 --> 00:39:59.659]  He's going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour, co-hosting for an hour and a half with us.
[00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:04.680]  And then Tim Poole's coming in in the fourth hour, and I'll be co-hosting with him as well.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.561]  There's some more surprises and things coming up here in the next 48 hours on air.
[00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:11.822]  And then Saturday, there'll be some interesting things going on at InfoWars.
[00:40:12.322 --> 00:40:15.143]  But let me just make this completely clear to everybody.
[00:40:17.734 --> 00:40:19.255]  They're not going to get their full agenda through.
[00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:25.477]  Their full agenda is very expansive, and they've bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:40:26.078 --> 00:40:29.679]  But they are attempting it because they don't feel like there's any consequences.
[00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:35.561]  And so why shouldn't they just kill a bunch of people and get more money and power, and then work towards their ultimate goal of killing 90%?
[00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:41.404]  I don't think they're going to get to that by 2030, but these are psychos that are in control of our lives saying that.
[00:40:41.464 --> 00:40:55.368]   So I just want to remind everybody that They're using serious psychological warfare programs developed by behavioral psychologists and tested out by the CIA and others for a long time against us.
[00:40:55.448 --> 00:40:59.189]  But if you're aware of these tactics, you can completely break free from it.
[00:40:59.629 --> 00:41:06.090]  I instinctively did it without even researching all this 30 years ago, but in the last 20 plus, I have researched it.
[00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:10.931]  And nobody ever really gets into MKUltra, MKNaomi documents and things like that.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:19.181]  Part of what we're doing with Reset Wars that's going to launch in the first week of December, just coming up here in about a week and a half or so.
[00:41:20.628 --> 00:41:25.988]   is we really dissect different schools of mind control and how they're being used,
[00:41:25.988 --> 00:41:30.387]   and then just teach you basic tricks to really unlock yourself from the matrix.
[00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:35.327]   And it's going to be a course, and it's going to be one of many courses
[00:41:35.327 --> 00:41:39.167]   that are very well done and very powerful and very, very groundbreaking.
[00:41:39.167 --> 00:41:44.268]   And if you want to learn about it first, and if you want to get sent videos and free reports
[00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:47.548]   and a lot of things we're going to do that go along with the main course,
[00:41:47.527 --> 00:41:55.714]  You want to go to resetwars.com and put in your email and you will get alerts and things and special videos and reports for free.
[00:41:56.215 --> 00:42:00.699]  And you'll also get a discount for 48 hours before it comes out.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.521]  And we haven't set a day yet in December.
[00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:06.604]  It'll be in the first week of December.
[00:42:06.644 --> 00:42:07.625]  So resetwars.com.
[00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:15.693]  Very easy, and this is powerful information you're definitely going to want to share and be involved in.
[00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:17.715]  ResetWars.com, one word.
[00:42:18.115 --> 00:42:19.756]  Separately, it's time to get prepared.

[00:42:35.308 --> 00:42:35.909]  It's quality.

[00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.535]  Very similar to the last toothpaste, but just reformulated and even more concentrated.
[00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:10.756]  And that keeps us on the air.

[00:43:51.355 --> 00:43:53.296]  And the calls are free when folks call you.

[00:44:03.042 --> 00:44:04.683]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:07.124]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[00:44:06.943 --> 00:44:14.384]   Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[00:44:14.384 --> 00:44:20.264]   You know, we've got some interesting call written house news and we've got the clip.
[00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:21.145]  We'll play it here in a moment.
[00:44:22.185 --> 00:44:25.306]  And yeah, I knew about this 45 minutes ago, and I didn't cover it.
[00:44:26.367 --> 00:44:27.467]  I think Kyle's really important.
[00:44:27.547 --> 00:44:30.568]  I think it's a big case point example for the right to self-defense.
[00:44:31.909 --> 00:44:38.271]  But you understand, we're under a global world government coup, and the documents are out that our government was signed over by Trump to Pfizer.
[00:44:39.184 --> 00:44:44.291]  And I understand that they would tear up executive orders, Trump did, and they'd put things in front of him and 40,000 page bills.
[00:44:44.792 --> 00:44:45.573]  I don't blame Trump.
[00:44:45.993 --> 00:44:51.581]  He's come out and talked about five years of control over the government and that, you know, it's not a good thing and said the booster shots are a scam for profit.
[00:44:51.942 --> 00:45:03.239]   He's starting to eat around the edges of this, but if he comes out, And really starts getting into Pfizer and how they have control of the government and these things.
[00:45:03.939 --> 00:45:07.521]  Then we got a real chance of Congress standing up and doing something.
[00:45:07.541 --> 00:45:15.324]  But if we just elect a bunch of Republicans that do the same old thing, then we're just giving ourselves kind of a painkiller before we shoot ourself.
[00:45:15.804 --> 00:45:17.545]  Might as well just not take the painkiller.
[00:45:17.565 --> 00:45:18.446]  You're going to be dead anyways.
[00:45:19.146 --> 00:45:21.307]  It's like this new governor in Virginia.
[00:45:22.614 --> 00:45:23.816]  Former head of the Carlisle Group.
[00:45:23.856 --> 00:45:25.759]  That's a pretty evil globalist organization.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.062]  I looked at his past, his background.
[00:45:28.102 --> 00:45:31.867]  Other than that, he seems like a nice family man, you know, basketball player, the rest of it.
[00:45:32.248 --> 00:45:38.176]  Looks like he was a front man at, if that doesn't look like him, and we know he was at the Stigl.
[00:45:38.917 --> 00:45:44.599]  Like Ted's on a board, they had two CEOs, so he was like a front man.
[00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:49.061]  But that's just as bad if he was evil, because it just means he does what he's told.
[00:45:50.261 --> 00:45:58.424]  And so yeah, he looks like just a front man, you know, big seven foot tall front man, and kind of toddle around and tell people, you know, that everything's fine.
[00:45:59.044 --> 00:46:06.367]  He says he's gonna let the Democrats run mandates and terrorize kids with face masks and vaccine mandates in the cities.
[00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.470]  It's terrible.
[00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.571]  So yeah, there's been a big development in the Rittenhouse case.
[00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:13.571]  I'll cover it next segment.
[00:46:14.811 --> 00:46:20.132]  Where of course MSNBC is following the jurors around to their houses and harassing them.
[00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:21.113]  They've been banned from the building.
[00:46:22.533 --> 00:46:23.613]  That's what the media does.
[00:46:24.493 --> 00:46:26.914]  That's, I mean, they lie so much.
[00:46:26.934 --> 00:46:31.715]  I mean, I've known they're big liars for a long time, but I mean, they really lie.
[00:46:31.735 --> 00:46:33.155]  I mean, you understand folks.
[00:46:34.022 --> 00:46:39.586]  In the default judgments against us in Texas and in Connecticut, we gave them everything.
[00:46:40.627 --> 00:46:41.488]  And they just say we didn't.
[00:46:43.229 --> 00:46:47.732]  And then they defaulted Owen, who was never subpoenaed or never even called.
[00:46:47.752 --> 00:46:48.933]  I mean, that's a separate person.
[00:46:51.315 --> 00:46:54.237]  And they, I mean, under law, you just don't do that.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:01.361]  It'd be like if you walked into a court and the judge says, you're guilty, you don't get a jury, I am the queen of the earth.
[00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:02.602]  You'd be like, you're a crazy person.
[00:47:02.622 --> 00:47:03.922]  But they just do it now.
[00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:09.764]  And so, people ask me, you know, how I'm handling this.
[00:47:09.944 --> 00:47:13.085]  And I mean, everything's going to hell.
[00:47:13.685 --> 00:47:16.066]  Not just people attacking us, of course they're attacking us.
[00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:24.086]   I mean, Owen Schroer got a good lawyer, is fighting, they're trying to put him in jail
[00:47:24.086 --> 00:47:27.367]   for several years for being at the Capitol, not even in it, with us.
[00:47:27.367 --> 00:47:33.206]   And the feds filed against our filing and said, "He's perjured himself, he was not with Alex Jones."
[00:47:33.206 --> 00:47:36.487]  That's security that day, there was a not for Owen.
[00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:42.846]   And Owen knocked over barricades and trampled signs and the police told Owen to go, but he didn't.
[00:47:42.846 --> 00:47:45.726]  And then they source video that shows the opposite.
[00:47:45.726 --> 00:47:51.967]   And you're sitting there reading federal filings saying we're lying and we have the damn video.
[00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:56.007]  And people go to the URLs they link and they watch it.
[00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:56.435]  It's on Banned Out Video.
[00:47:56.455 --> 00:47:57.235]  That's in the federal filings.
[00:47:57.556 --> 00:47:58.676]  And you watch the opposite.
[00:48:00.497 --> 00:48:04.520]  And you just ask yourself, what is the exercise of lying like that?
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.041]  Well, it's making him have a jury trial.
[00:48:08.743 --> 00:48:14.006]  And if the judges act like he hadn't done something, the judge will probably instruct the jury to convict him.
[00:48:15.015 --> 00:48:17.296]  I mean, the judge will probably not even let him show the video!
[00:48:17.336 --> 00:48:20.418]  That's what I'm... I mean, you see the Rittenhouse judge?
[00:48:20.438 --> 00:48:21.699]  That's a real judge.
[00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:23.439]  And judges used to see him on court TV.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.160]  They all acted like that, pretty much.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.641]  I've never seen stuff like this.
[00:48:27.342 --> 00:48:29.223]  I mean, this is crazy town, folks.
[00:48:29.843 --> 00:48:31.364]  Total crazy town.
[00:48:32.684 --> 00:48:37.567]  So Kyle's very important because if they're able to burn him, they can burn everybody for defending themselves.
[00:48:37.707 --> 00:48:39.808]  I'm just saying, compared to everything else, though?
[00:48:41.629 --> 00:48:42.089]  I mean, look.
[00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:51.140]  A lot of folks that watch on television ask, why do you have a dagger?
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:56.364]  And it's actually a reproduction of what they would use in the Middle Ages.
[00:48:57.144 --> 00:48:59.546]  The knights would have several spike daggers.
[00:49:00.106 --> 00:49:03.148]  They would have a hammer, and you'd hammer it through once you got someone off their horse.
[00:49:03.768 --> 00:49:05.669]  You'd hammer it through their chest into their heart.
[00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.011]  And so that's what that is, is a heart spike.
[00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.193]  And it's a human skull, a real, real skull.
[00:49:11.213 --> 00:49:11.974]  My dad's a physician.
[00:49:11.994 --> 00:49:12.854]  It's my dad's skull.
[00:49:13.214 --> 00:49:13.975]  He had medical school.
[00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:16.347]  It's from India.
[00:49:16.627 --> 00:49:19.109]  Back when that was one of their main exports was skeletons.
[00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.431]  You know, used to in classrooms, it was real skeletons.
[00:49:21.872 --> 00:49:27.637]  And then that those angel wings standard there, what does that symbolize?
[00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:32.141]  And if we can, we'll put that back on screen to show some of the viewers out there.
[00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:34.443]  What does that symbolize?
[00:49:35.704 --> 00:49:53.173]   Well, I was in a Cemetery for some of my ancestors that died in the Indian Wars in the 1820s on a hill on the ranch next door to ours, because we sold that property a long time ago to the neighbor's family about 80 years ago.
[00:49:53.373 --> 00:49:56.335]  But they let us go across the property of the hill to our cemetery.
[00:49:56.835 --> 00:50:05.761]  And up there, there was, there's a, most of the stones have worn away, but you can see a skull with wings on it.
[00:50:06.846 --> 00:50:12.034]  And so, I remember seeing that when I was a kid visiting that cemetery.
[00:50:13.136 --> 00:50:16.762]  And like a third of the graves that you can read say, you know, killed by Indians.
[00:50:18.047 --> 00:50:18.807]  It's pretty wild.
[00:50:20.148 --> 00:50:22.168]  Some rough folks fighting the Comanches.
[00:50:22.428 --> 00:50:23.129]  Pretty cool.
[00:50:23.169 --> 00:50:24.149]  You're like your ancestors.
[00:50:24.169 --> 00:50:27.090]  You realize they were like fighting and dying just to carve out something.
[00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.431]  And most of the graves are under five-year-old dead children.
[00:50:30.511 --> 00:50:32.691]  Some of them killed by the peaceful Native Americans.
[00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:33.892]  I'm not attacking Native Americans.
[00:50:33.932 --> 00:50:34.692]  I'm part Native American.
[00:50:34.712 --> 00:50:35.912]  Just give me a break, folks.
[00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:36.773]  See a movie like The Revenant?
[00:50:36.953 --> 00:50:37.793]  That's based on a true story.
[00:50:38.113 --> 00:50:39.353]  That's what's going on, okay?
[00:50:40.234 --> 00:50:48.285]   So, I saw that carved on One of my ancestors' graves.
[00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:51.688]  And I thought, I want to know what that means.
[00:50:51.728 --> 00:50:56.132]  So I went and search-engined it, and sure enough, it goes back over a thousand years in medieval Europe.
[00:50:57.053 --> 00:51:00.416]  The symbol of, you've died, but your spirit is eternal.
[00:51:00.756 --> 00:51:05.020]  It's a symbol of death, and then transcending into the next dimension.
[00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:08.117]  Or transferring into another form of energy.
[00:51:08.877 --> 00:51:13.119]  And so I thought, that's really, I think, what my symbol should be.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.462]  I don't like that, though, because a lot of people that want to act like they're powerful and mean and stuff want to kind of use that.
[00:51:18.482 --> 00:51:19.782]  They've expropriated that symbol.
[00:51:20.082 --> 00:51:28.326]  Like the Hells Angels, and I'm not attacking the Hells Angels, I'm just saying, I don't have the skull and wings because, you know, we're death riding down the road on our motorcycles, the angel of death.
[00:51:28.566 --> 00:51:28.726]  No.
[00:51:29.727 --> 00:51:37.007]   None of the, this, this meaning is about The transcendence of death and the fact that we are eternal beings.
[00:51:37.067 --> 00:51:43.368]  That's what that symbol means and that's on my ancestors grave and I'm sure it's on many of my other ancestors graves in Europe.
[00:51:43.929 --> 00:51:49.310]  But if you go to Europe and go to any really ancient graveyard, that's on most of the tombstones.
[00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:50.770]  That's the symbol.
[00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.451]  And I think it's a very beautiful symbol.
[00:51:55.508 --> 00:51:57.708]  angel wings, the standard.
[00:51:57.708 --> 00:51:59.508]  It's like a Roman standard, but it's an angel.
[00:51:59.508 --> 00:52:02.948]   And then you've got the dagger, you've got what the enemy threatens us with,
[00:52:02.948 --> 00:52:05.148]  and the fact that death will come.
[00:52:05.148 --> 00:52:07.508]  The dagger's the angel of death.
[00:52:07.508 --> 00:52:14.948]   And the skull is just a very beautiful remnant of our experience in this dimension.
[00:52:14.948 --> 00:52:17.268]  And then you've got the transcendence.
[00:52:17.268 --> 00:52:19.268]  And so that's what it is.
[00:52:19.203 --> 00:52:20.324]  The dagger is the angel of death.
[00:52:21.184 --> 00:52:23.526]  The skull represents humanity and our ancestors.
[00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:27.269]  And the wings that we are connected to the eternal and are eternal.
[00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:28.410]  It's very beautiful.
[00:52:28.891 --> 00:52:29.371]  And you know what?
[00:52:29.451 --> 00:52:30.672]  I'm taking that as my symbol.
[00:52:31.493 --> 00:52:34.295]  InfoWars' symbol is the skull and wings.
[00:52:35.216 --> 00:52:35.777]  That's our symbol.
[00:52:36.497 --> 00:52:38.799]  That's the symbol the Holy Spirit tells me we're supposed to use.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.161]  That is our symbol right there.
[00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.243]  And that's what we stand for.
[00:52:43.823 --> 00:52:44.424]  That's who we are.
[00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:46.757]  We know there's an angel of death.
[00:52:47.017 --> 00:52:47.917]  We know death's coming.
[00:52:48.518 --> 00:52:53.420]  But we live through our ancestors and through our progeny in this dimension and we are eternal on the other planes.
[00:52:54.521 --> 00:53:02.745]  And the enemy hates that because they know that's the truth and they want to try to bind us and enslave us and not let us realize who we really are.
[00:53:03.505 --> 00:53:08.748]  And Reset Wars is all about exposing that and fighting that and saying no to that.
[00:53:10.569 --> 00:53:12.210]  Okay, I got some written house news here.
[00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:15.370]  It's important, but I'm just going to say this again.
[00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:25.110]   If it sinks in that we have world government, if it sinks in that it wants to kill us, if
[00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.590]   it sinks in that Pfizer through the UN and a consortium of banks got governments in an
[00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:35.231]   emergency that they staged with Bill Gates and Fauci to give them power secretly over
[00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:41.570]   all of our governments to not just indemnify them but sign over the national parks and
[00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:46.110]   military bases to them and have the government sign on under a secret emergency declaration
[00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:51.110]  of martial law, or it is, that they have a medical tyranny.
[00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:55.230]  And that's why whatever Pfizer says they want is then done.
[00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:58.110]  And whatever Bill Gates says is done.
[00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:07.710]  Like it was carved in stone.
[00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:08.791]  And so that's the big issue.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.460]  Everything else flows from that.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.460]  We are under a coup.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.620]  It's not the Chinese.
[00:54:12.861 --> 00:54:13.801]  It's not the Russians.
[00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:17.082]  It's the Hollywood, basically.
[00:54:17.242 --> 00:54:29.345]  The anti-Christian, globalist, materialistic, French Revolution 2.0, Bolshevik Revolution 2.0, absolute cancer.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.200]  That's really what it comes down to.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.501]  And I'm just going to be hammering this and hammering this and hammering this.
[00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:40.202]  And I know why the other leaders don't do it, because you do this, they come after you.
[00:54:40.222 --> 00:54:41.482]  But you got to do this.
[00:54:42.783 --> 00:54:43.783]  You got to do this, don't you?
[00:54:44.503 --> 00:54:48.964]  So let's get to the Rittenhouse thing.
[00:54:50.545 --> 00:54:51.985]  We know jurors are getting threatened.
[00:54:52.025 --> 00:54:52.885]  It's all over the news.
[00:54:53.245 --> 00:54:54.226]  There's all over online.
[00:54:55.006 --> 00:54:59.207]  The media is trying to out who they are, MSNBC is, because they're a terrorist organization.
[00:55:00.499 --> 00:55:05.283]  So that they can be terrorized, and a lot of people are cowards, and go ahead and convict Rittenhouse.
[00:55:05.643 --> 00:55:07.064]  It's not a good sign for Rittenhouse.
[00:55:07.144 --> 00:55:08.766]  I mean, you look at it, you think he should be found not guilty.
[00:55:08.986 --> 00:55:11.368]  The fact they've been deliberating now for a couple days is not good.
[00:55:12.048 --> 00:55:12.429]  Not good.
[00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.591]  It means they got people on that jury that are SJWs.
[00:55:16.432 --> 00:55:17.573]  And they want to send Kyle to prison.
[00:55:19.218 --> 00:55:22.580]  That's going to get overturned on appeal because they cheated so much to do this, but it's amazing.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:30.723]  So the judge, the police caught MSNBC following them to their houses and the guy that got arrested by the police said, hey, I was told to do this.
[00:55:31.403 --> 00:55:33.504]  Well, that's OK then, you know, just following orders.
[00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:35.605]  And so now they're barred from the courthouse.
[00:55:35.645 --> 00:55:35.985]  Here it is.
[00:55:38.687 --> 00:55:47.891]  A person who identified himself as James G. Morrison and who claimed that he was a producer with NBC News.
[00:55:50.026 --> 00:56:01.689]  Employed for MSNBC and under the supervision of a person... What's going on?
[00:56:03.424 --> 00:56:04.944]  Oh, okay.
[00:56:05.004 --> 00:56:11.227]  Under the supervision of someone named Irene Bayan in New York for MSNBC.
[00:56:13.088 --> 00:56:30.276]  The police, when they stopped him because he was following at a distance of about a block and went through a red light, pulled him over and inquired of him what was going on and he gave that information and stated that he had been instructed by Ms.
[00:56:30.316 --> 00:56:30.536]  Bayan.
[00:56:32.384 --> 00:56:35.825]  In New York to follow the jury bus.
[00:56:37.805 --> 00:56:41.466]  The matter is under further investigation at this point.
[00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:45.507]  And the media has asked questions about it.
[00:56:45.567 --> 00:56:47.228]  That's the latest I have.
[00:56:50.649 --> 00:56:54.950]  And he was ticketed for violating a traffic control signal.
[00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.110]  He's not here today from what I'm told.
[00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:08.565]   And I have instructed that no one from MSNBC News will be permitted in this building for the duration of this trial.
[00:57:09.706 --> 00:57:29.522]  This is a very serious matter and I don't know what the ultimate truth of it is, but absolutely it would go without much thinking that someone who is following the jury bus, that is a very extremely serious matter.
[00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:36.500]  And he's gone on to say what the whole media is doing is extremely scary yesterday.
[00:57:37.701 --> 00:57:44.485]  And again, the President of the United States said Rittenhouse is a white supremacist because he didn't want them burning down his dad's house and business.
[00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:53.271]  You have an instinct to, hey, people are trying to burn down my dad's business and burn, you know, they're burning stuff down two blocks from my dad's house.
[00:57:54.091 --> 00:57:58.474]  I'm going to drive 20 miles to my dad's house from my mom's house and I'm going to try to help people.
[00:57:59.034 --> 00:58:00.035]  Oh, well, you don't do that.
[00:58:00.335 --> 00:58:01.736]  You're not a convicted pedophile.
[00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:06.154]  Running around screaming the N-word everywhere and attacking people and burning up.
[00:58:06.194 --> 00:58:07.416]  Listen, you're a bad man.
[00:58:07.436 --> 00:58:08.057]  You're going to president.
[00:58:08.077 --> 00:58:12.223]  We're going to have some candy-ass George Soros lawyer try to put you there.
[00:58:13.595 --> 00:58:20.058]  Let me just say this, I want to thank the listeners who have been supporting us over the years, buying the products, spreading the word.
[00:58:20.858 --> 00:58:23.539]  Really, you've helped forge the tip of the spear in the fight.
[00:58:23.679 --> 00:58:30.962]  And it's not about bragging, it's about recognizing your accomplishments, and our accomplishments, and this crew's accomplishments, and what we've done here.
[00:58:31.263 --> 00:58:33.924]  So, we've definitely given the Globalists a run for their money.
[00:58:33.964 --> 00:58:35.424]  They're in a lot of trouble because of us.
[00:58:36.305 --> 00:58:39.666]  They actually would like to kill me, obviously, but they don't want to turn me into a martyr.
[00:58:40.406 --> 00:58:41.267]  But they're thinking about it.
[00:58:42.358 --> 00:58:45.179]  And so this is a very historic time to be alive right now.
[00:58:46.139 --> 00:58:48.339]  And we need to stay on air.
[00:58:49.239 --> 00:59:04.502]  And they have had the Democratic Party-funded groups, the same law firm that sued Remington into bankruptcy, the oldest gun company in America that mainly supplies our military, bankrupted them with their suits and the kangaroo courts and everything.
[00:59:04.542 --> 00:59:05.162]  That's what they do.
[00:59:06.202 --> 00:59:10.743]  When they know how to pick the court and the people, and that's how you railroad the country to hell.
[00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:28.379]  So I'm very honored to have the worst snakes in this country coming after me and then wrapping themselves, you know, in the identity of dead children, trying to then silence the First Amendment in that process.
[00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:35.003]  And of course, they couldn't have a jury trial because we'd actually show what really went on and what we really said.
[00:59:35.344 --> 00:59:36.785]  And they know we convinced the jury.
[00:59:38.706 --> 00:59:50.154]   They know that a jury Guaranteed, at least a minority of them would think it was the First Amendment right to ask questions, and that what they'd said I'd done, I didn't do.
[00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:56.580]  And so, in the depositions and all the rest of it, we never got to depose anybody in Texas.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.106]  They just got to depose us for years and get all our documents and everything, and then say, you know, we gave them nothing, we got nothing from them.
[01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:06.970]  We were starting to get around to that, though, and they couldn't have that.
[01:00:08.925 --> 01:00:17.108]  And so now the judge is saying, no, you don't get to depose anybody, but we're going to keep deposing you because you're defaulted.
[01:00:17.168 --> 01:00:17.448]  Oh, really?
[01:00:17.508 --> 01:00:18.068]  I'm defaulted.
[01:00:18.088 --> 01:00:20.629]  I don't have any rights, but you can keep harassing me.
[01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:23.110]  And then a jury will decide how guilty we are.
[01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:26.011]  And they hope to get a big enough judgment to try to shut InfoWars down.
[01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:27.752]  And that's their admitted goal.
[01:00:30.132 --> 01:00:32.273]  That's what these people have said to our faces.
[01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:40.824]   And so understand that I'm not a gun manufacturing company.
[01:00:42.345 --> 01:00:48.030]  You see, I've got a voice and I've got a right to speech even if people say I don't and they're not going to shut anything down.
[01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:56.237]  In fact, I pledge that I'm launching two new shows that I will do religiously.
[01:00:57.128 --> 01:01:01.151]  And I'm going to write books, and I'm making films, as you've already seen again, and launching a bunch of big projects.
[01:01:01.871 --> 01:01:14.520]  Not because these people are attacking me, but because it's what I'm supposed to do in this historic time, evidenced by the whole system pulling out the stops and erasing due process, and doing all this horrible stuff to try to put us under the jail.
[01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:24.447]  I mean, Owen Schroyer went with us to the Capitol, tried to stop what was happening, and they did federal filing saying he broke barricades and attacked people, even though we have all the video of the opposite.
[01:01:26.969 --> 01:01:28.651]  He needs your prayers more than I do.
[01:01:31.373 --> 01:01:33.835]  But they've been trying to indict us for January 6th and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:44.184]  They just think, well, we've got Jones trying to stop it and we've got, you know, we've got all his records and, you know, such and such and we've subpoenaed everything and Jones didn't do anything.
[01:01:44.224 --> 01:01:45.385]  Everything Jones says is true.
[01:01:46.526 --> 01:01:47.206]  So what do we do?
[01:01:47.226 --> 01:01:50.049]  Well, let's just indict his co-host.
[01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.973]  So this is just next level.
[01:01:56.553 --> 01:01:57.874]  And so, I want to explain something.
[01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.896]  We have six trials currently with all the different lawsuits.
[01:02:01.276 --> 01:02:03.277]  The Sandy Hook, the Virginia thing, all of that.
[01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:10.742]  That all starts in March of next year, in four months, and runs all the way into September in Connecticut.
[01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:16.156]  It'll be on TV, three ring circus, HBO, all of them, televised.
[01:02:16.977 --> 01:02:19.199]  And if I don't show up when subpoenaed, they'll put me in jail.
[01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:24.064]  So I've got to come in there and be pilloried and attacked and lied about and not be able to defend myself.
[01:02:24.584 --> 01:02:26.566]  And you know, I mean, the whole thing's rigged.
[01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:27.988]  That's okay.
[01:02:29.147 --> 01:02:37.977]  Because they expected us to either declare bankruptcy years ago, or just go away, or not show up to this thing.
[01:02:38.518 --> 01:02:42.403]  That's why they had to do the default, because they can't actually face us where we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:02:42.543 --> 01:02:43.264]  They'll lose for sure!
[01:02:44.604 --> 01:02:47.587]  By the way, they know we did focus groups in Texas and Connecticut.
[01:02:47.607 --> 01:02:58.477]  They know that the focus groups, when shown this, all multiple ones per state, found that I was absolutely within my rights and that they actually got mad at the lawyers and the families.
[01:02:58.697 --> 01:03:04.802]  The focus groups did when they learned that they'd already gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in Bloomberg and all this stuff and the types of charities.
[01:03:04.842 --> 01:03:05.863]  And so they can't do that.
[01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:08.025]  This is just the Democratic Party.
[01:03:09.033 --> 01:03:16.995]  Wrapping themselves in these sad little dead children, and then mad at me that I questioned a public event that had major anomalies.
[01:03:17.035 --> 01:03:19.116]  I mean, most of these big events turned out to be fake.
[01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:25.577]  Like Jesse Smollett, or the Roe v. Wade baby wasn't killed, or Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:03:25.637 --> 01:03:30.638]  So, it has cost us millions and millions of dollars to fight these.
[01:03:30.698 --> 01:03:34.519]  And going to trial is very, very, very expensive.
[01:03:34.919 --> 01:03:36.200]  I mean, just my custody battle.
[01:03:37.116 --> 01:03:43.854]  When my ex-wife, five years ago, that was all over the news, had over 100 reporters at any one time, that cost me $300,000.
[01:03:46.249 --> 01:03:48.569]  And I mean, I had basically no money in the bank after that.
[01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:49.310]  I'm not complaining.
[01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:50.890]  It's just that we need money to operate here.
[01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.591]  And so it's going to cost millions of dollars to fight six lawsuits.
[01:03:55.991 --> 01:03:59.392]  Oh, yeah, there's four Sandy Hook ones and then two others.
[01:04:00.192 --> 01:04:08.173]  And they're just going to have circus trial after circus trial after circus trial to just bring up dead kids by hijacking the narrative of Alex Jones.
[01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:15.775]  They attach to me, the gun control lobbies attach to us and then claim we're attached to them and that we're getting famous and getting money off them when it's the opposite.
[01:04:16.235 --> 01:04:18.376]  So it's an inversion of reality yet again.
[01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:23.700]  So, we raised one twentieth of the money I want to raise, and that's great.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:30.484]  I want to thank folks that gave $102,000 at GiveSendGo, who are patriots.
[01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:41.871]   And if you want to raise money for whatever it is you're doing, and you're a conservative or a Christian, and you've been discriminated against, And you've not been able to, you know, go out and raise money.
[01:04:41.951 --> 01:04:43.612]  Hey, GiveSendGo's got a great community.
[01:04:43.652 --> 01:04:44.433]  We should all go there.
[01:04:44.773 --> 01:04:46.074]  We should all support each other there.
[01:04:46.334 --> 01:04:47.415]  There's real power in that.
[01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:49.697]  So GiveSendGo is there.
[01:04:49.717 --> 01:04:50.417]  We've raised $102,000.
[01:04:50.477 --> 01:04:53.379]  That's 5% of our goal.
[01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:54.400]  Sounds like a lot of money.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:14.368]   Except it's not when you actually have to put on a real defense and you have to go through all this stuff and you have to be there because they want to Scapegoat the American people and scapegoat gun owners for what happened to those children, and then use that against our Second Amendment and our First Amendment, they admit to get rid of free speech.
[01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:25.174]  They're on MSNBC saying, once we've gotten Alex Jones, we're going to get Tucker Carlson and everybody else with this model of defaults, where they have a judge that works for them, they go in, and then they just stage a fake trial and they get big judgments.
[01:05:26.104 --> 01:05:29.824]   uh... and so it's very very dangerous so please go to save him for wars dot com
[01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:33.104]   just one word saving for wars dot com and help us get
[01:05:33.104 --> 01:05:36.703]   soon to our goal of two million dollars because that's what we
[01:05:36.703 --> 01:05:38.824]   need to be able to fight this and go through this and you want
[01:05:38.824 --> 01:05:41.384]   to keep us on air and i was just roll over these people
[01:05:41.384 --> 01:05:50.724]   we need your support and so this is very historic shaving info wars dot com i thank you all for your support
[01:05:51.224 --> 01:05:53.623]  those who do not want us to speak.
[01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.153]  Think, just let me think.
[01:05:54.193 --> 01:06:00.135]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[01:06:00.215 --> 01:06:01.695]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:06:01.715 --> 01:06:02.035]  Damn it!
[01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:02.455]  Why?
[01:06:03.136 --> 01:06:09.537]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:20.465]   Words offer the means to meaning and The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:06:20.505 --> 01:06:21.505]  You decided, sir.
[01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:22.465]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:23.986]  You taught me every television in London!
[01:06:24.126 --> 01:06:26.347]  Cruelty and injustice.
[01:06:26.367 --> 01:06:27.627]  Intolerance and oppression.
[01:06:28.047 --> 01:06:38.171]  And where once you had the freedom to object, think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[01:06:38.891 --> 01:06:39.591]  How did this happen?
[01:06:40.332 --> 01:06:41.092]  Who's to blame?
[01:06:42.053 --> 01:06:44.777]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:06:45.118 --> 01:06:46.721]  They will be held accountable.
[01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:52.551]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:06:53.732 --> 01:06:55.533]  I know why you did it.
[01:06:55.733 --> 01:06:56.813]  I know you were afraid.
[01:06:57.233 --> 01:06:57.993]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:06:58.474 --> 01:06:59.094]  War?
[01:06:59.214 --> 01:06:59.614]  Terror?
[01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:00.554]  Disease?
[01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:07.497]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:07:07.577 --> 01:07:09.037]  Fear got the best of you.
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:13.919]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:15.039]  He promised you order.
[01:07:15.079 --> 01:07:16.080]  He promised you peace.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.400]   And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:28.400]  There is a war.
[01:07:28.547 --> 01:07:29.529]  It's happening now.
[01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:32.194]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:07:32.755 --> 01:07:34.578]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:07:35.399 --> 01:07:36.882]  We are the Resistance.
[01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:39.103]  We are the InfoWar.
[01:07:39.103 --> 01:07:41.103]  [Explosion]
[01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:43.103]  [Music]
[01:07:43.103 --> 01:07:45.103]  [Music]
[01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.103]  You know what Mark Zuckerberg's doing?
[01:07:47.942 --> 01:08:03.156]  It came out more than five years ago in his own company documents when whistleblowers warned the world that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook and to be depressed and alone so that avatars or fake computer identities would be their only friends.
[01:08:03.596 --> 01:08:06.619]  Thus taking full control of the user's mind.
[01:08:06.859 --> 01:08:24.534]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out with Facebook claiming ownership of the metaverse and buying up hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force its users and employees to solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg.
[01:08:25.094 --> 01:08:26.775]  And the organizations that he works with.
[01:08:27.356 --> 01:08:32.379]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses here in the third dimension.
[01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:43.386]  And to do that, they're creating an artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control of our bodies and our minds.
[01:08:43.826 --> 01:08:45.968]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[01:08:46.768 --> 01:08:55.853]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness is forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[01:08:56.593 --> 01:09:08.880]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension and not just enslave us, but finally completely destroy us and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.762]  This is beyond a satanic ritual.
[01:09:12.002 --> 01:09:14.445]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction.
[01:09:14.805 --> 01:09:18.128]  Because this is actually happening in the real world today.
[01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:20.631]  And we have discovered their secrets.
[01:09:20.671 --> 01:09:22.192]  We've discovered how to stop them.
[01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:31.461]  And we have put it all together in an easy to understand system that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists, but to transcend to the next level.
[01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:37.803]  It's so important for all of you that already know this innately and have already witnessed this for yourselves to understand.
[01:09:38.224 --> 01:09:50.888]  You are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity before they get trapped in this artificial matrix system the Globalists are building.
[01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.269]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:55.031]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[01:09:55.051 --> 01:10:03.739]  Documents came out in 1990, from the late 1970s, where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar to The Matrix.
[01:10:04.219 --> 01:10:06.161]  And all that information is now public.
[01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:18.712]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses, not just holding us in the third dimension, but actually creating an artificial slave system so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[01:10:19.312 --> 01:10:27.295]  Humanity are not robots, no matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this, but they are trying to turn us into robots.
[01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:31.817]  That's why in December of 2021 we are launching Reset Wars.
[01:10:32.037 --> 01:10:45.556]   Find out more information at ResetWars.com [Music]
[01:10:45.556 --> 01:10:49.876]   Well, I've been trying to get him in studio with us for a while and he's done it.
[01:10:49.934 --> 01:10:53.974]  Mike Cernovich, an old friend of mine, Cernovich.com, author, researcher.
[01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:57.995]  He had a number one film as well.
[01:10:58.095 --> 01:11:00.356]  Hoax went to the top of Amazon.
[01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:08.917]  Again, Mike Cernovich is a lawyer, author, free speech activist, a documentary filmmaker, featured film, free speech, silenced, a producer, unconvention.
[01:11:08.937 --> 01:11:10.497]  Hoax is a good one.
[01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.078]  Yeah, Hoax is excellent.
[01:11:11.098 --> 01:11:11.978]  Last one yet.
[01:11:12.818 --> 01:11:13.258]  Absolutely.
[01:11:14.382 --> 01:11:19.582]   iTunes for the year and it was two weeks in a row top-selling independent film
[01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:27.901]   right there with uncut gems 29 million dollar budget uncut gems and then hoaxed
[01:11:26.444 --> 01:11:27.724]  That's how, that's how good it did.
[01:11:28.085 --> 01:11:30.947]  With no, with no real, you know, traditional promotion.
[01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:33.168]  That's how many people are out there really.
[01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:35.650]  And I saw, I saw a rough cut of Alex's War.
[01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:36.971]  Amazing.
[01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:39.192]  The one, the new film coming out about you.
[01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.633]  I don't know if you've watched that.
[01:11:40.653 --> 01:11:41.353]  I have a rule.
[01:11:41.374 --> 01:11:41.914]  I don't watch things.
[01:11:41.974 --> 01:11:42.494]  Oh my God.
[01:11:42.554 --> 01:11:43.035]  It's so good.
[01:11:43.055 --> 01:11:44.716]  I've not seen Hoaxed even though I hit number one.
[01:11:45.056 --> 01:11:45.376]  Yeah.
[01:11:45.476 --> 01:11:50.780]  Even Shauna, um, who's not very political, my wife was like, this is really good filmmaking.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.342]  So Alex's War, I'm really excited for whenever that comes out.
[01:11:54.362 --> 01:11:56.985]   It's a very, It's a biopsy.
[01:11:57.085 --> 01:12:07.818]  I noticed in why the left's films are terrible, and Norm Macdonald did a segment on why Alec Baldwin isn't funny when he talks about Trump, and that's when it registered in my mind.
[01:12:08.659 --> 01:12:14.245]  The only way to do a good film about a subject is to let the subject express who they are.
[01:12:15.186 --> 01:12:19.468]  And the left doesn't want to let us do that about ourselves, so they try to caricature us.
[01:12:19.888 --> 01:12:23.950]  And then even the left doesn't want to watch it because they go, this is just a dumb film.
[01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:25.171]  This is just stupid.
[01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:27.552]  It's not reality, so it's not entertaining.
[01:12:27.712 --> 01:12:28.812]  Yeah, it's just stupid.
[01:12:29.132 --> 01:12:32.814]  So the only way to make a real film about us is to show who we really are.
[01:12:33.274 --> 01:12:35.795]  But if you show who you really are, then more and more people like us.
[01:12:35.815 --> 01:12:47.719]   So they're caught in this Terrible catch-22 of filmmaking where so I can't even read the articles about myself not because oh, I'm so sad They're they're being mean to me, but because it's dumb.
[01:12:48.079 --> 01:12:58.403]   It's stupid the same thing that when I try to read stuff about you so what I like about Alex's war the the film about you coming out is it isn't Alex Jones propaganda.
[01:12:58.723 --> 01:13:01.084]  It isn't Alex Jones is the greatest man who ever walks earth.
[01:13:01.164 --> 01:13:02.744]  It is this who is who he is.
[01:13:03.224 --> 01:13:04.645]  This is the character arc.
[01:13:04.705 --> 01:13:05.645]  This is the story arc.
[01:13:05.685 --> 01:13:07.066]  This is where he began.
[01:13:07.506 --> 01:13:08.467]  This is where he is now.
[01:13:08.527 --> 01:13:12.588]  This is the part that he's at the hero's journey and where you know, where is it going to end?
[01:13:13.068 --> 01:13:18.791]  We don't know because of course you're in a different character arc in your own life because even though you've done so much.
[01:13:19.871 --> 01:13:26.153]  There's now a seminal point in your life, a seminal conflict in your life, where Act 3 is actually beginning in your film.
[01:13:26.173 --> 01:13:39.717]  So as much as you've done, you're now moving into Act 3, which for me as a storyteller, filmmaker, and fan of the arts, I enjoy, even though personally I feel that you've been horribly mistreated.
[01:13:39.737 --> 01:13:50.403]   So I'm in this contradictory position in my life where Personally, I don't like what's happened to you or Bannon, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, me.
[01:13:51.004 --> 01:13:56.508]  But then I think artistically, it's the greatest art that we've ever witnessed in our life.
[01:13:56.568 --> 01:13:57.228]  It's real life.
[01:13:57.248 --> 01:13:59.089]  This is like Greek tragedy stuff.
[01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:00.911]  This is real good guys, bad guys.
[01:14:02.246 --> 01:14:08.570]  Good versus evil, the character arcs of people, the evil forces are marshalling against the forces of good.
[01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:13.153]  They're trying to attack anyone who speaks out in favor of God.
[01:14:13.193 --> 01:14:17.055]  It's anti-christian now, full-on anti-christian that can't really be denied.
[01:14:17.956 --> 01:14:20.717]  And I'm enthralled by the stories of the people.
[01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:21.698]  It's interesting.
[01:14:21.938 --> 01:14:24.260]  So I try to take a step back even for my own self.
[01:14:25.325 --> 01:14:44.096]  And not even look at my emotions or how I feel about a given situation, and I zoom out and think, what an incredible, and I've got to be careful because I don't want to maybe summon more tragedy on us, but I'll just say, what an incredible life God has led us to lead, if you view it that way.
[01:14:44.116 --> 01:14:45.978]  This is definitely a grand adventure.
[01:14:46.138 --> 01:14:58.144]   Yeah, God has said, I was praying one time about something, and God said to me, you said you didn't want a boring life, and now you're upset because your life isn't boring.
[01:14:58.444 --> 01:14:59.104]  Which is it, right?
[01:14:59.144 --> 01:15:05.948]  He was telling me, in your own mind, we pray to God, we want adventure, we want challenge, what are we really made of?
[01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:08.809]  We want this, and God says, okay, I'm gonna give this to you.
[01:15:08.829 --> 01:15:10.750]  Whoa, how dare you, God?
[01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:13.631]  I thought you loved your creations, your children.
[01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:15.192]  Why do you let them persecute me?
[01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:16.512]  And he really shook me up.
[01:15:16.532 --> 01:15:19.734]  Mike, what you're saying is absolutely true, and you sum it up better than I can.
[01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:27.357]  I don't like being persecuted a lot about, but we're forcing evil out in the open and it's making me better and stronger and making me a better person fighting this evil.
[01:15:27.577 --> 01:15:29.737]  We'll be right back with Mike Cernovich in studio.
[01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.678]  Tim Pool's coming up later as well.
[01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:32.498]  Stay with us.
[01:15:32.538 --> 01:15:33.039]  Cernovich.com.
[01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:36.216]  Wow.
[01:15:36.637 --> 01:15:38.138]  I mean, I always liked Mike Cernovich.
[01:15:38.178 --> 01:15:39.319]  I thought he was a really smart guy.
[01:15:39.359 --> 01:15:43.183]  But since he got married and had children years ago, it just took him to a whole other level.
[01:15:43.223 --> 01:15:44.304]  And I think that's the process.
[01:15:45.325 --> 01:15:46.406]  We can also talk about that.
[01:15:46.426 --> 01:15:48.427]  None of the top EU leaders have children.
[01:15:48.487 --> 01:15:48.908]  None of them do.
[01:15:49.308 --> 01:15:50.489]  That's a globalist thing.
[01:15:50.509 --> 01:15:51.590]  This is a post-human world.
[01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:56.074]  They're giving up their humanity to be God, they believe, but they need to lock us in our five senses.
[01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.977]  So you were talking about the infinity timeline during the break.
[01:15:59.477 --> 01:16:00.458]  That's a great term.
[01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:02.140]  Expand on that, Mike Cernovich.
[01:16:02.737 --> 01:16:08.883]  Yeah, it was occurring to me how, and you were mentioning some of the dreams you had that I definitely want to talk more about on this segment.
[01:16:09.543 --> 01:16:17.651]  You have the timeline of the animal or the timeline of carnal pleasure, the timeline of they want you to eat your bugs.
[01:16:18.251 --> 01:16:24.397]  Put on your VR goggles, masturbate to internet pornography, and then chase your next hunger pain.
[01:16:24.858 --> 01:16:33.347]  And that's the timeline of the devil, the timeline of hedonic pleasure, chasing that next hit of dopamine, that next hit of carnal pleasure, right?
[01:16:33.767 --> 01:16:34.448]  Animal pleasure.
[01:16:34.768 --> 01:16:35.889]  The timeline of God.
[01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.952]  Is connection and universal love and connection to infinity.
[01:16:40.733 --> 01:16:43.935]  We can't obviously be in that state because we have to live in this world.
[01:16:44.295 --> 01:16:58.845]  So there's a sense that we're walking or if we try we walk between two worlds the world of God the world of love the world of not everything goes your way, but pushing through that versus the world of man, which is oh, I'm hungry.
[01:16:58.865 --> 01:16:59.786]  I need to eat now.
[01:16:59.806 --> 01:17:00.866]  I'm going to eat a lot now.
[01:17:00.927 --> 01:17:01.307]  I'm bored.
[01:17:01.907 --> 01:17:14.194]  Somebody entertained me now I'm gonna go cause problems for other people the left wants people on the timeline of the animal and Then the right the real right not these fake conservatives these fake Christians like David French who?
[01:17:14.574 --> 01:17:40.816]   Come in God's name and then deceive people those people are in a really gonna have a real hard problem on Judgment Day, but the real right wants people in the timeline of God which is that I would not say, as Jesus said, bless your persecutors, but the more that I thought about it, and a lot of things have been revealed to me in visions, the more that I have developed a love for those who persecute me, because I realize that they were traumatized as kids.
[01:17:41.317 --> 01:17:42.337]  They're in denial of that.
[01:17:42.377 --> 01:17:48.722]  That's why they come out in defense of pedophilia so much, is because I realized they've all been molested as kids.
[01:17:48.762 --> 01:17:49.903]  That's how they think they get love.
[01:17:50.183 --> 01:18:07.510]  Yeah, so they got molested as kids, and that's why they attack me, because rather than deal with that internal trauma of what they experienced, and reaching inward and ripping your heart open, and letting that pain and that weepingness come out, and then healing yourself through trauma, they're lashing out.
[01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:11.452]  So in my own mind, this is what God's been telling me is, hey, you don't have to be their friends.
[01:18:11.672 --> 01:18:32.241]   Nobody's saying be their friends, nobody's saying let somebody kill you or your family, but you have to love your persecutors, Because they have unresolved deep psychological trauma from child abuse they suffered as kids, and rather than, again, rip their heart open and feel the healing of the Lord and the healing of God, they're going to attack you to live in denial of that.
[01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:33.122]  Exactly.
[01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:41.728]   And what I experienced with the first stalkers I had 25 years ago was, As soon as I forgave them and didn't care anymore, they would instantly go away.
[01:18:41.748 --> 01:18:44.290]  There was a sixth sense.
[01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:47.593]  There was a connection by the stalker against the person being stalked.
[01:18:48.054 --> 01:19:03.027]   And I've just learned with these dirty lawyers and corrupt groups and others that really hate me and just rise when they see me, that that's because they're in spiritual bondage and they can see that I'm free and what's taken them over Hates them just as much as it hates me.
[01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:05.108]  And they're like a drowning person.
[01:19:05.148 --> 01:19:08.109]  You try to save them, they try to push you under and climb up on top of you.
[01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:10.209]  And so you realize that they're a danger.
[01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:11.150]  They're like a zombie.
[01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:12.770]  You don't want to let them walk up and bite you.
[01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:14.111]  You've got to keep them at arm's length.
[01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:17.192]  But they really are a failed, fallen person.
[01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:20.973]  And so you shouldn't rejoice in how stunted and twisted they are.
[01:19:21.353 --> 01:19:25.235]  You should know that that's a failure and that we should have saved them.
[01:19:25.755 --> 01:19:27.837]  Yeah, they're running in denial of themselves.
[01:19:27.957 --> 01:19:37.445]  And I learned just through a lot of experiences I've had, turning more introspective, is I've uncovered in my own self trauma that I didn't even know that I had.
[01:19:37.765 --> 01:19:41.569]  And then I realized that a lot of what we do is we're running from ourselves.
[01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:44.131]  We become strong because we're afraid to be weak.
[01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.792]  Well, why are we afraid to be weak?
[01:19:46.233 --> 01:19:48.695]  Well, we're afraid to be weak because something bad happened to us.
[01:19:49.015 --> 01:19:53.015]   when we were younger and then we become strong so that no one can hurt us
[01:19:53.015 --> 01:19:58.294]   and then we use that strength to turn outward and we end up in this endless conflict with people
[01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:03.815]   often people who are hurt also and instead the past you know several years especially
[01:20:03.815 --> 01:20:07.734]   the past two or three I just keep looking inward at my own trauma now.
[01:20:07.884 --> 01:20:11.448]  So I like to listen to binaural beats or spiritual music.
[01:20:12.289 --> 01:20:13.931]  And I cry a lot now.
[01:20:14.251 --> 01:20:19.798]  I just let things out now because I used to think that, you know, real men don't cry, real men fight back.
[01:20:19.838 --> 01:20:22.881]  And then I realized, why would I run for myself though?
[01:20:22.961 --> 01:20:27.667]  How is it to be a real man to run from the trauma within yourself?
[01:20:27.987 --> 01:20:29.248]  Well, and I also think it's a balance.
[01:20:29.269 --> 01:20:34.454]  I mean, we're designed, like a plant in zero gravity doesn't grow as well as a plant that's out in the sun and the wind and the rain.
[01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:43.364]  Part of that's what makes us stronger, but we don't want to then have that take us over and dominate us, that aspect, and then, exactly, then do it to other people back.
[01:20:43.384 --> 01:20:47.327]   Because that's what happened to me is, I got in a lot of just vicious fights.
[01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:48.608]  I got beat up by bullies a lot.
[01:20:48.648 --> 01:20:51.170]  That's just the way, you know, East Texas was growing up.
[01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:53.931]  And it was extremely violent, like worse than you see in movies.
[01:20:54.472 --> 01:20:59.895]  And then I got very tough and got into that identity of just being an absolute, like, you know, psycho in a fight.
[01:21:00.235 --> 01:21:02.877]  And then that became kind of like almost a satanic aspect of me.
[01:21:03.177 --> 01:21:05.679]  And then I've learned how to just get rid of that and turn loose of it.
[01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:09.761]  I still can fight if I need to, but I'm not the raging animal anymore.
[01:21:10.101 --> 01:21:13.463]  That's just one small aspect of me that I've got that I can break the glass if I need it.
[01:21:13.643 --> 01:21:14.444]  But now it's under control.
[01:21:14.804 --> 01:21:25.834]  Well, I'm glad that you said that you can still fight if you need to, because it sounds like God's talking to a lot of people, because that was told to me during a vision where I said, well, I don't want to be this way.
[01:21:26.795 --> 01:21:32.341]  You know, I don't want to be kind and loving, right, towards the world, because in my mind, if you attack me, that's a speed.
[01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.824]  And the message was, you can always be that way.
[01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:36.764]  Just try love.
[01:21:36.964 --> 01:21:38.145]  Try to be more loving to people.
[01:21:38.425 --> 01:21:40.106]  Try to be a little bit more decent to people.
[01:21:40.426 --> 01:21:45.108]  Try to understand that, hey man, they have unresolved trauma, and they were abused as children.
[01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:48.670]  That's what they're running from, and that's why they're attacking you, because they see you as a father figure.
[01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:50.511]  They see you as the people who hurt them.
[01:21:50.831 --> 01:22:05.037]   And then you realize that our burden, or our cross to bear, metaphorically speaking, is that They're hurting, they don't want to admit that they're hurting, so then they want to hurt other people, and then what we do is we think, well, now you hurt me, and I'm going to continue this cycle of trauma.
[01:22:05.457 --> 01:22:22.662]  Which is, you have trauma, you attack me, and then I attack you, and now we're engaged in a never-ending conflict of trauma, instead of going within and realizing, I want to attack the wicked ones, I want to attack the entities that try to embody people and often do become embodied in people.
[01:22:23.022 --> 01:22:25.183]  You're feeding into demonic energy when you do that.
[01:22:25.683 --> 01:22:30.485]  But then the flip side is we do live in a world where you can't just let people destroy you or run over you.
[01:22:30.505 --> 01:22:33.566]  So you've got to do it from a controlled position where you don't get roped into their level.
[01:22:33.826 --> 01:22:43.570]  You still stand up for yourself, you fight the evil, but you realize that jumping right in to people trying to punch your buttons is literally letting them control you.
[01:22:43.851 --> 01:22:44.711]  Yeah, then they win.
[01:22:45.111 --> 01:22:52.200]  Because they're able now to, it's almost like a bullfight, they're able to get you to play by their rules and play by your game.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:58.868]  So more and more when people try to initiate conflict with me, I say I'm praying for you, I love you, often they get more angry.
[01:22:59.329 --> 01:23:08.874]   And then I realize that This is sad, the sad realization that I had was, if you attack me and I attack you back, you feel validated and good.
[01:23:09.214 --> 01:23:13.016]  If you attack me and I say, man, I love you, I'm going to pray for you, you actually get angrier.
[01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:25.541]  Because that demon within you, the entities, the demons, whatever people want to call them, the dark energy then becomes enraged because they're working through you and now they're being received love and of course they exist in the world of hate.
[01:23:26.161 --> 01:23:26.882]  They get angrier.
[01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.903]  So more and more and more, I just think, I love you.
[01:23:28.923 --> 01:23:30.084]  It doesn't mean you're gonna steamroll me.
[01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:33.927]  It doesn't mean that you're gonna... You transcend that negative energy level.
[01:23:34.148 --> 01:23:34.308]  Right.
[01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:37.590]  At least until we can get to a higher level.
[01:23:37.611 --> 01:23:39.352]  I don't want to be Job, obviously.
[01:23:39.712 --> 01:23:43.835]  So when I pray, I'm careful because I'm grateful for the suffering God has given me.
[01:23:43.855 --> 01:23:45.356]  Oh yeah, I don't want to be given a Jobian quest.
[01:23:45.376 --> 01:23:46.277]  Yeah, I don't want to be Job.
[01:23:46.297 --> 01:23:47.778]  We're kind of getting on one now.
[01:23:48.018 --> 01:23:55.944]  And that's where I struggle in my own prayer practice, is I thank God for the struggles, but I say, whoa, but I'm not trying to be Job here, God.
[01:23:56.004 --> 01:24:00.528]  I still want to have a nice life and enjoy some of this earthly experience.
[01:24:00.988 --> 01:24:04.531]  But Jobian, of course, would be the ultimate transcendence of the human condition.
[01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:07.832]  And becoming completely connected to the divine.
[01:24:08.353 --> 01:24:09.553]  And I'm not there yet.
[01:24:09.914 --> 01:24:11.895]  It's up to God whether that's going to happen to us.
[01:24:11.955 --> 01:24:12.995]  Hopefully, hopefully not.
[01:24:13.015 --> 01:24:18.978]  It might happen to everybody around now because of what the new guard, the new Red Guard is trying to do here in this country.
[01:24:19.519 --> 01:24:20.799]  We'll talk about that next hour.
[01:24:20.859 --> 01:24:27.423]  But definitely, they even talk about it, the magicians, the wizards that run the dark side.
[01:24:27.983 --> 01:24:29.744]  They know their time's coming to an end.
[01:24:29.804 --> 01:24:33.526]  And that's what all this oppression is about, to keep us in a lower state they can control.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.602]  That's why they're going harder and harder on anything Christian.
[01:24:38.342 --> 01:24:41.824]  That's why they're going harder and harder on anyone who has traditional values.
[01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:45.986]  That's why they're making a saint of a literal convicted pedophile.
[01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:57.692]  It used to be, it was a conspiracy theory to say that most of these Antifa people were pedophiles, and then there's an actual convicted pedophile who gets shot trying to harm a minor, and now he's their new saint.
[01:24:57.932 --> 01:24:59.273]  So the left is propped up!
[01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:03.234]  From the Kenosha event, they're trying to prop up a pedophile as a saint.
[01:25:03.734 --> 01:25:08.476]  That's something that five years ago, they would have said, well, you're a conspiracy theorist for saying that.
[01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:11.356]  And now I think, well, they're holding signs out there with this picture.
[01:25:11.376 --> 01:25:14.797]  They're calling him a superhero, convicted pedophile, hurt children 9 to 11.
[01:25:15.238 --> 01:25:16.038]  And it wasn't just.
[01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:17.839]  That was horrific.
[01:25:18.019 --> 01:25:18.820]  We'll just leave it there.
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.201]  We don't need to go into details.
[01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.003]  That's what they're doing to prop up.
[01:25:22.604 --> 01:25:25.086]  But that shows their desperation.
[01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.009]  Because they have to go to that level now.
[01:25:28.309 --> 01:25:30.031]  They have to sink to that level of evil.
[01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:31.652]  Because so much good is arising.
[01:25:31.672 --> 01:25:33.855]  And our biggest problem, honestly, are the false prophets.
[01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.757]  The people who claim to come in God's name and clearly aren't.
[01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:37.718]  They're misleading people.
[01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:39.839]  They're connected with the father of lies.
[01:25:39.879 --> 01:25:42.041]  The, you know, conservative media people.
[01:25:42.481 --> 01:25:46.845]  That is a bigger problem even than the left because they're misleading and deceiving Christians.
[01:25:47.846 --> 01:25:48.586]  Well, I know this.
[01:25:48.606 --> 01:25:49.267]  The U.S.
[01:25:49.307 --> 01:25:54.371]  Senators know that Pfizer did a world contract and that we signed on to a world government contract.
[01:25:54.391 --> 01:25:55.191]  They're not talking about it.
[01:25:55.912 --> 01:26:00.015]  And that's the big... So I want to bring some of that up with you as well because that's happening.
[01:26:00.215 --> 01:26:01.937]  The Archbishop, though, he is talking about it all.
[01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.898]  Well, they definitely want us to be blind spiritually.
[01:26:04.918 --> 01:26:08.999]  Mike Starnes is with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:10.339]  Hell, and Tim Pool gets in here.
[01:26:10.359 --> 01:26:12.480]  I mean, he says he's coming on, but he's always busy.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.240]  That guy works hard.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:14.721]  We'll have a roundtable discussion.
[01:26:15.261 --> 01:26:20.502]  And you guys had a great roundtable discussion, I guess it was last night, out in his travel trailer.
[01:26:20.602 --> 01:26:22.203]  I really like how he set that RV up.
[01:26:22.383 --> 01:26:22.583]  Yeah.
[01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:24.724]  Tim's the hardest working man in media.
[01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:28.247]  I used to be the hardest man, and then I saw how hard Tim Pool worked.
[01:26:28.568 --> 01:26:45.543]  And the media thing, there's levels to this where some people, I was actually making a chart that I was thinking about where you have raw charisma, and you would be at the very absolute top of the raw charisma, to the degree that a lot of people think, oh, I could have been an actor.
[01:26:45.563 --> 01:26:46.363]  You could have done anything.
[01:26:46.444 --> 01:26:49.987]  So you're the highest level of charisma, and then you're in the grid of hard working.
[01:26:50.467 --> 01:26:54.870]  And then you have people who work really hard and maybe have lower charisma, and it's always finding a balance.
[01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:58.113]  Well, I think you're super smart, and I think Tim's super smart.
[01:26:58.393 --> 01:27:04.418]  I mean, getting to know Tim, the stuff he says behind the scenes, it's like, wow, he really says things that are true that I've never thought before.
[01:27:04.438 --> 01:27:04.878]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:04.938 --> 01:27:05.739]  Like, he's insightful.
[01:27:05.919 --> 01:27:07.841]  Yeah, he's very analytical and he works very hard.
[01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:10.383]  Whereas I don't work nearly as hard as either of you.
[01:27:10.763 --> 01:27:12.685]  So there's definitely levels.
[01:27:13.065 --> 01:27:15.087]  And that was something to talk about.
[01:27:15.467 --> 01:27:17.949]  The strange thing is I quit working so hard.
[01:27:18.029 --> 01:27:18.610]  I was grinding.
[01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:21.132]  You remember those days where I was on all the time.
[01:27:21.312 --> 01:27:22.013]  You were 20 hours a day.
[01:27:22.273 --> 01:27:31.335]  Yeah and then I was with you and we were in a diner in Austin and when we walked in, this is 2017 maybe, you're more famous now, the whole restaurant like stopped.
[01:27:31.495 --> 01:27:35.896]  It was a buzzing where people were, I could feel the energy and then I started, oh is that him?
[01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:36.676]  Is that him?
[01:27:38.077 --> 01:27:41.777]  And then the waitress said, oh my husband's a cook, he wants to come meet you.
[01:27:42.258 --> 01:27:43.838]  Everybody knew who you were and I thought, you know what?
[01:27:45.043 --> 01:27:46.384]  I don't want that level of fame.
[01:27:46.404 --> 01:27:47.926]  I remember you said that pretty much that day.
[01:27:48.006 --> 01:27:50.107]  Yeah, and I never did your show after that.
[01:27:50.468 --> 01:27:55.071]  And then it created all this drama on the internet where people say, oh, you betrayed Alex, you backstabbed Alex.
[01:27:56.613 --> 01:27:59.135]  I told you people a hundred times I don't want to be famous.
[01:27:59.355 --> 01:28:00.496]  It's like they don't believe me.
[01:28:01.096 --> 01:28:01.917]  But I told you that.
[01:28:02.157 --> 01:28:03.839]  I remember you were frustrated by Trump.
[01:28:03.899 --> 01:28:06.961]  You didn't want to attack him, but he was, I mean, I'll just say it.
[01:28:07.562 --> 01:28:08.443]  I would get more supportive.
[01:28:08.463 --> 01:28:11.045]  I just blindly supported Trump, but I'm getting really sick of him.
[01:28:11.545 --> 01:28:12.265]  Yeah, I mean, I can't.
[01:28:12.325 --> 01:28:13.726]  I want to go bullhorn his house.
[01:28:13.786 --> 01:28:16.166]  I don't want to go under the tunnel and meet with him and eat dinner with him.
[01:28:16.206 --> 01:28:16.806]  I could have done that.
[01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.627]  I want him to stop it and be who he can really be.
[01:28:19.907 --> 01:28:22.708]  That's why I got mad at Joe Rogan a few years ago, because he could really change the world.
[01:28:22.928 --> 01:28:23.908]  And he's starting to go in that direction.
[01:28:23.948 --> 01:28:26.149]  It's not my job to make people be good guys.
[01:28:26.489 --> 01:28:30.190]  It's just that Trump really screwed the pooch with some of the things he's done.
[01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:31.850]  We'll talk about it next segment, but keep going, sorry.
[01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:36.692]  Yeah, the notoriety and the fame that you had, I just cut.
[01:28:36.832 --> 01:28:37.672]  I pretty much went dark.
[01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:47.961]  And I'm not dark as in evil, dark as in I quit doing a lot of streamings, I cut back a lot, and then people had all these conspiracy theories, ironically enough, about you and me, and we had some huge falling out.
[01:28:48.481 --> 01:28:52.665]  Where really, I just remember that moment at the Austin Diner, I said, Alex, I don't ever want to be like this.
[01:28:53.145 --> 01:29:00.672]  And you said, oh, you got to accept it, it's the burden, it's the price of being a truth teller and a storyteller and sharing true information with people.
[01:29:01.661 --> 01:29:02.322]  I didn't want it.
[01:29:02.522 --> 01:29:07.605]  So I went to a much lower profile to the degree that I don't even know if I'm relevant.
[01:29:07.625 --> 01:29:08.466]  Apparently, I still am.
[01:29:08.506 --> 01:29:19.914]  People recognize me in public all the time, but I tried to go way down to a much lower level of notoriety because that's where I do better creativity-wise.
[01:29:19.934 --> 01:29:21.635]  It's where I do better spirituality-wise.
[01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:23.777]  But it was something to just see.
[01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:25.998]  And again, you're way bigger now than you were then.
[01:29:26.499 --> 01:29:27.439]  To be in that moment.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.003]  And I felt like that was even a message from God to say, do you want this?
[01:29:33.283 --> 01:29:35.504]  And I said, no, I definitely don't want this.
[01:29:35.524 --> 01:29:37.025]  But then you went on to make a bunch of number one films.
[01:29:37.065 --> 01:29:38.106]  So it's not like you've been hiding under a rock.
[01:29:38.126 --> 01:29:39.427]  Well, because I had an obligation.
[01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.328]  I had an obligation to the people.
[01:29:41.348 --> 01:29:43.149]  Because you were starting Hoax then, right?
[01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:43.269]  Yes.
[01:29:43.749 --> 01:29:44.649]  Yeah, I was starting Hoax.
[01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:46.771]  I had an obligation to the people who crowdfunded it.
[01:29:46.791 --> 01:29:50.833]  I had an obligation to the directors who have all moved on to bigger and better things now.
[01:29:51.473 --> 01:29:53.914]  I had an obligation morally to get it out there.
[01:29:53.934 --> 01:29:58.457]  And then once that was done, I haven't done anything big since Hoax, right?
[01:29:58.957 --> 01:29:59.837]  I'm still around.
[01:29:59.898 --> 01:30:00.518]  I still show up.
[01:30:00.558 --> 01:30:01.879]  Well, I'm glad I finally got you to come to town.
[01:30:01.899 --> 01:30:03.219]  I've only asked you about 400 times.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.742]  Yeah, and I kept saying I was going to, and then I had to retreat a little bit.
[01:30:08.522 --> 01:30:10.708]  It's complicated for people.
[01:30:10.728 --> 01:30:11.631]  We're going to go to it for 60 seconds.
[01:30:11.651 --> 01:30:13.636]  When we come back, though, why are you re-emerging?
[01:30:14.218 --> 01:30:14.398]  Okay.
[01:30:15.498 --> 01:30:17.800]  And people can find what you're doing at Cernovich.com.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.340]  Where else?
[01:30:18.841 --> 01:30:20.102]  Um, hoax movie.
[01:30:20.122 --> 01:30:21.543]  Just watch hoax movie and tell people.
[01:30:21.943 --> 01:30:24.786]  Yeah, you know, I mean, again, it's kind of rude to say I didn't watch it.
[01:30:24.826 --> 01:30:28.389]  It's just things I'm in, I look like such a fat Albert creature.
[01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.611]  I'm going to watch it, and I'm going to watch Alex's War.
[01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:34.814]  In fact, she just sent me the latest update on it the other day, and my friends have watched it.
[01:30:34.834 --> 01:30:36.656]  It's pretty powerful, and I appreciate the plug for that.
[01:30:36.676 --> 01:30:43.061]  Because, you know, they've got three different HBO and two other cable channels.
[01:30:44.426 --> 01:30:47.480]  One of them's Netflix are all doing big-budget anti-Alex Jones movies.
[01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:57.997]  Wow, Mike Cernovich is really on fire, and he's talking about the big galactic battle, good versus evil, and the Rubicon that we've crossed.
[01:30:58.057 --> 01:31:00.139]  So let's get into wherever you want to go next.
[01:31:00.199 --> 01:31:01.540]  I mean, I also want to talk about Trump.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:08.104]  I don't fetishize attacking Trump like some people do to, like, prove their avant-garde or they're the most conservative.
[01:31:08.144 --> 01:31:09.526]  Trump has incredible potential.
[01:31:09.826 --> 01:31:11.047]  I believe he really means well.
[01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:14.970]  But once he signs on to something like this vaccine, then he's pig-headed.
[01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:25.173]   But the last straw for me is January 6th, not defending the innocent people enough, and I know that's an issue for you, and also what happened with Julian Assange.
[01:31:25.193 --> 01:31:38.377]  I mean, I remember Trump three months before the election, they can pull the clip up, saying, hey, I don't care where Hillary's emails came from, I don't care if it's a fat guy, you know, in his mom's basement or who, Julian Assange or the Russians or whoever's got it, release it.
[01:31:38.397 --> 01:31:39.797]  And then saying, WikiLeaks, release it.
[01:31:40.097 --> 01:31:41.798]  And then they release it, he wins the election.
[01:31:42.438 --> 01:31:44.799]  And then he just lets him twist in the wind.
[01:31:45.179 --> 01:31:48.899]  That, to me, then proved a lot of the stuff I heard about Trump only caring about Trump.
[01:31:48.919 --> 01:31:51.540]  Because if I was the president, I don't give a damn what the deep state said.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.020]  Julian Assange is getting a pardon.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.121]  Yeah, there's a mantra that I live by, which goes like this, character is destiny.
[01:31:59.022 --> 01:32:04.003]  And that's why I tend to make the best predictions out of, you know, you make great ones too, obviously.
[01:32:04.403 --> 01:32:06.143]  That's why people say, how do you know what's happening?
[01:32:06.163 --> 01:32:07.664]  How do you know what this is going to happen?
[01:32:07.684 --> 01:32:08.624]  What character is destiny?
[01:32:09.804 --> 01:32:12.425]  Solve with Trump, when I solve with Trump, character is destiny.
[01:32:12.865 --> 01:32:18.847]  When he fired General Flynn, that was to me a seminal moment in your character.
[01:32:18.887 --> 01:32:23.269]  So there is in every man, woman's life, what you call a seminal moment.
[01:32:23.309 --> 01:32:26.710]  This is what defines who you are and how you handle it.
[01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:35.054]  Trump fired General Flynn because he was being bullied by the media, because he was being bullied by Mike Pence or whoever else, who Mike Pence in the end did what?
[01:32:35.294 --> 01:32:37.515]  Mike Pence sided with the establishment.
[01:32:37.555 --> 01:32:44.099]  So that was also a characteristic destiny moment for Mike Pence, because Mike Pence revealed who he was by demanding that General Flynn be fired.
[01:32:44.459 --> 01:32:55.811]   And right when I saw that, I said, I don't dislike Trump because I'm a true conservative who write these false prophets, as I call them, the false prophets at the National Review.
[01:32:56.431 --> 01:32:57.533]  That's not why I disliked him.
[01:32:58.193 --> 01:33:02.058]  I disliked him because that was a moment of grave moral weakness.
[01:33:02.558 --> 01:33:04.218]  It was a moment of low character.
[01:33:04.318 --> 01:33:06.739]  It was a moment of being pathetic.
[01:33:07.119 --> 01:33:09.620]  And that right there showed me, okay, Trump's weak.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:12.120]  And he's going to be weak throughout his presidency.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.681]  And then they brought in all the Soros people.
[01:33:13.941 --> 01:33:15.741]  And then they brought in the Never Trumpers.
[01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:18.322]  He didn't hire his own loyal people.
[01:33:18.362 --> 01:33:19.962]  He didn't defend his loyal people.
[01:33:20.482 --> 01:33:26.404]  He could have pardoned everybody who got indicted right away by this Mueller thing that we now know is a hoax.
[01:33:26.444 --> 01:33:27.464]  It's all been proven as a hoax.
[01:33:27.484 --> 01:33:28.844]  Yeah, I know I'm not with the Russians.
[01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.805]  And I watched congressional hearings where they said, I am a Russian.
[01:33:32.585 --> 01:33:34.245]  Yeah, they would say absurd things about me too.
[01:33:34.266 --> 01:33:38.186]  I've read articles where they claim that I would talk to people on burner phones and everything.
[01:33:38.206 --> 01:33:40.327]  I was like, who would I talk to on a burner phone?
[01:33:40.707 --> 01:33:40.927]  Right?
[01:33:41.047 --> 01:33:47.409]  But in their mind, there were all these machinations happening behind the scene when really I would just stream.
[01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:51.750]  I could talk to whoever wanted to and I would talk to them on the telephone, but I don't want to talk to anyone.
[01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.210]  Right?
[01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:58.572]   I've never talked to any of these people on the phone actually because in my own mind, I'm the culture.
[01:33:58.632 --> 01:34:00.274]  It would be them talking to me, right?
[01:34:00.675 --> 01:34:02.977]  In my mind, why do I want to talk to Trump?
[01:34:03.458 --> 01:34:06.241]  Trump should want, you know, Trump would want to talk to me, but why would I talk to him?
[01:34:06.562 --> 01:34:08.945]  What would be interesting about that?
[01:34:09.285 --> 01:34:10.947]  Well, you know, Tucker Carlson hates Trump.
[01:34:11.508 --> 01:34:14.492]  Well, anybody who has, anybody who respects moral character...
[01:34:15.052 --> 01:34:17.574]  Doesn't like Trump because he doesn't have moral character.
[01:34:17.854 --> 01:34:21.816]  He got, remember he shut down the government, got dog walked by Nancy Pelosi.
[01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.978]  He said, I'll never sign another one of these big spending bills.
[01:34:25.018 --> 01:34:26.339]  And then of course he signs another one.
[01:34:26.599 --> 01:34:30.682]  They dog walked him every time Mitch dog walked him every time he backed down.
[01:34:30.722 --> 01:34:34.224]  So in every group, let's just talk about Trump and Mike Tyson.
[01:34:34.244 --> 01:34:44.594]   For example, if you listen to, you know, custom model before he went, if you listen to Tyson's trainers, They would tell you that Tyson only had four real fights.
[01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:49.758]  The reason being is, everybody he beat was in a fight because he was so good.
[01:34:50.318 --> 01:34:52.320]  But then he fought Holyfield, that was a real fight.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:57.844]  What happened, and Mike Tyson admits this, so I'm not here to bash Mike Tyson, he failed.
[01:34:58.024 --> 01:35:00.546]  In every real fight Mike Tyson had, he failed.
[01:35:00.966 --> 01:35:04.589]   In every real fight that Trump had, He failed.
[01:35:05.069 --> 01:35:12.638]  He did not pardon Julian Assange, he did not pardon Snowden, he did not pardon Ross Ubrecht, he didn't pardon the non-violent January 6th protesters.
[01:35:12.938 --> 01:35:21.628]  He could have issued, a lot of people don't know this because you're not allowed to talk about it, he could have said, I hereby pardon everybody who engaged in non-violence.
[01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:24.010]  And the Capitol, January 6th incident.
[01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:27.533]  So then the people who are violent and were hitting cops, yeah, sure, go to jail.
[01:35:27.974 --> 01:35:28.674]  They belong there.
[01:35:28.955 --> 01:35:37.983]  But the random boomers who came into town and didn't know anything and it was like a rock concert and everybody's walking one way and then you walk in the Capitol and you look around, oh, here's the Capitol.
[01:35:38.403 --> 01:35:39.084]  Take a selfie.
[01:35:39.424 --> 01:35:40.465]  Their lives have been destroyed.
[01:35:40.706 --> 01:35:41.987]  That was a moral failing on his part.
[01:35:42.127 --> 01:35:47.210]   I do not Ever excuse or defend moral character weakness.
[01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:48.410]  And that's what he is.
[01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:49.111]  Here's the thing.
[01:35:49.291 --> 01:35:51.312]  Trump could be salvaged, I think, partially.
[01:35:51.392 --> 01:35:55.353]  At least the people he endorses are getting elected.
[01:35:55.473 --> 01:35:56.594]  And so he has some value.
[01:35:56.614 --> 01:35:58.115]  I'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[01:35:58.515 --> 01:36:01.056]  It's just watching the Q thing and the delusions.
[01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.717]  And he's invincible.
[01:36:02.997 --> 01:36:06.198]  That kept people from really being awake and involved and let them steal the election.
[01:36:06.618 --> 01:36:10.940]  And so part of having Trump gone now really makes people realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:18.689]   Because, I mean, I got really I was never in the Trump cult, but I really wanted him to succeed.
[01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:21.653]  And now, what do you think happens with Trump?
[01:36:21.674 --> 01:36:26.032]   Because he told Roger Stone a few months ago, At dinner.
[01:36:26.052 --> 01:36:27.313]  I mean, he said, I'm running again.
[01:36:27.773 --> 01:36:28.913]  So he's running again, folks.
[01:36:29.294 --> 01:36:31.895]  And he's now exercising hours a day to lose weight.
[01:36:32.175 --> 01:36:33.115]  He's lost a ton of weight.
[01:36:34.076 --> 01:36:37.137]  And I mean, Trump is, if you thought Trump wanted to win before, look out.
[01:36:37.597 --> 01:36:39.998]  Well, it goes back to, I think, character is destiny.
[01:36:40.578 --> 01:36:42.639]  I don't see, his character's not going to change.
[01:36:42.719 --> 01:36:46.381]  The people he has around him are the same people who backstabbed him in the White House.
[01:36:46.881 --> 01:36:48.281]  I think he gets trounced.
[01:36:48.442 --> 01:36:49.842]  Unless they run Kamala Harris.
[01:36:50.242 --> 01:36:53.823]   If they run Kamala Harris, then Who is good?
[01:36:53.903 --> 01:36:56.344]  Or don't look to presidential leaders?
[01:36:57.784 --> 01:37:00.405]  What's your scoop on people like DeSantis?
[01:37:01.045 --> 01:37:12.828]  Well, the issue is complicated because Trump, despite my belief that he is a coward, truly a coward, and I mean that advisedly, a complete and total coward, the country was still better under him.
[01:37:13.268 --> 01:37:21.033]  So if he runs and it's Donald J. Trump or Kamala Harris, then clearly I'm not going to vote for her.
[01:37:21.313 --> 01:37:21.673]  Hitler.
[01:37:22.353 --> 01:37:22.634]  Evil.
[01:37:22.674 --> 01:37:24.074]  She kept innocent people in jail.
[01:37:24.114 --> 01:37:25.715]  This is the left talks about purpose.
[01:37:25.815 --> 01:37:26.036]  Yeah.
[01:37:26.076 --> 01:37:26.216]  Yeah.
[01:37:26.236 --> 01:37:27.056]  This has all been proven.
[01:37:27.076 --> 01:37:29.077]  There are petitions you can find that the media never wanted.
[01:37:29.237 --> 01:37:29.798]  She's black.
[01:37:29.818 --> 01:37:31.179]  She was in a one drop of African blood.
[01:37:31.239 --> 01:37:32.179]  So what they do is she.
[01:37:33.965 --> 01:37:35.445]  She imprisoned people wrongfully.
[01:37:36.066 --> 01:37:37.966]  This is all documented when she was the Attorney General.
[01:37:37.986 --> 01:37:39.226]  She's a truly wicked person.
[01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:40.647]  She puts Hillary Clinton to shame.
[01:37:40.947 --> 01:37:42.347]  So if it's them, it's fine.
[01:37:42.707 --> 01:37:44.908]  But I don't have to like the guy.
[01:37:44.928 --> 01:37:46.848]  I don't have to respect the guy.
[01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:51.389]  But in our two-party system, you have to vote who you vote for.
[01:37:51.409 --> 01:38:00.155]   But I don't see how He stops a repeat of what happened in 2020 because they didn't run a serious game to prevent that.
[01:38:00.255 --> 01:38:05.158]  All of this was not... Well, it's true that he is just surrounded like his latest social media site.
[01:38:05.178 --> 01:38:06.299]  I know the inside scoop on it.
[01:38:06.319 --> 01:38:07.240]  It's like a pump and dump.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:08.921]  None of it's going to work.
[01:38:08.961 --> 01:38:12.103]  It's all... And I'm not trying to put down them.
[01:38:12.203 --> 01:38:12.964]  I wish it was successful.
[01:38:12.984 --> 01:38:13.424]  No, I am.
[01:38:13.564 --> 01:38:13.784]  I am.
[01:38:13.965 --> 01:38:14.185]  I am.
[01:38:14.405 --> 01:38:18.288]  I don't like people who scam vulnerable... I don't think he even knows that.
[01:38:18.308 --> 01:38:19.909]  It's just he has these scammers all around him.
[01:38:20.029 --> 01:38:22.771]  Well, but again, people would apologize for him.
[01:38:23.391 --> 01:38:25.273]  And here's what I've always told my people.
[01:38:25.553 --> 01:38:27.454]  I even tweeted this out when they, oh, you're criticizing Trump.
[01:38:27.814 --> 01:38:29.436]  I said, I have made mistakes in my life.
[01:38:29.896 --> 01:38:33.979]  Have I ever once told you to apologize for my mistakes?
[01:38:34.359 --> 01:38:34.619]  Never.
[01:38:34.819 --> 01:38:35.640]  You know what I tell people?
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:35.940]  You know what?
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.921]  I'm an imperfect person.
[01:38:37.241 --> 01:38:38.322]  I've made a lot of mistakes.
[01:38:38.762 --> 01:38:39.963]  It's up to God to judge me.
[01:38:40.043 --> 01:38:43.866]  If you have a problem with anything I've ever said or done, then I completely understand that.
[01:38:44.146 --> 01:38:45.327]  You don't need to apologize to me.
[01:38:45.347 --> 01:38:45.947]  I'm a grown man.
[01:38:46.248 --> 01:38:47.809]  Donald Trump has everybody.
[01:38:49.170 --> 01:38:52.172]  No, we don't make rationalizations for men, full grown men.
[01:38:52.592 --> 01:38:53.252]  In their 70s.
[01:38:53.472 --> 01:38:54.753]  That's emphatizing them.
[01:38:54.773 --> 01:38:56.554]  That's making them as if they're out to be children.
[01:38:56.974 --> 01:39:01.276]  He has people, oh yeah, you better, it reads like a bad debt collection letter.
[01:39:01.596 --> 01:39:03.216]  Oh, your name's missing from this list.
[01:39:03.236 --> 01:39:05.217]  Your access is gonna be suspended.
[01:39:05.597 --> 01:39:07.018]  Looks like debt collection letters.
[01:39:07.078 --> 01:39:08.018]  It's a total scam.
[01:39:08.379 --> 01:39:09.579]  He's scamming vulnerable people.
[01:39:09.599 --> 01:39:10.679]  I have a problem with that.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.641]  And I've said that a hundred times, I've had a problem with that.
[01:39:13.661 --> 01:39:15.662]  I don't care, oh, somebody's gonna unfollow me on Twitter.
[01:39:15.982 --> 01:39:17.242]  Oh no, somebody's not gonna like me.
[01:39:17.282 --> 01:39:19.263]  I'm gonna lose whatever, clout.
[01:39:19.323 --> 01:39:20.103]  I don't, I don't care.
[01:39:20.464 --> 01:39:27.573]   My job, Is in your job, because we're on a different level than Trump, leaders of men.
[01:39:28.034 --> 01:39:31.339]  And to show men, this is why we have to stand steadfast in what we do.
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.162]  This is the higher calling God gave us.
[01:39:33.442 --> 01:39:33.823]  You know what?
[01:39:33.863 --> 01:39:34.584]  We're under attack.
[01:39:34.604 --> 01:39:34.925]  You know what?
[01:39:34.945 --> 01:39:35.726]  We've made mistakes.
[01:39:36.307 --> 01:39:36.768]  We own it.
[01:39:37.108 --> 01:39:38.288]  We keep moving forward.
[01:39:38.768 --> 01:39:41.569]  We have to show the next generation of men, this is how you live.
[01:39:41.869 --> 01:39:43.009]  Don't live like Donald Trump.
[01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:44.550]  Don't betray your supporters.
[01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:48.070]  Don't back down in those moments that test your character.
[01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:49.411]  You gotta push forward.
[01:39:49.451 --> 01:39:50.471]  He fired General Flynn.
[01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.891]  He didn't pardon the non-violent protesters.
[01:39:52.931 --> 01:39:53.832]  What about the Assange thing?
[01:39:54.072 --> 01:39:57.793]  He told them, Assange, release it, and then he lets them rot in solitary confinement?
[01:39:58.213 --> 01:39:59.133]  That pisses me off.
[01:39:59.433 --> 01:39:59.853]  It should!
[01:40:00.153 --> 01:40:02.174]  And there's no way to apologize for it.
[01:40:02.214 --> 01:40:03.754]  People have to vote for who they're gonna vote for.
[01:40:04.514 --> 01:40:05.114]  Fine with me.
[01:40:05.154 --> 01:40:07.195]  Well, that's the problem is the other side is so evil.
[01:40:07.236 --> 01:40:10.757]  I don't think Trump's bad, but I do think he's kind of a spoiled rich kid.
[01:40:10.777 --> 01:40:11.958]  He's smart in many ways.
[01:40:12.338 --> 01:40:16.200]  It's just that he's so pampered and he's got those sycophants around him.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:16.881]  That's the problem.
[01:40:17.321 --> 01:40:19.482]  Yeah, he grew up in affluence.
[01:40:19.682 --> 01:40:24.665]  He grew up with playing with house money, massive wealth and connections from his own dad.
[01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:26.506]  He's never been truly tested.
[01:40:26.546 --> 01:40:28.107]  He's never been truly through the crucible.
[01:40:28.407 --> 01:40:29.007]  He's never been brought back.
[01:40:29.027 --> 01:40:29.407]  We'll be right back.
[01:40:29.427 --> 01:40:30.428]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:48.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide, and wow, I've got the studio audience of Mr. and Mrs. Tim Pool over here, and they're going to be in studio with us soon, and they want to ride shotgun with Sarnovich, and he's been kind enough to stay with us as well into the fourth hour, so that's coming up here in about 20-30 minutes.
[01:40:48.299 --> 01:40:54.061]  We'll get Tim over here, and maybe get Tim's lovely, really smart, awesome wife as well, the little power behind the throne over there.
[01:40:56.082 --> 01:41:00.507]   Anyways, You were getting into Trump here, and I think it's important.
[01:41:00.527 --> 01:41:05.853]  That's what Tucker Carlson told me, and it's no secret that Tucker and I are friends, I'll leave it at that, but we do talk quite a bit.
[01:41:06.373 --> 01:41:09.597]  And I think Tucker used to think I was this immoral, psycho, evil person.
[01:41:09.617 --> 01:41:12.541]  He told me this ten years ago when he first came to visit, went to dinner and stuff and hung out.
[01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:16.945]  And then he saw the stuff come true and thought, okay, he's kind of crazy, but he means well.
[01:41:17.285 --> 01:41:19.107]  And then now he's like, oh my God, it was all true.
[01:41:19.487 --> 01:41:20.929]  And then he's kind of taking it next level.
[01:41:20.969 --> 01:41:27.134]  So he tried to get Trump to, to, to, to stand up to the Russiagate stuff and did not fire Flynn and all those things.
[01:41:27.154 --> 01:41:34.141]  Cause they talk every day, as you know, and he's finally would just scream at Trump and, and Trump still wouldn't listen to him when he was giving him the same advice you were giving him.
[01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:35.923]  And I think that's the frustration I hear in your voice.
[01:41:36.687 --> 01:41:39.750]  Yeah, it's primarily a moral character issue.
[01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:44.113]  It's primarily an issue of having been tested, having been smashed around.
[01:41:44.154 --> 01:41:45.595]  And Trump has lived a very easy life.
[01:41:45.995 --> 01:41:48.077]  Born into opulence, rich dad.
[01:41:48.137 --> 01:41:49.058]  I don't begrudge that.
[01:41:49.078 --> 01:41:52.641]  I hope I'm trying to give a life like that for my daughter, but I still have adversity for them.
[01:41:52.981 --> 01:41:57.405]  So my daughter, she's, right when she turned four, she's doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu right away.
[01:41:57.805 --> 01:41:59.447]  My three-year-old, we already show her stuff.
[01:41:59.787 --> 01:42:00.728]  Everything's very physical.
[01:42:00.748 --> 01:42:02.068]  Your daughter's got quite a presence.
[01:42:02.128 --> 01:42:03.329]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:04.249]  She's the older one.
[01:42:04.289 --> 01:42:05.170]  She's got charisma.
[01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:06.150]  We're building that already.
[01:42:06.511 --> 01:42:13.234]  And part of that is I know that she lives in a nicer life than I lived as a kid, but I train them always to be tough, to have adversity.
[01:42:13.654 --> 01:42:15.095]  Okay, we're going to run down the hallway.
[01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.796]  We're going to race all the time.
[01:42:16.816 --> 01:42:23.681]   Because you have to teach people mental toughness from an early age because that's what Drive you.
[01:42:23.701 --> 01:42:25.243]  There's a great quote that I love.
[01:42:25.483 --> 01:42:29.048]  It's attributed, I think, Mark Devine, and we don't know who it came from.
[01:42:29.068 --> 01:42:30.169]  It could be a military saying, though.
[01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:32.272]  It says, you don't rise to the occasion.
[01:42:33.033 --> 01:42:35.656]  You fall to your lowest level of training, right?
[01:42:36.037 --> 01:42:36.818]  Everybody has.
[01:42:36.978 --> 01:42:37.859]  Think about that for a minute.
[01:42:37.879 --> 01:42:39.642]  You don't rise to the occasion.
[01:42:39.982 --> 01:42:41.063]  You fall to your training.
[01:42:41.724 --> 01:42:46.147]  Everyone has it in their own mind from the superhero movies that you get.
[01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:47.168]  You're born.
[01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:48.729]  You're found by a mentor.
[01:42:48.769 --> 01:42:50.090]  They give you these magical powers.
[01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:51.692]  The Green Lantern finds the ring.
[01:42:51.972 --> 01:42:56.515]  Spider-Man gets... If you think about the, again, the mythology, because that's what people do is they live by the mythology.
[01:42:56.535 --> 01:42:57.536]  Arthur pulls the sword.
[01:42:57.896 --> 01:42:58.776]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:58.796 --> 01:43:00.657]  And then suddenly you have heroism.
[01:43:00.877 --> 01:43:02.017]  That isn't really how it works.
[01:43:02.417 --> 01:43:06.018]  You pull the sword and then somebody tries to kill you and beat you up and steals the sword.
[01:43:06.158 --> 01:43:08.219]  And then you have to go find the sword again.
[01:43:08.479 --> 01:43:09.979]  That's how it really works.
[01:43:10.019 --> 01:43:15.941]  So people in their own mind think, oh yeah, if somebody right now kicked in the door, I would totally do kung fu moves.
[01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:16.641]  And no, you wouldn't.
[01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:18.182]  You would pee your pants.
[01:43:18.202 --> 01:43:18.762]  You would cry.
[01:43:18.802 --> 01:43:19.342]  You would hide.
[01:43:19.722 --> 01:43:21.103]  Because you don't rise to the occasion.
[01:43:21.123 --> 01:43:22.023]  You fall to your training.
[01:43:22.643 --> 01:43:35.993]  So our duty as men and as I'm training my own daughters is to impose that kind of training, that mental toughness, that fortitude, knowing that you can go farther than you can think you can go, knowing that your brain is going to impose limits on you that it doesn't have.
[01:43:36.494 --> 01:43:37.755]  And then I'm impressed.
[01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:39.216]  How old your older daughter was in her?
[01:43:39.576 --> 01:43:39.816]  Five.
[01:43:40.297 --> 01:43:46.201]  I mean, she had the look of like like a 70 year old smart old woman whenever she was like, I don't want barbecue with daddy.
[01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:51.605]  And she was just like, but the way she said it and looked at everybody was had a lot of confidence way beyond her years.
[01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:52.246]  That's impressive.
[01:43:52.406 --> 01:43:54.848]  Yeah, we're teaching her command presence.
[01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:58.672]  So we're always, like, we go somewhere and I say, Saira, look, eye contact.
[01:43:58.992 --> 01:43:59.733]  Tell them what you want.
[01:43:59.813 --> 01:44:00.754]  No, dad, I'm shy.
[01:44:01.155 --> 01:44:01.635]  Be brave.
[01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:02.135]  All the time.
[01:44:02.456 --> 01:44:02.996]  Mantras.
[01:44:03.016 --> 01:44:05.939]  Well, look at the fake left feminists say, oh, we want to empower women.
[01:44:05.959 --> 01:44:06.900]  But they say, you're victims.
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.181]  Be scared.
[01:44:08.462 --> 01:44:10.764]  Instead of like real patriots, our daughters are incredible.
[01:44:11.164 --> 01:44:12.164]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:44:12.204 --> 01:44:14.205]  I have my daughter in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:44:14.265 --> 01:44:15.545]  I have my little one who's three.
[01:44:15.605 --> 01:44:16.466]  I say, attack.
[01:44:16.906 --> 01:44:18.266]  I want my daughters to be the president.
[01:44:18.286 --> 01:44:20.067]  I want my daughters to have a will to battle axe.
[01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:23.888]  And no conservative Christian ever tried to hurt their daughters.
[01:44:24.228 --> 01:44:24.928]  That's a lie.
[01:44:24.948 --> 01:44:26.409]  The system wants to enslave your daughters.
[01:44:26.829 --> 01:44:28.491]  Well, the system wants to enslave everyone.
[01:44:28.611 --> 01:44:30.472]  Men and women, they just enslave them by different ways.
[01:44:30.492 --> 01:44:35.937]  So the way they enslave men is primarily via the use of mind control and internet pornography.
[01:44:36.238 --> 01:44:40.501]  And the way they enslave women is through the self-victimization mindset.
[01:44:41.022 --> 01:44:43.124]  I can't even look at porn anymore.
[01:44:43.905 --> 01:44:45.205]  Well, it's... I can't even look at it!
[01:44:45.265 --> 01:44:48.786]  There's a karmic cost to it because a lot of them have been trafficked.
[01:44:49.466 --> 01:44:59.088]  And once you realize the karmic cost... So I had a vision one time where when you watch porn, your face is becoming brought into that screen like through the looking glass.
[01:44:59.568 --> 01:45:00.709]  Like Alice in Wonderland.
[01:45:00.929 --> 01:45:03.309]  And then you have the karmic debt of all the suffering.
[01:45:03.349 --> 01:45:05.470]  So you're consuming human karma.
[01:45:05.710 --> 01:45:06.930]  You're consuming negative human karma.
[01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:07.770]  You're involved in a crime.
[01:45:08.110 --> 01:45:08.810]  You're consuming it.
[01:45:08.890 --> 01:45:09.870]  That's what you... You're eating it.
[01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:11.751]  You're not... You think you're pleasuring yourself.
[01:45:11.771 --> 01:45:12.491]  It's like sin-eating.
[01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:14.372]  Yeah, you're death-eating.
[01:45:14.593 --> 01:45:14.793]  Right.
[01:45:14.873 --> 01:45:17.635]  So you think that, oh, this is beautiful, I'm pleasuring myself.
[01:45:17.995 --> 01:45:18.616]  No, you're not.
[01:45:19.036 --> 01:45:22.279]  You're consuming dark karma that's entering you.
[01:45:22.319 --> 01:45:34.109]  Because sex is a ritual between men and women fusing a new creature that a spirit literally comes into, and then to be even involved in something separate with other people that have been trafficked or abused, it becomes satanic.
[01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:37.652]  And so you're taking, it's an inversion again of something holy.
[01:45:38.312 --> 01:45:45.379]  Exactly, and then that takes you over either through literal demons, through dark energy, call it what you will, but you're consuming negative karma.
[01:45:45.419 --> 01:45:48.983]  So I like to just think that I don't want to consume negative karma.
[01:45:49.083 --> 01:45:50.124]  I can't live a perfect life.
[01:45:50.404 --> 01:45:51.285]  I use an iPhone.
[01:45:51.605 --> 01:46:00.534]  The karma attached to using Apple devices, we all know that that becomes part of the death that we have to pay forward because that's based on human suffering.
[01:46:00.994 --> 01:46:01.214]  Right?
[01:46:01.454 --> 01:46:03.635]  So much of the world is based on human suffering.
[01:46:03.655 --> 01:46:05.236]  Yeah, why do they build them in slave factories?
[01:46:05.296 --> 01:46:06.476]  It's not just about greed.
[01:46:06.536 --> 01:46:08.157]  They want it to be a satanic instrument.
[01:46:08.637 --> 01:46:08.837]  Right.
[01:46:08.857 --> 01:46:10.857]  And they want it because they want to create negative karma.
[01:46:10.877 --> 01:46:16.619]  So their role in the world is to create more negative karma because then everybody carries heavier karmic debt.
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.080]  And that's a construct they use as a handle on us.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:19.280]  Right.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.441]  And then we can't ascend.
[01:46:21.221 --> 01:46:24.203]  To the higher levels because now we're all burdened down by this karmic debt.
[01:46:24.223 --> 01:46:30.208]  So every time it looks like we're about to go to a higher level, we get pulled down into the lower level because of all the negative karma.
[01:46:30.568 --> 01:46:34.611]  That's why a lot of the darker entities help people who are doing dark work.
[01:46:35.152 --> 01:46:43.718]  They give them insights and vision because they're able to create more negativity that holds us down and that's why we haven't transcended into a higher level.
[01:46:43.959 --> 01:46:50.604]  They're sucking us into their dimension and now the metaverse is an artificial synthetic subdivision of the third dimension as well.
[01:46:51.284 --> 01:46:53.706]  Yeah, that's why the metaverse is going to be so popular.
[01:46:54.067 --> 01:46:57.389]  Because people are... I mean, we already live in the metaverse, right?
[01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:59.351]  Social media is augmented reality.
[01:46:59.671 --> 01:47:04.616]  Somebody reads something about you on social media, and then they come about it and ask you in real life if that's true or not.
[01:47:04.896 --> 01:47:06.097]  So we already live in the metaverse.
[01:47:06.497 --> 01:47:07.979]  That's why... Absolutely.
[01:47:07.999 --> 01:47:14.204]  Now they want to completely bring you in it, and then people can be tortured and taunted in ways that maybe they're not prepared for.
[01:47:14.244 --> 01:47:17.226]  But you and I are lucky because we're Gen X.
[01:47:18.207 --> 01:47:24.308]  And we don't have a full hold on our minds the way younger people do, but that's coming up.
[01:47:24.328 --> 01:47:28.569]  So we're sort of the last of the Mohicans in terms of having a fully free mind.
[01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:36.631]  It's still a ways till break, but man, how far do you think they're going to push this and go?
[01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:40.872]  I mean, with the poison shots, all of it, it's just, they're already openly attacking everybody.
[01:47:41.992 --> 01:47:44.073]  Well, evil has no limit, right?
[01:47:45.214 --> 01:47:55.187]  They, yeah there's never what Stalin did they want to do here, what Mao did with the Cambodian genocide, Pol Pot did they want to do here, what Hitler did they want to do here.
[01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:56.930]  There's no limit.
[01:47:57.651 --> 01:48:00.154]  That said, evil does because it is evil.
[01:48:01.221 --> 01:48:02.561]  So the root of it is self-destruction.
[01:48:02.581 --> 01:48:04.562]  It is an expiration date.
[01:48:04.622 --> 01:48:08.704]  Yeah, the problem is all the human suffering that happens in between those waves of evil.
[01:48:09.444 --> 01:48:18.567]  And what we have to do is try to prevent the evil from happening or limit the stretch or the length of the wave that's going to happen.
[01:48:19.047 --> 01:48:21.808]  That's why I've got big pictures of waves all over the office.
[01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:28.116]  Yeah, that's probably something coming in from God or the universe telling you that everything is a wave.
[01:48:28.156 --> 01:48:29.678]  Good is a wave, evil is a wave.
[01:48:30.259 --> 01:48:37.729]  The wave of evil is coming and you can't stop it totally, but maybe we can make the wave a little bit less powerful, make it crest a little bit further.
[01:48:37.749 --> 01:48:38.250]  And bend down the hatches.
[01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:39.751]  Yeah, and you have to lean into it.
[01:48:39.771 --> 01:48:43.913]  I've been telling people for a long time is you have to run from evil.
[01:48:44.073 --> 01:48:45.314]  Yeah, you got to face it head on.
[01:48:45.354 --> 01:48:46.675]  You have to fortify your mind.
[01:48:46.715 --> 01:48:48.076]  You have to fortify your body.
[01:48:48.096 --> 01:48:49.256]  It's no joke.
[01:48:49.576 --> 01:48:51.918]  Things are going to get worse because people go, oh, Cernovich.
[01:48:53.439 --> 01:48:57.621]  You're always telling people things are going to get worse, but you're an optimist.
[01:48:58.141 --> 01:48:59.382]  So let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:49:00.062 --> 01:49:02.424]  Well, Mike Cernovich is a smart guy.
[01:49:02.704 --> 01:49:05.526]  Some of the stuff he's telling me behind the scenes is exactly my view on things.
[01:49:05.646 --> 01:49:07.187]  And it's a crazy world.
[01:49:08.187 --> 01:49:11.861]  So, I've got so many questions and so many places to go, but...
[01:49:12.921 --> 01:49:14.322]  Guys, you just gave me that article.
[01:49:14.362 --> 01:49:14.742]  Here it is.
[01:49:14.762 --> 01:49:15.803]  This is so huge.
[01:49:16.302 --> 01:49:22.782]   This is out of Reuters. UK health agency extends gap between infection and shots for children.
[01:49:22.782 --> 01:49:28.061]   And they're now saying that you should wait three months between taking the COVID vaccine
[01:49:28.061 --> 01:49:31.662]   because when you take the second shot it has a massive increase in myocarditis,
[01:49:31.662 --> 01:49:36.063]   as the British Medical Journal said three weeks ago. So this is a big, big deal and Reuters tries
[01:49:36.063 --> 01:49:39.341]   to spin the headline where it doesn't make any sense. But when you actually read into it,
[01:49:39.341 --> 01:49:42.943]   they're saying three months now, not two weeks between shots. What do you make of that?
[01:49:43.981 --> 01:49:46.222]  Well, it's all coming to pass, really.
[01:49:46.262 --> 01:50:00.087]  The lies, the... If you want to look at something interesting before Wikipedia deletes it because there's accidentally truth being there, look at deaths of FIFA players, the amount of deaths among soccer players from 2020-2021 to before that.
[01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:04.971]  Interesting data.
[01:50:05.091 --> 01:50:11.196]  I would like to see people track this objectively because the question is a headline is a headline, right?
[01:50:11.556 --> 01:50:14.678]  We know that athletes are having to leave the season.
[01:50:14.718 --> 01:50:16.600]  We know that they're passing out.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.182]  We know that some of them are dying, but does that happen every year?
[01:50:20.202 --> 01:50:21.223]  There's always been the case.
[01:50:21.343 --> 01:50:22.404]  They're dying every day though.
[01:50:22.744 --> 01:50:22.885]  Yeah.
[01:50:22.905 --> 01:50:32.579]   Well, we need to look at the numbers and nobody's tracking the numbers and that's an interesting research project for people to undergo because It seems like it's more.
[01:50:32.599 --> 01:50:35.963]  It does seem like it's more, but we don't know.
[01:50:36.043 --> 01:50:37.224]  We need to have a baseline rate.
[01:50:37.264 --> 01:50:46.234]  If we want to be logical, we have to say, well, how many professional athletes dropped dead or had heart conditions in 2019, 2018, 2017, and then compare that to 2020, 2021.
[01:50:46.294 --> 01:50:49.337]  Some investigative reporters are saying it's a 66% increase.
[01:50:50.999 --> 01:50:52.220]  Some other numbers that have been broken down.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.741]  That wouldn't surprise me from what I'm seeing.
[01:50:53.761 --> 01:50:54.761]  I mean 66 times.
[01:50:55.041 --> 01:51:10.751]  You can go on Wikipedia and you can look up FIFA player deaths and they list a prominent number of yeah so yeah the FIFA I think it's FIFA or F-I-F-A I think they had a list that somebody posted where you can see how many people have died.
[01:51:10.951 --> 01:51:11.431]  It's a 500% increase.
[01:51:13.112 --> 01:51:14.393]  It wouldn't surprise me.
[01:51:14.473 --> 01:51:16.235]  I wouldn't really be surprised by any of that.
[01:51:17.716 --> 01:51:24.983]  They put on these shots now that can make you have a heart attack or have heart swelling, but then on the news like, it's a conspiracy, no one ever got sick.
[01:51:25.664 --> 01:51:26.785]  These corporations are crazy.
[01:51:27.285 --> 01:51:29.027]  Well, they want profit.
[01:51:29.047 --> 01:51:30.629]  Pfizer sold what?
[01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:31.549]  Vioxx, didn't they?
[01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:32.731]  Was that Pfizer?
[01:51:32.751 --> 01:51:37.655]  Pfizer's had to enter into non-prosecution agreements with the government before.
[01:51:38.556 --> 01:51:39.877]  Pharmacy, I mean Big Pharma.
[01:51:40.317 --> 01:51:44.019]  So I want to know when the left, I thought it was interesting, when did the left come from?
[01:51:44.459 --> 01:51:52.764]  There's the iron triangle, there's that revolving door of you work at the pharmaceutical company, then you work at the FDA, and you get stock options.
[01:51:53.165 --> 01:51:55.906]  They don't care anymore, so now they all love Big Pharma.
[01:51:55.946 --> 01:51:57.747]  They're moving to technology.
[01:51:58.348 --> 01:52:01.009]  All I can, here's how I look at this situation.
[01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:05.732]  They are, they being the left, they are taking the vaccine.
[01:52:06.909 --> 01:52:08.010]  They clearly believe in it.
[01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:12.232]  We'll see what happens, because if they're wrong, their numbers will dwindle.
[01:52:12.572 --> 01:52:18.495]  And if they're right, then the numbers of patriotic freedom-loving Americans will dwindle.
[01:52:18.575 --> 01:52:19.035]  And we'll see.
[01:52:19.075 --> 01:52:21.216]  And it's like a religion to them.
[01:52:21.296 --> 01:52:24.058]  It's like they really believe in the cult.
[01:52:24.798 --> 01:52:28.300]  Joe Rogan said that the other night on Tim Poole's show, that the left has really become a cult.
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.261]  And Joe always saw himself as very liberal, but he says, these aren't liberals.
[01:52:31.581 --> 01:52:32.182]  This is a cult.
[01:52:33.493 --> 01:52:34.796]  Well, they're called the Big Pharma.
[01:52:35.097 --> 01:52:36.741]  They have hate.
[01:52:36.801 --> 01:52:38.385]  That's what fundamentally comes down to us.
[01:52:38.766 --> 01:52:40.390]  The left has always been collectible.
[01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:44.710]  And if you're a collectivist, you're always going to have to hate the other.
[01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:49.331]  And now they have the new other, which is anybody who's unvaccinated.
[01:52:49.371 --> 01:52:51.732]  They want to ban people from not being vaccinated.
[01:52:51.752 --> 01:52:54.873]  When I read their stuff, though, it shows it's sad.
[01:52:54.993 --> 01:52:57.793]  I saw a doctor who claims he's a data-driven MD.
[01:52:58.314 --> 01:53:01.274]  He claims that he doesn't take his son to the grocery store.
[01:53:01.634 --> 01:53:06.016]  The three-year-old son, he has never been to a grocery store because he's so afraid of COVID.
[01:53:06.036 --> 01:53:07.216]  And I think about the children.
[01:53:07.796 --> 01:53:08.437]  We're suffering.
[01:53:08.738 --> 01:53:13.027]  If left-wingers, if Chris Hayes wants to, I want all the liberal media people to take the vaccine.
[01:53:13.408 --> 01:53:14.330]  I fully encourage that.
[01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:16.515]  I agree, but then we've got to feel for their children.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:17.620]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:29.088]  I feel bad for the children who are going to be used as test subjects so that Pfizer can't enrich itself with no risk of liability because you can't sue Pfizer for the vaccine side effects.
[01:53:29.128 --> 01:53:31.370]  The whole world is being turned into a giant laboratory.
[01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:34.031]  I'm sure you've seen this, but it's even in the Washington Post.
[01:53:34.432 --> 01:53:37.273]  Pfizer got secret agreements with more than 50 governments, including the U.S.
[01:53:37.313 --> 01:53:37.614]  government.
[01:53:37.874 --> 01:53:39.975]  We know because the documents have now been released.
[01:53:40.455 --> 01:53:45.739]   And Pfizer has the power to silence government officials And that the U.S.
[01:53:45.779 --> 01:53:51.423]  military bases and others have been pledged as collateral in case there's any liability.
[01:53:51.804 --> 01:53:53.385]  But they're also given liability waivers.
[01:53:53.725 --> 01:53:55.746]  And then, of course, Brazil wouldn't go along with it.
[01:53:56.187 --> 01:53:57.528]  Secret vaccine contracts.
[01:53:57.568 --> 01:54:02.772]  So the government did treaties with Pfizer to basically give them dictatorial power.
[01:54:02.792 --> 01:54:06.995]  And that's why the Pfizer CEO goes on TV and says, oh, no, the FDA will approve it for children.
[01:54:07.015 --> 01:54:08.676]  And then they do it because he's in command.
[01:54:09.386 --> 01:54:14.269]  He's in command and whether the FDA says it's going to take 55 years before they release the full data.
[01:54:14.449 --> 01:54:15.030]  It's a farce.
[01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:16.031]  Honestly, it's a farce.
[01:54:16.931 --> 01:54:17.812]  Beyond a farce.
[01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:19.013]  And then that ties into this.
[01:54:19.373 --> 01:54:20.814]  They exercise in federal court.
[01:54:20.914 --> 01:54:22.215]  They say we are in control.
[01:54:22.675 --> 01:54:22.835]  Right.
[01:54:22.875 --> 01:54:24.216]  And they said so 55 years.
[01:54:24.736 --> 01:54:31.521]  So my perspective on all of this is, and I've said this before, you just have to separate yourselves from these people.
[01:54:31.901 --> 01:54:32.922]  That's the way I live my life now.
[01:54:32.962 --> 01:54:37.225]  I don't know that I have, I used to have a lot of friends who were liberals, a lot of friends who were Democrats.
[01:54:37.725 --> 01:54:45.208]  I don't know if I have a friend anymore who is, because they're part of a cult, a demonic cult, and I don't want to be associated with that.
[01:54:45.228 --> 01:54:56.312]  So I'm focusing on building up relationships with people who, and friends of mine have the vaccine, by the way, because if you're, you know, if you're an obese person, then you're playing the odds either way.
[01:54:56.352 --> 01:54:58.052]  So you're going to have a harder experience with COVID.
[01:54:58.332 --> 01:55:08.177]   So I actually got in a lot of trouble with my reader base because I said, look, man, if you're not actively taking care of your health, And you get COVID, it's gonna be a bad ride.
[01:55:08.237 --> 01:55:13.141]  And sure, it does work for three or four months, but after six months, you have lower immunity than you had before.
[01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:15.562]  It's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy drug.
[01:55:15.583 --> 01:55:17.044]  That's why I would say nobody should take it.
[01:55:17.584 --> 01:55:19.726]  But I get it, you're just saying, hey, it's your choice, just don't make it.
[01:55:19.806 --> 01:55:23.909]  Yeah, I have friends who are vaccinated, and I'll be friends with the vaccinated people.
[01:55:24.209 --> 01:55:32.075]  I have friends who are Trump supporters who are vaccinated because they have weight issues or they're immunocompromised from some other condition, and COVID could really be a problem.
[01:55:32.495 --> 01:55:35.876]  Oh, I mean, I had it and people got mad at me saying it was deadly.
[01:55:35.956 --> 01:55:37.256]  I felt like a gorilla was on my chest.
[01:55:37.316 --> 01:55:38.157]  It was the worst sickness.
[01:55:38.177 --> 01:55:39.357]  I almost killed my dad.
[01:55:40.477 --> 01:55:41.617]  And it was damn real.
[01:55:42.278 --> 01:55:42.538]  Yeah.
[01:55:42.738 --> 01:55:44.678]  I'd never had felt like this was not the flu.
[01:55:44.698 --> 01:55:45.298]  This was not a cold.
[01:55:45.318 --> 01:55:46.559]  This was synthetic.
[01:55:47.039 --> 01:55:47.279]  Yeah.
[01:55:47.319 --> 01:55:50.260]  Two friends of my wife, they're the healthiest people we know.
[01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.460]  And it's a husband-wife couple.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.861]  The husband's super physically active, really lean.
[01:55:56.261 --> 01:55:57.561]  He said it doesn't feel natural.
[01:55:57.862 --> 01:56:04.324]   He said, I thought that The lab theory of COVID was crazy until I got it, according to him.
[01:56:04.364 --> 01:56:05.845]  This is him talking, me talking for him.
[01:56:06.445 --> 01:56:07.746]  He said it doesn't feel natural.
[01:56:07.886 --> 01:56:08.466]  It felt terrible.
[01:56:08.506 --> 01:56:09.047]  Everybody says that.
[01:56:09.087 --> 01:56:12.328]  I mean, when you're 50, almost 50 like I am or whatever, I've been sick, you know, I know what it feels like.
[01:56:12.689 --> 01:56:13.369]  Oh, this is the flu.
[01:56:13.409 --> 01:56:13.869]  This is a cold.
[01:56:13.909 --> 01:56:16.470]  This is like, this is, this is new.
[01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:18.552]  I mean, and oh, at 3, 3 a.m.
[01:56:18.572 --> 01:56:24.014]   is when I, and that's what the doctor, Bartlett told me, he said, at 3 a.m.
[01:56:24.034 --> 01:56:25.455]  is when you have the real trouble breathing.
[01:56:25.495 --> 01:56:26.075]  Don't panic.
[01:56:26.476 --> 01:56:27.876]  Just go do the modesto down steroid.
[01:56:27.897 --> 01:56:31.479]  Then, exactly at 3 a.m., it would just... This stuff's designed.
[01:56:31.999 --> 01:56:33.580]  We know it's a synthetic spike protein.
[01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:35.442]  It's replicating nanotech.
[01:56:35.462 --> 01:56:42.166]  That's why Big Tech and Big Pharma are merging, is because these new, quote, vaccines are really just digital manufactured nanotech.
[01:56:43.007 --> 01:56:45.669]  So that's why the two are merging, because this is programming.
[01:56:46.289 --> 01:56:55.356]  Well, the two most important books that I think people should read to understand the current zeitgeist would be both Neil Stevenson books, Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.
[01:56:55.696 --> 01:57:02.621]  That's because Neil Stevenson is a sci-fi writer who's very beloved by people in tech, and Snow Crash is about the metaverse.
[01:57:03.001 --> 01:57:07.225]  So a lot of what is happening now in tech came from Neil Stevenson's work.
[01:57:07.305 --> 01:57:08.446]  They're able to bring the tech in.
[01:57:08.466 --> 01:57:12.570]  So in Snow Crash, everybody plugs in to what is essentially the metaverse.
[01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:21.259]  And then the Diamond Age is all about nanotechnology and nanobots, nanocontamination, killing people via nanobots, having your blood explode via nanobots.
[01:57:21.559 --> 01:57:24.061]  So I've told people for years, you should read Snow Crash.
[01:57:24.762 --> 01:57:30.805]  And the Diamond Age, because that's almost like a playbook for what tech is doing and where the technology is headed.
[01:57:30.825 --> 01:57:39.048]  And I'm sure you saw two weeks after the Davos Group announced it a month ago, two weeks ago, the USDA says, we're going to start spraying food with nanotech for your safety.
[01:57:39.408 --> 01:57:40.729]  It's just, it's a revolution.
[01:57:41.389 --> 01:57:48.756]  Even though when General Flynn said that they would be doing that a month ago, there was a whole outcry from the media where they said, General Flynn is a conspiracy theorist.
[01:57:48.796 --> 01:57:52.139]  He's claiming that they're going to put nanotechnology in salad dressing.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:58:00.487]  And that became a whole... That's the world we're in now, where they attack you for saying what they're going to do, and then they do it and they pretend like they didn't attack you.
[01:58:00.507 --> 01:58:01.008]  There it is, USDA.
[01:58:01.028 --> 01:58:02.009]  We can put it back on screen.
[01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:03.010]  Alright!
[01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:05.191]  Mike Cernovich is kicking ass.
[01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:06.131]  Cernovich.com.
[01:58:06.191 --> 01:58:12.593]  Tim Pool joins the fray on the other side for an hour and 15 minutes more of live transmission.
[01:58:12.613 --> 01:58:16.375]  Then, the mighty Owen Schroyer takes over 3 p.m.
[01:58:16.415 --> 01:58:19.776]  Central, The War Room at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:20.636 --> 01:58:29.364]  If a hurricane is smashing into the Gulf Coast and I make the prediction that it's going to cause flooding, that's not a prediction.
[01:58:30.005 --> 01:58:33.108]  You know it's a hurricane, you know it's got a lot of water it's going to dump, it's going to cause flooding.
[01:58:33.588 --> 01:58:44.959]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for years, that's going to starve tens of millions to death.
[01:58:45.379 --> 01:58:46.839]  And now it all happened.
[01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:52.301]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation, and the UN that ordered it is running around being the savior.
[01:58:53.121 --> 01:58:55.702]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:57.682]  And now the first world is becoming the third world.
[01:58:57.762 --> 01:58:59.163]  So, listen to me now.
[01:58:59.463 --> 01:59:05.885]  We've got the highest quality storable foods at the lowest price you're going to find, ready to ship to you right now at 10% off until November 15th.
[01:59:05.925 --> 01:59:08.105]  But after that, the prices are going up.
[01:59:08.205 --> 01:59:10.226]  We cannot suppress prices anymore.
[01:59:13.408 --> 01:59:22.115]  You know what Mark Zuckerberg's doing?
[01:59:22.875 --> 01:59:38.087]  It came out more than five years ago in his own company documents when whistleblowers warned the world that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook and to be depressed and alone so that avatars or fake computer identities would be their only friends.
[01:59:38.507 --> 01:59:41.528]  Thus taking full control of the user's mind.
[01:59:41.788 --> 01:59:59.555]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out with Facebook claiming ownership of the metaverse and buying up hundreds of VR companies and now trying to force its users and employees to solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg.
[02:00:00.015 --> 02:00:01.717]  And the organizations that he works with.
[02:00:02.277 --> 02:00:07.303]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses here in the third dimension.
[02:00:07.643 --> 02:00:18.314]  And to do that, they're creating an artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control of our bodies and our minds.
[02:00:18.754 --> 02:00:20.897]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[02:00:21.697 --> 02:00:30.766]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness is forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[02:00:31.526 --> 02:00:43.818]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension and not just enslave us, but finally completely destroy us and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[02:00:44.458 --> 02:00:46.419]  This is beyond the satanic ritual.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.702]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction.
[02:00:49.722 --> 02:00:52.984]  Because this is actually happening in the real world today.
[02:00:53.564 --> 02:00:55.545]  And we have discovered their secrets.
[02:00:55.585 --> 02:00:57.126]  We've discovered how to stop them.
[02:00:57.346 --> 02:01:06.411]   And we have put it all together in an easy to understand system that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists, but to transcend to the next level.
[02:01:06.411 --> 02:01:10.411]   It's so important for all of you that already know this in April
[02:01:10.411 --> 02:01:12.411]   and have already witnessed this for yourselves to understand.
[02:01:12.411 --> 02:01:16.411]   You are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level
[02:01:16.411 --> 02:01:22.411]   so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity before they get trapped
[02:01:22.411 --> 02:01:25.411]   in this artificial matrix system the globalists are building.
[02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.411]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.621]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[02:01:29.961 --> 02:01:38.788]  Documents came out in 1990, from the late 1970s, where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar to The Matrix.
[02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:41.070]  And all that information is now public.
[02:01:41.431 --> 02:01:53.641]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses, not just holding us in the third dimension, but actually creating an artificial slave system so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[02:01:54.241 --> 02:01:55.542]  Humanity are not robots.
[02:01:55.782 --> 02:01:59.483]  No matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this.
[02:01:59.543 --> 02:02:02.224]  But they are trying to turn us into robots.
[02:02:02.804 --> 02:02:06.746]  That's why in December of 2021 we are launching Reset Wars.
[02:02:07.166 --> 02:02:33.612]   Find out more information at ResetWars.com ResetWars.com Mike Cernovich, riding shotgun, and now coming into the fray, Tim Pool of Temcast, one of the most popular podcasts in the world, and a guy that when I was being censored, nobody else would have me on, had me on and had the courage to do it, so we really appreciate Tim Pool.
[02:02:34.553 --> 02:02:38.095]  And he also, of course, famously on Joe Rogan, defended me to the head of Twitter.
[02:02:38.115 --> 02:02:40.237]  That was epic and amazing, and that was a big turning point.
[02:02:40.637 --> 02:02:41.798]  So thanks for the life raft.
[02:02:41.838 --> 02:02:44.099]  He told me, hey, I didn't do it for you, I did it for everybody's free speech.
[02:02:44.479 --> 02:02:45.100]  We're all in this together.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.581]  So Tim Pool is here with us.
[02:02:47.486 --> 02:02:47.986]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:02:48.006 --> 02:02:49.087]  It's good to have you here.
[02:02:49.147 --> 02:02:50.047]  How do you like it in Austin?
[02:02:50.828 --> 02:02:53.109]  I have eaten nothing but brisket this past week.
[02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:54.289]  That is not a joke.
[02:02:54.329 --> 02:02:56.971]  That is true and serious, and I've loved every bite.
[02:02:58.652 --> 02:03:00.233]  You've been having some epic interviews, too.
[02:03:00.673 --> 02:03:02.254]  Yeah, Tuesday.
[02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:07.336]  We're going to talk about Rittenhouse some next hour, but you want to talk about Metaverse, and that's where we were with the great Cernovich.
[02:03:07.616 --> 02:03:14.260]  Well, yeah, you just played that clip, and I basically said, the Metaverse will happen, and everyone's going to celebrate it.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:26.707]  You know, we can sit here right now and talk about the intrusions on our individual rights, our liberties, our worldview, our values, but I think about how the fact, I mean, look, we got social security numbers, right?
[02:03:26.727 --> 02:03:31.130]  We are literally tagged and numbered by the government and we all just, we don't complain about that every day, do we?
[02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:36.133]  We don't go, isn't it crazy the government has given us a number, you're born and then... You're already in the metaverse.
[02:03:36.713 --> 02:03:42.877]  Well, what I mean is, I mean, first of all, the way we use Facebook, the way we use social media, we're hooked in, we're wired.
[02:03:43.297 --> 02:03:45.678]  But I think, you know, Mark Zuckerberg is going to do the metaverse.
[02:03:45.999 --> 02:03:47.119]  If it's not him, it's somebody else.
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:53.663]  You give it 10, 15, 20 years, the next generation, they're going to grow up living in that world and they're not going to understand why we opposed it.
[02:03:54.164 --> 02:03:54.684]  Absolutely.
[02:03:54.704 --> 02:03:57.686]  So we see it as alien and nauseating and a hellhole.
[02:03:58.627 --> 02:04:03.352]  And not real, because when you travel to Estonia and you pick up the energy, when you go there via the metaverse, it's not the same thing.
[02:04:03.833 --> 02:04:09.840]  It's a lie, but then our children forced into this, that's what the whole reset is, making us zoom in and do all this.
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:10.861]  They won't know the difference, Mike.
[02:04:11.802 --> 02:04:13.964]  If we let them in, yeah, it'll be indistinguishable from reality.
[02:04:14.605 --> 02:04:20.089]  And of course the joke, not the joke, but Elon and others, we could already be in a metaverse and not know it.
[02:04:20.590 --> 02:04:22.711]  How do we know we're at base reality right now?
[02:04:22.891 --> 02:04:25.754]  Because of visions, next level consciousness.
[02:04:26.114 --> 02:04:28.696]  I mean I've definitely had next level consciousness experience.
[02:04:28.936 --> 02:04:29.697]  Isn't that an argument?
[02:04:30.097 --> 02:04:31.318]  That we're not in base reality?
[02:04:31.918 --> 02:04:37.603]  No, that's the third dimensional reality is what you're talking about, but there's the higher dimensions.
[02:04:38.362 --> 02:04:43.284]  So would it not be that we originate in the higher dimensions and right now we are trapped in a lower dimension?
[02:04:43.304 --> 02:04:48.907]  Yes, well this body is a manifestation of our incredible will in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th of the 11th dimension.
[02:04:49.407 --> 02:04:55.487]   Or it could be that we're souls and we were brought in here to play this reality because
[02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:59.726]   the reality we came from is so beautiful and divine that it got boring.
[02:04:59.726 --> 02:05:00.726]  So then we needed...
[02:05:00.726 --> 02:05:01.726]  No, that's what it is.
[02:05:01.726 --> 02:05:02.726]  Exactly, that's what I saw.
[02:05:02.726 --> 02:05:03.726]  But then that would mean that we're in the metaverse.
[02:05:03.726 --> 02:05:04.726]  That's right.
[02:05:04.726 --> 02:05:05.726]  We're already in the metaverse.
[02:05:05.726 --> 02:05:06.726]  You're right.
[02:05:06.726 --> 02:05:07.726]  The third dimension is a metaverse.
[02:05:07.726 --> 02:05:08.726]  Right.
[02:05:08.726 --> 02:05:09.726]  It could be.
[02:05:09.726 --> 02:05:10.726]  This entire universe is a simulation.
[02:05:10.726 --> 02:05:11.726]  Could be.
[02:05:11.726 --> 02:05:12.726]  God created it, it's holding together.
[02:05:12.726 --> 02:05:13.726]  It could be.
[02:05:13.726 --> 02:05:15.327]   Well, now they know with the different devices that there is a force five times stronger
[02:05:15.327 --> 02:05:17.445]  holding this universe together.
[02:05:17.445 --> 02:05:18.445]  Here's what I know.
[02:05:18.445 --> 02:05:24.327]   I know that through experiences I've had with various plant medicines, that wherever you
[02:05:24.327 --> 02:05:26.886]  go feels more real in this world.
[02:05:27.389 --> 02:05:30.631]  So people go, because that's why I hate when people go, oh, ayahuasca is a hallucinogen.
[02:05:31.052 --> 02:05:32.232]  This is the hallucination.
[02:05:32.673 --> 02:05:37.916]  When you go to the other dimensions, you immediately feel, I'm back home.
[02:05:38.096 --> 02:05:39.017]  Everybody talks about this.
[02:05:39.057 --> 02:05:39.537]  Exactly.
[02:05:39.657 --> 02:05:40.618]  This is familiar.
[02:05:40.878 --> 02:05:41.499]  So this world.
[02:05:41.519 --> 02:05:42.199]  Total completion.
[02:05:42.319 --> 02:05:42.479]  Yeah.
[02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:44.521]  This world is the hologram.
[02:05:44.541 --> 02:05:45.982]  This world is a hallucination.
[02:05:46.542 --> 02:05:47.983]  We belong somewhere else.
[02:05:48.303 --> 02:05:50.864]  Now, why we're here, that's the riddle of existence, right?
[02:05:51.184 --> 02:05:52.105]  Why were we put here?
[02:05:52.365 --> 02:05:53.886]  What are we supposed to do while we're here?
[02:05:53.906 --> 02:05:55.327]  Well, we had to be battle-tested.
[02:05:55.827 --> 02:05:58.408]  Yeah, that's the riddle, so we're already in the metaverse, in my view.
[02:05:58.428 --> 02:06:00.769]  Well, this is a torture device, so we can decide who we are.
[02:06:01.209 --> 02:06:02.210]  What if it's just a video game?
[02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:03.030]  Right.
[02:06:03.070 --> 02:06:04.131]  What if it's just entertainment?
[02:06:06.175 --> 02:06:08.557]  No, we haven't decided what it is.
[02:06:08.577 --> 02:06:10.620]  It's war training.
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:16.165]  It's a war training grid for a giant war going on that we've not been let into yet.
[02:06:16.205 --> 02:06:18.347]  But I've got to look at it.
[02:06:18.548 --> 02:06:18.808]  Wow.
[02:06:19.569 --> 02:06:21.471]  There's a bunch of different ways you can look at it.
[02:06:21.491 --> 02:06:22.011]  Let's just say this.
[02:06:23.092 --> 02:06:25.694]  I agree that my brain releases a lot of DMT when I sleep.
[02:06:25.714 --> 02:06:27.595]  Everybody does, but I release large amounts of it.
[02:06:27.936 --> 02:06:29.917]  Every night I go to sleep is like longer than my life here.
[02:06:30.477 --> 02:06:33.219]  And so every night is just like total, you know, just all over the place.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:45.828]  I'm just, I'm just thinking about how insane the news cycle has been over the past few years to the point where people have jokingly said the writers of reality, you know, are reusing jokes because like the same things are happening and it's like getting stale or whatever.
[02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:46.489]  Yeah, the timeline.
[02:06:46.849 --> 02:06:54.072]  It's, yeah, like, oh, this is the craziest timeline where the Large Hadron Collider slams the particles, warping Earth into the Trump dimension where he's president.
[02:06:54.492 --> 02:06:59.014]  And I'm like, if that's your argument, it sounds like base reality is probably super routine and boring.
[02:06:59.054 --> 02:07:04.557]  So we created this crazy reality where everything's just shocking and outrageous.
[02:07:04.877 --> 02:07:06.518]  We got this crazy trial going.
[02:07:06.538 --> 02:07:11.700]  Yeah, because at higher levels, things are so complete and controlled, you wouldn't want to go back down into chaos.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:21.923]  Or we're traveling through space already, and because of the long periods of time in between space travel, you have to go somewhere, so you're simulating... To keep your brain up!
[02:07:22.063 --> 02:07:35.106]  Yeah, so we're just here, because I got that idea when Elon Musk was on Joe Rogan, and Elon said, if you play video games because real life can be boring, then imagine how boring the people who create the simulation must be.
[02:07:35.606 --> 02:07:35.806]  Right?
[02:07:36.207 --> 02:07:39.969]  Because to them, we play video games as escapism because real life can be boring.
[02:07:40.389 --> 02:07:45.953]  But if you're doing massive space travel, you have to keep your brain activated like you're plugged into some kind of fluid.
[02:07:46.294 --> 02:07:50.877]  And then you come here and then you wake up and now you're back into space.
[02:07:51.217 --> 02:07:53.819]  Like all the globalist billionaires, obviously none of them are atheists.
[02:07:53.859 --> 02:07:55.460]  They all know that we were designed and built.
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:58.002]  And yes, they believe that we are actually trapped.
[02:07:58.722 --> 02:07:59.142]  I don't think so.
[02:07:59.162 --> 02:08:06.684]  I think that's where you and I, one of the only things we fundamentally disagree on is, I don't think these billionaires are getting direct downloads from the universe and through the higher powers.
[02:08:06.765 --> 02:08:07.405]  I've met more than a few.
[02:08:07.225 --> 02:08:11.305]   They're acting like demons against us so that we don't compete with them in controlling
[02:08:11.305 --> 02:08:12.305]  the future.
[02:08:12.305 --> 02:08:15.144]   They're doing horrible things to us, so I say they're the bad.
[02:08:15.144 --> 02:08:20.305]   I think that's where you and I, one of the only things we fundamentally disagree on is
[02:08:20.305 --> 02:08:24.305]   I don't think these billionaires are getting direct downloads from the universe and through
[02:08:24.305 --> 02:08:25.505]  the higher powers.
[02:08:25.505 --> 02:08:26.904]  I've met more than a few.
[02:08:26.904 --> 02:08:28.423]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:08:28.423 --> 02:08:33.385]   So I think with Bill Gates acts this way, I don't think he's acting via divine machination.
[02:08:33.812 --> 02:08:37.433]  I believe that he's just a normal person who got rich doing what he was doing because he had IQ.
[02:08:37.493 --> 02:08:38.774]  You misunderstood what I said.
[02:08:38.794 --> 02:08:39.034]  Okay.
[02:08:39.054 --> 02:08:39.394]  No, no, no.
[02:08:39.474 --> 02:08:41.635]  Obviously Bill Gates is a low-level demon.
[02:08:42.195 --> 02:08:43.915]  And because he's willing to fill that role, he's there.
[02:08:44.275 --> 02:08:44.795]  I agree with you.
[02:08:44.835 --> 02:08:54.638]  What I'm saying is, a lot of the billionaires that the head of Bank of America years ago said, I believe it's all a simulation, and I used to be an atheist, but now that I look through all the science, something's controlling us, and I want to break out of it.
[02:08:55.018 --> 02:08:58.801]  And I'm saying that that goes back to Lucifer wanting to build his own universe.
[02:08:58.901 --> 02:09:00.362]  I've got an interesting segue for you.
[02:09:01.143 --> 02:09:02.384]  You guys ever watch Stargate SG-1?
[02:09:03.445 --> 02:09:04.205]  No, but you told me about it.
[02:09:04.225 --> 02:09:04.665]  I want to watch it.
[02:09:04.806 --> 02:09:13.032]  There's an episode where there's like a crashed spaceship they find and everyone's consciousness is removed from their body in deep space travel because the consciousness would degrade.
[02:09:14.373 --> 02:09:17.896]  So that was an interesting concept, but it made me think of something else from the show called Tritonin.
[02:09:18.576 --> 02:09:24.779]  In the plot of the show, there's a medicine that when you take it, it boosts your immune system, but destroys it.
[02:09:25.139 --> 02:09:27.680]  So as soon as you stop taking it, you die from all these viruses.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:29.021]  And that's what this does.
[02:09:29.041 --> 02:09:32.002]  Well, I heard you guys talking about that, and this just kind of made me want to hear it.
[02:09:32.162 --> 02:09:34.423]  Back in two minutes, Tim, I want to hear about this.
[02:09:34.924 --> 02:09:37.505]  Wow, I got Mike Cernovich and Tim Pool in the studio.
[02:09:37.585 --> 02:09:39.886]  And the other night, I was on with Tim Pool and Joe Rogan.
[02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:42.167]  This is a cool timeline.
[02:09:42.407 --> 02:09:43.067]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:43.588 --> 02:09:44.208]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:09:44.758 --> 02:09:45.559]  Say HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:09:45.959 --> 02:09:47.980]  TimCast.com.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.201]  Cernovich.com.
[02:09:49.361 --> 02:09:50.481]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:51.762]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:09:51.802 --> 02:09:54.244]  I don't post on my website anymore, so there's nothing really there.
[02:09:54.504 --> 02:09:54.964]  Absolutely.
[02:09:54.984 --> 02:09:55.845]  So what's the best place for you?
[02:09:56.065 --> 02:09:56.985]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:09:57.005 --> 02:09:57.786]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:09:59.747 --> 02:10:01.368]  This is the one ring.
[02:10:02.249 --> 02:10:03.389]  Isildur's Ring.
[02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:04.750]  Here we are.
[02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:05.971]  You are Tim Pool.
[02:10:06.713 --> 02:10:08.574]  Getting into the nature of reality.
[02:10:08.614 --> 02:10:10.755]  Pretty powerful stuff, but please continue.
[02:10:11.196 --> 02:10:13.797]  These timelines, I better watch Stargate SG-1.
[02:10:13.897 --> 02:10:14.978]  It's an amazing show.
[02:10:15.178 --> 02:10:17.139]  It's like what's actually happening now.
[02:10:17.359 --> 02:10:18.460]  I recently started watching this.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:20.621]  You're going to love some of these storylines.
[02:10:20.901 --> 02:10:22.802]  And this stuff is all written in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[02:10:23.022 --> 02:10:24.163]  Sci-fi TV show.
[02:10:24.203 --> 02:10:25.283]  I think it was on Showtime.
[02:10:26.004 --> 02:10:29.746]  And one episode, they discover this planet.
[02:10:30.106 --> 02:10:31.787]  Basically, they open a portal and go to different planets.
[02:10:32.147 --> 02:10:36.350]   They go to a planet where this race of humans It's like a spice.
[02:10:36.210 --> 02:10:40.529]   something called tritonin and it cures all of their diseases.
[02:10:40.529 --> 02:10:44.489]   They have perfect immune systems, but if they stop taking it, they no longer have an immune
[02:10:44.489 --> 02:10:45.489]  system and they die.
[02:10:45.489 --> 02:10:47.029]  It's like a spice.
[02:10:47.029 --> 02:10:48.029]  Is that what spice is like?
[02:10:48.029 --> 02:10:49.029]  Yeah.
[02:10:49.029 --> 02:10:50.029]  Yeah.
[02:10:50.029 --> 02:10:52.189]   So, so a lot of people point out, you know, you guys are talking about the vaccines and
[02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:55.729]   how afterwards there's a like waning, waning general immune system.
[02:10:55.729 --> 02:10:56.729]  I've not read that.
[02:10:56.729 --> 02:10:57.729]  I don't know.
[02:10:57.729 --> 02:10:58.729]  It's confirmed.
[02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:59.729]  Yeah.
[02:10:59.910 --> 02:11:08.999]  There's another episode of Stargate where they go to this planet, it's agrarian, and there's an advanced race of humans that are harvesting crops through the Stargate portals.
[02:11:10.100 --> 02:11:10.800]  They found it, there it is.
[02:11:12.045 --> 02:11:13.286]  That's Stargate SU-1, that's right.
[02:11:13.826 --> 02:11:15.007]  And so check this out, you're gonna love this one.
[02:11:15.407 --> 02:11:23.532]  They go to this planet, and they wonder why there's only a few farmers, but they're primitive, and the advanced humans are harvesting all the crops.
[02:11:23.793 --> 02:11:25.033]  And you guys found it, keep showing it.
[02:11:25.454 --> 02:11:31.618]  Check this out, they find underground, like industrial era civilization, but it's destroyed.
[02:11:32.198 --> 02:11:39.763]  They find a newspaper, and it says something in Gaelic, because the plot of the show is that different primitive humans travel across the universe through these gates.
[02:11:40.243 --> 02:11:44.166]   Long story short, They're trying to figure out what caused the collapse of the civilization.
[02:11:44.386 --> 02:11:48.629]  Well, when the advanced aliens came to their planet, there was a flu pandemic.
[02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:52.632]  So they offered up a vaccine that would cure the pandemic.
[02:11:52.872 --> 02:11:53.332]  Wow.
[02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:54.693]  And it also sterilized all of them.
[02:11:55.674 --> 02:12:00.637]  That is not a statement about the real world, but have you guys also seen Utopia on Amazon?
[02:12:00.917 --> 02:12:01.478]  Same story.
[02:12:01.778 --> 02:12:02.338]  Same story.
[02:12:02.438 --> 02:12:03.059]  But this one's great.
[02:12:03.539 --> 02:12:18.825]   A tech billionaire who's concerned about overpopulation, who makes fake meat, Stages of fake pandemic so that he can rush through a vaccine without approval in a short amount of time and the vaccine actually sterilizes everybody and Amazon canceled it after season one.
[02:12:19.366 --> 02:12:22.466]  My understanding is they canceled it because people were getting freaked out.
[02:12:22.947 --> 02:12:23.907]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:12:23.947 --> 02:12:28.308]  And what's even crazier is you realize it was made 15 years ago in the UK.
[02:12:28.428 --> 02:12:28.548]  Yeah.
[02:12:28.928 --> 02:12:30.969]  And then then got picked up by Amazon.
[02:12:30.989 --> 02:12:34.890]  So I went and watched the original UK one or at least a synopsis like a boil down.
[02:12:35.310 --> 02:12:37.131]  And it was what's happening 15 years ago.
[02:12:37.852 --> 02:12:39.675]  But what's happening today?
[02:12:39.715 --> 02:12:41.999]  So yeah, it's Bill Gates, fake meat, everything.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.388]  It's just so weird that there's art imitates life imitates art all over the place.
[02:12:46.468 --> 02:12:47.229]  Why do they do that?
[02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:48.111]  Why do they do that?
[02:12:48.993 --> 02:12:53.214]  No, I don't actually think... Oh, I think it's pretty good programming.
[02:12:53.494 --> 02:12:55.034]  Well, I'll tell you one more thing about Utopia.
[02:12:55.855 --> 02:13:01.996]  The plot of the show is that someone with privet information creates a comic book that exposes what they're doing.
[02:13:02.716 --> 02:13:07.537]  And the funny thing about that show is the show itself is effectively functioning as that comic book.
[02:13:07.557 --> 02:13:08.638]  Yeah, they're telling you what they're doing.
[02:13:08.918 --> 02:13:10.198]  It's just the weirdest thing.
[02:13:10.698 --> 02:13:14.903]  I think it's more that you draw inspiration from it rather than it being predictive programming.
[02:13:15.403 --> 02:13:18.607]  I think I'm more of a believer in culture than I am conspiracy.
[02:13:19.528 --> 02:13:26.604]   By that I mean if you're in if you were in tech All these big founders will say, oh, Neal Stephenson's my favorite author.
[02:13:27.084 --> 02:13:32.247]  So when Neal Stephenson writes Snow Crash, which is really about the metaverse, I don't think it's predictive programming.
[02:13:32.307 --> 02:13:38.911]  I think it's people thinking, wow, that could be really cool if we could create an alternative reality based on this book that I read.
[02:13:38.931 --> 02:13:41.092]  I totally agree with you.
[02:13:41.112 --> 02:13:50.238]  That's what I'm saying, is the globalists know that we're God, little g, we're able to build whatever we imagine, so they put out the science fiction knowing that becomes the dreams of humans, that becomes reality.
[02:13:50.698 --> 02:13:53.019]  Yeah, I don't... I just think they're writing stories.
[02:13:53.079 --> 02:13:56.260]  I don't know that it's necessarily as A to B like that.
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:58.401]  I think it's just... Well, I... Right.
[02:13:58.641 --> 02:14:09.064]  I mean, when I fought the Globalists for 28 years, I believed early on that they would launch their operations, and because I told people it was coming, then we would be able to defeat them, because we'd be on record beforehand.
[02:14:10.805 --> 02:14:12.426]  Yeah, that's... So I planned it.
[02:14:12.687 --> 02:14:13.347]  Okay, okay.
[02:14:13.387 --> 02:14:15.609]  Well, then maybe they're planning it too.
[02:14:15.789 --> 02:14:26.757]  I think it's more organic than that, and I think that a lot of what you did was warning people of bad things to come, but that's more creating culture than it is doing predictive programming.
[02:14:26.977 --> 02:14:32.582]  Explain culture versus conspiracy when we come back in 60 seconds with Tim Pool and Mike Cernovich.
[02:14:32.622 --> 02:14:36.565]  TimCast.com and... HoaxTheMovie.com.
[02:14:36.785 --> 02:14:37.165]  That's right.
[02:14:37.185 --> 02:14:37.646]  We'll be right back.
[02:14:38.217 --> 02:14:38.958]  Have you watched Dune yet?
[02:14:39.799 --> 02:14:41.201]  Have you seen it yet?
[02:14:41.442 --> 02:14:44.881]   Let's talk about Dune first, then we'll talk about the big Rittenhouse developments.
[02:14:44.881 --> 02:14:45.881]  Have you seen it yet?
[02:14:45.881 --> 02:14:46.881]  I walked out of the theater.
[02:14:46.881 --> 02:14:47.881]  Why?
[02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:48.881]  [Groaning]
[02:14:48.881 --> 02:14:49.881]  You walked out?
[02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:50.881]  We gotta talk about that.
[02:14:50.881 --> 02:14:51.881]  [Groaning]
[02:14:51.881 --> 02:14:59.721]   You know, that's got like hundreds of millions of views, people remixing that short thing.
[02:14:59.757 --> 02:15:05.440]  So I'm recording my own chant music in Sardaukar that I'm going to release soon.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:06.120]  Nice.
[02:15:06.281 --> 02:15:06.841]  I'm not joking.
[02:15:07.581 --> 02:15:08.162]  Alright.
[02:15:08.222 --> 02:15:10.283]  I just want to have fun with it, but you didn't think it was good?
[02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:11.790]  No.
[02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:13.711]  I walked out of the theater halfway through.
[02:15:14.391 --> 02:15:15.531]  It was grating.
[02:15:16.572 --> 02:15:17.072]  It was grating.
[02:15:17.092 --> 02:15:22.754]  There were scenes that were redundant, and I didn't understand why they told me the same thing twice, and there were other things they glossed over.
[02:15:23.234 --> 02:15:27.136]  I think if you're a fan of Dune, you were excited to watch its amazing cinematography.
[02:15:28.016 --> 02:15:32.238]  But I was too confused, because it was just like...
[02:15:33.278 --> 02:15:34.499]  It was very sterile.
[02:15:34.979 --> 02:15:36.140]  Yeah, yes.
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:42.664]  But at the same time, if you know the stuff behind it, because the book's really good, the one they made in the 80s, I mean, you know, was well done.
[02:15:42.704 --> 02:15:44.025]  It had weird stuff that wasn't part of the book.
[02:15:44.305 --> 02:15:46.107]  But this is all a metaphor for the real world.
[02:15:46.747 --> 02:15:49.549]  Well, when I watch films, I don't like dialogue.
[02:15:49.649 --> 02:15:51.390]  I like landscapes and I like scenes.
[02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:52.211]  Me too.
[02:15:52.351 --> 02:15:58.055]  And that's what I loved most about it is, I don't, if I want dialogue, I'm gonna read a book, right?
[02:15:58.815 --> 02:16:08.846]  If I want to watch a film, I want an immersive experience, and the way they would do the psychedelic graphics with the red colored sand breathing over, I felt it was an immersive experience.
[02:16:09.246 --> 02:16:19.396]  The scene of the, where they're sacrificing people and putting blood on the little soldiers, there's all these little cinema, the cinemagraphy was so good.
[02:16:20.257 --> 02:16:26.242]  Yeah, yeah, the chanting was so wild, the desert scenes, and that's what I loved best about it.
[02:16:26.262 --> 02:16:27.383]  I wish I'd have seen it in the theater.
[02:16:27.403 --> 02:16:29.405]  Oh, you gotta see it in the theater.
[02:16:29.445 --> 02:16:30.947]  Yeah, I wanna see it in the theater.
[02:16:30.967 --> 02:16:31.507]  It's okay, it's okay.
[02:16:31.547 --> 02:16:34.510]  I mean, it is a little cathedral-like.
[02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:36.652]  I felt like I'm in a different universe.
[02:16:37.172 --> 02:16:38.954]  In the theater I was in, people were falling asleep.
[02:16:39.634 --> 02:16:40.895]  Interesting.
[02:16:40.915 --> 02:16:42.155]  There were very few people in the theater.
[02:16:42.676 --> 02:16:44.397]  The ones that were there were like slumped over.
[02:16:45.057 --> 02:16:49.880]  I was just sitting there and just thinking to myself like, I just feel like nothing is happening.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:52.161]  You're so analytical, Poole, is the issue.
[02:16:52.821 --> 02:16:55.823]  The archetypes were very spiritual and very powerful.
[02:16:56.463 --> 02:16:56.743]  Perhaps.
[02:16:56.943 --> 02:16:58.024]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:58.645 --> 02:17:05.650]  My only work I got to watch in the theater, and I want to do it on just a little bit of mushrooms, just enough.
[02:17:05.710 --> 02:17:06.551]  Okay, I agree.
[02:17:06.811 --> 02:17:08.893]  Because you wanted to take ayahuasca.
[02:17:08.933 --> 02:17:10.254]  We should take mushrooms and go see it.
[02:17:10.394 --> 02:17:10.734]  Yeah, we should.
[02:17:10.754 --> 02:17:11.395]  No, let's do it today.
[02:17:11.615 --> 02:17:18.040]  We eat a calf and a stem, and watch it do, and just sit there and let the whole... It's called Joe Rogan.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:22.483]  Let the whole world... No, I don't... See, I don't do anything.
[02:17:22.503 --> 02:17:23.163]  I'm just joking.
[02:17:23.184 --> 02:17:23.784]  It's a family show.
[02:17:23.804 --> 02:17:24.084]  No, no, no.
[02:17:25.245 --> 02:17:27.106]  No, no, I mean, I do think it's interesting.
[02:17:27.126 --> 02:17:30.028]  I'm very, like, uh, don't drink, don't smoke.
[02:17:30.048 --> 02:17:31.088]  Have you ever taken hallucinogens?
[02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:32.729]  Nope.
[02:17:32.749 --> 02:17:34.671]  So family show, it's good you did that.
[02:17:35.091 --> 02:17:39.173]  I drink very, very, very rarely, like once a year, twice a year maybe.
[02:17:39.433 --> 02:17:44.576]  Once you do it for, I don't like the term hallucinogen or psychedelic, I call it plant medicine.
[02:17:45.337 --> 02:17:53.842]  Once you do it and you go inward, so the way to do it is you put on an eye mask, you take just enough to tip you over, but not so much that you're fully gone.
[02:17:54.742 --> 02:17:57.604]  And then you'll be surprised at what kind of trauma you find.
[02:17:58.065 --> 02:17:59.486]  Toxic experiences.
[02:17:59.926 --> 02:18:05.831]  Emotions start to flow up and then your spiritual channels become more open and you learn about yourself.
[02:18:06.171 --> 02:18:06.871]  You cry.
[02:18:06.931 --> 02:18:07.972]  It's a beautiful experience.
[02:18:08.072 --> 02:18:09.633]  I can't recommend it enough.
[02:18:09.713 --> 02:18:13.877]  If people are going to do it, the problem is a lot of people like take acid or something in their apartment.
[02:18:13.957 --> 02:18:14.917]  I'm so opposed to that.
[02:18:14.937 --> 02:18:15.418]  Or they're young.
[02:18:17.159 --> 02:18:18.500]  Watching MTV or television.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:18.920]  You don't want that.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:19.500]  It's nature.
[02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:20.780]  It opens you up to God.
[02:18:20.861 --> 02:18:22.161]  And I'm not saying take it, folks.
[02:18:22.201 --> 02:18:27.483]  That's why it has a bad reputation is people go, oh yeah, you know, I dropped acid at a Phish concert.
[02:18:27.503 --> 02:18:29.204]  Well, that's not what I'm talking about here.
[02:18:29.784 --> 02:18:41.989]  You're talking about using medicine, which is a completely different... Well, you read Ezekiel and you read like John on the Isle of Patmos and they said the angel came and gave me this and I took it and it was sweet in my mouth but bitter in my stomach and then they...
[02:18:43.007 --> 02:18:44.608]  I mean, it's obvious what's going on there.
[02:18:45.009 --> 02:18:45.129]  Right.
[02:18:45.169 --> 02:18:46.550]  Yeah, you're blasting off.
[02:18:46.670 --> 02:18:48.772]  And then as you do blast off a little bit.
[02:18:48.792 --> 02:19:01.582]  Yeah, I definitely want to get you down to Costa Rica or Peru or to a sanctioned Native American church just due to the... because I only do it in places where it's, you know, fully sanctioned because it's a family show and everything.
[02:19:02.343 --> 02:19:07.728]  But I think you would be really surprised, especially now that you've given up alcohol and you've been through so much.
[02:19:08.368 --> 02:19:15.451]  It would open it up, but again, that's why I think there's a stigma attached to these compounds, because people act like they're fun.
[02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:23.854]  If you do plant medicine right, it could be the worst night of your life, because you're gonna go to hell, in a way, the hell of your own mind.
[02:19:24.094 --> 02:19:27.155]  You're gonna confront the parts of you that you're hiding from.
[02:19:27.455 --> 02:19:30.356]  Some people go, oh yeah, I did some mushrooms and went to a concert.
[02:19:30.376 --> 02:19:37.079]  Well, that's all cute and everything, but did you go look in yourself, in the darkness within you, and confront that shadow?
[02:19:37.859 --> 02:19:39.320]  That's not a fun night.
[02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:41.721]  What if you confront the shadow and it takes you over is the problem.
[02:19:42.401 --> 02:19:44.783]  Well, it already took you over because it's already there.
[02:19:44.823 --> 02:19:45.623]  No, no, I agree.
[02:19:45.823 --> 02:19:46.163]  I'm just saying.
[02:19:46.183 --> 02:19:46.984]  But you'll be tempted.
[02:19:47.044 --> 02:19:47.744]  Yeah, you'll be tempted.
[02:19:47.764 --> 02:19:48.624]  You'll go on a full adventure.
[02:19:48.644 --> 02:19:51.846]  Well, let me say, you better, if you're ever doing this, folks, consult your physician.
[02:19:51.946 --> 02:19:56.068]  And you definitely need to not be around very nice people, not any type of manipulative people.
[02:19:56.288 --> 02:19:57.749]  Have you seen Fantastic Fungi yet?
[02:19:57.769 --> 02:19:59.790]  It's a good movie on the trends of this kind of stuff.
[02:19:59.830 --> 02:20:03.972]  Explain the science, because they admit, Prozac and stuff, you know, on average makes you kill yourself.
[02:20:04.192 --> 02:20:04.873]  Those are bad drugs.
[02:20:04.913 --> 02:20:06.954]  But mushrooms with PTSD, everything, it's magic.
[02:20:07.714 --> 02:20:12.137]  They've, I mean, I was just at a gala for a veterans charity, because everything I advise is legal, by the way.
[02:20:12.157 --> 02:20:13.537]  I don't carry mushrooms in my pocket.
[02:20:13.558 --> 02:20:14.058]  You're a lawyer.
[02:20:14.418 --> 02:20:20.802]  Yeah, so everything that, and I'm a target of these forces, so I'm super conscientious on how I conduct myself.
[02:20:21.462 --> 02:20:25.825]  And I was just at a charity gala for a veterans group that I helped raise over $100,000 for earlier this year.
[02:20:28.366 --> 02:20:57.761]   And what they're doing is you're taking guys, veterans especially, who have been completely broken through war, through trauma, a lot of them have unresolved childhood trauma, and they're using MDMAs, the one they're studying now a big time, but they're also using the psilocybin, they're also using ayahuasca, they're having these transformative experiences because what we're finding with a lot of veterans that I've met, and I don't want to breach anything anyone's told me, is We'll just say that the hardest men in the world probably were molested as kids.
[02:20:58.621 --> 02:21:02.022]  And what we're learning is that that's why you became hard.
[02:21:02.363 --> 02:21:11.286]  So you're a kid, you get abused, you block out that abuse, and then you tell yourself, I'm going to become so strong that that can never happen to me.
[02:21:11.866 --> 02:21:17.628]  So the strongest people you see in the world have often suffered the most, but that trauma still remains within them.
[02:21:17.668 --> 02:21:20.649]  Well, I wasn't molested, but I got beat up a bunch.
[02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:23.911]  I actually like that.
[02:21:24.512 --> 02:21:31.456]  I mean, I went through a process and I became more loving afterwards, but I actually liked being hardened, and that made me who I am.
[02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:38.501]  The fact that I don't fear people, I like pain, and it was never a masochist, but now I can deal with it because I've already been hurt really bad.
[02:21:38.521 --> 02:21:39.842]  I actually embrace that.
[02:21:40.282 --> 02:21:41.043]  I transcend it.
[02:21:41.083 --> 02:21:48.188]  I don't want to be in the office of this big, powerful killer because I want to be strong, but I'm saying it's an attribute that's there that gives me understanding.
[02:21:48.368 --> 02:21:51.909]  Well, but then at that point in your life, you become strong.
[02:21:51.929 --> 02:21:59.892]  The unresolved trauma is still there, and it manifests itself in various ways, so that's where... And then now I'm going to try to stop the globalists from hurting more people.
[02:22:00.172 --> 02:22:10.375]  Or you want to go inward and find the true powers in your heart, and the true power is that realizing that you have that speed and you have that fortitude, but you don't have to live in strength.
[02:22:10.395 --> 02:22:14.496]  You can live in a state of love, you can live in a state of your heart, but you have to go deep within.
[02:22:14.516 --> 02:22:19.198]   So these medicines, they take you Within, and you can't run.
[02:22:19.218 --> 02:22:27.121]  I remember I was on one experience, and I would open my eyes to try to get away from what I was seeing inside, and the voice was like, you can't escape.
[02:22:27.701 --> 02:22:30.582]  You can't run from yourself anymore, and here's what I'm going to show you.
[02:22:30.622 --> 02:22:36.864]  And then you're like, oh my God, and there's all these things that you're encountering, that negative karma that you put in the world, the trauma that you caused.
[02:22:36.884 --> 02:22:40.666]  See, for me, it's just the universe just opens up and just, and just love.
[02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:43.765]  But you have unresolved trauma.
[02:22:43.765 --> 02:22:44.604]  Oh, I've done it, yeah.
[02:22:44.604 --> 02:22:49.145]   And then what the medicines do is they take you inside the parts of yourself that make,
[02:22:49.145 --> 02:22:52.565]   I thought this was dumb, by the way, so just on record when people say things,
[02:22:52.565 --> 02:23:00.286]   oh yeah, deals, I just thought in my own mind, you're just weak, because the way that I live my life
[02:23:00.286 --> 02:23:02.244]  is you're either weak or you're strong.
[02:23:02.227 --> 02:23:03.667]  And if you're weak... You wrote books about that.
[02:23:03.707 --> 02:23:07.930]  Yeah, if you're weak, you're pathetic, and I don't like you, and I want you to be around you because there's a stench.
[02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:10.651]  And then I realized, well, that was my own insecurity.
[02:23:10.671 --> 02:23:11.351]  Right?
[02:23:11.371 --> 02:23:13.152]  Because I, in my own mind, had said, okay, I'll become strong.
[02:23:13.172 --> 02:23:15.133]  There's also the inverse where they make you a victim.
[02:23:15.173 --> 02:23:18.215]  You're not saying become a victim, you're saying transcend the victimhood.
[02:23:18.275 --> 02:23:22.317]  Well, you become strong, and then you turn inward to find out what drove you through there.
[02:23:22.677 --> 02:23:26.019]  And then you become connected to your heart, and that connects you to soul and to God.
[02:23:26.419 --> 02:23:28.780]  And then you can become even stronger.
[02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.240]  By being connected to the infinite.
[02:23:30.761 --> 02:23:33.741]  Right, and you open up parts of yourself that you didn't know you had.
[02:23:34.462 --> 02:23:38.383]  And that's what the medicines do, is they work on your heart rather than on your mind.
[02:23:38.403 --> 02:23:40.784]  Because neither of you need any work on your minds, right?
[02:23:40.864 --> 02:23:43.184]  Nobody would say, oh, these people aren't intelligent people.
[02:23:43.644 --> 02:23:48.346]  But then the question is, are you living only in mind or are you living in heart also?
[02:23:48.426 --> 02:23:55.368]  Because if you only live in heart, you're just so... Well, I know hallucinogens, and Joe will say this, made Joe Rogan a more awake, you know, person.
[02:23:56.443 --> 02:23:59.685]  But they always been really smart, but he used to be a mean son-of-a-bitch.
[02:24:00.065 --> 02:24:01.146]  Well, that would be hard, though.
[02:24:01.186 --> 02:24:02.246]  That's like 20-something years ago.
[02:24:02.286 --> 02:24:04.468]  Yeah, that works on your heart, though, which is different.
[02:24:04.508 --> 02:24:07.829]  So the idea is mind, reading, study, strength.
[02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:13.913]  Heart is the vulnerable part of yourself, the part of yourself that allows you to get hurt because you're no longer afraid to be hurt.
[02:24:13.933 --> 02:24:18.075]  You're no longer afraid to be vulnerable because you know that you can be strong enough to be vulnerable.
[02:24:18.095 --> 02:24:19.336]  Let's talk about it when we come right back.
[02:24:20.919 --> 02:24:24.600]  Well, we've got Tim Pool and Mike Cernovich in studio with us.
[02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:28.702]  I'm Alex Jones and we're talking about what the globalists of the CIA are obsessed with.
[02:24:28.742 --> 02:24:31.403]  You know, literally an MKUltra kidnapping thousands of children.
[02:24:31.423 --> 02:24:32.303]  This is declassified.
[02:24:32.684 --> 02:24:35.865]  Keeping them for years hooked up to audio and visual sensory things.
[02:24:36.245 --> 02:24:38.486]  Putting them inside boxes with TV screens all around them.
[02:24:38.766 --> 02:24:44.970]   Pumping them full of all sorts of hallucinogens to destroy They're underlying human programming and put artificial programming in.
[02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:48.152]  So talking about this is something the enemy's obsessed with.
[02:24:48.493 --> 02:24:49.193]  I'm not pushing it.
[02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:49.974]  I'm not promoting it.
[02:24:50.034 --> 02:25:03.285]  I'm simply saying it's a whole world going on and big pharma is now moving in to try to take over this revolution and then, I guess, genetically engineer the ayahuasca and other things to deploy the molecules they want.
[02:25:03.505 --> 02:25:04.866]  They fear these molecules.
[02:25:04.886 --> 02:25:07.128]  You were just saying something about that, Mike Cernovich.
[02:25:07.708 --> 02:25:11.791]  Well, they want to create the technology and take you away from the plants, which is different.
[02:25:12.211 --> 02:25:16.995]  So, one reason that plant medicine, and I don't call them hallucinogens, and I don't call them psychedelics.
[02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:20.017]  It's like going to a real VR world without the VR.
[02:25:20.137 --> 02:25:30.745]  Yeah, so the reason these plant medicines get a bad reputation is people go, oh yeah, when I was 18, I dropped acid, went to a concert, had a bad experience.
[02:25:30.785 --> 02:25:32.967]  I know a guy who lost his mind or had psychosis.
[02:25:33.547 --> 02:25:36.450]  And the answer is that if you're under 25, you shouldn't even think about it.
[02:25:36.470 --> 02:25:37.791]  That's why they want to do it to their young.
[02:25:38.131 --> 02:25:42.916]  If your brain's not fully developed or you have a history of psychosis, don't even think about this kind of stuff.
[02:25:43.336 --> 02:25:50.203]  That's where the bad reputation comes from, but... That's why only the shaman in the old days in every culture, the high priests would do this because they were ready.
[02:25:50.663 --> 02:26:06.534]  You would take people, and there's a shamanic practice, a counseling session to it, limited numbers of people, and you take people who have lived a full life, and then they want to start developing a little bit more spiritual awareness in a way that you can't obtain it otherwise.
[02:26:06.594 --> 02:26:07.615]  I want to see past the veil.
[02:26:07.975 --> 02:26:29.724]  You wanna go, and you wanna go into yourself, because when I initially was, heard about plant medicines and other things, I was very judgmental of it, because the perception is, oh hey, I'm wearing tie-dye clothes, woo-woo-woo, I've never done nothing in life, I'm a loser, I do drugs, and yeah man, I know the real world, and you people on this world are like losers.
[02:26:30.024 --> 02:26:32.205]  Because they were using it as escapism, right?
[02:26:32.645 --> 02:26:49.213]   That was my perception of it, and then what I found out was, That a lot of people who are not, that are very good people, especially a lot of veterans, have found spiritual healing and emotional healing through these products, but they don't want to talk about it because they're going to be dismissed.
[02:26:49.753 --> 02:26:53.595]  So for me, for example, I can say, oh yeah, I, you know, I, here's what I do.
[02:26:53.615 --> 02:26:54.715]  What are you going to do?
[02:26:54.835 --> 02:26:56.376]  I'll write another hate article on me.
[02:26:56.536 --> 02:26:59.958]  Oh no, there's going to be another thing calling me a fringe lunatic.
[02:27:00.658 --> 02:27:03.361]  Whatever, I don't care, so I have the freedom.
[02:27:03.541 --> 02:27:18.517]  In fact, that's what I was told one time during one of these experiences, is it said, aren't you, and by it, I mean God, a guide, there's a lot going on there, but it says, aren't you so blessed that you can talk about whatever you want to talk about?
[02:27:19.298 --> 02:27:20.678]  And they can't shame you.
[02:27:21.138 --> 02:27:22.419]  They can't do anything to you.
[02:27:23.259 --> 02:27:33.001]  So a lot of people that you would never have expected to have undergone therapeutic treatment with plant medicines aren't there, so then the image is just some loser deadhead.
[02:27:33.061 --> 02:27:35.702]  Plant medicines, if it's done right, it's a reset for the brain.
[02:27:35.722 --> 02:27:38.243]  It helps get rid of some of the programming that's been put in.
[02:27:38.263 --> 02:27:40.263]  You got any comments on this, Poole?
[02:27:41.003 --> 02:27:43.764]  I have never done any kind of hard drugs.
[02:27:44.204 --> 02:28:04.180]  So, throughout my whole life, I've had a lot of people tell me, oh, I'd greatly benefit from this, that, or otherwise, but one of the biggest challenges is that it's hard to have someone who I feel is like less put together trying to advise me on how to do better when, you know, throughout my, I'm younger and I'm starting a business or something, and then some guy's sleeping on a couch and he's like, yo, you gotta do this.
[02:28:04.501 --> 02:28:07.263]  So I've always been... That's what Mike was saying, kind of that thing, huh?
[02:28:07.403 --> 02:28:08.163]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:28:08.203 --> 02:28:09.324]  I've seen the documentaries.
[02:28:09.624 --> 02:28:18.487]  I'm very, very interested in what DMT is all about and extended state DMT experiments and the group experiments.
[02:28:19.167 --> 02:28:29.852]   And I would say, in my experience, having met and talked to a lot of people, It feels to me, and I'll be very careful, that most people would greatly benefit from experiencing mushrooms, in particular psilocybin.
[02:28:30.552 --> 02:28:39.737]  And there's also big stores, I think in Silicon Valley, they've been micro-dosing LSD as they work, because it helps them formulate new ideas and be creative and solve problems.
[02:28:40.848 --> 02:28:57.859]  Yeah, there's a lot of people with microdose psilocybin, too, because it takes you off your equilibrium just enough that you see things differently, but not so much that you're incoherent or buzzed or whatever, so people will take a small amount, and then you go, oh, I didn't realize that this microphone actually looked this way.
[02:28:58.179 --> 02:29:03.402]  You'll notice little details because you have to, because you're thrown off your game just a little bit.
[02:29:03.742 --> 02:29:08.445]  Let me tell you a story, and this is something you guys can all do when you're driving down the highway with your friends.
[02:29:09.466 --> 02:29:13.387]  I'm driving down the road on a road trip and I see a cell phone tower.
[02:29:13.967 --> 02:29:23.150]  Now that's within my perspective because I was very actively, we were doing a software company for mobile apps and I needed to understand cell technology and data.
[02:29:23.610 --> 02:29:27.651]  So we're driving on the highway and I see a cell tower and I thought to myself, you know, I never noticed those before.
[02:29:27.691 --> 02:29:28.551]  I never pay attention.
[02:29:28.591 --> 02:29:30.832]  I never, it's never in my field of vision.
[02:29:30.852 --> 02:29:33.513]  So I said to my friend, what do you see right there on the horizon?
[02:29:33.613 --> 02:29:37.474]  There was an open field and one big cell tower coming up and they said, I don't see anything.
[02:29:37.734 --> 02:29:38.294]  And I said, right there.
[02:29:38.315 --> 02:29:38.695]  It's right there.
[02:29:38.715 --> 02:29:38.995]  It's huge.
[02:29:39.015 --> 02:29:40.116]  It's sticking right out of the ground.
[02:29:40.136 --> 02:29:41.717]  And they said, I know what you're talking about.
[02:29:42.338 --> 02:29:47.642]  They couldn't see the cell phone tower because it wasn't within their mind, their perception.
[02:29:47.662 --> 02:29:48.622]  They just dial it out.
[02:29:48.923 --> 02:29:50.704]  And we're trying to get everybody to actually see everything.
[02:29:50.824 --> 02:29:54.167]  So do you guys know the story, the old urban legend of the shaman in Christopher Columbus?
[02:29:54.766 --> 02:30:00.766]   They couldn't see the ships because their minds had never conceived of such a thing.
[02:30:00.766 --> 02:30:05.766]   So they could physically see the ship, but when it was on the horizon, their mind ignored it.
[02:30:05.766 --> 02:30:09.766]   And it wasn't until the shaman who watched the waves noticed the waves were breaking strangely
[02:30:09.766 --> 02:30:12.766]   and he looked straight up and he said, "Wait a minute, there's something there."
[02:30:13.493 --> 02:30:15.014]  And then he started telling everybody, look right there.
[02:30:15.194 --> 02:30:18.795]  Just like, you know, when I tell my friends about a cell tower they've never experienced before.
[02:30:19.356 --> 02:30:22.257]  You know, when you look at, particularly in California, they disguise them.
[02:30:22.357 --> 02:30:23.358]  But they're very obvious.
[02:30:23.378 --> 02:30:25.699]  It's just a brown metal pole with green antennas.
[02:30:26.139 --> 02:30:27.900]  And people, they really do this.
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:30.101]  And the same thing is true with the oil.
[02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:35.384]  The oil they do in L.A., they have big random towers in like an urban area because they're pumping oil there.
[02:30:36.224 --> 02:30:46.295]  You tell people who don't know this, they just can't understand, until you very slowly break it down, outline it, and say... There's an example, there's a secret nuclear reactor under Austin, and I learned about it.
[02:30:46.756 --> 02:30:52.222]  And it's actually admitted in the literature, it's there, but you tell Austin, I tell you, you know, there's actually two nuclear reactors in Austin.
[02:30:52.502 --> 02:30:55.005]  They just go, no there's not, because they just can't, they just can't even...
[02:30:55.425 --> 02:31:02.148]  Or just to make it very banal, if you get a blue jeep, you're going to drive, oh, there's jeeps everywhere.
[02:31:02.168 --> 02:31:02.488]  That's right.
[02:31:02.808 --> 02:31:05.050]  They were always there, but you weren't focused on it.
[02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:10.592]  So what people do to micro doses, all you're going to do is you're going to notice something that was always there.
[02:31:10.652 --> 02:31:16.955]  But because your mind and the way we filter reality was filtered in a very specific way, you go, oh, wow, I didn't realize that.
[02:31:17.015 --> 02:31:18.656]  Or the light shines a little bit different.
[02:31:19.216 --> 02:31:21.277]  Well, I put these two ideas together.
[02:31:21.377 --> 02:31:23.139]  Verbal fluency can happen, too.
[02:31:23.519 --> 02:31:27.181]  That's why they take those small amounts, which are beneficial.
[02:31:27.321 --> 02:31:28.022]  You know what I think?
[02:31:28.062 --> 02:31:31.724]  A lot of people mention as you get older, time feels shorter, the years get shorter.
[02:31:32.124 --> 02:31:37.187]  It's obviously not that time is slowing down, but your brain is ignoring the routine.
[02:31:37.628 --> 02:31:40.229]  When you're a little kid, every experience is a new experience.
[02:31:40.289 --> 02:31:41.490]  Every meal is a new meal.
[02:31:41.530 --> 02:31:42.891]  Every spice is a new flavor.
[02:31:43.271 --> 02:31:47.214]  But by the time you're in your late 20s or in your 30s, how many steaks have you had in your life?
[02:31:47.794 --> 02:31:53.620]  So you wake up in the morning, you get your coffee, you go to work, and your brain says, this is not important, and just glosses over it.
[02:31:54.141 --> 02:31:57.885]  It's not developing the same kind of relationship as it was when you were a kid.
[02:31:58.286 --> 02:31:58.966]  So here's what happens.
[02:31:59.647 --> 02:32:04.913]  If you're ten years old, in one day, you have a thousand experiences.
[02:32:05.193 --> 02:32:09.498]  Your brain is very excitedly looking at each and every experience, going, look at this, look at this, look at this!
[02:32:10.219 --> 02:32:11.220]  Now you're 35.
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:11.881]  I'm 35.
[02:32:12.461 --> 02:32:17.846]  In one day I have a thousand experiences and my brain goes, done it, done it, done it, done it, oh that's new, done it, done it.
[02:32:18.186 --> 02:32:20.748]  And so at the end of the day I have a stack of only ten things to remember.
[02:32:21.229 --> 02:32:25.192]  So it feels like time flew because my brain ignores so much of the routine.
[02:32:25.633 --> 02:32:31.578]  When you do things like micro-dosing, your brain starts looking back at everything and it just brings you back to that space.
[02:32:31.598 --> 02:32:34.500]  Well, there's a reason Tim Pool's exploding and getting so famous.
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:36.923]  He's super eloquent and smart and so's this guy.
[02:32:37.443 --> 02:32:39.324]  And I'm in hog heaven!
[02:32:39.464 --> 02:32:41.925]  That was really enlightening right there, and so is what you said.
[02:32:42.465 --> 02:32:44.505]  Oh my gosh, we're going to come right back after this break.
[02:32:44.565 --> 02:32:50.868]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, Mike Cernovich is here, and of course we have TimCast.com, and we have the name of your film?
[02:32:50.908 --> 02:32:52.128]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:32:52.368 --> 02:32:53.108]  HoaxedMovie.com.
[02:32:53.428 --> 02:32:55.909]  Let's go back to where you were right there.
[02:32:55.929 --> 02:32:56.769]  That is powerful.
[02:32:57.530 --> 02:33:04.720]   And ResetWars.com, in about a week and a half, we're going to launch uh... about his salvo against the new order and and he was
[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:08.590]   on a per free there to get free videos and updates and and and a whole bunch of
[02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:11.810]   stuff is becoming our the whole big giant rollout
[02:33:11.810 --> 02:33:16.250]   and it's a really piss off the the the demons reset wars dot com so the sign of
[02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:20.440]   a free if you want to get big discounts on the uh... film production information is
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:22.130]   going to be announced soon
[02:33:22.540 --> 02:33:25.682]  But obviously free videos and a lot of other stuff that's going to be there.
[02:33:25.743 --> 02:33:27.704]  So resetwars.com.
[02:33:27.724 --> 02:33:29.945]  We got Mike Cernovich and of course we got Tim Pool here.
[02:33:29.965 --> 02:33:33.468]  Tim, what you were hitting is the best I've ever heard it described though.
[02:33:34.668 --> 02:33:39.370]  And once we went to break, you were going further about your, you know, you've been visiting here, Austin, for a few days.
[02:33:39.690 --> 02:33:40.770]  Seems like a hundred years.
[02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:44.831]  You really articulated why people get Alzheimer's, all of this.
[02:33:44.871 --> 02:33:48.732]  This is one of the secrets to consciousness you're talking about and longevity of the mind.
[02:33:49.452 --> 02:33:51.313]  Living, you know, experiencing life.
[02:33:51.393 --> 02:33:54.374]  So what I was saying, we were in that last segment, we went to the break.
[02:33:55.254 --> 02:33:58.776]  I've been here in Austin since, I believe we came in here on Saturday.
[02:33:59.337 --> 02:34:04.160]  And after I finished my morning show, I was talking to my girlfriend and I was just like, is it, it's only Thursday?
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:05.841]  I feel like we've been here for weeks.
[02:34:06.341 --> 02:34:14.786]  And it's because the experience here, you know, we got an RV, mobile studio, we're meeting people and doing shows we've never done before, eating food in places we've never done before.
[02:34:15.126 --> 02:34:18.849]  So each and every experience is new and my brain is very attentive to it.
[02:34:18.909 --> 02:34:19.489]  Like, where am I?
[02:34:19.529 --> 02:34:19.929]  What is this?
[02:34:19.969 --> 02:34:20.370]  What is that?
[02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:24.313]  But I could remember every single detail from the moment I got here.
[02:34:24.673 --> 02:34:27.016]  I couldn't tell you what happened two weeks ago because it's at my house.
[02:34:27.036 --> 02:34:28.097]  I've been in my house for years.
[02:34:28.197 --> 02:34:34.463]  I wake up, I do my job, I work from home, I go to bed, and I'm just thinking to myself, that routine my brain doesn't care about.
[02:34:34.723 --> 02:34:38.306]   It's like, Tim, You've woken up in this bed a thousand times.
[02:34:38.686 --> 02:34:40.708]  It is not relevant to your memory or your character.
[02:34:41.108 --> 02:34:48.794]  But waking up in Austin in a mobile studio is new and exciting, and my brain has to write this down and be like, we need to understand this new experience.
[02:34:49.274 --> 02:34:51.135]  So it makes time feel longer.
[02:34:51.496 --> 02:34:54.658]  Makes it feel like the days have become longer instead of shorter.
[02:34:55.038 --> 02:34:58.541]  So that's something I try to think about too, making sure you don't fall too much into routine.
[02:34:58.881 --> 02:35:02.384]  As you get older, you always try to explore new things, read new books, watch new shows.
[02:35:03.024 --> 02:35:06.889]  I mean, they know that for 30 years, TV causes Alzheimer's.
[02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:09.192]  Non-active TV.
[02:35:09.212 --> 02:35:11.294]  TV is like a book with text and go here, do that.
[02:35:11.535 --> 02:35:12.496]  That can actually help your mind.
[02:35:12.796 --> 02:35:14.678]  Listening to radio, you have to image what they're saying.
[02:35:14.819 --> 02:35:17.942]  That makes your brain more complex, more connections.
[02:35:18.343 --> 02:35:22.348]  But then when you just start not having the neurons fire, and then you basically die.
[02:35:23.317 --> 02:35:31.624]  Yeah, there was a character in Catch-22 who he wanted to live longer, so everything he did was boring, because when you're bored, boring time stretches out.
[02:35:31.684 --> 02:35:36.969]  And that was his whole shtick, was, I want to feel like life is slowing down, so everything I'm going to do is being boring.
[02:35:37.449 --> 02:35:45.596]  Or there's, if you're doing cardio and you think time flies too fast, hop on an exercise bike and pedal as fast as you can, and you can have some very long minutes in there.
[02:35:45.616 --> 02:35:57.921]   And that's, so one way that I've kind of counteracted that is, I began a gratitude practice every night where I think about everything happened at the day and then I realized, wow, you really, if you're hitting it, you.
[02:35:59.036 --> 02:36:03.118]  What you do is you go A to B, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then you feel like you didn't do anything.
[02:36:03.218 --> 02:36:07.320]  Especially if you're a driven person, there's a paradox of successful people.
[02:36:07.821 --> 02:36:21.128]  The paradox of successful people is you're driven to do a lot due to some kind of internal structure, insecurity, whatever the case might be, and you accomplish so much that by the time you go to bed, you think, what did I even do today?
[02:36:21.528 --> 02:36:22.768]  I just totally wasted my day.
[02:36:22.788 --> 02:36:24.029]  What a loser you are, you know?
[02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:26.910]  And then I started to think, no, no, here's what I did.
[02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:27.730]  Here's what I woke up.
[02:36:28.050 --> 02:36:30.911]  And then I think for the blessings of the challenges of the day.
[02:36:31.231 --> 02:36:32.811]  And you realize you live a full day.
[02:36:32.831 --> 02:36:36.232]  So gratitude practice is very helpful in helping.
[02:36:36.252 --> 02:36:40.814]  My father always said to me, the key to really being a real human is being grateful.
[02:36:42.256 --> 02:36:48.802]  Yeah, it makes you realize that you do a lot in a day and especially again, the harder the charger you are.
[02:36:48.842 --> 02:36:55.048]  That's what I've learned older in life is people make all these assumptions about successful people and they write books.
[02:36:55.109 --> 02:36:58.171]  Here's a successful person not realizing a lot of people.
[02:36:59.238 --> 02:37:04.820]  Became successful due to something internally that maybe isn't that pleasant.
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:07.421]  Maybe you feel like I don't want to be a loser.
[02:37:07.461 --> 02:37:13.903]  So you're driven to be successful because you're running away from loser energy, which is in a way making you positive.
[02:37:13.923 --> 02:37:18.244]  You're making a positive out of a negative, but the negative charge of that energy is still there.
[02:37:18.584 --> 02:37:21.405]  But then you go so fast through the experience.
[02:37:22.185 --> 02:37:34.552]  That you feel like you didn't do anything, and then... No, I totally agree with you, but my enemies messing with me makes me fight harder, and so I am turning a negative into a positive, and I think that's overall good, but you're right.
[02:37:34.572 --> 02:37:40.815]  If it makes you work too hard and then you kill yourself, or kind of run over some people in the process, then it's not good.
[02:37:41.416 --> 02:37:43.277]  But duty is also a motivator.
[02:37:43.557 --> 02:37:47.319]  You know, I'm hearing what you're saying, and I'm thinking about, you know, what's my motivation to wake up?
[02:37:47.339 --> 02:37:48.700]  You know, I do a morning show and a night show.
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:50.501]  It's like, just work, work, work, work, work.
[02:37:51.101 --> 02:37:52.142]  And it feels more like duty.
[02:37:52.783 --> 02:38:00.312]  You know, I'd love to just make a bunch of money and then drive off to the, to, you know, go to the mountains and just get a dog and a satellite dish, play video games all day.
[02:38:00.712 --> 02:38:04.877]  But as much as that's relaxing and might feel good, it doesn't actually feel good to me.
[02:38:05.458 --> 02:38:07.100]  I look at everything that's going on in the world... No, you're right.
[02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:08.742]  It feels good for a little while, then it feels horrible.
[02:38:09.442 --> 02:38:16.265]  So, whenever I have a day off, when you know I got sick recently, and I'm sitting there, I was binging HouseMD, good show, and I was just like, I hate this.
[02:38:16.785 --> 02:38:18.366]  Because I feel like I have a duty.
[02:38:18.866 --> 02:38:24.909]  It's not anger, it's not insecurity, it's not... It's not slavery, it's a program of destiny.
[02:38:25.389 --> 02:38:27.650]  Duty is destiny, destiny is duty.
[02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:33.873]  Because I have a duty to take on these globalists, and I knew it before I even got on air.
[02:38:34.093 --> 02:38:36.715]  You're addicted, you're driven, you can't, you have to do it, you know what I mean?
[02:38:36.815 --> 02:38:37.416]  It's a fire.
[02:38:37.836 --> 02:38:38.536]  Right, right, right.
[02:38:38.937 --> 02:38:44.921]  I wake up and, you know, I read the news and I wonder how this story is so fake.
[02:38:45.422 --> 02:38:47.823]  I need to tell people, make sure they understand they're being tricked.
[02:38:48.264 --> 02:38:58.351]  I need to help them get past these... Exactly, and then the globalists, they love to lie, like they're pushed to lie, whereas I'm like, that's a lie, I gotta show them how it's a lie.
[02:38:58.371 --> 02:38:58.932]  So what is that?
[02:38:59.844 --> 02:39:14.158]  Well, that's, again, each person's individual journey, and it's a beautiful thing that a negative can become a positive, but then on the other hand, you don't want to end up as in an 80-year-old person who, even though you've lived an adventurous life, have you had enough love in your life?
[02:39:14.178 --> 02:39:21.085]  That's what I think about more and more as I get older, and where daughters have really opened up my heart in a lot of ways, which is, do I have enough love in my life?
[02:39:21.145 --> 02:39:22.046]  I have enough success.
[02:39:23.207 --> 02:39:24.888]  People are like, what's your next thing?
[02:39:24.908 --> 02:39:25.509]  What's this and that?
[02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:32.895]  My next thing is opening my heart more to love and to spirituality and to a connection with God and a connection to the next generation.
[02:39:32.935 --> 02:39:38.780]  Well, you remember the movie with Viggo Mortensen, The Road, when he's there with Robert Duvall, and he goes, this child, your son's a God.
[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:41.002]  In this whole evil world, he's the God.
[02:39:41.042 --> 02:39:41.943]  He can be the whole future.
[02:39:42.343 --> 02:39:43.864]  And I look at my son's great.
[02:39:43.884 --> 02:39:44.024]  He's 19.
[02:39:44.125 --> 02:39:44.945]  I love him.
[02:39:45.246 --> 02:39:46.527]  But with my daughters, I've got three of them.
[02:39:46.547 --> 02:39:48.969]  And I look at my four-year-old, and it's like, that's God right there.
[02:39:49.549 --> 02:39:51.750]  I mean, that is a goddess.
[02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:53.611]  That is like literally everything.
[02:39:54.392 --> 02:39:59.394]  Have you guys read that famous trope or quote?
[02:39:59.494 --> 02:40:01.815]  No one on their deathbed ever said, I should have worked more.
[02:40:02.296 --> 02:40:10.200]  There's a meme that goes around where it says, they wrote down everybody they saw passing in the hospital, and they always said, I wish I spent more time with my family.
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:12.461]  I wish I was there for my kids more.
[02:40:12.521 --> 02:40:13.622]  I wish I worked less.
[02:40:14.062 --> 02:40:14.942]  I wish I had more love.
[02:40:14.982 --> 02:40:15.623]  Things like that.
[02:40:16.483 --> 02:40:23.449]  I think that may be the most dire warning for every single person to consider, that family is everything.
[02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:26.211]  That's why it's under attack.
[02:40:26.471 --> 02:40:32.136]  And that's why I do fewer projects, because I got on that grind, and it's a rewarding grind.
[02:40:32.296 --> 02:40:36.919]  You get psychological rewards, emotional rewards, spiritual rewards, often financial rewards.
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:43.525]  So I can definitely, whatever happens, because every day our lives are in danger due to these evil forces in this world.
[02:40:44.266 --> 02:40:47.853]  There's like no question that I've put my daughters first.
[02:40:48.206 --> 02:40:55.512]  And I put, and that's a lot of that too, is the plant medicine showed me that kind of energy where, you know, what are you driven by?
[02:40:55.532 --> 02:40:57.574]  What do you think you value?
[02:40:58.314 --> 02:41:00.756]  But then it'll take you an experience to show you what you value.
[02:41:00.776 --> 02:41:01.397]  So here's what I mean.
[02:41:01.477 --> 02:41:06.341]  If I get a room of guys who are successful and they all have families and I say, what do you value most?
[02:41:06.761 --> 02:41:08.743]  They're all going to say, well, I value my children.
[02:41:08.763 --> 02:41:10.864]  I value my wife.
[02:41:11.245 --> 02:41:12.346]  I value my church.
[02:41:12.886 --> 02:41:15.903]   And then you say, okay, I want to audit your time.
[02:41:16.664 --> 02:41:18.406]  How much time are you spending on your children?
[02:41:19.006 --> 02:41:21.028]  How much time are you spending on your wife?
[02:41:21.108 --> 02:41:22.449]  How much time are you spending on your church?
[02:41:22.810 --> 02:41:23.651]  Complete disconnect.
[02:41:23.831 --> 02:41:26.854]  But I think the argument is, I've got to do this to defend them.
[02:41:27.354 --> 02:41:33.620]  Because I've actually very clear cut, I've got to fight this globalist operation or literally they're going to come forcefully and check my children.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.803]  So believe me, I want to spend time with them and I want to be there.
[02:41:36.843 --> 02:41:38.505]  I hate, but I've got to do this.
[02:41:39.185 --> 02:41:39.405]  It is.
[02:41:39.465 --> 02:41:41.766]  But that's again, that's the burden you bear.
[02:41:41.806 --> 02:41:49.008]  But on the flip side is it doesn't mean it's wrong to work a lot because I grew up poor and I had a great balance.
[02:41:49.028 --> 02:41:49.528]  Everything's balanced.
[02:41:49.648 --> 02:41:54.309]  Yeah, I grew up poor and I wish I had more money as a kid because we had some real bad poverty that doesn't.
[02:41:54.409 --> 02:41:57.090]  There's this mythos that growing up poor makes Bill's character.
[02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:58.430]  And no, you get lucky.
[02:41:58.490 --> 02:42:00.991]  So people who grew up poor get lucky, get out.
[02:42:01.031 --> 02:42:07.514]   And then this whole Horatio Alger mythology that I want my kids to grow up poor because I grew up poor and now I'm not.
[02:42:07.914 --> 02:42:10.996]  No, I've seen what happens on the average to people.
[02:42:11.296 --> 02:42:16.559]  So obviously you want to walk between both worlds, but that is an indictment on how people should spend their time.
[02:42:16.579 --> 02:42:20.662]  But you just, you think about it and you realize, yeah, like what have I, what have I done with my daughter?
[02:42:20.762 --> 02:42:22.243]  Okay, took her to jujitsu today.
[02:42:22.603 --> 02:42:24.184]  We played, I read five books.
[02:42:24.784 --> 02:42:26.285]  My kids know that I work a lot.
[02:42:26.305 --> 02:42:27.166]  No, you're right.
[02:42:27.206 --> 02:42:29.067]  We have to invest in our children or we're done.
[02:42:29.087 --> 02:42:29.567]  Yeah.
[02:42:29.587 --> 02:42:30.048]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:31.028 --> 02:42:34.130]  Alright, I just asked Mike Cernovich to come back on tomorrow and he said yes.
[02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:36.691]  Tim Pool, though, I don't know, he's probably too cool for us.
[02:42:37.192 --> 02:42:39.313]  My brain is melting from the amount of work we've been doing.
[02:42:39.613 --> 02:42:42.014]  You know, we had nine people on the show on Tuesday.
[02:42:42.195 --> 02:42:43.535]  And you've never been more alive.
[02:42:43.996 --> 02:42:45.416]  I know, that's absolutely true.
[02:42:45.777 --> 02:42:48.738]  But I'm gonna need to sleep for a whole day once we're back.
[02:42:48.818 --> 02:42:49.759]  Absolutely, to process it all.
[02:42:49.779 --> 02:42:50.259]  Okay, listen.
[02:42:50.799 --> 02:42:53.521]  I don't give friends guns that I don't care about.
[02:42:53.541 --> 02:42:54.862]  I had my favorite rifle.
[02:42:55.602 --> 02:43:00.886]  A 300 Win Mag, semi-automatic, highest rated gun at 500 yards.
[02:43:00.926 --> 02:43:03.647]  I was shooting patterns like this big, okay?
[02:43:03.988 --> 02:43:05.188]  You couldn't even get it anymore now.
[02:43:05.749 --> 02:43:06.529]  I gave it to Joe Rogan.
[02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:08.290]  He was in the studio a year ago.
[02:43:08.430 --> 02:43:10.031]  Hell, he was in the studio with you just a few days ago with us.
[02:43:10.772 --> 02:43:12.493]  This is the best shooting.
[02:43:12.553 --> 02:43:13.734]  It's a larger handgun.
[02:43:13.754 --> 02:43:15.195]  I've got a smaller one that's also awesome.
[02:43:15.215 --> 02:43:17.496]  Made in Texas, made up in Georgetown, North Austin.
[02:43:17.516 --> 02:43:18.157]  It's an STI.
[02:43:19.293 --> 02:43:25.734]   2011, that's not the year, it's what's called, 2011, Marauder, made in Georgetown, Texas.
[02:43:25.734 --> 02:43:27.212]  And here it is, my friend.
[02:43:27.212 --> 02:43:32.052]   It is unloaded and obviously we're going to send it to your FFL up in West Virginia so
[02:43:32.052 --> 02:43:33.613]  it's all legally done.
[02:43:33.613 --> 02:43:36.253]  But here is your new handgun.
[02:43:36.253 --> 02:43:38.653]  Maybe we can do a document cam shot of this.
[02:43:38.653 --> 02:43:39.653]  Can we get the overhead?
[02:43:39.653 --> 02:43:41.453]  Yeah, let's get the overhead shot on that.
[02:43:41.453 --> 02:43:42.453]  That is Gucci.
[02:43:42.971 --> 02:43:49.520]  Now this, let me tell you, I mean, I can shoot, I can shoot like two inch groups at a hundred yards with this.
[02:43:50.281 --> 02:43:51.022]  Hold on there, Alex.
[02:43:51.082 --> 02:43:53.045]  Let's not, let's not be ADA binger.
[02:43:53.265 --> 02:43:54.787]  Make sure you, you, you check it.
[02:43:54.908 --> 02:43:55.809]  I didn't open it.
[02:43:56.730 --> 02:43:57.190]  I didn't open it.
[02:43:57.370 --> 02:43:59.971]  I'm just saying, you know, we don't want to be an Alec Baldwin here, right?
[02:44:00.011 --> 02:44:01.432]  No, no, that's why I didn't even touch that.
[02:44:01.732 --> 02:44:03.292]  That's a beautiful gun.
[02:44:03.953 --> 02:44:05.273]  I'm just kidding.
[02:44:05.293 --> 02:44:06.854]  That's why we're going to go shatter the shooting.
[02:44:06.874 --> 02:44:10.375]  We got a lot of security guys and we're really safe because, you know, that's the deal.
[02:44:10.395 --> 02:44:18.278]  But here, this is, uh, I'm not the, you know, super gun safety guy myself, but the point is, is that there it is, my friend.
[02:44:20.189 --> 02:44:20.589]  Wow.
[02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:22.831]  We got a couple extra magazines for you too.
[02:44:23.491 --> 02:44:24.592]  That's a badass gun.
[02:44:24.952 --> 02:44:25.373]  Yeah, it is.
[02:44:25.393 --> 02:44:27.694]  I mean, hands down, these are the best guns.
[02:44:28.455 --> 02:44:28.895]  Very nice.
[02:44:29.215 --> 02:44:29.455]  Was it 9?
[02:44:29.635 --> 02:44:35.439]  Yeah, we'll go out there and we'll shoot like with Glocks at 100 yards, you can't hit the 3-inch target.
[02:44:35.699 --> 02:44:38.761]  With these, bing, bing, bing, bing, 100 yards, man, it's unbelievable.
[02:44:39.162 --> 02:44:46.941]   I am far from a gun expert, but I've recently started acquiring more and more as I think they're important to have.
[02:44:47.101 --> 02:44:48.702]  I think it's important to exercise your rights.
[02:44:48.742 --> 02:44:50.322]  You don't exercise, you lose it.
[02:44:50.342 --> 02:44:51.043]  You know, it atrophies.
[02:44:51.123 --> 02:44:52.163]  Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.
[02:44:52.823 --> 02:44:56.825]  By the way, my other one's at home, my black one, it's the same model.
[02:44:57.325 --> 02:45:00.166]  It's Cernovich's, so we're gonna get that, get that transferred.
[02:45:00.446 --> 02:45:02.247]  But you live in California, so I may not be able to see it.
[02:45:02.267 --> 02:45:03.407]  Well, I can't, I can't get it, yeah.
[02:45:03.447 --> 02:45:04.767]  I just have to covet it from here.
[02:45:05.048 --> 02:45:07.568]  So, California, you can't have anything good.
[02:45:07.588 --> 02:45:09.029]  Why don't we get you to move to Texas?
[02:45:09.849 --> 02:45:11.730]  If I move, I'll move into the Boonies, man.
[02:45:12.683 --> 02:45:15.164]  I'm moving to the boonies.
[02:45:15.224 --> 02:45:16.364]  Wyoming sounds so good.
[02:45:16.704 --> 02:45:17.164]  I don't know.
[02:45:17.584 --> 02:45:19.324]  Man, it sounds like paradise.
[02:45:19.344 --> 02:45:20.565]  Montana, man.
[02:45:20.585 --> 02:45:26.126]  I'm moving to the land of the tatas.
[02:45:26.466 --> 02:45:27.866]  I drove through Wyoming.
[02:45:28.206 --> 02:45:29.547]  There's limited cell service.
[02:45:30.167 --> 02:45:31.347]  Struggled to find a gas station.
[02:45:31.367 --> 02:45:32.387]  Oh, it was beautiful.
[02:45:32.647 --> 02:45:42.669]   You know the guy I want, maybe they can find it, is The, or rather they can find it on the video, is the Sig Sauer has a new bolt action rifle that breaks down that you can carry.
[02:45:42.689 --> 02:45:43.250]  I have that gun.
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:44.310]  Oh my god, we gotta shoot that.
[02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.970]  We'll be shooting it Saturday.
[02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.690]  I want that so bad.
[02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:46.250]  I just got two of them.
[02:45:46.350 --> 02:45:46.810]  Do you really?
[02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:47.950]  Okay, we gotta take that out.
[02:45:47.970 --> 02:45:48.771]  Can I give you that one?
[02:45:48.951 --> 02:45:49.191]  Yes.
[02:45:49.211 --> 02:45:49.931]  Alright.
[02:45:50.051 --> 02:45:52.071]  Yeah, that is... Yeah, it's just badass.
[02:45:52.111 --> 02:45:53.972]  Yeah, yeah, so that's the one with the adjustable stock.
[02:45:53.992 --> 02:45:54.912]  We haven't aired this yet.
[02:45:54.952 --> 02:45:55.752]  Go ask Rob Dewey.
[02:45:55.772 --> 02:45:56.352]  He's got the video.
[02:45:56.372 --> 02:45:57.372]  We haven't aired it from me shooting that.
[02:45:57.692 --> 02:45:58.333]  Badass gun.
[02:45:58.553 --> 02:45:59.333]  Oh my god, beautiful gun.
[02:45:59.353 --> 02:46:00.233]  It's all yours, bounty hunter.
[02:46:00.353 --> 02:46:02.694]  Well, we'll send it to the, you know... Have you seen the Legion?
[02:46:02.754 --> 02:46:03.194]  Absolutely.
[02:46:03.234 --> 02:46:03.674]  Let me see it.
[02:46:03.694 --> 02:46:04.214]  You'll hand it over.
[02:46:04.234 --> 02:46:04.695]  There you go.
[02:46:04.715 --> 02:46:06.235]  Do you have a Sig P320, the Legion?
[02:46:06.255 --> 02:46:07.776]  Uh, that's what I got right there.
[02:46:08.016 --> 02:46:08.336]  Whoa.
[02:46:08.436 --> 02:46:09.316]  Yeah, that's the one.
[02:46:09.356 --> 02:46:10.777]  I've wanted that from, oh my gosh.
[02:46:10.937 --> 02:46:11.637]  It's very light.
[02:46:11.657 --> 02:46:12.737]  We got two of them.
[02:46:12.757 --> 02:46:12.937]  Yeah.
[02:46:13.298 --> 02:46:14.178]  Definitely want to take that out.
[02:46:14.198 --> 02:46:14.838]  We got a few guns.
[02:46:15.018 --> 02:46:16.039]  What do you have it chambered in?
[02:46:17.179 --> 02:46:18.399]  Uh, it's the, uh, Creedmoor.
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:19.360]  Oh, wow.
[02:46:22.481 --> 02:46:22.601]  Good.
[02:46:22.641 --> 02:46:24.001]  I'm gonna have fun with that one then.
[02:46:25.182 --> 02:46:27.403]  Well, this is, this is the deep and heart of Texas.
[02:46:27.443 --> 02:46:28.083]  We got guns.
[02:46:28.897 --> 02:46:31.039]  Yeah, well the constitutional carry here is new.
[02:46:31.419 --> 02:46:32.761]  Yeah, it's wild.
[02:46:32.841 --> 02:46:33.622]  That surprised me.
[02:46:33.642 --> 02:46:35.944]  It's like, I've got my concealed carry card and I'm like, why don't I even have this?
[02:46:36.384 --> 02:46:43.211]  Well, even when I grew up, I grew up in a blue state, but it was still because it was rural guns, so you had all the, you could have almost anything.
[02:46:43.531 --> 02:46:45.993]  Had a lot of fun, but then yeah, California is super strict.
[02:46:46.474 --> 02:46:49.977]  I think the most recent gun you can have is a Gen 3 Glock 19.
[02:46:51.502 --> 02:46:54.483]  And then, first of all, the gun dealers are all jerks down there, too.
[02:46:55.263 --> 02:46:56.903]  I've tweeted about that before, actually.
[02:46:56.923 --> 02:47:05.265]  If anybody's watching and you own a gun shop, and you're jerks to your customers, which is a lot of people who work at gun shops, you're not that cool.
[02:47:05.445 --> 02:47:06.025]  My God!
[02:47:06.205 --> 02:47:07.026]  You're not that cool.
[02:47:07.046 --> 02:47:09.506]  Why do they act like liberal, liberal waiters?
[02:47:09.546 --> 02:47:10.526]  They're jerks.
[02:47:10.546 --> 02:47:12.087]  Yeah, they act like you're imposing.
[02:47:12.107 --> 02:47:12.907]  They're jerks.
[02:47:13.507 --> 02:47:14.147]  It blows me away.
[02:47:14.227 --> 02:47:17.048]  If I have a gun shop, it's like, come to the gun shop, we love you.
[02:47:17.208 --> 02:47:23.151]  I went to one, I was with a guy who's had five deployments, and the gun shop owner talked to us like we were children.
[02:47:23.872 --> 02:47:25.873]  And it's like, what have you even done in your life?
[02:47:26.133 --> 02:47:27.674]  First of all, why are you this condescending?
[02:47:27.834 --> 02:47:29.514]  But you don't even know who you're talking to.
[02:47:29.554 --> 02:47:30.255]  You're dorks.
[02:47:30.355 --> 02:47:31.816]  I've not experienced that.
[02:47:31.856 --> 02:47:33.376]  I've had really, really good experiences.
[02:47:34.357 --> 02:47:36.058]  I will say, though, you mentioned where you grew up.
[02:47:36.398 --> 02:47:38.919]  I grew up in Chicago, where obviously only criminals are allowed to have guns.
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:42.121]  Well, they're not allowed to, but they're the only ones who are capable.
[02:47:42.141 --> 02:47:43.802]  No, they're allowed because they do it, yeah.
[02:47:44.042 --> 02:47:46.664]  Yeah, law-abiding citizens, good luck getting a gun in Illinois.
[02:47:46.704 --> 02:47:48.785]  I mean, you can get long guns, but it's difficult.
[02:47:49.225 --> 02:47:50.987]  It's just... Outside of there, yeah.
[02:47:51.127 --> 02:47:54.149]  I lived in the rural part, so we had... This is during the assault weapons ban.
[02:47:54.169 --> 02:47:55.129]  We had Mac 90s.
[02:47:55.410 --> 02:47:58.652]  You couldn't get them with the pistol grip, but you could get the... Oh, I love my Mac 90.
[02:47:59.052 --> 02:48:02.474]  Yeah, yeah, so you could have... Like, 200 bucks at the gun show, Chinese AK-47.
[02:48:02.674 --> 02:48:05.656]  Yeah, so we have Hungarian... We have one from every country.
[02:48:06.097 --> 02:48:08.738]  So we have... I got a Russian, a Hungarian, and a Chinese one.
[02:48:08.759 --> 02:48:11.400]  Yeah, then you had the milled stock versus the stamped stock.
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:13.822]  Yeah, I got a Sig P226 for my graduation present.
[02:48:14.342 --> 02:48:17.104]  I actually found the stamped one to shoot just as good as the milled one.
[02:48:17.124 --> 02:48:20.426]  Yeah, they do, but the milled one is, because they're so cheap, you would have a bunch.
[02:48:21.106 --> 02:48:30.312]  You would have 10 Mac 90s and think, well, I want one from, we have an Egyptian milled stock, so where the steel almost looks like Damascus, it has the waves in it.
[02:48:30.972 --> 02:48:32.893]  I have all those, but I can't have anything California.
[02:48:33.334 --> 02:48:35.875]  That's all, you know, with my grandpa at his house.
[02:48:36.756 --> 02:48:38.977]  If I miss... The AK-47's a nice, good, simple rifle.
[02:48:40.757 --> 02:48:42.758]  Yeah, they shoot direct blowback.
[02:48:43.418 --> 02:48:44.078]  They're fun.
[02:48:44.098 --> 02:48:49.740]  You know, obviously, because of the long banana-style clip, there's inferior processes to it.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:50.901]  But we had all those.
[02:48:51.341 --> 02:48:56.403]  Yeah, you can have guns that look real in California, but the magazine isn't removable.
[02:48:56.463 --> 02:48:58.063]  It's not even a point to have them.
[02:49:00.464 --> 02:49:05.292]  I actually only ordered a large case of Makarov 9mm because I had no idea.
[02:49:05.312 --> 02:49:07.074]  For those that don't know, it's basically a Soviet bullet.
[02:49:07.095 --> 02:49:08.777]  It doesn't work in a standard 9mm Luger.
[02:49:09.218 --> 02:49:13.625]  And so the guys contacted me from the ammo company and they were like, did you make a mistake on this one?
[02:49:13.725 --> 02:49:15.227]  And I was like, I did, but I want them.
[02:49:15.768 --> 02:49:19.509]  So I ended up getting some Cold War-era Polish handguns.
[02:49:19.689 --> 02:49:20.109]  Nice.
[02:49:20.129 --> 02:49:20.730]  Those are fun.
[02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:21.790]  I think they're called P-64s.
[02:49:21.890 --> 02:49:22.550]  I'm not sure.
[02:49:22.570 --> 02:49:23.090]  Stars?
[02:49:23.570 --> 02:49:24.551]  They're right-handed only.
[02:49:24.591 --> 02:49:26.971]  They have an ergonomic thing that doesn't really go in your left hand.
[02:49:26.991 --> 02:49:27.772]  I got one of those.
[02:49:27.812 --> 02:49:28.892]  But you know what I'm looking for now?
[02:49:28.952 --> 02:49:38.535]  I was talking to someone about maybe we can get a Makarov carbine made so that I have something for the range where I can use these Makarov bullets.
[02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:44.077]  Well, let me tell you, I'm not the super gun guy, like a military guy that knows all the details of an armor.
[02:49:46.181 --> 02:49:47.362]  You're gonna shoot some guns Saturday.
[02:49:47.402 --> 02:49:48.182]  We got some guns.
[02:49:48.202 --> 02:49:49.182]  We got a lot of guns.
[02:49:49.222 --> 02:49:50.443]  I actually got some Barrett M82s.
[02:49:50.463 --> 02:49:53.804]  We got Barretts, we got Lapuas, we got everything.
[02:49:53.844 --> 02:49:54.605]  Do you have a CZ-57?
[02:49:54.785 --> 02:49:57.106]  That's the only gun I have a shot I want to shoot.
[02:49:57.626 --> 02:50:02.648]  The CZ-57 with the weird bullet, the weird, um... Those are really rare.
[02:50:02.668 --> 02:50:04.149]  Yeah, those little bitty guns.
[02:50:04.249 --> 02:50:06.430]  All in law enforcement you get.
[02:50:06.470 --> 02:50:10.251]  CZ-57, they're the ones where the bullet is a different kind of shell casing.
[02:50:10.611 --> 02:50:11.832]  They come out extra fast.
[02:50:11.872 --> 02:50:12.632]  Those are super hard.
[02:50:12.652 --> 02:50:13.132]  Tiny, tiny.
[02:50:13.292 --> 02:50:13.893]  You got any P90s?
[02:50:15.404 --> 02:50:16.384]  We got a lot of guns.
[02:50:17.425 --> 02:50:27.107]  We got, uh... I mean... P90 has the top-loading magazine, where they go in and they spin as they come down into the chamber.
[02:50:27.127 --> 02:50:29.147]  Are you talking about a bulb-up rifle?
[02:50:29.428 --> 02:50:29.848]  Or a pistol?
[02:50:29.868 --> 02:50:31.508]  Uh, no, no, no.
[02:50:31.548 --> 02:50:32.388]  P90s.
[02:50:32.968 --> 02:50:33.929]  You load the mag on top.
[02:50:34.869 --> 02:50:35.329]  Oh, okay.
[02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:36.009]  Then you fold it in.
[02:50:36.029 --> 02:50:37.109]  Yeah, I really want to try one of those.
[02:50:37.129 --> 02:50:37.510]  Is that a SAW?
[02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:38.790]  I don't know.
[02:50:39.570 --> 02:50:40.490]  Yeah, they're just called P90s.
[02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:41.351]  Well, let's see what you got.
[02:50:41.371 --> 02:50:42.911]  Yeah, we got a bulb-up.
[02:50:43.789 --> 02:50:44.569]  We got a lot of guns.
[02:50:44.589 --> 02:50:45.250]  Alright, alright.
[02:50:45.310 --> 02:50:45.790]  Bullpup shotguns.
[02:50:45.810 --> 02:50:46.490]  We have a little too many.
[02:50:46.510 --> 02:50:46.770]  It's fun.
[02:50:46.930 --> 02:50:49.191]  It's like smog sits on piles of gold.
[02:50:49.271 --> 02:50:50.132]  I sit on piles of guns.
[02:50:50.152 --> 02:50:50.812]  No, no, you can't.
[02:50:50.852 --> 02:50:51.312]  No, no.
[02:50:51.592 --> 02:50:56.214]  Sean, when my wife came to meet my dad for the first time, she sees all this stuff.
[02:50:56.234 --> 02:50:57.655]  She's like, oh my god, this is so weird.
[02:50:57.675 --> 02:51:00.376]  And I thought, this is kind of ordinary around where we live.
[02:51:00.636 --> 02:51:02.697]  Like, you only have five MAC-90s.
[02:51:02.717 --> 02:51:03.977]  How can you only have five?
[02:51:04.278 --> 02:51:05.278]  They're only $300 guns.
[02:51:05.338 --> 02:51:09.560]  I don't know what they cost now, but yeah, they were only $300 guns, so you'd go to the gun show.
[02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:16.262]  You get your Mac 90, and then you'd collect the different countries, collect the different... The Mac 90 is the Chinese one, yeah.
[02:51:16.683 --> 02:51:18.743]  Well, it was M-A-K, because you couldn't have an AK-47.
[02:51:18.763 --> 02:51:19.624]  That's what they called it.
[02:51:19.864 --> 02:51:21.004]  So everybody called it Mac 90.
[02:51:21.845 --> 02:51:26.646]  But a Romanian would still be called a Mac 90, even though it wasn't Chinese-made.
[02:51:27.147 --> 02:51:27.487]  All right.
[02:51:28.707 --> 02:51:31.688]  Owen Froyer takes over with the War Room in about three minutes.
[02:51:31.908 --> 02:51:32.869]  We're going to break a minute and a half.
[02:51:33.169 --> 02:51:34.509]  Guys, thank you for coming on.
[02:51:34.529 --> 02:51:37.731]  There's America and the World Survivors Armageddon about to happen.
[02:51:38.471 --> 02:51:38.691]  Both.
[02:51:40.165 --> 02:51:40.365]  Yeah.
[02:51:40.965 --> 02:51:42.286]  Every generation has its struggles.
[02:51:43.026 --> 02:51:59.132]  I think life in the United States is better than it's ever been, but there are very evil elements that are trying to constantly subvert that, so there is a constant battle between two great dragons, or two wolves, or however you want to describe it, and we have to make sure we stand strong, we remain vigilant, otherwise... I agree.
[02:51:59.232 --> 02:52:00.572]  Do you like the tan gun?
[02:52:00.592 --> 02:52:01.092]  You want a black one?
[02:52:01.112 --> 02:52:01.872]  I've got a black one, too.
[02:52:02.093 --> 02:52:02.453]  I like tan.
[02:52:02.493 --> 02:52:02.873]  I like tan.
[02:52:03.053 --> 02:52:03.313]  Good.
[02:52:03.433 --> 02:52:05.714]  It's one of my favorite guns, so enjoy it.
[02:52:05.754 --> 02:52:06.154]  Thank you, sir.
[02:52:06.454 --> 02:52:07.095]  No, thank you.
[02:52:07.115 --> 02:52:09.057]  All right, that's it for this transmission.

[02:52:44.873 --> 02:52:45.373]  I am back.
[02:52:45.413 --> 02:52:46.134]  I committed to that.
[02:52:46.555 --> 02:52:47.155]  Yes!
[02:52:48.677 --> 02:52:50.159]  And I'm gonna make Tim Pool come over here, too.
[02:52:50.459 --> 02:52:52.021]  All right, that's it for this transmission.
[02:52:52.061 --> 02:52:52.481]  Love you all.
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:53:07.101]  Great job, Drew.
[02:53:07.734 --> 02:53:10.875]  You know it's a hurricane, you know it's got a lot of water it's going to dump, it's going to cause flooding.
[02:53:11.315 --> 02:53:22.698]  So it wasn't a prediction 20 months ago when I said the UN order to lock down the world economy is going to cause a chain reaction that's going to cause supply chain problems for years and it's going to starve tens of millions to death.
[02:53:23.118 --> 02:53:23.959]  And now it all happened.
[02:53:23.979 --> 02:53:30.044]  25 million extra dead, hundreds of millions on the verge of starvation, and the UN that ordered it is running around being the savior.
[02:53:30.865 --> 02:53:33.467]  Listen, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:53:33.607 --> 02:53:35.428]  And now the first world is becoming the third world.
[02:53:35.508 --> 02:53:36.910]  So, listen to me now.

[02:53:45.957 --> 02:53:47.979]  We cannot suppress prices anymore.
[02:53:48.439 --> 02:53:55.660]  So protect yourself, get high quality storable food, so you're self-sufficient, and fund the InfoWars today at 360Win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:53:55.861 --> 02:53:56.861]  It's time to get your food.
[02:53:58.321 --> 02:54:02.242]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:54:02.942 --> 02:54:04.642]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:04.962 --> 02:54:08.463]  This is the War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[02:54:08.503 --> 02:54:12.804]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:54:14.949 --> 02:54:18.331]  You know, I hear you, Alex, talking about InfoWarsStore.com, right?
[02:54:18.731 --> 02:54:24.714]  It is so important that people buy from your store and from other, you know, small businesses.
[02:54:25.275 --> 02:54:26.335]  That is so critical.
[02:54:26.375 --> 02:54:28.236]  And it might not sound like a big deal.
[02:54:28.536 --> 02:54:29.777]  It's a very big deal.
[02:54:29.817 --> 02:54:35.300]  When you look at these tech companies like Amazon and what they are doing in the marketplace, we have empowered them.
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:37.141]  And this is actually sickens me a little bit.
[02:54:37.601 --> 02:54:46.628]  That we empower these giant tech corporations by giving them our money, and then they turn around and bludgeon our lives, rob our children of their futures.
[02:54:46.968 --> 02:54:50.231]  You know that I've been a homeschooling parent my entire life, right?
[02:54:50.271 --> 02:54:53.533]  I have five kids, my oldest is 21, but I homeschooled them their whole lives.
[02:54:53.713 --> 02:54:55.995]  Had nothing to do with COVID, obviously, it was long before that.
[02:54:56.295 --> 02:54:57.575]  I've been telling people for a long time.
[02:54:57.615 --> 02:54:58.536]  The system's corrupt.
[02:54:58.556 --> 02:54:59.576]  Get your kids out of it, right?
[02:54:59.976 --> 02:55:09.820]  And so then we watch these big companies that we pump money into just destroy our families and destroy everything around us and we keep giving them our money and that's crazy to me.
[02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:18.382]  So another way that you can, if you want to do something, is stop and opt out of these systems that fund and finance the very people who hate you.
[02:55:18.743 --> 02:55:20.663]  Stop giving money to people who hate you.
[02:55:20.783 --> 02:55:27.905]   By the way, what you're saying is Beyond revolutionary, it's the key to how we save our civilization and save ourselves.
[02:55:27.925 --> 02:55:32.466]  We have to build our own infrastructure, our own networks, and communications is first and foremost.
[02:55:32.806 --> 02:55:40.647]  That's why Lister's supporting what you're doing, supporting what we're doing, just spreading the word, just praying for us, but also buying the products, supporting the sponsors.
[02:55:41.007 --> 02:55:41.787]  This is a war.
[02:55:41.786 --> 02:55:45.786]   That's what they're trying to not just de-platform us, but de-bank us and take our credit cards away
[02:55:45.786 --> 02:55:50.026]   because they understand they've got to silence focal points like Infowars and like what you're
[02:55:50.026 --> 02:55:51.786]  doing with sovereign media.
[02:55:51.786 --> 02:56:04.266]   Introducing 50percentoff.com, an exclusive new outlet with survival, preparedness,

[02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:25.681]  He runs a lot of other big sites.
[02:56:26.101 --> 02:56:33.365]  He heard me on air a few months ago talking about the fact that we have trouble having enough capital to buy enough product into the future.
[02:56:33.726 --> 02:56:37.368]  And so we run out of things, especially with the supply chain breakdowns.
[02:56:37.388 --> 02:56:39.029]  He said, listen, I'll go in.
[02:56:39.469 --> 02:56:41.551]  I'll give you the money to buy extra product.
[02:56:42.111 --> 02:56:43.672]  Then you simply supply it to us.
