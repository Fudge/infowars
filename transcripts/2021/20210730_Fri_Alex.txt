[00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:42.426]  Twilight of freedom and a human world itself.
[00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.208]  Twilight of our Republic.
[00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.609]  Twilight of our families.
[00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.673]  The twilight of every check and balance of due process that has made us happy and wealthy and free.
[00:00:54.673 --> 00:01:03.958]  We have traded our birthright, just like we see in the biblical story of Cain and Abel, for nothing.
[00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:04.638]  We've thrown it away.
[00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:07.399]  And now we're going into great bondage.
[00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:20.705]  And I know many of you have been good, hard-working people, and you've been Christian, you love God, and you're the reason this country's under attack, because once they've extinguished you, once you've extinguished the light of God that shines out of you, no matter what color you are, you have that spirit.
[00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:28.088]  The enemy hates you because we have that kinship that brings us together, despite our skin color or where we came from.
[00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:35.212]  If the enemy is able to extinguish enough of that light, they know they're going to be able to take over the entire planet, and that's where we are evil,
[00:01:36.747 --> 00:01:37.628]  It's now out in the open.
[00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:45.033]  That's why everything it says and everything it does is an easily verifiable lie, because it's a spiritual choice.
[00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.054]  People choose to believe the lie.
[00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.976]  They choose to buy into the fraud.
[00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.798]  They choose to bow down to it.
[00:01:52.798 --> 00:02:04.685]  Adam Salazar wrote an article that is the most important COVID story of this entire globalist takeover in the last year and a half.
[00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:05.466]  He wrote it last night.
[00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:16.040]  And I'm not mad at anybody, but I've sent it around to key people I know and other folks, and they don't even care.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.662]  If it's some little side issue, boy, everybody just jumps right on it.
[00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:19.242]  It's so important.
[00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:31.731]  But when it's the holy grail of truth, when it's the total proof that will overturn the lies hiding in plain view, well then, the story goes nowhere.
[00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:32.692]  So, if the story
[00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:37.714]  Is to go anywhere, and it's been reposted to the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:38.514]  I don't want the credit.
[00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:38.955]  I don't care.
[00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:41.156]  Everybody else should take the article.
[00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:41.976]  But Don doesn't care.
[00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.377]  You should rewrite it.
[00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:45.398]  I don't care if it's Breitbart.
[00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.380]  I don't care if it's all these other talk show hosts.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.501]  I don't care if it's Bongino.
[00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.923]  I don't care who it is.
[00:02:51.923 --> 00:02:56.125]  But it's the holy grail of truth that will overturn all these lies.
[00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:00.668]  And I'm just asking listeners, respectfully, if you care about your freedom, if you care about the future,
[00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.067]  To get the article.
[00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:07.110]  I'm going to turn this over to Owen for the rest of the segment so he can tell you what he has coming up.
[00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.295]  I have a big announcement concerning censorship and free speech and Mike Lindell and Fox News.
[00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:16.278]  You've seen that he's pulled his advertising from Fox News.
[00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:18.680]  Well, I'll be giving you the rest of the story of that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.905]  We've got these gigantic developments, but I've learned that if I just throw out a giant article right up front, nobody cares.
[00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.026]  What if I build it up for a few days?
[00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:27.087]  I'm going to do Crimson Contagion.
[00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:42.966]  We had 3 million extra people tuned in that day and it actually changed the world and got to foreign leaders and got to former US intelligence heads and, you know, really has had a big effect with what's left of our military, the good faction to fully understand the takeover.
[00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.127]  But I told you they're going to declare unvaccinated terrorists.
[00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:50.509]  That's in the new National Terrorism Directive of June that Biden signed.
[00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:51.569]  I don't just say this stuff.
[00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.210]  It sounds shocking.
[00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.111]  When I say they want to kill you and your family, that's their goal.
[00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.811]  That's Bill Gates.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.920]  The globalist goal.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.601]  So, Owen, tell folks what else you've got coming up.
[00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:09.903]  When we come back, I'm going to go over a lot of this on Salazar's article that's on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:13.924]  We're also posting it to the live show feed page.
[00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:18.006]  And it's a planetary global bombshell.
[00:04:18.006 --> 00:04:25.648]  There are more than 30 countries, we just wrote five of them in the article, that have the highest vaccination rates on the planet for COVID-19.
[00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.834]  And many of them are islands, so they've been locked down for over a year and a half.
[00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.715]  They have the highest death rates and the highest COVID rates.
[00:04:33.715 --> 00:04:37.436]  But it's not COVID, it's spike protein that's colonized your body.
[00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:38.496]  Talk about an alien takeover.
[00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:40.636]  Bill Gates is pure evil.
[00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:47.658]  And so, that has now come out, ladies and gentlemen, that it's the places with the highest vaccine rates and the highest deaths.
[00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:49.599]  We already knew that, but this is totally confirmed.
[00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.020]  It's Gibraltar and Iceland in Singapore and other areas.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.200]  I want to tell folks what you've got coming up.
[00:04:55.695 --> 00:05:00.638]  I will tell you what we have coming up right after this short break.
[00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:06.741]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:14.225]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:16.546]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:20.128]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:30.216]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:36.121]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:46.190]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.

[00:05:57.596 --> 00:05:58.797]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:18.967]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:20.648]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:22.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:28.711]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:32.393]  And ladies and gentlemen, as we're live on this Friday, July 30th, 2021, I thank God
[00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:52.746]  For giving us this opportunity, not just staying live on air despite all the attacks against us, but just to have breath in my lungs, and vision in my eyes, and sounds in my ears, just to be able to live in this consciousness, and to be able to face the test that we are enduring right now.
[00:06:54.195 --> 00:07:06.863]  And that we can be good enough to live up to God's expectations for us and that we don't have to live in a satanic hellhole that is being built for us right now by the establishment.
[00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:09.585]  Owen Troyer in studio, Alex Jones on the line.
[00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:12.727]  We've got all kinds of big COVID updates here.
[00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:21.114]  I've got Republicans, some Republicans, finally pushing back, finally getting a backbone, finally getting some fight in them.
[00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:26.339]  And then we'll have some statements from Republicans as well showing that is the case.
[00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.802]  But as Alex was just explaining in the opening segment,
[00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:33.575]  The big vaccine push is still on.
[00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:47.961]  They're only going to clamp down harder and more with every passing day, despite the fact that the most vaccinated nations in the world, like Israel and like Iceland, are having the biggest outbreaks of COVID.
[00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:55.604]  That's because, just as the doctor guest we had on said, the vaccinated people would be causing the mutations of a more deadlier virus.
[00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:59.366]  And Alex, we are now in that timeframe.
[00:07:59.366 --> 00:07:59.986]  Absolutely.
[00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:08.401]  Oh, and this story, this story that's on InfoWars.com by Don Salazar, it's into this.
[00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:10.522]  And this is the big issue that we've got to hammer.
[00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:15.145]  They're now saying unvaccinated are terrorists, that we shouldn't have food, shouldn't have our children.
[00:08:15.743 --> 00:08:18.104]  Should be able to leave our homes, we should be put in camps.
[00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:19.385]  So it's no longer speculation.
[00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:31.873]  As I told you years ago, global government would use the fear of a virus to bring in a digital world currency and then lock up people that didn't take the poison shots, that the poison shots can reduce your fertility and kill you very slowly with a soft kill weapon.
[00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:33.454]  That's how they get away with it.
[00:08:33.454 --> 00:08:35.515]  And of course, it's a side effect when it kills you quickly.
[00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:43.360]  They don't like that, but it seems to be so strong that it has already killed conservatively over a million people worldwide from the deadly shots.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.400]  But the real death comes later.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.301]  So here's the huge story.
[00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:51.760]  But I know as the listeners, you're already up to speed, you're already informed, you already know this, but the general public doesn't understand this.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.346]  They hear Fauci and they see these other liars on TV saying this lie.
[00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:02.629]  99% of people dying have not taken a COVID shot.
[00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.952]  And notice, now even Congress said, give us those statistics.
[00:09:04.952 --> 00:09:06.052]  That was a week ago.
[00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:07.113]  They won't do it.
[00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:10.116]  It does not exist.
[00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.037]  It's off Cook numbers.
[00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:19.908]  Where they counted from the beginning of the fake pandemic, in January of last year, into January of this year, when the inoculations began.
[00:09:19.908 --> 00:09:27.695]  And for the first month, they did not ask someone who had been inoculated, who was sick at the hospital, to do a COVID test, because that was, quote, the CDC directive.
[00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:28.796]  That's how they took statistics.
[00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:35.102]  So, they did not put any deaths from anyone else in the database to then create that fraudulent number.
[00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:36.663]  That's now confirmed.
[00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:37.584]  Congress knows that.
[00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:38.685]  Everything these criminals say,
[00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:40.677]  Here's a lie.
[00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:44.339]  Now, let's talk about the big giant elephant in the room and the total proof.
[00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:53.582]  There's an article on Infowars.com, and again, there's more than 40 countries, but there's about 22 that are really the most important.
[00:09:53.582 --> 00:09:59.605]  Island nations, you name it, but all of them are very isolated, very authoritarian, very controlled areas.
[00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:05.107]  Singapore, Iceland, Israel, but many of them are physical islands
[00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:07.039]  We're good to go.
[00:10:34.338 --> 00:10:42.424]  With the top numbers of people sick, the top numbers of people dying, and they're calling it the Delta variant, which is really prions, protein spike crystals.
[00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:45.666]  They are all the countries with the most death, with the most sick people.
[00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:48.528]  And we said this, the vaccine is what will kill you.
[00:10:48.528 --> 00:10:52.791]  And then they will say that it is the unvaccinated coming up in the fall.
[00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:53.652]  I said this a year ago.
[00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:58.155]  I said next fall, they will put the lockdown back in.
[00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.716]  Predicted it all because I didn't predict it.
[00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:00.997]  It was in government documents.
[00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:02.218]  It was in Canadian documents.
[00:11:02.218 --> 00:11:03.259]  It was in UN documents.
[00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:08.224]  A year and a half ago, that Canadian document came out, or almost a year and a half ago.
[00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:09.586]  People said, is it real?
[00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:10.947]  And they all went over it.
[00:11:10.947 --> 00:11:17.214]  I said, well, we'll have to wait for the dates of the lockdown 2 and 3 and all the rest of it, because Canada was never going to come out of lockdown.
[00:11:17.214 --> 00:11:19.917]  I said, let's just search in parts of the document.
[00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:22.781]  So I sat there in Rob's office for about two hours a year ago.
[00:11:23.672 --> 00:11:36.581]  And we just simply took pieces out of the document and searched them and found out that it was all a UN document that the Canadians had just added a few paragraphs to for their country and to their provincial systems and citing their laws.
[00:11:36.581 --> 00:11:51.251]  And so again, folks, there's a big article by Paul Watson about Chris Sky, who I think is a great guy, I'm going to get him back on the show, but he's like, everyone thinks Chris Sky is psychic now, and there's tens of millions of views of him a year ago predicting precisely what happened.
[00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:54.748]  And again, I'd love to say I'm psyching you, I'd love to say Chris Sky's psyching you.
[00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:56.489]  No, we have the battle plan.
[00:11:56.489 --> 00:12:09.018]  But what's frustrating is when you go to the tweet that Paul Watson's linked to, with one version of the video that has 1.7 million views on Twitter, half the commenters are, no, it's you, Chris Sky, and Alex Jones that are to blame.
[00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:10.659]  You told people not to take the shots.
[00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:12.981]  You told people not to lock down.
[00:12:12.981 --> 00:12:14.962]  And so now, it's your fault.
[00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:21.770]  That all of this happened and we need to go back on lockdown now to finally end the virus and finally open things up.
[00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:28.813]  So these people are in delusion and or they're being paid as we know millions of people have been paid as influencers, millions.
[00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:33.995]  And even people that have like a thousand followers it turns out are paid like five thousand dollars to put out BS.
[00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:39.877]  And so they're all they're piling on saying no no no it's your fault it's your fault but we have the evidence that it's the vaccinated that are sick and dying.
[00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:42.530]  We have the evidence that the vaccine's poisonous.
[00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.110]  It doesn't work.
[00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.511]  We have their admissions.
[00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:45.072]  We have them.
[00:12:45.072 --> 00:12:48.413]  So now everybody's got to push really hard.
[00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:49.354]  Go out and demonstrate.
[00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:50.655]  Go out and protest.
[00:12:50.655 --> 00:12:51.575]  Call on the talk radio.
[00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:52.376]  Call on the C-SPAN.
[00:12:52.376 --> 00:12:53.536]  Call Congress.
[00:12:53.536 --> 00:12:58.399]  Because if they get the new lockdown in, then it never goes off again, okay?
[00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.720]  And they're bringing in the Cashless Society.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.760]  They're bringing in the contact tracers.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.922]  They're bringing in the digital tracker systems.
[00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:06.624]  This is the holy grail for their World ID and their carbon taxes.
[00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:07.064]  So please,
[00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:24.012]  Everyone needs to write more articles in and around what Adan has written, explaining Israel, explaining Singapore, explaining Iceland, explaining Gibraltar, explaining all these other places where they have the highest vaccinated, they have the highest number of sick and dying, and it's people that were vaccinated.
[00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:28.414]  Everything Fauci says is a criminal lie, and we can literally call for his arrest.
[00:13:28.414 --> 00:13:29.414]  Here's the deal.
[00:13:29.414 --> 00:13:30.994]  They're going to blame somebody for this.
[00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:32.855]  They're going to try to blame the Chinese.
[00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:36.896]  What I've explained is the Chinese are just globalist clients who are in on this, the Communist Party.
[00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:47.112]  But it is the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it is Bill Gates and Ted Turner and George Soros that run this whole damn thing on record.
[00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:50.394]  I told you guys at the start a year and a half ago the Rockefeller Foundation is running this.
[00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:51.975]  I didn't just pull that out of my rear end.
[00:13:51.975 --> 00:13:54.977]  Now you notice the Rockefeller is in full command of the U.S.
[00:13:54.977 --> 00:13:55.517]  and the U.N.
[00:13:55.517 --> 00:13:56.277]  global response.
[00:13:56.277 --> 00:13:59.699]  Gates has been removed because he was always their front man.
[00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:00.140]  You understand?
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.181]  We have to explain that we're under U.N.
[00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:12.804]  Rockefeller Foundation control, but so Rockefeller created the United Nations in 1946, they financed the whole damn thing with British Empire money, and we're here.
[00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:27.388]  And so this thing is a fraud, a proven fraud, and they are murdering people with this deadly shot, and they are murdering the truth, they're murdering our freedom, and murdering our future, and new lockdowns already announced in Africa, and Asia, and India, already causing tens of millions more to starve to death, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:28.969]  Then they turn around and say COVID killed them.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.224]  So this is a master plan, world genocide, bigger than Hitler right now.
[00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:36.525]  This has already killed more people than Hitler did.
[00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:40.028]  We are literally facing Hitler on PCP and steroids.
[00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:44.751]  We are literally facing a psychotic mass murder operation in the open.
[00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:49.995]  And I know this sounds shocking, but if you don't fully understand this and fully get this, it's over.
[00:14:49.995 --> 00:14:52.337]  I call on whistleblowers inside the Justice Department.
[00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:56.040]  I call on whistleblowers inside Google and big tech and all of it, you know.
[00:14:57.068 --> 00:14:57.969]  This is mass murder now.
[00:14:57.969 --> 00:14:58.910]  You know we're right now.
[00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.931]  You've got the documents.
[00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:00.691]  You've got the proof.
[00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.833]  Do you guys want to be part of this?
[00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:07.217]  We need everyone to either strike, or we need everyone to whistleblow.
[00:15:07.217 --> 00:15:13.503]  Do whatever you got, because they're assaulting us physically right now, and they want us to get violent so they can call us terrorists.
[00:15:13.503 --> 00:15:18.988]  I don't want to get violent, but I want to go right maximum civil disobedience now.
[00:15:18.988 --> 00:15:21.610]  We have to move against these people now or it's over.
[00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.411]  And for all you out there,
[00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:24.548]  They're delusional.
[00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.969]  And think you're going to sit on the fence and ride this through and you're going to be safe that way.
[00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.190]  You're fools.
[00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.931]  We got to this position because the people have that attitude.
[00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:32.872]  It's time to pick a side.
[00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:34.953]  You pick Satan or you pick Jesus.
[00:15:34.953 --> 00:15:36.533]  And it's really that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:39.215]  No one will escape this system.
[00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:51.601]  All these fools, you know, like the Rockefeller grandson told Aaron Russo before he died about how we're going to have a global government, a chip under our skin to control us and the elites will be able to travel.
[00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:52.241]  Nobody else will.
[00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:56.602]  Those so-called elites are the most deceived ones there are.
[00:15:56.602 --> 00:15:59.724]  So I'm going to come back and lay all this out and so much more in a big announcement.
[00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:05.869]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:13.355]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:15.657]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:19.160]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:29.330]  This historical event will be live-streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:35.237]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:16:35.237 --> 00:16:42.385]  To help support this Cyber Symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products.
[00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:43.406]  We're good to go.
[00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:01.142]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[00:17:01.142 --> 00:17:01.903]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:02.643]  Trying to move quicker.
[00:17:02.643 --> 00:17:03.463]  Hey, Alex.
[00:17:03.463 --> 00:17:03.923]  Welcome.
[00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:09.064]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[00:17:09.064 --> 00:17:12.445]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[00:17:12.445 --> 00:17:18.906]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:20.567]  Living Defense saved my life.
[00:17:20.567 --> 00:17:24.728]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[00:17:24.728 --> 00:17:26.168]  Living Defense brought me back.
[00:17:26.448 --> 00:17:31.970]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.770]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.831]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:59.683]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:03.046]  But I'll tell you who's got five-star ratings when it comes to customer service.
[00:18:03.046 --> 00:18:14.515]  I'll tell you who built his network and infrastructure and has thousands of employees here in the United States and sources materials all over North America and from Africa as well, which he's proud of.
[00:18:14.515 --> 00:18:18.398]  That's where you get the good cotton and then they put it together here in the United States.
[00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:18.938]  And that is
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.381]  Mike Lindell.
[00:18:21.381 --> 00:18:22.822]  Mike Lindell is a patriot.
[00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:24.524]  Mike Lindell is fighting.
[00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:25.744]  He is bold.
[00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:30.168]  And he's got his products in stock, ready to ship to you.

[00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:50.024]  And he's done great.
[00:18:50.024 --> 00:18:50.745]  His people are great.
[00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:53.747]  They've really come through and taken us out of the red into the black.
[00:18:53.747 --> 00:19:02.114]  So thank you all for shopping at MyPillow.com, up to 66% off with promo code ALEX.
[00:19:02.114 --> 00:19:04.757]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:22.400]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.000]  Ten miles.
[00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:48.789]  And miles and miles and miles.
[00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:52.750]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.591]  I am via the phone.
[00:19:53.591 --> 00:19:56.992]  I'll be back in Austin, Texas this evening.
[00:19:56.992 --> 00:19:59.292]  Really appreciate Owen Schroeder and the crew doing a great job.
[00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:03.934]  Appreciate the listeners that are tuned in as well.
[00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:10.735]  And we've got some big free speech news for you coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:12.576]  But Owen, again,
[00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:21.039]  We've been successful because I study geopolitical systems, I study the globalist own writings, I read the books these guys put out.
[00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:36.151]  They think we're so stupid they brag to each other, as you know, in their different books like Tragedy and Hope, written back in their late 1960s, Bill Clinton's top mentor, the head of political science at Georgetown University, Carol Quigley, or Zebrinsky's books, written in the 70s, 80s, and 90s and 2000s.
[00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:42.140]  Where he says, we just need to go ahead and kill the majority of the world population for the Earth.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.221]  These people are worthless.
[00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:44.662]  They have no real lives.
[00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:46.223]  I mean, these people are out in the open.
[00:20:46.223 --> 00:20:48.284]  Jane Goodall, all of them.
[00:20:48.284 --> 00:20:51.886]  All the big top, you know, environmental spokespersons.
[00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:54.908]  And it's a perfect way for them to play God and then rule over us.
[00:20:54.908 --> 00:21:00.852]  And look, they've got some points about toxic waste and people and all the rest of it, but they don't care about people.
[00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:02.794]  They don't care about the Earth.
[00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.515]  Which is an excuse for their power grab.
[00:21:05.023 --> 00:21:10.244]  And people better get their minds wrapped around this, or they deserve what happens to them.
[00:21:10.244 --> 00:21:10.924]  But here's the deal.
[00:21:10.924 --> 00:21:12.665]  I don't deserve to be forcibly inoculated.
[00:21:12.665 --> 00:21:13.565]  My children don't.
[00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.365]  And I don't deserve to be starved to death.
[00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:18.146]  And I don't give the globalists the right to do that to me.
[00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:24.988]  So if they're assaulting me, and they carry out these criminal actions against me, I have a right and a duty to defend myself by any means necessary.
[00:21:24.988 --> 00:21:29.029]  But I know they've got it set up that if we were to be violent, it would turn them into martyrs.
[00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.869]  The last thing I want
[00:21:30.751 --> 00:21:32.172]  I want these people to be martyrs.
[00:21:32.172 --> 00:21:35.274]  I want to politically, culturally destroy them.
[00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:36.896]  I want them to be the villains they are.
[00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:39.358]  I want folks to know who Bill Gates is.
[00:21:39.358 --> 00:21:41.699]  I want them to know who the Rockefeller Foundation is.
[00:21:41.699 --> 00:21:44.081]  I want them to know who Joe Biden is.
[00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:49.545]  You know, when he sits up there walking up to the press, literally degenerating in front of them, saying, I just got my ass wiped.
[00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:52.968]  So, but we have to physically not comply.
[00:21:52.968 --> 00:21:59.573]  We have to physically not use their smartphones, physically not take their digital IDs, physically not submit, because the Holy Grail for them
[00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:06.251]  Is the worldwide ID, that the medical ID, vaccine passport, forms the basis of it?
[00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:10.633]  Again, this is all from the UK government, all from the EU, all from Biden.
[00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:17.297]  In fact, I have a clip we'll play here in just a moment where he was on TV last night at the press conference, the puppet President Biden.
[00:22:17.297 --> 00:22:19.298]  It's clip five, get it ready.
[00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:24.200]  And Biden admits that, yes, I want a mandate that's forcing you to take it.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.402]  Oh, but they don't call it forced medical tyranny.
[00:22:26.402 --> 00:22:26.922]  They don't call it
[00:22:27.663 --> 00:22:29.604]  Uh, Nuremberg code violation.
[00:22:29.604 --> 00:22:32.306]  Uh, they don't say, oh, we're giving you an experimental shot whether you like it or not.
[00:22:32.306 --> 00:22:36.368]  They don't say, hey, we've taken the mirror site down because it shows all the deaths.
[00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:38.889]  They don't say, hey, this vaccine's banned in most parts of the world.
[00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:41.471]  They don't say, oh, hey, look, it totally failed.
[00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:44.753]  The majority of those sick and dying have taken the shot, which is all admitted.
[00:22:44.753 --> 00:22:50.396]  They don't say, oh, countries with 99%, 98% inoculation rate have the highest rates.
[00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:52.637]  No, they just say, you're crazy.
[00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:53.218]  You're bad.
[00:22:53.218 --> 00:22:54.738]  And he hops around in a $10,000 suit.
[00:22:56.585 --> 00:23:00.149]  Wearing aviator glasses, talking about getting his butt wiped.
[00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.649]  And you know what?
[00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:04.112]  That's our fault that we let these demons do this to us.
[00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:06.715]  Well, now they know we're coming for them.
[00:23:06.715 --> 00:23:10.058]  Now they know we've gotten all these laws passed, but they can't steal elections as easy.
[00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:11.560]  So what are they doing?
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.523]  They're trying to gut the country, gut the dollar, destroy our name everywhere.
[00:23:14.523 --> 00:23:18.506]  They're trying to run us into the ground as fast as they can, because this is war.
[00:23:18.506 --> 00:23:20.989]  But instead of us getting demoralized, instead of us
[00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:22.274]  Thinking we've lost.
[00:23:22.274 --> 00:23:22.934]  It's the opposite.
[00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:23.695]  They're going to lose.
[00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:25.917]  They've done this out of desperation.
[00:23:25.917 --> 00:23:28.379]  And again, they're behavioral psychologists.
[00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:36.966]  That's why all of this is done by very sick, mentally ill, satanic behavioral psychologists who are trying to project their own mental illness onto us and gaslight us.
[00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:41.290]  But if you just reject everything they say and everything they do, then they can do nothing.
[00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.672]  They're trying to put us into an alternate reality.
[00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:46.614]  That's why they tell us that we live in an alternate reality.
[00:23:46.614 --> 00:23:48.256]  Yeah, I do live in the real reality where I
[00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.970]  Read their actual policy reports and what they're actually planning.
[00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:57.331]  Not what they say they're going to do, but what they actually say in their battle plans.
[00:23:57.331 --> 00:24:04.993]  So here is the puppet in chief, the pretender in chief, the reanimated corpse, saying that yes, he wants mandates.
[00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:06.754]  He's just seeing if it's legal.
[00:24:06.754 --> 00:24:08.214]  No, it's not legal under U.S.
[00:24:08.214 --> 00:24:08.894]  law.
[00:24:08.894 --> 00:24:10.015]  Not legal under local law.
[00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:12.735]  I don't care what the corrupt Justice Department says.
[00:24:12.735 --> 00:24:17.357]  That same Justice Department says states can't do audits, and they better stop the audits.
[00:24:17.357 --> 00:24:18.537]  They just came out yesterday with
[00:24:19.199 --> 00:24:19.979]  We're good to go.
[00:24:38.928 --> 00:24:44.634]  They want to get us all on universal income so they can blame us for the collapse and make us buy into that next level of the system.
[00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:46.836]  It's all coming to a head.
[00:24:46.836 --> 00:24:48.517]  How would the UN take over?
[00:24:48.517 --> 00:24:49.959]  How would the Fortune 100 take over?
[00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:50.780]  Look at Google.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.600]  Look at Microsoft.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.761]  Look at Facebook.
[00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:54.443]  Look at Amazon.
[00:24:54.443 --> 00:24:58.447]  They've all, what, doubled profits this year already.
[00:24:58.447 --> 00:25:00.669]  They doubled and tripled profits last year.
[00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:03.572]  And the new lockdowns are here to squeeze you again.
[00:25:04.065 --> 00:25:07.149]  And this time, none of the businesses will reopen except for them.
[00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:11.995]  This is a criminal takeover, that's why they're doing it, on every damn front.
[00:25:11.995 --> 00:25:14.658]  So, will we take it or will we fight back?
[00:25:14.658 --> 00:25:16.000]  Here is the Puppet In Chief.
[00:25:17.748 --> 00:25:18.649]  Yes.
[00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:20.110]  Mr. President, thank you.
[00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:25.453]  Why not push for vaccine mandates in states, private companies, schools?
[00:25:25.453 --> 00:25:29.576]  Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?
[00:25:29.576 --> 00:25:32.718]  Well, I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction.
[00:25:32.718 --> 00:25:35.500]  And that's why I pointed out.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:40.504]  I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is they're able to do that legally.
[00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:41.945]  And they can.
[00:25:41.945 --> 00:25:43.566]  Local communities can do that.
[00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:45.047]  Local businesses can do that.
[00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:49.732]  It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country.
[00:25:49.732 --> 00:25:54.553]  I don't know that yet.
[00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.214]  So, he's trying to make it sound like he's reasonable.
[00:25:57.214 --> 00:26:10.537]  Uh, yeah, under the eugenics laws passed in 1907, 1918, starting with Margaret Sanger in New York and the Rockefeller Foundation, same people, look it up, they were saying they were allowed to take a woman just because she didn't make good grades in school and cut her uterus out.
[00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:14.761]  They were allowed to actually kill people in some cases.
[00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:19.364]  So, I mean, I guess they're saying they've got laws saying that they can kill us.
[00:26:19.364 --> 00:26:20.724]  Again, I'm riding shotgun with Owen Schroer.
[00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:25.267]  I'm going to come back with some important First Amendment announcements, a bunch of other news.
[00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:29.409]  And then, Owen, you've got a lot coming up in the second and third hour today.
[00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:30.150]  Tell us what's coming up then.
[00:26:31.718 --> 00:26:38.843]  Well, and let me just say in response to the clip we just played of Biden, Alex, you know that this is a very measured statement from Biden.
[00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:42.285]  They would do the federal mandates tomorrow if they thought they could get away with it.
[00:26:42.285 --> 00:26:57.175]  They know that it's a direct violation of the Nuremberg Code and so they want to put that pressure on, as he said, local governments and local businesses so that they bear the burden when all these people are dying of the vaccines and it doesn't come back to Biden's doorstep.
[00:26:57.175 --> 00:26:58.797]  So if they do make that leap,
[00:26:59.457 --> 00:27:03.480]  To make it a federal mandate, that means it's no holds barred.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:11.065]  They've withdrawn any semblance of trying to pretend like they care about you, and they're just going to go full bore with it.
[00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:14.307]  But again, Republicans are finally standing up to this.
[00:27:14.307 --> 00:27:21.452]  I've got some statements from Republicans like Ted Cruz and Andy Biggs and others that say, OK, we're going to stand up, we're going to fight against this.
[00:27:21.452 --> 00:27:25.254]  But you know, here's what's so frustrating, Alex, and I'm seeing this a lot, I'm sure you are too.
[00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:32.702]  Whether it's commentators or talk show hosts or members of Congress or whatever saying, none of this makes sense to me.
[00:27:32.702 --> 00:27:33.343]  I don't get it.
[00:27:33.343 --> 00:27:34.825]  They keep flip-flopping.
[00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:35.525]  This doesn't make sense.
[00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:36.667]  This doesn't make sense.
[00:27:36.667 --> 00:27:43.694]  No, see, it does make sense as soon as you accept the fact that this is an agenda to enslave the planet.
[00:27:44.395 --> 00:27:45.496]  Then it makes sense.
[00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:53.943]  If you think that these people care about you, if you think Fauci and Garland and Biden and all these corrupt politicians care about you, then yeah, none of this makes sense.
[00:27:53.943 --> 00:27:58.147]  But as soon as you accept the fact that this is an agenda to enslave you, then you get it.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:07.326]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[00:28:07.326 --> 00:28:10.890]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.413]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[00:28:14.413 --> 00:28:20.018]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:28:20.018 --> 00:28:20.859]  Well guess what?
[00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:24.862]  It was Anthony Fauci and eugenicists globalists that
[00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:40.836]  Ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:28:41.556 --> 00:28:47.903]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:28:47.903 --> 00:28:51.227]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine.
[00:28:51.227 --> 00:28:57.213]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:28:57.213 --> 00:28:58.335]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:06.093]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:29:06.093 --> 00:29:13.595]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:29:13.595 --> 00:29:15.915]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:19.396]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:29:21.397 --> 00:29:29.583]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:35.487]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:29:35.487 --> 00:29:45.613]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.

[00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:58.243]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:29:59.858 --> 00:30:08.021]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:16.804]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[00:30:16.804 --> 00:30:18.745]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[00:30:19.125 --> 00:30:23.709]  In a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:23.709 --> 00:30:26.371]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[00:30:26.371 --> 00:30:32.395]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones, and 50% off $14.95.
[00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:35.698]  They sell these babies for $29.95 all day long.
[00:30:35.698 --> 00:30:48.608]  We've got a private label with InfoWars on them for $14.95, because I want you to get them, and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones really are.
[00:30:49.068 --> 00:30:56.951]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:02.953]  They're 50% off right now at mfulmorestore.com.
[00:31:02.953 --> 00:31:05.593]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:30.348]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:33.390]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here on the road.
[00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.713]  I'll be back today, back tonight in Austin, Texas.
[00:31:36.713 --> 00:31:40.175]  I want to thank the crew for the great job that they are doing.
[00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:51.022]  I want to continue with the globalist onslaught, the globalist depopulation, world government takeover plan, the post-industrial, post-human operation that's been launched, Operation Lockstep, now known as the Great Reset.
[00:31:51.022 --> 00:31:55.345]  You will now learn, you will now see that this will never end until we arrest these people.
[00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:56.586]  Things only get worse from here.
[00:31:57.478 --> 00:32:09.188]  And once people are starving in the streets, as is already happening in the third world, they will use that starvation to control those giant masses of populations to politically hold everyone hostage.
[00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:16.034]  So, we're going to look back on these days as halcyon days that were completely safe, completely wonderful, and completely good.
[00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:23.700]  Owen Schroeder was really hitting some important points there at the last segment where we played the puppet show by saying, oh yeah, that's
[00:32:24.565 --> 00:32:28.848]  I do want to mandate vaccines, but I'm not sure it's legal.
[00:32:28.848 --> 00:32:30.769]  We need local governments to do it.
[00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:44.176]  So they want big tech corporations, they want malls, they want music venues, they want schools, they want the unions to do it in thousands of places so that you have to file thousands of lawsuits to stop them.
[00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:52.081]  And of course, the lawyers are so dumbed down or so controlled, they'll never actually sue the consortium groups and the UN and the Fortune 100, Microsoft.
[00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:59.277]  And Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and George Soros that are involved in the World ID system.
[00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:04.643]  So you'll have the systems, you'll have a few competing systems that all go back to the same database.
[00:33:04.643 --> 00:33:11.029]  And then people will just sue the school district, they'll just sue the venue, they'll just leave their church, the churches are going to bring all this in.
[00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:14.692]  They're going to be the tip of the spear of Satan because they're so controlled by it.
[00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.255]  And the Bible says what happened in these times.
[00:33:18.405 --> 00:33:22.168]  And so that's why they're trying to kill us with a thousand cuts.
[00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:23.509]  And remember, always denying.
[00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:25.330]  Oh, there's going to be no global ID.
[00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.112]  There's going to be no medical vaccine passport.
[00:33:28.112 --> 00:33:32.796]  Even though a year and a half ago, we had all the documents from the Rockefellers, all the documents from the Bill Gates Foundation.
[00:33:32.796 --> 00:33:37.980]  We knew every bit of it, how they were going to do it, when they were going to roll it out, what month they were going to do it.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.221]  And instead, now people think we're psychic.
[00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:41.682]  And the truth is, everybody's a little psychic.
[00:33:41.682 --> 00:33:42.583]  Everybody has intuition.
[00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:44.805]  But this isn't intuition, folks.
[00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:47.827]  We have all the admitted facts, because the public app-like
[00:33:49.312 --> 00:33:49.972]  I don't know.
[00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:21.754]  Because I'm not part of that Babylon system.
[00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:22.754]  And it doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:34:22.754 --> 00:34:24.215]  It doesn't mean I'm not connected to a lot of things.
[00:34:24.215 --> 00:34:25.616]  We're all connected to the world.
[00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:28.258]  But I'm in the world, but not of it.
[00:34:28.258 --> 00:34:30.279]  And I understand how the system operates.
[00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:31.580]  And so, it's here.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.062]  This is a biological, globalist takeover of humanity.
[00:34:35.062 --> 00:34:35.983]  They want to play God.
[00:34:35.983 --> 00:34:37.944]  They want to depopulate the planet.
[00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:39.285]  And they've made the decision to do it.
[00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:46.230]  And they've recruited massive, massive numbers of people to carry that out.
[00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.111]  Now, let's talk about solutions and fighting back.
[00:34:49.358 --> 00:34:53.459]  People will sit back and they'll say, this is so evil, this is so out of control, give it to God.
[00:34:53.459 --> 00:34:54.779]  And I totally agree.
[00:34:54.779 --> 00:35:02.140]  We can't beat ourselves up with frustration that this is so corrupt and, you know, feel like we're guilty that we can't individually change it.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:02.940]  We have to give it to God.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.881]  But what does the Bible say?
[00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:08.001]  Faith without works is dead.
[00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:16.663]  If you truly love God, if you hate corruption, you're going to be warning people and speaking out so that as things get worse, down the road, they're going to remember what you said
[00:35:17.424 --> 00:35:24.888]  And maybe it's five minutes before they get their head chopped off, you know, for not taking the mark of the beast.
[00:35:24.888 --> 00:35:25.389]  It won't matter.
[00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:36.015]  They'll still finally believe in God and understand this was a spiritual decision and finally not be delusional and turn their soul over to the truth, turn their soul over to reality, turn their soul over to God.
[00:35:36.015 --> 00:35:39.156]  And I'm just sorry, but that's the way this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:39.156 --> 00:35:45.400]  And I've told people this thousands of times on air 26 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, a month ago.
[00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:48.412]  I know I'll be attacked now for saying all this stuff.
[00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:50.633]  People think I'm crazy.
[00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:57.096]  But as it all unfolds, as the New World Order begins to launch these things, people will finally listen.
[00:35:57.096 --> 00:35:59.317]  And we've now reached that point.
[00:35:59.317 --> 00:36:05.080]  But we don't have 20 years to get people on board for what's coming because now it's all accelerated.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.162]  And so every one of you that shares an article or a video, every one of you that shoots your own video, every one of you that
[00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:11.244]  We're good.
[00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:48.630]  And exposing the fact that, again, submitting to the Globalist only makes things worse.
[00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.312]  When are people finally going to start saying no?
[00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:59.539]  That's a question you've got to ask them because giving in to having these chains put on you only makes them put the chains on tighter later.
[00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:02.041]  So that's why they squeeze and then release.
[00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:05.243]  Squeeze again, release again, but each time getting tighter.
[00:37:05.243 --> 00:37:11.088]  So by the time they've squeezed us down two or three times, we'll be at a level we'll never be able to get out of.
[00:37:11.798 --> 00:37:15.620]  And won't be resisting at the key moment when they finally break our neck.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:36.048]  And we're entering that neck-breaking area in the next year or two when they finally enforce these World ID's, when people are starving en masse, the borders are totally collapsed, and they're going to hold us hostage and say now, it's your fault you didn't take these ID's, it's your fault you didn't take these shots, and even when you finally give in, there's no foot in the store, and you go and you take the shots.
[00:37:38.027 --> 00:37:39.548]  It's only going to get worse after that.
[00:37:39.548 --> 00:37:43.949]  Just like all these people that took the shots because they were, quote, heroes, that was going to make them invincible.
[00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:46.250]  And now they learn they're actually the super spreaders.
[00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.410]  They're the ones causing it.
[00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:53.933]  The countries that have the highest rates of inoculation have the highest rates of death and disease because it's all a trap.
[00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:55.913]  It's all a spiritual delusion.
[00:37:55.913 --> 00:37:59.494]  And so people make fun of me for fighting the system.
[00:37:59.494 --> 00:38:02.515]  They ridicule because they've never been a man in the arena.
[00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:05.797]  And they say, oh, Jones, you're never going to be able to stop these people.
[00:38:05.797 --> 00:38:06.817]  Well, it's not my job to stop them.
[00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:19.665]  It's my job to inform people and educate people so they can make a spiritual decision that then a cultural, economic, financial decision will come from.
[00:38:19.665 --> 00:38:25.510]  I'm just here to make sure people know there's a decision they have to make, and I'm a tool of God just like everybody else is in this world.
[00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.712]  Even if you work for God or work for the devil, you're still in God's plan.
[00:38:28.712 --> 00:38:30.894]  And so, people make fun of Mike Lindell.
[00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:33.316]  Said we're going to prove election fraud.
[00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:34.277]  We're going to expose it.
[00:38:34.277 --> 00:38:35.398]  We're going to reinstate Trump.
[00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:40.765]  You have to have that belief, because they did steal the election, to have the confidence to ever have that happen.
[00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:45.909]  That's why the Justice Department's now gotten involved, telling 20-something states, you're not allowed to investigate elections.
[00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:49.391]  But that's totally unconstitutional what they're saying, because we know they stole it.
[00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:50.732]  And the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:38:50.732 --> 00:38:52.314]  And people are going to learn about hacking.
[00:38:52.314 --> 00:38:57.537]  And they're going to learn about how they won't turn over the digital data in all these states, because they were hacked into.
[00:38:57.537 --> 00:39:00.019]  They weren't just stuffing ballots that night.
[00:39:00.019 --> 00:39:04.222]  And so Mike Lindell is having an event that I'm going to be at, coming up on August
[00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:07.334]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:43.370]  When Fox News, because they would not even let him run an ad about his cyber security symposium, they say that doesn't exist, there is no digital hacking, even though we have hundreds of hours, literally, of Democrats in hearings in the last decade, including just two years ago and a year ago, right before the election, saying don't trust machines, hackers can get into them, it's all a fraud, we should decertify all these machines.
[00:39:45.512 --> 00:39:47.373]  Well, they were able to steal the election via the machines.
[00:39:47.373 --> 00:39:54.135]  Suddenly, they absolutely love the machines, and the Justice Department says it's an act of terrorism, literally, to even question the election.
[00:39:54.135 --> 00:39:54.555]  Well, you know what?
[00:39:54.555 --> 00:39:55.996]  It's an act of patriotism.
[00:39:55.996 --> 00:39:56.976]  It's my right and my duty.
[00:39:56.976 --> 00:40:05.219]  So, I've been on quasi-vacation, but a couple days ago, talked to Mike, talked to his crew, and I already knew basically what was coming.
[00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:10.001]  And I'm very, very honored at the fact that we're one of the main flagship groups that he's promoting the symposium through.
[00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:14.923]  And I can tell you, Mike is getting the biggest response he's ever had with InfoWars, because you listeners are awesome.
[00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:16.970]  You're doing really a great job.
[00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:24.857]  He's got a great line of products, but he's offering the biggest promo code ever now, which is really the promo code we have with this promo code, Alex.
[00:40:24.857 --> 00:40:30.242]  That's the highest rate because a lot of other talk show hosts have partnerships, but they want a little bit bigger percentage, which I get.
[00:40:30.242 --> 00:40:32.684]  So it's still great deals, but they still, you know,
[00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:38.975]  Each talk show host kind of tailors their own deal for what percentage they want to get from the percentage that's there.
[00:40:38.975 --> 00:40:47.823]  I said, whatever the best deal is for the customer, I want people to know I have the lowest prices on the pillows, and on the towels, and on the sheets, and on the human beds, the dog beds, the cat beds, and everything.
[00:40:47.823 --> 00:40:50.065]  I said, I want whatever the best deal is.
[00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:52.987]  He said, okay, that is the podcaster radio deal.
[00:40:52.987 --> 00:40:55.029]  That is up to 66% off.
[00:40:55.029 --> 00:40:57.271]  That is the best deal across the board, promo code Alex.
[00:40:58.544 --> 00:41:02.247]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:41:02.247 --> 00:41:11.754]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:18.418]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[00:41:18.418 --> 00:41:21.961]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[00:41:21.961 --> 00:41:24.383]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:24.383 --> 00:41:27.285]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.667]  But only for one more week.
[00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:32.149]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[00:41:32.149 --> 00:41:33.170]  But that's it.
[00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.573]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[00:41:35.573 --> 00:41:37.775]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:39.757]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:41:39.757 --> 00:41:41.058]  It's the highest quality.
[00:41:41.058 --> 00:41:42.219]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[00:41:42.219 --> 00:41:43.921]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[00:41:43.921 --> 00:41:47.444]  All ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:41:50.327 --> 00:41:58.215]  Again, InfoWarsTore.com, 10% off on high quality storable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can!
[00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.951]  The biosecurity state is here.
[00:42:01.951 --> 00:42:07.873]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[00:42:07.873 --> 00:42:21.658]  The corrupt, puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[00:42:23.098 --> 00:42:26.301]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:30.304]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[00:42:30.304 --> 00:42:32.086]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:42:32.086 --> 00:42:34.768]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[00:42:34.768 --> 00:42:37.030]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.572]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:42:39.572 --> 00:42:49.181]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:42:49.861 --> 00:42:51.262]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[00:42:51.262 --> 00:42:53.283]  We fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[00:42:53.283 --> 00:42:54.644]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[00:42:54.644 --> 00:42:56.265]  God bless and good luck.
[00:42:56.265 --> 00:42:57.786]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:06.372]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:43:06.372 --> 00:43:13.854]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:43:13.854 --> 00:43:16.175]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:43:16.175 --> 00:43:19.756]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:29.863]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:43:29.863 --> 00:43:35.768]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:46.497]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:43:46.497 --> 00:43:47.778]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:43:48.519 --> 00:44:00.108]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[00:44:00.108 --> 00:44:11.837]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[00:44:12.117 --> 00:44:19.203]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:44:19.203 --> 00:44:26.388]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:44:26.388 --> 00:44:30.952]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:44:31.212 --> 00:44:33.152]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:44:33.152 --> 00:44:42.494]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[00:44:42.494 --> 00:44:47.295]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[00:44:47.295 --> 00:44:51.436]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[00:44:51.436 --> 00:44:53.457]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:57.598]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[00:44:57.598 --> 00:44:58.958]  TheBiopros.com.
[00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:05.230]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:24.113 --> 00:45:31.839]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:34.661]  All right, folks.
[00:45:34.661 --> 00:45:38.785]  Alex Troyer, again, doing a great job there in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:38.785 --> 00:45:43.688]  I am just via the phone here trying to take some time off, but obviously that didn't happen.
[00:45:43.688 --> 00:45:45.910]  We've actually got a lot done while I've been out of town.
[00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.212]  It helped me just reset my brain.
[00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:53.176]  Let me just finish up what I was saying, because I didn't hear the break music, and just recap what I was getting into.
[00:45:54.489 --> 00:45:56.750]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena.
[00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.131]  Mike Lindell didn't back down.
[00:45:58.131 --> 00:46:07.595]  Everybody else deserted Trump and deserted the electoral process and deserted America during the globalist coup of November 2020.
[00:46:07.595 --> 00:46:10.876]  And then what we saw thereafter.
[00:46:10.876 --> 00:46:13.157]  And so they're never going to let us get out of this dictatorship.
[00:46:13.157 --> 00:46:16.079]  They're never going to stop the election fraud until we expose them.
[00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:18.120]  And they are deadly afraid we're doing it.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.821]  That's why Biden, again, two months ago, put out the June report
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:29.623]  On counterterrorism, saying the new mission is white people, people that question the election, people that are against lockdowns.
[00:46:29.623 --> 00:46:33.024]  I'm like, well, you know, lockdowns are already coming from the other documents, but there you go.
[00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:35.445]  I mean, they are going to do this and then say we're terrorists.
[00:46:35.445 --> 00:46:36.586]  Well, good luck.
[00:46:36.586 --> 00:46:39.827]  Let's just have the FBI start arresting people that are against lockdowns.
[00:46:39.827 --> 00:46:40.928]  See how that goes.
[00:46:40.928 --> 00:46:44.509]  I mean, these tyrants are basically out of political capital.
[00:46:44.509 --> 00:46:46.030]  People know who they are and they're scared.
[00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:49.371]  But, well, Mike Lindell having this conference saved the world.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:50.841]  Probably not.
[00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.663]  But will it put another dent in the enemy's armor?
[00:46:53.663 --> 00:46:54.484]  Abso-frickin-lutely.
[00:46:54.484 --> 00:46:57.707]  So Mike is incredibly optimistic.
[00:46:57.707 --> 00:46:58.667]  He's a great guy.
[00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.249]  He works 20 hours a day, a lot of the time.
[00:47:00.249 --> 00:47:02.250]  And he's very optimistic.
[00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.794]  So the enemy attacks him and says, oh, it'll probably be reinstated by August.
[00:47:05.794 --> 00:47:09.116]  Well, he's already reinstated the American people's mind.
[00:47:09.116 --> 00:47:11.538]  Eighty-plus percent of Republicans know it was stolen.
[00:47:11.538 --> 00:47:13.560]  Now it's up to 40 percent of Democrats.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.962]  That scares the hell out of the system.
[00:47:15.962 --> 00:47:16.563]  And every day,
[00:47:18.087 --> 00:47:21.428]  That number grows that the average American believes the election was stolen.
[00:47:21.428 --> 00:47:23.089]  I know a bunch of former Democrats.
[00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:27.030]  They all now aren't Republicans, but they don't like Biden to know he stole the election.
[00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.011]  So the mask is off right now.
[00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:43.416]  And so right now, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars gets a percentage of all of the sales that use the promo code at bipolo.com or frankspeech.com.
[00:47:43.416 --> 00:47:46.037]  And when you hear Mike Lindell in this one-minute video that I'm about to play,
[00:47:47.048 --> 00:47:47.809]  On the radio, you'll hear it.
[00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:49.050]  On TV, you'll see it.
[00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:53.493]  Say the best deal is speech site.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.134]  That's true.
[00:47:54.134 --> 00:47:56.856]  FrankSpeech.com with the promo code Alex.
[00:47:56.856 --> 00:48:04.282]  That gets you the very best deal of the best deal because that site is basically his podcaster deal, which is his best deal.
[00:48:04.282 --> 00:48:08.465]  And I think it's also a reflection of the fact that of all the deals he's got, they're all excellent.
[00:48:08.465 --> 00:48:10.927]  Again, he's got a lot of hundreds of other talk shows that work with him.
[00:48:11.793 --> 00:48:15.356]  Some people want a bigger percentage, so they sell the stuff for a little bit more.
[00:48:15.356 --> 00:48:18.158]  The talk show host gets a little bit better percentage for themselves.
[00:48:18.158 --> 00:48:19.459]  Again, I didn't do that.
[00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:32.548]  I go with the very best deal across the board, up to 66% off at frankspeech.com, promo code A-L-E-X, or you can simply go to mypullow.com, and again, use promo code Alex, you get the exact same deal.
[00:48:32.548 --> 00:48:34.830]  It is the very best deal you're going to get.
[00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.311]  And again, I've been talking to Mike quite a bit.
[00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:37.692]  He's going to be back on the show next week.
[00:48:37.692 --> 00:48:39.633]  He may even come down in studio with us.
[00:48:40.649 --> 00:48:43.711]  He's a demonized guy everybody says don't work with because they're scared of.
[00:48:43.711 --> 00:48:47.113]  I'm a demonized guy everybody says don't work with because they're scared of me.
[00:48:47.113 --> 00:48:53.077]  If we ever just start coming together as patriots, and Mike's exposed to vaccines as well, so-called vaccines, it's over for them.
[00:48:53.077 --> 00:48:55.159]  So I will be at the Cyber Symposium.
[00:48:55.942 --> 00:48:56.242]  I think so.
[00:49:26.494 --> 00:49:30.536]  He's doing a good job exposing election fraud, and it's critical that we do this together.
[00:49:30.536 --> 00:49:33.737]  If he just rolled over, they wouldn't try to indict him and his family.
[00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.538]  But he's not rolling over, so they're trying to indict him.
[00:49:35.538 --> 00:49:36.598]  It's like they're trying to indict me.
[00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:37.639]  But that's okay.
[00:49:37.639 --> 00:49:38.559]  I'm in a war.
[00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:39.820]  I signed on for this.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.640]  I'm right where I want to be.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.101]  So, here is the one-minute video.
[00:49:43.101 --> 00:49:44.501]  I hope you take this, and I hope you share it.
[00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:50.424]  And remember, the promo code is A-L-E-X at FrankSpeech.com or at MyPoll.com.
[00:49:50.424 --> 00:49:51.864]  Same place, same deals.
[00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:53.585]  Very best deals anywhere.
[00:49:53.585 --> 00:49:55.426]  You call the toll-free numbers with Mike Lindell.
[00:49:56.149 --> 00:50:00.770]  Just promo code A-L-E-X, baby, and you get the very best deals, and then it funds the InfoWars.
[00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.931]  I know he's spending 100% of the money coming in right now on this fight.
[00:50:03.931 --> 00:50:04.731]  We salute him.
[00:50:04.731 --> 00:50:10.192]  I'm spending almost everything coming in as well to expand and fight these devils, so please support us right now.
[00:50:10.192 --> 00:50:13.313]  You can also go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy all the products there as well.
[00:50:13.313 --> 00:50:15.533]  The X2 is getting very close to selling out.
[00:50:15.533 --> 00:50:16.033]  It's still 40% off.
[00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:21.954]  This is the last weekend to get 10% off with affordable food, all of that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:50:21.954 --> 00:50:25.395]  But here is the new promo video that Mike Lindell just sent me, actually.
[00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:33.452]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:50:33.452 --> 00:50:40.955]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:43.276]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:50:43.276 --> 00:50:46.757]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:50:48.775 --> 00:50:56.938]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:50:56.938 --> 00:51:02.841]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:10.004]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products.
[00:51:10.504 --> 00:51:13.866]  But they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:51:13.866 --> 00:51:24.332]  Go to FrankSpeech.com now and use the promo code on your screen or call the 1-800 number below to receive these exclusive MyPillow offers.
[00:51:24.332 --> 00:51:29.775]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:31.296]  All right, so there you go.
[00:51:31.296 --> 00:51:36.999]  The promo code is A-L-E-X at FrankSpeech.com or MyPillow.com.
[00:51:36.999 --> 00:51:37.500]  He's right.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.420]  Go to FrankSpeech.com.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.561]  You get the best deal you're going to find.
[00:51:40.345 --> 00:51:44.728]  Unless you use promo code Alex at mybullet.com because that is the best deal there is.
[00:51:44.728 --> 00:51:45.489]  Again, I've explained that.
[00:51:45.489 --> 00:51:51.052]  And that's why using Alex, you get the very best deal up to 66% off.
[00:51:51.052 --> 00:51:54.275]  That's just my gut level was to go with the biggest discount to the listeners.
[00:51:54.275 --> 00:51:58.938]  And even though we would bring in less money per order, I believe that everybody would know it was the best deal and do that.
[00:51:58.938 --> 00:51:59.899]  And we've done that.
[00:51:59.899 --> 00:52:02.320]  And so it's taken us from the red into the black.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.782]  We've been able to do a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[00:52:04.782 --> 00:52:06.043]  The fact that a lot of the listeners just
[00:52:06.664 --> 00:52:07.564]  One hell of a time to be alive.
[00:52:07.564 --> 00:52:11.226]  Listen, I got stacks of videos, stacks of articles, stacks of things to cover.
[00:52:11.226 --> 00:52:12.707]  There's so much unfolding.
[00:52:12.707 --> 00:52:17.149]  The Republicans are finally starting to find their guts, their huevos, like Owen was saying earlier.
[00:52:17.149 --> 00:52:33.557]  I've got a lot of stuff, you know, that I want to add as well, but just, you know, that Adon Salazar article, Owen, for me, is just really the big deal that countries with 98% inoculation rate with this deadly thing, and the others at 90%, Singapore at almost 80%,
[00:52:36.723 --> 00:52:38.965]  All of Iceland at 90 plus percent.
[00:52:38.965 --> 00:52:44.608]  They all have the highest outbreaks, the highest death rates, and they're, of course, dying from the inoculation.
[00:52:44.608 --> 00:52:45.629]  They're dying from the prions.
[00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.209]  They're dying from the crystals.
[00:52:47.209 --> 00:52:47.770]  And we know that.
[00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:48.870]  That's the science.
[00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:50.912]  Think of the boldness of this, Owen.
[00:52:50.912 --> 00:52:57.195]  So we've got to get the fact out that, no, it is the countries that are almost completely, quote, inoculated that are having the problems.
[00:52:57.195 --> 00:53:00.697]  That destroys the lies and the lockdowns that are going back in place.
[00:53:00.697 --> 00:53:01.378]  Do you agree with me, Owen?
[00:53:01.806 --> 00:53:02.966]  Well, and here's the thing, Alex.
[00:53:02.966 --> 00:53:12.490]  There's a reason why the Chinese Communist agents on CNN, like Dr. Lina Wen, or people you hear on NPR, talk the way they talk.
[00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:21.474]  They've been trained to be monotonous, sound like an autonomous bot, enunciate every little syllable, because that's part of the psychological operation.
[00:53:21.474 --> 00:53:30.898]  So, they don't like it when Alex Jones goes on air, or Owen Schroer goes on air, or Harrison Smith, or any of our great guests here, and we're flailing around and throwing papers in the air like, look at this!
[00:53:31.138 --> 00:53:32.318]  Look at these numbers in Israel!
[00:53:32.318 --> 00:53:33.319]  Look at these numbers!
[00:53:33.319 --> 00:53:34.979]  Look at these numbers in Iceland!
[00:53:34.979 --> 00:53:36.079]  Look at the VAERS report!
[00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.719]  They just deleted it off the website!
[00:53:37.719 --> 00:53:39.700]  Look at it in Israel, they just deleted all the numbers!
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.680]  Because it's like, this is real information.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.541]  We're not trained to propagandize to you.
[00:53:44.541 --> 00:53:55.283]  We just believe you're going to want to see this information, and it may shock you, it may change your life, you may completely just not even believe it at first, but then you realize, wait a second, these guys weren't lying to me.
[00:53:55.283 --> 00:53:57.184]  So, it's overwhelming.
[00:53:58.064 --> 00:54:15.453]  To sit here for a year and a half, be breaking this down a week ahead of the news cycle, a month ahead of the news cycle, a year ahead of the news cycle, on every different angle, simply because we've understood something that Republicans and other commentators are finally starting to understand, and the first response is always this.
[00:54:16.033 --> 00:54:18.054]  This doesn't make sense.
[00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:20.416]  It doesn't make sense they keep reversing the mask mandate.
[00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:24.159]  It doesn't make sense that the vaccinated are causing the new variants.
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:27.841]  It doesn't make sense that the nations that are the most vaccinated are having the outbreaks.
[00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:29.082]  But wait a second.
[00:54:29.082 --> 00:54:34.026]  It all makes sense as soon as you accept the fact that it was all by design.
[00:54:34.026 --> 00:54:35.967]  It's all a plan to conquer the world.
[00:54:35.967 --> 00:54:44.493]  I mean, hell, if Hitler had the technology or if Napoleon had the technology or Genghis Khan had the technology and the wherewithal to do all of this,
[00:54:44.813 --> 00:54:47.234]  They would have conquered the world a long time ago.
[00:54:47.234 --> 00:54:47.834]  You're right, Owen.
[00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:48.775]  And let me say something.
[00:54:48.775 --> 00:54:50.616]  I hope you do this next hour and be listening.
[00:54:50.616 --> 00:54:53.897]  You are so good at sports analogies because, you know, as a young man, you already got it.
[00:54:53.897 --> 00:54:57.859]  You know, we're doing a popular sports show in Missouri.
[00:54:57.859 --> 00:54:59.680]  Sports is archetypal battle.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.660]  It's archetypal chess.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.442]  You know, football is basically, you know, chess.
[00:55:04.442 --> 00:55:05.423]  And this is with real people.
[00:55:05.423 --> 00:55:08.864]  That's why we love it because we understand that it's based on things that are real.
[00:55:08.864 --> 00:55:10.065]  Ancient combat, ancient war.
[00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:11.319]  I think so.
[00:55:22.995 --> 00:55:24.337]  Millions of our people died.
[00:55:24.337 --> 00:55:25.398]  Millions starved to death.
[00:55:25.398 --> 00:55:27.340]  We're watching global criminals lie to us.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.785]  We're watching them lock us in our houses, put masks on our kids' faces.
[00:55:30.785 --> 00:55:38.734]  This isn't watching football, folks, where they get excited and, oh my god, he's running for the, he's at the 20, he's at the 10, he's in the goalpost, they won the Super Bowl.
[00:55:38.734 --> 00:55:41.237]  Folks, I liked watching Tom Brady last year because he was the underdog.
[00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:42.419]  I liked watching him not wear a mask.
[00:55:42.779 --> 00:55:43.820]  Because they hated it.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:44.781]  That made it political.
[00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:47.863]  So finally, I started watching football again, only because of Tom Brady.
[00:55:47.863 --> 00:55:49.024]  He's had a little bit of reality.
[00:55:49.024 --> 00:55:55.069]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:55:55.069 --> 00:56:02.576]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:56:02.576 --> 00:56:04.878]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:56:04.878 --> 00:56:08.461]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:56:10.362 --> 00:56:18.545]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:56:18.545 --> 00:56:24.448]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:56:24.448 --> 00:56:35.172]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:56:35.172 --> 00:56:36.453]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:56:37.213 --> 00:56:43.443]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[00:56:51.894 --> 00:56:57.338]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[00:56:57.338 --> 00:57:14.649]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[00:57:14.649 --> 00:57:15.490]  Worse than slaves.
[00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.272]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[00:57:19.457 --> 00:57:26.981]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:30.123]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world.
[00:57:30.123 --> 00:57:37.007]  We have to realize it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[00:57:37.007 --> 00:57:41.189]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[00:57:41.189 --> 00:57:43.390]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.651]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[00:57:45.651 --> 00:57:48.633]  It is a spiritual battle and M4 is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[00:57:52.614 --> 00:57:55.336]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:55.336 --> 00:58:11.150]  Alright, Alex Jones here in the final segment, and then I'm going to turn over the next two hours.
[00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:14.012]  Ellen Schreuer, the guest host, and everything else is coming up.
[00:58:14.012 --> 00:58:20.137]  And then I'm going to be doing special reports this weekend, and on Sunday I'll be there live as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:58:20.137 --> 00:58:20.818]  You better believe it.
[00:58:21.929 --> 00:58:47.349]  Just finishing up, you see people get excited, they put on their jerseys, that's their tribal outfit, uh, you know, their gang outfit, they go to the game, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you encamp outside the game, like you're the camp followers, following your armies, uh, and, and then you watch your armies do battle, and, but, but all of that is just because they understand psychology, and they're siphoning off your energy that should be in camping at the city council, in camping at the capitol peacefully.
[00:58:47.782 --> 00:58:50.624]  That should be encamping at your schools.
[00:58:50.624 --> 00:58:52.245]  That should be taking your culture back.
[00:58:52.245 --> 00:58:54.086]  The left isn't camping everywhere.
[00:58:54.086 --> 00:58:58.468]  They're physically dominating, and they want our children, and they're taking our children's minds.
[00:58:58.468 --> 00:58:59.128]  And they're innocent.
[00:58:59.128 --> 00:59:02.811]  So, now they want to put things in our body that are experimental.
[00:59:02.811 --> 00:59:04.652]  They're gaslighting us.
[00:59:04.652 --> 00:59:08.234]  And in most areas of the world, vaccination rates are at less than 10%.
[00:59:08.234 --> 00:59:10.295]  And by the way, they have low COVID numbers.
[00:59:10.295 --> 00:59:13.817]  But the places with the highest inoculation, you have the highest COVID numbers.
[00:59:13.817 --> 00:59:16.658]  And you now see that happen here, because as bad as we are at 49%,
[00:59:18.611 --> 00:59:20.972]  Uh, you know, the Indians are like six, seven percent.
[00:59:20.972 --> 00:59:30.514]  Look at places where they're subservient, like Singapore or Gibraltar or Iceland, where they're at 80 to 98 percent, depending on the country, and that's just a smoking gun.
[00:59:30.514 --> 00:59:39.996]  And so, if you get the Adan Salazar article, or write your own article, or other talk show hosts, other people put out articles about the smoking gun that, wait a minute, you know, you just said we all have the shot.
[00:59:40.737 --> 00:59:43.898]  There wouldn't be any of this going on, but everybody's taking the shot.
[00:59:43.898 --> 00:59:45.138]  Then we could overturn all this.
[00:59:45.138 --> 00:59:50.880]  Remember they said, oh, the Pfizer and Moderna, they're 92% of good, but the J&J's only 60.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.181]  All of that's a lie.
[00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.461]  All of it's false.
[00:59:54.461 --> 00:59:55.662]  All of it's fraud.
[00:59:55.662 --> 01:00:05.464]  I know this is hardcore stuff, and I'm very thankful to our affiliates, to our listeners, to everybody in this incredible time, but there's always been evil in the universe.
[01:00:05.464 --> 01:00:07.065]  And it's making its move right now.
[01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:10.246]  We have to understand that good is more powerful, but if we sit there on our hands,
[01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:15.616]  If we do nothing, then we have no chance or no shot against these people.
[01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:16.757]  But you're doing a great job.
[01:00:16.757 --> 01:00:18.638]  I see it everywhere.
[01:00:18.638 --> 01:00:20.819]  On TikTok, on Instagram, on Twitter, everywhere.
[01:00:20.819 --> 01:00:26.743]  Without even looking, people send me every day videos with 100,000 views, a million views, 700,000 views.
[01:00:26.743 --> 01:00:30.085]  And people are digging through the archives at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:30.586]  It's all free.
[01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:31.566]  It's all there.
[01:00:31.566 --> 01:00:37.990]  And they're going back and finding where we told everybody exactly what would happen, and it's having a huge effect.
[01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.631]  That really is
[01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.590]  We're good to go.
[01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:07.847]  You know, and he made predictions off their own government documents that he got, that we also covered months before, and I'm glad that he said it so eloquently.
[01:01:07.847 --> 01:01:08.527]  He did a great job.
[01:01:08.527 --> 01:01:18.613]  But I had them add to the article my predictions, not so that I got credit, but in my predictions I explained where it came from in the Rockefeller documents.
[01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:24.436]  And so, and Chris does that as well, it's just a short clip of him getting passed around that has like 10 million views last time, just in the last week.
[01:01:25.644 --> 01:01:30.045]  That part doesn't have the pudding in it.
[01:01:30.045 --> 01:01:35.106]  So people need to go to Band.Video or to FreeWorldNews.TV.
[01:01:35.106 --> 01:01:39.586]  They need to go to the Alex Jones Predictions page, because that page is not really visited.
[01:01:39.586 --> 01:01:40.527]  It doesn't have a lot of views.
[01:01:40.527 --> 01:01:43.467]  I mean, some of them have maybe a quarter million, a half million views.
[01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:44.887]  Those need 10 million views.
[01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:50.588]  Or get those, take clips out of them, and pull them out, because you don't know how powerful you are when you do that.
[01:01:50.588 --> 01:01:51.728]  A video might get 100 views.
[01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:52.389]  It might get 50,000.
[01:01:52.389 --> 01:01:53.829]  It might get 10 million.
[01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:54.749]  The point is that
[01:01:55.535 --> 01:01:57.256]  This stuff is coffin nails to the enemy.
[01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:59.277]  This stuff is like kryptonite to them.
[01:01:59.277 --> 01:02:01.899]  And so I'm telling you, listeners, you are everything.
[01:02:01.899 --> 01:02:08.343]  When you tell your neighbors about the radio station that carries us, when you share the live feed on your email, your text message, that's what gets past the censors.
[01:02:08.343 --> 01:02:11.645]  When you say, oh, look at this conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, what do you think?
[01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.765]  They won't ban you then.
[01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:16.288]  And link us on Twitter from freeworldnews.tv, the live feed of the show.
[01:02:16.288 --> 01:02:17.248]  It changes the world.
[01:02:17.248 --> 01:02:20.010]  So I don't want a bunch of spectators.
[01:02:20.894 --> 01:02:23.637]  I don't want to be the guy that has all the knowledge and then I control people with it.
[01:02:23.637 --> 01:02:26.961]  I want everybody to get the knowledge so we can all be free together into the future.
[01:02:26.961 --> 01:02:29.183]  The people perish for a lack of knowledge.
[01:02:29.183 --> 01:02:31.465]  Alright, I'm going to hand the baton over to Owen Stroyer.
[01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:33.207]  He's done a great job this week.
[01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:34.789]  I just want to thank all the listeners for your prayers.
[01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:36.190]  Pray for global awakening.
[01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.312]  Pray for the innocent children being targeted.
[01:02:38.312 --> 01:02:42.317]  And pray for justice through God to be brought against the New World Order.
[01:02:42.317 --> 01:02:42.717]  God bless.
[01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:43.458]  Owen Stroyer, take over.
[01:02:45.325 --> 01:02:46.647]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:51.613]  Alright, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna get into a lot of video clips and some of the breaking news.
[01:02:51.613 --> 01:02:53.676]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:53.676 --> 01:02:54.237]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:04.012]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:03:04.012 --> 01:03:11.515]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:03:11.515 --> 01:03:13.816]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:03:13.816 --> 01:03:17.397]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:03:19.318 --> 01:03:27.501]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:33.384]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:03:33.384 --> 01:03:44.128]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:03:44.128 --> 01:03:45.389]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:52.401]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:10.108]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:04:10.108 --> 01:04:11.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:13.769]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:04:13.769 --> 01:04:23.834]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:27.255]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:27.255 --> 01:04:37.200]  Before I get into this news here on my desk and these video clips that we've got ready for you today, I want to explain something.
[01:04:40.535 --> 01:04:48.021]  Most of this audience probably already understands, but we have new audience members tuning in every day.
[01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:59.330]  I'm always, I don't know if I should say pleasantly surprised, but I'm surprised when I'll meet people who will say, hey, you know, I love your broadcast.
[01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:02.312]  I love what InfoWars is doing.
[01:05:02.312 --> 01:05:04.654]  And you'll get to talking and I'll say, hey, when did you first tune in?
[01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:18.635]  And so many people will say, oh, I just tuned in in the year 2020, or I tuned in after they stole the election from Trump and you guys were the only ones being honest, or I tuned in when I saw the vaccine side effects and you guys were the only ones reporting on it.
[01:05:18.635 --> 01:05:31.745]  And so it's important to kind of cover the basics here that are just logical, common sense, human reasoning things.
[01:05:33.356 --> 01:05:44.171]  So that you can take that foundational knowledge or that foundational logic and then start to apply it to everything else that you see developing so that it does make sense.
[01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:49.878]  And that's why it's so frustrating when I see who are good Americans who aren't out to get you.
[01:05:51.016 --> 01:06:06.980]  But they've never really been hardcore and they've always wanted to stay on social media so they censor themselves and they want to make sure that they can do their hits on Fox News so they won't say anything too controversial or they like being invited to the big events so they can take a picture with Don Jr.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:12.661]  or whoever else is there to put on their social media and feel popular.
[01:06:12.661 --> 01:06:17.042]  But those individuals are starting to
[01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:26.295]  Ask a question, or they're starting to notice things, and I see the same quote over and over again.
[01:06:26.295 --> 01:06:29.178]  This doesn't make sense.
[01:06:29.178 --> 01:06:31.199]  This doesn't make sense.
[01:06:31.199 --> 01:06:36.264]  Specifically, when it comes to the vaccines, when it comes to the masks, when it comes to the lockdowns.
[01:06:36.264 --> 01:06:40.267]  This doesn't make sense.
[01:06:40.267 --> 01:06:45.192]  And so that's spurring a new level of an awakening process in these individuals,
[01:06:46.775 --> 01:06:54.403]  And they have to understand this basic core knowledge in order for things to make sense.
[01:06:54.403 --> 01:06:57.025]  It was never about a virus.
[01:06:57.025 --> 01:07:00.869]  It was never about protecting people.
[01:07:00.869 --> 01:07:05.213]  It was always about power.
[01:07:05.213 --> 01:07:08.377]  It was a global operation from day one.
[01:07:09.673 --> 01:07:19.638]  Planned with events like Crimson Contagion, Event 201, and many other quote-unquote drills that they run.
[01:07:19.638 --> 01:07:35.287]  So they could lock down humanity, set that precedent of medical tyranny around the world, and then build off of that a system of oppression in which the individual has no value, no perceived worth,
[01:07:36.403 --> 01:07:46.325]  And can be locked up and tied up and shackled or killed at any given time because that individual has no value.
[01:07:46.325 --> 01:07:49.546]  In fact, that individual is actually a bad thing, a negative.
[01:07:49.546 --> 01:07:50.746]  You're a virus spreader.
[01:07:50.746 --> 01:07:59.588]  You're a climate change person who drives a car, whatever.
[01:07:59.588 --> 01:08:00.288]  You know how they say it.
[01:08:03.052 --> 01:08:09.314]  When all these people are looking at the mass mandates and the vaccines and the lockdowns saying, this doesn't make sense.
[01:08:09.314 --> 01:08:10.875]  No, it does make sense.
[01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:13.016]  It's all part of an agenda.
[01:08:13.016 --> 01:08:15.877]  It's all part of a plan.
[01:08:15.877 --> 01:08:21.759]  And the endgame is total, global, medical tyranny.
[01:08:21.759 --> 01:08:24.200]  One world government.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.460]  And it's not even communist.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.681]  It's beyond communist.
[01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:28.902]  It's slavery is what it is.
[01:08:29.764 --> 01:08:34.232]  Communism would almost be a good thing compared to what it is they're rolling out for us.
[01:08:34.232 --> 01:08:43.068]  It's total slavery, it's the end of the individual, and it's getting to a point where a global government
[01:08:44.346 --> 01:08:56.509]  Can force-inoculate you, which could mean anything, could kill you if they wanted to, and you have no means of recusal, you have no means of fighting back, and you're actually bad if you think you do.
[01:08:56.509 --> 01:08:59.289]  You're bad if you think you have any individual rights.
[01:08:59.289 --> 01:09:02.830]  And this all seems extreme and it all seems impossible right now.
[01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:05.110]  That's where it's going.
[01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:07.591]  And so once you have that basic understanding,
[01:09:08.717 --> 01:09:14.878]  That this is a global population control, worldwide government medical tyranny operation.
[01:09:14.878 --> 01:09:18.459]  You no longer say, hey, this doesn't make sense they're waking me wearing a mask.
[01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:20.940]  Hey, this doesn't make sense they're making me locked down again.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.560]  Hey, this doesn't make sense the vaccinated are causing the spread.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.581]  No.
[01:09:24.581 --> 01:09:25.681]  It all makes sense.
[01:09:25.681 --> 01:09:33.723]  It has nothing to do with the virus and it has everything to do with building a one world government in which you, the individual, has no rights, no freedoms,
[01:09:34.847 --> 01:09:41.070]  And the government can come to your door and murder you if they see fit.
[01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:42.351]  Locking you up is one thing.
[01:09:42.351 --> 01:09:43.552]  They'd rather not even deal with that.
[01:09:43.552 --> 01:09:46.293]  They'd rather just come to your door, hey, you ready for your vaccine?
[01:09:46.293 --> 01:09:46.814]  Sure!
[01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:52.357]  And then they inject you, you fall deader than a hammer, they scrape you out in a body bag.
[01:09:52.357 --> 01:09:56.099]  Once you understand that, it all makes sense.
[01:09:56.099 --> 01:10:01.622]  Now here's three issues that if you understand the dichotomy of this,
[01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:22.193]  Or you can see the double standard or lies behind these dichotomies, then you understand how evil it is in its execution, then you can use these as examples to push back and get other humans to awaken to this tyranny that is encroaching.
[01:10:22.193 --> 01:10:27.475]  So, how about the southern border versus
[01:10:29.264 --> 01:10:31.848]  The spread of the new variants or the spread of COVID or whatever.
[01:10:31.848 --> 01:10:34.592]  It doesn't matter that they can't isolate the Delta variant.
[01:10:34.592 --> 01:10:41.604]  It doesn't matter that they admitted that the PCR test can't tell the difference between COVID or Delta or the flu.
[01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.866]  No, none of that matters, see?
[01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:53.061]  But the dichotomy that doesn't make sense, until you understand there's an agenda afoot, is how can they be telling us to be afraid of a spread?
[01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:58.605]  How can they be telling us we need to lock down, we need to wear masks, we need to do all this stuff because of a spread?
[01:10:58.605 --> 01:11:01.267]  Meanwhile, the southern border is wide open.
[01:11:01.267 --> 01:11:03.528]  Tens of thousands pouring over it every day.
[01:11:03.528 --> 01:11:04.589]  They don't wear masks.
[01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:07.691]  Many of them refuse vaccines.
[01:11:07.691 --> 01:11:08.952]  How can they get away with that?
[01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.597]  Again, that doesn't make sense.
[01:11:12.597 --> 01:11:15.418]  But it does make sense when you understand it was never meant to make sense.
[01:11:15.418 --> 01:11:17.859]  It's all part of an agenda.
[01:11:17.859 --> 01:11:23.621]  And in that smaller scope, smaller scale, to destroy the United States of America.
[01:11:24.693 --> 01:11:30.658]  So you're right, it doesn't make sense that we have to lock down and wear masks and live in fear of COVID while the southern border is wide open.
[01:11:30.658 --> 01:11:38.985]  But when you realize that the agenda is to enslave the American people and end the American country as a sovereign nation, oh, then it makes sense.
[01:11:38.985 --> 01:11:42.868]  Yeah, have people pour over the southern border while we lock down Americans.
[01:11:44.642 --> 01:11:49.465]  And anybody who doesn't see the double standard there is just a liar.
[01:11:49.465 --> 01:11:52.587]  Or climate change, man-made climate change.
[01:11:52.587 --> 01:12:04.575]  They want to harass you over man-made climate change, they want to tell you you have to change your way of life, you have to pay a carbon tax, you can't drive a car, you can't have a fireplace, you can't have A.C., you can't have heating, because of man-made climate change.
[01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:08.497]  But then, you sit here and you watch.
[01:12:08.497 --> 01:12:14.001]  The government in Dubai, the government in Russia, the government in China, the governments all around the world,
[01:12:15.876 --> 01:12:23.878]  Bragging about how they have weather machines and how they use weather machines and have for decades.
[01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:25.599]  So, but wait a second.
[01:12:25.599 --> 01:12:39.203]  You the individual is bad because of carbon emissions, but governments are literally working with weather machines to change the weather and they never talk about China who puts out more carbon emissions than every other industrialized country on earth combined.
[01:12:39.203 --> 01:12:40.364]  Well, that doesn't make sense.
[01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:42.344]  No, it does make sense.
[01:12:42.344 --> 01:12:44.645]  It's all about control of the population.
[01:12:45.885 --> 01:12:49.347]  And then there's the old pollution argument.
[01:12:49.347 --> 01:12:51.067]  Hey, I think everybody's against pollution.
[01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:53.088]  Does anybody like pollution?
[01:12:53.088 --> 01:12:57.630]  I don't think anybody likes pollution.
[01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:02.832]  But they use that as part of the climate change narrative because humans pollute.
[01:13:02.832 --> 01:13:03.293]  And they do.
[01:13:03.293 --> 01:13:04.293]  There's no denying it.
[01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:05.714]  I think it makes most people sick.
[01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:08.655]  I don't like seeing pollution.
[01:13:08.655 --> 01:13:12.377]  But a new story came out today.
[01:13:12.377 --> 01:13:15.098]  Over one and a half billion masks
[01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:26.314]  In the oceans, in the rivers, in the lakes, in the seas, have just been polluted all across the world, these masks.
[01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:29.497]  But yet, here they are again, bringing back the mask mandate.
[01:13:29.497 --> 01:13:33.580]  Two masks, three masks, mass-producing masks, and they're everywhere!
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:37.484]  It's now the number one pollutant in the world, is masks.
[01:13:37.484 --> 01:13:44.510]  And according to a study that just came out, it takes hundreds of years for these masks to bio-disintegrate.
[01:13:45.885 --> 01:13:53.970]  So you see, when you look at these issues and you see the double standard and you see the hypocrisy, it helps you understand that all of it's a lie.
[01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.051]  All of their leftist agendas are all just a lie.
[01:13:56.952 --> 01:14:03.035]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:10.539]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:14:10.539 --> 01:14:12.860]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.422]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:14:18.343 --> 01:14:26.527]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:14:26.527 --> 01:14:32.430]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:43.156]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:14:43.156 --> 01:14:44.417]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:14:45.197 --> 01:14:51.429]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:14:56.823 --> 01:15:04.346]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[01:15:04.346 --> 01:15:09.869]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[01:15:09.869 --> 01:15:17.732]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[01:15:17.732 --> 01:15:18.873]  Humanity is strong.
[01:15:19.193 --> 01:15:23.935]  We're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[01:15:23.935 --> 01:15:26.396]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:32.719]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:42.084]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.728]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:44.728 --> 01:15:47.392]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[01:15:47.392 --> 01:15:52.721]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:56.688]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[01:15:58.097 --> 01:16:08.450]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:11.974]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[01:16:11.974 --> 01:16:16.420]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[01:16:17.571 --> 01:16:18.412]  Well guess what?
[01:16:18.412 --> 01:16:32.406]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with ACT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[01:16:33.527 --> 01:16:35.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:26.244]  Something is lifting the veil on humanity right now.
[01:17:26.244 --> 01:17:28.045]  And it's all the lies of the mainstream media.
[01:17:28.045 --> 01:17:29.866]  It's all the lies of our politicians.
[01:17:29.866 --> 01:17:42.695]  It's just living your life, trying to see reality for what it is, and then seeing that reality be debated on television and in the halls of Congress.
[01:17:42.695 --> 01:17:45.857]  And so, there's these graphics going around
[01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:52.701]  To just illustrate the nonsense of it all, like for example this one right here that's going viral on Twitter.
[01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:55.142]  If the masks work, why the six feet?
[01:17:55.142 --> 01:17:57.803]  If the six feet works, why the masks?
[01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.824]  If they both work, why the lockdowns?
[01:17:59.824 --> 01:18:03.806]  If all three work, why do we rush the vaccines?
[01:18:03.806 --> 01:18:08.287]  If the vaccines are safe, why the no liability clause?
[01:18:08.287 --> 01:18:11.909]  If more people die from the vaccines than the virus, why use the vaccines?
[01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:18.404]  If we took two vaccines to keep others safe, why are the vaccinated now super spreaders?
[01:18:18.404 --> 01:18:22.266]  And if the vaccines work, why do vaccinated people have to wear masks again?
[01:18:22.266 --> 01:18:37.434]  So this is just one example of these graphics, these charts that are going around just asking basic common sense questions that of course make no sense because that is under the illusion that this was ever about a virus.
[01:18:37.434 --> 01:18:41.196]  That is under the delusion that our healthcare
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:53.207]  Alphabet bureaucracies ever cared about us, or that your local Democrat politician ever cared about you when they told you to wear a mask or take a vax.
[01:18:53.207 --> 01:18:54.348]  No.
[01:18:54.348 --> 01:19:07.579]  As soon as you realize this is all about controlling and enslaving you, and giving a one-world government medical tyranny the right to euthanize you whenever they see fit, then all of this makes sense.
[01:19:07.579 --> 01:19:12.063]  But until you accept that reality, none of it will make sense.
[01:19:14.394 --> 01:19:18.837]  But people are starting to get it.
[01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:23.680]  And, you know, in a way, look, they're not going to stop this, okay?
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:32.345]  They're not going to stop telling you to get 10 vaccines and wear 30 masks and whatever else they come up with next.
[01:19:32.345 --> 01:19:38.109]  And for example, like Fox News this morning has this graphic where they just get the numbers out of D.C.
[01:19:40.046 --> 01:19:44.287]  There have been four COVID deaths in the last two weeks in Washington, D.C.
[01:19:44.287 --> 01:19:45.147]  Four.
[01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.187]  Four COVID deaths.
[01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:54.669]  And you know that those are probably people that had comorbidities, meaning they had, you know, morbid obesity or some other issue, or were 90 years old.
[01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:57.809]  And there's been 11 homicides.
[01:19:57.809 --> 01:20:00.210]  11 homicides.
[01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:02.910]  And so people see that and they're just stunned.
[01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:06.011]  Because it was never about a virus, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:07.811]  It's always been about controlling you.
[01:20:10.034 --> 01:20:23.584]  And even though there's a great awakening and a mass awakening happening to all of this, even from people who went with the establishment lies and believe the establishment cared and took the vaccine and everything, they're having the greatest awakening of all right now because they were the ones that got duped.
[01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:24.965]  They were the ones that got fooled.
[01:20:24.965 --> 01:20:30.249]  They were the ones that thought, hey, if I wear the masks and I lock down and I take my vaccine, we can get back to normal.
[01:20:30.249 --> 01:20:35.313]  Now they're told, nope, you got to wear the mask, you got to lock down, and it's actually your fault because you took a vaccine.
[01:20:35.313 --> 01:20:36.174]  You're now a super spreader.
[01:20:40.626 --> 01:20:55.099]  But everybody has to make that final leap of reality, which is that anybody who's going to lie to you consistently, like Anthony Fauci, hates you.
[01:20:55.099 --> 01:20:59.483]  So Anthony Fauci hates you.
[01:20:59.483 --> 01:21:05.329]  Any politician telling you you need to wear a mask or suggesting that we force vaccines hates you.
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.342]  They hate you because you desire to be free.
[01:21:09.342 --> 01:21:12.285]  They hate you because you have a will to prosper.
[01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:15.228]  And they want to stop that.
[01:21:15.228 --> 01:21:17.911]  They want you to be enslaved.
[01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:20.914]  They want you to be impoverished.
[01:21:20.914 --> 01:21:28.301]  And they've even said by 2030 they want everybody living in a pod eating bugs with no private property.
[01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:29.543]  And you're already in 1984.
[01:21:33.442 --> 01:21:40.647]  With this imperial probe droid here, called a cellular phone, that spies on you 24-7.
[01:21:40.647 --> 01:22:01.340]  And it's even worse now because it's reaching a point, and we're learning this the hard way, that hey, even if you do try to have some sort of group, like some sort of fraternity or something like that, and you can say, alright guys, no cell phones here, we don't want the federal government spying on us, we just believe in freedom, doesn't mean you're doing anything illegal or
[01:22:02.441 --> 01:22:07.043]  Irresponsible or inappropriate just means, hey, we're just, we got our little group here.
[01:22:07.043 --> 01:22:20.170]  We don't want, you know, government agents spying on us, so we're going to put our cell phones at the door and we're going to go inside here to this pool hall or whatever and have some beverages and play some pool or play some poker and we're just going to have a night without government spies.
[01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:29.175]  But oh, see, now the federal government sends the spies into your group and tries to instigate you to do things that are illegal, like they did in Michigan.
[01:22:30.387 --> 01:22:32.290]  And like they certainly did in Washington, D.C.
[01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:45.648]  So, here is Matt Gaetz in clip 14, who's getting more hardcore as the days go by, thank God, talking about what happened in Michigan and how the exact same thing is likely what happened on January 6th.
[01:22:47.574 --> 01:22:50.257]  We did what members of Congress normally do.
[01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:53.561]  We showed up at the facility and sought a tour.
[01:22:53.561 --> 01:22:57.266]  This happens for Republicans under Democrat administrations.
[01:22:57.266 --> 01:23:00.329]  It happened for Democrats under Republican administrations.
[01:23:00.329 --> 01:23:02.872]  And now there is an unprecedented effort.
[01:23:03.613 --> 01:23:11.759]  To deny members of Congress information that relates to criminal cases and that relates to the treatment of people that are held.
[01:23:11.759 --> 01:23:14.762]  We are not members of Congress who will go away.
[01:23:14.762 --> 01:23:26.731]  And so if you are out in the country and you believe that you are mistreated, targeted, abused, singled out as a consequence of your politics and your lawful activity, know this.
[01:23:26.731 --> 01:23:28.872]  We will continue to fight for you.
[01:23:28.872 --> 01:23:32.135]  I now hand the microphone over to my colleague, Congressman Good.
[01:23:33.277 --> 01:23:45.324]  So, thank God there's Republican congressmen and women fighting against this crooked, rotten, communist, Democrat party, who has political prisoners being tortured in jail right now.
[01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:50.927]  And in that speech, Gates did mention the FBI setting up the man in Michigan.
[01:23:50.927 --> 01:23:52.127]  We did, what, members of Congress?
[01:23:57.864 --> 01:24:05.769]  They get caught red-handed in Michigan and it's barely even a news story because the mainstream news is also infiltrated by Feds.
[01:24:05.769 --> 01:24:08.530]  It's called Project Mockingbird.
[01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:16.856]  And we learned even more about that when Donald Trump, as the 45th President of the United States, declassified the JFK papers.
[01:24:16.856 --> 01:24:27.182]  And we found out that the CIA and the FBI has men and women inside of newsrooms, on television, behind the scenes, producing, editing, everything.
[01:24:28.379 --> 01:24:37.943]  And they ran an operation after JFK was assassinated to cover it up and blame the lone gunman.
[01:24:37.943 --> 01:24:41.665]  Even though, according to their own documents, they believe that there were multiple shooters.
[01:24:41.665 --> 01:24:47.127]  It's their FBI, CIA documents, all declassified under Donald Trump.
[01:24:47.127 --> 01:24:49.348]  And you'll notice that the mainstream news barely even covered it.
[01:24:49.348 --> 01:24:49.628]  Why?
[01:24:49.628 --> 01:24:50.629]  Because they're feds!
[01:24:52.403 --> 01:24:54.925]  Because they're Chinese communist agents!
[01:24:54.925 --> 01:24:59.908]  Because they're CIA, FBI, Operation Mockingbird agents!
[01:24:59.908 --> 01:25:03.491]  It all came out in the Frank Church hearings!
[01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:14.719]  And so that's the problem is, we just sit here, and we deal with the same corruption because we never root it out, and it's like cancer metastasizing, and it only gets worse!
[01:25:15.916 --> 01:25:17.917]  The news has always been corrupt.
[01:25:17.917 --> 01:25:20.138]  Politicians have always been corrupt.
[01:25:20.138 --> 01:25:30.864]  But we the people have never taken a stand to actually rid our institutions of all these corrupt individuals.
[01:25:30.864 --> 01:25:38.268]  And maybe now that the world is waking up to how bad it is, maybe now that Americans are waking up to how bad it is, maybe now that Republicans are waking up to how bad it is,
[01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.523]  I've got a statement from Ted Cruz when we come back from this break.
[01:25:42.523 --> 01:25:44.905]  Remember what Donald Trump said?
[01:25:44.905 --> 01:25:48.628]  I knew it was bad, but I had no idea it was this bad.
[01:25:48.628 --> 01:25:56.013]  Yeah, we're talking about murderous, psychotic liars that are in every institution of our government wielding their power against us.
[01:25:57.082 --> 01:25:59.944]  The biosecurity state is here.
[01:25:59.944 --> 01:26:05.869]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:19.660]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[01:26:21.101 --> 01:26:24.304]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:28.308]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:30.089]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:32.191]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[01:26:32.191 --> 01:26:33.793]  They're now implementing it.
[01:26:33.793 --> 01:26:35.014]  And now they've announced that U.S.
[01:26:35.014 --> 01:26:37.576]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:26:37.576 --> 01:26:47.165]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[01:26:47.986 --> 01:26:51.294]  I don't know how long we can.
[01:26:51.294 --> 01:26:52.658]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[01:26:52.658 --> 01:26:54.282]  God bless and good luck.
[01:26:54.282 --> 01:26:55.806]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[01:26:56.707 --> 01:27:02.091]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:06.954]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[01:27:06.954 --> 01:27:11.817]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:27:11.817 --> 01:27:14.699]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:27:14.699 --> 01:27:18.061]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:18.061 --> 01:27:19.282]  You've got red blood.
[01:27:19.282 --> 01:27:26.207]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[01:27:26.807 --> 01:27:29.729]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:27:29.729 --> 01:27:33.591]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:27:33.591 --> 01:27:36.492]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:27:36.492 --> 01:27:41.395]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:27:41.395 --> 01:27:44.016]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:27:44.016 --> 01:27:48.399]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:27:48.399 --> 01:27:52.521]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:55.483]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[01:27:55.483 --> 01:27:55.863]  God bless.
[01:27:57.287 --> 01:28:03.374]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:28:03.374 --> 01:28:10.862]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:28:10.862 --> 01:28:13.184]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:28:13.184 --> 01:28:16.748]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:26.833]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:28:26.833 --> 01:28:32.736]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:28:32.736 --> 01:28:43.480]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.741]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:28:45.521 --> 01:28:51.968]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:28:51.968 --> 01:28:53.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:29:14.036 --> 01:29:16.177]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is just incredible.
[01:29:16.177 --> 01:29:26.462]  Alex Jones about to rejoin us here from the road, but CNN, of all people, has just vindicated InfoWars.
[01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:30.064]  Vaccination alone, this is from CNN, mind you.
[01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:37.728]  Vaccination alone won't stop the rise of variants, and in fact could push the evolution of new strains.
[01:29:42.089 --> 01:29:43.650]  These bastards, man!
[01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:46.411]  They knew it all along, man!
[01:29:46.411 --> 01:29:51.714]  And, uh, the story that just went up, vaccination is not enough by itself to stop the spread of the variant, study finds.
[01:29:51.714 --> 01:29:53.775]  And then it gets into this whole thing.
[01:29:53.775 --> 01:29:55.396]  So, so, here's what they're doing now.
[01:29:57.337 --> 01:30:06.523]  They've now decided they can't put the genie back in the bottle, that the vaccinated people are causing the mutations, and the vaccinated people are the super spreaders.
[01:30:06.523 --> 01:30:08.024]  So what are they doing now?
[01:30:08.024 --> 01:30:11.006]  Well, now they're just using that as more fear-mongering.
[01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:17.531]  Now they're just using it as more fear-mongering, so without actually admitting that the vaccines are causing this,
[01:30:18.351 --> 01:30:30.775]  They just kind of nuance, subliminally admit that the vaccinated people are causing the mutations and the spread, but then they just use that as more fear-mongering and hope that you don't realize they just admitted everything.
[01:30:30.775 --> 01:30:37.577]  So, oh, we're admitting the vaccinated people are causing the mutations and the spread, but no, that just means you need to be in fear.
[01:30:37.577 --> 01:30:42.019]  Don't look at the fact we pushed the vaccines and they're still not FDA approved and we lied about everything.
[01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:44.920]  No, no, no, ignore that and just be afraid again.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:55.387]  And again, we had doctors on this broadcast, on our morning show, on the drive-time show, afternoon drive that I host, and all the doctors said the same thing, Alex.
[01:30:55.387 --> 01:30:58.429]  This is not even, I mean, this is basic science.
[01:30:58.429 --> 01:31:01.431]  I never took a medical course, and I understand this.
[01:31:01.431 --> 01:31:08.676]  But the fact that they're now admitting this, Alex, and using it as fear-mongering, I mean, look, they're in desperate times, Alex.
[01:31:08.676 --> 01:31:13.200]  I mean, they're going for everything, and we know it, and these people are more dangerous than ever.
[01:31:14.494 --> 01:31:16.115]  But their desperation shows.
[01:31:16.115 --> 01:31:19.416]  OK, we're going to be joined by Alex here momentarily.
[01:31:19.416 --> 01:31:23.698]  Again, though, folks, I can't even.
[01:31:23.698 --> 01:31:24.439]  I'm so overwhelmed.
[01:31:24.439 --> 01:31:29.581]  Let me just go through this news as we're going to be joined by Alex Jones here momentarily.
[01:31:29.581 --> 01:31:35.043]  Biden orders federal workers, including military, to vaccinate or face regular coronavirus tests.
[01:31:35.043 --> 01:31:42.247]  Now, again, every every one of these headlines that I'm covering right now needs the backdrop of the admission that they just made on CNN.
[01:31:44.093 --> 01:31:54.679]  So even though the vaccinated people are causing the super spread, and the vaccinated people are causing more dangerous mutations, Biden wants to force you to get a vaccine.
[01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:59.442]  That's mandated death from that decrepit old husk!
[01:31:59.442 --> 01:32:01.283]  That rotting old husk!
[01:32:01.283 --> 01:32:02.764]  That bastard!
[01:32:02.764 --> 01:32:04.565]  Belongs in jail yesterday!
[01:32:06.152 --> 01:32:06.432]  U.S.
[01:32:06.432 --> 01:32:12.298]  Surgeon General recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks outdoors to protect the unvaccinated!
[01:32:12.298 --> 01:32:15.181]  They're admitting everything!
[01:32:15.181 --> 01:32:16.902]  They're admitting everything!
[01:32:16.902 --> 01:32:20.886]  To protect the unvaccinated!
[01:32:20.886 --> 01:32:21.967]  Folks, they're admitting it!
[01:32:21.967 --> 01:32:24.129]  The vaccinated people are killing people!
[01:32:24.129 --> 01:32:26.311]  The vaccinated people are causing the spread!
[01:32:26.311 --> 01:32:28.753]  The vaccinated people are causing the mutations!
[01:32:28.753 --> 01:32:29.974]  They're admitting the whole thing!
[01:32:31.036 --> 01:32:34.460]  This should be game over, man!
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.342]  This should be game over!
[01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:38.925]  We shouldn't be playing ball with these people anymore!
[01:32:38.925 --> 01:32:40.607]  They all need to be arrested!
[01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:44.758]  They all need to be in jail, rotting away!
[01:32:44.758 --> 01:32:46.078]  Not the people that were in D.C.
[01:32:46.078 --> 01:32:47.219]  on January 6th!
[01:32:47.219 --> 01:32:49.560]  Fauci needs to be in jail, rotting away!
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.842]  Biden needs to be in jail, rotting away!
[01:32:51.842 --> 01:33:01.167]  All these bastards in our government that forced this experimental vaccine on us, that's now killing people, and we haven't even begun to see the tip of this iceberg!
[01:33:01.167 --> 01:33:03.868]  They all belong in jail, rotting!
[01:33:03.868 --> 01:33:04.989]  But now they just admit it!
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.602]  See, now they just come out and they just admit it.
[01:33:08.602 --> 01:33:11.684]  Oh yeah, the vaccinated caused the deadly mutations.
[01:33:11.684 --> 01:33:13.946]  Oh yeah, the vaccinated people are causing the spread.
[01:33:13.946 --> 01:33:18.950]  So, vaccinated people, you need to wear the mask or you're going to cause a super spreader event.
[01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:20.811]  You're going to kill more people.
[01:33:20.811 --> 01:33:22.332]  Unbelievable.
[01:33:22.332 --> 01:33:23.293]  Unbelievable.
[01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:27.036]  Hey, this isn't Infowars telling you this.
[01:33:27.036 --> 01:33:29.478]  This is now CNN.
[01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:30.979]  This is now the Biden White House.
[01:33:32.332 --> 01:33:33.733]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:38.557]  Oh, they just admit it, but the COVID tyranny doesn't go away.
[01:33:38.557 --> 01:33:47.304]  Broadway theaters to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for guests, and you must wear a mask when attending a Broadway play.
[01:33:47.304 --> 01:33:54.050]  Oh, but they'll be spitting all over the place, all the vaccinated Broadway actors, telling you how bad you are, probably, you know, telling you how racist you are.
[01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:55.751]  That's Broadway now.
[01:33:55.751 --> 01:33:57.953]  And, oh, the vaccine is so good.
[01:33:59.428 --> 01:34:09.671]  Because you're so afraid of a virus, the Biden administration is now proposing $100 cash incentive for you to get a vaccine.
[01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:13.812]  So remember, they tried the vaccine lottery, they couldn't get the numbers to go up.
[01:34:13.812 --> 01:34:15.593]  So now they're just giving you a direct payout, $100.
[01:34:15.593 --> 01:34:18.574]  And you know what's funny?
[01:34:18.574 --> 01:34:20.935]  The people that have been vaccinated are actually the most pissed about this.
[01:34:20.935 --> 01:34:22.795]  They're like, well, where's my money?
[01:34:22.795 --> 01:34:25.856]  I signed up, I got vaccinated, I passed out, I was in bed for a week.
[01:34:25.856 --> 01:34:27.377]  I almost died after getting the vaccine.
[01:34:27.377 --> 01:34:27.777]  Where's my $100?
[01:34:29.517 --> 01:34:31.617]  Pathetic.
[01:34:31.617 --> 01:34:41.800]  And of course you have other companies like restaurants and Walmart and other places saying they'll pay their employees to get vaccinated.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:46.981]  I mean, again, what do your parents tell you?
[01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:50.922]  Someone comes up in a van and says, I've got ice cream in the truck.
[01:34:50.922 --> 01:34:52.282]  You don't get in the truck.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:58.482]  You know, some stranger comes up to you and says, Hey, Johnny, you want a lollipop?
[01:34:58.482 --> 01:35:00.843]  Hey, little Susie.
[01:35:00.843 --> 01:35:02.704]  Hey, you know, just get in my car.
[01:35:02.704 --> 01:35:03.964]  Hey, I've got money for you.
[01:35:03.964 --> 01:35:05.605]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.605 --> 01:35:07.786]  I mean, that's basic instincts.
[01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:13.569]  You don't get into the, you don't get into the man in the truck to get a free ice cream cone.
[01:35:13.569 --> 01:35:14.509]  But that's the globalist.
[01:35:14.509 --> 01:35:15.209]  That's Bill Gates.
[01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.610]  That's Anthony Fauci.
[01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:20.812]  Hey, little buddy, I've got a vaccine for you.
[01:35:22.332 --> 01:35:25.056]  Here's a hundred dollars, take my vaccine!
[01:35:25.056 --> 01:35:28.321]  It's like Pennywise the Clown in the sewer.
[01:35:28.321 --> 01:35:31.205]  We've got hot dogs and popcorn.
[01:35:31.205 --> 01:35:33.408]  Can't you hear the circus?
[01:35:33.408 --> 01:35:35.591]  Can't you hear the circus, little Georgie?
[01:35:37.862 --> 01:35:49.171]  Little Georgie sees the demon, and he sees the fangs, and he sees the clown makeup, and his instinct is, this is, I don't want to go down in the sewer with this, but there's popcorn, Georgie!
[01:35:49.171 --> 01:35:55.936]  There's peanuts and elephants and circuses in town and hot dogs and cotton candy!
[01:35:55.936 --> 01:35:57.076]  That's Fauci.
[01:35:57.076 --> 01:35:58.037]  That's Bill Gates.
[01:35:58.037 --> 01:35:58.858]  That's Joe Biden.
[01:36:00.944 --> 01:36:05.149]  Oh, come on down and get vaccinated!
[01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:13.479]  You're like, wait a second, the vaccine is killing people and it's causing mutations and vaccinated people are saying that they're spreading it now.
[01:36:13.479 --> 01:36:14.080]  But there's
[01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:16.702]  But there's $100!
[01:36:16.702 --> 01:36:31.693]  I mean, literally, remember, you get free donuts, you get free beers, you get all this free garbage to take their experimental vaccine that could kill you better than a hammer, paralyze you, make you amputate your hands and legs.
[01:36:31.693 --> 01:36:32.694]  These are all real cases.
[01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:43.451]  And we don't even have the basic instinct, like parents and children, when you teach your kids, you don't get in the van with the guy offering you an ice cream cone.
[01:36:43.451 --> 01:36:47.852]  You don't get in the truck with the guy offering you a lollipop.
[01:36:47.852 --> 01:36:49.172]  That's who these people are.
[01:36:49.172 --> 01:36:52.253]  Why would you get in the van with them?
[01:36:52.253 --> 01:36:56.034]  To be medically raped by these demonic psychotics.
[01:36:59.071 --> 01:37:04.875]  Synd government asks NCOC to block SIM card social media accounts of unvaccinated people.
[01:37:04.875 --> 01:37:10.679]  Yeah, they don't want you telling people, hey, I didn't get the vaccine and I'm fine.
[01:37:10.679 --> 01:37:15.603]  Australian military to help enforce Sydney COVID-19 lockdown as cases rise.
[01:37:15.603 --> 01:37:17.004]  By the way, oh, cases rise.
[01:37:17.004 --> 01:37:20.026]  There's like seven cases on the entire continent.
[01:37:20.026 --> 01:37:21.067]  Yeah, cases rise.
[01:37:21.067 --> 01:37:23.709]  We went from five cases to seven in Australia.
[01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:25.010]  It's a serious pandemic.
[01:37:26.064 --> 01:37:29.947]  Again, it's like in Washington, D.C., where they just went back to total COVID tyranny.
[01:37:29.947 --> 01:37:32.229]  Four COVID deaths in the last two weeks.
[01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:34.290]  Four COVID deaths in the last two weeks.
[01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:36.532]  Eleven homicides.
[01:37:36.532 --> 01:37:38.093]  The Democrats are the virus.
[01:37:38.093 --> 01:37:40.114]  The mainstream media is the virus.
[01:37:40.114 --> 01:37:42.476]  You want to get rid of the virus?
[01:37:42.476 --> 01:37:43.837]  Get rid of the Democrat Party.
[01:37:43.837 --> 01:37:45.178]  Get rid of the mainstream media.
[01:37:45.178 --> 01:37:48.681]  Then you'll get rid of the virus.
[01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:49.501]  It's just incredible.
[01:37:49.501 --> 01:37:50.022]  And by the way,
[01:37:52.659 --> 01:37:53.920]  I'm hosting the War Room today.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.180]  It's the Veterans Call-In Show.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:59.062]  I think today's Veterans Call-In Show on the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:37:59.062 --> 01:38:01.363]  Central, streaming live at Band Out Video.
[01:38:01.363 --> 01:38:11.287]  I think this is going to be a very powerful one, because I know that our great veterans in this country that put everything on the line for this country are just flipping mad right now.
[01:38:13.223 --> 01:38:18.805]  And they, it's beyond the mistreatment that veterans have had for so many years.
[01:38:18.805 --> 01:38:23.187]  It's beyond coming back to the West and seeing all of your freedoms ripped away.
[01:38:23.187 --> 01:38:40.775]  It's now reached a point where veterans don't even recognize this country anymore and they sit here and they think they've been, they've traveled the world to fight for freedom and now there's more oppression and more tyranny and more crime in the United States than the countries where they did tours at.
[01:38:42.168 --> 01:38:45.950]  So, today's Veterans Call-In Show in the War Room is going to be a must-listen.
[01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:47.211]  We're trying to get connected to Alex.
[01:38:47.211 --> 01:38:55.537]  We may have him on the other side of this break, but hey, CNN, Fauci, Biden all admit the vaccines are spreading the disease and causing mutations.
[01:38:55.537 --> 01:39:04.062]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:04.062 --> 01:39:08.585]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[01:39:09.045 --> 01:39:14.648]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:17.549]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[01:39:17.549 --> 01:39:18.730]  Listen to this.
[01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:28.895]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[01:39:28.895 --> 01:39:32.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[01:39:32.336 --> 01:39:33.597]  Just one of these ingredients
[01:39:33.797 --> 01:39:36.178]  It can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[01:39:36.178 --> 01:39:40.921]  And we've packed it all in to Fiber Green Caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:44.823]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[01:39:44.823 --> 01:39:47.004]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[01:39:47.004 --> 01:39:49.866]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[01:39:49.866 --> 01:39:51.366]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:59.804 --> 01:40:00.944]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:40:00.944 --> 01:40:01.765]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:40:01.765 --> 01:40:02.945]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:40:02.945 --> 01:40:03.405]  Go ahead.
[01:40:03.405 --> 01:40:03.925]  Hey, Alex.
[01:40:03.925 --> 01:40:06.546]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[01:40:06.546 --> 01:40:07.586]  I am a granny.
[01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:17.249]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:40:17.249 --> 01:40:23.251]  But since taking Eurex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:24.271]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:40:26.552 --> 01:40:34.253]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:40:34.253 --> 01:40:43.015]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:40:43.015 --> 01:40:43.835]  This is working.
[01:40:43.835 --> 01:40:44.835]  This is wonderful.
[01:40:44.835 --> 01:40:49.376]  You know, I don't I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:54.017]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:40:57.111 --> 01:41:05.280]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:14.049]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[01:41:14.049 --> 01:41:16.011]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[01:41:16.391 --> 01:41:20.955]  In a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:43:21.337 --> 01:43:41.248]  I want to play a quick clip here from a doctor who has decided to quit his job like many great nurses who were heroes a year ago being on the front lines but now don't want to be forced inoculated with a deadly experimental vaccine.
[01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.409]  Now all of a sudden they're the zeros of their communities.
[01:43:43.409 --> 01:43:45.531]  It's amazing how quickly establishment will turn on you.
[01:43:45.531 --> 01:43:47.612]  It's amazing how quickly a liberal Democrat will turn on you.
[01:43:49.016 --> 01:43:54.520]  And this doctor explains why he left his job as a doctor.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.442]  And of course, it has to do with the COVID tyranny and the forced vaccines.
[01:43:58.442 --> 01:43:59.303]  Here he is.
[01:43:59.303 --> 01:44:03.746]  Hi, everyone.
[01:44:03.746 --> 01:44:06.188]  My name's Dr. Sam.
[01:44:06.188 --> 01:44:13.773]  I just want to share a story with you today about how I came to resign at the beginning of the year, really.
[01:44:13.773 --> 01:44:14.793]  I had a job for life.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:19.123]  I'm a partner in a GP practice.
[01:44:19.123 --> 01:44:24.247]  I've been a doctor since 2004, so 17 years.
[01:44:24.247 --> 01:44:27.310]  The last 11 in general practice.
[01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:35.838]  Also until recently working in the emergency department and a few years before that I helped run a palliative care hospice as well.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:44.186]  I had to go because that was the only thing I could do, really, because of the lies.
[01:44:44.186 --> 01:44:53.154]  And the lies over the last year or so have been so vast, it's been impossible to stomach or tolerate.
[01:44:53.154 --> 01:44:58.960]  I went to medical school in good faith because I wanted to help people and make a difference.
[01:45:00.692 --> 01:45:13.709]  That's not what's happened this year and it's been as if my hands and those of many other doctors and nurses who perhaps have been afraid to come forward have had their hands tied behind their backs.
[01:45:16.913 --> 01:45:32.176]  There are treatments available, safe treatments, proven treatments, with lots of evidence to back that up, including treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, which can be used for both prophylaxis and in treatment.
[01:45:32.176 --> 01:45:40.858]  Even a simple inhaler called budesonide has been found to be effective by a doctor who works in the emergency department in the States.
[01:45:43.241 --> 01:46:01.333]  So what I'm asking today is that you do your own research, and I'm going to tag in this video a lot of doctors, perhaps more eminent than myself, who've done a lot of work exposing what's going on.
[01:46:01.333 --> 01:46:07.336]  So there's more to this video, but that's just kind of the meat of it right there.
[01:46:07.336 --> 01:46:07.977]  And you know what?
[01:46:07.977 --> 01:46:09.598]  That's the answer, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:10.967 --> 01:46:13.009]  That's the answer.
[01:46:13.009 --> 01:46:32.726]  And the problem is our economies have been so rigged, our monetary supplies have been so rigged by the establishment that most people sadly, whether it's police officers or doctors or what have you,
[01:46:34.246 --> 01:46:44.193]  Can't afford to take the risk of quitting their job because they need the money to pay bills, you know, to help their family, whatever the case may be.
[01:46:44.193 --> 01:46:47.755]  But that's the answer, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:47.755 --> 01:46:54.080]  People inside mainstream media networks need to just start blowing the whistle on all the fake news stuff that they see behind the scenes.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.501]  You're seeing that with Project Veritas.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:07.825]  People inside police departments, but specifically the Capitol Police, need to come forward and quit their job and make statements about how politicized and corrupt the Capitol Police has become by the Democrat Party.
[01:47:07.825 --> 01:47:19.950]  Doctors and nurses, and we've seen so many, but it needs to just be just a tidal wave of them, need to come forward, much like that doctor, and say, look, I got into medicine to help people.
[01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:31.984]  And right now the system is not letting me help people and I have to come across COVID patients every day and I can't even treat them with things we know work.
[01:47:31.984 --> 01:47:36.630]  And perhaps the canary in the coal mine is actually Mexico right now.
[01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:37.291]  In Mexico,
[01:47:39.298 --> 01:47:44.962]  Doctors are allowed to treat COVID with hydroxychloroquine and with ivermectin.
[01:47:44.962 --> 01:47:48.284]  You notice how you don't hear about COVID cases in Mexico?
[01:47:48.284 --> 01:47:51.626]  You notice how you don't hear about big COVID number deaths in Mexico?
[01:47:51.626 --> 01:47:52.587]  You know why?
[01:47:52.587 --> 01:47:56.649]  Because their doctors are allowed to do their job.
[01:47:56.649 --> 01:48:01.252]  Hydroxychloroquine with zinc and vitamin D and other things works against COVID.
[01:48:01.252 --> 01:48:03.514]  Ivermectin works against COVID.
[01:48:03.514 --> 01:48:05.235]  Those are just two treatments that people know work.
[01:48:06.738 --> 01:48:20.631]  So think about how sick and corrupt the medical establishment is, and the mainstream media is, that they would keep known cures for COVID from the public.
[01:48:20.631 --> 01:48:25.816]  That right there, that crime against humanity right there needs to be punished immediately.
[01:48:25.816 --> 01:48:27.618]  And they'll never be held accountable.
[01:48:27.618 --> 01:48:30.761]  Anthony Fauci will never be held accountable, but I hope he will be.
[01:48:30.761 --> 01:48:31.782]  I hope Anthony Fauci
[01:48:33.024 --> 01:48:37.729]  Endures a similar style or just the same thing as the Nuremberg trials.
[01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:44.715]  And he's made an example of, we're no longer going to have corrupt people like Anthony Fauci running our healthcare systems.
[01:48:44.715 --> 01:48:51.822]  And if anybody as corrupt as Anthony Fauci tries to get in control again, just know your fate will be whatever Anthony Fauci's fate is.
[01:48:53.945 --> 01:49:00.655]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, that's a doctor who quit his job because they weren't letting him help patients.
[01:49:00.655 --> 01:49:02.658]  Think about how sick that is.
[01:49:02.658 --> 01:49:07.705]  Again, you would say that doesn't make sense when you understand that the system wants you dead.
[01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:15.993]  When you understand that this is a global eugenics program of population control on planet Earth, then it makes sense.
[01:49:15.993 --> 01:49:20.194]  Until you accept that reality, none of this will make sense.
[01:49:20.194 --> 01:49:25.575]  But as soon as you have that realization, everything you're seeing makes all the sense in the world.
[01:49:25.575 --> 01:49:27.155]  These people don't want to help you.
[01:49:27.155 --> 01:49:31.976]  They want you dead.
[01:49:31.976 --> 01:49:34.117]  So it's time for more whistleblowers to come forward.
[01:49:34.117 --> 01:49:37.938]  It's time for whistleblowers to come forward out of the DC police and say, hey, you know what?
[01:49:38.891 --> 01:49:40.652]  We were told to stand down.
[01:49:40.652 --> 01:49:44.053]  The police that they put on Capitol Hill were the ones running it.
[01:49:44.053 --> 01:49:48.616]  Mario Bowser told us not to have more security.
[01:49:48.616 --> 01:49:49.916]  I'm an officer in the D.C.
[01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:53.978]  police and I know that all this went on.
[01:49:53.978 --> 01:50:00.221]  You need to have other doctors come forward and we've had so many, but there just needs to be such a tidal wave that the media can't cover it up.
[01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:01.422]  Of doctors just like that.
[01:50:02.423 --> 01:50:12.005]  Saying I have to sit here, and I have to watch COVID patients come in and out of these clinics, in and out of these hospitals, and we're not even allowed to help them.
[01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:19.767]  We're told to just let them die, or put them on a ventilator to murder them quicker.
[01:50:19.767 --> 01:50:31.830]  And I don't know if that is an inevitability, but that is one of the ways that we can finally maybe get out of this tyranny, is just mass numbers of whistleblowers.
[01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:47.481]  Let's go to this clip real quick of Representative Andy Biggs who is one of the great members of the Republican Party and setting the example for the rest of people.
[01:50:47.481 --> 01:50:56.711]  Here he is during a short press conference the other day talking about and accusing Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney of being spies for the Democrat Party.
[01:50:59.002 --> 01:51:02.164]  With that, we've got time for maybe two questions.
[01:51:02.164 --> 01:51:14.030]  Congressman, you committed to putting against the Republican Party, the Big Tent Party, so isn't it wanting to kick out your colleagues from your party, complete opposite of that?
[01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:15.751]  Here's the deal.
[01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:22.814]  A long time ago, Liz Cheney decided that she was going to take on the entire Republican Conference.
[01:51:22.814 --> 01:51:25.316]  And she was joined by Adam Kinzinger.
[01:51:25.316 --> 01:51:27.017]  They chose to leave the conference.
[01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:29.450]  Let me ask you this.
[01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:39.257]  Would you like it if you're planning a strategy on how to defeat people who you think are actually tearing the country from stem to stern?
[01:51:39.257 --> 01:51:43.801]  If you had two spies sitting right there, you knew there were spies, but you couldn't remove them.
[01:51:43.801 --> 01:51:52.607]  Right now, as long as they're members of the Republican Conference, they're entitled to come to every meeting we have, hear every strategy, and you know what?
[01:51:52.607 --> 01:51:53.528]  They chose to leave.
[01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:56.496]  The big tent's still there.
[01:51:56.496 --> 01:51:59.680]  They just have chosen to be on the outside of that big tent.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.721]  So there you go.
[01:52:00.721 --> 01:52:02.603]  Andy Biggs calling it like it is.
[01:52:02.603 --> 01:52:06.487]  And Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney are spies for the Democrat Party.
[01:52:06.487 --> 01:52:09.291]  Alex Jones joins us on the phone line shortly for the remainder of this segment.
[01:52:09.291 --> 01:52:10.292]  He'll be back in the next hour.
[01:52:10.292 --> 01:52:13.676]  Alex, so much developing right now.
[01:52:13.676 --> 01:52:14.657]  It seems every day.
[01:52:15.572 --> 01:52:16.393]  Well, that's right.
[01:52:16.393 --> 01:52:24.698]  And again, they have asked me to host the fourth hour today, so I just wanted to announce to listeners that I will be hosting the fourth hour today ahead of the quorum, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:52:24.698 --> 01:52:30.282]  So I will be hosting the third, fourth hour of my show today, so everyone knows.
[01:52:30.282 --> 01:52:34.685]  I'll be focused on a bunch of clips and a lot of breaking news and information I'm going to have for folks.
[01:52:34.685 --> 01:52:36.806]  It'll be a very important fourth hour.
[01:52:36.806 --> 01:52:43.791]  Separately, Michael Rappaport, the weird movie TV character,
[01:52:44.912 --> 01:52:46.752]  He was always attacking us.
[01:52:46.752 --> 01:52:49.113]  He came out and said, I took the vaccine, I'm a superhero.
[01:52:49.113 --> 01:52:51.353]  Why are you telling me I'm a super spreader?
[01:52:51.353 --> 01:52:56.575]  We offered him $100,000 of his charity to come here and let us deprogram him and show him all the documents.
[01:52:56.575 --> 01:53:00.135]  He attacked us and called us a bunch of names last night, we've now learned.
[01:53:00.135 --> 01:53:03.636]  And so I'm going to be playing that in the fourth hour today.
[01:53:03.636 --> 01:53:06.357]  But I saw you mention Matt Gaetz come out and expose the FBI.
[01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:08.190]  I think so.
[01:53:33.086 --> 01:53:33.326]  I'm good.
[01:53:45.609 --> 01:53:49.290]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:58.792]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[01:53:58.792 --> 01:54:05.454]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[01:54:05.454 --> 01:54:09.015]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[01:54:09.015 --> 01:54:11.435]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:54:11.435 --> 01:54:14.316]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:54:14.636 --> 01:54:16.718]  But only for one more week.
[01:54:16.718 --> 01:54:19.200]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.221]  But that's it.
[01:54:20.221 --> 01:54:22.624]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[01:54:22.624 --> 01:54:24.826]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[01:54:24.826 --> 01:54:26.828]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:54:26.828 --> 01:54:28.109]  It's the highest quality.
[01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:29.270]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:30.972]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[01:54:30.972 --> 01:54:34.495]  All ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:54:37.398 --> 01:54:47.784]  Again, InfoWarsTore.com, 10% off on high-quality, durable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can.
[01:54:47.784 --> 01:54:58.131]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[01:54:58.131 --> 01:55:06.096]  Even more, the general public, they do the same things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:08.090]  Well guess what?
[01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:22.077]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[01:55:23.277 --> 01:55:28.778]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[01:55:28.778 --> 01:55:35.140]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:44.442]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[01:55:44.442 --> 01:55:45.502]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:49.722 --> 01:55:52.363]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:13.246 --> 01:56:16.955]  I want to read this statement from Greg Abbott.
[01:56:24.232 --> 01:56:25.232]  I think I'll have time to do it.
[01:56:25.232 --> 01:56:29.413]  Let me just pre-text, pre-preface this with a couple headlines.
[01:56:29.413 --> 01:56:34.954]  Biden administration warns Texas Governor Greg Abbott to undo dangerous and unlawful executive order.
[01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:37.275]  I mean, talk about projection.
[01:56:37.275 --> 01:56:39.395]  They have a wide open southern border.
[01:56:39.395 --> 01:56:43.136]  Rapists, murderers, just the worst kind of people pouring over.
[01:56:43.136 --> 01:56:46.357]  They're bringing over disease and deadly drugs and guns and everything.
[01:56:47.674 --> 01:56:51.036]  But the Biden administration says, oh, it's dangerous and unlawful to close the border.
[01:56:51.036 --> 01:56:53.617]  I mean, that is so insane.
[01:56:53.617 --> 01:56:59.620]  Merrick Garland needs to be committed to a psych ward and put in a rubber room and harnessed immediately.
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.361]  I mean, that's just a joke.
[01:57:01.361 --> 01:57:06.864]  Department of Justice threatens to sue Texas over its steps to stop illegal aliens from spreading disease.
[01:57:06.864 --> 01:57:09.886]  So again, the Biden administration is criminal on its face.
[01:57:09.886 --> 01:57:12.467]  Merrick Garland needs to be arrested for treason.
[01:57:12.467 --> 01:57:15.729]  Here is Governor Abbott's response today.
[01:57:17.614 --> 01:57:23.115]  It is clear that the Biden administration fundamentally misunderstands what is truly happening at the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:57:23.115 --> 01:57:25.416]  Well, that's not true, but okay.
[01:57:25.416 --> 01:57:26.436]  They know what they're doing.
[01:57:26.436 --> 01:57:39.620]  The current crisis at our southern border, including the overcrowding of immigration facilities and the devastating spread of COVID-19 that the influx of non-citizens is causing, is entirely the creation of the Biden administration and its failed immigration policies.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:53.889]  By choosing not to enforce immigration laws, removing sound policies like the Remain in Mexico program, and failing to make the most robust use of Title 42 authorities, the administration has directly caused the unprecedented crisis Texas is facing.
[01:57:53.889 --> 01:58:02.515]  And it is increasingly a matter of grave public health concern as unlawful migrants enter from countries with lower vaccination rates than the United States.
[01:58:02.515 --> 01:58:05.137]  And then they actually refuse to get vaccinated too.
[01:58:05.137 --> 01:58:06.238]  Which is their right, I don't blame them.
[01:58:07.003 --> 01:58:27.282]  It would be of some solace if the federal government were conducting appropriate COVID-19 testing and other mitigation strategies, but to the contrary, we hear too many reports of the federal government recklessly failing to do so and instead admitting into the United States and Texas migrants from over 150 countries, many of whom are testing positive for COVID-19.
[01:58:28.996 --> 01:58:36.519]  In short, the Biden administration is jeopardizing the health and safety of Texans on a daily basis by refusing to follow the law.
[01:58:36.519 --> 01:58:38.020]  And it's not just Texans.
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:46.003]  These irresponsible policies and actions by the Biden administration are endangering the lives of many Americans as well as the unlawful immigrants themselves.
[01:58:46.003 --> 01:58:52.406]  I will take every available step consistent with the law to fulfill my duty to protect the health and safety of all Texans.
[01:58:53.766 --> 01:58:56.248]  We'll see how far Governor Abbott actually goes with this.
[01:58:56.248 --> 01:59:04.693]  He announced a policy that was supposed to start today that the Texas government was going to be arresting illegal immigrants coming across the southern border.
[01:59:04.693 --> 01:59:08.795]  So the Biden administration official policy is that the border is open.
[01:59:08.795 --> 01:59:20.623]  The Biden administration official policy is that Border Patrol, if and when they make apprehensions, they're supposed to complete the illegal immigration process and bring them into the United States, and then the Democrats have set up the infrastructure
[01:59:21.718 --> 01:59:22.078]  I don't know.
[01:59:41.161 --> 01:59:50.848]  We're going to be having our new reporter coming on air here today, I think, I don't know, everything's just kind of, you never know what's going to happen here, who's been down at the border exposing this again.
[01:59:50.848 --> 01:59:54.190]  So, but what is the answer to this?
[01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:58.413]  The answer to this is for Republicans to get more hardcore and actually
[01:59:59.568 --> 02:00:01.329]  Execute the plans they're talking about.
[02:00:01.329 --> 02:00:13.914]  So yeah, we should be in Texas deciding we have a southern border, we're going to close the border here, we're going to arrest illegal immigrants, and whatever happens with Border Patrol, we'll just have to face that when we get to that point.
[02:00:13.914 --> 02:00:17.976]  But Merrick Garland needs to be arrested.
[02:00:19.471 --> 02:00:23.015]  And so this is what Republicans need to do, and maybe they're getting close to doing it.
[02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:29.862]  We saw Texas Republicans saying the sergeant at arms has the right to arrest the Texas Democrats that fled the state.
[02:00:29.862 --> 02:00:31.223]  That's a nice start.
[02:00:31.223 --> 02:00:34.607]  Greg Abbott saying we're going to arrest illegal immigrants coming across the southern border.
[02:00:34.607 --> 02:00:35.808]  We're not going to have an open border.
[02:00:35.808 --> 02:00:36.829]  That's a good start.
[02:00:36.829 --> 02:00:38.270]  But let's get real hardcore.
[02:00:39.011 --> 02:00:52.549]  Let's get real hardcore and let's say it's time to arrest Merrick Garland and it's time to arrest Joe Biden for committing the treason of having a wide open southern border and treating illegal immigrants with more rights than Americans have.
[02:00:52.549 --> 02:00:53.671]  Let's call for their arrest!
[02:00:54.929 --> 02:01:00.515]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:01:00.515 --> 02:01:08.504]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:01:08.504 --> 02:01:10.826]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:01:10.826 --> 02:01:14.410]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[02:01:16.312 --> 02:01:24.496]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[02:01:24.496 --> 02:01:30.399]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[02:01:30.399 --> 02:01:41.125]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[02:01:41.125 --> 02:01:42.406]  Thank you and God bless.
[02:01:43.166 --> 02:02:00.978]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[02:02:00.978 --> 02:02:05.220]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:07.122]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:02:09.503 --> 02:02:13.085]  Here's a great statement from Ted Cruz.
[02:02:13.085 --> 02:02:14.305]  Exactly.
[02:02:38.755 --> 02:02:46.241]  And again, it's just like President Trump said, he's like, you know, I knew it was bad, but I got into the White House and I didn't realize it was this bad.
[02:02:46.241 --> 02:02:59.892]  Because you assume that, hey, you know what, people aren't perfect and people have different political ideologies and different means to end goals and, you know, but you get into DC, you get involved in politics and you have a good, you have a good heart and you have a good mind and you, you,
[02:03:00.532 --> 02:03:02.353]  You have a good soul and you just want to help people?
[02:03:02.353 --> 02:03:03.674]  Doesn't mean you're going to do everything right.
[02:03:03.674 --> 02:03:05.315]  Doesn't mean you're going to get along with everybody.
[02:03:05.315 --> 02:03:06.296]  Doesn't mean everyone's going to agree.
[02:03:06.296 --> 02:03:11.279]  But you know, you're in it for the right reasons and you figure, hey, you know, I'm trying to help people here.
[02:03:11.279 --> 02:03:13.940]  Why would I be getting this resistance?
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.523]  And that's when Trump realizes, oh, this isn't, I'm not, these aren't politicians.
[02:03:18.523 --> 02:03:19.524]  We're not doing politics.
[02:03:19.524 --> 02:03:22.165]  This is just straight up evil.
[02:03:22.165 --> 02:03:25.868]  That's why he said the media was the enemy of the people, because they are.
[02:03:26.772 --> 02:03:32.337]  The media wants to lie to you 24-7, whether it's about Trump, whether it's about COVID, whether it's about George Floyd.
[02:03:32.337 --> 02:03:32.937]  It doesn't matter.
[02:03:32.937 --> 02:03:35.380]  Their agenda is to lie to you.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:37.061]  That's the enemy of the people.
[02:03:37.061 --> 02:03:37.962]  That's the mainstream media.
[02:03:37.962 --> 02:03:40.884]  That's the Democrat Party.
[02:03:40.884 --> 02:03:45.789]  So now it is Ted Cruz who is understanding it.
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.901]  Folks, we're not dealing, this isn't politics as usual.
[02:03:49.901 --> 02:03:53.343]  This isn't your grandfather's Democrat party.
[02:03:53.343 --> 02:03:55.784]  This is the party of Satan.
[02:03:55.784 --> 02:04:06.409]  These are Satan's minions coming crashing down on our country like a meteor shower.
[02:04:06.409 --> 02:04:14.613]  Oh my gosh, and now Biden is literally drooling all over his chin during a wildfire briefing.
[02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:15.414]  My God.
[02:04:17.099 --> 02:04:20.388]  I mean folks, this guy... Sheesh.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:26.181]  We're already in a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:26.181 --> 02:04:28.802]  In case you haven't noticed, it's a cold civil war.
[02:04:28.802 --> 02:04:32.743]  Even though Democrats have murdered multiple people.
[02:04:32.743 --> 02:04:34.364]  Democrats murdered people in Portland.
[02:04:34.364 --> 02:04:35.885]  Democrats murdered people in Denver.
[02:04:35.885 --> 02:04:38.346]  Democrats murdered people in Washington, D.C.
[02:04:38.346 --> 02:04:39.286]  on January 6th.
[02:04:39.286 --> 02:04:41.187]  So the Democrats have taken it hot.
[02:04:41.187 --> 02:04:42.487]  They've murdered a bunch of people.
[02:04:42.487 --> 02:04:44.068]  They've arrested a bunch of people.
[02:04:44.068 --> 02:04:46.789]  So for the Democrats, they're in a hot civil war right now.
[02:04:46.789 --> 02:04:48.369]  They want to kill you.
[02:04:48.369 --> 02:04:49.950]  They want to enslave you.
[02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:50.890]  They want to imprison you.
[02:04:50.890 --> 02:04:51.631]  And they want to kill you.
[02:04:51.631 --> 02:04:52.251]  That's no joke.
[02:04:54.105 --> 02:04:56.747]  Ask Ashley Babbitt.
[02:04:56.747 --> 02:04:59.008]  Ask people rotting in jail for being in D.C.
[02:04:59.008 --> 02:04:59.768]  on January 6th.
[02:04:59.768 --> 02:05:02.790]  The Democrats are in a hot civil war right now.
[02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:08.393]  They're murdering people, they're enslaving people, they're torturing people, they're imprisoning people.
[02:05:08.393 --> 02:05:16.217]  So when are the Republicans finally going to respond to this with the necessary fervor?
[02:05:16.217 --> 02:05:21.000]  See, we're still in this cold civil war, informational warfare, narrative warfare,
[02:05:22.452 --> 02:05:29.855]  Where we're just trying to combat all their lies and just try to awaken the public about how dastardly they are.
[02:05:29.855 --> 02:05:31.956]  They're already out murdering people.
[02:05:31.956 --> 02:05:34.457]  They're already out bringing in political prisoners.
[02:05:34.457 --> 02:05:39.079]  They're not messing around.
[02:05:39.079 --> 02:05:42.280]  So... And I'll tell ya...
[02:05:44.353 --> 02:05:48.476]  2022, the midterm elections, which we already have started a countdown.
[02:05:48.476 --> 02:05:53.900]  I mean, I don't bother with it, but there's 466 days till the midterm elections.
[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:58.262]  And here's the thing.
[02:05:58.262 --> 02:06:04.687]  This is why the Democrats are in total panic right now about the election audit.
[02:06:04.687 --> 02:06:08.469]  This is why Merrick Garland is saying it's illegal for states to do election audits.
[02:06:08.469 --> 02:06:10.490]  It's just total BS.
[02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.891]  Because
[02:06:12.668 --> 02:06:22.725]  As soon as Americans realize that we haven't had a real election in this country for a long, long time, they're going to demand election reform ahead of the midterms.
[02:06:23.891 --> 02:06:25.612]  So that's why they're panicked over this audit.
[02:06:25.612 --> 02:06:28.233]  That's why they don't like all this information getting out.
[02:06:28.233 --> 02:06:37.017]  I mean, seriously, any serious person who's not a pathological liar and who's not intellectually dishonest with themselves knows that Biden did not win the 2020 election.
[02:06:37.017 --> 02:06:39.458]  Knows it was stolen.
[02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:51.264]  You know, as obvious as videos we see coming out of California where guys just walk into Walmarts and Targets and just load up grocery bags and load up trash bags and load up backpacks with stolen goods and just walk out the front door.
[02:06:52.708 --> 02:06:56.569]  Because the new Democrat policy is you just let people steal.
[02:06:56.569 --> 02:07:00.650]  And then all these businesses shut down, they go out of business because they can't do anything.
[02:07:00.650 --> 02:07:06.552]  All their merchandise gets robbed and they have no recourse.
[02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:14.755]  It was as obvious as the sun is in the sky on a cloudless day.
[02:07:14.755 --> 02:07:18.016]  And if we had a real midterm election in 2022,
[02:07:20.256 --> 02:07:34.264]  There's going to be Republicans that get into office that aren't there to mess around, not there to play politics, not there because there's an R behind their name, but they're there because they realize the enemies of America are in the halls of Congress.
[02:07:34.264 --> 02:07:40.448]  They're there because they realize the enemies of America are on the mainstream media, and they actually want to do something about it.
[02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:47.091]  Not just play patty cake, not just get into Congress and slap hands and hang out with Mitch McConnell.
[02:07:47.091 --> 02:07:55.573]  No, they want to get in there and actually save this country from damnation that the Democrats are bringing down on us.
[02:07:55.573 --> 02:08:03.655]  And so it's insulting that we have to deal with Joe Biden, who earlier this week runs up to the media gaggle and says that he's wiped his butt.
[02:08:04.545 --> 02:08:15.172]  It's embarrassing that we have to deal with a president who's about to have a press conference and he's so out of it, just probably bombed out on drugs, that he's drooling from his mouth down his chin.
[02:08:15.172 --> 02:08:19.354]  Drool dripping off of his chin as he's about to have a major press conference.
[02:08:19.354 --> 02:08:19.714]  Literally.
[02:08:19.714 --> 02:08:24.938]  I mean, we just showed you.
[02:08:24.938 --> 02:08:30.241]  And they have to send him a note telling him to wipe his chin because he's drooling.
[02:08:30.241 --> 02:08:31.742]  What are you going to do, put a bib on him next?
[02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:39.032]  Yeah, Joe Biden needs a bib to stop from drooling on national TV.
[02:08:39.032 --> 02:08:42.213]  Because he's not even there.
[02:08:42.213 --> 02:08:48.496]  Again, I keep going back to this, but the media still hasn't mentioned it at all.
[02:08:48.496 --> 02:08:58.019]  The Biden White House, or who knows who, we don't have any answers, somebody is ordering airstrikes in Somalia right now.
[02:08:58.019 --> 02:09:00.240]  Nobody knows who!
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.721]  Biden doesn't know what's going on.
[02:09:02.774 --> 02:09:07.035]  And even the Democrat Party didn't know it was going on.
[02:09:07.035 --> 02:09:10.996]  And they raised hell about it in Congress and they said, wait a second.
[02:09:10.996 --> 02:09:13.197]  We've been, we've been airstriking Somalia?
[02:09:13.197 --> 02:09:14.637]  There was no vote on this.
[02:09:14.637 --> 02:09:16.438]  There was no, nobody even brought it up.
[02:09:16.438 --> 02:09:19.639]  We just turn around, all of a sudden we're bombing Somalia.
[02:09:19.639 --> 02:09:21.719]  Who made that call?
[02:09:21.719 --> 02:09:25.280]  Who?
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.261]  See, that's how dangerous it is right now.
[02:09:28.311 --> 02:09:33.855]  That somehow our military is being ordered to bomb Somalia, and the orders aren't even coming from the White House!
[02:09:33.855 --> 02:09:38.238]  The orders aren't even coming from the President!
[02:09:38.238 --> 02:09:43.122]  Like, that is code red, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:43.122 --> 02:09:51.788]  I mean, that's almost beyond even all the COVID tyranny, almost beyond Joe Biden drooling from his chin during a live press conference.
[02:09:53.846 --> 02:10:00.530]  Our military is being ordered to do airstrikes in Somalia, and nobody even knows who's in charge.
[02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:03.071]  Nobody knows who's giving out the orders.
[02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:04.552]  Biden doesn't know what's going on.
[02:10:04.552 --> 02:10:07.073]  The Democrat Party doesn't know what's going on.
[02:10:07.073 --> 02:10:08.474]  Congress doesn't know what's going on.
[02:10:08.474 --> 02:10:10.114]  The American people don't know what's going on.
[02:10:10.114 --> 02:10:11.615]  The media doesn't know what's going on.
[02:10:11.615 --> 02:10:18.559]  Somebody is ordering our military, right now, under Biden's watch, to bomb Somalia, and nobody knows who.
[02:10:21.786 --> 02:10:24.366]  Biden hasn't made a comment.
[02:10:24.366 --> 02:10:26.447]  Who even knows where Kamala Harris is?
[02:10:26.447 --> 02:10:33.828]  Has anybody even seen or heard from Willie Brown's girlfriend in the last couple weeks?
[02:10:33.828 --> 02:10:37.449]  Seriously.
[02:10:37.449 --> 02:10:42.450]  So it's just totally out of control.
[02:10:42.450 --> 02:10:48.491]  And it's nice to see the Republicans fighting back against the mask mandates and there's all these different stories coming out about that.
[02:10:50.551 --> 02:10:58.407]  Liberal journalists in DC who hang out in Congress are like complaining that, you know, they see people in the hallways not wearing masks.
[02:10:58.407 --> 02:11:00.251]  Oh, they're just such good little slaves, aren't they?
[02:11:02.734 --> 02:11:16.339]  And, you know, I've got all these other news stories I need to cover, like food prices are about to reach new highs thanks to the inflation, thanks to the economic shutdown, all by design, all by design to drive America into poverty.
[02:11:16.339 --> 02:11:23.161]  So is it Lloyd Austin who wears a face shield and a mask running around in D.C.?
[02:11:23.161 --> 02:11:28.363]  Is it Lloyd Austin who's decided to take control of our military without telling anybody, without a vote, without nothing?
[02:11:29.929 --> 02:11:31.090]  Who's ordering the U.S.
[02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:33.131]  military to do airstrikes in Somalia?
[02:11:33.131 --> 02:11:35.413]  Who is it?
[02:11:35.413 --> 02:11:38.795]  And why haven't they been arrested?
[02:11:38.795 --> 02:11:47.621]  Because the Democrat Party's here, ladies and gentlemen, and they're here to seek to kill and to destroy the United States of America.
[02:11:47.621 --> 02:11:50.363]  And if they're not stopped, they might just be successful.
[02:11:54.042 --> 02:12:00.124]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.

[02:12:55.114 --> 02:12:57.975]  The biosecurity state is here.
[02:12:57.975 --> 02:13:03.896]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[02:13:03.896 --> 02:13:17.659]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[02:13:19.119 --> 02:13:22.320]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:26.321]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[02:13:26.321 --> 02:13:28.101]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:13:28.101 --> 02:13:30.782]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[02:13:30.782 --> 02:13:33.042]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[02:13:33.042 --> 02:13:35.903]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:13:35.903 --> 02:13:45.185]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[02:13:45.885 --> 02:13:47.289]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[02:13:47.289 --> 02:13:47.830]  They fight this.
[02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:49.313]  I don't know how long we can.
[02:13:49.313 --> 02:13:50.676]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[02:13:50.676 --> 02:13:52.300]  God bless and good luck.
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.823]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[02:13:54.773 --> 02:13:58.454]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:13:58.454 --> 02:14:07.956]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[02:14:07.956 --> 02:14:14.618]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 20-20 prices.
[02:14:14.618 --> 02:14:18.159]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[02:14:25.881 --> 02:14:28.343]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[02:14:28.343 --> 02:14:29.384]  But that's it.
[02:14:29.384 --> 02:14:31.786]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[02:14:31.786 --> 02:14:33.987]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[02:14:33.987 --> 02:14:35.969]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:14:35.969 --> 02:14:37.270]  It's the highest quality.
[02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:38.430]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:40.132]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[02:14:40.132 --> 02:14:43.634]  All ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:14:46.556 --> 02:14:57.622]  Again, Infowarsstore.com, 10% off on high-quality, storable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week, so take action now while you still can!
[02:14:57.622 --> 02:15:00.243]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:15:26.328 --> 02:15:34.558]  You know, I want to thank Cori Bush, who's a member of the Radical Democrat Jihad Squad.
[02:15:34.558 --> 02:15:37.761]  She put up this tweet.
[02:15:37.761 --> 02:15:42.447]  Is this the bipartisan infrastructure group or the audience at a Kid Rock concert?
[02:15:42.447 --> 02:15:45.030]  Hashtag negotiation so white.
[02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.350]  Yes!
[02:15:46.599 --> 02:15:49.362]  Race jokes are back, baby!
[02:15:49.362 --> 02:15:51.904]  Race jokes are back!
[02:15:51.904 --> 02:15:53.886]  And I thank Cori Bush for it.
[02:15:53.886 --> 02:15:56.349]  It's about time somebody brought race jokes back.
[02:15:56.349 --> 02:16:00.833]  You wouldn't think it was the quote-unquote anti-racist Democrat Party, who of course are the biggest racists of all.
[02:16:01.786 --> 02:16:09.429]  But there it is, so Cori Bush is bringing race jokes back and just doing it right on the old Twitter right there.
[02:16:09.429 --> 02:16:10.769]  You gotta love it.
[02:16:10.769 --> 02:16:12.050]  You got to love it.
[02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:18.612]  Cori Bush bringing race jokes back into the mainstream and I am here for it, absolutely.
[02:16:18.612 --> 02:16:20.953]  I think that's hilarious.
[02:16:20.953 --> 02:16:24.814]  The audience at a Kid Rock concert?
[02:16:24.814 --> 02:16:28.035]  I can get down with that, that's funny to me.
[02:16:28.035 --> 02:16:29.496]  But, you know, anyway.
[02:16:30.427 --> 02:16:32.287]  She's allowed to be racist, I suppose.
[02:16:32.287 --> 02:16:36.288]  Of course, she's an actual racist, but that's not the point.
[02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:39.989]  Alright.
[02:16:39.989 --> 02:16:49.731]  So, you have Republicans fighting back against Nancy Pelosi's mask mandate, which, by the way, she's already violated on multiple occasions.
[02:16:49.731 --> 02:16:53.352]  She's already violated her own mask mandate on multiple occasions.
[02:16:53.352 --> 02:16:58.193]  Why isn't Nancy Pelosi in jail?
[02:16:58.193 --> 02:16:59.933]  For being in violation of her own mask mandate.
[02:17:01.716 --> 02:17:28.855]  And then you have these Republican staffers, apparently, in one of the buildings, the Rayburn building, where Republicans have offices, apparently having a party in the hallway as an exhibition of their freedom, or as this liberal reporter says it,
[02:17:30.492 --> 02:17:41.321]  Hard to show the full scope because it's a tight space and there are a bunch of people, but it's about a hundred staff crammed together in a narrow hallway on the second floor, Rayburn, all unmasked.
[02:17:41.321 --> 02:17:43.023]  They're playing water pong.
[02:17:43.023 --> 02:17:44.824]  They even have cornhole.
[02:17:44.824 --> 02:17:47.707]  I think I smelled a cigar.
[02:17:47.707 --> 02:17:53.412]  A group of unmasked Republican staffers are playing beer pong in the halls of the Rayburn House Office building.
[02:17:53.412 --> 02:17:56.915]  Presumably their need to demonstrate the exercise of freedoms
[02:17:58.211 --> 02:18:02.754]  is stronger than their sense of responsibility to justify taxpayer-funded salaries.
[02:18:02.754 --> 02:18:04.595]  Oh, give me a break!
[02:18:04.595 --> 02:18:07.737]  Taxpayer-funded illegal immigration like the Democrats do?
[02:18:07.737 --> 02:18:10.478]  Taxpayer-funded abortion like the Democrats do?
[02:18:10.478 --> 02:18:14.901]  Taxpayer-funded trillions of dollars that the Democrats just steal?
[02:18:14.901 --> 02:18:21.665]  And I'm supposed to have a pity party about some Republican staffers playing games in the hallway to show you that they're free?
[02:18:24.328 --> 02:18:31.453]  Really, I'm neutral on the activity, but it's hilarious how it's triggering this liberal reporter, and I mean, he is really pissed, folks.
[02:18:31.453 --> 02:18:34.594]  I do not work in a fraternity house!
[02:18:34.594 --> 02:18:42.699]  I don't know why these people felt the need to do this here, but it is terrifying and horrifying that displays of decadent apathy.
[02:18:42.699 --> 02:18:47.923]  Oh my gosh, yeah, he is really upset about this.
[02:18:47.923 --> 02:18:49.724]  He doesn't work in a fraternity, guys.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:56.861]  He doesn't work in a fraternity, and this liberal loser doesn't like freedom.
[02:18:56.861 --> 02:19:01.262]  Aaron Frischner hates freedom.
[02:19:01.262 --> 02:19:04.303]  It's part of the prerequisites of being a Democrat these days.
[02:19:04.303 --> 02:19:11.785]  If there was a test, kind of like, you know, there's a test to become a citizen, there's a citizenship test, there's the test to become a Democrat.
[02:19:11.785 --> 02:19:13.345]  First question is, do you hate freedom?
[02:19:14.278 --> 02:19:18.881]  And if you answer yes, then you are allowed to be a Democrat.
[02:19:18.881 --> 02:19:21.003]  So you have to hate freedom.
[02:19:21.003 --> 02:19:26.907]  You have to hate individual liberties in order to be a Democrat or a liberal reporter in Washington, D.C.
[02:19:26.907 --> 02:19:31.049]  Imagine triggering the left with freedom.
[02:19:31.049 --> 02:19:34.191]  Triggering the Democrats with freedom.
[02:19:34.191 --> 02:19:36.633]  I think that tells you everything you need to know.
[02:19:36.633 --> 02:19:43.818]  And then you have all of these Republicans that met in the middle of the House floor, maskless.
[02:19:45.151 --> 02:19:48.353]  And Andy Biggs tweets out the picture.
[02:19:48.353 --> 02:19:50.835]  Today we sent a loud, cleared message to Pelosi.
[02:19:50.835 --> 02:19:55.879]  Her tyrannical rule is not welcomed in the people's house.
[02:19:55.879 --> 02:19:59.682]  And so again, it's good to see leaders stepping up from the Republican Party.
[02:19:59.682 --> 02:20:07.587]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louie Gohmert, Chip Roy, Lauren Boebert, Madison Cawthorn.
[02:20:07.587 --> 02:20:09.549]  And we're not going to agree with these people all the time.
[02:20:10.655 --> 02:20:13.316]  Andy Biggs and the like, Paul Gosar, the list goes on.
[02:20:13.316 --> 02:20:16.976]  But dammit, at least they're fighting for this country.
[02:20:16.976 --> 02:20:19.237]  At least they're in Congress fighting for this country.
[02:20:19.237 --> 02:20:35.040]  At least we have some members of the Republican Party that are starting to form a backbone and a spine, and their balls are starting to drop, and they're finally willing to stand up against the Democrat tyranny, against the Democrat hatred of America.
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:40.001]  And that's the best way to expose the Democrats for what they are to the average Americans who still don't get it.
[02:20:40.882 --> 02:20:47.565]  Just show them you want to live free and watch the liberals seethe.
[02:20:47.565 --> 02:20:52.467]  Just show the Democrats that you want to be free and watch the Democrats seethe.
[02:20:52.467 --> 02:20:56.409]  They hate your freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:56.409 --> 02:20:57.830]  They hate your freedom.
[02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:05.673]  And whether there's a big, deadly pandemic happening or not, that does not suspend our rights.
[02:21:05.673 --> 02:21:07.774]  Oh, there's Nancy Pelosi breaking her own rule.
[02:21:07.774 --> 02:21:08.795]  Straight to jail, please.
[02:21:09.881 --> 02:21:12.624]  Straight to jail for Pelosi, please.
[02:21:12.624 --> 02:21:17.169]  I want that woman arrested immediately and locked up and the key to be thrown away or lost.
[02:21:17.169 --> 02:21:23.715]  I mean, as if Biden drooling during his own press conference isn't enough.
[02:21:23.715 --> 02:21:25.878]  I mean, that's Nancy Pelosi half the time anyway.
[02:21:25.878 --> 02:21:27.880]  This woman's either so lit on alcohol
[02:21:29.312 --> 02:21:31.313]  I mean, I hope that she's that drunk.
[02:21:31.313 --> 02:21:34.195]  Otherwise, it's maybe even worse than we thought.
[02:21:34.195 --> 02:21:37.598]  Like, I hope Nancy Pelosi is a severe alcoholic.
[02:21:37.598 --> 02:21:41.580]  Otherwise, you know, her behavior is even more questionable.
[02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:44.022]  Like, oh, she's just wasted on vodka half the time.
[02:21:44.022 --> 02:21:45.823]  Oh, okay, that makes sense.
[02:21:45.823 --> 02:21:50.166]  She reeks like a damn brewery.
[02:21:50.166 --> 02:21:54.369]  That would actually be a bit of a good thing.
[02:21:54.369 --> 02:21:55.290]  Then it just makes sense.
[02:21:55.290 --> 02:21:56.551]  Oh, Pelosi's just drunk again.
[02:21:57.622 --> 02:22:01.205]  But no, she's a senile old bitch.
[02:22:01.205 --> 02:22:13.375]  Nancy Pelosi is a senile old bitch that hates you, hates America, hates this country, and needs to be removed from Congress immediately.
[02:22:13.375 --> 02:22:17.538]  That woman is a clear and present danger to this country.
[02:22:17.538 --> 02:22:21.942]  Nancy Pelosi is a clear and present danger to everything that we hold dear.
[02:22:25.595 --> 02:22:27.376]  How did Nancy Pelosi get all of her money?
[02:22:27.376 --> 02:22:39.920]  By the way, they just said, which is totally illegal, but they just said that they're going to release all of their, the Congress, Democrats in Congress just said, no, the IRS can release Donald Trump's tax returns.
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.280]  Okay, so what?
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.702]  Go ahead, release his tax returns, show us how much money he made or he lost.
[02:22:44.702 --> 02:22:45.542]  Nobody gives a damn.
[02:22:46.889 --> 02:22:50.171]  But see, it just shows you that they're totally unhinged at this point.
[02:22:50.171 --> 02:22:53.013]  I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi's tax returns.
[02:22:53.013 --> 02:23:06.983]  I'd like to know how Nancy Pelosi became worth hundreds of millions of dollars on her Senate salary, which is I think like $180,000 a year.
[02:23:06.983 --> 02:23:11.066]  Nancy, let's see your tax returns for the last 30 years.
[02:23:11.066 --> 02:23:12.687]  Or how long has she been in government?
[02:23:12.687 --> 02:23:13.607]  50 years?
[02:23:13.607 --> 02:23:15.669]  Let's see that old bag's tax returns.
[02:23:17.796 --> 02:23:23.140]  Let's see that demonic meatbag Nancy Pelosi's tax returns.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:24.300]  Wonder what that would look like.
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:27.803]  We know how Donald Trump made his money.
[02:23:27.803 --> 02:23:30.644]  We know what Donald Trump's been up to over the years.
[02:23:30.644 --> 02:23:32.226]  He's been a very public figure.
[02:23:32.226 --> 02:23:35.127]  Now, what about you, Nancy?
[02:23:35.127 --> 02:23:37.409]  I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi's tax returns.
[02:23:37.409 --> 02:23:39.490]  And for that matter, maybe Chuck Schumer's too.
[02:23:39.490 --> 02:23:40.791]  Maybe Dianne Feinstein's.
[02:23:40.791 --> 02:23:42.312]  Maybe Maxine Waters.
[02:23:42.312 --> 02:23:44.774]  Maybe it's time for the Democrats to get a little taste of their own medicine.
[02:23:46.235 --> 02:23:51.337]  Oh, you don't think there's financial crimes in every single one of the Democrats I mentioned that could probably put them in jail?
[02:23:51.337 --> 02:23:56.300]  Somebody do the investigation!
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:58.381]  Your voice counts.
[02:23:58.381 --> 02:24:03.443]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:24:03.443 --> 02:24:06.024]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:24:06.024 --> 02:24:07.525]  They know you're angry.
[02:24:07.525 --> 02:24:12.347]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:27:49.646 --> 02:27:51.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:06.141 --> 02:28:16.105]  Happening right now, we're seeing a violation of Governor Abbott's executive order that prohibits anyone other than law enforcement being able to transport migrants.
[02:28:16.105 --> 02:28:18.066]  Yesterday, we saw this happening.
[02:28:18.066 --> 02:28:21.107]  Many taxi drivers coming up, Uber drivers coming up.
[02:28:21.107 --> 02:28:31.492]  Well, today it's business as usual, even though Governor Abbott has just issued this executive order that prohibits anyone else besides law enforcement officers to transport migrants.
[02:28:32.092 --> 02:28:34.174]  Any undocumented immigrants.
[02:28:34.174 --> 02:28:37.036]  You can see behind me there's taxi vehicles over there.
[02:28:37.036 --> 02:28:41.840]  We caught some other Uber drivers continuing to pick up the undocumented immigrants.
[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:46.944]  This was all put in place because of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Texas.
[02:28:46.944 --> 02:28:56.912]  New COVID cases in Texas have spiked 178 percent over the last two weeks and hospitalizations have risen by more than 80 percent.
[02:28:56.912 --> 02:28:58.273]  That's according to the Daily Mail.
[02:28:58.633 --> 02:29:11.230]  I have a job to protect the safety and health of the people of the state of Texas, and that includes, especially now, preventing President Biden from importing COVID-19 into Texas as well as into the United States.
[02:29:11.772 --> 02:29:21.197]  Governor Abbott is also accusing the Biden administration of thwarting Title 42 that was put in place under the Trump administration.
[02:29:21.197 --> 02:29:31.043]  And what Title 42 allows for is border officials to turn migrants away at the border, regardless of asylum status, in order to curb these COVID-19 cases.
[02:29:32.164 --> 02:29:42.097]  So again, happening right now, a violation of Governor Abbott's executive order that only law enforcement officials are supposed to be transporting migrants.
[02:29:42.097 --> 02:29:45.902]  Reporting from Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, I'm Christy Lee.
[02:29:47.262 --> 02:29:49.805]  And Christy Lee is in studio with us now.
[02:29:49.805 --> 02:29:58.716]  She is the host of KLTV and we've also got her a channel on Band Out Video because her work is getting censored and so we're appreciative of her being in studio.
[02:29:58.716 --> 02:30:03.742]  You were just down at the southern border and it was right on the edges of Governor Abbott saying...
[02:30:04.563 --> 02:30:07.124]  We're going to try to take law enforcement into our own hands down here.
[02:30:07.124 --> 02:30:09.785]  It's obviously been, for the most part, lawless down there.
[02:30:09.785 --> 02:30:17.728]  You were covering the fact that the La Jolla Sheriff came out and said, well, we didn't know that they were putting illegal immigrants in hotels.
[02:30:17.728 --> 02:30:18.788]  So you were just down there.
[02:30:18.788 --> 02:30:19.948]  You spent a couple days down there.
[02:30:19.948 --> 02:30:22.009]  You were going, scoping out all the scenes.
[02:30:22.009 --> 02:30:24.370]  What do you want to report to the American people about what you saw down there?
[02:30:25.148 --> 02:30:31.652]  Well, I want to say that this is the very first time that I've been to the southern border, so it was a little bit shocking having seen it for the first time.
[02:30:31.652 --> 02:30:34.134]  And I do have conflicting emotions.
[02:30:34.134 --> 02:30:43.520]  It's hard as a mother to go to the outside of Catholic Charities and see the flood of people being taken in buses, dropped off there.
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:51.024]  You see so many women that are pregnant, so many babies and children, some only with a diaper on.
[02:30:51.024 --> 02:30:53.466]  So, of course, as a mother, it's hard to see that.
[02:30:54.246 --> 02:31:04.072]  And you want to help them, and you want to care for them, but you also see so many sketchy things, and I know you've been to the border as well, that just make you have an unsettled spirit.
[02:31:04.072 --> 02:31:14.278]  I mean, for example, there was a man with a shirt off, tattoos everywhere, and he was there, outside a cafeteria, saying he was there to make a pickup.
[02:31:14.278 --> 02:31:17.460]  And I'm thinking, again, as a mother, like, what is this guy?
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.800]  ...doing coming to pick up anyone.
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:20.641]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[02:31:20.641 --> 02:31:22.601]  I mean, the motherly instincts... This is from Minnesota.
[02:31:22.601 --> 02:31:25.962]  I'm like, why is a man from Minnesota coming to pick up any migrants?
[02:31:25.962 --> 02:31:27.422]  And he doesn't even have a shirt on.
[02:31:27.422 --> 02:31:30.163]  And like you said, it's the motherly instincts, but it goes both ways.
[02:31:30.163 --> 02:31:40.525]  I mean, you want to make sure that the children are taken care of and you see the pregnant mothers and everything, but then there's another aspect of it where it's like, you also have instincts to tell your kids, don't get in the car with a stranger.
[02:31:41.115 --> 02:31:44.057]  Right, and that's where the conflicting emotions come in.
[02:31:44.057 --> 02:31:49.121]  Because as a mother, I'm seeing this and you just want to like wrap these people up in your arms and take care of them.
[02:31:49.121 --> 02:31:58.649]  But at the same time, my other motherly instinct is telling me, you know, they're just dumping them out on the streets after they test positive for COVID.
[02:31:58.649 --> 02:32:01.891]  That's why they ended up at a Whataburger coughing, sneezing everywhere.
[02:32:01.891 --> 02:32:04.714]  So the people in that community are put at risk.
[02:32:05.274 --> 02:32:06.896]  No big deal is made out of that.
[02:32:06.896 --> 02:32:08.698]  We're barely hearing about that.
[02:32:08.698 --> 02:32:11.801]  Just mainstream has continued to disappoint me.
[02:32:11.801 --> 02:32:22.894]  You know that I came from mainstream news and I just don't understand being there at the border and having all of this new information come out and being the only one there looking around and no one else is covering it.
[02:32:23.442 --> 02:32:32.505]  Well, and that's part of the thing is they want to tug at our emotional heartstrings because nobody wants to be a jerk that says, hey, you know, screw those kids, screw those people.
[02:32:32.505 --> 02:32:36.266]  They can go back where they came from, even though there's an element of that.
[02:32:36.266 --> 02:32:40.287]  But, you know, they come here and they're told they're going to have everything taken care of.
[02:32:40.287 --> 02:32:46.908]  They're given these manila envelopes that have prepaid debit cards, airline tickets, bus tickets, everything.
[02:32:46.908 --> 02:32:48.269]  But sometimes they show up
[02:32:48.789 --> 02:32:56.396]  They get dropped off by Border Patrol in the middle of McAllen, and they don't even know what to do, and so they just end up wandering into a Whataburger.
[02:32:56.396 --> 02:32:56.877]  Exactly.
[02:32:56.877 --> 02:33:00.060]  I mean, and that's what we had confirmed by La Jolla Police.
[02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:09.149]  We saw that they found out that Catholic Charities had just booked up a bunch of hotels, put them in this area hotel, but then no tracking is being done after that.
[02:33:09.409 --> 02:33:10.971]  That's how they ended up in a Whataburger.
[02:33:10.971 --> 02:33:13.955]  It's just, you know, a hop, skip and a jump from that hotel.
[02:33:13.955 --> 02:33:15.417]  They were able to walk there.
[02:33:15.417 --> 02:33:22.786]  No one's monitoring the very people that they've tested positive for COVID-19, yet we're pushing out into the mainstream media.
[02:33:22.786 --> 02:33:26.430]  Oh, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and flipping out about over that boat.
[02:33:27.111 --> 02:33:32.454]  Why are we not talking about this crisis of thousands of people coming in?
[02:33:32.454 --> 02:33:48.122]  We have spiking cases of COVID-19 and it can be traced back to those testing positive that are coming in from outside our borders and just free to roam and getting picked up by random people from Minnesota saying I'm just here to do business.
[02:33:48.122 --> 02:33:53.685]  We just deserve answers and more transparency and that's what I'd like to see, transparency and accountability.
[02:33:54.096 --> 02:33:59.158]  So you were down there for a couple days kind of observing the scenes, doing your reports for KLTV.
[02:33:59.158 --> 02:34:02.279]  We have your channel featured at Bandot Video now as well.
[02:34:02.279 --> 02:34:04.420]  What do you think really stuck out to you?
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:05.621]  What did you notice?
[02:34:05.621 --> 02:34:07.041]  Like you said, some sketchy stuff.
[02:34:07.041 --> 02:34:10.903]  What stuck out at you just from observing the scenes down there on that hot corner?
[02:34:11.994 --> 02:34:14.795]  I think the biggest thing is what I said.
[02:34:14.795 --> 02:34:19.357]  Uber drivers and taxi drivers picking up migrants and taking them where?
[02:34:19.357 --> 02:34:24.780]  The one Uber driver I spoke with said, yeah, it's just a mess out here.
[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:29.222]  I come here every day and I was taking some to the Laredo Airport.
[02:34:29.222 --> 02:34:35.985]  They missed their flight and so then I had to take them to another airport, you know, and I was only able to talk to him momentarily because then
[02:34:36.505 --> 02:34:38.807]  The other volunteers come in.
[02:34:38.807 --> 02:34:40.689]  But where are they taking them?
[02:34:40.689 --> 02:34:42.551]  Why to so many airports?
[02:34:42.551 --> 02:34:51.819]  There's just so many unanswered questions and not enough of a spotlight is put on this as an issue.
[02:34:51.819 --> 02:34:52.740]  And why?
[02:34:53.305 --> 02:35:02.817]  Well, and when I was down there, I think for the four or five trips and multiple day trips that I went down there, I only saw another media crew once.
[02:35:02.817 --> 02:35:03.398]  One time.
[02:35:03.398 --> 02:35:06.041]  And that was just a guy with a tripod who was setting up to get some B-roll.
[02:35:06.041 --> 02:35:07.222]  He was there for maybe five minutes.
[02:35:07.222 --> 02:35:09.285]  I think he told us he was with French television.
[02:35:10.166 --> 02:35:12.048]  Well, now this should be a big story.
[02:35:12.048 --> 02:35:13.689]  There should be local news everywhere.
[02:35:13.689 --> 02:35:16.812]  Governor Abbott saying, hey, we're going to try to have our own law enforcement.
[02:35:16.812 --> 02:35:18.673]  We're going to stop this influx of illegal immigration.
[02:35:18.673 --> 02:35:23.858]  We're going to stop this, you know, groups of people testing positive from COVID from coming into the country.
[02:35:23.858 --> 02:35:28.061]  Did you see any other media while you were down there as that announcement was made?
[02:35:28.061 --> 02:35:35.087]  Like I said, that's what's so shocking about it is I didn't see anybody right on the corner there where we should be asking what's going on.
[02:35:36.849 --> 02:35:44.734]  The La Jolla Police Department is accusing you, Catholic Charities, of dumping COVID-19 positive people out into the community to put others at risk.
[02:35:44.734 --> 02:35:46.515]  What do you have to say about that?
[02:35:46.515 --> 02:35:50.158]  Why wouldn't any reporters be out there asking these same questions?
[02:35:50.158 --> 02:35:51.859]  Why isn't more attention put?
[02:35:51.859 --> 02:35:54.420]  But again, my heart goes out to the whole situation.
[02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:56.222]  It's conflicting emotions.
[02:35:56.222 --> 02:36:05.528]  I have compassion, but I can't help but when I'm looking at these buses of people being dropped off, just looking at everyone with some skepticism because it's like,
[02:36:06.248 --> 02:36:09.270]  Are those really that child's parents?
[02:36:09.270 --> 02:36:11.592]  I mean, we know this happens.
[02:36:11.592 --> 02:36:13.833]  It could be happening in plain sight.
[02:36:13.833 --> 02:36:16.175]  How do we get to the bottom of this problem?
[02:36:16.175 --> 02:36:17.876]  We know it occurs.
[02:36:17.876 --> 02:36:30.524]  Well, and imagine, too, if you were a criminal who wanted to smuggle children into the country for whatever reason, to put them in a sex trafficking operation or just using them as your get-into-the-country free card.
[02:36:30.524 --> 02:36:32.225]  We know that both of those things happen.
[02:36:32.225 --> 02:36:34.147]  Well, this is the perfect scenario to do it.
[02:36:34.807 --> 02:36:40.111]  If, even if 90%, 95% let's say that those are their actual mothers, what of the 5%?
[02:36:40.111 --> 02:36:43.754]  I think that's probably a low number to say that that could be the case.
[02:36:43.754 --> 02:36:49.198]  But wow, oh, I've got busloads and busloads of children and mothers coming in and guess what?
[02:36:49.198 --> 02:36:55.243]  I can easily sneak a child in with not a mother, sneak a child in with not the father, and nobody would ever know.
[02:36:55.243 --> 02:36:56.424]  We know what happens.
[02:36:56.424 --> 02:36:59.126]  It's probably happening right in front of our faces.
[02:36:59.126 --> 02:37:00.828]  But again, I'm just disappointed.
[02:37:01.786 --> 02:37:05.688]  Being there at Catholic Charities, you see all these volunteers.
[02:37:05.688 --> 02:37:09.731]  You want to assume that they have good motivations.
[02:37:09.731 --> 02:37:17.936]  Why don't they feel uncomfortable with a shirtless man, bunch of tattoos everywhere, there to pick up migrants coming all the way from Minnesota?
[02:37:17.936 --> 02:37:22.819]  I mean, are they asking more questions or are they just like, okay, here you go?
[02:37:22.819 --> 02:37:24.661]  That unsettles my spirit.
[02:37:24.661 --> 02:37:25.621]  I want to know more.
[02:37:25.621 --> 02:37:26.722]  I want to know what's happening.
[02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:33.975]  When we come back from this break, I want to ask you if there was any cooperation, because every time we go down there, they don't really like us much.
[02:37:33.975 --> 02:37:35.676]  They make sure nobody can see inside.
[02:37:35.676 --> 02:37:37.417]  They never want to answer questions.
[02:37:37.417 --> 02:37:41.680]  I mean, at one point, I was trying to be cordial with them and just be like, hey, can we get an interview?
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:43.502]  Can I talk to some of these people?
[02:37:43.502 --> 02:37:48.885]  And once they realize that, hey, you're reporting that they're running an illegal immigration pipeline, they shut you out.
[02:37:48.885 --> 02:37:50.126]  They block the doors.
[02:37:50.126 --> 02:37:51.967]  And so I want to ask if you had that same experience.
[02:37:51.967 --> 02:37:52.448]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:53.493 --> 02:38:01.997]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:01.997 --> 02:38:12.123]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:15.507]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[02:38:15.507 --> 02:38:16.688]  Listen to this.
[02:38:16.688 --> 02:38:17.950]  Organic pea fiber.
[02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:19.391]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[02:38:19.391 --> 02:38:20.833]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[02:38:20.833 --> 02:38:22.295]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[02:38:22.295 --> 02:38:23.716]  Organic kale leaf.
[02:38:23.716 --> 02:38:25.258]  Organic flax sprout.
[02:38:25.258 --> 02:38:26.860]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:30.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[02:38:30.324 --> 02:38:31.586]  Just one of these ingredients
[02:38:31.766 --> 02:38:34.128]  It can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[02:38:34.128 --> 02:38:38.892]  And we've packed it all in to fiber green caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:38.892 --> 02:38:42.475]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[02:38:42.475 --> 02:38:44.977]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[02:38:44.977 --> 02:38:47.739]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[02:38:47.739 --> 02:38:49.341]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:54.568 --> 02:39:01.332]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[02:39:01.332 --> 02:39:04.915]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[02:39:04.915 --> 02:39:08.437]  Even more than the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[02:39:08.437 --> 02:39:12.880]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[02:39:14.039 --> 02:39:14.859]  Well guess what?
[02:39:14.859 --> 02:39:28.866]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[02:39:30.066 --> 02:39:35.570]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:41.934]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[02:39:41.934 --> 02:39:50.380]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:52.302]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:54.841 --> 02:40:03.003]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:40:03.003 --> 02:40:11.784]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:40:11.784 --> 02:40:18.726]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:40:18.726 --> 02:40:21.346]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[02:40:54.087 --> 02:40:55.628]  We're good to go.

[02:42:10.216 --> 02:42:13.117]  Christy Lee from KLTV is with us.
[02:42:13.117 --> 02:42:18.779]  She decided she wanted to become an independent journalist because mainstream media holds back the truth.
[02:42:18.779 --> 02:42:22.661]  She's got a channel now at Band.Video and she's sitting in studio with me.
[02:42:22.661 --> 02:42:25.802]  And so we're talking to her about her trip down to the border.
[02:42:25.802 --> 02:42:27.043]  It was her first trip down there.
[02:42:27.043 --> 02:42:28.103]  Big news.
[02:42:28.103 --> 02:42:32.045]  Governor of Texas saying, hey, we're going to actually have law enforcement down there arresting illegal immigrants.
[02:42:32.045 --> 02:42:34.726]  So you'd think there'd be other media down there.
[02:42:35.646 --> 02:42:40.969]  Reporting on this, covering this, and it's not like this thing where a lot of other media places will be happy.
[02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:42.289]  Oh, we got the exclusive.
[02:42:42.289 --> 02:42:42.810]  I'm down there.
[02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:43.970]  Nobody else has this.
[02:42:43.970 --> 02:42:44.971]  No, no, no.
[02:42:44.971 --> 02:42:50.834]  Personally, I wish there were other people down there breaking this story wide open so that Christy Lee didn't have to bear all the burden.
[02:42:50.834 --> 02:42:52.235]  But you were down there.
[02:42:52.235 --> 02:42:54.496]  So talk about, you're an experienced journalist.
[02:42:54.496 --> 02:42:57.677]  You're trying to do investigative journalism down there.
[02:42:57.677 --> 02:43:00.259]  Did you get any cooperation from the Catholic Charities?
[02:43:00.259 --> 02:43:04.561]  Did you get any cooperation from whatever law enforcement was down there when you started asking questions?
[02:43:05.532 --> 02:43:06.473]  Yes and no.
[02:43:06.473 --> 02:43:10.878]  So I texted the Sergeant of the La Jolla Police Department.
[02:43:10.878 --> 02:43:13.441]  I never got a response back.
[02:43:13.441 --> 02:43:16.725]  I reached out to Judge Cortez.
[02:43:16.725 --> 02:43:18.206]  Didn't get a response back.
[02:43:18.206 --> 02:43:22.030]  Now, when I was out there, I did ask Sister Norma
[02:43:22.671 --> 02:43:23.192]  Hold on, a tour?
[02:43:23.192 --> 02:43:24.053]  What do you mean a tour?
[02:43:41.653 --> 02:43:42.494]  I really don't know.
[02:43:42.494 --> 02:43:44.575]  Who am I supposed to find that out from?
[02:43:44.575 --> 02:43:50.158]  It was a group of people that she was leading and showing the facilities to.
[02:43:50.158 --> 02:43:54.301]  It might have been extra volunteers perhaps.
[02:43:54.301 --> 02:43:56.762]  Or maybe people she wants for funding.
[02:43:56.762 --> 02:44:03.246]  But of course, she's going to go do a tour of the facility, but the journalist isn't allowed in.
[02:44:03.246 --> 02:44:04.807]  Can I join this group maybe?
[02:44:06.068 --> 02:44:12.596]  I mean, in good faith, I wanted to get a good, decent interview from the Executive Director of Catholic Charities.
[02:44:12.596 --> 02:44:17.562]  The reason I went independent in journalism is I felt like I wasn't getting to report both sides.
[02:44:17.562 --> 02:44:20.825]  So, of course, I want both sides, and I want to do it fairly.
[02:44:22.287 --> 02:44:27.289]  They, if I get a roadblock and they just simply won't talk to me, what am I supposed to do with that?
[02:44:27.289 --> 02:44:29.830]  But I had good faith that she was going to come out.
[02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:32.391]  We waited for two hours.
[02:44:32.391 --> 02:44:33.391]  She poked her head out again.
[02:44:33.391 --> 02:44:35.052]  She said she was going to come back.
[02:44:35.052 --> 02:44:36.413]  Never came back.
[02:44:36.413 --> 02:44:37.473]  Then it started raining.
[02:44:37.473 --> 02:44:39.854]  And so then I contacted her assistant.
[02:44:39.854 --> 02:44:41.475]  We had a Zoom interview set up.
[02:44:41.475 --> 02:44:43.776]  Then apparently a meeting came up.
[02:44:43.776 --> 02:44:46.817]  So, I mean, if she does still want to talk to me, I still want to talk to her.
[02:44:46.817 --> 02:44:49.438]  I still want to ask these questions and get this side.
[02:44:49.978 --> 02:44:57.230]  But again, going independent, it's just like you want to do both sides, but it's like you get a roadblock sometimes.
[02:44:58.877 --> 02:45:00.078]  I'm not sure.
[02:45:00.078 --> 02:45:05.603]  And you don't want to sit here and talk disparagingly about a sister, about a nun.
[02:45:05.603 --> 02:45:12.268]  When a sister says, yes, I'm coming back out and talking to you, you don't want to think she's lying.
[02:45:12.268 --> 02:45:13.129]  But what does that say?
[02:45:13.129 --> 02:45:23.838]  I mean, it's almost a kind of a very revealing thing that here's this sister, here's this nun running this illegal immigration facility, hiding from the media, and not even good for her word?
[02:45:23.838 --> 02:45:25.059]  Not even good for her word?
[02:45:25.059 --> 02:45:27.041]  I mean, that should be the easiest thing to be good on.
[02:45:28.177 --> 02:45:28.738]  You would hope.
[02:45:28.738 --> 02:45:31.462]  Again, I like to give the benefit of the doubt.
[02:45:31.462 --> 02:45:34.105]  Maybe something came up, but like, I waited out there for two hours.
[02:45:34.105 --> 02:45:39.653]  I mean, someone could have given me an update that she wasn't going to come back out and talk after all.
[02:45:39.653 --> 02:45:43.819]  But again, I mean, I would still love to talk to her if she gets around to it.
[02:45:45.069 --> 02:45:58.177]  So you were down there and I was actually, you know, because I was asking you of all the times I've been down there, it's just non-stop buses, non-stop cars, non-stop, the pipeline just continues to the airport, to the facility, to the, you know, it's just non-stop.
[02:45:58.177 --> 02:46:02.479]  And you're saying for the, for the two days you were down there, it basically, it just hasn't stopped.
[02:46:02.479 --> 02:46:05.241]  It just continues no matter, even with the executive order.
[02:46:05.481 --> 02:46:07.322]  It's overwhelming to see for the very first time.
[02:46:07.322 --> 02:46:16.846]  This was my first time out there and just to see busload after busload and lines going through and it's uncomfortably like leading cattle lines.
[02:46:16.846 --> 02:46:25.250]  And to see, again, as a mother, like babies in diapers and then just the skepticism of like, are they really with their families?
[02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:26.491]  Who is this person?
[02:46:26.491 --> 02:46:30.953]  Why is this person from Minnesota coming to pick up these kids?
[02:46:30.953 --> 02:46:32.774]  And it's just, it's icky.
[02:46:32.774 --> 02:46:33.354]  It feels icky.
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:36.241]  Well, I think that's your instincts, though.
[02:46:36.241 --> 02:46:37.002]  Icky!
[02:46:37.002 --> 02:46:39.504]  I mean, that's just an instinctual thing.
[02:46:39.504 --> 02:46:43.766]  You're sitting there for hours, and the pipeline just never stops.
[02:46:43.766 --> 02:46:58.577]  You know, I mean, this isn't a secret that illegal immigration is a hotbed for all kinds of criminal activity, whether it's smuggling humans, sex-trafficking humans, bringing in drugs, bringing in guns, and you're just watching it en masse happen right in front of you.
[02:46:58.577 --> 02:47:01.238]  And I think perhaps the most shocking element of this
[02:47:02.219 --> 02:47:04.661]  You're there, and this is just one facility.
[02:47:04.661 --> 02:47:11.527]  This is just one facility of dozens, if not hundreds, just like it, across the entire southern border.
[02:47:11.527 --> 02:47:19.575]  And I know that news came out today of another mayor in a different part of the city calling out Catholic Charities for doing the same thing in their area.
[02:47:19.575 --> 02:47:22.858]  I don't have that information right in front of me right now, but I'm sure we'll be reporting on that later.
[02:47:22.858 --> 02:47:24.559]  And it's so frustrating.
[02:47:24.559 --> 02:47:25.980]  This isn't just happening in one area.
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:27.422]  And it's so frustrating, too, because
[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:35.144]  You were talking about the Sheriff's Department in La Jolla and other police departments have basically now echoed the same thing where he says,
[02:47:58.660 --> 02:47:59.140]  We're good to go.
[02:48:24.722 --> 02:48:35.211]  And it's just like, wait a second, how can I be reporting that story months ago, and now here we are in mid-summer, and sheriff's departments are saying they had no idea it was going on.
[02:48:35.211 --> 02:48:36.793]  How is that even possible?
[02:48:36.793 --> 02:48:43.739]  I'm not sure, but you did mention something that we haven't talked about, is their ability to be here in the I-35.
[02:48:43.739 --> 02:48:48.583]  That's what the family said that was found in the Whataburger that had been coughing and sneezing when the
[02:48:48.883 --> 02:48:51.826]  Officer asked, you know, what they were doing, what was going on.
[02:48:51.826 --> 02:48:55.150]  They admitted they were COVID positive, but that they had crossed the river.
[02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:57.953]  But they were here legally because they had an I-35.
[02:48:57.953 --> 02:49:02.378]  Now, the La Jolla sergeant says that allows them to be here for 60 days.
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.462]  But they need to report to the nearest ICE facility when they reach their destination.
[02:49:08.462 --> 02:49:10.202]  Whatever that means, exactly.
[02:49:10.202 --> 02:49:19.306]  But an access report I read says that of every one that actually reports within those 60 days, more than double do not.
[02:49:19.306 --> 02:49:21.947]  And so what's being done about that?
[02:49:21.947 --> 02:49:23.147]  What motivation do they have?
[02:49:23.147 --> 02:49:26.909]  I mean, of course, they're given the threat that they'll be sent back if they don't report.
[02:49:28.254 --> 02:49:33.976]  Well, and it used to be some of them would, they'd put the ankle monitor on them.
[02:49:33.976 --> 02:49:37.717]  Then they said, okay, we don't have enough ankle monitors, obviously.
[02:49:37.717 --> 02:49:44.619]  So then they were only putting the ankle monitors on violent criminals, you know, rapists or even murderers that would come across the southern border.
[02:49:44.619 --> 02:49:47.279]  Yeah, they'd be let in, but they'd put an ankle bracelet on them.
[02:49:47.279 --> 02:49:48.240]  Now they don't even do that.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:53.661]  Now if you can get across, and if you're lucky you test positive for COVID, because that's your release card.
[02:49:53.661 --> 02:49:55.261]  That means you're totally released.
[02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:56.042]  And it's just incredible.
[02:49:56.042 --> 02:49:56.482]  Again, folks,
[02:49:57.342 --> 02:50:00.125]  I don't know why nobody else wants to cover this big bombshell story.
[02:50:00.125 --> 02:50:02.587]  I don't know why anybody else isn't sending crews to the border.
[02:50:02.587 --> 02:50:04.308]  It's like the easiest thing ever.
[02:50:04.308 --> 02:50:09.013]  You stand on the street corner for an hour, two hours, and you'll see a thousand illegal immigrants coming in.
[02:50:09.013 --> 02:50:10.694]  You'll see the bus loads coming in.
[02:50:10.694 --> 02:50:12.936]  You'll see the Catholic Charities running the whole thing.
[02:50:12.936 --> 02:50:18.341]  They're now expanding their operation to like seven city blocks in downtown McAllen, Texas.
[02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:19.502]  It's just wild.
[02:50:19.502 --> 02:50:20.643]  So you've been reporting on that.
[02:50:20.643 --> 02:50:22.425]  I know you've been reporting on some other things right now.
[02:50:23.046 --> 02:50:26.034]  We just put your channel KLTV up on Banned.video.
[02:50:26.034 --> 02:50:27.217]  What else are you reporting on?
[02:50:27.217 --> 02:50:29.102]  What are you going to be reporting on in the near future?
[02:50:30.458 --> 02:50:36.082]  Basically, I'm just letting Jesus lead me to what he wants me to report about.
[02:50:36.082 --> 02:50:42.826]  I am going through this growth period, I guess you could say, because I've been in mainstream news for so long.
[02:50:42.826 --> 02:50:49.850]  20 years total, about 15 years in TV news, and then half that as a main evening news anchor.
[02:50:49.850 --> 02:50:57.015]  So I'm trained to do things a certain way, and now I'm kind of having to leave that behind and find my voice and figure out
[02:50:57.455 --> 02:50:58.495]  Yeah, you've had a lot of experience.
[02:50:58.495 --> 02:51:02.617]  What would you say, just in general, is the state of news right now, the state of mainstream media right now?
[02:51:20.871 --> 02:51:21.692]  I think it's dying.
[02:51:21.692 --> 02:51:26.195]  And I think that they're faced with the fact that they're dying.
[02:51:26.195 --> 02:51:31.179]  And so it becomes a process of where it just gets worse.
[02:51:31.179 --> 02:51:39.706]  Because as they're losing ad dollars, because they're becoming less relevant, well then they have to appease their advertisers even more.
[02:51:40.447 --> 02:51:47.971]  To get that money and so it just becomes this cycle of just getting worse and worse and it just can't go on forever.
[02:51:47.971 --> 02:51:56.456]  I feel like especially TV news is dying and people have other sources of information and they're going, people want the truth.
[02:51:56.456 --> 02:52:03.400]  They're going to seek it and find it and I think people's eyes are opening to that this news that you're seeing is so
[02:52:05.350 --> 02:52:13.055]  Influenced by advertisers and corporations that how can you is it a commercial or is it news?
[02:52:13.055 --> 02:52:18.879]  I mean that's what it ends up coming coming down to I mean it really comes down to is it propaganda or is it information?
[02:52:18.879 --> 02:52:25.063]  Do you get to decide what what the truth is do you get to evaluate the information you're given and what people are saying or
[02:52:26.704 --> 02:52:31.187]  Is it decided for you before you even get to evaluate it?
[02:52:31.187 --> 02:52:35.891]  Because news has deemed itself the authority of information.
[02:52:35.891 --> 02:52:36.591]  It's frustrating.
[02:52:36.591 --> 02:52:41.855]  Very well said, and that exact thing has been illustrated by Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[02:52:46.937 --> 02:52:48.199]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:52:48.199 --> 02:52:49.020]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:50.342]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:52:50.342 --> 02:52:50.903]  Good, Bob.
[02:52:50.903 --> 02:52:52.004]  Great last caller.
[02:52:52.004 --> 02:52:55.048]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:52:55.048 --> 02:53:00.756]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:53:00.756 --> 02:53:02.338]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[02:53:02.839 --> 02:53:04.540]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:05.480]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:05.840]  Go ahead.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:07.400]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:10.421]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:53:10.421 --> 02:53:12.082]  The X Team does wonders.
[02:53:12.082 --> 02:53:13.222]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:53:13.222 --> 02:53:14.403]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:53:14.403 --> 02:53:15.203]  Get off the fence.
[02:53:15.203 --> 02:53:16.083]  Get the product.
[02:53:16.083 --> 02:53:17.283]  Support the Infowar.
[02:53:17.283 --> 02:53:18.584]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:53:18.584 --> 02:53:19.244]  You're on the air.
[02:53:19.244 --> 02:53:19.784]  Thanks for holding.
[02:53:19.784 --> 02:53:20.144]  Go ahead.
[02:53:20.144 --> 02:53:21.865]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:53:21.865 --> 02:53:22.445]  It's an honor.
[02:53:22.605 --> 02:53:23.446]  Honor, talk to you.
[02:53:23.446 --> 02:53:24.567]  Awesome.
[02:53:24.567 --> 02:53:28.189]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product.
[02:53:28.189 --> 02:53:29.991]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:53:29.991 --> 02:53:32.733]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[02:53:32.733 --> 02:53:34.114]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[02:53:34.114 --> 02:53:35.835]  So, just number one for a few of the areas.
[02:53:35.835 --> 02:53:36.756]  Oh, it definitely works.
[02:53:36.756 --> 02:53:37.917]  It's not a joke.
[02:53:37.917 --> 02:53:38.817]  Absolutely.
[02:53:45.526 --> 02:53:48.389]  The biosecurity state is here.
[02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:54.314]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[02:53:54.314 --> 02:54:08.107]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[02:54:09.548 --> 02:54:12.749]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[02:54:12.749 --> 02:54:16.750]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:18.530]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:54:18.530 --> 02:54:20.631]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[02:54:20.631 --> 02:54:23.452]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:26.012]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:54:26.012 --> 02:54:35.595]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[02:54:36.235 --> 02:54:37.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:11.242]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[02:55:11.242 --> 02:55:13.203]  This is Christy Lee.
[02:55:13.203 --> 02:55:15.064]  I contributed a report.
[02:55:15.064 --> 02:55:25.810]  I have gone independent and you can find my stories on my website, but I have also shared them with Band.Video because the most important thing is the information can get out.
[02:55:25.810 --> 02:55:29.712]  Well, apparently we have Alex on the phone right now.
[02:55:29.712 --> 02:55:30.092]  All right.
[02:55:30.092 --> 02:55:31.573]  It's always fun.
[02:55:31.573 --> 02:55:34.174]  Christy Lee's reports can be found at Band.Video.
[02:55:35.435 --> 02:55:36.441]  Go ahead and roll the report, guys.
[02:55:38.530 --> 02:55:45.052]  Happening right now, Border Patrol continuing to drop off migrants here at Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.
[02:55:45.052 --> 02:55:46.992]  We're on the corner of 15th and Austin.
[02:55:46.992 --> 02:55:50.093]  We've been watching this happen all day long.
[02:55:50.093 --> 02:55:53.714]  They say that about a thousand are coming in a day.
[02:55:53.714 --> 02:55:58.656]  The executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, we saw her earlier.
[02:55:58.656 --> 02:56:00.176]  She said she would talk to us.
[02:56:00.176 --> 02:56:06.338]  She has yet to come back to us, but she has said in earlier reports that about a thousand migrants are being
[02:56:06.898 --> 02:56:08.541]  Dropped off a day.
[02:56:08.541 --> 02:56:11.485]  That was confirmed by another volunteer I spoke with.
[02:56:11.485 --> 02:56:12.807]  You said about how many are coming today?
[02:56:15.155 --> 02:56:16.957]  I think upwards to a thousand.
[02:56:16.957 --> 02:56:18.940]  Something like that from what I can see.
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:23.985]  So the question is, is what's happening to them once they get dropped off?
[02:56:23.985 --> 02:56:35.517]  The other question is, as she said in another report, that she had asked Border Patrol to stop dropping off migrants here because the capacity here at Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley is 1,200.
[02:56:37.259 --> 02:56:39.961]  Yet, 1,000 are being dropped off a day.
[02:56:39.961 --> 02:56:47.207]  So again, where are all of these mothers, pregnant women, families, where are they being taken after this?
[02:56:47.207 --> 02:56:49.049]  Do you know if they're all coming from the same countries?
[02:56:49.049 --> 02:56:50.150]  Are they all from Mexico?
[02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.650]  No, no, no.
[02:56:50.650 --> 02:56:51.131]  Of course not.
[02:56:51.131 --> 02:56:52.572]  They're from many centrals.
[02:56:52.572 --> 02:56:54.033]  Guatemala, Honduras, all over.
[02:56:54.053 --> 02:56:59.577]  There's a lack of transparency and also a shock as we watch this continue to happen.
[02:56:59.577 --> 02:57:04.160]  Busload after busload and I look around and there's no other media here.
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:15.428]  There's nobody else covering this and this is happening in light of the highest cases of COVID-19 in Hidalgo County according to Judge Cortez.
[02:57:15.428 --> 02:57:20.951]  We heard earlier from the Hoya Police in a post that went viral that
[02:57:21.912 --> 02:57:28.957]  They are confirming what's happening is those that have COVID-19 are being taken to a hotel.
[02:57:28.957 --> 02:57:35.282]  They're booking them in hotels, COVID-19, and they're just free to go anywhere after that.
[02:57:35.282 --> 02:57:37.764]  They see dozens of them outside of the hotel.
[02:57:38.504 --> 02:57:46.168]  COVID-19 positive, coughing, sneezing, no masks, and then they end up showing up in restaurants.
[02:57:46.168 --> 02:57:47.469]  There's no tracking being done.
[02:57:47.469 --> 02:58:06.219]  So while we are pummeled by mainstream news, which I used to be a part of with this narrative that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, are we unconcerned with the migrants that are coming in, many testing positive for COVID-19 over this building here where they're processed, and then not being tracked
[02:58:06.599 --> 02:58:10.641]  Going out into the community and we're seeing a spike in cases.
[02:58:10.641 --> 02:58:13.203]  Why are we not hearing this from mainstream news?
[02:58:13.203 --> 02:58:15.544]  Why are there no other reporters out here?
[02:58:15.544 --> 02:58:17.125]  These are the questions.
[02:58:17.125 --> 02:58:19.246]  Who is responsible?
[02:58:19.246 --> 02:58:22.288]  Let's take it back to the definition of criminal negligence.
[02:58:22.288 --> 02:58:27.511]  We know that criminal negligence is putting somebody at risk of injury or death.
[02:58:28.551 --> 02:58:37.734]  Well, what does it mean when no one is held responsible for those testing positive for COVID-19 just being able to go out into the community?
[02:58:37.734 --> 02:58:38.915]  They're at capacity here.
[02:58:38.915 --> 02:58:39.815]  They don't keep them here.
[02:58:39.815 --> 02:58:42.596]  They're just booking them into area hotels.
[02:58:42.596 --> 02:58:46.657]  And this is happening all across the border.
[02:58:46.657 --> 02:58:48.838]  We don't know how much this is happening.
[02:58:48.838 --> 02:58:51.739]  So who's responsible for this criminal negligence?
[02:58:51.739 --> 02:58:55.660]  That's the definition, putting others at risk or harm or death.
[02:58:57.481 --> 02:59:00.243]  No one's held responsible and we're not hearing it from anywhere else.
[02:59:00.243 --> 02:59:04.906]  We're just continued to be pummeled that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:59:04.906 --> 02:59:05.726]  We want answers.
[02:59:05.726 --> 02:59:11.770]  We're trying to get them for you, but we're having a hard time talking to anyone.
[02:59:11.770 --> 02:59:14.912]  You know, we heard from the Biden administration.
[02:59:14.912 --> 02:59:17.834]  We heard from Biden say he wanted a surge at the border.
[02:59:18.334 --> 02:59:23.381]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[02:59:23.381 --> 02:59:25.283]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[02:59:25.283 --> 02:59:26.284]  They deserve to be heard.
[02:59:26.284 --> 02:59:27.085]  That's who we are.
[02:59:27.085 --> 02:59:29.388]  Well, we are seeing it happen.
[02:59:29.388 --> 02:59:35.376]  We're seeing busloads and busloads of people coming in and they're testing positive for COVID-19 and then
[02:59:36.497 --> 02:59:39.378]  We don't know what's happening with them after that.
[02:59:39.378 --> 02:59:45.601]  I did talk to an Uber driver who says he comes here nearly every day to pick up some of these migrants and it's just a mess.
[02:59:45.601 --> 02:59:48.022]  In his own words, he says it's just a mess.
[02:59:48.022 --> 02:59:51.984]  He says that he takes them to the airport and the other day he took them to the...
[02:59:53.069 --> 02:59:59.136]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:59:59.136 --> 03:00:06.644]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:00:06.644 --> 03:00:08.946]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:00:08.946 --> 03:00:12.530]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[03:00:39.251 --> 03:00:40.451]  Thank you and God bless.

[03:01:12.082 --> 03:01:13.762]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:01:13.762 --> 03:01:15.423]  Well, so does he.
[03:01:15.423 --> 03:01:26.785]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:01:26.785 --> 03:01:28.386]  My friends, here we are.
[03:01:28.386 --> 03:01:30.966]  It's July 30th.
[03:01:30.966 --> 03:01:31.507]  The year is 2021.
[03:01:31.507 --> 03:01:33.187]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:01:33.849 --> 03:01:38.750]  Now sitting in here on the fourth hour ahead of the kickoff, War Room with Alex Royer, 3 p.m.
[03:01:38.750 --> 03:01:39.530]  Central Time.
[03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:41.871]  Remember this broadcast, you're not supposed to be on the air.
[03:01:41.871 --> 03:01:43.011]  The globalists want it shut down.
[03:01:43.011 --> 03:01:44.711]  They want it silenced.
[03:01:44.711 --> 03:01:53.933]  OK, we're going to cover the waterfront and a lot of clips we didn't get to in the last three hours of breaking news during this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:53.933 --> 03:01:57.834]  Next segment, we have not Biden saying he got his butt wiped today.
[03:01:57.834 --> 03:02:00.514]  That's already a week old.
[03:02:00.514 --> 03:02:03.535]  We have Biden being told he has a large yellow booger.
[03:02:04.361 --> 03:02:04.681]  I think so.
[03:02:35.307 --> 03:02:37.209]  They're not the criminal factions that are around him.
[03:02:37.209 --> 03:02:45.417]  So, Joe Biden, now, ladies and gentlemen, eating boogers on national television.
[03:02:45.417 --> 03:02:47.258]  That is coming up.
[03:02:47.258 --> 03:02:49.120]  This man is a pedophile.
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:50.682]  This man is a Chinese communist agent.
[03:02:50.682 --> 03:02:51.582]  This man is a liar.
[03:02:51.582 --> 03:02:53.524]  This man is not the president.
[03:02:53.524 --> 03:02:55.626]  This man is a fraud.
[03:02:55.626 --> 03:02:57.408]  And I have masses of articles here where
[03:02:58.706 --> 03:03:06.449]  All over the world they're trying to pass laws in Canada and Australia, and now the Democrats want them passed here where you can't criticize people or you get arrested.
[03:03:06.449 --> 03:03:08.710]  I mean, these people are just absolutely anti-free speech.
[03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:15.554]  But this, this story broke five or six days ago, and we did play it.
[03:03:15.554 --> 03:03:18.755]  I think it was on the Sunday Show last week.
[03:03:18.755 --> 03:03:21.916]  And I wanted to play this again because it's finally getting more attention.
[03:03:21.916 --> 03:03:25.358]  We've known for really a year and a half
[03:03:26.485 --> 03:03:36.771]  Because two years ago, the inventor of PCR tests already went public and said his test is being used for fraud because it's only an indicator test of whatever you're testing for.
[03:03:36.771 --> 03:03:42.855]  And if you turn it up too high, it will find anything you want, what you set it to, in the atmosphere.
[03:03:42.855 --> 03:03:53.162]  That's similar to a lot of the DNA tests they do, where, again, like a man took spit from his lizard, sent it in, and it came back as human, which, of course, it wasn't from 23andMe.
[03:03:54.608 --> 03:03:54.848]  I think?
[03:04:24.881 --> 03:04:33.268]  Not only is that fraudulent ridiculous because the mother didn't have it on a trace, but it's doubly fraudulent because it was a PCR test.
[03:04:33.268 --> 03:04:37.411]  So, they're still using PCR tests selectively whenever they want.
[03:04:37.411 --> 03:04:38.432]  Those nurses know now.
[03:04:38.432 --> 03:04:42.535]  They can just set it to 40 cycles, they're going to be 100% positive.
[03:04:42.535 --> 03:04:44.217]  And then you disappear by the contact tracer.
[03:04:44.217 --> 03:04:47.039]  So, think about all the forms of tyranny in the world.
[03:04:47.039 --> 03:04:49.381]  You never put up with the cops acting like this.
[03:04:49.381 --> 03:04:51.102]  You wouldn't put up with lawyers acting like this.
[03:04:51.102 --> 03:04:53.124]  You wouldn't put up with politicians doing this.
[03:04:53.124 --> 03:04:54.285]  But if it's the medical service,
[03:04:54.963 --> 03:04:57.684]  They've been conditioned to just bow down and accept it.
[03:04:57.684 --> 03:05:07.145]  So, the Rockefeller Foundation and others are on record studying how to take over and they said the medical system is our best shot at a world ID and authoritarian control.
[03:05:07.145 --> 03:05:09.686]  So just, I want to play this video again because I don't want this to be forgotten.
[03:05:09.686 --> 03:05:11.166]  I was on Paul Watson's Twitter.
[03:05:11.166 --> 03:05:19.968]  That's all he retweeted to Don Salazar's incredibly important article that we'll get to coming up that I hammered in the first hour where more than 20 nations
[03:05:21.963 --> 03:05:36.148]  That have the strongest forced COVID injections of 98% in Gibraltar, 90 plus percent in Iceland, 80 percent plus in Singapore.
[03:05:36.148 --> 03:05:38.329]  The list goes on and on.
[03:05:38.329 --> 03:05:43.170]  They have the highest COVID rates, the highest death rates, and it is the people that have been injected that are getting sick and dying.
[03:05:43.170 --> 03:05:46.331]  And without you can say 99% of those dying didn't have a shot all day.
[03:05:46.331 --> 03:05:48.232]  That's just totally pulled out of his rear end like everything else.
[03:05:48.989 --> 03:05:51.330]  Absolutely criminalized, but I won't poke at the data.
[03:05:51.330 --> 03:05:55.532]  They finally did a few days ago, and of course it was.
[03:05:55.532 --> 03:06:09.098]  All the data from the beginning of the COVID, so-called pandemic, a year and a half ago until the end of January this year, with only one month of inoculation in the United States, and they didn't count any people that had been inoculated to see if they had COVID, so they excluded those numbers.
[03:06:09.098 --> 03:06:11.399]  It's a total fraud.
[03:06:11.399 --> 03:06:15.301]  But Fauci thinks you're so stupid, and he's got all the corporate media lying for him, and he's pushing it.
[03:06:15.301 --> 03:06:16.301]  But back to where I was.
[03:06:16.301 --> 03:06:17.702]  Here is the video and the audio.
[03:06:17.702 --> 03:06:18.302]  We've had to bleep it.
[03:06:19.326 --> 03:06:27.913]  Of a woman who's just had her baby, and here come the nurses, and they're gonna jam a big Q-tip up the baby's nose to see if it has COVID.
[03:06:27.913 --> 03:06:30.054]  Absolutely asinine.
[03:06:30.054 --> 03:06:31.716]  Absolute bull.
[03:06:31.716 --> 03:06:35.359]  But remember, a lot of times they want to take children.
[03:06:35.359 --> 03:06:38.181]  They can just turn the PCR test up and take you away.
[03:06:38.181 --> 03:06:39.702]  It doesn't matter if it's fraudulent.
[03:06:39.702 --> 03:06:48.169]  It'd be like cops having a radar detector, and you know you're driving 50 in a 50, and the cop says, sorry, we're going 100, you're being arrested for reckless driving.
[03:06:48.169 --> 03:06:48.629]  And you're like,
[03:06:49.403 --> 03:06:50.183]  That's not science.
[03:06:50.183 --> 03:06:50.764]  That's a fraud.
[03:06:50.764 --> 03:06:52.664]  They just say, shut up.
[03:06:52.664 --> 03:06:53.985]  See, cops wouldn't get away with this.
[03:06:53.985 --> 03:06:55.745]  Cops wouldn't want to act like this.
[03:06:55.745 --> 03:06:56.706]  I don't lionize cops.
[03:06:56.706 --> 03:06:58.506]  They don't want to destroy their own country.
[03:06:58.506 --> 03:07:01.247]  These globalists do.
[03:07:01.247 --> 03:07:04.429]  And the good nurses and the good doctors are all being kicked out right now.
[03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:06.749]  So it's absolutely insane.
[03:07:06.749 --> 03:07:09.731]  Medical system is the best of times, the worst of times.
[03:07:09.731 --> 03:07:10.571]  A tale of two cities.
[03:07:11.963 --> 03:07:17.526]  Because it's great doctors and great nurses and great scientists, the majority of which are fighting this giant lie, but they're being silenced.
[03:07:17.526 --> 03:07:34.697]  So, this is big tech, big corporate, big pharma takeover, and to watch the left fawning at big pharma and fawning at the intelligence agencies that are killing our country and the world is really disgusting because they're... I mean, one thing, they were just evil, they were getting power out of this, but the left is all being disenfranchised as well as total delusion.
[03:07:34.697 --> 03:07:36.318]  So here is a little look at the future.
[03:07:36.318 --> 03:07:39.179]  Everything you see in the UK and Australia is what they want to bring here.
[03:07:39.179 --> 03:07:41.561]  The idiocy, the anti-science of testing a baby.
[03:07:42.495 --> 03:07:44.437]  With a fake test.
[03:07:44.437 --> 03:07:47.100]  When the woman, of course, started the testing, doesn't have COVID.
[03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:48.542]  This is all a giant fraud.
[03:07:48.542 --> 03:07:50.204]  Fraud stacked on fraud.
[03:07:50.204 --> 03:07:51.145]  Stacked on fraud.
[03:07:51.145 --> 03:07:51.865]  Stacked on tyranny.
[03:07:51.865 --> 03:07:52.186]  Here it is.
[03:07:53.652 --> 03:07:55.613]  Right or wrong?
[03:07:55.613 --> 03:07:56.874]  Because it is my property.
[03:07:56.874 --> 03:07:58.675]  So you will?
[03:07:58.675 --> 03:08:00.736]  While the baby's in your abdomen?
[03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:03.698]  So you're saying that once the baby comes out it's not my property no more?
[03:08:03.698 --> 03:08:06.379]  Yes it is, I gave birth to it, it's got my blood running through it.
[03:08:06.379 --> 03:08:08.640]  Okay Stacey, I'm just trying to explain to you.
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:09.861]  Well you're not helping me.
[03:08:09.861 --> 03:08:11.302]  You see what you're doing?
[03:08:11.302 --> 03:08:12.823]  Now you're stressing.
[03:08:12.823 --> 03:08:17.685]  I'm going to stop you now because I don't want to hear no more of it.
[03:08:17.685 --> 03:08:18.686]  This is my duty to you.
[03:08:22.728 --> 03:08:23.348]  I'm sick of hearing it.
[03:08:23.348 --> 03:08:24.928]  I don't need the stress.
[03:08:24.928 --> 03:08:26.509]  Once again, I'm looking stressed now.
[03:08:26.509 --> 03:08:27.069]  I haven't leaked all day.
[03:08:27.069 --> 03:08:27.629]  Now I'm leaking.
[03:08:27.629 --> 03:08:30.870]  Do you really think I need this bullshit about COVID when I've got a risk of losing my baby?
[03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:31.730]  Or possibly something else?
[03:08:31.730 --> 03:08:33.590]  You're more worried about the COVID than the baby.
[03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:34.230]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.770]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:35.610]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:35.610 --> 03:08:36.271]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:36.271 --> 03:08:36.751]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:36.751 --> 03:08:37.251]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:37.251 --> 03:08:37.711]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:37.711 --> 03:08:38.191]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:38.191 --> 03:08:38.651]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:38.651 --> 03:08:39.111]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:39.111 --> 03:08:39.751]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:39.751 --> 03:08:40.371]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:40.371 --> 03:08:40.911]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:40.911 --> 03:08:41.412]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:41.412 --> 03:08:41.932]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:41.932 --> 03:08:42.472]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:42.472 --> 03:08:43.152]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:43.152 --> 03:08:43.732]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:43.732 --> 03:08:44.512]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:44.512 --> 03:08:45.652]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:45.652 --> 03:08:46.172]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:46.172 --> 03:08:46.813]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:46.813 --> 03:08:47.373]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:47.373 --> 03:08:47.773]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:47.773 --> 03:08:48.513]  Can I have my stuff?
[03:08:48.513 --> 03:08:48.753]  Can I
[03:08:49.039 --> 03:08:50.540]  Are we signing ourselves out now, Stacy?
[03:08:50.540 --> 03:08:58.966]  Because then all COVID tests and my baby end up... So they're going to get security if we don't apply now.
[03:08:58.966 --> 03:08:59.607]  This is wicked.
[03:08:59.607 --> 03:09:01.008]  Do you know this is going viral, yeah?
[03:09:01.008 --> 03:09:01.648]  This is disgusting.
[03:09:01.648 --> 03:09:03.850]  I am sitting outside all day long, sir.
[03:09:03.850 --> 03:09:07.513]  I am not in your company because I know how you all feel, you know?
[03:09:07.513 --> 03:09:09.054]  I know you don't want me here, really.
[03:09:09.054 --> 03:09:15.679]  I know you don't want to have to do what you've got to do because of this stupid complying crap, but I'm sorry, when it comes to
[03:09:16.161 --> 03:09:18.282]  Care for a patient or something.
[03:09:18.282 --> 03:09:20.744]  You've got to understand and listen to what they're saying.
[03:09:20.744 --> 03:09:26.988]  You can't tell me that you get to give me the say of what happens once my baby's born.
[03:09:26.988 --> 03:09:27.789]  I don't think so.
[03:09:28.371 --> 03:09:29.752]  I don't think so.
[03:09:29.752 --> 03:09:32.893]  Do you know I even spoke to a police officer, people like that.
[03:09:32.893 --> 03:09:34.933]  You spoke to doctors and nurses and everything?
[03:09:34.933 --> 03:09:37.994]  I can do nothing to my baby without my permission.
[03:09:37.994 --> 03:09:40.015]  So can you, I'll stop you there.
[03:09:40.015 --> 03:09:40.535]  Alright.
[03:09:40.535 --> 03:09:41.116]  End of.
[03:09:41.116 --> 03:09:46.477]  So just so that I'm clear, this will be documented in your notes that we've got.
[03:09:46.477 --> 03:09:47.458]  Okay.
[03:09:47.458 --> 03:09:52.620]  This is now going to go viral to other nurses, other nurses and social services as well.
[03:09:54.180 --> 03:10:00.504]  This is all, this is all a giant evil power grab and notice all over the international news whether it's Chinese news or
[03:10:19.978 --> 03:10:20.318]  U.S.
[03:10:20.318 --> 03:10:22.901]  news or Canadian news or Mexican news.
[03:10:22.901 --> 03:10:23.681]  You see it everywhere.
[03:10:23.681 --> 03:10:26.103]  In Spanish, every other language.
[03:10:26.103 --> 03:10:27.584]  Babies are the super spreaders.
[03:10:27.584 --> 03:10:28.805]  Children are the spreaders.
[03:10:28.805 --> 03:10:30.707]  Because they won't take the shot.
[03:10:30.707 --> 03:10:35.130]  Now they're trying to give an illegal experimental shot to children and babies.
[03:10:35.130 --> 03:10:38.553]  And leftists are lining up to have their newborn babies tested on.
[03:10:38.553 --> 03:10:40.275]  Of course, some of which are dying.
[03:10:40.275 --> 03:10:42.396]  This is period.
[03:10:42.396 --> 03:10:42.917]  Next day weather.
[03:10:50.692 --> 03:10:56.755]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:10:56.755 --> 03:11:04.259]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:11:04.259 --> 03:11:06.560]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:10.142]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[03:11:12.063 --> 03:11:20.247]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[03:11:20.247 --> 03:11:26.150]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:36.876]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[03:11:36.876 --> 03:11:38.077]  Thank you and God bless.
[03:11:38.797 --> 03:11:46.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement edition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:11:59.259 --> 03:12:03.741]  I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[03:12:03.741 --> 03:12:09.343]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:12:09.343 --> 03:12:12.244]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[03:12:12.244 --> 03:12:13.424]  Listen to this.
[03:12:13.424 --> 03:12:23.588]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[03:12:23.588 --> 03:12:27.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[03:12:27.049 --> 03:12:28.290]  Just one of these ingredients
[03:12:28.490 --> 03:12:35.616]  That can be a life-changing supplement for your health, and we've packed it all in to fibergreen caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:35.616 --> 03:12:39.199]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[03:12:39.199 --> 03:12:45.885]  I suggest that you do the same thing, and right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[03:12:45.885 --> 03:12:53.211]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:53.211 --> 03:12:55.873]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:15.287 --> 03:13:17.668]  It's a fact.
[03:13:17.668 --> 03:13:33.035]  It's a reality of human experience in the history we recorded on this planet in the last 7,000 years of recorded history, that routinely evil, corrupt people that seek absolute power and control get control of absolutely every culture.
[03:13:33.035 --> 03:13:34.496]  It's happened everywhere in Africa.
[03:13:34.496 --> 03:13:35.636]  It's happened everywhere in Europe.
[03:13:35.636 --> 03:13:36.777]  It's happened everywhere in Asia.
[03:13:36.777 --> 03:13:41.279]  It's happened everywhere in Mesoamerica, that's Latin America today.
[03:13:41.279 --> 03:13:44.140]  But you'll have a big boom time in science and exploration.
[03:13:44.901 --> 03:13:52.525]  And people expanding, and as soon as the public becomes fat and dumb and happy, they become corrupt.
[03:13:52.525 --> 03:14:04.771]  And then it's always a priest class, uses superstition and mumbo-jumbo to start demanding offerings of the best houses, and the best temples, and the best castles, and the best food, and the best art.
[03:14:04.771 --> 03:14:10.534]  And then they start demanding the daughters, and they start demanding the sons of the general public, and they demand the noblemen.
[03:14:10.534 --> 03:14:13.876]  Then the priests start taking over the royalty, which again,
[03:14:14.733 --> 03:14:16.874]  Strongest warriors, the rest of it.
[03:14:16.874 --> 03:14:19.576]  And then they demand human sacrifice.
[03:14:19.576 --> 03:14:22.258]  And it didn't matter if it was the ancient Egyptians.
[03:14:22.258 --> 03:14:22.898]  It doesn't matter.
[03:14:22.898 --> 03:14:24.699]  You don't demand the firstborn of the Israelites.
[03:14:24.699 --> 03:14:26.120]  That's a historical fact.
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:28.121]  That's carved on the side of the pyramids.
[03:14:28.121 --> 03:14:28.822]  It doesn't matter.
[03:14:28.822 --> 03:14:32.564]  Every culture did this.
[03:14:32.564 --> 03:14:40.329]  Right where I am, or about to be gone, in Lake Tahoe, here in Nevada.
[03:14:41.428 --> 03:15:03.713]  Very near where I'm at, on the lake, is a big famous rock where archaeologists have gone down and found the bones of hundreds and hundreds of dead babies that the one particular native tribe, just like they would do throwing kids into volcanoes in Kona, the big island, also sacrificed kids in all the other Hawaiian islands.
[03:15:03.713 --> 03:15:06.073]  So that's Native Americans here in the United States.
[03:15:06.073 --> 03:15:07.293]  And what is Nevada today?
[03:15:07.293 --> 03:15:09.174]  We're on the border with California.
[03:15:09.174 --> 03:15:09.954]  And then that's going back
[03:15:10.689 --> 03:15:12.549]  To just a couple hundred years ago, the Hawaiians.
[03:15:12.549 --> 03:15:15.030]  And I'm not judging any of these people.
[03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:16.550]  The whites did it.
[03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:18.071]  The brown people did it.
[03:15:18.071 --> 03:15:20.171]  Everybody sacrificed humans.
[03:15:20.171 --> 03:15:23.352]  And so, I mean, I didn't even know that about Reno.
[03:15:23.352 --> 03:15:28.993]  I didn't even know that, that they'd throw them off this cliff into the water as a sacrifice.
[03:15:28.993 --> 03:15:31.373]  Oh, and when would they do it?
[03:15:31.373 --> 03:15:33.274]  When the crops didn't come in.
[03:15:33.274 --> 03:15:35.294]  When there wasn't enough game.
[03:15:35.294 --> 03:15:37.315]  They would say, we're bad.
[03:15:37.315 --> 03:15:38.495]  We have overweighed the earth.
[03:15:39.654 --> 03:15:41.095]  And we need to kill our children.
[03:15:41.095 --> 03:15:43.475]  The gods say kill our children.
[03:15:43.475 --> 03:15:48.917]  And that's the same thing that's been going on with Plato 2,000 years ago.
[03:15:48.917 --> 03:15:56.320]  He said, we're crushing Mother Earth's breasts.
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:16:01.902]  We just need to kill off all four people, period, and just get rid of the underclass.
[03:16:01.902 --> 03:16:04.143]  So see, that's the attitude everywhere.
[03:16:04.143 --> 03:16:06.364]  So when you see these deadly vaccines,
[03:16:07.117 --> 03:16:12.580]  They say they want to save you, but it's from the abortionists, it's from the eugenicists, it's from the depopulationists.
[03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:16.281]  Their body of work, the books they write, the things they do is about depopulation.
[03:16:16.281 --> 03:16:18.583]  But then they want you to take a shot because they love you so much.
[03:16:18.583 --> 03:16:21.424]  And that shot, of course, is linked to sterilization and death.
[03:16:21.424 --> 03:16:23.865]  So this is not even hidden.
[03:16:23.865 --> 03:16:26.386]  And I don't want you to feel good about a good tribal leader.
[03:16:26.386 --> 03:16:36.231]  So the same archetypal thing of our tribal leader being a president over the executive branch, not being strong, not standing up for us, not trying to get better trade deals like Trump did, but
[03:16:37.080 --> 03:16:43.944]  Actually working against us and being weak, walking up and talking about hitting his butt with boogers on TV.
[03:16:43.944 --> 03:16:45.565]  The video is now on InfoWars.com.
[03:16:45.565 --> 03:16:47.326]  A big booger right on his chin.
[03:16:47.326 --> 03:16:49.227]  He just deliciously enjoys it.
[03:16:49.227 --> 03:16:50.548]  This is the dementia.
[03:16:50.548 --> 03:16:57.812]  But they did this on purpose because the priest class wants to devalue all of our archetypes.
[03:16:57.812 --> 03:17:00.934]  And in the final equation, they always take down the king.
[03:17:00.934 --> 03:17:05.256]  And when they do that, they then finally plunge the society into complete collapse.
[03:17:05.256 --> 03:17:06.077]  So the priest class
[03:17:07.392 --> 03:17:08.033]  Did this everywhere.
[03:17:08.033 --> 03:17:10.354]  Everybody's always heard about the Vikings.
[03:17:10.354 --> 03:17:19.340]  And when a Viking king would die, they would usually take his wife and maybe even her daughters and tie them up to the boat with him and light them on fire.
[03:17:19.340 --> 03:17:34.091]  They found, just recently found, three years ago in southern England, a giant complex, a city of the dead, with the Celts, pre-Roman, and they found all the chariots with the different kings that would die buried
[03:17:34.722 --> 03:17:40.265]  And of course, next to them, their families, other than the sons, slaughtered, laying right next to them.
[03:17:40.265 --> 03:17:43.907]  So, this is some sick thing that develops over and over again.
[03:17:43.907 --> 03:17:46.088]  And it's happening again.
[03:17:46.088 --> 03:17:49.290]  It's in the sociology, it's in the anthropology, it's in the culture.
[03:17:49.290 --> 03:17:52.271]  And I'm just observing it with my own organic terms.
[03:17:52.271 --> 03:17:55.573]  You're not going to find a lot of this even in the literature, but the globalists know this.
[03:17:55.573 --> 03:18:02.977]  So, here is the footage, for TV viewers, and the audio for radio listeners, of Biden, the public president, talking about getting his butt wiped.
[03:18:03.795 --> 03:18:06.138]  We'll play it a few times because, you know, Snopes says it isn't true.
[03:18:06.138 --> 03:18:07.140]  Everybody saw it.
[03:18:07.140 --> 03:18:08.522]  The video's real.
[03:18:08.522 --> 03:18:10.484]  And then now he has resorted to eating boogers.
[03:18:10.484 --> 03:18:10.805]  Here it is.
[03:18:18.004 --> 03:18:22.307]  What must be what?
[03:18:22.307 --> 03:18:30.111]  And expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have, the federal and state government, along with local governments.
[03:18:30.111 --> 03:18:32.273]  This issue is ongoing.
[03:18:32.273 --> 03:18:34.694]  Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse.
[03:18:34.694 --> 03:18:36.955]  It affects real people.
[03:18:36.955 --> 03:18:46.201]  Everything from children who are breathing... And then again, he sees the thing on his chin and eats it when the aide tells him.
[03:18:47.156 --> 03:18:56.780]  So, he's a man totally disconnected from reality, and this is done so they can commit all these crimes and then later blame it on him, and he won't even remember what planet he's on if he's still alive.
[03:18:56.780 --> 03:18:58.420]  Now, this is a shorter segment.
[03:18:58.420 --> 03:19:04.302]  We've got a longer segment coming up, but I've just got to tell listeners something right now.
[03:19:04.302 --> 03:19:13.646]  We are in a knock-down drag-out with the New World Order, and they've launched their full attack, and they've got a bunch of big attacks that are going to follow a completely collapsed civilization.
[03:19:14.324 --> 03:19:17.505]  The only way we get out of this is being honest with ourselves and speaking up and taking action.
[03:19:17.505 --> 03:19:20.466]  But let me just tell you, they're not doing well.
[03:19:20.466 --> 03:19:24.047]  As bad as you think things are, their program is falling apart.
[03:19:24.047 --> 03:19:30.149]  Massive numbers of doctors and scientists are exposing the fraud of COVID and the inoculations, the PCR test.
[03:19:30.149 --> 03:19:32.330]  The wheels are coming off.
[03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:34.011]  And so they're really panicked.
[03:19:34.011 --> 03:19:34.651]  That's a good thing.
[03:19:34.651 --> 03:19:35.291]  We're fighting back.
[03:19:35.291 --> 03:19:37.232]  But I also get really concerned.
[03:19:37.232 --> 03:19:40.633]  Because that means that they got a bunch of other tricks up their sleeves.
[03:19:40.633 --> 03:19:41.934]  And there's no telling what they're going to pull next.
[03:19:41.934 --> 03:19:43.114]  They launched this whole COVID thing.
[03:19:44.551 --> 03:19:45.051]  I don't think so.
[03:20:15.089 --> 03:20:18.950]  Who will be leaders, and this is about souls, and this is going to be one hell of a contest.
[03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:22.370]  This is a giant battle of free will versus Satanism.
[03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:25.511]  And so, all I can tell you is I salute the listeners.
[03:20:25.511 --> 03:20:27.251]  Now you realize I'm not just saluting you for no reason.
[03:20:27.251 --> 03:20:28.432]  I make you feel good.
[03:20:28.432 --> 03:20:30.072]  You've been the incredible typical spirit.
[03:20:30.072 --> 03:20:35.673]  So I want you to look in the mirror today and just thank God for your family background or whatever you happen in your life.
[03:20:35.673 --> 03:20:38.674]  Whatever it is that God touches you to be awake and be involved.
[03:20:38.674 --> 03:20:41.934]  The fact out of billions of people, you're part of the millions.
[03:20:41.934 --> 03:20:44.555]  Care enough to tune into this show and put up with me.
[03:20:45.182 --> 03:20:49.563]  Because your spirit tells you, despite all my problems, this is the real deal.
[03:20:49.563 --> 03:20:51.563]  We're doing this together.
[03:20:51.563 --> 03:20:59.065]  And so to the crew, and everybody else, and all of our affiliates, and all of our listeners and sponsors, I just love you, and I appreciate you.
[03:20:59.065 --> 03:21:08.887]  And the great part is, as horrible as these globalists are, and as nasty as they are, and as depressing as it is to see how they get away with all this evil, I also get to meet all the best men and women in the world.
[03:21:09.397 --> 03:21:10.718]  We'll be right back with huge news, so stay with us.
[03:21:10.718 --> 03:21:12.359]  Please spread the word at fullwords.com.
[03:21:12.359 --> 03:21:12.839]  Tomorrow's news is
[03:21:37.034 --> 03:21:37.675]  It's 2 a.m.
[03:21:37.675 --> 03:21:39.176]  and the figure is gone.
[03:21:49.073 --> 03:21:56.617]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:21:56.617 --> 03:22:02.119]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:22:02.119 --> 03:22:09.703]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:22:10.003 --> 03:22:11.443]  Humanity is strong.
[03:22:11.443 --> 03:22:12.424]  We're incredible.
[03:22:12.424 --> 03:22:16.185]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:22:16.185 --> 03:22:18.666]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:22:18.666 --> 03:22:24.928]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:22:24.928 --> 03:22:34.331]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:22:34.651 --> 03:22:36.972]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:36.972 --> 03:22:39.614]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:22:39.614 --> 03:22:44.977]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazoobies, and others.
[03:22:44.977 --> 03:22:48.940]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[03:22:52.423 --> 03:22:57.926]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[03:22:57.926 --> 03:23:15.176]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[03:23:15.176 --> 03:23:18.798]  Worse than slaves, they're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[03:23:19.969 --> 03:23:27.513]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[03:23:27.513 --> 03:23:30.615]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world.
[03:23:30.615 --> 03:23:37.539]  We have to realize it's a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[03:23:37.539 --> 03:23:41.701]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[03:23:41.701 --> 03:23:43.902]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[03:23:43.902 --> 03:23:46.163]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[03:23:46.163 --> 03:23:47.484]  It is a spiritual battle.
[03:23:47.484 --> 03:23:49.145]  And M4 is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[03:23:50.236 --> 03:23:55.620]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[03:23:55.620 --> 03:24:05.367]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[03:24:05.367 --> 03:24:08.229]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:11.591]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[03:24:11.591 --> 03:24:12.792]  You've got red blood.
[03:24:12.792 --> 03:24:19.737]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[03:24:20.317 --> 03:24:23.259]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[03:24:23.259 --> 03:24:27.121]  And as crazy as your things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[03:24:27.121 --> 03:24:30.023]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[03:24:30.023 --> 03:24:34.906]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[03:24:34.906 --> 03:24:37.548]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[03:24:37.548 --> 03:24:41.950]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:46.053]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[03:24:46.053 --> 03:24:49.015]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[03:24:49.015 --> 03:24:49.395]  God bless.
[03:24:50.802 --> 03:24:56.884]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:24:56.884 --> 03:25:04.366]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:25:04.366 --> 03:25:06.687]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:25:06.687 --> 03:25:10.248]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[03:25:12.188 --> 03:25:20.350]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[03:25:20.350 --> 03:25:26.252]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[03:25:26.252 --> 03:25:36.995]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[03:25:36.995 --> 03:25:38.176]  Thank you and God bless.
[03:25:39.036 --> 03:25:45.459]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[03:25:45.459 --> 03:25:47.279]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:26:18.954 --> 03:26:23.037]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:26:23.037 --> 03:26:27.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:26:27.960 --> 03:26:34.363]  And by the grace of God, we are live, still on air, thanks to you holding us in position like God holds the universe together with his will.
[03:26:34.363 --> 03:26:37.505]  You hold us on air with your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer.
[03:26:37.505 --> 03:26:38.866]  Thank you so much to all of you.
[03:26:38.866 --> 03:26:45.210]  All right, so continuing here, you see the predatory angle that society goes in.
[03:26:45.953 --> 03:27:01.838]  When we don't hold up decency and honor and honor the individual, when we don't tie down powerful organizations, they always get out of control and become tyrannical, which means the great lizard, the great tyranny, the great snake.
[03:27:01.838 --> 03:27:03.099]  And that's where we are right now.
[03:27:03.099 --> 03:27:13.182]  And remember how many times I specifically told you they're going to bring in world government, a world ID, using a virus, using fear, that they're going to implode the third world and use giant migrant waves.
[03:27:13.803 --> 03:27:20.568]  To come in and collapse the Western world, then there'll be a worldwide collapse, and then they'll call for a worldwide Marshall Plan.
[03:27:20.568 --> 03:27:40.103]  Now notice, I've been saying this for at least 18 years, since a bunch of documents came out of the North American Union secret treaty that George W. Bush had secretly signed us onto at Temple, Texas, there at Baylor.
[03:27:40.103 --> 03:27:40.524]  Remember that?
[03:27:43.888 --> 03:27:44.168]  Money.
[03:27:44.168 --> 03:27:46.529]  The first time we got documents was 18 years ago.
[03:27:46.529 --> 03:27:54.550]  Then right before Endgame came out, 15 years ago, Judicial Watch sued again and got the Banff, Canada document.
[03:27:54.550 --> 03:27:55.690]  Several thousand pages.
[03:27:55.690 --> 03:27:58.831]  I scanned over every one of the damn things.
[03:27:58.831 --> 03:28:00.771]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:00.771 --> 03:28:03.132]  Remember when Lou Dobbs was number one back then?
[03:28:03.132 --> 03:28:04.252]  I was seeing it and it was different.
[03:28:04.252 --> 03:28:09.473]  Actually, let me change the whole format because, you know, he had like 10 million viewers a night.
[03:28:09.473 --> 03:28:12.934]  So, they fired him and, you know, shut all that down later.
[03:28:14.144 --> 03:28:15.104]  But he had the documents.
[03:28:15.104 --> 03:28:18.366]  So, how did I know they were going to use the virus?
[03:28:18.366 --> 03:28:21.847]  How did I know that then they would collapse the third world and use those giant waves to bring the U.N.
[03:28:21.847 --> 03:28:22.108]  control?
[03:28:22.108 --> 03:28:28.350]  And then after they were done with that, they then collapsed the currency of the world, and they called for a global Marshall Plan.
[03:28:28.350 --> 03:28:37.074]  They had over 500 corporate leaders of the Fortune 500, and the leaders of all the Western world met in Banff, Canada, in 2007.
[03:28:37.074 --> 03:28:42.016]  Look it up for yourself.
[03:28:42.016 --> 03:28:43.557]  And the Judicial Watch got the documents.
[03:28:44.378 --> 03:28:45.819]  It was 2006, we got them in 2007.
[03:28:45.819 --> 03:28:47.861]  And it's all there!
[03:28:47.861 --> 03:28:49.182]  So again, how did I know all this?
[03:28:49.182 --> 03:29:03.914]  Because they told us, and I keep hammering this because I was in a CBS last night, and I had almost everyone, Hispanic folks that were in there, white folks that were in there, that was in there, white folks, Hispanic folks, almost all of them were listeners.
[03:29:03.914 --> 03:29:07.276]  The clerk, the manager, everybody.
[03:29:07.276 --> 03:29:09.578]  And a guy walks up, and I'm walking out, and he goes, I appreciate you, Alex.
[03:29:09.578 --> 03:29:11.380]  He goes, you know, you're like a prophet.
[03:29:11.380 --> 03:29:12.781]  In fact, you know all this stuff for the people.
[03:29:13.504 --> 03:29:15.045]  And I said, sir, do you listen to the show?
[03:29:15.045 --> 03:29:16.045]  He goes, yeah, I catch it sometimes.
[03:29:16.045 --> 03:29:21.628]  And I said, sir, please, it's important you understand that this is all public.
[03:29:21.628 --> 03:29:23.969]  But it's not about us getting credit.
[03:29:23.969 --> 03:29:25.190]  That's stupid.
[03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:29.192]  It's about understanding it's a criminal enemy plan.
[03:29:29.192 --> 03:29:31.693]  A criminal enemy plan.
[03:29:31.693 --> 03:29:38.637]  And so you read the Banff Canada, the hundreds of hundreds of thousands of people, literally a conservative thousand, over.
[03:29:38.637 --> 03:29:40.778]  But you took the Operation Lockstep a few years later, 2011.
[03:29:43.024 --> 03:29:43.084]  2010.
[03:29:43.084 --> 03:29:46.545]  And it's even more specific.
[03:29:46.545 --> 03:29:48.386]  They're on the find its house.
[03:29:48.386 --> 03:29:52.307]  Then they war game that sucker every year with the major think tanks.
[03:29:52.307 --> 03:30:07.551]  So there's literally thousands of battle pages and plans and hundreds of drills they've done for what you're now seeing with Event 201, which is COVID-19.
[03:30:07.551 --> 03:30:08.591]  And this is it.
[03:30:08.591 --> 03:30:11.632]  This is a civilization collapsing weapon.
[03:30:11.632 --> 03:30:12.332]  The fear of it.
[03:30:12.978 --> 03:30:27.446]  It brings us to our knees and now, imagine having all the major channels, Don Lemon's the best example, we got a compilation of him two days ago and then last night, saying you shouldn't leave your house, can't go to the grocery store, shouldn't have a job, it's time to blame the unvaccinated.
[03:30:27.446 --> 03:30:38.393]  All these Republican governors and Democrat governors saying it, got world leaders saying it, even though, in plain view, it's all the 90 plus percent vaccinated countries that have the highest level of COVID, because it's not COVID, it's by protein.
[03:30:38.393 --> 03:30:40.434]  We can jam that truth down their necks.
[03:30:41.095 --> 03:30:44.797]  We need to be at the hospital showing their MP right now, because they're saying they're full.
[03:30:44.797 --> 03:30:53.042]  We need to be printing off those articles, those documents, and those links that Don Salazar has in that article, then FortWorth.com, and take it to your churches if we can.
[03:30:53.042 --> 03:31:03.307]  Because believe me, if you don't get aggressive and get in front of your church or your Sunday school, if you don't get aggressive and go to the city council and talk about this, everywhere you can get a voice, they're going to come to your door.
[03:31:03.307 --> 03:31:04.648]  So, everybody better figure this out.
[03:31:04.648 --> 03:31:09.751]  Either they're going to submit and think you rolled the dice and take these shots, let them walk the world down,
[03:31:10.430 --> 03:31:19.538]  Well, I've declared you a non-essential, and waking your starving death in a couple of years in your house, or you can fight back now and change the world and wake a lot of people up in the process of this fight.
[03:31:19.538 --> 03:31:21.119]  So I know you're fighters.
[03:31:21.119 --> 03:31:22.600]  I'm just telling you.
[03:31:22.600 --> 03:31:24.281]  Now is the time in the info war to fight more than ever.
[03:31:24.281 --> 03:31:34.510]  So here it is, Don Lemon again, last night, with the night before, compiled, declaring war on you, saying you will starve to death if you don't let me put something experimental in your body.
[03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:37.873]  The essence of violating the Nuremberg Code, coercion for experimental drugs.
[03:31:37.873 --> 03:31:38.133]  Here it is.
[03:31:40.051 --> 03:31:41.472]  We could have had this under control.
[03:31:41.472 --> 03:31:52.082]  We were well on our way, and the only people that you can blame, the only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth, maybe they should be shamed, are the unvaccinated.
[03:31:52.082 --> 03:31:58.148]  The unvaccinated people have put us in the position that we're in now, and it is not a good place.
[03:31:58.148 --> 03:31:59.910]  You have to be more direct.
[03:32:01.521 --> 03:32:04.562]  A more concerted effort to say, get vaccinated.
[03:32:04.562 --> 03:32:08.463]  Because you're not just killing yourself, you're gonna kill other people.
[03:32:08.463 --> 03:32:10.144]  That's what you have to start telling people.
[03:32:10.144 --> 03:32:15.745]  You gotta start telling people, if you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this office or this place of business.
[03:32:15.745 --> 03:32:18.466]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come to work.
[03:32:18.466 --> 03:32:21.507]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this gym.
[03:32:21.507 --> 03:32:26.268]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this, get onto this airplane.
[03:32:26.268 --> 03:32:28.329]  It has nothing to do with freedom!
[03:32:29.329 --> 03:32:30.869]  There's nothing new with liberty.
[03:32:30.869 --> 03:32:35.531]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[03:32:35.531 --> 03:32:36.571]  You don't have that.
[03:32:36.571 --> 03:32:39.072]  You have to drive the speed limit.
[03:32:39.072 --> 03:32:41.012]  You have to obey the rules.
[03:32:41.012 --> 03:32:45.774]  Put some rules in place that will demand that people get vaccinated.
[03:32:45.774 --> 03:32:49.015]  You can't just go around and say, well look, it's my personal freedom and my liberty.
[03:32:49.015 --> 03:32:51.736]  I want to go 150 miles an hour if I want to.
[03:32:51.736 --> 03:32:52.336]  Sure you can.
[03:32:53.393 --> 03:32:55.695]  But you have to suffer the consequences for it.
[03:32:55.695 --> 03:33:01.321]  Either you, whether you kill yourself, or you get a citation, or your driver's license gets taken away.
[03:33:01.321 --> 03:33:07.848]  You have to have certain rules in a society if we all are going to continue to live and keep each other alive.
[03:33:07.848 --> 03:33:11.452]  You cannot be that selfish and, quite frankly, that ignorant.
[03:33:14.835 --> 03:33:16.776]  So that's just him last night.
[03:33:16.776 --> 03:33:21.619]  There's another clip that we played where he says you shouldn't be allowed to have food, you shouldn't be allowed to go to the grocery store.
[03:33:21.619 --> 03:33:22.459]  That was from the night before.
[03:33:22.459 --> 03:33:26.501]  We'll play that coming up next segment because that's really next level.
[03:33:26.501 --> 03:33:27.842]  So we do have a thing called the Nuremberg Code.
[03:33:27.842 --> 03:33:29.223]  We have federal and state law.
[03:33:29.223 --> 03:33:31.664]  This is not even FDA approved.
[03:33:31.664 --> 03:33:34.906]  It's got horrible side effects and now it doesn't even protect you.
[03:33:34.906 --> 03:33:36.887]  It's all a lie.
[03:33:36.887 --> 03:33:39.728]  It's all a lie for them to be able to put in our bodies what they want.
[03:33:39.728 --> 03:33:41.509]  These are terrorists.
[03:33:41.509 --> 03:33:43.250]  These people are literally eugenicists.
[03:33:43.866 --> 03:33:45.687]  Up there now, trying to normalize it.
[03:33:45.687 --> 03:33:46.468]  See, they've got a problem.
[03:33:46.468 --> 03:33:48.269]  Half the public or more hasn't taken it.
[03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:51.471]  How are they going to bully us when they're not even the majority, you see?
[03:33:51.471 --> 03:33:53.252]  So the answer is, get back in the bully's face.
[03:33:53.252 --> 03:33:56.955]  What do you do to a bully who says you can't have food for your kids or leave your house?
[03:33:56.955 --> 03:33:58.616]  Kathleen Sebelius said the same thing.
[03:33:58.616 --> 03:33:59.576]  World leaders are saying it.
[03:33:59.576 --> 03:34:00.677]  Macron said it two weeks ago.
[03:34:00.677 --> 03:34:01.498]  No grocery store.
[03:34:01.498 --> 03:34:03.519]  Shouldn't be allowed to have your kids.
[03:34:03.519 --> 03:34:05.980]  People had riots nationwide over it.
[03:34:05.980 --> 03:34:07.181]  This is the time to get aggressive.
[03:34:07.181 --> 03:34:08.082]  This is the time to say no.
[03:34:08.669 --> 03:34:11.211]  This is the time to go bullhorn these people at their houses.
[03:34:11.211 --> 03:34:12.312]  I mean Don Lemon.
[03:34:12.312 --> 03:34:13.673]  They're the ones that want to make us uncomfortable.
[03:34:13.673 --> 03:34:15.115]  They're the ones that want to push up on our body.
[03:34:15.115 --> 03:34:17.237]  They're the ones that have attacked us first.
[03:34:17.237 --> 03:34:21.540]  We don't physically want to put some deadly thing that grows protein crystals in them that kills them.
[03:34:21.540 --> 03:34:22.361]  I'm not trying to murder them.
[03:34:22.361 --> 03:34:23.162]  I'm just trying to murder us.
[03:34:24.201 --> 03:34:27.802]  But we need to find out where Don Lemon goes to work out.
[03:34:27.802 --> 03:34:28.922]  Where Don Lemon goes to church.
[03:34:28.922 --> 03:34:29.762]  Of course he doesn't.
[03:34:29.762 --> 03:34:45.166]  Where Don Lemon goes, and we need to go get in his face, because they want to get all the corporations together to say, if you don't have an ID and a digital pass that we check when you go to a store, or you go to your church, or when your car turns on, that we're not going to let you live and let you have a life.
[03:34:45.166 --> 03:34:49.267]  This is all about the global ID for the global tax and the global order.
[03:34:49.267 --> 03:34:50.927]  And again, just like the idiots that took the deadly shot.
[03:34:51.676 --> 03:34:52.596]  They were supposed to be heroes.
[03:34:52.596 --> 03:34:56.197]  They're the ones now told you gotta still wear a mask and you're the super spreader.
[03:34:56.197 --> 03:34:58.738]  And they go, why would they target their own minions that follow their orders?
[03:34:58.738 --> 03:35:01.159]  Because that's who the abuser abuses.
[03:35:01.159 --> 03:35:04.040]  It's the people that follow the orders.
[03:35:04.040 --> 03:35:06.381]  So everybody knows medical experimentation's wrong.
[03:35:06.381 --> 03:35:08.361]  Everybody knows they couldn't approve mRNA.
[03:35:08.361 --> 03:35:09.622]  Everybody knows this doesn't protect you.
[03:35:09.622 --> 03:35:11.302]  Everybody knows Bill Gates wants to kill you.
[03:35:11.302 --> 03:35:13.243]  Everybody knows CNN hates America.
[03:35:13.243 --> 03:35:14.643]  Everybody knows this.
[03:35:14.643 --> 03:35:17.604]  Saudi Arabia, been 20% inoculated.
[03:35:17.604 --> 03:35:19.225]  But they say they're better than us.
[03:35:19.225 --> 03:35:19.945]  All those other countries.
[03:35:20.831 --> 03:35:22.112]  India won't take our shots.
[03:35:22.112 --> 03:35:24.173]  Less than 10% have taken theirs.
[03:35:24.173 --> 03:35:31.636]  China's less inoculated than we are, but we're told we're bad, that America's at fault for the whole world, when it's actually the countries that are almost fully vaccinated that have all the problems.
[03:35:31.636 --> 03:35:32.636]  Those are facts.
[03:35:32.636 --> 03:35:35.498]  That's truth, you little lying monster, Don Lemon.
[03:35:35.498 --> 03:35:37.839]  But Don Lemon is a nobody.
[03:35:37.839 --> 03:35:39.119]  He reads off a teleprompter.
[03:35:39.119 --> 03:35:39.819]  He's a puppet.
[03:35:39.819 --> 03:35:41.100]  He's not a real man.
[03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:42.861]  He's like Pinocchio.
[03:35:42.861 --> 03:35:44.481]  We'll be right back as we fight these tyrants.
[03:35:44.481 --> 03:35:45.462]  This gets crazier from here.
[03:35:46.053 --> 03:35:47.994]  Resistance is victory, submission is death.
[03:35:47.994 --> 03:35:49.454]  InfoWars.com tomorrow at 6.
[03:35:49.454 --> 03:36:03.157]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at InfoWarsStore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.
[03:36:03.157 --> 03:36:13.920]  It is the perfect companion to the new activated charcoal toothpaste all under our new line by Dr. Jones Naturals that will naturally give your mouth and breath a deep clean.
[03:36:14.900 --> 03:36:25.223]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients like real peppermint oil, thyme oil, xylitol, and of course, high quality charcoal.
[03:36:25.223 --> 03:36:36.406]  Not only fluoride free, this mouthwash is completely free of other dangerous ingredients such as SLS, harsh detergents, BPA, and so much more.
[03:36:36.406 --> 03:36:40.487]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[03:36:40.487 --> 03:36:43.848]  So get your bottle of the new Activated Charcoal Mouthwash
[03:36:50.230 --> 03:37:00.573]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[03:37:00.573 --> 03:37:08.536]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[03:37:09.687 --> 03:37:10.527]  Well guess what?
[03:37:10.527 --> 03:37:24.534]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[03:37:25.715 --> 03:37:31.218]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[03:37:31.218 --> 03:37:37.582]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[03:37:37.582 --> 03:37:46.887]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[03:37:46.887 --> 03:37:47.948]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:50.507 --> 03:37:58.669]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:37:58.669 --> 03:38:07.432]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:38:07.432 --> 03:38:14.394]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:38:14.394 --> 03:38:17.014]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[03:38:17.014 --> 03:38:19.455]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[03:38:19.815 --> 03:38:20.596]  We're good to go.
[03:38:49.735 --> 03:38:51.236]  We're good to go.
[03:39:12.370 --> 03:39:20.536]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[03:39:45.635 --> 03:39:47.457]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:40:26.683 --> 03:40:35.046]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[03:40:35.046 --> 03:40:37.967]  It's the final segment here.
[03:40:37.967 --> 03:40:41.589]  And we had played last night's Don Lemon, where he said a lot of horrible things.
[03:40:41.589 --> 03:40:42.889]  He's just the standard talking point.
[03:40:42.889 --> 03:40:45.210]  But I want to play you the night before last.
[03:40:45.210 --> 03:40:49.952]  This is a short clip in case new listeners tuned in and think I'm making this up.
[03:40:49.952 --> 03:40:54.894]  Same thing Macron said in France, you can't go to the grocery store, you can't have a job, which means starved to death.
[03:40:55.421 --> 03:40:57.182]  This is called siege, total war.
[03:40:57.182 --> 03:41:00.345]  Here's a clip of it.
[03:41:00.345 --> 03:41:01.466]  Um, I don't know.
[03:41:01.466 --> 03:41:06.090]  I'm sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this, but, um, don't get the vaccine.
[03:41:06.090 --> 03:41:07.851]  You can't go to the supermarket.
[03:41:07.851 --> 03:41:08.632]  Don't have the vaccine.
[03:41:08.632 --> 03:41:09.172]  You don't show it.
[03:41:09.172 --> 03:41:10.514]  Can't go to the ballgame.
[03:41:10.514 --> 03:41:11.995]  Don't have the vaccine.
[03:41:11.995 --> 03:41:13.416]  Can't go to work.
[03:41:13.416 --> 03:41:15.217]  You don't have the vaccine.
[03:41:15.217 --> 03:41:15.738]  Can't come here.
[03:41:15.738 --> 03:41:18.300]  No shirt, no shoes, no service.
[03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:20.482]  That's what I think we should be right now.
[03:41:20.482 --> 03:41:21.383]  That's enough of this tyrant.
[03:41:21.383 --> 03:41:21.783]  So again,
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:26.521]  Let's just say the vaccine works and it's as good as pumpkin pie or Mother's Book, which we know it isn't.
[03:41:26.521 --> 03:41:29.802]  But Bill Gates gave it to us because he loves us.
[03:41:29.802 --> 03:41:31.182]  He's changed his mind and wants to save us now.
[03:41:31.182 --> 03:41:37.864]  Even though he's been caught in 20-plus countries injecting people with steroids and poison and killing Africans and Indians.
[03:41:37.864 --> 03:41:39.024]  He's been banned in those countries.
[03:41:39.024 --> 03:41:39.984]  It doesn't matter.
[03:41:39.984 --> 03:41:40.884]  He's been banned in Kenya.
[03:41:40.884 --> 03:41:43.485]  It doesn't matter if he's banned in India.
[03:41:43.485 --> 03:41:43.825]  It's okay.
[03:41:44.985 --> 03:41:47.087]  He's a good killer, and he wants you to take a shot.
[03:41:47.087 --> 03:41:48.408]  Let's just say the shot's good.
[03:41:48.408 --> 03:41:56.153]  The world's ID in your medical records, in any bar you go in, or restaurant, or gym, or hotel, wanting to see your status.
[03:41:56.153 --> 03:42:03.779]  And then just on the paper, once they have like six places for the shots you're going to get for COVID, they said a year and a half ago, it'll take multiple shots, it isn't going to work.
[03:42:03.779 --> 03:42:06.021]  They had this all prepared.
[03:42:06.021 --> 03:42:11.064]  So again, they want you to be a chump, and pretend you're cool.
[03:42:11.064 --> 03:42:11.845]  So the answer is,
[03:42:12.839 --> 03:42:18.684]  Reaching out to all these leftists and explaining to them this is about a war, and this is not partisan.
[03:42:18.684 --> 03:42:24.029]  And use those clips of when the Democrats, when Trump was trying to warp speed it, because he got hoodwinked.
[03:42:24.029 --> 03:42:26.711]  They're like, sir, we'll never reopen the economy for two years.
[03:42:26.711 --> 03:42:28.273]  He goes, well, we'll kill the economy.
[03:42:28.273 --> 03:42:29.674]  Well, there's no vaccine.
[03:42:29.674 --> 03:42:32.717]  Then they came to him and said, well, actually, sir, they can get it ready quicker than that.
[03:42:32.717 --> 03:42:34.038]  They set Trump up.
[03:42:34.038 --> 03:42:34.879]  We get it.
[03:42:34.879 --> 03:42:35.399]  We know.
[03:42:35.399 --> 03:42:36.120]  Moving past that.
[03:42:37.595 --> 03:42:39.195]  The point is, now we're here.
[03:42:39.195 --> 03:42:39.996]  And they don't work.
[03:42:39.996 --> 03:42:40.556]  They're a fraud.
[03:42:40.556 --> 03:42:42.716]  They're actually causing the majority of illnesses.
[03:42:42.716 --> 03:42:43.877]  Fauci is liable.
[03:42:43.877 --> 03:42:45.277]  Gates is liable.
[03:42:45.277 --> 03:42:47.538]  This is a perfect market where it never works.
[03:42:47.538 --> 03:42:49.338]  You gotta have more, more, more.
[03:42:49.338 --> 03:42:50.659]  They're all admitting it on record.
[03:42:50.659 --> 03:42:52.939]  It's time for them to go to prison.
[03:42:52.939 --> 03:42:54.680]  Because they're now blaming unvaccinated.
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:57.200]  They're now blaming you and I. They're now coming after us.
[03:42:57.200 --> 03:42:59.041]  They're blaming the vaccinated.
[03:42:59.041 --> 03:43:01.782]  This is a way to say all humans are racist and evil and bad.
[03:43:01.782 --> 03:43:02.662]  Do what we say.
[03:43:02.662 --> 03:43:05.843]  All humans are poisonous and have evil things inside of you.
[03:43:05.843 --> 03:43:06.423]  Wear a mask.
[03:43:06.423 --> 03:43:06.823]  You're dirty.
[03:43:06.823 --> 03:43:07.183]  You're evil.
[03:43:07.876 --> 03:43:11.057]  Teaching us to hate ourselves, teaching us to be depopulated.
[03:43:11.057 --> 03:43:12.517]  This is their globalist religion.
[03:43:12.517 --> 03:43:16.298]  So we just say to them, if this is all true, you go first.
[03:43:16.298 --> 03:43:22.899]  Knowing about their systems, knowing about their control, is how we win the war against them.
[03:43:22.899 --> 03:43:27.500]  Understanding the New World Order, you then understand the future because they're in control of the planet.
[03:43:27.500 --> 03:43:32.360]  That is incredibly valuable, even if you were a sociopath, just from a stock market position.
[03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:35.261]  And as the public figures out that people that are experts on the New World Order,
[03:43:36.838 --> 03:43:39.419]  Are the most valuable information conduits out there.
[03:43:39.419 --> 03:43:42.961]  The globalists don't give the general public all these secrets.
[03:43:42.961 --> 03:43:47.703]  They communicate in the CFR and through white papers, most of it classified, a lot of it public.
[03:43:47.703 --> 03:43:52.425]  So if you have a deep knowledge of it, you're basically a globalist, you're just not with them.
[03:43:52.425 --> 03:43:55.846]  And to win any war, they'll tell you, get in the mind of your enemy.
[03:43:55.846 --> 03:43:57.207]  Think like your enemy.
[03:43:57.207 --> 03:43:58.867]  Understand your enemy.
[03:43:58.867 --> 03:44:01.228]  Immerse yourself in the enemy.
[03:44:01.228 --> 03:44:05.010]  I've done that, and that's why info wars are such a brain trust and so key and so critical.
[03:44:05.965 --> 03:44:10.509]  And that's why I'm willing to lose my life in this fight, because I know as I up the ante, they're going to come after me.
[03:44:10.509 --> 03:44:12.110]  That's okay.
[03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:13.712]  Because in the end, they must lose.
[03:44:13.712 --> 03:44:15.914]  They must fail, or all of humanity is going to be lost.
[03:44:15.914 --> 03:44:17.475]  And I look at my four-year-old daughter.
[03:44:17.475 --> 03:44:19.657]  I look at how innocent she is.
[03:44:19.657 --> 03:44:22.539]  I'm not going to let them put her into this world they're trying to build.
[03:44:22.539 --> 03:44:25.322]  I have a responsibility before God to do it.
[03:44:25.322 --> 03:44:31.347]  I just want to thank the listeners, and viewers, and the InfoWars family, and this great crew.
[03:44:32.549 --> 03:44:33.309]  We're good to go.
[03:44:56.337 --> 03:44:58.661]  People like Matt Gaetz being set up by the FBI and others.
[03:44:58.661 --> 03:44:59.722]  Going through the fire now.
[03:44:59.722 --> 03:45:00.964]  Learning how really evil it is.
[03:45:00.964 --> 03:45:02.687]  Not being naive anymore.
[03:45:02.687 --> 03:45:04.169]  As the enemy pressures, they wake up.
[03:45:04.169 --> 03:45:07.494]  Matt Gaetz talking about the FBI setting up fake criminal groups.
[03:45:07.494 --> 03:45:09.316]  And it's provocateur-ing militias.
[03:45:09.316 --> 03:45:10.739]  And provocateur-ing the Capitol.
[03:45:10.739 --> 03:45:11.600]  It's all coming out.
[03:45:11.600 --> 03:45:12.181]  Here's Matt Gaetz.
[03:45:15.009 --> 03:45:18.951]  Every day in America, people are locked in prison.
[03:45:18.951 --> 03:45:26.175]  It's not every day that people are locked out of a prison, which is what happened to multiple members of Congress today.
[03:45:26.175 --> 03:45:31.517]  We have two principal responsibilities, to appropriate funds and to conduct oversight.
[03:45:31.517 --> 03:45:44.104]  How does the Biden administration expect us to participate in the representative republic when they deprive us of access to information that would inform our oversight work and our appropriations decisions?
[03:45:44.764 --> 03:45:51.167]  The questions we've asked have gone unanswered for months, and they fall into two principal categories.
[03:45:51.167 --> 03:46:00.953]  First, are their defendants, as a consequence of their conduct on January 6th, being deprived of access to potentially exculpatory evidence?
[03:46:01.793 --> 03:46:08.158]  We have seen that the FBI has a history of animating criminal conduct.
[03:46:08.158 --> 03:46:14.083]  That is precisely what happened in Michigan, and it may be what happened on January 6th as well.
[03:46:14.083 --> 03:46:21.329]  To answer that question, we need access to the 14,000 hours of videos that Congressman Gosar has continuously called for.
[03:46:21.929 --> 03:46:26.713]  To answer that question, to get that evidence, we sought a meeting with the Attorney General.
[03:46:26.713 --> 03:46:40.484]  We went to the Department of Justice, and we weren't even allowed in the lobby to have a meeting with an Attorney General who still, to this day, has not shown up for an oversight hearing before the Oversight Committee or the House Judiciary Committee.
[03:46:40.484 --> 03:46:42.485]  What is Merrick Garland hiding?
[03:46:43.286 --> 03:46:48.672]  The second category of concerns deals with the specific treatment of detainees.
[03:46:48.672 --> 03:46:52.375]  To get answers, we did what members of Congress normally do.
[03:46:52.375 --> 03:46:55.659]  We showed up at the facility and sought a tour.
[03:46:55.659 --> 03:46:59.383]  This happens for Republicans under Democrat administrations.
[03:46:59.383 --> 03:47:02.426]  It happened for Democrats under Republican administrations.
[03:47:02.426 --> 03:47:04.968]  And now there is an unprecedented effort.
[03:47:05.709 --> 03:47:18.613]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what tyranny looks like.
[03:47:18.613 --> 03:47:19.734]  Congress has oversight.
[03:47:19.734 --> 03:47:21.074]  They can get into any prison they want.
[03:47:21.074 --> 03:47:23.495]  They can get into any underground base they want.
[03:47:23.495 --> 03:47:35.119]  They're supposed to at least get into the nuclear silos, everything, but they can't go to that place where 500 plus, mainly innocent people, I mean, and those who are even there for crapping on the table or fighting with a cop, they'd already be out on bond normally in two days.
[03:47:35.905 --> 03:47:39.747]  But no, because they're patriots, they're being tortured in there.
[03:47:39.747 --> 03:47:43.708]  Because they also don't want people to get out who got provocateured by feds.
[03:47:43.708 --> 03:47:54.632]  And that's what the few people that have gotten through the lawyers are saying is, I was set up, I was sent in, I was told Q was in command, I was told I was in this group, I was told in that group, you know, Antifa led folks in.
[03:47:54.632 --> 03:47:56.113]  And now they want to put us all in these prisons.
[03:47:56.113 --> 03:47:56.993]  It's so dangerous.
[03:47:56.993 --> 03:47:58.774]  It's so illegal.
[03:47:58.774 --> 03:47:59.614]  It's so out of control.
[03:47:59.614 --> 03:48:00.855]  All right, the war room.
[03:48:02.248 --> 03:48:08.972]  It's coming up, and I'm not sure if it's Harrison Smith, I'm not sure if it's Owen Schroer hosting it, but I'm sure it'll be informative and powerful, and they're going to have open phones.
[03:48:08.972 --> 03:48:18.658]  A lot of open phones this next week, and I'll be doing some extra live broadcasts as well, where we just take calls from people that have taken the inoculation, so they can tell their First-Year account something the enemy doesn't want.
[03:48:18.658 --> 03:48:26.122]  It's true, open lines, unfiltered, InfoWars is such a valuable network in the fight against tyranny, so just thanks for letting it continue on.
[03:48:26.122 --> 03:48:30.484]  We've said it for a week, and then again for another week, I will end 100% on Sunday night.
[03:48:32.034 --> 03:48:34.897]  10% off on all the high-quality, affordable food right now, the last decade.
[03:48:34.897 --> 03:48:36.139]  It's really good.
[03:48:36.139 --> 03:48:38.141]  That is very low-cost.
[03:48:38.141 --> 03:48:39.403]  Ready to ship to you.
[03:48:39.403 --> 03:48:39.763]  10% off.
[03:48:39.763 --> 03:48:42.706]  InfoWarshore.com, the full catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[03:48:42.706 --> 03:48:43.367]  10% off.
[03:48:43.367 --> 03:48:49.054]  Only place you're going to get that is InfoWarshore.com, and that also funds our Operation 360 win.
[03:48:49.054 --> 03:48:50.655]  You need to get prepared.
[03:48:50.655 --> 03:48:52.658]  And if you also go to MyPillow.com,
[03:48:53.502 --> 03:48:54.243]  We're good to go.
[03:49:13.123 --> 03:49:13.923]  We're good to go.
[03:49:33.835 --> 03:49:39.279]  I declare anybody questioning the election, anybody that's questioning lockdowns as a terrorist, they're getting false flags ready.
[03:49:39.279 --> 03:49:44.462]  So we're trying to build our war chest up right now to be able to operate, even if funds aren't coming in for a while.
[03:49:44.462 --> 03:49:46.744]  This is serious war.
[03:49:46.744 --> 03:49:52.568]  And it's all in God's hands, but it's up to us to get the word out so that others have a choice to make.
[03:49:52.568 --> 03:49:53.588]  God warns everybody.
[03:49:53.588 --> 03:49:56.250]  So it's your job to help warn people.
[03:49:56.250 --> 03:49:57.211]  God's working through you.
[03:49:57.211 --> 03:49:57.971]  God's working through me.
[03:49:57.971 --> 03:49:59.432]  And I know that's my mission.
[03:49:59.432 --> 03:50:00.333]  I get really stressed out.
[03:50:00.333 --> 03:50:01.654]  You know, God puts a hand on my shoulder.
[03:50:02.697 --> 03:50:05.059]  So the Holy Spirit says, listen, it's not your job to fix all this.
[03:50:05.059 --> 03:50:07.761]  It's your job to tell the truth and stand up and you do the right thing.
[03:50:07.761 --> 03:50:09.062]  And then people have a choice.
[03:50:09.062 --> 03:50:09.802]  And that's what this is.
[03:50:09.802 --> 03:50:11.684]  This is a big test.
[03:50:11.684 --> 03:50:14.205]  And the Globals are the losers.
[03:50:14.205 --> 03:50:14.826]  We're the winners.
[03:50:15.666 --> 03:50:16.827]  And we're going to win this together.
[03:50:16.827 --> 03:50:17.028]  All right.
[03:50:17.028 --> 03:50:19.070]  The War Room is coming up right now.
[03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:21.974]  And then I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:50:21.974 --> 03:50:24.376]  with the Sunday 5 edition.
[03:50:24.376 --> 03:50:25.998]  We've got some big guests coming up Sunday.
[03:50:25.998 --> 03:50:27.320]  Big guests this next week.
[03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:27.800]  Thank you all.
[03:50:27.800 --> 03:50:28.381]  I love you all.
[03:50:28.381 --> 03:50:29.082]  I love the crew.
[03:50:29.082 --> 03:50:29.823]  Thank you so much.
[03:50:29.823 --> 03:50:30.744]  And I will see you soon.
[03:50:30.744 --> 03:50:31.685]  M4Warriors.com.
[03:50:31.685 --> 03:50:32.586]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:50:32.586 --> 03:50:33.247]  And I'll share those links.
