[00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:03.837]  Big Brother.
[00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.158]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:07.938]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:10.019]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.159]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:18.060]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, the enemy is now completely out in the open.
[00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:30.403]  There are headlines all over the international press celebrating the end of humanity.
[00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.515]  I've got Politico right here in my hands.
[00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:34.917]  No more babies.
[00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:38.420]  The hormone-altering chemicals threatening human production.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.884]  But it goes on to say, this will save the Earth from the evil humans.
[00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:48.208]  How many decades ago did I detail all of this for you?
[00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:53.233]  But first, let's take a look at what transpired on last time's episode.
[00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:57.097]  Don't let the enemy get you depressed about what's happening today.
[00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:08.804]  As long as you're speaking up, as long as you're standing up, as long as you're saying no to the globalists, as long as you're living and loving your neighbors and being a good person, you're building the human community that is the American dream, that is the renaissance.
[00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:30.900]  And this Irishman who's now an American, he said, listen, you don't get Joe Biden's name, right?
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.200]  He's a stooge.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.401]  And I said, wow, you're right.
[00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:36.503]  A stooge is a puppet put in by somebody else.
[00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:37.123]  Who's an idiot.
[00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:46.285]  But who's also used to rule over people so the stooge gets the blame and the actual controllers don't get the blame for the crimes they're committing.
[00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:47.626]  He said that's exactly right.
[00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:48.947]  He is a puppet.
[00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:50.328]  He is an imposter.
[00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:51.068]  He is a fraud.
[00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:56.612]  So everybody should look at the different definitions of stooges and understand what that is.
[00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:58.353]  That's what he is.
[00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:04.758]  So I want to thank you both and I want to thank the former general, I keep calling him general,
[00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.961]  My, uh, the guy who runs that outfit over there.
[00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:21.427]  Uh, I want to make sure we thank the secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we just talked about and for recommending these two women for promotion.
[00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:23.788]  You know, the Dune books by Frank Herbert are amazing.
[00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:25.809]  The movie by
[00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:30.246]  Lynch was powerful, but also cheesy in parts.
[00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:39.591]  But it's accurate as a historical fiction reference to some of the things that have actually happened in the real world.
[00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:50.916]  And if you notice, Baron Harkonnen is supposedly losing control of the planet Arrakis with a spice, which is basically why this engine technology, the ethos of the globalist, eternal life.
[00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:55.599]  But really they're just setting up the main rival of the emperor, Duke Atreides,
[00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:11.700]  But before, after he's set up at Trades and his son's been thrown out in the desert and all the rest of it, he sends in the beast Rabban, his nephew, to squeeze and attack and destroy all his opposition.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.867]  But then he removes him later, gives him the blame, and puts in Fahd Rabban, who he really wants to be his main heir, as the savior.
[00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:24.310]  So they put him under charity this side, and then
[00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.538]  Fade comes in and the tyranny is still really high.
[00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:35.022]  They would have hated Fade, but because the tyranny was so much higher before, they now accept that new benchmark of tyranny.
[00:03:35.022 --> 00:03:37.444]  Fade.
[00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:39.825]  Rabban.
[00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:43.328]  Go quietly.
[00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:51.233]  No other great house of the Landstrahd must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.
[00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:52.994]  The entire Landstrahd
[00:03:55.045 --> 00:04:09.150]  And that's what you do with a stooge who you put in as a viceroy or a vice king.
[00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.711]  And the Romans would do this, the British Empire would do this, the French would do this.
[00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:20.233]  It's in the history books that they would come in, oppress a group, take them over, put in somebody to be unpopular, to squeeze and be a tyrant.
[00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:21.754]  Then their own publications and own
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.361]  Are you kidding?
[00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:46.802]  Joe Biden is.
[00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:48.543]  Joe Biden is a stooge.
[00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:49.664]  Joe Biden is a puppet.
[00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.745]  We should all start calling him Joe Biden's stooge.
[00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:54.486]  So, that said, they brought him in.
[00:04:54.486 --> 00:05:01.730]  They're going to blame him for all the collapse of the economy.
[00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.792]  Look, I've proven that Infowars information is some of the best in the world.
[00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:09.215]  It's just absolutely on target.
[00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:12.260]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.802]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:18.609]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:20.212]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:33.927]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at www.infowarrestore.com are the very best sourced, wild-crafted, organic, and natural products you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:40.491]  Whether it's Natural Defense, or whether it's Ultra 12, or whether it's X2, or DNA Force Plus, or Prostagard, or Vazoviz,
[00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:48.499]  These are all cutting-edge, top-of-the-line products that will help you and your family at the same time fund the InfoWar.
[00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.940]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.123]  Take action today at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:16.457 --> 00:06:21.979]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.981]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:31.222]  It's Tuesday, March 16th.
[00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:32.382]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:35.783]  We are no longer in beta.
[00:06:35.783 --> 00:06:37.744]  We are now under globalist attack.
[00:06:38.473 --> 00:06:41.595]  The planetary depopulation has begun.
[00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:46.478]  We have cracked the code on their exact operations, what is going to unfold, and how to stop them.
[00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:52.501]  It's going to become increasingly obvious to everyone that we're inside a world government extermination operation.
[00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:56.984]  Now you're expecting people to resist that and fight that once they figure it out, and they are going to.
[00:06:56.984 --> 00:07:00.826]  But a large portion of people will actually join with it once it's evident.
[00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:05.269]  They will actually go under mass Stockholm Syndrome and actually consciously serve the evil.
[00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:13.803]  So we are far from out of the woods, but we got a jump on the enemy and we're able to warn people about their exact plans for decades ahead of it happening.
[00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:18.087]  Let me give you some of the incredibly serious headlines today.
[00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:31.017]  Top scientist warns, top scientist, top vaccine scientist warns the world halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or quote uncontrollable monster will be released.
[00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.079]  We're breaking that down coming up today.
[00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:35.216]  Here's Politico.
[00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:36.657]  No more babies.
[00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:39.699]  The hormone-altering chemicals threaten human production.
[00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.081]  Sperm counts are set to reach zero by 2045.
[00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:45.182]  Leading scholar breaks down.
[00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:50.025]  They go on to say this is good to save the earth because humans are bad.
[00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:52.527]  There's a looming solution to all humanity's problems.
[00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:59.508]  By 2024, most men may no longer be able to reproduce because of chemicals in the water.
[00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:02.509]  Where did you hear that before?
[00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:09.611]  2016, Alex Jones, radio host, who once Piers Morgan deported, says government creating gays with chemicals.
[00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:11.831]  That's not actually what I said.
[00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:15.332]  I said that this is a mass chemical operation in other animals.
[00:08:15.332 --> 00:08:17.632]  It makes them be attracted to the same sex.
[00:08:17.632 --> 00:08:18.973]  What are the sperm telling us?
[00:08:18.973 --> 00:08:20.773]  New York Times suddenly admitting I'm right.
[00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:23.096]  It goes on and on.
[00:08:23.096 --> 00:08:28.659]  Now they're creating a sperm vault to house it on the moon because of total collapse.
[00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:34.482]  They've already built a Rockefeller-backed, U.N.-backed seed ark in the Arctic.
[00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:43.327]  And then we've got the Wall Street Journal article that you guys will print for me again, please, with the headline, Looking Forward to the End of Humanity, or the NBC headline.
[00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:53.992]  About how top globalists are going to save us by getting rid of humans and merging us with machines that won't produce the devil gas carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:08:53.992 --> 00:09:01.997]  I don't know if aliens run this, but it sounds like an alien script from a movie where they come here, buy off the establishment for life extension, but they've got to, quote, get rid of the carbon.
[00:09:01.997 --> 00:09:03.798]  We are carbon.
[00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:05.439]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:07.981]  That's just that stack here.
[00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:11.103]  20 nations banning the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[00:09:11.764 --> 00:09:17.426]  Which again, I've noticed even enemy publications going along with that saying, ban it, ban it, ban it.
[00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:23.507]  That's to make mRNA look safe when it's the real one killing people en masse from Moderna and from Pfizer.
[00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:25.448]  And I'm not saying take the other ones as well.
[00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:28.529]  They are virus vector vaccines that inject
[00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.551]  Viruses directly into your cells that reprogram your body.
[00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:34.712]  Simply insane.
[00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:36.712]  And again, it's too evil to fail.
[00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:44.455]  Once they get society to sign on to this, the schools, the lawyers, the doctors, they won't be able to admit they were part of a massive crime.
[00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:55.938]  And so as, just like they got away with giving hundreds of millions of boys autism with the vaccines, now when they kill billions, a lot of people die right when they get the shot, but most people are going to be sterile.
[00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:57.893]  They're going to develop cancer.
[00:09:57.893 --> 00:10:13.218]  By the way, I have a stack of news articles, a stack of news articles confirming, absolutely admitted that the mRNA vaccine causes cancer, major prestigious reports.
[00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:17.512]  From major universities that we'll cover at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:18.993]  By the way, I sent that to the producer.
[00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:19.794]  They may have given it to me.
[00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:21.295]  I did not see it in my stacks.
[00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:26.279]  I sent you the university reports about mRNA is what turns on cancer, not DNA.
[00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.342]  Basically, DNA doesn't ever produce cancer, they've now discovered.
[00:10:29.342 --> 00:10:30.263]  They've done this for decades.
[00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.445]  It's M-R-N-A.
[00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:38.910]  And when they put fake mRNA in that has any errors, it is what causes the cancer.
[00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.812]  So again, almost all cancer is viral.
[00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:47.394]  That's all viruses are, is pieces of RNA and mRNA.
[00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:49.014]  And that's mainline science.
[00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:50.234]  And so the globalists know this.
[00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:55.936]  So they're injecting you with something that turns off proteins in your body that block cancer.
[00:10:55.936 --> 00:11:01.117]  Someone will be reading that report coming up for you today.
[00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:02.097]  There it is.
[00:11:02.097 --> 00:11:07.099]  In a twist, scientists find cancer drivers hidden in RNA, not DNA.
[00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.839]  Read the whole article.
[00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:14.881]  They admit that almost all cancer, like they say, they can't find it in DNA.
[00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.542]  Before they were saying, oh, it's mistakes in your DNA.
[00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:18.182]  No.
[00:11:18.182 --> 00:11:25.405]  When you have a certain type of DNA, it's more susceptible to the keys that are the mRNA.
[00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:30.667]  Certain viruses can get into your DNA when you, quote, have those defects.
[00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:33.908]  But all that means is you're not designed to be running into those type of things.
[00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.169]  But here's Bill Gates in mass running all this.
[00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:37.590]  He says he wants to depopulate you.
[00:11:39.088 --> 00:11:56.679]  Here is the open articles admitting, oh, in Politico, how wonderful, how glorious, how fantastic it's going to be once all of the people are gotten rid of.
[00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:59.341]  There's a looming solution to all of humanity's problems.
[00:11:59.341 --> 00:12:03.664]  By 2024, most men will be able to reproduce.
[00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:06.185]  And we all know that men are the problems.
[00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:07.206]  Men have to be
[00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.039]  Gotten rid of.
[00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:14.882]  Here's the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, one of the most respected in the world.
[00:12:14.882 --> 00:12:16.263]  An article three years ago.
[00:12:16.263 --> 00:12:23.907]  You just spent hours doing your own research that it is the mRNA is basically the sole source of cancer.
[00:12:23.907 --> 00:12:25.028]  What is mRNA?
[00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:26.929]  It is a virus.
[00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:29.090]  What is the AstraZeneca vaccine?
[00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.232]  A virus injected in.
[00:12:32.232 --> 00:12:34.133]  What is the Johnson & Johnson's?
[00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:36.034]  It is a virally delivered
[00:12:36.852 --> 00:12:40.878]  Vaccine carrying the viral payload.
[00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:45.685]  Two viruses combined into your DNA to program it to kill itself.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.823]  And they're telling you in the Wall Street Journal and NBC, you know, everyone's going to be dead soon.
[00:12:51.823 --> 00:12:52.944]  You're all going to die.
[00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:56.807]  The Earth is going to be free of the humans, free of the humans.
[00:12:56.807 --> 00:13:01.190]  And a little demonic elf dancing around.
[00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:08.455]  And we are just watching all of this unfold on a mass scale, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.396]  So I ask you again.
[00:13:11.548 --> 00:13:13.769]  When are you going to wake up out of the trance?
[00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:17.951]  When are you going to come out of it and realize you're under attack?
[00:13:17.951 --> 00:13:21.153]  That they are incrementally bringing you into this system.
[00:13:21.153 --> 00:13:25.815]  And that we need men and women to be leaders and educate themselves and say no.
[00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:32.559]  We have thousands and thousands of scientists and virologists and geneticists and doctors and nurses that thousands have gone public.
[00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.060]  I know I'm saying this is a nightmare.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.880]  This is death.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.621]  This is insane.
[00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.461]  This has got to be stopped.
[00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:39.668]  And then on the other side, what protects you?
[00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:44.551]  The vitamins, the minerals, the D3, the zinc, the C. Oh, they don't want that known.
[00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:51.376]  Oh, the FBI raids doctors that are telling their patients to protect yourselves with vitamin C. Well, the U.N.
[00:13:51.376 --> 00:13:54.558]  didn't say you could tell somebody that.
[00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:58.401]  FBI, G-Man with machine guns!
[00:13:58.401 --> 00:14:01.723]  Because you're gonna take your death shot.
[00:14:02.364 --> 00:14:11.871]  You're gonna take it and you're gonna develop cancer and the FBI's gonna be there to make sure you and your children die and never speak up too much while you're dying.
[00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:15.613]  It doesn't matter if India bans the mRNA Pfizer.
[00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:16.814]  Oh, remember the big fact check?
[00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.435]  Guys print that for me.
[00:14:18.435 --> 00:14:19.236]  Oh, actually I did.
[00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:20.677]  I printed it myself this morning.
[00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:21.978]  I forgot it was right over here.
[00:14:21.978 --> 00:14:23.759]  This didn't age too well, did it?
[00:14:24.938 --> 00:14:27.259]  This didn't age too well a few weeks ago.
[00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:41.067]  February 20th, Newsweek fact check claims India vaccine ban mostly false while admitting de facto ban says Alex Jones is a liar and then admits it's sponsored by Bill Gates, who's banned in India.
[00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:42.088]  Remember that?
[00:14:42.088 --> 00:14:43.989]  Oh, and now here we are a month later.
[00:14:45.194 --> 00:14:46.895]  That's a little less than a month later.
[00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:58.998]  Here we are, three weeks later, and it's been banned in more countries than some of the other vaccines, because they're not... But see, it's America under China's attack, under global's attack, so we're gonna take it!
[00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:11.202]  And your 501c3 devil churches are gonna tell you to have a passcode to come in, and a QR code, and you gotta have the shot, the mark of the beast, to sit there while that devil preacher, probably a big fat pedophile,
[00:15:11.782 --> 00:15:28.250]  He sits there and tells you to submit to everything because the pedophile-in-chief, the zombie-in-chief, the walking undead monster demon, Lord Joseph Biden Sesso!
[00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.430]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.371]  I haven't even hit the vaccine news yet.
[00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:34.293]  There's just so much to cover.
[00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:35.053]  So much to hit.
[00:15:36.175 --> 00:15:37.616]  So much to break down today.
[00:15:37.616 --> 00:15:39.798]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:41.079]  You might want to warn people about this.
[00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:41.799]  You might want to blow the whistle.
[00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:46.043]  You might want to spread the links while you still can to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:47.544]  Has everybody figured it out yet?
[00:15:47.544 --> 00:15:51.067]  I was just reading their documents before they were public, before they were promoted.
[00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:52.808]  Now it's all out in the open, baby!
[00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:55.430]  You're all Alex Jones now, or you're all Bill Gates.
[00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.892]  Queues aside.
[00:15:57.892 --> 00:16:00.274]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:16:00.274 --> 00:16:02.015]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:04.257]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:06.216]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:07.156]  But I don't care about that.
[00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:09.198]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:13.921]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:17.263]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:16:17.263 --> 00:16:18.784]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:19.984]  But let's just say this.
[00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:21.285]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:23.747]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:16:24.387 --> 00:16:28.029]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.590]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.791]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:34.631]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:35.752]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:16:35.752 --> 00:16:42.194]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:16:42.194 --> 00:16:43.915]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:46.756]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:16:47.336 --> 00:16:50.457]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:16:50.457 --> 00:16:58.179]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:16:58.179 --> 00:17:06.461]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you're having trouble sleeping.
[00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:07.322]  It is Down and Out.
[00:17:07.322 --> 00:17:08.662]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[00:17:09.122 --> 00:17:12.124]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[00:17:12.124 --> 00:17:15.166]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:17.748]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[00:17:17.748 --> 00:17:21.390]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.413]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:29.015]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:32.077]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:33.958]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[00:17:34.438 --> 00:17:36.941]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:38.923]  Talk about blasting off to sleep, it's incredible.
[00:17:38.923 --> 00:17:43.928]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest that's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:20.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:22.775]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:24.356]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:18:24.356 --> 00:18:26.037]  This is the broadcast that
[00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:32.334]  David Rockefeller hated while he was alive.
[00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:40.200]  It's the broadcast that Ted Turner and Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and all the eugenicists, Nazis, all the race baiters cannot stand.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.583]  We are on air, thanks to you, and I'm very, very thankful.
[00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:54.771]  Next segment, I'm going to hit the science, the facts, the breaking news, directly linking the mRNA vaccines to turning off your cells so that they develop cancer.
[00:18:55.313 --> 00:19:00.616]  And that's why you notice they tell you, hey, you get lumps all over your body, lumps in your uterus, your lymph nodes get really, really sick.
[00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:02.497]  When you take this, don't worry about it.
[00:19:02.497 --> 00:19:03.517]  You don't have cancer.
[00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:09.861]  Because normally, a doctor would tell you you had lymphatic cancer with the symptoms that you get.
[00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:15.944]  Well, we happen to have major scientific institutes and universities saying that this actually is giving you cancer.
[00:19:16.658 --> 00:19:17.919]  You're like, why would they do this?
[00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:19.301]  Well, they've got to get rid of us.
[00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:20.983]  They've been testing so far.
[00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:24.466]  They don't just shoot up poor people and black people and third world people.
[00:19:24.466 --> 00:19:25.908]  They want to kill everybody.
[00:19:25.908 --> 00:19:29.151]  But they want to kill you in a year, six years, ten years.
[00:19:29.151 --> 00:19:30.393]  Every person is different.
[00:19:30.393 --> 00:19:32.955]  And then they'll just claim it's something else causing it.
[00:19:32.955 --> 00:19:35.258]  It's called a soft kill weapon.
[00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:39.284]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:19:39.284 --> 00:19:42.286]  There's Pentagon papers on that if you'd like to go look that up.
[00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:48.992]  But here's the Wall Street Journal last year looking forward to the end of humanity, saying humanity will be exterminated.
[00:19:48.992 --> 00:19:52.235]  It is a wonderful, good, loving thing.
[00:19:52.235 --> 00:20:02.063]  And again today it's in Politico celebrating that we will have no more children by 2045 unless they're genetically engineered and just saying it's so good.
[00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:04.425]  And that chemicals are making the boys all effeminate.
[00:20:05.426 --> 00:20:09.648]  And that the girls are getting cancer, and it's just fun and it's good because we're all bad.
[00:20:09.648 --> 00:20:16.411]  Okay, so we're going to be getting into all of that, but let me read you this first.
[00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:22.474]  I meant to cover this yesterday, and since I didn't cover it, I said, well let me just send it to a bunch of national talk show hosts I like.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.362]  And I sent it off to some folks, and I got some good responses back, and they said, yeah, we're going to definitely look into this and use this.
[00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:33.124]  And so one great talk show host said, I'm going to steal this from you.
[00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:35.705]  I said, well, you can't steal it from me, because it's the truth.
[00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:37.325]  And I didn't write it.
[00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:49.490]  Irishman1776 did, in the video I did Sunday about Marvelous Marvin Hagler dying, his organs liquefying, sadly, one day after he took the mRNA
[00:20:50.638 --> 00:20:51.618]  Vaccine.
[00:20:51.618 --> 00:20:53.319]  Similar to what happened to Hank Aaron.
[00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:57.520]  So if we can put up the live show feed name of the broadcast today.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.720]  Well, we'll go to that in a moment.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.441]  It's on InfoWars.com, the live show feed.
[00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.362]  There it is.
[00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:08.523]  Politico celebrates end of humanity, total sterilization by 2045.
[00:21:08.523 --> 00:21:11.544]  Wow, that's quite a headline.
[00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:16.392]  Top scientists directly link mRNA vaccines to infertility in women.
[00:21:16.392 --> 00:21:18.014]  Of course we should add cancer.
[00:21:18.014 --> 00:21:27.083]  Also top vaccine scientist warns world to hold all COVID vaccines immediately or uncontrollable monster quote will be unleashed.
[00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:33.370]  Now let's go ahead and read what Irishman 1776 said and the reason I put the headline of the show up
[00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:51.410]  Because we're going to add what the Irishman, 1776, said, and you can read this, it's all true, it's all public information, it's prima facie, on its face, and we're going to post what he said in the live show feed of the broadcast today, where Politico is celebrating the end of humanity.
[00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.913]  So you can share this, because a lot of the crew saw this this morning and said, you know,
[00:21:55.609 --> 00:21:57.210]  I'm going to give this to my family.
[00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:03.472]  What would happen if you went to m4wars.com and copied it, put it in email and told other people to share it, and pay it forward?
[00:22:03.472 --> 00:22:07.954]  We might actually turn around this globalist extermination operation.
[00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:09.814]  Which again, they claim is to save the Earth.
[00:22:09.814 --> 00:22:13.476]  The truth is they want to take the Earth over, play God, merge the machines.
[00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:17.357]  If we continue to move forward, we will develop technologies we have that are clean and good.
[00:22:17.357 --> 00:22:18.518]  We'll go interstellar.
[00:22:18.518 --> 00:22:20.778]  They're trying to stop that.
[00:22:20.778 --> 00:22:23.459]  But let's read what the Irishman, 1776, said.
[00:22:25.825 --> 00:22:30.729]  Here are 12 important questions and answers before considering getting vaccinated.
[00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:34.111]  If I get vaccinated, can I stop wearing a mask?
[00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:35.172]  Government, no.
[00:22:35.172 --> 00:22:36.733]  That's all true.
[00:22:36.733 --> 00:22:40.996]  If I get vaccinated, will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons, etc.
[00:22:40.996 --> 00:22:44.098]  reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal?
[00:22:44.098 --> 00:22:48.161]  Government, no.
[00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.524]  If I get vaccinated, will I be resistant to COVID?
[00:22:51.524 --> 00:22:52.405]  Government, maybe.
[00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:54.166]  We don't know exactly, but probably not.
[00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:58.454]  If I get vaccinated, at least I won't be contagious to others, right?
[00:22:58.454 --> 00:22:59.454]  Government, no.
[00:22:59.454 --> 00:23:01.955]  The vaccine doesn't stop transmission.
[00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:04.776]  If I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?
[00:23:04.776 --> 00:23:05.417]  Government.
[00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:06.237]  No one knows.
[00:23:06.237 --> 00:23:08.978]  All COVID vaccines are still in the experimental stage.
[00:23:08.978 --> 00:23:12.580]  Yeah, Pfizer just published to its shareholders that it's never going to work.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.741]  You'll get five shots a year, as Gates said last year.
[00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:15.381]  It's all planned.
[00:23:15.381 --> 00:23:18.102]  They're just rolling it out now.
[00:23:18.102 --> 00:23:20.944]  And that it's a common cold, so they can never defeat it, which is great.
[00:23:20.944 --> 00:23:22.384]  It's an enemy they can't ever stop.
[00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:23.665]  It's an endless war on you.
[00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.904]  If I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?
[00:23:26.904 --> 00:23:28.225]  Government, no.
[00:23:28.225 --> 00:23:32.288]  If my parents, grandparents, and myself all get vaccinated, can we hug each other again?
[00:23:32.288 --> 00:23:33.669]  Government, no.
[00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:35.331]  So what's the benefit of getting vaccinated?
[00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:38.053]  Government, hoping that the virus won't kill you.
[00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:41.536]  Are you sure the vaccine won't injure or kill me?
[00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:43.898]  Government, no.
[00:23:43.898 --> 00:23:46.079]  If statistically the virus won't kill me, 99.7% survival rate,
[00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:50.463]  Why should I get vaccinated?
[00:23:50.463 --> 00:23:52.465]  Government, to protect others.
[00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:56.709]  So if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with?
[00:23:56.709 --> 00:23:57.530]  No.
[00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.173]  By the way, it's way lower than 99.7.
[00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:07.779]  That's if you actually contract it and got it, which only 1-10-1% even get it, then you'd have a 99.7% survival rate.
[00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:10.061]  It's even lower than that.
[00:24:10.061 --> 00:24:13.084]  So if I get vaccinated, can I protect 100% of people I come in contact with?
[00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:13.605]  Government, no.
[00:24:15.035 --> 00:24:24.718]  If I experience a severe adverse reaction, long-term effects still unknown, or die from the vaccine, will I or my family be compensated from the government vaccine manufacturer or the government?
[00:24:24.718 --> 00:24:25.078]  Government?
[00:24:25.078 --> 00:24:25.578]  No!
[00:24:25.578 --> 00:24:30.499]  The government and vaccine manufacturers have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental drug.
[00:24:30.499 --> 00:24:31.840]  They gave it to themselves.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.060]  So to summarize, the government...
[00:24:33.999 --> 00:24:53.537]  Controlled, globalist push, COVID-19 vaccine does not provide immunity, does not eliminate the virus, does not prevent death, does not guarantee you won't get it, does not stop you from passing it on to others, does not eliminate the need for travel bans, does not eliminate the need for business closures, and does not eliminate the need for lockdowns.
[00:24:53.537 --> 00:24:57.121]  It is a total, gigantic, complete, galactic fraud.
[00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:58.710]  And there it is.
[00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:06.495]  We'll take this live segment later and add it to the page at Bandot Video and the live show feed so you can share this video of the breakdown.
[00:25:06.495 --> 00:25:15.779]  But I suggest you just share the text of it now at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com in the live show feed with everyone you know and this live link.
[00:25:15.779 --> 00:25:18.441]  Or roll over and die.
[00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:20.242]  Separately, we only have two days left.
[00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:22.283]  It will end on Thursday morning.

[00:26:38.582 --> 00:26:41.424]  That'll be our new big sale, because we got a big shipment of that in.
[00:26:42.228 --> 00:26:45.651]  At InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139, you can order.
[00:26:45.651 --> 00:26:48.974]  And when we come back, the public plan to murder you and your family.
[00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:49.775]  Now, all public.
[00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:51.176]  Everything I told you, now completely public.
[00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:57.261]  Stay with us.
[00:26:57.261 --> 00:27:04.607]  I'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes Infowars has had.
[00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:07.870]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:08.631]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:17.830]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they're trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.231]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[00:27:20.231 --> 00:27:25.854]  So, now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[00:27:25.854 --> 00:27:29.016]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:31.777]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[00:27:31.777 --> 00:27:35.059]  The power structure is going to silence those of us that they can.
[00:27:36.138 --> 00:27:40.759]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:42.460]  We have the power.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.801]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:52.323]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:53.483]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[00:27:58.383 --> 00:28:06.628]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[00:28:06.628 --> 00:28:12.652]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:21.538]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:22.779]  And it really does come down to that.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:31.393]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[00:28:31.393 --> 00:28:35.019]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:37.263]  God is the author of us having free will.
[00:28:37.944 --> 00:28:40.585]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:45.526]  And when you look at mainstream media and Hollywood and this whole evil culture and Washington D.C.
[00:28:45.526 --> 00:28:50.588]  and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[00:28:50.588 --> 00:28:53.429]  It's all about telling you you're dirty and you're ugly and you're bad.
[00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:57.970]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.171]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air.
[00:29:02.438 --> 00:29:05.299]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:14.322]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:16.082]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[00:29:16.082 --> 00:29:16.883]  They play God.
[00:29:16.883 --> 00:29:21.504]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:24.565]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[00:29:24.565 --> 00:29:26.005]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[00:29:26.005 --> 00:29:27.846]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.220]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.002]  I have a connection with God.
[00:29:32.002 --> 00:29:35.466]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[00:29:35.466 --> 00:29:44.276]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power over it.
[00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:49.101]  Whether you're just a steelworker, or a schoolteacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:56.351]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[00:29:56.351 --> 00:30:00.215]  And that's a fact.
[00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:05.920]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.765]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[00:30:12.765 --> 00:30:14.427]  With or without a battery.
[00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:21.298]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:22.159]  Excellent.
[00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:27.743]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:30.765]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:30:32.346 --> 00:30:43.111]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[00:30:43.111 --> 00:30:48.033]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[00:30:48.033 --> 00:30:53.936]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.

[00:31:00.968 --> 00:31:03.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:30.507 --> 00:31:36.933]  I mean, you know this drunk is... But still stumbling forward, more blood.
[00:31:36.933 --> 00:31:39.716]  As he falls down, they go, our God must be lifted back up.
[00:31:39.716 --> 00:31:41.758]  And more blood!
[00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:50.494]  Sell the baby parts.
[00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:53.476]  Arrest the reporters that expose we're keeping babies alive.
[00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:55.618]  Eat the hospitals with their bodies.
[00:31:55.618 --> 00:31:59.942]  Have the Pepsi taste testing systems be based on fetal tissue.
[00:31:59.942 --> 00:32:03.224]  All demonic systems genetically engineer all the crops.
[00:32:03.224 --> 00:32:04.406]  Overthrow creation.
[00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:07.728]  More blood.
[00:32:07.728 --> 00:32:15.095]  That's the good old Alex Jones channeling.
[00:32:15.951 --> 00:32:21.875]  The spirit of the world can dial right into it.
[00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:22.476]  You can too.
[00:32:22.476 --> 00:32:27.119]  That's why you gotta have God and the Holy Spirit to block it.
[00:32:27.119 --> 00:32:30.402]  And that's why so many people are now resonating with just that.
[00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:33.824]  Energy destroy and kill and overthrow creation.
[00:32:33.824 --> 00:32:42.030]  I'm gonna break more of it down as Politico and everybody announces the end of humanity and they celebrate no more children within the next two decades, three decades.
[00:32:42.782 --> 00:32:44.603]  You're like, why are they saying this all openly?
[00:32:44.603 --> 00:32:46.143]  Why are they attacking our children?
[00:32:46.143 --> 00:32:47.844]  Why are they so satanic?
[00:32:47.844 --> 00:32:49.584]  Because they're dialed into the transmission.
[00:32:49.584 --> 00:33:06.950]  Now, here is a report I did, or a group of reports, 11 years ago in 2010, laying out the Rockefeller Foundation plan to sterilize you through vaccines, which they said they would claim were antiviral and anti-cancer.
[00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.651]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:33:08.651 --> 00:33:09.111]  Here it is.
[00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:20.749]  In its 1968 yearly report, the Rockefeller Foundation acknowledged funding the development of so-called anti-fertility vaccines and the implementation of mass scale.
[00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:33.959]  From page 51 onward we read, and remember, Bill, one of Bill Gates' uncles, Bill Gates' dad, headed up Planned Parenthood, they worked for the Rockefellers, we've confirmed that.
[00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:40.884]  And this hundred plus billion that these 40 billionaires have put in, 38 billion from the Gateses, 38 billion from Buffett,
[00:33:42.503 --> 00:33:44.845]  Some more billions added by these other billionaires.
[00:33:44.845 --> 00:33:49.668]  The Rockefeller Foundation is running this, and remember the Times of London headline.
[00:33:49.668 --> 00:33:54.392]  Billionaires meet in secret to plan population control.
[00:33:54.392 --> 00:33:57.454]  Population reduction.
[00:33:57.454 --> 00:34:00.876]  And at the end of the article it talks about a world government to carry this out.
[00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:02.838]  What does eco-science cover?
[00:34:05.274 --> 00:34:12.040]  And it says, several types of drugs are known to diminish male fertility, but those have been tested have serious problems with toxicity.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:20.246]  Yeah, Bisfenol A. Rockefeller Foundation developed vaccines for mass scale fertility reduction.
[00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:27.292]  Now, the media is going to tell you how much they love you and how they love your La Infasora and your La Reconquista.
[00:34:27.292 --> 00:34:31.615]  It's just because they want to destroy the United States and drive down the wages.
[00:34:31.615 --> 00:34:33.557]  Do you actually want to read about how they want to kill you?
[00:34:34.858 --> 00:34:37.019]  Maybe some of you do, maybe some of you don't.
[00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:40.562]  Maybe it feels too good to be murdered slowly by the globalists.
[00:34:40.562 --> 00:34:41.682]  Okay.
[00:34:41.682 --> 00:34:45.565]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:58.652]  They go on to say, using vaccines to reduce male fertility was something that needed to be investigated further, according to Rockefeller Foundation, because both the oral pill and the IUD were not sustainable for mass-scale distribution.
[00:34:58.652 --> 00:35:00.894]  And of course, they want to do it by stealth.
[00:35:00.894 --> 00:35:02.355]  Oh, get your flu shot.
[00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:02.695]  Oh!
[00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:06.703]  You know, half of you'll never have kids, the other half shall have reduced.
[00:35:06.703 --> 00:35:07.824]  See, it's got to be soft kill.
[00:35:07.824 --> 00:35:11.829]  It can't hit everybody or be too noticeable.
[00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:14.532]  But they're testing how much they can get away with right now.
[00:35:14.532 --> 00:35:23.643]  We are faced with the danger within the next few years, these two modern methods, for which such high hopes have been held, will in fact turn out to be impractical on a mass scale.
[00:35:24.443 --> 00:35:33.930]  The possibility of administering hormone preparation to reduce fertility was also mentioned, although, states the report, they have been known to cause bleeding problems, which may limit their usefulness.
[00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.892]  People notice how bad it is.
[00:35:35.892 --> 00:35:48.761]  A SIMPR management or renewable subcutaneous implant of these hormones has been suggested, but whether or not the same difficulties would result has not been determined.
[00:35:48.761 --> 00:35:51.503]  And remember, they deployed all of this later.
[00:35:51.503 --> 00:35:52.024]  Saying that
[00:35:52.657 --> 00:35:57.059]  Research thus far has been too low-grade to produce any sustainable results.
[00:35:57.059 --> 00:36:00.541]  The report was adamant.
[00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:05.464]  The Foundation will endeavor to assist in filling this important gap in several ways.
[00:36:05.464 --> 00:36:20.912]  Seeking out and encouraging the development of and providing partial support to a few centers of excellence in universities and research institutes in the United States and abroad in which the methods and points of view of molecular biology are teamed with the more traditional approaches of
[00:36:22.521 --> 00:36:31.024]  Embryology, endocrinology, and research pertinent to the development of fertility control methods.
[00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:33.345]  Yeah, they want to hit those babies in the womb.
[00:36:33.345 --> 00:36:37.487]  Kind of like the UN programs worldwide where they only want to help the pregnant women.
[00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:38.327]  They come give them shots.
[00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:40.362]  Well, there you go.
[00:36:40.362 --> 00:36:42.343]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[00:36:42.343 --> 00:36:57.148]  They tried to expunge all this off the internet, but now they failed as everyone is searching their hard drives, searching their computers, going to prisonplanet.tv that has a whole archive for free, and digging into it and sharing it with the world as we go through our own documents.
[00:36:57.148 --> 00:37:06.491]  You have State Department memorandum 200 where Kissinger said we got to kill the third world as well using chemicals in the water.
[00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:07.512]  But here we are in the year 2021,
[00:37:10.074 --> 00:37:20.819]  And they use genetically engineered vaccines to go in and turn off the gene that suppresses tumors and then you get cancer.
[00:37:20.819 --> 00:37:28.083]  They then go in and set the body to attack the protein that's in the placenta so the baby never comes to term.
[00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:37.067]  And it goes on and on and on and on over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:41.538]  So a lot of people ask, Jones, why do you get so mad?
[00:37:41.538 --> 00:37:43.479]  Sometimes, Jones, why do you drink too much?
[00:37:43.479 --> 00:37:46.041]  I'll go months not drinking, months drinking.
[00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:48.903]  It's because this gets to me, folks.
[00:37:48.903 --> 00:37:50.544]  I mean, you think I'm happy about all this?
[00:37:50.544 --> 00:37:52.626]  You think it's fun to be right about all this?
[00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:56.429]  You think it's fun to be the target when you've been exposing it, number one?
[00:37:56.429 --> 00:38:03.113]  And then the frustration of watching people go around like sheep, buying into all of this.
[00:38:03.113 --> 00:38:04.975]  You think the Texas governor's in on this?
[00:38:04.975 --> 00:38:05.015]  No.
[00:38:06.198 --> 00:38:07.759]  You think Joe Biden's even in on this?
[00:38:07.759 --> 00:38:08.099]  No.
[00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:09.560]  Joe Biden does what he's told.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.861]  It's the Rockefellers, it's the Rothschilds, it's the globalists.
[00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:17.003]  And Bill Gates works directly under the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:25.887]  Operation Lockstep was Event 201, was Operation Crimson Contagion, which I will cover tomorrow.
[00:38:26.548 --> 00:38:28.109]  It's just so complex and so important.
[00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:33.230]  I procrastinated on it because I wanted to read hundreds of pages of stuff on it, and I've gone over it.
[00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.611]  But guys, give me the folder on Crimson Contagion.
[00:38:35.611 --> 00:38:39.832]  I want to make sure that we hit that tomorrow because that's so critical.
[00:38:39.832 --> 00:38:46.534]  And I'm going to open the phones up for much of the show tomorrow for medical workers to call in unfiltered and tell us what you see happening with the COVID vaccine.
[00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:47.394]  Oh, first call!
[00:38:47.394 --> 00:38:48.175]  I'm a medical doctor.
[00:38:48.175 --> 00:38:49.535]  22 of my patients died of vertigin.
[00:38:51.798 --> 00:38:52.799]  It's not just him saying that.
[00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:54.400]  I've got all the articles right here.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.465]  This is conditioning us to accept mass death.
[00:38:59.465 --> 00:39:04.809]  And so there's the Rockefellers in the 60s going, we need to sterilize people.
[00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:11.815]  Well now they've learned fertility is so strong, unless you remove the sexual organs, it's best just to kill people.
[00:39:11.815 --> 00:39:16.239]  That's why Brzezinski, before he died, gave that speech to the CFR in Canada, their CFR, and said,
[00:39:18.326 --> 00:39:24.568]  It is now much easier instead of propagandizing a million people to kill a million people.
[00:39:24.568 --> 00:39:27.189]  We have passed the point of being able to convince them.
[00:39:27.189 --> 00:39:30.410]  Now it is time to kill them.
[00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.351]  His daughter is married to Psycho Joe.
[00:39:33.351 --> 00:39:36.752]  He's not being found with dead interns with their brains bashed out.
[00:39:36.752 --> 00:39:39.513]  He's up there calling for forced inoculations.
[00:39:39.513 --> 00:39:41.494]  Know your enemy.
[00:39:41.494 --> 00:39:43.115]  You know I just quoted Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:45.155]  Go look it up.
[00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:47.056]  It is time to move forward against them.
[00:39:47.697 --> 00:39:49.879]  There is no convincing them now.
[00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:53.743]  It is easier to kill them.
[00:39:53.743 --> 00:39:54.423]  And he goes on.
[00:39:54.423 --> 00:39:56.205]  It would be good to convince them.
[00:39:56.205 --> 00:39:59.207]  You will not win this fight.
[00:39:59.207 --> 00:40:02.350]  Only killing them will work now.
[00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.453]  And we're just supposed to go, oh, okay.
[00:40:05.453 --> 00:40:13.861]  I have like the... Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:16.031]  They all call me up.
[00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:19.253]  They go, what do you mean that this is violent?
[00:40:19.253 --> 00:40:23.955]  The vaccines, people have a right to defend themselves against a overt offensive assault.
[00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:25.356]  Are you calling for people to be violent?
[00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.697]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:27.697 --> 00:40:31.959]  I think we should be given experimental vaccines and forced to do it and watch people die in mass.
[00:40:31.959 --> 00:40:33.420]  I'm glad Hank Aaron's dead.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.341]  I'm glad Marvelous Marvin Hagler's dead.
[00:40:35.341 --> 00:40:38.823]  I'm glad nursing homes, up to 10% of the people are dead from it.
[00:40:38.823 --> 00:40:39.663]  It's wonderful.
[00:40:39.663 --> 00:40:40.604]  You're good people.
[00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:44.586]  Hell, look at you right here, telling us you're killing us in the Wall Street Journal and Politico.
[00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:48.588]  Thank you!
[00:40:48.588 --> 00:40:53.110]  No, I think, I think, I think Bill Gates has a right to kill every damn one of us.
[00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:55.351]  Anybody that stands in his way should be killed by the FBI.
[00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:00.855]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[00:41:00.855 --> 00:41:05.399]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:14.629]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:41:14.629 --> 00:41:18.753]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:41:19.053 --> 00:41:36.586]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:41:37.186 --> 00:41:53.016]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:41:53.016 --> 00:41:56.879]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[00:41:56.879 --> 00:42:00.521]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[00:42:02.518 --> 00:42:05.801]  But world government is only the control grid.
[00:42:05.801 --> 00:42:13.348]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[00:42:13.348 --> 00:42:20.374]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:22.616]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[00:42:22.616 --> 00:42:26.360]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.561]  They are playing God.
[00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:38.085]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[00:42:38.085 --> 00:42:43.387]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[00:42:43.387 --> 00:42:45.829]  You have been warned.
[00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:50.290]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.872]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[00:42:53.872 --> 00:42:56.313]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[00:42:58.667 --> 00:42:59.848]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:08.255]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:10.297]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:14.221]  They're like, oh no, it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible.
[00:43:14.221 --> 00:43:17.684]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[00:43:17.684 --> 00:43:22.568]  The global government, the new world order, and now the people woke up to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[00:43:23.306 --> 00:43:25.292]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[00:43:25.292 --> 00:43:31.370]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.391]  We pay the most money in the world.
[00:43:33.391 --> 00:43:36.992]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[00:43:36.992 --> 00:43:40.173]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[00:43:40.173 --> 00:43:41.334]  Energy costs, everything else.
[00:43:41.334 --> 00:43:52.539]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate, where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[00:43:52.539 --> 00:43:53.979]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[00:43:53.979 --> 00:43:55.940]  The swamp is deep.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.721]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[00:43:59.278 --> 00:44:14.009]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[00:44:14.649 --> 00:44:22.834]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[00:44:22.834 --> 00:44:34.942]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[00:44:35.282 --> 00:44:43.528]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic, and that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[00:44:43.528 --> 00:44:51.915]  So don't worship the Globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[00:44:51.915 --> 00:45:00.982]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it, while you still have it.
[00:45:00.982 --> 00:45:03.644]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:32.603]  We are back live, and we're not gonna die in the ditch on our knees licking Bubba's boots.
[00:45:32.603 --> 00:45:39.467]  We're gonna win and fight on our feet!
[00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:41.488]  What a time to be alive!
[00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:45.650]  The enemy's gone from beta to their attack.
[00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:55.275]  And I'm very proud of the Alex Jones broadcast, which isn't just Alex Jones, it's this great crew, it's our affiliates, it's our sponsors, it's the listeners, it's the people that pray for this transmission.
[00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.451]  So I mentioned all of this, and if you think I'm kidding, you've got to go read it for yourself.
[00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:06.292]  There's a whole bunch of news articles out today that dovetail the ones that came out last year in establishment publications.
[00:46:06.292 --> 00:46:15.374]  And when you look at who Elaine Shatner is, and when you look at who Adam Kirsch is, all these people are globalists.
[00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:21.455]  It's like the guy that had the big article in the NBC News saying, we'll get rid of all humans by law, emerge the machines, humans are evil.
[00:46:23.522 --> 00:46:26.404]  Well, you know, he's a top globalist that wants to depopulate people as well.
[00:46:26.404 --> 00:46:37.010]  So it's all the same crew creating the dystopia, making you as depressed as possible, that's their main mission, and then saying, we're looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:40.052]  But here's the latest out of Politico.
[00:46:40.052 --> 00:46:41.372]  No more babies!
[00:46:41.372 --> 00:46:45.815]  The hormone-altering chemicals threatening human procreation.
[00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:48.332]  Oh, gosh, they're on our side.
[00:46:48.332 --> 00:46:49.593]  Wait till you read more.
[00:46:49.593 --> 00:46:53.778]  Sperm counts are set to reach zero in 2045.
[00:46:53.778 --> 00:46:59.225]  Leading scholar Shana Shawn says, there's a looming solution to all of humanity's problems.
[00:46:59.225 --> 00:46:59.605]  Oh, really?
[00:46:59.605 --> 00:47:00.586]  What's that?
[00:47:00.586 --> 00:47:05.372]  By 2045, most men, this is 20-something years from now,
[00:47:06.917 --> 00:47:19.785]  May no longer be able to reproduce because of the impact of hormone-affecting chemicals that it says are sterilizing amphibian life, fish life, mammal life, and confusing the sexual preference.
[00:47:19.785 --> 00:47:24.849]  And of course the media is there to say, oh, your little boy has the different chemicals in him?
[00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:26.550]  Something's happened in utero?
[00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.671]  Tell him he's a girl!
[00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:35.015]  And then we'll remove those genitals to make sure, even though we reduce their fertility and their size by 90%,
[00:47:36.664 --> 00:47:39.345]  We gave him that little micropenis.
[00:47:39.345 --> 00:47:43.468]  Now we're going to cut it completely off.
[00:47:43.468 --> 00:47:44.608]  We're not mutilators.
[00:47:44.608 --> 00:47:45.829]  We're not mad scientists.
[00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:48.310]  Just look at the Deputy Head of Health and Human Services.
[00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:54.273]  Why, he's a scary psycho dude in a wig, up there on TV talking about your five-year-old's genitals.
[00:47:54.273 --> 00:47:57.535]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, liberal.
[00:47:57.535 --> 00:47:59.356]  It's so liberal.
[00:48:00.365 --> 00:48:03.726]  They should have like a new Hellraiser movie, but in like reality have real Hellraisers.
[00:48:03.726 --> 00:48:08.288]  And as long as they say they're liberal, they should be chopping kids up and slicing necks and murdering.
[00:48:08.288 --> 00:48:10.229]  It's just like, we're here to help you.
[00:48:10.229 --> 00:48:11.510]  Your doctor's here.
[00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.970]  It's Dr. Gates.
[00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:18.173]  And as long as Pinhead wore a pink sweater.
[00:48:18.173 --> 00:48:22.475]  Can somebody in graphics put pink sweaters on the Hellraiser crew of demons?
[00:48:22.475 --> 00:48:25.676]  As long as you put a pink sweater on Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates,
[00:48:26.394 --> 00:48:36.377]  You don't notice what a demon head they are, just like a demonic black hole opening to another dimension, just wanting to rip your face off.
[00:48:36.377 --> 00:48:48.561]  But again, they're all on record wanting to depopulate the planet, but Oprah Winfrey's gonna fight the racism, oh, of the royals, when they're the whole group directing it.
[00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:49.601]  Let's continue, though.
[00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:51.762]  Yeah, just put a pink sweater on,
[00:48:52.768 --> 00:48:54.169]  That's all we need.
[00:48:54.169 --> 00:48:55.070]  And then it would be okay.
[00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.232]  Well, then you can have Penhead babysit your children.
[00:48:58.232 --> 00:49:00.374]  I'm here for your children's future.
[00:49:00.374 --> 00:49:01.715]  I want the genitals.
[00:49:01.715 --> 00:49:02.716]  Oh, thank you!
[00:49:02.716 --> 00:49:04.457]  We'll have our children sit in your lap.
[00:49:04.457 --> 00:49:05.798]  You know, this guy isn't scary.
[00:49:05.798 --> 00:49:08.000]  Let's show some of the Drag Queen Story Time people.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.562]  Much scarier than Penhead.
[00:49:10.562 --> 00:49:11.242]  But it's okay.
[00:49:11.242 --> 00:49:12.343]  Pick sweater.
[00:49:12.343 --> 00:49:12.984]  There you go.
[00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.125]  Hello.
[00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:15.406]  Yeah, I want to kill everybody.
[00:49:15.406 --> 00:49:16.126]  Yeah.
[00:49:16.126 --> 00:49:18.708]  All the scientists look at the vaccine, say it'll sterilize you or kill you.
[00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:19.929]  No, big one, you have cancer.
[00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:20.290]  It's fine.
[00:49:22.551 --> 00:49:23.531]  That's liberal!
[00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:25.252]  Sorry.
[00:49:25.252 --> 00:49:26.293]  Let's continue.
[00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:34.216]  Top scientist warns that the world that halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrollable monster will be unleashed.
[00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:47.563]  We're going to have Mike Adams on about the top admitted scientist, Gert van den Bosch, who's worked at the highest levels of university science, all of it, coming out and warning the world that this is a takeover, a mass kill program.
[00:49:48.864 --> 00:50:03.354]  And again, you know, here's Politico, here's the New York Times telling you everybody's becoming sterile, that the chemicals are confusing not just the genitals, but the olfactory nerve in the nose, so that male frogs, male men are attracted to the smell of other males.
[00:50:03.354 --> 00:50:04.675]  This is all chemical warfare.
[00:50:04.675 --> 00:50:06.716]  Remember the Pentagon gay bomb?
[00:50:06.716 --> 00:50:14.982]  The plan to spray Iraqi troops with chemicals that would make them start having gay orgies they found in animal studies.
[00:50:15.689 --> 00:50:17.490]  Yes, that's how strong these chemicals are.
[00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.211]  Just type in Pentagon Planned Gay Bomb.
[00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:20.251]  You'll get BBC News.
[00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:20.892]  Just click web.
[00:50:20.892 --> 00:50:22.293]  It's an old story.
[00:50:22.293 --> 00:50:24.974]  And then they had Operation Gay Sex.
[00:50:24.974 --> 00:50:26.475]  I'm not joking.
[00:50:26.475 --> 00:50:35.159]  That was a plan to put out ideas that Saddam and Fidel Castro were gay to, quote, undermine them with their people.
[00:50:35.159 --> 00:50:36.440]  Here, I'll show you.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:41.643]  All you gotta do is type in Pentagon Planned Gay Bomb.
[00:50:42.452 --> 00:50:43.933]  Click News, and you'll get it.
[00:50:43.933 --> 00:50:47.035]  There it is, Wikipedia, the gay bomb.
[00:50:47.035 --> 00:50:48.055]  Now, let's just continue.
[00:50:48.055 --> 00:50:55.000]  So, and again, then they make it fashionable and trendy as you become sterile, as there's no one left, and as everyone dies.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.240]  What are the sperm telling us?
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:56.961]  New York Times.
[00:50:57.862 --> 00:51:07.528]  Scientists want to send 335 million seed sperm and egg samples to the moon to create a lunar Noah's Ark because they're going to exterminate us all here on Earth.
[00:51:07.528 --> 00:51:08.609]  CBS News.
[00:51:08.609 --> 00:51:17.995]  Agricultural Noah's Ark doomsday seed vault in Arctic to outlast major sea level rise in permafrost warming.
[00:51:17.995 --> 00:51:21.057]  The new New Deal has already arrived thanks to COVID.
[00:51:21.057 --> 00:51:22.298]  World government takeover.
[00:51:22.298 --> 00:51:25.080]  And here's the big article I was mentioning.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.281]  Danish Ethics Council
[00:51:27.029 --> 00:51:34.073]  recommends legal gender change for 10-year-olds that they can convince are another sex, even though they're not in the age of consent.
[00:51:34.073 --> 00:51:35.754]  Well, they can't have sex with them by law.
[00:51:35.754 --> 00:51:37.956]  They can chop their genitals off if they can convince them.
[00:51:37.956 --> 00:51:41.518]  You know, if a pervert can convince your 10-year-old to get in a van with them, they go to prison.
[00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:50.504]  But if they can be the government and send a high priest male dressed as a woman, that's not creepy at all, like a science fiction nightmare, you know, It's a Clown movie.
[00:51:50.504 --> 00:51:51.204]  No, no, no.
[00:51:51.204 --> 00:51:54.746]  Then they can actually chop them off or put them on chemicals.
[00:51:54.746 --> 00:51:55.807]  See how liberal it is?
[00:51:57.302 --> 00:51:57.702]  U.S.
[00:51:57.702 --> 00:52:02.383]  Army considers scrapping general neutral fitness test as majority of women fail.
[00:52:02.383 --> 00:52:02.843]  Oh!
[00:52:02.843 --> 00:52:03.943]  Lowering standards.
[00:52:03.943 --> 00:52:07.024]  I thought women are equal.
[00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:10.604]  Well, they're certainly not equal when it comes to physical stamina, but men can't have babies either.
[00:52:10.604 --> 00:52:15.945]  But Twitter will ban you if you say that, or if you say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:52:15.945 --> 00:52:19.826]  Now, let's continue yet again.
[00:52:19.826 --> 00:52:24.967]  In a twist, scientists find cancer drivers hiding in RNA, not DNA,
[00:52:26.653 --> 00:52:30.874]  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
[00:52:30.874 --> 00:52:36.676]  If you don't know who they are, they're one of the top four cancer research facilities on planet Earth.
[00:52:36.676 --> 00:52:37.857]  And you can read the whole article.
[00:52:37.857 --> 00:52:43.538]  I mean, if you just type in mRNA, RNA drives cancer, you'll get thousands of reports and studies.
[00:52:43.538 --> 00:52:44.859]  But this is just the one I have here.
[00:52:44.859 --> 00:52:49.260]  And this is done before the whole COVID thing, saying they cannot find where DNA is causing cancer.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.160]  It's actually not true.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.281]  It's not malfunctions you could have.
[00:52:53.281 --> 00:52:55.042]  It is viruses getting in.
[00:52:55.754 --> 00:52:58.195]  That are able to reprogram it, giving you cancer.
[00:52:58.195 --> 00:52:59.555]  Most cancer is viral.
[00:52:59.555 --> 00:53:02.256]  And what they call the vaccine is cancer.
[00:53:02.256 --> 00:53:03.716]  Is a cancer virus.
[00:53:03.716 --> 00:53:04.896]  That's what it is.
[00:53:04.896 --> 00:53:07.177]  And I've got experts coming on that later.
[00:53:07.177 --> 00:53:10.558]  So when Biden says after he defeats COVID, he's going to defeat cancer.
[00:53:10.558 --> 00:53:11.418]  Oh, yeah.
[00:53:11.418 --> 00:53:13.599]  Talk about in your face.
[00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.699]  Again, this article.
[00:53:15.699 --> 00:53:20.121]  World weighs risk of COVID Vax blood clot fears shot banned in 20 nations.
[00:53:22.398 --> 00:53:29.440]  And remember, they had all big articles that we were full of it and we were liars and we were evil and nobody banned any vaccines.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.862]  We were just lying to you, even though it was true what we said about Pfizer being banned in India.
[00:53:34.862 --> 00:53:39.564]  Well, now it's moved on to the AstraZeneca.
[00:53:39.564 --> 00:53:43.165]  Biden calls on local preachers, doctors to promote vaccines.
[00:53:43.165 --> 00:53:44.826]  Oh, yes, because they're doctors now.
[00:53:44.826 --> 00:53:47.767]  I mean, hell, you don't need Dr. Gates to do it.
[00:53:47.767 --> 00:53:50.487]  Now we have the preachers to do it.
[00:53:50.487 --> 00:53:51.928]  It's religious to take the mark.
[00:53:52.995 --> 00:53:57.620]  From our new priest, Joe, who can barely talk Biden.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:03.486]  Professor Warren's Post-Corona Society is a national obedience contest.
[00:54:03.486 --> 00:54:04.928]  Yes, it's a IQ test.
[00:54:04.928 --> 00:54:06.209]  It's a eugenics test.
[00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:08.552]  It's an obedience dog training situation.
[00:54:09.722 --> 00:54:18.149]  Oh, wait till I hit how COVID's totally destroyed our economy and China's bigger than ever and won't even ship our containers back to us because everybody's having to buy from China now because the whole world's locked down.
[00:54:18.149 --> 00:54:24.254]  This is just totally having China take over economically, all perfectly planned with precision.
[00:54:24.254 --> 00:54:29.558]  And all over the Western world, they're sending Stasi police into bars to see if you touch hands or kiss.
[00:54:29.558 --> 00:54:30.960]  Yes, this is really happening.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.981]  This is not a dystopia.
[00:54:32.981 --> 00:54:33.682]  This is reality.
[00:54:34.415 --> 00:54:37.780]  Oh, but British Airways boss calls for vaccinated travelers to fly without restrictions.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.322]  See, he's your doctor now.
[00:54:39.322 --> 00:54:44.149]  Swiss official blames future fourth wave on COVID non-vaccinated people.
[00:54:44.149 --> 00:54:45.511]  But the problem is...
[00:54:46.636 --> 00:54:59.309]  Even NPR admits COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to the evolution of coronavirus mutations, and that's what we're going to be breaking down in the third hour with a special guest, because they admit in the literature it's actually giving rise to new super strains.
[00:54:59.309 --> 00:55:05.576]  So they're using humans to incubate super strains and have the cells produce new deadly COVID viruses.
[00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:08.233]  It was a carrier, you see.
[00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:24.768]  The COVID was just a weak virus to scare everybody, something new they could own, but also based on the common cold so you could never cure it, and then they inject you as a petri dish to breed the viruses, to create proteins that turn off your cancer-fighting systems, and protein blockers that kill the placenta.
[00:55:24.768 --> 00:55:25.969]  Devastating weapon!
[00:55:25.969 --> 00:55:30.193]  Incredible feat by Lord Gates against humanity!
[00:55:30.768 --> 00:55:31.889]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:36.071]  Don't forget, we've only got two days of free shipping left store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:40.713]  And that's how we fund the operation and our great brain-boosting nootropic.
[00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:42.174]  BrainForce Plus, back in stock.
[00:55:42.174 --> 00:55:44.095]  InfoWarsTore.com, 50% off.
[00:55:44.095 --> 00:55:46.856]  Stay with us.
[00:55:46.856 --> 00:55:50.799]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[00:55:50.799 --> 00:55:53.420]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.180]  Why do you do that?
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.122]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[00:55:57.122 --> 00:55:59.143]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:08.060]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:56:08.713 --> 00:56:08.973]  Boom!
[00:56:08.973 --> 00:56:09.353]  We did it.
[00:56:09.353 --> 00:56:09.873]  It's popular.
[00:56:09.873 --> 00:56:10.634]  It's X3.
[00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:11.294]  Is it better than X2?
[00:56:11.294 --> 00:56:12.534]  You decide.
[00:56:12.534 --> 00:56:13.995]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:56:13.995 --> 00:56:19.757]  Well, now we have a compliment to Knockout, our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[00:56:19.757 --> 00:56:21.198]  And that is down and out.
[00:56:21.198 --> 00:56:22.458]  It's super strong.
[00:56:22.458 --> 00:56:24.339]  Way stronger than Knockout.
[00:56:24.339 --> 00:56:25.899]  But they don't compete with each other.
[00:56:25.899 --> 00:56:27.780]  Different strokes for different folks.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.580]  Different formulas.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.741]  And it's 40% off out of the gates.
[00:56:30.981 --> 00:56:34.523]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:56:34.523 --> 00:56:37.785]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:56:37.785 --> 00:56:40.927]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[00:56:59.022 --> 00:57:03.386]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:09.152]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local stations you're listening to as well.
[00:57:09.152 --> 00:57:20.764]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:57:21.364 --> 00:57:23.505]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:57:23.505 --> 00:57:27.607]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:57:27.607 --> 00:57:38.211]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:57:38.211 --> 00:57:47.755]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:57:47.755 --> 00:57:48.415]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:50.476 --> 00:57:53.158]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:21.577]  So, we've got permanent troops in the Capitol.
[00:58:21.577 --> 00:58:30.100]  We're told by the Democratic Party and by Biden that the military is going to go after the American people with the FBI.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:36.663]  And we're now at the Pentagon attacking Tucker Carlson when he says, hey, women can't pass the physical, so they're lowering the standards.
[00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:42.729]  And now they're going to have pregnant women flying around in the second trimester on basic combat missions.
[00:58:42.729 --> 00:58:44.690]  This is insane.
[00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:46.550]  China is the complete opposite of this.
[00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:48.671]  This is to undermine us and bring us down.
[00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:49.652]  And they want him off the air.
[00:58:49.652 --> 00:58:51.212]  The Pentagon is responding to this.
[00:58:51.212 --> 00:58:54.633]  Even Bill Maher is admitting that Tucker Carlson is right about all of this.
[00:58:54.633 --> 00:58:56.674]  But that's a day late, a dollar short.
[00:58:56.674 --> 00:58:59.075]  So Tucker wasn't intimidated by the Pentagon.
[00:58:59.955 --> 00:59:08.079]  Well it turns out when you suggest the Pentagon may be lowering the standards for troops and thus affecting our ability to successfully win wars for political reasons, they don't like it.
[00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:11.381]  But that doesn't change the fact that that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:31.290]  In December, the Defense Department signed off on 15 recommendations from its so-called Inclusion Board.
[00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:35.352]  Those recommendations are slated to be completed by the end of this month, March.
[00:59:35.352 --> 00:59:43.896]  According to the Pentagon, quote, Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller signed a memo entitled, Actions to Improve Racial and Ethnic Diversity and Inclusion in the U.S.
[00:59:43.896 --> 00:59:44.856]  Military.
[00:59:44.856 --> 00:59:49.619]  And that examined the culture of the military following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
[00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:50.079]  End quote.
[00:59:51.082 --> 00:59:59.249]  One of those recommendations was to, quote, remove aptitude test barriers that adversely impact diversity.
[00:59:59.249 --> 01:00:04.053]  Separately, the Pentagon is now reportedly considering lowering fitness standards for female recruits.
[01:00:04.053 --> 01:00:11.859]  The military had adopted a gender-neutral test that scored men and women on the same basis, the idea being they would have to fight the same wars.
[01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:18.564]  Turns out though that far more than half of the women who took the test failed it, so they apparently are ditching that.
[01:00:18.564 --> 01:00:19.285]  The question is,
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:26.748]  Whether or not this helps diversity, will it help us win wars and defend the country?
[01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.351]  Douglas MacGregor is in a good position to answer that question.
[01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:30.492]  He's a retired Army colonel.
[01:00:30.492 --> 01:00:32.274]  We're happy to have him on tonight.
[01:00:32.274 --> 01:00:34.837]  Douglas MacGregor, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:00:34.837 --> 01:00:40.864]  So, the military is doing these things and has been doing them for a long time in order to achieve political goals.
[01:00:41.582 --> 01:00:48.043]  Most of us don't see the military as a political organization, but as our last line of defense against hostile foreign powers.
[01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:54.205]  Do these changes make it more or less likely the Pentagon will be able to defend the country?
[01:00:54.205 --> 01:01:10.448]  Well, Tucker, I think the last 20 years have had a profoundly negative impact on the American military, particularly on the combat forces that have had to go through these long occupations, long deployments, without clear missions and attainable objectives.
[01:01:11.423 --> 01:01:16.566]  And as a result of this, we've also fought a very weak enemy.
[01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:21.449]  An enemy without air forces, without air defenses, without armies.
[01:01:21.449 --> 01:01:26.212]  And people reach erroneous conclusions about the nature of combat under those circumstances.
[01:01:26.212 --> 01:01:29.013]  And I think to some extent that's what's happened now.
[01:01:29.013 --> 01:01:38.759]  So that there's a readiness to accommodate PC demands from policy makers who frankly have a cocktail level of familiarity with real war.
[01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:44.835]  When otherwise, senior officers would put up much more serious resistance.
[01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:53.342]  So the answer to your question is, I think these policies are detrimental in most cases, and probably divisive.
[01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:56.945]  So the rest of the world is, of course, paying close attention to this.
[01:01:56.945 --> 01:02:01.069]  We have been the world's supreme military power for a long time.
[01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:08.395]  What is the view of our adversaries and potential adversaries of these political changes that we've made to our military?
[01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:16.954]  Well, none of our potential opponents, whether they are in the Middle East, Northeast Asia, Eastern Europe, doesn't make any difference.
[01:02:16.954 --> 01:02:17.434]  None of them.
[01:02:18.132 --> 01:02:23.253]  would even think of adopting any of these positions and policies under any circumstances.
[01:02:23.253 --> 01:02:26.854]  Yeah, so, look, here's the bottom line, the fine print.
[01:02:26.854 --> 01:02:35.055]  Everybody knows it's about ending the human military, bringing in machines, this is to sabotage our military and destroy it, and go to mechanized systems the globals control.
[01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.416]  All this is sabotage.
[01:02:36.416 --> 01:02:42.297]  Sabotage the family, sabotage the border, sabotage the dollar, ship in the fentanyl, destroy the country.
[01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:42.717]  That's it.
[01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:46.758]  Demoralize us, have us all fight over a race war, while the totally homogeneous
[01:02:48.985 --> 01:02:52.146]  Tycoms engage in giant death camps for people.
[01:02:52.146 --> 01:02:56.286]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:02:56.286 --> 01:02:59.047]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[01:02:59.047 --> 01:03:04.568]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[01:03:04.568 --> 01:03:07.048]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[01:03:07.048 --> 01:03:08.648]  Because it works.
[01:03:08.648 --> 01:03:10.649]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[01:03:10.649 --> 01:03:16.990]  So whether it's saw palmetto and other key ingredients in our prostate formula,
[01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:30.181]  Prostagard, or whether it is the super high-grade organic bottom of the B12 and Ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force, or the pure deep-earth crystal iodine on an X2,
[01:03:31.152 --> 01:03:39.316]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.997]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[01:03:40.997 --> 01:03:45.400]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWars so you can't lose.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.681]  InfoWars delivers in spades.
[01:03:47.681 --> 01:03:50.843]  Please visit InfoWarsStore.com and get the products today.
[01:03:50.843 --> 01:03:54.585]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:04:10.817 --> 01:04:18.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:37.126]  Well, I've known about Stu Peters for a while, and I've seen him on some of our other shows here on the InfoWars Network with Owen Schroyer and Tom Papert, but I wanted to get him on the program because he's really knocking it out of the park on so many cylinders.
[01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:40.236]  We've got the George Floyd trial going on.
[01:04:40.236 --> 01:04:43.778]  We've got the tens of millions of dollars given to his family.
[01:04:43.778 --> 01:04:50.564]  We've got millions of dollars being spent by the city to demonize the police officer to make sure he's convicted.
[01:04:50.564 --> 01:04:53.045]  I mean, I've never seen such a ganging up, such a piling on.
[01:04:53.045 --> 01:04:58.390]  And I don't even like what the officer did, but obviously Floyd's out of his mind, dumping fentanyl out of his pockets.
[01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:00.271]  He's begging to be on the ground.
[01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:02.473]  Now they're admitting in the autopsy he probably died of a heart attack.
[01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:08.617]  But this is the total division of the media and the Democratic Party trying to cause a race war.
[01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:14.842]  We've seen riots across the country again, we've seen burning federal buildings, but almost no coverage of it.
[01:05:14.842 --> 01:05:27.692]  So, Stu Peters is the host of the exploding Patriotically Correct Show, redvoicemedia.com, and at RealStuPeters, he's also on iHeart and a bunch of other places, and we appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:05:28.052 --> 01:05:33.717]  To cover the waterfront today, I want to get into Bill Maher admitting that political correctness is destroying the U.S.
[01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:36.100]  at China's behest, and so much more.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.082]  But why is he saying that now?
[01:05:38.082 --> 01:05:47.330]  Coming up, the inoculations, moving with experimental vaccines on newborn babies, pregnant women, even though the advisement by the companies says don't do that.
[01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.471]  What in the hell is going on there?
[01:05:48.471 --> 01:05:52.175]  So, Stu Peters, let's start out with this show trial.
[01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:59.075]  Where I see numbers, the city of Minneapolis spending twenty-something million dollars to demonize the cop?
[01:05:59.075 --> 01:06:00.756]  I mean, since when can you even do that?
[01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.957]  He should have a mistral right there.
[01:06:02.957 --> 01:06:08.101]  Twenty-something million dollars or more, I guess, to the Floyd family, and it just goes on and on.
[01:06:08.101 --> 01:06:14.526]  You would think that this guy was like Martin Luther King or something, not a fentanyl criminal.
[01:06:14.526 --> 01:06:15.687]  Again, I'm sad he's dead.
[01:06:15.687 --> 01:06:20.430]  So you really broke it down yesterday when I was watching you on The War Room with Tom Papert.
[01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:21.171]  Give us your take on it.
[01:06:22.105 --> 01:06:23.286]  Well, thanks a lot for having me.
[01:06:23.286 --> 01:06:29.371]  I mean, yeah, we're talking upwards of a hundred million dollars by the time that this thing is all said and done.
[01:06:29.371 --> 01:06:30.552]  And you nailed it.
[01:06:30.552 --> 01:06:33.694]  I mean, this is a glaring piling on, is all this is.
[01:06:33.694 --> 01:06:39.158]  The military, in a quote that you had in the last segment, is talking about the murder of George Floyd.
[01:06:39.158 --> 01:06:42.561]  We have school districts here that are setting up cry rooms and safe spaces
[01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:48.286]  For black and brown students only to be able to go and sit in and take the space that they need.
[01:06:48.286 --> 01:06:54.052]  Letters were sent home to parents so that they can process all of this in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.
[01:06:54.052 --> 01:07:00.238]  Keep in mind Derek Chauvin, nor any of the other Minneapolis police officers that were there, that were on the scene, have gone through a trial.
[01:07:01.019 --> 01:07:05.846]  So due process here is not something that we deal with in the new woke states of America.
[01:07:05.846 --> 01:07:13.596]  This is a condemnation, a demasculization, a feminization, the neutering, the castration of law enforcement officers everywhere, all over the place.
[01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.759]  The rank-and-file is no longer effective.
[01:07:15.759 --> 01:07:17.462]  Policing is a hundred percent dead.
[01:07:18.122 --> 01:07:42.994]  It's been overtaken by this liberal, woke, leftist, swamp, communist, radical, totalitarian, fascist leadership style that basically, now all law enforcement is, is the new Nazi-style brown shirts that are out here really attacking, you know, the real crime, like the peaceful and patriotic insurrectionists or Trump supporters that are being villainized and rabidly hunted down like wild animals by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or perhaps
[01:07:43.414 --> 01:07:50.663]  Maybe we should really look into who sold what food stamps at under cost, but only if you're white and only if you live in a trailer park.
[01:07:50.663 --> 01:08:01.637]  Listen, what this is, is this is the systemic rooting of placing blame on Republican conservatives.
[01:08:02.197 --> 01:08:03.658]  Patriotic Americans.
[01:08:03.658 --> 01:08:05.458]  People who enjoy freedom.
[01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:08.459]  And this is the choking out of any conservative voices.
[01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:21.024]  And all they have to do is develop this mob style, gang style, sort of muscle type frustration of the general populace to the point where you just say, I just give up.
[01:08:21.024 --> 01:08:22.464]  The guy was murdered.
[01:08:22.464 --> 01:08:29.187]  These jurors that are coming in here saying, well, I've seen little pieces of this and I've seen little pieces of that, but I don't really know a whole lot about it.
[01:08:29.187 --> 01:08:29.587]  B.S.
[01:08:30.007 --> 01:08:41.583]  There is not one place that you can go in this entire world, Alex, where somebody is not familiar with George Floyd and how he died at the hands of the racist cop Derek Chauvin.
[01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:42.764]  It's already been set up.
[01:08:42.764 --> 01:08:43.665]  He's been tried.
[01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:45.788]  He's been convicted in the court of public opinion.
[01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.930]  The rest of it is just for show.
[01:08:48.286 --> 01:08:50.008]  And we know what the endgame is.
[01:08:50.008 --> 01:08:57.295]  Authoritarians want to demonize local police so that under political threat they roll over to the left, don't prosecute crimes against the left.
[01:08:57.295 --> 01:09:04.142]  Soros has gotten hundreds of district attorneys and dozens of attorney generals, like Leticia James in New York,
[01:09:04.762 --> 01:09:12.387]  In charge, so they can carry out these crimes and then prosecute people like Roger Stone or myself for a crooked toenail.
[01:09:12.387 --> 01:09:16.049]  This is real authoritarianism and a lot of people lionize the police.
[01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:17.609]  They're good cops, they're bad cops.
[01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:19.971]  They follow the Constitution, they're good or they don't, they're bad.
[01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:21.552]  But really the police are political.
[01:09:21.552 --> 01:09:26.935]  They are rolling over in most big cities to the left and becoming their new political executioners.
[01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:28.196]  This is a real takeover.
[01:09:28.196 --> 01:09:28.776]  I mean right now,
[01:09:29.648 --> 01:09:31.370]  People look at the left, dissolving the borders.
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.911]  They look at the left, hurting the dollar.
[01:09:32.911 --> 01:09:35.313]  They look at the left, jacking up power prices.
[01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:36.995]  That's their plan for China!
[01:09:36.995 --> 01:09:40.918]  China's produced more billionaires than all countries combined in the last year.
[01:09:40.918 --> 01:09:42.440]  We are in cardiac arrest.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.661]  This has been designed.
[01:09:43.661 --> 01:09:45.442]  This is the takedown of America, in my view.
[01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:46.183]  What is your view of that?
[01:09:47.037 --> 01:09:48.318]  Well, you're exactly right.
[01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:56.503]  And, you know, what this starts with, and I want to be clear, I mean, you're right that the police have been politicized, but I think at the street level, cops are still there to do a job.
[01:09:56.503 --> 01:10:12.693]  And let's not forget, while you said that there are good cops and bad cops, there are a million, or thereabout, police officers in the United States of America who courageously go out every single day and serve the men and women of every single race, every single ethnic background.
[01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:15.835]  There is no doubt that they are the most outgunned, overwhelmed,
[01:10:16.355 --> 01:10:18.817]  Group holding the line, and most of them are great people.
[01:10:18.817 --> 01:10:27.382]  They're one of the greatest groups of people overall as a slice of society, still being professional, still being warriors against corruption and tyranny.
[01:10:27.382 --> 01:10:31.884]  And that's why the left wants to demonize them and overthrow them to become them and take them over.
[01:10:31.884 --> 01:10:40.509]  I'm just simply pointing out that the right wing, the populist, the Christians need to get in the police face in a nice way and explain what's really happening and say, we stand with you.
[01:10:40.509 --> 01:10:41.990]  Don't bow to the communist takeover.
[01:10:42.682 --> 01:10:43.102]  That's right.
[01:10:43.102 --> 01:10:44.423]  We need you here.
[01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:53.591]  And as somebody who hunted fugitives for 18 years of my adult life, chasing some of Minnesota's most wanted, most violent criminals who did not want to go to jail... That's right.
[01:10:53.591 --> 01:10:56.073]  I should have got into your background, why you know so much about this.
[01:10:56.073 --> 01:10:57.554]  Tell folks about your bounty hunter background.
[01:10:58.197 --> 01:11:05.900]  Yeah, I mean, so for 18 years I served in Florida and here in Minnesota chasing criminals all over the world that were wanted out of the state of Minnesota.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:15.864]  These are the most violent people who have perpetrated crimes against persons involving gangs, guns, drugs, rape, murder, large amounts of fentanyl and meth trafficking, manufacturing, all this kind of thing.
[01:11:15.864 --> 01:11:17.405]  These are people who don't want to go to prison.
[01:11:17.405 --> 01:11:19.225]  These are people who are being hunted by the U.S.
[01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:20.086]  Marshals, by the FBI.
[01:11:20.826 --> 01:11:23.628]  Uh, by federal task force agencies all over the place.
[01:11:23.628 --> 01:11:25.489]  These are people that don't want to go to jail.
[01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:33.734]  When I am in black and brown communities on the north side of Minneapolis, on the south side of Chicago, in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Philadelphia, and I'm looking for these bail jumpers.
[01:11:33.734 --> 01:11:37.217]  Listen, we have real conversations on the street with real black folks.
[01:11:37.217 --> 01:11:39.418]  Believe it or not, they're out there and they have a voice.
[01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:41.299]  And you ask them about the defund movement.
[01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:42.900]  Uh, what do you think about defunding the police?
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.921]  Uh, hell no.
[01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:47.363]  I lost a sister last week and a cousin last summer to gun violence.
[01:11:47.643 --> 01:11:50.804]  The real problem here is not the black and brown divide.
[01:11:50.804 --> 01:11:52.645]  And I know that you know that, Alex.
[01:11:52.645 --> 01:11:53.085]  Absolutely.
[01:11:53.085 --> 01:11:54.406]  Let's talk about this real quick.
[01:11:54.406 --> 01:11:59.028]  And we're going to talk about George Floyd next segment and get into the real race numbers, the real statistics that they're trying to suppress.
[01:11:59.028 --> 01:12:00.429]  But take Portland.
[01:12:00.429 --> 01:12:03.750]  Burning the building, huge fires, people inside.
[01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.691]  That is a hundred times bigger than what happened to the U.S.
[01:12:05.691 --> 01:12:06.371]  Capitol.
[01:12:06.371 --> 01:12:07.552]  Almost zero coverage.
[01:12:07.552 --> 01:12:11.233]  Mainstream news is like, things got a little rowdy at the courthouse.
[01:12:11.233 --> 01:12:14.735]  So again, that is what the left and the communists, with the president,
[01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:20.358]  The fake president are doing is warming this up as a threat to burn down our cities and we need to stop it now.
[01:12:20.358 --> 01:12:21.619]  How do we do that?
[01:12:21.619 --> 01:12:22.960]  And this shouldn't surprise anybody.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.783]  I mean, this is the nobody should believe a thing from the scientists to the masking to the numbers to anything that you hear in mainstream media.
[01:12:28.783 --> 01:12:29.623]  It's all fake.
[01:12:29.623 --> 01:12:30.944]  Everything that you see is fake.
[01:12:30.944 --> 01:12:34.086]  The pundits, the commentators, the experts, they're all fake.
[01:12:34.086 --> 01:12:35.146]  Everything that you see.
[01:12:35.146 --> 01:12:36.627]  And yes, they are warming it up.
[01:12:36.627 --> 01:12:38.048]  They have not been reporting on the fact.
[01:12:38.048 --> 01:12:41.390]  I mean, Randy Sutton, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas Police Department, retired.
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.351]  Uh, has been out there in Portland covering this thing at nauseam.
[01:12:44.351 --> 01:12:48.052]  Andy Noah was forced to leave the United States of America after being assaulted.
[01:12:48.052 --> 01:12:49.773]  He has now been made out to be the criminal.
[01:12:49.773 --> 01:12:52.094]  They've banned his book from being published everywhere.
[01:12:52.094 --> 01:12:55.355]  The criminals have been propped up as martyrs.
[01:12:55.355 --> 01:13:09.360]  Okay, we are legalizing crime in the United States of America and villainizing anybody who expects the protection of the police, anybody who backs or supports law enforcement, and anybody who just wants to get up every day, enjoy the sanctity of a nice quiet neighborhood, and go to work.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.863]  If you are a white, God-fearing, patriotic, Christian, conservative, specifically, you are destined for the gulags.
[01:13:15.863 --> 01:13:16.904]  You're going to hell.
[01:13:16.904 --> 01:13:17.344]  Period.
[01:13:17.344 --> 01:13:24.528]  You're the criminal, and you should watch your six, because there is not anybody at the higher ranks of law enforcement or the government that truly has your back.
[01:13:24.528 --> 01:13:30.671]  All these institutions that we were raised, Alex, trying to be taught, these are the people that we can trust, are exactly the ones that are coming after you.
[01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:35.312]  All right, syndicated talk show host, former bounty hunter Stu Peters is our guest.
[01:13:35.312 --> 01:13:43.934]  We're going to come back and zoom in on the George Floyd show trial coming up and how it's designed to have a whole new time bomb of riots and burning and all of this.
[01:13:43.934 --> 01:13:46.895]  People say, well, wow, this will make Biden really unpopular.
[01:13:46.895 --> 01:13:47.815]  They don't care.
[01:13:47.815 --> 01:13:48.976]  He stole the election.
[01:13:48.976 --> 01:13:49.976]  That's the whole point.
[01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:50.656]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:13:50.656 --> 01:13:54.597]  Stay with us.
[01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.958]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:13:56.958 --> 01:13:57.738]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:13:58.707 --> 01:14:01.690]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:02.952]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:14:02.952 --> 01:14:03.873]  But I don't care about that.
[01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:05.915]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:14:05.915 --> 01:14:10.620]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.984]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:14:13.984 --> 01:14:15.505]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:14:15.505 --> 01:14:16.687]  But let's just say this.
[01:14:16.687 --> 01:14:18.008]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:14:18.008 --> 01:14:20.471]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:14:21.091 --> 01:14:24.733]  So, please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:14:24.733 --> 01:14:25.794]  They're great products.
[01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.294]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[01:14:27.294 --> 01:14:30.496]  So, you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:14:30.496 --> 01:14:31.337]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:14:31.337 --> 01:14:32.457]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:14:32.457 --> 01:14:38.900]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.621]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:14:40.621 --> 01:14:43.463]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:14:44.043 --> 01:14:47.164]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:14:47.164 --> 01:14:54.868]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:14:54.868 --> 01:15:02.951]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we've brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:04.011]  It is Down and Out.
[01:15:04.011 --> 01:15:05.352]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[01:15:05.832 --> 01:15:08.814]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[01:15:08.814 --> 01:15:11.876]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[01:15:11.876 --> 01:15:14.438]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.
[01:15:14.438 --> 01:15:18.081]  It's got 50 milligrams of valerian root extract concentrate.
[01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:23.104]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[01:15:23.104 --> 01:15:25.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[01:15:25.706 --> 01:15:28.768]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time.
[01:15:28.768 --> 01:15:30.650]  It's liquid, so it goes right to your body fast.
[01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.633]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[01:15:33.633 --> 01:15:35.615]  Talk about blasting off to sleep, it's incredible.
[01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:40.620]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest that's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[01:15:58.189 --> 01:16:00.850]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:16:31.235 --> 01:16:31.816]  Welcome back.
[01:16:31.816 --> 01:16:40.242]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and Stu Peters, former bounty hunter turned talk show host, is kicking butt and reaching a lot of people, and his show is exploding.
[01:16:40.242 --> 01:16:44.305]  We love to see that because we are all in this together.
[01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:50.389]  The answer to censorship is more people stepping up, becoming talk show hosts, and you build it, they will come if you're telling the truth.
[01:16:50.389 --> 01:16:52.351]  If you sense my urgency, his urgency...
[01:16:53.553 --> 01:16:55.735]  This is a globalist destabilization program.
[01:16:55.735 --> 01:16:57.616]  The FBI at the top is totally corrupt.
[01:16:57.616 --> 01:17:00.379]  They're saying patriots and gun owners and Christians are terrorists.
[01:17:00.379 --> 01:17:02.120]  The Pentagon's being trained to take our guns.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.462]  General Honore's preparing a plan.
[01:17:04.462 --> 01:17:10.748]  They have all these... Press Secretary says, yes, we're going to have the CIA and military go after Trump supporters.
[01:17:10.748 --> 01:17:14.591]  And as Tucker Carlson said, well, you're only good at paying off Iranians and handing over countries.
[01:17:14.591 --> 01:17:17.633]  But seriously, they're purging the military.
[01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.734]  They're purging the police.
[01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.717]  So while they try to have the police and military come after us,
[01:17:22.358 --> 01:17:25.439]  We have to understand they're just engaged in more divide and conquer.
[01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:29.500]  These are globalists that stole the election, that are involved in a criminal takeover.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.280]  They're obviously getting ready for more race riots.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.380]  They've already triggered them.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.540]  They've already activated them.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:39.822]  And I want to ask you, because you're a smart fellow, where you see this going and how you think we should all stand up and counter it now.
[01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:45.463]  Then we'll get into their next big detonator, their next big flashpoint, the show trial of this police officer in Minnesota.
[01:17:46.591 --> 01:18:00.818]  Well, I mean, I think, first of all, you know, we cannot talk about, all these pundits are talking about 2022 and 2024 and, you know, we need to elect America first people and, you know, the conservatives and the Republican Party needs a complete revamping and all that.
[01:18:00.818 --> 01:18:01.939]  Hold on a second.
[01:18:01.939 --> 01:18:11.044]  Have we forgotten that just a few months ago in 2020, in November, an election was completely stolen from us?
[01:18:11.044 --> 01:18:11.244]  I mean,
[01:18:11.844 --> 01:18:14.927]  Seriously, we have to stop and think about that.
[01:18:14.927 --> 01:18:16.709]  This has to be addressed.
[01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:18.490]  We can't move on anywhere.
[01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:36.086]  There is never another Republican, there is never another America First conservative, there is never another person with those core values and principles that will be elected under fair circumstances or ever again if we don't address the elephant in the room, which is that this needs to be fixed right now.
[01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.587]  And how to go about doing that?
[01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.030]  I guess, Alex, I don't really know.
[01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:41.692]  I've been thinking about that.
[01:18:41.692 --> 01:18:47.358]  I think we just admit that this is a far-and-shy comeback takeover, and we get governors and coalitions to come together.
[01:18:47.358 --> 01:18:52.644]  We have commissions, and we expose it, and we get states to pass laws blocking H.R.
[01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:52.684]  1.
[01:18:52.684 --> 01:18:53.485]  We stop H.R.
[01:18:53.485 --> 01:18:57.109]  1, and I think we get really, really aggressive and really, really serious.
[01:18:57.819 --> 01:19:00.441]  I mean, they're starting this process in Arizona.
[01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:11.491]  I know that Jake Hoffman there has had some really good legislation that's got teeth in it that will make felonies, you know, out of any of this kind of nefarious activity when it comes to our elections, and I think that that's good and dandy.
[01:19:11.491 --> 01:19:12.452]  But what about this?
[01:19:12.452 --> 01:19:15.975]  What about Jovan Pulitzer not being able to get in there to Arizona?
[01:19:15.975 --> 01:19:20.018]  Why are lawmakers, including Republicans, saying, no, no, no, we don't want to audit this thing anymore?
[01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:22.441]  Why are we closing the book on it is what I'm talking about.
[01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:31.185]  That's because they know if one domino falls, and we know it's in all these states, then it legitimizes what we've said, and so that's why they won't ever let us do an audit.
[01:19:32.023 --> 01:19:40.868]  And so when I say take it back, when I say moving on to 2022 and 2024 is pointless, it doesn't matter about Donald Trump at this point because he's just one man, right?
[01:19:40.868 --> 01:19:43.709]  I mean, arguably the best president of my lifetime.
[01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:50.913]  I'm only 40 years old, but, you know, this is one person, Alex, and he's responsible for the Great Awakening, okay?
[01:19:50.913 --> 01:20:00.778]  None of us would know jack about what we know right now about how deep the cabal really goes, the roundtable faction, the globalist elitists, and how deep the swamp really is.
[01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:01.478]  I mean, he could have spent
[01:20:02.138 --> 01:20:07.480]  10 terms, 40 years in the Oval Office and not even begin to have scratched the surface on draining that thing.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.980]  And so this needs to happen literally one person at a time.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:19.423]  And I don't know what that looks like as far as the removal of these people and the purge, but the legacy of Donald Trump is what we really need to embrace.
[01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:20.683]  And that's on us.
[01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:21.923]  He can't do it anymore.
[01:20:21.923 --> 01:20:25.764]  We can't pin everything on this or waiting for the military to take control.
[01:20:25.764 --> 01:20:28.125]  I mean, for crying out loud, look at what the military is doing.
[01:20:28.485 --> 01:20:43.113]  I mean, these people are developing a gay bomb that Tanuka saw, and they're sending women in their second trimester into Mach 2 speeds over Syria as we bomb kids with drones that are named after Ghislaine Maxwell, for crying out loud.
[01:20:43.113 --> 01:20:45.014]  I mean, this is absolutely absurd.
[01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:52.718]  So counting on the military, counting on Sidney Powell or Rudy Giuliani, although be it, everybody was waiting for Lin Wood's great revelation and all that, that's great.
[01:20:52.718 --> 01:20:56.060]  And these might be really noble carriers of an actual real message.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:02.141]  But the fact is, until we actually pick up the ball and run with it, whatever that looks like... I agree.
[01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:02.481]  I agree.
[01:21:02.481 --> 01:21:04.342]  We cannot give people false hope.
[01:21:04.342 --> 01:21:07.423]  And of course, everything Q said was the opposite.
[01:21:07.423 --> 01:21:10.503]  It was the inverse of what was really going to go down.
[01:21:10.503 --> 01:21:12.064]  It's not the military that's going to save us.
[01:21:12.064 --> 01:21:12.744]  It's the truth.
[01:21:12.744 --> 01:21:13.364]  It's justice.
[01:21:13.364 --> 01:21:14.744]  It's our legislatures.
[01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:15.584]  It's our churches.
[01:21:15.584 --> 01:21:21.426]  It's us as men and women standing up and saying no to all of this and realizing this is a globalist takeover.
[01:21:21.426 --> 01:21:22.326]  I totally agree with you.
[01:21:23.081 --> 01:21:26.584]  And the PSYOP, you know, I mean, we have to be able to counter that in some way.
[01:21:26.584 --> 01:21:29.446]  And we were talking to George Floyd here in the city of Minneapolis.
[01:21:29.446 --> 01:21:32.448]  This is the next international PSYOP, is what it is.
[01:21:32.448 --> 01:21:35.330]  I mean, they've already found him guilty.
[01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.331]  This is just a part of the PSYOP.
[01:21:37.331 --> 01:21:47.079]  I mean, the march, everything, that was the last nail in the coffin by just this propaganda spreading ad nauseum on the mainstream media is just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:21:47.079 --> 01:21:47.599]  And when you think
[01:21:47.619 --> 01:21:50.724]  The message is give us what we want or we'll burn down cities.
[01:21:50.724 --> 01:21:58.496]  Then the media can inflame groups whenever they want over anything and have basically a gun to our head if we capitulate to this type of terrorism.
[01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:03.043]  The globalists, the communists dominate the country using their liberation theology.
[01:22:03.829 --> 01:22:07.653]  I mean, if anybody knows about cancellation and the threat of arrest, it's Alex Jones, right?
[01:22:07.653 --> 01:22:13.339]  I mean, look, I was targeted even as a bounty hunter by political adversaries of mine.
[01:22:13.339 --> 01:22:16.061]  People that I didn't even work for or work alongside.
[01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:24.390]  Elected sheriffs didn't like the fact that I had the authority, and even in most situations as pertaining to a warrant or a bail jumper, a greater level of authority than they did.
[01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:36.360]  And would actually try to politically step in my way under the threat of arrest and prosecution if I should go and, you know, grab somebody who raped three innocent children in Minneapolis.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:47.109]  We went to Mexico to get him, you know, and they were trying to hold the prosecution of false imprisonment and illegal extradition over my head and all these different kinds of things because they weren't the ones to go arrest him.
[01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:49.350]  You know, they say that invention
[01:22:50.473 --> 01:22:52.941]  They said that necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:22:52.941 --> 01:22:57.374]  Is that how you became a talk show host, was just to get the truth about what you'd gone through out there?
[01:22:58.163 --> 01:23:04.705]  Well, you know, I mean, I worked for Clear Channel prior to becoming a bounty hunter, and I was just a guy who introduced songs on Top 40 Radio.
[01:23:04.705 --> 01:23:07.606]  So, you know, radio is something that I've always loved.
[01:23:07.606 --> 01:23:16.129]  You know, the natural transition from bounty hunting into patriotically correct is that I'm still dealing with criminals, only now they're just elected representatives.
[01:23:16.129 --> 01:23:22.871]  And so exposing the criminals has become really easy because thinking like a criminal has been what I have had to do for the last 18 years.
[01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:25.792]  And really, all you have to look at when you think something isn't right,
[01:23:26.332 --> 01:23:32.275]  And when you trust your gut, which is how I was raised by my dad, a Vietnam War veteran, a hero in my eyes.
[01:23:32.275 --> 01:23:33.656]  And my mother, too.
[01:23:33.656 --> 01:23:35.757]  They taught me to trust your gut.
[01:23:35.757 --> 01:23:37.118]  Always go with your intuition.
[01:23:37.118 --> 01:23:38.859]  Pray to God and trust your gut.
[01:23:38.859 --> 01:23:43.862]  And when you feel like something isn't right, people, what you have to understand is that you're right about that.
[01:23:43.862 --> 01:23:47.504]  Look at yourself in the mirror physically and tell yourself, I am not crazy.
[01:23:47.504 --> 01:23:49.785]  Like, this is really going on around me.
[01:23:49.785 --> 01:23:51.526]  And that is the only way... That's key.
[01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.207]  That's why God gave us an internal compass.
[01:23:53.788 --> 01:23:56.878]  And internal navigation when we're being gaslit to know what the truth is.
[01:23:57.688 --> 01:23:58.248]  Exactly.
[01:23:58.248 --> 01:24:09.291]  And so the transition from radio into, or excuse me, bounty hunting into radio and dealing with criminals has been natural because all you have to look at is who had what to gain by committing this crime.
[01:24:09.291 --> 01:24:15.493]  And that'll open up your eyes in a completely new way when you're talking about people like the highest paid guy in our federal government, Anthony Fauci.
[01:24:15.493 --> 01:24:16.193]  He's a criminal.
[01:24:16.193 --> 01:24:17.134]  He's a liar.
[01:24:17.134 --> 01:24:25.216]  He's a personal investor in the lab in Wuhan, China, that this thing, I mean, I didn't get a call from my financial advisor saying, hey, I got a great tip on this obscure lab in Wuhan.
[01:24:25.216 --> 01:24:25.516]  Did you?
[01:24:26.252 --> 01:24:27.873]  I mean, come on.
[01:24:27.873 --> 01:24:35.339]  You know, Pfizer just sent out a prospectus to their employees and to their shareholders saying, oh, we're going to have five shots a year.
[01:24:35.339 --> 01:24:37.941]  We're going to jack up the price and we're going to take over the world.
[01:24:37.941 --> 01:24:38.901]  This is incredible.
[01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:40.082]  Let's get back into it.
[01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:46.807]  I saw you yesterday on the war room here on the InfoWars Network talking about crime statistics and the black on white crime they're trying to suppress.
[01:24:46.807 --> 01:24:50.930]  I think the truth of that is the antidote to claiming there's this false epidemic of black on white crime.
[01:24:54.042 --> 01:24:59.207]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[01:24:59.207 --> 01:25:02.250]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:11.318]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art, skill and strength.
[01:25:11.318 --> 01:25:16.703]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[01:25:17.664 --> 01:25:25.746]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:29.367]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[01:25:29.367 --> 01:25:34.208]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:35.968]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[01:25:35.968 --> 01:25:39.349]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[01:25:39.349 --> 01:25:40.909]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[01:25:41.509 --> 01:25:49.371]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[01:25:49.371 --> 01:25:50.171]  That's the facts.
[01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:53.092]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[01:25:53.092 --> 01:25:56.612]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[01:25:56.612 --> 01:26:03.634]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[01:26:03.634 --> 01:26:07.715]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team.
[01:26:08.655 --> 01:26:11.596]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[01:26:11.596 --> 01:26:18.858]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[01:26:18.858 --> 01:26:21.678]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[01:26:21.678 --> 01:26:23.999]  The enemy can't help itself.
[01:26:23.999 --> 01:26:28.060]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:32.081]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it.
[01:26:32.081 --> 01:26:32.541]  We should, but
[01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:43.513]  Once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[01:26:43.513 --> 01:26:45.655]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[01:26:45.655 --> 01:26:49.278]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[01:26:49.278 --> 01:26:50.179]  This is the truth.

[01:27:56.093 --> 01:28:00.457]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:00.457 --> 01:28:21.415]  They wanted Joe Biden in there.
[01:28:25.001 --> 01:28:36.003]  Because they know he was easily controlled, bought and paid for by Communist China, and his entire group of individuals around him are compromised, so the deep state could fully keep him on a short leash.
[01:28:36.003 --> 01:28:44.705]  But he's deteriorated so quickly now, and the things he's saying are so out of control now, I don't see what they do.
[01:28:44.705 --> 01:28:52.487]  And I want to ask our guest, Stu Peters of Red Voice Media Syndicate, the talk show host, what his take on all this is.
[01:28:52.487 --> 01:28:53.827]  And I want to get to these clips of
[01:28:56.477 --> 01:29:10.045]  The White House saying that it's Trump's fault that 4,200 children are now sleeping on the floor in cages with no sunlight, even though they're all coming wearing Biden shirts paid for by NGOs to come here.
[01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:11.266]  So this is just incredible.
[01:29:11.266 --> 01:29:12.226]  This is the whole U.N.
[01:29:12.226 --> 01:29:14.007]  invasion of the country.
[01:29:14.007 --> 01:29:17.149]  We're going to talk about that in a moment, but just finishing up with these statistics.
[01:29:18.354 --> 01:29:22.077]  Because as you said, real black folks voted for Trump in record numbers.
[01:29:22.077 --> 01:29:30.685]  But if you look at the real statistics, the media promotes attacking white people, and there is black on white racially motivated crime, and also motivated attacks on Asians.
[01:29:30.685 --> 01:29:36.650]  And in New York, when they've had attacks on Asians, they then have marches against white supremacy.
[01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:41.814]  So, the level of gaslighting has reached Mad Hatter levels here.
[01:29:41.814 --> 01:29:43.676]  And so, lay out some of those numbers.
[01:29:44.969 --> 01:29:49.551]  Well, you know, I don't have exact up-to-date numbers.
[01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:55.833]  Here's what I do have, and, you know, I only stopped chasing fugitives just weeks ago, after 18 years of doing this.
[01:29:55.833 --> 01:30:05.096]  And so it was my job, you know, in writing and staying proficient in these numbers, to understand what's really going on in every single community that we serve.
[01:30:05.096 --> 01:30:12.399]  Because regardless of whether or not we're cops, we're doing a job where we're arresting people, taking people to jail, and it's a very real probability I've been shot at.
[01:30:13.259 --> 01:30:22.123]  I mainly deal with people of color, with black folks, and I don't know why that is, but that's what the facts are.
[01:30:22.123 --> 01:30:33.968]  And the facts are that last year, when we look at the cops and the black people and this big theory of systemic racism, and I'm looking at it right here, nine unarmed black people were killed by cops last year.
[01:30:33.968 --> 01:30:34.148]  Nine.
[01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:40.032]  Nineteen white unarmed people were killed by cops last year.
[01:30:40.032 --> 01:30:44.355]  More officers are killed every single year than unarmed blacks.
[01:30:44.355 --> 01:30:47.717]  So the question is, when is the Blue Lives Matter people going to have their chance?
[01:30:47.717 --> 01:30:48.278]  Way more police are.
[01:30:48.278 --> 01:30:48.858]  Well, exactly.
[01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:50.099]  We never hear the name of dead cops.
[01:30:50.099 --> 01:30:51.160]  And here's the deal.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.082]  I'm surprised there aren't more people, period, being shot because there's mistakes made.
[01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:57.804]  I can't believe the numbers are so low.
[01:30:57.804 --> 01:31:01.367]  The police with 350 million people aren't accidentally killing more people.
[01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:09.773]  How many people, how many kids, how many kids under the age of 18 from the black community in cities like Chicago, in cities like Minneapolis?
[01:31:09.773 --> 01:31:13.736]  2,000 blacks are killed on average in Chicago, 98% of them by blacks.
[01:31:14.722 --> 01:31:18.364]  And where is Black Lives Matter on this?
[01:31:18.364 --> 01:31:36.356]  We go back to the gut feeling, we go back to the intuition that you were raised with, we go back to the common sense, the independent and individual free and critical thinking that has just gone by the wayside since the introduction of these mobile devices, these smartphones, these tablets, the information superhighway, this immediate sense of gratification.
[01:31:36.856 --> 01:31:37.997]  News is not news anymore.
[01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:40.298]  Remember, Walter Cronkite used to read the news.
[01:31:40.298 --> 01:31:49.902]  And then it was up to mom and dad at the dinner table, if you grew up that way, with both of your parents, or like me, came from a divorced home, didn't really have a whole lot, you know, financially, monetarily.
[01:31:49.902 --> 01:31:52.903]  My parents did okay, but I wasn't silver spoon fed.
[01:31:52.903 --> 01:32:00.466]  And, you know, the conversation was left to your folks or to your family at the dinner table to kind of then enter the subjection or form an opinion.
[01:32:00.466 --> 01:32:04.828]  That's what you learned about the world, your own experiences in your family, not from MSNBC.
[01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:06.715]  That's right.
[01:32:06.715 --> 01:32:14.259]  And so now, we're not only told what the news is, which isn't really even the news, but now we're even told how to interpret this news.
[01:32:14.259 --> 01:32:19.441]  And if you interpret it in any other way, now you've become a danger to society.
[01:32:19.441 --> 01:32:24.344]  Your parents could be dangerous if they don't prefer to wear a mask, for example.
[01:32:24.344 --> 01:32:28.266]  And now we're looking at the possibility, and it's actually happening in Broward County.
[01:32:28.266 --> 01:32:35.030]  A judge actually took a child away from a mother because she posted on Facebook a picture of herself donning her maskless face.
[01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:41.013]  I mean, a judge actually said, no, you're a danger to the child, and took the child away from the mother in the name of health and safety.
[01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:42.854]  And that's exactly where I was going.
[01:32:42.854 --> 01:32:50.078]  Now that you segue into that, we've got marvelous Marvin Hagler, a great part of the community, and you've got Hank Aaron, an amazing guy.
[01:32:50.078 --> 01:32:52.680]  They're both dead after they took the COVID shot.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.581]  The families say, yeah, it's the shot that killed them.
[01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:55.922]  The media tries to cover it up.
[01:32:55.922 --> 01:32:57.482]  But we have record numbers of old people.
[01:32:57.482 --> 01:32:58.943]  I had a doctor call in here yesterday.
[01:32:58.943 --> 01:32:59.524]  He's lost 22 patients.
[01:33:00.544 --> 01:33:02.205]  Because he takes care of old people that took the shot.
[01:33:02.205 --> 01:33:03.907]  Well, we see that in the news.
[01:33:03.907 --> 01:33:06.428]  20 countries just banned one of them.
[01:33:06.428 --> 01:33:08.610]  Pfizer's been banned because people are dying in India.
[01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:09.571]  This is real stuff.
[01:33:09.571 --> 01:33:11.392]  So where's Black Lives Matter there?
[01:33:11.392 --> 01:33:14.414]  Well, they're funded by George Soros and Bill Gates and others.
[01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:20.258]  So that's why they're there to cover up for the big corporations, the death camps that Apple's running in China.
[01:33:20.258 --> 01:33:25.342]  That's why they spend $100 million on Black Lives Matter to go, look, black people, look, I'm not racist.
[01:33:25.342 --> 01:33:26.623]  It's just absolutely insane.
[01:33:27.307 --> 01:33:34.474]  Black Lives Matter also funding Blue Dot, which then of course billions of dollars to the DNC, which actually then funds Planned Parenthood.
[01:33:34.474 --> 01:33:38.378]  I mean, it's no secret that these people have wanted to kill black babies for the longest time.
[01:33:38.378 --> 01:33:41.821]  I mean, they're the biggest proponents of killing black babies.
[01:33:41.821 --> 01:33:44.804]  The Democrats, the radicals... And let's be clear, LBJ said...
[01:33:44.864 --> 01:33:45.204]  I think so.
[01:34:02.797 --> 01:34:03.778]  And it's the same everywhere.
[01:34:03.778 --> 01:34:05.919]  You take dads out of the house, you get crime waves.
[01:34:05.919 --> 01:34:07.360]  And then now, that's where it is.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.004]  So this was literally engineered, ladies and gentlemen, but now we've got a crime wave out of the black community with the media saying, go out and attack white people.
[01:34:15.004 --> 01:34:23.629]  And the knockout games, the muggings, this is clearly racially motivated at a level we never even saw from the KKK, who was another terrible organization.
[01:34:24.389 --> 01:34:33.236]  When you go to the south side of Minneapolis right now, for example, they have this quote, unexplainable plague of carjackings targeting white people.
[01:34:33.236 --> 01:34:33.856]  Really?
[01:34:33.856 --> 01:34:35.057]  Is it unexplainable?
[01:34:35.057 --> 01:34:38.179]  Well, how about you just go back to exactly what you just said, Alex Jones.
[01:34:38.179 --> 01:34:42.923]  Let's go back to how many of these kids grew up in fatherless homes on the south side of Chicago.
[01:34:43.263 --> 01:34:44.564]  Why are they in Minneapolis?
[01:34:44.564 --> 01:34:47.346]  Well, could it be because Minneapolis is the welfare city?
[01:34:47.346 --> 01:34:54.372]  Could it be because Minnesota, historically and for decades, run by, I don't know why, but by liberal Democrats who just have this welfare state?
[01:34:54.372 --> 01:34:56.614]  What is the motivation to go to work?
[01:34:56.614 --> 01:35:06.942]  What is the motivation to do anything positive when they can be compensated at levels that are higher than what... And let's be clear, they defunded the police massively in Minneapolis, and then they hired private bodyguards.
[01:35:06.942 --> 01:35:08.643]  Tell folks about that for the City Council.
[01:35:09.389 --> 01:35:10.790]  Yeah, of course they did.
[01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:34.331]  And then, the same city council president, who was, defund the police, get rid of the police, take all guns away from police, we want an unarmed health and safety commission rather than the Minneapolis Police Department, is now standing in the same park, Cedarfield Park is what it's called, right there in the Longfellow neighborhood of Minneapolis, where she grabbed probably the same exact bullhorn, addressing the same exact crowd, and now yelling at the police, where are you?
[01:35:34.331 --> 01:35:35.212]  Where are the police?
[01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:36.632]  I saw that yesterday.
[01:35:36.632 --> 01:35:37.372]  It's crazy.
[01:35:37.372 --> 01:35:42.313]  She's now bitching at them saying, what is up with the left where they don't think we have a memory?
[01:35:42.313 --> 01:35:44.894]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:35:44.894 --> 01:35:51.835]  Do they think that we don't have a memory or are they just too plain stupid to remember what they said just yesterday?
[01:35:51.835 --> 01:35:53.856]  Because this is what the media is again.
[01:35:53.856 --> 01:35:55.036]  It's soundbites.
[01:35:55.036 --> 01:35:58.477]  And I was trying to articulate that before we had to go to break in the last segment.
[01:35:58.477 --> 01:36:03.358]  But we're told how to feel about stories and we don't get the full story in its context.
[01:36:03.678 --> 01:36:05.600]  You don't hear that George Floyd.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.321]  You don't look at the medical examiner's report.
[01:36:07.321 --> 01:36:10.343]  People are asking me on social media, well where are you finding this?
[01:36:10.343 --> 01:36:13.706]  And what doctor said that he died of a lethal amount of fentanyl and meth in his system?
[01:36:13.706 --> 01:36:15.287]  People, it's right there on the internet.
[01:36:15.287 --> 01:36:22.753]  The entire Hennepin County medical examiner's report that specifically says that George Floyd had no bruising in his neck area.
[01:36:22.753 --> 01:36:24.354]  He had no lacerations.
[01:36:24.354 --> 01:36:28.978]  He had no indication of blunt force trauma to the trachea or anywhere that would have affected his breathing.
[01:36:29.298 --> 01:36:33.260]  Nothing from the knee, nothing from the dragging, nothing from the putting in the squad car.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:39.824]  The only marks that he had on him that were consistent with being arrested was from hand restraints, and they were typical of hand restraints, i.e.
[01:36:39.824 --> 01:36:43.146]  handcuffs that are used to handcuff anybody that goes to jail.
[01:36:43.146 --> 01:36:45.528]  I mean, he died of a fentanyl overdose.
[01:36:45.528 --> 01:36:46.928]  He died of a fentanyl overdose.
[01:36:46.928 --> 01:36:47.829]  His heart blew up.
[01:36:47.829 --> 01:36:49.410]  He had a lethal amount of fentanyl.
[01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:52.212]  Those are words that come verbatim from the medical examiner.
[01:36:52.212 --> 01:36:54.593]  Didn't they say it was like double or triple the number that would kill somebody?
[01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:59.916]  It would have killed three people, the amount of meth and fentanyl that he had in his system.
[01:36:59.916 --> 01:37:03.981]  Whether he had contact with a cop that day or not, George Floyd was going to die.
[01:37:03.981 --> 01:37:05.043]  I just feel sorry for the police.
[01:37:05.043 --> 01:37:06.024]  I see it here in Austin.
[01:37:06.024 --> 01:37:07.306]  They're like janitors.
[01:37:07.306 --> 01:37:11.291]  They have to run around behind all these drug addicts, black, white, you name it, attacking them all day.
[01:37:11.291 --> 01:37:12.192]  I would never do that job.
[01:37:13.104 --> 01:37:15.426]  I know you just have a couple of seconds left, but let me just ask the question.
[01:37:15.426 --> 01:37:24.511]  So does this mean now that we're going to target and go after every single cop and charge them with murder if they had contact with somebody today who later today dies of a fentanyl or meth overdose?
[01:37:24.511 --> 01:37:26.212]  Did they use excessive force?
[01:37:26.212 --> 01:37:28.914]  This is designed to make society totally disintegrate.
[01:37:28.914 --> 01:37:30.535]  Stay there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:30.535 --> 01:37:31.896]  Scoot Peters is our guest.
[01:37:32.496 --> 01:37:34.938]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:37:34.938 --> 01:37:36.578]  This site's RedVoiceMedia.com.
[01:37:36.578 --> 01:37:37.719]  There's a great show daily.
[01:37:37.719 --> 01:37:44.583]  We'll be right back on the other side to talk about the inoculations, all of this, and the police state around inoculations.
[01:37:44.583 --> 01:37:45.403]  You want a police state?
[01:37:45.403 --> 01:37:46.024]  You're getting one.
[01:37:46.024 --> 01:37:46.504]  We'll be right back.
[01:37:52.316 --> 01:37:55.917]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[01:37:55.917 --> 01:38:00.459]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[01:38:00.459 --> 01:38:09.683]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:14.144]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:21.427]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon
[01:38:21.847 --> 01:38:32.274]  To then have us, under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[01:38:32.274 --> 01:38:48.105]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute, or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[01:38:48.105 --> 01:38:51.467]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the Globalist.
[01:38:52.267 --> 01:38:56.010]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:59.732]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:38:59.732 --> 01:39:02.334]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[01:39:02.995 --> 01:39:07.379]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:39:07.379 --> 01:39:13.145]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[01:39:13.145 --> 01:39:24.737]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:39:25.357 --> 01:39:27.478]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:39:27.478 --> 01:39:31.600]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:42.206]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:39:42.206 --> 01:39:51.751]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:52.391]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:54.441 --> 01:40:00.645]  Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have in stock in our warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:00.645 --> 01:40:01.806]  Every product.
[01:40:01.806 --> 01:40:05.848]  So if you order it, we've got it shipped out in a couple days, sometimes the same day.
[01:40:05.848 --> 01:40:13.053]  Leisurers get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain's breaking down and it's future orders.
[01:40:13.053 --> 01:40:17.836]  It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in that we're having trouble with.
[01:40:17.836 --> 01:40:21.198]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times.
[01:40:22.185 --> 01:40:26.909]  And it's across, not just the supplement vitamin mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[01:40:26.909 --> 01:40:30.452]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[01:40:31.647 --> 01:40:39.936]  That's why I'm saying you need to visit InfoWareStore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still can and storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:40:39.936 --> 01:40:42.379]  Because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship.
[01:40:42.379 --> 01:40:48.465]  But with the supply chain breakdowns and prices are going up, availability is going down and it's just crazy.
[01:40:48.465 --> 01:40:51.669]  So please get products while you still can and support the InfoWare.
[01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:52.630]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:55.772]  The people are awakening.
[01:40:55.772 --> 01:40:58.494]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[01:40:58.494 --> 01:41:00.556]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[01:41:00.556 --> 01:41:02.898]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[01:41:02.898 --> 01:41:09.524]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[01:41:09.844 --> 01:41:21.111]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[01:41:21.111 --> 01:41:27.855]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[01:41:27.855 --> 01:41:29.276]  In their own words, they admit it.
[01:41:29.276 --> 01:41:33.699]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[01:41:34.179 --> 01:41:36.121]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[01:41:36.121 --> 01:41:37.202]  They're Faraday cages.
[01:41:37.202 --> 01:41:38.904]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[01:41:38.904 --> 01:41:40.905]  They work absolutely great.
[01:41:40.905 --> 01:41:50.034]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[01:41:50.034 --> 01:41:56.059]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:41:56.059 --> 01:41:58.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:06.332 --> 01:42:11.263]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:42:11.263 --> 01:42:15.151]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:21.832]  We now take you live.
[01:42:21.832 --> 01:42:29.820]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:33.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:42:33.304 --> 01:42:35.366]  And Stu Peters of Red Voice Media.
[01:42:35.366 --> 01:42:37.308]  I'm Alex Jones again of InfoWars.com.
[01:42:37.308 --> 01:42:39.550]  We have Stuart Rhodes.
[01:42:40.365 --> 01:42:45.170]  Who they're trying to set up for the capital event on January 6th.
[01:42:45.170 --> 01:42:48.394]  Joining us we have Mike Adams breaking down this big side of it.
[01:42:48.394 --> 01:42:50.175]  Report at naturalnews.com.
[01:42:50.175 --> 01:42:57.944]  Top vaccine scientists warn the world halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrolled monster will be unleashed.
[01:42:57.944 --> 01:43:01.868]  But throughout history we have seen children
[01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:19.059]  By the Toltecs, and the Olmecs, and the Aztecs, and by the Babylonians, and by the Druids, and by every group goes through cycles where children give their parents over to have their hearts cut out, or to be burned, or to be skinned alive, or to be ground to different gods.
[01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:27.084]  And now we have the textbooks coming out in California teaching children to pray to the winged serpent, Quetzalcoatl, if I'm saying that wrong.
[01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:29.129]  I probably am.
[01:43:29.129 --> 01:43:31.591]  Which they would sacrifice boys to.
[01:43:31.591 --> 01:43:33.833]  And they say this is good, the earth needs blood.
[01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:36.796]  So the left is just going back to pagan ideology.
[01:43:36.796 --> 01:43:38.698]  They're very anti-Christian.
[01:43:38.698 --> 01:43:41.000]  And so here's the latest on Infowars.com.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.565]  Even though these are experimental vaccines, not even properly approved, they're just given executive power to be approved by Dr. Biden and Dr. Gates.
[01:43:47.565 --> 01:43:52.750]  Woke parents volunteering their babies and young children to test Moderna's COVID vaccine.
[01:43:53.647 --> 01:43:59.752]  It says it's liberals that are doing it in the article, and the parents are bringing their children saying they want it, they want it now.
[01:43:59.752 --> 01:44:10.581]  Even if you believe in the overblown covid hoax, that even if you contract it, 99.7% chance you get over it, but you've got a 99.99999% chance you're not going to get it.
[01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:15.625]  Children don't need this, and it's dangerous, but oh, it's a sacrament of your wokeness.
[01:44:16.764 --> 01:44:18.045]  We're on the news.
[01:44:18.045 --> 01:44:19.306]  Republicans don't believe it.
[01:44:19.306 --> 01:44:20.327]  They don't want it.
[01:44:20.327 --> 01:44:21.227]  So they want the shot.
[01:44:21.227 --> 01:44:22.288]  Republicans don't want masks.
[01:44:22.288 --> 01:44:23.929]  So we've got to have the masks forever.
[01:44:23.929 --> 01:44:28.533]  They have gotten the left to do anything they're told as long as it's like they're pro-war now.
[01:44:28.533 --> 01:44:29.753]  They're pro-torture.
[01:44:29.753 --> 01:44:31.134]  They're pro-get rid of the dollar.
[01:44:31.134 --> 01:44:32.896]  They're pro-burn the country down.
[01:44:32.896 --> 01:44:34.557]  Because they're so woke.
[01:44:34.557 --> 01:44:35.878]  What do you say about this?
[01:44:37.887 --> 01:44:41.469]  Well, I mean, I had to pick up my son today from school.
[01:44:41.469 --> 01:44:42.989]  He is nine years old.
[01:44:42.989 --> 01:44:44.370]  He's a third grader.
[01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:47.151]  He was involved with a hockey tournament over the weekend.
[01:44:47.151 --> 01:44:53.454]  And apparently one of the players in this tournament had the world ending plague, you know, the Rona.
[01:44:53.454 --> 01:45:00.137]  And by the way, we've now eliminated kids as being these super spreaders that they tried to fear us into what was going to happen.
[01:45:00.137 --> 01:45:00.277]  Right.
[01:45:02.108 --> 01:45:08.333]  I have to go pick him up, despite the fact that these kids are exerting themselves wearing masks.
[01:45:08.333 --> 01:45:11.855]  I mean, it's absolutely devastating to let them play organization.
[01:45:11.855 --> 01:45:14.317]  I don't really know a whole lot about them, but what a fright.
[01:45:14.317 --> 01:45:15.918]  So this is not an endorsement.
[01:45:15.918 --> 01:45:18.881]  But what I'm seeing from them so far, I really like.
[01:45:18.881 --> 01:45:27.267]  I mean, these kids are exerting themselves, Alex, while wearing a mask that prohibits them from exhaling what your body is designed to get rid of.
[01:45:27.267 --> 01:45:31.010]  I mean, why don't they just wrap their lips around my tailpipe every morning before I
[01:45:32.333 --> 01:45:37.960]  You know, and this carbon dioxide and this stuff, I mean, and their heart rates are elevated.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:44.888]  The long term effects that this is going to have on our children physically is
[01:45:45.723 --> 01:46:04.048]  Just absolutely a travesty, and we haven't even really talked about the unprecedented amount of youth suicides, attempted suicides, depression, the pills, the chemicals that doctors are prescribing at nauseam that are shoving down the throats of these kids who are being diagnosed with early onsets of depression.
[01:46:04.048 --> 01:46:05.888]  They're labeling it ADHD.
[01:46:05.888 --> 01:46:08.249]  They're labeling it oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:12.590]  The truth is, they're much more dying from not getting cancer treated or heart attacks.
[01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:19.112]  And they know, all the insurance companies are getting their money, but nobody's allowed to go to the doctor because it's non-essential healthcare getting their checkups.
[01:46:19.112 --> 01:46:21.492]  This is a cult brainwashing takeover.
[01:46:21.492 --> 01:46:28.174]  So again, what do you make of the left as a sacrament saying they want to take their children to be inoculated with experimental vaccines?
[01:46:28.174 --> 01:46:30.154]  Why do they take them to drag queen story time?
[01:46:30.154 --> 01:46:32.635]  Well, I guess they didn't abort them in the womb, so they want to abort them now.
[01:46:33.797 --> 01:46:39.641]  Well, what they're doing is they're castrating their minds and they're aborting them while they're alive mentally.
[01:46:39.641 --> 01:46:41.382]  They're mentally killing them.
[01:46:41.382 --> 01:46:43.604]  They're taking them over because they know.
[01:46:43.604 --> 01:46:48.007]  They know that they're not going to convince you and they're not going to convince me.
[01:46:48.007 --> 01:46:49.048]  We are too strong.
[01:46:49.048 --> 01:47:00.756]  We are the lions that are at the top of the church steeple with these bullhorns that we call microphones here broadcasting our truth to the world as long as those people behind that camera allow me to be here and you to be there, we will be here.
[01:47:00.756 --> 01:47:01.897]  And nobody's ever going to change that.
[01:47:01.957 --> 01:47:03.058]  Who are the real criminals here?
[01:47:03.058 --> 01:47:08.961]  Not just Bill Gates, not just Fauci, not just Schwab admitting it's a power grab, a corporate world government big pharma takeover.
[01:47:08.961 --> 01:47:16.545]  It's also all the enablers and it's big tech and mainstream media that suppress medical doctors and scientists and researchers and the facts.
[01:47:17.285 --> 01:47:26.913]  People putting out mainline news that these vaccines are getting banned around the world, all of them have been banned in different places, are being suppressed and they're saying that's not official UN news.
[01:47:26.913 --> 01:47:29.255]  You're only allowed to have the WHO.
[01:47:29.255 --> 01:47:31.717]  Since when did we wake up in the UN's in charge of everything?
[01:47:31.717 --> 01:47:32.698]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:47:33.484 --> 01:47:45.093]  We've had virologists, we've had epidemiologists, we've had actual real medical expert doctors that have come on my program to talk about the vaccination and it gets banned from everywhere.
[01:47:45.093 --> 01:47:47.195]  The truth is not permitted to come out.
[01:47:47.195 --> 01:47:53.380]  And so the inoculation, if you will, or the castration or the abortion of live brains
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:07.751]  It has to happen in order for them to choke out every last remaining pro-police, pro-America, America First, patriot, conservative, specifically God-fearing Christian in this country, especially if you're a white male with a penis.
[01:48:07.751 --> 01:48:09.352]  Yeah, you're done.
[01:48:09.352 --> 01:48:13.295]  So, they're not going to convince you or me, so they have to do it in the classroom.
[01:48:13.815 --> 01:48:18.137]  God's greatest gift is our children, and they are attacking our kids, as proven.
[01:48:18.137 --> 01:48:19.958]  Now, here's another example.
[01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:30.944]  Governor Tim John Walls in Minnesota, the radical looney tune, who has extended his peacetime emergency powers for an unprecedented over a year now, which was designed for something completely different.
[01:48:30.944 --> 01:48:32.645]  It didn't have anything to do with COVID, obviously.
[01:48:32.645 --> 01:48:35.446]  It wasn't intended for these purposes, but they're abusing it.
[01:48:35.446 --> 01:48:36.407]  And he's not the only one.
[01:48:36.407 --> 01:48:38.128]  We've seen these radical governors all over the place.
[01:48:38.128 --> 01:48:42.150]  But this guy actually approved a children's audio video book.
[01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:42.570]  Now get this.
[01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:47.573]  A book that teaches kids that all cops are racist murderers.
[01:48:47.573 --> 01:48:57.280]  This is actually being used specifically in school district number 196, which is like Apple Valley, Rosemount, you know, the Silver Spoon area of well-to-do children for the most part.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:06.026]  These kids are being told in an audio video book narrated by some underprivileged black guy who, by the way, happens to be a doctor himself, a professor, married to a doctor.
[01:49:06.026 --> 01:49:08.287]  Both of his parents were doctors and he never paid for anything.
[01:49:08.287 --> 01:49:11.970]  The guy's probably never even been... And it doesn't matter that the main top nine income
[01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:27.554]  Groups in the US or Asian than whites under that it's all crap whites are a tiny minority worldwide of like 7% They're just teaching groups to attack a group to be authoritarian So that a bunch of billionaire globalists can sit offshore and not pay taxes while we all kill each other.
[01:49:27.554 --> 01:49:39.397]  You are totally right Meanwhile a professor warns post corona society is a national obedience contest How do we reach out to leftist and others that are under this this this mind control in this trance?
[01:49:39.397 --> 01:49:40.437]  How do we get them out of it stu Peters?
[01:49:41.713 --> 01:49:42.673]  Oh, man.
[01:49:42.673 --> 01:49:43.934]  I don't know that you do.
[01:49:43.934 --> 01:49:49.536]  I mean, there are some cases where you just have to look at somebody and write them off because they're just too far gone.
[01:49:49.536 --> 01:49:52.317]  I mean, you deal with addictions all the time.
[01:49:52.317 --> 01:49:56.178]  I agree, but they've got corporate backing.
[01:49:56.178 --> 01:50:02.260]  The left are just following the global corporate religion of mindlessness and PC, anti-human garbage.
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:04.421]  How do we wake them up if they're in a cult?
[01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:05.281]  I guess you're saying we can't.
[01:50:05.979 --> 01:50:07.220]  I mean, yeah, I don't think you can.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:07.860]  I mean, look at this.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.482]  I mean, he's- I mean, look at this Milgram experiment.
[01:50:09.482 --> 01:50:10.502]  If you're ready to listen, you're missing.
[01:50:10.502 --> 01:50:11.683]  This is all evil.
[01:50:11.683 --> 01:50:13.645]  This is- this is- seeing what they can get us to do.
[01:50:14.457 --> 01:50:15.998]  This is 100% satanic.
[01:50:15.998 --> 01:50:18.801]  Well, let's just see if we can get him to take the vaccine.
[01:50:18.801 --> 01:50:22.464]  I mean, the vaccine is not even a vaccine, first of all.
[01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:29.230]  It's a substance, it's a cocktail that convinces your body, tricks your body and your immune system into believing that you have COVID all the time.
[01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:33.734]  I mean, imagine the habit that this is wreaking on the inside of your body.
[01:50:33.734 --> 01:50:34.354]  You're right.
[01:50:34.354 --> 01:50:35.715]  Hey, Stu Peters, I'm impressed.
[01:50:35.715 --> 01:50:36.436]  You're a smart guy.
[01:50:36.436 --> 01:50:37.817]  We love your red voice.
[01:50:37.817 --> 01:50:41.000]  Media.com and we love your show and we love it when you join us.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.141]  Join us again soon and thank you.
[01:50:42.998 --> 01:50:43.418]  I will.
[01:50:43.418 --> 01:50:44.159]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[01:50:44.159 --> 01:50:45.540]  Oh wow, that was amazing.
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.421]  It's all true too.
[01:50:46.421 --> 01:50:51.585]  I mean, this is a total corporate assault using useful idiots following a woke ideology.
[01:50:51.585 --> 01:50:52.786]  They're just NPCs.
[01:50:52.786 --> 01:50:54.027]  But I don't hate them.
[01:50:54.027 --> 01:50:59.532]  I don't hate the FBI coming out saying white people are the enemy and America's bad.
[01:50:59.532 --> 01:51:01.334]  That's a cult that's been captured.
[01:51:01.334 --> 01:51:02.855]  But it doesn't mean I'm going to submit to it.
[01:51:03.235 --> 01:51:04.896]  But let me tell you, the real enemy is Bill Gates.
[01:51:04.896 --> 01:51:05.976]  It is Fauci.
[01:51:05.976 --> 01:51:13.000]  It's these guys that are exterminating brown people worldwide, that are shutting off with the COVID lockdown, starving tens of millions.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.382]  They're like, while they're killing tens of millions with the left hand, they've got a puppet with the right hand going, look, I love George Floyd.
[01:51:18.382 --> 01:51:19.042]  I care about him.
[01:51:19.042 --> 01:51:20.143]  It's crazy.
[01:51:20.143 --> 01:51:23.324]  All right, we've got Stuart Rhodes and Mike Adams coming up.
[01:51:23.324 --> 01:51:24.025]  Mike Adams first.
[01:51:25.038 --> 01:51:34.502]  Over the top news, the top scientists, and we're talking top, top, top, saying that this vaccine is a chemical bioweapon and implants viral strains in your body to basically offshed them.
[01:51:34.502 --> 01:51:36.603]  And that's what the other literature I was just reading is saying.
[01:51:36.603 --> 01:51:39.444]  So, this is just as bad as we saw it and worse.
[01:51:39.444 --> 01:51:40.165]  It's all coming up.
[01:51:40.165 --> 01:51:41.245]  Please keep us on air.
[01:51:41.245 --> 01:51:42.566]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:51:42.566 --> 01:51:47.788]  Storewide free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com ends this Thursday morning.
[01:51:47.788 --> 01:51:48.248]  It will end.
[01:51:48.248 --> 01:51:49.389]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:51:49.389 --> 01:51:50.709]  We've got 40-50% off the krill oil.
[01:51:53.219 --> 01:51:58.675]  And all the other great products, the X2 50% off, Ultra 12, high quality V12, out of the tongue, that's 50% off.
[01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:02.231]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:05.653]  That sale ends Thursday, and it's your funding that supports the broadcast.
[01:52:05.653 --> 01:52:10.816]  Free shipping on the privacy pockets, the little Faraday cages for your cell phones.
[01:52:10.816 --> 01:52:21.722]  And back in stock, this sale will continue after Thursday, 50% off Brain Force Plus, our amazing, powerful, effective, clean Brain Boost support at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:52:21.722 --> 01:52:26.504]  50% off, and free shipping on that will continue, because we've got a big shipment in.
[01:52:26.504 --> 01:52:27.365]  But again,
[01:52:28.246 --> 01:52:31.167]  Get some t-shirts while you're there as well and some of our Wake Up America coffee.
[01:52:31.167 --> 01:52:33.848]  That's what keeps this operation in attack formation.
[01:52:33.848 --> 01:52:38.810]  Now, hour number three with the health ranger, Mike Adams and Stuart Rose.
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:41.892]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:52:41.892 --> 01:52:45.833]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:52:45.833 --> 01:52:48.455]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[01:52:48.455 --> 01:52:49.215]  Why do you do that?
[01:52:49.215 --> 01:52:52.156]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:52:52.156 --> 01:52:54.177]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[01:52:54.966 --> 01:53:03.752]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:53:03.752 --> 01:53:03.992]  Boom!
[01:53:03.992 --> 01:53:04.412]  We did it.
[01:53:04.412 --> 01:53:04.912]  It's popular.
[01:53:04.912 --> 01:53:05.673]  It's X3.
[01:53:05.673 --> 01:53:06.914]  Is it better than X2?
[01:53:06.914 --> 01:53:07.574]  You decide.
[01:53:07.574 --> 01:53:09.035]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:53:09.035 --> 01:53:13.178]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill
[01:53:14.058 --> 01:53:14.799]  Sleep Aid.
[01:53:14.799 --> 01:53:16.220]  And that is down and out.
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:17.481]  It's super strong.
[01:53:17.481 --> 01:53:19.363]  Way stronger than knockout.
[01:53:19.363 --> 01:53:20.924]  But they don't compete with each other.
[01:53:20.924 --> 01:53:22.806]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:53:22.806 --> 01:53:23.607]  Different formulas.
[01:53:23.607 --> 01:53:28.111]  And it's 40% off, out of the gates, at m4westore.com and free shipping.
[01:53:28.111 --> 01:53:29.432]  Secure your down and out today.
[01:53:29.432 --> 01:53:32.514]  And while you're sleeping, you know you're funding the M4 at the same time.
[01:53:32.514 --> 01:53:32.995]  Down and out.
[01:53:32.995 --> 01:53:36.498]  Exclusively available at m4westore.com for 40% off and free shipping.
[01:53:43.306 --> 01:53:52.252]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[01:53:52.252 --> 01:53:58.737]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[01:53:58.737 --> 01:54:03.821]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[01:54:03.821 --> 01:54:05.642]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[01:54:07.686 --> 01:54:09.588]  We're not worthy!
[01:54:09.588 --> 01:54:13.570]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:15.552]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[01:54:15.552 --> 01:54:16.953]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[01:54:16.953 --> 01:54:18.994]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[01:54:18.994 --> 01:54:20.655]  The globalists love lying to you.
[01:54:20.655 --> 01:54:21.996]  They love manipulating you.
[01:54:21.996 --> 01:54:24.698]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[01:54:24.698 --> 01:54:29.321]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[01:54:29.321 --> 01:54:32.703]  That for me is really satanic and disgusting.
[01:54:32.703 --> 01:54:35.065]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole Infowars crew
[01:54:36.682 --> 01:54:38.563]  We will never join the Globals.
[01:54:38.563 --> 01:54:40.625]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[01:54:40.625 --> 01:54:46.028]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[01:54:46.028 --> 01:54:48.650]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:11.925]  Now we're about to lay out some incredible information.
[01:55:11.925 --> 01:55:19.032]  There are so many prestigious doctors, so many prestigious scientists, that on an hourly basis come out.
[01:55:19.032 --> 01:55:20.533]  It just makes your head spin.
[01:55:20.533 --> 01:55:23.256]  Kellan McBreen last week at InfoWars.com wrote the article,
[01:55:24.136 --> 01:55:31.242]  Doctors issued dire warnings about COVID-19 vaccine dangers and then we go into some of that and then link to the paper.
[01:55:31.242 --> 01:55:40.070]  But Mike Adams has put out a more detailed report getting into what Gret Van Den Bosch actually said and who he is and how prestigious he is.
[01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:42.132]  And then separately when I saw this this morning...
[01:55:43.061 --> 01:55:52.245]  I was already reading another big report from three years ago out of a prestigious cancer research institute about mRNA really being viruses.
[01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:53.906]  That's the same thing as information.
[01:55:53.906 --> 01:55:57.928]  That's the main cause of cancer that really DNA doesn't ever produce cancer and that it's
[01:55:58.608 --> 01:56:04.092]  mRNA, RNA getting in that does it, and that that's why these scientists are saying it's going to cause massive cancer.
[01:56:04.092 --> 01:56:06.914]  So, Mike's got the big article at naturalnews.com.
[01:56:06.914 --> 01:56:07.874]  It's a big, thick one.
[01:56:07.874 --> 01:56:09.135]  It went deep into this.
[01:56:09.135 --> 01:56:16.920]  Top vaccine scientist warns the world, halt all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrollable monster will be unleashed.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.821]  Some stations don't carry this segment, some do.
[01:56:18.821 --> 01:56:22.764]  We're going to recap next segment, but Mike Adams, the health ranger, good to have you here.
[01:56:22.764 --> 01:56:24.485]  This is just getting worse and worse by the minute.
[01:56:25.472 --> 01:56:27.355]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:56:27.355 --> 01:56:37.851]  What's the bombshell about this is that through this fast vaccination program, they've been able to turn human beings into bioweapons factories.
[01:56:37.851 --> 01:56:40.516]  That's what Dr. Bosch is essentially laying out.
[01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:44.359]  In his outstanding public presentation PDF file.
[01:56:44.359 --> 01:56:58.869]  So what's happening is people... Remember, Dr. Bosch says the vaccine in his view does work, but specifically only against the very weak strain of COVID that has become essentially harmless because of natural host adaptation.
[01:56:59.349 --> 01:57:10.331]  But at the same time that vaccine is then breeding superbugs in human bodies in the same way that antibiotics breed superbugs in a hospital setting.
[01:57:10.331 --> 01:57:25.954]  And then those people who are breeding those superbugs end up shedding those superbugs and then distributing new deadly strains that are far more deadly than the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, which as I said is essentially harmless at this point.
[01:57:25.954 --> 01:57:26.074]  So
[01:57:26.654 --> 01:57:31.339]  The vaccine industry has figured out a way where they don't have to build the bioweapon.
[01:57:31.339 --> 01:57:33.482]  They can get human beings to do it.
[01:57:33.482 --> 01:57:36.885]  And they're using the vaccine as the pressure to make that happen.
[01:57:36.885 --> 01:57:39.889]  So what we have coming for 2021 and 2022, it's going to make 2020 look like a picnic.
[01:57:43.351 --> 01:57:43.992]  That's right.
[01:57:43.992 --> 01:57:45.753]  And that's what a lot of other scientists have said.
[01:57:45.753 --> 01:57:47.154]  This is really a virus.
[01:57:47.154 --> 01:57:52.458]  A lot of these vaccines, these viral vector viruses, are vaccines that use a virus.
[01:57:52.458 --> 01:57:58.363]  This also acts as a virus that manipulates the outside of the cell but controls the inside.
[01:57:58.843 --> 01:58:07.308]  And obviously they've tested all of this on a lot of other animals before under other vaccine trials when they claim they're skipping animal trials because they don't want you to see what happens with the animal.
[01:58:07.308 --> 01:58:08.809]  Stay right there, Mike Adams.
[01:58:08.809 --> 01:58:17.274]  We're going to come back to you on the other side and clean up his audio or our audio a little bit because what he's saying is absolutely so critical.
[01:58:17.274 --> 01:58:18.735]  This could not be bigger.
[01:58:18.735 --> 01:58:20.196]  This is a prestigious top
[01:58:20.982 --> 01:58:22.402]  Vaccine scientist.
[01:58:22.402 --> 01:58:23.683]  This is life and death.
[01:58:23.683 --> 01:58:24.683]  This is the facts.
[01:58:24.683 --> 01:58:26.063]  This is the science.
[01:58:26.063 --> 01:58:31.284]  Not what Bill Gates, not what the zombie Joe Biden is telling you, but the reality.
[01:58:31.284 --> 01:58:37.345]  So we're going to go right back to what he just said and recap this on the other side.
[01:58:37.345 --> 01:58:41.506]  I'm begging you for the sake of my family, your family, and humanity.
[01:58:41.506 --> 01:58:44.307]  Please, please, please, please
[01:58:44.947 --> 01:58:55.553]  Tell everybody about the local station you're listening to and send people the links to the live feed that's at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Bandai Video because that's how we get around the censors and that's how we save lives.
[01:58:55.553 --> 01:59:02.357]  I've got all the articles about how we're all going to be infertile and Politico's celebrating it and how all the humans will be dead soon.
[01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:04.518]  They're admitting this!
[01:59:04.518 --> 01:59:08.640]  This is a group of sick crazies that don't want to go to the beach and have a big crowd.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.701]  They want to get rid of people.
[01:59:11.427 --> 01:59:14.298]  And it's just a total excuse for total extermination.
[01:59:14.298 --> 01:59:17.069]  It's Hitler 2.0 by stealth.
[01:59:17.751 --> 01:59:26.276]  And that's why they're telling you, oh, we gotta burn down the cities, we love black people, oh, we're Bill Gates, Black Lives Matter, oh, because they're covering for what they're really doing, killing everybody.
[01:59:26.276 --> 01:59:28.477]  But the main target is Africa.
[01:59:28.477 --> 01:59:30.058]  I gotta say, it's true.
[01:59:30.058 --> 01:59:44.867]  So again, it's like, oh, we love blacks so much, oh, we love, and all the corporate advertising uses black people, I don't care if there's black people in ads, it doesn't bother me, I like it, it's fine, except it's all the corporate ads, the corporations are claiming they own black people as their shield, as their front, and it's sick.
[01:59:45.467 --> 01:59:48.089]  So if you don't do what Bill Gates wants, you're racist against black people?
[01:59:48.089 --> 01:59:48.410]  Yeah, right.
[02:00:10.427 --> 02:00:11.548]  I'm a fighter.
[02:00:11.548 --> 02:00:14.250]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:16.412]  And so I'll just say this.
[02:00:16.412 --> 02:00:17.433]  I try to be calm.
[02:00:17.433 --> 02:00:19.374]  I try to be focused.
[02:00:19.374 --> 02:00:22.957]  I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[02:00:22.957 --> 02:00:25.619]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[02:00:26.423 --> 02:00:31.506]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the Infowar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[02:00:31.506 --> 02:00:35.228]  You are 99% of the equation.
[02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:42.992]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, InfowarStore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[02:00:42.992 --> 02:00:45.193]  So, you are the Infowar.
[02:00:45.193 --> 02:00:46.814]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[02:00:46.814 --> 02:00:48.095]  Thank you for all you've done.
[02:00:48.095 --> 02:00:50.516]  Now let's take action together and take down the Globalist.
[02:00:54.375 --> 02:00:56.497]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:56.497 --> 02:01:07.625]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:20.334]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have some giant news breaking.
[02:01:20.334 --> 02:01:23.156]  Every few hours, more prestigious scientists, more prestigious
[02:01:23.886 --> 02:01:27.229]  Doctors, virologists go public and say this is not a vaccine.
[02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:42.420]  This is hell and mass death, mass convulsions, disease, epilepsy, narcolepsy, Guillain-Barre, Bell's palsy, is just liquefying people's organs.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:44.022]  It's insane.
[02:01:44.022 --> 02:01:49.706]  Mike Adams at naturalnews.com has drilled into what one of these top scientists, the top vaccine scientist has said,
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:02:03.126]  In the headline at nationalnews.com, it's also posted on infowars.com, top vaccine scientist warns the world, halt all COVID-19 vaccines immediately or uncontrollable monsters will be unleashed.
[02:02:03.126 --> 02:02:07.568]  Gerdt van den Bosch, Mike Adams, get into this.
[02:02:07.568 --> 02:02:08.168]  This is huge.
[02:02:08.168 --> 02:02:09.009]  Take your time.
[02:02:09.009 --> 02:02:09.589]  Explain
[02:02:10.387 --> 02:02:16.049]  What's really going on and how this science works and now it's becoming very clear what their master plan is.
[02:02:16.049 --> 02:02:16.429]  All right.
[02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:16.989]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:16.989 --> 02:02:22.351]  This is by far the most important segment that I think I've ever done in joining your show.
[02:02:22.351 --> 02:02:26.712]  We're talking about the entire human race being at risk.
[02:02:26.712 --> 02:02:32.834]  And this warning comes from Dr. Bosch, who is, by the way, a pro-vaccine
[02:02:33.474 --> 02:02:35.636]  Pro Bill and Melinda Gates scientist.
[02:02:35.636 --> 02:02:37.738]  He's an independent vaccine consultant.
[02:02:37.738 --> 02:02:38.839]  He's worked with Gavi.
[02:02:38.839 --> 02:02:40.900]  He's worked with numerous vaccine companies.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.283]  He's an expert in adjuvants and Ebola vaccines.
[02:02:44.283 --> 02:02:51.849]  And he says, listen carefully, he says that this vaccine, the COVID vaccine, works individually.
[02:02:51.849 --> 02:02:53.170]  And that's his basic premise.
[02:02:53.170 --> 02:02:54.952]  It works individually.
[02:02:54.952 --> 02:02:56.153]  But because it works,
[02:02:56.953 --> 02:03:03.635]  It nullifies the weak SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 strain that's been circulating.
[02:03:03.635 --> 02:03:23.960]  It nullifies that, but then in the aggregate, across the population at large, it causes human bodies to build super strains, which are mutants and variants that are immune to the vaccine and could pose significantly higher risks of fatality and even mass death across the globe.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:32.526]  And at the same time, the vaccine that's being injected into people is in essence disabling their innate immunity.
[02:03:32.526 --> 02:03:41.493]  That is a broad-spectrum immune system that can naturally fight the variants and mutant strains that may pose the greatest risk moving forward.
[02:03:41.493 --> 02:03:53.762]  So in essence, what I'm saying Alex, is that the vaccine industry has figured out a way to cause human beings to be turned into mutant biological weapon factories.
[02:03:54.562 --> 02:04:13.936]  They will be building these weapons and then shedding those viruses across the population that has no defense against those strains because their immune systems have been weakened, essentially nullified by the vaccine itself, while the vaccine is accelerating this adaptive response of these viruses.
[02:04:13.936 --> 02:04:14.857]  Now importantly,
[02:04:15.729 --> 02:04:16.490]  I just want to be clear.
[02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:20.873]  This is me paraphrasing my understanding of Dr. Bosch's research.
[02:04:20.873 --> 02:04:22.975]  He is not an anti-vaxxer.
[02:04:22.975 --> 02:04:29.120]  He would not say that it's wrong for an individual in a certain circumstance to get a vaccine.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.566]  He is saying that it's the wrong weapon to use prophylactically across the population at large.
[02:04:35.566 --> 02:04:36.586]  And let me stop you though.
[02:04:37.567 --> 02:04:38.107]  Absolutely.
[02:04:38.107 --> 02:04:39.728]  It's not that vaccine science isn't real.
[02:04:39.728 --> 02:04:41.668]  It's that it's had side effects, it's had problems.
[02:04:41.668 --> 02:04:43.469]  This is now gene therapy, totally different.
[02:04:43.469 --> 02:04:44.709]  But let me back you up.
[02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:46.590]  I'm on the same line of research.
[02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:49.331]  This is what Wolfgang Wudarg of the EU Warning Commission said.
[02:04:49.331 --> 02:04:52.412]  It's what the former chief scientist at Pfizer said back in December.
[02:04:52.412 --> 02:04:54.452]  They said the same things that this scientist is saying.
[02:04:54.452 --> 02:04:56.713]  But here's the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
[02:04:57.558 --> 02:05:13.230]  Cancer Center said three years ago, 2018, scientists find cancer drivers hiding in RNA not DNA and they say that DNA almost never causes cancer, that it's viruses and that's any RNA or mRNA that is causing it
[02:05:13.931 --> 02:05:26.708]  But then plugs in and does it and they go on to basically say that when you put MRNA into somebody it can suppress the protein that blocks tumors and that's why people then grow tumors when they take an MRNA vaccine.
[02:05:26.708 --> 02:05:29.712]  This is before COVID and then if you expand on that
[02:05:30.052 --> 02:05:31.854]  Here is an article on NPR.
[02:05:31.854 --> 02:05:36.359]  COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus mutations.
[02:05:36.359 --> 02:05:38.341]  This is from February 10th this year.
[02:05:38.341 --> 02:05:41.164]  Other top scientists admitting that.
[02:05:41.164 --> 02:05:47.030]  And so this is incredibly out in the open, a pre-planned operation by Bill Gates and the Globalists.
[02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.431]  What do you think?
[02:05:47.891 --> 02:05:50.154]  I believe it is deliberate, absolutely.
[02:05:50.154 --> 02:06:03.190]  I believe that they knew, and I'm talking about Fauci and the NIH and the globalists who are pushing depopulation, they knew that if they engineered a weak virus and then whipped it up through media frenzy and fear,
[02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:15.453]  They could cause the economic lockdowns, they could try to harm Trump, but most importantly, they could get people to line up and beg for vaccines, and then they could put the real weapon mechanism in the vaccines themselves.
[02:06:15.453 --> 02:06:20.415]  So, as you just mentioned, there are multiple mechanisms in the vaccines that could lead to mass death.
[02:06:20.415 --> 02:06:24.096]  I'm not talking about just a few thousand people, or even a few million people.
[02:06:24.096 --> 02:06:29.097]  Potentially, this could be killing hundreds of millions of people over the next few years around the world.
[02:06:29.837 --> 02:06:35.399]  But the multiple mechanisms, one of them is called Antibody Dependent Enhancement, ADE.
[02:06:35.399 --> 02:06:39.240]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny has discussed that in great detail.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:42.281]  Del Bigtree and others have talked about this.
[02:06:42.281 --> 02:06:50.963]  This is a mechanism that will cause a hyper-inflammatory reaction upon the person's next exposure to a coronavirus strain in the wild.
[02:06:51.623 --> 02:06:59.551]  And yet, the vaccine is causing people to build those strains, to have mutations in their own bodies, and then to release those strains.
[02:06:59.551 --> 02:07:06.017]  So it's like the vaccine industry figured out a way to turn the people against themselves, or against each other.
[02:07:06.017 --> 02:07:13.745]  They're turning people into biological weapons, and this is what Dr. Bosch is warning about, that they're releasing a, quote, uncontrollable monster with
[02:07:14.285 --> 02:07:17.908]  Consequences that almost are unimaginable.
[02:07:17.908 --> 02:07:29.957]  It may be the greatest mistake ever made in the history of human civilization, and it could lead to the fall of nations, the fall of cities in the United States, of states, of entire sectors of the economy.
[02:07:29.957 --> 02:07:39.364]  It could change the geopolitical landscape also, given that 80% of Biden supporters want to get vaccinated, while only 30% of Trump supporters want to get vaccinated.
[02:07:40.004 --> 02:08:00.918]  If the worst case scenario unfolds here, we could be looking at mass death of pro-vaccine Democrats, frankly, which would have enormous implications for the financial collapse of cities, pension funds, how cities are able to fund emergency services and infrastructure such as roads, bridges, firefighters, fire response teams, and so on.
[02:08:01.679 --> 02:08:11.030]  Alex, you almost can't talk too big about the economic and public health implications of this, and it's all been set into motion, I believe, deliberately.
[02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:12.992]  Mike, I'm here looking at the literature.
[02:08:12.992 --> 02:08:18.378]  They are admitting that this is going to cause deadly mutations of the common flu.
[02:08:18.378 --> 02:08:19.680]  This is a design carrier.
[02:08:20.387 --> 02:08:25.112]  To do this, and now they're thinking that that's what actually what the original virus does.
[02:08:25.112 --> 02:08:31.558]  It's not that deadly to most people, but that it starts mutating your cells as well and causing you to create mutations.
[02:08:31.558 --> 02:08:34.120]  But then the vaccine is an even higher level of this.
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:40.506]  And that's why Bill Gates has told all these programs that, oh, don't worry, this was really a test of bigger attacks coming from terrorists.
[02:08:40.726 --> 02:08:53.432]  Well, he's the terrorist, and now it's out in the open, but they think they'll get away with it because they've already told us, oh, climate change, deadlier viruses are coming, and they have Hollywood movies about COVID-22, COVID-23, killing millions.
[02:08:53.432 --> 02:08:54.693]  So they're even pre-programming it.
[02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:57.394]  Mike, you can see the whole thing unfolding.
[02:08:57.394 --> 02:09:03.577]  This is an extermination agenda, and scientifically, the best way to stop this virus is to vaccinate almost no one.
[02:09:04.554 --> 02:09:08.758]  And just let the virus adapt to the host and become less and less dangerous.
[02:09:08.758 --> 02:09:12.882]  That's what the former head of the Rockefeller Hospital said a year ago, remember?
[02:09:12.882 --> 02:09:13.343]  That's right.
[02:09:13.343 --> 02:09:14.103]  That's right.
[02:09:14.103 --> 02:09:18.187]  I mean, at this point, it's really no worse than the flu in most people.
[02:09:18.187 --> 02:09:23.853]  But by pushing the vaccine on everybody, including the asymptomatic carriers, by the way, the younger people,
[02:09:24.373 --> 02:09:32.118]  And by the way, I should just say, the younger people, they're the ones who are going to die now in large numbers in the second wave of this, if this scenario unfolds.
[02:09:32.118 --> 02:09:38.843]  Explain, just like Spanish Flu, they really had an autoimmune response to the virus, now they're going to have violent autoimmune responses, the younger the people.
[02:09:38.843 --> 02:09:40.424]  What do we do for our children then?
[02:09:40.424 --> 02:09:41.885]  I'm so worried about my children now.
[02:09:41.885 --> 02:09:43.526]  That's exactly what I was reading, Mike.
[02:09:44.066 --> 02:09:50.709]  See, children have really strong, really flexible innate immune systems that can handle different strains and different mutations automatically.
[02:09:50.709 --> 02:10:00.893]  But when you vaccinate them, those who don't even need vaccinations, even if the vaccines work, you vaccinate them, you disable their general response innate immunity.
[02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:07.876]  You make them defenseless against the mutant strains that are being built in other people's bodies and then released through viral shedding.
[02:10:07.876 --> 02:10:09.657]  So the youth are going to be in real trouble.
[02:10:10.237 --> 02:10:11.339]  Uh, in the next year or two years.
[02:10:11.339 --> 02:10:18.227]  And so our immune systems are so powerful the globalists couldn't cook stuff up that would kill us en masse unless they got our own bodies to produce what kills us.
[02:10:18.227 --> 02:10:18.667]  That's right.
[02:10:18.667 --> 02:10:20.770]  They turned us into their bioweapons factories.
[02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:21.531]  Exactly.
[02:10:21.531 --> 02:10:25.636]  And that's what, not just the scientists you reported on as a top guy, but even NPR admits that.
[02:10:26.096 --> 02:10:31.860]  Meanwhile, they've got national government saying, if you don't take the vaccine, you're the reason we can't go out.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.340]  You're the reason there'll be spreaders.
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:36.022]  Then they say, but even if you take the vaccine, you still can't go outside.
[02:10:36.022 --> 02:10:38.243]  This is the total dystopic takeover.
[02:10:38.243 --> 02:10:39.964]  Mike Adams is on fire as usual.
[02:10:39.964 --> 02:10:40.945]  Naturalnews.com.
[02:10:40.945 --> 02:10:44.007]  We'll be back in a few minutes to talk to him about where we go from here.
[02:10:44.007 --> 02:10:44.947]  Stay with us.
[02:10:44.947 --> 02:10:46.108]  Infowars.com.
[02:10:46.108 --> 02:10:49.730]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:10:49.730 --> 02:10:52.111]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[02:10:52.111 --> 02:10:52.892]  It's very bittersweet.
[02:10:53.843 --> 02:10:56.826]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[02:10:56.826 --> 02:10:58.088]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[02:10:58.088 --> 02:10:59.009]  But I don't care about that.
[02:10:59.009 --> 02:11:01.051]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[02:11:01.051 --> 02:11:05.756]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[02:11:05.756 --> 02:11:09.120]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:10.641]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:11:10.641 --> 02:11:11.843]  But let's just say this.
[02:11:11.843 --> 02:11:13.564]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[02:11:13.564 --> 02:11:15.607]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[02:11:16.227 --> 02:11:19.869]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:11:19.869 --> 02:11:22.430]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:25.631]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[02:11:25.631 --> 02:11:26.491]  Do they fund freedom?
[02:11:26.491 --> 02:11:27.592]  No, a lot of them don't.
[02:11:27.592 --> 02:11:34.034]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[02:11:34.034 --> 02:11:35.775]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[02:11:35.775 --> 02:11:38.616]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[02:11:39.176 --> 02:11:42.297]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[02:11:42.297 --> 02:11:49.940]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air, and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:58.222]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[02:11:58.222 --> 02:11:59.083]  It is Down and Out.
[02:11:59.083 --> 02:12:00.423]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[02:12:00.883 --> 02:12:03.885]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[02:12:03.885 --> 02:12:06.927]  It's got 4 milligrams of high-quality melatonin.
[02:12:06.927 --> 02:12:09.508]  It's got 25 milligrams of passionflower.

[02:12:26.178 --> 02:12:29.959]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[02:12:29.959 --> 02:12:30.679]  It's incredible.
[02:12:30.679 --> 02:12:33.199]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[02:12:33.199 --> 02:12:35.680]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[02:12:52.423 --> 02:12:55.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:05.991 --> 02:13:17.019]  I want to be clear, what Mike Adams is reporting on at NaturalNews.com, with top vaccine scientists worldwide respected, Gert Van Den Bosch, he's not isolated.
[02:13:17.019 --> 02:13:21.081]  I just showed you an NPR article, a New York Times article, admitting it could create super strains.
[02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:23.543]  They're saying it will.
[02:13:23.543 --> 02:13:24.684]  Bill Gates knows what he's doing.
[02:13:24.684 --> 02:13:26.025]  Here's a clip from him a year ago.
[02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:29.375]  On Colbert saying, oh, I'm a hero.
[02:13:29.375 --> 02:13:35.225]  I predicted all this with the Rockefeller Foundation that actually called for using viruses to sterilize us and kill us starting in the 60s.
[02:13:35.225 --> 02:13:36.467]  We showed those articles first hour.
[02:13:37.361 --> 02:13:39.943]  And then he's like, oh, terrorists are going to release something far worse.
[02:13:39.943 --> 02:13:43.225]  And now they're telling us, oh, climate change, it's coming, something worse.
[02:13:43.225 --> 02:13:47.588]  And they use it to lock down, consolidate power, China takes over, big tech takes over.
[02:13:47.588 --> 02:13:49.149]  Here's a clip of what he said last year.
[02:13:49.149 --> 02:13:50.269]  And now we know.
[02:13:50.269 --> 02:13:51.610]  They're going to say it's terrorists.
[02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:52.351]  Watch.
[02:13:52.351 --> 02:13:56.914]  When people are falling dead all around us, Dr. Tinpenny thinks it'll be in just a few months.
[02:13:56.914 --> 02:13:58.855]  We're already seeing old folks dying everywhere.
[02:13:58.855 --> 02:14:00.636]  But that's the immediate response.
[02:14:02.297 --> 02:14:05.961]  I think that's just a collateral damage of how deadly this is.
[02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:07.583]  All the evidence shows it's coming.
[02:14:07.583 --> 02:14:09.825]  It's a soft kill so they have plausible deniability.
[02:14:09.825 --> 02:14:10.766]  Here's Bill Gates.
[02:14:10.766 --> 02:14:17.033]  What's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years from now that we're not listening to at the present?
[02:14:18.246 --> 02:14:21.407]  Well, I didn't want to be right.
[02:14:21.407 --> 02:14:23.728]  What I wanted to do was... I understand.
[02:14:23.728 --> 02:14:25.669]  I'm not saying you won.
[02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:26.589]  Everybody loses.
[02:14:26.589 --> 02:14:27.410]  Nobody wins with us.
[02:14:27.410 --> 02:14:30.631]  And I'm not saying that this is not an end zone dance.
[02:14:30.631 --> 02:14:35.633]  I'm just saying, what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[02:14:38.985 --> 02:14:46.811]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because they're a pathogen with a high death rate would be ticked.
[02:14:46.811 --> 02:15:06.345]  Now the good news is, not trying to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism.
[02:15:08.092 --> 02:15:11.215]  Well, um, Mr. Gates, thanks so much for being here.
[02:15:11.215 --> 02:15:12.096]  Thanks so much for the effort.
[02:15:12.096 --> 02:15:12.917]  Look how sick he is.
[02:15:12.917 --> 02:15:13.698]  Look how happy he is.
[02:15:13.698 --> 02:15:15.980]  Okay, Mike, we got seven minutes left.
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:16.941]  I appreciate you.
[02:15:16.941 --> 02:15:17.702]  I've been cutting in a lot.
[02:15:17.702 --> 02:15:18.242]  Just agreeing with you.
[02:15:18.242 --> 02:15:19.183]  This is so important.
[02:15:19.183 --> 02:15:23.187]  You've got the floor to finish up what you think's coming and how we stop this, because this is so obvious.
[02:15:23.187 --> 02:15:24.869]  I don't know how they think they're going to get away with it.
[02:15:25.737 --> 02:15:31.419]  Well, individually, one of the important things we need to realize is that people who are vaccinated are ticking time bombs.
[02:15:31.419 --> 02:15:33.780]  They're walking bioweapons.
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:39.283]  And if you look at really what's going to happen here, it's going to be the vaccinated killing the vaccinated.
[02:15:39.283 --> 02:15:39.823]  Because you're going to...
[02:15:40.566 --> 02:15:49.753]  You're going to have vaccinated people who are shedding the viruses and then you're going to have other vaccinated people who have weakened innate immune systems who are more susceptible to those strains.
[02:15:49.753 --> 02:15:53.095]  So it's kind of like a zombie movie where the zombies are eating the zombies.
[02:15:53.095 --> 02:15:55.437]  You're going to have the vaccinated killing the vaccinated.
[02:15:55.437 --> 02:15:59.560]  Now, but then the media will blame the unvaccinated during all of this.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:03.343]  So the unvaccinated are going to be condemned as mass murderers
[02:16:04.003 --> 02:16:08.867]  And terrorists when it's actually the vaccinated who are the murderers.
[02:16:08.867 --> 02:16:11.909]  Inadvertently, I'm not saying that they want to go out and kill people.
[02:16:11.909 --> 02:16:18.354]  They're just gullible and brainwashed and they believe in false authority like the CDC and the WHO.
[02:16:18.354 --> 02:16:21.176]  So, fast forward two to three years.
[02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:32.193]  If these predictions are true, that Dr. Bosch is warning about, and that Dr. Tenpenny is warning about, then the whole global landscape is going to be entirely different, Alex.
[02:16:32.193 --> 02:16:37.775]  We're talking about a massive population reduction, which is what Bill Gates wants, openly.
[02:16:37.775 --> 02:16:46.498]  We're talking about a collapse of real estate values, a collapse of tax revenues for municipalities, cities, states, and nations all around the world.
[02:16:47.179 --> 02:16:51.562]  Therefore, the collapse of governments and pension funds and probably stock markets and so on.
[02:16:51.562 --> 02:17:02.111]  So, the economic implications of the public health crisis that's being unleashed by mass vaccinations, it's almost, you know, too much to consider.
[02:17:02.111 --> 02:17:03.712]  It's going to be totally insane.
[02:17:03.712 --> 02:17:05.173]  And yeah, those globalists, they think it's funny.
[02:17:05.791 --> 02:17:07.072]  Because this is their goal.
[02:17:07.072 --> 02:17:08.414]  That's what they want to do.
[02:17:08.414 --> 02:17:10.596]  So, what can we do?
[02:17:10.596 --> 02:17:24.191]  Of course, all the things that you've been talking about, and your guest, Alex, which is boost your immune function, make sure you have good nutrition, get plenty of rest, and avoid vaccinated people because they are the virus shedders.
[02:17:24.791 --> 02:17:26.954]  They are the mutant factories.
[02:17:26.954 --> 02:17:33.881]  And then get educated and try to educate the people around you so that they learn before they run over and try to get vaccinated.
[02:17:33.881 --> 02:17:39.767]  Because if you vaccinate yourself as an ignorant, uninformed person, you are sacrificing your life.
[02:17:39.767 --> 02:17:41.529]  I call it vaccine suicide.
[02:17:42.149 --> 02:17:57.417]  And I'm sad to say, I'll say this publicly, you know, there are distant relatives in my own family who are committing vaccine suicide, probably in your family too, you watching this, and friends, people you know, maybe co-workers who are committing vaccine suicide.
[02:17:57.417 --> 02:18:02.960]  It doesn't kill them necessarily immediately, although it is killing some people right away, but the long-term effects
[02:18:04.254 --> 02:18:04.995]  Not even long term.
[02:18:04.995 --> 02:18:05.495]  Medium term.
[02:18:05.495 --> 02:18:07.137]  It could be a year.
[02:18:07.137 --> 02:18:08.558]  It could be less than two years.
[02:18:08.558 --> 02:18:09.458]  It could be a few months.
[02:18:09.458 --> 02:18:12.661]  Depends on how quickly the mutant strains are created.
[02:18:12.661 --> 02:18:15.023]  Many of those vaccinated people will die.
[02:18:15.023 --> 02:18:16.324]  Almost certainly.
[02:18:16.324 --> 02:18:30.855]  So, this is what we're looking at in terms of this really apocalyptic medical situation that's being put in place by the vaccine companies intentionally while they're making money, they're having massive profits, sacrificing human lives.
[02:18:31.315 --> 02:18:35.420]  Just like what Governor Cuomo did in New York, but on a much larger scale.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:40.005]  You know, for his political gains, he sacrificed the elderly, stuffed them in the nursing homes.
[02:18:40.005 --> 02:18:41.426]  Well, he was ordered to do that.
[02:18:41.426 --> 02:18:43.769]  Other Democrats followed it all over the country and all over the world.
[02:18:43.769 --> 02:18:46.391]  Blue states, globalist operatives did.
[02:18:46.391 --> 02:18:48.754]  But he's too dumb to even turn it against them.
[02:18:48.754 --> 02:18:50.616]  He's too dumb to even realize what they're doing to him.
[02:18:51.671 --> 02:18:57.296]  Well, absolutely, but it shows you how demonic these Democrat control freaks are.
[02:18:57.296 --> 02:18:58.397]  They hate humanity.
[02:18:58.397 --> 02:19:03.382]  They literally want to mass murder the human race, and it looks like they're achieving it.
[02:19:03.382 --> 02:19:05.484]  But who's saying no to this?
[02:19:05.484 --> 02:19:11.189]  The informed Trump supporters, conservatives, viewers of your show, of my website, and so on.
[02:19:11.189 --> 02:19:13.952]  It's the informed, independent people who are going to be the survivors of this.
[02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:29.807]  And Mike, the most important thing you said is, A, the mainline literature on the top side to say this is going to create real super strains, and it's going to cause autoimmune responses to cytokine storms, Spanish flu type stuff, autoimmune attacks of the body, liquefying the organs, it's already happening.
[02:19:29.807 --> 02:19:36.193]  But worse than that is, then once the next big wave breaks out from this, could be months, could be a year,
[02:19:36.877 --> 02:19:39.999]  According to medical doctors and scientists, they're going to blame us.
[02:19:39.999 --> 02:19:40.900]  They already are.
[02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:43.221]  Even though in the literature it admits it's not us.
[02:19:43.221 --> 02:19:43.702]  It doesn't matter.
[02:19:43.702 --> 02:19:44.962]  They're still getting ready to blame us.
[02:19:44.962 --> 02:19:46.063]  This is so dangerous.
[02:19:46.063 --> 02:19:47.744]  You can see the whole plan right now.
[02:19:47.744 --> 02:19:51.467]  They're going to push the mass panic in the second wave.
[02:19:52.716 --> 02:19:56.618]  And then say that this justifies gunpoint vaccinations.
[02:19:56.618 --> 02:20:08.642]  So at that point, they will be able to have the political power to unleash now the woke military to go door-to-door in cities across America, confiscating your guns and vaccinating you at gunpoint.
[02:20:08.642 --> 02:20:13.184]  That's right, medical tyranny with a race war, with gun confiscation.
[02:20:13.184 --> 02:20:15.445]  A medical tyranny civil war is the amended plan.
[02:20:15.445 --> 02:20:16.926]  You see it all being set up now.
[02:20:16.926 --> 02:20:18.066]  In a minute and a half, how do we stop it?
[02:20:19.224 --> 02:20:21.606]  Well, number one, we have to survive.
[02:20:21.606 --> 02:20:23.087]  We have to be alive in order to fight this.
[02:20:23.087 --> 02:20:30.412]  So all the things we just mentioned, take care of your immune system, take care of your health, avoid the vaccine at all costs and avoid other people who are vaccinated.
[02:20:30.412 --> 02:20:35.956]  Secondly, we've got to continue to build out our independent platforms like you have done, like I'm doing.
[02:20:35.956 --> 02:20:38.298]  We've got to continue to expand our reach.
[02:20:38.298 --> 02:20:42.621]  You know, the mainstream media is collapsing in terms of its viewership.
[02:20:42.621 --> 02:20:48.125]  And yet more and more people are viewing independent truth media, even though the censorship has never been worse.
[02:20:48.445 --> 02:20:53.048]  But we are winning to those people who are willing to live.
[02:20:53.048 --> 02:20:56.791]  Those who want to commit suicide and die, we can't help them any longer.
[02:20:56.791 --> 02:21:04.096]  Pray for them, wish them the best, but wave goodbye to those people because many of those people, millions or even hundreds of millions, may die.
[02:21:04.096 --> 02:21:07.338]  But for the survivors, educate, inform, and connect.
[02:21:07.338 --> 02:21:10.681]  And that's how we can rebuild society after this vaccine holocaust.
[02:21:11.341 --> 02:21:12.001]  We're good to go.
[02:21:31.994 --> 02:21:33.475]  I don't think Bill Gates is going to get away with it.
[02:21:33.475 --> 02:21:35.256]  All these countries are banning vaccines.
[02:21:35.256 --> 02:21:36.356]  All these scientists are coming out.
[02:21:36.356 --> 02:21:37.277]  You're coming out.
[02:21:37.277 --> 02:21:38.317]  I don't think this is going well.
[02:21:38.317 --> 02:21:40.978]  In 10 seconds, do you think it's backfiring on them at a certain level?
[02:21:40.978 --> 02:21:42.299]  Not yet, but it will.
[02:21:42.299 --> 02:21:43.179]  It's beginning to.
[02:21:43.179 --> 02:21:48.322]  24 countries in Europe have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine, and Italy has launched a possible criminal investigation.
[02:21:48.322 --> 02:21:48.642]  That's right.
[02:21:48.642 --> 02:21:49.142]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:21:49.142 --> 02:21:56.466]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full wars ahead.
[02:21:56.466 --> 02:21:59.747]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[02:21:59.747 --> 02:22:00.508]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:09.711]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[02:22:09.711 --> 02:22:12.112]  They're trying to shudder and silence the human resistance.
[02:22:12.112 --> 02:22:17.736]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[02:22:17.736 --> 02:22:20.878]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[02:22:20.878 --> 02:22:23.660]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:26.942]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:32.634]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[02:22:32.634 --> 02:22:34.355]  We have the power.
[02:22:34.355 --> 02:22:38.678]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[02:22:38.678 --> 02:22:44.263]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[02:22:44.263 --> 02:22:50.127]  So be the Paul Revere's you are.
[02:22:50.127 --> 02:22:53.870]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:57.033]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:22:57.566 --> 02:23:05.209]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:10.971]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[02:23:10.971 --> 02:23:22.556]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:23:23.181 --> 02:23:25.323]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:23:25.323 --> 02:23:29.426]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:23:29.426 --> 02:23:40.035]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.

[02:23:49.582 --> 02:23:50.243]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:54.142 --> 02:23:59.127]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[02:23:59.127 --> 02:24:01.630]  It's just absolutely on target.
[02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:04.673]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[02:24:04.673 --> 02:24:06.214]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[02:24:06.214 --> 02:24:10.999]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[02:24:10.999 --> 02:24:12.621]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[02:24:13.985 --> 02:24:26.335]  Now, the supplements, the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have at InfoWarsTore.com are the very best sourced, wild-crafted, organic, and natural products you're going to find anywhere.

[02:24:50.815 --> 02:24:51.436]  I actually bought this.
[02:24:51.436 --> 02:24:53.437]  It blocks UHS frequencies.
[02:24:53.437 --> 02:24:58.702]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[02:24:58.702 --> 02:25:05.547]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[02:25:05.547 --> 02:25:07.189]  With or without a battery.
[02:25:07.959 --> 02:25:14.061]  Now, with the Infowars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[02:25:14.061 --> 02:25:14.921]  Excellent.

[02:25:20.523 --> 02:25:23.544]  And you can too, at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:25:25.124 --> 02:25:35.892]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
[02:25:35.892 --> 02:25:40.816]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.
[02:25:40.816 --> 02:25:46.720]  Support the InfoWar and get your InfoWars privacy pouch today.
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:47.801]  InfoWarStore.com
[02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:55.982]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:26:17.598 --> 02:26:21.479]  Well, he's called person number one by the FBI.
[02:26:21.479 --> 02:26:24.540]  Articles in the New York Times and Washington Post by the day.
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:27.581]  CNN call for his arrest.
[02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:30.122]  They call for my arrest for interviewing him.
[02:26:30.122 --> 02:26:33.283]  You can't let him actually speak for himself.
[02:26:33.283 --> 02:26:40.645]  I've known Stewart since really before he founded Oath Keepers, back when he was really a spokesperson for Ron Paul.
[02:26:40.645 --> 02:26:45.326]  And he's a Yale Law graduate, and of course, you know, been someone that's written about the
[02:26:45.968 --> 02:26:48.570]  Impending globalist police state.
[02:26:48.570 --> 02:26:57.137]  And he's got an organization, Oath Keepers, that follows the Constitution and gets law enforcement, police, former and current, to just say that they'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:26:57.137 --> 02:27:01.921]  Well, because a couple members of his group, out of tens of thousands, went into the Capitol.
[02:27:01.921 --> 02:27:04.243]  They're trying to send him to prison.
[02:27:04.243 --> 02:27:07.866]  They're holding others without bail that didn't even break anything or do anything.
[02:27:08.453 --> 02:27:09.414]  We're good to go.
[02:27:26.494 --> 02:27:28.316]  Tell us what's really going on here.
[02:27:50.683 --> 02:27:57.952]  Well, all they have is, as I told my guys, if you're not on a security detail, come to the northeast corner of the Capitol.
[02:27:57.952 --> 02:28:07.604]  We were protecting the Latinos for Trump event about two blocks to the northeast of the Capitol, and our men were out on PSD details, escorting stop and steal speakers.
[02:28:08.805 --> 02:28:12.807]  Doing the PSD for Robert Stone and then also securing events.
[02:28:12.807 --> 02:28:20.912]  And there was, you know, there was a supposedly supposed to be an event right there on the Capitol lawn by Alexander, right?
[02:28:20.912 --> 02:28:22.533]  Reserve space.
[02:28:22.533 --> 02:28:28.176]  And so our guys were escorting some of his speakers from the Ellipse back up towards the Capitol to go do an event.
[02:28:28.783 --> 02:28:39.952]  And so when we saw that people were breaching around the Capitol, we heard they're breaking into the Capitol, I told my guys, if you're not on PSG Detail, come to me at the northeastern corner outside the Capitol.
[02:28:39.952 --> 02:28:40.792]  That's where I was standing.
[02:28:40.792 --> 02:28:41.853]  And that's all they got.
[02:28:41.853 --> 02:28:48.098]  That's the only communication from me to my men was come to me if you're not on PSG Detail.
[02:28:48.098 --> 02:28:48.498]  And that's it.
[02:28:48.498 --> 02:28:50.980]  They're trying to bootstrap into some kind of conspiracy.
[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:54.522]  Bottom line is, though, is that they are suing President Trump.
[02:28:54.522 --> 02:29:09.613]  We've got Benny Thompson, the congressman from Georgia, who is suing President Trump and Rudy Giuliani and Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, alleging that all of us were in some kind of grand conspiracy to assault the Capitol and disrupt the proceedings of Congress, which is complete bunk.
[02:29:10.277 --> 02:29:13.401]  The last thing you would do would be want to do this at the Capitol.
[02:29:13.401 --> 02:29:16.706]  We wanted a 10-day investigation because one hadn't been done by the Senate.
[02:29:16.706 --> 02:29:17.727]  We were there supporting that.
[02:29:17.727 --> 02:29:21.592]  The last thing we would do would be get whipped into this frenzy.
[02:29:22.637 --> 02:29:29.401]  Right, and also it's completely absurd to say that we were attempting to commit an insurrection without guns.
[02:29:29.401 --> 02:29:30.882]  It makes no sense, right?
[02:29:30.882 --> 02:29:38.867]  If we were actually trying to take over the Capitol or commit some kind of insurrection, we would definitely have brought weapons, right?
[02:29:38.867 --> 02:29:40.408]  This is complete absurdity.
[02:29:40.408 --> 02:29:43.150]  The team leader on the ground, he goes by the name Whip,
[02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:50.137]  He is a combat veteran, actually an explosive expert in the Army, and a Triple Canopy and Blackwater contractor.
[02:29:50.137 --> 02:29:51.578]  The guy knows what he's doing.
[02:29:51.578 --> 02:29:52.819]  So it's completely ridiculous.
[02:29:52.819 --> 02:29:59.666]  It's actually an insult to his competency to say that he was somehow involved in some big conspiracy to commit insurrection.
[02:29:59.666 --> 02:30:00.687]  It's just total nonsense.
[02:30:00.687 --> 02:30:02.509]  Well, I can tell you that we were all set up.
[02:30:02.509 --> 02:30:05.171]  We were told there'd be security there, Secret Service, the Capitol Police.
[02:30:05.171 --> 02:30:07.493]  Instead, the Capitol Police were cut in half, sent on.
[02:30:08.869 --> 02:30:25.481]  Traffic control, and we now know that that's the case, and so it was a few hundred Q people, a few Boogaloos, a few Proud Boys, and a few people saying they were Oath Keepers, some that weren't, were also there, that went in, most of them peaceful, within the velvet robes, but we all know the history of that.
[02:30:25.481 --> 02:30:30.485]  Clearly General Honor, rather than the gun confiscation in Katrina, says he wants war with the American people.
[02:30:30.485 --> 02:30:34.208]  The new Secretary of Defense literally is like an anti-white racist,
[02:30:34.648 --> 02:30:36.630]  Biden's going ahead with Black Lives Matter.
[02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:41.574]  Clearly, that's their narrative of civil war, and they're going ahead with that.
[02:30:41.574 --> 02:30:44.136]  Where do you see this going?
[02:30:44.136 --> 02:30:53.784]  Well, it's a Stalinistic purge and a Stalinistic persecution campaign, and it's meant to divide the political right to get everyone to turn on each other, which sadly you're seeing some do.
[02:30:53.784 --> 02:31:00.009]  You're seeing some people turn on anybody who went inside and condemn them, and I refuse to do that.
[02:31:00.009 --> 02:31:03.952]  All the guys that went in who were Oath Keepers, or even the ones that weren't Oath Keepers that are with Oath Keepers,
[02:31:04.392 --> 02:31:05.393]  We're standing with them.
[02:31:05.393 --> 02:31:07.034]  We're saying, look, we're going to wait and see.
[02:31:07.034 --> 02:31:08.855]  They're presumed innocent until proven guilty.
[02:31:08.855 --> 02:31:13.298]  We're going to give them a chance to defend themselves and articulate why they went in.
[02:31:13.298 --> 02:31:21.603]  But frankly, the way I see it, all I can see is that they walked in like a bunch of other people did after the breach happened, took a few selfies and walked back out.
[02:31:21.603 --> 02:31:22.704]  That's not even trespass.
[02:31:23.004 --> 02:31:23.384]  We're good to go.
[02:31:40.435 --> 02:31:46.117]  Well that's right, they were just burning the Portland Federal Court House of People in it two days ago.
[02:31:46.117 --> 02:31:48.177]  The media wouldn't even pick that up.
[02:31:48.177 --> 02:31:51.338]  But I want to be clear, Stuart, I didn't see any oath keepers doing anything violent or wrong.
[02:31:51.338 --> 02:31:53.599]  It looks like after it was open, they just went in.
[02:31:53.599 --> 02:31:56.040]  But there were some anti-fubs, there were some provocateurs.
[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:59.941]  I think the people that first attacked police were anti-fubs, we know that.
[02:31:59.941 --> 02:32:03.122]  And I think there were a few bad actors that pooped on Pelosi's thing.
[02:32:03.122 --> 02:32:05.943]  That's vandalism, I don't support it, it made people look bad.
[02:32:06.583 --> 02:32:07.703]  But I do see what you're saying.
[02:32:07.703 --> 02:32:10.905]  We should overall see everybody as innocent until proven guilty.
[02:32:10.905 --> 02:32:14.306]  And I don't see evidence of actually Oath Keepers being violent inside.
[02:32:14.306 --> 02:32:17.387]  Why are they trying to hone in then on Oath Keepers and set them up?
[02:32:17.387 --> 02:32:21.148]  Because it's a big, competent group that had a lot of good military and police that are still in it?
[02:32:22.711 --> 02:32:24.412]  Absolutely, and they're afraid of us.
[02:32:24.412 --> 02:32:27.173]  I mean, Antifa on the streets has feared us for years.
[02:32:27.173 --> 02:32:31.595]  That's why it's ironic, but we've never even had to use force against Antifa.
[02:32:31.595 --> 02:32:38.557]  The backdrop to this is we protected over a dozen Trump rallies, people outside of the Trump rallies being escorted by Oath Keepers.
[02:32:38.557 --> 02:32:47.101]  We were at all three of the events in D.C., the protests after the election was stolen, in November and December, and doing the exact same mission.
[02:32:47.441 --> 02:32:52.143]  Our guys are wearing helmets and body armor because they're there to protect people against Antifa.
[02:32:52.143 --> 02:32:56.724]  Antifa likes to hit you in the head with hard objects, likes to stab people, and then throw crap in your eyes.
[02:32:56.724 --> 02:33:00.526]  So that's why our guys are wearing body armor and helmets and body armor.
[02:33:00.526 --> 02:33:03.747]  Sure, what do you think of all the footage of leftists dressing up like Trump supporters?
[02:33:03.747 --> 02:33:08.588]  I mean, we know, even in Time Magazine, they bragged a month ago that they actually went and helped stir this up.
[02:33:08.588 --> 02:33:12.690]  I mean, CNN paid Jay Nex, you know, 70-something thousand dollars.
[02:33:13.908 --> 02:33:15.769]  Well, we saw it on the streets in November and December.
[02:33:15.769 --> 02:33:18.850]  We saw Antifa posing as Trump supporters.
[02:33:18.850 --> 02:33:20.451]  And, you know, they had no discipline, though.
[02:33:20.451 --> 02:33:23.133]  They wound up getting shouting matches with Trump supporters.
[02:33:23.133 --> 02:33:24.813]  They're pretty easy to pick out.
[02:33:24.813 --> 02:33:27.655]  So, absolutely, there were Antifa on the ground there in D.C.
[02:33:27.655 --> 02:33:28.935]  There always are.
[02:33:28.935 --> 02:33:30.796]  And, yes, they were masquerading.
[02:33:30.796 --> 02:33:32.817]  Some of them were masquerading as Trump supporters.
[02:33:32.817 --> 02:33:34.358]  They always do that.
[02:33:34.358 --> 02:33:35.719]  So, it's completely no surprise.
[02:33:35.719 --> 02:33:41.541]  And it's an absolute lie for the FBI to testify that there were no Antifa on the ground at the Capitol.
[02:33:41.541 --> 02:33:42.482]  It's complete nonsense.
[02:33:43.707 --> 02:33:44.829]  Well, it's not only that.
[02:33:44.829 --> 02:33:46.471]  I mean, I regard every one of our guys right now
[02:34:01.378 --> 02:34:03.900]  Even the ones who went in as political prisoners.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:08.362]  Because, like I said, for the most part, all they do is walk in and take a few selfies.
[02:34:08.362 --> 02:34:16.627]  And I think, I anticipate what their defense is going to be for some of them, is they went in to actually help police officers and help them to get to safety.
[02:34:16.627 --> 02:34:20.309]  Like one small female officer is being overwhelmed by larger males.
[02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:23.490]  I believe it'll come out that our guys actually helped rescue her.
[02:34:23.490 --> 02:34:28.333]  And so, at other events like that, where they actually were directly assisting law enforcement.
[02:34:28.653 --> 02:34:31.154]  I think it's going to come out and also bring in medical aid.
[02:34:31.154 --> 02:34:39.378]  And so, you know, like I said, I think it's incredibly important for the conservative right to look at these people as political prisoners and to do what the leftists do.
[02:34:39.378 --> 02:34:41.119]  The leftists always circle the wagons.
[02:34:41.119 --> 02:34:43.000]  Oh, well they bail out people that shoot cops.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:43.900]  Stay right there.
[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:47.242]  We're going to be back with Stuart Rhodes, O'Keepers.org.
[02:34:47.242 --> 02:34:49.463]  Five more minutes and Paul Joseph Watts is taking over.
[02:34:49.463 --> 02:34:49.743]  Remember.
[02:34:50.805 --> 02:34:55.790]  Go there, check them out, because they're good people and they're not going to be able to get the truth out if they're able to silence them and shut them down.
[02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:57.532]  And once they shut them down, they can lie about them.
[02:34:57.532 --> 02:34:58.332]  Same thing with InfoWars.
[02:34:58.332 --> 02:35:01.515]  They can silence us, they can then frame us and frame the Liberty Movement.
[02:35:01.515 --> 02:35:02.536]  Keep us on air.
[02:35:02.536 --> 02:35:03.818]  Free shipping ends Thursday.
[02:35:03.818 --> 02:35:04.358]  Storewide.

[02:35:08.534 --> 02:35:09.034]  People love it.
[02:35:09.034 --> 02:35:09.675]  Sold out for months.

[02:35:15.541 --> 02:35:18.023]  But everything else, the big sale has to end.
[02:35:18.023 --> 02:35:20.325]  Infowarsstore.com, that's how we fund our operations.
[02:35:20.325 --> 02:35:25.270]  Whether it's X2, or whether it's BrainForce Plus, or whether it's TurboForce, it's all there.
[02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:26.831]  VazoBeats, back in stock.
[02:35:26.831 --> 02:35:28.954]  With a very limited supply, and it's all selling out.
[02:35:28.954 --> 02:35:31.316]  The Privacy Pockets to protect your cell phone from being tracked.
[02:35:31.696 --> 02:35:33.797]  Down and out, this amazing Liquid Sleep Aid.
[02:35:33.797 --> 02:35:37.119]  It's like Rocket Rest, but Liquid way stronger than Knockout.
[02:35:37.119 --> 02:35:38.079]  I'm not saying you want that.
[02:35:38.079 --> 02:35:39.540]  It's just if you want something way stronger, it's there.
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:40.500]  It's really good.
[02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:42.401]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:45.582]  Hour number four, finishing up with Stuart Rhodes, and then Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:35:45.582 --> 02:35:46.023]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:35:49.046 --> 02:35:52.648]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[02:35:52.648 --> 02:35:57.210]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:36:06.094]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[02:36:06.414 --> 02:36:10.878]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[02:36:10.878 --> 02:36:28.415]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons, to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us, under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[02:36:28.995 --> 02:36:44.820]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:48.241]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[02:36:48.761 --> 02:36:52.603]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:36:52.603 --> 02:36:56.924]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:36:56.924 --> 02:37:05.048]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:37:05.788 --> 02:37:22.395]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:37:22.395 --> 02:37:33.440]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:42.424]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:37:42.424 --> 02:37:49.867]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:49.867 --> 02:37:53.068]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing Devil's Advocate on air.
[02:37:54.335 --> 02:37:57.017]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists.
[02:37:57.017 --> 02:38:06.204]  That the public's so dumbed down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[02:38:06.204 --> 02:38:07.965]  Yes, that's the position of the globalists.
[02:38:07.965 --> 02:38:08.766]  They play God.
[02:38:08.766 --> 02:38:13.609]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[02:38:13.609 --> 02:38:16.451]  And I've told you that the globalists have tried to hire me.
[02:38:16.451 --> 02:38:17.892]  They've tried to get me to join them.
[02:38:17.892 --> 02:38:19.734]  But metaphysically, at a spiritual level,
[02:38:21.173 --> 02:38:22.153]  I have the Holy Spirit.
[02:38:22.153 --> 02:38:23.894]  I have connection with God.
[02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:26.634]  And I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy.
[02:38:26.634 --> 02:38:36.136]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system, believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power over it.
[02:38:36.136 --> 02:38:42.057]  Whether you're just a steel worker, or a school teacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[02:38:42.057 --> 02:38:48.619]  And treating other people like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like.
[02:38:48.619 --> 02:38:49.299]  And that's a fact.
[02:38:50.353 --> 02:38:53.374]  My enemies are your enemies.
[02:38:53.374 --> 02:38:54.095]  They're the globalists.
[02:38:54.095 --> 02:38:55.656]  They're exterminists.
[02:38:55.656 --> 02:39:13.824]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshippers, vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation.
[02:39:15.154 --> 02:39:24.496]  To change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[02:39:24.496 --> 02:39:31.818]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[02:39:31.818 --> 02:39:38.460]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the New World Order, but
[02:39:39.253 --> 02:39:41.336]  At the end of the day, it's all about the population.
[02:39:41.336 --> 02:39:42.517]  It's all about world government.
[02:39:42.517 --> 02:39:45.381]  It's all about the end of the human system as we know it.
[02:39:45.381 --> 02:39:47.423]  And all it's actually is a nightmare being built.
[02:39:47.423 --> 02:39:52.869]  Only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[02:39:52.869 --> 02:39:55.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:40:01.782 --> 02:40:06.745]  I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see.
[02:40:06.745 --> 02:40:12.189]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[02:40:12.189 --> 02:40:16.772]  I'm losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale.
[02:40:16.772 --> 02:40:23.696]  I've been interviewing Stuart Ruggs before Housekeepers even existed.
[02:40:23.696 --> 02:40:26.398]  And I've had dinner with him probably 20 times.
[02:40:26.398 --> 02:40:30.781]  And he's gone all over the country from the Bundy Ranch to what happened in Oregon to Austin, Texas and he's done
[02:40:31.616 --> 02:40:40.665]  Thousands of events I know of, probably 50 events I've been at or more, and he's always had great people and quality folks that aren't provocateur-ing around him.
[02:40:40.665 --> 02:40:50.415]  The Proud Boys, a lot of nice people, but it was so new, so big, they couldn't control it, and I'd say 95% good people, but they had some bad guys in there.
[02:40:50.415 --> 02:40:54.419]  Boogaloo's won a revolution, but they got some good people, some bad people in them.
[02:40:55.632 --> 02:40:58.477]  The Oath Keepers is what the system is really, really afraid of.
[02:40:58.477 --> 02:41:02.845]  That's why you saw senior retired FBI agents and senior military people in it.
[02:41:02.845 --> 02:41:04.007]  Because it's got a good mission.
[02:41:04.007 --> 02:41:05.470]  Stuart Rhodes is a smart guy.
[02:41:05.470 --> 02:41:06.973]  He won awards for his law work.
[02:41:07.842 --> 02:41:11.345]  For his papers, on these very type of scenarios we see right now.
[02:41:11.345 --> 02:41:15.127]  And I understand, Rhodes has gotten apocalyptic, and I'm being point-blank with him.
[02:41:15.127 --> 02:41:19.090]  He can be critical of me, you know, because I got mad at a lot of folks that went in.
[02:41:19.090 --> 02:41:20.411]  Just because they got suckered in.
[02:41:20.411 --> 02:41:25.415]  I get it, the left is burning down buildings, the left's killing cops, and they're little angel cakes and burning down whole neighborhoods.
[02:41:25.415 --> 02:41:31.759]  And his point is, a few hundred people are going to win out of a million, and we don't know who's innocent and who isn't, and so just back them 100%.
[02:41:31.759 --> 02:41:31.959]  I get that.
[02:41:33.826 --> 02:41:37.270]  I was just irritated because I saw how they used it against us.
[02:41:37.270 --> 02:41:49.646]  But regardless, we shouldn't just accept national gun confiscation, because Putin even called this a stroll down to the Capitol, and the Russians are making jokes about it, because they clearly see the police stood down.
[02:41:50.126 --> 02:41:51.247]  And so Stuart, I get it.
[02:41:51.247 --> 02:41:53.189]  America's being taken over by Chinese.
[02:41:53.189 --> 02:41:55.210]  They're butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:41:55.210 --> 02:41:56.732]  They're purging the military.
[02:41:56.732 --> 02:41:58.753]  Biden says he's going to confiscate the guns.
[02:41:58.753 --> 02:42:00.775]  They're coming out with forced inoculations.
[02:42:00.775 --> 02:42:02.216]  The borders are wide open.
[02:42:02.216 --> 02:42:06.239]  Yes, by any historical yardstick, we have every right to declare 1776 Part 2.
[02:42:06.239 --> 02:42:07.661]  I just instinctively look at that.
[02:42:10.803 --> 02:42:19.451]  And realize how they've set this up politically, and how they want a civil war so China can take over, and I'm really trying to get the governors of the political system moving to stop this.
[02:42:19.451 --> 02:42:24.096]  You may be right that there's no way to fix it, or is there a way to fix it?
[02:42:24.096 --> 02:42:28.019]  Because, you know, they're claiming you want violence, they're claiming you want offensive stuff.
[02:42:28.019 --> 02:42:35.586]  That's not the man I know, but at the same time, if we're attacked, we have a right and a duty to protect ourselves, so we're far past the Declaration of Independence point.
[02:42:35.586 --> 02:42:36.367]  Nobody can deny that.
[02:42:36.707 --> 02:42:44.063]  There's plenty of cowards in the government that are going to keep appeasing the system forever, but there is a point at which the globals are going to push where there is a breaking point.
[02:42:44.063 --> 02:42:45.947]  I don't want that breaking point, but it is approaching.
[02:42:47.495 --> 02:42:53.720]  Well, we're now on the same path the founders walked, and we need to look at their wisdom and do the same thing they did.
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:56.802]  And Jefferson and Madison told us exactly what to do.
[02:42:56.802 --> 02:43:03.308]  And it is nullification by the states and by your county governments and your sheriff, but also backed up by you.
[02:43:03.308 --> 02:43:11.194]  The most important office in this country is who is your local sheriff, and that sheriff means a posse of all the able-bodied men in the county behind you.
[02:43:11.674 --> 02:43:13.055]  That's the right way to do it.
[02:43:13.055 --> 02:43:16.496]  So yes, the states need to stand up and some are beginning to do that.
[02:43:16.496 --> 02:43:18.197]  But you also have to go down to the county levels.
[02:43:18.197 --> 02:43:22.379]  My encouragement to everyone out there is to become strong locally.
[02:43:22.379 --> 02:43:30.222]  Strong in your neighborhoods, strong in yourself, strong in your church, your town, your county, and come together so that you stand strong together.
[02:43:30.222 --> 02:43:32.303]  That's the wisdom of the founding fathers.
[02:43:32.303 --> 02:43:37.445]  They didn't hide in their homes waiting one at a time to be arrested by the bad guys.
[02:43:37.445 --> 02:43:38.326]  They got together.
[02:43:38.326 --> 02:43:40.827]  They didn't hide in their homes waiting for Q to save them.
[02:43:42.503 --> 02:43:43.963]  Or that, yeah.
[02:43:43.963 --> 02:43:47.804]  So you've got to come together and nullification at the local level is the right thing.
[02:43:47.804 --> 02:43:56.626]  Whether it's resisting election fraud, resisting on paper ballots, or whether it's resisting gun confiscation down the road, you need to come together.
[02:43:56.626 --> 02:43:58.827]  That's what you need to do.
[02:43:58.827 --> 02:44:03.568]  I admire you under this much pressure because you know they're criminally investigating me too and Roger Stone and the rest of it.
[02:44:03.568 --> 02:44:04.608]  I know it's all asinine.
[02:44:04.608 --> 02:44:05.568]  I used to laugh at Roger.
[02:44:06.128 --> 02:44:09.970]  When they said they were investigating him for Russiagate until they indicted him, and I was like, wow, this is real.
[02:44:09.970 --> 02:44:12.151]  Because I know we had no connection to the Russians.
[02:44:12.151 --> 02:44:13.832]  They criminally investigated me and my father.
[02:44:13.832 --> 02:44:16.053]  Everybody tried to get people to lie about us.
[02:44:16.053 --> 02:44:25.097]  That's really, I think, should be your biggest concern, is them trying to turn an Oath Keeper out of the thousands of members to lie about you when there's no evidence.
[02:44:25.097 --> 02:44:27.338]  But I don't think the American people will buy into that.
[02:44:27.338 --> 02:44:34.442]  Plus, the average Oath Keeper is of such good quality, I think they're going to have a major problem getting an Oath Keeper to bear false witness against you.
[02:44:35.911 --> 02:44:44.520]  Yeah, that's the obvious strategy is to try to force someone, you know, threaten them with 20, 30 years in prison, and try to force them, like you said, into making up lies.
[02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:47.363]  But hey, this is the fight we're in, and I'll deal with it.
[02:44:47.363 --> 02:44:48.243]  We're going to bear it.
[02:44:48.243 --> 02:44:49.685]  We're bearing it right now.
[02:44:49.685 --> 02:44:56.792]  I do want to plug one fundraiser for one of our men, and his wife actually, both Kelly and Connie Meggs.
[02:44:56.792 --> 02:44:58.093]  So if you can go to GiveSendGo,
[02:45:00.425 --> 02:45:01.006]  I think so.
[02:45:16.357 --> 02:45:23.041]  Right, givesamgo.com forward slash Megs and that is for Kelly Megs.
[02:45:23.041 --> 02:45:24.582]  He was our Florida team leader.
[02:45:24.582 --> 02:45:30.865]  They were assigned to do the PSD detail for the Stop the Steal people and his wife Connie.
[02:45:30.865 --> 02:45:32.006]  So, Kelly and Connie Megs.
[02:45:32.706 --> 02:45:48.893]  And if you want to also help Oath Keepers, go to OathKeepers.org forward slash donate and you can support the organization because we're going to have to hire lawyers to fight back against the defamation from Benny Thompson from Mississippi, the congressman, who's defamed us by calling us white supremacists, which is ridiculous.
[02:45:48.893 --> 02:45:53.595]  My vice president is a black cop out of Montana and our team leader on the ground in D.C.
[02:45:53.595 --> 02:45:55.556]  that day was a black cop.
[02:45:55.556 --> 02:45:59.998]  I mean, you were here with your buddy who's black just the other day, but a few weeks ago.
[02:46:00.949 --> 02:46:05.893]  But Stuart, it's well known that you're an anti-racist organization, pro-America.
[02:46:05.893 --> 02:46:10.016]  They call you a white supremacist everywhere on TV.
[02:46:10.016 --> 02:46:12.298]  Well, we're going to be suing them for defamation.
[02:46:12.298 --> 02:46:19.403]  They're going to get their comeuppance because we're going to sue them for defamation of character against all of our members.
[02:46:19.403 --> 02:46:22.625]  Probably tops about 60,000 total current and former members.
[02:46:22.625 --> 02:46:23.766]  So that's a class action.
[02:46:23.766 --> 02:46:26.228]  I mean, they've just called a 60,000 people white supremacist.
[02:46:27.558 --> 02:46:35.566]  Right, so we'll be suing him for that, and whatever money we get out of that, we're going to turn towards legal defense for all the people out there that are being persecuted.
[02:46:35.566 --> 02:46:36.627]  That's what we're going to do.
[02:46:36.627 --> 02:46:38.688]  Well, I admire the fact you're on the offense.
[02:46:40.007 --> 02:46:43.569]  Obviously, I've been advised by a lot of folks out there, hey, you better stay away from Stuart Rhodes.
[02:46:43.569 --> 02:46:44.489]  They're going to get him.
[02:46:44.489 --> 02:46:46.130]  They're going to get us all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:47.711]  This is a fight we chose.
[02:46:47.711 --> 02:46:48.591]  It's a takeover.
[02:46:48.591 --> 02:46:50.132]  And the globalists want America out of the way.
[02:46:50.132 --> 02:46:51.693]  They want us totally bankrupted.
[02:46:51.693 --> 02:46:53.074]  That's Joe Biden's job.
[02:46:53.074 --> 02:46:54.674]  Cut off our energy, open our borders.
[02:46:54.674 --> 02:46:55.435]  People don't get this.
[02:46:55.435 --> 02:46:58.716]  This isn't old-fashioned liberal undermining the pillars of the city.
[02:46:58.716 --> 02:47:01.117]  They intend to bring it down right now, Stuart.
[02:47:01.117 --> 02:47:05.480]  What do you predict the puppet of the chi-coms Biden and their beachhead in D.C.
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:06.120]  are going to do next?
[02:47:07.256 --> 02:47:13.903]  Well, I mean, I actually hope they go for a full-blown assault on this ban, because that's what's going to take the wake of most Americans up.
[02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:15.444]  So they need to see what's really happening.
[02:47:15.444 --> 02:47:17.886]  I think the faster they go, the better.
[02:47:17.886 --> 02:47:23.252]  Let them go ahead and take off the mask all the way, and declare your rights null and void.
[02:47:23.252 --> 02:47:26.995]  That way, Americans will finally rise up and stand up for their rights.
[02:47:26.995 --> 02:47:28.597]  And you're going to have to do it in your towns and counties.
[02:47:29.506 --> 02:47:30.406]  And your states.
[02:47:30.406 --> 02:47:37.109]  So I think you need to focus local on sheriff, who your mayor is makes a difference, your local judge.
[02:47:37.109 --> 02:47:41.511]  That's why they're scared because you peacefully reach out to local government, get them on board constitutionally.
[02:47:41.511 --> 02:47:45.932]  When all Biden's offering is bankruptcy and race war, clearly they stole the election.
[02:47:45.932 --> 02:47:48.553]  If they were smart, they would back off.
[02:47:48.553 --> 02:47:51.655]  They've got control and slowly keep running the country in the ground.
[02:47:51.655 --> 02:47:55.036]  I think it shows their weakness that they're accelerating this right now.
[02:47:56.224 --> 02:47:56.725]  Absolutely.
[02:47:56.725 --> 02:47:59.987]  And so I think, what we're seeing now is a suppression campaign.
[02:47:59.987 --> 02:48:09.295]  Like, we were interviewed by Gateway Pundit, and that article, that interview we did, myself and my attorney, has been suppressed across the board, across the internet.
[02:48:09.295 --> 02:48:15.339]  They don't want an alternative narrative to get out there, like telling the truth about who we are and what we did on January 6th.
[02:48:15.339 --> 02:48:19.503]  If you have a New York Times smear piece, that's not suppressed.
[02:48:19.503 --> 02:48:23.386]  But an actual video interview with me and our attorney is suppressed.
[02:48:23.386 --> 02:48:24.607]  That's what you're going to see going forward.
[02:48:24.947 --> 02:48:27.628]  People need to understand that they want you to turn on each other.
[02:48:27.628 --> 02:48:30.629]  I was pressured to disavow Oath Keepers.
[02:48:30.629 --> 02:48:37.590]  Our credit card processor shut us down, and they insisted that I must disavow any Oath Keeper that was arrested, and I refused to do it.
[02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:39.511]  Don't give in to that pressure.
[02:48:39.511 --> 02:48:42.872]  Absolutely, and we're going to put that article on screen from GatewayPundit.com.
[02:48:42.872 --> 02:48:44.352]  We're going to link it in the live show feed today.
[02:48:44.352 --> 02:48:49.413]  Exclusive interview, Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes speaks out after being demonized in a left Deep State video.
[02:48:49.413 --> 02:48:51.674]  They're going to try to suppress this interview as well.
[02:48:52.034 --> 02:48:54.017]  What would you want to call this?
[02:48:54.017 --> 02:49:03.030]  FBI person number one, leader of Oath Keepers, sets the record straight, or what should we call this interview?
[02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.811]  A badge of honor.
[02:49:04.631 --> 02:49:06.533]  So I'll take it as a badge of honor.
[02:49:06.533 --> 02:49:08.995]  That's when you know you're over the target and getting black.
[02:49:08.995 --> 02:49:11.698]  And hey, we're the canaries in the coal mine.
[02:49:11.698 --> 02:49:14.420]  Folks out there need to understand the real target is you.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:17.343]  Every Trump supporter, every patriot, they want you.
[02:49:17.343 --> 02:49:20.666]  They want you to be silenced and they want you to chill your own speech.
[02:49:20.666 --> 02:49:24.449]  They want you to help with your own demise by sitting down and shutting up.
[02:49:24.449 --> 02:49:24.810]  That's right.
[02:49:24.810 --> 02:49:26.111]  They know they stole the election.
[02:49:26.111 --> 02:49:27.172]  They're trying to intimidate us.
[02:49:27.172 --> 02:49:29.394]  That's the wrong action.
[02:49:29.394 --> 02:49:30.315]  Why are they so stupid?
[02:49:31.696 --> 02:49:32.216]  Yeah.
[02:49:32.216 --> 02:49:45.260]  Well, so what you need to do, we need to have, frankly, we need a Occupy Wall Street 2.0 that is both left and right, focused on the oligarchs at the very top versus we, the people, and understand what's really happening here.
[02:49:45.260 --> 02:49:46.820]  It's not about left and right.
[02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:48.480]  It's about the oligarchs versus us.
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:49.481]  And as you know.
[02:49:49.481 --> 02:49:54.862]  So I encourage us, I encourage everyone out there to look toward doing some kind of an Occupy Wall Street 2.0.
[02:49:54.862 --> 02:49:56.122]  No, I agree.
[02:49:56.122 --> 02:49:57.983]  And I'm asking you, what do you want to title this interview?
[02:49:59.644 --> 02:50:02.669]  Um, hey, title of interview, how about this?
[02:50:02.669 --> 02:50:06.616]  Title of interview, uh, Alexander Schultz and Neaton speaks out.
[02:50:06.616 --> 02:50:09.081]  America's Alexander Schultz and Neaton speaks out?
[02:50:10.089 --> 02:50:12.150]  Hey, I'll take that one.
[02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:16.092]  Person number one, America's Alexander Shultz and he needs to speak out.
[02:50:16.092 --> 02:50:18.513]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, we appreciate you.
[02:50:18.513 --> 02:50:19.493]  Be safe, my friend.
[02:50:19.493 --> 02:50:23.015]  You're totally innocent of everything except being a faithful, good American.
[02:50:23.015 --> 02:50:24.616]  Oathkeepers.org.
[02:50:24.616 --> 02:50:25.356]  Hope to talk to you soon.
[02:50:25.356 --> 02:50:26.537]  Come to the studio whenever you'd like.
[02:50:26.537 --> 02:50:27.817]  Come in here with your lawyer.
[02:50:27.817 --> 02:50:29.598]  I'd love to get you both on.
[02:50:29.598 --> 02:50:33.380]  And of course, that evil black fellow that's part of the organization you had with you here last week.
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:35.361]  All right, such white supremacists.
[02:50:35.361 --> 02:50:37.302]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:50:38.763 --> 02:50:42.707]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[02:50:42.707 --> 02:50:45.329]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[02:50:45.329 --> 02:50:46.089]  Why do you do that?
[02:50:46.089 --> 02:50:49.032]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[02:50:49.032 --> 02:50:50.854]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[02:50:51.843 --> 02:51:00.627]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[02:51:00.627 --> 02:51:00.887]  Boom!
[02:51:00.887 --> 02:51:01.288]  We did it.
[02:51:01.288 --> 02:51:01.788]  It's popular.
[02:51:01.788 --> 02:51:02.548]  It's X3.
[02:51:02.548 --> 02:51:03.789]  Is it better than X2?
[02:51:03.789 --> 02:51:04.449]  You decide.
[02:51:04.449 --> 02:51:05.910]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:10.072]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[02:51:10.933 --> 02:51:11.673]  Sleep Aid.
[02:51:11.673 --> 02:51:13.115]  And that is down and out.
[02:51:13.115 --> 02:51:14.356]  It's super strong.
[02:51:14.356 --> 02:51:16.258]  Way stronger than knockout.
[02:51:16.258 --> 02:51:17.800]  But they don't compete with each other.
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.682]  Different strokes for different folks.
[02:51:19.682 --> 02:51:20.502]  Different formulas.
[02:51:20.502 --> 02:51:24.987]  And it's 40% off out of the gates at InfoWareStore.com and free shipping.

[02:51:40.169 --> 02:51:43.938]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:51:43.938 --> 02:51:47.646]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:51:47.646 --> 02:51:50.252]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[02:51:50.902 --> 02:51:55.284]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:51:55.284 --> 02:52:01.027]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:52:01.027 --> 02:52:12.633]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:52:13.257 --> 02:52:15.378]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:52:15.378 --> 02:52:19.500]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:52:19.500 --> 02:52:30.104]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:30.104 --> 02:52:39.649]  Whether it's high-quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:40.289]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:42.865 --> 02:52:57.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:57.951 --> 02:53:03.234]  More and more you see it in the corporate dying dinosaur media.
[02:53:03.234 --> 02:53:07.155]  You're told don't ask questions, don't research, don't read the fine print.
[02:53:07.155 --> 02:53:10.117]  Just trust us.
[02:53:10.117 --> 02:53:11.037]  Anytime you hear that,
[02:53:12.330 --> 02:53:13.071]  It's a cult leader.
[02:53:13.071 --> 02:53:14.252]  It's somebody trying to abuse you.
[02:53:14.252 --> 02:53:15.593]  Somebody trying to hurt you.
[02:53:15.593 --> 02:53:20.097]  In some cases, somebody trying to rob you or kill you.
[02:53:20.097 --> 02:53:24.901]  There was a New York Times article a few weeks ago saying that critical thinking is a bad thing.
[02:53:24.901 --> 02:53:27.423]  You shouldn't do too much thinking.
[02:53:27.423 --> 02:53:28.183]  It's infectious.
[02:53:28.183 --> 02:53:28.784]  It's bad.
[02:53:28.784 --> 02:53:30.846]  You shouldn't read the vaccine inserts.
[02:53:30.846 --> 02:53:32.547]  You shouldn't look into Bill Gates.
[02:53:32.547 --> 02:53:34.909]  You should just trust what you're told by the New York Times.
[02:53:34.909 --> 02:53:39.493]  Well, Tracy Edwards, the president of the Long Island
[02:53:40.666 --> 02:53:49.135]  NAACP in New York, InfoWars.com has the article, has come out and said, don't read the insert.
[02:53:49.135 --> 02:53:50.096]  Don't ask questions.
[02:53:50.096 --> 02:53:56.703]  Just get it in your arm, a Joe Biden talking point, and you too can be an undead zombie.
[02:53:56.703 --> 02:53:58.625]  Here she is.
[02:53:58.625 --> 02:54:01.808]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[02:54:03.656 --> 02:54:08.940]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:14.284]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[02:54:14.284 --> 02:54:17.106]  The infusion!
[02:54:17.106 --> 02:54:31.197]  Oh, like the Clintons that for over a decade as governor and governess falsified the reports on the prisons and let them sell HIV and hepatitis positive blood to the entire world and to Bayer Pharmaceutical to put it in their Factor VIII blood product that gave over 2 million people
[02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:32.840]  Hemophilia?
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:38.802]  Hemophiliacs, HIV, and Hepatitis A, B, and C?
[02:54:38.802 --> 02:54:39.602]  You mean that?
[02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:45.944]  And there she is with Cuomo, the monster behind her, in this mask, saying, I'm not asking, I'm putting it in me!
[02:54:45.944 --> 02:54:48.905]  You too can be like Marvelous Marvin Hagler!
[02:54:48.905 --> 02:54:51.705]  You too!
[02:54:51.705 --> 02:54:56.167]  Can be like all the other people.
[02:54:56.167 --> 02:54:57.787]  Hank Aaron and others that are dying.
[02:54:57.787 --> 02:55:01.028]  And then they get caught all over the world.
[02:55:01.718 --> 02:55:05.559]  Not just here doing fake inoculations.
[02:55:05.559 --> 02:55:11.761]  Here, let's play that one more time as criminal investigations are launched in Italy after so many deaths.
[02:55:11.761 --> 02:55:16.583]  Here's this lady telling you, don't ask, don't look.
[02:55:16.583 --> 02:55:18.003]  I mean, imagine listening to this.
[02:55:18.003 --> 02:55:19.744]  Don't you even ask a question.
[02:55:19.744 --> 02:55:22.365]  And there's a bunch of white dudes with a black lady.
[02:55:22.365 --> 02:55:23.285]  They're puppeting.
[02:55:23.285 --> 02:55:26.646]  Here, get up there and tell them, I'm not asking, I'm not reading nothing.
[02:55:27.877 --> 02:55:29.539]  I'm just taking it.
[02:55:29.539 --> 02:55:30.380]  Don't read the fine print.
[02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:31.721]  Imagine you're there to buy a car.
[02:55:31.721 --> 02:55:33.943]  Oh, don't look at the fine print.
[02:55:33.943 --> 02:55:35.705]  Give me that check.
[02:55:35.705 --> 02:55:37.186]  But I'm not gonna.
[02:55:37.186 --> 02:55:38.047]  You want to see the contract?
[02:55:38.047 --> 02:55:40.470]  I'm sorry, you can't see that.
[02:55:40.470 --> 02:55:43.072]  Why, are you a conspiracy?
[02:55:43.072 --> 02:55:45.835]  No, no, no.
[02:55:45.835 --> 02:55:46.936]  Let's hear from that one more time.
[02:55:48.303 --> 02:55:51.867]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[02:55:51.867 --> 02:55:53.348]  Oh.
[02:55:53.348 --> 02:55:58.633]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[02:55:58.633 --> 02:56:03.758]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[02:56:03.758 --> 02:56:06.421]  That's right, you don't ask questions.
[02:56:06.421 --> 02:56:08.523]  We're not going to let you fly or have a job if you don't do it in the future.
[02:56:09.901 --> 02:56:12.482]  Oh, right here, Top Science says it'll kill you.
[02:56:12.482 --> 02:56:13.082]  Here's another one.
[02:56:13.082 --> 02:56:16.903]  NPR admits it'll make you breathe and create deadly viruses inside your body.
[02:56:16.903 --> 02:56:20.223]  See, the fine print's telling you, but it's not on national TV.
[02:56:20.223 --> 02:56:23.184]  Oh, Top Cancer Research Institute says it gives you cancer.
[02:56:23.184 --> 02:56:26.285]  Oh my gosh, look at this article right here.
[02:56:26.285 --> 02:56:27.105]  It goes on.
[02:56:27.105 --> 02:56:30.906]  Oh, I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[02:56:30.906 --> 02:56:32.646]  I'm not reading it.
[02:56:32.646 --> 02:56:34.487]  I'm saying put it in my arm right now.
[02:56:34.487 --> 02:56:36.467]  I'm not asking what's loaded in the revolver.
[02:56:37.248 --> 02:56:42.431]  I'm not asking if it's got bullets in it, just I'm sticking it to my head and I'm pulling the trigger.
[02:56:42.431 --> 02:56:47.033]  Let's hear it one more time.
[02:56:47.033 --> 02:56:50.235]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[02:56:52.086 --> 02:56:57.371]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[02:56:57.371 --> 02:57:02.095]  I am sticking out my arm, and I am taking the infusion.
[02:57:02.095 --> 02:57:07.139]  And I bet if you had a penis, you'd stick it in the garbage disposal, or in a wood chipper, or maybe in a light socket.
[02:57:07.139 --> 02:57:09.081]  Excuse me, but man!
[02:57:09.081 --> 02:57:14.566]  But that's who the NAACP has put in by the globalists 100 years ago to control black people, period.
[02:57:14.566 --> 02:57:15.847]  To make sure they abort your babies.
[02:57:16.499 --> 02:57:20.781]  Because I've been around, I protested a lot at abortion clinics, even before I got on air.
[02:57:20.781 --> 02:57:25.683]  And it'd always be some black woman or old black man walking up going, nobody wants these black babies.
[02:57:25.683 --> 02:57:27.644]  They're gonna get rid of these black people.
[02:57:27.644 --> 02:57:30.666]  They'd always be getting like a brand new Mercedes and drive off.
[02:57:30.666 --> 02:57:34.628]  They're the ones that oversee, like Renfield, the slaves.
[02:57:34.628 --> 02:57:42.311]  I'm not asking that you get in there and you take that shot and you roll over and die like a hero.
[02:57:42.311 --> 02:57:43.292]  Woo baby!
[02:57:44.202 --> 02:57:50.507]  I knew Trump was embattled.
[02:57:50.507 --> 02:57:58.054]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy.
[02:57:58.054 --> 02:58:00.076]  And a lot of people just couldn't believe it.
[02:58:00.076 --> 02:58:03.999]  They're like, oh no, it's 3D chess, 5D chess, he's invincible.
[02:58:03.999 --> 02:58:07.462]  And I understand why people wanted to believe that, because this is scary what's going on.
[02:58:07.462 --> 02:58:12.346]  The global government, the new world order, and now the people woke up to the fact that that's real, they want somebody to come save them from.
[02:58:13.081 --> 02:58:15.063]  Well, Trump sure as hell tried.
[02:58:15.063 --> 02:58:21.128]  My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once Biden signed that executive order.
[02:58:21.932 --> 02:58:23.153]  We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[02:58:23.153 --> 02:58:26.774]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed.
[02:58:26.774 --> 02:58:29.795]  And now people are going to feel the sting and the pain.
[02:58:29.795 --> 02:58:31.096]  The energy cost, everything else.
[02:58:31.096 --> 02:58:42.320]  But what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:44.201]  Because the fix is in, folks.
[02:58:44.201 --> 02:58:45.701]  The swamp is deep.
[02:58:45.701 --> 02:58:47.502]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[02:59:03.499 --> 02:59:14.047]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:14.047 --> 02:59:17.009]  Interviewed some children that were in facilities.
[02:59:17.009 --> 02:59:22.974]  The children described sleeping on the floor, being hungry, not seeing the sun for days.
[02:59:22.974 --> 02:59:31.881]  How is that acceptable for the Biden administration to keep children in those sorts of conditions, given the fact that he said you were an administration that was going to be more humane than the previous one?
[02:59:32.461 --> 02:59:36.523]  Well these, let me first say this is heartbreaking.
[02:59:36.523 --> 02:59:46.086]  It's a very emotional issue for a lot of people and it's very difficult and challenging and obviously these CBP facilities are not made for kids.
[02:59:46.086 --> 02:59:57.991]  So one of the reasons or a driving reason why the president has pushed to take all the actions that I outlined earlier when Phil asked the question is because we want to expedite getting these kids
[02:59:58.511 --> 03:00:10.879]  Out of the CBP facilities as quickly as possible and that's our goal and our objective and into shelters as quickly as possible then into sponsored homes while their cases are being considered and adjudicated.
[03:00:10.879 --> 03:00:19.464]  We are trying to work through what was a dismantled and unprepared system because of the role of the last administration.
[03:00:19.464 --> 03:00:25.828]  It's going to take some time but we are very clear-eyed about what the problems are and very focused on putting it forward to
[03:00:26.048 --> 03:00:48.180]  So, these are the people, ladies and gentlemen, that told all the illegals to come up here, tripled their number, 360 plus percent increase in fentanyl, a lot of these are kidnapped kids, the Senate report admits a lot of them get put in sex slavery, they're giving them to smugglers, and it all exploded under Biden and now they're blaming Trump.
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:50.141]  It's just absolutely insane.
[03:00:50.141 --> 03:00:53.003]  The people are showing up in Biden t-shirts, you've seen the videos.
[03:00:53.965 --> 03:00:59.729]  With hundreds of people wearing these shirts, thousands pouring across, it is totally insane.
[03:00:59.729 --> 03:01:13.118]  And they're saying climate change is causing it, when it was the COVID lockdowns that, when they interviewed people, say, we have no food, we're dying, we have to come here because of the COVID lockdowns, and they run right into the arms of Biden and the globalists that did it.
[03:01:13.118 --> 03:01:16.841]  I'm not even against these poor starving people, but it's going to bring us down too.
[03:01:16.841 --> 03:01:20.904]  And it was the COVID lockdowns, I told you a year ago, would trigger a giant migrant flow, and now they admit that.
[03:01:22.199 --> 03:01:25.160]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is a little late getting back to his studio in London.
[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:26.180]  He's getting there, getting set up.
[03:01:26.180 --> 03:01:32.062]  We're going to go to him in just a moment and hand the baton as he takes over the rest of this hour ahead of the warm at 3 p.m.
[03:01:32.062 --> 03:01:33.603]  Central in about 52 minutes.
[03:01:33.603 --> 03:01:36.003]  But first, please don't forget we're listener supported.
[03:01:36.003 --> 03:01:37.684]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:01:37.684 --> 03:01:39.465]  Plus, we've got great products you already need.
[03:01:39.465 --> 03:01:43.506]  You only have until Thursday morning and Storewide Free Shipping has to end.
[03:01:44.458 --> 03:01:47.199]  And all those big sales on all those items have to end.
[03:01:47.199 --> 03:01:50.681]  We're selling the Privacy Pockets at the lowest price ever at over 50% off.
[03:01:50.681 --> 03:01:52.321]  I want everybody to get them.
[03:01:52.321 --> 03:01:53.602]  And that has free shipping.
[03:01:53.602 --> 03:02:09.069]  The X2, the X3, the down and out sleep liquid formulas, the Supramel Vitality, the Knockout Sleep Support, Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultra 12, Vitamin B12 under the tongue, that's all 40 to 50% off with free shipping has to end on Thursday morning.
[03:02:09.069 --> 03:02:12.050]  Except for what's been sold out for three months back in stock.
[03:02:12.759 --> 03:02:17.780]  RainForce Plus, our great nootrobic, so popular, 50% off with free shipping.
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:19.021]  That will be our new sale.
[03:02:19.021 --> 03:02:23.102]  It's on sale now and will be extended because we got a lot of that great product in.
[03:02:23.102 --> 03:02:32.644]  But I tell you folks, you got to stock up now because DNAForce Plus, we ordered it back in September and we normally get it in two months.
[03:02:32.644 --> 03:02:36.225]  We still don't have it because of the breakdown of the supply chain and it's our flagship product.
[03:02:36.801 --> 03:02:43.164]  So, again, that's why it's so hard to get these products in, it's why we get limited amounts in, it's why stuff sells out so fast, and it's you supporting us.
[03:02:43.164 --> 03:02:47.947]  We're bringing enough money to stay on air right now, but just barely, so I want to thank you all for what you've done.
[03:02:47.947 --> 03:02:51.188]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:02:51.188 --> 03:02:58.892]  You can also support my dad's company, Dr. Jones Naturals, online, and that also is a sponsor and funds us as well.
[03:02:58.892 --> 03:03:02.574]  Okay, Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[03:03:02.574 --> 03:03:03.875]  Please stay with us.
[03:03:08.691 --> 03:03:15.615]  Welcome back to the Summit News Hour.
[03:03:15.615 --> 03:03:17.216]  We are live.
[03:03:17.216 --> 03:03:23.779]  We're going to get into the top story up on Summit News right now, which is about Spotify
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:57.048]  Crossing the Rubicon into yet another form of censorship with flashbacks of socialist realism, which was when under the Soviet regime only works of art that pleased and didn't offend Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime would be allowed to exist, would not be blacklisted, would be funded.
[03:03:57.048 --> 03:03:58.108]  We see this in Hollywood.
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:17.599]  We see it in mass culture in general and now we see it with song lyrics on Spotify where they're literally banning song lyrics and deleting entire tracks from playlists from major artists because of quote misinformation in the song lyrics pertaining to COVID-19.
[03:04:17.599 --> 03:04:20.622]  They're that petrified about anyone.
[03:04:21.331 --> 03:04:31.500]  Having any divergent view from the technocratic elites that the level of censorship is now down to literal song lyrics by popular artists.
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:35.303]  We're going to get into that a little bit later on in the show.
[03:04:35.303 --> 03:04:48.034]  First though, over the past week we've had yet another tragic incident being exploited for a new moral panic, for a whole raft of new laws that will do nothing to target the actual problem being raised by these activists.
[03:04:48.795 --> 03:04:54.958]  And will only seek and succeed if they get through in quashing more free speech.
[03:04:54.958 --> 03:05:02.783]  Headline up on Summit News, Club Stasi plan for undercover cops to patrol bars and clubs blasted.
[03:05:02.783 --> 03:05:14.609]  Now I remember in the early 2000s, early to mid 2000s, there was actually, under the Tony Blair government in the United Kingdom, discussion, plans being made to have undercover cops
[03:05:15.305 --> 03:05:26.531]  Literally sit in restaurants and bars to listen out for racist hate speech and then arrest people for their private conversations in restaurants and pubs.
[03:05:26.531 --> 03:05:34.396]  Of course last week we had the passage of a hate crime bill in Scotland which includes in its provisions they failed to get it shot down.
[03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:43.344]  The fact that hate crimes can be prosecuted if they arise from private dinner table conversations inside people's private homes.
[03:05:43.344 --> 03:05:49.488]  So this is not even anything that happens in public, anything that happens on the internet, anything that happens on the street.
[03:05:49.488 --> 03:05:52.009]  It's literally in private homes.
[03:05:52.009 --> 03:06:01.634]  Well now there's an undercover police officer planned to patrol bars and clubs in the UK to identify potential quote, predatory and suspicious offenders.
[03:06:02.535 --> 03:06:17.382]  And this is off the back of, as I said, the tragic murder, the abduction and murder of a 33-year-old woman called Sarah Everard, who went missing in Clapham, London, which is about 10 minutes that way from where I live.
[03:06:17.382 --> 03:06:22.345]  She was tragically abducted, murdered, it turned out, by a Metropolitan Police officer.
[03:06:23.388 --> 03:06:30.534]  She walked home at 9.30pm from Clapham to her home in Brixton after having visited a friend.
[03:06:30.534 --> 03:06:38.361]  That is not really a safe place to be walking for anyone, male or female, at 9.10pm at night.
[03:06:38.361 --> 03:06:43.165]  We have stabbings in London literally five minutes away from where I live.
[03:06:43.165 --> 03:06:44.546]  Mainly BAME on BAME.
[03:06:44.546 --> 03:06:49.751]  The stats show it's 75% black or ethnic minority people stabbing each other.
[03:06:50.683 --> 03:06:52.525]  That happens on a regular basis.
[03:06:52.525 --> 03:06:56.210]  It happens every weekend in massive numbers.
[03:06:56.210 --> 03:06:57.872]  Nobody gives a damn.
[03:06:57.872 --> 03:07:07.243]  One woman was tragically murdered and now we have this massive moral panic over street harassment, misogyny and the targeting of women.
[03:07:07.243 --> 03:07:09.786]  Now, what these feminists won't campaign for
[03:07:10.726 --> 03:07:14.428]  And by the way, they've been out protesting yesterday in Parliament Square.
[03:07:14.428 --> 03:07:21.612]  The government has hastily reacted to these protests by passing laws that do nothing to solve the problem and just target free speech.
[03:07:22.768 --> 03:07:42.162]  But none of the feminists, none of the special interest Soros groups, the Black Lives Matter groups that have hijacked this protest, have for one single second raised a solution that could actually help women protect themselves against violent predators on the streets, and that is to allow them to be armed.
[03:07:42.162 --> 03:07:49.567]  Not even with firearms, because even if you bring up that debate in the United Kingdom, you're shot down like an extremist, but in the United Kingdom,
[03:07:50.595 --> 03:07:56.217]  Women, and people in general, are criminalised from being able to engage in self-defence.
[03:07:56.217 --> 03:08:18.224]  It's illegal in the United Kingdom to carry pepper spray, and yet we have criminals carrying firearms, carrying knives, we have mass uncontrolled immigration from extremely dangerous areas of the world, people coming into London, and their level of violence is so much higher than the gangs that already exist in London, that those gangs are having to one-up them
[03:08:18.954 --> 03:08:21.696]  So the violence gets worse and worse and worse.
[03:08:21.696 --> 03:08:37.746]  But amongst all this, while the feminists screech for ACAB, and they screech for hate crime laws that ban misogyny, as if rapists, predators, murderers care about speech on the internet, they're going to attack women anyway.
[03:08:37.746 --> 03:08:41.888]  But there's no call to allow women to defend themselves.
[03:08:41.888 --> 03:08:43.189]  And that gets to the heart of it.
[03:08:43.189 --> 03:08:44.650]  We're going to get into it more after the break.
[03:08:44.650 --> 03:08:45.811]  Summit.News.
[03:08:45.811 --> 03:08:46.211]  Don't go away.
[03:08:47.202 --> 03:08:48.724]  The people are awakening.
[03:08:48.724 --> 03:08:51.447]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[03:08:51.447 --> 03:08:53.510]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:55.853]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[03:08:55.853 --> 03:09:05.224]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Comps especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[03:09:05.504 --> 03:09:14.107]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[03:09:14.107 --> 03:09:20.790]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:22.230]  In their own words, they admit it.
[03:09:22.230 --> 03:09:26.652]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[03:09:27.132 --> 03:09:29.093]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[03:09:29.093 --> 03:09:30.153]  They're Faraday cages.
[03:09:30.153 --> 03:09:31.853]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[03:09:31.853 --> 03:09:33.854]  They work absolutely great.
[03:09:33.854 --> 03:09:42.996]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.

[03:10:49.968 --> 03:10:52.630]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:59.477 --> 03:11:04.906]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:11:09.378 --> 03:11:19.301]  So we have yet another moral panic in the United Kingdom based off of one tragic incident which was the murder, the abduction and the murder of this 33 year old woman.
[03:11:19.301 --> 03:11:33.885]  The initial debate after she was abducted and it turned out sadly killed was that women should be able to walk the streets of major dangerous cities late at night without being stalked, without being harassed.
[03:11:34.205 --> 03:11:36.807]  Without being abducted, without being murdered.
[03:11:36.807 --> 03:11:38.908]  And yes, obviously that's the case.
[03:11:38.908 --> 03:11:45.313]  Of course anyone should be able to walk the streets late at night without that happening to them.
[03:11:45.313 --> 03:11:47.274]  The fact is, we don't live in a utopia.
[03:11:47.274 --> 03:11:57.221]  We don't live in the utopia created in the minds of leftists, where they think the biggest threat to them, the biggest threat to their personal safety, is mean words on the internet.
[03:11:58.078 --> 03:12:13.609]  Where they literally say that words are now violence, that opposing their arguments, that having a different opinion and bringing it to them in a forthright way is a form of harassment, which is the victimhood narrative that feminists now universally embrace.
[03:12:13.609 --> 03:12:16.371]  In their minds, they've created that utopia.
[03:12:16.371 --> 03:12:20.634]  The fact is, in the real world, it works very differently.
[03:12:20.634 --> 03:12:27.599]  I've made a number of videos now about not just young women, but couples, men and women,
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:33.225]  Who go abroad, who have this utopian vision of how the world should work in their heads.
[03:12:33.225 --> 03:12:39.692]  They think the biggest threat to their personal safety is mean words on the internet or the rise of fascism and Donald Trump.
[03:12:40.382 --> 03:12:49.467]  And then they actually go to dangerous areas of the world and tragically in many cases women are raped, women are killed, they travel alone.
[03:12:49.467 --> 03:12:59.792]  They literally read left-wing blogs on the internet saying it's safe for women to travel alone in, for example, hinterland remote areas of mountainous Morocco.
[03:12:59.792 --> 03:13:02.914]  That's happened with the two Scandinavian hikers.
[03:13:03.658 --> 03:13:08.959]  And of course, tragically, they're raped, they're beheaded by literal ISIS terrorists.
[03:13:08.959 --> 03:13:21.923]  And then you look back into their social media history, which I did, and people can try and frame this as gloating or trying to push your political agenda based off of tragedy of somebody being raped and murdered.
[03:13:21.923 --> 03:13:30.605]  No, we're literally trying to prevent that happening by simply pointing out that the world is a dangerous place, which is the title of the video I made a few days ago,
[03:13:31.388 --> 03:13:37.592]  And that people should be wary and have dangerous situational awareness about their surroundings.
[03:13:37.592 --> 03:13:59.487]  In fact, there have been several academic studies conducted, which I talked about in some of these videos, where conservatives have a way more heightened sense of situational danger awareness than leftists and liberals, because leftists and liberals, again, have been brainwashed that cultural relativism exists and that all cultures are equal.
[03:14:00.365 --> 03:14:01.106]  No.
[03:14:01.106 --> 03:14:16.376]  If you go to a tourist area of Venice, if you go to a beach in Florida, that's very different from hiking through remote regions of Morocco where literal ISIS terrorists exist and prosper.
[03:14:16.376 --> 03:14:21.700]  And in fact there was a famous couple that went cycling in Tajikistan
[03:14:22.327 --> 03:14:31.466]  And in fact the New York Times did a profile piece about them that ended up being, again, literally moaned down on the street and killed by ISIS members.
[03:14:31.466 --> 03:14:33.510]  Then we looked back at their blogs
[03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:36.089]  And they were traveling across the world.
[03:14:36.089 --> 03:14:45.291]  They were traveling through all these dangerous, untrammeled, uncharted territories for a couple of vegan liberals from San Francisco on their bikes.
[03:14:45.291 --> 03:15:03.855]  And if you read their blogs, they were absolutely shocked that people were being mean to them and that people weren't as welcoming as they were taught by the leftist mantra that tells them all cultures are equal and that they will be respected so long as they respect other people.
[03:15:04.375 --> 03:15:06.677]  Doesn't work like that in the real world.
[03:15:06.677 --> 03:15:07.878]  And this is the focal point.
[03:15:07.878 --> 03:15:14.283]  This is the nub of the situation we have with this debate in London in the UK right now.
[03:15:14.283 --> 03:15:21.849]  To the point where a lot of these special interest groups have hijacked the genuine concerns of women feeling unsafe on the streets.
[03:15:21.849 --> 03:15:24.391]  And let's be honest, it is a genuine concern.
[03:15:24.391 --> 03:15:25.172]  It does happen.
[03:15:25.951 --> 03:15:35.259]  Attractive women get harassed, get stalked, get followed home on the streets of major cities in the Western world.
[03:15:35.259 --> 03:15:53.355]  Now that happens across the board but you will notice that this kind of outrage that we've seen after this tragic death of 33 year old Sarah Everard was completely absent in the United Kingdom when we had massive grooming gang scandals where for example in one town alone in Rotherham
[03:15:54.378 --> 03:16:01.299]  Near Sheffield, where I used to live, 1400 girls were abducted and sold into sex slavery.
[03:16:01.989 --> 03:16:09.871]  And the local council, the local police force refused to properly investigate it because they feared they would be called racist.
[03:16:09.871 --> 03:16:14.872]  Because the people doing the grooming were almost entirely Muslim men.
[03:16:14.872 --> 03:16:28.116]  You saw no hashtags, you saw no vigils, you saw no petitions to the government, you saw no people lying down playing dead in the middle of Parliament Square after those grooming scandals came out.
[03:16:29.068 --> 03:16:30.949]  Not just in Rotherham, by the way.
[03:16:30.949 --> 03:16:40.511]  Rochdale, Telford, Huddersfield, Oxford, literally two dozen different towns, the exact same process took place.
[03:16:40.511 --> 03:16:55.596]  And there were even some horror stories about fathers who had found out that their young daughters had been trapped, had been sold into sex slavery, literally showing up at the houses of these groomers, these Muslim men, and then the police turned up and arrested the fathers.
[03:16:56.235 --> 03:17:11.545]  There was absolutely, in comparison to this, zero outrage, despite the fact that in total thousands of young girls were sold, trafficked into sex slavery, abused, their lives ruined forever.
[03:17:11.545 --> 03:17:22.653]  Yet we get one murder by somebody who is part of the Metropolitan Police, and because he's white, that gives them free reign to exploit it for all their other agendas.
[03:17:22.653 --> 03:17:23.133]  Which again,
[03:17:24.284 --> 03:17:30.546]  Is not to say that women don't get stalked, followed, harassed, cat-called on the street.
[03:17:30.546 --> 03:17:36.008]  Basically every semi-attractive female that I've ever spoken to has told me the same thing.
[03:17:36.008 --> 03:17:40.929]  They get followed, they get harassed, and that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable.
[03:17:40.929 --> 03:17:49.112]  But there's a difference between a builder wolf-whistling a woman and somebody abducting, kidnapping, and murdering a woman.
[03:17:49.112 --> 03:17:52.292]  There needs to be a line drawn between those two kind of behaviors.
[03:17:52.292 --> 03:17:53.853]  Not that one is acceptable,
[03:17:54.679 --> 03:17:57.001]  But there's a difference, there's a nuance there.
[03:17:57.001 --> 03:18:02.485]  But these activists really don't understand what the word nuance means.
[03:18:02.485 --> 03:18:18.619]  So now we have these bills in Parliament and now we have this plan by the government where they're literally going to, and this has already been green-lighted by the way, it's not even up for discussion because it was a knee-jerk reaction, where they're going to put undercover police officers in bars and clubs in the UK
[03:18:20.026 --> 03:18:34.291]  To watch people's behavior and to listen to their conversations and to try and figure out, in a kind of pre-crime minority report sense, if they're likely to be predatory individuals and if they're likely to harass women.
[03:18:34.291 --> 03:18:42.053]  Meanwhile, literally nobody is calling to give women the power to defend themselves against predators.
[03:18:42.053 --> 03:18:46.615]  They're trying to pass a hate crime law which makes misogyny a hate crime.
[03:18:47.443 --> 03:18:52.105]  Which of course they're going to apply to the internet, they're going to apply to free speech.
[03:18:52.105 --> 03:18:53.186]  Newsflash!
[03:18:53.186 --> 03:19:05.793]  Rapists and murderers who literally abduct and kill women off the streets of major cities don't give a damn if you pass a hate speech law saying that they can't be mean to a woman on the internet.
[03:19:05.793 --> 03:19:08.094]  And yet that's the upshot of this.
[03:19:08.094 --> 03:19:12.176]  They're talking about more CCTV surveillance covering the streets.
[03:19:12.176 --> 03:19:15.838]  And again, zero campaigning on behalf of these feminists.
[03:19:16.744 --> 03:19:20.947]  As to actually giving women the power to defend themselves.
[03:19:20.947 --> 03:19:37.658]  A woman caught carrying pepper spray, anyone caught carrying pepper spray in the UK, despite the fact that they may have a very good reason for doing so, if they feel they're in danger, they will get hit with the same legal penalties that they would get hit for carrying a shotgun in the United Kingdom.
[03:19:37.658 --> 03:19:41.060]  Of course, criminals don't care about laws, they'll carry any weapon they like.
[03:19:41.060 --> 03:19:42.261]  We'll be back.
[03:19:42.261 --> 03:19:43.462]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[03:19:46.425 --> 03:20:00.277]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in it together.
[03:20:00.277 --> 03:20:05.621]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:05.621 --> 03:20:06.322]  But it's true.
[03:20:06.322 --> 03:20:09.725]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:10.365 --> 03:20:10.605]  I think.
[03:20:25.552 --> 03:20:25.892]  Thank you.
[03:20:47.305 --> 03:20:55.532]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[03:20:55.532 --> 03:21:01.558]  This experience, this life on this planet is a reckoning.
[03:21:01.558 --> 03:21:10.445]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[03:21:10.445 --> 03:21:11.667]  And it really does come down to that.
[03:21:12.888 --> 03:21:20.279]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[03:21:20.279 --> 03:21:23.904]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[03:21:23.904 --> 03:21:26.168]  God is the author of us having free will.
[03:21:26.992 --> 03:21:30.673]  I sell supplements for two reasons.
[03:21:30.673 --> 03:21:35.935]  Because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a giant market.
[03:21:55.430 --> 03:21:57.932]  But again, why is there a giant market?
[03:21:57.932 --> 03:21:59.533]  Because it works.
[03:21:59.533 --> 03:22:01.515]  That's why it exponentially grows.
[03:22:01.515 --> 03:22:21.050]  So whether it's Saw Palmetto and other key ingredients in our Prostate Formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high-grade Organic Vitamin B12 in Ultra-12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA Force, or the pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine in X2,
[03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:30.182]  These are all the very best supplements you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there.
[03:22:30.182 --> 03:22:31.862]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[03:22:31.862 --> 03:22:36.283]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWars so you can't lose.
[03:22:36.283 --> 03:22:38.564]  InfoWars delivers in spades.
[03:22:38.564 --> 03:22:41.704]  Please visit InfoWarsStore.com and get the products today.
[03:22:41.704 --> 03:22:46.605]  And again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:46.605 --> 03:22:48.986]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[03:22:48.986 --> 03:22:49.766]  It's very bittersweet.
[03:22:50.720 --> 03:22:53.723]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[03:22:53.723 --> 03:22:54.965]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[03:22:54.965 --> 03:22:55.886]  But I don't care about that.
[03:22:55.886 --> 03:22:57.948]  I care about beating the new world order.
[03:22:57.948 --> 03:23:02.653]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[03:23:02.653 --> 03:23:06.017]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[03:23:06.017 --> 03:23:07.518]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[03:23:07.518 --> 03:23:08.720]  But let's just say this.
[03:23:08.720 --> 03:23:10.041]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[03:23:10.041 --> 03:23:12.504]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[03:23:13.104 --> 03:23:16.746]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[03:23:16.746 --> 03:23:19.327]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[03:23:19.327 --> 03:23:22.508]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[03:23:22.508 --> 03:23:23.369]  Do they fund freedom?
[03:23:23.369 --> 03:23:24.469]  No, a lot of them don't.
[03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:30.932]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[03:23:30.932 --> 03:23:32.653]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[03:23:32.653 --> 03:23:35.494]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[03:23:36.054 --> 03:23:39.176]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[03:23:39.176 --> 03:23:49.384]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[03:23:49.384 --> 03:23:51.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:04.105 --> 03:24:10.207]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:24:10.207 --> 03:24:30.954]  The other aspect of this story that I've been talking about with this hysterical moral panic after the tragic murder of this woman is of course the fact that we had anti-lockdown protesters in London and indeed across the United Kingdom getting thrown to the ground, getting whacked with batons, getting arrested and thrown in prison, getting hit with £10,000 fines.
[03:24:34.048 --> 03:24:38.170]  For almost the past year and nobody gave a damn.
[03:24:38.170 --> 03:24:52.119]  It was only when these feminists, and by the way I support their right to protest, it was only when these feminists got arrested, in a couple of cases got thrown to the ground, got manhandled, did this blow up in the media.
[03:24:52.119 --> 03:25:01.344]  We had an entire summer of Black Lives Matter protesters running roughshod through London, doing whatever the hell they wanted to, attacking police officers,
[03:25:01.986 --> 03:25:04.367]  desecrating war memorials.
[03:25:04.367 --> 03:25:06.708]  Nobody gave a damn about COVID.
[03:25:06.708 --> 03:25:09.649]  Nobody gave a damn about social distancing.
[03:25:09.649 --> 03:25:13.910]  Nobody gave a damn about, oh these are super spreader events.
[03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:22.673]  The only instances in which that narrative was applied was when anti-lockdown protesters were out on the streets of London.
[03:25:22.673 --> 03:25:24.074]  That was terrible.
[03:25:24.074 --> 03:25:25.314]  That was awful.
[03:25:25.314 --> 03:25:26.815]  They were killing granny.
[03:25:26.815 --> 03:25:27.735]  They were selfish.
[03:25:29.235 --> 03:25:36.178]  Meanwhile the cops were literally bowing to Black Lives Matter protesters while manhandling anti-lockdown protesters.
[03:25:36.178 --> 03:25:44.621]  The moment they do it to a couple of women up on Clapham Common, then it's absolute bedlam and it's apocalypse and we need laws.
[03:25:44.621 --> 03:25:48.262]  We need Stasi in pubs and restaurants and clubs.
[03:25:48.262 --> 03:25:56.665]  We need hate speech laws which ban misogyny on the internet, which at this point misogyny basically means disagreeing with a woman on Twitter.
[03:25:56.665 --> 03:25:57.846]  They claim it's harassment.
[03:25:58.809 --> 03:26:10.059]  So this only exploded after this one incident and after these special interest groups got their claws into these feminist protests in response to the tragic death of this woman.
[03:26:10.059 --> 03:26:17.927]  By the way, they were chanting ACAB, they were chanting No Justice No Peace, classic Black Lives Matter slogans.
[03:26:17.927 --> 03:26:22.351]  In fact, many of them had Black Lives Matter placards at a protest
[03:26:23.157 --> 03:26:24.838]  For the protection of women.
[03:26:24.838 --> 03:26:27.380]  What has that got to do with Black Lives Matter?
[03:26:27.380 --> 03:26:29.681]  It's been hijacked once again.
[03:26:29.681 --> 03:26:40.868]  Yet we went an entire year of anti-lockdown protesters being treated in the exact same way that these female protesters were treated upon Clapham Common.
[03:26:40.868 --> 03:26:41.989]  Nobody gave a damn.
[03:26:41.989 --> 03:26:43.409]  There was no moral panic.
[03:26:43.409 --> 03:26:45.891]  There was no mass media coverage.
[03:26:45.891 --> 03:26:48.332]  They deserved it because they were killing granny.
[03:26:48.332 --> 03:26:52.215]  Oh, but these people, because they have a different opinion and a certain cause,
[03:26:53.297 --> 03:26:55.058]  Well then it's fine.
[03:26:55.058 --> 03:26:59.862]  Complete double standard again because it's different special interest groups involved.
[03:26:59.862 --> 03:27:02.264]  In fact, Nigel Farage gave his commentary on that.
[03:27:02.264 --> 03:27:03.745]  We're going to go to that now.
[03:27:03.745 --> 03:27:05.446]  I'll come back and finish up with this story.
[03:27:05.446 --> 03:27:11.710]  But here is Nigel Farage on the tragic death of this individual and the moral panic that followed.
[03:27:11.710 --> 03:27:12.371]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:27:13.487 --> 03:27:17.991]  We're all rightly shocked and saddened by the abduction and murder of young Sarah Everard.
[03:27:17.991 --> 03:27:18.611]  We really are.
[03:27:18.611 --> 03:27:31.041]  I'm particularly surprised, I think, that the person that has been, and we mustn't prejudge this, but the person that has been arrested and charged is actually a member of one of the elite groups from the Metropolitan Police.
[03:27:31.041 --> 03:27:33.804]  And it has touched a chord.
[03:27:33.804 --> 03:27:34.004]  Note
[03:27:34.961 --> 03:27:41.726]  Kate turning up quietly, discreetly at Clapham Common yesterday and laying a couple of bunches of daffodils.
[03:27:41.726 --> 03:27:49.452]  What a contrast she is as a Duchess to the other Duchess that spoke to us last Sunday.
[03:27:49.452 --> 03:27:53.955]  But we're not just talking about abduction and murder.
[03:27:53.955 --> 03:28:03.622]  We're now beginning to talk more broadly about women being safe on the streets and in particular about the behaviour and attitudes of men.
[03:28:04.548 --> 03:28:08.824]  And that is why we saw the vigil taking place on Clapham Common.
[03:28:09.491 --> 03:28:13.034]  And the big round now is about the way in which it was policed.
[03:28:13.034 --> 03:28:16.876]  Several arrests and the police appearing to get quite heavy-handed.
[03:28:16.876 --> 03:28:19.538]  Indeed, Sadiq Khan demanding an inquiry.
[03:28:19.538 --> 03:28:24.221]  The Home Secretary, Priti Patel, demanding an inquiry as to how this was policed.
[03:28:24.221 --> 03:28:35.489]  Now, I do understand that because this is the very same police force who took the knee last year to BLM protesters who went on to desecrate some of our national monuments.
[03:28:35.489 --> 03:28:38.051]  So there does appear to be an inconsistency here.
[03:28:38.903 --> 03:28:46.490]  But there's a parallel with the BLM uprising last year, following the murder, the death of George Floyd.
[03:28:46.490 --> 03:28:49.552]  And it's one that I think we need to talk about.
[03:28:49.552 --> 03:28:59.001]  Following that BLM uprising, we've now had month after month of white people being told they are guilty.
[03:28:59.685 --> 03:29:02.686]  Those of us that are white, we have white privilege.
[03:29:02.686 --> 03:29:06.528]  And some of this nonsense is being taught in our schools.
[03:29:06.528 --> 03:29:08.688]  It isn't healing any racial divides.
[03:29:08.688 --> 03:29:14.491]  All it's actually doing is dividing black and white people and hugely counterproductive.
[03:29:14.491 --> 03:29:15.351]  And there is a danger
[03:29:16.835 --> 03:29:34.481]  But in the debate about this abduction and murder, and more broadly, how safe women are on the streets, all of which is a valid debate, there's a danger we go way too far in our criticism of men and broaden this out from bad people to men as a group.
[03:29:34.481 --> 03:29:39.003]  Just think of this from Baroness Jenny Jones in the House of Lords.
[03:29:39.739 --> 03:29:53.548]  I would argue that at the next opportunity for any bill that's appropriate, I might actually put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after 6pm, which I feel would make women a lot safer.
[03:29:53.548 --> 03:29:57.050]  And discrimination of all kinds would be lessened.
[03:29:57.050 --> 03:30:00.312]  Now, was she being altogether serious?
[03:30:00.312 --> 03:30:02.333]  Was she being provocative?
[03:30:02.333 --> 03:30:05.775]  Why, you might ask, are people like this even in the House of Lords at all?
[03:30:05.775 --> 03:30:08.377]  So perhaps we don't take that too seriously, but what about this?
[03:30:09.255 --> 03:30:21.660]  The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, being pressed by the BBC on whether he could contemplate in Wales putting that curfew in place for all men.
[03:30:21.660 --> 03:30:22.940]  Here he is.
[03:30:22.940 --> 03:30:29.342]  Some people have said sometimes that there should be a curfew on men for a period of time.
[03:30:29.342 --> 03:30:31.083]  Is that something that you would consider?
[03:30:35.276 --> 03:30:43.523]  It wouldn't be on the top of the list of things that we would consider, because it would be, at the very best, a temporary intervention.
[03:30:43.523 --> 03:30:48.467]  I'm sorry, to be clear, you say you wouldn't, it's not the top of your list.
[03:30:48.467 --> 03:30:58.114]  I can only take it from that, that you could not rule out that being potentially something that you would do.
[03:30:58.114 --> 03:31:02.598]  If it were a crisis, and you needed to take dramatic action,
[03:31:07.355 --> 03:31:12.077]  Yes, that's right.
[03:31:12.077 --> 03:31:28.065]  The First Minister of Wales, if there was a crisis, if there was a scare, something akin to the Yorkshire Ripper 40 years ago, or perhaps the Ipswich murderer who was on the run just a few years back, he would be prepared to bring into place a curfew for all men.
[03:31:28.797 --> 03:31:45.140]  Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, now telling us that men need to be educated better and that misogyny must become a crime so I can feel another hate crime, speech crime, thought crime perhaps coming down the track.
[03:31:45.140 --> 03:31:53.942]  And all of this is in danger of alienating men and saying that men as a group are dangerous.
[03:31:53.942 --> 03:31:55.002]  That's rather like saying
[03:31:55.774 --> 03:32:00.118]  Teenagers are dangerous because they might be carrying a knife.
[03:32:00.118 --> 03:32:01.159]  They might stab you.
[03:32:01.804 --> 03:32:06.306]  Or saying Muslims are dangerous, because they're all going to be jihadi terrorists.
[03:32:06.306 --> 03:32:16.090]  When it's not true in the case of teenagers, it's not true in the case of Muslims, and it certainly isn't true in the case of all men.
[03:32:16.090 --> 03:32:18.271]  Yes, there are some who behave terribly.
[03:32:18.271 --> 03:32:27.535]  We need to get a sense of perspective on this before we start rushing to legislation and teaching kids at school that it's wrong to be male.
[03:32:27.535 --> 03:32:30.977]  Because that, I fear, is where this debate is beginning to go.
[03:32:31.577 --> 03:32:35.178]  There are some bringing the voice of balance and reason to it.
[03:32:35.178 --> 03:32:37.999]  This is what Davida McCall had to say.
[03:32:37.999 --> 03:32:40.499]  And that's right, and that's sensible.
[03:32:40.499 --> 03:32:51.362]  We must not allow the tragic abduction and murder of this young woman to turn into something that would be to demonise men.
[03:32:51.362 --> 03:32:55.963]  We've just gone too far with all of this woke nonsense.
[03:32:58.382 --> 03:33:07.119]  There's Nigel Farage with his commentary on this issue and of course the main plank, the main point of this is that people have suddenly just realised apparently in the UK
[03:33:07.938 --> 03:33:09.899]  That we've lost the right to protest.
[03:33:09.899 --> 03:33:25.043]  And yet, many of the same people, the same leftists who support BLM, who support Extinction Rebellion, for example, were the same people who vehemently, if you look at the polls, supported this lockdown and still vehemently support it to this day.
[03:33:25.043 --> 03:33:31.345]  Even though at the very start of that, legislatively, that was the excuse they used to ban protest.
[03:33:31.345 --> 03:33:35.787]  But now, when they're actually enforcing it against protests that they endorse,
[03:33:36.813 --> 03:33:38.838]  Only now is it a problem.
[03:33:38.838 --> 03:33:41.303]  An incredible double standard.
[03:33:41.303 --> 03:33:41.964]  We'll be right back.
[03:33:41.964 --> 03:33:42.826]  Summit.News.
[03:33:42.826 --> 03:33:43.948]  Final segment coming up.
[03:33:43.948 --> 03:33:44.349]  I'll go away.
[03:33:45.774 --> 03:33:54.239]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:54.239 --> 03:34:04.785]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:34:04.785 --> 03:34:14.431]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:34:14.771 --> 03:34:15.472]  We're good to go!
[03:34:36.067 --> 03:34:38.168]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[03:34:38.168 --> 03:34:40.250]  But world government is only the control grid.
[03:34:54.660 --> 03:35:02.186]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and obtain immortality.
[03:35:02.186 --> 03:35:09.212]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[03:35:09.212 --> 03:35:11.454]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[03:35:11.454 --> 03:35:15.197]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[03:35:15.197 --> 03:35:16.398]  They are playing God.
[03:35:17.058 --> 03:35:26.943]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[03:35:26.943 --> 03:35:32.246]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[03:35:32.246 --> 03:35:34.687]  You have been warned.
[03:35:34.687 --> 03:35:39.149]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[03:35:39.149 --> 03:35:42.951]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[03:35:42.951 --> 03:35:45.172]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[03:35:48.513 --> 03:35:49.133]  We're good to go.
[03:36:22.003 --> 03:36:37.476]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that, and we're trying to stop it, and we should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[03:36:37.476 --> 03:36:39.618]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[03:36:39.618 --> 03:36:43.241]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[03:36:43.241 --> 03:36:44.903]  This is the truth.
[03:36:44.903 --> 03:36:46.264]  This is the Infowar.
[03:36:47.444 --> 03:36:49.205]  The Resistance, not video.
[03:37:01.690 --> 03:37:10.678]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Ban.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[03:37:10.678 --> 03:37:16.363]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[03:37:16.363 --> 03:37:19.847]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[03:37:20.607 --> 03:37:25.251]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[03:37:25.251 --> 03:37:27.193]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:37:27.193 --> 03:37:31.656]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[03:37:31.656 --> 03:37:42.265]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[03:37:42.265 --> 03:37:43.165]  Share the link.
[03:37:43.165 --> 03:37:44.767]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:37:44.767 --> 03:37:45.888]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:37:50.356 --> 03:38:00.710]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:05.076]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:29.068]  So we see this stunning irony of Blackfist vehemently supporting these very lockdown policies which entrenched power within governments and with censorship of criticism of lockdown, criticism of the vaccine, which entrenched power within giant transnational corporations, suddenly realizing
[03:38:29.728 --> 03:38:32.549]  That that has a negative knock-on effect.
[03:38:32.549 --> 03:38:43.495]  They've suddenly realised that they've lost the right to protest and that's why we saw the scenes on Clapham Common just a couple of nights ago with these feminists being manhandled.
[03:38:43.495 --> 03:38:46.756]  And they're pretending as if that's a new thing that's just suddenly appeared.
[03:38:46.756 --> 03:38:49.838]  No, you supported that from the very beginning.
[03:38:49.838 --> 03:38:56.361]  The Conservative government in the UK passed those laws where they literally banned the right to protest.
[03:38:56.821 --> 03:39:05.009]  In the name of stopping super spreader events, in the name of social distancing, in the name of preventing the spread of the pandemic.
[03:39:05.009 --> 03:39:09.774]  You have a Labour Party, a so-called Liberal Opposition Party in the United Kingdom.
[03:39:10.754 --> 03:39:18.920]  That again has vehemently supported and even called for more draconian censorship, more draconian banning of protests.
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:26.906]  And then you look at the polls in the UK and it's 80 plus percent of people, predominantly leftists, who supported that from the start.
[03:39:26.906 --> 03:39:31.009]  But now suddenly they're shocked that their protests are being banned.
[03:39:31.009 --> 03:39:38.475]  But only if their protests are being banned does it become a problem when they literally signed on from it from the very beginning.
[03:39:39.099 --> 03:39:44.081]  And this is now expressing itself in terms of censorship with art.
[03:39:44.081 --> 03:39:58.908]  We now have Spotify, and the headline is Spotify now censoring song lyrics that contain misinformation, literally deleting tracks by major artists from their platform that criticize lockdown, that question the vaccine.
[03:39:58.908 --> 03:40:08.133]  And in this case, it's Ian Brown, who is probably one of the biggest frontmen in the United Kingdom throughout the 80s and the 90s with the Stone Roses,
[03:40:08.797 --> 03:40:11.780]  Now, of course, with his solo career.
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:21.748]  In a flashback to how art that offended the Soviet regime was blacklisted, streaming giant Spotify is now censoring song lyrics that contain, quote, misinformation.
[03:40:21.748 --> 03:40:23.429]  What is misinformation?
[03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:29.174]  Anything that offends the technocratic elites, the scientific dictatorship.
[03:40:29.174 --> 03:40:36.720]  Ian Brown revealed that Spotify deleted his anti-lockdown song, Little Seed, Big Tree, which was originally released last September,
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:50.625]  He tweeted a couple of days ago, quote, Spotify streamed the streams and sends the artists like they have with my last song, took it down, just put it down the memory hole, free expression as revolution.
[03:40:50.625 --> 03:40:55.427]  And if you read the song lyrics to this track, he's basically talking about lockdowns.
[03:40:55.427 --> 03:40:57.988]  He's talking about mandatory vaccines.
[03:40:57.988 --> 03:41:01.890]  And again, Brown has been a vehement voice against lockdown and mandatory vaccines.
[03:41:02.811 --> 03:41:17.868]  Since basically the start, since a year ago when it first came into effect, in fact he said numerous times that he will refuse to perform at music venues that mandate proof of Covid-19 vaccination as a condition of entry.
[03:41:17.868 --> 03:41:23.955]  And that started off with him trending on Twitter and being bashed by many of these same people
[03:41:24.713 --> 03:41:28.276]  Who are now suddenly so shocked that they've lost the right to protest.
[03:41:28.276 --> 03:41:34.481]  Many of them criticised Ian Brown for his anti-lockdown stance.
[03:41:34.481 --> 03:41:38.163]  And in fact Spotify put out a statement after they deleted his track.
[03:41:38.163 --> 03:41:45.129]  They said Spotify prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous, false, deceptive or misleading content about COVID-19.
[03:41:45.129 --> 03:41:47.771]  So they're literally banning art
[03:41:48.692 --> 03:41:53.135]  Which contradicts the narrative of the technocratic elite.
[03:41:53.135 --> 03:42:03.923]  It's not just political opinions, it's not just their narrow definition of hate speech, which is basically criticism of anyone who they can identify as a minority group.
[03:42:03.923 --> 03:42:07.485]  Now it's literally art, it's literally music.
[03:42:07.485 --> 03:42:10.067]  Now if you go back in history, we've seen this before.
[03:42:10.882 --> 03:42:21.428]  As I write in the article, it's a continuation of enforcing a monoculture of thought by ensuring any form of art that carries a message which offends technocratic elites is blacklisted.
[03:42:21.428 --> 03:42:25.391]  Because if you go back to the Soviet Empire, under old Uncle Joe,
[03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:37.684]  Art wasn't allowed to be publicly displayed, it wasn't allowed to be state-funded, unless it carried the same political message as the Soviet regime, as the Soviet elite.
[03:42:37.684 --> 03:42:40.525]  It was called socialist realism.
[03:42:40.525 --> 03:42:44.487]  It was the prescribed style of idealized art.
[03:42:44.487 --> 03:42:53.150]  This meant that every sculpture, statue and painting had to conform to an established aesthetic in order to, quote, educate citizens on how to be the perfect Soviets.
[03:42:53.852 --> 03:43:09.960]  In order to entrench loyalty to the Communist Party and advance the utopian image of Soviet society, the purpose of socialist realism was to limit popular culture to a specific highly regulated faction of emotional expression that promoted Soviet ideals.
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:10.781]  So again, it's about
[03:43:11.764 --> 03:43:25.044]  Only incentivising art, music that can be created, that can even become public and accessible to the general public by carrying a woke, diverse social justice message.
[03:43:25.044 --> 03:43:27.968]  And as an artist, people know that if it doesn't
[03:43:28.726 --> 03:43:33.849]  Have a kind of tokenism that gives a nod to that, even if it's not genuinely meant.
[03:43:33.849 --> 03:43:36.370]  It's never going to get exposed to the public.
[03:43:36.370 --> 03:43:42.973]  And as an artist, as a musician, they're going to fail because they're not towing the party line.
[03:43:42.973 --> 03:43:46.895]  And it was literally the party line back in Soviet days.
[03:43:46.895 --> 03:43:53.658]  Now it's the party line of the hashtag diversity woke technocratic elite.
[03:43:53.658 --> 03:43:55.079]  And in fact, I wrote an article
[03:43:56.209 --> 03:44:04.034]  I think it was last year, in fact it's here, headline, new purity test tool to scan Hollywood scripts for diversity bias?
[03:44:04.034 --> 03:44:17.762]  Major Hollywood studios are set to use a new tool that scans movie and TV scripts and flags up any examples where diversity is not portrayed positively in a chilling new development that has echoes of Soviet realism.
[03:44:17.762 --> 03:44:20.804]  So again, we saw for example with the Brits,
[03:44:21.727 --> 03:44:28.452]  They came out publicly and said, oh, the BRIT nominations, the British Film Awards, is majority non-white.
[03:44:28.452 --> 03:44:31.494]  It's majority ethnic minority.
[03:44:31.494 --> 03:44:49.708]  Even though the population of the United Kingdom, at last count, was 86% white, so if you truly wanted a meritocratic, equality-driven representation of artists in the form of those nominations, they wouldn't be majority BAME, they wouldn't be ethnic minority.
[03:44:49.708 --> 03:44:50.809]  This isn't equality
[03:44:51.494 --> 03:44:55.116]  This is racist discrimination.
[03:44:55.116 --> 03:44:58.779]  But again, this is why these artists never speak out in the first place.
[03:44:58.779 --> 03:45:15.349]  This is why these artists, these musicians, these film directors, these actors and actresses, can't even remain neutral on a political subject without being chased by the pitchfork mob, the woke, cancelled culture mob.
[03:45:16.167 --> 03:45:18.949]  So they've done it for Hollywood scripts.
[03:45:18.949 --> 03:45:20.129]  They've done it for art.
[03:45:20.129 --> 03:45:28.294]  You're not going to get your art in an art gallery now unless it has some kind of tokenist nod to political correctness, diversity, social justice.
[03:45:28.294 --> 03:45:31.916]  And now Spotify is doing it with song titles.
[03:45:31.916 --> 03:45:44.222]  They're now literally deleting songs which offend the sensitivities of the technocratic elite when it comes to the vaccine program and when it comes to social distancing, when it comes to the COVID-19 lockdowns.
[03:45:46.181 --> 03:45:49.024]  And on that subject, we have another headline here.
[03:45:49.024 --> 03:45:54.509]  Professor warns post-corona society is a national obedience contest.
[03:45:54.509 --> 03:46:06.160]  This is a Norwegian psychology professor called Charlotte Reed, who warns that our post-corona society has turned into a national obedience contest that will have a devastating effect on mental health for years to come.
[03:46:07.051 --> 03:46:09.713]  You know, everyone's really concerned about mental health.
[03:46:09.713 --> 03:46:18.559]  We've seen this phenomenon over the past five, six years, where people say, oh, there's such a big stigma around mental health.
[03:46:18.559 --> 03:46:23.042]  The reason why it's getting worse is because we're not talking about it.
[03:46:23.042 --> 03:46:27.325]  And yet it seems the more we talk about it, the worse it gets.
[03:46:27.325 --> 03:46:35.090]  And that's why you get many people who go to university and they want to identify as being mentally ill because they think it makes them unique.
[03:46:36.167 --> 03:47:01.404]  When in fact, if you look at Stoicism, if you look at the classic example of the British stiff upper lip, we live in a society that is now emotionally incontinent, where we're supposed to be vulnerable, harassed under constant attack for having our opinions challenged, to the point now where, for example, in Kew Gardens, and this is another headline, Kew Gardens to tell visitors how racist its plants are,
[03:47:02.483 --> 03:47:05.007]  Yeah, this is the actual story, this is not The Onion.
[03:47:05.007 --> 03:47:11.778]  Kew Gardens in London is to change labels on its plants and flowers in order to inform visitors on how racist they are.
[03:47:11.778 --> 03:47:14.883]  So now we're so precious, we're so ashamed.
[03:47:15.518 --> 03:47:28.728]  Of our culture, of our heritage, that they're now telling people that sugar canes were a result of slavery, and that we now have to label this, we now have to genuflect, we now have to bow our heads in shame.
[03:47:28.728 --> 03:47:38.535]  All these plants are going to be labeled as racist, despite the fact that the Brits were literally the first people in the modern world to ban slavery.
[03:47:38.535 --> 03:47:43.599]  Slavery still exists in numerous countries across the world, throughout India, throughout the Middle East.
[03:47:44.278 --> 03:47:48.303]  Many of those countries, in fact the vast majority, are non-white countries.
[03:47:48.303 --> 03:47:50.906]  That's the problem in terms of modern day slavery.
[03:47:50.906 --> 03:47:56.453]  But no, the solution apparently is to label sugar cane plants racist.
[03:47:56.453 --> 03:47:58.435]  That's really going to solve it.
[03:47:59.835 --> 03:48:13.423]  The good news is that the actual culture that's being pushed in replacement of actual authentic culture like Ian Brown and his anti-lockdown song, which has now been banned on Spotify, is being rejected in greater and greater numbers.
[03:48:13.423 --> 03:48:15.104]  Headline out of Information Liberation.
[03:48:15.104 --> 03:48:17.225]  Grammy ratings hit record low.
[03:48:17.225 --> 03:48:19.086]  Viewership crashes over 50% from last year.
[03:48:20.911 --> 03:48:29.640]  You have Cardi B and all these other degenerate artists training young girls to twerk, training them to become, basically, uh, prostitutes.
[03:48:29.640 --> 03:48:31.102]  That's being rejected.
[03:48:31.102 --> 03:48:34.565]  But Ian Brown's song, which is anti-lockdown, that has to be deleted.
[03:48:34.565 --> 03:48:35.286]  That's gonna wrap it up.
[03:48:35.286 --> 03:48:35.907]  Summit.News.
