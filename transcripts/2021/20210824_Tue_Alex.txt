[00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.000]  Our ancestors have passed on.
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.061]  They can see clearly what's going on.
[00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.542]  They didn't create us to just sit around and do nothing.
[00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:18.268]  And given the fact that this is a war, it's the responsibility of parents to shield their children from the bullets and the gunfire.
[00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:22.810]  This is a civilization-level design collapse in their own words.
[00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.310]  You're right.
[00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.431]  We're in the middle of a giant war.
[00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.812]  All that matters is winning this war right now.
[00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:29.413]  That's right.
[00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:37.070]  That's the way that I see it, because again, there are too many people sending their own children into the slaughterhouse, so to speak.
[00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:45.519]  And as it's been said on your show, I'm sure a million times, by the time you smell the blood of the sheep in front of you, it's too late!
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.845]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:54.768]  We're good.
[00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:23.271]  17-year-old Shamsu undergoes a DNA test to prove he's a victim of a failed drug trial by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer that happened 15 years ago in Kano State, Nigeria.
[00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:30.954]  11 children were killed and several more injured when Pfizer tested out a drug called Trovan on 200 children.
[00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:35.376]  The drug was supposed to treat a deadly regional outbreak of meningitis.
[00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:41.540]  Pfizer agreed to pay 75 million dollars in compensation in 2009.
[00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.282]  Have you taken the vaccine, sir?
[00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:51.568]  No, I haven't taken it yet and we are having an ethical committee dealing with the question of who is getting it.
[00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:59.855]  So they're going to plan on getting FDA approval for the COVID vaccine next week so they can try to push all these mandates on everybody because they're going to tell you how safe and effective it is.
[00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:01.056]  Well, guess how they did it?
[00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:12.246]  They got a woman named Janet Woodcock, who is the chief of the Center of Drug Evaluation Research, and they put her as the acting head of the FDA to give her the approval status.
[00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:17.572]  And this woman is personally responsible for approving both OxyContin
[00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:32.756]  Which is causing a friggin epidemic and fentanyl, the two most dangerous drugs on the market today that got approved by this woman, Janet Woodcock, who's now going to be approving our COVID vaccines so they can push everybody with mandates.
[00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:39.678]  This would tip businesses and colleges to consider mandating the vaccine once it gets full approval.
[00:02:39.698 --> 00:02:41.418]  Would you urge them to do that?
[00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:43.339]  I think it's a very reasonable thing to do.
[00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:57.671]  The FDA has now granted full approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, making it the first COVID vaccine to transition from emergency authorization status to full FDA approval.
[00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:59.512]  This is a game-changing moment.
[00:02:59.552 --> 00:03:03.676]  We've been waiting for this for a long time, to have the full approval of vaccine.
[00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:04.497]  We now have it.
[00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:10.622]  This helps us move forward, and we're moving forward with our schools with this new vaccine mandate.
[00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:22.624]  After a strict process, the FDA has reaffirmed its findings that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and the FDA has given its full and final approval.
[00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:26.385]  So let me say this loudly and clearly.
[00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:39.188]  If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened.
[00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:42.026]  The moment you've been waiting for is here.
[00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:46.828]  It's time for you to go get your vaccination and get it today.
[00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:57.213]  Today I'm calling on more country, more companies I should say, in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people.
[00:03:58.274 --> 00:04:08.759]  If you're a business leader, a non-profit leader, a state or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I'm calling you now to do that.
[00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.419]  Require it.
[00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:11.892]  Do what I did last month.
[00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:16.194]  Require your employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.
[00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:18.395]  This is right out of the federal government's own numbers.
[00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:20.056]  Daily report trends.
[00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:21.116]  Romania.
[00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:23.958]  How do we explain this situation in Romania?
[00:04:23.978 --> 00:04:26.339]  25% of the population vaccinated.
[00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:29.361]  Cases and deaths plummeting to basically zero.
[00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:30.901]  Or the lowest in the world.
[00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:33.223]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:34.803]  They got 27% taking the vaccine.
[00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:37.545]  No one is in the hospital now that
[00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:39.156]  It's unvaccinated.
[00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:44.018]  Now, what's happening in the most vaccinated state in the United States?
[00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.060]  Current hospitalizations, Hawaii.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.703]  You can see the mask mandate and the inoculations all starting right here.
[00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:56.724]  And what happens right when they start the shots?
[00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:03.667]  Hospitalization spike, but it takes a while for mutations to grow and to get out into the population.
[00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:07.149]  And then suddenly, look at that spike.
[00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:32.830]  We're talking millions in France, millions in Australia, overrunning the police, overrunning the shopping malls, the grocery stores, saying no to the COVID checkpoints, saying they know it's the Great Reset, they're chanting
[00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:36.632]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:59.443]  Despite all the censorship and all the attacks thanks to our incredible listeners across the planet from every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love liberty, we are still number one transmitting the truth on a planetary scale.
[00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:01.644]  It's Tuesday, August 24th.
[00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:07.048]  The year is 2021, and we are now inside the vaunted New World Order.
[00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:15.974]  And it's just going to get a lot crazier from here on out.
[00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.372]  Okay, you're going to see the best of people, we're going to see the worst of people now.
[00:06:22.373 --> 00:06:30.697]  There is incredibly beautiful opposition to the clear tyranny of 1984 proportions that is taking place across the world.
[00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:33.539]  And you're going to find out who's for slavery and who isn't.
[00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:36.389]  Now, I don't lionize Bill Maher.
[00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.029]  I've been a big enemy of Bill Maher.
[00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:40.170]  We had listeners take over.
[00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.610]  I mean, I didn't do it.
[00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.011]  I didn't order him to do it, but he blamed me, so I took the blame.
[00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:46.211]  I mean, I said, yeah, I support it.
[00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:51.333]  Take over his live studio audience a couple times, exposing Building 7 and the fact that it was blown up.
[00:06:53.254 --> 00:07:00.941]  But when he gets things right and comes out and says, don't block Ivermectin, don't censor the internet, don't censor Alex Jones, Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:07.367]  When he comes out and says, Google lied to us about the Wuhan lab and shouldn't be censoring.
[00:07:07.907 --> 00:07:09.228]  When he comes out and says, look,
[00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.290]  I took the vaccine.
[00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:12.832]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:07:13.292 --> 00:07:15.454]  And then I got COVID really bad after I took it.
[00:07:16.014 --> 00:07:17.095]  He knows he got sick from it.
[00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:19.878]  And quite frankly, Maher looks 10 years older since he took it.
[00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:20.939]  I'm not putting him down.
[00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.439]  It's just true.
[00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:22.760]  And I think he's pissed off about it.
[00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:25.263]  Just like all these other people that have taken it.
[00:07:25.603 --> 00:07:30.007]  How many prominent people have taken it because they wanted to get the economy back going?
[00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:31.748]  They believe the carrot
[00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:33.286]  I don't know.
[00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:53.952]  Pull it out of yesterday's stack.
[00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:54.613]  I forgot to cover it.
[00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:57.353]  It's a whole stack on it.
[00:07:57.373 --> 00:08:10.336]  90 major organizations, is the headline, ask Apple to stop saying they're going to scan everything on your phone every few milliseconds and read what you write and text and scan your photos to make sure you're not a pedophile or a criminal.
[00:08:11.176 --> 00:08:12.757]  And Milmar said the same thing last week.
[00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:13.057]  He said,
[00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:14.714]  He has great analogies.
[00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:15.975]  I mean, I'd love to get him on our side.
[00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:16.815]  He's super smart.
[00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:19.938]  He said, that'd be like buying a safe for your house.
[00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.141]  And they go, oh, we're going to drop by sometimes and just make sure there's not child porn in it.
[00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.542]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:08:26.823 --> 00:08:27.383]  What does that mean?
[00:08:27.403 --> 00:08:28.865]  You got your passport.
[00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:29.805]  You got guns in there.
[00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:31.527]  You got insurance policies and stuff.
[00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:33.068]  Oh, well, we need to look.
[00:08:33.768 --> 00:08:35.089]  We need to see what's in there.
[00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:38.532]  This is the creed of slaves.
[00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:42.015]  I mean, another analogy would be, all houses must be made out of glass.
[00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.973]  And you must keep your lights on all night long in case you try something in the dark.
[00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.856]  Do not look at the sun.
[00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:53.357]  Do not leave your house.
[00:08:53.397 --> 00:08:54.717]  Do not talk to your neighbors.
[00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.399]  Do not look them in the eye.
[00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:01.822]  That's being said in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain.
[00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:08.146]  You're like, well, that sounds like Jim Jones to the order of a hundred.
[00:09:09.647 --> 00:09:13.210]  And yeah, that's real cult programming.
[00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:18.753]  Because the globalists want you to do something that doesn't make sense and destroys you.
[00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:24.335]  So we have got just insane things going on.
[00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:34.500]  Brett Favre, famous NFL quarterback, they snuck it in on CNN when he was talking about
[00:09:35.953 --> 00:09:37.914]  Concussions that, hey, do you support the vaccines?
[00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:39.674]  And basically said no.
[00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:41.915]  So now they're all freaking out about that.
[00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:44.136]  I mean, people do their own research.
[00:09:44.156 --> 00:09:48.177]  They're not stupid, especially at that level of competition.
[00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:51.918]  And the studies are out.
[00:09:51.979 --> 00:10:01.502]  The more educated you are, the higher your income, the more you don't want these shots because you go read that they've got liability protection.
[00:10:02.773 --> 00:10:13.916]  That all the top scientists are warning it's going to hurt you, that they did secret animal trials trying to get this approved before and it killed most of the animals, and now there's all this carnage, and they still just want to stampede us into this.
[00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:15.056]  It's insane.
[00:10:15.877 --> 00:10:18.377]  So now they've got... Let's just play it back to back.
[00:10:18.397 --> 00:10:20.818]  Here's Bill Maher, then we'll play Brett Favre.
[00:10:22.518 --> 00:10:26.380]  Now they want us to do all these boosters we were talking about with Andrew.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.941]  I mean, I don't want a booster.
[00:10:28.181 --> 00:10:29.842]  Look, I never wanted the vaccine.
[00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.122]  I took one for the team.
[00:10:32.383 --> 00:10:35.324]  And that's, and by the way, you know who doesn't get a lot of vaccines?
[00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:36.505]  Millennials.
[00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:37.525]  I know a lot of Millennials.
[00:10:37.765 --> 00:10:38.626]  Especially the 20, 20-year-olds.
[00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:39.887]  They don't want it.
[00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:40.507]  They don't want it.
[00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:41.347]  They don't think they need it.
[00:10:41.387 --> 00:10:42.228]  They're probably right.
[00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:44.409]  But I tell them, I didn't want it either.
[00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:45.989]  I took one for the team.
[00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.632]  But a boost, but every eight months they're going to put this shit in me?
[00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.511]  I don't know about that.
[00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.874]  Maybe I don't need one.
[00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.957]  I don't want a one-size-fits-all.
[00:10:56.758 --> 00:10:58.661]  My body may be different than your body.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.561]  Yeah, I lost you, man.
[00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:02.221]  That's crazy.
[00:11:02.642 --> 00:11:03.882]  My body isn't different.
[00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:05.783]  Everybody's body isn't somewhat different.
[00:11:05.803 --> 00:11:08.045]  I just read the statistics about who dies from this.
[00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:10.366]  You're trying to be cute and you're rolling the dice.
[00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:11.246]  I'm not trying to be cute.
[00:11:11.326 --> 00:11:12.507]  No, I know I'm in your house.
[00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:14.288]  I don't want to step over the line here.
[00:11:14.328 --> 00:11:18.490]  But genuinely, genuinely, people's lives are on the line.
[00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:24.333]  And just as significantly, our very way of life is on the line here.
[00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:27.075]  It's very important that people get vaccinated.
[00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:28.556]  He's going to yell at him in a minute.
[00:11:29.036 --> 00:11:33.038]  But look at this Democrat slimeball know-it-all who says, oh, are you crazy?
[00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:33.878]  Are you serious?
[00:11:33.898 --> 00:11:35.219]  That's his intellectual argument.
[00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:39.881]  Hey, your buddy Fauci cooked it up at the lab with Bill Gates and the Chai Coms.
[00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:41.241]  They released it.
[00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.503]  They then suppressed treatments for it.
[00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:50.386]  You're signed on to a pack of murderers that own the patents on all these poison injections they're bringing out right now.
[00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:53.027]  Let's not forget who's behind this whole thing.
[00:11:54.175 --> 00:12:01.197]  Let's not forget that these shots lower your immunity, where you're going to have them for the rest of your life all the time, and this is a trap, and Bill Maher gets that!
[00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:06.679]  Why would people as a general society, even in the establishment, want to create a hell?
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.480]  That destroys everybody!
[00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:23.587]  But these guys want to follow the corporate directives of psychotic big pharma when Pfizer has more convictions and more giant settlements for knowingly killing people in secret trials around the world in the third world than any other company combined.
[00:12:23.767 --> 00:12:27.728]  They're worse than Bayer, that knowingly gave millions HIV and hepatitis.
[00:12:27.968 --> 00:12:29.268]  You think this is a freaking joke?
[00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:34.630]  You little smart-mouthed punk, reading your corporate lines, trying to gaslight us, you little bastard!
[00:12:36.191 --> 00:12:36.711]  Finish the clip.
[00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:40.406]  That we express trust in our institutions.
[00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.287]  I said I took one for the team.
[00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:43.068]  Right, I'm saying get vaccinated.
[00:12:43.108 --> 00:12:57.716]  Absolutely, but if there's a need for boosters, particularly, absolutely, as the evidence is showing amongst those who have underlying conditions, amongst the elderly, so on and so forth, it's important that they take them and it's important that they trust those who are urging them to do it.
[00:12:57.896 --> 00:13:00.658]  Okay, but you just said underlying conditions and elderly.
[00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:02.058]  I don't count myself either.
[00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.819]  So is my body better?
[00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:04.600]  Don't stop again.
[00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:07.273]  The guy said so on and so forth.
[00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:08.374]  Wow, that's really intellectual.
[00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:11.095]  Notice he also said our way of life is threatened.
[00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:13.196]  Oh, you're holding us hostage.
[00:13:13.717 --> 00:13:15.258]  We're Australia, the government admits.
[00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:21.902]  Oh, we're following the UN recommendations to keep the lockdowns going until you all accept the shots.
[00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:31.108]  So you're holding us hostage, and then saying, oh, those of you that don't take the shots, you're the reason two-year-olds gotta wear a mask when it does nothing.
[00:13:31.508 --> 00:13:34.491]  You people are damn cult leaders, and we see through you.
[00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:36.272]  You need to be in frickin' prison!
[00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:44.858]  You people cooked it up, you released it, and you need to be held, and you need to be charged, and you need to be tried, and you need to have your nuts broken!
[00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:49.582]  After you've been convicted legally in a court of law, go back to them.
[00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.944]  I make, could I have some medical autonomy?
[00:13:53.484 --> 00:14:02.789]  No, look, you absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although they might, but I do think that- Stop it, hit pause.
[00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:03.730]  We gotta go to break.
[00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.091]  I'm gonna come back and just play this whole thing.
[00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:07.192]  Listen to the double thing.
[00:14:07.272 --> 00:14:09.413]  No one's mandating it for you at this time.
[00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:10.053]  Maybe they will.
[00:14:10.394 --> 00:14:11.434]  It's all being pushed.
[00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:12.395]  It's all being bullied.
[00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:14.236]  It all violates the Nuremberg Code.
[00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:21.338]  And they've got these corporate shills just rattling off BS at us when everything they told us is a lie.
[00:14:21.358 --> 00:14:22.901]  In fact, find it during the break if you can.
[00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:24.363]  I played like three times last week.
[00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:29.050]  THE Surgeon General in his little Admiral outfit.
[00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:33.885]  You know, it was weird whenever the head of Scientology did it.
[00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:35.426]  It's just as weird when this guy does it.
[00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:40.809]  He's up there in this admiral outfit and he says, oh, natural immunity doesn't work.
[00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:41.530]  It's no good.
[00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.750]  It doesn't exist.
[00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:46.733]  That's a total lie when it's 20, 30, 40 times better than this crap.
[00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:48.354]  Even if it was good, it's not.
[00:14:48.374 --> 00:14:51.456]  They're just lying to you like fire is not hot.
[00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:53.037]  Fish do not live in the water.
[00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:55.859]  George Washington was not the President of the United States.
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:01.146]  I mean, just lie after lie after lie, beady-eyed scum lying to us.
[00:15:02.327 --> 00:15:08.875]  So they're lying to you in the most bald-faced, insane lies they can everywhere, in every way.
[00:15:10.384 --> 00:15:12.506]  But the people of the world are waking up and resisting.
[00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:13.948]  Next segment, I'll cover it.
[00:15:14.588 --> 00:15:18.352]  All over the planet, in the UK, they're taking over TV stations.
[00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:24.378]  In France, millions are marching, taking over whole cities, taking over shopping malls, just absolutely dominating.
[00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:29.103]  In Australia, they're just breaking free and refusing to submit.
[00:15:29.183 --> 00:15:34.027]  And now, the Prime Minister is saying, OK, now we have to end the lockdowns because of the rebellion.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.643]  As soon as people stop rebelling, they'll bring the lockdowns right back.
[00:15:37.683 --> 00:15:41.808]  But people have to understand that this is the Great Reset.
[00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:43.590]  This is a takeover plan.
[00:15:43.991 --> 00:15:44.451]  Here's another one.
[00:15:44.512 --> 00:15:50.379]  Australia truck drivers vow to block every major highway in radical anti-lockdown strike.
[00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:51.079]  Zero hedge.
[00:15:52.561 --> 00:15:54.203]  We'll be covering that coming up next segment.
[00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:58.531]  Because they're coming for our children, and Australia is the model.
[00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:06.583]  As Tucker Carlson did an excellent job last night covering, and as we've been doing an excellent job covering here, obviously very intensely the last few months.
[00:16:07.284 --> 00:16:10.949]  But right now, let's go back to this Bill Maher with the Democratic Party operative.
[00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:17.212]  He's got on there, and Bill Maher just started saying, do I get any medical autonomy?
[00:16:17.232 --> 00:16:17.972]  Do I have any?
[00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:20.173]  And the guy's like, oh yeah, you have it, maybe.
[00:16:20.293 --> 00:16:21.274]  Well, we can take it away.
[00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:25.015]  I mean, this is just so, on a scale of 1 to 100, it's 110.
[00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:29.016]  I mean, it's just cartoon level, 1984 science fiction dystopia.
[00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.947]  And it doesn't even work!
[00:16:37.707 --> 00:16:45.669]  I mean, if it worked, we would go, okay, they're using a good drug to get a global database to control us to get rid of our rights, and we'll be set up later under their control.
[00:16:45.689 --> 00:16:54.372]  That's like in Childhood's End that was written by Arthur C. Clarke that launched his whole career at the Globalist, you know, uses a template of their actual plan.
[00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:59.694]  The aliens show up and won't really show themselves, but they give us life extension where we stop dying.
[00:17:02.367 --> 00:17:07.892]  And it takes a generation or two until we find out, well, it's because they're actually going to take our bodies and take our, steal our souls.
[00:17:08.753 --> 00:17:10.535]  Oh, and the aliens don't look too friendly either.
[00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:15.239]  So there it worked a hundred percent.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.563]  Like they come and they give you something that works, but they get full control doing it.
[00:17:19.944 --> 00:17:25.209]  This isn't even like having real peanut butter or cheese on the mousetrap.
[00:17:26.263 --> 00:17:32.787]  It's just a mousetrap that you see killing mice, and there's not even a piece of food on the trap!
[00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:35.168]  And you still just run and jump into it.
[00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.210]  It's the murder of common sense.
[00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:42.053]  Again, we're going to scan everything on your phone remotely.
[00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:45.855]  And then they put billboards up everywhere saying, Apple equals privacy.
[00:17:46.515 --> 00:17:47.616]  You're like, that's gaslighting!
[00:17:48.116 --> 00:17:53.840]  It's behavioral psychologists running corporations that are in a revolution against us.
[00:17:54.858 --> 00:18:03.560]  That's why there's sudden Satanism on TV, and pedophilia on TV, and world government on TV, and all these lies, because they're getting ready for a total financial collapse.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:11.203]  And, you know, we really should just talk about that, because this demoralization, these poison shots, that's just getting us ready for the collapse.
[00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:14.483]  And, you know, you tune in here to get tomorrow's news today.
[00:18:17.602 --> 00:18:24.886]  Starting next hour, I'm going to get more into what's coming next in this total collapse, because there's still time to mitigate how bad it's going to be, but not much.
[00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:29.788]  And so I want everybody to know who the authors of their enslavement and destruction is.
[00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:31.689]  So we'll be laying that out as well.
[00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.291]  We have some big special guests I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:36.332]  But first, let's go back to Bill Maher.
[00:18:37.102 --> 00:18:38.523]  So is my body different?
[00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:42.225]  Can I have some medical autonomy?
[00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:55.914]  No, look, you absolutely, no one is mandating it for you in your particular position, although they might, but I do think that it's very dangerous to enter into a conversation here about personal responsibility.
[00:18:56.514 --> 00:18:59.676]  When the truth of the matter is, is that this is a matter of collective responsibility.
[00:19:00.177 --> 00:19:05.961]  If large groups of people do not get vaccinated, they go to the hospital, and our hospitals get overrun.
[00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:10.064]  And then you can't get a mammogram, you can't get a biopsy, and so many other things.
[00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.285]  Literally, society as we know it can't function.
[00:19:12.846 --> 00:19:14.567]  So, this is important.
[00:19:15.127 --> 00:19:17.609]  That people are urged to get vaccinated.
[00:19:17.649 --> 00:19:18.950]  It's important that they do get vaccinated.
[00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:27.025]  That's why I said the team.
[00:19:28.226 --> 00:19:29.567]  Well, we're proud to have you on today.
[00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:32.289]  Because I did it for the team.
[00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.371]  Max?
[00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:36.232]  What's that idiot's name?
[00:19:38.174 --> 00:19:38.574]  Rose.
[00:19:39.535 --> 00:19:40.896]  Where do they dig these people up?
[00:19:40.976 --> 00:19:42.957]  So all that's doublespeak, all that's tyranny.
[00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:45.599]  Former congressman from New York, of course.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.641]  Okay, so let's go ahead.
[00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:59.063]  And of course, Max Rose isn't going to take care of you when your kid gets cancer from the shot or when they cut your uterus out because of it, which is happening, or when you get blood clots and have a stroke.
[00:19:59.423 --> 00:20:00.604]  He won't pay for your nursing home.
[00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:05.347]  You can bet your bottom dollar, Max Rose hasn't taken the shots.
[00:20:05.627 --> 00:20:08.990]  There's also this thing I see on Twitter and Instagram without even looking, just everywhere.
[00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.531]  I bet Alex Jones secretly took the shot.
[00:20:12.032 --> 00:20:13.473]  He just doesn't want you to have it.
[00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:14.774]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:20:15.574 --> 00:20:16.415]  You people are crazy.
[00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:18.916]  I'm talking about the leftists, man.
[00:20:18.956 --> 00:20:21.260]  They are just so authoritarian.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.091]  Here's Brett Favre getting asked about the so-called vaccines, the gene therapies that don't work other than making you sick on CNN.
[00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:33.086]  Another health issue that is facing football and, well, everyone right now is COVID.
[00:20:33.286 --> 00:20:38.527]  The Falcons today became the first NFL team to say that they are 100% vaccinated.
[00:20:38.547 --> 00:20:41.867]  The NFL has a higher vaccination rate than the general population.
[00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:46.768]  They've been doing pretty well, but there are still some high-profile holdouts like Vikings, QB, Kirk Cousins.
[00:20:47.348 --> 00:20:55.490]  Why do you think there is still a struggle among some athletes, especially when people look to them as role models when it comes to the COVID vaccine?
[00:20:58.832 --> 00:21:00.073]  A great deal of uncertainty.
[00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:03.734]  You hear one thing one day, and you hear something that's totally different the next.
[00:21:04.015 --> 00:21:06.856]  So, we're sort of the human trials, if you will.
[00:21:07.336 --> 00:21:10.378]  And, you know, I think some people are frightened by that.
[00:21:10.718 --> 00:21:15.420]  And the conflicting info that we're all getting.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:25.465]  But there isn't really conflicting info that the vaccine is safe, effective, and needed, and is a public health matter.
[00:21:25.505 --> 00:21:26.585]  I mean, would you...
[00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:29.746]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:21:30.046 --> 00:21:32.328]  Safe, effective, and needed.
[00:21:33.389 --> 00:21:33.689]  Safe.
[00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:36.391]  It has more deaths than all other vaccines ever combined, up front.
[00:21:37.052 --> 00:21:38.333]  It doesn't work, they admit.
[00:21:38.993 --> 00:21:39.754]  And it's not needed.
[00:21:40.154 --> 00:21:41.195]  And it's causing variants.
[00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:43.897]  But you just repeat that like parrots, don't you?
[00:21:45.398 --> 00:21:53.345]  To sit up there, nice pretty girl, with your yes men, on CNN, attacking your enemy, the American people.
[00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.607]  When China and India won't take any of these shots,
[00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.379]  The Australians are at 25% and I'm glad they're not stupid.
[00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:06.111]  And they got a big problem because so many people that took the shots are getting sick now with, quote, COVID from the shot.
[00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:12.173]  They're going to get their booster and then get even sicker and create more mutations?
[00:22:12.854 --> 00:22:18.257]  Well, there's national news everywhere, hundreds of news articles saying Alex Jones claims vaccines make you a mutant.
[00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:21.578]  Well, they do actually gene therapy change your genetics.
[00:22:21.598 --> 00:22:25.180]  They do mutate you like frankenfoods or whatever, you know, that Monsanto creates.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.681]  But that's not what I meant by that.
[00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:29.643]  In the full context, I was saying creates mutant strains.
[00:22:31.004 --> 00:22:32.645]  I had a whole stack of articles that day on that.
[00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:37.846]  Will you guys re-pull me the mutant strain vaccines, vaccines causing mutant strains, please?
[00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:38.206]  Thank you.
[00:22:39.707 --> 00:22:41.207]  Let's finish up with the Brett Favre clip.
[00:23:01.334 --> 00:23:05.818]  I think it's not my place to say get the vaccine or don't get the vaccine.
[00:23:05.898 --> 00:23:09.140]  I think that's a matter of choice by all individuals.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.982]  And, you know, that's why we live in America.
[00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:17.547]  You yourself, I mean, you don't want to say, which I respect, but you don't trust the vaccines?
[00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:23.650]  Hey lady, when's the last time you visited your gynecologist?
[00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.872]  Did he stick his fingers in you?
[00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:27.794]  I mean, that's a rude thing to say, isn't it?
[00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:31.938]  Because it's your medical records, lady, and he's got his medical records.
[00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:33.340]  You remember your body, your choice?
[00:23:34.201 --> 00:23:34.581]  Understand?
[00:23:34.601 --> 00:23:36.904]  Stay out of my body, you CNN witch!
[00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:37.764]  Stay with us.
[00:23:38.894 --> 00:23:47.038]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this live August 24, 2021 transmission.
[00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:54.942]  And I guess I should probably tell you about some of the guests that are coming up here today.
[00:23:54.962 --> 00:23:58.144]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, who
[00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:09.626]  Was speaking in his home state and gave a really good speech at his alma mater high school about the tyranny that was taking place.
[00:24:09.646 --> 00:24:12.628]  I think it's one of the best spoken people I've heard yet.
[00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:18.833]  And so he's going to be joining us in the third hour, a little bit into the fourth hour today.
[00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:26.440]  And then political prisoner Owen Schroyer will be joining us.
[00:24:29.795 --> 00:24:40.963]  Coming up in the last 45 minutes of the fourth hour, he was only in jail for about four or five hours in the federal jail yesterday.
[00:24:42.193 --> 00:24:47.436]  And the judge put some restrictions on him not to talk to people involved in January 6th about the case.
[00:24:48.537 --> 00:24:52.079]  But at the same time he is a talk show host and everything he did is on body cam.
[00:24:53.019 --> 00:24:55.441]  So what we did is on record.
[00:24:56.241 --> 00:25:01.324]  And so Owen will be here just in general talking about the news and covering information.
[00:25:01.344 --> 00:25:02.885]  But the left got very upset.
[00:25:03.525 --> 00:25:08.008]  Very, very, very upset to learn that Owen
[00:25:10.743 --> 00:25:11.203]  I don't
[00:25:26.972 --> 00:25:31.254]  I don't even hate these weird people on Twitter and on other platforms.
[00:25:31.574 --> 00:25:38.898]  I just, I feel sorry for them because they are such authoritarians, but they're not even part of the power structure.
[00:25:38.918 --> 00:25:47.423]  They're just there like a mob wanting to exact revenge on those of us that have just simply tried to save the country.
[00:25:48.143 --> 00:25:55.547]  And then they can see who they stole the election for and who they installed, destroying everyone's future, but they can't even seem
[00:25:56.687 --> 00:25:57.828]  To figure that out.
[00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:06.356]  Now, there are so many powerful John Bowne reports that he's been doing lately, and I enjoy talking on the show.
[00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:15.324]  But at the same time, when we get really, really powerful reports and things in, I think it's really important to air those on the broadcast.
[00:26:16.065 --> 00:26:18.507]  And so we're gonna play this report right now.
[00:26:18.527 --> 00:26:22.831]  The media celebrates World War IV plague.
[00:26:25.387 --> 00:26:28.508]  And then we also have the treasonous propaganda holdouts.
[00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:30.689]  These are all really important.
[00:26:31.069 --> 00:26:41.512]  I already played at the start of the show, what I think is one of his best reports in a long time, and really codifies the fraud of these people, and that's the COVID tyranny meets resistance worldwide.
[00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:47.414]  That is such an incredibly important transmission.
[00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:49.274]  And I'm really proud of the listeners.
[00:26:49.314 --> 00:26:55.036]  If we can go to the front page of Band.Video, the little short four-minute clip
[00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:07.998]  of Dr. Sean M. Brooks only had about 80,000 views yesterday, whenever we mentioned it, and I said, that needs to go viral.
[00:27:08.698 --> 00:27:10.179]  And you guys did an incredible job.
[00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:14.742]  It now has 1,051,700 plus views.
[00:27:15.542 --> 00:27:20.205]  And then if everybody you told to share it, if they just shared it, it would have 10 million.
[00:27:20.998 --> 00:27:23.961]  And then if they shared it, it'd have a hundred million and it'd be game over.
[00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:38.094]  Now, yes, the bills that we get because Prison Planet is now unfolding and people know that we have a lot of credibility, so our visitors are exploding.
[00:27:39.155 --> 00:27:42.018]  And so the bills that we get over at Band.Video,
[00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:45.820]  Which again is not the URL to share because they blocked that.
[00:27:46.121 --> 00:27:48.762]  You want to share the URL freeworldnews.tv.
[00:27:48.902 --> 00:27:50.023]  They're not censoring that yet.
[00:27:50.243 --> 00:27:54.025]  It's the exact same site, exact same index, freeworldnews.tv.
[00:27:54.525 --> 00:27:55.806]  The bills we get are just stratospheric.
[00:27:55.886 --> 00:28:01.289]  Millions of dollars a quarter just in bandwidth around this operation and it's getting more insane.
[00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:04.210]  And we're always shopping around, always trying to get better deals.
[00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.971]  We buy a lot of bandwidth.
[00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:08.673]  But you have to understand that we're doing it all.
[00:28:08.713 --> 00:28:10.274]  The satellite uplinks, the encoders,
[00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:12.403]  Everything is us.
[00:28:12.483 --> 00:28:17.546]  And so, when you see an iPhone, that is hundreds of millions of dollars of investment to make that.
[00:28:18.006 --> 00:28:19.527]  When you see a Droid, it's the same thing.
[00:28:19.567 --> 00:28:22.709]  When you see Google, that's trillions over the years.
[00:28:23.209 --> 00:28:25.571]  The last 25 years that have been spent to build that infrastructure.
[00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:26.191]  Trillions.
[00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:27.912]  Same thing with Apple.
[00:28:29.193 --> 00:28:31.575]  And same thing with those other companies, like the big telecoms.
[00:28:32.155 --> 00:28:35.958]  So, when I tell you we need tens of millions of dollars
[00:28:36.854 --> 00:28:45.568]  We're like David versus Goliath, but Goliath is a thousand feet tall and we're about six inches tall, but the truth is so powerful.
[00:28:46.803 --> 00:28:51.226]  That when we're able to fire the truth out, it still has a bigger effect than their trillions of dollars.
[00:28:51.286 --> 00:29:05.958]  But that's what this comes down to, is to do what we're doing and to be on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations and to be just dominating all over the place and to see them so mad on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter saying, how do we still hear of Alex Jones?
[00:29:06.018 --> 00:29:07.039]  Why is he still trending?
[00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.581]  Why is he still getting millions of viewers every day?
[00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:12.083]  And it's all because of you supporting us.
[00:29:12.843 --> 00:29:14.805]  It's all because of you taking action.
[00:29:16.468 --> 00:29:23.012]  It's all because of you and your perseverance and supporting us, so thank you.
[00:29:23.032 --> 00:29:39.402]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with the report and get into all the huge news, but it really is you buying books and films and water filters and air filters and... Let me get my folder over here.
[00:29:40.163 --> 00:29:44.426]  And supporting us that allows this broadcast to stay
[00:29:45.506 --> 00:29:46.426]  To stay on the air.
[00:29:47.567 --> 00:29:54.130]  So it's important to know that we have a new sale going that I would really take advantage of because you are the InfoWarrant, plus these are great products that you need.

[00:30:43.702 --> 00:30:44.022]  Stay with us.
[00:31:14.218 --> 00:31:15.759]  It really is true, we're the tip of the spear.
[00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:22.965]  And I'm going to talk about the path out of this and the solutions at the start of the next hour.
[00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:28.310]  And I'm also going to lay out what the Globals are going to do next if we don't stop them, which really means we don't have a choice.
[00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:31.973]  There's so much coming up, obviously, today.
[00:31:31.993 --> 00:31:34.535]  Another very, very important broadcast.
[00:31:34.555 --> 00:31:35.696]  We're just blessed to be here.
[00:31:37.658 --> 00:31:40.880]  But let me right now, here on the Alex Jones Show, get into this.
[00:31:41.758 --> 00:31:45.661]  If I just wanted to make Joe Biden look bad, we could fill the whole four-hour show every day with it.
[00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:48.123]  He's designed to make America look bad.
[00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:49.504]  He's designed to demoralize.
[00:31:50.105 --> 00:31:55.649]  He's designed to make the country look incompetent and under globalist Qaikom control.
[00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:06.117]  And that's why the Taliban has now come out and said, this is a red line, you will leave by August 31st.
[00:32:07.278 --> 00:32:10.581]  Just a week ago, the leader of the Taliban said you have until September
[00:32:11.947 --> 00:32:11.987]  11th.
[00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:16.391]  But they know that Biden is scared.
[00:32:17.552 --> 00:32:20.114]  And that Biden's basically been ordered to do this by his handlers.
[00:32:21.034 --> 00:32:25.078]  And is now committed because the Taliban has been in control.
[00:32:25.098 --> 00:32:29.801]  The globalists have been in control of the Taliban since the 1970s.
[00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:33.965]  And the CIA has had secret agreements with them the entire time.
[00:32:34.605 --> 00:32:37.607]  The truth is the Taliban was not killed or removed on
[00:32:38.846 --> 00:32:40.486]  September 11th when the U.S.
[00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:43.567]  attacked Kabul on September 12th.
[00:32:44.988 --> 00:32:50.749]  More than 30,000 Taliban were flown out to safety in the airlift of evil by the CIA.
[00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:57.571]  The Taliban ordered basically 14 and 15 year old boys to stay in frontline positions to be bombed and killed by the U.S.
[00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:00.812]  and that whole takeover of Afghanistan was completely staged.
[00:33:02.722 --> 00:33:07.665]  There have been some real tribal groups attacking the troops and some real attacks going on.
[00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:12.867]  And then the Taliban did double back and attack and double cross the CIA, but that's what they do.
[00:33:12.967 --> 00:33:16.889]  So the CIA put the Mullahs in power in Iran in 79.
[00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.351]  They put the Taliban in power in 79.
[00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:25.914]  They put Al Qaeda and ISIS and the Taliban in charge of the invasions all over the Middle East and Africa.
[00:33:25.954 --> 00:33:27.375]  And so it's the same story over and over again.
[00:33:27.915 --> 00:33:31.017]  The CIA is run by what ran British intelligence.
[00:33:31.437 --> 00:33:32.738]  It's not British intelligence now.
[00:33:32.818 --> 00:33:34.861]  It's a global corporate criminal combine.
[00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.622]  And that's all mainline history.
[00:33:36.642 --> 00:33:37.663]  You saw that in Syria.
[00:33:37.703 --> 00:33:38.564]  You saw it in Libya.
[00:33:38.885 --> 00:33:39.785]  You saw it in Egypt.
[00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:41.327]  You saw Fast and Furious.
[00:33:41.828 --> 00:33:47.473]  More than 5 million guns shipped out of the US to Mexico to be shipped for the Arab Spring by Obama.
[00:33:48.054 --> 00:33:48.394]  And now...
[00:33:49.417 --> 00:34:00.046]  The same law firms suing me and suing others are trying to sue the gun industry out of business, saying it's their fault that guns got into Mexico and went overseas.
[00:34:00.467 --> 00:34:03.770]  And Mexico is now suing 20-plus gun manufacturers.
[00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.214]  They'll never sue Obama, who actually ran the whole thing.
[00:34:08.454 --> 00:34:16.401]  Though it did make Eric Holder, then head of the Justice Department, step down when it turned out he was giving the orders directing it.
[00:34:18.962 --> 00:34:25.343]  So this is just all part of the globalists using their secret proxy army.
[00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:31.745]  But now Biden suggests Kamala Harris will be president pretty soon.
[00:34:31.805 --> 00:34:32.445]  He just said this.
[00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:32.885]  Here it is.
[00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:39.047]  My two daughters were born that you can do anything a man can do.
[00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:44.228]  It's one thing for somebody to say that and keep pounding that in the head of their five granddaughters as well.
[00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:45.388]  But guess what?
[00:34:46.351 --> 00:34:50.353]  Until they see it, until they watch, it becomes real then.
[00:34:51.093 --> 00:35:01.917]  That's why, by the way, she happens to be in Asia for me right now, but that's why we have a female vice president of the United States of America who's going to be, we're going to have some presidents pretty soon.
[00:35:01.937 --> 00:35:04.418]  Yep, there you go.
[00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:06.359]  It's all been pre-planned, all been prepared.
[00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:09.890]  He's senile, he's blackmailed, he's a Chinese agent.
[00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:15.312]  They got the child porn of him and kids, child porn of him and his son having sex with their own kids, their own family.
[00:35:15.872 --> 00:35:16.492]  It's all on there.
[00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:20.553]  He has sex with all his children.
[00:35:21.794 --> 00:35:22.774]  They all have sex with each other.
[00:35:24.595 --> 00:35:27.216]  His wife wears what a 20-year-old prostitute would wear on TV.
[00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:29.136]  I mean, these people are scum.
[00:35:30.057 --> 00:35:36.739]  You talk about something out of a nightmare, out of a Rob Zombie movie, they are the real deal.
[00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:40.375]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:35:40.475 --> 00:35:47.397]  Negotiating with terrorists, Biden's CIA director, former head of the Carnegie Endowment, fails to secure deadline extension from Taliban.
[00:35:48.877 --> 00:35:49.498]  It's all staged.
[00:35:52.658 --> 00:35:53.479]  Biden told U.S.
[00:35:53.499 --> 00:36:01.061]  commanders not to send out troops to rescue Americans trapped in Kabul because he feared a black lockdown moment.
[00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.701]  It would make him look bad.
[00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:09.484]  American mom stranded in Afghanistan tearfully begs Joe Biden to send help.
[00:36:09.984 --> 00:36:12.146]  I don't know if I'm ever going to see my children again.
[00:36:12.166 --> 00:36:14.568]  The Biden effect.
[00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:19.811]  France, UK, Italy, and Germany turned to Putin and Russia for assistance in Afghanistan.
[00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:30.539]  Thanks to the Joe Biden, the Taliban now has over 200 military aircraft, ranks them as the 26th in the list of nations in combat aircraft strength.
[00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:34.122]  You think they couldn't fly aircraft out?
[00:36:35.256 --> 00:36:39.978]  Psaki falsely claims Americans not stranded in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
[00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:42.238]  She'll probably claim the vaccine works next, too.
[00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:49.121]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:49.521]  U.S.
[00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:53.282]  collected biometric equipment and data has fallen into the hands of the Taliban.
[00:36:53.703 --> 00:36:54.683]  It's now confirmed.
[00:36:54.823 --> 00:36:55.823]  We weren't sure last week.
[00:36:59.505 --> 00:37:01.345]  But now, supposedly, Biden will order U.S.
[00:37:01.365 --> 00:37:03.346]  troops to rescue Americans stranded in Kabul.
[00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.180]  Kamala Harris, though, was over in Singapore and she wouldn't answer questions.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.485]  She says the time for analyzing is later.
[00:37:12.505 --> 00:37:13.106]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:13.126 --> 00:37:13.728]  You've forgotten.
[00:37:14.645 --> 00:37:14.905]  About it.
[00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:19.346]  Meanwhile, neocons and left-wingers are pushing, bring all the Afghans here.
[00:37:19.446 --> 00:37:19.786]  Yes.
[00:37:20.646 --> 00:37:22.867]  Yes, we need more people like Ilhan Omar.
[00:37:23.227 --> 00:37:23.607]  The U.S.
[00:37:23.627 --> 00:37:29.189]  should take as many African, excuse me, Afghan refugees as it can.
[00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:32.109]  Think of Ilhan Omar from Somalia.
[00:37:32.629 --> 00:37:35.990]  Saved his little girl and she even attacked the troops that saved her.
[00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.031]  She has no level of decency.
[00:37:40.356 --> 00:37:41.697]  And then here's one from Forbes.
[00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:44.178]  Oh, that got mixed in with my Joe Biden stack.
[00:37:44.998 --> 00:37:45.699]  I'd lost this.
[00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:53.342]  Oh, look, Pfizer shot just 39% effective against COVID now.
[00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:55.423]  Oh my gosh, 39%.
[00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:58.025]  But you heard it worked so well.
[00:37:58.685 --> 00:37:59.706]  Next hour, I've got the
[00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:05.805]  Surgeon General saying, oh, natural immunity's not good.
[00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:06.445]  Oh, no, no.
[00:38:06.525 --> 00:38:08.246]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:10.186]  They're saying, mother's milk's not good.
[00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:11.467]  No, no, formula's what you want.
[00:38:12.407 --> 00:38:15.508]  But, but, but, natural immunity's so much better than these shots.
[00:38:15.588 --> 00:38:17.409]  It's saying, you don't want mother's milk.
[00:38:17.449 --> 00:38:19.209]  You want to give the baby cyanide.
[00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:21.310]  Or Drano.
[00:38:22.386 --> 00:38:23.807]  Don't give that baby that!
[00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:25.767]  Babies never drink mother's milk.
[00:38:26.007 --> 00:38:34.511]  You know, I used to joke, and I said, there'll come a time when they claim it's a conspiracy theory that mothers ever breastfed, because they're trying to phase that out, because it makes people not as smart, not as healthy.
[00:38:35.511 --> 00:38:37.872]  Pretty, you know, your natural vaccines is the colostrum.
[00:38:38.892 --> 00:38:40.353]  And now we're pretty much to that point.
[00:38:40.593 --> 00:38:41.973]  Most births are cesarean.
[00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:43.874]  Most people don't breastfeed.
[00:38:44.454 --> 00:38:45.175]  And you can see it.
[00:38:45.215 --> 00:38:45.855]  I mean, it's sad.
[00:38:45.915 --> 00:38:46.735]  People are dull.
[00:38:46.775 --> 00:38:47.476]  They're dumbed down.
[00:38:48.516 --> 00:38:50.157]  They don't have a life force.
[00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:50.857]  They're asleep.
[00:38:52.162 --> 00:39:03.324]  And that's the thing I found pretty much with anybody, if you can get through to them and get them to make connections to God and the universe and their ancestors, that they can activate and get through the fog and come out of the trance.
[00:39:03.344 --> 00:39:13.186]  And I think more and more, instead of just covering all the news and all the information, we should talk about the spirituality and God and how to get out of the trance and ways to break the conditioning.
[00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:21.307]  And just whether you're old or young or black or white or male or female or where you live, the real thing is,
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:25.542]  It's a growing process, and I'm not perfect either.
[00:39:25.562 --> 00:39:32.113]  And it's fun to bash liberals, and it's fun to get mad at them, and it's fun to talk about how stupid they are, but that's a reflection on us that we've let that happen.
[00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:41.248]  I love all these people, other than conscious demons like Fauci and Bill Gates and people at the very top.
[00:39:41.288 --> 00:39:43.248]  But most of these people are scared.
[00:39:43.268 --> 00:39:44.749]  They're just trying to belong to something.
[00:39:45.229 --> 00:39:46.769]  They're trying to go along with the system.
[00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:50.890]  And they're finding out they're losing all their medical autonomy, all their future, all their freedom.
[00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.871]  And they know deep down that it's a fraud, so they're scared.
[00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:56.532]  And we've got to reach out to them in a loving, nice way.
[00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:58.022]  You think so?
[00:40:16.795 --> 00:40:18.857]  Love is the answer, but also action.
[00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:25.883]  You got to love people, but you got to then put the action into it of saying no to the system and then standing in the way of the globalists.
[00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:29.927]  So we're going to go to break and come back with a really powerful John Bowne report.
[00:40:29.947 --> 00:40:34.251]  And then I'm going to get into what the world's going to look like if we don't turn this around.
[00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:39.591]  We don't stop this and why these globalists are doing it.
[00:40:39.631 --> 00:40:59.469]  You know so many times I'm in the morning and I just see the whole future and see all the thousands of data points, millions of data points together and I see the angles of how to stop it and how to overcome it and I have this huge mental picture and then I've got to go on air and explain this to people and then I'll be on air and capture a lot of that same essence but then
[00:41:00.532 --> 00:41:04.055]  It's hard to telegraph it forward, but there's been many magic moments on here.
[00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:17.004]  Sometimes three, four minute stream of consciousness where it's just so powerful and you know it's coming from somewhere beyond me and that's what I'm seeking to try to bring you because that's always in my mind.
[00:41:17.404 --> 00:41:21.547]  I know every angle of the enemy, up, down, side, the other, but trying to articulate it.
[00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:22.488]  I know you do as well.
[00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:29.232]  The question for all of us is how to articulate the spirit and the discernment we have to the third dimension to save the people and save ourselves.
[00:41:29.693 --> 00:41:30.533]  We'll be right back.
[00:41:30.573 --> 00:41:31.134]  Stay with us.
[00:41:31.474 --> 00:41:32.254]  Pray for justice.
[00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:33.115]  Pray for peace.
[00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:33.816]  Pray for love.
[00:41:35.137 --> 00:41:35.417]  All right.
[00:41:35.517 --> 00:41:39.480]  John Bowne is always knocking them out of the park, just like our great Gregg Reese and all our other contributors.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.541]  But he's done three reports the last day.
[00:41:41.561 --> 00:41:43.523]  They're in the John Bowne section of Banned.Video.
[00:41:43.563 --> 00:41:44.063]  Here's one of them.
[00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:46.024]  Media celebrates World War IV.
[00:41:46.084 --> 00:41:46.445]  Here it is.
[00:41:49.088 --> 00:42:02.832]  Vaccine mandates have been what we as Americans have done for the past 50, 60 years to eradicate smallpox, to try to get rid of polio, rubella.
[00:42:03.192 --> 00:42:04.293]  It's just not new.
[00:42:04.413 --> 00:42:05.813]  And you're acting so shocked.
[00:42:05.893 --> 00:42:09.774]  And some of you send me emails going, my liberties are being taken.
[00:42:09.834 --> 00:42:10.375]  No, they're not.
[00:42:10.635 --> 00:42:17.857]  No, no more than your liberties were being taken away when your parents were told that you couldn't get a public education.
[00:42:18.117 --> 00:42:20.740]  The EU didn't have six vaccine passports!
[00:42:21.221 --> 00:42:32.216]  But these conspiracy theories are not only making people stupid, they're making them sick, and they're causing them to die, and they're acting like this is something new, and that's the most maddening thing.
[00:42:32.336 --> 00:42:35.480]  Oh, you said COVID wasn't real, huh?
[00:42:36.505 --> 00:42:46.251]  Oh no, it was a real virus they made in the lab, where the vaccine response then causes massive mutations and all these new variants, which I predicted with top scientists on my show.
[00:42:46.392 --> 00:42:49.253]  I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:42:49.874 --> 00:42:53.356]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:42:55.498 --> 00:42:58.319]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.722]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:43:04.338 --> 00:43:16.602]  But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:43:16.642 --> 00:43:23.885]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:31.987]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:43:32.447 --> 00:43:35.708]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:38.968]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:43:40.049 --> 00:43:49.491]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast.
[00:43:50.347 --> 00:43:52.028]  That you could never read them all.
[00:43:52.308 --> 00:43:59.932]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[00:43:59.972 --> 00:44:01.092]  Who's behind all this?
[00:44:01.532 --> 00:44:02.413]  The Bilderberg Group.
[00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:07.295]  They want a planetary dictatorship so they can carry out their foresty population agenda.
[00:44:07.515 --> 00:44:09.336]  And they want to do it through the medical system.
[00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:11.797]  And that's why vaccines are so important.
[00:44:11.857 --> 00:44:15.679]  And I've got an insider I think you should really talk to, Dr. Rima Labo.
[00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:18.701]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, Ph.D., Oxford.
[00:44:40.034 --> 00:44:49.163]  Dr. Robert Malone who created the messenger RNA vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[00:44:49.523 --> 00:44:52.225]  He created it and he says don't ever do it.
[00:44:52.426 --> 00:44:58.191]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five years for three reasons.
[00:44:58.611 --> 00:44:59.092]  Number one,
[00:44:59.755 --> 00:45:03.358]  You've dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[00:45:03.478 --> 00:45:07.080]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.222]  The second did it by 35 now.
[00:45:09.802 --> 00:45:11.944]  If you take any booster shot, you will die.
[00:45:12.664 --> 00:45:13.084]  That's it.
[00:45:13.905 --> 00:45:16.307]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:18.682]  The second reason.
[00:45:19.102 --> 00:45:20.703]  Antibody-dependent enhancement.
[00:45:21.464 --> 00:45:26.048]  Antibody-dependent enhancement is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:28.189]  Unless, of course, you've taken a placebo.
[00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.991]  But there's no way that you would know that.
[00:45:30.731 --> 00:45:38.698]  So given that fact, antibody-dependent enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[00:45:39.338 --> 00:45:43.802]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:47.982]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that.
[00:45:48.282 --> 00:45:49.862]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[00:45:50.303 --> 00:45:52.083]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[00:45:53.203 --> 00:45:55.724]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[00:45:55.864 --> 00:45:58.345]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[00:45:58.825 --> 00:46:00.586]  Take what's called a D-dimer test.
[00:46:01.506 --> 00:46:06.328]  What that does is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[00:46:07.128 --> 00:46:09.689]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[00:46:09.909 --> 00:46:12.870]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:13.690]  Perfect plan.
[00:46:15.134 --> 00:46:21.698]  To create an injection that supposedly counters the virus, but then makes your body produce new variants of it in mass.
[00:46:22.399 --> 00:46:26.121]  And by this winter, there's just going to be millions of dead, probably.
[00:46:29.524 --> 00:46:35.367]  And we are now into hour number two on this August 24th, Tuesday transmission.
[00:46:36.348 --> 00:46:40.551]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very, very blessed and honored to be here with you.
[00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:47.827]  Okay, let's tell you what's coming up this hour.
[00:46:47.907 --> 00:47:00.251]  We've got a lot of economic news, a lot of military news, a lot of medical news, a lot of police state news on the whole Homeland Security move to declare conservatives and Christians as the main terror threat.
[00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:13.255]  But I want to talk about the big lie of the vaccine mandates and that these are supposedly vaccines and where all this is going if we don't stop it.
[00:47:15.117 --> 00:47:30.585]  And if we don't turn this around because we're now sure we're not just reading globalist documents like lockstep and crimson contagion and spars and event 201 and then saying oh they're saying they're gonna do this and then
[00:47:31.823 --> 00:47:38.287]  Coming with hypotheses of how it would roll out, which you've been dead on, we're now almost two years into the takeover.
[00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:42.469]  And it's going exactly as our worst analysis said it would.
[00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:51.155]  And so that means that you better brace yourself and get ready for what is about to be unfolding and happening.
[00:47:51.215 --> 00:47:57.859]  And the big question is, how is the system going to spin
[00:47:59.264 --> 00:48:04.625]  The massive numbers of people dying of blood clots and autoimmune disorders and organ failure.
[00:48:05.786 --> 00:48:06.806]  How are they going to spend that?
[00:48:06.846 --> 00:48:07.606]  And it's quite easy.
[00:48:07.626 --> 00:48:12.027]  They're going to say that new variants of COVID-19 have done it.
[00:48:15.408 --> 00:48:17.609]  And so they've been planning this for a very long time.
[00:48:17.669 --> 00:48:19.850]  And they can say, oh, we've always had vaccine mandates.
[00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:28.052]  Yes, they've always, since the 30s with eugenics mandates, injected poor people with all sorts of experimental shots that
[00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:29.219]  Great to see
[00:48:47.219 --> 00:48:53.761]  A report that he just put out today dealing with the huge global awakening that's happening.
[00:48:54.381 --> 00:48:59.043]  He's got a bunch of clips of crimes that Pfizer's committed.
[00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:06.866]  And did you know the lady they put at the head of the FDA to get all this emergency approval and now official approval?
[00:49:07.426 --> 00:49:14.128]  Do you know that she's the lady that was in the agency before who approved OxyContin?
[00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:19.202]  Which they prove was a plan to get millions addicted and kill millions.
[00:49:19.702 --> 00:49:22.342]  It was even in the plan of the drug company to addict people.
[00:49:22.842 --> 00:49:24.003]  That's all on record.
[00:49:24.403 --> 00:49:35.425]  What could be worse than purposely authorizing, because she was given campaign money, and the political parties she was involved in were Democrats mainly, but Republicans were involved as well.
[00:49:35.465 --> 00:49:36.625]  Frank Luntz was the lobbyist.
[00:49:38.426 --> 00:49:39.246]  What could be worse?
[00:49:39.366 --> 00:49:39.986]  Could she
[00:49:41.752 --> 00:49:45.854]  The woman at the FDA who just approved all this, to go after our children and all of it.
[00:49:47.014 --> 00:49:48.274]  Could she do something worse?
[00:49:48.294 --> 00:49:52.576]  And the answer is... Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:52.596 --> 00:49:54.857]  And it's all in John Bowne's report.
[00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:56.978]  She did something even worse.
[00:49:57.838 --> 00:50:10.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, 20-something years ago, MIT developed a drug, 50 to 100 times, depending on the design of it, depending on the type,
[00:50:12.034 --> 00:50:12.935]  Stronger than heroin.
[00:50:14.395 --> 00:50:15.736]  Oxycontin is as strong as heroin.
[00:50:20.038 --> 00:50:30.083]  The woman that headed up the program at the FDA to authorize these frankenshots, and now this authorization, is the one that legalized the production of fentanyl.
[00:50:33.705 --> 00:50:34.306]  Fentanyl.
[00:50:35.906 --> 00:50:36.747]  You think about that.
[00:50:37.287 --> 00:50:38.268]  So are these some killers?
[00:50:39.408 --> 00:50:40.709]  You talking about some murderers here?
[00:50:42.694 --> 00:50:43.795]  Oh yeah, are they coming for us?
[00:50:43.815 --> 00:50:45.216]  You better bet they are.
[00:50:45.696 --> 00:50:46.417]  Oxycontin.
[00:50:47.418 --> 00:50:47.898]  Fentanyl.
[00:50:48.919 --> 00:50:51.440]  Gene therapy injections that change your cells.
[00:50:51.941 --> 00:51:01.548]  Look, this Remdesivir that we've been seeing getting pushed by Fauci and people has less than 8% efficacy and it costs a bunch of money.
[00:51:01.588 --> 00:51:03.069]  They made money off that, didn't help people.
[00:51:03.609 --> 00:51:04.790]  But notice what they're not been promoting.
[00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.451]  Regeneron.
[00:51:07.642 --> 00:51:21.746]  Regeneron creates a bunch of clone white blood cells from mice, trains them to only kill COVID, puts them in you, they're all screens, which is not like from prisoners or something, they're blood, and it goes in with basically no side effects, cleans everything out.
[00:51:21.806 --> 00:51:25.447]  Now there might be stuff we don't know about long-term, no short-term stuff really.
[00:51:26.868 --> 00:51:33.810]  Because it doesn't change your body, it sends something in that goes through and cleans it out, and then you urinate it and defecate it out.
[00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.431]  You pass it through your body, through your gallbladder.
[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:45.054]  But that company has liability.
[00:51:45.575 --> 00:51:46.655]  They've been around since the 80s.
[00:51:46.675 --> 00:51:48.077]  They've got a bunch of stuff that's been proven to work.
[00:51:48.317 --> 00:51:54.622]  They have patented antibodies that are 100% cure one form of skin cancer.
[00:51:54.862 --> 00:51:55.943]  And I wish them all the luck.
[00:51:56.043 --> 00:51:57.224]  I'm Mr. Buck Rogers.
[00:51:57.804 --> 00:51:59.245]  I'm Mr. George Jetson, baby.
[00:51:59.285 --> 00:52:00.086]  I love technology.
[00:52:00.406 --> 00:52:05.210]  If it's vetted, if it doesn't have liability protection, and if it's transparent,
[00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:16.594]  And I'm glad that the governor of Texas has authorized, for people that need it, free Regeneron.
[00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:20.818]  And the company's passed it on for no profit and is doing that.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.101]  So see, I'm all about real stuff.
[00:52:27.123 --> 00:52:29.005]  And are you rolling the dice if you take Regeneron?
[00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:29.645]  You might be.
[00:52:32.047 --> 00:52:33.529]  But does it go in and change your cells?
[00:52:33.649 --> 00:52:33.849]  Nope.
[00:52:34.329 --> 00:52:35.250]  Doesn't do anything to your cells.
[00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:36.571]  Doesn't tell your cells what to do.
[00:52:36.931 --> 00:52:37.972]  Doesn't take control of your cells.
[00:52:38.393 --> 00:52:38.993]  It sins.
[00:52:39.333 --> 00:52:39.714]  Cloned.
[00:52:41.778 --> 00:52:48.182]  Mice, white blood cells, who've been brought up in vats with COVID-19.
[00:52:51.424 --> 00:52:52.204]  And they know how to eat it.
[00:52:52.284 --> 00:52:52.905]  That's all they eat.
[00:52:53.725 --> 00:52:54.446]  They kill one thing.
[00:52:55.866 --> 00:53:00.469]  And I know now four people that have taken it in Austin, who couldn't breathe, were about to die.
[00:53:01.029 --> 00:53:03.871]  And it was just within four or five hours, they were just completely fine.
[00:53:04.331 --> 00:53:07.533]  Just like Trump said, it was like they took it, it was like within four or five hours.
[00:53:07.553 --> 00:53:10.275]  A couple of them got a really bad headache, but that was it.
[00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:13.058]  I mean, it's gone like in a day.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:28.104]  And I would imagine having a bunch of white blood cells crawling through your brain, probably, that aren't yours, probably doesn't feel too good, but we are at the Buck Rogers moment, and see, the globalists don't want us to have all the clean, or cleaner, transparent technology.
[00:53:28.444 --> 00:53:43.329]  They want, out of Big Pharma and out of DARPA that set up Moderna and all this, no liability, total secrecy, no animal testing, no human testing, because they already secretly did it, to roll out something that isn't designed to help you, like Regeneron,
[00:53:45.276 --> 00:53:54.060]  It's designed to hurt you, and that's what all the scientists who looked at it, they said, this will protect you, this will lower your immune system, this will create mutant viruses.
[00:53:56.141 --> 00:54:08.607]  And then it all comes out that the new Delta strain and all this is from the vaccinated, and they had headlines all over the country and MSNBC and CNN and everything else going, look at what a dumbass Alex Jones is.
[00:54:10.902 --> 00:54:15.526]  Why, ha ha, he says the vaccine makes you become a mutant.
[00:54:16.066 --> 00:54:18.569]  He also said the frogs are gay from Atrazine.
[00:54:19.129 --> 00:54:21.431]  No, I didn't say you become a mutant, though technically you do.
[00:54:22.232 --> 00:54:24.874]  Just not in the science fiction version where you have like three heads or whatever.
[00:54:25.975 --> 00:54:26.876]  That'll just be your children.
[00:54:28.457 --> 00:54:29.258]  Literally, in the studies.
[00:54:29.698 --> 00:54:30.119]  In rats.
[00:54:30.459 --> 00:54:33.682]  Massive deformities in their offspring, if they're even able to have them.
[00:54:34.949 --> 00:54:36.951]  No, it's mutants in the cells.
[00:54:37.572 --> 00:54:40.175]  Mutants in the sloughing, the shedding.
[00:54:40.415 --> 00:54:41.356]  This is the reality.
[00:54:44.199 --> 00:54:52.988]  So, we've put together a little compilation we'll cover when we come back with the Surgeon General saying natural immunity is no good.
[00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:56.446]  So I'm saying again, mother's milk's no good, cyanide's good for babies.
[00:54:57.366 --> 00:55:00.687]  And, but then he, in the next cut, oh, the vaccines don't work anymore.
[00:55:01.087 --> 00:55:05.669]  This is day-to-day, oh, it's the best thing ever, gold standard, you'll never need anything, but it doesn't work.
[00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:06.969]  You need more shots.
[00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:09.730]  And then Fauci saying the same thing.
[00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:13.191]  I mean, they act like we're morons, and here's the deal.
[00:55:13.551 --> 00:55:15.412]  The average person's not really a moron.
[00:55:16.512 --> 00:55:19.493]  They're experts on their favorite TV show, their favorite video game.
[00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:24.324]  Or how to go to work, get their job done, and go home and sit in front of the TV.
[00:55:24.644 --> 00:55:27.145]  And I used to be like that for a little while, I guess, in high school.
[00:55:27.165 --> 00:55:28.786]  A little bit in college, not much.
[00:55:28.906 --> 00:55:31.908]  I mean, it's just, it's a dead feeling, but people do it.
[00:55:32.508 --> 00:55:38.751]  And as soon as you get into the real world, and as soon as you figure out how stuff works, it's not work to read documents.
[00:55:38.811 --> 00:55:40.212]  It's not work to research stuff.
[00:55:40.232 --> 00:55:42.873]  Man, the more you learn, the more you want to know.
[00:55:44.454 --> 00:55:45.915]  And it just becomes totally addicting.
[00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:48.792]  And then you're 10 steps ahead of the globalists.
[00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:52.593]  I mean, if I wanted to, if people like me that were awake wanted to take over, we could.
[00:55:53.173 --> 00:55:54.413]  My job is not to take over.
[00:55:55.033 --> 00:55:57.834]  The globalists always say, if you're resisting tyranny, you just want to be the elite.
[00:55:57.894 --> 00:55:58.354]  No, no, no, no.
[00:55:58.675 --> 00:55:59.735]  I don't want to replace the elite.
[00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:01.956]  I want to get rid of them and change the world for the better.
[00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:05.537]  I want a revolution of human empowerment, and I'm here to do it with you.
[00:56:05.837 --> 00:56:06.217]  Stay with us.
[00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:06.757]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:08.177 --> 00:56:11.198]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:56:11.238 --> 00:56:16.500]  to 3 p.m., the vaunted, the hated, the battle-hardened InfoWars.
[00:56:18.231 --> 00:56:20.216]  Live flagship transmission.
[00:56:20.236 --> 00:56:22.401]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.582]  And I am just so thankful to this crew.
[00:56:27.602 --> 00:56:29.083]  I love this crew.
[00:56:29.103 --> 00:56:30.985]  And I'm so thankful to all of you out there.
[00:56:31.065 --> 00:56:31.745]  I love you.
[00:56:31.765 --> 00:56:33.727]  And we are all in this together.
[00:56:33.827 --> 00:56:34.188]  Okay.
[00:56:34.728 --> 00:56:39.733]  Next segment, I'm going to get into the Globalist's big plan and where they will be taking us if we don't resist and fight back.
[00:56:39.793 --> 00:56:44.337]  But the examples of fighting back all over the world that are turning the tide right now.
[00:56:45.017 --> 00:56:46.879]  So this is just an amazing time to be alive.
[00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:48.280]  This is the main enemy attack.
[00:56:48.721 --> 00:56:51.103]  It's their main move and it's a good thing it's now out in the open.
[00:56:52.546 --> 00:56:56.188]  So, we know what happens to tyrants every time they try this.
[00:56:56.248 --> 00:57:04.112]  It may take 10 years, it may take 50 years, it may take six months, but we're going to beat them and wake up and have a new renaissance.
[00:57:05.553 --> 00:57:07.133]  Okay, so let's talk about criminal fraud.
[00:57:07.994 --> 00:57:08.934]  Let's talk about lies.
[00:57:09.735 --> 00:57:13.176]  The PCR test was the basis of all the false positives, 94% at least.
[00:57:15.609 --> 00:57:15.889]  Let's go.
[00:57:36.448 --> 00:57:37.769]  They lied about the Wuhan lab.
[00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.049]  They lied about treatments.
[00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:39.870]  They blocked treatments.
[00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:44.553]  They sent sick people to nursing homes because the virus wasn't spreading very good.
[00:57:45.253 --> 00:57:49.495]  It was a deadly virus if you were actually able to get it and didn't have enough vitamins or minerals.
[00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:53.698]  So now, I believe they actually separately released some other spike protein stuff.
[00:57:53.738 --> 00:58:02.803]  I agree with Mike Adams, but we also have the studies and real scientists looking at it, that after the inoculations began in England first, you suddenly see giant variants popping up.
[00:58:03.143 --> 00:58:04.044]  And the same thing here.
[00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:09.914]  Where that's what happens with viruses is they become more infectious but less lethal.
[00:58:10.515 --> 00:58:16.179]  And so the viral load of the Delta variant is a thousand times worse they're saying than that.
[00:58:16.219 --> 00:58:19.942]  And that's what I see is massive communicability just spreading everywhere.
[00:58:21.328 --> 00:58:37.117]  And the system hopping mad that folks are learning about ivermectin and learning about Regeneron and learning about all the other things that are out there like hydroxychloroquine, thanks to all the great people like Dr. Zelenko and others that have been exposing it.
[00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:42.840]  So income criminal, big pharma operatives that want to be part of the revolving door in government.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.223]  This is Vivek Murthy, the puppet, born in 1977.
[00:58:50.632 --> 00:58:53.633]  Head of the so-called U.S.
[00:58:53.693 --> 00:59:11.037]  Medical Corps saying that your natural immunity is not as good as inoculation immunity from this gene therapy, which lowers your immunity and supposedly just tricks your body to produce spike proteins so it recognizes it and blocks it, but instead it just infects your whole body.
[00:59:12.247 --> 00:59:13.067]  That's all the evidence.
[00:59:13.127 --> 00:59:23.470]  So here he is saying this is better immunity, whereas a normal inoculation will give you some immunity, but they admit maybe 10% of what natural is, depending on what it is.
[00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.311]  I mean, natural can last your whole life.
[00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:33.013]  They found people that were 90 years old who'd gotten infected with the Spanish flu when they were 10 years old, and they still had total immunity to it.
[00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:37.794]  Okay, so saying this is, again, like saying
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:44.501]  The football team in Dallas is not the Dallas Cowboys, it's the Dallas Horndogs.
[00:59:44.921 --> 00:59:45.742]  It's just not true.
[00:59:46.302 --> 00:59:47.122]  But they say it.
[00:59:47.182 --> 00:59:49.383]  He's like, yeah, it's the Dallas Horndogs.
[00:59:49.403 --> 00:59:50.303]  They're like, no, it's the Cowboys.
[00:59:50.343 --> 00:59:50.703]  No, it's not.
[00:59:53.084 --> 00:59:54.684]  Or Superman wears a green cape.
[00:59:54.904 --> 00:59:55.324]  No, he doesn't.
[00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:58.425]  Or George Washington wasn't our first president.
[00:59:58.445 --> 01:00:05.187]  I mean, the lie level, and that's what all the medical doctors say, and the epidemiology and virology and immunity.
[01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:06.307]  I mean, this is a fact.
[01:00:06.407 --> 01:00:06.848]  It's insane.
[01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:10.151]  It's insane.
[01:00:11.872 --> 01:00:13.133]  But that's what these criminals do.
[01:00:13.153 --> 01:00:17.616]  Remember they tried a few months ago, oh, 99% in the hospital didn't take the vaccine.
[01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:23.279]  Turned out it was actually worldwide, 85% in the hospital that had the vaccine that were sick from COVID.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.061]  So everything is upside down world.
[01:00:27.142 --> 01:00:29.523]  And then he quote, is countering misinformation.
[01:00:30.003 --> 01:00:33.325]  So here he is saying, oh, your natural immunity is not good.
[01:00:33.345 --> 01:00:35.146]  Then saying, oh, but the vaccine doesn't work.
[01:00:35.307 --> 01:00:35.727]  Oh, really?
[01:00:38.066 --> 01:00:39.546]  And then I've got the articles right here.
[01:00:39.586 --> 01:00:42.907]  Pfizer shot just 39% effective now.
[01:00:43.547 --> 01:00:44.228]  That's Forbes.
[01:00:45.768 --> 01:00:46.468]  Here's Bloomberg.
[01:00:46.748 --> 01:00:50.869]  Vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illnesses from COVID Delta variant.
[01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:53.890]  Previously thought, oh, Bloomberg, now you need the booster.
[01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:55.050]  See how it works?
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.831]  Because they got their new product for you.
[01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:01.954]  They're murdering logic because logic stands in their way.
[01:01:02.194 --> 01:01:03.315]  They're doing it on purpose.
[01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:04.295]  They're gaslighting you.
[01:01:04.875 --> 01:01:07.257]  So this guy's really a slimy little bastard.
[01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:07.977]  Here he is.
[01:01:09.077 --> 01:01:22.143]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from natural infection, it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine, especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[01:01:22.904 --> 01:01:29.469]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now.
[01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:36.414]  Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time.
[01:01:37.435 --> 01:01:43.319]  This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant.
[01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.400]  That's impossible!
[01:01:45.987 --> 01:01:47.128]  Start the whole thing over in a moment.
[01:01:47.688 --> 01:01:50.070]  So he's saying your normal immunity is not as good.
[01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:51.371]  Oh, but the vaccine doesn't work.
[01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:53.572]  He's wearing literally an admiral clown suit.
[01:01:55.093 --> 01:01:57.815]  Think about the level of the line.
[01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:00.737]  And he says, now is the time to have the injection.
[01:02:01.158 --> 01:02:12.646]  And notice he sounds just like Justin Trudeau, because they go to this NLP training to have a certain cadence and a certain way they talk like a robot, just like NPR does.
[01:02:14.247 --> 01:02:15.027]  Let's go ahead and go to him.
[01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:15.348]  Here it is.
[01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:29.298]  We are seeing more and more data that tells us that while you get some protection from natural infection, it's not nearly as strong as what you get from the vaccine, especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:36.600]  It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:43.522]  Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time.
[01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:50.416]  This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant.
[01:02:51.497 --> 01:03:02.247]  And Dr. Botticieri, at the same time, natural immunity has essentially been kind of tossed aside by Dr. Fauci.
[01:03:03.027 --> 01:03:05.229]  And he's spoken about this directly.
[01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.590]  Watch.
[01:03:07.452 --> 01:03:12.595]  Vaccination in people previously infected significantly boosts the immune response.
[01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:18.378]  Vaccines actually, at least with regard to SARS-CoV-2, can do better than nature.
[01:03:19.733 --> 01:03:21.534]  But take a look at the data out of Israel.
[01:03:21.915 --> 01:03:27.939]  Those who recovered from COVID-19 may be better protected from reinfection than those who received the vaccine.
[01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:39.368]  Since May 1st, 72 people who previously had COVID were infected again, accounting for 1% of confirmed new cases, while 3,000 who were vaccinated have been infected.
[01:03:39.388 --> 01:03:42.671]  40% of confirmed new cases.
[01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:43.752]  Now, Doctor, it's a...
[01:03:47.216 --> 01:03:48.177]  That's super old numbers.
[01:03:48.197 --> 01:03:50.439]  Now it's over 85% of actually that are in the hospital.
[01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.141]  Go back to her.
[01:04:09.714 --> 01:04:10.435]  And here's the deal, guys.
[01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:33.820]  They're taking control of the normal human biological system and saying you don't have an immune system.
[01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:35.462]  Mothers can't give milk to babies.
[01:04:35.602 --> 01:04:37.003]  Women can't give birth vaginally.
[01:04:38.364 --> 01:04:39.605]  Your natural immunity doesn't work.
[01:04:39.865 --> 01:04:41.847]  We've got to put you in a bubble and control your life.
[01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:42.928]  Just stay in your bubble.
[01:04:42.948 --> 01:04:43.948]  Don't look at the sunset.
[01:04:44.189 --> 01:04:45.069]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:46.671]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:47.831]  This is the pod people.
[01:04:48.192 --> 01:04:49.773]  They're trying to make us the pod people.
[01:04:50.013 --> 01:04:50.694]  Wake up!
[01:04:50.934 --> 01:04:51.935]  Break your conditioning!
[01:04:56.178 --> 01:05:03.688]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:05:04.189 --> 01:05:13.682]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems.
[01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:17.965]  And returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:05:18.105 --> 01:05:22.329]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:26.652]  Where people aren't extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:05:26.892 --> 01:05:28.994]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:47.786]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:48.726]  InfoWars.
[01:05:49.087 --> 01:05:49.987]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:05:50.267 --> 01:05:50.708]  Today.
[01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:52.629]  This is it, men.
[01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.131]  Toe to toe with the globalists.
[01:05:59.153 --> 01:06:01.154]  We're not waiting for the new world order anymore.
[01:06:03.319 --> 01:06:04.499]  And now entered Mordor.
[01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:10.201]  And the globalists think they're going to trick us.
[01:06:10.221 --> 01:06:13.723]  They think they can get people to sign on to be left alone.
[01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.804]  And if you just give them a little freedom, the system will leave you alone.
[01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:22.126]  But every time you give up freedom, they demand even more.
[01:06:22.226 --> 01:06:24.066]  Look at how they told them, take the injections.
[01:06:24.787 --> 01:06:26.007]  And then you can not wear the mask.
[01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:27.128]  You can go wherever you want.
[01:06:27.268 --> 01:06:27.888]  Oh, sorry.
[01:06:28.328 --> 01:06:29.288]  Got to still wear the mask.
[01:06:29.308 --> 01:06:30.449]  Got to take more shots.
[01:06:31.633 --> 01:06:32.973]  Oh, and you're really sick now.
[01:06:33.233 --> 01:06:34.834]  Oh, the Delta variant's gonna get you.
[01:06:35.414 --> 01:06:38.555]  You're sick from the vaccine, because it's not a vaccine.
[01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.555]  It's growing prion crystals.
[01:06:40.595 --> 01:06:42.436]  You're diseasing others now.
[01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:46.777]  It's all a well laid out plan.
[01:06:50.158 --> 01:06:53.839]  And I can talk about answers on the way to resist this, and I'll do that next segment.
[01:06:54.639 --> 01:06:57.100]  But I wanted the time we have left in this segment to get into
[01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.677]  Currently the trajectory we're on.
[01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:03.340]  And again, I want to be extremely clear about this.
[01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:07.425]  We had all the white papers, the globalist plans, beta tests they'd done before.
[01:07:08.266 --> 01:07:11.370]  We were able to predict what they were going to do very accurately, but...
[01:07:14.718 --> 01:07:30.424]  They had a couple different battle plans going in the same direction and I personally, because they hadn't been moving too fast before, thought they would do a placebo vaccine and that they wouldn't start the real culling till later.
[01:07:30.804 --> 01:07:39.887]  But because they're so far behind, and I said this is the other possible path last year, is that this will make you really sick like all the scientists are saying.
[01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:41.828]  I just had trouble believing it, it was so shocking.
[01:07:45.253 --> 01:07:49.497]  That then they will say the unvaccinated are the reason that all the vaccinated are dying.
[01:07:50.778 --> 01:07:53.600]  And so they went with that plan.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.622]  They had several others.
[01:07:56.863 --> 01:08:05.351]  And so a lot of this is because the top Rothschilds have died.
[01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:07.393]  The top Rockefellers have died.
[01:08:08.689 --> 01:08:22.778]  And I know a lot of people that know the top people, and I mean, they are just involved in torturing and murdering people and devil worshipping and eating vats of feces and chopping their genitals off and torturing themselves.
[01:08:24.078 --> 01:08:25.539]  Folks, I'm not joking around, okay?
[01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:26.220]  This is not a joke.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.661]  I'm not just saying this for shock value.
[01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:29.121]  I think people have learned that by now.
[01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:36.686]  I told you all over the world, psychologists and psychiatrists at CPS place children with pedophiles in rape rooms worldwide.
[01:08:36.726 --> 01:08:37.747]  Now it's all over the news, okay?
[01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:39.591]  We're not making this up.
[01:08:41.392 --> 01:08:51.839]  In fact, I ran into some stuff last night doing research, which I already knew they were up to, but it's just, it's so horrible.
[01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:52.299]  God.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:53.980]  Sorry.
[01:08:56.202 --> 01:09:00.144]  Look, believe me, if you think I've gone there on how bad these guys are, you have no idea.
[01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:18.440]  Whether it's the DuPonts or whether it's the Rockefellers or whether it is the Vanderbilts, they are genetically completely turned over to hurting life.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.241]  When you see Anderson Cooper, you have to understand,
[01:09:22.611 --> 01:09:25.273]  He looks like a wraith since he was 20 for a reason.
[01:09:25.913 --> 01:09:28.815]  His full will is compromised by the dark side.
[01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:35.941]  And he has one thing, hurt people, hurt innocence, suck energy, destroy.
[01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:37.722]  Just like Bill Gates.
[01:09:39.543 --> 01:09:42.885]  And I'm digressing though.
[01:09:42.905 --> 01:09:45.948]  See, I start looking into their mindset and go down that rabbit trail.
[01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:50.151]  But these are predators from hell.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.561]  Imagine them as like tentacles reaching in from another dimension, trying to drag you in with them.
[01:09:56.402 --> 01:09:56.802]  That's it.
[01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:05.684]  And so, when you understand that, you understand that everything they are is betrayal.
[01:10:05.824 --> 01:10:07.205]  Everything they are is lies.
[01:10:07.785 --> 01:10:12.346]  Everything they are is inversion, because that is their God.
[01:10:12.446 --> 01:10:14.367]  They have purified themselves.
[01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:17.888]  They have sanctified themselves.
[01:10:19.907 --> 01:10:21.548]  In their satanic religion.
[01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:24.709]  And I'm glad the public's getting this.
[01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:31.893]  You know, last night, Tucker Carlson came out and said, you know, the operating system of Democrats really is satanism.
[01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:37.534]  And he got a lot of criticism for that.
[01:10:37.574 --> 01:10:39.035]  But actually, next segment, I'll hit that.
[01:10:39.555 --> 01:10:40.216]  That's important.
[01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.639]  But they had a movie came out a few years ago and saw it.
[01:10:43.919 --> 01:10:45.360]  That was the Alamo Draft House in Austin.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.323]  Movie theater packed with liberals celebrating, saying, hell, Satan, you name it.
[01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:53.046]  And the whole show is how the Democratic Party sees Republicans as Christians.
[01:10:53.467 --> 01:10:55.588]  So they've adopted Satanism as their religion.
[01:10:56.029 --> 01:10:57.850]  And they go, oh, we don't really believe in Satan.
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:58.971]  Just get involved in our group.
[01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:02.434]  But then it gets deeper into the movie and they really are Satanist.
[01:11:05.771 --> 01:11:09.134]  And so, that's what this whole thing is.
[01:11:11.536 --> 01:11:12.777]  And it's not a game.
[01:11:14.659 --> 01:11:18.122]  And once you turn yourself over to it, it takes you over.
[01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:26.249]  You can use the analogy of a ringwraith stabbing you with its poison blade and tip breaks off.
[01:11:26.289 --> 01:11:31.274]  If you don't get that tip out of you, it's gonna take you over, it's gonna kill you, it's gonna take your soul.
[01:11:32.162 --> 01:11:35.444]  And this is all about taking your will, because you may not respect yourself.
[01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.385]  You may not think you're an amazing creature.
[01:11:37.705 --> 01:11:39.226]  You may not think you're an incredible artist.
[01:11:39.526 --> 01:11:41.167]  You may not think your soul's beautiful.
[01:11:41.727 --> 01:11:42.587]  God made you.
[01:11:42.687 --> 01:11:43.988]  God thinks you're incredible.
[01:11:44.908 --> 01:11:46.149]  And you're quite a prize.
[01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:49.151]  The fact that you can see the beauty of a sunset.
[01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:51.612]  You know, my mother, I told this story 20 years ago.
[01:11:52.772 --> 01:11:53.913]  I told it again just last year.
[01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:57.735]  My mother said, you look at the sunset,
[01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:14.013]  And you look at the water, and the waves, and the beach, and you know it's beautiful, and you know it's good, and you commune with it, and you spiritually connect through God's creation to God, and that is a form of worship electromagnetically and spiritually to God.
[01:12:14.613 --> 01:12:17.776]  And God made us to experience this with Him.
[01:12:19.237 --> 01:12:22.639]  And what do they come out and say in Canada, in Australia, New Zealand?
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.642]  Do not look at the sunset!
[01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:41.335]  Well, statistically, if you look in the morning and at night, when it's low on the horizon, so it's not bad for your eyes, it's been known to massively boost your IQ long-term, to cure depression, you name it.
[01:12:42.976 --> 01:12:44.858]  Sungazing.
[01:12:44.898 --> 01:12:50.661]  Don't look at it once it's up high at all, but come out right when it's on the horizon, through the filter of the dust.
[01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:52.843]  That light just does something in your brain.
[01:12:54.741 --> 01:12:59.323]  And it's all these things God gave us they're trying to take away because these are Satanists.
[01:12:59.863 --> 01:13:05.125]  Do you think these Satanists go at dawn and dusk and stare at the sun?
[01:13:05.365 --> 01:13:06.125]  No, they don't.
[01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:08.726]  You think they like what God put up there?
[01:13:10.326 --> 01:13:11.767]  We don't worship the sun.
[01:13:12.147 --> 01:13:13.207]  It gives us all the life.
[01:13:13.307 --> 01:13:14.348]  God gave it to us.
[01:13:15.928 --> 01:13:17.349]  And it is an archetype of God.
[01:13:17.989 --> 01:13:19.069]  An archetype of his son.
[01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:20.930]  The ancients knew this.
[01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:21.710]  The Egyptians knew it.
[01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.670]  S-U-N-S-O-N.
[01:13:28.914 --> 01:13:31.636]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it's just that simple.
[01:13:32.236 --> 01:13:45.664]  All the studies show if you go out with barefoot on the grass, or you walk through the woods for just 10 minutes, depression's gone, and everything the enemy does is to take us out of that, and take us away from, that's the perfect way to look at the sun right there.
[01:13:46.244 --> 01:13:47.625]  That's what I do whenever I have the time.
[01:13:48.046 --> 01:13:51.628]  Anytime I'm upset or tired or really shook up, make sure I get up early, go out.
[01:13:52.949 --> 01:13:58.432]  There's a green belt behind my house, and I mean 10 minutes in the sun, oh my God, I am just totally connected to God.
[01:13:59.906 --> 01:14:00.626]  You wanna have a vision?
[01:14:01.027 --> 01:14:01.407]  Go do it.
[01:14:03.088 --> 01:14:04.309]  Because you're designed to do that.
[01:14:05.169 --> 01:14:06.710]  That's what all the other animals do when it comes up.
[01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.271]  They all come out and sit under it and look at it.
[01:14:09.452 --> 01:14:10.332]  They all celebrate it.
[01:14:10.892 --> 01:14:11.773]  We're all together.
[01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.174]  We're all connected to the whole universe, God gave us.
[01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:15.095]  We are with God.
[01:14:15.715 --> 01:14:21.839]  The enemy will never take that away from us, you murderers, you criminal scum, and you will pay for what you've done to our children.
[01:14:23.099 --> 01:14:25.301]  You know, I wanna do a human ritual with our listeners.
[01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:26.762]  I just thought of this during the break.
[01:14:27.442 --> 01:14:28.743]  I'll talk about it at the end of the show today.
[01:14:29.619 --> 01:14:54.228]  But I want everybody to pledge tonight and tomorrow night and the next night, because depending on where you are, the sun may not be clear in the sky, to only for like five minutes, right as it's setting, you know, the safe time to do it, to join me in gazing at God's incredible creation that gives us life and a celebration of life and to thank God.
[01:14:54.248 --> 01:14:58.570]  And the media will spin it and say it's an occult ritual, because that's the opposite.
[01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:02.673]  They're telling us don't go look at the sunset, don't look at the sunrise.
[01:15:03.914 --> 01:15:15.804]  And I would like to pledge to the listeners that at sundown central, it doesn't matter where you are in the world, at your sundown,
[01:15:17.864 --> 01:15:29.306]  That you go out for five minutes and just pray to God for a global awakening and pray to God for healing and pray to God to send light and love and good energy into the world to give people courage to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:15:30.467 --> 01:15:39.509]  Because especially in Northern Europe, they found massive suicides in studies in the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:15:39.549 --> 01:15:46.270]  And so they started putting in artificial sunlights, they started putting in special white walls and the suicide stopped.
[01:15:47.547 --> 01:15:57.356]  Uh, and again, it's a certain type of sunlight, especially at dusk and dawn, uh, that directly into the eyes does something to the cones and rods in the eyes that does something to the brain.
[01:15:58.477 --> 01:16:00.298]  And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's real.
[01:16:00.318 --> 01:16:03.581]  You know, that's, that's what sun creates almost all life on earth.
[01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:03.901]  99% of it.
[01:16:06.313 --> 01:16:10.338]  And so, they don't want us doing this because it's better than television.
[01:16:11.059 --> 01:16:12.661]  It's better than going to the movies.
[01:16:13.162 --> 01:16:16.026]  Hey, make a fire if you've got a fireplace outside.
[01:16:17.087 --> 01:16:17.968]  Go sit around that.
[01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:21.512]  I mean, it's simple stuff I'm saying, see?
[01:16:22.233 --> 01:16:23.295]  This is not rocket science.
[01:16:24.426 --> 01:16:25.507]  Spend time with your family.
[01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:26.267]  Love yourself.
[01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:26.967]  Love God.
[01:16:27.568 --> 01:16:28.668]  Don't let them put you down.
[01:16:28.728 --> 01:16:29.969]  Don't make them think you're ugly.
[01:16:30.009 --> 01:16:31.309]  Don't make them think you're a failure.
[01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.270]  Don't make them think you're a nobody.
[01:16:33.971 --> 01:16:35.791]  This whole worldly system is such a lie.
[01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:37.012]  You were made by God.
[01:16:38.113 --> 01:16:39.333]  And you know the truth.
[01:16:39.473 --> 01:16:43.655]  And knowing the truth and having that connection to truth is everything.
[01:16:45.236 --> 01:16:46.957]  Bill Gates is the poorest man in the world.
[01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:57.387]  Those of you that know God and know justice and have the satisfaction and the commitment and the feeling of beyond satisfaction.
[01:16:58.067 --> 01:16:59.087]  The word is completion.
[01:16:59.588 --> 01:17:00.328]  The word is peace.
[01:17:01.328 --> 01:17:02.148]  And we need that.
[01:17:03.329 --> 01:17:05.229]  And we need the forest.
[01:17:05.309 --> 01:17:06.530]  And we need the ocean.
[01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.590]  And we need the birds.
[01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.790]  We need the bees.
[01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:09.591]  And we need the sun.
[01:17:09.611 --> 01:17:10.351]  And we need the moon.
[01:17:10.711 --> 01:17:11.651]  And we need the stars.
[01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:17.413]  To realize that these little ugly monsters that seek to play God are going to be our testers.
[01:17:18.695 --> 01:17:20.437]  But they will be removed.
[01:17:21.298 --> 01:17:22.199]  They're the losers.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.441]  They're the village idiots.
[01:17:26.903 --> 01:17:28.164]  Let's talk about solutions.
[01:17:28.905 --> 01:17:40.096]  The Australian Prime Minister that poses as a Conservative acts like it's up to the regional governors, the premiers, to do what they want, but he's let them do the worst global control
[01:17:41.206 --> 01:17:42.267]  The planet's ever seen.
[01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:44.328]  I mean, this is beyond North Korea.
[01:17:44.348 --> 01:17:46.110]  This is beyond East Germany.
[01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:48.872]  This is beyond, and it's just, it's horrible.
[01:17:49.912 --> 01:17:50.853]  It's super abusive.
[01:17:50.893 --> 01:17:51.754]  It's beyond evil.
[01:17:52.574 --> 01:18:01.721]  And now he came out after he saw riots all over the country that overran the police, overran everything, because he knows the Aussies are going to start burning stuff down.
[01:18:02.862 --> 01:18:05.444]  And so he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's stop now.
[01:18:06.524 --> 01:18:08.366]  We'll have to accept one or two cases.
[01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:10.632]  Imagine one or two cases.
[01:18:11.132 --> 01:18:13.053]  They're just suppressing that their cases are in the country.
[01:18:14.154 --> 01:18:18.036]  I mean, police running people over, people, police stomping on people's heads.
[01:18:18.557 --> 01:18:23.179]  I mean, the Australian police are just a absolute menace.
[01:18:25.181 --> 01:18:27.682]  You don't see the left complaining about that.
[01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:34.906]  So just a week ago, their leader was saying, the lockdowns continue until 70% of you take this deadly shot, but it's your right not to take it.
[01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:37.208]  But now because the people are resisting,
[01:18:38.353 --> 01:18:39.354]  Well, you see what's happening.
[01:18:41.596 --> 01:18:46.039]  And because they understand that finally the public's finding its will, they're backing down.
[01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:47.580]  Same thing in the UK.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.462]  They're now taking over TV stations peacefully.
[01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:51.824]  We're trying to take our lives over.
[01:18:51.844 --> 01:18:53.024]  We're trying to take our bodies over.
[01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:54.466]  Trying to violate the Nuremberg Code.
[01:18:54.486 --> 01:18:55.606]  Trying to put something deadly in us.
[01:18:56.027 --> 01:18:57.168]  I mean, what do you want us to do?
[01:18:59.684 --> 01:19:10.966]  When you're pepper spraying people's children and stuff, you think the good guys that don't want power and don't want violence, you think when you beat our kids up and our wives up and our fathers and brothers up, you think it makes us go away?
[01:19:10.986 --> 01:19:15.047]  No, it makes us think about what we're going to do to you, and we will do something.
[01:19:15.087 --> 01:19:16.127]  Don't you worry about it.
[01:19:16.147 --> 01:19:17.848]  Oh, you're like, good, we'll call you terrorists.
[01:19:17.928 --> 01:19:18.368]  Oh, really?
[01:19:18.908 --> 01:19:20.448]  You'll just get the whole party going, won't you?
[01:19:20.588 --> 01:19:22.068]  You can't even hold Afghanistan.
[01:19:22.288 --> 01:19:25.149]  You can't run your blue cities full of feces and fentanyl.
[01:19:26.218 --> 01:19:30.482]  All you can do is murder us all day and sit around and slap yourselves on the back.
[01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:34.105]  But I see the videos of Nancy Pelosi's parties and Barack Obama's parties.
[01:19:34.405 --> 01:19:40.551]  It looks like a bunch of trash and a bunch of unhappy garbage that all know they're losers and all know they're jokes.
[01:19:41.752 --> 01:19:46.236]  All a bunch of posing fakes that signed on the wrong side of the universe.
[01:19:49.804 --> 01:19:50.925]  Powerful video coming up.
[01:19:51.726 --> 01:19:53.127]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:19:53.487 --> 01:19:58.952]  Los Angeles Fire Department Captain under investigation for video slamming COVID vaccine tyranny.
[01:19:59.192 --> 01:19:59.713]  Well, you know what?
[01:19:59.833 --> 01:20:01.694]  You're under investigation for tyranny.
[01:20:01.974 --> 01:20:05.457]  You're under investigation for pushing a depopulation weapon on us globalists.
[01:20:05.738 --> 01:20:07.900]  You're under investigation for trying to censor us.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.402]  You're under investigation, New World Order!
[01:20:11.963 --> 01:20:21.859]  I ain't got all your ten badges in your Justice Department crap, but I got justice and freedom and human history on my side, and the tyrants are zero, and humanity's batting a thousand.
[01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:25.945]  Let's talk about this because I mentioned it.
[01:20:26.265 --> 01:20:31.547]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night talking about Satanism being the Democratic Party's operating system.
[01:20:32.147 --> 01:20:35.968]  They say that in the high-budget film, Hail Satan!
[01:20:35.988 --> 01:20:41.269]  And they go all over the country and show the Democrats saying they're Satanists in huge parties, and that is who they are.
[01:20:41.509 --> 01:20:42.210]  I've been around them.
[01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:42.750]  I've seen it.
[01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.470]  So here it is.
[01:20:45.851 --> 01:20:47.311]  ...and destroying this country.
[01:20:49.305 --> 01:20:54.449]  What do you think, I've always wondered this, like what is the actual support for the ideas?
[01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:59.454]  Not, you know, do you like Trump or Biden, but for example, do you think men can get pregnant?
[01:20:59.634 --> 01:21:03.457]  Or do you think some races are morally superior to other races?
[01:21:03.497 --> 01:21:05.038]  Like the core idea is the Democratic Party.
[01:21:05.418 --> 01:21:08.101]  How many Americans actually believe that stuff, would you guess?
[01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:15.055]  I don't think 5% of America believes it, maybe.
[01:21:16.235 --> 01:21:15.055]  10%?
[01:21:16.255 --> 01:21:17.036]  I don't know.
[01:21:17.616 --> 01:21:23.599]  Tucker, I'm going to say something difficult to unpack in this short amount of time, but it's what I truly believe.
[01:21:23.959 --> 01:21:26.920]  I think a lot of what the left supports is satanic.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.760]  I'm just sorry.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.842]  It's in direct objection to God.
[01:21:32.302 --> 01:21:33.003]  Yes, it was hard.
[01:21:48.945 --> 01:22:06.679]  But our Christian values compelled us to sacrifice our lives for the freedoms of other Americans, of slaves, and through the Civil Rights Movement, our Christian values compelled us to take risks and fight for equality and the equality of opportunity for everybody.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:15.086]  I just, I see a lot of what's going on here is, and I'm just sorry, I'm a man of faith, I was raised in the church,
[01:22:15.786 --> 01:22:17.146]  This stuff is satanic.
[01:22:17.426 --> 01:22:19.667]  That's what's at the foundation of a lot of this stuff.
[01:22:20.567 --> 01:22:20.967]  That's right.
[01:22:21.147 --> 01:22:24.488]  Well, I'm a pretty mild Protestant, personally, but I completely agree with you.
[01:22:24.808 --> 01:22:25.728]  Especially the gender stuff.
[01:22:25.748 --> 01:22:29.468]  When you say you can change your own gender by wishing it, you're saying you're God.
[01:22:30.289 --> 01:22:31.269]  And that is satanic.
[01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:32.389]  I completely agree.
[01:22:32.769 --> 01:22:33.529]  That's right.
[01:22:35.109 --> 01:22:40.930]  But it's all about gaslighting us where they say what they want, when they want, and they make us accept it.
[01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.511]  And Bathelmette is, doing the whole deal, is
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:46.961]  Bi-gendered.
[01:22:48.122 --> 01:22:50.704]  So that's what this whole thing is, is Satanism.
[01:22:51.665 --> 01:22:53.766]  That's why Mel Gibson did a great job in Passion of the Christ.
[01:22:53.806 --> 01:22:56.829]  You notice the devil in that is a hermaphrodite.
[01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:59.772]  So, powerful information.
[01:22:59.812 --> 01:23:00.973]  You'll see the film Hell's Satan.
[01:23:01.673 --> 01:23:04.316]  I mean, the whole thing is the Democratic Party are now Satanists.
[01:23:04.376 --> 01:23:09.220]  And you go out to their events, undercover, they talk about how much they love Satan and all of it.
[01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:20.170]  And they're really just a bunch of really soft, weird nerds that know Satan rules the planet, and they just want some petty power.
[01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:27.612]  And then they also make jokes about, oh, it doesn't exist, there's not really Satanism, but then that's how they suck everybody into it to control them.
[01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:34.594]  Yeah, Owen goes out to the abortion rallies, and they literally, the majority of them are, I want to kill babies, I love Satan.
[01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:37.572]  And they're just demonic.
[01:23:37.893 --> 01:23:40.494]  The women act like rabid dogs or something.
[01:23:41.135 --> 01:23:42.216]  And this is what they've been turned into.
[01:23:42.256 --> 01:23:43.997]  They don't love men, they don't love women, they love nobody.
[01:23:44.017 --> 01:23:46.399]  They just run around and Satan, Satan, kill, kill.
[01:23:46.899 --> 01:23:48.741]  We're going to come back with our special guest.
[01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:51.543]  This video went super, super ultra viral.
[01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:54.765]  And by the way, that video's up on Bandot Video.
[01:23:54.825 --> 01:23:58.308]  I hope that you share the video by Dr. Sean M. Brooks.
[01:23:58.888 --> 01:23:59.448]  Ph.D.
[01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:01.710]  over 1,100,000 views right now.
[01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:05.253]  He'll be joining us to really have the floor coming up separately.

[01:24:28.789 --> 01:24:30.431]  We'll be back with our number three.
[01:24:47.628 --> 01:24:52.189]  While the mockingbird media implodes over Biden's Afghanistan disaster.
[01:24:52.209 --> 01:24:57.951]  I heard President Biden say yesterday in his comments to ABC News that this is not a failure.
[01:24:57.991 --> 01:25:09.695]  And I think a lot of people outside that airport, particularly those taking the kinds of extreme actions we're just talking about, would like to know if this isn't failure, what does failure look like exactly?
[01:25:10.075 --> 01:25:11.855]  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining me, sir.
[01:25:12.355 --> 01:25:14.256]  You know this territory very well.
[01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:16.697]  Is President Biden right on this?
[01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:28.827]  The question of leaving is one thing, and that's an arguable decision, but the manner of the leaving has been an absolute disaster, totally lacking in planning.
[01:25:29.514 --> 01:25:29.734]  I think
[01:25:51.185 --> 01:25:59.813]  The dissent memo and these cables now from the Afghan employees at the State Department we've got in the last 24 hours are devastating.
[01:26:00.394 --> 01:26:01.935]  We have destroyed morale.
[01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:09.262]  Those addicted to the lie are dancing in the streets while thousands of Americans are trapped behind enemy lines.
[01:26:09.542 --> 01:26:09.802]  I think?
[01:26:39.922 --> 01:26:56.812]  But those who live by the propaganda will die by the propaganda as Brian Stelter's wrong-think spectacle flipped the script on the historical disaster clinging to the radical left ideology supporting the senile Joe Biden no matter what he does.
[01:26:57.332 --> 01:27:03.836]  Biden, quote, has stuck to his guns while under attack in the press, laying out a case for the limits of American military power.
[01:27:04.336 --> 01:27:08.299]  So, Matthew Dowd, you would describe the media's coverage this week as what?
[01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:13.981]  Way over the top and unconnected to a perspective on the issue from the beginning.
[01:27:14.761 --> 01:27:20.383]  They've added more perspective in the final days, but from the beginning, they didn't have a perspective on it.
[01:27:20.843 --> 01:27:28.145]  My sense of this is Joe Biden has done, we should judge it by the data of what's happened and not by anecdotes.
[01:27:28.465 --> 01:27:34.087]  And sometimes the president or the press has a tendency to judge things by anecdotes and not the data.
[01:27:34.147 --> 01:27:35.828]  And the data for the last week,
[01:27:36.508 --> 01:27:42.352]  Shows Joe Biden has basically gotten 30,000 people out of Afghanistan without a single loss of an American life.
[01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:48.936]  I think that we also see why it was so hard for presidents in the past to pull out of Afghanistan.
[01:27:48.976 --> 01:27:52.118]  They were afraid of exactly this kind of press overreaction.
[01:27:52.658 --> 01:27:58.021]  There's no way to surrender, leave, withdraw, whatever you want to call it, in a war.
[01:27:58.922 --> 01:28:07.344]  House Speaker Pelosi, who just held a maskless luncheon in Napa Valley while the servants wore masks, laughably praised Biden's undeniable debacle, writing, I want to acknowledge the clarity
[01:28:24.787 --> 01:28:26.648]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:32.952]  I'm just so proud of all of our reporters and all of our people that file reports like John Bowne and Greg Reese and everybody else.
[01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:53.792]  I mean, that's three reports that Brown filed today.
[01:28:53.852 --> 01:28:56.495]  They're all absolutely excellent.
[01:28:57.156 --> 01:29:04.384]  And one of the big reports he just filed today deals with Pfizer's whole history of experimental deadly drugs and secret testing.
[01:29:04.784 --> 01:29:07.707]  Now they're the most fine, most indicted company out there.
[01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:13.011]  And that's a very important report dealing with the Global Rebellion starting against that.
[01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:13.871]  So that's all coming up.
[01:29:14.172 --> 01:29:15.152]  I really wanted to get him on.
[01:29:15.272 --> 01:29:16.313]  The crew got him.
[01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:19.355]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., very well spoken.
[01:29:20.015 --> 01:29:21.376]  He's with us straight ahead.
[01:29:21.436 --> 01:29:24.278]  We'll replay what he said at the school board and then we'll go right to him.
[01:29:26.079 --> 01:29:31.182]  Well, we've played clips of probably 500 doctors and scientists and nurses or more.
[01:29:31.222 --> 01:29:33.243]  I mean, higher like 10 or 15 a day, sometimes 20, 30 a day.
[01:29:37.725 --> 01:29:47.277]  But there was a particular video of a PhD in education, stands up to school board, says vaccine will die, that I really thought was powerful and well said.
[01:29:47.678 --> 01:29:48.559]  When I plugged it, it had 87,000 views.
[01:29:48.579 --> 01:29:49.179]  It's got 1,091,000 views at Band.Video.
[01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:49.980]  I hope all of you will share it.
[01:29:56.929 --> 01:29:58.391]  And I'm really excited to get him on.
[01:29:58.411 --> 01:30:03.575]  We've got several medical doctors that are huge joining us tomorrow to talk about this.
[01:30:03.595 --> 01:30:05.577]  We've had epidemiologists, we've had scientists.
[01:30:05.998 --> 01:30:10.162]  You've seen the former chief scientist at Pfizer go public and say the vaccine's deadly.
[01:30:10.422 --> 01:30:13.305]  You've seen the head advisor to the EU say it's deadly.
[01:30:15.106 --> 01:30:16.788]  But those people get censored.
[01:30:18.257 --> 01:30:24.382]  It doesn't matter if you're a school teacher, it doesn't matter if you're an auto mechanic, it doesn't matter if you're a mother whose son took the vaccine and died.
[01:30:24.582 --> 01:30:25.884]  That stuff's happening out of young people.
[01:30:26.464 --> 01:30:27.845]  All of you should go be heard.
[01:30:27.865 --> 01:30:31.488]  All of you should speak out because the system doesn't want you to be heard.
[01:30:31.789 --> 01:30:34.851]  But our guest, when we producer got him on the phone yesterday, wanted to talk to me.
[01:30:34.871 --> 01:30:36.533]  He said, listen, I want to clear something up.
[01:30:37.593 --> 01:30:42.196]  I went to that high school, and I was there, and I'm a well-known Ph.D.
[01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:45.798]  in education, and when you're there, you say what town you live in, it's Oxford.
[01:30:45.858 --> 01:30:49.440]  I'm not a doctor from Oxford, because the internet had been saying that, so that's cleared up.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.261]  But, do you still want me on?
[01:30:51.642 --> 01:31:00.187]  I said, yeah, now that I know who you are, I've seen your writings before, and I've heard about some of your books, I really want you on the show, because you're an articulate person, and it doesn't matter if you're a Ph.D.
[01:31:00.227 --> 01:31:03.308]  in education, or a medical doctor, or a school teacher,
[01:31:04.489 --> 01:31:07.791]  As I said, some guy that, you know, throws people's bushes for a living.
[01:31:08.292 --> 01:31:11.974]  We're all humans and can observe what's going on and speak out.
[01:31:12.054 --> 01:31:13.955]  But I love the viral video.
[01:31:14.015 --> 01:31:15.036]  It's very to the point.
[01:31:15.516 --> 01:31:16.477]  It's warning people.
[01:31:16.557 --> 01:31:17.497]  It's what they need to hear.
[01:31:17.817 --> 01:31:22.880]  So here's what you had to say to the school board, your alma mater, and we'll come back to you for the next hour and 30 minutes or so.
[01:31:22.921 --> 01:31:25.502]  And then Owen Schroyer is going to be joining us as well.
[01:31:25.542 --> 01:31:27.543]  But Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., is here.
[01:31:27.884 --> 01:31:29.865]  AmericanEducationFM.com.
[01:31:30.325 --> 01:31:32.146]  But here's what he had to say in the viral video.
[01:31:44.244 --> 01:31:46.586]  Brother disappointed.
[01:31:46.606 --> 01:31:52.231]  My name is Dr. Sean Brooks, Ph.D., Oxford.
[01:31:53.592 --> 01:31:56.595]  I have 48 publications including 23 books.
[01:31:56.615 --> 01:31:59.858]  I've studied health medicine, anatomy and physiology for approximately 21 years.
[01:32:01.718 --> 01:32:10.864]  Dr. Robert Malone who created the messenger RNA vaccine has said no one should ever take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever.
[01:32:11.224 --> 01:32:13.926]  He created it and he says don't ever do it.
[01:32:14.346 --> 01:32:17.328]  So let me explain what's going to happen to the people who have taken it.
[01:32:18.589 --> 01:32:24.332]  The people who have taken it are going to die in the next six months to three to five years for three reasons.
[01:32:25.933 --> 01:32:29.536]  You've dramatically decreased your own immune system by 35%.
[01:32:29.636 --> 01:32:33.279]  The first jab did it by at least 15.
[01:32:33.319 --> 01:32:35.381]  The second did it by 35 now.
[01:32:35.961 --> 01:32:38.123]  If you take any booster shot, you will die.
[01:32:38.844 --> 01:32:39.244]  That's it.
[01:32:40.085 --> 01:32:42.527]  You take a flu shot in the future, you will die.
[01:32:44.048 --> 01:32:44.809]  The second reason.
[01:32:45.276 --> 01:32:46.877]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:52.219]  Antibody Dependent Enhancement is what is happening with these jabs with everybody who has taken them.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.340]  Unless, of course, you've taken a placebo.
[01:32:54.781 --> 01:32:56.161]  But there's no way that you would know that.
[01:32:56.902 --> 01:33:04.865]  So given that fact, Antibody Dependent Enhancement tricks the entire body into believing that the cell that's eating the pathogen is eating it when it isn't.
[01:33:05.506 --> 01:33:09.968]  It ends up leading to what's called a cytokine storm, which causes organ failure.
[01:33:11.598 --> 01:33:14.160]  That will cause your death, and there's no stopping that.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.042]  No amount of drugs will stop that.
[01:33:16.462 --> 01:33:18.244]  The third thing, blood clotting.
[01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:21.907]  Everyone who has taken the jabs is blood clotting.
[01:33:22.047 --> 01:33:24.529]  If you don't believe me, there's a way you can find out.
[01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:26.771]  Take what's called a D-dimer test.
[01:33:27.692 --> 01:33:28.413]  What that does...
[01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:32.485]  Is that detects blood clotting at the microscopic level.
[01:33:33.286 --> 01:33:35.868]  They're cutting full blood clots out of people right now.
[01:33:36.068 --> 01:33:39.030]  As I'm talking to you, millions have died from the jabs.
[01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:46.355]  In your last meeting, you advocated for people to take the jabs potentially in the future, along with wearing masks.
[01:33:46.475 --> 01:33:48.197]  And I heard parents say the same thing.
[01:33:48.597 --> 01:33:54.601]  So to the parents who are actually considering jabbing their own children, you're going to sterilize them permanently.
[01:33:55.442 --> 01:33:57.944]  People who have taken the jabs are sterilized.
[01:33:59.468 --> 01:34:03.757]  80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their children in the first trimester.
[01:34:04.999 --> 01:34:06.001]  You can't have kids!
[01:34:07.793 --> 01:34:10.815]  You've also injected yourself with the equivalent of HIV.
[01:34:11.235 --> 01:34:18.580]  You can no longer breastfeed, donate blood, donate organs, donate blood plasma, nor bone marrow.
[01:34:19.101 --> 01:34:23.824]  If you don't believe me, try to donate blood and blood plasma and find out what happens.
[01:34:24.464 --> 01:34:25.385]  You will be denied.
[01:34:26.166 --> 01:34:32.970]  Unless, of course, you live in California, in which case they're allowing people to donate toxic blood with spike proteins in it.
[01:34:33.451 --> 01:34:35.432]  The jabs create spike proteins,
[01:34:36.277 --> 01:34:42.642]  They're in the jabs themselves, and they create it by snapping your RNA in half.
[01:34:42.762 --> 01:34:45.024]  You are no longer a human anymore.
[01:34:45.325 --> 01:34:46.325]  You are something else.
[01:34:47.526 --> 01:34:49.708]  And you are susceptible to countless diseases.
[01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:52.971]  Now here's what's going to happen in the future very quickly.
[01:34:52.991 --> 01:34:55.093]  You have 15 seconds.
[01:34:55.153 --> 01:34:55.513]  Great.
[01:34:55.773 --> 01:35:00.037]  I don't know what percentage of your staff has taken the jabs, but your school is going to close.
[01:35:00.077 --> 01:35:01.198]  You will not stay open.
[01:35:01.698 --> 01:35:04.361]  You will close because they will fall ill and they will die.
[01:35:05.168 --> 01:35:06.790]  That will happen in all of your buildings.
[01:35:07.091 --> 01:35:08.493]  It's already happening.
[01:35:08.513 --> 01:35:09.014]  Thank you, sir.
[01:35:09.474 --> 01:35:10.336]  I bet it is.
[01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:11.678]  It's already happening.
[01:35:11.718 --> 01:35:12.479]  Good luck.
[01:35:12.539 --> 01:35:13.540]  Nothing can stop it.
[01:35:13.581 --> 01:35:14.021]  Thank you, sir.
[01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:21.379]  All right, so we need to be alarmist about this, because this is the big globalist move, and everything he says you can document.
[01:35:21.659 --> 01:35:23.541]  In fact, he says 80% in first trimester.
[01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:25.762]  Actually, New England Medical Journal, it's like 83%.
[01:35:27.203 --> 01:35:28.464]  So he's being conservative.
[01:35:28.784 --> 01:35:30.185]  He's a smart guy, well-spoken.
[01:35:30.245 --> 01:35:31.125]  I wanted to get him on.
[01:35:31.545 --> 01:35:34.407]  I appreciate Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, coming on in short notice.
[01:35:34.747 --> 01:35:42.272]  Former public school teachers of math, science, health education, anatomy, psychology, and former adjunct university professor, teacher education.
[01:35:42.692 --> 01:35:45.334]  Dr. Brooks is the author of several books on the violence of school crime.
[01:35:45.974 --> 01:35:47.515]  He's got three minutes to break.
[01:35:47.595 --> 01:35:49.996]  Really appreciate you coming on, Doc.
[01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:53.258]  So much to talk about, but what do you want to just say out of the gates?
[01:36:14.704 --> 01:36:16.185]  First of all, thank you for having me on.
[01:36:16.425 --> 01:36:17.105]  I appreciate it.
[01:36:18.065 --> 01:36:20.866]  I haven't taught psychology.
[01:36:20.926 --> 01:36:23.728]  I taught physiology, anatomy and physiology at the high school level.
[01:36:23.768 --> 01:36:29.770]  But again, this is a subject that you study when you're studying with your bachelor's degree.
[01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:31.331]  So yeah, I'm 40 years old.
[01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:33.712]  I've been studying this since I was 18, 19 years old.
[01:36:35.952 --> 01:36:39.954]  I would just encourage people to watch the entire school board meeting.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:45.924]  Because the context matters and the context in every school board meeting matters from beginning to end.
[01:36:46.004 --> 01:37:05.679]  I know that a lot of people grab clips and they just stick with the clip, but I do want to later on set up the entire school board meeting because the individual who spoke in front of me was a pediatrician in town and he was advocating for the masks and he was advocating for the jabs and there's this consistent tone that's occurring where
[01:37:06.365 --> 01:37:09.147]  They want everybody masked until they get the jabs.
[01:37:09.228 --> 01:37:13.691]  But what we've already seen is, is that they're fine pulling back on that.
[01:37:14.532 --> 01:37:17.735]  Even if they've had the jabs, they're still having to wear the masks.
[01:37:18.616 --> 01:37:27.343]  So I was watching a pattern happen from back in January in school board meetings where people weren't mentioning the jabs at all.
[01:37:28.104 --> 01:37:30.546]  It was all CRT and all mask wearing.
[01:37:31.055 --> 01:37:31.555]  That was it.
[01:37:32.056 --> 01:37:42.605]  And I kept saying on my podcast and I set it up a long, long time ago, I said, I'm probably going to have to go to this, go to one of these maybe and start talking about the jabs, but I'm going to take a back seat.
[01:37:43.206 --> 01:37:46.869]  I'm going to be conservative about this and I'm going to wait to see if someone else does it.
[01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:50.212]  And I didn't hear anybody do it for six plus months.
[01:37:51.253 --> 01:37:55.497]  And then I thought, well, there's an upcoming board meeting.
[01:37:56.283 --> 01:37:58.385]  At my old high school in the town where I live.
[01:37:58.465 --> 01:38:01.569]  So I'm going to see what they talked about in their last meeting.
[01:38:01.769 --> 01:38:18.347]  I watched the entire last school board meeting and gleefully, they were talking about how they had mandated masks now for K through five, but not six through 12, that that was optional.
[01:38:19.192 --> 01:38:31.348]  But they were still, you could hear it in their voices, that they were talking about, we need the jabs, we need to make this mandatory for our staff members, we need to make this ultimately mandatory for our students, and we have to move in that direction.
[01:38:31.775 --> 01:38:34.777]  That's very problematic for a variety of reasons.
[01:38:34.857 --> 01:38:38.339]  Extremely hectic, especially because it's poisonous and doesn't work.
[01:38:38.359 --> 01:38:48.806]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about the big picture and why you got so upset and why you hit him so hard with that freezing cold water to get him out of their trance to realize this isn't a game.
[01:38:48.866 --> 01:38:49.727]  Because, yeah.
[01:38:50.567 --> 01:38:54.289]  Once people are dying later, they're going to say, oh, it's a new variant or unvaccinated.
[01:38:54.609 --> 01:38:57.290]  We've got to tell them up front, it's the shot killed you.
[01:38:57.670 --> 01:38:59.251]  So at least then they'll know what hit them.
[01:38:59.651 --> 01:39:01.392]  We're to that triage point now, folks.
[01:39:02.032 --> 01:39:02.672]  This guy's smart.
[01:39:02.692 --> 01:39:03.573]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:39:03.613 --> 01:39:05.433]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD.
[01:39:05.493 --> 01:39:06.274]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:39:06.894 --> 01:39:07.394]  Stay with us.
[01:39:09.095 --> 01:39:09.715]  Welcome back.
[01:39:09.795 --> 01:39:12.856]  I have some massive breaking news that ties into all this.
[01:39:13.417 --> 01:39:16.398]  I'm going to wait till next segment to drop it on the audience and our guest.
[01:39:18.544 --> 01:39:23.829]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, author, researcher, podcaster, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:27.852]  Very excited listeners decided to share his four-minute video.
[01:39:29.554 --> 01:39:31.876]  He runs the American Education FM.
[01:39:32.476 --> 01:39:34.057]  You can see him right there on Gab.
[01:39:34.097 --> 01:39:35.719]  Be sure and follow him.
[01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:41.103]  But, Doc, you've got the floor of this segment, but I want to just ask you a big picture.
[01:39:41.684 --> 01:39:43.786]  What would you call this time in history?
[01:39:44.346 --> 01:39:45.888]  How would you define the globalist?
[01:39:48.144 --> 01:39:51.125]  I mean, where do you in the big picture think this is going?
[01:39:51.165 --> 01:39:53.146]  Because I see the evidence overwhelming.
[01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:54.747]  This is their big revolution.
[01:39:55.067 --> 01:39:55.987]  They're peddling the metal.
[01:39:56.027 --> 01:40:03.030]  They're completely committed, trying to collapse civilization, but then poses the saviors and bringing a new dark age in their own words.
[01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:06.772]  I mean, I just don't think people understand the magnitude of what we're facing.
[01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.313]  Do you disagree with that statement?
[01:40:08.333 --> 01:40:09.893]  And what would you call this time we're in right now?
[01:40:10.854 --> 01:40:11.374]  It's war.
[01:40:13.315 --> 01:40:14.095]  It's that simple.
[01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:14.795]  It's war.
[01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:27.289]  People are dying and there isn't a single person in the world, I don't think, who this has impacted in some way.
[01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:30.432]  So I've had family members who have taken the jabs.
[01:40:31.353 --> 01:40:32.154]  I'm fully aware.
[01:40:32.174 --> 01:40:34.476]  This has impacted everybody.
[01:40:35.036 --> 01:40:36.317]  You know, they're not fully awake.
[01:40:36.377 --> 01:40:37.538]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:40:37.658 --> 01:40:39.460]  Cognitive dissonance is very strong.
[01:40:40.101 --> 01:40:41.222]  I fully understand that.
[01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:44.965]  But fortunately, I woke up a long time ago.
[01:40:45.954 --> 01:40:50.919]  And when you've been through the ringer in the K-12 system, and then you leave the K-12 system.
[01:40:50.959 --> 01:40:53.042]  And I mean, I was through the ringer as a whistleblower.
[01:40:53.122 --> 01:40:58.347]  So I mean, I went all the way through State Departments of Education and all the way back down.
[01:40:58.748 --> 01:41:00.390]  I saw how they all operate.
[01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.412]  I watched the entire thing.
[01:41:03.172 --> 01:41:05.315]  And again, I'm not calling myself a victim.
[01:41:05.515 --> 01:41:06.296]  I'm just saying that
[01:41:06.943 --> 01:41:09.806]  In K-12 education, there are a lot of whistleblowers out there.
[01:41:11.167 --> 01:41:15.631]  Sure, you experienced how the bureaucracy destroys young minds and how the fraud works.
[01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:17.472]  You're saying you've been through the process.
[01:41:18.293 --> 01:41:18.753]  That's right.
[01:41:19.314 --> 01:41:23.978]  And as you would expect, state departments of education are remarkably corrupt.
[01:41:24.438 --> 01:41:25.699]  They stamp papers.
[01:41:25.739 --> 01:41:26.820]  They move things forward.
[01:41:27.201 --> 01:41:28.942]  School teachers can lawyer up all they want.
[01:41:29.062 --> 01:41:31.965]  It doesn't help, typically speaking anyway.
[01:41:32.245 --> 01:41:33.786]  Unions claim to stand up for them.
[01:41:33.806 --> 01:41:34.507]  They tend not to.
[01:41:35.733 --> 01:41:50.398]  It's just a giant con game, and what we're watching, not just is a global war here in my opinion, is that we're watching the systematic destruction of K-12 education and higher education, and frankly, it cannot be saved.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:53.381]  People need to run away from these institutions.
[01:41:53.882 --> 01:41:56.523]  They've, in my opinion, they've shown their own hands.
[01:41:56.544 --> 01:41:57.064]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:41:57.084 --> 01:41:58.205]  They're the cancer points.
[01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:05.149]  The globalists are using these as the invasion ports to collapse the rest of everything, just like the blue cities are designed to collapse everything.
[01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:06.510]  Right.
[01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:11.033]  And they're basically seeing how much they can get away with and how much people will tolerate.
[01:42:11.093 --> 01:42:16.657]  Well, one of the interesting things is, is I taught the cycle of abuse formally when I was a school teacher.
[01:42:16.977 --> 01:42:18.378]  I taught students what that was.
[01:42:19.369 --> 01:42:24.871]  And what K-12 schools are engaging in, and higher education institutions are engaging in, is the cycle of abuse.
[01:42:25.251 --> 01:42:30.553]  They want to see how many people will come back to the environment and continue to be punched in the face.
[01:42:31.213 --> 01:42:39.856]  And then they give them flowers, or they give them an award, or they give them a pat on the back, and they just want to see how many times they'll come back and continue to get punched in the face.
[01:42:41.137 --> 01:42:47.399]  I'm sorry, but, and I've said it on my podcast a million times, there's no unhealthier environment right now.
[01:42:47.850 --> 01:42:59.297]  Because when you talk about workplace bullying, as the phenomenon that it is, K-12 education and hospitals are two of the largest environments where workplace bullying takes place.
[01:42:59.317 --> 01:43:03.239]  Exactly, they've been turned into basically open-air re-education camps.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.521]  They're laboratories of social control.
[01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:07.762]  Hospitals and schools.
[01:43:08.783 --> 01:43:09.263]  That's right.
[01:43:09.363 --> 01:43:16.908]  And when you abuse the people, the adults who are working there, who are trying to help, allegedly, and many of them do, and they do luminous work,
[01:43:18.658 --> 01:43:23.742]  It's inevitable that the mind of that individual is going to break and snap.
[01:43:25.103 --> 01:43:31.028]  It's inevitable that that's going to have a negative impact on the students that they're responsible for teaching factual information to.
[01:43:31.489 --> 01:43:33.871]  And that's why the turnover rate is as high as it is.
[01:43:34.251 --> 01:43:39.676]  And it's only increased in American K-12 education, higher education, and nurses.
[01:43:40.196 --> 01:43:41.337]  The difference now is
[01:43:42.639 --> 01:43:45.500]  We're seeing individuals leave for a variety of reasons.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:56.805]  And the last reason is making them physically ill by a jab that is being either mandated or they're asking to be mandated on a number of different people.
[01:43:57.225 --> 01:44:01.587]  We already have the state of California that's told all school teachers they have to take it.
[01:44:02.347 --> 01:44:06.108]  We already have the state of Washington that has told all teachers they have to take it.
[01:44:06.749 --> 01:44:10.190]  And I'm not, I could be wrong here, but I think just the other day,
[01:44:11.335 --> 01:44:16.080]  It was all Washington DC schools, all their staff members had to take it also.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.341]  Let's expand on that.
[01:44:17.401 --> 01:44:21.525]  They're spinning it, Dr. Brooks, that, oh, that we've always had mandates.
[01:44:21.545 --> 01:44:22.726]  Yeah, they've had fake mandates.
[01:44:22.746 --> 01:44:25.449]  You've got to get a vaccine waiver from the health department.
[01:44:25.749 --> 01:44:30.474]  They've never had it where you've got to have this to get on a plane or a train or have a job.
[01:44:30.534 --> 01:44:31.255]  This is un...
[01:44:31.775 --> 01:44:47.642]  Precedented plus they want proof of it in a digital tracking system, which they admit is the backbone of a global ID System which they'll then have carbon taxes added to so we are literally having the chains fitted on us right now Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:47.702 --> 01:44:55.646]  I mean it's the old I saw a meme just the other day It's it's that it's the chain dog when you chain a dog to a to a post or a tree and
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.202]  It will inevitably become very angry.
[01:44:59.702 --> 01:45:05.207]  But when you remove one link at a time, it will just continue to get used to the chain.
[01:45:05.748 --> 01:45:08.330]  And then eventually they're right up against the tree and they can't even move.
[01:45:09.311 --> 01:45:10.091]  And that's happening.
[01:45:10.151 --> 01:45:13.934]  But what's not being reported is one of the things that I always pay attention to.
[01:45:13.954 --> 01:45:16.497]  Because again, I see the landscape like a lot of people do.
[01:45:16.537 --> 01:45:20.460]  And having studied qualitative reasoning and analysis, you look at the entire landscape.
[01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:24.972]  Having published research articles in XYZ, you have to do that.
[01:45:25.012 --> 01:45:26.653]  You have to be able to make predictions.
[01:45:26.673 --> 01:45:29.015]  You have to be able to see what's happened, what's coming.
[01:45:29.455 --> 01:45:36.579]  And at the end of those articles, you do have to say, hey, look, if this happens, then this is likely to happen down the line.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:42.123]  If this doesn't happen, what's been discovered in research, then this is likely to happen on down the line.
[01:45:42.543 --> 01:45:47.746]  So what I said in the board meeting is even Dr. Mike Yeadon agreed with me.
[01:45:47.786 --> 01:45:50.648]  I mean, he said it's possible, if not plausible.
[01:45:51.488 --> 01:45:56.889]  So, I want people to understand the context of why I said what I said at the end, because that matters.
[01:45:57.515 --> 01:45:58.996]  I'm not worried about Dr. Malone.
[01:45:59.016 --> 01:46:00.997]  He's wishy-washy as far as I'm concerned.
[01:46:01.017 --> 01:46:02.357]  He hasn't taken a hard stance against it.
[01:46:02.377 --> 01:46:02.938]  No, but you're right.
[01:46:03.218 --> 01:46:05.279]  This is designed to collapse civilization.
[01:46:05.739 --> 01:46:11.842]  It's a post-industrial plan, signed into global law, 2002, Rio de Janeiro, agenda 21.
[01:46:13.163 --> 01:46:16.384]  Even if 20% get sick or 10% die, it collapses civilization.
[01:46:16.765 --> 01:46:19.086]  The evidence from the studies is going to be far higher.
[01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:23.408]  So what you're doing is you're warning them so they know up front what's about to hit them, right?
[01:46:24.469 --> 01:46:25.309]  It's already happened.
[01:46:25.891 --> 01:46:35.655]  And here's where I noticed it, and this story came across my radar on my podcast back in March, and I grabbed it and I went, I'm going to read this, and we need to pay attention to this.
[01:46:36.175 --> 01:46:39.897]  Schools in New Hampshire closed back in March.
[01:46:40.177 --> 01:46:45.699]  Entire districts closed for the entire week because their staff members were all giddy about getting the jab.
[01:46:46.079 --> 01:46:51.361]  And they all lined up to get it, and then hundreds of teachers were out sick from the initial reactions of the jab.
[01:46:51.441 --> 01:46:52.322]  I remember that!
[01:46:52.382 --> 01:46:53.162]  Yeah, that's right!
[01:46:54.025 --> 01:46:54.225]  Right.
[01:46:54.345 --> 01:46:55.786]  That doesn't mean the jab is working.
[01:46:56.066 --> 01:46:57.066]  It means it's poison.
[01:46:57.546 --> 01:47:03.789]  And that reaction that person has is a poison reaction that your immune system is saying, don't do this to me anymore.
[01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:07.090]  This is, this is how I'll make you feel if you keep doing this to me.
[01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:09.411]  They closed down their schools and I thought,
[01:47:11.283 --> 01:47:12.264]  What are they doing here?
[01:47:12.424 --> 01:47:13.524]  They're not paying attention.
[01:47:13.544 --> 01:47:17.105]  By the way, Doc, I know you're mainly an internet TV guy, which is great.
[01:47:17.205 --> 01:47:17.686]  So are we.
[01:47:18.166 --> 01:47:20.847]  But we have 200 affiliates, so we have to stop sometimes.
[01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:22.187]  Put it back on screen.
[01:47:22.527 --> 01:47:23.668]  Doctor's not making this up.
[01:47:23.728 --> 01:47:24.128]  Put it up.
[01:47:24.708 --> 01:47:26.229]  We got mainstream news here.
[01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:27.949]  That's WMUR9.
[01:47:28.209 --> 01:47:28.929]  Got a bunch of others.
[01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.350]  Some NH.
[01:47:30.490 --> 01:47:35.493]  Schools close Monday after teachers call in after receiving COVID-19 shots.
[01:47:35.793 --> 01:47:37.414]  And I saw that in Austin.
[01:47:37.914 --> 01:47:38.974]  I saw that in Dallas.
[01:47:39.014 --> 01:47:39.995]  I saw it in Seattle.
[01:47:40.395 --> 01:47:42.196]  Hundreds of articles I'd forgotten about.
[01:47:42.616 --> 01:47:44.037]  I'm glad Dr. Brooks brought that up.
[01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:47.358]  We'll come right back and talk about that on the other side.
[01:47:47.479 --> 01:47:47.819]  Wow.
[01:47:48.439 --> 01:47:48.759]  Wow.
[01:47:48.779 --> 01:47:49.760]  So he didn't make a prediction.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.800]  He said what already happened.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:51.801]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:52.701 --> 01:47:58.024]  Battling for a pro-human future against the eugenics depopulation is globalist.
[01:47:58.837 --> 01:47:59.357]  Welcome back.
[01:47:59.417 --> 01:48:00.558]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:48:00.698 --> 01:48:04.000]  Massive news has broken since we got our guest on.
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:04.961]  Let me mention some of it.
[01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:11.044]  We'll get his take on it, get back to the huge information he was just laying out.
[01:48:11.665 --> 01:48:13.266]  Adan Salazar has the article.
[01:48:13.326 --> 01:48:14.827]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:48:15.187 --> 01:48:17.929]  It links right to the Israeli government's own announcement.
[01:48:18.569 --> 01:48:21.631]  Remember, Israel and Australia are the cutting edge of what's coming here next.
[01:48:22.371 --> 01:48:24.893]  Israel to grant green passports to
[01:48:26.072 --> 01:48:29.193]  Fly and travel and go in restaurants.
[01:48:30.273 --> 01:48:35.814]  Israel to grant green passports only to triple vaccinated.
[01:48:35.834 --> 01:48:37.275]  That's how it works.
[01:48:37.515 --> 01:48:38.735]  Oh, maybe the vaccine working.
[01:48:38.855 --> 01:48:41.496]  Oh, you got to take a third one recommended.
[01:48:41.656 --> 01:48:43.296]  Oh, now you've got to take it.
[01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:45.677]  And then a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a 10th and a 20th.
[01:48:47.114 --> 01:48:47.674]  Unbelievable.
[01:48:48.435 --> 01:48:48.815]  Study.
[01:48:48.875 --> 01:48:50.677]  Why are so many vaccinated people getting sick?
[01:48:51.077 --> 01:48:52.558]  Antibody-dependent enhancement.
[01:48:53.078 --> 01:48:55.060]  We'll talk about that with our guests in a minute, but look at this.
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.420]  Pfizer shot.
[01:48:56.881 --> 01:49:01.744]  Just 39% effective against Delta infection, which is the majority of infections.
[01:49:02.144 --> 01:49:02.705]  Forbes.
[01:49:03.145 --> 01:49:05.327]  That's their excuse to get around the fact it doesn't work.
[01:49:06.027 --> 01:49:09.128]  Bloomberg says, oh, looks like people get even sicker to have the vaccine.
[01:49:09.408 --> 01:49:10.548]  The answer, more vaccines.
[01:49:10.608 --> 01:49:11.508]  And now this today.
[01:49:11.528 --> 01:49:15.830]  Pfizer's CEO, same guy says he won't take it, says he doesn't need to.
[01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:16.670]  I'm not kidding.
[01:49:16.690 --> 01:49:17.350]  I have a clip of it.
[01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:22.231]  Says COVID-19 vaccine resistant variant likely to emerge.
[01:49:22.291 --> 01:49:25.272]  So he tells you after the fact his cover story.
[01:49:27.281 --> 01:49:40.244]  So I guess their stock stays up, which of course it will stay up because it's all based on a giant fraud of making you take more all the time as it destroys your immune system and renders you basically totally dependent on them.
[01:49:40.584 --> 01:49:41.184]  And here it is.
[01:49:41.504 --> 01:49:47.245]  Vaccines could drive the evolution of more COVID-19 mutants, which it did in PR.
[01:49:47.965 --> 01:49:49.786]  And it goes on from there.
[01:49:49.866 --> 01:49:50.986]  And our guests mentioned this.
[01:49:51.986 --> 01:49:52.867]  Let's back him up.
[01:49:52.927 --> 01:49:54.348]  I'd forgotten about this.
[01:49:55.068 --> 01:49:56.649]  This is out of the Concord Monitor.
[01:49:56.969 --> 01:49:58.851]  Newly vaccinated teachers report side effects.
[01:49:59.191 --> 01:50:00.912]  Schools closed because so many were ill.
[01:50:01.693 --> 01:50:07.917]  Some New Hampshire schools closed after vaccinated teachers call in sick after receiving their shots.
[01:50:09.098 --> 01:50:09.838]  Emergency.
[01:50:10.038 --> 01:50:14.862]  The FDA now calls more and more drugs not just dangerous, but they give death warnings.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:25.445]  All right, going back to Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., who spoke out at his alma mater there in Ohio and went viral.
[01:50:26.225 --> 01:50:33.429]  You had left off there with warning the schools are going to be crippled, everything's going to be crippled by this, and that being the plan.
[01:50:33.809 --> 01:50:34.589]  Continue with that.
[01:50:34.649 --> 01:50:38.851]  Would you like to comment on what we knew was coming that, oh, guess what?
[01:50:39.372 --> 01:50:42.493]  There'll be monthly shots, basically, with your new vaccine passports.
[01:50:45.415 --> 01:50:45.795]  Yeah, that's...
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:47.881]  It's not surprising.
[01:50:48.201 --> 01:51:08.978]  I mean this was written about and spoken about over a year ago and you know I again back in March I tossed up an article for the first time on American Thinker and they accepted it and I said homeschooling is going to dramatically increase here in the future and there cannot be a bigger green flag for families to run
[01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:12.664]  toward homeschooling and find these outlets.
[01:51:12.704 --> 01:51:19.705]  And just very quickly I'd like to mention a few because again homeschooling and hating on homeschooling is pure propaganda.
[01:51:20.305 --> 01:51:21.506]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:51:21.566 --> 01:51:28.227]  It's designed to keep people attached to the K-12 environment and not have a free mind and think for themselves.
[01:51:28.527 --> 01:51:32.708]  So I'm not a paid spokesperson for these websites but there's two of them that I recommend.
[01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:34.869]  Abeca.com is one of them.
[01:51:35.618 --> 01:51:38.240]  And CalvertEducation.com is another.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:40.441]  I highly recommend people look into these.
[01:51:40.822 --> 01:51:42.022]  I've had guests on my show.
[01:51:42.042 --> 01:51:43.684]  We're going to see a giant exodus.
[01:51:43.724 --> 01:51:45.925]  The whole future is going to be freedom.
[01:51:45.945 --> 01:51:51.889]  The whole future is people are going to figure out building our own civilization, our own society, and people need to start striking out now.
[01:51:54.011 --> 01:51:58.254]  Yeah, and it's the K-12 environments, of course, that are doing it themselves.
[01:51:58.874 --> 01:52:03.077]  They're destroying their own environment and they don't seem to know nor care.
[01:52:04.048 --> 01:52:06.909]  And they're taking a lot of good people with them, which is a shame.
[01:52:07.069 --> 01:52:13.610]  There's a lot of great non-teaching staff that work in these buildings that have their heads on straight and they're seeing what's happening and they don't like it.
[01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:16.711]  And I have always advocated for those individuals as well.
[01:52:17.071 --> 01:52:18.491]  The same thing is true with teachers.
[01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:20.311]  There are some teachers that are awake.
[01:52:20.771 --> 01:52:21.672]  They're fully awake.
[01:52:22.132 --> 01:52:24.332]  And then there are others that are just blind to all of it.
[01:52:24.852 --> 01:52:30.813]  And again, you know, everybody saw the clip of the Utah teacher who got fired for popping off in her classroom.
[01:52:31.153 --> 01:52:33.674]  Everything she said is a fireable offense.
[01:52:34.392 --> 01:52:47.505]  And everything that they're doing, and this is big, everything that all of these school boards and administrators and school teachers have done over the last year now, unless they've rewritten their contracts to allow child abuse.
[01:52:48.001 --> 01:52:54.085]  Or they've rewritten the terms of their, you know, the terms of their agreements to include all of this abuse.
[01:52:54.526 --> 01:52:57.608]  If this were done back in 2019, they'd all be fired.
[01:52:58.188 --> 01:53:00.330]  And I know the process of how that all works.
[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:02.171]  They'd be placed on administrative leave.
[01:53:02.632 --> 01:53:09.917]  If they were to walk into a classroom, see shower curtains hanging up in between people's desks, wearing masks, they would say, what are you doing?
[01:53:10.137 --> 01:53:15.881]  Well, Texas law says making a child wear a mask is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.
[01:53:16.181 --> 01:53:19.784]  You can't make prisoners do that unless they've attacked people or whatever.
[01:53:19.824 --> 01:53:21.285]  So, yeah, this is all illegal.
[01:53:22.506 --> 01:53:23.046]  Completely.
[01:53:23.987 --> 01:53:25.788]  And it's being sanctioned and it's 100% allowed.
[01:53:25.808 --> 01:53:29.371]  Have you seen the schools in Georgia where they can't talk if they're expelled?
[01:53:29.851 --> 01:53:31.773]  So now they say don't look at each other or talk.
[01:53:32.133 --> 01:53:34.475]  It's like cult members where they walk around not even talking.
[01:53:37.829 --> 01:53:39.270]  I haven't, but I don't doubt it.
[01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:42.712]  And the imagery alone should shake anybody to the core.
[01:53:43.253 --> 01:53:51.758]  The second that I started to see that, I thought, they've crossed the bridge, they've crossed the line, and they're not going to go back to anything else anymore.
[01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:53.499]  They've played their hand.
[01:53:53.939 --> 01:53:57.301]  They've shown everyone what an abusive environment they are.
[01:53:57.681 --> 01:53:58.962]  Now, is it happening everywhere?
[01:53:59.062 --> 01:53:59.302]  No.
[01:53:59.462 --> 01:54:05.406]  There are private schools that are shielding their students and their staff from everything that's going on, and God bless them.
[01:54:05.834 --> 01:54:09.878]  We also know that there are private schools that are demanding everybody get jabbed.
[01:54:09.958 --> 01:54:13.381]  There was a Tennessee school that did that a few months ago.
[01:54:13.401 --> 01:54:16.244]  I brought that up on my podcast.
[01:54:16.304 --> 01:54:18.305]  I played the guy's audio who runs the school.
[01:54:18.486 --> 01:54:19.887]  I mean, he sounded not well.
[01:54:20.948 --> 01:54:22.229]  And these people aren't well.
[01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:24.291]  These are all abusive tactics.
[01:54:24.912 --> 01:54:26.293]  They're all being normalized.
[01:54:26.806 --> 01:54:37.069]  And it's being normalized generationally, of course, as many of us know, for the sole purpose of creating a generation of people that can easily be controlled down the line if the jabs don't get them first.
[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:41.150]  So... How do we fight back against this?
[01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:45.972]  Obviously get people out of school, sue the school, say no, go speak at school board meetings.
[01:54:46.812 --> 01:54:48.552]  I mean, what do we do?
[01:54:48.572 --> 01:54:50.633]  Because it's just all out in the open now.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.401]  I don't think that speaking at school board meetings is going to do the trick anymore.
[01:54:57.261 --> 01:54:59.382]  I've commented on that on my podcast.
[01:54:59.482 --> 01:55:05.443]  I'm not saying it does the trick, but people like school boards, city councils, those go viral.
[01:55:05.783 --> 01:55:10.464]  So if somebody gets 100,000 views, not just what's seen locally, that helps others.
[01:55:10.544 --> 01:55:14.585]  I think this is one of the few venues, actually, where media is getting out to a larger group.
[01:55:14.885 --> 01:55:17.625]  I get you're saying it doesn't help the school board because they're arrogant and don't care.
[01:55:17.645 --> 01:55:20.166]  But I'm saying as a venue to get it out, it's working.
[01:55:21.297 --> 01:55:25.280]  Yes, I'm certain it's waking people up, as it should, which is why I said what I said.
[01:55:25.661 --> 01:55:31.065]  They aren't thinking about what they're doing when it comes to putting their own staff members in harm's way.
[01:55:32.086 --> 01:55:40.233]  They've already abused children, and they've already tried to normalize that among parents, so much so that you have parents now abusing their own children and thinking that it's normal.
[01:55:40.713 --> 01:55:43.876]  And they're not calling it abuse, of course, they're saying it's under the guise of health.
[01:55:44.897 --> 01:55:46.018]  It's not helping them.
[01:55:46.579 --> 01:55:48.781]  There you go, like that imagery right there.
[01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:49.962]  I have that in my last book.
[01:55:50.222 --> 01:55:51.183]  That was insane.
[01:55:52.003 --> 01:55:56.867]  That imagery of those... This is what you would see in the most radical cults.
[01:55:57.608 --> 01:55:58.208]  That's right.
[01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:59.249]  It's nuts.
[01:55:59.749 --> 01:56:03.753]  And if a band teacher were doing that in 2019, they'd be fired.
[01:56:04.393 --> 01:56:12.139]  I watched a school teacher get fired for making students go to the bathroom while wearing a construction vest as a hall pass.
[01:56:13.629 --> 01:56:15.890]  They were fired like that, for doing that.
[01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:17.130]  But this is okay?
[01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:18.711]  No, it's not okay.
[01:56:19.351 --> 01:56:23.952]  The system is training us to be humiliated and dominated and controlled.
[01:56:25.393 --> 01:56:25.933]  Completely.
[01:56:26.333 --> 01:56:31.655]  And homeschooling parents and homeschooling students and families are laughing their tails off right now.
[01:56:31.975 --> 01:56:35.476]  But they're compassionate people too, and they're very sad with what's going on.
[01:56:36.216 --> 01:56:37.276]  And I'm certain that they are.
[01:56:37.296 --> 01:56:42.558]  Let's not make no mistake, once the globalists from the colleges have taken over all the schools, the public schools,
[01:56:42.978 --> 01:56:44.018]  They're going to come take over.
[01:56:44.038 --> 01:56:44.919]  They're coming for everybody.
[01:56:45.339 --> 01:56:47.580]  So people better know, this is a total takeover plan.
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:54.663]  So folks shouldn't be confident just because they live in the middle of Montana or Oklahoma and all your neighbors are awake and stuff.
[01:56:54.703 --> 01:56:57.484]  That's great, but believe me, the globalists are coming for you next.
[01:56:59.355 --> 01:57:05.377]  And the local city councils have their hooks in school boards, and they have their hooks in universities.
[01:57:05.597 --> 01:57:13.900]  Our local city council was upset that Miami University would not mandate the jabs for all of their staff and all of their students.
[01:57:14.261 --> 01:57:27.585]  And Miami University said, look, we're not going to do that, at least right now, but Miami University right now is mandating masks for everybody regardless of their quote unquote vaccine status, as are the vast majority of colleges in Ohio.
[01:57:27.605 --> 01:57:28.766]  That's a symbol of slavery.
[01:57:29.912 --> 01:57:31.134]  We are back live.
[01:57:31.794 --> 01:57:37.381]  Owen Stroyer is going to be popping in about 15 minutes to the next hour, and I've got a ton of news and information we haven't hit yet.
[01:57:37.401 --> 01:57:43.348]  We're going to be going over with him, including, did I call President Trump a dumbass?
[01:57:43.408 --> 01:57:46.071]  No, I said, I think Trump's really smart.
[01:57:46.572 --> 01:57:48.434]  Why is he saying that the vaccines work?
[01:57:49.502 --> 01:58:03.788]  Why is he saying he took it and it's great and if it doesn't work he'll tell us when I just showed you and it's been out for days that Pfizer says it's a 39% efficacy rate and now the head of Pfizer says oh new variants are here and his vaccine doesn't work but don't worry he's got new ones.
[01:58:05.869 --> 01:58:14.913]  And Trump had just said days before he said that in Alabama on Friday Trump had said it looks like a scam by Pfizer with these boosters.
[01:58:16.459 --> 01:58:17.660]  So I said, you're smart, Trump.
[01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:19.300]  I don't think you're dumb, but maybe you are.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.681]  Yeah, I stand by that.
[01:58:21.401 --> 01:58:22.202]  That's BS.
[01:58:22.282 --> 01:58:23.342]  It's not effective.
[01:58:23.842 --> 01:58:25.763]  If it lowers your immunity already, and it's now 39%.
[01:58:28.604 --> 01:58:31.286]  But the media spins it like, Jones leaving the sinking ship.
[01:58:31.826 --> 01:58:33.046]  Jones running for Trump.
[01:58:33.207 --> 01:58:36.028]  I've always criticized Trump when he's wrong.
[01:58:37.829 --> 01:58:39.769]  Not on some Trump cult bandwagon.
[01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:45.112]  I support President Trump as he stood up to China and defended our borders, and I think he means well, but
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:47.942]  He's also known to be pig-headed.
[01:58:49.664 --> 01:58:51.126]  And he got lied to.
[01:58:51.146 --> 01:58:52.769]  The sign is like, oh, this will fix it, sir.
[01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:55.152]  But it wasn't really a vaccine like they were saying.
[01:58:55.613 --> 01:58:56.775]  So he got conned.
[01:58:57.055 --> 01:58:58.217]  And he won't admit he's wrong.
[01:58:58.537 --> 01:59:01.241]  And so I'm going to go after him for it.
[01:59:01.862 --> 01:59:02.644]  That's the way it works.
[01:59:05.094 --> 01:59:08.016]  Let me get Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D.'
[01:59:07.996 --> 01:59:10.338]  's take on this, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[01:59:10.438 --> 01:59:21.627]  I know you're mainly focused on education and the great viral speech you gave, and it's all backed up by evidence, but how big a deal is this to have Pfizer say, okay, the vaccine doesn't work, but don't worry, I got new ones for you every month.
[01:59:22.027 --> 01:59:25.630]  I mean, you can see Bill Gates said this a year and a half ago, as you were saying earlier.
[01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:28.172]  This has been the business model all along.
[01:59:30.794 --> 01:59:33.176]  If people can't see the inconsistencies,
[01:59:34.816 --> 01:59:39.358]  I'm not sure that they can be helped, which is again why I said what I said.
[01:59:39.958 --> 01:59:41.718]  This was a room with individuals.
[01:59:41.798 --> 01:59:46.740]  The vast majority in that school board meeting were patriots, without a doubt.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.961]  They were all behind me and to my right, and they made up the majority of the room.
[01:59:51.821 --> 01:59:54.442]  And for the most part, they know what's going on.
[01:59:55.742 --> 01:59:59.684]  The message was for the school board members as a shot over the bow.
[02:00:01.602 --> 02:00:03.423]  Like that individual right there that you're showing.
[02:00:03.463 --> 02:00:06.065]  He was talking about how he's moving to Montana with his kids.
[02:00:06.105 --> 02:00:06.545]  He's out.
[02:00:06.605 --> 02:00:07.086]  He's done.
[02:00:08.406 --> 02:00:09.827]  And there were a lot of people like that.
[02:00:09.927 --> 02:00:10.888]  They said they've had enough.
[02:00:10.968 --> 02:00:13.610]  Another individual stood up in that board meeting after I spoke.
[02:00:14.110 --> 02:00:16.471]  And I went home after I spoke because I didn't want to get killed.
[02:00:16.872 --> 02:00:20.794]  But I went home after I spoke and I watched the entire thing from beginning to end.
[02:00:22.095 --> 02:00:26.378]  And another individual stood up and had the law in their hands.
[02:00:26.958 --> 02:00:28.099]  And they said, you're felons.
[02:00:28.839 --> 02:00:29.940]  You're all felons now.
[02:00:30.438 --> 02:00:37.021]  Because you've mandated the mask, and the mask in Ohio is considered a medical device, and this breaks countless laws.
[02:00:37.121 --> 02:00:38.061]  So now you're all felons.
[02:00:38.121 --> 02:00:39.542]  And it's in one ear and out the other.
[02:00:40.122 --> 02:00:46.465]  I mean, it's always going to be with most school board members, because that comes with the territory, and that's the personality type.
[02:00:46.925 --> 02:00:49.566]  They have orders, and they follow them.
[02:00:49.606 --> 02:00:54.508]  And those orders come from the top down, and they're all being squeezed, and they're all being paid.
[02:00:54.988 --> 02:00:56.589]  These are not independent school districts.
[02:00:56.909 --> 02:00:59.490]  How do we ever get back to them being independent school districts?
[02:01:01.271 --> 02:01:02.092]  You can.
[02:01:02.632 --> 02:01:06.615]  Well, even if they're independent, they're still receiving funds.
[02:01:06.635 --> 02:01:07.156]  No, no, I get it.
[02:01:07.236 --> 02:01:10.178]  They have independent in the name, but they're not independent.
[02:01:11.079 --> 02:01:11.959]  Right, that's correct.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:16.243]  And, you know, again, more pop-up charter schools would be a nice thing.
[02:01:16.283 --> 02:01:18.144]  Hillsdale College, I'll mention them.
[02:01:18.164 --> 02:01:25.190]  I'm not a paid spokesperson again, but if I didn't say it earlier, Hillsdale College has pop-up K-12 schools all over the United States.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:32.062]  And they're always interested in hearing from other individuals in other states and saying, hey, look, we've got a vacant building over here.
[02:01:32.463 --> 02:01:34.663]  We would love for you to come here and implement.
[02:01:34.703 --> 02:01:35.204]  Exactly.
[02:01:35.264 --> 02:01:38.265]  In fact, I have I have family who paid forever.
[02:01:38.285 --> 02:01:40.846]  This big Christian private school, it's like 80 years old.
[02:01:41.206 --> 02:01:45.808]  They ordered all the teachers to take shots and they want the kids over 12 to take it and everything.
[02:01:46.248 --> 02:01:48.629]  So half the school just left, pulled all their children out.
[02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:50.069]  They're just starting a whole new church school.
[02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:51.770]  I mean, the answer is innovation here.
[02:01:53.582 --> 02:01:54.222]  It really is.
[02:01:54.682 --> 02:02:00.403]  And again, a sound curriculum is not typically allowed in K-12 schools.
[02:02:00.683 --> 02:02:05.404]  They can pull the plug on BitChute in an instant.
[02:02:05.504 --> 02:02:07.445]  They can pull the plug on YouTube in an instant.
[02:02:07.545 --> 02:02:11.385]  And again, people watching YouTube at this point, I would say you're watching the wrong thing.
[02:02:13.326 --> 02:02:18.146]  They're suppressing the truth without a doubt, and they're a cog in the wheel, which is too bad.
[02:02:18.247 --> 02:02:18.587]  You're right.
[02:02:18.607 --> 02:02:20.587]  YouTube is the most censored platform now.
[02:02:21.502 --> 02:02:22.143]  No doubt about it.
[02:02:22.563 --> 02:02:28.468]  I mean, BitChute and Gab and Telegram and Band.Video, I mean, that's where it's at right now.
[02:02:28.488 --> 02:02:32.271]  And it has to be that way, and we have to do whatever we can to maintain that.
[02:02:32.591 --> 02:02:41.738]  But if a K-12 student is in an environment like that, and they're on their cell phone, and they're trying to look up that kind of information on those platforms, they'll get their cell phone snatched right out of their hands.
[02:02:42.119 --> 02:02:44.681]  If they do it on a computer, on a school-sanctioned computer,
[02:02:45.447 --> 02:02:49.250]  The internet servers at the district level pick that up and then they'll cut the line.
[02:02:49.350 --> 02:03:00.759]  Oh yeah, it's not just InfoWars, it's tens of thousands of sites, including The Intercept and Glenn Greenwald and people, are blocked in those databases created by Microsoft and others.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:03.841]  I completely agree with you.
[02:03:04.462 --> 02:03:05.462]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:03:07.046 --> 02:03:12.548]  As far as the school board meeting is concerned, the people in that room don't know about Dr. Zelenko for the most part.
[02:03:12.988 --> 02:03:16.449]  Again, the people who are patriots probably do.
[02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:19.630]  You know, the five docs on Rumble on the Critically Thinking Channel.
[02:03:19.650 --> 02:03:23.991]  These are the people that I pay attention to, I listen to, and I take in all of their information.
[02:03:24.591 --> 02:03:26.051]  Dr. Mike Yeadon, same thing.
[02:03:26.071 --> 02:03:33.253]  I could have name-dropped throughout the entire thing, but I had to cut to the chase because, again, I was limited in time.
[02:03:33.333 --> 02:03:35.594]  I showed up thinking I might have five minutes.
[02:03:36.274 --> 02:03:51.123]  I previously taped a guy who was given four and a half minutes in the last meeting in July, and I walked in, met some wonderful women in the back, some of which who worked for the district as non-teaching staff, and I said, how much time do I have?
[02:03:51.724 --> 02:04:00.249]  And they said, three minutes, but if you're kind to them up front, and you're just kind of running through the motions and you're speaking quickly, they might give you a little more time.
[02:04:00.269 --> 02:04:02.030]  Well, they gave me almost four minutes solid.
[02:04:02.857 --> 02:04:09.779]  Which was fine, but I had to cut, I mean, I had two pages of information I wanted to read off and I had to cut it at least in half.
[02:04:10.379 --> 02:04:18.501]  So I was getting down to brass tacks and once he said, you got 15 minutes, that's when I grabbed him by the lapels and I said, look, this has already happened.
[02:04:18.601 --> 02:04:19.302]  It's going to happen.
[02:04:19.342 --> 02:04:20.662]  You can't stop what's coming here.
[02:04:21.302 --> 02:04:22.963]  And, and here's the thing.
[02:04:23.763 --> 02:04:25.583]  They're going to lie about it in the future.
[02:04:25.683 --> 02:04:27.724]  And we know that they're going to say.
[02:04:28.598 --> 02:04:30.078]  We have teachers out who are sick.
[02:04:30.199 --> 02:04:31.239]  We need substitutes.
[02:04:31.339 --> 02:04:33.760]  They're never going to tell you why they're out sick.
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:35.640]  They're not going to say that.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.161]  If they say that, the cat's out of the bag then.
[02:04:38.681 --> 02:04:47.544]  Because we already see them lying about variants, and we see them lying and saying it's the unjabbed that are getting people sick.
[02:04:47.584 --> 02:04:48.544]  That's absurd.
[02:04:49.184 --> 02:04:52.505]  And the immune system, human immune system, does not operate that way.
[02:04:52.925 --> 02:04:56.427]  If you pump your body with poison, you will get sick.
[02:04:57.347 --> 02:04:57.787]  That's it.
[02:04:58.669 --> 02:05:25.583]  And the irony is that the K-12 environment, the same environment that taught us as minors to not believe peer pressure, to not take drugs, and to not believe peer pressure and take drugs from strangers, is the same environment now that is pushing this full bore down the throats of countless people, adults, children, and now they're all co-mingling in these environments as if nothing bad is going to happen.
[02:05:26.115 --> 02:05:27.816]  Again, I've said this on my podcast.
[02:05:28.156 --> 02:05:32.279]  You don't need a Ouija board, tea leaves, and chicken bones to figure this out.
[02:05:32.799 --> 02:05:40.704]  When cold and flu season rolls around, as even Dr. Zelenko said, you're talking about a ticking time bomb when it comes to a person's immune system.
[02:05:41.545 --> 02:05:42.925]  I mean, you just are.
[02:05:43.546 --> 02:05:45.947]  And Indiana University is another example.
[02:05:46.087 --> 02:05:52.932]  Over the summer, before summer, they said everybody who works here and everybody who comes here has to be jabbed.
[02:05:53.072 --> 02:05:53.732]  End of story.
[02:05:54.372 --> 02:05:55.133]  As you would expect.
[02:05:55.834 --> 02:05:59.338]  Countless students and parents started to sue Indiana University.
[02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:07.147]  A judge got involved, and if I'm not mistaken, the judge sided with Indiana University and said, they get to do what they want.
[02:06:08.433 --> 02:06:12.418]  I could have that wrong, but I think that's right as to how that ends up settling out.
[02:06:12.558 --> 02:06:15.542]  So everybody who attends now is jabbed.
[02:06:15.602 --> 02:06:16.002]  That's 100%.
[02:06:16.042 --> 02:06:17.184]  That's Amy Comey Merritt.
[02:06:17.504 --> 02:06:18.165]  All right, stay there.
[02:06:18.185 --> 02:06:19.066]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:06:19.086 --> 02:06:25.835]  And speaking of you wanting to be able to speak five minutes at that school board meeting where you're knocked out of the park, let's give you
[02:06:26.926 --> 02:06:30.929]  When we come back, this segment's only five, so we'll talk then with the next segment.
[02:06:31.309 --> 02:06:37.975]  I'm gonna just shut up for five minutes and you can give your full speech that you were unable to give on the other side.
[02:06:38.015 --> 02:06:39.476]  We really appreciate your perspective.
[02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:42.138]  Everything else, Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD.
[02:06:42.718 --> 02:06:44.500]  Okay, folks, we're gonna go to break here.
[02:06:45.794 --> 02:06:48.537]  Please don't forget, the way we stay on air is you buying products.
[02:06:48.897 --> 02:06:50.699]  We don't have big sponsors, we have you.
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:58.367]  InfowarStore.com has a big special, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion that's so good for your immune system and all your body's functions.
[02:06:58.387 --> 02:07:00.429]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals.
[02:07:01.090 --> 02:07:04.872]  And on top of that, it's got a bunch of key amino acids as well.
[02:07:05.332 --> 02:07:06.292]  It's back in stock.
[02:07:06.332 --> 02:07:07.533]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:08.093]  33% off.
[02:07:08.213 --> 02:07:15.276]  It's great for children, adults, and especially old folks, because a lot of vitamins and minerals are great, but they're in pill form, and some people don't absorb them good.
[02:07:15.617 --> 02:07:18.778]  This is liquid, so you get a much, much higher absorption rate.
[02:07:19.258 --> 02:07:21.319]  Vitamin Refusion, back in stock, 33% off.
[02:07:21.719 --> 02:07:29.423]  Living Defense has got a bunch of things like concentrated black walnut ovacs that flush out and detoxify your guts and get rid of unwanted visitors.
[02:07:30.023 --> 02:07:31.784]  Living Defense sold out for months back in stock.
[02:07:32.164 --> 02:07:34.026]  40% off Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:07:34.746 --> 02:07:39.109]  I could buy Krill Oil for 10% of the price I buy this, but it's crappy.
[02:07:39.429 --> 02:07:41.010]  This is the highest grade Krill Oil.
[02:07:41.391 --> 02:07:44.813]  So good for your heart, your liver, your brain, your arteries, your everything.
[02:07:44.833 --> 02:07:45.653]  40% off.
[02:07:45.974 --> 02:07:48.936]  Basil Beets creates nitrous oxide in the body, concentrated beet extract.
[02:07:49.336 --> 02:07:51.757]  It's 50% off and more.
[02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:53.639]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:07:53.659 --> 02:07:54.759]  That's what funds the operation.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:56.420]  We'll be right back.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:56.901]  Stay with us.
[02:07:59.096 --> 02:08:02.719]  Alright, we got this segment and a little bit of the next segment with Dr. Sean M. Brooks.
[02:08:02.739 --> 02:08:08.844]  He'll have the floor, like he's speaking at the local school board there in Ohio, hailing from Oxford, Ohio.
[02:08:09.624 --> 02:08:11.366]  In the next segment, then I got a bunch of news.
[02:08:11.406 --> 02:08:15.609]  Blitzkrieg with Owen Schroer in here before he takes over in those three hours of war himself.
[02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:21.274]  But Doc, just as a human, as a patriot, do you have hope with what's going on in the world?
[02:08:21.674 --> 02:08:24.196]  Because like you said, this is war, this is the big grand assault.
[02:08:24.216 --> 02:08:26.318]  I do.
[02:08:27.304 --> 02:08:41.472]  And I would consider everybody again, and this has been said before, so it's again, not a new thing, but I would consider people, um, I would, I would encourage them to think about their ancestors during this entire time.
[02:08:42.573 --> 02:08:44.214]  Our ancestors have passed on.
[02:08:44.374 --> 02:08:46.235]  They can see clearly what's going on.
[02:08:46.455 --> 02:08:49.717]  They didn't create us to just sit around and do nothing.
[02:08:50.838 --> 02:08:53.099]  And given the fact that this is a war.
[02:08:54.033 --> 02:09:00.455]  It's the responsibility of parents to shield their children from the bullets and the gunfire.
[02:09:01.135 --> 02:09:06.936]  They should show them what's going on, and many of them are, and God bless each and every one of them.
[02:09:07.416 --> 02:09:12.238]  But for the ones that are dead asleep, even them hearing this, it's not going to make a dent, maybe.
[02:09:12.358 --> 02:09:12.938]  I don't know.
[02:09:13.558 --> 02:09:21.020]  But they need to shield them from what's taking place, but at the same time educate them about what's taking place.
[02:09:21.827 --> 02:09:24.949]  And I think even Dr. Mike Yeadon said this as well.
[02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:30.113]  He was talking about, look, don't pay attention to your degrees.
[02:09:30.253 --> 02:09:35.897]  Don't pay attention to, well, I'm not going to get my high school diploma on time, quote unquote.
[02:09:36.698 --> 02:09:37.498]  That's gone.
[02:09:38.299 --> 02:09:40.060]  You have to throw that out the window.
[02:09:40.601 --> 02:09:43.543]  You can get a high school diploma anytime you want.
[02:09:44.618 --> 02:09:52.422]  Again, you can homeschool and you can... This is a civilization level design collapse in their own words.
[02:09:52.602 --> 02:09:53.042]  You're right.
[02:09:53.062 --> 02:09:54.283]  We're in the middle of a giant war.
[02:09:55.104 --> 02:09:56.644]  All that matters is winning this war right now.
[02:09:57.825 --> 02:09:58.305]  That's right.
[02:09:58.825 --> 02:10:00.346]  That's the way that I see it.
[02:10:00.466 --> 02:10:05.949]  Because again, there are too many people sending their own children into the slaughterhouse, so to speak.
[02:10:06.569 --> 02:10:11.632]  And as it's been said on your show, I'm sure a million times, by the time you smell the blood,
[02:10:12.378 --> 02:10:14.378]  of the sheep in front of you, it's too late.
[02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:18.599]  And again, it's gotten to the point now where, hey look, it's too late.
[02:10:18.879 --> 02:10:31.722]  Now I know it's not happening in every school across America, but goodness gracious, the vice is closing in here, and these private schools and charter schools that aren't doing this can only have so many students.
[02:10:31.742 --> 02:10:34.703]  I mean, they have a cap on their population.
[02:10:35.345 --> 02:10:37.187]  And then the next year, what do you think's going to happen?
[02:10:37.407 --> 02:10:42.412]  Are those students going to leave that school that's been a safe harbor during this entire time?
[02:10:42.492 --> 02:10:42.713]  No.
[02:10:43.253 --> 02:10:45.115]  They're going to continue to have those students.
[02:10:45.155 --> 02:10:48.558]  They might pick up some more in the grade level below them.
[02:10:48.578 --> 02:10:50.961]  And that will continue, which is a great thing.
[02:10:51.001 --> 02:10:53.103]  But those schools have to multiply.
[02:10:54.884 --> 02:11:00.709]  And mass non-compliance has consistently been said, and I completely agree with it.
[02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:03.891]  More people have to walk out of these schools permanently.
[02:11:04.212 --> 02:11:08.715]  It will shine a light on the school board, their actions, everything they're doing.
[02:11:08.996 --> 02:11:17.963]  And that's already happening, as well as, as you said, the colleges, hospitals, and the public schools, the primary schools, there's a giant exodus.
[02:11:18.023 --> 02:11:19.104]  How are they dealing with that?
[02:11:19.384 --> 02:11:21.446]  I guess the bureaucrats don't care because they're still getting their money?
[02:11:22.677 --> 02:11:23.837]  They've gotten their money for the year.
[02:11:23.937 --> 02:11:25.858]  The K-12 schools have gotten their money for the year.
[02:11:25.918 --> 02:11:28.679]  So the time to walk away is now and permanently.
[02:11:29.159 --> 02:11:30.180]  That's the way that I see it.
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:43.644]  Because if they leave now and only return in the spring and then say, well, we'll come back next fall when you've decided to not be totalitarians, which they're not going to do.
[02:11:43.944 --> 02:11:45.545]  The road has already been crossed there.
[02:11:45.985 --> 02:11:49.026]  So they have to leave and then stay away.
[02:11:49.781 --> 02:12:02.931]  And again, that's a difficult leap for someone and a parent in a family that's been in a pattern of behavior or had a pattern of behavior in their own mind for a very long time that the only way to achieve education... Sure, but folks have to get the social contracts broken.
[02:12:03.271 --> 02:12:04.692]  The more we submit it, the more it gets worse.
[02:12:05.013 --> 02:12:06.674]  Now we just have to pull out and say no.
[02:12:07.715 --> 02:12:08.195]  That's right.
[02:12:08.896 --> 02:12:14.360]  And online university, online college institutions have always been ahead of the curve.
[02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:15.274]  Always.
[02:12:15.614 --> 02:12:21.560]  You never would have caught me in a brick-and-mortar school building getting a PhD at a university, and I could have done it for free.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:26.765]  But I didn't want to do it because I've been through the system, so I have expectations.
[02:12:27.045 --> 02:12:29.968]  And if those expectations aren't met on day one, I'm out.
[02:12:30.449 --> 02:12:31.290]  And I would prefer
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:41.247]  As most people are finding out now, you mean I can learn at home, and the computer and learning at home, all of that stuff is propaganda as far as it being bad?
[02:12:41.428 --> 02:12:41.888]  It's not.
[02:12:42.168 --> 02:12:43.409]  Let the mind wander.
[02:12:43.729 --> 02:12:45.651]  Let the mind do what God wants you to do.
[02:12:45.671 --> 02:12:47.452]  Well, sir, you go to Mainline College, there's not even a professor there.
[02:12:47.472 --> 02:12:48.353]  It's just a bunch of zombies.
[02:12:48.373 --> 02:12:49.174]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:52.221]  All right, we got a jam-packed hour coming up here.
[02:12:52.242 --> 02:12:54.323]  Owen Schroeder joins me in a few minutes.
[02:12:54.783 --> 02:12:58.746]  Let out of federal jail yesterday for being at the Capitol.
[02:12:58.786 --> 02:13:02.368]  They didn't commit any crimes, wasn't violent, but they still call that a crime.
[02:13:02.848 --> 02:13:06.311]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, PhD, went super viral.
[02:13:06.391 --> 02:13:12.315]  One of the most viral clips coming out of these city council meetings and school board meetings, which everybody should be using as folks are watching these.
[02:13:12.795 --> 02:13:14.076]  It's getting out to a wider audience.
[02:13:14.096 --> 02:13:16.838]  It doesn't matter if the bureaucrats laugh at you, they'll cry later.
[02:13:17.458 --> 02:13:20.080]  But you said you thought you had five minutes, they've cut it down to three.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:26.064]  So you got the floor right now to re-give that speech and not be interrupted, not be told 15 seconds.
[02:13:26.504 --> 02:13:32.048]  So you give us the next speech from Dr. Sean M. Brooks, AmericanEducationFM.com.
[02:13:33.869 --> 02:13:34.569]  I appreciate it.
[02:13:34.609 --> 02:13:39.132]  I'm not sure I could repeat it, but I'll certainly bring up a few points that are worth bringing up.
[02:13:40.093 --> 02:13:42.334]  Number one, we all know about the faulty tests.
[02:13:42.815 --> 02:13:46.097]  They're using these faulty tests and they're testing students
[02:13:47.011 --> 02:13:54.797]  Consistently, as they come in, temperature checks, X, Y, Z. All of this is an invasion.
[02:13:55.077 --> 02:13:56.558]  All of this is child abuse.
[02:13:56.798 --> 02:14:01.001]  And people need to, again, they've got to wrap their arms around this.
[02:14:01.101 --> 02:14:02.582]  It's not under the guise of health.
[02:14:02.662 --> 02:14:03.523]  It never has been.
[02:14:03.623 --> 02:14:04.584]  It's child abuse.
[02:14:04.804 --> 02:14:06.125]  That's number one.
[02:14:06.625 --> 02:14:12.029]  Number two, they're using those faulty tests to quarantine students.
[02:14:12.089 --> 02:14:13.250]  They use a faulty test.
[02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:14.291]  They test positive.
[02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:15.732]  They throw them in a
[02:14:16.511 --> 02:14:21.654]  Isolated room by themselves somewhere, which I don't know how schools can accommodate for that.
[02:14:22.295 --> 02:14:25.317]  And then they're calling home and they're saying, well, they tested positive.
[02:14:25.337 --> 02:14:26.558]  You need to come and pick them up.
[02:14:27.338 --> 02:14:29.540]  And then they come and pick them up.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:35.984]  So the parents are being yanked around by a leash regarding all of this on a consistent basis.
[02:14:36.564 --> 02:14:43.589]  It baffles the mind as to why a parent would continue to send their child to an environment that's engaging in such practices.
[02:14:44.926 --> 02:14:47.869]  I would encourage people to look up Ohio House Bill 248.
[02:14:48.289 --> 02:14:56.676]  That's currently being discussed, I believe, on the House floor in Ohio, and it has to do with vaccine rights.
[02:14:56.856 --> 02:15:01.079]  No passports, no mandates, no jabs, right across the board.
[02:15:01.579 --> 02:15:08.725]  I believe it also includes all vaccines so that schools can't in the future say, well, they have to have this and they have to have that.
[02:15:09.315 --> 02:15:19.983]  This notion that the unvaxxed or the unjabbed would ever make someone ill in a K-12 environment who's taken all of these drugs and these poisons is absurd.
[02:15:20.803 --> 02:15:24.966]  It defies logic as to why that would even be the case.
[02:15:25.587 --> 02:15:30.430]  So, again, the quarantining is beyond alarming.
[02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:36.495]  The moment that, you know, I don't have children, but if at the moment that I had heard that
[02:15:37.282 --> 02:15:40.684]  And that being done to one of my own children, that would have been the last straw.
[02:15:41.104 --> 02:15:41.845]  That would have been it.
[02:15:42.385 --> 02:15:44.787]  I would have immediately started to research homeschooling.
[02:15:44.947 --> 02:15:49.610]  And again, countless parents throughout the United States and around the world have done just that.
[02:15:50.070 --> 02:16:02.397]  I would also take it a step further and go back to, again, what Dr. Mike Eden said, which is you've got to completely shake up your notion of the pragmatic way that things have been done in the past.
[02:16:02.898 --> 02:16:03.938]  It didn't work then.
[02:16:03.958 --> 02:16:06.720]  And we're in war now, which means
[02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:10.192]  Things are not going to be the same, nor should they.
[02:16:10.632 --> 02:16:22.418]  We're evolving to the point where we can become more independent and stop being so reliant on government and the people around us to make our education decisions for us.
[02:16:22.839 --> 02:16:29.262]  We've always known that the Rockefellers and the Carnegies have had everything to do with the K-12 textbook system.
[02:16:29.742 --> 02:16:30.883]  No different in higher ed.
[02:16:31.223 --> 02:16:32.184]  It's the exact same.
[02:16:32.944 --> 02:16:34.385]  They control the information.
[02:16:35.745 --> 02:16:38.926]  They control the minds of those individuals that don't think for themselves.
[02:16:39.327 --> 02:16:44.889]  And again, when I was in college, the books I read were the ones that I went to the bookstore to buy.
[02:16:45.209 --> 02:16:49.591]  They were not the ones that the university said, well, you need to read this, and you need to read that.
[02:16:50.011 --> 02:16:54.173]  I'd look at this $300 textbook and say, no, I'm not reading this.
[02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:58.234]  And I'd glance through it, I'd write a paper for the class, and then that'd be it.
[02:16:58.834 --> 02:16:59.995]  And then I'd go to a bookstore.
[02:17:03.595 --> 02:17:05.236]  Well, for those that don't know, Doc...
[02:17:19.802 --> 02:17:25.745]  Up until really the 1850s and stuff, most colleges, you had to come exam to even get in them.
[02:17:26.086 --> 02:17:27.967]  People were self-taught or they apprenticed.
[02:17:28.027 --> 02:17:32.429]  Most lawyers, like Andrew Jackson and others, they just went and apprenticed for two years.
[02:17:32.889 --> 02:17:34.130]  One guy might have to apprentice for ten.
[02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:35.411]  They maybe never got him a law license.
[02:17:35.431 --> 02:17:35.891]  He wasn't good.
[02:17:36.371 --> 02:17:37.972]  Jackson, they said, in two years, you got it.
[02:17:38.172 --> 02:17:40.733]  He was like a judge a few years later because he was competent.
[02:17:41.053 --> 02:17:42.154]  It was the apprentice system.
[02:17:42.194 --> 02:17:43.134]  It was all self-taught.
[02:17:43.434 --> 02:17:45.675]  That's like Benjamin Franklin, one of the smartest guys in history.
[02:17:45.996 --> 02:17:54.219]  Never went to school anywhere, but the guy freaking got all the awards you could get in the world and professorships because he was self-taught and read books 10 hours a day.
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:56.560]  And there was no bell.
[02:17:57.721 --> 02:18:01.763]  There was no bell to tell people the learning stops for this subject right now.
[02:18:01.883 --> 02:18:02.543]  See you tomorrow.
[02:18:03.224 --> 02:18:03.944]  It didn't exist.
[02:18:04.608 --> 02:18:11.114]  The Prussian education system is the largest failure that's ever existed in the history of our country as far as education is concerned.
[02:18:11.695 --> 02:18:17.040]  For those that don't know, it was trained to create mindless soldiers and programmable people.
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:19.062]  That's the whole modern psychology came out of that.
[02:18:19.382 --> 02:18:20.664]  That is not the American system.
[02:18:21.721 --> 02:18:22.161]  Correct.
[02:18:22.301 --> 02:18:32.947]  And unfortunately, we have a great deal of individuals who have never taught a day in their life commenting on K-12 education haphazardly or just at the surface level without diving in a little bit deeper.
[02:18:33.307 --> 02:18:37.869]  Those same people, unfortunately, are the ones educating the future teachers of America.
[02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:41.830]  And that happens and has been happening now since, well, God knows when.
[02:18:42.290 --> 02:18:43.290]  A very long time.
[02:18:43.751 --> 02:18:45.231]  And that's also problematic.
[02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:51.653]  You know, they, I mean, I've been shut out of the higher ed institutions and it's not an accident.
[02:18:51.853 --> 02:18:53.173]  I've been writing about... Hey, but it doesn't matter.
[02:18:53.193 --> 02:18:56.494]  You're speaking up and you're out there now and you've written books and you're taking action.
[02:18:56.554 --> 02:18:59.295]  Dr. Sean M. Brooks, Ph.D., thank you so much.
[02:18:59.335 --> 02:19:04.116]  We really appreciate your time and great job on your viral interview or your viral speech.
[02:19:04.136 --> 02:19:05.717]  We want to see more of you and have you back on.
[02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:06.057]  Thank you.
[02:19:06.877 --> 02:19:07.357]  I appreciate it.
[02:19:07.377 --> 02:19:07.698]  Thank you.
[02:19:07.718 --> 02:19:08.538]  All right.
[02:19:08.578 --> 02:19:09.339]  That was powerful.
[02:19:10.579 --> 02:19:13.741]  Speaking of the young people waking up, I got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to.
[02:19:13.762 --> 02:19:15.983]  We're going to break them up with Owen's breaking news.
[02:19:16.803 --> 02:19:20.766]  UK kid on why he's not getting the so-called vaccine.
[02:19:20.786 --> 02:19:21.487]  This is powerful.
[02:19:21.527 --> 02:19:21.907]  Here it is.
[02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:27.751]  You're obviously aware of the adverse vaccine reactions, not everyone is, so you don't want to take the vaccine.
[02:19:28.532 --> 02:19:30.472]  What pressure have you had from friends or family?
[02:19:30.512 --> 02:19:36.074]  Because your particular age group have been targeted lately in terms of nightclubs, universities, going on holiday.
[02:19:36.614 --> 02:19:38.335]  So my auntie works for AstraZeneca.
[02:19:39.735 --> 02:19:42.616]  So the pressure from family, well some of my family, is
[02:19:43.676 --> 02:19:44.877]  Quite great to get the vaccine.
[02:19:44.897 --> 02:19:47.279]  They're quite, they're like, um, why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[02:19:47.319 --> 02:19:48.260]  Why haven't you taken the vaccine?
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:48.800]  You're selfish.
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:52.243]  My cousin's even called, well, my cousin from Cambridge has even called me a twat over it.
[02:19:52.763 --> 02:19:54.064]  Um, not getting the vaccine, you know.
[02:19:54.804 --> 02:19:58.627]  But I've, I've lost friends over it as well.
[02:19:59.048 --> 02:20:02.490]  There are some friends though who have, who won't take the vaccine no matter what.
[02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:05.512]  And that's because they've seen what it's done to people.
[02:20:05.713 --> 02:20:12.718]  Um, I've got friends who are very ill and haven't been, um, haven't been well since the day they took it and have regretted it.
[02:20:13.018 --> 02:20:16.900]  But I've also got friends who are like, well, if you don't take the vaccine, you're going to be killing other people.
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:21.222]  But if you can still get it when you've got the vaccine, how am I killing other people?
[02:20:21.443 --> 02:20:23.484]  It doesn't prevent transmission because you can still pass it on.
[02:20:23.864 --> 02:20:24.584]  You can still get it.
[02:20:24.944 --> 02:20:25.965]  So how am I killing other people?
[02:20:25.985 --> 02:20:26.645]  I'm not being selfish.
[02:20:26.705 --> 02:20:27.566]  It's my body, my choice.
[02:20:28.066 --> 02:20:29.347]  What's the world looking like for you?
[02:20:29.367 --> 02:20:36.671]  Because, you know, for the younger generations, if this vaccine passports are taken up by the majority, what do you think the world's going to look like in a year?
[02:20:39.244 --> 02:20:42.407]  In a year, I have no idea.
[02:20:42.547 --> 02:20:44.368]  It's straight out of the 1984 book.
[02:20:44.449 --> 02:20:54.277]  The idea that we're going to have to get out our phones and get up our passes, show our papers in the streets, or if we want to go into a pub.
[02:20:55.498 --> 02:20:55.918]  It's funny.
[02:20:56.098 --> 02:20:59.722]  It's honestly funny that people don't see where this is going.
[02:20:59.742 --> 02:21:01.023]  It's about control.
[02:21:05.066 --> 02:21:12.752]  If you allow the government to break the law and to violate your rights because of an emergency, what's stopping them from creating an emergency to break the law?
[02:21:14.213 --> 02:21:18.876]  Good old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon sense just genetically coming out of that young man.
[02:21:19.597 --> 02:21:26.422]  And that's why the system wants to discredit where all the modern freedoms came from, that little island, in the last thousand years.
[02:21:27.483 --> 02:21:35.648]  A lot of great people, a lot of great cultures, but the globalists want to get rid of the Anglo-Saxon idea of freedom because it flies in the face of everything else.
[02:21:35.728 --> 02:21:42.872]  And a lot of the people that, you know, are obsessed with hating Israel and Jews and all that, they're always like, well, there's no Judaic to the Christian.
[02:21:42.912 --> 02:21:43.952]  Well, there really is.
[02:21:43.992 --> 02:21:45.213]  That's what Christianity comes out of.
[02:21:45.593 --> 02:21:51.397]  You can look at bad parts of Judaism, bad parts of Christianity, more modern forms of it or whatever, the case of Judaism.
[02:21:53.153 --> 02:21:54.274]  That's a side issue.
[02:21:54.534 --> 02:22:05.042]  The Jews also did develop due process and some of the things that, when they actually ran into some of the Anglo-Saxon type laws that were already there, the Anglo-Saxons adopted it because it made sense to them.
[02:22:05.382 --> 02:22:06.723]  So they're very similar systems.
[02:22:07.524 --> 02:22:11.727]  And the globalists are getting rid of all of that right now.
[02:22:12.187 --> 02:22:13.228]  They're just trashing it.
[02:22:13.669 --> 02:22:17.912]  They're burning it with classic paganism, which just says, we'll kill whoever we want.
[02:22:17.932 --> 02:22:18.652]  We'll do whatever we want.
[02:22:18.692 --> 02:22:19.553]  We'll rule everyone.
[02:22:21.374 --> 02:22:22.135]  It's our right to do it.
[02:22:22.566 --> 02:22:25.489]  All right, Owen Schreier is out of jail, but he's got a hearing Thursday.
[02:22:25.949 --> 02:22:27.851]  The hanging judge might try to throw him back in.
[02:22:28.271 --> 02:22:29.772]  You've got big updates there.
[02:22:29.933 --> 02:22:31.434]  And did I really come out against Trump?
[02:22:31.794 --> 02:22:33.175]  I'll tell you about that when we come back.
[02:22:33.516 --> 02:22:34.256]  And so much more.
[02:22:34.296 --> 02:22:34.777]  Stay with us.
[02:22:35.578 --> 02:22:36.598]  Look at this headline.
[02:22:36.659 --> 02:22:38.200]  InfoWars.com.
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:42.404]  Israel to grant green passports only to triple vaccinated.
[02:22:42.924 --> 02:22:48.229]  The state of Israel may soon restrict travel within the country only to people who have received two vaccines.
[02:22:48.269 --> 02:22:49.010]  There aren't even vaccines.
[02:22:49.330 --> 02:22:54.155]  And a booster shot as deaths and infection rates amongst the fully vaccinated explodes.
[02:22:54.175 --> 02:22:57.278]  90 plus percent now in the hospital have had the shot.
[02:22:57.538 --> 02:22:58.679]  So it's not that it didn't work.
[02:22:58.799 --> 02:23:00.501]  It's no, you need more.
[02:23:01.001 --> 02:23:01.381]  That's right.
[02:23:01.441 --> 02:23:02.462]  If something doesn't work.
[02:23:03.183 --> 02:23:06.626]  If you poured gasoline on yourself and burned yourself, the answer is more gasoline.
[02:23:06.646 --> 02:23:10.129]  If you cut yourself and it hurt, the answer is cut yourself more.
[02:23:10.629 --> 02:23:16.014]  If you're fat because you eat too much, the answer is eat more, more, more, more.
[02:23:16.494 --> 02:23:17.455]  Owen Schroer is here.
[02:23:17.475 --> 02:23:18.936]  A video is out.
[02:23:19.397 --> 02:23:25.482]  Pfizer's CEO says COVID-19 vaccines resistant variant likely to emerge.
[02:23:26.002 --> 02:23:29.905]  It already has from the people that took the shot and now they admit
[02:23:30.959 --> 02:23:43.563]  Only a 90-something percent efficacy rate in our face, and Bloomberg tells the world, oh, you're going to have to take monthly shots that totally destroy your immune system.
[02:23:43.623 --> 02:23:46.003]  I mean, the logic is out the window.
[02:23:46.463 --> 02:23:47.524]  It was all premeditated.
[02:23:47.564 --> 02:23:49.124]  We called it over a year and a half ago.
[02:23:49.604 --> 02:23:51.405]  And, Owen, now here we are.
[02:23:51.445 --> 02:23:52.145]  What do you make of this?
[02:23:53.237 --> 02:23:55.039]  Well, there's a lot of analogies you could make.
[02:23:55.099 --> 02:23:58.724]  I mean, I guess this is a little more advanced.
[02:23:58.744 --> 02:24:03.110]  Like if you're in a sci-fi novel, like a movie, and somebody created some sort of a...
[02:24:04.099 --> 02:24:13.222]  A monster, human-eating monster that could procreate really fast, and then, oh well, you have to be a slave now because of this monster that procreates really fast and just eats humans and eats human flesh.
[02:24:13.622 --> 02:24:14.843]  Well, you say, who created this?
[02:24:14.883 --> 02:24:15.963]  Who released this on us?
[02:24:16.603 --> 02:24:18.484]  And you wouldn't then go to them for the answer.
[02:24:18.504 --> 02:24:22.125]  You wouldn't then go to them to say, hey, you know, tell me what to do now.
[02:24:22.145 --> 02:24:22.425]  That's right.
[02:24:22.445 --> 02:24:30.548]  The very people that cooked it up, released it, lied about it, and got caught, that make money out of it, who, by the way, said they want to depopulate us, are the ones running it.
[02:24:30.808 --> 02:24:41.972]  It's so frustrating to know all this Alex and you know what's sad is most people just don't have a clue and you're talking about highly educated people that are at the top echelon of their profession.
[02:24:41.992 --> 02:24:43.072]  They just can't believe there's predators.
[02:24:43.272 --> 02:24:52.535]  And they just can't believe that any of this is going on or they just don't pay attention they don't know and it's frustrating for us to just sit here be in the abyss stare into the abyss study the abyss but as follow-up for that
[02:24:53.075 --> 02:24:54.716]  Liberals even say they're willing to have death!
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.522]  Well, yeah, well, it's better that you die from a vaccine than you die from anything else.
[02:25:13.562 --> 02:25:14.682]  That's what the girls said.
[02:25:14.702 --> 02:25:16.003]  Both their parents died from the shots.
[02:25:16.023 --> 02:25:16.523]  Well, it's good.
[02:25:16.623 --> 02:25:24.907]  That's multiple examples now, but there's also a story that's going to be one of my main stories today, because this is kind of, I think the canary in the coal mine here has to be Israel.
[02:25:25.467 --> 02:25:34.153]  And guys, if you plug in, I don't know if you have the story on your desk, if you just plug in UltraVaxxed Israel, they're basically admitting now that it's all the vaccinated people that are sick.
[02:25:34.553 --> 02:25:38.836]  Israel is the most, as you just said, it's 90% of the hospitalizations are vaccinated people.
[02:25:39.036 --> 02:25:40.697]  Type it in, UltraVaxxed Israel.
[02:25:41.378 --> 02:25:46.061]  Israel is the most vaccinated nation on Earth, and it has the most COVID on Earth.
[02:25:46.101 --> 02:25:47.722]  There it is right there, UltraVaxxed Israel.
[02:25:47.762 --> 02:25:50.964]  And they said it, it's a warning, you better take more shots!
[02:25:51.364 --> 02:25:54.907]  They took the most shots, they're the most sick, so you need more!
[02:25:55.667 --> 02:25:58.309]  I can't put the clown world nature of this.
[02:25:58.789 --> 02:26:02.771]  It's like saying if I punched you in the face and it hurt, the answer is you go, hit me more.
[02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:04.912]  Like, oh, I'm bleeding.
[02:26:04.952 --> 02:26:05.892]  I need stitches now.
[02:26:06.072 --> 02:26:09.474]  Please, you know, you know, give me a brain hemorrhage, you know, crack my skull.
[02:26:10.075 --> 02:26:10.695]  I want more of it.
[02:26:10.735 --> 02:26:11.475]  I want death.
[02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:13.036]  How can this be?
[02:26:13.096 --> 02:26:14.177]  How can these people?
[02:26:15.197 --> 02:26:16.958]  Actually publish these stories.
[02:26:17.598 --> 02:26:19.679]  How can these people actually have this debate?
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:26.603]  But see Alex, that's the ultimate frustration is... Well, what is it where they publish stuff where the logic shows it's a fraud?
[02:26:27.731 --> 02:26:30.052]  I mean, but then still they just do it.
[02:26:30.452 --> 02:26:42.297]  There used to be this thing called debate, and we would have debates over major issues, and then people could be informed, and the public could make informed decisions, and we could have actually logical, reasonable discussions about this.
[02:26:42.337 --> 02:26:43.517]  You don't get to debate anymore.
[02:26:43.557 --> 02:26:48.579]  Instead, everybody's censored off the internet, including prestigious medical facilities that tell the truth.
[02:26:50.031 --> 02:27:05.398]  And you know it kind of in a way I think it goes back to what the doctor said and it kind of reminded me of something that I experienced growing up when I was a young professional how it's this new thing where everything has to be by the system for the system and anything outside of the system or not.
[02:27:05.458 --> 02:27:07.478]  And the system comes down from the Davos Group.
[02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:13.341]  The UN, the corporations say it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, it doesn't matter if it's bad, we just do it.
[02:27:13.801 --> 02:27:23.793]  I remember when I first got started in media, specifically at a company that owned a magazine and a talk radio station, and I was a writer at the time, so I thought, okay, maybe I would go that direction.
[02:27:24.234 --> 02:27:27.878]  Ended up getting involved in talk radio and just fell in love, never looked back.
[02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:32.104]  And I remember by the time I was two years in, by the time I was 22 years old,
[02:27:33.785 --> 02:27:36.067]  23 years old all the top radio hosts in st.
[02:27:36.087 --> 02:27:52.038]  Louis wanted me as their producer They wanted me as their fill-in host and I had to sit there and deal with Envy and jealousy and hatred from these guys that have been around 5 10 20 years that hated me Because I basically just left it, but it was the thing It was like look you're good at this and so that they said hey look you're the best at this I want you on the air.
[02:27:52.198 --> 02:28:02.905]  I want you being my producer It was never it was never like oh, I want to get all get one over these people It's just that's how it works like you were saying with them with what's-his-name Adams or was it Jackson?
[02:28:03.705 --> 02:28:06.446]  Basically was an apprentice for two years and they said, okay, you're a top lawyer.
[02:28:06.726 --> 02:28:07.927]  That was Andrew Jackson.
[02:28:07.967 --> 02:28:09.287]  Yeah, so I mean, that's what it is.
[02:28:09.347 --> 02:28:11.928]  It's just, hey, look, you want to win.
[02:28:11.948 --> 02:28:13.589]  I want to win.
[02:28:13.649 --> 02:28:14.429]  I want the best.
[02:28:14.509 --> 02:28:15.349]  I want the smartest.
[02:28:15.389 --> 02:28:16.950]  That's not a slight on people.
[02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:18.350]  That's just human nature.
[02:28:18.370 --> 02:28:19.411]  That's what made America.
[02:28:20.071 --> 02:28:24.333]  I mean, like, take Admiral Nimitz became the big top admiral and did a great job in World War II.
[02:28:24.733 --> 02:28:26.974]  He literally was never even in the Navy.
[02:28:27.014 --> 02:28:29.676]  The family was from Fredericksburg, but he did a great job.
[02:28:29.936 --> 02:28:33.578]  They advanced him, not because he was from an elite family, but because he was a really good seaman.
[02:28:34.278 --> 02:28:35.518]  But nowadays, that's not how it works.
[02:28:35.538 --> 02:28:38.260]  They just appoint all their kids and they're a bunch of idiots.
[02:28:39.008 --> 02:28:42.709]  And then, you know, as you've always said, the rising tide raises all ships.
[02:28:42.749 --> 02:28:45.790]  So you want, I've always been like you, I want to see other people successful.
[02:28:45.810 --> 02:28:46.590]  That brings me up.
[02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:48.351]  I'm like, yeah, like be successful.
[02:28:48.371 --> 02:28:49.751]  Hey, let me help you be successful.
[02:28:49.771 --> 02:28:51.052]  Then you can kind of pay it forward.
[02:28:51.432 --> 02:28:57.514]  But you know, there was a, there was a statement that came out of the state department today and they posted it on their social media.
[02:28:57.534 --> 02:28:59.795]  I don't know if anybody covered it as far as a news story.
[02:28:59.815 --> 02:29:00.535]  And they say, Oh,
[02:29:02.133 --> 02:29:14.859]  Diversity is America's strength, and it shows about all these different Olympic athletes, and there's Asian Americans, Black Americans, White Americans, Brown Americans, all this stuff, and they're like, see, this is why diversity's so good.
[02:29:15.419 --> 02:29:17.140]  And you're completely missing the picture.
[02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:18.681]  It's a complete swing and a miss.
[02:29:18.701 --> 02:29:19.741]  Like, not even close.
[02:29:19.781 --> 02:29:25.564]  Like, the curveball is in the dirt, like it bounced before the plate, and you swung for the fences, not even close.
[02:29:26.024 --> 02:29:28.305]  No, freedom is what did it!
[02:29:28.745 --> 02:29:33.367]  It has nothing to do with skin color, or race, or background.
[02:29:33.547 --> 02:29:34.867]  It's freedom!
[02:29:35.287 --> 02:29:36.708]  Freedom is our strength!
[02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:42.770]  That's why anybody of any skin color, of any whatever, can come here and be successful!
[02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:43.930]  It's freedom!
[02:29:44.470 --> 02:29:45.551]  It's freedom, Alex!
[02:29:45.631 --> 02:29:46.471]  It's freedom, America!
[02:29:46.531 --> 02:29:52.113]  Instead, they want to make it all what group you're in, so that you control the group leaders, and so you don't have an identity.
[02:29:52.473 --> 02:29:54.714]  You simply follow the identity they put out and they demand.
[02:29:55.234 --> 02:29:57.796]  So what do you make of what we thought?
[02:29:57.956 --> 02:30:00.398]  Oh sorry, there'll be new variants, you need monthly shots.
[02:30:01.018 --> 02:30:01.819]  We knew that was coming.
[02:30:03.325 --> 02:30:05.226]  It's just another element of the clown world, Alex.
[02:30:05.266 --> 02:30:07.007]  I mean, you cannot make sense of it.
[02:30:08.127 --> 02:30:09.267]  It's nonsensical.
[02:30:09.308 --> 02:30:12.809]  You just have to sit here and say, we're in the end times.
[02:30:13.289 --> 02:30:14.870]  The Bible warned us about this.
[02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:16.330]  I don't want to admit it.
[02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:18.431]  I don't want to think that hell is about to rain down.
[02:30:18.631 --> 02:30:22.973]  I don't want to think we're about to see an apocalypse here, but I mean, good Lord, the vaccines are killing people.
[02:30:22.993 --> 02:30:24.074]  They say it's safe and effective.
[02:30:24.234 --> 02:30:25.794]  They admit the vaccine isn't effective.
[02:30:25.814 --> 02:30:26.975]  They say you need to take three.
[02:30:27.475 --> 02:30:42.523]  They just announced today, I have the document on my desk, I'm going to cover it on The War Room, the FDA put out their document where they're saying, oh, we're approving the vaccines, just like we, I mean, I sat right here at this desk with Alex Jones a month ago, and we said in one month, they're going to mandate the vaccines because they know that the FDA approval is coming.
[02:30:42.683 --> 02:30:43.784]  Boom, just like that, it happened.
[02:30:44.084 --> 02:30:51.208]  But, oh, Alex, when do you think the FDA is going to be releasing their studies on these vaccines?
[02:30:51.968 --> 02:30:52.629]  Years from now.
[02:30:52.829 --> 02:30:53.469]  Years from now.
[02:30:53.509 --> 02:30:55.890]  In fact, I believe the earliest is 2023 through 2025.
[02:30:56.050 --> 02:30:58.912]  So they haven't done the trials.
[02:30:59.352 --> 02:31:01.113]  You're the trial right now.
[02:31:01.553 --> 02:31:05.155]  Tens of thousands of people are dying and they're not going to mandate this.
[02:31:05.175 --> 02:31:07.356]  It's all because they already secretly pre-tested it.
[02:31:07.416 --> 02:31:08.076]  It's a kill weapon.
[02:31:08.476 --> 02:31:10.858]  Let's come back and talk about Trump and a lot more.
[02:31:10.898 --> 02:31:11.398]  Stay with us.
[02:31:12.659 --> 02:31:14.700]  Well, there's the headline from RT.
[02:31:15.942 --> 02:31:19.784]  And it's in the London Telegraph, the BBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[02:31:20.545 --> 02:31:23.006]  It's in hundreds, if not thousands of publications.
[02:31:23.827 --> 02:31:31.711]  Frustrated Alex Jones calls Donald Trump a dumbass after he recommends taking COVID vaccines.
[02:31:31.751 --> 02:31:32.732]  Well, let's unpack that.
[02:31:33.092 --> 02:31:34.073]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:31:34.113 --> 02:31:35.173]  It's a gene therapy.
[02:31:36.214 --> 02:31:37.435]  It was never authorized.
[02:31:37.495 --> 02:31:40.216]  Now they've skipped the trials and criminally authorized it.
[02:31:42.017 --> 02:31:44.219]  And Trump says in the speech
[02:31:45.572 --> 02:31:47.293]  Where he was booed that it works.
[02:31:47.893 --> 02:31:50.614]  Well, I've got the article here out of Forbes.
[02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:54.516]  Pfizer's shot just says 39% effective.
[02:31:56.456 --> 02:32:03.559]  And here's the CEO of Pfizer saying, oh, it's not really effective, but don't worry, we have more shots that aren't effective.
[02:32:03.599 --> 02:32:04.820]  So here's the deal.
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:07.701]  I like Trump, the globalist one after him.
[02:32:08.241 --> 02:32:10.162]  He wanted to control the borders, wanted to stand up to China.
[02:32:11.121 --> 02:32:12.322]  But he can't admit when he's wrong.
[02:32:12.962 --> 02:32:14.863]  And so I said, is he evil?
[02:32:14.904 --> 02:32:15.904]  Does he know he's lying?
[02:32:15.924 --> 02:32:17.925]  I think he's smart.
[02:32:19.126 --> 02:32:20.407]  But maybe he is a dumbass.
[02:32:21.168 --> 02:32:25.350]  So I didn't call Trump a dumbass, and I'm not backtracking from what I said.
[02:32:25.731 --> 02:32:27.452]  The media just edits the quote.
[02:32:27.492 --> 02:32:29.553]  I said, I think he's really smart.
[02:32:30.554 --> 02:32:31.234]  So is he evil?
[02:32:31.394 --> 02:32:32.715]  Why would he lie to us like this?
[02:32:33.176 --> 02:32:34.657]  Or maybe he is just a dumbass.
[02:32:35.177 --> 02:32:36.278]  That's really a question, Owen.
[02:32:36.318 --> 02:32:37.819]  I'm not saying he's a dumbass.
[02:32:37.879 --> 02:32:39.480]  I'm saying this is a big problem.
[02:32:40.046 --> 02:32:44.609]  Well, and there's a image from that rally when he mentions the vaccine.
[02:32:44.649 --> 02:32:47.711]  And I think it's kind of powerful where he's like, oh, I got the vaccine.
[02:32:47.731 --> 02:32:51.153]  And when he reaches and grabs his arm, he kind of makes a pain face like this.
[02:32:51.834 --> 02:32:55.036]  And when you freeze frame it, to me, that image is very powerful because that's what it is.
[02:32:55.076 --> 02:32:58.118]  It's, uh, it's the globalist, uh, it's the globalist poison.
[02:32:58.178 --> 02:33:00.199]  It's the, uh, it's the medical tyranny.
[02:33:00.219 --> 02:33:02.001]  It's, oh, you know, like you're getting the pain.
[02:33:02.041 --> 02:33:02.921]  Like, yeah, this hurts.
[02:33:02.961 --> 02:33:04.803]  This medical tyranny hurts, man.
[02:33:04.863 --> 02:33:05.503]  It's not good.
[02:33:05.523 --> 02:33:07.484]  So I don't know if he maybe did that intentionally.
[02:33:07.504 --> 02:33:09.826]  I don't think, but I think that that was a powerful image from that.
[02:33:11.347 --> 02:33:19.212]  And it was definitely a dumbass move to promote it to his base that he should have known was not going to take that very well.
[02:33:19.712 --> 02:33:27.677]  And then you had Mike Pence and I think this really tells the story and maybe it's this political hubris but Mike Pence put out a statement.
[02:33:28.177 --> 02:33:35.641]  Basically talking about how great it is that the vaccines have been approved by the FDA, how great the vaccine operation warp speed has been.
[02:33:35.661 --> 02:33:38.563]  And then, of course, he takes credit for it with Trump.
[02:33:38.583 --> 02:33:39.984]  He says, yes, me and Trump did this.
[02:33:40.004 --> 02:33:41.225]  You can thank us, basically.
[02:33:41.985 --> 02:33:46.988]  And they don't understand that it's their very base that is the 50 percent that is refusing vaccine.
[02:33:47.188 --> 02:33:47.929]  Oh, but they do.
[02:33:48.769 --> 02:33:50.090]  This is an establishment move.
[02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:52.191]  Pence does it because he's an establishment guy.
[02:33:52.531 --> 02:33:56.334]  Trump does it because he's proud of it and thinks he's going to be blamed if it's wrong.
[02:33:57.102 --> 02:34:06.385]  And I think that there's still a little bit of... I mean, I gotta tell you, Alex, I'm not denying that immunization works.
[02:34:06.485 --> 02:34:08.105]  Natural immunity is the best.
[02:34:08.506 --> 02:34:11.907]  I'm not gonna deny that there's science behind vaccines.
[02:34:12.187 --> 02:34:13.747]  It's my personal choice not to get it.
[02:34:14.087 --> 02:34:23.270]  But I gotta tell you, I mean, seeing all the lies that they've told us about COVID, I mean, I'm looking back on all of this stuff and I'm like, maybe we should have never been afraid of any of it.
[02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:24.531]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:34:24.571 --> 02:34:25.151]  This is not...
[02:34:26.488 --> 02:34:30.591]  A classic inoculation, and all the problems with the former ones, and all the scandals.
[02:34:30.671 --> 02:34:32.913]  Act like it's just been some wondrous story.
[02:34:33.273 --> 02:34:34.914]  Guys, get the Brian Williams clip ready.
[02:34:35.094 --> 02:34:37.536]  I saw some TikTok video somebody sent me.
[02:34:37.596 --> 02:34:40.478]  It's got a bunch of weird stuff the kids put on there, but that's all.
[02:34:41.098 --> 02:34:44.301]  Brian Williams, who says he was shot down in a helicopter.
[02:34:44.621 --> 02:34:46.142]  The RPG hit it, they crashed.
[02:34:46.722 --> 02:34:47.663]  Nobody was shot at.
[02:34:47.763 --> 02:34:49.004]  No helicopters got shot at.
[02:34:49.124 --> 02:34:49.745]  It's a lie.
[02:34:50.385 --> 02:34:52.507]  Brian Williams is the NBC fact checker.
[02:34:53.007 --> 02:34:54.028]  That'd be like, again, having
[02:34:55.342 --> 02:34:57.363]  A convicted pedophile run your preschool.
[02:34:58.043 --> 02:35:00.705]  You know, it's the equivalent of having this guy as your fact checker.
[02:35:01.065 --> 02:35:02.405]  He brings up Sandy Hook.
[02:35:02.425 --> 02:35:04.606]  Like, oh, we talk about Sandy Hook so much.
[02:35:04.906 --> 02:35:08.148]  Something I talked about like 15 times, six, seven, eight years ago.
[02:35:08.208 --> 02:35:09.088]  The internet questioned it.
[02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:10.049]  I questioned it.
[02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:16.112]  And so they attach my identity to that and always go, oh, Jones said the mass shooting didn't happen.
[02:35:16.592 --> 02:35:17.832]  Well, was Smollett.
[02:35:20.094 --> 02:35:20.894]  Fake is hanging.
[02:35:21.374 --> 02:35:23.895]  Did they fake babies and incubators to start the Iraq War?
[02:35:25.256 --> 02:35:34.820]  Did ABC News show footage at the Knob Creek machine gun shootout and say it was people blowing up villages in Syria?
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:37.421]  The point is, yes, we all have a right to question things.
[02:35:37.701 --> 02:35:38.521]  That's our free speech.
[02:35:38.681 --> 02:35:42.803]  I've gotten a few things wrong, not on purpose, unlike Brian Williams.
[02:35:43.083 --> 02:35:45.604]  Did I ever get up there and say I was shot down in a helicopter?
[02:35:46.749 --> 02:35:49.211]  Did I say I was a hero that an RPG hit my helicopter?
[02:35:49.251 --> 02:35:49.571]  No, I didn't.
[02:35:50.091 --> 02:35:58.377]  So here he is, this criminal slimebag, sitting there gloating over, oh, Jones has attacked Trump.
[02:35:58.718 --> 02:36:05.122]  And then he acts like it's something new, that Roger Stone doesn't like Steve Bannon when Steve Bannon testified against him.
[02:36:05.162 --> 02:36:05.823]  I'm staying out of it.
[02:36:06.403 --> 02:36:07.424]  I like the work of Steve Bannon.
[02:36:07.444 --> 02:36:08.565]  I think he's a really smart guy.
[02:36:09.206 --> 02:36:10.948]  And I'm friends with Roger, too.
[02:36:10.988 --> 02:36:11.789]  I just want to stay out of it.
[02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:16.594]  But the point is, this is them gleefully, him closing out NBC News last night.
[02:36:17.662 --> 02:36:22.286]  Last thing before we go tonight, as someone put it on Twitter today, the rats are eating each other.
[02:36:22.346 --> 02:36:24.187]  Let's explain, and here's what we mean.
[02:36:24.447 --> 02:36:45.203]  Alex Jones, who sits at the very top of the conspiracy theory aristocracy in the United States, Alex Jones of Infowars, a platinum status anti-vaxxer, appears to have turned on Donald Trump, who this weekend, as we showed you in Alabama, gave the most cursory endorsement of the vaccine.
[02:36:47.475 --> 02:36:49.898]  They didn't create a vaccine, they created a frankenstein.
[02:36:49.918 --> 02:36:53.362]  And now they've got you signed up to it.
[02:36:54.143 --> 02:36:56.746]  Now the left's saying you better get out there and push it, and you are.
[02:36:56.986 --> 02:37:00.190]  CNN comes out and says, we need to see Trump come out and take the shots.
[02:37:00.430 --> 02:37:04.395]  And within weeks of them saying it over and over again, CNN snaps their fingers.
[02:37:05.325 --> 02:37:12.291]  Jeff Zucker snaps his fingers and Trump clicks his heels and hops up there at attention and says, how do you want me to jump, boss?
[02:37:12.671 --> 02:37:13.612]  Shame on you, Trump.
[02:37:14.433 --> 02:37:19.357]  Seriously, hey, if you don't have the good sense to save yourself and your political career, that's okay.
[02:37:19.377 --> 02:37:21.058]  At least you're going to get some good Republicans elected.
[02:37:21.599 --> 02:37:25.202]  And, you know, we like you, but my God, maybe you're not that bright.
[02:37:25.222 --> 02:37:26.483]  Maybe Trump's actually a dumbass.
[02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:41.276]  So, when you've lost Alex Jones, you've lost the man who said the parents of the dead children at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut were crisis actors, and that the whole thing was staged by the federal government.
[02:37:42.036 --> 02:37:45.678]  And quote the late Ron Popeil here, but wait, there's more.
[02:37:46.238 --> 02:37:49.339]  Roger Stone has turned on Steve Bannon.
[02:37:49.779 --> 02:37:51.660]  You might want to pull up a chair for this one.
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:38:03.043]  Roger Stone wrote this on Friday, complete with some typos that you'll see, and we quote, Robert Mueller informant and perjurer, Steve Bannon doesn't know his ass from his elbow.
[02:38:03.123 --> 02:38:07.065]  Steve didn't make money on Wall Street, nor did he make money in Hollywood.
[02:38:07.085 --> 02:38:13.767]  He's a grifter, a fat, ugly, inarticulate, poorly groomed alcoholic with delusions of grandeur.
[02:38:14.327 --> 02:38:22.895]  He has never elected anybody to any public office in his life, most particularly not Donald Trump, who is his own man and implemented his own strategy.
[02:38:23.376 --> 02:38:30.442]  Despite being an informant for Robert Mueller, they indicted him anyway, and he will soon be recharged in New York on new charges.
[02:38:30.503 --> 02:38:36.548]  You'll see me as his trial in the front row, and I will not leave until he is convicted and jailed.
[02:38:39.372 --> 02:38:41.753]  So there they are gleefully like we're fighting with each other.
[02:38:42.113 --> 02:38:43.553]  And here's the deal, we're not the cult.
[02:38:44.453 --> 02:38:44.973]  Exactly.
[02:38:45.253 --> 02:38:47.354]  We're free Americans that debate and have different ideas.
[02:38:47.634 --> 02:38:50.494]  Well, I was going to say, if anything, I think that that clip would make you look good.
[02:38:50.534 --> 02:38:52.135]  I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised by it.
[02:38:52.435 --> 02:38:57.136]  I think I counted just five or six blatant lies, Brian Williams.
[02:38:57.156 --> 02:38:58.876]  I mean, just flat out lies.
[02:38:59.176 --> 02:39:00.056]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:39:00.437 --> 02:39:06.278]  Like, you know, sometimes the crew will sit there and, you know, you'll go on a great rant or something, or I'll go on a great rant and say, hey, you know, that was good.
[02:39:06.318 --> 02:39:06.638]  Good job.
[02:39:06.658 --> 02:39:07.158]  That was powerful.
[02:39:07.538 --> 02:39:13.264]  Imagine the crew behind Brian Williams like, wow, this guy can just go on TV and lie like nobody's business.
[02:39:13.304 --> 02:39:15.626]  I mean, wow, he just went up there and just said a flat out lie.
[02:39:15.666 --> 02:39:16.947]  Like, hey, good job, Brian.
[02:39:17.328 --> 02:39:18.689]  Way to lie to the whole world.
[02:39:18.749 --> 02:39:19.530]  Like, that's impressive.
[02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:20.451]  What were a few of the lies?
[02:39:21.131 --> 02:39:21.472]  I don't know.
[02:39:21.512 --> 02:39:24.735]  I mean, everything he said pretty much was a complete lie.
[02:39:25.355 --> 02:39:27.538]  But again, how do they sit here and say,
[02:39:28.604 --> 02:39:29.545]  You're in a cult.
[02:39:29.625 --> 02:39:30.786]  You know, you're this, you're that.
[02:39:30.866 --> 02:39:32.627]  You're controlled by this, you're controlled by that.
[02:39:32.927 --> 02:39:35.049]  We just go with wherever reality goes.
[02:39:35.089 --> 02:39:36.530]  We just go wherever the truth goes.
[02:39:36.570 --> 02:39:37.931]  We just go wherever justice goes.
[02:39:38.131 --> 02:39:39.332]  If Trump is right, Trump is right.
[02:39:39.352 --> 02:39:40.453]  If Trump is wrong, Trump is wrong.
[02:39:40.633 --> 02:39:42.434]  If Bill Maher is right, Bill Maher is right!
[02:39:43.035 --> 02:39:44.996]  You know, we'll always give credit where credit is due.
[02:39:45.016 --> 02:39:48.079]  I think I got another video of somebody who I don't... Oh yeah, like Spike Lee!
[02:39:48.459 --> 02:39:48.899]  Spike Lee!
[02:39:49.019 --> 02:39:50.160]  I'm no fan of Spike Lee!
[02:39:50.561 --> 02:39:53.363]  I believe Spike Lee's a rich... But now he's gonna do 9-11's an inside job.
[02:39:53.763 --> 02:39:53.943]  Good!
[02:39:54.243 --> 02:39:55.003]  Good, Spike Lee!
[02:39:55.043 --> 02:39:56.464]  Expose 9-11, please!
[02:39:56.504 --> 02:39:59.525]  He's a day late and about 20 years short, but at least he's doing it.
[02:39:59.665 --> 02:40:00.425]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:40:00.445 --> 02:40:03.526]  Hey, if the guy's right, then the guy's right.
[02:40:03.566 --> 02:40:08.427]  I may not like him, I may not agree with him, barely ever, but hey, if he's going to... Good point.
[02:40:08.447 --> 02:40:09.887]  You can see that's what I was going to say today about it.
[02:40:10.227 --> 02:40:11.648]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:15.489]  Hollywood director Spike Lee says he had questions about investigation of 9-11 attacks.
[02:40:16.547 --> 02:40:17.868]  We're gonna come back in the final segment.
[02:40:17.948 --> 02:40:23.990]  Owen, you were given some rules not to talk with other January 6th people about what happened.
[02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:31.213]  I don't know how they do that when you're a talk show host, and I'm a talk show host, but it's all on document cam, it's all on body cam, it's all on video.
[02:40:31.873 --> 02:40:38.795]  So we're not talking about what happened on January 6th, getting our story straight here, when our story is just the truth.
[02:40:38.835 --> 02:40:41.576]  But I want to know how jail went yesterday and your court case.
[02:40:41.596 --> 02:40:42.597]  Folks want to know about that.
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.761]  So we'll discuss it all on the other side and a lot more.
[02:40:47.841 --> 02:40:48.942]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:40:50.742 --> 02:40:54.983]  Folks, I want to explain to everybody what the Havana Syndrome is.
[02:40:56.404 --> 02:41:00.305]  Because Kamala Harris has delayed her trip to Vietnam over it.
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:03.460]  You want me to pop in the first segment of your show to talk about this?
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:05.541]  Because we're out of time, or I can do it on my show tomorrow.
[02:41:05.981 --> 02:41:06.621]  Sure, come on in.
[02:41:06.641 --> 02:41:12.862]  Alright, your show's coming up in about 10 minutes at InfoWars.com, Ford's live show, and radio and TV stations everywhere.
[02:41:13.122 --> 02:41:28.965]  Yeah, it's kind of interesting, I'm not sure, I never... That's just like, let's show it, Pelosi, all the servants wear masks but none of the libs do, and then the really bizarre footage, we have the raw footage in a minute, we'll play it, of Schumer doing weird snake dances with Stephen Colbert, but go ahead, sorry.
[02:41:29.983 --> 02:41:31.984]  You know, this is really a perfect example, though.
[02:41:32.324 --> 02:41:37.206]  All of Pelosi's elites, all the Democrat elites, they don't have to wear a mask.
[02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:38.327]  They go to lunch.
[02:41:38.367 --> 02:41:39.127]  They go to dinner.
[02:41:39.187 --> 02:41:40.048]  They have parties.
[02:41:40.108 --> 02:41:40.768]  No masks.
[02:41:41.228 --> 02:41:42.989]  But, oh, the servers have to wear masks.
[02:41:43.029 --> 02:41:47.331]  The unwashed swine of society that's not the liberal progressive Democrat.
[02:41:47.351 --> 02:41:48.252]  They dominate you.
[02:41:48.512 --> 02:41:50.073]  This is the new caste system.
[02:41:50.093 --> 02:41:54.195]  We're building a new caste, American caste system, just like they built in Israel.
[02:41:54.735 --> 02:41:59.097]  And these liberal progressives and Democrats want to sit on top of it, telling you what to do.
[02:41:59.737 --> 02:42:00.498]  Telling you what to do with it.
[02:42:00.518 --> 02:42:03.219]  And they're gonna exercise the fraud that they don't wear the mask.
[02:42:03.479 --> 02:42:03.799]  But you do.
[02:42:03.899 --> 02:42:08.761]  Like Tucker Carlson showed San Francisco where they were shooting people in the street wouldn't wear a mask during the Spanish flu.
[02:42:08.781 --> 02:42:12.343]  They now admit 80% of the deaths were from the dirty bacterial pneumonia of the mask.
[02:42:12.643 --> 02:42:13.744]  They finally had a boxing match.
[02:42:13.764 --> 02:42:17.766]  There was a photo taken showing the mayor and the police chief and people not wearing masks.
[02:42:18.106 --> 02:42:20.587]  And that was enough nationwide to end the fake mask in 1918.
[02:42:20.627 --> 02:42:20.807]  Was that.
[02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:29.954]  Every day, I see violent crime happening on the streets of Chicago, violent crime happening on the streets of New York City, all these cities.
[02:42:30.154 --> 02:42:31.175]  Thousands dead a week!
[02:42:31.495 --> 02:42:36.458]  And I mean, it's like, I don't even really cover it because it's just every day, but it's like, hey, that's a real thing!
[02:42:36.478 --> 02:42:38.419]  It becomes this background noise.
[02:42:38.439 --> 02:42:39.580]  Can you guys roll Pelosi again?
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:43.042]  Somebody walking around the streets of San Francisco or New York, you never know.
[02:42:43.242 --> 02:42:44.463]  You can get your head bashed in.
[02:42:44.683 --> 02:42:47.105]  Some guy got stabbed like a dozen times in the face.
[02:42:47.125 --> 02:42:48.866]  I mean, shootings... Oh, let's just say it.
[02:42:49.166 --> 02:42:52.088]  Crime is up five-fold from just three years ago in blue cities.
[02:42:52.709 --> 02:42:54.790]  So if you're... I mean, Austin used to be a safe city.
[02:42:55.170 --> 02:42:56.011]  And I'm a tough guy.
[02:42:56.371 --> 02:43:00.694]  I will not go downtown now unless I have to at a meeting and I bring a bodyguard.
[02:43:01.174 --> 02:43:04.717]  I mean, it is literally like a lunatic asylum down there.
[02:43:04.897 --> 02:43:05.477]  Look at this, Alex.
[02:43:05.777 --> 02:43:09.480]  Seven killed, 39 others wounded in weekend gun violence in Chicago.
[02:43:11.141 --> 02:43:17.726]  Oh, they don't want to cover that because that just shows how Democrat-run cities are just completely falling into criminal hellholes.
[02:43:17.766 --> 02:43:19.548]  Which is the post-industrial plan.
[02:43:20.632 --> 02:43:29.057]  So it's all this panic over a virus, or over a mask, or over a vaccine, but then, oh, you know, you just walk out on the streets of a major city, you gotta watch out!
[02:43:29.158 --> 02:43:30.358]  You gotta have your head on a swivel!
[02:43:30.378 --> 02:43:32.660]  Alright, so Owen, let's talk about this for the time.
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:33.821]  People want to know about your case.
[02:43:34.761 --> 02:43:35.922]  What is it, DefendOwen.com?
[02:43:36.142 --> 02:43:37.843]  DefendOwen.com is the website.
[02:43:37.983 --> 02:43:41.606]  The support that has gone there, we've had over 3,000 donors.
[02:43:41.646 --> 02:43:43.307]  Last I checked, I think it was 3,200.
[02:43:43.727 --> 02:43:44.748]  It's just been incredible.
[02:43:44.808 --> 02:43:45.768]  It fills my heart.
[02:43:45.908 --> 02:43:47.329]  And this place isn't censoring us.
[02:43:47.409 --> 02:43:49.711]  Everybody doing crowdsourcing should use this place.
[02:43:50.111 --> 02:43:56.795]  Yeah, I was allowed to be on GoFundMe for like three hours, and then they canceled it, so we switched to GiveSendGo.
[02:43:56.875 --> 02:43:58.015]  It's been such a blessing.
[02:43:58.355 --> 02:44:00.637]  DefendOwen.com, we're almost to our goal.
[02:44:01.357 --> 02:44:03.498]  And, you know, this could be a long battle.
[02:44:03.618 --> 02:44:04.339]  I hope it's short.
[02:44:04.439 --> 02:44:10.442]  I hope we can take care of this quickly, and justice, you know, and my innocence will be proven here.
[02:44:10.982 --> 02:44:11.943]  Sure, let's be clear.
[02:44:11.963 --> 02:44:17.188]  I mean, I would have worked to get you the money for it, but I want to explain something to the viewers.
[02:44:17.208 --> 02:44:17.949]  We were in the red
[02:44:28.854 --> 02:44:31.556]  This year, until just a few months ago, then MyPillow came along.
[02:44:31.976 --> 02:44:35.057]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off.
[02:44:35.738 --> 02:44:37.699]  And that helped us get into the black sum.
[02:44:38.079 --> 02:44:41.341]  I gave the crew the first bonus in like seven, eight months, because they deserve a little bonus.
[02:44:41.721 --> 02:44:44.403]  That took half the extra money we had in the account.
[02:44:44.883 --> 02:44:54.949]  So when you start talking about all the Democratic lawsuits against us that we've defeated over 30 of them, almost 40 of them, we got a few left that you see in the news, and all the things we've paid out to stay on air and everything.
[02:44:55.909 --> 02:44:59.834]  It's a big deal to get lawyers to fly around in depositions and witnesses.
[02:44:59.894 --> 02:45:05.840]  I mean, to fight the feds in a case, they're going to spend themselves a million dollars trying to put Owen in jail.
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:13.488]  I mean, it's come out in news articles that some of the Democratic Party law firms that have been suing me have spent up to five million dollars per suit.
[02:45:14.486 --> 02:45:14.827]  I don't
[02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:36.214]  He said, pay them $15,000 or I'll basically rule against you.
[02:45:36.254 --> 02:45:37.735]  If this goes to trial, it'll cost millions.
[02:45:38.016 --> 02:45:39.897]  So I said, okay, I'll pay and settle.
[02:45:39.917 --> 02:45:43.140]  But I'd already spent a hundred and something thousand to beat their million plus.
[02:45:43.641 --> 02:45:52.850]  So I mean, folks, the entire Georgetown University has over a thousand lawyers suing us in Charlottesville saying we said stuff we didn't say.
[02:45:53.430 --> 02:45:54.031]  And that's coming up.
[02:45:54.051 --> 02:45:54.971]  That trial's coming up soon.
[02:45:54.991 --> 02:45:55.732]  That's the first one.
[02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:58.194]  So we are and we're not victims here.
[02:45:58.274 --> 02:45:58.954]  I asked for this.
[02:45:59.035 --> 02:45:59.615]  I stepped up.
[02:45:59.655 --> 02:46:00.816]  I'm ready to die if need be.
[02:46:00.836 --> 02:46:01.717]  I mean, whatever.
[02:46:01.837 --> 02:46:03.378]  I just want to be effective to the end.
[02:46:03.918 --> 02:46:05.920]  It takes money to do this.
[02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:09.663]  We're spending millions a quarter on just bandwidth.
[02:46:09.743 --> 02:46:10.283]  I'm spending
[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:31.015]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars just paying for shortwave globally and other satellites to service Africa and Asia and places where no money comes in, but we get the letters and hear the comments of African villages and people in Greece and, you know, people in Russia can see us on their satellites because we want minds, we want souls to wake up.
[02:46:31.436 --> 02:46:36.440]  And so you gotta understand, I got a lot of stuff going on, and in the old days when I could make money,
[02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:40.403]  I was funding so many groups and people behind the scenes.
[02:46:40.463 --> 02:46:44.027]  Now we don't fund a lot of folks behind the scenes because we're imploded down to who we are.
[02:46:44.367 --> 02:46:51.814]  But now our message is stronger, we've got more credibility than ever, people know we're dead on, and that's why keeping us on air is so essential.
[02:46:51.854 --> 02:46:57.059]  So go to InfoWarstore.com and get the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements.
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.341]  We've got mineral fusion back in stock.
[02:47:01.682 --> 02:47:01.902]  33% off.
[02:47:01.962 --> 02:47:06.944]  Get all the products there on the site because that's what funds us and keeps us on the year.
[02:47:07.024 --> 02:47:10.586]  And if I had a bigger war chest, we would be much more confident.
[02:47:11.186 --> 02:47:11.846]  I'm not complaining.
[02:47:11.906 --> 02:47:16.949]  I'm just saying I spend 30-40% of my time trying to make money to fund our operation.
[02:47:18.413 --> 02:47:28.379]  I'm trying to jack with my house to fix a few things in it so I can sell it, so I can get money to run this place, because I bought a bigger, nicer house because I knew banks weren't safe and I wanted to increase money to have funding in the future.
[02:47:28.399 --> 02:47:29.240]  It was done on purpose.
[02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:33.562]  But, I mean, I'm literally selling my house to fund this because you can see there's no future anyways.
[02:47:33.803 --> 02:47:38.666]  I'm just totally in, total commitment, everything, just want to win, don't want to bet my whole life on this and fail.
[02:47:39.286 --> 02:47:40.327]  Everything, everything, everything.
[02:47:40.707 --> 02:47:43.809]  So, go to InfoWarStore.com, get Ultimate Krill all back in stock.
[02:47:43.849 --> 02:47:44.349]  It's incredible.
[02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:49.493]  40% off Living Defense, 40% off Vasobee, 50% off whatever you do.
[02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:50.654]  Take action.
[02:47:50.734 --> 02:47:53.676]  Screwing around and not taking action is how the enemy's going to win.
[02:47:53.696 --> 02:47:59.140]  And you can buy better products and fund a liberty movement at the same time anywhere but here.
[02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:00.440]  This is the place to do it.
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:02.022]  And listen, Tucker Carlson
[02:48:03.266 --> 02:48:07.469]  He's a great guy, and he's awake, and he's kicking ass.
[02:48:07.509 --> 02:48:08.450]  He's a blessing from God.
[02:48:08.911 --> 02:48:09.971]  We're not in competition with him.
[02:48:10.212 --> 02:48:11.633]  And he does what he does better than we do.
[02:48:11.933 --> 02:48:15.195]  But with our reports, and our special reports, and what we do, it's something different.
[02:48:15.436 --> 02:48:17.797]  And it inspires not just him, but countless others.
[02:48:17.817 --> 02:48:21.460]  So you need to understand, folks, we are literally the armory of resistance.
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:25.463]  We are the intellectual cutting edge for foreign leaders and so many others.
[02:48:25.824 --> 02:48:29.526]  What we do here, our guests, you, this whole spirit is changing the world.
[02:48:30.327 --> 02:48:38.573]  Commit today to go to MFORWARSTORE.COM while you still can and get books and t-shirts and films to build our war chest during this critical time because the enemy's making their full move.
[02:48:38.693 --> 02:48:39.133]  Owen Troyer.
[02:48:39.593 --> 02:48:42.475]  This is the modern-day David versus Goliath.
[02:48:42.536 --> 02:48:44.577]  We don't have the purse of the government.
[02:48:44.637 --> 02:48:46.778]  We don't have the purse of the Democrat Party.
[02:48:47.239 --> 02:48:54.023]  We don't have billion-dollar corporations that fund our infrastructure and our crew and run ads on our network.
[02:48:54.124 --> 02:48:54.864]  No, we don't have any of that.
[02:48:54.904 --> 02:48:55.304]  We have you.
[02:48:55.424 --> 02:48:57.526]  We have you in the audience and we have us.
[02:48:57.946 --> 02:48:58.266]  It's us.
[02:48:59.147 --> 02:49:00.547]  Versus the entire salary.
[02:49:00.668 --> 02:49:02.608]  It's David versus Goliath.
[02:49:02.648 --> 02:49:02.948]  That's right.
[02:49:02.968 --> 02:49:04.129]  Your show's coming up now.
[02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:05.029]  You're coming on.
[02:49:05.189 --> 02:49:06.870]  And I'm going to come on about the Havana Syndrome.
[02:49:06.890 --> 02:49:07.930]  I'm going to solve the mystery.
[02:49:08.210 --> 02:49:09.210]  I'm going to solve the mystery.
[02:49:09.450 --> 02:49:10.431]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:49:10.471 --> 02:49:13.992]  The Havana Syndrome will be solved right now in the war room.
[02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:52.602]  Oh, we have some very, very, very, very, very exciting news.
[02:49:52.622 --> 02:49:56.864]  It's been sold out for months, and thank God the supply chain finally worked for a minute.
[02:49:56.944 --> 02:50:00.726]  We got a limited amount of the Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Mouthwash.
[02:50:00.786 --> 02:50:04.728]  With all the essential oils, such a great, clean, quality mouthwash gets back in stock.
[02:50:05.785 --> 02:50:13.134]  And we also have the toothpaste back in stock, activated charcoal toothpaste everybody wanted, natural fluoride free, gently cleanses teeth, fresh breath, enamel safe.
[02:50:13.194 --> 02:50:14.216]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:50:14.316 --> 02:50:15.117]  And real peppermint.
[02:50:15.217 --> 02:50:16.679]  It's available at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:50:16.699 --> 02:50:18.301]  We got a bunch of new t-shirts.
[02:50:18.441 --> 02:50:19.442]  Everybody likes t-shirts.
[02:50:19.482 --> 02:50:22.866]  They're sold all over Amazon, everywhere else with a bunch of my faces on them acting goofy.
[02:50:23.467 --> 02:50:25.308]  Got a nice black and white shirt came in with that.
[02:50:25.488 --> 02:50:28.170]  Got some new Trump 1 shirts that came in that are really good looking.
[02:50:28.210 --> 02:50:34.714]  And we've also got the liquid turmeric formula for 50% off back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:34.734 --> 02:50:40.397]  And you got four days left in the sale for the privacy pouches at 50% off of the 11 free bumper stickers.
[02:50:49.364 --> 02:50:52.849]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[02:50:53.189 --> 02:50:54.211]  I was overweight.
[02:50:54.351 --> 02:50:56.494]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[02:50:56.694 --> 02:50:58.316]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[02:50:58.637 --> 02:51:01.100]  And I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:03.864]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[02:51:04.304 --> 02:51:04.404]  Yeah.
[02:51:04.424 --> 02:51:05.485]  And it worked pretty good.
[02:51:05.646 --> 02:51:11.032]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with F2, you had, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[02:51:11.052 --> 02:51:11.612]  So I took it.
[02:51:11.712 --> 02:51:17.919]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[02:51:18.019 --> 02:51:19.401]  You know, I could think again.
[02:51:19.461 --> 02:51:21.183]  I could connect with people again.
[02:51:21.283 --> 02:51:27.628]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:51:27.648 --> 02:51:30.009]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:51:30.029 --> 02:51:31.851]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:51:31.931 --> 02:51:34.072]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:51:34.152 --> 02:51:34.733]  It's amazing.
[02:51:34.913 --> 02:51:35.253]  It works.
[02:51:35.433 --> 02:51:37.955]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:51:37.975 --> 02:51:43.959]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:51:44.179 --> 02:51:45.220]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:47.422]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:51:50.418 --> 02:51:51.679]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[02:51:52.359 --> 02:51:54.500]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[02:51:55.281 --> 02:51:55.841]  I know you do.
[02:51:55.881 --> 02:51:56.561]  That's why you're here.
[02:51:57.182 --> 02:52:07.307]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have great products that are self-funded.
[02:52:07.527 --> 02:52:15.792]  And that's InfoWarsTore.com with the supplements, the books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it, and Mike Lindell and MyPillow.com.

[02:52:28.210 --> 02:52:29.091]  The list goes on and on.
[02:52:29.251 --> 02:52:30.272]  Made right here in America.
[02:52:30.292 --> 02:52:30.713]  A 360 win.
