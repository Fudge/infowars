[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:06.391]  Remember, Obama knowingly placed tens of thousands of children with child traffickers, human smugglers.
[00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:08.392]  That's a Senate report, Washington Post.
[00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:08.852]  Just remember that.
[00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:09.952]  Now, that's from five years ago.
[00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:11.973]  Here is this new information.
[00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:17.655]  FBI waives background checks requiring for those housing unaccompanied minors.
[00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:24.077]  Oh, you're going to have to have domestic passports to go to a ball game, to get your hair cut, to go to a grocery store.
[00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:25.178]  You're going to have to have a face scan.
[00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:28.639]  You're going to have to have a QR code that activates your face scan.
[00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:36.136]  But oh, the border's gonna be wide open, and we're gonna have 168,000 people caught in the last month.
[00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:39.798]  Close to half of them underage children.
[00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:48.702]  And now, imagine who they didn't catch, and now we're just gonna give them, without any ID, any name, anything, process them through, maybe take a photo of them.
[00:00:50.649 --> 00:01:02.381]  On average, they're processing them every seven hours, and then just releasing them onto buses, just like under Obama, but on a scale, I don't know how many times bigger, but it is much, much bigger.
[00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.666]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:24.067]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:26.449]  You better believe you got one!
[00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:33.835]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:52.168 --> 00:02:01.151]  The Democrats want your guns if they are to transform our voting system into a means to seize the Senate with the rigged voting legislation of H.R. 1.
[00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:06.295]  This bill is an attempt to destroy democracy by federalizing aspects of U.S.
[00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.678]  elections constitutionally delegated to the states.
[00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:25.973]  It would prohibit common-sense voter ID rules, encourage ballot harvesting, require no-excuse absentee and early voting, permit felons and non-citizens to vote, and make colleges and universities trusted voter registration agencies.
[00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.014]  They'll need your guns if they are to turn D.C.
[00:02:29.054 --> 00:02:29.894]  into a fortress.
[00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:33.056]  This threat is very concerning for authorities.
[00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:33.936]  It's chatter.
[00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:39.078]  They will need the guns if they can no longer stop the media from exposing their agenda.
[00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:40.639]  Please give the media to the people.
[00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.001]  So you work for the commissioner, you're senior advisor, you were hired two weeks ago, and you're instructed to ask us to not have any pictures taken here.
[00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.502]  Please respect the people, the rules.
[00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:51.703]  Because the political leadership at DHS does not want the American people to know it.
[00:02:52.743 --> 00:02:55.865]  You keep standing in front of the pictures, so you don't want the pictures taken.
[00:02:56.205 --> 00:03:00.027]  The rules are arbitrary, and they're designed to keep the American people in the dark.
[00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:03.228]  I respect them, and I want to fix this situation.
[00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:07.330]  And the administration you're working for is responsible for these conditions.
[00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.811]  And I ask you to respect the people as well.
[00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.731]  This is not respect.
[00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:33.473]  Remove the filibusters to ram through anti-constitutional legislation favoring the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:47.300]  So governments must understand and balance national needs with the commitments made to Agenda 2030 to prevent development losses and stay on course on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.401]  They're gonna have to take our guns.
[00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:58.185]  And so after two mass shootings, Joe Biden is coming for the assault rifles as a means to declaw the public against his tyranny.
[00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:04.268]  As president, I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe.
[00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:17.095]  But isn't the overwhelming growing tyranny of lockdowns, the support for nationwide leftist violence and destruction, the Hollywood culture's embrace of immorality... The little Nas X!
[00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:20.776]  Mischief, collaboration, shoo.
[00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:22.277]  Hey, does anybody else?
[00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:22.697]  Sheesh.
[00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:29.840]  And the media lapdog divisive racist rhetoric actually fueling a wave of Generation Z carnage?
[00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:40.765]  All white people are racist, so... Recent reports of teenagers carjacking random citizens begs the question, where is society headed?
[00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.171]  She's stealing their car!
[00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.252]  They stole the car!
[00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:54.615]  They stole the car!
[00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:55.436]  These girls!
[00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:56.416]  That's it!
[00:04:56.456 --> 00:04:57.177]  That's it!
[00:04:57.477 --> 00:04:57.777]  That's it!
[00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:20.948]  This area has been plagued with violent carjackings and just in the last few months since the beginning of the year 23 juveniles have been arrested in the city in carjackings.
[00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:22.169]  It's got to stop.
[00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.738]  Brazen crime all perpetrated by a 16 year old girl who did plead guilty to aggravated robbery today in juvenile court.
[00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:35.881]  The 21-year-old Atlanta shooter was a sex addict struggling with his religious vows.
[00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:39.484]  He wasn't a white supremacist targeting Asian Americans.
[00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:44.286]  The Boulder, Colorado shooter was a crazed Middle Eastern-born leftist.
[00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:50.470]  But that didn't stop the media from running with the dangerous narrative, promoting a separate reality.
[00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.294]  And it is a barrage of false narratives and a lack of real leadership providing future generations
[00:05:57.634 --> 00:06:01.476]  With zero understanding of what is right and what is wrong.
[00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:02.897]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:07.439]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:08.740]  It's Monday, March 29th.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:19.926]  The year is 2021, and we are now inside the planetary world government takeover.
[00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:26.810]  If you thought things were crazy and out of control before, maybe you thought they were boring.
[00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:35.026]  Well, you need to hold on to your hat and strap yourselves in, because things are going to get a lot crazier a lot faster.
[00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:42.108]  The globalists have decided to accelerate the collapse of the planetary system, the human system.
[00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:44.969]  They know that there are cycles in human development.
[00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:55.272]  They believe that they are going to short-circuit a coming collapse early with a controlled collapse, leaving themselves on top and surviving the major cataclysms
[00:06:57.267 --> 00:07:01.170]  That every data point in history point to.
[00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.792]  They are trying to become God.
[00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:07.595]  They are trying to exercise God-like power on this planet.
[00:07:08.936 --> 00:07:12.539]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this Live Monday Transmission.
[00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:22.086]  Owen Schroyer and some more of our great crew are now, as we speak, getting down to the border to where you have seen the designed UN-directed
[00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:32.245]  Replacement chain migration taking place and things have gotten particularly in focus for us.
[00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:40.189]  So we'll have Owen Schroer later from on the border and in the Rio Grande on the very same boats that Senator Ted Cruz and others have been using.
[00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:41.650]  Very same boat service that
[00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:46.461]  You're going to see Trump using here in the next few days as well.
[00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:47.162]  Just leave it at that.
[00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:50.005]  We're going to be right down there on top of this big developing story.
[00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:58.614]  The detention centers, other tent cities underneath overpasses that no one even knows about for the adults that are invading, and so much more.
[00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:04.080]  So thank you for keeping us on air so you can see this information the establishment does not want to be getting out.
[00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:16.309]  Also, economist and writer and researcher Harry Dent is joining us to talk about the fact that the COVID-19 lockdowns and everything that's come out of it is going to lead to a global collapse and the evidence is becoming to really mount.
[00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.251]  But that is overwhelming.
[00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:23.716]  Also, all the different satanic, pornographic
[00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:38.314]  TV shows and movies and Super Bowl shows are now being capped off with satanic rapper Lil Nas Gloats after Satan Shoe put out by Nike with real human blood in it, sells for, sells out in 20 minutes.
[00:08:39.774 --> 00:08:50.618]  And of course the music video is him being a male stripper, then being a transvestite, then having sex with Satan, and then becoming Satan.
[00:08:52.449 --> 00:09:02.594]  When I was on Joe Rogan in LA two years ago, I described what really the Satanists are into is sex with Satan.
[00:09:02.674 --> 00:09:05.655]  And that's actually the highest levels of what they're doing.
[00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:10.417]  That's why they kill children, is to then have a sexual experience with demons and the devil.
[00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:11.818]  That's what they're really into.
[00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:16.600]  And I told you, when you start seeing that on TV, you know they're opening up the gates of hell.
[00:09:17.853 --> 00:09:19.394]  Never really seen this on TV before.
[00:09:19.754 --> 00:09:24.996]  Never seen this promoted even in Hollywood depictions of Satanism, but that's really what's going on.
[00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:30.218]  And so I'll be talking more about that coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:39.882]  Now, let me hit these two quadrants of news, and then we're going to come back and get into them in great detail.
[00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:46.865]  There's always been a plan to bring in the worldwide cashless society and all the control that comes with it.
[00:09:48.868 --> 00:09:53.611]  The global Chinese credit score, you'll either buy it or sell, unless you do, as the communists, the globalists say.
[00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:55.672]  That's them saying that.
[00:09:57.573 --> 00:09:59.234]  Oh, there's no Satanism in Hollywood.
[00:09:59.294 --> 00:10:06.598]  Oh, there's no Satanism at that halftime show, even though Madonna's dressed up like Baphomet, simulating a real ritual.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.083]  Oh, Bohemian Grove's not a satanic ritual, even though they're carrying out three different types of them, from three different cultures.
[00:10:22.632 --> 00:10:24.054]  Oh, nobody wants a World ID.
[00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:32.787]  Remember just a year ago, over a year ago, 30 months ago, I said, they're going to have lockdowns, they're going to tighten them down, then release them, but say, oh, you got to have vaccines to have your freedom.
[00:10:33.127 --> 00:10:35.450]  Then they're going to say, well, actually, some people haven't been vaccinated.
[00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:58.394]  And so now it's their fault you can't go out, it's their fault you can't go to the bar, it's their fault you can't go to a football game, and then they'll push to persecute those of us that don't take their mRNA system that literally rapes our DNA and takes over the smallest machines in our body, the mitochondrial engines inside our cells.
[00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.597]  This is a genetic overwrite.
[00:11:02.554 --> 00:11:05.957]  This is not just raping a woman and making her have your child.
[00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:10.962]  This is raping yourselves and it becoming you in a giant satanic ritual.
[00:11:12.664 --> 00:11:14.786]  That's why Jeffrey Epstein was obsessed with this, Bill Gates.
[00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.689]  That's why they were paying off and bribing thousands of scientists.
[00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.173]  How do you think Bill Gates got all the different scientific elites?
[00:11:22.694 --> 00:11:28.101]  From Japan, to India, to China, to much of Russia, to Europe, to the United States, to all be lockstep.
[00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:29.863]  From Brazil, to you name it.
[00:11:30.163 --> 00:11:39.034]  Doesn't matter what the leaders say, all the scientists, all the top health department in NIH, the National Health Service systems, all the CDCs in the world.
[00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:49.078]  They're all lockstep, all trained in the same universities, all funded by the same Robert Barron money, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, but there's something else.
[00:11:49.118 --> 00:12:05.734]  There's the deans of the schools, the medical schools, the scientific firms, jet on private jets are flown around the world and would spend months a year, not just with Jeffrey Epstein, but with other handlers who would bring them in and say, you want drugs, you want money, you want men, you want women, you want children.
[00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.336]  And most would say, I want men, I want children.
[00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:09.417]  Didn't matter.
[00:12:09.777 --> 00:12:11.478]  They would put out what they wanted.
[00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:15.762]  Some, though, the minority would say, I don't want any of it.
[00:12:16.462 --> 00:12:25.690]  And then they would see themselves ostracized, and they would find something they tweeted or something they wrote that wasn't politically correct, and they would be removed from their position of power.
[00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.712]  But most would say, I want money.
[00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:30.334]  I want power.
[00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:31.054]  I want women.
[00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:31.735]  I want men.
[00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:34.157]  They'd say, well, that's not enough.
[00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:42.038]  You have to want children, and you've got to take part in that.
[00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:53.707]  And that's why Hollywood now doesn't just show top rappers having sex with Satan in very provocative behavior, in very graphic behavior.
[00:12:54.667 --> 00:13:03.293]  Now you see the pedophilia and the killing of children, and the big hot thing for 10 years has been beautiful women stomping kittens' brains out.
[00:13:03.914 --> 00:13:05.215]  That's one of the big hot fetishes.
[00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:22.342]  This is the reality of our world, and we go through these cycles over and over and over again, and we are going through this cycle yet again.
[00:13:23.483 --> 00:13:30.188]  And the globalists plan on this being what they call the final revolution, the final cycle, where they will transcend humanity.
[00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.210]  Genesis 3-2-2.
[00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.931]  He ate of the tree,
[00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:38.499]  of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.761]  And now he knew about the systems of good and the systems of evil, was no longer pure with God.
[00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:50.303]  So they said, let him not eat now of the tree of life, lest he live forever like us.
[00:13:51.483 --> 00:13:55.244]  The tree of life is the two serpents, the double helix, which they already knew about.
[00:13:56.845 --> 00:13:58.846]  It was given to them in the symbols by the fallen ones.
[00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:06.608]  The two serpents, the double helix, the DNA, let him not have the knowledge of eternal life.
[00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:15.541]  And now all of this is a giant experiment feeding the whole world into a huge genetic engineering operation.
[00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:27.694]  That's why we don't need guinea pigs, we don't need rabbits, we don't need lab rats, we don't need dogs, we don't need chimpanzees, we don't need great apes, we don't need horses, we don't need goats, we don't need sheep.
[00:14:28.134 --> 00:14:29.214]  We have you.
[00:14:30.094 --> 00:14:32.615]  And we're going to do it to pregnant women and children and everybody.
[00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:43.639]  We're going to make you wear a mask over your face, and we're going to teach you that you're dirty and bad, and we're going to throw out all the logic, and Big Tech's going to hold you down while we do it, and make sure all the mainline good doctors and scientists can't warn you.
[00:14:45.413 --> 00:14:46.854]  Emergency Monday broadcast.
[00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:52.156]  FBI publicly aids child smugglers as Biden's set to announce mandatory COVID passports.
[00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:53.217]  Yep, that's what's coming up.
[00:14:53.257 --> 00:14:54.337]  Here's my two big stacks.
[00:14:55.938 --> 00:15:00.740]  Total race war to break down civilization and society and turn us all against each other.
[00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:06.343]  Massive ongoing race war targeting whites and now Asians with total media cover-up now breaking.
[00:15:07.023 --> 00:15:12.706]  And then, as I told you a month ago, Israel's the model, the UK's the model, Australia's the model, Spain's the model.
[00:15:13.386 --> 00:15:14.947]  Mandatory freedom bracelets.
[00:15:16.334 --> 00:15:21.239]  Well, we're pulling the video in as we speak just during the break.
[00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:21.560]  It broke.
[00:15:37.267 --> 00:15:41.869]  The Ever Given, one of the largest ships in the world, much bigger than a U.S.
[00:15:41.989 --> 00:15:43.750]  aircraft carrier, largest class.
[00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:46.091]  There's only 10 of these ships.
[00:15:46.232 --> 00:15:47.572]  These are the biggest ships in the world.
[00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:54.636]  He was going 13 knots or a little over 13 miles an hour, going into strong headwinds and wrecked.
[00:15:55.618 --> 00:15:59.483]  It's been over a week that it's jammed, the busiest canal in the world.
[00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:02.987]  Over 300 major ships blocked, already causing major problems.
[00:16:03.107 --> 00:16:11.637]  And just as we spoke in the last 30 minutes, it has come off the bottom and is now free, but they're having to inspect it before they allow it to move on.
[00:16:12.758 --> 00:16:15.001]  I'll talk in a moment how this is emblematic.
[00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:30.014]  Of the whole world that is basically sitting on the edge of disaster and just on time delivery and our entire disposable society being so incredibly dangerous here in just a moment.
[00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:40.120]  The next segment I'm going to hit the huge world government mark of the beast official rollout and what's coming next and how we stop it with the whole COVID martial law lockdown.
[00:16:41.572 --> 00:16:49.173]  And then this giant stack of the most incredible footage of Antifa rioting and attacking in the Oregon capital.
[00:16:50.071 --> 00:16:51.872]  And the police defending them and protecting them.
[00:16:52.593 --> 00:17:09.366]  And then we've got insane footage of young female carjackers attacking and killing a man, and the mayor defending the girls because they're black, and little white girls being hunted down and shot in the back by black teenagers in the media defending it.
[00:17:09.827 --> 00:17:16.232]  I mean, this is the media promoting that whites are inherently evil, and they're like Count Dracula or Frankenstein.
[00:17:17.628 --> 00:17:23.375]  And so a minority of minorities are going out and hunting down Asians and whites.
[00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:25.998]  It's it's it's it's absolutely horrible.
[00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:28.040]  And this is the gangster culture out of control.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.842]  That is coming up next segment.
[00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:36.309]  But I want to hit the ever given ship and play an important report here in just a moment.
[00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.411]  But first,
[00:17:40.307 --> 00:17:42.049]  We will not be on air if you don't fund us.
[00:17:42.209 --> 00:17:45.612]  And I know I sit here chirping that out every day on the hour.
[00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:46.633]  This is true.
[00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:49.355]  You know the globalists have sued us over 50 times.
[00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:52.118]  We've gotten 44 of them thrown out.
[00:17:54.264 --> 00:18:00.030]  And so, cross your fingers, you know, knock on wood, there's not been more of them because I know we fight them and most of them have been defeated.
[00:18:01.071 --> 00:18:08.658]  But these other, the big Democratic Party law firms and the rest of them, Georgetown University suing me, trying to shut us down, and they admit they want us off the air.
[00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:09.719]  They want the, quote, kill shot.
[00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:11.921]  So keeping us on air is so important.
[00:18:12.261 --> 00:18:13.823]  Plus, we have great products that you already need.
[00:18:14.383 --> 00:18:15.444]  And it's going to end.
[00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:23.191]  This Wednesday night, the big mega blowout sale, 50% off many of our select best-selling products and free shipping.
[00:18:23.612 --> 00:18:27.035]  The Azobeats sold out under the sale, Alpha Power sold out, Prosecutor's sold out.
[00:18:27.435 --> 00:18:31.239]  Living Defense, the great detoxifier and cleaner for your guts.
[00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:33.001]  It's like a probiotic next level.
[00:18:34.902 --> 00:18:37.085]  But without the microbes, it's just amazing.
[00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:37.745]  Everybody loves it.
[00:18:37.765 --> 00:18:38.406]  You should try it.
[00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:41.409]  It's 50% off and free shipping, selling out.
[00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:50.741]  All iodine products, X2, X3, the topical spray, the counter spray, that's not for ingesting, it's very strong, those are all 50% off free shipping.
[00:18:51.662 --> 00:19:02.451]  We also have Brain Force Plus, 50% off free shipping, Dr. Jones Naturals, charcoal free, charcoal activated toothpaste, fluoride free, amazing toothpaste, that is selling out soon, free shipping, and the
[00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.171]  I think so.
[00:19:34.594 --> 00:19:34.834]  Is it?
[00:19:55.117 --> 00:19:58.739]  My film, Endgame, that I didn't even know we had back in stock as a DVD.
[00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.119]  I plugged it, sold out in one day.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:07.223]  More of those are arriving from Chicago where they got printed tomorrow, so that'll be back up for sale today.
[00:20:07.243 --> 00:20:13.306]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and so much more at infowarestore.com.
[00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:15.367]  Okay, let me just briefly speak to this.
[00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:19.088]  I call it a civilization's Atlantean moment.
[00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:24.111]  Whether you believe Atlantis existed or not is a metaphor, is a real place that Plato said was real.
[00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:26.372]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.843 --> 00:20:59.068]  Waking up like Rip Van Winkle in a civilization that our ancestors built with their strength and their will, and quite frankly their conquest of the natural world and of science.
[00:21:00.429 --> 00:21:13.295]  And so the globalists have bred us to be these mindless little creatures that never engage with conflict with the elite, never demand a better place for humanity, but let the globalists operate as their own superclass that they now see as their own species breaking away from us.
[00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.516]  But really, one problem
[00:21:17.384 --> 00:21:22.272]  And the ship crashes and world trade comes to a standstill.
[00:21:22.332 --> 00:21:23.614]  Half the world trade, roughly.
[00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.338]  A third of it goes through there, but it caused chain reactions.
[00:21:26.358 --> 00:21:28.902]  They estimated half of world trade was affected.
[00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:34.470]  And it's the same thing we see with so many other levels of technology.
[00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:44.775]  Here in Austin, most of the city didn't have water from over 20 water treatment plants because when those systems froze, there were hand valves built decades ago that an engineer had to go turn.
[00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.397]  But since all those engineers retired, everything was automated.
[00:21:47.777 --> 00:21:49.698]  No one knew how to do it.
[00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:55.901]  Let's go to the part of this newscast talking about the ever given ship.
[00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.692]  The massive container ship Ever Given is finally moving again.
[00:22:04.092 --> 00:22:09.455]  The ship is currently on its way to Great Bitter Lake, which is a transit agent at the Suez Canal.
[00:22:09.575 --> 00:22:12.716]  After reaching the ship, we'll undergo a technical inspection.
[00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:15.517]  The Suez Canal Authority has confirmed the reports.
[00:22:16.098 --> 00:22:24.542]  The Ever Given container ship stuck in the Suez Canal was finally pulled free, allowing the crucial trade route to reopen to traffic.
[00:22:25.563 --> 00:22:31.808]  Tuck boats hauled the giant vessel away from the side of the waterway where it had been lodged since last Tuesday.
[00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:35.491]  Efforts will now get underway to restart shipping navigation.
[00:22:35.852 --> 00:22:39.355]  More than 450 vessels waiting near the canyon.
[00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:49.016]  The backlog has strained global supply chains already stretched by the pandemic as the route is a conduit for about 12% of global trade.
[00:22:49.496 --> 00:22:56.679]  Brent crude dropped 0.6% to trade at $64.20 a barrel as of 2.16pm in London.
[00:22:56.979 --> 00:22:59.560]  Alright, that's good.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.400]  So there's the ship.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.401]  It's now out.
[00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:02.501]  Now they hope to move it.
[00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:03.942]  They're inspecting it as she just said.
[00:23:04.662 --> 00:23:13.189]  Just think about the Deepwater Horizon, where the engineer said, if you do what you're doing, it'll blow up, and the bankers that own the company said, we don't care, do it, and it blew up.
[00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.750]  It's the same thing.
[00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:21.215]  It's like those ships aren't supposed to go more than 10 miles an hour, but the captain put it to 13 miles an hour, because he thought he could do what he wanted.
[00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:30.763]  It's that same attitude that these rich, powerful guys and guys in charge get in, where they think they're invincible, and they're not God, and it doesn't go the way they wanted it to.
[00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:33.665]  All right, we'll be right back with the
[00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:37.272]  Unbelievable news of the official takeover.
[00:23:38.392 --> 00:23:39.733]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:41.073 --> 00:23:47.296]  What did Charlie Manson do back in the early 1960s when he committed those murders, Sharon Tate and others?
[00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:50.257]  It was a satanic ritual.
[00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:57.340]  And it was meant to usher in a race war that would then bring in the Illuminati's rule.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.761]  And that's what he said.
[00:23:59.501 --> 00:24:00.641]  And he was on LSD.
[00:24:00.702 --> 00:24:03.923]  He was working with the CIA that was putting LSD out on the streets.
[00:24:05.373 --> 00:24:07.716]  They're in San Francisco.
[00:24:07.776 --> 00:24:08.877]  They're in Los Angeles.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.643]  And that's the Beatles song about him.
[00:24:16.266 --> 00:24:18.149]  What they called Helter Skelter.
[00:24:20.512 --> 00:24:23.716]  And so there is a synthesis being carried out.
[00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:32.072]  Where the globalists create different opposing forces and then out of it create the synthesis of where they want to go and what they want to do.
[00:24:32.152 --> 00:24:40.634]  And if you're conscious of the synthesis and conscious of their agenda, well then you can protect yourself, your family, you can become very successful.
[00:24:41.934 --> 00:24:44.935]  This broadcast is the real college of the world.
[00:24:45.555 --> 00:24:47.956]  And I don't say that again to go, oh, aren't we special?
[00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:49.196]  I wish we weren't special.
[00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:54.877]  My job is to have this knowledge become so understood and so mainstream
[00:24:58.755 --> 00:25:01.536]  That it doesn't work on people, the globalist tactics.
[00:25:02.177 --> 00:25:07.819]  Because if you're aware of this information, they have no power over you.
[00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.661]  The problem is most people that become aware of this information,
[00:25:11.798 --> 00:25:36.967]  I have found actually end up joining with the enemy because the power of the globalist scares them so much and the understanding of how to control people is so delightful and the general public I guess is so corrupt now that that was my only hindsight and that was one of my only big blind spots was that I later learned a lot of people that learned this information from myself and others used it for evil.
[00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:46.399]  I'd use the cheesy analogy of, I guess, Obi-Wan Kenobi teaches Anakin Skywalker about the Force, and then he falls to the dark side.
[00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:50.782]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that goes on, but that's just the way it is, and that's between you and God.
[00:25:55.046 --> 00:25:58.469]  The Bible says, you were neither hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.771]  You don't want to be in the middle of the road.
[00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:03.273]  You want to choose which lane you're in.
[00:26:04.474 --> 00:26:08.277]  And there are a lot of people that are working for the bad guys, and they think they're on the winning team.
[00:26:09.181 --> 00:26:17.985]  And the more they do evil, the more they get into it, the more they don't care, the more they enjoy actually doing bad and deceiving people.
[00:26:18.065 --> 00:26:19.385]  And it's a real disease.
[00:26:19.965 --> 00:26:23.627]  And so goodness is leaving the world in many areas and badness is growing.
[00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:38.213]  And so there is selfishness out there and that the average person is so selfish and has such a short attention span that
[00:26:42.287 --> 00:26:44.048]  They don't care what happens to their neighbor.
[00:26:44.448 --> 00:26:51.011]  They don't care what happens to themselves because they're only thinking in the moment at an animal level.
[00:26:51.311 --> 00:26:57.895]  And so they'll virtue signal and wear a mask or they'll point out something they says is racist so they can feel superior.
[00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:03.878]  They'll claim that they're for non-GMO foods while their store sells them.
[00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:06.239]  It's hypocrisy.
[00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:11.303]  But it's not up to them who guides the world.
[00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:22.467]  It's up to us to guide the world by saying no and by being leaders for the other group that is unconscious, that has been put into a trance state and is unaware of what's happening.
[00:27:22.527 --> 00:27:29.530]  I mean, it was a planned Operation Lockstep 11 years ago by the Rockefellers and subsequent drills and preparations and
[00:27:30.464 --> 00:27:38.581]  Disease X drills at the UN and Event 201 and Crimson Contagion and Dark Winter.
[00:27:40.632 --> 00:28:00.779]  Of how to lock down society, how to prepare society, and Stanford and Harvard and Yale and Oxford and Cambridge studies on how to roll out mandatory vaccines, how to get people to stay in their houses, how to get people to wear masks, how to get compliance, and all those drills and all those preparations are public, and we've shown you in the drills!
[00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:03.540]  Comes out of China.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.580]  People see death.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.901]  They see paramedics.
[00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:08.121]  They see people collapsing.
[00:28:08.461 --> 00:28:09.922]  They see everyone wearing masks.
[00:28:11.152 --> 00:28:13.233]  Within three months, it'll be adopted worldwide.
[00:28:13.293 --> 00:28:18.415]  Then the UN comes in and says no one can leave their houses or have a job till the vaccine's there.
[00:28:18.715 --> 00:28:20.416]  Then the public demands a vaccine.
[00:28:20.716 --> 00:28:24.257]  Vaccines are sped up at rapid pace and delivered early.
[00:28:24.317 --> 00:28:27.999]  The public rejoices that they're not locked up for four years, but only a year.
[00:28:30.131 --> 00:28:34.894]  But then the public learns they still don't have all their freedoms because some won't take the vaccines.
[00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:40.557]  And this will get the general public on board with stopping those that have vaccine hesitancy.
[00:28:40.737 --> 00:28:46.040]  I mean, you can read the whole blueprint and see how they're doing it and why they're doing it.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.682]  Like, bring me the Crimson Contagion folders and all those.
[00:28:48.702 --> 00:28:54.125]  I mean, I showed them on there a few weeks ago, but it's all there, all war-gamed, all drilled, all prepared.
[00:28:56.104 --> 00:29:04.529]  And so now you see, whether it's Illinois, or whether it's Texas, or whether it's New York, or whether it's London, England, or whether it's Germany, it's all the same.
[00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:05.570]  I can't wait.
[00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.932]  I've been closed for 25% occupancy for one year.
[00:29:09.232 --> 00:29:10.092]  I'm going bankrupt.
[00:29:10.433 --> 00:29:18.237]  Everyone must have a shot to be in here, and everyone must do the QR code to be in here, because I want to reopen, not, this was all a fraud, this was all premeditated.
[00:29:18.297 --> 00:29:19.098]  No, no, no.
[00:29:19.198 --> 00:29:20.579]  Take the vaccine, get in line.
[00:29:22.773 --> 00:29:32.036]  But then they don't understand that then when the next wave or the next variant comes out, you'll still be obsolete and you'll shut down again, and this time permanently, even though most already shut down.
[00:29:34.017 --> 00:29:36.078]  So it's all laid out.
[00:29:37.898 --> 00:29:46.502]  It's all war-gamed, and they ran Crimson Contagion a year and a half before they released this virus, and it's the exact drill, the exact places, the exact way it happened.
[00:29:48.102 --> 00:29:50.203]  That way it's their script to follow in the media,
[00:29:51.735 --> 00:30:16.626]  When they actually launched it, and right as they launched it, so they could talk about it on the phone and on the computer and call it an exercise, in October and November and December, the Bill and Linda Gates Foundation, with John Hopkins, the Rockefeller Foundation, the UN and over a hundred other institutions, with the WHO, ran an operation, Event 201, that was
[00:30:20.322 --> 00:30:21.443]  The actual operation.
[00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:24.625]  So there they were calling it a drill.
[00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:30.349]  And it was really Crimson Contagion, lockstep, disease X drill, all prepared, all ready.
[00:30:30.709 --> 00:30:34.592]  And if the NSA hears I'm talking about it, or the FBI hears I'm talking about it, oh, that's just the drill!
[00:30:35.072 --> 00:30:36.613]  And it's the exact thing they were launching.
[00:30:36.833 --> 00:30:43.258]  And then later Bill Gates goes on all these TV shows and says, this was all really just a drill.
[00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:47.392]  COVID-19 was just a test.
[00:30:47.452 --> 00:30:48.092]  Isn't it good?
[00:30:48.152 --> 00:30:49.953]  It shut down the carbon footprint.
[00:30:50.633 --> 00:30:51.953]  It lowered greenhouse gases.
[00:30:51.974 --> 00:30:54.755]  We're going to have regular lockdowns for the environment now.
[00:30:55.175 --> 00:30:59.837]  Plus, terrorists are going to release a real bioweapon very, very soon.
[00:31:01.077 --> 00:31:02.558]  And hundreds of millions are going to die.
[00:31:02.618 --> 00:31:04.599]  And then Bill Gates starts laughing and giggling.
[00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:12.942]  And the co-hosts, whether it's Fareed Zarkaria or Stephen Colbert, start giggling and laughing and wiggling around like snakes in their chairs.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.741]  Oh, there's nothing to be worried about here.
[00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:17.082]  This is all completely normal.
[00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:21.525]  They're celebrating like super villains in a Pixar movie or something.
[00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:26.308]  Because all that's based on real archetypes.
[00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.390]  It's all right here in the Crimson Contagion Reports.
[00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:30.391]  I've done it with Owen Schroyer.
[00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:31.732]  Pull up Van Dot Video.
[00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:33.753]  Just search Crimson Contagion.
[00:31:34.094 --> 00:31:35.495]  Or go read the documents for yourself.
[00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:38.957]  And it says everything that then happened a year and a half later.
[00:31:40.018 --> 00:31:42.760]  And everything that happened a year and a quarter later.
[00:31:44.046 --> 00:31:44.354]  In event 201.
[00:31:47.614 --> 00:32:03.725]  Event 201, and then the next events are coming, and so everybody thinks submitting and accepting the QR codes, oh, we don't have, oh, yesterday I went and got something to eat for lunch, and they come over and they said, would you like to use touchless pay for your safety?
[00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:09.009]  And I went, yeah, but everybody cooked my food in the back, you're walking around in here, this is all just to get me to do this.
[00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:16.494]  He goes, look, I'm just, I know you're a waiter, but I care about you, and I'm gonna explain to you, hell, I've got it right here in my wallet.
[00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:18.867]  Overhead shot, please, when we come back.
[00:32:19.327 --> 00:32:23.150]  I even have the receipt right here.
[00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.992]  And again, oh, first it's, oh, scan the QR code.
[00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:27.152]  No paper menus allowed.
[00:32:27.232 --> 00:32:28.834]  Now you have to get food through your phone.
[00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:31.215]  Oh, now pay this way because it's touchless.
[00:32:31.495 --> 00:32:32.636]  Has nothing to do with safety.
[00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:36.659]  It's all written by corporations, pre-planned a decade ago, now implemented.
[00:32:36.699 --> 00:32:37.019]  G.G.
[00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:39.921]  Pink said six months ago, you'll have to buy and sell with a QR code.
[00:32:39.981 --> 00:32:40.901]  Next is face scanning.
[00:32:41.122 --> 00:32:42.683]  And now it's being announced here in the U.S.
[00:32:42.803 --> 00:32:43.463]  and the U.K.
[00:32:43.703 --> 00:32:44.184]  You understand?
[00:32:45.598 --> 00:32:48.163]  Why does COVID-19 mainly only kill people above 75?
[00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:51.369]  Because most of the people already dying are above 75.
[00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:56.578]  That's the average life expectancy on the world if you average men and women together.
[00:32:57.802 --> 00:33:02.185]  So 90 plus percent of the deaths, New York Times, even in meds, are people that died of something else.
[00:33:02.965 --> 00:33:03.766]  Is it a real virus?
[00:33:03.786 --> 00:33:08.749]  Yes, it's man-made, so the Gates Foundation can own it and control it and put out worse versions later.
[00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:10.891]  This is just a basic simulant version.
[00:33:11.311 --> 00:33:15.994]  But any virus can kill you if you don't have vitamin D, C, zinc, and other essentials like iodine.
[00:33:17.523 --> 00:33:25.238]  So now when they say let's give it to pregnant women, even though it's been causing massive miscarriages, that's an exercise of evil to see what you'll submit to and what you'll put up with.
[00:33:25.719 --> 00:33:27.723]  And once they get the hospitals and systems to do it...
[00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:31.763]  They will then recommit to the lie and say, I'm glad my daughter died.
[00:33:32.743 --> 00:33:40.267]  A doctor said when her daughter died in the miscarriage at seven months pregnant, because it's good for everybody else.
[00:33:40.307 --> 00:33:41.327]  It's like a sacrifice.
[00:33:41.427 --> 00:33:42.748]  I did it for the team.
[00:33:43.048 --> 00:33:44.349]  This is the Stockholm syndrome.
[00:33:44.569 --> 00:33:45.469]  And now here's the headline.
[00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:48.911]  Vaccinating children will likely be necessary to reach herd immunity.
[00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:52.673]  Experts say, but vaccines aren't authorized for kids yet.
[00:33:52.973 --> 00:33:54.273]  Oh, oh my gosh.
[00:33:54.293 --> 00:33:55.034]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:58.256]  And they're not even vaccines, they're mRNA.
[00:33:58.456 --> 00:34:00.556]  And I've been talking to scientists on and off here.
[00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:06.678]  They say the Moderna and the Pfizer aren't the only mRNAs.
[00:34:07.158 --> 00:34:13.360]  They say the virus vector vaccines of AstraZeneca and J&J are the same.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:19.162]  They put the virus with two viruses directly into the mitochondria and take them over.
[00:34:19.742 --> 00:34:21.042]  So it's the same thing.
[00:34:21.062 --> 00:34:23.303]  In fact, it's probably even more invasive now they're saying.
[00:34:24.488 --> 00:34:27.010]  So this is just totally out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:32.174]  It's a giant crime so big they get all of us to be part of it, so we then rationalize what we did.
[00:34:33.856 --> 00:34:34.796]  That's called corruption.
[00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:38.820]  That's the process of corruption, is getting you to accept evil.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.841]  Here's an overhead shot, though.
[00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:46.286]  Vaccinating children will be likely necessary to reach herd immunity.
[00:34:46.326 --> 00:34:46.806]  That's right.
[00:34:46.986 --> 00:34:48.548]  Well, if you've got the shot, you're safe, though.
[00:34:49.494 --> 00:34:50.475]  Oh no, everybody has to have it.
[00:34:50.656 --> 00:34:52.938]  And here is the QR code that G.G.
[00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:53.559]  Pink called for.
[00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.442]  They start you a year ago, scanning to get in a restaurant.
[00:34:56.623 --> 00:34:58.285]  Oh, because paper menus are bad.
[00:34:58.745 --> 00:35:01.208]  Every restaurant in the world starts doing it, basically.
[00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:06.474]  All because the Restaurant Association said, you'll get sued if you don't, but you'll be safe if you do this.
[00:35:06.635 --> 00:35:07.476]  Just all made up!
[00:35:10.037 --> 00:35:13.419]  Oh, here's this touchless system so you'll be safe, the waiter said.
[00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:14.319]  I said, no I'm not.
[00:35:14.359 --> 00:35:17.361]  You cook the food, it's brought out here, it's in the air, it's all made up.
[00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:18.841]  Hey man, I'm just told to do it.
[00:35:19.262 --> 00:35:21.303]  And I said, buddy, this is here to get rid of your job in the future.
[00:35:21.323 --> 00:35:24.744]  Where everything's delivered by robots, where we're all non-essential.
[00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:25.825]  And Klaus Schwab,
[00:35:27.173 --> 00:35:27.813]  He admits that.
[00:35:27.853 --> 00:35:30.834]  He said, no more industries where people are in close contact.
[00:35:30.914 --> 00:35:37.475]  They're putting us in prisons with an automated system of robots that controls us to make us obsolete to prepare to exterminate us.
[00:35:37.695 --> 00:35:49.638]  You can't have a human-run system and then release real bioweapons or electromagnetic weapons that kill most people because some groups will organize and fight back and even a small minority of people organized will defeat the globalists and they'll be hunted down!
[00:35:49.658 --> 00:35:56.500]  So you've got to be fully domesticated, put in your lockdown pod with the robots delivering you your food as
[00:35:58.203 --> 00:35:59.384]  The Davos Group says they will.
[00:36:02.545 --> 00:36:06.848]  So see, first it's, oh, if you don't have a cell phone, you can't eat here.
[00:36:06.888 --> 00:36:07.648]  We don't have paper menus.
[00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:10.389]  Oh, if you don't have a cell phone, you can't pay for your food.
[00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.591]  Oh, if you don't have a cell phone, you can't go outside.
[00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:13.491]  It's what tracks you.
[00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.692]  And built around that is the total control.
[00:36:15.712 --> 00:36:19.054]  Now in China, you have to have a cell phone or you starve to death on the street.
[00:36:20.254 --> 00:36:21.815]  And it's all state run and state controlled.
[00:36:22.155 --> 00:36:23.216]  And this is the model.
[00:36:23.496 --> 00:36:24.237]  This is the system.
[00:36:26.078 --> 00:36:29.259]  Let's play a few of these clips and I'll get into the huge announcements that have just taken place.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:38.423]  Here is Fauci, the cult leader, in the year 2021 saying, Children can play but only if they wear masks, you see, because they're dirty little creatures.
[00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:45.306]  Even though they don't get sick from COVID, they could breed it inside themselves and you can't trust these dirty little creatures.
[00:36:45.907 --> 00:36:49.408]  Oh, but if the border's wide open, we give children directly to known smugglers.
[00:36:49.648 --> 00:36:51.449]  The FBI just officially approved that.
[00:36:51.629 --> 00:36:52.950]  We'll cover it next hour.
[00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.373]  This is the cult leader that's got you in his jaws, and he's never gonna turn loose!
[00:37:00.416 --> 00:37:03.278]  This is the crime lord, the genetic mad scientist.
[00:37:03.318 --> 00:37:03.719]  Here it is.
[00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:12.426]  If parents are vaccinated, they still do need to be concerned about their unvaccinated children playing together in groups.
[00:37:12.486 --> 00:37:12.987]  Is that right?
[00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.553]  Yeah, the children can clearly wind up getting infected.
[00:37:18.593 --> 00:37:31.123]  When we talk about what you can do when you're vaccinated, you can certainly have members of a family, if the adults are vaccinated, and you're in the home with your child, you don't need to wear a mask and you can have physical contact.
[00:37:31.143 --> 00:37:31.564]  How nice!
[00:37:31.764 --> 00:37:40.391]  When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks when they're interacting with groups from multiple households.
[00:37:41.272 --> 00:37:41.913]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:37:41.973 --> 00:37:44.817]  This is how Howard Hughes' mother made him insane.
[00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:49.944]  She made him wear a mask, scrub his hands till he bled, and later he became totally insane and locked himself up.
[00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:53.830]  So, oh, you might get infected if your children go out.
[00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.191]  You might get hit by a car.
[00:37:55.412 --> 00:37:56.353]  You might get mugged.
[00:37:56.573 --> 00:37:58.096]  You might get sun and get skin cancer.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.282]  But we all know staying inside is what makes you depressed, which makes you a shut-in, which makes you mentally ill.
[00:38:04.502 --> 00:38:06.102]  So stay inside and watch Big Tech.
[00:38:06.562 --> 00:38:12.184]  And it's Big Tech that won't let you criticize this, because it's not the UN science, even though everything the UN says is a lie.
[00:38:12.464 --> 00:38:13.765]  Everything Fauci says is a lie.
[00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:19.227]  Because Big Tech's invested in Big Pharma, we warned you about this a decade ago, and it's rolling out their takeover.
[00:38:20.347 --> 00:38:24.088]  They are the gag in your mouth, while the system chains you up.
[00:38:24.448 --> 00:38:25.589]  Here is the tourism
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.300]  I don't know.
[00:38:54.614 --> 00:38:56.515]  Out of the Middle East or wherever you're coming from.
[00:38:56.735 --> 00:38:58.817]  And you've got all sorts of diseases like TB and others.
[00:38:59.117 --> 00:39:00.378]  Oh, don't even test them!
[00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:03.560]  Don't even check what foster parents the children are given to.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.721]  26 at a time.
[00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.702]  The FBI just waived background checks.
[00:39:07.042 --> 00:39:09.424]  Literally joining officially with child smuggling.
[00:39:09.684 --> 00:39:10.844]  It's just lawlessness.
[00:39:11.045 --> 00:39:15.327]  But you, you have a domestic internal checkpoint ID.
[00:39:15.668 --> 00:39:16.108]  Passport.
[00:39:17.517 --> 00:39:17.957]  So here it is.
[00:39:18.017 --> 00:39:22.421]  Government minister says people should call out others for hugging their loved ones.
[00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:23.702]  That's right.
[00:39:23.742 --> 00:39:26.624]  Don't see your parents in the nursing home while we kill them with other diseases.
[00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:27.165]  That's right.
[00:39:27.205 --> 00:39:32.069]  Don't go see your family member that was totally healthy that we put a tube down their throat and blew their lungs out for money.
[00:39:32.709 --> 00:39:33.770]  Medical tyranny.
[00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.174]  Stay in your houses while the hospitals are prisons, while your children are wearing gags.
[00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:43.838]  A giant nightmare science fiction horror movie unfolding right now.
[00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:46.861]  Here is the tourism minister in the UK.
[00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:48.933]  That's enough.
[00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:55.476]  We know what to do, we know how to behave, and the Supreme Court Justice over there said it's going to last 10 years and basically forever.
[00:40:16.448 --> 00:40:26.616]  Yes, don't hug, don't kiss, oh no, oh my gosh, we'll have a half a million dead, and it wasn't even 50,000 dead, and that was the same number would have died last year in the UK anyways.
[00:40:26.817 --> 00:40:27.877]  It's all made up, all lies.
[00:40:29.018 --> 00:40:32.421]  Oh, there's no flu now, because it's all been put on the list there.
[00:40:33.102 --> 00:40:43.871]  And total phobia now, where you hear someone cough, you hear someone sneeze, oh, oh no, when all you need is your essential vitamins and minerals, all you need is clean water, all you need is good food, and all you need to do is get outside.
[00:40:44.952 --> 00:40:53.656]  Studies, every city, every place, every country that locked everything down had higher death tolls, higher levels of disease, because other things were killing them.
[00:40:55.056 --> 00:41:02.159]  Oh, they love black people so much, but they're never on the news saying people need vitamin D3, or vitamin C, or zinc, or iodine that's essential.
[00:41:02.219 --> 00:41:02.559]  No, no, no.
[00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.900]  Don't let folks know that.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.560]  Just tell them, stay in your house.
[00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:09.522]  All the massive numbers of old people dying, so incredibly evil.
[00:41:10.002 --> 00:41:10.942]  I've got more on this.
[00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:12.023]  I haven't hit the stack yet.
[00:41:13.419 --> 00:41:15.880]  The global passports, the global IDs, the freedom bracelets.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:21.061]  They're now saying in mainstream news, everything that Israel did, it will now be done here.
[00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:22.641]  That's what Cuomo said.
[00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:24.061]  Freedom bracelets, everything.
[00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:25.802]  Because there's no limit.
[00:41:26.002 --> 00:41:28.943]  Because it's always, oh, just do a little more, it'll go back to normal.
[00:41:29.163 --> 00:41:30.443]  Do a little more, it'll go back to normal.
[00:41:30.723 --> 00:41:33.724]  While the big box stores and big tech take over.
[00:41:33.964 --> 00:41:35.044]  While China takes over.
[00:41:36.596 --> 00:41:37.917]  While the United States shuts down.
[00:41:37.957 --> 00:41:40.378]  This was all strategically deployed to take us down.
[00:41:40.398 --> 00:41:41.479]  The borders are being dissolved.
[00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.480]  The Republic's being dissolved.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:42.920]  It's sick.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.562]  That's why it's important now to spread the word.
[00:41:45.602 --> 00:41:47.623]  People are now more ready to wake up than ever.

[00:43:20.788 --> 00:43:21.549]  InfoWars.
[00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:22.811]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:43:23.092 --> 00:43:23.432]  Today.
[00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:28.961]  The District of Columbia is a criminal enterprise now under communist Chinese control.
[00:43:29.701 --> 00:43:31.541]  That is a well-known documented fact.
[00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.782]  We are living in incredible times.
[00:43:34.282 --> 00:43:37.664]  We'll break that down coming up and how they're trying to trigger a race war in America.
[00:43:37.704 --> 00:43:46.607]  A lot of shocking information that the MSM is trying to suppress on, off the chart level, a black-on-white and Asian crime orchestrated by the media.
[00:43:46.867 --> 00:43:47.867]  That's all coming up.
[00:43:48.247 --> 00:43:49.808]  Here's another key report before we hit it.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.561]  Well I'm sick and tired of smart guys!
[00:43:54.121 --> 00:43:59.443]  It should be blindingly obvious by now, Joe Biden is a complete liar.
[00:43:59.683 --> 00:44:02.524]  We didn't lock people up in cages, we didn't separate families.
[00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:07.386]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:11.407]  Where a nation says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:44:11.467 --> 00:44:16.629]  And a lot of the migrants coming in saying they're coming in because you promised to make things better.
[00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:24.733]  The idea that Joe Biden said, come, because I heard the other day that they're coming because they know I'm a nice guy and I won't do it.
[00:44:24.753 --> 00:44:25.614]  They're saying this.
[00:44:26.014 --> 00:44:26.294]  Yeah.
[00:44:26.654 --> 00:44:27.455]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:28.415]  They're not.
[00:44:28.495 --> 00:44:33.438]  President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era.
[00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:34.538]  Do you agree?
[00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:35.299]  Yes.
[00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:39.441]  If not, why not abolish it if it's a relic of the Jim Crow era?
[00:44:40.476 --> 00:44:42.957]  Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible.
[00:44:43.357 --> 00:44:46.579]  But there must be a method to his increasing dementia.
[00:44:46.839 --> 00:44:51.622]  I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate.
[00:44:52.782 --> 00:45:00.206]  So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to
[00:45:02.126 --> 00:45:07.330]  Anyway, we're going to get a lot done.
[00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:19.679]  As those around him, call all the shots rendering the United States a full-blown corporatocracy with the executive power of our supposed republic in the hands of, well, who really knows.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.923]  And I'd be happy to take questions if that's what I'm supposed to do, Nance, whatever you want me to do.
[00:45:27.081 --> 00:45:28.823]  Who am I turning this over to?
[00:45:28.843 --> 00:45:31.364]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[00:45:31.464 --> 00:45:33.966]  I think it's time for our friends in the press to leave now.
[00:45:34.226 --> 00:45:37.829]  Thank you.
[00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:46.415]  And now, by any means necessary, the foreign corporatocracy that owns Joe Biden wants to make the District of Columbia a state.
[00:45:46.775 --> 00:45:49.437]  She won't answer these, and I think it's because there really is not.
[00:45:49.457 --> 00:45:51.259]  No, she's happy to answer your questions.
[00:45:51.399 --> 00:45:52.440]  A general question.
[00:45:53.308 --> 00:45:56.730]  But who would actually be the beneficiary of this super state?
[00:46:18.044 --> 00:46:23.989]  How many electors of the district, which are entitled under the 23rd Amendment, are there?
[00:46:24.689 --> 00:46:25.990]  Three electors, Congressman.
[00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:26.951]  Three electors.
[00:46:27.452 --> 00:46:30.354]  And under the bill proposed, all of D.C.
[00:46:30.414 --> 00:46:38.501]  would become a state, except a tiny sliver, which is the size of a park, which would become the federal district, correct?
[00:46:39.386 --> 00:46:40.647]  That is correct, Congressman.
[00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:42.987]  Under the terms of the 23rd Amendment?
[00:46:43.007 --> 00:46:44.048]  That is correct.
[00:46:57.614 --> 00:47:01.755]  Would only have within it the White House, the U.S.
[00:47:01.795 --> 00:47:06.116]  Capitol, and some other federal buildings and the National Mall and some monuments.
[00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:06.896]  Is that right?
[00:47:07.816 --> 00:47:08.876]  That is my understanding.
[00:47:09.217 --> 00:47:10.217]  It's a very small area.
[00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:20.059]  So really, the only permanent residence in this new created seat of power would be the president occupied by Mr. Biden.
[00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:20.539]  Is that right?
[00:47:21.314 --> 00:47:29.260]  It is certainly conceivable that the first family would be the only residents or one of only a handful of residents of this new area.
[00:47:35.126 --> 00:47:45.155]  Mr. Biden would become electors and would be voting in the Electoral College in the 2024 election and would be still entitled to three electoral votes.
[00:47:45.175 --> 00:47:45.735]  Is that correct?
[00:47:45.755 --> 00:47:52.000]  But it is conceivable under the 23rd Amendment that yes, the First Family would potentially control the Electoral College.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.081]  All right, folks, do you see the fast one?
[00:47:53.542 --> 00:47:54.262]  They're pulling there.
[00:47:54.322 --> 00:47:56.224]  This is a setup of permanent dictatorship.
[00:47:56.664 --> 00:47:59.166]  These people are very, very, very slick.
[00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:02.589]  The District of Corporatocracy Superstates at Bandon Video.
[00:48:02.609 --> 00:48:03.090]  Please share it.
[00:48:05.393 --> 00:48:07.854]  And we're now into our number two.
[00:48:08.814 --> 00:48:09.994]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:11.835]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:48:14.036 --> 00:48:17.777]  Globalism is the disease.
[00:48:17.797 --> 00:48:22.398]  1776, an Americana with God's good grace is the cure.
[00:48:22.418 --> 00:48:30.941]  All right, we have a very important guest, an economist and bestselling author joining us in the next hour, Mr. Dent.
[00:48:34.397 --> 00:48:46.913]  To look at what's really happening with the world economy and just being honest with folks how much trouble it's in because of the COVID lockdowns that are now still triggering a ongoing consolidation of wealth and collapse.
[00:48:47.494 --> 00:48:49.216]  That is coming up in the third hour.
[00:48:51.345 --> 00:48:58.951]  The fourth hour, we've got Gerald Cilente ahead of Owen Schroer, who's down on the Texas border where Ted Cruz and Trump and all of them have been and are going.
[00:48:59.671 --> 00:49:13.062]  In the Rio Grande at the detention center, that's all going to be posted to BandotVideo and Infowars.com in the next few hours and live on The War Room today, 3 to 6 p.m., and then on my show tomorrow,
[00:49:14.679 --> 00:49:19.181]  Lord willing, Owen will be reporting live here on the air from the Rio Grande River with us.
[00:49:20.101 --> 00:49:21.702]  So look forward to that intel.
[00:49:23.223 --> 00:49:24.883]  That's what I'm going to cover next segment.
[00:49:26.324 --> 00:49:29.525]  A few things stagger me because I'm so used to globalist corruption.
[00:49:29.565 --> 00:49:31.806]  I know what their endgame is, which is hell on earth.
[00:49:32.827 --> 00:49:33.727]  Total extremism.
[00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:42.731]  But to see it move this fast, to see the FBI say, oh, you can now just give children
[00:49:44.431 --> 00:49:46.172]  To people that don't even have background checks.
[00:49:46.672 --> 00:49:48.433]  Now, we know Obama did that on purpose.
[00:49:48.453 --> 00:49:56.137]  They had a Senate report that he placed tens of thousands of children with known smugglers, some of them pedophiles, and some of the kids ended up dead, many disappeared.
[00:49:57.077 --> 00:50:08.063]  It's now officially being done with the FBI director saying, do it, and that each unauthorized, unknown person can have 26 children with them.
[00:50:08.943 --> 00:50:09.884]  Now, when those children
[00:50:11.207 --> 00:50:15.149]  Get abused or killed, the FBI will be more corrupted and will cover its ass.
[00:50:15.169 --> 00:50:17.490]  And this is how the process of corruption operates.
[00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:31.537]  Remember when the UN directed through Fauci and I said Trump's being set up to put COVID positive, and that just means the flu, a cold, all those come up positive with a PCR test, in with nursing homes to get people sick to die.
[00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:40.502]  And that when they did die and they ordered, like in the case of New York or Michigan or Pennsylvania or other states,
[00:50:42.264 --> 00:50:45.786]  The operators of the nursing homes said, we're not going to take sick people in here and kill these old people.
[00:50:46.127 --> 00:50:46.727]  That's criminal.
[00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:53.952]  They said, we'll have Letitia James, the Soros Attorney General of New York, indict you if you don't do it.
[00:50:53.992 --> 00:50:54.833]  That's in the headlines.
[00:50:55.373 --> 00:50:59.256]  Letitia James threatens arrest, threatens license if they don't do it.
[00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:03.639]  Now she runs the investigation of the deaths and of the governor.
[00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:07.962]  Yeah, there's old headlines.
[00:51:08.262 --> 00:51:10.263]  6,300 COVID-19 patients in nursing homes.
[00:51:10.563 --> 00:51:11.244]  It was way more than that.
[00:51:13.968 --> 00:51:14.568]  Threaten them.
[00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:22.730]  And see, once that happened, all those Democrat governors that followed the Fauci directive, Republican governors are smart enough not to.
[00:51:23.951 --> 00:51:25.071]  They're like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:51:25.091 --> 00:51:26.972]  We're not going to do that.
[00:51:26.992 --> 00:51:29.052]  All of them are now blackmailable and controllable.
[00:51:29.452 --> 00:51:36.274]  Just like the FBI director says, yeah, you can just take kids randomly, don't even know their names, who they are.
[00:51:36.474 --> 00:51:39.395]  They're being processed, many of them, in less than eight hours.
[00:51:41.038 --> 00:51:44.019]  I've got senators saying under Obama it was like two weeks.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.001]  Under Trump we just sent most of them back.
[00:51:47.921 --> 00:51:54.865]  We're now processing children in less than 24 hours and just handing them to people that the Democrat Party says is okay.
[00:51:55.065 --> 00:51:56.506]  See, I said I'll cover that next segment.
[00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:57.886]  I started covering it now.
[00:51:58.187 --> 00:51:58.727]  That's coming up.
[00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:01.048]  But let's look at this right here.
[00:52:01.088 --> 00:52:03.869]  Let's just go over these headlines and then this will tell everybody what they need to know.
[00:52:04.149 --> 00:52:04.910]  Overhead shot please.
[00:52:06.465 --> 00:52:11.689]  Ministers looking at Israel Green Pass to allow vaccinated to enter restaurants and bars daily mail.
[00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.752]  So, in the UK, that is the model.
[00:52:14.772 --> 00:52:18.495]  They promised they wouldn't do that, so you wouldn't form opposition, and of course now they're doing it.
[00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.016]  It's all a formula of deception.
[00:52:21.172 --> 00:52:23.073]  Here comes the global vaccine passports.
[00:52:23.174 --> 00:52:23.894]  Zero hedge.
[00:52:23.914 --> 00:52:28.237]  The UN calling for it and calling for Xi Jinping's plan to be adopted.
[00:52:28.898 --> 00:52:29.738]  Told you that would always happen.
[00:52:30.539 --> 00:52:31.360]  They're here.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.342]  Biden regime is developing vaccine passport.
[00:52:34.722 --> 00:52:36.684]  Americans must have to engage in commerce.
[00:52:38.745 --> 00:52:43.308]  And then all the fines and fees that will be attached to your global ID, which will be your global social credit score.
[00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.910]  Video.
[00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.352]  Fauci says kids need to wear face masks to play together.
[00:52:48.432 --> 00:52:50.234]  Yes, we're not living in a cult nightmare.
[00:52:51.345 --> 00:52:55.950]  Government minister says people should call out others for hugging their loved ones, even in their homes.
[00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:57.251]  Don't hug your loved ones!
[00:52:58.472 --> 00:53:02.116]  UK now considering digital face scanning to enter pubs, you see.
[00:53:02.136 --> 00:53:03.417]  It's the global ID.
[00:53:03.497 --> 00:53:04.438]  It's always more, more, more.
[00:53:04.959 --> 00:53:09.363]  Festival trendies demand singer be removed from lineup for opposing vaccine passports.
[00:53:10.925 --> 00:53:12.407]  They say anything to get us back in.
[00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:14.049]  Anything.
[00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.890]  How about your life, huh?
[00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.951]  How about your health?
[00:53:16.051 --> 00:53:16.952]  Oh, you'll give that up, too.
[00:53:17.692 --> 00:53:23.978]  Draft report on joint WHO-China study says it's extremely unlikely COVID-19 originated from the lab.
[00:53:24.018 --> 00:53:29.543]  No, it's just totally man-made, and Fauci and Bill Gates funded 11 programs in it of gain-of-function coronaviruses.
[00:53:29.923 --> 00:53:30.764]  That's even mainstream news.
[00:53:32.162 --> 00:53:44.688]  Cuomo releases vaccine passport called Excelsior Pass, kind of like the Israelis wristband slave pass, tracker chip, ankle bracelet, but for the arm, is called the Freedom Pass.
[00:53:46.008 --> 00:53:51.030]  Well, jump out of the way, comic book master.
[00:53:52.251 --> 00:53:55.993]  Mr. Lee, forget Excelsior, now we have the Excelsior Pass.
[00:53:57.847 --> 00:53:59.929]  Secretary of State Blinken suggests U.S.
[00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:02.631]  won't punish China for unleashing COVID-19 on the world.
[00:54:02.651 --> 00:54:03.532]  Yeah, there's video of that.
[00:54:03.992 --> 00:54:05.333]  CCP, useful idiots.
[00:54:05.413 --> 00:54:05.653]  U.S.
[00:54:05.713 --> 00:54:09.016]  rep slams WHO COVID origin whitewash report.
[00:54:09.877 --> 00:54:16.062]  Bombshell, potentially toxic face masks made in Wuhan, China were sent to Canadian daycares and schools.
[00:54:16.162 --> 00:54:19.464]  Yes, make those babies wear those toxic Chinese masks.
[00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:27.051]  Arizona governor lifts mask mandates and all COVID restrictions, but the stores and businesses vowed a virtue signal and never stop.
[00:54:27.978 --> 00:54:30.119]  They got the corporations because the lawyers tell them to do it.
[00:54:33.022 --> 00:54:33.802]  It has begun!
[00:54:33.902 --> 00:54:35.964]  First COVID-19 pass introduced in New York.
[00:54:36.684 --> 00:54:37.144]  Breaking!
[00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:40.827]  Trump tells Fox News why he supported Warp Speed so things could reopen.
[00:54:41.027 --> 00:54:42.568]  Again, he was caught in the same stupid trap.
[00:54:43.269 --> 00:54:44.369]  Or maybe he was, maybe you knew.
[00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:53.496]  The Fourth Amendment is being dismantled as big government is expanding NSA data gathering and surveillance and preparing for vaccine passports run by the NSA.
[00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:58.391]  Government cruelty with Fauci in the mask.
[00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:03.613]  Video police arrest old man for pulling gun on attacking antivitamins.
[00:55:03.653 --> 00:55:06.573]  That's in our next stack of news.
[00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:09.174]  It never ends.
[00:55:09.294 --> 00:55:15.816]  UK people over 70 to get third dose of COVID-19 vaccine because Dr. Bill Gates says so.
[00:55:16.456 --> 00:55:21.178]  And here the UN chief criticizes wealthy countries for stockpile of vaccines.
[00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:29.066]  That creates the illusion that it's so precious and it's like a Mercedes Benz or a private jet or a Rolex.
[00:55:29.126 --> 00:55:30.867]  You've just got to have one.
[00:55:31.167 --> 00:55:33.149]  You've got to have one right now.
[00:55:33.269 --> 00:55:35.170]  This is the thing you need.
[00:55:35.531 --> 00:55:38.493]  But then you get it and they go, sorry, you don't get the extra rides.
[00:55:38.513 --> 00:55:39.334]  You still gotta wear a mask.
[00:55:39.354 --> 00:55:40.174]  You're still not essential.
[00:55:40.394 --> 00:55:41.835]  Your business still can't completely reopen.
[00:55:42.056 --> 00:55:43.897]  Oh, but all the big global corporations, they can.
[00:55:44.798 --> 00:55:46.739]  And there's evil vaccine nationalism.
[00:55:47.059 --> 00:55:52.644]  You know, some countries aren't following the UN's exact directives, which means Bill Gates' exact directives.
[00:55:54.428 --> 00:56:01.694]  But it's the UN order to lock down the world that starved an additional 10 million people to death.
[00:56:01.954 --> 00:56:05.577]  Absolutely biblical.
[00:56:05.877 --> 00:56:09.299]  Totally insane in our face in a way never before seen.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.462]  Okay, when we come back, whoo!
[00:56:13.643 --> 00:56:14.523]  Lordy, lordy, lordy.
[00:56:14.583 --> 00:56:15.985]  This is gonna take me most of the hour.
[00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:24.091]  I got clip after clip, and I got document after document, and I got bombshell after bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[00:56:25.765 --> 00:56:43.894]  The total evaporation of the border, evaporation of all law, evaporation of all rights, children being massively exploited by the hundreds of thousands per month, disappearing into a labyrinth of abuse that makes even Q fantasies about child abuse and child sex trafficking look tame.
[00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:49.576]  So see, everything Q said was about to be revealed, was about to be revealed, but in our face.
[00:56:49.676 --> 00:56:50.857]  Gun confiscation, everything.
[00:56:51.137 --> 00:56:52.118]  I've got articles right here.
[00:56:52.918 --> 00:57:02.062]  Where bipartisanly, the Democrats are saying they have the votes to ban semi-autos and register guns nationwide and begin warrantless confiscation.
[00:57:02.403 --> 00:57:05.084]  So that's coming up the final segment of this hour.
[00:57:05.264 --> 00:57:07.185]  Only raising the alarm can stop this.
[00:57:07.645 --> 00:57:10.146]  We've got to get the governors, legislatures moving to say no.
[00:57:10.487 --> 00:57:14.869]  We've got to expose the COVID lockdown as a hoax, power grab, or we all fall.
[00:57:15.868 --> 00:57:18.609]  Fauci and Gates have to be exposed and go to prison.
[00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.331]  The globalists have to get in trouble, and they're that close.
[00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.012]  Epstein was coming out.
[00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:29.155]  All the information was coming out with the Clintons and with Gates, and then they launched this as their distraction.
[00:57:29.715 --> 00:57:32.036]  They did this because they're weak, not because they're strong.
[00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:37.739]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.080]  March 29th, 2021.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:40.921]  What a time to be alive.
[00:57:45.742 --> 00:57:54.285]  They're going to tell people, oh, you'll keep your easygoing life, your bars, your pool halls, your strip clubs, your whatever it is, your gay parades.
[00:57:55.245 --> 00:57:57.626]  But you're going to have to take these 10 shots a year at least.
[00:57:57.646 --> 00:57:59.687]  You're going to have to have a face scan to buy and sell.
[00:57:59.747 --> 00:58:03.168]  And oh, by the way, you're going to have to close your business when we say so for the common cold.
[00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:07.530]  No, things are going to get progressively worse the more people submit.
[00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:12.111]  And I watch the left with mass Stockholm syndrome, but it's beyond that.
[00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:13.212]  It's a spiritual evil.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:14.960]  They love it.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.903]  They like being abused, and they like us going along with it.
[00:58:18.163 --> 00:58:20.645]  They like the reflected glory of the New World Order.
[00:58:21.305 --> 00:58:23.587]  They like seeing the power over America.
[00:58:24.068 --> 00:58:26.950]  They like seeing America fall and crumble.
[00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:28.271]  It makes them feel big.
[00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:31.333]  Because they grew up in this big, open, free, rich nation.
[00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:34.416]  They were taught by the media and by universities to hate it.
[00:58:34.716 --> 00:58:36.898]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be old, they could be young.
[00:58:38.359 --> 00:58:41.101]  They were taught to resent it, and it makes them feel good.
[00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:43.343]  Like a pyromaniac burning down a house.
[00:58:44.932 --> 00:58:45.812]  Even though they're inside it.
[00:58:48.853 --> 00:59:06.179]  So, there are so many videos at WorldStarHipHop of old white people, young white people, and Asians being knocked out, being shot, being stabbed, being killed, being pushed on train tracks, and it's celebrated because whites are inherently evil.
[00:59:07.059 --> 00:59:10.540]  And you see the culture, like Senator Duckworth saying, whites are inherently bad.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.241]  She's the equivalent of a black Nazi.
[00:59:14.608 --> 00:59:19.230]  And of course, that's all condoned that's in the WikiLeaks, where Hillary says, accelerate the culture war.
[00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:22.331]  They're globalists robbing the country, selling us out to China.
[00:59:22.931 --> 00:59:23.772]  What's their only hope?
[00:59:26.013 --> 00:59:31.595]  Get us all so busy fighting with each other and hating each other that we don't understand that we're all being screwed together.
[00:59:33.035 --> 00:59:37.117]  So the globalists put Planned Parenthood in the black neighborhoods to make sure they can kill as many black babies as they can.
[00:59:37.797 --> 00:59:40.298]  But then the blacks that are born, they make sure don't have a daddy in the house.
[00:59:40.678 --> 00:59:41.799]  They watch gangster rap.
[00:59:42.619 --> 00:59:43.800]  Now it's devil worshiper rap.
[00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:48.223]  And they disintegrate.
[00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:57.495]  And then you have the new Black Panther Party and others that I've had on the show saying, if you're going to thug out and mug, go mug whites.
[00:59:59.428 --> 01:00:00.708]  Go get their cracker ass!
[01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:05.250]  And so whether you're in Houston, Texas or Dallas, Texas, you can see this all the time.
[01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.090]  Now in Austin, the areas east of Austin aren't safe to go into.
[01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:10.971]  And I've told people that the media battles to cover it up.
[01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:14.652]  Does that mean even a large minority of black folks are racist and hateful?
[01:00:15.033 --> 01:00:15.233]  No!
[01:00:15.553 --> 01:00:16.173]  They're good people.
[01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:19.194]  They know that the thugs are out of control and they can't stand them.
[01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:23.335]  And they wish the police would do something about them, but the police now are scared and won't even come into those areas.
[01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:38.748]  And so the society is breaking apart and I've got all these videos and all these articles of young white people, old white people, you name it, being executed, being burned up, being stabbed, being pushed in front of train tracks only because they were white.
[01:00:40.308 --> 01:00:47.210]  And it's a thing now known by the left that if you're under 18, you can kill people and only get maybe a year or two in jail.
[01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:52.371]  That's why these young girls, 15 and 13, carjacked, un-Asian,
[01:00:54.997 --> 01:01:07.340]  Carjacked him, tasered him, wrecked, because he hit the accelerator, died, and the mayor said that he was at fault because he should have had his doors locked even though it was a Uber driver.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:18.322]  So see, record level black attacks in DC on whites or Asians, and believe me, it's scary.
[01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:19.022]  I've been there.
[01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:22.843]  A lot of the black folks are super nice, but a lot of black folks look at you and say, you shouldn't be here.
[01:01:23.962 --> 01:01:29.805]  I was at a CBS with my wife there last time, and I probably had 10 black people walk right by and say, you shouldn't be here, buddy.
[01:01:31.025 --> 01:01:33.427]  And so, that's how bad this has gotten.
[01:01:33.767 --> 01:01:37.488]  That's the racial divide the left has created for the Chycons.
[01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:43.191]  LeBron James says white people are bad and America's bad, but he won't say a word about Communist China and its slave camps.
[01:01:43.231 --> 01:01:45.612]  No, because he's a scumbag.
[01:01:47.173 --> 01:01:48.734]  He knows to toe the corporate line.
[01:01:48.794 --> 01:01:51.415]  So, here are some of the headlines right here.
[01:01:51.615 --> 01:01:52.916]  Vatican Cardinal.
[01:01:53.925 --> 01:01:58.508]  In a globalized world, there are no borders, but the Vatican has 100 and 200 foot walls.
[01:01:59.409 --> 01:02:02.932]  Remember this, Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[01:02:03.832 --> 01:02:04.253]  Purposely.
[01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:05.674]  Now here's the new bombshell.
[01:02:06.114 --> 01:02:07.595]  Direct links to the FBI announcement.
[01:02:08.055 --> 01:02:13.880]  FBI waives background check requirements for those housing unaccompanied minors as young as two years of age.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.825]  Look, you've got a male smuggler here holding the hand of a little girl and a little boy with a bunch of other little kids.
[01:02:22.244 --> 01:02:23.964]  They're being brought in, handed over to Democrats.
[01:02:24.424 --> 01:02:25.665]  He goes back and gets more kids.
[01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:27.605]  No one even knows where they're coming from.
[01:02:27.645 --> 01:02:28.645]  I'll cover this next segment.
[01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:32.966]  Biden administration wants volunteers from U.S.
[01:02:33.026 --> 01:02:35.867]  agencies to help facilities with migrant children.
[01:02:35.887 --> 01:02:37.507]  Aww, the volunteers.
[01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:41.308]  It's the Pied Piper leading your children right into the cave, right into the river.
[01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:46.249]  FBI endorses child trafficking, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:48.170]  Oh, they can just waive federal law now.
[01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:49.410]  They're God, though they're not.
[01:02:51.328 --> 01:02:57.409]  Biden politically is engaging in the end of this country as we know it.
[01:02:57.809 --> 01:03:04.271]  And now we have video next segment of his political operative blocking Ted Cruz from filming illegals in the Texas detention center.
[01:03:04.931 --> 01:03:07.031]  And she says she does it for their dignity.
[01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:08.672]  He's treating them like animals.
[01:03:08.712 --> 01:03:09.412]  He's bad.
[01:03:10.992 --> 01:03:17.674]  Fury after CNN refers to Uber Eats driver's death during carjacking by teen girls as accident.
[01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:19.194]  And don't worry.
[01:03:21.823 --> 01:03:23.168]  The mayor has now come out.
[01:03:24.082 --> 01:03:29.766]  And said, indeed, it was his fault, the mayor of D.C., the same one that told the police to stand down at the Capitol.
[01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:30.866]  And look at New York.
[01:03:31.027 --> 01:03:41.633]  Anti-Asian racism, violence, stirs fears, rallies in Metro Detroit, New York, and other cities where they say it's rallies against white supremacism.
[01:03:41.914 --> 01:03:42.194]  That's right.
[01:03:42.214 --> 01:03:43.555]  Let's look at the white supremacists.
[01:03:43.575 --> 01:03:53.221]  Here they are, the last six black males and one black woman, I guess, arrested for being white supremacists and attacking Asians.
[01:03:54.912 --> 01:03:56.653]  And let's look at this little girl.
[01:03:56.733 --> 01:04:01.976]  Teenage boy, guns down, 8th grade girl in Virginia attacked.
[01:04:04.337 --> 01:04:06.879]  Her name was Lucy Whalen Burmer.
[01:04:06.899 --> 01:04:11.221]  13-year-old girl shot dead by juvenile thug while walking in Virginia suburb.
[01:04:12.002 --> 01:04:12.882]  Because she was white.
[01:04:13.302 --> 01:04:15.364]  Shot in the back repeatedly.
[01:04:16.377 --> 01:04:22.244]  But I mean, you know what they say on The View, you know what they say on MSNBC, whites are inherently evil.
[01:04:22.965 --> 01:04:29.173]  And so this little girl that ran a little truck farm with her parents, little blue-collar girl, should have paid reparations, lady!
[01:04:29.593 --> 01:04:31.235]  Should have given those guys your shoes!
[01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:33.197]  Should've given them your shirt.
[01:04:33.257 --> 01:04:40.402]  By the way, I've got articles here about all these other people getting shot and being killed where they walk up and say, give me a dollar if you don't.
[01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:40.922]  Boom!
[01:04:41.062 --> 01:04:41.523]  In the head.
[01:04:42.023 --> 01:04:45.465]  And nobody helps because they're white and they deserve it.
[01:04:45.485 --> 01:04:46.586]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.207]  So let me just give you a newsflash.
[01:04:48.427 --> 01:04:53.111]  I love everybody and I want to work with everybody and I'm not going to buy into hating people because of the color of their skin because of this.
[01:04:53.351 --> 01:04:54.472]  This is the globalist triggering this.
[01:04:54.672 --> 01:04:56.974]  But I'm going to explain something to white people and Asians.
[01:04:57.874 --> 01:05:03.281]  If you go in a predominant liberal black neighborhood, you might as well just go jump off a cliff.
[01:05:05.163 --> 01:05:05.764]  You're crazy.
[01:05:06.752 --> 01:05:11.035]  Because it doesn't matter if 95% of the black people aren't racist.
[01:05:11.095 --> 01:05:14.477]  The 5% believe you deserve to die because the media told them.
[01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:16.919]  And you see all the Hollywood shows about attacking whites.
[01:05:17.199 --> 01:05:21.742]  And you now have the curriculum statewide teaching white genocide is good.
[01:05:22.262 --> 01:05:24.123]  So the left tells you white genocide doesn't exist.
[01:05:24.323 --> 01:05:34.290]  The official California curriculum, starting now, in textbooks, is that whites are inherently bad and need to be genocided and Aztec prayers are good.
[01:05:36.374 --> 01:05:37.234]  To the devil, basically.
[01:05:37.535 --> 01:05:38.875]  Oh, that's not their culture, the devil.
[01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:40.897]  A winged serpent they feed hearts to.
[01:05:41.217 --> 01:05:42.898]  Okay, that's the devil, okay.
[01:05:43.778 --> 01:05:47.000]  It's just a winged serpent you feed hearts of children to, come on.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:47.821]  That's not the devil.
[01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:49.301]  That's not in their cosmology.
[01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:49.842]  Okay.
[01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:51.283]  Yeah, right.
[01:05:51.903 --> 01:05:52.203]  Sure.
[01:05:52.223 --> 01:05:55.685]  It's the same damn creature in every ancient mythology.
[01:05:56.025 --> 01:05:56.966]  Because it's real.
[01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.067]  And it wants children's blood.
[01:05:59.407 --> 01:06:00.768]  All children, regardless of what color.
[01:06:01.228 --> 01:06:01.869]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:03.690]  These roving gangs are still dangerous.
[01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:12.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we are back broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, March 29th, 2021 transmission.
[01:06:14.302 --> 01:06:26.568]  And so, we see the UN using its weapon of shutting off the third world, having a total lockdown still ongoing in the Caribbean, still ongoing in most Latin American countries, still ongoing in Asia, going on in Africa.
[01:06:26.908 --> 01:06:31.170]  All the dictators, all the plutocrats, all the oligarchs, they love
[01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:35.673]  The UN directed martial law, because most of them are on IMF and World Bank money.
[01:06:36.013 --> 01:06:38.495]  Most of them have put their own countries into hock to them.
[01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:41.857]  And so the UN is in control of the whole planet.
[01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:43.138]  It's in control of the United States.
[01:06:43.178 --> 01:06:49.423]  The UN directs our medicine, our policies in schooling, education, life and death.
[01:06:49.663 --> 01:06:51.144]  Everything is now the UN.
[01:06:51.184 --> 01:06:54.946]  You wake up and you're inside the New World Order, because they got rid of President Trump.
[01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:56.488]  They were able to implement the whole thing.
[01:06:56.808 --> 01:06:58.129]  Trump went along with a lot of it, by the way.
[01:06:58.888 --> 01:07:00.689]  But now we got Joe Biden to deal with.
[01:07:01.449 --> 01:07:04.431]  So, let's cover these as they go.
[01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:11.074]  Remember, Obama knowingly placed tens of thousands of children with child traffickers, human smugglers.
[01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:13.095]  That's the Senate report, Washington Post.
[01:07:13.115 --> 01:07:13.535]  Just remember that.
[01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:14.656]  Now that's from five years ago.
[01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:16.677]  Here is this new information.
[01:07:17.277 --> 01:07:22.379]  FBI waives background checks requiring for those housing unaccompanied minors.
[01:07:22.419 --> 01:07:23.060]  Translate that.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.042]  You fly into the country, you've got to have your passport, who you are.
[01:07:26.062 --> 01:07:27.703]  You've got to show your children are yours.
[01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:30.846]  That's totally reasonable, because a country can control its borders.
[01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:32.927]  That's in the Constitution.
[01:07:34.568 --> 01:07:41.814]  But instead, oh, you're going to have to have domestic passports to go to a ball game, to get your hair cut, to go to a grocery store.
[01:07:41.834 --> 01:07:46.338]  You're going to have to have a face scan, you're going to have to have a QR code that activates your face scan.
[01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:53.832]  But oh, the border's gonna be wide open, and we're gonna have 168,000 people caught in the last month.
[01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.494]  Close to half of them underage children.
[01:07:58.934 --> 01:08:06.398]  And now, imagine who they didn't catch, and now we're just gonna give them, without any ID, any name, anything, process them through, maybe take a photo of them.
[01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:20.075]  On average, they're processing them every seven hours, and then just releasing them onto buses, just like under Obama, but on a scale, I don't know how many times bigger, but it is much, much bigger.
[01:08:20.936 --> 01:08:25.800]  FBI waives background check requirements for those housing unaccompanied minors.
[01:08:27.142 --> 01:08:33.466]  The Democrats have reportedly argued that universal background checks are a way of ensuring law-abiding Americans can purchase firearms.
[01:08:33.806 --> 01:08:42.891]  While spewing the very false rhetoric out of their mouth, the Biden administration is rolling back requirements for caregivers taking in unaccompanied minors.
[01:08:43.852 --> 01:08:53.298]  So the same folks that sent COVID-19 patients with the flu and other things in to cause more than half the deaths in places like New York are now going to continue the caregiving.
[01:08:53.858 --> 01:08:55.379]  Aw, look at the little boy!
[01:08:57.534 --> 01:09:00.675]  Look at the little baby, not even two years old, he's gonna be just handed over to somebody.
[01:09:02.956 --> 01:09:17.541]  The Biden administration is utilizing tent camps, convention centers, Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and border facilities, as well as other large facilities to house the record number of unaccompanied minors that are flocking across the border in order to quickly staff these facilities.
[01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:24.143]  The FBI is no longer requiring fingerprint background checks for those being employed at these facilities, the Associated Press reported.
[01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.204]  Oh, so when six months ago Biden said,
[01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:36.014]  You've got until I get elected and then you need to surge the border, immediately surge it to overwhelm it so we can do this.
[01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:39.356]  And they're also saying 26 children per foster home.
[01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:43.478]  And they don't have to do background checks either.
[01:09:45.278 --> 01:09:49.240]  Staff and volunteers directly caring for children at new emergency sites.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.682]  But oh, you can't have Senator Ted Cruz go in.
[01:09:54.183 --> 01:09:56.364]  You can't have Senator Ted Cruz go in.
[01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:00.380]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.440]  And then, of course, the Democrats get the children.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.021]  They sign them up for all forms of welfare.
[01:10:04.181 --> 01:10:07.061]  Oh, if they're disabled, suddenly they get a lot more money.
[01:10:07.482 --> 01:10:10.802]  This is pure, unmitigated, absolute evil.
[01:10:11.843 --> 01:10:20.765]  So they create the crisis, offer the solution, break the border, make the Democrats fabulously rich, create a new voting bloc they control, a new group they can milk for taxpayer money.
[01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:27.007]  And then when Senator Cruz of Texas goes in and tries to videotape it,
[01:10:28.655 --> 01:10:33.318]  Something that AOC and others got tours with their cameras of, totally clean, totally nice.
[01:10:34.879 --> 01:10:36.800]  The children have been doing the stupid distancing.
[01:10:37.741 --> 01:10:39.322]  All that's gone, but that's okay.
[01:10:39.582 --> 01:10:41.083]  Here's Senator Ted Cruz being confronted.
[01:10:43.999 --> 01:10:45.560]  Please give dignity to the people.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.062]  Please give dignity to the people.
[01:10:47.102 --> 01:10:53.307]  So you work for the commissioner, your senior advisor, you were hired two weeks ago, and you're instructed to ask us to not have any pictures taken here.
[01:10:53.327 --> 01:10:54.348]  Please respect the people, the rules.
[01:10:54.368 --> 01:10:58.131]  Because the political leadership at DHS does not want the American people to know it.
[01:10:58.171 --> 01:10:59.151]  Please respect the rules, sir.
[01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:01.774]  You keep standing in front of the pictures, so you don't want the pictures taken.
[01:11:01.794 --> 01:11:02.294]  Please respect the rules.
[01:11:02.654 --> 01:11:05.116]  The rules are arbitrary and they're designed to keep the American people in the dark.
[01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.058]  Please respect the rules and give the people dignity and respect.
[01:11:07.518 --> 01:11:08.119]  That's all we ask.
[01:11:08.339 --> 01:11:09.080]  Well, no, it's not.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.141]  You're asking, is this dignity and respect?
[01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:12.062]  Look at these people.
[01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.463]  There's a pandemic.
[01:11:13.683 --> 01:11:14.604]  Let me ask you.
[01:11:14.644 --> 01:11:16.505]  There's a pandemic.
[01:11:16.726 --> 01:11:17.646]  There is a pandemic.
[01:11:17.746 --> 01:11:20.108]  Is this respecting the rights of these kids?
[01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.770]  Are you respecting the rights of these kids?
[01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:24.412]  You're right.
[01:11:24.912 --> 01:11:27.114]  And this is a dangerous place.
[01:11:27.234 --> 01:11:30.436]  And your policies, unfortunately, are trying to hide them.
[01:11:30.517 --> 01:11:31.557]  I understand you were instructed.
[01:11:32.818 --> 01:11:35.340]  I asked you to please respect the people.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.741]  Give them dignity and respect.
[01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:37.641]  We all want to fix this.
[01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:39.222]  We don't want this to happen anymore.
[01:11:48.946 --> 01:11:51.868]  Radical Liberation Theology, CIA program at a U.S.
[01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:54.910]  University, that America's evil, this is part of a rebellion.
[01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:56.511]  He says surge the border.
[01:11:56.951 --> 01:11:57.732]  They all do this.
[01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.033]  They all milk these people.
[01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:04.657]  The coyotes keep them a hundred, you know, or sometimes more, inside these tractor trailers.
[01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:06.258]  If they don't pay their money, they kill them.
[01:12:06.518 --> 01:12:09.680]  It's not even a footnote when 25 dead found in this trailer.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.622]  75 found, half dead, 20 of them dead in this trailer.
[01:12:13.002 --> 01:12:14.303]  A bunch of kids found dead here.
[01:12:14.383 --> 01:12:16.785]  Mass grave, over 200 women and children found.
[01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:18.586]  It just barely makes the local paper.
[01:12:19.406 --> 01:12:20.027]  But whoo!
[01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:24.710]  Some Islamic goes in and kills 10 white people and Obama says it's white supremacy!
[01:12:27.652 --> 01:12:29.894]  It's white supremacy!
[01:12:31.895 --> 01:12:32.776]  And misogyny!
[01:12:33.196 --> 01:12:36.118]  What does that even have to do with reality?
[01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.620]  It's the Pied Piper, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:43.423]  So that's where we are, and where are the states?
[01:12:43.903 --> 01:12:44.844]  Where is the Attorney General?
[01:12:44.904 --> 01:12:45.945]  Oh, he's an Obama guy too?
[01:12:47.554 --> 01:12:50.317]  This is the takeover of our country.
[01:12:50.657 --> 01:12:52.319]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.744]  And I'm going to come back and I'm going to show you just a smattering from today.
[01:12:58.985 --> 01:13:04.891]  The last few days of whites and Asians being killed by black gangs.
[01:13:07.714 --> 01:13:16.080]  And it's a phenomenon of young people doing it, and they tell them, die you white piece of garbage, die you such and such, and the media covers it up.
[01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:24.346]  If the media said it was wrong, if the media said it was bad, like when the KKK was randomly killing black people, people would turn against it and stop it.
[01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:30.191]  But instead, it's taught that whites deserve to die, and the official California, well you guys reprinted that, you're awesome.
[01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:31.111]  That was from Friday.
[01:13:31.352 --> 01:13:36.896]  California's official curriculum teaches that there needs to be a white genocide.
[01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:40.611]  To counter the white genocide of earlier.
[01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:44.034]  Oh yeah, if you didn't help the Native Americans kill the other tribes, they'd kill your ass.
[01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:46.556]  They were just as bloodthirsty than anybody else.
[01:13:46.576 --> 01:13:48.097]  In fact, probably more so.
[01:13:48.998 --> 01:13:50.119]  And I'm part Native American.
[01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:51.460]  Just give me a break!
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.221]  Watch the movie The Revenant.
[01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:54.863]  That's based on a true story and a real guy.
[01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.004]  It's much worse than that if you read the actual real story.
[01:13:57.505 --> 01:14:01.168]  He later got killed by the tribes up there on that river.
[01:14:02.537 --> 01:14:04.519]  Go watch The Revenant, how sweet the Native Americans are.
[01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:09.905]  Yeah, one guy's nice, saves his life, because the other tribe had shot him and he was against them.
[01:14:10.165 --> 01:14:10.866]  That's how it worked.
[01:14:11.426 --> 01:14:15.911]  But if he was with the wrong tribe, the Leonardo DiCaprio character was a real guy, they'd have killed him!
[01:14:15.931 --> 01:14:18.434]  It's all tribal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:20.236]  So you watch that movie.
[01:14:20.596 --> 01:14:22.778]  One native loves him, the other natives want to kill him.
[01:14:23.119 --> 01:14:24.020]  That's how it really works.
[01:14:26.237 --> 01:14:33.495]  And that's why anybody in Missouri or Texas or Tennessee or any of these old states where the real Indian War has happened up to Illinois, if your family was here when it all started...
[01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:41.919]  You're related to Native Americans, because women died on the frontier a lot faster than men, just because it was rough out there.
[01:14:41.939 --> 01:14:44.681]  Women are physically tougher, but not in the frontier situation.
[01:14:45.121 --> 01:14:51.545]  And so the average person that lived to be 75 or so, I had like great-great-great-great-grandfathers and stuff that had like six wives by the time they died.
[01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:53.346]  They were having kids when they were 85 years old.
[01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:57.069]  I had great-great-great-great-grandfathers that had like 37 kids and stuff like that.
[01:14:57.609 --> 01:14:58.690]  And you know, half of them would die.
[01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.071]  You know the cemeteries?
[01:15:00.091 --> 01:15:01.451]  We've got family cemeteries in East Texas.
[01:15:01.772 --> 01:15:04.093]  Half the people in there are kids and women.
[01:15:04.553 --> 01:15:06.855]  It's all real low death rates.
[01:15:08.055 --> 01:15:09.877]  Three years old, five years old, two years old.
[01:15:09.897 --> 01:15:10.377]  It was rough.
[01:15:10.997 --> 01:15:12.378]  It was rough, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:13.339]  It was rough.
[01:15:13.899 --> 01:15:17.641]  Oh, but now because there were a bunch of wars over this country, everybody wants to get into now.
[01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:19.542]  Let's genocide the white people.
[01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:20.303]  Give me a break.
[01:15:21.869 --> 01:15:30.476]  Well, all I see is brown people that have, quote, Native American lineage and Spanish lineage trying to get into America because it's not racist and it's not evil and it's not bad.
[01:15:30.496 --> 01:15:34.039]  And that's why the globalists want it to fall and want to bring it down.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.300]  We'll be right back!
[01:15:35.401 --> 01:15:37.622]  I'm Alex Jones, fighting back!
[01:15:39.604 --> 01:15:46.130]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, so let's continue exposing what the mainstream media doesn't want you to know.
[01:15:47.605 --> 01:15:54.267]  Remember, they fought on Facebook and on Twitter and on YouTube to block the Islamic jihadi killer.
[01:15:55.287 --> 01:16:01.389]  He and his father, big fans of ISIS, big fans of al-Nusra, and big enemies of America.
[01:16:01.469 --> 01:16:04.570]  So they were all here, of course, living off the American people.
[01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:07.291]  And he went in and shot and killed 10 white people because he didn't like them.
[01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:09.612]  And he told people at the school, I'm going to kill white people.
[01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:12.933]  I'm going to kill you, whenever he lost to white students in wrestling.
[01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:18.186]  So, Obama said that was a white supremacist attack, and they still say that in the news.
[01:16:18.226 --> 01:16:24.629]  The ADL says it, Southern Poverty Law Center says it, and Snope says that was a white supremacist and misogynistic attack.
[01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:27.590]  Because whatever Obama says is true.
[01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:29.950]  He's the guy that started the giant human smuggling program.
[01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:31.891]  Many of the children end up dead or disappeared.
[01:16:31.971 --> 01:16:35.832]  That's okay, though, because, again, Obama is at least partially black, supposedly.
[01:16:36.012 --> 01:16:38.253]  So, Tim Cook's gay, he can run big death camps in China.
[01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:39.614]  So you understand how this works now.
[01:16:41.567 --> 01:16:45.149]  Teenage boy guns down 8th grade girl in Virginia attacked.
[01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:48.231]  And I went and read the police reports and all of this.
[01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:55.015]  It says that the youth, several young black males that shot her to death in the back because she was white.
[01:16:56.172 --> 01:16:59.713]  They'll probably serve two years in juvenile and be released.
[01:16:59.933 --> 01:17:01.154]  And let's tell you her name.
[01:17:01.214 --> 01:17:10.137]  Her name was Lucia Whalen Burmer, 13-year-old girl shot dead by juvenile thug while walking in Virginia suburb.
[01:17:10.157 --> 01:17:14.139]  None of the local media will even tell you that he was black.
[01:17:14.279 --> 01:17:16.180]  And I guess, what was he, 16 years old?
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:24.283]  Lucia Whalen Burmer, a 13-year-old girl described by those who knew her as brave, hardworking,
[01:17:25.256 --> 01:17:36.805]  And kind to everyone, was reportedly shot dead while walking in Virginia's suburb on Friday by a thug suspect who may get off easy and have his identity hidden forever because he's a juvenile.
[01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:43.810]  A boy has been arrested in connection with a shooting that killed the eighth grade girl in Virginia, a day long manhunt.
[01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:49.315]  Loved ones identified the victim as Lucia Wayland-Bermer, a student at the middle school in Richmond.
[01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:56.298]  She was shot multiple times Friday afternoon at the Gayton Forest West Subdivision and died at the area hospital soon after.
[01:17:56.578 --> 01:18:02.620]  Police said the suspect shooter fled the scene immediately after opening fire and was arrested on Saturday afternoon about a half mile away.
[01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:06.041]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:08.262]  Now, let's look at this case.
[01:18:08.302 --> 01:18:09.363]  We can show you some video of this.
[01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:14.745]  Black teen given anger management after killing 59-year-old white man with sucker punch.
[01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:27.402]  Two black Maryland teenagers found guilty of killing a middle-aged white man via sucker punch at a county fair were let off by the presiding judge with lenient sentences of probation and anger management.
[01:18:28.082 --> 01:18:30.544]  They punched him when he wouldn't give them a dollar, knocking him down.
[01:18:30.584 --> 01:18:32.365]  He busted his head open and died.
[01:18:32.385 --> 01:18:34.046]  And the judge is like, hey, he's white.
[01:18:34.466 --> 01:18:35.827]  Goodbye, Nazi.
[01:18:36.927 --> 01:18:37.708]  So there you go.
[01:18:37.808 --> 01:18:40.529]  Anger management for that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:42.651]  So that's how it works.
[01:18:43.973 --> 01:18:49.116]  I mean, in the old days, I had a guy one time bash my head in the concrete.
[01:18:49.136 --> 01:18:50.736]  He probably weighed 80 pounds bigger than me.
[01:18:51.337 --> 01:19:00.441]  I got up, hit him five or six times, knocked him down, and he fell over some stuff, hit his head, busted open.
[01:19:01.261 --> 01:19:06.024]  He became in a coma for a while, then was mentally retarded after that, partially.
[01:19:06.852 --> 01:19:08.175]  And they tried all the stuff.
[01:19:08.195 --> 01:19:09.458]  They had the police arrest me, everything.
[01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.261]  Even though there were witnesses, he attacked me.
[01:19:11.602 --> 01:19:13.346]  Just because he was in a coma, they arrested me.
[01:19:13.606 --> 01:19:14.628]  But see, that was white on white.
[01:19:17.748 --> 01:19:20.089]  If it's black-on-white, baby, there's nothing gonna happen.
[01:19:20.369 --> 01:19:24.210]  Just like the Hispanic illegal alien that shot the white woman to death in San Francisco.
[01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:28.611]  And the jury said, releasing, you're allowed to kill the white people.
[01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:32.072]  You cannot have a brown person do wrong.
[01:19:32.312 --> 01:19:36.753]  Therefore, if you can't have a bunch of brown children, and give them to brown people or whoever, it's okay.
[01:19:38.613 --> 01:19:40.994]  And here it is, Fury, after CNN refuses,
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:51.464]  To report on the racial attack and refers to Uber Eats driver's death during carjacking by teen girls as an accident.
[01:19:51.484 --> 01:19:52.825]  15 and 13 with a taser.
[01:19:53.225 --> 01:19:57.407]  They get in and start tasering him repeatedly.
[01:19:57.808 --> 01:20:00.589]  He mashes on the gas, goes and crashes, dies.
[01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:11.915]  And the mayor, far left DC mayor Muriel Bowser, blames victim of carjacking and brutal murder by teenage girls
[01:20:13.346 --> 01:20:13.867]  on him.
[01:20:14.707 --> 01:20:15.988]  Yes, we're going to show you that in a moment.
[01:20:16.168 --> 01:20:19.491]  But with audio, go ahead and roll the carjacking caught on tape.
[01:20:43.135 --> 01:20:45.015]  She's stealing their car.
[01:20:45.156 --> 01:20:49.096]  She's stealing the car?
[01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:53.798]  Yeah, he stole the car.
[01:20:53.818 --> 01:20:54.918]  Now what does the mayor say?
[01:20:54.938 --> 01:20:58.519]  What does the mayor say?
[01:20:58.579 --> 01:20:59.699]  It's his fault.
[01:20:59.839 --> 01:21:00.299]  No kidding.
[01:21:00.339 --> 01:21:01.239]  Play the video if you'd like.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.420]  It's me fault!
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:04.140]  It's me fault!
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:11.602]  Think of the soullessness of the Democrats and the globalists trying to create this race war.
[01:21:13.712 --> 01:21:15.875]  Now there's the girls climbing out of the car.
[01:21:15.895 --> 01:21:18.659]  The car rolled over on him, killed him.
[01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:19.440]  They stole the car!
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.101]  They stole the car!
[01:21:20.121 --> 01:21:21.022]  There they are, escaping.
[01:21:21.302 --> 01:21:22.464]  That's it!
[01:21:22.484 --> 01:21:22.764]  That's it!
[01:21:22.784 --> 01:21:23.285]  That's it!
[01:21:23.305 --> 01:21:23.605]  That's it!
[01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:25.488]  Oh, the military's saving the girls.
[01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:27.270]  They're wearing their little face masks.
[01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:28.212]  Look at the martial law.
[01:21:28.732 --> 01:21:29.774]  Troops on the street.
[01:21:29.794 --> 01:21:30.935]  There's the guy dead on the street.
[01:21:32.025 --> 01:21:32.806]  Look at him, he's dead!
[01:21:33.826 --> 01:21:36.248]  And they're all victims, and the troops are saving him.
[01:21:36.468 --> 01:21:41.752]  They probably thought because he wasn't black that he was a terrorist.
[01:21:41.792 --> 01:21:42.973]  Doesn't this tell you everything?
[01:21:43.213 --> 01:21:48.477]  A city under martial law, troops on the streets, carjackings going on.
[01:21:50.097 --> 01:21:54.780]  And they're now trying to suppress the race crime statistic numbers, but... Black on white, 547,943.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:55.541]  Black on Hispanic, 112,365.
[01:21:56.081 --> 01:21:56.521]  White on black, 59,778.
[01:21:56.601 --> 01:21:57.262]  White on Hispanic, 207,000.
[01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:10.391]  104.
[01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:10.391]  Hispanic on white, 365,299.
[01:22:10.891 --> 01:22:11.852]  Hispanic on black, 44,551.
[01:22:11.952 --> 01:22:13.573]  Now, you look at those two statistics.
[01:22:13.593 --> 01:22:15.495]  Who's getting attacked in this country?
[01:22:15.515 --> 01:22:15.795]  White people.
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.600]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:32.942]  The average white man I see out there looks like an emaciated zombie who walks like a girl and acts all wimpy on purpose.
[01:22:33.222 --> 01:22:38.363]  So, number one, white people are a bunch of cowardly weirdos who've been taught it's cool to act like that.
[01:22:38.403 --> 01:22:39.283]  We're so domesticated.
[01:22:39.763 --> 01:22:42.443]  Just like the once mighty British are now a bunch of domesticated weirdos.
[01:22:42.663 --> 01:22:44.564]  Not all of them, but most.
[01:22:44.684 --> 01:22:46.084]  But it's taught everywhere else.
[01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:50.325]  It's cool to be aggressive, but you gotta feed on white people.
[01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:52.281]  And so that's just the truth!
[01:22:53.322 --> 01:22:59.323]  And so that's where we are, and that's why the media has all this, oh epidemic of the white people, and they're killing everybody in their bed!
[01:23:00.764 --> 01:23:15.448]  Yes, this is a perfect example of the Vice Show that shows the woman with her four husbands, and of course later one of them tried to kill the other ones and went to jail, and there was an attack, and I mean this is the model of what the globalists
[01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:17.399]  I don't think so.
[01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:37.226]  That will call out their gaslighting and their propaganda.
[01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:39.669]  That's why thank you for sponsoring us as the listeners.
[01:23:39.689 --> 01:23:45.334]  They took most of our sponsors away over the years with threats and everything else, but we've got great affiliates that stand against the threats.
[01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:49.879]  We've got you that stand with us, so please support the local affiliates and please...
[01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:57.079]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get a F. Biden shirt, an F. Mask shirt, or an F. Fauci.
[01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:59.642]  And I'm not normally into crash things, but people love this type of stuff.
[01:23:59.662 --> 01:24:00.483]  It's just F.K.
[01:24:00.743 --> 01:24:01.364]  and then Biden.
[01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:02.065]  F.K.
[01:24:02.105 --> 01:24:02.425]  Mask.
[01:24:02.586 --> 01:24:02.926]  F.K.
[01:24:03.046 --> 01:24:03.426]  Fauci.
[01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:06.870]  Folks really like them, and they're bestsellers.
[01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:08.272]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:09.333]  We have free shipping.
[01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:33.010]  On Brain Force Plus, Dr. Jones Natural Concentrated Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, and the mouthwash, and the Cabba's Chill, and Extra Strength Cabba's Chill, and all Emrix Essentials, with the essential oils, 15 types of essential oils, super high quality organic, the... Well, they've got it all.
[01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:38.994]  I mean, there's a whole line of organic self-care products, the shampoo, the body wash,
[01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:40.844]  We're good to go.
[01:25:02.401 --> 01:25:02.841]  I don't know.
[01:25:29.622 --> 01:25:35.864]  Mr. Dent joining us, Harry Dent of harrydent.com to talk about the global financial implosion that's been designed.
[01:25:36.404 --> 01:25:41.086]  We've got Owen Schroer popping in for a couple of segments from the crisis on the border.
[01:25:42.306 --> 01:25:46.368]  And then, the one, the only, Gerald Celente in the fourth hour today.
[01:25:46.968 --> 01:25:50.990]  Again, the only way people learn about this broadcast is you in the information war.
[01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:54.811]  The globalists win if you don't spread the word and share this live feed.
[01:25:55.051 --> 01:25:56.111]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:57.572]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:25:58.432 --> 01:26:04.638]  EU reports 3,964 killed by COVID vaccines.
[01:26:05.279 --> 01:26:09.023]  The EU admits 3,964 people have died from the vaccines.
[01:26:09.763 --> 01:26:12.486]  And they haven't updated the numbers in a few weeks, so it's going to be much higher.
[01:26:12.506 --> 01:26:13.487]  162,000 plus got injured.
[01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:35.162]  And that's when it became very clear that the decision we made on January the 10th to go all out and develop a vaccine, we have a number of vaccine candidates, may have been the best decision that I've ever made with regard to an intervention as the Director of the Institute.
[01:26:35.342 --> 01:26:36.403]  Here's another one, Bloomberg!
[01:26:37.248 --> 01:26:39.729]  Op-Ed, we must start planning for a permanent pandemic.
[01:26:40.389 --> 01:26:44.550]  Never stop masks, never stop inoculations, never stop being non-essential.
[01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:45.330]  And why not?
[01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:46.910]  Bloomberg is again almost double his money.
[01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:47.931]  They're in the lockdown.
[01:26:47.951 --> 01:26:48.511]  It's a takeover.
[01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:51.411]  Of course, no pandemic goes on forever.
[01:26:51.651 --> 01:26:53.732]  At some point in time, the pandemic will pass.
[01:26:54.252 --> 01:27:02.154]  But it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal.
[01:27:03.061 --> 01:27:03.782]  Brace yourselves.
[01:27:04.063 --> 01:27:10.792]  Globally, it's looking like it's going to be a little over seven years until we can reach that 75% immunity.
[01:27:10.832 --> 01:27:11.233]  I know.
[01:27:11.253 --> 01:27:15.519]  I think it's politically unrealistic to expect the governments to backtrack now.
[01:27:15.579 --> 01:27:17.962]  They've invested too much of themselves in it.
[01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:30.306]  So, although the ideal would be to revert to a voluntary system, which was what the authorities all recommended before last March, I don't think that that is going to happen.
[01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:34.247]  And I have to say that I'm extremely pessimistic about this.
[01:27:35.267 --> 01:27:41.829]  An interesting parallel is the continuation of wartime food rationing after the last war.
[01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:46.223]  People were in favour of that because they were in favour of social control.
[01:27:46.243 --> 01:27:47.864]  They'd had a lot of it during the war.
[01:27:47.924 --> 01:27:49.326]  They thought that this was an answer.
[01:27:50.387 --> 01:28:01.498]  In the 1950 and 51 general elections, the Labour Party lost its majority entirely because people with five years more experience of social control got fed up with it.
[01:28:02.139 --> 01:28:04.481]  Sooner or later, that will happen in this country.
[01:28:05.522 --> 01:28:10.805]  Supreme Court judge in the UK says it will last at least 10 years.
[01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.506]  See, it's all being announced now.
[01:28:12.546 --> 01:28:14.346]  I told you over a year ago, it never ends.
[01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:19.949]  First it's 15 days, 2 months, 6 months, a year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, and then it's forever.
[01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:22.030]  With everything else that comes with it.
[01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:25.492]  The tyranny we live under is called medicalization.
[01:28:25.872 --> 01:28:30.554]  It is a technocracy that uses medicalization to take full control of society.
[01:28:30.735 --> 01:28:31.395]  And here's what's scary.
[01:28:33.019 --> 01:28:35.401]  Everybody acts like they're so smart that they're professionals.
[01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:36.822]  Doctors, scientists, lawyers.
[01:28:36.882 --> 01:28:39.003]  They don't study any of how it all works.
[01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:44.687]  They don't study the founts, the progenitors, the designers.
[01:28:45.207 --> 01:28:45.547]  I do.
[01:28:45.948 --> 01:28:48.389]  And they tell you they're so arrogant what the plan is!
[01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:58.636]  I think an epidemic, either naturally caused or intentionally caused, is the most likely thing to cause, say, 10 million excess deaths.
[01:29:00.237 --> 01:29:04.461]  And that it's pretty surprising how little preparedness there is for it.
[01:29:05.041 --> 01:29:07.924]  Now, it's tricky because this is a global problem.
[01:29:08.024 --> 01:29:10.446]  So, you know, how do countries work together?
[01:29:10.986 --> 01:29:13.228]  Which countries should put up what resources?
[01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:15.009]  3,900 plus dead from the vaccine.
[01:29:15.069 --> 01:29:17.351]  But Gates told us 700,000 will get sick or die.
[01:29:17.411 --> 01:29:20.794]  He told us 80% would get really sick.
[01:29:26.007 --> 01:29:35.795]  And it doesn't even protect us, and now they say, you gotta take 10 vaccines a year, it was 5 vaccines a year, and that you still gotta wear a mask, and you're still non-essential, and that it's a great thing.
[01:29:36.276 --> 01:29:51.429]  I can just look at this from a military perspective, a engineering perspective, a societal perspective, a cultural perspective, a religious perspective, a spiritual perspective, a physical perspective, and tell you, this is the end of us.
[01:29:54.286 --> 01:29:54.906]  All right, folks.
[01:29:55.146 --> 01:29:55.987]  Welcome back.
[01:29:56.027 --> 01:29:57.347]  That's a very important report.
[01:29:57.488 --> 01:29:59.288]  EU vaccine death count explodes.
[01:29:59.388 --> 01:30:01.870]  Wow, it just went live a few hours ago.
[01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:03.811]  EU vaccine death counts explode.
[01:30:03.851 --> 01:30:04.871]  It's at Band.video.
[01:30:05.171 --> 01:30:15.416]  Please, for all your safety, all our safety, if you live in Florida or Texas, you think you're safe in South Dakota, they're rolling it out that once they have all the other cities and counties and countries, they're coming for us.
[01:30:15.776 --> 01:30:17.217]  But we've got to hold the line now.
[01:30:17.237 --> 01:30:21.299]  We've got to fight them there to stop it before we have to fight them here politically to stop it.
[01:30:21.559 --> 01:30:22.960]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroeder.
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.380]  Stay with us.
[01:30:26.323 --> 01:30:27.443]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:30:27.484 --> 01:30:29.444]  Welcome back into hour number three.
[01:30:29.464 --> 01:30:35.467]  We have an economist and author joining us to break down where the world economy really is and where it's going.
[01:30:35.507 --> 01:30:39.149]  It's pretty frightening stuff, but knowing ahead of time is really good.
[01:30:39.469 --> 01:30:50.474]  Well, Owen Schroyer has been hooked up with us about five minutes, and I've been watching him down on the South Texas border with 18 Wheeler after 18 Wheeler going into the facility, going out of the facility.
[01:30:51.414 --> 01:30:57.457]  He is currently at the Donna Migrant Facility 2, where they're building a whole bunch of big facilities up front.
[01:30:57.877 --> 01:31:04.120]  They have enough facilities to hold reportedly 4,000 people in the back, but they're building it up to hold an additional 10,000.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:08.362]  Then they're going to go to another facility a few miles away that can hold 10,000 as well.
[01:31:08.402 --> 01:31:15.245]  They're building these all over the place on top of all the facilities that Trump built and what Obama built.
[01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:18.806]  But the media says, The Washington Post, there is no surge.
[01:31:20.427 --> 01:31:23.610]  We're going to have Owen out in a boat on the Rio Grande.
[01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:25.552]  Same place that Ted Cruz has been.
[01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:27.934]  Same place Trump is going to be there today or tomorrow.
[01:31:28.595 --> 01:31:29.816]  We were hearing from inside sources.
[01:31:29.856 --> 01:31:31.517]  We'll see if that materializes.
[01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:34.280]  So, Owen, you've already filed some reports that will be at Bandot Video.
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:42.427]  You'll be hosting from a boat in the Rio Grande River in between Mexico and Texas today, coming up during the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:31:42.668 --> 01:31:43.869]  Tell us what you've witnessed so far.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:53.266]  Well, honestly, it's stunning the mass size and scale and scope of this project that we have going on behind me, Alex.
[01:31:53.306 --> 01:32:03.293]  And if they're saying 4,000 to 10,000, they could easily put 50,000, maybe even 100,000 in this facility, especially at the occupation rates and the capacity rates.
[01:32:03.633 --> 01:32:05.413]  That we've seen at the Donna Base Camp.
[01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:08.334]  So this is an entire new facility.
[01:32:08.354 --> 01:32:09.054]  I mean, 50,000?
[01:32:09.094 --> 01:32:09.054]  100,000?
[01:32:09.435 --> 01:32:09.975]  How many people?
[01:32:09.995 --> 01:32:10.735]  There's going to be enough.
[01:32:11.155 --> 01:32:12.215]  And they're building this behind me.
[01:32:12.255 --> 01:32:16.856]  As you said, Alex, we've been here and all day long, work crews have been going in and out.
[01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:17.797]  All day long.
[01:32:17.817 --> 01:32:19.297]  24-7 work crews.
[01:32:19.417 --> 01:32:19.837]  In and out.
[01:32:19.997 --> 01:32:20.437]  In and out.
[01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:21.338]  Cement trucks.
[01:32:21.438 --> 01:32:22.158]  Semi trucks.
[01:32:22.478 --> 01:32:23.278]  FedEx trucks.
[01:32:23.618 --> 01:32:24.238]  Work trucks.
[01:32:24.398 --> 01:32:24.978]  Crew trucks.
[01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:25.999]  Non-stop.
[01:32:26.179 --> 01:32:26.859]  All day long.
[01:32:27.519 --> 01:32:35.305]  And I can't tell if these are going to be permanent or if they're going to be temporary, but it would seem with an undergoing a project of this size that these are going to be permanent.
[01:32:35.585 --> 01:32:41.790]  So they're building a massive invasion center here at Rio Grande and International Boulevard.
[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:43.211]  And I mean, look at this Alex.
[01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:44.151]  This is all day long.
[01:32:44.371 --> 01:32:46.293]  All day long construction crews going in.
[01:32:46.513 --> 01:32:48.214]  All day long cement trucks going in.
[01:32:48.234 --> 01:32:48.554]  Look at this.
[01:32:48.574 --> 01:32:50.456]  We got a bus going in right now.
[01:32:51.036 --> 01:32:53.357]  And it's been all day long with this.
[01:32:53.717 --> 01:32:55.917]  So the plan is pretty clear here, Alex.
[01:32:56.438 --> 01:33:00.779]  Border wide open, surge the border, as Biden said, and then bring all these people in.
[01:33:01.039 --> 01:33:02.799]  There's an apartment complex right here.
[01:33:03.139 --> 01:33:05.820]  There's an apartment complex literally touching this facility.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.260]  Guess what?
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.241]  You now got an invasion center in your backyard.
[01:33:08.561 --> 01:33:11.782]  There's a whole community, a whole neighborhood of people back here.
[01:33:12.262 --> 01:33:14.363]  A whole neighborhood, overnight, bam!
[01:33:14.603 --> 01:33:17.745]  They have an immigration invasion center in their backyard.
[01:33:18.165 --> 01:33:19.105]  Who's paying for this?
[01:33:19.505 --> 01:33:23.907]  This has to be a multi-million dollar project that is going on right now.
[01:33:24.147 --> 01:33:25.788]  Did this come from the stimulus package?
[01:33:26.228 --> 01:33:30.110]  Why are we funding for these projects when we have homeless veterans, homeless Americans?
[01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:33.812]  Why do we have a wide open southern border when we have a welfare state?
[01:33:34.512 --> 01:33:37.493]  And by the way, Owen, Owen, this, I mean, it looks like an anthill.
[01:33:37.753 --> 01:33:42.594]  An 18-wheeler just went in, an 18-wheeler's going out, buses going in, cars pouring in, pouring out.
[01:33:43.515 --> 01:33:45.475]  And again, we've got the satellite photos of this.
[01:33:45.956 --> 01:33:47.996]  They've got a bunch of new stuff being built on the road.
[01:33:48.076 --> 01:33:51.817]  Back behind it is a bunch of operating facilities we've confirmed with our Border Patrol.
[01:33:52.057 --> 01:33:55.078]  And as you said, you're about to go to the main facility later today.
[01:33:56.019 --> 01:33:57.059]  This is a whole new thing.
[01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:58.370]  That's right.
[01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:00.632]  The footage is going up on Bandout Video right now.
[01:34:00.712 --> 01:34:06.637]  If you see, as soon as we went into that main entrance, and this is going up, we got rejected immediately.
[01:34:06.938 --> 01:34:08.039]  We asked a couple questions.
[01:34:08.219 --> 01:34:09.360]  Oh, we can't say anything.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.521]  We don't know what this is for.
[01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:11.602]  We don't know who's funding it.
[01:34:11.882 --> 01:34:14.124]  We just know it's private property and we're going to kick you out.
[01:34:14.504 --> 01:34:17.306]  And I said, hey, man, you know, this is a kind of a big deal at the southern border.
[01:34:17.346 --> 01:34:18.728]  Don't you think the American people should know?
[01:34:18.988 --> 01:34:19.708]  Our tax dollars?
[01:34:19.749 --> 01:34:20.809]  Sorry, private property.
[01:34:20.829 --> 01:34:21.310]  You got to go.
[01:34:21.914 --> 01:34:26.096]  But again, what you're seeing right here is maybe a quarter of the facility.
[01:34:26.597 --> 01:34:27.397]  Maybe a quarter.
[01:34:27.437 --> 01:34:28.578]  This thing goes back.
[01:34:28.978 --> 01:34:32.720]  I mean, it goes back, Alex, like maybe a quarter of a mile even.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.082]  And we went around as much as we could and just filmed all around it.
[01:34:37.442 --> 01:34:40.664]  So the tents that you're seeing here, this is maybe a quarter.
[01:34:40.724 --> 01:34:42.885]  So you see maybe four or five tents here.
[01:34:42.965 --> 01:34:44.886]  I'd say there's probably 20, 25 tents at this facility.
[01:34:46.368 --> 01:34:50.775]  Uh, each tent could maybe hold 4,000 people, especially at the rate we've seen them coming in.
[01:34:51.236 --> 01:34:53.100]  So again, just look at the numbers, Alex.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:53.881]  Look at the numbers.
[01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:54.702]  This is a plan.
[01:34:54.963 --> 01:34:56.526]  This is a planned invasion.
[01:34:57.347 --> 01:35:00.428]  And my guess is, this is all being funded with stimulus money.
[01:35:00.468 --> 01:35:03.029]  So hey, someone owns these private contracts.
[01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:05.230]  Somebody owns these construction crews.
[01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:06.751]  Somebody owns these trucks.
[01:35:07.091 --> 01:35:09.632]  Somebody's making out like a bandit on this deal, Alex.
[01:35:09.952 --> 01:35:11.493]  Somebody's making millions of dollars.
[01:35:11.713 --> 01:35:21.077]  And I think an investigation needs to go into politicians that may be involved with this, because we are funding an invasion, and we're building invasion centers out here in South Texas.
[01:35:22.145 --> 01:35:25.568]  Well, Owen, remember when Obama launched this, it was massive.
[01:35:25.588 --> 01:35:26.829]  They tried to deny it was happening.
[01:35:27.369 --> 01:35:28.570]  Then Trump stopped it.
[01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:30.712]  They called him horrible because he ended the cages.
[01:35:30.732 --> 01:35:32.173]  They actually had nice facilities.
[01:35:32.634 --> 01:35:33.254]  Very nice.
[01:35:33.274 --> 01:35:34.515]  Some were nicer than public schools.
[01:35:34.635 --> 01:35:35.536]  People went to tours.
[01:35:36.337 --> 01:35:41.101]  But AOC tried to lie about it, famously crying at a fence with nobody in it.
[01:35:42.142 --> 01:35:44.483]  But now this is on a scale way above that.
[01:35:44.523 --> 01:35:46.283]  Just like the UN broke Europe's borders.
[01:35:46.704 --> 01:35:50.005]  Just like they built refugee centers on Europe's borders, then organized the people.
[01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:51.685]  This has been organized.
[01:35:51.725 --> 01:35:53.346]  This is by design.
[01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:56.907]  And again, this is mass criminal smuggling at an incredible level.
[01:35:58.243 --> 01:36:00.644]  Well, and Alex, there's no other media here.
[01:36:00.744 --> 01:36:02.424]  I think this is the next big story.
[01:36:03.044 --> 01:36:11.246]  We ran into a French cameraman that was just trying to set up a shot for B-roll, and there's one media truck here with just some satellites, but they don't even have their cameras rolling yet.
[01:36:11.646 --> 01:36:13.707]  So nobody even has this story yet.
[01:36:13.867 --> 01:36:22.209]  A second massive facility being built in Donna, potentially bigger than the first one, and then are they going to use this and say, oh look,
[01:36:22.887 --> 01:36:25.169]  The facility in Donna's not being overwhelmed.
[01:36:25.469 --> 01:36:26.910]  We're not crowding them anymore.
[01:36:27.251 --> 01:36:27.531]  See?
[01:36:27.611 --> 01:36:28.932]  Everything's under control.
[01:36:29.152 --> 01:36:47.447]  Don't look over here, and then all of a sudden they're gonna be sent over here, where they're gonna be stuffed in like sardines, and they're gonna be coming in by the tens of thousands, and then they're gonna be released with no background checks, released with no checks for illness, whether it's something deadly like tuberculosis or the rigged coronavirus, and it's just total onslaught.
[01:36:47.487 --> 01:36:49.829]  And you know, what's really sick about this, Alex,
[01:36:50.307 --> 01:36:51.730]  These people are being used.
[01:36:52.151 --> 01:37:01.771]  These migrants that are truly coming, many of them coming from oppressed countries, blending in with the coyotes, blending in with the sex traffickers that are being allowed to come across this country right now.
[01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:06.185]  Many of them just coming over here thinking, oh, OK, Biden said I'd get a free handout.
[01:37:06.446 --> 01:37:07.506]  So they're just being used.
[01:37:07.726 --> 01:37:09.527]  They're being used as an invasion force.
[01:37:09.788 --> 01:37:17.733]  And then they have to sit in these facilities for who knows how long, with who knows who, until they can just get out and be released into the country.
[01:37:17.953 --> 01:37:18.533]  And then what?
[01:37:18.893 --> 01:37:20.414]  And then who's paying for their lives?
[01:37:20.955 --> 01:37:22.035]  Where are they going to go?
[01:37:22.235 --> 01:37:22.996]  There's no plan.
[01:37:23.536 --> 01:37:25.357]  These people are being used as an invasion force.
[01:37:25.377 --> 01:37:32.299]  This is the most inhumane thing that we've seen going on here when it comes to a migrant invasion happening at the southern border.
[01:37:32.559 --> 01:37:36.501]  And quite frankly, I mean, as I'm looking at the camera, I can just hear the trucks going in and out.
[01:37:36.881 --> 01:37:38.281]  It's been all day since we got here.
[01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:38.641]  In and out.
[01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:39.862]  Like you said, like an anthill.
[01:37:40.102 --> 01:37:42.063]  So this is a massive project.
[01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:42.883]  Massive!
[01:37:43.303 --> 01:37:46.245]  I mean, this is like, if you were about to have, I mean, I'm serious.
[01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:51.807]  If you were about to go around during World War II, and they're building camps and stuff, I imagine that this is what it would be like.
[01:37:52.147 --> 01:37:53.628]  So this is what we're doing to migrants now.
[01:37:53.648 --> 01:37:55.289]  We're saying, hey, come in, free stuff.
[01:37:55.549 --> 01:38:06.114]  And then they get here, they don't know what to do, and they get shoved into these facilities, costing us millions of dollars, packed in like sardines, spreading COVID, spreading tuberculosis, child sex trafficking, all this stuff going on.
[01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:11.017]  And the White House just shrugs its shoulders, just says, oh- I'll tell you why they do, because they're processing them.
[01:38:11.497 --> 01:38:15.160]  In 24 hours illegally putting them on buses with known sex traffickers.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:19.244]  The FBI has waived background checks for who they're giving the children to.
[01:38:19.964 --> 01:38:25.169]  So it's one thing if Obama got caught doing this a few years ago, they are doing it again.
[01:38:25.529 --> 01:38:29.592]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers, Senate report, Washington Post.
[01:38:29.933 --> 01:38:32.395]  Now they're doing it on a galactic grand scale.
[01:38:32.795 --> 01:38:37.399]  This is, imagine the next criminal activity from Biden if he doesn't get in trouble for this.
[01:38:37.639 --> 01:38:39.521]  I mean there's no end to these people.
[01:38:40.987 --> 01:38:43.689]  Yeah, actually, we were discussing that on the road down here.
[01:38:44.089 --> 01:38:45.130]  It's kind of like the same thing.
[01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:47.832]  They're really pressing the ball as much as they can right now.
[01:38:48.193 --> 01:38:52.376]  With the devil-worshipped Lil Nas video, we were having a conversation.
[01:38:52.416 --> 01:38:55.778]  It's almost like the Satanists and the globalists are like, yeah, come get us!
[01:38:56.099 --> 01:38:57.219]  Like, look at what we're doing to you!
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.360]  We're invading your country!
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.761]  We're spreading Satanism to your kids!
[01:38:59.781 --> 01:39:00.162]  Come on!
[01:39:00.362 --> 01:39:00.802]  Come get us!
[01:39:01.022 --> 01:39:02.884]  It's like they're encouraging us to have a response.
[01:39:03.124 --> 01:39:04.365]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:39:04.765 --> 01:39:10.147]  Why are we sending foreign aid to Central America and then taking 20% of their population?
[01:39:10.427 --> 01:39:22.090]  Why are we sending foreign aid to help these countries that oppress their people and then building them million-dollar facilities here in Texas so they can come be a part of a voter bloc for the Democrat Party, sending us more into debt?
[01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:23.450]  Oh, you're on fire!
[01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:24.130]  You're on fire!
[01:39:24.211 --> 01:39:30.312]  Great job going to the facility that they're building, that also is now housing folks, it wasn't just a few weeks ago, to show this giant overflow.
[01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:31.572]  You're about to go to the main facility.
[01:39:31.792 --> 01:39:33.573]  Those reports are all going up at Band.Video.
[01:39:33.793 --> 01:39:40.735]  We'll have those reports on The War Room today, coming up in about an hour and 45 minutes, and you'll be hosting live from the border, from the Rio Grande.
[01:39:40.755 --> 01:39:45.156]  Tom Papert will be co-hosting from the studios that we have up in Kansas.
[01:39:45.556 --> 01:39:47.016]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:47.056 --> 01:39:48.737]  Great job, Owen Schroer and crew.
[01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:50.210]  That's right.
[01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:51.471]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:39:52.231 --> 01:39:57.414]  And Harry Dent's going to be with us for the rest of the hour, a little bit longer if he has time ahead of Gerald Cilente.
[01:39:57.875 --> 01:40:03.718]  But we've got our reporter, Owen Schroyer, on the border at a new giant facility they're building, Donna Migrant Facility 2.
[01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:05.819]  It's already housing up to 4,000.
[01:40:05.859 --> 01:40:07.060]  A bunch of new buildings being built.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.301]  We're about to go to Mr. Dent in about 60 seconds.
[01:40:09.321 --> 01:40:11.402]  But Owen, you're about to walk across the street.
[01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:14.504]  We're told they're trying to stop people that even try to get on the edge of the property.
[01:40:15.645 --> 01:40:16.605]  Yeah, we're going to show you.
[01:40:16.645 --> 01:40:18.486]  I want to give the live audience a closer look.
[01:40:18.526 --> 01:40:19.507]  Here, let's cross the road.
[01:40:20.444 --> 01:40:22.425]  We'll make sure the cameraman doesn't get run over.
[01:40:22.945 --> 01:40:26.547]  But I wanted the live audience to get a look inside here.
[01:40:26.807 --> 01:40:27.307]  Here, look at these.
[01:40:27.387 --> 01:40:28.628]  I mean, the trucks are coming out.
[01:40:29.228 --> 01:40:30.909]  I mean, this is non-stop all day.
[01:40:30.929 --> 01:40:38.092]  And so I wanted the audience to just get a look inside this facility real quick to see how massive it is.
[01:40:38.972 --> 01:40:40.913]  I mean, this thing is so big, Alex.
[01:40:40.933 --> 01:40:44.635]  They could easily... I mean, $4,000 is like nothing for this facility.
[01:40:45.165 --> 01:40:46.566]  So we're just going to give a closer look.
[01:40:46.626 --> 01:40:49.027]  Again, security's not going to let us go in.
[01:40:49.047 --> 01:40:49.967]  We already had to deal with that.
[01:40:49.987 --> 01:40:51.348]  The footage is a banned out video.
[01:40:52.228 --> 01:40:54.590]  But as you can see, I mean, you can't even see the end of this.
[01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:57.511]  This thing goes on forever, Alex.
[01:40:58.263 --> 01:41:07.386]  You can kind of see some of the other tents in the distance, but you can see on the right they're building new facilities, they're laying the groundwork, and on the left they already have rows.
[01:41:07.446 --> 01:41:14.688]  And they're calling for Democrat volunteers, Democrat volunteers with no background check, that I guess have their way with the children however they wish.
[01:41:15.129 --> 01:41:16.529]  Oh, somebody's coming over to you.
[01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:18.210]  Oh yeah?
[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:19.490]  What's up?
[01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:21.011]  Well this is public property right here.
[01:41:22.971 --> 01:41:23.551]  This isn't Rio Grande.
[01:41:23.671 --> 01:41:25.112]  Tell him you can't hear him with his mask.
[01:41:26.803 --> 01:41:28.424]  But this is a public road right here, right?
[01:41:28.504 --> 01:41:31.746]  I'm sorry, I can't hear with the mask on.
[01:41:31.766 --> 01:41:34.248]  What is it?
[01:41:35.128 --> 01:41:36.129]  We're not even on the roadway.
[01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.829]  What if we're right here?
[01:41:36.849 --> 01:41:38.190]  Alright, what if we're right here?
[01:41:38.871 --> 01:41:39.551]  Are we good right here?
[01:41:41.032 --> 01:41:42.873]  We're standing on public property here, sir.
[01:41:42.893 --> 01:41:46.395]  This is not a public property, this road right here.
[01:41:47.016 --> 01:41:48.997]  We haven't even, we're not even crossing the fence line.
[01:41:49.017 --> 01:41:49.998]  Why are you coming out here?
[01:41:51.158 --> 01:41:52.599]  Why are you coming out here to talk to us?
[01:41:52.619 --> 01:41:53.320]  What are you doing?
[01:41:55.208 --> 01:41:56.749]  This is literally public property.
[01:41:56.769 --> 01:41:57.910]  We're not even on the road.
[01:41:58.570 --> 01:42:00.931]  And so now we're not even allowed to film.
[01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:04.033]  Apparently free speech is dead outside of these facilities, Alex.
[01:42:04.673 --> 01:42:06.554]  And so they're going to call security on media now.
[01:42:07.275 --> 01:42:09.336]  So there's no background check on these people.
[01:42:10.196 --> 01:42:16.960]  They're putting... Can you tell me the law that says we can't stand in this property right here?
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.041]  But I'm not inside the facility.
[01:42:19.061 --> 01:42:20.562]  We're standing on a road right here.
[01:42:22.683 --> 01:42:27.772]  Ask him if you were a coyote smuggling a child, though, you could bring the child into them, right?
[01:42:28.033 --> 01:42:32.201]  Okay, but if I was a migrant here smuggling a child in, I'd be good.
[01:42:34.094 --> 01:42:36.496]  There's no smuggling happening with the migrants at the border at all.
[01:42:36.516 --> 01:42:37.157]  It doesn't happen.
[01:42:37.357 --> 01:42:38.498]  Hey Alex, good news.
[01:42:38.798 --> 01:42:39.879]  There's no smuggling at all.
[01:42:39.899 --> 01:42:40.980]  There's no child trafficking.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.961]  There's no human smuggling.
[01:42:42.221 --> 01:42:43.302]  Coyotes don't exist.
[01:42:43.642 --> 01:42:45.764]  Thousands of pounds of fentanyl haven't been found.
[01:42:46.365 --> 01:42:47.906]  Children haven't been put in cages.
[01:42:48.246 --> 01:42:49.888]  Children haven't been put into child trafficking.
[01:42:49.908 --> 01:42:51.949]  It's not happening here Alex, so there's nothing to see.
[01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:53.711]  So he says it's not happening.
[01:42:54.489 --> 01:42:55.109]  That's incredible.
[01:42:55.129 --> 01:43:15.794]  So we're not allowed to film here, we're not allowed to report on what's going on, and hey, but they're allowed to come in here illegally, no background checks, put kids in hotel rooms, spend millions of dollars on facilities like this, and we the American scum, I'm a scumbag American apparently, I'm not even allowed to report on it, and they come and tell me I can't even stand on public ground.
[01:43:16.334 --> 01:43:20.455]  Yeah, ask this guy if he's a DNC, ask this guy if he had a background check to work there.
[01:43:21.596 --> 01:43:23.096]  So, who do you work for, sir?
[01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:25.662]  Deployed services?
[01:43:25.702 --> 01:43:26.762]  Is that a government company?
[01:43:26.782 --> 01:43:27.663]  Is that government?
[01:43:27.683 --> 01:43:29.924]  I don't have any of that information.
[01:43:29.944 --> 01:43:31.145]  You don't know who you work for?
[01:43:33.147 --> 01:43:34.347]  Deployed services.
[01:43:34.447 --> 01:43:38.310]  So who's paying for all of this?
[01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:39.571]  The taxpayers, right?
[01:43:40.351 --> 01:43:42.553]  So the taxpayers aren't allowed to know what's going on.
[01:43:42.593 --> 01:43:50.478]  Hey man, I don't have a problem with you, but you gotta understand... But that's why I'm not in the facility.
[01:43:50.498 --> 01:43:52.619]  If I was in there, I'd understand, but I'm not even there.
[01:43:57.026 --> 01:43:58.507]  Madonna Police Department.
[01:43:58.527 --> 01:44:05.269]  So these orange cones indicate where... So that's where free speech ends.
[01:44:05.309 --> 01:44:05.910]  Alright, Alex.
[01:44:06.090 --> 01:44:07.070]  No, that's not true.
[01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:10.992]  Look, look, it's those power poles is the demarcation line.
[01:44:12.706 --> 01:44:16.069]  Of the government right-of-way on the Common Street.
[01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:18.372]  It's those power poles right there.
[01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:22.196]  So just because they threw some cones over there doesn't mean that's the case.
[01:44:22.276 --> 01:44:25.099]  And they're not even... I mean, you can look here too.
[01:44:25.119 --> 01:44:26.901]  I mean, there's no real line here of cones.
[01:44:27.521 --> 01:44:29.823]  Well, listen, I know you're recording this.
[01:44:29.843 --> 01:44:31.065]  Get it all up on Bandop Video.
[01:44:31.085 --> 01:44:33.887]  We're going to put your shot in the corner of the screen.
[01:44:33.947 --> 01:44:35.289]  As things develop, we'll go back to you.
[01:44:35.309 --> 01:44:37.030]  I'm going to go to our guest, Harry Dent.
[01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:39.092]  Great job, Owen Schroyer and crew.
[01:44:39.393 --> 01:44:43.677]  Harry Dent will be with us 15 minutes to the next hour to catch up and get all the time we need with him.
[01:44:43.737 --> 01:44:45.258]  He's a very popular guest.
[01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:46.440]  Been with us many times.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.440]  Best-selling author.
[01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:48.461]  Used to work for Bain Capital.
[01:44:49.605 --> 01:44:54.068]  I'm not going to go over his Harvard Business School background, all the great things he's done, but harrydent.com.
[01:44:54.108 --> 01:44:58.050]  And he's here because he's predicting that we're coming towards a big crash right now.
[01:44:58.591 --> 01:45:00.672]  And how far can these bubbles go?
[01:45:00.732 --> 01:45:02.233]  What is the Great Reset going to do?
[01:45:02.653 --> 01:45:06.115]  What is it doing with all these different factors that are out there?
[01:45:06.155 --> 01:45:07.776]  What is the global lockdown going to do?
[01:45:08.197 --> 01:45:09.737]  And so thank you so much, Harry.
[01:45:09.758 --> 01:45:14.300]  And I'm sorry we got you on a little bit late, but better late than never.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.001]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:45:15.899 --> 01:45:17.060]  Yeah, good to be back, Alex.
[01:45:18.001 --> 01:45:19.042]  We got about three minutes to break.
[01:45:19.102 --> 01:45:22.865]  Long segment coming up, but your big premise is we're about to see a crash.
[01:45:22.885 --> 01:45:23.385]  Tell us why.
[01:45:24.546 --> 01:45:29.490]  Yeah, you know, we had the COVID shock, and man, did they respond to that.
[01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:38.498]  I mean, even I, knowing how desperate they are, just before COVID with the repo crisis, they started printing money like crazy because things were falling apart.
[01:45:39.098 --> 01:45:44.803]  And then after COVID, $5.1 trillion in fiscal stimulus now with the latest plan.
[01:45:45.243 --> 01:45:51.432]  You add both of those up, 4 trillion monetary, 5.1 fiscal, 9.1 trillion dollars.
[01:45:51.532 --> 01:45:54.356]  Alex, that's 44% of our GDP.
[01:45:54.797 --> 01:45:59.985]  That is a crazy amount of stimulus just to keep an economy barely growing.
[01:46:00.425 --> 01:46:04.287]  One and a half to two percent as we've seen since the 2008-09 crisis.
[01:46:04.307 --> 01:46:09.730]  So really, the long story short, we had a big crisis as the baby boom stopped spending.
[01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:12.111]  Something I predicted a decade before would happen.
[01:46:12.611 --> 01:46:15.252]  Giant debt ratios around the world.
[01:46:15.493 --> 01:46:17.093]  We never dealt with any of that.
[01:46:17.133 --> 01:46:21.676]  We just paved it over with free money and now we're adding fiscal stimulus.
[01:46:21.716 --> 01:46:26.378]  And the problem with fiscal stimulus, Alex, is that more directly causes inflation.
[01:46:27.039 --> 01:46:47.141]  We're coming to an end with rising rates on the bonds conflicting with this stock market that just wants to keep edging up, and I think we could be very close to a peak here, and I think there's a good chance it could happen right here mid to late April.
[01:46:47.441 --> 01:46:53.708]  Well, I'm not a financial guru like you with a great track record of predictions on finances, but I'm pretty good at predicting just general things.
[01:46:53.768 --> 01:46:54.769]  And I agree with you.
[01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:55.970]  How big can bubbles get?
[01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:59.273]  They've tried to force the world to take all this credit by making us stay home.
[01:46:59.594 --> 01:47:00.395]  That didn't work.
[01:47:00.555 --> 01:47:02.317]  And so where can they go from there?
[01:47:02.357 --> 01:47:03.298]  What else do they have left?
[01:47:04.397 --> 01:47:07.039]  Well, again, they just see what I like about that.
[01:47:07.059 --> 01:47:12.662]  When the COVID crisis hit, I said, this is the perfect trigger because this was going to be a big shock.
[01:47:12.702 --> 01:47:18.206]  I mean, everybody knew this was going to be a 20 percent unemployment risk depression right off the bat.
[01:47:18.626 --> 01:47:23.910]  And so they had to either kind of like get real or double down more than ever.
[01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:28.653]  And with nine trillion dollars in a year, that's called doubling down more than ever.
[01:47:28.733 --> 01:47:30.494]  So it forced their hands.
[01:47:30.894 --> 01:47:34.896]  And I think this is so ridiculous now that the markets are going to start to get wary.
[01:47:35.476 --> 01:47:44.219]  I think I've got another pattern that shows we've got another stock crash ever since the first bubble peak in late 2017, early 2018.
[01:47:44.879 --> 01:47:49.761]  Every stock market crash has taken us lower, no matter how much they stimulate.
[01:47:50.181 --> 01:47:54.043]  And I think the next crash is coming soon, and it's going to tell
[01:47:54.523 --> 01:47:59.526]  Consumers and investors, this thing is over, and then there's no amount of money they can print.
[01:47:59.546 --> 01:48:02.427]  So I think this is endgame for the government here.
[01:48:02.447 --> 01:48:05.889]  They, they, I mean, this is crazy to now for 12 years.
[01:48:06.069 --> 01:48:09.812]  Like you say, I've studied bubbles up and down all throughout history.
[01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:13.954]  The longest stock bubbles in history were five years, like 25 to 29.
[01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:18.516]  And in the last tech bubble in the US, six years was the longest.
[01:48:18.536 --> 01:48:19.977]  This is the mother of all bubbles.
[01:48:20.017 --> 01:48:21.018]  Harry Dent, stay there.
[01:48:22.506 --> 01:48:28.030]  Well, I liked President Trump for a lot of reasons, and I understood that he was trying to get sovereignty back to the country that he was faced with.
[01:48:30.611 --> 01:48:34.874]  Not printing a bunch of money and issuing record credit, and we would go into a depression, which was far overdue.
[01:48:34.894 --> 01:48:35.535]  He inherited that.
[01:48:36.035 --> 01:48:41.779]  Or doubling down and trying to get some factories back and push this into the future so Democrats will get blamed.
[01:48:43.223 --> 01:48:45.407]  Now they've removed him, and now Biden.
[01:48:45.427 --> 01:48:46.650]  The confidence is falling apart.
[01:48:46.670 --> 01:48:50.818]  $9 trillion has been put in, and Harry Dent is laying all this out.
[01:48:50.979 --> 01:48:52.842]  Author, researcher, financial expert.
[01:48:54.002 --> 01:48:56.844]  He really studies previous crashes, previous bubbles.
[01:48:56.884 --> 01:48:59.166]  If you just joined us, he was talking about the biggest bubbles.
[01:48:59.787 --> 01:49:01.448]  Oh, usually it'll last six years or so.
[01:49:01.888 --> 01:49:03.930]  This one's lasted over 12 years.
[01:49:04.651 --> 01:49:07.233]  And he's saying we're coming to the end of the line.
[01:49:08.014 --> 01:49:10.035]  Lay out the technicals of that for us.
[01:49:10.115 --> 01:49:12.637]  And is there anything that could keep it going?
[01:49:12.657 --> 01:49:14.159]  Because you thought it wouldn't keep going before.
[01:49:14.239 --> 01:49:15.179]  I didn't think it would keep going.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:21.565]  And now at this point, it's like one of those cartoons where the tire just gets bigger and bigger and finally, boom, explodes.
[01:49:22.554 --> 01:49:24.756]  Well, you know, I've had to do the same thing over and over again.
[01:49:24.796 --> 01:49:45.775]  You think, this can't go much farther, but I also have all these chart patterns that I study, part of my research, and those chart patterns will tell me whether this thing is falling apart or not, and it keeps finding ways to go up, although Bitcoin just broke some marinas that might be troublesome here, and stocks have almost always followed the Bitcoin bubbles.
[01:49:46.235 --> 01:49:49.776]  So, so part of it is just, okay, the bubble's just going to go till it blows.
[01:49:49.836 --> 01:50:01.380]  And again, what I see is the most important thing in the last year since COVID is they had, instead of like stimulating like a trillion a year, they had to jump up to nine trillion.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:09.723]  That's what I've been warning people that the longer this goes, it takes more exponentially to keep the bubble going until it just gets ridiculous.
[01:50:09.743 --> 01:50:11.464]  So just again, think about the numbers.
[01:50:11.524 --> 01:50:12.064]  I threw it earlier.
[01:50:12.084 --> 01:50:12.784]  44% of GDV,
[01:50:14.565 --> 01:50:18.129]  P to get us out of the COVID crisis and barely growing again.
[01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:19.530]  And we'll even see if this lasts.
[01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:21.332]  What are they going to do next time out?
[01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:26.097]  Are they going to print 60% of GDP?
[01:50:26.117 --> 01:50:26.097]  100%?
[01:50:26.137 --> 01:50:27.298]  That's where this is going.
[01:50:27.318 --> 01:50:31.562]  So I think this is where this falls apart.
[01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:34.965]  And part of the other thing that happens, you got to realize that what
[01:50:35.846 --> 01:50:39.727]  I've had this fundamental indicator forever, you know, called the spending wave.
[01:50:39.807 --> 01:50:47.449]  When new generations spend more money, 1983 to 2007, that was the baby boom spending wave, the biggest in history.
[01:50:47.789 --> 01:50:54.550]  I was the only guy bullish enough to see this back in the 80s when everybody thought we would never boom strongly again.
[01:50:54.850 --> 01:50:57.371]  But that was over, ever since.
[01:50:57.799 --> 01:51:06.502]  Baby boomers slowed down in 2008, exactly when we went into the last recession, exactly when I predicted we would, 20-some years before that.
[01:51:07.022 --> 01:51:15.225]  The economy got weak, and the only thing they found to work is they keep putting money into the stock market, which means this quantitative easing.
[01:51:15.265 --> 01:51:21.347]  They just buy stocks and bonds with money printed out of thin air, so it's a total something-for-nothing thing.
[01:51:21.927 --> 01:51:28.375]  The stock market goes up and then at least the top 20% of people that own 88% of the stock feel richer.
[01:51:28.636 --> 01:51:33.422]  They spend a little more money and interest rates go down and that helps earnings of companies.
[01:51:33.702 --> 01:51:36.606]  So you get a financial asset bubble.
[01:51:37.173 --> 01:51:39.815]  So you see, you don't get a strong economic growth.
[01:51:39.855 --> 01:51:44.658]  We've still been growing at 1.6%, the slowest rate ever in this recovery.
[01:51:44.678 --> 01:51:47.220]  We just see the fiat things growing.
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:52.263]  We see Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos looking like they're richer.
[01:51:52.323 --> 01:51:55.365]  They made $5 billion in a week, but really it's all just made up.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:10.385]  Well yeah, the stock market, my fundamental indicator says the Dow, with the slowdown and baby boom natural spending, and we're near the bottom of that cycle between 2020 and 2023, before the next generation turns up.
[01:52:10.445 --> 01:52:14.706]  So that's why the economy's so slow, and it's taking so much stimulus.
[01:52:15.146 --> 01:52:16.688]  So that's the problem here.
[01:52:16.768 --> 01:52:23.817]  Stocks should be at about 12,000 on the Dow with their natural cycles, and they're at 33,000.
[01:52:25.378 --> 01:52:28.843]  And when we finally do have a crash, we'll go below that level.
[01:52:29.183 --> 01:52:34.129]  My target has been, Alex, for the Dow, in the next few years, we're going to see around
[01:52:34.389 --> 01:52:35.270]  We're good to go.
[01:52:52.463 --> 01:52:54.885]  Half at best of what they are, you know, globally.
[01:52:55.246 --> 01:53:02.232]  You can have so much money disappear from the global economy, especially from the more fluent people that own all these financial assets.
[01:53:02.572 --> 01:53:05.155]  There's no way to have a recession out of that.
[01:53:05.235 --> 01:53:06.216]  That's a depression.
[01:53:06.616 --> 01:53:07.957]  And that's what happened in the 30s.
[01:53:07.997 --> 01:53:12.101]  We had the greatest financial bubbles in history peak in 1929.
[01:53:12.522 --> 01:53:14.563]  And it was the collapse of that wealth.
[01:53:14.623 --> 01:53:16.205]  It wasn't just the economy.
[01:53:16.585 --> 01:53:18.327]  It was the collapse of that wealth.
[01:53:18.767 --> 01:53:19.148]  Yes, we are.
[01:53:30.948 --> 01:53:33.210]  of a major financial bubble.
[01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:37.753]  These bubbles are always driven by too much debt, and we've had that forever.
[01:53:38.053 --> 01:53:47.880]  But this one, to cure the debt crash we had in 2008-9, they even went farther into just the straight old, just blow up financial assets.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:49.601]  We can't get consumers to spend.
[01:53:49.902 --> 01:53:53.844]  We can't get the economy to grow because nobody wants to spend because we're in bad demographics.
[01:53:54.165 --> 01:53:55.926]  So we'll blow up financial assets.
[01:53:56.610 --> 01:53:59.293]  And that's the only thing we've gotten and we paid a huge price.
[01:53:59.613 --> 01:54:03.997]  Again, $525 trillion in financial assets in the world.
[01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:07.600]  We had $300 trillion before we hit the 2008 crash.
[01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:11.284]  So imagine how hard this one's going to be.
[01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:12.305]  All it takes
[01:54:12.785 --> 01:54:20.108]  Is for the stock market to go down enough, or something bad to happen in the economy that they can't print their way out of fast enough, and this thing goes.
[01:54:20.208 --> 01:54:27.831]  Because I'm telling you, the next stock crash we see, I am predicting, will be 40% to 50%, probably closer to 50%.
[01:54:27.971 --> 01:54:36.095]  I think if that happens, Alex, after $9 trillion, the biggest stimulus program ever times 10,
[01:54:37.398 --> 01:54:42.600]  After that, that's when people finally get, there is no free lunch to get out of this.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:46.961]  We got to restructure debt and take our medicine and come out the other side.
[01:54:47.381 --> 01:55:00.446]  I'm just telling investors, if you're on the right side of that, if you're in the safe, high-quality bonds, everybody's going to run to like the 30-year treasury and some of the other good bonds in the world, or you're just sitting in cash, you're going to preserve your money while stocks
[01:55:00.806 --> 01:55:05.370]  And real estate and other bonds that are risky all fall.
[01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:11.034]  $525 trillion in financial assets falls to something like $250 to $300 trillion.
[01:55:11.394 --> 01:55:13.436]  You escape that and you're in the safe stuff.
[01:55:14.177 --> 01:55:17.079]  You're going to be able to buy stocks 80, 90% off.
[01:55:17.419 --> 01:55:19.561]  Real estate 40 to 50% off.
[01:55:20.221 --> 01:55:21.422]  On and on and on.
[01:55:21.462 --> 01:55:22.223]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:22.283 --> 01:55:22.983]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:23.284 --> 01:55:24.805]  I've never gotten into Bitcoin.
[01:55:24.885 --> 01:55:26.826]  And I have guests on that are for it, guests that are against it.
[01:55:27.507 --> 01:55:27.947]  But I see
[01:55:29.344 --> 01:55:30.285]  Soros getting into it.
[01:55:30.325 --> 01:55:31.765]  I see the big banks getting into it.
[01:55:32.145 --> 01:55:34.486]  I see it being the dominant cryptocurrency.
[01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:37.248]  And even if it goes way down, I don't think it's going away.
[01:55:37.268 --> 01:55:38.348]  I think it comes back later.
[01:55:39.469 --> 01:55:45.772]  But I mean, give us your honest view on that, because you're saying Bitcoin tends to be, you know, a sign of what's going to happen in the general markets.
[01:55:46.886 --> 01:55:47.967]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:48.167 --> 01:55:49.987]  Bitcoin is so misunderstood.
[01:55:50.748 --> 01:55:52.469]  People are calling it an inflation hedge.
[01:55:52.529 --> 01:55:58.151]  No, gold is an actual inflation hedge, and the reason gold's not doing that well is we don't have inflation out of all.
[01:55:58.191 --> 01:56:01.993]  This is a deflationary process when you have all this debt that wants to keep you out.
[01:56:02.013 --> 01:56:03.574]  So what about stagflations, what's coming?
[01:56:04.873 --> 01:56:05.394]  No, no.
[01:56:05.594 --> 01:56:07.015]  Deflation is what's coming.
[01:56:07.035 --> 01:56:14.623]  When all these assets come down to reality, that's when the most amount of money... See, they've been pumping up financial assets for decades now.
[01:56:15.264 --> 01:56:18.307]  Then, when this thing's destroyed, all that money disappears.
[01:56:18.367 --> 01:56:22.151]  And then you don't fast-stock... Sir, you're talking about an outright depression.
[01:56:22.211 --> 01:56:24.754]  Are you talking about an outright depression?
[01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:26.025]  Yeah!
[01:56:26.366 --> 01:56:33.053]  Because all this money disappears, and then people feel less wealthy, and banks go under, and companies go under.
[01:56:33.093 --> 01:56:35.696]  So you don't think, you think we're going to see depression without inflation?
[01:56:36.216 --> 01:56:37.778]  Because you're saying it's all been an investment?
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:38.780]  Absolutely.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.141]  I will jump off a cliff if we end up out of this with high inflation.
[01:56:43.201 --> 01:56:44.861]  I have to debate gold bugs.
[01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:49.742]  They're very intelligent because at least they know you can't grow by printing money out of thin air.
[01:56:50.022 --> 01:56:53.083]  But they see an inflationary outcome from overprinting.
[01:56:53.583 --> 01:56:55.223]  I see a deflationary outcome.
[01:56:55.243 --> 01:56:56.823]  And this is what history says, Alex.
[01:56:57.143 --> 01:56:58.004]  Crystal clear.
[01:56:58.024 --> 01:57:01.464]  Well, that's because all the investment's going into fiat instead of infrastructure.
[01:57:02.624 --> 01:57:02.884]  Huh?
[01:57:03.685 --> 01:57:06.185]  Because all the investment's going into fiat instead of infrastructure.
[01:57:07.330 --> 01:57:09.791]  Well, it's going into the financial markets.
[01:57:10.152 --> 01:57:13.993]  All this money they print is not going to consumers and businesses.
[01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:18.516]  Now, the fiscal stimulus recently, which is just starting, that does more.
[01:57:18.556 --> 01:57:19.336]  So that's different.
[01:57:19.456 --> 01:57:22.077]  And that's when you have to start worrying about inflation.
[01:57:22.338 --> 01:57:25.759]  All this money printing, the gold bugs say it's going to cause inflation.
[01:57:25.819 --> 01:57:29.261]  No, it's not going into the economy and consumer prices.
[01:57:29.601 --> 01:57:31.362]  It's just buying more stocks.
[01:57:31.682 --> 01:57:39.087]  More and more money into the stock and bond pool and real estate and all these financial assets are now worth two to three times what they should be.
[01:57:39.127 --> 01:57:40.268]  Stay there, Harry Dent.
[01:57:40.468 --> 01:57:40.868]  Stay there.
[01:57:40.948 --> 01:57:46.171]  I'm going to come back and ask you then how the big power establishments going to handle this, what they're doing.
[01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:47.992]  Like Bill Gates, he's buying farmland.
[01:57:48.233 --> 01:57:49.714]  You're saying, well, you don't need real estate.
[01:57:49.734 --> 01:57:50.354]  Well, we'll be right back.
[01:57:52.215 --> 01:57:54.336]  Well, what's going to happen when the bubble bursts?
[01:57:54.717 --> 01:57:56.318]  We're talking to Harry Dent right now.
[01:57:56.338 --> 01:57:57.358]  We'll go back to him in just a moment.
[01:57:57.458 --> 01:57:57.939]  I know this.
[01:58:00.117 --> 01:58:02.118]  If we don't get support, we're not going to be on air.
[01:58:02.138 --> 01:58:11.303]  Because on top of all this economic crisis, the left and big corporations are now attacking whoever isn't woke, whoever doesn't go along with gun control or open borders.
[01:58:12.123 --> 01:58:15.805]  And it's the global Chinese social credit score that we are seeing.
[01:58:15.825 --> 01:58:17.346]  Just last week, the Federal Reserve had
[01:58:18.086 --> 01:58:18.566]  We're good to go.
[01:58:48.286 --> 01:58:52.390]  We have now lost over a hundred in the last three years.
[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:58.115]  Even if we hide who we are to get a service, they later come and say, you can't have that service.
[01:58:58.155 --> 01:59:00.777]  Just lost another big service yesterday.
[01:59:01.458 --> 01:59:03.299]  They gave us notice because of who we are.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.383]  And so it's a global oppression system.
[01:59:08.384 --> 01:59:10.385]  They give us the debt by
[01:59:11.366 --> 01:59:18.968]  Giving themselves all this credit, then they buy up real companies, they buy up real farmland, they buy up real assets, and then all we get left is the debt.
[01:59:19.288 --> 01:59:21.209]  The real economy has been vertically integrated.
[01:59:21.609 --> 01:59:22.749]  It's been made non-essential.
[01:59:22.849 --> 01:59:27.911]  It's shutting down with the big box stores, even shutting down to Amazon.
[01:59:28.351 --> 01:59:31.952]  And really, I see it as a orchestrated, very authoritarian
[01:59:32.532 --> 01:59:32.812]  Thank you.
[01:59:51.425 --> 01:59:54.367]  Diverse guests on covering real issues that isn't controlled.

[02:00:12.876 --> 02:00:14.017]  That ends Wednesday night.
[02:00:14.037 --> 02:00:14.797]  We have the special.
[02:00:15.018 --> 02:00:17.099]  But that was a question and a plug on my products.
[02:00:17.919 --> 02:00:19.239]  Talk about who's to blame.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:21.460]  Where Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:25.221]  Morgan, where the Chi-Coms are going, what they're planning in all of this.
[02:00:28.402 --> 02:00:30.542]  Terry, what do you see them doing?
[02:00:30.742 --> 02:00:31.903]  What's the master plan?
[02:00:31.923 --> 02:00:33.203]  You know, this is a similar thing.
[02:00:33.463 --> 02:00:35.424]  Everybody benefits in the bubble.
[02:00:35.524 --> 02:00:39.945]  Even everyday people have a 3% mortgage, where at normal rates it would be 5-6%.
[02:00:39.965 --> 02:00:41.585]  2% car loan, I looked up last time.
[02:00:43.786 --> 02:00:44.326]  Two percent!
[02:00:44.346 --> 02:00:47.448]  I used to pay six to seven percent on a dumb car loan.
[02:00:47.889 --> 02:00:53.492]  And of course, the economy's growing when it would be contracting more after all this debt and stuff.
[02:00:53.712 --> 02:00:55.053]  So everybody benefits.
[02:00:55.093 --> 02:01:00.196]  But of course, the financial services companies, this bubble is a total boon.
[02:01:00.256 --> 02:01:06.480]  So and CNBC, you get the financial news stations, they're cheerleaders for this bubble.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:08.921]  Everybody wants this bubble to happen.
[02:01:09.101 --> 02:01:10.382]  Everybody's benefiting.
[02:01:10.862 --> 02:01:13.164]  It's just that the wealthiest and the most
[02:01:13.664 --> 02:01:20.228]  Most financial-oriented companies and countries are benefiting the most.
[02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:23.310]  And so they're always going to push this.
[02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:27.953]  And again, I just tell people, this is so big, you cannot stop this.
[02:01:27.993 --> 02:01:30.294]  People say, well, Harry, you're going to take this down.
[02:01:30.314 --> 02:01:31.254]  You're criticizing it.
[02:01:31.274 --> 02:01:35.617]  No, only 1% of the people, the smarter people, listen to people like me.
[02:01:36.057 --> 02:01:41.460]  There's no way I'm going to influence popular opinion enough for people to revolt against this.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:42.341]  So you just have
[02:01:42.581 --> 02:01:43.762]  Let me ask you this.
[02:01:43.782 --> 02:01:44.222]  Let me ask you this.
[02:02:06.391 --> 02:02:16.678]  Whether you're in Australia or Europe or the UK or the US, the left is hyping radical racial division, political correctness to control and balkanize the public.
[02:02:17.038 --> 02:02:21.641]  What's going to happen if in a boom economy we've got so many racial problems and attacks?
[02:02:22.162 --> 02:02:28.406]  What is going to happen during a real depression and how long do you think this will last and what type of recovery do you think comes out of it?
[02:02:29.326 --> 02:02:30.507]  Well, you know where I am, Alex.
[02:02:30.587 --> 02:02:31.728]  I'm in Puerto Rico.
[02:02:32.958 --> 02:02:37.321]  Partly because I found a great vacation home here a long time ago and started coming down here.
[02:02:37.361 --> 02:02:39.402]  But Puerto Rico's got its problems.
[02:02:39.422 --> 02:02:40.863]  They got demographic problems.
[02:02:40.883 --> 02:02:41.904]  They got debt problems.
[02:02:41.944 --> 02:02:47.647]  But they don't have this kind of war between the right and left, the blue-red wars, I call it.
[02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:49.508]  I don't see civil unrest.
[02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:52.250]  They've been in a recession off and on for 13 years.
[02:02:52.590 --> 02:02:53.691]  They don't have civil unrest.
[02:02:53.851 --> 02:02:55.252]  I don't see how you don't.
[02:02:56.012 --> 02:02:56.132]  Yes.
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:23.751]  I feel good about being in Puerto Rico in this circumstance, and I'm still very close to the U.S., and get to Miami in two hours, and New York in four, and all this sort of stuff.
[02:03:23.771 --> 02:03:26.234]  But it is not just a financial crisis.
[02:03:26.254 --> 02:03:28.116]  Doesn't Adam Schiff live in Puerto Rico, too?
[02:03:28.136 --> 02:03:30.579]  It is a civil crisis coming.
[02:03:30.619 --> 02:03:31.881]  Not Adam Schiff.
[02:03:31.941 --> 02:03:32.461]  Peter Schiff.
[02:03:32.802 --> 02:03:34.364]  A lot of folks are moving to Puerto Rico.
[02:03:36.738 --> 02:03:38.319]  Well, they came up.
[02:03:38.479 --> 02:03:43.082]  Puerto Rico has such bad demographics, Alex, for a simple reason.
[02:03:43.122 --> 02:03:43.763]  They're U.S.
[02:03:43.803 --> 02:03:45.564]  citizens and they can move to the U.S.
[02:03:45.644 --> 02:03:51.588]  freely, and they do, because the job prospects are usually better once they get a pretty darn good education here.
[02:03:51.628 --> 02:03:52.789]  So the U.S.
[02:03:52.849 --> 02:03:56.692]  has always subsidized Puerto Rico to make up for the fact
[02:03:57.032 --> 02:03:57.132]  Yes.
[02:04:16.858 --> 02:04:17.519]  We're good to go.
[02:04:40.414 --> 02:04:42.956]  A good deal for the right type of businesses right now.
[02:04:43.156 --> 02:04:50.940]  And it's really one of the few things keeping Puerto Rico from being in a deeper recession that these Americans are coming in.
[02:04:51.701 --> 02:04:55.823]  They're not paying much income taxes, but they're paying a lot of sales and property taxes.
[02:04:55.863 --> 02:04:58.504]  They're buying property and they're hiring people.
[02:04:58.544 --> 02:05:05.629]  And I'm telling you, I'm a demographic expert and I always say to people how bad the demographics are in places like Japan and they've been.
[02:05:05.969 --> 02:05:07.810]  Puerto Rico makes Japan look good.
[02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.830]  It's that bad.
[02:05:10.552 --> 02:05:13.621]  So these tax incentives, the U.S.
[02:05:13.701 --> 02:05:18.555]  is forced to do things to keep Puerto Rico afloat, otherwise they'd have to totally bail them out.
[02:05:19.642 --> 02:05:33.756]  Wow, we got a few segments left and then after you leave us, Head of General Salente, I'm going to hit this incredible fear-mongering where we have the CDC basically saying that the economy can never reopen because of COVID-19.
[02:05:34.057 --> 02:05:37.961]  But I see the statistics and a lot of fear-mongering that was done with that.
[02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:42.886]  How do you think the ongoing attempts to keep lockdowns going around the world are going to affect the economy?
[02:05:43.786 --> 02:05:46.668]  Well, no, I mean, this thing is like the influenza of 1918.
[02:05:46.808 --> 02:05:49.849]  It is a short-term crisis.
[02:05:49.889 --> 02:05:53.231]  You do have to fight it, otherwise it just grows exponentially.
[02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:55.012]  But it's not a long-term crisis.
[02:05:55.392 --> 02:06:01.476]  We had the 2018 influenza and 19 crises in that, and a crash in the economy in the early 20s.
[02:06:01.496 --> 02:06:03.037]  Then we had the roaring 20s.
[02:06:03.097 --> 02:06:09.080]  So this is not going to stop our economy for years and years to come.
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:14.781]  And I think the smartest countries, and I spent a lot of time in Australia and New Zealand.
[02:06:14.801 --> 02:06:16.742]  I love those countries.
[02:06:16.862 --> 02:06:21.423]  They attacked it straight on, hard, and they've never had a big problem.
[02:06:21.463 --> 02:06:23.644]  The Asian countries reacted faster.
[02:06:23.664 --> 02:06:35.147]  Some people say there's a conspiracy theory that, hey, the Chinese start this thing because they know Americans and Europeans are more individualistic and will not follow the rules, and something like this will hurt them more than it.
[02:06:35.167 --> 02:06:35.867]  And that's what happened.
[02:06:36.347 --> 02:06:37.948]  It's hitting the U.S.
[02:06:38.008 --> 02:06:42.050]  and Europe hard, and in places like Brazil, it's not.
[02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:48.534]  It never hit Asia that hard or that long, and it never hit Australia and New Zealand, because they reacted quicker.
[02:06:48.574 --> 02:06:54.017]  Sure, but we were told stuff like two and a half million Americans dead, and then it was, you know, half a million or whatever.
[02:06:54.037 --> 02:07:01.521]  I mean, they were definitely, Bill Gates and others were exaggerating the death toll from the beginning, really trying to create a lot of undue fear.
[02:07:01.841 --> 02:07:03.182]  Well, I mean, it can be that.
[02:07:03.222 --> 02:07:05.283]  This is exponential, but it's true.
[02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:09.546]  People tend to exaggerate because they want to get people to do the right thing.
[02:07:09.566 --> 02:07:12.448]  All I'm saying is it's already dropped.
[02:07:14.289 --> 02:07:15.510]  80% the cases in the U.S.
[02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:17.511]  and the death rates, okay, already dropped.
[02:07:17.912 --> 02:07:19.753]  We've finally gotten smart enough.
[02:07:19.933 --> 02:07:21.915]  All people have to do is just be kind of telling.
[02:07:21.955 --> 02:07:23.736]  You don't have to lock yourself in your home.
[02:07:24.137 --> 02:07:25.558]  I still go out and stuff.
[02:07:25.878 --> 02:07:29.481]  I still travel when I have to, even though I'm happy I don't, frankly.
[02:07:29.501 --> 02:07:31.202]  This has done wonders for me.
[02:07:31.242 --> 02:07:35.926]  I can do a lot of business in Australia now without having to fly over there and get killed with jet lag twice a year.
[02:07:36.486 --> 02:07:52.940]  So it's been good for me actually do more online stuff and good for a lot of businesses and that's another thing I say you got to understand the economy and nature and God and how everything works challenges part of it you don't get growth without challenge the problem with governments is they don't want
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:55.842]  They don't respect free market capitalism.
[02:07:55.882 --> 02:07:57.122]  They like the success side.
[02:07:57.163 --> 02:07:58.243]  They don't like the failure.
[02:07:58.263 --> 02:08:03.527]  You have to let companies fail as well as succeed in a free market economy.
[02:08:03.547 --> 02:08:03.767]  Let's talk.
[02:08:03.787 --> 02:08:04.187]  Let's go.
[02:08:04.207 --> 02:08:04.927]  Two-minute break.
[02:08:05.268 --> 02:08:06.188]  Harry Dent, stay there.
[02:08:06.388 --> 02:08:07.069]  Two-minute break.
[02:08:07.089 --> 02:08:11.992]  I want to come back and ask you about China and about Australia and what's going to happen over in the Pacific areas.
[02:08:12.392 --> 02:08:13.593]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[02:08:13.653 --> 02:08:15.594]  Then I've got some other big news to hit.
[02:08:15.974 --> 02:08:17.756]  Some breaking news dealing with the border.
[02:08:17.776 --> 02:08:18.176]  Stay with us.
[02:08:19.295 --> 02:08:23.021]  Harry Dent of harrydent.com is our guest for five more minutes.
[02:08:23.081 --> 02:08:25.706]  I really appreciate his time.
[02:08:25.746 --> 02:08:28.370]  I've got some more news I'm going to hit before Charles Lundy takes over next segment.
[02:08:29.272 --> 02:08:33.038]  Tell people how they can get your newsletter and how they can find your books and other materials.
[02:08:33.971 --> 02:08:35.692]  Yeah, this is a free weekly newsletter.
[02:08:35.732 --> 02:08:37.873]  My partner and I get to write articles every week.
[02:08:37.913 --> 02:08:40.775]  We have paid newsletters too, but this is for people to get to know us.
[02:08:41.095 --> 02:08:42.816]  All you do is go to harrydent.com.
[02:08:43.136 --> 02:08:44.497]  You just give us our email address.
[02:08:44.517 --> 02:08:46.418]  You're on our newsletter right away.
[02:08:46.438 --> 02:08:48.819]  And this is a good time to get on it, by the way.
[02:08:48.879 --> 02:08:51.300]  So I would encourage that strongly.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:59.645]  And the last book I came out with, and I'm waiting till this crash sets in to really have a new theme, like how do we get out the other side of this?
[02:09:00.085 --> 02:09:02.166]  Zero Hour is the last book.
[02:09:03.207 --> 02:09:04.909]  I wrote, and that you can get on Amazon.
[02:09:04.929 --> 02:09:08.293]  All right, let's briefly talk about China.
[02:09:09.294 --> 02:09:12.498]  Who's over leveraged, the US or China, and how do you see the two competing?
[02:09:13.283 --> 02:09:15.605]  Okay, that's an excellent question.
[02:09:15.625 --> 02:09:16.505]  The U.S.
[02:09:16.565 --> 02:09:27.412]  has the biggest bubble we've ever had in everything real estate, but we have less of a debt bubble than Europe, and China is the epicenter of this entire bubble.
[02:09:27.472 --> 02:09:31.694]  Who's seen the greatest growth since the early 80s and the baby boom boom?
[02:09:32.015 --> 02:09:35.557]  It's been Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.
[02:09:35.577 --> 02:09:37.138]  It's been East Asia
[02:09:37.618 --> 02:09:38.779]  That's been the explosion.
[02:09:38.819 --> 02:09:40.480]  They have urbanized rapidly.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.683]  They've gone from emerging countries to developed countries increasingly.
[02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:46.285]  And that's been the boom.
[02:09:46.325 --> 02:09:47.345]  And China!
[02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:49.867]  China doesn't print money, Alex, like we do.
[02:09:50.148 --> 02:09:51.689]  They just build stuff for nobody.
[02:09:51.729 --> 02:09:53.230]  They print condos!
[02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:56.291]  And office buildings and build railways.
[02:09:56.511 --> 02:10:03.894]  I mean, that's the worst thing you can do for economy because you get all this excess capacity, which weighs on the economy with excess debt.
[02:10:04.714 --> 02:10:07.015]  And so that's their problem.
[02:10:07.135 --> 02:10:11.336]  They have made bad investments now for 20, 30 years.
[02:10:11.956 --> 02:10:16.358]  And today, 22% of condos and homes in cities are
[02:10:16.738 --> 02:10:17.258]  We're good.
[02:10:33.184 --> 02:10:39.409]  China is going to be the biggest bubble burst of this, and everybody thinks China can do no wrong.
[02:10:39.449 --> 02:10:48.256]  Well, people thought that about Japan, Alex, in the late 80s, and I was the first guy to come out in my first book and say, the 90s is going to see the collapse of Japan.
[02:10:48.297 --> 02:10:49.758]  They will never be the same.
[02:10:50.218 --> 02:10:52.000]  And I'm saying the same thing for China.
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:54.882]  China and East Asia are done.
[02:10:55.262 --> 02:10:59.786]  They're also the biggest bubble, so they will have the highest unemployment.
[02:11:00.186 --> 02:11:02.447]  The biggest drops in things like real estate.
[02:11:02.527 --> 02:11:05.628]  China has the most overvalued real estate market in the world.
[02:11:06.028 --> 02:11:11.691]  And a collapse in real estate, which we will see too, is way worse than stocks because people borrow.
[02:11:11.951 --> 02:11:18.073]  People and businesses and governments borrow to buy real estate so it causes a huge debt crisis.
[02:11:19.454 --> 02:11:20.354]  What happens to Australia?
[02:11:21.898 --> 02:11:26.161]  Australia has the second worst real estate bubble in the world.
[02:11:26.482 --> 02:11:28.143]  They're going to see a bigger crash than us.
[02:11:28.423 --> 02:11:36.729]  They do not have the demographic weakness we do, because they have a constant road of high-end Asian immigrants.
[02:11:36.749 --> 02:11:38.831]  They don't get the low-end people like we get, okay?
[02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:47.237]  They get higher-than-average income people, so their demographics are strong, but their real estate bubble is the second worst only to China.
[02:11:48.097 --> 02:11:56.120]  And they are in their best customers, their exports go into that East Asian corridor that's going to get hit the hardest.
[02:11:56.140 --> 02:12:00.101]  So China bubble blows, Australia will feel it much more.
[02:12:00.461 --> 02:12:03.282]  They trade probably three times as much with China.
[02:12:03.302 --> 02:12:04.963]  Same thing New Zealand?
[02:12:05.443 --> 02:12:06.123]  Same thing New Zealand?
[02:12:07.330 --> 02:12:08.330]  Same thing in New Zealand.
[02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:10.511]  Australia is a little worse, but yes.
[02:12:11.051 --> 02:12:20.172]  So that's the... Otherwise, I would say those countries would have the least of problems, and they still are not going to have... Let's put it this way.
[02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:22.553]  They'll come out of this quicker, okay?
[02:12:22.953 --> 02:12:29.214]  But they are going to get hit hard, and people in Australia, my best audience, and they just can't believe it.
[02:12:29.234 --> 02:12:32.815]  They have had an economy... They didn't even get a recession in the early 90s.
[02:12:33.755 --> 02:12:39.397]  Nevertheless, recently in the last tech crash, so they really don't know what's about to hit them over there.
[02:12:39.457 --> 02:12:39.818]  All right.
[02:12:39.878 --> 02:12:41.358]  Harry Dent, always great to have you on.
[02:12:41.378 --> 02:12:42.659]  Thank you so much, harrydent.com.
[02:12:44.159 --> 02:12:44.399]  Wow.
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:54.944]  OK, well, given you all the perspectives here, I think a lot of that sound information, so we're not just going to be cheerleaders here, but this is an insane bubble and they seem to be suspending the laws of the economy.
[02:12:54.984 --> 02:12:57.225]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with a bunch of news.
[02:12:57.245 --> 02:12:57.645]  Stay with us.
[02:12:58.205 --> 02:13:02.447]  So Joe Biden, the skeleton, the mummy in chief,
[02:13:03.928 --> 02:13:14.256]  Oh Biden, as I call him, just had another small controlled press conference where he pled with the governors to keep the mask on, keep things locked down forever.
[02:13:14.916 --> 02:13:16.157]  We've got to suppress the economy.
[02:13:16.177 --> 02:13:19.179]  We've got to get the universal income in.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:23.402]  We've got to keep things shut down so China stays up.
[02:13:24.103 --> 02:13:25.103]  There it is, President Joe Biden.
[02:13:27.008 --> 02:13:31.489]  Reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate.
[02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:32.189]  Please!
[02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:33.269]  This is not politics!
[02:13:33.749 --> 02:13:34.750]  Reinstate the mandate!
[02:13:35.770 --> 02:13:36.970]  If you let it down.
[02:13:36.990 --> 02:13:39.091]  Oh my gosh.
[02:13:39.471 --> 02:13:40.971]  And they're saying, oh, frightening numbers.
[02:13:41.251 --> 02:13:43.452]  Texas got rid of all the garbage, the COVID numbers have plummeted.
[02:13:44.392 --> 02:13:48.193]  So truth is, people get sick of bacterial pneumonia wearing these masks, staying indoors.
[02:13:48.713 --> 02:13:49.293]  It's incredible.
[02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:56.393]  We'll be covering more of that in the War Room today, ladies and gentlemen, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:13:57.373 --> 02:14:02.676]  Pathetic CDC director says she's very scared, warns of impending doom.
[02:14:02.696 --> 02:14:05.858]  A big spike in COVID cases.
[02:14:07.619 --> 02:14:11.762]  Always in the cities they control where they can do the fake PCR test and turn them up.
[02:14:12.382 --> 02:14:17.886]  Let's listen to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, fear-mongering, part of our medical tyranny.
[02:14:17.926 --> 02:14:18.226]  Here it is.
[02:14:19.895 --> 02:14:26.701]  I'm going to pause here, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.
[02:14:27.481 --> 02:14:36.369]  We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope, but right now I'm scared.
[02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:39.612]  I know what it's like- Hold on, stop this, stop this.
[02:14:39.632 --> 02:14:40.272]  We're going to start over.
[02:14:40.833 --> 02:14:41.513]  Go back to the beginning.
[02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:43.455]  I mean, is she auditioning?
[02:14:45.868 --> 02:14:51.190]  To be AOC, the world's going to end in 11 years if we don't give all our money to the Rothschilds with carbon taxes.
[02:14:52.304 --> 02:14:55.006]  Let's just get rid of the script here, okay?
[02:14:55.126 --> 02:14:56.427]  I'm really scared right now.
[02:14:56.487 --> 02:15:08.096]  If you don't take, if you don't wear your mask, if you don't stay in your house and be non-essential and die, if we don't ship people with diseases and nursing homes to kill old people, we won't have any dead numbers, and then you'll stop being under our control.
[02:15:08.116 --> 02:15:09.397]  We just stole this election.
[02:15:09.557 --> 02:15:11.499]  We're Chinese communist agents, okay?
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.762]  Oh, please, thank you.
[02:15:14.782 --> 02:15:16.063]  We're non-essential.
[02:15:16.103 --> 02:15:19.785]  We need Amazon and Google and Facebook to make more.
[02:15:20.586 --> 02:15:23.607]  We need you to stay and have your children wear masks!
[02:15:24.027 --> 02:15:25.628]  Never let them take them off!
[02:15:26.588 --> 02:15:28.569]  It's only 15 days to cut the curve!
[02:15:30.970 --> 02:15:31.771]  It's 10 years!
[02:15:32.431 --> 02:15:34.112]  Thank God you're not in England or Germany, folks.
[02:15:34.172 --> 02:15:35.352]  It's never stopping there.
[02:15:36.132 --> 02:15:37.953]  Oh, you want to protest Macron?
[02:15:37.973 --> 02:15:40.314]  You want to protest with the yellow vest?
[02:15:40.474 --> 02:15:43.635]  We'll just put you under permanent martial law while we invade you with the Muslims.
[02:15:44.916 --> 02:15:46.617]  This is the one with our borders wide open.
[02:15:47.177 --> 02:15:49.478]  Oh, don't test them down there, because they know it's all crap!
[02:15:51.277 --> 02:15:52.418]  Is there real pneumonia down there?
[02:15:52.458 --> 02:15:53.318]  Real, absolutely.
[02:15:53.518 --> 02:15:53.918]  Real TB?
[02:15:53.938 --> 02:15:54.099]  Yeah!
[02:15:54.259 --> 02:15:56.580]  If you die of TB, she'll say, oh please!
[02:15:56.880 --> 02:15:58.741]  We've got millions coming in with TB!
[02:15:58.981 --> 02:16:00.062]  It's gonna, that's a real thing!
[02:16:00.222 --> 02:16:01.303]  But no, she's not worried about something real.
[02:16:01.323 --> 02:16:02.703]  She's like, please be scared!
[02:16:02.763 --> 02:16:03.504]  I'm telling you!
[02:16:03.804 --> 02:16:04.524]  Be scared!
[02:16:04.584 --> 02:16:04.945]  Don't!
[02:16:05.325 --> 02:16:06.485]  Don't ever do it!
[02:16:06.666 --> 02:16:07.226]  Here, watch it.
[02:16:10.236 --> 02:16:17.043]  I'm going to pause here, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.
[02:16:17.844 --> 02:16:24.912]  We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope.
[02:16:24.932 --> 02:16:25.453]  Start over again.
[02:16:27.369 --> 02:16:27.509]  Please.
[02:16:27.529 --> 02:16:29.370]  See, this is how it always works.
[02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:32.151]  Everyone didn't take the shot two years from now.
[02:16:32.452 --> 02:16:34.513]  Sorry you can't ever leave your house and gotta wear a mask.
[02:16:34.793 --> 02:16:36.374]  There's some people that won't do it.
[02:16:36.594 --> 02:16:43.917]  You know, we, if you would have just been like China and been good, or New Zealand total martial law and been good, there wouldn't be any cases.
[02:16:44.198 --> 02:16:45.258]  Because they can just make it up.
[02:16:45.298 --> 02:16:45.798]  They lie.
[02:16:45.818 --> 02:16:46.879]  It's a PCR test.
[02:16:48.439 --> 02:16:50.080]  This woman knows full well what she's doing.
[02:16:50.661 --> 02:16:52.362]  Perched up there with psychological whatever.
[02:16:52.622 --> 02:16:53.723]  Please be Chicken Little!
[02:16:53.963 --> 02:16:55.084]  Please Cloward and Piven!
[02:16:55.325 --> 02:16:56.646]  Please go in your house and starve!
[02:16:56.906 --> 02:16:58.367]  Please give us control of your children!
[02:16:58.667 --> 02:17:00.008]  Please let Big Tech run you!
[02:17:00.249 --> 02:17:00.549]  Please!
[02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.869]  Please!
[02:17:00.949 --> 02:17:02.030]  Please!
[02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:03.011]  Please!
[02:17:03.031 --> 02:17:09.416]  Instead of you need to go to prison and so does Fauci and Bill Gates and all of you lying scum!
[02:17:10.937 --> 02:17:14.820]  These are eugenicists, Great Reset, New World Order, depopulationists.
[02:17:15.481 --> 02:17:16.702]  Now listen to this witch again.
[02:17:18.991 --> 02:17:25.712]  I'm going to pause here, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.
[02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:32.852]  We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential.
[02:17:33.332 --> 02:17:36.953]  As long as you do exactly what she says, there may be a way out of this.
[02:17:36.993 --> 02:17:44.755]  Get your QR code, get your global licensing system, let us face scan you to leave your house, and then maybe we'll be safe.
[02:17:44.775 --> 02:17:51.477]  But you've got to let us implement it all first, and we barely are getting it implemented in England and New York and other areas, so it's not ready.
[02:17:51.697 --> 02:17:55.418]  We're gonna have trouble making you all do this if we can't get it clamped down on those areas.
[02:17:55.678 --> 02:18:07.318]  And if they see you being free and not being sick like Texas and Florida, then they're not going to accept our lie and we're not going to win!
[02:18:07.358 --> 02:18:08.260]  That's a translation.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:09.202]  Sorry, start from the beginning.
[02:18:10.868 --> 02:18:17.672]  I'm going to pause here, I'm going to lose the script, and I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.
[02:18:18.452 --> 02:18:27.297]  We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope, but right now I'm scared.
[02:18:28.844 --> 02:18:41.787]  I know what it's like as a physician to stand in that patient room, gowned, gloved, masked, shielded, and to be the last person to touch someone else's loved one because their loved one couldn't be there.
[02:18:42.927 --> 02:18:49.828]  I know what it's like when you're the physician, when you're the healthcare provider, and you're worried that you don't have the resources to take care of the patient.
[02:18:49.868 --> 02:18:56.630]  Do you know what it's like when they had six months of lockdown still ongoing in African places and 10 plus million starved to death?
[02:18:57.537 --> 02:19:00.263]  Well, it was like they starved to death because their trade with us is how they live.
[02:19:00.664 --> 02:19:01.686]  Oh, your people love that.
[02:19:01.706 --> 02:19:02.648]  You're depopulating, right?
[02:19:02.669 --> 02:19:03.410]  You ugly witch.
[02:19:03.711 --> 02:19:04.232]  Let's continue.
[02:19:06.693 --> 02:19:14.439]  I know that feeling of nausea when you read the crisis standards of care and you wonder whether there are going to be enough ventilators to go around.
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:19.583]  Oh, there's not enough ventilators in your new guillotines to kill as many people as possible.
[02:19:19.803 --> 02:19:24.166]  They admit in New York almost all the deaths with a misapplication of ventilators on people that didn't need them so you killed them.
[02:19:24.546 --> 02:19:26.768]  You know the sickening feeling of the ventilator?
[02:19:26.788 --> 02:19:28.469]  Of the K-Still-Cool granny?
[02:19:31.673 --> 02:19:37.274]  And I know what it's like to pull up to your hospital every day and see the extra morgue sitting outside.
[02:19:39.235 --> 02:19:43.416]  Yeah, you mean all those empty hospitals, lying about it while you dance to TikTok?
[02:19:45.196 --> 02:19:47.577]  Wow, these people are so full of crap.
[02:19:47.617 --> 02:19:48.297]  Here's the next one.
[02:19:49.877 --> 02:19:55.659]  Canada suspends AstraZeneca vaccine for people under 55 following reports of blood clots and death.
[02:19:56.670 --> 02:20:01.917]  Holocaust survivor slams endless lockdowns as worse and more insidious than Nazi Germany.
[02:20:02.738 --> 02:20:04.440]  Oh, and don't worry though, I'm the bad guy.
[02:20:04.461 --> 02:20:06.083]  I'm not running death camps in China like Apple.
[02:20:06.523 --> 02:20:14.053]  Amazon is still supporting and collecting commissions from Alex Jones storefront, even after Facebook, YouTube, Spotify banned fart.
[02:20:14.614 --> 02:20:14.854]  Fart.
[02:20:15.094 --> 02:20:16.836]  Far right-wing radio host.
[02:20:17.236 --> 02:20:18.577]  I'm the fart right-wing radio host.
[02:20:19.117 --> 02:20:20.498]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:20.838 --> 02:20:24.581]  He's still got a storefront on Amazon, which we don't promote, but we've got it there.
[02:20:25.121 --> 02:20:28.823]  Only sells a little bit each day, so we can keep all the fake stuff off Amazon.
[02:20:29.224 --> 02:20:31.325]  But they're like, he's still allowed in the marketplace!
[02:20:31.525 --> 02:20:33.286]  He's still allowed to actually fund himself!
[02:20:33.446 --> 02:20:34.247]  What the hell?
[02:20:34.867 --> 02:20:38.270]  Just three years ago, oh, we're not censoring Jones or taking him off things.
[02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:41.512]  Now it's like, how the hell does he even have a bank account or a storefront?
[02:20:43.533 --> 02:20:45.613]  And after they've done it to me, they're going to do it to you.
[02:20:45.633 --> 02:20:46.954]  They're going to do it to everybody.
[02:20:47.814 --> 02:20:51.835]  Meanwhile, big article up on InfoWars.com that they absolutely hate.
[02:20:52.495 --> 02:20:58.016]  Video, Border Patrol Insider Reveals Illegal Alien Sex Offender Arrest Reached 5-Year High.
[02:20:58.076 --> 02:20:58.796]  Of course they do.
[02:20:59.116 --> 02:21:05.877]  New powerful video from Project Veritas that we're magnifying at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:08.018 --> 02:21:09.978]  Without you, we cannot fund our operation.
[02:21:12.179 --> 02:21:13.480]  Such a critical operation.
[02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.501]  So please, InfoWarsStore.com is the big store.
[02:21:16.881 --> 02:21:25.685]  InfoWarsStore.com, that's where you go to get the books, the films, the t-shirts, free shipping ends Wednesday night on the big select items.

[02:21:50.774 --> 02:21:53.076]  All those deals in Wednesday night.
[02:21:53.376 --> 02:21:56.518]  They have to end Wednesday night, because a bunch of them have already sold out.
[02:21:56.538 --> 02:22:00.741]  I mean, everything we offered is still there, but things like Vaso Beats, Alpha Power, Prostagard, all sold out.
[02:22:01.021 --> 02:22:02.221]  We're close to selling out of X3.
[02:22:02.282 --> 02:22:06.004]  People are really finding out what a great product that is, and so much more.
[02:22:06.364 --> 02:22:10.407]  All right, Gerald Salente, the great trends forecaster, my good friend.
[02:22:11.067 --> 02:22:12.368]  It's about to take over.
[02:22:12.408 --> 02:22:15.509]  You do not want to miss him in the next 45 minutes.
[02:22:15.869 --> 02:22:16.890]  He'll be back on the other side.
[02:22:16.930 --> 02:22:19.591]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:22.632]  And as we all get censored and blocked, remember those URLs.
[02:22:22.752 --> 02:22:24.793]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:22:25.554 --> 02:22:26.574]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:22:26.714 --> 02:22:27.755]  Infowars.com.
[02:22:28.075 --> 02:22:29.035]  Newswars.com.
[02:22:29.135 --> 02:22:32.737]  Band.video, where we're getting more and more people that are posting there.
[02:22:33.257 --> 02:22:34.277]  More people that are sharing.
[02:22:34.758 --> 02:22:37.499]  All the censored doctors and scientists exposing COVID as a hoax.
[02:22:37.819 --> 02:22:39.620]  It's all there at Band.video.
[02:22:40.563 --> 02:22:43.744]  Hey, thanks for having me on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:44.784 --> 02:22:53.427]  And as I keep saying, and you better hear it, because if you can't hear it, you got to be, you know, out of your mind.
[02:22:54.627 --> 02:22:57.628]  They're robbing us of our freedom by the second.
[02:22:59.169 --> 02:23:06.131]  Everything we do, where we go, how we do it, when we're doing it, and they're going to go to digital money.
[02:23:07.097 --> 02:23:16.444]  So they know where you spent it, how you spent it, when you spent it, what you spent it on, so they can get every penny that they want, because the politicians don't work.
[02:23:17.104 --> 02:23:20.867]  They just take our money and tell us what to do.
[02:23:21.688 --> 02:23:23.169]  Our freedom is gone!
[02:23:23.189 --> 02:23:25.310]  Finito!
[02:23:26.031 --> 02:23:26.431]  Finished!
[02:23:28.012 --> 02:23:35.818]  Putting out the New Trends Journal, and I was just writing in a reading, you know, one of the articles we're writing about,
[02:23:36.488 --> 02:23:45.615]  Is how the United States now ranks below Mongolia as far as freedoms.
[02:23:46.515 --> 02:23:47.516]  And Argentina.
[02:23:47.536 --> 02:23:50.278]  And I've been to Argentina.
[02:23:52.199 --> 02:23:53.720]  Any kind of place I'd want to live.
[02:23:55.982 --> 02:24:01.126]  So, I'm mentioning this because you really need to support Infowars to keep the truth alive.
[02:24:01.146 --> 02:24:05.329]  Because day after day they're doing what they want to steal it from us.
[02:24:06.687 --> 02:24:08.047]  A robbing us of our rights.
[02:24:09.188 --> 02:24:14.009]  I want to talk a little bit about what's going on in the markets and what to expect.
[02:24:18.009 --> 02:24:24.271]  Investors baffled by soaring stocks in quote monster depression.
[02:24:26.731 --> 02:24:31.312]  Gap between financial markets and global economy yawns wider.
[02:24:32.732 --> 02:24:35.053]  The divergence between the flying stock market
[02:24:35.859 --> 02:24:43.242]  And dying economy is so extreme is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.
[02:24:45.703 --> 02:25:03.489]  The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life on the global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected spurring the IMF to forecast the biggest global recession
[02:25:04.272 --> 02:25:06.093]  Since the 1930s depression.
[02:25:07.393 --> 02:25:08.994]  That's in the Financial Times.
[02:25:11.575 --> 02:25:18.478]  A year ago, April 24th, U.S.
[02:25:18.558 --> 02:25:23.580]  equity valuations reached near two decade high after rally.
[02:25:25.581 --> 02:25:25.781]  U.S.
[02:25:25.801 --> 02:25:29.003]  stock market has surged over the past month despite the damage.
[02:25:29.628 --> 02:25:39.392]  The corporate profits from coronavirus pushing one popular measure of equity valuations to its most expensive in nearly two years.
[02:25:40.752 --> 02:25:52.117]  Corporate earnings are set to tumble this year as economic activity slows, wiping a third from company profits in 2020 compared to last year, Goldman Sachs estimated.
[02:25:52.857 --> 02:25:55.338]  Again, Financial Times, 4-24-2020.
[02:25:55.438 --> 02:25:56.119]  I'm mentioning this
[02:25:59.997 --> 02:26:08.623]  To exemplify the fraud that's right in front of everybody's eyes called the equity markets.
[02:26:09.303 --> 02:26:14.466]  There is absolutely no relationship to Main Street and Wall Street.
[02:26:16.868 --> 02:26:20.190]  Gregory Manorino, you know, the top cats in the field.
[02:26:21.171 --> 02:26:24.633]  You know, of course, he writes for the Trends Journal and he's bought in Infowars.
[02:26:26.034 --> 02:26:27.875]  He shows what's really going on over here.
[02:26:30.791 --> 02:26:33.112]  Why it's going up, why it's not, where it's going.
[02:26:34.012 --> 02:26:35.893]  And we're putting in the magazine each week.
[02:26:36.853 --> 02:26:38.954]  This is a fraud in front of everybody's eyes.
[02:26:38.994 --> 02:26:41.475]  Today, gold is down pretty sharply.
[02:26:42.496 --> 02:26:45.917]  Just above the $1,700 an ounce level.
[02:26:46.417 --> 02:26:49.178]  Meanwhile, Bitcoin took another big spike.
[02:26:50.359 --> 02:26:51.059]  Silver's down.
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:58.802]  How could Bitcoin go up and silver go down?
[02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:00.691]  And gold go down.
[02:27:02.412 --> 02:27:11.018]  Because the reason why people are going into the cryptocurrencies, and again, now that the bigs are playing that market, and the whole game is rigged.
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:15.001]  It's rigged right in front of everybody's eyes.
[02:27:15.642 --> 02:27:18.844]  If you don't believe me, go back to 2020.
[02:27:18.944 --> 02:27:21.426]  That's not ancient history.
[02:27:21.446 --> 02:27:25.389]  And they find the gold, the JPMorgan Chase gang.
[02:27:26.035 --> 02:27:33.698]  Like this is their fourth time that they've got hit for these kind of different frauds for rigging the precious metals market.
[02:27:35.299 --> 02:27:37.080]  So it's right in front of everybody's eyes.
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.401]  So now the bigs are playing the Bitcoin market.
[02:27:41.802 --> 02:27:44.023]  Bitcoin isn't there, it's up in the air.
[02:27:46.044 --> 02:27:47.924]  And we just kept saying it was going to rise.
[02:27:47.944 --> 02:27:51.546]  You go back to our Trends Journal this past June.
[02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:57.478]  Bitcoin was trading at around $10,000 a coin.
[02:27:58.739 --> 02:28:03.460]  And we said when it solidifies over $10,000, it's going to shoot higher.
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:04.240]  And it has.
[02:28:04.961 --> 02:28:13.063]  So the money going into the cryptos isn't going into the precious metals market.
[02:28:18.005 --> 02:28:19.105]  Does it make any sense?
[02:28:20.478 --> 02:28:43.095]  It makes as much sense as me reading to you two articles from Financial Times last year of why the market should not be going up, why the valuations are way out of line, and now more lockdown fear.
[02:28:44.517 --> 02:28:46.898]  We just heard our hour.
[02:28:48.676 --> 02:29:04.800]  Our CDC, not mine, head, what's her name, Walensky or something, warning us to be very scared.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:07.140]  Impending doom!
[02:29:07.621 --> 02:29:09.121]  Whoa!
[02:29:09.821 --> 02:29:10.761]  Whoa!
[02:29:11.061 --> 02:29:14.622]  Hey, why don't you go shove it with your doom crap?
[02:29:14.982 --> 02:29:18.003]  Hey, hey, CDC director,
[02:29:19.997 --> 02:29:21.277]  How about F.U.C.?
[02:29:21.297 --> 02:29:22.018]  You know what?
[02:29:22.558 --> 02:29:22.818]  Yeah.
[02:29:24.018 --> 02:29:28.699]  Look at this clown stuff they got with these people doing his hand job on the way he's showing.
[02:29:28.979 --> 02:29:31.820]  Can't you put script down the bottom and tell us what she's saying?
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:37.082]  No, we got to pay for some clown to do a hand job in front of our face.
[02:29:37.442 --> 02:29:42.043]  But anyway, you go back to the CDC director selling gloom.
[02:29:42.923 --> 02:29:45.064]  Hey, this is in your Trends Journal this week.
[02:29:45.204 --> 02:29:46.444]  It's coming out tomorrow.
[02:29:50.003 --> 02:30:02.814]  On March 2nd, the day that Governor Abbott of Texas announced that they were opening up completely, the state had a 7-day average of 4,900 cases.
[02:30:03.895 --> 02:30:06.197]  The state's 7-day average last week?
[02:30:06.217 --> 02:30:06.197]  3,400.
[02:30:07.238 --> 02:30:11.401]  Hey, CDC, you're too stupid to count?
[02:30:13.263 --> 02:30:14.244]  Oh, what are you?
[02:30:15.285 --> 02:30:16.646]  Out of his mind, Biden?
[02:30:17.307 --> 02:30:19.348]  Saying that there were Neanderthals?
[02:30:19.689 --> 02:30:20.790]  Guess what, Biden?
[02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:26.434]  A Neanderthal has more brains than you inside out, and they're dead a long time ago.
[02:30:27.315 --> 02:30:28.856]  How about looking at the facts?
[02:30:29.477 --> 02:30:31.138]  No, Salenti, calm down.
[02:30:31.499 --> 02:30:35.021]  Oh, and by the way, I love these people who say, don't use vulgar language.
[02:30:35.342 --> 02:30:40.286]  Yeah, I gotta use the crap that they shove down your throat and you swallow it?
[02:30:42.665 --> 02:30:50.291]  The CDC is selling gloom and they ignore the fact what's going on in Texas, what's going on in Florida.
[02:30:50.631 --> 02:31:00.819]  Oh, by the way, cases are rising here in New York that was locked down by murderer Cuomo who took sick people out of the hospitals and put them in nursing homes.
[02:31:01.139 --> 02:31:02.040]  We're going to be right back.
[02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:06.043]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:07.325 --> 02:31:11.287]  And as I keep saying, you see what's going on in front of your eyes.
[02:31:11.347 --> 02:31:13.327]  Censorship, censorship, censorship.
[02:31:13.707 --> 02:31:25.512]  You know, last week they had the, you know, they had that guy Dorsey and, what's his name, Paichi, whatever his name is, Alphabet, and Zuckerberg.
[02:31:25.952 --> 02:31:32.395]  And they had the three photos of these guys, you know, showing them at the hearings.
[02:31:34.443 --> 02:31:40.007]  And you look at the photos of these three guys, one after another, they're from another planet.
[02:31:41.127 --> 02:31:41.968]  They're not human.
[02:31:42.929 --> 02:31:45.170]  You look at them, who made these guys up?
[02:31:47.552 --> 02:31:50.734]  You know, the King James Bible said, the meek shall inherit the earth.
[02:31:50.774 --> 02:31:51.534]  They got it wrong.
[02:31:51.574 --> 02:31:53.195]  The geeks have inherited the earth.
[02:31:53.956 --> 02:31:54.276]  Look at them.
[02:31:54.756 --> 02:31:55.557]  Look at these guys.
[02:31:56.157 --> 02:31:56.998]  Look at them!
[02:31:58.010 --> 02:32:08.738]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea look up to these pieces of monopolistic garbage?
[02:32:09.839 --> 02:32:16.224]  Telling, could you imagine them telling me what I should think and say and believe?
[02:32:16.664 --> 02:32:19.166]  How about go shove it, Junior!
[02:32:20.267 --> 02:32:21.447]  Oh yeah, come over here!
[02:32:22.268 --> 02:32:23.709]  Come over here and tell me what to do.
[02:32:24.530 --> 02:32:26.031]  No, we'll censor you.
[02:32:26.664 --> 02:32:29.606]  You will not be allowed to say what you want to say.
[02:32:30.167 --> 02:32:31.188]  We're in charge.
[02:32:31.528 --> 02:32:34.330]  I'm mentioning this because you need to support InfoWars.
[02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:36.832]  You need to keep the truth alive.
[02:32:37.112 --> 02:32:39.854]  And you can do it by buying their great products.
[02:32:40.234 --> 02:32:41.315]  And I buy them too.
[02:32:41.896 --> 02:32:46.940]  I put my money where my heart is.
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:49.181]  I love the super male vitality.
[02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:50.862]  Gives me that extra boost.
[02:32:51.523 --> 02:32:52.904]  Especially when I need it.
[02:32:54.785 --> 02:32:55.166]  Anyway.
[02:32:56.283 --> 02:32:58.144]  They got a mega blowout sale going on.
[02:32:58.164 --> 02:33:04.085]  50% off plus free shipping on a number of their top selling products.
[02:33:04.165 --> 02:33:05.506]  And there's only three days left.
[02:33:06.346 --> 02:33:11.568]  So, they knew when they launched this mega blowout sale that the items weren't going to last long.
[02:33:12.248 --> 02:33:16.709]  And less than a full week into promotion, they were already starting to see products run out.
[02:33:17.029 --> 02:33:18.390]  The Vaso Beats sold out.
[02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:20.090]  The Alpha Powers now sold out.
[02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:22.951]  Prostagard now sold out.
[02:33:23.812 --> 02:33:29.795]  So because more of these items are selling out, you're adding a few new items to the blowout sale.
[02:33:30.336 --> 02:33:34.498]  And you can get Living Defense Plus, 50% off, plus free shipping.
[02:33:35.038 --> 02:33:46.485]  All-Iodine products, Survival Shield X2, Survival Shield X2 Spray, Survival Shield X3, and Iodine Service Spray, 50% off, plus, of course, free shipping.
[02:33:47.025 --> 02:33:51.588]  And you can still save 50% off and get free shipping on these other great items.
[02:33:51.928 --> 02:33:53.289]  But you need to act fast.
[02:33:53.993 --> 02:33:57.857]  Because these things are going in order today because they're selling out fast.
[02:33:58.237 --> 02:34:10.568]  You got Brain Force Plus, and Dr. Jones Charcoal Toothpaste, Dr. Jones Charcoal Mouthwash, Dr. Jones Extra Strength Cover Chill,
[02:34:11.152 --> 02:34:12.153]  We're good to go.
[02:34:39.522 --> 02:34:42.484]  You better do it now because you're not going to be there when you need it.
[02:34:42.985 --> 02:34:43.906]  And you need it now.
[02:34:44.066 --> 02:34:46.227]  And you need to keep InfoWars alive.
[02:34:47.488 --> 02:34:51.452]  And of course, you know, we're doing the same thing on our end with the Trends Journal.
[02:34:51.472 --> 02:34:53.633]  There's no other magazine like it in the world.
[02:34:53.734 --> 02:34:56.015]  Anybody could show me one that comes close.
[02:34:56.796 --> 02:34:57.637]  Let me look at it.
[02:34:58.117 --> 02:35:02.761]  I'd love to see it because nobody has a trend forecasting record like mine.
[02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:05.303]  My books Trends 2000.
[02:35:07.925 --> 02:35:09.026]  National bestseller.
[02:35:10.171 --> 02:35:13.232]  Trend tracking far better than Megatrends Time Magazine.
[02:35:14.172 --> 02:35:16.873]  Been writing the Trends Journal since 1991.
[02:35:17.473 --> 02:35:19.934]  So, show me your data and we could talk.
[02:35:20.294 --> 02:35:22.574]  And I'm mentioning this for one reason.
[02:35:23.334 --> 02:35:27.796]  I see what the future looks like, and it's hell on earth the way they're taking us there.
[02:35:28.856 --> 02:35:32.777]  And if we don't fight back for our freedom, it's just gonna keep getting worse.
[02:35:34.364 --> 02:35:41.189]  Look at the low-life pieces of garbage scum clowns around the world telling us what to do.
[02:35:41.229 --> 02:35:46.932]  You know, when they were saying, oh, you know, they're pumping up the COVID war to get rid of Trump, I said, that's a lot of baloney.
[02:35:47.373 --> 02:35:48.673]  They're doing it all over the world.
[02:35:50.415 --> 02:35:51.756]  They're doing it all over the world.
[02:35:52.496 --> 02:35:56.599]  Look what happened this last weekend over there in the UK.
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.003]  When you heard this little clown guy shooting off his mount,
[02:36:04.079 --> 02:36:09.884]  Telling people not to hug and kiss their loved ones.
[02:36:10.804 --> 02:36:11.145]  You ready?
[02:36:12.145 --> 02:36:14.007]  See if they got their tape over here, you can play it.
[02:36:16.125 --> 02:36:23.229]  Please don't risk the health of your loved one by actually hugging them and risk the spread of the disease.
[02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:27.291]  And of course, when you're hugging somebody, you're in incredibly close proximity to them.
[02:36:27.651 --> 02:36:29.872]  So please, again, just be sensible.
[02:36:30.052 --> 02:36:31.273]  Everybody does know the rules.
[02:36:31.333 --> 02:36:32.774]  I think actually we've been through this.
[02:36:32.834 --> 02:36:34.055]  Most people do know the rules.
[02:36:34.375 --> 02:36:35.075]  We know what to do.
[02:36:35.095 --> 02:36:35.976]  We know how to behave.
[02:36:36.256 --> 02:36:44.040]  And also, if you see somebody behaving in a slightly odd way, then maybe call them out on it in a respectful way, because sometimes some people just forget.
[02:36:44.645 --> 02:36:44.965]  Really?
[02:36:45.505 --> 02:36:46.085]  What would you say?
[02:36:46.145 --> 02:36:46.926]  How would you handle that?
[02:36:48.526 --> 02:36:52.827]  Well, if you see a loved one, say, look, let's just be a little bit more careful here.
[02:36:53.607 --> 02:36:56.328]  Sorry, love to give you a hug, but not at the moment.
[02:36:56.428 --> 02:36:58.808]  I think people are sensible about this, actually.
[02:36:58.828 --> 02:37:01.049]  You do see people, actually, a little bit with caution.
[02:37:01.069 --> 02:37:04.509]  You see people all the time kind of getting close to each other and then suddenly thinking, well, you know what?
[02:37:04.589 --> 02:37:05.290]  I can't do that.
[02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:06.430]  Let's just keep a distance.
[02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:11.211]  I know it's a little bit awkward, but actually, in these circumstances, it's the right thing to do.
[02:37:13.075 --> 02:37:15.016]  Look at that little freak!
[02:37:15.496 --> 02:37:18.637]  Look at that little garbage boy and nothing!
[02:37:19.097 --> 02:37:22.178]  Come over here and tell me not to hug somebody!
[02:37:22.679 --> 02:37:24.859]  You stupid little piece of crap!
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.460]  Oh, Salenti, calm down!
[02:37:27.821 --> 02:37:29.521]  Don't use words like crap!
[02:37:29.761 --> 02:37:32.322]  You have to be proper like English-speak!
[02:37:32.662 --> 02:37:33.883]  Look at that little jerk!
[02:37:34.503 --> 02:37:35.483]  Look at that little jerk!
[02:37:36.484 --> 02:37:39.785]  Hugging, you get incredibly close proximity.
[02:37:40.465 --> 02:37:42.126]  You're no, no, no kidding!
[02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:43.910]  Hugging?
[02:37:46.211 --> 02:37:46.992]  The rules?
[02:37:47.752 --> 02:37:48.332]  What rules?
[02:37:48.372 --> 02:37:50.933]  You're making this crap up, you moron!
[02:37:52.594 --> 02:37:55.135]  Who's dying from this, imbecile?
[02:37:56.236 --> 02:37:57.756]  Oh, over there in the UK?
[02:37:58.597 --> 02:37:59.137]  What was it?
[02:37:59.557 --> 02:38:04.959]  I think about 377 people under the age of 65 or under the age of 55 died of the virus over a year period.
[02:38:12.333 --> 02:38:17.556]  Over there in Canada, with that little lowlife, another daddy's boy, can't stand these.
[02:38:17.836 --> 02:38:21.978]  I bet this little clown boy, he comes from a family that got him in there too.
[02:38:22.978 --> 02:38:25.180]  You're all a member of a club and you're not in it.
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:28.441]  Look at that jerk he got up there running Canada, Trudeau.
[02:38:28.801 --> 02:38:30.062]  True nothing about him.
[02:38:30.542 --> 02:38:33.103]  He'd be nobody if daddy wasn't there before him.
[02:38:33.364 --> 02:38:40.227]  Just like murderers George W. Bush, murderer Cuomo over here that took people out of hospitals and put them in nursing homes.
[02:38:40.587 --> 02:38:41.708]  All daddy's boys.
[02:38:42.686 --> 02:38:48.229]  Look at the clown they got up there, telling us what to do up in Canada.
[02:38:49.490 --> 02:38:50.891]  Teresa Lamb.
[02:38:53.613 --> 02:39:03.438]  Telling people, when you have sex, make sure you wear a mask.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:07.621]  I guess you haven't had any in a long time.
[02:39:08.601 --> 02:39:11.223]  Well, maybe, uh, you and yo- I got it!
[02:39:11.683 --> 02:39:13.984]  Why don't you and Rachel get together?
[02:39:14.405 --> 02:39:16.106]  Our health secretary!
[02:39:16.566 --> 02:39:19.047]  Telling me, again, you'd be a perfect match!
[02:39:19.708 --> 02:39:21.809]  You and Lola- Rachel Levin!
[02:39:21.829 --> 02:39:22.890]  Yeah, the U.S.
[02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:24.831]  health secretary, and Lam.
[02:39:25.311 --> 02:39:25.531]  Yeah.
[02:39:25.992 --> 02:39:27.332]  Both- Look at them!
[02:39:27.813 --> 02:39:29.574]  These people telling us about health.
[02:39:32.736 --> 02:39:34.137]  You realize it's- Look at this!
[02:39:34.337 --> 02:39:34.717]  Look at this!
[02:39:35.589 --> 02:39:38.171]  Oh, and they're proud that they picked a transgender.
[02:39:38.371 --> 02:39:41.253]  How about being proud for picking the right, best person?
[02:39:41.473 --> 02:39:43.615]  This guy's got more chins than Chinatown.
[02:39:43.795 --> 02:39:44.996]  Oh, he's not a guy, he's a girl.
[02:39:45.076 --> 02:39:45.997]  I'm sorry, alright.
[02:39:46.497 --> 02:39:46.737]  Yeah.
[02:39:47.418 --> 02:39:48.899]  What a freak show!
[02:39:49.499 --> 02:39:51.681]  One after another telling us what to do!
[02:39:52.261 --> 02:39:53.242]  Facts don't matter.
[02:39:53.602 --> 02:39:54.363]  Shove the facts.
[02:39:54.563 --> 02:39:55.423]  We're in charge.
[02:39:56.064 --> 02:39:57.565]  You better support InfoWars.
[02:39:58.266 --> 02:39:59.366]  You better do what you can.
[02:40:00.147 --> 02:40:02.729]  Because we gotta fight for our freedom, they're robbing it from us.
[02:40:03.516 --> 02:40:06.097]  We had a clown show right in front of our face.
[02:40:07.337 --> 02:40:08.938]  Look at this little nothing of a clown.
[02:40:10.138 --> 02:40:12.839]  You call this guy out, he wouldn't know what to do.
[02:40:13.199 --> 02:40:17.881]  Oh, he says that you should call people out when they're not obeying the law.
[02:40:17.921 --> 02:40:18.401]  What law?
[02:40:18.421 --> 02:40:20.062]  You're making this garbage up.
[02:40:21.122 --> 02:40:22.803]  There's no scientific data.
[02:40:23.263 --> 02:40:24.843]  Oh, remember it was six feet away?
[02:40:25.003 --> 02:40:26.584]  Oh, now it's only three feet away.
[02:40:28.224 --> 02:40:29.005]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:29.285 --> 02:40:30.005]  Don't go away.
[02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:33.612]  Hello, hello, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:33.632 --> 02:40:50.426]  You know, I was mentioning before about our, the person running the CDC, you know, selling this gloom, this gloom and doom coming up, and telling us, you know, we all have to lock down and be, you know, hear it.
[02:40:50.446 --> 02:40:53.788]  All right, this is from Associated Press.
[02:40:56.250 --> 02:40:56.610]  Sunday.
[02:40:56.771 --> 02:40:57.912]  This is in ancient history.
[02:40:57.972 --> 02:40:59.753]  This is like yesterday.
[02:41:01.966 --> 02:41:10.252]  A year after becoming a global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, New York and New Jersey are back atop the list of U.S.
[02:41:10.312 --> 02:41:12.794]  states with the highest rate of infection.
[02:41:13.335 --> 02:41:15.356]  Okay, can we stop right there?
[02:41:16.157 --> 02:41:23.342]  Look at the little low-life pieces of garbage scum crap running New York and running New Jersey!
[02:41:24.223 --> 02:41:24.543]  Yeah!
[02:41:26.825 --> 02:41:29.407]  Andy, where did you have your hands last Cuomo?
[02:41:30.805 --> 02:41:48.298]  And a little freak of a nothing clown of a jerk, gutless wonder, you wonder who he is, little boy Murphy over there in Jersey, gotta lock down the places, New York City is dead!
[02:41:49.799 --> 02:41:52.221]  Most of New York State is dead!
[02:41:54.289 --> 02:41:55.829]  You go out at night, man.
[02:41:55.869 --> 02:41:57.810]  You go into midtown New York.
[02:41:58.210 --> 02:41:58.570]  Yeah.
[02:41:59.110 --> 02:42:05.972]  You want to see a homeless scene and an ugly scene and a filthy, rotten, dirty scene?
[02:42:06.472 --> 02:42:07.933]  Go to New York City.
[02:42:08.953 --> 02:42:12.014]  Own a clown boy that they got playing mayor.
[02:42:12.574 --> 02:42:14.895]  Another guy that's never worked a day in his life.
[02:42:15.195 --> 02:42:16.755]  A piece of scum.
[02:42:17.816 --> 02:42:18.836]  Arrogant boy.
[02:42:20.096 --> 02:42:22.377]  Yeah, he goes by the name de Blasio.
[02:42:23.723 --> 02:42:25.503]  His real name is Wilhelm.
[02:42:26.304 --> 02:42:26.964]  That's right.
[02:42:28.004 --> 02:42:29.924]  His real last name is Wilhelm.
[02:42:30.244 --> 02:42:34.485]  The slimy little arrogant... Oh, there's that moron Murphy.
[02:42:35.025 --> 02:42:36.546]  Moron Murphy, huh?
[02:42:38.466 --> 02:42:40.926]  Yeah, anyway, de Blasio uses the Wilhelm.
[02:42:41.306 --> 02:42:42.207]  Forget the Wilhelm.
[02:42:42.227 --> 02:42:43.267]  Forget his real name.
[02:42:43.987 --> 02:42:47.428]  He didn't get the Italian votes because a lot of Italian-Americans in New York.
[02:42:47.808 --> 02:42:48.268]  And it worked.
[02:42:48.928 --> 02:42:49.228]  Anyway.
[02:42:50.689 --> 02:43:08.016]  Now you got the CDC shooting a mount off about more restrictions when New York and Jersey were total... They destroyed the restaurant business.
[02:43:09.217 --> 02:43:10.497]  They made up this garbage.
[02:43:11.178 --> 02:43:13.759]  You gotta be, when you sit down, you can wear a mask.
[02:43:14.259 --> 02:43:16.740]  But when you stand up, you gotta put the mask on when you're eating.
[02:43:17.478 --> 02:43:20.260]  And you gotta be six feet apart, but then we're gonna change it to three feet apart.
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:23.522]  Because we're just making this crap up because we're a bunch of crap heads.
[02:43:24.463 --> 02:43:30.026]  Just like they had me as a kid hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off during the Cold War.
[02:43:30.206 --> 02:43:31.807]  Like that was gonna make a difference in your life.
[02:43:32.548 --> 02:43:32.728]  So.
[02:43:34.369 --> 02:43:34.809]  Here we go.
[02:43:35.810 --> 02:43:44.676]  Even as the vaccination campaign is ramped up, the number of new infections in New Jersey has crept up by 37 percent in a little more than a month.
[02:43:46.577 --> 02:43:46.677]  And
[02:43:47.392 --> 02:43:51.455]  About 54,000 people in New York tested positive for the virus in the last week.
[02:43:52.216 --> 02:43:54.938]  A number that's been going up.
[02:43:55.198 --> 02:43:55.459]  All right?
[02:43:55.699 --> 02:44:00.783]  The two states now rank number one and two in new infections per capita among U.S.
[02:44:00.803 --> 02:44:01.183]  states.
[02:44:04.025 --> 02:44:04.326]  All right?
[02:44:05.487 --> 02:44:06.287]  It's not working.
[02:44:09.890 --> 02:44:10.491]  Not working.
[02:44:11.091 --> 02:44:16.876]  Oh, and that daddy's boy over here, arrogant Andy,
[02:44:17.512 --> 02:44:28.159]  Cuomo, when he put the restrictions on the restaurants again last December, the day he did it, he said the infection rate in restaurants is 1.4%.
[02:44:28.819 --> 02:44:31.161]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:44:31.741 --> 02:44:37.745]  Hey, Junior, I'm not really good at math, but 1.4% equals nothing!
[02:44:41.127 --> 02:44:43.028]  I don't care that it equals nothing!
[02:44:44.492 --> 02:44:47.593]  I'm the, uh, the Governor!
[02:44:47.953 --> 02:44:49.934]  I'm the daddy's boy, you got it!
[02:44:49.954 --> 02:44:55.276]  I'm gonna rename the Tappan Zee Bridge after my daddy, the Mario Cuomo Bridge!
[02:44:55.556 --> 02:45:02.318]  And you, you little cilenti and the rest of these that pay all these moronic taxes, you gotta pay for the name change.
[02:45:04.439 --> 02:45:05.819]  So I don't care about the facts.
[02:45:06.519 --> 02:45:08.140]  I got executive orders!
[02:45:08.968 --> 02:45:14.950]  And again, we wrote about how he gave himself those things in March of last year, when no one was dying.
[02:45:16.251 --> 02:45:18.572]  They're crazy people that are in charge.
[02:45:19.852 --> 02:45:25.915]  They're psychopaths, sociopaths, pathological liars, liars, freaks and fools are running our world.
[02:45:27.055 --> 02:45:36.979]  So, you got over there the Italian Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, over there in Italy, a bankster, a bankster mobster.
[02:45:38.686 --> 02:45:43.009]  Worked for the World Bank, headed the Italian bank.
[02:45:44.029 --> 02:45:47.891]  He was the head of the Goldman Sachs gang, running the European division.
[02:45:48.472 --> 02:45:59.238]  And his last position before taking over was the head of the European Central Bank, which has dumped in trillions of dollars buying up, they call it quantitative easing.
[02:45:59.258 --> 02:46:01.739]  What a stupid word, quantitative easing.
[02:46:02.179 --> 02:46:04.501]  Buying up junk bonds and government bonds.
[02:46:05.433 --> 02:46:16.501]  Enriching corporations, bringing interest rates to negative, so we the little people can't put our money in a savings account and get interest on it, but the gamblers can keep gambling because they give money for nothing.
[02:46:17.562 --> 02:46:20.884]  And the bigs can keep getting bigger because they can keep borrowing more money for nothing.
[02:46:21.825 --> 02:46:30.631]  He comes out and he just told government that they would take action against any health care worker that refuses to get vaccinated.
[02:46:31.832 --> 02:46:32.232]  That's right.
[02:46:34.502 --> 02:46:37.164]  And they have that AstraZeneca vaccine over there.
[02:46:38.284 --> 02:46:41.466]  That a number of countries, including Norway and Sweden, won't use.
[02:46:44.949 --> 02:46:50.812]  Because of the blood clots and other effects that they've been showing to have.
[02:46:52.333 --> 02:46:55.735]  So now, he's telling people they have to get vaccinated.
[02:46:56.976 --> 02:47:00.778]  Who is this piece of crap to tell people what to do?
[02:47:01.119 --> 02:47:02.960]  Does anybody get it anymore?
[02:47:04.170 --> 02:47:21.459]  How could you be on this earth and take orders from politicians, politics that suck the blood and life out of us, and the other people that make up this crap called bureaucrats?
[02:47:22.259 --> 02:47:23.600]  They spelt it wrong.
[02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:26.481]  They're bureau craps.
[02:47:27.141 --> 02:47:34.305]  They're pieces of crap that could never get a job in the real world that are part of the political system.
[02:47:35.166 --> 02:47:35.586]  Got it?
[02:47:38.147 --> 02:47:39.108]  You don't believe me?
[02:47:39.808 --> 02:47:41.329]  Hey, look at Lola.
[02:47:41.409 --> 02:47:43.850]  L-O-L-A, Lola.
[02:47:43.970 --> 02:47:52.735]  Yeah, the guy who's our health secretary over there that Biden brought in, Rachel Levin.
[02:47:55.950 --> 02:48:05.478]  They're nothing more than people that don't deserve to get what they're being paid.
[02:48:06.759 --> 02:48:08.821]  California in trouble.
[02:48:08.861 --> 02:48:17.288]  340,000 public employees with $100,000 plus paychecks cost taxpayers $45 billion.
[02:48:17.729 --> 02:48:20.091]  Ready for this one?
[02:48:20.771 --> 02:48:21.632]  Here's from Forbes.
[02:48:22.973 --> 02:48:23.614]  Top paid
[02:48:24.249 --> 02:48:27.170]  Los Angeles lifeguards, you ready?
[02:48:28.011 --> 02:48:29.091]  Earned up to $390,000, almost $400,000.
[02:48:29.131 --> 02:48:29.551]  $400,000 a year in 2019.
[02:48:29.591 --> 02:48:31.952]  We got this arrogant little boy over here.
[02:48:31.992 --> 02:48:34.733]  What an arrogant, arrogant, arrogant!
[02:48:34.753 --> 02:48:36.074]  And I'll tell him to his face.
[02:48:46.499 --> 02:48:51.980]  The guy to play superintendent of schools over here in Kingston that makes well over $200,000.
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:54.841]  And I'm paying for this.
[02:48:56.321 --> 02:48:58.021]  For a lousy school system.
[02:48:58.382 --> 02:49:01.762]  The whole public school system stinks!
[02:49:03.123 --> 02:49:10.424]  All it is is brainwashing crap and we gotta pay these public servants, right?
[02:49:10.764 --> 02:49:12.165]  What public servants?
[02:49:12.585 --> 02:49:13.825]  They don't serve us!
[02:49:14.810 --> 02:49:18.891]  They steal our money and tell us what to do!
[02:49:21.911 --> 02:49:23.012]  End of story.
[02:49:23.032 --> 02:49:25.132]  There we go.
[02:49:25.632 --> 02:49:28.593]  Take the vaccine and do not question what's in it.
[02:49:29.193 --> 02:49:31.153]  I remember her shooting a mouth off.
[02:49:32.554 --> 02:49:33.734]  New York official.
[02:49:34.194 --> 02:49:36.434]  An official piece of crap!
[02:49:37.375 --> 02:49:38.175]  Official.
[02:49:38.195 --> 02:49:41.836]  Oh, and you know the other word I can't stand anymore?
[02:49:42.376 --> 02:49:43.436]  Celebrities.
[02:49:44.699 --> 02:49:46.280]  What are you talking about?
[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:47.881]  You know how to put on an act!
[02:49:48.701 --> 02:49:49.662]  A celebrity!
[02:49:50.002 --> 02:49:52.403]  Oh yeah, but I can throw a basketball into a hoop!
[02:49:52.823 --> 02:49:54.284]  Take it easy, man!
[02:49:55.144 --> 02:49:56.085]  Celebrities!
[02:49:56.165 --> 02:49:57.966]  Can't you see what they're doing to us?
[02:49:59.907 --> 02:50:01.808]  Now is the time to fight for freedom!
[02:50:02.421 --> 02:50:04.922]  They're robbing us from by the minute.
[02:50:05.483 --> 02:50:08.404]  Hey, they passed the passport law over here in New York.
[02:50:08.484 --> 02:50:09.165]  Cuomo did.
[02:50:09.545 --> 02:50:11.566]  You won't be able to go to concerts and things.
[02:50:12.046 --> 02:50:13.447]  They're gonna keep doing it more and more.
[02:50:13.467 --> 02:50:14.888]  They did it in Israel already.
[02:50:14.908 --> 02:50:18.670]  Yeah, oh yeah, stars who receive coronavirus.
[02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:19.330]  Star?
[02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:20.671]  What star?
[02:50:20.991 --> 02:50:22.432]  You're a dope piece of crap.
[02:50:22.472 --> 02:50:23.452]  Get a real job.
[02:50:23.652 --> 02:50:24.693]  You're an actor.
[02:50:27.574 --> 02:50:29.095]  Look at that clown De Niro.
[02:50:29.415 --> 02:50:30.536]  He's not far from here.
[02:50:31.932 --> 02:50:34.035]  Down in Gardner, not far from Kingston.
[02:50:34.576 --> 02:50:38.181]  Yeah, remember they banned the anti-vax movement at the Tribeca Festival?
[02:50:39.243 --> 02:50:40.504]  Keep the truth alive!
[02:50:41.025 --> 02:50:42.347]  Support InfoWars!
[02:50:42.948 --> 02:50:46.072]  Subscribe to the Trends Journal, read history before it happens.
[02:50:47.094 --> 02:50:47.855]  See you next week.
[02:50:52.611 --> 02:50:57.395]  Remember, only way the dog hunts is you share the links for Bandot Video, InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com.
[02:50:57.415 --> 02:51:00.298]  And I'll throw this out again, because when I plug, we're able to fund our operation.
[02:51:00.318 --> 02:51:02.300]  When I don't, we're close to being shut down.
[02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:03.961]  I'm not trying to be a victim here.
[02:51:03.981 --> 02:51:06.323]  I'm one hell of a fighter, and I've been blessed to be in this fight this long.
[02:51:06.744 --> 02:51:11.208]  But if you don't buy the products, we can't fight effectively, and the enemy will successfully shut us down.
[02:51:11.288 --> 02:51:14.431]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on people don't even know about.
[02:51:14.551 --> 02:51:18.854]  And let's just say this, you see Info Wars, well we're doing a lot more than what you see there.
[02:51:18.974 --> 02:51:21.416]  The enemy's got all my phones tapped, they know what we're doing, it's all legal.
[02:51:22.117 --> 02:51:23.478]  But believe me, we've only begun to fight.
[02:51:23.858 --> 02:51:25.760]  I need a lot of capital if you want to win this fight.
[02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:30.084]  You can't spend your money anywhere that's got more bang for the buck.
[02:51:30.624 --> 02:51:31.245]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:31.565 --> 02:51:32.246]  Dollar for dollar.
[02:51:32.266 --> 02:51:32.906]  Pound for pound.
[02:51:32.966 --> 02:51:36.089]  We're the toughest, meanest, hardcore junkyard dog there is.
[02:51:36.450 --> 02:51:37.351]  Powered by God.
[02:51:37.391 --> 02:51:39.733]  You know, the Energizer bunnies powered by Energizer.
[02:51:39.773 --> 02:51:40.674]  We're powered by God.
[02:51:41.034 --> 02:51:41.675]  We're pathetic.
[02:51:41.955 --> 02:51:43.457]  This is just a flesh bag.
[02:51:43.757 --> 02:51:48.261]  I've got this little pathetic spirit that was made by God and I can see God and God shines through me.
[02:51:48.562 --> 02:51:49.382]  God shines through you.
[02:51:50.523 --> 02:51:53.484]  But I need a platform to attack, and I just want to attack the enemy with truth.
[02:51:53.584 --> 02:51:55.845]  So, please, you've got my commitment to go 110%.
[02:51:55.885 --> 02:52:06.810]  Sometimes I'm going to fall, sometimes I'm going to fail, sometimes I'm going to stumble, sometimes I'm going to blow up, sometimes I'm going to make a fool out of myself, because I'm real, and I'm a sinner, but I love God, and I love justice, and I need capital to fight this war.
[02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:15.254]  So, Vitamineral Fusion is the one thing, if you do anything, for you, for your children, especially if you've got grandparents or parents that are retired or in a nursing home that aren't getting a lot of sun.
[02:52:15.294 --> 02:52:17.736]  You know, the old smart old ladies and old men are out there gardening.
[02:52:17.776 --> 02:52:19.176]  Those are the guys that look like 100 years old.
[02:52:19.236 --> 02:52:21.598]  Well, if you're not getting your D3, you're going to be dead in a hammer.
[02:52:21.618 --> 02:52:22.878]  This has great D3.
[02:52:22.898 --> 02:52:24.659]  It's got all the other essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:52:24.679 --> 02:52:28.681]  96% reviews at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:52:28.801 --> 02:52:29.582]  It's back in stock 50%
[02:52:30.182 --> 02:52:30.562]  I think so.
[02:52:58.464 --> 02:53:01.625]  You already saw the Roger Stone interview in Florida, got some other big ones coming up.
[02:53:01.926 --> 02:53:04.587]  We're busy beavers here, and you'll see it all here at the InfoWars.
[02:53:04.707 --> 02:53:08.529]  We believe in peace, so we are bringing you the war of information.
[02:53:08.569 --> 02:53:13.671]  And if you do attempt to shut our speech down and attack us, we will defend ourselves!
[02:53:13.911 --> 02:53:16.712]  InfoWars!
[02:53:16.812 --> 02:53:18.073]  InfoWars!
[02:53:18.413 --> 02:53:20.954]  InfoWars!
[02:53:22.895 --> 02:53:24.256]  Well, we knew this news was coming.
[02:53:25.123 --> 02:53:28.105]  So I'm not pleased to be proven right yet again, but here it is.
[02:53:28.726 --> 02:53:30.147]  I've got CNBC.
[02:53:30.367 --> 02:53:31.768]  I've got CNBC.
[02:53:32.008 --> 02:53:33.389]  I've got the New York Post.
[02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:35.231]  I mean, I've got them all right here.
[02:53:36.672 --> 02:53:37.993]  And they say, oh, guess what?
[02:53:38.753 --> 02:53:39.854]  It's not a pandemic.
[02:53:40.875 --> 02:53:41.815]  It's endemic.
[02:53:42.776 --> 02:53:46.199]  They say America is racist and white people are inherently bad.
[02:53:46.739 --> 02:53:49.041]  Racism is endemic amongst them.
[02:53:49.974 --> 02:53:53.836]  Which is total racism by the establishment, by the left, trying to create a race war.
[02:53:54.657 --> 02:54:01.421]  Martin Luther King was right when he said, you judge people by the character of what they do and the content of their deeds.
[02:54:01.801 --> 02:54:02.982]  You don't do it off what color they are.
[02:54:03.022 --> 02:54:04.163]  But that's what they're saying.
[02:54:04.223 --> 02:54:07.464]  Well, now they're saying COVID's endemic.
[02:54:07.525 --> 02:54:13.088]  It's a common cold virus that Bill Gates manipulated and patented so he owns it with Fauci and the UN.
[02:54:14.329 --> 02:54:16.030]  And so the vaccines aren't going to work.
[02:54:16.718 --> 02:54:21.636]  And it's never going to go away and Fauci said last week and Bill Gates said this week that you still won't be able to go outside.
[02:54:22.597 --> 02:54:27.878]  Or go have a job or anything, because if one person dies of COVID in New Zealand or the U.S.
[02:54:27.898 --> 02:54:29.618]  or the U.K., no one can ever go outside again.
[02:54:30.339 --> 02:54:41.481]  People have always died of the flu and always died of the cold, and we know they've lied about the numbers from car wrecks and motorcycle wrecks and people with heart attacks and cancer and the flu and pneumonia.
[02:54:41.661 --> 02:54:44.081]  All of that, they admit, has been put in the column, but it doesn't matter.
[02:54:44.401 --> 02:54:46.082]  Don't question the science or you'll be censored.
[02:54:46.302 --> 02:54:46.982]  You'll be fired.
[02:54:47.722 --> 02:54:58.210]  And so the very people that cooked this up at Wuhan and launched it and lied to us about the death numbers, saying 4% would die, it wasn't even 1-10th of 1%, we're still supposed to listen to them.
[02:54:58.490 --> 02:55:01.192]  So here's the headline, experts say COVID could become endemic.
[02:55:02.033 --> 02:55:07.677]  What that means for you, and it goes on to say, oh, there'll be new versions, COVID-19, COVID-20, 2021, 2022.
[02:55:09.099 --> 02:55:11.861]  In fact, even major Hollywood producers
[02:55:13.581 --> 02:55:21.604]  Have movies coming out, like Songbird, about how the lockdown's never going to end, never going to stop, and soon there'll be camps and checkpoints.
[02:55:22.024 --> 02:55:23.025]  But that's just a movie, right?
[02:55:23.065 --> 02:55:32.549]  No, they have the contact tracers in Australia, in the UK, and now in Canada, arresting people that try to walk down the street, beating up women, beating up men, strip-searching them.
[02:55:33.069 --> 02:55:35.110]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:43.293]  This is the excuse to take over the producers and break the will of the people that voted for Brexit, or voted for Trump, or voted for Bolsonaro.
[02:55:44.397 --> 02:55:48.158]  This is a authoritarian takeover and it's so incredibly criminal.
[02:55:48.358 --> 02:55:49.698]  Here's Bill Gates, CNBC.
[02:55:50.018 --> 02:55:51.118]  Bill Gates on mask.
[02:55:51.678 --> 02:55:55.679]  He goes on to say, if you're vaccinated, you can still transmit.
[02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:56.879]  Really?
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:57.540]  Wow.
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:00.740]  So now you can't go out.
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:03.601]  I'm not going to stop wearing mask.
[02:56:04.821 --> 02:56:08.182]  See, because they're never going to let go this power grab.
[02:56:08.662 --> 02:56:09.342]  It's a problem.
[02:56:10.265 --> 02:56:10.405]  That's
[02:56:32.614 --> 02:56:35.495]  All I can tell you is they're coming for our children now.
[02:56:35.615 --> 02:56:45.700]  I've got the articles right here saying now they're going to come and basically give it to school children, the COVID-19 vaccine, when it's an experimental vaccine and they admit COVID doesn't even affect children and the vaccine's dangerous.
[02:56:46.121 --> 02:56:47.321]  This is so incredibly evil.
[02:56:47.701 --> 02:56:53.904]  So help us at InfoWars stay on air for however long God wants to keep us on air and God's going to work through you to decide how long it's going to be.
[02:56:53.944 --> 02:56:55.445]  But I would get your supplements.
[02:56:55.845 --> 02:56:57.066]  I would get you preparing asylums.
[02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:58.046]  I'd get your storable food.
[02:56:58.146 --> 02:57:01.308]  I would get all those things at InfoWarsStore.com while you still can.
[02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:06.013]  And running through March 6th, we have 10% off of storable food and free shipping.
[02:57:06.033 --> 02:57:06.774]  That's a huge deal.
[02:57:06.794 --> 02:57:07.274]  Never do that.
[02:57:07.654 --> 02:57:11.898]  And up to 50% off of supplements and all the rest of the products at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:57:11.918 --> 02:57:14.540]  So store-wide free shipping at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:17.782]  And a lot more, and it's going to have to end coming up this Saturday.
[02:57:18.122 --> 02:57:19.503]  So please check it out while you still can.
[02:57:19.523 --> 02:57:21.685]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast.
