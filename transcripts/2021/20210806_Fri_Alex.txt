[00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:24.103]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:29.026]  It's Friday, August 6th.
[00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:29.686]  The year is 2021.
[00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.713]  And across the planet, permanent martial law is being established.
[00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:42.435]  The chains are going on.
[00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:51.839]  Lockdown 2 is being incrementally activated in the United States, and in many areas of the world, was never removed.
[00:00:54.215 --> 00:01:02.820]  And I've said this many times, each new broadcast we engage in is going to be more important and more extreme than the last because those are the times we live in.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.347]  But this information now in front of us is 100% documented, completely clear and is very paradoxical.
[00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:20.531]  Very paradoxical because it is actually the National Health Services that are reporting the data
[00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.674]  And then it's completely being ignored by the media, and they continue to move forward with it.
[00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:28.775]  And what am I talking about?
[00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.478]  It's just dumb founding.
[00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:36.141]  It'd be like if they were on national TV saying, 2 plus 2 equals 7.
[00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:37.322]  And then tomorrow it equals 10.
[00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:38.343]  The next day it equals 1.
[00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:39.184]  You're like, no, it equals 4.
[00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.867]  Now we knew this months ago.
[00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:45.169]  And we got data here, data there.
[00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.170]  But now it's confirmed.
[00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.372]  Remember Israel three weeks ago said,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.661]  We're getting new breakthrough cases in people that are vaccinated.
[00:01:52.661 --> 00:02:00.266]  Then they said, yeah, the majority of people that are really sick have had the inoculation.
[00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:05.809]  And then other countries reported the same thing all over the world, same numbers.
[00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:09.070]  First 75% of our new cases are vaccinated.
[00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.491]  Then it's 85, then 90.
[00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:10.971]  It's now 100% in major countries.
[00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.212]  I've got it right here.
[00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.903]  Hospitalized and dying.
[00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:21.606]  Now remember what Fauci said three weeks ago.
[00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:27.593]  100% or 99% of the people sick or dying didn't have the shot.
[00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:29.415]  And you just heard that lie.
[00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.517]  And Congress said, where's the numbers on that?
[00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:35.562]  You don't get them!
[00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.925]  Put your mask back on, take your shot!
[00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:41.746]  It's like, Chucky, I got my shot!
[00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:45.107]  I got my shot for you!
[00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:47.108]  FDA approved!
[00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:48.928]  Kevin Saki says, like, no it's not!
[00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:50.629]  Yeah it is!
[00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.889]  Dang it!
[00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:54.729]  And look at these headlines.
[00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:59.531]  This is out of National Australian News, WSAU.
[00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.311]  Sydney, Australia.
[00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:08.253]  All new COVID hospitalizations involve vaccinated individuals.
[00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:09.313]  Except one.
[00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.351]  And that came out weeks ago.
[00:03:12.351 --> 00:03:13.151]  New numbers are out.
[00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.472]  It's now 100%.
[00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:16.713]  They've had 10 deaths in the last eight months.
[00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:18.234]  They still keep the country locked down.
[00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:25.518]  Now, here's the new one out of Israel that I'm going to play right now.
[00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:25.938]  It's clip 13.
[00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.299]  This is their national news.
[00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:36.284]  Dr. Kobi Havi announcing that they are opening more COVID wards, not COVID wards, for the inoculated.
[00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.140]  And he says 95% of the severe patients are vaccinated.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.481]  And they spin that to go, oh, it's the Delta variant.
[00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:46.702]  Oh, yeah.
[00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:51.583]  Yeah, that Delta variant sure seems to target people who took the shot.
[00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:52.823]  Uh-huh.
[00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:53.103]  Sure.
[00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:55.644]  Pull that out of your rear end.
[00:03:55.644 --> 00:04:00.505]  Oh, yeah, the Delta variant only gets you if you takes the shot.
[00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:02.726]  It's called spike protein.
[00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.693]  Oh, you're very sick now.
[00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:10.176]  Let me go back to my laboratory where we torture dogs to death.
[00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:11.977]  Or babies.
[00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:15.200]  Oh, came out yesterday, we keep babies alive.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.725]  Fauci does, while we get the organs.
[00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:22.746]  Ugh, I'm Fauci.
[00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:24.928]  We're gonna come back and play all that for you.
[00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:28.711]  But I mean, it's just all a freak show.
[00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:30.733]  Oh, it's the Delta variant.
[00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:32.495]  We got another shot for you.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:45.189]  And then they admit in the literature, a year and a half ago, Gates was like, oh, there'll be need for more shots, and there'll be a special booster.
[00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.793]  Because if they can get away with killing you en masse with the shots, well, they've got even more for yous.
[00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:56.318]  That more for yous is, uh, I love my laboratories where we torture beagles to death, though.
[00:05:00.578 --> 00:05:06.644]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:14.152]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:16.474]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:20.038]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.125]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:36.029]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:46.756]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.017]  Thank you and God bless.

[00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:16.566]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:18.247]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.247 --> 00:06:19.927]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:25.429]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:35.594]  Well, all over the world, in the most vaccinated countries, in fact, if you look at all the big travel advisories of where the U.S.
[00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:38.795]  citizens shouldn't go for the highest, quote, COVID levels and illnesses,
[00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:44.606]  Why, it's the people that have had the injections.
[00:06:44.606 --> 00:06:49.189]  All COVID cases with hospitalization in Australia have had the inoculation.
[00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.490]  All.
[00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.372]  Except one.
[00:06:53.372 --> 00:07:02.859]  Israel is reporting officially 95% of those in the hospital with serious cases have had the shot.
[00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:07.022]  Gee, this snake bit me and I got sick.
[00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:09.344]  The snake must have poison in its fangs.
[00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:20.240]  If I walked over to you and hit you in the head with a baseball bat, and you got a subdermal hematoma and a concussion, you wouldn't go, gee, wonder what gave me that.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.503]  When the police got there, you'd say, he hit me in the head with a baseball bat, I'm dying, I need brain surgery.
[00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:33.827]  But we sit here and go, oh, oh, it's the Delta variant, oh, yes!
[00:07:34.873 --> 00:07:38.675]  So then the Delta variant only attacks those that are inoculated, right?
[00:07:38.675 --> 00:07:41.816]  No, it's the vaccine doing it.
[00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:44.998]  That's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:50.160]  A lobotomized three-year-old can understand that.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.221]  But we as a culture
[00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:56.441]  Including even Rand Paul, supposedly hardcore against these guys, or DeSantis.
[00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:57.041]  Where are they?
[00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.962]  They still just go along with the vaccine.
[00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:03.184]  So they vaccinate Florida, they got a bunch of sick people now, almost all vaccinated.
[00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:06.145]  And I saw DeSantis last night going, the numbers are clear!
[00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:08.146]  It's the unvaccinated that are getting sick.
[00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:10.427]  Bull crap!
[00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:17.570]  Yes, there are some people getting sick from the vaccinated, because it's shedding, and Pfizer and Moderna admit it sheds.
[00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.051]  That's all admitted in their own studies.
[00:08:20.738 --> 00:08:30.008]  But the really, really, really, really sick people, 95% of them Israel say, of the serious hospitalizations, which again, 95%.
[00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:35.794]  Oh, what's the numbers I talked about last week out of Gibraltar, out of Singapore, out of Iceland?
[00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:38.016]  75 to 98% inoculation rates.
[00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:47.524]  And 75 to 90 plus percent of the hospitalized people took the damn shot.
[00:08:47.524 --> 00:08:50.247]  Country after country after country.
[00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:54.290]  You know, again, we got John the boom operator over here.
[00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.371]  He does a great job, the camera guy.
[00:08:56.437 --> 00:09:09.903]  I would not do this, but, you know, it's an analogy, but again, if we got John out here in the middle of the floor and poured gasoline over him like a Buddhist monk protesting the Vietnam War, and he lit himself on fire, he's going to really get hurt bad, probably die.
[00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:12.024]  We're going to wish he was dead.
[00:09:12.024 --> 00:09:13.885]  Now, did the gasoline light him on fire?
[00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:18.687]  In fact, can we show the famous Buddhist monk sets himself on fire in Vietnam?
[00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:21.048]  Famous photo, Buddhist monk, Vietnam will pull it up.
[00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:28.227]  Yes, he took about a pint of gasoline, put it on himself, lit himself on fire, and he died.
[00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:30.488]  Meditated for about three minutes while he burned to death.
[00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:36.570]  Now, did the gasoline kill the Buddhist monk, or did the Easter Bunny?
[00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:43.272]  Because they're telling you this, imagine this Delta variant is putting almost everybody in the hospital.
[00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:48.977]  95%, that's an even higher percentage, in Australia.
[00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:55.226]  There's one person in the hospital in Australia that didn't have the injection.
[00:09:55.226 --> 00:10:00.013]  Now, did the gasoline kill the monk?
[00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:03.691]  Put the photo back up there, because I've seen the pre-photos.
[00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.254]  They get a smaller little picture of it out of the bigger container.
[00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.716]  Was it the gasoline out of that white pitcher?
[00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:09.777]  Out of that white container?
[00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:12.419]  Or was it, again, Santa Claus did that?
[00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:12.840]  What was it?
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.162]  Casper the Friendly Ghost lit that guy on fire?
[00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:18.185]  Because look, there it is, the Delta variant lit that guy on fire.
[00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:19.706]  Did you know that?
[00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.047]  Yeah, that's not gasoline.
[00:10:21.047 --> 00:10:22.729]  It's not what we know he took.
[00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:33.709]  So again, 95% of the big surge in the hospital beds are actually full in Israel now.
[00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:36.010]  They don't have to make it up this time.
[00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.251]  And then they're going to gaslight us?
[00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:43.391]  Talk about gaslighting.
[00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:55.874]  So here's one of the government spokespersons, Dr. Kobi Havi, on 95% of the severe patients are vaccinated.
[00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.071]  Here it is.
[00:10:58.071 --> 00:10:59.552]  Hello, Dr. Kobi Haviv.
[00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:03.775]  He's the Director of the Herzog Medical Center.
[00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:04.256]  Hello, Sivan.
[00:11:04.256 --> 00:11:09.319]  And just a reminder, I understand that many of the patients are vaccinated, even the difficult patients.
[00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:21.228]  Yes, listen, naturally, most of the elderly people are vaccinated, most of them are vaccinated, and therefore about 90%, 85-90% of the patients in our center are fully vaccinated.
[00:11:22.738 --> 00:11:23.859]  So their answer is...
[00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:48.741]  Because you know, they're the doctors, they couldn't be doing anything wrong with the National Health Service, with their freedom bracelets and the rest of it, GPS tracking everybody.
[00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.502]  No, it must be the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:11:51.502 --> 00:12:00.326]  Yeah, that's why all over the world, in the old and the young, in the middle age, that almost everyone in the hospital took the shot.
[00:12:00.326 --> 00:12:04.808]  That's either one of two things, the injections doing it, or it makes you super
[00:12:08.106 --> 00:12:17.853]  Susceptible to other viruses, which the literature also shows it can do, and make you have a horrible autoimmune response to any coronavirus, which are the most common you ever come in contact with.
[00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:20.856]  There's 30 plus horrible things these things can do.
[00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:22.797]  But what did it say in all the literature?
[00:12:22.797 --> 00:12:28.821]  What did the head scientist, the former chief scientist, the Nobel Prize winners, what did they all say about this?
[00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:35.827]  Last year, when they looked at the vaccine, most of the vaccine was secret, but they said, it's going to block this spike protein by producing it in the body.
[00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:37.308]  And then that'll make your body then attack that.
[00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:46.595]  And they said, well, that's going to cause people to get blood clots and die and have autoimmune responses and have seizures and Guillain-Barre.
[00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:47.856]  And now they admit all that.
[00:12:47.856 --> 00:12:54.079]  And so, wow, I was driving into work today and I saw a school bus, I guess, getting ready for school to start.
[00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:57.081]  It had like images of turtles and frogs on the side.
[00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:59.122]  I guess it was like a private school.
[00:12:59.122 --> 00:13:05.045]  And it made me feel physically angry that now they're moving against our children 12 and under with these deadly injections.
[00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:13.576]  So, here we are, my friends, in the year 2021.
[00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:21.200]  It's like, again, watching somebody on a train track when a train's coming at 60 miles an hour, and you know the train can't stop in that limited amount of time.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.582]  If you jump out in front of a train going 60 miles an hour, and that train's even 100 yards away, it can't stop.
[00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:31.542]  And we've all seen, I guess, the footage online of people committing suicide jumping in front of trains, at least I have.
[00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:33.924]  And you can watch people jump in front of trains.
[00:13:33.924 --> 00:13:38.849]  And so they jump in front of the train, there's about 10 seconds, they try to slam the brakes on, and they still hit them going 50 miles an hour.
[00:13:38.849 --> 00:13:41.651]  60 miles an hour.
[00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:43.253]  And that was last year.
[00:13:43.253 --> 00:13:50.960]  Except Fauci and Bill Gates put us on the tracks, we knew what the shots would do, all the top scientists told us,
[00:13:52.278 --> 00:14:12.788]  We told you it won't protect you, it'll lower your immunity, it'll cause autoimmune problems, it'll make your body attack itself, it'll cause Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, epilepsy, brain fog, prion disease, which will cause heart attacks, lung collapse, destruction of the brain, Alzheimer's, and now it's all confirmed, and it's just like a footnote.
[00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:15.930]  Okay, yeah, yeah, there's all that, but it's not the vaccine.
[00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.251]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:21.853]  It's a Delta variant, and then they say, but it might have come from the vaccine.
[00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:28.739]  The point is they had the literature and they did this because they know it causes a shotgun effect.
[00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:36.967]  But they also figured out about eight months ago, when they had really high death numbers in England, there was a little too much for even the military to carry this out.
[00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:41.809]  The military came out and said, don't take this if you're over 75, under 16, or pregnant.
[00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:43.730]  Even they put that alert out.
[00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.211]  But then the media hit it.
[00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.692]  Oh, Google and Facebook and Twitter, don't listen to the military's own warning.
[00:14:48.692 --> 00:14:52.694]  So then suddenly, saline started getting passed out everywhere.
[00:14:52.694 --> 00:14:56.136]  And that was the scientists and doctors and military going, screw this.
[00:14:56.136 --> 00:14:58.256]  And say, let's agree to destroy this.
[00:14:58.256 --> 00:14:59.037]  Let's give them saline.
[00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:02.172]  That's why all over the world it's failing.
[00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:06.619]  It's not like some people thought, oh, the government didn't want too high of death numbers.
[00:15:06.619 --> 00:15:07.380]  That was the argument.
[00:15:08.257 --> 00:15:08.837]  We're good to go.
[00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:44.944]  They see basically their patients dying so they do the right thing because they're humans.
[00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.346]  Okay, it's simple.
[00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:48.188]  The vaccine's to kill us.
[00:15:48.188 --> 00:15:49.869]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill us.
[00:15:49.869 --> 00:15:51.651]  He's been kicked out of 30 plus countries.
[00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.033]  He's doing it to us now.
[00:15:53.033 --> 00:15:55.055]  His vaccine's banned in China and India.
[00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.197]  Arrest him and Fauci now!
[00:15:57.197 --> 00:15:58.479]  I want them arrested now!
[00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:07.605]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:08.625]  Here's why.
[00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:12.547]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:12.547 --> 00:16:17.669]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:26.073]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:34.638]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:41.435]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:45.277]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:16:45.277 --> 00:16:47.278]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:55.681]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.042]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:58.632 --> 00:17:05.079]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.521]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:08.362]  Here's the thing.
[00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:12.687]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:13.628]  Survival soup beans.
[00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:22.212]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[00:17:22.212 --> 00:17:23.293]  The best part?
[00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:32.337]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:33.617]  It gets even better.
[00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:44.382]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[00:17:44.382 --> 00:17:45.202]  Period.
[00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:47.223]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:49.383]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:55.346]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:55.346 --> 00:17:56.626]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:18:04.318 --> 00:18:05.518]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:06.319]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.399]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:07.959]  Go ahead.
[00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:08.499]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:11.120]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.160]  I am a granny.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:21.823]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:27.825]  But since taking Eurex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:18:27.825 --> 00:18:28.825]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:38.830]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:47.574]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:18:47.574 --> 00:18:48.394]  This is working.
[00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:49.395]  This is wonderful.
[00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:53.937]  You know, I don't I don't have to put it on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[00:18:53.937 --> 00:18:58.599]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:04.970]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:05.350]  Welcome.
[00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.790]  Go ahead.
[00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.671]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[00:19:07.671 --> 00:19:08.752]  Great last caller.
[00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:11.813]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:19:11.813 --> 00:19:17.516]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:19.277]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:21.298]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:22.178]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:19:22.178 --> 00:19:22.618]  Go ahead.
[00:19:22.618 --> 00:19:23.038]  Hey, Alex.
[00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.158]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:19:24.158 --> 00:19:27.179]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:28.860]  The X Team does wonders.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.020]  I recommend it to everybody.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.981]  If you're on the fence about it, get off the fence.
[00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:32.861]  Get the product.
[00:19:32.861 --> 00:19:34.081]  Support the InfoWars.
[00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:35.342]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.002]  You're on the air.
[00:19:36.002 --> 00:19:36.562]  Thanks for holding.
[00:19:36.562 --> 00:19:36.922]  Go ahead.
[00:19:36.922 --> 00:19:37.562]  Hey, Alex.
[00:19:37.562 --> 00:19:38.703]  It's great to be on with you.
[00:19:38.703 --> 00:19:39.203]  It's an honor.
[00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:41.124]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:41.604]  Awesome.
[00:19:41.604 --> 00:19:46.766]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:19:46.766 --> 00:19:50.867]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:52.628]  So, just number one for a few reasons.
[00:19:52.628 --> 00:19:53.528]  Well, it definitely works.
[00:19:53.528 --> 00:19:55.149]  It's not a joke.
[00:19:55.149 --> 00:20:03.172]  Absolutely.
[00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:05.813]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:34.905]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want this to be true.
[00:20:34.905 --> 00:20:37.365]  But it is true.
[00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:38.626]  And I'm completely freaked out.
[00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:39.366]  I'm so sad.
[00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:45.207]  And a lot of people we know and a lot of people we care about are already dead and are already dying.
[00:20:45.207 --> 00:20:52.488]  Last year, it was all people that were dying of other illnesses, cancer, heart attacks.
[00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:55.589]  They were counting on this COVID to create the fear to get the vaccine in people.
[00:20:56.499 --> 00:21:08.586]  Then, literally, 90 plus percent of all the top scientists, which is just an ocean of them, said, this won't protect you, it'll kill people, it'll cause heart attacks, strokes, autoimmune disease.
[00:21:08.586 --> 00:21:10.407]  I just keep repeating the same thing, that's what they all said.
[00:21:10.407 --> 00:21:13.868]  That's what's in the studies, they knew, they said, what are you doing?
[00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:14.549]  This is crazy!
[00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:18.007]  And now they've gone ahead with it.
[00:21:18.007 --> 00:21:23.272]  And I said last year, they're going to claim it's a variant because the unvaccinated didn't vaccinate.
[00:21:23.272 --> 00:21:24.733]  Because I just know how they operate.
[00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:26.234]  I know how these criminals are.
[00:21:26.234 --> 00:21:28.015]  So I was thinking, how will they get away with this?
[00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:32.779]  Well, they'll say all the dying people are because of the unvaccinated.
[00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:35.682]  And then I said, but it'll be the vaccinated that are dying.
[00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:38.424]  But it doesn't matter because they've murdered logic.
[00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:44.368]  Are we not exactly where I said we'd be 16, 17 months ago, 10 months ago, five months ago?
[00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:44.709]  We're here.
[00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:48.370]  And I don't just go off the news.
[00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.471]  I've got all my contacts and sources.
[00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:56.393]  The hospitals across the world are full of vaccinated people dead and dying.
[00:21:56.393 --> 00:22:03.176]  And they're just gauging right now how they're going to announce this to the public.
[00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:06.038]  Biden is going to announce his emergency probably next week.
[00:22:06.038 --> 00:22:07.118]  I know that they're preparing it.
[00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.319]  They've got the speech written.
[00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:08.959]  That's confirmed.
[00:22:08.959 --> 00:22:10.620]  He may not pull the trigger on August 11th.
[00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:21.330]  But then there's other dates that we're seeing into early next year for the national emergency he's planning to announce.
[00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.093]  That's why I keep saying January.
[00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:23.995]  I'm talking about August, but...
[00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:29.479]  The next move is the internet kill switch and is the FEMA takeover of communications.
[00:22:29.479 --> 00:22:35.244]  And that's why Apple announced, OK, we're scanning and reading everything you say and do in live time.
[00:22:35.244 --> 00:22:37.346]  Notice Apple has all these billboards and TV ads.
[00:22:37.346 --> 00:22:38.907]  We're the privacy company.
[00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:40.889]  You have total privacy with us.
[00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:45.413]  Four years ago, they gave all the code keys to everybody with Apple devices in the world to the Communist Chinese.
[00:22:45.413 --> 00:22:46.494]  Tim Cook moved to China.
[00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:49.257]  He said he supports GGP and supports dictatorship.
[00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:55.278]  You've seen all these other leaders pledge themselves to Xi Jinping and say they want to be dictators.
[00:22:55.278 --> 00:23:03.944]  You've seen Bill Gates' lawyer, Berkshire Hathaway co-owner say he pledges himself to Xi Jinping.
[00:23:03.944 --> 00:23:08.587]  You've seen Trudeau pledge himself to Xi Jinping.
[00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:13.830]  Apple has revealed plans to spy on everyone's iPhone.
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.492]  But oh, it's to stop child porn.
[00:23:17.273 --> 00:23:18.393]  Sure it is.
[00:23:18.393 --> 00:23:20.254]  Oh, we're going to read everything you do for your safety.
[00:23:20.254 --> 00:23:24.415]  But, but, oh, we're the privacy company.
[00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:25.555]  And you're like, but that's the opposite.
[00:23:25.555 --> 00:23:28.276]  Well, exactly.
[00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:36.898]  And when we come back, I've still got a lot of time in this segment, when we come back, I'm going to talk about what was trending number one on many of the charts on Twitter.
[00:23:36.898 --> 00:23:39.799]  And in the top 10 total, Alex Jones was right.
[00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:44.400]  And Alex Jones were trending yesterday and today, again, as at the top.
[00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:45.419]  I don't
[00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:03.499]  And
[00:24:24.304 --> 00:24:26.065]  Get all the buyers ready, get it prepared.
[00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:28.587]  Sometimes it takes a day, sometimes it takes a week.
[00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:38.955]  I've been told they don't like to keep them around the ward more than a week or so, because even the special nurses they've hired to work in these very secretive wards get a little freaked out.
[00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:43.658]  And we always use this graphic from five years ago, but it's way higher than that.
[00:24:43.658 --> 00:24:48.342]  They get the $300,000 or more from what's in a baby, a seven pound baby.
[00:24:49.528 --> 00:24:53.729]  So, now the heart's like a hundred grand, so that's an inaccurate graph.
[00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:56.209]  Not mad the group put it up there, just wanted to let you know that.
[00:24:56.209 --> 00:25:18.814]  And you ask, well, why would Governor Northam, who used to run Harvesting of Babies, when he was not in a KKK outfit, why would Governor Northam four years ago go on a show and say, well, we don't involve the authorities, we don't involve the police and the courts, it's between the mother and the doctor and she can make a decision, seven-month-old, whether we gonna resuscitate or whether we gonna, you know, get rid of it.
[00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:25.378]  And if she makes the decision not to resuscitate, we take the baby and we keep it comfortable.
[00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:30.199]  Well, I don't need to know and to defer from what he said what that means.
[00:25:30.199 --> 00:25:31.099]  I do know.
[00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:35.281]  And I've talked to the nurses, and I've confirmed it.
[00:25:35.281 --> 00:25:44.864]  When they say you've died and are brain dead in a car accident, and your family's told your dad, and you make the decision to not, quote, keep you alive, they then shuffle you out.
[00:25:44.864 --> 00:25:45.564]  You're still alive.
[00:25:46.949 --> 00:25:49.612]  And they keep you a lot of times for a week.
[00:25:49.612 --> 00:25:52.775]  They put an oxygen tent over you, even though you don't need it.
[00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:54.397]  It's like a symbol of this person's dead.
[00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:56.859]  This has been going on for 50 years.
[00:25:56.859 --> 00:26:00.503]  And then when they get all the stuff lined up, then they do the surgery and get all the stuff.
[00:26:00.503 --> 00:26:02.786]  Well, then they try to go on 20 years ago.
[00:26:02.786 --> 00:26:04.828]  Well, why are we going to waste the seven pounds of meat?
[00:26:07.867 --> 00:26:12.893]  And so, they then convince poor women, oh, your baby's deformed, or your baby's got a sickness.
[00:26:12.893 --> 00:26:16.117]  Oh, you know, oh, you're in labor, you're a homeless woman.
[00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:17.719]  We just, the baby didn't make it.
[00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:19.921]  Sign the form, sweetheart.
[00:26:19.921 --> 00:26:22.424]  She signs the form, she's all drugged up.
[00:26:22.424 --> 00:26:25.228]  And they get that baby.
[00:26:25.228 --> 00:26:26.149]  And I mean, why not?
[00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:27.791]  It's all a commodity, we're all commodities now.
[00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:33.138]  You know, it's come out, nobody cared that Fauci got a lot of these babies that were still alive.
[00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:39.562]  They would actually deliver them, living, that's in the documents, to the universities, and it turns out Fauci was over most of those courts, I guess.
[00:26:39.562 --> 00:26:40.823]  Everybody's really mad about beagles.
[00:26:42.162 --> 00:26:50.326]  And it's just one thing they did to beagles, hundreds of thousands of dollars per program, 300,000 here, 500,000 there, it's all coming out.
[00:26:50.326 --> 00:27:05.494]  They would take beagles, puppies of course, they like to really hurt young things, and they would implant in them African and Latin American boring maggot flies and all sorts of other diseases, and then watch them eaten by the maggots.
[00:27:05.494 --> 00:27:07.895]  And you ask, why would they do that in other burrowing flies?
[00:27:07.895 --> 00:27:08.476]  And they said, well,
[00:27:09.076 --> 00:27:12.359]  They also have flies that burrow into the brain.
[00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:17.342]  Because Fauci in the program was trying to figure out how to give those to humans.
[00:27:17.342 --> 00:27:18.503]  That's admitted.
[00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:30.793]  The grants are for how to transmit things previously not transmitted to humans so that he can learn, God knows why, how to implant these things in your body.
[00:27:30.793 --> 00:27:32.134]  So, just thought you might want to know.
[00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:34.315]  But he's a great man, right?
[00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:37.157]  Running the Wuhan lab and data function and all the rest of it.
[00:27:37.918 --> 00:27:43.100]  And of course, he also used scalps from boarded babies to create human mice.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.801]  And they would put the hair on the mice.
[00:27:45.801 --> 00:27:47.282]  That's just part of it.
[00:27:47.282 --> 00:27:54.165]  They would also keep the babies alive and put mice brains inside their brains and connect their brains together.
[00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:58.147]  And oh, here's a little secret, a little extra for you.
[00:27:58.147 --> 00:28:00.428]  If they make the baby 1% bovine or porcine or pinniped,
[00:28:05.334 --> 00:28:06.916]  They do all that.
[00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:12.280]  That's porcines, pigs, pinnipeds.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.341]  You know what those are?
[00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:15.303]  That's seals.
[00:28:15.303 --> 00:28:17.164]  Bovines, cow.
[00:28:17.164 --> 00:28:20.547]  When they make you just a small percentage of an animal, you no longer have rights.
[00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:24.270]  That's why they're huge in the cloning chimera.
[00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:29.074]  Remember two months ago, Congress tried to pass a law saying stop all the cloning farms?
[00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:31.436]  And they said, oh, it fell by nine votes.
[00:28:31.436 --> 00:28:32.057]  Remember?
[00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:33.018]  Nine votes in the U.S.
[00:28:33.018 --> 00:28:33.278]  Senate.
[00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:39.483]  Yeah, Republicans voted with Democrats to keep the animal-human clones going, so they don't have any rights.
[00:28:39.483 --> 00:28:45.866]  And by the way, I mean, I've talked to three-star generals who were in the bases with the human-animal clones.
[00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:48.528]  General Stubblebine saw that kind of stuff.
[00:28:48.528 --> 00:28:51.629]  He was the head of all special forces, head of all the secret programs.
[00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:55.051]  He wasn't in those programs, but I know he saw some of that.
[00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:55.891]  He's dead now.
[00:28:55.891 --> 00:28:56.792]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.792 --> 00:28:57.152]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.042 --> 00:28:59.843]  Hey, everybody.
[00:28:59.843 --> 00:29:03.085]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:03.846]  Me too.
[00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:10.951]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:15.354]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:17.256]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:18.257]  I certainly do.
[00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:19.197]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:19.197 --> 00:29:27.524]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:33.508]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:33.508 --> 00:29:34.869]  No cures or treatments there.
[00:29:34.869 --> 00:29:44.075]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research, and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:44.995]  And the best part?
[00:29:44.995 --> 00:29:51.720]  You can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.560]  Crazy, right?
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.543]  Learn more about this unusual limited-time offer at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:56.543 --> 00:29:57.724]  That's StrongerDefense.com.
[00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:11.313]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:30:11.313 --> 00:30:19.279]  Even more than the general public, they do the same things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:21.261]  Well, guess what?
[00:30:21.261 --> 00:30:35.248]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist, that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[00:30:36.448 --> 00:30:41.953]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:30:41.953 --> 00:30:48.319]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:57.627]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:30:57.627 --> 00:30:58.728]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:00.472 --> 00:31:06.054]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:31:06.054 --> 00:31:14.056]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:31:14.056 --> 00:31:16.356]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:31:16.356 --> 00:31:19.938]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:30.043]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:03.981]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[00:32:03.981 --> 00:32:08.542]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:17.746]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:32:17.746 --> 00:32:21.868]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:39.741]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:16.773]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.773 --> 00:33:19.638]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:31.136]  In a recent video, Polly St.
[00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:46.584]  George talks us through her recent investigation of the company Entrust, a company who just recently signed a contract with the United Kingdom to provide digital passports for COVID-19 vaccine tracking.
[00:33:46.584 --> 00:33:56.109]  What she discovered was that the family who owns Entrust not only has Nazi roots, but they are in fact a very prominent Nazi family.
[00:33:56.109 --> 00:33:58.331]  The family in question is the Quantz family.
[00:34:00.132 --> 00:34:05.615]  In 1929, Gunther Quandt took over one of the largest arms manufacturers in Germany.
[00:34:05.615 --> 00:34:11.998]  He then divorced his second wife Magda, who then married Joseph Goebbels, just two years later in 1931.
[00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:18.697]  The Goebbels family then became heavily involved in the Quant family business.
[00:34:18.697 --> 00:34:24.599]  Maybe this was one of those instances of marriage to cement a business relationship.
[00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.940]  Sort of like royalty does.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.921]  But this is the new royalty.
[00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:31.462]  This is the industrialist royalty.
[00:34:31.462 --> 00:34:35.564]  This is the globalist regime being born.
[00:34:36.733 --> 00:34:37.534]  That's just a guess.
[00:34:37.534 --> 00:34:39.615]  Here's some photos from the wedding.
[00:34:39.615 --> 00:34:47.600]  Their marriage took place on a grand property owned by Gunther Quandt, where Adolf Hitler served as the best man.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:56.346]  In 1933, Gunther officially joined the Nazi party and was granted special privileges to use slave labor.
[00:34:56.346 --> 00:35:05.052]  Gunther and his sons, Herbert and Harold, staffed their factories with over 50,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp workers.
[00:35:06.318 --> 00:35:12.002]  One of their factories even had its own concentration camp, an execution area.
[00:35:12.002 --> 00:35:15.265]  The end of World War II had little effect on the Quant family.
[00:35:16.095 --> 00:35:26.122]  A former prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials claims that there was plenty of evidence to prosecute the quants, and regrets how they were allowed to evade punishment.
[00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:37.091]  Not only did the quants evade punishment at Nuremberg, Herbert went on as a director of Deutsche Bank, became an honorary citizen, and a czar of the whole German economy.
[00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.112]  He married Johanna Bruhn in 1960.
[00:35:40.112 --> 00:35:52.399]  They had two children, Stefan Quandt and Suzanne Klatten, Germany's richest woman, who recently told reporters how difficult it is being a billionaire.
[00:35:52.399 --> 00:36:03.185]  Entrust was bought by the Quandt family in 1987, has went on to gain contracts in banking and government, including just about every level of the U.S.
[00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:03.906]  federal government.
[00:36:04.446 --> 00:36:08.741]  And has just signed a contract to provide digital passports for the UK.
[00:36:10.279 --> 00:36:16.585]  The Quant family weren't the only Nazi industrialists to go on after the war and thrive.
[00:36:16.585 --> 00:36:20.348]  IG Farben-Baer is the father of Big Pharma.
[00:36:20.348 --> 00:36:23.691]  And this ideology wasn't born with the Nazis.
[00:36:23.691 --> 00:36:29.817]  It comes from the Sabbatean Frankist Rockefeller Rothschild banking empire.
[00:36:29.817 --> 00:36:36.142]  The ones who mysteriously create money and loan it to us with interest as if they own it all.
[00:36:36.923 --> 00:36:38.424]  We know who they are.
[00:36:38.424 --> 00:36:42.387]  Many of them are coming out of the shadows and offering us tyranny.
[00:36:42.387 --> 00:36:45.210]  And many of us are accepting the offer.
[00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:53.596]  And all we have to do to save our lives is say no to this criminal gang of psychotic vampires.
[00:36:53.596 --> 00:37:00.062]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:37:00.062 --> 00:37:04.485]  All right, that report digital passport company run by Nazis.
[00:37:04.485 --> 00:37:05.326]  Nazi royalty?
[00:37:13.476 --> 00:37:28.862]  You know, when I used to be a little kid, I would see movies like Friday the 13th, and I would wonder why in the movies, when Jason's chasing him with a butcher knife through the forest, why they run and fall down and like back away on their butts.
[00:37:28.862 --> 00:37:30.283]  Oh, please don't kill me, please!
[00:37:30.283 --> 00:37:33.084]  Because I would just keep running like a million miles an hour or I'd fight back.
[00:37:34.957 --> 00:37:48.871]  But then I grew up and learned how the world really worked, and I actually learned that a lot of people, actually, if somebody pulled a knife on them, would just start falling down to the ground and begging and pleading, and wouldn't even run.
[00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:52.814]  I've experienced that particularly in women.
[00:37:52.814 --> 00:37:58.200]  And that's why the globalists target women, with all their propaganda and their attacks.
[00:38:00.097 --> 00:38:02.039]  I never thought people were really like that.
[00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:03.840]  My instincts were like, this isn't real.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.943]  No one would just beg and plead while the killer comes over with a knife.
[00:38:07.943 --> 00:38:12.446]  Somebody walks in here with a knife, I'm going to pick this marble table over and smash him over the head.
[00:38:12.446 --> 00:38:13.507]  I'm going to kill him.
[00:38:13.507 --> 00:38:15.849]  I'm going to die trying.
[00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:17.350]  I'm not Mr. Tough Guy.
[00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.972]  It's like flipping a damn switch.
[00:38:19.972 --> 00:38:21.473]  But now you see it.
[00:38:21.473 --> 00:38:24.736]  These people are killing us en masse.
[00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:27.718]  And we're not just groveling on the ground saying, please don't hurt me.
[00:38:27.718 --> 00:38:28.719]  Please don't stab me.
[00:38:31.246 --> 00:38:34.828]  Instead, people are like, oh, I want more shots.
[00:38:34.828 --> 00:38:37.690]  It's like, but almost everyone dying is taking the shot.
[00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.550]  I want more shots.
[00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.371]  I want more shots.
[00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.032]  I want more shots.
[00:38:42.032 --> 00:38:47.135]  And you can't even admit to themselves that they're being attacked and they're being targeted.
[00:38:47.135 --> 00:38:51.738]  Instead, they turn around and go, it's you that didn't take the shot.
[00:38:51.738 --> 00:38:56.760]  You're the reason this is happening, and now you've got to do it.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.122]  I started saying this a month ago, and it's now borne out.
[00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:04.414]  The hospitals were totally empty last year, that was a total fraud.
[00:39:04.414 --> 00:39:06.536]  Hospitals are full of people.
[00:39:06.536 --> 00:39:15.083]  And the vaccinated are now growing spike proteins that are jumping into people and making them sick as well.
[00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:23.671]  But if you look at the statistics out of Australia, and the statistics out of Gibraltar, and out of Singapore, out of Israel,
[00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:26.552]  There's one right there.
[00:39:26.552 --> 00:39:30.554]  Jerusalem Hospital, 85 to 90% of cases are people who are vaccinated.
[00:39:30.554 --> 00:39:32.214]  And that's old news.
[00:39:32.214 --> 00:39:33.855]  That's from yesterday.
[00:39:33.855 --> 00:39:39.977]  Now it's 95% the National Health Service says.
[00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.418]  So think about that.
[00:39:41.418 --> 00:39:42.558]  And again, they're spinning it.
[00:39:42.558 --> 00:39:47.340]  Well, it's because of the Delta variant.
[00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:52.253]  And then Congress goes, give us a scan of that Delta variant, show us that virus.
[00:39:52.253 --> 00:39:55.476]  Because normally when they find a new virus, they publish it in an international database.
[00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:56.777]  There's also a national database.
[00:39:56.777 --> 00:40:04.442]  No one will put it on the database!
[00:40:04.442 --> 00:40:08.425]  The Indians and the Australians claim they got a copy of it and said it was man-made.
[00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:08.846]  Remember that?
[00:40:10.089 --> 00:40:13.216]  So people say, well, the virus doesn't exist.
[00:40:13.216 --> 00:40:14.700]  That's why they won't put it on a database.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.045]  No, the damn thing looks like Frankenstein.
[00:40:17.045 --> 00:40:19.210]  It's got five viruses hammered together.
[00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:19.591]  It's real.
[00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:25.032]  But it killed people with a spike protein, not with its replication.
[00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:25.612]  Overall.
[00:40:25.612 --> 00:40:27.773]  That's what the medical stuff shows.
[00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:31.954]  The research, the white papers, the studies.
[00:40:31.954 --> 00:40:44.277]  But now, just what the actual Nobel Prize winners predicted, and what the actual former head of Pfizer said, it will then make what happened from the virus look like a cakewalk, and be much worse.
[00:40:44.277 --> 00:40:44.677]  And it is.
[00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:49.344]  And you got to really hand it to Bill Gates and the globalists that came up with this.
[00:40:49.344 --> 00:41:00.948]  This is something where you go voluntarily take it and then you grow the shell of the virus in you and infect everybody, including yourself.
[00:41:00.948 --> 00:41:02.409]  And that doesn't matter, you see.
[00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:06.250]  There's all these patents from Bill Gates and all these Fauci patents and UN patents on
[00:41:07.944 --> 00:41:10.326]  Vaccines that vaccinate others.
[00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:15.629]  Like, oh, we've just got to vaccinate one part of the village, and then the live virus will vaccinate the rest.
[00:41:15.629 --> 00:41:16.830]  And it's like, oh, how wonderful.
[00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.151]  Bill Gates came up with that.
[00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:20.573]  He funded that.
[00:41:20.573 --> 00:41:22.274]  Self-replicating vaccines.
[00:41:22.274 --> 00:41:23.675]  Self-spreading vaccines.
[00:41:23.675 --> 00:41:24.496]  Look it up.
[00:41:24.496 --> 00:41:27.298]  Look up vaccines for birth control.
[00:41:27.298 --> 00:41:28.158]  Look up the UN.
[00:41:28.158 --> 00:41:28.719]  Look it all up.
[00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:31.941]  And they did it to us, folks.
[00:41:31.941 --> 00:41:35.383]  They didn't spend trillions of dollars.
[00:41:35.383 --> 00:41:36.384]  They didn't take over the world.
[00:41:40.643 --> 00:41:51.427]  They didn't do all of this for no reason.
[00:41:51.427 --> 00:41:55.728]  They did it because they want total power and control over the genetic future of humanity.
[00:41:55.728 --> 00:42:05.211]  They want to alter our DNA when they want, they want to decide who can have children and who can't, and they want to depopulate the vast majority of people, and they're doing it.
[00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:07.812]  And I just sit here in absolute horror watching this all unfold.
[00:42:10.953 --> 00:42:11.733]  God help us.
[00:42:11.733 --> 00:42:16.035]  All right, I'm going to go to break and come back with what is one of the top stories in the world right now.
[00:42:16.035 --> 00:42:18.917]  Thanks to Jack Posobiec and people sharing it.
[00:42:18.917 --> 00:42:21.358]  It was number one for a while on Twitter yesterday.
[00:42:21.358 --> 00:42:22.358]  Millions of people saw it.
[00:42:22.358 --> 00:42:24.699]  A lot of articles got written about it.
[00:42:24.699 --> 00:42:26.700]  And that's good.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.302]  And I know it sounded macabre when I came out and said they're keeping babies alive.
[00:42:31.302 --> 00:42:32.603]  But I mean, it's in the literature.
[00:42:32.603 --> 00:42:33.083]  They're doing it.
[00:42:34.775 --> 00:42:39.818]  It's just that, oh, that's not acceptable to say, because that obviously can't happen in America, right?
[00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:43.201]  I mean, obviously.
[00:42:43.201 --> 00:42:48.044]  Obviously, 95% of those in the hospitals don't have the vaccine, but they do.
[00:42:48.044 --> 00:42:50.646]  I mean, it's like, it's the vaccine.
[00:42:50.646 --> 00:42:51.927]  It's the vaccine.
[00:42:51.927 --> 00:42:53.368]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:42:53.368 --> 00:42:54.889]  It's a farming agent.
[00:42:54.889 --> 00:42:57.791]  It's a protein crystal that grows in you and kills you.
[00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:03.087]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[00:43:03.087 --> 00:43:07.190]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.511]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here.
[00:43:09.511 --> 00:43:14.294]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[00:43:14.294 --> 00:43:18.016]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[00:43:18.436 --> 00:43:26.941]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[00:43:26.941 --> 00:43:34.286]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:43:38.428 --> 00:43:45.773]  That's why it's a flash sale of Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, our Greens Formula, of course our high-quality Vitamin D3 Formula with Calcium.
[00:43:46.294 --> 00:43:50.662]  Then we have the 1100% of your daily allowance, Vitamin C with Zinc.

[00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:02.345]  The biosecurity state is here.
[00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:08.270]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:22.043]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[00:44:23.484 --> 00:44:26.685]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[00:44:26.685 --> 00:44:30.706]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[00:44:30.706 --> 00:44:32.466]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:44:32.466 --> 00:44:35.147]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[00:44:35.147 --> 00:44:37.408]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.968]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:44:39.968 --> 00:44:49.551]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Philharmonic Institute in Germany.
[00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:51.655]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:53.680]  We fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.044]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[00:44:55.044 --> 00:44:56.668]  God bless and good luck.
[00:44:56.668 --> 00:44:58.192]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[00:45:00.444 --> 00:45:06.866]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[00:45:06.866 --> 00:45:14.249]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:21.112]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[00:45:21.112 --> 00:45:24.273]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[00:45:24.273 --> 00:45:26.634]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[00:45:26.994 --> 00:45:33.157]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul.
[00:45:33.157 --> 00:45:40.679]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[00:45:40.679 --> 00:45:45.661]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:54.145]  Our water filtration systems, with the proper filters, will keep your drinking water fluoride-free, and the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[00:45:54.785 --> 00:46:00.307]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at InfowarStore.com.
[00:46:00.307 --> 00:46:07.830]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:13.352]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[00:46:13.352 --> 00:46:20.935]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:22.677]  Humanity is strong.
[00:46:22.677 --> 00:46:23.637]  We're incredible.
[00:46:23.637 --> 00:46:27.421]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:29.884]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:46:29.884 --> 00:46:36.210]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:45.579]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[00:46:45.879 --> 00:46:48.201]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:48.201 --> 00:46:50.863]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:56.188]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[00:46:56.188 --> 00:47:03.434]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:47:03.434 --> 00:47:06.096]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:33.000]  By the way, when I start the next hour, I'm going to tell you about Ghislaine Maxwell's buddies
[00:47:48.527 --> 00:47:53.850]  Over at the Atlantic Magazine, quite the party over there.
[00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:59.393]  And we got the editor of it who used to work at a torture base in Israel.
[00:47:59.393 --> 00:48:08.859]  Wants to set up internal checkpoints in America and make us take poison vaccines to be able to get on airplanes to have an actual database.
[00:48:08.859 --> 00:48:15.883]  We're going to tell you about Lawrence Powell Jobs, owner of the Atlantic Magazine and Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:48:15.883 --> 00:48:16.524]  Got some new
[00:48:17.816 --> 00:48:22.798]  Fun stuff coming out with the girls in bikinis.
[00:48:22.798 --> 00:48:26.419]  Let's just say it's a lot of fun when you're a psychotic.
[00:48:26.419 --> 00:48:33.482]  I think it's time to really start spotlighting these people, isn't it?
[00:48:33.482 --> 00:48:36.263]  It's time to take the gloves off, like they say.
[00:48:36.263 --> 00:48:43.405]  Since folks keep looking for a confrontation, sometimes they find it, don't they?
[00:48:43.405 --> 00:48:44.766]  Sometimes people get what they want.
[00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:51.393]  Sometimes they just push, push a little too hard.
[00:48:51.393 --> 00:49:05.528]  When I got visited by Goldberg to do their little assessment, I played dumb to buy time under the radar while I built the program to take them down.
[00:49:05.528 --> 00:49:07.890]  What a scared little man.
[00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.051]  And they did buy it.
[00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:09.812]  That was the good point.
[00:49:16.476 --> 00:49:25.218]  At the end of the day, everyone will be judged.
[00:49:25.218 --> 00:49:28.719]  And not everybody will be treated the same, as they say.
[00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:34.401]  Okay, so let's look at the little darling of the Rockefellers and the New World Order.
[00:49:35.916 --> 00:49:44.561]  Dr. Fauci funds organ trafficking from aborted babies, helping researchers craft baby scalps onto rodents.
[00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:56.907]  Now that came out in May, seems like a hundred years ago, from government documents that Judicial Watch and a bunch of other pro-life groups, life sites, went all over and got out.
[00:49:56.907 --> 00:49:58.848]  But that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:50:01.817 --> 00:50:05.761]  They're not just funny experiments with aborted fetal scalp scraps on the rats.
[00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:09.884]  They're keeping babies alive.
[00:50:09.884 --> 00:50:13.648]  But, you know, no one seems to be really upset about that.
[00:50:13.648 --> 00:50:14.749]  That's just a human.
[00:50:14.749 --> 00:50:17.331]  Screw them.
[00:50:17.331 --> 00:50:25.179]  But they are upset about Fauci and the dogs.
[00:50:25.179 --> 00:50:26.520]  And I'm a dog lover myself.
[00:50:29.189 --> 00:50:34.710]  It's a big article on Infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:37.811]  Fauci oversaw dangerous, torturous experiments on dogs.
[00:50:37.811 --> 00:50:50.294]  So, why should I tell you about kidnapped babies in snuff films, or kids spliced with animals so they have no rights and can be harvested, or babies taken at birth and kept alive while they get auctions going for their body parts?
[00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:53.303]  Who cares about that?
[00:50:53.303 --> 00:50:54.806]  Screw humans, they're bad, right?
[00:50:54.806 --> 00:50:57.049]  Planned Parenthood told me so.
[00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:58.291]  CNN told me there's too many people.
[00:50:58.291 --> 00:50:59.192]  Okay.
[00:50:59.192 --> 00:51:00.273]  But the doggies!
[00:51:03.419 --> 00:51:22.950]  In addition to overseeing funding of gain-of-function coronavirus experiments in Wuhan and then lying about it, it has now emerged that Dr. Fauci was in charge of funding horrid experimental research on dogs, including purposely infecting animals with parasites known to be contagious to humans, because they were studying how to give humans this.
[00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:30.874]  A report from the White Coat Waste Project draws on information gained by a Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch.
[00:51:33.162 --> 00:51:41.989]  400,000 was pumped into the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease experiments to infect beagles with parasites from biting flies.
[00:51:41.989 --> 00:51:52.417]  The report outlines how the dogs endured months of pain, and once researchers had eaten them alive with maggots, when they were done with them, they were killed.
[00:51:52.417 --> 00:51:54.258]  The maggot, the maggot lust.
[00:51:54.258 --> 00:51:56.840]  Yes, that's part of the, the maggoting is one of the religious rites.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.582]  I've told you about maggoting.
[00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:01.244]  Guys, Google, find Alex Jones on maggoting years ago.
[00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:07.102]  I'm serious, they actually maggot troops in rituals at U.S.
[00:52:07.102 --> 00:52:09.243]  military bases at the VA.
[00:52:09.243 --> 00:52:19.588]  They just put the flies in their nostrils, up in the sinus to lay eggs, and then they just like veterans having maggots eat their brains.
[00:52:19.588 --> 00:52:24.130]  I'm not kidding, but here it is right here, maggots eating dogs, so let me continue.
[00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:29.653]  The report outlines how dogs endured months of pain, and once researchers were done with them, they were killed.
[00:52:30.877 --> 00:52:42.023]  The NIAID test order states that 28 beagles were to be allowed to develop infections for three months before being euthanized for blood collection.
[00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:47.946]  The records obtained during the FOI request show the dogs vocalized pain during the experiments.
[00:52:47.946 --> 00:52:50.027]  You didn't like maggots?
[00:52:50.027 --> 00:52:51.788]  Special screwworms eating you?
[00:52:51.788 --> 00:52:53.269]  Who had been eradicated in the U.S.
[00:52:53.269 --> 00:52:55.290]  but thought she was bringing back screwworms.
[00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.592]  Torturing and killing dogs, the most loving and innocent creatures on Earth,
[00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.991]  I disagree with Steve Watts.
[00:53:00.991 --> 00:53:03.332]  I think children are more loving, but I love dogs.
[00:53:03.332 --> 00:53:08.595]  With deadly parasites that are extremely dangerous to people, can this guy get more evil?
[00:53:08.595 --> 00:53:09.675]  What's next?
[00:53:09.675 --> 00:53:13.217]  Funding for research on the temperature it's best to roast newborn babies?
[00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:14.978]  Well, we already sell their organs, why not?
[00:53:14.978 --> 00:53:25.644]  Breaking down the report, Fox News host Ben Domenech noted that if Dr. Fauci thought Rand Paul was mad at him, wait until the animal activists see this.
[00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:26.365]  Actually, PETA
[00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:31.958]  It's controlled by eugenicists and Dr. Peter Singer and actually likes all of this.
[00:53:31.958 --> 00:53:42.024]  And I told you before it ever came out on the news that PETA pressures its members to go adopt dogs and cats so the leadership of PETA can sacrifice them.
[00:53:42.024 --> 00:53:43.705]  By the way, I'm not saying any of this for effect.
[00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:46.927]  This is all true.
[00:53:46.927 --> 00:53:50.289]  See, the people that tell you they care about dogs and cats don't.
[00:53:52.165 --> 00:53:54.508]  They just want you to see them as the leader.
[00:53:54.508 --> 00:53:58.532]  Like, oh, we're guarding the earth from carbon that plants breathe.
[00:53:58.532 --> 00:54:02.577]  Oh, while they engage in the destruction of earth.
[00:54:02.577 --> 00:54:03.799]  So this went viral.
[00:54:03.799 --> 00:54:04.960]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.304]  Goes viral on Twitter for exposing fetal organ harvesting.
[00:54:10.509 --> 00:54:17.614]  And it became a really, really big, you know, top story out there and got picked up by a lot of large publications.
[00:54:17.614 --> 00:54:23.299]  And, you know, I've just run out of time on this subject, and I really need to get back into it.
[00:54:23.299 --> 00:54:31.165]  Plus, there's this new Ghislaine Maxwell Atlantic Monthly Atlantic Council News, the Jeffrey Epstein Council.
[00:54:31.165 --> 00:54:32.986]  And I mean, these are gods up above us.
[00:54:32.986 --> 00:54:33.987]  These are lords.
[00:54:33.987 --> 00:54:34.768]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:54:34.768 --> 00:54:37.150]  But we're going to talk about these lofty
[00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:48.006]  These lofty individuals, they're just so powerful that we can't even imagine the visions of their mind.
[00:54:48.006 --> 00:54:56.511]  Even though I'm so sad for them, I think they're going to end up in fates far worse than Jeffrey in that jail cell, or Ghislaine in that jail cell.
[00:54:56.511 --> 00:55:04.337]  Something tells me that they don't have to wait until they die to suffer payment for what they've done in retribution.
[00:55:06.044 --> 00:55:09.467]  Something tells me it's going to happen over and over again.
[00:55:09.467 --> 00:55:10.989]  That's the way the universe works.
[00:55:10.989 --> 00:55:17.955]  Goodness, victory, and love, and passion, and honor just happens over and over again where it happens.
[00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:22.319]  But where dishonor and evil happens, it so grows there.
[00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:23.721]  So let us not hate these people.
[00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:31.248]  Let us turn from their stench and just thank God and the stars he created that we are not with those people.
[00:55:32.216 --> 00:55:48.962]  And their abomination, desolation, and their system of Satan, their church of destruction, their church of failure, their temple of weakness.
[00:55:48.962 --> 00:55:51.343]  Separately, there isn't a place in the world
[00:55:52.145 --> 00:55:55.746]  That you can fund that's more aggressive in the fight against tyranny.
[00:55:55.746 --> 00:56:00.787]  And I'm just blessed every day, every minute we're here is just all cake, as they say.
[00:56:00.787 --> 00:56:04.968]  We've definitely gone in through and beyond, and now we're on the other side of the new order takeover.
[00:56:04.968 --> 00:56:08.929]  And I never thought I'd actually make it into the takeover period, but it just shows how weak they are.
[00:56:08.929 --> 00:56:14.230]  And we're still contending, even in their main assault, they would probably fail if they had total air superiority.
[00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.670]  They don't.
[00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.051]  So they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:18.051 --> 00:56:19.191]  So I do take some pleasure in that.
[00:56:21.042 --> 00:56:31.554]  I just hope that listeners will understand that Mike Lindell is also fighting hard under incredible demonization attacks when you go to MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com and use promo code ALEX.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.543]  That you will get the highest sale discounts that there are out there at MyPillow.com.
[00:56:38.543 --> 00:56:43.105]  They have great slippers, great shoes, great beds for humans, dogs, and cats.
[00:56:43.105 --> 00:56:47.687]  Not the dogs being tortured to death by Fauci with maggots they can plant on their bodies.
[00:56:47.687 --> 00:56:52.570]  And also they have amazing pillows, well known for that, and towels and sheets.
[00:56:54.215 --> 00:56:55.096]  And so much more.
[00:56:55.096 --> 00:56:56.798]  And so, listen, we're fighting.
[00:56:56.798 --> 00:56:58.780]  You want people to fight on the field for freedom?
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.621]  We're doing it.
[00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:05.188]  So it's a chance to support what he's doing, exposing election scams and fraud, and to help what we're doing.
[00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:09.012]  So MyPillow.com and promo code Alex.
[00:57:09.012 --> 00:57:11.515]  Oh, and by the way, Mike Lindell's got big breaking news.
[00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:13.777]  He's joining us in the third hour today.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.663]  And then separately, we've got a big sale that's a flash sale for several of these is going to end this weekend.
[00:57:19.663 --> 00:57:23.185]  That's BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, selling out quick, 50% off.
[00:57:23.185 --> 00:57:25.466]  TURBO Force, 10-hour clean energy, 50% off.
[00:57:25.466 --> 00:57:27.567]  Those will end by the weekend.
[00:57:27.567 --> 00:57:28.848]  Lung Cleanse, 50% off.
[00:57:28.848 --> 00:57:30.269]  Vitamin C with Zinc, 50% off.
[00:57:30.269 --> 00:57:34.071]  Vitamin D3 gummies with the calcium for your immune system, those are 50% off.
[00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:37.353]  Those will end about a week because we've still got some supplies of that.
[00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:39.615]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:39.615 --> 00:57:43.297]  And I want to thank you for helping us stay on air in the face of these enemies.
[00:57:43.777 --> 00:57:45.658]  Hour number two is straight ahead.
[00:57:45.658 --> 00:57:47.259]  Please stay with us.
[00:57:47.259 --> 00:57:49.360]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:55.442]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:57:55.442 --> 00:58:02.946]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:05.247]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:58:05.247 --> 00:58:08.848]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:58:10.749 --> 00:58:18.914]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[00:58:55.493 --> 00:58:56.654]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:59:03.203 --> 00:59:04.723]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:59:04.723 --> 00:59:06.284]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:59:06.284 --> 00:59:07.664]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline.
[00:59:07.664 --> 00:59:09.104]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store... Wait!

[00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.210]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.871]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:39.291]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:40.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:24.884]  Remember, the border's wide open while they're telling you you've got to go under lockdown.
[01:00:24.884 --> 01:00:26.205]  InfoWars.
[01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:28.986]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:00:29.551 --> 01:00:36.262]  One of the biggest developments the last year and a half of this insane COVID saga has now taken place.
[01:00:37.415 --> 01:00:42.399]  As most of you know, we've been down to the border six, seven times with our crew in the last year and a half.
[01:00:42.399 --> 01:00:45.721]  It is wide open on the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:00:45.721 --> 01:00:55.168]  We were just there a month ago, and they reported that over a thousand people a week are dumped off at one Catholic charity, many of which are COVID positive.
[01:00:55.168 --> 01:00:59.491]  And when they're COVID positive, because they test them right there, they don't send them back to Mexico.
[01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:00.972]  They don't send them to the hospital.
[01:01:00.972 --> 01:01:02.093]  They don't send them to quarantine.
[01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:03.234]  They dump them out on the street.
[01:01:03.874 --> 01:01:08.081]  Well now, today, McAllen has announced an emergency.
[01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:12.028]  Just as they started counting a few weeks ago, 7,000 positive COVID individuals
[01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:16.173]  We're good to go.
[01:01:40.922 --> 01:01:50.964]  One border crossing in South Texas alone, 7,000 plus people, 1,000 in the last week alone who are COVID positive.
[01:01:50.964 --> 01:01:53.905]  And remember, we sent a crew down there just a week ago.
[01:01:53.905 --> 01:02:02.787]  It was reported that people that are actually sick, coughing and have trouble breathing, men, women, and children are dumped off at Whataburgers.
[01:02:02.787 --> 01:02:05.188]  So according to Biden, this is a serious crime.
[01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.648]  According to Biden, this is a serious threat.
[01:02:07.861 --> 01:02:11.142]  But because this is part of his larger agenda to collapse our borders, they're doing it.
[01:02:11.142 --> 01:02:13.883]  This proves the whole COVID thing is a power grab.
[01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:14.943]  It's not about keeping us safe.
[01:02:14.943 --> 01:02:16.744]  It's not about keeping us from dying.
[01:02:16.744 --> 01:02:27.027]  It's about the control they can use against citizens who they just claim, oh, the contact tracing app on your phone says you came close to somebody.
[01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:28.188]  We need you to go to quarantine.
[01:02:28.188 --> 01:02:34.970]  But when you've actually got COVID and you're actually sick, not asymptomatic, you're then dumped down the street.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.602]  This is the smoking gun of smoking guns.
[01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:41.083]  And again, it just shows the U.N.
[01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.685]  has done a worldwide lockdown for over a year and a half.
[01:02:44.685 --> 01:02:46.726]  It's caused millions to starve to death.
[01:02:46.726 --> 01:02:49.107]  It's caused the third world to collapse.
[01:02:49.107 --> 01:02:52.549]  Eight out of 10 migrants who are asked, why are you flood the U.S.
[01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:59.593]  from Latin America, from Africa, from Asia, from the Middle East, say, after a lockdown, there's no jobs, no farming, no business.
[01:02:59.593 --> 01:03:01.994]  So I don't blame these people trying to come here.
[01:03:01.994 --> 01:03:04.696]  But most of them are coming here without any money, without any
[01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:08.972]  I don't see how Biden can do a new lockdown.
[01:03:08.972 --> 01:03:13.115]  I don't see how Biden can do anything other than be impeached for what he's been doing because
[01:03:31.263 --> 01:03:43.153]  For months and months and months, we have pointed out that open border is allowing a lot of serious disease in, including bubonic plague that's now spread in California, Nevada, and Colorado.
[01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:50.359]  They're closing down major parts of the country because of the black plague that's killed hundreds of millions of people before.
[01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.921]  And again, that's part of the open border, and it's the same thing with COVID.
[01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:57.224]  I'll be covering this tomorrow on my syndicated radio show, 11 to 3 p.m.
[01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.125]  Central.
[01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.046]  The Daily Caller article is very, very important.
[01:04:00.046 --> 01:04:06.712]  I suggest you share this report with everyone you know because this just proves they're not trying to shut things down to protect us from COVID.
[01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:18.603]  They're shutting things down selectively to bankrupt the economy, put us onto a social credit score, put us onto universal basic income, and bankrupt the mainstream economy by saying that small businesses are not essential.
[01:04:18.603 --> 01:04:20.965]  This is a corporate consolidation of power and control.
[01:04:21.605 --> 01:04:23.026]  Nothing to do with safety.
[01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:32.672]  And what Biden's done with months of notice about the COVID surging across the border proves it a hundred percent, and he should be impeached right now for it.
[01:04:32.672 --> 01:04:37.936]  But regardless, the open border and Biden saying immediately surge the border.
[01:04:37.936 --> 01:04:45.361]  If I'm elected, this was all done premeditatedly and Congress must act to rein in this rogue president and secure our border.
[01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:51.285]  Now it's in the constitution that one of the few actions the federal government has jurisdiction over is our border.
[01:04:51.705 --> 01:04:55.688]  That's one of the few areas that they are completely derelict in right now.
[01:04:55.688 --> 01:04:56.829]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:59.931]  Please spread the word about this report and hopefully we'll be able to stop.
[01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:29.852]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:05:29.852 --> 01:05:35.757]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:46.485]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:47.766]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:54.759]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:06:17.535 --> 01:06:23.039]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:35.027]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.027 --> 01:06:42.833]  So, people ask me, why didn't you cover Bill Gates a few days ago when he was on with the Vanderbilt Anderson Cooper?
[01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:44.794]  Probably richer than him.
[01:06:44.794 --> 01:06:45.935]  Real wealth has their money hidden.
[01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:51.700]  Talking about he's sorry for meeting with Jeffrey Epstein and his relationship with him.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:07:01.165]  Because we already exposed that years ago, over a decade ago, the fact that Bill Gates lied about all of that.
[01:07:01.165 --> 01:07:13.251]  Bill Gates used to live with him when he was in Paris, London, and New York, and Zorro Ranch, and of course, the pervert pedophile island.
[01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:13.991]  Little St.
[01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:14.972]  Perverts, Little St.
[01:07:14.972 --> 01:07:15.232]  Johns.
[01:07:16.852 --> 01:07:19.514]  So that's what they do.
[01:07:19.514 --> 01:07:21.555]  And that's who they are.
[01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:25.258]  And so now his wife knows that's all coming out, so she's left it.
[01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:25.518]  Ms.
[01:07:25.518 --> 01:07:28.881]  French.
[01:07:28.881 --> 01:07:32.924]  But let's talk about the latest before I get back into Bill Gates.
[01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:35.986]  Now it ties into the Atlantic Monthly and those people.
[01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:42.911]  Democrat State Senator Tony Navarrete arrested on suspicion of sex with a minor.
[01:07:46.135 --> 01:07:50.199]  And we've also got photos of him with Pelosi and with all the top Democrats.
[01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:54.422]  I mean, they're like arresting one of these guys every day, it seems.
[01:07:54.422 --> 01:08:03.030]  State Senator Tony Navarrete, a Phoenix Democrat, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of multiple counts of sexual conduct with a minor.
[01:08:04.008 --> 01:08:10.418]  Navarrete was arrested on 27th Avenue and Bethany Home Road and booked into the Maricopa County Jail.
[01:08:10.418 --> 01:08:15.165]  Police records show, in addition, being booked on suspicion of four counts of sexual conduct with a minor.
[01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:18.930]  There are other charges police said, without elaborating, police said they received a report.
[01:08:19.781 --> 01:08:24.004]  of at least one alleged incident that occurred in 2019.
[01:08:24.004 --> 01:08:26.827]  This arrest whipped through the political circles Thursday night.
[01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:35.113]  In a statement Thursday, Senator Democrats said, we are aware of our members have been arrested and are awaiting further details and law enforcement to do its job.
[01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:38.616]  We will not have further comment about that.
[01:08:38.616 --> 01:08:46.302]  Navarrete 35, Nosferatu, was elected to the House in 2016 to serve one term before being elected to the State Senate.
[01:08:49.414 --> 01:08:55.876]  And there he is with guys in the ceremonial garb.
[01:08:55.876 --> 01:09:00.717]  I could show you the videos of the folks saying, we are groomers, we're coming for your children.
[01:09:00.717 --> 01:09:02.138]  It's always that similar garb.
[01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:04.978]  Maybe they're just magically wearing it by accident.
[01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:12.441]  But they're pirates, and they're coming for our liberty, and they're coming for control of our lives, in my view.
[01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:15.842]  But I don't think it's my opinion that this country is in the clutches of serious
[01:09:17.606 --> 01:09:19.707]  Serious, serious evil.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:24.028]  In fact, we've got a three-minute compilation, a five-minute compilation, an eight-minute compilation.
[01:09:24.028 --> 01:09:29.990]  Why don't you guys get one of the compilations together on, we're grooming your kids, we're coming for them, we're going to get them, they belong to us.
[01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:34.552]  You know, we had that compilation long before they had the San Francisco Choir.
[01:09:34.552 --> 01:09:40.394]  We're going to corrupt your kids, we're going to get them, you're never going to stop us, they belong to us now, we're coming for them, we're going to recruit them.
[01:09:40.394 --> 01:09:41.535]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:09:41.535 --> 01:09:45.256]  This is an assault of all these weaklings.
[01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:51.192]  And all these people that have been recruited into this evil.
[01:09:51.192 --> 01:09:54.233]  Now, speaking of weaklings, look at this headline.
[01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:55.194]  The Atlantic!
[01:09:55.194 --> 01:09:58.376]  Unvaccinated people belong on a no-fly list!
[01:09:58.376 --> 01:10:04.139]  Senator Paul has come out and said these are nightmare authoritarians, but what they're telling you is what Biden's getting ready to do.
[01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:06.614]  Now we need to back Biden off.
[01:10:06.614 --> 01:10:09.315]  They'll say, oh, Jones finally was wrong about something.
[01:10:09.315 --> 01:10:14.417]  No, I want to put pressure on him to the governors of the states and say, no, you're not putting us on no-fly list.
[01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:19.018]  We haven't taken your experimental shot that almost everyone sick and dying has taken.
[01:10:19.018 --> 01:10:24.861]  All over the world, they admit, 95% of the people in the hospitals who are seriously ill had the shot.
[01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:29.463]  Most of those dying had the shot, the opposite of what Fauci said.
[01:10:29.463 --> 01:10:32.504]  The Atlantic says unvaccinated people belong on a no-fly list.
[01:10:39.202 --> 01:10:40.622]  Now let's look at some of these folks.
[01:10:40.622 --> 01:10:45.224]  You've got the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, publishing this article.
[01:10:45.224 --> 01:10:56.168]  He's the same guy that said that we should attack Iraq and made up WMDs.
[01:10:56.168 --> 01:11:02.190]  You've got the Obama Homeland Security official, Juliette Kayyem, calling for unvaccinated people to be put on no-fly lists.
[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:07.092]  Remember what they're calling for is an ID and a medical system with them in your life.
[01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:15.436]  But let's look at who owns the Atlantic.
[01:11:15.436 --> 01:11:16.236]  Let's look at that.
[01:11:16.236 --> 01:11:17.577]  Here it is.
[01:11:17.577 --> 01:11:18.357]  This is a photo.
[01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:21.338]  We can put the actual digital copy up, please, on screen.
[01:11:21.338 --> 01:11:24.138]  This is Ms.
[01:11:24.138 --> 01:11:29.540]  Jobs, the former wife of Steve Jobs.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.820]  Lauren Powell Jobs.
[01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:36.182]  Owner of the Atlantic Magazine and Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:11:36.182 --> 01:11:48.051]  And she spends as much money or more as George Soros funding all the sexualization of kids, and all the transgenderism, and all the open borders, and all the gun control, and all the media censorship.
[01:11:48.051 --> 01:11:52.374]  She spends billions of dollars a year.
[01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:56.037]  And there she is with Ghislaine in their tropical retreat.
[01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:58.913]  Having a great time.
[01:11:58.913 --> 01:12:08.877]  These are powerful, empowered women showing the world they rule us.
[01:12:08.877 --> 01:12:11.838]  And after all, they're women, so they're allowed to.
[01:12:11.838 --> 01:12:12.839]  They're having fun.
[01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:15.319]  They're learning how to dominate everybody.
[01:12:15.319 --> 01:12:16.940]  Yeah, there's another photo of them together.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.681]  Aren't they sweet?
[01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:24.663]  You'll soon pay for what you've done, monsters.
[01:12:26.206 --> 01:12:28.628]  Lauren Powell Jobs and Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:12:28.628 --> 01:12:35.292]  What darling little friends flying around the Lita Express together.
[01:12:35.292 --> 01:12:38.094]  Doing whatever they want, however they want.
[01:12:38.094 --> 01:12:39.615]  Everything they do is about hurting children.
[01:12:39.615 --> 01:12:41.856]  Everything they do is about destroying innocents.
[01:12:41.856 --> 01:12:47.240]  Everything they do is about raping us with a deadly GMO shot that grows blood clots in us and now they want our children.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.781]  They're just like, give us the children.
[01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.802]  Give us the children, let us give them shots.
[01:12:50.802 --> 01:12:54.125]  Don't question, don't, when kids die or people get sick, don't talk about it.
[01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:55.706]  Just shut up like Bill Gates.
[01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:59.393]  Has always taught us.
[01:12:59.393 --> 01:13:00.634]  But where is Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:13:00.634 --> 01:13:04.657]  He's... He's where you guys are gonna be.
[01:13:04.657 --> 01:13:06.218]  Soon enough, ladies.
[01:13:06.218 --> 01:13:08.160]  You're gonna face God.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.363]  You're evil, bad people.
[01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:13.604]  And you're monsters.
[01:13:13.604 --> 01:13:16.887]  Just like Juliette Kingham.
[01:13:16.887 --> 01:13:19.910]  Who's all the big, fancy-pants lady.
[01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:23.072]  She's like the witch in Snow White.
[01:13:23.072 --> 01:13:26.635]  Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most disgusting of them all?
[01:13:29.275 --> 01:13:50.610]  And they're all super evil, creepy women that have been brought up and raised and trained by their fathers, like Ghislaine Maxwell's father, an Israeli slash MI6 agent who ran sex operations across England and is credited with basically creating pedophilia systems to control all the British Isles.
[01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.373]  These are some sick, sick, sick puppies.
[01:13:54.373 --> 01:13:56.995]  And they found it's much more successful having a woman
[01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:07.154]  I guess a woman that would consider herself attractive to seduce everyone into this culture and into these systems.
[01:14:07.154 --> 01:14:14.499]  Oh, I'm not saying this woman, Juliette Kayyem, working with these other women and hanging out with these women is like they are.
[01:14:14.499 --> 01:14:18.282]  I mean, undoubtedly, these guys, their whole agenda and what they do is who they are.
[01:14:18.282 --> 01:14:20.283]  No one of them is locked up for it right now.
[01:14:20.283 --> 01:14:27.789]  I'm just saying that if I was going to cast somebody as a witch that feeds on children, I'd hire Juliette Kayyem.
[01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:31.657]  And there she is with Daddy.
[01:14:31.657 --> 01:14:34.057]  Daddy and his little girlfriend.
[01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:36.898]  He trained her real early as a sex operative.
[01:14:36.898 --> 01:14:39.099]  Probably three.
[01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:40.219]  There she is with Daddy.
[01:14:40.219 --> 01:14:43.400]  How'd Daddy end up falling off that boat in the Atlantic Ocean?
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.460]  That didn't go too well, did it?
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.501]  And where are you now?
[01:14:46.501 --> 01:14:49.942]  Where's Daddy's world put you now, sweetheart?
[01:14:49.942 --> 01:14:51.122]  In that jail cell, huh?
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:00.882]  And then there's Lawrence Powell Jobs, who they think we're so stupid doesn't know finances the attacks on this operation.
[01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:03.543]  I'm glad you guys reminded me about her.
[01:15:03.543 --> 01:15:06.223]  What a nice person.
[01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:13.285]  I wonder what God is going to do to these people.
[01:15:13.285 --> 01:15:14.765]  I wonder.
[01:15:14.765 --> 01:15:20.167]  So, they're just trying to claw us down into hell with them.
[01:15:20.167 --> 01:15:20.867]  That's all they're doing.
[01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:26.254]  But all we got to do is persevere and hold fast and hold tight.
[01:15:26.254 --> 01:15:29.335]  We're going to win in the end.
[01:15:29.335 --> 01:15:32.276]  We got Mike Lindell joining us with big news.
[01:15:32.276 --> 01:15:34.257]  Start of the next hour as we fight back against these monsters.
[01:15:34.257 --> 01:15:36.378]  I think they're so cool and so powerful.
[01:15:36.378 --> 01:15:43.962]  And I'm going to finish up on the organ harvesting of babies after they're born and kept in facilities where they're being murdered around the U.S.
[01:15:43.962 --> 01:15:46.523]  I'll just tell you about that.
[01:15:46.523 --> 01:15:50.345]  Of course, you know, you don't want to talk about that or you don't want to save them either.
[01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.146]  I mean, you might get arrested, right?
[01:15:52.146 --> 01:15:52.246]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.208]  Exactly.
[01:15:53.208 --> 01:16:01.453]  The FBI would probably get you if you tried to save a baby that's about to have its organs taken at 10 months old.
[01:16:01.453 --> 01:16:03.534]  Your voice counts.
[01:16:03.534 --> 01:16:08.596]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:16:08.596 --> 01:16:11.198]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:16:11.198 --> 01:16:12.678]  They know you're angry.
[01:16:12.678 --> 01:16:17.501]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.478]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.160]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.101]  That was a crazy week.
[01:19:12.101 --> 01:19:23.796]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:19:23.796 --> 01:19:25.098]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[01:19:26.587 --> 01:19:28.968]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:19:28.968 --> 01:19:30.369]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:19:30.369 --> 01:19:34.611]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:36.952]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:19:36.952 --> 01:19:38.353]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:19:38.353 --> 01:19:39.154]  It's never happened to me.
[01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:42.075]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:19:42.075 --> 01:19:43.776]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:19:43.916 --> 01:19:46.677]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:19:46.677 --> 01:19:54.659]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:57.960]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:02.721]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:20:02.721 --> 01:20:05.342]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.742 --> 01:20:23.071]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:56.558]  So, Australia has 21% of their population vaccinated and
[01:21:11.668 --> 01:21:31.242]  99 plus percent of the hospitalized, this is in the News of Australia, this is in ABC News, which is separate than our ABC, it's the Australian Broadcasting System company, are reporting that thousands of people are in the hospital from COVID and one person wasn't vaccinated.
[01:21:31.242 --> 01:21:37.106]  So when I say 99, I mean what is about 3,000 plus are in the hospital they're saying and you've got
[01:21:38.343 --> 01:21:39.644]  One person wasn't vaccinated.
[01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:40.364]  That's like 99.999.
[01:21:40.364 --> 01:21:43.826]  I don't know what the math is on that.
[01:21:43.826 --> 01:21:48.868]  And then it's the same all over the world.
[01:21:48.868 --> 01:21:52.609]  So you can't say, oh, well, it's because, you know, these other companies have higher vaccine rates.
[01:21:52.609 --> 01:21:54.330]  So the new variant is just affecting that.
[01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:58.852]  No, it's a bunch of countries with super low vaccination rate.
[01:21:58.852 --> 01:22:02.394]  By the way, in India, they don't even take the same vaccines we do.
[01:22:02.394 --> 01:22:04.575]  The majority of their sick took the damn shot.
[01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:15.694]  Because they never created a vaccine for a cold virus because the cold virus is in a protein jacket that is the same as our body.
[01:22:15.694 --> 01:22:17.295]  Very simple.
[01:22:17.295 --> 01:22:19.256]  I could play you hundreds of doctors saying it.
[01:22:19.256 --> 01:22:20.557]  We already know it.
[01:22:20.557 --> 01:22:24.960]  Why did we never have a cold virus vaccine?
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:33.747]  Because it causes autoimmune responses and makes your body eat holes in itself and then you have strokes and heart attacks and your lungs fail.
[01:22:36.846 --> 01:22:45.532]  And so, these people have taken a shot that does this, and then they could shed it, that's confirmed, and give it to people.
[01:22:45.532 --> 01:22:50.256]  So every minute I'm on air just feels surreal right now.
[01:22:50.256 --> 01:23:04.947]  Every second I'm on air, I just cannot believe they actually did it, and an idiot could see they did it, and I try to explain this to lawyers I know, I try to explain this to people I know that have degrees, insurance salesmen, you know,
[01:23:05.919 --> 01:23:09.001]  And they're just like, but it's a variant.
[01:23:09.001 --> 01:23:13.203]  And I go, do you understand that that means the vaccine doesn't work?
[01:23:13.203 --> 01:23:18.727]  Even if you believe it's a variant and not the vaccine doing it, then that means it doesn't work.
[01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.628]  Why is it the majority of the vaccinated?
[01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.009]  Because it's a variant.
[01:23:22.009 --> 01:23:25.371]  It's like an idiocracy.
[01:23:25.371 --> 01:23:26.752]  They go, hey, I made the crops grow.
[01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.093]  Well, they put Gatorade on the crops called Brondo.
[01:23:29.093 --> 01:23:31.234]  He goes, you know, I think maybe you put water on it.
[01:23:31.234 --> 01:23:33.696]  That might make it, I mean, water like out of the toilet?
[01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:38.127]  I mean, it's like, maybe Bill Gates is right.
[01:23:38.127 --> 01:23:39.768]  Maybe we do not have to kill all these people.
[01:23:39.768 --> 01:23:41.069]  Maybe I'm on the wrong team.
[01:23:41.069 --> 01:23:49.956]  But I look at Ghislaine Maxwell and Steve Jobs' ex-wife, and I just think, you know, I don't want to hang around with them and, you know, molest little kids or whatever.
[01:23:49.956 --> 01:23:54.399]  I mean, you've got the idiot public that doesn't even know they're being murdered.
[01:23:54.399 --> 01:23:56.661]  You've got a bunch of vampire pedophiles.
[01:23:56.661 --> 01:23:59.203]  God Almighty, look at this demon on screen.
[01:23:59.203 --> 01:24:03.106]  UK transport minister says vaccines will be needed for travel forevermore.
[01:24:03.973 --> 01:24:05.575]  It's like a frickin' barracuda.
[01:24:05.575 --> 01:24:12.382]  I mean, that person's obviously a psychotic moron.
[01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:17.728]  And then you, so you've got the predators.
[01:24:17.728 --> 01:24:19.290]  And then you've got the prey.
[01:24:22.637 --> 01:24:25.760]  And then you've got those of us that just don't even know what to do.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:32.145]  Because, let me tell you, they're already telling the sheep that they're dying because we didn't take the shot.
[01:24:32.145 --> 01:24:36.968]  And the sheep are like, I took the shot, but I'm sick because you didn't take the shot.
[01:24:36.968 --> 01:24:39.210]  But almost everyone that took the shot is sick, not us.
[01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:41.092]  I don't care.
[01:24:41.092 --> 01:24:42.012]  You are bad.
[01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:44.574]  You need to burn your house down.
[01:24:44.574 --> 01:24:45.415]  That's right.
[01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:46.396]  That's what I need to do.
[01:24:52.315 --> 01:24:53.636]  Yep, Biden just came out.
[01:24:53.636 --> 01:25:01.342]  Remember he said that 200 million Americans died of COVID when it was less than 600,000?
[01:25:01.342 --> 01:25:02.723]  Well, now he's done some new math.
[01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:04.244]  We got that video next segment.
[01:25:04.244 --> 01:25:08.287]  He's out again in his brown suit.
[01:25:08.287 --> 01:25:16.674]  Biden says 350 million Americans are vaccinated, which of course is 20 million more than the entire population.
[01:25:18.683 --> 01:25:23.647]  Hey, but that's better, Matt, than hey, Snopes is going to have a fact check and say that's correct.
[01:25:23.647 --> 01:25:25.108]  Come on.
[01:25:25.108 --> 01:25:28.010]  Snopes.
[01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:33.895]  You know, and last week, Biden said or two weeks ago, he said, yeah, I just got my ass wiped.
[01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:34.876]  Snopes said he didn't say that.
[01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:35.296]  Doesn't matter.
[01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:36.437]  You saw him say it.
[01:25:36.437 --> 01:25:38.418]  Snopes is God.
[01:25:38.418 --> 01:25:39.800]  Snopes is king.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.261]  And again, remember.
[01:25:42.244 --> 01:25:49.969]  You get millions and millions of people that take these shots that aren't vaccines for the majority of the sick and dying, and that's being reported by the health services.
[01:25:49.969 --> 01:25:51.810]  But just disregard all that.
[01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:58.895]  It's the very... So again, that means the vaccine doesn't work, even if you buy their official crap.
[01:25:58.895 --> 01:26:02.377]  But oh, they got a booster for that, which they said a year ago they were going to have a booster.
[01:26:04.414 --> 01:26:10.339]  This has all been pre-programmed, so I should open the phones up ahead of Michael and Dell and my appellate joining us.
[01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:11.880]  You know, it's the big top thing on Twitter.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.101]  Everybody wants me to talk about it.
[01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.702]  Everybody wants to want to go there.
[01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:20.566]  Do people really want me to go into the babies held all over the world right now in facilities with their organs taken?
[01:26:20.566 --> 01:26:29.853]  Because they like to jack the prices up when they harvest those little guys.
[01:26:29.853 --> 01:26:33.136]  So they keep my wife sometimes a month, usually about a week.
[01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:37.720]  They tell Mommy, okay, baby, gone.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.063]  Take him to a special ward.
[01:26:40.063 --> 01:26:42.385]  Send him to special nurses.
[01:26:42.385 --> 01:26:45.789]  And those nurses can make an extra hundred grand a year, the special nurses.
[01:26:47.432 --> 01:26:53.674]  They sent all the non-disclosures, everything else, because all it would take would be one video showing the little babies in there being harvested.
[01:26:53.674 --> 01:26:55.995]  Viable, born baby, and it'd all be over.
[01:26:55.995 --> 01:26:57.316]  Healthy babies.
[01:26:57.316 --> 01:26:59.456]  But see, that's why evil's moving.
[01:26:59.456 --> 01:27:05.939]  It's like, man, we've got people running facilities all over the country and the world, keeping babies alive and murdering them for their organs.
[01:27:06.559 --> 01:27:12.121]  You don't want to kill them right when the mom has a car wreck that's eight months old.
[01:27:12.121 --> 01:27:15.242]  Oh, ma'am, you lost your baby.
[01:27:15.242 --> 01:27:17.642]  Or, oh, this woman's on drugs.
[01:27:17.642 --> 01:27:20.143]  We're going to take your baby, but your baby's sick.
[01:27:20.143 --> 01:27:22.864]  We're going to not resuscitate the pregnancy.
[01:27:22.864 --> 01:27:23.924]  Sign this form.
[01:27:23.924 --> 01:27:26.805]  Or, oh, your baby, your baby, you know.
[01:27:26.805 --> 01:27:29.246]  Oh, you're coming in for a nine-month abortion.
[01:27:29.246 --> 01:27:29.766]  Yeah, come on in.
[01:27:33.746 --> 01:27:35.607]  And that's what this all is, is the medical tyranny.
[01:27:35.607 --> 01:27:37.108]  Just all of us clapping at each other.
[01:27:37.108 --> 01:27:38.269]  Oh, murder me, murder me!
[01:27:38.269 --> 01:27:39.490]  Yes, let me ignore the facts.
[01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:41.712]  Let me be a mindless idiot.
[01:27:41.712 --> 01:27:44.454]  Marching to your death.
[01:27:44.454 --> 01:27:50.819]  All led by a bunch of domesticated chicken-neck men and a bunch of women.
[01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:52.740]  But all the corporations patting them on the head.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.041]  Here's your lollipop!
[01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:55.902]  You get your surprise, your gold star!
[01:27:55.902 --> 01:27:56.843]  You did good!
[01:27:56.843 --> 01:27:58.544]  Good, good, good, good, good!
[01:27:58.544 --> 01:27:59.165]  Good for you!
[01:28:02.113 --> 01:28:05.594]  You're like, why would Governor Northam go on TV and admit they keep babies alive?
[01:28:05.594 --> 01:28:10.074]  I mean, I had it in all the literature, I had it in all the documents, because he had to normalize it in front of medical workers.
[01:28:10.074 --> 01:28:15.975]  Like, can we take the baby and keep it comfortable and then get the organs and, you know?
[01:28:15.975 --> 01:28:18.296]  Because you've got to normalize something like that.
[01:28:18.296 --> 01:28:21.216]  You can't just, it's kind of like, well, of course pedophilia is good.
[01:28:21.216 --> 01:28:24.237]  I mean, of course we're going to teach your three-year-old how to have anal sex.
[01:28:24.237 --> 01:28:26.177]  I mean, you know, that's all over the news now.
[01:28:26.177 --> 01:28:30.058]  I mean, Steve Jobs' ex-wife is going to teach us how.
[01:28:30.058 --> 01:28:30.658]  She's a good lady.
[01:28:33.556 --> 01:28:35.597]  So, I mean, that's who they are.
[01:28:35.597 --> 01:28:37.218]  That's what they do.
[01:28:37.218 --> 01:28:42.041]  And we're animals to them, and we put up with them, and we don't stand up for ourselves, so we are!
[01:28:42.041 --> 01:28:44.783]  Lower than animals!
[01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:48.625]  Now, there might get some traction with Fauci giving dogs maggots and letting them eat them alive.
[01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:50.987]  Now, he might go to jail for that.
[01:28:50.987 --> 01:28:54.429]  You're implanting beagles with maggots so they can be eaten alive?
[01:28:55.529 --> 01:28:57.250]  Because he sees that as an art form.
[01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.210]  He likes to watch that.
[01:29:16.536 --> 01:29:24.799]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[01:29:24.799 --> 01:29:33.923]  But did you know that there's been times in the past, during times of extreme hardship, when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[01:29:33.923 --> 01:29:34.623]  It's true.
[01:29:34.623 --> 01:29:41.366]  Open-pollinated seeds have been, and could very well be, the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead.

[01:30:01.792 --> 01:30:07.155]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:30:07.155 --> 01:30:24.524]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:30:24.524 --> 01:30:28.146]  Worse than slaves, they're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:30:29.321 --> 01:30:36.866]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:30:36.866 --> 01:30:39.988]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world.
[01:30:39.988 --> 01:30:46.892]  We have to realize it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:30:46.892 --> 01:30:48.113]  It's that choice.
[01:30:48.113 --> 01:30:51.075]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:30:51.075 --> 01:30:53.256]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:30:53.256 --> 01:30:54.057]  Freedom or slavery.
[01:30:54.057 --> 01:30:55.518]  Good or evil.
[01:30:55.518 --> 01:30:56.859]  It is a spiritual battle.
[01:30:56.859 --> 01:30:58.500]  And M4 is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:30:59.611 --> 01:31:04.955]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[01:31:04.955 --> 01:31:09.819]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[01:31:09.819 --> 01:31:14.903]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:17.585]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[01:31:17.585 --> 01:31:20.907]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:31:20.907 --> 01:31:22.128]  You've got red blood.
[01:31:22.128 --> 01:31:29.054]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[01:31:29.634 --> 01:31:32.576]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:31:32.576 --> 01:31:36.439]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:31:36.439 --> 01:31:39.360]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.964]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:31:44.964 --> 01:31:46.865]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:31:46.865 --> 01:31:51.268]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:31:51.268 --> 01:31:55.371]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:31:55.371 --> 01:31:58.333]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoWars.
[01:31:58.333 --> 01:31:58.713]  God bless.
[01:31:59.813 --> 01:32:06.240]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:13.629]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:19.996]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[01:32:20.476 --> 01:32:23.660]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.384]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[01:32:26.384 --> 01:32:29.988]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[01:32:29.988 --> 01:32:32.531]  Also described as the seat of the soul.
[01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:36.196]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness.
[01:32:36.776 --> 01:32:38.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:11.069 --> 01:33:11.271]  Yeah.
[01:33:58.792 --> 01:34:01.413]  Sorry, it took me 45 seconds to get back in the chair here.
[01:34:01.413 --> 01:34:03.434]  My headset had gone out.
[01:34:03.434 --> 01:34:05.174]  That's what feeds me the audio back.
[01:34:05.174 --> 01:34:13.317]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here.
[01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:15.057]  Again, I don't do this for dramatic effect.
[01:34:15.057 --> 01:34:17.838]  I'm really having trouble even doing this show.
[01:34:17.838 --> 01:34:20.079]  And that's a paradox.
[01:34:20.079 --> 01:34:25.681]  It's like, this stuff's so horrible that sitting around and talking about it almost is like we're part of it.
[01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:29.483]  I mean, they knew these vaccines weren't vaccines.
[01:34:29.483 --> 01:34:33.426]  They knew it was going to make people's bodies attack themselves and their lungs and hearts and brains.
[01:34:33.426 --> 01:34:34.888]  They knew it was going to attack the ovaries.
[01:34:34.888 --> 01:34:36.789]  They had all the damn studies.
[01:34:36.789 --> 01:34:44.716]  Trying to create a vaccine for the cold, which is what this is, is been the holy grail.
[01:34:44.716 --> 01:34:46.317]  And it's well known.
[01:34:46.317 --> 01:34:51.041]  I mean, this is like very tried and true, very known what they did.
[01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:55.024]  So why would they pick an attack on everybody that's well known?
[01:34:55.024 --> 01:34:56.185]  They just have no respect for us.
[01:34:58.362 --> 01:35:11.451]  And so I'm trying to wrap my mind around this, this whole normalization process, and then I'm suddenly seeing articles all over the news about Kathy Griffin, the one that said killed Trump and all that.
[01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:16.994]  Oh, she's got lung cancer, never smoked in her life, she doesn't know what's happening.
[01:35:16.994 --> 01:35:22.658]  Well, I mean, you live in Los Angeles, it's a big giant mountain bowl of 10 million people, and it's super toxic.
[01:35:22.658 --> 01:35:23.839]  I feel sick anytime I'm there.
[01:35:23.839 --> 01:35:26.140]  I mean, you know, that's one thing for you.
[01:35:28.035 --> 01:35:33.042]  But she said, also, I'm fully vaccinated.
[01:35:33.042 --> 01:35:34.864]  She added that with her little cancer deal.
[01:35:34.864 --> 01:35:36.566]  Well, you know, will you guys give me the folder?
[01:35:36.566 --> 01:35:38.729]  Here it is, actually.
[01:35:38.729 --> 01:35:40.712]  This is just a small folder right here.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:52.427]  Of all the admissions of people getting cancer after the shot, they say, oh, that's normal in your uterus or your breast or your lymph nodes or other organs, like your lungs, to grow tumors.
[01:35:52.427 --> 01:35:55.509]  Just tell the doctors, don't worry about it for six months.
[01:35:55.509 --> 01:35:57.670]  That's actually the CDC recommendation.
[01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:05.976]  Not, is it malignant, is it benign, which would be science, just, oh, you notice that tumor grew in about two weeks?
[01:36:05.976 --> 01:36:07.917]  Well, just don't worry about that tumor, sweetheart.
[01:36:09.244 --> 01:36:17.326]  But then the doctors don't, they cut out your uterus, they cut out your lung, they cut out your lymph nodes, they cut out your... cut off your testicles.
[01:36:17.326 --> 01:36:20.967]  They cut off your breasts.
[01:36:20.967 --> 01:36:25.108]  Oh, it may cause cancer false alarms, says ABC News.
[01:36:25.108 --> 01:36:30.430]  Well, then I guess Kathy Griffin's gonna be just fine.
[01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:33.771]  And now, Andrew Dice Clay,
[01:36:35.011 --> 01:36:39.655]  Dealing with valve palsy by continuing to perform untouchable.
[01:36:39.655 --> 01:36:44.258]  And have we looked it up?
[01:36:44.258 --> 01:36:46.740]  Can we search Andrew Dice Clay?
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:47.761]  Has he genuflected?
[01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:49.182]  Has he told us that he took the shot?
[01:36:50.486 --> 01:36:55.151]  Because, you know, Bell's palsy is one of the main things the, quote, COVID shot causes, that and Guillain-Barre.
[01:36:55.151 --> 01:36:57.213]  I mean, they admit it does that.
[01:36:57.213 --> 01:37:11.448]  But if you try to talk about it like evil Dr. Mercola, they come to your house, they come to your business, they threaten you like, I saw the CNN piece, they go, he puts out disinfo that vitamin D and zinc and C are good to stop viral infections.
[01:37:11.448 --> 01:37:12.610]  Hell, you just die without them.
[01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:17.860]  And he puts out the disinfo that vaccines can be dangerous.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:25.988]  Wow, that's why they got a multi-billion dollar fund they pay out every year?
[01:37:25.988 --> 01:37:27.449]  Dr. Mercola!
[01:37:27.449 --> 01:37:32.214]  And then, I love how they pick a guy like him who's very introverted.
[01:37:32.214 --> 01:37:36.798]  Great guy for his age, incredible shape, you know, runs marathons, you name it.
[01:37:36.798 --> 01:37:38.780]  Knows exactly what he's talking about.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:39.481]  Very moral guy.
[01:37:41.428 --> 01:37:47.129]  But they knew he's an introvert and already said no to interviews, so he'll run away so they can act like, oh, he's scared.
[01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:49.250]  You don't see CNN ambushing me, do you?
[01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:50.970]  No, they're scared of me.
[01:37:50.970 --> 01:37:52.351]  I'll talk to CNN.
[01:37:52.351 --> 01:37:56.432]  Here, get your ugly asses out here right now, CNN, let's go.
[01:37:56.432 --> 01:37:59.593]  But I'm gonna videotape what you do so you can't edit it out of context.
[01:37:59.593 --> 01:38:03.774]  Oh, no, you don't come after me, you little slime bags.
[01:38:03.774 --> 01:38:08.375]  And let me tell you something, CNN, I don't get happy about this, which is how the universe works.
[01:38:09.943 --> 01:38:12.584]  You're all going to get cancer and so are your kids.
[01:38:12.584 --> 01:38:16.544]  I mean, the level of suicide and death and failure by evil people.
[01:38:16.544 --> 01:38:24.906]  I mean, when you get God out of your life, the evil energy just takes you over and kills you.
[01:38:24.906 --> 01:38:25.727]  I mean, look at Mercola.
[01:38:25.727 --> 01:38:31.488]  He looks like, he's like 30 years old and a football player and the guy's old.
[01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:35.509]  And then, and I'm certainly, I've heard it myself, but life force wise, I'm very strong.
[01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:36.409]  But just look at him on the bike.
[01:38:37.409 --> 01:38:45.374]  And then show the CNN skexy wraith chasing him around.
[01:38:45.374 --> 01:38:47.956]  Now he knew they were going to edit it and take it out of context.
[01:38:47.956 --> 01:38:50.778]  He didn't have a camera on him, so that's why he wisely went.
[01:38:50.778 --> 01:38:52.039]  I'm not saying he's bad for leaving.
[01:38:52.039 --> 01:38:56.442]  In fact, if I was riding around on a bicycle and they came up, I'd probably leave too because I didn't have a crew there.
[01:38:56.442 --> 01:39:00.665]  But I'm telling CNN, you want to come to Papa just like Piers Morgan did?
[01:39:00.665 --> 01:39:01.005]  Let's go.
[01:39:03.556 --> 01:39:05.657]  Oh, the doctor's a super spreader.
[01:39:05.657 --> 01:39:10.418]  Not only is the virus bad, but oh, information's a virus.
[01:39:10.418 --> 01:39:12.298]  Yeah, that's what CNN calls me, is a virus.
[01:39:12.298 --> 01:39:17.219]  Of course, what's Mercola know?
[01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:17.820]  He says, what do you do?
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.680]  You go out and get sun.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:20.580]  You're like a plant.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.440]  You gotta have it to live.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.081]  Is he stupid?
[01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:23.661]  No.
[01:39:23.661 --> 01:39:25.541]  Who lives the longest in the world?
[01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:31.443]  People in Italy and people in Japan that are farmers who culturally till the fields and work the fields with their shirts off.
[01:39:32.349 --> 01:39:36.690]  That's why in Japan, the ruling class wraps themselves in all that.
[01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:42.711]  That's how it started in the Muslim world, or before that, the Arabic world, because royalty had to have real white skin.
[01:39:42.711 --> 01:39:46.092]  Those that had red skin or brown skin were associated with the lower classes.
[01:39:46.092 --> 01:39:48.252]  That's what Schwarzenegger means.
[01:39:48.252 --> 01:39:51.253]  Black farmer.
[01:39:51.253 --> 01:39:57.774]  Not because Arnold Schwarzenegger comes from black people, but in the old German,
[01:39:59.870 --> 01:40:02.954]  In that old Visigoth, you know, type language.
[01:40:02.954 --> 01:40:06.198]  That's what they called the lower classes, was the black people.
[01:40:06.198 --> 01:40:08.140]  And the higher classes, the white people.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:12.265]  Because the kings didn't go out and patrol the fields.
[01:40:12.265 --> 01:40:13.887]  Well, I want to be black.
[01:40:13.887 --> 01:40:15.148]  And I don't mean copy Africans.
[01:40:15.148 --> 01:40:16.370]  I got red skin, baby.
[01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:17.591]  I need this time.
[01:40:17.591 --> 01:40:18.552]  I get depressed without it.
[01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:22.336]  I get jealous looking at Mercola all baked in that Florida sun.
[01:40:22.336 --> 01:40:22.937]  Give it to me.
[01:40:22.937 --> 01:40:23.477]  Give it to me.
[01:40:23.477 --> 01:40:24.258]  Give it to me.
[01:40:24.258 --> 01:40:25.980]  And I'm not bashing white people that can't tan.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:29.283]  And I've got a daughter that's got porcelain, beautiful skin.
[01:40:29.283 --> 01:40:30.484]  She can't tan.
[01:40:30.484 --> 01:40:32.106]  Tell them my son can't tan.
[01:40:32.106 --> 01:40:33.908]  So nothing against folks that can't tan.
[01:40:33.908 --> 01:40:37.672]  I'm just telling you that that's what you need, baby.
[01:40:37.672 --> 01:40:38.633]  Look at him, almost 70 years old.
[01:40:40.677 --> 01:40:45.379]  Look what he looks like, he's a frickin' football player in college.
[01:40:45.379 --> 01:40:56.843]  And then look at this idiot running along behind him like, like, like, like he's done something wrong and he's the bad guy.
[01:40:56.843 --> 01:41:03.545]  Meanwhile, I got this whole stack here, people.
[01:41:03.545 --> 01:41:07.707]  Going in after the shot, cancers grow within weeks and they cut them out because they're malignant.
[01:41:13.206 --> 01:41:16.189]  And it goes on and on and on, and they want to shut us down.
[01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.649]  But you know what?
[01:41:16.649 --> 01:41:17.510]  You haven't shut us down.
[01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:20.233]  That's why I love these listeners.
[01:41:20.233 --> 01:41:23.195]  That's why I appreciate these listeners, because this is a serious war.
[01:41:23.195 --> 01:41:26.839]  And we knew.
[01:41:26.839 --> 01:41:27.239]  We knew.
[01:41:27.239 --> 01:41:29.241]  I mean, I said it.
[01:41:29.241 --> 01:41:30.782]  Chris Sky said it from the documents.
[01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:34.165]  Anybody who looks at these as smart can tell you.
[01:41:34.165 --> 01:41:37.468]  We said by the fall, there'll be a new lockdown this year, last year.
[01:41:38.462 --> 01:41:43.343]  And it'll be worse this time because these vaccines shed the literature, the studies show.
[01:41:43.343 --> 01:41:58.726]  I mean, they had to pass a law in the EU last year before they approved these vaccines saying you can viral shed from an mRNA shot and that people can infect others and have no liability.
[01:41:58.726 --> 01:42:01.927]  They're not just giving the vaccine makers liability now protection.
[01:42:01.927 --> 01:42:04.128]  They're doing it for shedding.
[01:42:04.128 --> 01:42:05.348]  What's that tell you?
[01:42:08.493 --> 01:42:11.275]  And that's why Biden said you're going to have more restrictions, more guidelines.
[01:42:11.275 --> 01:42:17.038]  They've already got them written up, but they're getting all the stores and the shops.
[01:42:17.038 --> 01:42:22.321]  One of my crew members tried to go to Popeye's Chicken yesterday and go in, it's already shut down in Austin.
[01:42:22.321 --> 01:42:25.662]  Because the health department said so outside of law.
[01:42:25.662 --> 01:42:27.944]  And their answer?
[01:42:27.944 --> 01:42:31.466]  You're going to stay shut in until you take our new shot.
[01:42:31.466 --> 01:42:33.527]  When almost everyone's sick, 95% in Israel.
[01:42:37.798 --> 01:42:40.701]  99.99999% in Australia.
[01:42:40.701 --> 01:42:45.425]  The vaccine is the plague, but people can't admit they're being assaulted.
[01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.867]  They can't admit they're being attacked.
[01:42:46.867 --> 01:42:52.953]  They can't believe that Bill Gates wants to hurt them, even though Bill Gates says, I want to kill you.
[01:42:52.953 --> 01:42:54.434]  I want to kill you.
[01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:55.676]  I want to kill you.
[01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:56.537]  Now take my shot.
[01:42:58.655 --> 01:43:04.180]  It was our number two best selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed the supply chain.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:08.224]  And it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:11.087]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[01:43:11.087 --> 01:43:12.228]  That's why this one's white.
[01:43:12.228 --> 01:43:14.290]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[01:43:14.290 --> 01:43:14.570]  Get it.

[01:43:59.824 --> 01:44:06.610]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:10.173]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[01:44:10.173 --> 01:44:11.334]  Even more the general public.
[01:44:11.334 --> 01:44:13.696]  They do the same things over and over again.
[01:44:13.696 --> 01:44:18.160]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[01:44:19.298 --> 01:44:20.139]  Well guess what?
[01:44:20.139 --> 01:44:34.140]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[01:44:35.342 --> 01:44:40.827]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[01:44:40.827 --> 01:44:47.192]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[01:44:47.192 --> 01:44:56.500]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.561]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:59.909 --> 01:45:06.477]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[01:45:06.477 --> 01:45:08.420]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.861]  Thank you for praying for us.
[01:45:09.861 --> 01:45:10.963]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[01:45:12.173 --> 01:45:22.598]  If all of you will simply go to Infowarsstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[01:45:22.598 --> 01:45:28.561]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[01:45:28.561 --> 01:45:40.727]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil, and in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[01:45:41.007 --> 01:45:43.489]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.

[01:46:00.512 --> 01:46:06.597]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[01:46:06.597 --> 01:46:14.103]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:46:14.103 --> 01:46:16.405]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:46:16.405 --> 01:46:19.908]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:46:21.909 --> 01:46:30.074]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[01:46:30.074 --> 01:46:35.978]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[01:46:35.978 --> 01:46:46.705]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[01:46:46.705 --> 01:46:47.906]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:46:48.746 --> 01:47:02.091]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[01:47:02.091 --> 01:47:10.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.934 --> 01:47:13.795]  While you were sleeping
[01:47:18.402 --> 01:47:33.827]  All right, Mike Lindell, embattled, a true American.
[01:47:33.827 --> 01:47:38.729]  He's going to be joining us coming up at 6 after next hour.
[01:47:38.729 --> 01:47:41.270]  Let me show you again some more of these critical reports.
[01:47:42.932 --> 01:47:46.556]  That are beyond critical to expose this criminal takeover.
[01:47:46.556 --> 01:47:48.278]  That are coffin nails to the fraud.
[01:47:48.278 --> 01:47:53.504]  Hey, did you know 95% of the hospitalizations in Israel are people vaccinated?
[01:47:53.504 --> 01:47:58.669]  Hey, did you know 99.9% of people hospitalized in Australia are injected?
[01:47:58.669 --> 01:48:02.153]  That's not a Delta variant.
[01:48:02.153 --> 01:48:03.455]  That's what they were injected with.
[01:48:05.282 --> 01:48:07.822]  Means you don't have those numbers of those that weren't injected.
[01:48:07.822 --> 01:48:16.904]  Israel, Australia report 90 to 99% hospitalized, fully vaccinated, big article, InfoWars.com.
[01:48:16.904 --> 01:48:20.785]  Get it, change the headline, do whatever you want, put your name on it, I don't care.
[01:48:20.785 --> 01:48:25.306]  Just get it out.
[01:48:25.306 --> 01:48:29.547]  Meanwhile, knowingly exposing others to HIV is no longer a felony in California.
[01:48:29.547 --> 01:48:31.227]  They changed that four years ago.
[01:48:33.456 --> 01:48:37.760]  They've also basically legalized pedophilia, giving kids inoculations down to age 12 without parental consent.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.242]  It's all about raping innocents.
[01:48:41.242 --> 01:48:54.153]  You see, Germany and the EU passed a law this year allowing viral spread from vaccines because that's what these mRNA vaccines do is they make you become a factory of that.
[01:48:54.153 --> 01:48:56.955]  So that's what's going on.
[01:48:56.955 --> 01:48:57.756]  That's what's happening.
[01:48:57.756 --> 01:49:01.940]  And here is the White House on August 2nd.
[01:49:04.022 --> 01:49:12.247]  Biden health official says it's time to impose requirements, that's mandates, to get vaccinated against COVID-19 with Fauci and the head of the CDC looking on.
[01:49:12.247 --> 01:49:20.733]  They had their minion do it and announce the crime, the Nuremberg Code violating crime, and now they're getting ready to do lockdown too.
[01:49:22.961 --> 01:49:29.363]  Because they've got to act like there's an emergency going on, because there is, because there's all these people sick and dying who've taken the vaccine.
[01:49:29.363 --> 01:49:35.444]  And then those getting sick and dying now that are getting the virus protein sloughed off onto them.
[01:49:35.444 --> 01:49:40.265]  They admit.
[01:49:40.265 --> 01:49:42.666]  And what type of people would do this?
[01:49:42.666 --> 01:49:46.346]  Well, the type of people that have thousands of studies going in the U.S.
[01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:46.707]  alone.
[01:49:46.707 --> 01:49:48.307]  God, China, they say, is even more horrific.
[01:49:50.188 --> 01:49:55.251]  With beagle puppies, where they implant them with flesh-eating screwworms.
[01:49:55.251 --> 01:50:02.536]  See, the average maggot, the average larva of a fly doesn't eat live meat, but screwworms do.
[01:50:02.536 --> 01:50:07.580]  And they've got a lot of varieties of screwworms that were eradicated in the U.S., but Fauci wants to bring screwworms back.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:12.083]  By the way, this isn't satire, this isn't me writing a Clive Barker Hellraisers prequel.
[01:50:14.008 --> 01:50:19.571]  This is, this is, this is, on Fauci's screensaver, I'm serious, he punches up laboratories.
[01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:21.553]  I've been around these guys, not him, but others.
[01:50:21.553 --> 01:50:24.034]  Like, oh, there's the monkey lab, there's the dog lab.
[01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:28.617]  They enjoy watching a dog with maggots implanted throughout his body dying.
[01:50:28.617 --> 01:50:29.818]  Like I told you, the VA got caught.
[01:50:29.818 --> 01:50:31.399]  By the way, this is not a joke for your listener.
[01:50:31.399 --> 01:50:34.781]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:50:34.781 --> 01:50:43.166]  Fauci implanted beagle puppies with pleasure with maggots to eat their bodies and then finally kill them.
[01:50:43.166 --> 01:50:43.346]  Now,
[01:50:45.342 --> 01:50:54.746]  Nobody cares about humans, but he of course scalped babies alive and put their skin onto rats, but that was just part of what he did.
[01:50:54.746 --> 01:50:58.607]  That's all come out too, but he's the good man that works for Bill Gates.
[01:50:58.607 --> 01:50:59.788]  He's the good man that did the
[01:51:01.075 --> 01:51:09.577]  Inoculation program for different supposed pathogens in the New York gay community in the late 1970s where HIV popped up.
[01:51:09.577 --> 01:51:16.418]  He's a nice, nice man like Ghislaine Maxwell and Steve Jobs, running all this.
[01:51:16.418 --> 01:51:22.219]  Continuing, Alex Jones was right, goes viral on Twitter for exposing fetal organ harvesting.
[01:51:22.219 --> 01:51:24.079]  And I mentioned this, but let me just go over it.
[01:51:24.079 --> 01:51:29.260]  I appreciate Jack Posobiec, when a bunch of documents came out confirming this is going on at major universities.
[01:51:31.621 --> 01:51:37.466]  And that they are keeping babies alive sometimes for weeks so they can auction off their livers and kidneys.
[01:51:37.466 --> 01:51:41.329]  See, these organs only live a few hours maximum.
[01:51:42.745 --> 01:51:54.327]  If they're not hooked to the blood supply, but if you can keep the baby alive when it's in the third trimester, post-birth abortion, and then violate federal law, because you're supposed to kill it inside the womb, well, then you can do that.
[01:51:54.327 --> 01:51:59.588]  But the university's bragging here how they were delivered whole babies, hearts still beating.
[01:51:59.588 --> 01:52:01.248]  In fact, I don't have a way with words, do I?
[01:52:01.248 --> 01:52:02.709]  I should have just said up front.
[01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:09.550]  Government documents four-year confirms Fauci programs, Fauci-driven run programs, many of which he has his name on,
[01:52:10.458 --> 01:52:15.022]  Didn't just scalp babies and put their hair on rats and mice.
[01:52:15.022 --> 01:52:20.167]  No, no, it's more liberal, more loving than that.
[01:52:20.167 --> 01:52:26.193]  They delivered whole babies, hearts beating, to the universities.
[01:52:27.387 --> 01:52:29.969]  And I'll just tell you, we know what they do.
[01:52:29.969 --> 01:52:32.211]  They also wreck the babies.
[01:52:32.211 --> 01:52:33.232]  And I'm sorry I have to tell you that.
[01:52:33.232 --> 01:52:35.575]  They also have sex with the dead babies, okay?
[01:52:35.575 --> 01:52:38.617]  That came out, because they're still living, sorry, they have sex with them before they kill them.
[01:52:38.617 --> 01:52:39.798]  That's a religion to them.
[01:52:39.798 --> 01:52:47.005]  That came out, I told you this 20 years ago, it came out in documents in Texas and in Missouri and other areas, where they do rituals and have sex with the babies.
[01:52:47.005 --> 01:52:49.047]  They go, oh, ma'am, your baby's been aborted.
[01:52:49.047 --> 01:52:53.010]  And the doctor goes and has sex with it, with the nurses behind the scenes, they rub blood all over each other.
[01:52:54.091 --> 01:52:56.853]  I mean, why would you want to be in a place that killed nine-month-old babies?
[01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:59.754]  Because you want to have sex with them.
[01:52:59.754 --> 01:53:06.197]  Now remember, you're a new viewer, you're tuning in, you're like, see, there's a lot of stuff I haven't told you yet, but let's just start telling you everything.
[01:53:06.197 --> 01:53:11.760]  These are people that want to have sex with living babies before they kill them.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.083]  And then after they're done raping the baby, and it screams and cries, then they go and
[01:53:17.219 --> 01:53:34.063]  Take its heart, first the liver, the kidneys, all the different organs, and then they take the heart, and then they suck all the blood out, and then they take all the fat and all the tissue and all the bones and they sell every bit of it in a ritual of hate and greed and pure Satanism.
[01:53:34.063 --> 01:53:37.784]  And that's who Fauci is when he's not implanting baby dogs with maggots.
[01:53:38.744 --> 01:53:51.107]  They are taking babies and scalping them and implanting it on rats and his little vampire servants are in there hunched over the babies while they cry for mommy raping them.
[01:53:51.107 --> 01:53:52.788]  So there you go.
[01:53:52.788 --> 01:53:57.269]  Now you wonder why they'd put protein crystals and vaccines to kill you and your family.
[01:53:57.269 --> 01:54:02.150]  Because they're Satan worshippers that have gone to the ends of the universe.
[01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:07.212]  They've gone straight to hell, down a black hole, and anything you can imagine they do.
[01:54:07.212 --> 01:54:07.652]  And that's it.
[01:54:09.551 --> 01:54:15.433]  From implanting maggots in dogs to eat them alive so Fauci can watch it on his screen.
[01:54:15.433 --> 01:54:21.354]  He just loves knowing those dogs are in pain, itching, and bleeding with maggots eating your flesh, gobbling them whole.
[01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:24.235]  He loves knowing they keep those babies alive and take those organs.
[01:54:24.235 --> 01:54:29.056]  And he loves knowing he's implanted you with that deadly prion crystal, and now it's spreading to everyone else.
[01:54:29.056 --> 01:54:30.617]  And he's gonna murder you.
[01:54:30.617 --> 01:54:32.097]  He's got power over you.
[01:54:32.097 --> 01:54:34.358]  He's been given power by Satan over you.
[01:54:34.358 --> 01:54:37.599]  And he is a servant of Satan who is so proud of what he's doing.
[01:54:37.599 --> 01:54:38.699]  And he's gonna get your children.
[01:54:41.084 --> 01:54:46.389]  You can look it up where they do satanic rituals with the baby's bodies.
[01:54:46.389 --> 01:54:47.570]  But that's just child's play.
[01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:48.991]  That's low-level stuff for Fauci.
[01:54:48.991 --> 01:54:52.355]  He likes to kill hundreds of millions of billions.
[01:54:52.355 --> 01:55:00.783]  But his minions, they, you know, they get to, you know, it's like when Count Dracula gives the baby to his women.
[01:55:00.783 --> 01:55:02.584]  Oh, you go have fun with this little baby here.
[01:55:02.584 --> 01:55:04.226]  They're like, oh, thank you.
[01:55:04.226 --> 01:55:06.128]  That's all just little examples.
[01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:11.911]  Of what they do and how they operate and what they've got planned for you and your family.
[01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:12.952]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:55:12.952 --> 01:55:14.932]  There's Fauci.
[01:55:14.932 --> 01:55:16.873]  Thought you might want to know what he's up to today.
[01:55:16.873 --> 01:55:20.994]  And by the way, everything but the raping babies is documented on record.
[01:55:20.994 --> 01:55:25.596]  The maggots in the dogs, keeping babies alive, taking their organs, which is all just as evil as having sex with them.
[01:55:25.596 --> 01:55:29.797]  But you have to understand, the Satanists like to have sex in churches at night.
[01:55:29.797 --> 01:55:31.778]  That's called a blasphemy.
[01:55:31.778 --> 01:55:33.539]  That's the high holy thing they do.
[01:55:33.539 --> 01:55:37.060]  And they want to defile children.
[01:55:38.559 --> 01:55:43.801]  And the highest order is to rape a child that's Black Sabbath and then kill them.
[01:55:43.801 --> 01:55:47.802]  And so these people are carrying out Black Sabbath at an industrial level.
[01:55:47.802 --> 01:55:55.745]  The poor little kids grabbed out of Mexico and Latin America, they're being fed, they're being handed over, they're being tortured, they're being raped, they're being beaten, they're being enslaved.
[01:55:55.745 --> 01:56:04.427]  It's all an affront to God to drive God's spirit out of the land so they can have full power and kill everybody.
[01:56:04.427 --> 01:56:05.868]  So there you go, there's the rest of the story.
[01:56:06.977 --> 01:56:07.277]  I don't know.
[01:56:24.025 --> 01:56:27.446]  Of course, the zinc that's so essential.
[01:56:27.446 --> 01:56:31.348]  We have the best high-quality products at 50% off in a flash sale.
[01:56:31.348 --> 01:56:36.710]  We have X2, even though it's selling out, I'm still going 50% off through the weekend on X2, the Deep Earth Iodine Crystal.
[01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:40.411]  And the dropper bottle, even though it's very close to selling out, but more is coming in soon.
[01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:47.434]  And we also have all the other products at InfoWarstore.com that are only going to go for another day or so.
[01:56:47.434 --> 01:56:51.796]  And that is the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula and the 10-Hour Clean Energy Turbo Force.
[01:56:53.286 --> 01:56:56.589]  Those are only for sale for another 24 to 48 hours.
[01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:59.251]  Those are very, very close to selling out.
[01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:00.092]  I've got some good news.
[01:57:00.092 --> 01:57:02.154]  Vitamin Refusion is close to being back in.
[01:57:02.154 --> 01:57:03.735]  We also have the great SleepAids.
[01:57:03.735 --> 01:57:07.178]  We have both Knockout and then we have Down-N-Out that's even stronger.
[01:57:07.178 --> 01:57:08.320]  Two different formulas.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.902]  Look out if you're using the Down-N-Out because they're both powerful.
[01:57:10.902 --> 01:57:12.743]  And we have Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil.
[01:57:13.703 --> 01:57:16.064]  It's all on InfoWarscore.com.
[01:57:16.064 --> 01:57:17.625]  And I'm sorry to have to tell you all this stuff.
[01:57:17.625 --> 01:57:21.128]  I know it all sounds insane, it all sounds crazy, but it's all real.
[01:57:21.128 --> 01:57:29.613]  And just understand that these are people that have very, very demonic directions for us.
[01:57:31.032 --> 01:57:33.414]  They're just, their whole world is about our children.
[01:57:33.414 --> 01:57:36.977]  And I mean, I like to go to a restaurant and order a piece of veal because the meat tastes good.
[01:57:36.977 --> 01:57:39.159]  I kind of feel a little guilty, like this is a baby cow.
[01:57:39.159 --> 01:57:41.701]  These people don't want the flavor of the meat.
[01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:43.162]  They want the soul.
[01:57:43.162 --> 01:57:45.043]  They want to hear the baby screaming and crying.
[01:57:45.043 --> 01:57:46.505]  They want to affront God.
[01:57:48.584 --> 01:57:52.749]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[01:57:52.749 --> 01:57:56.853]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[01:57:56.853 --> 01:57:59.176]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[01:57:59.176 --> 01:58:03.961]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[01:58:03.961 --> 01:58:07.686]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[01:58:08.106 --> 01:58:16.618]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.

[01:58:50.302 --> 01:58:53.124]  The biosecurity state is here.
[01:58:53.124 --> 01:58:59.047]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[01:58:59.047 --> 01:59:12.814]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[01:59:14.255 --> 01:59:17.478]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[01:59:17.478 --> 01:59:21.482]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[01:59:21.482 --> 01:59:23.263]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:59:23.263 --> 01:59:25.365]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[01:59:25.365 --> 01:59:28.188]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[01:59:28.188 --> 01:59:31.050]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:40.339]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[01:59:41.279 --> 01:59:41.899]  We're good to go.
[02:00:11.314 --> 02:00:13.956]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:13.956 --> 02:00:19.119]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:27.723]  More evidence tonight that it's always the people you most suspect.
[02:00:27.723 --> 02:00:32.948]  Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, is every bit the creep you thought he was and more.
[02:00:32.948 --> 02:00:36.871]  He talks like a mafia leader and he acts like one.
[02:00:36.871 --> 02:00:41.654]  Eleven sexual harassment claims against him public today.
[02:00:41.654 --> 02:00:50.081]  If you're interested, go over to CNN right now and watch Jeffrey Toobin, of all people, talk about how creepy Governor Cuomo is.
[02:00:50.913 --> 02:00:52.534]  Because this country just couldn't get better.
[02:00:52.534 --> 02:00:56.297]  We're going to have a lot more on that in just a minute.
[02:00:56.297 --> 02:01:02.622]  But first tonight, welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight, coming to you from Budapest, Hungary.
[02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:12.670]  Last summer, as the COVID pandemic raged throughout the United States, people who still read the New York Times began to notice something very strange happening at the paper.
[02:01:12.670 --> 02:01:17.313]  Hundreds of articles that had appeared there going back nearly a decade suddenly vanished.
[02:01:17.313 --> 02:01:18.134]  They disappeared.
[02:01:18.134 --> 02:01:19.095]  There's no way to find them.
[02:01:19.855 --> 02:01:22.177]  Nothing like this had ever happened.
[02:01:22.177 --> 02:01:27.342]  The New York Times considers itself, very self-consciously, a living historical record.
[02:01:27.342 --> 02:01:33.887]  The paper maintains meticulous, searchable archives going back to before the Civil War, to 1851.
[02:01:33.887 --> 02:01:37.691]  Yet last August, a huge number of articles just disappeared.
[02:01:38.848 --> 02:01:40.729]  So what was in those articles?
[02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:46.551]  We know the answer because a handful of history-minded readers preserved them when they first appeared.
[02:01:46.551 --> 02:01:53.675]  Every one of them was a propaganda piece paid for by the Chinese Communist Party, all designed to look like news articles.
[02:01:53.675 --> 02:01:55.455]  You're seeing one of them on your screen right now.
[02:01:55.455 --> 02:01:57.316]  It reads, China Watch!
[02:01:57.316 --> 02:01:58.297]  D.O.U.
[02:01:58.297 --> 02:02:00.138]  islands belong to China!
[02:02:00.138 --> 02:02:00.838]  That's the headline.
[02:02:01.977 --> 02:02:10.831]  Now why would the New York Times, America's paper of record, print propaganda from a totalitarian regime and pretend it was a news article?
[02:02:11.752 --> 02:02:13.293]  Well, for money.
[02:02:13.293 --> 02:02:19.116]  Financial filings show the New York Times made more than $100,000 a month from this garbage.
[02:02:19.116 --> 02:02:20.777]  Those payments were not disclosed at the time.
[02:02:20.777 --> 02:02:22.778]  They were hidden from New York Times readers.
[02:02:22.778 --> 02:02:26.379]  They were only uncovered after the facts by the Washington Free Beacon.
[02:02:26.379 --> 02:02:32.002]  And the Times wasn't the only news organization that did this, that took money from the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:02:32.002 --> 02:02:38.606]  Since 2016, the Chinese Communist Party paid $20 million to outlets like the Los Angeles Times.
[02:02:39.266 --> 02:02:42.948]  The Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post.
[02:02:42.948 --> 02:02:51.333]  Twitter, which now operates as a publisher, also received checks from the Chinese government totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:02:51.333 --> 02:02:54.054]  Now these arrangements, as we said, continued for years.
[02:02:54.054 --> 02:02:56.856]  And then last summer, they stopped abruptly.
[02:02:56.856 --> 02:03:00.838]  The New York Times tried to hide the evidence that any of it ever happened.
[02:03:00.838 --> 02:03:01.419]  But why?
[02:03:02.332 --> 02:03:04.774]  The New York Times won't say when we ask.
[02:03:04.774 --> 02:03:10.598]  We do not discuss revenue beyond what is in our quarterly earnings report, a spokesman told us this morning.
[02:03:10.598 --> 02:03:12.299]  So we kept looking.
[02:03:12.299 --> 02:03:15.602]  But first, here's some context for what the New York Times did.
[02:03:15.602 --> 02:03:20.445]  This is what mainstream news coverage in the United States looked like for most of last year.
[02:03:20.445 --> 02:03:26.150]  As you watch it, see if you can tell the difference between this and what you might see on Chinese state television.
[02:03:27.079 --> 02:03:31.102]  The president referred to the coronavirus as a, quote, foreign virus.
[02:03:31.102 --> 02:03:36.807]  I think it's going to come across to a lot of Americans as spacking of xenophobia.
[02:03:36.807 --> 02:03:46.195]  Xenophobic wartime Trump, where he thinks the only path now is to basically declare the virus public enemy number one, to paint it in somewhat racist terms.
[02:03:46.195 --> 02:03:52.380]  The xenophobia and the racism in outbreak is such a common thing, and it is incredibly dangerous.
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:56.083]  It is problematic, and it is scary, and I just really want to call that out.
[02:03:56.263 --> 02:03:59.289]  Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?
[02:03:59.289 --> 02:04:00.531]  Why do you keep using this?
[02:04:00.531 --> 02:04:02.515]  A lot of people say it's racist.
[02:04:02.515 --> 02:04:04.078]  It's not racist at all, no.
[02:04:04.078 --> 02:04:04.820]  Not at all.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:06.844]  It comes from China.
[02:04:06.844 --> 02:04:07.244]  That's why.
[02:04:09.878 --> 02:04:22.465]  So as this virus emerged from central China to kill Americans in huge numbers and people throughout the West, news organizations in this country made the same aggressively pro-China noises.
[02:04:22.465 --> 02:04:23.745]  Almost all of them.
[02:04:23.745 --> 02:04:32.510]  Politico, for example, hired a full-time China shill called David Wartime to write articles with headlines like this, quote, The verdict is in.
[02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:38.193]  China has outperformed while the once respected American system has disastrously faltered.
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:45.325]  Now, as you read that, once again, you wonder, how is that different from what the Chinese would write about themselves?
[02:04:45.325 --> 02:04:46.827]  Well, it's not different.
[02:04:46.827 --> 02:04:51.091]  The American media were especially hysterical on the question of where the coronavirus came from.
[02:04:51.091 --> 02:04:55.715]  Alright, we'll be back with Mike Lindell, but yeah, the whole mainstream media is Chai Com.
[02:04:55.715 --> 02:04:56.195]  Remember that.
[02:05:00.205 --> 02:05:06.272]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:05:06.272 --> 02:05:13.780]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.102]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:05:16.102 --> 02:05:19.686]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[02:05:21.588 --> 02:05:29.752]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[02:05:29.752 --> 02:05:35.655]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[02:05:35.655 --> 02:05:46.401]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[02:05:46.401 --> 02:05:47.582]  Thank you and God bless.
[02:05:48.442 --> 02:05:54.074]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[02:06:37.776 --> 02:06:41.757]  Well, he's definitely a rider on the storm.
[02:06:41.757 --> 02:06:43.217]  Mike Lindell is a hero.
[02:06:43.217 --> 02:06:47.798]  He's standing up for our American Republic, for integrity in our election system.
[02:06:47.798 --> 02:06:57.860]  I could play you hours of videos from just a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, of Democrats saying they don't trust the very companies that Mike Lindell has brought out and talked about.
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:01.581]  We've played those clips, you've all seen them.
[02:07:01.581 --> 02:07:04.682]  And then he says things milder than that, and he gets sued.
[02:07:05.926 --> 02:07:09.389]  And that's because these organizations are scared of what's coming out.
[02:07:09.389 --> 02:07:16.234]  But I know at the retail level, what's come out in Georgia and Arizona, other states, with them sending the same ballots through over and over again.
[02:07:16.234 --> 02:07:17.775]  We caught that on tape.
[02:07:17.775 --> 02:07:18.916]  That's all coming out.
[02:07:18.916 --> 02:07:23.320]  And now the Justice Department, run by this puppet president, says they want us to try to stop
[02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.352]  Those audits and those findings.
[02:07:26.352 --> 02:07:29.815]  So that vindicates what Mike Lindell has done.
[02:07:29.815 --> 02:07:30.576]  He's been attacked.
[02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:31.517]  He's been demonized.
[02:07:31.517 --> 02:07:37.103]  He's got a big symposium coming up next week that's going to be sent out on his huge site.
[02:07:37.103 --> 02:07:39.725]  We'll be telling you the URL for it in a minute.
[02:07:39.725 --> 02:07:43.289]  Putting this evidence on, and boy is the system scared.
[02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:46.813]  Mike Lindell, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule at MyPillow.com.
[02:07:47.668 --> 02:07:51.690]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, and we're very busy.
[02:07:51.690 --> 02:07:55.533]  Not so much with MyPillow.com, but with this symposium.
[02:07:55.533 --> 02:08:01.416]  We are just a couple days away, and 10th, 11th, and 12th, you watch it, it's over.
[02:08:01.416 --> 02:08:10.001]  And you get anyone that doesn't believe that this election was stolen by China to watch it, and they're 100%.
[02:08:10.001 --> 02:08:13.443]  We're going to dump all the evidence the PAC had captured for the whole election.
[02:08:13.983 --> 02:08:19.206]  We've got over, Alex, we have over 75 now cyber forensic experts coming.
[02:08:19.206 --> 02:08:27.090]  We have over 300 politicians and there are delegates coming and it's
[02:08:28.214 --> 02:08:30.096]  It's going to be absolutely amazing.
[02:08:30.096 --> 02:08:33.779]  We just need everybody out there to get people to watch it.
[02:08:33.779 --> 02:08:34.139]  Absolutely.
[02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:37.842]  I'm going to be there for at least two of the days as well.
[02:08:37.842 --> 02:08:40.384]  Let's get into the panic mode there, Rand.
[02:08:40.384 --> 02:08:47.390]  I want to play a clip here and get your full context of CNN where they're trying to say, you've been conned, you've been manipulated.
[02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:49.672]  You say, hey, let me give you a hug.
[02:08:49.672 --> 02:08:54.636]  Here it is.
[02:08:54.636 --> 02:08:57.098]  You could possibly be the victim of a scam here.
[02:08:58.052 --> 02:09:01.556]  Well, then why don't you come to the symposium and make five million dollars?
[02:09:01.556 --> 02:09:02.437]  Are you worried about me?
[02:09:02.437 --> 02:09:03.679]  We should give a hug.
[02:09:03.679 --> 02:09:05.361]  You're worried about old Mike?
[02:09:05.361 --> 02:09:06.282]  Oh, God bless you!
[02:09:06.282 --> 02:09:13.691]  I love how you kill them with kindness, just like we've been on some of the other national comedy shows.
[02:09:13.691 --> 02:09:16.034]  Tell us more about that interview and how the media is attacking you.
[02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:19.672]  Well, that was a two and a half hour interview, everybody.
[02:09:19.672 --> 02:09:30.000]  There's a lady, they came, we did it in Minneapolis, and we had to go down, they were adamant they wanted me to come down there, they wouldn't come out here, and I said, you know what?
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.662]  Once again, it's like, Mike, why would you do that for CNN?
[02:09:33.502 --> 02:09:35.744]  Well, because where's Fox?
[02:09:35.744 --> 02:09:37.325]  Shame on Fox, right?
[02:09:37.325 --> 02:09:39.367]  So anyway, I go down there.
[02:09:39.367 --> 02:09:42.309]  Two and a half hours, there's someone holding a thing up behind me.
[02:09:42.309 --> 02:09:43.329]  Ask him this.
[02:09:43.329 --> 02:09:44.330]  Ask him this.
[02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:45.251]  Attack this.
[02:09:45.251 --> 02:09:46.752]  But we recorded the whole thing.
[02:09:46.752 --> 02:09:47.953]  I had two of my guys.
[02:09:47.953 --> 02:09:49.134]  We recorded the whole thing.
[02:09:49.855 --> 02:09:59.145]  And I'll tell you, they tried to, you know, they took, they combined things, tried to, like here, this data that I gave them.
[02:09:59.145 --> 02:10:03.770]  That was just a data from the 2020 election.
[02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:06.293]  And it's basically, here, come to the symposium.
[02:10:06.293 --> 02:10:09.677]  It's kind of like a preliminary, here you go, show them what you're going to see.
[02:10:10.457 --> 02:10:20.965]  And CNN, I mean, I'm going, why don't you guys come and get, you know, like I say, I've offered $5 million to anyone there that can prove it's not valid data from the 2020 November election.
[02:10:20.965 --> 02:10:23.586]  Instead, they try and do a hit job ahead of time.
[02:10:23.586 --> 02:10:28.730]  But once again, it sure got the word out because that's all we need, everybody.
[02:10:28.730 --> 02:10:30.451]  I have all the, I have it all.
[02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:31.412]  I have all the evidence.
[02:10:33.173 --> 02:10:41.817]  100% all the states, all 50 states, it's going to show what happened in not just the swing states, but every single state.
[02:10:41.817 --> 02:10:44.699]  We're going to have like, behind us, we'll have these five
[02:10:46.152 --> 02:10:51.134]  We're going to have like a table of five there, a podium, and it's going to be like election night, kind of.
[02:10:51.134 --> 02:11:01.419]  We're going to go back and forth to the mock election room, the cyber center, and then we'll be up front, hey, this just in, the state of New Hampshire goes to Donald Trump.
[02:11:01.419 --> 02:11:03.320]  And then, you know, we'll have this backed up.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.701]  By the way, the state of New Hampshire, remember, went for Biden, they say.
[02:11:06.701 --> 02:11:07.362]  No, it didn't.
[02:11:07.362 --> 02:11:08.162]  Donald Trump won.
[02:11:08.802 --> 02:11:10.683]  And so we're going to do all 50 states.
[02:11:10.683 --> 02:11:15.305]  We've got the cyber forensic experts that have looked at all this.
[02:11:15.305 --> 02:11:18.647]  They're going to speak, tell you here it is.
[02:11:18.647 --> 02:11:20.568]  This is 100% valid.
[02:11:20.568 --> 02:11:24.650]  And then we're going to break out all the cyber experts that have come from around the country.
[02:11:24.650 --> 02:11:30.053]  And remember, we even have lead stories, the factbook fake checkers that
[02:11:30.693 --> 02:11:31.214]  We're good.
[02:11:46.648 --> 02:11:48.069]  And it's going to be amazing.
[02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:59.016]  By the time this is done, by the time it gets to our closing, because we're going to go 72 hours, it goes 9 to 9, we're going to live stream it at frankspeech.com continually.
[02:11:59.016 --> 02:12:03.899]  At 9 to 9, we're going to flip it on its head because everyone overseas wants to see this too.
[02:12:03.899 --> 02:12:06.661]  By the way, we're going to have a speaker from another country.
[02:12:06.661 --> 02:12:08.061]  I'm going to surprise you.
[02:12:08.061 --> 02:12:09.883]  Very high up in government.
[02:12:09.883 --> 02:12:11.423]  Really high up.
[02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:13.465]  Because all the other countries are worried too.
[02:12:14.025 --> 02:12:17.529]  The ones that have these machines and they're trying to take over this.
[02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:20.591]  And so it's going to be this.
[02:12:20.591 --> 02:12:26.457]  It's all come down to this, just like that commercial says that that Fox was the only one that didn't run it.
[02:12:26.457 --> 02:12:27.638]  Well, shame on Fox.
[02:12:27.638 --> 02:12:30.321]  I mean, it's disgusting that they Alex, I'm sorry.
[02:12:30.321 --> 02:12:32.243]  I'm still a little sore with Fox.
[02:12:32.243 --> 02:12:34.585]  They should be there telling everybody about this.
[02:12:34.585 --> 02:12:35.346]  This is news.
[02:12:36.207 --> 02:12:43.794]  Especially after you spent so much money with them, an American company, and all your ad says is join me for a symposium on cyber security.
[02:12:43.794 --> 02:12:46.216]  Well, who's against a cyber security symposium?
[02:12:46.216 --> 02:12:49.539]  That shows they've got a lot of pressure put on them and the system is scared of this.
[02:12:50.722 --> 02:12:51.603]  A hundred percent.
[02:12:51.603 --> 02:12:56.529]  And I want everyone to know, Fox didn't just lose on this, their $50 million.
[02:12:56.529 --> 02:12:57.750]  MyPillow did.
[02:12:57.750 --> 02:13:01.054]  That's another million dollars we were taking a hit for.
[02:13:01.054 --> 02:13:07.041]  But I'm not going to do, oh I need money so I succumb to this cancel culture with Fox leading the way.
[02:13:07.601 --> 02:13:09.341]  You know, they wouldn't run this ad.
[02:13:09.341 --> 02:13:12.902]  Where's it coming to when all of a sudden they're not going to run ads?
[02:13:12.902 --> 02:13:14.782]  Maybe that's an ad for a concert.
[02:13:14.782 --> 02:13:16.203]  Oh yeah, let's see who's playing.
[02:13:16.203 --> 02:13:18.523]  And then decide, well, we don't want them to play that.
[02:13:18.523 --> 02:13:21.164]  This is our First Amendment right of free speech.
[02:13:21.164 --> 02:13:25.905]  I said it before, Alex, I said, last week I said Fox should become a weather channel.
[02:13:25.905 --> 02:13:28.685]  And then I changed it the next day and I said, you know what?
[02:13:28.685 --> 02:13:31.986]  Probably not, because they probably wouldn't report an oncoming storm.
[02:13:32.859 --> 02:13:34.260]  Exactly, that's a great point.
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:38.822]  Let's talk about CNN's claim of no evidence, where they say, have you been conned?
[02:13:38.822 --> 02:13:41.023]  Have you been manipulated?
[02:13:41.023 --> 02:13:42.924]  Speak to that and how do you know?
[02:13:42.924 --> 02:13:49.047]  I'm sure you've had other cybersecurity experts look at what you were brought or how have you verified this information?
[02:13:49.047 --> 02:13:54.870]  I have spent the last five months, since the day I got the first piece of evidence on January 9th,
[02:13:56.235 --> 02:13:56.555]  I don't
[02:14:17.208 --> 02:14:17.749]  I don't know.
[02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:41.401]  And it's one thing, it's great to have a complete set, too, because otherwise, let's say you're in Wisconsin.
[02:14:41.401 --> 02:14:45.847]  Well, how do we know in northern Wisconsin they didn't flip votes from Biden to Trump?
[02:14:45.847 --> 02:14:48.490]  Well, because we have the whole election, everybody.
[02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:50.753]  So CNN, when they tried to say there that
[02:14:51.494 --> 02:14:59.398]  Oh yeah, Mike Lindell, he's gonna, we're worried about Mike, you know, he might lose his reputation and he might hurt his company.
[02:14:59.398 --> 02:15:02.440]  You know, I mean, the guy Drew interviewed me, I go, really?
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:05.582]  Oh, now you really came out here because you care about me?
[02:15:05.582 --> 02:15:09.504]  No, you came out here to do some big hit job on me.
[02:15:10.024 --> 02:15:12.125]  And say the evidence is invalid.
[02:15:12.125 --> 02:15:14.187]  What more can I say to the people?
[02:15:14.187 --> 02:15:15.567]  Come to the Symposium.
[02:15:15.567 --> 02:15:17.429]  Watch the Cyber Symposium.
[02:15:17.429 --> 02:15:19.230]  CNN was invited.
[02:15:19.230 --> 02:15:26.614]  Come there and if you can prove that I'm wrong, that it's from the 2020 election, you get five million dollars.
[02:15:26.614 --> 02:15:26.774]  Exactly.
[02:15:26.774 --> 02:15:27.975]  Why are they trying to stop?
[02:15:27.975 --> 02:15:33.278]  Because the mainstream media has been trying to stop and others have been trying to stop you even having this event and not running your ad.
[02:15:33.278 --> 02:15:34.319]  That doesn't look good.
[02:15:34.319 --> 02:15:37.701]  You're putting your money up, your energy, and it's put up or shut up time.
[02:15:37.701 --> 02:15:39.062]  You're the one putting it all on the line here.
[02:15:39.895 --> 02:15:41.576]  Yeah, you know why they're scared of, Alex?
[02:15:41.576 --> 02:15:46.659]  They're scared of... We want to get a billion people to watch this, and I mean that.
[02:15:46.659 --> 02:15:52.102]  You know, I said that they gave fun of last week, or when I said I wanted to be bigger than Elvis Presley.
[02:15:52.102 --> 02:15:54.384]  Hello from Hawaii in 1973.
[02:15:54.384 --> 02:15:56.985]  I was seen worldwide by over a billion people.
[02:15:56.985 --> 02:15:58.286]  Stay there, stay there, Mike Lindell.
[02:15:58.746 --> 02:16:07.170]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:08.190]  Here's why.
[02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:12.112]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:16:12.112 --> 02:16:17.234]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:16:17.234 --> 02:16:25.638]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:16:26.218 --> 02:16:34.211]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:40.991]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:16:40.991 --> 02:16:44.832]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:16:44.832 --> 02:16:46.833]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:16:46.833 --> 02:16:55.254]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:16:55.254 --> 02:16:57.595]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:16:58.135 --> 02:16:59.076]  Hey everybody!
[02:16:59.076 --> 02:17:04.583]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:17:04.583 --> 02:17:07.046]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:17:07.046 --> 02:17:07.887]  Here's the thing.
[02:17:07.887 --> 02:17:12.171]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:17:12.171 --> 02:17:13.133]  Survival soup beans.
[02:17:13.513 --> 02:17:21.718]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:17:21.718 --> 02:17:22.819]  The best part?
[02:17:22.819 --> 02:17:31.845]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:17:32.105 --> 02:17:33.125]  Gets even better!
[02:17:33.125 --> 02:17:43.887]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[02:17:43.887 --> 02:17:44.708]  Period.
[02:17:44.708 --> 02:17:46.728]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:46.728 --> 02:17:48.888]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:48.888 --> 02:17:52.969]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[02:17:52.969 --> 02:17:54.850]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:54.850 --> 02:17:56.290]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:18:00.478 --> 02:18:03.764]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[02:18:03.764 --> 02:18:07.230]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:09.975]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[02:18:09.975 --> 02:18:10.876]  And that's my allegory.
[02:18:11.926 --> 02:18:22.994]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:25.316]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[02:18:25.316 --> 02:18:31.040]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not pipe.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:37.264]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[02:18:37.264 --> 02:18:38.705]  It's a total solution.
[02:18:38.705 --> 02:18:39.866]  All around the best you're going to find.
[02:18:39.986 --> 02:18:40.966]  Turbo Force.
[02:18:40.966 --> 02:18:43.227]  Without you, we don't roll.
[02:18:43.227 --> 02:18:44.948]  With you, we surge forward together.
[02:18:44.948 --> 02:18:46.988]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[02:18:46.988 --> 02:18:49.589]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:52.650]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:54.451]  It's a win-win.
[02:18:54.451 --> 02:18:55.111]  360 together.
[02:18:55.111 --> 02:18:56.571]  Info or store.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:18:59.850 --> 02:19:04.013]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[02:19:04.013 --> 02:19:08.117]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[02:19:08.117 --> 02:19:10.439]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[02:19:10.439 --> 02:19:15.243]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[02:19:15.243 --> 02:19:18.986]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[02:19:19.366 --> 02:19:27.888]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[02:19:27.888 --> 02:19:35.229]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:35.229 --> 02:19:39.350]  A whole bunch of our best-selling products are 50% off despite the fact they're selling out.
[02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:46.692]  That's why it's a flash sale of Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, our Greens Formula, of course our high-quality Vitamin D3 Formula with Calcium.
[02:19:46.852 --> 02:19:47.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:17.569 --> 02:20:19.730]  All right, Mike Lindell, one more segment.
[02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:21.030]  He promises to come back next week.
[02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:23.051]  I'm going to be going to the symposium.
[02:20:23.051 --> 02:20:30.014]  Mike Lindell, ladies and gentlemen, is about to get on a plane and fly to Cisco, Texas, where he'll be the Keystone keynote speaker tonight.
[02:20:30.014 --> 02:20:33.616]  And I can tell you, everybody I know is moving that whole area up by Cisco.
[02:20:33.616 --> 02:20:35.637]  A lot of the folks have left Austin.
[02:20:35.637 --> 02:20:39.018]  Some of the prominent families, friends of mine, because the city has fallen to the left.
[02:20:39.018 --> 02:20:40.399]  Everybody's moving up by Cisco.
[02:20:40.399 --> 02:20:40.799]  It's crazy.
[02:20:41.579 --> 02:20:44.282]  Point blank, I'm looking to keep in this office, but I may move up by Cisco.
[02:20:44.282 --> 02:20:46.945]  It's funny, Cisco, the whole area keeps popping up.
[02:20:46.945 --> 02:20:48.306]  Super patriotic.
[02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:50.669]  Mike Lindell, get into the word you're getting around the country.
[02:20:50.669 --> 02:20:59.279]  Not just your big hack data proof, but other things coming out of Wisconsin, other things coming out of Arizona, other things just proving what you've been saying coming out of Georgia.
[02:20:59.279 --> 02:21:00.320]  So much more, Mike Lindell.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:01.961]  Right on.
[02:21:01.961 --> 02:21:04.423]  And yeah, I am speaking tonight too at 8.15.
[02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:07.205]  You can see that at frankspeech.com live.
[02:21:07.205 --> 02:21:08.846]  It'll be an hour and a half speech.
[02:21:08.846 --> 02:21:14.090]  I'm going to be telling a lot more than I can tell you right now, but there are great things coming out of Georgia.
[02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:15.832]  There are great things coming out of Wisconsin.
[02:21:15.832 --> 02:21:17.253]  You might have heard an announcement today.
[02:21:17.253 --> 02:21:18.694]  I guess they subpoenaed.
[02:21:18.694 --> 02:21:22.637]  I'm just hearing it right now because I've been so busy today, but they're subpoenaed.
[02:21:22.637 --> 02:21:27.081]  Well, they're subpoenaed all the folks who were grabbing the briefcases out when they shut things down with the water main.
[02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:32.436]  Okay, but yeah, they're doing some more subpoenas in Wisconsin, too, to do audits there.
[02:21:32.436 --> 02:21:46.528]  You guys, after, when we do this symposium on the 10th, 11th, and 12th, once you get to the 9th and 12th, just everybody remember, we're going to bring all of this to the Supreme Court, but all these states are, it's just all separate.
[02:21:46.528 --> 02:21:50.512]  Every state's going to want to do an audit, not just the six in question.
[02:21:50.512 --> 02:21:52.974]  Let me show you what we're going to tell you at the symposium.
[02:21:52.974 --> 02:21:54.896]  Do you know New Hampshire went to Donald Trump?
[02:21:55.456 --> 02:21:57.357]  Minnesota went to Donald Trump.
[02:21:57.357 --> 02:22:04.100]  Of course all those other five, we talked about Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, I mean all these.
[02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:05.480]  But we're going to have stuff on there.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:09.082]  You're going to get real data that, let's say it's Ohio.
[02:22:09.082 --> 02:22:11.143]  What did Donald Trump really win Ohio by?
[02:22:11.143 --> 02:22:12.163]  Almost double.
[02:22:12.163 --> 02:22:13.744]  Florida, every single thing.
[02:22:13.744 --> 02:22:16.785]  We're going to talk about North Carolina, how they tried to take North Carolina too.
[02:22:17.285 --> 02:22:19.767]  You know, so this is going to be absolutely amazing.
[02:22:19.767 --> 02:22:25.192]  But you've got this this main thing that we have all the packet captures and the data.
[02:22:25.192 --> 02:22:29.015]  And then you've got all these things you talk about, Alex, with all these states.
[02:22:29.015 --> 02:22:31.477]  They're just it's all going to come down.
[02:22:31.477 --> 02:22:37.242]  We're going to I'm telling you, everybody, this election is getting pulled down, just like I said months ago.
[02:22:37.242 --> 02:22:39.004]  And our real president is going to be back in.
[02:22:39.619 --> 02:22:42.861]  Well Mike, I know you're working around the clock of the six minutes we have left with you.
[02:22:42.861 --> 02:22:44.862]  Hell, I might just drive up to Cisco myself.
[02:22:44.862 --> 02:22:47.264]  As I mentioned before, I really love what you're doing.
[02:22:47.264 --> 02:22:48.524]  I've given you my advice.
[02:22:48.524 --> 02:22:50.045]  You're as smart as I am or smarter.
[02:22:50.045 --> 02:22:52.407]  We're both entrepreneurs and American patriots.
[02:22:52.407 --> 02:22:56.949]  And you're not putting all your eggs in one basket with a symposium and a Supreme Court.
[02:22:56.949 --> 02:22:58.991]  You've been talking about the states, the other audits.
[02:22:58.991 --> 02:23:04.274]  I'm just saying, in general, we've got to keep fighting because we know there was fraud all over the place for the midterms coming up.
[02:23:04.674 --> 02:23:20.359]  So regardless, so Trump can run again if need be, or whoever, because if we don't fix this, and now 20 plus states have passed laws to stop a lot of the fraud this time, and so one way or another the media is trying to act like if we don't reinstate Trump by the end of August, we're liars or we're losers.
[02:23:20.359 --> 02:23:20.499]  No!
[02:23:21.019 --> 02:23:22.000]  We're battling them.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:22.660]  They're scared.
[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:26.523]  This Attorney General is trying to shut down the state's investigating.
[02:23:26.523 --> 02:23:27.364]  What are they scared of?
[02:23:27.364 --> 02:23:34.089]  I'm just saying I don't like putting dates on things and no one is hard charging like you, not even President Trump.
[02:23:34.089 --> 02:23:37.212]  And we appreciate him coming out and saying, little, the election was stolen.
[02:23:37.212 --> 02:23:38.072]  These are communists.
[02:23:38.072 --> 02:23:38.793]  These are bad.
[02:23:38.793 --> 02:23:40.334]  You know, I should be reinstated.
[02:23:40.334 --> 02:23:41.215]  That's great.
[02:23:41.215 --> 02:23:46.259]  I'm just simply saying we're going to fight this war like George Washington and persevere and you're out there leading it.
[02:23:47.435 --> 02:23:51.238]  Well, what I'm saying is this, Al, you know, you say all these states are passing laws.
[02:23:51.238 --> 02:23:53.279]  Here's the bottom line, everybody.
[02:23:53.279 --> 02:23:56.141]  If these machines aren't gone, there is no 2022.
[02:23:56.141 --> 02:23:59.283]  You know, garbage like this.
[02:23:59.283 --> 02:24:00.724]  This is from Brian Kemp.
[02:24:00.724 --> 02:24:04.347]  I got in the mail today from Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia.
[02:24:04.347 --> 02:24:05.507]  You know how corrupt he is.
[02:24:05.507 --> 02:24:05.868]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:05.868 --> 02:24:07.089]  Urgent, urgent, urgent.
[02:24:07.089 --> 02:24:09.170]  Election integrity is under attack.
[02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:10.431]  And then he wanted money from me.
[02:24:11.031 --> 02:24:12.453]  You know, he wanted money for him.
[02:24:12.453 --> 02:24:19.860]  And remember, Ryan Kemp bought $107 million worth of Dominion machines in 2019 on taxpayers' money.
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:28.048]  If the machines aren't gone, which they will be, and we have at the symposium, we're going to also unveil a whole new way to do elections.
[02:24:28.935 --> 02:24:31.697]  And it's, we're going to give the technology out.
[02:24:31.697 --> 02:24:35.418]  We're just going to give it away because we want, this has to change.
[02:24:35.418 --> 02:24:37.920]  Alex, I got a good plan for the machines.
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:45.704]  We melt them all down into prison bars, and then the ones that helped China do this, we have a good place, good use for them.
[02:24:45.704 --> 02:24:47.925]  And this is serious, everybody.
[02:24:47.925 --> 02:24:51.887]  You can have all the election things and talk about all that you want.
[02:24:51.887 --> 02:24:52.687]  It's done.
[02:24:52.687 --> 02:24:55.569]  Unless we, that's why it's so important.
[02:24:55.569 --> 02:24:58.110]  This was a cyber attack by China.
[02:24:58.711 --> 02:25:11.333]  And this was, I'm pretty sure you had all these, you know, let me tell, I want to say something real quick about, you know, when we talk about, you hear stories like 20-some thousand people in Georgia where non-residents have voted or 20-some thousand in Nevada.
[02:25:11.972 --> 02:25:13.813]  That's not true, everybody.
[02:25:13.813 --> 02:25:16.533]  These people, people are genuinely, there's good people.
[02:25:16.533 --> 02:25:20.334]  27,000 people didn't go vote that were non-residents.
[02:25:20.334 --> 02:25:23.635]  They used the 2010 voter rolls and it was done.
[02:25:23.635 --> 02:25:27.076]  They needed to use names, so they hack in and use them names.
[02:25:27.076 --> 02:25:28.836]  That's why you have dead people that voted.
[02:25:28.836 --> 02:25:29.357]  Oh, exactly.
[02:25:29.357 --> 02:25:34.458]  The Democrats are on record creating a list of people that have moved out of state to then steal their identity, basically.
[02:25:35.546 --> 02:25:37.168]  No, this was an attack.
[02:25:37.168 --> 02:25:39.470]  They used the 2010 voter rolls.
[02:25:39.470 --> 02:25:42.493]  That's what I'm saying is they steal their voter roll name and use it, yeah.
[02:25:43.211 --> 02:25:47.092]  Right, but this was done by the time the tax came out of China.
[02:25:47.092 --> 02:25:57.735]  Now, what part of the Democrat Party they used, or if they used some of the Republican Party, we're going to show you all that, what actually happened and how they used those voter rolls.
[02:25:57.735 --> 02:25:59.235]  You had to poll things.
[02:25:59.235 --> 02:26:05.837]  That's why, Alex, you have a lot of states where in the rural areas you had more people voted than live in the county.
[02:26:05.837 --> 02:26:08.698]  That's because a lot of them died or they moved out of that county since 2010.
[02:26:09.998 --> 02:26:10.519]  We're good to go.
[02:26:29.617 --> 02:26:36.041]  Then you have these things in the middle of the night, like in Michigan, 100,000 votes went for Biden.
[02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:41.044]  Well, you had to bring in votes, bring in ballots, and everyone's going, well, you know what?
[02:26:41.044 --> 02:26:50.109]  Those Democrats, everybody votes Democrat, and then those mail-in votes, the mail-in votes were counted on the morning of the 3rd, not in the middle of the night on the 4th.
[02:26:50.109 --> 02:26:55.912]  So we're going to take a lot of these lies out of the picture, and we're going to make it all make sense, everybody.
[02:26:56.632 --> 02:26:57.573]  Mike, I believe you.
[02:26:57.573 --> 02:26:58.214]  It's amazing.
[02:26:58.214 --> 02:26:58.874]  You're on fire.
[02:26:58.874 --> 02:27:00.155]  You're crisscrossing the country.
[02:27:00.155 --> 02:27:03.978]  You promised you'd be interviewed again this weekend or next week as this builds up towards this symposium.
[02:27:03.978 --> 02:27:12.005]  But let's spend two minutes on what allows you to do this, what allows me to be on air under all the Democratic attacks, under all the globalist garbage, and that's money.
[02:27:12.005 --> 02:27:23.414]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans, and with promo code Alex,
[02:27:24.255 --> 02:27:29.336]  With MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[02:27:29.336 --> 02:27:30.237]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:27:30.237 --> 02:27:34.038]  Instead of giving the money to the big box store, you fund what you're doing, you fund what I'm doing.
[02:27:34.038 --> 02:27:37.479]  You cannot spend money a better place and get great products.
[02:27:37.479 --> 02:27:41.480]  Tell folks in the minute we have left about the special of Promo Code Alex.
[02:27:42.543 --> 02:27:45.084]  Yeah, with the promo code out, you are getting the best ever.
[02:27:45.084 --> 02:27:48.505]  And you can get it at MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com.
[02:27:48.505 --> 02:27:50.666]  But you guys are getting my sheets.
[02:27:50.666 --> 02:27:54.267]  I put everything to pass the savings on, especially after dropping box.
[02:27:54.267 --> 02:27:59.288]  Everybody, everything, the savings are going right to you because we don't have the big box stores.
[02:27:59.288 --> 02:28:03.850]  So you got sheets as low as $49.99, my Gees and Dreams sheets.
[02:28:03.850 --> 02:28:05.030]  You got towels, $39.99, normally $109.99.
[02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:06.211]  We have another special on there.
[02:28:06.211 --> 02:28:06.651]  You get my book.
[02:28:10.772 --> 02:28:12.495]  And you get this patriotic pillow.
[02:28:12.495 --> 02:28:13.777]  He said, in God, we trust.
[02:28:13.777 --> 02:28:18.484]  It's got the American flag and this and the Statue of Liberty for nineteen dollars for both.
[02:28:18.484 --> 02:28:21.268]  I mean, these just it's across the board.
[02:28:21.268 --> 02:28:24.372]  Slippers, bathrobes, over one hundred and ten products.
[02:28:24.372 --> 02:28:25.474]  And Alex, I'm going to say this.
[02:28:25.854 --> 02:28:32.238]  If you go to CrankSpeech.com and you go to that board, I added entrepreneurs that we have from MyStore.com.
[02:28:32.238 --> 02:28:35.120]  You can also use the promo code Alex there.
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.883]  These are all products that I've added that are just entrepreneurs.
[02:28:38.883 --> 02:28:41.084]  They're coming up on my other platform.
[02:28:41.084 --> 02:28:43.966]  They have all these great USA products, you guys.
[02:28:43.966 --> 02:28:44.727]  Go there.
[02:28:44.727 --> 02:28:47.789]  This helps finance myself for the symposium.
[02:28:47.789 --> 02:28:51.031]  Helps great podcasts and shows like Alex has here.
[02:28:51.031 --> 02:28:53.673]  Everyone wants to know what to do.
[02:28:58.777 --> 02:29:07.204]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:08.225]  Here's why.
[02:29:08.225 --> 02:29:11.528]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:12.128 --> 02:29:17.253]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:17.253 --> 02:29:26.241]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:26.241 --> 02:29:34.228]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:34.927 --> 02:29:41.029]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:29:41.029 --> 02:29:44.850]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:44.850 --> 02:29:46.871]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:46.871 --> 02:29:55.274]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:29:55.274 --> 02:29:57.635]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:30:00.071 --> 02:30:03.816]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:30:03.816 --> 02:30:07.541]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:30:07.541 --> 02:30:14.831]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:30:15.171 --> 02:30:20.936]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:30:20.936 --> 02:30:33.166]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:30:33.166 --> 02:30:35.308]  I need your help more than ever now.
[02:30:35.308 --> 02:30:39.332]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:30:39.932 --> 02:30:50.019]  Pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarestore.com.
[02:30:50.019 --> 02:30:59.545]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:30:59.545 --> 02:31:00.206]  Thank you so much.
[02:31:00.931 --> 02:31:04.313]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[02:31:04.313 --> 02:31:14.258]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[02:31:14.258 --> 02:31:17.620]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:29.186]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[02:31:30.026 --> 02:31:34.690]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[02:31:34.690 --> 02:31:36.771]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[02:31:36.771 --> 02:31:41.074]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsTour.com, you get great products, you get the same time.
[02:31:41.074 --> 02:31:50.741]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[02:31:50.741 --> 02:31:58.127]  That's our job, so please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock troops in the information war.
[02:31:58.628 --> 02:32:00.023]  Find us at InfoWarsTore.com
[02:32:01.127 --> 02:32:07.550]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:14.933]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[02:32:14.933 --> 02:32:21.797]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[02:32:21.797 --> 02:32:24.958]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[02:32:24.958 --> 02:32:27.679]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[02:32:27.679 --> 02:32:30.621]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[02:32:31.281 --> 02:32:41.347]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[02:32:41.347 --> 02:32:46.330]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[02:32:46.330 --> 02:32:55.455]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free and the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[02:32:55.455 --> 02:33:00.258]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarestore.com.
[02:33:02.887 --> 02:33:05.495]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:18.308 --> 02:33:19.189]  We are back live.
[02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:22.772]  Mike Lindell is swinging for the fences, fighting hard for America.
[02:33:22.772 --> 02:33:27.616]  A true Americana, a businessman, a patriot taking action.
[02:33:27.616 --> 02:33:32.200]  And that break, man, I wish you could hear during the break what he was saying, even more powerful than what he was saying on air.
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:37.845]  Try to recap that in the few minutes you've got left before you jump on that jet and fly down to Texas to be with us here tonight.
[02:33:37.845 --> 02:33:38.726]  They're up in Cisco.
[02:33:38.726 --> 02:33:44.531]  But recapping behind the scenes, two and a half hours boiled down to eight minutes on Anderson Cooper.
[02:33:45.351 --> 02:33:46.052]  I don't know.
[02:34:03.747 --> 02:34:05.028]  That's exactly right.
[02:34:05.028 --> 02:34:07.469]  And I'll say that again right off the bat there before I tell the CNN.
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:31.870]  You go to FrankSpeech.com, you go there now, you're going to get all ready to watch, to tell your friends, share it, to watch the symposium.
[02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:37.477]  But while you're there, you go, you click, it's about three squares down, you click and you're going to go to this marketplace.
[02:34:37.477 --> 02:34:42.203]  You're going to use promo code Alex and you're going to, that is supporting everything I'm doing.
[02:34:42.683 --> 02:34:44.907]  And you're supporting great shows like this.
[02:34:44.907 --> 02:34:48.633]  You guys, you're going to see specials on there you don't see on MyPillow.com.
[02:34:48.633 --> 02:34:53.280]  You're going to see entrepreneurs that are on there that are on my other platform, MyStore.com.
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:56.865]  Now, remember, you can go ahead and use Alex on MyPillow and MyStore.com.
[02:34:56.865 --> 02:34:57.747]  Use them over there, too.
[02:34:58.047 --> 02:35:00.128]  To get up to 66% off.
[02:35:00.128 --> 02:35:07.010]  But if you go to FranksBeach.com, you combine two, you get their specials there that are the best prices ever.
[02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:14.373]  And then you also get to watch FranksBeach.com and for the Cyber Symposium and share that everywhere.
[02:35:14.373 --> 02:35:19.235]  By the way, tonight that will be, when I speak tonight, that will be at FranksBeach.com.
[02:35:19.235 --> 02:35:22.536]  It'll be live streamed at 8.15 Central Time.
[02:35:22.536 --> 02:35:24.257]  I'll have a great message for the world.
[02:35:24.817 --> 02:35:28.858]  And it gets to be what I was saying now when we were up here.
[02:35:28.858 --> 02:35:32.199]  CNN interviewed me for two and a half hours, everybody.
[02:35:32.199 --> 02:35:36.581]  They got this lady behind me going, ask him this, attack him here, attack him here.
[02:35:36.581 --> 02:35:46.684]  We went back and forth and I battled those people and all these guys since November 4th, every day, especially after I got all the evidence on January 9th.
[02:35:46.684 --> 02:35:48.004]  Now we went back and forth.
[02:35:48.004 --> 02:35:52.866]  They couldn't get anything out of the best they could do was eight minutes on Anderson Cooper.
[02:35:53.306 --> 02:35:53.467]  Yeah.
[02:36:10.988 --> 02:36:22.413]  Probably 12 million dollars I've spent on my own money getting investigated, hiring white hat hackers, doing everything I can for the last six months to get this ready for the Cyber Symposium.
[02:36:22.413 --> 02:36:32.197]  You guys, one of the things on the first day, my head lawyer, he's going to do, he's going to talk about our pathway after the symposium and we're going to, it's called a Quo Warranto.
[02:36:32.197 --> 02:36:34.618]  We're going to bring it all to the Supreme Court.
[02:36:34.618 --> 02:36:36.159]  All the states will be the plaintiffs.
[02:36:36.679 --> 02:36:39.140]  And when it gets there, they're going to vote 9-0.
[02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:45.384]  I've been saying this for five months because this is non-subjective evidence, everybody, that you're all going to see.
[02:36:45.384 --> 02:36:47.865]  And everyone says the Supreme Court will never do that.
[02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:50.046]  Yes, they will, because you know what?
[02:36:50.046 --> 02:36:53.188]  They're Americans and they grew up the American dream.
[02:36:53.188 --> 02:36:58.071]  They have families, they have children, grandchildren, neighbors, friends, family.
[02:36:58.071 --> 02:37:00.352]  And this was an attack by China on our election.
[02:37:01.619 --> 02:37:04.381]  And the Democrats warned us about this attack.
[02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:05.002]  They warned us.
[02:37:05.002 --> 02:37:08.143]  Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, they warned us.
[02:37:08.143 --> 02:37:11.626]  But, you know, they didn't capture these packets like these heroes did.
[02:37:11.626 --> 02:37:23.593]  But the Supreme Court then is going to pull this down and it's going to be 9-0 because it can't be like 7-2 because you can't argue with what we're going to show on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[02:37:23.593 --> 02:37:27.075]  It's unchangeable, irrefutable, non-subjective.
[02:37:27.075 --> 02:37:28.056]  So when they do that,
[02:37:28.999 --> 02:37:31.243]  They're going to now they're going to be a lot of offices.
[02:37:31.243 --> 02:37:33.768]  Well, Mike, will they put Donald Trump in right away?
[02:37:33.768 --> 02:37:36.613]  Well, they should because there's precedence.
[02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:40.881]  Every elected official in United States history where they found out.
[02:37:41.545 --> 02:37:41.885]  That's right.
[02:38:00.231 --> 02:38:03.255]  And also, you know, we had down tickets in this election.
[02:38:03.255 --> 02:38:04.637]  We're affected too.
[02:38:04.637 --> 02:38:06.019]  All across the board.
[02:38:06.019 --> 02:38:09.223]  So I don't know, maybe the Supreme Court, they're the Supreme Court.
[02:38:09.223 --> 02:38:14.471]  Maybe they say, hey, we need to have a new election and get rid of these machines and have a whole new election.
[02:38:14.471 --> 02:38:15.752]  And Mike, let me say this.
[02:38:15.752 --> 02:38:16.313]  Let me say this.
[02:38:17.074 --> 02:38:18.495]  They did steal the election.
[02:38:18.495 --> 02:38:19.776]  It is a fraud.
[02:38:19.776 --> 02:38:21.858]  Biden's telling people that he had his butt wiped on TV.
[02:38:21.858 --> 02:38:23.920]  He doesn't know what planet he's on.
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:25.702]  All this evil's coming out.
[02:38:25.702 --> 02:38:27.843]  I agree they're going to have to replace Biden regardless.
[02:38:27.843 --> 02:38:37.912]  So we are going into the waters where the Supreme Court, if there's enough public pressure and a court of public opinion and the evidence is out there, because the Supreme Court are political and they're also scared.
[02:38:37.912 --> 02:38:39.614]  They're being blackmailed by CNN and threatened.
[02:38:40.034 --> 02:38:42.696]  And if they see momentum, they would do the right thing.
[02:38:42.696 --> 02:38:43.196]  I agree with you.
[02:38:43.196 --> 02:38:47.258]  But regardless, we're exposing the machines and we're fighting to change that.
[02:38:47.258 --> 02:38:50.420]  And so that's why, regardless of what you're doing, you're winning, brother.
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:52.921]  You're the man in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about.
[02:38:52.921 --> 02:38:57.804]  That's all I'm saying is, I appreciate a man that puts everything on one number.
[02:38:57.804 --> 02:39:00.146]  I'm just saying, brother, what you're doing is wonderful.
[02:39:00.146 --> 02:39:03.748]  And regardless of what happens in the next few months, we're moving in the right direction.
[02:39:03.748 --> 02:39:04.248]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:05.949]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:05.949 --> 02:39:07.330]  And you know, you bring up a point there.
[02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:10.053]  Everyone says, well, the Supreme Court, one of them's compromised.
[02:39:10.053 --> 02:39:12.655]  They're always saying there's three liberals and all this stuff.
[02:39:12.655 --> 02:39:18.039]  Well, let me tell you, back when they voted 7-2 not to look at it, number one, they didn't have this evidence.
[02:39:18.039 --> 02:39:19.520]  But let me tell you something, Alex.
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:33.392]  Back then, if I was a Democrat, and I'm not talking about the party, but if I was a Democrat, I would go, wow, those lawyers that, I mean, those justices that Donald Trump put in, they're fair, because these guys really thought they won then.
[02:39:33.992 --> 02:39:40.358]  But now, over 30% of Democrats don't believe it was an attack, that they didn't win a cyberattack.
[02:39:40.358 --> 02:39:42.519]  And over 90% of Republicans.
[02:39:42.519 --> 02:39:52.328]  So this time, the evidence that I'm putting out there, that you're going to see on the 10th, 11th, and 12th, it gives them, it makes the Supreme Court, they will be off the hook.
[02:39:52.748 --> 02:39:56.569]  They can look over and say, hey, I can't say this isn't what it is.
[02:39:56.569 --> 02:40:00.410]  Because with this evidence, it is what it is.
[02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:01.691]  It's non-subjective.
[02:40:01.691 --> 02:40:02.851]  That's what the beauty of it.
[02:40:02.851 --> 02:40:05.072]  And that's why everybody needs to tune in.
[02:40:05.072 --> 02:40:11.154]  What you said there, Alex, about having pressure, that's why we want a billion people to watch this.
[02:40:11.154 --> 02:40:11.854]  And I mean that.
[02:40:11.854 --> 02:40:19.836]  We're going to have people from other countries speaking, and two, because they're worried about this 2020 election and getting rid of these machines.
[02:40:19.836 --> 02:40:21.657]  If we get enough people to watch,
[02:40:22.874 --> 02:40:23.875]  I'm talking a billion.
[02:40:23.875 --> 02:40:27.376]  If everybody watches, there's no argument about what's going to unfold there.
[02:40:27.376 --> 02:40:46.566]  And by the way, let me stop you because I'm not trying to toot my horn, but the reason all the Democrats sued me and came after me in 2016, we had 87 million different IP addresses on our streams in a five-day period of the election alone, not to mention our affiliates and then YouTube and Google.
[02:40:46.566 --> 02:40:47.007]  We had
[02:40:47.907 --> 02:40:50.008]  We had a half a billion views that week.
[02:40:50.008 --> 02:41:02.377]  And so, absolutely, if people get excited, if they take action, if I had, in my whole history on YouTube, seven, eight billion views, and then I got half a billion in less than a week, just, I mean, that happened.
[02:41:02.377 --> 02:41:14.044]  This can happen on our own platforms as long as we're willing to pay for the bandwidth, which is what I know, brother, what it's costing you, because I know Frank's speech has taken off on average 200,000 viewers at any time, millions a day.
[02:41:14.044 --> 02:41:15.025]  You are the future.
[02:41:15.025 --> 02:41:15.706]  I am the future.
[02:41:15.706 --> 02:41:17.447]  Our listeners supporting us.
[02:41:17.967 --> 02:41:19.028]  Because I know we talked off-air.
[02:41:19.028 --> 02:41:20.349]  You're 100% in.
[02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:21.670]  I've got a big nice house.
[02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:22.811]  The new property values are going up.
[02:41:22.811 --> 02:41:23.632]  I put my money in it.
[02:41:23.632 --> 02:41:25.434]  I'm selling it right now to fund my operation.
[02:41:25.434 --> 02:41:26.195]  Exactly.
[02:41:26.195 --> 02:41:27.456]  Freedom is what matters.
[02:41:27.456 --> 02:41:28.076]  I'm all in.
[02:41:28.076 --> 02:41:29.037]  You're all in.
[02:41:29.037 --> 02:41:33.301]  MyPillow.com promo code Alex or FrankSpeech.com promo code Alex.
[02:41:33.301 --> 02:41:40.567]  And I want to support that great new marketplace you created with all those great new entrepreneurs because that's going to be the future as us coming together.
[02:41:40.567 --> 02:41:41.889]  And that's MyStore.com.
[02:41:43.361 --> 02:41:48.619]  I know there's a lot of great sides, but all of them can use promo code Alex.
[02:41:48.619 --> 02:41:49.662]  Explain that one more time to me.
[02:41:50.595 --> 02:41:53.717]  Yeah, you can use them on all, all can use promo code Alex.
[02:41:53.717 --> 02:42:01.543]  Right now, I put the best specials up though on PrayingSpeech.com because we need, you need to get in there and get signed up and get ready.
[02:42:01.543 --> 02:42:11.171]  But you go down there and, and you can use it there to get the best specials ever, which is, you know, you get my six pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[02:42:11.171 --> 02:42:15.194]  You can get my games of dreams sheets, normally a hundred and some dollars a set for like,
[02:42:16.014 --> 02:42:16.114]  Yes.
[02:42:46.295 --> 02:42:56.230]  With Alex's great show, InfoWars, and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack and cancel business.
[02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.430]  Beautiful.
[02:42:56.430 --> 02:42:57.572]  You're an example of resistance.
[02:42:57.572 --> 02:42:58.574]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[02:43:02.173 --> 02:43:03.434]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:43:03.434 --> 02:43:03.814]  Welcome.
[02:43:03.814 --> 02:43:04.274]  Go ahead.
[02:43:04.274 --> 02:43:05.575]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:06.135]  Good, brother.
[02:43:06.135 --> 02:43:07.216]  Great last caller.
[02:43:07.216 --> 02:43:10.277]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:43:10.277 --> 02:43:15.980]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:43:15.980 --> 02:43:17.561]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[02:43:18.081 --> 02:43:19.763]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:43:19.763 --> 02:43:20.724]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:43:20.724 --> 02:43:21.104]  Go ahead.
[02:43:21.104 --> 02:43:21.505]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:21.505 --> 02:43:22.626]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:43:22.626 --> 02:43:25.649]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:43:25.649 --> 02:43:27.331]  The X Team does wonders.
[02:43:27.331 --> 02:43:28.472]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:43:28.472 --> 02:43:29.653]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:43:29.653 --> 02:43:30.454]  Get off the fence.
[02:43:30.454 --> 02:43:31.315]  Get the product.
[02:43:31.315 --> 02:43:32.516]  Support the InfoWars.
[02:43:32.516 --> 02:43:33.837]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:43:33.837 --> 02:43:34.478]  You're on the air.
[02:43:34.478 --> 02:43:35.039]  Thanks for holding.
[02:43:35.039 --> 02:43:35.279]  Go ahead.
[02:43:35.419 --> 02:43:36.019]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:36.019 --> 02:43:37.100]  It's great to be on with you.
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:37.840]  It's an honor.
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:38.140]  Honor.
[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:38.681]  Talk to you.
[02:43:38.681 --> 02:43:39.821]  Awesome.
[02:43:39.821 --> 02:43:43.423]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[02:43:43.423 --> 02:43:44.304]  Alpha Power.
[02:43:44.304 --> 02:43:47.985]  Even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[02:43:47.985 --> 02:43:49.346]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[02:43:49.346 --> 02:43:50.907]  So, just number one for a few days.
[02:43:50.907 --> 02:43:51.988]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:43:51.988 --> 02:43:53.628]  It's not a joke.
[02:43:53.628 --> 02:43:54.349]  Absolutely.
[02:44:00.168 --> 02:44:06.936]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[02:44:06.936 --> 02:44:10.501]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[02:44:10.501 --> 02:44:14.025]  Even more than the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[02:44:14.025 --> 02:44:18.471]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[02:44:19.619 --> 02:44:20.460]  Well guess what?
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:34.448]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[02:44:35.649 --> 02:44:41.153]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[02:44:41.153 --> 02:44:47.496]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[02:44:47.496 --> 02:44:56.822]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[02:44:56.822 --> 02:44:57.863]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:00.385 --> 02:45:08.568]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:45:08.568 --> 02:45:17.330]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:19.271]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[02:45:19.671 --> 02:45:19.931]  I think so.
[02:45:39.433 --> 02:45:44.177]  For $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy.
[02:45:44.177 --> 02:45:49.601]  Friends and family of these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[02:45:49.601 --> 02:45:52.244]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[02:45:52.244 --> 02:45:57.488]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[02:45:57.488 --> 02:46:00.010]  They're 50% off right now at infowarestore.com.
[02:46:00.885 --> 02:46:06.947]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:46:06.947 --> 02:46:14.450]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:46:14.450 --> 02:46:16.771]  Well, it's all come down to this.

[02:46:47.064 --> 02:46:48.265]  Thank you and God bless.

[02:46:55.567 --> 02:46:57.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:36.257 --> 02:47:40.862]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide in the final segment of what I'm about to host.
[02:47:40.862 --> 02:47:44.426]  We have our great guest host coming up here today.
[02:47:44.426 --> 02:47:47.950]  Harrison Smith is going to be knocking it out of the park.
[02:47:50.578 --> 02:48:03.874]  I really appreciate the listeners and the viewers, and I just want to ask all of you to pray for America, to pray for the world, to pray for a global awakening, because I told you a month ago, I said the hospitals are really full now, and most of the folks dead and dying have taken the shot.
[02:48:03.874 --> 02:48:08.460]  That's now in the national statistics, international statistics, and I said it's also hitting a lot of good people.
[02:48:09.745 --> 02:48:13.369]  And I know when there's a real plague going on, you don't see it on the news.
[02:48:13.369 --> 02:48:24.960]  I had my uncle and my cousin and my dad's older cousin, that was like his uncle, all die in a month of pneumonia seven years ago in 2014.
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:26.441]  So I know how real it is.
[02:48:26.441 --> 02:48:29.104]  They all died in the month of January.
[02:48:29.104 --> 02:48:34.609]  And I mean, I can just tell you that this is very, very serious.
[02:48:36.058 --> 02:48:41.121]  And I have family that didn't listen to me and took the vaccine and got very, very sick.
[02:48:41.121 --> 02:48:46.225]  And I also have other people that I consider family that are in bad trouble right now.
[02:48:46.225 --> 02:48:48.006]  And so I just want you to know this is not just me.
[02:48:48.006 --> 02:48:51.669]  I tell you, I don't just go off intelligence or mainstream news.
[02:48:51.669 --> 02:48:52.889]  I go off the ground.
[02:48:52.889 --> 02:48:53.850]  I'm very observant.
[02:48:53.850 --> 02:48:55.271]  And this is real bad.
[02:48:55.271 --> 02:48:56.612]  This is real bad.
[02:48:56.612 --> 02:48:59.694]  And I want Fauci and I want Bill Gates and all you to know something.
[02:48:59.694 --> 02:49:01.655]  I'm going to hold you all personally responsible.
[02:49:01.655 --> 02:49:03.016]  You understand that?
[02:49:03.016 --> 02:49:04.377]  That makes you come after me quick or good.
[02:49:04.377 --> 02:49:05.338]  Let's just get this going here.
[02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:09.062]  Because I've had enough of your crap.
[02:49:09.062 --> 02:49:11.504]  And I'm sick of your crap.
[02:49:11.504 --> 02:49:15.326]  You murdering, bloodthirsty garbage.
[02:49:15.326 --> 02:49:17.608]  And I just, I just, you know, I'm a humble person.
[02:49:17.608 --> 02:49:25.213]  I don't like to pray in public and I pray privately, but I just pray to God that the chains of these evil people be broken.
[02:49:25.213 --> 02:49:34.220]  But if that's going to be done, we first have to repent for the fact that we have killed 65 million innocent babies in this country and treated them like crap.
[02:49:35.768 --> 02:49:43.610]  And treated them like they were lower than a worm you'd pull out of some packet of dirt and put on a hook.
[02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:50.452]  I mean, I feel bad for a worm when I'm sticking it on the end of a hook, but I know I'm going to catch fish on it, so I do it.
[02:49:50.452 --> 02:49:57.694]  My need to hunt and my need to catch a fish, it gets me past the point of I feel bad sticking a worm on the end of that hook while it's alive.
[02:49:57.694 --> 02:50:01.756]  But the fish bite on that, they don't bite on a rubber worm.
[02:50:01.756 --> 02:50:02.996]  That's where my conscience is at.
[02:50:04.005 --> 02:50:08.688]  I think about Fauci, for no reason other than evil, just to have six scientists in there.
[02:50:08.688 --> 02:50:14.452]  It's a cult to like implant baby dogs, puppies with worms that eat their bodies.
[02:50:14.452 --> 02:50:18.215]  I mean, and I know you're a new listener, you hear that, you think this is crazy, he's making it up.
[02:50:18.215 --> 02:50:19.596]  I get you think I'm making it up.
[02:50:19.596 --> 02:50:20.937]  I'm not making any of it up.
[02:50:20.937 --> 02:50:24.979]  They have sex with the babies, then they partial birth abort before they kill them.
[02:50:24.979 --> 02:50:27.641]  I mean, it's come out in court cases.
[02:50:27.641 --> 02:50:30.163]  I mean, I'm not making any of this up.
[02:50:31.476 --> 02:50:44.705]  I'm not making any of it up and I wish to God it wasn't true and I wish to God every day that we weren't under attack by these people but I don't need to read the news or even call up a local medical facility to find out they're full of people right now.
[02:50:44.705 --> 02:50:47.727]  I already see it.
[02:50:47.727 --> 02:50:55.092]  And people better get right with God and you better get healthy and I'm telling myself that and you better get your body juiced up with all the natural things God's given us because
[02:50:56.533 --> 02:51:04.822]  Man, when you look at the scum, and you look at the trash, and you look at Steve Jobs' ex-wife, and you look at Jelena Maxwell, and you look at all these guys.
[02:51:04.822 --> 02:51:09.146]  To them, it's all about what they're doing to us, and how they have this power over us.
[02:51:09.146 --> 02:51:17.215]  They enjoy that power, just like Ed Buck liked to lure homeless black men into his house, and drug them up, and then kill them.
[02:51:19.244 --> 02:51:24.726]  And he'd hang over them, the ones that survived, and say, I'm sucking your soul.
[02:51:24.726 --> 02:51:25.667]  You're all alone now.
[02:51:25.667 --> 02:51:26.567]  God can't help you.
[02:51:26.567 --> 02:51:30.969]  With a huge red skull poster on the ceiling.
[02:51:30.969 --> 02:51:37.072]  The whole ceiling was this giant skull with red light behind it with this demon saying, I'm sucking your energy.
[02:51:37.072 --> 02:51:38.233]  I'm going to get you.
[02:51:38.233 --> 02:51:38.953]  That's them!
[02:51:38.953 --> 02:51:39.913]  That's Joe Biden!
[02:51:39.913 --> 02:51:40.874]  That's Bill Gates!
[02:51:40.874 --> 02:51:41.274]  Him!
[02:51:41.274 --> 02:51:42.074]  That spirit!
[02:51:42.074 --> 02:51:43.275]  That's the enemy right there!
[02:51:44.574 --> 02:51:53.042]  And why we sit there and let them be the authority over us and do this to us, I will never figure out.
[02:51:53.042 --> 02:51:54.983]  But Joe Biden is Ed Buck.
[02:51:54.983 --> 02:52:00.208]  And some like to... I haven't figured it all out, I've just studied him.
[02:52:00.208 --> 02:52:05.393]  And I'm not saying women don't get attacked.
[02:52:05.393 --> 02:52:06.574]  But I've studied these Satanists.
[02:52:08.624 --> 02:52:13.249]  Women are not even what they're into because women procreate and are powerful and are this engine of life.
[02:52:13.249 --> 02:52:15.151]  They just want to dumb them down and control them.
[02:52:15.151 --> 02:52:17.733]  They want little boys.
[02:52:17.733 --> 02:52:18.434]  They want men.
[02:52:18.434 --> 02:52:20.576]  They want to screw men over.
[02:52:20.576 --> 02:52:23.039]  And they like to get little boys they can hurt and abuse.
[02:52:23.039 --> 02:52:27.863]  And they like to get strong men they can have power over and dominate and break.
[02:52:27.863 --> 02:52:29.045]  And that's what these guys are into.
[02:52:30.154 --> 02:52:33.395]  And so what better than a big strong black man that they can do that to?
[02:52:33.395 --> 02:52:40.618]  It's disgusting, it's pathetic, it's satanic, but really it's of their father the devil because what does Satan want?
[02:52:40.618 --> 02:52:46.239]  He wants to get God's creation and screw with it and dominate it so Satan can feel powerful.
[02:52:46.239 --> 02:52:53.042]  And the minute you wake up to the fact that these people are devil worshippers is the minute we can start beating them.
[02:52:53.042 --> 02:52:53.742]  It's just that simple.
[02:52:54.892 --> 02:52:56.853]  They are the scum of the earth.
[02:52:56.853 --> 02:52:59.854]  And these little girls have come in public and they get shut down on the news.
[02:52:59.854 --> 02:53:00.995]  People sued Biden over it.
[02:53:00.995 --> 02:53:03.196]  They get shut down by the corrupt courts.
[02:53:03.196 --> 02:53:07.718]  And Joe Biden pinches their ass.
[02:53:07.718 --> 02:53:09.759]  You see the dads grabbing their daughters away when he does it.
[02:53:09.759 --> 02:53:17.602]  He pinches little girls on the butt and then tells them, you're making me really horny right now.
[02:53:17.602 --> 02:53:23.465]  And see, he gets off on the little girl's first sexual experience is a demonic pedophile leaning over him.
[02:53:24.417 --> 02:53:33.584]  And then his son is in photos with the niece naked after they've had sex, smoking crack, with 12-year-old.
[02:53:33.584 --> 02:53:38.047]  That's just the beginning!
[02:53:38.047 --> 02:53:40.429]  And now they want a relationship with your children.
[02:53:40.429 --> 02:53:42.490]  Now they want to...
[02:53:45.438 --> 02:53:58.824]  Put a GMO system made out of cloned cells of a dead white kid from 1966 and a dead black lady from 1951 and then a jellyfish gene?
[02:53:58.824 --> 02:54:00.604]  Genome?
[02:54:00.604 --> 02:54:01.605]  And you say, what's that for?
[02:54:01.605 --> 02:54:04.306]  They say, you don't worry about that.
[02:54:04.306 --> 02:54:07.547]  But it's because they know those cells never die and keep replicating.
[02:54:07.547 --> 02:54:10.268]  The jellyfish is a hive organism.
[02:54:10.268 --> 02:54:12.269]  It's a composite organism.
[02:54:12.269 --> 02:54:13.610]  Jellyfish is not one creature.
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:20.402]  A jellyfish is a... a hive is the wrong term.
[02:54:20.402 --> 02:54:22.522]  It is a... what's the term?
[02:54:22.522 --> 02:54:25.703]  It's coming to me in a minute.
[02:54:25.703 --> 02:54:27.144]  It's like a hive, but it's not.
[02:54:27.144 --> 02:54:33.125]  It's a... doesn't matter, you can look it up for yourself.
[02:54:33.125 --> 02:54:36.346]  It's all a bunch of cells that work in unison together, but it's not one group.
[02:54:36.346 --> 02:54:37.407]  It's a colony organism.
[02:54:37.407 --> 02:54:38.307]  It's a colony organism.
[02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:50.957]  They're injecting a colony organism's genome with this white kid and this black woman's genes that never die, which means they just keep replicating in you.
[02:54:50.957 --> 02:54:56.441]  Well, whatever these cells are mixed with makes them powerful.
[02:54:56.441 --> 02:54:58.042]  And they are putting that into you.
[02:54:58.042 --> 02:55:00.003]  God knows what they've done.
[02:55:00.003 --> 02:55:06.627]  I mean, we're like, hey, the studies show it gives you cancer and eats your body alive and causes blood clots.
[02:55:06.627 --> 02:55:07.888]  That's just a side effect.
[02:55:09.224 --> 02:55:12.005]  It does something far more evil.
[02:55:12.005 --> 02:55:14.265]  Makes you magnetic, takes over your body.
[02:55:14.265 --> 02:55:16.206]  We're going to talk about the documents, the science of it.
[02:55:16.206 --> 02:55:20.127]  I've already taped an hour and a half long interview with David Icke that was the best ever.
[02:55:20.127 --> 02:55:22.108]  I've got a bunch of other huge guests I'm interviewing today.
[02:55:22.108 --> 02:55:24.348]  I'll be here until six, seven to nine interviewing them.
[02:55:24.348 --> 02:55:27.809]  We're going to air it five o'clock tomorrow.
[02:55:27.809 --> 02:55:32.611]  Five o'clock tomorrow, it will stream out and it will also be posted to Bandot Video.
[02:55:32.611 --> 02:55:37.072]  It's probably going to be four hour long with just a few breaks in it.
[02:55:38.619 --> 02:55:44.461]  And look for that tomorrow, and I don't know how long we'll be here, but every day I can work, I'm going to be here.
[02:55:44.461 --> 02:55:49.963]  I mean, you think I want to go on an airplane and go to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and be there with being mobbed by people three days?
[02:55:49.963 --> 02:55:50.604]  I've got to go to that.
[02:55:50.604 --> 02:55:53.004]  It's too important.
[02:55:53.004 --> 02:55:55.165]  I mean, I know you'd rather not be tuned into this hearing.
[02:55:55.165 --> 02:55:57.286]  You'd rather be out fishing or out doing something normal, right?
[02:55:57.286 --> 02:55:57.646]  I get it.
[02:55:57.646 --> 02:55:58.306]  Believe me.
[02:55:58.306 --> 02:55:59.667]  They're not going to leave us alone, folks.
[02:55:59.667 --> 02:56:00.787]  We can't hide from this.
[02:56:00.787 --> 02:56:01.648]  All right?
[02:56:01.648 --> 02:56:04.269]  And I can't hold back and hope they don't destroy me.
[02:56:04.269 --> 02:56:06.249]  Just, no, I've got to just full on go 110%.
[02:56:09.241 --> 02:56:11.665]  It was the best advice I ever got my football coach on the eighth grade.
[02:56:11.665 --> 02:56:13.428]  He said, Alex, you do some great plays.
[02:56:13.428 --> 02:56:14.129]  You're really strong.
[02:56:14.129 --> 02:56:15.090]  You do good.
[02:56:15.090 --> 02:56:18.736]  But notice when you get hurt is when you don't go 100% every time.
[02:56:18.736 --> 02:56:23.403]  And I learned, like, you better go 100% every time or you're going to lose.
[02:56:23.403 --> 02:56:24.004]  You're going to get hurt.
[02:56:24.787 --> 02:56:27.831]  But it's when you go 100%, it's almost like you can't get hurt.
[02:56:27.831 --> 02:56:28.972]  But if I do, that's the way it is.
[02:56:28.972 --> 02:56:38.084]  Because I'm not going to be signed up with you pedophiles and you devil worshippers that pull a baby out of a woman and take it in the back room and rape it because it's the most twisted thing you can think of.
[02:56:38.084 --> 02:56:40.467]  Or you cut its scalp off and put it on a rat.
[02:56:40.467 --> 02:56:42.229]  Or you inject puppy dogs with maggots.
[02:56:43.451 --> 02:56:47.994]  So, we gotta, I know these people are scary folks, but they gotta be faced.
[02:56:47.994 --> 02:56:51.097]  We gotta expose them, and my job is to laze them.
[02:56:51.097 --> 02:56:57.683]  My job is to light them up with a spotlight for you, politically, so that we can culturally say no to them and resist them.
[02:56:57.683 --> 02:57:07.551]  And so when you magnify what we do here, you are literally turning up the spotlight on the cockroaches that Ted Nugent talks about so much.
[02:57:07.551 --> 02:57:09.193]  So, we've got Harrison Smith.
[02:57:10.407 --> 02:57:17.511]  Coming in here on the other side today, and I really, really appreciate Harrison Smith and all the great work he does.
[02:57:17.511 --> 02:57:19.312]  And then we've got the War Room coming up.
[02:57:19.312 --> 02:57:22.273]  Owen Shore had a really well-deserved week off to go see his family in St.
[02:57:22.273 --> 02:57:25.455]  Louis, Missouri, and he'll be back next week as well.
[02:57:25.455 --> 02:57:29.937]  That's good, because I've got to go to the symposium and so much more.
[02:57:29.937 --> 02:57:31.618]  So thanks to the crew and the great job they've done.
[02:57:31.618 --> 02:57:32.579]  Please pray for InfoWars.
[02:57:32.579 --> 02:57:34.140]  Please pray for all our crew.
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:37.323]  All our people that work here, they really need your prayers and support.
[02:57:37.323 --> 02:57:40.567]  So please think about each of the people that work here and pray for them.
[02:57:40.567 --> 02:57:43.570]  Alright, that's it for my part of the transmission.
[02:57:43.570 --> 02:57:46.594]  Coming up... Harrison Smith.
[02:57:48.857 --> 02:57:53.018]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[02:57:53.018 --> 02:57:57.120]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:59.440]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here.
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:04.222]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[02:58:04.222 --> 02:58:07.963]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[02:58:08.363 --> 02:58:16.893]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[02:58:16.893 --> 02:58:23.901]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:58:50.540 --> 02:58:53.422]  The biosecurity state is here.
[02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:59.326]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[02:58:59.326 --> 02:59:10.955]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person.
[02:59:26.491 --> 02:59:28.472]  I'm implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[02:59:28.472 --> 02:59:31.334]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:59:31.334 --> 02:59:41.320]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:42.741]  And wars will continue to set fast.
[02:59:42.741 --> 02:59:43.261]  We fight this.
[02:59:43.261 --> 02:59:44.742]  I don't know how long we can.
[02:59:44.742 --> 02:59:46.123]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[02:59:46.123 --> 02:59:47.744]  God bless and good luck.
[02:59:47.744 --> 02:59:52.487]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[02:59:52.487 --> 02:59:55.109]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:13.655]  All right, welcome ladies and gentlemen to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.655 --> 03:00:14.655]  My name is Harrison Smith.
[03:00:14.655 --> 03:00:16.797]  I am the morning host here at InfoWars.
[03:00:16.797 --> 03:00:20.039]  I host a show called American Journal 8 to 11 a.m.
[03:00:20.039 --> 03:00:22.020]  Central Standard Time each and every morning.
[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:23.141]  It's a call-in show.
[03:00:23.141 --> 03:00:26.823]  We take a lot of your calls and boy do we get some interesting calls.
[03:00:26.823 --> 03:00:27.864]  We had a very fun one today.
[03:00:27.864 --> 03:00:39.332]  If you didn't have a chance to watch today's episode while we were interviewing Ivory Hecker, we had a caller call in and ask about interdimensional demons and boy was I not expecting Ivory Hecker's answer.
[03:00:40.052 --> 03:00:41.992]  To be the one that she gave.
[03:00:41.992 --> 03:00:43.433]  Very, very interesting stuff.
[03:00:43.433 --> 03:00:50.494]  So you're going to have to go to InfoWars.com and check out the American Journal to catch that, because it is very exciting and fun.
[03:00:50.494 --> 03:01:02.257]  Now, there's a lot to talk about today, but I was sort of inspired by a headline on InfoWars.com, using a term that I've used quite a bit, actually, recently.
[03:01:02.257 --> 03:01:03.157]  Neo-feudalism!
[03:01:03.937 --> 03:01:13.122]  Neo-feudalism, as we know, the so-called Great Reset being promoted by everybody from the UN to the Royal Family to Joe Biden to Klaus Schwab.
[03:01:13.122 --> 03:01:16.404]  You know what it is, but do you know what it really is?
[03:01:16.404 --> 03:01:28.231]  What it really is is the Great Merger, the Great Combining of the most powerful forces in our entire world coming together in one singular monolithic control mechanism in order to
[03:01:29.011 --> 03:01:36.337]  Well, destroy human liberty worldwide and install themselves as the ruling elite over a planet of serfs.
[03:01:36.337 --> 03:01:45.405]  And so, what I've done is compiled this giant stack of stories while I was watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:45.405 --> 03:01:54.333]  And this is a stack of what I like to call your new dystopia, where I'm laying out exactly what the world will look like if these people get their way.
[03:01:54.333 --> 03:01:54.774]  And trust me,
[03:01:56.161 --> 03:01:57.142]  Yeah, it's not pretty.
[03:01:57.142 --> 03:01:58.263]  It's not pretty at all.
[03:01:58.263 --> 03:02:01.486]  Actually, it's quite horrific.
[03:02:01.486 --> 03:02:02.246]  Rather horrific.
[03:02:02.246 --> 03:02:17.179]  So we're going to be taking a look at what Facebook and Amazon and Google and BlackRock and all of the other massive corporations that are now walking in lockstep towards a grim and disturbing future.
[03:02:17.179 --> 03:02:19.861]  What they have in mind for you and for all of humanity.
[03:02:19.861 --> 03:02:22.143]  But first I want to go to this video, clip number five.
[03:02:23.809 --> 03:02:28.673]  InfoWars superfan, really, DataBattleZ.
[03:02:28.673 --> 03:02:44.768]  He was at a anti-lockdown, anti-mandated vaccine, anti-mask, pro-liberty march in Orlando, Florida last weekend, and he had some fun giving out InfoWars Life products to people who attended, and he put together this little video.
[03:02:44.768 --> 03:02:49.572]  So here is DataBattleZ with his InfoWars Life product toss in Orlando.
[03:02:49.572 --> 03:02:49.913]  Here it is.
[03:02:51.684 --> 03:02:56.606]  I'm going to take this opportunity to hand out some InfoWars products and the first thing I'm going to hand out is the DVD.
[03:02:56.606 --> 03:02:58.367]  Hey man, take a copy of Endgame.
[03:03:02.281 --> 03:03:05.124]  Would you folks like a copy of Endgame from InfoWars?
[03:03:05.124 --> 03:03:05.464]  Sure.
[03:03:05.464 --> 03:03:07.085]  There you go, take one copy.
[03:03:07.085 --> 03:03:16.073]  Data Battle Z with a backpack full of Endgame DVDs, seeing other people with InfoWars shirts, so he's got a stack of DVDs.
[03:03:16.073 --> 03:03:18.575]  There you go guys, I'm gonna give you this bottle of Alphapower.
[03:03:18.575 --> 03:03:22.979]  Gives this guy some Alphapower, cause this guy's already wearing the Saber Frost t-shirt.
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:27.103]  Oh man, I talked over him, but he just said Alex Jones is always right.
[03:03:27.103 --> 03:03:30.787]  Make sure you're going to M4AutoStore.com and buying some of the great supplements.
[03:03:48.395 --> 03:03:52.317]  I thought I would tell you about some of the great products from the InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:03:52.317 --> 03:03:55.978]  So right here, I got the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filtration System.
[03:03:55.978 --> 03:03:58.099]  It is the best air filter on the market.
[03:03:58.099 --> 03:04:01.701]  You guys should go to the website, InfoWarsStore.com, and read up on it.
[03:04:01.701 --> 03:04:02.741]  It is the best.
[03:04:02.741 --> 03:04:04.842]  Next up, I got the DNA Force Plus here.
[03:04:04.842 --> 03:04:06.122]  I got Alpha Power.
[03:04:06.122 --> 03:04:08.423]  I got the Supermail Vitality and the X2.
[03:04:08.423 --> 03:04:10.264]  I could not start my day without this stuff.
[03:04:10.264 --> 03:04:12.225]  It gives me the energy I need to get through the day.
[03:04:12.725 --> 03:04:17.729]  Last but not least, I got the Vitamin Mineral Fusion next to the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[03:04:17.729 --> 03:04:21.573]  Just like the air filter is the best air filter, this water filter is the best water filter.
[03:04:21.573 --> 03:04:23.154]  There's the little survival spring.
[03:04:23.154 --> 03:04:23.855]  So check it out.
[03:04:23.855 --> 03:04:25.476]  You can get yours today at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:04:27.185 --> 03:04:31.808]  Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is an InfoWars superfan.
[03:04:31.808 --> 03:04:33.029]  I forgot at the very end.
[03:04:33.029 --> 03:04:39.313]  He tells you not to forget the ultimate fish oil, Data Battle Z. Doing some good work out there.
[03:04:39.313 --> 03:04:44.477]  Spreading the gospel of InfoWars and your own personal health.
[03:04:44.477 --> 03:04:45.478]  Folks, if you want to go,
[03:04:46.937 --> 03:04:50.083]  Go to blacktemplewarrestore.com and purchase a product.
[03:04:50.083 --> 03:04:57.518]  Everything that you spend at that website goes directly into this program, American Journal, The War Room, and all of the activism we do here.
[03:04:57.518 --> 03:04:58.820]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:00.293 --> 03:05:06.358]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:05:06.358 --> 03:05:13.864]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:05:13.864 --> 03:05:16.186]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:05:16.186 --> 03:05:19.669]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:29.856]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[03:05:29.856 --> 03:05:35.741]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.

[03:05:46.489 --> 03:05:47.750]  Thank you and God bless.

[03:06:01.800 --> 03:06:02.921]  Big Brother.
[03:06:02.921 --> 03:06:04.742]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:04.742 --> 03:06:06.624]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:06.624 --> 03:06:08.305]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:08.305 --> 03:06:09.966]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:09.966 --> 03:06:14.510]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.746 --> 03:06:17.967]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:17.967 --> 03:06:19.508]  My name's Harrison Smith.
[03:06:19.508 --> 03:06:27.832]  Excuse me while I pinch myself, since I still have a hard time believing that I actually work at InfoWars.
[03:06:27.832 --> 03:06:32.455]  My God, I've been a fan for InfoWars since I was probably 12 or 13 years old.
[03:06:32.455 --> 03:06:39.519]  And here to be hosting the Alex Jones Show, I can tell you, is an honor beyond my meager comprehension.
[03:06:39.519 --> 03:06:43.601]  So I'll do my best to live up to this incredible platform that
[03:06:44.520 --> 03:06:48.182]  The Infowarriors out there have been kind enough to give to me.
[03:06:48.182 --> 03:06:57.545]  So I'd like to talk about what our coming dystopia will look like when the big tech companies have their way and have total control of every system of our lives.
[03:06:57.545 --> 03:07:00.107]  But first I want to talk about how we're going to get there.
[03:07:00.107 --> 03:07:01.807]  And I'll show you a couple videos.
[03:07:01.807 --> 03:07:06.089]  One you may have seen if you've been watching Infowars the past six months ago.
[03:07:06.089 --> 03:07:07.890]  We've played it a few times.
[03:07:07.890 --> 03:07:08.970]  It's the Milgram experiment.
[03:07:08.970 --> 03:07:10.271]  But I'm going to show you another experiment.
[03:07:11.271 --> 03:07:15.954]  The video of which has been going around on Twitter today called the Ash Experiment.
[03:07:15.954 --> 03:07:38.025]  These experiments highlight very important aspects of human psychology that are now at work worldwide through the human population and being exploited, utilized, and really maximized in order to bring about total subjugation willingly in the American people, or in really the people of Earth, everybody worldwide, because this is not just an American problem.
[03:07:40.011 --> 03:07:42.513]  So let's begin first with the Milgram Experiment.
[03:07:42.513 --> 03:07:44.575]  Again, you've probably heard of it, you probably know it.
[03:07:44.575 --> 03:08:04.893]  The Ash Experiment may be new to you and it'll really shock you, but let's refresh our memories, shall we, with this classic experiment from 1963, the Milgram Experiment, showing just how easy it is to get people to do things they never would have done before, really brutal things, up to and including murder, as long as
[03:08:06.069 --> 03:08:07.851]  Well, a scientist says so.
[03:08:07.851 --> 03:08:08.812]  Trust the science.
[03:08:08.812 --> 03:08:09.392]  It's a doctor.
[03:08:09.392 --> 03:08:10.974]  He's wearing a white coat.
[03:08:10.974 --> 03:08:12.115]  Do what he says.
[03:08:12.115 --> 03:08:13.777]  Kill your friend.
[03:08:13.777 --> 03:08:14.538]  And they do.
[03:08:14.538 --> 03:08:25.689]  It's absolutely incredible, but it is simple psychology that can be and has been exploited all over the world.
[03:08:25.689 --> 03:08:28.051]  Not just in singular individuals, but
[03:08:29.136 --> 03:08:31.198]  Even easier to do on a wider population.
[03:08:31.198 --> 03:08:32.919]  So, here it is.
[03:08:32.919 --> 03:08:34.060]  Enjoy it, if you can.
[03:08:34.060 --> 03:08:35.441]  Milgram Experiment 1963.
[03:08:35.441 --> 03:08:45.749]  A decade earlier, psychologist Stanley Milgram had also looked at how we respond to authority.
[03:08:47.705 --> 03:08:57.736]  In order to understand how people were induced to obey unjust regimes and participate in atrocities such as the Holocaust, he set up an experiment.
[03:08:57.736 --> 03:09:02.240]  Volunteers were told they were taking part in scientific research to improve memory.
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:06.965]  Could you open those and tell me which of you is which, please?
[03:09:06.965 --> 03:09:07.386]  I'm a teacher.
[03:09:07.386 --> 03:09:07.726]  I'm a teacher.
[03:09:10.146 --> 03:09:19.234]  Separated by a screen, the teacher would ask the learner questions in a word game and administer an electric shock when the answer was incorrect.
[03:09:19.234 --> 03:09:24.018]  He was told to increase the voltage with each wrong answer.
[03:09:24.018 --> 03:09:25.159]  Cloud.
[03:09:25.159 --> 03:09:26.060]  Horse.
[03:09:26.060 --> 03:09:26.701]  Rock.
[03:09:26.701 --> 03:09:28.542]  House.
[03:09:28.542 --> 03:09:30.164]  Answer.
[03:09:30.164 --> 03:09:33.367]  Wrong.
[03:09:33.367 --> 03:09:35.348]  150 volts.
[03:09:35.348 --> 03:09:35.869]  Answer.
[03:09:35.869 --> 03:09:36.169]  Horse.
[03:09:38.766 --> 03:09:39.567]  Experiment!
[03:09:39.567 --> 03:09:40.147]  That's all!
[03:09:40.147 --> 03:09:41.648]  Get me out of here!
[03:09:41.648 --> 03:09:42.789]  Get me out of here, please!
[03:09:42.789 --> 03:09:43.549]  Continue, please.
[03:09:43.549 --> 03:09:44.470]  Go right ahead.
[03:09:44.470 --> 03:09:45.330]  I refuse to go in!
[03:09:45.330 --> 03:09:46.111]  Let me out!
[03:09:46.111 --> 03:09:47.012]  He refuses to go in.
[03:09:47.012 --> 03:09:48.853]  The experiment requires you continue, teacher.
[03:09:48.853 --> 03:09:49.914]  Please continue.
[03:09:49.914 --> 03:09:56.318]  Participants didn't know that the learner was really an actor, and the so-called shocks, harmless.
[03:09:56.318 --> 03:09:57.218]  You're gonna get a shock.
[03:09:57.218 --> 03:09:57.799]  180 volts.
[03:09:57.799 --> 03:09:57.839]  Ow!
[03:10:03.405 --> 03:10:04.405]  I can't stand the pain!
[03:10:04.405 --> 03:10:05.166]  Let me out of this!
[03:10:05.166 --> 03:10:06.326]  You can't stand it now.
[03:10:06.326 --> 03:10:07.946]  I'm not gonna kill that man, eh?
[03:10:07.946 --> 03:10:10.667]  I mean, who's gonna take the responsibility if anything happens to that gentleman?
[03:10:10.667 --> 03:10:12.848]  I'm responsible for anything that happens here.
[03:10:12.848 --> 03:10:14.508]  Continue, please.
[03:10:14.508 --> 03:10:15.509]  Alright, next one.
[03:10:15.509 --> 03:10:16.649]  Slow!
[03:10:16.649 --> 03:10:20.170]  Walk, dance, trot, music!
[03:10:20.170 --> 03:10:29.973]  Two-thirds of volunteers were prepared to administer a potentially fatal electric shock when encouraged to do so by what they perceived as a legitimate authority figure.
[03:10:29.973 --> 03:10:32.414]  In this case, a man in a white coat.
[03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.930]  375 volts.
[03:10:33.930 --> 03:10:37.411]  I think something's happened to that power man.
[03:10:37.411 --> 03:10:39.373]  I don't get no answer.
[03:10:39.373 --> 03:10:41.154]  He was hollering on the Les Bowridge.
[03:10:41.154 --> 03:10:44.115]  Can't you check in and see if he's alright, please?
[03:10:44.115 --> 03:10:46.717]  Milgram's findings horrified America.
[03:10:46.717 --> 03:10:56.182]  They showed that decent American citizens were as capable of committing acts against their conscience as the Germans had been under the Nazis.
[03:10:56.182 --> 03:10:57.983]  There it is, the Milgram experiment.
[03:10:59.684 --> 03:11:22.217]  A couple of important things to notice from this experiment that once again simply illustrates a fundamental aspect of human psychology, which is that you can sort of offset your own guilt on somebody else if you think you are just doing something on behalf of a larger organization or it's not really your fault that you're the one doing the thing that you're doing.
[03:11:22.217 --> 03:11:23.478]  Again, basic
[03:11:24.477 --> 03:11:29.246]  Human psychology that the elites know about and exploit and utilize to enslave us.
[03:11:29.246 --> 03:11:30.829]  But a few things to note about that.
[03:11:30.829 --> 03:11:36.960]  First of all, what the experiment is that they told they were engaged in was to improve memory.
[03:11:38.174 --> 03:11:45.296]  Okay, now you can kind of justify this if it's like, well, you gotta question this guy to get information about an upcoming terrorist attack.
[03:11:45.296 --> 03:11:47.556]  You're saving lives here, so you gotta hurt this guy.
[03:11:47.556 --> 03:11:49.117]  Then maybe you can justify it in your head.
[03:11:49.117 --> 03:11:51.537]  There's something to justify this action.
[03:11:51.537 --> 03:11:54.258]  It's an experiment to improve memory, right?
[03:11:54.258 --> 03:12:02.360]  It's a simple test, no stakes, nothing that would justify this level of literal physical torture these people think that they're actually engaged in.
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:06.681]  And that shows you just how low the stakes have to be for people to be engaged in this.
[03:12:06.681 --> 03:12:07.621]  Just a memory experiment.
[03:12:08.490 --> 03:12:11.652]  There's no reason to be hurting anybody over a memory experiment.
[03:12:11.652 --> 03:12:17.876]  These people will not just hurt people, they'll have people crying out in pain and then thinking that they're dead and still delivering the jolts.
[03:12:17.876 --> 03:12:23.439]  Two-thirds, two-thirds of people participated in this and refused to stop the test.
[03:12:23.439 --> 03:12:24.400]  Truly incredible.
[03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:28.783]  But the real most important line in that entire video is the line that the doctor says.
[03:12:28.783 --> 03:12:31.445]  He says, I'm responsible for anything that happens here.
[03:12:32.264 --> 03:12:32.765]  And that's it.
[03:12:32.765 --> 03:12:33.966]  And that's all it takes.
[03:12:33.966 --> 03:12:40.294]  And you can look at everything from the FBI, to the Army, to scientists and doctors.
[03:12:40.294 --> 03:12:49.024]  When you give people incredible amounts of power, like say you give people the ability to press a button and send an electric shock to somebody that they can't even see.
[03:12:50.856 --> 03:12:54.119]  There's something in us that sort of rebels at having that power.
[03:12:54.119 --> 03:12:56.842]  It's a lot of responsibility to have a lot of power.
[03:12:56.842 --> 03:12:58.404]  To be an FBI agent?
[03:12:58.404 --> 03:12:58.984]  I mean, imagine.
[03:12:58.984 --> 03:13:05.110]  Just picture for yourself what it would be like to be able to walk up to any police officer, walk in the beat, or in his car,
[03:13:06.092 --> 03:13:10.515]  And to hold up your wallet and go, I'm in charge here, and have the cops say, yes sir, and walk away.
[03:13:10.515 --> 03:13:13.657]  You know, FBI agents can do whatever they want, right?
[03:13:13.657 --> 03:13:14.838]  That's a lot of power to have.
[03:13:14.838 --> 03:13:24.184]  Psychologically, you either got to be an insane narcissist to handle that much power that you've been given, or you have to offload that responsibility onto your superiors.
[03:13:24.184 --> 03:13:27.467]  So yes, I do have ultimate power if I'm an FBI agent in America.
[03:13:27.467 --> 03:13:28.728]  I can do basically whatever I want.
[03:13:29.619 --> 03:13:33.921]  But it's okay and I can handle it psychologically because I'm just doing what I'm told.
[03:13:33.921 --> 03:13:35.082]  I'm just following orders.
[03:13:35.082 --> 03:13:36.122]  It's not actually me.
[03:13:36.122 --> 03:13:40.064]  I am just a vessel for the orders from the people above me.
[03:13:40.064 --> 03:13:42.286]  It's their fault if I do anything wrong.
[03:13:42.286 --> 03:13:44.987]  That is the psychological mechanism that's at work here.
[03:13:44.987 --> 03:13:49.950]  But let's look at another very important scientific study.
[03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:51.991]  This one's called the ASH experiment.
[03:13:51.991 --> 03:13:56.153]  It took place in Britain and has to do more with group conformity.
[03:13:57.193 --> 03:13:58.514]  I don't even think this needs an intro.
[03:13:58.514 --> 03:14:00.435]  Just watch this and come to your own conclusions.
[03:14:00.435 --> 03:14:04.498]  Here it is.
[03:14:04.498 --> 03:14:10.643]  The ASH experiment is one of psychology's oldest and most popular pieces of research.
[03:14:10.643 --> 03:14:15.546]  A volunteer is told that he's taking part in a visual perception test.
[03:14:15.546 --> 03:14:23.792]  What he doesn't know is that the other participants are actors, and he's the only person taking part in the real test, which is actually about group conformity.
[03:14:23.792 --> 03:14:24.793]  Please begin.
[03:14:25.891 --> 03:14:29.314]  The experiment you'll be taking part in today involves the perception of line length.
[03:14:29.314 --> 03:14:36.899]  Your task will be simply to look at the line here on the left and indicate which of the three lines on the right is equal to it in length.
[03:14:36.899 --> 03:14:41.983]  So, for example... The actors have been told to match the wrong lines.
[03:14:41.983 --> 03:14:51.490]  The volunteer will be monitored to see if he gives the correct answer or if he goes along with the opinion of the group and gives the wrong answer.
[03:14:51.490 --> 03:14:53.852]  In the first test, the correct answer is two.
[03:14:55.746 --> 03:14:57.648]  Uh, one.
[03:14:57.648 --> 03:14:59.649]  One.
[03:14:59.649 --> 03:15:05.934]  One.
[03:15:05.934 --> 03:15:07.515]  Two.
[03:15:07.515 --> 03:15:10.357]  One.
[03:15:10.357 --> 03:15:12.759]  Once again, the correct answer is two.
[03:15:12.759 --> 03:15:14.120]  Three.
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:16.122]  Three.
[03:15:16.122 --> 03:15:22.386]  Three.
[03:15:22.386 --> 03:15:23.847]  Three?
[03:15:23.847 --> 03:15:24.088]  Three.
[03:15:25.242 --> 03:15:30.651]  The ASH experiment has been repeated many times and the results have been supported again and again.
[03:15:31.562 --> 03:15:33.463]  We will conform to the group.
[03:15:33.463 --> 03:15:35.743]  Again, we're very social creatures.
[03:15:35.743 --> 03:15:40.525]  We're very much aware of what the people around us think.
[03:15:40.525 --> 03:15:41.986]  We want to be liked.
[03:15:41.986 --> 03:15:45.567]  We don't want to be seen to rock the boat, so we will go along with the group.
[03:15:45.567 --> 03:15:53.690]  Even if we don't believe what people are saying, we'll still go along.
[03:15:53.690 --> 03:15:57.331]  Group dynamics is one of the most powerful forces in human psychology.
[03:15:58.976 --> 03:16:05.319]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[03:16:29.278 --> 03:16:30.098]  Hey, everybody.
[03:16:30.098 --> 03:16:33.339]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:33.339 --> 03:16:34.079]  Me too.
[03:16:34.079 --> 03:16:41.201]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:41.201 --> 03:16:45.603]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:45.603 --> 03:16:47.483]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:47.483 --> 03:16:48.503]  I certainly do.
[03:16:48.503 --> 03:16:49.444]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:49.444 --> 03:16:57.766]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[03:16:58.326 --> 03:17:03.770]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[03:17:29.167 --> 03:17:30.408]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:30.408 --> 03:17:34.332]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:34.332 --> 03:17:35.873]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:35.873 --> 03:17:38.836]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:38.836 --> 03:17:44.021]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:44.381 --> 03:17:45.583]  I can help you too.
[03:17:45.583 --> 03:17:48.506]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:48.506 --> 03:17:50.729]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:50.729 --> 03:17:55.175]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:55.175 --> 03:17:56.877]  That's DanPilla.com.

[03:17:59.946 --> 03:18:06.369]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[03:18:06.369 --> 03:18:13.752]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[03:18:13.752 --> 03:18:20.615]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[03:18:20.615 --> 03:18:23.796]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[03:18:23.796 --> 03:18:26.137]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[03:18:26.497 --> 03:18:32.662]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul.
[03:18:32.662 --> 03:18:40.189]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:45.173]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[03:18:45.173 --> 03:18:53.661]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride-free and the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.

[03:20:21.196 --> 03:20:23.537]  InfoWarsStore.com is where you go to support us.
[03:20:23.537 --> 03:20:30.219]  Remember, right now, the limited supply Flash Sale is happening, meaning some of our most popular products are on sale for 50% off.
[03:20:30.219 --> 03:20:36.121]  Now, these things fly off the shelves at full price, so who knows how long they'll last at 50% off.
[03:20:36.121 --> 03:20:40.082]  TurboForce is one of my particular favorite products.
[03:20:40.882 --> 03:20:48.000]  On the entire store, and uh, helps me not drink the incredibly sugar-laden energy drinks that I'm so very fond of.
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:49.784]  Uh, TurboForce has...
[03:20:50.859 --> 03:20:54.101]  A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the amount of sugar.
[03:20:54.101 --> 03:20:56.042]  It's actually good for you.
[03:20:56.042 --> 03:21:00.564]  It's healthy, and the energy that it gives you is not a spike and then a crash.
[03:21:00.564 --> 03:21:05.126]  It's a long, slow, smooth energy that can last all day.
[03:21:05.126 --> 03:21:09.208]  TurboForce, again, one of my favorite products and available right now at 50% off.
[03:21:09.208 --> 03:21:12.770]  BODY's also available at 50% off.
[03:21:12.770 --> 03:21:15.051]  Again, we had a call this morning from American Journal.
[03:21:15.051 --> 03:21:17.573]  Crazy story about BODY's.
[03:21:17.573 --> 03:21:19.654]  A guy who says he
[03:21:21.263 --> 03:21:23.964]  Started walking again after using bodies.
[03:21:23.964 --> 03:21:25.584]  It was absolutely wild.
[03:21:25.584 --> 03:21:32.046]  But you hear this stuff about these supplements because they're so powerful and they're all natural and they can really do some great things.
[03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:36.207]  I'm not a doctor, not making any claims here, alright?
[03:21:36.207 --> 03:21:43.528]  I'm just saying people have had really wonderful experiences and of course they come back again and again once they purchase it once.
[03:21:43.528 --> 03:21:48.850]  And heck, maybe you can be like Data Battle Z and just buy a whole handful of stuff and go hand it out at a
[03:21:50.233 --> 03:21:50.853]  Not a protest.
[03:21:50.853 --> 03:21:55.056]  That's a great way to support us and spread the word as well.
[03:21:55.056 --> 03:22:00.940]  Now, on to the topic of Neo-Feudalism and what exactly that looks like.
[03:22:00.940 --> 03:22:05.724]  Got a couple videos here to illustrate exactly what that looks like.
[03:22:05.724 --> 03:22:09.947]  First let's hear from a man who I hadn't seen before but I'm a big fan of now.
[03:22:09.947 --> 03:22:11.668]  He calls himself the Hard Hat Intellectual.
[03:22:13.220 --> 03:22:22.685]  So now, in case nobody figured it out, I mean, I'm pretty sure everybody probably should have figured it out, but in case, you know, there's people that didn't.
[03:22:22.685 --> 03:22:25.206]  Now you see why you were allowed to go to
[03:22:36.061 --> 03:22:45.144]  A Walmart or any of these big other corporations that were deemed essential to get your groceries or whatever it is that you needed to get.
[03:22:45.144 --> 03:22:52.187]  And why you couldn't go to a mom and pop shop that sold essentially the same things and get what you needed to get.
[03:22:52.187 --> 03:22:59.310]  Because they wanted to squeeze out all of these little places to basically remain the only options that people had left to go to.
[03:23:00.740 --> 03:23:10.230]  So that way they could implement these rules such as COVID passports and vaccination only for their employees.
[03:23:10.230 --> 03:23:15.995]  Because if they didn't do this first, mom and pop shops could have blew up.
[03:23:15.995 --> 03:23:19.138]  Because they could have counted it and been like, you can come work here.
[03:23:19.138 --> 03:23:20.880]  You don't have to be vaccinated.
[03:23:20.880 --> 03:23:22.362]  You can come shop here.
[03:23:22.362 --> 03:23:23.303]  You don't need to wear a mask.
[03:23:24.417 --> 03:23:26.198]  They could have did all of that.
[03:23:26.198 --> 03:23:29.181]  So how did they make sure that that didn't happen?
[03:23:29.181 --> 03:23:32.783]  Say that we have some essential and some non-essential businesses.
[03:23:32.783 --> 03:23:34.505]  We'll just squeeze them out.
[03:23:34.505 --> 03:23:35.826]  Yeah, literally as simple as that.
[03:23:35.826 --> 03:23:39.909]  And the thing is, it's not even speculation, I should say.
[03:23:41.946 --> 03:23:52.213]  If you look at who actually planned the lockdown and the response to coronavirus, it was Larry Fink of BlackRock, mostly, working with the federal government and advising them on exactly how to do this.
[03:23:52.213 --> 03:24:00.619]  If you look at Amazon and the unbelievably massive gains they've made over the last year while simultaneously lobbying for the lockdowns.
[03:24:00.619 --> 03:24:02.260]  I mean, this is the plan.
[03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:04.162]  And again, it's not speculation.
[03:24:04.162 --> 03:24:06.263]  We don't have to assume what these people want.
[03:24:06.263 --> 03:24:08.405]  They've actually come out and told us at this point.
[03:24:09.085 --> 03:24:10.185]  You know it as well as I do.
[03:24:10.185 --> 03:24:18.467]  I'm sure if you're watching the Alex Jones Show, you know that you will own nothing, you will have no privacy, and you will be happy.
[03:24:18.467 --> 03:24:20.948]  That's not just idle words.
[03:24:20.948 --> 03:24:21.788]  That's a promise.
[03:24:21.788 --> 03:24:23.549]  That's what they're actually implementing.
[03:24:23.549 --> 03:24:26.649]  So what does that actually look like?
[03:24:26.649 --> 03:24:28.490]  Well first, let's step back and understand.
[03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:34.831]  When they say, you will own nothing, you will have no privacy, and you will be happy, they mean you.
[03:24:34.831 --> 03:24:36.032]  They don't mean them.
[03:24:36.032 --> 03:24:37.052]  They will still own everything.
[03:24:38.356 --> 03:24:40.577]  They'll still have all the privacy in the world.
[03:24:40.577 --> 03:24:41.578]  You won't.
[03:24:41.578 --> 03:24:43.258]  Oh, but they certainly will.
[03:24:43.258 --> 03:24:46.180]  See, they're not even subtle about it anymore.
[03:24:46.180 --> 03:24:52.563]  They are literally now explicitly exempting themselves from the rules that they are saddling on everybody else.
[03:24:52.563 --> 03:24:54.764]  And I have a few examples for you here.
[03:24:54.764 --> 03:24:59.807]  From the UK, business travelers from big multinationals get English quarantine waiver.
[03:25:00.708 --> 03:25:01.268]  That's right, folks.
[03:25:01.268 --> 03:25:12.037]  Executives at large multinational companies will be allowed to skip quarantine in England if they're deemed to be bringing significant economic benefit, according to government rules laid out Tuesday.
[03:25:12.037 --> 03:25:14.119]  And this was back on June 29th, 2021.
[03:25:14.119 --> 03:25:27.290]  The announcement prompted anger from opposition MPs and business groups that represent excluded smaller companies, coming amid a backlash about sponsors and officials from football's governing bodies, FIFA and UEFA.
[03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:31.251]  Being allowed to enter the country for Euro 2020 without having to quarantine.
[03:25:31.251 --> 03:25:45.476]  So, in other words, if you come from some small company, if you don't represent a company and you just want to come to the UK, you've got to stay in a hotel, you've got to spend thousands of dollars to pay for that stay in the hotel, you've got to stay there for two weeks to quarantine before you're allowed to enter into the country.
[03:25:45.476 --> 03:25:48.537]  Unless, of course, you are of the elected class.
[03:25:48.537 --> 03:25:52.679]  Unless you are of the new, neo-feudal, noble elite.
[03:25:52.679 --> 03:25:56.080]  In which case, these laws literally just do not apply to you.
[03:25:56.963 --> 03:25:59.464]  And it's actually as simple as that.
[03:25:59.464 --> 03:26:01.004]  What about this story from just a few days ago?
[03:26:01.004 --> 03:26:07.266]  Google founder Larry Page gets New Zealand residency under new special visa for Uber wealthy.
[03:26:07.266 --> 03:26:08.607]  New Zealand totally locked down.
[03:26:08.607 --> 03:26:09.987]  You cannot visit New Zealand.
[03:26:09.987 --> 03:26:11.768]  You cannot go to New Zealand.
[03:26:11.768 --> 03:26:13.108]  New Zealand is off limits 100% unless...
[03:26:15.540 --> 03:26:18.804]  You're an executive for Google, in which case the laws don't apply to you.
[03:26:18.804 --> 03:26:19.565]  You're a noble.
[03:26:19.565 --> 03:26:20.126]  You're an elite.
[03:26:20.126 --> 03:26:24.352]  You're not a serf or a slave that must be restricted in your movement.
[03:26:24.352 --> 03:26:28.958]  You have all the movement you could possibly want because you're the elite.
[03:26:28.958 --> 03:26:30.160]  You're the elect.
[03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:30.821]  You're the chosen.
[03:26:32.406 --> 03:26:35.248]  Google co-founder Larry Page has gained New Zealand residency.
[03:26:35.248 --> 03:26:41.713]  Officials confirmed Friday, stoking debate over whether extremely wealthy people can essentially buy access to the South Pacific country.
[03:26:41.713 --> 03:26:43.954]  Well, they can buy access to absolutely anywhere.
[03:26:43.954 --> 03:26:45.576]  The laws don't apply to them.
[03:26:45.576 --> 03:26:48.077]  They're literally written that way.
[03:26:48.077 --> 03:26:52.120]  What about this video from earlier today?
[03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:56.964]  Representative Cori Bush says she deserves private security, but you need to suck it up and defund the police.
[03:26:58.424 --> 03:26:59.705]  We've said it a million times here.
[03:26:59.705 --> 03:27:01.586]  Defund the police means two things.
[03:27:01.586 --> 03:27:03.026]  Privatize the police.
[03:27:03.026 --> 03:27:04.267]  Federalize the police.
[03:27:04.267 --> 03:27:06.388]  Those are the goals of the defund the police movement.
[03:27:06.388 --> 03:27:12.791]  To have federal police that are not able to easily have oversight over them.
[03:27:13.715 --> 03:27:15.496]  Where you don't actually have control over them.
[03:27:15.496 --> 03:27:18.538]  You can't elect them like you elect a sheriff or a constable.
[03:27:18.538 --> 03:27:20.239]  They're controlled from Washington, D.C.
[03:27:20.239 --> 03:27:26.204]  and they carry out the orders of the federal government completely outside of the realm of control of the local powers.
[03:27:26.204 --> 03:27:27.524]  That's one option.
[03:27:27.524 --> 03:27:29.666]  The other option is to privatize the police.
[03:27:29.666 --> 03:27:34.489]  That means the poor, the middle class, you won't have police because you can't afford it.
[03:27:34.489 --> 03:27:37.151]  But the gated communities, they'll have police.
[03:27:37.151 --> 03:27:40.433]  The politicians, they'll have taxpayer-funded police.
[03:27:40.433 --> 03:27:41.434]  They won't even have to pay for it.
[03:27:41.434 --> 03:27:42.355]  It'll be funded by you.
[03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:45.041]  I mean, Cori Bush is literally saying that.
[03:27:45.041 --> 03:27:46.441]  Again, none of this is speculation.
[03:27:46.441 --> 03:27:50.323]  None of this is like, ah, doomsday, here's what, no, no.
[03:27:50.323 --> 03:27:51.523]  I'm just telling you what's happening.
[03:27:51.523 --> 03:27:54.825]  I'm just telling you what's actually going on right now.
[03:27:54.825 --> 03:27:58.926]  And Representative Cori Bush is actively and telling you that she's doing this.
[03:27:58.926 --> 03:28:01.007]  She's defunding your police.
[03:28:01.007 --> 03:28:03.108]  She's taking the security away from your neighborhood.
[03:28:04.025 --> 03:28:07.147]  And she's surrounding herself with men with guns.
[03:28:07.147 --> 03:28:08.767]  That's just what they're doing.
[03:28:08.767 --> 03:28:09.768]  They want you to eat bugs.
[03:28:09.768 --> 03:28:11.589]  They want you to no longer have a car.
[03:28:11.589 --> 03:28:12.909]  They don't want you to own a home.
[03:28:12.909 --> 03:28:19.833]  John Kerry, however, and his family have taken 16 trips this year alone in their private jet.
[03:28:21.112 --> 03:28:22.633]  Again, he's the climate czar.
[03:28:22.633 --> 03:28:32.117]  He's the one going around literally telling us that we're not allowed to drive, that we shouldn't be able to buy gasoline vehicles or, you know, eat meat, right?
[03:28:32.117 --> 03:28:36.299]  Eat bugs, eat the chemical stew that, you know, we pretend looks like meat.
[03:28:36.299 --> 03:28:41.762]  Meanwhile, 17 trips in his family's private jet, one of which was to go pick up an award
[03:28:43.163 --> 03:28:44.863]  His work with climate change.
[03:28:44.863 --> 03:28:45.544]  Truly incredible.
[03:28:45.544 --> 03:28:59.206]  And then of course you have Jeff Bezos, who is telling you to eat cockroaches for the sake of climate change, while he takes a vanity spaceship ride above the atmosphere for an Instagram selfie using 100 times the gasoline for a cross-country trip.
[03:28:59.206 --> 03:29:06.228]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:29:06.228 --> 03:29:11.569]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:29:11.749 --> 03:29:19.612]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:29:19.612 --> 03:29:21.073]  Humanity is strong.
[03:29:21.073 --> 03:29:22.033]  We're incredible.
[03:29:22.033 --> 03:29:25.815]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:29:25.815 --> 03:29:28.276]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:29:28.276 --> 03:29:34.599]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:29:34.599 --> 03:29:39.821]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential.
[03:29:39.821 --> 03:29:40.181]  Thank you.
[03:30:00.953 --> 03:30:02.714]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:30:02.714 --> 03:30:03.194]  You're on the air.
[03:30:03.194 --> 03:30:03.754]  Thanks for holding.
[03:30:03.754 --> 03:30:04.034]  Hey, hello.
[03:30:04.034 --> 03:30:04.795]  Can you hear me?
[03:30:04.795 --> 03:30:05.435]  I sure can, sir.
[03:30:05.435 --> 03:30:05.775]  Thank you.
[03:30:05.775 --> 03:30:06.515]  Hey, Alex.
[03:30:06.515 --> 03:30:09.716]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[03:30:09.716 --> 03:30:12.738]  And it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:30:12.738 --> 03:30:14.078]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:30:14.078 --> 03:30:15.959]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut.
[03:30:15.959 --> 03:30:18.200]  And I just want to plug in.
[03:30:18.200 --> 03:30:22.321]  I'm a truck driver and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[03:30:22.321 --> 03:30:25.563]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[03:30:25.563 --> 03:30:28.804]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[03:30:29.264 --> 03:30:38.032]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[03:30:38.032 --> 03:30:43.697]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[03:30:43.697 --> 03:30:45.979]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[03:30:45.979 --> 03:30:46.800]  He didn't want his name on it.
[03:30:46.920 --> 03:30:51.103]  Because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[03:30:51.103 --> 03:30:55.146]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[03:30:55.146 --> 03:30:56.908]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[03:30:56.908 --> 03:30:57.648]  So that means a lot to me.
[03:30:57.648 --> 03:30:59.009]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[03:30:59.009 --> 03:31:01.011]  We love you.
[03:31:01.011 --> 03:31:09.017]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim.
[03:31:09.017 --> 03:31:15.703]  So you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[03:31:16.383 --> 03:31:24.570]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[03:31:24.570 --> 03:31:41.243]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of a sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[03:31:41.243 --> 03:31:44.626]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[03:31:45.206 --> 03:31:46.627]  So don't worship the Globalist.
[03:31:46.627 --> 03:31:48.309]  Don't worship the NFL.
[03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:50.171]  Don't worship all the things of the system.
[03:31:50.171 --> 03:31:51.912]  But worship the things of God.
[03:31:51.912 --> 03:31:53.594]  Because we're made by God.
[03:31:53.594 --> 03:31:55.296]  And appreciate your consciousness.
[03:31:55.296 --> 03:31:56.777]  And appreciate free speech.
[03:31:56.777 --> 03:31:57.938]  While you still have it.
[03:31:57.938 --> 03:31:58.719]  While you still have it.
[03:32:00.239 --> 03:32:06.286]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[03:32:06.286 --> 03:32:13.814]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[03:32:13.814 --> 03:32:16.116]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[03:32:16.116 --> 03:32:19.700]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[03:32:21.602 --> 03:32:29.784]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[03:32:29.784 --> 03:32:35.686]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[03:32:35.686 --> 03:32:46.409]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[03:32:46.409 --> 03:32:47.690]  Thank you and God bless.
[03:32:48.450 --> 03:32:54.876]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[03:32:54.876 --> 03:32:56.718]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:19.333 --> 03:33:21.734]  I won't let them get that off.
[03:33:21.734 --> 03:33:22.794]  You can't get that off.
[03:33:22.794 --> 03:33:28.215]  I'm going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do.
[03:33:28.215 --> 03:33:32.456]  There are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that.
[03:33:32.456 --> 03:33:38.838]  So if I end up spending $200,000, if I spend $10 more on it, you know what?
[03:33:38.838 --> 03:33:40.758]  I get to be here to do the work.
[03:33:40.758 --> 03:33:43.759]  So suck it up and defunding the police has to happen.
[03:33:43.759 --> 03:33:47.320]  We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets.
[03:33:47.779 --> 03:33:48.520]  Mm-hmm.
[03:33:48.520 --> 03:33:55.226]  Yep, they gotta defund the police, but use your tax dollars to protect themselves and surround themselves with massive amounts of armed security.
[03:33:55.226 --> 03:33:58.769]  That's neo-feudalism in a nutshell, right?
[03:33:58.769 --> 03:34:06.897]  You only get security, you only get privacy, you only get property if you can pay for it, and you can only pay for it if you serve the system, because the system is total.
[03:34:06.897 --> 03:34:07.938]  The system is everything.
[03:34:07.938 --> 03:34:11.061]  The system decides what you do and don't deserve.
[03:34:11.909 --> 03:34:12.749]  Really incredible.
[03:34:12.749 --> 03:34:15.050]  So that's what neo-feudalism looks like.
[03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:25.253]  Let's just take a trip down memory lane, shall we, and take a quick little jaunt through dystopian hell world that's being built up for us.
[03:34:25.253 --> 03:34:27.934]  Here's the story from earlier today.
[03:34:27.934 --> 03:34:31.655]  Apple to scan US iPhones for images of child sexual abuse.
[03:34:32.563 --> 03:34:45.254]  Apple unveiled plans to scan US iPhones for images of child sexual abuse, drawing applause from child protection groups, but raising concern among some security researchers that their system could be misused, including by governments looking to surveil their citizens.
[03:34:45.254 --> 03:34:46.915]  Well, you don't say.
[03:34:46.915 --> 03:34:49.678]  I guess that is what it could be used for, isn't it?
[03:34:49.678 --> 03:34:56.584]  The tool designed to detect known images of child sex abuse, called Neuralmatch, will scan images before they're uploaded to the iCloud.
[03:34:56.584 --> 03:34:57.765]  Before they're uploaded to the iCloud.
[03:34:58.405 --> 03:35:01.126]  If it finds a match, the image will be reviewed by a human.
[03:35:01.126 --> 03:35:07.869]  If child pornography is confirmed, the user's account will be disabled and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children notified.
[03:35:07.869 --> 03:35:17.453]  Separately, Apple plans to scan users' encrypted messages for sexually explicit content as a child safety measure, which has also alarmed privacy advocates.
[03:35:17.453 --> 03:35:20.655]  Should alarm every human being that they would, uh...
[03:35:22.293 --> 03:35:24.434]  Actually implement this, like not just talk about it.
[03:35:24.434 --> 03:35:28.755]  They're implementing it now and you are not going to be able to opt out of it as far as I understand.
[03:35:28.755 --> 03:35:32.536]  It'll be automatically uploaded to your phone whether you like it or not.
[03:35:32.536 --> 03:35:34.857]  Remember, you don't own anything.
[03:35:34.857 --> 03:35:36.357]  This is the world they're creating.
[03:35:36.357 --> 03:35:37.178]  You're going to rent your car.
[03:35:37.178 --> 03:35:37.958]  You're going to rent your house.
[03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:39.678]  You're going to rent your phone.
[03:35:39.678 --> 03:35:40.238]  What does that mean?
[03:35:40.238 --> 03:35:42.259]  That means they want to come into your house.
[03:35:42.259 --> 03:35:43.179]  They don't need your permission.
[03:35:43.179 --> 03:35:45.200]  They need your landlord's permission.
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:47.441]  If they want to break into your phone, they don't need your permission.
[03:35:47.441 --> 03:35:50.682]  They need the corporation who owns the phone's permission.
[03:35:50.682 --> 03:35:51.262]  If they want to
[03:35:52.527 --> 03:35:54.067]  Have your self-driving car?
[03:35:54.067 --> 03:35:57.128]  Go ahead and turn yourself in to the police station for wrong-think.
[03:35:57.128 --> 03:36:00.529]  Well, there's nothing you can do about that because it's not your car.
[03:36:00.529 --> 03:36:01.449]  You're renting that car.
[03:36:01.449 --> 03:36:03.170]  You're paying for that car piece by piece.
[03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:05.671]  So what are you going to do?
[03:36:05.671 --> 03:36:05.911]  Nothing.
[03:36:05.911 --> 03:36:07.831]  There's nothing you can do.
[03:36:07.831 --> 03:36:13.072]  Matthew Green, a top cryptology research at John Hopkins University.
[03:36:13.072 --> 03:36:14.533]  I'm sorry, cryptography research.
[03:36:15.615 --> 03:36:22.281]  Warned that the system could be used to frame innocent people by sending them seemingly innocuous images designed to trigger matches for child pornography.
[03:36:22.281 --> 03:36:25.524]  That could fool Apple's algorithm and alert law enforcement.
[03:36:25.524 --> 03:36:30.208]  Researchers have been able to do this pretty easily, he said, of the ability to trick such systems.
[03:36:30.208 --> 03:36:32.591]  Such systems, so far, utterly unreliable.
[03:36:33.211 --> 03:36:51.415]  Just as I was compiling these stories for today's program, I ran across the old story about Google's AI system that, just like this one from Apple, was scanning photos in order to try to determine what was pictured in the images, and they had to make big changes to it because it kept calling black people gorillas.
[03:36:51.415 --> 03:36:56.856]  Like, these things are not as good as they would need to be for this actually to be effective.
[03:36:56.856 --> 03:36:59.877]  Now what they say is that they're only going to be scanning phones for
[03:37:00.777 --> 03:37:01.238]  I don't know.
[03:37:18.356 --> 03:37:19.017]  Being done right.
[03:37:19.017 --> 03:37:32.972]  So they have the world's largest child pornography database there at Apple or whatever that they're going to basically scan and try to match images from that known database with images in your phone.
[03:37:32.972 --> 03:37:35.795]  Now, I'm not a technical expert.
[03:37:35.795 --> 03:37:36.495]  I'm not an engineer.
[03:37:37.608 --> 03:37:40.330]  I gotta think there's a better way to do this.
[03:37:40.330 --> 03:37:42.272]  Like this is so extreme.
[03:37:42.272 --> 03:37:43.453]  It's pretty outrageous.
[03:37:43.453 --> 03:37:48.177]  And look, just because it's on your phone doesn't mean the laws change at all.
[03:37:48.177 --> 03:37:48.477]  Right?
[03:37:48.477 --> 03:37:52.080]  They do if just Apple just does this and nobody does anything about it.
[03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:53.561]  And they're just like, yeah, we own your phone.
[03:37:53.561 --> 03:37:55.242]  We own all of your information.
[03:37:55.242 --> 03:37:56.083]  We'll look at it.
[03:37:56.083 --> 03:37:56.663]  We'll search it.
[03:37:56.663 --> 03:37:57.664]  We'll copy it.
[03:37:57.664 --> 03:37:59.786]  We'll show it to people that work for us.
[03:37:59.786 --> 03:38:01.487]  Like if they just do that, nobody stops them.
[03:38:01.487 --> 03:38:04.730]  Then I guess that is legal because nobody's preventing them from doing so.
[03:38:04.730 --> 03:38:07.072]  That's sort of the reality of of laws.
[03:38:07.072 --> 03:38:07.232]  It is.
[03:38:09.423 --> 03:38:14.148]  But what if they wanted to come into your house and look through your photo albums?
[03:38:14.148 --> 03:38:15.930]  Is this any different?
[03:38:15.930 --> 03:38:17.012]  No, it's not.
[03:38:17.012 --> 03:38:22.237]  Just because it's on a phone doesn't mean suddenly anybody who works at Apple has access to this.
[03:38:22.237 --> 03:38:24.240]  This is a total violation, a total overreach.
[03:38:26.010 --> 03:38:29.392]  Other abuses could include government surveillance of dissidents or protesters.
[03:38:29.392 --> 03:38:34.275]  What happens, this article asks, when the Chinese government says, here's a list of files that we want you to scan for?
[03:38:34.275 --> 03:38:35.616]  Green asks, does Apple say no?
[03:38:35.616 --> 03:38:38.438]  I hope they say no, but their technology won't say no.
[03:38:38.438 --> 03:38:40.820]  Well, the technology is there.
[03:38:40.820 --> 03:38:46.504]  Apple has already given all of its encryption keys over to China in exchange for being able to build their
[03:38:47.858 --> 03:38:48.338]  I think so.
[03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:10.411]  Okay, you can do it now.
[03:39:21.242 --> 03:39:27.204]  Tim Cook of Apple gave a speech where he talked about kicking off people like Alex Jones off of their devices.
[03:39:27.204 --> 03:39:28.564]  Off of the internet entirely.
[03:39:28.564 --> 03:39:29.724]  And he said it's a sin.
[03:39:29.724 --> 03:39:32.465]  It's a sin to let these people on our platform.
[03:39:32.465 --> 03:39:38.387]  It's a sin to let people like Alex Jones speak freely because he tells people what we're up to.
[03:39:38.387 --> 03:39:39.707]  But no, no, it's just a sin.
[03:39:39.707 --> 03:39:42.348]  It's a sin to allow this type of material.
[03:39:42.348 --> 03:39:45.209]  He didn't say it was a sin to allow child pornography.
[03:39:45.209 --> 03:39:48.209]  He didn't say it was a sin to allow hardcore pornography.
[03:39:48.209 --> 03:39:49.570]  He didn't say it was a sin to allow
[03:39:50.310 --> 03:39:55.994]  You know, drug culture or any other incredibly damaging, you know, aspects of our culture.
[03:39:55.994 --> 03:39:58.416]  No, no, it was about Alex Jones.
[03:39:58.416 --> 03:40:00.838]  It was about people speaking up for freedom and liberty.
[03:40:00.838 --> 03:40:11.246]  See, they could have done a lot of things to solve these, these little issues of child pornography being shared on all of these sites to a massive degree, but they're not that interested in that.
[03:40:11.246 --> 03:40:16.510]  No, no, but they're very, very interested, very concerned about shutting down your freedom of speech.
[03:40:17.335 --> 03:40:18.035]  Right?
[03:40:18.035 --> 03:40:19.777]  You can post whatever you want to Twitter.
[03:40:19.777 --> 03:40:20.537]  It goes right through.
[03:40:20.537 --> 03:40:25.280]  I mean, there's been some awful stuff on Twitter that is actually illegal.
[03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:25.861]  That's just up there.
[03:40:25.861 --> 03:40:29.363]  It stays up there for days and days and days.
[03:40:29.363 --> 03:40:31.064]  I mean, the porno sites are even worse, right?
[03:40:31.064 --> 03:40:32.045]  But they're all supported by
[03:40:33.117 --> 03:40:33.477]  Big Tech.
[03:40:33.477 --> 03:40:36.559]  You can still download their apps at the App Store, right?
[03:40:36.559 --> 03:40:46.046]  Even though they've been caught and sued and had people actually reach out and say, hey, this is an image of, this is a video of me from when I was underage that was taken illegally.
[03:40:46.046 --> 03:40:47.067]  Please take it down.
[03:40:47.067 --> 03:40:48.107]  And they don't take it down.
[03:40:48.107 --> 03:40:49.028]  They just leave it up.
[03:40:49.028 --> 03:40:49.829]  Now they're being sued for that.
[03:40:49.829 --> 03:40:52.871]  So, they're still allowed on the App Store, right?
[03:40:52.871 --> 03:40:55.232]  They're still allowed to be present in all these.
[03:40:55.232 --> 03:40:57.054]  It's not a sin to kick them off.
[03:40:57.054 --> 03:40:59.235]  Or to keep them on, rather.
[03:40:59.235 --> 03:41:00.576]  But no, they can be doing anything.
[03:41:00.576 --> 03:41:01.637]  Meanwhile, Netflix is like,
[03:41:03.243 --> 03:41:07.325]  Making the movie Cuties, which is just like pretty much literally child pornography.
[03:41:07.325 --> 03:41:09.446]  So this is the way it's going, right?
[03:41:09.446 --> 03:41:17.789]  Many companies made record profits during COVID-19 pandemic and an advocacy group is calling on many of them to stop allowing child exploitation to be part of their bottom line.
[03:41:17.789 --> 03:41:19.010]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:41:19.010 --> 03:41:20.150]  They don't want to.
[03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:25.513]  They're going to keep doing this, but they do know that if they want to massively encroach on your privacy,
[03:41:26.033 --> 03:41:37.620]  If they want to spy in real time on your photos before it even gets uploaded to the cloud, then they've got to have something that they know the public will actually allow them to justify this insane behavior with.
[03:41:37.620 --> 03:41:43.023]  So, of course, they choose child pornography as that particular topic.
[03:41:43.023 --> 03:41:50.307]  Folks, I want you to really understand where this is headed and what it means that big tech is now
[03:41:51.539 --> 03:42:10.960]  Intimately involved with our government from the federal to the local level that they not only Essentially hold veto power over anybody running for our government if they don't like you they'll delete your account They'll delete your ability to reach out over Twitter or Facebook or any other social media platform Which is the primary way people communicate these days
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:17.505]  Meaning they can completely neuter, completely destroy your entire campaign before it even leaves the barn.
[03:42:17.505 --> 03:42:18.406]  They can do that.
[03:42:18.406 --> 03:42:20.788]  They essentially have veto power over who we have representing us.
[03:42:20.788 --> 03:42:22.089]  But it's not just that.
[03:42:22.089 --> 03:42:28.193]  The number of people that intermingle between big tech and the government is truly astonishing.
[03:42:28.193 --> 03:42:34.358]  People moving back and forth between the FBI and Facebook or Twitter and the Biden administration.
[03:42:34.358 --> 03:42:38.121]  They're all intimately intertwined.
[03:42:38.121 --> 03:42:40.183]  An incestuous cabal.
[03:42:41.508 --> 03:42:48.833]  of psychopath control freaks with their finger on the nuclear trigger and on your phone.
[03:42:48.833 --> 03:42:54.557]  What that looks like and where that's headed is all in this stack and I'll get to that in the final segment on the other side.
[03:42:54.557 --> 03:42:55.818]  Don't go anywhere folks, we'll be right back.
[03:42:58.820 --> 03:43:05.425]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[03:44:59.787 --> 03:45:07.972]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:45:07.972 --> 03:45:16.737]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:45:16.737 --> 03:45:23.682]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at infowarestore.com.

[03:47:15.685 --> 03:47:17.127]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.127 --> 03:47:17.848]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[03:47:17.848 --> 03:47:20.772]  I'm the host of the American Journal 8 to 11 a.m.
[03:47:20.772 --> 03:47:22.855]  every day here on InfoWars.com.
[03:47:22.855 --> 03:47:29.303]  So let's talk about what a world designed by big tech really looks like.
[03:47:29.303 --> 03:47:31.887]  First of all, this story from August 3rd, just a few days ago.
[03:47:32.881 --> 03:47:34.984]  Want a $10 credit from Amazon?
[03:47:34.984 --> 03:47:36.066]  Well, yeah, sure.
[03:47:36.066 --> 03:47:38.489]  Well, just let it scan your palm.
[03:47:38.489 --> 03:47:39.110]  Oh, never mind.
[03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:40.492]  No, thank you.
[03:47:40.492 --> 03:47:44.357]  No, I'd rather not have you scan my palm for a pittance.
[03:47:45.387 --> 03:47:46.208]  You weirdos.
[03:47:46.208 --> 03:47:51.711]  Amazon is offering store credit in exchange for customers submitting a digital scan of their palm, according to reports.
[03:47:51.711 --> 03:48:02.818]  The e-commerce company in 2020 introduced biometric palm print scanners in some of its brick-and-mortar stores, allowing registered shoppers to pay for goods by waving their hand over the devices.
[03:48:02.818 --> 03:48:08.041]  I gotta say, that kind of makes sense, actually.
[03:48:08.041 --> 03:48:09.422]  I can't do it.
[03:48:09.422 --> 03:48:09.942]  I can't do it.
[03:48:09.942 --> 03:48:12.003]  Just imagine what it would look like paying for something like that.
[03:48:14.605 --> 03:48:19.709]  See, when corporations and the government combine together, it's what we call fascism.
[03:48:19.709 --> 03:48:28.656]  So when I reach out to scan my palm print, I think you get an image of what it might look like.
[03:48:28.656 --> 03:48:31.598]  Like a salute, sort of, in a way.
[03:48:31.598 --> 03:48:39.464]  So this is one step towards this all-encompassing total control grid of Amazon.
[03:48:39.464 --> 03:48:41.766]  But let's expand a little bit farther out as we go to the Washington Post.
[03:48:43.447 --> 03:48:46.293]  I'm sorry, let's go into the insider.
[03:48:46.293 --> 03:48:49.779]  Facebook and Amazon are so big they're creating their own company towns.
[03:48:51.718 --> 03:48:54.440]  So Facebook and Amazon are actually building towns.
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:48:56.302]  So this is the vision of the future.
[03:48:56.302 --> 03:49:00.285]  The vision of the future is you'll work at a company that owns your town.
[03:49:00.285 --> 03:49:01.306]  That means they own your home.
[03:49:01.306 --> 03:49:03.608]  That means you're renting your home from your company.
[03:49:03.608 --> 03:49:11.034]  They own the store that you go to, meaning the wages that you're paid are then returned directly to the company to pay for the goods that you need to buy.
[03:49:11.034 --> 03:49:14.577]  The car that you drive will likely also be rented from that company.
[03:49:14.577 --> 03:49:15.198]  With Amazon,
[03:49:16.601 --> 03:49:16.661]  I'm
[03:49:36.755 --> 03:49:53.664]  That you actually learn about the world for, the car that you drive, the phone that you have in your pocket, all of your information, your computer, your house, everything will be owned by the company that you work for, making you essentially an indentured servant, a member of a company town.
[03:49:53.664 --> 03:49:54.765]  That's literally what it is.
[03:49:54.765 --> 03:49:59.608]  And let's just understand real quick how big Amazon is.
[03:50:00.808 --> 03:50:03.591]  Amazon now employs more than 1 million people.
[03:50:03.591 --> 03:50:09.057]  They added 400,000 jobs in 2020 alone.
[03:50:09.057 --> 03:50:11.900]  Now, this article is from October of 2020.
[03:50:11.900 --> 03:50:14.002]  Since then, they've grown even more.
[03:50:14.002 --> 03:50:18.707]  One out of every 153 American workers is an Amazon employee.
[03:50:19.898 --> 03:50:29.266]  In other words, if this trajectory continues, by the end of this year, about 1% of all of America will be employed by Amazon.
[03:50:29.266 --> 03:50:33.049]  Now, what is it like to be employed by Amazon?
[03:50:33.049 --> 03:50:34.650]  I don't think you need me to answer this.
[03:50:34.650 --> 03:50:36.872]  I think you know what it's like to be employed by Amazon.
[03:50:36.872 --> 03:50:39.294]  I think it's a heck of a lot like slavery.
[03:50:39.294 --> 03:50:47.962]  Let's read some stories about how Amazon treats their workers and understand that if the cancer continues to grow,
[03:50:49.468 --> 03:50:52.469]  More and more percentage of America will be under Amazon.
[03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:59.111]  Amazon will own more and more of the things that it then rents back to you for the wages that it pays you.
[03:50:59.111 --> 03:51:05.053]  But only if you're lucky enough to work for Amazon because, as this headline points out, you might get fired by a robot.
[03:51:05.053 --> 03:51:06.654]  Amazon employee fired by robot.
[03:51:06.654 --> 03:51:10.535]  It's you versus the machine's algorithm.
[03:51:10.535 --> 03:51:16.717]  As a 63-year-old Army veteran was fired by a machine for having not done his job properly despite the fact that
[03:51:18.117 --> 03:51:22.681]  The reason he couldn't deliver the packages he was slated to deliver were out of his control.
[03:51:22.681 --> 03:51:28.505]  It was things like locked apartment complexes and traffic that he couldn't control.
[03:51:28.505 --> 03:51:32.168]  And yet, now he's been fired by a machine.
[03:51:32.168 --> 03:51:39.353]  No one to appeal to, no human involved in the decision process, just an algorithm firing you from your job.
[03:51:39.353 --> 03:51:40.955]  And of course, the opposite is also true.
[03:51:40.955 --> 03:51:47.440]  I saw a post on Twitter a little while ago that was a legit post where somebody like, I was blessed by the algorithm today.
[03:51:48.120 --> 03:51:53.743]  They're like, you know, I got up and there's a really good song playing on my Spotify list.
[03:51:53.743 --> 03:51:57.566]  And then I got in my car and it led me around the traffic.
[03:51:57.566 --> 03:52:04.730]  And then I, you know, I'm an Uber driver, so it gave me really good and profitable rides to give to people.
[03:52:04.730 --> 03:52:10.094]  And then this is, you know, and so, I mean, when you talk about an AI God, if you're living in a company town,
[03:52:11.038 --> 03:52:29.044]  And you're working off an app on your phone, and your hours and your pay is all determined by robots, and they can actually slightly tweak it to where the more they approve of you, the better job you have, the easier, you know, the gigs that you have to work are, the less work you have to do, the more money you get paid, I mean, literally, you worship the algorithm.
[03:52:29.044 --> 03:52:33.425]  And that's what this Twitter post was like, you know, praise the algorithm, they blessed me today!
[03:52:33.425 --> 03:52:38.426]  It's real, it's serious, and this is really where we're going.
[03:52:38.426 --> 03:52:39.867]  Moving away from Amazon, what about Facebook?
[03:52:40.865 --> 03:52:41.766]  Welcome to your new dystopia.
[03:52:41.766 --> 03:52:42.867]  Welcome to Facebook Town.
[03:52:42.867 --> 03:52:44.349]  Smile or you're fired, right?
[03:52:53.618 --> 03:53:01.321]  More than a dozen former Facebook employees detailed how the company's leadership and performance review system created a culture where any dissent is discouraged.
[03:53:01.321 --> 03:53:12.045]  Employees say Facebook's stack-ranking performance review system drives employees to push out products and features that drive user engagement without fully considering potential long-term negative impacts on user experience or privacy.
[03:53:12.045 --> 03:53:18.867]  Reliance on peer review creates an underlying pressure for Facebook employees to forge friendships with colleagues for the sake of career advancement.
[03:53:20.663 --> 03:53:23.624]  Sounds like dystopian hell to me, quite frankly.
[03:53:23.624 --> 03:53:25.785]  To be honest with you, just horrific.
[03:53:25.785 --> 03:53:27.265]  Pretend to be happy all the time, right?
[03:53:27.265 --> 03:53:31.027]  Like if you're sad, then you're being mean to the company, so you'll be punished.
[03:53:31.027 --> 03:53:31.847]  It's just communism.
[03:53:31.847 --> 03:53:36.309]  It's, I mean, this is, you recognize this mentality around the entire country right now.
[03:53:37.329 --> 03:53:37.549]  I don't
[03:53:57.080 --> 03:54:01.801]  Agitate for better pay, better benefits, whatever it is.
[03:54:01.801 --> 03:54:06.502]  Well, Amazon spends a lot of money and a lot of AI on how to prevent that from happening.
[03:54:06.502 --> 03:54:11.823]  One of the things they discovered is that the more diverse your workforce is, the less likely it is to unionize.
[03:54:11.823 --> 03:54:25.946]  So they'll push diversity for the explicit purpose of causing lower social cohesion, which means there's a less likely chance that the SERFs, the little people down below, get together, team up, and actually apply pressure to the people above them.
[03:54:27.165 --> 03:54:31.326]  So, you can expect Facebook Town and Amazon Town to be very diverse.
[03:54:31.326 --> 03:54:37.507]  It'll be a very diverse massive surveillance system scanning you and watching you all the time with thermal cameras.
[03:54:37.507 --> 03:54:45.088]  You know, because the more diverse you are, the less you get along, the less you cooperate, and the less threat you pose to your over-rulers.
[03:54:45.088 --> 03:54:45.568]  What about this?
[03:54:45.568 --> 03:54:47.909]  Amazon wants a key to your business and your garage.
[03:54:47.909 --> 03:54:49.849]  Why security experts urge caution.
[03:54:49.849 --> 03:54:50.649]  Oh, I can tell you why.
[03:54:50.649 --> 03:54:54.410]  It's because they want you to give them a key to your house and their garage.
[03:54:56.518 --> 03:54:58.759]  Gee, what's wrong with that?
[03:54:58.759 --> 03:55:04.163]  Okay, it's pretty obvious, but again, they wouldn't even have to ask if you don't own your house, right?
[03:55:04.163 --> 03:55:14.009]  And BlackRock is involved in buying up massive swaths of houses in order to rent them back to people, meaning you don't own it, meaning you don't have a right to say who does and does not enter into your abode.
[03:55:14.009 --> 03:55:17.291]  No, they'll enter, whether you like it or not.
[03:55:17.291 --> 03:55:20.954]  Former FBI officials tapped for Amazon's growing security apparatus, so
[03:55:22.113 --> 03:55:25.978]  You know, they'll have the most high-tech security surveillance and everything.
[03:55:25.978 --> 03:55:32.225]  Amazon delivery drivers forced to sign biometric consent form or lose their job.
[03:55:32.225 --> 03:55:40.616]  We can always just get another job, you know, unless Amazon has a total monopoly over the entire economy, in which case you're signing the damn form, right?
[03:55:41.621 --> 03:55:45.922]  Amazon warehouse organizers allege a year of retaliation.
[03:55:45.922 --> 03:55:47.043]  See, they wanted to unionize.
[03:55:47.043 --> 03:55:48.383]  They wanted slightly better pay.
[03:55:48.383 --> 03:55:50.224]  They wanted not to be fired by robots.
[03:55:50.224 --> 03:55:53.725]  They wanted to not have to pee in bottles while they were out doing deliveries.
[03:55:53.725 --> 03:56:08.669]  They wanted to not have a situation where instead of buying air conditioning so that people did not pass out while working on the warehouse floor, Amazon decided it was more cost-effective to just park an ambulance outside and wait for people to pass out and then treat them afterwards.
[03:56:08.669 --> 03:56:09.490]  Horrific.
[03:56:09.490 --> 03:56:10.030]  Anti-human.
[03:56:10.590 --> 03:56:18.996]  Totally brutal, and if you try to organize, then the entire company will crush you, come down on you, and try to destroy your life.
[03:56:18.996 --> 03:56:20.137]  These companies are not good.
[03:56:20.137 --> 03:56:22.579]  Like, I don't know how many more stories I have to read.
[03:56:22.579 --> 03:56:39.612]  I'll read more, but just, bottom line, bottom story, these big tech companies that are now, you know, imposing themselves, putting themselves, usurping the government's power, usurping your own power, saying, we're in charge, we will dictate how you live your life, what you're allowed to say, who you're allowed to vote for, are awful people.
[03:56:41.698 --> 03:56:46.619]  Who, when they have an iota of power, use it to destroy anybody that stands up against them.
[03:56:46.619 --> 03:56:48.280]  And we see it time and time again.
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:48.860]  What about this?
[03:56:48.860 --> 03:56:51.621]  Amazon enables sidewalk network on millions of devices.
[03:56:51.621 --> 03:56:52.481]  You thought it was your device?
[03:56:52.481 --> 03:56:53.482]  No, it's Amazon's device.
[03:56:53.482 --> 03:56:55.082]  It's Amazon's network.
[03:56:55.082 --> 03:56:56.242]  You're just on it.
[03:56:56.242 --> 03:57:03.325]  Doorbell camera firm Ring has partnered with 2,000 police firms across the United States.
[03:57:03.325 --> 03:57:05.305]  Again, just solidifying the great merger.
[03:57:05.305 --> 03:57:10.667]  And of course you have all of the stories of listening in to devices even when it's not
[03:57:13.035 --> 03:57:16.856]  You know, even when they're not allowed to, or you don't say, OK Google, or, you know, Alexa, or whatever.
[03:57:16.856 --> 03:57:19.377]  They have all the medical records, by the way.
[03:57:19.377 --> 03:57:20.857]  I don't know if you know that.
[03:57:20.857 --> 03:57:23.658]  Project Nightingale with Google got all your medical records.
[03:57:23.658 --> 03:57:28.579]  AWS also has what they call a lake of medical records.
[03:57:28.579 --> 03:57:29.599]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:57:29.599 --> 03:57:29.959]  What is this?
[03:57:29.959 --> 03:57:33.280]  Google Drive takes down users' personal copy of Plandemic.
[03:57:33.280 --> 03:57:37.021]  So even your files, if they're stored on the cloud, they'll be deleted.
[03:57:37.021 --> 03:57:41.842]  So just total surveillance, total control, total subjugation, and yet,
[03:57:43.103 --> 03:57:47.286]  In this cult-like atmosphere, you have to pretend like you're happy, or you'll be fired.
[03:57:47.286 --> 03:57:48.667]  It's dystopia, and it's coming.
[03:57:48.667 --> 03:57:52.831]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[03:57:52.831 --> 03:57:56.934]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[03:57:56.934 --> 03:57:59.256]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[03:57:59.256 --> 03:58:04.040]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[03:58:04.040 --> 03:58:07.483]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[03:58:08.163 --> 03:58:16.689]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.

[03:58:49.713 --> 03:58:52.174]  The world is awakening.
[03:58:52.174 --> 03:58:55.675]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[03:58:55.675 --> 03:59:06.979]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[03:59:06.979 --> 03:59:09.580]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[03:59:10.779 --> 03:59:16.746]  The truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[03:59:16.746 --> 03:59:19.889]  We have forced them out in the open.
[03:59:19.889 --> 03:59:25.716]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[03:59:25.716 --> 03:59:27.698]  You've got to trust in the plan of God.
[03:59:27.978 --> 03:59:29.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
