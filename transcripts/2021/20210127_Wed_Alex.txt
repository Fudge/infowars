[00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:23.094]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this January 27th, 2021 Wednesday broadcast.
[00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:34.163]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to have the founder of the Boogaloo Boys joining us coming up on the broadcast today.
[00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:35.664]  That is in the second hour.
[00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:36.645]  I appreciate Mr. Dunn
[00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:43.750]  Coming on after I've said some critical things of his group, he says to set the record straight.
[00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.234]  So I look forward to that, because who's going to know more about the Boogaloos than the founder of the Boogaloos?
[00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:52.615]  So I'm really looking forward to that interview coming up.
[00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.577]  Owen Schroeder is going to be riding shotgun with me here.
[00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:57.858]  He'll be here for the next three, four hours.
[00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.080]  I'll be gone in two hours.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.381]  Wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.722]  So much important news unfolding.
[00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:06.044]  Roger Stone has been quiet the last few weeks.
[00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:09.886]  I said that he's not ready to go on air until he has something big to say.
[00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:16.291]  Well, he texted me this morning and I called him and he is on the show with big news.
[00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:21.554]  I'll leave it at that at 1130 Central tomorrow.
[00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:26.678]  Roger's not been doing interviews really because he doesn't want the media lying about him.
[00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:30.060]  He's just so overwhelmed the level of lies they tell about him.
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.923]  Them sending a SWAT team to his hotel room on the day of the Capitol
[00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.634]  I don't know.
[00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:51.278]  Tomorrow.
[00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.879]  And yes, folks, they sent a SWAT team to the hotel we were staying at.
[00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.760]  They tried to get me too.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.960]  Then I guess later figured out that I actually tried to stop the riot.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:09.504]  But that's the level of the media's disinfo, is that they sent SWAT teams for us until they later found out that we had not instigated the Capitol event.
[00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.565]  So again, Roger will be talking about the impeachment trial.
[00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:25.282]  That starts on the 8th against President Trump, and there's a very, very important video posted to Bandot Video that has the headline, proof President Trump did not incite the riot.
[00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:27.985]  But I think that's not even a strong enough headline.
[00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:31.268]  I think we're going to change it to must watch.
[00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:36.233]  InfoWars security team lays out what really happened at the U.S.
[00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:37.034]  Capitol January 6th.
[00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:45.208]  We've gone ahead and gotten a whole timeline together and broken down exactly who did what, when.
[00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:50.430]  But there it is, exclusive proof Trump did not incite the Capitol riot.
[00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.891]  And so many people have moved on from Trump.
[00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.711]  They're like, well, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.252]  He's out of office.
[00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.213]  Who cares if he gets in trouble?
[00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:57.794]  If they're able to hang the fraud,
[00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:02.620]  around the president's neck that he incited this on purpose.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:12.166]  They're able to pass this legislation that's five times worse than the Patriot Act against the American people where they say they're going to use the Pentagon and the CIA against the American people.
[00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:13.267]  Now that doesn't scare me.
[00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:17.550]  Actually, that makes me mad and it makes me understand that I guess they want a violent revolution.
[00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.013]  They're probably going to get one because there certainly have done enough to warrant a revolution.
[00:03:23.013 --> 00:03:25.075]  The problem is they're going to stage false flags.
[00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:26.484]  I don't know.
[00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:55.445]  I've had my ass handed to me more than once, like the Capitol.
[00:03:55.445 --> 00:04:04.267]  Our biggest triumph, a million people peacefully so they'd have a 10-day investigation, and then a couple hundred antifa and others take it all away from us, and I should have known they would do something like that.
[00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:06.527]  I should have known, but I didn't.
[00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:14.989]  And so those of you out there that are like, oh, let's just have a violent revolution, you're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it.
[00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.510]  You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.517]  You know, take the Boogaloos.
[00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:26.223]  They said, and I'm going to ask Mr. Dunn about this, that they were going to have an armed march the weekend after the 6th.
[00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:28.445]  But if you just have an armed march in D.C., they'll arrest you for that.
[00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:29.967]  You can say, well, it's my Second Amendment.
[00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.269]  They'll still arrest you.
[00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:35.953]  And so then, we didn't see the Boogaloos show up armed.
[00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:37.654]  Were they helping other people?
[00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:37.994]  I don't know.
[00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:44.651]  I just don't like this thing of, let's have violent revolution, and then people say, okay, well you go first.
[00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:52.176]  Well, I'm not going first, and even if I could get somebody else to be violent, I don't want to sit back and watch that happen, because I don't like playing God.
[00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:55.118]  The globalists, though, are starting it, and they'll probably get what they want.
[00:04:55.118 --> 00:05:00.160]  So all of you that want a big, bloody revolution, you want to get some TheResistance.Video.
[00:05:01.422 --> 00:05:03.846]  The Resistance not video.
[00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:06.071]  The Resistance not video.
[00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.513]  The Resistance not video.
[00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:10.419]  The Resistance not video.
[00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.162]  The Resistance not video.
[00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:22.260]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Ban.Video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.944]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:31.406]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:36.830]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.772]  TheResistance.Video.
[00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:43.235]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[00:05:43.235 --> 00:05:53.824]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.Video.
[00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:54.764]  Share the link.
[00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:56.346]  TheResistance.Video.
[00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:57.447]  TheResistance.Video.
[00:06:02.092 --> 00:06:03.794]  Big Brother.
[00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:06.117]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:07.918]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:09.981]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:12.143]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:16.828]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:30.908]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Wednesday, 27th day of January 2021.
[00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:37.572]  Coming up in 11 days, the trial of the 45th President of the United States begins in the U.S.
[00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.173]  Senate.
[00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:43.376]  A impeachment in the House is only an indictment.
[00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:46.258]  Impeachment in the House is only an indictment.
[00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:48.980]  So what they did last year in January is nothing.
[00:06:49.787 --> 00:07:01.253]  What they're starting up again this January in the House that they passed last week is something because it's an actual trial for the President supposedly inciting that crowd.
[00:07:01.253 --> 00:07:03.074]  Well, I was there.
[00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:12.199]  I worked with five other organizations to organize legal, lawful, peaceful events with the Secret Service, metal detectors, and porta-potties.
[00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:18.632]  And that's what the President wanted and he said repeatedly, we're going to peacefully march, his son said that.
[00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:36.444]  And so to say that his rhetoric that isn't one-tenth as aggressive as the Democrats, burn it all down, civil war, New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, go to their houses, go get in their faces, Pelosi saying burning down buildings is just what people do, their rhetoric is at least ten times what the Republican rhetoric has been.
[00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:40.904]  The idea that Republicans want to burn things down and blow things up.
[00:07:40.904 --> 00:07:44.227]  But regardless, this is the trial of the President.
[00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:45.888]  And I think he should be there.
[00:07:45.888 --> 00:07:46.969]  I think he should testify.
[00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:51.853]  And this is really Trump's chance to turn the tide.
[00:07:51.853 --> 00:07:56.837]  And instead of having his tail between his legs, go in there and just lay out the facts.
[00:07:56.837 --> 00:07:58.919]  Exhibit 1, here I am saying don't be violent.
[00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:02.401]  Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, I've had hundreds and hundreds of rallies that are peaceful.
[00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:03.963]  Exhibit 4, here's all these Democrats.
[00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:12.688]  Including Nancy Pelosi calling for violence at Maxine Waters and calling for killing Trump and killing his supporters and show a montage of Trump supporters being attacked.
[00:08:12.688 --> 00:08:16.149]  Because he's going to be able to show his video.
[00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:20.431]  And then, hey, call me up before the Senate in the trial.
[00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.412]  Call up the other organizations and groups that were there.
[00:08:23.412 --> 00:08:31.334]  And they'll sit there and point blank tell you why the hell would we want to storm a Capitol and ruin everything we were doing trying to point out that the election was fraudulent.
[00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:32.455]  Why would we want to discredit that?
[00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:36.465]  To make sure they ended up voting against having a 10-day investigation.
[00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:39.286]  It's called a motive, and the other side had the motive.
[00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:46.889]  And of course, that's why Antifun, other leftist control groups, took responsibility for breaking in, getting the police to attack the general crowd.
[00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:50.130]  Then people yelled, attack, get in, in a very small percentage.
[00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.151]  Not even one half of 1%.
[00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:56.493]  We had a million people there in D.C., a couple hundred thousand there at the Capitol.
[00:08:56.493 --> 00:09:01.094]  We're talking about less than 1% that actually went in there, and most of them between the velvet ropes.
[00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:02.435]  And notice it's all the velvet rope people
[00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:04.193]  That's
[00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:25.875]  Don't you think he gets all that now?
[00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:26.676]  It doesn't matter.
[00:09:26.676 --> 00:09:29.697]  They want to hurt him to associate it with all of us.
[00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:33.978]  He is now a symbol of America and populist resistance.
[00:09:33.978 --> 00:09:35.898]  And if you don't get that, you don't get anything.
[00:09:35.898 --> 00:09:38.399]  And all I get is persecution.
[00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:43.561]  I've been told, you know, a year ago, two years ago, come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:47.322]  Come out against President Trump and all your problems will be over and you'll get money.
[00:09:49.502 --> 00:09:50.943]  Now, those are off-record meetings.
[00:09:50.943 --> 00:09:56.486]  I can't say who, but I'm sure people can add 2 plus 2 and know what number it comes up with.
[00:09:56.486 --> 00:09:57.987]  But I signed non-disclosures and everything!
[00:09:57.987 --> 00:10:00.288]  You understand?
[00:10:00.288 --> 00:10:02.390]  With multiple globalist power groups.
[00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.385]  Trying to get me to stop.
[00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:12.710]  And almost everybody else takes the money because they go, hey, I got a carrot and I got a stick.
[00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.315]  So there's all these fools that go on and go, Jones is defending Trump because he makes money off of it.
[00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:25.180]  Yeah, if you think 50 Democrat lawsuits are getting deplatformed, your bank account's taken and PayPal taken away and it's kicked off everything.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.802]  Oh man, it's wonderful.
[00:10:27.802 --> 00:10:31.005]  It's so good to stand up for Trump.
[00:10:32.563 --> 00:10:47.318]  But regardless, Trump made a lot of mistakes, and now he's losing his bank accounts, he's lost his YouTube, he's lost over 60 other platforms, so he can be silenced, listen to this, silenced ahead of and during his trial.
[00:10:47.318 --> 00:10:50.821]  And I guarantee they're saying, oh, let the president's lawyers put on the defense.
[00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:52.883]  No.
[00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:53.864]  Put Trump in there.
[00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:59.713]  Put Trump in there on the witness seat and let them attack him and lie about him.
[00:10:59.713 --> 00:11:07.299]  And all he's got to do is have a hit list of exhibits after they attack him that he puts on and it will destroy them.
[00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.681]  Right out of a Perry Mason movie.
[00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:16.908]  Or right out of the real footage of the famous House Committee on Un-American Activities.
[00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:21.531]  And then the Senate Committee on Un-American Activities and the lawyer says, have you no decency?
[00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:22.773]  You know, just that point.
[00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:28.502]  And I mean, I could go into that Senate trial and annihilate them.
[00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:30.424]  Annihilate them.
[00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:31.646]  This is their Waterloo.
[00:11:31.646 --> 00:11:34.729]  But of course, they're always the aggressive globalists.
[00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:35.951]  We always cower to them.
[00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:38.454]  We always act like we're the bad guys and we're on the defense.
[00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:44.334]  The answer is offense, offense, offense, offense, offense.
[00:11:44.334 --> 00:11:56.766]  We have giant banking cartels that are foreign-owned, that own big tech, that are now systematically shutting down tens of millions of Americans with AI, surveilling us and censoring us as a political class.
[00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:01.331]  They're saying they want to arrest us and re-educate us in camps.
[00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.532]  They're saying they want to kill us.
[00:12:03.493 --> 00:12:05.534]  They say they want to kill the President and his family.
[00:12:05.534 --> 00:12:12.255]  They have paramilitary thugs beating people up in the streets and shooting them in the head and burning down public housing.
[00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:16.056]  We have Joe Biden on TV saying, I don't even know what I'm signing.
[00:12:16.056 --> 00:12:20.398]  And next he goes, I just banned saying China virus in the federal government.
[00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:22.558]  If it's in any document, it's illegal.
[00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:24.779]  And if you use a word, we're going to fire you.
[00:12:25.499 --> 00:12:28.040]  It's all naked insaneness.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.740]  And Fauci said, I do think it's important that we all wear two masks now.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.001]  Does everybody want to take the mask off?
[00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:33.961]  Oh, no, no.
[00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:34.661]  Two!
[00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:34.881]  Two!
[00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:36.461]  We got to inspect it to the right type.
[00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.702]  And, oh!
[00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:44.283]  Not to be outdone and make that sound unreasonable, now CNBC, AP, oh, actually, you need three masks.
[00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:45.563]  Just so happen I looked that up.
[00:12:45.563 --> 00:12:51.464]  With the different types of masks that are out there, depending on the type, one mask lowers your oxygen level about 20%.
[00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:53.465]  And oxygen is already a trace gas.
[00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:56.123]  Two masks lowers it even more.
[00:12:56.123 --> 00:13:10.429]  Three masks, I mean, hell, why not just get a noose, get a rope, put it over the rafters, put it on your neck, kick the stool, jump off the stool, and you will not transmit COVID anymore because your neck's going to break and you're going to asphyxiate, you're going to die.
[00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:16.892]  They're going to crap your britches and they're going to come in and they're going to cut you down and they're going to go put you in the ground somewhere.
[00:13:16.892 --> 00:13:17.632]  Please don't do that.
[00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:18.452]  I'm not being serious.
[00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:22.216]  That's the point we've reached.
[00:13:22.216 --> 00:13:24.437]  And again, this is too evil to fail.
[00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:25.958]  That's really the plan here.
[00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.978]  It's all about you're dirty, you're bad, you're evil.
[00:13:27.978 --> 00:13:33.300]  And now everyone I know knows someone that was old that took the COVID vaccine and died.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.500]  John Rappaport's been talking about this today.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.942]  He said 10 months ago, it's about targeting the old.
[00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.662]  And remember, the British ministry covered their ass a month and a half ago.
[00:13:40.662 --> 00:13:41.803]  They said, if you're over 75, don't take it.
[00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:44.822]  If you're under 16, don't take it.
[00:13:44.822 --> 00:13:46.623]  And if you're pregnant, don't take it.
[00:13:46.623 --> 00:13:47.884]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:47.884 --> 00:13:56.530]  The billboards and the doctors at the NIH here and the National Health Service in England, they all say the same thing.
[00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.992]  Whether it's Australia, the U.S., it's all U.N.-run.
[00:13:58.992 --> 00:13:59.773]  They admit the U.N.
[00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:01.234]  gives the orders.
[00:14:01.234 --> 00:14:05.997]  The United Nations said that you go ahead and give it to old people first.
[00:14:05.997 --> 00:14:06.998]  So I'm here in
[00:14:08.402 --> 00:14:11.464]  Utah, I was in Salt Lake at the My Patriot Supply Facility yesterday.
[00:14:11.464 --> 00:14:12.985]  It's incredible what you see the footage.
[00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.847]  Biggest warehouse I've ever been in.
[00:14:14.847 --> 00:14:15.347]  400,000 square feet.
[00:14:15.347 --> 00:14:17.949]  I thought you'd put a Star Destroyer in there.
[00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:19.870]  And I saw billboards all over town.
[00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.212]  If you're above 70, you get it first.
[00:14:23.212 --> 00:14:24.714]  Oh, you're the most at-risk group.
[00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:28.636]  You're above 70, you get the vaccine first.
[00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:34.741]  When the National Health Service in England and the National Institutes of Health here in the United States
[00:14:35.697 --> 00:14:38.838]  Both have fine prints saying if you're above 75, don't take it.
[00:14:38.838 --> 00:14:40.919]  But the billboards, you see how that works?
[00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:43.880]  The fine print says don't take it, but big blue and white billboards.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.380]  Big flashing billboards.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.241]  You need it if you're above 70.
[00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:48.041]  You need it.
[00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:48.862]  You need it.
[00:14:48.862 --> 00:14:50.902]  And I see the same damn billboards in Austin.
[00:14:50.902 --> 00:14:52.403]  I see the same damn billboards everywhere.
[00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:54.343]  You can be in Australia and see the same damn billboards.
[00:14:54.343 --> 00:14:58.385]  Because it's called gluh gluh gluh gluh gluh global government.
[00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:07.913]  global government so the fine print they tell you don't take it but oh and the news are like pregnant women need to take it so you don't get sick.
[00:15:07.913 --> 00:15:10.936]  Oh please if you're pregnant and what does it do?
[00:15:10.936 --> 00:15:11.877]  It attacks the baby.
[00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.739]  Owen Schroer is riding shotgun with me.
[00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:18.764]  He's got a lot to say about this and more when we come back but I have the founder
[00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:20.181]  of course.
[00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:48.700]  He'll be joining after they have physically attacked his wife who were in the hospital at her house and sent a SWAT team to his house.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.621]  But you know, it's no big deal.
[00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:51.161]  It's all part of living in a free society.
[00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:53.983]  But he'll be on the broadcast with us tomorrow.
[00:15:53.983 --> 00:15:54.823]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:57.325]  I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com.
[00:15:57.325 --> 00:15:58.505]  I've got some bad news.

[00:17:59.887 --> 00:18:13.383]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:16.386]  Here's an important quote.
[00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:16.927]  Welcome back.
[00:18:16.927 --> 00:18:20.250]  I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from Utah in the beautiful mountains.
[00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:22.356]  The good Lord created.
[00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:23.717]  Owen Schroeder is back in the ATX.
[00:18:23.717 --> 00:18:27.058]  Let me read to you this quote from Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:18:27.058 --> 00:18:30.960]  in a 1963 letter from Birmingham Jail, that freedom is never given voluntarily.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.081]  It's basically a re-quote of Frederick Douglass.
[00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:35.542]  Freedom is never given voluntarily by the oppressor.
[00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:37.923]  It must be demanded by the oppressed.
[00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:40.985]  You must demand it, for it will not be given freely.
[00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:45.267]  MLK also believed that liberty most often comes to those who petition for it peacefully.
[00:18:46.187 --> 00:18:50.628]  There's a lion-meets-the-lamb dichotomy to the struggle.
[00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:53.629]  Peacefully achieved freedom is not safe from threat.
[00:18:53.629 --> 00:18:58.471]  It must and fiercely be defended as if it were ardently attained.
[00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:06.213]  But because of peace upon that which the freedom is built, its integrity is unassailable.
[00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.394]  So its integrity is unassailable.
[00:19:08.394 --> 00:19:12.615]  And that's why the globalists don't want a velvet revolution.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.223]  Where we just say no to them and freedom is so much obviously better and that America is so much more better than globalism that we just reject it.
[00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:27.346]  They want to accelerate us into a physical conflict because they believe they can kill our free society and cement their takeover that way.
[00:19:27.346 --> 00:19:37.270]  That's why they're going to lead paramilitary groups that are either knowingly controlled or unknowingly controlled because of their low IQs into hitting targets that are not good targets.
[00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.270]  I mean, let me tell you, I'm not saying kill anybody, okay?
[00:19:41.564 --> 00:19:45.688]  You know, the globalists coming at us with these deadly vaccines that they know are meant to depopulate us.
[00:19:45.688 --> 00:19:50.513]  These super unpopular top globalists, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:54.978]  Notice you never see anybody actually going after the people above Biden, above Trump.
[00:19:54.978 --> 00:20:01.485]  You know, there's all this secret service from the President to make you think they actually run things.
[00:20:01.485 --> 00:20:02.626]  That's why they hated Trump.
[00:20:02.626 --> 00:20:03.187]  With Trump,
[00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:07.634]  The first time since Ronald Reagan, we had a guy that was actually president.
[00:20:07.634 --> 00:20:10.296]  By the way, I've interviewed people that worked with Reagan very closely.
[00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:11.196]  It's in the memoirs.
[00:20:11.196 --> 00:20:12.357]  Nancy Reagan talked about it.
[00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:15.820]  Reagan was the president for about a year until they shot him.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.284]  Then they gave him cold blood, caused brain damage, they drugged him up a bunch.
[00:20:20.284 --> 00:20:22.446]  He really never bounced back from that.
[00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:24.207]  Okay?
[00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:27.269]  Ronald Reagan sounded like Alex Jones before Alex Jones was around.
[00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:29.832]  He talked about the New World Order, the Trilateral Commission, the Globalist.
[00:20:29.832 --> 00:20:31.293]  He learned a lot from Barry Goldwater.
[00:20:32.506 --> 00:20:37.616]  He was not going along with the stuff that George Herbert Walker Bush wanted, so they had him shot.
[00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:41.723]  And they had dinner with Hinckley's brother two nights before in Denver, Colorado.
[00:20:41.723 --> 00:20:42.565]  That's in the Denver Post.
[00:20:43.484 --> 00:20:45.785]  And so it's, and his dad was CIA.
[00:20:45.785 --> 00:20:51.989]  And so they literally, you know, took one for the team and had their, probably MKUltra's son.
[00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:54.711]  That's a big thing the CIA did to most of their kids.
[00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:55.992]  And so that's what they did.
[00:20:55.992 --> 00:20:57.593]  And they sent that person in.
[00:20:57.593 --> 00:20:59.754]  So that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:59.754 --> 00:21:02.816]  So we haven't had somebody that was president since about 1981.
[00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:06.698]  It's been a globalist operation.
[00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:09.420]  And Trump got in because it was such a landslide.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.601]  He had another big landslide.
[00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:16.173]  And they are trying to repudiate that landslide, and he is now our real president in exile.
[00:21:16.173 --> 00:21:18.474]  And I'm glad he set up this office of the former president.
[00:21:18.474 --> 00:21:20.855]  I mean, they all do that, but he's officially doing it.
[00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:26.877]  And so all of you again, and most of you aren't doing this, but all of you that are getting off on screw him, he could have done this better, he could have done that better.
[00:21:26.877 --> 00:21:29.278]  I'm going to explain something.
[00:21:29.278 --> 00:21:33.419]  If we let them hang Trump out to dry, do you think we're going to get other presidents that are willing to do this?
[00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:35.219]  Other congressmen that are willing to do this?
[00:21:35.219 --> 00:21:35.920]  Other senators?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.460]  Other governors?
[00:21:37.651 --> 00:21:48.649]  If you turn and run, and don't support Trump now because he wasn't perfect, it sends a message to the next Bolsonaro, or the next whoever it is, that if you do this you get destroyed.
[00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:49.811]  That's the message to me.
[00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:51.814]  Jones, you either join us or you're destroyed.
[00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.652]  Well, I can't sign on to this satanism.
[00:21:54.652 --> 00:21:59.275]  If the globalists weren't corrupt and bad, and they were better than our system, I would adopt it and, you know, I would adopt it.
[00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:00.496]  I wouldn't sell out to it.
[00:22:00.496 --> 00:22:02.538]  I am not adopting their evil system.
[00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:03.578]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[00:22:03.578 --> 00:22:07.161]  People are like, why are you still supporting that piece of trash Trump?
[00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:08.462]  If they're able to destroy Trump,
[00:22:09.062 --> 00:22:12.643]  They're going to destroy everybody else, just like I told you three years ago when they banned me everywhere.
[00:22:12.643 --> 00:22:16.045]  I said, if Trump doesn't do this, by the election they're going to steal it.
[00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:19.766]  They're going to have an internet kill switch for all conservatives that's selective through their AI.
[00:22:19.766 --> 00:22:21.047]  Exactly that's been done.
[00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:25.028]  Go back to the last Joe Rogan interview, four days before the election.
[00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.409]  Four days before the election.
[00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:27.389]  He said, what's going to happen?
[00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.990]  I said, Trump's going to win in a landslide and then they're going to steal it.
[00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:36.925]  And then Trump's going to contest it, and it's going to go to the Supreme Court, and I believe the Supreme Court will betray him.
[00:22:36.925 --> 00:22:38.506]  And they did.
[00:22:38.506 --> 00:22:40.048]  And they did.
[00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:41.469]  And they did.
[00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:55.078]  And then I saw the Supreme Court reshuffle justices over the appeals courts to accelerate the cases on like November 8th or whatever, and I thought, oh wow, oh maybe this means they're going to accelerate it because they know it's fraud.
[00:22:55.078 --> 00:22:58.241]  No, they accelerated it so they could kill all hope and shoot it down.
[00:23:00.458 --> 00:23:02.992]  So you're not the only ones that have false hopes sometimes.
[00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:05.259]  It gets dashed.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.043]  Well, we've got the Democrats making moves just like we thought they would, Alex.
[00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:41.605]  They're talking about packing the Supreme Court.
[00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:44.347]  They're talking about adding D.C.
[00:23:44.347 --> 00:23:45.067]  as a state.
[00:23:45.067 --> 00:23:49.911]  You remember Obama said 57 states, which I guess was a misspeak at the time.
[00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:52.514]  Maybe he was just... Well, Puerto Rico, Guam, yeah, they want 57.
[00:23:53.194 --> 00:23:55.277]  Yeah, he was obviously just letting the cat out of the bag.
[00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:56.017]  So that's all coming on.
[00:23:56.017 --> 00:24:01.764]  They want to declare a climate emergency, but all kinds of different news, the triple mask, quadruple mask, put one on your ass.
[00:24:01.764 --> 00:24:03.446]  I mean, you know, it's all ridiculous.
[00:24:03.446 --> 00:24:10.855]  But you know, the one thing Alex, you mentioned about the office of the former president, it is ceremoniously done in the past, but I think that
[00:24:11.621 --> 00:24:17.970]  The reason why this is so significant is because this is going to be the first one that actually has any impact.
[00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.994]  Nobody really cares about what Obama has to say anymore.
[00:24:20.994 --> 00:24:21.975]  People can pretend they do.
[00:24:21.975 --> 00:24:22.636]  They really don't.
[00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:23.697]  His wife has a podcast.
[00:24:23.697 --> 00:24:24.258]  Nobody listens.
[00:24:24.258 --> 00:24:25.760]  Obama goes on TV and nobody cares.
[00:24:26.581 --> 00:24:28.282]  Well, and Alex, I mean it's the old psychological
[00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:55.900]  We're good to go.
[00:25:18.158 --> 00:25:19.620]  As a president would have.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.422]  And in practice, Alex, it may even be the same.
[00:25:22.422 --> 00:25:27.367]  Because, remember, he was trying to make things happen from the White House, and nobody would obey.
[00:25:27.367 --> 00:25:28.528]  Nobody would do what he said.
[00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:33.853]  So, he's basically going to have the same power of the bully pulpit out of Mar-a-Lago that he had in the White House.
[00:25:33.853 --> 00:25:34.394]  Exactly.
[00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:35.855]  And Trump needs to realize that.
[00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:40.679]  And we need to get that message to Trump, and we are getting that message to him, that he needs to go on the offense.
[00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:42.981]  He needs to demand to face his accusers.
[00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:45.043]  He needs to demand to be in that Senate trial.
[00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.665]  He needs to make it three weeks long, a month long.
[00:25:47.665 --> 00:25:49.867]  Suck all the oxygen out of Biden.
[00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:55.031]  And I hate to even say all this on air, but this is the advice I've actually gotten from the President, and I'll leave it at that.
[00:25:55.031 --> 00:25:56.552]  He needs to just demand.
[00:25:56.552 --> 00:25:59.474]  Because, I mean, in a real trial, he could have a two-month trial.
[00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:05.639]  And Trump just needs to dominate, suck all the air out of Biden, and he can literally turn this whole thing around against him if he doesn't.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.861]  Well, and I'm just wondering again what they're going to do.
[00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:12.003]  I mean, Biden couldn't even... Biden vs. the pen yesterday.
[00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:14.004]  I don't know if you saw that.
[00:26:14.004 --> 00:26:14.965]  So Biden is slipping fast, Alex.
[00:26:14.965 --> 00:26:15.285]  Slipping fast.
[00:26:37.156 --> 00:26:37.976]  Absolutely.
[00:26:37.976 --> 00:26:39.677]  Let's go to break and come back and show.
[00:26:39.677 --> 00:26:42.158]  Let's do Biden in the pen last segment of this hour.
[00:26:42.158 --> 00:26:46.320]  Plus, I know something special is coming up with you, Owen, last segment of this hour.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.982]  You're going to put it to the test with an oxygen reader and show people what it's like to wear three masks.
[00:26:51.982 --> 00:26:55.043]  I mean, my God, this is literally killing people now.
[00:26:55.663 --> 00:26:59.765]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[00:26:59.765 --> 00:27:02.106]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:09.750]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.652]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[00:27:13.652 --> 00:27:17.113]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:19.555]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:21.936]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[00:27:21.936 --> 00:27:23.757]  COVID more devastating than you could ever imagine.
[00:27:24.497 --> 00:27:30.760]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.701]  Okay?
[00:27:31.701 --> 00:27:36.283]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[00:27:36.283 --> 00:27:38.565]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:39.385]  These are real numbers.
[00:27:39.385 --> 00:27:40.666]  These are real facts.
[00:27:40.666 --> 00:27:45.949]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential.
[00:27:45.949 --> 00:27:48.050]  All the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.331]  Rebuke it.
[00:27:49.331 --> 00:27:50.513]  Stand up against it.
[00:27:50.513 --> 00:27:52.275]  This is slavery.
[00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:54.498]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[00:27:58.513 --> 00:28:00.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[00:28:00.294 --> 00:28:02.155]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:04.077]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[00:28:04.077 --> 00:28:09.981]  And now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:12.202]  That's how they changed the subject from election fraud.
[00:28:12.202 --> 00:28:14.604]  It's how they changed the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[00:28:14.604 --> 00:28:20.948]  It's how they changed the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[00:28:20.948 --> 00:28:25.171]  And now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:28.273]  And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political.
[00:28:29.173 --> 00:28:30.514]  And become permanent.
[00:28:30.514 --> 00:28:37.979]  They train you to stay in your houses, they train you to be tracked, they train you to do what you're told for 9-10 months as training wheels, and now they launch the storm.
[00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:39.800]  The storm is here.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.901]  It's a globalist storm.
[00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:43.983]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[00:28:43.983 --> 00:28:46.184]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[00:28:46.184 --> 00:28:47.545]  They're trying to set you up.
[00:28:47.545 --> 00:28:49.406]  Don't be involved in violence.
[00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:53.089]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:54.469]  That's how we beat these people.
[00:28:54.469 --> 00:28:55.030]  With truth.
[00:28:56.551 --> 00:29:04.739]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:29:06.024 --> 00:29:10.766]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:29:10.766 --> 00:29:13.127]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:29:13.127 --> 00:29:21.971]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:29:21.971 --> 00:29:32.835]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:33.795]  Yes.
[00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:38.718]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:29:38.718 --> 00:29:45.642]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:29:45.642 --> 00:29:46.683]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:29:46.683 --> 00:29:48.544]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:29:48.544 --> 00:29:51.366]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:29:51.366 --> 00:29:58.650]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.312]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.302]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:21.302 --> 00:30:22.343]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:30:22.343 --> 00:30:30.608]  All right, we've got some really big Proud Boy news that's going to be breaking next segment, but I'll get to it then.
[00:30:30.608 --> 00:30:35.691]  I want to cover this very important topic right now.
[00:30:35.691 --> 00:30:37.432]  The left is not creative.
[00:30:37.432 --> 00:30:39.033]  The left-hand path is destructive.
[00:30:39.878 --> 00:30:55.203]  And if you go back to ancient secret societies over 4,000 years ago, when we first read about the left-hand path in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the left-hand path is seen as the sinister or the destructive or the not trustworthy and also the hidden.
[00:30:55.203 --> 00:30:59.584]  Because you expect the knife to come from the right hand, not from the left hand.
[00:30:59.584 --> 00:31:01.785]  So the left hand is associated with bad luck.
[00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:03.625]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:04.726]  And then you have the Jacobins.
[00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:10.766]  Who obviously then took over France and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:12.608]  They weren't going after the elite, actually.
[00:31:12.608 --> 00:31:21.578]  They were going after the middle class, the farmers, and some of the smaller landowners because they actually wanted to set up a society where there were no more families based on Satanism.
[00:31:21.578 --> 00:31:25.383]  Now you'll notice the Young Turks have changed their name to the Jacobins.
[00:31:27.224 --> 00:31:27.905]  I don't know.
[00:31:40.939 --> 00:31:44.020]  Remember, nobody told you about Jacobins but me.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.640]  And Lord Monckton, because he's a historian.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.380]  I'm not bragging.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.041]  I'm saying, if you don't know who you're up against, you don't have any hope.
[00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:54.342]  This is a 4,000-year-old Egyptian death cult secret society.
[00:31:54.342 --> 00:31:55.802]  Okay, that's where all this crap comes from.
[00:31:55.802 --> 00:31:58.762]  That's where all the rappers show you all the Egyptian stuff.
[00:31:58.762 --> 00:32:00.883]  They're not actually in the secret society.
[00:32:00.883 --> 00:32:03.743]  They just know that's where the power's at.
[00:32:03.743 --> 00:32:05.964]  But you get to the highest levels of the globalists, look at
[00:32:06.903 --> 00:32:11.025]  Epstein's Island, all that Egyptian temple stuff and Egyptian gods.
[00:32:11.025 --> 00:32:13.686]  That's what this is, okay?
[00:32:13.686 --> 00:32:14.727]  Now, why do I mention that?
[00:32:14.727 --> 00:32:15.787]  Joy Reid came out.
[00:32:15.787 --> 00:32:18.148]  We're going to play this very special report.
[00:32:18.148 --> 00:32:21.670]  We'll put it up on screen for TV viewers so they can see the title.
[00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.452]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[00:32:25.452 --> 00:32:29.194]  She and other Democrats in this tape say, in this compilation,
[00:32:30.473 --> 00:32:39.156]  In the John Bowne section of Bandot Video, that we are jealous of their culture, of their beauty, of how incredible they are, and that we're jealous of minorities.
[00:32:39.156 --> 00:32:44.297]  So white people aren't just racist and evil, they're jealous of black people.
[00:32:44.297 --> 00:32:50.459]  I mean, this is just the most racist, bizarre, crazy stuff, but the left is actually jealous of Americana culture.
[00:32:50.459 --> 00:32:53.480]  The left is jealous of not controlling Christian culture.
[00:32:54.602 --> 00:32:57.906]  The left wants to control the sex of your children.
[00:32:57.906 --> 00:33:04.473]  They want a relationship to talk about how your child should think sexually before you ever even talk to them when they're age five.
[00:33:04.473 --> 00:33:16.105]  These are sick, evil control freaks that represent the satanic order that wants to play God and wants to take over the very genetic code, again back to Egypt, of the twin serpents, the double helix.
[00:33:16.946 --> 00:33:22.989]  So they were given very advanced knowledge by the bad guy, the fallen one, and that's what they believe they're carrying out.
[00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:29.652]  You can see they've built this to a certain point now to basically finish their mission of depopulation.
[00:33:29.652 --> 00:33:30.893]  So, no joy.
[00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:34.532]  We are not enamored with you.
[00:33:34.532 --> 00:33:36.974]  That's why Hollywood's ratings are down about half.
[00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:39.536]  Once you took the NFL over, ratings are down by about half.
[00:33:39.536 --> 00:33:41.518]  Everything you touch, people run from.
[00:33:41.518 --> 00:33:46.082]  The NBA, all of the blue cities and blue states, everyone's racing out of them.
[00:33:46.082 --> 00:33:49.366]  The blue states and blue cities under the UN are doing the global lockdown.
[00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:50.326]  You are the plague.
[00:33:50.326 --> 00:33:51.327]  You are the curse.
[00:33:51.327 --> 00:33:52.809]  We are not envying you.
[00:33:52.809 --> 00:33:53.830]  Here is the John Bowne Report.
[00:33:54.554 --> 00:34:03.011]  Pigs in a Blanket's a crime like bacon lie about Black Lives Matter has been galling me since the people on the right started throwing it out there.
[00:34:03.011 --> 00:34:06.337]  Why is the president calling Black Lives Matter a symbol of hate?
[00:34:06.946 --> 00:34:20.958]  Well, what the president was noting is that that symbol, when you look at some of the things that have been chanted by Black Lives Matter, like pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon, that's not an acceptable phrase to paint on our streets.
[00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:30.466]  There is absolutely zero, none, zero evidence that Black Lives Matter has ever pushed for anything violent, pushed for anything violent to happen to police.
[00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:37.114]  What some may find offensive is also free speech.
[00:34:37.114 --> 00:34:43.781]  What's ironic here is that marchers were being protected by the very officers targeted in the chant.
[00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:46.004]  Statements and chants like that are just ignorant.
[00:34:46.004 --> 00:34:47.886]  You know, I find it absolutely disgusting.
[00:34:54.818 --> 00:35:09.840]  As arrogant and jaded as the left's premier conspiracy theorist is, Joy Reid has haphazardly brought up a major issue that has been pushed into the background due to the paralysis of the state of American culture.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.162]  Jack and company have now permanently suspended Trump's Twitter account.
[00:35:15.162 --> 00:35:16.622]  Finally accomplishing something.
[00:35:16.622 --> 00:35:24.625]  Three wives, multiple legal people who are suing him, and his entire White House staff have failed to do.
[00:35:24.625 --> 00:35:26.966]  Shutting him the hell up.
[00:35:27.446 --> 00:35:35.976]  Proving that we no longer live in a free country where any topic is fair game for criticism protected by our First Amendment.
[00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:45.567]  But even more dangerous is that Reid's arrogant claims are marinated in the progressive opinion that American culture is split in half.
[00:35:46.147 --> 00:35:51.110]  President Biden seems to understand that right-wing radicalization is a real problem.
[00:35:51.110 --> 00:36:00.857]  His team seems to recognize how Fox and Facebook and QAnon fantasies and all of that has caused separate realities in the United States.
[00:36:00.857 --> 00:36:07.421]  He said in his inaugural address that he understands many of his fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation.
[00:36:07.421 --> 00:36:11.884]  And again, that's partly because of all the nonsense that's heard every night in prime time over there.
[00:36:11.884 --> 00:36:13.365]  Unity is impossible, okay?
[00:36:14.085 --> 00:36:20.573]  The United States is living in this parallel, there's parallel universes within the United States.
[00:36:20.573 --> 00:36:21.974]  Unity is not feasible.
[00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:23.095]  It's just not.
[00:36:23.095 --> 00:36:34.769]  This growing schism celebrated by the pundits of neoliberal social influence is a cancerous phenomenon that intends to accelerate the balkanization of America.
[00:36:35.199 --> 00:36:41.827]  Well, 75% of Republicans agree with you because they were fed a big lie by President Trump and his supporters who say the election was stolen.
[00:36:41.827 --> 00:36:44.109]  Why can't you say President Biden won a legitimate fair election?
[00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:45.831]  Well, I think where you make a mistake is that
[00:36:50.256 --> 00:36:57.019]  People coming from the liberal side like you, you immediately say everything's a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything.
[00:36:57.019 --> 00:37:02.301]  Historically, what would happen is if I said that I thought there was fraud, you would interview someone else who said there wasn't.
[00:37:02.301 --> 00:37:07.284]  But now you insert yourself in the middle and say the absolute fact is that everything I'm saying is a lie.
[00:37:07.284 --> 00:37:11.365]  Well, Senator, I said what the President said was a lie because he said, hold on a second.
[00:37:11.365 --> 00:37:13.026]  He said the election was stolen.
[00:37:13.026 --> 00:37:15.027]  This election was not stolen.
[00:37:15.027 --> 00:37:19.249]  The results were certified in every single state after counts and recounts.
[00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:23.511]  You're saying there was no fraud and it's all been investigated.
[00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:24.372]  That's just not true.
[00:37:24.372 --> 00:37:26.033]  That's not what I said, sir.
[00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:28.294]  I said the Department of Justice found no evidence.
[00:37:28.294 --> 00:37:29.335]  Let me finish my point.
[00:37:29.335 --> 00:37:30.976]  You said something that was not true.
[00:37:30.976 --> 00:37:32.496]  You say we're all liars.
[00:37:32.496 --> 00:37:34.618]  You're just simply saying we're all liars.
[00:37:34.618 --> 00:37:37.219]  I said it was a lie that the election was stolen.
[00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:38.260]  You're right and we're wrong.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.521]  Well, let's talk about the specifics of it.
[00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:47.343]  In Wisconsin, tens of thousands of absentee votes had only the name on them and no address.
[00:37:47.343 --> 00:37:48.803]  Historically, those were thrown out.
[00:37:48.803 --> 00:37:50.023]  This time, they weren't.
[00:37:50.023 --> 00:37:55.225]  They made special accommodations because they said, oh, it's a pandemic and people forgot what their address was.
[00:37:55.225 --> 00:37:57.566]  So they changed the law after the fact.
[00:37:57.566 --> 00:37:58.386]  That is wrong.
[00:37:58.386 --> 00:37:59.786]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:37:59.786 --> 00:38:04.628]  And I plan on spending the next two years going around state to state and fixing these problems.
[00:38:04.628 --> 00:38:07.849]  And I won't be cowed by liberals in the media who say,
[00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:11.191]  There's no evidence here and you're a liar if you talk about election fraud.
[00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:12.672]  No, let's have an open debate.
[00:38:12.672 --> 00:38:14.233]  It's a free country.
[00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:27.523]  Adding to Reid's absurdity is her assumption that the supposed and imagined boogeyman she describes as the right is jealous of the far more talented and accomplished left.
[00:38:27.523 --> 00:38:33.828]  The thing the right hates the most about Democrats is that Democrats have the culture.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.541]  Democrats have the culture.
[00:38:36.541 --> 00:38:38.201]  They have the Hollywood culture.
[00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:40.122]  They have the glamorous culture.
[00:38:40.122 --> 00:38:42.102]  And the right hates that.
[00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:44.403]  They feel that the culture is too woke.
[00:38:44.403 --> 00:38:46.264]  It's too multicultural.
[00:38:46.264 --> 00:38:48.284]  It's not John Wayne anymore.
[00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:52.546]  There's all of this multiculturalism and wokeness and liberalism and they hate it!
[00:38:53.286 --> 00:38:55.187]  But they also envy it.
[00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:57.269]  They also wish they had it.
[00:38:57.269 --> 00:39:02.392]  And they hate the fact that after Ronald Reagan, they no longer have a claim to the culture.
[00:39:02.392 --> 00:39:04.513]  They want the culture more than they want the politics.
[00:39:04.513 --> 00:39:06.154]  So they censor us and then say we want them.
[00:39:06.154 --> 00:39:19.203]  ...largely become a voice for the left's globalist totalitarian narrative of humanity's demise via predictive programming, a once shining inventive industry of American exceptionalism,
[00:39:19.403 --> 00:39:31.429]  ...has become a tortured, addled shell of its former self, inhabited by self-serving plastic egomaniacs with a fraction of the talent... Alright, folks, this is one of John Bowne's longer reports.
[00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:33.150]  The full report is at Bandot Video.
[00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.491]  It really needs to get out.
[00:39:34.491 --> 00:39:36.592]  Nobody is jealous of the left's culture of death.
[00:39:36.592 --> 00:39:37.853]  The last few minutes are really powerful.
[00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:39.013]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:44.016]  Alright, coming up... Well, it's being reported Proud Boys' leader was prolific and former for law enforcement.
[00:39:44.016 --> 00:39:46.637]  I'm telling you, almost all these groups are led by feds.
[00:39:46.637 --> 00:39:47.238]  We'll be right back.
[00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:47.618]  Stay with us.
[00:39:56.152 --> 00:39:58.633]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[00:39:58.633 --> 00:40:01.735]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:07.077]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarstore.com.
[00:40:07.077 --> 00:40:09.598]  The subsection is preparewithalex.com.
[00:40:09.598 --> 00:40:11.179]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:13.040]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.802]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[00:40:16.802 --> 00:40:21.926]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're gonna find.
[00:40:21.926 --> 00:40:32.073]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[00:40:32.633 --> 00:40:35.955]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:37.996]  You can find the preparedness section there.
[00:40:37.996 --> 00:40:40.137]  Water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:43.259]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:44.519]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:45.860]  It starts with self-defense.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.141]  It starts with being prepared.
[00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:48.141]  It starts with storable food.
[00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:49.382]  It starts with digging in.
[00:40:49.382 --> 00:40:51.583]  With a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[00:40:54.628 --> 00:41:08.613]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone, and finally a chip under your skin.
[00:41:08.613 --> 00:41:15.436]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group, and Klaus Schwab
[00:41:16.016 --> 00:41:23.321]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, agenda 21, agenda 2030, it's here.
[00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:28.725]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[00:41:30.518 --> 00:41:36.840]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.021]  We must start valuing human life again.
[00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:45.924]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[00:41:45.924 --> 00:41:48.665]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[00:41:48.665 --> 00:41:52.066]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[00:41:55.615 --> 00:41:58.237]  Three, two, one, here we go!
[00:41:58.237 --> 00:41:58.957]  It's back in stock.
[00:41:58.957 --> 00:42:00.438]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[00:42:00.438 --> 00:42:03.519]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[00:42:03.519 --> 00:42:04.840]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.923]  For the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[00:42:08.923 --> 00:42:14.926]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[00:42:14.926 --> 00:42:16.087]  It's amazing.
[00:42:16.087 --> 00:42:17.567]  Folks absolutely love it.
[00:42:17.567 --> 00:42:19.909]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:22.270]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.311]  25% off at m4workstore.com.
[00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:29.053]  Pollen Block, again, is available in this one-minute ad.
[00:42:29.053 --> 00:42:38.758]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable.
[00:42:39.298 --> 00:42:39.639]  I don't know.
[00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:58.490]  The post-industrial world.
[00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:07.752]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:12.254]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[00:43:12.254 --> 00:43:19.196]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[00:43:20.976 --> 00:43:23.979]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[00:43:23.979 --> 00:43:27.123]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[00:43:27.123 --> 00:43:29.085]  It is making the population poor.
[00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:34.992]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[00:43:34.992 --> 00:43:38.315]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding, and they're dystopic.
[00:43:39.396 --> 00:43:42.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:44:10.598 --> 00:44:11.259]  Welcome back.
[00:44:11.259 --> 00:44:17.246]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the beautiful mountains of Utah.
[00:44:17.246 --> 00:44:19.249]  And we have Owen Shorter back in the ATX in Austin.
[00:44:19.249 --> 00:44:20.270]  Big announcements.
[00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.091]  Hey, did you hear?
[00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:21.291]  Merc!
[00:44:22.389 --> 00:44:33.355]  Has pulled its two vaccines because of major health problems and bad reactions, both their mRNA vaccine and their regular vaccine that had a bizarre measles delivery system.
[00:44:33.355 --> 00:44:34.175]  Those have been pulled.
[00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:40.519]  They say it doesn't work and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine because they know the house of cards is coming down.
[00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:45.921]  We also have all these deaths of 20 year olds, 50 year olds, 75 year olds, 80 year olds.
[00:44:45.921 --> 00:44:47.582]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:44:47.582 --> 00:44:48.183]  But don't worry.
[00:44:48.863 --> 00:44:53.067]  Fauci told you 2.4 million Americans would be dead within the first three months last year.
[00:44:53.067 --> 00:44:54.668]  I remember he said that in March.
[00:44:54.668 --> 00:44:57.291]  He said within three months there'll be 2.4 million dead.
[00:44:57.291 --> 00:44:59.913]  Other models had 2.5 million, 2.2 million.
[00:44:59.913 --> 00:45:01.835]  All funded by Bill Gates.
[00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:04.037]  The British model, the German model, and the U.S.
[00:45:04.037 --> 00:45:04.337]  model.
[00:45:04.337 --> 00:45:05.639]  All funded by the same guy.
[00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:08.761]  You wonder why Bill Gates declares, you'll never be unlocked down.
[00:45:08.761 --> 00:45:09.582]  You'll never shake hands.
[00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:10.463]  You'll never stop wearing masks.
[00:45:10.463 --> 00:45:11.964]  You're like, why is this guy in charge?
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:25.187]  He heads up the major eugenics board that controls everything, and he's back in the news today saying people are being so mean to him, and he doesn't know why they think there's a plan to put microchips in you to make sure you've been vaccinated.
[00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:37.194]  I mean, we only have MIT and Rice University saying in documentaries from two years ago that Bill Gates is funding nanotech in the vaccines to prove that you've had the vaccine.
[00:45:37.194 --> 00:45:39.556]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:39.556 --> 00:45:43.178]  It's kind of like what Paul Watson pointed out yesterday when he hosted The Fourth Hour and did a splendid job.
[00:45:44.807 --> 00:45:57.084]  You have Klaus Schwab announcing Great Reset, World Government, New World Order, all of this, and saying COVID's not really a threat, but we're using this to cut the carbon footprint and bring in a technocracy to save the Earth.
[00:45:57.084 --> 00:45:59.728]  The New York Times says the Great Reset doesn't exist.
[00:45:59.728 --> 00:46:00.048]  It's like...
[00:46:00.964 --> 00:46:03.486]  It's like telling your four-year-old, and they go, where'd Grandma go?
[00:46:03.486 --> 00:46:05.207]  Oh, she went on to a better place.
[00:46:05.207 --> 00:46:05.948]  Well, what's dead?
[00:46:05.948 --> 00:46:07.609]  Well, don't worry about that right now.
[00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:09.150]  Death doesn't exist.
[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.172]  Like, where'd the goldfish go?
[00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:18.478]  Well, Spot, or Orange, or Fluffy, whatever the fish's name is, Fluffy's gone to heaven.
[00:46:18.478 --> 00:46:21.260]  No, Fluffy got flushed down the toilet.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:26.064]  So, they talk to you like you're idiots, and so we can never have a real debate about what's going on.
[00:46:27.071 --> 00:46:31.197]  So they put flora in the water for decades, knowing it lowered your IQ and lower fertility.
[00:46:31.197 --> 00:46:34.562]  Now Harvard studies admit that, but still they put it in your water.
[00:46:34.562 --> 00:46:40.611]  It's all about waging war on the general population, stunning you, dumbing you down so they can control you and control the future.
[00:46:40.611 --> 00:46:41.973]  It's about selfishness.
[00:46:41.973 --> 00:46:42.834]  It's about playing God.
[00:46:44.718 --> 00:46:48.141]  They have now announced that it's not enough to kill Hank Aaron.
[00:46:48.141 --> 00:46:51.343]  Now they want everyone to wear two masks, Fauci said yesterday.
[00:46:51.343 --> 00:46:55.747]  So to make him look reasonable, CNBC and others said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:55.747 --> 00:46:56.728]  We need three masks.
[00:46:56.728 --> 00:46:58.269]  Some are saying four masks.
[00:46:58.269 --> 00:47:01.672]  Only four masks, they're saying, is 99% effective.
[00:47:01.672 --> 00:47:07.957]  So they're now admitting that even the so-called surgical mask and, you know, all the rest of it, don't protect you.
[00:47:07.957 --> 00:47:11.100]  Of course they don't, because the virus is small and goes right through it.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.601]  What helps you is nutrition.
[00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:13.662]  Turns out Rendezivir,
[00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:16.130]  Is 100% effective.
[00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.392]  That's why the media doesn't want it.
[00:47:18.392 --> 00:47:20.974]  There's so many things that are 100% effective, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:20.974 --> 00:47:24.738]  But if you don't have vitamin D, you'll 100% die within about six months.
[00:47:24.738 --> 00:47:26.039]  But they want you to stay ignorant.
[00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:28.461]  So they've announced the daily COVID briefings are back.
[00:47:28.461 --> 00:47:30.022]  It's not going away.
[00:47:30.022 --> 00:47:32.985]  It's going to get worse because Bill Gates said it would.
[00:47:32.985 --> 00:47:33.325]  And so...
[00:47:34.326 --> 00:47:39.091]  We now take you to Owen Troyer, a dirty human that needs to cover his face in public.
[00:47:39.091 --> 00:47:40.653]  He needs to cover his dirtiness.
[00:47:40.653 --> 00:47:42.034]  He's a bad person.
[00:47:42.034 --> 00:47:47.199]  All the real studies show that when you are around other people with germs, you share the germs, you have a better immunity.
[00:47:47.199 --> 00:47:47.820]  No.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.061]  I want to see him on camera.
[00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:50.943]  Show me the dirty human right now.
[00:47:50.943 --> 00:47:51.524]  Zoom in on him.
[00:47:51.524 --> 00:47:53.486]  Close shot.
[00:47:53.486 --> 00:47:56.329]  I want people to see a dirty, evil human.
[00:47:57.401 --> 00:47:58.442]  Do we not have a close shot?
[00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.223]  I asked for one.
[00:47:59.223 --> 00:48:04.068]  I need a close shot on this filthy, dirty scumbag.
[00:48:04.068 --> 00:48:04.949]  More.
[00:48:04.949 --> 00:48:05.870]  More.
[00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.273]  Look at him, not covering his face, letting disease come out.
[00:48:09.273 --> 00:48:15.319]  Why, if he gets with a woman and gets married, he might create more of these damn things and eat up the resources of our globalist planet.
[00:48:15.319 --> 00:48:15.819]  So, Owen.
[00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:18.736]  Fauci says wear two masks.
[00:48:18.736 --> 00:48:26.865]  I know that one mask lowers oxygen 15 to 20 percent and increases carbon dioxide or carbon, yes, carbon dioxide and monoxide that's already a trace gas.
[00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:31.050]  I want to see you, you filth bag, put on your mask, okay?
[00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.735]  Now, first admit to everybody you apologize for being human and that you admit you're scum and you're going to submit.
[00:48:37.304 --> 00:48:38.285]  Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:48:38.285 --> 00:48:50.132]  I'm a dirty, I'm a dirty human and I can spread asymptomatically diseases that I don't have and I'm sorry for... Oh, and did you hear about the more, oh, oh, there's the Brazilian and the, and the UK strain.
[00:48:50.132 --> 00:48:51.874]  Have you heard, are you scared of that?
[00:48:51.874 --> 00:49:04.742]  Yeah, Fauci said I should be really scared that it's even more deadly, that it might, you might only have a 99.8 survival rate with this strain, so... If you're above 85, yeah, if you're younger, you can't die from it, absolutely.
[00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:05.463]  So, so right now,
[00:49:06.283 --> 00:49:08.445]  Put on the first mask, let's breathe.
[00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.867]  Take a reading of carbon dioxide first.
[00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:15.971]  Take the reading, show people the reading first, while you're openly dirty breathing, dirty human.
[00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:16.651]  Let's get a breathing.
[00:49:16.651 --> 00:49:19.013]  This has been live in studio all day.
[00:49:19.013 --> 00:49:20.834]  Alright, it hasn't gone off.
[00:49:20.834 --> 00:49:25.038]  It's been going on somewhere between 580 and 620 here.
[00:49:25.038 --> 00:49:27.320]  Parts per million there with the carbon dioxide.
[00:49:29.875 --> 00:49:31.917]  You know what, I'm going to have to increase those levels.
[00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:34.519]  I've been told it's good for me by the global government.
[00:49:34.519 --> 00:49:39.243]  That's right, so you put on your mask, and then we'll take a reading.
[00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:40.043]  You want me to?
[00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:42.705]  How many should I wear, boss?
[00:49:42.705 --> 00:49:53.534]  Well, just breathe for a while, and then, yeah, let's put on, uh... Let's, uh... Let's stick that sensor underneath that ugly face covering.
[00:49:53.534 --> 00:49:54.335]  With just the one?
[00:49:54.335 --> 00:49:56.016]  Your little burka.
[00:49:56.016 --> 00:49:58.098]  Didn't know you'd suddenly be under Islam, did you?
[00:49:58.806 --> 00:50:00.367]  All right, I've got one mask on.
[00:50:00.367 --> 00:50:04.611]  You dirty, filthy American, cover that dirty piehole face of yours.
[00:50:04.611 --> 00:50:11.357]  All right, I've got one mask on right now, Alex, and I'm trying to get it airtight so I don't get any of the COVIDs.
[00:50:11.357 --> 00:50:14.559]  And don't worry, don't worry about this meter if it starts to go.
[00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.901]  Oh, oh, there it goes.
[00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:19.203]  Oh, carbon dioxide's going way up.
[00:50:19.203 --> 00:50:20.584]  Danger, danger.
[00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:21.745]  Well, that's all right.
[00:50:21.745 --> 00:50:24.768]  At least I'm stopping COVID though, Alex.
[00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:29.172]  Hey, but not to mention, Owen, it gets better.
[00:50:29.172 --> 00:50:33.818]  Not to mention, you also, it causes massive bacterial pneumonia.
[00:50:33.818 --> 00:50:36.040]  And they admit that's causing more death, but that's okay.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.482]  Go ahead and put your sensor back down.
[00:50:37.482 --> 00:50:38.963]  Okay.
[00:50:38.963 --> 00:50:39.984]  So it's already dropped a bunch.
[00:50:39.984 --> 00:50:42.267]  Now, let's, now, now, now, now, one is not enough.
[00:50:42.267 --> 00:50:43.848]  We need inspections of this.
[00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:44.629]  Oh, oh, by the way, the, the...
[00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.071]  The China is the model.
[00:50:47.071 --> 00:50:47.671]  They're the heroes.
[00:50:47.671 --> 00:50:54.395]  They've announced now checkpoints with anal probes where they're now going to do anal probes in vans to test to see if you have COVID.
[00:50:54.395 --> 00:50:56.317]  They say that the PCR test isn't valid.
[00:50:56.317 --> 00:50:56.657]  Oh, really?
[00:50:56.657 --> 00:50:57.597]  We already knew that.
[00:50:57.597 --> 00:51:03.221]  So, Owen, so we're going to have mask checkpoints are now announcing in the UK and anal probes.
[00:51:03.221 --> 00:51:04.382]  We've got to do what Gigi Ping does.
[00:51:04.382 --> 00:51:05.643]  We've got to humiliate you better.
[00:51:05.643 --> 00:51:06.583]  That's two masks now.
[00:51:06.583 --> 00:51:07.264]  Is that two masks?
[00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.264]  Yeah, I've got two masks on.
[00:51:08.264 --> 00:51:08.945]  Do you want me to get it?
[00:51:08.945 --> 00:51:11.186]  I can go more, Alex.
[00:51:11.186 --> 00:51:14.328]  Yeah, I guess it's picking up so much carbon dioxide right now, it's going up for us even by your face.
[00:51:14.328 --> 00:51:15.389]  Yeah, go ahead and put it back under there.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.080]  How much has it dropped?
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.781]  Okay, oh!
[00:51:18.781 --> 00:51:20.062]  An InfoWars mask.
[00:51:20.062 --> 00:51:20.562]  Here, let's go.
[00:51:20.562 --> 00:51:23.184]  If you gotta wear one, might as well fight back.
[00:51:23.184 --> 00:51:26.826]  I can reset it if you want, or we can put it back under.
[00:51:26.826 --> 00:51:28.727]  Well, how much did it drop?
[00:51:28.727 --> 00:51:29.687]  It's still dropping now.
[00:51:29.687 --> 00:51:32.909]  It got up to almost 5,000 parts per million.
[00:51:32.909 --> 00:51:35.390]  It's slowly dropping right now.
[00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.411]  Well, let's just stick it back up under there.
[00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:38.672]  That's three masks.
[00:51:38.672 --> 00:51:42.034]  Owen is now doing what CNBC says you should do.
[00:51:42.034 --> 00:51:42.874]  Three masks.
[00:51:42.874 --> 00:51:44.515]  Back underneath the ugly pile.
[00:51:45.689 --> 00:51:47.710]  Stick it under there, the covering where the dirty hole is.
[00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:48.531]  Alright, alright, man.
[00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:52.433]  Cover up that, it's like a big gaping... Well, you know what they call those.
[00:51:52.433 --> 00:51:54.475]  I can't even... Cover up that filthy rat hole.
[00:51:54.475 --> 00:51:55.175]  Alright, here we go.
[00:51:55.175 --> 00:51:56.416]  You filthy, dirty American.
[00:51:57.052 --> 00:51:57.813]  All right.
[00:51:57.813 --> 00:51:58.533]  Okay, good.
[00:51:58.533 --> 00:52:01.915]  Now let's hear about all that brain-damaging carbon dioxide you're breathing.
[00:52:01.915 --> 00:52:02.956]  Oh, you filthy pig.
[00:52:02.956 --> 00:52:04.637]  All right, here we go.
[00:52:04.637 --> 00:52:05.758]  You dirty carbon unit.
[00:52:05.758 --> 00:52:08.140]  We've got to cut all carbon, including all humans, Bill Gates said.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.120]  Yeah, but I'm stopping at least.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.583]  Oh, look at that carbon dioxide surging, oxygen plummeting.
[00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:15.745]  Yes, we have brain damage!
[00:52:15.745 --> 00:52:16.345]  Victory!
[00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:19.448]  God, there's nothing they won't submit to!
[00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:20.688]  I'll bear it as ours!
[00:52:20.688 --> 00:52:21.269]  God!
[00:52:21.269 --> 00:52:21.969]  G.G.P.
[00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:22.750]  is in control!
[00:52:25.236 --> 00:52:27.558]  That's a dangerous level of carbon dioxide I see there.
[00:52:27.558 --> 00:52:29.900]  Owen, give us the reading.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.882]  Yeah, it's actually about to go off the charts it looks like here, Alex.
[00:52:32.882 --> 00:52:39.887]  This thing doesn't go higher than 9,999 parts per million, so I think we're about to go off the meter here, Alex.
[00:52:39.887 --> 00:52:40.488]  Yep, there it goes.
[00:52:40.488 --> 00:52:41.208]  So we're about to go.
[00:52:41.208 --> 00:52:41.869]  How you feeling?
[00:52:41.869 --> 00:52:43.410]  Do you feel like you're being suffocated?
[00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:49.034]  Yeah, I can honestly... Can we show the Godfather 2, uh, Godfather 2 smothering scene?
[00:52:49.034 --> 00:52:52.657]  Just type in Godfather 2, uh, smothering scene.
[00:52:52.657 --> 00:52:54.979]  Or Godfather 2 assassin scene, where the guy puts a pillow.
[00:52:56.254 --> 00:53:04.521]  Yeah, I mean, this is probably how Steve, or excuse me, how Judge Scalia felt in his last moments, I would imagine.
[00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:07.143]  Or Jeffrey Epstein!
[00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.584]  I really cannot breathe in right now.
[00:53:08.584 --> 00:53:12.006]  I mean, it's like... I don't care, you're a terrorist, you're gonna wear at least three.
[00:53:12.006 --> 00:53:14.288]  Let's go further, put a fourth one on.
[00:53:14.288 --> 00:53:15.910]  Do it, or you're a terrorist.
[00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.672]  Or something, you want to charge people with terrorism but don't wear more.
[00:53:18.672 --> 00:53:19.673]  More.
[00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:19.973]  More.
[00:53:21.263 --> 00:53:22.184]  More.
[00:53:22.184 --> 00:53:24.585]  That'll just pour like glue down your throat, Jim.
[00:53:24.585 --> 00:53:28.307]  Why don't you just kill yourself so you don't spread COVID, you dirty human?
[00:53:28.307 --> 00:53:29.467]  How's that feel?
[00:53:29.467 --> 00:53:33.249]  I think if I wear this long enough, Alex, you'll probably snuff me out.
[00:53:33.249 --> 00:53:34.670]  Okay, well, that doesn't matter, terrorist.
[00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.670]  These are good for you.
[00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:43.274]  Put on a fifth one right now, you damn terrorist.
[00:53:43.274 --> 00:53:45.756]  No, that's Godfather Woman that killed Luca Brasi.
[00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:46.756]  That's good for him, too.
[00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:47.997]  He did that to stop COVID.
[00:53:47.997 --> 00:53:49.297]  No, no, no, show the pillow scene.
[00:53:49.297 --> 00:53:50.178]  It's good for you.
[00:53:54.262 --> 00:53:54.662]  More!
[00:53:54.662 --> 00:53:59.309]  Don't even... Hey, put the censor under there, you dirty American!
[00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.870]  Get it?
[00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:01.833]  Radio listeners, we're at Infowars.com.
[00:54:01.833 --> 00:54:02.033]  More!
[00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:02.274]  More!
[00:54:02.274 --> 00:54:02.394]  More!
[00:54:07.318 --> 00:54:08.098]  More!
[00:54:08.098 --> 00:54:08.959]  More, Alex!
[00:54:08.959 --> 00:54:10.159]  More, you're dirty!
[00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:11.559]  I'm gonna die!
[00:54:11.559 --> 00:54:12.260]  More!
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.140]  You're gonna kill me!
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.201]  No, keep going!
[00:54:15.201 --> 00:54:17.701]  This doesn't hurt you to breathe more carbon dioxide.
[00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:19.362]  Doesn't hurt you to take poison vaccines.
[00:54:19.362 --> 00:54:20.982]  Doesn't hurt you to take fluoride.
[00:54:20.982 --> 00:54:22.363]  None GMO's good for you.
[00:54:22.363 --> 00:54:23.183]  5G's good for you.
[00:54:23.183 --> 00:54:23.643]  More!
[00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:24.464]  I can't breathe!
[00:54:24.464 --> 00:54:27.765]  Listen, you're fired if you don't put 10 more on you, dirty!
[00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:30.085]  Phil, submit now, you're a terrorist!
[00:54:30.085 --> 00:54:31.326]  I can't even breathe!
[00:54:31.326 --> 00:54:32.766]  Yes, more!
[00:54:32.766 --> 00:54:34.207]  Get a noose, hang him, kill him!
[00:54:35.339 --> 00:54:37.560]  I think I'm gonna die like this.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.462]  Now you're covered up like an Islamic woman in Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:40.462 --> 00:54:41.543]  Good!
[00:54:41.543 --> 00:54:44.444]  We'll be right back with our number two of the Boogaloos.
[00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:46.826]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:49.667]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:50.868]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[00:54:50.868 --> 00:54:57.332]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[00:54:58.372 --> 00:55:01.994]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:10.998]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[00:55:10.998 --> 00:55:13.059]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20.
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.422]  Thanks to this info for store products.
[00:55:16.422 --> 00:55:19.506]  And by the way, I bought eight hundred dollars worth the other night.
[00:55:19.506 --> 00:55:21.929]  So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[00:55:21.929 --> 00:55:29.697]  So what my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense?
[00:55:29.697 --> 00:55:32.320]  Now, you got to follow that up with the micros.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.622]  Yes, I learned that.
[00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:36.504]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[00:55:36.504 --> 00:55:37.165]  We didn't know.
[00:55:37.165 --> 00:55:38.325]  We didn't screen your call.
[00:55:38.325 --> 00:55:39.126]  We had no idea.
[00:55:39.126 --> 00:55:42.849]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[00:55:42.849 --> 00:55:43.490]  Living Defense.
[00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.010]  Living Defense.
[00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.611]  Living Defense.
[00:55:45.611 --> 00:55:46.832]  We told you it was coming.
[00:55:46.832 --> 00:55:58.301]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them social distance and report them back to cell towers to track their every movement.
[00:55:58.301 --> 00:55:59.422]  This is for everybody.
[00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:00.223]  The way that gets better.
[00:56:00.963 --> 00:56:11.509]  Now, France has programs in their factories, government-pushed and sponsored, to make everyone wear actual dog collars, even making social distance, and report back to simple computers.
[00:56:11.509 --> 00:56:13.710]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.212]  Human-animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[00:56:16.212 --> 00:56:17.372]  It's all being announced.
[00:56:17.372 --> 00:56:21.855]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[00:56:21.855 --> 00:56:27.338]  And big corporations downplay that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[00:56:27.338 --> 00:56:28.279]  Do you understand?
[00:56:28.279 --> 00:56:29.019]  It is a taker.
[00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:30.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:57:03.868 --> 00:57:05.589]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:07.131]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.131 --> 00:57:12.274]  And if you've just joined us, Owen the Dirty Human Troyer is a bad carbon unit.
[00:57:12.274 --> 00:57:13.295]  All carbon is bad.
[00:57:13.295 --> 00:57:15.057]  Trees, plants, humans.
[00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:16.498]  We've got a tax that we've got to control.
[00:57:16.498 --> 00:57:18.719]  We've got to transcend the humans.
[00:57:18.719 --> 00:57:20.060]  Well, I wonder who runs these globalists.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.461]  I mean, I'm not into UFOs and stuff.
[00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:24.464]  I just can think in a logical, linear way.
[00:57:24.464 --> 00:57:25.845]  They want to get rid of humans.
[00:57:25.845 --> 00:57:27.026]  They say the post-human world's here.
[00:57:28.318 --> 00:57:31.682]  The Bible says it's a fallen creature on the planet doing this to us, but whatever.
[00:57:31.682 --> 00:57:34.145]  Maybe we're pre-programmed to kill ourselves, I don't know.
[00:57:34.145 --> 00:57:36.969]  But, Owen Schroyer, let's go back to you.
[00:57:36.969 --> 00:57:39.652]  When I wear one mask, I have trouble breathing.
[00:57:39.652 --> 00:57:41.794]  When I wear two, I try to, it's suffocating.
[00:57:41.794 --> 00:57:43.336]  What was it like to wear six masks?
[00:57:43.336 --> 00:57:48.102]  You legitimately looked like you were panicking there a little bit, buddy, which I couldn't even do what you just did.
[00:57:51.317 --> 00:57:56.240]  I mean, honestly, I mean, you wear the one mask, you can still kind of get some air flow.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.683]  But once you put on the second and the third, I mean, it's like you're sucking in.
[00:58:00.683 --> 00:58:01.344]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:04.026]  It's like a vacuum that's like clogged or something.
[00:58:04.026 --> 00:58:05.366]  It's like you can't.
[00:58:05.366 --> 00:58:07.448]  I mean, they're really you have to really effort.
[00:58:07.448 --> 00:58:10.770]  It's like I guess it would be like having, you know, asthma.
[00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:13.892]  They say if you want to know what it's like to have asthma, you suck air through a straw.
[00:58:13.892 --> 00:58:15.173]  You know, it's tough to breathe.
[00:58:15.173 --> 00:58:19.456]  So it's kind of like the NXIVM cult and all this makes people wear masks and gags.
[00:58:19.456 --> 00:58:20.877]  They're all into being suffocated.
[00:58:21.618 --> 00:58:23.564]  Like, like, like Carradine and all of them.
[00:58:23.564 --> 00:58:25.149]  Literally, this is a cult ritual, isn't it?
[00:58:25.976 --> 00:58:28.238]  No, I can't understand how people do this.
[00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:31.180]  I mean, I think that, you know, quite frankly, I'm so lucky.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.061]  I mean, we're working with one of the last great American companies here at InfoWars.
[00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:37.624]  We can still live free, have a gun, be mask free.
[00:58:37.624 --> 00:58:40.766]  And I guess, you know, it's like we can't even, I can't even relate.
[00:58:40.766 --> 00:58:43.388]  I mean, people sit there for eight hours.
[00:58:43.388 --> 00:58:46.129]  They'll wear a face mask for eight hours.
[00:58:46.129 --> 00:58:48.071]  And they have to wear the mask.
[00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.053]  They don't let them wear the handkerchief or whatever.
[00:58:51.053 --> 00:58:52.214]  It's the mask.
[00:58:52.214 --> 00:58:53.795]  And also, you know, I'm wondering too.
[00:58:53.795 --> 00:58:55.296]  It's also a cast thing because
[00:58:56.016 --> 00:59:01.601]  I like being doing tours of factories or other people's facilities and like none of the owners or CEOs are wearing them and everybody else is.
[00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:04.484]  It's like a, it's literally a caste thing.
[00:59:04.484 --> 00:59:13.753]  Well it is and that's why you see Biden and his family going to the Lincoln Memorial not wearing masks hours after he signs the executive order saying you must wear, you must wear a mask on federal property.
[00:59:13.753 --> 00:59:15.194]  By the way, did you see the press secretary?
[00:59:15.194 --> 00:59:17.777]  We ought to play that later after the Boogaloo commander comes on.
[00:59:17.777 --> 00:59:19.939]  The Boogaloo Lord, I'm sorry.
[00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:23.663]  What's her name?
[00:59:23.663 --> 00:59:24.103]  Sushi.
[00:59:24.103 --> 00:59:25.105]  That's her last name.
[00:59:25.105 --> 00:59:26.606]  The redhead Sushi.
[00:59:26.606 --> 00:59:28.649]  She says, well, that's not serious.
[00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:30.171]  Let's talk about important things.
[00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:34.396]  So him having an order that you gotta wear a mask illegally, that's important.
[00:59:34.396 --> 00:59:36.038]  But when he doesn't, he's important.
[00:59:36.038 --> 00:59:37.820]  She's telling you, oh, he's important.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.202]  He doesn't wear a damn mask.
[00:59:39.724 --> 00:59:46.747]  And you can even find, I mean, again, the healthcare workers, people at grocery stores, wherever, they're wearing the mask eight straight hours.
[00:59:46.747 --> 00:59:53.269]  They are having, like, breakouts, and like, eczema, and like, disease, and all of this stuff.
[00:59:53.269 --> 00:59:55.470]  This is like a Pac-Man hand going on here.
[00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.570]  That's like the globalists, though.
[00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:59.051]  They're like the Pac-Man, just eating up all of our freedoms.
[00:59:59.051 --> 01:00:01.052]  Just nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[01:00:01.052 --> 01:00:02.592]  Just eating any freedom they can take.
[01:00:02.592 --> 01:00:03.613]  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[01:00:04.554 --> 01:00:06.215]  And so they don't even want you to breathe, Alex.
[01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:07.855]  They're going to say breathing is illegal.
[01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.616]  You used to go on air 20 years ago.
[01:00:09.616 --> 01:00:11.116]  People probably thought you were crazy.
[01:00:11.116 --> 01:00:13.017]  Oh, they're going to say there's more than two genders.
[01:00:13.017 --> 01:00:17.138]  They're going to make man and woman and dad and mom illegal to say.
[01:00:17.138 --> 01:00:19.439]  They're going to stop you from even breathing.
[01:00:19.439 --> 01:00:20.560]  And that's where we've gotten to this point.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.701]  In fact, Alex, if you want to play the clip, I had the crew grab it.
[01:00:23.701 --> 01:00:24.901]  We can play it back to back.
[01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:27.942]  Fauci on 60 Minutes saying, no point wearing a mask.
[01:00:27.942 --> 01:00:28.783]  It doesn't do anything.
[01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:29.723]  Don't wear the mask.
[01:00:29.723 --> 01:00:32.324]  Now he says, oh, wear three masks to stop COVID.
[01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:32.684]  Here it is.
[01:00:33.925 --> 01:00:37.225]  Right now people should not be walking, there's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[01:00:38.447 --> 01:00:48.335]  When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet.
[01:00:48.335 --> 01:00:53.139]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[01:00:53.139 --> 01:00:56.682]  And often, there are unintended consequences.
[01:00:56.682 --> 01:01:00.124]  People keep fiddling with the mask, and they keep touching their face.
[01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:03.407]  And can you get some schmutz sort of staying inside there?
[01:01:03.407 --> 01:01:04.568]  Of course, of course.
[01:01:04.568 --> 01:01:08.071]  But when you think mask, you should think of health care providers needing them.
[01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:14.739]  Oh, now it's common sense.
[01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:17.882]  It's common sense to wear two masks, he says now.
[01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:20.525]  And also, you can pass it by farting.
[01:01:20.525 --> 01:01:21.926]  So does Fauci have a giant butt plug?
[01:01:21.926 --> 01:01:25.470]  It just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.
[01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:29.775]  And that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version.
[01:01:29.775 --> 01:01:33.219]  Yeah, but Alex, he wears the butt plug not for reasons to stop COVID.
[01:01:35.555 --> 01:01:37.295]  Well, Snopes should check that claim.
[01:01:37.295 --> 01:01:42.296]  Infowars claims that Dr. Fauci has a buttplug the size of a fire hydrant to stop COVID.
[01:01:42.296 --> 01:01:47.457]  And if you don't put a giant buttplug in, I'm serious, you are helping spread COVID.
[01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:49.238]  China's coming with anal testing.
[01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:49.878]  Now it's going to be here.
[01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:55.519]  I'm not even joking.
[01:01:55.519 --> 01:02:00.920]  President Trump wanted a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[01:02:02.065 --> 01:02:11.997]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United States that had spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[01:02:11.997 --> 01:02:12.698]  They were desperate.
[01:02:12.698 --> 01:02:14.200]  They admitted their own publications.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.423]  They didn't know what to do.
[01:02:16.423 --> 01:02:19.467]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.921]  And stole it better than Dallas.
[01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:26.742]  And now they're coming after the President, they're coming after you, they're coming after me.
[01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:30.764]  They're shutting everybody off the Internet, they're trying to totally censor us.
[01:02:30.764 --> 01:02:34.865]  And that's why InfoWars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[01:02:34.865 --> 01:02:41.488]  We told you this was coming, we were the first main target, and we're still on air at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and BandonVideo.
[01:02:42.228 --> 01:02:46.216]  Without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[01:02:46.216 --> 01:02:53.590]  So while you still can, go to MFORSTORE.COM and get storable foods and high-quality products, supplements, you name it, at MFORSTORE.COM.
[01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:11.142]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:03:11.142 --> 01:03:15.243]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:03:15.243 --> 01:03:23.165]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[01:03:23.165 --> 01:03:27.526]  I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.
[01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:41.055]  So, we go back to 1775 at Lexington and Concord where the war started.
[01:03:52.554 --> 01:03:55.374]  The British had already been tearing up their printing presses.
[01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:58.955]  They'd been confiscating guns and ammo all over Boston.
[01:03:58.955 --> 01:04:02.396]  And the captain of the local militia said, we don't want a war.
[01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:04.936]  We don't want to fight.
[01:04:04.936 --> 01:04:06.256]  And we should not shoot first.
[01:04:06.256 --> 01:04:09.337]  But if they want a war, they're going to get one.
[01:04:09.337 --> 01:04:10.097]  And you know what happened?
[01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.357]  They ended up shooting him and killing him.
[01:04:11.357 --> 01:04:12.677]  And the war started.
[01:04:12.677 --> 01:04:17.258]  And the British, a large part of their force got killed trying to get back to where they came from.
[01:04:17.258 --> 01:04:18.678]  And the rest is history.
[01:04:18.678 --> 01:04:21.119]  It looked like we lost the first five years of the war.
[01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:25.002]  By perseverance, we ended up winning in the end.
[01:04:25.002 --> 01:04:29.343]  So resistance, when you're in the right, is victory.
[01:04:29.343 --> 01:04:30.283]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.283]  Resistance is victory.
[01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:33.844]  And laying down is slavery.
[01:04:33.844 --> 01:04:38.225]  I think those are easy, galactic, common law things.
[01:04:38.225 --> 01:04:39.945]  And so I believe in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:04:39.945 --> 01:04:51.108]  I believe that when we have a destructive government that has come after our freedoms and our rights and that has proven itself to be an authoritarian force that isn't going away, it's not just our right, it's our duty to throw off such a force.
[01:04:52.654 --> 01:04:54.074]  But I don't want to stupidly do it.
[01:04:54.074 --> 01:04:56.195]  I don't want to be led by the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:04:56.195 --> 01:04:59.015]  I don't want to be led by idiots.
[01:04:59.015 --> 01:05:01.016]  I don't want to go at the wrong targets.
[01:05:01.016 --> 01:05:11.837]  And I want to exhaust every form of unofficial warfare, because war is just politics by other means, as von Bismarck said.
[01:05:11.837 --> 01:05:13.578]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:18.679]  And so I'm not very good at war if I can't win with the pen.
[01:05:18.679 --> 01:05:19.819]  And so I'm really trying to do that.
[01:05:20.748 --> 01:05:27.194]  And I'll assure you, I'm not looking for war, but if war ever came and we ever roll ahead to heaven, I would prosecute as hard as I do this show.
[01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:29.276]  With my full intent.
[01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:32.199]  But we have the truth and justice on our side.
[01:05:32.199 --> 01:05:38.786]  And if Martin Luther King could do what he did, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Jesus Christ, their example, shouldn't we follow that example as long as we can?
[01:05:38.786 --> 01:05:40.567]  Now, Mike Dunn, I appreciate him coming on.
[01:05:40.567 --> 01:05:42.709]  Usually people we disagree with are cowards and don't come on.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:47.883]  So he gets high marks coming on, and Mike Dunn is a well-known Boogaloo boy.
[01:05:47.883 --> 01:05:54.607]  They call him the leader, the founder, constitutional adherent, 20-year-old former Trump supporter, turned libertarian.
[01:05:54.607 --> 01:05:56.668]  I guess he was in the Marines, too, as well.
[01:05:56.668 --> 01:05:58.690]  And so I'm going to try to give him the floor for the rest of this segment.
[01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:00.051]  We've got about seven minutes left.
[01:06:00.051 --> 01:06:01.572]  Then I've got my questions and my comments.
[01:06:01.572 --> 01:06:03.353]  So he wants to set us straight.
[01:06:03.353 --> 01:06:05.574]  We're all about folks that want to set us straight.
[01:06:05.574 --> 01:06:07.095]  And if I'm wrong, I will apologize.
[01:06:07.095 --> 01:06:07.996]  So, Mike, thanks for coming on.
[01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.766]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.707]  First things first, I'm not the leader of the Boogaloo.
[01:06:12.707 --> 01:06:13.628]  I'm not the founder.
[01:06:13.628 --> 01:06:15.209]  It's an autonomous movement.
[01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:20.372]  I'm just someone who's in the movement who helped make it big in the media limelight and public face.
[01:06:20.372 --> 01:06:24.555]  And I happen to control a large portion of the movement.
[01:06:24.555 --> 01:06:25.636]  So I just wanted to get that straight.
[01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:28.558]  The movement was not founded by me and I'm not the leader of it.
[01:06:28.558 --> 01:06:31.100]  Simply a prominent figure in it.
[01:06:32.954 --> 01:06:34.997]  To start with, Alex, you started with a quote.
[01:06:34.997 --> 01:06:37.641]  I want to address that as well from yourself.
[01:06:37.641 --> 01:06:39.363]  Here's some other quotes from you.
[01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.887]  1776 is the answer to 1984.
[01:06:41.887 --> 01:06:47.596]  You also said just 5% of people got motivated in some direction, and it doesn't have to be what I believe in.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:56.527]  But if they got motivated and stopped getting their political ideologies from the media, they would go and figure out what they want.
[01:06:56.527 --> 01:06:57.828]  And we're literally doing that.
[01:06:57.828 --> 01:07:00.010]  We have been motivated.
[01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:04.394]  We figured out what we wanted, which is freedom from tyranny, and we're willing to stand against that.
[01:07:04.394 --> 01:07:05.194]  When you say 1776 is the answer to 1984,
[01:07:07.338 --> 01:07:09.839]  And your involvement in the Capitol incidents.
[01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:19.001]  I know you can put up an article from the Gateway Pundit accusing me of inciting the violence and blah, blah, blah, feeding into the media narrative like you don't want others to do.
[01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.181]  Hold on a second.
[01:07:20.181 --> 01:07:21.502]  I don't mean to interrupt you.
[01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:22.182]  I'm on the road.
[01:07:22.182 --> 01:07:23.362]  I don't see what they're putting up.
[01:07:23.362 --> 01:07:27.123]  Let's not put the articles up right now because I'll get to my questions coming up.
[01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:29.044]  I want him to have the floor uninterrupted.
[01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:29.464]  Please continue.
[01:07:31.383 --> 01:07:37.285]  One of your statements that I personally like and I followed you for several years.
[01:07:37.285 --> 01:07:38.625]  I am with Owen Schroyer.
[01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:45.027]  I showed interest in Owen Schroyer back in, I think, the end of 2019 when he was taken off the Capital Four.
[01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:45.827]  But 1776 is the answer to 1984.
[01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:46.948]  I want to paint you a picture from 1776.
[01:07:51.741 --> 01:07:56.143]  January 18th, Major Habersheen arrests a Royal Governor, James Wright.
[01:07:56.143 --> 01:07:58.384]  March 2nd, Americans begin shelling Boston.
[01:07:58.384 --> 01:08:01.926]  March 4th, we capture Dorchester Heights after a bloody battle.
[01:08:01.926 --> 01:08:04.207]  April 7th, we had a bloody major sea battle.
[01:08:04.207 --> 01:08:06.208]  August 27th, we had the Battle of Long Island.
[01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.128]  September 15th, we had another bloody battle.
[01:08:08.128 --> 01:08:11.570]  September 21st, New York City, a quarter of it was burned.
[01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:13.251]  October 11th, we had another bloody battle.
[01:08:13.251 --> 01:08:14.651]  That's just one of the many instances of 1776.
[01:08:14.651 --> 01:08:15.071]  So when you call for 1776,
[01:08:19.884 --> 01:08:24.267]  I almost feel like you're doing it just for the merch and not for the actual fact.
[01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:33.131]  We understand that our laws, our avenues that we should go through have been clogged up by old men in politics.
[01:08:33.131 --> 01:08:35.713]  Politicians who are there for the money, they've been clogged up.
[01:08:35.713 --> 01:08:38.094]  They've blocked us from actually having access to our rights.
[01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:44.138]  They've infringed upon constitutional rights, whether it be the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:44.138 --> 01:08:46.339]  They've infringed on those rights.
[01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:49.002]  And we've realized that those avenues are no longer open to us.
[01:08:49.002 --> 01:08:53.083]  And so the only answer to that is to try to win the hearts and the minds of the people.
[01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:55.243]  And ultimately there is going to be a revolution.
[01:08:55.243 --> 01:08:56.824]  Even you know this.
[01:08:56.824 --> 01:08:58.524]  And I know this.
[01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:02.625]  As far as the Boogaloo is concerned, we're centrist, most of us.
[01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:05.606]  We're libertarian.
[01:09:05.606 --> 01:09:08.647]  And we believe in freedom and liberty for all.
[01:09:08.647 --> 01:09:09.767]  We don't identify with the right.
[01:09:09.767 --> 01:09:12.528]  We don't identify with the left.
[01:09:12.528 --> 01:09:13.108]  We support
[01:09:14.107 --> 01:09:19.730]  For everybody, whether we agree with what they're saying or not, if they're on public space and it's a peaceful protest, we support that.
[01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:22.391]  We've defended peaceful protests repeatedly.
[01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:26.773]  When we stand up and do what you've asked for, you know, we're 5% of the people.
[01:09:26.773 --> 01:09:29.514]  When we stand up and we're actually doing something, we're believing in it.
[01:09:29.514 --> 01:09:31.135]  As a young man, I served in the Corps.
[01:09:31.135 --> 01:09:31.775]  I got injured.
[01:09:31.775 --> 01:09:33.856]  I ended up with nerve damage around my heart.
[01:09:33.856 --> 01:09:40.719]  But as a young man who's standing up and then to see you come out and say, hey, these guys are CIA ops, unbeknownst to them,
[01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:47.936]  I feel that it was rather ridiculous because a lot of these boys had put their heart, time, and soul into standing for what they believe in.
[01:09:47.936 --> 01:09:49.177]  We've lost lives.
[01:09:49.177 --> 01:09:50.398]  Duncan Lent was killed.
[01:09:50.398 --> 01:09:54.881]  A buddy, a personal friend of mine, was killed in Montgomery County, Maryland, by police.
[01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:55.701]  He was a Boogaloo boy.
[01:09:55.701 --> 01:10:01.105]  They went to serve a no-doc search warrant on him, which is a red flag law, which also was endorsed by President Donald Trump.
[01:10:01.105 --> 01:10:03.527]  They went and served that on him and killed him.
[01:10:03.527 --> 01:10:06.709]  And then those of us who stood up and stand out and say, hey, we're done.
[01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:07.550]  We don't care anymore.
[01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:08.791]  We are the sons of liberty.
[01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:11.795]  We are going to engage in civil disobedience.
[01:10:11.795 --> 01:10:19.737]  We're not with this targeting private businesses, but if it's a government facility and it's against the government that continues to oppress, then we're going to do it.
[01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.897]  We all saw widespread voter fraud.
[01:10:21.897 --> 01:10:24.278]  We all understand what happened in the election.
[01:10:24.278 --> 01:10:25.198]  We're not Trump fans.
[01:10:25.198 --> 01:10:26.178]  We're not Biden fans.
[01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:26.978]  We understand that.
[01:10:26.978 --> 01:10:32.279]  But a lot of you hold on to the hope of voting your way out of voter fraud, which is an impossibility.
[01:10:32.279 --> 01:10:34.540]  We see it as there has to be a revolution.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.540]  There has to be a result.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.282]  And it's going to come to that.
[01:10:37.282 --> 01:10:45.796]  We preach unity, bottom scale unity, against the elitists, the globalists, the people who control our country, the people who control our presidents, which you talked about previously.
[01:10:45.796 --> 01:10:49.081]  We see that as a way to say, hey, we're done with tyranny and we're going to stand against it.
[01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:55.092]  We're part of those 3% that have stood up, or in your case, from your quote, you know, it's just 5% of people.
[01:10:55.092 --> 01:10:55.772]  We're part of that.
[01:10:55.772 --> 01:10:57.293]  We're the ones who have stood up.
[01:10:57.293 --> 01:11:01.554]  And that's pretty much all I have to say concerning, you know, the boogaloo and what we're about.
[01:11:01.554 --> 01:11:09.515]  We're about freedom and liberty for all people, non-discrimination, and the Constitution being applicable to those who disagree with you.
[01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:13.136]  Okay, Mike, very interesting points.
[01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:17.097]  I wanted to give you the floor so I'm not accused of overrunning you or not letting you talk.
[01:11:17.097 --> 01:11:17.697]  I do appreciate that.
[01:11:19.699 --> 01:11:25.702]  You probably noticed it came out that Enrique Tarrio Reuters has the documents that he was actually a federal informant.
[01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:27.003]  Does that come as a surprise to you?
[01:11:27.003 --> 01:11:33.266]  Yes, I uploaded that to my Twitter about 20 minutes ago.
[01:11:33.266 --> 01:11:36.168]  See Mike, that's another question.
[01:11:36.168 --> 01:11:37.529]  Maybe you don't get the big picture.
[01:11:37.529 --> 01:11:41.511]  You seem like a smart guy, but there's a lot of things go into this.
[01:11:41.511 --> 01:11:45.033]  You still have a Twitter, but people like me don't.
[01:11:46.221 --> 01:11:47.643]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:11:47.643 --> 01:11:48.724]  Hardware banned on Facebook.
[01:11:48.724 --> 01:11:51.188]  Search terms associated with me are banned on Facebook.
[01:11:51.188 --> 01:11:52.449]  Instagram has hardware banned me.
[01:11:52.449 --> 01:11:55.373]  Search terms associated with me are limited on Instagram.
[01:11:55.373 --> 01:12:00.539]  Almost every other news media outlet, almost every other social media outlet has banned me.
[01:12:00.539 --> 01:12:01.761]  Twitter has repeatedly banned me.
[01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:04.084]  I'm just happening to bypass the ban.
[01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:05.512]  Quietly and quickly.
[01:12:05.512 --> 01:12:08.396]  They'll ban me eventually again.
[01:12:08.396 --> 01:12:10.078]  It's just a matter of finding ways around it.
[01:12:10.078 --> 01:12:13.703]  So before you go on that, we're banned everywhere.
[01:12:13.703 --> 01:12:14.904]  I'm not calling for your banning.
[01:12:14.904 --> 01:12:20.412]  I think everybody should have a voice, whether it's the Ayatollah Khomeini or you or me or Trump or anybody.
[01:12:20.412 --> 01:12:21.173]  We're going to go to break.
[01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:25.635]  And I want to come back and I want to unpack first what you said, because it's true.
[01:12:25.635 --> 01:12:30.198]  I say the answer to 1984 is 1776, and I mean an ideology, an ideal.
[01:12:30.198 --> 01:12:37.302]  When I say 1776 worldwide, I mean Americana Renaissance ideology over Communist and Globalist ideology.
[01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:39.449]  And I believe you're being attacked.
[01:12:39.449 --> 01:12:42.951]  I believe the Uyghurs or I believe the Buddhists have a right to fight back physically in China.
[01:12:42.951 --> 01:12:45.912]  And we're rapidly approaching that point.
[01:12:45.912 --> 01:12:53.114]  The way things are being done, the strategic plan we had that day to get an investigation of voter fraud, the perfect thing for the globalists.
[01:12:53.114 --> 01:12:57.138]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[01:12:57.138 --> 01:12:57.899]  Me too.
[01:12:57.899 --> 01:13:05.007]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:08.992]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[01:13:09.372 --> 01:13:11.292]  You probably already believe that.
[01:13:11.292 --> 01:13:12.293]  I certainly do.
[01:13:12.293 --> 01:13:13.233]  So here's the thing.
[01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:22.135]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:27.556]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[01:13:27.556 --> 01:13:28.916]  No cures or treatments there.

[01:14:54.468 --> 01:14:55.670]  I've got some bad news.
[01:14:55.670 --> 01:15:03.960]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.421]  But here's the good news.
[01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:13.691]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[01:15:14.392 --> 01:15:20.058]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:20.759]  People love it.
[01:15:20.759 --> 01:15:22.080]  That's selling out.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.423]  Despite that, it's still discounted at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:25.423 --> 01:15:29.487]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[01:15:29.487 --> 01:15:31.750]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.

[01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.352]  It's extremely strong as well.

[01:15:52.445 --> 01:15:53.306]  God bless and good luck.
[01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.992]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[01:15:57.992 --> 01:16:01.076]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[01:16:01.076 --> 01:16:06.703]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:06.703 --> 01:16:08.966]  The subsection is preparewithalex.com.
[01:16:08.966 --> 01:16:10.388]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[01:16:10.388 --> 01:16:12.410]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[01:16:13.211 --> 01:16:16.093]  You need to understand that you need a 25-year food supply.
[01:16:16.093 --> 01:16:21.256]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[01:16:21.256 --> 01:16:31.442]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[01:16:31.522 --> 01:16:33.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:12.664 --> 01:17:16.366]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:16.906]  to 3 p.m.
[01:17:16.906 --> 01:17:18.367]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:31.753]  I'm your host Alex Jones in Utah on a family vacation doing some skiing, doing some hiking, hanging out with the crews that came with me and we've got Owen Schroeder back in the ATX in Austin, Texas.
[01:17:31.753 --> 01:17:32.254]  Mike Dunn
[01:17:33.194 --> 01:17:33.454]  Yes.
[01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:01.383]  And then March for the President, and then encamp around the Capitol peacefully.
[01:18:01.383 --> 01:18:05.164]  And we kind of had a blind spot, because Trump rallies are always so peaceful.
[01:18:05.164 --> 01:18:09.566]  We know very small groups, Antifa and some other folks, helped break through, helped get in.
[01:18:09.566 --> 01:18:11.966]  Then a few hundred people went in.
[01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:14.587]  They stayed within the velvet ropes.
[01:18:14.587 --> 01:18:16.508]  So I don't think this was anywhere near Pearl Harbor.
[01:18:16.508 --> 01:18:21.710]  As Chuckie Schumer said, it's about one one-millionth of Pearl Harbor.
[01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:26.092]  And so I'm just trying to figure out, are these, because you mentioned this,
[01:18:27.362 --> 01:18:34.749]  And you respond to the 1776 thing because I'm somebody that's very clear that I believe in civil disobedience.
[01:18:34.749 --> 01:18:39.994]  I believe in defensive defense and violence.
[01:18:39.994 --> 01:18:40.975]  I really want to fix this peacefully.
[01:18:40.975 --> 01:18:43.357]  In fact, let's just go there first.
[01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:49.763]  You're saying, listening to my work, my energy, you're taking from that the idea of revolution or armed conflict?
[01:18:51.001 --> 01:18:52.763]  I definitely wouldn't say that I took it directly from you.
[01:18:52.763 --> 01:19:05.716]  I'm just saying that the idea that you portray and the message that you carry sometimes tend to look like you're just there to create merch and not actually, you know, stand for an actual revolution.
[01:19:05.716 --> 01:19:13.344]  You talk about, you know, peaceful protesting and I always thought, you know, the Alex Jones I listened to growing up was someone who wanted the government to fear the people.
[01:19:13.784 --> 01:19:33.212]  You know, and so I'm not saying that you incited it or you directed it, but I am saying that if you continue to preach a 1776 revolution or the type of message that you preach, you're going to have to figure out whether you're just going to bend the knee and continue to make your talk show or if you're actually going to stand against the tyranny that is present in the U.S.
[01:19:34.278 --> 01:19:37.220]  Well, Mike, let's be 100% clear.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.822]  You better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product.
[01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:40.742]  That gets the word out.
[01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.143]  That's identification.
[01:19:42.143 --> 01:19:42.944]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.365]  They want to shut us down.
[01:19:44.365 --> 01:19:45.325]  They want to kill our speech.
[01:19:45.325 --> 01:19:48.207]  They don't want us to exercise our speech online.
[01:19:48.207 --> 01:19:52.650]  You guys wear your shirts that are Hawaiian shirts, as you can be known.
[01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:53.851]  We're Infowars.
[01:19:53.851 --> 01:19:56.893]  And damn right, I've got the globalists trying to shut me down.
[01:19:56.893 --> 01:19:57.733]  I am a capitalist.
[01:19:57.733 --> 01:20:03.477]  I didn't get $10.6 billion from Democrat donors and George Soros like Black Lives Matter.
[01:20:03.777 --> 01:20:08.560]  So I don't get any funding like Antifa or BLM.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.061]  I don't have people volunteering to do my security.
[01:20:10.061 --> 01:20:11.301]  I pay my security.
[01:20:11.301 --> 01:20:13.643]  I don't have the Boogaloo Boys volunteering for my security.
[01:20:13.643 --> 01:20:14.923]  I pay for my security.
[01:20:14.923 --> 01:20:16.564]  So, I mean, I'm a capitalist.
[01:20:16.564 --> 01:20:18.485]  I am not ashamed of selling products.
[01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:22.808]  But to be clear, if we get to a point where I think I've got to be violent,
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.941]  Then I'll do what I have to do.
[01:20:24.941 --> 01:20:26.802]  That's why I'm fighting so hard.
[01:20:26.802 --> 01:20:27.563]  That's why I'm fighting so hard.
[01:20:27.563 --> 01:20:30.404]  Because I'm not going to stand around capitals with guns if I get violent.
[01:20:30.404 --> 01:20:31.245]  Okay?
[01:20:31.245 --> 01:20:33.807]  In fact, tell me how this revolution... Tell you what, you've got the floor again.
[01:20:33.807 --> 01:20:35.307]  How does this revolution look?
[01:20:35.307 --> 01:20:36.949]  How do you see this thing unfolding?
[01:20:36.949 --> 01:20:40.591]  Tell me, General George Washington 2.0, how we're going to do this revolution.
[01:20:42.168 --> 01:20:42.488]  I don't know.
[01:20:42.488 --> 01:20:45.490]  I thought you were the General George Washington 2.0.
[01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.390]  No, no, no.
[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:48.712]  I'm not the guy out there saying we're going to have a revolution.
[01:20:48.712 --> 01:20:57.616]  So tell me, we need a Declaration of Independence by the states, we need a coalition of leaders ready with a bill of particulars of what we want, and then we go to war.
[01:20:57.616 --> 01:20:59.457]  Not a bunch of people taking selfies in the Capitol.
[01:20:59.457 --> 01:21:00.658]  That's the opposite of what we need.
[01:21:00.658 --> 01:21:01.578]  We need George Washington.
[01:21:01.578 --> 01:21:02.679]  He hasn't shown up yet.
[01:21:02.679 --> 01:21:06.961]  So I'm telling you, tell me what we do, General Dunn.
[01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:09.543]  What do we do right now?
[01:21:09.543 --> 01:21:09.963]  Go for it.
[01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:12.371]  Get those papers in order.
[01:21:12.371 --> 01:21:14.592]  Get the plan of government for AFTER in order.
[01:21:14.592 --> 01:21:17.314]  And actually get it done and start building forces like you're supposed to.
[01:21:17.314 --> 01:21:18.594]  Like all of us have done.
[01:21:18.594 --> 01:21:19.395]  We've been together.
[01:21:19.395 --> 01:21:20.415]  We've stood together.
[01:21:20.415 --> 01:21:25.338]  We go to our capitals armed where they say, you know, in Richmond, Virginia, Owen Sawyer drove there.
[01:21:25.338 --> 01:21:26.779]  He saw some of my guys there armed.
[01:21:26.779 --> 01:21:28.520]  They said, hey, you can't open carry here anymore.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.680]  It's illegal now.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:29.980]  We went.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:30.981]  We disobeyed it.
[01:21:30.981 --> 01:21:35.043]  If they had tried to arrest us, we would have used the Second Amendment the way that it was intended, which is to limit... Hold on.
[01:21:35.043 --> 01:21:35.563]  Say that again.
[01:21:35.563 --> 01:21:36.384]  Where did you do this?
[01:21:36.384 --> 01:21:38.205]  Because this is you putting your money where your mouth is.
[01:21:38.205 --> 01:21:38.725]  Where did you do this?
[01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:40.779]  This is in Richmond, Virginia.
[01:21:40.779 --> 01:21:43.920]  It's illegal to open carry any protest or weapon at arm.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.782]  So, we go there for Owen Shorter's thing when he came through with the Stop the Steal.
[01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:54.444]  We've been at every protest, whether it be MAGA, Black Lives Matter, anything, to make sure that things are peaceful and respectful.
[01:21:54.444 --> 01:21:55.344]  And we go there armed.
[01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:56.545]  We disobey the law.
[01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:58.265]  We stand against the tyranny.
[01:21:58.265 --> 01:22:05.408]  And what we see, people like you, Alex, who used to be my hero as a young man, we see y'all bending the knee to it repeatedly.
[01:22:06.308 --> 01:22:17.435]  You have your talk shows, you give your speeches, but y'all don't actually stand against tyranny, and that's disheartening as a young man, a young American, and someone involved in the liberty movement and constitutionalism personally, I'm not speaking for both of you.
[01:22:17.435 --> 01:22:23.319]  How am I not standing against tyranny, fighting evil legislation, marching, going out and having events?
[01:22:23.319 --> 01:22:23.559]  Sorry?
[01:22:24.912 --> 01:22:26.473]  Because you talk.
[01:22:26.473 --> 01:22:28.235]  We go out there, we actually disobey.
[01:22:28.235 --> 01:22:29.436]  We stand there armed.
[01:22:29.436 --> 01:22:33.579]  We don't bootlick like a lot of you and Republicans do.
[01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.901]  We actually stand up against the tyranny that is prevalent.
[01:22:36.437 --> 01:22:37.557]  That's what I want to see y'all do.
[01:22:37.557 --> 01:22:39.858]  When you ask, well, what's the revolution look like?
[01:22:39.858 --> 01:22:40.578]  Well, there you go.
[01:22:40.578 --> 01:22:42.479]  It's us engaging in civil disobedience.
[01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:45.800]  And if they decide to do something, then we'll stand against that.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.301]  You're not going out there where they say, hey, you can't open carry here.
[01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:50.842]  You can't exercise a constitutional right.
[01:22:50.842 --> 01:22:52.062]  You're not going out there and disobey it.
[01:22:52.062 --> 01:22:55.303]  Y'all want to do everything by the law because you're the party of law and order.
[01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.604]  Well, no, I have.
[01:22:56.604 --> 01:23:00.265]  I have supported open carry and I've supported the lawsuits and all the rest of it.
[01:23:00.265 --> 01:23:01.985]  So that's that's not a fair statement.
[01:23:01.985 --> 01:23:03.286]  What I'm getting at here is.
[01:23:04.858 --> 01:23:15.531]  The strategic blunder of rushing into the Capitol, the strategic blunder of the selfies and the Q-Tard stuff, and all the rest of it, is not what Trump wanted, it's not what I wanted.
[01:23:15.531 --> 01:23:19.936]  That was our rally to try to put pressure on them to have a 10-day investigation of election fraud.
[01:23:19.936 --> 01:23:23.841]  So wait, do you think what happened at the Capitol was a victory or a fiasco?
[01:23:25.529 --> 01:23:28.472]  I definitely think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[01:23:28.472 --> 01:23:30.373]  I think it was a good way to make government fear the people again.
[01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:34.777]  It was nice to see members of Congress on their knees fearing the people.
[01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:38.941]  I think it was the right thing for the wrong reasons.
[01:23:38.941 --> 01:23:44.806]  So you now wish that people wouldn't have knocked down the doors and gone in there?
[01:23:44.806 --> 01:23:47.909]  I wish 100% that people would do it more all over this country and make government fear the people.
[01:23:49.957 --> 01:23:54.460]  You know, if I may chime in here, because I've been brought up a couple times.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:58.363]  Here's what I think the problem is, and this is what I said after January 6th.
[01:23:58.363 --> 01:24:05.127]  We can discuss the events of January 6th, what happened, or what 1776 to defeat 1984 means.
[01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:09.350]  The problem is, we're not actually having that intellectual debate.
[01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:11.992]  There's no doubt that we have encroaching global government.
[01:24:11.992 --> 01:24:14.353]  There's no doubt that the government's out of control.
[01:24:14.353 --> 01:24:18.576]  There's no doubt that the biggest crooks in America are in Washington, D.C.
[01:24:19.957 --> 01:24:21.458]  Americans would agree to that.
[01:24:21.458 --> 01:24:25.679]  Here's the problem, though, and Mike, I'd like to get your response to this.
[01:24:25.679 --> 01:24:39.865]  We're not in a 1776 colonist versus the British government time where we're hiding in the woods and we've got the local communities and they don't have a world technocracy set up against us or a federal government set up against us.
[01:24:39.865 --> 01:24:42.986]  I mean, I've been to jail multiple times for my free speech.
[01:24:42.986 --> 01:24:44.026]  You know that.
[01:24:44.026 --> 01:24:48.048]  So, I mean, to sit here and say... No, you've done nothing because you didn't stand around in a Hawaiian shirt with a gun.
[01:24:48.328 --> 01:24:58.763]  But my point is, if you really think you're going to launch some sort of a physical kinetic war against the deep state or against D.C., there's just no path to victory there.
[01:24:58.763 --> 01:25:00.605]  I mean, the whole federal government is against you.
[01:25:00.605 --> 01:25:01.627]  Well, there actually is.
[01:25:01.627 --> 01:25:02.248]  Let's go to break.
[01:25:02.248 --> 01:25:04.951]  I'm not calling for this, but the Capitol is a puppet.
[01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:06.423]  I'm
[01:25:26.283 --> 01:25:30.646]  I'm not saying do this, but if you really want a violent revolution, you should be calling for the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:25:30.646 --> 01:25:35.009]  Every member should be in a deck of cards, the whole leadership, Richard and Haas, all the rest of them.
[01:25:35.009 --> 01:25:38.852]  And the last thing I want is anything to happen to Bill Gates, or Richard and Haas, or any of them.
[01:25:38.852 --> 01:25:42.274]  I'm just saying, if you really want to do this, Klaus Schwab should be the ace of spades.
[01:25:42.274 --> 01:25:45.817]  And then Bill Gates is, you know, right after that, okay?
[01:25:45.817 --> 01:25:48.579]  I'm just telling you, man, you're hitting the wrong target.
[01:25:48.579 --> 01:25:50.900]  Like a monkey fucking a football.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.261]  Back, stay with us.
[01:25:52.261 --> 01:25:55.664]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[01:25:56.224 --> 01:25:58.786]  They are forcing mutations.
[01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:02.389]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:11.235]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[01:26:11.235 --> 01:26:11.576]  No.
[01:26:11.576 --> 01:26:14.298]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[01:26:14.298 --> 01:26:21.643]  Now we see some propaganda, like communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen!
[01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:25.046]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops!
[01:26:25.826 --> 01:26:32.052]  Well, the same things would happen to our troops, and thousands and thousands would die each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[01:26:32.052 --> 01:26:36.616]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[01:26:36.616 --> 01:26:40.200]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.180]  But that's not even true.
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:45.765]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, and federal and state law.
[01:26:45.765 --> 01:26:51.130]  This is violence being carried out against us by the military, and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[01:26:53.530 --> 01:27:00.373]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products, M4s, are no longer available.

[01:27:43.457 --> 01:27:45.038]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.

[01:28:55.326 --> 01:29:08.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:08.916 --> 01:29:11.298]  The West is the Best!
[01:29:15.407 --> 01:29:19.929]  The West is the best, and it's gonna do the rest.
[01:29:19.929 --> 01:29:21.730]  They'd love to ban this song.
[01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:24.652]  I know everybody's trying to get into the West.
[01:29:24.652 --> 01:29:28.314]  What is it about the West?
[01:29:28.314 --> 01:29:31.916]  What is it?
[01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:42.722]  Since 2019, at least 31 people affiliated with the Boogaloo movement have been charged with crimes including the killing of two security and law enforcement officers, a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer,
[01:29:44.193 --> 01:29:46.695]  Let me ask Mr. Dunn, the founder of the Boogaloos,
[01:30:09.244 --> 01:30:11.105]  Let me ask him this question.
[01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:19.509]  Are those people that don't speak for Boogaloos, because you're one of the most prominent members of them, you're not the leader, but you're the guy that always gets brought up.
[01:30:19.509 --> 01:30:22.371]  I mean, who are these people getting arrested?
[01:30:22.371 --> 01:30:26.253]  Are they launching the good revolution, or are those not good Boogaloos?
[01:30:28.387 --> 01:30:29.588]  It's like anything.
[01:30:29.588 --> 01:30:33.410]  Some are legitimate Boogaloo boys who we knew, who were in our circles.
[01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:41.173]  And then, once again, anybody can claim, hey, I'm Boogaloo, just like anybody can claim they're associated with you or claim that you incited the insurrection.
[01:30:41.173 --> 01:30:46.596]  I wanted to answer Owen's question or Owen's statement from a minute ago, if I could have permission to do that.
[01:30:47.196 --> 01:30:47.857]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:30:47.857 --> 01:30:51.200]  And Owen, jump in any time you want.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:31:07.956]  You know, my response to it, and what I think he was leaning into and what he had mentioned, you know, legislative bodies going through the courts, the lawful way of protesting, if y'all haven't noticed for about the past 160 years since the last war, we've done that.
[01:31:07.956 --> 01:31:09.397]  Those avenues have been used.
[01:31:10.061 --> 01:31:18.968]  And if you think you can vote your way out of voter fraud, or push your rights through the courts that have already tread on those same rights... Hold on, let me just stop, because let me finish my statement.
[01:31:18.968 --> 01:31:21.289]  Let me just finish my statement to give more clarity.
[01:31:21.289 --> 01:31:29.936]  I'm just saying, if you really think that a violent revolution is the answer, you've got to understand you're going up against a completely different enemy than what we had in 1776.
[01:31:29.936 --> 01:31:33.678]  Way more powerful, way more seditious, way more in the shadows.
[01:31:33.678 --> 01:31:37.061]  The feds come to arrest you in the middle of the night, nobody's going to have your back.
[01:31:37.481 --> 01:31:38.241]  Who's going to have your back?
[01:31:38.241 --> 01:31:39.682]  They'll just disappear you.
[01:31:39.682 --> 01:31:43.343]  And I think the thing we have to do first... Mike, let me finish please, sir.
[01:31:43.343 --> 01:31:47.924]  The thing we have to do first is we have to have common unity.
[01:31:47.924 --> 01:31:53.106]  This can't be Boogaloo vs. Infowars or Mike vs. Alex or Owen vs. this or Black Lives Matter here.
[01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:53.586]  Everyone!
[01:31:53.586 --> 01:31:56.327]  I can disagree with Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Boogaloo, whatever, all day long.
[01:31:56.607 --> 01:31:58.269]  We're all anti-establishment.
[01:31:58.269 --> 01:32:00.390]  We have to come together and have that unity.
[01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:06.356]  That will have our politicians in more fear is us having unity than saying we're coming with guns.
[01:32:06.356 --> 01:32:09.118]  They'll wipe us off the map if we do that.
[01:32:09.118 --> 01:32:10.960]  Do you know the military will have our back?
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.161]  We don't know that.
[01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:13.562]  Unity has to be the first step.
[01:32:15.484 --> 01:32:22.487]  Says that he'll nuke American gun owners, which is totally unfeasible and ridiculous and insane, and he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
[01:32:22.487 --> 01:32:24.308]  Just look, look, look, look, here's the deal.
[01:32:24.308 --> 01:32:26.889]  Mike, I get you on here, you seem like a real guy.
[01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:40.514]  You don't seem like a Southern Poverty Law Center operative, you don't seem like an ADL operative, but certainly, Mike, you know about the Southern Poverty Law Center's history of infiltrating militias, populist right-wing groups, and then provocateuring them.
[01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.615]  I mean, do you know about the long history of false flags?
[01:32:43.956 --> 01:32:45.096]  Yeah, I do.
[01:32:45.096 --> 01:32:50.658]  And I just wanted to respond to Owen real quick and say that's exactly what we have been doing.
[01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:54.719]  Michigan, Ohio, look up Magnus on Twitter, his speech.
[01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:58.561]  We've been uniting people under Black Lives Matter, traditional militias.
[01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:00.921]  We've been uniting them for one common cause.
[01:33:00.921 --> 01:33:03.282]  But yet, you know, we put in that work.
[01:33:03.282 --> 01:33:04.122]  We've done that.
[01:33:04.122 --> 01:33:09.584]  You can go back to one of my first public events, which was July 4th of last year, where we united Black Lives Matter gun owners.
[01:33:10.148 --> 01:33:14.070]  Well, that means you got with Black Lives Matter low levels that weren't Soros' Democratic Party
[01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:29.377]  I agree Alex.
[01:33:29.377 --> 01:33:32.098]  The organization is funded by people who have misused them, but a lot of the movement or
[01:33:56.109 --> 01:34:01.032]  They're actual individuals who believe what they stand for, and we stand by the fact that Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:01.032 --> 01:34:07.356]  I've seen them actually racially discriminated against in my own cities, so I'm willing to stand with them and defend their right to speak.
[01:34:07.356 --> 01:34:09.298]  You see that picture right there you just put up?
[01:34:09.298 --> 01:34:12.760]  The police did not touch that peaceful protest while we were on the front line arm.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.941]  They did not touch them.
[01:34:13.941 --> 01:34:19.084]  Antifa started chanting, F Mike Dunn, F Boogaloos, F Black Lives Matter 757, which is an organization
[01:34:19.664 --> 01:34:25.588]  An organization that has reached out to us and actually formed a cohesive body and we stood together side by side.
[01:34:25.588 --> 01:34:28.569]  They started chatting that we left because we said, hey, we don't want to split the crowd.
[01:34:28.569 --> 01:34:29.610]  Y'all do your thing.
[01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:30.370]  The minute we left.
[01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:34.813]  So you recognize that Antifa is a globalist organization?
[01:34:34.813 --> 01:34:38.695]  I recognize that a lot of Antifa factions are the same as Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:38.695 --> 01:34:39.335]  Here's an example.
[01:34:39.335 --> 01:34:40.296]  Here's photos.
[01:34:40.296 --> 01:34:44.898]  Here's photos that we were sent in Austin by one of our friends of
[01:34:46.994 --> 01:34:50.155]  You know, on the 20th or whatever, there's probably this big overthrow coming.
[01:34:50.535 --> 01:34:56.778]  And I mean, they had Antifa signs, they were Antifa, posing basically as militia or boogaloos.
[01:34:56.778 --> 01:34:58.558]  And I mean, you look at some of the photos of these guys.
[01:34:58.558 --> 01:35:02.780]  They've got the classic meth head, you know, locked up in mommy's basement.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.401]  They're Antifa, not wearing their mask.
[01:35:05.401 --> 01:35:07.122]  And, well, let me just bring this up.
[01:35:07.122 --> 01:35:08.943]  And some of them were saying they were boogaloos.
[01:35:08.943 --> 01:35:10.023]  I mean, look at this guy.
[01:35:10.023 --> 01:35:10.503]  Come on.
[01:35:10.503 --> 01:35:12.484]  What's up with the zip ties?
[01:35:12.484 --> 01:35:15.485]  So all I'm saying is, they're saying armed revolution's coming.
[01:35:15.485 --> 01:35:17.306]  These are the people claiming they're with your movement.
[01:35:18.844 --> 01:35:24.308]  General Patton was in Tifa, and while you're throwing up those pictures, you probably want to throw up the rest of all the armed protests that we put on and done.
[01:35:24.308 --> 01:35:27.590]  So you could obviously pull a select picture and say, hey, these are the people.
[01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:32.654]  But until you actually pull out the pictures... Wait, General Patton actually wanted to join with the Germans and attack the Russians.
[01:35:32.654 --> 01:35:37.077]  So to say that he was Antifa is, he was probably actually one of the only fascist generals we had.
[01:35:37.077 --> 01:35:41.460]  I'm not even against Patton, but you're now saying General George T. Patton was an Antifa?
[01:35:43.393 --> 01:35:47.517]  That led the force to fight and combat fascism is what I'm talking about.
[01:35:47.517 --> 01:35:51.660]  No, he was racing to take over Berlin so he could get the Nazis behind him to beat the Russians.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:52.561]  Antifa.
[01:35:52.561 --> 01:35:53.762]  Our country is Antifa.
[01:35:53.762 --> 01:35:55.343]  That's why they killed him, buddy.
[01:35:55.343 --> 01:35:58.866]  I interviewed the son of the guy that killed him.
[01:35:58.866 --> 01:36:00.407]  But we are Antifa.
[01:36:00.407 --> 01:36:01.148]  You can't argue that.
[01:36:01.148 --> 01:36:03.150]  Are you anti-fascist or do you support fascism?
[01:36:05.112 --> 01:36:07.753]  You're taking these arguments at face value, Mike.
[01:36:07.753 --> 01:36:10.775]  If you try to ask an Antifa member, they don't really understand what's going on.
[01:36:10.775 --> 01:36:12.276]  Again, notice where they go.
[01:36:12.276 --> 01:36:13.356]  They don't go to Google.
[01:36:13.356 --> 01:36:14.637]  They don't go to government buildings.
[01:36:14.637 --> 01:36:15.758]  They don't go to capitals.
[01:36:15.758 --> 01:36:17.358]  They go to Home Depot.
[01:36:17.358 --> 01:36:19.460]  They go to, you know, 7-Eleven.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.720]  They burn down a Kwik Trip.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.861]  I mean, it's total chaos.
[01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:22.621]  You can't have that.
[01:36:22.621 --> 01:36:24.282]  They burn down somebody's private car dealership.
[01:36:24.282 --> 01:36:25.503]  So let's expand on this.
[01:36:25.503 --> 01:36:27.684]  You raised this, Don, and I'm not here trying to attack you.
[01:36:27.684 --> 01:36:29.084]  I mean, you come off as a real person.
[01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:29.625]  I'll just say that.
[01:36:30.265 --> 01:36:33.126]  Exclusive, Boogaloo Boy, you raised this so we looked it up.
[01:36:33.126 --> 01:36:38.248]  Boogaloo Boy Leader, who aligns with Black Lives Matter, because we didn't put this up, you're like, you can put that up on screen.
[01:36:38.248 --> 01:36:40.988]  I'm like, I didn't know, we didn't put this on screen.
[01:36:40.988 --> 01:36:42.509]  You raised it, we got it up.
[01:36:42.509 --> 01:36:49.151]  Exclusive, Boogaloo Boy Leader, who aligns with Black Lives Matter, Gateway Pundit, boasted about organizing armed insurrection on U.S.
[01:36:49.151 --> 01:36:50.111]  Capitol.
[01:36:50.111 --> 01:36:51.812]  Are these your archive tweets or not about
[01:36:52.712 --> 01:36:55.994]  Uh, BB teams have been activated in Virginia.
[01:36:55.994 --> 01:37:01.377]  We are currently four fire teams, those assault squads, inside the capitol.
[01:37:01.377 --> 01:37:03.358]  Simper, you know, death to tyrants.
[01:37:03.358 --> 01:37:07.780]  And it's all right here about we rub it in your face, you have no security, we're in charge.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.981]  Did you or did you not tweet that?
[01:37:10.569 --> 01:37:11.589]  One thousand percent.
[01:37:11.589 --> 01:37:14.550]  And note that the capital is not the same as the capital, which means the building.
[01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:16.411]  It means the city of D.C.
[01:37:16.411 --> 01:37:16.891]  So note that.
[01:37:16.891 --> 01:37:25.574]  And furthermore, note that that media can twist anything they said out of perspective and take away from tweets it was originally connected with.
[01:37:25.574 --> 01:37:26.095]  They can do that.
[01:37:26.095 --> 01:37:26.855]  They do it easily.
[01:37:26.855 --> 01:37:29.956]  So don't fall into the same thing that you preach against, which is listening to media.
[01:37:31.001 --> 01:37:33.222]  Yeah, but don't you understand that's the problem, though?
[01:37:33.222 --> 01:37:34.383]  I trust them.
[01:37:34.383 --> 01:37:36.504]  I found them to be very accurate, but okay, fine.
[01:37:36.504 --> 01:37:38.105]  I won't just out of hand trust them.
[01:37:38.105 --> 01:37:39.566]  We're going to go on a break in a moment.
[01:37:39.566 --> 01:37:53.694]  I'm going to give you the floor to respond to this when we come back, but I was honest with everybody around my office, and I'm not an informant like Enrique Tarrio, but at the same time, I want to expose the federal forces that are involved in this.
[01:37:53.694 --> 01:37:58.997]  We identified Boogaloos and we identified Proud Boys leading the attack on the Capitol with Antifa.
[01:37:59.599 --> 01:38:01.019]  And I'm now bringing all this out today.
[01:38:01.019 --> 01:38:03.760]  I was already intending to before this broke about Tarrio.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.701]  So.
[01:38:04.701 --> 01:38:07.321]  And we have the footage.
[01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:10.202]  So no Boogaloo has won the Capitol.
[01:38:10.202 --> 01:38:13.003]  Put it up of a Boogaloo boy walking into the Capitol.
[01:38:13.003 --> 01:38:14.924]  And I will... Oh, and they have their faces covered.
[01:38:14.924 --> 01:38:17.664]  But, I mean, well, we got you saying you have fireteams inside the Capitol.
[01:38:17.664 --> 01:38:21.085]  But I'm going to ask you right now.
[01:38:21.085 --> 01:38:22.426]  You said we're inside the Capitol.
[01:38:22.426 --> 01:38:24.647]  You said that doesn't mean what you said.
[01:38:24.647 --> 01:38:24.927]  D.C.
[01:38:24.927 --> 01:38:26.927]  is the Capitol, not the Capitol Building.
[01:38:26.927 --> 01:38:27.447]  Oh, D.C.
[01:38:27.447 --> 01:38:28.548]  is the Capitol.
[01:38:28.548 --> 01:38:29.148]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:29.924 --> 01:38:30.404]  Yes.
[01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:31.465]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:38:31.465 --> 01:38:38.329]  We're going to find out who these guys wearing camo that had masks on, and we think they work for the FBI, okay?
[01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:43.672]  Because our president that really got elected is on trial in a week and a half, and we're pissed off about it, okay?
[01:38:43.672 --> 01:38:48.555]  And we wanted to put peaceful pressure on them to show our numbers, and we got screwed over by some people.
[01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:49.856]  We're going to find out who they are.
[01:38:49.856 --> 01:38:51.617]  And if you can show us it's not the boogaloo, that's great.
[01:38:51.617 --> 01:38:56.320]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.641]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:38:59.039 --> 01:39:00.719]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:39:00.719 --> 01:39:02.400]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.340]  That was a crazy week.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:15.024]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:39:15.024 --> 01:39:16.344]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[01:39:17.833 --> 01:39:20.214]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:39:20.214 --> 01:39:21.615]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:39:21.615 --> 01:39:25.877]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:39:25.877 --> 01:39:28.098]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:39:28.098 --> 01:39:29.599]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:39:29.599 --> 01:39:30.400]  It's never happened to me.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.321]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:39:33.321 --> 01:39:35.022]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:39:35.162 --> 01:39:37.925]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:39:37.925 --> 01:39:45.895]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[01:39:45.895 --> 01:39:49.219]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:39:49.219 --> 01:39:50.741]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:59.754]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[01:39:59.754 --> 01:40:07.964]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying,
[01:40:08.664 --> 01:40:11.968]  That they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[01:40:11.968 --> 01:40:14.651]  That they want businessmen technocrats over it.
[01:40:14.651 --> 01:40:15.913]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[01:40:15.913 --> 01:40:21.399]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[01:40:21.399 --> 01:40:24.123]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[01:40:25.043 --> 01:40:30.406]  See, he believes because his head doesn't blame you, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[01:40:30.406 --> 01:40:32.508]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[01:40:32.508 --> 01:40:33.929]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[01:40:33.929 --> 01:40:38.452]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[01:40:38.452 --> 01:40:40.753]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[01:40:40.753 --> 01:40:42.014]  It is what works.
[01:40:42.014 --> 01:40:47.437]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[01:40:47.437 --> 01:40:49.959]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[01:40:53.445 --> 01:41:02.237]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[01:41:02.237 --> 01:41:09.026]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it.
[01:41:09.406 --> 01:41:10.627]  This does not have a fluoride.
[01:41:10.627 --> 01:41:12.028]  It doesn't have any additives.
[01:41:12.028 --> 01:41:13.269]  This is a concentrate.
[01:41:13.269 --> 01:41:14.710]  It really is high quality.
[01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:19.874]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:21.656]  But now it's back in stock.
[01:41:21.656 --> 01:41:26.099]  Info Wars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.
[01:41:26.099 --> 01:41:31.583]  Now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:38.309]  It also makes a great gift for your family, for your grandkids, for your mother, your father, for everybody.
[01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:40.070]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.510]  I just love it.
[01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:41.451]  I can't get enough of it.
[01:42:01.135 --> 01:42:03.377]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[01:42:03.377 --> 01:42:04.618]  That's what fills my mug.
[01:42:04.618 --> 01:42:05.779]  That's what fills my belly.
[01:42:05.779 --> 01:42:07.261]  That's what fills my soul.
[01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:09.203]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[01:42:09.203 --> 01:42:13.327]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:13.947]  Years.
[01:42:13.947 --> 01:42:15.649]  Never raised the price.
[01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.949]  Never.
[01:42:15.949 --> 01:42:18.471]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[01:42:18.471 --> 01:42:19.653]  The crew here loves it.
[01:42:19.653 --> 01:42:20.874]  We drink it every day.
[01:42:20.874 --> 01:42:25.318]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[01:42:25.478 --> 01:42:27.859]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[01:42:27.859 --> 01:42:33.442]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[01:42:33.442 --> 01:42:35.002]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[01:42:35.002 --> 01:42:36.263]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[01:42:36.263 --> 01:42:37.324]  4.9 star.
[01:42:37.324 --> 01:42:43.026]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[01:42:43.026 --> 01:42:47.008]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a 5 star, except maybe one or two people.
[01:42:47.008 --> 01:42:52.611]  Patriot Blend, 100% organic coffee, only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:55.164 --> 01:42:57.755]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:11.767 --> 01:43:12.487]  And we are back.
[01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:23.254]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm about to do something with my hundred-plus crew, all the Democrat lawsuits, and our satellites, and our own infrastructure, our own servers, parlors shut down, Telegram shut, you know, they're shutting everything down.
[01:43:23.254 --> 01:43:24.815]  We're only on air because of you.
[01:43:24.815 --> 01:43:27.817]  And, you know, we've had big sales for months.
[01:43:27.817 --> 01:43:29.738]  We've sold out of so many products.
[01:43:29.738 --> 01:43:31.719]  We have liquid turmeric extract.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:33.801]  Discounted.
[01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.602]  We're down to a thousand bottles.
[01:43:35.602 --> 01:43:37.304]  It has 100% reviews.
[01:43:37.304 --> 01:43:38.966]  It's an amazing high quality product.
[01:43:38.966 --> 01:43:40.727]  It's different than bodies.
[01:43:40.727 --> 01:43:42.109]  That is an ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:43.710]  This is a humanoid extract.
[01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:45.892]  This is a natural concentrate extract.
[01:43:45.892 --> 01:43:47.214]  They go together like a horse and carriage.
[01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:53.258]  It is discounted right now, but it is selling out today.
[01:43:53.258 --> 01:43:56.639]  Also, X2 is a Deep Earth Crystal Pure Iodine.
[01:43:56.639 --> 01:44:00.900]  We have to get a DEA license at our manufacturer in Arizona.
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.301]  It's literally locked up, because you know, it's a precursor.
[01:44:03.301 --> 01:44:07.843]  Everybody's seen Breaking Bad, but it's so good for your body.
[01:44:07.843 --> 01:44:09.283]  It's a precursor to everything.
[01:44:09.283 --> 01:44:10.344]  We have the Deep Earth Crystal.
[01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:15.826]  It is 50% off, but that sale has to end in a couple of days, because we're down to like 2,000 bottles
[01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:21.598]  We're not getting more for six weeks because of supply chain breakdown.
[01:44:21.598 --> 01:44:27.542]  So get your Survival Shield X2 50% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:27.542 --> 01:44:47.337]  And yes, it's on pre-order, but it's being printed in Texas, outside Austin, in Georgetown, by the great veterans that run the company, the Joe Biden, Trader Joe's shirt, like, you know, the Trader Joe's grocery store, but it shows all the countries he sold out to, Iran, China, Russia, you name it.
[01:44:48.274 --> 01:44:49.094]  It's a great shirt.
[01:44:49.094 --> 01:44:50.175]  I thought it'd be a bestseller.
[01:44:50.175 --> 01:44:51.796]  It is a bestseller.
[01:44:51.796 --> 01:44:53.637]  And the problem is we only printed a couple thousand.
[01:44:53.637 --> 01:44:55.137]  They sold out instantly.
[01:44:55.137 --> 01:44:56.538]  Well, we got more coming in next week.
[01:44:56.538 --> 01:44:58.979]  So get your orders in right now for Trader Joe's t-shirts.
[01:44:58.979 --> 01:45:03.061]  MFORESTORE.COM takes a lot of money to keep this show on air.
[01:45:03.061 --> 01:45:04.562]  Everybody else is being shut down.
[01:45:04.562 --> 01:45:05.943]  All the ecosystems are being shut down.
[01:45:07.332 --> 01:45:11.314]  So we want to thank you again for your financial support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:45:23.501 --> 01:45:25.142]  But whatever you do, check it out today.
[01:45:25.142 --> 01:45:27.163]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:27.163 --> 01:45:28.524]  The January 2021 Mega Sale ends.
[01:45:30.885 --> 01:45:31.266]  I don't know.
[01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:46.851]  Those are very popular for the winter.
[01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:50.593]  It's long-sleeve, kind of the football-style jersey or hockey jersey.
[01:45:50.593 --> 01:45:52.374]  It's all at infowarestore.com.
[01:45:52.374 --> 01:45:53.935]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[01:45:53.935 --> 01:45:55.516]  This is a war and we salute you.
[01:45:55.516 --> 01:45:56.837]  All right, back to Mike Dunn.
[01:45:56.837 --> 01:46:00.479]  And we got Roman Schroer riding shotgun in the studio.
[01:46:00.479 --> 01:46:04.201]  And Pete Santilli wants to pop in saying he's been set up like this before.
[01:46:04.201 --> 01:46:06.643]  Looks like COINTELPRO, what they're doing to Enrique Tarrio.
[01:46:06.643 --> 01:46:07.123]  I like it.
[01:46:07.123 --> 01:46:07.843]  He's a nice guy.
[01:46:07.843 --> 01:46:09.384]  They're saying he's a federal informant.
[01:46:09.384 --> 01:46:10.265]  We'll talk about all that.
[01:46:10.805 --> 01:46:16.648]  But for new listeners tuning in, we've gone under world government, we're fighting back, we're trying to find out who the provocateur groups are.
[01:46:16.648 --> 01:46:20.170]  And I'll just say it, and I've said this, I'm not against the Proud Boys.
[01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:23.392]  They've been lying about it, I don't think they're racist, all that other stuff.
[01:46:23.392 --> 01:46:29.136]  We know there were Proud Boys not wearing their outfits, not wearing their uniforms, that were part of the Capitol breach.
[01:46:29.136 --> 01:46:34.879]  We have tweets by you and by other people saying they supported the Capitol attack and that it was a great thing.
[01:46:34.879 --> 01:46:36.480]  Now you're kind of halfway back and off of that.
[01:46:37.031 --> 01:46:38.892]  I'm not here trying to get you arrested.
[01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:44.397]  My big question is, I see this Dr. Gold lady just going in being arrested.
[01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:52.023]  I see Brandon Strzok being arrested when he was just there doing nothing.
[01:46:52.023 --> 01:46:53.464]  And then it freaks me out.
[01:46:53.464 --> 01:46:59.228]  Who are the men in uniforms with masks handing out clubs saying, attack, attack, attack?
[01:46:59.228 --> 01:47:02.251]  That's my big question because I've seen the 1990s, 2000s militia movement.
[01:47:04.619 --> 01:47:09.541]  Where I would be in a shooting range, and have feds come over and say, hey, let's blow up a federal building.
[01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:13.803]  And I'd go out and videotape their car, and it was an unmarked federal police, you know, federal car.
[01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:16.184]  I mean, that's a giant template they've used.
[01:47:16.184 --> 01:47:24.947]  So, you can see, Mike Dunn, where I'm a little concerned, and I see this going on, and I'm worried about the idea of your movement, that anybody can say they're a boogaloo.
[01:47:24.947 --> 01:47:26.348]  It's like, are you for anonymous?
[01:47:26.348 --> 01:47:27.528]  Well, anybody can be anonymous.
[01:47:27.528 --> 01:47:28.228]  Are you for Q?
[01:47:28.228 --> 01:47:31.530]  Anybody can be for Q. I mean, don't you worry that...
[01:47:32.731 --> 01:47:35.593]  I'm going to stop ranting here, but explain to me, Boogaloo, where it came from.
[01:47:35.593 --> 01:47:37.494]  Are you worried about being taken over?
[01:47:37.494 --> 01:47:39.376]  I mean, what do you think is really happening here?
[01:47:41.236 --> 01:47:48.920]  Since Boogaloo is an ideology, it's not necessarily a worry of being taken over because if somebody doesn't embody that ideology, then they're not Boogaloo.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.282]  Boogaloo started as a meme, a joke, back in like 2012.
[01:47:52.282 --> 01:47:54.323]  It was just an online joke.
[01:47:54.323 --> 01:48:02.967]  And then in 2019, several people started making it a little more public and actually turning it into an ideology or belief that liberty is for all and we're done being tread on.
[01:48:02.967 --> 01:48:09.590]  We're done going the old ways of crying and begging on our knees for the courts that are already screwed up to help us.
[01:48:10.269 --> 01:48:18.274]  Uh, we're tired of trying to vote our way out of a system that is controlled, um, that is controlled by the globalists that you speak of.
[01:48:18.274 --> 01:48:19.114]  Um, we're tired of it.
[01:48:19.114 --> 01:48:20.595]  And we stood up 20- 2019.
[01:48:20.595 --> 01:48:27.979]  And then in early 2020, Duncan Lipp, uh, who was a Boo Blue boy, was killed in his home as they started a red flag on him saying that he was a risk.
[01:48:27.979 --> 01:48:34.663]  21 years old, a buddy of mine, was murdered in his bed, um, because- because he had firearms.
[01:48:34.663 --> 01:48:37.605]  And that sparked the Boo Blue movement nationwide.
[01:48:37.605 --> 01:48:39.826]  All of us started taking to the streets and saying, you know what?
[01:48:40.134 --> 01:48:42.355]  We're done hiding behind computer screens.
[01:48:42.355 --> 01:48:44.015]  Um, we're done talking.
[01:48:44.015 --> 01:48:45.676]  We're done doing all of this.
[01:48:45.676 --> 01:48:47.176]  We're going to go out there and take a stand.
[01:48:47.176 --> 01:48:53.918]  And if they want, as horrible as war is, if they want a war, let it begin with us because our fathers didn't.
[01:48:53.918 --> 01:48:56.679]  No offense, Alex, but your generation did.
[01:48:56.679 --> 01:48:58.500]  And so our children don't have to.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.741]  We're going to stand up now and say, this is it.
[01:49:00.741 --> 01:49:01.681]  We're done with the journey.
[01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:01.901]  Sure.
[01:49:01.901 --> 01:49:02.001]  Sure.
[01:49:02.001 --> 01:49:04.482]  It's like when Steve McKenna goes, you haven't been in the military, have you?
[01:49:04.482 --> 01:49:05.722]  So trust the plan.
[01:49:05.722 --> 01:49:06.122]  Yeah.
[01:49:06.122 --> 01:49:07.943]  Look, look, here's my issue.
[01:49:10.057 --> 01:49:12.559]  Are you guys putting out a manifesto of targets?
[01:49:12.559 --> 01:49:20.405]  Because, you know, random police, capitals, that's, I mean, that's just a seat of what the people should be in control of.
[01:49:20.405 --> 01:49:23.807]  I mean, I'm not calling for targets, God forbid, I don't want any violence.
[01:49:23.807 --> 01:49:24.748]  What about Bill Gates?
[01:49:24.748 --> 01:49:28.451]  What about Ted Turner?
[01:49:28.451 --> 01:49:29.932]  What about the UN?
[01:49:29.932 --> 01:49:36.077]  So tell me, tell me in a deck of cards, like Saddam Hussein was the top target 2003, like who's the ace of spades for you guys?
[01:49:37.575 --> 01:49:44.578]  It would be ignorant to sit here and release a manifesto or say this is a... Yeah, so let's not mention any real evil kingpins, right?
[01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:46.779]  I'm not going to allow you to goad me into saying something like that.
[01:49:46.779 --> 01:49:48.860]  Say that again?
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:52.701]  I'm not going to allow you to goad me into saying something like that.
[01:49:52.701 --> 01:49:53.722]  That would be ridiculous.
[01:49:53.722 --> 01:49:57.203]  Oh, like the Southern Poverty Law Center does, posing as malicious?
[01:49:57.203 --> 01:49:58.124]  Goading people into stuff?
[01:50:00.635 --> 01:50:02.957]  Oh, maybe I am.
[01:50:02.957 --> 01:50:04.358]  Maybe you're right.
[01:50:04.358 --> 01:50:08.961]  Listen, what I'm telling you is, I want to save this country.
[01:50:08.961 --> 01:50:12.903]  And running around storming capitals is not the way to do it.
[01:50:12.903 --> 01:50:15.305]  Either the courts or not, Alex, the country is not safe.
[01:50:15.305 --> 01:50:16.025]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:50:16.025 --> 01:50:19.728]  Do you have 50 Democratic lawsuits against you?
[01:50:19.728 --> 01:50:21.249]  What say again?
[01:50:21.249 --> 01:50:24.151]  Do you have the Democratic Party financing your destruction like I do?
[01:50:27.084 --> 01:50:27.985]  I don't know, nor do I care.
[01:50:27.985 --> 01:50:29.225]  I'm gonna stand by what I'm doing.
[01:50:29.225 --> 01:50:32.687]  It's the fact that you're doing the same thing that has been done for years and it's not accomplishing anything.
[01:50:55.066 --> 01:50:58.969]  The only thing that's going to accomplish is forcing a revolution.
[01:50:58.969 --> 01:50:59.609]  You're talking.
[01:50:59.609 --> 01:51:00.730]  That's all you're doing.
[01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:03.452]  You're doing the same thing that's been done for years, brother.
[01:51:03.452 --> 01:51:05.393]  I have not told anybody to storm the Capitol.
[01:51:05.393 --> 01:51:08.115]  I've preached revolution and I always will.
[01:51:23.424 --> 01:51:24.885]  Well, let's raise this thing.
[01:51:24.885 --> 01:51:30.208]  The Boogaloo Supreme Leadership, whoever they are, said go to D.C.
[01:51:30.208 --> 01:51:34.090]  the weekend after the 6th and have armed marches, but you guys didn't show up.
[01:51:34.090 --> 01:51:37.131]  So you were trying to get other people to come into D.C.
[01:51:37.131 --> 01:51:39.012]  and so you could sit back and eat popcorn and watch that.
[01:51:39.012 --> 01:51:41.454]  Or was that not the Boogaloos that said that?
[01:51:41.454 --> 01:51:42.694]  It's the word you like, Alex.
[01:51:42.694 --> 01:51:43.635]  It's called a side-off, brother.
[01:51:46.326 --> 01:51:47.206]  Oh, a PSYOP.
[01:51:47.206 --> 01:51:56.651]  So you're not going to respond to the stack of tweets I've got and messages from you saying we're going to have an armed march three days after the 6th.
[01:51:56.651 --> 01:51:58.752]  Alex, you're a liar.
[01:51:58.752 --> 01:52:02.573]  Show the tweet where I said we're going to have an armed march.
[01:52:02.573 --> 01:52:03.894]  Show the tweet.
[01:52:03.894 --> 01:52:05.275]  So the Boogaloos did not call.
[01:52:05.275 --> 01:52:07.776]  They didn't say armed march is still on for DC.
[01:52:07.776 --> 01:52:09.476]  We're going to have it.
[01:52:09.476 --> 01:52:12.378]  Show the tweet where I said there's going to be an armed march.
[01:52:12.378 --> 01:52:13.738]  I'm talking about the Boogaloo Lordship.
[01:52:13.738 --> 01:52:15.019]  Well, you said you're not the Lordship.
[01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:18.902]  I said I'm not the leader.
[01:52:18.902 --> 01:52:20.622]  Oh, so you don't have any problems or anything.
[01:52:20.622 --> 01:52:25.903]  Have you ever been to the ADL or Southern Primary Law Center headquarters?
[01:52:25.903 --> 01:52:26.383]  I don't care.
[01:52:26.383 --> 01:52:29.344]  I don't care to go to any of those places because I care less about them.
[01:52:29.344 --> 01:52:31.405]  I'm here to stand for what I believe in regardless of the hate.
[01:52:31.405 --> 01:52:32.705]  Well, you're saying I'm a liar.
[01:52:32.705 --> 01:52:33.165]  I know.
[01:52:33.165 --> 01:52:34.205]  I've got a stack of articles.
[01:52:34.205 --> 01:52:35.226]  Maybe they're wrong.
[01:52:35.226 --> 01:52:36.846]  And if I'm wrong, I'll say it.
[01:52:36.846 --> 01:52:39.927]  That the Boogaloo... No, no, no.
[01:52:39.927 --> 01:52:40.327]  Pardon me.
[01:52:41.442 --> 01:52:42.443]  You didn't say the boogaloo.
[01:52:42.443 --> 01:52:43.104]  You said you.
[01:52:43.104 --> 01:52:44.105]  Play it back if you want to.
[01:52:44.105 --> 01:52:47.469]  You said you called for an armed march in D.C.
[01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:49.071]  I have tweets where you called for it.
[01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:50.012]  That's why I said you're lying.
[01:52:50.012 --> 01:52:52.735]  So you've never called for armed marches against capitals, period?
[01:52:54.274 --> 01:52:57.657]  I have said that no armed march in D.C., an armed march in D.C.
[01:52:57.657 --> 01:52:58.337]  would be unwise.
[01:52:58.337 --> 01:52:59.918]  I've said that repeatedly.
[01:52:59.918 --> 01:53:00.799]  Well good, good for you.
[01:53:00.799 --> 01:53:02.460]  I remember the boogaloo said that.
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.061]  So wait, I thought you were a man of action though.
[01:53:04.061 --> 01:53:07.304]  You just said that I'm the coward and you're the man of action.
[01:53:07.304 --> 01:53:08.965]  100% wise action.
[01:53:08.965 --> 01:53:09.726]  Wise action.
[01:53:09.726 --> 01:53:13.148]  I go to capitals where we can punk a police department, punk city councils.
[01:53:13.148 --> 01:53:16.390]  But you told me earlier that we should not follow the law.
[01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:21.154]  You said I'm a coward, I follow the law, you don't follow the law because you're for revolution.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:22.900]  Correct.
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:30.088]  I'm for revolution, but I'm for wise revolution, which is where we go to these capitals, we punk the PDs, we punk the city councils that want to make... We punk the PDs.
[01:53:30.088 --> 01:53:30.328]  Unlawful.
[01:53:30.328 --> 01:53:31.069]  Unlawful.
[01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:33.031]  Yeah, because the local cops are our issue.
[01:53:33.031 --> 01:53:33.832]  Alright, alright.
[01:53:33.832 --> 01:53:36.294]  Hey, you are the boogaloo, more chip.
[01:53:36.294 --> 01:53:38.337]  We're going to come right back if you still are here with us.
[01:53:42.543 --> 01:53:45.026]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[01:53:45.026 --> 01:53:48.109]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:53.735]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarsstore.com.
[01:53:53.735 --> 01:53:55.998]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[01:53:55.998 --> 01:53:59.441]  And it's all these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[01:54:00.222 --> 01:54:03.125]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:08.310]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:19.021]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[01:54:19.021 --> 01:54:20.202]  So, preparewithalex.com.
[01:54:20.342 --> 01:54:21.543]  We're good to go.
[01:54:42.697 --> 01:54:44.920]  You must guard your humanity.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.784]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[01:54:47.784 --> 01:54:50.549]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[01:54:50.549 --> 01:54:54.735]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[01:54:54.735 --> 01:54:57.940]  But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:06.465]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops.
[01:55:06.465 --> 01:55:13.450]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[01:55:13.450 --> 01:55:17.694]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[01:55:18.955 --> 01:55:21.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:56:00.862 --> 01:56:09.609]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Dunn, the Supreme Field Marshal, founder and absolute commander of the Boogaloos.
[01:56:09.609 --> 01:56:11.991]  I know he's going to say, I'm not the founder, I'm not the leader.
[01:56:11.991 --> 01:56:13.913]  It's called a joke.
[01:56:13.913 --> 01:56:16.935]  But it's like Q or it's like Anonymous.
[01:56:16.935 --> 01:56:18.897]  You never know who the leader is.
[01:56:18.897 --> 01:56:20.078]  It's an ideology.
[01:56:20.078 --> 01:56:20.919]  It's not our fault.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:24.421]  Have any Boogaloos been arrested, Mike Dunn?
[01:56:24.421 --> 01:56:26.481]  Or do you know of any Boogaloos?
[01:56:26.481 --> 01:56:27.801]  I know now you're calling D.C.
[01:56:27.801 --> 01:56:28.261]  the capital.
[01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:29.222]  We've stormed the capital.
[01:56:29.222 --> 01:56:30.222]  We're in command.
[01:56:30.222 --> 01:56:32.082]  You mean you're in D.C.
[01:56:32.082 --> 01:56:33.282]  with fireteams.
[01:56:33.282 --> 01:56:33.943]  But if D.C.
[01:56:33.943 --> 01:56:39.584]  doesn't allow you to have guns, you just said you won't violate laws, but I'm a wimp, I don't violate laws.
[01:56:39.584 --> 01:56:43.285]  I'm a wimp, I don't violate laws, but you don't want to violate laws.
[01:56:43.285 --> 01:56:45.305]  We want to be smart about violating laws.
[01:56:45.305 --> 01:56:48.246]  And then you were in the capital, but you weren't in the capital with these fireteams.
[01:56:50.086 --> 01:56:51.547]  Explain it to me, because I'm an honest man.
[01:56:51.547 --> 01:56:52.487]  It's hard to count an honest man.
[01:56:52.487 --> 01:56:57.030]  It's literally right there in front of our Capitol, as in D.C.
[01:56:57.030 --> 01:57:00.351]  Nobody said anything about the Capitol building, number one.
[01:57:00.351 --> 01:57:03.153]  Number two, no Boogaloo boy attends a protest unarmed.
[01:57:03.153 --> 01:57:06.654]  So you can answer your, you can fill in your imaginations as well.
[01:57:06.654 --> 01:57:15.719]  What I said was I would not encourage an open arm march on D.C., which is what I've said repeatedly, because I find it a poor tactical plan, a poor strategy.
[01:57:16.378 --> 01:57:24.200]  Um, so I know you like blowing things out of proportion and trying to paint me as the bad guy or paint me as illogical, but I've, I've been consistent with what I'm saying.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.741]  You just, you keep trying to twist it out, man.
[01:57:25.741 --> 01:57:37.664]  No, Mike, I'm trying to find out who the guys in camo are that lead the attack with Antifa and then get a few, maybe a hundred idiots to go in with them so that, so that they can destroy a peaceful movement.
[01:57:37.664 --> 01:57:39.665]  I've been around quite a few Antifa.
[01:57:39.665 --> 01:57:42.265]  Um, you know, there are, there are some Antifa that are good.
[01:57:42.265 --> 01:57:44.066]  The majority we've not had good interactions with.
[01:57:44.066 --> 01:57:44.846]  We do not support.
[01:57:45.518 --> 01:57:53.803]  Uh, but there are some that are good, but I've, I've interacted with a lot of Antifa and I can assure you that they were not Antifa that were on that front line in that Capitol, uh, that Capitol riot.
[01:57:53.803 --> 01:57:58.466]  So trying to find somebody to point fingers at, um, you're, you're failing when you're pointing at Antifa.
[01:57:58.466 --> 01:57:59.307]  They were not there.
[01:57:59.307 --> 01:58:00.207]  Oh, I'm failing.
[01:58:00.207 --> 01:58:03.369]  Even though they arrested an Antifa leader that said he brought a hundred there.
[01:58:03.369 --> 01:58:06.071]  I saw a bunch of skinny jean guys helping do it.
[01:58:06.071 --> 01:58:08.032]  Oh, so this was all Trump people.
[01:58:08.032 --> 01:58:09.993]  Yeah, it's, it's called, it's called an off balance.
[01:58:09.993 --> 01:58:11.154]  The same thing that you preach about.
[01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:13.996]  What's an op?
[01:58:13.996 --> 01:58:15.017]  It's not.
[01:58:15.017 --> 01:58:15.597]  It's not.
[01:58:15.597 --> 01:58:20.960]  It's simply not true.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:26.083]  Oh, so, okay, so should Trump be arrested for inciting this?
[01:58:26.083 --> 01:58:28.205]  I think there are a lot of other crimes that Trump should be arrested for.
[01:58:28.205 --> 01:58:35.669]  I don't believe he incited the insurrection at the Capitol, no, but I believe there's a lot of other crimes he should be arrested for.
[01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:38.571]  So, have you ever met, have you ever talked to Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:58:41.559 --> 01:58:42.340]  I don't believe so.
[01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.626]  Maybe I talk to a lot of people, a lot of people call me, ask questions, reporters, agencies.
[01:58:46.626 --> 01:58:49.170]  I have no clue.
[01:58:49.170 --> 01:58:51.193]  Oh, and you want to put any bookends on this?
[01:58:51.193 --> 01:58:54.417]  I mean, I just, this is just a mess.
[01:58:54.417 --> 01:58:55.158]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[01:58:56.973 --> 01:58:59.916]  I think we're obsessing a little bit too much over January 6th.
[01:58:59.916 --> 01:59:03.280]  You had Democrat riots, $2.2 billion in property damage.
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:06.784]  Most of it, if not all of it, private businesses, aside from maybe a couple government entities.
[01:59:06.784 --> 01:59:09.427]  I know there was a police station in Seattle.
[01:59:09.427 --> 01:59:11.430]  And that barely gets scolded by the media.
[01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:12.210]  So here's the problem.
[01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:16.994]  We are not in a position to launch any sort of kinetic war.
[01:59:16.994 --> 01:59:22.598]  Most of the population in America doesn't have a clue what's going on, and the media will turn them against you as soon as you do that.
[01:59:22.598 --> 01:59:24.139]  January 6th is the perfect example.
[01:59:24.139 --> 01:59:25.760]  So, here's my problem.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:28.362]  We are now out of the age of the Trump presidency.
[01:59:28.362 --> 01:59:29.723]  The polarization of that is done.
[01:59:30.143 --> 01:59:37.426]  I couldn't go interact or interface with BLM or Antifa without being attacked, them calling me racist, all this stuff, because I support Trump.
[01:59:37.426 --> 01:59:38.227]  Oh, I'm a Nazi.
[01:59:38.227 --> 01:59:38.907]  Well, I'm not.
[01:59:38.907 --> 01:59:40.247]  I never was any of that stuff.
[01:59:40.247 --> 01:59:42.348]  So now I'm saying we all need to be unified.
[01:59:42.348 --> 01:59:43.689]  We're all anti-establishment.
[01:59:43.689 --> 01:59:45.370]  I think we can all agree the media is corrupt.
[01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:46.870]  We can all agree politicians are corrupt.
[01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:47.851]  So now we have to become unified.
[01:59:47.851 --> 01:59:48.031]  I agree.
[01:59:48.031 --> 01:59:54.674]  Trump being gone is a positive so we can organize against the wars, against the surveillance, against the mask, against the forced inoculation.
[01:59:54.674 --> 01:59:56.415]  I think that's a positive thing.
[01:59:56.415 --> 01:59:58.155]  Let me ask Lord Boogaloo.
[01:59:58.155 --> 01:59:59.436]  Do you agree with that, Lord Boogaloo?
[02:00:00.552 --> 02:00:02.635]  So I'm 100% clear.
[02:00:02.635 --> 02:00:06.179]  You're cool with the tyranny if it's the tyranny that you like, which would be Donald Trump.
[02:00:06.179 --> 02:00:07.821]  I just want to make sure I'm tracking on that.
[02:00:07.821 --> 02:00:09.343]  So you're not actually against tyranny.
[02:00:09.343 --> 02:00:10.925]  You're not actually for revolution.
[02:00:10.925 --> 02:00:14.369]  You're only for doing it when somebody is in office that you don't agree with.
[02:00:14.369 --> 02:00:15.230]  Wait a minute.
[02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:15.871]  Wait a minute.
[02:00:15.871 --> 02:00:19.395]  I just talked about all of us unifying against forced inoculations and Joe Biden.
[02:00:19.395 --> 02:00:19.956]  Trump's gone.
[02:00:21.204 --> 02:00:24.405]  You wouldn't do it while Trump was in office because you didn't stand against Trump.
[02:00:24.405 --> 02:00:26.466]  You stood for the very time... But I didn't stand around.
[02:00:26.466 --> 02:00:31.547]  I didn't stand around with a gun in front of stuff and tell... Hold on.
[02:00:31.547 --> 02:00:34.988]  That's another cheap shot, Mr. Fireteam.
[02:00:34.988 --> 02:00:37.429]  We have fireteams in the Capitol.
[02:00:37.429 --> 02:00:39.170]  We have taken the Capitol.
[02:00:39.170 --> 02:00:41.750]  We are Commando Base Delta.
[02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:42.310]  Come on.
[02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:43.631]  Don't get mad, Mr. Dumb.
[02:00:43.631 --> 02:00:46.312]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[02:00:46.312 --> 02:00:46.772]  I tell ya.

[02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:13.752]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[02:01:13.752 --> 02:01:18.455]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[02:01:19.676 --> 02:01:20.416]  We're good.
[02:02:03.423 --> 02:02:08.324]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:02:08.324 --> 02:02:17.186]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:02:20.857 --> 02:02:28.944]  All right, we got Mike Dunn, one of the most prominent Boogaloos, with us.
[02:02:28.944 --> 02:02:31.946]  And again, he goes, oh, you sell products.
[02:02:31.946 --> 02:02:32.607]  You're discredited.
[02:02:33.584 --> 02:02:35.224]  That sounds like a communist statement.
[02:02:35.224 --> 02:02:39.605]  And then he, oh, we've got security for BLM, but we don't like the Proud Boys.
[02:02:39.605 --> 02:02:40.905]  And so he does these cheap shots.
[02:02:40.905 --> 02:02:42.346]  I was pretty nice to him earlier.
[02:02:42.346 --> 02:02:45.806]  I brought up some of his quotes and some of the things he said.
[02:02:45.806 --> 02:02:50.427]  And then I was simply, you know, coming out and saying, I don't think the attack on the Capitol was good.
[02:02:50.427 --> 02:02:51.687]  He overall, I think, agreed with that.
[02:02:51.687 --> 02:02:58.268]  But then, you know, came back that I'm just not willing to get my hands dirty because I'm a coward.
[02:02:58.268 --> 02:03:01.909]  But he said he doesn't support a Capitol attack because there's a law, you know, against guns in D.C.
[02:03:03.473 --> 02:03:09.035]  But then he kind of said that I was causing a problem.
[02:03:09.035 --> 02:03:12.556]  So I just wanted you to have some final comments.
[02:03:12.556 --> 02:03:13.997]  Hey, dude, if you're going to talk, close that door.
[02:03:13.997 --> 02:03:15.337]  Thanks.
[02:03:15.337 --> 02:03:16.578]  So that's where we are.
[02:03:16.578 --> 02:03:21.379]  Listen, I don't have a hard-on for the Boogaloos.
[02:03:21.379 --> 02:03:23.140]  I'm not against people doing open carry.
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:25.881]  I think it's a good idea to exercise our First Amendment, our Second Amendment.
[02:03:27.315 --> 02:03:29.637]  Both together at the same time.
[02:03:29.637 --> 02:03:40.686]  It's just that I really don't think a badly coordinated, sporadic shooting war with the local police is going to really put our revolution off on a good foot.
[02:03:41.345 --> 02:03:43.947]  And I know you're going to say that's not what you're part of.
[02:03:43.947 --> 02:03:52.493]  It's just, I'm simply here asking, if there were Boogaloos at the Capitol that day, and Boogaloos are telling us they're leading the way for revolution, you can't have it both ways.
[02:03:52.493 --> 02:04:00.960]  Like, were they leading the revolution in there, as the tweets could be seen as, or were they not leading it, and now they're not following the ideology they said they're part of?
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.463]  I would like to respond to what Owen said before the break.
[02:04:04.463 --> 02:04:06.684]  Yes, Lord Boogaloo, go ahead.
[02:04:06.684 --> 02:04:07.785]  You're awesome.
[02:04:07.785 --> 02:04:10.247]  So, basically,
[02:04:11.314 --> 02:04:13.016]  Owen was talking about.
[02:04:13.016 --> 02:04:16.979]  Owen, could you refresh that because now I just lost my train of thought.
[02:04:16.979 --> 02:04:18.000]  Well, let me just be clear.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.665]  You were saying, oh, you only support it when your guy's not in office.
[02:04:23.665 --> 02:04:25.647]  It's not that.
[02:04:25.647 --> 02:04:26.487]  But let me be clear.
[02:04:26.487 --> 02:04:27.248]  It's not that.
[02:04:27.248 --> 02:04:30.331]  I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it peacefully.
[02:04:30.331 --> 02:04:33.653]  I believe that Trump was hoped that we could do it politically from within.
[02:04:33.653 --> 02:04:34.234]  He's out now.
[02:04:34.234 --> 02:04:35.055]  So that hope's gone.
[02:04:35.635 --> 02:04:36.335]  So that's what I'm saying.
[02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:37.576]  Now we're in a new age.
[02:04:37.576 --> 02:04:42.198]  We should all be unifying, having real intellectual debates about what a revolution looks like to save this country.
[02:04:42.198 --> 02:04:44.059]  Yeah, what was the Trump fascism?
[02:04:44.059 --> 02:04:44.699]  Like, Trump's gone.
[02:04:44.699 --> 02:04:47.400]  It's like, you support Trump and his police state.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.162]  What the hell does that mean?
[02:04:50.162 --> 02:05:00.266]  Oh, and until you vote somebody else in, that continues to do the same thing while saying, hey, we're against voter fraud, but then actually partaking in the very system that continues to destroy the U.S.
[02:05:00.266 --> 02:05:01.547]  and the freedoms that we hold so dear.
[02:05:02.205 --> 02:05:12.374]  Um, so, the problem is, Owen, and it's the same thing I've seen with Republicans across the border, people who identify as conservative or white being, um, is that you're all for unity when it fits your idea.
[02:05:12.374 --> 02:05:17.798]  You're all for, oh, let's ally with Black Lives Matter, or let's be friends with Black Lives Matter because we've got to stand against the government.
[02:05:17.798 --> 02:05:20.781]  Because Joe Biden's in office and his administration controls.
[02:05:20.781 --> 02:05:23.743]  Where was that unity when Trump, uh, infringed upon the Second Amendment?
[02:05:23.743 --> 02:05:25.144]  But, but, but that's not fair, though.
[02:05:25.144 --> 02:05:29.148]  Mike, that's not fair because- I didn't work with Black Lives Matter, you did, Boogie Lou!
[02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:31.311]  Mike, that's not fair.
[02:05:31.311 --> 02:05:32.732]  I had nothing against these groups.
[02:05:32.732 --> 02:05:33.532]  I'm telling you.
[02:05:33.532 --> 02:05:35.273]  I would go out to try to talk to them.
[02:05:35.273 --> 02:05:36.053]  I'm on video.
[02:05:36.053 --> 02:05:37.754]  Hours of video where I try to talk to them.
[02:05:37.754 --> 02:05:38.594]  They call me a Nazi.
[02:05:38.594 --> 02:05:39.714]  They call me racist.
[02:05:39.714 --> 02:05:41.375]  So, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[02:05:41.375 --> 02:05:44.016]  I did try the unity when Trump was in office.
[02:05:44.016 --> 02:05:46.156]  Hey, Owen, they've called me the same thing.
[02:05:46.156 --> 02:05:50.318]  It's all in the way you portray yourself and how you... Oh, let's ask this question in closing.
[02:05:50.318 --> 02:05:51.398]  Let's ask this question...
[02:05:52.623 --> 02:05:52.883]  All right.
[02:06:09.978 --> 02:06:16.743]  Lower bodies, the people that are subject to this globalism that you speak of, and this elitist mentality that is running the U.S.
[02:06:16.743 --> 02:06:26.770]  through our governmental officials, is unifying those people and getting ready to stand physically to defend our rights, our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:06:26.770 --> 02:06:29.412]  Well, I mean, I think people have a right to stand up, and I think they should.
[02:06:29.412 --> 02:06:33.875]  Let me ask you this, have you been contacted by the FBI?
[02:06:33.875 --> 02:06:34.416]  Yes, I have.
[02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:40.932]  You know, you haven't been questioned.
[02:06:40.932 --> 02:06:43.894]  So the FBI has been all over us.
[02:06:43.894 --> 02:06:45.195]  So what did the FBI say?
[02:06:45.195 --> 02:06:48.236]  What did they come to you about?
[02:06:48.236 --> 02:06:49.877]  They like asking questions.
[02:06:49.877 --> 02:06:50.298]  That's all.
[02:06:50.298 --> 02:06:51.859]  And I don't like giving them answers.
[02:06:51.859 --> 02:06:54.300]  So if that paints a good picture for you, I hope it does.
[02:06:57.076 --> 02:07:04.963]  Well, I just think what happened at the Capitol was called screwing the pooch, and it ruined the great thing we had set up, and it gave the left a major victory.
[02:07:04.963 --> 02:07:08.306]  What do you think of the Q movement, Mr. Dunn?
[02:07:08.306 --> 02:07:11.409]  I think a lot of it is found in baseless conspiracies.
[02:07:11.409 --> 02:07:17.615]  I think there are one or two things that might be true, but for the most part, it's just a baseless conspiracy idea.
[02:07:20.742 --> 02:07:24.603]  Well, I get a group of armed Americans that are non-political and just want their freedom.
[02:07:24.603 --> 02:07:26.244]  So I get the need for that.
[02:07:26.244 --> 02:07:34.027]  I just think that you guys are kind of putting yourselves in uniform, like the last uniform you want is one that stands out.
[02:07:34.027 --> 02:07:38.428]  And then anybody can put on a Hawaiian shirt and go out and do terrible things.
[02:07:38.428 --> 02:07:41.549]  I think like the Cubans or anything.
[02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:43.610]  To a certain extent, Alex, I do agree with you there.
[02:07:43.610 --> 02:07:45.571]  The thing is, though, is that
[02:07:46.641 --> 02:07:51.285]  And once again, no offense to you directly, but your generation and the ones before you, they've put it on my generation's heads.
[02:07:51.285 --> 02:07:52.306]  And so we have to stand up.
[02:07:52.306 --> 02:07:57.149]  So if you haven't solved the problem, you can't come at us for trying to solve the problem a different way.
[02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:58.791]  Um, you, you cannot attack me.
[02:07:58.791 --> 02:08:02.494]  I mean, so, so, so, okay.
[02:08:02.494 --> 02:08:03.454]  I'm just saying the local.
[02:08:04.605 --> 02:08:06.545]  The Capitol is a symbol of us voting.
[02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:09.266]  Just because it's been captured doesn't mean we attack that.
[02:08:09.266 --> 02:08:10.446]  The New World Order.
[02:08:10.446 --> 02:08:11.767]  I'm not trying to get you to go attack people.
[02:08:11.767 --> 02:08:20.289]  I'm just saying, if I saw a movement saying, we're going after Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds, the New World Order and the CFR building in New York, I'd say, those guys are real.
[02:08:20.289 --> 02:08:21.909]  They're about to get a fight.
[02:08:21.909 --> 02:08:27.431]  Because about 10 minutes after you said that, they would be having the HRT SWAT teams will be coming after your ass.
[02:08:27.431 --> 02:08:28.991]  Within a day, you're going to get SWAT teams.
[02:08:30.154 --> 02:08:31.375]  Alex, what have I said repeatedly?
[02:08:31.375 --> 02:08:35.879]  I have said repeatedly that we stand against the vocalists and the elites that continue to control this country.
[02:08:35.879 --> 02:08:39.982]  So when you're saying, oh, if I saw people that were on earth with that, we literally stand against it.
[02:08:39.982 --> 02:08:42.244]  We stand against the pedophilia that's prevalent in Hollywood.
[02:08:42.244 --> 02:08:44.886]  We stand against media controlling people.
[02:08:44.886 --> 02:08:46.627]  We stand against the elites that run our government.
[02:08:46.627 --> 02:08:48.829]  We stand against the money that run our government.
[02:08:48.829 --> 02:08:52.172]  It's just that we're doing it in a slightly different way than what you agree with.
[02:08:52.172 --> 02:08:56.916]  All I wanted to come on here and say, Alex, if you'll allow me to finish real quick, all I wanted to come on here and say, man, is
[02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:57.916]  Oh, I'm controlled opposition!
[02:09:27.245 --> 02:09:28.952]  You think I'm controlled?
[02:09:28.952 --> 02:09:29.815]  Who gives me my orders?
[02:09:29.815 --> 02:09:30.337]  Please tell me.
[02:09:31.892 --> 02:09:34.633]  I do believe you're 100% controlled opposition, Alex.
[02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:42.755]  That's why you'll never preach anything besides peaceful and legal, lawful, wonderful, hunky-dory ways of protest.
[02:09:42.755 --> 02:09:55.638]  Okay, so I'm not the one saying we've got fireteams in the Capitol, and then you guys haven't been indicted, and then they're trying to indict me, and then you're sitting there literally saying I'm getting orders from a higher-level group, which is not the case.
[02:09:55.638 --> 02:09:56.758]  Look at my eyes.
[02:09:56.758 --> 02:09:58.219]  I take orders from God, that's it.
[02:09:58.219 --> 02:09:58.679]  You understand that?
[02:09:59.957 --> 02:10:03.279]  You fired the one good man you had and that was David Knight.
[02:10:03.279 --> 02:10:05.640]  I do believe you're a controlled opposition, Alex.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:12.124]  David Knight does not support offensive violence.
[02:10:12.124 --> 02:10:13.745]  I mean, I like David.
[02:10:13.745 --> 02:10:15.466]  David did not like our support of Trump.
[02:10:15.466 --> 02:10:16.106]  He was upset.
[02:10:16.106 --> 02:10:17.907]  That's why I let him go.
[02:10:17.907 --> 02:10:19.408]  Other way around, he wasn't happy here.
[02:10:22.406 --> 02:10:27.367]  Let me just say this.
[02:10:27.367 --> 02:10:29.107]  I've worked at InfoWars for five years.
[02:10:29.107 --> 02:10:32.508]  I can guarantee you there's nobody controlling Alex Jones.
[02:10:32.508 --> 02:10:35.129]  I've had screaming matches with Alex Jones about stuff.
[02:10:35.129 --> 02:10:36.329]  Okay, so trust me.
[02:10:36.329 --> 02:10:38.009]  Nobody controls what goes on here.
[02:10:38.009 --> 02:10:39.450]  Half the time we're like Joe Biden.
[02:10:39.450 --> 02:10:41.190]  We can't even put a pen in our pocket.
[02:10:41.190 --> 02:10:42.930]  Okay, that's how real this is.
[02:10:42.930 --> 02:10:45.331]  Now guys, we need to stop bickering about all this crap.
[02:10:45.331 --> 02:10:46.691]  This is exactly what the globalists want.
[02:10:47.091 --> 02:10:47.811]  We need unity.
[02:10:47.811 --> 02:10:49.772]  I say, oh, you want unity under Biden.
[02:10:49.772 --> 02:10:51.353]  I believe Trump, we could have peace.
[02:10:51.353 --> 02:10:52.353]  I believe Trump, we could do this.
[02:10:52.353 --> 02:10:53.654]  He tried to stop wars.
[02:10:53.654 --> 02:10:54.454]  He did stop the wars.
[02:10:54.454 --> 02:10:55.575]  He didn't start any new wars.
[02:10:55.575 --> 02:10:56.835]  Trump did some good things.
[02:10:56.835 --> 02:10:58.996]  So it's not to sit here and say, oh, it's just when Biden's.
[02:10:58.996 --> 02:11:00.977]  I've never been a violent revolutionary.
[02:11:00.977 --> 02:11:03.138]  I've been arrested for my peaceful protest.
[02:11:03.138 --> 02:11:14.302]  I'm calling for, we have to awaken 50 million, 100 million, 200 million Americans before you can ever even think about doing a finger lick of violence in this country and have a chance at victory.
[02:11:14.302 --> 02:11:15.163]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:11:15.703 --> 02:11:16.403]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:11:16.403 --> 02:11:19.845]  We've done some good radio here and had some thought-provoking things.
[02:11:19.845 --> 02:11:21.646]  And, Don, I'm not going to do cheap shots like you did.
[02:11:21.646 --> 02:11:26.449]  I think you're a well-spoken person, and I think you believe what you're saying.
[02:11:26.449 --> 02:11:30.791]  And so we'll continue to watch the situation as it unfolds, and I appreciate you coming up here and defending your ideas.
[02:11:30.791 --> 02:11:31.692]  That's all I can say.
[02:11:31.692 --> 02:11:34.433]  But, yeah, it's pretty hilarious.
[02:11:34.433 --> 02:11:35.634]  I built this whole thing myself.
[02:11:35.634 --> 02:11:36.834]  I did it with our listeners.
[02:11:36.834 --> 02:11:41.557]  And I'm so proud of the fact that I'm independent, and I don't trust people that aren't independent, and that's what we're all about.
[02:11:41.957 --> 02:11:47.180]  All right, we got Pete Santilli chiming in, then we've got Leo Zagami on the fall of the Italian government.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:48.921]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:50.102]  I've got some bad news.
[02:11:50.102 --> 02:11:58.386]  Our best-selling vitamin-mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[02:11:58.386 --> 02:11:59.847]  But here's the good news.
[02:11:59.847 --> 02:12:08.112]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[02:12:08.832 --> 02:12:14.496]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:12:14.496 --> 02:12:15.196]  People love it.
[02:12:15.196 --> 02:12:16.537]  That's selling out.
[02:12:16.537 --> 02:12:19.859]  But despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[02:12:19.859 --> 02:12:23.922]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:12:23.922 --> 02:12:26.183]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:12:26.183 --> 02:12:26.984]  People really love it.
[02:12:26.984 --> 02:12:28.785]  It's extremely strong as well.
[02:12:28.785 --> 02:12:29.885]  It's selling out.
[02:12:29.885 --> 02:12:32.967]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[02:12:32.967 --> 02:12:36.850]  It also funds the InfoWar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:39.092]  So thank you all for your support.

[02:12:48.642 --> 02:12:50.304]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:12:50.304 --> 02:12:51.706]  Thank you for holding.
[02:12:51.706 --> 02:12:52.447]  How you doing Alex?
[02:12:53.226 --> 02:12:54.647]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:12:54.647 --> 02:12:55.868]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:12:55.868 --> 02:12:56.588]  How are you?
[02:12:56.588 --> 02:12:57.388]  I love you, man.
[02:12:57.388 --> 02:12:59.369]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:12:59.369 --> 02:13:01.591]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:13:01.591 --> 02:13:18.060]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:13:18.695 --> 02:13:24.117]  And it helps channel that zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:13:24.117 --> 02:13:37.602]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's only costing like 50 bucks.
[02:13:37.602 --> 02:13:42.303]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:13:42.303 --> 02:13:43.764]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:13:51.826 --> 02:13:59.889]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:59.889 --> 02:14:14.553]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another
[02:14:24.718 --> 02:14:40.733]  Okay, so we just had Mike Dunn, the leader of the Boogaloo Boys, on for a lengthy hour-long interview, and he didn't deny that these are his tweets and his parlor comments, but he says when they said they were in the capital, they meant the capital of DC.
[02:14:40.733 --> 02:14:41.393]  Well, funny.
[02:14:41.393 --> 02:14:42.835]  He doesn't deny these are his.
[02:14:42.835 --> 02:14:45.497]  On screen, please.
[02:14:45.497 --> 02:14:46.138]  Listen to this.
[02:14:46.138 --> 02:14:47.018]  Scroll down, guys.
[02:14:47.018 --> 02:14:47.419]  Parlor.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:50.760]  He deleted all this later.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:53.201]  The Last Sons of Liberty.
[02:14:53.201 --> 02:14:54.741]  Official statement.
[02:14:54.741 --> 02:15:02.043]  Boogaloo Boys associated with the Last Sons of Liberty played an important part in the breach of the Capitol.
[02:15:02.043 --> 02:15:10.665]  Any movement to be used to throw a middle finger to tyranny should be capitalized on.
[02:15:10.665 --> 02:15:17.026]  Yesterday, when presented with the moment, Undercover Boys
[02:15:18.763 --> 02:15:19.303]  We're good to go.
[02:15:41.254 --> 02:15:44.496]  Who provided Overwatch along with direction.
[02:15:44.496 --> 02:15:53.341]  This video does not incriminate anyone of ours and wasn't sent to us, was sent to us by anonymous by Last Son's Boogaloo Boys.
[02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:56.823]  This is our footage, Mike Dunn.
[02:15:56.823 --> 02:15:58.504]  And he didn't deny that's his.
[02:15:58.504 --> 02:16:02.866]  So, he lied in front of everyone.
[02:16:02.866 --> 02:16:05.368]  He's a disgusting little rat.
[02:16:05.368 --> 02:16:07.229]  And I challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow.
[02:16:09.090 --> 02:16:12.914]  Because I meant to get to this and I forgot about it while it was on.
[02:16:12.914 --> 02:16:18.580]  And so these guys all have these illusions of grandeur that all these armed people are under them and oh they've got all this power and all this.
[02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:29.312]  They gave a home run, devastating defeat to what Trump and I wanted, who he admits he hates, to try to have a 10 day investigation of election fraud that we all need as Americans.
[02:16:29.312 --> 02:16:30.934]  And then he calls it cowardly.
[02:16:32.005 --> 02:16:34.966]  Just like Pchenix on, he goes, you never learned in the military.
[02:16:34.966 --> 02:16:38.448]  Trump will still be in January 20th, you don't know.
[02:16:38.448 --> 02:16:41.789]  Same guy like, you're a generation failed, I'm a commando.
[02:16:41.789 --> 02:16:43.670]  I'm doing all this stuff, give me a break.
[02:16:43.670 --> 02:16:48.012]  In fact, I challenge Mike Dunne to a bare knuckles boxing match in a ring.
[02:16:48.012 --> 02:16:48.952]  I'm 47, he's 27.
[02:16:48.952 --> 02:16:52.293]  I mean, he thinks he's so fricking tough all day long.
[02:16:52.293 --> 02:16:54.054]  Let's do it, get the money to charity.
[02:16:54.054 --> 02:16:58.736]  I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys running their fat mouths all day about how badass they are.
[02:17:00.299 --> 02:17:03.686]  Now does that mean I want to go to war with every person in the boogaloo movement?
[02:17:03.686 --> 02:17:07.374]  No, but you're being manipulated like the feds did to the militias in the 1990s.
[02:17:09.301 --> 02:17:19.024]  And I do not respect that type of crap right there, when he said they went in that Capitol, and they were proud of it, and he deleted it now, to sit there and lie to every one of us.
[02:17:19.024 --> 02:17:20.124]  It's disgusting.
[02:17:20.124 --> 02:17:21.424]  And I wish I'd have said it when he was on.
[02:17:21.424 --> 02:17:22.845]  I forgot to get to that.
[02:17:22.845 --> 02:17:24.125]  Holy Toledo.
[02:17:24.125 --> 02:17:32.147]  Owen Schroer, we got Pete Santilli coming on, who they tried to set up as a journalist and put in prison with the whole Bundy Ranch and then the Oregon situation.
[02:17:32.147 --> 02:17:33.467]  We'll go to him in a moment.
[02:17:33.467 --> 02:17:35.668]  But holy hell, I've forgotten all this.
[02:17:36.368 --> 02:17:39.134]  I mean, he's right there saying this is a great thing.
[02:17:39.134 --> 02:17:40.957]  And maybe he's right in his view.
[02:17:40.957 --> 02:17:42.961]  But don't lie to us and tell us it's not the case.
[02:17:43.553 --> 02:17:47.056]  Oh, but Alex, don't forget, you're controlled opposition, so what can I say here?
[02:17:47.056 --> 02:17:49.138]  No, look, I'll be honest with you, Alex.
[02:17:49.138 --> 02:17:53.642]  Well, climb in the ring with the controlled opposition and see what happens to your ass.
[02:17:53.642 --> 02:17:57.365]  I'm being facetious here, I'm being facetious, but Alex, I'll be honest.
[02:17:57.365 --> 02:18:01.729]  I think you're being a little too hard on Mike, and I'm not disagreeing with the facts you're laying out.
[02:18:01.729 --> 02:18:06.474]  I just feel that we're discounting one fact here because we've been so gaslit by the media
[02:18:07.034 --> 02:18:10.477]  That you do have a million and a half Trump supporters out there.
[02:18:10.477 --> 02:18:14.400]  I'm not even talking about the Boogaloo Boys, or whatever they did that day.
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.423]  I'm talking about a million and a half Trump people that were in D.C.
[02:18:17.423 --> 02:18:28.452]  I'm talking about probably 75 million plus minimum, maybe even 100 million people voted for Trump, I'm not even kidding you with how much election fraud, that know our election was stolen, and for them this is like
[02:18:29.133 --> 02:18:32.015]  This is like a wave of the reality hitting them.
[02:18:32.015 --> 02:18:33.075]  No, no, I agree.
[02:18:33.075 --> 02:18:34.236]  People should be pissed.
[02:18:34.236 --> 02:18:37.178]  I'm not surprised they stormed the Capitol and tricked our folks to do it.
[02:18:37.178 --> 02:18:37.558]  I get it.
[02:18:37.558 --> 02:18:40.059]  We bet pedophiles everywhere, New World Order.
[02:18:40.059 --> 02:18:41.480]  I get his point if he's legitimate.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:43.221]  Maybe he's real, okay?
[02:18:43.221 --> 02:18:47.344]  And he has a perspective, a Declaration of Independence, and maybe he's right.
[02:18:47.344 --> 02:18:50.926]  I'm just saying, don't claim you went to the Capitol and did all this, and then later tell us you didn't.
[02:18:52.076 --> 02:18:54.818]  Yeah, I think, I mean, he's going to have to speak for himself and his actions.
[02:18:54.818 --> 02:18:57.459]  I don't know what, there may be an investigation into him or not.
[02:18:57.459 --> 02:18:58.720]  I'm not trying to get him in trouble.
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:00.941]  The worst these people deserve is a trespassing thing.
[02:19:00.941 --> 02:19:02.642]  They're not terrorists.
[02:19:02.642 --> 02:19:08.145]  Yeah, and so, but see, that's the question here, and I don't know if he's had to go through this intellectually if he's made statements.
[02:19:08.145 --> 02:19:09.105]  We've been there.
[02:19:09.105 --> 02:19:11.747]  I mean, you've got to ask yourself a question and make a decision.
[02:19:11.747 --> 02:19:13.308]  I've had to do this multiple times.
[02:19:13.308 --> 02:19:15.029]  Are you willing to go to jail?
[02:19:15.749 --> 02:19:18.150]  Are you willing to go to jail for something?
[02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:20.470]  And do you think it'll have a lasting impact?
[02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:23.091]  Or better yet, are you willing to die?
[02:19:23.091 --> 02:19:26.732]  And do you think your death will have a lasting impact or will you have died in vain?
[02:19:26.732 --> 02:19:30.093]  I mean, so these are the questions that are at the top of this intellectual debate.
[02:19:30.093 --> 02:19:32.493]  And at the bottom is, hey, how can we have unity?
[02:19:32.493 --> 02:19:34.274]  How can I come together with the Boogaloo Boys?
[02:19:34.274 --> 02:19:35.834]  How can I come together with Black Lives Matter?
[02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:37.274]  How can I come together with Antifa?
[02:19:37.274 --> 02:19:39.195]  Yeah, I believe Trump was going to have a chance.
[02:19:39.195 --> 02:19:40.495]  We have a giant pecker.
[02:19:40.495 --> 02:19:42.936]  You fight the Antifa champion, I fight Mike Dunn.
[02:19:43.576 --> 02:19:49.023]  And then we clink glasses and realize, you know what, we're all anti-establishment, maybe we're not so bad.
[02:19:49.023 --> 02:19:49.905]  Mike accepts!
[02:19:52.059 --> 02:19:53.240]  Well, uh, hey, you know what?
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:54.841]  I've been trying to do political boxing.
[02:19:54.841 --> 02:19:55.502]  See, but here's the problem.
[02:19:55.502 --> 02:19:56.843]  That's my point, though, Alex.
[02:19:56.843 --> 02:19:59.045]  At least he comes on air!
[02:19:59.045 --> 02:19:59.965]  At least they come on air!
[02:19:59.965 --> 02:20:02.047]  I've been watching the Jake Paul and his brother.
[02:20:02.047 --> 02:20:02.848]  I want to do this.
[02:20:02.848 --> 02:20:03.388]  I mean, honestly.
[02:20:03.388 --> 02:20:05.970]  And I've got to fight like some championship badass black dude.
[02:20:05.970 --> 02:20:08.152]  I've got to fight little Tubby Bubby.
[02:20:08.152 --> 02:20:09.273]  I'm ready.
[02:20:09.273 --> 02:20:10.914]  But Alex, at least he comes on air.
[02:20:10.914 --> 02:20:12.596]  We played the clip of Joy Reid.
[02:20:12.596 --> 02:20:13.737]  You showed Jim Acosta.
[02:20:13.737 --> 02:20:15.098]  You showed Anderson Cooper.
[02:20:15.098 --> 02:20:15.938]  You showed Don Lemon.
[02:20:15.938 --> 02:20:16.979]  You showed Rachel Maddow.
[02:20:16.979 --> 02:20:18.741]  Those are the cowards.
[02:20:18.741 --> 02:20:20.322]  Those are the frauds.
[02:20:20.322 --> 02:20:21.523]  Those are the liars.
[02:20:21.883 --> 02:20:25.586]  Those are the enemies of free speech, the enemies of truth, and the enemies of America.
[02:20:25.586 --> 02:20:27.247]  I'm not calling for violence against them.
[02:20:27.247 --> 02:20:28.428]  I want to expose them.
[02:20:28.428 --> 02:20:35.354]  That's why they censor us on the internet, because they know that's the path to real victory, is exposing them and uniting the people against them.
[02:20:35.354 --> 02:20:37.996]  I agree, but what state has legal bare knuckles boxing?
[02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:40.618]  I think Texas has mutual combat.
[02:20:40.618 --> 02:20:42.019]  We do?
[02:20:42.019 --> 02:20:43.060]  Alright.
[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:46.883]  I'll get worn out with some gloves, but as long as it's bare knuckles, I'm not worried.
[02:20:46.883 --> 02:20:49.125]  I don't know, there's states that still have mutual combat laws.
[02:20:50.851 --> 02:20:53.312]  But that's not what you want mutual combat.
[02:20:53.312 --> 02:20:54.973]  Actually, people don't know.
[02:20:54.973 --> 02:20:55.914]  People think I'm full of talk.
[02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:57.195]  I need to start getting a ring with some people.
[02:20:57.195 --> 02:21:00.857]  This is going to boost my ratings massively.
[02:21:00.857 --> 02:21:06.060]  Maybe you have him if he wants to do it, but really it should be you and Chunk Yogurt or Brian Stelter.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:07.560]  I mean, that's the match that people want to see.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.061]  I agree.
[02:21:08.061 --> 02:21:09.542]  I will take on Sink Yogurt.
[02:21:10.749 --> 02:21:14.832]  Uh, and of the Young Turds, and I'll take on the guy who looks like a pedophile but isn't.
[02:21:14.832 --> 02:21:17.735]  I mean, I was just saying, if I was casting people as a pedophile, it would be Brian Stelter.
[02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:20.777]  I will take on Mike Dunn, Brian Stelter, and St.
[02:21:20.777 --> 02:21:22.839]  Ugar all at the same time.
[02:21:22.839 --> 02:21:27.302]  But I get a baseball bat with nails in it.
[02:21:27.302 --> 02:21:29.824]  And all they get is trash can lids.
[02:21:29.824 --> 02:21:34.387]  Well, I mean, here's the thing, and uh... By the way, this is all a joke, folks.
[02:21:34.387 --> 02:21:36.249]  I'm scared of Mike Dunn.
[02:21:36.249 --> 02:21:38.391]  One look at him, I, at a fundamental level,
[02:21:39.241 --> 02:21:41.242]  I like, deep down I get scared.
[02:21:41.242 --> 02:21:42.682]  Well Alex, here's my thing.
[02:21:42.682 --> 02:21:43.643]  I love... I'm backing out.
[02:21:43.643 --> 02:21:44.923]  Mike's too powerful.
[02:21:44.923 --> 02:21:46.144]  I love debate.
[02:21:46.144 --> 02:21:46.544]  I love it.
[02:21:46.544 --> 02:21:47.944]  I love people to disagree with me.
[02:21:47.944 --> 02:21:49.345]  I believe in my intellect and my logic.
[02:21:49.345 --> 02:21:52.086]  No, I'm just saying they want this violence so it's a joke.
[02:21:52.086 --> 02:21:53.647]  But that's my point is that... Obviously I'm backing down.
[02:21:53.647 --> 02:21:57.468]  That dude, that dude looks like freaking Mike Tyson.
[02:21:57.468 --> 02:21:59.749]  The point is that we're... Actually, I pissed my pants earlier.
[02:21:59.749 --> 02:22:01.770]  Did you know I actually have urine all over me right now?
[02:22:01.770 --> 02:22:02.150]  Prove it.
[02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.490]  Let's see.
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:04.111]  Stand up.
[02:22:04.111 --> 02:22:04.411]  Oh, it's true.
[02:22:04.411 --> 02:22:05.291]  Let's see the britches.
[02:22:05.291 --> 02:22:05.712]  It's embarrassing.
[02:22:05.712 --> 02:22:06.452]  Let's see the britches.
[02:22:07.843 --> 02:22:09.204]  I'm embarrassed right now.
[02:22:09.204 --> 02:22:10.285]  Alright.
[02:22:10.285 --> 02:22:12.186]  Alright.
[02:22:12.186 --> 02:22:17.649]  You urinated, you defecated all over yourself.
[02:22:17.649 --> 02:22:20.670]  You know, I'd feel sorry for Mike if I went like that under his nose.
[02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:23.352]  It would just not be very nice.
[02:22:23.352 --> 02:22:24.813]  Nah, but I'm telling you man, Mike.
[02:22:24.813 --> 02:22:26.094]  Hey look, Mike.
[02:22:26.094 --> 02:22:27.034]  I'm gonna have it twice.
[02:22:27.034 --> 02:22:28.615]  The nose bone sticks in the hand.
[02:22:28.615 --> 02:22:30.276]  I don't believe that Mike is the enemy.
[02:22:30.276 --> 02:22:31.797]  I don't believe the Boogaloo Boys are the enemy.
[02:22:31.797 --> 02:22:33.037]  I actually love Mike!
[02:22:33.037 --> 02:22:33.918]  Actually, here's the thing.
[02:22:33.918 --> 02:22:35.419]  Me and Mike have been dating for a long time.
[02:22:36.229 --> 02:22:38.031]  And he left me a while back.
[02:22:38.031 --> 02:22:41.854]  We're Southern Poverty Law Center workers and Morris Deese is our daddy.
[02:22:41.854 --> 02:22:42.995]  He's our leather daddy.
[02:22:42.995 --> 02:22:44.737]  He wears a leather outfit.
[02:22:44.737 --> 02:22:47.019]  He has a little bull-webby pops.
[02:22:47.019 --> 02:22:55.487]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:22:55.487 --> 02:22:56.308]  Kava is one of the
[02:22:56.608 --> 02:22:57.148]  We're good to go.
[02:23:15.996 --> 02:23:21.983]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[02:23:21.983 --> 02:23:26.829]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[02:23:26.829 --> 02:23:35.019]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[02:23:35.419 --> 02:23:39.503]  German chamomile, organic skullcap and valerian root.
[02:23:39.503 --> 02:23:46.691]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:23:49.966 --> 02:24:01.431]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history, I've interviewed all the experts, I have looked at every facet of this, and now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[02:24:01.431 --> 02:24:03.632]  That's how they changed the subject from election fraud.
[02:24:03.632 --> 02:24:06.033]  It's how they changed the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[02:24:06.033 --> 02:24:11.936]  It's how they changed the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[02:24:12.376 --> 02:24:21.966]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19, and that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[02:24:21.966 --> 02:24:29.433]  They train you to stay in your houses, they train you to be tracked, they train you to do what you're told for 9-10 months as training wheels, and now they launch the storm.
[02:24:29.433 --> 02:24:31.595]  The storm is here.
[02:24:31.595 --> 02:24:32.636]  It's a globalist storm.
[02:24:33.337 --> 02:24:35.398]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[02:24:35.398 --> 02:24:37.620]  There's going to be martial law for the globalists.
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:38.981]  They're trying to set you up.
[02:24:38.981 --> 02:24:40.842]  Don't be involved in violence.
[02:24:40.842 --> 02:24:44.525]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[02:24:44.525 --> 02:24:45.905]  That's how we beat these people.
[02:24:45.905 --> 02:24:46.486]  With truth.
[02:25:03.257 --> 02:25:03.777]  We're good to go!
[02:25:32.188 --> 02:25:40.695]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:25:40.695 --> 02:25:50.143]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:25:50.143 --> 02:25:52.766]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:11.223 --> 02:26:14.467]  Alright, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:26:14.467 --> 02:26:17.551]  And I want to be clear, that's why we got Pete Santilli coming on right now.
[02:26:17.551 --> 02:26:23.858]  I'm not believing Reuters that Enrique Tarrio is a federal informant for drug stuff in Miami.
[02:26:23.858 --> 02:26:24.859]  But you know he did get...
[02:26:25.777 --> 02:26:28.360]  Set up for selling resale medical equipment.
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:28.861]  I looked it up.
[02:26:28.861 --> 02:26:30.042]  That was all BS.
[02:26:30.042 --> 02:26:31.064]  I think Enrique is a good guy.
[02:26:31.064 --> 02:26:32.746]  I've had dinner with him three or four times.
[02:26:32.746 --> 02:26:35.429]  Hung out with him in Austin.
[02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:36.150]  I like Joe Biggs.
[02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:37.892]  He's been arrested by the FBI on this whole deal.
[02:26:37.892 --> 02:26:38.673]  I know Joe's good.
[02:26:38.673 --> 02:26:39.855]  He wasn't violent.
[02:26:39.855 --> 02:26:40.535]  So I want to be clear.
[02:26:40.535 --> 02:26:41.156]  When I say
[02:26:41.977 --> 02:26:45.119]  That they had people infiltrating the Proud Boys.
[02:26:45.119 --> 02:26:46.440]  That's because it's a fact.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:49.402]  And we know some people posing as Proud Boys did go into the Capitol.
[02:26:49.402 --> 02:26:51.503]  And I just want people going forward to be aware of this.
[02:26:51.503 --> 02:26:55.226]  As for the Boogaloos, I know that's a very, very diverse group of people.
[02:26:55.226 --> 02:26:59.849]  And I think Mike Dunn, you know, overall tried to really square up and do a major debate with me.
[02:26:59.849 --> 02:27:01.150]  And he was fair to come on the show.
[02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:07.292]  But the larger issues of what he did, saying I'm a Fed and all this other stuff, there's no proof of that.
[02:27:07.292 --> 02:27:08.412]  It's not true.
[02:27:08.412 --> 02:27:15.734]  All I'm saying is, we don't need to invade capitals and give the left the pretext to have a major clampdown on this country.
[02:27:15.734 --> 02:27:16.994]  And that's my common sense.
[02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:18.755]  That's not me afraid of conflict.
[02:27:18.755 --> 02:27:23.216]  That's why I sit there and I confront all these different groups and organizations on the left and the right.
[02:27:23.216 --> 02:27:24.316]  That's what it's all about.
[02:27:24.316 --> 02:27:29.618]  Now we've got a man that became a political prisoner on the line.
[02:27:30.677 --> 02:27:37.642]  Pete Santilli, you know, I used to think he was a fed because he was so out there and you know this and that, putting out kind of that rhetoric.
[02:27:37.642 --> 02:27:48.991]  Later he found out he was being set up and he covered what happened with the Bundy Ranch and then out in Oregon and so much more and he literally didn't plea bargain and beat their fake case against him and he called us, we respect him,
[02:27:50.031 --> 02:27:50.631]  I don't think so.
[02:28:11.698 --> 02:28:16.660]  I'm just simply saying the left says we're a bunch of violent terrorists that are going to start killing each other.
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:17.801]  Let's not play into their hands.
[02:28:17.801 --> 02:28:23.003]  Because if I was them, and I was a Machiavellian, I would be staging truck bombs and things to blame us.
[02:28:23.003 --> 02:28:26.744]  So I see their next move as a false flag, as I said before the 6th.
[02:28:26.744 --> 02:28:33.207]  And so that's why I'm so concerned and trying to get people to get out of this violent revolution talk, because this is an information war.
[02:28:33.207 --> 02:28:35.188]  Sure, call me old, call me a wimp.
[02:28:35.188 --> 02:28:36.068]  Say I'm sitting it out.
[02:28:38.334 --> 02:28:39.996]  Mike Dunn's probably not a Fed.
[02:28:39.996 --> 02:28:45.460]  He had talking points to try to say I was a Fed, but I don't think he's a Fed.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:50.324]  I just think he's misguided and pissed off and feels like he has a revolutionary duty and caught up with the moment.
[02:28:50.324 --> 02:28:50.724]  Same thing.
[02:28:50.724 --> 02:28:53.307]  Proud Boys, on average, are great, amazing people.
[02:28:53.307 --> 02:28:58.211]  Just because maybe their leader was an informant, well, the Fed's come after your ass.
[02:28:58.211 --> 02:29:02.554]  So let's go ahead and go to Pete Santilli and, of course, Owen Schroeder's riding shotgun here.
[02:29:02.554 --> 02:29:04.376]  He can pop in any time, but go ahead.
[02:29:06.892 --> 02:29:08.634]  Alex, thanks for having me back on.
[02:29:08.634 --> 02:29:17.021]  You know, one thing that I learned through the two federal trials that, by the way, I was directly involved in defeating them for the following reasons.
[02:29:17.021 --> 02:29:26.549]  When we talk about the FBI, I mean, if there's anything we get out of this particular segment before I leave, I want everybody to know, and I think you'll agree with me, that one thing we need is
[02:29:27.842 --> 02:29:31.548]  Reform within the FBI with this FBI informant thing.
[02:29:31.548 --> 02:29:34.954]  Yesterday was the fifth anniversary.
[02:29:34.954 --> 02:29:38.961]  January 26th is the day that an FBI informant
[02:29:39.582 --> 02:29:42.443]  Actually set up an ambush with a convoy.
[02:29:42.443 --> 02:29:51.124]  He was the top, he was the lead security guy and led to the, and yes people do die by the way, I have one of their names.
[02:29:51.124 --> 02:29:52.705]  His name is LaVoy Fennecum.
[02:29:52.705 --> 02:29:57.726]  He was led into that ambush by an FBI informant, a confidential human source.
[02:29:57.726 --> 02:30:03.807]  What I've learned through the Bundy Ranch Trials and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is that
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:09.344]  Mr. Boogaloo Boy mentioned something when I was doing research on Enrique Theriault.
[02:30:09.344 --> 02:30:22.556]  The number one indication that you've got somebody that is either an FBI informant or potentially to be compromised to become an FBI informant or somebody that cooperates is when they start talking about unlawful activity.
[02:30:23.016 --> 02:30:27.037]  At no point in time did the President incite anyone to break the law.
[02:30:27.037 --> 02:30:30.418]  At no point in time did I ever hear Alex Jones say, let's go to D.C.
[02:30:30.418 --> 02:30:31.498]  and let's go break the law.
[02:30:31.498 --> 02:30:33.479]  You didn't even ask for civil disobedience.
[02:30:33.479 --> 02:30:35.279]  You just asked for sheer numbers.
[02:30:35.279 --> 02:30:45.722]  When that Mr. Graham Poobah Boogaloo boy with the USMC hat on says that he breaks the law by open carrying in places where he shouldn't,
[02:30:47.066 --> 02:30:48.708]  We patriots don't break the law.
[02:30:48.708 --> 02:30:49.808]  We're defensive.
[02:30:49.808 --> 02:30:57.855]  I mean, even the Citizens Militia that's lawful, compliant, they work with their sheriff, their legislators, they're not talking about breaking the law.
[02:30:57.855 --> 02:31:04.261]  Now, when this gentleman comes on and talks about breaking the law, he's online doing exactly what the FBI wants.
[02:31:04.261 --> 02:31:07.283]  It's basically a freebie for them to grab him.
[02:31:07.283 --> 02:31:11.227]  He should get an attorney, by the way, based on what I heard in his last presentation, because
[02:31:11.707 --> 02:31:13.248]  They're gonna roll this guy.
[02:31:13.248 --> 02:31:26.037]  If he's the leader of the Boogaloo Boys, he's the perfect candidate to say, look it, you're facing 30 years for seditious conspiracy, but if you cooperate, quote-unquote, we will give you time served.
[02:31:26.037 --> 02:31:30.100]  We just need your testimony, and you come into court, and we'll let you go.
[02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:31.941]  And basically, they get 10 other people.
[02:31:31.941 --> 02:31:34.903]  This happened in two separate trials.
[02:31:34.903 --> 02:31:38.486]  We even had a confidential human source, an FBI informant,
[02:31:39.086 --> 02:31:40.426]  His name was Jared Miller.
[02:31:40.426 --> 02:31:41.987]  He worked with the LVMPD.
[02:31:41.987 --> 02:31:47.748]  He was running around at Bunny Ranch asking, he said, I've got a felony and I'm looking for an AK-47.
[02:31:47.748 --> 02:31:49.449]  I said, what the heck is that?
[02:31:49.449 --> 02:31:50.769]  Get the heck away from us.
[02:31:50.769 --> 02:31:52.509]  Go hand out water.
[02:31:52.509 --> 02:31:53.910]  You can't be near a gun.
[02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:54.910]  That's breaking the law.
[02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:56.110]  And Pete, let's be clear.
[02:31:56.110 --> 02:31:58.931]  You were a guy not calling for violence when recovering at the time.
[02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:00.011]  Never.
[02:32:00.011 --> 02:32:03.234]  And you still were in jail for years and they tried to set you up.
[02:32:03.234 --> 02:32:04.855]  You didn't please and you got out.
[02:32:04.855 --> 02:32:05.876]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:32:05.876 --> 02:32:08.458]  I'm trying to tell people playing soldier is dangerous.
[02:32:08.458 --> 02:32:10.259]  So I shouldn't kid with people.
[02:32:10.259 --> 02:32:11.420]  I shouldn't get on the level.
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.762]  He's calling me a fed and call him a young punk and stuff.
[02:32:13.762 --> 02:32:14.843]  I apologize for that.
[02:32:14.843 --> 02:32:18.526]  I'm on against all the Boogaloo people and I'm sure as hell not not not.
[02:32:18.526 --> 02:32:19.306]  Some people text me.
[02:32:19.306 --> 02:32:20.848]  Hey, are you saying the Proud Boys are feds?
[02:32:20.848 --> 02:32:23.230]  No, it's in Reuters saying that.
[02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:24.671]  And that's why you originally wanted to come on.
[02:32:25.311 --> 02:32:27.473]  We'll do the next segment, but get into this now.
[02:32:27.473 --> 02:32:31.237]  You've seen this before where they come and tell pro and say somebody's a fed when they're not.
[02:32:31.237 --> 02:32:32.899]  Explain that.
[02:32:32.899 --> 02:32:33.339]  That's right.
[02:32:33.339 --> 02:32:34.581]  I'll use an example.
[02:32:34.581 --> 02:32:35.822]  There was a man at Bundy Ranch.
[02:32:35.822 --> 02:32:37.884]  He was in charge of security for Clive and Bundy.
[02:32:37.884 --> 02:32:40.827]  He said he was a former gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps.
[02:32:40.827 --> 02:32:44.811]  He's running around with guns and teams and he was, you know, talking the talk.
[02:32:45.533 --> 02:32:48.094]  Uh, he was on YouTube obviously doing a lot of research.
[02:32:48.094 --> 02:32:50.775]  That guy had never spent one moment in the Marine Corps.
[02:32:50.775 --> 02:32:53.416]  He was a felon running around with firearms.
[02:32:53.416 --> 02:33:00.918]  Well, when they rounded everybody up, guess who you think, who do you think was the first FBI informant that rolled and the person that cooperated?
[02:33:01.358 --> 02:33:06.562]  The man that was facing 30 years in prison, plus, just for being a felon with a firearm.
[02:33:06.562 --> 02:33:23.275]  So, when you speak out, even if this kid that was on before, the Boogaloo Boy, and I'm not disparaging the Boogaloo Boys, I'm informing the Boogaloo Boys, the number one indicator that you've got a compromising situation is when somebody suggests breaking the law, because we're not lawbreakers.
[02:33:24.116 --> 02:33:28.724]  At Bundy Ranch we have... Plus, anybody breaking the law, they never say we're breaking the law.
[02:33:28.724 --> 02:33:30.266]  They say, hey, we're doing this.
[02:33:30.266 --> 02:33:34.814]  I mean, it doesn't matter where you're at, the military, or the mafia, or any corporate job.
[02:33:34.814 --> 02:33:37.459]  When people are breaking the law, you don't go, hey, let's break the law!
[02:33:39.011 --> 02:33:53.940]  No, and Alex, here's a list of all the confidential human sources, all of the FBI informants, and we joke about it at Malheur, we say that 8 people took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 15 of them were FBI informants.
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.802]  They actually acquitted everybody because the people that broke the law
[02:33:57.182 --> 02:33:58.464]  We're the FBI informants.
[02:33:58.464 --> 02:34:00.926]  A Portland jury acquitted the jury.
[02:34:00.926 --> 02:34:05.431]  The FBI informant program needs reform because this is what they do.
[02:34:05.431 --> 02:34:15.141]  They get people that are on drugs, they give them envelopes of cash, and this literally happened even with one of our own estranged family members that was on heroin.
[02:34:15.141 --> 02:34:17.123]  They pulled them in, gave them $4,000 in an envelope,
[02:34:19.629 --> 02:34:22.874]  Uh, she was hooked on heroin and they had her wired up.
[02:34:22.874 --> 02:34:27.239]  Fortunately, nothing was said on that wire because we're not lawbreakers.
[02:34:27.239 --> 02:34:35.130]  But what they will do is they will also take somebody, I'm going to have to say this, I like Enrique Terrio and I'm not, I'm not saying that he's a bad guy.
[02:34:35.737 --> 02:34:41.280]  But they arrested him and he faces possible criminal sentencing.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:46.264]  They're going to use somebody like that to say, all right, listen, you're the leader of the Proud Boys.
[02:34:46.264 --> 02:34:51.026]  If you roll on a couple of guys like Joe Biggs, we'll give you a lesser sentence.
[02:34:51.026 --> 02:34:52.247]  We need your testimony.
[02:34:52.247 --> 02:34:59.252]  And they will go out and pursue five to ten people and take them down with Enrique Terrio's testimony.
[02:34:59.252 --> 02:35:01.933]  My main concern is he's already done it before.
[02:35:01.933 --> 02:35:02.974]  I've already checked the record.
[02:35:03.574 --> 02:35:09.681]  He had already been a cooperator in 2012, and Rick Atario was.
[02:35:09.681 --> 02:35:18.950]  And that's my only point, is anybody involved, whether it's Proud Boys or Boogaloo, any paramilitary deal, is going to have feds like flies on piles of you-know-what.
[02:35:19.210 --> 02:35:19.510]  Oh.
[02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:25.274]  And so, and the Feds are always leading it, going, oh no, anyone that says look out for Feds, they're the enemy.
[02:35:25.274 --> 02:35:26.775]  They're CIA.
[02:35:26.775 --> 02:35:27.876]  Don't listen to Jones.
[02:35:27.876 --> 02:35:29.777]  He's warning you to not get set up.
[02:35:29.777 --> 02:35:30.818]  He's CIA.
[02:35:30.818 --> 02:35:31.018]  No.
[02:35:31.018 --> 02:35:33.600]  If I was CIA, I'd be like, yeah, Trump's gonna win.
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:35.221]  Get in there and get him.
[02:35:35.221 --> 02:35:37.162]  All right, I want to come back and get Owen Troyer's take on this.
[02:35:37.162 --> 02:35:40.704]  We'll host a few segments of Leo Zegami coming up on the fall of the Italian government.
[02:35:40.704 --> 02:35:45.087]  I didn't mean to get off into all this today, but it's very important so folks don't get set up.
[02:35:45.087 --> 02:35:46.008]  InfoWars.com.
[02:35:47.602 --> 02:35:50.083]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[02:35:50.083 --> 02:35:53.165]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[02:35:53.165 --> 02:35:58.787]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:35:58.787 --> 02:36:01.028]  The subsection is prepared with Alex.com.
[02:36:01.028 --> 02:36:04.490]  And it's all these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[02:36:05.290 --> 02:36:08.233]  You need to understand that you need 25-year food supply.
[02:36:08.233 --> 02:36:13.358]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're gonna find.
[02:36:13.358 --> 02:36:23.487]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[02:36:24.068 --> 02:36:27.392]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:27.392 --> 02:36:29.454]  You can find the preparedness section there.
[02:36:29.454 --> 02:36:31.597]  Water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[02:36:31.597 --> 02:36:34.701]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[02:36:34.701 --> 02:36:35.982]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[02:36:35.982 --> 02:36:37.304]  It starts with self-defense.
[02:36:37.304 --> 02:36:38.645]  It starts with being prepared.
[02:36:38.645 --> 02:36:39.607]  It starts with storable food.
[02:36:39.607 --> 02:36:40.848]  It starts with digging in.
[02:36:40.848 --> 02:36:43.031]  With a long, globalist fight you'll win in the end.
[02:36:46.195 --> 02:36:50.296]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[02:36:50.296 --> 02:36:52.656]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[02:36:52.656 --> 02:37:00.297]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[02:37:00.297 --> 02:37:04.198]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[02:37:04.198 --> 02:37:07.659]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[02:37:07.659 --> 02:37:10.099]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[02:37:10.099 --> 02:37:12.480]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:14.300]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:20.704]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[02:37:20.704 --> 02:37:22.245]  Okay?
[02:37:22.245 --> 02:37:26.848]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[02:37:26.848 --> 02:37:29.130]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[02:37:29.130 --> 02:37:29.951]  These are real numbers.
[02:37:29.951 --> 02:37:31.232]  These are real facts.
[02:37:31.232 --> 02:37:38.617]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[02:37:39.098 --> 02:37:39.880]  Rebuke it.
[02:37:39.880 --> 02:37:41.063]  Stand up against it.
[02:37:41.063 --> 02:37:42.828]  This is slavery.
[02:37:42.828 --> 02:37:45.054]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[02:37:47.128 --> 02:37:48.769]  Three, two, one.
[02:37:48.769 --> 02:37:49.769]  Here we go!
[02:37:49.769 --> 02:37:50.469]  It's back in stock.
[02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:51.949]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[02:37:51.949 --> 02:37:55.070]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:56.371]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[02:37:56.371 --> 02:38:00.472]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[02:38:00.472 --> 02:38:06.454]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[02:38:06.454 --> 02:38:07.594]  It's amazing.
[02:38:07.594 --> 02:38:09.075]  Folks absolutely love it.
[02:38:09.075 --> 02:38:12.016]  And again, France has been shut down, so we couldn't get it.
[02:38:12.016 --> 02:38:13.776]  Now, a limited supply is back in stock.
[02:38:13.776 --> 02:38:14.836]  25% off at infomorestore.com.
[02:38:16.857 --> 02:38:20.580]  Pollen Block, again, is available in this one-minute ad.
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:31.647]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[02:38:31.647 --> 02:38:33.248]  This is naturally occurring.
[02:38:33.248 --> 02:38:40.073]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress, and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[02:38:40.073 --> 02:38:40.993]  You chew up the pills.
[02:38:40.993 --> 02:38:41.854]  They taste great.
[02:38:41.854 --> 02:38:42.954]  It's available again.
[02:38:42.954 --> 02:38:44.515]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:38:44.515 --> 02:38:45.236]  Pollen Block.
[02:38:45.236 --> 02:38:46.557]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:38:47.698 --> 02:38:48.899]  I've got some bad news.
[02:38:48.899 --> 02:38:57.169]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[02:38:57.169 --> 02:38:58.651]  But here's the good news.
[02:38:58.651 --> 02:39:06.900]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[02:39:07.621 --> 02:39:13.285]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:39:13.285 --> 02:39:13.986]  People love it.
[02:39:13.986 --> 02:39:15.307]  That's selling out.
[02:39:15.307 --> 02:39:18.649]  Despite that, it's still discounted at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:22.712]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:39:22.712 --> 02:39:24.973]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:39:24.973 --> 02:39:25.794]  People really love it.
[02:39:25.794 --> 02:39:27.555]  It's extremely strong as well.
[02:39:27.555 --> 02:39:28.696]  It's selling out.
[02:39:28.696 --> 02:39:31.738]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[02:39:31.738 --> 02:39:35.661]  It also funds the InfoWar and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[02:39:36.081 --> 02:39:37.882]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:39:37.882 --> 02:39:45.666]  Please visit Infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the InfoWar.

[02:39:50.028 --> 02:39:52.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:07.276 --> 02:40:14.878]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes.
[02:40:14.878 --> 02:40:18.940]  And the chauffeur drives your car.
[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:21.981]  You let everybody know.
[02:40:23.141 --> 02:40:37.517]  You know, I think Owen's been right since the first hour, trying to guide me back to not fight with the Boogaloos and not fight with the Proud Boys, which I'm not fighting with any of those groups.
[02:40:37.517 --> 02:40:38.398]  I love the Proud Boys.
[02:40:38.398 --> 02:40:40.400]  I agree with a lot of stuff the Boogaloos say.
[02:40:41.508 --> 02:40:45.429]  I just see a fertile ground for the Feds to set us up.
[02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:46.069]  And you know what?
[02:40:46.069 --> 02:40:46.369]  Fine.
[02:40:46.369 --> 02:40:47.269]  Everybody wants a revolution.
[02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:48.690]  Do whatever you're going to do.
[02:40:48.690 --> 02:40:50.810]  It was all a joke about Mike Dunne and the boxing match.
[02:40:50.810 --> 02:40:53.771]  I saw that stuff with... What's his name?
[02:40:53.771 --> 02:40:57.072]  I've been on the show.
[02:40:57.072 --> 02:40:57.532]  What's it called?
[02:40:57.532 --> 02:40:58.792]  Logan Paul.
[02:40:58.792 --> 02:41:00.393]  Logan Paul and the other Paul guy.
[02:41:00.393 --> 02:41:01.553]  Can you go back to the show?
[02:41:01.553 --> 02:41:02.253]  Yeah, forget the other guy's name.
[02:41:02.253 --> 02:41:05.154]  That's like the biggest news in the country because they do the little boxing matches.
[02:41:05.154 --> 02:41:05.654]  It was a joke.
[02:41:06.283 --> 02:41:08.244]  Okay.
[02:41:08.244 --> 02:41:12.245]  All I know is I'm not working for the CIA, and I don't think the Dunn guy is working for the FBI.
[02:41:12.245 --> 02:41:17.807]  I kind of thought that before, until I actually got the guy on, which even freaks me out more.
[02:41:17.807 --> 02:41:26.870]  And we've got the forced inoculations, the world government, the Davos group, Biden saying you can't say China virus, signing executive orders, you got to wear two or three masks.
[02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:28.711]  We should have covered all that today.
[02:41:28.711 --> 02:41:31.752]  It's still been a good radio show, but ratings is not what I'm looking for.
[02:41:31.752 --> 02:41:33.773]  That Mike Dunn interview was huge.
[02:41:33.773 --> 02:41:34.673]  It's going to go viral.
[02:41:36.188 --> 02:41:39.189]  I appreciate him coming on.
[02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:40.010]  I get his point.
[02:41:40.010 --> 02:41:40.870]  Declaration of Independence.
[02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:42.271]  Do whatever you want.
[02:41:42.271 --> 02:41:43.051]  Fine.
[02:41:43.051 --> 02:41:43.851]  I get it.
[02:41:43.851 --> 02:41:50.154]  I'm just saying, I was there trying to... Here's why I'm mad at everybody who broke into the Capitol.
[02:41:50.154 --> 02:41:52.015]  Even though they were between the velvet ropes and all of it.
[02:41:53.061 --> 02:41:53.962]  I worked with Trump.
[02:41:53.962 --> 02:41:59.465]  We wanted a peaceful rally to show that we have millions and they have nobody and that Biden can't fill a parking lot.
[02:41:59.465 --> 02:42:03.407]  And we thought that's what people would do, and a small minority took it over.
[02:42:03.407 --> 02:42:05.969]  But okay, I've taken protest over, so I get it.
[02:42:05.969 --> 02:42:12.813]  So I'm just pissed because my mission and my operation got screwed, and I see it as a defeat.
[02:42:12.813 --> 02:42:14.254]  Other people see it as a victory.
[02:42:14.254 --> 02:42:15.315]  I don't see it as a victory.
[02:42:15.315 --> 02:42:19.237]  I want to go back to Owen Schwerer for some comments, then we'll get Pete Santelli's take.
[02:42:19.237 --> 02:42:20.898]  Well, I think in general, Alex, there were just...
[02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:23.110]  I don't know.
[02:42:38.516 --> 02:42:45.420]  It's like, wow, look at all these millions of people here, and we didn't even know at the time, because like you said, I mean, we were having a debate right there.
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.562]  I mean, that's the thing, look, trust me folks, there's no controlled opposition here.
[02:42:48.562 --> 02:42:49.902]  We're flying from the seat of our pants.
[02:42:49.902 --> 02:42:53.484]  We had a debate, Alex, you and me, the crew, we debated right there on the streets.
[02:42:53.484 --> 02:42:54.305]  When should we march?
[02:42:54.305 --> 02:42:55.025]  How should we march?
[02:42:55.025 --> 02:42:56.246]  What should our message be?
[02:42:56.246 --> 02:42:57.246]  Okay, peaceful march.
[02:42:57.246 --> 02:42:57.967]  Alright, when should we do it?
[02:42:57.967 --> 02:43:01.769]  We're having debates during the break about, hey, Boogaloo's are probably good, leave them alone.
[02:43:01.769 --> 02:43:03.110]  Or, you know, don't be mean to the Proud Boys.
[02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:04.691]  I'm not even being mean to the Proud Boys.
[02:43:04.691 --> 02:43:06.452]  It's in the news, they're saying he's a federal informant.
[02:43:06.452 --> 02:43:07.152]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:43:07.472 --> 02:43:14.493]  And so my point is that we didn't realize there were going to be 100,000 people at the Capitol before we were even leaving the Trump speech.
[02:43:14.493 --> 02:43:21.075]  We didn't realize people were going to be charged up and wanting to breach the Capitol while we were sitting there listening to Trump speak.
[02:43:21.075 --> 02:43:26.476]  Had we that foresight, which maybe that's our regret that we didn't, had we that foresight, we would have been more clear.
[02:43:26.476 --> 02:43:28.296]  Hey, make sure no one breaches the ground.
[02:43:28.296 --> 02:43:29.577]  Make sure they have their hearing.
[02:43:29.577 --> 02:43:33.037]  Make sure Trump gets there so we can have a peaceful rally.
[02:43:33.037 --> 02:43:33.758]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:33.758 --> 02:43:35.718]  But let me just say this before we go back to Pete Santilli.
[02:43:36.198 --> 02:43:36.799]  Let's expand on this.
[02:43:36.799 --> 02:43:41.644]  If people went into Microsoft, that is a eugenics globalist organization, pushing world government, pushing forced inoculations, that are killing people,
[02:43:55.347 --> 02:43:57.069]  I would say, okay, it's a revolution.
[02:43:57.069 --> 02:44:05.439]  And I'm not saying do that, but if people raided the CFR in New York, if people raided the Davos Group, if people, I would say, whoa, they're attacking the real enemy.
[02:44:05.439 --> 02:44:11.287]  The People's House and the Congress, when we're about to win, I'm just saying that's not the right target.
[02:44:11.287 --> 02:44:13.509]  That's all I'm saying is it was an idiotic target.
[02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:16.191]  And that's why I get pissed off.
[02:44:16.191 --> 02:44:28.756]  Well, that's what happens when you don't have, and again, I've never been a violent revolutionary, never will be, but that's what happens when you think you're going to have a violent revolution or you think you're going to spark a violent revolution or maybe you have that in the back of your mind and you don't actually... Let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:44:28.756 --> 02:44:34.879]  The Q thing created this, the main group that went in behind the Antifa was Q people.
[02:44:34.879 --> 02:44:39.460]  Not against the average Q person, but they believed this was, oh Q, we're winning!
[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:40.201]  This was the real...
[02:44:41.161 --> 02:44:47.807]  If you want to make the comparison to 1776, which I'm in agreement with you, that's about the ideology, not about the physical violence.
[02:44:47.807 --> 02:44:48.608]  They didn't just show up.
[02:44:48.608 --> 02:44:50.490]  I mean, they planned the Boston Tea Party.
[02:44:50.490 --> 02:44:53.433]  They planned hiding in the woods when the Redcoats marched through.
[02:44:53.433 --> 02:44:55.454]  They specifically attacked the ships.
[02:44:56.445 --> 02:44:58.526]  That we're paying the tax and made them pay.
[02:44:58.526 --> 02:45:00.867]  That was a very precise attack.
[02:45:00.867 --> 02:45:04.228]  And I'll just say this as far as Enrique is concerned.
[02:45:04.228 --> 02:45:07.189]  You know, I consider Enrique a pretty close friend.
[02:45:07.189 --> 02:45:11.651]  I know some things about his past and I would be shocked.
[02:45:11.651 --> 02:45:19.394]  I would be shocked and stunned if Enrique would capitulate to the FBI or become some sort of informer against his boys.
[02:45:19.394 --> 02:45:21.054]  I don't want to say too much private stuff.
[02:45:21.054 --> 02:45:22.755]  I mean, maybe he'll go on record, but I'll tell you.
[02:45:22.755 --> 02:45:25.516]  Well, what they're saying is years ago he was an informant.
[02:45:26.377 --> 02:45:34.342]  When he was selling like medical supplies for testing for diabetes, and I know that works if you don't, you're not an official company, you're not allowed to resell.
[02:45:34.342 --> 02:45:37.344]  I looked up his stuff, he went to jail for that, so like that's nothing.
[02:45:37.344 --> 02:45:40.266]  And so it's like, oh, past stuff like five, ten years ago.
[02:45:40.266 --> 02:45:43.928]  And we've got, who knows if it's true, because you're right, the FBI could put anything in those reports.
[02:45:43.928 --> 02:45:53.835]  And I'll just say this, again, I don't want to say too much, he'll make his own statements, but I'll just say back then, they did try to cut deals with him to get him less jail time, and he didn't take them, he passed them, he did his full sentence, so.
[02:45:55.418 --> 02:45:56.159]  That's right.
[02:45:56.159 --> 02:45:57.662]  So we don't believe anything the mainstream media says.
[02:45:57.662 --> 02:46:08.742]  Going back to Pete Santilli, who was a political prisoner back in the Bundy Ranch days, what other comments do you want to relay to people about the season we're going into of false flags, of violence, of insanity?
[02:46:10.472 --> 02:46:19.595]  Listen, of course, rank-and-file, FBI, law enforcement, they're probably not involved in non-compromise, but at the upper echelon, and I have first-hand experience.
[02:46:19.595 --> 02:46:22.616]  Bundy Ranch was not a spontaneous event in April of 2014.
[02:46:22.616 --> 02:46:28.919]  They started creating the emotional pretext for an indictment in January of 2014.
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:33.041]  Now, do you remember Larry Grathwald?
[02:46:33.041 --> 02:46:34.882]  Larry Grathwald was an FBI informant.
[02:46:34.882 --> 02:46:36.984]  He was not an agent way back in the day.
[02:46:36.984 --> 02:46:39.606]  He infiltrated the weather underground.
[02:46:39.606 --> 02:46:45.850]  I think all of us here, and hopefully all of your listenership are law-abiding citizens, we want to go get the bad guys.
[02:46:45.850 --> 02:46:47.712]  Larry Grathwald was the perfect
[02:46:48.437 --> 02:46:51.378]  Uh, FBI informant, because he pursued the bad guys.
[02:46:51.378 --> 02:47:00.902]  If Enrique Terrio shared information about lawbreakers, I don't know the Proud Boys, I don't know any Proud Boys that want to break the law, uh, nor does Enrique Terrio, I'm sure.
[02:47:00.902 --> 02:47:01.882]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:47:01.882 --> 02:47:04.083]  Now the Weathermen are in control of the government.
[02:47:04.083 --> 02:47:10.105]  Grathwald, the Green Beret of Patriot, they recruited him at Columbia, and he went in and it was like horrible.
[02:47:10.105 --> 02:47:11.686]  He did the right thing and went to the FBI.
[02:47:11.686 --> 02:47:12.166]  That's good.
[02:47:13.241 --> 02:47:14.602]  Exactly right.
[02:47:14.602 --> 02:47:24.647]  Now, there's a lot of pressure on people and that's where I say you make the perfect FBI informant when they force 30 years upon you and say, well, if you'll cooperate.
[02:47:24.647 --> 02:47:31.291]  Well, if you're of the integrity, I'm glad, and I didn't know this, I'm glad that Owen mentioned it, that he did not capitulate.
[02:47:31.291 --> 02:47:33.712]  I was asked, would you like to cooperate?
[02:47:33.712 --> 02:47:33.952]  I said,
[02:47:34.532 --> 02:47:35.873]  I have nothing to cooperate about.
[02:47:35.873 --> 02:47:40.275]  I saw nobody breaking the law and I told the prosecutors to pound sand.
[02:47:40.275 --> 02:47:45.317]  And that is a person of integrity is going to stand on the truth, of course.
[02:47:45.317 --> 02:47:52.541]  Now, there are individuals that will succumb to the pressure, unfortunately, and we have to vet the people that are around us.
[02:47:52.541 --> 02:47:56.583]  But like I said, the number one indication that you're around somebody that is either
[02:47:57.223 --> 02:48:04.464]  An informant that is setting you up for entrapment because that's what they did through Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
[02:48:04.464 --> 02:48:06.345]  You will be entrapped by these people.
[02:48:06.345 --> 02:48:17.007]  The FBI uses those less than scrupulous people that are, you know, drug addicts or previous felons and so on and so forth.
[02:48:17.007 --> 02:48:19.147]  They'll use them to entrap you.
[02:48:19.147 --> 02:48:20.687]  So we have to be very, very careful.
[02:48:20.687 --> 02:48:21.627]  We're sitting on a powder keg.
[02:48:21.627 --> 02:48:21.927]  Absolutely.
[02:48:21.927 --> 02:48:23.908]  Alright, Pete Santilli, I appreciate your time.
[02:48:23.908 --> 02:48:24.828]  How do people find your show?
[02:48:26.175 --> 02:48:29.157]  All of our links are at PeteSantilli.mobi.
[02:48:29.157 --> 02:48:32.280]  We're all over the place, well diversified, so that people can find us.
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:39.045]  We're being chased around the internet just like everyone else is, being demonetized and deleted, but PeteSantilli.mobi.
[02:48:39.045 --> 02:48:40.266]  Alright, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:48:40.266 --> 02:48:40.967]  We're out of time.
[02:48:40.967 --> 02:48:41.828]  Thank you, brother.
[02:48:41.828 --> 02:48:44.410]  And again, I didn't want to spend... Thank you, sir.
[02:48:44.410 --> 02:48:53.077]  I didn't want to spend two hours of the show, which we basically just did, on this, but I was there, I witnessed it, and I witnessed people being led into idiocy.
[02:48:53.977 --> 02:48:57.040]  And I just do not want to see this happen anymore.
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.622]  I want to politically challenge Joe Biden.
[02:48:59.622 --> 02:49:02.645]  Joe Biden's going to fail if we just politically challenge him.
[02:49:02.645 --> 02:49:08.830]  If we just have the states organize a new Declaration of Independence, if we just say you're a fraud, if we're peaceful, we're going to beat him.
[02:49:08.830 --> 02:49:09.690]  We have the people.
[02:49:09.690 --> 02:49:11.072]  Trump won the landslide.
[02:49:11.072 --> 02:49:13.193]  They want to trick us into a violent revolution.
[02:49:13.193 --> 02:49:15.035]  If you think I'm wrong, don't listen, folks.
[02:49:15.035 --> 02:49:16.356]  That's fine.
[02:49:16.356 --> 02:49:18.018]  I don't think violent revolution is the answer.
[02:49:18.018 --> 02:49:18.298]  And listen,
[02:49:19.701 --> 02:49:22.022]  You know, you heard the Boogaloo guy, oh, you're bad, you sell things.
[02:49:22.022 --> 02:49:26.124]  Well, yeah, I've got a network, satellite up, Lynx TV, huge crew that's all paid well.
[02:49:26.124 --> 02:49:27.225]  We're trying to stay on air.
[02:49:27.225 --> 02:49:29.626]  Please go to infowarestore.com today.
[02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:31.747]  We have the Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[02:49:31.747 --> 02:49:36.429]  It's so good for your immune system, so good for inflammation, so good for everything.
[02:49:36.429 --> 02:49:37.289]  It's about to sell out.
[02:49:37.289 --> 02:49:40.671]  Despite that, it's still discounted.
[02:49:40.671 --> 02:49:46.574]  And X2, the Deep Earth Crystal, pure iodine, essential to your body, the building block of everything.
[02:49:48.117 --> 02:49:55.621]  That sale of 50% off will end in about three days, because we're very close to selling out of X2 and InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:49:55.621 --> 02:49:57.342]  And without you, we're not here.
[02:49:57.342 --> 02:49:59.303]  You know me, I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[02:49:59.303 --> 02:50:00.964]  I'm trying to beat the Globalist.
[02:50:00.964 --> 02:50:06.547]  And so my job is to do what's unpopular and tell the truth up front and not play games with this garbage.
[02:50:06.547 --> 02:50:07.448]  And that's my commitment.
[02:50:07.448 --> 02:50:08.408]  I'm not thinking about myself.
[02:50:08.408 --> 02:50:13.111]  I'm thinking about what happens to me at the end of the day, though I ask you to pray for us and keep us in the fight.
[02:50:13.111 --> 02:50:15.232]  So Owen Troyer, I know he pushes Agami off.
[02:50:15.232 --> 02:50:15.852]  I want to hear from him.
[02:50:15.852 --> 02:50:16.713]  I don't know if he's coming up.
[02:50:17.153 --> 02:50:20.454]  And then we've got John Rappaport loaded for bear.
[02:50:20.454 --> 02:50:21.214]  You take over.
[02:50:21.214 --> 02:50:22.835]  Hopefully Zoghami's coming on for a few segments.
[02:50:22.835 --> 02:50:23.995]  If not, I don't know.
[02:50:23.995 --> 02:50:28.036]  And then we've got John Rappaport coming on in the War Room that Owen will be hosting.
[02:50:28.036 --> 02:50:30.277]  I'm sure he's wound up listening to me for hours.
[02:50:30.277 --> 02:50:30.697]  3 p.m.
[02:50:30.697 --> 02:50:31.517]  Central today.

[02:51:36.656 --> 02:51:50.651]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[02:51:50.651 --> 02:51:52.673]  It's all now completely official.
[02:51:52.673 --> 02:51:57.478]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab
[02:51:58.038 --> 02:52:03.684]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[02:52:03.684 --> 02:52:04.665]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[02:52:04.665 --> 02:52:05.366]  It's here.
[02:52:05.366 --> 02:52:10.752]  And it only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[02:52:12.532 --> 02:52:18.878]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[02:52:18.878 --> 02:52:21.061]  We must start valuing human life again.
[02:52:21.061 --> 02:52:27.967]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[02:52:27.967 --> 02:52:30.710]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:34.114]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[02:52:40.066 --> 02:52:49.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:52:49.611 --> 02:52:52.172]  We're back here in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:52:52.172 --> 02:52:57.455]  Owen Schroer and Leo Zagami with you for about the next 20 minutes.
[02:52:57.455 --> 02:52:59.636]  I'm seeing all kinds of headlines.
[02:52:59.636 --> 02:53:03.378]  Out of Italy, the government collapsing.
[02:53:03.378 --> 02:53:05.299]  Government officials stepping down.
[02:53:05.299 --> 02:53:06.580]  There seems to be some sort of a...
[02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:12.843]  Maybe not the best phrase, but like a cold civil war, a war of words for sure happening.
[02:53:12.843 --> 02:53:16.005]  And so I always think of Leo Zagami from Italy.
[02:53:16.005 --> 02:53:18.966]  Did a lot of great work exposing the Vatican, his great books.
[02:53:18.966 --> 02:53:21.388]  We sell them at infowarestore.com.
[02:53:21.388 --> 02:53:24.750]  And of course the greatest Italian-American accent in radio.
[02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:27.431]  So Leo Zagami joins me now.
[02:53:27.431 --> 02:53:31.313]  Leo, what is going on in Italy right now?
[02:53:31.313 --> 02:53:32.394]  Explain this to the audience.
[02:53:33.547 --> 02:53:37.689]  Well, it's very hard to explain something that even the Italians seem to have problems in explaining.
[02:53:37.689 --> 02:53:55.717]  I mean, I just saw the latest news and they're giving like five different kind of solutions to the problem, which is basically a crisis that was created by a friend of Joe Biden, Matteo Renzi, who with the arrival of Joe Biden in the White House,
[02:53:56.517 --> 02:54:12.887]  He obviously tried to create a crisis so he can get back in government in a leading position because his group, his political party, which only counts 3% of the national votes, is actually a non-existing party almost.
[02:54:12.887 --> 02:54:17.789]  But he's very influential because he's linked to both Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
[02:54:17.789 --> 02:54:20.251]  So Mattiorenzi has instigated this crisis.
[02:54:21.031 --> 02:54:33.724]  Giuseppe Conte was eventually forced to resign because he doesn't have the numbers anymore to conduct his government without this faction, this 3% faction led by Matteo Renzi.
[02:54:33.724 --> 02:54:39.290]  So we are in a crisis that of course has only a solution.
[02:54:40.591 --> 02:55:00.868]  A new government, but we don't know if now in the last couple of hours is going to be a new government with Giuseppe Conte because they want to get him out of the way after he received the famous endorsement by Donald J. Trump, President Donald Trump, who endorsed Giuseppe Conte.
[02:55:00.868 --> 02:55:04.651]  And this is a war that, of course, of words, like you said.
[02:55:05.111 --> 02:55:11.373]  But there is a growing tension in Italy because people are pretty desperate.
[02:55:11.373 --> 02:55:13.274]  The lockdowns are never ending.
[02:55:13.274 --> 02:55:19.376]  And so this political charade is not really appreciated by anybody.
[02:55:19.376 --> 02:55:30.200]  And the fear that all these parties have is to actually go to the elections, because with the elections, the center right will definitely win with a large majority.
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:31.160]  I think?
[02:55:46.685 --> 02:55:56.168]  Actually, a mess, this financial creature created by the European Union for the states that are victims of the pandemic.
[02:55:56.168 --> 02:56:03.690]  And that means billions of euros that are poured into the Italian finances.
[02:56:03.690 --> 02:56:13.933]  And of course, there must be a government which is close to Brussels to be able to send forward this project.
[02:56:14.193 --> 02:56:26.557]  So it's all about really the money that the European Union is sending to Italy and about not going back to the elections because they know that they're going to fail.
[02:56:26.557 --> 02:56:37.160]  People are really upset with the latest government, but they were also very much upset with the fact that they voted
[02:56:38.149 --> 02:57:07.111]  For a center-right coalition to be in charge and then last year suddenly there was Matteo Salvini that was sent away and then they substituted his political party with the party that actually was the opposition, the Democrat Party in Italy, which is of course conducted behind the scenes by people who are very close to both Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.
[02:57:07.111 --> 02:57:07.812]  Nancy Pelosi who
[02:57:08.432 --> 02:57:10.354]  Regularly goes to Italy.
[02:57:10.354 --> 02:57:16.340]  She's Italo-American and she is, of course, also very close to the Italian mob.
[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:24.128]  And it seems like, in the end, the guy who is in charge of it all is the Italian president, who I really dislike.
[02:57:24.128 --> 02:57:25.449]  He's Sicilian.
[02:57:25.449 --> 02:57:27.050]  I'm half Sicilian myself.
[02:57:27.050 --> 02:57:29.513]  But he is actually the son of a mobster.
[02:57:30.013 --> 02:57:36.058]  President Trump wanted a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[02:57:52.458 --> 02:58:02.370]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United States that had spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:03.091]  They were desperate.
[02:58:03.091 --> 02:58:04.592]  They admitted their own publications.
[02:58:04.592 --> 02:58:06.815]  They didn't know what to do.
[02:58:06.815 --> 02:58:09.799]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law.
[02:58:11.152 --> 02:58:13.293]  And stole it better than Dallas.
[02:58:13.293 --> 02:58:17.135]  And now they're coming after the President, they're coming after you, they're coming after me.
[02:58:17.135 --> 02:58:21.176]  They're shutting everybody off the Internet, they're trying to totally censor us.
[02:58:21.176 --> 02:58:25.258]  And that's why InfoWars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[02:58:25.258 --> 02:58:31.881]  We told you this was coming, we were the first main target, and we're still on air at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and BandOnVideo.

[02:58:54.602 --> 02:59:01.648]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:01.648 --> 02:59:04.790]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:59:11.125 --> 02:59:13.407]  After this segment.
[02:59:13.407 --> 02:59:17.531]  You know, Leo Zegami with us here, leozegami.com.
[02:59:17.531 --> 02:59:33.384]  I think that the general notion here is, and you're trying to get into some of the details, but it's very confusing, I think, for the whole world watching what's happening right now, including maybe for some people what they're seeing in America is probably confusing, unless you really understand all the details.
[02:59:33.384 --> 02:59:38.508]  But, as a general statement, or a general kind of analysis here,
[02:59:39.329 --> 02:59:53.237]  You know, this is just another country like the United States or Brazil, Italy, Poland that's having nationalistic populist uprisings against what they now see as a threat to their nation-state sovereignty.
[02:59:53.237 --> 03:00:02.003]  So whether that's the UN, whether that's the EU, whether that's the medical tyranny that we're seeing now with the fake pandemic COVID that's gone worldwide,
[03:00:02.643 --> 03:00:05.944]  Uh, you know, that's what they're trying to stop from happening.
[03:00:05.944 --> 03:00:07.705]  And so they demonize the people like Trump.
[03:00:07.705 --> 03:00:10.006]  They demonize the people like Conte.
[03:00:10.006 --> 03:00:17.349]  Uh, and so that's the problem here is that you have the nationalistic uprising of people who are now aware of the new world order.
[03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:18.430]  They don't want the UN.
[03:00:18.430 --> 03:00:19.490]  They don't want the EU.
[03:00:19.490 --> 03:00:20.671]  They vote themselves out of it.
[03:00:21.397 --> 03:00:22.899]  Kind of like at Brexit.
[03:00:22.899 --> 03:00:25.521]  And then the establishment just says, no, you don't get that.
[03:00:25.521 --> 03:00:26.602]  You don't get to have Brexit.
[03:00:26.602 --> 03:00:27.964]  You don't get to have Trump.
[03:00:27.964 --> 03:00:31.828]  You don't get to have a resurgence of nationalism in Italy.
[03:00:31.828 --> 03:00:35.071]  And so it's just this, it's just kind of this push and this tug.
[03:00:35.071 --> 03:00:39.535]  You know, the old saying, an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.
[03:00:39.535 --> 03:00:41.477]  I mean, you know, that's the battle that we're seeing here.
[03:00:42.802 --> 03:00:47.686]  What are the Italian people saying and thinking about this, I guess, aside from the confusion?
[03:00:47.686 --> 03:00:52.550]  I mean, because there is no doubt, I mean, Trump is massively popular, the most popular U.S.
[03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:54.372]  president in modern day history.
[03:00:54.372 --> 03:00:57.394]  I think he got 75 million votes minimum.
[03:00:57.394 --> 03:01:03.399]  I mean, I'd even make the argument more than that with what we've seen with some of the machines flipping votes to Biden.
[03:01:03.399 --> 03:01:06.982]  I think Trump maybe got 80 million plus votes, but we know at least 75 plus million.
[03:01:08.303 --> 03:01:18.310]  What are the people in Italy saying about this, you know, the nationalistic, populistic uprising which is just common sense, nation-state sovereignty versus a global agenda?
[03:01:18.310 --> 03:01:22.894]  What are the people saying outside of the words that's happening inside the collapsing government?
[03:01:23.922 --> 03:01:32.806]  Well, they are upset because you see Giuseppe Conte arrived into power thanks to the Five Star Movement, which was perceived as populist.
[03:01:32.806 --> 03:01:44.012]  But after they kicked out Matteo Salvini, and then at that point they placed this insane coalition with the Democratic Party, which was center-left.
[03:01:44.872 --> 03:01:54.536]  The people are really disappointed with the Five Star Movement and they of course see as a last beacon of hope the league of Matteo Salvini.
[03:01:54.536 --> 03:02:10.502]  But they are very worried because they want to place as a new Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who worked for Goldman Sachs, who was the head of the European Central Bank and who is the choice of the Illuminati, the Academy of the Illuminati in Rome.
[03:02:11.262 --> 03:02:16.404]  He has always pushed for Mario Draghi as Prime Minister.
[03:02:16.404 --> 03:02:30.729]  So he's a Jesuit creature and probably ultimately he's going to go and substitute Giuseppe Conte if he's not capable of putting together now the third coalition possibility.
[03:02:30.729 --> 03:02:35.351]  He's trying to, but I think it's going to be very difficult for him.
[03:02:35.851 --> 03:02:42.775]  Because there is this Matteo Renzi guy who of course wants to become foreign minister now that his friend Joe Biden is in the White House.
[03:02:42.775 --> 03:02:53.380]  So these people are all part of the same global insanity, global new world order led by China.
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:03:03.848]  That is, of course, destroying sovereignty and it's destroying populism because they perceive it as a very dangerous ideology.
[03:03:03.848 --> 03:03:06.330]  At the same time, we have, of course, the Vatican.
[03:03:06.330 --> 03:03:20.281]  The Vatican and the Pope, who has become more and more a political figure, criticizing any form of uprise, criticizing, of course, people who refuse the vaccine.
[03:03:20.281 --> 03:03:21.262]  And he himself,
[03:03:21.442 --> 03:03:33.085]  The Pope himself took the vaccine because his personal doctor died on the 9th of January, but then soon after he started to feel sick after taking the vaccine.
[03:03:33.085 --> 03:03:43.648]  So now the Pope, Shatika, which is this sickness he's been suffering for years is becoming actually worse after the vaccine.
[03:03:44.208 --> 03:03:53.733]  And there is a lot of worries in the Vatican because they didn't want the Pope to resign with Ratzinger still alive.
[03:03:53.733 --> 03:04:12.263]  Of course, it becomes then a political matter to elect the next Pope, but we know that Pope Francis has already nominated the right amount of cardinals to take over the next election and place another progressive Pope.
[03:04:12.683 --> 03:04:15.405]  Because that's what they want to do.
[03:04:15.405 --> 03:04:18.027]  And Davos, you mentioned Davos in your show.
[03:04:18.027 --> 03:04:34.677]  Of course, the Vatican also has given their support to the Great Reset, and it's more and more into this whole thing of destroying capitalism and substituting it with communism.
[03:04:34.677 --> 03:04:35.298]  At the same time,
[03:04:35.758 --> 03:04:43.506]  There is more and more heresies in the Church that are not only tolerated but even promoted.
[03:04:43.506 --> 03:04:56.060]  We have had also an attack on a Church here, a Catholic Church here in the United States, a few days ago by Antifa during a pro-life mass that was conducted, I think, by an Archbishop.
[03:04:56.440 --> 03:05:03.725]  And it was in Ohio and they stormed the church and there were children present and they were shouting profanities.
[03:05:03.725 --> 03:05:14.352]  And then we have also the Catholic LGBTQ community making a new movie about Jesus.
[03:05:14.352 --> 03:05:20.576]  And this is, of course, one year after what we have seen on Netflix, which was extremely controversial.
[03:05:21.316 --> 03:05:37.595]  This new movie is titled, Wonderfully Made, LGBTQ R Religion, and basically this film made by a film director who is Jewish but is married to a Catholic husband,
[03:05:38.215 --> 03:05:38.415]  Yes.
[03:05:57.641 --> 03:05:58.142]  We're good.
[03:06:23.363 --> 03:06:29.690]  Yeah, and that's just a form of intimidation.
[03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:34.996]  It's like, oh, you know, be pro-LGBTQ or, you know, your church may get burned to the ground.
[03:06:34.996 --> 03:06:36.798]  And, you know, it's a weird thing because...
[03:06:37.995 --> 03:06:39.316]  I mean, I was raised Catholic.
[03:06:39.316 --> 03:06:40.617]  I grew up Catholic.
[03:06:40.617 --> 03:06:42.458]  Catholics really used to look up to the Pope.
[03:06:42.458 --> 03:06:45.540]  I mean, Pope John Paul II was a hero in the Catholic community.
[03:06:45.540 --> 03:06:48.222]  Now, like, the Pope isn't even influential on Catholics.
[03:06:48.222 --> 03:06:50.583]  Like, they've just, I mean, it's like it doesn't even exist.
[03:06:50.583 --> 03:06:53.005]  Nobody looks to the Vatican for leadership anymore.
[03:06:53.005 --> 03:06:54.506]  So the Catholic Church is kind of lost in a way.
[03:06:56.347 --> 03:07:05.540]  But Leo, by the way, you made the prediction that they're going to announce, probably before the end of the year, that that African cardinal is going to be the next pope.
[03:07:05.540 --> 03:07:08.964]  But in the last 90 seconds here, Leo, make a prediction.
[03:07:08.964 --> 03:07:11.268]  What do you think happens with the current situation?
[03:07:11.268 --> 03:07:13.671]  What's the conclusion of the current situation of the Italian government?
[03:07:15.464 --> 03:07:18.686]  The Italian situation is simply a charade.
[03:07:18.686 --> 03:07:23.450]  In a way, you know, we see different kinds of charades taking place.
[03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:29.514]  Here in the U.S., you, unfortunately, have seen what has happened in Washington, D.C.
[03:07:29.514 --> 03:07:43.544]  In Italy, they haven't managed to riot or rebel in the same way, but they, of course, are taking away the interest of people from the main subject, which is being locked down in your own house.
[03:07:44.264 --> 03:07:53.606]  All these political circles, in the end, serve only the purpose, the main purpose, is to distract people.
[03:07:53.606 --> 03:08:06.790]  Because people, if they start thinking about the way they are oppressed, and the fact that they have to continuously pay tax and continuously feel this system which is completely corrupt and doesn't give any hope for them,
[03:08:08.170 --> 03:08:18.940]  Bars and restaurants out of 10 in Northern Italy, and this is an official news that has been reported yesterday, will go bankrupt.
[03:08:18.940 --> 03:08:26.987]  So that means that the Italian economy is really on the verge of some very big problems.
[03:08:26.987 --> 03:08:30.811]  And the people are getting more and more upset.
[03:08:30.811 --> 03:08:32.332]  So how are you going to control these people?
[03:08:32.332 --> 03:08:34.334]  Well, they simply silence them with censorship.
[03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:37.393]  LeoZagami.com.
[03:08:37.393 --> 03:08:39.416]  Leo, thank you for joining us today.
[03:08:39.416 --> 03:08:41.599]  I'm sure we'll be hearing from you again soon.
[03:08:41.599 --> 03:08:44.162]  People are fighting back against the New World Order, folks.
[03:08:44.162 --> 03:08:48.248]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[03:08:48.248 --> 03:08:49.550]  I just love it.
[03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:50.551]  I can't get enough of it.
[03:08:51.664 --> 03:08:53.906]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[03:08:53.906 --> 03:08:55.147]  That's what fills my mug.
[03:08:55.147 --> 03:08:56.288]  That's what fills my belly.
[03:08:56.288 --> 03:08:57.790]  That's what fills my soul.
[03:08:57.790 --> 03:08:59.732]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[03:08:59.732 --> 03:09:03.856]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:09:03.856 --> 03:09:04.476]  Years.
[03:09:04.476 --> 03:09:06.178]  Never raised the price.
[03:09:06.178 --> 03:09:06.478]  Never.
[03:09:06.478 --> 03:09:09.000]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:10.182]  The crew here loves it.
[03:09:10.182 --> 03:09:11.403]  We drink it every day.
[03:09:11.403 --> 03:09:15.847]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[03:09:16.007 --> 03:09:18.388]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[03:09:18.388 --> 03:09:23.969]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[03:09:23.969 --> 03:09:25.529]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[03:09:25.529 --> 03:09:26.789]  Pretty much perfect review there.
[03:09:26.789 --> 03:09:27.850]  4.9 star.
[03:09:27.850 --> 03:09:33.551]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[03:09:33.551 --> 03:09:37.532]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a 5 star, except maybe one or two people.
[03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:40.232]  Patriot Blend, 100% organic coffee.
[03:09:40.232 --> 03:09:43.153]  Only available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:09:45.903 --> 03:09:48.104]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[03:09:48.104 --> 03:09:51.186]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[03:09:51.186 --> 03:09:56.788]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:09:56.788 --> 03:09:59.049]  The subsection is PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:09:59.049 --> 03:10:00.650]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:02.491]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare.
[03:10:03.311 --> 03:10:06.253]  You need to understand that you need a 25-year food supply.
[03:10:06.253 --> 03:10:11.377]  The last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year's supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[03:10:11.377 --> 03:10:22.105]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[03:10:22.105 --> 03:10:26.088]  So, preparewithalex.com or infowarsstore.com, you can find
[03:10:26.348 --> 03:10:27.329]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:10:58.491 --> 03:11:08.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:11.502]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:11.502 --> 03:11:15.446]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:11:15.446 --> 03:11:17.067]  Here we are, folks.
[03:11:17.067 --> 03:11:20.991]  Good to be with you again here at InforWars, John Rappaport.
[03:11:22.355 --> 03:11:33.819]  Leading with a story today, which is the tip of the iceberg, a video from a man who states that he is a nurse's assistant at a nursing home.
[03:11:33.819 --> 03:11:37.220]  He's obviously been working there for a while.
[03:11:37.220 --> 03:11:47.743]  And he is making the claim that many people are dropping like flies in the nursing home after they're being injected with a COVID vaccine.
[03:11:47.743 --> 03:11:49.324]  He is saying that some of his
[03:11:51.132 --> 03:11:55.214]  Patients, people that he has been caring for have been dying.
[03:11:55.214 --> 03:12:01.517]  Others who were walking are now not able to walk.
[03:12:01.517 --> 03:12:07.880]  Some are now no longer able to talk.
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:20.386]  So, I would ordinarily say, okay, so let's exercise extreme caution here because we can't verify that this account is absolutely true.
[03:12:21.442 --> 03:12:30.429]  But there is common sense data to back it up, which I have been supplying for months and months and months now.
[03:12:30.429 --> 03:12:34.992]  And that is the following.
[03:12:34.992 --> 03:12:48.862]  In the major clinical trials of the vaccine, it's pretty obvious that the elderly and frail were not accepted as volunteers in the clinical trials.
[03:12:50.151 --> 03:13:10.006]  Therefore, there was no way to tell what the effects of the experimental vaccine were on these people, who are the people who are living in nursing homes, who are now being pushed close to the front of the line to receive the COVID vaccine.
[03:13:10.006 --> 03:13:14.009]  Now, if people who are ordinarily fairly healthy
[03:13:15.540 --> 03:13:23.844]  People who are receiving the vaccine are reporting adverse events, and we're seeing this breaking out all over the world.
[03:13:23.844 --> 03:13:34.069]  Unable to perform daily duties, can't go to work, and then presumably, supposedly, they recover.
[03:13:34.069 --> 03:13:37.951]  And these are people who are either very healthy or fairly healthy.
[03:13:38.709 --> 03:13:58.635]  Then what do you expect is going to be the effect of this vaccine on people who start out being frail, elderly, suffering from multiple health conditions for many years, have been treated for many years with toxic medications?
[03:13:58.635 --> 03:14:04.397]  What do you think is going to happen to them?
[03:14:04.397 --> 03:14:07.658]  It's obvious from a common sense point of view
[03:14:08.325 --> 03:14:18.093]  That many of them are going to become even more seriously ill, and many of them are going to die.
[03:14:18.093 --> 03:14:24.938]  We're talking about the forced, early, premature death of these people.
[03:14:24.938 --> 03:14:28.321]  The killing of these people via the vaccine.
[03:14:28.321 --> 03:14:29.422]  Murder.
[03:14:29.422 --> 03:14:34.666]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:14:34.666 --> 03:14:36.948]  I expect this story to be gaining
[03:14:38.641 --> 03:14:53.846]  Significant amount of force very quickly in the upcoming days and weeks as reports leak out from nursing homes about what is happening to the frail and elderly who are getting the vaccine.
[03:14:53.846 --> 03:14:57.687]  Again, just use your common sense.
[03:14:57.687 --> 03:15:06.870]  What do you think is going to happen to these people who were excluded from the clinical trials of the vaccine for obvious reasons
[03:15:07.668 --> 03:15:18.250]  That the pharmaceutical companies did not want to have these people folding up and dying when they get the vaccine during the clinical trials.
[03:15:18.250 --> 03:15:20.730]  So they were excluded.
[03:15:20.730 --> 03:15:23.711]  Well, they're not excluded now.
[03:15:23.711 --> 03:15:25.651]  This is not a clinical trial.
[03:15:25.651 --> 03:15:36.973]  This is a vast guinea pig experiment on a global basis using a technology that has never been brought to market before.
[03:15:38.247 --> 03:15:45.329]  It's been tried and it's failed to come to market.
[03:15:45.329 --> 03:15:46.429]  Why?
[03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:54.090]  Because of the adverse effects on the people that it's been experimented with.
[03:15:54.090 --> 03:16:02.832]  Talking mainly about serious autoimmune reactions.
[03:16:02.832 --> 03:16:05.733]  The body basically attacks itself.
[03:16:10.996 --> 03:16:23.078]  If you have people who are in these nursing homes, be aware of this information.
[03:16:23.078 --> 03:16:27.919]  I can't overstress it.
[03:16:27.919 --> 03:16:39.721]  Now, on a somewhat related note, I want to point to the shocking research of a woman from Canada named Christine Massey.
[03:16:41.286 --> 03:16:55.673]  She and her colleagues for many months now have been sending Freedom of Information Act requests to public health agencies in Canada and in other parts of the world.
[03:16:55.673 --> 03:17:08.000]  Very specific requests to provide records that prove and show that the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,
[03:17:09.514 --> 03:17:18.657]  Has ever really been isolated from a diseased patient?
[03:17:18.657 --> 03:17:27.241]  And in these FOIA requests, the conditions are very clearly spelled out.
[03:17:27.241 --> 03:17:38.705]  We're talking about the SARS-CoV-2 virus being separated out from any surrounding material.
[03:17:39.472 --> 03:17:48.759]  Any other viruses, bacteria, cellular material, genetic debris, etc., etc.
[03:17:48.759 --> 03:18:00.688]  Requesting that these public health agencies come through and provide records that show that this purported virus, SARS-CoV-2,
[03:18:01.730 --> 03:18:12.635]  Which is said to be the cause of a worldwide pandemic has ever really truly been isolated from a patient.
[03:18:12.635 --> 03:18:21.119]  Translation, has it ever really been proved to exist?
[03:18:21.119 --> 03:18:28.822]  So as I recently reported at No More Fake News, what Christine Massey and her colleagues have discovered
[03:18:31.118 --> 03:18:55.178]  In 46 separate cases where they submitted these FOIA requests to public health agencies in Canada and other parts of the world, the number of records that were returned to them supposedly proving that this virus has ever been isolated is zero.
[03:18:55.178 --> 03:18:56.219]  Zero.
[03:18:56.219 --> 03:18:57.540]  Zero.
[03:18:57.540 --> 03:18:59.982]  Zero records have been produced.
[03:19:00.791 --> 03:19:04.932]  In 46 separate instances.
[03:19:04.932 --> 03:19:07.933]  Typical reply goes something like this.
[03:19:07.933 --> 03:19:17.235]  We have no records at the agency here that would satisfy your request.
[03:19:17.235 --> 03:19:21.217]  Now this is completely astonishing.
[03:19:21.217 --> 03:19:26.518]  Talking about, yeah, there's a website for those of you who are watching here, Fluoride Free Peel.
[03:19:28.797 --> 03:19:36.359]  These public health agencies are admitting that they have no records proving that the virus has ever been isolated.
[03:19:36.359 --> 03:19:38.139]  And this isn't just one agency.
[03:19:38.139 --> 03:19:38.579]  46.
[03:19:38.579 --> 03:19:41.840]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:43.040]  We told you it was coming.
[03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:54.522]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them a social distance and report them back to cell towers to track their every movement.
[03:19:54.522 --> 03:19:55.643]  This is for everybody.
[03:19:55.643 --> 03:19:56.443]  The way that it's better.
[03:19:57.183 --> 03:20:07.732]  Now, France has programs in their factories, government-pushed and sponsored, to make everyone wear actual dog collars so that we can make you social distance and report back to simple computers.
[03:20:07.732 --> 03:20:09.934]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[03:20:09.934 --> 03:20:12.436]  Human-animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[03:20:12.436 --> 03:20:13.597]  It's all being announced.
[03:20:13.597 --> 03:20:18.081]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete.
[03:20:18.081 --> 03:20:23.566]  And big corporations now claim that they own us with these gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[03:20:23.566 --> 03:20:24.626]  Do you understand?
[03:20:24.626 --> 03:20:25.247]  It is a taker.
[03:20:25.387 --> 03:20:25.867]  We're good.
[03:20:43.274 --> 03:20:50.116]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in floors are no longer available.
[03:20:50.116 --> 03:20:57.977]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[03:20:57.977 --> 03:21:00.038]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[03:21:00.038 --> 03:21:05.819]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[03:21:05.819 --> 03:21:10.280]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[03:21:10.640 --> 03:21:15.763]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[03:21:15.763 --> 03:21:18.685]  And by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months.
[03:21:18.685 --> 03:21:20.126]  It's now back in stock as well.
[03:21:20.126 --> 03:21:22.128]  They're great products and it funds the InfoWare.

[03:21:30.513 --> 03:21:31.434]  It's concentrated.
[03:21:31.434 --> 03:21:32.535]  People love it.
[03:21:32.535 --> 03:21:33.215]  It's amazing.
[03:21:33.215 --> 03:21:34.776]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[03:21:34.776 --> 03:21:36.577]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[03:21:36.577 --> 03:21:38.799]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:21:38.799 --> 03:21:39.759]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:21:42.461 --> 03:21:43.561]  I've got some bad news.
[03:21:43.561 --> 03:21:51.925]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[03:21:51.925 --> 03:21:53.406]  But here's the good news.
[03:21:53.406 --> 03:22:01.650]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[03:22:02.390 --> 03:22:08.051]  One is Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[03:22:08.051 --> 03:22:08.752]  People love it.
[03:22:08.752 --> 03:22:10.072]  That's selling out.
[03:22:10.072 --> 03:22:13.413]  Despite that, it's still discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:13.413 --> 03:22:17.454]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:22:17.454 --> 03:22:19.734]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:22:19.734 --> 03:22:20.535]  People really love it.
[03:22:20.535 --> 03:22:22.335]  It's extremely strong as well.
[03:22:22.335 --> 03:22:23.455]  It's selling out.
[03:22:23.455 --> 03:22:26.496]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[03:22:26.496 --> 03:22:30.417]  It also funds the InfoWars and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[03:22:30.837 --> 03:22:32.639]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:22:32.639 --> 03:22:40.446]  Please visit Infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the InfoWar.
[03:22:40.446 --> 03:22:45.490]  God bless and good luck!
[03:22:45.490 --> 03:22:48.093]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:23:04.116 --> 03:23:06.778]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:23:06.778 --> 03:23:09.060]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:09.060 --> 03:23:12.022]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[03:23:12.022 --> 03:23:21.670]  Back in the second section here, got two stories concerning Biden and Trump.
[03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:28.696]  Perhaps you've noticed that some of the governors are now talking about, well, we're going to loosen up the lockdown somewhat now.
[03:23:29.748 --> 03:23:32.649]  And because statistics show that blah, blah, blah.
[03:23:32.649 --> 03:23:38.390]  No, the statistics, which are all fake anyway, are not showing anything.
[03:23:38.390 --> 03:23:42.111]  It's obvious that, well, Biden has been installed as president.
[03:23:42.111 --> 03:23:49.553]  So now we've done our job, the governors are thinking, and so now we can start loosening up the lockdowns.
[03:23:49.553 --> 03:23:57.175]  Because obviously part of the whole scenario here was ensuring that
[03:23:57.577 --> 03:24:23.054]  Titanic numbers of mail-in ballots would be used in the election, which would make stealing it very much easier and keeping people at home rather than showing up at the polls, which shows you the, I mean, this is, I mean, the depth, the depth of the need to get rid of Trump.
[03:24:23.054 --> 03:24:26.476]  The depth of that operation to get rid of him.
[03:24:27.162 --> 03:24:36.848]  Of course, we've seen over the past five, six years, predating this election in the first place, how serious that move was.
[03:24:36.848 --> 03:24:42.252]  But when you consider that, oh, it's very serious lockdowns, they've got to lock down everybody, lock down everybody.
[03:24:42.252 --> 03:24:43.253]  Oh, Biden's elected.
[03:24:43.253 --> 03:24:49.397]  Okay, well, you know, actually, we can loosen up the lockdowns a little bit now, for now, anyway.
[03:24:49.397 --> 03:24:53.319]  And we do need to open up the economy, blah, blah, blah.
[03:24:53.319 --> 03:24:55.861]  I mean, talk about cynical.
[03:24:56.815 --> 03:25:06.519]  Criminality on the part of these grotesque, hideous, gargoyle governors.
[03:25:06.519 --> 03:25:08.559]  It's absolutely astounding.
[03:25:08.559 --> 03:25:14.842]  And so from there, we move to the impeachment process now taking place in the U.S.
[03:25:14.842 --> 03:25:19.683]  Senate to impeach Trump.
[03:25:19.683 --> 03:25:24.245]  It reminds me, if you remember the old comedy Animal House.
[03:25:25.512 --> 03:25:44.904]  Where the Dean tells the fraternity, actually you've been on, what did he call it, something like super secret probation, and you violated your probation, so therefore you're banned from campus.
[03:25:44.904 --> 03:25:53.690]  I mean, this impeachment trial, you know, raising serious constitutional questions?
[03:25:53.690 --> 03:25:53.910]  Come on.
[03:25:55.089 --> 03:26:08.878]  This is like a mock trial being staged at some hokey law school, which barely is able to graduate students.
[03:26:08.878 --> 03:26:22.047]  And the mock trial is being put on and carried out by the worst of those students, parading as if they're really lawyers, and in this case, really
[03:26:23.911 --> 03:26:27.052]  Legislators in the Senate.
[03:26:27.052 --> 03:26:48.822]  I mean, the whole thing has absolutely no value meaning whatsoever, except propaganda value for extreme yokels and rubes who actually think that the Constitution has something to say about impeaching a president who has already left office
[03:26:49.488 --> 03:27:17.227]  When, in fact, all you have to do is read the Constitution and you see, A, that the impeachment trial has only to do with removing a sitting president, not a president who is no longer sitting but has left the presidency, and B, that this impeachment trial has to be presided over by the
[03:27:19.358 --> 03:27:32.649]  Head of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice, in this case is John Roberts, who has said that he's not going to preside over this and that he really doesn't care to comment on why not.
[03:27:32.649 --> 03:27:37.833]  I mean, you know, this guy is supposed to be the number one lawyer in the country.
[03:27:37.833 --> 03:27:48.942]  So you would think that if he is saying, I'm not going to preside over this impeachment trial, that he's going to make a statement about why not.
[03:27:49.929 --> 03:27:54.531]  To inform the people of America.
[03:27:54.531 --> 03:27:55.852]  What?
[03:27:55.852 --> 03:27:57.733]  That the trial is a sham?
[03:27:57.733 --> 03:27:59.114]  That it isn't legitimate?
[03:27:59.114 --> 03:28:00.574]  It isn't constitutional?
[03:28:00.574 --> 03:28:01.455]  It isn't legal?
[03:28:01.455 --> 03:28:04.776]  It has absolutely no merit or meaning whatsoever?
[03:28:04.776 --> 03:28:11.660]  That it's nothing more than a propaganda exercise being carried out by rhinos and Democrats?
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:14.941]  He's going to say something.
[03:28:14.941 --> 03:28:16.822]  But he refrains.
[03:28:16.822 --> 03:28:18.003]  Ah yes, he refrains.
[03:28:18.783 --> 03:28:24.164]  And, of course, the media are going along with the following narrative.
[03:28:24.164 --> 03:28:36.107]  Well, you see, if it were an impeachment of a sitting president, then the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts, would be presiding.
[03:28:36.107 --> 03:28:46.330]  But since this is a different sort of impeachment than Patrick Leahy, who has been serving in the Senate as a Democrat since 1843,
[03:28:48.490 --> 03:28:54.112]  He is stepping up to the plate to preside over this different kind of impeachment.
[03:28:54.112 --> 03:29:16.201]  Yeah, the different kind of impeachment, which is no impeachment whatsoever, which is at best a mock trial being carried out by idiots, which has no meaning whatsoever under the Constitution, no legal value, nothing whatsoever to do with fact or law in the United States.
[03:29:19.130 --> 03:29:38.442]  RINOs and Democrats are very seriously pretending that it does in fact have something to do with a legal proceeding, which tells you something about these people and their character, right?
[03:29:38.442 --> 03:29:41.364]  Okay, boys and girls, now here's the deal.
[03:29:41.364 --> 03:29:43.966]  Keep a straight face when you talk to the press.
[03:29:44.642 --> 03:29:46.263]  Don't break out in a grin.
[03:29:46.263 --> 03:29:59.234]  Don't start laughing uncontrollably when you say that we're going to stage an impeachment of a president who is no longer president in contravention of the Constitution.
[03:29:59.234 --> 03:30:11.123]  And that the Chief Justice is not going to preside, but we're going to take one of the oldest hack jobs in the Senate, Pat Leahy, and we're going to prop him up and put him there
[03:30:11.721 --> 03:30:15.724]  at the head to preside over this fake trial.
[03:30:15.724 --> 03:30:23.230]  Don't break up laughing and smiling and grinning and falling down because you can't stop laughing.
[03:30:23.230 --> 03:30:36.539]  You've got to keep a straight face about the whole thing as we proceed in impeaching the president who is not a president who is now a private citizen.
[03:30:36.539 --> 03:30:38.761]  Right?
[03:30:38.761 --> 03:30:41.083]  And even if this fails, which
[03:30:41.730 --> 03:30:46.914]  It looks like it's going to, to get a two-thirds vote from the Senate.
[03:30:46.914 --> 03:30:57.481]  Keep in mind, boys and girls, that we can always come back after the midterm elections if we get enough rhinos and Democrats to make it happen again.
[03:30:57.481 --> 03:31:00.984]  And we can impeach Trump 30 years from now if we have to.
[03:31:00.984 --> 03:31:09.590]  Whatever it takes to completely erase him and all of his supporters as if they never existed because they're dangerous.
[03:31:10.401 --> 03:31:28.671]  Because they're extremely dangerous, because for one reason or another, we don't know why they care about something called freedom, which we're in the process of completely outlawing in every form that we can possibly think of, so that we make everybody into slaves, etc, etc, etc.
[03:31:33.254 --> 03:31:34.975]  That's the picture, folks.
[03:31:34.975 --> 03:31:42.619]  That's what's going on with the so-called impeachment that is taking place now in the Senate.
[03:31:42.619 --> 03:31:49.743]  And again, as I'm turning a page here in my notes, I have to take lawyers to task.
[03:31:49.743 --> 03:31:57.348]  I'm talking about not the lawyers in the country who are speaking out and saying that the whole thing is a sham and a farce.
[03:31:58.075 --> 03:32:05.261]  But the thousands of other lawyers who know it's a sham and a farce and are not saying anything.
[03:32:05.261 --> 03:32:09.204]  I'm not talking about the fact they have to file cases in courts.
[03:32:09.204 --> 03:32:09.905]  They have to write.
[03:32:09.905 --> 03:32:11.326]  They have to speak out.
[03:32:11.326 --> 03:32:12.867]  They have to do podcasts.
[03:32:12.867 --> 03:32:14.508]  They have to go on shows.
[03:32:14.508 --> 03:32:16.790]  They have to say the whole thing is illegitimate.
[03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:18.051]  It's unconstitutional.
[03:32:18.051 --> 03:32:19.533]  It's insane.
[03:32:19.533 --> 03:32:24.837]  And any bar association that doesn't say it's insane loses all credibility.
[03:32:25.535 --> 03:32:26.916]  Why aren't they speaking up?
[03:32:26.916 --> 03:32:28.957]  Because they're cowards.
[03:32:28.957 --> 03:32:30.839]  Because they're fakes and frauds.
[03:32:30.839 --> 03:32:32.240]  That's why.
[03:32:32.240 --> 03:32:35.642]  Because they don't deserve to be called attorneys.
[03:32:37.699 --> 03:32:38.700]  We'll be back.
[03:32:38.700 --> 03:32:45.186]  Don't go anywhere after the break here on... All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:32:45.186 --> 03:32:55.795]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:32:55.795 --> 03:33:01.780]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:01.960 --> 03:33:10.522]  The new Rocket Rest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[03:33:10.522 --> 03:33:20.605]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[03:33:20.605 --> 03:33:28.227]  It uses a unique quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium,
[03:33:28.407 --> 03:33:33.132]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.

[03:33:40.700 --> 03:33:44.562]  Globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[03:33:44.562 --> 03:33:47.123]  They are forcing mutations.
[03:33:47.123 --> 03:33:50.745]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[03:33:50.745 --> 03:33:59.268]  When you look at all the major research, all the major progress they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[03:33:59.268 --> 03:33:59.909]  No.
[03:33:59.909 --> 03:34:02.450]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[03:34:02.450 --> 03:34:09.493]  Now we see some propaganda, like communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen!
[03:34:09.973 --> 03:34:13.075]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[03:34:13.075 --> 03:34:20.380]  Well, the same thing's been happening to our troops, and thousands and thousands have died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[03:34:20.380 --> 03:34:24.943]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[03:34:24.943 --> 03:34:28.546]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[03:34:28.546 --> 03:34:30.047]  But that's not even true.
[03:34:30.047 --> 03:34:34.109]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[03:34:34.109 --> 03:34:39.513]  This is violence being carried out against us by medical terrorism, and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[03:34:41.814 --> 03:34:50.600]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[03:34:50.600 --> 03:34:57.365]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it.
[03:34:57.785 --> 03:34:59.006]  This does not have the fluoride.
[03:34:59.006 --> 03:35:00.406]  It doesn't have the additives.
[03:35:00.406 --> 03:35:01.627]  This is a concentrate.
[03:35:01.627 --> 03:35:03.087]  It really is high quality.
[03:35:03.087 --> 03:35:08.249]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[03:35:08.249 --> 03:35:10.030]  But now it's back in stock.
[03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:14.452]  InfoWars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.

[03:35:42.130 --> 03:35:43.331]  I've got some bad news.
[03:35:43.331 --> 03:35:51.621]  Our best-selling Vitamin Mineral Fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times, it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[03:35:51.621 --> 03:35:53.082]  But here's the good news.
[03:35:53.082 --> 03:36:01.351]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[03:36:02.052 --> 03:36:07.737]  One is BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% curcuminoid.
[03:36:07.737 --> 03:36:08.418]  People love it.
[03:36:08.418 --> 03:36:09.759]  That's selling out.
[03:36:09.759 --> 03:36:13.101]  Despite that, it's still discounted at MFULWARESTORE.COM.
[03:36:13.101 --> 03:36:17.145]  And then also selling out this week is our Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:36:17.145 --> 03:36:19.407]  It's called Liquid Turmeric Extract.
[03:36:19.407 --> 03:36:20.227]  People really love it.
[03:36:20.227 --> 03:36:21.989]  It's extremely strong as well.
[03:36:21.989 --> 03:36:23.150]  It's selling out.

[03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:47.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:36:53.820 --> 03:37:06.767]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:37:06.767 --> 03:37:07.447]  Okay.
[03:37:07.447 --> 03:37:09.668]  Last segment here in this hour.
[03:37:09.668 --> 03:37:11.029]  John Rappaport.
[03:37:11.029 --> 03:37:18.012]  I've got to say something about Biden.
[03:37:18.012 --> 03:37:21.054]  This is another one of these.
[03:37:21.054 --> 03:37:23.315]  How can we possibly believe this?
[03:37:24.659 --> 03:37:31.083]  Talking about the mental incapacity of the man.
[03:37:31.083 --> 03:37:40.610]  You know, in 1990, 1988, he suffered a brain aneurysm and pulmonary thrombosis.
[03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:42.371]  Had two surgeries.
[03:37:42.371 --> 03:37:44.753]  This was very serious.
[03:37:44.753 --> 03:37:49.837]  Wasn't some, you know, little light business here.
[03:37:49.837 --> 03:37:53.159]  And to anybody but the
[03:37:54.346 --> 03:38:01.933]  Slumbering his mental cognitive decline was obvious.
[03:38:01.933 --> 03:38:04.235]  There have been numerous videos made.
[03:38:04.235 --> 03:38:09.700]  You're looking at one who, if you're watching now with a pen, where do I put the pen?
[03:38:09.700 --> 03:38:13.022]  How do I get it in my pocket?
[03:38:13.022 --> 03:38:21.410]  He's walking out past a line of Marines and he says, salute the Marines, but he doesn't salute them.
[03:38:23.410 --> 03:38:29.213]  Uh, he's listening, it appears, to somebody in his earpiece saying, salute the Marines.
[03:38:29.213 --> 03:38:32.735]  But instead of saluting them, he repeats what they're telling him.
[03:38:32.735 --> 03:38:37.398]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[03:38:37.398 --> 03:38:45.742]  This was apparent long ago to any except the slumbering.
[03:38:45.742 --> 03:38:48.924]  It was apparent when he announced for the presidency.
[03:38:48.924 --> 03:38:50.685]  It was apparent during the campaign.
[03:38:52.526 --> 03:38:54.467]  If you want to call it a campaign.
[03:38:54.467 --> 03:39:03.432]  I mean, he was talking with dozens of people who would show up at these little rallies and so forth.
[03:39:03.432 --> 03:39:10.296]  Very, very light campaigning, minimal to keep him away from the public.
[03:39:10.296 --> 03:39:17.681]  And gaffes and confusions and incoherence and so on and so.
[03:39:17.681 --> 03:39:20.542]  My point being.
[03:39:20.542 --> 03:39:21.683]  During the campaign.
[03:39:23.442 --> 03:39:38.270]  Did any rhino Republican seriously hammer on this as being very dangerous?
[03:39:38.270 --> 03:39:44.153]  Did any mainstream media outlet hammer on this?
[03:39:44.153 --> 03:39:50.616]  Say, hey, we're in the process of possibly electing, installing
[03:39:52.182 --> 03:40:00.648]  A seriously impaired man as the next President of the United States.
[03:40:00.648 --> 03:40:06.952]  A disabled human.
[03:40:06.952 --> 03:40:09.574]  Where are his medical records?
[03:40:09.574 --> 03:40:15.938]  Eh, we understand they're confidential and so forth, but you see when somebody is running
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:32.164]  As a candidate for a major party for the presidency of the United States, doesn't it stand to reason that we have a right to know whether he is coherent?
[03:40:32.164 --> 03:40:45.527]  Whether he is cognitively challenged on a physical level to a very serious degree and is in rapid decline?
[03:40:45.527 --> 03:40:45.927]  Yes?
[03:40:45.927 --> 03:40:45.967]  No?
[03:40:47.102 --> 03:40:51.204]  Are we not able to find out this information?
[03:40:51.204 --> 03:40:57.688]  Because from all outward signs, that's what we're seeing.
[03:40:57.688 --> 03:41:06.533]  Doesn't matter if he's Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Constitutional Party, Martian Party.
[03:41:06.533 --> 03:41:08.874]  What difference does it make?
[03:41:08.874 --> 03:41:14.277]  This guy could be elected as the next president and we demand to know
[03:41:14.986 --> 03:41:18.429]  And we are not going to stop demanding to know.
[03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:25.214]  And I pointed this out in articles at the time.
[03:41:25.214 --> 03:41:28.036]  The guy is in serious trouble.
[03:41:28.036 --> 03:41:32.960]  That's what you would say if he was just another guy.
[03:41:32.960 --> 03:41:34.221]  He can't remember.
[03:41:34.221 --> 03:41:36.343]  He can't articulate.
[03:41:36.343 --> 03:41:39.826]  He's confusing one thing with another.
[03:41:41.343 --> 03:41:59.077]  We're on the verge, possibly, of electing or installing or faking our way into putting this man in the Oval Office.
[03:41:59.077 --> 03:42:06.283]  But media outlets are under orders to stay away from this, don't bring it up, et cetera, et cetera, don't even mention it.
[03:42:06.283 --> 03:42:08.344]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:42:08.344 --> 03:42:10.526]  This is the only Democrat with any kind of
[03:42:11.226 --> 03:42:24.752]  Name recognition who isn't considered too radical on the left like Sanders or Warren to, you know, even have a chance at the presidency and we have to shut up about it and we can't talk about it.
[03:42:24.752 --> 03:42:27.134]  We can't bring it up and et cetera, et cetera.
[03:42:27.134 --> 03:42:38.019]  And now we look around and there is this guy sitting in the Oval Office.
[03:42:38.019 --> 03:42:38.299]  I mean,
[03:42:38.991 --> 03:42:55.822]  When people say that America is beginning to look like a joke in the eyes of other nations, and they cite various ridiculous reasons for saying that, here's an actual reason for saying it.
[03:42:55.822 --> 03:42:57.163]  Look what they did in America.
[03:42:57.163 --> 03:43:03.487]  They elected this guy, and I'm not even confident that he knows his name all the time.
[03:43:10.959 --> 03:43:12.579]  It's just beyond appeal.
[03:43:12.579 --> 03:43:17.041]  It's beyond belief.
[03:43:17.041 --> 03:43:25.045]  With a guy like that, it doesn't matter what his policies are, because does he remember what his policies are?
[03:43:25.045 --> 03:43:26.665]  Does it matter?
[03:43:26.665 --> 03:43:34.929]  Because he's obviously being controlled as a puppet on strings by a committee, by people behind him.
[03:43:36.365 --> 03:43:44.406]  And those of you watching see a picture of Biden from the early years before I would say the surgeries and so forth.
[03:43:44.406 --> 03:44:02.290]  I watched him in the old, old, old, old days on the Sunday talk shows where he was a frequent guest as a foreign policy wonk in the Senate because he's been in the Senate forever.
[03:44:02.290 --> 03:44:03.330]  He was a sharp talker.
[03:44:05.805 --> 03:44:10.606]  I didn't agree with what he was saying or his policies, but he was a sharp talker.
[03:44:10.606 --> 03:44:12.746]  He was quick.
[03:44:12.746 --> 03:44:18.487]  You know, one of the usual idiot hosts would ask him a softball question and he would give you the answer.
[03:44:18.487 --> 03:44:19.508]  Russia, you see?
[03:44:19.508 --> 03:44:21.128]  Here's what Russia has actually been doing.
[03:44:21.128 --> 03:44:23.528]  And this is what we have to do.
[03:44:23.528 --> 03:44:26.349]  And here we've tried these negotiations, whatever.
[03:44:26.349 --> 03:44:32.750]  He was fully cognizant, aware of his mental capacity and was exercising it.
[03:44:33.433 --> 03:44:40.077]  But all of that has completely changed.
[03:44:40.077 --> 03:45:01.009]  And America has descended, at least half of it anyway, into the depths of such idiocracy that an entire presidential campaign could be conducted and nobody in major media or major politics hammers on the fact
[03:45:01.587 --> 03:45:23.712]  Relentlessly, over and over again, that we have to see this guy's records, medical records, because we could be electing somebody who is medically incompetent, who is severely disabled, as president.
[03:45:23.712 --> 03:45:25.433]  Didn't happen.
[03:45:25.433 --> 03:45:26.453]  Didn't happen at all.
[03:45:27.318 --> 03:45:33.721]  Yeah, there were occasional mentions of this, and people would giggle and say, can you believe this guy?
[03:45:33.721 --> 03:45:36.262]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:45:36.262 --> 03:45:43.465]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:45:43.465 --> 03:45:51.908]  This gives you an indication of where the hypnotic level and the IQ level of at least half the country
[03:45:53.115 --> 03:45:53.715]  Have some.
[03:45:53.715 --> 03:45:58.456]  And you could say, well, they just didn't care because all they wanted to do was get rid of Trump.
[03:45:58.456 --> 03:46:03.297]  And it didn't matter which Democrat they dragged across the finish line.
[03:46:03.297 --> 03:46:05.918]  In this case, it was Biden.
[03:46:05.918 --> 03:46:07.658]  Yeah, true.
[03:46:07.658 --> 03:46:15.980]  But again, the man is severely disabled.
[03:46:15.980 --> 03:46:18.280]  Meaning.
[03:46:18.280 --> 03:46:21.361]  Totally unreliable in what he says.
[03:46:22.102 --> 03:46:39.506]  Thinks, remembers, signs, you know, as in executive orders, signs, advocates from day to day.
[03:46:39.506 --> 03:46:47.608]  And I can hear people saying, well, yeah, but you know, so what?
[03:46:47.608 --> 03:46:50.629]  Yeah, so what?
[03:46:50.629 --> 03:46:51.689]  So what, huh?
[03:46:53.311 --> 03:47:01.453]  I mean, of course, it's obvious Kamala Harris is waiting in the wings to take over when Biden is unable to finish his term and all of that.
[03:47:01.453 --> 03:47:06.615]  We understand all of this new world order accelerates, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:47:06.615 --> 03:47:12.316]  But I'm just getting to the ground level fact here.
[03:47:12.316 --> 03:47:17.758]  The nation has to be rescued from basic idiocracy completely.
[03:47:18.596 --> 03:47:27.311]  Thinking people have to think and speak out on every level as to what is going on.
[03:47:27.311 --> 03:47:28.753]  John Rappaport here.
[03:47:28.753 --> 03:47:29.595]  We're in for wars.
