[00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.623]  I am a shotgun rider.
[00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:18.010]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.313]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:30.680]  I was riding on the Polk Coast and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:36.224]  The bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:42.910]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.673]  Oh, that's some great music from the highway back in the 1980s.
[00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:49.398]  This little part here about the river Gambler is even better.
[00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:56.226]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:24.263]  I gotta tell you, I am so honored to have the best crew I've ever had in 27 years on air, to have them put up with me, and to have you, the viewers and listeners, and the fact that we're so aligned right now, we are so simpatico right now, with the effect we're having.
[00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:28.184]  In fact, it's very, very humbling, and I'm just very, very blessed to be here.
[00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:33.586]  We have Robert Barnes coming up on this Monday, July 5th edition.
[00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:49.530]  And there's just so much craziness going on and I always, I'm almost even ashamed to try to promote what we're doing at the end, but with what's happening in the world, the attacks on free speech, the deplatforming, everything I have would just run this place three months.
[00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:11.183]  And I've already begun the process to put everything I've got, my little 10 cents, a widow's mind in this fight, but I just want listeners to understand that whatever happens, it's in God's plan, but you really should take every broadcast we do, potentially as the last, because you should take every day your electricity turns on as its last.
[00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:16.347]  You should take every day that your husband or wife's alive as its last, because, um,
[00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.872]  You know, I'm always an optimist, but I'm not gonna lie to you.
[00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.835]  We're entering an end of days beginning.
[00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:30.280]  And this may be a foreshadowing, that's how history works, for something ten years from now, maybe a thousand years from now, I don't know.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.804]  But gut level, I've already basically said my last rites.
[00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.406]  And I'm not suicidal, it's the opposite of that.
[00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:41.869]  I just am extremely close to God now, and I've
[00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:49.735]  Gone through a transmutation in the last few weeks of preparing for death.
[00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:51.578]  And I've never done that.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.205]  And it's because they're killing a lot of people.
[00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.650]  A lot of people are being poisoned.
[00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.730]  Millions are dying right now from these injections.
[00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:04.452]  And those of us that love God spiritually can feel that death.
[00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:06.573]  And that's very painful for us.
[00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:07.673]  It's very painful for you.
[00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:08.913]  And I understand that.
[00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:12.015]  But, you know, it's all part of God's plan.
[00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:23.559]  And this is what we did by killing 70 million babies in this country and hundreds of millions in China, is that God said, listen, if you're going to bully your kids, I'm going to let Satan kill you.
[00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.020]  And so it's, uh,
[00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.679]  It's not God doing it.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.082]  It's that we forgot God, and we opened the door to Satan.
[00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:35.763]  And so we're gonna get hurt.
[00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:39.344]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:41.225]  Because God's just.
[00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:43.406]  And God is justice.
[00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:52.170]  So, God's gonna give us a chance to rally right now, and to back this off, and to say no to this thing.
[00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.791]  And like none of it, we may get a hundred year reprieve.
[00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:59.037]  Do you even want that rebrief?
[00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:01.199]  Be honest.
[00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:04.682]  We're not desperate.
[00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:06.223]  We're not fatalistic.
[00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:08.485]  We're not giving in to Satan.
[00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:13.048]  And we're going to continue on in the right course.
[00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:14.973]  And trust in Christ.
[00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:23.857]  But we're not going to get upset at ourselves, and mad at ourselves, and we're not going to commit suicide, or we're not going to get depressed because we can't overcome Satan.
[00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:28.979]  Because it's not us that overcome Satan, it's Christ, the Son of God.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.380]  We're not here to overcome Satan.
[00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:36.042]  We're here to be tested by Satan.
[00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:39.903]  We're here to be attacked by Satan.
[00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:49.067]  We're here to get our ribs broke, our eyes gouged out, to show we're faithful.
[00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:56.072]  Because you don't get eternal life in a trillion Valhalla's without a test.
[00:04:56.953 --> 00:04:58.314]  And now you will be tested.
[00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.115]  You will face Satan.
[00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:02.096]  Make no mistake.
[00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.800]  Attention projectionists.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.464]  Adjust the lens so that your picture will be focused properly before the show starts.
[00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:35.249]  Watch the American Journal weekday mornings 8 to 11 central at band.video.
[00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.633]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:41.053 --> 00:05:42.614]  Because there is a war on.
[00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:45.516]  For your mind.
[00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:52.481]  It's the War Room with Owen Schreier.
[00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:55.603]  Please stand by for further details.
[00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:57.945]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:15.012]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:15.452 --> 00:06:18.613]  And it is Monday, July 5th.
[00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:27.856]  The year is 2021 and I wanted to start the broadcast with Robert Barnes, a constitutional lawyer, good friend of mine, really smart historian.
[00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:31.838]  He was on with us a week ago and he really captured the world's attention.
[00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:40.468]  He captured my attention when he said, it's through that grain of sand, he quoted a famous philosopher, that sometimes we can see the world through a microcosm.
[00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:44.171]  We see the duplication that's happening over and over again.
[00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:49.155]  And Britney Spears, not allowed to have children, not allowed to drive a car, given $2,000 a week.
[00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:54.583]  Well, her family got $150 million a year.
[00:06:55.343 --> 00:07:00.726]  The idea that slavery like that could happen today really captured people's attention.
[00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:11.072]  So, as we declare independence against the New World Order, I wanted to get Barnes back up to just talk about that as a microcosm, but also the allegory of that collapsed Miami.
[00:07:12.092 --> 00:07:15.175]  Condo, that they knew for years had structural problems.
[00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:17.436]  They knew about leaking seawater in.
[00:07:17.457 --> 00:07:19.698]  They knew about too many construction sites around it.
[00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:28.986]  But people were in denial, just like Deepwater Horizon with the whole BP spill, where the engineer said, if you don't put concrete in the hole, it will explode.
[00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:32.629]  And BP said, we're a $45 million company at the time.
[00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:33.770]  These are real quotes that came out in court.
[00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.153]  We're invincible, as if that money suspended the laws of physics.
[00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:39.975]  So I see all this as an allegory
[00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:55.702]  Britney Spears is the awakening, but also the collapsed, tragic event at the condo, and the denial there, and the Deepwater Horizon, and the imploding borders, and the out-of-control money printing, and Homeland Security trying to declare war on the American people.
[00:07:55.902 --> 00:07:57.784]  We're going to cover it all in this first hour!
[00:07:58.484 --> 00:08:00.965]  Today, so important, I wanted to get Robert Barnes up front.
[00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:06.688]  Mr. Barnes, you did a great job, but I read the comments in the video that got a half million views on Mandop Video.
[00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:08.009]  People were like, shut up, Jones.
[00:08:08.429 --> 00:08:11.851]  Let Barnes really go with the Britney Spears thing.
[00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:14.913]  So I want to hit a bunch of other issues with you, but first, this segment and the next.
[00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:18.895]  Recap what you were saying in the latest developments there, because that really got people's attention.
[00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:20.605]  Absolutely.
[00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:26.712]  I mean, there was some fake news last week that the judge had actually ruled against Britney Spears after she testified.
[00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:27.673]  That was inaccurate.
[00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:31.257]  That was an old order that got just recently published.
[00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:37.704]  In fact, the judge is now apparently going to schedule an evidentiary hearing and the big trustee that was supposed to be coming in
[00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:49.156]  Now says, based on what Britney testified to, they no longer want to be part of the Bee Trustee and basically are supporting her claim to end the conservatorship and end the guardianship altogether.
[00:08:49.376 --> 00:08:54.081]  There's a great film that was on Netflix recently called, basically called, I Care A Lot.
[00:08:54.501 --> 00:09:07.231]  And it's, and it describes, it uses sort of fictitious narrative to, like James L. Roy or like John le Carre or one of the others, to describe something that's very real, which is the problem of guardianship law in America.
[00:09:07.532 --> 00:09:20.102]  But it is a microcosm of the much broader concern that what the world, what the George Soros and Bill Gates of the world want to do to us, is they want to treat all of us the way those conservators have treated Britney Spears.
[00:09:20.502 --> 00:09:24.144]  That they basically, they've controlled her labor for more than 12 years.
[00:09:24.484 --> 00:09:25.785]  They've controlled her medicine.
[00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:35.951]  They've controlled what, what, whether she could even have children or has things forced into her, basically forced sterilizations and IUDs she has wanted out for a while.
[00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:42.735]  They decide whom she dates and whom she goes out with, whether she takes a vacation, where she works, when she works, under what conditions she works.
[00:09:43.355 --> 00:10:02.719]  And it's part of the Epstein-Bill Gates story that was really under-told, which is the whole Bill Gates agenda is a control-driven agenda, which he's sought out the patents to be able to put a chip in you that would control vaccine release, that would control your medical information, that would control your identity, that would also control your financial information.
[00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:09.260]  We saw information last week come out where former high-ranking bank executives are talking about digital global currencies.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.966]  So what we see in Britney Spears, someone who is extraordinarily well off, is that even she couldn't control her own life.
[00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:24.132]  She couldn't even control her own doctors, control her own medicine, control her own money, control her own property, control her own labor.
[00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:28.315]  It's that extreme degree of control, as portrayed in the movie I Care A Lot,
[00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:40.083]  And as portrayed in the real life example of Britney Spears, that Bill Gates and George Soros want to impose on the entire world, using things like COVID as a pretext and predicate to achieve it and accomplish it.
[00:10:40.483 --> 00:10:43.645]  And I think in that perspective, if we understand the significance of that,
[00:10:44.105 --> 00:11:00.392]  And the dangerous legal loopholes that are established by Guardian laws that have now been replicated in various COVID laws, then we understand what we're up against and how and why it is critical that we resist and support the efforts that she is making, Britney Spears is making, to speak out against what has happened and taken place to her.
[00:11:00.773 --> 00:11:02.073]  But she is a warning sign.
[00:11:02.113 --> 00:11:03.294]  She is an alarm signal.
[00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:05.715]  She is a red flag of what's to come.
[00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:10.457]  In that same capacity, that's intending what a lot of red flag laws are really about.
[00:11:10.817 --> 00:11:12.818]  That's what a lot of what January 6th is all about.
[00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:25.384]  The attempts to sort of weaponize the legal process to completely control the population to make them totally docile, as if we're little bodies inside the Matrix machine in literal life, because that's how Britney Spears has been.
[00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:29.886]  She's been treated like one of those little feeding machines of human beings in the Matrix.
[00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:37.006]  The information and evidence he presented is information and evidence that basically exposes that for what it is.
[00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:38.467]  Of note, the L.A.
[00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:45.971]  court system, because that information was public, because it was put on audio, because it was recorded and broadcast to the world, the L.A.
[00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:52.054]  court system is now prohibiting anyone from even listening to any court proceeding at all in L.A.
[00:11:52.114 --> 00:11:52.394]  County.
[00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:53.975]  So that's the court's response.
[00:11:54.515 --> 00:12:02.357]  The court system's response, the judiciary's response, has been to completely suppress, completely silence the public's ability to know what's going on.
[00:12:02.437 --> 00:12:06.019]  Not only in that case, but in any case pending in LA County.
[00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:14.982]  And even though constitutionally we are all entitled to public access to the courts, both under the state constitution and the federal constitution, depending on the situation,
[00:12:15.462 --> 00:12:23.326]  And in here, they're ignoring all of that by denying the ability to have access to it because of how impactful and how revelatory her words were.
[00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:36.652]  It shocked most people to discover this could happen not only in modern day America, like the I Care A Lot movie for real happening to Britney Spears, but could happen at such a scale that it could be a threat to all of us.
[00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:38.753]  And to give you an example, in the I Care A Lot movie,
[00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:48.840]  The theme of it is that you look at the pharmacy companies profiting from this, the doctors profiting from this, the clinics profiting from this, the lawyers profiting from this, the politicians profiting from this.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.183]  That's what they want to use the sort of whole scale of what lockdown logic is all about.
[00:12:54.223 --> 00:12:59.967]  It's about continuing it, extending it, just coming up with a new excuse for it to completely control you as a human being.
[00:13:00.407 --> 00:13:01.927]  And Robert, let's slow down.
[00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:06.048]  I'm not an award-winning lawyer like you are, but I've studied common law and just basic history.
[00:13:06.608 --> 00:13:10.309]  They use emergencies throughout history to suspend everybody's basic rights.
[00:13:10.969 --> 00:13:12.489]  They declare us wards of the state.
[00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:13.549]  We're all contagious.
[00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:14.929]  We're all disease factories.
[00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.470]  So now we're these little problems that they're going to mitigate and handle.
[00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.450]  Now they own us.
[00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.871]  And so we see, through Britney Spears, a microcosm of L.A.
[00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:29.092]  and the predatory Hollywood system, a la Jeffrey Epstein and, you know, all the rest of the things we've seen.
[00:13:29.972 --> 00:13:39.580]  Well, the other Hollywood types and the sexual abuse, we realize that the cult happening in Hollywood has now been externalized and projected against all of us.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.985]  And we see how we're being declared wards of the state as incompetence to be managed by these very lawyers.
[00:13:46.045 --> 00:13:48.748]  And it really is nothing against the law itself or lawyers.
[00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:53.832]  It is these rackets of criminals coming in, taking over the law.
[00:13:54.412 --> 00:14:00.382]  And affecting this system of making us wards of the state, it'll be through the law and just action we remedy that.
[00:14:00.442 --> 00:14:00.882]  Is that correct?
[00:14:02.268 --> 00:14:02.709]  Absolutely.
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.850]  It's a combination.
[00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.712]  The court of public opinion can ultimately impact the courts of law.
[00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:09.273]  And both have to work together.
[00:14:09.493 --> 00:14:15.718]  Because like in the film, I Care A Lot, this criminal comes up with this genius idea, but it's really what the system is trying to do.
[00:14:16.098 --> 00:14:25.205]  Where it's like, let's create a monopoly where we control all guardianships, where we control all populations, where we control all medicines, we control all clinics, we control everything about it.
[00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:29.948]  That's effectively what Bill Gates has been trying to do for a dozen years, using as a pretext pandemics.
[00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:36.889]  I mean, he's been open and public about his belief that a pandemic will come about and how that will justify his power grab.
[00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:50.272]  And so the only way to resist that is by reasserting our constitutional rights and liberties, both in the court of public opinion on behalf of the Britney Spears in the world, but also inside the courts of law as well, whether that's at the legislative branch, the executive branch, or the judicial branch.
[00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:54.473]  But only public action through the court of public opinion is going to make that actionable and happen.
[00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:59.076]  Self-education is self-empowerment.
[00:14:59.477 --> 00:15:01.418]  Educating others is empowering others.
[00:15:01.698 --> 00:15:07.102]  And that is the first, critical, essential, fundamental step to stopping this massive power grab and the Great Reset.
[00:15:07.182 --> 00:15:08.243]  So what do we do first?
[00:15:08.363 --> 00:15:15.849]  Admit that there's an elite, they're out of control, they've broken the social contract, and then we set about defining the social contract and bringing it back?
[00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:17.906]  Absolutely.
[00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:24.990]  I mean, first it's to expose what these people are up to, expose how it's wrong and illicit, and then fight back by every means possible and practicable.
[00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:35.456]  And so you see it like, for example, a lot of people thought Elon Musk might be this sort of icon of challenging the system, but what people didn't realize, Elon Musk is deeply invested in China, has been for quite some time.
[00:15:35.516 --> 00:15:43.401]  Because of his long-standing investments, they want to use the, all these billionaire elites, want to use the Chinese social credit model system, just like they use the China lockdown system,
[00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:50.332]  Just like the LA Courts used the Britney Spears guardianship example as an example for the rest of us.
[00:15:50.472 --> 00:15:51.975]  This is the model that they're going on.
[00:15:51.995 --> 00:15:55.721]  The first step is to expose it, and the second step is to fight back.
[00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:56.734]  That's right.
[00:15:56.754 --> 00:15:59.295]  This is a modern takeover, not like old wars.
[00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:00.036]  This is a new war.
[00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:01.356]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:02.637]  Thanks for joining us on July 5th.

[00:16:57.436 --> 00:17:01.678]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at Infolwarestore.com.
[00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:17.883]  I came up with this idea a few weeks ago, I guess about a month ago, but we had a snafu getting this because we've been using the same bumper sticker company for about 15 years and I had an idea of Rainstorm and I said, I want these bumper stickers made.
[00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:22.148]  I'm going to sell them at cost in this bumper sticker activist pack to get the word out.
[00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:22.869]  And here they are.
[00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:24.330]  Going into space!
[00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:24.930]  Mathematics!
[00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.871]  Quantum mechanics!
[00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.752]  The secrets of the universe!
[00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:28.572]  It's all there!
[00:17:28.612 --> 00:17:29.052]  Life is fiery!
[00:17:50.324 --> 00:17:52.044]  Do you see this bumper sticker if you're a TV viewer?
[00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.565]  Notice it looks a little different.
[00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:54.685]  It's printed a little bit different.
[00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:57.405]  It's a front peeler, not a back peeler, and all the others aren't.
[00:17:58.225 --> 00:18:01.486]  And we always have high-quality stuff, so these stickers are better than this one.
[00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:01.966]  You notice that?
[00:18:02.386 --> 00:18:06.387]  We have a high-quality supplier with, you know, the best, thickest, best, stickiest ones that last the longest.
[00:18:06.427 --> 00:18:08.047]  But these are high-end bumper stickers.
[00:18:08.067 --> 00:18:09.547]  This is a piece of junk.
[00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:10.187]  But you know what?
[00:18:10.287 --> 00:18:14.388]  It has more value than all these, because the place that did it just got my business.
[00:18:14.408 --> 00:18:17.529]  I'm gonna try to get them to upgrade their printing, because they are for free speech.
[00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:19.029]  It went all the way to the owner of the company,
[00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:29.598]  And the company we've used for 15 years said we will not print masks are for slaves and criminals because they had the people in there on their floor wearing masks and they thought I was insulting them calling them slaves.
[00:18:30.199 --> 00:18:32.901]  Isn't that the perfect microcosm of Stockholm Syndrome?
[00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:38.066]  You're being enslaved by the UN, a global medical cartel, Fauci and Gates that want you dead on record.
[00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:40.607]  They're doing all of this, and then you see a bumper sticker.
[00:18:40.627 --> 00:18:46.010]  They told us about a third of their crew threatened to quit because they thought they were being called slaves because they were wearing masks.
[00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.131]  Well, you are a slave.
[00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.692]  You've been bullied into wearing a mask that doesn't protect you.
[00:18:49.932 --> 00:18:50.493]  It's a cult.
[00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:51.934]  You're muzzled.
[00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:55.836]  Hell, they've got laws against muzzling prisoners federally and at the state level.
[00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:57.797]  Unless they're spitting and biting people, you can't do that.
[00:18:58.057 --> 00:19:00.798]  There's laws you can't do it to people on death row.
[00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:04.180]  So I'm saying, masks are for criminals covering their face and slaves.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.141]  They wouldn't print it.
[00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.342]  Oh, well, how about this then?
[00:19:06.442 --> 00:19:06.922]  Chains?
[00:19:07.242 --> 00:19:07.942]  Are for slaves?
[00:19:07.962 --> 00:19:08.642]  How about that?
[00:19:08.662 --> 00:19:12.243]  And if you were wearing chains, would you get mad at me and say, well, he's calling me a slave!
[00:19:12.523 --> 00:19:13.563]  Yeah, you've been enslaved!
[00:19:13.783 --> 00:19:14.483]  You're a captain!
[00:19:14.503 --> 00:19:15.283]  You're wearing chains!
[00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.544]  Just like wearing a gag!
[00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:19.304]  Just like wearing a face covering to dehumanize you!
[00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:23.685]  So you can find the sticker pack at infowarestore.com, and we're selling them at cost.
[00:19:23.785 --> 00:19:28.006]  By the way, you can get all these stickers for $9.95 with in-game at the same price.
[00:19:28.026 --> 00:19:30.946]  You get in-game for $9.95 to film, you get all the stickers with that order.
[00:20:04.856 --> 00:20:10.741]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:26.700]  Well, I read hundreds of articles a day.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.522]  I scan over probably 500 a day.
[00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:29.642]  I look at countless clips.
[00:20:30.323 --> 00:20:35.527]  I'm up, you know, 18 hours a day researching, and you can't fake knowledge with me.
[00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.089]  Well, Robert Barnes is a super smart guy, and he's here with us.
[00:20:39.109 --> 00:20:43.252]  Couldn't think of a better guest to have on in the first day after July 4th.
[00:20:44.013 --> 00:20:48.016]  And I want to get his take on, because he's practiced a lot of law in Los Angeles.
[00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:49.437]  He knows a lot of the inside baseball.
[00:20:49.797 --> 00:20:50.658]  So I know folks that know him.
[00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:53.961]  And you know that Barnes does have the inside baseball.
[00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:56.010]  So I've had a shot at kind of looking at it as well.
[00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.853]  It's very disgusting.
[00:20:57.935 --> 00:20:59.796]  That it's all about cult programming.
[00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:04.539]  It's about how can you influence people in your personal life, people in business, but also on a mass level.
[00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:08.662]  And so now we have Jeffrey Epstein's 8,000-acre Zorro Ranch.
[00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:11.383]  It's been listed for $27.5 million.
[00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:20.849]  We've got a federal judge saying and other judges saying you got to release the Ghislaine Maxwell documents with the Clintons and this whole blackmail ring.
[00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.033]  So I really see Hollywood and the whole Davos Group globalist system in trouble
[00:21:27.316 --> 00:21:32.899]  I see them launching the lockdown mentality and the control out of a defense mechanism.
[00:21:32.919 --> 00:21:41.843]  We knew they had these plans on the books of lockdowns down the road, but it looks like out of fear against populist revolutions they launched this.
[00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:43.004]  A. Do you agree with that, Barnes?
[00:21:43.484 --> 00:21:44.805]  In the eight minutes we have left of this segment.
[00:21:44.885 --> 00:21:47.787]  And then B. Lay out the Hollywood mentality, this cult.
[00:21:48.247 --> 00:21:53.569]  Is Hollywood really dying or is it actually in its death throes metastasizing and taking over the planet?
[00:21:53.609 --> 00:21:54.390]  Give us the latest on
[00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:01.358]  Epstein, Weinstein, next segment we'll do your take on Bill Cosby here with Robert Barnes.
[00:22:02.952 --> 00:22:05.713]  Yeah, so I mean, I think at multiple levels of what's taking place.
[00:22:05.773 --> 00:22:15.295]  I mean, the untold story of the entire Epstein dynamic was his belief in eugenics, his connection to billionaires and scientists that were pursuing eugenics, all of that.
[00:22:15.755 --> 00:22:26.057]  And so that that aspect was really Bill Gates's particular interest and how that tied into the various, they don't see people as human beings, they see people fundamentally as chattel.
[00:22:27.108 --> 00:22:30.930]  And consequently, how could the Britney Spears case even happen?
[00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:37.454]  It could only happen because you had a court system that saw a human being as property rather than someone with rights vested in an interest.
[00:22:37.974 --> 00:22:42.196]  And that's how the system got corrosively corrupted, and it's not a coincidence it took place in LA.
[00:22:42.556 --> 00:22:51.461]  Now, there's many people who wonder what Britney Spears' information may have been or may be, given that she has been denied meaningful access to her own psychologist
[00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:57.246]  To publicize information that she may know about, that she witnessed as a young girl coming up in the Hollywood system.
[00:22:57.607 --> 00:23:04.773]  It's a system, I mean, Facebook is being sued right now in Texas because of their history of facilitating the grooming of minor children.
[00:23:05.034 --> 00:23:12.681]  They were monetizing minor children's information and then selling that information to people who wanted to groom them for purposes of human trafficking.
[00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:19.846]  So, I mean, that's the kind of activity Big Tech has been involved in, and it's not a coincidence Big Tech is rooted and based in California itself.
[00:23:20.186 --> 00:23:24.709]  We see the same pattern evident in how the aspects of the L.A.
[00:23:24.749 --> 00:23:25.550]  subculture has worked.
[00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:32.895]  I remember over a decade ago, I was at a Kentucky Derby party with some people who worked for Harvey Weinstein, and they were fleeing, and fleeing to Oregon.
[00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:37.636]  And I was wondering, well, why are they so eager to get out of working for Harvey Weinstein?
[00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:42.057]  And there were hints and suggestions about the nature of what working for him was and who he was.
[00:23:42.417 --> 00:23:44.537]  The system knew about that, but it covered it up.
[00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:50.759]  I mean, we go back to the most famous assassinations that occurred or high-profile crimes that occurred.
[00:23:51.019 --> 00:23:55.040]  The assassination of Bobby Kennedy in 1968, then the Charlie Manton events in 1969.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:03.043]  Both handled by LA, both handled in very questionable manners, both of which had potential intelligence apparatus connections to it.
[00:24:03.363 --> 00:24:18.409]  Whether it was MKUltra mind experimentation involving Manson and that group, that even had correlations and correspondence to aspects of the Son and Sam murders of New York some decade later or thereabouts, but also what happened in the Bobby Kennedy assassination, who was involved and who helped cover it up.
[00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:21.811]  So you've got this long, deep-seated corruption in L.A.
[00:24:22.091 --> 00:24:35.821]  that is the source of Hollywood culture, that is the source in many parts of California of big tech, and these two industries have come together for an Epstein-like vision of the world, in which they don't really recognize and respect human rights for human rights.
[00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:37.682]  They want power for their own sake.
[00:24:37.702 --> 00:24:44.705]  They want to monopolize it and aggregate it to themselves, for which the way in which they have controlled Britney Spears is a warning sign to the rest of us.
[00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:54.409]  Because if they can do that to her, you can guarantee they can and will do it to us unless we push back and fight back by every means and manner possible and practicable and achievable.
[00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.230]  And so the subculture of Hollywood is still very strong.
[00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.092]  So aspects of it have been exposed.
[00:25:00.312 --> 00:25:00.912]  Aspects of it
[00:25:01.552 --> 00:25:08.555]  They've been willing to sacrifice as sacrificial lambs, but the deeper truth of the darker truth of what is present has not been exposed.
[00:25:08.835 --> 00:25:11.836]  Some of the biggest institutional actors have not been exposed.
[00:25:12.176 --> 00:25:16.638]  Some of the corrosive corruption of the entire culture has still not been exposed.
[00:25:16.978 --> 00:25:27.322]  Someone like Britney Spears may have some of the information to expose it, but they've prevented her from having her own doctor, her own psychologist, her own therapist, her own counselor for the last dozen plus years.
[00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:30.104]  And so who knows what's taking place in that context?
[00:25:30.465 --> 00:25:38.392]  You dig into aspects of MKUltra and you'll find psychologists who magically show up in every case from Saran Saran to Jack Ruby.
[00:25:38.732 --> 00:25:43.597]  You know, how is it the same person that ended up on an MKUltra payroll ended up in both of those cases?
[00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:54.065]  And it will be very interesting to look at who it is that was being ordered to be the psychologist for Britney Spears against her interest and against her willingness and against her request.
[00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:57.407]  The same pattern has a history, and it's important and relevant.
[00:25:57.427 --> 00:25:59.209]  As you know, you don't have to be a lawyer.
[00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:11.438]  You just have to know history to know the risks and know the problems and know where the paths might be to uncovering and discovering the truth about this, both in terms of what has happened, but also in terms of what is likely to happen.
[00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:31.585]  Well, Barnes, expanding on that, I mean, if you look at the corruption and power of fame, and then Hollywood and money for now almost a hundred years, and you look at what they're projecting on a society, it is psychotic, it is degenerate, it is insane, and you have all these former Disney stars
[00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:39.225]  Connected to Ghislaine Maxwell and all these Disney directors that have raped children who are given jobs again.
[00:26:39.686 --> 00:26:43.949]  I mean, this is really a sick group of people out of control.
[00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.731]  As Lord Acton said, power corrupts.
[00:26:46.312 --> 00:26:47.933]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:50.516]  Or nothing corrupts like power.
[00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:51.797]  Here we are.
[00:26:52.297 --> 00:26:55.100]  So where would you say, is Hollywood in death throes?
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.062]  Or is it metastasizing?
[00:26:57.162 --> 00:26:58.323]  Or a mix of both?
[00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:06.279]  Hollywood still has great influence, and the subculture of it is just getting worse in many respects.
[00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:12.342]  It's just aspects of its worst abusers have been outed and exposed, but they haven't been willing to go deeper.
[00:27:12.943 --> 00:27:28.412]  And, in fact, when you get into sort of what Hollywood subculture is, just look at, you know, whether you're talking about UN activities, whether you're talking about other war zone regions where there was massive child trafficking taking place, connections to the Clinton Foundation, people, personnel who ended up being involved in this.
[00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:33.317]  We've seen many so-called advocates actually be people who are involved in it.
[00:27:33.698 --> 00:27:37.600]  So the deep institutional problems are still completely present.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.563]  There has not been a complete cleansing and purging of the problem in the Hollywood culture.
[00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:44.424]  So let me ask you this.
[00:27:44.524 --> 00:27:45.224]  What is this?
[00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:47.306]  Yeah, they tried to divert off into me too.
[00:27:48.446 --> 00:27:49.968]  No, their issue is pedophilia and rape.
[00:27:50.788 --> 00:27:54.672]  So, what is their major... Is this an offense right now?
[00:27:55.052 --> 00:27:57.995]  With this whole takeover of society, all the leftist garbage?
[00:27:58.015 --> 00:27:59.597]  I mean, what is Hollywood doing right now?
[00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:07.553]  Well the core problem with it, the reason why Hollywood is still bad is because Hollywood still doesn't value human beings as human beings.
[00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:09.775]  That's a common theme in all of this.
[00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:11.998]  Whether we're talking about Britney Spears, we're talking about The Lost Caverns.
[00:28:12.018 --> 00:28:19.086]  So the whole system is we're slaves, we're puppets, we're minions, they give the words to, they're the gods, we're disposable.
[00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:21.194]  Absolutely.
[00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:24.155]  They would like us to be like those machines in the Matrix.
[00:28:24.676 --> 00:28:26.917]  I mean, to just be feeding and providing for them.
[00:28:27.357 --> 00:28:31.860]  And that's how they have a deep lack of respect for humanity as humanity.
[00:28:32.341 --> 00:28:36.083]  So Hollywood is a fundamentally sociopathic or psychopathic institution?
[00:28:37.752 --> 00:28:40.134]  Fundamentally a psychopathic institution.
[00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:45.077]  All right, let's talk about that on the other side with Robert Barnes, great lawyer and a great historian.
[00:28:45.617 --> 00:28:46.978]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.799]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:54.262]  We wouldn't be on air in the year 2021, already on July 5th, if it wasn't for you.
[00:28:54.302 --> 00:28:57.704]  So remember, InfoWars literally is your baby.
[00:28:58.084 --> 00:28:59.185]  Thanks for keeping it alive.
[00:28:59.225 --> 00:29:00.866]  We'll be back with Robert Barnes.
[00:29:06.207 --> 00:29:15.178]  Infowars has proven that we know what we're talking about and that we are a major game-changing organization for a pro-human future.
[00:29:16.112 --> 00:29:21.978]  And I really appreciate the listeners in the last 27 years that have helped me stay on the air.
[00:29:22.718 --> 00:29:40.696]  But now more than ever, being one of the only independent media organizations on the planet that actually understands what we're facing, and now as our prominence and now as people's respect for us really grows to all-time highs, it's more important now than ever that we stay on air to continue to challenge the globalist plague.
[00:29:40.896 --> 00:29:42.937]  Our mission now is more important than ever.
[00:29:43.057 --> 00:29:48.559]  Our importance is more central than ever, and that means your importance, and the guests, and the family that is in full war.
[00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:51.360]  So, I want to thank the listeners for their support and their prayers.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:30:00.823]  But because of the lockdowns of the last year and the supply chain breakdowns, because we sell high-quality supplements as one of our main funding mechanisms, we're unable to get a lot of these products in.
[00:30:00.983 --> 00:30:04.865]  So, we've got to substitute some of those sales with t-shirt sales and water filter sales.
[00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:05.665]  I don't
[00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.052]  We hope you'll get it from us so we can stay on air.
[00:30:24.192 --> 00:30:28.716]  So please, so we can go to the border, and so we can go to all of the country and all the world and cover Bilderberg Grove.
[00:30:28.756 --> 00:30:30.697]  And I want to go cover Bohemian Grove again this year.
[00:30:30.897 --> 00:30:34.500]  So we can do that, I need you to be our sponsor and support us.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.063]  And you do that by going to infowarscore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:45.148]  If you go to the front page of InfoWarsTore.com, right there in the middle, you can see where it says, Become a Sponsor.
[00:30:45.288 --> 00:30:45.868]  That's what it is.
[00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:46.649]  Give a gift.
[00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:47.510]  A one-time gift.
[00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:48.770]  Sign up for recurring gifts.

[00:30:51.272 --> 00:30:58.656]  We really need that because that is 95% of the money coming in from a donation actually funds us instead of a product.
[00:30:58.716 --> 00:31:00.658]  Remember, we make 30, 40% on it.
[00:31:00.718 --> 00:31:02.539]  When it's on sale sometimes, even less.
[00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:11.688]  We bring in tens of millions of dollars, we only have millions to operate with, and running our own infrastructure, our own crews, our own reporters, our own legal, facing the globalist attack, we can't do it without you.

[00:32:07.675 --> 00:32:09.477]  So please, help keep us in the black.
[00:32:09.837 --> 00:32:11.459]  Help keep us out at the tip of the spear.
[00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:14.301]  Because when you finance us, it's like buying war bonds.
[00:32:14.661 --> 00:32:19.606]  You literally are funding the organization that Ryan Stelter and George Soros and others completely hate.
[00:32:19.746 --> 00:32:20.727]  So please, keep us on air.
[00:33:05.737 --> 00:33:11.679]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.203 --> 00:33:27.085]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.043 --> 00:33:35.566]  All right, well, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week said that Bill Cosby goes free.
[00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:42.570]  We've got constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes here with us to respond to that on air on this July 5th transmission.
[00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.951]  Barnes, is that a good ruling, a bad ruling?
[00:33:44.971 --> 00:33:45.772]  What really happened there?
[00:33:46.977 --> 00:33:48.938]  Well, it was an incredibly politicized process.
[00:33:48.999 --> 00:34:07.452]  Whatever people think about Bill Cosby, the reality is that what you had was the prosecutor who did the deal, told Bill Cosby, I'm not going to indict you, made it public, forced Bill Cosby to testify against his own interests without being able to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil trial.
[00:34:07.833 --> 00:34:10.855]  Then that evidence was used against him in the criminal prosecution.
[00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:16.743]  Because the successor prosecutor refused to recognize the public promise made by the former prosecutor.
[00:34:17.124 --> 00:34:26.077]  And the big key to this case is the judge presiding over the trial was a prior political adversary of the prosecutor who had cut the deal with Cosby.
[00:34:26.517 --> 00:34:29.479]  So this judge allowed all kinds of crazy things to take place.
[00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:40.084]  Not only did he allow the prosecution to take place, despite the Fifth Amendment violation even occurring, he also allowed the evidence from the deposition to be used against Cosby in the trial.
[00:34:40.584 --> 00:34:43.505]  On top of that, he allowed five other people to come forward.
[00:34:43.745 --> 00:34:49.288]  After the first case had a mistrial, he allowed five other women to come forward whose allegations could not be confirmed.
[00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:50.548]  We're good to go.
[00:35:19.653 --> 00:35:26.257]  Well, all I know is, is that people are so vitriolic about Bill Cosby, and I don't have a dog in that fight.
[00:35:27.438 --> 00:35:31.461]  But at the same time, the old saying, in fact, who first said that?
[00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:35.263]  Better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison.
[00:35:35.683 --> 00:35:39.226]  If they violated the law and the rules and lied, and I mean,
[00:35:40.515 --> 00:35:45.461]  Out-of-control prosecutors, as we've seen lately, are more dangerous than a criminal.
[00:35:45.621 --> 00:35:48.444]  I mean, what is that precept in law?
[00:35:48.644 --> 00:35:49.385]  Where does that come from?
[00:35:49.405 --> 00:35:50.607]  Because it makes sense to me.
[00:35:51.878 --> 00:35:52.759]  It comes from our founders.
[00:35:53.119 --> 00:36:00.163]  The reason why we have a beyond a reasonable doubt standard is because we want to have confidence in the outcome of our criminal justice process.
[00:36:00.603 --> 00:36:05.726]  Because when the state punishes the innocent, that is a much greater risk than failing to punish the guilty.
[00:36:06.087 --> 00:36:08.588]  Particularly when it's ordinary citizens up against the government.
[00:36:08.908 --> 00:36:10.029]  And that's what happened here.
[00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:14.732]  I mean, the other thing here was, if they had a strong case, they wouldn't have had to resort to all these shenanigans.
[00:36:15.132 --> 00:36:20.316]  The reality is the underlying facts of the particular case he was being indicted for were not very strong.
[00:36:20.676 --> 00:36:27.720]  It was by somebody who did not make an initial report, then later made a report at a time they wanted to get money with a civil suit against Cosby.
[00:36:28.181 --> 00:36:37.607]  It was partially to their benefit that the prosecutor allowed the civil suit to go forward with no threat of criminal prosecution, because that's what led to the big cash settlement that individual got.
[00:36:37.907 --> 00:36:41.930]  And then they turned around and lied, figured out they'd actually been lying all along, the prosecutor's office.
[00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:54.115]  By prosecuting him anyway, and then using that information that he had only disclosed because he thought he had no Fifth Amendment right against him at the trial, and then stacking the odds at the trial and rules on evidence, rules on witnesses, rules on jurors.
[00:36:54.415 --> 00:37:02.519]  Thomas Mesra, one of the great criminal defense lawyers in American history, called it one of the worst travesties of criminal justice he had ever witnessed or knew about.
[00:37:02.879 --> 00:37:17.405]  So, that's why we have to care more about the honesty and honor of the process when the state comes to take away people's rights, as we are witnessing how abusive it can be, not only in the Trump organization tax cases, but also the January 6th cases.
[00:37:18.877 --> 00:37:23.639]  All right, in closing, I appreciate you joining us on kind of the new year, the day before July.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:32.504]  What is, in the five minutes we have left, Robert Barnes, the state of our union, the Democrats, the deep state, the wars, the open borders?
[00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:37.106]  I mean, how would you quantify in five minutes the state of our union and the state of the world?
[00:37:38.314 --> 00:37:44.837]  The elites want to return to the 1920s, 1930s world, where the state has complete and ultimate power.
[00:37:44.897 --> 00:37:57.163]  Whether it's the communist governments of Russia and the Soviet Union, and the rise of the Soviet Union, whether it's the fascistic governments of Italy, Spain, and Germany, it's the same mindset and mentality of total control over the population.
[00:37:57.483 --> 00:38:01.845]  Through which we're seeing multiple examples at a micro level, and we're seeing it at a macro level.
[00:38:02.085 --> 00:38:05.126]  We're seeing it at a micro level in what they're doing in the January 6th cases.
[00:38:05.586 --> 00:38:09.707]  We're seeing it at a level of what they're doing to a Trump organization.
[00:38:09.727 --> 00:38:11.988]  And by the way, Davos said that five years ago.
[00:38:12.028 --> 00:38:15.729]  They said, we want authoritarian technocrats to replace governments.
[00:38:15.749 --> 00:38:17.690]  They've announced an authoritarian takeover.
[00:38:18.672 --> 00:38:21.414]  Precisely, and we're seeing this even in the economic space as well, of course.
[00:38:21.715 --> 00:38:23.777]  We're seeing it in what's happening in the currency control.
[00:38:23.817 --> 00:38:27.880]  Talk about global digital currency, that would be total control over the population.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:34.686]  We're seeing it in major crises taking place that they're trying to cover up with the reverse repo market as more than a trillion bucks.
[00:38:35.006 --> 00:38:42.573]  Thereabouts, the Fed is bailing people out on a daily, nightly basis because people at the top don't trust one another in terms of what's really happening economically.
[00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:51.079]  We're seeing it in terms of the targeting of the Trump Organization for bogus tax charges, some of the weakest tax charges I've ever seen brought against anybody anywhere.
[00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:57.023]  And we're seeing it in the cases like Britney Spears and of course in the lockdowns and the forced vaccinations.
[00:38:57.424 --> 00:39:08.912]  So that's why I'm looking at bringing a suit within the next week or two against Madison Square Garden on behalf of their employees against the forced vaccinations that they are trying to impose on their population because it's just one small step
[00:39:09.352 --> 00:39:09.813]  We're good to go.
[00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:24.589]  I don't know.
[00:39:44.941 --> 00:39:46.241]  Well, it's power driven.
[00:39:46.381 --> 00:39:47.802]  I mean, these are people that are power driven.
[00:39:48.102 --> 00:39:58.924]  It's like, you know, what unites and ties the Epstein pedophiles of the world to the Bill Gates control freaks of the world is this desire to have complete power and complete control.
[00:39:59.424 --> 00:40:04.425]  And it's a deeply, as you know, it's a deeply psychological notion that cannot be changed.
[00:40:04.765 --> 00:40:08.206]  What can be changed is their ability to exercise that power.
[00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:08.486]  That's right.
[00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.466]  Take the mechanisms away.
[00:40:09.486 --> 00:40:11.107]  And as you said, they're not just sociopaths.
[00:40:11.427 --> 00:40:13.067]  This is a psychotic impetus.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.340]  Completely, completely.
[00:40:15.841 --> 00:40:32.128]  The great genius of what you've talked about for more than a quarter of a century is that you cannot trust people who seek power and successfully obtain it, because it's almost always rooted in the wrong motivations, and you should assume the worst about them rather than the best about them, knowing who and what they're about.
[00:40:32.428 --> 00:40:39.712]  And that's why you have to constantly resist it, constantly push back in the court of public opinion, the court of law, and the court of politics, and the court of everywhere.
[00:40:40.012 --> 00:40:48.654]  You have to do everything you can within your individual capacity to do so, and that's where people supporting things like InfoWars makes that possible and practicable.
[00:40:49.694 --> 00:40:50.195]  Absolutely.
[00:40:50.275 --> 00:40:54.316]  In closing, I appreciate you being our first guest of the day here on July 5th.
[00:40:55.296 --> 00:40:59.817]  Do you have hope for humanity, and how do people find the other shows you do that I know are really good?
[00:41:01.204 --> 00:41:01.604]  Absolutely.
[00:41:01.844 --> 00:41:04.746]  Because the reality is the great schools of learning can never be closed.
[00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:09.608]  That's the archives of nature and the rights of man at their conscience and the world we can see around us.
[00:41:09.888 --> 00:41:14.211]  It's God's fingerprint that he made sure all of us could see and witness.
[00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:17.292]  And if we act upon it, then we can always push back.
[00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:18.973]  And that is the great faith that I have.
[00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:24.996]  And it's a faith that has been shown over thousands of years of the capacity of ordinary people to do extraordinary things.
[00:41:25.857 --> 00:41:34.684]  And people can find me always at VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com and that's where all my content is and where we put up template letters and all the rest.
[00:41:35.305 --> 00:41:38.628]  And you're still on Twitter and other places, I've noticed that, but you don't even promote that anymore.
[00:41:40.124 --> 00:41:43.165]  Yeah, I am, but it's whenever Twitter's going to take me off.
[00:41:43.426 --> 00:41:51.709]  Well, I'm still there at Barnes underscore Law for the time being, but Twitter has tried to take me off before and I'm sure they'll take me off at some point in the future.
[00:41:51.729 --> 00:41:53.370]  Creating a local page to be separate.
[00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.910]  Absolutely.
[00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.471]  That's a great show you do without a Canadian lawyer.
[00:41:56.951 --> 00:42:05.055]  The minute you file that Madison Square Garden lawsuit, please let me know because that is a really important thing.
[00:42:05.095 --> 00:42:05.855]  Robert Barnes, thank you.
[00:42:06.963 --> 00:42:07.703]  Absolutely, glad to be here.
[00:42:08.364 --> 00:42:12.586]  All right, there goes Robert Barnes on this July 5th broadcast.
[00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:17.049]  We're going to go to break and I've got a bunch of news and breaking information we're going to cover.
[00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:33.645]  When we come back, and because it is the day after July 4th, we are going to re-air some interviews so I can get some work done around the office, spend time with family, with Sherry Tenpenny and Mike Adams from last week.
[00:42:34.106 --> 00:42:38.230]  Extremely powerful interviews, but I wanted to come in on the
[00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:46.718]  First day after July 4th and have Robert Barnes on because he has got some really amazing points that he is making.
[00:42:47.238 --> 00:42:50.241]  We've also got some other excerpts of some of the biggest interviews in the last few weeks coming up.
[00:42:50.682 --> 00:42:56.447]  But I'll be back on the other side with more analysis before we get to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:02.698]  And of course, other special guests like Mike Adams who knocked it out of the park last Friday.
[00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.771]  Satellite phones used to be super expensive.
[00:43:20.852 --> 00:43:22.253]  And then the price has gone down quite a bit.
[00:43:22.293 --> 00:43:23.734]  But this is one of the best deals out there.
[00:43:23.814 --> 00:43:27.097]  And then we make a small percentage off every deal you sign up for.
[00:43:27.117 --> 00:43:28.218]  So you get the phone for free.
[00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.179]  A high-end phone.
[00:43:29.219 --> 00:43:29.699]  I looked it up.
[00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:30.660]  It's one of the best out there.
[00:43:31.361 --> 00:43:33.182]  And then it's a year contract.
[00:43:33.262 --> 00:43:35.224]  And then you have the minutes already on the phone.
[00:43:35.805 --> 00:43:37.086]  And if you want to get more minutes, you can do that.
[00:43:37.126 --> 00:43:37.926]  But it's a good deal.
[00:43:38.985 --> 00:43:39.886]  Again, is it the best deal?
[00:43:39.946 --> 00:43:42.428]  It's apples and oranges, but it's right up there as the best deals.
[00:43:42.648 --> 00:43:44.509]  Infowarsphone.com.
[00:43:44.729 --> 00:43:47.191]  And, well, I didn't know that satellite phones had gone down to this price.
[00:43:47.231 --> 00:43:48.192]  I've got one right here.
[00:43:48.372 --> 00:43:50.153]  Again, these are amongst some of the best out there.
[00:43:50.574 --> 00:43:52.275]  A free phone, sign up for a year.
[00:43:52.915 --> 00:43:53.856]  It's like $9.99 a month.
[00:43:54.176 --> 00:43:55.657]  You get all these minutes on a sat phone.
[00:43:55.677 --> 00:43:56.518]  They can't track you.
[00:43:56.538 --> 00:43:57.379]  They can't trace you.
[00:43:57.879 --> 00:43:58.800]  This is next level.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:43:59.800]  And so I've got one.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:00.461]  I'm booting it up.
[00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:01.482]  It's got the controller.
[00:44:01.622 --> 00:44:02.643]  It's got the antennas.
[00:44:02.743 --> 00:44:03.663]  It's got everything.
[00:44:03.783 --> 00:44:05.405]  So, Steve, thanks for recommending this.
[00:44:05.485 --> 00:44:07.306]  And tell us about this sat phone and why it's important.
[00:44:07.346 --> 00:44:15.429]  Well, first of all, Alex, the critical communication with our loved ones, with information sources, that's what this is all about, the sat phones.
[00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:17.750]  Media censorship is happening.
[00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:21.411]  You and I both know that corporations can't be trusted.
[00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:24.852]  Cellular phones are subject to hacking and tracking.
[00:44:25.353 --> 00:44:29.174]  And I said that's why... When they make their big move, they're going to shut off individually-paid smartphones.
[00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:30.950]  Absolutely.
[00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.491]  And I came up with a statement and I stand by it.
[00:44:33.732 --> 00:44:36.714]  They want to track ya, whack ya, and stack ya.
[00:44:37.094 --> 00:44:38.715]  Stack ya is like dead bodies.
[00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:40.697]  Listen, I'm passionate about this.
[00:44:41.197 --> 00:44:44.279]  I have to know that my loved ones are alive.
[00:44:44.639 --> 00:44:54.927]  I have to know that, hey, if I need to call Alex, hey, if there's an operation going, you and I and others who are on talk radio will be shut down selectively at the cell phone level.
[00:44:55.447 --> 00:45:02.016]  Well, that's actually my plan is to set it up with other people that can actually get messages recorded from the phone if I'm in the field and it still gets out.
[00:45:02.076 --> 00:45:05.480]  I mean, we're having to actually look at this, folks, because that's the endgame we're moving into.
[00:45:05.741 --> 00:45:09.065]  We're like, as the collapse of censorship happens, it goes exponential now.
[00:45:09.085 --> 00:45:11.268]  Now look, the world's in a crisis, let's face it.
[00:45:11.688 --> 00:45:18.813]  I want to stay in contact with all my supporters, all my people that have subscribed to my newsletter, but this is what we're also setting up.
[00:45:18.853 --> 00:45:21.215]  From satellite, it'll go to ham radio operators.
[00:45:21.395 --> 00:45:23.136]  All the hams have already been talking to me.
[00:45:23.176 --> 00:45:24.277]  Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[00:45:24.757 --> 00:45:27.800]  And the point is, like you said, this is the best deal.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.442]  By the way, 150 minutes, and they allow you to roll your minutes.
[00:45:31.522 --> 00:45:36.206]  So if you don't use 150 minutes in February, you can use it in March, or March now into April.
[00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:36.786]  I have one.
[00:45:37.126 --> 00:45:44.228]  I sent my wife one of these that saved her sister's life because they were in a really bad situation floating a river.
[00:45:44.588 --> 00:45:49.769]  She got a phone call out to me on her sat phone and I basically had airplanes in the air.
[00:45:49.809 --> 00:45:53.370]  This is the way to not just put the regular phones inside privacy pockets.
[00:45:53.771 --> 00:45:54.431]  This is the way to go.
[00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.031]  And I looked it up.
[00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:56.671]  You're like, okay, you're saying I should go with these people.
[00:45:56.691 --> 00:45:57.492]  You're not making money on all that.
[00:45:57.832 --> 00:45:58.292]  I checked.
[00:45:58.312 --> 00:45:59.072]  This is one of the best deals.
[00:45:59.392 --> 00:46:03.597]  If the other best deals are $600 for a phone, then you still pay for the minutes on a card.
[00:46:03.958 --> 00:46:07.582]  This is free phone, sign up for a year, $99 a month.
[00:46:07.702 --> 00:46:08.624]  It's a great deal.
[00:46:08.724 --> 00:46:13.129]  And then you have these minutes you can roll over and get in the habit, folks, of using a sat phone and explain.
[00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:15.372]  You can call people on regular phones with a sat phone.
[00:46:15.492 --> 00:46:22.498]  Absolutely, and the neat thing is, is anybody who calls you on a sat phone, if they initiate the call, you're not paying for it.
[00:46:22.538 --> 00:46:24.100]  That's what I want people to understand.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.362]  I'm telling you folks, this is an insane deal.
[00:46:26.422 --> 00:46:30.566]  I remember Steer and Steve 10 years ago talking about satellite phones, and I just, I didn't ignore it.
[00:46:30.586 --> 00:46:31.927]  I respect it, and I was like, okay, whatever.
[00:46:32.307 --> 00:46:34.489]  I was like, how do I get the best preparedness products?
[00:46:34.509 --> 00:46:37.190]  I know he's a big, famous, one of the first big survivalists.
[00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.872]  He said, sat phones, Alex, sat phones.
[00:46:38.912 --> 00:46:39.512]  I'll give you the lady.
[00:46:39.572 --> 00:46:41.333]  And then we checked it, and it's one of the best deals out there.
[00:46:41.453 --> 00:46:42.894]  And then this supports the broadcast.
[00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:44.075]  Not much, it's a little bit of money.
[00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:45.336]  But I don't care, folks.
[00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:46.137]  I've got one.
[00:46:46.237 --> 00:46:47.057]  We're starting to use it.
[00:46:47.157 --> 00:46:47.698]  It's incredible.
[00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:48.418]  It's so clear.
[00:46:48.538 --> 00:46:50.960]  And it's crazy that this is a phone that's not watching you.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.502]  This is a phone not listening to you, not sending cookies out, not controlling you.
[00:46:54.742 --> 00:46:56.924]  This is really a free phone.
[00:46:57.124 --> 00:46:59.065]  By free, I mean it's actually in the ether.
[00:46:59.105 --> 00:46:59.426]  It's real.
[00:47:05.655 --> 00:47:09.736]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:10.256 --> 00:47:11.576]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:14.257 --> 00:47:21.158]  Old pirates, yes they rob I. Sold I to the merchant ships.
[00:47:23.439 --> 00:47:30.160]  Minutes after they took I. From the bottomless pits.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.341]  But my hand was made strong.
[00:47:46.752 --> 00:47:50.475]  People ask me constantly, what's it like to be vindicated?
[00:47:51.416 --> 00:47:53.378]  What's it like to trend on Twitter at number one every week?
[00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:54.900]  I could care less.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.643]  What does it mean, like, what I said came true?
[00:47:57.723 --> 00:47:58.724]  It's all in their own documents.
[00:48:00.788 --> 00:48:04.631]  And I sit back and I think about what we're about to go through.
[00:48:04.651 --> 00:48:16.239]  And I just say, hey, they're already kidnapping all these kids, they're already murdering all these innocent people, they're already starving Africa and Latin America and Asia to death and Eastern Europe.
[00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:18.600]  And I just think of those starving children.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:28.567]  I mean, God, I saw a documentary in Africa where the dad's sitting there giving the kids all the food he's got and they're begging and crying for food and they're dying.
[00:48:29.895 --> 00:48:37.519]  You say, well fine, just kill these people, don't give them any food, but the point is, is they're humans too, and if we don't take care of them, nobody's going to take care of us.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:46.763]  And it makes me think about, the globalists don't want to kill all these people, because they want to protect them.
[00:48:47.123 --> 00:48:47.984]  No, they hate them!
[00:48:48.944 --> 00:48:49.964]  And they hate us too!
[00:48:53.166 --> 00:48:57.228]  We're supposed to fix all the problems on this planet, not kill everybody!
[00:48:59.718 --> 00:49:06.882]  While Klaus Schwab wears his little three-piece suits and flies around in his airplanes playing God, the little arrogant bastard.
[00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:19.268]  So... It's hard to come to the realization it's all over.
[00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:27.031]  Because I want to go to the football games, and I want to go to the movies, and I want to go out and eat at five-star restaurants, and I want to have a good time with everybody else.
[00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:28.271]  But let me tell you something.
[00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:31.192]  They're going to make you sell out and take deadly shots.
[00:49:31.592 --> 00:49:32.812]  They're going to make you submit.
[00:49:33.152 --> 00:49:34.993]  They're going to make you grovel to their system.
[00:49:35.253 --> 00:49:39.254]  And they're going to make you sell your soul to have any freedom.
[00:49:39.554 --> 00:49:43.615]  And I tell them, you're going to pay.
[00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:51.652]  Because this is all a test of how much will we put up with?
[00:49:52.413 --> 00:49:55.134]  How much evil will we go along with?
[00:49:55.655 --> 00:50:01.839]  It was liberty and Christ's energy that produced the freedom and produced all the largesse.
[00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:09.023]  It wasn't globalism and Klaus Schwab now telling us that if we dance just the way he says, he'll give us some free goodies.
[00:50:09.243 --> 00:50:10.524]  You guys put a Bible verse back up.
[00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:11.565]  Put it back up there.
[00:50:11.585 --> 00:50:12.405]  I appreciate you putting that up.
[00:50:13.126 --> 00:50:13.506]  I'll cover it.
[00:50:16.118 --> 00:50:29.626]  But who shall offend one of these little ones, which, believe it be, were better for him to a millstone were hanged around his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea.
[00:50:30.106 --> 00:50:32.028]  Matthew 18, 6, that was Jesus Christ.
[00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:36.931]  And it's not just raping a child God doesn't like.
[00:50:38.912 --> 00:50:40.333]  It's lying to a child.
[00:50:40.893 --> 00:50:42.414]  It's teaching children evil.
[00:50:44.167 --> 00:50:45.227]  It's misdirecting them.
[00:50:45.607 --> 00:50:47.068]  It's teaching them to hate themselves.
[00:50:47.488 --> 00:50:49.588]  It's teaching them to serve the system.
[00:50:49.968 --> 00:50:51.669]  It's teaching them to do bad things.
[00:50:52.089 --> 00:51:03.351]  It's teaching them all the things the left wants is to take God's children because those children belong to God.
[00:51:08.412 --> 00:51:11.213]  God made them for their free will.
[00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:21.317]  And when you steal a little child's free will, you steal from God, what God cares about most is free will.
[00:51:22.198 --> 00:51:30.905]  Those little precious creatures, and their big adventure, and their big discovery, and everything they're gonna do, and you get in the way of that, because God doesn't get in the way of it.
[00:51:31.206 --> 00:51:32.647]  God gives us all the free will we want.
[00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:35.149]  But you steal that free will, don't you?
[00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.051]  Because you're a Satanist.
[00:51:38.372 --> 00:51:39.373]  Because you're gonna burn in hell.
[00:51:40.182 --> 00:51:43.723]  You know, I was going to air this special report, but if I don't talk about this, we won't be here.
[00:51:47.145 --> 00:51:51.626]  And so, I'm just going to do this now, and I guess the next segment will air Greg Reese's new incredible report.
[00:51:52.326 --> 00:51:59.049]  There's the 10 stages of genocide, and then we've got all the big guests coming up, and all everything else we're going to cover today.
[00:51:59.069 --> 00:52:06.752]  But I'm just going to separately tell you, I sell products you need, I promote things you need, and
[00:52:08.513 --> 00:52:09.533]  If you buy them, you buy them.
[00:52:09.553 --> 00:52:10.674]  We stay on air, you don't.
[00:52:11.134 --> 00:52:17.357]  And the good thing was, we were fully funded last year, but then the lockdown killed all our suppliers.
[00:52:17.937 --> 00:52:24.940]  That's why you go to grocery stores around the country and half the stuff you want is even in stock or it's some little shriveled package of crap and all the rest of it.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:30.282]  So I would just say, while you still can, I will get an InfowarsStore.com t-shirt.
[00:52:30.782 --> 00:52:33.804]  I'd get a book, I'd get a film, I'd get a supplement.
[00:52:34.904 --> 00:52:36.625]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine is amazing.
[00:52:36.965 --> 00:52:40.667]  X3 won't get more in for 8 weeks to 12 weeks, they're telling me.
[00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:46.970]  It's about to sell out by Monday because I'm selling it for basically at cost with free shipping and all the rest of it at 60% off.
[00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:49.151]  And we got X2 50% off.
[00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:51.072]  At least with that, we make like $10 at least.
[00:52:51.552 --> 00:52:52.652]  That's an amazing thing.
[00:52:52.692 --> 00:52:53.333]  I would get that.
[00:52:54.133 --> 00:52:55.894]  And we got a lot of other products there on the side.
[00:52:55.934 --> 00:52:59.956]  Vazo Beats, which creates... What does it create?
[00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:00.356]  It creates...
[00:53:02.912 --> 00:53:05.914]  What's the thing dentists give you when you go to the dentist?
[00:53:06.274 --> 00:53:06.934]  Laughing gas.
[00:53:07.455 --> 00:53:09.396]  It creates that in your blood, which is really good for your heart.
[00:53:10.557 --> 00:53:11.197]  Nitrous Oxide.
[00:53:12.278 --> 00:53:22.504]  And we also got Turbo Force, Shannara Clean Energy, 40% off Alpha Power, 40% off Vazzo Beats, 50% off Apollo Block, 40% off Torvato Shield X2, 50% off X3, 60% off.
[00:53:23.004 --> 00:53:23.805]  All of it free shipping.
[00:53:24.305 --> 00:53:25.125]  Hello, Patriot Points.
[00:53:26.482 --> 00:53:37.445]  You know, that gives us the money to buy the products into the future, even though now with this, and I'm not bitching, I'm just warning you about the economy, because used to we had where
[00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:40.865]  Once they're going to ship us the product, we had to pay half.
[00:53:41.165 --> 00:53:48.974]  Because the breakdown of the economy, all of our people are like, 100% up front, or 50% before we ship, because they killed confidence.
[00:53:49.274 --> 00:53:50.456]  They broke the economy up.
[00:53:51.076 --> 00:53:51.877]  They screwed it over.
[00:53:51.897 --> 00:53:53.779]  They're like, hey, I'm not bitching.
[00:53:53.799 --> 00:53:55.461]  At least we got food to eat here in America.
[00:53:55.782 --> 00:53:57.323]  The third world, they're starving to death, folks.
[00:53:58.342 --> 00:53:59.103]  Klaus Schwab did that.
[00:53:59.143 --> 00:53:59.803]  Bill Gates did that.
[00:53:59.823 --> 00:54:04.046]  I mean, like, some guy walks up to me in the street, punches me in the nose, I'm gonna beat their ass.
[00:54:04.646 --> 00:54:06.807]  Oh, but Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates do it to all of us.
[00:54:07.068 --> 00:54:13.331]  We just sit there and we take it, because they're the big man up there on that mountaintop, and I'm not even calling for violence against them.
[00:54:13.391 --> 00:54:15.693]  It's just, I'm a businessman.
[00:54:16.033 --> 00:54:16.854]  I know how stuff works.
[00:54:17.314 --> 00:54:18.695]  I've got to run my own operations.
[00:54:18.975 --> 00:54:26.580]  And I see that guy, what he did, is literally almost shutting us down, and then he's killing people all over the world!
[00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:31.433]  And as a man, I can't take that.
[00:54:31.453 --> 00:54:38.543]  I'm not gonna go after Klaus Schwab and turn him into a victim.
[00:54:39.444 --> 00:54:43.790]  I just pray to God, bring justice against Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, in the name of Jesus.
[00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:44.732]  Please, God, help us.
[00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:56.586]  And God says, what did you do all these other years, everything else?
[00:54:57.347 --> 00:54:58.908]  God says, I sent Klaus Schwab.
[00:54:59.188 --> 00:55:03.131]  You know, he's a monster to destroy everybody, because it's what you wanted.
[00:55:03.952 --> 00:55:05.193]  You wanted to kill babies.
[00:55:05.533 --> 00:55:06.654]  You wanted to love the devil.
[00:55:07.294 --> 00:55:09.896]  So I sent what you wanted, and here he is!
[00:55:11.077 --> 00:55:13.299]  And see, that's how God works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:14.279 --> 00:55:15.160]  You want a devil?
[00:55:16.341 --> 00:55:17.281]  You're going to get one.
[00:55:18.883 --> 00:55:19.923]  You want to get destroyed?
[00:55:21.064 --> 00:55:21.865]  God will give you one.
[00:55:23.012 --> 00:55:24.453]  You want Satan to kill your ass?
[00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:26.274]  God'll give you what you want.
[00:55:26.334 --> 00:55:26.894]  You got free will.
[00:55:30.096 --> 00:55:31.557]  But I know God hears our cries.
[00:55:32.597 --> 00:55:36.079]  And God hears the cries of all the children starving to death.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.923]  15 million extra in the last year because of the UN lockdown that's on Klaus Schwab and on Bill Gates' soul.
[00:55:42.343 --> 00:55:44.544]  And if we don't stand up and speak out against it, it's on us.
[00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.685]  Do you want those dead children on your soul?
[00:55:47.406 --> 00:55:49.487]  Because I can feel God's anger.
[00:55:51.769 --> 00:55:53.010]  You want God against you?
[00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:55.372]  I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:55:55.392 --> 00:55:57.593]  I don't know what to do.
[00:55:58.374 --> 00:56:01.617]  I'm just telling you, God's really pissed off right now.
[00:56:01.637 --> 00:56:08.262]  I mean, you get mad at Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab, but those are the devils we bow down to.
[00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:11.184]  They're the devils we open the door up to.
[00:56:15.727 --> 00:56:16.288]  We did that.
[00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.511]  We turned them loose.
[00:56:22.657 --> 00:56:23.378]  We opened the door.
[00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:27.483]  And now we're gonna hurt.
[00:56:29.326 --> 00:56:31.028]  Because God's a fair God.
[00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.693]  And what we did to these children, we're gonna pay for now.
[00:56:37.853 --> 00:56:39.614]  I had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on last week.
[00:56:39.634 --> 00:56:40.295]  It was incredible.
[00:56:40.695 --> 00:56:41.896]  Mark Adams knocked her out of the park.
[00:56:42.537 --> 00:56:46.740]  So on this July 5th transmission, we're going to air both those interviews coming up.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:52.965]  But I wanted to come on today before that aired and just tell you how much I love you and how much I appreciate you.
[00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:54.446]  Because look, I'm not guilting you.
[00:56:54.746 --> 00:56:55.687]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:56:56.267 --> 00:56:57.308]  I'm in the same boat as you.
[00:56:57.728 --> 00:56:59.610]  I just know I love God and I don't love Satan.
[00:57:03.112 --> 00:57:04.914]  And I'm going to ask you, what are we going to do?
[00:57:05.234 --> 00:57:06.355]  Well, the least we can do
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.001]  Is not care what our neighbors think.
[00:57:10.782 --> 00:57:14.566]  The least we can do is go to our church and stand up at the front and tell them what they're doing.
[00:57:14.906 --> 00:57:16.888]  The least we can do is say no to vaccine passports.
[00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:27.919]  The least we can do, this is the most important thing I've said in years, is challenge everything the mainstream satanic mouthpieces say.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.343]  Everything the system says is death.
[00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:36.871]  We should oppose everything it promotes, everything it does, out of hand.
[00:57:37.552 --> 00:57:37.932]  Say no.
[00:57:38.853 --> 00:57:40.274]  You do that, we gotta shoot.
[00:57:41.034 --> 00:57:41.555]  We gotta shot.
[00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:43.356]  We got a way to beat this.
[00:57:44.177 --> 00:57:45.418]  Alright, great job to the crew!
[00:57:46.198 --> 00:57:48.140]  We're gonna continue on here today.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.762]  I really appreciate you all keeping us on air.
[00:57:51.162 --> 00:57:51.822]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:52.923 --> 00:57:54.825]  It's hard to believe that July 4th, 2021 is almost here.
[00:57:58.715 --> 00:58:02.016]  It's hard to believe that our country is literally fighting for its life.
[00:58:03.136 --> 00:58:07.797]  But for all the negative things that are happening, a lot of really positive things are happening as well.
[00:58:08.437 --> 00:58:13.479]  It's been said by many historians that things have to get really, really bad before they get better.
[00:58:13.959 --> 00:58:16.940]  And we're now reaching that point of no return, that tipping point.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.940]  Global government
[00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:22.091]  And its planetary depopulation plan is now out in the open.
[00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:25.293]  And people realize the time for fun and games is over.
[00:58:25.313 --> 00:58:31.656]  That's why I wanted to report to you, the listeners and viewers of this transmission, the good news today, as well as the bad news.
[00:58:32.317 --> 00:58:43.863]  I've been contacted in the last two weeks by some of the top people in international media and national news as well, as well as some of the folks at the highest levels of government, corporations, the private sector, you name it.
[00:58:44.283 --> 00:58:45.744]  And they've all told me the same thing.
[00:58:46.284 --> 00:58:47.045]  Alex, keep it up.
[00:58:48.032 --> 00:58:48.332]  You think?
[00:59:02.762 --> 00:59:10.648]  World government is attacking, but we have a chance to defeat it because we've worked together for decades to warn people about what was coming.
[00:59:11.028 --> 00:59:11.889]  It sounded insane.
[00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:12.709]  It sounded crazy.
[00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:13.490]  It sounded dangerous.
[00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:14.551]  It sounded made up.
[00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:18.774]  It sounded like a horror movie, a science fiction dystopia, but it was real.
[00:59:19.474 --> 00:59:21.456]  And so we knew it was real, and we knew that we were going to pull this.
[00:59:22.253 --> 00:59:27.756]  And so now that they've actually launched their operation, people aren't being completely caught flat-footed.
[00:59:28.136 --> 00:59:29.877]  So that's the real power of InfoWars.
[00:59:30.437 --> 00:59:32.799]  That's why it's more important than ever to help keep it on air.
[00:59:33.239 --> 00:59:41.323]  We have a July 4th special running right now with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points is back as well, and up to 60% off best-selling items like X3.
[00:59:41.824 --> 00:59:51.589]  So please, take action today and help keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever, because our mission is proving that it's incredibly accurate and has been part of the human destiny for liberty and freedom.
[01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:20.571]  Alright, I'm going to play a few clips.
[01:00:20.591 --> 01:00:25.593]  There's a lot more of these from Trump's little intimate speech he gave at the border wall yesterday.
[01:00:26.073 --> 01:00:26.573]  I was there.
[01:00:27.492 --> 01:00:29.493]  But I saw all the international media there.
[01:00:29.513 --> 01:00:31.474]  I didn't want to try to cause an upset.
[01:00:31.534 --> 01:00:32.515]  I just didn't get out.
[01:00:33.455 --> 01:00:34.016]  But my crew did.
[01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:35.597]  They all got footage of it, the rest of it.
[01:00:35.617 --> 01:00:37.498]  But we were brought in there.
[01:00:37.518 --> 01:00:40.980]  And I just sat back and said, you know, I'm going to let Trump have this moment.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.541]  Because if I went out there again, it would have been a big deal.
[01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:44.342]  Here is the Trump stalker.
[01:00:45.282 --> 01:00:45.983]  Jim Acosta.
[01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:50.587]  You've seen him shout out the questions about January 6th, where Trump should get on the offense.
[01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.388]  Exposes the deep state operation.
[01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:58.753]  And then we'll play Lauren Boebert, who I think is just an awesome member of Congress.
[01:00:59.514 --> 01:01:00.315]  And what she had to say.
[01:01:00.335 --> 01:01:04.098]  We also have Representative Ronnie Jackson and a bunch of other interviews at Band Off Video.
[01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:07.861]  But here is Acosta and Representative Boebert.
[01:01:13.493 --> 01:01:16.677]  Thank you for all of these incredible congressmen that came, and women.
[01:01:17.097 --> 01:01:17.838]  We appreciate it.
[01:01:17.858 --> 01:01:19.000]  Thank you, Lauren, very much.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.780]  I'll see you soon.
[01:01:19.861 --> 01:01:20.201]  Thank you.
[01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.502]  Governor, congratulations.
[01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.383]  So that's that little clip right there.
[01:01:47.984 --> 01:01:52.627]  Guy's got some other great long interviews, but here's the representative.
[01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.147]  Here she is.
[01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.509]  I have a question for the press.
[01:01:55.529 --> 01:01:57.230]  Do you miss President Trump?
[01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:57.991]  I know you do.
[01:01:58.031 --> 01:01:59.051]  You miss him so much.
[01:01:59.111 --> 01:01:59.512]  So much.
[01:02:10.825 --> 01:02:14.887]  Hey, Congresswoman Boebert, have you been down to McAllen where they're actually processing people in and out?
[01:02:14.927 --> 01:02:15.307]  Yes, I have.
[01:02:15.547 --> 01:02:16.147]  What do you think of that?
[01:02:16.187 --> 01:02:19.369]  I've been in the Border Patrol holding facilities, HHS.
[01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:22.991]  I've been down to the temporary outdoor processing facility and then another one last night.
[01:02:23.771 --> 01:02:26.412]  And it's devastating what's taking place there.
[01:02:26.432 --> 01:02:28.233]  It's an absolute humanitarian crisis.
[01:02:28.253 --> 01:02:30.394]  I don't want to hear another darn
[01:02:30.674 --> 01:02:31.415]  I think so.
[01:02:52.458 --> 01:03:07.643]  I don't want to hear another darn thing about Americans having to change their way of life over this stupid China virus ever again because of this dereliction of duty from the president right now is a disaster, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to pour into our country.
[01:03:07.843 --> 01:03:10.404]  And this is not just an Arizona or a Texas problem.
[01:03:10.504 --> 01:03:12.405]  This is a problem for the entire country.
[01:03:12.765 --> 01:03:21.327]  We've been in the McAllen Airport where I've seen dozens of groups of people with their manila envelopes and instructions on how to travel all throughout the country to get to their destinations.
[01:03:21.367 --> 01:03:27.448]  Talking to groups last night, they're going to California, they're going to Philadelphia, they're going to Minneapolis.
[01:03:27.848 --> 01:03:29.589]  These folks are going everywhere.
[01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:35.590]  Colorado is a sanctuary state and our governor has just lessened restrictions on illegal aliens.
[01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:37.291]  All right, thank you.
[01:04:07.688 --> 01:04:11.549]  Well, I'll tell you, Congressman Boebert is absolutely amazing.
[01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:13.750]  Lauren Boebert and then also Lauren Witzki.
[01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:14.510]  I love all these Laurens.
[01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:18.831]  I had a chance to meet her before she was a Congresswoman, right before she got elected at the Virginia rally.
[01:04:19.612 --> 01:04:22.292]  And just a absolute firecracker.
[01:04:22.312 --> 01:04:27.494]  And I would love to see half a Congress or more be women like that.
[01:04:28.373 --> 01:04:35.877]  They can be brown, they can be white, they can be black, they can be coconut colored, long as that pink matter in their head is pro-human.
[01:04:36.097 --> 01:04:38.299]  There's nothing cooler.
[01:04:39.198 --> 01:04:40.179]  And I'll say it's sexier.
[01:04:40.939 --> 01:04:44.441]  You have a good-looking woman that's dumb and just ain't good-looking.
[01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:45.922]  But you had good looks with smarts.
[01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:46.963]  I like it.
[01:04:47.703 --> 01:04:48.303]  I like it a lot.
[01:04:48.364 --> 01:04:49.264]  And my wife likes it too.
[01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:50.765]  She admires women like that.
[01:04:50.785 --> 01:04:51.405]  That's what we need.
[01:04:51.465 --> 01:04:52.886]  I just love empowered women.
[01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:54.647]  Gosh, it makes me excited.
[01:04:55.088 --> 01:04:58.490]  All these dumb liberal women look like a spider sucked their soul out.

[01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:42.994]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we're about to cover is earth-shattering information, and it's what I was already told by medical doctors personally known by me who were scared to come on the show.
[01:06:44.415 --> 01:06:56.306]  But it's also in the mainline medical literature that up until a couple years ago, they would always say pregnant women should not take inoculations, because even if it's a decent vaccine for something real, that's a real science,
[01:06:57.168 --> 01:07:00.990]  It could cause an autoimmune response and you will reject your baby.
[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.952]  So vaccines, until a few years ago, said do not take while pregnant.
[01:07:04.972 --> 01:07:08.673]  In fact, a lot of them still say that on the informational insert.
[01:07:09.534 --> 01:07:20.759]  But because they wanted to stonewall people and say, oh, there's never a problem with regular vaccines, even though they have a secret damage fund and pay out billions a year, and they have damage funds around the world, so this doesn't make it to the news.
[01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:26.516]  Now they've got their mRNA gene therapy that rewrites the DNA.
[01:07:26.536 --> 01:07:28.718]  And they came out yesterday and admitted, okay, it does rewrite your DNA.
[01:07:28.738 --> 01:07:32.902]  It makes your whole body attack proteins that just so happen to be in the placenta.
[01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:44.312]  And what did Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the main advisory EU commission, say in December last year in an emergency filing with Dr. Yidan, the former chief scientist advisor?
[01:07:44.673 --> 01:07:46.995]  This will cause spontaneous abortions.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:54.903]  This will probably cause shedding of viruses that will make women have miscarriages, but also attack women's uterus.
[01:07:56.624 --> 01:07:58.865]  And now it's happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:11.051]  I just read the study that's using mainline federal numbers from the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most prestigious journals in the world.
[01:08:12.728 --> 01:08:15.129]  Depopulation alert, the article's on Infowars.com.
[01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:27.172]  Shocking new study reveals COVID vaccine treatments terminates four out of five pregnancies via spontaneous abortions.
[01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:41.576]  The medical doctor that Rob Dew and I both know said that every woman he knows in his practice, he's an OGBYN, here in Austin, 50-something year old dude, been practicing 20 years,
[01:08:44.093 --> 01:08:49.596]  Every woman in his practice that he told don't do it, went and did it, had a miscarriage.
[01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:58.920]  You know, I might just go up to his office and grab him by the damn hair and drag his ass on this show.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.021]  But he knows, he's not supposed to tell you that, he'll get in trouble, see?
[01:09:03.202 --> 01:09:06.223]  Man, this is sick, but this is the New England Journal of Medicine!
[01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:15.470]  You see, they can't get it authorized for children, even though it's unauthorized, even an emergency authorization.
[01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:16.850]  Their own scientists won't do that.
[01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.631]  They all do, don't do it to kids.
[01:09:18.871 --> 01:09:19.692]  Oh, don't do it to babies.
[01:09:20.933 --> 01:09:28.117]  But see, they don't count a baby inside mama, that poor little baby, as a human, so they can get hit.
[01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:33.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me read you this article.
[01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:48.444]  A shocking new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that when pregnant women are given COVID vaccinations during their first or second trimester, they suffer an 82% spontaneous abortion rate.
[01:09:49.304 --> 01:10:02.015]  How many videos do I have out of Thailand, and out of areas of Africa, you name it, where the women go, the women go, they come to our village, give us shot, then I lose my baby, I feel my baby kicking, and then he not kick no more, and then two days later he come out.
[01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:17.270]  This stunning finding, explained below, is self-evident from the data published in the new study entitled, Preliminary Findings of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Women.
[01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:30.022]  Just as disturbing as the data is the fact that the study authors apparently sought to deliberately obfuscate the truth about the vaccines causing spontaneous abortion.
[01:10:31.479 --> 01:10:32.981]  If you understand, this was a temporary cover-up.
[01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:45.036]  By obfuscating numbers in their own calculations, originally brought to our attention by a life science news article, we checked with our own science contacts to review the data and double-check all the math.
[01:10:45.496 --> 01:10:48.921]  In doing so, we were able to confirm, this is natural news, two things.
[01:10:50.424 --> 01:10:58.190]  Yes, the study shows an 82% rate of spontaneous abortions in expectant mothers given COVID vaccines during their first and second trimesters.
[01:10:58.771 --> 01:10:59.752]  They may be the lucky ones.
[01:10:59.792 --> 01:11:01.153]  Imagine what's going to happen to the kids that are born.
[01:11:01.573 --> 01:11:12.522]  Number two, yes, the study authors either deliberately sought to hide the facts in dishonest obfuscation, he's pointing below, or they are incompetent and made a glaring error that brings into question their credibility.
[01:11:12.882 --> 01:11:16.765]  In other words, the study was almost certainly a cover-up to try to calm
[01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:22.494]  Vaccinated pregnant women is perfectly safe, but the study data actually shows the opposite.
[01:11:22.735 --> 01:11:26.017]  How many nurses have we shown you going, I took it, my baby died, I'll do it again?
[01:11:26.037 --> 01:11:27.158]  Because I'm a hero.
[01:11:29.636 --> 01:11:31.497]  Because women are survivors.
[01:11:31.577 --> 01:11:47.521]  And in a normal travel situation, if an enemy comes through and kills all the men and kidnaps you, if you're a woman, genetically, and don't fight back, get hauled off to their kingdom a hundred miles away or wherever, and are getting gang-raped, and you put up with that, you will pass on more humans, you will survive.
[01:11:49.813 --> 01:11:51.434]  So women go under Stockholm.
[01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:55.676]  It's why the Romans, the Aztecs, anybody would go capture the enemy, they kill all the men.
[01:11:56.197 --> 01:11:57.177]  They keep the women and children.
[01:11:57.197 --> 01:11:59.338]  Because they would subserve and be slaves.
[01:12:00.759 --> 01:12:04.841]  Women under pressure, on average, will buckle.
[01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:10.484]  Even though they don't like it at first, they will then trick their mind, like the Japanese saying, if rape is inevitable, enjoy it.
[01:12:11.845 --> 01:12:16.988]  And they will subserve themselves and put up with it.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:20.660]  And that's it.
[01:12:22.181 --> 01:12:34.464]  And so, they are killing the babies, and the women literally go, in the news article we've shown you, I had a six-month-old daughter and she died, but it's worth it, I'll take it again.
[01:12:38.825 --> 01:12:43.387]  The death of your own child is not a big deal, because you're a hero!
[01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:46.347]  Because you can't admit the system's evil, because that's scary, isn't it?
[01:12:47.068 --> 01:12:48.008]  Believe me, it is scary.
[01:12:50.293 --> 01:12:54.514]  700 of 827 women were vaccinated in the third trimester.
[01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.815]  They manipulate the tables even higher than what they said.
[01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:04.156]  Table 4 from the study shows below reveals the total of 827 women, pregnant women, were studied.
[01:13:04.316 --> 01:13:09.837]  Out of the 827 women, 700 of them received their first vaccine in the third trimester of pregnancy.
[01:13:11.218 --> 01:13:14.518]  This means 127 women, which is 827 of 700, received a vaccine during their first or second trimesters.
[01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:20.102]  And it goes on from there.
[01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:29.376]  Out of 127 women receiving vaccines during their first and second trimesters, 104 spontaneous abortions occurred before their pregnancies hit the 20-week mark.
[01:13:29.817 --> 01:13:33.162]  These are indicated as spontaneous abortions on the table.
[01:13:33.903 --> 01:13:34.924]  It's simple math.
[01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.327]  104 spontaneous abortions during the first 20 weeks.
[01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:46.639]  Out of 127 women who received vaccines in their first and second trimesters, calculates 82% rate of spontaneous abortions among these pregnant women who are vaccinated.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.567]  It's important to note that the deaths of unborn babies during the third trimester are known as stillbirths.
[01:13:53.127 --> 01:13:54.709]  And not spontaneous abortions.
[01:13:55.069 --> 01:14:00.273]  Thus, the spontaneous abortions could not have possibly occurred in women vaccinated in the third trimester.
[01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:15.426]  Thus, the study authors dishonestly used the wrong denominator of 827 for their spontaneous abortions calculations, which they should have used denominator 127, which is the number of women receiving vaccines during their first trimesters.
[01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:26.409]  Put another way, it's impossible for women who've been vaccinated for the first time during their third trimester to have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks, since they weren't vaccinated during the first 20 weeks.
[01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:28.870]  And pregnant women aren't time travelers.
[01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.191]  Thus, the women shouldn't be included in the denominator used to calculate the spontaneous abortion rate.
[01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.611]  But they did it to hide it.
[01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:38.432]  But it's still a massive, what, one-third death rate.
[01:14:41.348 --> 01:14:43.069]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:14:43.869 --> 01:14:45.609]  Articles up at Infowars.com.
[01:14:45.769 --> 01:14:45.869]  Oh!
[01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.510]  She's able to do it.
[01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:49.030]  Perfect timing with this breaking.
[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:54.932]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is scheduled to join us in the next segment.
[01:14:54.992 --> 01:14:56.172]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:57.033]  We've been trying to get her for months.
[01:14:57.373 --> 01:15:00.154]  She's suddenly able to come on straight ahead.
[01:15:00.694 --> 01:15:04.155]  And then China threatens nuclear war with the United States.
[01:15:04.175 --> 01:15:05.095]  But they're not the threat.
[01:15:05.615 --> 01:15:08.196]  White supremacists are killing everybody everywhere!
[01:15:08.556 --> 01:15:10.597]  Why, they're just crawling out from under rocks!
[01:15:11.317 --> 01:15:13.479]  Please never forget, we can't be on air without you.
[01:15:13.939 --> 01:15:16.362]  Every day we're on air is precious, and a blessing from the Lord.

[01:15:40.964 --> 01:15:46.489]  The Tri-Iodine, the good halogen for your fertility, for your stamina, for your libido, for your immune system.
[01:15:46.949 --> 01:15:47.810]  Iodine is so key.
[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:51.813]  The Tri-Iodine, $16 a bottle with free shipping, that's almost a lost liter.
[01:15:52.354 --> 01:15:57.138]  Infowarsstore.com, and the X3 is selling out at that price.
[01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:59.020]  So it's gonna end in the next few days.
[01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:08.347]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.208]  InfoWars!
[01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:22.771]  We're pulling up on a relic of when we saw the border.
[01:16:23.931 --> 01:16:25.071]  An internal checkpoint.
[01:16:25.352 --> 01:16:26.672]  What is this, 30 miles off the border?
[01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:27.032]  Right.
[01:16:28.493 --> 01:16:30.054]  So a relic, where they ask your U.S.
[01:16:30.115 --> 01:16:31.516]  citizen, are you any kind of man?
[01:16:32.036 --> 01:16:33.357]  I'm like, no, I'm not the Border Patrol.
[01:16:33.377 --> 01:16:35.679]  I don't complete the smuggling process.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.724]  What the Biden administration is doing is they are actually completing the smuggling cycle.
[01:16:41.004 --> 01:16:44.807]  They're helping cartels make money hand over foot.
[01:16:44.827 --> 01:16:49.351]  I don't dislike the average Border Patrol agent, but now it's all vestigial.
[01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:51.533]  Like tits on a boar.
[01:16:52.894 --> 01:16:53.815]  There is no border.
[01:16:59.025 --> 01:17:00.388]  They got the dogs and everything.
[01:17:02.132 --> 01:17:02.853]  Little doggies.
[01:17:06.658 --> 01:17:07.078]  They asked us.
[01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:08.500]  How you doing?
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.120]  How you doing, guys?
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:09.380]  Good.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.681]  Anybody else back here?
[01:17:10.781 --> 01:17:11.422]  One person.
[01:17:11.442 --> 01:17:12.122]  One person back here.
[01:17:12.142 --> 01:17:13.043]  Nobody behind you, sir?
[01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:13.243]  No.
[01:17:13.423 --> 01:17:15.065]  You guys US citizens?
[01:17:15.205 --> 01:17:15.425]  Yes.
[01:17:15.585 --> 01:17:16.726]  We are not the Border Patrol.
[01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:17.987]  We are not smuggling any people.
[01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:19.728]  Hope not.
[01:17:19.749 --> 01:17:20.649]  We're not the Border Patrol.
[01:17:20.889 --> 01:17:23.592]  The Border Patrol smuggles them across and gives them to Catholic Charities.
[01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:25.313]  The Border Patrol smuggles them across?
[01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:25.733]  Damn right.
[01:17:25.753 --> 01:17:26.674]  We got all the video, man.
[01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.075]  No, we don't smuggle them across.
[01:17:28.095 --> 01:17:28.596]  Yep, you do.
[01:17:28.636 --> 01:17:29.436]  This is the stigil.
[01:17:29.736 --> 01:17:30.157]  It's for who?
[01:17:30.457 --> 01:17:31.198]  The stigil.
[01:17:31.238 --> 01:17:31.898]  What's the stigil?
[01:17:32.198 --> 01:17:34.861]  The stigil means like tits on a boar.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:35.980]  Okay.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.601]  Means the border's been gotten rid of, the whole U.N.
[01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:39.061]  program.
[01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:39.822]  Okay.
[01:17:39.842 --> 01:17:40.622]  You guys know about it?
[01:17:41.162 --> 01:17:41.702]  Yeah.
[01:17:41.722 --> 01:17:49.426]  We don't smuggle people though.
[01:17:49.446 --> 01:17:50.366]  We don't smuggle people though.
[01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:56.428]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:17:56.788 --> 01:17:58.429]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:59.690]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:00.550]  That's who we are.
[01:18:01.991 --> 01:18:02.871]  We don't smuggle people though.
[01:18:03.908 --> 01:18:05.990]  I mean, this is like every 10 minutes now.
[01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:11.774]  So I'm wondering if they're picking them up at Donna and only picking up women and children.
[01:18:12.435 --> 01:18:13.316]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:17.759]  So once they get to the destination city of their choice, they're free to go.
[01:18:17.879 --> 01:18:21.742]  They're free to go and the government will never find them again unless they want to be found.
[01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:22.623]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[01:18:24.344 --> 01:18:30.269]  The root cause are the messages coming from the Biden White House encouraging people to come, encouraging children.
[01:18:32.611 --> 01:18:33.572]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:54.679]  Yeah, we don't smuggle people, though.
[01:18:55.219 --> 01:18:59.763]  What the Biden administration is doing is they are actually completing the smuggling cycle.
[01:19:00.063 --> 01:19:03.866]  They're helping cartels make money hand over foot.
[01:19:04.246 --> 01:19:05.747]  Yeah, we don't smuggle people, though.
[01:19:05.787 --> 01:19:07.788]  Well, you may not, but your comrades do.
[01:19:07.808 --> 01:19:08.409]  Take care.
[01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:13.891]  Do they smuggle people, Tim?
[01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:16.492]  Well, they definitely help with it.
[01:19:16.832 --> 01:19:18.233]  That's for sure, from what we've seen.
[01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:22.156]  And he seemed like a nice guy.
[01:19:22.176 --> 01:19:24.937]  Wasn't trying to be a d***.
[01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:26.819]  But I did teach him about today's word, vestigial.
[01:19:33.883 --> 01:19:34.884]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:19:34.964 --> 01:19:36.705]  I don't even know what this is.
[01:19:36.745 --> 01:19:37.705]  How did he get here?
[01:19:39.801 --> 01:19:41.883]  I just caught you, American!
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:44.264]  You visited Bandar Video!
[01:19:45.165 --> 01:19:48.447]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[01:19:48.968 --> 01:19:54.532]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[01:19:54.712 --> 01:19:57.194]  Conflict.
[01:19:57.214 --> 01:20:01.257]  It comes from China.
[01:20:05.345 --> 01:20:11.254]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:45.109 --> 01:20:46.170]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:56.059]  We have Dr. Sherry Tidpenny, who has been listed by the EU, by the globalists, by the Democrats as one of the top people.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.462]  They want to shut down and they want to silence.
[01:20:58.502 --> 01:21:06.910]  She's a medical doctor, who now for 20 years saw with her own practices what was happening with vaccines, and she's been a champion of warning the public.
[01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:14.413]  And she was out there before the inoculations even began with this experimental shot saying, I believe it's going to cause serious illnesses and death.
[01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:23.337]  All the other top scientists like Wolfgang Wudarg and the former chief scientist at Pfizer have gone public warning of this and now
[01:21:24.057 --> 01:21:24.738]  It's happened.
[01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:35.567]  So I think it's just best with all that's unfolded, since he was on with us four months ago, that interview went viral, to just have the floor cover whatever she thinks is most important with what is unfolding now.
[01:21:35.587 --> 01:21:44.194]  And now the targeting of newborn babies with the parents enrolling them in these studies just seems to me like total Nuremberg violations.
[01:21:44.494 --> 01:21:47.957]  Dr. Tenpenny, thanks for spending time with us, and we're really proud of the work you've been doing.
[01:21:49.158 --> 01:21:52.321]  Thank you so much for having me back, Alex, and it's a pleasure to be here.
[01:21:53.098 --> 01:21:54.799]  Okay, we only got about 40 minutes with you.
[01:21:54.859 --> 01:21:55.599]  You got the floor.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.521]  What do people need to know since you were last on?
[01:21:57.861 --> 01:22:00.402]  Vindication, I know, is not sweet for you.
[01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:01.543]  You tried to stop this.
[01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:08.036]  Yeah, I have been trying to stop it very loudly since the beginning, since March of last year.
[01:22:08.076 --> 01:22:12.139]  In fact, you know, as you know, my schedule has been really packed with interviews.
[01:22:12.199 --> 01:22:17.663]  I've done well over 450 now since March, since actually February of last year.
[01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:23.126]  And for people who don't know what I do, I mean, I've been doing this for going, it'll be 21 years in September.
[01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:28.870]  I've logged more than 40,000 hours of personal research into problems associated with vaccines.
[01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:31.171]  That I've been on broadcast podcasts.
[01:22:31.251 --> 01:22:34.853]  I've written two books which are currently not in print for various reasons right now.
[01:22:35.213 --> 01:22:38.435]  But I've written a new e-book called the 20 Mechanisms of Injury.
[01:22:38.795 --> 01:22:42.578]  How the COVID shots can make you sick and possibly kill you.
[01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:46.400]  We're actually doing a training video on this on July the 10th.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:49.241]  You can register by going to DrTenpenny.com.
[01:22:49.822 --> 01:22:55.385]  If it's the first time to our website there should be a pop-up that that that greets you to have you register for the webinar.
[01:22:55.945 --> 01:23:12.059]  If you've been there before, you will have to click on the events button at the top, and it will say live webinar, because it's actually 20 plus mechanisms, Alex, because I did this webinar in May, and as it turned out, not very good planning on my part.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.441]  Mother's Day weekend.
[01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:19.443]  And so we've had a lot of people who've said, gosh, I missed it.
[01:23:19.503 --> 01:23:20.224]  I was out of town.
[01:23:20.264 --> 01:23:20.824]  We were busy.
[01:23:20.864 --> 01:23:21.825]  We had family over.
[01:23:22.145 --> 01:23:23.386]  Can you please do it again?
[01:23:23.486 --> 01:23:26.047]  So by popular demand, we're doing it on July the 10th.
[01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:29.489]  A lot of people said there was so much information the first time.
[01:23:29.509 --> 01:23:30.990]  I want to listen to it a second time.
[01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:34.612]  And you've got a lot of nurses, a lot of doctors, a lot of scientists, but also common people.
[01:23:34.652 --> 01:23:38.874]  They're going to hear a medical doctor go through a huge class.
[01:23:38.915 --> 01:23:41.876]  So we've got the information we need to be leaders in our communities.
[01:23:42.136 --> 01:23:43.057]  This is so important.
[01:23:44.571 --> 01:23:50.113]  Yeah, and it's the 20 Mechanisms of Injury, and actually I found multiple more that we're going to be talking about.
[01:23:50.373 --> 01:24:09.999]  So not only is it a refresher, because I really believe that the key to learning, repetition is the key to learning, so people can hear it again, of how they can warn people who are still on the fence, and Alex, more importantly, as people have gone through, I heard earlier today that somewhere around 47% of people in the U.S.
[01:24:10.039 --> 01:24:11.540]  have gotten one of these shots.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.761]  I'm not sure if that's a real number, but let's just go with it and say that it is.
[01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:29.844]  As they start to get sick, because they are going to, you need to know what to look for, what to watch for, because if you catch these symptoms early, and we're going to talk about this in the webinar, that there may be some things that you can do to help.
[01:24:30.384 --> 01:24:40.326]  But one of the important things is you can file a VAERS report and you can educate your doctor and say, doctor, not only, yes, my mother, my father, my sister, my best friend, my child,
[01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.748]  Is having side effects from these shots.
[01:24:44.048 --> 01:24:49.853]  You don't have to run them through a hundred million dollar medical workup or a hundred thousand dollar medical workup.
[01:24:50.153 --> 01:24:53.216]  You can just see that this is a side effect of one of these shots.
[01:24:53.826 --> 01:24:54.966]  Act accordingly.
[01:24:55.447 --> 01:24:58.908]  So you've got bullets for your gun, metaphorically to speak.
[01:24:59.228 --> 01:25:02.269]  You can hopefully still keep people from getting the shot.
[01:25:02.589 --> 01:25:04.170]  Keep them from getting the second shot.
[01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:07.431]  If they start to have side effects, you know what to look for.
[01:25:07.611 --> 01:25:10.192]  And we're going to talk some new things, some new mechanisms.
[01:25:10.232 --> 01:25:11.852]  We're going to talk about the magnetism.
[01:25:12.152 --> 01:25:13.733]  We're going to talk about myocarditis.
[01:25:14.053 --> 01:25:17.194]  We're going to talk about tissue modification.
[01:25:17.714 --> 01:25:19.836]  We're going to talk about multiple other things.
[01:25:19.876 --> 01:25:24.201]  I won't let the cat out of the bag, but some serious things that people need to know about.
[01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:29.086]  Additional ways how these shots are designed to make you sick and even kill you.
[01:25:29.647 --> 01:25:32.389]  And by the way, Doctor, I was really trying to give you the floor because you've got a lot to say.
[01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:36.212]  But thousands of other medical doctors they've tried to censor and block.
[01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:41.275]  Davos Group coming out two days ago and saying we're working with governments to suppress people and you by name.
[01:25:41.796 --> 01:25:45.198]  When mainline science, mainline doctors all agree with you.
[01:25:45.298 --> 01:25:51.622]  Now, you were one of the first saying this, but now almost every doctor I see and my personal doctor agrees with you but won't come on air.
[01:25:52.082 --> 01:25:54.344]  A Rob Dews personal doctor agrees won't come on air.
[01:25:54.364 --> 01:26:00.128]  An OGBYN I know won't come on air, but says every woman that's taken the vaccine they knows had a miscarriage, it was pregnant.
[01:26:00.448 --> 01:26:04.511]  I mean, this is what you're saying is, they try to act like on CNN you're out in left field.
[01:26:04.771 --> 01:26:06.092]  You're covering mainline science.
[01:26:06.112 --> 01:26:13.138]  We had Dr. Angela Farall on yesterday, and she was saying, I can't say that this isn't sinister, it's on purpose.
[01:26:13.378 --> 01:26:15.960]  She said this is all mainline science they're going against.
[01:26:17.156 --> 01:26:17.857]  It absolutely is.
[01:26:17.877 --> 01:26:27.387]  And so all these people who say that we are anti-science, conspiracy theorists, tinfoil hat, anti-vaccine, and so therefore we have nothing to say.
[01:26:27.807 --> 01:26:38.658]  You know, Alex, what it comes down to, and you know this better than anybody, is that when they can't beat you on the science, the only thing they have left is mudslinging, name-calling, and character assassination.
[01:26:39.058 --> 01:26:40.360]  So for me, it's sort of like,
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.741]  OK, it's happened before.
[01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.242]  It's been going on for a long time.
[01:26:44.562 --> 01:26:51.947]  It reminds me of when I was in the first grade, when my mom said to me, you know, Sherry, sticks and stones can break your bones, but names can never hurt you.
[01:26:52.307 --> 01:27:02.954]  Don't stop what you're doing just because somebody is trying to call you names and do character assassination because they can't beat me on the science and they know it.
[01:27:03.354 --> 01:27:03.814]  And you know what?
[01:27:03.834 --> 01:27:09.617]  There were a lot of doctors, Alex, a lot of doctors that took our webinar the first time that actually reached out to me.
[01:27:09.717 --> 01:27:17.681]  Medical doctors, MDs, DOs, naturopaths, who reached out to me after the webinar and they were like, wow, I had no idea.
[01:27:17.701 --> 01:27:18.742]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:18.802 --> 01:27:21.703]  The information you gave us was so valuable.
[01:27:22.124 --> 01:27:26.306]  So if we can convert them one doctor at a time, that one doctor sees
[01:27:27.206 --> 01:27:28.188]  5,000 patients.
[01:27:28.468 --> 01:27:39.299]  So perhaps of those 5,000 patients, we can keep more of them from being injected with this genetic modification technology that will permanently and irreversibly change your genes.
[01:27:49.361 --> 01:27:53.663]  We're going to talk about the magnetism and it's real.
[01:27:53.803 --> 01:28:06.028]  I want to read you a couple of title articles of articles and things that I found because, you know, you showed that little bit of a screenshot of when I testified at the statehouse down in Columbus to promote our bill and it looks as though the bill is going to pass.
[01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:10.630]  Absolutely, the bill is going to pass so that employers in the state of Ohio cannot
[01:28:16.335 --> 01:28:33.309]  I'm happy to be drug through the mill if that's going to keep our people in the state of Ohio and perhaps set a precedent to other states so that employers cannot make you get an experimental, not proven, no long-term study injection in order to keep a job to feed your family and keep a roof over your head.
[01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:34.589]  Well, I gotta say this.
[01:28:34.869 --> 01:28:36.510]  Hollywood stars mean nothing to me.
[01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:37.330]  Politicians.
[01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:38.810]  You know, I was with Trump yesterday.
[01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:39.411]  He's a good guy.
[01:28:39.451 --> 01:28:42.091]  I like him overall, but he got lied to about the vaccine.
[01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:44.892]  But, you know, I didn't get excited being 20 feet from Trump.
[01:28:45.332 --> 01:28:49.974]  But with you, I get so excited because of your leadership, how you've been right, and how you stand against tyranny.
[01:28:50.274 --> 01:28:52.434]  We admire Dr. Sherry Tenpenny so much.
[01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.835]  We're gonna come right back to her.
[01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.455]  We'll give you the website again, and she's gonna have the floor when we come back.
[01:28:56.875 --> 01:28:58.676]  DrTenpenny.com.
[01:28:58.756 --> 01:29:00.236]  DrTenpenny.com.
[01:29:00.276 --> 01:29:01.877]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now!
[01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:05.011]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[01:29:05.051 --> 01:29:06.191]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:07.291]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:08.732]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[01:29:08.752 --> 01:29:09.492]  And Joe Rogan?
[01:29:09.712 --> 01:29:10.213]  Elon Musk?
[01:29:10.353 --> 01:29:11.433]  You know where they tune in, right?
[01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:14.694]  They tune in right here!
[01:29:16.335 --> 01:29:17.075]  InfoWars.
[01:29:17.455 --> 01:29:18.336]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:29:18.636 --> 01:29:19.156]  Today.
[01:29:19.556 --> 01:29:24.938]  I've got a proposal for viewers and listeners that is one of the most important proposals you'll ever get in your life.
[01:29:25.398 --> 01:29:29.500]  I know how good it works because I finally listened to Dr. Edward Grubb.
[01:29:30.595 --> 01:29:35.997]  Seven, eight years ago, when he said to me, Alex, you're exercising a lot, but you're overweight.
[01:29:36.758 --> 01:29:39.299]  You probably have a deficiency in high quality iodine.
[01:29:39.319 --> 01:29:42.180]  Most iodine is bound into the soil or into the food.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.141]  You're not absorbing it.
[01:29:43.181 --> 01:29:45.102]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[01:29:45.142 --> 01:29:54.146]  He showed me articles where the UN admits that 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities and lower IQ because of low iodine in utero and after they were born and as adults.
[01:29:54.246 --> 01:29:59.388]  And so I finally started taking deep earth crystal iodine, but he was the only guy to ever actually go out and
[01:29:59.508 --> 01:30:08.030]  Find an oil company that was digging it out of the ground at 7,000 to 12,000 feet, versus most folks getting it out of seaweed, which still has some good effects, but not as good as what he had.
[01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:09.110]  Well, we have it today.
[01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:10.911]  And that's Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:16.212]  Survival Shield X2 is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:30:16.312 --> 01:30:18.913]  It's 100% Deep Earth Crystal True Nascent Iodine.
[01:30:18.973 --> 01:30:22.795]  But then we developed, working with other scientists, X3.
[01:30:23.255 --> 01:30:25.796]  Now, I'm not saying X2 is better than X3.
[01:30:25.856 --> 01:30:27.217]  They're apples and oranges.
[01:30:27.317 --> 01:30:33.860]  And we have X2 at 50% off in stock with free shipping right now, part of our 4th of July Super Sale.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:39.442]  But I was able to get in a bigger order of X3 because it's become a big seller over the years.
[01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:48.146]  It's got the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine with two other types of clean, good iodine that are better for some people than just one type of iodine.
[01:30:48.286 --> 01:30:55.310]  Some people can't absorb the pure iodine, the atomic iodine, and they need the other types of naturally occurring iodine.
[01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:59.913]  This has all three, so it's apples and it's oranges.
[01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:01.954]  Is an apple better or is an orange better?
[01:31:02.675 --> 01:31:05.136]  Or is a potato better or a tomato better?
[01:31:05.256 --> 01:31:07.737]  Or are black grapes better than green grapes?
[01:31:07.878 --> 01:31:09.979]  Or is this type of squash better than that squash?
[01:31:10.359 --> 01:31:12.700]  Two different things, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.822]  I'd liken it to regular yellow gold being gold, and you got to have white gold.
[01:31:16.962 --> 01:31:18.663]  It's gold, it's just silver-looking.
[01:31:18.763 --> 01:31:24.806]  I mean, it's very similar, but it's two different things at the molecular level, and that's just my goofy way of breaking it down.
[01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:29.128]  So, I want to challenge listeners, and I want to challenge viewers to support the broadcast.
[01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:32.130]  Hell, go to m4warstore.com, right in the middle section right there.
[01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:36.052]  You can become a sponsor and make a one-time gift of $10, $50, $100 to fund us.
[01:31:36.092 --> 01:31:39.934]  That way, after credit card fees and stuff, we get about 95% of it to actually fund
[01:31:40.134 --> 01:31:40.714]  We're good to go.
[01:31:59.506 --> 01:32:00.927]  At the very same time.
[01:32:01.407 --> 01:32:03.988]  And those are X2 and X3.
[01:32:04.348 --> 01:32:09.630]  If you don't know about the bad halogens, fluoride, bromide, chlorine, there's a whole list of them.
[01:32:10.011 --> 01:32:16.233]  They hurt you, they give you cancer, they take over your thyroid, they take over your hypothalamus, they attack your organs.
[01:32:16.834 --> 01:32:23.817]  And if your body doesn't have iodine, it will absorb the bad halogens that Big Brother and the New World Order make sure in everything we do.
[01:32:24.237 --> 01:32:26.818]  And in all these products, all the plastics, and the water.
[01:32:27.378 --> 01:32:31.920]  So, the good part about having this iodine is it blocks those and pulls those out of the body.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:44.044]  So, for adults, for children, for everybody, you need these iodine products, X2 and X3, 50 and 60% off, respectively, with free shipping, double patriot points, through July 4th, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:32:44.084 --> 01:32:45.304]  So, don't procrastinate.
[01:32:45.364 --> 01:32:50.226]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com now and order X2 and X3 and some of the other great products.

[01:33:05.298 --> 01:33:11.204]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.354 --> 01:33:46.222]  Eric Clapton was bullied, one of my favorite musicians, was bullied by his family to take the Pfizer shot.
[01:33:47.598 --> 01:33:49.239]  And of course, you know, it paralyzed him.
[01:33:49.279 --> 01:33:49.960]  He almost died.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:53.723]  And then he knows other people, his personal friends that got basically paralyzed.
[01:33:54.123 --> 01:33:58.707]  Well, now British rocker dies from brain hemorrhage two weeks after AstraZeneca shot.
[01:33:59.447 --> 01:34:00.848]  They even had to put an advisory on it.
[01:34:00.888 --> 01:34:04.211]  How did Dr. Sherry Tenpenny last year know this would happen?
[01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:06.313]  How did other scientists know?
[01:34:06.373 --> 01:34:08.854]  Because they read the medical literature.
[01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:11.196]  Absolutely insane.
[01:34:11.216 --> 01:34:16.200]  So going back to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, osteopathic medical doctor, 21 years.
[01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:27.780]  Exposing this from our own experiences, now in the middle of this depopulation, whatever you call it, please continue and lay out what we're facing.
[01:34:29.315 --> 01:34:31.616]  Well, it's just really a horrifying thing, Alex.
[01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:39.418]  And you know, it's interesting that we just got some notifications yesterday that they really are giving some people sailing shots.
[01:34:39.858 --> 01:34:45.120]  I mean, I and so and that's because they don't want everybody to die all at once, is my opinion of that.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:50.802]  But what's but every single person that has been injected, even if you say, oh, well, I don't I feel fine.
[01:34:50.822 --> 01:34:51.802]  There's nothing wrong with me.
[01:34:52.482 --> 01:34:59.986]  I always sadly say, well, I'm glad that you didn't fall into Category 1 of the 20 Mechanisms of Injuries.
[01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:05.109]  Category 1 is sudden death, which is anaphylactic shock, heart attack, and stroke.
[01:35:05.529 --> 01:35:12.953]  And so you didn't have one of those, so that doesn't mean you're scot-free, because you're going to have spike proteins in your body that can do all kinds of detrimental things.
[01:35:13.294 --> 01:35:17.376]  You can have antibodies to the spike proteins, which will probably be around forever.
[01:35:17.856 --> 01:35:23.159]  The antibodies themselves can attack your lungs, your kidneys, and your livers and cause autoimmune disease.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.701]  And then there's a whole kind of cluster of other types of things.
[01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:30.264]  And that's gonna be greatly expanded on our webinar on July the 10th.
[01:35:30.584 --> 01:35:38.028]  We're gonna talk really in depth about this cardiomyopathy because this cardiomyopathy that all these teenage kids are getting, all these teenage boys.
[01:35:38.889 --> 01:35:42.351]  There was a report in Epoch Times yesterday of the military.
[01:35:42.391 --> 01:35:47.194]  There's 23 military recruits that were hospitalized with serious myocarditis.
[01:35:47.634 --> 01:36:00.464]  So I want people to really know what that is, so that they do not, under any circumstances, allow their teenagers to be injected with this shot, and particularly their teenage boys.
[01:36:00.484 --> 01:36:13.795]  I had a report yesterday, Alex, I had a patient in my office who actually works in a labor and delivery unit in one of the local hospitals, and she said this baby was born and the mother was furious.
[01:36:14.724 --> 01:36:17.828]  That the child wasn't going to be injected with a COVID shot.
[01:36:18.989 --> 01:36:23.454]  Ours old baby was furious that the baby didn't qualify for that.
[01:36:23.854 --> 01:36:26.097]  It's just a travesty of what's happening with our kids.
[01:36:27.435 --> 01:36:30.417]  I don't want to interrupt you, but I mean, you raised the big issue.
[01:36:30.517 --> 01:36:31.417]  You've explained this.
[01:36:31.497 --> 01:36:32.698]  The medical literature admits it.
[01:36:33.178 --> 01:36:36.640]  Some say that the VAERS is maybe 1 out of 10, 1 out of 100.
[01:36:36.721 --> 01:36:39.682]  Some studies say it's about 40 times on average.
[01:36:40.042 --> 01:36:45.045]  For every person that dies or gets sick that reports to it, there are many, many times that don't.
[01:36:45.085 --> 01:36:48.828]  But the way I've seen this described in other studies, and maybe you can clarify it, is
[01:36:49.488 --> 01:36:59.633]  You'll see, oh, a cluster at one military base or a cluster at one nursing home or a cluster at one hospital where they admit, oh, 10 patients died, 20 or 30 got sick from the shot blood clots.
[01:36:59.933 --> 01:37:01.414]  They go, we don't know why it's a cluster here.
[01:37:01.654 --> 01:37:05.035]  Well, that's where there's a good doctor, good nurses that see what happened and reported it.
[01:37:05.456 --> 01:37:07.177]  Others cover it up and keep it quiet.
[01:37:07.197 --> 01:37:10.658]  We've had nurses and doctors on that have said they were ordered to cover it up.
[01:37:10.918 --> 01:37:12.659]  So explain why we hear about clusters.
[01:37:13.159 --> 01:37:16.281]  Isn't that really just where it breaks through and actually the truth gets out?
[01:37:17.705 --> 01:37:21.926]  Well, I got this kind of a cluster meme sent to me yesterday, Alex.
[01:37:22.766 --> 01:37:23.947]  It's four screenshots.
[01:37:23.987 --> 01:37:25.767]  I'm looking at it on my computer right now.
[01:37:26.227 --> 01:37:30.369]  Four screenshots from Newsweek magazine on different dates.
[01:37:30.869 --> 01:37:36.230]  One was dated April 21st, one's dated April 19th, and one is dated June the 29th.
[01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:38.931]  And there's three different headlines, and I'm going to read them to you.
[01:37:39.291 --> 01:37:45.153]  Headline number one, group of Canadians accidentally received saline injection instead of COVID-19.
[01:37:46.519 --> 01:37:54.003]  Title number two, Walgreens stores injects people with saline rather than with COVID vaccine in a mix up.
[01:37:54.404 --> 01:38:00.047]  Title number three, saline injected instead of COVID vaccine in South Carolina.
[01:38:00.607 --> 01:38:02.729]  Is that an accident or is that intentional?
[01:38:02.789 --> 01:38:06.051]  And is this leading to what you just said about clusters?
[01:38:06.211 --> 01:38:11.854]  Are they sending boxes of vials that are just normal saline to certain places and boxes
[01:38:14.155 --> 01:38:28.306]  Well, let me tell you, I was told by a retired Army colonel who has a son in special operations that they were told, hey, we're just giving you saline, don't worry, and that they didn't get sick.
[01:38:28.366 --> 01:38:34.351]  And I've heard from others the exact same thing, that government bureaucrats are just acting like they're getting a shot, they're not even taking it.
[01:38:35.569 --> 01:38:36.169]  Exactly.
[01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:38.090]  And I think that that's just criminal.
[01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:46.172]  And I think that part of it is, in my opinion, and this is just my opinion, they don't want everybody to be sick and dying all at the same time.
[01:38:46.512 --> 01:38:50.153]  We have to have clusters of people who get their shot and everything seems to be okay.
[01:38:51.113 --> 01:39:00.235]  And Dr. Peter McCullough said this yesterday in an interview that he did, where he said the next shot, these boosters are going to be the real thing and are really going to be the kill shots.
[01:39:00.615 --> 01:39:15.149]  I want to mention just briefly Alex, you know when I got taken through the mud like we talked about earlier by the mainstream media and it really didn't matter to me about this whole concept of magnetism and how people are magnetic and I want to read you three titles
[01:39:15.769 --> 01:39:24.535]  Of what I'm actually going to be talking about on the July 10th webinar on the 20 Mechanisms of Injury that you can find by going to dr10petty.com.
[01:39:24.875 --> 01:39:31.239]  If the pop-up doesn't greet you, you can go to the events tab and click on live event, live webinar.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.921]  Listen to these titles.
[01:39:33.001 --> 01:39:34.922]  This is a chapter from a textbook.
[01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:39.611]  Tissue engineering using magnetite nanoparticles.
[01:39:40.211 --> 01:39:45.112]  And it goes through all the steps on how they do this with polyethylene glycol.
[01:39:45.132 --> 01:39:47.373]  They construct 3D tissue like structures.
[01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:50.093]  And what actually happens to the tissues with that.
[01:39:50.553 --> 01:39:52.574]  There is another textbook that I found.
[01:39:52.614 --> 01:39:55.134]  This is a 517 page textbook.
[01:39:55.555 --> 01:39:57.095]  It's available as an e-book.
[01:39:57.675 --> 01:40:00.978]  That was written on, that was published in 2018.
[01:40:01.499 --> 01:40:05.662]  Clinical Applications of Magnetic Nanoparticles.
[01:40:06.403 --> 01:40:08.084]  Another book published in 2017.
[01:40:08.124 --> 01:40:08.525]  318 page book.
[01:40:08.545 --> 01:40:09.706]  Magnetic Nanoparticles in Medicine.
[01:40:15.501 --> 01:40:24.104]  They have known this, they've been working on this for a long time and they want to suspend it in a lipid coating so they can externally move it to where they want it to be with a magnet.
[01:40:24.644 --> 01:40:36.429]  Now, I have to say, just in qualification, like a lot of things that happen in medicine, a lot of things that happen in government, that they start out with good intentions and then the good intentions turn rather nefarious.
[01:40:37.918 --> 01:41:03.715]  The good intention would be if you could put a particle inside of a lipid coating, a magnetic particle, and you could put chemotherapy in there, and you could use an external magnet to move it directly to the cancer so that it could be released at the level of the cancer, wouldn't that be a better thing than injecting people with chemotherapy so that every cell in their body gets dosed and they get terribly sick?
[01:41:04.195 --> 01:41:08.697]  What I was reading is these graphite chemicals they found is designed to go across the blood-brain barrier.
[01:41:09.017 --> 01:41:11.538]  Why would you want this vaccine to go across the blood-brain barrier?
[01:41:12.218 --> 01:41:12.718]  You don't.
[01:41:13.939 --> 01:41:25.683]  I was just making a point that when they first started researching this back in the 70s, I think that there was some people who thought, well, wouldn't it just be cool if we could direct these different places?
[01:41:26.044 --> 01:41:27.684]  And then DARPA gets involved.
[01:41:28.024 --> 01:41:32.026]  And as you know, anything that has DARPA associated with it is just nefarious.
[01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:43.977]  And so now, the graphene can go across the blood-brain barrier, the spike protein can poke holes in the blood-brain barrier, and you can take that spike protein into the brain.
[01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:47.521]  It can modify something called the FUS gene.
[01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:51.725]  When the FUS gene gets modified, it leads to ALS or cancer.
[01:41:52.425 --> 01:42:09.574]  It will modify the DTP, another type of protein that causes frontal temporal lobe degeneration, and that degeneration causes people to lose their ability to speak, lose their ability to read, have facial recognition, or to form words.
[01:42:09.734 --> 01:42:16.318]  And we hear about people being in a fog, just like the autistic kids, but they have a name for frontal lobe, that's called a lobotomy.
[01:42:18.573 --> 01:42:21.115]  Well, frontal lobe is the area right behind the brain.
[01:42:21.175 --> 01:42:23.897]  No, but I'm saying what you just described sounds like a lobotomy.
[01:42:26.399 --> 01:42:27.299]  Well, maybe.
[01:42:27.319 --> 01:42:32.123]  I mean, it's not a physical lobotomy, but it certainly could be a chemical one.
[01:42:32.623 --> 01:42:43.571]  I mean, and it's interesting to me that people, if this spike protein can punch holes in the blood-brain barrier, and we've got magnetite, graphene, other types of things that can get into the brain.
[01:42:44.582 --> 01:42:49.086]  And we know that you can disrupt that FTP-43 protein.
[01:42:49.607 --> 01:42:52.930]  And that causes frontal temporal lobe degeneration.
[01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:56.613]  And people can put cheese on their forehead and make them sick and stay there.
[01:42:56.653 --> 01:42:56.913]  Stay there!
[01:42:56.993 --> 01:42:57.193]  Stay there!
[01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:58.314]  Final segment, Dr. Jerry Dembiny.
[01:42:58.755 --> 01:42:59.115]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.175 --> 01:43:00.356]  I can't wait to hear this information.
[01:43:00.376 --> 01:43:00.977]  This is incredible.
[01:43:02.762 --> 01:43:10.986]  This country, in its 250 years history, has never had traitors as bad as Honoré and Millie and Austin.
[01:43:11.207 --> 01:43:22.253]  These men, once they've been politically, culturally, economically, and using the criminal justice system, defeated, will be known as the new definition of Benedict Arnold.
[01:43:22.593 --> 01:43:23.473]  They are the plague.
[01:43:23.793 --> 01:43:24.634]  They are a curse.
[01:43:25.254 --> 01:43:31.578]  And they are planning, in my view, false flag terror attacks here in America to submit their rollout against us.
[01:43:31.878 --> 01:43:33.319]  They're spoiling for a war.
[01:43:33.579 --> 01:43:35.040]  They're spoiling for a coup.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.041]  They're spoiling to overthrow.
[01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:48.108]  And they're getting ready to carry out terror attacks, that is, their handlers are, to be blamed on those of us that are loyal Americans in our opposition to the destruction of the country and the sellout of the nation.
[01:43:48.308 --> 01:43:55.110]  And they're all over television saying Trump questioning the election is an act of terror and he's going to be dealt with by the military.
[01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:56.370]  The government's going to kill this guy.
[01:43:56.491 --> 01:44:00.172]  And they're on channel saying we need to get members of Congress using the military.
[01:44:00.292 --> 01:44:04.333]  People sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[01:44:04.753 --> 01:44:22.665]  And then General Milley and General Austin and General Honore get up there and click their heels and say, we want to slug out with the American people, and every white person that doesn't salute us is a white supremacist enemy, and we're the Americans, and they're Hitler, and we're gonna get them!
[01:44:22.805 --> 01:44:24.506]  We're ready for war!
[01:44:24.726 --> 01:44:25.587]  Tearing us loose!
[01:44:25.827 --> 01:44:27.148]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[01:44:27.228 --> 01:44:28.769]  We're gonna get America!
[01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.690]  Death to America, says Milley!
[01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:32.492]  Death to America, says Austin!
[01:44:32.672 --> 01:44:34.273]  Death to America, says Honore!
[01:44:49.508 --> 01:44:57.693]  To chronicle the treason and anti-american activities of General Honoré, Austin, and Milley, it would take years.
[01:44:58.293 --> 01:45:01.315]  Let us examine only one small data point.
[01:45:01.835 --> 01:45:16.184]  The gun confiscation that took place after the Katrina hurricane, where peaceful people, high and dry, under the orders of Honoré, had their firearms stolen and taken from them, never to be returned.
[01:45:16.304 --> 01:45:19.046]  The police and National Guard going street by street
[01:45:20.711 --> 01:45:27.997]  House to house, sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[01:45:28.297 --> 01:45:29.938]  You say guns will be taken?
[01:45:29.978 --> 01:45:31.219]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:45:31.439 --> 01:45:32.460]  We will take all weapons.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:39.686]  And now Honoré is organizing the national response for the Democratic Party for gun confiscation.
[01:45:39.846 --> 01:45:44.870]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[01:45:46.791 --> 01:45:48.612]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[01:45:49.092 --> 01:45:52.253]  In the end, police took their weapons, but let them stay in their homes.
[01:45:52.893 --> 01:45:57.655]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:45:59.276 --> 01:46:02.377]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[01:46:02.657 --> 01:46:10.220]  All of a sudden, they were banging on the front door, the side door, and the back door, and they said, let us in.
[01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:14.823]  I said, it's not even loaded.
[01:46:15.303 --> 01:46:17.365]  I really thought they were going to kill me.
[01:46:17.685 --> 01:46:18.145]  They took them.
[01:46:19.627 --> 01:46:21.188]  And they didn't have a right to take them.
[01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.609]  They didn't have a reason to take them.
[01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:24.431]  You never expect to do this in your own country.
[01:46:24.951 --> 01:46:29.395]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[01:46:29.715 --> 01:46:35.460]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're going to have to do if somebody pops around the corner.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.242]  Let me shoot an American.
[01:46:38.762 --> 01:46:41.903]  You know them by their fruits, as Christ said.
[01:46:41.923 --> 01:46:44.844]  A leopard never changes its spots.
[01:46:45.384 --> 01:46:50.726]  Here, in focus, is the treason of Honore against the Second Amendment and America.
[01:46:50.746 --> 01:46:52.106]  Info Wars!
[01:46:52.566 --> 01:46:53.526]  Info Wars!
[01:46:53.986 --> 01:46:54.987]  Info Wars!
[01:46:55.407 --> 01:46:56.367]  Info Wars!
[01:46:56.807 --> 01:46:57.748]  Info Wars!
[01:46:58.168 --> 01:46:59.148]  Info Wars!
[01:47:05.396 --> 01:47:11.321]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.215 --> 01:47:32.420]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, we had to go to that break because the satellites can fire at certain times.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:36.741]  You were in a cliffhanger about if this is attacking the frontal lobe, if it's attacking the
[01:47:37.361 --> 01:47:46.351]  You're about to get to that big event and then largest teacher union to debate demanding vaccinations before returning to in person demanding all students be injected.
[01:47:46.812 --> 01:47:47.933]  What a suicide cult.
[01:47:48.033 --> 01:47:50.135]  What a Russian roulette situation.
[01:47:50.476 --> 01:47:52.077]  Dr. Sherry Timpenny, final segment.
[01:47:52.097 --> 01:47:54.160]  Please, please lay it all out for folks.
[01:47:55.219 --> 01:48:06.050]  Somebody needs to put the NEA on notice that if they actually really follow through with that, that they're going to be sued for a whole litany of things.
[01:48:07.131 --> 01:48:13.016]  Lying about a shot, lying about, you know, that these kids are vulnerable, that they're spreading anything.
[01:48:13.457 --> 01:48:16.440]  Put them on a Nuremberg trial.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:22.681]  For crimes against humanity, somebody needs to sue them up front before they get any farther with this.
[01:48:23.142 --> 01:48:36.825]  Because if that happens, then we have to, then they will have to go through the discovery process and show, prove that they're safe and that there are studies that have been done and that they're safe for 15 to 17 year olds, that they should be given to all kids.
[01:48:37.105 --> 01:48:45.787]  I mean, Indiana came out with a thing a couple of weeks ago that said, if your kids are vaccinated in great age groups K through seven,
[01:48:46.766 --> 01:48:48.526]  They haven't even gotten to that point yet.
[01:48:48.947 --> 01:49:03.271]  But if they've been injected, kindergartners through the 7th grade, then those injected children who are now marked forever and forever will have their genetics modified and most likely will not turn into adult women or adult men.
[01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:11.253]  They will be kind of neutered and be a eunuch as they grow up and will not actually evolve into mature adults.
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:21.885]  But if we've injected them, if parents have been stupid enough to inject their children with these technologies, oh, well, then that will give them privileges.
[01:49:22.265 --> 01:49:23.586]  They won't have to wear a mask.
[01:49:23.846 --> 01:49:25.667]  They can sit with their friends in the lunchroom.
[01:49:25.907 --> 01:49:27.488]  They can play a musical instrument.
[01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:29.510]  They can play with their friends on recess.
[01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:31.251]  They can go and play in sports.
[01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:35.533]  And if they have not been injected, they won't be able to do any of those things.
[01:49:35.874 --> 01:49:37.815]  So now we're separating these kids.
[01:49:38.115 --> 01:49:43.758]  And making them feel terrible, going home and begging their parents, crying, begging, pleading, Mommy, Mommy, please just do anything to stop.
[01:49:43.778 --> 01:49:48.541]  This sounds like the plot of a nightmare science fiction horror movie, but it's really happening.
[01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:50.421]  It's really happening.
[01:49:51.322 --> 01:49:52.503]  I say that every day, Alex.
[01:49:52.563 --> 01:49:55.424]  I feel like I really am literally living in the Matrix.
[01:49:56.365 --> 01:49:56.985]  Please continue.
[01:49:58.317 --> 01:50:02.481]  Well, we're seeing that this is, you know, Dr. Larry Pilevski.
[01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:14.991]  There's a group of us, Alex, that we come to refer to ourselves as the 5 D's, the 5 Doctors, because we've done a lot of webinars together, we support each other, we are colleagues, friends, and we share a lot of information.
[01:50:15.331 --> 01:50:21.776]  And the 5 D's is me, Dr. Larry Pilevski, Dr. Christian Northrup, Dr. Lee Merritt, and Dr. Keri Maude.
[01:50:21.796 --> 01:50:25.980]  These are good doctors fighting Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[01:50:26.917 --> 01:50:27.557]  Absolutely.
[01:50:27.897 --> 01:50:30.058]  And so we refer to ourselves as the 5 D's.
[01:50:30.538 --> 01:50:33.819]  And Larry is a board certified pediatrician.
[01:50:33.839 --> 01:50:39.600]  And Larry has said many, from the beginning, this is not a normal shot.
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:40.840]  It's a bioweapon.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:49.843]  Dr. Lee Merritt, who's an orthopedic surgeon, says, and in the military, and did a full career in the military, said this is a bioweapon.
[01:50:50.163 --> 01:50:55.844]  Dr. Christian Northrup, who's an OB-GYN, has seen all the bleeding problems, saying this is a bioterrorism weapon.
[01:50:56.184 --> 01:51:04.128]  And it was Dr. Keri Maude who was the one who first started talking really loudly in the physician community about the hydrogel in the vaccines or in the shots.
[01:51:04.488 --> 01:51:17.414]  And Dr. Larry has said multiple times, if parents get their kids these shots, they can absolutely, they're just signing away their rights to ever wanting to become a grandparent.
[01:51:18.732 --> 01:51:29.045]  And if they give these kids these 12 to 15 year old kids these shots, if they give it to a 12 year old girl who's already started her periods, is anybody going to keep track to see whether or not she stops them?
[01:51:29.806 --> 01:51:35.013]  If she hasn't started her periods yet, is anybody going to look to see if she ever does?
[01:51:35.856 --> 01:51:37.017]  What about the little boys?
[01:51:37.117 --> 01:51:42.703]  What about the little boys that will never grow into men, will never go through puberty?
[01:51:43.944 --> 01:51:48.148]  They won't develop body hair and facial hair and lower their voice and get muscles and grow tall.
[01:51:48.528 --> 01:51:50.610]  Is anybody going to monitor to see if that happens?
[01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.592]  If we give this to 12-year-old boys?
[01:51:52.972 --> 01:52:00.980]  What happens if we don't get females that grow into women and boys that don't grow into men and they can't reproduce?
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:06.101]  Well, the nefarious people at the top are spending a whole lot of time killing a lot of people off from the top.
[01:52:06.441 --> 01:52:13.083]  They certainly don't want to have all of these children repopulate the planet from the bottom.
[01:52:13.163 --> 01:52:16.684]  And they say everywhere, get rid of the humans, we need to sterilize everybody.
[01:52:16.924 --> 01:52:20.705]  So they're admitting why they're doing it openly while they do it.
[01:52:20.745 --> 01:52:23.906]  It's just madness that people are signing their children on for this.
[01:52:25.228 --> 01:52:27.069]  It is just, it is absolutely madness.
[01:52:27.089 --> 01:52:39.459]  I mean, I see some of these reports, you know, about, you know, there was a report, I think it was the other day on AOL News, they were celebrating the fact that this little three-year-old girl had been enrolled in the most recent clinical study.
[01:52:40.265 --> 01:53:03.730]  I mean, I think these parents who enroll their kids in these studies and they want their babies, these pregnant women who allow themselves to get the shot, and the babies that they allow to put into these roles, and all of the children and the teenagers and all of these people, these parents, I hope eventually all of them will be charged with crimes against humanity and perhaps child abuse.
[01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.606]  They are testing out depopulation.
[01:53:07.626 --> 01:53:08.927]  They're testing the censorship.
[01:53:08.967 --> 01:53:10.128]  They're testing the control.
[01:53:10.208 --> 01:53:12.129]  But I think they've miscalculated.
[01:53:12.289 --> 01:53:14.070]  So many medical doctors are coming out.
[01:53:14.491 --> 01:53:15.711]  So many people are communicating.
[01:53:16.772 --> 01:53:19.034]  I see fear in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' face.
[01:53:19.314 --> 01:53:20.775]  Bill Gates' wife has left him.
[01:53:21.075 --> 01:53:22.836]  Suddenly Bill Gates has been pulled off TV.
[01:53:23.616 --> 01:53:25.718]  Not all is well inside the New World Order.
[01:53:26.775 --> 01:53:28.217]  Well, I certainly hope that's true.
[01:53:28.277 --> 01:53:39.051]  You know, I'm sure that you saw that graphic that came out about us a while ago now by the Center for Digital Hate, you know, which is such an oxymoron name.
[01:53:39.071 --> 01:53:44.038]  Oh, they say it's terrorism in Biden's new report to question lockdowns or vaccines.
[01:53:44.078 --> 01:53:44.999]  That's white supremacism.
[01:53:46.929 --> 01:53:47.929]  Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:53:48.249 --> 01:53:51.510]  And they named us all as the Disinformation Dozen, right?
[01:53:52.030 --> 01:54:01.672]  So it was me, and Del Bigtree, and Bobby Kennedy, and Christian Northrup, Erin Elizabeth, Joe Mercola, a whole bunch of us.
[01:54:01.712 --> 01:54:02.572]  There were 12 people.
[01:54:02.592 --> 01:54:05.233]  You know, Sayer G., Kelly Brogan.
[01:54:05.313 --> 01:54:07.534]  I mean, there's just a whole bunch of us that they just, they called us.
[01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:09.854]  We were the Disinformation Dozen.
[01:54:10.174 --> 01:54:13.715]  And we've added, and we thought, well, wow, they missed a couple of people.
[01:54:14.997 --> 01:54:25.242]  You know, but they blame us for the fact that we are putting out all this information and Biden isn't going to reach his 70% of the American population by July 4th.
[01:54:25.282 --> 01:54:27.063]  I mean, after all... That was my question.
[01:54:27.163 --> 01:54:30.825]  I don't believe it's even 47%, but they admit it's a giant failure for them.
[01:54:31.245 --> 01:54:33.026]  Now they want new lockdowns to make us take it.
[01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:33.826]  It's not working.
[01:54:34.406 --> 01:54:37.908]  If people know it's depopulation and we don't just accept it, it's game over.
[01:54:38.388 --> 01:54:40.269]  I see this as a disaster for the globalists.
[01:54:40.509 --> 01:54:41.430]  It's going to be terrible.
[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:44.151]  People are going to be maimed and die, but they're going to know the truth now.
[01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:47.846]  It is sad and it is true.
[01:54:47.906 --> 01:54:52.028]  I mean, you know, you probably saw this came out a while back now, the SAGE report.
[01:54:52.068 --> 01:55:13.437]  I mean, SAGE is a modeling agency out of the UK and the SAGE report said that, you know, in paragraph 32 and paragraph 55 says it quite clearly that when the third wave comes, which it will, that 65 to 70 percent of people that have had two of the shots will be sick, hospitalized or die.
[01:55:14.468 --> 01:55:25.047]  For folks that don't understand that, why does somebody who's already had it, take the shot, get really sick, or who's already had the vaccines, now that makes you run into anything similar, any type of virus, you have big problems.
[01:55:25.067 --> 01:55:25.528]  What's happening?
[01:55:27.016 --> 01:55:29.759]  It's a process called Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[01:55:30.099 --> 01:55:47.715]  That you develop this antibody, it's a non-binding antibody, and when you get re-exposed to coronaviruses, that it actually drags the coronavirus into your white blood cells and it makes you sicker than you would have ever been if you had never had the shot.
[01:55:48.095 --> 01:55:53.560]  And it causes massive cytokine storm, massive type, it looks like septic shock.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.641]  An organ system failure.
[01:55:55.661 --> 01:56:09.010]  I mean, we had our first, well, one of the, there's been several, but it had an autopsy report of a man, an elderly gentleman who was in perfect health, had no medications, got the shot in order to go into the hospital and have an elective procedure.
[01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:14.634]  He got exposed in the hospital after he'd had the shot to sick people who had COVID.
[01:56:15.034 --> 01:56:17.936]  And he, within several days, massively died.
[01:56:17.996 --> 01:56:20.618]  And they did an autopsy on him because they couldn't understand why.
[01:56:21.138 --> 01:56:21.218]  It's
[01:56:43.775 --> 01:56:48.021]  The animals, when they got re-exposed, got very sick and or died.
[01:56:48.041 --> 01:56:50.345]  In closing, you've got to come back soon.
[01:56:50.365 --> 01:56:55.192]  Why are so many people getting herpes or shingles after they take the shot?
[01:56:56.744 --> 01:57:06.230]  I'm not sure what the exact mechanism of that is, but I'm sure there is something that's releasing these viruses.
[01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:08.952]  I haven't taken the time to dig into that yet.
[01:57:09.312 --> 01:57:11.373]  We know that we're actually getting those reports.
[01:57:12.114 --> 01:57:13.755]  It's not clear to me yet why.
[01:57:14.665 --> 01:57:18.648]  All right, Dr. Tenpenny, T-E-N-Penny.com.
[01:57:19.088 --> 01:57:21.049]  Everybody sign up for the webinar, get it out.
[01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:24.612]  And all you that are along with Big Tech and censorship, remember, you're fools.
[01:57:25.012 --> 01:57:26.233]  You're not part of the establishment.
[01:57:26.253 --> 01:57:27.153]  You're pretending you are.
[01:57:27.353 --> 01:57:28.374]  All of us are under attack.
[01:57:28.454 --> 01:57:30.776]  Left, right, gay, straight, old, young.
[01:57:31.236 --> 01:57:33.257]  Everybody better come together and expose this.
[01:57:33.297 --> 01:57:35.159]  This is Bill Gates' depopulation.
[01:57:35.179 --> 01:57:35.959]  DrTenpenny.com.
[01:57:36.259 --> 01:57:37.460]  Dr. Tenpenny, we love you.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.461]  We appreciate you.
[01:57:38.541 --> 01:57:40.022]  Please come back sooner, okay?
[01:57:41.707 --> 01:57:44.248]  We'll actually make an effort to do that, Alex.
[01:57:44.309 --> 01:57:49.932]  Thank you so much for having me on, and I hope that many of your people will come and join us at the webinar on July 10th.
[01:57:50.052 --> 01:57:50.572]  Absolutely.
[01:57:50.592 --> 01:57:51.132]  God bless you.
[01:57:51.172 --> 01:57:51.573]  Thank you.
[01:57:51.613 --> 01:57:52.013]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.033 --> 01:57:52.793]  Next hour coming up.
[01:57:53.214 --> 01:57:56.656]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[01:57:57.876 --> 01:57:59.537]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:59.897 --> 01:58:03.279]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.442]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:58:09.944 --> 01:58:12.468]  Also, we have the new Free American shirt.
[01:58:12.548 --> 01:58:16.353]  Big, beautiful American flag in camo, in navy blue, and in black.
[01:58:16.514 --> 01:58:18.336]  On the back it says Infowars.com.
[01:58:18.396 --> 01:58:20.039]  This is very triggering to leftists.
[01:58:20.119 --> 01:58:20.880]  They hate this.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.202]  They're gonna have it at the Olympics.
[01:58:22.482 --> 01:58:24.185]  The new Olympic player, transgender U.S.
[01:58:24.245 --> 01:58:26.228]  Olympic BMX rider says his goals.
[01:58:26.548 --> 01:58:28.570]  It's now her, is to burn the U.S.
[01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:29.750]  flag on the Olympic podium.
[01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:32.592]  So, we need to champion the flag, and it funds the InfoWars.
[01:58:32.712 --> 01:58:35.214]  Everyone should get a free American shirt.
[01:58:35.294 --> 01:58:38.657]  On the back, it has the classic InfoWars square to help spread the word.
[01:58:38.737 --> 01:58:46.462]  So, InfoWars.com, it has the big, beautiful American flag across the chest, and simply says, free American in camo, in navy blue, and in black.
[01:58:46.542 --> 01:58:48.504]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are trying to take our country over.
[01:58:48.524 --> 01:58:50.085]  They're trying to shut down the independent media.
[01:58:50.145 --> 01:58:50.785]  And here's the news.
[01:58:50.885 --> 01:58:53.888]  I can't get a lot of supplements, but I can get T-shirts.
[01:58:54.728 --> 01:59:02.190]  That's why it's Operation T-Shirt, and I'm just hoping that we can sell tens of thousands of t-shirts to fund this operation.
[01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:09.352]  It was in 1776, these were high-quality shirts made in America, all the rest of it, and printed in America, so they're costing us like seven, eight, nine bucks apiece.
[01:59:09.492 --> 01:59:11.113]  I could buy crap shirts for like five dollars apiece.
[01:59:11.133 --> 01:59:12.473]  I could buy from China for two dollars apiece.
[01:59:12.553 --> 01:59:13.914]  I'm not doing it, so please get them.
[01:59:13.954 --> 01:59:15.394]  Infowarsstore.com today.
[01:59:15.554 --> 01:59:16.475]  Operation T-Shirt.
[01:59:16.495 --> 01:59:17.195]  Save Infowars.
[01:59:17.215 --> 01:59:17.775]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:55.532 --> 01:59:59.635]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:00.115 --> 02:00:01.496]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.064 --> 02:00:13.924]  I guess you didn't know.
[02:00:13.944 --> 02:00:17.727]  I guess you didn't know.
[02:00:31.519 --> 02:00:35.081]  Mike Adams is ready for war!
[02:00:36.502 --> 02:00:37.303]  The Info War.
[02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:43.366]  He's coming up next segment to cover each new chapter in the COVID depopulation plan becomes more insane.
[02:00:43.907 --> 02:00:45.528]  We are living in a nightmare.
[02:00:45.548 --> 02:00:46.668]  They're trying to just normalize it.
[02:00:46.688 --> 02:00:49.910]  We've got to fight like hell to not let them normalize it.
[02:00:50.471 --> 02:00:51.792]  We're taking phone calls right now.
[02:00:51.912 --> 02:00:53.393]  Mark in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[02:00:53.733 --> 02:00:54.253]  You're on the air.
[02:00:54.293 --> 02:00:54.653]  Go ahead.
[02:00:55.814 --> 02:00:56.214]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:57.215 --> 02:00:57.935]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:59.602 --> 02:01:00.983]  Good to have you here, brother.
[02:01:01.003 --> 02:01:01.684]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:16.318 --> 02:01:18.620]  What they're doing right now is just crazy.
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.481]  You know, with the commission to investigate it and everything.
[02:01:21.501 --> 02:01:31.367]  I can't believe that even... Yeah, they're setting the precedent to try to scare people from protesting and then demonizing a million people because 500 or 600 went into a Capitol, most of them peaceful.
[02:01:31.888 --> 02:01:33.669]  It's just outrageous.
[02:01:34.609 --> 02:01:41.653]  Yes, and here in Colorado, at least in Colorado Springs, we're pretty conservative.
[02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:43.455]  We all know that election was stolen.
[02:01:44.918 --> 02:01:46.939]  A matter of them wanting to listen to it.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:53.364]  But anyhow, yeah, the Ashley Babbitt thing, I watched that whole thing live.
[02:01:53.424 --> 02:01:54.484]  It was ridiculous.
[02:01:54.925 --> 02:01:58.207]  I can't believe that he didn't even have a weapon.
[02:01:58.567 --> 02:02:05.792]  And I love how Trump's exposing it and trying to, anyway.
[02:02:07.573 --> 02:02:13.017]  But I have to rebuttal that last caller, you know, the Trump guy that didn't like Trump,
[02:02:15.166 --> 02:02:24.475]  Well, I mean, I just see now that Trump got the elections stolen from him.
[02:02:24.535 --> 02:02:24.835]  It's gone.
[02:02:24.855 --> 02:02:25.936]  People are even madder at him.
[02:02:26.377 --> 02:02:27.458]  We just can't blame Trump.
[02:02:27.478 --> 02:02:29.080]  We gotta blame ourselves and just move forward.
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:29.900]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:30.921]  Really appreciate you.
[02:02:31.302 --> 02:02:32.463]  Matthew's in Florida.
[02:02:32.503 --> 02:02:36.046]  He wants to respond to the Jewish conspiracy caller earlier.
[02:02:36.066 --> 02:02:36.367]  Go ahead.
[02:02:38.163 --> 02:02:46.172]  Alex, first, I appreciate you having me on, but to preface what I'm going to say... And I'm sorry, I can't give you nine minutes while cameras are up against the gun.
[02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:46.913]  You've got two minutes.
[02:02:46.933 --> 02:02:47.454]  Go, go.
[02:02:48.395 --> 02:02:53.260]  So, what I wanted to say is I went to Jewish state school, K-12.
[02:02:55.010 --> 02:03:09.201]  Grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, my dad was born in a DP camp, is now a doctor, and all these theories, the Rothschilds, all that stuff, that was part of the propaganda that resulted in my grandparents even being in the concentration camps.
[02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:23.673]  Growing up, though, and seeing that, and being in shuls, where the rabbis seemed to not take the side of Israel the way my Hebrew teachers were taking the side of Israel, when buses would blow up in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,
[02:03:24.412 --> 02:03:45.807]  That made me realize, maybe there's something going on here, but at the end of the day, the fact that the Jews have been so persecuted over time, and the fact that in these holidays, all of them involve persecution, whether it's people forcibly coming into private homes and forcing them to eat pork, created a religion, right?
[02:03:46.047 --> 02:03:47.629]  All these things, it was all persecution.
[02:03:47.849 --> 02:03:52.132]  So, unless religion was the original psyop, and
[02:03:53.112 --> 02:03:53.694]  All right.
[02:04:01.127 --> 02:04:02.227]  You have people like Milton Friedman?
[02:04:02.387 --> 02:04:04.308]  Doesn't that prove something wrong, don't you think?
[02:04:05.208 --> 02:04:05.889]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[02:04:05.949 --> 02:04:13.371]  I mean, obviously there's Jews of diverse backgrounds and ideas, and that's why I try to just... All this stuff becomes a tail-chasing deal.
[02:04:13.771 --> 02:04:19.993]  But then you have the ADL coming out saying get rid of free speech, and then labeling anybody that's for America bad.
[02:04:20.474 --> 02:04:24.415]  That is going to cause major pressure to be put on Jews that are not part
[02:04:24.935 --> 02:04:31.143]  Alex, one other thing, when my dad first came to this country, when they first came here and he was a baby and was growing up,
[02:04:43.571 --> 02:04:58.511]  The only anti-Semitism and discrimination that he experienced in northern New Jersey was from the liberal Jews who said, you guys are diseased, you guys are giving us a bad name, you should go back, why'd you come here, you're making us look bad.
[02:04:58.531 --> 02:04:59.973]  That's what I've seen.
[02:05:00.193 --> 02:05:01.034]  I've definitely seen that.
[02:05:01.074 --> 02:05:01.455]  Thank you, sir.
[02:05:07.628 --> 02:05:09.188]  We are in a complete war!
[02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:11.309]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic!
[02:05:11.329 --> 02:05:12.289]  You fools!
[02:05:12.829 --> 02:05:13.869]  I want them shut down.
[02:05:13.929 --> 02:05:14.830]  I want them silenced.
[02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:15.670]  I want them muted.
[02:05:15.710 --> 02:05:17.570]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:26.112]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:29.813]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[02:05:30.633 --> 02:05:33.915]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Ted!
[02:05:34.335 --> 02:05:36.877]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[02:05:37.397 --> 02:05:41.400]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.181]  I want them shut down.
[02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:47.063]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[02:05:47.383 --> 02:05:50.985]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[02:05:51.345 --> 02:05:52.366]  Everybody gets to speak.
[02:05:52.646 --> 02:05:53.607]  I'm a bad person!
[02:05:53.647 --> 02:05:54.347]  I question things!
[02:05:54.427 --> 02:05:54.868]  I'm evil!
[02:05:55.008 --> 02:05:55.348]  I don't...
[02:06:00.029 --> 02:06:01.570]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:24.982]  From the frontlines!
[02:06:31.559 --> 02:06:36.602]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:49.580 --> 02:07:00.128]  All right, we were born for this time, and there's no doubt now that the so-called vaccine is deadly, and that it is causing infertility, heart attacks, all sorts of problems.
[02:07:00.648 --> 02:07:03.530]  All the vaccines were designed according to what Fauci and Bill Gates wanted.
[02:07:04.371 --> 02:07:05.812]  The wheels have completely come off.
[02:07:05.852 --> 02:07:07.253]  The world economy is collapsing.
[02:07:07.293 --> 02:07:08.434]  The third world's imploding.
[02:07:09.014 --> 02:07:12.097]  10 million illegals are coming across just the Texas border.
[02:07:12.637 --> 02:07:17.561]  The Border Patrol estimates 5 million already have, another 5 million by October, end of fiscal year.
[02:07:19.025 --> 02:07:20.506]  This is the collapse of the country.
[02:07:20.527 --> 02:07:25.872]  More than 40% of San Franciscans plan to leave this year, saying the city is deteriorating and has collapsed.
[02:07:26.392 --> 02:07:31.157]  This is a world government plan to collapse and end the social contract.
[02:07:32.178 --> 02:07:41.987]  Mike Adams has been doing a great job over at nationalnews.com chronicling the insane amount of mainline prestigious studies
[02:07:43.072 --> 02:07:47.434]  That in their attempts to whitewash what's happening, documented.
[02:07:47.474 --> 02:07:59.121]  The New England Journal of Medicine, that's very prestigious, saying that 82% of individuals that are pregnant that take the inoculation, the baby dies.
[02:08:00.353 --> 02:08:00.994]  We've got that.
[02:08:01.054 --> 02:08:03.676]  We've got a British rocker dying from brain hemorrhage.
[02:08:04.097 --> 02:08:06.019]  I mean, this stuff is every day.
[02:08:06.379 --> 02:08:09.022]  Study links chest pain, heart attacks in the troops.
[02:08:09.703 --> 02:08:13.967]  They've had to put advisements in there saying that it can cause a heart attack.
[02:08:14.388 --> 02:08:17.311]  Norway to pay compensation for AstraZeneca side effects.
[02:08:19.653 --> 02:08:26.374]  And now they're sending the Delta variant teams in to demand their way into your house, which is the next phase of all this.
[02:08:26.414 --> 02:08:33.376]  And they're talking about worldwide mask mandates and more lockdowns, which haven't even ended in places like England and Australia or Canada.
[02:08:33.976 --> 02:08:39.597]  And you have Canadian officials saying, we're doing this to silence everyone for our political takeover.
[02:08:40.097 --> 02:08:41.398]  So there's no longer any doubt.
[02:08:41.418 --> 02:08:42.858]  You hit the moment of emergence.
[02:08:43.697 --> 02:08:47.500]  When the tyranny isn't hiding anymore, it's tanks are rolling against you.
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.784]  And so Mike Adams is here to talk about the spontaneous abortions.
[02:08:53.969 --> 02:08:56.011]  He's here to talk about the studies.
[02:08:56.051 --> 02:08:58.953]  He's here to talk about why are they giving saline everywhere?
[02:08:58.973 --> 02:09:00.594]  Well, that's for certain groups and not others.
[02:09:00.894 --> 02:09:02.015]  It's in the news now confirmed.
[02:09:02.055 --> 02:09:02.835]  We heard six months ago.
[02:09:03.255 --> 02:09:04.736]  You go into the Walgreens wherever they go.
[02:09:04.796 --> 02:09:05.477]  Oh, you're black?
[02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:06.137]  Oh, let me see.
[02:09:06.177 --> 02:09:06.978]  Oh, you get this shot.
[02:09:07.438 --> 02:09:11.741]  Of course, the Walgreens or CVS or Walmart employees aren't in on it.
[02:09:12.101 --> 02:09:13.762]  They're just following some directive.
[02:09:13.802 --> 02:09:16.584]  But who's running those directives?
[02:09:16.604 --> 02:09:18.285]  We were talking about saline shots six months ago.
[02:09:18.625 --> 02:09:20.447]  Now it's hundreds of articles.
[02:09:21.127 --> 02:09:21.727]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:09:21.767 --> 02:09:22.347]  It's great to join you.
[02:09:22.367 --> 02:09:29.430]  And exactly as you mentioned, the New England Journal of Medicine published a science paper with a data set that shows that four out of five pregnancies
[02:09:43.582 --> 02:09:52.765]  Where the women are given these COVID injections during the first or second trimesters end in spontaneous abortions in less than 20 weeks.
[02:09:53.145 --> 02:09:56.266]  That's 82% is what the data show.
[02:09:56.726 --> 02:10:11.970]  And yet, at the same time, these study authors apparently attempted to obfuscate that fact, and they included in their denominator of their calculation of the percentage, they included 700 other women who weren't vaccinated until their third trimester,
[02:10:12.779 --> 02:10:24.282]  And then said, well, gosh, these 700 women vaccinated in the third trimester didn't have spontaneous abortions in the first 20 weeks, which they couldn't have, Alex, because pregnant women aren't time travelers.
[02:10:24.842 --> 02:10:31.824]  They can't go back in time and have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks when they're injected in the last eight weeks.
[02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:38.486]  So they use this obfuscation in order to try to conclude that the vaccines really aren't causing
[02:10:39.006 --> 02:10:47.769]  Any kind of spontaneous abortions, when their own data show that it's actually killing 82% of unborn human babies in the first 20 weeks.
[02:10:47.829 --> 02:11:04.015]  So Alex, this is a confirmation that the depopulation component is functioning exactly as engineered, that they are going to see millions of reductions of live births, probably just in the next 12 months, who knows over the next few years,
[02:11:04.668 --> 02:11:08.711]  This is like that Clive Owens sci-fi movie, what was it called?
[02:11:09.171 --> 02:11:10.512]  Children of Men, I think?
[02:11:10.592 --> 02:11:11.853]  Yes, where everybody's sterilized.
[02:11:12.593 --> 02:11:13.474]  Right.
[02:11:13.514 --> 02:11:15.295]  We're entering that sci-fi future right now.
[02:11:15.355 --> 02:11:16.036]  It's all confirmed.
[02:11:17.397 --> 02:11:26.383]  What about the hundreds of articles I have here, AP, Reuters, all of them admitting that, oh, it's an accident, thousands here, hundreds here are being given
[02:11:28.057 --> 02:11:28.457]  Saline.
[02:11:28.477 --> 02:11:29.158]  It's on the bottle.
[02:11:29.178 --> 02:11:29.818]  They know the difference.
[02:11:30.098 --> 02:11:35.080]  And they're reportedly looking at laptops, looking at iPads to decide who gets what according to race.
[02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:36.121]  That's in the news now.
[02:11:36.701 --> 02:11:38.982]  There are now hundreds of witnesses that are reporting this.
[02:11:40.363 --> 02:11:43.704]  Well, I think Sherry Tenpenny gave you an excellent answer on this.
[02:11:44.124 --> 02:11:45.945]  I think she was on your show yesterday or the day before.
[02:11:46.646 --> 02:11:51.728]  And she's exactly right that they don't want to make it obvious that they're killing everybody all at once.
[02:11:52.384 --> 02:11:53.125]  And so they do.
[02:11:53.185 --> 02:11:56.628]  They inject some people with saline so they can claim, oh, look, it's safe.
[02:11:56.668 --> 02:11:57.669]  Those people are fine.
[02:11:58.309 --> 02:12:01.713]  But others get the spike protein injection, which is a biological weapon.
[02:12:02.173 --> 02:12:11.882]  But my understanding and my guess here is that as the booster shots roll out, the booster shots will become more and more aggressive in terms of their fatality.
[02:12:12.442 --> 02:12:19.767]  And anybody who is unwise enough to sign up for more booster shots is eventually going to be killed by this biological weapon.
[02:12:19.827 --> 02:12:24.931]  So remember, they have to keep the Delta variant mass hysteria in the media.
[02:12:25.051 --> 02:12:30.314]  And now, as you said, they have these response teams, which, let's just face it, we've got to call them Delta Force.
[02:12:30.975 --> 02:12:34.978]  They're like Delta Force government teams now, except they're not defending our country.
[02:12:35.618 --> 02:12:41.445]  They're killing humanity, and they're going to roll out and spread mass hysteria to make sure more people sign up for the booster shots.
[02:12:41.885 --> 02:12:43.647]  And that's where the real death wave kicks in.
[02:12:43.708 --> 02:12:52.377]  So we may only be months away from the real sharp explosion of mass death across America from these vaccines, Alex.
[02:12:52.938 --> 02:13:02.087]  We also have the VAERS report, and the different studies say 10, 50, 100 times more than what is actually reported, but the average is about 40, they say, is an accurate number.
[02:13:02.427 --> 02:13:11.036]  So if you've got 5,000, 6,000 deaths from the COVID vaccines here in the U.S., and it's 40 times 6,000, that is a gigantic number.
[02:13:11.056 --> 02:13:13.037]  They're banning these shots all over the world.
[02:13:13.058 --> 02:13:14.199]  And for people that ask, what is this?
[02:13:14.679 --> 02:13:16.221]  I believe this is the beta test.
[02:13:17.213 --> 02:13:22.595]  Still incredibly strong to see if we'll put up with all this death, all this disease, all these heart attacks.
[02:13:22.975 --> 02:13:27.656]  Now forcing them to put a warning like it's a pack of cigarettes on these injections.
[02:13:28.136 --> 02:13:32.558]  Is this the big push or is this just the beta for something bigger like you said the booster shots?
[02:13:33.547 --> 02:13:44.216]  Well, these are just the early days of the real extermination war against humanity because, as you said, VAERS is currently reporting over 6,000 deaths following COVID vaccinations.
[02:13:44.276 --> 02:13:50.702]  The real number, in my estimation, is at least 100,000 Americans have been killed by vaccines so far.
[02:13:50.742 --> 02:13:53.144]  It might be a couple hundred thousand, we just don't know for sure.
[02:13:53.564 --> 02:14:00.786]  And let's be clear, in the rat studies, six months they did at UT in 2012, Fauci paid for, killed most of the rats within six months.
[02:14:00.806 --> 02:14:03.407]  Well, in the life cycle, that's like three or four years in a human.
[02:14:03.827 --> 02:14:06.667]  And so we're going to see a lot more in the future, aren't we?
[02:14:07.628 --> 02:14:08.268]  Well, absolutely.
[02:14:08.488 --> 02:14:11.349]  And don't forget, there's something big that everybody's forgetting about this.
[02:14:11.789 --> 02:14:17.550]  Right now, under emergency use authorization, they are not allowed to mandate these vaccines.
[02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:19.931]  But once they get FDA approval,
[02:14:20.609 --> 02:14:21.389]  Keep going here, Mike.
[02:14:21.449 --> 02:14:26.291]  Tell us, when we come back, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor, what else is on your radar and what we can do.
[02:14:48.112 --> 02:14:48.352]  Okay.
[02:14:48.693 --> 02:14:52.979]  Well, it is clear this is a global extermination against humanity.
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:55.041]  It's in the early phases.
[02:14:55.102 --> 02:15:05.656]  It's going to accelerate, and they're going to combine multiple vectors of a grid-down collapse, an economic collapse, a second wave of biowarfare agents launched probably by Communist China.
[02:15:06.156 --> 02:15:23.275]  And I believe, based on my sources, once America is sufficiently weakened from within, with internal race wars, and perhaps a civil war if they can engineer that, and maybe nationwide gun confiscation attempts following a false flag attack, then the communists will literally invade the continental United States.
[02:15:23.755 --> 02:15:30.421]  Perhaps through UN troops or communist Chinese troops working with narco cartels across the southern border.
[02:15:30.441 --> 02:15:36.005]  And I've got numerous sources confirming all of this, including the pre-staging of weapons in the United States.
[02:15:36.466 --> 02:15:49.376]  So the American people are going to be fighting a multi-front war against invaders, against a rogue element of perhaps the military, and bioweapons, and a grid-down scenario all at the same time.
[02:15:49.416 --> 02:15:51.178]  This is all happening together by design.
[02:15:51.798 --> 02:15:54.020]  By the way, Mike, I 100% agree with you.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.462]  We'll explain why on the other side.
[02:15:55.482 --> 02:15:56.523]  I'm not trying to scare you, folks.
[02:15:56.883 --> 02:15:58.365]  We must mobilize now.
[02:15:58.445 --> 02:15:59.786]  This is the takedown of the U.S.
[02:16:00.187 --> 02:16:01.928]  This is the final minutes of the Republic.
[02:16:01.948 --> 02:16:02.329]  Stay with us.

[02:19:45.101 --> 02:19:48.142]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:19:48.162 --> 02:19:49.503]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.

[02:19:49.763 --> 02:19:50.643]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:09.512]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:10.052 --> 02:20:11.352]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:18.896 --> 02:20:29.920]  When the evening sun goes down, you will find me hanging around.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:33.342]  Nightlight
[02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:45.216]  You know, I'd like to go back to the old days, still at Open Free Society.
[02:20:46.518 --> 02:20:47.560]  But that's all ending.
[02:20:50.902 --> 02:20:55.244]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're witnessing unrestricted, undeclared warfare.
[02:20:55.764 --> 02:21:03.947]  21st century attack by major corporations to come in with big media and not tell you that they ordered the Texas power shut off in the official documents.
[02:21:04.467 --> 02:21:07.889]  Said no, you can't authorize to up your power for the storm.
[02:21:07.949 --> 02:21:09.930]  That was on record.
[02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:12.731]  Or they shut down the Keystone Pipeline or the Colonial.
[02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:14.291]  Those were all tests.
[02:21:15.172 --> 02:21:17.853]  And so when Mike Adams joining us earlier, back with us now,
[02:21:19.375 --> 02:21:21.457]  ...said this is the beginning of the main assault.
[02:21:21.617 --> 02:21:27.763]  This is the shutdown of the economy, the shutdown of the power grid, the collapse of all the major blue cities.
[02:21:30.498 --> 02:21:35.220]  A race war is the cover to then bring in the foreign UN troops under the Strong Cities Initiative.
[02:21:35.641 --> 02:21:36.861]  It's all official.
[02:21:37.481 --> 02:21:37.942]  It's here.
[02:21:38.202 --> 02:21:44.065]  And the Pentagon's saying, it's not China, it's not any foreign countries a threat, it's the American people.
[02:21:44.105 --> 02:21:45.645]  People that don't want lockdowns.
[02:21:46.126 --> 02:21:47.846]  People that don't want forced inoculations.
[02:21:48.107 --> 02:21:49.407]  People that question elections.
[02:21:51.408 --> 02:21:54.950]  Declaring us the enemy and spying on Tucker Carlson.
[02:21:57.372 --> 02:21:57.812]  It happened.
[02:21:58.513 --> 02:21:59.594]  We let them kill the babies.
[02:21:59.614 --> 02:22:00.775]  We let them do all the GMO.
[02:22:00.795 --> 02:22:01.355]  We let them do it all.
[02:22:01.636 --> 02:22:03.537]  And so they're going for broke now.
[02:22:04.018 --> 02:22:05.839]  And Klaus Schwab says we're going to censor the whole internet.
[02:22:05.859 --> 02:22:07.260]  We're going to take control of everybody.
[02:22:07.581 --> 02:22:09.542]  We're going to control things with corporate governance.
[02:22:09.763 --> 02:22:10.563]  What you can say and do.
[02:22:10.583 --> 02:22:12.265]  We're going to suppress medical treatments.
[02:22:14.136 --> 02:22:15.397]  Still pay insufficient attention.
[02:22:39.172 --> 02:22:55.702]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[02:22:56.642 --> 02:23:05.308]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[02:23:06.584 --> 02:23:08.826]  To a major cyber attack.
[02:23:09.766 --> 02:23:19.133]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cyber.
[02:23:20.396 --> 02:23:32.846]  So, he says he wants to know people, he wants to cut carbon, he said COVID helped us do less, now he says, oh, a big power outage is coming, oh, it's going to be so terrible, so he'll be the hero once that happens.
[02:23:32.866 --> 02:23:36.569]  Mike Adams, this is all scripted, it's all prepared, it's all happening now, what do we do?
[02:23:38.078 --> 02:23:53.411]  See, when he talks about this coming cyber grid attack, you know, he's saying it licking his lips, you know, with a sense of joy, with a sense of knowing that this is what's coming, the same way Fauci warned that Trump was going to have to deal with a biological weapons attack.
[02:23:53.451 --> 02:23:55.273]  They know it's coming because they're engineering it.
[02:23:55.813 --> 02:24:02.479]  But I want to bring people's attention to a really important metaphor in all of this, that condo collapse in Miami.
[02:24:03.289 --> 02:24:07.373]  And of course, my prayers go out to all the innocent victims of that collapse.
[02:24:07.393 --> 02:24:10.796]  But there was one woman who I believe lived on the 7th floor.
[02:24:11.437 --> 02:24:15.221]  She ran out of the building because she heard a sound.
[02:24:15.881 --> 02:24:16.482]  She got up.
[02:24:16.842 --> 02:24:18.544]  It was like 2 or 3 in the morning when this happened.
[02:24:18.564 --> 02:24:22.868]  She got up and she saw a giant crack appear in the wall.
[02:24:23.289 --> 02:24:26.672]  A crack that she said was two fingers wide in terms of its gap.
[02:24:27.072 --> 02:24:33.274]  And she heard sounds, and her balcony door would no longer shut because the geometry of the doorway had shifted.
[02:24:33.754 --> 02:24:36.374]  She immediately realized, hey, I've got to get out.
[02:24:36.955 --> 02:24:40.536]  Something's not right with this, and she ran down seven flights, and she got out.
[02:24:41.016 --> 02:24:43.296]  She survived, and the building collapsed behind her.
[02:24:43.376 --> 02:24:46.077]  Now, why is this important to understand?
[02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:49.498]  Because right now, Alex, your viewers, my listeners,
[02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:56.776]  Those are the people who are seeing the signs of the collapse that is about to accelerate at the speed of gravity here.
[02:24:56.956 --> 02:24:57.517]  I totally agree.
[02:24:57.577 --> 02:25:03.803]  It's a metaphor, like Deepwater Horizon was, or this, of the collapse that's already begun.
[02:25:04.063 --> 02:25:06.566]  The cracks are already there, the door is already crooked.
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:18.429]  Yes, and for those who are wise enough to see what's happening and to then adjust, adapt, escape this problem or be prepared, they will be the survivors.
[02:25:18.729 --> 02:25:26.176]  Well, most people did not survive because they never saw the signs or they were asleep and it happened during their sleep hours.
[02:25:26.477 --> 02:25:31.902]  But for those who are willing to pay attention, you can see what's about to happen and all of your viewers can see it.
[02:25:32.302 --> 02:25:38.327]  And tell us the order of how you believe they implode us and then invade us as quote saviors, quote International I-44s.
[02:25:39.027 --> 02:25:40.849]  Describe how the dominoes fall.
[02:25:41.449 --> 02:25:46.093]  Could be next week, could be six months from now, but you can see this is the imminent modern attack.
[02:25:46.353 --> 02:25:47.314]  We are under attack.
[02:25:47.394 --> 02:25:48.755]  America is falling right now.
[02:25:49.596 --> 02:25:58.303]  Well, one thing that's clear to me is that they won't launch the land invasion of the continental United States until they believe they have confiscated some significant portion of the firearms.
[02:25:58.823 --> 02:26:01.085]  So the sequence that I see... So the race war will precede that?
[02:26:02.068 --> 02:26:02.568]  Exactly.
[02:26:02.948 --> 02:26:04.469]  They're going to try to launch a race war.
[02:26:04.489 --> 02:26:10.690]  They're going to pull off a false flag event, try to blame, of course, the gun owners and Trump supporters and Christians and so on.
[02:26:11.310 --> 02:26:16.671]  They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns, which I believe people will not comply.
[02:26:16.691 --> 02:26:23.753]  That would be insane at this point with the police being defunded and violent crime exploding, you know, all across liberal cities everywhere.
[02:26:23.793 --> 02:26:26.514]  People need self-defense more than ever, including, by the way, women.
[02:26:27.934 --> 02:26:35.462]  And people of color and also gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns more than ever before right now.
[02:26:35.502 --> 02:26:37.924]  So it's the left that's buying guns more than ever.
[02:26:37.964 --> 02:26:42.689]  So it's going to make gun control very difficult among left-wing legislators.
[02:26:42.949 --> 02:26:46.072]  So they're going to try to push a false flag and they're going to try to take the guns.
[02:26:46.733 --> 02:26:51.878]  If we, the American people, if we surrender our guns, I believe we will be invaded.
[02:26:53.039 --> 02:27:07.975]  It's confirmed by the Canadian military now that Chinese troops are massing in Canada.
[02:27:08.275 --> 02:27:11.339]  Canada is under martial law, so we don't let people go outside, they might talk.
[02:27:11.719 --> 02:27:14.202]  And hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops, bare minimum, are massing.
[02:27:15.265 --> 02:27:16.126]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[02:27:16.146 --> 02:27:34.667]  They're massing in the North, in Canada, but the larger movement will, I believe, come from the South, because for many years, and I've confirmed this with numerous sources, Communist Chinese military generals have been training narco-cartel troops, and you know they have the armored vehicles, they've got the routes,
[02:27:34.667 --> 02:27:34.867]  It's
[02:27:52.432 --> 02:27:54.873]  You will be invaded and you will be slaughtered.
[02:27:55.353 --> 02:28:00.895]  This is not just about defending the right for self-defense against a tyrannical government.
[02:28:01.276 --> 02:28:03.797]  This is about defending the nation against foreign invaders.
[02:28:04.317 --> 02:28:05.337]  Mike, you're totally right.
[02:28:05.377 --> 02:28:07.798]  We're in the climate of a takedown.
[02:28:08.478 --> 02:28:14.661]  They're not going to just launch a bio-attack through vaccines that kills tens of millions and then let us get mad and take the government back.
[02:28:15.021 --> 02:28:20.023]  You only do that as a preparatory phase to soften everyone up ahead of an even bigger attack.
[02:28:20.283 --> 02:28:21.924]  The attacks are going to get exponential.
[02:28:23.376 --> 02:28:24.016]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:24.096 --> 02:28:36.122]  And then add in a grid down scenario where you lose the basic infrastructure of functioning American communities and add in a potential financial collapse and race wars and possible EMP weapons.
[02:28:36.162 --> 02:28:38.263]  I mean, this is a total takedown.
[02:28:38.303 --> 02:28:38.783]  It's coming.
[02:28:39.203 --> 02:28:43.105]  We've got to plan to be able to survive and defend our nation off grid.
[02:28:44.025 --> 02:28:44.545]  Off grid.
[02:28:44.705 --> 02:28:48.007]  And I think you agree it's going to be before the midterms they try to fully take the U.S.
[02:28:48.027 --> 02:28:48.187]  down?
[02:28:49.266 --> 02:28:50.388]  That's what it seems like, yes.
[02:28:50.748 --> 02:28:54.234]  Although there may be delays in their plan, but that's their intention.
[02:29:05.754 --> 02:29:17.508]  I came up with this idea a few weeks ago, I guess about a month ago, but we had a snafu getting this because we've been using the same bumper sticker company for about 15 years and I had an idea of Rainstorm and I said, I want these bumper stickers made.
[02:29:17.588 --> 02:29:21.773]  I'm going to sell them at cost in his bumper sticker activist pack to get the word out.
[02:29:21.933 --> 02:29:22.494]  And here they are.
[02:29:22.674 --> 02:29:23.955]  Going into space!
[02:29:24.035 --> 02:29:24.555]  Mathematics!
[02:29:24.575 --> 02:29:25.495]  Quantum mechanics!
[02:29:25.535 --> 02:29:27.376]  The secrets of the universe!
[02:29:27.477 --> 02:29:28.097]  It's all there!
[02:29:28.117 --> 02:29:28.737]  Life is fiery with
[02:29:49.968 --> 02:29:51.690]  Do you see this bumper sticker of your TV?
[02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:53.191]  Notice it looks a little different.
[02:29:53.211 --> 02:29:54.332]  It's printed a little bit different.
[02:29:54.712 --> 02:29:57.034]  It's a front peeler, not a back peeler, and all the others aren't.
[02:29:57.854 --> 02:30:01.117]  And we always have high-quality stuff, so these stickers are better than this one.
[02:30:01.137 --> 02:30:01.617]  You notice that?
[02:30:02.038 --> 02:30:05.280]  We have a high-quality supplier with, you know, the best, thickest, best, stickiest ones.
[02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:06.021]  They last the longest.
[02:30:06.161 --> 02:30:07.682]  These are high-end bumper stickers.
[02:30:07.702 --> 02:30:09.203]  This is a piece of junk.
[02:30:09.303 --> 02:30:09.824]  But you know what?
[02:30:09.924 --> 02:30:14.127]  It has more value than all these, because the place that did it just got my business.
[02:30:14.167 --> 02:30:17.170]  I'm gonna try to get them to upgrade their printing, because they are for free speech.
[02:30:17.310 --> 02:30:18.671]  It went all the way to the owner of the company,
[02:30:18.951 --> 02:30:29.218]  And the company we've used for 15 years said we will not print masks are for slaves and criminals because they had the people in there on their floor wearing masks and they thought I was insulting them calling them slaves.
[02:30:29.818 --> 02:30:32.540]  Isn't that the perfect microcosm of Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:30:33.121 --> 02:30:37.684]  You're being enslaved by the UN, a global medical cartel, Fauci and Gates that want you dead on record.
[02:30:37.844 --> 02:30:40.245]  They're doing all of this, and then you see a bumper sticker.
[02:30:40.265 --> 02:30:45.648]  They told us about a third of their crew threatened to quit because they thought they were being called slaves because they were wearing masks.
[02:30:45.688 --> 02:30:46.769]  Well, you are a slave.
[02:30:46.989 --> 02:30:49.310]  You've been bullied into wearing a mask that doesn't protect you.
[02:30:49.551 --> 02:30:50.111]  It's a cult.
[02:30:50.331 --> 02:30:51.552]  You're muzzled.
[02:30:51.792 --> 02:30:55.474]  Hell, they've got laws against muzzling prisoners federally and at the state level.
[02:30:55.654 --> 02:30:57.435]  Unless they're spitting and biting people, you can't do that.
[02:30:57.695 --> 02:31:00.397]  There's laws you can't do it to people on death row.
[02:31:00.557 --> 02:31:03.819]  So I'm saying, masks are for criminals covering their face and slaves.
[02:31:04.019 --> 02:31:04.779]  They wouldn't print it.
[02:31:04.919 --> 02:31:05.880]  Oh, well, how about this then?
[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:07.581]  Are for slaves?
[02:31:07.601 --> 02:31:08.261]  How about that?
[02:31:08.282 --> 02:31:11.864]  And if you were wearing chains, would you get mad at me and say, well, he's calling me a slave!
[02:31:12.144 --> 02:31:13.205]  Yeah, you've been enslaved!
[02:31:13.425 --> 02:31:14.106]  You're a captain!
[02:31:14.126 --> 02:31:14.927]  You're wearing chains!
[02:31:14.967 --> 02:31:16.168]  Just like wearing a gag!
[02:31:16.308 --> 02:31:18.970]  Just like wearing a face covering to dehumanize you!
[02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:23.293]  So you can find the sticker pack at infowarestore.com, and we're selling them at cost.
[02:31:23.433 --> 02:31:27.657]  By the way, you can get all these stickers for $9.95 with in-game at the same price.
[02:31:27.677 --> 02:31:30.639]  You get in-game for $9.95 to film, you get all the stickers with that order.
[02:31:32.662 --> 02:31:44.428]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[02:31:44.688 --> 02:31:51.472]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[02:31:51.772 --> 02:31:53.693]  Their first product they are launching is called
[02:31:53.973 --> 02:31:58.877]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[02:31:58.957 --> 02:32:03.541]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[02:32:03.761 --> 02:32:05.483]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[02:32:05.723 --> 02:32:14.871]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[02:32:15.051 --> 02:32:19.533]  Bioseptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[02:32:19.854 --> 02:32:23.676]  Visit TheBiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[02:32:23.996 --> 02:32:25.677]  That's TheBiopros.com.
[02:32:26.017 --> 02:32:30.019]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled.
[02:32:30.179 --> 02:32:31.020]  TheBiopros.com.
[02:33:05.481 --> 02:33:09.582]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:10.122 --> 02:33:11.423]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.585 --> 02:33:23.507]  Mom is the bar where the Beach Boys would go.
[02:33:24.647 --> 02:33:27.788]  Dennis' last stop before Kokomo.
[02:33:30.461 --> 02:33:37.126]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:37.506 --> 02:33:43.451]  I want to be 100% clear with our listeners and viewers.
[02:33:47.076 --> 02:33:48.776]  I'm not saying all this to be sensational.
[02:33:49.437 --> 02:33:57.539]  They have given experimental vaccines that we know Fauci tested at the UT Level 4 weapons lab that killed almost all the mice and rats they tested it on.
[02:33:58.459 --> 02:34:06.381]  They knew before they put this out it would cause heart attacks, it would cause bleeding in the brain, and it's happened.
[02:34:07.181 --> 02:34:10.342]  And now they're trying to cover that up, and the death rate's off the charts.
[02:34:10.402 --> 02:34:15.223]  So, when you hit your own country with something of that level,
[02:34:17.193 --> 02:34:21.934]  You're only doing it because you plan to do something even worse that'll distract folks from that.
[02:34:21.954 --> 02:34:25.274]  Then the next attack will be even bigger.
[02:34:25.294 --> 02:34:26.915]  So we're asking, what is the big attack?
[02:34:27.235 --> 02:34:31.475]  You read about history, you hear about times with millions dead, wars and starving and death.
[02:34:32.536 --> 02:34:34.196]  That's when countries didn't agree with each other.
[02:34:34.436 --> 02:34:40.377]  We have a global corporate system playing countries off against each other, bringing in a nightmare program.
[02:34:41.457 --> 02:34:42.697]  And so the sky's the limit.
[02:34:42.797 --> 02:34:46.258]  What do we do, Mike Adams, to telegraph to the deep state
[02:34:47.563 --> 02:35:00.068]  Uh, you know, to the George Soros's and the New World Order types that they're not going to get away with this because they have really set loose the fires of race war and division and collapse.
[02:35:00.108 --> 02:35:09.172]  They've already, the lockdowns already caused the third world to collapse and massive migrant waves the UN is using as a political and economic and cultural and military weapon.
[02:35:09.732 --> 02:35:10.833]  I mean, the big picture.
[02:35:11.573 --> 02:35:12.734]  The world's on fire!
[02:35:12.794 --> 02:35:13.915]  The world's disintegrating!
[02:35:14.195 --> 02:35:16.096]  Blue cities by design are imploding!
[02:35:16.537 --> 02:35:18.398]  Not just here, but all over the world they're doing this!
[02:35:19.339 --> 02:35:21.760]  How do you see them playing this out, and how do we counter it?
[02:35:22.901 --> 02:35:33.109]  Well, let me be clear, and I know this is going to sound odd, but long term I'm an optimist in how this plays out, because, well, for the following reasons, and plus we have God on our side.
[02:35:33.669 --> 02:35:40.454]  But in the short term, I believe the globalists will succeed in mass murdering at least a billion human beings on our planet today,
[02:35:41.292 --> 02:35:41.812]  Maybe more.
[02:35:42.332 --> 02:35:45.373]  They will succeed in taking down the America that we once knew.
[02:35:45.393 --> 02:35:55.816]  I believe the Republic will fall, but it will be reborn by the survivors and the rebuilders, who are the people, the kind of people that watch this very show.
[02:35:56.396 --> 02:36:05.338]  And the reason is because the globalists, in order for them to succeed long-term, they have to achieve a near 99% extermination, and they won't.
[02:36:06.118 --> 02:36:07.179]  They may exterminate 25,
[02:36:09.307 --> 02:36:09.747]  100%?
[02:36:09.347 --> 02:36:09.747]  Maybe even 50%!
[02:36:25.714 --> 02:36:30.418]  Yes, they've initiated the war, but they've already failed in the long run because so many people are aware of it.
[02:36:30.878 --> 02:36:34.120]  They did not succeed in silencing every voice of truth.
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:37.603]  They did not succeed, although they tried desperately, especially with Infowars.
[02:36:38.263 --> 02:36:45.289]  But the other thing is that the answer for those of us who are going to rebuild a new society rooted in principles of liberty
[02:36:46.250 --> 02:36:49.193]  The new America, as I call it.
[02:36:49.313 --> 02:36:54.799]  All we've got to do is survive this engineered collapse, which means we've got to be prepared.
[02:36:55.219 --> 02:37:01.346]  We've got to be ready for no power grid for six months or a year, no food supplies for a year or longer, and so on.
[02:37:01.766 --> 02:37:06.131]  We've got to be prepared, and mentally prepared as well, for what's coming.
[02:37:07.116 --> 02:37:13.864]  Once we make it through that, and I'm not saying it's going to be easy, a lot of lives will be lost, families will be destroyed, you know, it's going to be hell.
[02:37:14.425 --> 02:37:23.818]  But if we get through that, then we will succeed in rebuilding society and defeating the globalist agenda, because at that point, they will have nowhere left to hide.
[02:37:24.218 --> 02:37:26.480]  And by the way, Mike, we're not just saying this.
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:28.101]  All the globalists explained to them.
[02:37:28.481 --> 02:37:29.662]  We told people this 10 years ago.
[02:37:29.702 --> 02:37:31.523]  Now it's in all the New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:37:31.944 --> 02:37:33.125]  They've got armored redoubts.
[02:37:33.165 --> 02:37:34.105]  They've run to New Zealand.
[02:37:34.125 --> 02:37:34.926]  They've run to Kauai.
[02:37:34.946 --> 02:37:35.927]  They've run to Tasmania.
[02:37:36.247 --> 02:37:37.868]  They've run up to Northern Canada.
[02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:39.990]  They're all digging in and leaving and hiding.
[02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.111]  I mean, they've done this.
[02:37:41.151 --> 02:37:41.851]  They've triggered this.
[02:37:42.151 --> 02:37:43.212]  We're not trying to be negative.
[02:37:43.232 --> 02:37:44.233]  We're not trying to scare people.
[02:37:44.473 --> 02:37:46.975]  They've initiated the damn collapse of the planet.
[02:37:47.655 --> 02:37:48.536]  It's so horrible.
[02:37:48.776 --> 02:37:49.537]  It's just horrible.
[02:37:50.738 --> 02:37:52.439]  And, you know, realize that
[02:37:53.634 --> 02:37:55.736]  Preparing is not just about self-defense.
[02:37:56.116 --> 02:37:59.759]  It's not just about defending your life or your family or your community or even your nation.
[02:38:00.119 --> 02:38:06.403]  At this point, preparedness is the most important pro-human activity in which you can engage.
[02:38:06.984 --> 02:38:09.746]  And I'm really trying to emphasize with people in my own work
[02:38:10.286 --> 02:38:13.048]  About being ready for off-grid situations.
[02:38:13.148 --> 02:38:22.092]  So, this is not a commercial plug for any company I know, but just have a solar, you know, power bank, a solar generator as it's sometimes called.
[02:38:22.132 --> 02:38:26.415]  Have a way to gather solar energy, store it in a device so you can charge yourself up.
[02:38:26.435 --> 02:38:30.337]  For five years it's, I better be off the grid, I better have everything, I better get ready.
[02:38:30.357 --> 02:38:35.880]  And I'm not even myself ready because I'm so busy fighting up on the front lines, but I mean, absolutely, you can see this.
[02:38:36.857 --> 02:38:37.918]  Yeah, no, I know the feeling.
[02:38:37.959 --> 02:38:38.920]  I have the same conundrum.
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.607]  It's like, how much should I spend, how much time doing videos and helping others versus doing my own preparedness, right?
[02:38:44.888 --> 02:38:53.058]  So we all, we try to balance this, but everybody's got to be ready to operate off-grid, which means off-grid food, off-grid food preservation.
[02:38:54.019 --> 02:39:00.923]  Off-grid, being able to charge small electronic devices, such as a night vision device, you know, for security, or a radio.
[02:39:00.943 --> 02:39:05.106]  Let's talk about what it's going to look like if they do a three-month power grid off.
[02:39:05.486 --> 02:39:09.288]  That'll create irrevocable problems, 50 times worse than the COVID lockdown.
[02:39:09.328 --> 02:39:12.530]  You'll have just masses of burning cities, starving people.
[02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:14.972]  It'll look like a zombie apocalypse within two weeks.
[02:39:16.052 --> 02:39:21.916]  It will absolutely be a zombie apocalypse, and there will be mass migrations out of the cities for those who can survive the trek.
[02:39:22.481 --> 02:39:29.863]  Now, cities like Los Angeles, being that there's so much desert to the east of L.A., there won't be that many survivors who can walk out on foot from Los Angeles.
[02:39:30.423 --> 02:39:30.583]  L.A.
[02:39:30.603 --> 02:39:32.523]  will be turned into a massive death zone.
[02:39:33.423 --> 02:39:39.385]  It seems to have already begun with some of the videos I've seen with the massive homeless camps, the trash everywhere.
[02:39:39.785 --> 02:39:42.705]  It's a city in collapse, but that's going to happen in Chicago.
[02:39:42.745 --> 02:39:44.866]  It's going to happen in Miami, in Houston.
[02:39:45.086 --> 02:39:46.187]  See Mike, people don't get it.
[02:39:46.287 --> 02:39:49.470]  Civilization with our top engineers was hard to continue.
[02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:54.054]  Once the globalists made us decadent and evil and started shutting it down, it will collapse.
[02:39:54.454 --> 02:39:55.315]  They've initiated it.
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:40:03.823]  Yeah, we're going to have a combination, I say, of I Am Legend with Will Smith and Idiocracy with Mike Judge.
[02:40:03.883 --> 02:40:08.425]  So we're going to have legendary idiocracy, basically, all across America.
[02:40:08.845 --> 02:40:13.727]  Just mass death, mass collapse, people who are unprepared, clueless, have no idea what to do.
[02:40:14.288 --> 02:40:17.089]  And then you're going to have this small contingent of survivors.
[02:40:17.689 --> 02:40:23.817]  Who are the veterans, you know, former law enforcement, retired cops, preppers, people who watch this show.
[02:40:24.237 --> 02:40:26.320]  These are the people who are going to be the survivors.
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:28.803]  We're going to have a mass die-off in the United States.
[02:40:28.823 --> 02:40:30.024]  There's no question in my mind.
[02:40:30.044 --> 02:40:33.768]  And I mean tens of millions of people will die because of what's being engineered.
[02:40:34.169 --> 02:40:36.532]  Without a power grid, every major city collapses.
[02:40:36.952 --> 02:40:45.581]  And you'll have a 70-80% fatality rate in those cities, even according to government reports on the aftereffects of the EMT weapons.
[02:40:45.621 --> 02:40:52.208]  And so they're just starting the euthanasia, because by the time there's a full collapse, no one will notice why everybody's dying, because it'll just be no food anyways.
[02:40:53.447 --> 02:41:05.978]  Yes, I think they also know that when the collapse comes, there'll be very limited resources and they're trying to pre-exterminate as many people as possible so that those people aren't taking the food supplies that a lot of these Democrat governors have squirreled away.
[02:41:06.018 --> 02:41:14.626]  And they're testing the media to detect, if you'll cover up treatments for viruses, and if you'll cover up mothers that kids die, you'll cover up anything during what's about to happen.
[02:41:14.666 --> 02:41:15.587]  There's all this to test.
[02:41:16.772 --> 02:41:24.040]  Yeah, I know, but what's fascinating is the relevance of media and even the internet will be obsolete when the grid goes down.
[02:41:24.060 --> 02:41:27.604]  I mean, think about it, folks, there will be no functioning internet for this period of time.
[02:41:28.004 --> 02:41:34.571]  Not forever, but as the grid is down, there's no internet, there's no media, there's not even cryptocurrency when the grid's down, see?
[02:41:34.992 --> 02:41:38.876]  So you've got to have backup plans, you've got to have food, you've got to have super
[02:41:39.036 --> 02:41:44.761]  They're all going to have the money prepositioned, guard their facilities during the collapse that wipes out all their competition.
[02:41:45.041 --> 02:41:47.543]  Then once they turn the power back on, they'll be the last people standing.
[02:41:48.524 --> 02:41:52.627]  Well, I think there's no doubt that all the retailers are going to be looted very, very quickly.
[02:41:52.827 --> 02:41:56.410]  Some may have a defense, as you mentioned, and they may be able to hold out for some period of time.
[02:41:56.770 --> 02:42:06.778]  But once the starvation spectrum kicks in, you know, when people reach famine, their behavior shifts quite dramatically and they drop any pretense of polite interaction in society.
[02:42:06.798 --> 02:42:08.480]  Humans become psychotic murdering machines.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:09.280]  Absolutely.
[02:42:09.981 --> 02:42:10.421]  You said it.
[02:42:10.501 --> 02:42:11.641]  Psychotic murdering machines.
[02:42:11.661 --> 02:42:13.262]  Or zombies, as we say.
[02:42:13.602 --> 02:42:14.222]  And that's coming.
[02:42:14.443 --> 02:42:15.443]  That's absolutely coming.
[02:42:15.743 --> 02:42:16.884]  The shortages are real.
[02:42:16.924 --> 02:42:17.744]  The food shortages.
[02:42:17.784 --> 02:42:19.785]  You've probably seen it in your commercial operations.
[02:42:19.845 --> 02:42:20.425]  I know I have.
[02:42:20.905 --> 02:42:21.786]  The shortages are real.
[02:42:22.026 --> 02:42:23.126]  Supply lines are collapsing.
[02:42:23.146 --> 02:42:24.767]  I was talking to Norm Pattis in Connecticut.
[02:42:24.807 --> 02:42:26.408]  He said the store shelves are half bare.
[02:42:27.353 --> 02:42:28.674]  I'm not surprised.
[02:42:29.294 --> 02:42:37.517]  Yeah, it's going to get way worse, and they are intentionally shutting down food production by using COVID as an excuse in many cases.
[02:42:37.797 --> 02:42:40.978]  And also, transportation lines are completely maxed out.
[02:42:41.218 --> 02:42:43.639]  They can't get enough truck drivers, trains, ships, anything.
[02:42:43.979 --> 02:42:45.419]  So, it's coming, folks.
[02:42:45.579 --> 02:42:47.960]  They threw a snarl into the whole supply chain.
[02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:50.081]  Meanwhile, Gates is buying up all the farmland.
[02:42:50.441 --> 02:42:51.581]  Four on the other side of this.
[02:42:52.902 --> 02:42:53.582]  You're exactly right.
[02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:56.212]  Mike Adams' most powerful interview ever with you.
[02:42:56.252 --> 02:42:59.575]  Let's come back and talk about more solutions we've given folks to bad news.
[02:42:59.875 --> 02:43:01.416]  Let's talk about survival straight ahead.
[02:43:02.577 --> 02:43:04.258]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[02:43:04.298 --> 02:43:05.279]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:43:05.299 --> 02:43:06.519]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:43:06.579 --> 02:43:09.441]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to, and Joe Rogan, Elon Musk?
[02:43:09.581 --> 02:43:10.662]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:43:10.862 --> 02:43:11.503]  They tune in right here.
[02:43:15.572 --> 02:43:16.273]  InfoWars.
[02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:18.255]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:43:18.275 --> 02:43:24.161]  I've got a proposal for viewers and listeners that is one of the most important proposals you'll ever get in your life.
[02:43:24.621 --> 02:43:28.726]  I know how good it works because I finally listened to Dr. Edward Grubb.
[02:43:29.810 --> 02:43:35.211]  Seven, eight years ago, when he said to me, Alex, you're exercising a lot, but you're overweight.
[02:43:35.971 --> 02:43:38.512]  You probably have a deficiency in high quality iodine.
[02:43:38.552 --> 02:43:41.412]  Most iodine is bound into the soil or into the food.
[02:43:41.532 --> 02:43:42.352]  You're not absorbing it.
[02:43:42.392 --> 02:43:44.333]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[02:43:44.353 --> 02:43:53.354]  He showed me articles where the UN admits that 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities and lower IQ because of low iodine in utero and after they were born and as adults.
[02:43:53.474 --> 02:43:58.455]  And so I finally started taking deep earth crystal iodine, but he was the only guy to ever actually go out
[02:43:58.635 --> 02:43:59.475]  Well, we have it today.
[02:43:59.515 --> 02:44:00.336]  And that's Survival Shield X2.
[02:44:00.356 --> 02:44:02.437]  Survival Shield X2 is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[02:44:02.497 --> 02:44:03.957]  It's 100% Deep Earth Crystal True Nascent Iodine.
[02:44:18.203 --> 02:44:22.005]  But then we developed, working with other scientists, X3.
[02:44:22.465 --> 02:44:24.666]  Now, I'm not saying X2 is better than X3.
[02:44:24.726 --> 02:44:26.446]  They're apples and oranges.
[02:44:26.526 --> 02:44:33.089]  And we have X2 at 50% off in stock with free shipping right now, part of our 4th of July Super Sale.
[02:44:33.109 --> 02:44:38.671]  But I was able to get in a bigger order of X3 because it's become a big seller over the years.
[02:44:38.811 --> 02:44:47.355]  It's got the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine with two other types of clean, good iodine that are better for some people than just one type of iodine.
[02:44:47.515 --> 02:44:54.540]  Some people can't absorb the pure iodine, the atomic iodine, and they need the other types of naturally occurring iodine.
[02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:59.123]  This has all three, so it's apples and it's oranges.
[02:44:59.184 --> 02:45:01.185]  It's not, is an apple better or is an orange better?
[02:45:01.905 --> 02:45:04.367]  Or is a potato better or a tomato better?
[02:45:04.467 --> 02:45:06.969]  Or are black grapes better than green grapes?
[02:45:07.109 --> 02:45:09.211]  Or is this type of squash better than that squash?
[02:45:09.571 --> 02:45:11.932]  Two different things, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:12.033 --> 02:45:16.055]  I liken it to regular yellow gold being gold, and you have white gold.
[02:45:16.175 --> 02:45:17.896]  It's gold, it's just silver-looking.
[02:45:17.976 --> 02:45:24.020]  I mean, it's very similar, but it's two different things at the molecular level, and that's just my goofy way of breaking it down.
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:28.322]  So, I want to challenge listeners, and I want to challenge viewers to support the broadcast.
[02:45:28.402 --> 02:45:31.344]  Hell, go to infowarstore.com, right in the middle section right there.
[02:45:31.384 --> 02:45:35.267]  You can become a sponsor and make a one-time gift of $10, $50, $100 to fund us.
[02:45:35.327 --> 02:45:39.169]  That way, after credit card fees and stuff, we get about 95% of it to actually fund
[02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:42.451]  What we're doing, if you make a $5 donation, we get over $4 of it.
[02:45:42.551 --> 02:45:50.194]  With the products, we only get a fraction of that, because obviously we gotta pay for the shipping, and the handling, and the crew, and the infrastructure, and the cost of the product.
[02:45:50.235 --> 02:46:00.159]  So what I'm saying is, we can't do this without you, and we've got really, really, really great products that will empower you and your family at the very same time.
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.221]  And those are X2 and X3.
[02:46:03.581 --> 02:46:08.844]  If you don't know about the bad halogens, fluoride, bromide, chlorine, there's a whole list of them,
[02:46:09.244 --> 02:46:15.449]  They hurt you, they give you cancer, they take over your thyroid, they take over your hypothalamus, they attack your organs.
[02:46:16.050 --> 02:46:23.016]  And if your body doesn't have iodine, it will absorb the bad halogens that Big Brother and the New World Order make sure in everything we do.
[02:46:23.476 --> 02:46:26.039]  In all these products, in all the plastics, in the water.
[02:46:26.599 --> 02:46:31.141]  So, the good part about having this iodine is it blocks those and pulls those out of the body.
[02:46:31.201 --> 02:46:43.265]  So, for adults, for children, for everybody, you need these iodine products, X2 and X3, 50 and 60% off respectively, with free shipping, double Patriot points, through July 4th, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:46:43.305 --> 02:46:44.525]  So, don't procrastinate.
[02:46:44.585 --> 02:46:49.427]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com now and order X2 and X3 and some of the other great products.
[02:46:49.507 --> 02:46:50.527]  Thank you all for your support.

[02:47:05.484 --> 02:47:11.392]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.090 --> 02:47:26.752]  All right, Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com is our guest.
[02:47:27.452 --> 02:47:28.293]  He's dead on.
[02:47:29.834 --> 02:47:31.955]  This is a real analysis.
[02:47:32.336 --> 02:47:37.079]  You see times in history where civilizations, societies, commit suicide.
[02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:39.721]  And it's being done again.
[02:47:39.741 --> 02:47:47.066]  It's a very dangerous move by the ruling class, but they really believe that the Earth's overpopulated and they're saving people, you know, saving themselves.
[02:47:47.106 --> 02:47:50.428]  But at the end of the day, they're really psychotics.
[02:47:52.543 --> 02:47:55.386]  Mike, why would they try such a reckless move?
[02:47:55.927 --> 02:47:58.269]  Is it because their whole pedophile network was being exposed?
[02:47:58.289 --> 02:47:59.830]  Globalism was being challenged?
[02:47:59.851 --> 02:48:01.072]  We knew they had this on the shelf.
[02:48:01.492 --> 02:48:02.193]  They'd written about it.
[02:48:02.233 --> 02:48:04.695]  They talked about it in all those different documents like lockstep.
[02:48:05.416 --> 02:48:06.597]  But now they're doing it.
[02:48:06.617 --> 02:48:14.566]  I mean, this is just, we now know for sure the super bold move to give somebody a vaccine doesn't protect you from COVID.
[02:48:15.146 --> 02:48:18.729]  And gives you blood clots all over your body and grows crystals in your brain.
[02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:23.014]  I mean, just, and of course, because they want to hit us.
[02:48:23.074 --> 02:48:25.035]  Everybody's dying once the collapse hits.
[02:48:25.616 --> 02:48:28.779]  And it'll just make it a hundred times worse because your family will be dying around you.
[02:48:29.239 --> 02:48:29.980]  I mean, this is it.
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.762]  People need to know this is the genocide.
[02:48:32.202 --> 02:48:35.325]  Well, you've hit upon something really important, so yes, the election of Trump.
[02:48:52.406 --> 02:48:52.947]  I don't think so.
[02:49:11.088 --> 02:49:11.769]  We're good to go.
[02:49:34.065 --> 02:49:44.311]  So the fact that you and I are on the air right now, the fact that Tucker Carlson is on the air, this is going to be the downfall because they can't cover up the truth like they had planned.
[02:49:44.652 --> 02:49:51.116]  They needed about five more years to take everybody offline and then they could roll this out and there would be no dissenting views.
[02:49:51.596 --> 02:49:55.939]  But again, because of Trump's victory and the populist uprising, they had to accelerate that.
[02:49:56.059 --> 02:49:57.259]  I 100% agree with that analysis.
[02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:00.761]  Yes, they even admit they accelerated their plan.
[02:50:00.801 --> 02:50:01.762]  We forced them to.
[02:50:02.102 --> 02:50:06.343]  So as bad as it is, they'll only be able to kill 20% of the world population instead of 90.
[02:50:07.044 --> 02:50:11.986]  And in the end, once now the people know it's an attack, they can't stop the attack once they launch it.
[02:50:12.266 --> 02:50:14.927]  It'll generate total rebellion and their annihilation in the end.
[02:50:15.267 --> 02:50:19.729]  The question is, are they crazy enough to start a nuclear war to try to get rid of this even faster?
[02:50:21.244 --> 02:50:22.005]  Well, perhaps.
[02:50:22.426 --> 02:50:27.791]  I believe it's possible that they may use nuclear weapons to strike military targets in the United States.
[02:50:27.851 --> 02:50:37.061]  But let's remember that the globalists, ultimately, they want America's food-producing farmland, especially for communist China that can't produce a sufficient food supply.
[02:50:37.121 --> 02:50:40.505]  And that's why the Chinese agent Gates is buying it all up.
[02:50:41.770 --> 02:50:50.139]  Well, exactly right, and this is also why bioweapons that target specifically human tissue were one of the priority weapons, because it doesn't destroy the farmland.
[02:50:50.519 --> 02:50:57.867]  In fact, the ACE2 receptor targets for the spike protein, which are in the vaccines, they don't even harm animals.
[02:50:57.947 --> 02:50:58.788]  It's only humans.
[02:50:59.129 --> 02:51:01.331]  It's targeted to humans so they can kill off the American people.
[02:51:01.351 --> 02:51:03.173]  It's a biological neutron bomb.
[02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:04.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:51:04.810 --> 02:51:05.991]  That's a good way to say it.
[02:51:06.071 --> 02:51:06.872]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:51:07.192 --> 02:51:14.897]  Because, you see, they want America's rivers and farmlands and soils and ports, you know, roadways, bridges, highways.
[02:51:14.937 --> 02:51:16.178]  They want the infrastructure.
[02:51:16.758 --> 02:51:20.681]  If there's any infrastructure left after Biden, you know, ruins everything.
[02:51:21.001 --> 02:51:22.802]  But they want America's infrastructure.
[02:51:22.842 --> 02:51:24.063]  They don't want the American people.
[02:51:24.583 --> 02:51:25.704]  So they've had to accelerate all this.
[02:51:25.724 --> 02:51:33.529]  But I think what has been set into motion now is actually going to end up in the total destruction of the globalists.
[02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:37.172]  Now, America will suffer serious wounds.
[02:51:37.973 --> 02:51:40.555]  And the nation that we once knew will never come back.
[02:51:40.935 --> 02:51:43.817]  We're not going back to 2019 ever again.
[02:51:43.957 --> 02:51:48.140]  But America, it won't be erased from history.
[02:51:48.301 --> 02:51:49.882]  We will surge back.
[02:51:50.002 --> 02:51:50.402]  That's right.
[02:51:50.442 --> 02:51:51.783]  The fun and games are over.
[02:51:51.803 --> 02:51:52.784]  The fun and games are over.
[02:51:53.956 --> 02:51:54.896]  Well, absolutely.
[02:51:54.916 --> 02:52:02.960]  And people now realize, or assume they will, as the people around them keep dying from this vaccine, they will realize this is a life-and-death fight.
[02:52:03.081 --> 02:52:08.763]  This is a fight for survival to the very end, that the globalists want a, quote, final solution against humanity.
[02:52:09.123 --> 02:52:13.986]  And in fact, you know, just going back to what we opened up this hour with, the vaccines that attack pregnant women
[02:52:14.972 --> 02:52:16.353]  That's a vaccine holocaust.
[02:52:16.734 --> 02:52:20.437]  That's a holocaust-scale attack on human babies.
[02:52:20.497 --> 02:52:28.405]  In fact, they're probably going to kill so many babies that Planned Parenthood will complain that they don't have enough babies left to slaughter because they're all killed by the vaccine.
[02:52:28.425 --> 02:52:30.807]  They already admit birth rates are record low in the U.S.
[02:52:30.847 --> 02:52:34.551]  and worldwide just from the lockdown and record-level miscarriages with the injections.
[02:52:34.571 --> 02:52:36.012]  Yeah.
[02:52:36.392 --> 02:52:37.293]  Folks, they've committed.
[02:52:37.333 --> 02:52:37.934]  We're in it now.
[02:52:39.350 --> 02:52:39.830]  Exactly.
[02:52:40.151 --> 02:52:42.592]  And they've already made tactical mistakes.
[02:52:43.032 --> 02:52:47.554]  They have overexposed themselves in ways that are going to come back on them.
[02:52:47.995 --> 02:52:49.315]  But they can't pull it back now.
[02:52:49.415 --> 02:52:50.016]  It's too late.
[02:52:50.036 --> 02:52:50.836]  They acted out of desperation.
[02:52:50.856 --> 02:52:54.518]  Why do you think they pulled Yanks out a month ago and removed him from a command position?
[02:52:56.331 --> 02:52:56.832]  Well, I don't know.
[02:52:56.872 --> 02:52:58.713]  There's a lot of theories about Gates.
[02:52:59.154 --> 02:53:12.067]  I can't speculate right now until more information comes out, but I think he's... Well, okay, my guess is a lot of new information is about to come out about Gates, perhaps related to Maxwell and Corey Case.
[02:53:12.087 --> 02:53:12.427]  That's my guess.
[02:53:13.624 --> 02:53:14.604]  But that's just a guess.
[02:53:14.644 --> 02:53:17.545]  I don't have solid intel on that, so I won't speculate further.
[02:53:18.065 --> 02:53:20.786]  But there are major actions in play here.
[02:53:21.567 --> 02:53:23.507]  It's going to look very bad for some period of time.
[02:53:23.987 --> 02:53:29.229]  But those of us who are dedicated to survival and America and to God, we can make it through.
[02:53:29.409 --> 02:53:31.830]  And that's the most important message I want to share today, Alex.
[02:53:32.430 --> 02:53:35.091]  With your audience in mind is don't give up.
[02:53:35.151 --> 02:53:37.132]  Don't let them win the psychological warfare.
[02:53:37.432 --> 02:53:38.372]  You can make it through.
[02:53:38.772 --> 02:53:39.713]  We can survive.
[02:53:40.073 --> 02:53:43.694]  We come from ancestors who were survivors and pioneers.
[02:53:44.234 --> 02:53:47.555]  They went across America in wagons through harsh winters.
[02:53:47.816 --> 02:53:49.616]  Hey, if they can make it, we can too.
[02:53:49.956 --> 02:53:53.157]  And it's our job not to be victims, but to save people around us.
[02:53:53.478 --> 02:53:54.398]  We're going to be the leaders.
[02:53:55.118 --> 02:54:00.242]  Folks, if you think Mike and I and others are prominent now and people are like, oh my god, Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones now.
[02:54:00.422 --> 02:54:03.244]  Well, everybody's going to be Alex Jones because I just woke up earlier than other people.
[02:54:03.584 --> 02:54:05.225]  And Mike woke up the same time I did.
[02:54:05.605 --> 02:54:08.627]  Now everybody's going to get we were right once this all hits.
[02:54:08.887 --> 02:54:13.130]  And so we're going to have a real leg up on the enemy as long as we survive and persevere.
[02:54:13.650 --> 02:54:15.632]  Most of the left is going to die in their own cities.
[02:54:16.596 --> 02:54:37.414]  Well, exactly right, and even if you and I personally don't survive this, because, you know, they are out to kill some of us, even if we don't survive, the philosophy that we espouse will absolutely survive, and it will live on, and this nation will be great again, and the left will have only achieved the mass extermination of themselves.
[02:54:37.794 --> 02:54:40.697]  96% of Democrats are taking the vaccine, or plan to.
[02:54:40.717 --> 02:54:40.697]  96%.
[02:54:40.737 --> 02:54:44.280]  Have you ever felt the urgency, Mike?
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:45.701]  The urgency we feel now.
[02:54:45.761 --> 02:54:48.542]  I mean, this is like 50 times the urgency I ever felt.
[02:54:48.622 --> 02:54:52.264]  I mean, my whole gut, my intellect knows, man, it's about to get crazy.
[02:54:53.105 --> 02:54:53.305]  Yeah.
[02:54:53.745 --> 02:54:54.365]  No, it is.
[02:54:54.646 --> 02:54:55.586]  You absolutely get it.
[02:54:55.806 --> 02:54:56.286]  And I get it.
[02:54:56.406 --> 02:55:01.729]  And we're very open with our audiences here that we don't know how long we'll be on the air.
[02:55:02.110 --> 02:55:04.611]  We don't know how long the food supply chains will function.
[02:55:05.051 --> 02:55:08.213]  We don't know how long there will be any remaining rule of law in this nation.
[02:55:08.713 --> 02:55:09.515]  We have no idea.
[02:55:09.615 --> 02:55:11.437]  It could be weeks or months away.
[02:55:11.457 --> 02:55:13.981]  We don't know if the power grid is going to function tomorrow.
[02:55:14.021 --> 02:55:15.123]  We absolutely do not know.
[02:55:15.143 --> 02:55:18.267]  It'll start just suddenly with the police walking off, the border collapsing.
[02:55:18.287 --> 02:55:18.948]  It's already happening.
[02:55:19.209 --> 02:55:20.551]  And just suddenly things are burning.
[02:55:20.591 --> 02:55:21.652]  Suddenly the electricity's off.
[02:55:21.893 --> 02:55:23.355]  And then you're just... the rest of your life.
[02:55:24.329 --> 02:55:27.590]  Well, also, just look historically at the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:42.736]  So, one day, they defaulted on, you know, $90 billion, I think, in national debt, you know, the equivalent of Treasury bills, and then three days later, all the regions declared their own independence and sovereignty, and the whole system fell apart.
[02:55:42.916 --> 02:55:43.156]  Boom!
[02:55:43.196 --> 02:55:43.677]  Just like that.
[02:55:44.017 --> 02:55:52.160]  And that's why that metaphor, that collapsing Miami condo, again, God bless those people, I'm not trying to belittle the event, but it's a metaphor.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:58.544]  For what's happening in our society, and once the collapse begins, it accelerates at the speed of gravity.
[02:55:58.824 --> 02:56:00.045]  This can happen overnight.
[02:56:00.465 --> 02:56:01.786]  Overnight, the banks don't function.
[02:56:01.906 --> 02:56:03.046]  Overnight, no ATMs.
[02:56:03.347 --> 02:56:10.271]  Overnight, no more transactional capability in commercial sectors, including transportation, grocery, you know, anything.
[02:56:10.371 --> 02:56:12.312]  Fuel, refineries, everything.
[02:56:12.732 --> 02:56:17.035]  You can wake up next week, and the society you once knew is over.
[02:56:17.515 --> 02:56:23.679]  You've woken up in a futuristic, apocalyptic, post-nuclear, you know, scenario.
[02:56:23.859 --> 02:56:30.063]  Mike, you've got to join me in next week for, and I'm going to see you in over a year, I hope you come to the studio with us, to talk about solutions.
[02:56:30.083 --> 02:56:30.944]  Yeah, I haven't been there in a while.
[02:56:31.224 --> 02:56:32.565]  Yeah, solutions and what we do.
[02:56:32.585 --> 02:56:36.407]  Because you're really, always do a great job, you're really hitting on all cylinders.
[02:56:36.427 --> 02:56:41.290]  Right, and I'm going to talk about, how do we, is there any way to stop this in 60 seconds?
[02:56:41.350 --> 02:56:43.392]  Is there, in your view, any way to stop this?
[02:56:44.773 --> 02:56:45.974]  Well, honestly, no.
[02:56:46.314 --> 02:56:49.656]  Not to stop it, but to recover on the other side and then achieve victory, yes.
[02:56:50.076 --> 02:56:51.917]  But I don't think we can stop what's been said in the military.
[02:56:51.937 --> 02:56:54.379]  So the plane is crashing, but can it be a survivable crash?
[02:56:55.239 --> 02:56:56.720]  Well, absolutely.
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:56.941]  Right.
[02:56:56.981 --> 02:56:57.921]  The plane is crashing.
[02:56:58.021 --> 02:56:59.202]  Some of us have parachutes.
[02:56:59.922 --> 02:57:03.465]  And we can bail out of this plane, and we can then rebuild after the crash.
[02:57:03.525 --> 02:57:04.505]  That's my assessment.
[02:57:06.186 --> 02:57:07.827]  Listen, I see the globalists.
[02:57:08.127 --> 02:57:08.828]  I see their leaders.
[02:57:08.848 --> 02:57:09.969]  They all look scared as hell.
[02:57:10.229 --> 02:57:11.029]  Because they're puppets.
[02:57:11.229 --> 02:57:12.690]  They know what's about to happen.
[02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:13.151]  They're scared.
[02:57:13.191 --> 02:57:13.591]  They should be.
[02:57:14.485 --> 02:57:15.666]  Yeah, they should be.
[02:57:16.547 --> 02:57:17.929]  Because they're going to be impacted by it, too.
[02:57:17.949 --> 02:57:20.111]  And they're also destroying their own voter base, by the way.
[02:57:20.792 --> 02:57:24.156]  There would be mass murder across Democrats because of the spike protein.
[02:57:25.097 --> 02:57:28.540]  So, you know, the whole landscape is going to be changed from here forward.
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:30.503]  These are the last days of anything we recognize.
[02:57:32.345 --> 02:57:33.406]  The history once knew is over.
[02:57:34.793 --> 02:57:36.433]  We live to see the new world order, Mike.
[02:57:36.513 --> 02:57:37.654]  We live to be in it, man.
[02:57:38.194 --> 02:57:39.294]  Wow, thank you so much.
[02:57:39.834 --> 02:57:40.254]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:57:40.274 --> 02:57:40.574]  Thank you.
[02:57:40.594 --> 02:57:42.834]  Nationalnews.com, alltheinfowars.com.
[02:57:42.854 --> 02:57:46.515]  We'll do five more minutes and hand the baton to the guest hosts that's coming up.
[02:57:47.295 --> 02:57:48.055]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:57:48.175 --> 02:57:49.616]  You just heard the truth, okay?
[02:57:49.996 --> 02:57:52.136]  Get right with Jesus right now.
[02:57:52.836 --> 02:57:56.617]  It's hard to believe that July 4th, 2021 is almost here.
[02:57:58.597 --> 02:58:01.918]  It's hard to believe that our country is literally fighting for its life.
[02:58:03.049 --> 02:58:07.712]  But for all the negative things that are happening, a lot of really positive things are happening as well.
[02:58:08.332 --> 02:58:13.396]  It's been said by many historians that things have to get really, really bad before they get better.
[02:58:13.856 --> 02:58:16.858]  And we're now reaching that point of no return, that tipping point.
[02:58:17.018 --> 02:58:17.859]  Global government.
[02:58:18.567 --> 02:58:22.009]  And its planetary depopulation plan is now out in the open.
[02:58:22.470 --> 02:58:25.211]  And people realize the time for fun and games is over.
[02:58:25.231 --> 02:58:31.556]  That's why I wanted to report to you, the listeners and viewers of this transmission, the good news today, as well as the bad news.
[02:58:32.216 --> 02:58:43.784]  I've been contacted in the last two weeks by some of the top people in international media and national news as well, as well as some of the folks at the highest levels of government, corporations, the private sector, you name it.
[02:58:44.184 --> 02:58:45.645]  And they've all told me the same thing.
[02:58:46.185 --> 02:58:46.946]  Alex, keep it up.
[02:58:47.950 --> 02:58:52.755]  You've been vindicated and we're having a major breakthrough thanks to your work.
[02:58:53.496 --> 02:58:57.621]  Well I wanted the listeners to know that it's you that have allowed this to happen.
[02:58:58.141 --> 02:59:00.945]  You have been just as important as I've been and so at least now
[02:59:02.657 --> 02:59:10.559]  World government is attacking, but we have a chance to defeat it because we've worked together for decades to warn people about what was coming.
[02:59:10.919 --> 02:59:11.799]  It sounded insane.
[02:59:11.859 --> 02:59:12.600]  It sounded crazy.
[02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:13.400]  It sounded dangerous.
[02:59:13.680 --> 02:59:14.440]  It sounded made up.
[02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:18.661]  It sounded like a horror movie, a science fiction dystopia, but it was real.
[02:59:19.381 --> 02:59:21.342]  And so we knew it was real and we knew they were going to pull this.
[02:59:22.170 --> 02:59:27.653]  And so now that they've actually launched their operation, people aren't being completely caught flat-footed.
[02:59:28.053 --> 02:59:29.794]  So that's the real power of InfoWars.
[02:59:30.335 --> 02:59:32.716]  That's why it's more important than ever to help keep it on air.
[02:59:33.156 --> 02:59:41.241]  We have a July 4th special running right now with storewide free shipping, double Patriot points is back as well, and up to 60% off best-selling items like X3.
[02:59:41.741 --> 02:59:51.487]  So please, take action today and help keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever, because our mission is proving that it's incredibly accurate and has been part of the human destiny for liberty and freedom.
[03:00:04.599 --> 03:00:09.761]  We are investigating the center of the web, and we're going wherever the truth takes us.
[03:00:10.642 --> 03:00:12.823]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[03:00:17.426 --> 03:00:21.448]  This hour, officials say multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein has taken his own life.
[03:00:21.488 --> 03:00:26.049]  Jeffrey Epstein is dead after being found unresponsive at a New York City jail Saturday morning.
[03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:28.150]  After apparently taking his own life.
[03:00:28.270 --> 03:00:30.691]  Officials say that his death was an apparent suicide.
[03:00:30.891 --> 03:00:35.273]  Surveillance video recorded inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center is missing.
[03:00:35.413 --> 03:00:39.635]  A camera situated just outside of Epstein's jail cell is unusable.
[03:00:39.755 --> 03:00:45.598]  Footage from at least one camera in the hallway may be too damaged or unusable for investigators.
[03:00:45.678 --> 03:00:49.639]  An FBI crime lab is examining two prison cameras that malfunctioned.
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:51.680]  Surveillance video from outside his jail cell?
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:52.901]  It's gone missing!
[03:00:52.941 --> 03:01:04.126]  Now this will of course raise even more questions about whether the surveillance cameras were purposely tampered with and if Epstein's death was more than just suicide by hanging as it was ruled in an autopsy.
[03:01:05.305 --> 03:01:14.807]  The Bureau of Prison Guards assigned to monitor Jeffrey Epstein the night he killed himself, they've admitted they falsified records and they've now made a deal with federal prosecutors.
[03:01:14.867 --> 03:01:15.587]  Their sentence?
[03:01:15.607 --> 03:01:18.028]  100 hours of community service.
[03:01:18.048 --> 03:01:26.830]  9 East 71st Street is an extremely historic address right in the middle of New York City.
[03:01:27.650 --> 03:01:28.750]  It's the center of a web.
[03:01:30.074 --> 03:01:33.257]  Of a international operation to blackmail not just U.S.
[03:01:33.277 --> 03:01:36.399]  government officials, but also top scientists.
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:43.806]  It's the home address of Jeffrey Epstein and his seven-story sex dungeon palace.
[03:01:45.672 --> 03:01:56.458]  InfoWars has been on Epstein's trail for more than 15 years, and the web that emanates out from this address doesn't just control the United States, but many nations across the world.
[03:01:57.219 --> 03:02:06.384]  In this investigation, we're going to be bringing you some of the latest information on what the death of Jeffrey Epstein really signifies, and the fact that the networks he controlled are still operating today.
[03:02:06.604 --> 03:02:09.025]  Jeffrey Epstein may be dead, but this story isn't.
[03:02:09.125 --> 03:02:16.608]  A shocking new report from the New York Times sheds light on the connection between Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the late Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:02:16.788 --> 03:02:21.310]  Tonight, there is a real possibility other Epstein associates could face criminal charges.
[03:02:21.490 --> 03:02:22.130]  That's right, Tom.
[03:02:22.150 --> 03:02:29.934]  There's an ongoing investigation into possible accomplices to Epstein's crimes, and there are still thousands of documents in the civil suit that remain under seal.
[03:02:29.954 --> 03:02:32.915]  There is an active effort to make those documents public.
[03:02:33.035 --> 03:02:36.316]  Epstein has had several high-profile friendships in the past.
[03:02:36.696 --> 03:02:41.898]  President Bill Clinton reportedly rode on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times in the early 2000s.
[03:02:41.918 --> 03:02:47.239]  It's no secret that former President Bill Clinton had a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:02:47.259 --> 03:02:53.141]  Wall Street tycoon Jeffrey Epstein used the Lolita Express to ferry a bevy of beautiful young women.
[03:02:53.501 --> 03:02:57.462]  Among the passengers, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew.
[03:02:57.722 --> 03:03:00.183]  FAA records show that Bill Clinton
[03:03:00.843 --> 03:03:04.385]  is on the airplane of Jeffrey Epstein 26 times.
[03:03:04.405 --> 03:03:07.346]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, mainstream corporate media
[03:03:20.049 --> 03:03:24.852]  Wikipedia are all covering up what's really happening.
[03:03:25.092 --> 03:03:31.716]  Every day I get more and more pissed because I'm just like, oh my god, what we had was unreal.
[03:03:32.096 --> 03:03:34.758]  Other women backing it up, hey, yep.
[03:03:36.178 --> 03:03:45.204]  Brad Edwards, the attorney, three years ago saying, there will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known.
[03:03:45.224 --> 03:03:47.305]  I had it all three years ago.
[03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:57.599]  How many men transporting underage girls came to this keypad and entered the code so that this dungeon door would open?
[03:03:57.879 --> 03:04:04.606]  Queen Elizabeth II's son, the Duke of York, or Prince Andrew, was famously caught repeatedly
[03:04:05.811 --> 03:04:08.732]  I'm creeping in and out of those doors with young women going in and out.
[03:04:09.733 --> 03:04:12.554]  That's how powerful this web of control is.
[03:04:13.155 --> 03:04:29.683]  An investigation by this program into the notorious sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged partner Ghislaine Maxwell has found multiple claims that the pair targeted, groomed, trafficked and sexually abused at least half a dozen young women in the UK over a 10-year period.
[03:04:30.683 --> 03:04:38.427]  For years, the daughter of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell lived a rarefied life in the highest echelons of British society.
[03:04:39.768 --> 03:04:46.432]  A regular fixture at the most glamorous parties in Mayfair and Knightsbridge, and close to royalty itself.
[03:04:48.703 --> 03:04:55.912]  We've pored over thousands of court documents, accounts, books, photographs and videos and spoken with multiple sources.
[03:04:56.433 --> 03:05:02.660]  They reveal that both Maxwell and Epstein regularly visited the UK where alleged abuse took place.
[03:05:03.882 --> 03:05:04.402]  Would you get it?
[03:05:05.248 --> 03:05:08.250]  Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us.
[03:05:08.650 --> 03:05:14.454]  If and when the vaccine comes, it's not likely to go through all the tests and the trials that are needed to be done.
[03:05:14.834 --> 03:05:19.397]  When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who's going to take the shot?
[03:05:20.237 --> 03:05:21.358]  Who's going to take the shot?
[03:05:21.878 --> 03:05:24.160]  You're going to be the first one to say, put me, sign me up.
[03:05:24.940 --> 03:05:26.181]  They now say it's OK.
[03:05:26.541 --> 03:05:30.904]  And the question of whether it's real when it's there, that requires enormous transparency.
[03:05:31.738 --> 03:05:36.644]  You got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation so they can look and see.
[03:05:37.384 --> 03:05:38.345]  So there's consensus.
[03:05:38.385 --> 03:05:39.947]  This is a safe vaccine.
[03:05:40.488 --> 03:05:43.051]  If the president announced tomorrow we have a vaccine, would you take it?
[03:05:43.992 --> 03:05:48.877]  Only if it was completely transparent that other experts in the country could look at it.
[03:05:49.498 --> 03:05:52.041]  Only if we knew all of what went into it.
[03:05:52.401 --> 03:05:59.264]  If Donald Trump can't give answers and the administration can't give answers to these three questions, the American people should not have confidence.
[03:05:59.344 --> 03:06:02.265]  But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.
[03:06:05.026 --> 03:06:10.989]  Despite the high-profile scandal, all of this seemingly escaped the attention of the police here at Scotland Yard.
[03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:21.556]  Until 2015, when a British child abuse campaigner filed a formal complaint claiming that Epstein and Maxwell had trafficked a woman to the UK for sex.
[03:06:22.276 --> 03:06:32.242]  The complaint was based on the court testimony of Virginia Roberts, who was just 17 when she said she was pressured by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew in London.
[03:06:33.522 --> 03:06:44.225]  In a statement, the Met told us they were not the appropriate authority to investigate and that any investigation would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK.
[03:06:45.425 --> 03:06:51.427]  In November 2016, they said, a decision was made not to proceed to a full criminal investigation.
[03:06:51.447 --> 03:06:54.368]  And that was the end of it.
[03:06:54.568 --> 03:07:03.110]  The Met have explicitly denied that Prince Andrew's involvement with Maxwell and Epstein had any bearing on their decision not to investigate fully.
[03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:10.061]  The problem was the fact that once he had been convicted... You stayed with him?
[03:07:10.181 --> 03:07:11.721]  I stayed with him.
[03:07:11.741 --> 03:07:22.425]  And that's the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis, because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family.
[03:07:22.605 --> 03:07:29.327]  And we try and uphold the highest standards and practices, and I let the side down.
[03:07:29.727 --> 03:07:30.127]  Simple as that.
[03:07:30.865 --> 03:07:35.811]  One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, has made allegations against you.
[03:07:36.631 --> 03:07:38.193]  She says she met you in 2001.
[03:07:39.434 --> 03:07:43.679]  She says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London.
[03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:50.386]  She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia, belonging to Gerlaine Maxwell, your friend.
[03:07:51.167 --> 03:07:51.788]  Your response?
[03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:56.506]  I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady.
[03:07:57.708 --> 03:07:58.429]  None whatsoever.
[03:07:58.630 --> 03:08:00.714]  You don't remember meeting her?
[03:08:00.734 --> 03:08:00.814]  No.
[03:08:01.613 --> 03:08:18.886]  And then when you research Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend and the fact that her father worked for British intelligence and the Mossad, and the fact that he was involved compromising members of the British aristocracy, you understand this was a family business the entire time.
[03:08:19.226 --> 03:08:24.430]  In July 2019, Jeffrey Epstein took his own life in a prison in New York.
[03:08:26.463 --> 03:08:32.384]  Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared but was tracked down and arrested in New Hampshire in July last year.
[03:08:33.652 --> 03:08:46.942]  We allege that from at least 1994 through at least 1997, Ms Maxwell assisted Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by helping to recruit, entice, groom and abuse children under the age of 18.
[03:08:47.122 --> 03:08:58.270]  The 59-year-old is facing up to 80 years imprisonment for her alleged role in procuring four underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse between 1994 and 2004.
[03:09:01.292 --> 03:09:04.274]  Ghislaine Maxwell has been denied bail three times now.
[03:09:04.974 --> 03:09:06.395]  Dubbed a flight risk, she is.
[03:09:07.215 --> 03:09:16.941]  Her lawyers have called her confinement conditions horrific due to a lack of drinking water, sewage stench and an inability to meet privately with lawyers.
[03:09:17.489 --> 03:09:24.214]  Jeffrey Epstein's longtime confidant, Jelaine Maxwell, facing two new charges, including, for the first time, sex trafficking.
[03:09:24.574 --> 03:09:32.160]  The new indictment also adds a fourth alleged victim, saying Maxwell groomed and paid a 14-year-old girl to engage in sex acts with Epstein from 2001 to 2004.
[03:09:34.181 --> 03:09:42.348]  I think when you look at the charges that have been added here, those sex trafficking charges as you mentioned, you think about those and you think about the potential penalties if she's convicted.
[03:09:42.388 --> 03:09:55.479]  Now she's pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the past, some of them are on screen right now, but when you look at the sex trafficking charge in particular, in the conspiracy sex traffic, you look at those charges and you look at the maximum penalties
[03:09:55.939 --> 03:10:00.383]  It could be effectively a life sentence for her if she's convicted and given the maximum here.
[03:10:00.443 --> 03:10:03.125]  So the allegations are very disturbing.
[03:10:03.225 --> 03:10:22.821]  This involved allegedly a 14-year-old girl that apparently on numerous occasions she was paid quote hundreds of dollars according to the superseding indictment to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein that originally was supposed to be massages for him and then it turned into to sex acts and sex abuse on behalf of
[03:10:23.121 --> 03:10:37.615]  Jeffrey Epstein, of course we've seen that in nearly every other victim before, that she was involved allegedly in grooming this young person, that she appeared nude several times in front of this person, made inappropriate comments.
[03:10:38.215 --> 03:10:38.915]  I don't know.
[03:10:59.224 --> 03:11:11.870]  An affidavit filed in April alleges Epstein and his supposed ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, told a 15-year-old girl to take off all of her clothes and then touched her inappropriately on a massage table at the ranch in 1996.
[03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:21.654]  And in a lawsuit filed Tuesday morning, an accuser claims Epstein coerced her to engage in sex acts there between 2007 and 2010.
[03:11:22.214 --> 03:11:26.276]  Soon after the well-connected Epstein registered as a sex offender here in New Mexico,
[03:11:26.476 --> 03:11:29.157]  State officials informed him that he wasn't required to do so.
[03:11:29.497 --> 03:11:32.378]  That's despite having to register in Florida and New York.
[03:11:33.098 --> 03:11:41.681]  Official documents from 2010 show that just two days after Epstein registered in New Mexico, a legal loophole allowed him to be taken off the list.
[03:11:41.961 --> 03:11:42.401]  The reason?
[03:11:42.861 --> 03:11:48.603]  The victim in his Florida case was not younger than 16, a condition for registry in New Mexico.
[03:11:48.823 --> 03:11:51.929]  The corrupt system has tried to hide the horrors that have gone on in here.
[03:11:52.390 --> 03:11:55.236]  They've tried to block it behind these codes and these big doors.
[03:11:55.997 --> 03:11:58.001]  But you and I have blown this thing wide open.
[03:11:58.601 --> 03:12:04.606]  Law enforcement sources say several accusers have come forward in New Mexico, where Epstein owns a sprawling ranch.
[03:12:05.066 --> 03:12:13.793]  According to a new report published in the New York Times, Epstein wanted to use the ranch for controlled breeding, using his DNA to improve humanity.
[03:12:14.113 --> 03:12:28.064]  Citing two award-winning scientists and an advisor to large companies and wealthy individuals, the article reports Epstein surrounded himself with leading scientists and would tell them he wanted to have 20 women impregnated at a time on the ranch.
[03:12:28.524 --> 03:12:32.569]  Well, tonight we're learning much more about the people Jeffrey Epstein targeted.
[03:12:32.889 --> 03:12:37.995]  The director of MIT's Media Lab, Joichi Ito, announced Saturday that he is stepping down.
[03:12:38.536 --> 03:12:42.961]  He's been facing criticism for his financial ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:12:43.422 --> 03:12:49.065]  Three top MIT administrators signed off on donations from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:12:49.485 --> 03:13:02.511]  Investigators faulting head lawyer R. Gregory Morgan, fundraising chief Jeffrey Newton, and VP Treasurer Israel Ruiz, saying there were, quote, significant errors in judgment that resulted in serious damage to the MIT community.
[03:13:03.792 --> 03:13:08.218]  I started conversations with the MIT Media Lab about the position that I was applying for.
[03:13:08.798 --> 03:13:18.631]  It was explained to me that Joey Ito and Jeffrey Epstein had an existing relationship and that part of my job would be to help aid that relationship along.
[03:13:18.871 --> 03:13:21.392]  And Epstein's money was purposely marked anonymous.
[03:13:21.732 --> 03:13:28.995]  The donation's driven by former Media Lab Director Joy Ito and Mechanical Engineering Professor Seth Lloyd, who's been placed on leave.
[03:13:29.355 --> 03:13:35.818]  We were expected to keep this quiet at every turn, involving as few people as possible.
[03:13:36.378 --> 03:13:43.781]  He was referred to by just his initials, sometimes a pseudonym, but in general we were just supposed to avoid
[03:13:45.106 --> 03:13:52.751]  Other people learning about this, uh, the visit, where he came to the lab, we were expected to keep off books as much as possible.
[03:13:53.292 --> 03:13:58.175]  And according to this report, Epstein visited this campus nine times since 2013.
[03:13:58.715 --> 03:14:00.716]  He was here for nine times.
[03:14:00.736 --> 03:14:10.303]  I mean, there are apparently hundreds, maybe thousands of hours of closed circuit TV footage from Epstein's various properties that are still under seal for some reason.
[03:14:10.323 --> 03:14:14.846]  Will we ever find out who exactly was involved in whatever scam he was running?
[03:14:15.526 --> 03:14:18.668]  So the big question is, what's more evil?
[03:14:19.388 --> 03:14:20.169]  Skull and Bones?
[03:14:21.089 --> 03:14:21.990]  Bohemian Grove?
[03:14:22.930 --> 03:14:26.452]  Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile sex dungeon?
[03:14:27.613 --> 03:14:31.355]  Or the larger system that controls it?
[03:14:31.975 --> 03:14:33.036]  That's where we're going next.
[03:14:34.337 --> 03:14:37.338]  There are a lot of historic locations in New York City.
[03:14:37.358 --> 03:14:38.879]  A lot of historic buildings.
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:43.662]  But this building right here doesn't have any names on it.
[03:14:44.841 --> 03:14:47.202]  Does it tell you who's based here?
[03:14:48.042 --> 03:14:51.223]  Does it tell you what business they're engaged in?
[03:14:52.603 --> 03:14:58.465]  There's a name on the building for who it was named after over a hundred years ago, but that's it.
[03:14:59.445 --> 03:15:11.829]  But the decisions that have been made in this building created the modern United Nations we know of today, the Bretton Woods Agreement for world currency, and basically every other
[03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:17.503]  Major governmental system we've seen in the 20th century and now the 21st century.
[03:15:24.102 --> 03:15:31.650]  For 100 years, the Council on Foreign Relations has been helping America play a vital part on the world stage.
[03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:45.163]  The Council has served as an invaluable resource for its members, policymakers, and the public by publishing bold new ideas, providing research and a forum for debate, and proposing policies.
[03:15:46.588 --> 03:15:54.894]  CFR has helped navigate the challenges of a changing world ever since it was born out of the ashes of a global conflict.
[03:15:59.218 --> 03:16:08.345]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:16:20.302 --> 03:16:25.043]  We're pulling up on a relic of when we still had a border, an internal checkpoint.
[03:16:25.363 --> 03:16:26.623]  What is this, 30 miles off the border?
[03:16:26.863 --> 03:16:27.023]  Right.
[03:16:28.483 --> 03:16:30.064]  So a relic where they ask your U.S.
[03:16:30.104 --> 03:16:31.524]  citizen, are you any kind of man?
[03:16:32.044 --> 03:16:33.364]  I'm like, no, I'm not the Border Patrol.
[03:16:33.384 --> 03:16:35.645]  I don't complete the smuggling process.
[03:16:36.165 --> 03:16:40.705]  What the Biden administration is doing is they are actually completing the smuggling cycle.
[03:16:41.006 --> 03:16:44.786]  They're helping cartels make money hand over foot.
[03:16:45.086 --> 03:16:49.287]  I don't dislike the average Border Patrol agent, but now it's all vestigial.
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:51.542]  Like tits on a boar.
[03:16:52.804 --> 03:16:53.845]  And there is no border.
[03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:57.110]  Well, here we go.
[03:16:59.013 --> 03:17:00.376]  They got the dogs and everything.
[03:17:00.396 --> 03:17:02.859]  Little doggies.
[03:17:06.778 --> 03:17:07.078]  Ask us.
[03:17:08.218 --> 03:17:08.978]  How you doing?
[03:17:08.999 --> 03:17:09.379]  Good.
[03:17:09.699 --> 03:17:10.679]  Anybody else back here?
[03:17:10.759 --> 03:17:11.359]  Uh, one person.
[03:17:11.379 --> 03:17:12.119]  One person back here.
[03:17:12.139 --> 03:17:13.019]  Nobody behind you, sir?
[03:17:13.079 --> 03:17:13.259]  No.
[03:17:13.479 --> 03:17:14.040]  Okay, alright.
[03:17:14.060 --> 03:17:14.640]  You guys U.S.
[03:17:14.660 --> 03:17:15.060]  citizens?
[03:17:15.180 --> 03:17:15.400]  Yes.
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:16.720]  We are not the Border Patrol.
[03:17:16.740 --> 03:17:17.980]  We are not smuggling any people.
[03:17:18.520 --> 03:17:19.721]  Hope not.
[03:17:19.741 --> 03:17:20.641]  We're not the Border Patrol.
[03:17:20.861 --> 03:17:23.582]  The Border Patrol smuggles them across and gives them to Catholic Charities.
[03:17:24.062 --> 03:17:25.302]  The Border Patrol smuggles them across?
[03:17:25.322 --> 03:17:25.722]  Damn right.
[03:17:25.742 --> 03:17:26.642]  We got all the video, man.
[03:17:26.662 --> 03:17:28.042]  No, we don't smuggle them across.
[03:17:28.082 --> 03:17:28.583]  Yep, you do.
[03:17:28.623 --> 03:17:29.423]  This is the stigil.
[03:17:29.723 --> 03:17:30.143]  It's for who?
[03:17:30.443 --> 03:17:31.183]  The stigil.
[03:17:31.223 --> 03:17:31.843]  What's the stigil?
[03:17:32.163 --> 03:17:34.824]  The stigil means like, uh, tits on a boar.
[03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:36.000]  Okay.
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:38.601]  Means the border's been gotten rid of, the whole U.N.
[03:17:38.621 --> 03:17:39.061]  program.
[03:17:39.521 --> 03:17:39.801]  Okay.
[03:17:39.821 --> 03:17:40.601]  You guys know about it?
[03:17:41.162 --> 03:17:41.682]  Yeah.
[03:17:41.702 --> 03:17:49.404]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:17:49.424 --> 03:17:50.304]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:17:51.765 --> 03:17:56.406]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[03:17:56.786 --> 03:17:58.407]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[03:17:58.707 --> 03:17:59.647]  They deserve to be heard.
[03:17:59.667 --> 03:18:00.527]  That's who we are.
[03:18:01.988 --> 03:18:02.848]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:18:03.891 --> 03:18:06.013]  I mean, this is like every 10 minutes now.
[03:18:07.373 --> 03:18:11.757]  So I'm wondering if they're picking them up at Donna and only picking up women and children.
[03:18:12.417 --> 03:18:13.298]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:18:13.538 --> 03:18:17.561]  So once they get to the destination city of their choice, they're free to go.
[03:18:17.841 --> 03:18:21.744]  They're free to go and the government will never find them again unless they want to be found.
[03:18:21.764 --> 03:18:22.624]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:18:24.345 --> 03:18:30.270]  The root cause are the messages coming from the Biden White House encouraging people to come, encouraging children.
[03:18:32.611 --> 03:18:33.552]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:18:43.254 --> 03:18:52.318]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:59.742]  What the Biden administration is doing is they are actually completing the smuggling cycle.
[03:19:00.042 --> 03:19:03.824]  They're helping cartels make money hand over foot.
[03:19:04.404 --> 03:19:05.925]  We don't smuggle people, though.
[03:19:05.945 --> 03:19:08.046]  You may not, but your comrades do.
[03:19:08.086 --> 03:19:08.386]  Take care.
[03:19:12.824 --> 03:19:13.884]  Do they smuggle people, Tim?
[03:19:15.045 --> 03:19:16.485]  Well, they definitely help with it.
[03:19:16.826 --> 03:19:18.246]  That's for sure, from what we've seen.
[03:19:21.027 --> 03:19:22.048]  And he seemed like a nice guy.
[03:19:22.068 --> 03:19:22.668]  Wasn't trying to be a d***.
[03:19:24.929 --> 03:19:26.809]  But I did teach him about today's word for schedule.
[03:19:30.791 --> 03:19:34.492]  Oh, no, no.
[03:19:34.572 --> 03:19:36.093]  I don't even know what this is.
[03:19:36.473 --> 03:19:38.314]  How did you get here?
[03:19:39.798 --> 03:19:41.860]  I just caught you, American!
[03:19:42.180 --> 03:19:44.222]  You visited Bandar Video!
[03:19:44.242 --> 03:19:48.405]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[03:19:48.965 --> 03:19:55.851]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt your eyes!
[03:19:57.152 --> 03:19:57.592]  Kung-Fu!
[03:19:57.612 --> 03:20:01.275]  It comes from China.
[03:20:05.464 --> 03:20:11.389]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.712 --> 03:20:23.921]  With crafting a path to lasting peace, known as the Inquiry, this project helps guide his vision for the post-war order.
[03:20:24.841 --> 03:20:29.526]  That all people are wedded and devoted to the idea of international justice.
[03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:37.333]  Members of the Inquiry set sail with President Wilson to work the sidelines of the Versailles Peace Conference.
[03:20:41.095 --> 03:20:47.178]  The treaty sign, European powers agree to Wilson's idea of a League of Nations.
[03:20:48.758 --> 03:20:50.999]  But in the end, the Senate rejects it.
[03:20:52.260 --> 03:20:58.943]  Undeterred, members of the Inquiry vowed to continue encouraging American participation in world affairs.
[03:21:03.826 --> 03:21:07.905]  Back in New York, they formed the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:21:09.161 --> 03:21:20.830]  While comprised at the time mostly of white Northeastern men, the Council's mission has endured through a century, even as the organization, the country, and the world all changed.
[03:21:21.691 --> 03:21:35.061]  It aspires to be a continuous conference on international questions affecting the United States by bringing together experts on statecraft, finance, industry, education, and science.
[03:21:35.661 --> 03:21:40.465]  It lies at the corner of Park Avenue and East 68th Street in New York City.
[03:21:41.005 --> 03:21:48.852]  An organization publicly created by British intelligence with the express goal of merging the British Empire with the United States.
[03:21:49.832 --> 03:21:51.033]  And it's right here in New York City.
[03:21:51.073 --> 03:21:55.297]  It's got an American flag flying right there above it.
[03:21:56.037 --> 03:22:03.623]  But this building was established working with a foreign intelligence agency in 1922.
[03:22:05.623 --> 03:22:07.845]  This building is the Pratt House.
[03:22:08.826 --> 03:22:14.070]  This building is the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:22:14.491 --> 03:22:22.257]  And so this is the important thing to, I think, understand, that this left-right paradigm is a political ploy.
[03:22:22.878 --> 03:22:25.080]  It works very well for those who know what they're doing.
[03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:32.827]  We find that the Republican Party and the Democrat Party both are pretty much in the hands of a relatively small group of people.
[03:22:33.669 --> 03:22:37.932]  With a membership of about 4,000, it's called the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:22:38.353 --> 03:22:43.316]  These are the people that are really pulling the strings in both the Republican and the Democrat Party.
[03:22:43.857 --> 03:22:45.118]  And they've even written about it.
[03:22:45.658 --> 03:22:51.743]  There's a fellow by the name of Carol Quigley, who's a former history professor at Georgetown University.
[03:22:52.103 --> 03:22:58.666]  And he comes to a very interesting point in one of his books where he says, okay, this is the way the real world is.
[03:22:58.686 --> 03:23:10.770]  He said, how is it that we, collectivists, we elitists, how can we rule the world when at the same time we want to let the average person think that they're living in a, quote, democracy?
[03:23:11.171 --> 03:23:13.592]  They're living in a system where their vote counts.
[03:23:14.092 --> 03:23:15.772]  And he answers the question brilliantly.
[03:23:15.812 --> 03:23:16.813]  He said, it's very simple.
[03:23:17.353 --> 03:23:32.439]  You've got to have two major political parties, and they'll both have the same major goals, the same basic fundamental principles, and they'll argue with each other on the surface with slogans and leadership and style and all of that sort of thing.
[03:23:32.459 --> 03:23:35.701]  He said, but we will control them both.
[03:23:36.501 --> 03:23:42.804]  A special televised meeting of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations provides a window to the real story.
[03:23:43.484 --> 03:23:45.705]  The speaker, Vice President Dick Cheney,
[03:23:46.403 --> 03:24:10.434]  Mr. Vice President, I just enjoyed so much your whole speech, but I was particularly pleased that you gave such a strong endorsement for the Free Trade Agreement for all the Americans, a subject that has been of great concern to me for many years, and particularly recently, and I think it's absolutely essential for the strength of our economy.
[03:24:11.818 --> 03:24:17.323]  Rockefeller's role in the drive for an FTAA was a lot more central than he portrays.
[03:24:18.064 --> 03:24:22.968]  Rockefeller cultivated Latin American leaders who could be counted on to support such a proposal.
[03:24:23.549 --> 03:24:31.736]  Both the 1994 Miami Summit and the FTAA proposal were conceived and nurtured by a Rockefeller-created network.
[03:24:32.457 --> 03:24:35.500]  Prominent among the organization sponsoring the Miami event
[03:24:36.184 --> 03:24:37.646]  We're the Council of the Americas.
[03:24:38.066 --> 03:24:40.469]  Founder and Honorary Chairman, David Rockefeller.
[03:24:40.929 --> 03:24:42.311]  The Americas Society.
[03:24:42.651 --> 03:24:44.193]  Chairman, David Rockefeller.
[03:24:44.653 --> 03:24:45.954]  The Forum of the Americas.
[03:24:46.075 --> 03:24:47.796]  Founder, David Rockefeller.
[03:24:48.097 --> 03:24:53.142]  The Institute for International Economics, Financial Backer and Board Member, David Rockefeller.
[03:24:53.482 --> 03:24:54.664]  The Trilateral Commission.
[03:24:54.924 --> 03:24:57.667]  Founder and Honorary Chairman, David Rockefeller.
[03:24:58.937 --> 03:25:02.178]  Rockefeller's influence also extends to the current administration.
[03:25:02.679 --> 03:25:12.302]  He was chairman emeritus of the CFR when Vice President Dick Cheney once served as a director, a relationship that Cheney concealed during his congressional career.
[03:25:13.063 --> 03:25:15.664]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:25:15.784 --> 03:25:21.706]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[03:25:22.463 --> 03:25:26.007]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[03:25:26.568 --> 03:25:31.434]  Thank you very much, Richard, and I am delighted to be here in these new headquarters.
[03:25:32.555 --> 03:25:42.486]  I have been often to, I guess, the mothership in New York City, but it's good to have an outpost of the council right here down the street from the State Department.
[03:25:43.187 --> 03:25:53.550]  We get a lot of advice from the Council, so this will mean I won't have this far to go to be told what we should be doing and how we should think about the future.
[03:25:53.570 --> 03:26:00.552]  The CFR exists, the Trilateral Commission exists, and it's a, quote, conspiracy of ideas.
[03:26:00.612 --> 03:26:02.253]  This is an ideological battle.
[03:26:02.313 --> 03:26:06.394]  Some people believe in globalism, others of us believe in national sovereignty.
[03:26:07.054 --> 03:26:16.798]  And there is a move on toward a North American Union, just like early on there was a move on for a European Union and it eventually ended up.
[03:26:16.878 --> 03:26:20.180]  So we had NAFTA and moving toward a NAFTA highway.
[03:26:20.240 --> 03:26:21.140]  These are real things.
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:23.161]  It's not somebody made these up.
[03:26:23.241 --> 03:26:24.342]  It's not a conspiracy.
[03:26:24.682 --> 03:26:28.343]  They don't talk about it and they might not admit about it, but there's been money spent on it.
[03:26:28.884 --> 03:26:34.146]  There was legislation passed in the Texas legislature unanimously to put a halt on it.
[03:26:34.526 --> 03:26:45.558]  They're planning on millions of acres taken by eminent domain for an international highway from Mexico to Canada, which is going to make the immigration problem that much worse.
[03:26:45.918 --> 03:26:50.383]  So it's not so much a secretive conspiracy.
[03:26:50.863 --> 03:27:03.498]  It's a contest between ideologies, whether we believe in our institutions here, our national sovereignty, our constitution, or are we going to further move in the direction of international government, more UN.
[03:27:03.538 --> 03:27:06.242]  You know, this country goes to war under UN resolutions.
[03:27:06.602 --> 03:27:07.183]  I don't like that.
[03:27:07.503 --> 03:27:08.724]  Big government in Washington.
[03:27:09.085 --> 03:27:12.228]  So I don't like this trend toward international government.
[03:27:12.428 --> 03:27:17.574]  We have a WTO that wants to control our drug industry, our nutritional products.
[03:27:17.934 --> 03:27:22.199]  So I'm against all that, but it's not so much as a sinister conspiracy.
[03:27:22.539 --> 03:27:24.161]  It's just knowledge is out there.
[03:27:24.421 --> 03:27:29.186]  If we look for it, you'll realize that our national sovereignty is under threat.
[03:27:30.063 --> 03:27:38.645]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn't.
[03:27:39.365 --> 03:27:45.146]  So they said they were walking out to the press conference, and I said, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[03:27:46.046 --> 03:27:48.287]  They said, you have no authority, you're not the president.
[03:27:48.307 --> 03:27:49.747]  The president said, I said, call him.
[03:27:51.447 --> 03:27:53.348]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.
[03:27:54.045 --> 03:27:55.307]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[03:27:55.347 --> 03:27:57.611]  I'm going to be leaving here, and I think it was what, six hours?
[03:27:57.691 --> 03:27:59.213]  I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[03:27:59.734 --> 03:28:02.098]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[03:28:02.819 --> 03:28:03.660]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[03:28:05.191 --> 03:28:05.792]  Got fired.
[03:28:06.392 --> 03:28:19.064]  The Royal Institute of International Affairs is the main roundtable group that in the early 1920s created its first major offshoot, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:28:20.005 --> 03:28:27.792]  And it also set up similar chapters in India, in different nations in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, all across Europe.
[03:28:28.493 --> 03:28:38.203]  This is the predecessor of the Bilderberg Group, of the Davos Group, and all of these other major global organizations that are pushing the Great Reset.
[03:28:38.684 --> 03:28:49.695]  And they go in, per country, and recruit thousands of the best and brightest in academia, banking, science, the military, and get them on board with their global operation.
[03:28:49.915 --> 03:28:51.156]  And as long as you agree with them,
[03:28:51.957 --> 03:29:01.257]  As long as you go along with their plan to transfer national power to unelected multinational corporations and governments, you will be pushed upwards through the ranks.
[03:29:17.282 --> 03:29:18.803]  Smithing and do all kinds of things, you know?
[03:29:18.823 --> 03:29:19.863]  Do you even sell guns?
[03:29:19.983 --> 03:29:23.965]  We even, we, well... Oh, God, a rabble slave with a weapon!
[03:29:24.346 --> 03:29:25.266]  Disarm him!
[03:29:25.466 --> 03:29:26.407]  Get the guards!
[03:29:26.507 --> 03:29:28.328]  Disarm him immediately!
[03:29:28.408 --> 03:29:29.768]  Where's one of the slaves?
[03:29:29.848 --> 03:29:30.689]  Has a weapon?
[03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:32.090]  Crazy, Lord!
[03:29:32.510 --> 03:29:38.093]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[03:29:38.353 --> 03:29:44.016]  And yet having a gunshin' without resumption to know what's going on.
[03:29:45.973 --> 03:29:55.854]  Then I can throw bananas at the global clowns And hear aristocratic moans I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[03:29:57.609 --> 03:30:01.790]  I went looking one day on the internet just to see what I could find.
[03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:07.231]  When I heard this talk show maniac just proudly speaking his mind.
[03:30:08.052 --> 03:30:12.593]  It was really wild but the more I heard it made a whole lot of sense to me.
[03:30:13.213 --> 03:30:17.674]  I want to thank you Alex for opening my eyes and helping the blind to see.
[03:30:19.409 --> 03:30:41.423]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones And you can have an agumption without a presumption To know what's goin' on Then I can throw bananas at the global clowns And hear aristocrats moan I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[03:30:43.854 --> 03:30:52.138]  If you don't get up off your ass and get aggressive now in the inflow war, you're never gonna sit there and kill people or fight, okay?
[03:30:52.238 --> 03:30:55.199]  And I don't want to kill people and I don't want to fight, okay?
[03:30:55.399 --> 03:31:00.601]  So, you know, if I had to defend myself... I mean, I'm not a talker, folks.
[03:31:00.681 --> 03:31:02.062]  I'm actually a fighter, okay?
[03:31:02.562 --> 03:31:04.823]  All this talk is just a shadow of what I'll do in a war.
[03:31:04.863 --> 03:31:10.906]  And I'm not trying to brag here, but... All the talking heads on the TV screen with an arrogance and fisting.
[03:31:12.228 --> 03:31:17.392]  Talkin' about what's been a-goin' on around the world and here in that nation.
[03:31:17.412 --> 03:31:21.755]  They all seem to turn like a pack of wolves when Alex goes on the air.
[03:31:22.455 --> 03:31:27.739]  In spite of the facts, they launch their attacks, and I just don't think it's fair.
[03:31:27.959 --> 03:31:33.623]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[03:31:33.983 --> 03:31:38.487]  And yet, havin' that gumption without a presumption to know what's goin' on.
[03:31:40.598 --> 03:31:45.140]  Then I can throw bananas at the global clowns and hear aristocratic bones.
[03:31:45.620 --> 03:31:50.763]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[03:31:51.043 --> 03:31:55.705]  Yeah, I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[03:31:59.950 --> 03:32:01.471]  I'm your Christian leader!
[03:32:01.812 --> 03:32:03.773]  Never mind skull and bones!
[03:32:04.214 --> 03:32:05.955]  Never mind bohemian growth!
[03:32:06.195 --> 03:32:08.617]  Never mind my actual policies!
[03:32:09.098 --> 03:32:13.741]  Just buy my rhetoric, buy my lies, because you're my slaves!
[03:32:14.202 --> 03:32:19.026]  We're gonna put in a Democrat lady who works for the exact same people, and you're gonna love it when they do it!
[03:32:19.246 --> 03:32:25.331]  All you Democrats that hate the Patriot Act, and all you Democrats that hate the police state, you're certainly gonna love it!
[03:32:36.709 --> 03:32:42.654]  On Alex Jones Exclusive!
[03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:09.512]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:10.053 --> 03:33:11.393]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.635 --> 03:33:16.817]  The blackmail ring of Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:33:18.075 --> 03:33:29.084]  It's just one of many across the United States and the world that go out and compromise leading scientists and academics with underage girls so that they will go along with this agenda.
[03:33:29.764 --> 03:33:31.966]  Because some people can't just be bought off with money.
[03:33:32.566 --> 03:33:33.347]  They've got to be set up.
[03:33:33.387 --> 03:33:35.549]  They've got to have their weaknesses used against them.
[03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:38.910]  So, this is a project of the British Empire.
[03:33:39.230 --> 03:33:40.810]  This is a project of Cecil Rhodes.
[03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:44.511]  This is a project of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:33:44.591 --> 03:33:52.854]  And everything that comes out of that, the Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, Davos, the UN, all promote the exact same agenda.
[03:33:53.214 --> 03:33:56.097]  This year's World Economic Forum has moved online.
[03:33:56.417 --> 03:33:59.881]  It's time to look at the big picture and work collectively.
[03:34:00.341 --> 03:34:04.746]  That's the message from day one of Business Bonanza, the Davos Agenda.
[03:34:05.066 --> 03:34:13.835]  More than 11,000 scientist signatories from around the world, clearly and unequivocally, that our planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.
[03:34:15.351 --> 03:34:21.912]  Climate change is more severe than predicted, and it's accelerating faster than scientists were expecting.
[03:34:22.252 --> 03:34:25.373]  We collected two sets of data over the last 40 years.
[03:34:25.393 --> 03:34:29.034]  Things like population growth, fertility rate, and meat consumption.
[03:34:29.334 --> 03:34:34.535]  And then in parallel, we also looked at atmospheric CO2, nitrous oxide, methane, ice melting.
[03:34:34.935 --> 03:34:37.955]  The data is looking much worse than expected.
[03:34:38.275 --> 03:34:41.136]  So what we have in this paper is a call to action.
[03:34:45.219 --> 03:34:45.700]  I think so.
[03:35:48.982 --> 03:35:54.447]  So, let's go over here and check out the United Nations, and then finally answer that question once and for all.
[03:35:55.207 --> 03:35:57.289]  Which is the most evil organization of all?
[03:35:57.769 --> 03:36:01.793]  Who is really in control of all these other tentacles and heads of the Hydra?
[03:36:02.433 --> 03:36:07.137]  As you enter the United Nations building here in New York, prepare to go through all the security.
[03:36:07.918 --> 03:36:12.402]  Right there, on the building, it says Sustainable Development Goals.
[03:36:12.422 --> 03:36:14.103]  You see that rainbow circle symbol?
[03:36:14.504 --> 03:36:16.806]  That's a sun symbol, or an ancient swastika symbol.
[03:36:17.517 --> 03:36:19.958]  And that's what Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and all of them wear.
[03:36:22.019 --> 03:36:25.841]  And their goals are basically the end of humanity as we know it.
[03:36:27.342 --> 03:36:31.124]  The end of poverty, because most people are going to be dead.
[03:36:31.484 --> 03:36:37.387]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people.
[03:36:37.707 --> 03:36:40.089]  Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey.
[03:36:40.449 --> 03:36:42.270]  It was like, well, it was like...
[03:36:43.170 --> 03:36:44.371]  The Super Friends.
[03:36:44.832 --> 03:36:52.979]  Together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, they're worth more than 125 billion dollars.
[03:36:53.099 --> 03:36:56.522]  That much money, that much power around one table.
[03:36:56.903 --> 03:36:59.245]  It begs the question, what were they doing?
[03:36:59.405 --> 03:37:00.766]  What were they scheming?
[03:37:01.067 --> 03:37:02.408]  Total world domination?
[03:37:02.868 --> 03:37:18.525]  This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity, education, emergency relief, global health, the new Superman and Wonder Woman, the super rich friends, not fighting bad guys, but fighting for good nonetheless.
[03:37:18.945 --> 03:37:26.571]  Apparently one of the things they discussed was what each of them knows about what really works and what doesn't work so they can concentrate their resources.
[03:37:26.811 --> 03:37:35.598]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now but probably increase by the end of the year.
[03:37:36.319 --> 03:37:42.283]  So we have to prepare for a more angry world and I see the need for action.
[03:37:42.424 --> 03:37:44.165]  I see the need for a great reset.
[03:37:44.465 --> 03:37:47.868]  It's important to understand that the UN has a lot of good people working for it.
[03:37:49.295 --> 03:37:50.595]  Just like every institution does.
[03:37:51.295 --> 03:38:10.620]  But it was founded by very, very evil globalists who want to get man to give over our nature that is inclined to love God and to allow a scientific system to take control of our trajectory, to give up our will to them so these engineers can play God.
[03:38:10.640 --> 03:38:15.161]  So I think it's fitting that we have sirens going off in the background because this is an emergency.
[03:38:16.282 --> 03:38:17.422]  Here we have the United Nations.
[03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:25.395]  They're promoting to us their world system.
[03:38:27.918 --> 03:38:32.523]  Will food become a streaming service?
[03:38:33.844 --> 03:38:34.465]  Will nature?
[03:38:35.486 --> 03:38:40.792]  So a prelude to the weather modification that's been going on for more than 70 years that they're now declassifying.
[03:38:43.106 --> 03:38:45.208]  What should the world's diet be?
[03:38:45.888 --> 03:38:49.711]  So the United Nations is telling you, we're going to tell you what your diet is.
[03:38:49.751 --> 03:38:58.377]  And they tell you, you will eat bugs, you will drink sewage, you will have nothing, you will own nothing, and you will like it.
[03:38:59.017 --> 03:39:03.761]  Imagine a world where the richer you are, the less you own.
[03:39:05.069 --> 03:39:14.340]  A world where a fancy car, a large house, and expensive clothes cease to be a status symbol and become a burden.
[03:39:16.022 --> 03:39:24.513]  How would life look like with no belongings, no commodities, no wallet, no assets or property?
[03:39:25.939 --> 03:39:30.702]  A world where the only things you can buy are services and experiences.
[03:39:31.303 --> 03:39:33.664]  The phrase, you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[03:39:33.764 --> 03:39:36.186]  My question is, if I don't own anything, then who does?
[03:39:36.306 --> 03:39:37.447]  Who controls the resources?
[03:39:37.507 --> 03:39:43.151]  Well, it seems like the most obvious answer is the very people who practically own everything now, i.e., members of the World Economic Forum.
[03:39:43.291 --> 03:39:45.913]  No conspiracy, just factual and well-stated intentions.
[03:39:46.673 --> 03:39:50.575]  Is it possible to own nothing but have everything?
[03:39:50.995 --> 03:40:01.460]  The problem is with this video is it's the exact mood of like a dystopian thing that you'd be sort of forced to sit and watch with matchsticks holding your eyes open in a great big terrifying cinema.
[03:41:00.174 --> 03:41:19.152]  The idea that we will own nothing and we will be happy sounds like a terrifying, not Orwellian, but sort of Huxleyan idea that we will be somered into compliance, drugged by a sort of a magical substance in our water into dumb compliance with the objectives of the powerful while we live as kind of human drones.
[03:41:20.199 --> 03:41:27.841]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.
[03:41:28.281 --> 03:41:34.582]  A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[03:41:34.943 --> 03:41:35.643]  Bertrand Russell.
[03:41:37.383 --> 03:41:37.663]  H.G.
[03:41:37.723 --> 03:41:49.126]  Wells, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and hundreds of other eugenicists constantly bragged about how the establishment believed themselves to be a separate, more advanced species than the common man.
[03:41:50.925 --> 03:42:00.234]  Top Eugenicists were bold enough to admit that their real goal was not improving the heredity of the commoner, but to further dumb them down so that they could be more manageable.
[03:42:01.576 --> 03:42:13.648]  Nobel Prize winner Russell wrote at length about how vaccinations filled with mercury and other brain damaging compounds would induce partial chemical lobotomies and develop a servile zombie population.
[03:42:14.727 --> 03:42:23.534]  Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[03:42:23.974 --> 03:42:28.417]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[03:42:28.777 --> 03:42:29.478]  Bertrand Russell.
[03:42:31.019 --> 03:42:38.485]  As a technology product designer, I've started to notice this shift from physical products to digital services.
[03:42:40.157 --> 03:42:49.341]  I believe that as objects become smarter, infused with bits of intelligence and technology, they will transform into services.
[03:42:50.421 --> 03:42:52.562]  Swapped, shared, used.
[03:42:53.042 --> 03:42:56.124]  In the same social way, we swap digital media.
[03:43:02.847 --> 03:43:11.056]  This country, in its 250 years history, has never had traitors as bad as Honore and Millie and Austin.
[03:43:11.276 --> 03:43:22.288]  These men, once they've been politically, culturally, economically, and using the criminal justice system defeated, will be known as the new definition of Benedict Arnold.
[03:43:22.689 --> 03:43:23.549]  They are the plague.
[03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:24.711]  They are a curse.
[03:43:25.311 --> 03:43:31.652]  And they are planning, in my view, false flag terror attacks here in America to cement their rollout against us.
[03:43:31.932 --> 03:43:33.393]  They're spoiling for a war.
[03:43:33.653 --> 03:43:35.113]  They're spoiling for a coup.
[03:43:35.373 --> 03:43:37.114]  They're spoiling to overthrow.
[03:43:37.354 --> 03:43:48.176]  And they're getting ready to carry out terror attacks, that is their handlers are, to be blamed on those of us that are loyal Americans in our opposition to the destruction of the country and the sellout of the nation.
[03:43:48.456 --> 03:43:55.184]  And they're all over television saying Trump questioning the election is an act of terror and he's going to be dealt with by the military.
[03:43:55.204 --> 03:43:56.485]  The government's going to kill this guy.
[03:43:56.565 --> 03:44:00.270]  And they're on channel saying we need to get members of Congress using the military.
[03:44:00.370 --> 03:44:04.415]  People sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.
[03:44:04.835 --> 03:44:22.720]  And then General Milley and General Austin and General Honore get up there and click their heels and say, we want to slug out with the American people, and every white person that doesn't salute us is a white supremacist enemy, and we're the Americans, and they're Hitler, and we're going to get them!
[03:44:22.880 --> 03:44:24.581]  We're ready for war!
[03:44:24.801 --> 03:44:25.661]  Turn us loose!
[03:44:25.681 --> 03:44:26.822]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[03:44:26.942 --> 03:44:28.822]  We're going to get America!
[03:44:28.982 --> 03:44:30.743]  Death to America, says Milley!
[03:44:30.943 --> 03:44:32.543]  Death to America, says Austin!
[03:44:32.743 --> 03:44:34.224]  Death to America, says Honore!
[03:44:49.574 --> 03:44:57.757]  To chronicle the treason and anti-american activities of General Honore, Austin, and Milley, it would take years.
[03:44:58.357 --> 03:45:01.398]  Let us examine only one small data point.
[03:45:01.899 --> 03:45:16.264]  The gun confiscation that took place after the Katrina hurricane, where peaceful people, high and dry, under the orders of Honore, had their firearms stolen and taken from them, never to be returned.
[03:45:16.284 --> 03:45:19.125]  The police and National Guard going street by street
[03:45:20.802 --> 03:45:28.069]  House to house, sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn and instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[03:45:28.369 --> 03:45:30.010]  You say guns will be taken?
[03:45:30.051 --> 03:45:31.292]  No one will be able to be armed.
[03:45:31.512 --> 03:45:32.553]  We will take all weapons.
[03:45:32.853 --> 03:45:39.759]  And now Honoré is organizing the national response for the Democratic Party for gun confiscation.
[03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:44.944]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[03:45:46.845 --> 03:45:48.706]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[03:45:49.166 --> 03:45:52.327]  In the end, police took their weapons, but let them stay in their homes.
[03:45:52.967 --> 03:45:57.728]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[03:45:59.348 --> 03:46:02.449]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[03:46:02.749 --> 03:46:10.251]  All of a sudden, they were banging on the front door, the side door, and the back door, and they said, let us in.
[03:46:13.047 --> 03:46:14.888]  I said, it's not even loaded!
[03:46:15.389 --> 03:46:17.410]  I really thought they were going to kill me.
[03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:18.210]  They took them.
[03:46:19.691 --> 03:46:21.252]  And they didn't have a right to take them.
[03:46:21.272 --> 03:46:22.693]  They didn't have a reason to take them.
[03:46:22.713 --> 03:46:24.514]  You never expect to do this in your own country.
[03:46:25.015 --> 03:46:29.457]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[03:46:29.778 --> 03:46:35.541]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're going to have to do if somebody pops around the corner.
[03:46:35.581 --> 03:46:37.302]  I mean, shoot an American.
[03:46:37.943 --> 03:46:38.063]  Yeah.
[03:46:38.823 --> 03:46:41.964]  You know them by their fruits, as Christ said.
[03:46:41.984 --> 03:46:44.905]  A leopard never changes its spots.
[03:46:45.445 --> 03:46:50.786]  Here, in focus, is the treason of Honore against the Second Amendment and America.
[03:46:50.806 --> 03:46:52.166]  Info Wars!
[03:46:52.626 --> 03:46:53.587]  Info Wars!
[03:46:54.067 --> 03:46:55.027]  Info Wars!
[03:46:55.487 --> 03:46:56.427]  Info Wars!
[03:46:56.867 --> 03:46:57.808]  Info Wars!
[03:46:58.248 --> 03:46:59.188]  Info Wars!
[03:47:04.508 --> 03:47:08.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:09.136 --> 03:47:10.438]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:14.878 --> 03:47:19.900]  First, we're going to implant them in our clothes, that is, wearables, as we say.
[03:47:20.640 --> 03:47:26.902]  And then we could imagine that we implant them in our brains or in our skin.
[03:47:27.042 --> 03:47:36.485]  And in the end, maybe there is a direct communication between our brain and the digital world.
[03:47:36.525 --> 03:47:42.507]  What we see is a kind of fusion of the physical, digital and biological worlds.
[03:47:43.081 --> 03:47:52.065]  That is the official policy of the UN and their spokesperson, Klaus Schwab, who formerly headed up a major United Nations department.
[03:47:52.425 --> 03:47:54.266]  So what should the world's diet be?
[03:47:55.746 --> 03:47:58.227]  Will sustainability create equality?
[03:47:59.428 --> 03:48:02.589]  Oh, they want to make us all equal, equally enslaved.
[03:48:04.330 --> 03:48:09.632]  Will machine learning regrow ancient forests, you see?
[03:48:10.092 --> 03:48:11.273]  They're going to play God.
[03:48:12.540 --> 03:48:15.441]  They're going to take control of your cells, your body.
[03:48:15.741 --> 03:48:17.642]  This is their religion of transhumanism.
[03:48:18.022 --> 03:48:19.563]  Should we patent nature?
[03:48:19.603 --> 03:48:20.923]  Well, Bill Gates is already doing it.
[03:48:21.403 --> 03:48:23.064]  Is farming political?
[03:48:23.184 --> 03:48:26.045]  Why is Bill Gates the biggest landowner in the United States?
[03:48:26.425 --> 03:48:27.926]  Why are they buying up the food?
[03:48:28.466 --> 03:48:30.707]  Why are they telling us we're soon going to be eating bugs?
[03:48:31.187 --> 03:48:34.809]  Two billion people around the world supplement their diet with insects.
[03:48:35.849 --> 03:48:40.391]  Now a new report says creepy crawlies can help avoid a potential global food crisis
[03:48:41.325 --> 03:48:43.028]  Communes instead of cities?
[03:48:43.929 --> 03:48:48.376]  Big plastic camps that we all live in where computers tell us how we live?
[03:48:49.017 --> 03:48:51.120]  That's gonna be fair, but who programs the computers?
[03:48:52.642 --> 03:48:53.704]  That is the program.
[03:48:55.026 --> 03:48:55.486]  The plan.
[03:48:57.008 --> 03:49:13.488]  The operation being pushed by these transhumanists who've set themselves up as the priest class, as the gods, and we must bow down to them and give up our humanity as sacrifices to them, and then they will dole out the advanced technology like Moses from the mountain down to us mere mortals.
[03:49:14.090 --> 03:49:22.436]  We are now still fighting the virus, but we can be rather optimistic after what we have seen with the announcement of vaccines.
[03:49:22.936 --> 03:49:28.139]  Now we have to think how to structure, how to design the post-corona era.
[03:49:28.720 --> 03:49:33.603]  And here, of course, the word reset comes to my mind, because one thing is clear.
[03:49:33.963 --> 03:49:36.605]  We cannot come back to the old normal.
[03:49:36.945 --> 03:49:43.530]  We have to use this opportunity, as our parents and grandparents have done after the World War II.
[03:49:44.311 --> 03:49:49.092]  To really reflect on what went wrong and what could we do better.
[03:49:49.821 --> 03:49:51.583]  There's only one more thing the U.N.
[03:49:51.623 --> 03:49:55.866]  loves more than pedophilia, sex slavery, and human trafficking.
[03:49:56.547 --> 03:49:57.388]  And that's genocide.
[03:49:58.129 --> 03:50:02.472]  They've executed and ran genocides in Africa, in Asia, and in Latin America.
[03:50:02.973 --> 03:50:04.214]  It's their job with U.N.
[03:50:04.254 --> 03:50:07.737]  peacekeepers to go in and kill whole villages that won't turn their property over.
[03:50:08.238 --> 03:50:10.740]  It's their job to carry out the forced inoculations.
[03:50:11.381 --> 03:50:15.664]  They ran the Rwandan massacre in the early 1990s, working with the Clintons.
[03:50:16.567 --> 03:50:28.291]  The United Nations is the greatest criminal organization the planet has ever seen, and it fits like hand and glove with the communist Chinese, North Koreans, and other authoritarians across the world.
[03:50:28.971 --> 03:50:40.135]  The United Nations was a criminal organization founded by eugenicist globalists for the express goal of a tyrannical, oppressive world government to carry out forced depopulation.
[03:50:40.615 --> 03:50:45.077]  The United Nations is the enemy of every man, woman, and child in every sovereign state.
[03:50:45.777 --> 03:50:49.938]  The United Nations is the sword of death.
[03:50:51.059 --> 03:51:13.746]  We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[03:51:14.699 --> 03:51:23.465]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison.
[03:51:23.725 --> 03:51:26.427]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[03:51:26.447 --> 03:51:28.489]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[03:51:28.589 --> 03:51:33.092]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[03:51:33.252 --> 03:51:35.994]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[03:51:36.054 --> 03:51:41.998]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[03:51:42.398 --> 03:51:50.526]  An epidemic, either naturally caused or intentionally caused, is the most likely thing to cause, say, 10 million excess deaths.
[03:51:50.946 --> 03:51:56.071]  Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.
[03:51:57.412 --> 03:51:59.114]  Instead, it looks like this.
[03:52:01.536 --> 03:52:11.502]  If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
[03:52:12.223 --> 03:52:15.845]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[03:52:19.198 --> 03:52:26.979]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario, because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[03:52:26.999 --> 03:52:46.543]  Now the good news is, not to bring up depression, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism.
[03:52:50.666 --> 03:52:52.326]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[03:52:52.366 --> 03:52:53.507]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[03:52:53.547 --> 03:52:54.607]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[03:52:54.647 --> 03:52:56.007]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[03:52:56.027 --> 03:52:56.807]  And Joe Rogan?
[03:52:57.027 --> 03:52:57.508]  Elon Musk?
[03:52:57.668 --> 03:52:58.748]  You know where they tune in, right?
[03:52:59.048 --> 03:53:03.529]  They tune in right here!
[03:53:03.629 --> 03:53:04.389]  InfoWars.
[03:53:04.769 --> 03:53:05.649]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:53:05.949 --> 03:53:06.310]  Today.
[03:53:06.330 --> 03:53:12.231]  I've got a proposal for viewers and listeners that is one of the most important proposals you'll ever get in your life.
[03:53:12.711 --> 03:53:16.812]  I know how good it works because I finally listened to Dr. Edward Grubb.
[03:53:17.899 --> 03:53:23.322]  Seven, eight years ago, when he said to me, Alex, you're exercising a lot, but you're overweight.
[03:53:24.082 --> 03:53:26.603]  You probably have a deficiency in high quality iodine.
[03:53:26.643 --> 03:53:29.504]  Most iodine is bound into the soil or into the food.
[03:53:29.624 --> 03:53:30.445]  You're not absorbing it.
[03:53:30.485 --> 03:53:32.426]  Most people have iodine deficiencies.
[03:53:32.466 --> 03:53:41.410]  He showed me articles where the UN admits that 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities and lower IQ because of low iodine in utero and after they were born and as adults.
[03:53:41.570 --> 03:53:44.932]  And so I finally started taking Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[03:53:44.952 --> 03:53:55.337]  He was the only guy to ever actually go out and find an oil company that was digging it out of the ground at 7,000 to 12,000 feet, versus most folks getting it out of seaweed, which still has some good effects, but not as good as what he had.
[03:53:55.417 --> 03:53:56.418]  Well, we have it today.
[03:53:56.518 --> 03:53:58.599]  And that's Survival Shield X2.
[03:53:58.799 --> 03:54:03.542]  Survival Shield X2 is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[03:54:03.622 --> 03:54:06.243]  It's 100% Deep Earth Crystal True Nascent Iodine.
[03:54:06.323 --> 03:54:10.104]  But then we developed, working with other scientists, X3.
[03:54:10.564 --> 03:54:12.765]  Now, I'm not saying X2 is better than X3.
[03:54:12.825 --> 03:54:14.566]  They're apples and oranges.
[03:54:14.626 --> 03:54:21.148]  And we have X2 at 50% off in stock with free shipping right now, part of our 4th of July Super Sale.
[03:54:21.528 --> 03:54:26.752]  I was able to get in a bigger order of X3 because it's become a big seller over the years.
[03:54:26.912 --> 03:54:35.459]  It's got the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine with two other types of clean, good iodine that are better for some people than just one type of iodine.
[03:54:35.619 --> 03:54:42.624]  Some people can't absorb the pure iodine, the atomic iodine, and they need the other types of naturally occurring iodine.
[03:54:42.685 --> 03:54:47.228]  This has all three, so it's apples and it's oranges.
[03:54:47.288 --> 03:54:49.250]  It's not, is an apple better, is an orange better?
[03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:52.432]  Or is a potato better or tomato better?
[03:54:52.552 --> 03:54:55.055]  Or are black grapes better than green grapes?
[03:54:55.215 --> 03:54:57.317]  Or is this type of squash better than that squash?
[03:54:57.417 --> 03:55:00.019]  It's two different things, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:00.119 --> 03:55:04.163]  I'd liken it to regular yellow gold being gold, and you got white gold.
[03:55:04.283 --> 03:55:06.004]  It's gold, it's just silver looking.
[03:55:06.085 --> 03:55:10.508]  I mean, it's very similar, but it's two different things at the molecular level.
[03:55:10.569 --> 03:55:12.090]  And that's just my goofy way of breaking it down.
[03:55:12.210 --> 03:55:16.471]  So, I want to challenge listeners and I want to challenge viewers to support the broadcast.
[03:55:16.511 --> 03:55:19.432]  Hell, go to m4warstore.com, right in the middle section right there.
[03:55:19.452 --> 03:55:23.353]  You can become a sponsor and make a one-time gift of $10, $50, $100 to fund us.
[03:55:23.413 --> 03:55:28.074]  That way, after credit card fees and stuff, we get about 95% of it to actually fund what we're doing.
[03:55:28.114 --> 03:55:30.575]  If you make a $5 donation, we get over $4 of it.
[03:55:30.635 --> 03:55:38.317]  With the products, we only get a fraction of that because obviously we got to pay for the shipping and the handling and the crew and the infrastructure and the cost of the product.
[03:55:38.337 --> 03:55:40.818]  So, what I'm saying is, we can't do this without you.
[03:55:41.198 --> 03:55:48.267]  And we've got really, really, really great products that will empower you and your family at the very same time.
[03:55:48.727 --> 03:55:51.311]  And those are X2 and X3.
[03:55:51.671 --> 03:55:56.938]  If you don't know about the bad halogens, fluoride, bromide, chlorine, there's a whole list of them.
[03:55:57.338 --> 03:56:03.542]  They hurt you, they give you cancer, they take over your thyroid, they take over your hypothalamus, they attack your organs.
[03:56:04.143 --> 03:56:11.127]  And if your body doesn't have iodine, it will absorb the bad halogens that Big Brother and the New World Order make sure in everything we do.
[03:56:11.568 --> 03:56:14.149]  And all these products, all the plastics and the water.
[03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:19.213]  So, the good part about having this iodine is it blocks those and pulls those out of the body.
[03:56:19.713 --> 03:56:31.359]  For adults, for children, for everybody, you need these iodine products, X2 and X3, 50 and 60% off, respectively, with free shipping, double Patriot points, through July 4th, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:56:31.399 --> 03:56:32.599]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:56:32.679 --> 03:56:37.541]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com now and order X2 and X3 and some of the other great products.
[03:56:37.601 --> 03:56:38.662]  Thank you all for your support.

[03:56:48.826 --> 03:56:57.734]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide.
[03:56:57.754 --> 03:57:02.838]  That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course the rest is history.
[03:57:02.938 --> 03:57:03.899]  Our film, Endgame,
[03:57:04.019 --> 03:57:04.199]  I think?
[03:57:20.117 --> 03:57:20.577]  We're good.
[03:57:52.932 --> 03:57:56.714]  It's hard to believe that July 4th, 2021 is almost here.
[03:57:58.696 --> 03:58:02.018]  It's hard to believe that our country is literally fighting for its life.
[03:58:03.138 --> 03:58:07.801]  But for all the negative things that are happening, a lot of really positive things are happening as well.
[03:58:08.422 --> 03:58:13.485]  It's been said by many historians that things have to get really, really bad before they get better.
[03:58:13.945 --> 03:58:16.947]  And we're now reaching that point of return, that tipping point.
[03:58:17.087 --> 03:58:17.948]  Global government
[03:58:18.652 --> 03:58:22.073]  And it's planetary depopulation plan is now out in the open.
[03:58:22.533 --> 03:58:25.293]  And people realize the time for fun and games is over.
[03:58:25.313 --> 03:58:31.634]  That's why I wanted to report to you, the listeners and viewers of this transmission, the good news today, as well as the bad news.
[03:58:32.294 --> 03:58:43.836]  I've been contacted in the last two weeks by some of the top people in international media and national news as well, as well as some of the folks at the highest levels of government, corporations, the private sector, you name it.
[03:58:44.256 --> 03:58:45.717]  And they've all told me the same thing.
[03:58:46.257 --> 03:58:47.017]  Alex, keep it up.
[03:58:48.035 --> 03:58:52.847]  You've been vindicated and we're having a major breakthrough thanks to your work.
[03:58:53.569 --> 03:58:57.739]  Well, I wanted the listeners to know that it's you that have allowed this to happen.
[03:58:58.240 --> 03:58:59.804]  You have been just as important as I've been.
