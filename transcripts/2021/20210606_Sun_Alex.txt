[00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:19.734]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:20.374]  Wow!
[00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:24.635]  Do we have just over-the-top important information to cover today?
[00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:26.156]  It's Sunday, June 6th.
[00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:27.376]  The year is 2021.
[00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:29.356]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:31.977]  I'll be here for the next two hours live.
[00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:35.798]  Then, Sunday live with Owen Schroer, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:37.099]  Central as well.
[00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.379]  Okay.
[00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.451]  Wow!
[00:00:39.451 --> 00:01:02.209]  You'll definitely want to click below and share the live link of this feed if you're watching at freeworldnews.tv or band.tv or infowars.com forward slash show and you'll definitely want to tell locals also wherever you live you're listening on AM or FM radio or watching local TV it isn't part of the victory it's all of the victory
[00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.748]  Because if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it fall, did it make a sound?
[00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:07.569]  Same thing.
[00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:12.072]  We have the holy water.
[00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.172]  We have the crosses.
[00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.073]  We have the garlic.
[00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:18.476]  We have the sunshine that'll vaporize these psychic vampires.
[00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:24.120]  But we've got to get it out there to the people, and that's where you come in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.461]  Wow!
[00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.843]  President Trump, I would say, has re-emerged.
[00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:55.798]  And has put out a string of powerful videos over the weekend, one which is extremely cryptic in that soon we will take control of the White House again sooner than you think, meaning obviously as evidence mounts that there was proven election fraud, and as evidence mounts that Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent, and as evidence mounts that Fauci working with Obama and others
[00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.011]  Launched COVID-19 to try to bring down the U.S.
[00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:04.293]  and embarrass President Trump and bring in the Great Reset that they're going to be removed.
[00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:20.978]  So this is an incredible statement by Trump and you add that into China hit us with this virus and a lot of the president's surrogates, he is the real president, that's just a fact, are now coming out and saying it was obviously released on purpose and this was all done by design and
[00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.862]  Mainstream news now saying, we bet the Deep State launches a cyber attack, we bet the Deep State's behind the cyber attacks, which obviously it is.
[00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:35.143]  The Deep State's just corporate criminals worldwide, James Bond villains, but for real.
[00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:40.025]  As all of this comes out, we're in an insane time.
[00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:43.466]  This is an incredibly dangerous time, an incredibly amazing time.
[00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.067]  A lot of good things are happening, a lot of bad things.
[00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:52.269]  Everybody better be praying for awakening, for peace, for justice, and for protection of our children particularly.
[00:02:53.021 --> 00:03:02.570]  And that other eyes be opened, other hearts be opened, other minds be opened, and that we reject this evil that's being injected into us by the New World Order.
[00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.935]  All this cultural evil, all the propaganda, the human-animal cloning that's now being announced everywhere.
[00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:13.000]  I mean, they're really making their move in their transhumanist revolution to play God.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.762]  But first, let's get to the big clip.
[00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.003]  Here's Trump cryptically.
[00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:21.747]  It looks like a hotel ballroom releasing several cryptic statements.
[00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:24.848]  We'll get to some more of them later, but here's the big one.
[00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:28.488]  I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support you've shown.
[00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:37.010]  We're going to take back the Senate, take back the House, we're going to take back the White House, and sooner than you think, it's going to be really something special.
[00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.351]  But the love and the affection and the respect that you've given all of us
[00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:43.965]  It's really important.
[00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:50.772]  The Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been, and it's going to be a lot stronger than it is right now.
[00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:51.894]  We're going to turn it around.
[00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:53.675]  We're going to turn it around fast.
[00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:55.057]  Thank you all very much.
[00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:57.559]  That support has been so incredible.
[00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.920]  Thank you.
[00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:00.262]  That is a big deal.
[00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:26.447]  That is a declaration of war against the deep state that has said, they've said it publicly, if he continues to run the Republican Party and goes around the country getting other good members elected to the House and Senate and gubernatorial positions and legislative positions and corporate positions, pushing people to those positions, that they're going to indict his son, him, Giuliani, I guess he didn't have a dog, but the dog if he had one, they'll indict a ham sandwich.
[00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:31.247]  That they're going to go after Trump with those indictments if he doesn't back down.
[00:04:31.247 --> 00:04:34.789]  Well, he's not backing down, so you got to admire that.
[00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.729]  Trump's got his problems.
[00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.030]  God doesn't have them.
[00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.071]  Like, don't go along with that idiot, demon Fauci.
[00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.733]  But other than that, I mean, they don't want him in there.
[00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:45.695]  And boy, don't you wish we had him now with what Biden and all these criminals are doing.
[00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:47.355]  There is so much to cover.
[00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:48.836]  There's also more good news.
[00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:54.419]  Huge federal court ruling overturning California's ban on AR-15s.
[00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.080]  So a lot of good things happening.
[00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:13.580]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.560]  history.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.161]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:21.322]  America is under globalist takeover.
[00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.108]  It's an information war.
[00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:24.169]  It is an economic war.
[00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.733]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:33.100]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.603]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:38.287]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:39.228]  We were the first to lay out
[00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:43.797]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:46.859]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:51.241]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:55.524]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[00:05:55.524 --> 00:06:00.387]  So, to all the veterans and all the Patriots, we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.329]  It is Sunday, June 6th.
[00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:16.450]  Thank you so much for joining us in the middle of this incredible year that is the year 2021.
[00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.650]  Wow!
[00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.751]  The globalists stole the election.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:48.009]  They're trying to destroy populace all over the world, but the planet, the universe, humanity, is a two-way street.
[00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:57.439]  And we are discovering our power, and we are fighting back in the intellectual war, the economic war, and the spiritual war as well.
[00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:01.683]  Thank you so much for joining us again here on the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:11.725]  We'll be here for the next two hours ahead of Sunday Live, another two hours of live Sunday night radio slash TV analysis with Owen Schroyer.
[00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:27.209]  Find all the showtimes, links, videos, articles, and forbidden, verboten information at freeworldnews.tv, which takes you right to band.tv, but you can't share band.tv on Twitter or Facebook or other places, so the new URL that takes you there is
[00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:34.434]  FreeWorldNews.tv and every link has its own little special link to get around the censors.
[00:07:34.434 --> 00:07:45.300]  And of course, if you're watching this later as a recorded program, once we have archives of it up, just click the link below and share it because that is half the battle.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.560]  And Big Tech hopes you don't.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.701]  Oh, okay.
[00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.142]  Let me just tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:55.505]  First, Trump has re-emerged and I've been very upset the last four months to see him basically
[00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:12.239]  In dry dock, but he's 74 years old, and he looks a lot better now, and he's lost 30 pounds and looks 10 years younger, so maybe he's a little smarter than I am, but he has taken a rest, and he has now roared back out with three incredible announcements.
[00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:17.142]  One that Republicans will be back in the White House a lot sooner than you think.
[00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:19.303]  Wow, that's a quote.
[00:08:19.303 --> 00:08:22.045]  Looking right at the camera, meaning we're going to overturn the fraudulent election.
[00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:25.827]  That is just huge, huge, huge, huge.
[00:08:26.693 --> 00:08:34.999]  Then he comes out and says China should have to pay reparations for launching the Wuhan bio-weapon attack.
[00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:37.641]  As the understanding of that now becomes mainstream.
[00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.664]  And he also says who the hell's running the White House because Biden isn't.
[00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:51.512]  And that dovetails with his statement about we'll have him out of there soon because it's not just 25th Amendment, it's the fact that he is a CHICOM agent.
[00:08:51.512 --> 00:08:53.053]  He lied to Congress.
[00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:54.034]  Others lied to Congress.
[00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.315]  His appointees lied to Congress.
[00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:04.506]  Like the Attorney General, who knows damn well, and had seen the documents, that Biden did meet with Chinese officials for money.
[00:09:04.506 --> 00:09:07.529]  I mean, the whole rotten ship is going down.
[00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:10.431]  There's no way they're getting away with what they've done.
[00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:13.373]  There's no way they're going to be able to reverse all this.
[00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:18.256]  So, that's coming up.
[00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.058]  Let me do this though.
[00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:25.302]  Let me tell you what else I'm going to get to, and then I'm going to hit the free speech area that's really ripened now.
[00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.513]  To an extremely important level, if we act now.
[00:09:32.513 --> 00:09:39.297]  And so before I get to that big piece of news, let me just explain this to the wonderful listeners and incredible viewers.
[00:09:39.297 --> 00:09:49.323]  If you notice, everything we talk about a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, is now word-for-word mainstream news.
[00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:54.066]  That is because almost no one else at this level covers this information.
[00:09:54.961 --> 00:10:10.653]  And so we put it out, it percolates others' research, and then when it becomes safe to put it out, folks that are not against humanity and not against God, and not against their own self-interest, by the way, they're just common sense, are able to then put the information out.
[00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:12.094]  That's why InfoWars
[00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:15.150]  I was thinking about this last night and this morning.
[00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:24.836]  Infowars is so incredibly important, and this morning I was thinking about saying this on air, and I said, you know, you really shouldn't say this because they'll come after you even more, but they already know.
[00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:27.277]  The enemy knows.
[00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:33.841]  That's why Trump was forbidden, according to the Chief of Staff at the time, General Kelly and others, to
[00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:45.415]  Even be able to see InfoWars because it was so accurate and would tell him what was right under his nose, how he was being spied on illegally, how they were really Chinese agents, the rest of it.
[00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:53.499]  And so you need to understand that when you support this broadcast and when you share the articles and videos, you have changed the world.
[00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:54.360]  You have fought back.
[00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.953]  And it seems like a small thing to promote a radio show, a small thing to share articles, but it's not.
[00:10:58.953 --> 00:11:00.254]  It's a big thing.
[00:11:00.254 --> 00:11:02.696]  Especially when you get attacked or censored yourself for it.
[00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.137]  But it's a life and death thing.
[00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:07.179]  It's because it's being censored that you need to promote it.
[00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:10.562]  So I want to just say this at the start of the broadcast here.
[00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:12.624]  I do not get the credit for this.
[00:11:12.624 --> 00:11:13.945]  And this is important.
[00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:14.945]  I know you don't want credit.
[00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:15.446]  You're just like me.
[00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:20.203]  You want freedom and justice for your children and grandchildren in the future.
[00:11:20.203 --> 00:11:22.063]  And you hate seeing evil take over.
[00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:23.044]  I understand.
[00:11:23.044 --> 00:11:29.666]  But you need to let it soak in that the audience of this broadcast is not an audience.
[00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:32.367]  You are fighters.
[00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:40.931]  You are people that have literally not lived in the bleachers, not sat there in the peanut gallery, but you have been the men and women in the arena.
[00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:41.691]  And I don't care
[00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:57.866]  If you're an old lady living in a trailer park in Indiana, or you're a black man living in a tiny apartment in Chicago, or you're a Hispanic person living in Austin, Texas, who lives in a shack, I don't care what kind of car you got, or if you don't have a car, or any of that.
[00:11:57.866 --> 00:12:07.072]  I care about, do you care about freedom, and do you want to stand up for what you know is right, that your conscience tells you is right, because God created you.
[00:12:07.072 --> 00:12:08.233]  And God gave you a directive.
[00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:15.061]  If that's the case, and you spread the word, and you take action, it changes the world.
[00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:17.924]  So, I salute you!
[00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:19.745]  That is not empty words.
[00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:24.209]  That is not something to make you feel good.
[00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:26.952]  That is something that's the truth, and that you need to recognize.
[00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:34.098]  Because when I see the awesome power of InfoWars, despite all my problems and all of it, God still rose me up to do this, just like He's done you.
[00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:44.154]  And I see how we've affected change and how InfoWars is the dominant, countervailing zeitgeist to Satan's zeitgeist.
[00:12:44.154 --> 00:12:55.303]  InfoWars is the fount, is the progenitor, is the detonation point for the modern resistance now and going into the future.
[00:12:55.303 --> 00:12:59.947]  And I want you to understand that you are InfoWars.
[00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:02.328]  You are the resistance.
[00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:02.829]  This crew,
[00:13:03.823 --> 00:13:12.406]  All of you, the radio stations, the affiliates, the sponsors, the people praying for us, you have done incredible things.
[00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:15.807]  And I just want it to soak in.
[00:13:15.807 --> 00:13:21.389]  So when you got made fun of, or you lost your job for what you did, or any of that stuff, it was worth it.
[00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:22.630]  Because God's watching.
[00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.171]  And because it's actually bearing fruit.
[00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.592]  Now stuff's gonna get hellish.
[00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:29.712]  But it's gonna do that anyway.
[00:13:29.712 --> 00:13:30.433]  Satan's real.
[00:13:30.433 --> 00:13:31.493]  I mean, Satan's making a move.
[00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:37.770]  Everything we do is going to lighten how bad what we're going to go through as a civilization is going to be.
[00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:54.837]  Because we're going to live and see the Mark of the Beast, Satan's world government, you will see the Antichrist, you will see one-fourth of the Earth's population killed, you will see giant pillars and mountains of fire that John the Revelator witnessed when God took him to the future to see it.
[00:13:56.648 --> 00:13:58.009]  And it's going to be rough.
[00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:06.396]  And I don't know if it's a year from now or 20 from now, but I'm telling you this right now, it's all moving fast that direction.
[00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:08.618]  You're like, well, then why do we, why do we fight it?
[00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:10.800]  Well, it's our job to fight it.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.186]  And it's in that process of struggling with it that it crests and wins for just a very short period of time.
[00:14:18.186 --> 00:14:23.230]  Satan gets up there on that pinnacle of power and he has to have his panopticonic
[00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:33.647]  Counterfeit of God, total surveillance, artificial AI, artificial omnipresence.
[00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:38.791]  It's a cheap shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow, but it will be something like it.
[00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:42.674]  Predicts the future, people under its control, it can control the future.
[00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:46.698]  Once humans act like automatons, it will dominate and control them.
[00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:51.922]  This thing is going to build, it's going to work for a while, and then it's going to disintegrate.
[00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:54.960]  They'll be able to cure cancer, they tell you.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.001]  And in a couple years, that person will die a violent death from side effects.
[00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:04.163]  They'll be able to do all, oh, promise they can download your soul and do a computer.
[00:15:04.163 --> 00:15:06.844]  All of this is a fraud.
[00:15:06.844 --> 00:15:10.505]  All of this is a lie, and we are going to be here to witness and to see it.
[00:15:10.505 --> 00:15:13.546]  It's going to be spectacular.
[00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:14.666]  So don't let it get you down.
[00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:17.327]  Don't let it get you depressed.
[00:15:17.327 --> 00:15:20.848]  Don't let it get you in the position of
[00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:28.479]  Where you absorb all this evil, and then you feel bad, and you feel depressed, and you commit suicide.
[00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:30.200]  Don't do that.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.841]  Commit yourself to fight against the New World Order.
[00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:32.482]  Warn others.
[00:15:32.482 --> 00:15:33.002]  Love others.
[00:15:33.002 --> 00:15:33.683]  Have justice.
[00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.824]  Bring light into the world.
[00:15:34.824 --> 00:15:37.887]  And know that it's a process, and that we're going to go through this.
[00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:40.449]  It's going to make us much, much stronger, and much, much closer to God.
[00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:42.624]  Thank you all for your support as well.
[00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:44.164]  Buying the products keeps us on air.
[00:15:44.164 --> 00:15:45.885]  The big sale ends tomorrow.
[00:15:45.885 --> 00:15:47.966]  Storewide free shipping actually ends tonight.
[00:15:47.966 --> 00:15:50.767]  Double Patriot Points, 40% off.
[00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:53.828]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off some of the other products.
[00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.628]  That sale ends tonight.
[00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:08.396]  Memorial Day 2021 is here, and that means store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points at InfowarStore.com.
[00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:16.878]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:23.500]  And that's a good thing because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for yourselves, good for your body.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.224]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[00:16:28.224 --> 00:16:31.066]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:33.028]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[00:16:33.028 --> 00:16:34.929]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:36.070]  The list goes on and on.
[00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:41.635]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:43.316]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[00:16:43.316 --> 00:16:44.917]  What else is back in stock?
[00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:46.218]  People are very excited to hear.
[00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:49.445]  I always shoot you straight.
[00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:52.908]  And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[00:17:06.562 --> 00:17:12.964]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[00:17:12.964 --> 00:17:15.164]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[00:17:15.164 --> 00:17:17.225]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[00:17:17.225 --> 00:17:18.005]  It's okay.
[00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:20.386]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[00:17:20.386 --> 00:17:22.446]  We're having a great effect.
[00:17:22.446 --> 00:17:23.586]  We're exposing evil.
[00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:24.827]  You're exposing evil.
[00:17:24.827 --> 00:17:33.509]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:33.969]  So again,
[00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:55.323]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[00:17:55.323 --> 00:17:56.784]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:59.026]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[00:18:01.062 --> 00:18:09.285]  You've got until June 6th to get free shipping double Patriot Points and up to 50% off on our best-selling products.
[00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:21.330]  DNA Force Plus, that is the highest quality, ultimate product you can get for your telomeres, your cells, the mitochondria, the engines of your cells, PQQ, CoQ10, so much more.
[00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.790]  It's the flagship product.
[00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.832]  It is 40% off with free shipping double Patriot Points.
[00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:28.092]  Pollen Block for seasonal discomfort, allergies.
[00:18:28.092 --> 00:18:29.173]  It's a national system.
[00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:30.133]  People love it.
[00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:31.553]  Five-star reviews.
[00:18:31.553 --> 00:18:32.354]  Back in stock.
[00:18:32.354 --> 00:18:33.334]  Forty percent off.
[00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:34.574]  Again, with free shipping.
[00:18:34.574 --> 00:18:35.314]  All these products.
[00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.075]  Storewide.
[00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:37.015]  Free shipping.
[00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:37.975]  Double page rate points.
[00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:41.716]  Vazobeats for your heart, your liver, your cardiovascular.
[00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:47.957]  It creates a key compound in your blood that is known as a detoxifying system.
[00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:49.118]  It's all there.
[00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:51.718]  But again, look into Vazobeats with the nitrous oxide.
[00:18:51.718 --> 00:18:53.419]  That's fifty percent off.
[00:18:53.419 --> 00:18:53.999]  All for twelve.
[00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:54.519]  Back in stock.
[00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:55.679]  Fifty percent off.
[00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:59.180]  This is running until Sunday and the deal's over at bulwarkstore.com.
[00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.812]  I've been on air 27 years.
[00:19:02.812 --> 00:19:07.454]  And we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[00:19:07.454 --> 00:19:11.035]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:18.897]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[00:19:18.897 --> 00:19:22.599]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:28.961]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:33.394]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:36.175]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:40.758]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[00:19:40.758 --> 00:19:43.901]  And so, InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[00:19:43.901 --> 00:19:47.403]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:49.284]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[00:19:49.284 --> 00:19:50.505]  It's so expensive.
[00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:55.809]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:55.809 --> 00:19:59.451]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-month free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:20:02.872 --> 00:20:15.537]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.537 --> 00:20:26.382]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.182 --> 00:20:38.063]  And tracks!
[00:20:38.063 --> 00:20:38.943]  And radio!
[00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:44.927]  LRWWCR transmitters, 100,000 watts.
[00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:50.550]  There's only one station with 100,000 watts in America, and we're on it.
[00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.911]  All the other big ones are 50,000 watts.
[00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:52.852]  We're talking about AM.
[00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:54.533]  There's definitely 100,000.
[00:20:54.533 --> 00:20:54.793]  Oh yeah.
[00:21:08.712 --> 00:21:10.813]  What if I told you they were lying?
[00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:12.154]  Woo!
[00:21:12.154 --> 00:21:13.134]  Anthrax!
[00:21:13.134 --> 00:21:13.774]  And radio!
[00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.435]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[00:21:15.435 --> 00:21:16.476]  Anthrax!
[00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.897]  Alright, I'm gonna stop it.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.761]  There's a good clutch.
[00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:39.261]  Burlesters.
[00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:43.344]  I had the clutch center on like 10 years ago.
[00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:46.226]  Good guys.
[00:21:46.226 --> 00:21:48.528]  Smart guys.
[00:21:48.528 --> 00:21:51.610]  Better look out.
[00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.190]  All right.
[00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:59.155]  Let me stop talking about that and get serious here because I kind of, I didn't, I didn't get rabbit trail, but, but, but just let me tell you what's coming up.
[00:21:59.155 --> 00:22:03.598]  I'm going to hit the Trump news next segment where he says Biden's about to be out of office.
[00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:07.081]  I mean, that's just like, whoa, I saw that last night.
[00:22:08.937 --> 00:22:12.259]  And I just fell out of my chair.
[00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:22.827]  I mean, the implications of that, what that means, Trump wouldn't just say that if he wasn't going to try it.
[00:22:22.827 --> 00:22:32.954]  Trump better have really good Secret Service coverage because they were scared to kill him when he was in office.
[00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:34.535]  And if they kill him, it'll make him a martyr.
[00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:35.656]  But I've weighed the
[00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:40.803]  Globalist mindset.
[00:22:40.803 --> 00:23:03.369]  I've looked into their bean counting, their abacus, and you could say the scales of their arithmetic, and the topography of their navigation of their political wilderness, and I just don't see how they don't try to kill him.
[00:23:03.369 --> 00:23:07.030]  Because they're desperate.
[00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.070]  They want to maintain control.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.201]  The fact they launched that bio attack is coming out.
[00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:23.865]  But let me hit this big piece of news first, because this is so important to Congress and to the House and Senate, to America, to the world, and it really is what we face.
[00:23:23.865 --> 00:23:25.866]  This is what globalism is.
[00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:30.227]  It's unaccountable corporate governance.
[00:23:30.227 --> 00:23:33.808]  I believe in libertarian ideas when it comes to social issues and things.
[00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:36.449]  I'm a live and let live person.
[00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:38.050]  But when it comes to governance,
[00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:46.228]  Corporations simply become government when they're left unchecked by government.
[00:23:46.228 --> 00:24:04.613]  So we need a limited government, a republic to protect us from the equivalent of the modern East India Company, which became more powerful than pretty much the British Empire itself, and became its own military, its own governance, its own unaccountable system.
[00:24:04.613 --> 00:24:04.933]  Reason
[00:24:06.184 --> 00:24:07.484]  Doesn't really come from government.
[00:24:07.484 --> 00:24:10.565]  Government's just raw power, the raw execution.
[00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:14.485]  Well, under corporate governance, that's what you really end up with.
[00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:34.149]  So, people can argue about Section... in the legislation, in the law, where Big Tech has all these different systems, where they are given immunity.
[00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.469]  Section 230.
[00:24:36.863 --> 00:24:41.126]  And we can harp on that all day, and people have been harping on that.
[00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:50.212]  Instead of going, how does Big Tech lie to Congress and say they don't spy on anybody, or collect any data, or sell that data when on record that's their business and they do?
[00:24:50.212 --> 00:24:54.775]  It's like saying, cows aren't cows, or the sky isn't blue.
[00:24:54.775 --> 00:24:59.017]  I mean, it's next level.
[00:24:59.017 --> 00:25:00.658]  It's absolutely next level.
[00:25:00.658 --> 00:25:02.980]  And I kind of went off this segment
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:14.308]  Singing along to the Klutz song, so I'm a little bit... Had a false start this segment.
[00:25:14.308 --> 00:25:21.773]  So, this next piece of news is so big that I'm not going to cover it until the next segment.
[00:25:21.773 --> 00:25:30.059]  And then I'm going to cover the huge Trump news, and I'm going to just restart the broadcast when we come back after the break that's coming up in a few minutes.
[00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:32.141]  Because this has got to be said just right.
[00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:42.521]  Because I've been harping on this and I've been explaining this to people and I've been going over this ad nauseam and no one has listened to me in Congress.
[00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:43.662]  Trump wouldn't listen to me.
[00:25:43.662 --> 00:25:49.367]  I have given this speech to
[00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.311]  Former heads of U.S.
[00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:54.814]  intelligence agencies, I've given the speech at dinner with U.S.
[00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:56.375]  senators off record.
[00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:59.298]  I've given the speech with top talk show host off record.
[00:25:59.298 --> 00:26:07.444]  I've given the speech everywhere till I'm blue in the face and no one seems to understand what I'm saying.
[00:26:07.444 --> 00:26:09.126]  And finally I got up this morning
[00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:16.530]  And I turned on my little devilish iPad and there was Ted Cruz saying it right out of his mouth.
[00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:22.234]  And you know, you can talk about Ted Cruz and some people don't like him and he stabbed Trump in the back and all that.
[00:26:22.234 --> 00:26:23.295]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:23.295 --> 00:26:28.039]  Ted Cruz is probably the smartest person in government.
[00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:29.940]  Rand Paul's really smart as well.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.684]  I mean, quite frankly, they're both politically and intellectually way smarter than Trump.
[00:26:35.684 --> 00:26:36.165]  Trump has
[00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:39.562]  Really good instincts and some things.
[00:26:39.562 --> 00:26:50.376]  But as sneaky as Cruz is, you just can't ignore the fact that he would be an incredible president if he actually worked for us.
[00:26:50.376 --> 00:26:53.379]  And I think Cruz wants to work for America.
[00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:54.501]  I think he believes the idea.
[00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:58.735]  I think he believes enough in himself that he doesn't want to try to hold other people back.
[00:26:58.735 --> 00:27:03.520]  Because that's the real mark of a man, is that you don't want to suppress other people because you're insecure.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.742]  I would like to see Ted Cruz as president one day.
[00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:14.391]  Even though he's attacked me and all the rest of it, and he's also defended me, I just know that he would run circles around the globalists if we got him in there.
[00:27:16.221 --> 00:27:23.546]  But obviously he also has, he doesn't have some of that destiny like Trump has, like he bet on Glenn Beck.
[00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:24.827]  He also has some blind spots.
[00:27:24.827 --> 00:27:27.048]  But Ted Cruz has learned a lot.
[00:27:27.048 --> 00:27:28.369]  We all learn.
[00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:29.970]  I've learned a lot.
[00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:37.415]  But Ted Cruz presented the world on Fox News this weekend the keys to freedom.
[00:27:37.415 --> 00:27:38.236]  The keys to everything.
[00:27:38.916 --> 00:27:54.052]  Because see, now I figured out why when I was saying I was libertarian, because I like the ideas of it, it makes sense at one level, so you understand how complex things are and that power always amasses and always, whether it's communism or fascism or corporatism or whatever it is, it always masses together and becomes authoritarian.
[00:27:55.434 --> 00:28:00.158]  And so the globalists spent billions and billions pushing libertarian thought.
[00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:01.960]  So, oh, leave corporations alone.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.521]  We don't need any regulations on them.
[00:28:03.521 --> 00:28:10.507]  And when you see the local socialist agenda 21 code enforcer not letting you cut a tree down in your backyard that fell on your house,
[00:28:11.247 --> 00:28:18.732]  In a storm, you go, hey, the tree fell over and Austin says, sorry, it doesn't matter the tree got struck by lightning or there was a tornado.
[00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:22.154]  You've got to replace it with that many inches of tree.
[00:28:22.154 --> 00:28:24.635]  And you're like, a 30-inch oak?
[00:28:24.635 --> 00:28:26.976]  I don't have the money to buy a 30-inch oak.
[00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:29.318]  And you're like, I don't like government.
[00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:30.819]  Government sucks.
[00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:31.639]  Yeah.
[00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:35.802]  And then corporations become just like that and behave just the same.
[00:28:35.802 --> 00:28:37.443]  So you've got to have some type of balance there.
[00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:41.182]  I'm digressing.
[00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:45.585]  I'm going to try to cut right to the heart of the matter, because this is a very simple issue.
[00:28:45.585 --> 00:28:49.067]  But if the world gets it, it's over for the New World Order.
[00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:52.850]  Because I figured out their plan with this libertarian thing.
[00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.752]  Because, I've said it over again, I am not a large L libertarian anymore.
[00:28:56.752 --> 00:28:57.593]  Because I figured this out.
[00:28:59.858 --> 00:29:08.484]  Memorial Day 2021 is here, and that means store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points at InfowarStore.com.
[00:29:08.484 --> 00:29:16.969]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[00:29:16.969 --> 00:29:23.614]  And that's a good thing because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[00:29:23.894 --> 00:29:28.317]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[00:29:28.317 --> 00:29:31.159]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:33.121]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:35.022]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[00:29:35.022 --> 00:29:36.163]  The list goes on and on.
[00:29:36.163 --> 00:29:41.727]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot Points.
[00:29:41.727 --> 00:29:43.409]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[00:29:43.409 --> 00:29:45.010]  What else is back in stock?
[00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.731]  People are very excited to hear.
[00:29:46.731 --> 00:29:47.472]  Pollen Block.
[00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:51.295]  I share with you, the viewers and listeners, the facts of where InfoWars is.
[00:29:51.295 --> 00:29:56.981]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[00:30:11.684 --> 00:30:21.920]  So in short, the world's awakening, despite all the censorship, InfoWars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the globalist agenda and fighting it.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.641]  But that said...
[00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:27.361]  The COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains, has almost shut us down.
[00:30:27.361 --> 00:30:33.425]  Because most of the best-selling products, which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[00:30:33.425 --> 00:30:34.445]  Well, guess what?
[00:30:34.445 --> 00:30:38.067]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, after seven months.
[00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:41.009]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:46.872]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:30:46.872 --> 00:30:48.293]  And Alpha Power's back in stock.
[00:30:48.653 --> 00:30:59.180]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.900]  history.
[00:31:14.188 --> 00:31:18.789]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:21.550]  America is under globalist takeover.
[00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.730]  It's an information war.
[00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.790]  It is an economic war.
[00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.371]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:32.732]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[00:31:32.732 --> 00:31:35.172]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[00:31:35.172 --> 00:31:37.893]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[00:31:37.893 --> 00:31:38.833]  We were the first to lay out
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.760]  Fauci is the first big domino.
[00:32:03.078 --> 00:32:05.439]  It's just teetering on the edge of collapse.
[00:32:05.439 --> 00:32:08.781]  And if he falls, the entire House of Cards goes down.
[00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:20.348]  There's a viral report we put out a month ago that's the blueprint for bringing these criminals down, dealing with Peter Daszak, the project manager of the Wuhan Lab, under funding from Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:32:20.348 --> 00:32:21.869]  And it's all coming out in the emails.
[00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:23.290]  But we don't need the emails.
[00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:29.314]  Turns out he bragged a year and a half ago how they created a 5-virus chimera, now known as COVID-19.
[00:32:30.234 --> 00:32:37.798]  Peter Daszak is the final little domino to knock over the first big one Fauci that could bring home a whole new world order.
[00:32:37.798 --> 00:32:42.380]  We're covering it all now at band.video and freeworldnews.tv.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.022]  That's the URL to share, freeworldnews.tv.
[00:32:45.022 --> 00:32:50.784]  Get this out to everybody you know, the world's awakening, and now is the time for you to be the Paul Reveres.
[00:32:50.784 --> 00:32:52.665]  So I'm firing the bat signal now.
[00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:55.847]  Get this report that's on screen and get out to everyone you know.
[00:32:55.847 --> 00:32:59.269]  Smoking Gun Video, Fauci Project Manager, confesses to creating COVID-19.
[00:33:03.906 --> 00:33:19.372]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:24.233]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:25.674]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.162 --> 00:33:38.585]  Infowars, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:43.508]  All right, let me just tell you what's coming up next hour.
[00:33:43.508 --> 00:33:52.733]  West Point is putting people in solitary confinement that don't take the deadly gene therapy, genetic engineering, frankenshots.
[00:33:52.733 --> 00:34:00.738]  And Indian towns that refuse the inoculation, because the town elders are, there's video throwing out the UN injectors.
[00:34:03.346 --> 00:34:14.591]  They're having their power cut off for not taking the voluntary injections and it's all over the news that they're going to start doing similar things here in the United States.
[00:34:14.591 --> 00:34:17.333]  This is a giant exercise in tyranny.
[00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:24.776]  If they can put something in your body that's experimental and secret on top of it, they can do anything.
[00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:31.259]  And now massive new studies have come out from prestigious institutes saying
[00:34:32.328 --> 00:34:34.009]  This is a mistake.
[00:34:34.009 --> 00:34:35.110]  It was done on purpose.
[00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.651]  But see, they're good scientists.
[00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:39.352]  They're like, this is a mistake.
[00:34:39.352 --> 00:34:44.115]  It's causing an autoimmune response in the body of these spike proteins.
[00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:47.417]  And these proteins are all in the body, and the body is eating holes in itself.
[00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:48.998]  The brain, the lungs, and the heart.
[00:34:48.998 --> 00:34:50.059]  This is terrible!
[00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.663]  Why are you doing it?
[00:34:52.663 --> 00:35:10.190]  Fauci did studies at UT in 2012 and the studies said do not ever create a vaccine that tries to block a cold virus protein because the virus is made out of the same stuff as your body!
[00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.911]  Good God!
[00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:16.513]  And that's why so many people I know that are smart are freaking out.
[00:35:16.513 --> 00:35:18.234]  I have trouble.
[00:35:18.234 --> 00:35:20.315]  I sat there today for like an hour staring out the window.
[00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:22.708]  Just like, why are they doing this?
[00:35:22.708 --> 00:35:25.410]  I mean, the heart attacks, the death, it's depopulation.
[00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.232]  It's real simple.
[00:35:27.232 --> 00:35:28.293]  And it's an IQ test.
[00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:33.477]  If you're dumb enough to take this stuff, they think you deserve to die.
[00:35:33.477 --> 00:35:38.180]  And again, it killed rats on average in a couple months.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.003]  And rats, a couple months is like a couple years in humans.
[00:35:41.003 --> 00:35:42.664]  And it's a dead reckoning thing, but that's why they do it.
[00:35:43.848 --> 00:35:45.729]  And it telegraphs the studies to do that.
[00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:51.932]  So, I mean, Dr. Tenpenny says six months to a year, other scientists, Wolfgang Woodarks says about a year.
[00:35:51.932 --> 00:35:58.236]  Yidan, the former head of Pfizer, our chief scientist, he said, yeah, I think about a year.
[00:35:58.236 --> 00:36:02.137]  If you look at the rat studies, it's a month or two with rats and about a year or two with humans.
[00:36:02.137 --> 00:36:04.058]  I mean, we're going to just see dead people everywhere.
[00:36:04.058 --> 00:36:09.041]  I mean, oh, oh, oh, oh, and it's all, it's like, oh, there's mystery illnesses that are causing strokes.
[00:36:09.461 --> 00:36:16.605]  And heart attacks and people becoming like Alzheimer's patients when they're 10 years old, 30 years old.
[00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:20.968]  Mystery neurological disorders in Europe and the UK and the US.
[00:36:20.968 --> 00:36:22.749]  Suddenly hospitals are full.
[00:36:22.749 --> 00:36:24.130]  There's an RT headline.
[00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.511]  It's happening and it's probably spreading.
[00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:30.434]  Canadian health officials baffled by mystery deadly brain disease.
[00:36:31.613 --> 00:36:36.075]  I probably said a hundred times last year, they'll call it Mystery Neurological Disorders.
[00:36:36.075 --> 00:36:43.177]  It's all happening like a damn slow motion train wreck!
[00:36:43.177 --> 00:36:46.118]  See, I'm not one of these guys that says, stay with us all, I'm going to cover it next hour.
[00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:48.559]  I just got to it right then, but I'm going to show you all the articles next hour.
[00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:50.800]  Let's get to this right now.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.421]  And I wasn't gushing earlier over Ted Cruz.
[00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.902]  It's just satisfying to see somebody that gets it.
[00:36:55.902 --> 00:36:59.103]  And all the time, no one gets what I'm saying but Ted Cruz.
[00:36:59.103 --> 00:37:00.904]  And I'm not kissing his ass, it's just that, my God,
[00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:04.356]  You're like, thrown overboard into the ocean, you know, you grab on to whatever you can get.
[00:37:04.356 --> 00:37:08.180]  And, you know, here it is, Ted Cruz, Fauci emails show Facebook operating as extension of government, now exposed to legal liability.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:08.320]  Bingo!
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.440]  Bingo!
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:20.992]  Bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing
[00:37:22.885 --> 00:37:43.734]  All these big tech corporations are working and partnered with government, usually whatever party's in power, to suppress their political enemies, to suppress their financial enemies, to suppress their technological enemies, which is violation of trust, trust laws, and surveillance laws they're violating, and they've now become government institutions!
[00:37:43.734 --> 00:37:47.116]  Facebook has three billion members!
[00:37:47.116 --> 00:37:51.458]  It bans speeches in Congress and scientists that speak and
[00:37:52.085 --> 00:37:58.268]  DeSantis has a hearing with a bunch of scientists and Fauci doesn't like it, so they ban that off YouTube?
[00:37:58.268 --> 00:38:01.389]  This is incredible governmental meddling!
[00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:11.374]  If the FBI ran the post office and wouldn't let you mail letters criticizing Fauci, you'd say, you'd get rid of the FBI, right?
[00:38:11.374 --> 00:38:12.695]  The FBI would get in trouble for that, right?
[00:38:13.942 --> 00:38:15.583]  Well, this is just digital mail.
[00:38:15.583 --> 00:38:16.865]  Oh, but it's a free corporation.
[00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:18.406]  You're talking to somebody.
[00:38:18.406 --> 00:38:20.327]  They're surveilling you in live time.
[00:38:20.327 --> 00:38:21.528]  Facebook admits.
[00:38:21.528 --> 00:38:25.212]  And then even saying in their internal documents, well, we really want to suppress the truth.
[00:38:25.212 --> 00:38:26.252]  You know, doesn't matter.
[00:38:26.252 --> 00:38:27.574]  They're telling their fact checkers.
[00:38:27.574 --> 00:38:30.836]  Listen, we're really worried about people being truthful.
[00:38:30.836 --> 00:38:37.162]  So suppress it, particularly compelling, truthful narratives that block people taking their shots.
[00:38:37.162 --> 00:38:37.642]  Oh, really?
[00:38:37.642 --> 00:38:40.084]  Like, hey, my wife took it and she's dead.
[00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.185]  Well, don't let them.
[00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.126]  Don't let them show that.
[00:38:44.071 --> 00:39:00.521]  So here's Ted Cruz explaining to the Fox News host that, do you understand that Facebook is meshed with bureaucracies and government agencies in live time suppressing the people of the country?
[00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:01.621]  And what we say?
[00:39:01.621 --> 00:39:03.642]  That's Ceausescu's Romania!
[00:39:03.642 --> 00:39:05.563]  That's Kim Jong-un's North Korea!
[00:39:05.563 --> 00:39:07.345]  That's Xi Jinping's China!
[00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.985]  That's Stalin's Russia!
[00:39:08.985 --> 00:39:10.326]  That's Hitler's Germany!
[00:39:10.326 --> 00:39:11.367]  I mean, this is
[00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:15.550]  The Muhammad Ali, he's the greatest boxer?
[00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.730]  Like that's the standard?
[00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:19.330]  Well, this is the Muhammad Ali of Tyrant.
[00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:25.072]  I mean, this is, when you're doing that in live time, baby, I mean, there's a ceiling on this.
[00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:27.412]  That's like as high as you can get.
[00:39:27.412 --> 00:39:30.813]  It's as bad as it is.
[00:39:30.813 --> 00:39:34.734]  And Congress's sister goes, is it true you track us with the phones?
[00:39:36.537 --> 00:39:38.518]  Sundar, the head of Google, goes, no!
[00:39:38.518 --> 00:39:40.779]  We've never tracked anyone's phone!
[00:39:40.779 --> 00:39:43.180]  And the Senator goes, thank you for telling me that!
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.281]  I heard!
[00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:45.741]  You do it!
[00:39:45.741 --> 00:39:53.145]  I mean, these people, most of these judges, most of these Senators, are literally morons.
[00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:56.066]  They were put in power because they're idiots.
[00:39:56.066 --> 00:39:58.607]  And because they'll do whatever the globalists say.
[00:39:58.607 --> 00:40:04.450]  But, but, I'm sorry, the full Ted Cruz interview is like 10 minutes long, it's on Infowars, but here's part of it, here it is.
[00:40:05.726 --> 00:40:08.928]  First, here's the Fauci flip-flop over a two-week period.
[00:40:08.928 --> 00:40:11.270]  Watch.
[00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:21.137]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain-of-function research and if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina.
[00:40:21.137 --> 00:40:28.662]  And if you look at the grant and you look at the progress reports, it is not gain-of-function despite the fact
[00:40:29.222 --> 00:40:30.862]  That people tweet that?
[00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:35.563]  It would have been almost a dereliction of our duty if we didn't study this.
[00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:40.124]  And the only way you can study these things is you've got to go where the action is.
[00:40:40.124 --> 00:40:49.046]  So we had a modest collaboration with very respectable Chinese scientists who are world experts on coronavirus.
[00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:53.307]  And we did that through a sub-grant from a larger grant to EcoHealth.
[00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:57.182]  Wow.
[00:40:57.182 --> 00:40:57.783]  Okay.
[00:40:57.783 --> 00:41:00.746]  Joining me right now to discuss this is Senator Ted Cruz.
[00:41:00.746 --> 00:41:03.809]  He sits on the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees.
[00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:05.231]  Senator, good morning to you.
[00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:06.912]  It is wonderful to see you this morning.
[00:41:06.912 --> 00:41:09.215]  I want to get right into the Facebook connection.
[00:41:09.215 --> 00:41:12.198]  But first, Senator, tell us, did Fauci commit perjury just there?
[00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:15.764]  It sure looks like it.
[00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:19.647]  He looked at Rand Paul's eyes and told a flat-out falsehood.
[00:41:19.647 --> 00:41:26.833]  And unfortunately, this has been a pattern with Dr. Fauci, that what he says on Monday somehow isn't the same as what he says on Tuesday.
[00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:30.096]  But don't worry, what he says on Wednesday is almost certain to be different.
[00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:36.479]  And I gotta say, this email dump that came out makes clear that this is not just being sloppy.
[00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:42.463]  It is systematic, and it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people.
[00:41:42.463 --> 00:41:46.865]  And as you noted, he wasn't doing it alone, but he was doing it with much of the U.S.
[00:41:46.865 --> 00:41:50.107]  government behind him, and with Facebook and big tech.
[00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:53.174]  Operating as an extension of the U.S.
[00:41:53.174 --> 00:42:09.675]  government, in order to silence any views that disagreed, not with the science, because he wasn't looking for the science, he was suppressing the science, but rather trying to silence anything that disagreed with the political narrative that was convenient that he was pushing at that moment.
[00:42:11.619 --> 00:42:19.007]  And then Cruz goes on to explain in the law, now that they've done that, they've totally opened themselves up to liability, to FOIA requests, to everything.
[00:42:19.007 --> 00:42:24.973]  You can't have the government, imagine if the government teamed up with the Dallas Cowboys to spy on you.
[00:42:24.973 --> 00:42:29.458]  You'd be like, arrest Jerry Jones.
[00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.120]  But if it's Facebook or Twitter, oh, then it's okay.
[00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:42.570]  They hired over a million trained fact-checkers in the last three years, four years, by the ADL and Southern Property Law Center to now run all the big tech and be in your private accounts reading your private messages?
[00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.892]  I mean, this is a giant spy scandal!
[00:42:44.892 --> 00:42:52.378]  And it's government all linked up with the corporations doing it and then hiding behind that corporate wall saying it's a private company.
[00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:52.958]  No, it's not!
[00:42:52.958 --> 00:43:00.004]  It's a criminal mafia cabal!
[00:43:00.004 --> 00:43:01.145]  I always shoot you straight.
[00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:05.968]  And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:13.142]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[00:43:13.142 --> 00:43:15.324]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[00:43:15.324 --> 00:43:17.385]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[00:43:17.385 --> 00:43:18.186]  It's okay.
[00:43:18.186 --> 00:43:20.568]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[00:43:20.568 --> 00:43:22.630]  We're having a great effect.
[00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.771]  We're exposing evil.
[00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:24.992]  You're exposing evil.
[00:43:24.992 --> 00:43:33.699]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[00:43:33.699 --> 00:43:34.140]  So again,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:55.479]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:56.981]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[00:43:56.981 --> 00:43:59.183]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:03.627]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[00:44:03.627 --> 00:44:06.850]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:20.744]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 frankenshot.
[00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:22.286]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:31.033]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the pranking shots.
[00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:32.593]  They don't trust it.
[00:44:32.593 --> 00:44:33.933]  You shouldn't trust it.
[00:44:33.933 --> 00:44:36.654]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[00:44:36.654 --> 00:44:39.815]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[00:44:39.815 --> 00:44:43.637]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:44.877]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[00:44:45.982 --> 00:44:51.789]  Around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refuse to take the vaccines.
[00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:52.229]  That's right.
[00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:56.153]  The doctors, nurses, scientists do not trust the so-called vaccines.
[00:44:56.153 --> 00:44:57.495]  And you shouldn't either.
[00:44:57.495 --> 00:44:58.916]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:11.772]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Pollen Block is, but you should go to InfoWarsTore.com and read the third-party review sites that we have links to where it's got five stars and people love it.
[00:45:11.772 --> 00:45:20.261]  Pollen Block is a proprietary formula from France where they just learned by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet
[00:45:21.104 --> 00:45:28.909]  Produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies.
[00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:30.009]  It's back in stock.
[00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:31.170]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.271]  It's very hard to get.
[00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:34.012]  Despite that, it's 40% off.
[00:45:34.012 --> 00:45:38.795]  We have store-wide free shipping right now for Memorial Day and Double Patriot Point.
[00:45:38.795 --> 00:45:40.556]  So Pollen Block is back in stock.
[00:45:40.556 --> 00:45:41.857]  So is DNA Force.
[00:45:41.857 --> 00:45:43.017]  So are so many other great products.
[00:45:43.017 --> 00:45:44.218]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:45:44.218 --> 00:45:45.679]  And your purchase funds the InfoWars.
[00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:48.741]  So that is a true 360 win.
[00:45:48.741 --> 00:45:50.442]  Get your Pollen Block today.
[00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:54.619]  I've been on air 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[00:46:07.483 --> 00:46:11.026]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:18.914]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[00:46:18.914 --> 00:46:22.617]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[00:46:22.617 --> 00:46:32.787]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[00:46:33.394 --> 00:46:36.155]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[00:46:36.155 --> 00:46:40.756]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:43.897]  And so, InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[00:46:43.897 --> 00:46:47.398]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[00:46:47.398 --> 00:46:49.278]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[00:46:49.278 --> 00:46:50.499]  It's so expensive.
[00:46:50.499 --> 00:46:55.800]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.441]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-month free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:47:03.434 --> 00:47:17.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:17.517 --> 00:47:20.217]  It's Sunday, June 6th.
[00:47:20.217 --> 00:47:21.658]  The year is 2021.
[00:47:21.658 --> 00:47:28.159]  You're a sentient, conscious being that can interface with God and God's creation universe.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:40.842]  As we spin through space on this beautiful planet, orbiting a standard yellow star, two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[00:47:40.842 --> 00:47:42.702]  The waltz goes on forever.
[00:47:42.702 --> 00:47:51.744]  And if we go with God's design, you're happy.
[00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:54.605]  And it pleases God, and it pleases us.
[00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.825]  If we go against God's code, it's called sin.
[00:47:58.266 --> 00:48:03.068]  And it's wages are death.
[00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:04.688]  You see that?
[00:48:04.688 --> 00:48:07.169]  You do what the system says, you die.
[00:48:07.169 --> 00:48:10.090]  Both physically and spiritually.
[00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.731]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:26.136]  I just played a little bit of that Ted Cruz clip, but you know, I'm gonna do something because Cruz and his guest, or he's the guest, the host, really lay it all out in the first five minutes of the interview.
[00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:26.316]  How
[00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:33.221]  Whether it's COVID-19, or whether it's election fraud, or whether it's the Second Amendment, or whether it's Antifa existing.
[00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:36.442]  You know, they gaslight us and go, Antifa doesn't exist.
[00:48:36.442 --> 00:48:38.863]  These are mostly peaceful protests.
[00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:41.584]  Second biggest burndown of the cities in U.S.
[00:48:41.584 --> 00:48:42.684]  history.
[00:48:42.684 --> 00:48:47.805]  And then if you go, oh look, here's Antifa beating up an old lady.
[00:48:47.805 --> 00:48:52.567]  Twitter takes your Twitter account away from Savannah Hernandez.
[00:48:53.863 --> 00:48:55.203]  Oh, we can't have her.
[00:48:55.203 --> 00:49:01.285]  She's a conservative, smart, good-looking Latina who's out showing these thugs beating up women.
[00:49:01.285 --> 00:49:06.467]  Well, we'll just ban her for them.
[00:49:06.467 --> 00:49:14.529]  Same thing they do whenever all the footage comes out on the national news.
[00:49:14.529 --> 00:49:18.270]  They try to edit it and cut it down and claim Republicans are out burning things down.
[00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.511]  I mean, the level of lies is insane.
[00:49:21.523 --> 00:49:24.926]  And Jack Dorsey and all these people are protecting that.
[00:49:24.926 --> 00:49:28.629]  They are protecting Twitter.
[00:49:28.629 --> 00:49:30.911]  Congresses.
[00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:32.433]  And they're protecting Facebook.
[00:49:32.433 --> 00:49:34.094]  And they're protecting it.
[00:49:34.094 --> 00:49:36.836]  And it's doing illegal things.
[00:49:36.836 --> 00:49:43.842]  Facebook and Google particularly are light years worse than Twitter with the data mining and the activities they're involved in.
[00:49:43.842 --> 00:49:46.945]  So, always hit behind and that's fine.
[00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.907]  I'm going to hit the huge Trump news next hour.
[00:49:49.995 --> 00:49:52.356]  The first part of it that I'm going to hit.
[00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:56.338]  The military news, the global destabilization news, the clear hack attacks.
[00:49:56.338 --> 00:50:00.261]  Now even mainline analysts are saying they're coming from corporations in the deep state.
[00:50:00.261 --> 00:50:03.562]  Why do we keep thinking governments are the ones hacking things?
[00:50:03.562 --> 00:50:06.264]  Or governments are the ones destabilizing things?
[00:50:06.264 --> 00:50:07.645]  It's global corporations.
[00:50:07.645 --> 00:50:09.806]  They're bigger than governments.
[00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:12.647]  Facebook has 3 billion members.
[00:50:12.647 --> 00:50:16.149]  You really think Zuckerberg really runs that?
[00:50:16.149 --> 00:50:17.690]  You really think Biden's running anything?
[00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:22.895]  Let's start talking about who stands to gain from the lockdowns.
[00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:24.256]  The big corporations.
[00:50:24.256 --> 00:50:25.817]  Doubled and tripled their profits.
[00:50:25.817 --> 00:50:28.219]  That's how you gotta start thinking.
[00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:31.701]  Key Bono.
[00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:34.404]  But look at these headlines.
[00:50:34.404 --> 00:50:41.389]  Twitter declares access to its platform a human right amid censorship of conservatives.
[00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:46.273]  And when I saw that headline come out Friday night,
[00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:58.705]  Before I even read the headline, I knew what it was going to say.
[00:50:58.705 --> 00:51:09.753]  They want to be able to overthrow governments by manipulating who gets political support and who doesn't, and letting their operatives run flash mobs, and then Twitter sends that message to everybody that's in the particular country.
[00:51:09.753 --> 00:51:12.715]  Just like the Arab Spring, they admit Twitter worked with Google and Facebook to
[00:51:13.428 --> 00:51:24.858]  Throw out moderates, put radical Muslims in, and then blow up hundreds of churches in one week alone in... where was it?
[00:51:24.858 --> 00:51:26.879]  Egypt and other areas.
[00:51:26.879 --> 00:51:34.846]  So, all the tie-dyes and all the trendy outfits and all of it is a cover that this is a mechanized army.
[00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:42.014]  If space aliens landed and were wearing tie-dyes, I'd just bow down to them.
[00:51:42.014 --> 00:51:46.098]  Or if Hitler wore tie-dyes, I'd be like, well, Hitler's gonna kill me, but it's okay.
[00:51:46.098 --> 00:51:53.705]  He's got a shaved Buddhist head and a big Buddha beard, and you know, he's wearing an electric orange-yellow tie-dye.
[00:51:53.705 --> 00:51:54.506]  It's okay.
[00:51:54.506 --> 00:51:58.890]  He lets the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, 50,000 of them at Twitter alone.
[00:52:01.007 --> 00:52:01.988]  It's in the news.
[00:52:01.988 --> 00:52:05.911]  A million-plus have been trained for big tech across the board.
[00:52:05.911 --> 00:52:12.937]  ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, trains them in a two-month course in the last four years, and then they are in your computer.
[00:52:12.937 --> 00:52:14.219]  They are in your private messages.
[00:52:14.219 --> 00:52:21.705]  They are in your email, if you use Gmail, and they are watching you, and they're admitting they're watching you.
[00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:25.028]  And then they get upset if you criticize them and ban you.
[00:52:26.027 --> 00:52:39.783]  They're bullies, they're thugs, they're cult leaders, they're capturing us, they're imprisoning us, they're training us to live in a prison, a digital surveillance prison, and now they've got physical 200 square foot coffin apartments ready for us.
[00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:49.161]  Oh, but it's trendy, and the people selling it are wearing tie-dyes, so it must be okay.
[00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:54.224]  They're not hippies living in some VW bus out by the river.
[00:52:54.224 --> 00:52:56.405]  They're not anti-war people.
[00:52:56.405 --> 00:52:57.566]  They're not non-threatening.
[00:52:57.566 --> 00:52:58.907]  They're evil.
[00:52:58.907 --> 00:53:02.269]  They're powerful.
[00:53:02.269 --> 00:53:07.472]  And they learn to look non-threatening.
[00:53:07.472 --> 00:53:09.293]  It's called camouflage.
[00:53:12.043 --> 00:53:18.171]  And as soon as you figure that out, the smarter you're going to be and the more you've got a chance of surviving.
[00:53:18.171 --> 00:53:22.777]  But I digress.
[00:53:22.777 --> 00:53:23.818]  Think about that statement.
[00:53:23.818 --> 00:53:29.285]  Twitter declares access to its platform a human right amid censorship of conservatives.
[00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:31.808]  And they say, here it is, Twitter policy.
[00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:35.949]  We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.
[00:53:35.949 --> 00:53:40.971]  Access to the free and open internet is an essential human right in modern society.
[00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:43.252]  Hashtag open internet.
[00:53:43.252 --> 00:53:50.015]  We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.
[00:53:50.015 --> 00:53:50.855]  But you know what they found out?
[00:53:51.395 --> 00:54:01.941]  Twitter was banning pro-government people with an AI program by the hundreds of thousands in Africa's most populous nation.
[00:54:01.941 --> 00:54:18.931]  Just like Twitter and Facebook ban members of the UK Parliament and members of our President's band, you've got in Australia they're banning members of Parliament that simply say we shouldn't have endless lockdown and masks don't work.
[00:54:18.931 --> 00:54:19.251]  Oh!
[00:54:19.251 --> 00:54:20.852]  The UN says you're not allowed to say that!
[00:54:22.173 --> 00:54:27.854]  Again, the UN says we can say, the UN says we can do.
[00:54:27.854 --> 00:54:29.974]  Think about that.
[00:54:29.974 --> 00:54:37.896]  So you need to go watch the full Ted Cruz video because they get into all of that, but you're probably thinking what I'm thinking.
[00:54:37.896 --> 00:54:42.156]  This is pretty oxymoronic.
[00:54:42.156 --> 00:54:51.158]  It's hypocritical, it's paradoxical to sit there and to say to you that
[00:54:52.407 --> 00:54:55.410]  Oh my gosh, we're so concerned about free speech.
[00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.351]  Everyone has a right.
[00:54:56.351 --> 00:54:57.913]  No one should ever be censored.
[00:54:57.913 --> 00:54:59.414]  No one should ever be blocked.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:01.917]  It's a sacred code that we follow.
[00:55:01.917 --> 00:55:02.738]  We're Google.
[00:55:02.738 --> 00:55:03.999]  We're never evil.
[00:55:03.999 --> 00:55:04.780]  And we're Twitter.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.761]  We're never evil.
[00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:07.683]  And then there's just reign of terror!
[00:55:08.463 --> 00:55:19.172]  You know, letting Antifa say where people live, letting Antifa say they're going to come kill people at their houses, letting Antifa say where Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson live and where I live.
[00:55:19.172 --> 00:55:25.997]  And Facebook says, oh, you're allowed to even prepare violence against Alex Jones.
[00:55:25.997 --> 00:55:26.938]  Because they're the liberals.
[00:55:26.938 --> 00:55:28.038]  They're the underdogs.
[00:55:28.038 --> 00:55:30.200]  They're the guys fighting the fascists.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.402]  They're Captain America fighting the Nazis.
[00:55:33.317 --> 00:55:35.940]  Though they're financed by an actual Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.644]  I mean, it's their excuse to act like monsters.
[00:55:39.644 --> 00:55:45.550]  And then Andy Nago gets beat up again, and then, you know, Twitter blocks his account.
[00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:51.577]  Because, you know, you can't show Antifa go to Ashley Babbitt's.
[00:55:52.688 --> 00:55:56.353]  Memorial event and beat people up at the memorial?
[00:55:56.353 --> 00:56:03.342]  No, yeah, Twitter's busy blocking people that show Antifa beating up people at a memorial service for Ashley Babbitt.
[00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.982]  Because their job is gaslighting you.
[00:56:06.982 --> 00:56:08.663]  Their job is controlling you.
[00:56:08.663 --> 00:56:10.443]  Their job is dominating you.
[00:56:10.443 --> 00:56:12.304]  And you need to understand that.
[00:56:12.304 --> 00:56:17.767]  And it's not a bunch of liberals that mean well and, oh, they're not following their own rules and they're confused.
[00:56:17.767 --> 00:56:25.050]  They're corporate, vicious criminals following a psychological warfare operation.
[00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:26.170]  IBM.
[00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.751]  Facebook.
[00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:27.451]  Twitter.
[00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:27.991]  Google.
[00:56:27.991 --> 00:56:29.452]  They're subsidiaries.
[00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:29.692]  Apple.
[00:56:30.499 --> 00:56:33.344]  Apple runs the worst camps.
[00:56:33.344 --> 00:56:38.332]  They've got major international rights groups that do analysis and Apple runs the worst.
[00:56:39.455 --> 00:57:06.330]  Subcontractor facilities, because they demand lower cost, and they demand robots take over, and the Chinese come to them, the communists, and say, you need to just let us have a few dollars more a day for our employees, instead of one dollar, two dollars, and they can have a place to live, and we wouldn't have them committing suicide, and Tim Cook says, put nets up, so they can't kill themselves when they jump off the damn top.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.321]  It's always mitigate us.
[00:57:10.321 --> 00:57:12.301]  Don't respect someone trying to kill themselves.
[00:57:12.301 --> 00:57:13.342]  Don't help them.
[00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:14.522]  Don't make their job better.
[00:57:14.522 --> 00:57:23.125]  Just put nets up so when they try to act out that they won't do it, they'll go somewhere else and kill themselves.
[00:57:23.125 --> 00:57:24.446]  That's a satanic mind.
[00:57:24.446 --> 00:57:25.246]  It's how they operate.
[00:57:25.246 --> 00:57:30.468]  We're going to come right back with our number two.
[00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:32.512]  I'm sure you heard about it.
[00:57:32.512 --> 00:57:36.354]  Twitter suspends organization for announcing they will release more Fauci emails.
[00:57:36.354 --> 00:57:37.495]  They get them via foyer.
[00:57:37.495 --> 00:57:38.295]  It's totally legal.
[00:57:38.295 --> 00:57:39.176]  Shows the criminal.
[00:57:39.176 --> 00:57:40.396]  Oh, you're blocked.
[00:57:40.396 --> 00:57:44.198]  You're not allowed to do that because we wear tie-dye shirts.
[00:57:44.198 --> 00:57:45.059]  I mean, come on.
[00:57:45.059 --> 00:57:46.699]  I wear a tie-dye shirt.
[00:57:46.699 --> 00:57:50.081]  I'm allowed to help murderers.
[00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:53.683]  I am blown away at how effective InfoWars is.
[00:57:53.683 --> 00:57:55.944]  I am humbled by how we're changing the world.
[00:57:56.835 --> 00:58:00.737]  And it's important for you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWar.
[00:58:00.737 --> 00:58:07.279]  When you spread the word, when you financially support us, when you pray for us, you change history.
[00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:17.743]  You give my children and your children and our entire species a chance at the future instead of these evil, post-humanist, exterminist, globalist winning.
[00:58:17.743 --> 00:58:19.244]  And we're giving them a run for their money right now.
[00:58:19.244 --> 00:58:22.465]  So that's why I want to encourage everyone in the month of June 2021
[00:58:24.582 --> 00:58:27.223]  To spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever.
[00:58:27.223 --> 00:58:28.364]  Don't be ashamed of InfoWars.
[00:58:28.364 --> 00:58:31.185]  Be proud of the fact that we have been in so many fights.
[00:58:31.185 --> 00:58:33.426]  And that we've been so bruised and so scarred.
[00:58:33.426 --> 00:58:35.627]  Because those are the signs of our victories.
[00:58:35.627 --> 00:58:36.987]  The signs of your victory.
[00:58:36.987 --> 00:58:40.308]  And also please financially support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:40.308 --> 00:58:41.949]  It's only running through next Monday.

[00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:18.959]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[00:59:18.959 --> 00:59:21.800]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.

[00:59:23.761 --> 00:59:25.662]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.803]  The list goes on and on.
[00:59:26.803 --> 00:59:32.365]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:59:32.365 --> 00:59:33.486]  That's an unprecedented deal.

[01:00:07.518 --> 01:00:07.798]  All right.
[01:00:07.798 --> 01:00:08.799]  Welcome back.
[01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:09.620]  I mentioned this.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.441]  It's a really good report.
[01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:11.622]  It's at Infowars.com.
[01:00:11.622 --> 01:00:13.964]  I'm going to play just like four or five minutes of it here.
[01:00:13.964 --> 01:00:23.511]  Then I'm going to come back in a longer segment and start drilling into the really big news of Trump and the announcement he's made that Biden will soon be gone from office.
[01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:24.212]  Wow.
[01:00:24.212 --> 01:00:24.953]  That's a big deal.
[01:00:24.953 --> 01:00:28.336]  So we'll cover that here in just a moment.
[01:00:28.336 --> 01:00:33.560]  But here is again what Ted Cruz had to say that is absolutely on target.
[01:00:34.873 --> 01:00:37.576]  And first this morning, the Fauci Facebook censorship.
[01:00:37.576 --> 01:00:45.523]  We now know that Dr. Anthony Fauci misled or flat-out lied under oath to Senator Rand Paul during a Senate committee hearing.
[01:00:45.523 --> 01:00:57.153]  But today we are learning more about his potential collusion with the social media giant Facebook to keep that lie going and censor very serious information about the origins of COVID-19.
[01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:00.356]  First, here's the Fauci flip-flop over a two-week period.
[01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:00.616]  Watch.
[01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:20.081]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain-of-function research and if it is it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina and if you look at the grant and you look at the progress reports it is not gain-of-function despite the fact
[01:01:20.621 --> 01:01:22.262]  That people tweet that?
[01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:26.963]  It would have been almost a dereliction of our duty if we didn't study this.
[01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:31.525]  And the only way you can study these things is you've got to go where the action is.
[01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:40.468]  So we had a modest collaboration with very respectable Chinese scientists who are world experts on coronavirus.
[01:01:40.468 --> 01:01:44.709]  And we did that through a sub-grant from a larger grant to EcoHealth.
[01:01:47.981 --> 01:01:49.182]  Ah, okay.
[01:01:49.182 --> 01:01:52.145]  Joining me right now to discuss this is Senator Ted Cruz.
[01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:55.208]  He sits on the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees.
[01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:56.650]  Senator, good morning to you.
[01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.311]  It is wonderful to see you this morning.
[01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.614]  I want to get right into the Facebook connection.
[01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:03.617]  But first, Senator, tell us, did Fauci commit perjury just there?
[01:02:06.162 --> 01:02:07.183]  It sure looks like it.
[01:02:07.183 --> 01:02:10.786]  He looked at Rand Paul's eyes and told a flat-out falsehood.
[01:02:10.786 --> 01:02:18.232]  And unfortunately, this has been a pattern with Dr. Fauci, that what he says on Monday somehow isn't the same as what he says on Tuesday.
[01:02:18.232 --> 01:02:21.495]  But don't worry, what he says on Wednesday is almost certain to be different.
[01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:27.899]  And I gotta say, this email dump that came out makes clear that this is not just being sloppy.
[01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:33.862]  It is systematic, and it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people.
[01:02:33.862 --> 01:02:38.265]  And as you noted, he wasn't doing it alone, but he was doing it with much of the U.S.
[01:02:38.265 --> 01:02:41.507]  government behind him, and with Facebook and big tech.
[01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:44.569]  Operating as an extension of the U.S.
[01:02:44.569 --> 01:03:01.057]  government, in order to silence any views that disagreed, not with the science, because he wasn't looking for the science, he was suppressing the science, but rather trying to silence anything that disagreed with the political narrative that was convenient that he was pushing at that moment.
[01:03:02.728 --> 01:03:08.416]  Are you going to be able to do anything as a sitting senator on these so important committees?
[01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.939]  I mean, look, Senator, this keeps happening.
[01:03:10.939 --> 01:03:16.988]  First it was the Russia hoax that the media said was not true and they banned posts about it.
[01:03:16.988 --> 01:03:19.271]  Then it was a fake impeachment trial.
[01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:23.372]  Then it was the COVID treatment, hydroxychloroquine.
[01:03:23.372 --> 01:03:24.913]  We couldn't talk about that.
[01:03:24.913 --> 01:03:29.074]  Then it was the origins of COVID, that they have egg on their face.
[01:03:29.074 --> 01:03:32.415]  We're also not allowed to talk about election 2020.
[01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:36.577]  Look at this timeline about the Facebook Fauci censorship.
[01:03:37.237 --> 01:03:43.559]  On March 15th, Zuckerberg emails Fauci suggesting that they partner on COVID-19 Information Hub.
[01:03:43.559 --> 01:03:48.240]  And then on April 16th, 2020, Facebook posts steps that it is taking.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:55.502]  It changes its policy, quote, to combat COVID-19 related misinformation, it claims.
[01:03:55.502 --> 01:04:03.305]  February 8th, 2021, Facebook announces it will be removing more false claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.
[01:04:03.305 --> 01:04:03.645]  May 25th,
[01:04:04.785 --> 01:04:17.393]  Fauci admits to modest collaboration, as we just heard, and then on May 26th, suddenly Facebook has to change its policy again, saying it will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is mad made.
[01:04:17.393 --> 01:04:19.394]  I mean, what's going on here?
[01:04:19.394 --> 01:04:26.498]  Will these companies ever be held to account for this corporate dominance and misleading of information to the American people?
[01:04:28.544 --> 01:04:30.065]  Well, they certainly should be.
[01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:35.368]  Unfortunately, I don't expect the Biden administration will do anything to hold them to account.
[01:04:35.368 --> 01:04:38.309]  But these latest breakthroughs have real consequence.
[01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:46.873]  Because it now is clear that Facebook was operating at the direction of and in the direct benefit of the federal government.
[01:04:46.873 --> 01:04:48.874]  And that's completely illegal, folks.
[01:04:48.874 --> 01:04:50.595]  That's not just uncivil.
[01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:54.217]  That's a government censorship program through a corporation.
[01:04:54.217 --> 01:04:55.458]  And so they're fencing it.
[01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:56.979]  They're laundering the censorship through them.
[01:04:58.968 --> 01:05:11.753]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[01:05:11.753 --> 01:05:12.733]  history.
[01:05:12.733 --> 01:05:17.335]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[01:05:17.335 --> 01:05:19.496]  America is under globalist takeover.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.281]  It's an information war.
[01:05:21.281 --> 01:05:22.341]  It is an economic war.
[01:05:22.341 --> 01:05:25.903]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[01:05:25.903 --> 01:05:31.265]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:33.626]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:36.447]  We were the first to tell you the vaccine passports were coming.
[01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:37.388]  We were the first to lay out
[01:05:38.146 --> 01:05:41.947]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[01:05:41.947 --> 01:05:45.028]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever.
[01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:49.129]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:05:49.129 --> 01:05:53.690]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polym Blok.
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:06:00.012]  So, to all the veterans and all the Patriots, we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[01:06:00.012 --> 01:06:05.053]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:15.061]  Okay, thank you for joining us on this Sunday, June 6th transmission.
[01:06:15.061 --> 01:06:17.461]  We are into hour number two right now.
[01:06:17.461 --> 01:06:22.842]  Let's dig into our top story that I mentioned at the beginning, but I want to drill into right now.
[01:06:22.842 --> 01:06:24.843]  President Trump, he won the election in a landslide.
[01:06:24.843 --> 01:06:25.503]  We all know that.
[01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:27.063]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:06:27.063 --> 01:06:30.023]  When they closed the polls, he was winning in battleground states.
[01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:38.745]  Then he won by just a few thousand votes last time, by multiple percentage points, hundreds of thousands, some states millions of more votes.
[01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:39.325]  Just incredible.
[01:06:40.245 --> 01:06:41.046]  We know that happened.
[01:06:41.046 --> 01:06:42.247]  They gas lit us.
[01:06:42.247 --> 01:06:47.912]  They said, you're not supposed to question us when we say that Trump lost.
[01:06:47.912 --> 01:06:54.357]  Even though Democrats are always saying, hey, we're going to question, you know, elections, we're allowed to do that, but you're not.
[01:06:54.357 --> 01:07:07.428]  And then Big Tech came in and censored and blocked and managed things, and even censored congressmen, even censored the president, took away his Facebook, his Twitter, silenced him so that he couldn't challenge them.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:18.184]  And they provocateured the January 6th event to then demonize the idea of protest as some type of criminal insurrection.
[01:07:18.184 --> 01:07:28.787]  Now, Trump has come out this weekend and put out a statement on Friday, then he put out videos that were basically from the statement on Saturday.
[01:07:28.787 --> 01:07:33.449]  We're going to play some of those clips now, but the first big one he says that
[01:07:35.057 --> 01:07:42.522]  The Republicans are stronger than ever and we're going to get more House members and more Senate members and we're going to take back the White House sooner than you would think.
[01:07:42.522 --> 01:07:49.406]  Well, there's not another election for three and a half years.
[01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:50.126]  So what does that mean?
[01:07:50.126 --> 01:07:53.268]  It means clearly election fraud evidence is coming out.
[01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:54.569]  It's being documented.
[01:07:54.569 --> 01:07:55.590]  The states are getting together.
[01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:56.570]  They're organizing it.
[01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.611]  They're figuring it out.
[01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:59.432]  The Democrats are trying to pass H.R.
[01:07:59.432 --> 01:08:02.154]  1 that legalizes the fraud.
[01:08:02.154 --> 01:08:03.374]  It federalizes elections.
[01:08:03.374 --> 01:08:04.175]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:08:05.979 --> 01:08:07.840]  So it's very obvious what's going on.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.082]  So to have him announce this, some people are like, oh, he's all a blowhard.
[01:08:12.082 --> 01:08:12.482]  Oh, really?
[01:08:12.482 --> 01:08:13.743]  He never ran for office?
[01:08:13.743 --> 01:08:16.064]  Ran once and won.
[01:08:16.064 --> 01:08:28.250]  They're telling him that if he doesn't back down and stop talking about running and stop controlling the Republican Party and getting good people elected, which he is doing, all over the country, he's getting great people elected.
[01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:32.072]  If he doesn't back down, they're going to indict Giuliani, Trump Jr., and then him.
[01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:52.610]  George Soros' minion, Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, and they've got the New York City prosecutor, all of them saying they're going to indict Trump as a shot against the bow, a shot across the bow, and Trump is coming out and saying, I don't care.
[01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:55.173]  In fact, you're a fraud and you're going to be out of office soon.
[01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:57.970]  Wow, what an amazing statement.
[01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:02.153]  So, I give it to Trump to not back down in the face of attacks.
[01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:04.235]  And it's easy to say he should have done this, he should have done that.
[01:09:04.235 --> 01:09:06.917]  You know what it's like to be the man in the arena?
[01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:07.698]  I've been in the arena.
[01:09:07.698 --> 01:09:11.001]  Most of you out there have been in the arena your whole life, at one time or another.
[01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:13.383]  Some people, I guess, have never tried to be in the arena.
[01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.105]  But even if you try to stay out of it, you're still in it.
[01:09:16.105 --> 01:09:18.207]  So you might as well do the best you can.
[01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:22.591]  But I've been very critical of Trump, not doing more rallies.
[01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.952]  He's starting them now.
[01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:25.173]  I've been very critical of Trump.
[01:09:25.985 --> 01:09:28.887]  Uh, not coming out against the vaccine, but he's committed to it.
[01:09:28.887 --> 01:09:30.227]  He, he believes in it.
[01:09:30.227 --> 01:09:31.968]  You know, he took it himself.
[01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:36.370]  It's this tough guy attitude that, oh, it's not that bad because he likes the doctors around him.
[01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:38.691]  He believes in science, but this isn't science.
[01:09:38.691 --> 01:09:40.572]  This is eugenics.
[01:09:40.572 --> 01:09:52.758]  And, and so that's a big blind spot, but I can forgive Trump that because he's getting good Republicans elected that are pro-gun, pro-life, pro-family, pro-America existing, pro-border security.
[01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:56.593]  And that's why the globalists hate his guts.
[01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.674]  So, hey, he's not in there anymore.
[01:09:58.674 --> 01:09:59.654]  Don't have him to blame.
[01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:00.955]  Don't have him to kick around.
[01:10:00.955 --> 01:10:03.276]  It's all about Joe Biden.
[01:10:03.276 --> 01:10:11.119]  And Trump, despite all the demonization and all the attacks, is now coming out and really throwing down the gauntlet in a big, big way.
[01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:19.322]  And so he deserves our support now, I think, more than ever, because if we don't take control of that Senate and if we don't take control of that House,
[01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:30.709]  And if we let their election fraud be cemented, we're going to live under a permanent, leftist, satanic, pedophile, transhumanist regime.
[01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:32.710]  But that's a side issue.
[01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:36.653]  Regardless, we have to take action and not just hope Trump does the right thing.
[01:10:36.653 --> 01:10:38.494]  But this is still a big deal.
[01:10:38.494 --> 01:10:39.915]  And I'm going to open the phones up tomorrow.
[01:10:39.915 --> 01:10:41.757]  I'm sure Owen, he loves to take calls.
[01:10:41.757 --> 01:10:46.540]  He'll probably be taking calls tonight, 6 to 8, right after I'm off on this subject.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.661]  I've told Owen to do it.
[01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:48.661]  I've told Owen what to do.
[01:10:49.855 --> 01:10:55.484]  To make a wild guess that he'll open the phones up on this Trump subject, because I just thought I should have.
[01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.907]  I should, but I've got too much news to get to.
[01:10:57.907 --> 01:11:03.976]  So, let's go ahead and go to Trump and his extremely cryptic statement.
[01:11:03.976 --> 01:11:04.277]  Here it is.
[01:11:05.618 --> 01:11:09.280]  I want to thank everybody for the tremendous support you've shown.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.741]  We're going to take back the Senate, take back the House.
[01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:13.442]  We're going to take back the White House.
[01:11:13.442 --> 01:11:17.784]  And sooner than you think, it's going to be really something special.
[01:11:17.784 --> 01:11:24.767]  But the love and the affection and the respect that you've given all of us, it's really important.
[01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:31.551]  The Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been, and it's going to be a lot stronger than it is right now.
[01:11:31.551 --> 01:11:32.651]  We're going to turn it around.
[01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:34.052]  We're going to turn it around fast.
[01:11:34.468 --> 01:11:35.829]  Thank you all very much.
[01:11:35.829 --> 01:11:38.330]  That support has been so incredible.
[01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:40.451]  Thank you.
[01:11:40.451 --> 01:11:47.796]  And then he went on in another statement this weekend to attack the fact that Biden doesn't know who he is and who the hell is running things.
[01:11:47.796 --> 01:11:52.979]  So he's definitely going on the offense against the people that control Biden.
[01:11:52.979 --> 01:11:55.720]  That's Obama and the globalists and Soros.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.341]  And so this is a very bold move.
[01:11:57.341 --> 01:11:59.783]  I mean, this is this is death defying.
[01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.144]  Believe me, here it is.
[01:12:02.144 --> 01:12:03.825]  If you don't have election integrity,
[01:12:04.562 --> 01:12:10.765]  And if you don't have strong borders, our country can be run like a dictatorship, and that's what they'd like to do.
[01:12:10.765 --> 01:12:13.146]  I don't even think Biden is the dictator.
[01:12:13.146 --> 01:12:16.688]  If anybody knows who the hell is running that operation, could you let us know?
[01:12:16.688 --> 01:12:18.909]  Because I don't think it's Joe, but who the hell knows?
[01:12:18.909 --> 01:12:20.970]  Maybe it is.
[01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:28.734]  The current president of the U.S., in exile, relegated to right-side broadcasting with a huge hum on the feed.
[01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:31.136]  And by the way, I'm not putting right-side broadcasting down.
[01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:31.996]  They're great people.
[01:12:31.996 --> 01:12:33.577]  But that's how ragtag we are.
[01:12:34.449 --> 01:12:44.116]  Trump is in blurry video shot in a ballroom about how Biden will be gone soon, and then he's on a humming video giving a speech, you know, to it.
[01:12:44.116 --> 01:12:47.558]  I mean, and I'll tell you why that is.
[01:12:47.558 --> 01:13:00.127]  Anyone with any skills and any money that tries to support him, the media comes after you, the FBI comes after you, they take your bank accounts away.
[01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:06.064]  They did all this to us, and thanks to you, and thanks to a lot of work, we stayed on air and got around it all for now.
[01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:09.046]  But, I mean, this is like nip and tuck, folks.
[01:13:09.046 --> 01:13:12.009]  This is so dangerous, this is so real.
[01:13:12.009 --> 01:13:22.918]  So, I can only admire Trump when he's up there, ragtag, swinging for the fences, with all the obstacles and all the cards stacked against him.
[01:13:22.918 --> 01:13:26.962]  But, at the end of the day, we're all in that position as well.
[01:13:28.283 --> 01:13:32.025]  But we have truth and we have justice and we have God on our side.
[01:13:32.025 --> 01:13:33.066]  And we don't have a choice.
[01:13:33.066 --> 01:13:35.507]  I mean, these globalists aren't going to stop.
[01:13:35.507 --> 01:13:36.127]  They're evil.
[01:13:36.127 --> 01:13:36.687]  They're twisted.
[01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:37.448]  They're mentally ill.
[01:13:37.448 --> 01:13:38.808]  They want everything.
[01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:47.033]  You want to go home and eat a nice dinner and hang out with your wife or husband and watch a TV show or maybe go play golf or maybe go for a swim or a hike or you want to play with your dogs or whatever?
[01:13:47.033 --> 01:13:49.294]  You know, you want to go show up.
[01:13:53.214 --> 01:13:54.375]  Piece of clothing together.
[01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:55.675]  I mean, people have their own.
[01:13:55.675 --> 01:13:57.256]  You want to build a Balsawood airplane?
[01:13:57.256 --> 01:13:58.877]  You want to go see a movie?
[01:13:58.877 --> 01:14:01.358]  The globalists want to run your life.
[01:14:01.358 --> 01:14:03.519]  They like ordering people around.
[01:14:03.519 --> 01:14:05.160]  They like dominating people.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.642]  They like controlling.
[01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:09.983]  That's another huge clip.
[01:14:09.983 --> 01:14:12.084]  We're going to come back now.
[01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:14.585]  And I'm looking at all these stacks of news.
[01:14:14.585 --> 01:14:15.285]  There's so much.
[01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:20.528]  And in the last three segments of this hour, I'm going to cover it all.
[01:14:21.983 --> 01:14:34.030]  And we've got the biggest news yet on how they're going to strike us, and how the Globalists plan to take over, and the next big fake crisis they've got up their sleeve.
[01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:37.051]  And then we're also going to hit the incredible news.
[01:14:37.051 --> 01:14:42.815]  In India, they're turning the power off to villages that won't inject everybody with the deadly shots.
[01:14:42.815 --> 01:14:46.677]  And West Point's putting people in solitary confinement that won't do it.
[01:14:46.677 --> 01:14:49.138]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:14:49.138 --> 01:14:50.779]  That is all coming up next segment.
[01:14:51.816 --> 01:14:54.999]  Separately, tonight is the last night.
[01:14:54.999 --> 01:14:57.041]  Tomorrow, it's gone.
[01:14:57.041 --> 01:15:09.053]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 40% off DNA Force+, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Metal Vitality.
[01:15:09.053 --> 01:15:09.774]  It's all there.
[01:15:09.774 --> 01:15:14.118]  Apollo Blocks back in stock, 40% off a natural antihistamine.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:15.781]  It's all there.
[01:15:15.781 --> 01:15:18.285]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:18.285 --> 01:15:19.387]  And this stuff works great.
[01:15:19.387 --> 01:15:20.649]  It's why people buy it.
[01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.390]  It's why they love it.
[01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.093]  It's why the globalists want it all banned.
[01:15:23.093 --> 01:15:26.759]  We have the double... fizzy...
[01:15:27.936 --> 01:15:29.176]  System as well.
[01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:34.337]  And if you don't know what that does for you, just go look into what magnesium does.
[01:15:34.337 --> 01:15:35.778]  Two types of magnesium.
[01:15:35.778 --> 01:15:36.938]  The other competitors don't have that.
[01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:37.998]  It's even better.
[01:15:37.998 --> 01:15:38.818]  And it tastes great.
[01:15:38.818 --> 01:15:41.119]  That's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.259]  40% off.
[01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:44.019]  In-game, Blue River Global Enslavement.
[01:15:44.019 --> 01:15:46.240]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.260]  Everything on the site.
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.900]  And it ends tomorrow morning when the new sale goes up.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.121]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:52.821]  Take action today.
[01:15:52.821 --> 01:15:53.341]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.223 --> 01:16:00.804]  I've been on air 27 years.
[01:16:00.804 --> 01:16:05.465]  And we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:09.026]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:16:09.026 --> 01:16:16.889]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[01:16:16.889 --> 01:16:20.590]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:26.972]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[01:16:27.752 --> 01:16:31.396]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[01:16:31.396 --> 01:16:34.159]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:38.764]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[01:16:38.764 --> 01:16:41.907]  And so InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[01:16:41.907 --> 01:16:44.910]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:47.272]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[01:16:47.272 --> 01:16:48.513]  It's so expensive.
[01:16:48.513 --> 01:16:53.799]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:53.799 --> 01:16:57.923]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-1 free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:16:57.923 --> 01:17:02.548]  I am very, very proud to be at the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:17:02.548 --> 01:17:03.529]  But I can't stay.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:09.462]  At the tip of the spear, fighting for my family and your family unless you support us.
[01:17:09.462 --> 01:17:15.604]  And you do that by praying for us, by spreading the word with our articles and videos, and by financially supporting us.
[01:17:15.604 --> 01:17:19.065]  And that's really important to do because we don't have Bill Gates.
[01:17:19.065 --> 01:17:20.566]  We don't have Warren Buffett.
[01:17:20.566 --> 01:17:21.706]  We don't have Ted Turner.
[01:17:21.706 --> 01:17:23.467]  We don't have George Soros funding us.
[01:17:23.467 --> 01:17:25.388]  We have the people funding us.
[01:17:25.388 --> 01:17:27.549]  And right now, it's really easy to do.
[01:17:27.549 --> 01:17:28.409]  Biggest sale of the year.

[01:17:55.488 --> 01:17:56.569]  Free shipping ends Monday.

[01:18:58.536 --> 01:19:00.077]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[01:19:00.077 --> 01:19:00.837]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:01.598]  Try to move quicker.
[01:19:01.598 --> 01:19:02.418]  Hey, Alex.
[01:19:02.418 --> 01:19:02.858]  Welcome.
[01:19:02.858 --> 01:19:08.001]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[01:19:08.001 --> 01:19:11.383]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[01:19:11.383 --> 01:19:17.846]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[01:19:17.846 --> 01:19:19.507]  Living Defense saved my life.
[01:19:19.507 --> 01:19:23.669]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:25.110]  Living Defense brought me back.
[01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:30.913]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[01:19:30.913 --> 01:19:33.314]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:42.619]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[01:19:42.619 --> 01:19:48.041]  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[01:19:48.041 --> 01:19:49.462]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[01:19:49.782 --> 01:19:55.526]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[01:19:55.526 --> 01:20:01.591]  Because God created this country.
[01:20:01.591 --> 01:20:04.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.759 --> 01:20:20.881]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:21.862]  Big Brother.
[01:20:21.862 --> 01:20:23.645]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:23.645 --> 01:20:25.548]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:25.548 --> 01:20:27.230]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:28.893]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:28.893 --> 01:20:33.440]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:56.991]  Welcome to the Live Sunday Broadcast.
[01:20:56.991 --> 01:21:07.276]  This is a simulcast of my radio show via television over the internet and on stations across this country.
[01:21:07.276 --> 01:21:09.938]  Alright, let's get to this for TV viewers.
[01:21:09.938 --> 01:21:10.458]  You can see it.
[01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:11.819]  I'm going to find out who this artist is.
[01:21:12.538 --> 01:21:15.339]  Maybe even put a t-shirt out, because this needs to be seen.
[01:21:15.339 --> 01:21:33.786]  And it's the image of a looming devil, a big blue devil, with the blue fires of hell, with a young mother, with her little baby toddler, hiding behind her, looking at Satan, who wants to inject his Bill Gates juice into them.
[01:21:33.786 --> 01:21:37.548]  This is a real form of genetic overwrite.
[01:21:38.966 --> 01:21:46.890]  When a man rapes a woman and gets her pregnant, he's forcibly, genetically creating a cross-clone with her.
[01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:51.011]  A splice.
[01:21:51.011 --> 01:21:51.752]  And that's what this is.
[01:21:51.752 --> 01:21:52.652]  This is rape.
[01:21:52.652 --> 01:21:55.533]  Whatever happened to my body, my choice?
[01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:56.714]  This is their big revolution.
[01:21:56.714 --> 01:21:57.974]  This is their big move.
[01:21:57.974 --> 01:21:59.295]  They had to do it at some point.
[01:21:59.295 --> 01:22:00.496]  They want to depopulate us.
[01:22:00.496 --> 01:22:02.036]  They keep telling us that's what they're doing.
[01:22:02.036 --> 01:22:04.837]  And now it's here!
[01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:05.878]  Very powerful image.
[01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:09.544]  But now, let's get to this.
[01:22:09.544 --> 01:22:11.825]  Village refuses COVID vaccine.
[01:22:11.825 --> 01:22:17.368]  Power supply cut off, says the Indian Telegraph, one of the biggest papers in India.
[01:22:17.368 --> 01:22:23.530]  And they're just reporting this in a very matter-of-fact way.
[01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:27.792]  So, they came to the village and they tried to forcibly inject people.
[01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:34.976]  So the men got together and beat them up and hit them on the head with sticks.
[01:22:34.976 --> 01:22:35.396]  And so,
[01:22:36.778 --> 01:22:43.382]  The government's paid to do this, and so they left.
[01:22:43.382 --> 01:22:47.885]  So the answer now is to turn their power off.
[01:22:47.885 --> 01:22:53.008]  Kind of like Texas didn't behave the way it was supposed to, so Biden turned our power off during the ice storm.
[01:22:53.008 --> 01:22:57.750]  By the way, Texas sent a letter and said, hey, we need to up the power at these coal plants.
[01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:00.892]  We can be put in jail if we don't get authorization or fined.
[01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:02.013]  And they said, you may not.
[01:23:03.337 --> 01:23:06.279]  Until the power went out, then they allowed the power to be turned up.
[01:23:06.279 --> 01:23:08.561]  And it's a fact they did that.
[01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:11.323]  But then it becomes some debate.
[01:23:11.323 --> 01:23:17.949]  Like when I say there's human animal clones, humanoids are being grown inside cows across the U.S.
[01:23:17.949 --> 01:23:22.312]  I told you that 20 plus years ago, and there was an MIT headline like three years ago.
[01:23:22.312 --> 01:23:29.478]  Humanoids are gestating inside cows at facilities across the U.S.
[01:23:29.478 --> 01:23:30.419]  They just throw it in your face.
[01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:35.679]  See how that works?
[01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:36.479]  It's just crazy.
[01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.580]  So they don't want us to form opposition ahead of it.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.201]  So we say, we're not for that.
[01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:44.063]  They go, hey, we're human animal cloning now, not a damn thing you can do about it.
[01:23:44.063 --> 01:23:52.528]  And just hope, and by the way, we're going to send convicted pedophiles over to your house.
[01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:53.749]  First, it's your school.
[01:23:53.749 --> 01:23:58.511]  You're going to let them have a little talk with your child about their sexuality.
[01:23:58.511 --> 01:24:01.333]  By the way, USA Today's put out a front page story
[01:24:02.964 --> 01:24:03.564]  We're good to go.
[01:24:21.471 --> 01:24:22.031]  Here's another one.
[01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:24.552]  Vaccine scandal rocks West Point.
[01:24:24.552 --> 01:24:37.175]  Cadets are being threatened with solitary confinement, separation from the academy, essential training is being refused, and they are facing daily direct pressure from senior officers at the institution that they do not take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:24:37.175 --> 01:24:39.556]  That violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:24:39.556 --> 01:24:45.237]  It's not even mandatory in the military because you can't make them take an experimental shot.
[01:24:45.237 --> 01:24:47.218]  Outrageous criminal activity.
[01:24:50.226 --> 01:24:56.988]  India opposes discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine passports at G7 meeting.
[01:24:56.988 --> 01:25:01.010]  But France, the UK, and the US want it.
[01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:09.092]  While telling you on the news that no one will ever make you take it, then Bloomberg's like, we need to make everyone take it.
[01:25:09.092 --> 01:25:12.093]  They have a separate article, no one wants you to take it, don't listen to them.
[01:25:12.093 --> 01:25:16.515]  So we don't form opposition, like, hey, we don't like Antifa killing people, they don't exist.
[01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:18.168]  Next day.
[01:25:18.168 --> 01:25:18.849]  They're heroes.
[01:25:18.849 --> 01:25:19.689]  Antifa's heroes.
[01:25:19.689 --> 01:25:20.289]  They don't exist.
[01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:21.610]  Same TV program.
[01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:23.411]  Gaslighting.
[01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:24.932]  And the same thing here.
[01:25:24.932 --> 01:25:25.993]  Oh, we're gonna make you take it.
[01:25:25.993 --> 01:25:26.853]  Well, I don't want to.
[01:25:26.853 --> 01:25:27.393]  You're crazy.
[01:25:27.393 --> 01:25:31.155]  No one wants to make you take it.
[01:25:31.155 --> 01:25:33.477]  India opposes discriminatory COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:25:33.477 --> 01:25:34.357]  Passport.
[01:25:34.357 --> 01:25:35.658]  No trust.
[01:25:35.658 --> 01:25:41.721]  Top Republican Kevin McCarthy calls for Fauci's resignation amid COVID-19 email leak.
[01:25:41.721 --> 01:25:44.783]  But Raggedy Ann
[01:25:46.929 --> 01:25:53.074]  AKA Saki comes out and says, oh no, we don't want to do that.
[01:25:53.074 --> 01:25:57.658]  He's the most wonderful person in the world.
[01:25:57.658 --> 01:26:02.541]  Trump says China must pay reparations for unleashing the Corona pandemic.
[01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:10.508]  Fauci's NIH funded Wuhan military scientist who died mysteriously after filing COVID vaccine patent.
[01:26:10.508 --> 01:26:10.568]  Oh,
[01:26:11.656 --> 01:26:24.865]  Yes, because they'd already actually created the patent under another name before, and of course, so that was such a big deal to have that, that the front man that was involved in it had to die, because dead men tell no tales.
[01:26:24.865 --> 01:26:26.647]  There's been a lot of deaths at the lab.
[01:26:26.647 --> 01:26:34.532]  A lot of people died of COVID before it was even announced to be released, but they didn't really die of COVID, they died from being poisoned.
[01:26:34.532 --> 01:26:39.936]  But now they're out of the way, because we belonged.
[01:26:41.812 --> 01:26:44.934]  Bill Gates now.
[01:26:44.934 --> 01:26:58.662]  And here she is, raggedy Ann, breaking Saki Defense's renowned public servant, Anthony Fauci, says no way Biden will ever fire him because they don't want that first domino to fall.
[01:26:59.733 --> 01:27:01.194]  Here's another big article from Gateway Pundit.
[01:27:01.194 --> 01:27:12.541]  The individual behind Obama's 2017 memo reauthorizing funding for gain-of-function R&D were the same individuals who lied and claimed COVID wasn't created in the lab.
[01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:16.324]  And guess who the main guy is on the board of all the groups?
[01:27:16.324 --> 01:27:20.386]  Anthony Fauci!
[01:27:20.386 --> 01:27:25.249]  And it goes through all of the grants and all the funding specifically for gain-of-function right there.
[01:27:25.249 --> 01:27:27.711]  Anthony Fauci's name is on all of it.
[01:27:27.711 --> 01:27:28.972]  They did it through the Pentagon.
[01:27:30.205 --> 01:27:30.625]  The U.S.
[01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:36.488]  Defense Department, and then Trump killed the program.
[01:27:36.488 --> 01:27:37.568]  So that's a good thing for Trump.
[01:27:37.568 --> 01:27:40.389]  I'm surprised he even knew about it.
[01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:44.951]  And so the answer is, oh, the Defense Department wanted to know what might be developed in the future.
[01:27:44.951 --> 01:27:48.252]  Oh, so you go create the weapon to know what somebody else might magically make.
[01:27:48.252 --> 01:27:48.933]  Yeah, right.
[01:27:48.933 --> 01:27:50.293]  That's for plausible deniability.
[01:27:50.293 --> 01:27:52.774]  When you say the Defense Department, you think about the military.
[01:27:52.774 --> 01:27:55.015]  It's not the military running it, it's the globalists.
[01:27:55.015 --> 01:27:56.896]  People like Robert McNamara and people like Fauci.
[01:27:57.628 --> 01:27:58.688]  Look at this one.
[01:27:58.688 --> 01:28:23.336]  Indian Bar Association serves legal notice upon Dr. Soumya Swamathian, the Chief Scientist of WHO, who tells people that you can't give folks remdesivir, even though it's like 100% effective, and so when they say that, then the medical systems of the world follow you in orders and won't let you have it and kill people, and so they're suing her to get her to stop it.
[01:28:23.336 --> 01:28:25.156]  See, that's how evil these people are.
[01:28:25.156 --> 01:28:27.237]  It's like, water does not cure thirst.
[01:28:28.018 --> 01:28:28.578]  No one.
[01:28:28.578 --> 01:28:31.179]  The UN says you do not need water in the desert.
[01:28:31.179 --> 01:28:33.500]  The UN says humans no longer need oxygen.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.561]  Humans need oxygen.
[01:28:34.561 --> 01:28:35.321]  Ban Alex Jones.
[01:28:35.321 --> 01:28:37.502]  The UN did not say we need oxygen.
[01:28:37.502 --> 01:28:38.822]  Well, but we do.
[01:28:38.822 --> 01:28:40.103]  You're not the UN, are you?
[01:28:40.103 --> 01:28:42.404]  I mean, the UN, baby!
[01:28:42.404 --> 01:28:44.204]  It's in charge of all information!
[01:28:44.204 --> 01:28:46.305]  You know, global government!
[01:28:46.305 --> 01:28:48.346]  Whoo!
[01:28:48.346 --> 01:28:51.567]  And a lot more on this coming up.
[01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:52.488]  And some good news.
[01:28:52.488 --> 01:28:55.949]  Federal judge overturns California's unconstitutional ban on assault weapons.
[01:29:00.057 --> 01:29:03.461]  What are champions made of?
[01:29:03.461 --> 01:29:04.583]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:29:11.159 --> 01:29:12.680]  AAA2533139, AAA2533139, AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.301]  AAA2533139, AAA2533139, AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:14.301 --> 01:29:15.741]  AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:15.741 --> 01:29:17.242]  AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:17.242 --> 01:29:18.383]  AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:18.383 --> 01:29:20.023]  AAA2533139 is the Infowars store hotline!
[01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:21.104]  Infowarsstore.com is simply
[01:29:39.813 --> 01:29:41.594]  That's InfoWarsStore.com
[01:29:58.695 --> 01:30:07.322]  Memorial Day 2021 is here, and that means store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points at InfowarStore.com.
[01:30:07.322 --> 01:30:15.829]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[01:30:15.829 --> 01:30:22.454]  And that's a good thing, because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:27.157]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[01:30:27.157 --> 01:30:29.999]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:31.961]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[01:30:31.961 --> 01:30:33.862]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[01:30:33.862 --> 01:30:35.003]  The list goes on and on.
[01:30:35.003 --> 01:30:40.587]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:30:40.587 --> 01:30:42.249]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[01:30:42.249 --> 01:30:43.850]  What else is back in stock?
[01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:45.571]  People are very excited to hear.
[01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:46.312]  Pollen Block.
[01:30:46.752 --> 01:30:54.796]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best selling products have been sold out for 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 7 months, it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[01:31:07.721 --> 01:31:09.423]  Really, genuinely freaked out.
[01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:14.507]  Because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation.
[01:31:14.507 --> 01:31:16.709]  Because they're great products and we're coming back and getting more.
[01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:18.130]  And thank you for the support.
[01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:24.095]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus, or whether it's Pollen Block, or whether it's Super Bowl Vitality, or Vazo Beats,
[01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:32.043]  Because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them.
[01:31:32.043 --> 01:31:40.148]  But thank God, it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now, because suddenly a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[01:31:40.148 --> 01:31:41.909]  And one of them is pollen block.
[01:31:41.909 --> 01:31:44.231]  It takes a long time to get into pollen block.
[01:31:44.853 --> 01:31:47.578]  But it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies.
[01:31:47.578 --> 01:31:49.141]  It's from France.
[01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:51.105]  It's a special proprietary system.
[01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:54.772]  This is the highest quality, back-of-the-stock, in-full-workstore.com.
[01:31:54.772 --> 01:31:57.096]  Storewide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:31:57.096 --> 01:31:57.477]  Check it out!
[01:31:58.593 --> 01:32:01.736]  This is a breaking Friday news alert.
[01:32:01.736 --> 01:32:04.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is in deep trouble.
[01:32:04.879 --> 01:32:10.364]  Their entire program of launching COVID-19 to launch the Great Reset is coming out.
[01:32:10.364 --> 01:32:15.408]  But they are launching massive hack attacks against infrastructure around the world to divert us.
[01:32:15.408 --> 01:32:18.531]  They're also trying to start a major race war to divert us.
[01:32:18.531 --> 01:32:24.677]  And Joe Biden's running around claiming that he cured COVID-19 because of the vaccine, the fact we wore masks.
[01:32:24.677 --> 01:32:24.817]  No.
[01:32:25.437 --> 01:32:31.104]  All they did was lower, as soon as he got into office, the PCR test from 40 cycles down to 29 or 28.
[01:32:31.104 --> 01:32:35.750]  If you lowered it down to 29 or 28, almost everyone is false negative.
[01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:38.713]  You raise it to 40, almost everyone is false positive.
[01:32:38.713 --> 01:32:42.738]  This is all a scam that makes Enron look like child's play.
[01:32:43.378 --> 01:32:48.281]  Only by exposing these criminals will we stop the worldwide lockdowns and stop future lockdowns.
[01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:50.102]  That's why it's us or them.
[01:32:50.102 --> 01:32:54.244]  The globalists either get exposed and go to prison, or the Great Reset wins and we're all dead.
[01:32:54.244 --> 01:32:55.065]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:55.065 --> 01:33:01.168]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:33:01.168 --> 01:33:03.750]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.533 --> 01:33:34.802]  But I read it in your letter You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing Two, three, four Oh, I'll pick you up If you come back to America
[01:33:36.574 --> 01:33:39.055]  We're back.
[01:33:39.055 --> 01:33:51.217]  You know, I was just telling that boom operator, John, about the time I got invited to the Hellfire Club in England to go to a Eyes Wide Shut type ritual.
[01:33:51.217 --> 01:33:53.358]  Yep.
[01:33:53.358 --> 01:33:58.119]  And I was told it was in confidence, and I'm not going to say who invited me, but it's a well-known person.
[01:34:00.891 --> 01:34:03.753]  And, and they, first I got a letter from Oxford.
[01:34:03.753 --> 01:34:05.375]  They wanted me to come speak at the Oxford Conference.
[01:34:05.375 --> 01:34:08.397]  And it was probably, whoever sent that letter, it was the Dean's office.
[01:34:08.397 --> 01:34:09.778]  They wanted me to go speak there.
[01:34:09.778 --> 01:34:11.440]  This was like 10 years ago.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.021]  Eight, nine years ago.
[01:34:13.021 --> 01:34:17.104]  Um, then I got contacted by the big Hollywood guy.
[01:34:17.104 --> 01:34:19.426]  And he's like, yeah, I heard you got invited to that.
[01:34:19.426 --> 01:34:20.827]  He said, you know what that really is?
[01:34:20.827 --> 01:34:22.649]  I said, let me guess.
[01:34:22.649 --> 01:34:24.430]  And he said, well, you'll have a lot of fun.
[01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:29.314]  They've got caves.
[01:34:29.314 --> 01:34:30.395]  I guess under Oxford.
[01:34:31.405 --> 01:34:33.767]  And that's where the original Hellfire Club is, and that's come out.
[01:34:33.767 --> 01:34:36.189]  Benjamin Franklin was involved as well.
[01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:43.474]  And it's basically the introductory level of showing that you don't have a lot of inhibition.
[01:34:43.474 --> 01:34:48.018]  It's basically like a strip club in the cave where you have sex with the women.
[01:34:48.018 --> 01:34:51.180]  And that's kind of the introductory level to Satanism.
[01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:52.261]  And that's where all that stuff goes.
[01:34:52.261 --> 01:34:57.965]  And the reason I was telling John about it is Boris Johnson's wife is admittedly a witch.
[01:34:57.965 --> 01:35:00.107]  So was Tony Blair's wife.
[01:35:01.067 --> 01:35:06.852]  And I knew she was a witch, but he was telling me it's in the news that they've leaked photos of her pentagrams doing satanic rituals.
[01:35:06.852 --> 01:35:10.195]  So, I mean, folks, you just do not... Yeah, there it is.
[01:35:10.195 --> 01:35:11.156]  Scroll through it.
[01:35:11.156 --> 01:35:15.139]  Boris Beach Blonde, X-rated.
[01:35:15.139 --> 01:35:17.942]  There they are.
[01:35:17.942 --> 01:35:24.548]  So, you don't get in the club... That's her in college doing a satanic ritual.
[01:35:24.548 --> 01:35:26.069]  You don't get in the club unless you're part of it.
[01:35:26.849 --> 01:35:34.353]  So it's not like, ooh, I'm cool, I got invited to, you know, the real, like, most people would kill to be in the real Hellfire Club.
[01:35:34.353 --> 01:35:36.033]  Like, oh great!
[01:35:36.033 --> 01:35:40.756]  I'll go to the same place Benjamin Franklin banged chicks and I'll have sex there.
[01:35:40.756 --> 01:35:41.776]  I'll be really cool.
[01:35:41.776 --> 01:35:43.637]  Yeah, no thank you.
[01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.038]  No thank you.
[01:35:45.038 --> 01:35:50.420]  I mean, I got sucked into that stuff without trying, repeatedly.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.021]  So I've been like in little subdivisions, you know.
[01:35:53.021 --> 01:35:54.542]  That was pretty wild.
[01:35:54.542 --> 01:35:56.043]  But no, that's like, and of course,
[01:35:57.156 --> 01:36:00.658]  Helmut Schmidt was German Chancellor, back when it was still East and West Germany.
[01:36:00.658 --> 01:36:02.679]  West German Chancellor.
[01:36:02.679 --> 01:36:07.181]  He wrote a book, Men in Power as a Political Retrospective.
[01:36:07.181 --> 01:36:08.642]  And what a weird name, too.
[01:36:08.642 --> 01:36:09.182]  Watch out.
[01:36:09.182 --> 01:36:11.903]  When you search into that name, like, gay porn comes up.
[01:36:11.903 --> 01:36:12.644]  For whatever reason.
[01:36:12.644 --> 01:36:17.586]  But the book's pre-internet, so it didn't get a wide circulation.
[01:36:17.586 --> 01:36:20.608]  But he says, I got a copy of it somewhere around the office.
[01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.509]  It's like four inches thick.
[01:36:22.509 --> 01:36:24.550]  Tex Mars gave me a copy of it.
[01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:26.771]  He admits the satanic rituals in Germany.
[01:36:27.603 --> 01:36:33.405]  And he says, but our favorite place to do them is the Bohemian Grove, which I did infiltrate.
[01:36:33.405 --> 01:36:36.626]  So, it's weird, man.
[01:36:36.626 --> 01:36:37.086]  It's weird.
[01:36:37.086 --> 01:36:38.526]  And that's all I'm trying to tell people.
[01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:42.027]  It's not like I'm just up here guessing all this stuff.
[01:36:42.027 --> 01:36:45.848]  It's not like I'm just up here like, oh, I think this is how it works.
[01:36:45.848 --> 01:36:48.269]  I think this is what's going on.
[01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:54.311]  All of you have had experiences in your life that God allowed you to have so that you would be part of a larger destiny.
[01:36:55.206 --> 01:37:01.751]  And so I'm not saying my life's been particularly cool compared to other people's, but it's been insane.
[01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:03.433]  And maybe you've had similar experiences.
[01:37:03.433 --> 01:37:05.734]  I don't think most of you probably have.
[01:37:05.734 --> 01:37:09.277]  Most times in my life, I was like, God, why are you doing this to me?
[01:37:09.277 --> 01:37:11.759]  This is not fun.
[01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:17.924]  And well, it's because there's other free will in the universe and there are some bad guys.
[01:37:17.924 --> 01:37:21.007]  I shot the footage you see right there, hidden camera.
[01:37:21.007 --> 01:37:21.187]  So
[01:37:23.047 --> 01:37:27.530]  I didn't mean to go off on that jag, but he was just talking about how bad Boris Johnson is.
[01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:29.311]  Oh, that's why we brought up Boris Johnson.
[01:37:29.311 --> 01:37:31.153]  This is how stuff works around here.
[01:37:31.153 --> 01:37:32.233]  Here's one.
[01:37:32.233 --> 01:37:33.775]  COVID-19 news.
[01:37:33.775 --> 01:37:42.321]  Boris Johnson to set end 2022 target to vaccinate the world at the G7.
[01:37:42.321 --> 01:37:48.385]  And you're like, wow, since when did the G7 group decide who's going to be vaccinated or not?
[01:37:48.385 --> 01:37:51.407]  Well, he said that when England took over,
[01:37:52.637 --> 01:38:02.983]  The G7 for the year 2021, in the rotating membership, that he would put Bill Gates in charge of the G7 medical response.
[01:38:02.983 --> 01:38:04.003]  You can pull that article up.
[01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:06.184]  So he said that six, seven months ago.
[01:38:06.184 --> 01:38:06.985]  Now he's the head of the G7.
[01:38:06.985 --> 01:38:09.846]  He's in the middle of the term and there it is.
[01:38:09.846 --> 01:38:13.328]  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets Bill Gates to discuss COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:38:13.328 --> 01:38:17.710]  And he goes on to say, I'm going to follow his orders on the G7.
[01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:20.772]  So when Boris Johnson isn't having a druidic wedding,
[01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:28.498]  And when he's not sitting there with his stupid wife, who thinks she gets power out of pentagrams, and I guess she does!
[01:38:28.498 --> 01:38:30.519]  She's like, oh, my husband's the Prime Minister!
[01:38:30.519 --> 01:38:37.725]  And look, I'm... Because the devil put you in there, you idiot!
[01:38:37.725 --> 01:38:39.586]  You don't have any real power!
[01:38:39.586 --> 01:38:41.928]  You're a puppet, like Nancy Pelosi!
[01:38:41.928 --> 01:38:42.929]  Have you looked at her?
[01:38:42.929 --> 01:38:46.011]  You think that's powerful?
[01:38:46.011 --> 01:38:48.754]  You think Hillary Clinton's got power?
[01:38:48.754 --> 01:38:49.214]  Real power?
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:53.726]  You think, uh, you think any of these devil worshippers have real power?
[01:38:53.726 --> 01:38:56.871]  Oh my gosh, you go in caves and have sex with women.
[01:38:56.871 --> 01:38:59.175]  That's so shocking, so risque.
[01:38:59.175 --> 01:39:01.598]  And then next it's you strangle a little kid.
[01:39:01.598 --> 01:39:01.919]  I get it.
[01:39:03.368 --> 01:39:07.551]  And then imagine how you feel when you're coming out of the cave and you just strangled some toddler you raped.
[01:39:07.551 --> 01:39:08.512]  Must feel real good.
[01:39:08.512 --> 01:39:15.098]  No, you feel scared and you feel empty and God removes his spirit from you and now you're wide open to Satan.
[01:39:15.098 --> 01:39:27.968]  Satan wants you to lower your defenses, do horrible things so that you are totally and completely turned over to it and are like these two disgusting jellyfish that you see on screen.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:38.527]  Disgusting jellyfish that are just placeholders for Satan.
[01:39:38.527 --> 01:39:43.632]  You know, Satan's setting up his feast and he's got all the tables set up and all the chairs set up for who's going to sit where.
[01:39:43.632 --> 01:39:48.256]  And these people are all just like a card on the table.
[01:39:48.256 --> 01:39:49.558]  They just hold the place.
[01:39:55.819 --> 01:40:01.502]  You know, we see articles like Boris Johnson's girlfriend, she's the reason he's going to turn out good.
[01:40:01.502 --> 01:40:02.842]  He'll, he'll, yeah.
[01:40:02.842 --> 01:40:09.986]  And so he came in, took over Brexit and is now wrecking it and heading up the G7 to sell us into world government.
[01:40:09.986 --> 01:40:12.407]  I mean, with his stupid fop hair.
[01:40:12.407 --> 01:40:14.348]  Oh, his hair flies around.
[01:40:14.348 --> 01:40:16.129]  He's like Einstein.
[01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:23.392]  I mean, I could blow dry my hair and I would stick up and ooh, look, my hair's hanging over my head like I'm a 14 year old meth addict.
[01:40:24.787 --> 01:40:26.749]  Sorry, I'm on a Boris Johnson rant right now.
[01:40:26.749 --> 01:40:28.331]  Does that even really matter?
[01:40:28.331 --> 01:40:29.572]  Look at him.
[01:40:29.572 --> 01:40:31.054]  He's like Igor.
[01:40:31.054 --> 01:40:31.955]  Yes, master.
[01:40:31.955 --> 01:40:33.616]  What can I do for you?
[01:40:33.616 --> 01:40:35.598]  Supply us more children.
[01:40:35.598 --> 01:40:36.559]  Yes, master.
[01:40:36.559 --> 01:40:39.983]  I will do it immediately.
[01:40:39.983 --> 01:40:42.726]  I guarantee you that guy's Jimmy Savile.
[01:40:42.726 --> 01:40:46.390]  I don't think that woman is even his wife.
[01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:47.451]  Okay, I'm just saying it.
[01:40:48.829 --> 01:40:49.850]  I'm just saying it.
[01:40:49.850 --> 01:41:02.320]  If I was casting a movie and I had to have, like, two ghouls that go kidnapping children for a vampire, that drive a weird, creepy van, and that climb in the windows at night and grab kids, because, you know, that really happens.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.280]  He isn't a pedophile.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.264]  He's the guy that kidnaps your child and delivers them to a pedophile.
[01:41:08.264 --> 01:41:10.526]  That's Boris Johnson, okay?
[01:41:10.526 --> 01:41:14.449]  He is a Renfield-type operative.
[01:41:14.449 --> 01:41:14.990]  Oh, boy.
[01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.312]  Oh, boy.
[01:41:18.678 --> 01:41:21.239]  Burn in hell, Boris Johnson.
[01:41:21.239 --> 01:41:30.643]  Burn in hell in your stupid Hellfire Club.
[01:41:30.643 --> 01:41:33.024]  You guys want to hear some Hellfire Club stories?
[01:41:33.024 --> 01:41:36.186]  Because, you know, everybody mimics that.
[01:41:36.186 --> 01:41:38.127]  There's like little subgroups.
[01:41:38.127 --> 01:41:41.208]  You go to your girlfriend at church or whatever, you know.
[01:41:41.208 --> 01:41:42.909]  Lie to that girlfriend repeatedly.
[01:41:42.909 --> 01:41:43.729]  That's how it works.
[01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:45.350]  You know, they take you to the club.
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:46.050]  They take you.
[01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:47.371]  Oh, let's go to this party in the woods.
[01:41:47.371 --> 01:41:48.111]  Let's go there, you know.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.321]  And then you go, wow, I'm really feeling weird.
[01:41:50.321 --> 01:41:54.685]  Well, yeah, we just slipped four hits of acid in your iced tea.
[01:41:54.685 --> 01:41:57.667]  And, you know, the rest is a big blur.
[01:41:57.667 --> 01:42:00.029]  Next, you know, I've taken over the whole operation one time.
[01:42:00.029 --> 01:42:00.969]  It was ridiculous.
[01:42:00.969 --> 01:42:03.011]  But OK, I'm stopping.
[01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:05.053]  That's fiction, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:05.053 --> 01:42:09.156]  But seriously, let's just say I've been there and back, OK?
[01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:12.258]  And these people are slaves.
[01:42:12.258 --> 01:42:14.600]  They don't have any power.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.641]  They're empty wraiths.
[01:42:17.105 --> 01:42:21.268]  And people like us that have a connection to God, we show up on the scene, we're in charge.
[01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.449]  Everybody already knows it.
[01:42:22.449 --> 01:42:25.892]  Because God gave us the keys to the planet once Satan's defeated.
[01:42:25.892 --> 01:42:27.613]  We have the deed.
[01:42:27.613 --> 01:42:29.235]  And the planet's going to be a joke at the end of the day.
[01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:30.115]  We won't even care about it.
[01:42:30.115 --> 01:42:32.777]  Because we've got the deed to the universe.
[01:42:32.777 --> 01:42:35.019]  We've got the whole plans.
[01:42:35.019 --> 01:42:37.001]  The whole nine yards.
[01:42:37.001 --> 01:42:39.743]  The entire enchilada grande!
[01:42:41.249 --> 01:42:46.494]  All right, final segment on the next false flag attack.
[01:42:46.494 --> 01:42:47.715]  Straight ahead.
[01:42:47.715 --> 01:42:49.777]  Stay with us, my friends.
[01:42:49.777 --> 01:42:51.358]  Infowars.com.
[01:42:51.358 --> 01:42:52.179]  Newswars.com.
[01:42:52.179 --> 01:42:54.501]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:42:58.292 --> 01:43:02.094]  I'm shooting this quick news alert on Friday, June 4th, 2021.
[01:43:02.094 --> 01:43:04.856]  You see this report from over a month ago?
[01:43:04.856 --> 01:43:08.958]  It's just now starting to break in the mainstream news as whistleblowers go public.
[01:43:08.958 --> 01:43:12.781]  But we broke it first and it's a banned out video with 1 million plus views.
[01:43:12.781 --> 01:43:15.422]  We've reposted the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:16.703]  The project manager for
[01:43:16.963 --> 01:43:22.266]  Or, Fauci bragged in an interview a year and a half ago how they created COVID-19.
[01:43:22.266 --> 01:43:26.367]  And then he secretly wrote the Lancet report claiming that it was naturally occurring.
[01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:30.589]  And then Big Tech worked with him to engage in fraud and since the American people.
[01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:33.651]  We're on air right now today and this weekend covering it all.
[01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:35.311]  I've been on air 27 years.
[01:44:00.876 --> 01:44:05.540]  And we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.103]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:44:09.103 --> 01:44:16.969]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[01:44:16.969 --> 01:44:20.672]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[01:44:20.672 --> 01:44:27.058]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[01:44:27.818 --> 01:44:31.463]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[01:44:31.463 --> 01:44:34.246]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[01:44:34.246 --> 01:44:38.831]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[01:44:38.831 --> 01:44:41.975]  And so InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:44.979]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[01:44:45.459 --> 01:44:47.341]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[01:44:47.341 --> 01:44:48.582]  It's so expensive.
[01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:53.867]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:53.867 --> 01:44:58.491]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-1 free shipping and double Patreon points.
[01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:09.402]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Pollen Block is, but you should go to InfoWarsStore.com and read the third-party review sites that we have links to where it's got five stars and people love it.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:18.637]  Pollen Block is a proprietary formula from France where they just learned by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet
[01:45:19.483 --> 01:45:27.286]  Produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies.
[01:45:27.286 --> 01:45:28.207]  It's back in stock.
[01:45:28.207 --> 01:45:29.547]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[01:45:29.547 --> 01:45:30.648]  It's very hard to get.
[01:45:30.648 --> 01:45:32.888]  Despite that, it's 40% off.
[01:45:32.888 --> 01:45:37.150]  We have storewide free shipping right now for Memorial Day and Double Patriot Point.
[01:45:37.150 --> 01:45:38.931]  So Pollen Block is back in stock.
[01:45:38.931 --> 01:45:40.231]  So is DNA Force.
[01:45:40.231 --> 01:45:41.392]  So are so many other great products.

[01:45:57.161 --> 01:45:58.642]  This stuff really, really works.
[01:45:58.642 --> 01:46:09.531]  There are now over a hundred peer-reviewed studies in just the last year documenting that surgical masks do nothing to stop the transmission and the spread of viruses.
[01:46:09.531 --> 01:46:10.451]  It's a hoax.
[01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:10.932]  It's a fraud.
[01:46:11.473 --> 01:46:17.423]  Here's another article on InfoWars.com, a major German study showing exactly the same thing.
[01:46:17.423 --> 01:46:18.484]  But Fauci knew that.
[01:46:18.484 --> 01:46:23.313]  He wrote a study himself, his name's on it, in 2008, saying not only
[01:46:24.031 --> 01:46:24.832]  Do masks not work?
[01:46:54.272 --> 01:46:54.652]  100% off.
[01:46:54.652 --> 01:46:55.333]  Check it out.
[01:46:55.333 --> 01:47:02.186]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:47:02.186 --> 01:47:04.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.028 --> 01:47:23.312]  I didn't mean to go off into a whole rant about the occult.
[01:47:45.788 --> 01:47:50.431]  But, uh, it's been attracting me like moths to flame.
[01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:57.215]  And I'm still here thanks to Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, and I am so blessed that I'll be firmly in God's hands.
[01:47:57.215 --> 01:47:59.596]  Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
[01:47:59.596 --> 01:48:00.937]  The deeper I get, the better.
[01:48:00.937 --> 01:48:02.318]  Praise God.
[01:48:02.318 --> 01:48:03.338]  Praise Jesus.
[01:48:03.338 --> 01:48:09.982]  Thank God I'm not in the hands of Satan.
[01:48:09.982 --> 01:48:12.684]  That's really all that matters, right?
[01:48:13.903 --> 01:48:19.686]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is taking over, and I guessed it right.
[01:48:19.686 --> 01:48:22.087]  He wasn't listening earlier, but they asked me, what are you covering?
[01:48:22.087 --> 01:48:24.428]  I'm covering Trump saying Biden will soon be gone.
[01:48:24.428 --> 01:48:27.849]  I'm taking calls, so I can kind of guess, because that's obviously the big story.
[01:48:27.849 --> 01:48:32.972]  I probably just should have played that clip, opened the phones up, would have been an incredible two hours.
[01:48:32.972 --> 01:48:35.673]  Instead, you get me pontificating.
[01:48:35.673 --> 01:48:38.554]  But I will open the phones up on that subject tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:48:38.554 --> 01:48:38.894]  Central.
[01:48:38.894 --> 01:48:41.236]  I would imagine Harrison Smith at 8 a.m.
[01:48:41.236 --> 01:48:42.036]  tomorrow will be doing it.
[01:48:42.978 --> 01:48:45.939]  Again, I don't call them and tell them what to do.
[01:48:45.939 --> 01:48:47.419]  Maybe once a month, I go, hey, did you see this?
[01:48:47.419 --> 01:48:51.820]  You're going to have this person on, but I don't like, because, you know, that's who I hire is folks that just seem to get it.
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.141]  You know, it's not like they get what I'm even saying.
[01:48:54.141 --> 01:48:54.761]  They already get it.
[01:48:54.761 --> 01:48:56.481]  It's like they're seeing the same thing.
[01:48:56.481 --> 01:48:57.762]  They're not seeing what I see.
[01:48:57.762 --> 01:48:59.822]  They already see the same thing separately.
[01:48:59.822 --> 01:49:01.623]  They're not carrying my message.
[01:49:01.623 --> 01:49:05.864]  They're carrying the message.
[01:49:05.864 --> 01:49:06.284]  And, you know,
[01:49:07.992 --> 01:49:11.554]  Like, Greg Reese will come out with a video that I don't even totally agree with sometimes.
[01:49:11.554 --> 01:49:15.576]  But that's okay, because sometimes I have different thoughts and different perspectives.
[01:49:15.576 --> 01:49:17.317]  That's good.
[01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:19.098]  Most of the time, I totally agree with it.
[01:49:19.098 --> 01:49:22.400]  But you don't always want to be totally agreeing.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.701]  You don't always want to just think you know everything.
[01:49:24.701 --> 01:49:26.122]  You want to learn.
[01:49:26.122 --> 01:49:27.223]  And I know that's why you're here.
[01:49:27.223 --> 01:49:30.765]  That's why I salute you, because I'm learning with you at the same time.
[01:49:30.765 --> 01:49:31.925]  It's amazing.
[01:49:31.925 --> 01:49:36.047]  And I am very thankful for God giving me consciousness so that I can commune with you.
[01:49:36.047 --> 01:49:36.868]  This is incredible.
[01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:42.280]  I can feel your strength, and your will, and your destiny!
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.501]  I love you!
[01:49:43.501 --> 01:50:03.736]  And I swear to you, on the altar of God, eternal resistance over every form of tyranny, over the mind of man, to quote Thomas Jefferson, I commit to you, that there is good in the universe, not just evil.
[01:50:03.736 --> 01:50:06.779]  There is truth, there is honor, there is
[01:50:07.586 --> 01:50:12.829]  Will to good, not just to evil.
[01:50:12.829 --> 01:50:14.429]  I know I'm for real.
[01:50:14.429 --> 01:50:16.050]  I know I tell the truth.
[01:50:16.050 --> 01:50:17.671]  I know I love God.
[01:50:17.671 --> 01:50:19.152]  I know God's real.
[01:50:19.152 --> 01:50:20.633]  I know I love you.
[01:50:20.633 --> 01:50:22.013]  I know you're real.
[01:50:22.013 --> 01:50:26.776]  They tell you all day there isn't truth, there isn't justice, there isn't the real thing.
[01:50:26.776 --> 01:50:29.397]  For all the counterfeits, there is the real thing.
[01:50:29.397 --> 01:50:31.418]  And you, my friends, are it.
[01:50:34.489 --> 01:50:40.773]  And it's that consciousness and that interfacing with God and recognizing God that is completion.
[01:50:40.773 --> 01:50:43.994]  That ability to recognize God.
[01:50:43.994 --> 01:50:46.035]  It doesn't matter if you can't pay your bills.
[01:50:46.035 --> 01:50:48.117]  It doesn't matter if you're starving to death.
[01:50:48.117 --> 01:50:52.079]  It doesn't matter if you're on your deathbed.
[01:50:52.079 --> 01:50:53.860]  None of that matters!
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.561]  Doesn't matter if you got a Rolex on your arm.
[01:50:56.561 --> 01:50:59.963]  It doesn't matter if you're flying on a private jet airplane.
[01:50:59.963 --> 01:51:03.105]  What matters is your connection to God.
[01:51:07.012 --> 01:51:10.773]  None of the stuff's bad in and of itself, but it's not God.
[01:51:10.773 --> 01:51:13.874]  It's not even close.
[01:51:13.874 --> 01:51:22.836]  It's just the trinkets that this body interfaces with, but it is the seeing a sunset and God's art and saying, I love you, God.
[01:51:22.836 --> 01:51:24.056]  Thank you for this.
[01:51:24.056 --> 01:51:25.157]  That's all God wants.
[01:51:25.157 --> 01:51:26.117]  God's lonely.
[01:51:27.378 --> 01:51:31.443]  God created us to commune with Him, to worship Him.
[01:51:31.443 --> 01:51:34.286]  And worship really doesn't mean bowing down in fear.
[01:51:34.286 --> 01:51:38.830]  It means worshiping because you are in simpatico.
[01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:41.914]  You are the bride, Christ is the groom.
[01:51:41.914 --> 01:51:48.161]  That's why Aleister Crowley and the Satanists try to make all their satanic rituals are about defiling the act of sex.
[01:51:49.085 --> 01:51:58.987]  Because the very act of consciousness, and meeting a woman, and having a child, and loving her, and loving him, and loving your children, and building a system, all of that is procreation.
[01:51:58.987 --> 01:52:00.447]  All of that is genesis.
[01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:01.827]  All of that is life.
[01:52:01.827 --> 01:52:08.389]  Art, and literature, and culture, and music, all of it is generation.
[01:52:08.389 --> 01:52:09.329]  It is building.
[01:52:09.329 --> 01:52:10.369]  It is life.
[01:52:10.369 --> 01:52:12.309]  It is the gift of creation.
[01:52:12.309 --> 01:52:13.670]  It is consciousness.
[01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:14.830]  It is all sex.
[01:52:17.336 --> 01:52:18.597]  Is the coming together.
[01:52:18.597 --> 01:52:20.858]  The Congress.
[01:52:20.858 --> 01:52:22.838]  God gave you sex.
[01:52:22.838 --> 01:52:24.299]  God gave you power.
[01:52:24.299 --> 01:52:29.361]  God gave you that big heart and that red blood and that strength and that vision.
[01:52:29.361 --> 01:52:35.124]  If you can see beauty, you have been given everything.
[01:52:35.124 --> 01:52:37.104]  Do you think the Satanist sees beauty?
[01:52:37.104 --> 01:52:42.467]  They see only ugliness because they're turned from God.
[01:52:42.467 --> 01:52:45.368]  Because they're ashamed of their nakedness.
[01:52:46.428 --> 01:52:54.610]  Because they see something that awesome and they don't decide to join with it in their free will to be perfected.
[01:52:54.610 --> 01:53:02.271]  They decide instead to do whatever doesn't work and to go against it and that is sin.
[01:53:02.271 --> 01:53:04.732]  That's all.
[01:53:04.732 --> 01:53:06.992]  There's God's plan.
[01:53:06.992 --> 01:53:09.073]  There's Satan's plan.
[01:53:09.073 --> 01:53:11.873]  And you can say, oh, I'm not with Satan either.
[01:53:11.873 --> 01:53:14.014]  I'm a real Satanist.
[01:53:14.014 --> 01:53:15.554]  I make my own world.
[01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:18.351]  I'm gonna kill the devil!
[01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:24.375]  I'm gonna go down to hell, and I'm gonna be so evil, they're all gonna serve me!
[01:53:24.375 --> 01:53:28.637]  It's a load of crap.
[01:53:28.637 --> 01:53:45.588]  You're gonna sink to the heart of a black hole, with other entities just like you, and it's gonna be a nightmare hell, because all there'll be is eternal ugliness, because you won't have the light and the goodness to screw over anymore, and to feel like as you vandalize God's creation, that somehow you're in charge.
[01:53:46.647 --> 01:53:55.476]  You will be destroyed, because you will be cut off from the multiverse.
[01:53:55.476 --> 01:54:04.686]  So I felt like preaching tonight, and I said I would hit this big news, so let me just try to hit this, and then the other stuff I'll hit tomorrow.
[01:54:04.686 --> 01:54:06.768]  And then Owen Schroyer is taking over for the next two hours.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.181]  Instead of just running on for 10 hours about it, let me just tell you what's going to happen.
[01:54:12.181 --> 01:54:13.521]  How do I know what's going to happen next?
[01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:18.843]  Well, there's a lot of ways I do that, but the easiest thing is they pre-program before they do it.
[01:54:18.843 --> 01:54:33.327]  And the globalists then brag and say, we're going to bring down the industrialized society, because we're going to collapse the third world and flood the first world, and we're going to cut off commodities and manipulate things and get people to not have a family and to not be upwardly mobile and
[01:54:34.392 --> 01:54:35.436]  Turn their life force off.
[01:54:35.436 --> 01:54:38.304]  We're gonna chemically attack them and dumb them down.
[01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:40.712]  We're gonna distract them with movies and video games.
[01:54:40.712 --> 01:54:41.575]  You know about all that!
[01:54:42.856 --> 01:54:54.603]  But in their own literature they say, and we're going to basically, you know, society's going to fall, wink wink wink, we're going to take over, because hackers are going to get worse and worse, and they're going to start hijacking and shutting major systems down.
[01:54:54.603 --> 01:55:04.609]  That's their excuse to start turning your lights out, jacking up your power, training you to not have stuff because they want to take it away from you, and they're going to say these magic hackers are doing it, when it's them!
[01:55:05.583 --> 01:55:16.488]  Who are going to charge you more for less resources, keep it for themselves, and train you to be scrabbling around trying to get your electricity on instead of worrying about politics and what's happening.
[01:55:16.488 --> 01:55:32.975]  They want to keep you in a subsistence, subservient level, that's what feudalism is, so that you're so busy gribbling the ground in the dirt and grime trying to not starve to death so you don't have time to read Greek philosophy.
[01:55:32.975 --> 01:55:33.315]  That's all.
[01:55:35.322 --> 01:55:36.884]  Period!
[01:55:36.884 --> 01:55:38.925]  They don't want you on the ball field.
[01:55:38.925 --> 01:55:40.567]  They don't want to look at you on the highway.
[01:55:40.567 --> 01:55:41.508]  They want you dead.
[01:55:41.508 --> 01:55:42.789]  They stole the planet.
[01:55:42.789 --> 01:55:43.990]  They stole it with fraud.
[01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:46.613]  And now they want you out of the way.
[01:55:46.613 --> 01:55:51.197]  And again, people say, well, why don't we just join them then?
[01:55:51.197 --> 01:55:53.379]  You can't join with this.
[01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:54.360]  It will destroy you.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:55.181]  They're delusional.
[01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:56.242]  They're idiots.
[01:55:56.242 --> 01:55:59.405]  The job is fixing all these people and helping them get to God.
[01:56:00.243 --> 01:56:02.424]  Not screwing them over because they're fallen?
[01:56:02.424 --> 01:56:06.986]  You think God's gonna lift us up if we screw all these fallen people over?
[01:56:06.986 --> 01:56:12.028]  You think God lifted you up so you can piss on these people, you dumbass devil worshippers?
[01:56:12.028 --> 01:56:20.291]  Just because you know more than the person you're feeding on, you think that makes you enlightened and empowered because you're keeping people in the dark?
[01:56:20.291 --> 01:56:28.915]  God is gonna smash your ass flat in a pancake and relegate you to the heart of a black hole, you dumb bastards!
[01:56:30.518 --> 01:56:37.241]  And I take no pleasure in where you're going.
[01:56:37.241 --> 01:56:38.622]  Satan is a loser.
[01:56:38.622 --> 01:56:39.662]  Satan is a joke.
[01:56:39.662 --> 01:56:40.903]  God is everything.
[01:56:40.903 --> 01:56:42.744]  Period!
[01:56:42.744 --> 01:56:44.925]  Get with the program or go be a loser!
[01:56:45.535 --> 01:56:51.118]  But realize you've been given consciences for a reason, for the choice and the decision you're making right now.
[01:56:51.118 --> 01:56:52.839]  And I'll cover it more at the start of the show tomorrow.
[01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:55.161]  Cyber Polygon's finally in the news.
[01:56:55.161 --> 01:57:03.625]  Zero Hedge wrote a great article mirroring what we've been saying, but showing how they always run drills as the cover for what they're actually planning, so they don't go to prison when they actually launch it.
[01:57:03.625 --> 01:57:04.826]  It's all here.
[01:57:04.826 --> 01:57:06.187]  It's all here.
[01:57:06.187 --> 01:57:07.608]  Cyber Polygon.
[01:57:07.608 --> 01:57:11.330]  Will the next globalist war game lead to another convenient catastrophe?
[01:57:13.783 --> 01:57:16.264]  Crack the code, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:16.264 --> 01:57:18.104]  See it for itself.
[01:57:18.104 --> 01:57:27.606]  And realize that little blood-bat, vampire-bat gremlin only has power over you, his name's LaSchwab, when you don't recognize who he is.
[01:57:27.606 --> 01:57:32.367]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist!
[01:57:32.367 --> 01:57:34.047]  Evil does exist!
[01:57:34.047 --> 01:57:35.727]  Face it and deal with it!
[01:57:35.727 --> 01:57:38.128]  Because it's good news, because good also exists.
[01:57:38.994 --> 01:57:39.334]  All right.
[01:57:39.334 --> 01:57:42.517]  Let's go out and free shipping ends today and the big sale.
[01:57:42.517 --> 01:57:43.678]  Appreciate all your support.
[01:57:43.678 --> 01:57:44.519]  Owen Schroeder takes over.
[01:57:48.041 --> 01:57:56.528]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:56.528 --> 01:58:07.056]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[01:58:07.056 --> 01:58:16.703]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[01:58:17.043 --> 01:58:23.030]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:27.875]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[01:58:27.875 --> 01:58:38.267]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava but other herbs including but not limited to German chamomile, organic
[01:58:38.527 --> 01:58:39.268]  I think so.
[01:58:48.627 --> 01:59:12.681]  Memorial Day 2021 is here and that means store-wide free shipping and double patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com and on top of it a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock and that's a good thing because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[01:59:12.681 --> 01:59:14.542]  All of them are amazing but DNA
[01:59:14.582 --> 01:59:17.083]  Of course, plus is again the flagship.
[01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.924]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:21.884]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[01:59:21.884 --> 01:59:23.785]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[01:59:23.785 --> 01:59:24.925]  The list goes on and on.
[01:59:24.925 --> 01:59:30.487]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:59:30.487 --> 01:59:32.168]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[01:59:32.168 --> 01:59:33.768]  What else is back in stock?
[01:59:33.768 --> 01:59:35.489]  People are very excited to hear.
[01:59:35.489 --> 01:59:36.709]  Pollen Block for
