[00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:37.082]  It's Tuesday, July 20th of the year.
[00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:39.023]  It's 2021.
[00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.824]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:46.086]  And we are seeing history take place in front of all of our eyes.
[00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:52.248]  We're seeing world government with the express aim of sterilizing and killing us.
[00:00:53.468 --> 00:01:05.774]  Openly establishing a worldwide medical ID passport system that will finally end with an implantable microchip under the skin, in the words of the United Nations head operative, Klaus Schwab.
[00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:20.082]  And that's where we are, and they're saying it's a new world order everywhere, and with it is the sexual indoctrination of your children, your parental rights being taken, and your children being sterilized as young as age three in phase one.
[00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:46.951]  Phase 2, at birth, a helmet will be put over your children and they will be programmed from birth in a 360 virtual reality into the quote, new way of thinking with direct neural interaction with the AI, ever mind.
[00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.534]  They call this direct neural intervention
[00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:56.315]  So that the racism and the inherent evilness of your child will be gotten rid of.
[00:01:56.315 --> 00:02:03.577]  The left will line up to have his children mounted at birth in the trial programs, turning them into even further autistic zombies.
[00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:05.978]  And there's no level the left won't follow.
[00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:10.999]  When the left husband or wife dies of the shot, they go take it themselves.
[00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.800]  They line up to give newborn babies the deadly shot.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.821]  They want to die and they want to take us with them.
[00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.142]  They've been turned over to a great illusion.
[00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:30.652]  Well, it's happened in Greece, it's happened in France, now it's been announced in the UK, it's all the UN-directed program that you must have an injection to leave your house and go to the grocery store.
[00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:41.001]  Of course, they're starting out with football games and concerts to have the big corporations forcing on you, and then it'll roll on down to the smaller restaurants and bars.
[00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.864]  But Johnson's saying you'll be arrested and given multiple years in prison.
[00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.106]  If you don't do it, the exact same thing's been announced in France.
[00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:50.184]  Remember we told you a year and a half ago this was coming.
[00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:52.393]  It was the official UN globalist plan.
[00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:57.509]  It's like Fauci came out and said, make three-year-olds wear two masks last week.
[00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.332]  And I said, by next week, the major medical associations will say, never take masks off.
[00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:03.133]  And they announced it today.
[00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.654]  They said, never take masks off.
[00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:07.576]  This is a cult of psychotic murderers.
[00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.457]  Fauci ran the whole Wuhan lab.
[00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:10.958]  They released the damn virus.
[00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.280]  The vaccine is worse than the virus, but does what the virus does.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.362]  It just has your body grow the virus with a spike protein.
[00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:17.943]  This is just
[00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:26.829]  An apocalypse unfolding, but the public has Stockholm Syndrome and can't admit it's happening, and so they rationalize and make excuses about what's going on.
[00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:38.057]  That's why it's key for the globalist program that we be taken off air and others be taken off air, and that no medical doctors be able to challenge this as they are, so they can gaslight everyone to death.
[00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:39.959]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us on the other side.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.383]  of this break to talk about what it's like to live right in the middle of Airstrip One.
[00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:49.567]  But here's Boris Johnson yesterday celebrating Freedom Day, Orwellian term.
[00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:53.009]  And then, of course, there were tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands out protesting.
[00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.610]  The police brutally attacked them.
[00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:03.777]  We have hours of footage of women being run over with horses, billy clubbed in the head by the paramilitary, satanic forces that are now in control of the UK.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:04.918]  God help us.
[00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:07.039]  Notice Black Lives Matter and criticizing these cops.
[00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.540]  They love them.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.880]  Here it is.
[00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:25.480]  I should serve notice now that by the end of September, when all over 18s will have had their chance to be double jabbed, we're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.144]  Proof of a negative test will no longer be enough.
[00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:30.705]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:31.246]  Arrest Boris Johnson!

[00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:42.292]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:42.832]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:43.412]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:43.412 --> 00:04:44.133]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:44.553]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:44.553 --> 00:04:45.093]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:45.093 --> 00:04:45.674]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:47.235]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:47.735]  Arrest Boris Johnson!

[00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:49.796]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:50.336]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:50.937]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:51.577]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:52.958]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.118]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:54.579]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:55.079]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.719]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.220]  Arrest Boris Johnson!
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.660]  Arrest Boris Johnson
[00:04:58.203 --> 00:05:06.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:16.548]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:17.288 --> 00:05:20.213]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:21.394]  Listen to this.
[00:05:21.394 --> 00:05:22.656]  Organic pea fiber.

[00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:28.425]  Organic kale leaf.

[00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.590]  Organic quinoa sprout.

[00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:11.342]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:13.143]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:15.024]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:16.724]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.724 --> 00:06:18.385]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:23.087]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:29.507]  Globalist mole now fully activated.
[00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:44.780]  Boris Johnson has joined the UN, Klaus Schwab, Macron and others in announcing the medical passport forced experimental injection that will finally lead to not being able to leave your home and forced imprisonment if you don't accept the medical tyranny.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.202]  Here he is announcing it on Freedom Day yesterday.
[00:06:47.202 --> 00:06:55.889]  I should certainly let you know that by the end of September when all over 18s will have had their chance to be double jabbed
[00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:05.077]  We're planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.
[00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:09.961]  Proof of a negative test will no longer be an option.
[00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:29.120]  Arrest Fauci.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.360]  Arrest Bill Gates.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.320]  They ran the lab.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.661]  They ran the program.
[00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.841]  They released it.
[00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.342]  They plan to never end the lockdown.
[00:07:35.342 --> 00:07:36.342]  I told you this.
[00:07:36.342 --> 00:07:38.803]  I told Paul this a year and a half ago.
[00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:43.605]  I told Eddie Bravo the lockdowns were going to come back to Los Angeles within months of them ending them.
[00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:45.365]  Now it's all started again.
[00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.706]  It is a post-industrial world.
[00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:49.327]  First they take you off the land.
[00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:50.747]  Then they take you out of the factories.
[00:07:50.747 --> 00:07:52.408]  Then they say you're a service economy.
[00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:54.709]  Then they say you're obsolete, non-essential.
[00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:58.932]  Well, he's been with us 20 years and now he runs Summit.News.
[00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:04.094]  Paul Joseph Watson right in the middle of this incredible time.
[00:08:04.094 --> 00:08:05.434]  Talk about Orwellian.
[00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:09.975]  On Freedom Day, Boris Johnson announces mandatory vaccine passports.
[00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:13.516]  Giant crowds all over the country coming out and protesting.
[00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:17.598]  Brutally then attacked by the police.
[00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:18.898]  I guess if they were Islamist or
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.622]  Pedophiles, it would have been okay.
[00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:24.907]  Paul Joseph Watson, thanks for joining us at the kickoff of the transmission.
[00:08:24.907 --> 00:08:28.592]  Give us your expert and in-person analysis of what's unfolding.
[00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:36.340]  Well, what's unfolding, Alex, is firstly, those protests that you just played a clip of are not being played in the news.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.401]  They get no news coverage whatsoever.
[00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:51.384]  The only coverage they get is on Twitter by middle-class, privileged leftists dehumanising them, calling them gammon, calling them scum, calling them co-vidiots while they're getting beaten in the face by the police.
[00:08:52.208 --> 00:09:02.257]  Remember we had a whole, what, several months, a whole summer of this last year with Black Lives Matter being treated similarly in some circumstances, but also themselves violently attacking the police.
[00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:03.679]  The media covered it.
[00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.981]  They ran defense for Black Lives Matter.
[00:09:05.981 --> 00:09:07.562]  This doesn't even get on the news.
[00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:08.984]  You would think protests of
[00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:17.513]  100,000 people, the last major one a couple of weekends ago, in the capital city would get news coverage.
[00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:19.453]  Now it barely gets any.
[00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:24.935]  But the good thing, Alex, is that these protests are growing because they still have a reason to protest.
[00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:32.237]  There was a conservative news outlet called Guido Fawkes yesterday who ran a headline saying, why are they out protesting?
[00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:35.098]  They've got their freedom back.
[00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:36.719]  Okay, freedom to conform.
[00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:56.622]  Within minutes of these scenes that you see now, Boris Johnson announced, as you said, that we're going to have vaccine passports initially for nightclubs, today they're talking about maybe for pubs, they're talking about definitely for football matches, and they present it as, oh you just have to show your Covid certification.
[00:09:56.622 --> 00:10:03.708]  No, this is about banning dissidents who refuse to take vaccines and then rolling them and putting them on lists
[00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:11.339]  To create the entree to the Chinese communist style social credit score system, which we've been warning about for years.
[00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:13.881]  Boris Johnson himself, Alex, said.
[00:10:14.793 --> 00:10:19.437]  In regard to ID cards, which the vaccine passport is basically the same thing.
[00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:25.141]  The mock-ups that the government paid these corporations to create had name, photograph, date of birth.
[00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:26.082]  It's an ID card.
[00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:29.244]  It's even worse than that because it has your entire medical history.
[00:10:29.244 --> 00:10:35.248]  But in 2004 when Blair, who by the way has pushed the vaccine passport for the past 15 months,
[00:10:36.986 --> 00:10:45.792]  When Blair was trying to pass the National ID Card in the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson called it, quote, a recipe for tyranny and oppression.
[00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:51.275]  And here we are in 2021 and he's introducing the exact same thing.
[00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:54.897]  So the restrictions were supposedly lifted yesterday.
[00:10:54.897 --> 00:10:57.259]  And yet I went for a walk yesterday.
[00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:59.160]  I went for a walk today near where I live.
[00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:08.795]  75 to 90% of the people, I would say, are still wearing masks inside shops, despite the fact that it's not a law anymore, you don't have to do that.
[00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:22.662]  I saw a family masked up outside, bearing in mind it was the hottest day of the year in the UK today, eating their lunch in between putting the mask back on, taking it off, having a bite, putting it back on.
[00:11:22.662 --> 00:11:27.345]  There are tons of people wearing masks outside in the hottest week of the year.
[00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:29.484]  People have been terrified.
[00:11:29.484 --> 00:11:30.585]  They've been brainwashed.
[00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:34.386]  And when I say that, it's not a superficial cliché.
[00:11:34.386 --> 00:11:39.387]  We know they were brainwashed because, as you used to say, Alex, we've got the documents.
[00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:42.688]  And this was the decision that was made at the start of the pandemic back in March 2020.
[00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:43.368]  They deviated
[00:11:46.078 --> 00:12:01.070]  From the normal response to every single historical pandemic in the past, which was to go for herd immunity, and instead they chose to terrify people by making them more afraid of the threat, the actual threat that the virus posed.
[00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.712]  And the documents have all been released.
[00:12:03.192 --> 00:12:07.374]  This was the SAGE, Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group.
[00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:19.239]  Bearing in mind, these people advising the government on these measures, with regard to masks, social distancing, etc, they're not virologists, they're not medical scientists, they're behavioral psychologists.
[00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:25.162]  So they made the decision after Boris Johnson initially said, let's go for herd immunity, it's what we've done in the past.
[00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:28.363]  And by the way, Paul, just to interrupt you, you're not just saying this,
[00:12:29.162 --> 00:12:32.583]  They're all over the news saying we used mind control, close quote.
[00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:34.044]  We terrorized them.
[00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:43.188]  And they're already on the news here saying 99% of the new cases are unvaccinated, even though 46% of hospitalizations are the vaccinated.
[00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:44.428]  They're saying got COVID.
[00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:48.670]  Now, eight Democrats that flew on that plane tested positive, even though they were already vaccinated.
[00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.032]  I was talking to Joe Rogan last night.
[00:12:51.032 --> 00:12:54.955]  He knows a whole bunch of people, personally, that got the vaccine and got super ill from it.
[00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:56.296]  Then they tell them it's COVID.
[00:12:56.296 --> 00:12:59.819]  Everyone around me that ended up getting the shot got super sick off of it, Paul.
[00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:04.543]  But again, they're using psychological warfare on people, as you pointed out.
[00:13:04.543 --> 00:13:06.164]  Yeah, and why did they get the shot?
[00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:07.606]  And they can flash up this headline.
[00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:12.550]  It's how they telegraph life inside the fear factory, how the government keeps them on high alert.
[00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:17.309]  And this was when they came out and they got the documents, it's all been released.
[00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:31.424]  They admit using totalitarian mind control methods and the weaponization of behavioral psychology because they said at the start of the first lockdown, quote, people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened.
[00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:38.089]  So that's when all these advertisements came out about you're going to kill granny, you're spreading the virus everywhere.
[00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:40.471]  That's when the mask propaganda came out.
[00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:47.496]  Because before this obviously Fauci was in his own emails saying masks are pathetic, they're useless, they don't stop the virus.
[00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:54.362]  Now we know from another report yesterday, and I've been talking about this for the best part of the past six months,
[00:13:55.123 --> 00:14:05.147]  All those blue surgical masks that people are wearing, the gaps in those masks are 1,000 times the size of the COVID particle.
[00:14:05.147 --> 00:14:10.769]  So this government scientist who bravely came out and said this, Dr Colin Axon, made the analogy.
[00:14:10.769 --> 00:14:15.010]  It's like throwing marbles at builders' scaffolding.
[00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:20.612]  If the marble is the virus particle, yeah, a few of them are going to bounce off and hit the scaffolding.
[00:14:20.612 --> 00:14:23.093]  The vast majority are going straight through.
[00:14:24.774 --> 00:14:29.316]  The analogy is you could fly a Boeing 747 through that mask if it was a virus.
[00:14:29.316 --> 00:14:30.417]  They don't work.
[00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:32.178]  Fauci admitted they didn't work.
[00:14:32.178 --> 00:14:38.802]  Our own medical health official, the top guy, Chris Whitty, said February 2020 they don't work.
[00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:42.064]  Why did they make the decision to make everyone suddenly start wearing them?
[00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:47.727]  Because they shifted from a medical response to a justified threat of what the pandemic represented.
[00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:58.167]  To a behavioral mind control approach, which is if we can get people to submit to this, we can basically get them to submit to anything.
[00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:00.448]  And now they're submitting to the vaccine passport.
[00:15:00.448 --> 00:15:02.090]  And Paul, that's what we'll come back with.
[00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.610]  Exactly.
[00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.313]  Now they're saying children two and up must wear two masks.
[00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:13.434]  With all the problems with carbon dioxide, all the problems of development children, this is serious oppression.
[00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:15.016]  This is serious child abuse.
[00:15:15.016 --> 00:15:20.983]  And now they want to give below 12-year-olds these shots that are in no danger of COVID, but have all the side effects.
[00:15:20.983 --> 00:15:23.927]  Is that not pure evil, Paul?
[00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:26.290]  Well, we had the numbers come out a couple of weeks ago.
[00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:33.499]  25 people under the age of 18 died from COVID in the UK across a year period.
[00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:36.121]  Two-thirds of those had serious illnesses.
[00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:45.845]  So it's literally, you can almost count on one hand the number of under 18s who died of COVID in the UK, and yet suddenly all the kids need to get vaccinated and wear masks.
[00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:48.687]  All right, summit.news is his own independent site.
[00:15:48.687 --> 00:15:49.247]  It's excellent.
[00:15:49.247 --> 00:15:50.848]  In fact, I'm jealous of it.
[00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:54.110]  But again, everybody's got to move out and leave home someday.
[00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.791]  Paul Joseph Watson, my little baby, when we come back.
[00:16:00.074 --> 00:16:02.156]  Your voice counts.
[00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:07.220]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.802]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.303]  They know you're angry.
[00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:16.687]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:06.172]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:23.506]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:27.129]  Worse than slaves, they're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:35.853]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[00:17:35.853 --> 00:17:45.880]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.063]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[00:17:50.063 --> 00:17:52.244]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[00:17:52.244 --> 00:17:54.506]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.508]  It is a spiritual battle, and M4 is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:01.355]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena.
[00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:03.756]  A man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart.
[00:18:03.756 --> 00:18:07.758]  People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right.
[00:18:07.758 --> 00:18:13.881]  The audits are coming out and there was total, absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:14.321]  That is
[00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:16.262]  The bottom line.
[00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:22.268]  And Mike Lindell is getting sued by all these big powerful globalist institutions trying to shut him down.
[00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:30.936]  That's why it's so important to support MyPillow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America.
[00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:33.158]  Because he's doing God's work.
[00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:35.420]  And at the same time, he's funding InfoWars.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:35.940]  That's right.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.042]  When you use promo code ALEX at checkout,

[00:18:56.115 --> 00:19:01.159]  MyPillow.com, promo code ALEX.
[00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:03.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:18.507 --> 00:19:18.587]  Yeah.
[00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:40.614]  Welcome back.
[00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:42.515]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:53.322]  Paul Joseph Watson from Summit.News is with us for another segment from right smack dab in the middle of the World Government Takeover.
[00:19:53.322 --> 00:20:04.050]  The World ID to have a World Social Credit score to where they can turn that ID to leave your home and to travel and to go to a restaurant or go to the park.
[00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.611]  I mean to go to the grocery store.
[00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.112]  This is all that announces their plan.
[00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:10.211]  And they're introducing it via the virus.
[00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:14.857]  And their own books, their own admissions, their own white papers from the Rockefeller Foundation admit that.
[00:20:14.857 --> 00:20:21.925]  And now the Rockefeller Foundation is in charge of all of Biden's anti-free speech propaganda.
[00:20:21.925 --> 00:20:26.610]  Trying to silence all these scientists and medical doctors and victims of these shots.
[00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.391]  Paul, you've been...
[00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:29.223]  We're good to go.
[00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:58.777]  I mean, it's kind of surreal because you don't want to believe it yourself, and then you want to warn people to try and roll it back, and that's what we've attempted to do, and I think we've been successful in many ways.
[00:20:58.777 --> 00:21:01.498]  But you still don't quite believe that it could be this bad.
[00:21:01.498 --> 00:21:03.899]  But it is this bad!
[00:21:18.627 --> 00:21:21.929]  And you talk about the media, social media censorship.
[00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:24.450]  This isn't coming just from YouTube.
[00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:35.016]  Here in the United Kingdom, and it's the same in America, the people responsible for getting all those videos of the medical doctors warning about all this banned from YouTube, banned from Facebook,
[00:21:36.053 --> 00:21:39.494]  This is literally the UK military, okay?
[00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:48.937]  The UK military is only supposed to direct propaganda to foreign adversaries, and yet we have something called the 77th Brigade in the United Kingdom.
[00:21:48.937 --> 00:21:59.700]  What they did, Alex, at the start of the pandemic, was they took Chinese government propaganda, hyping the hysteria, hyping the threat of this virus, to the point where
[00:22:00.447 --> 00:22:09.394]  You remember those videos of all the Chinese people in the street convulsing and falling over, even though now we know that was never even a claimed symptom of COVID.
[00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:19.461]  Our military, our GCHQ, took those videos and artificially amplified them through social media and through the conventional media to the point where
[00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:32.842]  You now have replies under tweets about the latest lockdown announcement, and it's literally word for word people agreeing with the lockdown and saying it should be even worse, and I've tweeted those on many occasions.
[00:22:32.842 --> 00:22:36.983]  Sure, and putting out all the fake polls, you know, 80% of a lockdown will never end.
[00:22:36.983 --> 00:22:43.945]  This is your military, my military, under globalist control, literally waging war on free open societies.
[00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.125]  This is criminal activity.
[00:22:46.525 --> 00:22:49.307]  And it's worked to a great extent, if you believe some of the polls.
[00:22:49.307 --> 00:23:05.797]  There was a poll conducted by an organisation which is not affiliated with the government, which I've talked about before, from August last summer, which found that the average Brit thought that 100 times more people had died of coronavirus than actually had according to the official numbers.
[00:23:05.797 --> 00:23:07.078]  So it worked to some extent.
[00:23:07.078 --> 00:23:14.663]  And you look at the official numbers, for example, in the UK, someone did a Freedom of Information Act request to the government and they said, OK, so tell us,
[00:23:15.183 --> 00:23:21.169]  How many people in the UK died from COVID alone with no other comorbidities?
[00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:30.317]  They came back, and this is still on the government website, and said the total was 8.9% of the official death toll died from COVID alone.
[00:23:30.317 --> 00:23:35.482]  So it's more than 10 times less, yet the British population thinks it's 100 times
[00:23:37.063 --> 00:23:44.606]  Paul, in the time we have, you're going to be hosting the whole fourth hour today and knocking it out of the park because what's happening in the UK is coming everywhere else tomorrow.
[00:23:44.606 --> 00:23:46.106]  Canada's still under lockdown.
[00:23:46.106 --> 00:23:47.107]  Australia never left it.
[00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:48.947]  I mean, this is a globally directed thing.
[00:23:48.947 --> 00:23:50.288]  What do we do to say no?
[00:23:50.288 --> 00:23:53.549]  I mean, I think we've got to prosecute the people that cooked this plan up.
[00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:56.210]  The Rockefeller Foundation, Gates, Fauci.
[00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.091]  We've got to go after the Wuhan lab.
[00:23:58.091 --> 00:24:03.713]  We've got to discredit the people that have rolled this out who own the patents on the vaccines and who have conflict of interest.
[00:24:04.173 --> 00:24:15.575]  Instead of just battling every new tyranny they roll out, we need to just point out they're villains, this is a great reset plan, and thank God these criminals have basically bragged that they did all this, Paul.
[00:24:15.575 --> 00:24:21.876]  They've bragged they did it all, and all the documents have come out, yet the vast majority of people are still unaware of that, so it's about circulating that message.
[00:24:21.876 --> 00:24:29.338]  It's about going after them legally, as you've said, and there's an organization in the UK called Big Brother Watch which is going to do that, going to sue the government.
[00:24:29.338 --> 00:24:30.198]  The good news is,
[00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:38.526]  The nightclub owners, some of the nightclub owners came out today after this announcement and said, our profit margins are literally 10, 15, 20%.
[00:24:38.526 --> 00:24:42.750]  If you eliminate 10, 20, 15% of the British population, bearing in mind 35% of 18 to 30 year olds haven't had the vaccine,
[00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:51.657]  That's going to completely eliminate their profit margin.
[00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:53.038]  They're all going to shut down.
[00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:56.701]  We've had 10% of restaurants in the UK being shut down.
[00:24:56.701 --> 00:25:03.386]  Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the billionaires, have made vast sums of money from this lockdown.
[00:25:03.386 --> 00:25:06.748]  150 million people going into extreme poverty.
[00:25:06.748 --> 00:25:08.790]  So you go at it from that angle.
[00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.932]  And you also protest non-violent civil disobedience.
[00:25:11.932 --> 00:25:14.774]  We've seen what's happened in Greece and France over the past couple of weeks.
[00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.873]  The French love to riot, and they'll riot at the drop of a hat.
[00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:21.395]  The UK population's a bit more sedate.
[00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:23.437]  But they've got Macron already.
[00:25:23.437 --> 00:25:29.963]  After he first tried to introduce it in December, vaccine passports didn't even go into supermarkets.
[00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:33.466]  They've got him to roll it back where supermarkets has been eliminated.
[00:25:34.006 --> 00:25:34.647]  Yes, we are.
[00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:54.250]  Millions over time in the UK, almost no coverage.
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:26:03.051]  But the good news is, a federal judge in Germany ruled YouTube was fined 100,000 euros for blocking even news coverage of the protest.
[00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:11.792]  And now, as you said earlier, mainline YouTubers are being blocked from showing the protest because they're calling protesting lockdowns misinformation.
[00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:16.573]  So this is Soviet-level tyranny, all in the name of stopping medical disinfo.
[00:26:16.573 --> 00:26:19.114]  How is protesting a lockdown medical disinfo?
[00:26:19.114 --> 00:26:20.634]  It's just an outrageous power grab, Paul.
[00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:25.824]  No, they literally ban YouTube videos that just show protesters carrying placards.
[00:26:25.824 --> 00:26:35.751]  And what was funny about this yesterday was this media outlet called Guido Fawkes mocked all these conspiracy theorists for saying, why are you protesting when there's nothing left to protest?
[00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:42.256]  Then their video of the protest in London yesterday, within about two hours, got banned by YouTube.
[00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:47.140]  And they had to come back and say, well, I guess maybe the conspiracy theorists were right after all.
[00:26:49.068 --> 00:26:50.311]  This is such a tyranny.
[00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.138]  This has nothing to do with this virus.
[00:26:53.138 --> 00:26:57.590]  Klaus Schwab that runs it all admits it's about carbon taxes and now they want carbon lockdowns, Paul!
[00:26:59.594 --> 00:27:06.396]  Yeah, and they're exploiting these floods in Europe, which are as a result of the dams not being properly maintained in Germany and other countries.
[00:27:06.396 --> 00:27:14.158]  And they've openly said, you know, the World Economic Forum bragged, all the streets are so quiet during lockdown, we've reduced carbon emissions.
[00:27:14.158 --> 00:27:15.258]  We're going to do that again.
[00:27:15.258 --> 00:27:21.940]  So any justification, any excuse to include, expand state power and enslave the population.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.900]  That's why we need to fight it.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.760]  Submission leads to death.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.521]  Resistance leads to a good life.
[00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:27.761]  Summit.News.
[00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:28.962]  Paul, you're hosting the fourth hour.
[00:27:28.962 --> 00:27:29.902]  We've got 30 seconds.
[00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:30.622]  What are you going to be covering?
[00:27:30.622 --> 00:27:36.464]  I'm going to be covering the latest out of France, the vaccine passports.
[00:27:36.464 --> 00:27:40.485]  Now, as I said before, these nightclub owners are saying they're going to resist it.
[00:27:40.485 --> 00:27:43.086]  They're not going to force people to show them upon entry.
[00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:46.487]  So the pushback, the backlash is raging.
[00:27:46.487 --> 00:27:46.887]  All right.
[00:27:46.887 --> 00:27:48.687]  See you in the fourth hour today.
[00:27:48.687 --> 00:27:49.047]  Thank you.
[00:27:49.047 --> 00:27:50.628]  Paul Joseph Watson, Summit.News.
[00:27:51.408 --> 00:27:55.270]  I'm Alex Jones with FreeWorldNews.TV.
[00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.813]  FreeWorldNews.TV.
[00:27:58.813 --> 00:28:02.515]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:11.080]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:18.735]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.
[00:28:18.735 --> 00:28:22.218]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:31.887]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[00:28:32.407 --> 00:28:33.428]  But that's it.
[00:28:33.428 --> 00:28:35.830]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.792]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:28:37.792 --> 00:28:40.033]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:28:40.033 --> 00:28:41.315]  It's the highest quality.
[00:28:41.315 --> 00:28:42.476]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.

[00:28:56.827 --> 00:28:58.509]  So take action now while you still can.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.401]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:29:03.401 --> 00:29:03.801]  Welcome.
[00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:04.242]  Go ahead.
[00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.543]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.204]  Great last caller.
[00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:10.266]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:29:10.266 --> 00:29:15.971]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:29:15.971 --> 00:29:17.752]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[00:29:18.112 --> 00:29:18.493]  All right.
[00:29:18.493 --> 00:29:19.754]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:29:19.754 --> 00:29:20.695]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:29:20.695 --> 00:29:21.035]  Go ahead.
[00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:21.475]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:21.475 --> 00:29:22.616]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:29:22.616 --> 00:29:25.639]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.321]  The X Team does wonders.
[00:29:27.321 --> 00:29:29.623]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[00:29:29.623 --> 00:29:30.424]  Get off the fence.
[00:29:30.424 --> 00:29:31.104]  Get the product.
[00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:32.506]  Support the InfoWars.
[00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:33.807]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:34.468]  You're on the air.
[00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:35.008]  Thanks for rolling.
[00:29:35.008 --> 00:29:35.388]  Go ahead.
[00:29:35.388 --> 00:29:36.029]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:37.090]  It's great to be on with you.
[00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.851]  It's an honor.
[00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:38.111]  Honor.
[00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:38.672]  Talk to you.
[00:29:38.672 --> 00:29:39.052]  Awesome.
[00:29:39.572 --> 00:29:45.219]  Uh, so, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[00:29:45.219 --> 00:29:47.762]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:49.324]  Uh, and it helps in the bedroom.
[00:29:49.324 --> 00:29:51.987]  So, just number one for a few of the... Well, it definitely works.
[00:29:51.987 --> 00:29:53.609]  It's not a joke.
[00:29:53.609 --> 00:29:54.350]  Absolutely.
[00:29:59.205 --> 00:30:07.366]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:16.148]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:23.089]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:23.089 --> 00:30:25.710]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.150]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.750]  I think so.
[00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:56.399]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[00:30:56.399 --> 00:31:02.381]  They're 50% off right now at mfulmorestore.com.
[00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:12.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:12.984 --> 00:31:16.385]  I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
[00:31:21.998 --> 00:31:22.419]  We're good.
[00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.217]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:31:50.217 --> 00:31:54.879]  We've got somebody on the line that I really admire.
[00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:56.080]  It's going to be whistleblowers.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:06.726]  It's going to be insiders of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty that are going to bring down this global corporate tyranny that's trying to turn humanity against ourselves.
[00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:15.411]  David Johnson busted on the scene huge yesterday with Project Veritas and a big inside exposure of critical race theory being taught at Hasbro.
[00:32:17.122 --> 00:32:27.527]  Then he was on Sean Hannity last night laying it all out and I wanted to get him on to be able to at least have 20-30 minutes to talk about what he witnessed and what he saw.
[00:32:27.527 --> 00:32:34.051]  It doesn't matter if it's Lockheed Martin or the Rand Corporation or the Pentagon.
[00:32:34.051 --> 00:32:38.473]  All these weapons groups are pushing this because critical race theory is a weapon.
[00:32:38.473 --> 00:32:42.795]  It literally teaches people to not judge somebody off the character of them individually.
[00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:45.429]  Or their deeds, which is totally common sense.
[00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:47.129]  And Martin Luther King was absolutely right.
[00:32:47.129 --> 00:32:48.369]  That's why everybody bought into it.
[00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:50.310]  So everybody knows it's true.
[00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.571]  Versus judge somebody off of what color they are.
[00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.712]  And in fact, penalize people off of what color they are.
[00:32:56.712 --> 00:32:58.152]  That is a recipe of division.
[00:32:58.152 --> 00:33:02.673]  And you dig deeper into the UN and others, they want to divide the world and control it.
[00:33:02.673 --> 00:33:04.634]  So this is the opposite of unity.
[00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:05.934]  This is division.
[00:33:05.934 --> 00:33:07.634]  This is segregation.
[00:33:07.634 --> 00:33:09.415]  And this is true slavery.
[00:33:09.415 --> 00:33:09.615]  So,
[00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:27.966]  David Johnson decided to speak out against Critical Race Theory, being pushed by Hasbro, recognizing that CRT directly opposes the dream of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who died for it, who dreamt of a world where we would judge each other on our actions and character, not by the pigment of our skin, and that Critical Race Theory preaches
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:33.742]  We should treat each other as members of a racial group in order to be, quote, anti-racist.
[00:33:33.742 --> 00:33:35.103]  It's total gaslighting.
[00:33:35.103 --> 00:33:45.607]  They refuse to sit back as this harmful ideology is being pushed onto children, knowing that whistleblowers generally lose their jobs and sometimes have their identities attacked or defamed.
[00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:57.872]  That's why we need to support him now that they're suspending and probably going to lose his job, and so that others will step forward and we'll find a home for them and hire folks like Mr. Johnson, who has a conscience and has courage.
[00:33:58.596 --> 00:34:00.558]  GiveSendGo.com.
[00:34:00.558 --> 00:34:03.821]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash support David.
[00:34:03.821 --> 00:34:07.885]  And I know I'm going to make a $100 donation myself for his courage.
[00:34:07.885 --> 00:34:15.912]  There's been some developments now, and we're going to talk about what they've done, what they've said, because they don't want this information out because it's so damn racist.
[00:34:15.912 --> 00:34:18.695]  Thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[00:34:18.695 --> 00:34:19.936]  No, thank you for having me.
[00:34:19.936 --> 00:34:21.377]  My partner and I are big fans of you.
[00:34:21.377 --> 00:34:22.398]  Well, God bless you.
[00:34:24.022 --> 00:34:31.925]  I mean, you've got the floor here for the next 20 minutes, so just tell folks what you witnessed, what's happening, and why you spoke out.
[00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:32.785]  Sure.
[00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:47.671]  So, I'm an engineer at Hasbro, and one day they pulled me into a meeting for critical race theory and racial bias training in children, and when I saw it on my calendar, I'm like, I should probably record this, because
[00:34:49.128 --> 00:35:00.178]  I've seen critical race theory, intersectionality, wokeness, whatever you want to call it, spreading through our institutions and throughout our culture for the past few years.
[00:35:00.178 --> 00:35:14.151]  I didn't originally think the meeting was going to be too bad, but around two or three minutes in, they start saying things like, your three-year-old or your six-month-old is going to start exhibiting covert and
[00:35:16.638 --> 00:35:21.440]  And suffered racial biases against minorities, particularly the white children.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.562]  And when I saw that, I'm like, okay, this is huge.
[00:35:25.562 --> 00:35:30.264]  People need to know about this because Hasbro is not a small company.
[00:35:30.264 --> 00:35:38.407]  And if they're going to try to push this kind of indoctrination onto children, I felt that I had to say something.
[00:35:38.407 --> 00:35:40.648]  This is some evil stuff and you see right through it.
[00:35:40.648 --> 00:35:43.429]  I mean, from your own perspective, why was this so shocking to you?
[00:35:45.197 --> 00:36:06.335]  Just because it's neo-segregation, they're trying to tell people through CRT that they're going to make the world better somehow, but if you're going to teach children that they should judge people based on race first and foremost, then you're not going to make a world where there's less racism, you're not going to make a world where there's
[00:36:07.756 --> 00:36:08.816]  Less discrimination.
[00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:11.938]  You're just going to keep encouraging that kind of mindset into the future.
[00:36:11.938 --> 00:36:14.580]  And that's a no-brainer.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.861]  And so again, they're gaslighting us.
[00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:23.165]  Instead of everybody that opposed this critical race theory, like they had a space force getting fired, we need this out of our government, out of our institutions.
[00:36:23.165 --> 00:36:25.867]  They're the bad people doing this.
[00:36:25.867 --> 00:36:26.827]  Absolutely.
[00:36:26.827 --> 00:36:30.890]  The fact that it's in our government and then in our military is really scary to me.
[00:36:32.438 --> 00:36:44.910]  If they're going to push it on children, I figured that was the limit for me, because if they can indoctrinate an entire generation of children into believing that, then I don't know how America can come back from that.
[00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:51.657]  We've seen in the past, through history, what happens when these kinds of diversive ideologies are able to just
[00:36:52.478 --> 00:36:53.419]  Take hold of children.
[00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:57.663]  Um, that's how you get like the Hitler youth or the young Turks.
[00:36:57.663 --> 00:37:00.726]  Um, and we just, I don't want that in our country.
[00:37:00.726 --> 00:37:03.850]  I don't want my nieces and nephews to grow up thinking that that's right.
[00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:05.789]  Keep laying it out.
[00:37:05.789 --> 00:37:08.250]  You know the history better than others.
[00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.691]  Keep explaining to them why this is good.
[00:37:09.691 --> 00:37:16.053]  Because it's one thing to have a diverse country and we have an ethos of loving each other and having ideas and coming together.
[00:37:16.053 --> 00:37:17.134]  We can thrive.
[00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:21.416]  But if we're a diverse country with critical race theory taught, we will tear each other apart.
[00:37:21.416 --> 00:37:22.936]  So why would the Pentagon do that?
[00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:24.037]  To destroy the military.
[00:37:24.037 --> 00:37:24.817]  To destroy the country.
[00:37:26.836 --> 00:37:34.340]  Um, yeah, it seems to just be they want to sow division between people, um, based on things that don't matter, like race or by gender.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.461]  Um, we're all American.
[00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:39.983]  We just need to come together and just stand by the principles that our country was founded upon.
[00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:45.466]  That we shouldn't be judging people based on race or by their sex or whatever.
[00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:49.948]  We need to judge people based on their character, by the actions that they take.
[00:37:49.948 --> 00:37:53.149]  Um, that's progress in the truest sense.
[00:37:53.149 --> 00:37:54.570]  That's what Martin Luther King dreamed of.
[00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.091]  And that's, those are the values that I grew up with.
[00:37:57.038 --> 00:38:08.208]  Um, like, uh, one of my favorite quotes from a children's movie that, um, was, like, the biggest in my generation was, it's, the circumstances of your birth are irrelevant.
[00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:10.530]  It's what you do with life that determines who you are.
[00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.852]  And that's from, like, the early 90s.
[00:38:12.852 --> 00:38:15.434]  Um, so those are, those are where my values come from.
[00:38:16.782 --> 00:38:21.366]  This is such a reversal of the entire Christian-American ethos and what we were striving for.
[00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:27.752]  This is such an outrageously evil thing that they dress up as the wonderful thing we all better adopt.
[00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.513]  Yeah, it's a Trojan horse.
[00:38:31.513 --> 00:38:37.960]  They come to you and say, hey, we're going to teach you to be diverse and we're going to teach you how to be inclusive.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:45.249]  But what they're not saying is we're going to make sure that only our ideology is allowed and that ideology is discriminatory.
[00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:49.975]  What we want in diversity is diversity of thought.
[00:38:49.975 --> 00:38:52.016]  We want diversity of opinion.
[00:38:52.016 --> 00:39:04.922]  And even CRT, like, I want that to be out there so people know what it is, so people can speak out against it, so it can be criticized, and so people can understand why it's a bad idea.
[00:39:04.922 --> 00:39:05.362]  Absolutely.
[00:39:05.362 --> 00:39:06.022]  We're going to go to break.
[00:39:06.022 --> 00:39:07.143]  We've got a longer segment coming up.
[00:39:07.143 --> 00:39:07.783]  Let me ask you this.
[00:39:09.084 --> 00:39:15.873]  They've got pretty upset now and they're calling it an investigation and things that how dare you talk about what's going on this company.
[00:39:15.873 --> 00:39:18.296]  They should be proud of this but notice they're trying to sneak it through.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.823]  Yeah, really, they didn't want this to come to light.
[00:39:23.823 --> 00:39:41.174]  I've seen a lot of companies act the same way, because maybe on some level they know what they're doing is wrong, or they know that the general public will oppose them if they see it in its barest form, which is why they have to push it so covertly and push it through children.
[00:39:41.174 --> 00:39:45.657]  Exactly, they want to get it ubiquitously set up everywhere before we know what hit us.
[00:39:48.388 --> 00:39:50.570]  Yeah, that's the goal.
[00:39:50.570 --> 00:40:01.619]  They want it subvertly pushed so that by the time your children grow up that they're already going to be thinking in terms of race and thinking that people need to be segregated and thinking that's the right path.
[00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:03.380]  And it's not.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.082]  That's not what America's about.
[00:40:06.082 --> 00:40:16.731]  We should be embracing people to come together regardless of their skin color, regardless of what their background is, and we should just be judging people based on who they are through their actions and their character.
[00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:19.813]  Well, I like how in your statements you cut right to the chase.
[00:40:19.813 --> 00:40:21.454]  This is about divide and conquer.
[00:40:21.454 --> 00:40:25.197]  This is bigger than just trying to make white people guilty so they follow a Democrat agenda.
[00:40:25.197 --> 00:40:31.581]  This is really sick and evil, and it's actually going to create a lot of racism on different sides.
[00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:33.222]  People are going to rebel against this.
[00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:35.964]  This is going to empower racist groups on all different sides.
[00:40:35.964 --> 00:40:36.965]  It's horrible.
[00:40:36.965 --> 00:40:38.526]  It's poison like a cobra biting you.
[00:40:39.026 --> 00:40:40.828]  Very impressed with David Johnson.
[00:40:40.828 --> 00:40:43.370]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash support David.
[00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:52.878]  We want to celebrate these brave whistleblowers and put it on the line and support them and help get a new life started for being a defector from the brainwashers to America to warn us about what's happening.
[00:40:52.878 --> 00:40:56.040]  Literally a defector from these corporate brainwashing facilities.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.541]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:57.928 --> 00:41:01.610]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:10.176]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[00:41:11.121 --> 00:41:17.768]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:21.312]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[00:41:31.503 --> 00:41:32.524]  But that's it.
[00:41:32.524 --> 00:41:34.926]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[00:41:34.926 --> 00:41:37.148]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:41:37.148 --> 00:41:39.129]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.390]  It's the highest quality.

[00:41:55.922 --> 00:41:57.604]  So take action now while you still can.
[00:41:58.164 --> 00:42:01.907]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:42:01.907 --> 00:42:05.610]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.212]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck.
[00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:13.253]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:42:13.253 --> 00:42:19.018]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[00:42:19.018 --> 00:42:30.628]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:42:31.228 --> 00:42:33.369]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:37.491]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:48.096]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:42:48.096 --> 00:42:57.641]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:58.281]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:59.964 --> 00:43:08.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:08.475 --> 00:43:18.568]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:19.048 --> 00:43:21.972]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[00:43:21.972 --> 00:43:23.154]  Listen to this.
[00:43:23.154 --> 00:43:24.396]  Organic pea fiber.
[00:43:24.396 --> 00:43:25.858]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[00:43:25.858 --> 00:43:27.299]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[00:43:27.299 --> 00:43:28.761]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:30.163]  Organic kale leaf.
[00:43:30.163 --> 00:43:31.725]  Organic flax sprout.
[00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:33.328]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[00:43:33.328 --> 00:43:34.069]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:43:34.649 --> 00:43:36.770]  All of these things are so incredible for your health.
[00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:40.593]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[00:43:40.593 --> 00:43:45.355]  And we've packed it all in to Fiber Green Caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:45.355 --> 00:43:49.258]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[00:43:49.258 --> 00:43:51.439]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:54.280]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.801]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:01.204 --> 00:44:15.883]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:24.767]  Being given free will, being given consciousness, is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:41.415]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of a sunset, or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband, or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[00:44:41.415 --> 00:44:44.857]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[00:44:45.457 --> 00:44:53.845]  So don't worship the globalists, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the system, but worship the things of God, because we're made by God.
[00:44:53.845 --> 00:44:58.169]  And appreciate your consciousness, and appreciate free speech, while you still have it.
[00:44:58.169 --> 00:45:01.953]  While you still have it.
[00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:04.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:28.989 --> 00:45:34.853]  Alright, we are back now in the final segment of this hour.
[00:45:34.853 --> 00:45:37.115]  We have another incredible guest in studio.
[00:45:38.032 --> 00:45:41.333]  The first lady that Trump pardoned and got out of prison.
[00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:43.913]  She's going to be in studio with us.
[00:45:43.913 --> 00:45:47.574]  And she is really awake to the attack on the family and what's going on.
[00:45:47.574 --> 00:45:53.696]  So we look forward to that in the next hour in studio.
[00:45:53.696 --> 00:45:59.117]  We're going to have Angela Stanton King, then Robert Barnes.
[00:45:59.997 --> 00:46:03.498]  The lawyer has got some big news with Kyle Rittenhouse.
[00:46:03.498 --> 00:46:08.460]  And we've also got Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.941]  So look for that.
[00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:12.422]  Let me just say this.
[00:46:12.422 --> 00:46:15.803]  We're going to our guest.
[00:46:15.803 --> 00:46:26.827]  I've got COVID-19 news so bombshell that I'm not going to release it yet because I'm getting graphs together documents to show you this properly.
[00:46:26.827 --> 00:46:27.667]  But this is insane.
[00:46:28.678 --> 00:46:33.902]  And so I'll tell you about that either later today or on a special broadcast tonight.
[00:46:33.902 --> 00:46:45.349]  I was up here until 10 o'clock last night with this information, but I've confirmed what's in this lawsuit for the 45 or 43,000 dead the first few days from the vaccine and the cover up.
[00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:47.631]  And I've also got even more bombshell info.
[00:46:47.631 --> 00:46:57.357]  When you see Fauci and you hear the talking point on Fox News, even CNN saying 99% of people that are dying of COVID
[00:46:58.012 --> 00:46:59.694]  Are unvaccinated?
[00:46:59.694 --> 00:47:03.878]  I went and got the Israeli numbers, the British numbers, the UK numbers, the US numbers.
[00:47:03.878 --> 00:47:05.160]  It's a damn lie.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.463]  The majority are vaccinated.
[00:47:08.463 --> 00:47:10.906]  So when you read that headline, notice there's no proof in it.
[00:47:10.906 --> 00:47:12.567]  It's all a lie.
[00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:13.588]  I've got the actual numbers.
[00:47:13.588 --> 00:47:15.891]  So we're going to put all that together and put it out.
[00:47:15.891 --> 00:47:19.675]  Man, I mean, you know they're liars, but goodness gracious, going back to David Johnson,
[00:47:20.524 --> 00:47:26.377]  Again, he is a major Hasbro whistleblower on the critical, super hardcore critical race theory.
[00:47:26.377 --> 00:47:28.682]  I love how General Milley goes, well, they teach it at Harvard!
[00:47:30.008 --> 00:47:35.651]  So again, oh my goodness, you know, and Harvard also, you know, teaches that we should get rid of free speech.
[00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:37.191]  So let's do what Harvard says.
[00:47:37.191 --> 00:47:44.495]  Yale said that there's too many Asians with high test scores, but they have a low IQ for social behavior.
[00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:50.497]  I mean, just very stereotypical, insulting, what you call real racism.
[00:47:50.497 --> 00:47:52.358]  You know, my sister's Korean, adopted.
[00:47:52.358 --> 00:47:54.399]  She's got a lot of personality, probably more than me.
[00:47:54.943 --> 00:47:56.084]  I mean, that's very insulting.
[00:47:56.084 --> 00:48:00.687]  So, tell us the type of critical race theory, because there's different versions of it.
[00:48:00.687 --> 00:48:06.192]  I know you've released a lot of the documentation that they're teaching at Hasbro, and where do you see all this going?
[00:48:06.192 --> 00:48:07.252]  Sure.
[00:48:07.252 --> 00:48:12.676]  So, the one that they were presenting at Hasbro is like, I guess, the core critical race theory.
[00:48:12.676 --> 00:48:22.404]  It's the one where they teach people that those who possess whiteness are inherently oppressors, and those who lack whatever they qualify as whiteness are oppressed.
[00:48:25.058 --> 00:48:33.641]  That's kind of like the, probably the most mainstream interpretation of critical race theory, but there's other critical theories that are just as divisive that are out there.
[00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:46.025]  Critical gender theory is probably the second most common one, where they teach people that if you are male, that you're, again, the oppressor class, or if you're not that, then you are de facto the oppressed.
[00:48:46.025 --> 00:48:52.006]  But at Hasbro, it was just, I only experience critical race theory.
[00:48:52.006 --> 00:48:52.887]  When did this start?
[00:48:52.887 --> 00:48:53.607]  When did you first...
[00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:58.480]  Hearing that you were supposed to go through this.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:07.261]  Very shortly into my time at Hasbro, I just saw the meeting for Critical Race Theory on my calendar, and that was really the first time it came up.
[00:49:07.261 --> 00:49:23.024]  I've been aware that Hasbro has kind of done similar things based on Critical Race Theory before, like I think they have a, or not Critical Race Theory, but just Critical Theory, because they've done like Miss Monopoly before, which kind of pushes the tenets of Critical Gender Theory, arguably.
[00:49:23.684 --> 00:49:27.466]  But it seems like at Hasbro it's still in its early stages.
[00:49:27.466 --> 00:49:35.590]  The Conscious Kid is trying to push that they want their ideology to be considered at every level from product design to marketing to packaging.
[00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.611]  So it seems like it's still in its infancy there.
[00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:51.939]  But if it continues, we're probably going to see it go down the same routes that it has at other companies like Nickelodeon, for example, showing people, showing children the trans BLM parade as some kind of virtue signaling.
[00:49:52.299 --> 00:49:54.601]  That being Blue's Clues.
[00:49:54.601 --> 00:49:56.402]  Yeah, I'm Blue's Clues, of all things.
[00:49:56.402 --> 00:49:57.763]  That's something I grew up with.
[00:49:57.763 --> 00:50:04.749]  Instead of teaching them colors and numbers, they're teaching them, oh, you know, here's drag and LGBTQ, LMNOP, whatever.
[00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:09.967]  Well now, so many of the public schools, even private schools, don't teach reading, writing, arithmetic.
[00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:21.457]  They literally teach how to be divided, all this other weird stuff, which again, is going to create a tower, a babel, where no one identifies off what they produce and what they stand for.
[00:50:21.457 --> 00:50:27.363]  It'll all just be what group they're in, and that lets the leaders of those groups be like gang leaders and control everybody.
[00:50:29.577 --> 00:50:30.957]  It's absurd.
[00:50:30.957 --> 00:50:32.038]  Like, what is this?
[00:50:32.038 --> 00:50:35.158]  This is not something that children need to be exposed to.
[00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:42.159]  Children should just be able to play with toys and just focus on developing their fundamental skills, reading and understanding the world.
[00:50:42.159 --> 00:50:51.441]  They don't need all this divisive ideology to teach them to look at people differently and then rank them and treat them differently based on how they were born.
[00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:55.042]  It's just so absurd and it's really creepy.
[00:50:57.114 --> 00:51:01.715]  It's insanely creepy when you find out how many pedophiles, convicted pedophiles, are involved in it all.
[00:51:01.715 --> 00:51:05.656]  And then how many of the toys are sexual in nature.
[00:51:05.656 --> 00:51:07.016]  Especially what Target sells.
[00:51:07.016 --> 00:51:13.717]  Target, like, bombards children's books and don't even tell you that it's serious, hardcore sexual content.
[00:51:13.717 --> 00:51:15.778]  And then, of course, now it's not just drag queen story time.
[00:51:15.778 --> 00:51:17.838]  It's, uh, this is not a joke, folks.
[00:51:17.838 --> 00:51:22.599]  It is Rainbow Dildo, Butt Monkey, and the man has a fake
[00:51:23.323 --> 00:51:28.627]  Genitals hanging down, fake butt, and a women's breast, and the children are supposed to come sit in his lap.
[00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:32.330]  I mean, what alternate universe is this?
[00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:37.233]  Yeah, that was in the UK, I think, but it shows just how far that this has spread.
[00:51:37.233 --> 00:51:41.997]  It's not just an issue for America, it's an issue that the entire West is facing.
[00:51:41.997 --> 00:51:49.702]  Like, in what world is it acceptable to have someone with a dildo between their legs teaching children how to read?
[00:51:51.281 --> 00:51:52.782]  What point does that serve?
[00:51:52.782 --> 00:51:59.488]  It really just seems like they're just either trying to shock people or groom children or some strange mix.
[00:51:59.488 --> 00:52:01.429]  Oh, they even say, we're here to groom your children.
[00:52:01.429 --> 00:52:03.211]  We're here to have sex with them.
[00:52:03.211 --> 00:52:03.731]  Incredible.
[00:52:03.731 --> 00:52:10.516]  In closing, David Johnson, as this unfolds and as new stories come out, I'd love to have you on with your perspective.
[00:52:10.516 --> 00:52:17.562]  But the three minutes, four minutes we've got left, what else would you like to impart to the viewers and listeners about this covert war going on at the corporate level?
[00:52:19.879 --> 00:52:23.702]  I want people to pay attention, first and foremost.
[00:52:23.702 --> 00:52:34.112]  Pay attention to what your children or your nieces or your nephews or little siblings are being exposed to because it's not just a toy company.
[00:52:34.112 --> 00:52:36.774]  It's in their media like Nickelodeon.
[00:52:36.774 --> 00:52:37.635]  It's in their schools.
[00:52:38.716 --> 00:52:39.497]  It's everywhere.
[00:52:39.497 --> 00:52:43.479]  People really need to be paying attention and cognizant of that.
[00:52:43.479 --> 00:52:55.607]  And I want people to feel that coming out is very scary when you're speaking out against these big corporations, but you can do it too.
[00:52:55.607 --> 00:52:56.988]  Be brave.
[00:52:56.988 --> 00:52:58.409]  Reach out to Veritas.
[00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:01.551]  VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
[00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:03.612]  They've been helping me throughout this entire thing.
[00:53:03.612 --> 00:53:04.413]  They're really good people.
[00:53:05.254 --> 00:53:12.822]  Um, it just, we have to expose these creepy, divisive things that are spreading through our country.
[00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:13.824]  Powerfully said.
[00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:16.487]  Well, I tell ya, what work did you do at Hasbro?
[00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:32.322]  Packaging engineer, so I was responsible for the design of their, like the boxes and crates for how they display packaging in both retail and just online store.
[00:53:32.322 --> 00:53:38.608]  Wow, that's a pretty important job, so you were probably pretty well paid, so you gave up a lot to warn us.
[00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:41.752]  Um, I did.
[00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:44.434]  Um, my principles are not for sale.
[00:53:44.434 --> 00:53:51.099]  Um, I think this is more important than me or more important than the consequences that I may face.
[00:53:51.099 --> 00:53:51.699]  Powerful.
[00:53:51.699 --> 00:53:52.800]  Alright, people should support you.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.861]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash support.
[00:53:54.861 --> 00:53:57.483]  David, somebody ought to give this guy an engineering job.
[00:53:57.483 --> 00:53:59.565]  God bless you, sir.
[00:53:59.565 --> 00:53:59.885]  Thank you.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.081]  That's the kind of person I want working around here.
[00:54:02.081 --> 00:54:06.684]  By the way, for those who don't know, in toy manufacturing, they say the package is more important than the toy.
[00:54:06.684 --> 00:54:09.646]  That's one of the most important jobs there, and he gave that up.
[00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:13.048]  I imagine he's making a lot of money, but his morals are not for sale.
[00:54:13.048 --> 00:54:15.869]  And that's why we've got to support the independent market.
[00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:21.033]  The globalists want to shut that down and say, we're all not essential, so they can silence us.
[00:54:21.033 --> 00:54:24.014]  That's why we try to make it easy for you to support InfoWars.
[00:54:24.014 --> 00:54:25.775]  We have a new way to do it.
[00:54:25.775 --> 00:54:26.356]  We have a new
[00:54:27.219 --> 00:54:30.042]  Save the Frogs, Infowars.com coffee mug.
[00:54:30.042 --> 00:54:31.803]  The coffee mug costs us about $4.
[00:54:31.803 --> 00:54:37.609]  We're selling it for $9.95, and with the $5-$6 we make, that funds the operation.
[00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:38.950]  It's at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:44.054]  You can buy a second one for $4.95, almost at cost, when you get a second one to give as a gift.
[00:54:44.054 --> 00:54:46.517]  So, two coffee mugs for $14.95 or one for $9.95 at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:54:50.547 --> 00:54:52.527]  Save the Frogs Coffee Mug.
[00:54:52.527 --> 00:54:53.388]  It's a limited edition.
[00:54:53.388 --> 00:54:55.688]  We're going to run 10,000 of these.
[00:54:55.688 --> 00:54:59.449]  And then we're going to run 10,000 with a darker frog on there.
[00:54:59.449 --> 00:55:02.409]  So, I personally like the dark green frog, but this is a nice looking frog.
[00:55:02.409 --> 00:55:05.710]  And we have the frog t-shirts as well that are a best seller.
[00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:08.670]  Yeah, that's the one I really like, the darker green.
[00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:10.291]  Or the more electric green.
[00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.711]  Brighter green on the black's awesome.
[00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:13.031]  But I like the coffee mug as well.
[00:55:13.031 --> 00:55:16.032]  Not poo-pooing it, I'm just saying it's a limited edition coffee mug.
[00:55:16.032 --> 00:55:18.312]  And separately, I told you we'd spill out of the X2 Spray.
[00:55:18.992 --> 00:55:20.893]  At 60% off, it's almost sold out.
[00:55:20.893 --> 00:55:23.134]  It'll be sold out today.
[00:55:23.134 --> 00:55:27.696]  And we have the X2, very same X2 but dropper, for 40% off.
[00:55:27.696 --> 00:55:30.037]  It's the good halogen, and it funds the InfoWars.
[00:55:30.037 --> 00:55:31.878]  So please get all that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:55:31.878 --> 00:55:35.500]  I want to thank David Johnson again for coming on.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.741]  Please support him so others have the courage to step forward as well.
[00:55:38.741 --> 00:55:42.103]  It's the whistleblowers, I believe, are the Achilles heel of the globalists.
[00:55:42.103 --> 00:55:42.943]  We're all whistleblowers.
[00:55:42.943 --> 00:55:45.605]  We've got to blow the whistle on evil, and we have to stand up against it.
[00:55:45.605 --> 00:55:46.105]  We'll be right back.
[00:55:51.252 --> 00:55:52.533]  Jacob in Ohio.
[00:55:52.533 --> 00:55:52.913]  Welcome.
[00:55:52.913 --> 00:55:53.353]  Go ahead.
[00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:54.674]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:55:54.674 --> 00:55:55.235]  Good, Bob.
[00:55:55.235 --> 00:55:56.315]  Great last caller.
[00:55:56.315 --> 00:55:59.377]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[00:55:59.377 --> 00:56:05.101]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:06.662]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[00:56:07.102 --> 00:56:08.863]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[00:56:08.863 --> 00:56:09.803]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[00:56:09.803 --> 00:56:10.163]  Go ahead.
[00:56:10.163 --> 00:56:11.724]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:56:11.724 --> 00:56:14.745]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[00:56:14.745 --> 00:56:16.426]  The X2 does wonders.
[00:56:16.426 --> 00:56:17.547]  I recommend it to everybody.
[00:56:17.547 --> 00:56:18.747]  You're on the fence about it.
[00:56:18.747 --> 00:56:19.527]  Get off the fence.
[00:56:19.527 --> 00:56:20.208]  Get the product.
[00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:21.608]  Support the InfoWars.
[00:56:21.608 --> 00:56:22.909]  Tyler in Maine.
[00:56:22.909 --> 00:56:23.569]  You're on the air.
[00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:24.130]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.490]  Go ahead.
[00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.210]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.951]  It's an honor.
[00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:27.231]  Honor.
[00:56:27.231 --> 00:56:27.551]  Talk to you.
[00:56:27.771 --> 00:56:28.912]  Awesome.
[00:56:28.912 --> 00:56:34.336]  So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product Alpha Power even at 29.
[00:56:34.336 --> 00:56:38.440]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.001]  So just number one for a few weeks.
[00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.743]  Well it definitely works, just don't joke.
[00:56:42.743 --> 00:56:43.463]  Absolutely.
[00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:52.973]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[00:56:52.973 --> 00:57:01.541]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[00:57:02.469 --> 00:57:09.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[00:57:09.175 --> 00:57:12.679]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:15.101]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:20.406]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com, but only for one more week.
[00:57:20.406 --> 00:57:22.348]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[00:57:22.868 --> 00:57:23.889]  But that's it.
[00:57:23.889 --> 00:57:26.291]  They won't do the sale again until November.
[00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:28.493]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[00:57:28.493 --> 00:57:30.494]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:31.735]  It's the highest quality.
[00:57:31.735 --> 00:57:32.936]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[00:57:32.936 --> 00:57:34.637]  Three-month, six-month gear supplies.
[00:57:34.637 --> 00:57:41.063]  All ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:41.063 --> 00:57:43.264]  Again, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:43.264 --> 00:57:44.705]  10% off on high-quality, storable food.
[00:57:44.705 --> 00:57:45.506]  Ready to ship.
[00:57:45.506 --> 00:57:47.287]  But it ends in just one week.
[00:57:47.287 --> 00:57:48.969]  So take action now while you still can.
[00:57:51.926 --> 00:58:05.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:05.754 --> 00:58:17.161]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, and sits on the board of Iridium Satellite,
[00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:21.640]  He's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.822]  It has been lying dormant since the Patriot Act.
[00:58:24.822 --> 00:58:27.344]  These terrorists must be pursued.
[00:58:27.344 --> 00:58:28.385]  They must be defeated.
[00:58:28.385 --> 00:58:31.507]  And they must be brought to justice.
[00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:35.069]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:36.230]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.863]  It became clear during the Obama administration.
[00:58:40.863 --> 00:58:47.827]  President Barack Obama signed the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, despite threats that he might veto the bill.
[00:58:47.827 --> 00:58:56.673]  The 2012 version of the bill gave the military the power to arrest and hold people, including Americans, without charge and without the writ of habeas corpus.
[00:58:56.673 --> 00:58:58.234]  And now Washington, D.C.'
[00:58:58.214 --> 00:59:03.117]  's dirty little secret has been freed by a man of many secrets, Joe Biden.
[00:59:03.117 --> 00:59:05.538]  Americans are enemy number one.
[00:59:05.538 --> 00:59:06.759]  They weren't protesters.
[00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:10.014]  Don't dare call them protesters.
[00:59:10.014 --> 00:59:13.037]  They were a riotous mob.
[00:59:13.037 --> 00:59:14.859]  Insurrectionists.
[00:59:14.859 --> 00:59:16.961]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:59:16.961 --> 00:59:20.886]  The poison of racism has always existed in America.
[00:59:20.886 --> 00:59:24.410]  But over the past four years, it seems to have found new life.
[00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:38.054]  The FBI's view that top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.
[00:59:38.054 --> 00:59:51.619]  Those Americans opposing the views of the current administration and its legion of sycophantic power-hungry minions will be targeted in the name of misinformation or information that doesn't fit their narrative.
[00:59:51.619 --> 00:59:54.140]  For how long has the administration been spying
[00:59:56.743 --> 01:00:04.591]  Well, that was quite a loaded and inaccurate question, which I would refute.
[01:00:04.591 --> 01:00:14.062]  This is publicly open information, people sharing information online, just as you are all reporting information on your news stations.
[01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:25.111]  Okay, so these 12 people who you have on a list, 12 individuals, do they know that somebody at the Surgeon General's office is going through their profile?
[01:00:25.111 --> 01:00:27.973]  I'm happy to get you the citation of where that comes from.
[01:00:27.973 --> 01:00:29.854]  There's no secret list.
[01:00:29.854 --> 01:00:38.300]  I will tell you that these are people who are sharing information on public platforms on Facebook, information that is traveling, is inaccurate.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.522]  Our biggest concern here, and I frankly think it should be
[01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:48.648]  Your biggest concern is the number of people who are dying around the country because they're getting misinformation that is leading them to not take a vaccine.
[01:00:48.648 --> 01:00:56.214]  In a recent statement from the executive office titled, Fact Sheet, National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism,
[01:00:56.494 --> 01:01:08.283]  President Biden lays out a plan to enhance domestic terrorism analysis and improve information sharing throughout law enforcement at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels.
[01:01:08.283 --> 01:01:25.435]  Biden's statement goes on to designate the power of the federal government and Homeland Security to augment its efforts to address online terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence by domestic terrorists through increased information sharing with the technology sector.
[01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:27.096]  We're good to go.
[01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:50.308]  I'm good.
[01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:23.644]  Overreaching methods used to track down and prosecute an entire family that assumed they were protected by the First Amendment to voice a redress of their grievances after rampant reports of voter fraud and clear intimidation.
[01:02:23.644 --> 01:02:33.010]  Federal investigators say that they have multiple videos and social media messages that indicate the family traveled from Borger, a small town just north of Amarillo, all the way to Washington, D.C.
[01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:38.193]  According to documents in the court, a day after the riot, a Facebook post from the mother says, quote,
[01:02:38.733 --> 01:02:42.517]  I was just thinking, tear gas tastes like freedom.
[01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:45.961]  All five family members now face multiple federal charges.
[01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:51.948]  From the corruption of a government that has abandoned its oath of office, John Barham reporting.
[01:02:56.835 --> 01:03:05.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement edition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:05.363 --> 01:03:15.952]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:18.874]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[01:03:18.874 --> 01:03:19.455]  Listen to this.
[01:03:20.015 --> 01:03:21.276]  Organic pea fiber.

[01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:25.639]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:27.040]  Organic kale leaf.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.601]  Organic flax sprout.
[01:03:28.601 --> 01:03:30.203]  Organic quinoa sprout.

[01:03:33.645 --> 01:03:34.906]  Just one of these ingredients

[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.621]  Big Brother.
[01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:11.423]  Mainstream media.
[01:04:11.423 --> 01:04:12.504]  Government cover-ups.
[01:04:13.328 --> 01:04:15.010]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.671]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:16.671 --> 01:04:22.036]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:22.036 --> 01:04:25.959]  Well, I just met her five minutes ago, and I'll just say this.
[01:04:25.959 --> 01:04:30.863]  I don't invite most of my guests out for dinner, but I said, I gotta take this lady with my wife out to dinner.
[01:04:30.863 --> 01:04:32.525]  She's really interesting.
[01:04:33.399 --> 01:04:37.081]  I remember seeing her up on TV with Trump, hearing about her story.
[01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:42.164]  Five years in prison for something wrong with a car's title or something.
[01:04:42.164 --> 01:04:43.845]  I mean, they can put anybody they want in jail.
[01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:46.547]  Why are all these non-violent people in jail?
[01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.829]  Trump said, let non-violent people out.
[01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:54.812]  Angela Stanton King wrote a bestseller, number one national bestseller, about her story.
[01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:59.215]  And that helped get some of this criminal justice reform through then-President Trump.
[01:04:59.215 --> 01:05:00.816]  The Republicans basically got no credit for it.
[01:05:01.883 --> 01:05:03.724]  But then she was there on January 6th.
[01:05:03.724 --> 01:05:06.786]  She's got a new book out, Caught in the Coup.
[01:05:06.786 --> 01:05:09.147]  Angela Stanton King, national best-selling author.
[01:05:09.147 --> 01:05:10.008]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:05:10.008 --> 01:05:11.549]  So we have that shared experience.
[01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:14.291]  Then, she ran for Congress in Georgia.
[01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:17.553]  Saw the fraud for herself with the suitcases being pulled out.
[01:05:17.553 --> 01:05:19.834]  Now confirmed to be premeditated fraud.
[01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:23.156]  She was a witness to that, so she's like everywhere all the time.
[01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:25.138]  I kind of feel like the same way.
[01:05:25.138 --> 01:05:26.899]  I keep popping into these crazy things.
[01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:29.541]  Because when you're a man or woman in the arena, that's what happens.
[01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:35.405]  And she's also been massively censored with her millions of online followers she had taken away from her.
[01:05:35.405 --> 01:05:39.087]  AngelaStantonEPK.com.
[01:05:39.087 --> 01:05:40.488]  It's great to have you here.
[01:05:40.488 --> 01:05:42.009]  Oh man, thanks Alex.
[01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:44.031]  It's a blessing to be here on your show today.
[01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:44.871]  Where should we start?
[01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:45.992]  Because there's so much to get into.
[01:05:46.612 --> 01:05:47.593]  Oh, wow.
[01:05:47.593 --> 01:05:48.873]  There's a lot to get into.
[01:05:48.873 --> 01:05:50.094]  Well, you told me a lot in five minutes.
[01:05:50.094 --> 01:05:51.494]  Just repeat that to the viewers.
[01:05:51.494 --> 01:05:51.954]  Wow.
[01:05:51.954 --> 01:05:54.135]  I'm just going to kind of follow suit.
[01:05:54.135 --> 01:06:01.378]  You know, I was fortunate enough to be able to work with Trump and his administration by way of my godmother, Dr. Alveda King.
[01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:03.879]  Oh, I forgot that part.
[01:06:03.879 --> 01:06:04.600]  See, there's so much.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.845]  Yes, I actually met Alveda when I was released from prison and had nowhere to go.
[01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:22.561]  And this is kind of what made my switch from Democrat to Republican because here I am a convicted felon, I can't get any government assistance, I can't get any help, so I've got no choice but to get up off of my butt and create a lifestyle for myself.
[01:06:23.061 --> 01:06:31.746]  And so I ended up meeting her on that journey and then here we are years later in a Trump White House fighting for criminal justice reform and using my story.
[01:06:31.746 --> 01:06:39.010]  I ended up going to prison for title fraud and in that process I was pregnant and I know a lot of people don't like to get into it but I'll spill it.
[01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:42.032]  I gave birth to my daughter, chained to a bed.
[01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:47.775]  And so not only after that I was released and had to go through a lot in order to get my life back on track.
[01:06:47.775 --> 01:06:51.617]  So how I got involved was everybody was crying about family separation.
[01:06:52.297 --> 01:06:53.617]  Um, at the border.
[01:06:53.617 --> 01:06:55.718]  And I was saying, hey, wait a minute.
[01:06:55.718 --> 01:06:59.058]  Why is nobody talking about family separation in the border?
[01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:07.460]  Because I was an American citizen chained to a bed with a sheriff watching when they snatched my daughter out of my arms and separated our family.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.940]  And Trump was not president.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.400]  It was for a non-violent crime.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.481]  So I said, wait a minute.
[01:07:11.481 --> 01:07:13.781]  These people are full of crap.
[01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:18.202]  Trump said, hey, anybody that's interested in fighting for criminal justice reform, I'm here.
[01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:18.642]  I'll listen.
[01:07:19.182 --> 01:07:30.569]  I went in and told my story, was very, very instrumental in helping to pass the First Step Act, and the President also made it illegal for them to chain women to bed during childbirth because of my story.
[01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:34.031]  And he ended the cages down at the border that Obama had, but they still blame him.
[01:07:34.031 --> 01:07:41.256]  Still blame him for it, and forgot all about the kids in cages in juvenile detention centers across this nation, so to me it seemed like it was just
[01:07:41.796 --> 01:07:43.296]  All about jokes, you know?
[01:07:43.296 --> 01:07:46.157]  So I ended up getting a full pardon from the President.
[01:07:46.157 --> 01:07:50.919]  After getting a full pardon from the President, I ran for office because I wanted to make a difference.
[01:07:50.919 --> 01:07:52.759]  I wanted to use my story.
[01:07:52.759 --> 01:07:57.020]  All the Democrats are always talking about Black Lives Matter and the impact of black life.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.301]  I said, well, wait a minute.
[01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.761]  You know, I'm from the hood.
[01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:00.741]  I was born in the hood.
[01:08:00.741 --> 01:08:03.702]  Everything that they're talking about, I've been able to overcome.
[01:08:03.702 --> 01:08:05.282]  So let me jump in this race.
[01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:09.444]  I ran for John Lewis's seat down there in Fulton County in Georgia's 5th District.
[01:08:09.444 --> 01:08:10.784]  Not only was our President cheated,
[01:08:11.204 --> 01:08:11.985]  But I was cheated.
[01:08:11.985 --> 01:08:13.906]  My campaign was completely suppressed.
[01:08:13.906 --> 01:08:15.827]  The media was completely biased.
[01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:22.351]  They wouldn't even allow me to promote or advertise any of my campaign videos through my social media.
[01:08:22.351 --> 01:08:26.294]  And now nearly 1 million followers completely deleted.
[01:08:26.294 --> 01:08:32.518]  Twitter, Instagram, backup Instagram account and Facebook all gone.
[01:08:32.518 --> 01:08:38.062]  And all that success and all the speeches and all the fame you weren't looking for built that for them
[01:08:38.817 --> 01:08:40.138]  And then they just steal it from you.
[01:08:40.138 --> 01:08:41.098]  That's theft.
[01:08:41.098 --> 01:08:42.479]  And that's exactly what they do.
[01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:51.123]  They try to make it seem as if they've done the work, but they've been floating in the back community like that for a very long time, and it's time for us to wake up.
[01:08:51.123 --> 01:08:52.283]  Like I said, where to start?
[01:08:52.283 --> 01:08:56.345]  The whole point about Martin Luther King, what would he say about critical race theory?
[01:08:56.345 --> 01:09:00.407]  To me, that looks like it's 180 degrees the opposite of what your
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:10.788]  I tell you what, the same daughter that I gave birth to, chained to a bed, just won the International Championship for the Harvard Debate Council.
[01:09:10.788 --> 01:09:12.109]  Made history.
[01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:13.370]  This is two days ago.
[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:17.734]  She did that because her mother told her that she could be anything that she wanted to be.
[01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:17.834]  Wow.
[01:09:17.834 --> 01:09:18.855]  That there are no limits.
[01:09:18.855 --> 01:09:29.524]  So had I allowed someone to teach my daughter that someone was better than her or that she would never make it, or if I took on that mindset myself, I would have never made it from the prison
[01:09:29.984 --> 01:09:30.165]  Wow!
[01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:35.096]  So what would your ancestor Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:09:35.096 --> 01:09:35.497]  say today?
[01:09:40.641 --> 01:09:44.444]  Um, I don't think that he would agree at all with what's going on.
[01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:51.109]  And this is actually my godmother, Alveda King is the niece, but I don't think that he would agree at all with what's going on.
[01:09:51.109 --> 01:09:52.310]  It's not what he stood for.
[01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:59.615]  I mean, to me, when I look into some of these policies and I look into what Black Lives Matter stands for, and I know that it's actually against black life,
[01:10:00.055 --> 01:10:05.339]  I mean, his complete agenda is totally against even the creation of black life.
[01:10:05.339 --> 01:10:08.961]  These are the same people that are on the front lines of abortion.
[01:10:08.961 --> 01:10:14.265]  So how can you say black lives matter and not recognize the fact that black life begins in the womb?
[01:10:14.265 --> 01:10:15.366]  We have to wake up.
[01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:17.577]  And then look at Black Lives Matter.
[01:10:17.577 --> 01:10:19.499]  I mean, I look at these Antifa events and everything.
[01:10:19.499 --> 01:10:30.832]  It's all 90% white academics dressed up in black, and then they're in black neighborhoods trying to stir up a riot so they can literally use black people to burn down the country and then blame black people.
[01:10:30.832 --> 01:10:31.993]  I mean, it's pure evil.
[01:10:32.233 --> 01:10:37.837]  I mean, it reminds me so much of some of the things that were witnessed in the past with the KKK.
[01:10:37.837 --> 01:10:40.939]  I mean, why are they not burning down the influential white communities?
[01:10:40.939 --> 01:10:50.546]  They're coming in our communities, burning down the businesses that we own, completely destroying property and saying that they're doing it to save us, but nobody has come back to rebuild.
[01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:54.809]  These communities are still completely destroyed, and I don't see the benefit of it.
[01:10:54.809 --> 01:10:54.969]  I don't
[01:10:55.009 --> 01:11:04.753]  I don't see anything that Joe Biden has done since, you know, there are a lot of black Democrats in office and black women like Stacey Abrams that want to take credit for putting Joe Biden in office.
[01:11:04.753 --> 01:11:07.574]  What has Joe Biden done to enhance black life?
[01:11:07.574 --> 01:11:17.017]  The only thing I've seen Joe Biden do is sign the Equality Act, which totally, totally, totally puts our children in harm's way.
[01:11:17.017 --> 01:11:17.897]  Amazing.
[01:11:17.897 --> 01:11:19.058]  I could listen to you all day.
[01:11:19.058 --> 01:11:20.598]  We still got about 45 minutes left.
[01:11:20.598 --> 01:11:21.739]  We're gonna go to break in about three minutes.
[01:11:22.982 --> 01:11:24.404]  What order then do you want to go through things?
[01:11:24.404 --> 01:11:25.626]  What happened at the Capitol?
[01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:27.488]  How you watched them steal the election in Georgia?
[01:11:27.488 --> 01:11:28.609]  Not just Trump's, but your own?
[01:11:28.609 --> 01:11:31.813]  I mean, there's so much to get into.
[01:11:31.813 --> 01:11:36.940]  We probably should start with what happened in the election and then go to January 6th, because I think it all led up to that.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.420]  Let's do that.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:37.821]  Let's do that.
[01:11:38.447 --> 01:11:39.428]  Start getting into it.
[01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:48.116]  So, again, with the campaign that I ran in Georgia for John Lewis's seat, I mean complete, complete, absolute media bias.
[01:11:48.116 --> 01:11:53.702]  The woman that was hand-selected, Nekima Williams, by the Democrat, written in, refused to debate.
[01:11:54.202 --> 01:11:59.966]  I mean, there were more than 50 attempts to debate with this woman and she would not debate at one time.
[01:11:59.966 --> 01:12:08.573]  Let alone that she somehow managed to get more votes than John Lewis ever got in the history of his career and no one had ever heard of her.
[01:12:08.573 --> 01:12:10.314]  She's not even an Atlanta native.
[01:12:10.314 --> 01:12:11.835]  She's from Alabama.
[01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:13.976]  I'm watching the election take place.
[01:12:13.976 --> 01:12:15.017]  I'm looking at the counts.
[01:12:15.017 --> 01:12:16.678]  I'm seeing them stop the vote.
[01:12:16.678 --> 01:12:17.439]  They're saying, hey,
[01:12:17.759 --> 01:12:19.179]  Water mainly now, no didn't break.
[01:12:19.179 --> 01:12:21.540]  Guys, show the footage of them grabbing the suitcases out.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:28.821]  On the same day that they're having the election, in the same room, that somehow holds the ballots.
[01:12:28.821 --> 01:12:32.962]  I said, wait a minute, something here isn't right.
[01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:40.303]  After that, we saw plenty of video surface with Ruby Harris and her daughter, who was their supervisor, and I guess her assistant.
[01:12:40.303 --> 01:12:43.083]  We saw suitcases being pulled out from up under tables.
[01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:45.184]  We saw ballots being run through twice.
[01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:45.864]  Not only that,
[01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:57.451]  Not only was I a candidate in that race, not only is my name on every ballot that Donald Trump's name is on, we also witnessed Republicans being locked out of counting centers.
[01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:58.532]  Covering the windows up.
[01:12:58.532 --> 01:13:04.256]  We saw board members locked in the windows where they weren't even allowed to see them count.
[01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:10.842]  Somehow, there's also videos of ballots being dropped off in the middle of the night.
[01:13:10.842 --> 01:13:12.363]  And we're not supposed to ask questions about that.
[01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:14.691]  Why can't I ask questions?
[01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:18.332]  Stacey Abrams cried about being cheated by Governor Kemp.
[01:13:18.332 --> 01:13:19.852]  She's still crying about it.
[01:13:19.852 --> 01:13:24.553]  Why can't we ask questions without having our social media accounts suspended and banned?
[01:13:24.553 --> 01:13:25.293]  Let's talk about that.
[01:13:25.293 --> 01:13:31.175]  In fact, guys, reprint me or pull me the new national terrorism directed by Biden.
[01:13:31.175 --> 01:13:31.895]  I want to show her this.
[01:13:31.895 --> 01:13:33.815]  You're so informed, you probably already know about it.
[01:13:33.815 --> 01:13:38.356]  Did you know they've declared anybody who questions the election fraud a white supremacist?
[01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.675]  I'm so white, I don't know what to do.
[01:13:41.675 --> 01:13:44.538]  Every time I get in the morning, I see this white skin.
[01:13:44.538 --> 01:13:45.899]  I just don't know what to do.
[01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:48.162]  And you didn't like your election being stolen to your white supremacist.
[01:13:48.162 --> 01:13:49.443]  We're going to show that when we come back.
[01:13:49.443 --> 01:13:51.765]  This is crazy, but it's happened.
[01:13:51.765 --> 01:13:52.245]  Stay with us.
[01:13:52.245 --> 01:13:53.747]  They're stealing our whole country right now.
[01:13:53.747 --> 01:13:58.691]  A bunch of foreign banks.
[01:13:58.691 --> 01:13:59.953]  Your voice counts.
[01:14:00.763 --> 01:14:05.806]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:14:05.806 --> 01:14:08.387]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:14:08.387 --> 01:14:09.908]  They know you're angry.
[01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:15.290]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[01:14:56.662 --> 01:15:04.849]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[01:15:04.849 --> 01:15:13.615]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[01:15:13.615 --> 01:15:20.561]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:15:26.045 --> 01:15:26.585]  I think?
[01:15:45.871 --> 01:15:53.779]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.

[01:16:34.227 --> 01:16:34.447]  Yes.
[01:16:34.887 --> 01:16:39.831]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.

[01:16:46.616 --> 01:16:47.797]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:16:47.797 --> 01:16:49.658]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:16:49.658 --> 01:16:52.460]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:59.646]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:16:59.646 --> 01:17:02.328]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:33.667]  Angela Stanton King is our guest best-selling author and she helped get prison reform through.
[01:17:35.546 --> 01:17:39.309]  And then she ran for Congress right there in Georgia and saw it stolen right there.
[01:17:39.309 --> 01:17:40.250]  Well, Trump got robbed.
[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.251]  All that news is coming out.
[01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:44.673]  And then that leads to the Capitol, you were saying, and what happened there.
[01:17:44.673 --> 01:17:45.454]  But you hit the brake.
[01:17:45.454 --> 01:17:48.876]  You were still talking about what happened in Georgia, what you witnessed.
[01:17:48.876 --> 01:17:51.718]  Now they have to admit there was fraud, where they've done spot checks.
[01:17:51.718 --> 01:17:54.260]  Oh, my gosh, 10,000, 20,000 ballots for Trump.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.721]  Clearly it was stolen from them.
[01:17:55.721 --> 01:18:00.605]  But then how does it get reinstated when the whole political class doesn't want President Trump back?
[01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:06.812]  Um, you know, I think that there's just a group of powerful people that don't want President Trump.
[01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:10.073]  I think the majority of America wants President Trump back.
[01:18:10.073 --> 01:18:12.933]  And I say that because I was there to witness.
[01:18:12.933 --> 01:18:15.314]  I've been at several of his rallies.
[01:18:15.314 --> 01:18:18.495]  You know, I've ridden, you know, in private jets with Mike Liddell.
[01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:25.056]  I was with Herman Cain at the rally in Tulsa where they say that he caught COVID and unfortunately, you know, lost his life.
[01:18:25.056 --> 01:18:27.937]  And I've seen the support that this president has.
[01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.157]  And I know that since
[01:18:29.517 --> 01:18:31.598]  You know, Joe Biden has gotten in office.
[01:18:31.598 --> 01:18:37.079]  A lot of eyes have been open, but back to January 6th, I was there, Alex, and so were you.
[01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:42.800]  And I never heard the president tell anyone to storm the Capitol.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:50.242]  I've heard the president speak very peacefully and calmly about what his expectations were and how we could support each other.
[01:18:50.242 --> 01:18:55.323]  But, you know, I have heard the Democrats tell people to burn things down, get in their faces.
[01:18:55.743 --> 01:18:59.048]  Right, to make sure you attack them, to run up on them.
[01:18:59.048 --> 01:19:01.552]  We'll burn everything down if we don't get what we want.
[01:19:01.552 --> 01:19:05.137]  Whoever said protests are peaceful, that's Cuomo on CNN.
[01:19:05.137 --> 01:19:06.600]  Hey, listen.
[01:19:07.273 --> 01:19:16.841]  They're playing us all for fools, and now we've got this big whole January 6th insurrection, but didn't a couple of the Democrats get locked up for storming the Capitol the other day?
[01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:23.066]  Absolutely, and now they're holding 500 people, most of which didn't even hit anybody, in solitary confinement.
[01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:23.887]  Since when does that happen?
[01:19:23.887 --> 01:19:25.408]  They let carjackers out in a week now.
[01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:26.509]  In a week.
[01:19:26.509 --> 01:19:27.910]  And let me tell you something.
[01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:30.892]  I was there on January 6th and I was on my way.
[01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:34.415]  I was riding in a golf cart and I had security take me up to the front.
[01:19:34.415 --> 01:19:37.098]  And when I got there, I had a really bad feeling.
[01:19:37.098 --> 01:19:42.642]  I saw some people there that I had never seen at any of the president's rallies before.
[01:19:42.642 --> 01:19:45.585]  And I knew that they were all about trouble.
[01:19:45.585 --> 01:19:50.589]  I turned around and there's a video of me leaving just because I had a bad feeling.
[01:19:50.589 --> 01:19:51.470]  I had a horrible feeling too.
[01:19:51.890 --> 01:20:02.454]  It just the energy wasn't right and I mean I was at the president's RNC speech as well and also at the National Prayer Breakfast but even at the RNC speech that night where we were all attacked by Black Lives Matter.
[01:20:02.454 --> 01:20:07.196]  I was on the inside of the White House and it was such a peaceful atmosphere.
[01:20:07.196 --> 01:20:09.137]  The moment we walked outside of the gate
[01:20:09.637 --> 01:20:13.862]  It was almost as if you walked into hell right there.
[01:20:13.862 --> 01:20:15.885]  That was the time Rand Paul got attacked, right?
[01:20:15.885 --> 01:20:17.487]  That was, I was, I was right there.
[01:20:17.487 --> 01:20:19.529]  And I'm like, these people are attacking Rand Paul.
[01:20:19.529 --> 01:20:20.631]  They were saying, say her name.
[01:20:20.631 --> 01:20:29.021]  He was the, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he,
[01:20:29.597 --> 01:20:31.078]  To end the no-knock warrants.
[01:20:31.078 --> 01:20:34.079]  And they're attacking him using her name.
[01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:38.000]  And it's all because they're strictly driven by racism.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.182]  Anybody that... Well, it shows exactly how it's upside-down world.
[01:20:41.182 --> 01:20:43.082]  Upside-down world.
[01:20:43.082 --> 01:20:51.406]  And now we're out here not only fighting against this stereotype that somehow racism is all of a sudden on the rise, but what's going on with our children?
[01:20:51.406 --> 01:20:56.688]  I think that racism is just a distraction for what's happening with... Man, I wish you would have got into Congress.
[01:20:56.688 --> 01:20:57.568]  I wish they wouldn't have stole it.
[01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:04.235]  How many other amazing folks are you like out there that people are suppressing of every race, color, and creed or humans?
[01:21:04.235 --> 01:21:22.792]  Listen, they're gonna make sure they suppress people like me because I'm also the one that was down at the Palace Bar in Miami and caught those kids on stage at one o'clock at night in a place where I was made to show my identification because adults were in there drinking, smoking, and having strip teases
[01:21:23.252 --> 01:21:26.297]  And then here are seven and nine-year-old little girls.
[01:21:26.297 --> 01:21:27.218]  Shoes too big.
[01:21:27.218 --> 01:21:35.850]  We're going to cover this next segment, but you're one of these people that is so engaged everywhere that I just, everything you keep showing me, I go, you're that lady, you're that lady, you're that lady?
[01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:36.691]  Wow!
[01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:38.614]  I keep saying, like, what else are you up to?
[01:21:39.801 --> 01:21:41.282]  We've got to fight this fight.
[01:21:41.282 --> 01:21:44.885]  Well, I know you told my producer, I said, what does she want to get into mainly?
[01:21:44.885 --> 01:21:47.487]  She said, well, she's really pissed off about transgender stuff.
[01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:49.608]  So we'll we'll spend the rest of the interview if you want on that.
[01:21:49.608 --> 01:21:50.128]  We come back.
[01:21:50.128 --> 01:21:54.652]  But getting back to the Capitol, watching that a million people showed up.
[01:21:54.652 --> 01:21:55.852]  It was peaceful.
[01:21:55.852 --> 01:21:58.054]  Maybe a few thousand got rowdy with the cops.
[01:21:58.054 --> 01:21:59.495]  Maybe 600 went in.
[01:21:59.495 --> 01:22:01.877]  They're calling this worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11.
[01:22:01.877 --> 01:22:02.477]  That is horrible.
[01:22:02.757 --> 01:22:05.118]  I think that is really horrible that they're doing that.
[01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:15.201]  And I mean hey, after what we saw Black Lives Matter do, I've watched Black Lives Matter literally not only destroy the city of Atlanta, Minneapolis, I mean all throughout the United States be violent.
[01:22:15.201 --> 01:22:16.861]  People have lost their lives.
[01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:19.142]  Millions and millions of property damaged.
[01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:20.883]  Downtown buildings spray-painted.
[01:22:20.883 --> 01:22:21.763]  I mean complete
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:23.441]  Destitute!
[01:22:23.441 --> 01:22:34.853]  I mean just the whole Wendy's in Atlanta, Georgia that was burned down is just completely gone and riding by there and just thinking about some of the things that have happened and took place and nobody has come back to rebuild and they're going to say that January 6th was bad?
[01:22:34.853 --> 01:22:36.936]  I just want to say I really like your energy.
[01:22:36.936 --> 01:22:44.504]  Hey, all I know is the people that were at the Capitol on January 6th weren't the people coming into the black communities burning our communities down and that's all I got to say.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:51.924]  If America was in a football game right now, globalist versus American, who really is winning right now?
[01:22:51.924 --> 01:22:54.466]  Because I see them stealing the election, doing all this.
[01:22:54.466 --> 01:22:58.728]  Yeah, they think they're in charge right now, and I see it backfiring big on them.
[01:22:58.728 --> 01:23:03.131]  It's definitely going to backfire big on them because people are getting fed up, and guess what?
[01:23:03.131 --> 01:23:04.332]  Americans are joining forces.
[01:23:04.332 --> 01:23:05.473]  They're saying, hey, wait a minute.
[01:23:05.473 --> 01:23:06.934]  This isn't right.
[01:23:06.934 --> 01:23:09.996]  Trump was, you know, the year 2020 was just that.
[01:23:09.996 --> 01:23:11.577]  It gave us 2020 vision.
[01:23:11.577 --> 01:23:12.718]  Trump opened our eyes, and
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.566]  We're getting ready to fight this thing, and we're not going out silent, and we ain't going out like no punks either.
[01:23:19.566 --> 01:23:22.588]  Well, I think that's what really panicked the Democrats was the demographics.
[01:23:22.588 --> 01:23:28.353]  You had almost 40% of black males voting for Republicans under Trump, almost a tripling.
[01:23:28.353 --> 01:23:30.435]  You had double black females voting for him.
[01:23:30.435 --> 01:23:36.200]  If that continued and then Trump delivered on the economy and unifying, that'd be game over for the race pimp Democrats.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.622]  Hey, listen, I was right there in Atlanta.
[01:23:38.622 --> 01:23:44.787]  Trump rolled out his $500 billion platinum plan that was specifically for the black community.
[01:23:44.787 --> 01:23:45.527]  What did we do?
[01:23:45.527 --> 01:23:51.993]  We watched Joe Biden on with Charlamagne Tha God saying, hey, if you don't vote for me, then you ain't black.
[01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.494]  And what did black people do?
[01:23:53.494 --> 01:23:57.837]  Have to prove the color of their skin like he didn't already know it.
[01:23:57.837 --> 01:24:02.061]  I think that we may be missing our own opportunities because we're misled.
[01:24:02.641 --> 01:24:03.962]  Well it's so condescending.
[01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:10.665]  I mean if somebody told me you're not a Christian unless you do what I say or you're not you're not what I mean it's like he owns somebody.
[01:24:10.665 --> 01:24:14.307]  Somebody told me you better do this you're not who you are I'd say shut the hell up.
[01:24:14.307 --> 01:24:15.748]  I mean who the hell is this guy?
[01:24:15.748 --> 01:24:16.729]  It's so horrible.
[01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:17.469]  It's so bad.
[01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.110]  I mean I can just see planes today.
[01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:24.233]  I mean one call we could get a meeting with President Trump get in discuss issues going on in the black community.
[01:24:24.233 --> 01:24:28.435]  Right now you still got Black Lives Matter, Ice Cube, all of these organizations saying hey
[01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:30.056]  Joe Biden, what about us?
[01:24:30.056 --> 01:24:33.118]  We see that there's been $50 million for the Asian community.
[01:24:33.118 --> 01:24:37.041]  We see that there's been a stop, Kate, against the Asian Americans.
[01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:43.886]  But if you got in off of the people that say black lives matter, where is anything that you're doing for black life?
[01:24:43.886 --> 01:24:44.747]  That was like Obama.
[01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.709]  Remember, he wouldn't even go speak at a black group.
[01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:49.730]  He wouldn't even, why did he run away from black people?
[01:24:49.730 --> 01:25:00.595]  Not only that, but took away the funding from our HBCUs and also banned funding for our faith-based HBCUs, which Donald Trump actually put back in place.
[01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.896]  So, thank you Mr. Trump for that.
[01:25:02.896 --> 01:25:06.458]  But why did, because it was even pointed out by the black community, everybody.
[01:25:07.262 --> 01:25:09.343]  Obama ran from the black community.
[01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:15.706]  Listen, Obama was all about transitioning our children, changing our sexes, and aborting our babies.
[01:25:15.706 --> 01:25:17.607]  And that's just the bondage to God's truth.
[01:25:17.607 --> 01:25:21.109]  I mean, we gotta stop voting just because of someone's skin color.
[01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:23.590]  That doesn't mean that that's what's best for you.
[01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:24.490]  And that goes back to what?
[01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.651]  Common sense.
[01:25:25.651 --> 01:25:27.732]  Common sense.
[01:25:27.732 --> 01:25:29.533]  Wow, I'm impressed.
[01:25:29.533 --> 01:25:30.073]  The new book,
[01:25:31.098 --> 01:25:39.282]  I know your other was the number one best-seller, but this is Caught in the Coup, Angela Stanton King, and you can find this in bookstores, on your website, where's the best place?
[01:25:39.282 --> 01:25:40.422]  Yep, you can find it everywhere.
[01:25:40.422 --> 01:25:43.504]  AngelaStantonEPK.com will take you straight to it.
[01:25:43.504 --> 01:25:50.767]  Well, we're going to come back and get into their big move against our children, children of every color, the Transgender Depopulation Agenda.
[01:25:50.767 --> 01:25:52.308]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:25:55.163 --> 01:25:58.845]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[01:25:58.845 --> 01:26:07.411]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[01:26:08.343 --> 01:26:15.029]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.
[01:26:15.029 --> 01:26:18.552]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[01:26:18.552 --> 01:26:20.974]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:26:20.974 --> 01:26:26.279]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com, but only for one more week.
[01:26:26.279 --> 01:26:28.221]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[01:26:28.741 --> 01:26:29.761]  But that's it.
[01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:34.363]  They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:36.364]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:26:36.364 --> 01:26:37.624]  It's the highest quality.
[01:26:37.624 --> 01:26:46.928]  Hundreds of high-quality foods, three-month, six-month year supplies, all ready for you at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[01:26:55.131 --> 01:26:57.879]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[01:26:59.398 --> 01:27:00.518]  And I just want to say something.
[01:27:00.518 --> 01:27:06.680]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.220]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.121]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:27:13.121 --> 01:27:16.462]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:27:16.462 --> 01:27:17.682]  You've got red blood.
[01:27:17.682 --> 01:27:23.843]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[01:27:23.843 --> 01:27:27.464]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:27:28.164 --> 01:27:32.027]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:27:32.027 --> 01:27:34.910]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:40.534]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:27:40.534 --> 01:27:42.395]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:27:42.395 --> 01:27:46.839]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:27:46.839 --> 01:27:50.942]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:27:50.942 --> 01:27:53.924]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for us.
[01:27:53.924 --> 01:27:54.285]  God bless.
[01:27:58.511 --> 01:27:59.753]  Jacob in Ohio.
[01:27:59.753 --> 01:28:00.133]  Welcome.
[01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:00.573]  Go ahead.
[01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:01.895]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:28:01.895 --> 01:28:02.455]  Good, brother.
[01:28:02.455 --> 01:28:03.536]  Great last caller.
[01:28:03.536 --> 01:28:06.599]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[01:28:06.599 --> 01:28:12.305]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[01:28:12.305 --> 01:28:14.047]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[01:28:14.047 --> 01:28:14.848]  All right.
[01:28:14.848 --> 01:28:16.109]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:17.050]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:17.210]  Go ahead.
[01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:18.951]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:21.973]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[01:28:21.973 --> 01:28:23.635]  The X Team does wonders.
[01:28:23.635 --> 01:28:24.795]  I recommend it to everybody.
[01:28:24.795 --> 01:28:26.757]  If you're on the fence about it, get off the fence.
[01:28:26.757 --> 01:28:27.637]  Get the product.
[01:28:27.637 --> 01:28:28.838]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:28:28.838 --> 01:28:30.139]  Tyler in Maine.
[01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:30.800]  You're on the air.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.360]  Thanks for rolling.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:31.700]  Go ahead.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.422]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[01:28:33.422 --> 01:28:34.162]  It's an honor.
[01:28:34.162 --> 01:28:34.442]  Honor.
[01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:35.003]  Talk to you.
[01:28:35.003 --> 01:28:35.383]  Awesome.
[01:28:35.923 --> 01:28:41.568]  Uh, so, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[01:28:41.568 --> 01:28:45.671]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, uh, and it helps in the bedroom.
[01:28:45.671 --> 01:28:48.313]  So, just number one for a few... Well, it definitely works.
[01:28:48.313 --> 01:28:49.955]  It's not a joke, you know?
[01:28:49.955 --> 01:28:57.701]  Absolutely.
[01:28:57.701 --> 01:29:00.323]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:06.621 --> 01:29:14.045]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[01:29:14.045 --> 01:29:19.729]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:25.272]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:28.874]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[01:29:28.874 --> 01:29:33.537]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[01:29:33.797 --> 01:29:36.179]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[01:29:36.179 --> 01:29:38.241]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[01:29:38.241 --> 01:29:43.205]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate.
[01:29:43.205 --> 01:29:46.308]  We'll convert your children.
[01:29:46.308 --> 01:29:50.071]  Someone's gotta teach them not to hate.
[01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:52.032]  We're coming for them.
[01:29:52.032 --> 01:29:55.275]  We're a bunch of dudes dressed up like women.
[01:29:55.275 --> 01:29:57.237]  We're gonna get your kids, we're so evil.
[01:29:57.237 --> 01:29:59.138]  We're coming for them.
[01:29:59.138 --> 01:30:01.540]  We're coming for them.
[01:30:08.602 --> 01:30:13.828]  Some of these guys are registered pedophiles, it turns out.
[01:30:37.325 --> 01:30:38.266]  Total cult.
[01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:43.829]  So a man trying to talk to a child about sex in the park, they go to jail.
[01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:46.471]  But now they bring him into the schools.
[01:30:46.471 --> 01:30:47.431]  They set him on their lap.
[01:31:06.693 --> 01:31:31.845]  We'll convert your children Then we'll turn to you Giving up the purest, lightest dream Like you never knew Go and see San Francisco Go and turn up that disco You'll forget you were ever upset We'll convert your children And make a hell of a
[01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:35.062]  We'll get your kids.
[01:31:35.062 --> 01:31:36.503]  We'll corrupt your children.
[01:31:36.503 --> 01:31:39.847]  Had a foul agenda.
[01:31:39.847 --> 01:31:42.890]  Now you're locked in your house.
[01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:46.573]  You can't call your incumbent past.
[01:31:46.573 --> 01:31:48.595]  I'm just gonna rape you with that.
[01:31:48.595 --> 01:31:55.922]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[01:31:57.322 --> 01:32:02.529]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[01:32:02.529 --> 01:32:04.972]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[01:32:04.972 --> 01:32:06.514]  We can both be groomed.
[01:32:06.514 --> 01:32:09.879]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[01:32:09.879 --> 01:32:11.782]  Family programming!
[01:32:12.562 --> 01:32:23.106]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:32:23.106 --> 01:32:31.829]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[01:32:31.829 --> 01:32:35.090]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:38.212]  This is Satya Balina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[01:32:38.212 --> 01:32:40.693]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[01:32:40.693 --> 01:32:41.814]  A stardom young, right?
[01:32:41.814 --> 01:32:43.315]  A stardom young, right?
[01:32:44.344 --> 01:32:47.027]  So all of this is funded by the IMF and World Bank.
[01:32:47.027 --> 01:32:53.153]  Klaus Schwab came out two weeks ago and said, we need more sexual training for homosexuality with the children.
[01:32:53.153 --> 01:32:54.934]  That's so people don't have children.
[01:32:54.934 --> 01:32:56.136]  So this is depopulation.
[01:32:56.136 --> 01:33:00.620]  Angela Stanton King, you again helped get prison reform in this country.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.283]  They say you're the catalyst, your book, number one bestseller.
[01:33:03.283 --> 01:33:05.525]  Trump gives it credit for getting that done.
[01:33:06.505 --> 01:33:09.186]  And so, you know, you've got a lot of power.
[01:33:09.186 --> 01:33:10.287]  I mean, you've got some energy.
[01:33:10.287 --> 01:33:11.927]  You're able to get things done.
[01:33:11.927 --> 01:33:15.109]  People who can get things done are the ones who do it over and over again.
[01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:18.230]  And so you were telling us off air that your next big fight is this.
[01:33:18.230 --> 01:33:19.190]  That's where God led you.
[01:33:19.190 --> 01:33:19.990]  Explain.
[01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:22.611]  You weren't in some bar to see kids dance.
[01:33:22.611 --> 01:33:23.772]  You were on the beach in Miami.
[01:33:23.772 --> 01:33:24.972]  You heard a bunch of music.
[01:33:24.972 --> 01:33:26.073]  You went to see what it was.
[01:33:26.073 --> 01:33:28.154]  We're going to play the video here in a moment.
[01:33:28.154 --> 01:33:33.536]  But now this is your, I mean, just another big fight of the heart you've got going here as a mother.
[01:33:33.536 --> 01:33:34.336]  Tell us what you witnessed.
[01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:38.800]  Um, well, first of all, when I got to the club, it was already 11.40 at night.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.063]  I was asked, stopped at the front to show my ID to make sure that I was old enough to enter.
[01:33:43.063 --> 01:33:44.805]  I go inside, I have to show my ID.
[01:33:44.805 --> 01:33:45.385]  I sit down.
[01:33:45.385 --> 01:33:46.986]  I'm with a bunch of other adults.
[01:33:46.986 --> 01:33:47.887]  Everyone's drinking.
[01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:49.448]  They're all smoking hookah.
[01:33:49.448 --> 01:33:54.413]  We're watching this gentleman that we see on the screen with the blonde hair perform with two other men.
[01:33:54.413 --> 01:33:58.916]  They're having a half-naked sex orgy right on stage.
[01:33:58.916 --> 01:34:02.960]  Not only that, the one with the blonde hair with the two girls was getting dry humped in the mouth.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:08.744]  After that scene was over, he went to the back, come back out, and I see the two little girls.
[01:34:08.744 --> 01:34:10.005]  I'm like, hold on, wait a minute.
[01:34:10.005 --> 01:34:16.309]  I'm instantly uncomfortable because now I feel like I'm contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
[01:34:16.309 --> 01:34:16.710]  Damn right.
[01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:26.477]  There is no reason why children should be allowed to be in this type of adult environment where these sexually explicit things are taking place.
[01:34:26.477 --> 01:34:28.558]  So, of course, I take out my video.
[01:34:28.558 --> 01:34:29.779]  I start recording.
[01:34:29.779 --> 01:34:31.180]  I also call the manager over.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.621]  And tell him how inappropriate it is.
[01:34:33.621 --> 01:34:43.026]  Next thing I know, they run an article on the news saying that, hey, I'm responsible for all of the death threats that their club is getting, and all I'm doing is attacking their establishment.
[01:34:43.026 --> 01:34:47.688]  What I'm saying is, you can't take a child into a female strip club.
[01:34:47.688 --> 01:34:50.269]  You can't take them into Magic City or Atlanta.
[01:34:50.269 --> 01:34:57.693]  So why is it okay to see men, half-naked, stripping for money, and allowing children to stare that same stare?
[01:34:57.693 --> 01:35:00.154]  And men yelling sexual things at the children.
[01:35:00.154 --> 01:35:00.794]  We've had to believe that.
[01:35:00.794 --> 01:35:00.894]  Yeah.
[01:35:31.034 --> 01:35:31.895]  This is my thing.
[01:35:31.895 --> 01:35:38.878]  When we are dealing with children and as an adult, if you want to make a decision to say, hey, this is how I want to live my life, that's one thing.
[01:35:38.878 --> 01:35:39.538]  I 100% agree.
[01:35:39.538 --> 01:35:41.119]  Leave the children alone.
[01:35:41.119 --> 01:35:42.500]  And that is where we're at.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.041]  We're talking about this attack that are on the minds of our children.
[01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:56.186]  And the reason why this is so important to me is because I know if someone hadn't made my son believe somewhere along the lines that he could be a woman transitioning, we wouldn't even be
[01:35:56.246 --> 01:35:59.571]  And that's where this is going without even telling parents all over the world.
[01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:02.495]  Big corporations are funding this to go confuse children.
[01:36:02.495 --> 01:36:08.905]  Now they're saying half of autistic boys worldwide are now becoming transgender because they can make them fixate and brainwash them.
[01:36:09.688 --> 01:36:11.910]  Not only that, let's talk about what this really means.
[01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:20.175]  I mean, I remember a few years ago seeing a big movement in the community where everybody was talking about, let's stop the genital mutilation of young girls over in Africa.
[01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:22.697]  Transgenderism is genital mutilation.
[01:36:22.697 --> 01:36:24.318]  It's dismemberment, right?
[01:36:24.318 --> 01:36:26.819]  They first do it with chemicals and then they physically cut it off.
[01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:27.680]  Exactly.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.601]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:29.601 --> 01:36:32.283]  And I mean, if you cut it off, I mean, how is it going to work?
[01:36:32.283 --> 01:36:35.385]  This all leads down to, just like you said, depopulation.
[01:36:35.385 --> 01:36:36.506]  They even have girls.
[01:36:37.393 --> 01:36:39.876]  Having their breasts removed because they think they're a boy.
[01:36:39.876 --> 01:36:44.221]  This is training a woman, a little girl, to cut her breast off.
[01:36:44.221 --> 01:36:47.644]  I mean, if you cut your hand off 50 years ago, they put you in a mental institution.
[01:36:47.644 --> 01:36:49.766]  If you cut your penis off, they put you in a mental institution.
[01:36:49.766 --> 01:36:51.048]  Now they tell you you're great.
[01:36:51.048 --> 01:36:52.329]  This is so serious.
[01:36:52.329 --> 01:36:55.773]  This is such an attack on life because how are you going to feed your baby?
[01:36:56.798 --> 01:36:59.920]  Your breasts are there for a reason.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.941]  This all goes back... It's a satanic ritual.
[01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:03.041]  It absolutely is.
[01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:04.782]  So is the child's sacrifice.
[01:37:04.782 --> 01:37:06.223]  So hey, we can get into that.
[01:37:06.223 --> 01:37:06.663]  Abortion?
[01:37:06.663 --> 01:37:06.963]  No, hit him.
[01:37:06.963 --> 01:37:07.843]  Tell him the truth.
[01:37:07.843 --> 01:37:09.204]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[01:37:09.204 --> 01:37:14.026]  Planned Parenthood is a racist organization brought and grounded in eugenics.
[01:37:14.026 --> 01:37:15.107]  They've... Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:37:16.150 --> 01:37:19.331]  My doctor, who I haven't seen in a year, I'm supposed to have an appointment.
[01:37:19.331 --> 01:37:20.571]  I missed my appointment.
[01:37:20.571 --> 01:37:21.951]  So they said, I only got one at two o'clock.
[01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:23.211]  I got to go to it today.
[01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:27.912]  How would you like to take a break in about 30 minutes, but come back and host 30 minutes of the show?
[01:37:27.912 --> 01:37:28.693]  Hey, we can do that.
[01:37:28.693 --> 01:37:29.133]  Why not?
[01:37:29.133 --> 01:37:30.573]  Owen's great, but Owen's OK.
[01:37:30.573 --> 01:37:31.433]  Owen's not going to do it.
[01:37:31.433 --> 01:37:31.813]  He's great.
[01:37:31.813 --> 01:37:32.633]  He's got his 3 p.m.
[01:37:32.633 --> 01:37:33.213]  show.
[01:37:33.213 --> 01:37:36.914]  We'll tell Owen he can relax at 1.30.
[01:37:36.914 --> 01:37:42.035]  She's going to come in here and she's going to host the last 30 minutes of my show before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:37:42.035 --> 01:37:44.136]  But we've still got a segment and a half left.
[01:37:44.136 --> 01:37:44.856]  OK.
[01:37:44.856 --> 01:37:45.716]  Keep telling them what's going on.
[01:37:46.804 --> 01:37:49.786]  Back to this transgender agenda that we're talking about.
[01:37:49.786 --> 01:37:51.928]  This is a direct attack on life.
[01:37:51.928 --> 01:37:56.973]  And even with Planned Parenthood, this is an admitted racist organization, right?
[01:37:56.973 --> 01:37:59.755]  Where they specifically targeted the black community.
[01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:01.797]  The 75%, over 75% of their abortion clinics
[01:38:04.179 --> 01:38:05.880]  Are in black communities.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.761]  They're telling us abortion is healthcare.
[01:38:07.761 --> 01:38:14.385]  Not only that, on October 31st of 2017, Planned Parenthood put up a tweet.
[01:38:14.385 --> 01:38:21.970]  It said that black women in America are statistically safer aborting their children than they are giving birth.
[01:38:22.603 --> 01:38:25.204]  We should be offended, but you don't see that.
[01:38:25.204 --> 01:38:35.107]  You see people like Stacey Abrams and Tamika Mallory, the people that are at the head of these movements saying black lives matter, but also telling our women that abortion is healthcare.
[01:38:35.107 --> 01:38:39.509]  Listen, 46% of the black population has already been aborted.
[01:38:39.509 --> 01:38:41.129]  Let's talk about these agendas.
[01:38:41.129 --> 01:38:46.791]  Abortion, transgenderism, mass incarceration, maybe even the shot.
[01:38:47.572 --> 01:38:53.097]  All of these things seem to be an attack on black life, but we keep voting for the people that are actually against us.
[01:38:53.097 --> 01:38:54.679]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:57.361]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena.
[01:38:57.361 --> 01:38:59.383]  A man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart.
[01:38:59.383 --> 01:39:03.387]  People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right.
[01:39:03.387 --> 01:39:09.492]  The audits are coming out and there was total, absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[01:39:09.492 --> 01:39:09.933]  That is
[01:39:10.533 --> 01:39:11.873]  The bottom line.
[01:39:11.873 --> 01:39:17.875]  And Mike Lindell is getting sued by all these big powerful globalist institutions trying to shut him down.
[01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:26.538]  That's why it's so important to support MyFellow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America.
[01:39:26.538 --> 01:39:28.758]  Because he's doing God's work.
[01:39:28.758 --> 01:39:31.019]  And at the same time, he's funding InfoWars.
[01:39:31.019 --> 01:39:31.539]  That's right.
[01:39:31.539 --> 01:39:33.640]  When you use promo code ALEX at checkout,
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.844]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:18.909]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeover is trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:40:18.909 --> 01:40:19.749]  Worse than slaves.
[01:40:19.749 --> 01:40:23.711]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:30.534]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:40:31.235 --> 01:40:41.264]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia, and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:40:41.264 --> 01:40:45.447]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:40:45.447 --> 01:40:47.649]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:40:47.649 --> 01:40:49.911]  Freedom or slavery, good or evil.
[01:40:49.911 --> 01:40:52.894]  It is a spiritual battle, and M4 War is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:40:55.237 --> 01:41:07.270]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:14.038]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[01:41:14.338 --> 01:41:21.544]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[01:41:21.544 --> 01:41:26.368]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[01:41:26.368 --> 01:41:28.310]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:37.657]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[01:41:37.657 --> 01:41:42.121]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.

[01:41:52.745 --> 01:41:54.086]  TheBiopros.com.
[01:41:55.146 --> 01:42:03.649]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:13.753]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:14.233 --> 01:42:17.154]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[01:42:17.154 --> 01:42:18.335]  Listen to this.
[01:42:18.335 --> 01:42:19.576]  Organic pea fiber.
[01:42:19.576 --> 01:42:21.036]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[01:42:21.036 --> 01:42:22.477]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[01:42:22.477 --> 01:42:23.937]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.358]  Organic kale leaf.
[01:42:25.358 --> 01:42:26.899]  Organic flax sprout.
[01:42:26.899 --> 01:42:28.520]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.240]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.942]  All of these things are so incredible for your health.
[01:42:31.942 --> 01:42:35.786]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[01:42:35.786 --> 01:42:40.550]  And we packed it all in to Fiber Green Caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:44.453]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.635]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[01:42:46.635 --> 01:42:49.478]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[01:42:49.478 --> 01:42:50.999]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:58.721 --> 01:43:01.323]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:36.349 --> 01:43:40.452]  Angela Stanton King is our guest, and she is an impressive lady.
[01:43:40.452 --> 01:43:44.194]  My text messages are filling up from friends and family, and they don't really do that very often.
[01:43:44.194 --> 01:43:59.725]  This is a great interview, but I mean, I just feel good, truthful energy from you, and we've had a lot of the same experiences, and you've helped get major reform done, and your own son, basically you're saying, you know, you love him, you're not attacking him, but had this put in his mind as the thing to do, and now it's everywhere.
[01:43:59.725 --> 01:44:03.207]  They're bombarding our children with it, and
[01:44:04.125 --> 01:44:15.662]  So you've got the floor here and you're going to come back in the last 30 minutes of the next hour and you're going to host the show today as well, ahead of Paul Watson, about how serious this is and where this is going and what you think we should do.
[01:44:16.337 --> 01:44:29.567]  Man, something has to be done and for one we need to get us some real freedom fighters in Congress and I don't think that that's going to happen for us until of course we can clean up what's going on with these Dominion machines and get this election fraud cleaned up.
[01:44:29.567 --> 01:44:41.877]  But I think honestly, I mean with all the work that I've been able to do for this administration and with this administration and the things that my eyes have been opened up to, I never really thought that any of this was about racism or COVID.
[01:44:41.877 --> 01:44:45.380]  I've always thought that this was a cover-up for human trafficking and pedophilia.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:53.343]  And it seems as the days play out that these things are becoming more and more relevant as we go along here.
[01:44:53.343 --> 01:45:02.386]  Not only with the agenda that I see by the media pushed on me and how I was attacked basically of being accused of misgendering my own son.
[01:45:02.386 --> 01:45:03.786]  I've got the birth certificate.
[01:45:03.786 --> 01:45:04.486]  I filled it out.
[01:45:04.486 --> 01:45:06.047]  I know what the doctors told me.
[01:45:06.047 --> 01:45:06.387]  I know
[01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:17.495]  Who and what I've raised and I think that this spirit of confusion that they are forcing on our children is wrong and we have to have some strong people that are willing to stand up against it.
[01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:21.697]  It's gotten so bad that even at We Spa not too long ago,
[01:45:22.541 --> 01:45:23.622]  Ladies were in the jacuzzi.
[01:45:23.622 --> 01:45:25.863]  They were on their side of the spa.
[01:45:25.863 --> 01:45:30.466]  A man comes in and says, hey, I identify as... A white guy with a big beard and a big penis.
[01:45:30.466 --> 01:45:33.207]  Listen, and two big balls, okay?
[01:45:33.207 --> 01:45:40.191]  Gets inside of the jacuzzi tub, not only with adult women, but a 9-year-old child and a 14-year-old child as well.
[01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:41.272]  All of these women get up.
[01:45:41.272 --> 01:45:42.392]  They run to the front.
[01:45:42.392 --> 01:45:44.093]  They say, hey, we're demanding our money back.
[01:45:44.093 --> 01:45:45.374]  What about our rights?
[01:45:45.374 --> 01:45:47.155]  And they're saying, by law, we can't do anything.
[01:45:47.555 --> 01:45:50.498]  We can't discriminate against gender identity.
[01:45:50.498 --> 01:45:51.439]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:45:51.439 --> 01:45:55.443]  Okay, if you identify as a woman, why do you still have man parts?
[01:45:55.443 --> 01:45:57.545]  Where is the common sense?
[01:45:57.545 --> 01:46:01.209]  There used to be a thing called indecent exposure, right?
[01:46:01.209 --> 01:46:05.553]  Where you just couldn't expose yourself in front of a group of people.
[01:46:05.553 --> 01:46:09.157]  The laws that have been passed since this new administration has been in office
[01:46:09.657 --> 01:46:11.760]  Put our children in harm's way.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:20.672]  I sat and watched Keisha Bottoms sign an executive order allowing men to go into women's bathroom and I'm thinking to myself, hey, wait a minute.
[01:46:20.672 --> 01:46:22.795]  I've raised a daughter in the house with three boys.
[01:46:23.587 --> 01:46:26.708]  Never once have they ever had to be in the bathroom together.
[01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:31.050]  Never have my sons ever exposed themselves to my daughter.
[01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:37.052]  But now if she goes to school, or she goes to the airport, or she goes to a restaurant, she has to be exposed to a bathroom.
[01:46:37.052 --> 01:46:37.712]  Well, exactly.
[01:46:37.712 --> 01:46:40.634]  My own daughters never sat there and saw me do that.
[01:46:40.634 --> 01:46:43.034]  And I always left them when they were getting dressed after they were about three.
[01:46:43.034 --> 01:46:45.655]  I mean, the idea of this is sick.
[01:46:45.655 --> 01:46:48.076]  And it's like, oh, we're the ones to corrupt your children.
[01:46:48.076 --> 01:46:50.117]  We're the ones that are going to teach them.
[01:46:50.117 --> 01:46:50.998]  This is out of control.
[01:46:50.998 --> 01:46:52.098]  And by the way, look at this evil.
[01:46:52.578 --> 01:46:56.781]  Ontario woman charged after allegedly sexually assaulting a boy.
[01:46:56.781 --> 01:47:02.325]  They said this little boy got raped in a park, it's a big old gross man, and they say a woman did it.
[01:47:02.325 --> 01:47:08.070]  That'd be like, again, I mean this is just so ridiculous to say that's a woman.
[01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:13.534]  And now they're letting men take over all the sports, track, weightlifting, everything, from the women!
[01:47:13.534 --> 01:47:14.294]  What a cult!
[01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.495]  What a sick cult!
[01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:19.098]  A bunch of pedophiles are literally taking over women's spaces.
[01:47:19.398 --> 01:47:28.261]  And this is what I want to say, like to me I had to really sit down because I went back to school and I got my bachelor's degree in psychology because I wanted to understand my son's experience.
[01:47:28.261 --> 01:47:36.064]  And what I learned was that when it comes to LBGTQ and all of those letters, all of those letters represent a sexuality.
[01:47:36.064 --> 01:47:39.305]  When did we begin to tie children with sex?
[01:47:39.305 --> 01:47:42.086]  So if you think about the L letter... Well that goes back to Margaret Sanger.
[01:47:42.086 --> 01:47:46.587]  They said make it all about the health department and your gender and then we control you to sterilize you.
[01:47:46.807 --> 01:47:50.249]  And so isn't that, doesn't it seem like all of this stuff is tied together?
[01:47:50.249 --> 01:47:53.670]  Somehow the Black Lives Matter movement, we find out that this is a farce.
[01:47:53.670 --> 01:48:02.414]  This is actually about a queer affirming network that wants to totally disrupt, right, the Western prescribed nuclear family that was stated on their own website.
[01:48:02.414 --> 01:48:05.395]  This is a biological transhumanist revolution.
[01:48:05.395 --> 01:48:11.938]  That's exactly what it is because the founder of Black Lives Matter is married to a white trans man.
[01:48:11.938 --> 01:48:14.439]  Black America, you need to wake up.
[01:48:16.736 --> 01:48:17.938]  What it is, is a revolution.
[01:48:17.938 --> 01:48:19.980]  Because if you take over people's biology, you've conquered them.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:29.613]  Just like Monsanto said in a court case 20-something years ago in the South Africa, they were getting sued over this GMO product they had that the farmers couldn't make seeds that grew out of it.
[01:48:29.613 --> 01:48:31.836]  And they said, listen, our real goal is to have humans like this.
[01:48:32.529 --> 01:48:34.711]  Where we've got to be maiden test tubes.
[01:48:34.711 --> 01:48:38.674]  I mean, they want to end men and women coming together and that power of families.
[01:48:38.674 --> 01:48:38.914]  Period.
[01:48:38.914 --> 01:48:39.815]  Because that's everything.
[01:48:39.815 --> 01:48:43.018]  Hey, not only is it revolutionary, this thing is also spiritual.
[01:48:43.018 --> 01:48:43.318]  Okay?
[01:48:43.318 --> 01:48:48.802]  Because if you're confused and don't know who you are, it's very important that you know your identity.
[01:48:48.802 --> 01:48:53.046]  If you're confused and don't know who you are, then you can believe that you're anyone.
[01:48:53.046 --> 01:48:55.828]  If you don't have a name and I say A, you'll respond.
[01:48:55.828 --> 01:48:57.610]  If I say B, you'll respond.
[01:48:57.610 --> 01:48:59.151]  We need to make sure that our children
[01:48:59.651 --> 01:49:04.474]  Know who they are, and that we are not supporting agendas that end our lifelines.
[01:49:04.474 --> 01:49:05.475]  What about your bloodline?
[01:49:05.475 --> 01:49:06.756]  Are you voting now?
[01:49:06.756 --> 01:49:09.938]  Oh, absolutely, and that's how you conquer people, is ending their bloodline.
[01:49:09.938 --> 01:49:12.659]  You just cut right to the chase.
[01:49:12.659 --> 01:49:15.261]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[01:49:15.261 --> 01:49:22.145]  And what about everybody getting on board thinking, oh, this is like, this is like not being racist, or now, now we're not having a gender.
[01:49:22.145 --> 01:49:24.527]  They've just signed on to the most scientific evil ever.
[01:49:25.342 --> 01:49:25.822]  Ever.
[01:49:25.822 --> 01:49:26.863]  And this ends life.
[01:49:26.863 --> 01:49:28.003]  It doesn't create life.
[01:49:28.003 --> 01:49:33.986]  And with the black population already being so low, we're only 13% of the population.
[01:49:33.986 --> 01:49:35.287]  Joe Biden said it.
[01:49:35.287 --> 01:49:42.411]  He had a viral interview that went viral where he was talking to black community leaders and he said, hey, America is doomed.
[01:49:42.411 --> 01:49:45.652]  He said not just because of African-Americans, but because by 2040,
[01:49:47.453 --> 01:49:49.535]  Then white people will be the minority.
[01:50:17.653 --> 01:50:19.455]  And I'm a former felon, right?
[01:50:19.455 --> 01:50:21.637]  Thank you, President Trump, for giving me a full pardon.
[01:50:21.637 --> 01:50:28.583]  But if we know the difference between an American citizen and an American criminal, then damn it, you need to know the difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant.
[01:50:28.583 --> 01:50:29.603]  Well, no, I totally agree.
[01:50:29.603 --> 01:50:32.005]  But all I'm saying is they want to play us all up against each other.
[01:50:32.005 --> 01:50:32.506]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:32.506 --> 01:50:34.247]  In fact, here's Senator Dick Durbin.
[01:50:34.247 --> 01:50:34.808]  We'll play the clip.
[01:50:35.348 --> 01:50:37.351]  White people are being demographically replaced.
[01:50:37.351 --> 01:50:38.712]  GOP is doomed.
[01:50:38.712 --> 01:50:40.955]  So the GOP is the party that ended slavery.
[01:50:40.955 --> 01:50:43.137]  The GOP is the party that passed the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:50:43.137 --> 01:50:47.843]  The GOP is the party that Wilt Chamberlain and Martin Luther King were in.
[01:50:47.843 --> 01:50:51.207]  But then they brainwashed everybody to follow the KKK Democrat.
[01:50:51.207 --> 01:50:54.291]  And now here they are again, the Robert Byrd Senators.
[01:50:54.751 --> 01:51:02.374]  KKK Grand Cyclops literally saying, hey minorities you better be with us, we're going to get the white people.
[01:51:02.374 --> 01:51:05.395]  Which is then going to make white people become racist and get in a racial group.
[01:51:05.395 --> 01:51:08.136]  The way you control a prison is putting people in racial groups.
[01:51:08.136 --> 01:51:09.917]  They're turning us into a prison.
[01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:13.398]  I'll tell you what, the GOP supported me.
[01:51:13.398 --> 01:51:20.160]  Not only did they support me, they supported my campaign while Democrats were telling people that I was a racist and that I was a white supremacist.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:24.982]  And my message was that I wanted black Americans to give life to their children.
[01:51:24.982 --> 01:51:27.502]  I wanted us to make sure that our men become men.
[01:51:27.502 --> 01:51:31.784]  So the white supremacist doesn't want to kill black people and wants men to be men.
[01:51:31.784 --> 01:51:32.584]  How dare you?
[01:51:32.584 --> 01:51:33.544]  You're so evil.
[01:51:33.544 --> 01:51:33.964]  Absolutely.
[01:51:33.964 --> 01:51:36.045]  So here's Dick Durbin, race pimp, globalist.
[01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:40.367]  Here he is saying, again, we're going to get rid of the white people, this is a good thing.
[01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:45.950]  Which again is going to make white people then see black people as the enemy when it's these people manipulating us against each other.
[01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:47.991]  Here it is.
[01:51:47.991 --> 01:51:58.076]  In response to the minority leader's statement about the changes in voting laws across America, the record speaks for itself.
[01:51:58.076 --> 01:52:00.977]  I believe the number is 17.
[01:52:00.977 --> 01:52:04.399]  17 states controlled by the Republicans in the legislature
[01:52:05.126 --> 01:52:12.612]  Which you've set out to specifically limit previous opportunities under law to vote.
[01:52:12.612 --> 01:52:14.074]  Coincidence?
[01:52:14.074 --> 01:52:17.176]  That 17 states would do these things?
[01:52:17.176 --> 01:52:18.838]  I don't think so.
[01:52:18.838 --> 01:52:21.120]  I think it's by design.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.662]  That's why the Senate Rules Committee was in charge of today.
[01:52:24.514 --> 01:52:28.236]  To talk specifically about the measures that they took.
[01:52:28.236 --> 01:52:30.097]  Let's stop right there because this is a longer clip.
[01:52:30.097 --> 01:52:33.218]  I guess I'd mentioned I wanted to cut this down to just him saying that.
[01:52:33.218 --> 01:52:34.239]  So let's try to do that right now.
[01:52:34.239 --> 01:52:36.220]  I want to come back in the next segment and play that.
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:40.182]  But again, all the facts are record numbers of quote minorities are voting Republican.
[01:52:40.182 --> 01:52:41.482]  That's why the Democrats are so panicked.
[01:52:41.482 --> 01:52:43.183]  I'm going to give you a chance to respond to that.
[01:52:43.183 --> 01:52:45.264]  We'll give you a 20 minute break after that.
[01:52:45.264 --> 01:52:47.345]  And then you're going to come back and you're going to host.
[01:52:47.345 --> 01:52:49.186]  And then I'm going to come back today after my doctor's appointment.
[01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:54.188]  I'll be back sometime once the war room starts because there's a lot to cover and I've got some huge news.
[01:52:54.188 --> 01:52:55.189]  Separately, I barely plugged today.
[01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:56.790]  We won't be here on air unless you support us.
[01:53:07.017 --> 01:53:14.662]  We've got new Save the Frogs, Infowars.com, coffee mugs for $9.95, get a second one for $4.95.
[01:53:14.662 --> 01:53:19.064]  These mugs cost us like four bucks to make, so we've got to sell a lot of those to fund this operation.
[01:53:19.064 --> 01:53:21.986]  We also have X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine in the
[01:53:22.666 --> 01:53:24.388]  Spray bottle.
[01:53:24.388 --> 01:53:26.130]  The sale ends today because it's about to sell out.
[01:53:26.130 --> 01:53:28.372]  It will sell out by the end of the day.
[01:53:28.372 --> 01:53:30.714]  It's 60% off and we have the dropper bottle, same iodine.
[01:53:30.714 --> 01:53:32.135]  So good for your body, the missing link.
[01:53:32.135 --> 01:53:38.201]  I'm talking about for manliness or feminists, they hit us with fluoride that's the opposite of the iodine.
[01:53:38.201 --> 01:53:39.922]  We've got it for 40% off as well.
[01:53:39.922 --> 01:53:40.823]  That sale's going to end soon.
[01:53:40.823 --> 01:53:41.324]  It's selling out.
[01:53:44.222 --> 01:53:47.905]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[01:53:47.905 --> 01:53:56.493]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[01:53:57.401 --> 01:54:04.127]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.

[01:54:18.839 --> 01:54:21.220]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:23.440]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.420]  This is insurance you can eat.

[01:54:45.314 --> 01:54:48.997]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[01:54:48.997 --> 01:54:57.565]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[01:54:58.493 --> 01:55:05.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[01:55:05.179 --> 01:55:08.703]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:18.392]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[01:55:18.892 --> 01:55:19.913]  But that's it.
[01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:22.315]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:24.537]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[01:55:24.537 --> 01:55:26.518]  This is insurance you can eat.
[01:55:26.518 --> 01:55:27.799]  It's the highest quality.

[01:55:30.661 --> 01:55:37.107]  All ready for you at InfoWareStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:55:37.107 --> 01:55:39.288]  Again, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:55:39.288 --> 01:55:40.749]  10% off on high-quality, storable food.
[01:55:40.749 --> 01:55:41.550]  Ready to ship.
[01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:43.332]  But it ends in just one week.
[01:55:43.332 --> 01:55:44.993]  So take action now while you still can.
[01:55:48.289 --> 01:55:59.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:04.204]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:56:04.204 --> 01:56:09.809]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:56:09.809 --> 01:56:12.552]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:56:15.032 --> 01:56:22.638]  Alright, here's Dick Durbin saying all politics is racial and Republicans are white supremacists basically.
[01:56:22.638 --> 01:56:25.019]  And so, they're going to be out of power because they're only for white people.
[01:56:25.019 --> 01:56:29.782]  Imagine announcing, this party can't be for anybody but white people.
[01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.924]  I mean, the Republicans have to call this out.
[01:56:31.924 --> 01:56:34.185]  The Democrats are nasty little monsters.
[01:56:34.185 --> 01:56:34.586]  Here he is.
[01:56:45.242 --> 01:56:47.423]  The answer is very simple.
[01:56:47.423 --> 01:56:52.224]  The demographics of America are not on the side of the Republican party.
[01:56:52.224 --> 01:57:02.687]  The new voters in this country are moving away from them, away from Donald Trump, away from their party creed that they preach.
[01:57:02.687 --> 01:57:09.048]  Instead, they're moving to be independents or to even vote on the other side.
[01:57:09.048 --> 01:57:10.869]  To argue and fight against that.
[01:57:11.696 --> 01:57:18.140]  The Republicans in legislative settings are reducing and restricting the opportunity to vote.
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.321]  That's what it's all about.
[01:57:20.321 --> 01:57:25.004]  The Senator from Kentucky attributes it to hysteria.
[01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:26.185]  It is not.
[01:57:26.185 --> 01:57:35.651]  It is a genuine concern over whether in this country, where democracy is our creed and our goal in every election,
[01:57:36.542 --> 01:57:45.025]  We have the most participation, fair participation, by eligible voters that we've ever had, and we continue to build on that.
[01:57:45.025 --> 01:57:50.868]  So he's saying demographically Republicans are doomed, but the numbers showed with Trump, record numbers of minorities voting for him.
[01:57:50.868 --> 01:57:51.588]  So that's not true.
[01:57:51.588 --> 01:57:52.548]  What do you make of this?
[01:57:52.548 --> 01:57:55.870]  I think this whole thing about this voting bill is just a bunch of crap.
[01:57:55.870 --> 01:58:00.112]  I mean, they're saying, hey, black people aren't going to be able to vote because they don't have ID.
[01:58:00.112 --> 01:58:03.033]  Um, excuse me, we have ID when we go to the liquor store.
[01:58:03.033 --> 01:58:06.114]  We have ID when we're in line at the club on the weekends.
[01:58:06.374 --> 01:58:12.556]  We also have ID when they ask us to show our ID when we're making a purchase with our debit cards.
[01:58:12.556 --> 01:58:26.221]  The fact that some of these people are saying that we don't know how to get on the internet, we don't know how to fill out an application, we don't know how to fill out an absentee vote because no one said that you can't fill vote if there's an issue with you standing in line.
[01:58:26.221 --> 01:58:28.682]  All they're saying is show your ID.
[01:58:28.682 --> 01:58:31.643]  This is about election integrity.
[01:58:32.283 --> 01:58:36.765]  Every citizen in America should be required to show identification.
[01:58:36.765 --> 01:58:40.087]  We want to know who these people are in case there's some sort of a crime.
[01:58:40.087 --> 01:58:42.248]  When I look at this man, you know what I see?
[01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:46.810]  I see somebody that's lying straight through their teeth because I'm not listening to him.
[01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:55.713]  I thought that he's also the same man that would not only vote for my children to be aborted, he would also vote to pay for it.
[01:58:55.713 --> 01:58:57.814]  You're not my friend, you're an enemy.
[01:58:57.814 --> 01:59:04.036]  You want to fund illegals coming across the border, but give us a message that we need to transition and abort our children.
[01:59:04.036 --> 01:59:06.917]  The devil is a lie, and the Democrats are too.
[01:59:06.917 --> 01:59:07.717]  Wow, beautifully said.
[01:59:07.717 --> 01:59:13.699]  I mean, they literally say, like if aliens landed and say, do not have any more children and cut your men's testicles off.
[01:59:14.239 --> 01:59:15.801]  You'd be like, well you're here to exterminate us.
[01:59:15.801 --> 01:59:16.982]  They're like, I love you!
[01:59:16.982 --> 01:59:17.903]  I love you!
[01:59:17.903 --> 01:59:21.086]  And all the corporate, you notice all the corporate pitchmen are black people now?
[01:59:21.086 --> 01:59:22.607]  That's not to help black people.
[01:59:22.607 --> 01:59:25.150]  It's the globalists hiding themselves behind a black face.
[01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:28.846]  That's exactly what it is, and this all points to one thing.
[01:59:28.846 --> 01:59:32.647]  Again, like we said, this is a depopulation agenda.
[01:59:32.647 --> 01:59:36.248]  And there are some people behind it, and they don't have your best interest at heart.
[01:59:36.248 --> 01:59:40.349]  One thing that we have to do is begin to vote for policy and not people.
[01:59:40.349 --> 01:59:43.030]  They want to try to paint Donald Trump as the bad guy.
[01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:44.450]  They want to paint him as the face.
[01:59:45.511 --> 02:00:00.761]  No, Donald Trump is a face of those people that want to be free, that don't want to be censored, that want to have the right to practice their faith, their religion, and also the people that have enough sense to know the difference between a man and a woman.
[02:00:00.761 --> 02:00:02.162]  Beautifully said.
[02:00:02.162 --> 02:00:04.404]  I'm going to come back and cover a bunch of news I haven't hit yet.
[02:00:04.404 --> 02:00:10.548]  You're going to get about a 20-minute, 25-minute break, and then you're going to host two segments, and I really appreciate you doing that.
[02:00:10.548 --> 02:00:12.470]  And then, of course, then Paul Watson will host the
[02:00:13.468 --> 02:00:14.449]  We're good to go.
[02:00:31.748 --> 02:00:35.412]  We're going to talk some more about this Equality Act that was signed by Joe Biden.
[02:00:35.412 --> 02:00:40.878]  We're going to get a little bit into Trump's censorship lawsuit that he put up against Big Tech.
[02:00:40.878 --> 02:00:47.886]  And we're going to get into what we can do, right, while we're in this battle to protect our children against this satanic agenda.
[02:00:47.886 --> 02:00:49.308]  A Born Talk Show host!
[02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:50.409]  My goodness, we'll be back.
[02:00:56.338 --> 02:00:57.599]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:00:57.599 --> 02:00:57.999]  Welcome.
[02:00:57.999 --> 02:00:58.440]  Go ahead.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.741]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:00:59.741 --> 02:01:00.301]  Good, brother.
[02:01:00.301 --> 02:01:01.402]  Great last caller.
[02:01:01.402 --> 02:01:04.464]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:01:04.464 --> 02:01:10.169]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:01:10.169 --> 02:01:11.750]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.932]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:01:13.932 --> 02:01:14.892]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:01:14.892 --> 02:01:15.253]  Go ahead.
[02:01:15.253 --> 02:01:15.673]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:15.673 --> 02:01:16.814]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:16.814 --> 02:01:21.498]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products, the XG, who does wonders.
[02:01:21.498 --> 02:01:22.639]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:01:22.639 --> 02:01:23.820]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:24.620]  Get off the fence.
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:25.301]  Get the product.
[02:01:25.301 --> 02:01:26.682]  Support the Infowar.
[02:01:26.682 --> 02:01:28.003]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:01:28.003 --> 02:01:28.664]  You're on the air.
[02:01:28.664 --> 02:01:29.204]  Thanks for rolling.
[02:01:29.204 --> 02:01:29.564]  Go ahead.
[02:01:29.564 --> 02:01:30.225]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:30.225 --> 02:01:31.346]  It's great to be on with you.
[02:01:31.346 --> 02:01:32.046]  It's an honor.
[02:01:32.046 --> 02:01:32.327]  Honor.
[02:01:32.327 --> 02:01:32.647]  Talk to you.
[02:01:32.867 --> 02:01:33.989]  Awesome.
[02:01:33.989 --> 02:01:37.614]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[02:01:37.614 --> 02:01:39.416]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:01:39.416 --> 02:01:41.900]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.522]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[02:01:43.522 --> 02:01:45.104]  So, just number one for a few reasons.
[02:01:45.104 --> 02:01:46.186]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:01:46.186 --> 02:01:47.828]  It's not a joke.
[02:01:47.828 --> 02:01:48.429]  Absolutely.
[02:01:57.797 --> 02:02:03.443]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:02:03.443 --> 02:02:07.306]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:02:07.306 --> 02:02:20.399]  This magic moment, so different and so new, was like any other until I kissed you.
[02:02:23.724 --> 02:02:25.585]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:25.585 --> 02:02:27.886]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:02:27.886 --> 02:02:31.628]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[02:02:31.628 --> 02:02:36.491]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[02:02:36.491 --> 02:02:40.773]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[02:02:40.773 --> 02:02:43.535]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[02:02:45.814 --> 02:02:54.362]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family.
[02:02:55.376 --> 02:03:04.762]  Everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in.
[02:03:04.762 --> 02:03:09.584]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[02:03:09.584 --> 02:03:12.326]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:03:12.326 --> 02:03:15.668]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[02:03:15.668 --> 02:03:18.850]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:31.490]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:34.892]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[02:03:34.892 --> 02:03:39.396]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[02:03:40.223 --> 02:03:42.663]  And the will to be able to face this fire.
[02:03:42.663 --> 02:03:44.284]  And to give me the strength to carry on.
[02:03:44.284 --> 02:03:53.745]  Because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[02:03:53.745 --> 02:03:54.746]  I know why.
[02:03:54.746 --> 02:04:00.307]  Because it's scary.
[02:04:00.307 --> 02:04:04.687]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[02:04:04.687 --> 02:04:07.028]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:04:07.028 --> 02:04:07.988]  You're not going to be able to just
[02:04:09.525 --> 02:04:12.727]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[02:04:12.727 --> 02:04:35.901]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[02:04:37.549 --> 02:04:43.030]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:45.151]  It should take over your life.
[02:04:45.151 --> 02:04:46.571]  I mean, what else?
[02:04:46.571 --> 02:04:49.832]  What else could it do?
[02:04:49.832 --> 02:05:00.175]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open... of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:05.292]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[02:05:05.292 --> 02:05:13.258]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[02:05:13.258 --> 02:05:16.301]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[02:05:18.184 --> 02:05:21.625]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:05:21.625 --> 02:05:31.127]  The globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents, that they want to create race-specific bioweapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[02:05:31.127 --> 02:05:42.189]  A lot of this, from my sources, is that they're preparing to release bioweapons, claim that they're naturally occurring, and then use that as the cover for civil emergency societies.
[02:05:42.329 --> 02:05:42.749]  We're good to go.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:06:03.823]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out, and they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S.
[02:06:03.823 --> 02:06:05.364]  to one government announcement.
[02:06:05.364 --> 02:06:14.247]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the U.N.
[02:06:14.247 --> 02:06:19.169]  has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[02:06:19.169 --> 02:06:20.049]  InfoWars.
[02:06:20.049 --> 02:06:21.109]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.830]  Today.
[02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:22.490]  Dr. Fauci.
[02:06:23.365 --> 02:06:29.949]  We don't know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally, but we should want to know.
[02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:35.372]  Three million people have died from this pandemic and that should cause us to explore all possibilities.
[02:06:35.372 --> 02:06:42.996]  Instead, government authorities, self-interested in continuing gain-of-function research, say there's nothing to see here.
[02:06:42.996 --> 02:06:49.120]  Gain-of-function research, as you know, is juicing up naturally occurring animal viruses to infect humans.
[02:06:49.989 --> 02:06:51.951]  To arrive at the truth, the U.S.
[02:06:51.951 --> 02:07:00.021]  government should admit that the Wuhan Virology Institute was experimenting to enhance the coronavirus' ability to infect humans.
[02:07:00.021 --> 02:07:03.144]  Juicing up super viruses is not new.
[02:07:03.144 --> 02:07:04.185]  Scientists in the U.S.
[02:07:04.185 --> 02:07:07.249]  have long known how to mutate animal viruses to infect humans.
[02:07:07.913 --> 02:07:21.182]  For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the U.S., has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, sharing his discoveries about how to create super viruses.
[02:07:21.182 --> 02:07:25.605]  This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH.
[02:07:25.605 --> 02:07:28.386]  The collaboration between the U.S.
[02:07:28.386 --> 02:07:30.608]  and the Wuhan Virology Institute continues.
[02:07:31.391 --> 02:07:45.036]  Doctors Barak and Shi worked together to insert bat virus spike protein into the backbone of the deadly SARS virus and then use this man-made super virus to infect human airway cells.
[02:07:45.999 --> 02:07:47.982]  Think about that for a moment.
[02:07:47.982 --> 02:07:51.586]  The SARS virus had a 15% mortality.
[02:07:51.586 --> 02:07:55.491]  We're fighting a pandemic that has about a 1% mortality.
[02:07:55.491 --> 02:08:05.303]  Can you imagine if a SARS virus that's been juiced up and had viral proteins added to it, to the spike protein, if that were released accidentally?
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:13.365]  Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[02:08:13.365 --> 02:08:30.697]  Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect that the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:08:32.401 --> 02:08:37.084]  We do not fund... Do you fund Dr. Barrett's gain-of-function research?
[02:08:37.084 --> 02:08:46.531]  Dr. Barrett does not do gain-of-function research, and if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina.
[02:08:46.531 --> 02:08:53.875]  You don't think inserting a bat virus spike protein that he got from the Wuhan Institute into the SARS virus is gain-of-function?
[02:08:53.875 --> 02:09:02.101]  That is not... You would be in the minority because at least 200 scientists have signed a statement from the Cambridge Working Group saying that it is gain-of-function.
[02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:03.703]  Well, it is not.
[02:09:03.703 --> 02:09:11.211]  And if you look at the grant, and you look at the progress reports, it has not gained a function, despite the fact...
[02:09:11.781 --> 02:09:13.422]  That people tweet that?
[02:09:13.422 --> 02:09:17.325]  So do you still support sending money to the Wuhan Virology Institute?
[02:09:17.325 --> 02:09:19.607]  We do not send money now to the Wuhan Virology Institute.
[02:09:19.607 --> 02:09:21.468]  Do you support sending money?
[02:09:21.468 --> 02:09:23.030]  We did, under your tutelage.
[02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:24.911]  We were sending it through EcoHealth.
[02:09:24.911 --> 02:09:27.533]  It was a sub-agency and a sub-grant.
[02:09:27.533 --> 02:09:31.716]  Do you support the money from NIH that was going to the Wuhan Institute?
[02:09:31.716 --> 02:09:34.258]  Let me explain to you why that was done.
[02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:41.566]  The SARS-CoV-1 originated in bats in China.
[02:09:42.376 --> 02:09:53.200]  It would have been irresponsible of us if we did not investigate the bat viruses and the serology to see who might have been infected in China.
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:10:03.403]  Or perhaps it would be irresponsible to send it to the Chinese government that we may not be able to trust with this knowledge and with this incredibly dangerous viruses.
[02:10:03.403 --> 02:10:09.345]  Government scientists like yourself who favor... Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us again here today.
[02:10:10.126 --> 02:10:18.233]  The reason I replayed this from May, and we've got another article about it today, is Fauci's back out making denials in the press that they ever fund a gain-of-function.
[02:10:18.233 --> 02:10:23.597]  They called it the Gain-of-Function Research Grant.
[02:10:23.597 --> 02:10:26.559]  And the reason I wanted to play that is what we're going to cover when we come back.
[02:10:26.559 --> 02:10:32.804]  Now, when I say I've over-prepared for something, that's not a joke.
[02:10:32.804 --> 02:10:35.666]  The media always picks that up and goes, oh, Jones couldn't cover it.
[02:10:35.666 --> 02:10:36.407]  He was over-prepared.
[02:10:37.145 --> 02:10:41.368]  Yeah, like I've got too much to cover here in the 10 minutes I've got left before I gotta go.
[02:10:41.368 --> 02:10:43.809]  And then our amazing guest host is going to take over.
[02:10:43.809 --> 02:10:51.934]  That lady's energy is just incredible.
[02:10:51.934 --> 02:11:02.141]  Fauci is all over TV and now everyone is regurgitating the lie that 99% of the deaths of COVID are from people unvaccinated.
[02:11:02.927 --> 02:11:05.549]  You can spend 30 seconds and go to the U.S.
[02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:08.171]  government's own numbers and that's completely false.
[02:11:08.171 --> 02:11:13.455]  And in fact, almost 50% of the new COVID deaths are in the vaccinated.
[02:11:13.455 --> 02:11:18.980]  I have the damn documents and articles right here!
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:27.887]  But I've got Fox and CNN and all of them like demonic parrots repeating the same lie over and over again.
[02:11:27.887 --> 02:11:30.229]  So if I just show you these headlines and talk about this,
[02:11:31.101 --> 02:11:31.962]  It doesn't really do anything.
[02:11:31.962 --> 02:11:35.525]  We need to do special reports, special shows, emergency broadcasts.
[02:11:35.525 --> 02:11:39.848]  I don't know what we're going to call this.
[02:11:39.848 --> 02:11:40.809]  And I love this crew.
[02:11:40.809 --> 02:11:41.709]  They do a great job.
[02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:51.137]  I've tried to hire more people so I can go live, even more than just my show, but... I'm going to talk to the crew and see who wants to come here tonight and do a live show about this, because we've got to do a whole show on this.
[02:11:52.105 --> 02:11:53.065]  Hey everybody!
[02:11:53.065 --> 02:11:58.566]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:11:58.566 --> 02:12:01.007]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:12:01.007 --> 02:12:01.867]  Here's the thing.
[02:12:01.867 --> 02:12:06.148]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:12:06.148 --> 02:12:07.508]  Survival soup beans.
[02:12:07.508 --> 02:12:15.690]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:12:15.690 --> 02:12:16.230]  The best part?
[02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:26.097]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:12:26.097 --> 02:12:27.118]  Gets even better!

[02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:56.113]  Your voice counts.
[02:12:56.113 --> 02:13:01.175]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:13:01.175 --> 02:13:03.756]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:13:03.756 --> 02:13:04.536]  They know you're angry.
[02:13:05.257 --> 02:13:10.664]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[02:13:52.992 --> 02:13:55.452]  The world is awakening.
[02:13:55.452 --> 02:13:58.953]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[02:13:58.953 --> 02:14:10.255]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[02:14:10.255 --> 02:14:20.037]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[02:14:20.037 --> 02:14:22.517]  We have forced them out in the open.
[02:14:23.172 --> 02:14:28.995]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[02:14:28.995 --> 02:14:34.017]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust the plan of God's justice.
[02:14:34.017 --> 02:14:35.457]  That is invincible.
[02:14:35.457 --> 02:14:38.879]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[02:14:38.879 --> 02:14:44.642]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[02:14:44.642 --> 02:14:48.703]  And realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[02:14:48.703 --> 02:14:52.485]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[02:14:53.482 --> 02:14:55.785]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena.
[02:14:55.785 --> 02:14:58.188]  A man under Teddy Roosevelt's own heart.
[02:14:58.188 --> 02:15:02.193]  People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right.
[02:15:02.193 --> 02:15:08.300]  The audits are coming out and there was total, absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:08.761]  That is
[02:15:09.341 --> 02:15:10.702]  The bottom line.
[02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:16.668]  And Mike Lindell is getting sued by all these big, powerful, globalist institutions trying to shut him down.
[02:15:16.668 --> 02:15:25.356]  That's why it's so important to support MyPillow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America.
[02:15:25.356 --> 02:15:27.578]  Because he's doing God's work.
[02:15:27.578 --> 02:15:29.840]  And at the same time, he's funding InfoWars.
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:30.380]  That's right.

[02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:56.191]  MyPillow.com, promo code ALEX.
[02:15:56.191 --> 02:15:58.852]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:18.024 --> 02:16:28.297]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:16:28.297 --> 02:16:31.621]  Let me tell you, I'm impressed with Angela Stanton King.
[02:16:31.621 --> 02:16:33.563]  It's made me feel like five years younger just being in here.
[02:16:33.563 --> 02:16:35.466]  I don't know what's going on with that lady, but she's got some energy.
[02:16:36.878 --> 02:16:42.662]  And she's going to be host of the next two segments and I'm inviting her back in the next month to come here and spend three or four days with all the shows.
[02:16:42.662 --> 02:16:43.362]  Her amazing work.
[02:16:43.362 --> 02:16:46.784]  She's going to be host of the next two segments because I got a doctor's appointment I had to reschedule.
[02:16:46.784 --> 02:16:58.692]  But I'm coming back at three o'clock today and I'm going to tape a special emergency report with all this research I've got that is going to air at six o'clock tonight when Owen Schroer goes off the air.
[02:16:58.692 --> 02:17:00.673]  I don't know if I'm going to stream it over the satellites.
[02:17:00.673 --> 02:17:02.034]  I may do that too.
[02:17:02.034 --> 02:17:03.975]  Or I may just post it to Bandot Video but
[02:17:07.615 --> 02:17:13.298]  Fauci is all over TV saying 99% of people dying haven't had the vaccine.
[02:17:13.298 --> 02:17:14.238]  And I've got the numbers.
[02:17:14.238 --> 02:17:15.579]  He's a liar.
[02:17:15.579 --> 02:17:22.502]  Depending on the UK, Israel, the US, it's all 46 to 52% dying have already had the shot.
[02:17:22.502 --> 02:17:25.584]  And most of the new cases are in vaccinated.
[02:17:25.584 --> 02:17:26.524]  Because it's all a fraud.
[02:17:26.524 --> 02:17:27.985]  It's that damn PCR test.
[02:17:27.985 --> 02:17:29.726]  I mean, who knows what the truth is?
[02:17:29.726 --> 02:17:31.907]  It's so many damn lies.
[02:17:31.907 --> 02:17:33.608]  Now, I told you
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:43.667]  About this big article that Jamie White did for ImpulseWars.com, Rand Paul calls out Fauci for lying to Congress over gain-of-function research.
[02:17:43.667 --> 02:17:51.853]  And we played you a clip from a few months ago, because now Fauci's back and he completely melts down.
[02:17:51.853 --> 02:17:53.935]  So we're going to get to that video here in just a moment.
[02:17:53.935 --> 02:18:00.760]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, we have products that are game-changing.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:03.082]  And you heard our guest, Angela Stanton King,
[02:18:05.046 --> 02:18:07.649]  Who knows who I am, but hasn't really seen the show.
[02:18:07.649 --> 02:18:09.951]  Because I asked her, I said, how do you know about the depopulation?
[02:18:09.951 --> 02:18:10.732]  You know everything I know.
[02:18:10.732 --> 02:18:13.114]  And she goes, well, I've just been living and I'm researching it.
[02:18:13.114 --> 02:18:15.296]  So that's when you know we're winning, folks.
[02:18:15.296 --> 02:18:16.757]  There's this amazing lady.
[02:18:16.757 --> 02:18:19.460]  He's got everything I got and just as much or maybe more.
[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:21.802]  And she didn't get it from me.
[02:18:21.802 --> 02:18:22.763]  That is exciting.
[02:18:22.763 --> 02:18:24.025]  And she's pissed.
[02:18:24.025 --> 02:18:25.526]  And she knows humanity is under attack.
[02:18:25.526 --> 02:18:26.167]  And she gets it.
[02:18:26.167 --> 02:18:27.588]  And she's not backing down.
[02:18:27.588 --> 02:18:28.529]  That's exciting.
[02:18:29.381 --> 02:18:34.606]  And that's the type of people we need in Congress, and that's the type of person I'd love to have her as president, wouldn't you?
[02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:43.595]  The point is, is that we know we're under attack, but we gotta warn others and we gotta say, we're not taking this crap anymore from these globalists.
[02:18:43.595 --> 02:18:45.858]  But I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:18:45.858 --> 02:18:49.121]  So, the MyPillow advertisements brought a little bit of extra money, that's great.
[02:18:49.747 --> 02:18:53.029]  But then, for anything I plugged, and we don't sell our own products at that time.
[02:18:53.029 --> 02:18:57.032]  So I got called into the accountant's office this morning, and they said, yeah, you're feeling real good about my pillow plugs.
[02:18:57.032 --> 02:18:57.753]  It's great products.
[02:18:57.753 --> 02:19:00.835]  But you know, when you didn't plug our products yesterday, we had a major shortfall.
[02:19:00.835 --> 02:19:02.296]  So it kind of averages out.
[02:19:02.296 --> 02:19:04.678]  So I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining.
[02:19:04.678 --> 02:19:06.899]  I'm saying we got products you already need.
[02:19:06.899 --> 02:19:11.042]  We're not like the Black Rifle Company coffee that says, you know, all our supporters suck.
[02:19:11.042 --> 02:19:11.943]  We hate gun owners.
[02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:13.184]  We hate Americans.
[02:19:13.184 --> 02:19:16.006]  You know, we, you know, we think white people are evil or whatever.
[02:19:16.966 --> 02:19:20.849]  We just sell coffee that's high quality, and of course we wouldn't turn our backs on Kyle Rittenhouse.
[02:19:20.849 --> 02:19:23.370]  We got coffee way back, and I'm not even in competition with those guys.
[02:19:23.370 --> 02:19:28.513]  There's the New York Times, literally crapping all over America, so I'm gonna have to declare war on those guys.
[02:19:28.513 --> 02:19:36.719]  The point is, is that we are steadfast, we're not backing down, and we need you to buy a book, a coffee mug, a t-shirt, a whatever.
[02:19:36.719 --> 02:19:40.241]  We appreciate you, we're not bitching at you, we're just saying, hey, we're in this fight together.
[02:19:40.241 --> 02:19:41.882]  I don't back down, but I need your support.
[02:19:42.654 --> 02:19:46.658]  So, green fiber capsules with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals.
[02:19:46.658 --> 02:19:49.901]  So good for you from the very best sprouts.
[02:19:49.901 --> 02:19:51.182]  It is $19.95 discounted.
[02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:53.144]  Winter Sun's back in stock, 50% off.
[02:19:53.144 --> 02:19:56.547]  Knockout Sleep Support and Down and Out Sleep Support both back in, 50% off.
[02:19:56.547 --> 02:19:57.588]  It's a limited time.
[02:19:57.588 --> 02:19:59.430]  Storable Food Sale will end this Sunday.
[02:19:59.430 --> 02:20:00.210]  I barely plugged it.
[02:20:00.210 --> 02:20:01.752]  It's extended one week, 10% off.
[02:20:01.752 --> 02:20:02.713]  Get $2,020 prices today.
[02:20:02.713 --> 02:20:04.294]  And then separately,
[02:20:08.197 --> 02:20:10.839]  We also have the big enchilada.
[02:20:10.839 --> 02:20:13.901]  And I told you, I just got to sell this to get money in.
[02:20:13.901 --> 02:20:19.365]  And so I was selling these spray bottles of X2, just because that's what we had the majority of.
[02:20:19.365 --> 02:20:24.069]  Total same bottle, same stuff in it, just different spray cap instead of a dropper cap.
[02:20:24.069 --> 02:20:26.071]  We sold out of this.
[02:20:26.071 --> 02:20:29.673]  They just told me 10 minutes ago during the break, it'll be sold out by the end of the day.
[02:20:29.673 --> 02:20:32.475]  So that's gone back to regular price until it sells out.
[02:20:32.475 --> 02:20:35.918]  Survival Shield X2 dropper bottle, exact same product.
[02:20:36.876 --> 02:20:45.760]  40% off until it sells out, and if you haven't experienced atomic iodine, the opposite of the fluoride, the thing that makes you masculine, the thing that makes you feminine, is the iodine.
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:50.061]  That's why they hit you with the bad halogen fluoride and that whole family.
[02:20:50.061 --> 02:20:52.362]  This is the opposite of what they want you to have.
[02:20:52.362 --> 02:20:54.483]  This is what you should have, and it's selling out.
[02:20:54.483 --> 02:20:57.624]  X2, infowarestore.com, 40% off.
[02:20:57.624 --> 02:21:05.227]  Here is Senator Rand Paul destroying Fauci, and Fauci's shaking with anger because his criminal actions of launching the COVID attack is coming out.
[02:21:06.579 --> 02:21:23.953]  Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist from Rutgers, described this research in Wuhan as, the Wuhan lab used NIH funding to construct novel chimeric SARS-related coronaviruses able to infect human cells and laboratory animals.
[02:21:23.953 --> 02:21:35.403]  This is high-risk research that creates new potential pandemic pathogens, potential pandemic pathogens that exist only in the lab, not in nature.
[02:21:36.132 --> 02:21:52.778]  This research matches, these are Dr. Ebright's words, this research matches, indeed epitomizes, the definition of gain-of-function research, done entirely in Wuhan, for which there was supposed to be a federal pause.
[02:21:52.778 --> 02:22:03.102]  Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[02:22:11.066 --> 02:22:18.431]  Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement.
[02:22:18.431 --> 02:22:28.839]  This paper that you are referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain of function.
[02:22:30.093 --> 02:22:30.814]  Let me finish.
[02:22:30.814 --> 02:22:34.577]  You shake an animal virus and you increase its transmissibility to humans.
[02:22:34.577 --> 02:22:36.199]  You're saying that's not gain of function?
[02:22:36.199 --> 02:22:37.560]  That is correct.
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:41.865]  And Senator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly.
[02:22:41.865 --> 02:22:44.267]  And I want to say that officially.
[02:22:44.267 --> 02:22:46.930]  You do not know what you are talking about.
[02:22:47.535 --> 02:22:52.018]  Let's read from the NIH definition of gain of function.
[02:22:52.018 --> 02:22:55.341]  This is your definition that you guys wrote.
[02:22:55.341 --> 02:23:03.167]  It says that scientific research that increases the transmissibility among animals is gain of function.
[02:23:03.647 --> 02:23:10.210]  They took animal viruses that only occur in animals, and they increased their transmissibility to humans.
[02:23:10.210 --> 02:23:12.351]  How you can say that is not gain-of-function?
[02:23:12.351 --> 02:23:12.931]  It is not.
[02:23:12.931 --> 02:23:21.554]  It's a dance, and you're dancing around this because you're trying to obscure responsibility for four million people dying around the world from a pandemic.
[02:23:21.554 --> 02:23:25.276]  And let's, let's, Dr. Fauci... I have to, well, now you're getting into something.
[02:23:25.276 --> 02:23:27.357]  If the point that you are making
[02:23:27.977 --> 02:23:37.300]  Is that the grant that was funded as a sub-award from EcoHealth to Wuhan created SARS-CoV-2.
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:38.920]  That's where you are getting.
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:39.801]  Let me finish.
[02:23:39.801 --> 02:23:40.381]  We don't know.
[02:23:40.381 --> 02:23:49.264]  We don't know if it did come from the lab, but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab, and there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab, including yourself.
[02:23:49.264 --> 02:23:52.605]  I totally... This committee will allow the witness to respond.
[02:23:52.605 --> 02:23:57.166]  I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating, Senator.
[02:23:57.876 --> 02:24:03.682]  Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments...
[02:24:04.378 --> 02:24:09.660]  That were given in the annual reports that were published in the literature.
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:12.981]  It is molecularly impossible.
[02:24:12.981 --> 02:24:15.362]  No one's saying those viruses caused it.
[02:24:15.362 --> 02:24:18.123]  No one is alleging that those viruses caused the pandemic.
[02:24:18.123 --> 02:24:23.605]  What we're alleging is the gain-of-function research was going on in that lab and NIH funded it.
[02:24:23.605 --> 02:24:25.286]  Get away from it.
[02:24:25.286 --> 02:24:28.347]  It meets your definition and you are obfuscating the truth.
[02:24:28.567 --> 02:24:30.068]  I'm not obfuscating the truth.
[02:24:30.068 --> 02:24:32.349]  You are the one.
[02:24:32.349 --> 02:24:34.229]  Let me just finish.
[02:24:34.229 --> 02:24:48.095]  I want everyone to understand that if you look at those viruses, and that's judged by qualified virologists and evolutionary biologists, those viruses are molecularly impossible to result in SARS-CoV-2.
[02:24:48.095 --> 02:24:49.155]  Your voice counts.
[02:24:56.972 --> 02:25:02.035]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:25:02.035 --> 02:25:04.617]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:25:04.617 --> 02:25:06.118]  They know you're angry.
[02:25:06.118 --> 02:25:11.521]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:25:11.521 --> 02:25:20.747]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports,

[02:25:53.112 --> 02:25:56.794]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:25:56.794 --> 02:26:05.380]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[02:26:06.292 --> 02:26:13.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[02:26:13.017 --> 02:26:16.500]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.

[02:26:24.245 --> 02:26:26.187]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[02:26:26.687 --> 02:26:27.727]  But that's it.
[02:26:27.727 --> 02:26:30.128]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[02:26:30.128 --> 02:26:32.329]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[02:26:32.329 --> 02:26:34.310]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:26:34.310 --> 02:26:35.571]  It's the highest quality.

[02:26:48.536 --> 02:26:49.336]  Ready to ship.

[02:26:51.117 --> 02:26:52.778]  So take action now while you still can.
[02:26:53.018 --> 02:27:00.011]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[02:27:00.575 --> 02:27:06.079]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[02:27:06.079 --> 02:27:13.945]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[02:27:13.945 --> 02:27:15.426]  Humanity is strong.
[02:27:15.426 --> 02:27:16.386]  We're incredible.
[02:27:16.386 --> 02:27:20.169]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[02:27:20.169 --> 02:27:22.631]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:28.555]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[02:27:28.995 --> 02:27:38.624]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[02:27:38.624 --> 02:27:40.946]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:27:40.946 --> 02:27:43.388]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[02:27:43.388 --> 02:27:48.933]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[02:27:48.933 --> 02:27:52.917]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[02:27:53.237 --> 02:28:01.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:28:01.741 --> 02:28:11.565]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:28:12.325 --> 02:28:15.229]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[02:28:15.229 --> 02:28:16.411]  Listen to this.
[02:28:16.411 --> 02:28:17.672]  Organic pea fiber.
[02:28:17.672 --> 02:28:19.114]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[02:28:19.114 --> 02:28:20.576]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[02:28:20.576 --> 02:28:22.018]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[02:28:22.018 --> 02:28:23.440]  Organic kale leaf.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:24.982]  Organic flax sprout.
[02:28:24.982 --> 02:28:26.604]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[02:28:26.604 --> 02:28:27.345]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:28:27.925 --> 02:28:30.026]  All of these things are so incredible for your health.
[02:28:30.026 --> 02:28:33.867]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[02:28:33.867 --> 02:28:38.609]  And we've packed it all in to fibergreen caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:38.609 --> 02:28:42.531]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[02:28:42.531 --> 02:28:44.711]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[02:28:44.711 --> 02:28:47.532]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[02:28:47.532 --> 02:28:49.053]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:56.204 --> 02:29:19.662]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:19.662 --> 02:29:23.565]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:29:24.612 --> 02:29:29.186]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:29:32.515 --> 02:29:33.796]  What's up, everybody?
[02:29:33.796 --> 02:29:36.378]  This is your new host of InfoWars.
[02:29:36.378 --> 02:29:39.380]  For the next 30 minutes, Angela Stanton King.
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:41.262]  Alex had to step off for a little bit.
[02:29:41.262 --> 02:29:43.043]  He knew I had it under control.
[02:29:43.043 --> 02:29:46.866]  We're going to get back into something real quick before we go to another segment.
[02:29:46.866 --> 02:29:49.228]  Let's touch back on the Equality Act.
[02:29:49.228 --> 02:29:58.856]  You know, we were talking about that Joe Biden made it important that he signed that executive order and how it impacts our children and what's coming down the pipeline in our education system.
[02:29:59.276 --> 02:30:03.558]  Listen, I went to the daycare the other day with a friend of mine to pick up my goddaughter.
[02:30:03.558 --> 02:30:05.279]  This is a daycare.
[02:30:05.279 --> 02:30:07.400]  Her daughter is two years old.
[02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:12.041]  We walk into the front of the school, and this is what's up on the board.
[02:30:12.041 --> 02:30:15.243]  And as you can see in the brown puzzle, it says,
[02:30:15.843 --> 02:30:18.104]  Sexual orientation.
[02:30:18.104 --> 02:30:28.610]  Come to find out this particular school, which is the children's courtyard, they're all over the United States and there are hundreds of them.
[02:30:28.610 --> 02:30:29.871]  I had a question.
[02:30:29.871 --> 02:30:45.119]  Hey listen, I'm not against anybody's preference or anything that anyone is doing, but why is sexual orientation, which is someone's preference for sex, listed on a bulletin board at a daycare for two-year-olds?
[02:30:45.899 --> 02:30:49.322]  I was given the answer that it's all about diversity.
[02:30:49.322 --> 02:30:55.208]  And if we didn't like it, we could take our child out of that school and take her somewhere else.
[02:30:55.208 --> 02:30:57.871]  Listen, America, we're in trouble.
[02:30:57.871 --> 02:30:59.833]  It's time for us to wake up.
[02:30:59.833 --> 02:31:07.640]  Did you also know that in our schools now, they are allowing our children to be called by gender neutral names?
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:10.343]  If they go in and say, hey, I want to be called
[02:31:10.988 --> 02:31:16.650]  Jill, and my name is really Jack, the teachers are doing it and they're not notifying the parents.
[02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:21.992]  What are your children being taught and why are we allowing that to happen?
[02:31:21.992 --> 02:31:28.995]  But I think that it's important that we wake up and realize that this agenda is serious and we need to get serious in fighting it.
[02:31:29.969 --> 02:31:31.110]  That's what we need to do.
[02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:33.351]  So let's move on to our next subject.
[02:31:33.351 --> 02:31:34.771]  President Trump.
[02:31:34.771 --> 02:31:36.492]  I think we've got a clip of him.
[02:31:36.492 --> 02:31:45.616]  As you heard Alex say, listen, all of my Instagram, my social media, my Twitter, my Facebook, all of my accounts have been disabled and suspended.
[02:31:46.457 --> 02:31:49.919]  Nearly 1 million followers and supporters.
[02:31:49.919 --> 02:31:50.679]  Why?
[02:31:50.679 --> 02:31:53.560]  Because I'm not telling people that abortion is health care.
[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.302]  I'm telling them that abortion is death care.
[02:31:56.302 --> 02:32:03.865]  Because I'm telling people that, hey, LGBTQ, even though that's your preference and you're an adult, they're all sexualities.
[02:32:03.865 --> 02:32:06.486]  Why are we tying sex to children?
[02:32:06.486 --> 02:32:11.689]  Who looks at a 4-year-old or a 5-year-old and labels them a sexuality?
[02:32:12.415 --> 02:32:16.837]  No, I don't get a Cadillac commercial for preaching abortion.
[02:32:16.837 --> 02:32:20.099]  I get censored for being pro-life.
[02:32:20.099 --> 02:32:23.720]  President Trump recently filed a lawsuit against Big Tech.
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:24.821]  Let's hear what he had to say.
[02:32:24.821 --> 02:32:40.088]  I just want to say that I stand before you this morning to announce a very important and very beautiful, I think, development for our freedom and our freedom of speech.
[02:32:40.088 --> 02:32:41.469]  And that goes to all Americans.
[02:32:42.549 --> 02:33:09.147]  Today, in conjunction with the America First Policy Institute, I'm filing, as the lead class representative, a major class action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, as well as their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jack Dorsey.
[02:33:09.147 --> 02:33:10.488]  Three real nice guys.
[02:33:13.542 --> 02:33:15.603]  We're asking the U.S.
[02:33:15.603 --> 02:33:30.052]  District Court for the Southern District of Florida to order an immediate halt to social media companies' illegal, shameful censorship of the American people, and that's exactly what they are doing.
[02:33:30.052 --> 02:33:42.340]  We're demanding an end to the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing, and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing, and canceling that you know so well.
[02:33:43.428 --> 02:33:51.772]  Our case will prove this censorship is unlawful, it's unconstitutional, and it's completely un-American.
[02:33:51.772 --> 02:33:52.532]  We all know that.
[02:33:52.532 --> 02:33:56.014]  We all know that very, very well.
[02:33:56.014 --> 02:34:10.440]  Our filing also seeks injunctive relief to allow prompt restitution and really restoration and you can name about 20 other things that it has to be prompt because it's destroying our country.
[02:34:11.673 --> 02:34:22.302]  Of my accounts, in addition, we are asking the court to impose punitive damages on these social media giants.
[02:34:22.302 --> 02:34:26.246]  We're going to hold Big Tech very accountable.
[02:34:26.246 --> 02:34:30.910]  This is the first of numerous other lawsuits, I assume, that would follow.
[02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:37.135]  But this is the lead, and I think it's going to be a very, very important game changer for our country.
[02:34:38.087 --> 02:34:51.417]  It will be a pivotal battle in the defense of the First Amendment, and in the end, I am confident that we will achieve a historic victory for American freedom, and at the same time, freedom of speech.
[02:34:57.665 --> 02:35:00.968]  Did you just hear what President Trump said?
[02:35:00.968 --> 02:35:05.211]  You know, I was sitting back and I was watching and I follow President Trump on Twitter.
[02:35:05.211 --> 02:35:10.995]  I also follow him on Instagram because I was very hip and aware of how fake news could be.
[02:35:10.995 --> 02:35:12.496]  I had been in the media before.
[02:35:12.496 --> 02:35:16.279]  I had, you know, a 30 million dollar frivolous lawsuit filed against me.
[02:35:16.279 --> 02:35:17.940]  I was made out to be the bad guy.
[02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:19.321]  None of that stuff was true.
[02:35:19.321 --> 02:35:23.324]  And it took a long time for me to be able to prove my truth in court.
[02:35:23.324 --> 02:35:24.125]  But I stood on it.
[02:35:24.445 --> 02:35:30.428]  But I sat and I watched how the media not only attacked the President, but also attacked people like me that supported him.
[02:35:30.428 --> 02:35:34.509]  Somehow me, with my brown skin, instantly became a white supremacist.
[02:35:34.509 --> 02:35:39.571]  But Trump's social media allowed him to debunk everything that they said.
[02:35:39.571 --> 02:35:41.932]  It allowed him to show his truth.
[02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:45.494]  And when they silenced the sitting President of the United States,
[02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:49.896]  I knew then that there was no hope for the rest of us.
[02:35:49.896 --> 02:35:53.262]  If they could silence a sitting president.
[02:35:53.262 --> 02:35:55.105]  Hey, what if there's an emergency?
[02:35:55.105 --> 02:35:56.587]  What if a bomb goes off?
[02:35:56.587 --> 02:35:58.491]  This guy is who's in control.
[02:35:58.491 --> 02:35:59.493]  He has the power.
[02:36:00.169 --> 02:36:04.354]  How do you silence a United States sitting president?
[02:36:04.354 --> 02:36:11.642]  I knew then that Big Tech had too much power and after that they start coming after us one by one.
[02:36:11.642 --> 02:36:13.464]  Me, they consider me to be a threat.
[02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:13.884]  Why?
[02:36:13.884 --> 02:36:16.988]  Not only am I a Trump supporter, I'm a black Trump supporter.
[02:36:16.988 --> 02:36:18.890]  Listen, Mr. President, you know I love you.
[02:36:19.290 --> 02:36:21.291]  I sent them my information already.
[02:36:21.291 --> 02:36:22.853]  I've got all of my screenshots.
[02:36:22.853 --> 02:36:25.434]  I've got all of my emails, anything that you need.
[02:36:25.434 --> 02:36:31.979]  I'll be glad to join hands with you on this lawsuit because freedom of speech is a real thing.
[02:36:31.979 --> 02:36:33.480]  This is serious.
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:39.844]  Even going back to the Equality Act, things that were signed by Joe Biden where they banned conversion therapy.
[02:36:39.844 --> 02:36:44.647]  These things take away your rights as a parent.
[02:36:44.647 --> 02:36:46.048]  You have the freedom of speech.
[02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:57.599]  If someone is telling your child something that you don't believe or something that you don't support, as a parent, you should have the right to tell your child the truth.
[02:36:57.599 --> 02:36:58.500]  Look at my story.
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:00.422]  This is real, guys.
[02:37:00.422 --> 02:37:02.303]  Have you been following me?
[02:37:02.303 --> 02:37:09.109]  Do you not see what's happening and what's playing out before our eyes right here in America?
[02:37:09.109 --> 02:37:12.032]  This country is being taken over.
[02:37:12.032 --> 02:37:13.133]  It's being stolen.
[02:37:13.954 --> 02:37:17.337]  And swept right from up under our feet.
[02:37:17.337 --> 02:37:20.780]  They wanted to make it seem as though this was all about racism.
[02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:21.961]  No, it wasn't.
[02:37:21.961 --> 02:37:23.462]  This was about our freedom.
[02:37:23.462 --> 02:37:27.825]  So that lawsuit that Trump filed, you know, I pay attention to what's going on.
[02:37:27.825 --> 02:37:37.954]  It seems like that came right on the heels of a bill that Governor DeSantis signed down in Florida, allowing people to be able to sue big tech.
[02:37:38.514 --> 02:37:42.337]  If I'm right, I do believe that Trump is in Florida.
[02:37:42.337 --> 02:37:46.139]  So maybe these two have gotten together and decided, hey, we're going to do something.
[02:37:46.139 --> 02:37:55.305]  But do you guys also remember before they silenced Trump on Twitter and he was begging Congress to do something about Section 230?
[02:37:55.305 --> 02:37:56.946]  He knew this was coming.
[02:37:56.946 --> 02:37:58.667]  How did this get into play?
[02:37:58.667 --> 02:38:04.591]  How is the media able to just lie and mislead the people?
[02:38:04.591 --> 02:38:06.592]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:38:06.592 --> 02:38:07.613]  We need to stand up.
[02:38:08.794 --> 02:38:14.619]  And why are we allowing people to divide us by race?
[02:38:14.619 --> 02:38:16.180]  By politics?
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:21.645]  And what book isn't written that because I'm black I can't have conservative values?
[02:38:21.645 --> 02:38:23.786]  Or because I've spent time in prison?
[02:38:23.786 --> 02:38:29.471]  Or because I was, what you want to say, a lifetime welfare recipient?
[02:38:29.471 --> 02:38:33.914]  And I learned how to get off of my butt and go start my own business and become financially free.
[02:38:33.914 --> 02:38:35.736]  Who's to say that I can't change my mind?
[02:38:36.838 --> 02:38:40.339]  Why does all black people have to be Democrat?
[02:38:40.339 --> 02:38:44.681]  And if you have conservative values, then you're a white supremacist.
[02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:48.642]  But men can be women, and our children can be transitioned.
[02:38:48.642 --> 02:38:52.164]  America, wake up!
[02:38:52.164 --> 02:38:55.845]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:38:55.845 --> 02:39:04.428]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the Western world.
[02:39:05.353 --> 02:39:12.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.
[02:39:12.019 --> 02:39:15.543]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[02:39:15.543 --> 02:39:17.985]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:39:17.985 --> 02:39:23.290]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWorksStore.com, but only for one more week.
[02:39:23.290 --> 02:39:25.232]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[02:39:25.592 --> 02:39:26.372]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[02:39:26.372 --> 02:39:27.533]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:39:27.533 --> 02:39:28.354]  Trying to move quicker.
[02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:56.011]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:56.011 --> 02:39:56.471]  Welcome.
[02:39:56.471 --> 02:40:01.615]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:40:01.615 --> 02:40:04.997]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[02:40:04.997 --> 02:40:11.462]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:40:11.462 --> 02:40:13.124]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:40:13.124 --> 02:40:17.287]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:40:17.287 --> 02:40:18.728]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:40:19.008 --> 02:40:24.533]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:40:24.533 --> 02:40:25.734]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[02:40:25.734 --> 02:40:27.376]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[02:40:43.391 --> 02:40:49.141]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[02:40:49.141 --> 02:40:50.924]  Because God created this country.
[02:40:53.573 --> 02:41:01.759]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:41:01.759 --> 02:41:10.525]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:41:10.525 --> 02:41:17.489]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:41:17.489 --> 02:41:20.111]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.
[02:41:20.111 --> 02:41:22.553]  They fit almost all types of Androids and iPhones.
[02:41:22.873 --> 02:41:23.033]  I think?
[02:41:42.802 --> 02:41:50.666]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[02:41:50.666 --> 02:41:53.207]  They're 50% off right now at mfulmorestore.com.
[02:41:56.989 --> 02:41:58.250]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:58.651]  Welcome.
[02:41:58.651 --> 02:41:59.091]  Go ahead.
[02:41:59.091 --> 02:42:00.392]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:42:00.392 --> 02:42:00.953]  Good, bro.
[02:42:00.953 --> 02:42:02.053]  Great last caller.
[02:42:02.053 --> 02:42:05.116]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:42:05.116 --> 02:42:10.821]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:42:10.821 --> 02:42:12.963]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone, man.
[02:42:12.963 --> 02:42:13.343]  All right.
[02:42:13.343 --> 02:42:14.604]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:42:14.604 --> 02:42:15.545]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:42:15.545 --> 02:42:15.805]  Go ahead.
[02:42:15.905 --> 02:42:17.446]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:42:17.446 --> 02:42:20.469]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:22.150]  The X Team does wonders.
[02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:23.271]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:42:23.271 --> 02:42:24.472]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:42:24.472 --> 02:42:25.252]  Get off the fence.
[02:42:25.252 --> 02:42:25.933]  Get the product.
[02:42:25.933 --> 02:42:27.334]  Support the info war.
[02:42:27.334 --> 02:42:28.635]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:42:28.635 --> 02:42:29.215]  You're on the air.
[02:42:29.215 --> 02:42:29.856]  Thanks for holding.
[02:42:29.856 --> 02:42:30.216]  Go ahead.
[02:42:30.216 --> 02:42:31.997]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:42:31.997 --> 02:42:32.678]  It's an honor.
[02:42:32.678 --> 02:42:32.978]  Honor.
[02:42:32.978 --> 02:42:33.519]  Talk to you.
[02:42:33.519 --> 02:42:33.879]  Awesome.
[02:42:34.419 --> 02:42:40.324]  Uh, so, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:42:40.324 --> 02:42:44.166]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, uh, and it helps in the bedroom.
[02:42:44.166 --> 02:42:45.748]  So, just number one for a few reasons.
[02:42:45.748 --> 02:42:46.728]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:42:46.728 --> 02:42:48.730]  It's not a joke.
[02:42:48.730 --> 02:42:55.715]  Absolutely.
[02:42:55.715 --> 02:42:58.337]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:11.485 --> 02:43:15.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:43:15.149 --> 02:43:21.675]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:43:24.381 --> 02:43:26.542]  Everybody, we're back once again.
[02:43:26.542 --> 02:43:31.724]  We're talking about some of the most tragic things that are happening here in America.
[02:43:31.724 --> 02:43:34.565]  To me, it's a loss of all common sense.
[02:43:34.565 --> 02:43:44.128]  Before we get into this next clip, make sure that you all pick up a copy of my story, Caught in the Coup, available at AngelaStantonEPK.com.
[02:43:44.628 --> 02:43:53.631]  Find out the truth about what was going on in Trump's White House, not what, you know, the fake news, as he always called it, tried to make us believe.
[02:43:53.631 --> 02:44:01.114]  You guys can pick up that copy at AngelaStantonEPK.com and I'm also on YouTube at the Angela Stanton King Show.
[02:44:01.114 --> 02:44:03.835]  So, common sense used to be a thing, right?
[02:44:03.835 --> 02:44:11.998]  You just used to know right from wrong, regardless of what anybody tried to tell you, regardless of what anybody else decided to teach you, you knew
[02:44:12.913 --> 02:44:13.933]  Right from wrong.
[02:44:13.933 --> 02:44:18.694]  You know that if you jump in the water it could either be shallow or it could be deep.
[02:44:18.694 --> 02:44:19.895]  Those are things that you know.
[02:44:19.895 --> 02:44:22.355]  So you're taking a risk on jumping in the water.
[02:44:22.355 --> 02:44:24.996]  You need to be prepared to swim.
[02:44:24.996 --> 02:44:30.917]  Common sense has gone completely out of the window in Joe Biden's America.
[02:44:30.917 --> 02:44:34.618]  Look at this clip.
[02:44:34.618 --> 02:44:35.498]  Oh I have to put it on here.
[02:44:38.266 --> 02:44:42.948]  The baby has been able to latch, but I've not been able to produce any milk.
[02:44:42.948 --> 02:44:50.992]  But it's okay, because we're going to supplement the feeding with formula so that my baby is still getting the nutrients that they need.
[02:44:50.992 --> 02:44:53.353]  But I'm still feeling hopeful.
[02:44:53.353 --> 02:44:56.175]  I appreciate you so much for all your work.
[02:44:56.175 --> 02:44:57.555]  And I appreciate you also, baby.
[02:44:57.555 --> 02:44:59.736]  I couldn't have done it without you.
[02:45:04.113 --> 02:45:21.463]  Let's talk about this for a minute, America, because what you just witnessed in that clip, you just saw the woman who was the one that had the beard and the red hair on the right with the scar under her breast that actually cut her breast off to transition to a man.
[02:45:21.463 --> 02:45:25.385]  The one with the glasses has given birth to the baby.
[02:45:25.385 --> 02:45:31.469]  The man is now transitioning to the mother and has the baby
[02:45:32.654 --> 02:45:34.014]  Sucking on his breast.
[02:45:34.014 --> 02:45:38.256]  Listen to what's happening in Joe Biden's America.
[02:45:38.256 --> 02:45:45.818]  The man is saying, the baby has been able to latch on, but I can't produce any milk.
[02:45:45.818 --> 02:45:53.981]  Now, I know the Democrats say that we're supposed to support science, but where the hell is science and where the hell is common sense?
[02:45:53.981 --> 02:46:01.643]  The woman who had the breast that actually produced the milk, dismembered her breast, removed them,
[02:46:02.665 --> 02:46:11.851]  And now the man has the baby sucking on a male titty that cannot produce milk.
[02:46:11.851 --> 02:46:14.513]  And you are telling me that this is normal?
[02:46:15.208 --> 02:46:19.071]  This is no offense to anybody in the LGBTQ community.
[02:46:19.071 --> 02:46:22.753]  And there are many people that stand with me that say, Angela, you know what?
[02:46:22.753 --> 02:46:24.114]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:24.114 --> 02:46:25.395]  This is going too far.
[02:46:25.395 --> 02:46:27.216]  This is not what we represent.
[02:46:27.216 --> 02:46:29.077]  Is anyone thinking about the children?
[02:46:29.077 --> 02:46:36.242]  What is the purpose of the baby sucking on the man's nipple if he does not
[02:46:37.017 --> 02:46:37.977]  Produce milk.
[02:46:37.977 --> 02:46:42.299]  If you ask me, those are definitely signs of pedophilic behavior.
[02:46:42.299 --> 02:46:46.140]  But of course, once again, this is Joe Biden's America.
[02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:48.561]  This is what's in our school system.
[02:46:48.561 --> 02:46:50.481]  This is what's in our Equality Act.
[02:46:50.481 --> 02:46:54.543]  And this is what's coming down the pipeline for our children.
[02:46:54.543 --> 02:46:57.423]  So let's get on to another very important subject.
[02:46:57.423 --> 02:46:58.904]  We're hearing it all over the news.
[02:46:59.628 --> 02:47:00.689]  Coronavirus.
[02:47:00.689 --> 02:47:04.211]  They're saying that there's another variant on the way.
[02:47:04.211 --> 02:47:06.553]  They're pushing vaccines.
[02:47:06.553 --> 02:47:19.662]  You know, Joe Biden, his administration has decided to go door-to-door to make sure that the unvaccinated are vaccinated because they're saying that the unvaccinated are going to infect the vaccinated.
[02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:23.865]  Now, this is my question and I'm not the brightest person in the world.
[02:47:24.522 --> 02:47:32.587]  And I was just talking to my dad because we were planning on having our family reunion at the end of this month and they wanted to know who was all vaccinated and who was not.
[02:47:32.587 --> 02:47:34.648]  So they're afraid and they may cancel.
[02:47:34.648 --> 02:47:40.412]  I said, but dad, I said, if, if you've already taken your vaccine, your shot, I say, then you're protected.
[02:47:40.412 --> 02:47:42.854]  I said, why are you worried about me?
[02:47:42.854 --> 02:47:49.518]  If you're taking, if you've already taken the shot, that's supposed to protect you from getting it.
[02:47:50.310 --> 02:47:54.312]  Then why are you worried about the people that have it?
[02:47:54.312 --> 02:48:02.657]  And if you've already taken a shot that's supposed to protect you from getting it, um, why do you have to still wear a mask?
[02:48:02.657 --> 02:48:06.079]  I mean, this whole thing is a little confusing to me.
[02:48:06.079 --> 02:48:17.266]  You know, it seems to me, I saw a clip one time of, you know, some Hollywood celebrities saying that they had to do anything that they could to get Trump out of office, even if it was shutting down the economy.
[02:48:17.266 --> 02:48:17.626]  To me,
[02:48:18.869 --> 02:48:22.431]  I think it's all a plot and a plan to just get Trump out of office.
[02:48:22.431 --> 02:48:33.516]  I'm not saying that COVID wasn't real and there aren't evil people in the world that created some type of, you know, disease that would spread and kill people because people are just that evil.
[02:48:33.516 --> 02:48:45.761]  If they're aborting full term babies, harvesting their organs, I don't know any woman has ever had an abortion that said, hey, let me have my baby's remains or walked out of a clinic with their baby.
[02:48:47.757 --> 02:48:51.019]  Where are those bodies going?
[02:48:51.019 --> 02:48:58.483]  Those fresh hearts, those fresh livers, those fresh brains, all those fresh cells.
[02:48:58.483 --> 02:49:01.105]  I think that America, again, like I said,
[02:49:01.846 --> 02:49:03.267]  We have to wake up.
[02:49:03.267 --> 02:49:06.610]  It's just too much going on and censorship is a very big thing.
[02:49:06.610 --> 02:49:21.544]  So listen, I'm excited about what Alex Jones and the rest of the staff are doing here at InfoWars because I've learned that not only was Maj Trey on the show, but Risa Islam is also coming on the show later this week.
[02:49:21.544 --> 02:49:24.527]  That's a brother of mine that I work with in the community.
[02:49:24.527 --> 02:49:27.730]  One of the things that we realize is we're no longer going to be separated.
[02:49:28.351 --> 02:49:30.033]  We're not going to be separated by political parties.
[02:49:30.033 --> 02:49:32.335]  We're not going to be separated by race.
[02:49:32.335 --> 02:49:35.117]  We're not going to be separated by religion.
[02:49:35.117 --> 02:49:37.980]  And we're not going to be separated by sexuality.
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:43.004]  The only thing that's going to separate us is good and evil.
[02:49:43.004 --> 02:49:48.910]  You don't have to have a certain amount of money or be a certain religion to know what's right and what's wrong.
[02:49:51.005 --> 02:49:52.026]  Everybody gets that.
[02:49:52.026 --> 02:49:53.987]  There's good and bad in every race.
[02:49:53.987 --> 02:49:56.129]  There's good and bad in every religion.
[02:49:56.129 --> 02:49:59.831]  There's good and bad in every economic status, right?
[02:49:59.831 --> 02:50:11.760]  So when we're speaking about these things like the pedophilia that's creeping its way down through the LGBTQ community and that movement, we're not attacking everyone in that community.
[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:16.603]  We're saying, hey, even if you're in that community, speak out against this.
[02:50:18.351 --> 02:50:21.292]  We know that pedophilia is a real thing.
[02:50:21.292 --> 02:50:25.793]  You know, back in the day when we were younger, you know, they just said it was child molestation.
[02:50:25.793 --> 02:50:31.134]  There have been predators for children for a very long time.
[02:50:31.134 --> 02:50:35.515]  Let's not act like this is something new.
[02:50:35.515 --> 02:50:38.495]  We need to start showing up to our schools.
[02:50:38.495 --> 02:50:41.236]  We need to start showing up to our capitals.
[02:50:41.934 --> 02:50:50.841]  We need to start demanding that our people in Congress and our state legislators protect the innocence of our children.
[02:50:50.841 --> 02:50:57.466]  Why are we allowing them to be sexualized?
[02:50:57.466 --> 02:50:59.988]  How can you explain it?
[02:50:59.988 --> 02:51:02.811]  How can you explain this choir
[02:51:03.616 --> 02:51:08.238]  Over 60 men saying, hey, we're going to convert your children.
[02:51:08.238 --> 02:51:11.939]  I don't know anybody of any type of sexuality that had to be converted.
[02:51:11.939 --> 02:51:14.481]  I mean, we all grew up, we were all kids.
[02:51:14.481 --> 02:51:15.461]  You figured it out.
[02:51:15.461 --> 02:51:19.583]  It takes time to develop your personality.
[02:51:19.583 --> 02:51:25.925]  This whole war against our children is psychological.
[02:51:25.925 --> 02:51:32.448]  The rainbow, the bright colors, any teacher, any parent, any counselor,
[02:51:33.431 --> 02:51:37.992]  You know that children are attracted to bright colors.
[02:51:37.992 --> 02:51:43.653]  How many cartoons have they made to entertain children that use bright colors?
[02:51:43.653 --> 02:51:44.654]  How many videos?
[02:51:44.654 --> 02:51:46.554]  How many toys?
[02:51:46.554 --> 02:51:48.414]  How many educational seminars?
[02:51:48.414 --> 02:51:55.096]  Everything you see represents a rainbow.
[02:51:55.096 --> 02:51:55.596]  Look at this.
[02:51:58.041 --> 02:52:01.343]  This is happening right before our eyes.
[02:52:01.343 --> 02:52:10.369]  Why does a child need to know what an adult prefers sexually?
[02:52:10.369 --> 02:52:14.051]  How is that on the front line?
[02:52:14.051 --> 02:52:18.173]  When we were kids, we were just trying to figure out how do we spell our name?
[02:52:18.173 --> 02:52:22.036]  How do we color inside of a straight line?
[02:52:22.036 --> 02:52:25.618]  How do we finish a complete sentence?
[02:52:25.618 --> 02:52:26.979]  Let alone trying to figure out
[02:52:27.921 --> 02:52:30.922]  What we had in our pants.
[02:52:30.922 --> 02:52:35.123]  Or how to use it.
[02:52:35.123 --> 02:52:40.924]  Most of the drag queens that I see entertaining children, they look like cartoon characters.
[02:52:40.924 --> 02:52:51.387]  And another thing, with this clip that's playing right here, has anybody paid attention to that the front runners of this movement are always brown or black?
[02:52:51.387 --> 02:52:52.567]  Even with the flag.
[02:52:54.133 --> 02:52:56.533]  They added the black and brown stripes.
[02:52:56.533 --> 02:53:03.175]  How did sexuality all of a sudden tie to a minority?
[02:53:03.175 --> 02:53:07.736]  Why are people being defined by their sexual preference?
[02:53:07.736 --> 02:53:10.476]  When I meet you, I don't need to know that you're gay.
[02:53:10.476 --> 02:53:12.216]  I don't even need to know that you're straight.
[02:53:12.216 --> 02:53:16.757]  Tell me your name, what type of business you're in, and how we can work together, and I'm good.
[02:53:16.757 --> 02:53:20.818]  What you do in your bedroom is not my concern.
[02:53:23.308 --> 02:53:26.311]  Let's get back to common sense America.
[02:53:26.311 --> 02:53:28.413]  Let's go against censorship.
[02:53:28.413 --> 02:53:31.517]  Let's go against the sexual perversion of our children.
[02:53:31.517 --> 02:53:34.059]  And let's stop being blinded by fake news.
[02:53:34.059 --> 02:53:35.441]  I've enjoyed it today.
[02:53:35.441 --> 02:53:37.783]  Angela Stanton King, I'm Angela Stanton, EPK.com.
[02:53:42.646 --> 02:53:44.949]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena.
[02:53:44.949 --> 02:53:47.373]  A man under Teddy Roosevelt's own heart.
[02:53:47.373 --> 02:53:51.358]  People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right.
[02:53:51.358 --> 02:53:57.487]  The audits are coming out and there was total, absolute election fraud against President Trump and against the American people.
[02:53:57.487 --> 02:53:57.928]  That is
[02:53:58.508 --> 02:53:59.869]  The bottom line.
[02:53:59.869 --> 02:54:05.873]  And Mike Lindell is getting sued by all these big powerful globalist institutions trying to shut him down.
[02:54:05.873 --> 02:54:14.539]  That's why it's so important to support MyPillow.com and all the great products he's got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America.
[02:54:14.539 --> 02:54:16.740]  Because he's doing God's work.
[02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:19.002]  And at the same time, he's funding InfoWars.
[02:54:19.002 --> 02:54:19.522]  That's right.
[02:54:19.522 --> 02:54:20.983]  When you use promo code Alex,
[02:54:21.523 --> 02:54:31.350]  And check out, up to 60% off on the best selling sheets, and towels, and the new beds he's got, and the pillows of course, everything.

[02:54:33.872 --> 02:54:35.733]  And check out at MyPillow.com.
[02:54:35.733 --> 02:54:38.635]  You'll find his great work and our great work at InfoWars.
[02:54:38.635 --> 02:54:39.716]  A 360 win.
[02:54:39.716 --> 02:54:41.057]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[02:54:43.027 --> 02:54:46.710]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:55.278]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[02:54:56.207 --> 02:55:02.873]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.
[02:55:02.873 --> 02:55:06.416]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[02:55:06.416 --> 02:55:08.838]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:08.838 --> 02:55:14.143]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWareStore.com, but only for one more week.
[02:55:14.143 --> 02:55:16.085]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[02:55:16.605 --> 02:55:17.625]  But that's it.
[02:55:17.625 --> 02:55:20.026]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[02:55:20.026 --> 02:55:22.246]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[02:55:22.246 --> 02:55:24.226]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:55:24.226 --> 02:55:25.467]  It's the highest quality.
[02:55:25.467 --> 02:55:26.687]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[02:55:26.687 --> 02:55:28.387]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[02:55:28.387 --> 02:55:34.808]  All ready for you at InfoWareStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[02:55:36.649 --> 02:55:38.449]  10% off on high-quality, storable food.
[02:55:38.449 --> 02:55:39.249]  Ready to ship.
[02:55:39.249 --> 02:55:41.030]  But it ends in just one week.
[02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.690]  So take action now while you still can.
[02:55:46.790 --> 02:56:02.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:02.505 --> 02:56:05.228]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:56:05.228 --> 02:56:10.272]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:56:18.064 --> 02:56:28.992]  Because a select few are addicted to the narcotic of power, like hopeless opium junkies, the new normal dictates that freedom must be relegated to the dustbin of history.
[02:56:28.992 --> 02:56:31.614]  But it isn't merely a temporary tyranny.
[02:56:31.614 --> 02:56:47.867]  These lunatics are driving humanity towards the endgame implementation of the biometric ID enslavement plan, war-gamed 11 years ago by the Rockefeller Foundation's Operation Lockstep, which has almost completely unfolded as it was written.
[02:56:48.127 --> 02:56:56.810]  The implementation of a full-blown biometric ID system won't merely address the fears and control of the COVID cult.
[02:56:56.810 --> 02:56:59.451]  How much control of information should there be?
[02:56:59.451 --> 02:57:00.911]  And by whom?
[02:57:00.911 --> 02:57:04.692]  And how can false information be effectively challenged?
[02:57:04.692 --> 02:57:09.254]  And what if that false information is coming from companies or from governments?
[02:57:09.254 --> 02:57:12.695]  We're at a moment where the social media platforms have to
[02:57:13.650 --> 02:57:21.573]  Step forward and recognize the moment to assert that they're a technology platform and not a broadcaster is over.
[02:57:21.573 --> 02:57:28.836]  They in fact have to be a participant in broadcasting accurate information and partnering with the scientific and health communities to
[02:57:30.217 --> 02:57:34.319]  Counterweight, if not flood the zone, of accurate information.
[02:57:34.319 --> 02:57:40.142]  Because to put the genie back in the bottle of the misinformation and disinformation is nigh impossible.
[02:57:40.142 --> 02:57:50.428]  One thing we haven't spoken about, and I'm wondering whether it's time to talk about this, is a step up from the part of the government on enforcement actions against fake news.
[02:57:50.428 --> 02:57:52.089]  This is an enormous task.
[02:57:53.340 --> 02:58:00.305]  The fingerprints and eye scans of every Indian in the country are being taken and collated into an online database.
[02:58:02.077 --> 02:58:06.920]  When complete, everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number.
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:11.642]  It'll enable them to access India's vast and unwieldy welfare states.
[02:58:11.642 --> 02:58:23.628]  It will enslave humanity in other levels of technocracy, including a functional MRI scanner at airports and public places to detect abnormal behavior and anti-social intent.
[02:58:23.628 --> 02:58:30.412]  A cheaper, lower-bandwidth telepresence technology that serves those who are under permanent lockdown.
[02:58:30.772 --> 02:58:40.157]  Eventually, a China-style firewall will fracture the Internet as it is driven by protectionism and national security concerns.
[02:58:40.157 --> 02:58:50.222]  Biometric systems can recognize a person's specific physical attributes, their fingerprints, facial features, iris, or retina.
[02:58:50.222 --> 02:58:59.066]  The technology is already used around the world by the Somali army, Indian doctors, and for authenticating patients for important drugs.
[02:59:00.035 --> 02:59:03.817]  Or for online banking on smartphones.
[02:59:03.817 --> 02:59:07.499]  There are even systems that look under your skin, so to speak.
[02:59:07.499 --> 02:59:11.221]  Such as infrared scanners that are used in vein matching.
[02:59:11.221 --> 02:59:18.686]  Oxygen-poor blood in veins absorbs more infrared light than surrounding tissue, so that vein patterns can be matched.
[02:59:18.686 --> 02:59:23.588]  You know, I was a lab technician myself.
[02:59:23.588 --> 02:59:26.490]  I'm immunologist, and I have worked in the lab.
[02:59:27.578 --> 02:59:30.461]  And lab accidents happen.
[02:59:30.461 --> 02:59:31.641]  It's common.
[02:59:31.641 --> 02:59:55.261]  It is vital that we determine without question that the coronavirus is absolutely a biological weapon released by the Communist Chinese government, who appear at the center of Operation Lockstep as the totalitarian heroes they were made out to be in 2020, just as they were depicted by the Rockefeller Foundation 11 years earlier in Operation Lockstep.
[02:59:55.661 --> 03:00:02.986]  Our government has become powerless at wielding justice against the corruption, tightening its grip on the levers of control.
[03:00:02.986 --> 03:00:11.711]  That we openly live in a system that if an individual plans a murder, they are charged with premeditated murder in the first degree.
[03:00:11.711 --> 03:00:15.474]  But if globalist think tanks in league with the United Nations
[03:00:15.834 --> 03:00:28.342]  And the Communist Chinese government literally print a document with the intent of the advancement of genocide and technocratic tyranny on a global scale that actually comes to pass.
[03:00:28.342 --> 03:00:31.644]  Well then, it's just business as usual.
[03:00:31.644 --> 03:00:32.865]  John Bowne reporting.
[03:00:33.285 --> 03:00:37.870]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[03:00:37.870 --> 03:00:39.872]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:39.872 --> 03:00:43.315]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreier.
[03:00:43.315 --> 03:00:47.479]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:00:51.019 --> 03:00:59.525]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:59.525 --> 03:01:10.113]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:01:10.113 --> 03:01:13.035]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[03:01:13.035 --> 03:01:13.616]  Listen to this.
[03:01:14.196 --> 03:01:15.437]  Organic pea fiber.
[03:01:15.437 --> 03:01:16.898]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[03:01:16.898 --> 03:01:18.338]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[03:01:18.338 --> 03:01:19.799]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[03:01:19.799 --> 03:01:21.200]  Organic kale leaf.
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:22.761]  Organic flax sprout.
[03:01:22.761 --> 03:01:24.361]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[03:01:24.361 --> 03:01:27.803]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[03:01:27.803 --> 03:01:29.084]  Just one of these ingredients
[03:01:29.344 --> 03:01:36.408]  Can be a life-changing supplement for your health and we packed it all in to fiber green caps at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:01:36.408 --> 03:01:40.290]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[03:01:40.290 --> 03:01:45.313]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[03:01:45.313 --> 03:01:46.833]  That's 33% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:02:07.249 --> 03:02:28.659]  Real live it is, the Summit News Hour, and I'm going to cover a news story that just broke about an hour ago, probably in the next segment, where the top health official in Australia is now literally telling people in Australia that they can't have conversations with each other because they found one new COVID case in that area of Australia.
[03:02:29.503 --> 03:02:37.465]  In New South Wales, but I'm going to get into that later because of course we celebrated Freedom Day here in London, here in the UK yesterday.
[03:02:37.465 --> 03:02:49.668]  When all coronavirus restrictions were supposed to be lifted, the Freedom Day protesters, the actual freedom protesters, went out onto the streets once again and they celebrated their freedom.
[03:02:49.668 --> 03:02:53.469]  They were able to respect, embrace, embody and communicate their freedom.
[03:02:54.238 --> 03:03:02.162]  By having seven shades of hell beaten out of them by the police, because we're so free.
[03:03:02.162 --> 03:03:22.772]  Of course, we have a situation now whereby even though these restrictions have been lifted, I would say from personal experience, just from walking around today, despite the fact that there's no law that says you have to wear a mask in a shop, in most other places, I think only airports are the ones who actually can legally enforce it, but maybe not even them.
[03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:26.694]  80% of people are still wearing the masks.
[03:03:26.694 --> 03:03:30.617]  We had the hottest day so far this year in the UK yesterday.
[03:03:30.617 --> 03:03:32.778]  Today is almost as hot.
[03:03:32.778 --> 03:03:36.101]  People still wearing masks outside.
[03:03:36.101 --> 03:03:44.647]  People literally sat down outside with no one else around them, eating their lunch and then putting the mask back on in between bites.
[03:03:44.647 --> 03:03:52.192]  People queuing up, again with no one around them, two or three people in a queue, to eat at an outdoor restaurant
[03:03:52.961 --> 03:04:07.994]  Wearing their masks from the point where you meet the person at the front desk of the restaurant to where you sit down ten yards away, outside the entire time, but wearing their masks when they stand there to book their table.
[03:04:08.681 --> 03:04:10.863]  Why is everyone so petrified?
[03:04:10.863 --> 03:04:13.164]  Why is everyone so brainwashed?
[03:04:13.164 --> 03:04:15.345]  Why does this have a lasting effect?
[03:04:15.345 --> 03:04:16.706]  Well, it's not just a cliche.
[03:04:16.706 --> 03:04:20.489]  It was a deliberate military psyops operation.
[03:04:20.489 --> 03:04:21.710]  We have the documents on it.
[03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:22.530]  They've all come out.
[03:04:22.530 --> 03:04:29.235]  Of course, the vast majority of the British population don't know this, but we know why they're so cowed, why they're so
[03:04:30.456 --> 03:04:44.911]  Jellyfish-like in their complete subservience and total compliance to these mandates, which even though the government says they now don't have to comply with in a number of cases, they're doing so of their own accord because they've been so terrified.
[03:04:44.911 --> 03:04:50.277]  Because they were given a completely false picture of the lethality of this virus from the very beginning.
[03:04:50.277 --> 03:04:51.959]  There's a book called
[03:04:52.808 --> 03:04:57.729]  A State of Fear by Laura Dodsworth, which has made waves here in the UK.
[03:04:57.729 --> 03:05:18.593]  And she got the documents proving that at the start of the pandemic, the government made a conscious decision to shift from handling the outbreak of this pandemic via the textbook basis of how they would handle all historical pandemics before it, which is to protect the vulnerable and then allow everyone else to go about their lives in order to achieve herd immunity.
[03:05:18.593 --> 03:05:21.054]  That was how we dealt with every other major pandemic in the past.
[03:05:21.966 --> 03:05:41.549]  But they made a rapid decision to do a U-turn on that in the early days of the pandemic, right before the lockdown was announced here in the United Kingdom towards the end of March 2020, when they literally allowed behavioural scientists, not virologists, not medical scientists, behavioural scientists
[03:05:42.069 --> 03:05:53.455]  GCHQ and the British military to take over the task of informing the population of how they should respond to the pandemic.
[03:05:53.455 --> 03:05:58.338]  Of course, by informing, they literally mean brainwashing and mind control.
[03:05:58.338 --> 03:06:08.543]  Totalitarian, unethical methods of brainwashing and mind control, which they themselves admitted to Laura Dodsworth, the author who published this book,
[03:06:09.548 --> 03:06:13.231]  This was the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviors.
[03:06:13.231 --> 03:06:20.016]  Again, behavioral scientists weaponizing their trade to kowtow people into being terrified of the virus.
[03:06:20.016 --> 03:06:30.884]  And they did so because they thought that many people, quote, still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened, and that the perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased.
[03:06:30.884 --> 03:06:35.508]  Because that's the only way they thought people would comply with any of these mandates whatsoever.
[03:06:36.505 --> 03:06:50.281]  Which is completely wrong, by the way, because most people were complying with the social distancing and the handwashing for weeks and maybe even more than a month before the lockdown was brought into legal force.
[03:06:50.281 --> 03:06:55.067]  So we have the behavioral scientists on the SAGE committee, who again aren't medical scientists,
[03:06:55.709 --> 03:07:05.053]  Telling the government that they need to use totalitarian, unethical propaganda brainwashing methods, lie to the public in order to make them terrified, to make them more compliant.
[03:07:05.053 --> 03:07:07.554]  That's exactly what happened.
[03:07:07.554 --> 03:07:15.058]  She also writes, and this is covered in the article out of the Telegraph, Life Inside the Fear Factory, Government Keeps Us on High Alert.
[03:07:15.058 --> 03:07:16.218]  She also writes about the RICU.
[03:07:18.090 --> 03:07:31.839]  Which is the Home Office, the British Government's research, information and communications unit, which attempts to covertly engineer the thoughts of people by providing to support to bodies seen by the public as grassroots organisations.
[03:07:31.839 --> 03:07:36.222]  So it's about all these committees that aren't actually officially government bodies,
[03:07:36.883 --> 03:07:49.736]  They're just liaising with the government and then they've got their fingers in the pie of all these other influencers, cultural groups, celebrities and people like that, who they then use to propagandize the public even more.
[03:07:49.736 --> 03:07:58.745]  She also writes of another group, the Rapid Response Unit, based in number 10 Downing Street, and the Counter Disinformation Cell,
[03:07:59.508 --> 03:08:02.411]  ...attached to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
[03:08:02.411 --> 03:08:09.378]  Again, it's attached, it's not explicitly government, which means they can get away with doing more things, but they're basically telling the government what to do.
[03:08:10.450 --> 03:08:27.445]  Both of which monitor social media and tackle fake news, including, Doddsworth claims, YouTube videos by doctors who contradict WHO guidance on COVID, despite the fact that the WHO itself, in its own advice, contradicted itself on COVID innumerable times.
[03:08:27.445 --> 03:08:35.212]  They said there was no human-to-human transmission of COVID on January 14th because the Communist Chinese government told them, and we can trust them, right?
[03:08:36.132 --> 03:08:40.154]  So again, it's all these subgroups that aren't even government entities.
[03:08:40.154 --> 03:08:44.336]  Slimy, shadowy groups that have basically seized control of the government.
[03:08:44.336 --> 03:08:53.660]  And you know that because of what came out yesterday from what the Prime Minister Boris Johnson was saying at the start of this lockdown.
[03:08:53.660 --> 03:09:00.224]  Which was the quote, this was October, but this came out, of course he said it back in March.
[03:09:00.224 --> 03:09:03.065]  But then it's just been released today, publicly, or yesterday.
[03:09:04.272 --> 03:09:09.455]  He says, I must say, remember this is Boris Johnson at the start of the pandemic, before lockdown.
[03:09:09.455 --> 03:09:13.638]  I must say I've been slightly rocked by some of the data on COVID totalities.
[03:09:13.638 --> 03:09:19.741]  The median age of death is 82, 81 for men, 85 for women.
[03:09:19.741 --> 03:09:24.564]  That's above life expectancy, so get COVID and live longer.
[03:09:24.564 --> 03:09:31.208]  This is what Dominic Cummings, who was in number 10 Downing Street, says Boris Johnson said about the pandemic at its origin.
[03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:39.194]  He said hardly anyone under 60 goes into hospital 4% and all of those virtually all survive.
[03:09:39.194 --> 03:09:43.076]  And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff.
[03:09:43.076 --> 03:09:44.918]  I think we may need to recalibrate.
[03:09:44.918 --> 03:09:58.986]  That's Boris Johnson admitting that the lockdown strategy was a complete failure because the average age of death was 82 and above and when somebody did a Freedom of Information Act request to the UK government
[03:09:59.798 --> 03:10:10.784]  They asked them the question, how many of these deaths in the official COVID death toll figure of the UK are from COVID alone, with no comorbidities?
[03:10:10.784 --> 03:10:15.527]  And they got an answer, and it's still on the government official website, Office of National Statistics.
[03:10:15.527 --> 03:10:16.588]  I'm looking at it right now.
[03:10:17.799 --> 03:10:27.045]  The UK government admits 8.9% of the COVID death toll died solely of COVID with no other comorbidities.
[03:10:27.045 --> 03:10:34.050]  So the official true death toll figure is less than one tenth of what they're telling the public it is.
[03:10:34.050 --> 03:10:41.976]  So is there any surprise that people are still so terrified they're still wearing masks even though they're not legally obliged to?
[03:10:41.976 --> 03:10:45.158]  Is there any surprise that we had a poll last year, last summer indeed,
[03:10:46.104 --> 03:10:52.026]  Which found that the average Brit thought coronavirus was 100 times more deadly than it actually is.
[03:10:52.026 --> 03:10:59.908]  They thought six to seven percent of the population, this was a year ago, had died of COVID-19.
[03:10:59.908 --> 03:11:09.570]  Again, it was not only a hundred times less, it was one-tenth the official figure they told us was actually those who had died of COVID without any comorbidities.
[03:11:10.529 --> 03:11:12.732]  That's why people are still wearing masks.
[03:11:12.732 --> 03:11:16.257]  That's why they're still walking around with terrified looks on their faces.
[03:11:16.257 --> 03:11:25.169]  And that's why they support vaccine passports, which are now going to expand into every area of society as we increasingly devolve into a
[03:11:25.689 --> 03:11:33.533]  Communist Chinese style social credit score, biosecurity, police state, and that's what I'm going to get into on the other side.
[03:11:33.533 --> 03:11:40.136]  They're now saying people attend football matches, people who want to go to nightclubs, people who want to go to crowded venues.
[03:11:40.136 --> 03:11:43.017]  It just keeps expanding further and further.
[03:11:43.017 --> 03:11:43.918]  This is Summit News.
[03:11:43.918 --> 03:11:45.518]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:11:45.518 --> 03:11:46.099]  Don't go away.
[03:11:53.198 --> 03:11:54.459]  Jacob in Ohio.
[03:11:54.459 --> 03:11:54.840]  Welcome.
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:11:55.300]  Go ahead.
[03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:56.762]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:11:56.762 --> 03:11:58.263]  Great last caller.
[03:11:58.263 --> 03:12:01.326]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[03:12:01.326 --> 03:12:07.031]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[03:12:07.031 --> 03:12:09.153]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[03:12:09.153 --> 03:12:10.835]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire.
[03:12:10.835 --> 03:12:11.756]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[03:12:11.756 --> 03:12:11.996]  Go ahead.
[03:12:12.116 --> 03:12:13.657]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:12:13.657 --> 03:12:16.679]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[03:12:16.679 --> 03:12:18.360]  The X-Tune does wonders.
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:20.682]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[03:12:20.682 --> 03:12:23.544]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info war.
[03:12:23.544 --> 03:12:24.845]  Tyler in Maine.
[03:12:24.845 --> 03:12:25.425]  You're on the air.
[03:12:25.425 --> 03:12:26.066]  Thanks for rolling.
[03:12:26.066 --> 03:12:26.426]  Go ahead.
[03:12:26.426 --> 03:12:28.147]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[03:12:28.147 --> 03:12:28.708]  It's an honor.
[03:12:29.048 --> 03:12:30.629]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[03:12:30.629 --> 03:12:31.069]  Awesome.
[03:12:31.069 --> 03:12:34.451]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[03:12:34.451 --> 03:12:36.272]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[03:12:36.272 --> 03:12:39.014]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:40.375]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[03:12:40.375 --> 03:12:41.956]  So, just number one for a few reasons.
[03:12:41.956 --> 03:12:43.036]  Well, it definitely works.
[03:12:43.036 --> 03:12:44.657]  It's not a joke.
[03:12:44.657 --> 03:12:45.398]  Absolutely.
[03:12:50.092 --> 03:12:53.775]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[03:12:53.775 --> 03:13:02.343]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[03:13:03.274 --> 03:13:09.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.
[03:13:09.940 --> 03:13:13.484]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[03:13:13.484 --> 03:13:15.906]  Their entire catalog is at InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:13:15.906 --> 03:13:21.211]  You get an additional 10% off at InfoWorksStore.com, but only for one more week.
[03:13:21.211 --> 03:13:23.153]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[03:13:23.653 --> 03:13:24.694]  But that's it.
[03:13:24.694 --> 03:13:27.095]  They won't do the sale again until November.
[03:13:27.095 --> 03:13:29.297]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[03:13:29.297 --> 03:13:31.298]  This is insurance you can eat.
[03:13:31.298 --> 03:13:32.559]  It's the highest quality.
[03:13:32.559 --> 03:13:33.740]  Hundreds of high-quality foods.
[03:13:33.740 --> 03:13:35.441]  Three-month, six-month year supplies.
[03:13:35.441 --> 03:13:41.865]  All ready for you at InfoWareStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:13:41.865 --> 03:13:44.067]  Again, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:13:44.067 --> 03:13:45.508]  10% off on high-quality, storable food.
[03:13:45.508 --> 03:13:46.309]  Ready to ship.
[03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:48.090]  But it ends in just one week.
[03:13:48.090 --> 03:13:49.751]  So take action now while you still can.
[03:13:52.976 --> 03:14:03.124]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:14:03.124 --> 03:14:12.712]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:15.692 --> 03:14:24.202]  So in her book, A State of Fear, Laura Dodsworth documents how there are behavioural insight teams operating within at least ten government departments.
[03:14:24.202 --> 03:14:33.293]  Again, these aren't official government bodies, they're quasi-government, quasi-private bodies, who are tasked with manipulating and propagandising the British public.
[03:14:34.224 --> 03:14:49.532]  We also literally have the UK Army, the British Army, which is only supposed to focus propaganda campaigns to foreign adversaries being turned inwards on the UK population at the start of this pandemic.
[03:14:49.532 --> 03:14:53.814]  Again, this is out the article inside the fear factory out of the Telegraph.
[03:14:53.814 --> 03:14:55.215]  She says, some people believe
[03:14:56.187 --> 03:15:11.230]  And oh, you can believe it if you've seen the thread responses on Twitter where it's the announcement of a new lockdown policy, then below it, word for word, different bot accounts copying the same copy-paste-a-thing where it says, oh, this isn't enough lockdown.
[03:15:11.230 --> 03:15:12.610]  We need more strict lockdowns.
[03:15:12.610 --> 03:15:14.311]  We need it for another year.
[03:15:14.311 --> 03:15:18.912]  Exactly the same text to flood the comments, to flood these Twitter threads.
[03:15:18.912 --> 03:15:20.312]  It's bots doing it.
[03:15:20.312 --> 03:15:22.373]  China's done that for over a decade.
[03:15:22.373 --> 03:15:24.493]  They literally hire millions of people
[03:15:25.211 --> 03:15:34.234]  To manipulate public opinion and to create fake consensus on social media by amplifying Chinese government propaganda narratives.
[03:15:34.234 --> 03:15:42.837]  And now because apparently China's great and we're aping and mimicking everything they do because authoritarian tyranny is so cool now, we get that done to us.
[03:15:43.815 --> 03:16:02.405]  And it was the British military and these other behavioral insight groups who have infested our government that literally took that fake Chinese propaganda of the video footage of people convulsing and collapsing on the street before the lockdowns in the West were implemented, again to terrify the public into going along with it.
[03:16:02.945 --> 03:16:10.591]  Despite the fact we know they were completely faked, convulsing and collapsing and falling down on the street has never been a symptom of Covid.
[03:16:10.591 --> 03:16:11.992]  It wasn't then, it isn't now.
[03:16:11.992 --> 03:16:28.346]  It was completely faked, it was a complete hoax, amplified by the media, amplified by the likes of this 77th Brigade, which is literally the British military propagandizing its own people when it's supposed to be focusing its direction out to foreign adversaries.
[03:16:28.346 --> 03:16:31.228]  So she says some people believe they've been targeted by the 77th Brigade.
[03:16:33.214 --> 03:16:44.080]  Part of the 6th Division of the Army, which, according to the Ministry of Defence, uses, quote, legitimate non-military levers as a means to adapt behaviours of the opposing forces and adversaries.
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:54.826]  When she inquired about the activities of some of these bodies, she says, I hit a brick wall, and I find that when someone puts up a brick wall, it's because that's where the real story lies.
[03:16:54.826 --> 03:17:02.570]  Now, another one of these behavioural insight weaponisation of propaganda techniques was centred around the wearing of masks.
[03:17:03.331 --> 03:17:17.442]  Just as we know, at the start of the pandemic, the WHO, every major public health body in developed countries, said masks, non-surgical masks, which is the one that everyone's wearing still, don't do anything to stop COVID.
[03:17:18.351 --> 03:17:23.957]  We've had the best part of a year in the United Kingdom wearing these masks by law.
[03:17:23.957 --> 03:17:26.159]  The case numbers kept going up.
[03:17:26.159 --> 03:17:27.200]  Same thing in Spain.
[03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:34.888]  I was in Spain last summer right after they mandated masks everywhere, literally in 40 degree heat outside having to wear a mask.
[03:17:35.678 --> 03:17:41.803]  And the police in Spain aren't like the Benny Hill bobbies that we have here in the UK.
[03:17:41.803 --> 03:17:47.247]  They're big, butch, tough guys and they will literally pin you down and handcuff you.
[03:17:47.247 --> 03:17:52.210]  We've seen that on many occasions, literally people being beaten up for not wearing masks.
[03:17:52.210 --> 03:17:54.772]  Again, it was all complete baloney propaganda.
[03:17:54.772 --> 03:18:03.619]  Anthony Fauci, in his own emails right back at the start of the pandemic in February, said the masks are completely useless.
[03:18:04.446 --> 03:18:11.409]  Now we have another government advisor, one who actually speaks some sense, going public yesterday.
[03:18:11.409 --> 03:18:17.671]  The headline is, Government Advisor Admits Masks Are Just Comfort Blankets That Do Virtually Nothing.
[03:18:17.671 --> 03:18:31.916]  Making the point, and this is Dr Colin Axon, a SAGE advisor for the government, one who actually wants to get back to normal and not implement these mandates forever, as the hardline communist Susan Michie has said over and over again.
[03:18:33.044 --> 03:18:46.935]  He told the London Telegraph that medics have given people a cartoonish view of how microscopic viruses travel through the air and the masks have gaps in them that are up to 5,000 times bigger than COVID particles.
[03:18:46.935 --> 03:18:52.560]  The particle is 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the fabric of that mask.
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:54.302]  They go straight through.
[03:18:54.302 --> 03:19:00.727]  This is why it's completely cartoonish pantomime nonsense that people wear a mask
[03:19:01.900 --> 03:19:04.702]  For the five-foot walk to their dinner table.
[03:19:04.702 --> 03:19:09.385]  They've been doing that for the past, what, seven months here in the UK at least.
[03:19:09.385 --> 03:19:11.387]  Complete pantomime act.
[03:19:11.387 --> 03:19:13.248]  He made the analogy.
[03:19:13.248 --> 03:19:21.433]  He said the small sizes are not easily understood, but an imperfect analogy would be to imagine marbles fired at a builder's scaffolding.
[03:19:21.433 --> 03:19:24.936]  Some might hit a pole and rebound, but obviously most will fly through.
[03:19:26.064 --> 03:19:30.047]  And these are the great protective devices that we've all been mandated to wear.
[03:19:30.047 --> 03:19:34.551]  These have been used to create yet more division, turmoil, confrontations in society.
[03:19:34.551 --> 03:19:36.573]  Completely useless!
[03:19:36.573 --> 03:19:38.555]  Fauci knew it from the start.
[03:19:38.555 --> 03:19:42.058]  All these behavioural insight manipulators knew it from the start.
[03:19:42.058 --> 03:19:44.800]  But the decision was made.
[03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:49.524]  Right when they introduced all these mask mandates, after previously saying there was no point because they don't do anything.
[03:19:50.211 --> 03:19:55.093]  This isn't about a medical response that's going to stop the spread of the transmission of the virus.
[03:19:55.093 --> 03:20:00.835]  This is about enforcing compliance via coercion.
[03:20:00.835 --> 03:20:08.298]  And they literally said that in the same documents that I talked about previously in regard to the UK and these behavioural insight teams.
[03:20:10.026 --> 03:20:21.909]  Goes on to say, noting the mask debate is about the particle journey, Axon explain that masks can catch droplets and spew them from a cough, which is why people in hospitals wear them when they're doing medical procedures.
[03:20:21.909 --> 03:20:24.530]  But they're wearing different masks entirely.
[03:20:24.530 --> 03:20:29.211]  But what's important is that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly distributed by tiny aerosols.
[03:20:30.037 --> 03:20:33.540]  So the COVID viral particle is around 100 nanometers.
[03:20:33.540 --> 03:20:40.706]  Material gaps in blue surgical masks, which is what most people wear, are up to 1,000 times that size.
[03:20:40.706 --> 03:20:46.691]  Cloth mask gaps can be 500,000 times the size.
[03:20:46.691 --> 03:20:55.579]  So the holes in the masks of what a great majority of people walking around wearing, thinking they're protecting themselves and others and being a good person,
[03:20:56.312 --> 03:20:57.732]  You idiot!
[03:20:57.732 --> 03:21:05.814]  The holes in that stupid face nappy that you're wearing are 500,000 times bigger than the virus particle.
[03:21:05.814 --> 03:21:07.175]  It's all pantomime.
[03:21:07.175 --> 03:21:10.536]  It's all nonsense.
[03:21:10.536 --> 03:21:18.317]  As Fauci admitted in his own emails, the professor noted that those aerosols escape masks and will render the mask ineffective.
[03:21:18.317 --> 03:21:20.258]  And yet still, what do we have today?
[03:21:21.019 --> 03:21:28.202]  Zero Hedge reports, is this why a child doctor's group suddenly demanded all kids over 2 wear masks at school?
[03:21:28.202 --> 03:21:31.304]  Even though they're going to vaccinate them.
[03:21:31.304 --> 03:21:37.666]  Says, in case you wondered why the American Academy of Pediatricians would overrule the CDC's science, consider this.
[03:21:37.666 --> 03:21:42.088]  The American Academy of Pediatrics wants all kids masked until vaccinated.
[03:21:42.088 --> 03:21:45.270]  Let's go to their website and see who the biggest donor is.
[03:21:45.270 --> 03:21:46.910]  Oh look, it's Pfizer!
[03:21:46.910 --> 03:21:47.951]  Well, imagine my shock.
[03:21:48.777 --> 03:21:55.661]  So they're demanding kids over the age of two years old wear the masks, despite knowing that the masks are completely useless.
[03:21:55.661 --> 03:22:03.745]  The virus particle is, in the case of the cloth masks, 500,000 times smaller than the fabric, the hole in the fabric in the mask.
[03:22:04.708 --> 03:22:08.089]  It was never intended to stop the spread of COVID.
[03:22:08.089 --> 03:22:16.551]  The one peer-reviewed study, the one contemporary peer-reviewed study into the efficacy of masks was the Danmask trial study in Denmark.
[03:22:16.551 --> 03:22:18.892]  They took 6,000 participants.
[03:22:18.892 --> 03:22:28.634]  They found that those who wore the mask and those didn't, there was no statistical difference between those who got infected with COVID and those who didn't based on wearing a mask.
[03:22:28.994 --> 03:22:34.638]  And there's no study that exists that proves masks work to any great degree.
[03:22:34.638 --> 03:22:49.530]  It was an exercise in coercing compliance, because they knew if they could get away with that, then they can get away with the next stage, which is vaccine passports, which I'll talk about in the next segment.
[03:22:49.530 --> 03:22:53.853]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic.
[03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:58.562]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly.
[03:22:58.562 --> 03:23:01.904]  For prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[03:23:01.904 --> 03:23:03.365]  And we're all in it together.
[03:23:03.365 --> 03:23:08.728]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:23:08.728 --> 03:23:09.409]  But it's true.
[03:23:09.409 --> 03:23:12.811]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:23:13.571 --> 03:23:16.034]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:23:16.034 --> 03:23:18.117]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:23:18.117 --> 03:23:19.879]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:23:19.879 --> 03:23:20.760]  And we're still here.
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:25.166]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:23:25.166 --> 03:23:26.808]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:23:26.808 --> 03:23:28.951]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:23:28.951 --> 03:23:30.693]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[03:23:31.173 --> 03:23:34.756]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[03:23:57.654 --> 03:24:14.899]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeover is trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[03:24:14.899 --> 03:24:15.660]  Worse than slaves.
[03:24:15.660 --> 03:24:19.701]  They're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[03:24:19.701 --> 03:24:26.523]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[03:24:27.242 --> 03:24:37.267]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[03:24:37.267 --> 03:24:38.488]  It's that choice.
[03:24:38.488 --> 03:24:41.449]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[03:24:41.449 --> 03:24:43.630]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[03:24:43.630 --> 03:24:44.411]  Freedom or slavery.
[03:24:44.411 --> 03:24:45.891]  Good or evil.
[03:24:45.891 --> 03:24:47.212]  It is a spiritual battle.
[03:24:47.212 --> 03:24:48.893]  And M4 war is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[03:24:49.961 --> 03:24:54.302]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:24:54.302 --> 03:25:04.904]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:25:04.904 --> 03:25:11.105]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:25:49.773 --> 03:25:58.281]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:58.281 --> 03:26:08.871]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens fibers and vegetable capsules for a long time, and so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:26:08.871 --> 03:26:11.793]  But then I read the ingredients, and I was blown away.
[03:26:11.793 --> 03:26:12.374]  Listen to this.
[03:26:12.934 --> 03:26:14.196]  Organic pea fiber.
[03:26:14.196 --> 03:26:15.639]  Organic alfalfa leaf.
[03:26:15.639 --> 03:26:17.101]  Organic wheatgrass leaf.
[03:26:17.101 --> 03:26:18.543]  Organic cilantro leaf.
[03:26:18.543 --> 03:26:19.965]  Organic kale leaf.
[03:26:19.965 --> 03:26:21.508]  Organic flax sprout.
[03:26:21.508 --> 03:26:23.130]  Organic quinoa sprout.
[03:26:23.130 --> 03:26:26.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[03:26:26.576 --> 03:26:27.838]  Just one of these ingredients
[03:26:28.078 --> 03:26:29.359]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:27:02.709 --> 03:27:11.512]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:27:11.512 --> 03:27:20.656]  So Australia, from the very beginning, was one of the most authoritarian, draconian countries in the developed world when it came to enforcing these lockdowns.
[03:27:20.656 --> 03:27:30.499]  In fact, I remember writing stories in the early months of the pandemic where they would announce the lockdown on the news and then literally have police and security guards
[03:27:31.423 --> 03:27:36.327]  Standing outside apartment blocks to prevent people from leaving their own apartments.
[03:27:36.327 --> 03:27:48.757]  We had an article and a video from Australia where a woman was arrested for the crime, the egregious crime of organizing an anti... In fact, I don't even think she organized it.
[03:27:48.757 --> 03:27:51.839]  I think she just promoted it on Facebook.
[03:27:51.839 --> 03:28:00.186]  Pregnant woman, the police in Australia showed up to her house, burst into her house and arrested her in front of her husband and her kids.
[03:28:00.891 --> 03:28:13.218]  They passed laws in Australia which gave the government permission to seize, remove children from the custody of their parents to ensure compliance with coronavirus rules.
[03:28:13.218 --> 03:28:23.904]  They used surveillance drums to catch people who weren't wearing masks outside and to keep track of cars that travel further than five kilometres from home.
[03:28:23.904 --> 03:28:29.828]  They gave themselves the power to enter people's homes without a warrant and perform spot checks.
[03:28:31.149 --> 03:28:34.679]  We showcased another video, there you see the pregnant woman being arrested.
[03:28:35.905 --> 03:28:44.447]  It's always interesting, by the way, I go back and I remember writing these articles, this one from September last year, so it's about 10 months old.
[03:28:44.447 --> 03:28:51.329]  I always go back to these articles and notice that the videos that were originally there have all been deleted on Twitter.
[03:28:51.329 --> 03:28:52.829]  Well, what a surprise!
[03:28:52.829 --> 03:28:57.391]  Either because they've made them delete the tweet or they've just suspended the account.
[03:28:57.391 --> 03:29:02.692]  So, I mean, you can see the screenshot, you can't watch the actual videos in many cases because they get deleted.
[03:29:03.686 --> 03:29:10.576]  The point is though, Australia is the most draconian, most authoritarian country in the developed world to enforce these lockdowns.
[03:29:10.576 --> 03:29:12.359]  And they're going for this disastrous...
[03:29:13.769 --> 03:29:18.070]  Crazy, insane policy of trying to achieve zero COVID.
[03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:28.393]  The same as New Zealand, because they've got it better in terms of being able to close their borders, but they think that by doing this they can just eliminate the virus altogether.
[03:29:28.393 --> 03:29:36.635]  So whenever you get a single case of it, a single case, they all freak out and they put everyone under lockdown again.
[03:29:36.635 --> 03:29:41.016]  Everyone in an entire city under lockdown because of one case.
[03:29:41.016 --> 03:29:42.877]  In fact, we highlighted it last month.
[03:29:44.065 --> 03:29:54.674]  Alice Springs, a town in Australia 800 miles away from the nearest city, went into full lockdown after just a single new case of Covid was detected.
[03:29:54.674 --> 03:29:55.995]  One case!
[03:29:55.995 --> 03:30:02.801]  The city's 800 miles away from any nearest other city and the entire city goes under lockdown.
[03:30:02.801 --> 03:30:11.309]  Well now it's gotten even worse for Australians and this is really a new level of inhumanity because the top health official in New South Wales
[03:30:12.359 --> 03:30:15.621]  And we've got the clip which we'll roll here in a second.
[03:30:15.621 --> 03:30:21.024]  Now says that Australians shouldn't be having conversations with each other.
[03:30:21.024 --> 03:30:26.687]  They're not just preventing them from eating in bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas, etc.
[03:30:26.687 --> 03:30:30.169]  They're now literally telling people they can't talk to each other.
[03:30:30.169 --> 03:30:32.651]  This is the government in Australia.
[03:30:32.651 --> 03:30:34.672]  Chief Health Officer of New South Wales
[03:30:35.376 --> 03:30:36.597]  They all look the same, by the way.
[03:30:36.597 --> 03:30:41.801]  This woman looks exactly the same as that communist hardliner, Susan Michie.
[03:30:41.801 --> 03:30:45.844]  They all look like middle-aged Karen women with their masks on.
[03:30:45.844 --> 03:30:54.190]  Well, she gave a press conference telling Australians they shouldn't engage in conversation with each other, even if they're wearing the sainted masks.
[03:30:54.190 --> 03:30:55.431]  And we have the clip.
[03:30:55.431 --> 03:30:58.153]  Here it is.
[03:30:58.153 --> 03:31:02.416]  Whilst it is in human nature to engage in conversation with others,
[03:31:03.243 --> 03:31:05.545]  To be friendly.
[03:31:05.545 --> 03:31:08.628]  Unfortunately, this is not the time to do that.
[03:31:08.628 --> 03:31:21.640]  So even if you run into your next door neighbour in the shopping centre, in the Coles, whilst you're at Coles Awards or Aldi or any other grocery shop, don't start up a conversation.
[03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:25.684]  Now is the time for minimising your interactions with others.
[03:31:25.684 --> 03:31:26.765]  Even if you've got a mask,
[03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:30.335]  Do not think that affords total protection.
[03:31:30.335 --> 03:31:38.310]  We want to be absolutely sure that as we go about our daily lives, we do not come into contact with anyone else that would pose a risk.
[03:31:40.862 --> 03:31:44.586]  So they've put everyone under a seven-day stay-at-home order.
[03:31:44.586 --> 03:31:47.569]  They've made masks compulsory again in schools.
[03:31:47.569 --> 03:31:50.452]  Teachers, students, kids have all got to wear them.
[03:31:50.452 --> 03:31:58.921]  And now they're literally giving press conferences telling Australians not to have conversations with each other in the grocery store.
[03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:02.843]  She talks about conversations being part of human nature.
[03:32:02.843 --> 03:32:07.947]  The government telling you you can't have a conversation with your friends or your neighbours, that's inhumane.
[03:32:07.947 --> 03:32:10.309]  That's completely inhumane.
[03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:18.076]  We thought we couldn't scale any more, plumb any more depths in this lockdown fiasco, but we've managed it today in Australia.
[03:32:18.076 --> 03:32:19.137]  And where's the backlash?
[03:32:19.989 --> 03:32:23.591]  I mean, when I think of Australians, I think of, you know, Crocodile Dundee.
[03:32:23.591 --> 03:32:26.113]  I thought they were supposed to be big, tough guys.
[03:32:26.113 --> 03:32:27.934]  Where are the protests?
[03:32:27.934 --> 03:32:29.395]  Where's the resistance?
[03:32:29.395 --> 03:32:31.156]  There's more resistance in London.
[03:32:31.156 --> 03:32:32.957]  There's more resistance in Greece.
[03:32:32.957 --> 03:32:35.238]  There's even more resistance in France.
[03:32:35.238 --> 03:32:36.859]  What are Australians doing?
[03:32:36.859 --> 03:32:38.660]  I thought they were tough.
[03:32:38.660 --> 03:32:40.081]  They're just accepting it.
[03:32:40.081 --> 03:32:45.884]  They're literally accepting being told by some bureaucrat they can't talk to their friend.
[03:32:45.884 --> 03:32:46.725]  That's insane.
[03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:59.434]  And somebody commented, in fact, it was the English pop group Right Said Fred, who are big lockdown sceptics and campaigners against lockdown.
[03:32:59.434 --> 03:33:00.555]  Very interesting comment.
[03:33:00.555 --> 03:33:04.157]  They said, quote, the desperation is front and centre.
[03:33:04.157 --> 03:33:09.580]  They're either running out of time or they're going insane right in front of our eyes.
[03:33:09.580 --> 03:33:12.001]  And I think that sums it up perfectly.
[03:33:13.157 --> 03:33:25.587]  Meanwhile, in the UK, on the day that Freedom Day was supposed to be happening, we of course had the announcement that we would have to present vaccine passports to go about basic social activities.
[03:33:25.587 --> 03:33:28.790]  We've seen this in Greece, we've seen it in France, as I mentioned before.
[03:33:29.617 --> 03:33:32.119]  In France, of course, they had to backtrack somewhat.
[03:33:32.119 --> 03:33:40.504]  Now they're saying they're graciously affording the citizenry in France the right to enter a supermarket without having been vaccinated.
[03:33:40.504 --> 03:33:44.706]  Yes, for the moment, they will let you eat.
[03:33:44.706 --> 03:33:47.308]  And we see a similar situation developing in the UK.
[03:33:47.308 --> 03:33:51.830]  The direction of travel is going from nightclubs, crowd of venues.
[03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:53.411]  Now they're saying maybe pubs.
[03:33:53.411 --> 03:33:56.233]  Now they're saying, almost for sure, football matches.
[03:33:57.233 --> 03:34:01.954]  Unvaccinated football fans to be banned from matches in the UK.
[03:34:01.954 --> 03:34:07.795]  Creating a two-tier society of the jabbed and the jabbed not.
[03:34:07.795 --> 03:34:15.716]  It's been reported that football clubs are likely to be told only supporters who can prove they've had the jab will be allowed to enter stadiums after the season starts later this summer.
[03:34:15.716 --> 03:34:25.118]  Daily Mail reports plans being drawn up that will require football fans to prove they've had two doses of Covid vaccination before they can attend matches from the end of September.
[03:34:26.514 --> 03:34:32.936]  Says if the measures, this is key, because they put a proviso in thinking that it's going to put people back to sleep.
[03:34:32.936 --> 03:34:42.920]  Says if the measure is introduced, government will be expected to fall back on the previous definition of large crowds, a definition which they can change at any moment because they've moved the goalposts on everything else.
[03:34:44.102 --> 03:34:49.564]  So in step three of the roadmap out of lockdown, which was a capacity of 16,000 spectators.
[03:34:49.564 --> 03:34:56.827]  However, the legal requirement on football fans to be vaccinated before they can attend games and negative COVID tests would not be enough.
[03:34:56.827 --> 03:34:59.528]  Oh, yeah, they've introduced that, by the way.
[03:34:59.528 --> 03:35:05.451]  See, in France, what they were doing is obtaining free COVID tests from the government
[03:35:06.292 --> 03:35:12.657]  And you shouldn't even have to put yourself through that, but they were using those free COVID tests to avoid having to get the vaccine.
[03:35:12.657 --> 03:35:14.158]  France banned that.
[03:35:14.158 --> 03:35:14.919]  They got rid of that.
[03:35:14.919 --> 03:35:17.181]  They say now you need your own COVID test.
[03:35:17.181 --> 03:35:24.066]  Now the UK has gone one step further and said you're not even allowed to prove you don't have COVID.
[03:35:24.066 --> 03:35:33.173]  You have to take the vaccine, despite the fact that there's a ton of people in hospital who took both jabs of the COVID vaccine and then got COVID because the vaccine works so well.
[03:35:34.164 --> 03:35:45.127]  But it says these rules will only come into force if coronavirus infection rates, deaths and hospitalisations are high, or there are dangerous variants circulating.
[03:35:45.127 --> 03:35:56.031]  And of course, what the government calls dangerous variants, or scarients as other people call them, will be circulating for years, making that qualification rather redundant.
[03:35:57.230 --> 03:36:12.135]  Now, this is all being introduced despite the fact that the government's own events research programme, where they had all these nightclub events, outdoor sporting events, to test whether coronavirus was very transmissible during these events,
[03:36:13.504 --> 03:36:18.228]  They found, quote, that it revealed few infections linked to outdoor sports events.
[03:36:18.228 --> 03:36:24.594]  So the government's own test pilot program found that this wasn't a super spreader event in any case.
[03:36:24.594 --> 03:36:27.116]  Wimbledon tennis championships was one.
[03:36:27.116 --> 03:36:31.000]  Some of the Euro 2020 games were other pilot test events.
[03:36:31.883 --> 03:36:37.893]  They found that they didn't spread the virus and yet they're still introducing the vaccine passports anyway.
[03:36:37.893 --> 03:36:39.115]  Why are they doing that?
[03:36:39.115 --> 03:36:42.260]  We'll get into that and more on the other side of the brain.
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:43.482]  Summit.News.
[03:36:43.482 --> 03:36:44.083]  Don't go away.
[03:36:44.083 --> 03:36:44.885]  We'll be right back.

[03:37:48.963 --> 03:37:52.647]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[03:37:52.647 --> 03:38:01.217]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death, and it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[03:38:02.148 --> 03:38:08.853]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship, while you still can, at 2020 prices.

[03:38:20.081 --> 03:38:22.023]  They've told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[03:38:22.543 --> 03:38:23.563]  But that's it.
[03:38:23.563 --> 03:38:28.184]  They won't do this sale again until November, and then the food prices go up in 2022.
[03:38:28.184 --> 03:38:30.164]  This is insurance you can eat.
[03:38:30.164 --> 03:38:31.445]  It's the highest quality.

[03:38:50.163 --> 03:38:58.349]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[03:38:58.349 --> 03:39:07.115]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[03:39:07.115 --> 03:39:14.059]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:39:14.059 --> 03:39:16.701]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[03:39:19.543 --> 03:39:20.083]  I think?
[03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:47.279]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[03:39:47.279 --> 03:39:49.802]  They're 50% off right now at m4warstore.com.
[03:39:53.525 --> 03:39:54.786]  Jacob in Ohio.
[03:39:54.786 --> 03:39:55.166]  Welcome.
[03:39:55.166 --> 03:39:55.606]  Go ahead.
[03:39:55.606 --> 03:39:56.927]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[03:39:56.927 --> 03:39:57.488]  Good, man.
[03:39:57.488 --> 03:39:58.588]  Great last caller.
[03:39:58.588 --> 03:40:01.630]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[03:40:01.630 --> 03:40:07.334]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[03:40:07.334 --> 03:40:08.915]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[03:40:09.495 --> 03:40:11.117]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire.
[03:40:11.117 --> 03:40:12.058]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[03:40:12.058 --> 03:40:12.438]  Go ahead.
[03:40:12.438 --> 03:40:13.979]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:40:13.979 --> 03:40:17.002]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[03:40:17.002 --> 03:40:18.684]  The X2 does wonders.
[03:40:18.684 --> 03:40:19.825]  I recommend it to everybody.
[03:40:19.825 --> 03:40:21.006]  You're on the fence about it.
[03:40:21.006 --> 03:40:21.786]  Get off the fence.
[03:40:21.786 --> 03:40:22.667]  Get the product.
[03:40:22.667 --> 03:40:23.868]  Support the Infowar.
[03:40:23.868 --> 03:40:25.170]  Tyler in Maine.
[03:40:25.170 --> 03:40:25.830]  You're on the air.
[03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:26.391]  Thanks for calling.
[03:40:26.391 --> 03:40:26.751]  Go ahead.
[03:40:26.751 --> 03:40:28.473]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[03:40:28.473 --> 03:40:29.233]  It's an honor.
[03:40:29.233 --> 03:40:29.494]  Honor.
[03:40:29.494 --> 03:40:29.874]  Talk to you.
[03:40:30.034 --> 03:40:31.154]  Awesome.
[03:40:31.154 --> 03:40:34.775]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product.
[03:40:34.775 --> 03:40:36.856]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[03:40:36.856 --> 03:40:39.337]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[03:40:39.337 --> 03:40:40.697]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[03:40:40.697 --> 03:40:42.617]  So, just number one for a few of the things I do.
[03:40:42.617 --> 03:40:43.338]  It definitely works.
[03:40:43.338 --> 03:40:44.978]  It's not a joke.
[03:40:44.978 --> 03:40:53.080]  Absolutely.
[03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:55.721]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:41:04.017 --> 03:41:13.725]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:41:13.725 --> 03:41:24.134]  So after months and months of claiming that they never had any plans to introduce a vaccine passport and having conducted their own study and admitted that it would be discriminatory to do so,
[03:41:24.935 --> 03:41:29.436]  The government yesterday announced that they would be introducing vaccine passports.
[03:41:29.436 --> 03:41:36.978]  The unvaccinated would be banned from football matches, nightclubs and other crowded events, maybe even pubs in the future.
[03:41:36.978 --> 03:41:46.920]  Might present a problem to them given that this country has at least 1 million illegal immigrants, the vast majority of whom are not going to get vaccines or vaccine passports.
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:51.742]  That's another spanner in the works that they may encounter at a later date.
[03:41:51.742 --> 03:41:53.122]  But we also have this headline.
[03:41:54.176 --> 03:41:57.906]  Report vaccine passports now may be demanded for office workers.
[03:41:57.906 --> 03:42:00.191]  Oh, but it's not mandatory.
[03:42:00.191 --> 03:42:02.116]  You just can't get a job without it.
[03:42:02.116 --> 03:42:03.119]  But it's not mandatory.
[03:42:04.133 --> 03:42:14.698]  The British Government has suggested that not only should so-called vaccine passports be used by clubs, pubs and restaurants, but also that office workers should be subject to the system in order to return to their jobs.
[03:42:14.698 --> 03:42:22.081]  London Telegraph Report's Department for Health and Social Care has indicated that the PASS system should be adopted in everyday workplaces.
[03:42:22.081 --> 03:42:23.602]  But again, it's not mandatory.
[03:42:23.602 --> 03:42:27.243]  You just can't feed your family without getting it!
[03:42:27.243 --> 03:42:28.244]  Good news here though!
[03:42:29.278 --> 03:42:35.440]  Nightclub owners say they'll refuse to enforce vaccine passports as a condition of entry.
[03:42:35.440 --> 03:42:40.983]  This was as yet another UK government minister refused to rule out vaccine passports for pubs.
[03:42:40.983 --> 03:42:49.666]  But nightclub owners say the plan to impose the same rules on their venues is shambolic, with some vowing to refuse to enforce it.
[03:42:49.666 --> 03:42:54.228]  Michael Kill, Chief Executive of the Nighttime Industries Association said, quote,
[03:42:54.992 --> 03:43:04.306]  The announcement from the Prime Minister that Covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs in September comes after his Health Secretary said only one week ago that they would not be compulsory.
[03:43:04.306 --> 03:43:05.889]  What an absolute shambles!
[03:43:07.208 --> 03:43:14.754]  Says, leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic U-turn that will leave nightclubs who have been planning for reopening for months will now have to make more changes to the way they operate.
[03:43:14.754 --> 03:43:15.854]  This is still a bad idea.
[03:43:15.854 --> 03:43:19.297]  Oh yeah, it's also completely unenforceable and impractical.
[03:43:19.297 --> 03:43:21.639]  Have you seen British nightclubs?
[03:43:21.639 --> 03:43:27.263]  Have you been to Newcastle or Manchester on a Saturday night and been trying to get into a nightclub?
[03:43:27.263 --> 03:43:32.246]  Yeah, it's a bit of a free-for-all, so good luck enforcing that.
[03:43:32.246 --> 03:43:36.830]  But Peter Marks, Chief Executive of nightclub operator Reccom UK, went further.
[03:43:37.538 --> 03:43:43.520]  Saying these nightclubs won't be requiring people to be double jabbed or they won't have anyone in.
[03:43:43.520 --> 03:43:46.221]  He said younger guests are 95% of our customers.
[03:43:46.221 --> 03:43:48.221]  They won't be fully vaccinated by September.
[03:43:48.221 --> 03:43:51.162]  We won't be requiring them, otherwise we won't have anyone in.
[03:43:51.162 --> 03:43:51.782]  That's the point.
[03:43:51.782 --> 03:43:55.584]  These nightclubs have profit margins of about 15%.
[03:43:55.584 --> 03:44:00.065]  If they don't, if they lose 15% of their customers, they're going out of business.
[03:44:00.065 --> 03:44:02.586]  35% of 18 to 13 year olds, 18 to 30 year olds in the UK haven't been vaccinated.
[03:44:07.006 --> 03:44:08.907]  So they're going to go out of business.
[03:44:08.907 --> 03:44:19.572]  Of course, the argument could be made that the government is merely making these threats to coerce young people into being vaccinated, which is what happened in Israel.
[03:44:19.572 --> 03:44:25.475]  And then when they introduced the vaccine passports to get into all these venues in Israel, it was never enforced.
[03:44:25.475 --> 03:44:26.715]  It was a complete joke.
[03:44:26.715 --> 03:44:30.457]  Oh, but then they had another variant and maybe they do have to start enforcing it.
[03:44:31.181 --> 03:44:39.843]  But it's good to see that nightclub operators are saying they're just going to disobey completely and refuse, although, you know, we've heard that before and they didn't.
[03:44:39.843 --> 03:44:44.984]  Andrew Lloyd Webber said he'd be arrested if he opened his theatre.
[03:44:44.984 --> 03:44:49.885]  He never followed through on that promise, so that remains to be seen, I believe, when I see it.
[03:44:49.885 --> 03:44:54.046]  Meanwhile, local family restaurant becomes latest victim of lockdown as rich get richer.
[03:44:54.750 --> 03:45:01.992]  This was a restaurant I used to go to about 15 years ago, when I used to live up in Sheffield, called Julio's.
[03:45:01.992 --> 03:45:11.294]  The only restaurant in the entire village, and now it's closed down as a result of COVID-19, as they announced on their Facebook page.
[03:45:11.294 --> 03:45:21.417]  Given that Julio's was the only restaurant in the area, aside from pubs which are also struggling, its loss is sure to be keenly felt by the local community, given that it had been a much-loved gathering place for almost 20 years.
[03:45:21.417 --> 03:45:23.278]  And this is just one story.
[03:45:23.278 --> 03:45:23.918]  This has happened.
[03:45:25.693 --> 03:45:34.636]  10% of restaurants in the UK have closed down permanently, and in fact it's more than that, because they're including the numbers of the ones that have opened.
[03:45:34.636 --> 03:45:39.958]  So it's probably more like 15% at least of restaurants in the UK have closed.
[03:45:39.958 --> 03:45:45.060]  Not as a result of the pandemic, because Sweden kept its restaurants open, didn't it?
[03:45:45.060 --> 03:45:48.321]  And didn't have as high a death toll as the UK.
[03:45:48.321 --> 03:45:50.562]  It's because of the lockdown.
[03:45:51.454 --> 03:45:55.819]  Casual dining venues fell by 19.4%.
[03:45:55.819 --> 03:46:02.406]  Another report found that almost 10,000 licensed premises in the UK, including pubs, clubs and restaurants, had closed during 2020.
[03:46:04.053 --> 03:46:10.118]  Meanwhile, the combined wealth of the world's 10 richest men rose by $540 billion.
[03:46:10.118 --> 03:46:12.780]  Jeff Bezos of Amazon is doing just fine.
[03:46:12.780 --> 03:46:25.149]  He sent himself into space today with some of the $86 billion that he made as a result of Amazon shares soaring because, of course, most of their smaller competition went out of business.
[03:46:25.149 --> 03:46:26.370]  Everyone was stuck at home.
[03:46:26.370 --> 03:46:27.751]  They couldn't go into shops.
[03:46:27.751 --> 03:46:29.652]  They had to order from Amazon.
[03:46:29.652 --> 03:46:30.653]  The rich got richer.
[03:46:31.647 --> 03:46:41.034]  Billionaires exploited the impact of lockdown to create a rigged economy, according to Oxfam, causing expanding wealth inequalities during the worst economic downturn in a century.
[03:46:41.034 --> 03:46:45.717]  There were a record number of billionaires created in the UK, even as small businesses went under.
[03:46:45.717 --> 03:46:50.180]  A lockdown saw 150 million people globally pushed into extreme poverty.
[03:46:50.180 --> 03:46:53.022]  You'd think the left would care about that, wouldn't you?
[03:46:53.022 --> 03:46:53.903]  They don't give a damn.
[03:46:53.903 --> 03:46:55.784]  They want more lockdown.
[03:46:55.784 --> 03:47:00.928]  Let's shift gears now and go into this quick Nigel Farage video, because today we had
[03:47:02.742 --> 03:47:06.367]  430 illegal immigrants land on the southern English coast.
[03:47:06.367 --> 03:47:09.871]  This is out of Brightbar, another record day in the English Channel.
[03:47:09.871 --> 03:47:12.595]  There's 430 illegals brought ashore on Monday.
[03:47:13.624 --> 03:47:24.517]  Says the boat migrant crisis in the English Channel set yet another daily record with the British Border Force taking over 430 illegal aliens ashore after they set sail from France.
[03:47:24.517 --> 03:47:30.083]  Of course, they get taxi service, they get free food, they get put up in four-star hotels, but we can't travel.
[03:47:30.083 --> 03:47:32.987]  Here is Nigel Farage talking about this issue.
[03:47:32.987 --> 03:47:33.828]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:47:35.366 --> 03:47:39.852]  Very, very few of these people would ever qualify as refugees.
[03:47:39.852 --> 03:47:46.320]  And if it's so awful where they've come from, why on earth have they deserted the women and children there?
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:50.104]  As you can tell, I take a very, very firm line on this.
[03:47:50.104 --> 03:47:53.228]  I think we're being humiliated on the world stage.
[03:47:53.228 --> 03:47:54.390]  I really, honestly do.
[03:47:55.431 --> 03:47:58.473]  Priti Patel has made a series of strong statements.
[03:47:58.473 --> 03:48:01.756]  They began back in the August of 2019.
[03:48:01.756 --> 03:48:05.340]  She keeps telling us what she's going to do and nothing has changed.
[03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:06.781]  The problem is getting worse.
[03:48:06.781 --> 03:48:10.505]  Four-star hotels have been filled up all over the country.
[03:48:10.505 --> 03:48:17.491]  There are over 60,000 people who have either failed their asylum claims or are waiting to be processed.
[03:48:17.491 --> 03:48:18.092]  But even if
[03:48:18.932 --> 03:48:24.217]  And when, in most cases, they fail, they will still remain in this country.
[03:48:24.217 --> 03:48:26.459]  It is coming at a massive cost to us.
[03:48:26.459 --> 03:48:29.222]  Massive financial cost to us.
[03:48:29.222 --> 03:48:31.484]  I would suggest quite a big security risk.
[03:48:32.142 --> 03:48:34.944]  As we just don't know who most of these young men are.
[03:48:34.944 --> 03:48:37.286]  Very few of them have ID papers.
[03:48:37.286 --> 03:48:38.187]  It's a trick.
[03:48:38.187 --> 03:48:42.490]  Get rid of your passport and then you can't actually be returned anywhere.
[03:48:42.490 --> 03:48:53.719]  And I'm going to follow this because, as I say, I think within the space of the next few weeks, this will become the biggest non-Covid story in this country.
[03:48:53.719 --> 03:48:57.262]  I think the numbers that are coming are about to explode.
[03:49:00.012 --> 03:49:04.655]  So during this supposedly deadly pandemic, we've got hundreds of migrants arriving every day.
[03:49:04.655 --> 03:49:13.501]  We've got them being given escorts, taxi services by the British government, given free food, free money, put up in free hotels at taxpayer expense.
[03:49:13.501 --> 03:49:24.808]  Meanwhile, if I want to come back from France, or if I want to come back from Spain after visiting my parents, which I basically can't do, haven't seen them since last year, I have to self-quarantine for two weeks.
[03:49:24.808 --> 03:49:26.389]  Maybe I should just get on a dinghy.
[03:49:27.151 --> 03:49:32.532]  If I want to go to France and come back that way, then I'll be treated like absolute royalty.
[03:49:32.532 --> 03:49:34.093]  Then of course you have the security issue.
[03:49:34.093 --> 03:49:40.814]  We saw the video of these migrants arriving, just screaming, running off into the town in different directions.
[03:49:40.814 --> 03:49:43.275]  Half of them weren't even processed.
[03:49:43.275 --> 03:49:44.955]  God knows who they are.
[03:49:44.955 --> 03:49:50.037]  Gaddafi warned that ISIS would exploit this refugee wave to commit atrocities.
[03:49:50.037 --> 03:49:51.677]  That's precisely what happened.
[03:49:52.549 --> 03:49:58.794]  Happened in the case of the Paris Massacre, where the majority of the terrorists exploited this wave.
[03:49:58.794 --> 03:50:00.095]  They claimed to be refugees.
[03:50:00.095 --> 03:50:01.456]  They were let into the country.
[03:50:01.456 --> 03:50:05.479]  Our own government rescued the Manchester Arena bomber as a refugee.
[03:50:05.479 --> 03:50:16.148]  You've had a spate of beheadings in France from where these migrants are coming from over the past two years of terrorists who again entered the country on a refugee wave.
[03:50:16.148 --> 03:50:18.449]  And now some of them are all coming here.
[03:50:18.449 --> 03:50:21.372]  But I can't go to Spain to see my own parents.
[03:50:22.529 --> 03:50:35.297]  Meanwhile, back in jolly old England, Sadiq Khan says new statue of activist who beheaded white colonisers in front of their children reflects London's achievements in diversity.
[03:50:35.297 --> 03:50:46.845]  This is a statue of John Chilwembe, an anti-colonial activist awarded the decapitation of William Livingstone, very nice fella, in front of his children and then displayed his head on a pike.
[03:50:47.581 --> 03:50:55.845]  Saying, this is according to Sadiq Khan, that putting up a statue of this individual reflects London's achievements and diversity.
[03:50:55.845 --> 03:51:14.035]  So basically, celebrating white European farmers who went over to Malawi in the early 1900s, the people who decapitated them in front of their children and then put their heads on spikes during a church service afterwards, those are the people who we need to now celebrate.
[03:51:15.737 --> 03:51:17.137]  That's going to wrap it up though again.
[03:51:17.137 --> 03:51:19.798]  Massive protests in London yesterday.
[03:51:19.798 --> 03:51:21.818]  There's another protest on Saturday.
[03:51:21.818 --> 03:51:25.999]  It looks like it's going to be the biggest ever anti-lockdown protest.
[03:51:25.999 --> 03:51:31.080]  I'll be there and I encourage everyone else in London, in the UK, to be there as well.
[03:51:31.080 --> 03:51:33.961]  That's going to wrap it up though for the Summit.News Hour.
[03:51:33.961 --> 03:51:36.602]  Coming up next, War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:51:36.602 --> 03:51:37.342]  Keep it locked in.
