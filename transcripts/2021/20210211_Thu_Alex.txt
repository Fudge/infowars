[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.834]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:06.558]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.464]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreier.
[00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:14.710]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:18.508]  Ambiguity.
[00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:30.272]  All the self-anointed experts of the Constitution keep saying that the Constitution is ambiguous enough to impeach a former president for a vague interpretation of the intention of his words.
[00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:41.995]  Some of my Republican colleagues have latched on to a fringe legal theory that the Senate does not have the constitutional power to hold a trial because Donald Trump is no longer in office.
[00:00:43.032 --> 00:00:48.176]  This argument has been roundly debunked by constitutional scholars from the left, right, and center.
[00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:55.021]  If the president is impeached, the unambiguous text of the Constitution commands that the Chief Justice of the United States shall preside.
[00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.524]  In this case, the Chief Justice clearly is not presiding.
[00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:01.566]  The constitutional text itself is ambiguous.
[00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.367]  It could be read one way or the other.
[00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:11.353]  Well, then wouldn't that mean that everything written in the Constitution is ambiguous and open to politically motivated interpretation?
[00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:12.334]  In particular,
[00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:30.751]  Article 1 section 6 regarding the legislature reads, the senators and representatives shall in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses.
[00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:35.516]  That's right, privileged from arrest except for treason,
[00:01:35.956 --> 00:02:02.413]  Eric Swalwell, who has used his office to promote Beijing's talking points, almost word for word, ones that matter, by the way, a man who admits to a close personal relationship with an actual Chinese spy, who helped him get elected to Congress, raised money for him, and put an intern, probably another spy, in his office, that man continues to serve on the House Intelligence Committee, where he has unrestricted access to classified information.
[00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:03.534]  Felony.
[00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:12.606]  Tara Reid was a 29-year-old staff assistant in Joe Biden's Senate office in 1993 when she says aides told her to bring him his gym bag.
[00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:17.934]  I was up against the wall and I remember his hands underneath my blouse and underneath my skirt.
[00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:23.249]  And his fingers penetrating me as he was trying to kiss me and I was pulling away.
[00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.150]  And breach of the peace.
[00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.272]  This is a movement, I'm telling you.
[00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:28.792]  They're not going to stop.
[00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:32.955]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:37.417]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:47.820]  You're seeing leaders on the right calling it out.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.380]  You're not seeing any leaders on the left calling it out.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.542]  In fact, you're seeing some of the leaders on the left inciting more violence, calling on more violence instead of saying there's no place for it.
[00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:59.303]  Let's start with the text of the Constitution.
[00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:33.961]  Which in Article 1, Section 2, gives the House the sole power of impeachment when the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:36.883]  We exercised that power on January 13th.
[00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:42.947]  The President, it is undisputed, committed his offense while he was President.
[00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:48.631]  And it is undisputed that we impeached him while he was President.
[00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:52.774]  There can be no doubt that this is a valid and legitimate impeachment.
[00:03:53.373 --> 00:04:00.741]  But the argument that you lack jurisdiction rests on a purely fictional loophole.
[00:04:01.562 --> 00:04:02.283]  Purely fictional.
[00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:11.208]  Designed to allow the former president to escape all accountability for conduct that is truly indefensible.
[00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.852]  So is this claim that there's a slippery slope to impeaching private citizens if you proceed.
[00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:30.398]  The trial of a former official for abuses he committed as an official, arising from an impeachment that occurred while he was an official, poses absolutely no risk whatsoever
[00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:35.187]  Of subjecting a private citizen to impeachment for their private conduct.
[00:04:35.953 --> 00:04:44.698]  Their Trump derangement syndrome inspired arguments don't hold up to the textual common sense interpretation of the Constitution.
[00:04:45.478 --> 00:04:54.363]  An impeachment trial of a private citizen, Trump, held before the Senate would be nothing more nor less than the trial of a private citizen by a legislative body.
[00:04:54.763 --> 00:05:05.269]  An impeachment trial by the Senate of a private citizen violates Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, which provides that no bill of attainder shall be passed.
[00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:23.895]  The Bill of Attainder, as this clause is known, prohibits Congress from enacting a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.
[00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:30.849]  A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial.
[00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.330]  A judicial trial.
[00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:35.651]  Let's turn to a reading of the text now.
[00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:49.379]  The president, vice president, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.862]  From which office shall a non-president be removed if convicted?
[00:05:56.536 --> 00:06:06.400]  A non-president doesn't hold an office, therefore cannot be impeached under this clause, which provides for the removal from office of the person under the impeachment attack.
[00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:11.783]  What the Democrats have presented is the ultimate weapon of cancel culture.
[00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:18.566]  As their minions erase history, toppling statues of presidents like Teddy Roosevelt, for example,
[00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:31.813]  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday said the city was in favor of the request from the museum to remove the statue because it, quote, depicts black and indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior.
[00:06:32.293 --> 00:06:40.678]  The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments.
[00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:50.599]  And persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control.
[00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.700]  We're not conforming.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.761]  That's why we're here, actually.
[00:06:53.482 --> 00:07:02.009]  Is there any doubt that they would have the trust buster erased from American presidential history and every other president they deem deplorable?
[00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.651]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:09.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is February 11th.
[00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:09.676]  The year is 2021.
[00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:13.441]  On this Thursday broadcast, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:07:14.102 --> 00:07:17.206]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours ahead of Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[00:07:19.764 --> 00:07:29.812]  Every day gets more intense as we accelerate towards the quickening, Judgment Day, the New Age, whatever you out there believe it to be that's now dawning, accelerating upon us.
[00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:32.754]  But let me just show you the stacks today.
[00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:38.439]  This is the stack of Disney officially running giant pedophile rings and raping small children.
[00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.780]  Just mainstream news today.
[00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:42.274]  We're getting to that.
[00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:45.156]  Crypto has had its massive victory.
[00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.459]  The establishment is now accepting it everywhere.
[00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:54.105]  The oldest bank in the U.S., the oldest bank in Europe, MasterCard, Visa, they're all saying they're going to be accepting it.
[00:07:54.826 --> 00:08:02.493]  And so my feeling is it was hatched by the globalists the entire time and that they would end up bringing it forward because it has blockchain in it.
[00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:03.594]  I think?
[00:08:24.764 --> 00:08:25.504]  Of our lifetimes.
[00:08:26.284 --> 00:08:34.607]  It is official what Bill Gates called for on Bill Moyers and what he called for at TED Talks and what he called for on CNN.
[00:08:34.627 --> 00:08:36.287]  We have three clips of it in the last few years.
[00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:49.291]  Calling for the euthanasia of old people because we quote can't pay for the aging population in Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand.
[00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:57.899]  And he says, you kill an old person and you can hire 10 teachers.
[00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:05.146]  And that's not how it really works, but they put that preface out there that that's the moral thing to do.
[00:09:05.347 --> 00:09:08.130]  And so the reports are pouring in.
[00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:14.843]  Every day, 5 died here, 4 died here, 3 died here, 10 died here, 7 died here.
[00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:23.026]  And it's only in the nursing homes where the employees notice all of the death and say something.
[00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:32.489]  Most of these places know to keep it quiet and say they died of something else, but in many of the cases, I'm going to read to you from the CDC's own website.
[00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:34.509]  Oh, they even have a record of this.
[00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.210]  Some of them die within 15 minutes.
[00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.106]  So the headline's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:51.787]  Seniors who already beat COVID-19 are dying after taking the vaccine.
[00:09:52.307 --> 00:09:59.849]  But the real headline is CDC admits massive numbers of old people dying after taking the shot.
[00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.911]  And you'll notice, it'll be like, nursing home in Sweden suspends shot after 14 die.
[00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:10.212]  And you look up the nursing home and they got 120 people in it.
[00:10:10.232 --> 00:10:11.273]  Do you have any idea?
[00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:12.393]  That's like releasing
[00:10:14.504 --> 00:10:16.906]  A hundred King Cobras in there or something.
[00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:22.650]  King Cobra bites you down about five minutes.
[00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:30.096]  A rattlesnake bites you usually down about two or three days after the leg or arm swells up and atrophies and then bursts open.
[00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:31.697]  So let me explain something.
[00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:39.543]  These vaccines are killing people in many cases as fast as a King Cobra.
[00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:43.626]  15 feet long, giant head, fangs an inch long.
[00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:48.398]  Pumps ounces of pure neurotoxin into your body.
[00:10:51.799 --> 00:11:00.062]  Imagine if there was a wasp that was stinging people, and it stung 100 people in a nursing home, 120, and 14 die.
[00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:04.644]  But they just hide it in plain view, oh well, and it's all been beta tested.
[00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:09.726]  As I told you, Dew interviewed him, David Knight interviewed him, I interviewed him, we got these nurses back on.
[00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:10.786]  Four years ago,
[00:11:12.285 --> 00:11:21.912]  It came out in mainstream news, but they were just conditioning everyone, getting everybody ready for it, that
[00:11:24.461 --> 00:11:35.165]  Oh, the bioethics board at the hospitals are ordering these big birthing hospitals to give preemie babies their vaccines, even though they would never do it before because they know it kills them.
[00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:41.028]  But the nurses have to get permission that when they die, they give them a shot, and up to a third of them die, they resuscitate.
[00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:44.089]  Their heart stops, and some hospitals said, no, that's not allowed.
[00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:45.810]  Liberal.
[00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.211]  So what's going on here is euthanasia.
[00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:55.182]  And you know euthanasia and sterilization was going on until the 80s.
[00:11:55.743 --> 00:11:58.884]  The last state to stop it was Oregon because it's liberal.
[00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:03.166]  And they were sterilizing poor people and quietly killing old folks as well.
[00:12:07.267 --> 00:12:09.208]  So that's who they are.
[00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:13.950]  And they're also saying, oh, we're not going to resuscitate somebody that is positive for COVID.
[00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.351]  Well, that's 96% of people get tested.
[00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:15.931]  It's all fake.
[00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:20.583]  Remember, oh, we're not going to resuscitate people that have a heart attack on the side of the highway.
[00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:20.963]  Remember that?
[00:12:21.404 --> 00:12:21.764]  10 months ago?
[00:12:21.964 --> 00:12:28.873]  Because the hospitals are so overwhelmed and so full, that's just to get nurses used to it, paramedics, like, don't resuscitate.
[00:12:29.093 --> 00:12:34.399]  Oh, you got a little message on your phone from the County Bioethics Board that came down from the CDC.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.061]  Don't resuscitate anybody now.
[00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:37.183]  Do harm.
[00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.703]  So I'm going to get to this stack in great detail.
[00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:41.784]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:12:41.804 --> 00:12:44.486]  That's just one area of the COVID news.
[00:12:44.887 --> 00:12:49.611]  Biden is preparing to announce domestic checkpoints and travel restrictions in the United States.
[00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:52.153]  Total, complete, massive martial law.
[00:12:55.435 --> 00:12:59.679]  Biden administration considering whether to impose domestic travel restrictions, including on Florida.
[00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.560]  That's the Miami Herald reports.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.201]  It says, oh, yes, we want that.
[00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.402]  That sounds really fun.
[00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.184]  Trying out all the tyrannies.
[00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:07.285]  It's so much fun.
[00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:17.119]  And it goes on, oh, Swedish nursing home residents suicidal after getting vaccinated after being locked up for 11 months and learning you still can't ever see your families.
[00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:19.740]  But we're going to ship COVID patients in to kill you.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.581]  Sorry, that's just so loving.
[00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:24.781]  But meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:28.743]  banned from Instagram days after outlining Bill Gates' global domination.
[00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:31.203]  Now he's bought off all the major health systems in the world.
[00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:33.384]  Well, you don't talk about that.
[00:13:34.024 --> 00:13:38.266]  Jeff Zuckerberg is the aide de camp to old Gatesies.
[00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:40.070]  We're Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.472]  He's calling him Jeff Zuckerberg from Jeff Zucker of CNN.
[00:13:42.792 --> 00:13:43.653]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:56.185]  And so, oops, sorry, you can't put out a detailed report showing all the things Gates controls or the 30-something country he's been banned in, where they got caught giving kids HIV and hepatitis and what was the other one?
[00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:56.746]  Polio.
[00:13:57.206 --> 00:13:59.448]  Hell, that's even in Reuters.
[00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.091]  But the main cause is Bill Gates for polio now.
[00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:08.684]  Don't talk about it, because we're a liberal-loving democracy.
[00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:11.127]  So I've got all that in just this stack over here.
[00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:11.928]  It gets much worse.
[00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:13.991]  CDC officially says wear two masks.
[00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:15.412]  They say maybe three soon.
[00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:16.914]  So it's all good.
[00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:20.498]  And then it gets really fun.
[00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:22.240]  Officially, we now know.
[00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:39.469]  That the lawyers that Trump hired, because the first groups were bad, the second group was bad, the third group was bad, have all either sued him or Democrats that hate him and say that Trump's a criminal, and they're actually sabotaging him, publicly saying he deserves to be kicked out of office and that voters were smart and voted him out.
[00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:46.675]  So instead of putting on evidence of election fraud, the lawyers are all slipping in, by the way, the Americans are smart, they kicked Trump out.
[00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:50.967]  Because the fix is in.
[00:14:50.987 --> 00:14:52.168]  That's the thing about authoritarianism.
[00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:54.230]  Everybody's running the white flag up.
[00:14:54.691 --> 00:14:56.192]  I know a lot of prominent people.
[00:14:56.673 --> 00:15:01.057]  They either say they're just getting out of politics for life, or they're going to join with Soran.
[00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.080]  You know, that's what Soran, Soroban does.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.623]  He says, no one can stand against the power of Mordor, Gandalf.
[00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:09.265]  We must join with it.
[00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:14.187]  These are allegories of what's happened in the past.
[00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:15.468]  It's happening again.
[00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:18.392]  And believe me, it's gonna get real bad.
[00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.955]  And I know a lot of people say, oh, I can't listen to this, this is scary.
[00:15:21.195 --> 00:15:24.780]  Well, the only defense we have is admitting it and getting ready.
[00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:37.577]  So we have the Democrats caught repeatedly doctoring videos and lying about quotes and saying that Trump supporters burned down that church that Trump went out with the Bible and said it was wrong to burn.
[00:15:37.637 --> 00:15:39.277]  It was Black Lives Matter and Antifa burned it.
[00:15:39.978 --> 00:15:42.599]  They officially said he burned it.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.260]  Trump burned it.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.121]  His supporters burned it.
[00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.804]  And they said stabbed police through the heart with spears.
[00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:52.298]  Wow!
[00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:53.400]  None of that ever happened.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.507]  It doesn't matter because the same lawyer cried and said, my daughter's scared.
[00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:04.637]  Oh, but even Lindsey Graham, the little establishment creature, came out and said, hmm, what did Pelosi know?
[00:16:04.677 --> 00:16:05.238]  When does she know it?
[00:16:05.478 --> 00:16:09.462]  Because the Democrats have now been caught running provocateur groups, just as I told you.
[00:16:09.482 --> 00:16:12.625]  And if I'd have just been there 30 minutes earlier, I could have stopped them.
[00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:14.607]  Because they're like, attack!
[00:16:14.687 --> 00:16:15.648]  Alex Jones says so!
[00:16:15.668 --> 00:16:16.669]  And we know they were antifa people.
[00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:19.072]  And then they had fights with the cops, and a few broke through.
[00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:21.654]  And then a smattering of cutards joined in.
[00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:23.456]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:23.476 --> 00:16:23.996]  Please stay with us.
[00:16:24.396 --> 00:16:30.078]  Look, we are well past the point of being able to righteously use violence against these institutions and organizations.
[00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:44.085]  But having a few Democrats and a few infiltrator groups trigger, out of hundreds of thousands of peaceful people in D.C., a few hundred to go in the Capitol so you can be called insurrectionists and terrorists is not the place or the time for it.
[00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.966]  But I will tell you that
[00:16:48.757 --> 00:17:05.519]  I was in a halfway decent mood today but I was already aware of the euthanasia of the old and how would I come on air and give it the gravitas it needs so we don't all just get conditioned to accepting this and I was reading the statistics and the numbers and just going through the stacks and I physically
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:17.725]  Became nauseous because my nervous system was telling me you need to go visit violence upon the people that are doing this.
[00:17:18.425 --> 00:17:24.748]  If you let them kill old people like this and kill babies already born and they admit they're doing it you are an accomplice.
[00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:26.949]  My very cells are telling me
[00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:29.083]  Defend these people.
[00:17:29.624 --> 00:17:41.808]  So for all of you out there that are mad at me because I'm saying let's not be violent, let's not be offensive, I understand your guts and your blood and your soul and your mind is burning with the desire to kill.
[00:17:42.368 --> 00:17:43.048]  I understand that.
[00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:48.170]  I want to stop these people just as much as you do.
[00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:56.193]  But we've got to be wise as serpents and peaceful as doves and walk gently but carry a big stick.
[00:17:58.462 --> 00:17:59.585]  Evil is here.
[00:17:59.805 --> 00:18:02.951]  It is manifesting, it is uncloaking, it is doing unspeakable things.
[00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:07.621]  The top scientists came out and said this vaccine is going to massively kill old people.
[00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.113]  Two and a half months ago, they started the shots with the Pfizer shot first, mRNA.
[00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:19.897]  It killed so many old people in the first week, and the military said, we can't cover this up.
[00:18:20.297 --> 00:18:22.839]  We're having revolts in the ranks, because it's the military doing it.
[00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:25.000]  I mean, they give them a shot, they die like five minutes later.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.303]  I mean, a lot of them, most of them about an hour later, that do die.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:39.384]  I mean, people know these nursing homes where there's 20 people, 100 people, 200, and then you got 200 people and 10 of them die, or 120 and 13, 14 die within a day.
[00:18:39.404 --> 00:18:42.906]  I mean, people are like, holy hell, we're killing old people.
[00:18:43.586 --> 00:18:46.428]  Some of them happy old folks that are playing checkers, how you doing?
[00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:47.428]  They're dead in an hour.
[00:18:47.908 --> 00:18:48.769]  I'll take my shot.
[00:18:49.209 --> 00:18:52.690]  I mean, my God, how many prominent old people have you heard died lately?
[00:18:53.771 --> 00:18:55.292]  And they go, oh, they didn't die of COVID.
[00:18:55.452 --> 00:18:58.153]  Oh, they did die after they got the second round of the shot.
[00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:08.532]  So I just want everybody to know the left and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg and
[00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:17.674]  Jack Dorsey, you know what you're doing, and you are just as guilty as Bill Gates, especially Mark Zuckerberg, who works directly under him.
[00:19:17.994 --> 00:19:23.076]  He's the next guy in line to be science officer of North America for the New World Order.
[00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:31.159]  And you guys are mass-murdering killers, and I know who you are, and everybody knows who you are, and you will pay for what you've done, murderers.
[00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:33.900]  I don't care what you do to me.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.641]  You are guilty.
[00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:39.162]  Everybody else is scared to call your asses out.
[00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:41.675]  So I'll just tell everybody.
[00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.818]  I was on air the other day and I said, if a civil war starts, don't go after the cops and military.
[00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:52.521]  That's a diversionary tactic to wipe them out for the Chinese and have a civil war.
[00:19:52.841 --> 00:19:53.682]  Don't have the civil war.
[00:19:53.702 --> 00:19:59.645]  That's why they've had the lockdowns, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, try to provocateur us to get a civil war where we all kill each other.
[00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:01.026]  We don't want a civil war.
[00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:04.128]  We want a removal of the globalists and their collaborators.
[00:20:06.274 --> 00:20:07.534]  And they're spoiling for a fight!
[00:20:07.594 --> 00:20:18.836]  I mean, they've got the former director of the CIA, current people, high-level, saying, we want to fight insurrectionists, we want to shut down their networks, we want to silence the people that are questioning us, and we want to kill them!
[00:20:19.096 --> 00:20:20.317]  And it's all, it's a threat to everybody!
[00:20:20.497 --> 00:20:21.637]  Oh, I'm so scared!
[00:20:22.277 --> 00:20:26.818]  You ought to be scared of God judging you, Brennan, in your little snake-like communist mouth!
[00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:31.279]  So let's just look at all this right here, okay?
[00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:32.319]  I'll show you this.
[00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:39.258]  Watch the doctored video presented as evidence in Trump impeachment trial.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.861]  And it's all badly doctored!
[00:20:46.482 --> 00:20:47.462]  Detrumpification!
[00:20:47.543 --> 00:20:53.946]  Media lays out plan to deprogram Trump supporters for their extremist views, including killing their leadership.
[00:20:53.966 --> 00:20:55.727]  I'm going to read you all this.
[00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.932]  And of course now, some good news, Senator Graham understands what's happening.
[00:21:03.332 --> 00:21:07.813]  Even though he's an establishment guy, he realizes the balance of the old system is out of whack and he's gonna be targeted next.
[00:21:08.313 --> 00:21:13.715]  See, that's why we have separation of powers, so the corrupt don't always give each other all the power because they can wipe each other out.
[00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:14.896]  Founders were smart.
[00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.938]  And he points to the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election.
[00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:30.356]  Where they bragged that they knew there were provocateurs coming to town to attack the Capitol and blame Trump, and that they stood down and got out of their way to make sure it happened.
[00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:32.717]  That video's coming up next segment.
[00:21:33.197 --> 00:21:38.480]  Video, Graham asked, what did Pelosi know about the Capitol riot?
[00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:49.746]  And he goes on to say, she was briefed a week before and the day before, and they knew specifically what was going on, and then had the police, over half of them, go do traffic control in other parts of the city.
[00:21:51.257 --> 00:21:52.657]  Because the city of D.C.
[00:21:52.717 --> 00:21:53.918]  runs the Capitol Police as well.
[00:21:54.738 --> 00:21:57.398]  And so, I mean, I got there, there was like almost no cops.
[00:21:57.418 --> 00:22:06.520]  There was like 30 cops trying to hold back, you know, a couple hundred operatives and then idiots that thought they were secretly in a Q operation, and this was it.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.461]  And they even had former FBI agents believing this crap.
[00:22:11.501 --> 00:22:14.182]  Because they were in contact with the President over 8chan.
[00:22:15.062 --> 00:22:19.003]  The same 4chan, 8chan people that set us up with Pizzagate.
[00:22:20.371 --> 00:22:23.274]  To cover up all the real stuff and send us down a damn rabbit trail!
[00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:25.437]  Unbelievable.
[00:22:26.138 --> 00:22:29.781]  And so, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and now it's starting to come out.
[00:22:30.903 --> 00:22:32.504]  We're gonna break all that down when we come back.
[00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:35.868]  But just look at these other headlines.
[00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:40.994]  Remember Kamala Harris joked about killing President Trump and then let out a horrible cackle?
[00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.091]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:50.196]  Hillary Clinton says GOP senators who don't convict Trump are co-conspirators and need to be dealt with.
[00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:52.498]  Boy, talk about a power trip.
[00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:54.679]  They've killed a lot of folks though and gotten away with it.
[00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:57.361]  Here's another question.
[00:22:57.441 --> 00:23:00.644]  Are Trump's lawyers tanking the impeachment trial on purpose?
[00:23:00.804 --> 00:23:01.385]  I don't know.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.261]  Yes folks, everybody knows these lawyers.
[00:23:04.281 --> 00:23:05.622]  These are very competent lawyers.
[00:23:06.082 --> 00:23:08.624]  They are sabotaging Trump because they've been told to.
[00:23:09.225 --> 00:23:10.886]  They wouldn't have had a trial unless it was rigged.
[00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:16.710]  That's why his lawyers are like, Trump actually lost the election and you've done a great job and you've proved he's bad.
[00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.531]  He's actually, you've proved he's guilty!
[00:23:21.018 --> 00:23:22.499]  Because it's a bunch of cowards!
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.941]  The globalists are making their move!
[00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:49.239]  All these so-called men are a bunch of pinstripe-wearing, knuckle-dragging, dirty, stupid crooks that have screwed this country over and sold it out to China, and you've got a consortium of dirtbag lawyers and a consortium of pedophile leftists and just a bunch of nasty hunchback globalists that just absolutely are going to mount this country's head on a wall, and I'll tell you why.
[00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:51.405]  I'll tell you why.
[00:23:51.766 --> 00:23:53.747]  Because they hate themselves and they're going down.
[00:23:53.968 --> 00:23:55.009]  Hollywood's going down.
[00:23:55.449 --> 00:23:56.970]  All the leftist cities are going down.
[00:23:57.331 --> 00:23:59.913]  And that's because they're run by the same slave master, Satan.
[00:24:00.133 --> 00:24:01.975]  And now they want to just drag us down with them.
[00:24:03.076 --> 00:24:08.700]  Anderson Cooper, all of Anderson Cooper, compares Trump supporters and perpetrators to Rwandan genocide.
[00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.203]  The Clintons ran that with the UN.
[00:24:11.223 --> 00:24:12.003]  I love it!
[00:24:13.024 --> 00:24:15.266]  The liberal elite runs the genocide.
[00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:17.148]  And then you compare
[00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:28.700]  A one cop having a heart attack and a stroke two days later, to Pearl Harbor, and the genocide of a million Rwandans at the hands of the UN?
[00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:31.283]  Unbelievable.
[00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:32.043]  Wow.
[00:24:33.224 --> 00:24:37.128]  Meanwhile, every minute, every minute, they're killing another old person worldwide.
[00:24:37.528 --> 00:24:39.369]  Killing them in that shot and saying bye-bye.
[00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:45.354]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide, and next segment,
[00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:59.147]  I'm going to get into the fake trial and some of the incredible highlights of them lying and saying that Trump supporters burned down that church by the White House when it was BLM and Antifa that did it publicly and Trump made a huge deal about it.
[00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:03.871]  That's like Nadler saying Antifa is a myth.
[00:25:04.772 --> 00:25:07.575]  They do this as a disrespect to you on purpose.
[00:25:08.683 --> 00:25:10.744]  And they do it over and over again.
[00:25:10.784 --> 00:25:26.048]  But I just want to go back, because I'm going to really cover this in detail, and actually read to you from the CDC website, the reports, the actual reports of, they give the old man the shot, he has a convulsion, he's dead 15 minutes later.
[00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:29.169]  They give the old woman a shot, she's dead five minutes later.
[00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:36.692]  They give the old lady a shot, she passes out and is dead six hours later.
[00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:37.572]  I mean, it's all right here.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:47.002]  And these are, again, you'll notice it's like, wow, there's like 15 dead at this hospital, and 7 dead over here, and 3 dead here, and 4, and it's all over the world these are coming in.
[00:25:47.682 --> 00:25:49.102]  The CDC just does the U.S.
[00:25:51.563 --> 00:26:00.524]  And it's only certain nursing homes where people even care and go, uh, we're calling the government, we think the vaccine did it, adverse reaction, and then it even gets filed.
[00:26:01.084 --> 00:26:03.605]  They estimate that 1 out of 10, conservatively,
[00:26:05.051 --> 00:26:06.591]  of adverse reactions gets reported.
[00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:09.572]  A lot of doctors will tell you it's about one out of a hundred, probably, really.
[00:26:09.892 --> 00:26:15.774]  I mean, how many times do you take something and have an adverse reaction, and you call the CDC and tell them?
[00:26:16.554 --> 00:26:16.794]  Okay?
[00:26:17.214 --> 00:26:23.096]  So, thousands of dead people so far from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[00:26:23.476 --> 00:26:23.856]  Thousands.
[00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:27.417]  You count Europe, the U.S., Australia.
[00:26:27.437 --> 00:26:32.578]  I mean, that's why England, just a few months ago,
[00:26:37.566 --> 00:26:37.786]  I don't
[00:26:58.248 --> 00:27:00.769]  Actually, the British government recommends that you don't above 75.
[00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:04.129]  Keep your damn business out of this!
[00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.090]  These are people I've known for years, but when it comes to this, they get really pissed off.
[00:27:10.511 --> 00:27:11.791]  I'll just say it, because I care about the lady.
[00:27:12.231 --> 00:27:20.974]  My wife's mother just beat breast cancer, and they wanted to give her even way bigger regimens than they recommend, because she's so submissive to the system.
[00:27:21.034 --> 00:27:22.074]  She's a nice lady, but man.
[00:27:23.086 --> 00:27:25.428]  And she's a smart lady, but she still just believes in the system.
[00:27:25.648 --> 00:27:28.650]  And no matter how bad it is, she has to keep doubling down to the system.
[00:27:31.372 --> 00:27:35.455]  And my wife's sister's not taking it.
[00:27:35.495 --> 00:27:37.817]  She's a big liberal, but she's heard about the bad stuff.
[00:27:37.837 --> 00:27:38.397]  She's not taking it.
[00:27:38.738 --> 00:27:43.621]  But her mom took the first round, and her daughter told her, hey, please read the literature and be careful.
[00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:45.423]  And she said, don't you lecture me!
[00:27:45.443 --> 00:27:46.383]  And she never gets like that.
[00:27:46.964 --> 00:27:50.987]  Because people cannot believe under the Stockholm Syndrome this is happening to them.
[00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:52.228]  So see, this is a plan.
[00:27:53.738 --> 00:28:18.330]  Once they get hospitals in five states that are now killing babies after they're born and they sign a resuscitation order saying we are not resuscitating, the baby's alive, that's a legalese term now, not of turning the heart or lungs back on with defibrillators or mouth-to-mouth, or with hand pressure, because it's ganglia of nerves in the heart that can be jolted through the muscle.
[00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.991]  You jolt the muscle, it's electrochemical, you can get it going.
[00:28:22.478 --> 00:28:23.719]  That's not the resuscitation.
[00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:27.823]  In the legalese, in the legal parlance, it means we don't count this as a human.
[00:28:29.264 --> 00:28:30.625]  We decide this is not viable.
[00:28:30.945 --> 00:28:32.447]  Totally healthy babies in many cases.
[00:28:33.868 --> 00:28:38.912]  This isn't like the Spartans, well, this one's got two heads, throw it off the edge of the cliff into the ocean, which they did.
[00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:43.416]  That's where eugenics comes from, is that, you know, Greeks started officially doing it.
[00:28:44.337 --> 00:28:45.698]  And it certainly had an effect.
[00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:48.881]  There weren't any cripples around, because they'd kill your ass.
[00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:51.305]  I don't know.
[00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:10.074]  This is going on, and this is what the globalists follow, and this is what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:16.479]  But they're not just gonna kill the old people, they're gonna shoot you up with this, and it's got a bunch of evil effects.
[00:29:16.879 --> 00:29:25.005]  Attacks your fertility, attacks your testicles, attacks your ovaries, and does a bunch of other really, really bad stuff, according to top scientists that have looked at it.
[00:29:25.265 --> 00:29:29.508]  And remember, they skipped all of the trials.
[00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:33.391]  They skipped all of the trials.
[00:29:34.824 --> 00:29:36.745]  And they told you, oh, we didn't even do animal trials.
[00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:37.426]  That's not true.
[00:29:38.307 --> 00:29:42.570]  There's hundreds of patents we've seen of these mRNA vaccines for COVID.
[00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.092]  They've been studying it like mad for decades.
[00:29:45.132 --> 00:29:45.912]  This was their move.
[00:29:46.353 --> 00:29:48.654]  And they put five different viruses into this.
[00:29:49.095 --> 00:29:52.397]  And we already know some of the bad stuff it does to us in the vaccine.
[00:29:52.437 --> 00:29:57.521]  It's the vaccine that is going to cause all the problems.
[00:29:59.045 --> 00:30:03.167]  And so, on so many levels, ladies and gentlemen, this is just the end.
[00:30:03.187 --> 00:30:13.253]  I mean, this is absolute modern warfare, censoring anybody that exposes it, going after everybody, but there's still adverse reaction reports.
[00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:14.554]  Now they're moving.
[00:30:14.594 --> 00:30:18.696]  Big Pharma had a bill introduced last year to just stop the reporting completely.
[00:30:19.816 --> 00:30:25.940]  They already stopped doctors speaking out online, or on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube, and now they don't even want the adverse reports.
[00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:29.181]  What did Venezuela do five years ago?
[00:30:29.221 --> 00:30:33.526]  They passed a law that you cannot release the number of people that die of starvation each week.
[00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:35.508]  Back then it was about 2,000 a week.
[00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.331]  God knows what it is now.
[00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:44.137]  Ten years ago they'd already eaten all the animals at the zoo.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.922]  There isn't a pigeon?
[00:30:49.858 --> 00:30:55.820]  There isn't a dog, there isn't a lizard, there isn't a cat in the capital of Venezuela walking around.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.941]  They were all eaten a long time ago, just like North Korea.
[00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:07.484]  And they're sitting on top of all that oil, and all that gold, and all those emeralds, and all that timber, and all that beef, and all that.
[00:31:07.524 --> 00:31:10.705]  They were the richest country in Latin America until communism came.
[00:31:11.746 --> 00:31:14.867]  Oh, and it wasn't called communism at first, and it's all run by the big banks.
[00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:15.887]  They run the whole show.
[00:31:16.968 --> 00:31:17.988]  And now they're bringing that here.
[00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:22.605]  You know what I'll do?
[00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:40.413]  I'll cover the trial next hour and get to all these incredible clips and I'll read to you out of this report here where the Democrats have announced their big think tank plan of how they're going to deprogram us and re-educate us and also prosecute their operations against us.
[00:31:40.873 --> 00:31:49.057]  And it ties into that very important seven and a half minute piece that we put out on Monday titled, The End Game Is Here, or The End Game Is Now.
[00:31:50.762 --> 00:31:51.782]  The endgame is now.
[00:31:51.802 --> 00:31:52.563]  Endgame now.
[00:31:53.183 --> 00:32:08.167]  And I hope you share that because that's seven and a half minutes of the Democrat globalist leader saying we're gonna come and we're gonna arrest you and we're gonna kill you and we're gonna take your guns and we're gonna re-educate those that are allowed to live and we're gonna take all your speech and you have no freedom and we're the good guys.
[00:32:09.974 --> 00:32:14.056]  You don't just think they're saying all that because they're planning to play tiddlywinks with us.
[00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:15.856]  Or maybe a game of horseshoes.
[00:32:16.537 --> 00:32:18.197]  Maybe they want to play a game of go fish with us.
[00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:19.258]  Really nice people.
[00:32:19.818 --> 00:32:23.180]  They're killing old people everywhere.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.402]  With the COVID mRNA vaccines as the primary target.
[00:32:30.123 --> 00:32:31.603]  And then you look at what else it does.
[00:32:31.923 --> 00:32:33.224]  Holy mackerel.
[00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:43.914]  When you come across a COVID virus, the most common in the world, coronavirus, in the future, most people will have a violent autoimmune reaction.
[00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:48.618]  And they're gonna call that COVID 2022, probably be the name.
[00:32:49.379 --> 00:32:51.241]  I think it'll be about 2022 they'll hit us with it.
[00:32:51.401 --> 00:32:52.942]  Maybe sooner, hell, maybe next month.
[00:32:54.504 --> 00:32:55.985]  And it'll be everybody dying.
[00:32:57.046 --> 00:32:58.308]  Oh, by the way, that's what I didn't tell you.
[00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:05.245]  Most of these old people that died, they said, had already tested positive for COVID.
[00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:07.707]  Obviously, most of that's fraud, but that's the thing.
[00:33:08.187 --> 00:33:19.235]  They also said, that's what Wolfgang Woodhark, another scientist, said, they said, if you've already had a similar COVID virus or coronavirus, the same family, or COVID-19, the vaccine may cause an autoimmune response and kill you.
[00:33:20.086 --> 00:33:21.107]  Or make you very sick.
[00:33:21.947 --> 00:33:25.209]  Or later, it'll cause the autoimmune response when you come in contact with one.
[00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:27.030]  I mean, this is a death sentence!
[00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.170]  Total death sentence!
[00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:31.192]  And there'll just be people dying all around you!
[00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:34.534]  It'll just be Bill Gates up there smiling like a psychotic at you!
[00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:37.776]  I mean, they're never gonna get away with this!
[00:33:38.096 --> 00:33:38.496]  Never!
[00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:39.717]  They're crazy!
[00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:41.258]  But Hitler didn't get away with it either!
[00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:42.739]  But he wanted to kill everybody!
[00:33:43.179 --> 00:33:43.659]  That's right.
[00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:46.100]  The children of the New World Order are insane.
[00:33:46.541 --> 00:33:48.622]  The wages of sin is death.
[00:33:50.469 --> 00:34:03.735]  Waiting to be cleansed away by us breathing goodness and love and energy back into the world and just steadfastly opposing these evil people and praying for God to bring judgment upon them.
[00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:14.180]  But just as importantly, have us live our own lives separate from these monsters and realizing what horrible criminals they are and how evil their minions are.
[00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:21.604]  Because they've now spiritually converted from the top very close to the bottom most of their operatives.
[00:34:23.966 --> 00:34:40.980]  People that even meant well and had somewhat of a connection to God before have hated Trump so much that they were programmed with the more high-tech media brainwashing and subliminals to now support any form of tyranny imaginable because they feel like they are part of the power structure even though they're not.
[00:34:42.885 --> 00:34:45.046]  All right, look, here's the deal.
[00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:50.109]  I got so upset reading this nursing home death news, which I already knew, but it's much worse than I even thought.
[00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:51.570]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.250]  It's confirmed they're killing everybody.
[00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.251]  This is what the scientists said.
[00:34:55.291 --> 00:34:59.914]  The British government got advisory by their top board, said, stop giving it to 75 and up.
[00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:01.034]  Don't give it to pregnant women.
[00:35:02.335 --> 00:35:03.436]  Don't give it to people under 16.
[00:35:07.682 --> 00:35:09.323]  Instead, it's like, I'm a female doctor.
[00:35:09.463 --> 00:35:10.083]  I'm taking it.
[00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:11.024]  I'm six months pregnant.
[00:35:11.244 --> 00:35:12.464]  Well, my baby died.
[00:35:12.524 --> 00:35:13.005]  It's okay.
[00:35:13.045 --> 00:35:13.605]  I'm proud of it.
[00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:16.206]  I mean, these people are into it.
[00:35:16.226 --> 00:35:17.267]  Like, I'm macho.
[00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:17.907]  I'm taking it.
[00:35:18.127 --> 00:35:20.448]  Well, it doesn't protect you and causes all sorts of problems.
[00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:21.509]  It won't stop you getting COVID.
[00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:22.389]  I don't care!
[00:35:22.409 --> 00:35:24.250]  I want a passport to be able to travel!
[00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:29.493]  Well, actually, the places that stay open have less COVID cases, and most COVID cases are fake.
[00:35:29.913 --> 00:35:31.454]  You know, you need to be silenced right now.
[00:35:33.962 --> 00:35:38.925]  So I'm going to hit some more of this right now and actually read you some of the numbers and then we're going to go on a break and I'm going to be good and I'm going to play you.
[00:35:39.345 --> 00:35:41.286]  Lindsey Graham saying, what did Pelosi know?
[00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.527]  When did she know it about the riot?
[00:35:42.587 --> 00:35:43.268]  That's the key.
[00:35:43.568 --> 00:35:44.448]  Get on the offense.
[00:35:44.548 --> 00:35:45.869]  Why would Lindsey Graham do that suddenly?
[00:35:46.189 --> 00:35:46.890]  I'll tell you why.
[00:35:48.491 --> 00:35:54.834]  And this incredible brainwashing plan to quote, deprogram Trump supporters, de-Trumpification.
[00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:56.435]  Wait till I read this to you.
[00:35:57.876 --> 00:36:00.538]  It'd be like if you were trying to sound like you were a tyrant.
[00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:06.303]  In 1984, you would say stuff like this, but you're like, why are they being so tyrannical?
[00:36:06.924 --> 00:36:09.705]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, that is the plan.
[00:36:10.706 --> 00:36:12.867]  They can't hide it once you get to operational level.
[00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:13.907]  You have to emerge.
[00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:17.709]  Separately, I love the crew.
[00:36:17.749 --> 00:36:18.369]  They're awesome.
[00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:25.273]  And every time the Democrats file these lawsuits on us, they're always saying, who does your marketing and tell me
[00:36:26.673 --> 00:36:28.355]  Who is telling you what to say?
[00:36:28.515 --> 00:36:29.636]  Who is in charge?
[00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:30.757]  Because they are all minions.
[00:36:31.138 --> 00:36:32.079]  They're not their own people.
[00:36:32.819 --> 00:36:34.962]  And people always go, oh, Jones does it all.
[00:36:34.982 --> 00:36:35.943]  Where's the business plan?
[00:36:37.064 --> 00:36:37.985]  Well, here's an example.
[00:36:39.446 --> 00:36:41.348]  Rocket Rest is a super bestseller.
[00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.190]  Turns out it's sold out in a month.
[00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.695]  It's super strong sleep aid, even stronger than Knockout, which is excellent that I designed.
[00:36:48.851 --> 00:36:50.032]  So different strokes, different folks.
[00:36:50.332 --> 00:36:51.392]  The knockout is in stock.
[00:36:51.712 --> 00:36:54.393]  And no one told me for four or five months when I was plugging it that we don't have it.
[00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:54.994]  It was sold out.
[00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:56.654]  More comes in like three weeks.
[00:36:57.595 --> 00:36:58.535]  That's a perfect example.
[00:36:59.335 --> 00:37:04.538]  I've been plugging, so we need to kind of get, I guess, the marketing department to tell me when stuff's sold out.
[00:37:05.258 --> 00:37:10.020]  I've been plugging Alexa Pure high quality water filtration systems for six months.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.501]  And they've been sold out for six months.
[00:37:13.121 --> 00:37:13.542]  Sorry.
[00:37:13.902 --> 00:37:16.563]  I know a lot of you probably went there like, oh, why is it sold out?
[00:37:18.956 --> 00:37:27.020]  Because the marketing just consists of me saying, you need to filter your water, this is the highest rated, it's very high quality, and it funds our operation.
[00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:31.523]  But nobody told me that it was sold out, and I'm not complaining, it's just that that's what's going on.
[00:37:33.424 --> 00:37:42.888]  So, all of it is back in stock, and they've got shower filters, and they've got tabletop pitchers, and they've got everything.
[00:37:43.169 --> 00:37:44.749]  And it's all back in stock, and it's $50.
[00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:47.404]  Dollars off.
[00:37:47.684 --> 00:37:51.907]  You're not going to get anything stainless steel anywhere near this quality with this level of filtration.
[00:37:51.947 --> 00:37:55.669]  And people always go and check and they go, wow, this is actually the highest rated unit.
[00:37:56.429 --> 00:37:59.491]  And then the other company you sell is also super high rated.
[00:38:02.033 --> 00:38:03.674]  And why do you have the highest rated?
[00:38:04.374 --> 00:38:05.815]  Well, because we go out and find the highest rated.
[00:38:05.835 --> 00:38:06.476]  We bring those to you.
[00:38:07.576 --> 00:38:08.657]  So these are the highest rated.
[00:38:09.598 --> 00:38:11.619]  All the stuff we've got in there is the very best you can find.
[00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:14.201]  And strangely enough, it's way lower than crap that isn't as good.
[00:38:14.997 --> 00:38:16.278]  That's how so much stuff operates.
[00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:23.943]  So, it's $50 off, and you are not going to find a better deal on one of these big, nice units.
[00:38:24.483 --> 00:38:27.125]  This is what I use out at the cabin.
[00:38:27.765 --> 00:38:29.447]  This is what I use in the RV.
[00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:33.809]  This is what we tend to use as the backup at the house, or that we drink out of.
[00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:35.971]  Also, I'll just be honest with you, I like premium spring water.
[00:38:36.271 --> 00:38:37.572]  It's so delicious out of Arkansas.
[00:38:37.592 --> 00:38:39.173]  I also drink some Italian water.
[00:38:39.193 --> 00:38:42.415]  I mean, I can just taste how good it is, but this is what I cook with.
[00:38:42.435 --> 00:38:43.055]  This is what I use.
[00:38:43.336 --> 00:38:43.656]  It's great.
[00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:47.247]  You can't really do reverse osmosis.
[00:38:47.307 --> 00:38:49.628]  It makes the water totally clean, but takes out all the minerals.
[00:38:49.668 --> 00:38:50.849]  This leaves the good minerals in.
[00:38:51.169 --> 00:38:52.150]  So it's back in stock.
[00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.291]  $50 off on the Alexa Pure.
[00:38:57.645 --> 00:38:59.966]  Water filtration system.
[00:39:00.006 --> 00:39:02.308]  And that's their big Alexa Pure Pro system.
[00:39:02.568 --> 00:39:04.529]  We got a bunch of the other ones that are discounted as well.
[00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:06.630]  Different shapes and sizes.
[00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.172]  And there's a couple other brands of water filters that are also high rated.
[00:39:10.232 --> 00:39:12.113]  But we're really partnered with Alexa Pure.
[00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:13.974]  That's how we can give you the lowest price that anybody gets.
[00:39:14.054 --> 00:39:15.555]  It's the same folks that own My Patriot Supply.
[00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:18.677]  Continuing, Winter Sun has been sold out.
[00:39:19.077 --> 00:39:23.120]  A limited supply came in because of all the different COVID restrictions and lockdowns.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.240]  It's very hard to get the supplements.
[00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:26.162]  But it did come in 25% off.
[00:39:26.182 --> 00:39:31.685]  Get it 40% off when you get it with Ultra 12, our super high quality vitamin B12 taken under the tongue.
[00:39:32.946 --> 00:39:34.227]  Those go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:39:34.387 --> 00:39:41.032]  And you can get Ultra 12 by itself for 50% off because there's not a shortage of that right now.
[00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.453]  But costs are going up for us.
[00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:45.815]  Availability is going up for us of not just the ingredients, but the packaging.
[00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:49.378]  So it's all there.
[00:39:49.538 --> 00:39:52.360]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.981]  And also Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is sold out.
[00:39:57.001 --> 00:39:58.362]  95% are humanoid.
[00:39:58.402 --> 00:39:59.582]  Leading competitors are 3-5%.
[00:39:59.723 --> 00:40:01.223]  It's the strongest one out there.
[00:40:01.363 --> 00:40:01.983]  It's sold out.
[00:40:02.424 --> 00:40:03.684]  We don't know when we're getting more of that.
[00:40:03.764 --> 00:40:04.645]  We're fighting to get it.
[00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:10.767]  We have the liquid turmeric extract that is a different formula but extremely strong as well.
[00:40:11.227 --> 00:40:12.588]  Very high level curcuminoid.
[00:40:13.468 --> 00:40:18.891]  But it's done by our traditional fashion of concentrating so you can't technically read the curcuminoid level accurately.
[00:40:18.931 --> 00:40:20.792]  So we just don't tell you the curcuminoid level because we don't know.
[00:40:21.032 --> 00:40:28.135]  We just know it's a super strong proprietary long-term benchmark product that we are allowed to private label from a top company.
[00:40:28.835 --> 00:40:34.216]  So, pure turmeric extract, 100% reviews, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:40:34.496 --> 00:40:36.757]  Without you, we will not be here on air.
[00:40:37.517 --> 00:40:40.958]  So, the Alexa Pure Water Filtration, back in stock, and so much more.
[00:40:41.598 --> 00:40:43.759]  Also, a lot of stuff that's selling out, but still on sale.
[00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:53.521]  DNA Force Plus, liquid pure turmeric, 50% off, lung cleanse, nascent iodine surface spray, and more activated charcoal toothpaste, back in stock.
[00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:56.822]  Highest quality, and these are just all highest quality, developed by my dad.
[00:40:58.942 --> 00:41:03.046]  And I guess in-game, Blue River Global Enslavement, banned off of Amazon, is available again.
[00:41:03.066 --> 00:41:05.188]  I guess we did print more of those up, so good job to the crew.
[00:41:05.248 --> 00:41:08.411]  I was like through a fit, I guess a year ago, saying, I want that printed.
[00:41:08.431 --> 00:41:09.111]  I want more.
[00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:13.215]  And so I ran around like an angry duck, because I guess I am in charge.
[00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:17.519]  And we do have those now available back on the site.
[00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:19.881]  I guess it was out of stock for so long, we had to relaunch it.
[00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:24.885]  That's why there's only five reviews, because it just came, or 57 reviews, because it just came back in.
[00:41:25.546 --> 00:41:28.547]  The classic film, you watch it, you'll be like, man, did the guy have a time machine?
[00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:30.868]  No, the globalists were very public about all they're doing.
[00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:32.429]  So I'm done plugging.
[00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:35.110]  It's just that without you, we're not going to be here.
[00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.311]  We're not going to be able to expose this.
[00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:39.752]  And the globalists have bit off a lot more than they can chew.
[00:41:39.912 --> 00:41:40.973]  I know why they've launched.
[00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:43.243]  This deadly COVID operation.
[00:41:43.303 --> 00:41:46.264]  I know why they're launching a vaccine that's clearly going to kill so many people.
[00:41:46.724 --> 00:41:52.085]  Because I've learned about their dark philosophy and how their weird psychology works.
[00:41:52.905 --> 00:41:56.986]  And it's very important for us to lay this out because I've not heard anyone else understands this.
[00:41:57.806 --> 00:41:59.987]  And that's why they don't like me and why they want me off air.
[00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:05.028]  And that's why they also keep coming to me and wanting to know who's telling me all this stuff.
[00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:07.716]  I mean, I study this stuff all day long.
[00:42:07.816 --> 00:42:08.978]  I know you guys better than you do.
[00:42:09.558 --> 00:42:10.879]  And I'm not, I'm not bragging.
[00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:12.661]  The famous Alex Jones saying, I'm not bragging.
[00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:15.543]  It's just, I really do know what I'm talking about.
[00:42:16.164 --> 00:42:20.428]  The problem is I get so angry when I kind of heads up display all this stuff in my mind.
[00:42:20.468 --> 00:42:28.615]  I could see it all very clearly that I think it's going to a rage or want to go crawl in a hole somewhere because it's so horrible.
[00:42:29.235 --> 00:42:31.858]  But I'm going to tell you again, the only way of getting out of this,
[00:42:33.826 --> 00:42:35.835]  Is realizing that you've got to do it.
[00:42:36.739 --> 00:42:37.945]  And you're not going to make it out if you don't.
[00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:38.728]  It's like those divers.
[00:42:40.305 --> 00:42:51.088]  In Indonesia or wherever it was, where the thing caved in and the kids were in the cave and it flooded and the kids got in and they had to have divers go hundreds of yards in tiny little two-foot spaces in pitch black.
[00:42:51.428 --> 00:42:54.649]  They had to drug the kids and take them all out.
[00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:55.909]  I mean, incredibly heroic.
[00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.570]  Incredibly amazing.
[00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.991]  You think any of the globalists would act like that to save somebody?
[00:43:01.031 --> 00:43:02.511]  No, they want to play God and kill everybody.
[00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:04.452]  They've gotten rid of their responsibility.
[00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:14.854]  So I liken the claustrophobia of this and what we're having to do admitting this to ourselves is like having to underwater spelunk through this because you don't have a choice.
[00:43:16.255 --> 00:43:23.157]  Those kids are trapped in there and it's your job as a deep water hazard diver to do this so gut up and do it.
[00:43:23.718 --> 00:43:25.999]  And they did it and that's why humans are so incredible.
[00:43:27.399 --> 00:43:29.060]  To overcome the fear and do stuff like that.
[00:43:30.151 --> 00:43:35.555]  And that's where we've got to get back to that point and stand up against the evil and realize we're all trapped in this globalist system.
[00:43:35.575 --> 00:43:37.997]  We're not getting out of here without facing the facts.
[00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:39.178]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:39.198 --> 00:43:39.618]  Stay with us.
[00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:49.746]  We've got a special report here dealing with the occult symbolism at the Super Bowl that we're going to be playing here in about 45 seconds.
[00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:55.791]  And then I'm going to try to control myself and be a really good boy and cover all of the incredible
[00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:14.619]  New World Order trial, demonization of the American people, indictment of our republic, basically the introduction that the American people are terrorists and loving America is illegal, and just all these declarations of war being made by the collaborator globalist operatives about how they plan to come after all of us.
[00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:16.000]  And they're doing that because they're very, very weak.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:22.564]  They're doing that because they're in deep trouble and they had to steal this election and their whole system is falling apart.
[00:44:22.984 --> 00:44:24.925]  So here's the report on the Super Bowl and we'll be right back.
[00:44:25.712 --> 00:44:44.170]  Ever since God confused the languages during the building of the Tower of Babel, occultists around the world and throughout the millennia have believed that symbols are a way to communicate without language, through those loose associations and interpretations.
[00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.696]  Although the results are cryptic and esoteric compared to the clearer communication of words.
[00:44:51.116 --> 00:45:03.269]  Even to this day, global elites and occultists who have inherited this tradition of symbology use this hidden language to convey messaging both to the indoctrinated and to the masses.
[00:45:03.709 --> 00:45:05.912]  During the Super Bowl halftime show,
[00:45:06.272 --> 00:45:25.480]  The Canadian musical group The Weeknd's performance starts as a demonic-looking being descends to the earth, and a robotic-looking choir of other demonic beings sing a portion of The Weeknd's song, Call Out My Name, where the chorus shouts, Why can't you wait till I fall?
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.981]  Is this a reference to Satan?
[00:45:28.281 --> 00:45:29.042]  Lucifer?
[00:45:29.222 --> 00:45:30.142]  Falling to earth?
[00:45:30.422 --> 00:45:34.084]  Where one-third of the angels of heaven fell along with him?
[00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:56.182]  The lead singer of The Weeknd then emerges from a pit between the fallen angels, with light surrounding him, where he sings a portion of the song Starboy, with lyrics such as, I come alive in the fall time, and a repetitive chorus mantra where he repeats, I'm a starboy, Satan, Lucifer,
[00:45:56.542 --> 00:46:06.910]  Also known as the Morning Star, fell to Earth because he sinned, and he spreads his false light of sin to mankind in an attempt to eclipse God's light.
[00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:11.273]  Is that what these symbols are referencing in the language of the occult?
[00:46:11.713 --> 00:46:27.506]  In a 2017 concert at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen, Denmark, the word Satan undeniably appears on the screen behind the weekend stage, revealing a clear goal of inserting subliminal messages to their audience.
[00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:30.968]  Is this just a coincidence to the halftime show?
[00:46:31.229 --> 00:46:38.995]  Before the music even begins, there's an opening shot of the lead singer driving through a stage set of Las Vegas.
[00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:46.142]  Commonly known as Sin City, with a globe on a pillar to his left, a very common occultic symbol.
[00:46:46.302 --> 00:46:54.391]  This could be referring to the Twin Pillars, which in American Rite Masonry are most often seen with a ball or globe on top.
[00:46:54.751 --> 00:47:00.855]  One holding fire, the other water, symbolizing the divine and earthly aspects of men.
[00:47:01.075 --> 00:47:12.422]  With one pillar depicted here, it's possible that this is meant to symbolize the unification of church and state, the divine and the earthly, and the creation of a one world order.
[00:47:12.702 --> 00:47:22.804]  Similar to the occultic symbology expressed by the destruction of the Twin Towers, only to be replaced by the One World Trade Center, a single tower.
[00:47:23.144 --> 00:47:36.267]  Aside from the esoteric symbols used to convey meaning, there are also ideas implanted into the audience's mind in plain English, with phrases such as, feel nothing, gone, your mind.
[00:47:36.827 --> 00:47:39.891]  Alone, you lose and sin.
[00:47:40.231 --> 00:47:57.129]  So a sinful city, a 21st century Babylon, with a One World Tower, a new Tower of Babel, followed by Lucifer descending to the earth, alongside the other rebellious angels who rejected God, as a figure emerges from beneath them.
[00:47:57.529 --> 00:48:00.691]  Enveloped in light, the false light of Lucifer?
[00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:01.972]  What does it all mean?
[00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:07.255]  Are these symbols meant to convey an esoteric message to an intended audience?
[00:48:07.615 --> 00:48:09.336]  Directly or indirectly?
[00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:12.078]  Or are they just meaningless symbols?
[00:48:12.418 --> 00:48:17.822]  Like seeing shapes or figures in the clouds and analyzing them as a fruitless endeavor?
[00:48:18.122 --> 00:48:20.964]  If not, what are these occultists trying to say?
[00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.765]  And who are they trying to speak to?
[00:48:23.125 --> 00:48:26.247]  This is Brian Wilson with Info Wars.
[00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:27.888]  Oh, they're telling you you're a slave.
[00:48:27.908 --> 00:48:28.629]  They're gonna kill you.
[00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:29.690]  They're announcing themselves.
[00:48:30.511 --> 00:48:31.712]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:33.154 --> 00:48:37.198]  We are now into the second hour of this February 11th, Thursday, global transmission.
[00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:37.598]  The year is 2021.
[00:48:37.638 --> 00:48:42.623]  I want to lay out what the trial
[00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:57.103]  In the Senate is, and I want to lay out what its goals are and how that unfolding operation can be extremely informative to all of us about the shape of things to come.
[00:48:57.123 --> 00:49:01.084]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones, very honored that you've joined us here today.
[00:49:01.464 --> 00:49:03.625]  Let me show you some of these exhibits first and I'll go through them.
[00:49:05.103 --> 00:49:08.265]  So a Chris Manahan article from InformationLiberation.com.
[00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:09.986]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:11.927]  Detrumpification.
[00:49:12.007 --> 00:49:18.590]  Media lays out plan to deprogram Trump supporters from their extremist views.
[00:49:20.211 --> 00:49:24.533]  That then ties into this key article by Steve Watson at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:27.595 --> 00:49:31.156]  Senator Graham asked, what did Pelosi know about the Capitol riot?
[00:49:31.216 --> 00:49:32.157]  When did she know it?
[00:49:32.197 --> 00:49:34.078]  This is extremely important.
[00:49:36.417 --> 00:49:50.141]  And it ties in to the Time Magazine article from a week ago, a week ago tomorrow, where they admit that they set us up at the Capitol.
[00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:52.682]  Why would they do such a thing?
[00:49:52.802 --> 00:49:56.983]  Because they're proud of themselves, and they want to celebrate what they did.
[00:49:58.103 --> 00:50:01.344]  They feel like they've censored everybody so much, they can just rub it in.
[00:50:03.652 --> 00:50:06.454]  So that is all coming up.
[00:50:06.735 --> 00:50:11.259]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Lindsey Graham talking about this.
[00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:13.200]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.481]  Very hard to find this clip.
[00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:15.622]  It got almost no coverage.
[00:50:15.642 --> 00:50:15.963]  Here it is.
[00:50:16.835 --> 00:50:18.397]  New evidence makes you do that.
[00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:38.698]  The only reason they're trying to create this bizarre storyline that Trump was in on it, along with Dan Scavino, is that we now know, after impeachment, that was done without a lawyer, without a hearing, without any witnesses, that the FBI and the Capitol Hill police actually now understand this was pre-planned.
[00:50:40.678 --> 00:50:48.521]  The whole storyline that Donald Trump caused this by his speech has fallen apart due to good law enforcement activity.
[00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:49.941]  Here's what I want to know.
[00:50:50.561 --> 00:50:53.022]  What did Nancy Pelosi know and when did she know it?
[00:50:53.442 --> 00:51:03.785]  If this was widely known by the FBI and Capitol Hill Police that people were planning to come to Washington before the 6th to create violence, I want to know, did she know about that?
[00:51:04.285 --> 00:51:08.391]  The whole storyline originally was Trump created this from a speech.
[00:51:08.852 --> 00:51:17.704]  Now we know the people had this on their mind before he ever spoke, so they're playing this bizarre game of trying to get Trump in on it before January the 6th.
[00:51:18.084 --> 00:51:20.307]  This is why you don't want to have snap impeachments.
[00:51:21.581 --> 00:51:25.442]  Now when I say that's hard to find, that was on Sean Hannity, but just no news coverage of that.
[00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:29.684]  That's a big deal to have one of the most powerful Republicans in the Senate telling the truth.
[00:51:30.204 --> 00:51:31.745]  That's why I've been harping on this.
[00:51:31.765 --> 00:51:35.506]  People are like, man, this happened at the Capitol back on the 6th of January.
[00:51:36.767 --> 00:51:37.547]  It's two months ago.
[00:51:39.397 --> 00:51:40.377]  Why are you harping on it?
[00:51:40.417 --> 00:51:54.463]  Because it's about framing the whole country, saying we're domestic terrorists, we're insurgents, that it was an insurrection, that it was this incredible assault, as bad as a million Christians killed in Rwanda by the UN under Clinton command.
[00:51:54.483 --> 00:51:55.604]  That's what they're actually saying.
[00:51:56.924 --> 00:51:59.906]  As bad as Pearl Harbor, as bad as 9-11.
[00:51:59.946 --> 00:52:03.027]  It's just absolutely
[00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:05.106]  Outrageous.
[00:52:06.127 --> 00:52:08.429]  And there was a consortium of groups.
[00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:10.792]  I'm not saying you're bad if you're in the Boogaloo Boys.
[00:52:11.353 --> 00:52:13.455]  I'm not saying you're bad if you're in the Proud Boys.
[00:52:14.036 --> 00:52:22.645]  I'm not saying you're bad if you were just a random Q person and were believing that this was the big assault and you were going to go in and walk around inside the velvet ropes.
[00:52:24.065 --> 00:52:26.227]  Some people rub poo on the walls and the rest of it.
[00:52:26.287 --> 00:52:31.011]  I mean, it was a very small minority of angry, pissed off people out of a million folks that showed up.
[00:52:31.091 --> 00:52:37.616]  And we have to expose that because when they have this trial, it's a sham because Trump can't find real lawyers that aren't cowards.
[00:52:40.659 --> 00:52:44.101]  We don't have that many good men in positions of power anymore.
[00:52:44.141 --> 00:52:45.863]  They're a bunch of backscratching cowards.
[00:52:47.945 --> 00:52:51.788]  And so very tiny minority of people engaged in violence haven't even
[00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:55.464]  Smaller minority that actually hurt anybody.
[00:52:56.485 --> 00:52:59.570]  And that was a tiny minority of a minority that was there in D.C.
[00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:00.672]  And I know you know that.
[00:53:01.553 --> 00:53:05.378]  But the whole thing is about projecting that onto us.
[00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:17.236]  And saying that we're this new political class that must be deplatformed, have our bank accounts taken, that need to be drone-striked, that need to be put in prison.
[00:53:17.496 --> 00:53:20.458]  I mean, the things that come out of their mouth are outrageous!
[00:53:21.319 --> 00:53:28.504]  And it's former CIA directors and current counter-terrorism heads, and all of them openly declaring war on us.
[00:53:28.524 --> 00:53:30.806]  This is just spectacular!
[00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:39.706]  I mean, the video that I just keep talking about, it's only got a half million views, it needs 50 million views to turn the country and the world around, is in game now.
[00:53:40.727 --> 00:53:41.607]  In Band.Video.
[00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:43.628]  Band.Video in the Gregory section.
[00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:51.273]  And they just, it's seven and a half minutes of them just as fast as they can talk, saying this, and they're trying to do it.
[00:53:52.033 --> 00:53:59.277]  They're moving with laser-like speed to start disrupting and rounding up, and we need to use drones to kill Trump supporters.
[00:54:02.532 --> 00:54:07.817]  A level of demonization that is cartoonish until you realize they mean business.
[00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:21.890]  Because they've committed such giant crimes and there is a global government openly announcing itself and they need to end the dollar as the world reserve currency and bring in the new global digital currency which will be based on Bitcoin.
[00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.471]  Which again is obviously a giant inside job from the beginning just like you.
[00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:29.273]  And I told you that 10 years ago and now you can see it.
[00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:31.494]  The system's gonna adopt it and totally accept it.
[00:54:31.974 --> 00:54:33.475]  And those who invest in it will do quite well.
[00:54:33.975 --> 00:54:44.259]  But then if you don't serve the new world order in the future with any of these new cryptocurrencies, they'll cut you off and have a complete blockchain of where you had it and what you did and everything you ever spent it on.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.981]  Just like your surfing history and everything else.
[00:54:49.582 --> 00:54:52.063]  It's money with its surfing history.
[00:54:53.473 --> 00:54:55.356]  And so congratulations, Bitcoin folks.
[00:54:55.456 --> 00:54:57.398]  It's now going to be king daddy of everything.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.022]  And we said that a long time ago, too.
[00:55:00.062 --> 00:55:02.625]  We just said, it's like Soron's ring.
[00:55:04.248 --> 00:55:09.114]  He gives you these lesser rings because he has the one ring that binds it and tracks it and controls it.
[00:55:09.675 --> 00:55:10.916]  And that's what the technocracy is.
[00:55:12.216 --> 00:55:19.022]  And all these people are battling to be in control when the AI goes totally operational and takes everything over.
[00:55:19.123 --> 00:55:29.612]  We're then locked in our homes, the robots rise, then the real bioweapons are released, and by then we're so used to people dying of cancer and old people dying and all the rest of it that we just go along with it.
[00:55:31.174 --> 00:55:33.596]  So, here is
[00:55:35.441 --> 00:55:41.243]  Kamala Harris, cackling like the witch she is, talking about killing Trump.
[00:55:41.524 --> 00:55:43.865]  Will she be impeached?
[00:55:43.885 --> 00:55:44.325]  Here it is.
[00:55:44.985 --> 00:55:49.707]  If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be?
[00:55:52.188 --> 00:55:53.669]  Does one of us have to come out alive?
[00:56:07.779 --> 00:56:08.160]  You know what?
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.481]  People think I was overdoing it.
[00:56:09.742 --> 00:56:11.464]  Play it again so you can hear the actual cackle.
[00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:13.607]  I mean, I hear they're coming out with the new Wizard of Oz.
[00:56:13.627 --> 00:56:15.369]  She's got the job as the Wicked Witch.
[00:56:15.409 --> 00:56:15.810]  Here it is.
[00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:20.816]  If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence, or Jeff Sessions, who would it be?
[00:56:20.836 --> 00:56:24.821]  Does one of us have to come out alive?
[00:56:37.152 --> 00:56:39.161]  Hey guys, don't loop it, just play it out.
[00:56:39.241 --> 00:56:40.769]  If she keeps going it gets worse.
[00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:41.813]  There it is.
[00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:51.860]  And now she says she wants you to be arrested as an insurgent because you support America existing.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.020]  No borders!
[00:56:53.301 --> 00:56:53.921]  No walls!
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:55.621]  No USA at all!
[00:56:55.961 --> 00:56:56.601]  No borders!
[00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:57.482]  No walls!
[00:56:57.782 --> 00:56:58.942]  No USA at all!
[00:56:59.002 --> 00:57:06.964]  Imagine the globalists just love her because she's totally fake, totally disingenuous, absolutely empty, pathetic and stupid.
[00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:09.577]  And stupid.
[00:57:09.797 --> 00:57:11.798]  And just look at all these sellouts.
[00:57:11.938 --> 00:57:13.560]  Colbert and her.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.181]  Oh, that woman she's on with.
[00:57:15.201 --> 00:57:18.443]  I remember her calling for drone striking us.
[00:57:19.964 --> 00:57:22.526]  I mean, hell, just all of them how they want to kill us all day long.
[00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:25.288]  Well, you're sure starting to fight with a bunch of iron people.
[00:57:27.089 --> 00:57:28.490]  But these are who sold us out.
[00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:29.171]  So when I come back,
[00:57:30.066 --> 00:57:40.172]  I'm going to hit the latest highlights of the trial and Trump's lawyers openly saying Trump deserved to be impeached or deserved to lose and just, I mean, they might as well just say, I want him convicted.
[00:57:40.552 --> 00:57:43.134]  Trump is a devil, remove him, arrest him.
[00:57:43.234 --> 00:57:47.857]  I mean, we're going to, and then lying and saying his supporters burned down a church.
[00:57:47.877 --> 00:57:49.638]  It's just all made up lies.
[00:57:50.198 --> 00:57:51.058]  We are back live.
[00:57:51.159 --> 00:57:53.340]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and let's get to the heart of the matter.
[00:57:55.097 --> 00:57:58.918]  There is a globalist takeover of the country and the world happening.
[00:57:59.458 --> 00:58:01.819]  There is a major rebellion and awakening to it.
[00:58:02.199 --> 00:58:13.063]  And they are openly saying they want to make it illegal to criticize the vaccines, illegal to criticize the lockdowns, illegal to criticize the troop deployments, illegal to criticize anything.
[00:58:14.003 --> 00:58:15.164]  Election fraud, you name it.
[00:58:15.524 --> 00:58:16.324]  It's terrorist.
[00:58:16.704 --> 00:58:22.066]  And they say, I'm going to read this, that Democrats, anyone criticizing anything they do,
[00:58:24.161 --> 00:58:27.423]  needs to be deplatformed and then prosecuted and arrested.
[00:58:27.743 --> 00:58:33.748]  And they're being advised by the big think tank in Germany that took the Germans' rights away.
[00:58:35.769 --> 00:58:40.052]  And they call it a Marshall Plan to stop the threat of domestic extremists.
[00:58:40.392 --> 00:58:41.693]  Now, what have I told you?
[00:58:41.853 --> 00:58:43.174]  We have an archive, let's see if they can find it.
[00:58:43.554 --> 00:58:50.379]  Probably 50 times I said, when they say they want a Marshall Plan in the U.S., that's the blueprint for the purge.
[00:58:51.578 --> 00:58:53.039]  I'm going to show you the document next segment.
[00:58:53.579 --> 00:58:57.901]  They are now saying that they're going to have a Marshall Plan.
[00:58:58.461 --> 00:59:04.823]  And they say they're going to re-educate us and they're going to take us to emergency centers.
[00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:09.325]  And you're hearing, well, for COVID and for other things, we've got to take you away.
[00:59:09.365 --> 00:59:16.068]  And all these college graduates from the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps and Obama Corps and the Global Clinton Initiative, where, I mean,
[00:59:17.179 --> 00:59:19.380]  There's millions of people in the Global Clinton Initiative.
[00:59:19.701 --> 00:59:20.841]  Millions in the Peace Corps.
[00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:23.403]  Millions in the Obama initiatives.
[00:59:24.684 --> 00:59:27.365]  They're all 20, 30, 40 years old now.
[00:59:28.686 --> 00:59:32.708]  And they're bringing in the next group of youth who are going to be given Maoist power.
[00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:38.512]  That's the official model of this cultural revolution we're about to go into.
[00:59:38.532 --> 00:59:39.893]  We're actually into the first part of it.
[00:59:41.174 --> 00:59:46.457]  Our leg is caught in its mouth right now and it's trying to, like a boa constrictor, get us all the way into the maw.
[00:59:48.325 --> 00:59:53.809]  So, you're in a struggle, you're in a death battle with a giant bow constrictor, you might want to just admit that to yourself and start getting out of it.
[00:59:54.449 --> 00:59:58.252]  Start politically gouging the eyes out, biting it, you know, trying to get it un-wrestled from you.
[00:59:59.512 --> 01:00:05.056]  And there's a lot of peaceful ways to do that, but you better get mobilized, you better get vocal, you better get aggressive.
[01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.799]  They want to just knock us down like dominoes.
[01:00:08.819 --> 01:00:09.959]  This isn't a probe.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.221]  This is the main move.
[01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.682]  It's all over the news.
[01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:17.364]  Firing squads, re-education camps, deprogram 75 million people.
[01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:24.791]  And now they're having Trump people go out and renounce themselves on CNN, New York Times, The Hill.
[01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:25.971]  I renounced myself.
[01:00:26.111 --> 01:00:26.932]  I was a racist.
[01:00:27.032 --> 01:00:27.852]  I was a Trump supporter.
[01:00:28.172 --> 01:00:29.213]  I renounced myself.
[01:00:29.273 --> 01:00:30.133]  I was a Q person.
[01:00:30.474 --> 01:00:31.654]  I renounced myself.
[01:00:31.914 --> 01:00:38.238]  It's all the same model they did in South Africa, the same model they did in Germany, same model they did in Russia, China.
[01:00:38.558 --> 01:00:38.938]  It's it!
[01:00:41.079 --> 01:00:44.521]  Now the same big rich bankers that own slave camps that are just laughing at you.
[01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:49.938]  PBS Lawyer says take people's children away and send the parents to re-education camps.
[01:00:49.958 --> 01:00:50.639]  That's the head lawyer.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.561]  Now, let's start getting to it.
[01:00:54.661 --> 01:01:01.765]  The slimiest rat-like creature I've seen in a while, Jamie Raskin, has been the leader of the persecution.
[01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:07.289]  He said that Trump supporters impaled police and stabbed them to death on the 6th.
[01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:10.991]  And that on the 6th, Trump supporters burned down a church.
[01:01:12.551 --> 01:01:16.013]  Well, it's funny because that church is the one that BLM firebombed.
[01:01:16.854 --> 01:01:24.739]  That church, ladies and gentlemen, is the church that Trump went and visited with the Bible.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.043]  Why would you tell such a gigantic lie out in the open?
[01:01:33.164 --> 01:01:35.065]  Why would you say that St.
[01:01:35.105 --> 01:01:37.126]  John's Church was burned by Trump supporters?
[01:01:40.048 --> 01:01:40.949]  That's like saying
[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:46.173]  That Abraham Lincoln killed Abraham Lincoln?
[01:01:46.753 --> 01:01:47.934]  No, John Wilkes Booth did.
[01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:52.358]  I mean, it's just, it's just a, it's like saying, my background, my background is red.
[01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:54.740]  And you're like, no, your background is green today.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:02.587]  I mean, he might as well just get up there and say, the sky is red at high noon in Texas.
[01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:04.451]  But again, why does he do that?
[01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.912]  Because he's a lying criminal.
[01:02:06.672 --> 01:02:08.253]  Everything comes out of his fat mouth's a lie.
[01:02:08.273 --> 01:02:10.174]  They put out all these fake videos, everything else.
[01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.695]  And his fake crying?
[01:02:12.156 --> 01:02:16.258]  He couldn't get an acting part in a third grader play with that kind of crap.
[01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:18.400]  Unless he played Pinocchio.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.761]  Looks like Pinocchio.
[01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:27.846]  So, here he is, Jamie Raskin, the main lawyer against Trump, Ratkin, and just listen to this BS.
[01:02:28.837 --> 01:02:36.713]  And that's before the second million MAGA march, a rally that ended in serious violence and even the burning of a church.
[01:02:37.735 --> 01:02:39.979]  And as the president forecast, it was only the beginning.
[01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:48.679]  On December 19th, 18 days before January 6th, he told his base about where the battle would be that they would fight next.
[01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.780]  January 6th would be wild, he promised.
[01:02:52.281 --> 01:02:52.781]  Be there.
[01:02:53.021 --> 01:02:56.522]  We'll be wild, said the President of the United States of America.
[01:02:57.263 --> 01:02:59.584]  And that, too, turned out to be true.
[01:03:00.164 --> 01:03:07.327]  You'll see in the days that followed, Donald Trump continued to aggressively promote January 6th to his followers.
[01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:19.971]  Okay, so he's saying that the march that we coordinated that was peaceful, that happened in December, was the June 1st BLM event that burned the church.
[01:03:20.932 --> 01:03:22.772]  I mean, it's like six months apart.
[01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:26.334]  And it's a public event that happened.
[01:03:26.694 --> 01:03:27.735]  Trump went and visited it.
[01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:28.795]  So what does this guy do?
[01:03:28.835 --> 01:03:29.675]  He inverts it.
[01:03:31.836 --> 01:03:32.857]  And says that we did it.
[01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:35.138]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[01:03:36.869 --> 01:03:38.549]  This is absolutely amazing.
[01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.450]  Now let's go to some more of this.
[01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.171]  This is a bunch of examples of this.
[01:03:43.271 --> 01:03:45.931]  Edited video, fake quotes they've had to admit weren't real.
[01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:49.232]  I mean, they're just making stuff up because their followers want to be part of a lie.
[01:03:49.252 --> 01:03:50.052]  They get into it.
[01:03:50.512 --> 01:03:59.094]  They're still all over the news saying, look, here's Jones and Ali Alexander with state rep Vernon Jones planning the attack the day before.
[01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:03.215]  And people go, hey, that's a video from November 18th.
[01:04:05.933 --> 01:04:09.118]  And they don't respond and keep posting it because they don't care.
[01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:10.480]  They like lying.
[01:04:12.202 --> 01:04:13.204]  They're evil, folks.
[01:04:13.264 --> 01:04:13.804]  They're evil.
[01:04:13.824 --> 01:04:14.485]  They just love it.
[01:04:14.505 --> 01:04:17.610]  Because they're playing God.
[01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.112]  Here's Bruce Castor.
[01:04:19.132 --> 01:04:20.554]  Let's play clip three.
[01:04:21.636 --> 01:04:25.097]  Trump's so-called lawyer, who it turns out has sued Trump before.
[01:04:25.717 --> 01:04:26.738]  Oh yeah, Trump didn't know that.
[01:04:26.758 --> 01:04:27.658]  This is the people that give him.
[01:04:28.178 --> 01:04:35.400]  And this other guy called, he called him, another one of the lawyers called Trump a crook just three months ago and said he's a horrible person.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.301]  And that's his lawyer!
[01:04:36.321 --> 01:04:37.361]  That's who Trump gets!
[01:04:38.381 --> 01:04:39.502]  You can say, well Trump's an idiot.
[01:04:39.522 --> 01:04:40.842]  He doesn't even know how to use Google.
[01:04:41.222 --> 01:04:43.683]  But my God, you better start, but see it's all...
[01:04:44.588 --> 01:04:45.488]  It's all the sudden law.
[01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:47.970]  Man, Trump is under the spell of that Kushner.
[01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:51.071]  Let's go out to break with Bruce Castor.
[01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:56.594]  The American people just spoke and they changed administrations, agreeing that the election was legitimate.
[01:04:58.675 --> 01:05:10.241]  The reason that I am having trouble with the argument is the American people just spoke and they just changed administrations.
[01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:17.969]  So in the light most favorable to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle here, their system works.
[01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:27.913]  The people are smart enough, in the light most favorable to them, they're smart enough to pick a new administration if they don't like the old one.
[01:05:28.253 --> 01:05:29.134]  And they just did.
[01:05:29.494 --> 01:05:35.957]  And he's down there at Pennsylvania Avenue now, probably wondering, how come none of my stuff is happening up at the Capitol?
[01:05:37.472 --> 01:05:41.257]  Wow, that's the type of scum that's destroyed this country.
[01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:42.399]  And it gets worse when we come back.
[01:05:43.921 --> 01:05:47.225]  But just understand, that's who these people are.
[01:05:47.646 --> 01:05:52.032]  Yeah, Trump's third impeachment lawyer, Michael Vanderveer, called him an effing crook.
[01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:57.237]  And sued him last year, arguing the President was trying to suppress mail-in voting.
[01:05:57.457 --> 01:06:00.278]  These are all Democrat globalist operatives, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:01.078 --> 01:06:03.099]  And they're uncloaking there, right there.
[01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:09.581]  All right, we have a special guest joining us next hour, who is one of the leading folks online promoting Bitcoin.
[01:06:09.601 --> 01:06:10.802]  He's very well spoken.
[01:06:10.822 --> 01:06:14.763]  He has a good breakdown of the history of banking and World Reserve currencies and what he thinks is coming up.
[01:06:15.343 --> 01:06:17.444]  So we'll tell you who that individual is when they join us next hour.
[01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:23.986]  I need to cover all the rest of the news I haven't hit yet, but I wanted to finish up with this so-called trial.
[01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:37.091]  This is about listing all of us as insurrectionists and enemy combatants under the first Patriot Act, and a new Patriot Act that says the Attorney General can take guns or imprison anybody they want.
[01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:45.875]  Chuckie Schumer's introduced this through Swallow's Well in the Senate, in the House, but Schumer wrote it on record.
[01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:47.716]  The Chinese spy.
[01:06:47.856 --> 01:06:53.920]  I mean literally a Chinese spy on the Intelligence Committee and writing legislation about arresting and rounding up Americans.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.301]  You can't make this up.
[01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:57.682]  So it's all about saying we're insurrectionists.
[01:06:57.702 --> 01:06:59.884]  There's a very important article up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:01.525 --> 01:07:02.606]  De-Trumpification.
[01:07:03.026 --> 01:07:07.769]  Media lays out plan to deprogram Trump supporters from their extremist views.
[01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:13.593]  Now if you're wondering where this came from, it came out of Germany.
[01:07:14.693 --> 01:07:17.255]  And a lot of the operations the left runs against the U.S.
[01:07:17.315 --> 01:07:25.781]  are run out of Germany because during the Marshall Plan in 1945 and on, this was a place the U.S.
[01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:33.047]  put under Marshall Law, along with the Russians, for decades, and were really able to social engineer at a level never before seen.
[01:07:34.306 --> 01:07:39.670]  And they trained the CIA and others over there to be able to kill whoever they wanted, torture whoever they wanted.
[01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:50.760]  And so, really, the occupation of Germany is where America lost a lot more of its soul, and where a lot of these evildoers that we now have in control are actually trained by the people that did a lot of the stuff in the Germanys.
[01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:56.470]  Both East and West during that until the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989.
[01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:09.020]  But then Russia's influence supposedly subsided, but all of the globalist Stasi programming went into the Western Germany and then became the heart of the European Union that was then launched.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:15.505]  And then they brought in former Soviet leaders from all over the Eastern Bloc, famous ones to actually run the European Union.
[01:08:16.741 --> 01:08:22.503]  So when you hear Nigel Farage call it Soviet Union 2.0, Soviet Union Europe, it's exactly what it is.
[01:08:22.543 --> 01:08:24.084]  So it's just, that's where this comes from.
[01:08:24.264 --> 01:08:24.704]  I'll show you.
[01:08:26.164 --> 01:08:27.065]  Detrumpification.
[01:08:27.125 --> 01:08:34.267]  Media lays out plan to deprogram Trump supporters from their extremist views.
[01:08:34.488 --> 01:08:35.208]  Isn't that nice?
[01:08:36.048 --> 01:08:43.691]  The leftist propaganda outlet Axios on Tuesday laid out a program, and it's in German,
[01:08:45.424 --> 01:08:48.806]  For how to deprogram Trump supporters from their extremist views.
[01:08:48.826 --> 01:08:52.269]  You'll notice this is exactly what John Brennan and all the rest of them have said.
[01:08:52.949 --> 01:09:11.523]  The Dradalization program, which reads more like a radicalization program, called for mass censorship and a Soviet-style purge of all institutions to root out conspiracy theorists and their dangerous ideologies.
[01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:15.891]  And again, on Twitter and Facebook, you're allowed to post the Axios article.
[01:09:16.212 --> 01:09:18.332]  If you post an article being critical, that's banned.
[01:09:19.153 --> 01:09:20.654]  I mean, this is just lot-step evil.
[01:09:22.094 --> 01:09:24.715]  How to deprogram America's extremists by Kyle Daley.
[01:09:26.156 --> 01:09:29.017]  It will take an all-out... Now listen to how authoritarian this is.
[01:09:29.197 --> 01:09:29.918]  This is not 1984.
[01:09:30.358 --> 01:09:31.538]  This is not the Nuremberg trials.
[01:09:31.578 --> 01:09:32.739]  This is America.
[01:09:32.759 --> 01:09:32.739]  2021.
[01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:41.603]  It will take an all-out national effort to dismantle the radicalization pipeline.
[01:09:42.551 --> 01:09:43.172]  I wonder who that is.
[01:09:44.773 --> 01:09:54.262]  That has planted conspiracy theories in the heads of millions of Americans that you stage stuff and come for our guns and try to put us in camps, like I've been saying probably a million times, probably.
[01:09:54.682 --> 01:09:56.183]  I mean, listen, probably 500,000 times.
[01:09:57.424 --> 01:10:06.673]  Oh, Alex Jones says they're going to put us in camps, re-educate us, and come for our guns, and now they're like, damn right we're coming for your guns, going to put you in a re-education camp, give us a probable drone strike to your ass, or use nuclear weapons.
[01:10:07.193 --> 01:10:08.274]  They've said everything I just said.
[01:10:08.574 --> 01:10:09.035]  It's all as well.
[01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:25.359]  It will take an all-out national effort to dismantle the radicalization pipeline that has planted conspiracy theories in the heads of millions of Americans and inspired last month's attack on the Capitol.
[01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:26.179]  Inspired it!
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.263]  Very small minority being provocateured and now it's the end of the country because one cop had a heart attack.
[01:10:33.344 --> 01:10:35.546]  Two key measures that could make a difference.
[01:10:36.226 --> 01:10:39.689]  Keeping extremists out of the infrastructure where
[01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:42.446]  They could do the greatest damage.
[01:10:43.007 --> 01:10:49.953]  Oh, first, under Nazi Germany, there were certain places that groups that were in trouble with the state couldn't have jobs.
[01:10:50.994 --> 01:10:54.276]  The military, police, departments, and legislatures.
[01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.799]  Yeah, can't let voters vote these people in.
[01:10:58.015 --> 01:10:59.336]  Like the Congresswoman from Georgia.
[01:10:59.896 --> 01:11:00.136]  They got 75%.
[01:11:01.316 --> 01:11:05.238]  Yes, we have to stop the pipeline of people getting elected.
[01:11:05.618 --> 01:11:07.999]  We have to disrupt that with the CIA, they go on.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.401]  Providing help for those who have embraced dangerous ideologies.
[01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:15.463]  That means having people on TV saying, oh, you went through this.
[01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:16.543]  Oh, it was so hard for you.
[01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:24.867]  And then most of them, we later learn, are Southern Poverty Law Center operatives that claim they're part of groups, claim they infiltrate groups when they're not even infiltrating, and then they lie about them.
[01:11:25.207 --> 01:11:26.688]  We've personally experienced that.
[01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:30.310]  And yes, we figured out that those people had actually been working for him for a while.
[01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:35.013]  Online platforms, meanwhile, must be unwavering.
[01:11:35.313 --> 01:11:36.153]  Was this a Hitler speech?
[01:11:36.934 --> 01:11:40.536]  Unwavering in their commitment to root out conspiracy theorists.
[01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:41.636]  Do not question, that's right.
[01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:45.639]  And lies that undermine the faith in democracy.
[01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:46.139]  Yes, got it.
[01:11:46.619 --> 01:11:48.100]  Not let people have speech for democracy.
[01:11:49.461 --> 01:11:51.902]  According to experts interviewed by Axios.
[01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:53.423]  Oh, it's the experts.
[01:11:53.623 --> 01:11:54.344]  Oh, that it's okay.
[01:11:55.674 --> 01:11:58.676]  When they should defend torture, they go, well, these are professionals, I mean, they're experts.
[01:11:59.116 --> 01:12:10.082]  Radicalization and counter-terrorism experts broadly applauded tech companies' efforts now underway to remove this material and the accounts that spread it off their platforms.
[01:12:10.402 --> 01:12:15.565]  So first we were told nobody's being censored when we were, now the anti-terrorism expert says we gotta root them out.
[01:12:17.346 --> 01:12:21.148]  They said, but they've done a good job rooting it out despite heavy backlash from conservatives.
[01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:22.408]  Oh, heavy backlash?
[01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:25.070]  Republicans have hearings, they go, is there censorship?
[01:12:26.886 --> 01:12:32.512]  Gee, why did God make the sky so high so bluebirds wouldn't bump their heads?
[01:12:33.112 --> 01:12:42.461]  Twitter decision to ban Donald Trump is seen on its own as a major assist in the fight to slow or reverse radicalization.
[01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:42.982]  Yes.
[01:12:43.702 --> 01:12:44.023]  Yes.
[01:12:46.485 --> 01:12:47.406]  This is what's going on here.
[01:12:47.426 --> 01:12:48.007]  This is official.
[01:12:48.905 --> 01:12:49.425]  The U.S.
[01:12:49.485 --> 01:13:01.391]  needs a Marshall Plan against domestic extremism, said Daniel Kohler, director of the German Institute of Radicalization and Deradicalization Studies.
[01:13:01.851 --> 01:13:02.431]  Ah, yes.
[01:13:03.272 --> 01:13:10.315]  The spread of extremist conspiracy theories in the United States is the second most dangerous pandemic the country faces right now, he said.
[01:13:10.775 --> 01:13:12.716]  The damage that has been in the U.S.
[01:13:12.816 --> 01:13:17.759]  in terms of community and social cohesion will be immense and will be lasting.
[01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:20.480]  Oh, this is a disease, you see.
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.243]  We need to... Who else called political enemies a disease?
[01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:28.866]  I've been called by Brian Stelter and others a disease, a virus.
[01:13:30.127 --> 01:13:31.548]  Alex Jones is a virus.
[01:13:32.228 --> 01:13:32.628]  Virus.
[01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:37.472]  The damage is nothing that Goliaths cannot fix.
[01:13:38.922 --> 01:13:41.843]  And then, of course, Bernie Sanders says the same thing.
[01:13:42.163 --> 01:13:44.723]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:13:44.763 --> 01:13:57.466]  They go on to talk about where it's all happening and what they've got to do and how they've got to purchase out of schools and out of businesses and out of jobs and out of churches and just out of the streets.
[01:13:58.767 --> 01:13:59.787]  My wife was playing tennis.
[01:14:00.845 --> 01:14:02.066]  With these women she's known a few years.
[01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.568]  And one who walks in with a real ugly look on her face.
[01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:05.749]  And my wife goes, what's wrong?
[01:14:05.769 --> 01:14:11.374]  She goes, I just, you know, what's wrong is what you did at the Capitol trying to overthrow our country.
[01:14:11.394 --> 01:14:13.896]  My wife's like, we were protesting the election.
[01:14:14.076 --> 01:14:14.797]  That was a handful of people.
[01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:15.598]  She goes, oh yeah, right.
[01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:16.698]  Sure.
[01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:21.462]  They did this whole act of like, you know, oh gosh, what you did.
[01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:25.326]  You know, oh, oh, oh, it's like the Democrats were just saying.
[01:14:27.324 --> 01:14:33.685]  Jamie Raskin says Trump supporters burned down the church, too, that BLM did publicly.
[01:14:33.705 --> 01:14:37.326]  They're gonna deprogram us.
[01:14:37.446 --> 01:14:38.286]  Aren't we lucky?
[01:14:38.506 --> 01:14:41.367]  I mean, they're just using a total handbook of oppression.
[01:14:41.847 --> 01:14:45.068]  And they say people that believe there's shadowy groups controlling things.
[01:14:45.088 --> 01:14:49.489]  They're like, we must organize and shut people down who think there's organized groups shutting them down.
[01:14:50.811 --> 01:14:51.232]  Look at this one.
[01:14:51.472 --> 01:14:54.298]  The secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election.
[01:14:54.478 --> 01:15:00.329]  And they say that a shadowy group of banks and foreign groups and academics and others came together and stole the election.
[01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:02.854]  And I mean, it's all right here.
[01:15:03.945 --> 01:15:05.987]  Kamala Harris is just cackling and laughing.
[01:15:06.287 --> 01:15:07.468]  They stole the election.
[01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:09.849]  Now they want to sew it up with a dictatorship.
[01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:11.511]  America's going Venezuela style.
[01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:16.434]  They're cutting off our energy supplies, tripling the price of prescription drugs to rip you off.
[01:15:16.714 --> 01:15:17.915]  And the left's like, rape us!
[01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:18.476]  Rape us!
[01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:18.996]  Rape us!
[01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:19.516]  Rape us!
[01:15:19.817 --> 01:15:21.078]  Well, this just popped out.
[01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:26.722]  Elon Musk just went on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[01:15:28.285 --> 01:15:34.830]  Down the street from us here, and it just went out minutes ago, episode 1609, Elon Musk.
[01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:43.536]  We'll be talking with a very informative guest coming up in about 15 minutes into the next hour, known as BitBoy.
[01:15:44.445 --> 01:15:57.175]  And I look forward to having Ben Armstrong on because he's really knowledgeable about the history of banking and global currencies and the different maneuvers happening to talk about this ascension of Bitcoin now that Elon Musk endorsed it and now these big banks are endorsing it.
[01:15:57.255 --> 01:15:58.536]  I mean, it's in.
[01:15:59.797 --> 01:16:00.838]  I figured that a long time ago.
[01:16:00.858 --> 01:16:03.219]  I didn't want to steer anybody wrong and it's going to go up and down.
[01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:08.283]  It's very speculative, but they're definitely positioning it to be part of the new world reserve currency.
[01:16:08.824 --> 01:16:11.346]  And then, you know, China has theirs coming out, thinks they're going to be the first,
[01:16:12.662 --> 01:16:19.854]  The Insiders released Bitcoin 12 years ago or whatever, and I have no doubt, it's sophistication from the beginning, all of it, it's whole history.
[01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.779]  It was promoted by an army of stockbrokers.
[01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:30.790]  That it is definitely from the halls of the Dark Lord, as they say.
[01:16:31.431 --> 01:16:33.752]  Not mad at people that are into Bitcoin, making money off of it.
[01:16:33.832 --> 01:16:38.895]  It's just that, just like Q, that's from which it comes.
[01:16:39.755 --> 01:16:40.376]  That's my view.
[01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.477]  We'll talk about a lot of this with our guest coming up.
[01:16:45.658 --> 01:16:51.902]  But first, let's talk cold, hard facts.
[01:16:55.663 --> 01:17:10.875]  Without even intending to cover this, I came in here today and there was just a stack of insane evil news concerning Disney and child abuse, child sexual abuse.
[01:17:12.036 --> 01:17:13.778]  And what's crazy about it is,
[01:17:15.751 --> 01:17:21.435]  Disney's virtue signaling, kicking this former MMA lady out because she looks like a big tough man.
[01:17:21.715 --> 01:17:25.077]  That's the image they want as women, as you know, all the leaders and men are idiots.
[01:17:25.317 --> 01:17:28.259]  Goes back to Married with Children and all those shows where dad's always a moron.
[01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:33.922]  I mean, that's come out of memos, not just Gamergate, that they want to show an emasculated society.
[01:17:34.423 --> 01:17:37.284]  But even that wasn't enough for her, playing the part of the big male hero.
[01:17:40.346 --> 01:17:44.269]  Cancel Disney Plus trends after Star Wars cancels, Gina.
[01:17:45.273 --> 01:17:45.734]  Carano.
[01:17:47.398 --> 01:17:51.868]  And I'm not saying she's a bad actress and I'm not saying I dislike women that are strong and have that...
[01:17:53.115 --> 01:17:53.975]  Amazon type look.
[01:17:53.995 --> 01:18:04.220]  I think it's very attractive, but the point is is that she actually groveled and said that was so horrible what happened to the Jews, which it was bad what Hitler did, and they called it anti-semitic.
[01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:05.141]  Wow.
[01:18:05.581 --> 01:18:10.303]  She said Hitler could only do it because the public got involved with the state being oppressive.
[01:18:10.863 --> 01:18:13.385]  Well, you don't want to make parallels to COVID, do you?
[01:18:13.845 --> 01:18:18.107]  So she is kicked off the stupid Star Wars, which is probably a good career move.
[01:18:19.531 --> 01:18:23.613]  I mean, who would want to be in the worst movies ever made?
[01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:28.134]  I mean, these are just atrocious films.
[01:18:30.175 --> 01:18:31.196]  Absolutely atrocious.
[01:18:32.096 --> 01:18:38.038]  So, again, I mean, I don't think she looks that bad in person.
[01:18:38.058 --> 01:18:39.199]  I mean, I like a woman that's in good shape.
[01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:40.199]  She looks like a dude there.
[01:18:40.219 --> 01:18:40.840]  It's not attractive.
[01:18:42.711 --> 01:18:47.133]  That's what all of the guys in Hollywood, the pedophiles, fetishize that.
[01:18:47.834 --> 01:18:50.535]  They want men to always look like little boys and women to look like men.
[01:18:51.376 --> 01:18:53.457]  That's just all part of them playing God and doing whatever they want.
[01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:57.559]  So I'm going to start the next hour with a breakdown of this stack here.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.401]  Parental discretion is advised.
[01:19:00.421 --> 01:19:01.601]  This is mainstream news, too.
[01:19:02.562 --> 01:19:03.382]  This is mainstream news.
[01:19:04.763 --> 01:19:06.124]  And so that's who these people are.
[01:19:07.304 --> 01:19:10.246]  Oh, but she's fired because she literally
[01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:13.822]  Said that the Nazis were bad.
[01:19:14.162 --> 01:19:24.507]  And it's not like my film Endgame got banned off of Amazon because the movie Endgame came out, you know, ten years after mine came out, and they didn't like the fact that mine was getting so much traction because it had a similar name.
[01:19:24.767 --> 01:19:26.848]  So they said, oh, it's got Nazis in it.
[01:19:27.368 --> 01:19:29.009]  Uh, yeah, it was anti-Nazi.
[01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:32.390]  Showing the eugenics movement of the Nazis.
[01:19:34.811 --> 01:19:35.252]  Wow.
[01:19:36.852 --> 01:19:40.334]  But there are Nazis in the movie, so I guess you gotta ban Indiana Jones, too.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.622]  Because Where's the Lost Ark's got Nazis in it.
[01:19:45.062 --> 01:19:46.383]  So that is coming up.
[01:19:47.625 --> 01:19:49.766]  And it all ties together.
[01:19:54.951 --> 01:19:55.592]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:55.732 --> 01:20:00.736]  Two Mandalorian actors make Nazi Holocaust analogies months apart.
[01:20:00.776 --> 01:20:02.878]  Lucasfilm fires the conservative one.
[01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.019]  And that's the real reason.
[01:20:04.039 --> 01:20:05.320]  They just do it as a stunt.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.862]  Like, oh look, we're good.
[01:20:07.622 --> 01:20:09.224]  We fired a woman because
[01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:13.951]  She talked about the Nazis and how the public helped them, and that was wrong.
[01:20:15.651 --> 01:20:15.831]  Wow.
[01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:16.832]  Wait till you read her quote.
[01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.753]  But that's a small issue.
[01:20:19.593 --> 01:20:25.276]  It gets into all of the... it's just... I mean, when they show me this article,
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.241]  One of the crew members goes, hey, you gotta make the parallel out.
[01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:29.522]  Disney's got all those pedophile problems.
[01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:31.784]  And then I said, yeah, just go type it in.
[01:20:31.824 --> 01:20:33.365]  And like hundreds of articles come up.
[01:20:33.385 --> 01:20:35.547]  It's like convicted pedophiles raping kids.
[01:20:35.567 --> 01:20:36.427]  They know they're raping them.
[01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:37.448]  They let them rape them.
[01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.589]  They love pedophiles at Disney.
[01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:40.590]  It's all in the movies.
[01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:41.891]  It's all implanted in there.
[01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:45.614]  But then the first thing they can do, because they own Star Wars, is fire this woman over.
[01:20:45.634 --> 01:20:47.195]  It's just these people are sick.
[01:20:47.735 --> 01:20:48.616]  It is a sick joke.
[01:20:48.996 --> 01:20:50.657]  Oh, they're telling you there's no election fraud.
[01:20:50.677 --> 01:20:51.818]  You know, all the evidence is coming out.
[01:20:52.178 --> 01:20:53.659]  More criminal investigations.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:21:02.842]  of Georgia Senator Warnock for voter registration misconduct with, you guessed it, you know who the players are, they're in that state.
[01:21:03.582 --> 01:21:07.924]  Stacey Abrams, who's never conceded for like three years, but that was okay.
[01:21:08.384 --> 01:21:12.605]  Just when we don't concede, we're terrorists and need to be hit by the CIA.
[01:21:14.365 --> 01:21:16.186]  This is not going to end well, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:16.366 --> 01:21:23.528]  And I just say, don't be violent, even though I know you're outraged and you know what they're doing is wrong, because they've got it all set and phrased
[01:21:24.605 --> 01:21:25.865]  To then really start a civil war.
[01:21:26.385 --> 01:21:27.706]  The left's going to be taken out of power.
[01:21:29.046 --> 01:21:31.387]  Six months, a year, it's designed to sink.
[01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:35.668]  But in that destruction, they want to bring in a civil war and the end of the dollar.
[01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:37.868]  You can say, well, the dollar's corrupt and screw it.
[01:21:40.169 --> 01:21:46.030]  But it's going to hurt everybody and it's going to bring in global tumult and it's going to bring in a huge meltdown.
[01:21:47.271 --> 01:21:47.951]  It's extremely
[01:21:49.631 --> 01:21:50.552]  Extremely dangerous.
[01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:54.254]  There's another article up on Infowars.com from the Von Mise Institute.
[01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:54.795]  It's excellent.
[01:21:55.175 --> 01:21:57.897]  Troop deployments in Washington are a disaster waiting to happen.
[01:21:58.257 --> 01:22:02.520]  And there's a quote from John Taylor 200 years ago.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:13.067]  Tyranny in form is the first step towards tyranny in substance, warned Senator John Taylor 200 years ago in his forgotten classic, Tyranny Unmasked.
[01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:23.551]  Well, when you see tens of thousands of troops, or checkpoints, or domestic systems, or travel passes, and old people dying, being given the vaccine, you're not supposed to talk about it?
[01:22:23.811 --> 01:22:25.271]  That's not tyranny in form.
[01:22:25.551 --> 01:22:26.291]  We already had that.
[01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:29.812]  Now we have tyranny in substance, in action.
[01:22:31.232 --> 01:22:32.612]  The real deal.
[01:22:36.173 --> 01:22:38.813]  The real McCoy, as they say.
[01:22:40.193 --> 01:22:43.334]  And the military, on average, is awake, but they're still following orders.
[01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:48.366]  And the robots are going into place, so we're in a real crisis here.
[01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.979]  This country is fighting for its life.
[01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.000]  All right, I've got so much other news I want to hit.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.881]  Texas Sheriff confirms Biden releasing thousands of illegals into the U.S.
[01:22:56.901 --> 01:22:58.262]  without COVID test.
[01:22:58.822 --> 01:23:02.884]  And CPB operating massive migrant processing facility in Texas.
[01:23:03.224 --> 01:23:06.425]  Fed's setting up 45-acre city to handle migrant surge.
[01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:08.706]  We're going to process them and release them.
[01:23:08.746 --> 01:23:12.248]  But you are going to have domestic checkpoints inside the U.S.
[01:23:12.648 --> 01:23:17.350]  Biden has told the Miami Herald they are preparing federal troops for state checkpoints.
[01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:21.071]  They're going to pick certain states to put under siege, like Florida.
[01:23:21.471 --> 01:23:22.491]  Florida's open.
[01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:24.831]  They have low COVID numbers, even though it's a hoax.
[01:23:25.852 --> 01:23:26.932]  And it can't be allowed.
[01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:31.393]  So he's preparing a blockade of the state of Florida.
[01:23:31.413 --> 01:23:34.053]  I'm going to write back to how the Civil War started before.
[01:23:34.953 --> 01:23:36.314]  Just not Virginia this time.
[01:23:37.494 --> 01:23:38.214]  Or North Carolina.
[01:23:38.954 --> 01:23:40.075]  So that's just some of the news there.
[01:23:41.595 --> 01:23:42.055]  Separately,
[01:23:43.663 --> 01:23:59.214]  We have the super high-quality, gravity-fed water filtration system, Alexa Pure's best unit, their largest best unit, stainless steel, highest rated filtering, back in stock.
[01:23:59.274 --> 01:24:00.775]  No one told me it was sold out for six months.
[01:24:00.795 --> 01:24:03.097]  I've just been saying, get our high-quality water filtration.
[01:24:04.798 --> 01:24:08.141]  I'm not mad, but crew, when something's sold out and you happen to see it, just let me know.
[01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:12.364]  But the good news is it's back in stock, Alexa Pure Pro water filtration.

[01:24:16.424 --> 01:24:18.084]  And again, it's the highest rated you're going to find.

[01:24:31.367 --> 01:24:33.868]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:40.129]  That's InfoWarsStore.com to get the Alexa Pure
[01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:44.416]  Water filtration system, their biggest, best system.

[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.663]  Separately, we also have a bunch of products that are back in stock.
[01:24:53.843 --> 01:24:57.946]  One of them is Winter Sun to boost your immune system and overall body's defenses.
[01:24:58.486 --> 01:25:09.654]  Again, super high quality, highest grade vitamin D3 that we can get, along with vitamin K, which are both essential for your immunity, for your children, for old people especially.
[01:25:11.015 --> 01:25:14.777]  You know, your mom's in the nursing home, or your dad's old, or your aunt's old.
[01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:20.459]  They all need to be taking this, because anything can wipe you out if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:25:20.499 --> 01:25:22.600]  Winter Sun, available at infowarrestore.com.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:25.061]  And if you've already got it yourself, give it as a gift to your neighbor.
[01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:27.062]  Give it a gift to your boss or your employees.
[01:25:27.402 --> 01:25:31.664]  And then give a gift of the First Amendment continuing on here on air, because without you, we're going to get shut down.
[01:25:32.064 --> 01:25:34.605]  And we have the ultimate liquid turmeric formula.
[01:25:35.592 --> 01:25:38.753]  Extract concentrate back in stock, but not for long.
[01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:40.393]  The powdered one is sold out.
[01:25:40.673 --> 01:25:42.174]  That's all at Infowarshore.com.
[01:25:42.214 --> 01:25:43.294]  It's 50% off.
[01:25:51.596 --> 01:25:53.696]  Well, we're definitely over the mountain now, boys and girls.
[01:25:58.878 --> 01:25:59.938]  One of the intrepid crew
[01:26:02.315 --> 01:26:05.416]  He just pointed out what Fauci had said.
[01:26:08.757 --> 01:26:22.340]  By the time we get to April, that will be what I would call open season, Dr. Fauci says, about the timeline for vaccination ability for all groups to begin getting shots.
[01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:24.761]  Open season.
[01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:28.442]  Guys, please pull up the definition of Merriam-Webster's dictionary.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.441]  Of open season.
[01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:32.382]  And then we'll pull up Black's Law.
[01:26:32.803 --> 01:26:34.444]  It means you can kill.
[01:26:34.684 --> 01:26:35.205]  You can hunt it.
[01:26:36.238 --> 01:26:46.563]  And here it is, Biden's looking, and Governor DeSantis has responded, on locking states down with federal troops, having travel restrictions, internal martial law, the borders are wide open.
[01:26:46.963 --> 01:26:52.086]  Incredible article, seniors who already beat COVID-19 are dying from taking vaccine.
[01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:56.368]  Massive numbers dying within minutes or hours of taking it.
[01:26:56.528 --> 01:26:59.309]  Massive amounts being reported by the federal government dying from the vaccine.
[01:26:59.649 --> 01:27:01.130]  This is open euthanasia.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.541]  This is open season.
[01:27:04.461 --> 01:27:09.463]  A period when it's legal to kill or catch game or fish protected at other times by law.
[01:27:11.304 --> 01:27:12.425]  I'm sorry, this is so sick.
[01:27:12.685 --> 01:27:15.927]  Here's Governor DeSantis responding to
[01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.336]  Marshall Law and all the rest of it from Biden.
[01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:24.278]  I told you he was going to only tighten the noose as soon as he got in, not release it.
[01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:25.539]  See all you leftists?
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.361]  You're not part of the establishment.
[01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:29.462]  It's open season on your dumb ass.
[01:27:29.782 --> 01:27:30.122]  Here it is.
[01:27:48.035 --> 01:28:02.211]  Restricting the right of Americans to travel freely throughout our country while allowing illegal aliens to pour across the southern border unmolested would be a ridiculous but very damaging farce.
[01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:04.072]  So we will oppose it 100%.
[01:28:05.774 --> 01:28:07.555]  It would not be based in science.
[01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:12.179]  It would purely be a political attack against the people of Florida.
[01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:15.441]  And it's unclear why they would even try talking about that.
[01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:19.324]  Just look at the COVID situation in the state of Florida.
[01:28:19.344 --> 01:28:21.346]  So since December, the last couple months,
[01:28:21.906 --> 01:28:27.567]  Florida's per cases per capita compared to the rest of the country, 28.
[01:28:28.007 --> 01:28:30.268]  27 other states higher per capita cases.
[01:28:30.608 --> 01:28:34.129]  And for the entire pandemic, it's a similar story.
[01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:41.391]  Hospitalizations per capita over this time period, Florida ranks 30th.
[01:28:41.411 --> 01:28:45.091]  29 other states have higher per capita hospitalizations.
[01:28:45.532 --> 01:28:50.233]  Fatalities per capita for this same period, Florida ranks 42nd.
[01:28:52.173 --> 01:28:54.135]  41 states have higher protection.
[01:28:54.155 --> 01:28:54.755]  Let's stop there.
[01:28:55.075 --> 01:28:55.956]  I like DeSantis.
[01:28:55.976 --> 01:28:58.058]  I have a good feeling about him.
[01:28:58.178 --> 01:28:59.479]  I think he's a good guy.
[01:28:59.499 --> 01:29:00.199]  He's backed Trump.
[01:29:00.259 --> 01:29:01.140]  He's done a lot of great things.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.562]  But just like Trump, we put him back on screen, please.
[01:29:04.122 --> 01:29:06.063]  Just like Trump, he goes, oh, it's science.
[01:29:06.103 --> 01:29:07.684]  It's like all the vaccines I got in the Navy.
[01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:08.965]  He's a Navy SEAL.
[01:29:09.045 --> 01:29:13.449]  Oh, it's... No, it's an mRNA gene therapy and not a good one.
[01:29:13.469 --> 01:29:15.090]  It's going to give gene therapy a bad name.
[01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:16.371]  There's a lot of promising gene therapy.
[01:29:16.671 --> 01:29:19.273]  It goes in and creates a protein
[01:29:21.118 --> 01:29:23.143]  That the body then has an autoimmune response to.
[01:29:24.773 --> 01:29:30.335]  And when cells die, most of them build up that protein, and you're gonna have constant, serious anaphylactic shock.
[01:29:30.555 --> 01:29:32.256]  It's in the frickin' literature, man!
[01:29:32.676 --> 01:29:33.957]  And it's killin' a bunch of people.
[01:29:33.997 --> 01:29:43.041]  And the tops, the former chief scientist at Merck, who left in good standing, has been writing papers warning people, saying, I'm an expert in this, this thing is designed to hurt people.
[01:29:43.341 --> 01:29:46.602]  Other scientists say it's a road to hell, he'd rather die than take it.
[01:29:47.222 --> 01:29:48.043]  Biggest hoax ever.
[01:29:48.463 --> 01:29:48.943]  So there it is.
[01:29:49.503 --> 01:29:51.964]  The scientist has a sign, if you're a radio listener, why am I going off on it?
[01:29:51.984 --> 01:29:53.185]  It says, seniors first.
[01:29:53.965 --> 01:29:58.189]  And then you text this number, and if you're old, you get it first.
[01:29:58.529 --> 01:30:09.439]  Hey, DeSantis, the British ministry two months ago had so many old people died, they said no one over 75 should have the Pfizer or the other mRNA vaccines.
[01:30:09.459 --> 01:30:10.280]  There's four of them.
[01:30:11.381 --> 01:30:14.003]  It's one thing if somebody wants to attenuate the virus and take that.
[01:30:14.504 --> 01:30:18.968]  But those, quote, are effective because you can't create a vaccine for a damn cold virus.
[01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:19.888]  Everyone knows it.
[01:30:21.522 --> 01:30:23.964]  DeSantis is very responsive to his constituents, folks.
[01:30:24.104 --> 01:30:25.125]  Flood him with the articles.
[01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:28.988]  Flood him with the three groups that shouldn't take the mRNA vaccine from the British News.
[01:30:29.568 --> 01:30:31.069]  Same damn vaccine.
[01:30:31.569 --> 01:30:35.532]  And it says not over 75, not under 16, and not when you're pregnant.
[01:30:35.773 --> 01:30:37.574]  A lot of people are dying!
[01:30:37.734 --> 01:30:38.114]  Dammit!
[01:30:38.695 --> 01:30:39.415]  Do something!
[01:30:40.076 --> 01:30:41.417]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:43.274 --> 01:30:51.859]  Hashtag Cancel Disney Plus is trending after Star Wars cancels Gina Carano, who is a conservative former MMA fighter.
[01:30:52.659 --> 01:30:55.561]  She fit the bill as the big burly girl that beats all the boys.
[01:30:55.601 --> 01:31:04.346]  That's a prerequisite in all action movies put out by Hollywood to undermine the idea of male supremacy and male toxic masculinity.
[01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:12.151]  But when she put out a tweet talking about how horrible the Nazis were, but that it was the public that helped the Nazis do it,
[01:31:13.305 --> 01:31:17.251]  They banned her as a virtue signal.
[01:31:20.216 --> 01:31:21.257]  You're like, but it doesn't make sense.
[01:31:21.298 --> 01:31:22.319]  She said the Nazis were bad.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.785]  It's about anybody can be banned anytime for any reason.
[01:31:26.726 --> 01:31:27.507]  It's total control.
[01:31:27.527 --> 01:31:28.349]  It's authoritarianism.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:40.645]  The now deleted Instagram story showed a picture of a Jewish woman being persecuted by Nazis and said Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers, but by their neighbors, even by children.
[01:31:40.905 --> 01:31:53.932]  Because history is edited, most people don't today know and realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their neighbors hate them simply for being Jews.
[01:31:54.732 --> 01:31:57.894]  How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?
[01:31:59.042 --> 01:32:05.807]  So because she pointed out that what Hitler did to certain groups, the left is doing to us, well yeah, Hitler learned it from the communists.
[01:32:06.468 --> 01:32:11.471]  Mussolini learned what he did from the communists, and Hitler learned from Benito Mussolini and the black shirts.
[01:32:13.953 --> 01:32:19.938]  Benito Mussolini was the leader of the communists until he converted to fascism.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:22.960]  But see,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.081]  Hollywood is now the real fascism.
[01:32:27.321 --> 01:32:31.763]  So she points out all this tyranny and says this so she's kicked off the show.
[01:32:33.424 --> 01:32:40.568]  But somebody else on the same movie comparing Trump to Nazis and the Holocaust, well that's okay, because see, that's not true.
[01:32:40.848 --> 01:32:44.890]  So let's talk about Disney and how this authoritarian system
[01:32:46.158 --> 01:32:49.999]  And how heavily invested Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and all of them are in it.
[01:32:50.019 --> 01:32:56.562]  And how they're all helping with legacy media, big Hollywood productions, and big tech to create this unified oppression.
[01:32:56.802 --> 01:33:00.463]  But what they're really into and what their culture is and what makes them tick.
[01:33:01.184 --> 01:33:05.225]  Now this is a small micron of the pedophilia in Disney.
[01:33:05.545 --> 01:33:06.466]  Overhead shot please.
[01:33:06.486 --> 01:33:11.327]  This is just search engine Disney, manager pedophilia, Disney director pedophilia.
[01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:13.348]  You'll get hundreds of articles.
[01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:14.749]  Overhead shot please.
[01:33:14.769 --> 01:33:15.329]  There's a few of these.
[01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:21.074]  Disney manager was living vicariously through child porn images, deputies say.
[01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:26.439]  Disney hired convicted child molester to work on 2006 kids show report.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.603]  Director of Disney film about troubled teen is registered sex offender, AP.
[01:33:33.745 --> 01:33:39.970]  Some questions, ABC and Disney's willingness to work with registered sex offenders and pedophiles after immediately canceling Roseanne.
[01:33:41.011 --> 01:33:44.094]  We're talking bad about George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[01:33:45.114 --> 01:33:48.859]  Police Uncover Massive Pedophile Ring at Disney World!
[01:33:50.401 --> 01:33:51.782]  I mean, look at these dudes.
[01:33:52.243 --> 01:33:53.204]  That's your PBP.
[01:33:53.725 --> 01:33:54.646]  Potbelly Pedophile.
[01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:55.988]  They all got that same look.
[01:33:56.508 --> 01:33:57.510]  But that's a Renfield.
[01:33:57.550 --> 01:34:00.453]  They always serve the archetypal Dracula types.
[01:34:00.473 --> 01:34:01.334]  That's like Chuckie Schumer.
[01:34:02.956 --> 01:34:03.918]  I'm not saying he's a literal...
[01:34:05.427 --> 01:34:06.588]  Count Dracula, folks, I'm saying.
[01:34:06.668 --> 01:34:10.071]  I mean, Prince Charles is literally the line of Count Dracula and does all the satanic rituals.
[01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:10.772]  That's actually true.
[01:34:11.192 --> 01:34:11.733]  You think I'm joking?
[01:34:11.753 --> 01:34:13.814]  He's typing Prince Charles, direct line of Count Dracula.
[01:34:14.095 --> 01:34:22.942]  He now lives in, he bought Count Dracula Castle back and has little kids that stay there with him and there's all these weird photos in Romania and Transylvania of him with little kids in the castle, like little boys.
[01:34:22.962 --> 01:34:24.924]  I mean, you can't, can't make this up, folks.
[01:34:25.204 --> 01:34:25.905]  You think I'm joking?
[01:34:26.265 --> 01:34:29.368]  Typing Prince Charles with orphans in Transylvania.
[01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:31.170]  I'm not joking about any of this.
[01:34:32.503 --> 01:34:35.564]  Disney World employs 16 men arrested in child pornography sting.
[01:34:35.984 --> 01:34:39.485]  Disney under fire for hiring convicted pedophiles to work in kids shows, specifically.
[01:34:39.805 --> 01:34:46.307]  Disney fires Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn after tweets about rape pedophilia unearthed.
[01:34:46.607 --> 01:34:53.909]  No, he hosted parties, child molesters parties, child molester themed parties, where they simulated killing children.
[01:34:55.947 --> 01:35:00.828]  Former Disney Channel actor alleges manager sexually assaulted him, almost weekly.

[01:35:13.731 --> 01:35:19.012]  Meanwhile, Biden's not going to confront the CCP about all their slaves and slave camps, but that's okay because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:35:19.473 --> 01:35:23.073]  Cops arrest 16 suspected pedophiles, blah blah blah, on and on and on.
[01:35:23.533 --> 01:35:25.274]  On and on and on, on and on and on, on and on and on.
[01:35:26.365 --> 01:35:29.868]  Now 35 Disney World workers arrested on sex charges.
[01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:34.091]  Mandolin star, though, she's fired.
[01:35:35.292 --> 01:35:36.353]  She said the Nazis were bad.
[01:35:37.114 --> 01:35:42.659]  Bella Thorne opened up about her childhood sexual abuse and why she never went to the police.
[01:35:43.319 --> 01:35:49.084]  Jeffrey Epstein, financer, has forced his victims into sham marriages for U.S.
[01:35:49.124 --> 01:35:49.504]  visas.
[01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:51.686]  It's all a global trafficking ring.
[01:35:51.766 --> 01:35:52.687]  It's human smuggling.
[01:35:55.603 --> 01:35:59.744]  Unearthed tweet show, Jamie Raskin, Joe Biden saying, fight like hell.
[01:36:00.104 --> 01:36:03.305]  Oh, fight like hell, but now he wants to impeach Trump for it.
[01:36:05.566 --> 01:36:15.748]  How a leading anti-Trump group ignored a crisis in its own ranks, the head of the Lincoln Project, a big fat popopito.
[01:36:17.289 --> 01:36:21.650]  New York's Catholic church leaders control billions outside the reach of abuse survivors.
[01:36:22.938 --> 01:36:25.740]  Super Bowl runs ads making jokes about Hillary and pedophilia.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.941]  It's so much fun.
[01:36:29.282 --> 01:36:30.723]  And then what I covered last week.
[01:36:30.803 --> 01:36:35.366]  German nuns rented orphaned boys to businessmen for gang bangs and orgies.
[01:36:38.628 --> 01:36:39.209]  And it goes on.
[01:36:39.269 --> 01:36:40.089]  It's all mainstream news.
[01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:44.372]  And then how Obama smuggled kids in that ended up in sex slavery.
[01:36:44.992 --> 01:36:47.314]  But it's okay, because he's black.
[01:36:50.572 --> 01:36:51.672]  What happened to the kids in cages?
[01:36:51.732 --> 01:36:52.753]  Well, they disappeared.
[01:36:53.093 --> 01:36:54.313]  And it was on Obama's watch.
[01:36:55.654 --> 01:37:06.177]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in Pedophile Ring, where the state knowingly placed small boys with convicted rapists in a psychological test that spanned over 40 years.
[01:37:06.477 --> 01:37:10.538]  The psychiatrist said the one true love is a man having sex with a boy.
[01:37:10.778 --> 01:37:14.479]  We're creating a new civilization based on man-boy love.
[01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:19.541]  Yep.
[01:37:21.272 --> 01:37:30.942]  Senior Republican that was anti-Trump, arrested for running pedophile ring, was organizing the rape of babies, promised screaming babies in pain, their favorite.
[01:37:31.142 --> 01:37:31.683]  I'm quoting them.
[01:37:32.324 --> 01:37:36.969]  And then Obama administration placed children with human traffickers, report says, Washington Post.
[01:37:39.022 --> 01:37:45.124]  But remember, folks, this is just, remember, they said there's no pedophilia and none of it exists.
[01:37:45.804 --> 01:37:50.105]  And if you talk about it, you're making it up, and it's all pizzagated, it's fake, and you should be banned.
[01:37:50.366 --> 01:37:58.988]  And if you try to share these articles on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook, they ban you because they're protecting the whole damn thing.
[01:38:00.049 --> 01:38:03.390]  I'll say this for Obama, he only places kids with molesters.
[01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:07.051]  He actually, in the files, likes
[01:38:08.075 --> 01:38:08.315]  Men.
[01:38:08.956 --> 01:38:11.057]  And that's consenting men, you know, whatever.
[01:38:11.357 --> 01:38:13.338]  He does hire them.
[01:38:13.678 --> 01:38:18.901]  $65,000 in male prostitutes at one party in Chicago alone for Obama over the weekend.
[01:38:20.287 --> 01:38:23.249]  Going right, they say, is probably dozens of men.
[01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:24.510]  So there you go.
[01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:29.654]  And I mean, look, the fact that he's married to Big Mike, it's okay that she's a trans.
[01:38:29.734 --> 01:38:33.277]  I don't hate people for the fact that, you know, that's going on.
[01:38:33.337 --> 01:38:38.460]  Just the issue is, is that Joan Rivers said she's trans, and a lot of people think that's the word.
[01:38:38.501 --> 01:38:39.721]  She's got the shoulders of a linebacker.
[01:38:39.761 --> 01:38:40.062]  He does.
[01:38:40.922 --> 01:38:41.663]  Then she was dead.
[01:38:42.323 --> 01:38:43.424]  They said she went in for a routine
[01:38:44.855 --> 01:38:48.398]  Surgery, and they said when she died, fire was shooting out of her mouth two feet.
[01:38:48.678 --> 01:38:49.139]  I'm not kidding.
[01:38:49.419 --> 01:38:53.222]  Some of the device machine blew up in her throat while she was getting plastic surgery.
[01:38:54.243 --> 01:38:54.683]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:38:54.743 --> 01:38:59.387]  Obama was a cocaine-using gay hustler, says woman who claims to have been a Hawaiian classmate.
[01:39:00.748 --> 01:39:01.068]  All right.
[01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.412]  But that's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:39:05.432 --> 01:39:08.754]  It's like, hey, if he runs, if Apple runs death camps, it's okay.
[01:39:09.395 --> 01:39:10.616]  Because again, Tim Cook's gay.
[01:39:11.056 --> 01:39:11.577]  Just remember that.
[01:39:12.682 --> 01:39:18.485]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, our guest is BitBoy on YouTube, BitBoy Crypto, Ben Armstrong.
[01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:27.509]  And I've seen his videos for a while, but I've seen some really good historian on things, really has his ear to the ground, knows the grindstone, smart cookie.
[01:39:28.029 --> 01:39:31.951]  And so now that you see the total ascension of Bitcoin and all the rest of this, I thought we should have him on.
[01:39:32.471 --> 01:39:36.493]  I'm trying to get him on for a week or so, but actually it's perfect timing today that he's here with us.
[01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:39.334]  We'll be right back with BitBoy, BitBoy Crypto.
[01:39:39.354 --> 01:39:39.775]  Stay with us.
[01:39:40.635 --> 01:39:41.136]  Welcome back.
[01:39:41.196 --> 01:39:42.278]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:47.566]  We have Ben Armstrong of BitBoy Crypto.
[01:39:47.646 --> 01:39:49.269]  Very, very popular joining us.
[01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:54.817]  He's on Twitter at BitBoy underscore crypto and on Facebook BitBoy Crypto.
[01:39:55.868 --> 01:39:57.749]  And we had Max Keiser on last week.
[01:39:57.789 --> 01:40:00.830]  He predicted all-time highs for Bitcoin.
[01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:04.331]  He first told me about it more than 10 years ago, tried to give me a bunch of it.
[01:40:04.551 --> 01:40:13.655]  I was at Bilderberg event covering it, and quite frankly had eaten so much roast at night, was drinking wine with him and David Icke, that I didn't ever actually get the Bitcoin.
[01:40:13.675 --> 01:40:17.056]  He was actually pissed off about it for a while, wouldn't talk to me for about six months.
[01:40:17.816 --> 01:40:19.877]  But I wish I would have gotten on that train.
[01:40:20.297 --> 01:40:20.997]  But here's the news.
[01:40:21.117 --> 01:40:24.779]  America's oldest bank adopts cryptocurrencies, will treat Bitcoin as
[01:40:25.996 --> 01:40:26.937]  Any other asset?
[01:40:27.818 --> 01:40:32.424]  MasterCard's announcing that they're going to take it and a bunch of cryptocurrencies it looks like.
[01:40:32.784 --> 01:40:35.487]  Elon Musk was just down the street from me at Joe Rogan's studio.
[01:40:35.527 --> 01:40:38.871]  That interview happened today but just dropped about an hour after they taped it.
[01:40:39.632 --> 01:40:40.253]  That's gone out.
[01:40:40.333 --> 01:40:42.716]  A bunch of big stuff was reportedly said there.
[01:40:43.156 --> 01:40:45.899]  And so regardless what you think about Bitcoin, it's become dominant.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:46.320]  It's there.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:47.640]  What about the other currencies?
[01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:48.521]  What does this mean?
[01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:49.481]  What's it mean to the dollar?
[01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.902]  What's it mean to the new Chinese currency?
[01:40:51.162 --> 01:41:02.426]  The reason I wanted to get BitBoy Crypto on, Ben Armstrong, is I've seen his stuff for a long time, but some of his videos lately, he really does a great job, better than I do, laying out the history of this, what's going on, what he thinks is gonna happen.
[01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:05.847]  And so I really appreciate him joining us for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:41:05.867 --> 01:41:07.268]  Good to have you here, BitBoy.
[01:41:08.499 --> 01:41:08.799]  Thank you.
[01:41:08.819 --> 01:41:09.439]  Appreciate it.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.142]  Definitely glad to be here and talk Bitcoin and crypto and the whole nine yards.
[01:41:14.622 --> 01:41:18.384]  Well, where do you want to start with what's currently happening or where it began?
[01:41:18.404 --> 01:41:19.604]  Because you've got so much to say.
[01:41:19.624 --> 01:41:20.825]  Yeah.
[01:41:21.405 --> 01:41:29.929]  Well, I think the interesting thing that I was thinking about while you were doing the introduction there was, you know, for me personally, I go back also to 2012.
[01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:35.212]  So about nine years ago is the first time I invested in Bitcoin and I wasn't really investing in it.
[01:41:35.952 --> 01:41:43.914]  As an investable asset, I was putting money into it to use it for the original purpose of Bitcoin, which was supposed to be an electronic currency.
[01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:48.716]  And so, I also, kind of like you at that time, didn't realize what I was looking at.
[01:41:48.896 --> 01:41:50.136]  And I actually did have some.
[01:41:50.656 --> 01:41:55.718]  What happened was, is over the next several years, after I sold and made a few thousand dollars early on,
[01:41:56.425 --> 01:41:56.865]  I think so.
[01:42:15.613 --> 01:42:25.001]  Don't fall into the same trap that I fell into, which was not really knowing about it, kind of hearing about it, but not necessarily knowing what it was in the revolution that is Bitcoin.
[01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:29.485]  And so, you know, I have a similar story to that, is you not knowing what I was looking at at the time.
[01:42:29.545 --> 01:42:36.210]  And it's very interesting to see where it's came to, and now, on the channel here, we're the number one cryptocurrency channel right now.
[01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:38.452]  We just took that crown away this week.
[01:42:38.972 --> 01:42:54.504]  And so, we know there are people watching, there are people interested, and, you know, I know for you personally, and for InfoWars and things like that, deplatforming is a big conversation, and, you know, there's whole branches of blockchain and cryptocurrency that deal with that as well, so just a lot of interesting stuff to look at.
[01:42:55.262 --> 01:43:04.347]  Elon Musk a few months ago sent out, they call it a lewd image, it really was, it was a beautiful woman bent over and her rear end has Bitcoin over it and he said, you know, me being tempted by Bitcoin.
[01:43:04.647 --> 01:43:11.771]  Well, it looks like the temptation was just too much for him and it looks like him coming into the market just a few days ago has set off a chain reaction.
[01:43:12.051 --> 01:43:13.252]  How does he have so much influence?
[01:43:14.693 --> 01:43:28.540]  Yeah, it is interesting, and I think this is where we get into the difference between something like Dogecoin that he tweets about and the price goes up, and then you see what he's really doing with Bitcoin, where Tesla put in $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin through an SEC filing last month.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.462]  You really start to see where he's putting his money, where his mouth is.
[01:43:32.102 --> 01:43:37.565]  And I just think when it comes to Bitcoin, the future and truth of it is undeniable at this point.
[01:43:37.585 --> 01:43:39.766]  There's no longer a conversation of if it's going to make it.
[01:43:40.185 --> 01:43:42.506]  The conversation is, how high is it going to go?
[01:43:42.906 --> 01:43:45.146]  What is the future of Bitcoin going to look like?
[01:43:45.186 --> 01:43:53.949]  Is it going to eventually become a reserve, a world reserve currency, kind of almost like in the same vein of gold, you know, the way it backed US dollars at one time?
[01:43:54.449 --> 01:43:59.411]  Or is it going to become more like a currency itself, where people are exchanging it as a medium?
[01:43:59.431 --> 01:44:02.872]  And I think, you know, at this point, most of us believe that's not the case.
[01:44:02.912 --> 01:44:03.472]  We do believe
[01:44:03.852 --> 01:44:05.794]  That it is much more of digital gold.
[01:44:05.834 --> 01:44:09.797]  Now, how high that can go in terms of world adoption, we don't know.
[01:44:10.217 --> 01:44:11.038]  That's the question.
[01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.299]  It's not whether it's going to make it or not.
[01:44:12.339 --> 01:44:13.740]  It's not whether it's a good investment.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:20.685]  In the long term, it's how popular is this going to be across the world and can it, you know, change financial markets forever?
[01:44:20.805 --> 01:44:23.147]  And of course, we definitely believe here at BitBoy Crypto that it can.
[01:44:25.094 --> 01:44:33.377]  Well, I like your show because I don't feel like I'm being hustled, and I have a lot of knowledge just about financial markets and the history of banking, and then I know what Bitcoin is.
[01:44:33.397 --> 01:44:33.997]  I understand it.
[01:44:34.037 --> 01:44:37.579]  I've stayed out of it just because I don't want to steer my listeners wrong.
[01:44:37.599 --> 01:44:43.461]  I mean, I told them, I don't know, what was it, six, seven years ago, I said, gold's about to go down for a while, maybe five, six, seven, eight years.
[01:44:43.921 --> 01:44:46.722]  I'd get out now, and I had a bunch of sponsors get pissed, and I said, I'm sorry.
[01:44:47.102 --> 01:44:47.924]  I'm going to do what I think.
[01:44:48.024 --> 01:44:51.229]  Now I told people a couple years ago, I said, get back into gold, back into silver, you've seen what happens.
[01:44:51.490 --> 01:44:56.919]  This is pretty common sense stuff, so gut level, what made you finally get into it, and where do you see it going now?
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:59.885]  I think the sky's the limit now that big banks are endorsing it.
[01:45:00.982 --> 01:45:01.802]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:01.842 --> 01:45:13.408]  I mean, the stuff we're seeing today with MasterCard and with BNY Mellon and then also with Amazon also testing digital currency payment solution in Mexico.
[01:45:13.448 --> 01:45:14.528]  That news came out today as well.
[01:45:14.849 --> 01:45:19.871]  And then just, you know, Tesla buying Bitcoin, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have it.
[01:45:20.754 --> 01:45:22.175]  Here's something so interesting.
[01:45:22.235 --> 01:45:28.758]  We're seeing these companies use Bitcoin not only to kind of back their treasuries now, it's publicity.
[01:45:29.178 --> 01:45:34.760]  If you're a company and you're buying Bitcoin, it's so favorable right now that you get a lot of attention.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.022]  Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy was a company that basically nobody knew about.
[01:45:38.502 --> 01:45:44.387]  Until they bought $450 million worth of Bitcoin, and now they're the hottest thing going, especially in Bitcoin and crypto conversations.
[01:45:44.767 --> 01:45:51.452]  He's actually the guy that spoke with Elon Musk and kind of lured him over into finally committing to Bitcoin.
[01:45:52.072 --> 01:45:56.976]  So for me, what it took to get there was just understanding that the system that we have now is broken.
[01:45:56.996 --> 01:45:57.957]  I think we all know that.
[01:45:58.777 --> 01:46:01.680]  I mean, the Wall Street Bets thing has definitely proven that to us.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.301]  But in terms of
[01:46:04.443 --> 01:46:10.269]  Bitcoin versus kind of gold, and you were talking about, I really like what you said there, where you said, you didn't feel like you're being hustled on my channel.
[01:46:10.289 --> 01:46:10.990]  We're very authentic.
[01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.871]  We're very transparent.
[01:46:11.971 --> 01:46:14.294]  And we're going to tell the people exactly what's going on.
[01:46:14.314 --> 01:46:19.960]  We're not going to, you know, give these crazy stories and narratives based on whatever is popular that day.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.744]  We're very consistent with what we believe is happening with cryptocurrency.
[01:46:24.324 --> 01:46:25.705]  It's based on a four-year cycle.
[01:46:25.925 --> 01:46:28.007]  We're now in the fourth cycle of Bitcoin.
[01:46:28.568 --> 01:46:33.652]  And we know that pretty much for the rest of this year, for the majority of the year, prices are going to go up.
[01:46:34.092 --> 01:46:37.775]  And then we know at some point towards the end of the year, we're probably going to go through another bear market.
[01:46:37.795 --> 01:46:38.836]  We'll start another bear market.
[01:46:38.856 --> 01:46:40.577]  And we're not afraid to say that.
[01:46:41.078 --> 01:46:41.979]  A lot of people would say that.
[01:46:41.999 --> 01:46:43.300]  But look at the long-term graph.
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:43.960]  It's going up.
[01:46:45.141 --> 01:46:45.662]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:45.982 --> 01:46:46.122]  Yeah.
[01:46:46.402 --> 01:46:48.364]  Well, for most of Bitcoin's life,
[01:46:49.356 --> 01:46:51.719]  Every single person who's ever invested in it is in profit.
[01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:53.581]  And that tells you everything you need to know.
[01:46:53.601 --> 01:46:57.304]  Right now, as of today, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high at $48,540 or $580, somewhere around there.
[01:46:57.384 --> 01:47:00.047]  Literally, this morning, every single person who had ever invested in Bitcoin was in profit and made money.
[01:47:09.207 --> 01:47:11.869]  Now, you know, the thing is, is did they sell?
[01:47:11.929 --> 01:47:15.192]  You know, a lot of times along the way, people will sell, they'll get scared.
[01:47:15.332 --> 01:47:19.875]  You know, the kids these days are calling it, you got to have the diamond hands from Wall Street bets.
[01:47:20.295 --> 01:47:24.999]  But you got to have the gumption to be able to stick with your gut and stay in the market
[01:47:25.854 --> 01:47:28.516]  When the prices are down because you know eventually they're going to go up.
[01:47:28.656 --> 01:47:31.598]  You're overhauling all of these markets, the whole stock market, everything.
[01:47:31.698 --> 01:47:37.803]  Obviously it's all inflationary and it's designed to screw people over that want to jump in at the top and think they're going to get out real quick.
[01:47:37.823 --> 01:47:38.584]  That's not how it works.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:39.940]  Absolutely not.
[01:47:40.421 --> 01:47:42.622]  No, I mean, and that's what the big money is counting on.
[01:47:42.962 --> 01:47:51.268]  And, you know, kind of the stuff of Wall Street bets make me wonder a little bit if maybe a lot of investors are baited into getting in the stock market right now as it could be near the top.
[01:47:51.488 --> 01:47:52.829]  Well, yeah, China runs Reddit.
[01:47:52.849 --> 01:47:54.710]  I think that whole thing smelled big time.
[01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:55.351]  Stay right there.
[01:47:55.391 --> 01:48:04.077]  Let's come back and just look at every angle of this and what this means and why this isn't the tulip mania that was a total bubble hoax.
[01:48:04.097 --> 01:48:05.198]  There is real value of Bitcoin.
[01:48:05.718 --> 01:48:07.699]  What is its main value and who's behind it?
[01:48:07.819 --> 01:48:08.220]  We'll be right back.
[01:48:09.212 --> 01:48:12.994]  Well, the world is a changing, and it's changing fast.
[01:48:13.274 --> 01:48:15.115]  We've got BitBoy Crypto on with us.
[01:48:16.175 --> 01:48:19.697]  Ben Armstrong at BitBoy Crypto on Facebook.
[01:48:20.217 --> 01:48:22.678]  And of course, he's the number one crypto show on YouTube now.
[01:48:23.258 --> 01:48:24.339]  Very well spoken, smart guy.
[01:48:24.359 --> 01:48:25.580]  I got a bunch of questions.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:30.042]  I want to talk about some of the other currencies, how people are making their own cryptocurrencies.
[01:48:30.062 --> 01:48:35.704]  I mean, I like the idea of having other currencies that aren't just tied to governments and systems.
[01:48:36.264 --> 01:48:36.885]  And when I say
[01:48:38.021 --> 01:48:39.022]  Everything's inflationary.
[01:48:39.602 --> 01:48:45.827]  When the main currencies are inflationary, that's going to be seen in the stock market.
[01:48:45.847 --> 01:48:48.468]  So I understand there's a limited amount of Bitcoin.
[01:48:48.829 --> 01:48:53.832]  It itself is inflationary, but other inflationary systems are going to drive it up as people hedge bets.
[01:48:54.353 --> 01:48:55.133]  That's happened with gold.
[01:48:55.193 --> 01:48:55.854]  It's happened with silver.
[01:48:55.894 --> 01:48:56.814]  It's happened with Bitcoin.
[01:48:57.675 --> 01:49:06.161]  And again, I've understood this, but I've never wanted to actually endorse this or that because it's just, it's got a lot of danger in it.
[01:49:06.201 --> 01:49:06.941]  But I think now,
[01:49:08.177 --> 01:49:11.058]  It looks like the system is giving a nod to Bitcoin.
[01:49:11.819 --> 01:49:13.420]  From your research, who really started it?
[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:18.062]  And let's talk about some of its providence, because you're an informed guy, you talk to a lot of people.
[01:49:18.902 --> 01:49:24.065]  And did the system start it to grow its own new global currency?
[01:49:24.945 --> 01:49:28.006]  China thinks they're about to launch theirs, but here this is 10, 12 years ahead of it.
[01:49:28.807 --> 01:49:33.049]  Or is the system now just watching it grow and get so big they just want to absorb it?
[01:49:33.989 --> 01:49:35.010]  What's the best money on?
[01:49:36.792 --> 01:49:42.275]  Yeah, so it's a very interesting conversation when you really start to break down, you know, Bitcoin versus other currencies.
[01:49:42.435 --> 01:49:54.863]  And then, like you were mentioning about hedging assets, I mean, obviously part of the rise of Bitcoin over this last year has been the overwhelming money printing in the United States due to the stimulus.
[01:49:55.223 --> 01:49:58.365]  When you really think about since Bitcoin's creation, you know,
[01:49:59.445 --> 01:50:05.089]  Out of the 2008 financial crisis and 2009, you know, 70% of all U.S.
[01:50:05.169 --> 01:50:09.152]  dollars in existence have been printed since the creation of Bitcoin.
[01:50:09.665 --> 01:50:14.928]  And when you really start to break that down and wrap your mind around it, it is so insane.
[01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:21.212]  I mean, 25% to 30% of all dollars in the world, or of all US dollars, you know, in circulation total, were printed last year.
[01:50:21.672 --> 01:50:22.573]  It's horrifying!
[01:50:22.953 --> 01:50:23.414]  It's horrifying.
[01:50:23.434 --> 01:50:23.654]  It is.
[01:50:24.474 --> 01:50:24.915]  Absolutely.
[01:50:24.935 --> 01:50:38.303]  And so, part of the rise of Bitcoin has been compounded by that money printing because, obviously, as the dollar has dropped 12% for the DXY, the dollar index,
[01:50:38.903 --> 01:50:44.608]  I mean, obviously, that drop has added to the amount of dollars in value that Bitcoin increases.
[01:50:45.009 --> 01:50:51.074]  So it's really just one of these tricky things where, you know, I'm always kind of caught in the middle because, I mean, I'm, you know, I love my country.
[01:50:51.114 --> 01:50:52.635]  I love America for sure.
[01:50:52.735 --> 01:51:00.782]  And it's not the best thing for America for us to lose the world reserve currency, for us to have this crazy inflation, this crazy money printing.
[01:51:01.343 --> 01:51:04.426]  But at the same time, the left is doing everything they can.
[01:51:04.986 --> 01:51:09.271]  I mean, they just signed an executive order tripling prescription prices and ripping people off.
[01:51:10.012 --> 01:51:11.874]  They're the keystone pipeline.
[01:51:11.914 --> 01:51:19.023]  I mean, everything that would make you invest here, they're turning the life support off on the country so that America's going to have to do whatever they're going to do to survive.
[01:51:19.403 --> 01:51:21.546]  I don't mean to digress there, but it's sick.
[01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:36.211]  Well, kind of what I would say about that is that when you really look throughout the history of civilization in the world, when you look back at the Romans and you look back at the Greeks, and you see what happened with their system of money, they all had the same thing in common.
[01:51:36.611 --> 01:51:42.976]  Even though helicopters were not invented back then, they were basically dropping helicopter money at the end of their civilizations too.
[01:51:43.316 --> 01:51:48.359]  And we've really hit a point with the dollar to where it's almost irreversible.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.822]  We have gone so parabolic with the amount of money that we printed
[01:51:53.053 --> 01:51:54.354]  It's almost like there is no going back.
[01:51:54.394 --> 01:51:59.139]  And you mentioned the digital currency from China, the digital yuan.
[01:51:59.159 --> 01:52:02.983]  Well, they've already done testing on that last year in 2020.
[01:52:03.204 --> 01:52:05.786]  Now, the testing supposedly didn't go so great.
[01:52:06.107 --> 01:52:13.435]  Basically, the people of China said, well, why would we use this when we could just use WePay from the WeChat app?
[01:52:14.015 --> 01:52:17.637]  And there's a lot of questions about whether or not that's going to really take off there.
[01:52:17.757 --> 01:52:21.158]  And, you know, I know, obviously, China wants to have that world reserve currency.
[01:52:21.678 --> 01:52:36.424]  And so, you know, right now, with the dollar losing so much value, and then with China on the, you know, on the move trying to get the world reserve currency, because obviously, you know, if that happens, they would have the same economic power over the world that we have having the reserve currency.
[01:52:36.864 --> 01:52:38.745]  And for people that just don't understand how that works,
[01:52:39.395 --> 01:52:47.261]  Whatever country has the world reserve currency, every bank in every country around the world that wants to transfer money, they have to own your currency.
[01:52:47.581 --> 01:52:50.463]  That's what really gives us such, you know, financial power over the rest of the world.
[01:52:50.503 --> 01:52:57.008]  And we're the, you know, latest in a long line of reserve currencies that started in the 1400s in Portugal.
[01:52:57.569 --> 01:53:01.532]  And the average lifespan of each one of these currencies is 100 years.
[01:53:01.632 --> 01:53:05.495]  And right now, we are right at the 100-year mark for the U.S.
[01:53:05.515 --> 01:53:05.815]  dollar.
[01:53:06.463 --> 01:53:17.189]  So it's very interesting to see that kind of as we got to the end of this stimulus, this money print, well not to the end of the stimulus, but where we're at in the money printing, that it seems like all that's lining up and it's very scary.
[01:53:17.209 --> 01:53:17.969]  By the way, let's just slow down.
[01:53:18.009 --> 01:53:20.371]  A lot of people are going to say America's 250 years old.
[01:53:20.431 --> 01:53:23.152]  Explain to them there's been different phases in the U.S.
[01:53:23.172 --> 01:53:26.994]  currency and how it operated and how you're saying we're in 100 years of this current dollar.
[01:53:27.254 --> 01:53:29.896]  Those at Bretton Woods are about 70 years from that system.
[01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.497]  So we're coming to the end of Bretton Woods.
[01:53:32.677 --> 01:53:33.217]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:53:33.237 --> 01:53:34.437]  That's what Bull is down to.
[01:53:34.897 --> 01:53:45.199]  And so obviously we've had the dollar for longer than that, but we've been the world reserve currency at which the epicenter of financial dealings in the world for close to 100 years now at this point.
[01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:56.721]  So because of that, each one of these, if you go back, you look when Portugal had it, when you look when Spain had it, when you look when the UK had it, then you see the average lifespan is 100 years.
[01:53:56.801 --> 01:53:57.081]  That's right.
[01:53:57.101 --> 01:54:01.502]  When the pound went under after World War II, we inherited the British Empire.
[01:54:02.622 --> 01:54:04.664]  And so now we're right back in that cycle again.
[01:54:04.744 --> 01:54:08.247]  Why do you think the establishment is setting America up for a fall?
[01:54:08.307 --> 01:54:09.988]  I mean, Trump obviously tried to block that.
[01:54:10.288 --> 01:54:11.329]  That really pissed him off.
[01:54:11.369 --> 01:54:12.350]  That was his big crime.
[01:54:13.531 --> 01:54:15.272]  And people are like, well, he's battling vaccines.
[01:54:15.332 --> 01:54:17.794]  I go, yeah, I get Trump doesn't know what he's doing in some areas.
[01:54:17.814 --> 01:54:20.377]  But I said, you know, he is at least trying to prop up the dollar.
[01:54:20.557 --> 01:54:22.238]  And that got in the middle of their path.
[01:54:22.298 --> 01:54:22.859]  What do you think?
[01:54:23.558 --> 01:54:23.898]  We're good to go.
[01:54:46.618 --> 01:54:49.579]  Yeah, so that's definitely an interesting question.
[01:54:49.619 --> 01:54:51.980]  So, I look at that and I see three possible options.
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:02.183]  I don't think the dollar, I mean, if we just look at history, and I know people have been saying the dollar is going to collapse forever, and I was definitely guilty of laughing at those people five years ago.
[01:55:02.863 --> 01:55:05.864]  But now, as of today, understanding where we're at in the world,
[01:55:06.838 --> 01:55:08.359]  It's just not going to be much longer.
[01:55:08.379 --> 01:55:09.079]  No way around it.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:12.401]  So we're really looking at what I think are three possible players.
[01:55:13.022 --> 01:55:14.042]  We'll get the digital yuan.
[01:55:14.323 --> 01:55:17.505]  I mean, that's why China's testing it right now, obviously.
[01:55:17.585 --> 01:55:19.206]  Why would they be doing it at this exact moment?
[01:55:19.526 --> 01:55:24.088]  They see what's coming, you know, with the stimulus, the money printing, we can lose that reserve currency.
[01:55:24.789 --> 01:55:29.192]  So that's one thing that definitely could become the next, you know, reserve currency, the digital yuan.
[01:55:29.592 --> 01:55:33.114]  Number two would be Bitcoin, right?
[01:55:33.154 --> 01:55:34.515]  Well, Bitcoin might not necessarily be
[01:55:35.055 --> 01:55:42.778]  The reserve world currency in the way we've traditionally had it, it can be more the reserve currency as a backing to something else.
[01:55:42.838 --> 01:55:47.640]  And that could actually be maybe a stable coin that's pegged to the value of Bitcoin.
[01:55:48.161 --> 01:55:53.383]  Because, I mean, everybody on the peer-to-peer level is people, is humans.
[01:55:53.963 --> 01:56:00.990]  Most of us would be in favor of a peer-to-peer system that doesn't involve tons of regulation and tons of people jumping in the middle.
[01:56:01.391 --> 01:56:02.652]  And so that could kind of provide that.
[01:56:02.672 --> 01:56:05.074]  There's nobody that owns Bitcoin as a whole.
[01:56:05.615 --> 01:56:14.143]  Even the creator, which a lot of us think is, you know, is past or, you know, maybe not, has maybe lost access to his, you know, storehouse of Bitcoin.
[01:56:15.024 --> 01:56:16.125]  But a lot of us think,
[01:56:17.234 --> 01:56:19.176]  Well, nobody owns Bitcoin to the point is what I'm trying to say.
[01:56:19.256 --> 01:56:20.857]  Nobody owns Bitcoin as a whole.
[01:56:21.177 --> 01:56:22.538]  Okay, so that's the second scenario.
[01:56:22.578 --> 01:56:23.319]  What's your other scenario?
[01:56:23.839 --> 01:56:30.084]  The third scenario would be, this is pretty dark, it's a pretty dark scenario, Facebook.
[01:56:30.144 --> 01:56:31.145]  Facebook with Libra.
[01:56:31.645 --> 01:56:43.815]  Now, if you look at what Facebook tried to do by creating their own coin, I mean, we all know that, you know, Facebook and big tech, the techocracy, as I call it on my channel, it's a very dark future looking at what's going to happen if those companies control things.
[01:56:44.335 --> 01:56:46.996]  And they're already operating governmentally.
[01:56:47.036 --> 01:56:48.416]  They're already setting up their own courts.
[01:56:48.857 --> 01:56:50.177]  They're already setting up their own cities.
[01:56:50.317 --> 01:56:52.478]  I mean, they are really behaving as if they are the future.
[01:56:53.598 --> 01:57:02.661]  Well, I would say that a lot of times we really direct all of our, you know, hatred on what's happening in the current system towards the government.
[01:57:03.181 --> 01:57:04.842]  And obviously the government has a role to play.
[01:57:04.862 --> 01:57:07.883]  Oh no, the government can't even find its ass with both hands compared to big tech.
[01:57:08.697 --> 01:57:10.598]  Yeah, the number one enemy right now is Big Tech.
[01:57:10.679 --> 01:57:12.160]  I mean, I agree with that 100%.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.661]  And so that's it.
[01:57:14.101 --> 01:57:17.263]  If Libra is able to—it's already launched in one form.
[01:57:17.624 --> 01:57:19.966]  Basically, the government said, you can't do it in that way.
[01:57:20.006 --> 01:57:25.590]  They basically, instead of having it pegged to a stable or a basket of assets, it's now pegged individually to each currency.
[01:57:26.230 --> 01:57:33.776]  And I don't know, if Big Tech continues on the way it is, then we could be looking at a Facebook stablecoin as the reserve currency.
[01:57:33.876 --> 01:57:35.898]  And then if you're not a good little globalist, you're not allowed to have it.
[01:57:36.258 --> 01:57:38.279]  We'll be right back with BitBoy Crypto.
[01:57:38.339 --> 01:57:39.380]  Smart guy, stay with us.
[01:57:39.921 --> 01:57:41.462]  I am not against innovation.
[01:57:41.902 --> 01:57:44.224]  I'm worried about Trojan horses in technology.
[01:57:45.165 --> 01:57:49.408]  But then if I'm suspicious of it, I never got into Bitcoin and I could raise hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:57:49.828 --> 01:57:51.930]  I'd listen to Max Keiser in front of this whole operation.
[01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:54.033]  You can run your own show on that.
[01:57:54.113 --> 01:57:55.514]  It's going to be the biggest thing within 10 years.
[01:57:55.534 --> 01:57:57.236]  Here, here's 10,000 of them, or whatever.
[01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.278]  And I'm like, okay, yeah, right.
[01:57:59.759 --> 01:58:00.740]  And then, you know, here we are.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.342]  But literally got so mad at me, he wouldn't talk to me for six months.
[01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:04.763]  Max is a great guy.
[01:58:05.424 --> 01:58:08.127]  But we're about to go back to our guest here in a minute, BitBoy Crypto.
[01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:10.689]  But first, back in stock after being sold out for six months.
[01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:12.951]  You're like, Jones, we hear you plug this all the time.
[01:58:12.971 --> 01:58:14.293]  No one told me this was sold out.
[01:58:14.973 --> 01:58:18.717]  The Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest, stainless steel, gravity-fed filter.
[01:58:18.997 --> 01:58:19.918]  Cuts all the garbage out.
[01:58:19.938 --> 01:58:21.199]  It's the highest rated one out there.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:23.341]  There are hundreds of these gravity-fed systems.
[01:58:24.382 --> 01:58:26.905]  And so there's like two or three that are right up there at the top with it.
[01:58:26.945 --> 01:58:27.646]  We sell two of them.
[01:58:28.166 --> 01:58:35.253]  But we've got a special $50 off on the Alexa Pure Pro and a bunch of other discounts at InfowarsStore.com.

[01:59:09.076 --> 01:59:13.499]  Okay, let's now go ahead and go back to BitBoy Crypto.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.681]  And again, you can find him on YouTube.
[01:59:15.701 --> 01:59:16.982]  Just type in BitBoy Crypto.
[01:59:17.462 --> 01:59:18.342]  Very, very easy to find.
[01:59:18.402 --> 01:59:20.244]  Number one show on YouTube.
[01:59:20.524 --> 01:59:23.946]  Tens of millions of views a week on what's happening, getting hotter and hotter.
[01:59:24.486 --> 01:59:26.267]  Of course, you have the great website.
[01:59:26.287 --> 01:59:28.469]  What's the best website for folks to visit BitBoy?
[01:59:29.591 --> 01:59:30.993]  Well, we do have BitBoyCrypto.com.
[01:59:31.034 --> 01:59:33.798]  We're actually in the process of rebranding that.
[01:59:33.838 --> 01:59:39.428]  We'll have a whole brand new look and feel to that website coming out in the next probably two to four weeks.
[01:59:41.465 --> 01:59:41.985]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:00:05.097 --> 02:00:06.178]  Spectrum of currencies.
[02:00:06.478 --> 02:00:10.180]  I think Bitcoin's going to be king, because whoever put it out thought a great system first.
[02:00:10.481 --> 02:00:14.703]  That's why I think it's probably the establishment, probably the globalists, but we can get your take on that.
[02:00:15.044 --> 02:00:19.747]  And so I see it being for a while a bunch of like stocks and like different systems.
[02:00:19.787 --> 02:00:23.829]  And then there'll be gateway portals to your card or to your phone or to your face scan.
[02:00:24.370 --> 02:00:31.555]  And then people will then be managing all these different currencies they've got that then extrapolates out with an algorithm and that is basically accepted everywhere.
[02:00:31.575 --> 02:00:31.995]  What do you think?
[02:00:33.462 --> 02:00:37.046]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of possibilities on where things are going.
[02:00:37.086 --> 02:00:40.129]  Some of them good, and definitely, you know, some of them could be bad.
[02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:51.641]  I mean, we all know with technology, as you know very well from stuff you talk about on this show, you know, there are definitely ways that they can be, you know, beneficial, and they can also be used for control and things like that.
[02:00:51.661 --> 02:00:53.703]  Oh yeah, I don't want Wall Street to take control of it.
[02:00:53.723 --> 02:00:54.905]  I just think that's what they're going to do.
[02:00:56.095 --> 02:01:04.165]  Yeah, well, we kind of see some of that happening right now with some of the big institutional banks coming in.
[02:01:04.666 --> 02:01:05.728]  Here's a great, for instance.
[02:01:06.008 --> 02:01:06.569]  There's a guy.
[02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:08.431]  His name is Scott Minard.
[02:01:08.852 --> 02:01:10.854]  He is from Guggenheim Partners.
[02:01:10.894 --> 02:01:12.757]  He is their CIO, Chief Investment Officer.
[02:01:13.497 --> 02:01:20.166]  This guy, within three weeks, went on CNBC and through some other outlets.
[02:01:20.867 --> 02:01:23.190]  One week, he says Bitcoin is going to $400,000.
[02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:28.556]  The next week, he says, oh, everyone show restraint.
[02:01:28.616 --> 02:01:29.658]  Bitcoin may be done.
[02:01:29.778 --> 02:01:31.139]  And then the next week, he says it's going to $600,000.
[02:01:32.561 --> 02:01:40.823]  The thing that happened in the middle there was Guggenheim Partners had filed, you know, something with the SEC, a deal where they were going to buy Bitcoin on a certain date.
[02:01:41.264 --> 02:01:48.206]  And guess what day he came out and said, show restraint, we don't know how it's going to be, literally the day before they were allowed to buy it.
[02:01:48.226 --> 02:01:53.867]  And that was the day, you know, the Bitcoin price... So he drove it down in total manipulation to buy it?
[02:01:54.848 --> 02:01:55.348]  Absolutely.
[02:01:55.388 --> 02:01:55.748]  We see that.
[02:01:55.768 --> 02:01:57.568]  We see JP Morgan doing it consistently.
[02:01:57.588 --> 02:01:59.709]  JP Morgan... That's what they do to silver!
[02:02:00.854 --> 02:02:02.735]  Yeah, there's a lot of similarities.
[02:02:03.056 --> 02:02:10.020]  But the thing is, is now, you know, in my opinion, I make this comparison a lot, you know, the internet is basically the printing press of our modern time.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:19.007]  And if you look back at what happened in the days with the church, back before the printing press, they would control because nobody could read the Bible and know what it actually said.
[02:02:19.047 --> 02:02:25.271]  So they're like, you know, you had to pay X, you know, number of dollars or whatever the equivalent was at the time for a blessing or to be forgiven or whatever.
[02:02:25.291 --> 02:02:26.592]  Indulgences, indulgences.
[02:02:28.453 --> 02:02:30.895]  Yes, and then the people got it and learned how to read it.
[02:02:30.915 --> 02:02:33.116]  They were like, uh, this doesn't fly.
[02:02:33.156 --> 02:02:33.936]  This doesn't line up.
[02:02:33.976 --> 02:02:44.002]  And so what we're seeing now with the internet and what we saw with Reddit and the Wall Street subreddit is we're realizing that David's got a lot more power than Goliath at this point.
[02:02:44.022 --> 02:02:46.304]  There's more of David than of Goliath.
[02:02:46.324 --> 02:02:49.686]  People get educated and they're not just listening to a priest.
[02:02:50.006 --> 02:02:52.167]  They're going to make bigger decisions as we join in groups.
[02:02:52.567 --> 02:02:54.388]  The system isn't going to be all powerful forever.
[02:02:54.408 --> 02:02:56.790]  There'll probably be a new system and we'll have new rulers.
[02:02:58.083 --> 02:03:00.265]  Yeah, I mean, we've seen that consistently through time.
[02:03:00.285 --> 02:03:03.867]  You know, you have some good seasons, and then you have bad seasons.
[02:03:03.907 --> 02:03:06.269]  You're giving the keys to the kingdom, and then you mess the whole thing up.
[02:03:06.329 --> 02:03:07.850]  I mean, we've seen that time and time again.
[02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:08.791]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:03:10.052 --> 02:03:12.214]  What cryptocurrency has the best value?
[02:03:12.234 --> 02:03:14.155]  Because people are always going to ask me, what's the value?
[02:03:14.175 --> 02:03:16.076]  And I'm like, well, what's the value of a tally stick?
[02:03:16.116 --> 02:03:17.557]  Gold and silver is industrial metal.
[02:03:17.938 --> 02:03:19.619]  We know why that, but that's a fiat.
[02:03:19.999 --> 02:03:22.781]  I mean, not fiat, that is a finite thing.
[02:03:23.382 --> 02:03:27.365]  I mean, is Bitcoin king of all these currencies, or what do you think is the best, and why does it have value?
[02:03:28.533 --> 02:03:37.759]  Yeah, well, I would say that Bitcoin is definitely the king in terms of right now, and it's going to be the best bet for most people to come into the market.
[02:03:37.839 --> 02:03:45.044]  I mean, we just know that not only does it have a lot of upside in a bull market, but it has less volatility to the downside.
[02:03:45.104 --> 02:03:46.445]  It's still a lot of volatility.
[02:03:46.465 --> 02:03:56.371]  If you look at the average bear market, which we've gone through three full bear markets now in cryptocurrency, Bitcoin drops an average of 85% while the other cryptocurrencies drop like, you know, 95%.
[02:03:59.433 --> 02:04:00.814]  Clearly, this stuff's here to stay.
[02:04:00.914 --> 02:04:03.195]  Clearly, Bitcoin looks like it'll be here probably forever.
[02:04:03.856 --> 02:04:05.257]  What are you most invested in?
[02:04:05.977 --> 02:04:06.918]  Yeah, Ethereum.
[02:04:06.958 --> 02:04:09.459]  Ethereum is the number one coin that we're invested in.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:11.861]  We also like a competitor of theirs, Cardano.
[02:04:11.881 --> 02:04:12.882]  We're real big on ADA.
[02:04:13.562 --> 02:04:24.009]  Because we think, and this is what it breaks down to, if Bitcoin were to completely replace the gold market cap, the last number I looked at, I don't know if this is accurate, like $11 trillion, somewhere around there for gold.
[02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:26.670]  That's the limit, right?
[02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:38.916]  When you look at Ethereum and Cardano and even Polkadot and Elrond is another one, Egold, these have the opportunity to bring the derivatives markets into play for regular people.
[02:04:38.976 --> 02:04:44.098]  And we do a lot of hate and shaming on the hedge funds for shorting.
[02:04:44.804 --> 02:04:51.306]  And there's this idea that we want to, like, break up this derivative system, which, by the way, is a quadrillion dollars of IOUs floating around the world.
[02:04:51.826 --> 02:04:54.027]  But in reality, I don't think that's the way we should be looking at it.
[02:04:54.067 --> 02:05:01.510]  We should be looking at it as, wow, this is an opportunity for the common man to play the same game that the big money is playing.
[02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:12.933]  And so, the derivatives market can come into cryptocurrency, well, not into cryptocurrency in general, the derivatives market can come into play through these smart contract platforms in a decentralized manner.
[02:05:13.374 --> 02:05:14.254]  And because of that,
[02:05:14.854 --> 02:05:26.121]  I think when you factor in the quadrillion dollars of IOUs in the derivatives market, that brings so much higher value on the long term to those smart contract platforms that are losing the game.
[02:05:26.141 --> 02:05:28.823]  And by the way, I agree, but once you're talking about quadrillions, it doesn't even matter.
[02:05:28.843 --> 02:05:31.004]  I mean, it's quadrillions and quadrillions.
[02:05:31.064 --> 02:05:35.767]  I mean, the numbers are just like, it doesn't even, there's not enough atoms in the universe at this point.
[02:05:36.653 --> 02:05:37.614]  Yeah, I think it's funny.
[02:05:37.634 --> 02:05:42.678]  I always make this comparison, but one of my favorite movies growing up, which I don't get into this kind of humor anymore, but was Dumb and Dumber.
[02:05:42.718 --> 02:05:44.679]  Like, I loved Dumb and Dumber as a kid.
[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:47.661]  We're looking for old oil boys.
[02:05:47.981 --> 02:05:49.723]  There's a town about two miles down that way.
[02:05:50.715 --> 02:05:51.355]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:05:51.696 --> 02:05:58.400]  But I like the part where the whole movie is about this million-dollar briefcase that gets, you know, in Jim Carrey's hands by accident.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:03.403]  And at the end of the movie, it's like the climax, or in the, you know, there's a gun out, and there's all kinds of stuff happening.
[02:06:04.003 --> 02:06:05.384]  And they say, open the briefcase!
[02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:08.026]  And he opens the briefcase, and all it is is IOUs.
[02:06:08.246 --> 02:06:09.046]  He spent all the money.
[02:06:09.407 --> 02:06:13.129]  And it's like, you got this IOU for a, I think it was a Lambo or a Ferrari or something in there.
[02:06:13.369 --> 02:06:15.170]  And I'm like, that's our entire financial system.
[02:06:15.190 --> 02:06:19.533]  That's like over 50% of all the world's money is in this derivatives market.
[02:06:19.973 --> 02:06:20.794]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:06:20.834 --> 02:06:21.254]  That's good.
[02:06:21.534 --> 02:06:30.119]  And that very same Klaus Schwab UN globalist group wants the Great Reset to put us in debt and convince us that everything falls apart because of this virus.
[02:06:30.179 --> 02:06:35.122]  No, it's the lockdown that's the cover for this world reset they want.
[02:06:35.142 --> 02:06:39.225]  And I mean, I think so far in your research, I'm sure you've come upon the whole Great Reset issue.
[02:06:40.117 --> 02:06:41.057]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:41.137 --> 02:06:43.939]  It's funny, that was something we definitely want to mention on this interview here.
[02:06:43.979 --> 02:06:51.922]  We did a whole series on The Great Reset, five videos on it back a few months ago, and that's where we discovered a lot of really interesting things.
[02:06:52.482 --> 02:06:54.423]  And I mean, it's not, like, it's not deniable.
[02:06:54.483 --> 02:07:00.606]  The IMF has said that's what they want to do, and they put out a blog post showing what the future will look like, and the future looks like.
[02:07:01.546 --> 02:07:02.147]  Hey, you know what?
[02:07:02.287 --> 02:07:03.787]  I love giving up my privacy.
[02:07:03.847 --> 02:07:05.908]  Like, that's the words they want to put into our mouths.
[02:07:05.948 --> 02:07:07.169]  They want us to accept
[02:07:07.709 --> 02:07:12.915]  Big Brother in the world for a better future for all of us based on the opinions of who?
[02:07:27.751 --> 02:07:29.372]  Folks, you need to check out his website.
[02:07:29.492 --> 02:07:31.273]  You need to check out the information.
[02:07:31.313 --> 02:07:34.454]  You need to check out their Facebook, BitBoy Crypto.
[02:07:34.494 --> 02:07:36.636]  BitBoy underscore crypto is BitBoy Crypto.
[02:07:36.696 --> 02:07:37.796]  That is Ben Armstrong.
[02:07:38.056 --> 02:07:39.497]  Hope he'll join us again soon.
[02:07:39.537 --> 02:07:44.419]  Back in two minutes, and we'll get his take on the Great Reset and how to fight back against it, because it's just crazy.
[02:07:44.459 --> 02:07:47.841]  Like, I have a private jet airplane, but you can't have a car, says John Kerry.
[02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:51.663]  I mean, these people are just the most hypocritical, condescending criminals.
[02:07:52.363 --> 02:07:53.064]  And man,
[02:07:53.484 --> 02:07:56.207]  I would love to see a bunch of decentralized things unseat them.
[02:07:56.587 --> 02:07:58.829]  My God, these parasites keep us poor on purpose.
[02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:00.711]  We have unlimited wealth, folks.
[02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:01.272]  We'll be right back.
[02:08:01.292 --> 02:08:01.692]  Stay with us.
[02:08:02.253 --> 02:08:06.336]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:08.058 --> 02:08:10.761]  Well, most of you probably might have heard of this guy.
[02:08:10.821 --> 02:08:13.744]  He's big on YouTube, big on Facebook, but I mean, he's just impressive.
[02:08:13.764 --> 02:08:14.564]  He knows what he's talking about.
[02:08:15.605 --> 02:08:19.068]  And of course we're talking about Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto.
[02:08:19.088 --> 02:08:20.470]  We have about five minutes left in this segment.
[02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:22.632]  Appreciate your time here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.312 --> 02:08:27.896]  Get more into the Great Reset and how you think we counter that, because there's so many ways to counter it.
[02:08:28.177 --> 02:08:31.760]  You were mentioning the Redditors fighting back, then they rigged that and drove it down.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.684]  Regulators fed start market manipulation probes into Reddit Raiders.
[02:08:36.084 --> 02:08:41.449]  So big giant firms can actually manipulate the market, but when little guys get together, it's bad.
[02:08:43.226 --> 02:08:54.961]  Yeah, well, I mean, actually, I mean, if you go back and look at the Robinhood stuff, I mean, that was actually all about Robinhood selling the data from the trades of their smaller investors to the big hedge funds so they knew how to short it right way.
[02:08:55.341 --> 02:08:58.685]  And, you know, that's just a mockery of a free market.
[02:08:58.705 --> 02:09:00.908]  That's literally targeting your users.
[02:09:01.348 --> 02:09:01.669]  Literally.
[02:09:02.009 --> 02:09:02.869]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:09:03.269 --> 02:09:05.250]  And we see that in a lot of different places.
[02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:07.791]  I mean, you can make the argument that that's what banks are doing.
[02:09:08.251 --> 02:09:13.572]  I mean, we have so many issues with banks here at BitBoy Crypto with our bank accounts trying to spend our own money.
[02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:23.455]  I had actually had my bank account shut down because I had a Coinbase transaction where I wired money into my account directly from Coinbase instead of going through PayPal first.
[02:09:23.495 --> 02:09:25.636]  Totally, I mean, just business money that we had from
[02:09:26.036 --> 02:09:28.877]  From dealings and things like that, and they shut my account down because of it.
[02:09:29.457 --> 02:09:30.737]  And these banks are really squirming.
[02:09:30.777 --> 02:09:37.019]  They're really starting to see that they're archaic, they've had no competition for so long, and there's something new, and it's called blockchain.
[02:09:37.439 --> 02:09:42.120]  And through blockchain decentralization, this is how we fight, you know, the Great Reset.
[02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:50.102]  This is the first time in history that we actually have the ability to have rules with no rulers and governance with no governors.
[02:09:50.738 --> 02:09:59.870]  All through code and the inner working smart contracts of blockchain, we can actually change the future of how we work together as people and as humanity.
[02:09:59.890 --> 02:10:03.795]  And I mean, it's a little, it's a little utopian to maybe dream that that could happen.
[02:10:04.336 --> 02:10:07.500]  But like I've said before, it may not happen, but it's our only shot right now.
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.000]  That's it.
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:09.681]  This is the only shot that we have.
[02:10:10.121 --> 02:10:13.101]  We see the powers of the IMF, you know, really trying to take control.
[02:10:13.461 --> 02:10:19.683]  This great reset stuff is just so scary that now they're just out there just blatantly telling you that they want to take away your privacy.
[02:10:19.783 --> 02:10:22.904]  And not only do they want to take your privacy, they want you to be okay.
[02:10:22.924 --> 02:10:24.284]  They want you to be happy with it.
[02:10:24.304 --> 02:10:25.825]  And it just... By the way, I agree with you.
[02:10:25.845 --> 02:10:26.565]  They're squirming.
[02:10:26.665 --> 02:10:32.666]  All of this martial law garbage, all this the CIA is going to kill Trump supporters, all this we're going to get you is a sign of weakness.
[02:10:33.066 --> 02:10:34.267]  You don't do this when you're strong.
[02:10:34.287 --> 02:10:35.067]  You do this when you're weak.
[02:10:36.411 --> 02:10:36.632]  Yeah.
[02:10:37.092 --> 02:10:39.373]  And they see what's coming with blockchain, in my opinion.
[02:10:39.653 --> 02:10:40.734]  And they know that they can't.
[02:10:40.754 --> 02:10:41.835]  They're trying to get out in front of it.
[02:10:41.855 --> 02:10:50.500]  That's why we have a lot of the big banks coming in, like JP Morgan, you know, on one hand saying, you know, Jamie Dimon from JP Morgan saying Bitcoin is, you know, rat poison and trash and all that stuff.
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:57.604]  And then, meanwhile, the same time he was making those statements, he was having backroom meetings with Brian Armstrong, who is the CEO of Coinbase.
[02:10:57.625 --> 02:10:58.585]  No relation to me, by the way.
[02:10:58.605 --> 02:10:59.526]  We do have the same last name.
[02:11:00.767 --> 02:11:03.971]  You know, and there's just a lot of scary stuff going on with Gray Reset.
[02:11:03.991 --> 02:11:05.433]  It's just now so out in the open.
[02:11:05.453 --> 02:11:16.348]  I hope that the message that we talk about on this channel, on my channel, on BitBoy Crypto, can in some way aid people to feel the responsibility to move over to blockchain.
[02:11:16.948 --> 02:11:27.873]  If you have that option to move over to cryptocurrency, and with the dollar failing... Well, it's certainly good to diversify, and I'm gonna be forced to move heavily into all this, because, I mean, Biden is here to kill the dollar and kill the country, that's his mission.
[02:11:28.033 --> 02:11:31.795]  People go, well, it's so unpopular, they stole the election, of course they're carrying out an unpopular mission.
[02:11:31.815 --> 02:11:33.476]  People keep going, that's gonna hurt them in the elections.
[02:11:33.976 --> 02:11:36.057]  Uh, no, they're bringing in HR1 to submit fraud.
[02:11:36.437 --> 02:11:40.479]  I mean, bottom line, people better get prepared and they better start hedging their bets.
[02:11:41.704 --> 02:11:48.246]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the interesting thing is I've been telling my family for years about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and finally, they've all gotten in over this year.
[02:11:48.306 --> 02:11:49.006]  It's interesting.
[02:11:49.026 --> 02:11:52.987]  It's not because they see the money that I've made with crypto.
[02:11:53.047 --> 02:11:56.828]  It's not because they, you know, want to get a Lambo, as we say in crypto.
[02:11:57.228 --> 02:12:02.389]  It's because they see what's happening with the dollar, and they've been looking already for ways to get out of it.
[02:12:02.829 --> 02:12:08.771]  And cryptocurrency, at least, you know, during this part of our Bitcoin cycle, is going to be your best bet against that.
[02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:12.293]  Yeah, I mean, I think everybody should start learning more about it and doing some.
[02:12:12.333 --> 02:12:13.734]  For the average person, I wouldn't do it.
[02:12:14.115 --> 02:12:16.096]  Don't put anything in it that you can't stand to lose.
[02:12:16.136 --> 02:12:18.918]  The problem is, if the dollar goes down, you lose everything anyway.
[02:12:18.978 --> 02:12:22.621]  So, they've put us in this volatile, dangerous position.
[02:12:22.661 --> 02:12:25.503]  That's not Bitcoin's fault that things are volatile.
[02:12:25.583 --> 02:12:27.344]  And so, it just becomes another escape pod.
[02:12:28.525 --> 02:12:29.185]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:12:29.245 --> 02:12:31.287]  I mean, we're seeing that up and down the board right now.
[02:12:32.088 --> 02:12:34.249]  All right, BitBoy Crypto.
[02:12:34.289 --> 02:12:35.910]  Ben Armstrong, please join us again soon.
[02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:36.691]  I really appreciate you.
[02:12:37.861 --> 02:12:38.982]  Yeah, thanks Alex for having me on.
[02:12:39.022 --> 02:12:40.903]  Definitely been a blast being here.
[02:12:41.163 --> 02:12:41.963]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:12:42.503 --> 02:12:43.464]  Alright, there they go.
[02:12:43.544 --> 02:12:44.664]  BitBoy Crypto.
[02:12:44.724 --> 02:12:45.305]  Easy to find.
[02:12:45.505 --> 02:12:47.986]  We got a great American patriot coming up.
[02:12:48.306 --> 02:12:49.987]  Gerald Cilente on the other side.
[02:12:50.027 --> 02:12:50.527]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:51.508 --> 02:12:53.128]  Gerald Cilente is about to take over.
[02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:57.110]  And then the War Room is in T-minus 53 minutes.
[02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:04.554]  I am not afraid, and I won't go down in flames, because tonight I'm going to be John Wayne.
[02:13:04.614 --> 02:13:05.956]  Thanks for bringing us in, Billy Idol.
[02:13:06.957 --> 02:13:09.699]  Look, I don't have George Soros backing me.
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:11.061]  I have you backing me.
[02:13:11.321 --> 02:13:15.906]  And 50 Democrat lawsuits, over 50, we've knocked them down to about five.
[02:13:17.247 --> 02:13:19.289]  And we intend to try to stay on air.
[02:13:20.110 --> 02:13:22.832]  But we had to build our own infrastructure.
[02:13:23.953 --> 02:13:27.494]  We have our own encoders, our own satellite uplinks, our own servers, our own systems.
[02:13:27.514 --> 02:13:31.495]  And I've explained this a lot, I won't tell the story that much in the future, but I have to tell you.
[02:13:32.135 --> 02:13:35.596]  This phone is hundreds of billions of dollars of investment and research.
[02:13:35.636 --> 02:13:38.336]  It's a supercomputer that interfaces into other supercomputers.
[02:13:39.016 --> 02:13:42.097]  They don't give us access to that infrastructure.
[02:13:42.137 --> 02:13:48.558]  We had to build the infrastructure, $30 million of it, to be able to even stay on air.
[02:13:48.618 --> 02:13:50.559]  They took the servers, they took everything.
[02:13:51.735 --> 02:13:54.458]  The satellite scramblers, the whole nine yards.
[02:13:54.498 --> 02:13:56.019]  And this place is like NASA, okay?
[02:13:56.059 --> 02:13:57.601]  It's not like an Elon Musk base.
[02:13:57.621 --> 02:13:58.542]  That's tens of billions of dollars.
[02:13:58.582 --> 02:14:01.745]  But that's where the money goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:02.365 --> 02:14:03.667]  And that's how you fund us.
[02:14:03.687 --> 02:14:04.547]  So it's a war.
[02:14:04.608 --> 02:14:09.392]  And we've got to stay on air now more than ever to expose how the COVID vaccine is killing old people.
[02:14:09.452 --> 02:14:10.433]  It's math euthanasia.
[02:14:10.453 --> 02:14:11.995]  They're just conditioning us to accept it.
[02:14:13.257 --> 02:14:16.479]  We've got to stay on air, in the face of this, because everybody else is getting taken down.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:18.761]  I mean, my God, they took off Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:14:18.981 --> 02:14:20.002]  off of Instagram.
[02:14:20.443 --> 02:14:27.248]  There should be a criminal investigation of that, because Bill Gates is heavily invested in Facebook and Instagram, and his aide-de-camp is Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:14:27.948 --> 02:14:33.453]  And he published real stuff, how Gates has been thrown out of 30-plus countries, how he buys off the health departments of nations.
[02:14:33.913 --> 02:14:34.914]  And they said, you can't do that.
[02:14:35.374 --> 02:14:36.315]  We say it's disinfo.
[02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:39.316]  And now they're coming after your bank accounts.
[02:14:39.336 --> 02:14:40.057]  Now they're coming after everything.
[02:14:40.077 --> 02:14:40.958]  It's so serious.
[02:14:41.618 --> 02:14:42.959]  So I believe in diversification.
[02:14:43.019 --> 02:14:51.084]  Gold, silver, bitcoin, whatever it is, land, friends, people you can trust, a garden, being healthy.
[02:14:51.124 --> 02:14:53.866]  Not that I'm perfect, but what Gerald Slundy talks about, that's the number one thing is being healthy.
[02:14:54.207 --> 02:14:55.668]  You know, having your brain right.
[02:14:56.590 --> 02:14:57.550]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[02:14:57.590 --> 02:15:00.251]  But we've got a great win-win situation.
[02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:01.572]  And again, it's kind of bittersweet.
[02:15:01.592 --> 02:15:04.553]  I'm a little pissed off about this at myself because I do all the quote marketing myself.
[02:15:04.953 --> 02:15:13.817]  No one told me for the last six months that Alexa Pure water filters, the highest end quality ones we have, it's lower price than other gravity-fed filters that aren't even as good.
[02:15:13.837 --> 02:15:16.778]  I mean, it's the top of the line and a very affordable price.
[02:15:16.798 --> 02:15:17.738]  $50 off right now.
[02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.549]  All right.
[02:15:44.441 --> 02:15:47.182]  I'll tell you what else has been sold out.
[02:15:47.202 --> 02:15:48.943]  Wintersun, high quality vitamin D3, back in stock.
[02:16:01.427 --> 02:16:02.928]  Uh, 25% off, it's a limited supply.
[02:16:02.948 --> 02:16:07.810]  50% off, Ultra 12, because we got a big supply of that, and thank God, didn't have a problem getting that.
[02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:09.311]  Highest quality, B12, take it all the time.
[02:16:09.691 --> 02:16:10.332]  Essential!
[02:16:10.832 --> 02:16:13.793]  Essential means you gotta have it, or anything will come along and kill you.
[02:16:14.173 --> 02:16:16.234]  For your immune system, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:16:18.096 --> 02:16:18.796]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:16:18.916 --> 02:16:23.120]  This is organic, liquid concentrated under the tongue, so it's like taking a shot.
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:25.702]  You absorb a lot more of it than in the gut.
[02:16:26.302 --> 02:16:27.704]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:27.724 --> 02:16:29.645]  Without you funding us, we will not be here.
[02:16:29.945 --> 02:16:31.867]  So thank you for the support.
[02:16:31.907 --> 02:16:32.968]  Get a t-shirt while you're there as well.
[02:16:33.308 --> 02:16:37.251]  All right, Gerald Salente, the Trends Forecaster, good friend of mine.
[02:16:38.232 --> 02:16:38.893]  It was great.
[02:16:39.513 --> 02:16:44.737]  And what he hit upon, I don't know the quote exactly, he said, with blockchain, rules with no rulers, and I believe he said government with no government.
[02:17:07.083 --> 02:17:10.345]  One of my top trends was about three years ago.
[02:17:10.365 --> 02:17:13.768]  I called it blockchain democracy.
[02:17:15.369 --> 02:17:21.013]  Blockchain democracy means that we the people decide what we want to do.
[02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:25.336]  We don't have representatives representing us.
[02:17:25.956 --> 02:17:35.363]  Only little imbeciles and morons and stupid little jerks believe that their congressmen and senators represent them.
[02:17:36.127 --> 02:17:41.068]  All they have to do is look at a thing called campaign contributions.
[02:17:41.829 --> 02:17:51.051]  That's what the morons, imbeciles, and the slimy, low-life, crap, garbage education system we have teaches them.
[02:17:52.111 --> 02:17:53.532]  They don't represent us.
[02:17:53.572 --> 02:17:55.552]  They're called bribes and payoffs.
[02:17:56.553 --> 02:17:59.694]  So I want to have a system of direct democracy.
[02:18:00.594 --> 02:18:01.254]  Switzerland,
[02:18:02.182 --> 02:18:10.287]  You know, that country right in the middle of Europe over there, World War I, World War II, never been in a war since, eh, about 1850.
[02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:13.770]  Direct democracy.
[02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:16.031]  Who's the president of Switzerland?
[02:18:16.431 --> 02:18:17.212]  Nobody knows.
[02:18:18.152 --> 02:18:19.133]  The people vote.
[02:18:20.254 --> 02:18:23.876]  Oh, you want to put up that thing, you know, the, whatever.
[02:18:24.577 --> 02:18:25.537]  No, we don't want it.
[02:18:26.718 --> 02:18:27.639]  The people vote.
[02:18:28.259 --> 02:18:29.500]  Direct democracy.
[02:18:30.129 --> 02:18:34.298]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea...
[02:18:35.586 --> 02:18:39.767]  Look at their so-called representatives to represent them.
[02:18:39.787 --> 02:18:40.167]  Totally.
[02:18:40.207 --> 02:18:41.007]  Let me throw this at you.
[02:18:41.047 --> 02:18:42.587]  Let me throw this at you and I'm going to let you host.
[02:18:43.168 --> 02:18:46.548]  What do you make of now Biden coming out?
[02:18:46.948 --> 02:18:55.190]  The Miami Herald reports he's got a study group about to announce domestic checkpoints and restricting people going to certain states to punish DeSantis.
[02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:59.351]  So now, like the beginning of the Civil War, he's going to blockade a state?
[02:18:59.391 --> 02:19:01.451]  He does it like, I mean, this is crazy.
[02:19:01.691 --> 02:19:03.912]  This is these people have just like gone off the deep end.
[02:19:04.352 --> 02:19:05.412]  That's what I'm saying, Alex.
[02:19:05.472 --> 02:19:06.553]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:19:06.893 --> 02:19:08.693]  They have no right to do this.
[02:19:09.073 --> 02:19:10.373]  And your guest said it.
[02:19:10.813 --> 02:19:12.354]  Rules without rulers.
[02:19:13.054 --> 02:19:14.074]  We decide.
[02:19:14.314 --> 02:19:15.515]  You want to go to war?
[02:19:15.815 --> 02:19:16.815]  Let the people vote.
[02:19:17.175 --> 02:19:18.375]  You want to put up the wall?
[02:19:18.775 --> 02:19:19.695]  Let the people vote.
[02:19:19.715 --> 02:19:20.196]  No, I agree.
[02:19:20.236 --> 02:19:24.617]  And things like real digital currencies allow us to go have our own thing.
[02:19:24.637 --> 02:19:25.317]  They don't control.
[02:19:25.357 --> 02:19:26.277]  We've got to have our own things.
[02:19:27.397 --> 02:19:27.857]  That's it.
[02:19:28.137 --> 02:19:29.078]  Let the people vote.
[02:19:29.138 --> 02:19:30.958]  And with blockchain, we could do it.
[02:19:31.559 --> 02:19:34.463]  This system of voting is ridiculously stupid!
[02:19:34.863 --> 02:19:42.552]  And these little slimy pieces of crap, these politicians are going to say, well, you know, the blockchain could be hacked.
[02:19:42.993 --> 02:19:44.054]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:44.094 --> 02:19:45.636]  They're transferring billions of dollars.
[02:19:45.676 --> 02:19:49.160]  Yeah, like Bank of America spying on their users and hanging over the FBI without a warrant.
[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:49.901]  Look at this.
[02:19:50.361 --> 02:19:58.489]  What do you make of this slimy, talking about slimy, Jamie Raskin, the head Democrat lawyer, says Trump supporters burnt down that church that Black Lives Matter did.
[02:19:58.709 --> 02:20:01.291]  They're telling whopper lies bigger and bigger.
[02:20:01.331 --> 02:20:03.073]  It's like they do it on purpose.
[02:20:03.113 --> 02:20:03.854]  It's insane.
[02:20:03.874 --> 02:20:06.176]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:20:06.516 --> 02:20:10.780]  But I want to go back to direct democracy is our only freedom.
[02:20:11.541 --> 02:20:14.684]  How could anybody look up to a Mitch McConnell
[02:20:15.399 --> 02:20:22.304]  A Lindsey Graham, a Nancy Pelosi, a not-so-Feinstein, a little Chuckie Schumer.
[02:20:22.364 --> 02:20:23.185]  No, I know, I know.
[02:20:23.205 --> 02:20:24.446]  You hammer that, you do a great job.
[02:20:24.586 --> 02:20:31.632]  I'm just simply saying, they have escalated now, where they say they want the CIA to kill citizens, they want to put us in re-education camps.
[02:20:31.692 --> 02:20:33.693]  It makes everything I say sound tame.
[02:20:34.053 --> 02:20:36.635]  I predicted this, but they've gone completely nuts.
[02:20:36.696 --> 02:20:40.378]  What would you call this period of them sounding like they're rewriting 1984 in 2021?
[02:20:43.433 --> 02:20:47.115]  It's a mixture between fascism and communism.
[02:20:48.216 --> 02:20:55.820]  Again, that they could censor, as you said, John F. Kennedy's nephew.
[02:20:56.860 --> 02:20:59.802]  That they could censor the President of the United States.
[02:21:00.763 --> 02:21:02.544]  That they take you off the air.
[02:21:02.904 --> 02:21:05.085]  I get censored on LinkedIn all the time.
[02:21:06.105 --> 02:21:07.806]  They are in complete control.
[02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:10.388]  And if we don't regain control,
[02:21:11.354 --> 02:21:16.677]  Then we're lost and what is going back to Bitcoin and digital currencies.
[02:21:17.157 --> 02:21:20.779]  They don't want them because that buys us our freedom.
[02:21:21.279 --> 02:21:21.499]  What?
[02:21:21.719 --> 02:21:23.060]  Look what's just happened!
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:24.540]  Look what just happened!
[02:21:24.841 --> 02:21:27.922]  They brought in the head of the central bank!
[02:21:28.802 --> 02:21:33.705]  The central bank head to be the Treasury Secretary?
[02:21:34.548 --> 02:21:36.589]  And then they brought in this guy Lipton?
[02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:38.591]  Yeah, not a cup of tea!
[02:21:38.911 --> 02:21:39.972]  A cup of crap!
[02:21:40.332 --> 02:21:43.994]  That's from the IMF to be the assistant on the... That's right.
[02:21:44.014 --> 02:21:45.895]  Gerald Cilente, stay there.
[02:21:46.095 --> 02:21:47.136]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:21:47.156 --> 02:21:49.498]  He takes over on the other side of this quick break.
[02:21:49.598 --> 02:21:50.718]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:21:51.079 --> 02:21:53.480]  I'm with Band.Video and Infowars.com.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:54.801]  Please share those links, folks.
[02:21:54.821 --> 02:21:55.922]  It's how we get around the censors.
[02:21:56.162 --> 02:21:56.982]  It's an InfoWar.
[02:21:57.623 --> 02:22:00.044]  Thank you, thank you, thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:22:01.761 --> 02:22:06.884]  All the great staff at InfoWars, I really love being on, do a great job.
[02:22:06.944 --> 02:22:12.227]  And as Alex said, you know, put your money where, or I say, put your money where your mind is.
[02:22:12.247 --> 02:22:13.588]  They're censoring everybody.
[02:22:14.369 --> 02:22:19.912]  And InfoWars is doing everything they can, using everything they have to make it happen.
[02:22:20.733 --> 02:22:22.333]  And so the products are great.
[02:22:22.394 --> 02:22:27.196]  You know, as I, my Supermeal Vitality's one of my favorite.
[02:22:27.757 --> 02:22:29.698]  You know, you gotta keep things going.
[02:22:30.775 --> 02:22:38.659]  And, uh, the super male vitality, you know, when you get to all the cat, you need that extra jive, you know, and this gives you the boost.
[02:22:39.659 --> 02:22:46.583]  You know, the, um, going back to the gentleman that was on talking about rules with no rulers.
[02:22:46.843 --> 02:22:50.504]  I mean, this is a new, the system is totally corrupt and broken.
[02:22:52.045 --> 02:22:55.347]  And to me, direct democracy is the only way to do it.
[02:22:55.367 --> 02:22:57.928]  And the point I wanted to make is you could take a transfer
[02:22:58.607 --> 02:23:03.550]  Trillions of dollars like that in a millisecond around the world.
[02:23:04.371 --> 02:23:05.291]  Big banksters.
[02:23:06.012 --> 02:23:08.414]  You mean we can't vote and have safe voting?
[02:23:08.754 --> 02:23:09.634]  Oh no, I know!
[02:23:09.654 --> 02:23:14.257]  The voting system that we have now, that's really great!
[02:23:14.758 --> 02:23:17.720]  We don't need a high-tech blockchain voting.
[02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:20.982]  And this is what I've been calling for for years.
[02:23:21.662 --> 02:23:25.605]  Blockchain voting and blockchain democracy.
[02:23:26.283 --> 02:23:29.144]  It's moronic and imbecilic that we don't have both of them.
[02:23:29.565 --> 02:23:31.425]  And it's up to the people to make it happen.
[02:23:32.006 --> 02:23:33.747]  These people don't rule me.
[02:23:34.547 --> 02:23:35.988]  They are not my rulers.
[02:23:37.748 --> 02:23:39.729]  You know, they don't, I am an American.
[02:23:39.809 --> 02:23:41.170]  I'm born to be free.
[02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:43.871]  I don't take orders and I don't give orders.
[02:23:44.772 --> 02:23:53.896]  And now we got this, as I said, to me, it's a, it's a mixture between, between fascism and communism that's running our nation.
[02:23:55.129 --> 02:23:59.392]  And what they're doing, you know, it's one country after another.
[02:24:00.112 --> 02:24:10.118]  We've also told our subscribers to the Trends Journal, don't waste one ounce of energy following the impeachment process.
[02:24:12.100 --> 02:24:13.901]  Go back to the first impeachment.
[02:24:13.921 --> 02:24:14.661]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:24:15.001 --> 02:24:19.044]  Maybe, I think Fauci's the guy on the left with the body condom.
[02:24:19.619 --> 02:24:21.800]  Yeah, maybe we should be using body condoms.
[02:24:22.221 --> 02:24:27.684]  And don't forget to sanitize your hands before you do anything, you know, to yourself or anybody else.
[02:24:28.024 --> 02:24:28.785]  You know, look at this.
[02:24:30.446 --> 02:24:36.409]  So going back to, it's up to us to have a free country.
[02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:42.813]  And censorship is now the new normal or abnormal.
[02:24:43.293 --> 02:24:47.616]  And as I'm mentioning, don't waste an ounce of energy on the impeachment.
[02:24:48.316 --> 02:24:49.417]  And there's a reason for it.
[02:24:50.404 --> 02:24:51.965]  Go back to the first impeachment.
[02:24:52.425 --> 02:25:03.813]  As soon as they did it, as soon as they talked about it, we told our subscribers, don't waste one second of your valuable life and putting your energy into this when you could be putting it at more positive things.
[02:25:04.574 --> 02:25:07.496]  Like learning about what in the world is going on and how to prepare for it.
[02:25:08.497 --> 02:25:11.179]  Because you're not going to impeach Trump.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:20.005]  They have a majority in the Senate and they need a super majority, what, 67 votes to impeach him.
[02:25:20.558 --> 02:25:23.019]  To convict him, it ain't gonna happen in the Senate.
[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:24.460]  And of course it didn't.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:25.881]  It was a complete waste of time.
[02:25:26.341 --> 02:25:33.725]  And, and, and these little slimy lowlife pieces of scum, garbage crap.
[02:25:36.787 --> 02:25:39.168]  Murderers and thieves, little jerks.
[02:25:39.768 --> 02:25:40.169]  Look at them!
[02:25:40.549 --> 02:25:41.029]  Look at them!
[02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:42.370]  Look at them!
[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:44.051]  These are your leaders!
[02:25:45.390 --> 02:25:47.111]  They're wasting our money.
[02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:50.231]  They steal our money in the name of taxes to do it.
[02:25:50.572 --> 02:25:52.632]  And look at the high life that they live.
[02:25:53.592 --> 02:25:56.833]  Again, don't waste your time.
[02:25:56.994 --> 02:25:58.754]  Round two, impeachment two.
[02:25:58.774 --> 02:26:01.195]  They're not going to convict Trump.
[02:26:01.895 --> 02:26:03.636]  It's a waste of time.
[02:26:04.596 --> 02:26:07.557]  Put your energy into something more valuable.
[02:26:08.037 --> 02:26:12.898]  This is not, this isn't, Congress isn't bipartisan.
[02:26:12.918 --> 02:26:14.959]  They're bipolar.
[02:26:15.552 --> 02:26:15.992]  All right?
[02:26:17.073 --> 02:26:17.893]  Bipolar.
[02:26:20.934 --> 02:26:27.517]  A psychiatric illness characterized by both manic and depressive episodes.
[02:26:31.139 --> 02:26:32.099]  And that's what you got.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.300]  Look at this little piece of crap.
[02:26:34.701 --> 02:26:36.581]  Look at this little jerk!
[02:26:37.542 --> 02:26:40.583]  One after another, one after another.
[02:26:40.683 --> 02:26:44.465]  I was watching a guy when I went shopping for the first time.
[02:26:45.037 --> 02:26:53.465]  Since before Christmas, because I hate going out with these stupid masks on, like this, and watching everybody, blah blah blah.
[02:26:54.246 --> 02:27:01.994]  And I had a TV on, and there was this guy, you know, he was like a reverend out there talking about what's going on.
[02:27:02.454 --> 02:27:05.998]  And there was some congress, some senator, congressman, a jerk!
[02:27:06.926 --> 02:27:09.528]  I mean, these things, these stupid masks, now wear two.
[02:27:09.988 --> 02:27:12.130]  And no, no, no, we're not saying wear two.
[02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:14.752]  You know, go back to the cover of the Trends Journal.
[02:27:15.252 --> 02:27:16.473]  Wear your body condom.
[02:27:16.794 --> 02:27:17.754]  That'll protect you.
[02:27:18.295 --> 02:27:20.296]  Oh yeah, Fauci's gonna be selling them.
[02:27:20.997 --> 02:27:22.598]  Body condoms by Fauci.
[02:27:23.138 --> 02:27:24.820]  Yeah, a real whack-off.
[02:27:26.541 --> 02:27:29.183]  And don't forget to use your hand sanitizer when you do it.
[02:27:30.104 --> 02:27:31.725]  What a bunch of garbage.
[02:27:33.366 --> 02:27:35.588]  So, going on to what's going on.
[02:27:37.981 --> 02:27:43.244]  I want to read you some things and why it's important to look ahead and into trends.
[02:27:44.024 --> 02:27:52.228]  This is from July of last year.
[02:27:53.169 --> 02:27:55.270]  Banks prepare for wave of loan defaults.
[02:27:56.150 --> 02:28:02.133]  JPMorgan Citigroup, Wells Fargo set aside $20 billion, $28 billion to cover pandemic losses.
[02:28:02.193 --> 02:28:04.554]  Not pandemic losses, lockdown losses.
[02:28:05.014 --> 02:28:05.915]  It goes on to say,
[02:28:07.762 --> 02:28:08.102]  J.P.
[02:28:08.122 --> 02:28:09.182]  Morgan, the largest U.S.
[02:28:09.242 --> 02:28:31.507]  bank by asset, said it put aside extra to prepare for an unemployment rate that remains at double digits well into next year and a slower recovery in gross domestic product, ready, than the bank's economists assumed three months ago.
[02:28:32.767 --> 02:28:33.488]  Assumed, A.S.S.
[02:28:37.017 --> 02:28:37.958]  O-U-M-E-D.
[02:28:39.879 --> 02:28:40.439]  As soon.
[02:28:43.801 --> 02:28:46.282]  Business travel could take years to recover.
[02:28:48.504 --> 02:28:57.349]  Again, this is what, New York Times, I believe, and it's 7-15, July 15th.
[02:28:58.169 --> 02:29:06.114]  While business travel evaporated in a flash when the coronavirus hit, it may take two to three years for total recovery.
[02:29:07.032 --> 02:29:17.975]  Far longer than many travel experts initially predicted.
[02:29:18.615 --> 02:29:22.076]  Travel experts, economic experts.
[02:29:22.576 --> 02:29:25.256]  How about small-minded little people?
[02:29:26.817 --> 02:29:31.698]  Trade show industry awaits a world when people can mingle again.
[02:29:32.498 --> 02:29:35.639]  This is from the Financial Times, August 9th, 2020.
[02:29:37.844 --> 02:29:46.811]  The guy goes on to say, from Stephen Carter, the world's largest event company, said, I'm not worried about business model.
[02:29:47.412 --> 02:29:50.274]  Event companies will be able to make it margins again.
[02:29:50.294 --> 02:29:54.657]  Informer, which has lost two-fifths of a block.
[02:29:54.697 --> 02:30:02.704]  Now he goes on to tell the FTC that after admitting that the crisis would be, quote,
[02:30:03.465 --> 02:30:10.907]  Significantly deeper, more volatile, and wide-reaching than it first envisioned.
[02:30:13.587 --> 02:30:13.927]  Got it?
[02:30:14.767 --> 02:30:16.048]  Hello, hello!
[02:30:16.648 --> 02:30:19.408]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:30:19.428 --> 02:30:25.189]  You know, look, you see what's going on.
[02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:29.130]  They're censoring people all over the world.
[02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:30.470]  It's not only here.
[02:30:31.331 --> 02:30:32.591]  They had that big farmer's
[02:30:33.533 --> 02:30:35.354]  Demonstration going on in India.
[02:30:35.834 --> 02:30:38.196]  We've been writing about it every week in the Trends Journal.
[02:30:39.016 --> 02:30:40.257]  It's going on since November.
[02:30:40.297 --> 02:30:41.357]  They're camped out there.
[02:30:41.377 --> 02:30:42.578]  They're fighting them.
[02:30:42.618 --> 02:30:48.942]  But anyway, Twitter banned the farmers from sending messages back and forth.
[02:30:49.882 --> 02:30:55.385]  And I'm mentioning this because censorship and again, that was one of our top trends a number of years ago.
[02:30:55.886 --> 02:31:00.248]  Censorship 2.0 is going to continue and it's going to only get worse.
[02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.529]  So,
[02:31:02.236 --> 02:31:04.738]  It's very important that you keep the truth alive.
[02:31:05.938 --> 02:31:12.603]  And one of the ways you can do it is by supporting InfoWars and buying the great products that they have.
[02:31:13.343 --> 02:31:25.831]  And they have some great sales going on right now and TurboCharge is one of them to give you that charge that you could really use for your defenses with these incredible new sales.
[02:31:26.532 --> 02:31:29.834]  And because of the slow destruction of the supply chain,
[02:31:31.003 --> 02:31:34.924]  They're having to end sales on some of their fan-favorite products.
[02:31:35.424 --> 02:31:42.286]  But InfoWars wants you to be able to turbocharge your body's natural defense for less.
[02:31:43.007 --> 02:31:48.988]  So they're bringing you fresh new sales on other classic InfoWar life products.
[02:31:49.649 --> 02:31:53.130]  Winter Sun Plus, selling out fast, 25% off.
[02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:57.091]  DNA Force Plus, that's selling out fast, 25% off.
[02:31:58.755 --> 02:32:02.256]  Ultra 12, it's back in stock, 50% off.

[02:32:06.998 --> 02:32:09.379]  Lung Cleanse, it's back in stock.
[02:32:10.719 --> 02:32:16.561]  Nescent Iodine Surface Spray, 50% off.
[02:32:16.601 --> 02:32:21.463]  All the other, the Liquid Pure Turmeric, the Lung Cleanse, they're 50% off too.
[02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:29.813]  So new shipments are always coming in and Ultra 12 and Lung Cleanse Plus are the newest batches.
[02:32:29.853 --> 02:32:31.433]  You could get them both.
[02:32:31.973 --> 02:32:36.515]  These powerhouse products are 50% off, but it's only going to be for a limited time.
[02:32:37.175 --> 02:32:51.981]  So if you want to make sure you're ready for the coming year and empowering your mind and body for success, you can get these brand new sales on classic InfoWars favorites today at InfoWars stores
[02:32:54.992 --> 02:32:57.534]  So do what you can do to support the truth.
[02:32:58.355 --> 02:33:00.957]  Because they're going to keep stealing it from us.
[02:33:01.698 --> 02:33:05.741]  And with the Biden administration, it's only going to get much, much worse.
[02:33:06.662 --> 02:33:08.804]  It's it's the Obama administration.
[02:33:08.924 --> 02:33:13.467]  Actually, I was mentioning to Alex before that they brought in this guy Lipton.
[02:33:14.268 --> 02:33:15.169]  He was with Obama.
[02:33:15.209 --> 02:33:17.190]  He's been a member of the club forever.
[02:33:17.951 --> 02:33:20.193]  And now he's like a special counsel to
[02:33:22.182 --> 02:33:24.103]  Janet Yellen, our Treasury Secretary.
[02:33:24.143 --> 02:33:25.364]  You got this, everybody?
[02:33:25.784 --> 02:33:31.107]  We got the IMF and the Federal Reserve Bank in charge of the Treasury.
[02:33:32.347 --> 02:33:34.028]  We don't have a country anymore.
[02:33:35.509 --> 02:33:36.850]  It's totally taken over.
[02:33:38.290 --> 02:33:45.974]  And it goes back to the gentleman that was on talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
[02:33:47.115 --> 02:33:51.297]  And I believe totally in blockchain democracy and blockchain voting.
[02:33:51.912 --> 02:34:03.682]  And also, again, as I was saying before, how backwards the news and information is, and that's why I'm recommending you don't waste your time watching stupid crap.
[02:34:04.503 --> 02:34:06.705]  This is from the Toilet Paper of Record.
[02:34:06.765 --> 02:34:09.327]  They call themselves the Paper of Record, the New York Times.
[02:34:10.148 --> 02:34:11.649]  All the news that's fit to print.
[02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:14.312]  Who the hell are you telling me what's fit to print?
[02:34:14.712 --> 02:34:17.775]  Who the hell are you, you little
[02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:19.090]  Jerks!
[02:34:19.651 --> 02:34:22.173]  To tell me what is fit to print!
[02:34:22.493 --> 02:34:23.434]  Oh no, Solenti!
[02:34:23.854 --> 02:34:25.355]  Wear the paper a record!
[02:34:26.296 --> 02:34:27.577]  All the news that's fit to print.
[02:34:27.597 --> 02:34:29.198]  You know what these little slime balls did?
[02:34:29.919 --> 02:34:31.840]  They called me pessimism porn.
[02:34:32.781 --> 02:34:34.342]  When I forecast the panic of 08.
[02:34:35.583 --> 02:34:36.123]  That's right.
[02:34:37.444 --> 02:34:39.006]  Oh, was it going to be that bad?
[02:34:39.126 --> 02:34:40.127]  I was pessimistic.
[02:34:40.467 --> 02:34:41.468]  No, no, Junior.
[02:34:41.948 --> 02:34:44.530]  Anyway, right here from the toilet paper.
[02:34:45.379 --> 02:35:13.906]  I was mentioning to you about how they all got it wrong, how they didn't see it coming, that after admitting that the crisis would be significantly deeper, more volatile and wide-reaching than first envisioned, then far longer than many experts initially predicted, and slow recovery in gross domestic product and banks and economists had assumed, assumed,
[02:35:14.810 --> 02:35:15.850]  And then here it is again.
[02:35:15.870 --> 02:35:24.794]  And this is from Zip Recruiter, New York Times, August 7th, 2020.
[02:35:27.175 --> 02:35:30.036]  An announcement on impending layoffs continue to pile up.
[02:35:30.396 --> 02:35:30.536]  Ms.
[02:35:30.616 --> 02:35:34.377]  Pollack from Zip Recruiter has been tracking plant closings and layoffs.
[02:35:35.138 --> 02:35:37.959]  The government requires to be announced in advance.
[02:35:38.339 --> 02:35:41.320]  Quote, they're still showing that new signs of layoffs are coming.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.041]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:43.661 --> 02:35:43.801]  And
[02:35:45.453 --> 02:35:54.280]  Many companies are realizing now that the effects will be much longer than expected, she said.
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:36:02.626]  I'm mentioning this because it's much worse than anybody expected.
[02:36:03.727 --> 02:36:04.967]  It's right there.
[02:36:05.188 --> 02:36:07.109]  I'm reading it to you, the facts.
[02:36:07.549 --> 02:36:09.611]  They do not see what's ahead.
[02:36:12.313 --> 02:36:13.354]  Do you realize
[02:36:15.239 --> 02:36:34.864]  If you go to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, or become one of those Rhodes Scholars that keep, you know, the gang in charge, not one of them, not one of them teaches trend forecasting.
[02:36:36.124 --> 02:36:36.465]  I'm it.
[02:36:38.065 --> 02:36:41.686]  Hey, my book's Trend Tracking Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[02:36:42.262 --> 02:36:46.846]  Trends 2000, Trends Journal, only been doing it 41 years.
[02:36:47.946 --> 02:36:49.608]  They don't see the future.
[02:36:50.128 --> 02:36:52.130]  They can't see past yesterday.
[02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:55.212]  Yeah, Read Time magazine, great.
[02:36:57.013 --> 02:36:58.514]  Last week's news next week.
[02:36:59.735 --> 02:37:03.338]  I'm mentioning this to you because you better prepare for this future.
[02:37:04.359 --> 02:37:06.020]  It's like we've never seen before.
[02:37:08.222 --> 02:37:10.964]  Alex talks about how they're robbing us of our rights, so do we.
[02:37:12.418 --> 02:37:14.939]  How the vaccinations, you know what they're doing?
[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:18.381]  We're reporting on it, InfoWars does too.
[02:37:19.562 --> 02:37:22.884]  And we're looking at the economic ups and downs.
[02:37:24.565 --> 02:37:28.867]  The markets are a total hoax.
[02:37:29.548 --> 02:37:33.450]  Totally unrelated to Wall Street is Main Street.
[02:37:34.571 --> 02:37:35.791]  It's a gangster mob.
[02:37:38.093 --> 02:37:38.873]  So you have
[02:37:39.195 --> 02:37:43.036]  Gregory Manarino writes for us too, the debt bubble, this is huge, this is a bomb.
[02:37:44.276 --> 02:37:46.897]  And you're hearing it all the time, this is unprecedented.
[02:37:47.417 --> 02:37:48.937]  Even that guy Summers came out.
[02:37:49.918 --> 02:37:50.898]  He used to be under Clinton.
[02:37:54.419 --> 02:37:56.619]  Saying that you can't keep pumping all this cheap money in.
[02:37:57.539 --> 02:38:02.040]  And that goes back to Bitcoin, silver, gold, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies.
[02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:07.742]  I forecast you're going to see gold going over $2,100 an ounce.
[02:38:09.704 --> 02:38:13.305]  And you're going to see silver going over $50 an ounce.
[02:38:14.606 --> 02:38:16.686]  And you're going to see a big crash in the markets.
[02:38:17.306 --> 02:38:17.566]  When?
[02:38:18.267 --> 02:38:21.608]  It's hard to gauge, because they rig it all the time.
[02:38:22.728 --> 02:38:38.273]  But I would say, before the end of the third quarter, and possibly sooner, like March, there's going to be a fake bounce back.
[02:38:39.332 --> 02:38:40.673]  Yeah, things are gonna get better.
[02:38:41.954 --> 02:38:50.539]  But the jobs that are lost, they're not coming back until 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:54.542]  2024, that means the ones you lost are coming.
[02:38:54.802 --> 02:38:56.523]  How about creating new jobs?
[02:38:57.664 --> 02:38:59.605]  No, not gonna happen.
[02:39:01.426 --> 02:39:03.928]  So, you better prepare.
[02:39:04.468 --> 02:39:08.791]  Prepare with your health, prepare with your mind, and prepare with your body.
[02:39:10.991 --> 02:39:16.832]  Never before, in my 41 years of doing this, have I been so concerned about the future.
[02:39:17.632 --> 02:39:20.913]  And the way things are going now, it's going to be hell on earth.
[02:39:22.453 --> 02:39:24.574]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:39:25.634 --> 02:39:27.374]  Put your money where your heart and mind are.
[02:39:28.554 --> 02:39:33.315]  We're going to do everything to shut it down, as well as trying to shut us down too at the Trends Journal.
[02:39:34.235 --> 02:39:36.376]  The more subscribers we have, the more we could do.
[02:39:36.416 --> 02:39:36.976]  We're fighting.
[02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:40.401]  For freedom, peace, and justice.
[02:39:40.621 --> 02:39:41.301]  And we'll be back.
[02:39:41.781 --> 02:39:42.641]  Hello, hello!
[02:39:42.921 --> 02:39:45.002]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:39:46.062 --> 02:39:48.723]  And again, do what you can to support them.
[02:39:49.224 --> 02:39:50.744]  And the info was, here.
[02:39:51.424 --> 02:39:54.065]  This just, this didn't make any of the major media.
[02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:56.146]  This came out yesterday.
[02:39:57.486 --> 02:40:02.748]  Fossil fuel air pollution kills twice as many as previously thought study finds.
[02:40:02.768 --> 02:40:03.888]  It's a Harvard study.
[02:40:05.489 --> 02:40:07.210]  Total estimate, 8.7 million deaths
[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:09.241]  In 2018.
[02:40:09.321 --> 02:40:14.586]  I mentioned this because how many people died in the COVID war so far?
[02:40:15.788 --> 02:40:16.408]  Worldwide?
[02:40:17.770 --> 02:40:18.671]  And this is every year.
[02:40:20.856 --> 02:40:30.139]  So I'm mentioning this because they don't talk about... How about all those pesticides they put in the, uh... You like those pesticides they spray and then you eat the food, the chemicals?
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:31.000]  I know!
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:33.441]  Artificial flavors!
[02:40:33.961 --> 02:40:36.162]  You like those artificial flavors?
[02:40:36.502 --> 02:40:37.862]  No, the artificial colors!
[02:40:38.162 --> 02:40:39.423]  Give me the artificial colors!
[02:40:40.163 --> 02:40:43.806]  Hey, you want some diet drinks with all that aspartame in them?
[02:40:44.246 --> 02:40:47.549]  Aspartame makes me take, yeah, it's really working too.
[02:40:47.569 --> 02:40:49.070]  The obesity rate in America is only 80, 42%.
[02:40:49.971 --> 02:40:54.454]  And then they sell us the COVID war.
[02:40:54.474 --> 02:40:58.037]  I'm mentioning this because of the products that InfoWars has.
[02:40:59.058 --> 02:41:05.683]  And when you read the facts, it's, it's right here.
[02:41:07.239 --> 02:41:13.881]  Total 8.7 million deaths in 2018, just shy of the estimated 9.5 million cancer related deaths.
[02:41:14.381 --> 02:41:15.481]  And why are you getting cancer?
[02:41:15.501 --> 02:41:16.622]  Well, the same thing.
[02:41:17.342 --> 02:41:26.544]  So again, with this dirty, dirty water, dirty everything, you know, you're going to want to, you know, your Lexapur pro water filtration system, you know, things like that.
[02:41:26.564 --> 02:41:30.045]  You know, I have, you know, I, I won't drink this other stuff.
[02:41:31.565 --> 02:41:33.466]  And again, it's so important to stay healthy.
[02:41:35.037 --> 02:41:43.063]  But they're locking down the global economy rather than treating the people that are the ones that are most susceptible to the virus.
[02:41:43.423 --> 02:41:44.724]  Germany's locking down again.
[02:41:44.744 --> 02:41:48.246]  You know the average age of the people in Germany?
[02:41:48.266 --> 02:41:50.388]  It's like 80 years old.
[02:41:50.408 --> 02:41:51.729]  81 in Italy.
[02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:53.970]  What is that?
[02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:57.833]  388 people in the UK are under what?
[02:41:57.853 --> 02:41:58.374]  60 years old?
[02:41:59.775 --> 02:42:00.555]  And these are facts.
[02:42:00.615 --> 02:42:02.556]  Oh, but maybe we can't put those facts out there.
[02:42:02.576 --> 02:42:03.137]  We get banned.
[02:42:05.484 --> 02:42:11.949]  I'm mentioning this because they keep selling the fear of the COVID war where they're killing us in how many different ways.
[02:42:13.450 --> 02:42:18.254]  And now they robbed the joy and beauty out of life, freaking everybody out.
[02:42:18.715 --> 02:42:22.277]  I mean, you know, I'm a, I'm a single guy.
[02:42:22.297 --> 02:42:31.865]  And, you know, just to make it clear that, uh, what was the most important thing in my life when I was a youngster,
[02:42:32.813 --> 02:42:41.440]  Here I am in my book, What Zizzy Gave Honey Boy, the woman Doris Roberts, who played the mother in Every One Loves Raymond, the last starring role was playing my aunt in my book.
[02:42:42.301 --> 02:42:46.765]  There's me and Teresa McKelvey in the getting our first communion.
[02:42:46.845 --> 02:42:50.127]  So I like communistic kiss.
[02:42:51.208 --> 02:42:53.090]  Now they have me all drugged up for doing that.
[02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:55.251]  But anyway, it's right there.
[02:42:55.292 --> 02:42:56.633]  You know, I'm not making this up.
[02:42:57.033 --> 02:43:01.637]  So anyway, I like to go out and look at lovely sights.
[02:43:02.742 --> 02:43:04.022]  But this is what you see now.
[02:43:05.283 --> 02:43:06.543]  This is what you see now.
[02:43:08.363 --> 02:43:08.683]  Nothing.
[02:43:09.163 --> 02:43:09.463]  Nothing.
[02:43:11.424 --> 02:43:21.446]  Maybe Fauci's gonna come out and say, uh, well, you know, you wear your mask in your car, and when you go to sleep at night, put on a Fauci condom.
[02:43:22.466 --> 02:43:22.806]  Yeah.
[02:43:23.586 --> 02:43:24.026]  Why not?
[02:43:25.407 --> 02:43:26.447]  It's just as useless.
[02:43:27.147 --> 02:43:28.427]  Why do Confucius say that?
[02:43:28.467 --> 02:43:28.967]  I forget.
[02:43:30.628 --> 02:43:31.888]  Going back to the economy.
[02:43:33.837 --> 02:43:38.101]  This is from Tuesday's Financial Times.
[02:43:38.881 --> 02:43:43.625]  Investors position for bull run as commodities jump across the board.
[02:43:44.886 --> 02:43:46.788]  Now, this is what we do in the Trends Journal.
[02:43:48.669 --> 02:43:49.470]  Bull run, huh?
[02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:54.134]  I can't say the word, but the other word is after bull.
[02:43:55.595 --> 02:44:01.820]  But the important element to this story is commodities jump across the board.
[02:44:03.353 --> 02:44:05.674]  You're looking at spikes in commodity prices.
[02:44:06.715 --> 02:44:07.635]  What does that mean?
[02:44:09.196 --> 02:44:10.216]  Inflation.
[02:44:11.357 --> 02:44:12.297]  Inflation.
[02:44:12.777 --> 02:44:13.978]  Dollar going down.
[02:44:14.318 --> 02:44:15.538]  Dollar going down.
[02:44:16.879 --> 02:44:17.739]  Inflation.
[02:44:20.621 --> 02:44:25.483]  The cheaper the dollar goes, the higher precious metals prices go.
[02:44:26.163 --> 02:44:26.603]  Got it?
[02:44:28.624 --> 02:44:30.065]  That's what they're not talking about.
[02:44:31.340 --> 02:44:33.521]  We're going to look at what I call a dragflation.
[02:44:34.901 --> 02:44:41.663]  You're going to see the economy go down, but commodity prices are going up.
[02:44:41.683 --> 02:44:45.363]  And they're going to keep going up.
[02:44:47.604 --> 02:44:51.065]  Not because so much of a shortage, but because it's going to take you more money to buy them.
[02:44:52.945 --> 02:44:54.266]  Shortage is only going to be part of it.
[02:44:55.346 --> 02:44:56.246]  And the game's rigged.
[02:44:56.266 --> 02:44:59.747]  You saw it's got oil prices are now over $60 a barrel, Brent crude.
[02:45:00.472 --> 02:45:08.277]  Because OPEC plus, OPEC plus, how about the OPEC plus gang decided they're going to cut back production.
[02:45:09.238 --> 02:45:12.960]  So demand now is meeting supply closer.
[02:45:14.201 --> 02:45:16.102]  So you've seen the prices go, it's artificial.
[02:45:18.024 --> 02:45:18.984]  So these are the things.
[02:45:19.024 --> 02:45:28.651]  And the other thing I want to make a point about is again, why you subscribe to the Trends Journal and watch Info Wars, because they have agendas on the media.
[02:45:29.246 --> 02:45:31.827]  This is from the Financial Times yesterday.
[02:45:32.788 --> 02:45:34.168]  Story down the bottom here.
[02:45:36.829 --> 02:45:40.431]  Fox News plans to maintain center-right slant.
[02:45:41.551 --> 02:45:42.992]  Oh, center-right slant.
[02:45:43.352 --> 02:45:45.753]  How about over here, stupid crap?
[02:45:46.313 --> 02:45:50.515]  I could care if it's center-right, center-left, center-up, you know what?
[02:45:52.556 --> 02:45:54.317]  Don't feed me your crap!
[02:45:54.837 --> 02:45:56.358]  All I want are the facts!
[02:45:57.642 --> 02:46:02.266]  Hey, Salenti, we used to have you on here all the time on Fox News.
[02:46:02.346 --> 02:46:03.247]  Fox and Friends.
[02:46:03.747 --> 02:46:04.208]  All of them.
[02:46:04.768 --> 02:46:04.948]  Nope.
[02:46:05.369 --> 02:46:05.949]  No more.
[02:46:06.350 --> 02:46:09.252]  Because I don't go center right or center left.
[02:46:09.712 --> 02:46:10.813]  I go for facts.
[02:46:11.254 --> 02:46:13.696]  Could you little clown boys deal with facts?
[02:46:14.477 --> 02:46:14.837]  No!
[02:46:15.257 --> 02:46:16.478]  We're center right!
[02:46:16.819 --> 02:46:18.340]  You're center this!
[02:46:19.541 --> 02:46:19.781]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.402 --> 02:46:21.362]  Think I'm making it up?
[02:46:21.883 --> 02:46:23.324]  You think the headline's baloney?
[02:46:23.925 --> 02:46:25.286]  I thought it was, and I should add.
[02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:27.551]  They're using prostitute lingo.
[02:46:28.852 --> 02:46:35.777]  We believe we are targeted to the center right is exactly where we should be targeted.
[02:46:36.438 --> 02:46:38.619]  We don't need to go further right.
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:42.002]  We don't believe America is further right.
[02:46:43.002 --> 02:46:43.503]  He said.
[02:46:43.523 --> 02:46:49.007]  We will stick to where we are and we think that's exactly right.
[02:46:50.087 --> 02:46:52.649]  And it is the best thing for business.
[02:46:54.691 --> 02:46:55.031]  Murdoch.
[02:46:55.888 --> 02:46:56.428]  Alright?
[02:46:57.509 --> 02:46:58.450]  From Murdoch!
[02:47:00.871 --> 02:47:02.892]  That's the stupid junk!
[02:47:04.453 --> 02:47:05.454]  Junk news!
[02:47:07.495 --> 02:47:08.615]  That's what they're putting out!
[02:47:09.736 --> 02:47:14.219]  Junk news, junk food, junk brains!
[02:47:15.279 --> 02:47:16.640]  Welcome to America!
[02:47:18.721 --> 02:47:19.302]  Right there!
[02:47:19.322 --> 02:47:23.284]  Who the hell are you talking to, center-right?
[02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:25.951]  This isn't news!
[02:47:26.591 --> 02:47:32.414]  And then you got the, you got the, way over to the left, the Cartoon News Network.
[02:47:33.515 --> 02:47:39.518]  With Anderson Cooper, Little Daddy's Girl, oh no, Mommy's Girl, oh Mommy's Boy!
[02:47:39.798 --> 02:47:41.479]  I forgot, don't know what!
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:47.342]  Gloria Vanderbilt, oh and a little Chrissy Cuomo, the arrogant little boy.
[02:47:47.362 --> 02:47:49.864]  And a piece of lemon.
[02:47:53.394 --> 02:47:54.794]  One after another.
[02:47:56.535 --> 02:47:57.655]  One after another.
[02:47:57.715 --> 02:48:04.877]  And you talk about before about the which one about the when I have it here.
[02:48:05.997 --> 02:48:14.879]  About Kennedy getting banned on Instagram.
[02:48:15.339 --> 02:48:16.559]  Now I do with the article.
[02:48:16.579 --> 02:48:19.980]  But anyway, a quote of that guy, Tapper.
[02:48:23.730 --> 02:48:29.734]  As attacking Cuomo, what's his name?
[02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:32.776]  Here we go.
[02:48:35.037 --> 02:48:35.878]  Kennedy Jr.
[02:48:35.898 --> 02:48:43.402]  has drawn stark criticism for his anti-vaccine stance from the mainstream media with CNN's Jake Tapper.
[02:48:43.783 --> 02:48:44.843]  Tap on this!
[02:48:47.085 --> 02:48:48.726]  Labeling him a menace.
[02:48:49.946 --> 02:48:50.507]  A menace!
[02:48:52.782 --> 02:48:59.684]  For calling Dr. Anthony Fauci a very sinister guy who turned America over to Big Father.
[02:49:00.264 --> 02:49:00.844]  Tapper!
[02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:03.205]  You little tap of crap!
[02:49:04.425 --> 02:49:05.365]  Tap crap!
[02:49:05.925 --> 02:49:06.786]  Tap crap!
[02:49:07.146 --> 02:49:08.946]  Little Anderson Cooper!
[02:49:09.446 --> 02:49:11.227]  Arrogant Andy Cuomo!
[02:49:11.667 --> 02:49:12.107]  Alright!
[02:49:12.687 --> 02:49:14.868]  This is why you have to support the truth!
[02:49:15.368 --> 02:49:17.648]  This is why you have to support InfoWars!
[02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:19.729]  To keep the truth alive!
[02:49:20.865 --> 02:49:27.887]  Again, look what we just told you today, where gold, silver, precious metals are going, inflation, on and on and on, and it's only that much.
[02:49:28.567 --> 02:49:31.628]  Last Trends Journal, 137 pages, no advertisements.
[02:49:32.708 --> 02:49:35.309]  I thought Chris Cuomo was going to die from the virus.
[02:49:35.329 --> 02:49:38.650]  Remember how they played that one up on the Cartoon News Network?
[02:49:38.890 --> 02:49:40.110]  I'm dying, I'm dying.
[02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:43.571]  So thanks for having me on, Alex and InfoWars crew.
[02:49:44.227 --> 02:49:45.208]  Great, great show.
[02:49:45.268 --> 02:49:45.929]  Great job.
[02:49:45.969 --> 02:49:47.070]  Thanks for all that you do.
[02:49:47.471 --> 02:49:50.213]  And remember, everybody, put your money where your heart is.
[02:49:50.253 --> 02:49:55.359]  Keep the truth alive because they're going to rob it from us and they're doing it every second.
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:56.980]  See you next week.
[02:49:57.781 --> 02:49:58.002]  Bye bye.
[02:50:04.434 --> 02:50:05.655]  This is the American dream.
[02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:08.777]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[02:50:08.817 --> 02:50:14.520]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:16.902]  They have so many Americas working for them.
[02:50:17.202 --> 02:50:21.124]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[02:50:21.484 --> 02:50:24.586]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[02:50:24.606 --> 02:50:30.690]  We are funded by you supporting us at Infowarsstore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:35.776]  Hi, I'm Joe Rigg, the Vice President of Sales, and here we are in our main factory here in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[02:50:36.036 --> 02:50:38.439]  As you can see behind me, we have our automatic conveyor systems.
[02:50:38.839 --> 02:50:43.304]  We have all of our finished goods, our racking right here, as well as our manufacturing arm of MyPatriotSupply.
[02:50:43.384 --> 02:50:48.250]  Here out of this facility, we're fulfilling up to 1,400 individual orders just from this facility alone.
[02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:52.473]  So this section right here is where all of our raw goods are brought in from across the country.
[02:50:52.633 --> 02:50:54.174]  All the raw ingredients are brought in here.
[02:50:54.274 --> 02:50:54.934]  It's sourced.
[02:50:55.194 --> 02:50:55.755]  We come here.
[02:50:55.995 --> 02:50:56.975]  We blend it all together.
[02:50:56.995 --> 02:50:57.976]  We put everything together.
[02:50:58.016 --> 02:50:59.237]  We package it and ship it all out.
[02:50:59.277 --> 02:51:01.058]  So all these racks are full of food 24-7.
[02:51:02.639 --> 02:51:03.920]  It's a continuous motion.
[02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:06.281]  It's like a symphony of things coming in and coming out.
[02:51:06.581 --> 02:51:08.503]  It's pretty incredible to watch on a really busy day.
[02:51:08.923 --> 02:51:13.006]  People pulling product down, blending it, packaging it, getting raw products in.
[02:51:13.206 --> 02:51:14.486]  The finished goods out the door.
[02:51:14.566 --> 02:51:15.307]  It's really amazing.
[02:51:15.687 --> 02:51:18.568]  And what's amazing is, again, most of the companies just buy stuff from other companies.
[02:51:18.588 --> 02:51:20.749]  Sometimes it's old, sometimes it's not high quality.
[02:51:20.769 --> 02:51:22.570]  But you guys, you want a long-term relationship.
[02:51:22.610 --> 02:51:23.970]  And I know because I've researched what you do.
[02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:27.772]  This stuff gets tested before it gets here, but you guys go an extra step.
[02:51:27.792 --> 02:51:28.612]  You test it again.
[02:51:28.652 --> 02:51:30.093]  I saw your testing facility.
[02:51:30.373 --> 02:51:33.174]  We test it four or five times before it actually leaves our facility.
[02:51:33.214 --> 02:51:41.617]  So the minute the raws show up, it gets tested before it gets produced, it gets tested during production, it gets tested after production, and it gets tested before it gets put inside of the buckets.
[02:51:41.837 --> 02:51:44.878]  So I just asked Joe to open up a few of these packages for us.
[02:51:45.158 --> 02:51:47.859]  And once he opened it up, he had trouble putting it all back inside.
[02:51:47.899 --> 02:51:49.019]  That's how jam-packed these are.
[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:52.561]  This isn't like a Doritos bag where it's 80% air.
[02:51:52.801 --> 02:51:57.983]  These things are jam-packed with high quality product, with all those great calories for you and your family.
[02:51:58.363 --> 02:52:01.324]  And again, even this packaging is proprietary and really tough.
[02:52:01.344 --> 02:52:01.924]  Tell us about this.
[02:52:02.444 --> 02:52:09.325]  What this packaging is, it's a really thick mylar and one of the things that separates us from some of the other brands is going to be this built-in Ziploc right here.
[02:52:09.725 --> 02:52:12.906]  Let's say for instance you're going to have your maple grove oatmeal but you're not going to eat the whole thing.
[02:52:13.446 --> 02:52:20.147]  Pour out just the proportion that you want to have, Ziploc that, throw that back in the bucket, use it within the next seven to ten days and you're good to go.
[02:52:20.347 --> 02:52:21.107]  And it's not flimsy?
[02:52:21.468 --> 02:52:22.708]  It's definitely not flimsy, no.
[02:52:22.828 --> 02:52:25.328]  You'll find some of these other brands that are super, super thin.
[02:52:25.728 --> 02:52:26.909]  It feels like a burrito sack.
[02:52:27.269 --> 02:52:28.409]  This is super, super durable.
[02:52:28.449 --> 02:52:29.289]  You can't rip that.
[02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.829]  You can't break that.
[02:52:29.869 --> 02:52:30.710]  You can't demolish that.
[02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:31.450]  Your food is protected.
[02:52:32.771 --> 02:52:34.691]  You guys have the best packaging on just the best food.
[02:52:35.032 --> 02:52:35.592]  So look at this.
[02:52:35.952 --> 02:52:37.193]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:52:37.213 --> 02:52:39.874]  This whole thing is just jam-packed product.
[02:52:40.254 --> 02:52:44.636]  But again, if you ever take it out of there, you're going to have to put a whole bunch back in because it's so full.
[02:52:44.656 --> 02:52:45.937]  Right here is a 30-day food supply.
[02:52:45.977 --> 02:52:47.077]  Bucket 1 and Bucket 2.
[02:52:47.417 --> 02:52:49.178]  You got this, you are taken care of.
[02:52:49.638 --> 02:52:54.981]  Whether you're out doing a survival trip or camping or whether the apocalypse comes during the Great Reset,
[02:52:55.661 --> 02:52:58.505]  One person is set with 2,000 calorie meals.
[02:52:58.866 --> 02:53:02.671]  A lot of the competitors aren't just low quality, they're not even close to 2,000 calories.
[02:53:02.991 --> 02:53:04.793]  So this is great for beginners.
[02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:10.040]  Stick your toe in the water at mfulworthstore.com with the one month food supply, bucket one and bucket two.
[02:53:10.421 --> 02:53:11.242]  Everybody should have this.
[02:53:11.542 --> 02:53:14.004]  I'm telling you, everybody needs high-quality, storable foods.
[02:53:14.605 --> 02:53:15.746]  This is the place to get it.
[02:53:16.186 --> 02:53:19.069]  And nobody's got quality anywhere near the price.
[02:53:19.909 --> 02:53:21.250]  And that's why they're my sponsor.
[02:53:21.270 --> 02:53:23.252]  That's why they're going to be my sponsor, hopefully in 10 years.
[02:53:23.512 --> 02:53:25.294]  They've been our sponsor for more than 10 years.
[02:53:25.694 --> 02:53:28.737]  We are so excited to be associated with Ready Hour and myPatreon.
[02:53:28.917 --> 02:53:30.698]  Their entire selection ready to ship to you.
[02:53:31.059 --> 02:53:32.600]  Available at Infoworkstore.com.
[02:53:32.980 --> 02:53:36.323]  By purchasing it there, you help keep us on the air, in the face of globals.
[02:53:36.684 --> 02:53:37.945]  And I again salute you all and thank you.
[02:53:44.534 --> 02:53:49.423]  We're here to deliver you your food, ladies and gentlemen, right here in America, and it funds the InfoWars.
[02:53:49.443 --> 02:53:51.687]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get prepared.
