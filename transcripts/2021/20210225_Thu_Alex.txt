[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.776]  The bottom is dropping out, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get more insane from here.
[00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:09.282]  We have a nation of appeasers and rule followers and order takers.
[00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.938]  Who thinks submitting to all this tyranny will get them ahead.
[00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:15.620]  And it may have gotten you ahead for 50 years selling the country out.
[00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.965]  But now that instinct to stand up for nothing is going to destroy us.
[00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.548]  And that's about as simple as I can put it.
[00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:29.332]  We're going to go over the nuclear codes and why it's so intense and why it's so huge and what it illustrates.
[00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:32.295]  Then we're going to hit the massive next level of censorship.
[00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:36.412]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:04.657]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:06.739]  There is a war on, for your mind.
[00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:10.263]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:14.367]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:18.531]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.795]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:35.974]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:42.081]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:01:42.782 --> 00:01:48.665]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.386]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:54.847]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:58.089]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:10.336]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:13.698]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:18.641]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:31.091]  And the will to be able to face this hard and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:02:33.013 --> 00:02:33.473]  I know why.
[00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:35.074]  Because it's scary.
[00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:43.942]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.264]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:47.245]  You're not going to be able to just
[00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:50.808]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:02:51.988 --> 00:03:15.146]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:21.873]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:23.654]  It should take over your life.
[00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:25.196]  I mean, what else?
[00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:26.737]  What else could it do?
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.390]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open... of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.471]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:52.236]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:03:52.517 --> 00:03:55.579]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.180]  InfoWars.
[00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:00.042]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:14.722]  And ladies and gentlemen that is from more than 10 years ago and I've said we have to lay the groundwork so enough people are aware of this before they launch their final takeover plan.
[00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:29.069]  Well now they've triggered the final takeover plan and it's going to be incremental but it's still going to accelerate from here on out and it will result in first you eating synthetic meat made out of cockroach guts
[00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:30.987]  Drinking sewage.
[00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:32.188]  Eating weeds.
[00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:33.449]  You'll not be allowed to have any other food.
[00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.551]  That's been announced by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.331]  They will enforce it.
[00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:41.496]  Not being able to leave your house unless your digital iPhone or droid says you're authorized to.
[00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:46.380]  Inoculations every month of whatever new DNA splicing system they want.
[00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:49.182]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, February 25th.
[00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:49.463]  The year is 2021.
[00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:21.957]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the Embattled Infowars headquarters in Central Texas.
[00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:27.438]  Well, we knew it was coming.
[00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:43.684]  They were putting in a Skeletor-type reanimated cryptkeeper who can hardly talk and who has clear deep dementia so the bureaucracy could permanently dismantle another sector of the government and get further control.
[00:05:44.983 --> 00:05:49.164]  And of course, I'm talking about the presidency and the executive branch.
[00:05:49.964 --> 00:06:12.791]  And so Nancy Pelosi, who already asked for the nuclear codes to be taken away from Trump just last month on January 8th, is now asking the codes be taken away from Joe Biden, as Trump said right before he left office via fraud when he addressed the Border Patrol down in South Texas and McAllen.
[00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:24.848]  In a suburb of Alamo, he said it will be the 25th Amendment that comes back to haunt Joe Biden, not Donald John Trump.
[00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:35.038]  But this was done by design so that you could have an executive branch that's basically taken over, dissolved into the permanent bureaucracy.
[00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.180]  They've already got most of Congress, they've already got
[00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:39.814]  The Supreme Court to a great extent.
[00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:44.077]  They've already got a lot of the governorships in most of the cities under globalist control.
[00:06:44.157 --> 00:06:54.145]  So now, even powerful alpha male type presidents who are globalists still want to throw their weight around and still want to be in charge.
[00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:55.706]  But they don't want that.
[00:06:55.746 --> 00:07:03.192]  That's why 10 years ago, five years before it happened, Leo Zegami, an amazing reporter on the Vatican,
[00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:20.616]  Big insider, he's on the inside of it, the P2 Lodge, said they're going to have this Jesuit guy, who's now the Pope, and the other Pope won't die, he'll just step down, and because they want to get it, the public used to having like five or six Popes.
[00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:26.617]  They don't want a President, they don't want a Pope, they don't want to, because people tend to be, when they're the head guy, to be the head guy.
[00:07:27.237 --> 00:07:30.238]  They want the bureaucracy behind the scenes to be in total control.
[00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:31.839]  And so,
[00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:56.431]  Just on the face of it, obviously if you go to a committee of Democrats, that's who it is, and the Attorney General and lawyers, if the Russians and the Chinese launch a nuclear weapon, then you're going to absorb that first strike, and so the Mutually Assured Destruction Doctrine that's kept us nuclear war free since the 1950s will be null and void.
[00:07:57.252 --> 00:07:58.813]  This is Nancy Pelosi out there
[00:07:59.907 --> 00:08:05.329]  Reviewing the troops like she's a communist commissar from Red Dawn, strutting up and down.
[00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:15.353]  Oh, she loves guns and tanks and armored vehicles when they're for her power over you, but she doesn't want you to have a semi-automatic shotgun, handgun, or rifle, and has legislation introduced to do just that.
[00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:22.796]  So an incredible letter, and I put a whole report up on this at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:23.516 --> 00:08:27.418]  It's also posted at Banned.Video with the headline, Democrats
[00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.202]  Attempt to take control of the nuclear codes.
[00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:34.984]  Democrats want control of the nuclear codes.
[00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:48.332]  And that just shows you the power frenzy that is taking place inside of our collapsing banana republic.
[00:08:48.412 --> 00:08:53.375]  Pelosi demands Biden transfer nuclear codes to Democrats, is the actual headline.
[00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:55.376]  And I shot that last night and put it out.
[00:08:57.165 --> 00:09:02.833]  Has been just normalized for the public and is beyond dangerous.
[00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:08.761]  There's a lot of facets to that that I break down in the video and I'll be breaking it down more today.
[00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:13.247]  But on the surface, it's like, oh, we don't want you to have first strike capability.
[00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:15.206]  That's
[00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:41.897]  Do you want to give Nancy Pelosi and the folks that have managed the blue cities and the ground, the people that are infiltrated by so many communist Chinese agents, it'll make your head spin?
[00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:45.058]  Do you want them in charge of the nuclear weapons?
[00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:46.819]  Is that what you want?
[00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:52.681]  Because that is indeed where they're going, and I said this over and over again.
[00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:56.603]  If they have a weak Biden who'll just sign whatever they put in front of him,
[00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:02.746]  He can sign away the checks and balances on the border, on the military, on national security.
[00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:03.667]  He's already done it.
[00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:05.449]  Oh, China can be involved in our power grid.
[00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:07.731]  Oh, China can be involved in our colleges again.
[00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:09.372]  The Chinese government that says we shouldn't exist.
[00:10:10.093 --> 00:10:11.354]  Oh, China can have death camps.
[00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:13.737]  China can invade Hong Kong.
[00:10:14.077 --> 00:10:18.501]  This is not a slippery slope to tyranny and capitulation to China.
[00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.463]  We've gone over the edge.
[00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:22.325]  I mean, you have Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:10:24.496 --> 00:10:26.457]  The head of Chinese intelligence tells me what to do.
[00:10:26.517 --> 00:10:28.378]  I met with him and the other guy disappeared.
[00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:31.300]  Oh, the Alabama head.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.702]  And we just don't know what to do.
[00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:37.943]  This is all so incredibly frightening.
[00:10:38.884 --> 00:10:45.227]  This is all, you know, I'm under investigation by the Southern District of New York.
[00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:46.548]  What am I going to do?
[00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:53.331]  And now none of that matters because China can use all that dirt on Biden.
[00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:55.892]  You see, the left's like, oh, well, he's our guy.
[00:10:56.172 --> 00:10:57.273]  Let him be a Chinese agent.
[00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:58.734]  Let Feinstein be a Chinese agent.
[00:10:58.774 --> 00:11:02.296]  Let Eric Swallowswell be a Chinese agent.
[00:11:02.436 --> 00:11:05.677]  All of that is OK because he's our agent.
[00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:10.380]  No, you are a leftist that lives in a Coughlin apartment.
[00:11:11.468 --> 00:11:14.091]  And drives a solar-powered car that doesn't work, if you have one.
[00:11:14.492 --> 00:11:15.573]  You don't know anything.
[00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.454]  You don't run anything.
[00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:20.558]  You're pretending in your Twitter echo chamber that you're part of the power structure.
[00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:24.883]  You're part of nothing, but being a useful idiot, as V.I.
[00:11:24.923 --> 00:11:26.045]  Lennon would call you.
[00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:37.849]  The Communist Chinese are incredibly authoritarian, set up as an authoritarian command base by the globalists in the 70s, 80s, and 90s to take the world over.
[00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.370]  And that's what's happening.
[00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.711]  But the left fetishizes everywhere.
[00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:45.032]  It's sprayed put on the walls in Austin and in Minnesota and New York.
[00:11:45.092 --> 00:11:52.695]  I've seen it with my own eyes and all over the news that Xi Jinping's badass and he's going to crush us and he'll teach the conservatives how to operate.
[00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:54.475]  And man, we've got Xi Jinping.
[00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:55.476]  He'll defeat America.
[00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:11.488]  And here are these fools watching all of our rights and freedoms and our dollar and our military swept away and now the nuclear weapons in the control, or they get their way, of the completely compromised Democrat Congress.
[00:12:11.508 --> 00:12:14.771]  But don't forget Mitch McConnell's wife on the Chinese government payroll.
[00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:25.098]  And Mitch McConnell has come out and said he will approve Merrick Garland, one of the votes they need in the Senate, who says he wants to confiscate guns and says Antifa is not bad.
[00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:31.599]  So the bottom is dropping out, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get more insane from here.
[00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:36.081]  We have a nation of appeasers and rule followers and order takers.
[00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:39.743]  Who thinks submitting to all this tyranny will get them ahead.
[00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:42.445]  And it may have gotten you ahead for 50 years selling the country out.
[00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:47.788]  But now that instinct to stand up for nothing is going to destroy us.
[00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:51.350]  And that's about as simple as I can put it.
[00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.133]  We're going to go over the nuclear codes and why it's so intense and why it's so huge and what it illustrates.
[00:12:56.573 --> 00:12:59.095]  Then we're going to hit the massive next level of censorship.
[00:12:59.977 --> 00:13:00.217]  Thank you.
[00:13:18.775 --> 00:13:20.717]  And several guests as well today.

[00:14:53.776 --> 00:15:01.967]  Nancy Pelosi has officially asked the puppet president, Joe Biden, to transfer to her and the Democratic Party, the nuclear launch codes.
[00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:12.764]  It's the 24th of February 2021 on this Wednesday evening.
[00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:17.374]  I was about to pack up and go home to see my wife and family and
[00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:25.960]  I saw the news story and couldn't believe it, so I went to the Congressional website, I checked the signatures, I checked the Twitter accounts, and it's true.
[00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:44.313]  Nancy Pelosi, through her surrogates and a long list of members of Congress, has sent a letter to Joe Biden, who will sign anything she puts in front of him, to transfer the nuclear codes to her and a group of Congressmen and women, as well as the Attorney General.
[00:15:45.014 --> 00:15:47.696]  Now, obviously, if Russia or China launch a nuclear attack,
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:16:06.556]  It's the President, the Executive Branch, the Constitution that has the power and the responsibility to defend against that and you can't have a long deliberative process of going to Congress and going to the Attorney General and getting this whole laundry list of people to sign off on whether it's legal.
[00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:11.800]  We don't elect the Attorney General of the United States to say if launching a nuclear attack is legal.
[00:16:12.461 --> 00:16:15.906]  We elect a commander-in-chief to be over the military, and that's who decides that.
[00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:19.250]  If we're going to have a declaration of war and go to war with the country, that's Congress.
[00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:30.064]  But in an emergency capacity, if America has been attacked, that's the modern world, it is the policy of this country and other countries that the chief executive of the armed forces deal with that threat.
[00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:35.208]  To follow this would be to invite a first strike by Russia or China.
[00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:48.695]  So to have Pelosi doing this after five, six years, before Trump even got elected, of saying he is a Russian agent for five years at least, we've been hearing this, and then to see them do something like this is just incredibly dangerous.
[00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:53.298]  You've got to read the letter that a whole list of members of Congress signed on to.
[00:16:54.018 --> 00:16:56.480]  The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the leader of the Senate,
[00:16:57.557 --> 00:17:00.298]  Chuckie Schumer have not hidden the fact that they are the ones behind this.
[00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:13.725]  In fact, back on January 8th, last month, before Trump was already gone from office via their election fraud, they went to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had a conversation about taking the nuclear codes away from the President.
[00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:21.169]  So you can call Trump a dictator all day, you can call Biden a dictator all day, but if you transfer military operations to Congress,
[00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.070]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.694]  It's insanely dangerous because then you can't respond to an outside foreign threat.
[00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.375]  This is simply amazing.
[00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.116]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:42.427]  It says right here on the second page that a consortium of bureaucrats and lawyers will be in control and that the Attorney General will confirm whether it's legal or not.
[00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:47.296]  Well, how does the Attorney General know international law or the rules of war or U.S.
[00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:48.596]  nuclear engagement policy?
[00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:57.883]  This is a true coup over the executive branch, over our military, and over 250 plus years of this nation's existence.
[00:17:58.323 --> 00:18:01.325]  No one on the planet, from France to the U.K.
[00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:02.385]  to Russia to China,
[00:18:03.326 --> 00:18:13.337]  to Israel has their Congress or their Knesset or their Parliament in control of the deployment of nuclear weapons or any other weapons.
[00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:17.528]  But this is the bureaucratic lawyer desire for power.
[00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:32.416]  And we know that Communist China, working through their agents like Eric Swallowswell, who's been penetrated by literal sex operatives, are the ones that ran the second impeachment, and are the ones that have been threatening to use nuclear weapons on American gun owners, and we don't submit to them.
[00:18:32.956 --> 00:18:39.120]  So this is clearly China trying to use their operatives like Joe Biden, who has said, hey,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.621]  I am more than happy to let China invade Hong Kong.
[00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:44.722]  I'm more than happy to have China have death camps.
[00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:47.704]  And so they know that he and his son are totally compromised.
[00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:53.807]  And now they're going to use congressional pressure to have them come to Biden and start transferring the power illegally to them.
[00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.808]  So Biden must be removed.
[00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:57.548]  Pelosi must be removed.
[00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:02.410]  This just shows what allowing this bureaucratic coup has done, what the election fraud has allowed.
[00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.250]  Now they say their main mission is war with American gun owners.
[00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.611]  Now they say they want a civil war to re-educate us.
[00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:10.732]  And they're literally on the tit of the Communist Chinese.
[00:19:11.152 --> 00:19:13.432]  Hollywood's literally owned by the Communist Chinese.
[00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:19.594]  And so many members of Congress from Dianne Feinstein to Swalwell are on their payroll.
[00:19:20.214 --> 00:19:34.549]  And this is now the point we've gotten to where the Attorney General and the Secretary of State and the Vice President and the Speaker of the House and a panel of members of the House and Senate will decide when we use nuclear weapons.
[00:19:35.936 --> 00:19:36.756]  It's just incredible.
[00:19:37.537 --> 00:19:39.318]  It's so mind-blowing.
[00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:42.619]  But, again, the globalists don't like us having a country.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.843]  They don't like having a House, a Senate, which is a legislative branch, the judicial, the courts, or the executive.
[00:19:49.283 --> 00:20:00.529]  They want control of it all through these bureaucracies, through things like Enron, these corporate management boards that actually make the decisions, and then legislative bodies become vestigial.
[00:20:00.889 --> 00:20:03.370]  We already let Congress insider trade outside the law.
[00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.351]  We already let them
[00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:06.553]  Surveillance outside the law.
[00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:09.936]  We already let them engage in so many crimes it's mind-boggling.
[00:20:10.317 --> 00:20:17.925]  It's not enough now to ship our jobs to Communist China and to have the Clintons give them our missile secrets and ICBM secrets and nuclear weapons secrets under the Clintons.
[00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:24.756]  Now, they're trying to hobble us further, where the executive branch doesn't even have control of the nuclear weapons.
[00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:27.917]  But that makes sense, because Biden is a hand puppet.
[00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:32.399]  He is a puppet of the Communist Chinese, so this is the logical extension.
[00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:41.642]  He's only been in office a month and a few days, and already they're trying to transfer the nuclear weapons over to a group of Democrat Party bureaucrats.
[00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:47.584]  I mean, really, the headline here is, Nancy Pelosi asked Biden
[00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:51.066]  To put nuclear weapons under control of the Democratic Party.
[00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:52.290]  Because that's what this is.
[00:20:53.228 --> 00:20:56.771]  Merrick Garland and Nancy Pelosi and all the rest of them.
[00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:59.173]  So if America puts up with this, we deserve what we get.
[00:20:59.573 --> 00:21:03.937]  There's this belief that, oh, America's invincible and America's too big to fail.
[00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:14.886]  But the very people running America are running into the ground and don't want it to exist and have been groomed for decades to serve foreign powers and foreign banks and foreign corporations.
[00:21:14.926 --> 00:21:18.469]  So I'm just going to ask the left, you really want the nuclear weapons?
[00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:22.259]  In control of the corrupt Attorney General.
[00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.320]  The new Attorney General coming in.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.841]  And the answer is, of course you do.
[00:21:25.261 --> 00:21:27.343]  You have a sycophantic love affair with tyranny.
[00:21:27.883 --> 00:21:29.865]  You have a sycophantic love affair with corruption.
[00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:32.006]  And lawyers run this country.
[00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:32.887]  They've run it in the ground.
[00:21:33.287 --> 00:21:36.330]  And so now they're going to play general and be in control of the nuclear weapons.
[00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.612]  I'll be covering this all tomorrow on my weekday show, 11 a.m.
[00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:40.253]  to 3 p.m.
[00:21:40.793 --> 00:21:47.258]  There's also Washington Journal weekday mornings with Tom Papert and Harrison Smith and, of course, Owen Schroer with The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:21:47.478 --> 00:21:48.639]  I don't know how long we're going to be on air.
[00:21:49.707 --> 00:21:52.309]  And that is a report, again, I filed last night.
[00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:56.912]  I would like to now give the number out and take your calls for the next hour.
[00:21:57.832 --> 00:22:01.495]  The next half hour, the first half hour, the next hour, then Tom Papert's got big breaking news.
[00:22:01.995 --> 00:22:04.216]  National File helped expose the whistleblowers.
[00:22:06.018 --> 00:22:10.360]  AT&T working with Huawei and the Communist Chinese to basically take over the U.S.
[00:22:11.181 --> 00:22:13.783]  We broke that with Papert two days ago when he hosted
[00:22:14.878 --> 00:22:20.641]  The Morning Show, National File, and that was covered by Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:24.323]  We're really proud of the great work that the folks at National File do.
[00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:27.325]  They're just amazing people and we're glad to work with them.
[00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:30.347]  AT&T doubles down on working with CCP, confirms everything.
[00:22:30.687 --> 00:22:32.288]  Tucker Carlson, National File reported.
[00:22:32.948 --> 00:22:36.110]  This is the sellout of the country to authoritarianism.
[00:22:37.449 --> 00:22:43.373]  And they can use executive power to commit massive crimes, claiming that the executive has that power to do that unless they're impeached.
[00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:48.396]  And then all these people that commit these crimes believe they will not go to prison, no matter what happens in the future.
[00:22:49.176 --> 00:22:52.358]  So Trump was four years of holding him off partially.
[00:22:52.898 --> 00:22:54.739]  Now we have gone off the deep end.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.101]  Toll-free number to join us on air today is 877-789-2539.
[00:22:57.121 --> 00:22:57.161]  877-789-2539.
[00:23:03.584 --> 00:23:15.387]  Let's do first-time callers in the first round, and it's specifically on the Democrats wanting the nuclear launch codes and moving towards 25th Amendment with Biden.
[00:23:15.747 --> 00:23:24.369]  That shows they put him in there as a placeholder the whole time, so they can blame him for a bunch of crimes they commit, then put a new puppet in, and then continue following through on that policy.
[00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:25.549]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:23:31.155 --> 00:23:41.778]  The most forbidden, remote, attacked, censored, lied about broadcast in the world is The Alex Jones Show and Infowars.
[00:23:42.678 --> 00:23:43.658]  And for a good reason.
[00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:46.779]  We study the globalists and their actual plans.
[00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:52.001]  We know how to stop them and that scares the living daylights out of them.
[00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:58.022]  And there's a term they have for literature and movies that get better with time or are timeless.
[00:23:58.863 --> 00:24:00.223]  They're called evergreen.
[00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:15.831]  And when they took down our five big YouTube channels with over 5 billion views total, they destroyed over 60,000 videos that we had posted in the 12 or 13 years that YouTube had existed when that happened three years ago.
[00:24:17.272 --> 00:24:29.923]  But somehow listeners have gone to their old computers or into their VHS tapes or DVDs where they burned these shows, where they saved them, burned them on the disc, not burned them like book burning.
[00:24:31.112 --> 00:24:32.213]  Like Amazon's now doing.
[00:24:33.954 --> 00:24:37.056]  And people are going and watching it, and they're really getting freaked out.
[00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:41.859]  Because it's one thing for me to make claims 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.204]  It's another thing to see it happen, because this stuff was fantastical sounding back then, but very entertaining.
[00:24:50.725 --> 00:24:54.527]  Like Harry Shearer said, Alex Jones is an amazing science fiction writer.
[00:24:55.888 --> 00:24:59.771]  No, Harry, I was reading the Rockefeller documents and the UN documents.
[00:25:01.803 --> 00:25:04.344]  How they would end the biological sexes by 2020-30?
[00:25:04.404 --> 00:25:08.745]  With chemicals in the water?
[00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:10.826]  And now you see the numbers coming out?
[00:25:10.846 --> 00:25:12.066]  I'm going to cover it here in a moment.
[00:25:12.507 --> 00:25:15.147]  Have you guys given that New York Times article again, What's Happening to the Sperm?
[00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:15.628]  Thanks.
[00:25:16.208 --> 00:25:18.268]  But let me go ahead and show you this stack, then we're going to go to your calls.
[00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:20.489]  Here's a quote from George Washington.
[00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:28.852]  If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep
[00:25:31.192 --> 00:25:31.693]  The slaughter.
[00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:34.417]  Here's the big story.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:46.815]  On InfoWars.com, Twitter says, and this is official, it purged dozens of accounts for undermining faith
[00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:49.009]  Yes, we are.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.101]  Similar to the CFR.
[00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:09.162]  It's all the same group.
[00:26:09.202 --> 00:26:17.668]  People that are in the Trilateral Commission, or in the CFR, or in the Atlantic Council, and it's got multinational group on these boards, and they've got incredible power.
[00:26:17.688 --> 00:26:20.350]  It's the Atlantic Council that's quarterbacked a lot of the censorship.
[00:26:22.271 --> 00:26:24.993]  Like they said three years ago, they said, oh, don't worry, we're gonna get the liberals next.
[00:26:25.013 --> 00:26:26.054]  We're gonna take all their speech too.
[00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:29.797]  So continuing,
[00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:32.498]  Glenn Greenwald put out this tweet.
[00:26:33.139 --> 00:26:45.281]  It took only two years to go from disappearing Milo and Alex Jones to banning content said to amplify narratives that undermine faith in NATO.
[00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:47.542]  Not allowed to do that.
[00:26:48.122 --> 00:26:50.243]  Imagine where the line will be in two years from now.
[00:26:50.783 --> 00:26:56.004]  Censorship is an intoxicating power that endlessly expands until it is smashed.
[00:26:58.405 --> 00:26:59.805]  Another RT article.
[00:27:01.013 --> 00:27:05.856]  It's not a defense of Alex Jones to argue that we're on a slippery slope to internet censorship.
[00:27:07.497 --> 00:27:10.779]  And they always talk about the strawman attacks on me that are never accurate.
[00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:14.062]  And then now this article.
[00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:15.835]  Out of red state.
[00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:23.682]  The bevy of books made me buy buy Amazon Institute's moratorium on hate speech for written works.
[00:27:24.323 --> 00:27:27.026]  Scientific works about COVID-19 being an overblown hoax.
[00:27:27.806 --> 00:27:33.372]  Scientific works about the whole transgender movement being a worldwide sterilization plan.
[00:27:33.872 --> 00:27:35.594]  Hatched by the Tabistock Institute in the UN.
[00:27:36.115 --> 00:27:38.457]  All of that is banned.
[00:27:42.797 --> 00:27:47.100]  And Sagar Injati has a good way of laying it out on Twitter.
[00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:07.734]  And that's exactly what this is.
[00:28:07.794 --> 00:28:08.814]  It's exponential.
[00:28:08.914 --> 00:28:11.075]  It's logarithmic.
[00:28:11.755 --> 00:28:12.656]  Like an earthquake.
[00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:19.219]  A one on a Ripper scale is an order of magnitude bigger once it's a two.
[00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:23.881]  And then it goes up from there.
[00:28:27.363 --> 00:28:33.346]  And that leads us to this little gem from Paul Joseph Watson on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:41.474]  Facebook algorithm accuses 81-year-old grandmother of hate speech over knitted pigs comment.
[00:28:42.773 --> 00:28:43.694]  People don't even know what that means.
[00:28:43.714 --> 00:28:45.115]  It's like an old English term.
[00:28:45.755 --> 00:28:52.720]  Facebook algorithm flagged a one-year-old grandmother's comments about knitted pigs as an example of hate speech and threatened her with permanent ban.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:29:07.750]  Yes, really, after losing her husband last year, Rita Richie McClatchy, a retired teacher who lives in Australia, created a Facebook page to share with the world her love of knitting and raised money for the Smith family charity, which helps disadvantaged children.
[00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.612]  After posting a picture of her own knitted pigs,
[00:29:12.062 --> 00:29:22.065]  Richie McClatchy referred to them as white pigs and high zigs pigs resulting in the threat to terminate or account over hate speech just for saying what color they were.
[00:29:23.426 --> 00:29:24.526]  And it's all mind control.
[00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:29.708]  It's about attacking language where you're superstitious and scared of all language.
[00:29:29.828 --> 00:29:31.288]  And that leads us next hour.
[00:29:31.308 --> 00:29:37.550]  I'm going to play that Coca-Cola training video where they teach you that being white is inherently bad.
[00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.711]  You must eradicate it and become less white.
[00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:42.702]  There's no bottom to that.
[00:29:42.742 --> 00:29:45.544]  They're teaching school children, only see color.
[00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:47.726]  Do not be color blind.
[00:29:49.267 --> 00:29:59.515]  So if you make some pink pigs and you make some polka dotted pigs, you are a racist when you do it to raise money for disadvantaged children or brain damaged children.
[00:30:01.276 --> 00:30:02.938]  I'm sure she'll apologize and behave herself.
[00:30:02.998 --> 00:30:09.603]  Now let's move to this next piece of shock footage that Dan Dix
[00:30:11.204 --> 00:30:12.244]  Great reporter and filmmaker.
[00:30:12.264 --> 00:30:13.205]  He's been on the show many times.
[00:30:13.665 --> 00:30:16.646]  Caught up in Canada, where they have endless lockdowns.
[00:30:16.666 --> 00:30:17.687]  They have protests against it.
[00:30:17.747 --> 00:30:24.910]  So, a group of men thug out and viciously tackle and viciously choke out.
[00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.530]  And it's just like George Floyd.
[00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:27.811]  He can't breathe.
[00:30:29.652 --> 00:30:31.772]  But when the cops beat up a white guy, it's okay.
[00:30:31.832 --> 00:30:32.393]  Or a black guy.
[00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:34.473]  We got all the footage of black guys not wearing masks in New York.
[00:30:34.573 --> 00:30:37.975]  And man, the cops are just savagely beating them and choking them out.
[00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:40.496]  And everybody's like, you're heroes!
[00:30:43.612 --> 00:30:44.892]  Yeah, let's MMA this guy!
[00:30:44.912 --> 00:30:45.612]  Hell, let's kill him!
[00:30:45.632 --> 00:30:46.413]  Let's break his neck!
[00:30:46.913 --> 00:30:47.753]  Hell, they'd have killed him!
[00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:51.133]  Like Ashley Babbitt, they would have said it was an assault!
[00:30:52.254 --> 00:30:53.474]  Worse than World War II!
[00:30:53.594 --> 00:30:55.954]  And that they were all, you know, victims.
[00:30:55.974 --> 00:30:57.655]  They'd have broke his neck, but they hurt him really bad.
[00:30:58.475 --> 00:31:01.435]  And this is just the system totally thugging out.
[00:31:02.175 --> 00:31:10.137]  And the very people that launched the attacks, the very people that launched the COVID system, the UN, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, they're the ones up there.
[00:31:11.571 --> 00:31:13.732]  Directing all of us how we should behave, what we should do.
[00:31:13.752 --> 00:31:15.092]  We're going to go to break and come back with that.

[00:33:15.065 --> 00:33:16.246]  China subjected U.S.
[00:33:16.266 --> 00:33:19.228]  diplomats to anal coronavirus test.
[00:33:19.688 --> 00:33:20.308]  And the U.S.
[00:33:20.328 --> 00:33:25.431]  says they're getting ready to adopt it to make you submit to your body being penetrated.
[00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:30.813]  Well, your body belongs to the state and belongs to your daddy, Bill Gates.
[00:33:32.634 --> 00:33:33.154]  Unbelievable.
[00:33:33.194 --> 00:33:33.934]  That's all coming up.
[00:33:33.974 --> 00:33:35.035]  But here is the footage.
[00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:37.136]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:42.778]  A man without mask, assaulted, tackled by masked Nazis in Canada.
[00:33:43.598 --> 00:33:44.819]  He's in a tire store.
[00:33:45.973 --> 00:33:49.874]  And the men just come up, beat the hell out of him, start choking him, trying to kill him.
[00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:52.175]  Because they're heroes!
[00:33:52.795 --> 00:33:53.015]  Why?
[00:33:53.055 --> 00:33:59.017]  Because, you know, there's death everywhere, and everybody's got to quarantine forever, and... They're heroes.
[00:34:01.138 --> 00:34:06.460]  This is how fascism works, this is how communism works, this is how Maoism works, is they get all these useful idiot morons.
[00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:09.010]  Go out and do this.
[00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.491]  In fact, now people are getting COVID tattoos with the serial numbers of the vaccine they got.
[00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:14.751]  Very proud to show it off.
[00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:15.871]  Hey, dumbasses!
[00:34:16.151 --> 00:34:17.472]  Hey, dipshits!
[00:34:18.092 --> 00:34:19.732]  Got some news for you, dummies!
[00:34:21.772 --> 00:34:23.513]  They're saying, oh, you still gotta wear a mask.
[00:34:23.693 --> 00:34:24.893]  You still gotta social distance.
[00:34:24.953 --> 00:34:25.953]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[00:34:26.173 --> 00:34:27.473]  There'll be vaccines every month.
[00:34:27.773 --> 00:34:28.513]  It never ends.
[00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:29.574]  Because you're schmucks.
[00:34:29.794 --> 00:34:31.054]  Because you buy into the lie.
[00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:37.095]  Because you get off on how you're a hero when you do the mass psychology.
[00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:49.153]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the physical violent assault by five low-grade morons that literally try to kill this guy.
[00:34:49.213 --> 00:34:49.554]  Here it is.
[00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:54.046]  You are going to remove your hands from my f***ing purse.
[00:34:54.106 --> 00:34:55.246]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:34:55.266 --> 00:34:56.006]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:34:56.026 --> 00:34:57.146]  Get your f***ing hands off me!

[00:35:01.468 --> 00:35:02.208]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:02.228 --> 00:35:03.128]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:03.148 --> 00:35:03.888]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:03.908 --> 00:35:04.949]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:06.029]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:07.409]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:08.750]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.510]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.310]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.911]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:14.331]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:14.371 --> 00:35:15.272]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:16.112]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:17.112]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:17.132 --> 00:35:18.113]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:18.953]  Get your f***ing hands off me!
[00:35:18.973 --> 00:35:19.293]  Get your f
[00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:28.830]  This is so widespread that Dan Dix is even trying to catch this incident.
[00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.872]  Look at him, on the ground, choking you.
[00:35:30.892 --> 00:35:32.933]  Kill somebody easy like that.
[00:35:32.953 --> 00:35:33.714]  Get that terrorist!
[00:35:33.754 --> 00:35:34.334]  Kill him!
[00:35:34.354 --> 00:35:34.574]  Get him!
[00:35:48.985 --> 00:35:51.066]  Get him!
[00:35:51.086 --> 00:35:53.367]  He's a terrorist!
[00:35:54.747 --> 00:35:59.149]  You notice they're not social distancing.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:02.310]  You're gonna wear the mask or we're gonna kill you.
[00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:03.410]  Of course you can't breathe.
[00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.711]  We're gonna put poison in you and kill you.
[00:36:05.771 --> 00:36:06.071]  We're liberals!
[00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:07.772]  Back it up 30 seconds.
[00:36:07.792 --> 00:36:08.712]  Back it up 30 seconds.
[00:36:09.112 --> 00:36:09.752]  Hit pause for me.
[00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:16.921]  On the video, back it up 30 seconds, thanks.
[00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.222]  Because I don't want to talk over it.
[00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:22.366]  I want you to hear him begging for his life as they choke him and bend his arms behind his back.
[00:36:22.646 --> 00:36:28.092]  A bunch of moron thugs that watch MMA all day and think that they're Brock Lesnar.
[00:36:32.797 --> 00:36:33.777]  I'm trying to choke him.
[00:36:33.838 --> 00:36:35.599]  How do I make him pass out?
[00:36:35.779 --> 00:36:37.822]  If I can come back from that score, I'll tell you that.
[00:36:40.353 --> 00:36:42.115]  Let's do the hello.
[00:36:42.335 --> 00:36:43.236]  They're heroes.
[00:37:11.724 --> 00:37:14.066]  You cannot do this to me!
[00:37:14.646 --> 00:37:15.967]  Get your hands off me!
[00:37:17.748 --> 00:37:18.489]  Stop it!
[00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:20.871]  Why are you doing this to me?
[00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:21.151]  Stop it!
[00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:21.731]  Stop it!
[00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:22.712]  Stop it!
[00:37:22.772 --> 00:37:22.952]  Stop!
[00:37:23.332 --> 00:37:23.873]  I know!
[00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:24.873]  You're crazy!
[00:37:24.913 --> 00:37:25.774]  Oh, he's not!
[00:37:25.854 --> 00:37:26.895]  You're crazy!
[00:37:27.875 --> 00:37:28.516]  Stop this!
[00:37:28.536 --> 00:37:30.237]  Stop this!
[00:37:42.204 --> 00:37:43.345]  Yes, no one's choking you.
[00:37:43.405 --> 00:37:44.447]  No one's assaulting you.
[00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:45.788]  No one's breaking your arms.
[00:37:45.808 --> 00:37:49.472]  We're all heroes.
[00:37:49.532 --> 00:37:56.300]  Of course, then they call the police after they zip tie him like he's done something wrong.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.201]  We're all heroes, though.
[00:38:00.908 --> 00:38:02.429]  It's Canadian Tire, folks.
[00:38:02.509 --> 00:38:07.413]  If you are into tyranny and into being physically assaulted, well, that's the place for you.
[00:38:07.454 --> 00:38:08.675]  They're all a bunch of heroes there.
[00:38:08.695 --> 00:38:11.597]  And if you read the article, it's really important you should share it.
[00:38:12.898 --> 00:38:15.840]  We show the British government and other governments saying masks don't protect you.
[00:38:16.241 --> 00:38:17.962]  They're not associated with decreased risk.
[00:38:18.022 --> 00:38:20.544]  They are nothing but a symbol that we're dirty and bad.
[00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.906]  We've got all the statistics right here for you.
[00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:23.747]  But they don't care.
[00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:25.709]  Because they're heroes.
[00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:28.105]  Meanwhile, D.C.
[00:38:28.225 --> 00:38:35.210]  elites call cops on truck with Don't Tread On Me plates, fearing it may be an insurrectionist vehicle and the police go after them.
[00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:41.115]  Pro-Trump terrorists trampled to death in U.S.
[00:38:41.155 --> 00:38:43.657]  Capitol was carrying Don't Tread On Me flag.
[00:38:45.278 --> 00:38:51.623]  And that's the big news by the mother of the police officer that died of a stroke days later.
[00:38:51.924 --> 00:38:53.305]  She said, my son was not attacked.
[00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:55.687]  I don't want his memory being used in a lie.
[00:38:58.186 --> 00:39:02.368]  His mother has come out and said that it's not true that her son's being used for political reasons.
[00:39:02.648 --> 00:39:05.390]  He didn't get attacked, he didn't get hit in the head with a fire extinguisher.
[00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.611]  But they don't care now!
[00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:08.992]  It was the most deadly attack in U.S.
[00:39:09.012 --> 00:39:10.333]  history, worse than Pearl Harbor and 9-11.
[00:39:10.353 --> 00:39:14.995]  According to Chuck Schumer, because four citizens got killed.
[00:39:16.616 --> 00:39:18.397]  A woman got shot in the neck and died.
[00:39:18.777 --> 00:39:21.318]  And so Chuckie Schumer needs your guns.
[00:39:22.199 --> 00:39:22.859]  Look at the footage.
[00:39:22.899 --> 00:39:25.441]  The most deadly attack in U.S.
[00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:25.781]  history.
[00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.774]  I'm told that old lady with the flag didn't even touch anybody.
[00:39:30.814 --> 00:39:32.756]  I'm told they're going to indict her, I guess.
[00:39:33.717 --> 00:39:34.697]  So that's how it all works.
[00:39:34.738 --> 00:39:37.700]  The hero FBI, though, they'll save us, won't they?
[00:39:39.162 --> 00:39:43.146]  But oh, when George Floyd gets choked, it's terrible, which I didn't like it.
[00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:43.626]  It was terrible.
[00:39:43.847 --> 00:39:46.850]  But oh, when somebody else does, because you're not wearing a mask, it's heroic.
[00:39:48.632 --> 00:39:50.212]  All right, we have Aaron in Florida.
[00:39:50.232 --> 00:39:51.513]  I'm going to start with Aaron.
[00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:52.493]  I'm going to go to the next hour.
[00:39:52.853 --> 00:39:56.794]  I asked the question, what do you think of the letter Pelosi already asked for the new codes from Trump?
[00:39:56.834 --> 00:39:59.695]  She says she should have it, not the executive branches in the Constitution.
[00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:02.015]  But now the Democrats just want the launch codes.
[00:40:02.055 --> 00:40:04.116]  They say that Biden can't be trusted with them.
[00:40:04.136 --> 00:40:07.577]  So right away, the 25th Amendment is unfolding here.
[00:40:07.617 --> 00:40:09.497]  Here's a letter for TV viewers that want to see it.
[00:40:09.958 --> 00:40:10.918]  It says the Attorney General
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.222]  I guess as a general now, he will decide.
[00:40:14.402 --> 00:40:16.343]  I mean, not a military general, we don't want that either.
[00:40:16.663 --> 00:40:22.667]  It's the Commander-in-Chief that's elected that does that in an emergency, or if missiles have been fired, they want to tie our hands so we can't do that.
[00:40:23.268 --> 00:40:28.211]  Let's go ahead and go to Aaron, who was a nuclear missile technician for the Navy.
[00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:29.952]  Aaron, what is your view on this?
[00:40:29.972 --> 00:40:35.836]  Okay, try it again.
[00:40:36.197 --> 00:40:37.678]  We're going to Aaron in Florida.
[00:40:37.778 --> 00:40:38.518]  Aaron, can you hear me?
[00:40:39.319 --> 00:40:39.979]  Yes, sir, I'm here.
[00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:40.880]  Go ahead, please.
[00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.330]  Thank you.
[00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.611]  I'm just concerned about this group of dangerous events all coming together.
[00:40:47.892 --> 00:40:54.774]  The new code transition effectively removes our entire nuclear deterrent from being able to defend us or protect us.
[00:40:54.814 --> 00:40:58.115]  Did I articulate it correctly?
[00:40:58.195 --> 00:41:03.936]  Or if not, explain to us what's saying that we have to have a committee of people meet before we can defend ourselves.
[00:41:04.216 --> 00:41:05.917]  Doesn't that invite a nuclear first strike?
[00:41:06.886 --> 00:41:07.706]  Absolutely it does.
[00:41:07.726 --> 00:41:08.967]  You cannot respond quickly.
[00:41:09.027 --> 00:41:10.027]  You've got 11 minutes.
[00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:17.350]  Well, I shouldn't probably say that, but anyways, you've got a very short period of time to respond to any incoming attack.
[00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:33.796]  So that, along with the Secretary of Defense doing a 60-day stand-down for white supremacy review, in conjunction with Chinese military training in Canada for winter ops, and Central America for jungle ops, and having a beachhead in Los Angeles, I believe we're being set up for a coordinated attack.
[00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:40.793]  I told the crew during the power outage, I said, my gut level is we're being set up for a sneak attack, and my gut's never wrong.
[00:41:40.813 --> 00:41:42.393]  I've been having nightmares about it, brother.
[00:41:42.413 --> 00:41:47.014]  I just, all I can say is be ready.
[00:41:48.135 --> 00:41:56.417]  Well, explain to people about Mutually Assured Destruction, how it's actually worked, since the nightmare of nuclear weapons was developed, because we were in a race with the Germans to develop it in World War II.
[00:41:56.817 --> 00:42:03.579]  Explain to people how this works, if they needed to go to Congress, the Attorney General, and have a big powwow, and half these Congress people are Chinese agents.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.941]  Well, it cannot happen like that.
[00:42:07.001 --> 00:42:11.983]  I mean, you know, if you start taking an incoming fire, like I said, you've got very limited time.
[00:42:12.103 --> 00:42:18.085]  And to try to get a group of people to have a concurrence on any event, especially
[00:42:19.093 --> 00:42:19.613]  Libtards?
[00:42:20.254 --> 00:42:21.794]  I mean, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:42:22.535 --> 00:42:26.677]  Well, plus, you can't have the Attorney General without their jurisdiction.
[00:42:26.697 --> 00:42:27.738]  They're not above the President.
[00:42:28.218 --> 00:42:29.498]  And that's the separation of powers.
[00:42:29.678 --> 00:42:32.000]  I mean, since George Washington, that's the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:37.322]  So this is Congress really encroaching on the executive and our security, and it shows what power grabbers they are.
[00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:40.044]  Just like you said, it is an actual coup.
[00:42:40.084 --> 00:42:40.924]  They are taking over.
[00:42:41.004 --> 00:42:42.205]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:42:42.865 --> 00:42:48.088]  And somebody, somewhere, something, and us, all of us together, has got to do something to stop this.
[00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:53.733]  Or you might as well go ahead and raise the red Chinese flag on every flagpole in the United States.
[00:42:56.156 --> 00:43:01.202]  Sir, I totally agree with you 100% and again, America thinks we're invincible.
[00:43:01.502 --> 00:43:05.567]  We're not invincible if we have been infiltrated from within.
[00:43:05.587 --> 00:43:07.129]  It's just that simple.
[00:43:10.228 --> 00:43:12.429]  The electrical meters on your house are made in China.
[00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.969]  Guess what?
[00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:14.709]  They can turn them off with a flick of a switch.
[00:43:15.089 --> 00:43:17.990]  Put the entire nation in absolute grid blackout.
[00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.530]  And that's what Snowden exposed.
[00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:20.470]  Thank you so much.
[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.771]  We are being set up, America, and the average leftist loves it.
[00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:25.391]  They think G.G.
[00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:26.331]  Pink cares about them.
[00:43:26.672 --> 00:43:28.292]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:43:28.352 --> 00:43:28.772]  Stay with us.
[00:43:31.452 --> 00:43:38.074]  Coming up, I got Nancy Pelosi saying she wants tanks with machine guns at the Capitol and that she never wants them to go away.
[00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:39.291]  Whoa!
[00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:42.732]  I just listen to good music.
[00:43:42.752 --> 00:43:43.952]  You know, I'm colorblind like that.
[00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:52.213]  But I'm told by the Democrats and Coca-Cola commercial that's coming up that I'm supposed to only pay attention to what color people are.
[00:43:52.233 --> 00:43:53.254]  That's what's most important.
[00:43:53.734 --> 00:43:57.494]  Not the content of what they do, not the character of their deeds like Martin Luther King said.
[00:43:58.975 --> 00:44:00.235]  They must be the good guys, right?
[00:44:00.295 --> 00:44:03.476]  Coca-Cola and Cartoon Network and Democrats.
[00:44:03.956 --> 00:44:05.176]  But the big story here is
[00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:08.161]  Nuclear doctrine's been figured out.
[00:44:08.221 --> 00:44:09.662]  You gotta have mutually assured destruction.
[00:44:10.142 --> 00:44:13.525]  Somebody fires first, you gotta have early warning, you gotta let them know they're gonna be destroyed as well.
[00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:14.686]  That's why they don't do it.
[00:44:15.327 --> 00:44:20.151]  It's why thieves don't rob a lot of houses, say, in Texas with the lights on, because most folks got guns.
[00:44:20.451 --> 00:44:24.355]  So you got ten times the crime in Chicago or New York, where they know you don't have guns most of the time.
[00:44:25.156 --> 00:44:26.216]  It's called a deterrent.
[00:44:26.988 --> 00:44:30.670]  It's like, why don't you see people assaulting police stations very often?
[00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.452]  Because it's full of men, at least it was in the past, most of them veterans, with guns.
[00:44:36.392 --> 00:44:39.393]  Same reason you don't stick your tally-whacker in a beehive.
[00:44:40.714 --> 00:44:41.414]  Excuse my French.
[00:44:42.615 --> 00:44:46.736]  And so now America is a sitting duck, and I can tell you, Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.
[00:44:46.756 --> 00:44:49.678]  They've already got a consortium of globalists in control of those codes.
[00:44:50.908 --> 00:44:56.630]  My take is I don't know if they're giving the nuclear football to the Democrats or if there's going to be many nuclear footballs.
[00:45:20.268 --> 00:45:27.373]  In which case, there's just more problems as far as security, but also another problem.
[00:45:27.613 --> 00:45:28.934]  Yeah, you know, that's what it is.
[00:45:28.994 --> 00:45:33.477]  It says FEMA will have a bunch of footballs, and then they'll all have to sync up in live time.
[00:45:33.517 --> 00:45:36.378]  It's, it's, it's, the Chi-Coms came up with this for sure.
[00:45:36.398 --> 00:45:37.739]  I mean, this is Chi-Com.
[00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:40.141]  Xi Jinping did this as another loyalty test.
[00:45:40.421 --> 00:45:44.003]  Go on TV and say we can invade Hong Kong and death camps are good.
[00:45:44.404 --> 00:45:46.245]  You can invade Hong Kong, death camps are good.
[00:45:46.505 --> 00:45:48.966]  Now give us the nuclear football, give it to our Chinese agents.
[00:45:49.006 --> 00:45:49.527]  That's it, brother.
[00:45:51.801 --> 00:46:04.642]  Anyway, another thought though, should there be an explosion at the White House, the football would go with the President, and we would be perhaps even more open to problems.
[00:46:06.186 --> 00:46:06.886]  Well, absolutely.
[00:46:06.906 --> 00:46:11.169]  You know, the media makes jokes about the Air Force and everybody with the nuke codes and Marines.
[00:46:12.229 --> 00:46:15.951]  You've got at least a dozen countries with nuclear weapons, five of them aiming weapons at us.
[00:46:15.971 --> 00:46:23.476]  You've got submarines off our coast, satellites in space, and Xi Jinping making jokes about all this and saying they can survive a nuclear war with us.
[00:46:24.016 --> 00:46:29.199]  And then they're like, oh, why does Trump, why does the president need a nuclear launch code with him?
[00:46:29.279 --> 00:46:30.179]  That's warlike.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.062]  Again, it's the fact that we have the weapons is why we haven't been attacked.
[00:46:34.463 --> 00:46:35.543]  I'm sad the weapons are there.
[00:46:35.564 --> 00:46:38.366]  I wish they were never invented, but we're in this world, you know?
[00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:39.787]  Yeah.
[00:46:40.227 --> 00:46:48.134]  Another thought is, I don't know if I believe I heard that the Federal Reserve went down computer-wise.
[00:46:48.834 --> 00:46:51.176]  So somebody hacked the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:51.276 --> 00:46:51.817]  I saw that.
[00:46:51.877 --> 00:46:53.638]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve computer system's down.
[00:46:53.658 --> 00:46:54.299]  That's what I mean.
[00:46:54.339 --> 00:46:55.279]  This whole thing's a mess.
[00:46:56.701 --> 00:47:00.804]  Because somebody did whatever they felt like doing with the Federal Reserve.
[00:47:01.874 --> 00:47:02.617]  We gotta end it.
[00:47:02.938 --> 00:47:06.871]  Remember under Cheney out of Minot, North Dakota and all those missing cruise missiles?
[00:47:09.073 --> 00:47:14.715]  And they also just had a marine weapons or explosive missing.
[00:47:15.175 --> 00:47:15.335]  C4.
[00:47:15.355 --> 00:47:18.176]  Some kind of drill or whatever.
[00:47:18.856 --> 00:47:19.436]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:47:19.456 --> 00:47:22.217]  This country is losing its organization.
[00:47:22.257 --> 00:47:23.557]  It's losing its will.
[00:47:23.897 --> 00:47:25.398]  It's losing its organizational skills.
[00:47:25.458 --> 00:47:27.318]  It's losing its honor.
[00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:32.280]  And we are becoming a banana republic with nuclear weapons very, very quickly with crazy
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.981]  Alzheimer's patient as the president.
[00:47:35.181 --> 00:47:36.521]  Thank you so much, Paul.
[00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:40.663]  But the left thinks that's better to have somebody managing things like that than somebody that actually cared.
[00:47:41.063 --> 00:47:41.923]  So they stole the election.
[00:47:42.463 --> 00:47:44.064]  Back in 60 seconds with more phone calls.
[00:47:44.124 --> 00:47:44.784]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:45.064 --> 00:47:45.444]  Stay with us.
[00:47:47.505 --> 00:47:53.447]  We're now into hour number two on this Thursday, February 25th, 2021 transmission.
[00:47:54.107 --> 00:48:02.470]  Most nationalist, populist, Christian communications, whether it's focused on the family or LifeSite or now even CPAC,
[00:48:03.988 --> 00:48:08.949]  Because they're daring to have Trump speak coming up in just a few days.
[00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:13.790]  They're all being banned off Facebook and Twitter now, and even links that other people promote are being banned.
[00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.251]  You have to understand, we're going into tyranny.
[00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:18.311]  This is a take-up.
[00:48:18.951 --> 00:48:32.394]  This is a multinational consortium that put China in power, gave China one-sided trade deals, built them up to where their GDP is already bigger than ours in reality, and now they're going to put things in place where we cannot do business, and they're cutting our power off.
[00:48:35.737 --> 00:48:39.278]  And so it's, it's, I don't like to sit here and tell you horrible things like this.
[00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:46.741]  I don't like to sit up here and, and say things like this, but that's where we are.
[00:48:50.883 --> 00:48:55.825]  So you can find people to lie to you all day and say, Oh, Q's actually still real.
[00:48:56.445 --> 00:48:58.086]  March 4th, Trump will be inaugurated.
[00:48:58.326 --> 00:49:04.088]  Well, you just hold your breath again and see what happens coming up in nine days.
[00:49:06.616 --> 00:49:09.558]  Or I guess last February short, eight days, seven days.
[00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:13.221]  And people are like, why don't you be positive, Alex?
[00:49:13.281 --> 00:49:18.284]  Well, I can't get up on top of a 50-story building and just jump off on a parachute and say, I've got wings, I'm positive.
[00:49:22.247 --> 00:49:27.931]  Be like the coyote, you know, and he thinks he's got wings and looney tunes, and he falls to the bottom.
[00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:30.653]  It hurts his little head.
[00:49:32.748 --> 00:49:37.111]  So now they wanted the nuclear codes from Trump on January 8th.
[00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:39.232]  The military didn't take them away.
[00:49:39.252 --> 00:49:39.873]  That'd be a coup.
[00:49:41.454 --> 00:49:43.415]  And now Pelosi says, well, I want them again.
[00:49:43.435 --> 00:49:46.177]  I want the attorney general because he's a general, she said.
[00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:50.880]  Not the military, but a general, a lawyer, a really sneaky, evil CHICOM agent.
[00:49:52.335 --> 00:49:52.735]  To have them.
[00:49:53.495 --> 00:49:54.036]  Here's the letter.
[00:49:54.056 --> 00:49:56.457]  A whole bunch of Chinese communist agents.
[00:49:57.037 --> 00:49:58.117]  Swallows well, all of them.
[00:49:58.677 --> 00:49:58.977]  On there.
[00:49:59.818 --> 00:50:00.258]  Here it is.
[00:50:00.318 --> 00:50:01.658]  Even Town Hall has a story on it.
[00:50:01.678 --> 00:50:05.680]  But they kind of spin it like, oh, because they don't trust Biden.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:14.443]  But see, by having an addled, Alzheimer, dementia patient in there, it strengthens the hand of, well, he's got to have people take care of him now.
[00:50:15.083 --> 00:50:15.704]  That's why they did it.
[00:50:15.764 --> 00:50:19.225]  When they want, they can then sell to the highest bidder who the new president's going to be.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.583]  Or he's going to be the new vice president under Kamala and then she can go.
[00:50:24.763 --> 00:50:26.745]  This is the bureaucracy wanting to be president.
[00:50:27.966 --> 00:50:28.707]  Wanting to be generals.
[00:50:30.148 --> 00:50:35.233]  Dozens of Democrats are worried about Biden having singular authority to order use of nuclear weapons.
[00:50:35.273 --> 00:50:38.516]  But if you actually read it, they talk about singular authority for a first strike.
[00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.159]  But they're talking about a strike, period.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.384]  Because they don't count in their definition missiles in the air, cruise missiles in the air.
[00:50:48.949 --> 00:50:54.634]  As the enemy's striking, they want to wait till we're hit and then it would be too late.
[00:50:59.298 --> 00:51:04.762]  Dozens of Democrat lawmakers asked Joe Biden to give up his president's sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.
[00:51:04.782 --> 00:51:05.883]  Well, I thought we elected him.
[00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:07.465]  Well, see, we really didn't elect him.
[00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:09.446]  So see, they're like, hey, he stole the election.
[00:51:09.486 --> 00:51:09.947]  We put him in.
[00:51:10.187 --> 00:51:10.767]  He belongs to us.
[00:51:11.788 --> 00:51:14.671]  Weeks after Nancy Pelosi warned of unhinged, Donald Trump could use them.
[00:51:16.872 --> 00:51:18.598]  Billy confirms below-seat conversation.
[00:51:18.618 --> 00:51:20.505]  This is the Pentagon from talk of disarming Trump.
[00:51:20.986 --> 00:51:21.388]  January 8th.
[00:51:23.902 --> 00:51:26.103]  And it goes on and on.
[00:51:26.123 --> 00:51:27.963]  And then we've got this video.
[00:51:27.983 --> 00:51:29.163]  Go ahead and queue it up.
[00:51:29.744 --> 00:51:30.604]  Remember Pelosi?
[00:51:31.344 --> 00:51:32.364]  It's now been testified.
[00:51:32.744 --> 00:51:35.625]  She wanted machine guns out and loaded.
[00:51:35.665 --> 00:51:43.187]  She's like, why don't these armored vehicles, these hundreds of armored vehicles and hundreds of armored Humvees, why don't they have big machine guns on top?
[00:51:43.207 --> 00:51:45.067]  Like, she's a general now, or a colonel.
[00:51:45.328 --> 00:51:47.048]  She's like strutting around, reviewing the troops.
[00:51:47.068 --> 00:51:48.448]  She's like, where's the weapons?
[00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:50.709]  Well, they're
[00:51:51.843 --> 00:51:53.564]  Magazines are right there in their pouches.
[00:51:54.045 --> 00:51:55.045]  Well, we'll get them out!
[00:51:55.426 --> 00:51:56.667]  Lock and load!
[00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.870]  Yeah, that way somebody has an accident and discharged as a firearm.
[00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:01.791]  We want a war!
[00:52:01.891 --> 00:52:04.032]  And she even said, like, a couple days ago, we want a civil war!
[00:52:04.092 --> 00:52:05.934]  It's time to take it to these Republicans!
[00:52:07.155 --> 00:52:09.636]  Don't let them be at the restaurant or at their church or their house.
[00:52:09.656 --> 00:52:10.537]  Get out there and get them!
[00:52:12.779 --> 00:52:14.700]  Whoever said demonstrations are peaceful?
[00:52:16.321 --> 00:52:19.003]  So we're gonna go to your calls in a moment, but here is Nancy
[00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:28.221]  The Chai Com agent, Pelosi, and her minion, she's related to him, I guess she's in the family, swallows well the Chinese agent.
[00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:33.668]  Here she is talking to a person testifying to Congress about what she wanted.
[00:52:33.688 --> 00:52:33.929]  Here it is.
[00:52:34.622 --> 00:52:46.371]  You know, I mean, you raise a great point because when you think about all of that across the summer, one of the most haunting images to me is the third precinct in Minneapolis when it was basically just, they just moved out of it.
[00:52:46.451 --> 00:52:48.112]  The police moved out of it in the middle of the night.
[00:52:48.152 --> 00:52:49.073]  It was set on fire.
[00:52:49.473 --> 00:52:54.457]  They basically escaped in their squad cars and didn't come back.
[00:52:55.117 --> 00:52:56.899]  And, you know, people were ransacking it.
[00:52:57.159 --> 00:53:01.142]  You know, there was all this discussion about, no, we don't want the National Guard for this instance, right?
[00:53:01.943 --> 00:53:06.426]  There in Seattle and Portland as well, you know, discussion, don't send the National Guard to President Trump.
[00:53:06.787 --> 00:53:12.751]  Now, behind us, you've got a force that is several times the number that we have in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:53:12.771 --> 00:53:13.312]  A division.
[00:53:13.572 --> 00:53:14.233]  Makes sense of that.
[00:53:14.253 --> 00:53:14.473]  A division.
[00:53:14.913 --> 00:53:23.236]  You have a division, and the last up of thousands of these troops was requested by the Speaker through the Capitol Police.
[00:53:23.696 --> 00:53:29.038]  She even wanted crew-manned machine guns in Washington.
[00:53:29.058 --> 00:53:29.978]  That was rejected.
[00:53:30.878 --> 00:53:36.323]  Because there's simply no use for that in a security arrangement for a civilian undertaking.
[00:53:37.564 --> 00:53:53.377]  So some of this has gone beyond any legitimate security need, but they're disciplined, they're professional, and the Secret Service has been choreographing this very effectively to maintain security and safety.
[00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.699]  But you know, China's laughing at us right now.
[00:53:55.879 --> 00:53:57.039]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:53:57.059 --> 00:53:58.020]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.181]  I guess that would be Mike and then James and others.
[00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:07.743]  Mike in California, what's your view on Biden and how the Democrats already want the nuclear codes for themselves?
[00:54:08.063 --> 00:54:09.483]  Pretty big constitutional crisis.
[00:54:09.503 --> 00:54:09.983]  What do you say?
[00:54:11.724 --> 00:54:13.084]  Yeah, I agree, Jones.
[00:54:13.104 --> 00:54:17.665]  And I just want to say I can't imagine Canada would be happy.
[00:54:17.685 --> 00:54:22.467]  You know, they see ICBM coming up over the Arctic and the other countries under our nuclear umbrella.
[00:54:23.334 --> 00:54:25.234]  are probably concerned about this as well.
[00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:29.575]  I just want to say that this is such a bad idea.
[00:54:29.595 --> 00:54:36.837]  You know, the military-industrial complex minions will be the ones who end up, you know, getting control of this.
[00:54:36.897 --> 00:54:39.218]  Same people that killed JFK and carried out 9-11.
[00:54:39.558 --> 00:54:42.878]  Then they'll have leverage over the President and the American people.
[00:54:43.758 --> 00:54:50.420]  And I just want to say, I think, you know, Tucker was right last night when he said that, you know, the establishment is
[00:54:51.149 --> 00:54:55.373]  That's right, the government became its own corporate enterprise for world government.
[00:55:20.786 --> 00:55:24.730]  And Trump literally tried to reverse that and at least have our country survive.
[00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.835]  But the globalists don't want a free country when the rest of all the countries are enslaved.
[00:55:29.135 --> 00:55:34.200]  That's why there is a project to de-industrialize, turn us against ourselves, and make us hate ourselves.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:34.521]  Period.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:36.920]  Exactly.
[00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:41.384]  And I try to tell, you know, I try to talk to my mom, you know, my sister, and they just don't get it.
[00:55:41.424 --> 00:55:48.829]  I try to talk to them nicely, but it's like you say sometimes, like if I don't talk in a nice NPR voice, really soft, they'll just, they'll just tune it out.
[00:55:49.509 --> 00:56:01.377]  And separately, I just wanted to say about the vaccine, that anybody who's concerned about it, they can refuse it because it's being distributed under emergency use authorization.
[00:56:01.397 --> 00:56:05.180]  So they can't require you to take it to go back to work or for whatever.
[00:56:06.667 --> 00:56:07.968]  Well, it's all intimidation.
[00:56:08.028 --> 00:56:22.638]  People have to organize their own private health unions, their own human rights unions, and say, this says it's dangerous, this is experimental, this wasn't even approved, and you're trying to bushwhack me into doing it in some virtue signal, and just say no.
[00:56:23.398 --> 00:56:29.222]  Or do the other thing and go, let's all wink-wink and say we got it, most of the nurses know, and slip them a hundred.
[00:56:29.662 --> 00:56:33.765]  I don't want to go that route, but that's what the medical, you think most of the medical workers take that stuff?
[00:56:34.166 --> 00:56:34.506]  No, sir.
[00:56:35.742 --> 00:56:38.046]  That's why they want tests now, to see if you've taken it.
[00:56:41.252 --> 00:56:44.898]  Yeah, but, no, but, you know, Ted Cruz flew to Cancun, so we should focus on that.
[00:56:45.796 --> 00:56:46.336]  Well, that's right.
[00:56:46.356 --> 00:56:50.657]  I mean, Ted Cruz, he went down to Cancun when he didn't have power in his house.
[00:56:50.717 --> 00:56:51.497]  Actually, a smart move.
[00:56:51.818 --> 00:56:58.959]  No, he's a horrible person, but Obama shutting down 100-plus power plants in Texas and then the actual Department of Energy document saying we couldn't turn up our power plants?
[00:56:59.319 --> 00:57:00.020]  That's okay.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.100]  That's okay.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.940]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.821]  You're a horrible person.
[00:57:03.901 --> 00:57:05.101]  Mike, don't talk bad about Joe Biden.
[00:57:05.601 --> 00:57:06.021]  I'm joking.
[00:57:06.601 --> 00:57:07.661]  James is up next.
[00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:10.182]  And then we've got so many others.
[00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:12.943]  We're taking your calls out of Tom Papert joining us.
[00:57:13.914 --> 00:57:18.436]  Oh, he got a big story out on the Communist Chinese infiltration with AT&T and Tucker Carlson covered it last night.
[00:57:18.777 --> 00:57:20.157]  I'm really proud of National File.
[00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:23.839]  All right, we'll be right back with Infowars.com.
[00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:25.700]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:26.921 --> 00:57:28.722]  Let's talk to Honey in Canada.
[00:57:28.782 --> 00:57:33.584]  Honey, on the new codes, what do you make of Joe Biden and his Alzheimer's?
[00:57:33.604 --> 00:57:36.546]  Now they're openly getting ready to 25th Amendment us, but what do you think is going to go down?
[00:57:37.555 --> 00:57:42.540]  Oh, it's definitely going to happen, but they also have to keep him alive because I believe he has a blasted nanosecond.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.540]  He's like autonomous.
[00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:50.326]  Do me a favor, your phone was clear earlier when they got you on, but... It's better right now because the iPhone isn't like... it's an XR.
[00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:50.887]  No, it's terrible.
[00:57:50.927 --> 00:57:51.107]  I know.
[00:57:51.127 --> 00:57:51.848]  Yeah, it's better now.
[00:57:51.888 --> 00:57:52.608]  Go ahead.
[00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:54.390]  Start over.
[00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.870]  Go ahead.
[00:57:56.132 --> 00:58:01.877]  Yeah, well, Joe Biden's autonomous, so he's like half robot anyways, so I think they actually could keep him alive longer than people think.
[00:58:01.977 --> 00:58:02.998]  That's my personal opinion.
[00:58:03.778 --> 00:58:04.119]  But yeah.
[00:58:05.717 --> 00:58:13.041]  Like, he's got, like, lots of, you know, medical assistance with that, but they will, you know, eventually do it, but blackouts will happen before that, you know?
[00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:14.742]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:58:14.822 --> 00:58:17.404]  A lot of people ask, why would they want a brain-dead puppet up there?
[00:58:17.684 --> 00:58:23.327]  Because they can do anything they want, and then he gets the blame later, and by the time anybody ever tries to charge him, he's dead!
[00:58:23.347 --> 00:58:28.870]  Of course, like, there's no accountability, there's no justice, you know, there's nothing
[00:58:29.614 --> 00:58:29.914]  I agree.
[00:58:29.974 --> 00:58:31.474]  I'll say this about Lindsey Graham.
[00:58:31.494 --> 00:58:32.134]  I don't like him.
[00:58:32.174 --> 00:58:38.056]  He was a minion of John McCain, but he's gotten a lot better saying we should support Trump, saying Joe Biden's a puppet, saying he's a Chinese agent.
[00:58:38.076 --> 00:58:39.856]  I mean, Lindsey Graham is actually growing a little bit of huevo.
[00:58:39.876 --> 00:58:41.336]  What do you think of that?
[00:58:57.782 --> 00:59:00.264]  Um, he probably just knows the national security threat.
[00:59:00.304 --> 00:59:04.408]  I think he knows, like, really what's going on and, like, he doesn't want to alarm people too much.
[00:59:04.468 --> 00:59:08.871]  That's why he doesn't want to stand up and be too strong, because that would actually cause people to worry, I think, more.
[00:59:09.352 --> 00:59:13.275]  So he's probably going to take it easy before... No, I agree with you, but that's a paradox.
[00:59:13.315 --> 00:59:16.938]  We need to be alarmed, but I agree, the old guard in Washington aren't complete traitors.
[00:59:17.338 --> 00:59:18.459]  They don't want to alarm people.
[00:59:18.519 --> 00:59:19.260]  We need to be alarmed.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.741]  Honey, thank you so much for your call.
[00:59:21.803 --> 00:59:23.264]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:59:23.304 --> 00:59:29.150]  Let's take a call from James in the great state of Texas, which Chuckie Schumer says, hope we learned our lesson.
[00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:35.115]  Yeah, Chuck, we know you turned off our power plants under Obama, and you wouldn't let us turn our power plants up because we're under your control.
[00:59:35.415 --> 00:59:40.000]  Yes, we learned our lesson that you're in charge of us and pissing on us and telling us it's raining.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.423]  Go ahead, James, what's your take on the nukes and the Dems wanting control of them?
[00:59:44.389 --> 00:59:53.533]  Just on a quick side note, as far as that gentleman from Canada, they assaulted him for not wearing a mask, but when you steal something, they'll probably even bag your stuff up and you can walk out the store.
[00:59:53.913 --> 00:59:54.553]  It's really sad.
[00:59:54.573 --> 00:59:58.875]  They did the same thing in a bunch of liberal cities where they let you rob the stores.
[00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:00.215]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:00.255 --> 01:00:02.536]  They would just walk out and don't do anything.
[01:00:02.556 --> 01:00:10.059]  They won't even tackle you or anything, but, you know, just as a side note, as far as nuclear codes are concerned, there's two scenarios I'm gonna play for you.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.521]  The first one, first of all, with Democrats, nothing's a coincidence.
[01:00:13.681 --> 01:00:15.562]  Everything's scripted, and everything's planned.
[01:00:16.062 --> 01:00:26.827]  So the first thing is that when they get us caught, like, you know, just sitting ducks, so when they have to go through all this red tape, you know, there's nukes flying, by the time we actually, you know, get a counter-strike going, it'll be too late.
[01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:27.647]  That's one.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.703]  Or two, the guys in the morning, they were talking about the aliens, the alien invasion.
[01:00:32.124 --> 01:00:34.766]  So I'm thinking maybe they might use that as a pretext.
[01:00:34.886 --> 01:00:46.037]  So they might, I don't know, the Americans might even, you know, they sell all their technology to China, so who knows, they might even sell the nuclear codes, so we'll just give it to them, and then probably stage an alien invasion.
[01:00:48.735 --> 01:00:50.656]  I'm afraid that they'll probably do it with a nuclear coach.
[01:00:50.676 --> 01:00:53.958]  They could probably just set up a nuke somewhere and just say, you know what, the aliens did it.
[01:00:53.978 --> 01:00:57.320]  One world government and then, you know, they'll usher in what they want to do anyways.
[01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:18.029]  Great point, thank you so much.
[01:01:18.249 --> 01:01:22.371]  All right, we've got Jake and Scott, been holding a long time.
[01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:26.212]  Peter is in Puerto Rico, says Nuke Codes, Doomsday Clock, fleeing the USA.
[01:01:26.272 --> 01:01:27.192]  I'm gonna get to you as well.
[01:01:27.592 --> 01:01:32.333]  Carl, Kirk, Joseph, we're gonna get to everybody here today.
[01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:37.435]  Tom Papert is coming up, but let's go first to Peter in Puerto Rico.
[01:01:38.175 --> 01:01:44.097]  You know, as a father, I think about fleeing the United States because we know we're a major target, but I think I'm gonna go down with the ship.
[01:01:44.937 --> 01:01:50.900]  Plus, if there's a major nuclear war, it'll probably cause a dark winter and most of the population of the world will die anyways, even in a limited exchange.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.400]  What do you think?
[01:01:52.901 --> 01:01:59.223]  I mean, honestly, if people start fleeing now, even if we go to the United States or other places, if there's a nuclear war, it's a nuclear war.
[01:02:00.344 --> 01:02:02.465]  Like, we're 100 seconds away from the doomsday clock.
[01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:05.586]  We were kind of set up to fail from it from the beginning.
[01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:08.107]  Like, we kind of just expected that there was going to be a nuclear war.
[01:02:08.127 --> 01:02:09.448]  We just didn't have enough people to do it.
[01:02:10.382 --> 01:02:14.484]  Now there's enough people on the planet, people are kind of getting vaccinated, that's not killing enough people.
[01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.345]  Might as well just accelerate it, right?
[01:02:17.966 --> 01:02:24.990]  Exactly, and all these billionaires have super deep bases, private airfields, and they all think New Zealand's the safe spot.
[01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:30.813]  I mean, I told you, I knew a major Hollywood director 15 years ago said, James Cameron's going to make a few more movies and he's done.
[01:02:31.273 --> 01:02:34.715]  He's moving to New Zealand, but he thinks New Zealand may fall, so he has a cover.
[01:02:35.515 --> 01:02:35.936]  We're good to go.
[01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:53.514]  Right.
[01:02:53.574 --> 01:02:56.916]  I mean, you're better off at an island, I guess, if you... I'm from here.
[01:02:57.037 --> 01:02:58.618]  I'm actually an indigenous person from here.
[01:02:59.178 --> 01:03:00.419]  Literally all my family's from here.
[01:03:00.759 --> 01:03:07.904]  I came over here six months after the hurricane to take care of some elderly family because pretty much the massive population of Puerto Rico is just all old people.
[01:03:08.604 --> 01:03:13.067]  Like, I'm coming from a dying dependency because pretty much the majority of my people are just, you know, they're all old.
[01:03:13.828 --> 01:03:17.250]  But not... I haven't come around to have kids, so I'm just kind of taking care of them.
[01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:18.871]  Well, that's good of you to do that.
[01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:20.792]  You gotta honor your parents.
[01:03:22.892 --> 01:03:23.793]  We're leaving this place.
[01:03:23.993 --> 01:03:29.056]  I remember the ex-governor fucking promoted Trump right before and it just fucking went out the window.
[01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:29.597]  It went out the window.
[01:03:29.617 --> 01:03:30.217]  We gotta let you go.
[01:03:30.437 --> 01:03:36.702]  You can get one cuss word in but we gotta hit a delay and then if you do it again, we gotta, for the stations, we gotta hang up on you but I appreciate your call.
[01:03:37.423 --> 01:03:37.943]  Good points.
[01:03:37.963 --> 01:03:38.984]  I appreciate your call, Puerto Rico.
[01:03:39.004 --> 01:03:40.185]  Okay, so we'll get to Carl.
[01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:50.334]  We'll get to Kirk, we'll get to Scott, and everybody else coming up, but first we're going to talk to Tom Pappard on some really big issues of the communist Chinese infiltration.
[01:03:50.354 --> 01:03:52.636]  But America doesn't stand up for itself.
[01:03:53.017 --> 01:03:55.299]  It's become very fashionable to sell the country out.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:01.966]  The big law firms and bankers all did it, but the Chinese aren't bankers, and they're not lawyers, and the globalists aren't either.
[01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:02.966]  They want domination.
[01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:11.295]  And so all these little sycophants, they sold out America, they're building a global government for global peace, and all this is being done for a greater detente.
[01:04:11.635 --> 01:04:15.136]  We're going to get rid of the family and get rid of men, so there's not wars in the future.
[01:04:15.176 --> 01:04:16.677]  That's all Carnegie Foundation stuff.
[01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:18.218]  That's mid-level brainwashing.
[01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:30.063]  At the top, though, it's about global domination and total control, getting everybody to give up their freedom and their rights, and any checks or balances and any deterrents show this world government can take over.
[01:04:30.184 --> 01:04:32.985]  And then the real extermination begins as you're all
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.860]  Got experience just like I am.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:37.761]  We've all got front row seats to it.
[01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:40.881]  So I'm not going to just sit here in the bleachers while this all goes down.
[01:04:40.901 --> 01:04:45.642]  I'm going to be engaged and involved fighting against this.
[01:04:47.222 --> 01:04:48.623]  We'll be right back with Tom Pappert.
[01:04:48.663 --> 01:04:53.903]  NationalFile.com broke a big Chai Com infiltration story two days ago that Tucker Carlson picked up.
[01:04:54.484 --> 01:04:55.924]  More and more National File is doing that.
[01:04:55.944 --> 01:04:56.524]  I'm so proud of them.
[01:04:56.784 --> 01:04:57.444]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.464 --> 01:04:57.844]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.364 --> 01:05:02.185]  Major global corporations want to invest in China.
[01:05:03.988 --> 01:05:09.554]  Because the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO have decided that's the place you can dump toxic waste.
[01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:11.696]  That's the place you can run dirty power plants.
[01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:16.541]  That's the place you can literally kill your employees and have giant death camps run by Apple.
[01:05:17.642 --> 01:05:19.023]  That's the happy hunting ground.
[01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:33.077]  And so, NationalFile.com that I'm really excited about, because we have Tom Papert and other people that are involved in it and own it on as co-hosts with us, is just kicking butt, going where others don't dare.
[01:05:33.117 --> 01:05:36.360]  And now, every few days, I see stories they break becoming national news.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.345]  Tucker Carlson, Corey Stewart discuss National File exclusive AT&T lobbying.
[01:05:43.146 --> 01:05:47.508]  To work with CCP-controlled telecom giants, something Trump was battling.
[01:05:47.528 --> 01:05:50.029]  And again, Edward Snowden exposed all this.
[01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.769]  We already knew this.
[01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:59.353]  But all these companies put chips that track and control and can be remotely accessed with back doors for the companies themselves.
[01:05:59.853 --> 01:06:01.494]  But then they sell them to other governments.
[01:06:01.554 --> 01:06:02.094]  So the U.S.
[01:06:02.134 --> 01:06:06.676]  government did this in the early days in power plant equipment, microchips, you name it.
[01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.697]  But China has been doing it to us forever, too.
[01:06:09.477 --> 01:06:10.738]  Then hackers figure it out.
[01:06:10.818 --> 01:06:12.579]  Then groups get held hostage.
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.784]  So the fact that all these back doors are built in for law enforcement and governments is back doors for everybody else.
[01:06:17.844 --> 01:06:19.405]  And then law enforcement sells the codes.
[01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:20.766]  Governments sell the codes.
[01:06:21.046 --> 01:06:21.626]  It's a nightmare.
[01:06:21.967 --> 01:06:28.772]  But then if you have the 5G, they're able to energize small transistors in the chips.
[01:06:29.392 --> 01:06:31.874]  And I first broke this 20 years ago with a scientist that came on.
[01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:33.496]  He died right after he came on, by the way.
[01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:36.768]  I was told he's probably murdered, but side issue.
[01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:47.795]  We have one of the patents on it where they can energize the chips and then 5G is close enough and powerful enough to actually get the data compressed off in a radio transmission, basically, or a wireless transmission.
[01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:50.417]  So there's a lot of layers to this, but you need to see the movie.
[01:06:50.857 --> 01:06:52.879]  Excellent movie Snowden put out.
[01:06:53.959 --> 01:07:00.202]  Of course, by the maker of the famous JFK movie and so many other great films, but it's dead on from the research.
[01:07:00.242 --> 01:07:05.885]  That's Oliver Stone, a real liberal, not a fascist liberal, wants to support death camps in China like Joe Biden, but a real liberal.
[01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:09.547]  Don't agree with all his policies, but at least he's a moral guy, isn't for death camps.
[01:07:09.867 --> 01:07:12.848]  And so I wanted to get Tom Papert on just for about 30 minutes.
[01:07:12.868 --> 01:07:14.529]  We'll take more of your calls and have a guest on.
[01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:18.431]  But let's go to a few minutes of Tucker Carlson last night, breaking this down.
[01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:28.318]  We've confirmed that AT&T lobbied the Department of Commerce not to levy sanctions against China Telecom, which is a large state-owned corporation headquartered in Beijing.
[01:07:28.718 --> 01:07:30.500]  This was first reported by the National File.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.605]  Specifically, we know that AT&T worked to keep China Telecom off of something called the Entity List.
[01:07:37.046 --> 01:07:42.951]  That list blocks companies from selling American products and technology to certain foreign firms without first getting a license.
[01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:47.417]  Corey Stewart is the former Undersecretary of Commerce for Industry and Security.
[01:07:47.437 --> 01:07:51.662]  He has first-hand knowledge of what happened, and he joins us tonight to explain.
[01:07:51.702 --> 01:07:53.364]  Corey Stewart, I appreciate your coming on tonight.
[01:07:53.704 --> 01:07:54.625]  It's hard to believe that AT&T...
[01:07:57.263 --> 01:07:58.964]  You think of it as an American company.
[01:07:59.364 --> 01:08:02.726]  Would lobby on behalf of a company controlled by the Chinese military?
[01:08:02.806 --> 01:08:05.887]  Tell us, if you would, what you know about this and why it happened.
[01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:12.630]  Well, you know, as I was undersecretary, it was very disturbing because we had a lot of indications.
[01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:25.476]  There's very good intelligence out there that the Chinese government, through its basically state-owned subsidiary of China Telecom, has been using cell phone technology, telecommunications technology,
[01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:52.129]  To track minority populations in China, to spy on them, and then to hand this information over to the China Police State, and they're rounding up the Uyghur population, which is a minority Muslim group in Western China, as well as Tibetans and other minorities, and placing these people in essentially modern-day concentration camps, where there's widespread reports of gang rapes, of torture,
[01:08:52.329 --> 01:08:52.489]  I think?
[01:09:08.272 --> 01:09:26.972]  China Telecom on the entity list to put sanctions upon them when we are contacted by Ed Gillespie the executive vice president of AT&T who urged us not to place China Telecom despite these abuses on the entity list and needless to say we were pretty much shocked by that.
[01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:29.172]  Come on, man!
[01:09:29.272 --> 01:09:35.094]  It's just a cultural norm to have three million Muslims in death camps and a million Christians in bodas and sell their organs.
[01:09:35.494 --> 01:09:36.375]  Come on, man!
[01:09:36.415 --> 01:09:38.496]  Let them invade Hong Kong and shoot women in the street.
[01:09:38.836 --> 01:09:40.036]  Come on, man!
[01:09:40.536 --> 01:09:42.277]  Come on, Tom Papert!
[01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:44.258]  So, Tom, how'd you guys break this story?
[01:09:44.298 --> 01:09:45.238]  Good job breaking it.
[01:09:46.579 --> 01:09:48.580]  It's a huge story and really frightening as well.
[01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:53.037]  Well, Alex, we first got wind, you know, you need to look at AT&T.
[01:09:53.057 --> 01:10:00.599]  We had people who asked to remain anonymous telling us, look at what AT&T was doing in the final days, weeks, and months of the Trump administration.
[01:10:00.879 --> 01:10:15.303]  Before you know it, we were able to connect with Corey Stewart, great individual, former Undersecretary of Commerce for the Trump administration, who confirmed that, yes, not only was AT&T lobbying to keep this China telecom, which is 100% CCP controlled, off the entity list,
[01:10:15.843 --> 01:10:21.388]  But Ed Gillespie, the former chair of the RNC, is actually the guy who made the call.
[01:10:21.428 --> 01:10:29.015]  Corey Stewart was on a conference call with Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, and Ed Gillespie, former RNC chair, and himself.
[01:10:29.295 --> 01:10:35.801]  And on that call, he lobbied on behalf of AT&T to be allowed to continue doing work with China Telecom.
[01:10:36.101 --> 01:11:04.317]  Which, as Corey Stewart said on Tucker Carlson, we, the government, the Trump administration, the so-called vaunted intelligence community, has credible, actionable intelligence, Alex, saying that this telecom giant, which is, again, 100% owned by the Communist Party, this giant is using the data from all of the phones in China to locate, arrest, and detain, and eventually put Uyghur minority groups and other ethnic minority groups in China into concentration camps.
[01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:09.841]  Let's not forget, who owns CNN?
[01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.982]  A-T-N-T.
[01:11:12.622 --> 01:11:16.445]  So when you see a CNN town hall and they ask, what do you think of the Uyghurs?
[01:11:16.465 --> 01:11:18.026]  You're like, come on man, kill them!
[01:11:18.206 --> 01:11:18.946]  Come on man!
[01:11:20.107 --> 01:11:21.988]  But meanwhile, we've got video.
[01:11:22.108 --> 01:11:24.350]  Students believe Trump is killing the Uyghurs.
[01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:25.471]  You like that?
[01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:27.272]  They believe those are Trump quotes.
[01:11:27.312 --> 01:11:28.633]  That's mind control, Tom.
[01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.231]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:11:31.271 --> 01:11:33.912]  And it's no coincidence that they own CNN, of course, where you're right.
[01:11:33.952 --> 01:11:39.173]  They have Joe Biden on and they joke about killing off this million strong population group.
[01:11:39.193 --> 01:11:42.854]  And it's not just the Uyghurs, by the way, but all across China.
[01:11:43.114 --> 01:11:45.415]  And he says, oh, well, it's just different cultural norms.
[01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:48.556]  I mean, this guy is worse than Chamberlain because he's enabling it.
[01:11:48.576 --> 01:11:50.116]  He's sponsored by his son.
[01:11:50.136 --> 01:11:51.776]  This is not an aggressive Muslim group.
[01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:52.697]  They're homogeneous.
[01:11:52.737 --> 01:11:53.057]  They're there.
[01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:54.137]  They've been there a thousand years.
[01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:55.357]  They're not expanding.
[01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:55.958]  They're not bad.
[01:11:56.298 --> 01:11:57.378]  The Chinese on record
[01:11:58.018 --> 01:12:05.261]  In rape gangs, rape the women to have Chinese children, for whatever reason, just like they did the Tibetans.
[01:12:05.301 --> 01:12:07.542]  Remember when the liberals were all against the rape of Tibet?
[01:12:07.562 --> 01:12:12.345]  It was called the rape of Tibet, literal rape of Tibet, where they kill the men, rape the women to ethically take over.
[01:12:12.365 --> 01:12:13.145]  That's wrong!
[01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:16.066]  But see, oh, but it's an Asian raping an Asian.
[01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:16.947]  It's okay, Tom.
[01:12:16.987 --> 01:12:17.547]  It's not, is it?
[01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.595]  No, absolutely not, Alex, and you're right.
[01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:23.177]  These aren't the people that are in ISIS.
[01:12:23.217 --> 01:12:25.239]  These aren't the people like Boko Haram.
[01:12:25.459 --> 01:12:31.363]  No, these are essentially peasant farmers who have lived the same lifestyle for 2,000 years almost.
[01:12:31.883 --> 01:12:35.366]  Before they were Muslim, they were just regular peasant farmers who were probably Buddhists.
[01:12:35.646 --> 01:12:37.867]  Then along came Allah, and now they're Muslims.
[01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:39.748]  But no, these are not suicide bombers.
[01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:41.069]  These are not ISIS members.
[01:12:41.289 --> 01:12:49.273]  This is the equivalent of going to rural Texas and picking up people who have a Bible and pray to God because they don't look like the people in the big cities.
[01:12:49.353 --> 01:12:53.175]  And again, AT&T defended this now in two separate statements.
[01:12:53.435 --> 01:13:02.340]  They justify it by saying they wouldn't have been able to make $125 billion with a B in profit unless they were allowed to do business in China.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.601]  You see, if they weren't doing business in China, Alex,
[01:13:04.941 --> 01:13:09.724]  Well, then a Chinese state-owned company would have to do it, and AT&T wouldn't get all that money.
[01:13:09.904 --> 01:13:13.467]  That is honestly, almost verbatim, AT&T's defense.
[01:13:13.487 --> 01:13:15.088]  Well, we'll stay there, but I want to come back and talk about this.
[01:13:15.928 --> 01:13:29.777]  We criticize Islam when their Muslims are acid-attacking women, honor killings, trying to invade, say they're going to make us submit, burning down churches, radical Wahhabist Islam, invading Syria.
[01:13:29.817 --> 01:13:30.698]  We're against all that.
[01:13:31.678 --> 01:13:34.979]  Invading other countries like Libya, Hillary defending it.
[01:13:35.239 --> 01:13:36.319]  I came, I saw, he died.
[01:13:36.559 --> 01:13:37.139]  We're against that.
[01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:38.980]  But we're not for putting Muslims in death camps.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.400]  Liberals, as you know online, are like, screw it!
[01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:45.121]  We need to put Americans in camps like Xi Jinping does the Uyghurs.
[01:13:45.441 --> 01:13:48.822]  A top Democratic Party head in California said that, remember?
[01:13:49.082 --> 01:13:49.702]  Two weeks ago.
[01:13:50.002 --> 01:13:52.063]  They have embraced death camps, Tom.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.081]  No, that's exactly right, and they're trying to export it into the United States, or I guess import it, the Democrats are.
[01:13:59.381 --> 01:14:09.484]  In fact, the next big step is we now know that AT&T is being lobbied by the Democrats to dump Fox News, dump Newsmax, dump the rest of them, the same organization that is okay, I guess, with Bethlehem.
[01:14:09.524 --> 01:14:10.284]  Yeah, let's go there next!
[01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:20.047]  AT&T that owns CNN is trying to muscle the rest of the cable networks and the rest of the satellite systems to dump Fox, Newsmax, OAN, and then they want our URLs.
[01:14:20.427 --> 01:14:20.927]  Yeah, folks!
[01:14:21.627 --> 01:14:23.688]  Yep, Congress and Trump missed the boat on this.
[01:14:23.729 --> 01:14:24.389]  They put up with it.
[01:14:24.589 --> 01:14:26.270]  So now the censorship's going total.
[01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:29.112]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got good news.
[01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.193]  We're all saved.
[01:14:30.213 --> 01:14:33.115]  Don't worry about the nuclear codes being transferred to the CHICOMS.
[01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.997]  Don't worry about the collapsing border of the dollar.
[01:14:36.637 --> 01:14:36.998]  No!
[01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:38.199]  No!
[01:14:39.499 --> 01:14:41.981]  Mr. Potato Head is now a tranny!
[01:14:44.383 --> 01:14:47.185]  Yes, made in the image of Stelter.
[01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:55.016]  Mr. Potato Head to become gender-neutral to allow kids to create same-sex families where you never have kids.
[01:14:55.136 --> 01:14:56.157]  Yay!
[01:14:56.177 --> 01:15:03.918]  1 in 6 Americans under 23 say they're LGBTQXYZ and some people in the U.S.
[01:15:06.059 --> 01:15:09.079]  even identify as non-heterosexual, whatever the hell that means.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.460]  It's so cool.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.300]  It's so trendy.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.241]  Like eating bugs and drinking sewage and
[01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:16.927]  Eating weeds.
[01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:18.148]  Klaus Schwab said so.
[01:15:18.408 --> 01:15:19.029]  I'm doing it.
[01:15:19.309 --> 01:15:19.950]  I love it.
[01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:22.633]  It's super, Mr. Sterilized Head.
[01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:23.754]  Oh, great.
[01:15:23.794 --> 01:15:24.635]  I love Atrazine.
[01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:26.117]  I'm not a male or a female.
[01:15:26.157 --> 01:15:27.138]  I've just got cancer.
[01:15:27.519 --> 01:15:28.239]  Thank you!
[01:15:28.259 --> 01:15:28.299]  No!
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:29.381]  Oh!
[01:15:30.642 --> 01:15:31.403]  Oh!
[01:15:31.703 --> 01:15:32.464]  I'm dying.
[01:15:32.504 --> 01:15:33.886]  It's so liberal.
[01:15:35.845 --> 01:15:38.748]  We're going to go back to Tom Pappert and then I promise I'm going to all your calls.
[01:15:38.828 --> 01:15:42.272]  Carl and Carl and Kirk and Jake and Scott and Carl.
[01:15:43.053 --> 01:15:47.637]  This is like winning the lottery or winning the slot machine to have three Carls in a row here, okay?
[01:15:47.657 --> 01:15:50.841]  This is Carl in San Antonio, Carl in Austin, Carl in Kansas.
[01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:54.725]  We'll just take the Carls in first and then we'll have another guest popping in.
[01:15:56.867 --> 01:15:57.328]  Separately.
[01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:06.225]  As crazy as things are, we definitely want to stay on air, and we sell great products that we know you need to be symbiotic at the same time.
[01:16:06.285 --> 01:16:07.846]  So, high-quality, storable foods.
[01:16:07.886 --> 01:16:08.627]  We never do this.
[01:16:09.027 --> 01:16:11.990]  Free shipping and 10% off because of the emergencies and the crises.
[01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.071]  They have four distribution centers ready to ship.

[01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:25.439]  10% off and free shipping.
[01:16:25.959 --> 01:16:29.479]  Infowarsstore.com, part of the Fortify Your Supply.
[01:16:29.539 --> 01:16:31.840]  Time to stock up and prepare and save now.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.581]  And we also have the Privacy Pockets with free shipping.

[01:16:41.742 --> 01:16:42.842]  We have the Winter Sun.
[01:16:43.423 --> 01:16:46.203]  We have so much more at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:48.724]  We have the Fluoride Free Concentrated
[01:16:51.795 --> 01:16:54.257]  Activated charcoal toothpaste that my dad, a dentist, designed.
[01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:55.018]  People love so much.
[01:16:55.318 --> 01:16:56.779]  That's all discounted with free shipping.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.060]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:00.122]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:17:00.162 --> 01:17:01.603]  That's how you fund the mothership.
[01:17:02.444 --> 01:17:04.005]  Not many motherships out there.
[01:17:04.045 --> 01:17:05.006]  Not many ships left.
[01:17:05.807 --> 01:17:06.508]  Takeover.
[01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:07.568]  Whatever.
[01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:09.470]  It's going to get so bad, we're going to win in the end.
[01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.292]  I won't be around for it probably, but...
[01:17:12.233 --> 01:17:13.615]  We're good to go.
[01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:32.479]  Well, it's crazy, is everybody following?
[01:17:32.639 --> 01:17:33.140]  Yes, sir!
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.462]  We'll do whatever you say, sir!
[01:17:35.123 --> 01:17:36.785]  But, sorry, Tom Papper, getting back to you.
[01:17:37.587 --> 01:17:41.954]  Yes, the big move is now de-platform Fox News.
[01:17:41.974 --> 01:17:44.478]  De-platform everyone, so tell us about it.
[01:17:46.121 --> 01:17:48.563]  There's an important kind of timeline thing to consider here.
[01:17:48.643 --> 01:18:00.651]  This decision was being made literally in the last days of the Trump administration, whether or not to remove or to add, I should say, China Telecom to the entity list, which again would ban them from working with AT&T.
[01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:10.617]  AT&T, of course, on January 6th made the decision they would no longer donate to any Republican whatsoever if they even said something about election integrity.
[01:18:10.657 --> 01:18:15.440]  You're no longer allowed to have a free and fair election in the United States of America, according to AT&T.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:23.505]  Now, of course, we have a letter from the Democrats in Congress being sent to AT&T's top guy, who I kid you not, his last name is Stanky.
[01:18:23.545 --> 01:18:24.766]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:18:25.246 --> 01:18:34.152]  And they are ordering him to provide information about how many people watch Fox News, how many people watch OAN, how many people watch conservative networks.
[01:18:34.452 --> 01:18:52.424]  And I would not be surprised if AT&T, which of course is now an enemy of Tucker Carlson because Tucker dared to tell the truth and reference our story on his broadcast, I would not be surprised at all to see AT&T go along with the Democrat demand to bring in Chinese-style censorship of anything that does not parrot the official party line.
[01:18:54.653 --> 01:18:56.256]  Well, look at what Senator Leahy said.
[01:18:56.276 --> 01:18:57.718]  He goes, the troops don't leave D.C.
[01:18:57.758 --> 01:19:00.984]  until we've routed out the terrorists, and that's pro-American.
[01:19:01.044 --> 01:19:02.426]  So, it's official, folks.
[01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.949]  They're gonna make their run at us.
[01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.831]  This is real.
[01:19:06.716 --> 01:19:07.457]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:08.918]  I mean, it can't be denied anymore.
[01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:17.564]  Anybody who still thinks something is going to happen on the 4th or any other day before maybe November of 2022 and 2024 is deluded and fooling themselves.
[01:19:17.825 --> 01:19:21.227]  We have America's top companies, the most powerful companies in the world.
[01:19:21.287 --> 01:19:26.351]  I mean, AT&T merged with DirecTV and now they probably control a third of the country's cable market.
[01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:29.534]  This is a corporate global coup against we the people.
[01:19:30.094 --> 01:19:31.035]  Backed up by China.
[01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:33.057]  And we all wake up to it and say, no, we'll win.
[01:19:33.077 --> 01:19:35.279]  But instead, like, we're all heroes wearing masks.
[01:19:35.579 --> 01:19:36.780]  We're all heroes.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.803]  But Fauci's like, even if you take the shot, you can't leave your house.
[01:19:40.264 --> 01:19:42.125]  Children have to be in pods now at school.
[01:19:42.165 --> 01:19:44.067]  It's like, what can they get us to do?
[01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:45.749]  It's a total cult.
[01:19:47.594 --> 01:19:48.455]  That's exactly right.
[01:19:48.495 --> 01:19:50.878]  It is a cult, and it's a cult of death.
[01:19:50.979 --> 01:19:53.542]  It is a death cult that is going to lead to this country.
[01:19:53.782 --> 01:19:54.944]  I mean, Alex, you know what they want.
[01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.085]  They want depopulation.
[01:19:56.105 --> 01:20:02.534]  They want China to be the new motherland because they know that the Chinese communists, or so they believe, that the Chinese communists
[01:20:02.574 --> 01:20:02.734]  I think?
[01:20:19.053 --> 01:20:22.515]  And it's time for people to fight back however they can, legally and lawfully.
[01:20:22.815 --> 01:20:30.258]  I mean, it may not seem like a powerful move, but if you're on an AT&T cell phone network, get off that thing yesterday.
[01:20:30.338 --> 01:20:39.703]  Go to a slightly, moderately, 10%, 1% less evil corporation, and let them know that, sorry, we're not going to let you use that as an excuse.
[01:20:39.763 --> 01:20:44.625]  We know that you have to make money, but $125 billion dollars as a sponsor of genocide?
[01:20:45.165 --> 01:20:50.447]  They have to criticize America, say we're evil, say we're bad, say we're the bad model, so we accept communist China.
[01:20:50.668 --> 01:20:53.449]  That's a thousand times worse than anything we ever dreamed of doing.
[01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:57.191]  So the Chinese communist model is the model of the world, not America.
[01:20:57.551 --> 01:21:03.313]  The British Empire 200 years ago said, we can't allow the American model to work because people want to be free and they'll follow it.
[01:21:03.574 --> 01:21:06.115]  So the system's always been at war with the American model.
[01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:07.896]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:10.337]  It's the American model that creates the middle class.
[01:21:10.677 --> 01:21:12.358]  It's the Chinese model that creates slaves.
[01:21:13.018 --> 01:21:14.359]  What you're saying is absolutely true.
[01:21:14.639 --> 01:21:22.544]  And people better start championing their rights instead of behaving like if they wink at totalitarianism, they're somehow part of it on the winning team.
[01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:22.844]  No!
[01:21:23.124 --> 01:21:24.885]  It's called being a useful idiot, a schmuck.
[01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:28.593]  Well, in China, by the way, they have no middle class.
[01:21:28.653 --> 01:21:30.815]  Any middle class they have is completely artificial.
[01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:36.521]  They have an economy that cannot, will not grow because nobody is actually allowed to go out and create value.
[01:21:36.821 --> 01:21:48.472]  They are so desperate to create an artificial middle class right now that they're building railroads and airports and everything you can imagine in countries that are nowhere near China and are not even part of their Belt and Road Initiative.
[01:21:48.732 --> 01:21:58.659]  They're doing it just because they have to justify giving people a wage so they can then go back to China and buy products that are made in China and I guess get their TV and internet from AT&T.
[01:21:58.899 --> 01:22:09.627]  Which again Alex, the most disgusting claim in all of this is that AT&T says it's all okay because other American trader companies that are working in China, well they need AT&T services.
[01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:22.535]  And if AT&T didn't make all this money, if AT&T wasn't the spearhead of the corporate power structure, redesigning society in George Soros' image and Xi Jinping's image, well then another company would make that money.
[01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:30.681]  It's absolutely atrocious and I hope that this is a wake-up call to Americans to understand exactly what corporate America wants, especially Republicans, Alex.
[01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:35.544]  You've been a great enemy of the corporate oligarchs in this country your entire career.
[01:22:35.624 --> 01:22:39.767]  The majority of the Republican Party is just now understanding how right you were.
[01:22:41.327 --> 01:22:46.309]  Tom, you did a great job, because I watch most mornings at least an hour of National File.
[01:22:46.349 --> 01:22:51.951]  Harrison Smith does a great job, and his wife, blessedly, just gave birth to a child a few days ago that's healthy, so that's good news.
[01:22:52.711 --> 01:22:55.632]  But I know you're a busy beaver, but you've been wanting to do a show with us.
[01:22:56.312 --> 01:23:00.934]  As soon as Harrison comes back, I think you guys should co-host together, because it's a really good National File.
[01:23:01.234 --> 01:23:04.415]  Does a great job of breaking news with us, with American Journal.
[01:23:04.995 --> 01:23:05.455]  8 a.m.
[01:23:05.535 --> 01:23:06.136]  to 11 a.m.
[01:23:06.156 --> 01:23:07.056]  when I go live every day.
[01:23:07.376 --> 01:23:10.198]  And you'll be hosting a lot, of course, in the next few days and next week.
[01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:13.539]  So thank you so much, Tom Pappert, at nationalfile.com.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.620]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.082]  It's always a pleasure, and I can't wait to see Harrison back.
[01:23:18.142 --> 01:23:24.765]  And I'll just say one more time, congratulations to all the InfoWars community on a new family member, a 10th generation Texas.
[01:23:25.025 --> 01:23:26.886]  My God, Alex, you picked a good one with Harrison.
[01:23:27.486 --> 01:23:27.986]  That's right.
[01:23:28.106 --> 01:23:29.347]  There's not many of those around.
[01:23:31.829 --> 01:23:34.312]  In closing, we've got some good news.
[01:23:34.512 --> 01:23:44.024]  Rand Paul, who's a medical doctor, just skewered the health secretary that says we need orgies, but wear your mask, and that we need to mutilate children's genitals.
[01:23:44.585 --> 01:23:46.107]  And Rand Paul just came out next hour.
[01:23:46.127 --> 01:23:46.668]  I'm going to play it.
[01:23:47.028 --> 01:23:48.249]  It just happened just an hour ago.
[01:23:48.309 --> 01:23:49.149]  I'm getting all these texts.
[01:23:49.209 --> 01:23:49.829]  It's gone viral.
[01:23:49.849 --> 01:23:51.470]  We're posting it on Infowars.com.
[01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:54.111]  And he said, this is genital mutilation like Islam does.
[01:23:54.591 --> 01:23:57.472]  You are obsessed with chopping little boys' penises off.
[01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.593]  I mean, that's what this is, is a cult, man.
[01:23:59.813 --> 01:24:06.776]  We've got to call it out with these weird educational perverts obsessed with chopping little boys' genitals off.
[01:24:11.048 --> 01:24:14.350]  Well, you know, maybe Rand Paul's neighbor was right.
[01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.152]  Rand Paul is a doctor.
[01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:17.953]  He went to medical school.
[01:24:18.033 --> 01:24:28.962]  All of these Twitter little sociopaths and this Levine character who looks like Mr. Potato Head in a dress, Mrs. Potato Head, these are the people who are insane and these are the people who are wrong.
[01:24:29.243 --> 01:24:30.163]  Dr. Rand Paul has a point.
[01:24:30.183 --> 01:24:33.746]  But I mean, parents don't talk about sex with their children until they're 13 or 14 or whatever.
[01:24:35.888 --> 01:24:42.330]  Jocelyn Elders that Bill Clinton tried to put in, sort of general like, help the children touch their wreaths down and touch them.
[01:24:42.651 --> 01:24:45.111]  Oh, this is a cult of pedos in my view.
[01:24:45.752 --> 01:24:47.092]  All right, thank you Tom Pepper.
[01:24:47.252 --> 01:24:49.113]  NationalFile.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:24:49.213 --> 01:24:50.473]  Infowars.com as well.
[01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:51.474]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:52.898 --> 01:24:57.020]  These demons can't rule us unless they destabilize us and cut us off from God.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.781]  All we gotta do is open that channel up to God and say, God, I'm weak, but I'm open to you.
[01:25:01.942 --> 01:25:02.502]  Save me.
[01:25:03.082 --> 01:25:03.822]  Energize me.
[01:25:03.862 --> 01:25:06.223]  And you're gonna get hit with the energy.
[01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:08.484]  You're gonna get hit with the discernment.
[01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:10.485]  Only question is, can you take it?
[01:25:12.739 --> 01:25:17.863]  All right, let's go to your phone calls, and then I've got this incredible Rand Paul testimony that just happened an hour ago.
[01:25:18.323 --> 01:25:25.488]  It's up on InfoWars.com, calling the emperor out with no clothes, calling out the elephant in the room, calling out the pervert.
[01:25:25.868 --> 01:25:27.550]  I mean, it's just, it's powerful.
[01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:29.931]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:25:30.312 --> 01:25:30.852]  Carl?
[01:25:30.872 --> 01:25:33.494]  Is Carl holding the longest or is it Scott?
[01:25:37.401 --> 01:25:39.042]  That'll be Scott in Virginia, then Carl.
[01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:40.663]  Thank you for holding, Scott.
[01:25:40.703 --> 01:25:41.003]  Go ahead.
[01:25:41.043 --> 01:25:48.308]  What is your view on the Democrat Party wants the nuke codes and the new hunchback Attorney General wants the nuke codes?
[01:25:48.348 --> 01:25:51.811]  I mean, Swallowsville says he wants to use nukes on American gun owners.
[01:25:52.251 --> 01:25:53.952]  So why do you think this is happening?
[01:25:54.692 --> 01:26:02.678]  Well, first of all, it's very complicated, but it seems to me like there's a... Initially, I thought there was a lot of internal fighting going on.
[01:26:03.536 --> 01:26:08.998]  If they wanted the new codes from, if they wanted the football from Biden, if he's just a puppet, why don't they just take it?
[01:26:10.158 --> 01:26:14.760]  But, you know, there's so much turmoil and there's so much confusion.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.420]  Well, these are knuckle-dragging lawyers.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.961]  They always want it authorized, you understand?
[01:26:19.361 --> 01:26:21.482]  Like, they want pedophilia legal so they can do it.
[01:26:21.842 --> 01:26:23.343]  They want to get it out in the open, that's why.
[01:26:24.063 --> 01:26:27.604]  I think it's kind of like the Tower of Babel, where they all are building this tower.
[01:26:29.274 --> 01:26:29.774]  I agree.
[01:26:29.814 --> 01:26:35.340]  They all want the power of AI and cloning, but none of them are in control of it and it ends up destroying them.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:35.620]  That's right.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.482]  And God knocks it down and scatters them.
[01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:39.324]  And it's like the Battle of the Bulge.
[01:26:39.484 --> 01:26:43.628]  We're seeing the bulge right now, but we're going to prevail in the end.
[01:26:43.648 --> 01:26:44.509]  We're going to take it out.
[01:26:44.529 --> 01:26:44.709]  I agree.
[01:26:44.749 --> 01:26:48.033]  Explain to them this big, giant counter-offensive happens, but it falls apart.
[01:26:48.905 --> 01:26:49.725]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:49.845 --> 01:26:54.867]  And as the world wakes up, we're going to make our move.
[01:26:55.508 --> 01:26:56.468]  I don't know what it is.
[01:26:56.648 --> 01:26:58.109]  It's, you know, the Holy Spirit.
[01:26:58.269 --> 01:26:59.289]  God's will prevails.
[01:26:59.929 --> 01:27:09.713]  We all, you know, focus on waking our neighbors up and, you know, and like I said, let the Holy Spirit prevail and take over, take back control.
[01:27:09.733 --> 01:27:14.535]  Well, you know what the symbol of Davos and the UN has been the last decade is the Tower of Babel.
[01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:19.085]  Well, the Indy is not good for the Tower.
[01:27:19.245 --> 01:27:23.227]  I agree, but why would they, the EU as well, use it as a symbol?
[01:27:23.667 --> 01:27:24.607]  Like, they're proud of it.
[01:27:24.627 --> 01:27:26.128]  They're like, oh, we're going to make it work this time.
[01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.389]  Well, I think you explain it show after show after show.
[01:27:29.969 --> 01:27:36.631]  It's their attempt to, you know, God condemn them here on this planet.
[01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:41.393]  And the only way they can escape is, you know, through the use of humanity.
[01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:43.252]  So they think they're there.
[01:27:43.352 --> 01:27:45.334]  They're, you know, they're flying missions to Mars.
[01:27:45.394 --> 01:27:47.156]  They're about to make that move.
[01:27:47.636 --> 01:27:49.338]  And then they eliminate humanity.
[01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:53.862]  I believe you were saying yesterday, you know, like wearing the mask.
[01:27:54.322 --> 01:27:59.187]  We are built in the image of God and they need to destroy us and cut our heads off, whatever they got to do.
[01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:00.488]  They have a
[01:28:01.842 --> 01:28:07.146]  That's it, because it's like a full-grown man beating up a three-year-old toddler.
[01:28:07.187 --> 01:28:13.572]  We're going to be way more advanced than them, successful, but they can only beat us up because we are in an embryonic form right now.
[01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:19.176]  In fact, I forgot that the UN building in the World Court actually is the Tower of Babel.
[01:28:19.196 --> 01:28:19.917]  They actually built it.
[01:28:20.017 --> 01:28:22.559]  If you're a radio listener, I know that sounds crazy, folks.
[01:28:22.619 --> 01:28:23.880]  I'm showing it on TV.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.563]  Is MemoryServe, is that the World Court, or is that the International Bank of Settlements?
[01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.946]  I'm going from memory here because they built a couple buildings like it.
[01:28:31.347 --> 01:28:32.168]  Great point, Scott.
[01:28:32.188 --> 01:28:32.628]  Anything else?
[01:28:33.269 --> 01:28:39.236]  But I think I think it's like Godzilla versus King Kong, and there's going to be some collateral damage.
[01:28:39.296 --> 01:28:45.945]  But I think there's going to be so much infighting going on amongst our enemy that they're going to take themselves down along with, you know.
[01:28:46.548 --> 01:28:47.389]  No, I agree with you.
[01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:50.690]  That's why we can't get depressed, and we can't hurt ourselves or hurt others.
[01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:52.612]  And believe me, I'm talking to myself when I say that.
[01:28:53.132 --> 01:28:54.533]  We just need to be cool and trust in God.
[01:28:54.573 --> 01:28:55.213]  I totally agree with you.
[01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:55.713]  That's a great point.
[01:28:56.234 --> 01:28:59.756]  Because believe me, folks, you don't think I don't get pissed and lose hair over this and just get upset?
[01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:00.976]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:29:01.617 --> 01:29:02.537]  This is ridiculous.
[01:29:02.557 --> 01:29:08.161]  All right, back in 60 seconds, and I'm going directly to Kirk, Captain Kirk.
[01:29:08.961 --> 01:29:10.922]  And then we're going to go to everybody else.
[01:29:11.022 --> 01:29:11.923]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:29:12.323 --> 01:29:13.163]  We got three Carls.
[01:29:13.243 --> 01:29:15.505]  Carl in Kansas, Carl in Austin, and Carl in San Antonio.
[01:29:16.783 --> 01:29:17.964]  So we got two Carl's of Texas.
[01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:22.726]  That's, this is, have like three cherries on the, on the slot machine here.
[01:29:22.786 --> 01:29:26.148]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:26.168 --> 01:29:28.469]  Ah, Chinese Dragon here, America.
[01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:34.712]  We do anal swab to you, State Department, and you got much less to do here.
[01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:37.854]  Oh, you follow orders well.
[01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:51.474]  Your president controlled by us, nuclear code now give to Pelosi, and swallows well.
[01:29:51.874 --> 01:29:53.335]  Here you go, State Department.
[01:29:54.275 --> 01:29:56.216]  Oh, right in your boot boot, ah.
[01:29:56.236 --> 01:30:00.298]  Oh, do well for you.
[01:30:04.073 --> 01:30:05.615]  He just joined us, I'm not joking.
[01:30:06.576 --> 01:30:21.771]  China confirms they did it, and now the State Department says it's an accident, and China says we'll only do it to US citizens, we will not do it to lords of the Communist Party.
[01:30:22.812 --> 01:30:27.897]  China claims COVID anal swabs administered to the US State Department in error.
[01:30:31.235 --> 01:30:34.218]  Oh, I gotta Fentanyl the Dragon has to make a return with an anal swab.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:40.706]  Oh, President Biden, give me new clothes or I anal swab you.
[01:30:40.726 --> 01:30:42.187]  Uh-oh.
[01:30:42.928 --> 01:30:43.649]  Come on, man.
[01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:47.233]  I'm sorry, I can't handle it anymore.
[01:30:47.994 --> 01:30:48.554]  Woo!
[01:30:48.975 --> 01:30:51.398]  Into hour number three, baby.
[01:30:52.671 --> 01:30:56.633]  Got a bunch of calls to get to and I got Rand Paul just annihilated.
[01:30:57.173 --> 01:31:00.995]  That weird fat pot belly dude with a weird curly wig on.
[01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:06.337]  We're supposed to bow down to because he's a man becoming a woman who wants to sexually mutilate children.
[01:31:06.437 --> 01:31:08.098]  Seriously, I want to mutilate children.
[01:31:08.118 --> 01:31:09.878]  I'm a creepy looking fat dude with a wig on.
[01:31:10.139 --> 01:31:10.839]  Oh my God!
[01:31:11.039 --> 01:31:12.339]  Let's make you God!
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.241]  You want to have access to our children and cut their genitals off?
[01:31:15.421 --> 01:31:16.721]  Well my God, you're wonderful.
[01:31:18.442 --> 01:31:20.203]  Jeffrey Dahmer should be getting her job.
[01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.781]  Creepazoid, folks!
[01:31:24.322 --> 01:31:28.002]  He put out a report, it put out a report about safe orgies.
[01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.723]  Yeah, let's have, let's orgy with this.
[01:31:33.984 --> 01:31:34.744]  I mean, wow.
[01:31:35.164 --> 01:31:35.864]  Wow!
[01:31:35.884 --> 01:31:37.764]  If you'll accept that like a creepy dude in a wig.
[01:31:38.045 --> 01:31:39.745]  Give me access to your children's genitals.
[01:31:40.085 --> 01:31:40.725]  I'm liberal.
[01:31:41.265 --> 01:31:42.685]  Give me access now!
[01:31:43.046 --> 01:31:44.346]  Give me access now!
[01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:46.266]  But that's coming up next segment.
[01:31:46.286 --> 01:31:46.946]  Let's go ahead.
[01:31:48.187 --> 01:31:49.507]  Let's get to the Carl's here.
[01:31:52.585 --> 01:31:54.806]  Let's go to Carl in Kansas.
[01:31:54.867 --> 01:31:55.627]  Carl, go ahead.
[01:31:57.688 --> 01:31:59.330]  Hey, uh, Alex, it's Carl.
[01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:03.192]  Uh, I'm a truck driver out here, and actually I'm from Georgia.
[01:32:03.272 --> 01:32:04.973]  The location right now, I'm in Kansas.
[01:32:05.093 --> 01:32:08.576]  You're not the health secretary that wants to chop children's genitals off?
[01:32:11.263 --> 01:32:15.484]  No, but... That's not a very good profession, actually delivering things people need!
[01:32:16.164 --> 01:32:22.486]  Why don't you get in the business of wearing a wig and give us speeches about how you want to get involved with our children's genitals, Carl?
[01:32:23.886 --> 01:32:24.606]  Oh, hell.
[01:32:24.907 --> 01:32:25.827]  Sorry, I apologize.
[01:32:25.847 --> 01:32:27.847]  See, because you're a racist, okay?
[01:32:28.287 --> 01:32:29.808]  You're not thinking about children's genitals.
[01:32:29.848 --> 01:32:30.808]  That's your first problem.
[01:32:31.608 --> 01:32:34.709]  Start thinking like President Smell-Me-You-Well.
[01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:36.430]  Sorry, I'm going to stop, sir.
[01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.110]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:32:37.530 --> 01:32:38.110]  You're a truck driver.
[01:32:39.378 --> 01:32:42.339]  I'm too white, see, so, you know, I go right there with Coca-Cola.
[01:32:42.519 --> 01:32:46.540]  Well, it's okay if you're white and you wear a wig and say you're a woman and you're obsessed with children's genitals.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:47.701]  Then it's fine.
[01:32:47.841 --> 01:32:59.524]  Well, see, since everything is going so anal, why not they just get the codes and have them imprinted in their anuses, each one of them have one of the code numbers, and that way they can determine which order they have to go in.
[01:33:00.164 --> 01:33:02.425]  And the Deputy Health Secretary can oversee it.
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:04.120]  There you go.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:09.343]  It's totally normal to have a weird dude in a wig that wants to chop children's genitals off speaking to your kindergarten class.
[01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:14.145]  Totally normal.
[01:33:15.266 --> 01:33:18.107]  You guys are having conversations about what we should do.
[01:33:18.227 --> 01:33:19.768]  Everybody's saying what we should do.
[01:33:20.068 --> 01:33:22.530]  Why don't we act upon what was already talked about?
[01:33:23.210 --> 01:33:29.553]  You're talking about states that can succeed, not succeed, but recall in the office of their state.
[01:33:29.633 --> 01:33:31.094]  I looked up the site.
[01:33:32.052 --> 01:33:34.073]  N-C-S-L dot org.
[01:33:36.935 --> 01:33:37.835]  So we can pull that one.
[01:33:55.613 --> 01:33:58.875]  Let's go ahead and talk to another Carl in Austin.
[01:33:59.255 --> 01:34:01.516]  Carl in Austin, then Carl in San Antonio.
[01:34:01.556 --> 01:34:02.097]  Go ahead, Carl.
[01:34:03.057 --> 01:34:03.898]  Hey, brother.
[01:34:03.918 --> 01:34:05.679]  So good to talk to you.
[01:34:06.399 --> 01:34:07.300]  I appreciate you.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:07.700]  Go ahead.
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.361]  Red Pill since 1996.
[01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:13.563]  Kevin Trudeau turned me on to you through his book.
[01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:17.528]  Turn my world upside down, dude.
[01:34:18.688 --> 01:34:21.370]  Yeah, the media attacked me for saying Kevin Hurtado didn't deserve to go to prison.
[01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:24.173]  He wrote a book about herbs that are known to help people.
[01:34:24.553 --> 01:34:26.214]  And last time I heard it, I think he's still in prison.
[01:34:27.555 --> 01:34:27.815]  Wow.
[01:34:30.037 --> 01:34:33.760]  So I think this is a setup on the nuke codes.
[01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:38.703]  And I think the reason they have to announce it is so that they can vote for it.
[01:34:39.844 --> 01:34:41.045]  And just check this out.
[01:34:41.145 --> 01:34:43.287]  So if they give the nuke codes,
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:55.719]  So when they're not supposed to be and nobody can make a decision, if we get lightly hit with a four or five nuke strike, we would absorb it because we couldn't respond because they couldn't get it together.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.380]  Oh, that's the whole point.
[01:34:57.481 --> 01:34:59.382]  And we deserve it because we're racist too.
[01:35:00.563 --> 01:35:09.030]  So if they hit us with a light strike, maybe quote unquote here in Texas, guess what they could do as a UN?
[01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:13.193]  They could offer us humanitarian support.
[01:35:15.239 --> 01:35:18.300]  And that could help get Blue Helmet on the ground.
[01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:22.161]  What do you think about that?
[01:35:22.581 --> 01:35:25.362]  Sir, I mean, listen, I always go with my gut.
[01:35:25.822 --> 01:35:29.023]  I intellectually study things, but my gut is the subconscious is way more powerful.
[01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:31.044]  Hundreds of times more powerful than the conscious.
[01:35:31.104 --> 01:35:33.845]  And my gut is they're going to get the codes from Biden.
[01:35:34.912 --> 01:35:38.875]  And they're thinking about doing a first strike to decapitate us to make us surrender.
[01:35:39.135 --> 01:35:41.617]  I told the crew that last Monday in the studio.
[01:35:42.378 --> 01:35:43.439]  Crew, did I not tell you that?
[01:35:44.059 --> 01:35:45.781]  And then sure as hell, that's what's in the news right now.
[01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:46.441]  I appreciate your call.
[01:35:46.461 --> 01:35:47.001]  Good to hear from you.
[01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:47.322]  Carl.
[01:35:47.782 --> 01:35:51.805]  Another Carl in San Antonio, Texas, another great city.
[01:35:52.566 --> 01:35:53.887]  Army vet on corruption.
[01:35:53.927 --> 01:35:54.287]  Go ahead.
[01:35:54.507 --> 01:35:54.748]  Yeah.
[01:35:54.928 --> 01:35:55.528]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:56.709 --> 01:36:03.995]  Hey, the real problem is the attack against the American model and the American values that we've had.
[01:36:04.721 --> 01:36:05.602]  It's been so good to us.
[01:36:05.702 --> 01:36:07.903]  Corruption is the other big piece.
[01:36:08.463 --> 01:36:08.944]  No, but you're right.
[01:36:08.984 --> 01:36:11.805]  They're attacking the American model because it competes with their globalist model.
[01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:12.786]  Absolutely.
[01:36:12.946 --> 01:36:14.767]  And the globalists have an agenda.
[01:36:14.787 --> 01:36:16.048]  It's very comprehensive.
[01:36:16.088 --> 01:36:17.689]  They've been working on it a long time.
[01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:25.374]  And either they've got people in the CIA and in Congress, or they work on co-opting them.
[01:36:26.135 --> 01:36:27.996]  You know, we have laws in this country.
[01:36:28.336 --> 01:36:31.218]  And why the FBI, I guess they got into them too.
[01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:37.875]  If we can get into the FBI and get patriots in there, because they're going to have their
[01:36:38.382 --> 01:36:41.383]  They're tentacles and everything in the country.
[01:36:41.423 --> 01:36:43.644]  Plus, they've got visibility on them.
[01:36:43.664 --> 01:36:45.105]  Well, I'll tell you how it works in the FBI.
[01:36:45.225 --> 01:36:46.626]  I've been told this by a high-level FBI.
[01:36:47.186 --> 01:36:48.427]  You've been in the FBI five years.
[01:36:48.447 --> 01:36:49.487]  You're doing bank robberies.
[01:36:49.507 --> 01:36:51.788]  You're doing kidnappings, real work, you know, stuff everywhere.
[01:36:51.828 --> 01:36:53.369]  You're doing, like, copyright stuff, everything.
[01:36:54.029 --> 01:36:55.430]  Pretty soon, you're in a hotel at a party.
[01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:57.471]  If you don't have sex with a hooker, you don't advance.
[01:36:57.871 --> 01:36:59.172]  Then it's a 16-year-old girl.
[01:36:59.352 --> 01:36:59.792]  Don't do it.
[01:36:59.832 --> 01:37:00.312]  You don't advance.
[01:37:00.532 --> 01:37:03.033]  And the guys know, I don't have sex with a 16-year-old.
[01:37:03.053 --> 01:37:03.834]  Well, you're not in the club.
[01:37:04.674 --> 01:37:06.195]  Next it's do a drug deal, whatever.
[01:37:06.255 --> 01:37:10.618]  And so you have the white hat FBI and the black hat FBI.
[01:37:10.998 --> 01:37:13.200]  And the black hat FBI runs the show.
[01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:15.802]  And so that's basically it.
[01:37:15.822 --> 01:37:18.083]  And then you've got the gay mafia and the FBI, all of it.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:19.584]  So it's just a big mess.
[01:37:23.447 --> 01:37:24.748]  We know he had some problems.
[01:37:25.268 --> 01:37:28.410]  I almost hate to ask you this question about Steve Pucinich.
[01:37:29.803 --> 01:37:32.052]  How could he be so wrong about everything?
[01:37:32.172 --> 01:37:35.584]  And it seemed like those Boogaloo Boys had his fingerprints all over it.
[01:37:36.052 --> 01:37:38.834]  You know, just because he wears Hawaiian shirts, I don't think he's a boogaloo boy.
[01:37:39.114 --> 01:37:46.879]  Steve's said a lot of true things over the years, and I think he wanted to believe positive stuff, and I don't think he is, like, jacked into... I mean, so what if you're jacked into the CIA?
[01:37:46.899 --> 01:37:48.520]  So what if you're jacked into the military?
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.601]  Those guys don't know what's going on.
[01:37:49.901 --> 01:37:50.401]  Nobody knows.
[01:37:50.441 --> 01:37:51.262]  It's all out of control.
[01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:53.844]  You know, there's basic movements in humanity.
[01:37:53.884 --> 01:37:57.526]  Movements of freedom, movements of tyranny, and you gotta know who the different players are.
[01:37:58.267 --> 01:38:04.711]  But at least Pachinick had the nerve to come on and defend himself when what he said was gonna happen didn't happen, right?
[01:38:06.095 --> 01:38:07.096]  I don't think you have.
[01:38:25.856 --> 01:38:30.019]  Too many senior leaders that are honest you could depend on.
[01:38:30.139 --> 01:38:36.622]  I don't want to lionize the military, but on average, compared to corporate America and the lawyers, the lawyers are scum.
[01:38:37.163 --> 01:38:39.604]  They're just lying, lazy, dumb scum.
[01:38:39.904 --> 01:38:40.124]  Right.
[01:38:40.605 --> 01:38:43.006]  And they're the ones that want control of the nukes right now.
[01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:45.207]  The Attorney General wants the nukes.
[01:38:45.468 --> 01:38:46.328]  How could that go bad?
[01:38:47.789 --> 01:38:49.250]  They're trying to take over.
[01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.970]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.611]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:50.971 --> 01:38:52.412]  All right, I got to all three Carl's.
[01:38:53.581 --> 01:39:06.232]  Now I've got the Rand Paul opening statement that was powerful to the fat dude in a wig in chief who says, I want federal funding to chop five-year-olds' penises off.
[01:39:06.352 --> 01:39:07.753]  I'm sorry to use that word, it's what he wants.
[01:39:08.293 --> 01:39:13.277]  He wants to have the state come in, take kids away from parents, and chop those genitals off.
[01:39:13.998 --> 01:39:16.240]  He's like a lawnmower coming for your son's genitals.
[01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:18.462]  He's wearing a wig though, so it's okay.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.160]  We are back live at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:33.743]  Well, Rachel Levine is the Deputy Head of Health and Human Services, and because it's a dude wearing an ugly, curly wig, we're supposed to just go, whoa, this is God!
[01:39:35.184 --> 01:39:38.284]  You got yellow teeth, you look like a psycho, like the Penguin.
[01:39:38.604 --> 01:39:41.025]  You're ready to star in the new Batman movie as the Penguin.
[01:39:41.405 --> 01:39:42.405]  I better bow down to you.
[01:39:42.785 --> 01:39:49.407]  But hey, if you want to cut your genitals off, as, I mean, I'm a libertarian, as long as I don't have to pay for a taxpayer money, I mean, you're okay, whatever.
[01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:51.931]  My God, was that him before?
[01:39:51.951 --> 01:39:55.833]  It's kind of like, who's that white lady that said she was black?
[01:39:58.335 --> 01:40:01.677]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:40:01.717 --> 01:40:04.819]  Was that a real picture of him before he did that curly wig?
[01:40:04.839 --> 01:40:05.280]  Was that real?
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.161]  Or was that somebody else?
[01:40:07.721 --> 01:40:08.162]  That was real.
[01:40:08.182 --> 01:40:08.662]  Oh my God.
[01:40:09.783 --> 01:40:11.184]  How do I advance the top of government?
[01:40:11.204 --> 01:40:12.364]  Well, I'll just grow a wig.
[01:40:12.985 --> 01:40:18.949]  I don't know if like Bruce Jenner, who refused to cut his genitals off for publicity,
[01:40:20.478 --> 01:40:23.219]  I don't know if this dude cut his off or not, but here's the deal.
[01:40:23.619 --> 01:40:27.180]  He's out there giving speeches about, we need to get little boys' genitals.
[01:40:27.561 --> 01:40:28.801]  Hey, I don't care who you are!
[01:40:29.061 --> 01:40:30.782]  Stop talking about little boys' genitals!
[01:40:31.122 --> 01:40:33.003]  The school shouldn't be about little boys' genitals!
[01:40:33.463 --> 01:40:37.024]  But that's how far we've gone with this cult of mad scientists.
[01:40:37.044 --> 01:40:44.347]  So here's Mr. Pervert Potato Head, is his real name, being grilled by Dr. Rand Paul just hours ago.
[01:40:45.735 --> 01:40:49.077]  Genital mutilation has been nearly universally condemned.
[01:40:49.557 --> 01:40:56.742]  Genital mutilation has been condemned by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund.
[01:40:57.422 --> 01:41:03.486]  According to the WHO, genital mutilation is recognized internationally as a violation of human rights.
[01:41:04.286 --> 01:41:13.732]  Genital mutilation is considered particularly egregious because, as the WHO notes, it is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children.
[01:41:14.573 --> 01:41:32.885]  Most genital mutilation is not typically performed by force, but as WHO notes, that by social convention, social norm, the social pressure to conform, to do what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community, American culture
[01:41:33.806 --> 01:41:40.712]  Is now normalizing the idea that minors can be given hormones to prevent their biological development of their secondary sexual characteristics.
[01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:52.021]  Dr. Levine, you have supported both allowing minors to be given hormone blockers to prevent them from going through puberty as well as surgical destruction of a minor's genitalia.
[01:41:53.897 --> 01:41:59.981]  Like surgical mutilation, hormonal interruption of puberty can permanently alter and prevent secondary sexual characteristics.
[01:42:00.762 --> 01:42:16.073]  The American College of Pediatricians reports that 80 to 95 percent of prepubertal children with gender dysphoria will experience resolution by late adolescence if not exposed to medical intervention and social affirmation.
[01:42:17.093 --> 01:42:23.078]  Dr. Levine, do you believe that minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one's sex?
[01:42:24.775 --> 01:42:27.356]  Well, Senator, thank you for your interest in this question.
[01:42:27.716 --> 01:42:36.979]  Transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care that have been developed.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:49.664]  And if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as the Assistant Secretary of Health, I will look forward to working with you and your office and coming to your office and discussing the particulars of the standards of care for transgender medicine.
[01:42:49.824 --> 01:42:51.645]  The specific question was about minors.
[01:42:51.705 --> 01:42:54.185]  Let's be a little more specific since you evaded the question.
[01:42:54.605 --> 01:43:06.069]  Do you support the government intervening to override the parents' consent to give a child puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and or amputation surgery of breasts and genitalia?
[01:43:06.549 --> 01:43:11.230]  You have said that you're willing to accelerate the protocols for street kids.
[01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:16.032]  I'm alarmed that poor kids with no parents who are homeless and distraught
[01:43:16.812 --> 01:43:20.416]  You would just go through this and allow that to happen to a minor.
[01:43:20.997 --> 01:43:27.804]  I would hope that you would have compassion for Kyra Bell, who's a 23-year-old girl who was confused with her identity.
[01:43:28.525 --> 01:43:31.628]  At 14, she read on the internet about something about transsexuals.
[01:43:31.668 --> 01:43:33.250]  She thought, well, maybe that's what I am.
[01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:36.633]  She ended up getting these puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones.
[01:43:36.874 --> 01:43:38.315]  She had her breasts amputated.
[01:43:39.116 --> 01:43:48.162]  But here's what ultimately she says now, and this is a very insightful decision from someone who made a mistake, but was led to believe this was a good thing by the medical community.
[01:43:48.722 --> 01:44:02.011]  I made a brash decision as a teenager, as a lot of teenagers do, trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected, she said, adding that the medicalized gender transitioning
[01:44:02.771 --> 01:44:07.474]  With a very temporary superficial fix for a very complex identity issue.
[01:44:08.115 --> 01:44:16.941]  What I'm alarmed at is that you're not willing to say absolutely minors shouldn't be making decisions to amputate their breast or to amputate their genitalia.
[01:44:18.442 --> 01:44:23.106]  For most of our history, we have believed that minors don't have full rights and the parents need to be involved.
[01:44:23.527 --> 01:44:32.936]  So, I'm alarmed that you won't say with certainty that minors should not have the ability to make... I'm gonna play the rest of this, but this is a literal cult leader!
[01:44:34.343 --> 01:45:01.310]  With a whole out-of-control medical system with mRNA and checkpoints and anti-human tyranny that wants to end the human system as it's known, bring in cyborgs, and they know if we'll accept our young boys who are mentally ill, who are autistic, who are street children, that's what the British government admits, half the kids over there are autistic, and they come to a little autistic boy and say, aren't you pretty, you're really a girl, and the teacher gets them to sign a paper when they're nine years old, and they go chop their testicles off.
[01:45:02.486 --> 01:45:05.648]  And then a weird ghoul, like this monster, is a high priest over it.
[01:45:06.028 --> 01:45:08.010]  This is just such a crime against humanity.
[01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:11.372]  It's literal amputation of girls' breasts.
[01:45:12.273 --> 01:45:14.835]  Their beautiful breasts that God gave them that feed babies.
[01:45:15.095 --> 01:45:16.035]  Oh, you're not a girl!
[01:45:16.256 --> 01:45:17.977]  We're gonna chop your breast off!
[01:45:18.477 --> 01:45:19.478]  You're not a boy!
[01:45:19.718 --> 01:45:23.961]  We're- you're gonna chop your gen- And now they're like, oh, it's not enough to chop their testicles off when they're nine.
[01:45:24.682 --> 01:45:26.042]  We want to chop them off when they're three.
[01:45:27.452 --> 01:45:28.873]  Just have a little kid on an iPad.
[01:45:28.953 --> 01:45:29.193]  Click.
[01:45:29.313 --> 01:45:30.053]  I want to be a girl.
[01:45:30.113 --> 01:45:30.974]  Give them a lollipop.
[01:45:31.054 --> 01:45:31.814]  Oh, you want to be a girl?
[01:45:31.834 --> 01:45:33.495]  We're going to chop your test.
[01:45:34.336 --> 01:45:35.336]  This is a ghoul.
[01:45:35.936 --> 01:45:36.637]  Call them out.
[01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.258]  These are monsters.
[01:45:38.318 --> 01:45:40.139]  These are beyond child molesters.
[01:45:40.159 --> 01:45:41.499]  They don't want to just have sex with your children.
[01:45:41.659 --> 01:45:48.143]  They want to mutilate them and chop their future off and wreck their future and steal their essence and their will!
[01:45:48.883 --> 01:45:49.984]  Complete the video!
[01:45:51.912 --> 01:46:00.858]  I'm alarmed that you won't say with certainty that minors should not have the ability to make the decision to take hormones that will affect them for the rest of their life.
[01:46:01.859 --> 01:46:06.843]  Will you make a more firm decision on whether or not minors should be involved in these decisions?
[01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:23.643]  Senator, transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field, and if confirmed to the position of Assistant Secretary of Health, I would certainly be pleased to come to your office and talk to you and your staff about the standards of care and the complexity of this field.
[01:46:23.723 --> 01:46:28.206]  Let it go into the record that the witness refused to answer the question.
[01:46:28.226 --> 01:46:30.768]  The question is a very specific one.
[01:46:30.808 --> 01:46:33.330]  Should minors be making these momentous decisions?
[01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:37.773]  For most of the history of medicine, we wouldn't let you have a cut sewn up in the ER.
[01:46:38.153 --> 01:46:43.257]  But you're willing to let a minor take things that prevent their puberty, and you think they get that back?
[01:46:43.857 --> 01:46:46.961]  You give a woman testosterone enough that she grows a beard?
[01:46:46.981 --> 01:46:50.004]  You think she's going to go back looking like a woman when you stop the testosterone?
[01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:52.346]  You have permanently changed them.
[01:46:52.807 --> 01:46:54.449]  Infertility is another problem.
[01:46:55.009 --> 01:46:56.591]  None of these drugs have been approved for this.
[01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:58.113]  They're all being used off-label.
[01:46:58.453 --> 01:47:04.920]  I find it ironic that the left is letting nuts over hydroxychloroquine being used possibly for COVID.
[01:47:05.481 --> 01:47:06.661]  There's a globalist or a mad scientist?
[01:47:28.672 --> 01:47:30.973]  Ten percent of the kids are between the ages of three and ten!
[01:47:30.993 --> 01:47:36.136]  We should be outraged that someone's talking to a three-year-old about changing their sex!
[01:47:37.877 --> 01:47:39.918]  I can't vote for you if you can't vote for me.
[01:47:39.998 --> 01:47:41.759]  Thank you so much, Senator Paula.
[01:47:41.839 --> 01:47:44.421]  I pray to God for judgment on these people!
[01:47:45.455 --> 01:47:49.998]  Folks, you better choose a side, because God's gonna destroy anybody that does stuff like this.
[01:47:50.879 --> 01:47:54.602]  New World Order, FBI, you don't gotta worry about me, you gotta worry about God of the Universe.
[01:47:55.282 --> 01:48:01.847]  All of you that serve this system, that think you threaten me, you think you scare me, I'm scared of the Creator, and I'm with Him forever.
[01:48:02.247 --> 01:48:05.050]  I'm committed, I'm free, and I am winning.
[01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:09.373]  Alright, I got to a lot of calls, sorry to the full board, I didn't get to some of you.
[01:48:10.814 --> 01:48:12.154]  We're going to get your name and number if you want.
[01:48:12.174 --> 01:48:12.815]  I'll call you back tomorrow.
[01:48:12.835 --> 01:48:13.435]  We'll take your calls.
[01:48:13.895 --> 01:48:15.055]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:48:15.635 --> 01:48:17.756]  Well, I was on Kevin Schoolcheck's show.
[01:48:18.136 --> 01:48:19.196]  Thought it was pretty informative.
[01:48:19.216 --> 01:48:21.297]  Wanted to get him to pop in on the broadcast with us.
[01:48:21.677 --> 01:48:23.778]  He's the host of News Rocky.
[01:48:24.218 --> 01:48:32.080]  He's a retired correctional officer and state of Connecticut, former first selectman of the town of Gristwood and former Connecticut representative, 45th District.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.781]  He has owned and co-owned several businesses, including Pub 45 and Field
[01:48:38.444 --> 01:48:39.104]  How do you say that?
[01:48:39.184 --> 01:48:39.805]  Tranquility.
[01:48:40.105 --> 01:48:41.346]  I like that name, like on the moon.
[01:48:41.726 --> 01:48:44.907]  Kevin has had a passion for politics and radio since he was a child.
[01:48:45.348 --> 01:48:48.189]  Hosting the News Rocky podcast is his dream job.
[01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:50.710]  At News Rocky on Facebook for now.
[01:48:51.171 --> 01:48:53.052]  But he's on with us and I wanted to get into...
[01:48:54.406 --> 01:48:55.527]  A host of subjects with him.
[01:48:55.928 --> 01:48:58.050]  Coronavirus and our Lord and Savior Fauci.
[01:48:58.611 --> 01:49:00.193]  Biden's push for reparations.
[01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:03.076]  How black and tan Americans will save the Second Amendment.
[01:49:03.497 --> 01:49:04.338]  The future of the GOP.
[01:49:04.358 --> 01:49:05.579]  The Las Vegas shooting.
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:06.821]  Why is the case closed?
[01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:07.942]  Or is it closed?
[01:49:08.583 --> 01:49:09.985]  Great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:49:11.355 --> 01:49:13.739]  Alex, great to be with you today.
[01:49:13.799 --> 01:49:15.561]  I'm so excited to be on your show.
[01:49:15.862 --> 01:49:16.442]  Thank you, brother.
[01:49:16.603 --> 01:49:17.424]  I'm excited to have you here.
[01:49:17.464 --> 01:49:18.425]  I want to get you on our other shows.
[01:49:18.445 --> 01:49:19.286]  You're a great talk show host.
[01:49:19.587 --> 01:49:25.155]  Hey, first off, what do you make of Pelosi wanting the nuclear code, saying Biden's got the 25th Amendment problem?
[01:49:25.175 --> 01:49:25.795]  This is crazy.
[01:49:26.036 --> 01:49:28.019]  I thought they'd wait a while before they made their move on Biden.
[01:49:29.282 --> 01:49:31.024]  Listen, brother, there's no time to waste.
[01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:35.688]  I mean, listen, we don't even know how long Joe Biden's gonna make it physically, health-wise.
[01:49:36.009 --> 01:49:38.751]  There's no doubt that this plan was pre-organized.
[01:49:38.811 --> 01:49:39.252]  We know it.
[01:49:39.292 --> 01:49:41.774]  You talk about it every day on your show, and we do the same thing.
[01:49:42.134 --> 01:49:49.241]  This is just the ultimate plan for this total control by this Democratic control, Pelosi, Schumer, and the rest of the clowns down there in Washington, D.C.
[01:49:50.622 --> 01:49:52.985]  What would you call this period of time we're living in right now?
[01:49:54.352 --> 01:49:54.712]  Scary.
[01:49:55.332 --> 01:49:58.413]  It's actually the scariest time to be alive and be in America.
[01:49:58.693 --> 01:50:01.374]  I think this is scarier than any time ever, because you know what?
[01:50:01.714 --> 01:50:14.397]  When you're losing your First Amendment right, what you've been going through as a host, what Donald Trump, the former president, went through, when they've denied access for platforms to control the narrative, and they're coming after our guns, Alex.
[01:50:14.737 --> 01:50:16.177]  This is a crazy time, brother.
[01:50:16.197 --> 01:50:18.438]  I totally agree with you.
[01:50:18.498 --> 01:50:21.759]  Now they're saying you can't criticize NATO on Twitter.
[01:50:21.839 --> 01:50:22.919]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:24.421]  You know what, Alex?
[01:50:24.621 --> 01:50:30.190]  I just did a special episode of the attacks of NATO on the Serbian people.
[01:50:30.785 --> 01:50:32.646]  You know, we're going to have the topic here.
[01:50:32.666 --> 01:50:33.366]  We can talk about it.
[01:50:33.446 --> 01:50:34.907]  No, let's get into that, because here's the deal.
[01:50:35.547 --> 01:50:37.228]  I'm not a Serbophile.
[01:50:37.668 --> 01:50:39.449]  I don't have any Eastern European blood in me.
[01:50:39.469 --> 01:50:40.089]  They're great people.
[01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:45.091]  But, I mean, looking and studying that, they admitted that the U.N.
[01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:47.792]  had to admit that double the number of Serbs died as other groups.
[01:50:48.073 --> 01:50:52.855]  They admitted that the Muslims started the war, but then Clinton went in and bombed Belgrade with D.U.
[01:50:52.915 --> 01:50:54.055]  and took over Pristina and all that.
[01:50:54.475 --> 01:50:59.838]  Literally, the war criminals were the outsiders, but then they killed Slobodan Milosevic inside the Hague.
[01:51:00.754 --> 01:51:03.375]  It wasn't just Bill Clinton, the president of the United States in 1999.
[01:51:03.735 --> 01:51:07.236]  It was also our president today, Joe Biden.
[01:51:07.556 --> 01:51:09.697]  He was the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[01:51:10.057 --> 01:51:12.198]  He actually went and orchestrated this plan.
[01:51:12.238 --> 01:51:17.439]  And today, I talked to a Serbian resident who lived through it at 11 years old.
[01:51:17.499 --> 01:51:18.400]  She shared her story.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.381]  It's going to be on next week on a two-part series on News Rocky.
[01:51:21.681 --> 01:51:27.062]  I'm going to tell you, Alex, there's a lot of answers that need to be offered by the government here in this United States.
[01:51:27.263 --> 01:51:28.723]  That was a major war crime.
[01:51:28.843 --> 01:51:34.048]  And what do you think of Biden now saying, we need to let China take over Hong Kong and let China run death camps?
[01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:35.329]  Are you kidding?
[01:51:35.349 --> 01:51:36.790]  This is the, here we go, right?
[01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:38.972]  This is what happens each and every time.
[01:51:39.352 --> 01:51:43.516]  Joe Biden is just another talking piece for the Democratic control party.
[01:51:43.816 --> 01:51:48.440]  They are looking to try to, now look at Alex, no wars in four years under the former president.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:49.541]  Zero wars.
[01:51:50.214 --> 01:51:52.055]  We now are facing Iran.
[01:51:52.475 --> 01:51:58.797]  These are the conversations that the government, wag the dog government, that's what I call it, wag the dog government in Washington, D.C.
[01:51:58.817 --> 01:51:59.437]  They want this.
[01:51:59.457 --> 01:52:00.778]  I agree.
[01:52:01.158 --> 01:52:07.180]  What about the domestic front, the troops at the Capitol, and Senator Leahy saying the troops don't leave until they rout out the patriots?
[01:52:08.168 --> 01:52:13.452]  We are now in a military zone, and the military is going to be there.
[01:52:13.492 --> 01:52:14.793]  We know it's not going away, right?
[01:52:14.813 --> 01:52:27.363]  You know we're going to see, when we want to bring our kids down and our children to show them what Washington DC is like, we're going to have to go through each little military stop because that's the government that these politicians in Washington DC, they want it, Alex.
[01:52:27.383 --> 01:52:29.525]  They want to deny us our country and our rights.
[01:52:29.545 --> 01:52:29.905]  That's right.
[01:52:30.045 --> 01:52:34.549]  Everything is now a little martial law checkpoint programming point.
[01:52:35.555 --> 01:52:36.115]  That's amazing.
[01:52:36.155 --> 01:52:38.056]  And listen, Alex, you were down there, right?
[01:52:38.116 --> 01:52:40.217]  And you were down there for the gathering.
[01:52:40.737 --> 01:52:42.978]  You participated, exercised your First Amendment rights.
[01:52:43.258 --> 01:52:49.841]  Look at the attacks on the good American people who are out exercising their American rights, their rights as a First Amendment in this country.
[01:52:49.861 --> 01:52:53.822]  Oh yeah, we had a million people out there, maybe 200 broke in, maybe 50 were violent.
[01:52:54.343 --> 01:52:56.503]  One guy pooped on the walls, no one's endorsing that.
[01:52:58.224 --> 01:53:00.045]  But literally, it was four citizens were killed.
[01:53:00.065 --> 01:53:04.629]  Now the mother of the cop that got killed said he died of an aneurysm.
[01:53:04.689 --> 01:53:05.990]  He was never hit in the head.
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:06.690]  It was all a lie.
[01:53:08.111 --> 01:53:08.531]  Is that true?
[01:53:08.551 --> 01:53:09.312]  I haven't seen that.
[01:53:09.352 --> 01:53:15.356]  And to be honest with you, that's something that's great concerning for all Americans because the lies that keep on coming out through the corporate media.
[01:53:15.616 --> 01:53:17.138]  We know you fight it every day, Alex.
[01:53:17.198 --> 01:53:18.438]  I'm just getting in this industry.
[01:53:18.719 --> 01:53:25.123]  And I can tell you right from the beginning, I'm fighting each and every day to fight against fake news, fake corporate media.
[01:53:25.183 --> 01:53:27.365]  Each and every day, they want to deny us to tell the truth.
[01:53:28.547 --> 01:53:29.689]  What about civil war?
[01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:30.992]  Pelosi wants a civil war.
[01:53:31.152 --> 01:53:31.854]  I don't want violence.
[01:53:31.874 --> 01:53:33.056]  I think the Communist Chinese do.
[01:53:33.316 --> 01:53:35.441]  They're claiming I want violence or others want violence.
[01:53:36.563 --> 01:53:37.885]  What do you think the Democrats want?
[01:53:38.857 --> 01:53:44.439]  Listen, what's a better distraction than following the bouncing ball, right?
[01:53:44.679 --> 01:53:45.420]  This is all it is.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.840]  This is typical politics.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.741]  I sat in a seat at the State House in Hartford, Connecticut here.
[01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:51.142]  I was a state representative.
[01:53:51.482 --> 01:53:56.024]  Nothing helps with politicians that pass their own policies through than create some kind of diversion.
[01:53:56.264 --> 01:53:59.045]  This is all diversion tactics, and that's what Washington, D.C.
[01:53:59.085 --> 01:53:59.705]  insiders know.
[01:53:59.985 --> 01:54:00.425]  You know that.
[01:54:00.505 --> 01:54:01.546]  Alex has happened every day.
[01:54:03.015 --> 01:54:04.777]  Yeah, the way to kill a story is with another story.
[01:54:05.337 --> 01:54:12.484]  So, looking at their attempts at racial division and the Coca-Cola training videos saying whiteness is evil, get rid of it.
[01:54:13.105 --> 01:54:14.326]  Nickelodeon saying that.
[01:54:15.307 --> 01:54:16.808]  Biden pushing reparations.
[01:54:17.389 --> 01:54:18.910]  Most of the population of the US
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:20.260]  Let's
[01:54:43.903 --> 01:54:44.243]  Anywhere.
[01:54:44.323 --> 01:54:47.304]  How do you charge them because they're white to give black people money?
[01:54:47.344 --> 01:54:49.064]  And obviously the government doesn't care about black people.
[01:54:49.324 --> 01:54:52.184]  It's this idea of the government taking from one group and giving to another.
[01:54:52.224 --> 01:54:52.845]  It's very dangerous.
[01:54:52.865 --> 01:54:55.785]  But it's total divide and conquer.
[01:54:55.805 --> 01:54:58.005]  It's like, oh, we love black people.
[01:54:58.626 --> 01:55:00.306]  We've got vaccines for you.
[01:55:00.546 --> 01:55:04.567]  And then I learned something yesterday that I'm not ready to get to today.
[01:55:04.587 --> 01:55:06.487]  I meant to do some research on it.
[01:55:06.507 --> 01:55:07.407]  I didn't have time to do it.
[01:55:08.507 --> 01:55:12.268]  But definitely black people are dying from COVID.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:13.820]  I think?
[01:55:24.244 --> 01:55:32.970]  With Shane Steiner, and I knew the guy, I had lunch with him a few times, barely knew him at school, but I knew his name when Shane told me, hey, did you hear such and such died?
[01:55:33.811 --> 01:55:48.142]  Yesterday, we went to lunch in his helicopter, he came and picked us up at the office, he flies around in a helicopter, he's a big helicopter pilot, we flew out to Salt Lake, had lunch out in Driftwood, and he said, hey, did you hear such and such died?
[01:55:48.162 --> 01:55:49.723]  And I said, of what?
[01:55:49.783 --> 01:55:50.223]  Of COVID.
[01:55:51.004 --> 01:55:52.285]  He goes, yeah, did you hear his wife died?
[01:55:54.255 --> 01:55:54.495]  I don't
[01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:18.512]  Again, we have our special guest Kevin Schoolcheck on with us.
[01:56:19.092 --> 01:56:23.575]  News Rocky is where you find him on Facebook and so much more, doing a great job.
[01:56:23.955 --> 01:56:32.320]  We'll get into Biden's reparations, how black and tan Americans can save the Second Amendment, the future of the GOP, Las Vegas shooting, is the case really closed?
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:36.922]  That's an important topic, and our Lord and Savior, who woke up and was God, Fauci.
[01:56:38.735 --> 01:56:41.736]  Never tried to run our lives, but people get mad if he did, I would do.
[01:56:42.036 --> 01:56:45.237]  But when it's Fauci and it's Bill Gates, we supposedly got to put up with it.
[01:56:45.257 --> 01:56:46.097]  So we're going to cover it all.
[01:56:46.237 --> 01:56:48.977]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:56:49.358 --> 01:56:52.278]  Remember, big tech is working around the clock to block those URLs.
[01:56:52.618 --> 01:56:54.519]  When you promote those URLs, it changes the world.
[01:56:55.039 --> 01:56:57.179]  So tomorrow's news today, Infowars.com.
[01:56:57.559 --> 01:56:58.760]  Only you can prevent tyranny.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.781]  You talk about getting down the devil's level.
[01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:10.433]  I read, just as I got into history, over 100 history books on World War II, but I read a lot of others.
[01:57:11.494 --> 01:57:23.102]  And I remember reading in two history books and not believing it, so I went down to the library and checked and confirmed that it had been reported in World War II that Hitler made sausages out of his own blood and had the top SS officers eat it.
[01:57:24.366 --> 01:57:27.988]  Hollywood's coming out with blood sausages made out of their blood.
[01:57:28.769 --> 01:57:31.950]  And before I read the article I went, they're going to get a few of their cells and grow it.
[01:57:32.031 --> 01:57:33.031]  Bill Gates is involved.
[01:57:33.051 --> 01:57:35.352]  Remember he said, you're not going to eat real meat anymore.
[01:57:36.073 --> 01:57:38.714]  So it's going to be celebrity steak.
[01:57:39.655 --> 01:57:44.238]  And the weird liberals are so weird, they'll be like, want to eat Brad Pitt T-bone.
[01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.159]  So it's cannibalism.
[01:57:48.931 --> 01:57:50.092]  I fought with the devil.
[01:57:50.212 --> 01:57:51.372]  I got down on his level.
[01:57:51.733 --> 01:57:54.674]  That just means you got to get down in the weeds inside their mindset, man.
[01:57:54.714 --> 01:57:56.735]  And I'll tell you, there's just no end to these people.
[01:57:57.456 --> 01:57:58.576]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[01:57:59.777 --> 01:58:01.117]  Laura Loomer is running for Congress again.
[01:58:01.177 --> 01:58:02.158]  Big announcement here in a moment.
[01:58:03.259 --> 01:58:05.580]  Kevin, school chick, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:06.260]  You join us again.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.661]  We got about 10 minutes left of this segment.
[01:58:08.361 --> 01:58:10.262]  Let's get into Biden reparations.
[01:58:10.302 --> 01:58:11.543]  That's something you've been covering big.
[01:58:12.483 --> 01:58:13.884]  Oh yeah, let me tell you something, Alex.
[01:58:13.924 --> 01:58:15.845]  This is something that concerns me, because you know what?
[01:58:15.885 --> 01:58:19.228]  The average American, this really isn't on the hydraulic reel.
[01:58:19.268 --> 01:58:28.414]  We know that the atrocities that took place, not just for the black Americans' ancestors, they want to call it, but you know, think about the Native Americans of this country.
[01:58:28.454 --> 01:58:30.915]  They're never talked about, but this is nonsense.
[01:58:30.955 --> 01:58:34.778]  Who's going to pay for the next generation of issues that we have to go and remedy with?
[01:58:35.098 --> 01:58:38.841]  You know, I just think this is a bunch of Washington, D.C.
[01:58:38.881 --> 01:58:42.283]  insider campaign promises, and they're going to continue to do this, Alex.
[01:58:43.564 --> 01:58:43.984]  I agree.
[01:58:44.024 --> 01:58:45.465]  Let's get into Las Vegas shooting.
[01:58:45.905 --> 01:58:48.707]  Man, they always hype up all the other shootings, but they don't want to talk about that one.
[01:58:49.527 --> 01:58:56.471]  Well, you know, Alex, I know you, listen, you're on to every topic going on in the world practically, but let's ask a real serious question.
[01:58:56.511 --> 01:59:00.054]  I believe they closed out this investigation back in 2018.
[01:59:00.394 --> 01:59:04.876]  When you look at the investigation, it seems like there was not a really a lot of clarity here.
[01:59:04.897 --> 01:59:07.158]  There was not a lot of open to this investigation.
[01:59:07.538 --> 01:59:16.567]  Now, how does someone take 300 plus pounds of ammunition and guns up, how many, 30 floors in a hotel room, disarm the security system?
[01:59:16.747 --> 01:59:18.269]  What's your best analysis?
[01:59:18.529 --> 01:59:21.452]  Because, I mean, we basically, from my view, we know what actually happened there.
[01:59:21.472 --> 01:59:21.873]  What's your view?
[01:59:22.932 --> 01:59:24.512]  Listen, this was an insider deal.
[01:59:24.552 --> 01:59:33.274]  This was somebody, listen, I'm a Second Amendment guy like you, and I think this is purely opportunity for people to push a narrative on the attack of the Second Amendment in this country.
[01:59:33.294 --> 01:59:41.436]  I also believe that this was, again, I refer to Wag the Dog a lot, Alex, the movie from 1997 or 87 with Dustin Hoffman in it.
[01:59:41.456 --> 01:59:44.997]  This is an attempt to control the narrative.
[01:59:45.037 --> 01:59:46.217]  They want to distract us.
[01:59:46.257 --> 01:59:47.757]  Let's be clear, I agree.
[01:59:48.037 --> 01:59:49.617]  We basically know what happened.
[01:59:49.637 --> 01:59:51.518]  You have the Saudi Arabians having a major
[01:59:52.472 --> 01:59:52.732]  Thank you.
[02:00:11.661 --> 02:00:33.988]  And the Wahhabis got shut down, so they set him up, he brought them the arms, then they used that to try to embarrass Trump, shoot everything up, but Trump figured it out, exposed him, rolled up the Al-Qaeda network, so that was really an extension of the war in Syria coming to America, and the Islamists are saying, we'll attack your casinos just like they do in Mumbai, and to the Indians and others if you don't submit to us, and so it was the right answer.
[02:00:34.048 --> 02:00:37.089]  Not a lot of coverage, go kill the Al-Qaeda people, and that's what happened.
[02:00:37.932 --> 02:00:39.933]  Just another cover-up in my opinion of Biden.
[02:00:39.993 --> 02:00:42.895]  No, it is a cover-up, but real terrorism you don't want to give attention to.
[02:00:43.395 --> 02:00:45.996]  So they just went in, took over Saudi Arabia, killed everybody involved.
[02:00:46.317 --> 02:00:50.839]  Remember, like they took over the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh and had guys hanging out.
[02:00:50.899 --> 02:00:52.300]  I'm not for torture and stuff, I'm just saying.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.942]  Trump went in and rolled up the Islamists for what they did in Las Vegas.
[02:00:56.502 --> 02:00:56.922]  Exactly.
[02:00:57.322 --> 02:00:57.722]  Exactly.
[02:00:57.842 --> 02:00:59.222]  So, you know, that's one topic.
[02:00:59.262 --> 02:01:00.183]  I mean, we've got a lot of stuff.
[02:01:00.223 --> 02:01:02.663]  And, you know, I want to thank you again, Alex, for letting us come on.
[02:01:02.883 --> 02:01:04.643]  And I appreciate you being on my show.
[02:01:05.304 --> 02:01:06.944]  But so much so much in the news, man.
[02:01:06.964 --> 02:01:08.284]  And I appreciate what you do every day.
[02:01:08.744 --> 02:01:09.564]  Don't thank me, brother.
[02:01:09.604 --> 02:01:11.065]  Let's talk about the future of the GOP.
[02:01:11.085 --> 02:01:12.665]  You've been all over that.
[02:01:13.105 --> 02:01:18.506]  They're pretty much capitulating now that Trump is the future of the GOP with with everybody.
[02:01:18.526 --> 02:01:20.806]  But McConnell is a Chinese agent.
[02:01:21.126 --> 02:01:22.647]  You've had Graham come out.
[02:01:22.727 --> 02:01:25.027]  You've had Pence come out and say, no, no, we're supporting Trump.
[02:01:25.899 --> 02:01:29.740]  Right, even after the book came out with former Vice President Mike Pence.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:35.382]  But you know, the interesting part about this is you have Mitt Romney, right, who is, you know, flip-flop Mitt Romney, as we call him.
[02:01:35.642 --> 02:01:41.985]  You know, one day he's anti-Trump, then the next day he's predicting that, yeah, Trump most likely will be the candidate in 2024.
[02:01:42.485 --> 02:01:43.785]  I appreciate him joining us.
[02:01:43.925 --> 02:01:47.286]  We'll get Kevin back on as soon as his systems work.
[02:01:47.346 --> 02:01:49.367]  It's always fun with Skype and things.
[02:01:49.467 --> 02:01:51.448]  Kevin, school chick, a lot of great points.
[02:01:51.468 --> 02:01:54.589]  Appreciate him coming on the broadcast here today.
[02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:56.628]  All right.
[02:01:57.649 --> 02:02:01.350]  Listen, I know a lot of the things we cover here sound completely insane.
[02:02:03.091 --> 02:02:06.632]  And then people later go, Oh my God, that's actually true.
[02:02:07.993 --> 02:02:10.534]  There's only four or five different types of people in the world.
[02:02:11.474 --> 02:02:13.215]  And they do the same stuff over and over again.
[02:02:13.255 --> 02:02:18.257]  Now with technology, they do it different ways, but it's still the same modus operandi.
[02:02:19.237 --> 02:02:19.337]  And
[02:02:20.529 --> 02:02:26.851]  Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates and all these people, they're not just obsessed with poisoning you or killing you.
[02:02:27.891 --> 02:02:32.353]  They're obsessed with changing you and making you them.
[02:02:33.873 --> 02:02:36.734]  And they'll take the weirdest things in worship, but the weirdest stuff.
[02:02:37.314 --> 02:02:42.016]  So they got the full clone genomes in the Pfizer vaccine of a kid that died in 1966.
[02:02:43.476 --> 02:02:44.977]  A little boy, they aborted at eight months.
[02:02:45.637 --> 02:02:48.238]  And they put his full genes into you.
[02:02:48.338 --> 02:02:49.478]  Some white kid from the US.
[02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:52.230]  You can pull his name up if you want.
[02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:55.332]  And then they got a particular jellyfish they put the whole genes of.
[02:02:55.372 --> 02:02:57.612]  And they ask, they ask, what's the jellyfish for?
[02:02:57.632 --> 02:02:59.093]  And they go, we're not going to tell you.
[02:02:59.413 --> 02:03:00.133]  It's experimental.
[02:03:00.173 --> 02:03:01.033]  We got authorization.
[02:03:03.174 --> 02:03:06.055]  But it's photoluminescence, glow-in-the-dark stuff.
[02:03:07.316 --> 02:03:08.576]  So that's what I'm telling you, folks.
[02:03:08.616 --> 02:03:09.816]  That's just one vaccine.
[02:03:09.836 --> 02:03:11.117]  That's one area of it.
[02:03:12.377 --> 02:03:13.838]  Top scientists look at this and they go,
[02:03:16.633 --> 02:03:17.913]  No one's ever done anything like this.
[02:03:17.933 --> 02:03:22.614]  This isn't just the protein to teach a cell how to make a protein, which causes its own list of problems.
[02:03:23.094 --> 02:03:24.034]  This is bizarre.
[02:03:24.114 --> 02:03:25.655]  Why is there a whole human genome there?
[02:03:25.995 --> 02:03:28.795]  Why is there a jellyfish colony creature genome?
[02:03:31.296 --> 02:03:35.116]  And it just goes on, and on, and on, and on.
[02:03:35.236 --> 02:03:42.417]  So, they come and give me this article out of the LA Times, fawningly, you'll get to drink Brad Pitt's blood.
[02:03:43.138 --> 02:03:45.118]  See how they're trying to externalize who they are?
[02:03:46.423 --> 02:03:46.883]  On to us.
[02:03:51.746 --> 02:03:53.467]  See, like we want to drink blood.
[02:03:55.068 --> 02:03:56.569]  But I mean, it's Brad Pitt.
[02:03:57.550 --> 02:04:14.520]  And so you get some of Brad Pitt's cells, and then you clone them in a laboratory, and then it's all stitched together by Microsoft, and you go eat that, and they'll get enough trendies in line screaming for it, especially a bunch of women wearing masks, oh, I'm gonna eat Brad Pitt blood.
[02:04:15.913 --> 02:04:16.973]  This is the end of the world, folks.
[02:04:17.414 --> 02:04:18.474]  I mean, you wonder what it's going to look like.
[02:04:18.494 --> 02:04:19.054]  This is going to be it.
[02:04:19.495 --> 02:04:23.697]  Mobs of screaming, trendy women wearing masks, eating Brad Pitt steaks.
[02:04:25.718 --> 02:04:28.359]  Printed up by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[02:04:28.939 --> 02:04:30.140]  They're telling you you're going to do it.
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:31.580]  And then they say it's for the earth.
[02:04:32.621 --> 02:04:35.482]  Well, you're going to have men lining up to buy women's steak dinners.
[02:04:35.962 --> 02:04:37.263]  And I love that they show real steak.
[02:04:38.984 --> 02:04:41.325]  And then they cut to this ugly, like that's real steak right there.
[02:04:41.545 --> 02:04:43.526]  Then they cut to this gross thing they're growing.
[02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:47.840]  Like, that's not... That's real meat right there.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:48.881]  It's hurting the earth.
[02:04:48.921 --> 02:04:50.683]  So now, you're gonna eat bugs.
[02:04:50.944 --> 02:04:53.947]  And they show some shot of cows in a feedlot.
[02:04:54.327 --> 02:04:55.669]  There's no cows in feedlots.
[02:04:55.689 --> 02:04:56.410]  1% are.
[02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:57.351]  They're about to be sold.
[02:04:58.766 --> 02:05:00.447]  So they fatten them up for a week before they're sold.
[02:05:00.707 --> 02:05:07.110]  You fly over Texas, or Kansas, or Montana, or Wyoming, or Arkansas, or hell, Illinois has got cows.
[02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:16.514]  And they're just cows on little farms, 20 acres, 100 acres, 200 acres, and they sell a few cows a year, and they have more cows, and you pay your property tax with the money you make off of it.
[02:05:18.215 --> 02:05:22.337]  But instead, oh, you're going to drink sewage, oh, you're going to eat bugs, oh, you're going to eat weeds.
[02:05:25.785 --> 02:05:27.606]  And it's just like, it's so cool.
[02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:32.007]  Leonardo DiCaprio, he goes and fawns over Klaus Schwab.
[02:05:32.367 --> 02:05:33.027]  Disgusting.
[02:05:34.808 --> 02:05:38.449]  You know, Leonardo DiCaprio is not going to be eating any blood steaks.
[02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:40.270]  Oh, you'll be paying a premium.
[02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:44.311]  He'll get a royalty, it says, off Leonardo DiCaprio's steak.
[02:05:44.511 --> 02:05:45.591]  You're like, well, I won't eat that.
[02:05:45.631 --> 02:05:47.492]  Well, your kid will in the school lunch program.
[02:05:49.633 --> 02:05:52.074]  Because they want to make you eat their cell line.
[02:05:52.754 --> 02:05:55.015]  And the studies show that actually it'll drift into your genetics.
[02:05:55.555 --> 02:05:56.295]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:05:56.335 --> 02:06:01.616]  It's every... Put some kid that they aborted at 66 in you and a jellyfish gene.
[02:06:01.656 --> 02:06:05.357]  It's all just attacking us and savaging us.
[02:06:05.417 --> 02:06:06.838]  And, oh, you're going to drink sewage.
[02:06:07.518 --> 02:06:10.261]  Oh, you're gonna say, oh, we're gonna, oh, I'm gonna live in a pod.
[02:06:10.501 --> 02:06:11.602]  Oh, we're gonna invade Hong Kong.
[02:06:12.023 --> 02:06:15.666]  Oh, we're gonna have death camps and all these f***ing fawning weirdos.
[02:06:16.087 --> 02:06:19.069]  They're all soulless, unhappy garbage.
[02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:22.793]  All there at Davos because the Rothschilds fund it.
[02:06:24.134 --> 02:06:27.798]  And we're all gonna eat Ellen DeGeneres salami.
[02:06:28.639 --> 02:06:31.822]  One company's quest to make meat from celebrity tissue samples.
[02:06:32.964 --> 02:06:33.284]  Yes!
[02:06:34.485 --> 02:06:35.846]  And of course it's Bill Gates funding it.
[02:06:36.266 --> 02:06:38.867]  And it's all a scam, it's all a failure, it's all a lie.
[02:06:39.167 --> 02:06:41.069]  So I salute the Indian farmers.
[02:06:41.909 --> 02:06:46.452]  The average size of a four acre farm can feed an average of ten people in India per five acres.
[02:06:46.472 --> 02:06:47.592]  They have the highest yield in the world.
[02:06:48.012 --> 02:06:48.913]  And they're not done.
[02:06:48.933 --> 02:06:54.416]  They're like, the government's coming in to standardize factory farming and they're revolting because they know what's going on.
[02:06:56.177 --> 02:06:57.558]  You know, under the Great Reset,
[02:06:58.817 --> 02:07:02.099]  They say that we're all going to be starving to death and they're going to kill hundreds of millions of third world.
[02:07:02.119 --> 02:07:11.526]  So I said, I got to size my neighbors up like the famous essay, A Modest Proposal.
[02:07:13.847 --> 02:07:15.488]  And the media said Jones wants to really eat his neighbors.
[02:07:15.528 --> 02:07:22.653]  No, I was, I was being sarcastic, but LA Times reports cloned meat of Brad Pitt, Ellen DeGeneres on store shelves.
[02:07:23.594 --> 02:07:26.776]  Like Bill Gates is like, how do I get him to stop eating regular meat?
[02:07:26.836 --> 02:07:28.397]  Well, say it's Brad Pitt's meat.
[02:07:29.841 --> 02:07:31.202]  Yes, we're not joking, folks.
[02:07:31.222 --> 02:07:31.502]  This is 2021.
[02:07:31.602 --> 02:07:33.883]  It's just going to get weirder from here on out.
[02:07:33.903 --> 02:07:42.428]  But joining us, before I get into more of that and then hand the baton over to Matt Bracken, who's got a lot to say, is Laura Loomer.
[02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:45.830]  She ran in a very competitive district where no Republican ever wins.
[02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:47.451]  Trump's district, he voted for her.
[02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:49.752]  She got record votes in it.
[02:07:49.852 --> 02:07:50.873]  She felt bad when she lost.
[02:07:50.933 --> 02:07:51.853]  I said, hell, you're in the arena.
[02:07:53.054 --> 02:07:57.917]  I encourage her to run again as soon as possible.
[02:07:59.707 --> 02:08:06.162]  And so here is Laura Loomer back in the arena to give us the latest at Loomer2022.com.
[02:08:06.924 --> 02:08:08.848]  Laura Loomer, great to have you back with us.
[02:08:10.526 --> 02:08:11.487]  Good to be here, Alex.
[02:08:11.667 --> 02:08:19.894]  And just as I did when I first filed to run in 2020, I wanted to make sure that I gave you and InfoWars the exclusive video interview.
[02:08:19.994 --> 02:08:21.555]  I filed to run last night.
[02:08:22.175 --> 02:08:24.717]  And look, we have to keep on fighting.
[02:08:24.898 --> 02:08:32.684]  And what's really interesting about here, you know, what's taking place here in Florida is now that the census has been done, we're going to have redistricting.
[02:08:33.224 --> 02:08:39.009]  And Florida is expected to pick up two to three more seats and District 21 might actually go red.
[02:08:39.509 --> 02:08:52.058]  In fact, Lois Frankel, the Democrat incumbent who I'm running against, just a few days ago, she sent out a fundraising email asking people to donate to her because she believes District 21, where I filed to run, may go red.
[02:08:52.078 --> 02:08:56.241]  And of course, this is where President Trump and the Trump family are now residents and voters.
[02:08:58.157 --> 02:08:59.939]  I'm glad you're giving us the exclusive here.
[02:08:59.959 --> 02:09:03.742]  We're very, very excited, and I know you've got a great shot.
[02:09:04.202 --> 02:09:10.567]  Florida is much brighter than Texas, because Florida knows it's fighting for its life against globalists and liberals and leftists.
[02:09:10.988 --> 02:09:15.511]  Texas is going blue, because the average Texans are like, no one ever asked us, boy!
[02:09:15.872 --> 02:09:17.993]  So I may have to move to Florida.
[02:09:18.314 --> 02:09:19.535]  Tell me what's happening in Florida.
[02:09:20.882 --> 02:09:30.869]  Well, I think you definitely have to move to Florida, and it looks like Florida is ground zero for cancel culture and the solutions, or at least solution-oriented people who want to address cancel culture.
[02:09:30.889 --> 02:09:33.891]  Well, it seems like everybody fighting back is in Florida.
[02:09:33.911 --> 02:09:37.834]  I mean, I'm sorry, I love Texas, but like, there's more fight in Florida than almost all the other states.
[02:09:39.008 --> 02:09:39.989]  Right, exactly.
[02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:42.991]  And you know, as I said before, President Trump is now a resident here.
[02:09:43.011 --> 02:09:44.952]  He lives in Palm Beach County at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:09:45.292 --> 02:09:48.494]  And we have a Republican controlled state legislature here.
[02:09:48.854 --> 02:09:55.338]  We have Republican senators and we have Governor DeSantis, the most popular governor in America, who of course is a Republican.
[02:09:55.758 --> 02:10:01.222]  And he was just in Palm Beach County last week to announce proposed legislation.
[02:10:01.702 --> 02:10:07.227]  By the way, that is certainly needed, but at least DeSantis is doing what Trump should have done.
[02:10:31.283 --> 02:10:32.083]  Right, exactly.
[02:10:32.143 --> 02:10:45.066]  And so the legislation is not perfect, but I'm hoping now, you know, look, we'll see if people want to put their money where their mouth is and we can use the Laura Limmer for Congress campaign as the test case for this proposed legislation.
[02:10:45.706 --> 02:10:52.707]  And I don't see any other governors across the country really doing much, but we had a great event last night at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.
[02:10:53.047 --> 02:10:56.968]  Congressman Paul Gosar flew down to endorse my candidacy.
[02:10:57.028 --> 02:10:58.068]  Roger Stone was there.
[02:10:58.628 --> 02:11:05.270]  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was supposed to be there, but due to Nancy Pelosi extending voting, she wasn't able to make it.
[02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:07.551]  I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, but let me talk to you later.
[02:11:07.591 --> 02:11:08.731]  I'm coming to Florida soon.
[02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:09.651]  Roger knows about it.
[02:11:09.671 --> 02:11:10.392]  Some other folks know.
[02:11:10.772 --> 02:11:14.053]  We definitely need to have an event, and I want to meet Dozer, and I want to meet Greene.
[02:11:14.353 --> 02:11:18.114]  Maybe we should fly her down there, because this is a very exciting moment in time.
[02:11:18.174 --> 02:11:19.894]  Laura Loomer, stay right there.
[02:11:19.954 --> 02:11:21.815]  Listen, Trump is stronger than ever.
[02:11:22.215 --> 02:11:25.176]  And the word is, we're going to have a Trump-DeSantis ticket.
[02:11:25.936 --> 02:11:26.917]  In three and a half years.
[02:11:27.457 --> 02:11:29.019]  We just hope Trump takes care of himself.
[02:11:29.159 --> 02:11:29.920]  God, I'm not perfect.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:37.566]  I love food too, but I heard Trump eats like three steaks, five lobster tails, prime rib, piles at the Trump International Concourse right there.
[02:11:37.927 --> 02:11:39.148]  All these crab legs, everything.
[02:11:39.468 --> 02:11:39.868]  I don't know.
[02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:41.129]  We need Trump to stay healthy.
[02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:42.811]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:44.332 --> 02:11:45.533]  Laura Loomer is a fighter!
[02:11:46.604 --> 02:11:49.028]  She's in the arena, and some stations just joined us.
[02:11:49.088 --> 02:11:53.073]  So, Laura, tell people what you're announcing, what you're doing.
[02:11:53.093 --> 02:11:58.641]  The woman in the arena, very exciting, what's happening with Governor DeSantis, what's happening with President Trump.
[02:11:59.022 --> 02:12:02.487]  We have only begun to fight against this globalist fraud, and they know it, and they're scared.
[02:12:03.715 --> 02:12:06.636]  Well, I just filed to run for Congress again, right?
[02:12:07.536 --> 02:12:10.537]  A relaunch of my campaign in Florida's 21st District.
[02:12:10.857 --> 02:12:13.238]  So, look, we have to keep on fighting.
[02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:17.539]  And I know that a lot of people are demoralized because of the stolen election and the voter fraud.
[02:12:17.579 --> 02:12:21.780]  But what they need to understand is that the voter fraud was enabled because of big tech.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:31.967]  And just like I said in 2020, when I was running for Congress, right, when I filed in 2019, big tech tyranny is the most important, you know, campaign issue of our lifetime.
[02:12:32.027 --> 02:12:34.749]  It's not just an issue here in the United States, it's a global issue.
[02:12:34.989 --> 02:12:39.252]  And when you look at the people who finance all of the voter fraud, well, it's the big tech executives, right?
[02:12:39.292 --> 02:12:41.913]  It's people who are tied to big technology.
[02:12:42.534 --> 02:12:47.377]  And so when we start holding big tech accountable for their actions, and when we start
[02:12:48.057 --> 02:13:15.525]  Using antitrust laws to break these companies up and when we encourage lawmakers to update the Civil Rights Act and the human rights clauses that exist in DC, where political affiliation is a protected class, when we extend that to all 50 states, it's only going to be then when conservatives are protected from this full-blown information war and assault that has been launched on them by the big tech tyrants and the Democrat Party.
[02:13:17.779 --> 02:13:30.173]  You warned people in Congress repeatedly that this was coming and you've been deplatformed and now you can't criticize NATO, now you can't criticize CNN, now we're like basically communist China.
[02:13:30.193 --> 02:13:35.058]  Now they're going after the bank accounts, the Airbnbs, the same thing they did to you and I, now it's everybody.
[02:13:35.398 --> 02:13:36.259]  Where is Congress?
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:39.383]  I mean, sure, Rand Paul, okay, Ted Cruz, a little bit.
[02:13:39.703 --> 02:13:41.304]  This, we need state legislatures.
[02:13:41.344 --> 02:13:42.385]  Thank God for DeSantis.
[02:13:42.906 --> 02:13:48.471]  Thank God, like, Poland just passed a law, $15 million fines if you ban political speech.
[02:13:49.012 --> 02:13:51.554]  They said, we just went through communism, you know, for decades.
[02:13:51.815 --> 02:13:53.216]  We know what danger is.
[02:13:53.736 --> 02:13:55.178]  Australia's fighting back a little bit.
[02:13:55.238 --> 02:14:00.223]  What's wrong with American government putting up with big tech pushing everybody around?
[02:14:01.169 --> 02:14:01.509]  We don't.
[02:14:01.989 --> 02:14:07.731]  The problem is, is that big tech now makes up one-fifth of our economy here in the United States, right?
[02:14:07.771 --> 02:14:13.092]  And so we have built an economy here in the United States of America that is dependent on these companies.
[02:14:13.512 --> 02:14:15.373]  And everyone in Congress is getting paid off.
[02:14:15.393 --> 02:14:23.975]  There's only a few members of Congress that I can think of, and I can count all of them on one hand, who actually have the balls to stand up to these companies and to not take money from them.
[02:14:24.355 --> 02:14:25.897]  I'm not going to take money from Big Tech.
[02:14:26.157 --> 02:14:36.146]  You know, my opponents, Google and the Big Tech companies, Comcast, they were giving her tons of donations to prevent me from getting elected to Congress.
[02:14:36.186 --> 02:14:38.268]  And look, DeSantis has made a first
[02:14:39.693 --> 02:14:40.233]  Good start.
[02:14:40.293 --> 02:14:48.476]  But the legislation is imperfect and it needs to be addressed because, as I said, it does nothing to help candidates like myself who were previously de-platformed.
[02:14:48.796 --> 02:14:54.698]  But I don't care how... If you understand legally, I'm not saying you're wrong, it's hard to get a law that's retroactive.
[02:14:55.718 --> 02:14:58.179]  People have to have the law and then violate it and then get in trouble.
[02:14:59.229 --> 02:15:07.514]  Right, but then that's not going to do anything because if candidates then file for exploratory committees or everybody's banned, then you're not going to be able to have social media.
[02:15:07.534 --> 02:15:08.055]  No, I agree.
[02:15:08.075 --> 02:15:09.696]  He should just go, oh, oh, oh.
[02:15:09.736 --> 02:15:11.297]  No, you're not saying retroactively on your case.
[02:15:11.717 --> 02:15:12.017]  I get it.
[02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:16.701]  You're saying once they file, then they get in trouble, they'll ban them in the embryonic phase.
[02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:17.161]  Oh, you're right.
[02:15:17.201 --> 02:15:17.401]  Yes.
[02:15:18.302 --> 02:15:20.703]  I'm talking about the application and the concept.
[02:15:20.723 --> 02:15:21.123]  No, you're right.
[02:15:21.143 --> 02:15:21.444]  You're right.
[02:15:21.684 --> 02:15:23.705]  Because they can censor before the person launches.
[02:15:23.725 --> 02:15:24.265]  That's important.
[02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.490]  We're good.
[02:15:45.587 --> 02:15:46.088]  Hi, I'm
[02:16:00.886 --> 02:16:07.470]  Here, in District 21, Palm Beach County, for what other candidates are... And that's why you're running with such a victory.
[02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:08.510]  You were like, should I run?
[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:09.531]  And I was like, absolutely.
[02:16:09.551 --> 02:16:19.536]  You said, well if I lose it'll be... I said, you're gonna expose their fraud, they're going to censor you, you've got to build the template to show the fraud so Congress and legislators can act, so thank God you did that.
[02:16:19.556 --> 02:16:25.659]  Everybody that donated didn't just spew money down a hole, they have built a key test case being looked at right now.
[02:16:25.959 --> 02:16:27.120]  I even know about Governor DeSantis.
[02:16:28.154 --> 02:16:28.935]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:29.155 --> 02:16:35.580]  And whether Governor DeSantis wants to admit it or not, the legislation was inspired by my congressional campaign.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:44.507]  The legislation was molded off of original legislation that was proposed by State Senator Joe Gruters, who is the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.
[02:16:44.987 --> 02:16:49.251]  And when he had the press conference in Tallahassee at the Florida State Capitol, he said,
[02:16:49.591 --> 02:16:54.853]  This legislation was inspired by Laura Loomer, a Florida business owner, a Florida candidate.
[02:16:55.054 --> 02:17:02.197]  It's not about bragging, it's about letting folks know that in the arena, even though you lost, you won by exposing this.
[02:17:02.217 --> 02:17:03.417]  So this is very exciting.
[02:17:03.978 --> 02:17:06.859]  What do you make of a Trump-DeSantis run in the next few years?
[02:17:08.203 --> 02:17:08.703]  Well, we'll see.
[02:17:08.783 --> 02:17:20.112]  I don't know if President Trump is going to run, but word here in Florida amongst the donor base and the political consultants is that they're trying to prep DeSantis for a 2024 presidential run.
[02:17:20.132 --> 02:17:23.635]  I don't know if Donald Trump really should run again.
[02:17:23.695 --> 02:17:26.217]  I think that maybe he should use his power and his influence.
[02:17:26.717 --> 02:17:27.098]  I agree.
[02:17:45.559 --> 02:17:46.440]  I totally agree.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:52.622]  I mean, look at Mitch McConnell's wife on the Chinese payroll and now he's going to support Merrick Garland who wants to confiscate guns.
[02:18:01.363 --> 02:18:01.623]  Right.
[02:18:02.124 --> 02:18:06.306]  And so they talk about America First as a fundraising grift, but they're not actually America First.
[02:18:06.366 --> 02:18:11.049]  In fact, they try to ostracize a lot of the America First candidates as being too radical or too extreme.
[02:18:11.529 --> 02:18:14.952]  I mean, look at Greene, 75% winning in Georgia.
[02:18:14.972 --> 02:18:20.135]  They're scared, particularly of smart women, taking over the party.
[02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:35.044]  Right, and then they try to compensate by propping up these bimbo candidates, right, who they can't even hold a candle to people like me and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, right?
[02:18:35.324 --> 02:18:39.508]  They prop up- Are you talking about all these Islamic tarts?
[02:18:39.528 --> 02:18:47.435]  Right, no, I'm talking about these so-called Republican individuals who- Oh, you're talking about the Republican-like kind of, yeah, those.
[02:18:48.297 --> 02:18:58.612]  Like these rhino candidates who pretend to be America first and they find some cute girl and put her in a short dress and prop her up on Fox News and say, ooh, this is going to be the antidote to AOC.
[02:18:58.652 --> 02:19:00.715]  But the good news is people are sussing that out.
[02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:02.834]  Right, and they are.
[02:19:02.874 --> 02:19:17.833]  They're starting to realize that this has been the grift and that the candidates, generally speaking, when the NRCC or the Republican Party props up a candidate, right, they're really not going to fight for you because people like myself and Marjorie Taylor Greene, we don't get supported by the NRCC.
[02:19:17.873 --> 02:19:19.155]  They didn't give me a dime, right?
[02:19:19.535 --> 02:19:22.217]  Because I am fighting for the American people.
[02:19:22.457 --> 02:19:24.939]  I truly am a MAGA America First candidate.
[02:19:25.039 --> 02:19:25.399]  I agree.
[02:19:25.419 --> 02:19:32.284]  What do you make of them trying to ban all these conservatives from CPAC, even though CPAC's being banned on Twitter for having Trump?
[02:19:32.304 --> 02:19:33.044]  Are you going to CPAC?
[02:19:34.325 --> 02:19:35.286]  I'm going to be in Orlando.
[02:19:35.306 --> 02:19:37.628]  I'm going to AFPAC, which is
[02:19:38.598 --> 02:19:39.219]  Yeah, look, it's tomorrow.
[02:19:39.299 --> 02:19:42.961]  As soon as I'm done with this interview, I'm getting in the car and I'm driving to Orlando.
[02:20:06.015 --> 02:20:11.580]  Well, I would love to have you, once you're there, if you've got time to do a stand-up or inside or send us clips, I would love to have you on.
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:18.126]  But you've announced for Congress here, the website is Loomer2022.com.
[02:20:18.867 --> 02:20:21.149]  Just Loomer2022.com.
[02:20:21.529 --> 02:20:22.850]  Thank you so much, Laura Loomer.
[02:20:22.890 --> 02:20:24.892]  Talk to us tomorrow or talk to us next week.
[02:20:24.932 --> 02:20:25.633]  Congratulations.
[02:20:26.465 --> 02:20:33.127]  Thank you, and I encourage people to go to my website and make a donation today because we are fighting cancel culture here in Palm Beach County.
[02:20:33.187 --> 02:20:33.547]  Thank you.
[02:20:33.807 --> 02:20:34.087]  You are.
[02:20:34.107 --> 02:20:35.708]  You're fighting hard right in the belly of the beast, folks.
[02:20:35.788 --> 02:20:37.868]  Loomer2022.com.
[02:20:37.908 --> 02:20:38.508]  She's a great lady.
[02:20:38.848 --> 02:20:39.689]  Laura Loomer, we salute you.
[02:20:39.709 --> 02:20:43.550]  Our final segment, then the next guest comes up, and that is going to be Matt Bracken.
[02:20:43.950 --> 02:20:44.370]  Guest host.
[02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:47.931]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, listen.
[02:20:50.953 --> 02:20:52.254]  I don't calculate what I say on air.
[02:20:52.274 --> 02:20:53.014]  I just tell the truth.
[02:20:53.054 --> 02:20:54.175]  I give you my best analysis.
[02:20:55.076 --> 02:20:57.998]  And I just keep feeling guilty that I'm not raising enough of an alarm.
[02:20:58.058 --> 02:20:59.679]  I mean, the country is being taken over.
[02:21:00.139 --> 02:21:01.961]  The nuke codes are trying to get the nuke codes.
[02:21:02.001 --> 02:21:03.442]  They're dissolving the borders.
[02:21:03.882 --> 02:21:05.063]  They're attacking our children.
[02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:07.484]  They're just announcing every form of evil you can imagine.
[02:21:07.885 --> 02:21:12.088]  But the good news is they are desperate and they want you to lose track of God.
[02:21:13.029 --> 02:21:14.870]  And I realize they want me to be that way as well.
[02:21:15.251 --> 02:21:16.852]  This is a real image, folks.
[02:21:16.872 --> 02:21:17.592]  This is in the news.
[02:21:18.333 --> 02:21:23.076]  Southern California woman's new idea photo has her wearing a mask.
[02:21:23.096 --> 02:21:27.399]  Again, I'm dirty, I'm bad, I'm wearing a face diaper.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.000]  I'm not showing you my face.
[02:21:30.361 --> 02:21:31.142]  This is what's going on.
[02:21:31.162 --> 02:21:32.063]  This is a cult.
[02:21:33.083 --> 02:21:39.408]  And we're a year into the mask, a year into the lockdowns, and it's more intense than ever.
[02:21:39.468 --> 02:21:40.809]  I walked into a business this morning,
[02:21:42.602 --> 02:21:46.004]  They asked me not to say where and a young woman walks up and I said, you don't need to wear a mask with me.
[02:21:46.044 --> 02:21:47.565]  And she says, Oh, I really liked you.
[02:21:48.065 --> 02:21:49.686]  I don't, my mom's a big listener.
[02:21:49.726 --> 02:21:51.207]  Her mom was there just visiting.
[02:21:51.247 --> 02:21:56.590]  She comes out of the, I guess the accounting room or whatever behind the counter and like, Oh, I love you, Alex Jones, all this other stuff.
[02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:58.651]  But the young woman goes, but they watch this on camera.
[02:21:58.971 --> 02:22:00.172]  I can't even say I like you.
[02:22:00.512 --> 02:22:05.675]  And then basically did my checking out and then wouldn't talk to me anymore.
[02:22:06.676 --> 02:22:09.797]  I mean, since when in America can you not say this is BS?
[02:22:09.977 --> 02:22:10.778]  It's, it's a cult.
[02:22:12.665 --> 02:22:16.588]  And complying and going along with the system only makes it worse.
[02:22:16.668 --> 02:22:23.954]  So imagine Bill Gates for years saying, soon you will not get meat but once a year on your birthday.
[02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:26.216]  And now he's all over TV.
[02:22:26.236 --> 02:22:28.038]  We save the earth, you don't get meat.
[02:22:28.058 --> 02:22:29.219]  You're like, well, how's he gonna do that?
[02:22:29.599 --> 02:22:33.042]  They're gonna put taxes on cattle raising so high you can't pay for it.
[02:22:33.783 --> 02:22:39.507]  And they've got all the comedy shows attacking meat packing and saying it's dirty and evil because it increases IQ.
[02:22:41.718 --> 02:22:43.918]  Because it's how our craniums grew larger.
[02:22:43.978 --> 02:22:45.359]  It's just meat makes us healthier.
[02:22:46.099 --> 02:22:48.999]  Overall hurts our heart, but it's very good for your brain.
[02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:51.680]  It's got its own problems.
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:52.940]  Nobody's endorsing all of it.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:23:01.842]  But they want control of that industry just like they want control of all of their agriculture and all of their science and all of their energy.
[02:23:03.022 --> 02:23:09.403]  And so if you think the master criminal Bill Gates telling you, you can't have regular meat,
[02:23:11.004 --> 02:23:12.064]  You've got to have his meat.
[02:23:12.084 --> 02:23:13.405]  You wonder, well, how are they going to roll that out?
[02:23:13.465 --> 02:23:18.826]  Well, oh my gosh, my favorite celebrity, whether it's Brad Pitt or Ellen DeGeneres, that's the headline, L.A.
[02:23:18.866 --> 02:23:22.327]  Times, they take their cells and then clone it.
[02:23:22.487 --> 02:23:23.567]  That's what Gates says.
[02:23:23.807 --> 02:23:25.288]  We take beef cells and clone it.
[02:23:25.348 --> 02:23:29.349]  And then it's extruded by a machine that's grown from insect protein.
[02:23:29.769 --> 02:23:31.149]  So what are they feeding the insects?
[02:23:32.709 --> 02:23:39.231]  And it's just about training you to accept nothing and have nothing and then only buy it from them who roll out the new industry.
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:45.884]  Ellen Degenerate, salami, one company's quest to make meat from celebrity tissue samples.
[02:23:46.324 --> 02:23:52.489]  And only trendies would want this, but it's about, oh, you pay on a patent eating my flesh, which is cannibalism.
[02:23:52.709 --> 02:23:57.893]  So the headline should be, biotech companies promote
[02:23:59.062 --> 02:24:00.604]  Cloned cannibal meat.
[02:24:01.325 --> 02:24:06.672]  Biotech companies promote cannibalism from cloned human celebrity flesh.
[02:24:06.993 --> 02:24:07.974]  There's the actual headline.
[02:24:08.775 --> 02:24:14.242]  So we'll take this segment and that earlier segment I did at the end of the last hour and put it together because that's what it is.
[02:24:14.563 --> 02:24:15.945]  And again, Hitler
[02:24:17.142 --> 02:24:17.542]  We're good to go.
[02:24:34.104 --> 02:24:40.952]  They've got clone genetics of Jeffrey Epstein, not just little children's DNA, not just their genomes, but it's Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:24:41.312 --> 02:24:41.833]  That's the word.
[02:24:42.133 --> 02:24:50.423]  Jeffrey Epstein's genome is in these vaccines because they believed he was this god, this Nephilim, and then you will take this into your body.
[02:24:50.543 --> 02:24:51.604]  He will rape you.
[02:24:52.245 --> 02:24:55.908]  And Bill Gates will rape you with the mRNA, which they admit the Pfizer one has.
[02:24:56.248 --> 02:24:59.230]  Dead kids whole genomes, jellyfish whole genomes.
[02:24:59.710 --> 02:25:09.056]  And then they had Bill Gates involved with Epstein, and they were all involved compromising top scientists and doing all this stuff.
[02:25:10.577 --> 02:25:17.302]  And what they're obsessed with is secret breeding programs, but also having their genetics put into your genes.
[02:25:20.191 --> 02:25:23.315]  So, who wants to be in the salami?
[02:25:23.375 --> 02:25:24.456]  James Franco?
[02:25:24.496 --> 02:25:25.477]  Jennifer Lawrence?
[02:25:27.239 --> 02:25:30.743]  All they do is get a blood sample and now it's grown into meat.
[02:25:30.823 --> 02:25:31.804]  Kanye West!
[02:25:33.506 --> 02:25:35.007]  And then you eat their flesh.
[02:25:36.209 --> 02:25:38.311]  It's all about cannibalism and what does that do?
[02:25:40.163 --> 02:25:40.263]  It's
[02:25:58.646 --> 02:26:01.870]  These people, they were just showing it, where they have people laying in vats of blood.
[02:26:01.930 --> 02:26:03.712]  It's real blood, but it's a model in the blood.
[02:26:03.992 --> 02:26:11.622]  Then all the trainees come over and take little dipsticks, like you do for little ice cream at Baskin Robbins, and you dip it in the blood and go, oh, liberal, oh!
[02:26:12.342 --> 02:26:14.105]  But that's the externalization of the method.
[02:26:15.236 --> 02:26:16.296]  That's the lesser magic.
[02:26:16.757 --> 02:26:30.922]  First they do it in a vat of pig blood that a woman's in, or cow blood, and everybody thinks they're all powerful doing something nasty and evil, and now the celebrities are like, oh yeah, I'll let you take some of my blood, and clone it, and sell it in synthetic meat, it saves the earth!
[02:26:31.163 --> 02:26:32.483]  And you get to eat red pit!
[02:26:32.583 --> 02:26:34.484]  How gross is that?
[02:26:38.939 --> 02:26:41.102]  And look at the men, look at the women.
[02:26:41.342 --> 02:26:45.367]  They're all just vassal, chicken neck, shrunken slaves.
[02:26:45.707 --> 02:26:48.170]  Like the little mermaid down in Maleficent's grotto.
[02:26:50.253 --> 02:26:52.956]  I mean, who wants to be around that?
[02:26:52.976 --> 02:26:53.357]  Let me tell you.
[02:26:54.767 --> 02:26:55.508]  I hate Hollywood.
[02:26:55.588 --> 02:26:56.249]  I can't stand it.
[02:26:56.489 --> 02:26:57.550]  I can't watch any of it now.
[02:26:57.611 --> 02:26:57.911]  None of it.
[02:26:58.552 --> 02:27:07.162]  And Hollywood tried to seduce me, and I just literally felt sick when I was there, and I felt depressed when I was there, and I was just like, I couldn't get out.
[02:27:07.262 --> 02:27:11.407]  As soon as my plane, flying in commercial, would be coming in to L.A.
[02:27:12.128 --> 02:27:16.974]  I would feel like, oh, like, you know, when Obi-Wan Kenobi, Alderaan blows up, he's like, oh, I feel great disturbance of the force, right?
[02:27:16.994 --> 02:27:19.657]  It's just millions of lives cried out or suddenly silenced.
[02:27:20.157 --> 02:27:21.379]  That's who they are.
[02:27:21.439 --> 02:27:22.340]  They're gone.
[02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:23.962]  They're the losers.
[02:27:23.982 --> 02:27:26.124]  That's why they have red carpets and
[02:27:27.265 --> 02:27:37.049]  Sapphires and rhinestones and diamonds and glitz and lights and all the pretty people that come like flies to the web to get caught in it.
[02:27:37.329 --> 02:27:39.650]  The place you want to be is not Hollywood.
[02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:41.990]  Brad Pitt is a loser.
[02:27:43.591 --> 02:27:45.132]  All of them are losers.
[02:27:45.212 --> 02:27:46.052]  They're jokes.
[02:27:46.452 --> 02:27:47.332]  They're over.
[02:27:47.632 --> 02:27:48.753]  They're nobodies.
[02:27:48.913 --> 02:27:49.553]  They know it.
[02:27:49.793 --> 02:27:51.554]  They're owned by the producers.
[02:27:53.772 --> 02:28:04.419]  And all these weird inbred billionaire occultists and the people they worship, the people they hold up as victors, are jokes.
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:07.821]  All right, he's going to take over, Matt Bracken.
[02:28:08.382 --> 02:28:09.343]  EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[02:28:09.383 --> 02:28:11.164]  He's got a lot to say about where this country is.

[02:28:23.656 --> 02:28:26.761]  We don't normally do this early in the year, but there's emergencies going on.
[02:28:26.821 --> 02:28:27.542]  Times are crazy.

[02:28:48.898 --> 02:28:51.739]  And there's no celebrity DNA in any of this, okay?
[02:28:51.779 --> 02:28:53.641]  No cloned Brad Pitt stuff.
[02:28:53.821 --> 02:28:54.801]  We would not do that.
[02:28:54.821 --> 02:29:00.125]  We'd kill ourselves for we'd buy that loser, that little dirtbag maggot nobody piece of crap.
[02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:20.736]  You know, seeing those three book covers, my first three books, the Enemies, Foreign, and Domestic trilogy, which means three books, people ask me, Matt, when are you writing the next book?
[02:29:21.717 --> 02:29:23.698]  And I got one answer now.
[02:29:23.978 --> 02:29:24.598]  We're living it.
[02:29:24.738 --> 02:29:27.880]  I don't need to write it because we're in the middle of it.
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:29.621]  And if you haven't figured that out yet,
[02:29:30.310 --> 02:29:32.931]  Well, maybe go back and read the books again.
[02:29:32.951 --> 02:29:38.793]  But yeah, we're we are now living in the enemy's foreign and domestic reality.
[02:29:38.813 --> 02:29:43.494]  I was watching Laura Loomer's interview with Alex very closely.
[02:29:43.514 --> 02:29:54.618]  And she's a real pioneer and trailblazer in this in this, this digital democracy, because she got nuked from orbit by big tech.
[02:29:55.549 --> 02:30:04.292]  You know, the GOP, the Florida GOP, a bunch of, a lot of rhinos, even though DeSantis is a great governor, the state establishment sure didn't help her.
[02:30:04.972 --> 02:30:08.813]  But she got cut off at the knees digitally.
[02:30:09.613 --> 02:30:16.835]  I was just watching yesterday, I was watching a recent Stefan Molyneux video on Bitshoot.
[02:30:17.616 --> 02:30:19.136]  He got nuked off of YouTube.
[02:30:19.156 --> 02:30:25.218]  He had, I don't know, half a million, a million followers, and he got digitally disappeared.
[02:30:26.013 --> 02:30:36.559]  And the video I just saw of him on BitChute, he says that being digitally disappeared is just practice for being really disappeared from the world.
[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:45.404]  And I would have to say at this point, I've come to the conclusion that big tech is by far more powerful than government.
[02:30:46.485 --> 02:30:53.469]  We recently saw Australia come to blows with Facebook and Australia had to surrender.
[02:30:54.164 --> 02:30:59.747]  Facebook forced a nation, a continent, to back down on Facebook's terms.
[02:31:01.088 --> 02:31:05.331]  We're at the point where the Democrats love censorship.
[02:31:06.031 --> 02:31:19.459]  They support Google, Alphabet, YouTube 100%, and half of the Republicans do too, because these big tech titans, the corporate titans, they pay everybody.
[02:31:20.262 --> 02:31:22.303]  You know, there are very few congressmen.
[02:31:23.043 --> 02:31:28.066]  Matt Gaetz from the Panhandle of Florida is one of the few that doesn't take that money.
[02:31:28.886 --> 02:31:33.068]  But the big tech corporate titans, they're paying off everybody.
[02:31:33.569 --> 02:31:40.472]  So it's almost like we have a joke of a Congress at this point, a joke of a government, because they're not representing us.
[02:31:41.012 --> 02:31:44.234]  They're just completely sold out to corporate interests.
[02:31:44.294 --> 02:31:44.734]  That's it.
[02:31:45.114 --> 02:31:45.674]  Period.
[02:31:46.375 --> 02:31:46.495]  End.
[02:31:47.242 --> 02:31:51.843]  And anybody that thinks we're going to vote our way out of this, well, I hope that we can.
[02:31:51.863 --> 02:31:55.744]  I watched Bannon's War Room in the morning.
[02:31:55.764 --> 02:32:08.347]  They frequently have a guest on, I don't remember his name offhand, but he has, if there is a chance for saving this democracy, this is something that Laura Loomer reminded me of.
[02:32:09.568 --> 02:32:14.129]  There's a website called Precinct Project.
[02:32:15.017 --> 02:32:17.618]  I think it's wordpress.com, something like that.
[02:32:17.678 --> 02:32:30.005]  But the precinct project is, this guy that comes on Bannon's War Room pretty frequently, he says, you won't know this, but at the county and precinct level, there are a lot of unfilled positions.
[02:32:30.045 --> 02:32:34.367]  Like half of the precinct captain and precinct commissioner positions, they're just unfilled.
[02:32:34.928 --> 02:32:39.390]  They're run from higher above by these GOPE rhinos.
[02:32:40.342 --> 02:32:49.609]  But if you actually show up at the meetings, if you find out where your county meetings are going to be held, and you actually show up and volunteer, it doesn't take many people.
[02:32:49.689 --> 02:32:52.130]  We're talking about like one night a month.
[02:32:52.831 --> 02:32:58.455]  It doesn't take many MAGA nation, you know, conservative, traditional Americans showing up.
[02:32:58.959 --> 02:33:11.870]  To overturn the larger state and county level GOPE rhinos that just want to be invited to the cool parties and they don't give a damn about MAGA Nation.
[02:33:12.511 --> 02:33:23.921]  They only ran as Republicans because they were in a state or a county where that was their best chance of getting into electoral office and they really don't, politically, they don't give a damn.
[02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:30.844]  They just want to be the Washington generals who will pay the losers that the Harlem Globetrotters always beat.
[02:33:31.404 --> 02:33:32.325]  That's their gig.
[02:33:32.825 --> 02:33:39.568]  But we can take over, according to some people that think by 2022, we'll know if it's a fact or not.
[02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:52.835]  If there's any chance of saving this country, you know, short of a complete collapse and possibly, you know, some kind of a civil war, it has to be by taking it over from the precinct level up.
[02:33:54.233 --> 02:33:56.937]  I mean, I have my doubts if that's even possible at this point.
[02:33:57.378 --> 02:34:02.967]  I think in a way it's almost as if Skynet has taken over and they've just got Borgs.
[02:34:03.615 --> 02:34:07.678]  Who are the mouthpieces, you know, that just are the faces that we see.
[02:34:08.199 --> 02:34:10.361]  But it's just really an AI program.
[02:34:10.801 --> 02:34:15.405]  I mean, can anybody convince you that Mark Zuckerberg is an actual human being?
[02:34:16.005 --> 02:34:16.966]  Or Jack Dorsey?
[02:34:17.547 --> 02:34:22.171]  How would we know if they were not just, you know, created by an AI program?
[02:34:22.511 --> 02:34:28.736]  They certainly give all the outward appearances of being aliens that are trying to pretend to be human.
[02:34:28.756 --> 02:34:28.796]  So,
[02:34:30.353 --> 02:34:35.555]  If you do poke your nose into local politics, maybe there's a chance that way.
[02:34:36.395 --> 02:34:41.336]  Otherwise, all of the signs are in place of a complete societal collapse.
[02:34:41.476 --> 02:34:43.217]  I mean a total societal collapse.
[02:34:44.077 --> 02:34:46.478]  Right now they're going after our children.
[02:34:46.718 --> 02:34:59.402]  We are seeing even today, God bless Rand Paul, for having the nerve to go after quote-unquote Rachel Levine, that freak with the fake falsetto voice and the curly wig.
[02:35:00.236 --> 02:35:06.218]  You know, having the guts to ask her about, you know, mutilating children.
[02:35:06.698 --> 02:35:09.199]  You can't give a child a Tylenol without permission.
[02:35:09.699 --> 02:35:24.504]  But the child that is going to just get sucked into a vortex where they're going to go to a counselor who's going to, you know, fill out the form to get you on the program for hormone blockers so that you won't go through puberty.
[02:35:25.124 --> 02:35:28.605]  If you're a female, you'll grow a beard that you'll never be able to get rid of.
[02:35:29.568 --> 02:35:35.312]  If you're a girl, they'll encourage you to have your breasts amputated as a child.
[02:35:36.252 --> 02:35:39.194]  And there are a lot of crazy parents that will go along with this.
[02:35:39.254 --> 02:35:41.475]  Just look at the drag queen story hours.
[02:35:42.336 --> 02:35:46.759]  Those poor children are brought there by crazy SJW parents.
[02:35:47.459 --> 02:35:58.506]  So, in terms of these children getting, you know, manipulated into transitioning as teens, it's often their crazy parents bringing them there.
[02:35:59.164 --> 02:35:59.745]  We're good to go.
[02:36:14.366 --> 02:36:23.053]  You know, when a valve cracks and, you know, the rod gets thrown through the head of the engine, it doesn't suddenly get better.
[02:36:23.093 --> 02:36:24.454]  It doesn't, like, self-heal.
[02:36:25.034 --> 02:36:27.196]  You know, the oscillations grow worse.
[02:36:27.296 --> 02:36:28.857]  The vibrations get worse.
[02:36:29.518 --> 02:36:43.549]  This is a sign for smart people to be thinking about, you know, parachutes and bailout strategies, because I can't think in history of an occasion where, you know, a runaway train heading toward a missing bridge
[02:36:44.432 --> 02:37:02.089]  Self repairs when you've got a, you know, the locomotive has been hijacked by insane clowns who think that, you know, by wishing good thoughts, they're going to make the locomotive defy gravity and physics and just fly across the canyon.
[02:37:02.711 --> 02:37:05.233]  You know, based on some theory.
[02:37:05.253 --> 02:37:07.835]  And it's never in history happened.
[02:37:08.235 --> 02:37:21.046]  When a country goes this crazy, when the leadership is taken over by such an insane clown posse as this, it always winds up with killing fields, or gulags, or gas chambers.
[02:37:21.566 --> 02:37:23.848]  I can't think of an occasion where it didn't happen.
[02:37:24.915 --> 02:37:33.538]  And there's something new in this situation today because they wouldn't necessarily need to build a physical gulag.
[02:37:34.038 --> 02:37:39.000]  They might not need to drag us onto trains and take us to concentration camps.
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:45.262]  We've seen how they're doing this in baby steps with unpersoning people.
[02:37:45.602 --> 02:37:47.283]  Just take away your Patreon.
[02:37:47.802 --> 02:37:51.424]  Take away your credit card, your banking ability.
[02:37:51.864 --> 02:37:55.786]  They've done this with a lot of pretty well-known people.
[02:37:55.886 --> 02:38:01.148]  I mean, Stefan Molyneux, I hadn't even thought about him in many months because they disappeared the dude.
[02:38:01.869 --> 02:38:08.472]  And what he says is, disappearing you digitally is practice for actual extermination.
[02:38:09.272 --> 02:38:14.774]  And even without a gulag, imagine if they just, step by step, let's say you don't register your guns.
[02:38:14.814 --> 02:38:20.836]  They pass this gun control law, which I'll talk about in the next segment, and you refuse to comply.
[02:38:20.976 --> 02:38:21.336]  Okay.
[02:38:22.317 --> 02:38:24.617]  Next thing you know, your credit card doesn't work.
[02:38:25.258 --> 02:38:26.898]  Then your electricity goes off.
[02:38:26.958 --> 02:38:28.119]  Then your water goes off.
[02:38:28.219 --> 02:38:29.119]  No boxcar.
[02:38:29.979 --> 02:38:31.620]  We'll talk about this when we come back.
[02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:38.042]  When we went out, I was talking about a new threat, which is
[02:38:39.675 --> 02:38:44.999]  We've been through history in our education, our training, everything we've learned.
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:51.604]  We think when they come for us, they're going to kick in our door, do a Roger Stone on us.
[02:38:52.685 --> 02:38:59.189]  And maybe when it serves their purposes, when they've got the CNN camera crew lined up, they'll actually do that.
[02:38:59.870 --> 02:39:08.556]  If it's some notable person that they actually want to make a point of showing the world the power of the FBI stormtroopers
[02:39:09.375 --> 02:39:14.457]  To, you know, drag a man in his 70s out of his bed in the middle of the night.
[02:39:14.477 --> 02:39:18.339]  His, you know, his wife as well.
[02:39:18.359 --> 02:39:21.260]  And they want to make a point, look, we don't care.
[02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:21.840]  We're brutes.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.321]  We're brutal and we work with the media.
[02:39:24.361 --> 02:39:26.863]  So we really don't give a damn about you.
[02:39:27.803 --> 02:39:30.044]  And we'll do this to Roger Stone.
[02:39:30.344 --> 02:39:31.605]  We'll do this to anybody.
[02:39:32.885 --> 02:39:37.147]  And I'm sure that, you know, that Roger and Alex go to bed every night.
[02:39:37.935 --> 02:39:42.396]  Wondering about this, because they're certainly on the hit list.
[02:39:42.616 --> 02:39:44.957]  They're on the hit list by name.
[02:39:44.977 --> 02:39:48.658]  And this is one of the reasons that I'm proud to come on the show.
[02:39:49.298 --> 02:40:03.421]  Because if we're all the gray man, you know, if everybody's just trying to keep your head down low and not be noticed, then they're just gonna hammer down the tall nails one at a time till there's no nails sticking up.
[02:40:04.329 --> 02:40:32.735]  So the more that we do show that we're not afraid, that we're willing to show our face, show our name, I think that it makes it a bigger problem for our tech tyrants, this emerging dictatorship, which is an amalgam of the Democrat Party, half of the Republicans who won't admit it, but they really are just, they might as well be Democrats, and big tech and the giant corporate interests.
[02:40:33.877 --> 02:40:38.639]  I mean, we've seen it with this Operation Red Mirage.
[02:40:39.419 --> 02:40:44.401]  They came out and admitted it in the article in Time Magazine a couple weeks ago.
[02:40:44.981 --> 02:40:47.502]  They just called it fortifying the election.
[02:40:47.522 --> 02:40:53.925]  That sounds like something that they would say in Venezuela, you know, with Chavez or Maduro.
[02:40:53.945 --> 02:40:55.925]  Yeah, we didn't steal the election.
[02:40:56.045 --> 02:40:56.565]  Wink, wink.
[02:40:56.626 --> 02:40:58.106]  We just fortified it.
[02:40:58.546 --> 02:41:01.207]  In other words, we made sure we can't lose.
[02:41:02.128 --> 02:41:03.108]  They're admitting it now.
[02:41:04.133 --> 02:41:10.555]  So, why do I even think, let's do this precinct project strategy and try to take over the GOP?
[02:41:11.316 --> 02:41:26.821]  I say that because what will happen when this country absolutely goes off the rails is going to be so terrible that we won't want to think that we didn't do everything possible to avert the tragedy.
[02:41:26.841 --> 02:41:31.563]  I often compare what could happen in this country
[02:41:32.378 --> 02:41:36.940]  To Weimar Germany, we know where that led, hyperinflation and then Hitler.
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:49.646]  Yugoslavia, the breakup of Yugoslavia, decade of civil war, bloody religious and ethnic civil war, and Rwanda.
[02:41:50.086 --> 02:41:59.751]  And I say Rwanda because this identity politics, critical race theory, what it's doing is priming our country for a race war.
[02:42:00.703 --> 02:42:04.666]  The people at the bottom of the pyramid, they may be too dumb to realize it.
[02:42:05.186 --> 02:42:07.268]  They may actually be useful idiots.
[02:42:08.208 --> 02:42:12.891]  But the folks at the top of this power pyramid, they understand where this is going.
[02:42:13.312 --> 02:42:16.094]  They're pushing this country towards a bloody race war.
[02:42:16.714 --> 02:42:22.958]  So imagine Rwanda times Yugoslavia times Weimar Germany.
[02:42:23.799 --> 02:42:28.042]  That's the tribulation we will be going through
[02:42:28.817 --> 02:42:31.698]  If we can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:42:31.718 --> 02:42:38.039]  So it's a real question if we can ever put this country back together and take it away from where it's going.
[02:42:38.479 --> 02:42:47.641]  You know, stolen elections, a complete Pravda false narrative cooked up between the Democrats and big tech social media.
[02:42:47.661 --> 02:42:56.663]  You know, but if there's any chance of putting it together, which is I think best distilled in this precinct project strategy,
[02:42:57.406 --> 02:43:11.012]  If there's any chance to put it together, we have to at least do all we can, because just saying, bring on a civil war, is like saying, bring on a hand grenade and I'll hold it in my hand and pull the pin.
[02:43:11.552 --> 02:43:13.073]  It's going to be a disaster.
[02:43:13.173 --> 02:43:16.274]  It will be the worst thing that ever happened in this country.
[02:43:16.854 --> 02:43:20.516]  Worse than the Great Depression, worse than the first civil war.
[02:43:21.405 --> 02:43:23.867]  Worse than any war we've been in, by far.
[02:43:23.967 --> 02:43:26.149]  It'll tear this country to pieces.
[02:43:26.749 --> 02:43:38.359]  And none of us who survive it, which, you know, will be a very risky proposition to assume anybody will survive it, none that survive it will be able to know what we'll have on the other end.
[02:43:38.939 --> 02:43:47.987]  But a constitutional republic with a high standard of living and freedom, that's very unlikely to come out of it.
[02:43:48.747 --> 02:43:49.168]  So yes,
[02:43:49.947 --> 02:43:56.134]  Even though the chance of writing this ship is very small, we have to at least push for it.
[02:43:57.035 --> 02:44:03.582]  But what's got me really worried is this martial law posture at the Capitol.
[02:44:03.602 --> 02:44:10.409]  The fences, you know, the miles of fences with razor wire on top, the armed soldiers around our Capitol.
[02:44:11.903 --> 02:44:16.005]  It's telling me that they're not done with their pushing their main narrative.
[02:44:16.665 --> 02:44:37.135]  And the main narrative that they've been pushing, even when Trump was in office, is that white supremacist domestic terrorists, and they're trying to roll that into one thought pattern, white terrorist, white supremacist domestic terrorist, white equals terrorist.
[02:44:37.631 --> 02:44:42.412]  This is the main drum that they have been beating for the last several years.
[02:44:42.933 --> 02:44:46.354]  The Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, even under Trump.
[02:44:47.154 --> 02:44:52.876]  Because even though Trump was the president, in many ways, he was the president in name only.
[02:44:53.416 --> 02:44:59.318]  When he tried to declassify documents from the FBI, they gave him the double-barreled middle finger.
[02:45:00.138 --> 02:45:03.539]  They just said, screw you, what are you going to do about it?
[02:45:03.619 --> 02:45:05.740]  Come down to the J. Edgar Hoover building and look?
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:06.660]  Good luck.
[02:45:07.446 --> 02:45:16.353]  So even though he was the president, he never was able to even get to the bottom of the swamp, much less drain it.
[02:45:17.454 --> 02:45:30.243]  The good thing about Trump was that at least he shined a light down into that murky, mucky, fetid pool, and the light couldn't even hit the bottom.
[02:45:30.824 --> 02:45:33.085]  And now we know at least what we're up against.
[02:45:33.706 --> 02:45:36.268]  So for all his good and bad points,
[02:45:36.877 --> 02:45:39.659]  Trump fought the swamp, but the swamp won.
[02:45:39.979 --> 02:45:41.800]  There's no doubt about that now.
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:46.523]  So for four years, he was the president, but was he really in control?
[02:45:47.163 --> 02:45:48.564]  How much was he in control?
[02:45:49.244 --> 02:46:00.210]  When they were attacking the White House, his own Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chairman Milley, was saying, oh, it was a terrible mistake to defend the White House.
[02:46:00.611 --> 02:46:04.453]  But boy, you let some rioters get out of control in the Capitol.
[02:46:05.023 --> 02:46:07.184]  It's the worst thing since 9-11.
[02:46:07.664 --> 02:46:09.824]  It's the worst thing since Pearl Harbor.
[02:46:10.725 --> 02:46:13.805]  And I'm telling you, that narrative is not done.
[02:46:14.426 --> 02:46:16.706]  They need to get rid of our guns.
[02:46:16.806 --> 02:46:20.127]  They are well on their way to getting rid of the First Amendment.
[02:46:20.707 --> 02:46:23.568]  They can disappear individuals completely.
[02:46:23.588 --> 02:46:26.669]  You know, Stephen Molyneux, I used just as one example.
[02:46:28.101 --> 02:46:30.443]  And I've always thought, well, what if they overreach?
[02:46:30.483 --> 02:46:48.193]  What if they use some executive order, or in the backwash of a tragedy, like a mass shooting, they push this House Bill 127, gun registration, gun banning, and they say, oh, all your semi-automatic weapons are now illegal.
[02:46:48.953 --> 02:46:50.874]  Well, I've always thought, how could they do that?
[02:46:50.914 --> 02:46:52.315]  They can't go door to door.
[02:46:52.735 --> 02:46:53.876]  People will shoot back.
[02:46:54.476 --> 02:46:56.998]  But maybe they don't even have to go door to door.
[02:46:57.771 --> 02:47:03.056]  You'll just get a notice electronically or in the mail saying, we know you have these guns.
[02:47:03.716 --> 02:47:10.603]  If you don't come down to the police station, and they'll use the same protocols they use with the vaccinations and everything else.
[02:47:10.663 --> 02:47:12.684]  They know where you live, they know where you shop.
[02:47:13.325 --> 02:47:17.088]  Your day to turn in your guns is this day, at this place.
[02:47:17.749 --> 02:47:19.110]  These are the guns you have.
[02:47:19.811 --> 02:47:22.013]  Maybe it's not all of them, but they'll know enough.
[02:47:22.867 --> 02:47:29.549]  They've been data mining our credit cards and our emails and our private messages for years.
[02:47:29.629 --> 02:47:30.929]  They know what we've got.
[02:47:30.949 --> 02:47:30.929]  90%.
[02:47:33.550 --> 02:47:40.272]  So they say, if you don't come and turn in these guns on this day, you're going to be punished.
[02:47:40.933 --> 02:47:45.334]  And this is where I have a new concept I call the digital gulag.
[02:47:45.914 --> 02:47:48.875]  They won't need to send a team to your house to kick in your door.
[02:47:49.887 --> 02:47:52.989]  You're just going to find out that your ATM card doesn't work.
[02:47:53.849 --> 02:47:55.450]  And your credit cards don't work.
[02:47:56.830 --> 02:47:59.372]  And your cell phone dies.
[02:48:00.212 --> 02:48:03.133]  And then you can't even crowdsource.
[02:48:03.193 --> 02:48:05.254]  You can't get on Facebook.
[02:48:05.294 --> 02:48:06.555]  You can't get on YouTube.
[02:48:06.595 --> 02:48:07.796]  You can't get on Twitter.
[02:48:08.136 --> 02:48:10.077]  Nobody knows you're even alive.
[02:48:10.577 --> 02:48:12.858]  You've just digitally disappeared.
[02:48:13.778 --> 02:48:15.459]  You'll just be in your own house.
[02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:18.941]  The four walls of your house will be your gulag.
[02:48:19.747 --> 02:48:21.408]  And then who are you going to attack?
[02:48:21.748 --> 02:48:25.730]  Are you just going to go on a one-man terror campaign, as it will be perceived?
[02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:29.792]  Are you going to attack your local county commissioner or police chief?
[02:48:30.612 --> 02:48:40.897]  This is the coming digital gulag, and I haven't figured out how we're going to get around this, but it's a great risk that I see in the coming weeks, months, and years.
[02:48:41.917 --> 02:48:45.479]  And I'll talk to you next week, or see you when I see you.
[02:48:50.273 --> 02:48:51.494]  It's a little apocalyptic.
[02:48:51.514 --> 02:48:55.238]  I'm telling you, this is my Patriot Supply from ApparelAlex.com.
[02:48:55.298 --> 02:48:56.639]  It's so good, I'm in here trying to get some more.
[02:48:56.959 --> 02:48:58.440]  Zimmerman's been working 20 hours a day.
[02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:00.642]  One of the most valuable players here.
[02:49:01.795 --> 02:49:10.945]  Trying to feed people, because the power's off for most of our crew members, because we're not essential, and the grocery stores are all basically closed.
[02:49:11.005 --> 02:49:15.369]  A few essential ones, because they just decide whose grocery store can be essential, who isn't.
[02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:17.211]  This is the new planned economy.
[02:49:17.752 --> 02:49:21.776]  So now it's not just the big banks that get in on it, and big tech that doubles all its profits under the lockout.
[02:49:22.932 --> 02:49:26.896]  Now all the local groups that are essential get to get in on the fun as well.
[02:49:27.336 --> 02:49:29.999]  And then they decide, your restaurant's closed, yours is open.
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:32.481]  Your hospital's closed, yours is open.
[02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:34.043]  It's all very technocratic.
[02:49:34.083 --> 02:49:35.064]  It's all done by computer.
[02:49:35.304 --> 02:49:36.545]  It's all liberal.
[02:49:36.966 --> 02:49:38.427]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:49:40.089 --> 02:49:40.969]  I call this horrible food.
[02:49:40.989 --> 02:49:41.810]  Well, you still can.
[02:49:42.251 --> 02:49:44.052]  And it's ready to ship out from the warehouse in Utah.
[02:49:44.253 --> 02:49:44.893]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:49:45.033 --> 02:49:46.295]  Askforitsbroadcast.com.
[02:49:46.315 --> 02:49:47.115]  I won't be on air.
[02:49:49.696 --> 02:49:53.801]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[02:49:54.802 --> 02:50:03.691]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[02:50:05.123 --> 02:50:12.228]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[02:50:13.368 --> 02:50:26.517]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[02:50:28.226 --> 02:50:32.888]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[02:50:33.628 --> 02:50:43.612]  Go to infowarrestore.com and get at least a year's supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[02:50:44.653 --> 02:50:47.114]  Get your storable foods at infowarrestore.com.
[02:50:53.462 --> 02:50:55.723]  We're not going to be on the air unless we have your support.
[02:50:55.783 --> 02:50:59.085]  Plus, we've got great products that everybody already needs.
[02:50:59.345 --> 02:51:00.665]  It's been sold out for a while.
[02:51:01.206 --> 02:51:05.788]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immunity and for your body's defenses.
[02:51:06.932 --> 02:51:10.113]  It's something that's essential that everyone needs regardless.
[02:51:10.273 --> 02:51:12.654]  The globalists don't want you knowing how to protect yourself.
[02:51:12.714 --> 02:51:13.875]  A limited supply.
[02:51:14.015 --> 02:51:15.155]  A limited supply.
[02:51:15.235 --> 02:51:17.056]  Because they can't get the bottles or the caps.
[02:51:17.296 --> 02:51:18.556]  They may have changed the packaging.
[02:51:18.616 --> 02:51:19.297]  Has come in.
[02:51:19.457 --> 02:51:21.798]  It'll probably be sold out in a week at the amount we have.
[02:51:21.858 --> 02:51:23.939]  Despite that, it's 25% off.
[02:51:23.979 --> 02:51:25.519]  You take it sublingually, under the tongue.
[02:51:25.579 --> 02:51:28.640]  A lot of people, especially older folks, cannot absorb D3 in the gut.
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:33.242]  But under the tongue, if you hold it for about a minute, you get most of it, along with the vitamin K that helps with delivery.
[02:51:33.382 --> 02:51:35.083]  Ultra high quality, packaged stock.
[02:51:35.103 --> 02:51:35.563]  You can get it for
[02:51:35.803 --> 02:51:43.552]  For 40% off when you get it with Ultra 12 super high-end vitamin B12 under the tongue for maximum absorption as well.
[02:51:44.113 --> 02:51:45.274]  Made by the same great lab.
[02:51:45.294 --> 02:51:46.695]  The highest in we can get.
[02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:47.536]  I'm so proud of it.
[02:51:47.677 --> 02:51:51.841]  Ultra 12 with it is 40% off in the combo pack.
[02:51:51.941 --> 02:51:55.105]  Get Ultra 12 by itself because there's no shortage of that yet.
[02:51:55.685 --> 02:51:56.326]  4, 50% off.
[02:51:57.106 --> 02:51:58.947]  Ultra 12, 50% off by itself.
[02:51:59.047 --> 02:52:00.748]  Winter Sun, 25% by itself.
[02:52:00.768 --> 02:52:02.769]  The Tuna Combo, 40% off.
[02:52:02.889 --> 02:52:07.572]  No reviews on that because it's a brand new combo, but look at the reviews of Ultra 12 and Winter Sun by itself.
[02:52:08.052 --> 02:52:11.234]  98, 99%, thousands upon thousands of reviews.
[02:52:11.374 --> 02:52:14.275]  I can tell you this is made by the top lab in the country.
[02:52:14.295 --> 02:52:14.495]  4.9 stars.
[02:52:15.956 --> 02:52:16.797]  Limited supply.
[02:52:16.937 --> 02:52:25.602]  Separately, my dad, working with a major manufacturer, major developer, and a chemist, has launched his own line that we carry at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:52:25.662 --> 02:52:26.763]  And these are all different formulas.
[02:52:26.783 --> 02:52:29.145]  It doesn't compete with Supermelt Vitality or Alpha Power.
[02:52:29.165 --> 02:52:30.626]  It's just different and it's really strong.
[02:52:31.306 --> 02:52:34.328]  Total Male Invigoration Primal Youth.
[02:52:34.968 --> 02:52:42.312]  Available Primal Youth along with the Extra Strength Kava Gel from Dr. Jones Naturals at MFullWorthStore.com.
[02:52:42.352 --> 02:52:47.916]  That's MFullWorthStore.com or find that and other products at Dr. Jones Naturals, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:52:59.577 --> 02:53:00.798]  This is the American dream.
[02:53:01.238 --> 02:53:03.920]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:09.664]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[02:53:10.144 --> 02:53:12.045]  They have so many Americans working for them.
[02:53:12.346 --> 02:53:16.268]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[02:53:16.628 --> 02:53:19.710]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[02:53:19.751 --> 02:53:25.915]  We are funded by you supporting us at Infoworkstore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[02:53:26.255 --> 02:53:28.917]  Now again, most companies buy in bulk.
[02:53:29.777 --> 02:53:34.180]  And then they advertise and have a really high price, so they make a profit off that food.
[02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:35.881]  But they don't produce it themselves.
[02:53:36.382 --> 02:53:38.283]  They don't stockpile it fresh.
[02:53:38.863 --> 02:53:42.806]  Almost all of this is coming off the assembly line and what, being shipped out in a day or two at least?
[02:53:42.866 --> 02:53:43.446]  Absolutely.
[02:53:43.486 --> 02:53:46.308]  So this game lord right here is going to go back to our kidding team.
[02:53:46.829 --> 02:53:49.030]  By tomorrow, these pouches are going to be inside of buckets.
[02:53:49.230 --> 02:53:51.091]  And the next day, those buckets are going to be out the door.
[02:53:51.412 --> 02:53:53.253]  So Joe, tell us what we're doing right here in the factory.
[02:53:53.353 --> 02:53:55.195]  So this is our shipping station right here, Alex.
[02:53:55.235 --> 02:53:58.618]  And this is actually InfoWars orders that are going out at this very moment.
[02:53:58.638 --> 02:54:00.759]  Like this order right here for Steven.
[02:54:00.779 --> 02:54:01.960]  Steven lives in California.
[02:54:01.980 --> 02:54:05.944]  He's going to get a special autographed pick ticket from Alex Jones.
[02:54:06.064 --> 02:54:08.866]  So I want to thank you for your support, plus you're getting some great storable food.
[02:54:08.927 --> 02:54:09.987]  So I'm your Christmas elf.
[02:54:10.368 --> 02:54:12.510]  A little bit late in the year, but thank you so much for your support, brother.
[02:54:13.050 --> 02:54:17.112]  Yeah, we're shipping products, you know, hundreds of packages per day through our state-of-the-art conveyor system.
[02:54:17.532 --> 02:54:19.153]  This is really the state-of-the-art thing.
[02:54:19.253 --> 02:54:22.875]  I think Amazon is what's comparable to what we do here at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:54:23.255 --> 02:54:24.636]  This is Lynn from Alabama.
[02:54:24.656 --> 02:54:26.177]  Lynn ordered for Infowars.com.
[02:54:26.237 --> 02:54:27.478]  Her order's going out this afternoon.
[02:54:27.538 --> 02:54:29.799]  It's going to be on her truck here in the next couple of minutes.
[02:54:29.819 --> 02:54:30.999]  It's going to be on her way to land.
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:33.661]  Lynn from Alabama, we love you, we appreciate you.
[02:54:33.701 --> 02:54:35.302]  You made the right choice with this affordable food.
[02:54:35.322 --> 02:54:36.702]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:54:37.063 --> 02:54:38.503]  And when did they put this order in?
[02:54:38.523 --> 02:54:39.524]  I want to see how fast it's going out.
[02:54:39.892 --> 02:54:44.053]  You know, this order was actually put in, I think, two days ago, and it's already going out the door right now.
[02:54:44.073 --> 02:54:49.335]  So, two days ago, fresh food produced, packaged right here in America, the whole nine yards.
[02:54:49.395 --> 02:54:50.555]  This is the American dream.
[02:54:50.595 --> 02:54:57.037]  This is America capitalism bringing us exceptionalism, bringing us more choices, and we thank you for keeping us on the air.
[02:54:57.217 --> 02:54:57.897]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:58.857 --> 02:55:04.359]  I've ordered a lot of high-quality food from you guys over the years, but it just gets better and better tasting, and the selection is so huge.
[02:55:04.799 --> 02:55:05.959]  And I was just walking around in here.
[02:55:06.019 --> 02:55:09.040]  How many different variants and products do you have?
[02:55:10.267 --> 02:55:11.588]  We have hundreds of different products.
[02:55:11.648 --> 02:55:16.750]  And you know, when you're talking about food, I mean freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, freeze-dried meats, ready-made meals.
[02:55:16.810 --> 02:55:22.992]  Just the ready-made meals that we have, the ones that come inside of the four-week kit, there's going to be at least 18 different varieties that we offer.
[02:55:23.112 --> 02:55:27.294]  And we keep expanding that as we do more research, as we do more configurations.
[02:55:27.314 --> 02:55:28.775]  We're going to be adding different meals.
[02:55:28.795 --> 02:55:31.016]  Your food was great 12 years ago, but now it's amazing.
[02:55:31.056 --> 02:55:34.297]  Chicken noodle, vegetarian taco, potato, cheese.
[02:55:34.717 --> 02:55:42.139]  Peasy broccoli rice, brown sugar oatmeal, potato cheddar, peanut butter, corn chowder, white rice, sugar.
[02:55:42.159 --> 02:55:47.560]  You've got wheat honey bread, whey milk, you'll have traveler stew, chicken noodle.
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:48.541]  Oh, I like traveler stew.
[02:55:48.721 --> 02:55:50.521]  Traveler stew is one of our more popular ones.
[02:55:50.541 --> 02:55:51.722]  Chicken noodle, it's excellent.
[02:55:52.002 --> 02:55:52.182]  Yep.
[02:55:52.362 --> 02:55:56.903]  I mean, we have almost anything that you would eat on a regular basis packaged in the long-term food stores.
[02:55:56.943 --> 02:55:57.763]  They've got everything, folks.
[02:55:57.783 --> 02:55:59.504]  You've got to check it out at impolarstore.com.
[02:55:59.724 --> 02:56:00.744]  The entire selection there.
[02:56:01.064 --> 02:56:04.928]  Literally, within a day or two of your order coming in, it's being shipped out to you.
[02:56:05.248 --> 02:56:08.091]  If it's local, in Utah, it's on those small trucks.
[02:56:08.491 --> 02:56:10.513]  If it's outside Utah, it's on big 18 wheelers.
[02:56:10.533 --> 02:56:15.178]  Again, that's why MyPatriot with ReadyHour has become the number one serval food company in the world.
[02:56:15.378 --> 02:56:20.503]  Because of quality, because of service, because of reliability, and because of good word of mouth.
[02:56:20.523 --> 02:56:24.467]  So I want to thank you all for supporting us and supporting our great supplier, MyPatriot.
[02:56:36.418 --> 02:56:40.042]  Right here in America and it funds the InfoWars.
[02:56:40.062 --> 02:56:42.304]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get prepared!
