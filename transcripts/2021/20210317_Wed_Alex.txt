[00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:02.015]  12 years to doomsday.
[00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.496]  She was told to say that.
[00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:05.916]  Why?
[00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:16.240]  Why was Al Gore out there saying 20 years ago that by 2017 we'd all be underwater, but buying multiple houses on beachfront that are still there fine today?
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.962]  Because they're teaching you that you're going to have the end of the world, that you're going to be non-essential, that you're going to die.
[00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:24.182]  They're going to go on.
[00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:28.784]  But they are creating an apocalypse in the third world, and an apocalypse
[00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:33.857]  For everyone else, and yes, it came out of a UN report in 2018.
[00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:43.682]  So I'm going to be laying all of this out today in great detail.
[00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:49.885]  And I walked in here intending to do the headline, Globalist Plan.
[00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:53.058]  The controlled end of the world by 2030.
[00:00:53.359 --> 00:01:00.630]  I told my wife as I walked out of the house, I said, I have just received the biggest download I've ever gotten on the hike I had just done.
[00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:01.912]  She said, what do you mean?
[00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:04.216]  And I said, they're going to stage the end of the world in 2030.
[00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.852]  And she didn't think I was crazy because she's seen me do this all the time.
[00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:14.053]  And it was just everything lining up.
[00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.535]  And then I come in here and it's on the damn screen.
[00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.916]  Exactly what I was intending to tell the crew to do.
[00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:22.517]  That is the spirit.
[00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:25.119]  That's what their AI can't beat.
[00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:26.900]  It's what their 5G can't beat.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.941]  It's what all their surveillance can't beat.
[00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.502]  Because God's real.
[00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:32.443]  And we are all interconnected.
[00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:37.625]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:52.951]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.352]  You better believe you got one!
[00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:02.757]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.456]  Don't let the enemy get you depressed about what's happening today.
[00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:35.787]  As long as you're speaking up, as long as you're standing up, as long as you're saying no to the globalists, as long as you're living and loving your neighbors and being a good person, you're building the human community that is the American Dream, that is the Renaissance.
[00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.909]  1776 is the answer to 1984! 1776!
[00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:57.061]  1776!
[00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:57.061]  1776!
[00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:57.061]  1776!
[00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:57.061]  1776!
[00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:57.061]  And this Irishman, who's now an American, he said, listen, you don't get Joe Biden's name right.
[00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:58.602]  He's a stooge.
[00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:00.283]  And I said, wow, you're right.
[00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:07.027]  A stooge is a puppet put in by somebody else who's an idiot, but who's also used to rule over people.
[00:03:07.447 --> 00:03:08.868]  So the stooge gets the blame.
[00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.571]  And the actual controllers don't get to blame for the crimes they're committed.
[00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.593]  They said that's exactly right.
[00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:15.493]  He is a puppet.
[00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:16.835]  He is an imposter.
[00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:17.956]  He is a fraud.
[00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:23.501]  So everybody should look at the different definitions of stooges and understand what that is.
[00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:24.281]  That's what he is.
[00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:36.053]  So I want to thank you both and I want to thank the former general, I keep calling him general, the guy who runs that outfit over there.
[00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:46.543]  I want to make sure we thank the Secretary for all he's done to try to implement what we just talked about and for recommending these two women.
[00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:49.066]  Aroha, amigos!
[00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:51.888]  It's me, Fentanyl the Dragon.
[00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:58.472]  I am named after the product that my bosses, CCP, bring into your country.
[00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:09.119]  We will talk about Fentanyl in a moment, but first the cover hoax that I launched with your Bill Gates, and of course, Klaus Schwab on you, a year ago.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.241]  And now you see what happens.
[00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:16.804]  You are in fear to leave your home, and Marvel's Marvin Hagler took Charlie Dyke.
[00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:20.105]  Ah, just like your Hank Aaron.
[00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:23.026]  He said take the shot to protect other people.
[00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.627]  But now it's admitted it does not protect you from COVID.
[00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.607]  And Fauci, good Fauci, good.
[00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.768]  He says you still can't go out and have the vaccine.
[00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:35.909]  You must social distance and stay closed.
[00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:37.649]  And Canada say the same thing.
[00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.689]  You say it, UK.
[00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:42.990]  Australia, because I design plan, ah.
[00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:52.669]  That stands for Stupid Americans!
[00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.671]  You collapse, while China stay open, make more billionaires and the whole world combine!
[00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:02.132]  We control your government!
[00:05:02.152 --> 00:05:03.572]  We are collapsing your nation!
[00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.533]  Nothing can stand against us!
[00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:07.873]  And your people take our shots and die!
[00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:09.354]  Die Americans!
[00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:10.394]  Die!
[00:05:10.634 --> 00:05:12.055]  CCP will rule you!
[00:05:15.203 --> 00:05:22.389]  And now that Biden has been in Congress for two months, he banned your border patrol.
[00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:32.478]  So the deadly poison fentanyl, with one grain that can kill you, is pouring in at 360% levels above Trump.
[00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.841]  Your tent cities are spreading too.
[00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:39.084]  And now your pregnant women fly combat missions.
[00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:42.206]  And I will have sex change for your little boy.
[00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:51.474]  Now finally this evening, it is important to agree with Brian Stelter that no one is allowed to have free speech like Tucker Carlson.
[00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:53.815]  He should be taken off the airwaves.
[00:05:54.215 --> 00:06:00.279]  And the Grammys, they do not need to wear masks while they teach you to throw Marlowe cocktails at police.
[00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.979]  No.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:12.086]  And you need to also understand that Swiss officials blame not taking vaccines for COVID even though it admits that vaccines are causing mutations and spreading COVID.
[00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:16.248]  Good American, shut your mouth.
[00:06:16.748 --> 00:06:18.749]  Take your shot and die.
[00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.491]  Cut your son's genitals off.
[00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:24.413]  Tell your little girl they're a boy.
[00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:27.215]  Time to run you now, roll over and die.
[00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:29.677]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hello, hi.
[00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:32.118]  We run your people, we run you too.
[00:06:32.138 --> 00:06:34.900]  So do what we say and we're gonna kill you too.
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.482]  I tell you again, I'll say it last time.
[00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:40.084]  Info Wars is not good.
[00:06:40.444 --> 00:06:42.725]  Bad Info Wars, Bad Info Wars.
[00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:45.507]  Oh, no, no, no!
[00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:48.147]  I don't even know what this is!
[00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:49.468]  How do I get in here?
[00:06:50.848 --> 00:06:52.949]  I just caught you, American!
[00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.310]  You visited Bandar Video!
[00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.471]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:05.573]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[00:07:08.654 --> 00:07:10.455]  Conflict!
[00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:12.996]  It comes from China.
[00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:55.412]  Infowars.
[00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:59.214]  Because there is a war on.
[00:07:59.774 --> 00:08:00.134]  For.
[00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:06.036]  Your.
[00:08:06.136 --> 00:08:09.917]  Mind.
[00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:17.139]  I do not say this on air for dramatic effect.
[00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.620]  I say it because it's the truth.
[00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.793]  We have absolutely gone into the zeitgeist we are in, for lack of a better word, revelations.
[00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:38.659]  And this morning I was out for a hike and had the blood pumping through my brain and I just had 30 minutes of complete and total clarity.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:49.632]  And then driving into the office, I recorded about a 20 minute breakdown of what I'm about to lay out again, but it was very calm how I did it and very cogent.
[00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:58.182]  And so I am going to have that put down to a video file with a few documents and a few video clips, but I'm going to air it.
[00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:04.780]  I'm going to air it at the bottom of the next hour, in about an hour and 25 minutes.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:15.302]  It'll take two segments to air, and I'm going to talk about it ahead of time, but everything I'm about to say is documented, and it's on record.
[00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:21.823]  But they know that it's so scary, you're not going to want to admit it to yourself, and so they believe you won't take action against it.
[00:09:23.204 --> 00:09:29.365]  But the live show headline, going live as we speak, is global exclusive, world exclusive.
[00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:44.983]  Globalist planning, in quotes, controlled end of the world in 2030.
[00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:55.558]  That's the Wednesday live show for the American Journal that did a fabulous job this morning with Harrison Smith.
[00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:57.559]  In fact, let's put that headline back up for folks.
[00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:58.379]  That's important as well.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.782]  Wednesday live, EU demands vaccine passports for free movement across Europe.
[00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:08.905]  That's the mark of the beast, which they admit is the total control system to buy or sell and the social credit score.
[00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:11.406]  And that just dovetails with what we're talking about.
[00:10:12.687 --> 00:10:18.070]  We're now entering the time, in fact, we have entered the time where everything is just going to be out in the open now.
[00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:26.789]  I have an article right here that a national talk show host sent me minutes before I went live.
[00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:32.510]  And the reason I mention that is not name-dropping, it's to point out that God has put me in the zeitgeist.
[00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.731]  It's insane.
[00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:35.311]  I can pick the phone up and call Trump.
[00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:37.491]  I can pick the phone up and call Tucker Carlson.
[00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.332]  I can pick the phone up and call General Flynn.
[00:10:40.632 --> 00:10:43.113]  I can pick the phone up and call Joe Rogan.
[00:10:43.473 --> 00:10:46.974]  I can pick the phone up and call basically anybody.
[00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.011]  That's on the good guy side.
[00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:51.513]  It's just an incredible responsibility.
[00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.854]  I was just sent this before I went live.
[00:10:53.735 --> 00:11:01.221]  Transgender activist makes argument for all children to be put on puberty blockers until they can determine the identity.
[00:11:02.657 --> 00:11:03.878]  Puberty blockers are toxic.
[00:11:03.918 --> 00:11:04.659]  They kill a lot of people.
[00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:05.881]  They cause massive depression.
[00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:10.265]  So imagine we're going to put you into this system that basically sterilizes you if you're a boy.
[00:11:10.385 --> 00:11:11.487]  It makes you closer to a girl.
[00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:13.409]  That's what these monsters are.
[00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:14.210]  That's their endgame.
[00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.910]  That's their goal.
[00:11:15.231 --> 00:11:17.854]  And no one's allowed to criticize them because it's a scientific takeover.
[00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:22.499]  So let me best as I can lay this out to you.
[00:11:28.953 --> 00:11:38.257]  When you see AOC and you see Beto O'Rourke with tears in their eyes, looking like they completely believe it, saying, the world is going to be over in 12 years.
[00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:41.779]  They said that in 2019.
[00:11:41.819 --> 00:11:44.520]  Then in 2020, they said the world is going to be over in 11 years.
[00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:46.902]  What are they counting down to?
[00:11:47.282 --> 00:11:49.083]  Who told them this as a talking point?
[00:11:49.283 --> 00:11:50.203]  These are total puppets.
[00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:52.084]  They don't know why they're saying it.
[00:11:52.104 --> 00:11:52.664]  They're told to.
[00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:55.065]  Well, we know who told them.
[00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.266]  I'm going to break it down.
[00:11:57.687 --> 00:11:57.867]  But
[00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:00.885]  Why are they telling us it's the end of the world?
[00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:02.286]  The end of the world as we know it.
[00:12:02.686 --> 00:12:04.146]  A controlled end of the world.
[00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:05.346]  A new world.
[00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:06.646]  A silicon world.
[00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:08.047]  A post-carbon world.
[00:12:09.407 --> 00:12:14.148]  Beware those that worship AI gods, as Elon Musk said two years ago.
[00:12:18.149 --> 00:12:21.529]  Because if you look at Agenda 2030, end poverty, end cancer,
[00:12:26.514 --> 00:12:31.338]  End everything by 2030, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it because you'll be dead.
[00:12:37.383 --> 00:12:37.964]  Think about that.
[00:12:37.984 --> 00:12:40.846]  12 years to doomsday.
[00:12:43.108 --> 00:12:44.329]  She was told to say that.
[00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.749]  Why?
[00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:55.038]  Why was Al Gore out there saying 20 years ago that by 2017 we'd all be underwater, but buying multiple houses on beachfront that are still there fine today?
[00:12:56.141 --> 00:13:01.764]  Because they're teaching you that you're going to have the end of the world, that you're going to be non-essential, that you're going to die.
[00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:10.168]  They're going to go on, but they are creating an apocalypse in the third world and an apocalypse for everyone else.
[00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:13.369]  And yes, it came out of a UN report in 2018.
[00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:22.454]  So I'm going to be laying all of this out today in great detail.
[00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:32.666]  I'm going to be breaking it all down, and how this controlled apocalypse is going to unfold.
[00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:42.131]  And you have to understand, when I tell you this, this is what they've already said, it's what they're already doing, this is the journey we're on.
[00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:50.715]  It's like you're driving up the highway and you're in Flagstaff, Arizona, and you know in another 50, 60 miles you're going to be at the Grand Canyon.
[00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:53.260]  And how do you know?
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.561]  Because that's where the map goes.
[00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:55.482]  That's where the road is.
[00:13:55.822 --> 00:13:57.063]  I've been there five or six times.
[00:13:57.123 --> 00:13:57.664]  I can tell you.
[00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:01.367]  You've probably been there.
[00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:02.128]  You know that's true.
[00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:11.256]  Well, the same thing is I've been on this road studying the globalists, watching them plan, watching them make announcements, watching them do things for 35 years, but on air 27.
[00:14:15.484 --> 00:14:17.606]  And they are taking us there.
[00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:19.847]  We are going to this place.
[00:14:20.328 --> 00:14:21.389]  But what do they talk about?
[00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:27.654]  Their main mission first with TV and cartoons in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s was to take our attention span.
[00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:34.039]  The average American's attention span was over an hour long of deep focused attention.
[00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:38.582]  The people made a lot less decisions back then too.
[00:14:39.843 --> 00:14:44.487]  You make more decisions when you've been up for an hour in the morning than a person a thousand years ago made in a week.
[00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:48.366]  So it becomes very unconscious.
[00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.827]  And the average attention span is less than 14 seconds.
[00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:56.590]  A goldfish's attention span is 15.2 seconds long.
[00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:57.130]  Look it up.
[00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.811]  The average species.
[00:14:59.111 --> 00:15:00.312]  Some are 17, some are 12.
[00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:13.238]  The average westerner has less attention span than a goldfish, so they may have a native intelligence, but their subconscious brain and their conscious brain have basically been merged where they're like jellyfish.
[00:15:14.974 --> 00:15:19.397]  They're in a trance, and the sleeper must awaken.
[00:15:20.097 --> 00:15:27.262]  That's why when you tune in to NPR, or you listen to a politician, they talk very, very slowly.
[00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:31.284]  And they talk very, very softly.
[00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:38.008]  And they don't want anyone on NPR that talks in an excited voice, because what does an excited voice do?
[00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:39.409]  What does that do?
[00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.450]  It wakes people up!
[00:15:42.631 --> 00:15:43.912]  Wake up!
[00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:46.329]  Come out of your trance!
[00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:53.078]  They don't want to have a yelling voice in the night to warn you while you're slumbering to your destruction.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.802]  Or going over the edge of the waterfall.
[00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:01.792]  And they sure as hell don't want a big cold bucket of water thrown on you of reality.
[00:16:02.092 --> 00:16:03.652]  So everything they do is incremental.
[00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:15.475]  But even in incrementalism, there is a creep, and then a walk, and then a jog, and then a run, and then a sprint, and then an all-out bum rush.
[00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:19.436]  And we're now in the jog.
[00:16:20.696 --> 00:16:21.936]  And now you're gonna hit the run.
[00:16:22.756 --> 00:16:24.077]  And then you're gonna hit death.
[00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:26.037]  So it's here.
[00:16:27.481 --> 00:16:28.622]  And you will not escape it.
[00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:30.243]  You will go through it.
[00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:31.964]  And it's real.
[00:16:32.384 --> 00:16:33.325]  And they're coming to kill you.
[00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:34.185]  They're coming to kill me.
[00:16:35.006 --> 00:16:37.107]  And almost everybody that serves it is dead as well.
[00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:40.670]  But humanity will rally in the end and defeat it.
[00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.351]  But it's going to be rough.
[00:16:43.948 --> 00:16:47.151]  I explain why they're doing this and more in a 20-minute report I taped.
[00:16:47.772 --> 00:16:48.813]  It's being put together now.
[00:16:49.073 --> 00:16:52.637]  I'll also do it on air, but I think I really settled down and got it pretty much all covered.
[00:16:53.198 --> 00:16:54.159]  That's coming up later.
[00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:54.679]  Stay with us.
[00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.021]  InfoWars.com.
[00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:58.503]  It'll probably only be on the air for a limited time.
[00:16:58.543 --> 00:16:58.984]  Just so you know.
[00:16:59.464 --> 00:17:04.830]  So, the globalists are afraid of humans discovering the real power.
[00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:08.513]  And there's a great change taking place in the population.
[00:17:09.014 --> 00:17:12.556]  Some are falling away from their connection to God and the spiritual.
[00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:15.097]  Others are coming closer.
[00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:20.901]  And so let me give you an example of the way there's synchronicities and serendipities in the world.
[00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:21.821]  And we all know they're real.
[00:17:22.222 --> 00:17:23.182]  We've all experienced it.
[00:17:23.682 --> 00:17:25.223]  We've all had dreams that come true.
[00:17:25.804 --> 00:17:27.204]  We've all had nightmares that come true.
[00:17:27.265 --> 00:17:29.566]  We've all had premonitions and they come true.
[00:17:29.606 --> 00:17:31.147]  We've all said, hey, let's visit grandma.
[00:17:31.227 --> 00:17:32.047]  I'm worried about grandma.
[00:17:32.307 --> 00:17:33.648]  Phone rings, grandma just died.
[00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:34.689]  That actually happened with me.
[00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:47.703]  This morning, I cut an audio recording dealing with the Globalist's plan to have a staged end-of-the-world event on or around 2030, and I'm totally sure of it, and I have the proof.
[00:17:47.723 --> 00:17:48.584]  I'll show you coming up.
[00:17:49.824 --> 00:18:01.153]  When I thought about it, I thought, I'll just put the graphic of the satellite footage of the Earth from orbit over that, and I said, I'm going to have them do that as the background today.
[00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:15.970]  And I swear on everything I am, on my heart, on my soul, that when I walked into this building this morning, I looked up and they were punching up this background of a satellite of the Earth.
[00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.710]  We probably do this twice a year.
[00:18:20.112 --> 00:18:25.615]  And I walked in here intending to do the headline, Globalist Plan.
[00:18:27.213 --> 00:18:28.775]  The controlled end of the world by 2030.
[00:18:29.076 --> 00:18:36.347]  I told my wife as I walked out of the house, I said, I have just received the biggest download I've ever gotten on the hike I had just done.
[00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:37.629]  She said, what do you mean?
[00:18:37.689 --> 00:18:39.933]  And I said, they're going to stage the end of the world in 2030.
[00:18:44.884 --> 00:18:47.565]  And she didn't think I was crazy because she's seen me do this all the time.
[00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:53.266]  And it was just everything lining up and then I come in here and it's on the damn screen.
[00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:56.647]  Exactly what I was intending to tell the crew to do.
[00:18:56.847 --> 00:18:58.227]  That is the spirit.
[00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:00.848]  That's what their AI can't beat.
[00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:02.628]  It's what their 5G can't beat.
[00:19:03.048 --> 00:19:08.150]  It's what all their surveillance can't beat because God's real and we are all interconnected.
[00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.811]  How do you think a monarch butterfly knows how to fly
[00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:21.997]  All the way to Canada, lay eggs, die, and then a monarch flies all the way back down to central Mexico.
[00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:35.972]  How do you think a hummingbird knows how to be in North Carolina and fly all the way down across Florida, all the way to South America and have babies, and then fly back and do it five, six times in its life?
[00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.029]  I mean, what's, did somebody teach it?
[00:19:41.089 --> 00:19:58.358]  No, it's electrochemical, electromagnetic, and it's connected to everything, and we have cone cells in our brains that are actually electromagnetic, and that are receiving, and they're not just receiving the magnetic lines of the earth, they're not just receiving the sun, they are receiving
[00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:04.220]  Other energies and other transmission systems that have now been measured and read.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.361]  And again, it's all over mainstream news.
[00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:09.944]  They admit there is a force five times stronger than our reality.
[00:20:10.624 --> 00:20:12.966]  They call it dark matter, but it's not dark matter.
[00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:17.168]  It's another more powerful universe holding us in place.
[00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:20.651]  An energy field is holding us in place.
[00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:25.974]  And they don't want us tapping into that energy field.
[00:20:25.994 --> 00:20:26.835]  They don't want us together.
[00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:29.333]  Because we come together in a church.
[00:20:29.713 --> 00:20:35.455]  Oh, we can come together in a church and take our vaccine, come together in a church, think that white people are racist, come together and create evil.
[00:20:35.635 --> 00:20:36.216]  That's not a church.
[00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:38.056]  It's a demonic conclave.
[00:20:38.797 --> 00:20:42.818]  But people go to a church wanting to find God, wanting to be good, wanting something greater.
[00:20:42.938 --> 00:20:45.359]  And in that, they come together and the globalists hate that.
[00:20:45.379 --> 00:20:48.861]  That's why, oh no, the topless bar stays open, the liquor store stays open.
[00:20:51.348 --> 00:21:01.897]  All the other things stay open, but not those churches, because they want the power to shut down those gatherings, because what the Bible says is what two agree upon on earth, God makes in heaven.
[00:21:04.459 --> 00:21:09.083]  So there it is, world exclusive, globalist plan controlled into the world by 2030.
[00:21:09.243 --> 00:21:14.407]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:19.312]  And driving into work today, I laid that out.
[00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:20.572]  I don't know.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.702]  The poorest people on earth are folks like Bill Gates, and Ted Turner, and Oprah Winfrey.
[00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:46.482]  They are totally turned over to evil.
[00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:47.803]  They are servants of evil.
[00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:51.084]  So if you don't even have a car, or you're broke down, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:51.164 --> 00:22:06.589]  If you love God, and you have a connection to God, and you can see the beauty of a sunset, and you appreciate God for creating you, and you can be nice to others, and you can be a decent person, and you can stand up to evil, then you are richer than the richest kings of the earth that ever existed.
[00:22:09.986 --> 00:22:29.713]  And so I have a lot of news to cover, and a lot of horrible things that are going on, and now the enemy is completely out in the open, and I have to do this, but I want to be measured in it, and I want to be correct in it, because I have a lot of feelings to do with this, and a lot of intellectual views, and just a lot of things.
[00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:33.394]  I don't say what I say on air to curry favor with you.
[00:22:33.994 --> 00:22:38.055]  I don't do the things I do on air to make money, things like that.
[00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:39.336]  There's been false statements said that
[00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:43.684]  I supported Trump because I made money supporting Trump.
[00:22:43.724 --> 00:22:44.665]  It's been the opposite.
[00:22:44.705 --> 00:22:52.710]  Since Trump got in, we've almost been shut down and seen our funding dwindle massively in lawsuits and just every other thing.
[00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:59.996]  But I knew Trump had globalist enemies, and I knew that they hated him, and I wanted to fix things, and I wanted to believe in it.
[00:23:00.236 --> 00:23:02.037]  And I don't think Trump himself is a bad person.
[00:23:02.057 --> 00:23:05.560]  I know people that know him very well, but he's limited.
[00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.691]  And he's not this big, giant, 4-D chess guy that everybody says he is.
[00:23:10.032 --> 00:23:11.332]  He just goes with what he thinks is right.
[00:23:11.672 --> 00:23:17.095]  And he also is way too optimistic and buys too much into science when it's globalist science.
[00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:25.419]  And, you know, all the stuff they gave him, the Randesivir and the rest of it, and the gene therapies made him feel so great, he's now on board with everything they did.
[00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:32.182]  He has come out and gone on Fox News and endorsed these killer vaccines and
[00:23:33.695 --> 00:23:43.623]  After you've seen 25 countries in Europe ban it now, and hundreds around the world, and all the deaths and all the problems, that the only way to get through to Trump is to get in his face about this.
[00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:45.064]  So I'm going to reach out to Trump.
[00:23:45.225 --> 00:24:01.138]  I'm going to, because I can get a hold of him if I need to, and I'm going to communicate with him here on air, and I'm going to call his son up, and I'm just going to say, here's the evidence, and if you continue to say this is wonderful and this is good, and there's, quote, no problems, you're a bad guy, and I'm going to be against you.
[00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:02.359]  So that's that.
[00:24:02.987 --> 00:24:04.508]  I understand he wanted to reopen the economy.
[00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:09.451]  He thought, okay, if it's just a vaccine, you know, you shouldn't be made to take it, he said, but if you want it, get it.
[00:24:10.711 --> 00:24:12.953]  I'm like, well, that's still bad, but I understand what he's doing.
[00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:14.814]  I don't agree with it, but I see his perspective.
[00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:17.075]  Now he's like, everybody needs to get it.
[00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:22.780]  So he's doubling down because he signed on to this, and it's a disaster, it's a fiasco.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.344]  It's designed to get people that signed on to it to get into trouble, and so to double down.
[00:24:27.564 --> 00:24:28.365]  I said that last year.
[00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:32.829]  Once you're signed on to it, now you're gonna try to cover up all the horror because you feel bad.
[00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:36.572]  And Trump's taking the bait, and he's going down the tubes with this.
[00:24:38.013 --> 00:24:41.296]  So that's my view on this, and I'm gonna speak more to it by the clip.
[00:24:41.677 --> 00:24:43.158]  It is nauseating.
[00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:45.320]  It is disgusting.
[00:24:46.724 --> 00:24:48.986]  And obviously, Trump's good saying control our borders.
[00:24:49.206 --> 00:24:51.427]  Trump's good saying China's screwing us and fentanyl's bad.
[00:24:51.808 --> 00:25:03.016]  But all of that pales in significance to everyone being basically forced to take something that they admit is going to cause autoimmune disorders, cancer, destroy your immunity, implants you with all these viruses.
[00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:05.277]  I mean, I've got all the mainline literature here.
[00:25:05.477 --> 00:25:06.978]  This isn't just some, like, kooky groups.
[00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:12.282]  They're even having mainline scientists in prestigious cancer research facilities saying, what are you doing?
[00:25:12.562 --> 00:25:15.444]  Big pro-vaccine scientists are saying don't do this.
[00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:23.390]  But I figured out why they're doing it, because everybody gets on board, then when it causes mass death, everyone then gets involved and says, we're for the death.
[00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.671]  The Nazis called that the cement of blood.
[00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:29.874]  If you got somebody to commit a crime, then they were always basically wedded to you.
[00:25:29.954 --> 00:25:32.296]  It's a gang initiation, and I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:25:32.596 --> 00:25:35.498]  So Trump, you're going down the wrong road, buddy boy.
[00:25:36.078 --> 00:25:38.720]  The globalists are satanically inspired.
[00:25:40.441 --> 00:25:42.803]  But we're inspired by God that built the universe.
[00:25:42.823 --> 00:25:45.524]  So we need to remember, we've got the ace in the hole.
[00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:48.327]  A little secret that we need to tell people about.
[00:25:49.808 --> 00:25:51.130]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:57.136]  Alright, I'm gonna talk about Trump and really for me what will become the last straw.
[00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:09.629]  It doesn't mean that I won't say he's good on topics we should take over the Republican Party and we need his energy and boy he called up and congratulated my wife when we got married and all that great stuff.
[00:26:12.042 --> 00:26:17.604]  And boy, pat me on the head and told me I'm the greatest broadcaster and I'm gonna take over for Rush Limbaugh and how wonderful.
[00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:18.785]  I don't care about all that.
[00:26:21.606 --> 00:26:32.050]  What I care about is Trump, as now we know these vaccines are just as deadly as we thought with hindsight, coming out and saying it's safe, everybody needs to take it.
[00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.091]  That is, I think they have a word for that, balderdash?
[00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:38.232]  BS?
[00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:47.275]  And so it's not fair to criticize Joe Biden, who's absolutely a crypt keeper, slave of the New World Order.
[00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:49.237]  It's not right to criticize all these people.
[00:26:49.277 --> 00:26:56.841]  And then to have him out there when Joe Biden and Fauci said last week, we need Trump to tell his people to take this.
[00:26:58.582 --> 00:26:59.423]  And then Trump does it.
[00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:00.824]  It's just disgusting.
[00:27:02.717 --> 00:27:06.539]  And so I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but this is pretty damn close here.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.463]  All right, before I go any further, because I want to hit this AOC stuff, it's really key to this, understanding all this.
[00:27:14.024 --> 00:27:17.086]  This is the last day to get store-wide free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:21.028]  It's the last day to get store-wide free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:21.048 --> 00:27:28.753]  That means on water filters, that means on storable food, that means on t-shirts, that means on books, that means on the supplements, that means everything.
[00:27:30.452 --> 00:27:36.437]  Because I'm not Amazon that's quartered the market and gets all these government subsidies and, you know, has hundreds of warehouses and all this.
[00:27:36.537 --> 00:27:38.658]  We can't fund ourselves if we do free shipping all the time.
[00:27:39.859 --> 00:27:41.961]  We have inexpensive, you know, good quality shipping.
[00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:43.822]  It's just that we just can't do it all the time.
[00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:45.304]  So that's going to have to end today.
[00:27:45.324 --> 00:27:49.687]  So if there's something you want at InfoWars, you want to get a great product to support us, please do it today.
[00:27:50.428 --> 00:27:53.430]  Also, a bunch of the items are very close to selling out.
[00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:55.632]  So we're going to take them off sale.
[00:27:57.233 --> 00:28:00.455]  We've got Survival Shield X, 250% off, it's going to go off that sale.
[00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:03.237]  Turbo Vitality, 40% off, it's going to go off sale.
[00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:07.080]  Knockout Sleep Support, 40% off, it's going to go off sale with free shipping.
[00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:15.927]  Ultimate Krill Oil, 40% off, it's about to sell out, so we're going to just, it'll be months until we get more, so it'll go back to like 25% off, not 40% off, free shipping.
[00:28:16.287 --> 00:28:22.311]  Ultra 12, highest quality mid-12 you're going to find under the tongue, so good for your entire body, every cell you've got, immune system, you name it.
[00:28:23.152 --> 00:28:24.153]  It's just incredible.
[00:28:25.113 --> 00:28:27.455]  50% off, plus free shipping and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:30.116]  I mean, everything on the site, free shipping and massive discounts.
[00:28:30.136 --> 00:28:30.617]  That's going to end.
[00:28:31.057 --> 00:28:32.638]  What will still be on sale tomorrow?
[00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:36.636]  Well, that's RainForce Plus, the great nootropic.
[00:28:37.156 --> 00:28:46.522]  All the known herbs and natural compounds that are known to give you clarity, focused mental energy, but without the crash is in RainForce Plus.
[00:28:46.582 --> 00:28:50.025]  It stacks great with TurboForce, but be careful, it's powerful.
[00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:51.286]  It's back in stock.
[00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:55.508]  It's been sold out for months, 50% off and free shipping, and that will continue.
[00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:57.510]  It'll still have free shipping selectively.
[00:28:59.258 --> 00:28:59.898]  On that product.
[00:28:59.918 --> 00:29:01.799]  We're also selling out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:05.821]  It'll be a long time until we get more of that in because of the supply chain breakdowns, but it's still discounted.
[00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:07.281]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:29:07.922 --> 00:29:09.522]  Okay, so there you go.
[00:29:09.542 --> 00:29:11.483]  You can also get a F. Biden shirt.
[00:29:12.263 --> 00:29:13.984]  And look, I know it's crass for a lot of our listeners.
[00:29:14.004 --> 00:29:14.804]  We're in a war, okay?
[00:29:15.485 --> 00:29:15.625]  So...
[00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:31.396]  It's like Apocalypse Now, which was based on a lot of real true stories that they took out of literature and then added to true stories that happened in war, where there were real cases in Vietnam where they had them dropping napalm on villages, but they'd tell them, don't put cuss words on the side of the airplane.
[00:29:33.077 --> 00:29:37.158]  So we train our men to drop fire on the villages, but you can't have cuss words on the side of the airplane.
[00:29:37.478 --> 00:29:38.179]  It's bleeped out.
[00:29:38.199 --> 00:29:41.400]  It just says FK Biden, FK mask, FK.
[00:29:43.439 --> 00:29:44.060]  What's the other thing?
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.701]  There's three shirts.
[00:29:44.881 --> 00:29:48.266]  FK Biden, FK Fauci, FK Gates.
[00:29:49.148 --> 00:29:53.154]  And it's a very popular shirt, and it's a long-sleeve shirt, and people love it.
[00:29:53.174 --> 00:29:55.678]  It's a baseball-style shirt, and in fullwarestore.com.
[00:29:56.018 --> 00:29:57.861]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:07.973]  And I'm going to just tell you something here, that when I say I don't feel worthy to cover this, we cover so much huge news continually.
[00:30:07.993 --> 00:30:13.635]  It's just critical for me and you and all of us to continually, constantly realize how huge this is.
[00:30:15.115 --> 00:30:18.156]  Because it's easy to get live on air and cover a lot of stuff because it's live.
[00:30:18.777 --> 00:30:25.539]  But if I produce slick reports on this, it would get 10 times the views online, it would actually change the world.
[00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.051]  And an example is this.
[00:30:29.211 --> 00:30:30.653]  I was given this over a month ago.
[00:30:30.673 --> 00:30:31.734]  I didn't know about this.
[00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:32.875]  I learn stuff all the time.
[00:30:34.156 --> 00:30:43.665]  I finally have read, because it took me a month off and on, spending 30 minutes here, 20 minutes there, 10 minutes here, to read this entire folder.
[00:30:46.232 --> 00:30:51.477]  And I've asked Greg Reese, one of our best researchers, to do a report on this.
[00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:55.020]  I've asked everybody else that has time, you know, stay up here late, whatever.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:01.746]  Everyone should do different reports on this because every time I read this, because I probably read this whole stack three times.
[00:31:02.426 --> 00:31:05.008]  I probably looked at it 20 times and just scanned through it.
[00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:11.054]  Every time I look at this, I find new stuff because, you know, you get mentally exhausted.
[00:31:12.432 --> 00:31:13.732]  When you're reading scientific documents.
[00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:20.014]  And this is a small portion, this is probably 150 pages or more, on Crimson Contagion.
[00:31:21.674 --> 00:31:36.518]  I did 10 minutes with Owen Schroer yesterday, that's in the Owen Schroer section of Banned.Video, and that's the first boil down I've done, but it is, to say bombshell, we ought to call this show bombshell, because mainstream media is always bombshell this, bombshell that, global exclusive this, global exclusive that.
[00:31:36.818 --> 00:31:38.238]  I don't want to be the global exclusive.
[00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:44.725]  I've actually sent this to the main talk show host of the country, all of them.
[00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:46.928]  I guess one of them's dead now, can't do that.
[00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:48.831]  But I've sent it to the other two guys.
[00:31:50.553 --> 00:31:51.415]  And they're sending me stuff.
[00:31:51.435 --> 00:31:52.837]  They're like, I'm busy, you cover it.
[00:31:53.497 --> 00:31:54.178]  And I get it.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.122]  This is unbelievable.
[00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:08.893]  What this says, this is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they fund the main group, admitting that mRNA will actually destroy your immunity and open you up for any other virus or bacteria to kill your ass.
[00:32:09.233 --> 00:32:13.995]  And that once your immunity is removed, they're going to have to basically give you weekly shots for whatever else is there.
[00:32:14.255 --> 00:32:17.076]  So this is the ultimate takeover of your body and it's deadly dangerous.
[00:32:17.397 --> 00:32:19.297]  This is the ultimate corporate takeover.
[00:32:19.597 --> 00:32:21.958]  Corporations don't just take over other companies or countries.
[00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:25.780]  You've heard of corporations backing coups, you know, United Fruit and Guatemala.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.702]  This is the corporate takeover of your body.
[00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:38.930]  And if I went through all the sticky notes and all the highlighted stuff, it would take us to read this 10 hours, 5 hours, I don't know.
[00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:40.672]  It would take a long time on there to read this.
[00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.934]  If I just read the highlighted parts, it would take about an hour.
[00:32:44.454 --> 00:32:47.497]  And so I'm just telling you that I'm swimming in the criminals admitting this.
[00:32:47.517 --> 00:32:48.919]  And you're like, well, why do they admit it?
[00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:57.107]  Because they put it in a corporate plan, and then if it ever came out, FBI, everybody else is like, well, you're the scientist, do what you want, and it's all just admitted here.
[00:32:57.868 --> 00:33:01.592]  So they put it into process and they had all these government officials and the U.S.
[00:33:01.632 --> 00:33:03.994]  government sign on to the Crimson Contagion Plan.
[00:33:04.995 --> 00:33:10.640]  And then they had him sign on to these other plans that are part of this in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.622]  And that's basically what Gates does.
[00:33:13.022 --> 00:33:14.924]  And that's what Jeffrey Epstein working for Gates did.
[00:33:14.944 --> 00:33:16.165]  They were like, do you want money?
[00:33:16.205 --> 00:33:16.825]  Do you want women?
[00:33:16.845 --> 00:33:17.586]  Do you want kids?
[00:33:18.367 --> 00:33:19.868]  We will get it to you.
[00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:25.553]  But if you look at Crimson Contagion, one of the other really huge things in Crimson Contagion,
[00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:44.092]  Is this report out of the Center for Strategic International Studies, that's above the CFR, Strengthening America's Health Security, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and it says in here that they're going to get rid of your immune system with these, quote, gene therapies.
[00:33:44.112 --> 00:33:45.173]  They don't even call them vaccines.
[00:33:45.693 --> 00:33:48.616]  This is three years ago, two years ago, two and a half years ago.
[00:33:49.476 --> 00:33:54.521]  So it's all right here, and anybody can go read this for yourself, okay?
[00:33:56.178 --> 00:33:57.539]  And look, we already knew all this.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.783]  I mean, I've got an article right here.
[00:34:02.803 --> 00:34:16.434]  I mean, even NPR and the New York Times go, well, there's concerns these mRNA vaccines are going to make your body attack itself because they suppress a protein that suppresses cancer.
[00:34:17.314 --> 00:34:23.819]  I mean, it's in here two years, three years ago, and then it's in the news this week.
[00:34:24.761 --> 00:34:27.603]  So what's crazy is the fine print's like, hey, this might give you cancer.
[00:34:27.623 --> 00:34:28.063]  You need it.
[00:34:28.123 --> 00:34:28.964]  It's safe and effective.
[00:34:29.184 --> 00:34:30.305]  President Trump just said so.
[00:34:31.525 --> 00:34:37.009]  President Trump just told you it's safe and effective, just like Boris Johnson, just like Joe Biden.
[00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.531]  And I'm just sitting here going, OK, well, why not?
[00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:41.432]  He already see it.
[00:34:41.452 --> 00:34:41.992]  That's what I said.
[00:34:42.352 --> 00:34:43.493]  He already signed on to it.
[00:34:43.993 --> 00:34:45.995]  So now he's not going to say I got conned.
[00:34:46.055 --> 00:34:46.975]  I got manipulated.
[00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:47.896]  I was wrong.
[00:34:48.156 --> 00:34:49.837]  No, now that like 16 percent of the U.S.
[00:34:49.877 --> 00:34:50.537]  is vaccinated.
[00:34:50.938 --> 00:34:51.618]  I checked this morning.
[00:34:51.638 --> 00:34:52.319]  It may be higher now.
[00:34:52.939 --> 00:34:53.359]  It's over.
[00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:54.160]  Trump's compromised.
[00:34:55.942 --> 00:34:58.803]  It's as if a gun is to the establishment's head.
[00:35:00.124 --> 00:35:03.385]  Everything they're doing is destroying their own future, their children's own future.
[00:35:04.486 --> 00:35:10.608]  But still, in lockstep, they march themselves and all of us towards extinction.
[00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:18.011]  Every metric, every graph, every gauge shows total sterilization by the year 2020.
[00:35:18.071 --> 00:35:18.532]  By the year 2045.
[00:35:26.434 --> 00:35:29.635]  Total sterilization by 2045.
[00:35:30.635 --> 00:35:34.075]  Bloomberg reporting on that a week ago.
[00:35:34.695 --> 00:35:36.416]  Politico reporting on it two weeks ago.
[00:35:36.436 --> 00:35:38.956]  The New York Times reporting on it three weeks ago.
[00:35:39.936 --> 00:35:44.797]  And actually saying in many of the articles, like Politico, this is a good thing.
[00:35:49.738 --> 00:35:51.938]  Because it'll end humanity who is a scourge.
[00:35:52.499 --> 00:35:54.579]  And yes, the chemicals in the food and water are doing it.
[00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:58.126]  And I've talked to top chemists, I've talked to top scientists on air.
[00:35:58.506 --> 00:36:10.755]  They could easily pick other chemicals and other things that are already in the supply chain to do this, but they pick the bad ones on purpose sometimes that are more expensive and don't work as well to do it to all of us.
[00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:16.480]  Because they work for an entity that's come here to destroy the human race.
[00:36:18.021 --> 00:36:19.042]  That's what the Bible says.
[00:36:21.243 --> 00:36:26.287]  And so there are servants of Satan, and there are servants of the Living God that built this planet and gave us life.
[00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:30.750]  Next hour, I'm going to expose the next level of the enemy operation.
[00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:33.712]  We were amongst the first to expose Agenda 20... 21.
[00:36:35.233 --> 00:36:42.499]  And now we're exposing Agenda... 2030.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.023]  But what comes after Agenda 2030?
[00:36:51.274 --> 00:36:55.296]  For the first time ever, you're going to hear next hour about Agenda 2035.
[00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:06.461]  If they have their way, there will be no humans, as we are known today, left on Earth in 14 years.
[00:37:10.983 --> 00:37:12.484]  Now, in the past, you'd hear me say that.
[00:37:13.675 --> 00:37:14.516]  And you couldn't handle it.
[00:37:14.896 --> 00:37:15.977]  And I knew this was coming then.
[00:37:16.517 --> 00:37:18.959]  And I said it's a global extermination program and I laid out how they would do it.
[00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:22.722]  With successive plagues, successive lockdowns, each one more intense than the last.
[00:37:24.023 --> 00:37:25.704]  Bathing you in electromagnetic radiation.
[00:37:26.465 --> 00:37:33.470]  Mutagenically manipulating your DNA so that they can extract cures to cancer and other diseases for themselves.
[00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.151]  Breakaway civilizations.
[00:37:35.612 --> 00:37:38.114]  The end of the nation state, the rise of the city state.
[00:37:39.054 --> 00:37:40.415]  The ten regional governors.
[00:37:40.656 --> 00:37:42.357]  All of it has been laid out.
[00:37:44.355 --> 00:37:48.197]  And Donald Trump is not an idiot.
[00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:53.840]  And he was anti-vax because his son got hurt by it.
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.701]  He got convinced to go along with it to reopen the economy.
[00:37:56.741 --> 00:38:00.443]  He said, well, if you're old, you can take it, I guess, if you want.
[00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:02.625]  When it's actually old people that get killed by the vaccine.
[00:38:02.645 --> 00:38:03.205]  But he didn't know that.
[00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:04.966]  He was listening to the liars around him.
[00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:07.395]  But I'm not an apologist for Trump.
[00:38:07.956 --> 00:38:09.436]  I'm going off what he said and what he did.
[00:38:09.576 --> 00:38:13.338]  Because he did some good things and had the same enemies as me, I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
[00:38:13.718 --> 00:38:32.105]  But now with all the hindsight and all the things that have happened, and all the things that have gone on, and all the 25 countries in Europe banning a bunch of the vaccines, and the Pfizer vaccine being banned in India and other countries, and Trump's up there saying, oh, it's safe, you should all take it.
[00:38:32.881 --> 00:38:38.567]  And now they're doing testing on newborn babies who aren't even, quote, able to get sick from COVID, if you even believe in that.
[00:38:39.488 --> 00:38:40.869]  It's so evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:41.209 --> 00:38:48.176]  This is the equivalent of child sacrifice, that every culture in its decline, in its collapse, would demand that we kill our children.
[00:38:48.476 --> 00:38:50.158]  What is the force driving this?
[00:38:50.418 --> 00:38:52.120]  Why does it always come back to this?
[00:38:54.903 --> 00:38:55.744]  The latest headline.
[00:38:57.236 --> 00:39:02.717]  Transgender activist makes argument for all children to be put on puberty blockers until they can determine their identity.
[00:39:05.478 --> 00:39:06.338]  Total child abuse.
[00:39:07.018 --> 00:39:09.239]  Total mutilation of children.
[00:39:09.259 --> 00:39:17.440]  It's okay if we get a little boy to convince himself, even though he's not of age to make decisions, to chop his genitals off, but if you have sex with him, you go to prison.
[00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:22.221]  That's how sick all of this evil has gotten.
[00:39:23.442 --> 00:39:24.282]  Before I play Trump,
[00:39:25.964 --> 00:39:34.955]  And when he said on Fox, let's go ahead and go to just one of dozens of clips of each one of them.
[00:39:36.357 --> 00:39:42.324]  Beto, the puppet O'Rourke and AOC, Ms.
[00:39:42.364 --> 00:39:42.925]  Cortez.
[00:39:44.707 --> 00:39:49.810]  Telling us how we're to be conquered via the global meltdown, the global collapse of the economy, starvation.
[00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.811]  And how is that?
[00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:53.432]  Oh, it wasn't a snowstorm that did it.
[00:39:53.452 --> 00:39:56.174]  It wasn't a typhoon that did it or a hurricane.
[00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:57.535]  It wasn't earthquakes or volcanoes.
[00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:18.634]  It was them artificially turning the power off and artificially turning the food off and the jobs off for a year in the third world, causing tens of millions more people to starve to death and then collapse and flood us, which the UN then uses to have political control of new groups that are under their domestication inside what's left of the West.
[00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:20.716]  The UN uses migrant hordes.
[00:40:21.806 --> 00:40:39.197]  And they use economic warfare, and they use viral warfare, and they use economic warfare to shut everything down in the name of COVID, but it's the shutdown that actually causes the death, the suicide, the collapse, and then all the insurance companies don't have to pay their doctors or their nurses or you for your medical procedures for a year.
[00:40:39.477 --> 00:40:43.020]  They save trillions of dollars and train you to sit there and take it.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:49.164]  To be austere when they've stolen hundreds of trillions of dollars from you.
[00:40:50.202 --> 00:40:57.867]  And to make it sexy for you to be poor while they fly around in their jumbo jets and move to their armored redoubts.
[00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:17.219]  And so just as I told you 16 years ago that top Hollywood director James Cameron had evacuated to his fleet, that's his backup, and to New Zealand because of the coming worldwide collapse, they're going to call it a collapse of the environment when the borders are open, when they turn the food off.
[00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.244]  When they destroy world currencies.
[00:41:21.505 --> 00:41:23.686]  It's all climate change because the borders are open.
[00:41:23.866 --> 00:41:25.507]  It's all climate change, people are starving.
[00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:30.250]  It's all climate change that deadly viruses, you know, are being released and they're preparing to release them.
[00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.952]  They tell you the collapse is coming, then it comes.
[00:41:34.252 --> 00:41:36.534]  Oh, the collapse is coming because I was bad.
[00:41:36.554 --> 00:41:38.355]  I didn't sacrifice enough of my children.
[00:41:39.653 --> 00:41:47.801]  The ancient Babylonians, the ancient Egyptians, the ancient Aztecs, the ancient Druids, all would say, you've got to give us your firstborn child to have their heart cut out.
[00:41:48.101 --> 00:41:48.962]  There's too many people.
[00:41:49.002 --> 00:41:49.903]  There's not enough crops.
[00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:53.186]  You've got to give your child over to sacrifice the priesthood.
[00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:59.112]  And if you give your son or daughter over to be sacrificed, then the priest class knew they were in control of you.
[00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:03.437]  And the truth is, before they'd sacrifice your son or daughter, they'd torture them and rape them.
[00:42:04.468 --> 00:42:09.753]  And it's just psychopaths learn how we work, learn how we operate and create the same system over and over again.
[00:42:09.773 --> 00:42:20.483]  And they've got their wonderland of New Zealand that if there's one COVID case, they lock it all down because when they release the bio weapons to kill everybody, they're going to keep us all locked down and they're all going to be in New Zealand.
[00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:26.909]  What a bunch of selfish, sick freaks.
[00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:27.850]  So here's.
[00:42:28.968 --> 00:42:30.449]  There's his helicopter.
[00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:33.991]  Yeah, he flies around, does whatever he wants, but you don't get to.
[00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:35.211]  You will die.
[00:42:35.231 --> 00:42:36.792]  You're not of the elect.
[00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:40.034]  He makes movies teaching you're bad, you're evil, you're horrible.
[00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:42.855]  You have things, you know, they shouldn't have things.
[00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:45.777]  The general public shouldn't have things, but he's got everything.
[00:42:46.872 --> 00:42:49.955]  And he makes the movie Avatar, teaching you that you're scum and need to die.
[00:42:50.495 --> 00:42:54.879]  Here's AOC and Beto telling you about the end of the world.
[00:42:55.099 --> 00:42:58.141]  But when he says end of the world, they said this two years ago, because that's 2030.
[00:42:58.962 --> 00:43:07.409]  That's the beginning of the end of the world for you and I. The beginning of the new world for them and the elect new group and life extension and all the offshore, off world.
[00:43:07.709 --> 00:43:09.451]  They're going to be gods, they've been told.
[00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:10.192]  Don't you know?
[00:43:10.792 --> 00:43:12.694]  They ate of the fruit.
[00:43:13.976 --> 00:43:15.177]  And they're going to be gods!
[00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:19.861]  They're of the hallucination now of Satan, but first you've got to die because everybody can't have this!
[00:43:21.582 --> 00:43:23.824]  Give us your children and then you will get everything.
[00:43:24.264 --> 00:43:25.825]  Kill your future in your humanity.
[00:43:26.886 --> 00:43:32.450]  Here are some of the minions of the high priest telling you about the end of your world so you accept it.
[00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:38.375]  So they are sages, so they are gods, so they are prophets, even though they're the author of your death.
[00:43:39.687 --> 00:43:41.610]  So I called somebody up and said, you're gonna die tomorrow.
[00:43:41.831 --> 00:43:43.474]  Then I came to their house and stabbed him to death.
[00:43:43.634 --> 00:43:44.796]  Would they say, oh, you're a prophet?
[00:43:44.916 --> 00:43:45.116]  No.
[00:43:46.078 --> 00:43:47.461]  I made it become fulfilled.
[00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:48.122]  Here they are.
[00:43:51.348 --> 00:43:54.892]  There will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today.
[00:43:55.273 --> 00:43:59.858]  There is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils.
[00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:09.570]  There's going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now.
[00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.072]  This is our final chance.
[00:44:12.372 --> 00:44:15.254]  The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this.
[00:44:15.654 --> 00:44:21.558]  That we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
[00:44:21.718 --> 00:44:24.760]  The crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:29.083]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that
[00:44:30.183 --> 00:44:44.309]  Millennials and people and you know Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is
[00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:50.529]  Your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[00:44:50.969 --> 00:44:53.350]  And, like, this is the war.
[00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.810]  This is our World War II.
[00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.551]  And it's a war against humanity.
[00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:57.891]  It's a war of depopulation.
[00:44:57.951 --> 00:44:58.931]  It's a war against carbon.
[00:44:58.951 --> 00:44:59.831]  It's a war against humans.
[00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:04.212]  Like Bill Gates said famously, our war is against carbon, and that's humans.
[00:45:04.512 --> 00:45:05.513]  Everybody at TED Talk laughs.
[00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:06.433]  He says, we're going to kill everybody.
[00:45:06.953 --> 00:45:08.193]  But see, they're all part of the club.
[00:45:08.233 --> 00:45:09.534]  They think they're all going to New Zealand.
[00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:12.094]  Let me tell you, none of you are going to New Zealand.
[00:45:12.554 --> 00:45:13.555]  You're going to go with us.
[00:45:13.595 --> 00:45:14.335]  You understand that?
[00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.911]  Because I've sent out the transmission and others are as well.
[00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:20.651]  You'll never escape what you've done.
[00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:21.612]  You will pay.
[00:45:21.632 --> 00:45:29.914]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that is really, really an awful situation.
[00:45:30.234 --> 00:45:32.435]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:45:32.475 --> 00:45:33.835]  We love the American people.
[00:45:45.049 --> 00:45:47.210]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.731]  We love the American people.
[00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:51.873]  We love the American people.
[00:45:52.174 --> 00:45:53.494]  We love the American people.
[00:45:53.514 --> 00:46:08.404]  They came in peace.
[00:46:08.424 --> 00:46:10.625]  We are not the enemy of the American people.
[00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:12.046]  We love the American people.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.023]  This is CNN.
[00:46:21.103 --> 00:46:28.977]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:36.032]  Aroha, amigos!
[00:46:36.192 --> 00:46:38.854]  It's me, Fentanyl the Dragon.
[00:46:39.334 --> 00:46:45.418]  I am named after the product that my bosses, CCP, bring into your country.
[00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:56.085]  We will talk about Fentanyl in a moment, but first, the COVID hoax that I launched with your Bill Gates, and of course, Klaus Schwab on you, a year ago.
[00:46:56.546 --> 00:46:58.207]  And now you see what happens.
[00:46:58.487 --> 00:47:03.030]  You are in fear to leave your home, and marvelous Marvin Hagler took charity.
[00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:07.072]  Ah, just like your Hank Aaron.
[00:47:07.372 --> 00:47:10.073]  He said take the shot to protect other people.
[00:47:10.393 --> 00:47:13.594]  But now it's admitted it does not protect you from COVID.
[00:47:13.954 --> 00:47:16.555]  And Fauci good, Fauci good.
[00:47:16.935 --> 00:47:19.736]  He says you still can't go out and have the vaccine.
[00:47:20.016 --> 00:47:22.877]  You must social distance and stay close.
[00:47:22.957 --> 00:47:24.617]  And Canada say the same thing.
[00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:26.938]  You say it, UK.
[00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:29.519]  Australia, because I design plan.
[00:47:31.219 --> 00:47:39.621]  That sounds for stupid Americans!
[00:47:40.062 --> 00:47:47.604]  You collapse, while China stay open, make more billionaires and the whole world go bye!
[00:47:47.624 --> 00:47:48.924]  We control your government!
[00:47:48.964 --> 00:47:50.504]  We are collapsing your nation!
[00:47:50.765 --> 00:47:52.485]  Nothing can stand against us!
[00:47:52.745 --> 00:47:54.846]  And your people take our shots and die!
[00:47:54.866 --> 00:47:56.326]  Die Americans!
[00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:57.366]  Die!
[00:47:57.606 --> 00:47:59.007]  CCP will rule you!
[00:48:04.402 --> 00:48:09.364]  And now that Biden has been on coal less than two months, he banned your border patrol.
[00:48:09.684 --> 00:48:19.449]  So the deadly poison fentanyl, with one grain that can kill you, is pouring in at 360% levels above crop.
[00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:22.851]  Your tent cities are spreading, too.
[00:48:23.231 --> 00:48:29.454]  And now your pregnant women fly combat missions, and I will have sex chains for your little boy.
[00:48:30.726 --> 00:48:38.451]  Now finally this evening, it is important to agree with Brian Stelter that no one is allowed to have free speech like Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:40.793]  He should be taken off the airwaves.
[00:48:41.193 --> 00:48:47.258]  And the Grammys, they do not need to wear masks while they teach you to throw Marloff cocktails at police.
[00:48:47.678 --> 00:48:47.958]  No.
[00:48:48.518 --> 00:48:59.066]  And you need to also understand that Swiss officials blame not taking vaccines for COVID even though it admits that vaccines are causing mutations and spreading COVID.
[00:49:00.728 --> 00:49:03.230]  Good American, shut your mouth.
[00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.731]  Take your shot and die.
[00:49:06.212 --> 00:49:08.473]  Cut your son's genitals off.
[00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:11.355]  Tell your little girl, they're a boy.
[00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:14.177]  China run you now, roll over and die.
[00:49:14.497 --> 00:49:16.639]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hello hi.
[00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:18.960]  We run your people, we run you too.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.922]  So do what we say, and we're gonna kill you too.
[00:49:22.242 --> 00:49:24.484]  I tell you again, I'll say it last time.
[00:49:24.964 --> 00:49:27.046]  Info wars is not good.
[00:49:27.426 --> 00:49:29.687]  Bad info wars, bad info wars.
[00:49:31.028 --> 00:49:32.469]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:49:32.609 --> 00:49:35.091]  I don't even know what this is.
[00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:36.432]  How did he get here?
[00:49:37.813 --> 00:49:39.894]  I just caught you, American.
[00:49:40.214 --> 00:49:42.276]  You visited Bandar Video.
[00:49:43.196 --> 00:49:46.439]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[00:49:46.979 --> 00:49:52.983]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you.
[00:49:57.563 --> 00:50:02.765]  It's live at Band.Video.
[00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:08.046]  Another great piece of work by Rob Dew and well I guess I was involved with Darren McBreen.
[00:50:08.066 --> 00:50:09.947]  Darren McBreen, the voice of the dragon.
[00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:11.227]  Darren McBreen, no it's actually me.
[00:50:11.667 --> 00:50:12.648]  Yes, it's satire.
[00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:14.488]  Fentanyl the dragon isn't a real character.
[00:50:15.008 --> 00:50:17.349]  But what I cover in 60 seconds is real.
[00:50:17.709 --> 00:50:19.170]  Everything Fentanyl said is true.
[00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.850]  We'll be back.
[00:50:20.816 --> 00:50:22.296]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:22.316 --> 00:50:27.197]  We are now into our number two, and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:50:27.697 --> 00:50:28.677]  I'm very honored to be here.
[00:50:28.777 --> 00:50:30.478]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:31.618 --> 00:50:49.301]  All right, I've got some major criticisms of the 45th President of the United States, who is the current president, who did win the election in a landslide, who did valiantly stand up to fraud until they were able to hijack our event at the Capitol and then threaten him with the 25th Amendment so that he did leave.
[00:50:50.345 --> 00:50:53.626]  All that I understand, I am not a Monday morning quarterback.
[00:50:55.406 --> 00:50:57.567]  And I did never endorse the vaccines.
[00:50:57.927 --> 00:50:59.168]  I never supported taking them.
[00:50:59.248 --> 00:51:00.128]  I never said take them.
[00:51:00.188 --> 00:51:08.410]  I'm one of the biggest critics out there because of the Trojan horses, the additives, the contaminants, the long history of secret experimentation.
[00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:14.952]  But I did play devil's advocate when I would say, well, Trump thinks they're trying to keep the economy closed for years.
[00:51:16.112 --> 00:51:17.953]  They said it'll be two, three years to a vaccine.
[00:51:19.389 --> 00:51:21.029]  I said, they've already got the vaccine ready.
[00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:26.511]  They have already done COVID testing under other names in ducks, in chickens, in pigs, in cows.
[00:51:27.191 --> 00:51:34.612]  We showed you all that a year ago on air and had biological weapons experts like Dr. Boyle, who's on next hour, and others on to break it down.
[00:51:35.532 --> 00:51:40.434]  So I said, clearly what they've done is they've gone to Trump and said, oh, we can't ever reopen.
[00:51:41.914 --> 00:51:43.754]  Well, Trump only cares about the economy in general.
[00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:45.195]  He thought this was a classic vaccine.
[00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:46.295]  And we know what happened.
[00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:46.835]  This has come out.
[00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.892]  He said, they said, yes, sir, you know, we'll have to go through animal testing and we'll have to go through human testing.
[00:51:52.912 --> 00:51:55.693]  It'll take two to three years and we can never reopen.
[00:51:55.893 --> 00:51:56.893]  He said, well, you can't do that.
[00:51:56.953 --> 00:52:05.676]  He said, Operation Warp Speed, which they already had planned in their war games in Crimson Contagion and Operation Lockstep and Event 201.
[00:52:07.847 --> 00:52:09.087]  And so they came to him with a script.
[00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:12.649]  He saw all the media, all the shows, said we can never reopen.
[00:52:12.669 --> 00:52:14.849]  He saw the apocalyptic stage scenes in China.
[00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.690]  And he said, okay.
[00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.911]  Warp speed, but if you're, you know, young, you don't need it.
[00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:21.151]  You shouldn't be made to take it.
[00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.772]  And so I'm like, well, Trump is lesser of two evils.
[00:52:24.812 --> 00:52:27.233]  I don't agree with it, but he's doing this to get things going.
[00:52:27.273 --> 00:52:28.253]  I think he's being set up.
[00:52:30.094 --> 00:52:32.255]  But I said, I understand from his perspective why he's doing it.
[00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:32.635]  I don't agree.
[00:52:34.073 --> 00:52:40.640]  Well, now we've seen 25 countries ban the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is a virus vector vaccine, super dangerous as well.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.424]  It's kind of the same as mRNA, but it jams it right into the DNA with a virus that goes in.
[00:52:46.606 --> 00:52:50.149]  The other one programs the ribosomes on the outside to go in and program, but it's all the same crap.
[00:52:50.169 --> 00:52:50.770]  It's very dangerous.
[00:52:51.971 --> 00:52:53.593]  And shuts down your immune system so much more.
[00:52:53.613 --> 00:52:54.634]  And I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:52:56.069 --> 00:53:05.794]  But now with all the deaths of Hank Aaron, and marvelous Marvin Hagler, and countless others, and Ben Stein almost dying, and I saw the numbers, it's in the printer, I forgot to get it.
[00:53:05.814 --> 00:53:12.196]  They're having double the side effects in deaths with the Moderna and the Pfizer mRNA than they are with the AstraZeneca.
[00:53:12.377 --> 00:53:14.938]  But they're making it all about AstraZeneca as the distraction.
[00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:17.339]  Oh, it was the AstraZeneca that caused the problems.
[00:53:18.786 --> 00:53:19.966]  And believe me, it's got its problems.
[00:53:20.006 --> 00:53:24.227]  It, like, shoots some chimpanzee virus into you with another virus.
[00:53:24.287 --> 00:53:25.548]  I mean, this is dangerous stuff.
[00:53:25.688 --> 00:53:26.328]  Into your cells.
[00:53:27.848 --> 00:53:35.770]  This isn't like a normal vaccine, folks, where you'll feel like they put a dead bacteria or a dead virus in and your body learns how to kill it and learns it's an outsider.
[00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.711]  That's got its own side effects, but it works sometimes.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.701]  You know, they cook it up on dead babies.
[00:53:43.101 --> 00:53:45.242]  If the baby had cancer viruses, well, you get cancer.
[00:53:45.282 --> 00:53:49.183]  Or they cook it up on peanuts, you now get a peanut allergy and die if you get around peanuts.
[00:53:49.223 --> 00:53:51.084]  I mean, there's a lot of problems with the old one.
[00:53:51.304 --> 00:53:58.086]  They tried to cover it up, but now they're like, oh, Trump says it's safe and effective, and so does the British Prime Minister.
[00:53:58.346 --> 00:53:59.027]  But it's not.
[00:53:59.107 --> 00:54:03.868]  I have a stack of articles where they say, well, the side effects are outweighed by the benefits.
[00:54:03.888 --> 00:54:05.149]  Well, I thought there's no side effects.
[00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:08.090]  So it's lie within lie within lie.
[00:54:09.437 --> 00:54:25.130]  And so now, Trump going on Fox this morning, we're gonna play the clip, I guess he went on last night too, so we got two clips, and endorsing on Fox and Fox Business that you should take it and it's fine and it's great is a damn lie.
[00:54:25.811 --> 00:54:38.261]  I've got the mainline article submitting doesn't protect you from COVID, causes COVID mutations in the cells and your cells to create new real deadly viruses, can shut off your immune system, can cause an autoimmune response.
[00:54:40.339 --> 00:54:41.019]  It's incredible.
[00:54:41.339 --> 00:54:45.081]  This is not regular vaccines that they invented 500 years ago in Europe.
[00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:47.162]  This is genetic re-engineering.
[00:54:49.663 --> 00:54:53.365]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:54:54.205 --> 00:54:58.507]  And so Trump coming out and doing this, for me, is him crossing the Rubicon.
[00:54:59.127 --> 00:54:59.908]  Because this is 2021.
[00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:03.249]  And there's major pushback against this.
[00:55:03.289 --> 00:55:04.290]  But see, I predicted this.
[00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:05.110]  It wasn't hard to predict.
[00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:06.011]  It's how they work.
[00:55:07.491 --> 00:55:08.592]  They say it's not a baby.
[00:55:09.898 --> 00:55:10.619]  It's not a human.
[00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:12.240]  Roe v. Wade, 1973.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.261]  Tens of millions of women get an abortion.
[00:55:14.301 --> 00:55:16.623]  Now they're going to defend it because they never want to admit they killed their baby.
[00:55:16.803 --> 00:55:17.523]  They never want to admit it.
[00:55:17.743 --> 00:55:22.527]  Doubles their chances of uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, or more.
[00:55:22.847 --> 00:55:23.988]  More than double in some of the studies.
[00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:28.170]  They just know it's good because they commit the crime against God.
[00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.412]  Instead of repenting, you harden your heart.
[00:55:30.512 --> 00:55:31.272]  You double down.
[00:55:32.423 --> 00:55:36.824]  You don't get God to forgive you, and now you're a servant of evil, and now you're going to support euthanizing old people.
[00:55:36.984 --> 00:55:38.825]  Now you're going to support keeping babies alive and selling their organs.
[00:55:39.025 --> 00:55:43.226]  Because once you're on that track, you never... Look, folks, I'm not a hypocrite.
[00:55:43.246 --> 00:55:48.667]  I let families say, why in God's name would you admit you paid for abortions?
[00:55:49.328 --> 00:55:50.108]  That's horrible.
[00:55:51.135 --> 00:55:59.423]  Because I did it, and I repented, and I swore to God when I was like 17 years old and re-found God that I would not do that again.
[00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:01.945]  And I went years without even dating.
[00:56:02.365 --> 00:56:04.187]  Because, man, I could look at a woman and get them pregnant back then.
[00:56:04.207 --> 00:56:04.847]  I'm still fertile.
[00:56:05.668 --> 00:56:09.672]  And then I started dating a girl, got her pregnant, married her, had three children with her.
[00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.231]  And that's the way, you know, I will never do that again.
[00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:13.951]  And I repented.
[00:56:14.011 --> 00:56:15.172]  I had that God forgave me.
[00:56:15.192 --> 00:56:19.053]  And I, it's like King David did all these horrible things, but he didn't mean it.
[00:56:19.593 --> 00:56:20.273]  His heart was real.
[00:56:20.313 --> 00:56:20.974]  God judged his heart.
[00:56:20.994 --> 00:56:21.534]  He was forgiven.
[00:56:22.354 --> 00:56:23.074]  And it was so good.
[00:56:23.134 --> 00:56:24.955]  If you had an abortion, repent!
[00:56:27.736 --> 00:56:29.377]  I still have nightmares seeing the children though.
[00:56:29.777 --> 00:56:32.458]  God still shows me the children as they grow up and how beautiful they were.
[00:56:34.445 --> 00:56:35.546]  I had a big nightmare the other night.
[00:56:35.946 --> 00:56:37.346]  I was holding this little baby in my hand.
[00:56:37.386 --> 00:56:38.127]  It was about an inch big.
[00:56:38.147 --> 00:56:38.987]  It was my son.
[00:56:39.447 --> 00:56:40.508]  It was this incredible son.
[00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:43.569]  And this demonic wolf just came and said, you killed your child.
[00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:44.670]  Just ate it right in front of me.
[00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:45.510]  And I couldn't do anything.
[00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.532]  And Satan looked right at me with those red eyes and said, I got your ass.
[00:56:48.892 --> 00:56:52.614]  But you don't because Christ has delivered me and cleansed me of what I did.
[00:56:54.055 --> 00:56:57.636]  And as long as I don't back down now, I will be with Christ forever.
[00:56:57.956 --> 00:56:59.257]  And so Satan get behind me.
[00:56:59.297 --> 00:57:00.758]  I don't listen to a damn thing you say.
[00:57:02.895 --> 00:57:04.596]  That's what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:05.457 --> 00:57:08.780]  And so, Trump has now been involved in the evil.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.902]  He could come out against Fauci, his archenemy.
[00:57:11.102 --> 00:57:12.283]  He could come out against Gates.
[00:57:12.523 --> 00:57:13.544]  He could defeat them now.
[00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:14.945]  He could admit he was conned.
[00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.167]  He could admit he was lied to.
[00:57:16.187 --> 00:57:22.012]  But now, like all the doctors and all the lawyers and all the politicians and all the media people that said, get your vaccine, be a hero.
[00:57:22.532 --> 00:57:25.534]  Now when people get a regular cold virus, they'll have an autoimmune response.
[00:57:25.795 --> 00:57:26.896]  It's going to kill a bunch of them.
[00:57:27.156 --> 00:57:29.618]  And their PCR tests test anything as a COVID virus.
[00:57:29.818 --> 00:57:31.279]  They're going to say it's a new COVID virus.
[00:57:31.519 --> 00:57:32.380]  You watch next year.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.342]  And we're now in the trap with, quote, all the new strains.
[00:57:35.362 --> 00:57:36.183]  It's not new strains.
[00:57:36.463 --> 00:57:38.805]  It's the new strains being cooked up in the people.
[00:57:39.145 --> 00:57:40.206]  All the science shows it.
[00:57:41.707 --> 00:57:44.489]  And then Trump will come out and say, oh, take more vaccines for the new one.
[00:57:44.669 --> 00:57:47.492]  And they'll all be involved in the cover-up together because Trump
[00:57:48.851 --> 00:57:49.917]  Got caught in the bear trap.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.048]  And Trump is now compromised.
[00:57:52.935 --> 00:57:55.355]  And I would expect to see him betray us when they come for the guns.
[00:57:55.736 --> 00:57:58.436]  I would expect to see him betray us when they come to open the borders.
[00:57:58.456 --> 00:58:00.597]  I mean, he's still doing a lot of good stuff, and I hope I'm wrong.
[00:58:01.137 --> 00:58:02.597]  But kissing his ass ain't gonna fix it.
[00:58:02.857 --> 00:58:05.978]  You gotta get ahold of Trump, you gotta get ahold of his family, all of you.
[00:58:06.198 --> 00:58:13.319]  And you gotta say this is wrong, and you need to come out and admit you were conned, and say the vaccine should be investigated, and that you were lied to by Fauci.
[00:58:13.339 --> 00:58:21.041]  But instead, Fauci said last week, we need you to come out and tell your people to take it, and Trump took the damn bait, and this is a disaster.
[00:58:21.261 --> 00:58:22.641]  And I will not lie to the audience.
[00:58:22.921 --> 00:58:23.322]  Here he is.
[00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:33.350]  I would.
[00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.531]  I would recommend it.
[00:58:34.731 --> 00:58:38.752]  And I would recommend it to a lot of people that don't want to get it.
[00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:41.354]  And a lot of those people voted for me, frankly.
[00:58:41.414 --> 00:58:45.955]  But, you know, again, we have our freedoms and we have to live by that.
[00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:47.996]  And I agree with that also.
[00:58:48.456 --> 00:58:50.057]  But it's a great vaccine.
[00:58:50.117 --> 00:58:51.218]  It's a safe vaccine.
[00:58:51.318 --> 00:58:53.359]  And it's something that works.
[00:58:53.439 --> 00:58:56.360]  And we've been working around the clock.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:07.527]  What I got the FDA to do this would have happened this would have happened in many many Years from now if we didn't give He signed on to it.
[00:59:07.967 --> 00:59:09.628]  They gave him a bunch of drugs made him feel great.
[00:59:09.849 --> 00:59:13.011]  He sees a nice doctor thinks well It's no it's a big evil global corporation.
[00:59:13.251 --> 00:59:22.497]  It's the you and it's Bill Gates Bypassing all the trials they tricked you to do it and now now your name signed on to it And so now you're like oh, you know there might be a few problems, but let's move forward.
[00:59:22.777 --> 00:59:25.019]  No he said it's safe It's not safe.
[00:59:25.239 --> 00:59:26.139]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:26.920]  It's a gene therapy
[00:59:28.061 --> 00:59:30.242]  And so Trump has to pull out of this now.
[00:59:30.763 --> 00:59:33.505]  We need to see Trump come out and clarify this very soon or...
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.261]  You know, I'm not going to sit there and go along with it.
[00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:39.303]  I know you're not as well.
[00:59:39.983 --> 00:59:42.185]  We should probably open the phones up and do a whole show on this.
[00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:45.507]  In fact, regardless, we got a big guest coming up next hour.
[00:59:45.527 --> 00:59:47.028]  I've got even more coming up next segment.
[00:59:47.048 --> 00:59:48.969]  Let's look at the current countries banning these.
[00:59:49.289 --> 00:59:55.334]  The deaths, the convulsions, the evil, and the fact they admit it doesn't protect you and breeds deadly virus.
[00:59:55.574 --> 00:59:59.837]  Mainline News admits it creates deadly strains, turns you into COVID-25 factories.
[01:00:01.912 --> 01:00:03.533]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:03.613 --> 01:00:12.957]  Coming up in the next two segments, that key report on the globalist plan for a controlled end of the world in or around the year 2030.
[01:00:13.857 --> 01:00:17.139]  Learn what Agenda 2035 is exclusively.
[01:00:17.159 --> 01:00:19.180]  And I'm as serious as a heart attack.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.140]  People figure that out now.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.661]  People used to hear me say this stuff 25 years ago, it's all come true.
[01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:26.363]  I've studied their documents, all their information, fused it together.
[01:00:27.534 --> 01:00:34.457]  I have a lot of contacts, a lot of sources, but I'm now above basically any of those sources except for a few of the top globalists.
[01:00:34.977 --> 01:00:42.881]  I'm one of the only people outside the top globalist leadership that actually have all the contacts and all the info to see their complete master plan.
[01:00:43.361 --> 01:00:46.843]  And again, I'm not bragging, it's true, and I literally
[01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:49.224]  Cannot tell you more at that point, okay?
[01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:58.651]  But I have briefed world leaders, I have briefed the President, I have briefed the former head of Defense Intelligence, I have briefed former head of National Security, I have briefed all of them and they agree with me.
[01:00:59.131 --> 01:01:01.693]  And that's why seeing Trump go this way is really, really sad.
[01:01:02.193 --> 01:01:05.936]  But you cannot put your faith and trust in man, only put it in God.
[01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:10.499]  I mean, hell, all this CG video coming out with Biden, who even knows if he's even alive right now?
[01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:14.122]  I mean, we are in the Twilight Zone situation right now.
[01:01:15.287 --> 01:01:16.047]  Two big issues.
[01:01:16.147 --> 01:01:17.948]  Today is the last day to get free shipping.
[01:01:18.088 --> 01:01:18.629]  Storewide.
[01:01:18.669 --> 01:01:19.889]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:22.370]  That means on X2, X3, Turbo Force.
[01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:23.831]  All of it.
[01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:24.972]  Down and Out.
[01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:26.212]  Our new liquid formula.
[01:01:26.252 --> 01:01:28.613]  Even stronger than Knockout.
[01:01:28.653 --> 01:01:29.314]  And Knockout's great.
[01:01:29.334 --> 01:01:30.634]  Maybe you don't want something super strong.
[01:01:30.734 --> 01:01:31.375]  Knockout's great.
[01:01:31.835 --> 01:01:33.696]  It's got eight different formulas to make you sleep good.
[01:01:35.143 --> 01:01:41.184]  This is about four times stronger, and it's a different formula, but it's got four times the melatonin just alone in it, okay?
[01:01:41.504 --> 01:01:43.445]  So that's 40% off free shipping.
[01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:45.845]  The Krill Oil is the highest grade out there.
[01:01:45.885 --> 01:01:46.986]  That's 40% off free shipping.
[01:01:47.406 --> 01:01:48.966]  That is going to have to end tomorrow.
[01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.226]  RainForce Plus is back in stock.
[01:01:52.027 --> 01:01:52.867]  The great Nootropic.
[01:01:53.347 --> 01:01:54.827]  It's 50% off free shipping.
[01:01:55.987 --> 01:02:00.628]  That's our new big sale, so that will extend after tomorrow, but the others will be over tomorrow.
[01:02:00.768 --> 01:02:02.269]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:03.089]  And then separately,
[01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:15.092]  You can either pay like $600 for a sat phone and buy your minutes on a card, or you can pay nothing for the sat phone and then buy your minutes each month with a yearly contract.
[01:02:15.512 --> 01:02:16.954]  Both deals are the best deals out there.
[01:02:16.994 --> 01:02:18.036]  We've chosen to go with this one.
[01:02:18.436 --> 01:02:19.297]  Steve Quayle loves it.
[01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:21.171]  And it's a great deal.
[01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.772]  And it's InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:02:23.792 --> 01:02:24.973]  He's just the guy that recommended this.
[01:02:25.053 --> 01:02:29.376]  But when the cell towers go down, all the power failures, satellite phones still work.
[01:02:29.756 --> 01:02:33.339]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everywhere you go and everything you say.
[01:02:33.399 --> 01:02:35.140]  Satellite phones do not have this issue.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.922]  Satellite phones work in extreme remote location.
[01:02:38.402 --> 01:02:40.343]  If you can see the sky, your phone will work.
[01:02:40.684 --> 01:02:42.765]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone.
[01:02:43.085 --> 01:02:45.487]  Only $9.995 per month for 150 minutes per month.
[01:02:45.507 --> 01:02:46.167]  That's a great deal.
[01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:48.329]  No charge for receiving calls.
[01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:48.749]  That's key.
[01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:49.970]  Everybody can call you on the phone.
[01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:53.275]  From other cell phones or landlines to your satellite phone.
[01:02:53.295 --> 01:02:54.317]  So they're calling you.
[01:02:54.577 --> 01:02:55.599]  It's not geolocating.
[01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:56.821]  That's the value right there.
[01:02:58.243 --> 01:03:01.205]  Car antennas and home antennas are also available for satellite phones.
[01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:02.386]  You don't have to be outdoors when you use it.
[01:03:02.426 --> 01:03:04.687]  If not, use it outdoors and it works anywhere in the world.
[01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.108]  Traveling in your vehicle as well.
[01:03:06.468 --> 01:03:09.370]  Stay in touch with loved ones during a national and international emergency.
[01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.912]  Infowarsphone.com.
[01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:16.034]  Infowarsphone.com or order by phone 941-955-1020 and ask for the Alex Jones Special 941-955-1020.
[01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:16.955]  Infowarsphone.com.
[01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:25.519]  And we will stop right there.
[01:03:25.539 --> 01:03:28.481]  I think they've already sold like 3,000 phones they were telling me.
[01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:28.881]  That's great.
[01:03:28.901 --> 01:03:32.723]  Because everybody needs to get those and that funds the operation.
[01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.445]  And I'm doing this because it's a great deal.
[01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:39.087]  We get $5 per phone that's sold to fund the operation.
[01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.009]  Geez, that's not that much money.
[01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:42.810]  Well, it doesn't matter because that's actually a good deal.
[01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:43.350]  That's what we're doing.
[01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:45.872]  We could go with other folks and make $50 a phone.
[01:03:45.892 --> 01:03:47.473]  We're doing that because it's one of the best deals out there.
[01:03:47.793 --> 01:03:49.494]  And they also do some advertising on the website.
[01:03:49.554 --> 01:03:50.495]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:03:50.835 --> 01:03:52.096]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[01:03:53.103 --> 01:03:53.783]  And I've got one.
[01:03:53.823 --> 01:03:54.804]  I need to hook it up and use it.
[01:03:54.824 --> 01:03:56.664]  It's really easy to do, but it's still in the box in my office.
[01:03:56.684 --> 01:03:58.745]  So I'm going to get around to that very soon because it's great.
[01:03:58.805 --> 01:03:59.705]  Everybody can call the number.
[01:04:00.085 --> 01:04:00.825]  It's free for you.
[01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:02.346]  It's the only cost when you call.
[01:04:02.386 --> 01:04:02.766]  Understand?
[01:04:04.727 --> 01:04:07.088]  It's like beyond a blocket pocket or a privacy pocket.
[01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:11.529]  Okay, where should I start this segment ahead of this big report?
[01:04:15.704 --> 01:04:16.205]  Let's do this.
[01:04:16.966 --> 01:04:21.170]  Let's go ahead and just read headlines in the vaccine stack from today.
[01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:22.691]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:04:23.452 --> 01:04:29.819]  The crew found another article I didn't know of, the New York Times, right when they were launching the COVID attack a year and three months ago.
[01:04:30.379 --> 01:04:32.762]  It's the end of humanity and maybe it's for the best.
[01:04:33.823 --> 01:04:36.025]  New York Times says, get rid of humans, they're evil.
[01:04:36.245 --> 01:04:36.946]  That's their religion.
[01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:38.668]  Just remember that when you see this.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.431]  Former State Department lead investigator says COVID-19 escape from Wuhan lab may have been bioweapons accident.
[01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:49.176]  That's what we told you over a year ago with Dr. Boyle joining us next hour.
[01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:50.137]  It's not an accident though.
[01:04:51.294 --> 01:04:56.437]  New York official Tracy Edwards says, take the vaccine and do not question what is in it.
[01:04:57.137 --> 01:04:58.138]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:58.158 --> 01:04:59.018]  We'll play that with Goyle.
[01:04:59.618 --> 01:05:05.541]  Journalist proclaims she would love to die, it's human sacrifice, from the AstraZeneca vaccine if it helps others.
[01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:11.445]  And we found the other two, Moderna and Pfizer mRNAs are twice as bad as AstraZeneca.
[01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:15.807]  They're scapegoating AstraZeneca, I wouldn't take it either, to divert from what they've done.
[01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:22.541]  Half of French health workers now, nurses and doctors, refuse the coronavirus vaccine.
[01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:23.861]  Listen to the doctors, huh?
[01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:28.522]  COVID-19 is just the beginning as Communist China plots new killer viruses.
[01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.703]  Key article on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:31.403 --> 01:05:37.045]  New York City judge removes six-year-old from mother because she didn't wear a mask while dropping her off at school.
[01:05:37.165 --> 01:05:38.785]  The mother didn't do it.
[01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:43.867]  The little girl goes in with the mask, huffing the carbon dioxide, doing whatever she's told.
[01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:48.770]  The mother has her child taken with enjoyment.
[01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.972]  That's your Contact Tracers, coming now.
[01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:53.154]  Clinton Foundation runs it with Bill Gates.
[01:05:53.654 --> 01:05:54.615]  Aw, Bill Gates!
[01:05:54.975 --> 01:06:01.181]  California shut off power to a restaurant for refusing to comply with shutdown, so they are using generators to stay open anyways.
[01:06:02.902 --> 01:06:09.187]  Thousands of small business, tens of thousands told you're not essential, but all the big companies are essential, doubling profits.
[01:06:09.488 --> 01:06:10.729]  That's criminal racketeering.
[01:06:11.894 --> 01:06:16.358]  Young Florida man reaches out for help after his parents were taken away by the FBI.
[01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:18.440]  Now they're going after the family's farm.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.801]  Everyone gangs in.
[01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:23.345]  And it goes into how they're taking people's farm and all the rest of it.
[01:06:23.365 --> 01:06:24.906]  And the antifa targets you.
[01:06:25.326 --> 01:06:29.770]  Brussels prepares to introduce vaccine passports to save European tourism industry.
[01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:30.811]  They cut it off.
[01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:31.432]  They kill it.
[01:06:31.672 --> 01:06:33.634]  Then say you've got to have vaccination to travel.
[01:06:33.814 --> 01:06:35.235]  But then say, actually, is it true?
[01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:36.717]  Just take the tracker system.
[01:06:38.644 --> 01:06:44.911]  Oh yeah, Big Cruise Line announces, P&O Cruises says vaccinated customers will still have to wear a mask and social distance.
[01:06:45.171 --> 01:06:46.272]  And so have all the other globalists.
[01:06:46.312 --> 01:06:47.934]  It's all a scripted plan.
[01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:52.179]  You give up your rights, you get enslaved, you do what they say and they go, guess what slave?
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.141]  I'm altering the deal.
[01:06:54.481 --> 01:06:55.903]  Pray I don't alter it any further.
[01:06:58.394 --> 01:07:02.236]  Family kicked off flight for not forcing four-year-old autistic son to wear mask.
[01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:05.999]  Autistic children won't wear them, so they already brain damaged him with the vaccine.
[01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:07.640]  Now you can't fly.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:08.500]  Aww.
[01:07:10.821 --> 01:07:14.203]  New York City judge removes six-year-old, already mentioned that, from the mommy.
[01:07:15.104 --> 01:07:18.526]  Nabata bill seeks to auto-enroll residents for organ donors.
[01:07:18.746 --> 01:07:21.748]  They're auto-enrolling you in all the death, in all the evil.
[01:07:23.595 --> 01:07:34.584]  Continuing, Swiss officials blame future fourth wave of COVID on non-vaccinated, but they even admitted in NPR it causes your body to be a factory of deadly viruses and causing mass mutations.
[01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:41.470]  The vaccine causes you to create deadly viruses, which they'll then claim are some new thing that global warming caused.
[01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:48.456]  Top vaccine scientist warns that the world should halt all COVID-19 vaccines immediately or uncontrollable monster will be unleashed.
[01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:49.958]  He just repeats what NPR admitted.
[01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:51.239]  Why are they admitting it all?
[01:07:51.579 --> 01:07:54.480]  Because they want to have plausible deniability.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.261]  That's why.
[01:07:55.601 --> 01:08:06.246]  And here's the Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer, again, found three years ago that RNA from viruses is the main cause of cancer, not mutations in DNA.
[01:08:07.326 --> 01:08:11.628]  It's the viruses, and they say that mRNA testing will probably cause massive cancer.
[01:08:11.848 --> 01:08:12.308]  And guess what?
[01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:19.872]  In the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation document right here, from three years ago, 2018, they admit, in crimson contagion drill,
[01:08:20.836 --> 01:08:24.618]  They admit that it'll actually destroy your immunity and create deadly viruses.
[01:08:26.318 --> 01:08:27.999]  But oh, the FBI couldn't get involved.
[01:08:28.019 --> 01:08:29.560]  They're all just coke-head lawyers.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.681]  You know, they're all just little pedos or whatever at the top, I guess.
[01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:34.962]  So they're like, oh, let the scientists do what they want.
[01:08:34.982 --> 01:08:36.403]  Yeah, with Jeffrey Epstein and the rest of it.
[01:08:36.763 --> 01:08:37.063]  All right.
[01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:37.823]  Agenda 35.
[01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:39.584]  You heard about it here first.
[01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:41.645]  The controlled end of the world coming up.
[01:08:42.822 --> 01:08:48.869]  Along this current trajectory, there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today.
[01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:53.835]  There is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils.
[01:08:54.315 --> 01:09:03.546]  There is going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now.
[01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:06.027]  This is our final chance.
[01:09:06.347 --> 01:09:09.227]  The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this.
[01:09:09.627 --> 01:09:15.529]  That we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
[01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:18.730]  The crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:23.051]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that
[01:09:24.139 --> 01:09:48.628]  Millennials and people and you know Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is Your your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it and like this is the war this is our World War two and
[01:09:54.352 --> 01:10:09.738]  The announcement I'm about to make is so huge there's really no way to do it justice and I am very sorry that I have to announce this information to you but it's just the facts and it's the reality we face.
[01:10:11.519 --> 01:10:14.820]  I have studied every angle and basically every aspect known.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:22.603]  I'm sure there's some that are still classified or secret concerning the World Government Project and what it's in game.
[01:10:23.755 --> 01:10:24.335]  Goals are.
[01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:43.663]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are the public constructs of the UN World Government Plan that lay out, in a kind of pop culture, sanitized way, the basic goals of the Planetary Directors.
[01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:49.966]  The Planetary Directors believe that humans are too dangerous and too warlike.
[01:10:51.098 --> 01:10:59.124]  They were tasked by the Carney Endowment around 100 years ago, after World War I, to develop a plan to end war as we know it.
[01:11:00.485 --> 01:11:03.507]  And the decision was made to basically end humanity as we know it.
[01:11:04.367 --> 01:11:08.971]  And if that wasn't done, humanity would inevitably destroy itself.
[01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:20.539]  So that's the basis and the excuse from which the very authoritarian, very selfish, so-called elitist operate from.
[01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:25.822]  And again, there are thousands of facets to all this, but here's the big announcement.
[01:11:26.902 --> 01:11:39.311]  When you hear AOC, and you see people like Beto O'Rourke, with tears in their eyes, say everyone is going to be dead in 11 years.
[01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.433]  They said that in 2019.
[01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:45.235]  And they say it with total conviction.
[01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:53.038]  It's because they have been briefed, but only on part of what is about to transpire and unfold.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:10.090]  With completely straight faces, the major global corporations that control the UN have roundtable meetings on pretty much a continuous basis, managing their underlings with limited compartmentalized information.
[01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:30.081]  And they give them all sorts of different fake data reports about the plankton in the sea dying and the atmosphere of the earth being lost and basically get the management class under them in a very apocalyptic mode that they are these guardians and savers of the earth.
[01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:36.744]  So they've got to do anything and everything they can, no matter how authoritarian, to stabilize the earth.
[01:12:37.864 --> 01:12:40.325]  And they give them false models that carbon dioxide is indeed
[01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:47.094]  I've got to hit a triggering point that again kills all human life on the planet.
[01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:53.196]  Now all of that is a foregone conclusion or a self-fulfilling prophecy and here's where the big announcement.
[01:12:55.076 --> 01:13:11.460]  But the globalists themselves are already undermining civilization and basic infrastructure because they are the technocrats that are basically already in full control of the major energy and food and transportation and medicine financing systems.
[01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:25.871]  So that as they begin to turn off the food supply to the third world and there are lockdowns and wars and other crises that they implement, the public will be told that it's climate change that's causing it all.
[01:13:26.191 --> 01:13:27.292]  And you've seen this.
[01:13:27.812 --> 01:13:31.292]  Borders are wide open, Biden says come north, climate change.
[01:13:33.613 --> 01:13:37.073]  Collapse of the third world, mass starvation, COVID-19 caused it.
[01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.834]  No, the fake lockdown on the fake virus caused it.
[01:13:42.566 --> 01:13:45.347]  And so, again, that's just their go-to.
[01:13:45.808 --> 01:13:53.151]  That it's your fault, humanity, that the volcano blew up, so we better sacrifice the king's daughter to it.
[01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.472]  If you're an example of ancient Hawaii.
[01:13:56.372 --> 01:13:58.213]  Not even ancient, they were still killing people 200 years ago.
[01:13:59.874 --> 01:14:01.875]  Hell, 150 years ago.
[01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:03.435]  And every other culture has done the same thing.
[01:14:03.515 --> 01:14:05.937]  So we're going back to being dumbed down.
[01:14:05.997 --> 01:14:08.958]  We're a very superstitious population, and
[01:14:11.121 --> 01:14:21.423]  We're being taught that everything that happens is because of us, and so that each new calamity that's visited upon us is the fault of ourselves.
[01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:29.525]  But don't worry, there's these global guardians, the new priest class, just the old priest class, that will save us and protect us.
[01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.705]  Oh, new deadly viruses are coming.
[01:14:31.785 --> 01:14:32.606]  It's climate change.
[01:14:33.426 --> 01:14:34.806]  Doesn't matter if it comes out of a lab.
[01:14:36.046 --> 01:14:37.247]  And again, the virus is real.
[01:14:37.307 --> 01:14:38.527]  It can kill old people that haven't had
[01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:39.912]  We're good to go.
[01:15:09.246 --> 01:15:20.330]  But, in their own literature they admit, it then destroys the animal's immune system, where they can no longer defend themselves and have to be given constant inoculations.
[01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:30.775]  And that's in Bill & Melinda Gates documents that are connected to the Crimson Contagion drill that was conducted two years ago.
[01:15:31.655 --> 01:15:33.196]  But, here's the problem.
[01:15:33.256 --> 01:15:36.577]  I can write a 500 page book and not hit one-tenth of the angles here.
[01:15:38.217 --> 01:16:03.195]  The big announcement that everyone needs to be aware of is that undoubtedly when I put all the hundreds of thousands of pieces together in my mind, and I've proven I'm able to extrapolate all their operations out towards their endgame, that they are definitely planning by 2030 to have an extinction level event for humans
[01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.972]  And basically the end of the world as we know it.
[01:16:07.433 --> 01:16:12.358]  Because they fear the cataclysms and the cycles that humans have been through before.
[01:16:12.378 --> 01:16:19.065]  And they clearly have some of the secret histories of that that Plato only alluded to 2,300 years ago.
[01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:27.013]  And so they are playing God and implementing the global collapse and the global crisis
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:45.412]  And the decadence and all the things that are precursors to it, ahead of time, just like they're trying to control the weather, just like they're trying to control our bodies, and play God, also on a mass scale, they are bringing in an artificial apocalypse.
[01:16:47.113 --> 01:16:52.077]  They believe they're just taking the predictive programming of the Bible as they see it.
[01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:53.998]  They see it as predictive programming.
[01:16:55.501 --> 01:17:07.366]  And that they are then taking control of that narrative and manifesting it before it can actually manifest itself organically in the future.
[01:17:08.286 --> 01:17:11.927]  Which, of course, is classic that they're carrying out God's will.
[01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:18.610]  Or some of the illuminated would say, no, Jones, you are actually following our plan that we planned 2,000 years ago.
[01:17:19.733 --> 01:17:46.924]  Regardless, if you want to just leave it open for debate, and I'm not saying God isn't real, Revelation isn't real, what I'm saying is, regardless, we're going in to the most dystopian, brutal, nightmarish system you've ever seen, run by psychologists and psychiatrists, and just some of the most cold-blooded war gamers, and that at the very top of the system,
[01:17:48.146 --> 01:17:53.991]  They had only had less than one tenth to one percent aware of this master plan even five years ago.
[01:17:55.673 --> 01:18:09.485]  Now they're externalizing the hierarchy and externalizing the method and now have hundreds of publications, Politico, Newsweek, Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, NBC News, all saying, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.329]  Thank God we're all going to be sterile by 2045.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.322]  And again, they put these further dates out there so people go, oh, it'll be then.
[01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:21.443]  No, it's not going to be then.
[01:18:21.483 --> 01:18:22.404]  It's going to be sooner than that.
[01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:28.548]  Everything accelerates towards the artificial singularity they're creating.
[01:18:28.628 --> 01:18:32.851]  I would call it an Armageddon singularity or an end-of-the-world singularity.
[01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:39.055]  And so I only say things when I'm serious mode because I really believe them.
[01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:43.439]  When I go out and I engage occasionally in some satire, have some fun, or go on a comedy show.
[01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:45.160]  That's because I'm a human and I like to do that.
[01:18:46.707 --> 01:18:49.909]  And the media likes to always say, oh, see Jones screwed around over here.
[01:18:50.289 --> 01:18:51.730]  He's an actor, he doesn't mean what he's saying.
[01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:54.232]  Well, you can see the things I've covered over the years come true.
[01:18:54.872 --> 01:18:55.893]  And you know what, I'm being serious.
[01:18:56.193 --> 01:18:57.694]  And so they're trying to confuse that issue.
[01:19:00.255 --> 01:19:00.996]  All that's a lie.
[01:19:02.257 --> 01:19:03.558]  All that's them just distracting.
[01:19:04.358 --> 01:19:05.739]  I'm as serious as a heart attack.
[01:19:06.619 --> 01:19:11.983]  When I say that, when you see AOC and Beto, tears in their eyes.
[01:19:14.059 --> 01:19:17.362]  A year and a half, two years ago, saying, the end of the world in 11 years!
[01:19:17.662 --> 01:19:21.506]  First she said 12 years, I guess in 2018, and then she said in 2019.
[01:19:22.867 --> 01:19:29.293]  It's the end of the world and just very, very soon, 11 years.
[01:19:30.654 --> 01:19:31.795]  And Beto said the same thing.
[01:19:32.937 --> 01:19:39.643]  That's because you have these top billionaires and these top globalists telling them all that.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:20:06.184]  I told everybody the story 15-16 years ago about the major Hollywood producer that had just met with James Cameron and James Cameron told him I'm not going to come out with all these hologram movie theaters now because in the future there's not going to be civilization and none of this is going to be around anymore and I'm going to New Zealand to basically prepare for the end of the world
[01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:23.134]  Because I've, again, run into a lot of top scientists and people, and I've been out to their homes, and I remember they were all told this earlier, getting them ready, 15 years ago.
[01:20:23.174 --> 01:20:33.322]  It was about 15 years ago that they went from probably, I don't know, maybe 200 people in the world knowing about this plan, to externalizing it to probably 10,000.
[01:20:33.923 --> 01:20:35.965]  And I'm just being hypothetical.
[01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:43.797]  But at that point, I got contacted by a lot of, quote, liberals that thought I was full of it, that were top scientists.
[01:20:43.817 --> 01:20:48.542]  You know, some of these people had, you know, mansions, helicopters, everything, just off patents they had.
[01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:53.687]  And I would be sitting there at their dinner table with the husband and the wife that were both scientists.
[01:20:54.127 --> 01:21:00.133]  Another case, a man and his, I guess his husband, also a top scientist.
[01:21:01.738 --> 01:21:03.940]  They were just explaining to me that, yeah, you're right.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:04.780]  We were letting on this.
[01:21:05.321 --> 01:21:06.261]  We can't tell you everything.
[01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.343]  In both cases, the people started crying.
[01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:11.325]  And they said, look, you're on the right track.
[01:21:11.345 --> 01:21:18.050]  We can't tell you, but everybody's moving to rural areas or building bunkers, or everybody's going to New Zealand.
[01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.771]  It's got the money.
[01:21:19.371 --> 01:21:21.472]  All the elites have got private jets.
[01:21:23.154 --> 01:21:25.015]  And it's just, it's worse than you think.
[01:21:25.976 --> 01:21:27.357]  And it's coming.
[01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:45.115]  If you remember right around that same time, Dr. Eric Pianca, who was the head of the biology department at UT at the time, and when he wasn't, this was on his own website, dressing up as a Druid priest with his, uh, and calling himself Lucifer,
[01:21:47.642 --> 01:21:55.848]  He was saying that Ebola would soon be airborne with a 99% kill rate, that he was ready for he and his family to die, and he was sad about it, but it was the great thing for the new age to begin.
[01:21:55.868 --> 01:22:06.036]  And when he gave speeches in the UK and in Texas, it was in the newspaper that there were multi-minute long standing ovations with people crying.
[01:22:06.056 --> 01:22:08.357]  He also talked to some of the reporters that were there.
[01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:10.319]  They said it was worse than what we said in the article.
[01:22:10.779 --> 01:22:13.781]  People had tears running down their eyes when he projected red skulls on the wall.
[01:22:14.744 --> 01:22:18.765]  And said, I'm ready to die, my family's ready to die, we're all going to die soon for the Earth.
[01:22:19.565 --> 01:22:22.726]  And then I had one of his former students who then worked in U.S.
[01:22:22.746 --> 01:22:30.908]  biological weapons areas attack me on the internet and send his threatening emails saying, you know, Bianca's too liberal.
[01:22:31.428 --> 01:22:32.349]  By liberal, I mean too nice.
[01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:35.189]  You know, like when you give somebody too big a stake.
[01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:36.150]  So that's a liberal portion.
[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.590]  Not how liberal sense you mean.
[01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:39.410]  Humans are a parasite.
[01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:41.331]  Who can deny all of us must be gotten rid of.
[01:22:42.344 --> 01:22:59.518]  So, I've looked at all this from where they are, who they are, what they're planning, and like I said, the final equation is, I've never been a UFOlogist, I don't get into Little Green Men, I don't cover any of that, I don't get into speculation, okay?
[01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:06.083]  But if you had to sit back as like a top analyst and say, okay,
[01:23:08.223 --> 01:23:09.044]  What does this look like?
[01:23:09.524 --> 01:23:11.505]  Why would you have a religion that's anti-human?
[01:23:11.525 --> 01:23:14.327]  Why would you say you worship AI gods, you're going to merge the machines?
[01:23:15.008 --> 01:23:23.774]  Why would you be infecting the public with poison mRNA and virus vector vaccines that, by the way, are probably even worse now that I look at it.
[01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:26.396]  It's all pick your poison.
[01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:29.018]  Why would they be doing all that?
[01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:32.671]  Like there's a gun to their head, and it's spiritual.
[01:23:33.112 --> 01:23:36.194]  Again, they don't come from distant stars.
[01:23:36.234 --> 01:23:40.437]  They come from right here in dimensions that we're sandwiched into.
[01:23:41.018 --> 01:23:43.260]  That's what all the mathematics and all the scientists now basically know.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.683]  I mean, I don't know any people that are actually atheists.
[01:23:46.863 --> 01:23:50.726]  That was just something in the 60s and 70s to get people away from understanding there's other realms.
[01:23:51.246 --> 01:23:55.910]  And of course, the religion's ridiculous, and the groups are ridiculous, and all the false priesthoods are ridiculous.
[01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:57.431]  I'm not saying that's all real.
[01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:58.932]  That gets in the way of
[01:23:59.893 --> 01:24:06.198]  Uh, interfacing with the fact that we only see in a very limited spectrum of our own dimension, much less the other dimensions.
[01:24:06.298 --> 01:24:10.842]  And these people are channeling something that is anti-human and very, very bad.
[01:24:11.542 --> 01:24:17.787]  And I think really it's a form of Stockholm Syndrome with the globalists, and that they're so scared about what they're involved in that they're just following orders.
[01:24:18.328 --> 01:24:22.951]  Because if you really study globalists, the really high-level top ones, they're not even a lot of them on a power trip.
[01:24:22.971 --> 01:24:23.432]  They're scared.
[01:24:24.602 --> 01:24:27.784]  And like I told you all, I don't take this as a positive.
[01:24:27.824 --> 01:24:29.526]  I don't take it as some laurel.
[01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:31.607]  But these people are very smart.
[01:24:31.647 --> 01:24:33.448]  They tried to recruit me when I was very young.
[01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:37.351]  And they tried to recruit me basically throughout my career.
[01:24:38.552 --> 01:24:41.794]  And they just act very, very sad and very, very upset that I won't join them.
[01:24:41.834 --> 01:24:42.655]  And they say, you're wrong.
[01:24:42.695 --> 01:24:43.135]  You're wrong.
[01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:44.136]  Humans are bad.
[01:24:44.156 --> 01:24:44.957]  We've got to get rid of them.
[01:24:46.257 --> 01:24:47.718]  And I go, well, tell me.
[01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:48.159]  Tell me more.
[01:24:48.179 --> 01:24:52.142]  They go, well, we can't tell you until you prove yourself, until you join us.
[01:24:53.331 --> 01:24:56.812]  And so, folks, this is very real, okay?
[01:24:57.732 --> 01:25:00.573]  And everybody romanticizes U.S.
[01:25:00.613 --> 01:25:03.594]  intelligence or thinks the military is magic and great.
[01:25:04.054 --> 01:25:10.976]  You see the military announcing that they hate gun owners and hate the American people and hate the military and hate the police, and they're going to call and purge the military and police.
[01:25:11.316 --> 01:25:16.037]  That's because there could be a resistance from there, but Biden and the globalists have gotten basically full control at the top.
[01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:19.565]  And so there isn't some secret group up there that's going to save you.
[01:25:20.066 --> 01:25:28.831]  And again, I've had dinner over the years with high-level military brass, former heads of major programs in the Army and Air Force.
[01:25:29.471 --> 01:25:35.155]  I had a two-hour meeting with the head of two U.S.
[01:25:35.175 --> 01:25:35.995]  intelligence agencies.
[01:25:37.356 --> 01:25:41.939]  And he concurred completely with my analysis of all this, just so you know.
[01:25:42.479 --> 01:25:44.781]  And people are really trying to figure out how to go public with all this.
[01:25:44.821 --> 01:25:46.642]  So just understand.
[01:25:47.927 --> 01:25:55.249]  That they're creating the collapse of civilization, the economic, the spiritual, the cultural, and the physical.
[01:25:57.329 --> 01:25:58.850]  Because it's all spiritual at the end of the day.
[01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:02.470]  And again, spiritual just means out of sight, hidden.
[01:26:04.191 --> 01:26:07.212]  And if you could see all the dimensions, you'd be insane.
[01:26:07.232 --> 01:26:08.672]  It's just too much.
[01:26:10.372 --> 01:26:14.053]  So your optic nerve tunes most of it out.
[01:26:15.033 --> 01:26:15.954]  And I'm gonna explain this again.
[01:26:15.994 --> 01:26:16.934]  I've never taken DMT.
[01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:20.650]  I know a lot of people that have and people that have done it in U.S.
[01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:23.472]  government secret labs before anybody even knew about DMT.
[01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:26.354]  And I was told about it a long time ago.
[01:26:27.935 --> 01:26:34.940]  And they have large groups of people that when the veil is removed, they actually communicate with the entities.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.285]  They have up to, the highest level group I've heard is about 45, 50 people having the same hallucination.
[01:26:41.325 --> 01:26:42.686]  Well, it's not the same hallucination.
[01:26:43.746 --> 01:27:02.559]  Either it's all their brains linking up and creating some type of mass imprinted memory or recording that's there or it's actually entities that appear and communicate with you and that they're all experiencing an interdimensional opening or a veil being removed, a portal being opened.
[01:27:02.679 --> 01:27:03.599]  Every culture believed in that.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:10.304]  The reason I say it could be like some type of recording that was basically put in our genes is a lot of the experiences are exactly the same.
[01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:11.925]  They're going to say the same things over and over again.
[01:27:13.305 --> 01:27:20.650]  Now, if you do a lot of really evil stuff and kill a lot of people and spill a lot of blood, then some other stuff happens.
[01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:27.594]  And that's why people see the recordings when they're, quote, wizards, when they're into pharmakeia, when they're witches.
[01:27:28.575 --> 01:27:29.715]  And that was every culture.
[01:27:29.855 --> 01:27:31.477]  The Aztecs, of course, went deep into this.
[01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:37.961]  And so the winged serpent and other entities start demanding more and more blood to get into higher levels.
[01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:39.989]  I think?
[01:27:53.206 --> 01:27:54.627]  is planned for somewhere around 2030.
[01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:58.748]  I told you 2012 was BS, that was just programming you.
[01:27:59.688 --> 01:28:00.989]  You've got to put that into your mind.
[01:28:01.589 --> 01:28:05.210]  And it's not going to be a physical end of the world, it's the end of the world as we know it, the end of the human world.
[01:28:06.091 --> 01:28:08.892]  And the Bible tells us it's going to get out of hand and most of the earth is going to get destroyed.
[01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:12.213]  A large portion of the public is going to be killed.
[01:28:12.893 --> 01:28:15.374]  And then if God didn't intervene, there'd be no flesh spared.
[01:28:16.435 --> 01:28:17.755]  So I love you guys.
[01:28:17.975 --> 01:28:19.156]  I really care about you.
[01:28:19.176 --> 01:28:19.896]  That's the best I can
[01:28:20.993 --> 01:28:22.094]  Lay some of these thoughts out here.
[01:28:22.114 --> 01:28:23.936]  There's a lot of other angles to this, obviously.
[01:28:25.218 --> 01:28:31.465]  But the globalists are planning a controlled demolition of humanity as we know it.
[01:28:31.605 --> 01:28:34.328]  A controlled, limited end of the world.
[01:28:35.225 --> 01:28:36.366]  And they pretty much admit that to you.
[01:28:36.386 --> 01:28:39.029]  I mean, they say at the end of the world's coming if you don't do exactly as they say.
[01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:42.593]  And then, of course, if you don't do exactly what they say, oh, you're causing the end of the world.
[01:28:42.873 --> 01:28:43.994]  But they're always the saviors.
[01:28:44.034 --> 01:28:45.115]  They're the guardians of the earth.
[01:28:45.476 --> 01:28:46.657]  They're the guardians of your genetics.
[01:28:46.677 --> 01:28:47.898]  They're the guardians of goodness.
[01:28:48.379 --> 01:28:50.061]  Oh, they love the black people while they kill them.
[01:28:50.982 --> 01:28:53.064]  It's all completely transparent, but it's spiritual.
[01:28:53.644 --> 01:28:56.507]  You've got to shift your awareness and just...
[01:28:57.388 --> 01:29:01.009]  You only shift it about 30-40 degrees, and you're like, oh my gosh, there's the whole thing.
[01:29:01.029 --> 01:29:01.970]  You've got to look at it at an angle.
[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:04.991]  And then you realize that they actually had you looking at it upside down.
[01:29:05.891 --> 01:29:10.013]  So, once you see it, folks, there's no going back.
[01:29:10.033 --> 01:29:12.894]  Because, I mean, it's like they say in the Matrix, which is an allegory of this.
[01:29:16.615 --> 01:29:18.676]  One cannot be told about the Matrix, one has to see it.
[01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:24.157]  Okay, I hope all of you will share this, because they are planning to control the end of the world.
[01:29:25.118 --> 01:29:32.451]  And the end of the world, as you know, it has already begun, as you see, and I, uh... I just say, God bless, and good luck.
[01:29:33.846 --> 01:29:47.235]  I'm getting to the point where I'm reading 25 countries banning one vaccine, India banning the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer, mass death, people I know have lost loved ones that took it, Hank Aaron, Marvin Hagler dying.
[01:29:47.596 --> 01:29:55.701]  I've got all these mainline articles admitting it doesn't protect you, Fauci admits it doesn't protect you, and then they admit it's going to cause a mutation factory of deadly viruses.
[01:29:57.372 --> 01:30:01.234]  I mean, this is like Armageddon or something is unfolding.
[01:30:01.974 --> 01:30:05.776]  And I don't know what to say or what to do, but here's a report I shot this morning.
[01:30:06.497 --> 01:30:07.617]  It's on Bandot Video.
[01:30:07.758 --> 01:30:11.560]  Agenda 2035, the post-human world, controlled planetary collapse.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:13.701]  And that's what they call it, a post-human world.
[01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.422]  Controlled planetary collapse to, quote, save the Earth.
[01:30:16.822 --> 01:30:19.544]  This is the most fantastical craziness.
[01:30:20.644 --> 01:30:21.645]  What was that, 10,000 views?
[01:30:21.685 --> 01:30:23.226]  My goodness, it just went live five minutes ago.
[01:30:24.284 --> 01:30:26.347]  And we're going to post it on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:27.249 --> 01:30:28.571]  That's just me talking about it.
[01:30:29.773 --> 01:30:32.758]  And all of the admissions of this.
[01:30:32.818 --> 01:30:33.980]  So I'm going to say this.
[01:30:34.521 --> 01:30:36.203]  Nobody's up to this pay grade.
[01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:37.866]  Nobody can handle this.
[01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:40.091]  And I know you can't handle it.
[01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:43.813]  And I almost feel bad saying all this stuff, but let me tell you something.
[01:30:43.853 --> 01:30:54.897]  We had Dr. Francis Boyle on in February, and in March, and in April, and in May, and in June, July, and in August, and September, and in October, and November, and December.
[01:30:55.597 --> 01:31:03.140]  We had him on every month, the last 10 months of the year, last year, and he's on the same page as us.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:07.222]  He sent me a bunch of articles and transcripts of everything he said now being confirmed.
[01:31:08.576 --> 01:31:12.680]  But you all remember, the thing is, he knows what they're up to.
[01:31:13.261 --> 01:31:15.042]  And that's what's even more horrifying about all this.
[01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:17.765]  This is Nazi technology, as he puts it.
[01:31:17.785 --> 01:31:20.849]  This is Josef Mengele by orders of magnitude.
[01:31:20.869 --> 01:31:22.891]  Not an order, orders of magnitude.
[01:31:23.371 --> 01:31:25.293]  Josef Mengele was tested on thousands of people.
[01:31:25.534 --> 01:31:28.156]  This is billions, billions of people.
[01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:31.938]  And again, in the fine print, they say doesn't protect you, may hurt you.
[01:31:32.239 --> 01:31:37.241]  But then Trump comes out and says, oh, it's safe, take it along, because Fauci told him to.
[01:31:37.321 --> 01:31:39.602]  So part of the reason I flipped out today is.
[01:31:40.618 --> 01:31:50.702]  I bet everything on Trump, and I don't think he's perfect, and I knew he didn't have all the answers, but seeing him in hindsight now endorse this, it's one thing to endorse it when they lied to him and said it was safe.
[01:31:51.022 --> 01:31:54.704]  Now they know it's dangerous and bad, and he's doubling down to cover his ass.
[01:31:55.084 --> 01:32:01.246]  That is the wrong move in my view, and probably precipitated my flipping out last segment.
[01:32:02.187 --> 01:32:05.388]  So, we're going to go to all of that.
[01:32:06.465 --> 01:32:06.805]  Coming up.
[01:32:06.825 --> 01:32:09.188]  Because all I've got is my integrity.
[01:32:09.448 --> 01:32:13.833]  And I, with Proviso's support of Trump, did not back these experimental vaccines.
[01:32:14.533 --> 01:32:19.859]  But now I am just beside myself here, trying to control myself.
[01:32:19.899 --> 01:32:23.443]  So I'm going to be very happy that Dr. Boyle is coming on, so I can kind of let him take over a little bit.
[01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:36.666]  Because when I'm reading all the admitted literature and the former heads of Pfizer and former heads of major companies saying, this is deadly, this is experimentation, this is insane, this won't help you, why are they doing this?
[01:32:37.626 --> 01:32:38.227]  Well, I know why.
[01:32:39.027 --> 01:32:45.849]  They're creating a global crisis, and then out of all the new illnesses, they're gonna say that's new strains of COVID, which your body then produces.
[01:32:45.869 --> 01:32:46.970]  I've got all the literature here.
[01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:53.632]  But Dr. Boyle's also joining us, and I'm glad he raised this, because I was gonna ask him this, didn't get it to him, he sent it to me.
[01:32:54.588 --> 01:32:56.490]  He says, as a lawyer, as the author of the U.S.
[01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:58.572]  Biological Weapons Law and a big contributor to the U.N.
[01:32:58.612 --> 01:33:06.480]  law, I can tell folks how this is a violation of their rights and what to say when they say you've got to happen to get on a bus or have a job or get on a train or an airplane.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:07.921]  And so this is big.
[01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:15.969]  This is an important interview coming up on the other side of this 60-second break with Dr. Francis Boyle, a professor, lawyer, author of the U.S.
[01:33:15.989 --> 01:33:16.850]  Biological Weapons Law.
[01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:22.687]  And I'm Alex Jones, just a wild Texan who's done his research, doesn't want to be a slave, and I'm fighting for humanity.
[01:33:23.008 --> 01:33:24.412]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:30.510]  All right, we really appreciate him taking time off from his busy class schedule.
[01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:33.610]  Dr. Francis Boyle is a renowned lawyer, author of the U.S.
[01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:36.631]  Biological Weapons Law, major contributor to the U.N.
[01:33:36.691 --> 01:33:37.411]  World Law.
[01:33:37.871 --> 01:33:41.852]  Also, he prosecuted Slobodan Milosevic and others in the Hague for war crimes.
[01:33:42.672 --> 01:33:44.232]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio.
[01:33:44.272 --> 01:33:46.733]  He's an author, a researcher, went to the same Ph.D.
[01:33:46.793 --> 01:33:54.274]  at Harvard that Henry Kissinger, and like one select person goes through a year when they're being tootled or given tutelage for the New World Order.
[01:33:55.294 --> 01:34:03.279]  And he came out and pointed out this was a biological weapon program out of the Chinese, Wuhan, with Bill Gates, with others, Fauci, probably leaked.
[01:34:03.819 --> 01:34:09.262]  A high-level State Department official has now come out and said that that's the information they have just yesterday.
[01:34:10.382 --> 01:34:12.724]  And so he predicted basically everything we're seeing.
[01:34:12.844 --> 01:34:21.889]  Now we've got even NPR coming out, but I've got mainline scientists saying that what these vaccines do, whether it's the
[01:34:23.843 --> 01:34:43.843]  Viral Vector Delivery System of AstraZeneca, or it's the mRNA of Pfizer and Moderna, is turn your cell into an engine of viruses, and that it also will cause autoimmune disorders, it'll cause cytokine storms, and now we're seeing that massive death unfolding.
[01:34:44.603 --> 01:34:46.525]  And we're seeing way more deaths from Pfizer,
[01:34:47.646 --> 01:34:49.447]  And from Moderna than even AstraZeneca.
[01:34:49.487 --> 01:34:50.747]  I'm not defending AstraZeneca.
[01:34:51.147 --> 01:34:53.728]  I'm just saying they seem to be scapegoating that, at least for now.
[01:34:54.369 --> 01:34:55.889]  And so he's deep in the literature.
[01:34:55.909 --> 01:34:57.270]  He studies it constantly.
[01:34:57.690 --> 01:35:00.491]  The drills that Bill and Melinda Gates had of this exact scenario.
[01:35:00.551 --> 01:35:06.153]  Crimson, contagion, a year before, Event 201, daring it to cover up what they were doing.
[01:35:06.173 --> 01:35:07.154]  That's why I think it was purposeful.
[01:35:07.614 --> 01:35:10.055]  He postulated, you know, that at least it was leaked.
[01:35:10.715 --> 01:35:13.217]  And top scientists scanned it and said it was manufactured.
[01:35:13.997 --> 01:35:21.602]  And so this is a jigsaw puzzle here of insanity, a global takeover, just absolutely out of control.
[01:35:22.042 --> 01:35:28.045]  But also, he's a constitutional lawyer, and he can speak to them saying, you've got to have this vaccine to travel.
[01:35:28.346 --> 01:35:32.308]  Because they're saying, oh, if you're unvaccinated, you're going to cause the plague to spread.
[01:35:32.328 --> 01:35:37.171]  But they admit, oh, actually, if you're vaccinated, you still got to wear a mask, still got to social distance, doesn't protect you.
[01:35:37.211 --> 01:35:38.411]  Well, Boyle said that a year ago.
[01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.808]  Any vaccine cannot be for this.
[01:35:41.848 --> 01:35:43.309]  This is based on a common cold.
[01:35:43.849 --> 01:35:44.790]  That's why they never had one.
[01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:45.751]  Well, now they admit that.
[01:35:46.191 --> 01:35:48.772]  So now they're saying dozens of vaccines.
[01:35:48.812 --> 01:35:50.353]  It was five vaccines six months ago.
[01:35:50.373 --> 01:35:52.215]  Now it's dozens to leave your house.
[01:35:52.895 --> 01:35:56.657]  So this is just madness on a scale never before dreamed of.
[01:35:56.697 --> 01:35:58.919]  So, Dr. Boyle, if you could recap where we are.
[01:35:59.799 --> 01:36:12.093]  What you predicted accurately so far and how people also have a notice to the system of their rights via the Geneva Convention and Nuremberg Code and more not to go under experimental vaccination.
[01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:14.495]  Now they're going after newborn babies, pregnant women.
[01:36:14.555 --> 01:36:19.381]  I mean, this is just the greatest exercise of evil I've ever imagined in my lifetime.
[01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:20.522]  Thank you for joining us, Dr. Boyle.
[01:36:21.721 --> 01:36:27.644]  Well, thank you for having me on again, Alex, and my best to your viewing audience again.
[01:36:27.704 --> 01:36:31.205]  And yes, we're in a terrible situation now.
[01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:39.329]  Before we go on, I did want to respond to your viewers and thank them.
[01:36:39.769 --> 01:36:41.310]  I hear from large numbers of them.
[01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:43.051]  They're always very polite, courteous.
[01:36:43.897 --> 01:36:47.279]  And I do the best I can to give them my advice.
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:37:01.546]  But one of the things your viewers asked me for, several, was something that they can use in their personal lives to resist these frankenshots, because there's no other word for them.
[01:37:01.767 --> 01:37:04.688]  Vaccines, that's baloney, that's propaganda.
[01:37:05.469 --> 01:37:09.831]  So what I did was sat down and I drafted a notice
[01:37:10.954 --> 01:37:16.239]  Uh, I sent you the notice, very short, very brief notice.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.065]  And you have my permission to circulate that notice on your, your webpage or your email or whatever.
[01:37:23.685 --> 01:37:30.992]  Just saying, you know, I hereby assert my rights under the Nuremberg Code of Medical Experimentation.
[01:37:31.741 --> 01:37:32.442]  Thank you.
[01:37:49.137 --> 01:37:57.164]  convicted and executed Nazi doctors for violating the Nuremberg Code of Medical Experimentation.
[01:37:57.624 --> 01:38:12.398]  I figured that would be enough to get everyone's notice and there might be a pause here before you are either forced to take this vaccine or if you're a health care worker to administer it.
[01:38:12.998 --> 01:38:13.299]  Yeah, I know.
[01:38:13.339 --> 01:38:13.679]  Well, that's fine.
[01:38:13.699 --> 01:38:14.700]  I don't care because generally I prefer
[01:38:27.816 --> 01:38:33.617]  Being responded to by email, it's easier for me to do than phone calls.
[01:38:33.697 --> 01:38:35.538]  But I'd be very gracious of you, sir.
[01:38:35.878 --> 01:38:44.019]  Okay, we will post this in the live show feed article today and people should circulate this and share it and other lawyers should pick it up as a notice.
[01:38:44.039 --> 01:38:48.700]  We should spend some time explaining the Geneva Convention, Nuremberg Code, because this is literally what this is.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.520]  Please continue.
[01:38:50.901 --> 01:38:51.121]  Right.
[01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:56.482]  And then accompanying the notice is an interview I gave for about 20 minutes.
[01:38:57.606 --> 01:39:00.267]  Explaining it line by line.
[01:39:01.007 --> 01:39:07.809]  So I would recommend that you post both the notice and the accompanying interview.
[01:39:07.849 --> 01:39:08.109]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.829]  Absolutely.
[01:39:08.849 --> 01:39:09.909]  We will post that right now.
[01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:17.972]  That would save me a lot of time because I don't have to review all this with everyone who gets in touch with me.
[01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:23.733]  But I did make this expressly at the request of your viewing audience.
[01:39:24.253 --> 01:39:25.934]  It's now in circulation.
[01:39:25.994 --> 01:39:26.874]  I've been told it's in
[01:39:27.412 --> 01:39:29.613]  Widespread circulation with U.S.
[01:39:29.693 --> 01:39:30.773]  military forces.
[01:39:31.733 --> 01:39:40.516]  It's in circulation there with health care workers, African Americans, and others.
[01:39:41.056 --> 01:39:45.018]  So you can fight back originally.
[01:39:45.058 --> 01:39:48.819]  And it seems to me if you show my notice at the beginning,
[01:39:49.449 --> 01:39:59.254]  Saying that the United States government prosecuted and executed German doctors for violating the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[01:39:59.814 --> 01:40:02.135]  Everyone's going to say, whoa, wait a second.
[01:40:02.596 --> 01:40:03.196]  But it's true.
[01:40:03.416 --> 01:40:04.317]  And that's what happened.
[01:40:04.837 --> 01:40:11.200]  And that is why I drafted it very short, very sweet, and leave it that way.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.782]  Now, putting that aside, if
[01:40:16.429 --> 01:40:22.956]  That'll cause, I think, people to think first before forcing you to do anything.
[01:40:23.636 --> 01:40:33.187]  And we'll give you some time, if necessary, if they go ahead and say, well, sorry, you know, you got to do this anyway.
[01:40:33.832 --> 01:40:40.336]  Hopefully you'll have time to get a hold, contact a lawyer near where you live.
[01:40:40.557 --> 01:40:51.704]  I'm only licensed to practice law in one state of the union, so I can't represent people all over the country, but I can work with your attorneys.
[01:40:52.325 --> 01:40:55.747]  And what you would have to do with your attorney
[01:40:56.803 --> 01:41:02.970]  Is first, show him or her, the attorney, my notice and the accompanying interview.
[01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:12.159]  And then the additional materials I just sent to Alex, he has my permission to put them on the webpage and circulate them.
[01:41:12.639 --> 01:41:18.946]  Have the attorney look at these materials, and then the attorney will have to research
[01:41:19.686 --> 01:41:33.578]  The state law in the state constitution in which you live, because, for example, some states have expressly incorporated the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation, like California.
[01:41:34.119 --> 01:41:38.483]  And again, I'm not authorized to represent anyone.
[01:41:39.243 --> 01:41:42.406]  Except one state, so I have to work with a local lawyer.
[01:41:42.466 --> 01:41:42.927]  I understand.
[01:41:42.947 --> 01:41:43.607]  We've got to go to break.
[01:41:43.627 --> 01:41:44.308]  I want to come back.
[01:41:44.368 --> 01:41:45.369]  You're gracious to do this.
[01:41:45.409 --> 01:41:46.110]  You're fighting hard.
[01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:59.081]  I want to get into the latest, the unfolding, massive medical experimentation, the deaths, what their plan is, why you think they're this crazed to carry something out like this, and then the big picture.
[01:41:59.161 --> 01:42:04.686]  For those that aren't an international top bioweapons lawyer, you're the top guy, admittedly, out of two or three people.
[01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:07.788]  Why they would violate the Nuremberg Code and Geneva Convention.
[01:42:07.808 --> 01:42:14.030]  This is well-known international law, the most known probably, the most famous, and this is 101 a violation.
[01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:19.211]  Like if I walked up to an innocent woman and shot her in the head at the grocery store in front of 100 people, I'm gonna go to death row.
[01:42:19.491 --> 01:42:22.632]  I mean, this is like burning down a church with gasoline on the news.
[01:42:22.712 --> 01:42:23.193]  It's illegal.
[01:42:23.693 --> 01:42:25.253]  This is totally out of control.
[01:42:25.573 --> 01:42:26.074]  No debate.
[01:42:26.114 --> 01:42:28.814]  Then what in the hell is Bill Gates doing?
[01:42:29.134 --> 01:42:30.955]  And why aren't we stopping him?
[01:42:31.695 --> 01:42:33.256]  We'll be right back with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:42:33.276 --> 01:42:33.616]  Stay there.
[01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:40.527]  So, medical tyranny in the last 150 years has really been the main mode.
[01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:46.895]  We saw the Soviet Union, we saw Nazi Germany, Communist China, those things that are just off the chart today.
[01:42:47.455 --> 01:42:48.936]  Animal-human cloning, you name it.
[01:42:49.337 --> 01:42:54.381]  Look what we've got going on with the Wuhan lab with a major State Department expert on bioweapons.
[01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:56.603]  I mean, I certainly believe it came out of Wuhan.
[01:42:56.623 --> 01:42:59.185]  Well, that's something Dr. Boyle said here over a year ago.
[01:42:59.205 --> 01:43:02.207]  Dr. Frances Boyle, lawyer, professor, author of the U.S.
[01:43:02.227 --> 01:43:03.168]  Biological Weapons Law.
[01:43:03.188 --> 01:43:05.790]  This is a nine-minute segment, longer segments coming up.
[01:43:06.451 --> 01:43:21.672]  Before we get into the latest developments of the vaccines and what's happening and all of this and the deaths and the countries banning them and the big tech censoring anybody that criticizes it or covers people dying from it, just pulling back because as a professor you like to cover what you can prove and as a lawyer.
[01:43:22.313 --> 01:43:24.876]  But Dr. Boyle, why would Gates and the U.N.
[01:43:24.976 --> 01:43:27.900]  and all them launch all this and do all this?
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:31.865]  Why would Big Pharma endanger themselves even though they have liability protection?
[01:43:31.925 --> 01:43:36.731]  Now there's criminal investigations in California and Italy because that's outside of civil protection.
[01:43:37.612 --> 01:43:38.173]  And immunity.
[01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:39.734]  People know what it's going to do.
[01:43:39.795 --> 01:43:41.597]  You're the lawyer, but it's criminal, correct?
[01:43:42.177 --> 01:43:49.045]  Why did Merck pull out of the whole vaccine program and say two months ago, you can't create a vaccine for this, just as you said a year ago?
[01:43:49.585 --> 01:43:51.067]  So why did Merck pull out?
[01:43:51.387 --> 01:43:52.729]  What do they know that others don't know?
[01:43:52.769 --> 01:43:59.216]  This just seems like such a reckless, insane gamble by Bill Gates and Fauci and the whole medical industrial complex.
[01:44:01.206 --> 01:44:08.831]  Well, Alex, it goes back to what I've said before, that we are seeing a Nazi mentality at work here.
[01:44:10.532 --> 01:44:17.958]  You see it in today's New York Times where they're going to be testing these frankenshots out on children.
[01:44:18.998 --> 01:44:28.585]  It's reminiscent of what Dr. Mengele did at Auschwitz with the children there and his experiments there.
[01:44:28.765 --> 01:44:29.906]  It's directly on point.
[01:44:30.872 --> 01:44:32.254]  What more can I say?
[01:44:32.354 --> 01:44:40.181]  The Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation requires animal experimentation first.
[01:44:40.982 --> 01:44:42.503]  They are not doing that.
[01:44:43.084 --> 01:44:46.647]  They are experimenting on human beings first.
[01:44:47.087 --> 01:44:48.949]  That's what we have to understand here.
[01:44:49.449 --> 01:44:56.376]  They are treating us, and now children, and now pregnant women, as their guinea pigs.
[01:44:57.252 --> 01:44:58.292]  It's that simple.
[01:44:59.193 --> 01:45:08.755]  And yes, violation of the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation is a violation of international criminal law today as we speak.
[01:45:09.275 --> 01:45:16.096]  And again, I drafted this notice for common, ordinary, everyday people to use.
[01:45:16.456 --> 01:45:18.137]  I'm happy to work when you get a lawyer.
[01:45:18.257 --> 01:45:19.797]  I'm happy to consult with your lawyer.
[01:45:21.578 --> 01:45:25.040]  It's been drafted in a way that can be used all over the world.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.082]  Anyone who wants to use it can use it for that reason.
[01:45:29.102 --> 01:45:30.003]  But I explained that.
[01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:32.425]  Sir, my question is why are they going for broke now?
[01:45:32.505 --> 01:45:33.445]  You're absolutely right.
[01:45:33.465 --> 01:45:34.206]  You predicted it all.
[01:45:34.646 --> 01:45:36.827]  Well, tell us what comes next then.
[01:45:36.887 --> 01:45:37.788]  These people are insane.
[01:45:40.171 --> 01:45:49.353]  Well, you know, you could say the Nazis were insane, but, you know, to get that PhD at Harvard, I had to study all about Nazi Germany.
[01:45:49.573 --> 01:45:52.834]  And, you know, these are, you know, human beings.
[01:45:52.914 --> 01:45:53.914]  They were evil.
[01:45:54.975 --> 01:45:57.835]  And that's pretty much what we are dealing with today.
[01:45:58.255 --> 01:46:09.538]  The COVID, we have to understand right at the beginning, if you read anything at all about this going on in the news media, no one will admit
[01:46:10.257 --> 01:46:30.014]  That what we are dealing with here is an existentially dangerous, offensive, biological warfare agent that has been DNA genetically engineered to have gain-of-function properties making it more lethal, more infectious.
[01:46:30.494 --> 01:46:34.458]  It has HIV DNA genetically engineered into that.
[01:46:35.198 --> 01:46:48.911]  And it has been aerosolized by means of nanotechnology and that all came out of the Wuhan BSL-4 in cooperation with the University of North Carolina BSL-3.
[01:46:50.792 --> 01:46:52.674]  And no one admits that.
[01:46:52.834 --> 01:46:54.375]  No one wants to deal with that.
[01:46:54.915 --> 01:46:57.977]  No one has come to grips with that.
[01:46:58.117 --> 01:47:00.679]  Now they're coming up with this cover story.
[01:47:01.079 --> 01:47:07.484]  Oh, well, it might have been vaccines that they were trying to make there in the Wuhan BSL-4.
[01:47:07.824 --> 01:47:08.565]  That's baloney.
[01:47:08.885 --> 01:47:12.247]  The Wuhan BSL-4 is China's Fort Detrick.
[01:47:12.427 --> 01:47:13.288]  It's that simple.
[01:47:13.748 --> 01:47:14.749]  That's why they made it.
[01:47:15.289 --> 01:47:20.153]  They figured the Americans have a Fort Detrick, so fine, we're going to have a Fort Detrick.
[01:47:21.174 --> 01:47:32.942]  So that's what they do at these labs, is research, development, tests, hideous, every type of hideous Nazi biological warfare weapon you can possibly imagine.
[01:47:32.963 --> 01:47:40.668]  Sure, well you've been dead on for the 20 years I've been interviewing you, at least about 19 to 20 years, but how the hell did you guess all this exactly as it unfolded?
[01:47:40.688 --> 01:47:41.889]  I guess just deep research?
[01:47:41.909 --> 01:47:42.570]  I guess that's what you do.
[01:47:44.093 --> 01:47:46.716]  That's correct, Alice.
[01:47:46.776 --> 01:48:02.977]  In 1983, the Council for Genetics was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and it was a lot of friends of mine from Harvard and MIT and other biologists and some of the top
[01:48:03.812 --> 01:48:06.854]  Uh, biologists in the world and the most ethical.
[01:48:07.334 --> 01:48:12.517]  And they asked me to get involved in, uh, their anti-biological warfare work.
[01:48:12.857 --> 01:48:15.239]  So that's how long I've been dealing with these issues.
[01:48:15.659 --> 01:48:22.003]  And that is how long I've been opposing these Nazi death scientists like Fauci.
[01:48:22.483 --> 01:48:24.764]  Fauci was put in there right around 1984, 1985.
[01:48:29.628 --> 01:48:44.023]  So he really is the prime mover from what I've seen day one, right around the time you got up to speed on this.
[01:48:44.403 --> 01:48:49.368]  He is inserted by these people and it seems like he just appears everywhere that the bad stuff is happening.
[01:48:50.649 --> 01:48:53.370]  He's their front man and their organizer.
[01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.630]  Right.
[01:48:53.750 --> 01:49:00.633]  Reagan and the neocons put him in charge of this because the neocons are in favor of biological warfare.
[01:49:01.273 --> 01:49:10.497]  And at the beginning of the Reagan administration, under the influence of the neoconservatives, I'm not saying, you know, President Reagan really knew what was going on.
[01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:10.917]  Okay.
[01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:13.358]  But under the influence of the neoconservatives.
[01:49:13.378 --> 01:49:13.778]  That's true.
[01:49:13.798 --> 01:49:16.059]  The horrible thing Reagan did was giving liability protection.
[01:49:16.119 --> 01:49:17.240]  Yeah, it was a horrible thing.
[01:49:18.462 --> 01:49:30.166]  Right, but under the influence of the neoconservatives, they began to abuse DNA genetic engineering to research, develop, and manufacture and stockpile biological weapons.
[01:49:30.306 --> 01:49:32.167]  And that's what I got involved in.
[01:49:33.608 --> 01:49:45.272]  And you explained their cover for bioweapons to get around the treaties is they call it a treatment, but then they have to engineer every possible thing under the sun, so they're actually making bioweapons in the name of finding treatments for things that didn't exist until they made them.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:46.960]  That's correct.
[01:49:47.701 --> 01:49:53.466]  And that's what a lot of this emerging infectious diseases is all about.
[01:49:53.506 --> 01:49:58.250]  If you read about, well, someone's an expert on emerging infectious diseases, right?
[01:49:58.650 --> 01:50:03.053]  They've emerged out of that person's biological warfare weapons lab, right?
[01:50:03.133 --> 01:50:05.115]  That's probably what... Well, that's the classic thing.
[01:50:05.155 --> 01:50:07.277]  They produce it, then they become the hero that fights it.
[01:50:08.257 --> 01:50:08.857]  That's correct.
[01:50:09.017 --> 01:50:10.838]  And they also make money off of it, too.
[01:50:11.038 --> 01:50:16.740]  And look at the enormous sums of money at stake here with Pharma and Fauci.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:21.641]  Fauci's got patents on all these biowarfare agencies.
[01:50:21.741 --> 01:50:21.961]  Right.
[01:50:22.261 --> 01:50:22.721]  Well, absolutely.
[01:50:22.761 --> 01:50:26.523]  How can he be the spokesman globally for all this or Bill Gates when they're heavily invested in all of it?
[01:50:26.863 --> 01:50:31.944]  This is literally them having controlled bioweapon releases that they get rich and get all the power off of.
[01:50:32.344 --> 01:50:32.805]  Incredible.
[01:50:32.845 --> 01:50:34.265]  Stay right there, Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:50:34.285 --> 01:50:34.965]  Two more segments.
[01:50:35.265 --> 01:50:36.666]  I want to drill into the vaccines.
[01:50:37.606 --> 01:50:42.690]  What they're doing and how they're trying to suppress the death and disease coming from it.
[01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:46.714]  And if they were just going to make money off a vaccine, why do they make it a placebo?
[01:50:46.794 --> 01:50:48.615]  Why is it so deadly?
[01:50:48.696 --> 01:50:53.660]  Well, I guess they're going to make money off of that or say it's a new bioweapon when people get sick off the vaccine.
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.521]  There's something big hiding here.
[01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:57.123]  We're going to figure it out straight ahead.
[01:50:58.427 --> 01:50:59.868]  Dr. Francis Boyle is our guest.
[01:51:00.089 --> 01:51:01.170]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.190 --> 01:51:07.155]  I'm going to take a little bit of the next hour when John Redford is coming up because I want to get to that special report that I promised we would.
[01:51:08.056 --> 01:51:16.364]  But listen, guys, I didn't get a PhD at Harvard like he did on globalism, but I did really get into studying world history because I was into comic books.
[01:51:16.545 --> 01:51:18.246]  I was an avid reader by about six.
[01:51:18.947 --> 01:51:20.829]  By about nine or ten, I started reading history books.
[01:51:22.503 --> 01:51:26.625]  By the time I was about 15, I was reading, you know, stuff that people are reading at college.
[01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:28.186]  And it was so interesting.
[01:51:28.446 --> 01:51:31.608]  And then I sort of seen parallels in our world to it, so I got into talk radio.
[01:51:33.249 --> 01:51:34.590]  Well, there's not parallels here.
[01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:42.014]  In the 1940s, early 1940s, the Nazis did the exact same type of stuff, but at a lower tech level that's happening now.
[01:51:42.374 --> 01:51:43.315]  That's what Dr. Boyle's saying.
[01:51:43.355 --> 01:51:46.036]  He's prosecuted people for these war crimes.
[01:51:46.657 --> 01:51:47.257]  Successfully.
[01:51:48.831 --> 01:51:53.753]  So it's not like we just got some random professor, some random lawyer, some random guy with a doctrine on.
[01:51:54.413 --> 01:51:55.113]  He's laying it out.
[01:51:55.193 --> 01:51:56.793]  He predicted a year ago what's happening now.
[01:51:56.813 --> 01:51:58.454]  It's not about, oh, isn't he great?
[01:51:59.034 --> 01:51:59.954]  He was wrong, I'll guarantee you.
[01:51:59.974 --> 01:52:00.475]  We can ask him.
[01:52:01.635 --> 01:52:02.695]  But what is Bill Gates?
[01:52:02.775 --> 01:52:03.576]  What is Moderna?
[01:52:03.636 --> 01:52:04.436]  What is Pfizer?
[01:52:04.476 --> 01:52:05.616]  What is AstraZeneca?
[01:52:05.716 --> 01:52:07.537]  What is Johnson & Johnson's thinking?
[01:52:08.447 --> 01:52:23.499]  When I know a bunch of people who've had their family die if they took it, or had convulsions and almost died, when lawyers that I know are having people want to sue, when a bunch of the crew has family that's taken these vaccines and couldn't get out of bed for a week, and then they admit, doesn't protect you.
[01:52:23.539 --> 01:52:26.321]  Well, every other vaccine at least had some partial protection.
[01:52:26.361 --> 01:52:30.064]  Why suddenly have they said, you still got to wear a mask, you still can't go out.
[01:52:30.464 --> 01:52:32.426]  We're still going to bring it because it's about control.
[01:52:33.506 --> 01:52:37.007]  And so why would they roll something out like this, lock everything down?
[01:52:37.047 --> 01:52:41.129]  Well, China made more billionaires than all countries combined last year.
[01:52:41.509 --> 01:52:45.950]  All the big tech companies got double or more their wealth in the last year.
[01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:50.532]  So I know Dr. Boyle says, well, probably accidental out of the lab.
[01:52:51.539 --> 01:52:52.740]  But we know it came out of the lab.
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:54.461]  Well, I see it as on purpose.
[01:52:54.481 --> 01:52:55.202]  They're in trouble.
[01:52:55.542 --> 01:52:56.263]  This is happening.
[01:52:56.323 --> 01:52:57.184]  Globalism's in trouble.
[01:52:57.324 --> 01:52:58.044]  It gets released.
[01:52:58.445 --> 01:52:59.486]  The media covers it up.
[01:52:59.526 --> 01:53:00.847]  They censor their opposition.
[01:53:01.287 --> 01:53:03.489]  And then they roll out a depopulation operation.
[01:53:03.529 --> 01:53:05.150]  But regardless, we're here.
[01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:06.932]  So, Dr. Boyle, I could ask a lot of questions.
[01:53:06.972 --> 01:53:10.935]  But instead, the time we have in this segment, the next, get into whatever you want to talk about.
[01:53:10.955 --> 01:53:12.937]  The vaccines, the numbers coming out.
[01:53:14.118 --> 01:53:16.480]  Again, even the New York Times admits, okay,
[01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:22.875]  NPR admits, yeah, these vaccines are probably going to lower your immunity to other natural things.
[01:53:22.915 --> 01:53:24.195]  And I'll show you a document after that.
[01:53:25.076 --> 01:53:28.839]  And yeah, it'll probably turn you into a factory of new deadly strains.
[01:53:28.859 --> 01:53:29.699]  I mean, here's NPR.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.602]  COVID-19 vaccines could add fuel to evolution of coronavirus mutations.
[01:53:34.042 --> 01:53:35.803]  And then I've got this big top scientist.
[01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:47.337]  One of the top guys in the world, Grit Von Bosch, says, top vaccine scientist warns the world, hold all COVID-19 vaccinations immediately or uncontrolled monster will be unleashed.
[01:53:48.057 --> 01:53:49.538]  And that's what they're all talking about.
[01:53:49.578 --> 01:53:51.579]  These aren't, this is a pro-vaccine guy, by the way.
[01:53:51.859 --> 01:53:54.561]  They're not normally talking like this doctor.
[01:53:54.601 --> 01:53:56.162]  Boy, let me show you one more piece of evidence.
[01:53:57.463 --> 01:54:04.087]  This is out of the Center for Strategic International Studies with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, November 2019.
[01:54:06.553 --> 01:54:11.777]  And this is their whole program, Ending the Cycle of Crisis and Complacency in the U.S.
[01:54:11.797 --> 01:54:12.878]  Global Health Security.
[01:54:12.918 --> 01:54:16.081]  It's part of the Crimson Contagion operation, predicting it.
[01:54:16.381 --> 01:54:19.023]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the main funders.
[01:54:19.284 --> 01:54:21.185]  I'll show you a shot right there for TV viewers, guys.
[01:54:21.946 --> 01:54:23.007]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:54:24.908 --> 01:54:27.090]  And it says right here, on page 17,
[01:54:29.392 --> 01:54:38.218]  Advances in biotechnology may foster the development of these new vaccines and therapeutics, but they also pose an additional risk as scientists develop and apply new biotechnologies.
[01:54:38.578 --> 01:54:44.682]  They may increase the transmissibility and pathogeneticity of naturally occurring microbes.
[01:54:45.063 --> 01:54:55.830]  With these changes come greater biosafety and biosecurity concerns and the rising possibility of accidental or intentional exposure of people, animals or environment to dangers and novel microbes.
[01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:59.292]  What you're saying they make and even the initiation of a global pandemic.
[01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:01.734]  Well, Alex, first let me give you an idea of what we are facing.
[01:55:01.754 --> 01:55:02.534]  I agree with you.
[01:55:02.915 --> 01:55:05.456]  We're fighting World War III here, and now it's a two-front war.
[01:55:05.496 --> 01:55:06.257]  First, it was against COVID-19.
[01:55:25.296 --> 01:55:27.737]  And I'm not trying to excuse the Chinese government.
[01:55:27.777 --> 01:55:29.397]  This was a predictable leak.
[01:55:29.457 --> 01:55:30.997]  I've been saying that for years.
[01:55:31.518 --> 01:55:36.839]  And then China, this communist dictatorship, covered it up right from the very get-go.
[01:55:36.919 --> 01:55:39.620]  Clearly a crime against humanity.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:43.841]  They could have brought it under control immediately, and they did not.
[01:55:44.321 --> 01:55:50.683]  And then the second front of World War III we're fighting are these Frankenshots.
[01:55:50.763 --> 01:55:52.063]  It's sort of like World War II.
[01:55:52.814 --> 01:56:01.062]  Starting with the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, and then Hitler declared war on us, and we're fighting a two-front war.
[01:56:02.084 --> 01:56:04.946]  Humanity is fighting the two-front war.
[01:56:05.367 --> 01:56:11.053]  Now, let me give you an estimate here of what a catastrophe these Frankenshots could be.
[01:56:11.738 --> 01:56:30.013]  I came to the pro bono defense of Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn, who refused to give frankenshots for biological warfare weapons in the run-up to Gulf War I because they violated the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[01:56:30.594 --> 01:56:33.516]  And I helped defend her pro bono starting in February 1991.
[01:56:33.656 --> 01:56:38.120]  I went down three times to Fort Leonard Wood.
[01:56:38.772 --> 01:56:39.533]  All right.
[01:56:54.656 --> 01:57:00.217]  Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell inflicting a Nuremberg crime on our own troops.
[01:57:00.337 --> 01:57:05.999]  That went out nationwide, even to the White House, where they heard it and they were quite upset.
[01:57:06.979 --> 01:57:12.420]  Later, Senator Rockefeller held hearings, and at the end of the hearings, he said the same thing.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.141]  These violated the Nuremberg Code on medical experimentation.
[01:57:17.681 --> 01:57:20.223]  That's the same for these frankenshots.
[01:57:20.283 --> 01:57:21.964]  And to your credit, you helped get it stopped.
[01:57:22.004 --> 01:57:24.546]  So the good news is, we've stopped this before, we can do it again.
[01:57:25.887 --> 01:57:26.107]  Right.
[01:57:26.428 --> 01:57:34.634]  But, the bottom line is, within about two years, I realized we had a humanitarian catastrophe on our hands.
[01:57:35.334 --> 01:57:43.961]  Out of 500,000 US troops who were forcibly inoculated with the original frankenshots, 11,000 were killed.
[01:57:46.082 --> 01:57:47.945]  And 100,000 were disabled.
[01:57:48.426 --> 01:57:52.992]  And those were healthy young men and women in our armed forces.
[01:57:53.593 --> 01:57:53.933]  Okay?
[01:57:54.354 --> 01:57:59.641]  So you can extrapolate from there, Alex, what is going to happen here.
[01:58:01.706 --> 01:58:06.053]  Just extrapolate when they're going to give these frankenshots to everyone.
[01:58:06.453 --> 01:58:13.644]  You take the figures I just gave you, 500,000 inoculated, 11,000 killed, and 100,000 disabled, healthy young men and women in our armed forces.
[01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:19.670]  This is going to be a catastrophe.
[01:58:19.690 --> 01:58:20.631]  So let's extrapolate.
[01:58:20.651 --> 01:58:22.132]  They want to vaccinate everybody on earth.
[01:58:22.172 --> 01:58:25.314]  Let's say they only get $6 billion, not $7.5 billion the next year.
[01:58:25.754 --> 01:58:30.356]  If we use comparable numbers, Doctor, we got 11,000 out of 500,000 dead.
[01:58:30.377 --> 01:58:31.237]  They admit that number.
[01:58:31.757 --> 01:58:34.539]  Then what is a comparable average out of that?
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:38.161]  I'm not even going to bother.
[01:58:39.842 --> 01:58:46.786]  What I am saying, Alex, this is the floor, not the ceiling, of what we are facing.
[01:58:47.307 --> 01:58:55.691]  Because these frankenshots are even more dangerous than the two that Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn opposed.
[01:58:56.111 --> 01:58:57.832]  So, the sky's the limit.
[01:58:57.952 --> 01:58:59.713]  I give you the floor.
[01:59:00.113 --> 01:59:03.255]  I guess you can have your numbers people figure all that out.
[01:59:03.615 --> 01:59:05.436]  Just try to figure out- Sure, you're giving us a floor and on a seat.
[01:59:05.456 --> 01:59:07.797]  We're talking about the greatest genocide in history.
[01:59:09.335 --> 01:59:15.819]  Well, I think, yeah, as I said, humanity is fighting a two-front war here against COVID-19.
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:31.349]  First, the offensive biological warfare weapon, existentially dangerous, predictably coming out of that Wuhan Fort Detrick that China covered up and could have contained immediately if they hopped to it, and they refused to do that.
[01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:33.311]  And now against the
[01:59:34.091 --> 01:59:35.252]  Frankenshots, right.
[01:59:35.532 --> 01:59:38.134]  So we're in a two-front World War III here.
[01:59:38.915 --> 01:59:45.220]  There's no doubt in my mind about it, and thank you for letting me come on here and describe it.
[01:59:45.641 --> 01:59:48.743]  I'm not trying to shock anyone or anything like that.
[01:59:48.883 --> 01:59:50.425]  I'm just trying to give you the truth
[01:59:51.045 --> 01:59:55.667]  As I see it, having worked on these matters professionally since 1983.
[01:59:55.727 --> 01:59:56.527]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:59:56.587 --> 02:00:03.150]  Do one more segment with us and talk more about what you think we can do, more about waivers, more about how to say no, more about what governors, Congress could do.
[02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:04.791]  Because, again, you're the guy that wrote the U.S.
[02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:05.631]  Biological Weapons Law.
[02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:07.792]  You're the guy that got them to stop the anthrax shots and others.
[02:00:07.812 --> 02:00:09.293]  I mean, you've been there every step of the way.
[02:00:09.313 --> 02:00:11.493]  That's why we're so honored to have Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:00:11.614 --> 02:00:16.596]  We'll tell you about, he never asked me to do this, but some of his books and things, as well as some of his interesting bio when we come back.
[02:00:16.636 --> 02:00:18.636]  But this is just unbelievable.
[02:00:18.877 --> 02:00:19.777]  And I know what they're going to do.
[02:00:20.157 --> 02:00:23.840]  I've read the literature, so I'll give you my speculation on the other side.
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:25.001]  They got this figured out.
[02:00:25.081 --> 02:00:27.443]  This is cooked up.
[02:00:27.563 --> 02:00:28.764]  They're definitely using the crisis.
[02:00:29.925 --> 02:00:32.768]  All right, final segment with Dr. Francis Boyle, author of the U.S.
[02:00:32.788 --> 02:00:33.889]  Biological Weapons Law.
[02:00:35.010 --> 02:00:40.214]  One of the head Nuremberg lawyers in war crimes, global expert, contributed to world law massively.
[02:00:40.634 --> 02:00:41.936]  So you couldn't get a better expert on it.
[02:00:42.016 --> 02:00:42.496]  It's just true.
[02:00:42.516 --> 02:00:44.398]  He doesn't do really a lot of other interviews.
[02:00:45.238 --> 02:00:45.758]  He's an author.
[02:00:45.798 --> 02:00:46.558]  He's a researcher.
[02:00:46.618 --> 02:00:47.979]  Just Google Francis Boyle.
[02:00:48.439 --> 02:00:49.239]  Francis A. Boyle.
[02:00:49.259 --> 02:00:50.159]  You'll find out more.
[02:00:50.519 --> 02:00:52.700]  His latest book is Poems Against the Empire.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:59.441]  He's written books on bioweapons, bioweapons law, exposed that the anthrax attacks were an inside job.
[02:00:59.881 --> 02:01:00.961]  It just goes on and on.
[02:01:00.981 --> 02:01:03.482]  I've been interviewing him again since right after 9-11.
[02:01:03.882 --> 02:01:07.743]  He began to come on the broadcast and expose the deep state's involvement.
[02:01:08.523 --> 02:01:12.844]  But pulling back here, the reason I'm really concerned is the recklessness of this.
[02:01:13.977 --> 02:01:14.657]  I'll go back to this.
[02:01:14.757 --> 02:01:21.059]  Merck pulls out two months ago and says you can't make a vaccine for this and actually this will create viruses.
[02:01:21.579 --> 02:01:22.859]  Exactly what Boyle and others said.
[02:01:22.919 --> 02:01:24.800]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:26.340]  25 countries in Europe have pulled out.
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.641]  Over 100 worldwide have pulled out of different vaccines.
[02:01:29.041 --> 02:01:32.982]  India pulled out of the Merck, the Pfizer vaccine, that was causing death.
[02:01:33.522 --> 02:01:37.383]  But still our media goes ahead and Trump says there's no problem.
[02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:39.744]  It's totally safe taken on Fox Business.
[02:01:40.766 --> 02:01:47.127]  And it's one thing if Trump got bamboozled into it early on to reopen the economy, but now there's all this death and all these problems.
[02:01:47.647 --> 02:01:49.888]  This is a deal-breaker for me with Trump.
[02:01:50.528 --> 02:01:55.269]  And I know he's not president now, but Fauci says, we need Trump to come out and say, take the shot.
[02:01:55.609 --> 02:02:01.130]  And then like a lap dog, he snapped your fingers and the dog gets, you know, on its hind legs begging for a treat.
[02:02:01.410 --> 02:02:02.010]  Trump does it.
[02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:04.210]  I don't want to get into a Trump bashing fest here.
[02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:06.231]  It's just, this is very worrying to me.
[02:02:06.271 --> 02:02:07.331]  So two points, doctor.
[02:02:07.731 --> 02:02:08.471]  Why do you think
[02:02:09.351 --> 02:02:10.832]  Good sign countries are pulling out.
[02:02:10.912 --> 02:02:11.993]  Good sign Merck pulled out.
[02:02:12.073 --> 02:02:13.413]  What do you think's going on there?
[02:02:13.774 --> 02:02:15.795]  But then why would the other companies double down?
[02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:19.817]  And then what do you think about Trump endorsing this Franken-poison?
[02:02:21.918 --> 02:02:27.341]  Yes, they're doubling down, I think, because they realize people are fighting back, Alex.
[02:02:27.401 --> 02:02:34.745]  And that's why I'm being here on your show, and I've been on your show since last February, to fight back.
[02:02:35.814 --> 02:02:46.842]  Inform people what is actually going on here behind the scenes, because we all know our media lies to us.
[02:02:47.102 --> 02:02:49.544]  I mean, this is worse than the old Soviet Union.
[02:02:49.944 --> 02:02:57.230]  I've been over there, I lectured, and the people in the Soviet Union knew their media were lying to them, where unfortunately
[02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:08.187]  So few people here in America are aware that I learned that years ago during the Vietnam War when all the news media supported the Vietnam War.
[02:03:09.264 --> 02:03:11.906]  As for Trump, look, I'm not going to talk about Trump.
[02:03:12.287 --> 02:03:13.688]  Let's talk about Biden.
[02:03:14.529 --> 02:03:30.186]  I've been up against Biden twice, personally and directly, in his capacity of chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on existential human rights matters concerning my own people, the Irish, this being St.
[02:03:30.206 --> 02:03:30.907]  Patrick's Day.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:35.901]  And Biden sold us out twice to the British.
[02:03:36.421 --> 02:03:42.443]  The first time I beat Biden out and the second time I stopped him and fought him to a draw.
[02:03:42.943 --> 02:03:47.284]  I am telling you now, Biden is going on this national tour.
[02:03:47.604 --> 02:03:49.005]  He has this new campaign.
[02:03:49.425 --> 02:03:52.806]  You can't believe one thing Biden is telling you.
[02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:58.687]  As for his Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, he was behind me at Harvard Law School.
[02:03:59.167 --> 02:04:06.449]  Ron Klain was Obama's Ebola czar, also behind the Obama administration.
[02:04:06.489 --> 02:04:07.830]  And let's slow down, that's key.
[02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:10.090]  The man you mentioned, they say, really runs the White House.
[02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:12.711]  I think that's correct.
[02:04:13.111 --> 02:04:21.733]  I think that you've got a triumvirate of Harris, Klain, Jake Sullivan doing foreign affairs, and they consult behind the scenes with
[02:04:22.857 --> 02:04:24.418]  Pelosi and Schumer.
[02:04:24.558 --> 02:04:24.798]  Right.
[02:04:25.338 --> 02:04:31.701]  I'm afraid with Biden, we're sort of like we were with the second Trump administration.
[02:04:31.741 --> 02:04:33.441]  Everyone knows Trump had Alzheimer's.
[02:04:33.461 --> 02:04:36.463]  Sorry, that Reagan administration.
[02:04:36.523 --> 02:04:40.744]  Reagan had Alzheimer's in the second term.
[02:04:40.884 --> 02:04:42.525]  So it's a true puppet administration.
[02:04:43.786 --> 02:04:49.368]  Well, the truth is that Klain covered up
[02:04:50.191 --> 02:04:54.395]  The Ebola catastrophe for Obama.
[02:04:55.075 --> 02:04:57.157]  You can read my writings I've sent to you.
[02:04:57.677 --> 02:05:02.601]  That Ebola catastrophe came out of the U.S.
[02:05:02.682 --> 02:05:05.104]  government's Kenema BSL-4.
[02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:14.311]  They were testing out Big Pharma, an experimental Ebola vaccine that gave everyone Ebola and killed 12,000
[02:05:16.733 --> 02:05:18.834]  Uh, black, uh, West Africans.
[02:05:19.474 --> 02:05:22.796]  And, uh, uh, Klain covered it all up for Obama.
[02:05:23.276 --> 02:05:30.279]  And then second, worst of all, Obama ordered 2,500 members of U.S.
[02:05:30.399 --> 02:05:40.343]  armed forces right over there into Liberia, right in the hotspot where they could have been contaminated by Ebola.
[02:05:41.176 --> 02:05:42.457]  As a propaganda stunt.
[02:05:42.797 --> 02:05:47.120]  Now, fortunately, from what I have read, no U.S.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:52.284]  troops were contaminated over there in Ebola, but they were deliberately exposed.
[02:05:52.504 --> 02:05:59.108]  I mentioned to you before, I was consulted on this by the late Congressman Walter Jones.
[02:05:59.669 --> 02:06:01.029]  They were all his constituents.
[02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.550]  That's right.
[02:06:01.570 --> 02:06:03.031]  You warned about it while it was happening.
[02:06:03.051 --> 02:06:05.412]  It turned out you were accurate again, for whatever sources you have.
[02:06:06.093 --> 02:06:09.675]  They were trying to bring Ebola patients back to Texas and Georgia.
[02:06:09.715 --> 02:06:10.676]  What the hell was that about?
[02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:12.997]  Right, well it's very dangerous.
[02:06:13.858 --> 02:06:14.499]  What could I say?
[02:06:14.559 --> 02:06:21.363]  But I discussed this at great length with Congressman Jones to try to stop U.S.
[02:06:21.403 --> 02:06:29.449]  troops from being sent over there to the hot zone at the request of Obama and Klain, the order of Obama and Klain.
[02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:34.333]  And unfortunately, someone threatened Congressman Jones.
[02:06:35.073 --> 02:06:43.561]  He must have been a very powerful person because Congressman Jones, as you know, was a senior Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.
[02:06:43.601 --> 02:06:46.304]  And Jones would no longer work with me.
[02:06:46.364 --> 02:06:51.088]  And I'm not criticizing Jones, but, you know, he's no longer with us.
[02:06:51.168 --> 02:06:52.349]  I think it was very courageous.
[02:06:52.429 --> 02:06:52.990]  Absolutely.
[02:06:53.530 --> 02:06:55.652]  In closing, I know you don't want to bash Trump.
[02:06:55.672 --> 02:06:57.013]  Mr. Bash Trump, he's out of office now.
[02:06:58.528 --> 02:06:58.869]  I agree.
[02:06:58.909 --> 02:06:59.910]  It's all a doubling down.
[02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:06.997]  Everyone that's now signed on to this who wasn't originally a party to the evil, they now make themselves a party to evil trying to cover it up.
[02:07:07.297 --> 02:07:08.138]  They need to come clean.
[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:10.621]  That's right.
[02:07:10.761 --> 02:07:12.803]  And the people
[02:07:13.952 --> 02:07:29.676]  Like Fauci, who developed these Nazi biological warfare weapons, are now advising Biden and Klain on the frankenshots, that now we have to take their frankenshots as well.
[02:07:30.616 --> 02:07:39.479]  And Biden is going on the national tour, Harris is on the tour, her husband's on the tour, trying to encourage everyone to take the frankenshots.
[02:07:39.919 --> 02:07:41.279]  This is what we're facing, Ellis.
[02:07:42.114 --> 02:07:42.735]  All right.
[02:07:55.985 --> 02:07:57.727]  And these Franken shots.
[02:07:58.107 --> 02:08:06.834]  Under these circumstances, I would just encourage everyone to search your conscience and ask yourself, what can I do?
[02:08:07.174 --> 02:08:17.563]  I have talents here that I can use, that I can put to work to try to stop this and fight back on behalf of humanity.
[02:08:17.603 --> 02:08:18.904]  And yes, we're seeing people
[02:08:19.264 --> 02:08:28.716]  Absolutely, and if people go to InfoWars.com, they can see the live show feed today with the title of the show, World Exclusive, Globalist Playing Control of the End of the World.
[02:08:35.465 --> 02:08:37.227]  By that, I mean the Collapse of Civilization Watch Live.
[02:08:37.547 --> 02:08:48.897]  If you scroll down, we have your waiver that you've written graciously with your information on that page for everybody with the legal information and your email right there.
[02:08:48.917 --> 02:08:52.961]  If it's not there, it will be added, but I do believe there it is.
[02:08:53.801 --> 02:08:54.142]  Absolutely.
[02:08:54.162 --> 02:08:54.602]  So there it is.
[02:08:54.642 --> 02:08:55.283]  Great job, crew.
[02:08:56.223 --> 02:08:58.185]  Thank you so much, Dr. Boyle.
[02:08:58.205 --> 02:09:02.107]  We will talk to you again as soon as you can.
[02:09:02.127 --> 02:09:03.628]  I know you've got full classes and the rest of it.
[02:09:03.648 --> 02:09:04.248]  This is a global crisis.
[02:09:04.268 --> 02:09:04.908]  Thank you so much.
[02:09:16.704 --> 02:09:23.386]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me on, and I cannot underestimate the catastrophe that faces humanity today.
[02:09:23.466 --> 02:09:25.806]  It's just like after Pearl Harbor or something.
[02:09:25.846 --> 02:09:27.247]  We all have to volunteer here.
[02:09:27.767 --> 02:09:28.087]  Absolutely.
[02:09:28.107 --> 02:09:28.467]  Thank you, sir.
[02:09:28.967 --> 02:09:31.068]  Yeah, folks, I can handle a lot of stuff.
[02:09:31.208 --> 02:09:33.748]  I have nerves of steel, okay?
[02:09:34.169 --> 02:09:35.449]  And I'm starting to crack up, okay?
[02:09:37.876 --> 02:09:39.397]  I mean, this is damn pure poison.
[02:09:39.617 --> 02:09:40.477]  Doesn't help anybody.
[02:09:40.497 --> 02:09:41.018]  It's pure evil.
[02:09:41.058 --> 02:09:42.478]  And I read about them giving it to newborn babies.
[02:09:42.799 --> 02:09:44.179]  I mean, I'm having a lot of problems.
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.140]  Next hour's coming up.
[02:09:46.321 --> 02:09:48.442]  I never got to our big report, Agenda 2035, to find.
[02:09:48.462 --> 02:09:50.563]  We're going to air part of it.
[02:09:50.623 --> 02:09:51.603]  It's on Bandot Video.
[02:09:52.304 --> 02:09:55.045]  I'm going to air it on the show tomorrow because a lot of folks won't go to Bandot Video.
[02:09:55.505 --> 02:09:56.526]  Millions listen to the show.
[02:09:56.826 --> 02:10:01.529]  This is their plan, their operation, a controlled collapse of the world as we know it.
[02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:03.690]  That's at Band.Video.
[02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:05.831]  It's also linked at the top of Infowars.com.
[02:10:05.851 --> 02:10:10.995]  The Agenda 2035 plan for the controlled collapse of the world system.
[02:10:11.955 --> 02:10:13.336]  It just could not be more vital.
[02:10:13.396 --> 02:10:16.758]  Agenda 2035, the post-human world, controlled planetary collapse.
[02:10:16.818 --> 02:10:18.419]  It needs 100 million views.
[02:10:18.439 --> 02:10:20.641]  We could save the planet if we were able to do it.
[02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:24.765]  Please don't forget, today is the last day for free shipping store-wide.
[02:10:25.246 --> 02:10:34.155]  Free shipping up to 50% off products like X2, X3, things like the Ultimate Krill oils, 40% off with free shipping.
[02:10:34.535 --> 02:10:39.281]  And that's what funds our operation, plus our great products and the natural compounds God gave us that will battle back against this.
[02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:41.042]  Well, the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:41.062 --> 02:10:43.804]  After several weeks in the hospital, 99-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, father of Prince Charles,
[02:11:10.646 --> 02:11:15.808]  Was photographed looking like the Crypt Keeper, looking far worse than Joe Biden.
[02:11:16.248 --> 02:11:20.529]  And we're not wishing ill of the dead here.
[02:11:21.169 --> 02:11:23.810]  We are witnessing ill of the damned.
[02:11:24.651 --> 02:11:35.594]  He looks like the final scenes of The Hunger, where the vampire has lost his supposed immortality to the master vampire.
[02:11:35.674 --> 02:11:37.615]  Truly horrifying images.
[02:11:42.298 --> 02:11:44.759]  And this is somebody that gets the blood transfusions.
[02:11:44.779 --> 02:11:49.402]  This is somebody that says he wants to come back as a virus to kill the majority of us.
[02:11:49.962 --> 02:11:54.324]  And there he is looking deep into the pits of hell.
[02:11:55.825 --> 02:12:04.169]  A globalist, a world government promoter, and look how scared that soul looks as he prepares to enter Hades.
[02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:07.171]  And so they had a lot of fun with the memes.
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:10.822]  But it's actually deadly, deadly serious.
[02:12:11.583 --> 02:12:13.464]  Yeah, I mean, he looks about like the guy from The Hunger.
[02:12:13.484 --> 02:12:13.925]  There he is.
[02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:16.307]  And of course, they do never die.
[02:12:16.407 --> 02:12:19.750]  They just turn into a zombie at the end and they get put into a tomb forever.
[02:12:21.912 --> 02:12:26.136]  So, that's where the Duke of Edinburgh... Let's put him back on screen.
[02:12:26.716 --> 02:12:31.661]  The Duke of Edinburgh, that's where Queen Elizabeth, that's where all of them are going.
[02:12:31.701 --> 02:12:33.762]  That's where Bill Gates is going with his father.
[02:12:34.582 --> 02:12:35.583]  He'll be joining his mother.
[02:12:36.344 --> 02:12:38.025]  That's where Ted Turner's going.
[02:12:38.065 --> 02:12:39.506]  That's where Oprah Winfrey's going.
[02:12:40.307 --> 02:12:42.609]  They're gonna have all these evil goons and all this scum.
[02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:43.730]  Yeah, that's him like a year ago.
[02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:47.193]  Looking a little, a little Count Dracula there, but having a little more fun.
[02:12:48.254 --> 02:12:53.439]  He is certainly, uh, certainly enjoying himself, but let's show the new photos.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:54.920]  There he is.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:55.761]  We gotta blow that up.
[02:12:56.301 --> 02:13:00.085]  As he circles the intergalactic toilet bowl.
[02:13:03.428 --> 02:13:04.209]  And go back to the memes.
[02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:06.590]  There's some really good ones on the Infowars.com article.
[02:13:06.991 --> 02:13:07.891]  Everybody should go there.
[02:13:07.911 --> 02:13:08.852]  Everybody should check them out.
[02:13:09.713 --> 02:13:11.134]  Because, yeah, there you go.
[02:13:11.534 --> 02:13:15.977]  Because that's where this old boy is going to be going.
[02:13:16.718 --> 02:13:19.620]  He sold out his country, but he's not even British.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:20.500]  He's not even German.
[02:13:21.361 --> 02:13:22.602]  He's not even Transylvanian.
[02:13:23.723 --> 02:13:31.028]  Nobody really knows where those people that took over that area came from, but they're nasty, and they're evil, and they're sneaky.
[02:13:32.682 --> 02:13:36.904]  And he and his son, Prince Charles, are servants of the devil.
[02:13:37.064 --> 02:13:38.405]  They all love Jimmy Savelle.
[02:13:38.445 --> 02:13:39.225]  They all think it's cute.
[02:13:39.245 --> 02:13:40.586]  They think children belong to them.
[02:13:41.206 --> 02:13:46.689]  They think that we're all just these animals they can rule over, but that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:47.630 --> 02:13:50.831]  All right, I think I did a good job this morning.
[02:13:52.192 --> 02:13:53.092]  Let me finish at one point.
[02:13:53.433 --> 02:13:54.273]  That's the undead.
[02:13:54.493 --> 02:13:57.455]  All the science can keep him alive, but if
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:05.645]  Google and Facebook and Twitter CEOs and Ray Kurzweil think they're all going to stay alive because they have millions of dollars.
[02:14:06.806 --> 02:14:09.788]  The soul is going to give up the body.
[02:14:10.188 --> 02:14:11.269]  Christ gave up the ghost.
[02:14:12.529 --> 02:14:14.591]  And so that's like the portrait of Darian Gray.
[02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:15.832]  Darian Gray.
[02:14:17.037 --> 02:14:20.159]  And no matter what you do or what you say, you will not still be alive.
[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:31.588]  That's why they're saying a man and a woman are bad, and you can't say that a man can't be a woman or a woman can't be a man, because they're going to have transhumans that are really machines that are corporate entities that have rights.
[02:14:32.529 --> 02:14:44.358]  And they'll say that somebody uploaded to that and gave all their money to that machine, that's really going to be a machine controlled by a big corporation with a back door, this is the big secret, that isn't alive and is controlled, but has rights.
[02:14:46.258 --> 02:14:51.661]  And everyone will have to bow down to it and go along with it, so that's why you can't say trans this, trans that.
[02:14:53.202 --> 02:15:11.194]  That's why you're not allowed to say this, because they're going to say computers have rights, robots have rights, because they're going to be these avatars of these supposedly dead people, and the big fraud is, oh, Ted Turner's still alive, oh, James Cameron's still alive, oh, Bill Gates is still alive, but they won't be.
[02:15:11.974 --> 02:15:16.855]  It'll just be a corporate machine that has a voice print of them, can sound like them, but isn't them.
[02:15:17.295 --> 02:15:22.196]  Because they want to pretend like they can escape death and escape judgment, and they will not escape death.
[02:15:22.416 --> 02:15:23.996]  They will not escape judgment.
[02:15:24.036 --> 02:15:25.056]  They will burn in hell.
[02:15:25.336 --> 02:15:26.677]  Burn in hell, Prince Philip.
[02:15:26.977 --> 02:15:28.197]  Burn in hell!
[02:15:28.217 --> 02:15:30.237]  Hello, everybody.
[02:15:30.257 --> 02:15:31.578]  John Rappaport here.
[02:15:31.758 --> 02:15:35.178]  InfoWars for the rest of this hour.
[02:15:35.198 --> 02:15:35.358]  Germany.
[02:15:40.353 --> 02:15:42.134]  Germany, Germany, Germany.
[02:15:43.634 --> 02:15:45.495]  It's a very important country in Europe.
[02:15:46.175 --> 02:15:50.176]  Economic powerhouse of the European Union.
[02:15:52.117 --> 02:15:55.618]  People don't ignore what is happening in Germany.
[02:15:57.178 --> 02:16:01.460]  I presume everybody here has heard of Angela Merkel.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:06.101]  She is the Chancellor of Germany, I think, since about 1946.
[02:16:10.114 --> 02:16:12.916]  Not quite that long, but she's been there for a long time.
[02:16:14.797 --> 02:16:17.238]  Very important politician.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.120]  Very, very important.
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.061]  So guess what?
[02:16:23.022 --> 02:16:35.209]  Underreported, certainly in mainstream media in the U.S., Angela Merkel has refused to take the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine.
[02:16:36.470 --> 02:16:36.891]  Herself.
[02:16:37.971 --> 02:16:38.532]  In the arm.
[02:16:38.692 --> 02:16:39.212]  In her arm.
[02:16:40.094 --> 02:16:41.996]  She's refused to take it.
[02:16:44.357 --> 02:16:44.658]  Yeah.
[02:16:45.838 --> 02:16:46.819]  Firestorm.
[02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:50.342]  Here is her reasoning.
[02:16:51.623 --> 02:17:05.213]  In Germany, the vaccine is only licensed or approved or emergency authorized for people up to and including 65 years old.
[02:17:06.554 --> 02:17:07.915]  And Angola is 66.
[02:17:11.152 --> 02:17:21.080]  So to be very precise, she therefore says, I am not in the group for which the vaccine has been approved.
[02:17:21.761 --> 02:17:24.763]  Therefore, I'm not personally going to take it.
[02:17:27.966 --> 02:17:38.054]  Needless to say, this caused some apoplexy and cardiac tremors, boiling point, blood pressure,
[02:17:39.053 --> 02:17:45.939]  In political leaders, in pharmaceutical companies, all over Europe and the world.
[02:17:45.959 --> 02:17:53.086]  The Chancellor of Germany says she is not taking the vaccine herself.
[02:17:54.987 --> 02:18:03.635]  What we're seeing folks is the pro-vaccine forces are beginning to eat their own.
[02:18:05.729 --> 02:18:10.532]  There are divisions and dissensions within their ranks.
[02:18:11.533 --> 02:18:16.576]  There are arguments and conflicts breaking out at all levels.
[02:18:17.897 --> 02:18:34.607]  There are scientists and doctors and nurses and all kinds of people coming forward and saying, not only are they not taking the vaccine, but there are very good reasons why other people shouldn't be taking the vaccine.
[02:18:38.075 --> 02:18:53.748]  In Germany, Merkel's stance has prompted, suddenly, the German authorities to switch ground and say out of nowhere, guess what?
[02:18:54.428 --> 02:19:03.936]  The vaccine is now approved for people over the age of 65 because we've determined that the data are good and is safe and effective.
[02:19:05.938 --> 02:19:07.579]  Nobody believes this crap.
[02:19:09.463 --> 02:19:21.447]  Nobody believes that the German Vaccine Regulatory Commission has suddenly discovered that the vaccine is safe and effective for people over the age of 65.
[02:19:22.488 --> 02:19:25.509]  They're just trying to cover their butts.
[02:19:26.289 --> 02:19:31.011]  They're just trying to diminish the firestorm of controversy.
[02:19:31.831 --> 02:19:35.232]  And they are just trying to get Angela Merkel
[02:19:35.874 --> 02:19:42.337]  To take the friggin' vaccine in her own arm and stop the conflict and the controversy.
[02:19:44.538 --> 02:19:51.781]  As of about an hour before the show today, I see no evidence that she is backing down.
[02:19:53.822 --> 02:19:57.564]  She has not come out and said that she is going to take the vaccine.
[02:19:58.124 --> 02:19:58.624]  She may.
[02:19:58.644 --> 02:19:59.725]  She may.
[02:19:59.745 --> 02:20:04.627]  There are people in Germany that are urging her to do it on television.
[02:20:06.266 --> 02:20:27.979]  In order to, you know, allow all kinds of people over the age of 65, for whom the vaccine has not been approved in Germany, to step up and take the shot and keel over and, you know, incur massive damage and die.
[02:20:31.041 --> 02:20:34.803]  So that's headlines from Germany, which are quite fantastic.
[02:20:35.595 --> 02:20:39.337]  If you care to stop and think about that, which I do.
[02:20:42.639 --> 02:20:49.683]  Roughly nine countries at last count have decided to pause.
[02:20:50.463 --> 02:20:51.324]  I love that word.
[02:20:52.164 --> 02:20:54.445]  You know, he pressed pause.
[02:20:55.346 --> 02:21:01.269]  That means he's going to unpause, but he's just temporarily putting this on hold.
[02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:04.251]  Nine countries have paused
[02:21:05.191 --> 02:21:22.002]  The AstraZeneca COVID vaccine because of a few cases, their words, of blood clots, which are being investigated to see if they have any relationship with the vaccine.
[02:21:23.383 --> 02:21:28.206]  And if you believe that story, I have condos on the far side of the moon to sell you.
[02:21:30.187 --> 02:21:34.690]  Countries are not pausing the vaccine.
[02:21:35.902 --> 02:21:41.425]  Because of a few stories about blood clots.
[02:21:42.726 --> 02:21:51.912]  There are major worries and concern within the pro-vaccine ranks, as I'm describing to you.
[02:21:52.992 --> 02:21:56.434]  Conflicts are breaking out massively.
[02:21:57.755 --> 02:22:03.919]  An internal war is developing among the pro-COVID vax people.
[02:22:06.075 --> 02:22:21.907]  Whatever they are, quote, investigating, in other words, covering up, or trying to cover up, is far more than a few questionable cases of blood clots that may or may not be connected to the COVID vaccine.
[02:22:22.508 --> 02:22:24.950]  It's a hell of a lot more than that, you can be sure.
[02:22:27.852 --> 02:22:33.276]  An entire country's government is not going to say, we are stopping
[02:22:34.653 --> 02:22:46.060]  The vaccination, the COVID vaccination of everybody, the AstraZeneca vaccine, because of this concern over a few cases of blood clots.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.441]  Don't buy that for a second.
[02:22:51.023 --> 02:22:58.967]  There are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, quote, adverse reactions to the vaccine and many serious ones.
[02:22:59.688 --> 02:23:02.550]  And people are keeling over and people are dying.
[02:23:05.293 --> 02:23:06.014]  In the U.S.
[02:23:06.074 --> 02:23:20.906]  alone, in droves, black Americans, hospital personnel, soldiers, those three groups among others, are refusing the COVID vaccine.
[02:23:23.648 --> 02:23:34.837]  And we've seen articles saying, mainstream articles, that military commanders are very concerned about their soldiers turning down
[02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:36.874]  The vaccine.
[02:23:37.975 --> 02:23:38.776]  Look at that headline.
[02:23:39.316 --> 02:23:40.117]  75% of U.S.
[02:23:40.157 --> 02:23:45.461]  troops refused taking COVID-19 vaccines, says Pentagon report.
[02:23:46.282 --> 02:23:46.602]  Wow.
[02:23:48.143 --> 02:23:49.584]  There's more, a lot more.
[02:23:49.684 --> 02:23:50.225]  Stay with us.
[02:23:50.305 --> 02:23:51.485]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:23:52.406 --> 02:24:04.115]  So as I was saying before the break, when nine countries decide that they're going to stop the vaccination campaign, COVID, the AstraZeneca vaccine,
[02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:06.661]  You know something's happening here.
[02:24:07.201 --> 02:24:10.003]  It's not just a few blood clots, like they're saying.
[02:24:11.223 --> 02:24:22.390]  There's some serious events taking place, serious injuries and deaths in numbers that are happening behind the scenes that they are not reporting.
[02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:25.972]  Otherwise, they wouldn't be stopping this.
[02:24:27.973 --> 02:24:33.816]  And why are hospital workers in droves refusing to take the vaccine?
[02:24:35.069 --> 02:24:35.830]  What do they know?
[02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:48.099]  I mean, they're not, excuse me, they're not just dumb people who are saying, well, you know, I don't know, vaccine.
[02:24:48.439 --> 02:24:50.080]  No, they're in the business.
[02:24:51.001 --> 02:24:57.906]  They're in the business of praising vaccines and giving vaccines to people and injecting them in their arms.
[02:24:58.887 --> 02:25:03.190]  So if they're refusing the COVID vaccine in droves, again,
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:06.762]  You know something is going on, something extremely serious.
[02:25:07.762 --> 02:25:08.083]  You know?
[02:25:08.103 --> 02:25:11.765]  I mean, this is obvious stuff.
[02:25:13.266 --> 02:25:15.487]  Major media, of course, are not playing this up.
[02:25:15.527 --> 02:25:24.512]  They wouldn't dare say on CNN or the New York Times, what do these hospital workers know that we don't?
[02:25:26.253 --> 02:25:29.695]  Why are they refusing the vaccine in droves?
[02:25:31.496 --> 02:25:32.457]  Let's talk to them.
[02:25:33.516 --> 02:25:34.797]  Not just two or three.
[02:25:35.237 --> 02:25:36.598]  Let's talk to a lot of them.
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:40.400]  That's not going to happen.
[02:25:41.341 --> 02:25:47.525]  Because what's going to come out is these people are going to say, well, yes, I work in a hospital, so I know about these things.
[02:25:48.886 --> 02:25:53.348]  This is emergency use authorization only.
[02:25:53.929 --> 02:25:55.850]  This is not real approval.
[02:25:56.370 --> 02:25:58.652]  This is an experimental vaccine.
[02:25:59.712 --> 02:26:02.514]  And all these people that are saying this at the hospitals,
[02:26:03.231 --> 02:26:05.292]  They're pro-vaccine in general.
[02:26:07.392 --> 02:26:12.333]  And they would be telling you on camera, the data are not in.
[02:26:13.693 --> 02:26:21.415]  This is not something I'm willing to risk my life and limb on, so I'm not taking the shot.
[02:26:23.236 --> 02:26:25.056]  That's what's actually going on.
[02:26:26.476 --> 02:26:28.617]  That's very serious stuff.
[02:26:31.488 --> 02:26:33.449]  So all of this is happening behind the scenes.
[02:26:36.091 --> 02:26:39.274]  The pro-vax movement is fracturing.
[02:26:40.835 --> 02:26:43.177]  Internal warfare and conflict.
[02:26:45.158 --> 02:26:48.821]  Trying to present a unified face, which is failing.
[02:26:50.482 --> 02:26:53.724]  Stopping the vaccination programs.
[02:26:56.346 --> 02:26:58.708]  All of this is going on right in front of your face.
[02:27:01.482 --> 02:27:08.806]  Gives you pause, real pause, not fake pause.
[02:27:08.826 --> 02:27:15.069]  So, I want to say a little bit about the vaccine story of COVID.
[02:27:15.829 --> 02:27:28.936]  You know, in my writing and in my work here on the Wednesdays that I appear, I talk a lot about story, narrative.
[02:27:29.491 --> 02:27:31.211]  Who's selling what story?
[02:27:31.751 --> 02:27:33.532]  What is the story they're selling?
[02:27:34.092 --> 02:27:35.372]  What is the narrative?
[02:27:36.452 --> 02:27:37.312]  Is it credible?
[02:27:38.873 --> 02:27:39.613]  Is it simple?
[02:27:39.693 --> 02:27:40.573]  Is it complicated?
[02:27:40.633 --> 02:27:56.856]  Well, in the COVID vaccine story, the official story, what we're told is that this injection, which is not really a vaccine at all, injection of a piece of RNA is going to
[02:27:58.379 --> 02:28:08.923]  Make the cells of your body manufacture a protein that is similar to a protein in the coronavirus.
[02:28:10.803 --> 02:28:27.169]  And that, therefore, your immune system will suddenly go into action against this similar protein that showed up, and that will prepare it, your immune system, for the real thing, if and when
[02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:30.432]  The real SARS-CoV-2 comes along.
[02:28:31.333 --> 02:28:33.134]  That's kind of the official story.
[02:28:35.856 --> 02:28:38.098]  It's a doozy of a story.
[02:28:38.678 --> 02:28:43.042]  And if you want to read more extensive detail, of course you can.
[02:28:44.343 --> 02:28:47.305]  And it gets more complex and complex as you go.
[02:28:47.925 --> 02:28:53.329]  And eventually what you're left with is, do they really know what they're talking about?
[02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:56.632]  They make it sound so smooth.
[02:28:58.192 --> 02:28:59.113]  So delightful.
[02:28:59.874 --> 02:29:00.674]  So easy.
[02:29:01.935 --> 02:29:04.157]  So they've got it covered.
[02:29:05.398 --> 02:29:06.199]  No problem.
[02:29:06.939 --> 02:29:09.261]  Hey, we know exactly what we're doing.
[02:29:10.222 --> 02:29:10.702]  And they don't.
[02:29:12.704 --> 02:29:13.345]  That's the point.
[02:29:15.526 --> 02:29:22.472]  The story they're selling is manufactured to sound like they've got everything under control.
[02:29:23.593 --> 02:29:23.993]  They don't.
[02:29:24.834 --> 02:29:26.896]  This whole idea that they know
[02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:40.215]  That the injection of this little piece of RNA is going to cause your cells to manufacture this exact protein that they wanted to manufacture.
[02:29:40.635 --> 02:29:47.197]  And then your immune system is going to go zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, and react against that protein.
[02:29:47.677 --> 02:29:50.718]  And then everything is going to quiet down again.
[02:29:51.638 --> 02:29:57.200]  No problem, except that now your immune system will be vigilant and on the alert.
[02:29:57.941 --> 02:29:59.842]  For the real thing, if it comes along.
[02:30:00.863 --> 02:30:04.646]  This is a bunch of, you know, hype.
[02:30:06.167 --> 02:30:12.612]  It's official scientists trying to make things sound credible.
[02:30:14.153 --> 02:30:16.875]  Trying to make their own people sound credible.
[02:30:18.456 --> 02:30:27.203]  In truth, there's a reason why this RNA technology has never been brought to market before.
[02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:30.331]  In any drug or any vaccine ever.
[02:30:31.592 --> 02:30:33.773]  Because past attempts have failed.
[02:30:34.873 --> 02:30:35.994]  Why have they failed?
[02:30:36.714 --> 02:30:45.018]  Because of, quote, adverse reactions in the people who are volunteers in clinical studies.
[02:30:46.279 --> 02:30:48.500]  What adverse reactions?
[02:30:49.481 --> 02:30:56.284]  Basically, autoimmune response.
[02:30:57.341 --> 02:31:01.542]  Which is another way of saying the body attacks itself.
[02:31:03.223 --> 02:31:18.868]  Another way of saying the immune system swings into gear at an exaggerated level and doesn't quiet down and therefore begins to attack the body.
[02:31:19.728 --> 02:31:25.130]  So, as if the body were some sort of foreign invader.
[02:31:27.506 --> 02:31:32.710]  That's why RNA technology has never made it to market before.
[02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:36.874]  But now they're saying, hey, we figured that all out.
[02:31:37.214 --> 02:31:38.655]  It's not a problem anymore.
[02:31:39.476 --> 02:31:44.320]  And be assured that everything is safe and effective about this vaccine.
[02:31:46.261 --> 02:31:56.149]  Yet, nine countries at last count had paused the vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine.
[02:31:57.699 --> 02:31:58.359]  Caused it.
[02:31:58.700 --> 02:31:59.300]  Stopped it.
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:00.981]  Because.
[02:32:01.441 --> 02:32:02.181]  Problems.
[02:32:02.401 --> 02:32:03.202]  Problems.
[02:32:03.382 --> 02:32:04.222]  Problems.
[02:32:05.002 --> 02:32:12.846]  With these finicky human beings that are not reacting according to the game plan.
[02:32:13.827 --> 02:32:16.768]  According to the game plan.
[02:32:18.709 --> 02:32:22.231]  Shot ban in 20 nations, Drudge is running.
[02:32:24.252 --> 02:32:24.632]  That's 20.
[02:32:25.192 --> 02:32:27.193]  Up from 9 the last time I looked.
[02:32:29.189 --> 02:32:32.010]  20.
[02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:32.010]  Does that give you a clue?
[02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:38.811]  Fear is now rampant within the pro-vax community.
[02:32:40.012 --> 02:32:58.136]  While they're meeting and conferring about what to do about what they like to call vaccine hesitancy among the people who have brains enough not to take the vaccine, they're having those meetings
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:03.303]  While 20 countries have paused the vaccine.
[02:33:05.885 --> 02:33:06.966]  Does that add up?
[02:33:07.166 --> 02:33:08.748]  No, of course it doesn't add up.
[02:33:10.709 --> 02:33:13.071]  The war is fracturing, folks.
[02:33:13.771 --> 02:33:15.453]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:33:16.753 --> 02:33:18.395]  Okay, final segment in this hour.
[02:33:18.435 --> 02:33:25.480]  John Rappaport here, InfoWars, talking about the horrendous COVID vaccine.
[02:33:27.276 --> 02:33:35.239]  So now government officials are saying, well, after you get the vaccine, uh, you know, you should still wear a mask.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:39.040]  Oh, wait a minute.
[02:33:40.721 --> 02:33:50.684]  I thought the whole point of the vaccine was, you know, we're going to come out the open, the economy, everything is going to be okay.
[02:33:51.925 --> 02:33:55.546]  Venues packed again, bars, restaurants, everything.
[02:33:56.254 --> 02:33:58.956]  I've got to wear a mask after I get the vaccine.
[02:33:58.996 --> 02:33:59.857]  What are you talking about?
[02:34:01.038 --> 02:34:01.779]  Why is that?
[02:34:01.799 --> 02:34:05.141]  I thought I was immune.
[02:34:06.622 --> 02:34:12.467]  You mean I have to wear a mask so that I don't breathe in the virus coming my way?
[02:34:14.109 --> 02:34:16.250]  Well, uh, we're not sure.
[02:34:16.270 --> 02:34:23.616]  Uh, but... Oh, you mean even after I've gotten the vaccine, maybe I can...
[02:34:26.007 --> 02:34:28.348]  Transmit the virus to somebody else?
[02:34:28.448 --> 02:34:29.429]  Well, it's possible.
[02:34:30.229 --> 02:34:30.829]  We don't know.
[02:34:30.849 --> 02:34:31.970]  We're not sure.
[02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:33.131]  It could be.
[02:34:33.231 --> 02:34:33.951]  Maybe not.
[02:34:34.571 --> 02:34:36.272]  Well, maybe, though.
[02:34:37.153 --> 02:34:43.256]  So after you get the vaccine, you should still social distance, wear a mask.
[02:34:45.297 --> 02:34:47.538]  What was all this vaccination thing about?
[02:34:48.678 --> 02:34:50.119]  I mean, you had the world
[02:34:50.905 --> 02:34:58.109]  Waiting with bated breath to get the vaccine because then freedom was going to break out and this was all going to be over.
[02:34:58.709 --> 02:35:08.274]  And finally the nightmare would end and people would come out of their houses and celebrate and the world would be liberated once more, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:35:08.294 --> 02:35:12.476]  And now you're saying, uh, you know what?
[02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:19.320]  You sound like you're saying, you sound like you're saying that you just want to crush everybody.
[02:35:20.922 --> 02:35:32.375]  And you just have to keep on wearing a mask, maybe forever, for as long as you, the officials, claim we have to wear a mask.
[02:35:33.917 --> 02:35:35.078]  That's the game, right?
[02:35:35.939 --> 02:35:42.186]  And if you say we have to distance or stay indoors or lock down or go bankrupt, commit suicide,
[02:35:42.825 --> 02:35:45.206]  Abuse drugs because of the lockdowns, etc.
[02:35:45.246 --> 02:35:46.427]  Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[02:35:46.827 --> 02:35:50.828]  We transmit the virus or we don't, or we do on Monday, we don't on Tuesday.
[02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:52.949]  You decide, we obey.
[02:35:53.389 --> 02:35:55.250]  That's really the op here, right?
[02:35:55.270 --> 02:36:02.453]  It has nothing to do with the vaccine and the immunity passports after you get the vaccine.
[02:36:02.833 --> 02:36:06.695]  That's just another control deal that you're pulling, right?
[02:36:07.956 --> 02:36:11.257]  More, you got to do this, you got to get the shot and whatever.
[02:36:12.702 --> 02:36:18.306]  And suffer all the effects that are making 20 countries pause the vaccine.
[02:36:19.728 --> 02:36:29.735]  That is, effects like autoimmune reactions, keeling over, going into a coma, dying, those kinds of reactions.
[02:36:30.436 --> 02:36:34.499]  Just because you say so, that we have to do this.
[02:36:36.541 --> 02:36:38.482]  That's really what's going on, right?
[02:36:39.183 --> 02:36:41.845]  And when social media decide
[02:36:42.665 --> 02:36:54.816]  That they're going to censor all information about vaccines that is not, what, certified?
[02:36:55.656 --> 02:36:58.659]  Is not up to community standards?
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:04.124]  What are these, you know, Twitter, Facebook, et cetera, what are they actually saying?
[02:37:05.307 --> 02:37:16.011]  Well, what they're actually saying is that they, social media, are following the directives of the World Health Organization and the CDC.
[02:37:18.732 --> 02:37:20.493]  That's reality.
[02:37:20.633 --> 02:37:21.513]  That's what they're saying.
[02:37:23.014 --> 02:37:31.937]  And that anybody that posts to Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or whatever, they have to follow that reality.
[02:37:34.175 --> 02:37:41.519]  World Health Organization, CDC, government basically, government reality.
[02:37:42.099 --> 02:37:42.559]  I don't know.
[02:37:42.659 --> 02:37:45.601]  I mean, I've lived a long time.
[02:37:45.661 --> 02:38:02.369]  I don't know how long you've lived, but I remember a time when any idiot on the street recognized that simply censoring yourself or being censored because you didn't go along with what government was saying
[02:38:04.733 --> 02:38:06.194]  Was idiotic.
[02:38:07.836 --> 02:38:09.037]  Everybody knew that, right?
[02:38:10.378 --> 02:38:16.222]  You're saying that I'm censored because I'm not going along with what the government says?
[02:38:17.463 --> 02:38:18.224]  Are you crazy?
[02:38:18.244 --> 02:38:24.409]  I mean, there was a time when everybody knew this, but all of a sudden, whoa, no, no, no, not anymore.
[02:38:25.169 --> 02:38:25.850]  All of a sudden.
[02:38:26.397 --> 02:38:30.758]  These powerful corporations on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.
[02:38:30.798 --> 02:38:46.801]  say, well, if your information that you post doesn't go along with the CDC and the World Health Organization directives, government, then we censor you.
[02:38:48.762 --> 02:38:50.502]  You're not allowed to disagree.
[02:38:50.522 --> 02:38:53.122]  Wow.
[02:38:55.083 --> 02:38:55.963]  And there's people
[02:38:56.809 --> 02:39:00.211]  Many people who are actually agreeing with these companies.
[02:39:02.252 --> 02:39:05.694]  How idiotic and insane are they?
[02:39:05.714 --> 02:39:08.195]  Oh, this is a good idea.
[02:39:08.995 --> 02:39:21.061]  Yes, we should censor all information that doesn't follow science laid down by the World Health Organization and the CDC because that's real science.
[02:39:21.141 --> 02:39:22.282]  Well, really?
[02:39:22.442 --> 02:39:23.163]  How do you know that?
[02:39:24.203 --> 02:39:25.804]  How do you know it's real science?
[02:39:27.056 --> 02:39:28.376]  You don't know anything.
[02:39:29.637 --> 02:39:30.357]  That's the truth.
[02:39:30.997 --> 02:39:32.897]  You're just taking people's word for it.
[02:39:33.437 --> 02:39:35.558]  The government says this and you agree.
[02:39:35.578 --> 02:39:42.119]  IQ has dropped by at least 30 points.
[02:39:42.479 --> 02:39:44.259]  Maybe more.
[02:39:44.799 --> 02:39:46.699]  But you don't have to go along with that.
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:53.281]  And as I say, internal warfare is breaking out among the pro-vaccine forces.
[02:39:54.001 --> 02:39:55.281]  That's what we're seeing now.
[02:39:57.270 --> 02:39:58.831]  That is indeed what we're seeing.
[02:39:59.711 --> 02:40:01.152]  Let's see what else I've got here.
[02:40:02.792 --> 02:40:06.174]  Yes, follow the guidelines, etc, etc.
[02:40:07.414 --> 02:40:09.795]  So here's something else which I've covered before.
[02:40:12.937 --> 02:40:25.682]  If you look at the actual history of vaccination and the mortality figures, that is, the official figures on how many deaths are caused by
[02:40:26.255 --> 02:40:28.436]  Infectious childhood diseases.
[02:40:30.036 --> 02:40:43.681]  What you discover is that the mortality dropped precipitously and hugely before the introduction of vaccines or even antibiotics.
[02:40:46.182 --> 02:40:47.142]  That's what you discover.
[02:40:47.603 --> 02:40:49.383]  Not because of vaccines.
[02:40:51.284 --> 02:40:53.145]  And there are numerous sources on this.
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:58.181]  And you can include the rise of the middle class and other factors.
[02:40:58.221 --> 02:40:59.542]  Non-medical factors.
[02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:37.125]  So when you have all these idiots standing up there saying, well, the science shows that, you know, we've curved mortality and all these infectious diseases through the miraculous discovery of vaccines.
[02:41:37.226 --> 02:41:39.868]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:39.888 --> 02:41:40.628]  You haven't.
[02:41:41.129 --> 02:41:41.669]  Not true.
[02:41:41.849 --> 02:41:42.670]  Not the history.
[02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:44.512]  Not the actual history.
[02:41:44.532 --> 02:41:45.392]  You're an idiot.
[02:41:45.813 --> 02:41:46.934]  You don't know the science.
[02:41:49.356 --> 02:41:51.778]  Just following the science, like they say.
[02:41:51.798 --> 02:41:53.239]  That's all.
[02:41:55.871 --> 02:42:18.266]  And then we have, and I've covered this as well, getting back to COVID vaccine again, New York Times, I don't know, four or five months ago, piece during the clinical trials of the three major COVID vaccines, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna.
[02:42:21.388 --> 02:42:25.230]  The revelation, and it was juicy revelation,
[02:42:27.031 --> 02:42:37.253]  That the design of these clinical trials was not set up to prove that the vaccines could prevent serious illness.
[02:42:42.334 --> 02:42:54.217]  The clinical trials were only designed to prove that the vaccine could prevent mild, mild illness such as
[02:42:56.892 --> 02:42:59.634]  Cough or chills and fever.
[02:43:02.997 --> 02:43:04.038]  That's all, folks.
[02:43:05.299 --> 02:43:07.040]  That's all they were designed for.
[02:43:07.561 --> 02:43:09.342]  And that's all at best.
[02:43:10.183 --> 02:43:15.327]  When we're talking effectiveness, that's what these COVID vaccines are designed to do.
[02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:25.796]  Prevent cough or chills and fever, which naturally, you know, cure themselves.
[02:43:26.471 --> 02:43:28.152]  No need for a vaccine.
[02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:30.693]  Okay, we're done.
[02:43:31.393 --> 02:43:32.574]  Final thought here.
[02:43:33.234 --> 02:43:36.176]  Watch how many nations are halting the vaccine.
[02:43:36.296 --> 02:43:37.276]  They know something.
[02:43:37.876 --> 02:43:39.857]  This is a major story.
[02:43:40.798 --> 02:43:41.458]  Talk to you later.
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:50.543]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[02:43:50.843 --> 02:43:54.566]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[02:43:54.707 --> 02:43:56.108]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[02:43:56.368 --> 02:43:56.648]  Okay.
[02:43:57.229 --> 02:43:57.469]  Yeah.
[02:43:58.189 --> 02:44:00.051]  I just, I can justify it.
[02:44:00.732 --> 02:44:04.515]  Look, I mean, I won't justify the things he's gotten wrong, and I don't think he will either.
[02:44:04.955 --> 02:44:08.516]  But, I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[02:44:09.096 --> 02:44:18.838]  And when he was on this podcast, and he talked about how 80% of the people that took the Moderna vaccine had significant side effects, particularly after the second dose, people were like, no f***ing way.
[02:44:19.158 --> 02:44:25.060]  So we played Bill Gates, and I put it on my, because people were saying, you had an anti-vaxxer on your podcast.
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:31.481]  I played the Bill Gates clip where Bill Gates is being interviewed by CBS, and he says it himself.
[02:44:31.841 --> 02:44:41.111]  After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers.
[02:44:41.652 --> 02:44:43.814]  So, are these vaccines safe?
[02:44:44.154 --> 02:44:49.540]  The FDA, not being pressured, will look hard at that.
[02:44:49.700 --> 02:44:54.085]  But the data showed that everybody with a high dose had a side effect.
[02:44:54.676 --> 02:44:59.883]  Yeah, but some of that is not dramatic, where it's just super painful.
[02:44:59.903 --> 02:45:03.769]  But yes, we need to make sure there's not severe side effects.
[02:45:03.829 --> 02:45:10.378]  The FDA, I think, will do a good job of that, despite the pressure.
[02:45:10.618 --> 02:45:13.139]  Just like the nurse was telling us earlier today when we got tested.
[02:45:13.459 --> 02:45:15.120]  She experienced chills, shakes.
[02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:16.360]  And she said all her friends did too.
[02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:17.501]  Yep, all her friends did.
[02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:20.902]  So this is something that Alex was saying and people were denying it.
[02:45:21.362 --> 02:45:30.186]  Also, Alex was talking about how children in Sudan were involuntarily given these polio vaccines and a lot of them got polio.
[02:45:30.626 --> 02:45:31.466]  From the vaccine.
[02:45:31.486 --> 02:45:32.186]  We were like, what?
[02:45:32.526 --> 02:45:35.947]  So then he shows us there's a f***ing AP News report.
[02:45:36.327 --> 02:45:40.888]  An article from AP, Associated Press, that shows this poor little terrified child.
[02:45:41.189 --> 02:45:42.529]  And they're squeezing his mouth open.
[02:45:42.549 --> 02:45:44.729]  They dropped this oral vaccine in his mouth.
[02:45:44.969 --> 02:45:49.811]  And it talked about how many of these kids got polio from this vaccine.
[02:45:50.231 --> 02:45:53.431]  These are things that Alex says that you're not hearing people talk about this.
[02:45:53.451 --> 02:45:56.352]  This is not something that's mainstream discussed.
[02:45:56.592 --> 02:45:58.913]  And it doesn't mean that vaccines are bad.
[02:45:59.113 --> 02:46:00.053]  But this is a fact.
[02:46:03.061 --> 02:46:07.484]  Every listener has to spread this link right now or I'm going to die.
[02:46:17.272 --> 02:46:22.476]  Well, we knew this news was coming, so I'm not pleased to be proven right yet again, but here it is.
[02:46:23.116 --> 02:46:24.538]  I've got CNBC.
[02:46:24.758 --> 02:46:26.139]  I've got CNBC.
[02:46:26.399 --> 02:46:27.760]  I've got the New York Post.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:29.621]  I mean, I've got them all right here.
[02:46:31.043 --> 02:46:32.364]  And they say, oh, guess what?
[02:46:33.131 --> 02:46:34.211]  It's not a pandemic.
[02:46:35.232 --> 02:46:36.172]  It's endemic.
[02:46:36.913 --> 02:46:40.554]  Like when they say, America is racist and white people are inherently bad.
[02:46:41.115 --> 02:46:43.416]  Racism is endemic amongst them.
[02:46:44.336 --> 02:46:48.218]  Which is total racism by the establishment and by the left trying to create a race war.
[02:46:49.038 --> 02:46:55.801]  Martin Luther King was right when he said, you judge people by the character of what they do and the content of their deeds.
[02:46:56.161 --> 02:46:57.362]  You don't do it off what color they are.
[02:46:57.382 --> 02:46:58.542]  But that's what they're saying.
[02:46:58.582 --> 02:46:59.623]  Well, now they're saying,
[02:47:01.001 --> 02:47:01.822]  COVID's endemic.
[02:47:01.902 --> 02:47:07.446]  It's a common cold virus that Bill Gates manipulated and patented so he owns it with Fauci and the UN.
[02:47:08.687 --> 02:47:12.070]  And so the vaccines aren't going to work and it's never going to go away.
[02:47:12.130 --> 02:47:24.020]  And Fauci said last week and Bill Gates said this week that you still won't be able to go outside or go have a job or anything because if one person dies of COVID in New Zealand or the US or the UK, no one can ever go outside again.
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:26.722]  People have always died of the flu and always died of the cold.
[02:47:26.762 --> 02:47:30.605]  And we know they've lied about the numbers from car wrecks and motorcycle wrecks and
[02:47:31.345 --> 02:47:35.847]  People with heart attacks and cancer and the flu and pneumonia.
[02:47:36.027 --> 02:47:37.848]  All of that, they admit, has been put in the column.
[02:47:37.868 --> 02:47:38.448]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:47:38.768 --> 02:47:40.449]  Don't question the science or you'll be censored.
[02:47:40.689 --> 02:47:41.389]  You'll be fired.
[02:47:42.109 --> 02:47:48.912]  And so the very people that cooked this up at Wuhan and launched it and lied to us about the death numbers, saying 4% would die.
[02:47:48.932 --> 02:47:49.892]  It wasn't even 1-tenth of 1%.
[02:47:51.293 --> 02:47:52.574]  We're still supposed to listen to them.
[02:47:52.854 --> 02:47:53.554]  So here's the headline.
[02:47:53.654 --> 02:47:55.535]  Experts say COVID could become endemic.
[02:47:56.434 --> 02:47:57.235]  Hope that means for you.
[02:47:57.255 --> 02:48:00.019]  And it goes on to say, oh, there'll be new versions.
[02:48:00.559 --> 02:48:02.041]  COVID-19, COVID-20, 2021, 2022.
[02:48:03.463 --> 02:48:06.226]  In fact, even major Hollywood producers.
[02:48:07.947 --> 02:48:15.972]  Have movies coming out, like Songbird, about how the lockdown's never going to end, never going to stop, and soon there'll be camps and checkpoints.
[02:48:16.413 --> 02:48:17.393]  But that's just a movie, right?
[02:48:17.453 --> 02:48:26.920]  No, they have the contact tracers in Australia, in the UK, and now in Canada, arresting people that try to walk down the street, beating up women, beating up men, strip searching them.
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:29.481]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:48:29.882 --> 02:48:37.667]  This is the excuse to take over the producers and break the will of the people that voted for Brexit, or voted for Trump, or voted for Bolsonaro.
[02:48:38.766 --> 02:48:42.527]  This is a authoritarian takeover and it's so incredibly criminal.
[02:48:42.727 --> 02:48:44.067]  Here's Bill Gates, CNBC.
[02:48:44.407 --> 02:48:45.507]  Bill Gates on mask.
[02:48:46.047 --> 02:48:50.068]  He goes on to say, if you're vaccinated, you can still transmit.
[02:48:50.848 --> 02:48:51.248]  Really?
[02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.909]  Wow.
[02:48:53.769 --> 02:48:55.109]  So now you can't go out.
[02:48:56.169 --> 02:48:57.970]  I'm not going to stop wearing mask.
[02:48:59.210 --> 02:48:59.410]  See?
[02:49:00.570 --> 02:49:02.571]  Because they're never going to let go of this power grab.
[02:49:03.031 --> 02:49:03.711]  It's a problem.
[02:49:04.713 --> 02:49:04.933]  I think?
[02:49:26.983 --> 02:49:29.864]  All I can tell you is they're coming for our children now.
[02:49:29.984 --> 02:49:34.985]  I've got the articles right here saying now they're going to come and basically give it to school children, the COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:36.526]  What is an experimental vaccine?
[02:49:36.746 --> 02:49:40.067]  And they admit COVID doesn't even affect children and the vaccine's dangerous.
[02:49:40.487 --> 02:49:41.687]  This is so incredibly evil.
[02:49:42.067 --> 02:49:45.848]  So help us at InfoWars stay on air for however long God wants to keep us on air.
[02:49:46.288 --> 02:49:48.289]  And God's going to work through you to decide how long it's going to be.
[02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:49.809]  But I would get your supplements.
[02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:51.450]  I would get you preparing asylums.
[02:49:51.490 --> 02:49:52.410]  I'd get your storable food.
[02:49:52.530 --> 02:49:55.671]  I would get all those things at InfoWarsStore.com while you still can.
[02:49:56.078 --> 02:50:00.379]  And running through March 6th, we have 10% off of storable food and free shipping.
[02:50:00.419 --> 02:50:01.139]  That's a huge deal.
[02:50:01.159 --> 02:50:01.639]  Never do that.
[02:50:01.999 --> 02:50:06.261]  And up to 50% off of supplements and all the rest of the products at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:50:06.281 --> 02:50:08.901]  So store-wide free shipping at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:50:09.421 --> 02:50:12.162]  And a lot more, and it's going to have to end coming up this Saturday.
[02:50:12.482 --> 02:50:13.882]  So please check it out while you still can.
[02:50:13.902 --> 02:50:16.043]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast.
