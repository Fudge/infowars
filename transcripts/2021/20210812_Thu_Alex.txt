[00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:14.485]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:15.685]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:16.025]  Today.
[00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:47.372]  If you want my actual worldview, I believe that we're at war, and that this is a takedown of Western civilization, if not humanity, so that it's an attack on us as humans against... I mean, they're coming after us, they're coming after our children, and they want us dead or sterilized.
[00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:51.175]  And we can argue that they are, but I think it's not a necessarily a nation-state war.
[00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:52.416]  This is a fifth generation
[00:00:53.197 --> 00:00:53.518]  Thank you.
[00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.281]  Do you want us to understand what's going on?
[00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:48.371]  I don't have children in school here.
[00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:50.832]  I have seven nieces and nephews in school here.
[00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:53.774]  I teach self-defense courses to teenagers in this area.
[00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:59.937]  And I want to tell you right now, I've had children tell me, they're scared to be white because of the schools that they go to here.
[00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:00.718]  And that's not okay.
[00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:03.115]  It doesn't matter what your skin color is.
[00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:04.136]  It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:07.538]  We should all love each other, and we should be teaching our children that.
[00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:10.300]  We should not have teachers giving them instructions.
[00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.702]  I'm telling you right now, if you try to force our children to get a vaccine, it'll be 1776 in this town.
[00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:20.604]  And we will take you out of office and we will take our children out of your schools.
[00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:22.025]  And you will know what the consequences are.
[00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.666]  How you're going to make those happen.
[00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:32.272]  And there are more pluses for towns that will stand up and go to prisons for these people, because we love them and we want to protect them.
[00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:34.373]  That's our duty as citizens.
[00:02:34.373 --> 00:02:35.394]  And this is crazy.
[00:02:35.394 --> 00:02:40.998]  I'm just going to say, 25 million people were buried in masks that were spied for by the unmasked.
[00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:42.579]  Because they died from infections.
[00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:47.114]  That they could not handle because they were wearing masks for too long.
[00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:50.577]  25 million people died from wearing masks during the swine flu.
[00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:52.778]  And they were buried by the unmasked.
[00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:53.939]  Because we lived.
[00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.922]  We weren't smart enough not to listen to what the government told us.
[00:02:57.922 --> 00:02:59.183]  You understand?
[00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:07.510]  Why y'all wearing this up here and unconstitutionally making people stand back here, by the way, which is an executive order signed by our governor three weeks ago saying you cannot do that.
[00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.630]  You're breaking the law right now.
[00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:12.104]  I said no government, state, or county facility.
[00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:16.965]  Your county and state facilities are not demanding mass resale floor anymore.
[00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:18.105]  There's an executive order.
[00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:21.106]  So now you're breaking laws, and you're breaking Constitution.
[00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:24.807]  So we're going to have a problem with that here.
[00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.467]  We believe in the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:28.647]  We stand up for it.
[00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:37.249]  We do not need to teach our children that the Constitution is bad, that you're a racist because you're a conservative, that you're a racist because you hold up three fingers.
[00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.449]  This is trash.
[00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:50.856]  This is absolute trash what our children are being taught right now.
[00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:51.616]  Thank you very much.
[00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:53.477]  You have a very blessed day, everybody.
[00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:55.858]  You should take your masks off and liberate yourselves.
[00:03:55.858 --> 00:04:00.740]  All right, I'm going to say things coming up next segment that have to be said.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.522]  The good news is humanity's awakening.
[00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:11.089]  The bad news is the globalists have initiated a new form of warfare on a mass scale that cannot be reversed at this point.
[00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:15.773]  And I'm sorry, mainline universities have now confirmed what all the other research said.
[00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:23.640]  Everyone that's been injected with these vaccines, no matter which type it was, it was all designed by Fauci to have the same effect, will now have prions grow in them until they die.
[00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:24.661]  I don't know.
[00:04:46.363 --> 00:04:49.328]  And so admitting to this will stop the rest of us being murdered.
[00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:51.812]  We're going to have to take care of those that are going to be dead and dying.
[00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:52.733]  Alright?
[00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:53.555]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:55.177]  We've been hit by the equivalent of nuclear war.
[00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:10.122]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:16.067]  With promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:16.527]  It's an amazing deal.
[00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:17.107]  Amazing deal.
[00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:20.030]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.635]  You can get my Keys to Dreams sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:32.280]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.822]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[00:05:34.822 --> 00:05:38.225]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:40.086]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:42.148]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:45.471]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:57.197]  Us getting the word out with Alex's great show and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be attacked.
[00:05:57.197 --> 00:05:57.818]  Beautiful.
[00:05:57.818 --> 00:05:58.978]  You're an example of resistance.
[00:05:58.978 --> 00:05:59.539]  Mike Lindell.
[00:05:59.539 --> 00:05:59.979]  Godspeed.
[00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:24.411]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:29.995]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:44.588]  The top scientist in the world warned in emergency papers filed with the European Union, with the UK government, the Australian government, the US government, that every vaccine they tried to develop
[00:06:45.715 --> 00:07:02.789]  Coronavirus has created horrible autoimmune responses and other serious diseases in the body and that in studies of trying to attack the shell casing of the virus or creating an autoimmune response for that would cause blood clots all throughout the body.
[00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.432]  There are now major studies out backing that up.
[00:07:06.432 --> 00:07:09.654]  We're now seeing open-air guinea-pigging of everyone down to age 12.
[00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:16.469]  Thank God only 23% of Australia was dumb enough to take the injection.
[00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.971]  Saudi Arabia is less than 20%.
[00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:22.172]  India is less than 10%.
[00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:26.114]  China's refused all of our globalist vaccines.
[00:07:26.114 --> 00:07:28.696]  But here in the United States, it's really around 50%.
[00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:37.440]  And more prestigious studies just came out on humans and on animals with these vaccines that aren't vaccines.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.942]  And it shows prion growth throughout all major tissues of the body.
[00:07:42.148 --> 00:07:48.616]  And it shows massive acceleration of aging and is killing the lab animals.
[00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:54.403]  And then you realize that Fauci funded dozens and dozens and dozens of studies.
[00:07:54.403 --> 00:08:01.151]  One was a national initiative for Obama in 2012 with seven universities headed up by the University of Texas Galveston.
[00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:06.257]  And they said, do not develop a human vaccine, proceed with extreme caution.
[00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:16.308]  Almost all the lab animals died within months of prion disease bleeding out in the lungs, brain, heart, liver, and kidneys.
[00:08:16.308 --> 00:08:21.573]  And I just keep repeating that because I've got thousands of things I could cover here, but I am just blown away.
[00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:21.674]  I did.
[00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:32.875]  Three hours of research just this morning, actually reading the new studies that have come out that I've got right here, and I understand it's hard to listen to this show.
[00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.837]  It is extremely hard for me to do this show.
[00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:51.748]  I love fighting the globalists, and I want to try to defend humanity, but I am seriously sickened and freaked out by this, that they've gotten enough fellow humans to go along with this, and that we have already witnessed the slow-kill operation that is equivalent to a nuclear war.
[00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:57.220]  I mean, a nuclear war would kill billions of people in just a few hours.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.421]  And then hundreds of millions, if not billions more from fallout.
[00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:18.424]  But this is a soft kill weapon that affects every person differently and is just absolutely so evil and so well thought out and so premeditated that when you see a big flash on the horizon of a hydrogen bomb going off, you know what that means.
[00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.705]  But with this, because it's a slow kill,
[00:09:23.086 --> 00:09:30.655]  Because it's a soft kill, the people don't know what has hit them.
[00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:34.941]  And then I can read all the Pentagon reports to use silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:39.947]  I can go over all the background of the globalists bragging about this and people that actually cooked all this up saying.
[00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:43.182]  They want to depopulate.
[00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:48.466]  We can look at the fact that in India and in China and many other nations, these shots are banned.
[00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:53.530]  And you ask, why would our own government, why would Western Europe target its people?
[00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.751]  And why would Australia?
[00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:56.032]  Because we're captured by the globalists.
[00:09:56.032 --> 00:10:03.157]  We're run by the same sinister organization, the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, all mergers with the CFR.
[00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:04.758]  It's all the same people at the top.
[00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:09.642]  It's about 30 people that share the Deimos Group and the CFR and the Trilateral Commission.
[00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:15.742]  And the Bilderberg Group, and the WTO, and the WHO, and the, I mean, it's like 30 people.
[00:10:15.742 --> 00:10:17.503]  And then there are minions.
[00:10:17.503 --> 00:10:28.990]  And they all write books saying, we're gonna depopulate, the New Revelation's here, we're gonna cleanse the earth of humans, Wall Street Journal, and then you wonder, when they're killing you, why they're doing it.
[00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.754]  And so it's hard for me to get up here and read to you the things I cover.
[00:10:34.754 --> 00:10:37.416]  I mean, here's just one micro example, and I'll get into all the news.
[00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:59.210]  I have made a big deal about the fact that I learned through lawsuits filed by different conservative Christian and Catholic charities over the years and pro-life groups infiltrating what was going on.
[00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.734]  And so it's completely documented in the last 20 years that babies are kept alive
[00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:14.130]  So they can be harvested at a later date because they want to put it on a private auction market system.
[00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.494]  They have several worldwide, but they admit they have four organs.
[00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:23.278]  You come and you die on a car wreck, they get your organs, they have to be flown out immediately.
[00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:25.520]  A lot of times they lose a lot of the organs.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:33.087]  So if you can abort a baby, keep it alive, sign a form saying it's not human, that you didn't resuscitate, that's a bioethics term for not
[00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:38.754]  Giving somebody mouth-to-mouth or defibrillation to get their heart and lungs going again.
[00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:43.675]  That's a term of art to keep a baby alive but say it's not human.
[00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:45.296]  It's a bioethics decision.
[00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:54.439]  And so there was major heat four years ago on the Democratic Party and the globalists doing this in cities they controlled.
[00:11:54.439 --> 00:11:56.960]  And I went on all these shows and told people.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.882]  So Governor Northam, who used to run one of these departments that harvest the kids on record,
[00:12:03.763 --> 00:12:07.226]  What kind of folks they want in government in Virginia.
[00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.369]  He went on TV show and said, yeah, we don't get the state involved with the police.
[00:12:10.369 --> 00:12:11.030]  No, no.
[00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.872]  It's between the doctors and the mother.
[00:12:13.872 --> 00:12:18.957]  And we decide if she wants the baby and if she doesn't, we do not resuscitate.
[00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:20.438]  Doesn't mean the child's dead.
[00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:25.303]  And then we keep the baby comfortable.
[00:12:25.303 --> 00:12:27.965]  And they have wards and I've talked to nurses that work in them.
[00:12:27.965 --> 00:12:28.806]  I have the literature.
[00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:30.047]  I have the, all of it.
[00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:37.791]  And they talk about how they keep the babies alive in these special wings, special locked up facilities.
[00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:40.673]  And the nurses that work in there are paid double or triple.
[00:12:40.673 --> 00:12:43.736]  Some of these nurses are paid $200,000 a year.
[00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.399]  The doctors that do this are making up to $2 million a year.
[00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:52.545]  Because this is seriously illegal stuff, okay?
[00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:54.427]  I was telling a distant family member,
[00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:59.730]  Who is a nurse at the VA about this.
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.030]  She said, well, what's wrong with that?
[00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.572]  I mean, we keep people alive that are brain dead for harvesting until we can get the surgery line up.
[00:13:06.572 --> 00:13:07.032]  I said, oh, really?
[00:13:07.032 --> 00:13:07.272]  How long?
[00:13:07.272 --> 00:13:08.712]  She goes, sometimes a week or two.
[00:13:08.712 --> 00:13:10.173]  She goes, oh, tell me about that.
[00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:10.493]  Oopsie.
[00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.490]  I go, oh, it's a special wing.
[00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.832]  You put a plastic oxygen tent over them, don't you?
[00:13:20.832 --> 00:13:22.734]  She goes, how do you know that?
[00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:24.135]  I said, it's all these weird protocols.
[00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:25.856]  Like, oh, this is no longer human.
[00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:31.441]  We put a plastic black bag over them, but oxygenate it, get it all ready and good until we're ready.
[00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:33.382]  And see, you can say, well, that's to save the organs.
[00:13:33.382 --> 00:13:36.405]  But it's becoming a commodity, beyond a commodity.
[00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:40.348]  And here's Fox News, here's Associated Press, today.
[00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:48.286]  Criminal investigation by the Justice Department of whether major universities got delivery of live babies.
[00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:59.415]  Well, it's in the frickin' contract that they deliver third term, seven, eight, nine month, and even past born children are taken out of the vagina.
[00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:04.238]  These are poor women sometimes that show up at the hospital and they got the baby.
[00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:08.382]  I mean, they're killing babies that show up at the hospital.
[00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:09.042]  Comprende?
[00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:11.184]  Oh, and you know what else was in the documents?
[00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:17.047]  They actually put in a bunch of contracts that they wanted minority babies.
[00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:20.117]  They don't say why in California and Ohio and New York.
[00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:26.807]  And Illinois says right here in the article, we want black and brown babies.
[00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:29.627]  Oh, but if I say the wrong thing, I'm a racist white man.
[00:14:29.627 --> 00:14:37.949]  But if the state and these companies are killing and targeting black babies for harvesting, that's all right.
[00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:43.090]  You're not going to hear a damn word out of Black Lives Matter about that, because that's their main goal.
[00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:49.051]  And the former head of Planned Parenthood is this Chinese woman on TV talking about how we need to help the kids and get them the shots.
[00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.508]  So again, I'm going to explain something to you.
[00:14:52.508 --> 00:15:06.925]  The major national gay pride organization just gave their highest award to an image of a toddler child with men in bondage uniforms with sex swings that they put themselves in and have sex with other men in.
[00:15:06.925 --> 00:15:08.306]  That's what men are doing.
[00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:09.307]  That's their issue.
[00:15:09.307 --> 00:15:11.290]  This is with a two-year-old child.
[00:15:13.885 --> 00:15:21.252]  And they're all lined up, basically standing around the child, and the message is, we're about to gangbang this two-year-old.
[00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:24.355]  Now, I don't want to show you the photo, but we're going to show it today.
[00:15:24.355 --> 00:15:32.083]  They're not naked, but that's what this is, bondage and BDSM and all this crap.
[00:15:32.083 --> 00:15:38.189]  But you see, understand, they're keeping babies alive, they got toddlers in celebration photos, they're coming for you.
[00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:40.348]  They're carnivores.
[00:15:40.348 --> 00:15:41.808]  They're demons.
[00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:43.869]  They are, what do you want to call them?
[00:15:43.869 --> 00:15:45.250]  They are psychotics.
[00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:50.832]  The whole system is about predatory cannibalism against humanity.
[00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:51.072]  Alright?
[00:15:51.072 --> 00:15:53.073]  So just understand that.
[00:15:53.073 --> 00:15:53.894]  And they've already killed
[00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:58.485]  Half the country's gonna die now, very slowly, very painfully.
[00:15:58.485 --> 00:15:59.525]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:07.932]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:08.953]  Here's why.
[00:16:08.953 --> 00:16:12.256]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:17.977]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:26.980]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:34.962]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:41.759]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:45.600]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.601]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:56.002]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[00:16:56.002 --> 00:16:58.363]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:16:59.849]  Hey everybody.
[00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:05.355]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:07.797]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:08.638]  Here's the thing.
[00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:12.943]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[00:17:12.943 --> 00:17:13.904]  Survival soup beans.
[00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:22.474]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:23.576]  The best part?
[00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:32.627]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[00:17:32.867 --> 00:17:33.888]  Gets even better!
[00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:44.654]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[00:17:44.654 --> 00:17:45.474]  Period.
[00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:47.495]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:47.495 --> 00:17:49.656]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:53.739]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.620]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.501]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:03.965]  The biosecurity state is here.
[00:18:03.965 --> 00:18:09.887]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[00:18:09.887 --> 00:18:23.631]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:28.314]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[00:18:28.314 --> 00:18:32.318]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[00:18:32.318 --> 00:18:34.099]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:36.201]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:39.024]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:41.586]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:51.175]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:18:51.855 --> 00:18:53.796]  InfoWars will continue to set us up as we fight this.
[00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:55.277]  I don't know how long we can.
[00:18:55.277 --> 00:18:56.658]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[00:18:56.658 --> 00:18:58.279]  God bless and good luck.
[00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:01.081]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:06.344]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Super Sale.
[00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:12.168]  And we have the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium, 50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:16.210]  Vitamin C, Zinc, and Rosehips, very strong formula.
[00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.771]  This is 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:19.232 --> 00:19:21.773]  Now back in stock, just came back in yesterday.
[00:19:21.773 --> 00:19:25.094]  Very powerful, pure turmeric extract tincture.
[00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:28.975]  Not a sheer immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:32.436]  And then, sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:19:32.436 --> 00:19:36.077]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint.
[00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:40.539]  And so much more, back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash.
[00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:48.516 --> 00:21:03.625]  We are witnessing all over the world young people, 12-year-olds and some even younger, in experiments being forced by their parents to take an experimental shot.
[00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:12.371]  And you have to ask yourself, how far are we going to let these globalists take us?
[00:21:15.782 --> 00:21:17.643]  These young people aren't just scared of needles.
[00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.144]  They know.
[00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.765]  They instinctively understand.
[00:21:20.765 --> 00:21:25.509]  She is about to be implanted with prions.
[00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:28.070]  Mad cow disease, basically.
[00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.751]  She is being targeted for destruction.
[00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:33.234]  Her young, beautiful life, now slowly mutated.
[00:21:33.234 --> 00:21:38.978]  Not gonna be having children, sweetheart.
[00:21:38.978 --> 00:21:40.659]  You'll probably die when you're 40 now, if you're lucky.
[00:21:41.943 --> 00:21:44.104]  Bye-bye, it's time, Bill Gates said.
[00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:48.545]  Too many people, sweetheart.
[00:21:48.545 --> 00:21:50.526]  No, I know you wanted to live.
[00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:51.646]  I know you wanted to have children.
[00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:57.368]  Please, no, she doesn't want it, but she's gonna get it.
[00:21:57.368 --> 00:21:59.108]  Because they're the heroes.
[00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:03.750]  They're Dr. Mingala.
[00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:09.732]  Doesn't matter in all the studies that mutated and hurt the rats and shut their kidneys down and their livers and their hearts and their brains.
[00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:11.826]  Mommy's good.
[00:22:11.826 --> 00:22:15.248]  Mommy's gonna make her young, beautiful young daughter take it.
[00:22:15.248 --> 00:22:15.888]  There you go.
[00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:18.290]  The unapproved shot.
[00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.011]  GMO.
[00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:20.992]  There you go.
[00:22:20.992 --> 00:22:23.773]  Mommy's gonna kiss you now.
[00:22:23.773 --> 00:22:31.358]  And even if you get really sick from the first shot, she's gonna take you in and give you more shots.
[00:22:31.358 --> 00:22:36.842]  Just like the reporter in Australia took the first shot and got really sick.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:45.447]  She said, but I went and took the second one and now she's got in the hospital and a swollen heart and might die.
[00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.128]  But she said, I'll do it again.
[00:22:47.128 --> 00:22:52.052]  I'm a hero for something that didn't kill as many people as the flu.
[00:22:52.052 --> 00:23:01.421]  But now there are hospitals full of people, mainly the vaccinated, 95% of the average worldwide that are in the hospital, including countries like Australia that are
[00:23:04.156 --> 00:23:09.699]  27% vaccinated, but 99.9% of those in the hospital have had the injection.
[00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:12.140]  That's on State Run TV!
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.601]  They even admit it!
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.042]  It's the murder of logic!
[00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:21.965]  And they had one case, one new case, in one city in Australia, so they brought the army in and locked it back down.
[00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:28.588]  I played this at the very start of the show, but I'm going to play it again because it illustrates everything.
[00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:29.589]  This is Medical Doctor.
[00:23:30.899 --> 00:23:34.581]  Dr. Lee Merritt, who does a great job explaining what this is.
[00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:36.102]  Here she is.
[00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:50.431]  If you want my actual worldview, I believe that we're at war and that this is a takedown of Western civilization, if not humanity, so that it's an attack on us as humans against... I mean, they're coming after us, they're coming after our children, and they want us dead or sterilized.
[00:23:50.431 --> 00:23:54.234]  And we can argue that they are, but I think it's not necessarily a nation-state war.
[00:23:54.234 --> 00:23:55.475]  This is a fifth generation
[00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:56.576]  Thank you.
[00:24:13.496 --> 00:24:16.538]  You're using poisons, you're using genetic agents.
[00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:21.581]  It's not characteristic warfare where you have a battlefield and you have an army and we can see what's going on.
[00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:23.682]  Part of this is the psychological operation.
[00:24:23.682 --> 00:24:31.826]  There's clearly been a psychological operation that has gotten the American people are getting their children vaccinated with something that's totally experimental.
[00:24:31.826 --> 00:24:35.088]  That's a symptom of some psychological illness.
[00:24:35.088 --> 00:24:36.309]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:37.589]  They created this.
[00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:40.591]  And so I think that's my worldview is that this is not by accident.
[00:24:40.591 --> 00:24:42.052]  And they want us dead or sterilized.
[00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:49.822]  All right, now, let's go ahead, because everything she's saying is 100% true.
[00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:50.642]  She's a medical doctor.
[00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:52.523]  We can put a screenshot back up, please.
[00:24:52.523 --> 00:25:00.724]  She is the past president of one of the major national medical associations of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[00:25:00.724 --> 00:25:02.565]  That was with Mike Adams in June.
[00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:03.885]  He's going to be co-hosting later today.
[00:25:03.885 --> 00:25:08.406]  I hope you'll get her on the show or give us her contact info, because I really have been wanting
[00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:13.369]  This virus is a man-made gain-of-function virus paid for by U.S.
[00:25:13.369 --> 00:25:16.711]  taxpayers' dollars, including monies that came from the Department of Defense.
[00:25:34.417 --> 00:25:38.540]  This is a bioweapon, by every definition.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:45.765]  And by every definition, their having developed this is a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty.
[00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:55.171]  Dr. Mengele, right now, is rolling over in his grave, wondering why he could not have the capacity to do this type of human manipulation.
[00:25:55.171 --> 00:25:58.733]  And right now, right now, this vaccine rollout,
[00:25:59.674 --> 00:26:04.455]  This is the largest research project conducted in the history of mankind.
[00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:09.116]  You are either part of the experimental group or part of the control group.
[00:26:09.116 --> 00:26:23.178]  For anybody to be forcing or coercing anybody to take this vaccine, when if you look at the numbers on these vaccines, they do not statistically reduce your risk of coming down with a diagnosis of COVID or killing you.
[00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:26.219]  When you go through the EUA documents, you will find
[00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:38.805]  That those are the people who do not get diagnosed and there is no statistically significant difference for the people who got the Pfizer vaccine versus people who didn't get vaccinated at seven days.
[00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:56.233]  For the people who got the Moderna vaccine and who didn't at 14 days and for the Janssen group at seven or at 14 days there was a slight difference but by 28 days that difference was gone and there's no difference in deaths and in fact the Janssen data is based upon the incorrect data
[00:26:56.673 --> 00:27:05.719]  If you read through the EUA, because if you go to the following table, you will find out that the numbers that they use to get approval are not the centrally confirmed lab numbers.
[00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:13.325]  They use the peripheral labs, but those numbers were not confirmed by the central core lab, which is what you do when you have a research project.
[00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:16.547]  A central place that says yes, no.
[00:27:16.547 --> 00:27:21.751]  The central core numbers don't even show benefit at 14 days.
[00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:23.332]  This is a biological weapon.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:31.246]  That's right, it's a biological covert weapon because if the globalists launch nuclear bombs on us, we would know who launched the nuclear missiles.
[00:27:31.246 --> 00:27:33.749]  But if they do it under the guise of a vaccine, they win.
[00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:47.273]  And that's why they're so desperate and so pissed and are pushing as hard as they can to get everybody to take it because Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the United States and Canada are the globalist targets.
[00:27:47.273 --> 00:27:52.736]  We're the open free societies that have the private property and the Christian ethos that won't fit into the New World Order.
[00:27:52.736 --> 00:28:01.081]  So they want to massively poison and depopulate the middle class, suck all of its money out, and then bring in other populations to replace it.
[00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:07.735]  And that's why all over the place there are just massive, massive convulsions and deaths happening.
[00:28:07.735 --> 00:28:11.396]  But that's because the weapon's so strong, it's killing people up front.
[00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:14.257]  It's not meant to.
[00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:15.778]  It's meant to kill you slowly.
[00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:17.418]  In the young, it's going to take years.
[00:28:17.418 --> 00:28:19.178]  There are studies out now.
[00:28:19.178 --> 00:28:21.639]  It's going to take years for the prions to grow in the young.
[00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:23.059]  Five, ten years.
[00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:25.260]  But they just keep growing like plants in dirt.
[00:28:27.022 --> 00:28:28.863]  Very similar to anthrax.
[00:28:28.863 --> 00:28:30.224]  And then they will kill you.
[00:28:30.224 --> 00:28:32.446]  And they're just not going to say it was the shot.
[00:28:32.446 --> 00:28:41.052]  But in the old folks, humans already kind of, don't kind of, we grow all sorts of weird prions that we eat and things that are in the environment already.
[00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:45.055]  So by the time you're very old, it's very easy to get a prion infestation.
[00:28:45.055 --> 00:28:47.017]  If more is added, they'll grow on each other.
[00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:55.483]  And that's why in the old people, it's just devastating, quickly killing them, very fast hemorrhaging out because they were already ready, like with fertilizer basically, for the prions to grow.
[00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:56.364]  So they're killing us, folks.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.340]  Hey, everybody.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.562]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:29:03.562 --> 00:29:04.323]  Me too.
[00:29:04.323 --> 00:29:11.447]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:29:11.447 --> 00:29:15.829]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:17.730]  You probably already believe that.
[00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.751]  I certainly do.
[00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:19.691]  So here's the thing.
[00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:28.016]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:33.997]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:29:33.997 --> 00:29:35.358]  No cures or treatments there.
[00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:44.580]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.480]  And the best part?
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:52.202]  You can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.
[00:29:52.202 --> 00:29:53.042]  Crazy, right?
[00:29:53.042 --> 00:29:56.703]  Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at StrongerDefense.com
[00:29:57.323 --> 00:30:12.347]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[00:30:12.347 --> 00:30:15.528]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked
[00:30:16.288 --> 00:30:16.869]  Pretty good.
[00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:18.692]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with F2.
[00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:22.918]  You had, you know, with a deep word source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[00:30:22.918 --> 00:30:29.247]  And, man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened.
[00:30:29.247 --> 00:30:30.689]  You know, I could think again.
[00:30:30.689 --> 00:30:32.412]  I could connect with people again.
[00:30:32.512 --> 00:30:38.874]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[00:30:38.874 --> 00:30:41.255]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[00:30:41.255 --> 00:30:43.156]  The one I liked recently is Knockout.
[00:30:43.156 --> 00:30:45.376]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.117]  It's amazing.
[00:30:46.117 --> 00:30:46.637]  It works.
[00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:49.198]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[00:30:49.198 --> 00:30:55.380]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.660]  Beautifully said, brother.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.501]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[00:31:00.296 --> 00:31:08.442]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six-plus months of, where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash?
[00:31:08.442 --> 00:31:16.568]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a bestseller within six months, and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns of the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[00:31:16.568 --> 00:31:19.771]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply.
[00:31:19.771 --> 00:31:20.792]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:22.713]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the Infowar.
[00:31:22.713 --> 00:31:25.936]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you're already a fan or you haven't tried it,
[00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:29.359]  It's back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:35.824]  Discounted because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[00:31:35.824 --> 00:31:41.629]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places.
[00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:46.774]  InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:49.817]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:58.165]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with essential oils and more at InfoWarStore.com and fund the InfoWar.
[00:31:58.165 --> 00:32:00.207]  A true 360 win.
[00:32:00.207 --> 00:32:07.154]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:32:07.734 --> 00:32:13.237]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[00:32:13.237 --> 00:32:21.100]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.581]  Humanity is strong.
[00:32:22.581 --> 00:32:23.541]  We're incredible.
[00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:27.323]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:32:27.323 --> 00:32:29.784]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:32:29.784 --> 00:32:35.707]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:32:36.107 --> 00:32:45.794]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[00:32:45.794 --> 00:32:48.095]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:48.095 --> 00:32:50.777]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[00:32:50.777 --> 00:32:56.101]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[00:32:56.101 --> 00:33:00.064]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:33:03.494 --> 00:33:06.128]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:40.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:40.457 --> 00:33:45.619]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:45.619 --> 00:34:01.086]  It's one thing to march tribs by the tens of thousands, within a mile, two miles of an atomic bomb going off, or five miles of a hydrogen bomb.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.307]  It's one thing to use men as guinea pigs.
[00:34:05.307 --> 00:34:06.708]  It's illegal, it's wrong, it's evil.
[00:34:08.677 --> 00:34:14.682]  But we saw massive testing done in the Gulf War and then again later with anthrax on the troops.
[00:34:14.682 --> 00:34:22.088]  It's estimated more than 40,000 ended up dying in mainline government reports from the injections they were given.
[00:34:22.088 --> 00:34:30.255]  And then all they did was dust them off, the radioactive dust, but almost all of them ended up getting lung cancer and dying within just a few years.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:42.122]  And now they're doing it to our children with a so-called vaccine that grows prions, grows crystals in all the lab studies in all the animals.
[00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:43.842]  People go, wait a minute, I thought you said it's not studied.
[00:34:43.842 --> 00:34:50.303]  Oh, they massively studied these exact type of vaccines, these injections, under other names in lab animals.
[00:34:50.303 --> 00:34:52.344]  Fauci was obsessed.
[00:34:52.344 --> 00:34:54.684]  His main project for 20 years.
[00:34:54.684 --> 00:34:59.305]  And they finally came up with a specific protein type
[00:35:01.047 --> 00:35:20.172]  A virus that they tested on animals and humans in China, that when you give somebody a vaccine for this and the body then starts mass producing the spike proteins, it permanently poisons the body and then colonizes the body and turns the body into an engine to grow it.
[00:35:20.172 --> 00:35:25.573]  So I'm all in now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:25.573 --> 00:35:29.694]  These people are coming after our children.
[00:35:31.049 --> 00:35:39.531]  They're doing medical experiments on babies kept alive after they're born.
[00:35:39.531 --> 00:35:41.511]  And it's even in the news.
[00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:44.872]  And they're not going to jail, they're not getting in trouble.
[00:35:44.872 --> 00:35:49.932]  Well, it's coming to the point when we're at salt of this level, we have to discuss what are we gonna do about it.
[00:35:49.932 --> 00:35:56.594]  So I'm gonna go ahead and just show TV viewers a photo of my four-year-old daughter here on my phone.
[00:35:56.594 --> 00:35:57.894]  She's such a beautiful little angel.
[00:35:59.326 --> 00:36:09.951]  And the globalists want her to grow up in a world where she has to take dangerous poison injections to kill lab rats and ferrets and dogs and pigs.
[00:36:09.951 --> 00:36:23.098]  Those are supposed to grow in her for a few years, and she has a sickening, agonizing life, and so she's sterile, and so she finally dies after paying out our family's money and any money she ever earned if she lived long enough to them.
[00:36:23.098 --> 00:36:26.900]  This is next-level slavery, trying to colonize her body with these prions.
[00:36:28.032 --> 00:36:29.013]  Here's really the bad news.
[00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:31.915]  It's confirmed in all the studies.
[00:36:31.915 --> 00:36:35.659]  I'm not happy about this.
[00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:49.091]  Even if you don't take these inoculations, individuals are everywhere now sloughing off these spike proteins en masse that are basically self-replicating micro-crystals that grow in your body.
[00:36:50.151 --> 00:36:53.134]  And so I could call people I know that work in hospitals around the country.
[00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:54.135]  I could check statistics.
[00:36:54.135 --> 00:36:55.577]  I could send reporters out.
[00:36:55.577 --> 00:36:58.960]  And last year at this time, the hospitals were empty.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.444]  They wouldn't do all the real care they needed, so there was a lot of death from cancers and heart attacks.
[00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:03.345]  But they were empty.
[00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:07.849]  They were paying the hospitals not to operate.
[00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:08.170]  And then...
[00:37:11.072 --> 00:37:14.573]  Hey guys, you guys are sending Mike Adams over my earpiece.
[00:37:14.573 --> 00:37:16.794]  I'd really appreciate it if you cut that off.
[00:37:16.794 --> 00:37:18.174]  That'd be really awesome.
[00:37:18.174 --> 00:37:19.154]  It's been happening for a while.
[00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:22.935]  I was going to ignore it, but just if you'll, I guess you're getting ready for the show later today.
[00:37:22.935 --> 00:37:25.356]  That'd be awesome if it actually got turned off.
[00:37:25.356 --> 00:37:26.136]  Thanks.
[00:37:26.136 --> 00:37:29.677]  So, um, try to get back to my daughter, please.
[00:37:29.677 --> 00:37:31.958]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:33.879]  I just, I'm very emotional about all this.
[00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:38.480]  I'm going to very important points I need to make, and I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:56.474]  It's very hard to sit up here on air and have literal thousands of documents, total admission, open and shut, like I've been saying the last few weeks.
[00:37:56.474 --> 00:38:03.296]  You pour a gallon of gasoline on somebody, you light them on fire, they're going to burn to death.
[00:38:03.296 --> 00:38:08.578]  This is all open and shut.
[00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:11.699]  Okay?
[00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:15.800]  And now, they are
[00:38:17.042 --> 00:38:33.446]  Coming for my daughter and your children and everyone else to literally colonize them and poison them and take control of their lives and then you learn that they've been studying it and preparing it for decades and now they've done it to us.
[00:38:33.446 --> 00:38:39.008]  And now they want to forcibly inject all the children in the Western world and literally get rid of us.
[00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:43.900]  And they're telling the world white people are inherently bad.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:53.303]  And it just so happens to be the countries where there are white people, 7% of the world's population that live, that are being targeted for extermination.
[00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:56.584]  But it's also the black people and the brown people being targeted as well.
[00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:58.264]  But they won't take the shots in Africa.
[00:38:58.264 --> 00:38:59.644]  They won't take the shots in India.
[00:38:59.644 --> 00:39:00.365]  They're smart.
[00:39:00.365 --> 00:39:01.165]  They've already been through this.
[00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:08.790]  And they are targeting, in the federal documents, Fox News, minority babies for the organ harvesting.
[00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.591]  I didn't even know they were targeting minority babies.
[00:39:10.591 --> 00:39:12.471]  I just knew it was babies.
[00:39:12.471 --> 00:39:14.292]  Keeping them alive.
[00:39:14.292 --> 00:39:20.555]  Do you understand that if your neighbor got caught doing this, they go to a Supermax prison?
[00:39:20.555 --> 00:39:26.038]  But Fauci is involved with Governor Northam in the harvesting of babies' organs after they're born?
[00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:28.599]  Do you understand that's in the news?
[00:39:32.116 --> 00:39:45.805]  And the good news is we pushed really hard and finally got this out, but doctors say, pit statements point to possibility organs extracted from living fetuses, school denies charge.
[00:39:45.805 --> 00:39:48.526]  Well, what do you mean the school denies the charge?
[00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:50.608]  That's just one of many schools, colleges.
[00:39:50.608 --> 00:39:52.109]  It's in the purchase order.
[00:39:53.786 --> 00:40:00.390]  That the quote, fetuses be delivered whole, heart still beating.
[00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.632]  First they say it's not a human in the womb.
[00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:12.459]  So now they're going to tear it out of the womb, or take it out of the woman, call it a fetus and say deliver it with its heart not beating.
[00:40:12.459 --> 00:40:14.080]  And the lawyers at these universities are like,
[00:40:15.014 --> 00:40:17.415]  Well, we don't count it as a human.
[00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.275]  We're the bioethics board.
[00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:24.337]  Pop Peter Singer, that helped found PETA and runs all this, has nothing to do with animal rights.
[00:40:24.337 --> 00:40:25.678]  It's about control.
[00:40:25.678 --> 00:40:29.979]  He said parents should be able to kill children up to age 3.
[00:40:29.979 --> 00:40:33.680]  And we should just be able to have the state get rid of people at 75.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.642]  And that's why Rahm Emanuel says everyone should be forced to die at 75.
[00:40:39.718 --> 00:40:41.279]  Well, he's almost 75.
[00:40:41.279 --> 00:40:43.181]  Let me guess, he's not going to kill himself.
[00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:48.545]  Do you understand this is a psychotic legion of doom on record?
[00:40:48.545 --> 00:40:52.348]  Do you understand I don't want to go up against these people?
[00:40:52.348 --> 00:40:53.990]  These are killers!
[00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.391]  I'm not making any of this up.
[00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:57.973]  I wish this wasn't true!
[00:40:57.973 --> 00:41:08.462]  The whole world freaked out when I have a giant audience and showed you documents obtained by Christian lawyers across the world
[00:41:10.913 --> 00:41:14.715]  Where they take already born babies and do medical experiments on them.
[00:41:14.715 --> 00:41:16.015]  And then kill them.
[00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:18.956]  And harvest them like they're a pig that got butchered.
[00:41:18.956 --> 00:41:23.178]  Or a cow.
[00:41:23.178 --> 00:41:25.559]  We're not going into New World Order.
[00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.080]  We're not about to be slaves.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.700]  We are.
[00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:45.120]  And now they've decided they don't need most of us, so they're injecting people with a deadly protein crystal that orders your cells to produce a protein virus crystal that colonizes and eats your body slowly.
[00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:48.311]  Of course it would be something like that.
[00:41:48.311 --> 00:41:51.932]  Too nice to just fly over with helicopters and nerve gases.
[00:41:51.932 --> 00:41:56.233]  That would cause fires and explosions and people would still survive and organize against it.
[00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:57.673]  No, they had no choice.
[00:41:57.673 --> 00:42:05.335]  But if it is a covert attack, people want to rationalize.
[00:42:05.335 --> 00:42:07.395]  They don't want to believe it's happening.
[00:42:07.395 --> 00:42:10.636]  They don't want to believe it's taking place in their lifetime.
[00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:12.056]  It is.
[00:42:12.056 --> 00:42:12.596]  It's happened.
[00:42:18.939 --> 00:42:21.001]  I'm going to calm down and try to come back and say what I was going to say earlier.
[00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:21.782]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[00:42:21.782 --> 00:42:27.748]  There's all sorts of equipment in there, and they were checking a guest, and the audio came through, and I forgot what I was going to say, so I got mad.
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:28.809]  I tried to ignore it for a while.
[00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:30.090]  I just thought it would stop after a while.
[00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.011]  It didn't.
[00:42:31.011 --> 00:42:34.834]  I'm going to try to reset.
[00:42:34.834 --> 00:42:37.477]  I'm going to try to come back and hit all these clips and all this news, and then...
[00:42:41.414 --> 00:42:43.915]  I've got a bunch of these documents, which I didn't cover last week.
[00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:44.536]  I said I would.
[00:42:44.536 --> 00:42:45.836]  I don't want to read this on air.
[00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:50.358]  Do you want to hear about them keeping the little kids alive and sucking all their blood and harvesting them?
[00:42:50.358 --> 00:42:51.779]  Because, I mean, you talk about vampires.
[00:42:51.779 --> 00:42:53.160]  That's what this is.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.840]  It's just done medically.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.361]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:55.361 --> 00:42:55.741]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.684 --> 00:43:04.927]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:08.450]  And we have the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium.
[00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.751]  50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[00:43:10.751 --> 00:43:13.373]  Vitamin C, Zinc, and Rosehips.
[00:43:13.373 --> 00:43:14.814]  Very strong formula.
[00:43:14.814 --> 00:43:17.516]  This is 50% off at Infolwerestore.com.
[00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:20.379]  Now back in stock, just came back in yesterday.
[00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:22.962]  Very powerful, pure turmeric extract.
[00:43:22.962 --> 00:43:27.587]  Takes your, not just your immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[00:43:27.587 --> 00:43:31.051]  And then, sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:43:31.051 --> 00:43:34.675]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint.
[00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:39.160]  And so much more, back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:39.680]  I think so.
[00:44:00.649 --> 00:44:02.411]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:02.892]  You're on the air.
[00:44:02.892 --> 00:44:03.433]  Thanks for holding.
[00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:03.953]  Yeah, hello.
[00:44:03.953 --> 00:44:04.494]  Can you hear me?
[00:44:04.494 --> 00:44:05.135]  I sure can, sir.
[00:44:05.135 --> 00:44:05.455]  Thank you.
[00:44:05.455 --> 00:44:06.236]  Hey, Alex.
[00:44:06.236 --> 00:44:12.444]  Before I start, man, I just... I've been wanting to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:13.786]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:44:13.786 --> 00:44:15.809]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and...
[00:44:16.449 --> 00:44:17.890]  I just want to plug in.
[00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:22.314]  I'm a truck driver and turbo force has changed the way I drive.
[00:44:22.314 --> 00:44:28.959]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:37.005]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[00:44:37.085 --> 00:44:43.369]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:44:43.369 --> 00:44:45.671]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:44:45.671 --> 00:44:50.794]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:44:50.794 --> 00:44:54.817]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:44:54.817 --> 00:44:57.359]  And you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:57.699]  Thank you.
[00:44:57.699 --> 00:44:59.140]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[00:45:00.933 --> 00:45:10.205]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[00:45:10.205 --> 00:45:16.373]  And with promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[00:45:16.373 --> 00:45:16.814]  It's an amazing deal.
[00:45:16.854 --> 00:45:17.274]  Amazing deal.
[00:45:17.274 --> 00:45:20.195]  You get my six pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:26.797]  You can get my Geezer Dream Sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[00:45:26.797 --> 00:45:32.458]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:34.999]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:38.380]  I just lost a million dollar a week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.260]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.301]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:45.622]  Your best special is using the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[00:45:46.002 --> 00:45:48.945]  You're an example of resistance.
[00:45:48.945 --> 00:45:49.806]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[00:46:00.879 --> 00:46:07.821]  BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[00:46:07.821 --> 00:46:14.644]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[00:46:14.644 --> 00:46:21.646]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:26.208]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[00:46:26.468 --> 00:46:28.410]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.033]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:32.875]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:35.417]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:39.702]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:47.029]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times
[00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:48.670]  We're good to go.
[00:47:25.629 --> 00:47:29.115]  Defending humanity from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:29.115 --> 00:47:31.239]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:38.751]  So, they're coming after our children, they're coming after their very life, they're coming after their fertility, they're coming after their very cells.
[00:47:39.943 --> 00:47:45.628]  With a injection they now admit does not protect you, not just from regular COVID or the Delta variant.
[00:47:45.628 --> 00:47:46.589]  It's all made up crap.
[00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:48.170]  It never protected anything.
[00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:54.375]  That's why all the top scientists, I mean, almost all the real scientists, the most prestigious said, this doesn't protect against a virus.
[00:47:54.375 --> 00:47:55.756]  It makes you grow it.
[00:47:55.756 --> 00:47:57.097]  What are you doing?
[00:47:57.097 --> 00:47:57.918]  There's never been one.
[00:47:59.306 --> 00:48:03.349]  For a cold virus, it'll work because it always causes autoimmune disease.
[00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:06.471]  And this is the very worst of all that knowledge.
[00:48:06.471 --> 00:48:09.032]  This is what you would do to hurt somebody.
[00:48:09.032 --> 00:48:12.134]  Remember a year ago before the vaccine rolled out?
[00:48:12.134 --> 00:48:16.857]  Even Fox News would have guests on, prestigious scientists going, the road to hell is this vaccine?
[00:48:16.857 --> 00:48:19.579]  I'd rather die than take it.
[00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:20.900]  This will torture the hell out of me.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.601]  Remember those headlines?
[00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:25.163]  And even I was like, whoa, that's pretty wild, man.
[00:48:26.462 --> 00:48:35.447]  And I've got all the clips here of Dr. Yidan, the former head of Pfizer operations, top scientist, saying, I mean, he just retired two years ago right before this happened.
[00:48:35.447 --> 00:48:38.489]  And then he's up there saying, this is an agenda.
[00:48:38.489 --> 00:48:40.250]  This isn't about protecting you from COVID.
[00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.552]  This is an agenda.
[00:48:43.552 --> 00:48:46.234]  This is about depopulation.
[00:48:46.234 --> 00:48:51.137]  It'd be like having Dale Earnhardt and his pride in his prime
[00:48:53.905 --> 00:49:03.032]  In 1989 or something, or 1990, tell you this car's got a problem, it's engine's gonna blow.
[00:49:03.032 --> 00:49:04.113]  Don't put it out on the track.
[00:49:04.113 --> 00:49:05.154]  You're like, who are you?
[00:49:05.154 --> 00:49:07.776]  You're just Dale Earnhardt.
[00:49:07.776 --> 00:49:09.638]  It'd be like Michael Jordan in his prime.
[00:49:12.591 --> 00:49:14.572]  And then he tells the coach, that's not a good player.
[00:49:14.572 --> 00:49:17.353]  I think you should cut him off the team or I don't want him out here with me.
[00:49:17.353 --> 00:49:18.293]  They're going to lose us the game.
[00:49:18.293 --> 00:49:19.534]  You listen to Michael Jordan.
[00:49:19.534 --> 00:49:21.875]  I mean, it's the Michael Jordans.
[00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:23.155]  It's the Dale Earnhards.
[00:49:23.155 --> 00:49:31.299]  It's the Tom Brady's of science are told us exactly what was going to happen.
[00:49:31.299 --> 00:49:34.080]  And I feel like I am in the twilight zone here.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.701]  Because I can read these damn studies all day.
[00:49:36.701 --> 00:49:38.182]  I read them for three hours this morning.
[00:49:38.182 --> 00:49:39.243]  And I started crying.
[00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:39.843]  I'm not going to lie.
[00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.985]  It wasn't a crying of, like, sad.
[00:49:41.985 --> 00:49:46.648]  It was a crying because I want to start killing people!
[00:49:46.648 --> 00:49:47.689]  And I'm not going to do it.
[00:49:47.689 --> 00:49:49.010]  I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:53.633]  But I'm saying they are attacking us.
[00:49:53.633 --> 00:49:56.195]  It's not normal to have this going on.
[00:49:56.195 --> 00:50:00.818]  This is crazy!
[00:50:00.818 --> 00:50:02.780]  It'd be like having Muhammad Ali
[00:50:04.224 --> 00:50:27.720]  In his prime, in 1968, when he's heavyweight champion of the world, tell you how to throw a right jab, and you tell him he doesn't know what he's talking about, and you got some five-year-old with snot coming out of their nose, advising everybody, and that's Fauci!
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.862]  It's ridiculous!
[00:50:33.953 --> 00:50:35.694]  They are killing us!
[00:50:35.694 --> 00:50:36.795]  They are assaulting us!
[00:50:36.795 --> 00:50:38.557]  They are punching us!
[00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.258]  And slapping us over and over again!
[00:50:40.258 --> 00:50:41.139]  And I'm just... Thank you!
[00:50:41.139 --> 00:50:41.399]  Thank you!
[00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:41.999]  Can I have another?
[00:50:41.999 --> 00:50:42.540]  Can I have another?
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.661]  Oh, now you want my kids!
[00:50:43.661 --> 00:50:44.261]  Oh yeah!
[00:50:44.261 --> 00:50:47.704]  Oh yeah!
[00:50:47.704 --> 00:50:52.308]  So... We cannot be violent.
[00:50:54.124 --> 00:50:57.505]  We cannot get into their track, because I saw Klaus Schwab.
[00:50:57.505 --> 00:50:58.105]  Guys, find it.
[00:50:58.105 --> 00:50:59.225]  I think you're great.
[00:50:59.225 --> 00:51:00.726]  There's so many videos.
[00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:03.327]  Klaus Schwab says, the world is very angry.
[00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:04.307]  Great anger coming.
[00:51:04.307 --> 00:51:05.187]  That's the clip.
[00:51:05.187 --> 00:51:07.748]  He goes, I know you hate the lockdowns.
[00:51:07.748 --> 00:51:09.608]  I know there's great anger.
[00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.369]  Soon, great reset.
[00:51:11.369 --> 00:51:13.109]  Soon, you'll not be angry.
[00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:16.790]  And it's so creepy.
[00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.451]  When you know who he is, and you know what he's done,
[00:51:19.895 --> 00:51:27.861]  And that's what they want, because they want us to just go crazy and all kill each other in a race war or, you know, go start stringing up politicians.
[00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:31.003]  Let me tell you, Andrew Cuomo didn't run Jack's squad.
[00:51:31.003 --> 00:51:35.887]  I'm glad he's gone, but that's just to scare their minions into behaving.
[00:51:37.901 --> 00:51:39.201]  It's Bill Gates.
[00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:40.522]  It's Klaus Schwab.
[00:51:40.522 --> 00:51:41.642]  It's the Rockefellers.
[00:51:41.642 --> 00:51:42.683]  It's the Rothschilds.
[00:51:42.683 --> 00:51:44.183]  It's the ruling globalists.
[00:51:44.183 --> 00:51:46.004]  It's people like Anderson Cooper.
[00:51:46.004 --> 00:51:48.205]  Anderson Cooper's one of the richest men in the world.
[00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.585]  Richard and Bill Gates.
[00:51:49.585 --> 00:51:54.487]  He's the heir of the entire six different robber baron families all married into one.
[00:51:54.487 --> 00:51:55.027]  He got it all.
[00:51:55.027 --> 00:51:55.667]  Trillions.
[00:51:55.667 --> 00:51:56.848]  He owns everything.
[00:51:56.848 --> 00:51:59.429]  That's why you look up at him, he says he owns nothing.
[00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:02.210]  Everything's a lie.
[00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:03.190]  And he's an aster.
[00:52:07.555 --> 00:52:09.115]  And he just wants to kill you.
[00:52:09.115 --> 00:52:12.476]  I mean, you need to understand the guy's a frickin' vampire.
[00:52:12.476 --> 00:52:19.358]  I don't mean he grows fangs at night, but when you look at Anderson Cooper, that is a Lucifer creature.
[00:52:19.358 --> 00:52:26.839]  You better believe when he gets on his knees at night, he talks to the devil.
[00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:31.480]  And everything they do is an assault on humanity.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.361]  Everything they do is for their god to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:52:36.431 --> 00:52:41.834]  And the minute you start figuring that out, the minute you understand how much trouble we're in.
[00:52:41.834 --> 00:52:44.516]  So I haven't figured out all the angles, but I know they're killing us for sure.
[00:52:44.516 --> 00:52:53.581]  And I don't know why they're particularly trying to wipe out all the white countries, while they're also targeting Africans.
[00:52:53.581 --> 00:53:03.067]  But if you look at the whole attack, and they're attacking everybody, they're attacking white people with one arm, and black people with the other arm, and I haven't figured it all out yet, but it's crazy.
[00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:14.719]  But I think they're attacking any group, they have looked into the future, they've studied how things work, and there's something coming, some alliance, some development, something they're trying to stop.
[00:53:14.719 --> 00:53:15.840]  And I haven't figured it out yet.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.163]  I need you to think about that collectively, we can come up with the answer.
[00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:27.530]  But, they'll go out of their way to dumb down and kill black people, they'll go out of their way to dumb down and kill white people, and then they're trying to kill everybody else at the same time.
[00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:35.602]  But they aren't as worried about the Asians and the Latin Americans.
[00:53:35.602 --> 00:53:36.983]  And the Latin Americans are really Asian.
[00:53:36.983 --> 00:53:41.984]  The predominant bloodline is of, quote, Native Americans is Chinese.
[00:53:41.984 --> 00:53:43.965]  Same genetics.
[00:53:43.965 --> 00:53:45.905]  And I haven't triggered it all yet.
[00:53:45.905 --> 00:53:51.907]  I'm not Lucifer, this off-world thing that already has been around for billions of years or whatever, and it knows what it's doing, okay?
[00:53:51.907 --> 00:53:59.809]  I'm just here fighting and trying to figure out, okay, here's the attacks, here's what's going on, here's who they're targeting, and we're watching this war take place, and
[00:54:01.161 --> 00:54:02.181]  I don't know.
[00:54:02.181 --> 00:54:03.262]  I don't know.
[00:54:03.262 --> 00:54:06.142]  But you notice they want white people and black people fight with each other.
[00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:10.984]  And if you understand that, if you figure out why they're doing that, I think you answer the puzzle to this whole deal.
[00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.791]  We finally got him a good treatment, and he got better really quick.
[00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:38.692]  When he went to the doctor, they wouldn't give him vitamin C, they wouldn't give him D, they wouldn't give him anything.
[00:54:38.692 --> 00:54:42.112]  They weren't giving him steroids, none of it.
[00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:45.913]  And as soon as he got that, he got better, but that's what happens to so many people.
[00:54:45.913 --> 00:54:47.574]  And Rob was in the hospital last week.
[00:54:47.574 --> 00:54:51.774]  I didn't want to get his private stuff, but he put out a video on himself, so I can talk about it now.
[00:54:51.774 --> 00:54:53.935]  That was another thing stressing the hell out of me last week.
[00:54:55.558 --> 00:55:02.901]  So we got all that going on and the media's attacking the cyber symposium, calling it a failure.
[00:55:02.901 --> 00:55:05.422]  I think it's a really big success.
[00:55:05.422 --> 00:55:09.324]  In courage, in honor, in will, in truth.
[00:55:09.324 --> 00:55:11.625]  I watched a lot of it.
[00:55:11.625 --> 00:55:15.887]  And they're bringing out real algorithms, real proof, shows real cases of fraud.
[00:55:15.887 --> 00:55:23.030]  But I warned Lindell privately and publicly, I said, this China packet capture you got is a classic setup.
[00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:28.223]  And it's run by an individual that even set up the Pentagon.
[00:55:28.223 --> 00:55:30.385]  And I said, you really ought to move away from that.
[00:55:30.385 --> 00:55:31.766]  And Lindell said, no, you'll see the proof.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.381]  And I said, okay, I'll see the proof.
[00:55:35.381 --> 00:55:40.383]  And so that's now overshadowing that it was just random code and wasn't even real code.
[00:55:40.383 --> 00:55:44.084]  And then suddenly the guy that gave them it has had a stroke and can't talk to Lindell.
[00:55:44.084 --> 00:55:56.628]  And I mean, what do you do when you've got overwhelming evidence of an election stolen and they had all this proof and all these real hackers, all these real documents that is coming out in the symposium, but it's all overshadowed with Q stuff.
[00:55:56.628 --> 00:55:58.229]  And look, I've been set up before too.
[00:55:58.229 --> 00:55:59.589]  I'm not here putting Lindell down.
[00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:00.810]  I'm admiring.
[00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.590]  He's a man of the arena.
[00:56:02.796 --> 00:56:04.317]  And I've learned how these guys are.
[00:56:04.317 --> 00:56:05.658]  You know, men are alpha males.
[00:56:05.658 --> 00:56:06.198]  They're smart.
[00:56:06.198 --> 00:56:07.379]  They think they know everything.
[00:56:07.379 --> 00:56:11.422]  I've learned to just sit there and tell them, this is what's going to happen.
[00:56:11.422 --> 00:56:12.723]  Didn't embarrass him on air with it.
[00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:13.403]  Did it privately.
[00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:16.986]  And I said, this is what's going to happen, so that when it happens, he'll listen to me next time.
[00:56:19.537 --> 00:56:29.642]  You've now seen it happen, but it doesn't take away from his courage or what he's done, or the blueprint of fraud that's coming out, and how we're going to oppose the globalists, and how everything they've got is bet on election fraud.
[00:56:29.642 --> 00:56:31.263]  That is all amazing.
[00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:44.049]  It's just that the BS stuff that was put in there, of the total proof and all the packets of the entire election, and proof China did it, and then the guys, his own people, looked at the code, he finally gave it to them, and they said, sir, this is a simulation, it's not even real.
[00:56:46.857 --> 00:56:53.199]  And just like Q quit doing posts when the scam was up, now this guy won't talk to Lindell.
[00:56:53.199 --> 00:56:57.280]  And he set up the Pentagon before this guy.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.542]  And so you talk about a sophisticated operator.
[00:57:02.542 --> 00:57:04.202]  Look, you'd never know this stuff until you've been through it.
[00:57:04.202 --> 00:57:04.803]  And I've been through it.
[00:57:04.803 --> 00:57:05.663]  I've been set up.
[00:57:05.663 --> 00:57:06.603]  I've been set up.
[00:57:06.603 --> 00:57:07.943]  Lindell's new to this fight.
[00:57:07.943 --> 00:57:09.464]  He's doing a great job.
[00:57:09.464 --> 00:57:15.766]  I mean, I'd say for somebody who came out of nowhere into the major leagues of politics, he's done an incredible job as a man in the arena.
[00:57:16.519 --> 00:57:23.729]  It's like going to boxing training camp for three months, we've never boxed and get in the ring with Mike Tyson.
[00:57:23.729 --> 00:57:28.936]  He did it and actually knocked Mike Tyson down one time, but Tyson just got up and beat the living hell out of him.
[00:57:28.936 --> 00:57:32.501]  So that's the allegory, and we're doing sporting analogies here.
[00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:33.442]  So I admire the guy.
[00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:39.390]  They set his ass up, so we need to learn from this and move forward.
[00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:44.175]  The key is, we're building awareness of election fraud and building opposition to it, and that's what's important.
[00:57:44.175 --> 00:57:46.137]  Because fighting builds your muscles.
[00:57:46.137 --> 00:57:47.399]  Struggle makes you strong.
[00:57:49.221 --> 00:57:57.386]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of, where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash?
[00:57:57.386 --> 00:58:05.492]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a bestseller within six months, and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns in the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[00:58:05.492 --> 00:58:08.714]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply.
[00:58:08.714 --> 00:58:09.734]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[00:58:09.734 --> 00:58:11.636]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[00:58:11.636 --> 00:58:14.858]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or if you haven't tried it,

[00:58:51.257 --> 00:58:59.464]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:59:00.697 --> 00:59:05.461]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[00:59:43.227 --> 00:59:46.048]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:59:46.048 --> 00:59:53.271]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.933]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.851 --> 01:00:11.673]  The targeting of our children is live.
[01:00:11.673 --> 01:00:20.439]  Any species that allows the targeting of its young is a species in collapse, headed towards extinction.
[01:00:20.439 --> 01:00:23.401]  Here's Tucker Carlson knocking out of the park and more.
[01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:27.624]  Coming up, there is no informed consent with these deadly shots.
[01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.765]  We have some special guests.
[01:00:28.765 --> 01:00:29.125]  Stay with us.
[01:00:30.305 --> 01:00:37.631]  Watch this school board member from Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, tell you that maskless kids in classrooms could be committing murder.
[01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:46.298]  It's insane to send 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 all the way up through 11 year olds that don't have a choice about vaccine.
[01:00:46.298 --> 01:00:55.005]  To sit in a classroom where people can spread a deadly disease and not even know they're sick, that's just not okay.
[01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:57.507]  For kids to commit murder by coming to school without a mask.
[01:00:59.994 --> 01:01:05.275]  Your four-year-old goes to school without a mask and is committing murder.
[01:01:05.275 --> 01:01:06.856]  Where's this all going?
[01:01:06.856 --> 01:01:07.816]  Will it stop here?
[01:01:07.816 --> 01:01:09.417]  It hasn't so far.
[01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:18.899]  So if you want to know what our future may look like, take a look at what is happening on the distant fringes of the Anglosphere in the formerly reasonable Australia, a country all Americans love.
[01:01:18.899 --> 01:01:25.641]  You're seeing footage right now of decontamination tents that have been set up in people's yards in Sydney, Australia.
[01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:28.082]  The Australian military is now enforcing martial law.
[01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:31.143]  What's the justification for this?
[01:01:31.143 --> 01:01:33.884]  Because nine people died of COVID this summer.
[01:01:33.884 --> 01:01:37.785]  Nine people in the entire nation of Australia.
[01:01:37.785 --> 01:01:43.247]  Australia's Chief Health Officer is now commanding citizens not to speak to their neighbours.
[01:01:43.247 --> 01:01:46.728]  Speaking to other human beings is just too dangerous.
[01:01:46.728 --> 01:01:48.869]  We need to limit our movements.
[01:01:51.118 --> 01:02:02.328]  We need to consider whenever we leave our house that anyone with us and anyone we come into contact with could convey the virus.
[01:02:02.328 --> 01:02:14.199]  So whilst it is in human nature to engage in conversation with others, to be friendly, unfortunately this is not the time to do that.
[01:02:14.199 --> 01:02:16.381]  So even if you run into your next door neighbour
[01:02:17.422 --> 01:02:21.303]  It's humiliating, obviously, and it's cowardice, and it's lack of proportion.
[01:02:21.303 --> 01:02:22.104]  But it's also scary.
[01:02:22.104 --> 01:02:23.964]  It's human nature to communicate with other people?
[01:02:23.964 --> 01:02:24.124]  No.
[01:02:24.124 --> 01:02:26.185]  It's a human need to communicate with other people.
[01:02:46.775 --> 01:02:56.782]  Now, with an increase in RSV around the country, some, Phil, thought there could be a link with the rise in hospitalized pediatric COVID cases.
[01:02:56.782 --> 01:03:09.091]  The Houston Chronicle reported this today, saying Texas Children's identified 25 cases and counting of children with both RSV and COVID at all three of its campuses.
[01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:13.394]  More than half of those children have been hospitalized.
[01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:14.035]  Phil, again,
[01:03:15.215 --> 01:03:34.029]  We're not being told whether the kids are being admitted sick with RSV, which again, it seems like that's the case, because the transparency doesn't really feed the panic that I think, sadly, some in our society want to keep going.
[01:03:36.499 --> 01:04:00.189]  Yeah, look, one of the things we know about pediatric hospitalizations with COVID, and we've had multiple studies that have found this now over and over in multiple countries, a lot of them are incidental, which is to say children are there for some other reason, they broke a leg, whatever it is, we now test everyone who goes in the hospitals, they happen to test positive, they were asymptomatic, it was not the reason they were there, but it goes on the medical record and it goes into the statistics that everyone sees now.
[01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:08.978]  You can look at that and studies after the fact and kind of separate it, but it's much, much harder when they're in there for a respiratory virus and they have a co-infection.
[01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:14.143]  That's never going to be separated out in a study because how could you determine which virus is the reason they're there?
[01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:23.133]  But for children under five, based on everything we know about the respective viruses, the pathogenicity in these co-infected cases is almost definitely from the RSV.
[01:04:23.633 --> 01:04:31.897]  And there was an AAP study last year finding that 50% of pediatric COVID hospitalizations had co-infections with other common viruses.
[01:04:31.897 --> 01:04:41.502]  And so, you know, I think it's almost certain that a very large number of the hospitalizations that are now being reported are RSV co-infections.
[01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:43.283]  And in fact, Laura, they may not even be that.
[01:04:43.283 --> 01:04:48.526]  They may be COVID negative RSV infections, because a lot of these articles are written in sort of crafty ways.
[01:04:48.766 --> 01:04:53.749]  To make it seem like the children's hospitals are overflowing with COVID, but really they're overflowing with RSV.
[01:04:53.749 --> 01:05:00.492]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:05:00.492 --> 01:05:09.837]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[01:05:09.837 --> 01:05:15.920]  With promo code ALEX with mypillow.com or frankspeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.240]  It's an amazing
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:16.840]  Amazing deal.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.801]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[01:05:19.801 --> 01:05:26.363]  You can get my games and dream sheets, normally a hundred and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[01:05:26.363 --> 01:05:32.025]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[01:05:32.025 --> 01:05:34.566]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[01:05:34.566 --> 01:05:37.947]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:39.967]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:05:39.967 --> 01:05:41.868]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:05:41.868 --> 01:05:45.189]  Your best special is using the promo code ALEX and you're supporting
[01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:47.711]  You're an example of resistance.
[01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:48.372]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[01:06:16.843 --> 01:06:19.984]  I'm coming with love, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:21.625]  I'm coming with love for humanity.
[01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:34.609]  I'm coming for a belief in our species and belief in our planet and life and what God gave us and that we can populate the stars and build a thousand worlds together and live together for peace through eternity in God's vision.
[01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:36.270]  But first, you've gotta ride.
[01:06:38.888 --> 01:06:49.536]  You've got to stand up and resist evil and resist the wickedness of the universe that seeks to destroy and steal your birthright.
[01:06:49.536 --> 01:07:04.947]  I want you to wake up and I want you to join me now in a pledge to love yourself and to love your family and to never let somebody tell you to wear a dirty mask or that you're diseased or that you're bad and that you've got to bow down to them.
[01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:14.163]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live now into hour number two.
[01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:17.686]  I am a wild child, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:17.686 --> 01:07:22.850]  I am not bowing down to Bill Gates and Fauci and Klaus Schwab and the rest of these globalists.
[01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.653]  So let's get into it right now.
[01:07:25.653 --> 01:07:26.734]  There is so much to hit.
[01:07:28.148 --> 01:07:31.211]  Tucker Carlson covered it last night, we covered it yesterday.
[01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:43.886]  I just saw the transcript out of the Daily Oklahoman, I didn't know there was actual video of this, of the school board saying, children are murderers, they could be giving off something that's going to kill people.
[01:07:44.895 --> 01:08:00.909]  When the science shows it's the so-called GMO vaccine that's giving off the spike protein and it's the spike protein hurting and killing people, but this monster wants to sit up there because she scripted it where she's the hero and say our children are terrorists.
[01:08:00.909 --> 01:08:10.397]  Meanwhile, we've got big news if you buy into all the COVID hysteria with the border wide open and buses being delivered of untested COVID patients to Austin.
[01:08:11.735 --> 01:08:15.057]  That's even on KXAN now, local TV.
[01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:18.860]  I almost fell out of my chair this morning when I saw it.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:28.266]  But, here is this monster declaring the new suspects, the new bad guys, the new Al Capones, the new Jeffrey Epsteins.
[01:08:28.266 --> 01:08:30.167]  It's your children.
[01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.748]  We're all dirty.
[01:08:31.748 --> 01:08:32.809]  We're all dangerous.
[01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:38.393]  So wear a mask that doesn't even stop transmission of anything, but just show your fealty to her.
[01:08:38.393 --> 01:08:39.653]  Here it is.
[01:08:39.653 --> 01:08:40.114]  Insane.
[01:08:41.348 --> 01:08:48.153]  To send 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 all the way up through 11 year olds that don't have a choice about vaccine.
[01:08:48.153 --> 01:08:54.598]  To sit in a classroom where people can spread a deadly disease and not even know they're sick.
[01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:59.342]  It's just not okay for kids to commit murder by coming to school without a mask.
[01:09:00.734 --> 01:09:16.563]  You would never be able to come out of your house again, if you believe this woman, and all society would break down, and we'd starve to death, because no one could go out and drive trucks, or plant fields, or fix vehicles, or fix satellite uplinks, you know, the millions of things there are to do.
[01:09:16.563 --> 01:09:17.364]  And that's already killed.
[01:09:17.364 --> 01:09:28.971]  20 extra million people starved to death, because this woman is so disconnected from reality, and doesn't know how the world works, that 20 million extra people starved to death
[01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:41.196]  In the last year under lockdowns, while this hog, this taxpayer-funded pig, sits up there saying our children are murderers.
[01:09:41.196 --> 01:09:48.959]  Now, here is Dr. Michael Yeadon, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, you pig woman.
[01:09:48.959 --> 01:09:55.123]  The former chief scientist who just retired two and a half years ago, with the highest accreditations.
[01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:57.544]  A guy that believes in real vaccines if they're clean.
[01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:11.749]  Saying, I don't know what's going on, but we've never developed a cold virus vaccine because it will see the shell that is approaching our body and attack our body.
[01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:18.673]  And instead they souped up the protein to have even more proteins that are on our body to design it to attack us.
[01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:25.917]  And Yidan wrote a huge report with links to dozens of studies with Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Advisory Board.
[01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:27.118]  THE EU Advisor!
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.262]  And they censored him and they blocked him everywhere.
[01:10:34.329 --> 01:10:37.391]  That was December 1st of last year.
[01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:58.829]  Before the inoculations began, they signed an emergency petition saying, you're going to see blood clots, you're going to see hemorrhaging in the lungs, you're going to see strokes, you're going to see sterilization, you're going to see auto body dependency, you're going to see all and get exactly what the top scientists said happened.
[01:10:58.829 --> 01:11:02.452]  And then Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the big tech try to suppress
[01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:08.549]  Because this isn't doctors, this is a globalist attack.
[01:11:08.549 --> 01:11:10.410]  Now, I've harped on this forever.
[01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:13.711]  It's finally getting attention in Congress.
[01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:18.613]  But here is Dr. Yidan, this is 15B.
[01:11:18.613 --> 01:11:22.915]  So many clips, I've got to be clear with the crew because I move around a lot.
[01:11:22.915 --> 01:11:26.937]  Talking about this just last week.
[01:11:26.937 --> 01:11:31.179]  In terms of safety, Dr. Wolfgang Bodar of Germany and myself,
[01:11:31.849 --> 01:11:38.195]  First of December 2020, you can go and find our petition, the Bodog and Eden EMA petition, December 2020.
[01:11:38.195 --> 01:11:42.820]  Now, we were smeared all over the media.
[01:11:43.672 --> 01:11:47.436]  But all we said was, in essence, in our petition, was what I've just said to you.
[01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:49.217]  These are new kinds of medicines.
[01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:55.743]  We're going very quickly and we really urge the regulator to slow down and do a staged approval.
[01:11:55.743 --> 01:12:00.448]  Because we were worried, we chatted, we were worried they were just going to blaze away and give it to everybody.
[01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:02.390]  That was a good guess, wasn't it?
[01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.612]  And so we said we're concerned about
[01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:11.299]  Toxicity, because these are completely new medicines and we haven't really seen adequate characterisation.
[01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:15.661]  So we predicted just non-specific toxicity, which was worrying.
[01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:21.523]  One of the things we were concerned about was a potential effect on fertility and pregnancy.
[01:12:21.523 --> 01:12:23.124]  And I'm going to come back to that one.
[01:12:23.124 --> 01:12:25.365]  I can't remember what the other one was.
[01:12:25.365 --> 01:12:26.265]  Never mind.
[01:12:26.265 --> 01:12:31.027]  Anyway, so now these have been rolled out and hundreds of millions of people have been given them.
[01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:34.749]  By the way, many people, for example the elderly and ill,
[01:12:35.498 --> 01:12:42.023]  For whom these were meant to be the great saviour, you do know that those people weren't really included in the clinical trials.
[01:12:42.023 --> 01:12:46.807]  Most of the companies, and that's quite normal, they limited the number of people who were very sick.
[01:12:46.807 --> 01:12:51.390]  You don't want deaths on your trial, because you want a clean signal initially.
[01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:52.991]  And that's why trials take a long time.
[01:12:52.991 --> 01:12:56.214]  You first do the trial in, say, what we call healthy elderly.
[01:12:57.186 --> 01:13:04.510]  And then, if that looks OK, maybe you'll add some people who are much older and really quite frail and just see that it's still OK.
[01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:05.991]  And then they didn't do that.
[01:13:05.991 --> 01:13:10.593]  They just did the healthy elderly, pretty much, and they blazed away at the old people's homes.
[01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:12.934]  Unsurprisingly, lots of people died shortly thereafter.
[01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:16.316]  They had no idea whether it would happen or not, and then they covered it up.
[01:13:16.316 --> 01:13:17.477]  But that's what happened.
[01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:25.901]  That's why we got this massive spike, a synchronised spike in the UK on rollout of the vaccines, and it occurred at the same date everywhere.
[01:13:27.065 --> 01:13:31.466]  It can't occur the same dates everywhere if it's a naturally spreading virus, can it?
[01:13:31.466 --> 01:13:33.886]  Because it would take days to weeks to move around the country.
[01:13:33.886 --> 01:13:39.748]  It all spiked on the same day because they all started vaccinating on the same day.
[01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:41.428]  That's why it happened.
[01:13:41.428 --> 01:13:51.290]  That's the former chief scientist at Pfizer saying, we've seen an explosion in Covid since the shot started all over the world on the days it began.
[01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:55.190]  And now the hospitals are actually full.
[01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:58.272]  And they're saying, oh, let's lock down again, because the hospitals are full.
[01:13:58.272 --> 01:14:00.293]  But they're the ones that fill the hospitals.
[01:14:00.293 --> 01:14:02.935]  And remember, the first man, a relative of William Shakespeare.
[01:14:02.935 --> 01:14:08.058]  I guess if I was related to William Shakespeare, I'd give myself the first name William.
[01:14:08.058 --> 01:14:09.599]  My mom's told me we have another son.
[01:14:09.599 --> 01:14:10.700]  She wants it to be named William.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:11.340]  It's a great name.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.283]  But there's William Shakespeare, related to William Shakespeare.
[01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:16.163]  First man to take it.
[01:14:16.163 --> 01:14:17.924]  He died really quick after.
[01:14:17.924 --> 01:14:19.565]  Bye bye, William.
[01:14:19.565 --> 01:14:20.886]  Thanks for being a trooper.
[01:14:20.886 --> 01:14:22.107]  He wanted to help everybody.
[01:14:23.612 --> 01:14:26.513]  First woman to take a dive, dude, you know that?
[01:14:26.513 --> 01:14:30.514]  But hey, it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay, right?
[01:14:30.514 --> 01:14:35.836]  They run death camps in China, Apple does, but they really want to take care of you.
[01:14:35.836 --> 01:14:44.439]  And now Apple said, we're going to read everything you say, scan all your photos, watch you in live time, because we're the privacy company, along with a big campaign of privacy.
[01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:45.819]  Privacy, you can trust Apple.
[01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.700]  Apple doesn't spy on you, Apple doesn't watch you.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.921]  We just read everything you do and scan all your photos.
[01:14:50.765 --> 01:14:53.826]  And if you got a picture of your two-year-old in the shower, you're going to prison.
[01:14:53.826 --> 01:14:57.508]  But we run death camps and, you know, probably half our leadership are pedophiles.
[01:14:57.508 --> 01:14:59.869]  But that's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:14:59.869 --> 01:15:02.250]  You see, you learn how this works, you understand.
[01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:12.655]  It's all sickening evil, all right out in the open, just a total commitment to authoritarianism because the public acts passive and weak and pathetic.
[01:15:14.278 --> 01:15:22.471]  So they give us a so-called vaccine that's not, that makes people sick, that lowers your immune system, and Bill Gates said a year and a half ago in his prospectus, he goes, I'm going to make even more money.
[01:15:22.471 --> 01:15:24.854]  He says, I'm making 200% on my investments.
[01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.118]  He said on a CNBC show, didn't realize what he was doing.
[01:15:27.118 --> 01:15:28.019]  He's like autistic.
[01:15:28.874 --> 01:15:31.356]  He goes, yeah, they're gonna have to have boosters forever.
[01:15:31.356 --> 01:15:33.337]  It's really a gene therapy.
[01:15:33.337 --> 01:15:34.037]  Oh really?
[01:15:34.037 --> 01:15:34.838]  He says it!
[01:15:34.838 --> 01:15:38.580]  People are like, how did Jones know they would have a booster?
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.401]  How did- Jones is with them!
[01:15:40.401 --> 01:15:42.423]  I see all the- Jones must be with them!
[01:15:42.423 --> 01:15:43.043]  With them, yeah!
[01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:44.744]  Watch Bill Gates say it!
[01:15:44.744 --> 01:15:46.305]  I guess I am with them!
[01:15:46.305 --> 01:15:46.665]  Idiots!
[01:15:46.665 --> 01:15:51.108]  I don't mean our general audience, but man, these people that think I'm with them because I know all this?
[01:15:51.108 --> 01:15:52.829]  They write white papers!
[01:15:52.829 --> 01:15:56.391]  They've got- They're all saying it!
[01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:56.972]  Gosh!

[01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:34.671]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[01:18:34.671 --> 01:18:41.172]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.

[01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:03.918]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds.
[01:19:03.918 --> 01:19:05.419]  I was overweight.
[01:19:05.419 --> 01:19:07.680]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.641]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:12.122]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it.
[01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:15.484]  So, the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked great.
[01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:16.645]  Pretty good.
[01:19:16.645 --> 01:19:22.052]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[01:19:22.052 --> 01:19:22.693]  So I took it.
[01:19:22.693 --> 01:19:29.022]  And then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[01:19:29.022 --> 01:19:30.464]  You know, I could think again.
[01:19:30.464 --> 01:19:31.866]  I could connect with people again.
[01:19:31.886 --> 01:19:32.726]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:34.487]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:20:02.651 --> 01:20:11.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.578 --> 01:20:27.111]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:27.111 --> 01:20:30.974]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:45.310]  Alright, the whole world government rollout forced inoculation program has a little bit of an Achilles heel.
[01:20:45.310 --> 01:21:00.295]  And that is, in Western Europe, in the UK, in Australia, in New Zealand, in the United States, in Canada, we supposedly have elections, because we're a republic, other areas are quote democracies, and we're able to put our representatives in and have self-rule.
[01:21:01.974 --> 01:21:04.916]  That's why what Mike Lindell has been doing is so great.
[01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:07.558]  Now I've talked to people that are lawyers for Trump.
[01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:11.740]  I've talked to folks on air like Robert Barnes that was involved in Georgia and other states.
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.341]  I was there as well.
[01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:14.462]  We knew how they did it.
[01:21:14.462 --> 01:21:16.703]  They sent out all the ballots.
[01:21:16.703 --> 01:21:18.805]  They sent out tens of millions of them.
[01:21:18.805 --> 01:21:24.248]  They had Democrats put the names of dead people and folks that moved out of state down on there.
[01:21:24.248 --> 01:21:25.249]  But Mike Lindell
[01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:33.066]  Got targeted, and I'm not gonna even go through a bunch of names, because these people sue you if you even mention them.
[01:21:33.066 --> 01:21:35.127]  And I'm not scared of being sued, but their names don't matter.
[01:21:35.127 --> 01:21:37.769]  You can read all the articles for yourself.
[01:21:37.769 --> 01:21:42.673]  But just like I told you, Q was controlled.
[01:21:42.673 --> 01:21:45.035]  A lot of real stuff was said, a lot of disinfo was said.
[01:21:45.035 --> 01:21:51.559]  How do you discredit somebody that's actually out there trying to expose real stuff?
[01:21:51.559 --> 01:21:56.023]  Well, you tell them, we've got all the files of all the election captured from China,
[01:21:57.662 --> 01:22:02.926]  And it's going to prove that it's a fraud.
[01:22:02.926 --> 01:22:09.951]  And then Lindell had his conference.
[01:22:09.951 --> 01:22:15.835]  And I watched it and he had all these top scientists and intelligence experts from the NSA on showing the algorithm.
[01:22:15.835 --> 01:22:23.921]  You know, the famous thing in Michigan where Trump's winning and then suddenly they close the county station and it surges up.
[01:22:27.839 --> 01:22:32.180]  So it's very simple how all this works.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.381]  It was true that George W. Bush did a terrible job of the International Guard.
[01:22:35.381 --> 01:22:37.961]  It was true he was AWOL and on cocaine most of the time.
[01:22:37.961 --> 01:22:46.443]  So Karl Rove sent Dan Rather, who I don't like either, a bunch of documents that were real with a few fake pages in it.
[01:22:46.443 --> 01:22:49.124]  And then once you cover the fake pages, you're done.
[01:22:49.124 --> 01:22:50.484]  And I've had this done to me.
[01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:54.640]  This isn't some, I'm up here telling Mike Lindell and see I was right.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.201]  I had Mike on, you've seen.
[01:22:56.201 --> 01:23:07.085]  And I said, hey, I'd focus on the briefcases coming out and the suitcases and running them over and over again on the same machines and them saying the water main's broken, the van's pulling in in Michigan with extra ballots.
[01:23:07.085 --> 01:23:12.387]  Because that's how they did it, was ballots into the machines.
[01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:19.130]  Not so much, though some proof came out in the symposium at state level, that there were people hacking machines.
[01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:21.111]  Not just Dominion machines, but other machines.
[01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:27.247]  So that's how this works.
[01:23:27.247 --> 01:23:32.950]  And you had all these algorithm experts on and they proved that there was garbage going on.
[01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:36.851]  But we know they violated state laws.
[01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:43.114]  In six states to not have laws passed that they can suddenly have these mail-in ballots and not have the signatures verified.
[01:23:43.114 --> 01:23:47.996]  I mean we already know the election was a scam on those merits but if you look at Sidney Powell
[01:23:49.329 --> 01:24:00.451]  And you look at Rudolph Giuliani and the rest of them, they're good people, but they listened to individuals who are famous for what they do.
[01:24:02.014 --> 01:24:04.476]  And so I think Mike Lindell's event's been very successful.
[01:24:04.476 --> 01:24:06.537]  98% of it's been very accurate.
[01:24:06.537 --> 01:24:12.662]  You're not going to have a grassroots event like this live that is going to not have snafus and problems and issues.
[01:24:12.662 --> 01:24:15.084]  So I admire Mike Lindell as the man in the arena.
[01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:19.927]  And I think we should go forward and build a bigger movement against election fraud and investigate everything.
[01:24:19.927 --> 01:24:24.151]  And this is positive and the biggest movement I've seen in decades against election fraud.
[01:24:24.151 --> 01:24:28.494]  So I salute everybody involved.
[01:24:28.494 --> 01:24:29.655]  But overhead shot, please.
[01:24:29.655 --> 01:24:30.936]  Let's talk cold hard facts.
[01:24:32.045 --> 01:24:35.866]  Mike Lindell opens Thursday's Cyber Symposium with shocking developments.
[01:24:35.866 --> 01:24:39.428]  Another home-rated, credible threats conference infiltrated.
[01:24:39.428 --> 01:24:42.829]  Of course that went on, 100%.
[01:24:42.829 --> 01:24:43.209]  D.C.
[01:24:43.209 --> 01:24:49.071]  Trump-appointed judge allows Dominion 1.3 million damage case against Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Mike Lindell to proceed.
[01:24:51.192 --> 01:24:53.273]  Be prepared, this 2020 election may be worse.
[01:24:53.273 --> 01:24:55.914]  Oh yeah, the Democrats are up against a wall.
[01:24:55.914 --> 01:24:57.375]  Trump won the landslide.
[01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:58.955]  Breaking from the war room.
[01:24:58.955 --> 01:25:05.158]  Texas Governor Abbott supports forensic audit in Texas.
[01:25:05.158 --> 01:25:06.118]  Exclusive!
[01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:11.140]  Cyber expert says his team can't prove Mike Lindell's claims that China hacked election.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:14.401]  Now this is the key article in the Washington Times.
[01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.242]  This overshadows all the real stuff.
[01:25:16.242 --> 01:25:17.843]  All that file he said he had.
[01:25:19.124 --> 01:25:24.545]  And the individual that gave it to him that said that proof China had all the files and did it.
[01:25:24.545 --> 01:25:26.566]  Well, obviously, you can't have all the files at once.
[01:25:26.566 --> 01:25:27.486]  And I warned Lindell.
[01:25:27.486 --> 01:25:29.387]  I said, listen, you've got all this real stuff.
[01:25:29.387 --> 01:25:31.187]  This is you being set up.
[01:25:31.187 --> 01:25:42.230]  Well, it turns out the individual involved is married to an individual that, of course, works for the Democratic Party and the biggest Democratic Party law firm and a law firm that has quarterbacked operations against me.
[01:25:43.479 --> 01:25:47.802]  So when I saw these names and stuff months ago, I was like, oh my God, but Lindell wouldn't listen to me.
[01:25:47.802 --> 01:25:48.403]  And that's okay.
[01:25:48.403 --> 01:25:49.383]  He's a good guy.
[01:25:49.383 --> 01:25:51.725]  He just got in the arena at this level.
[01:25:51.725 --> 01:25:54.267]  He'll remember what I told him now.
[01:25:54.267 --> 01:26:03.434]  So, exclusive cyber expert says his team can't prove Mike Lindell's claims that China hacked the election.
[01:26:03.434 --> 01:26:05.435]  And who gave Mike Lindell all this information?
[01:26:05.435 --> 01:26:06.676]  Here's NPR headline.
[01:26:06.676 --> 01:26:08.618]  The man who conned the Pentagon.
[01:26:08.618 --> 01:26:09.999]  That wasn't even about politics then.
[01:26:11.206 --> 01:26:20.090]  But the guy that got the Pentagon to pay him a bunch of money to supposedly find secret al-Qaeda messages on broadcast TV and stuff.
[01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.910]  Report!
[01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:25.472]  Programmer cons CIA Pentagon into buying bogus anti-terror code.
[01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:26.372]  That's Wired Magazine.
[01:26:26.372 --> 01:26:27.973]  This is the same guy.
[01:26:27.973 --> 01:26:31.054]  Infamous hoax artist behind Trump World's new voter fraud claim.
[01:26:33.226 --> 01:26:37.709]  Arizona Sheriff's put $120,000 on probing involving Judge.
[01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:38.950]  Went nowhere.
[01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:48.896]  So, we have all of this information.
[01:26:48.896 --> 01:26:58.982]  And these people know they've got what the public wants to hear.
[01:26:58.982 --> 01:27:01.864]  And so now, it overshadows the whole thing
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:07.363]  Saying we have the absolute proof, China, it's all going to come out, it's all going to be here.
[01:27:07.363 --> 01:27:17.250]  And then Lindell gives it to the cyber people in his team and they look at it and they go, yeah, this is just basically a rendering of some numbers.
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:21.613]  Meanwhile, all these people brought forward stuff in Colorado and Arizona and all this proof.
[01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:28.275]  Of machines being hacked, access to all that incredibly valuable information.
[01:27:28.275 --> 01:27:29.356]  Obviously we saw what happened.
[01:27:29.356 --> 01:27:32.638]  They closed all those states up, jacked up the numbers for Biden with the ballots.
[01:27:32.638 --> 01:27:34.280]  They said it's going to be a red mirage.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.241]  It'll look like Trump won the first day.
[01:27:36.241 --> 01:27:37.482]  But after that, we've got the ballots.
[01:27:37.482 --> 01:27:41.545]  The Democrats said what they did.
[01:27:41.545 --> 01:27:44.267]  They 100% stole it.
[01:27:44.267 --> 01:27:51.813]  Well, we're all wearing face shields and helicopter hats and masks over our faces and all this other stupid crap.
[01:27:53.612 --> 01:28:00.817]  The globalists have run off and stolen our country and have us showing QR codes and going to restaurants and taking forced inoculations while the borders are wide open.
[01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.478]  And that's the news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:28:02.478 --> 01:28:04.920]  But overall, Mike Lindell's done a great job.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.881]  The cyber symposium's been amazing.
[01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:15.807]  I'm just upset that it's being overshadowed by the claim that we got all the proof, all the states, all the admissions, everything right there.
[01:28:15.807 --> 01:28:19.950]  And then the guy that gave it to him had a stroke yesterday.
[01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:21.071]  Can't talk to Mike Lindell.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:29.863]  Getting him right up there on the podium in front of everybody and then carpet out from under him right away.
[01:28:29.863 --> 01:28:35.326]  And then the guy's wife works for the Democratic Party and the rest of it.
[01:28:35.326 --> 01:28:36.927]  So I'll have more information for you.
[01:28:36.927 --> 01:28:39.728]  I'm going to do a whole report on this coming up.
[01:28:39.728 --> 01:28:41.689]  It's very, very important.
[01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:45.411]  We have a special guest, a syndicated talk show host, joining us.
[01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:49.013]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:08.628]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[01:29:08.628 --> 01:29:12.031]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it.
[01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:13.373]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[01:29:13.373 --> 01:29:14.454]  That's not negative.
[01:29:14.454 --> 01:29:16.255]  I'm not living in denial.
[01:29:16.255 --> 01:29:22.501]  And so, think of globalism as being hidden, as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:23.702]  That's actually a positive thing.
[01:29:24.483 --> 01:29:26.764]  And so yeah, Trump did overall a great job.
[01:29:26.764 --> 01:29:28.085]  They stole the election.
[01:29:28.085 --> 01:29:29.865]  We can't get down about that.
[01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:33.707]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:29:33.707 --> 01:29:37.049]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[01:29:37.049 --> 01:29:37.909]  They're scared.
[01:29:37.909 --> 01:29:41.310]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:42.591]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[01:29:42.591 --> 01:29:43.892]  They're trying to suppress us.
[01:29:43.892 --> 01:29:46.973]  Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody
[01:29:47.213 --> 01:29:48.293]  The world is awakening.
[01:29:48.293 --> 01:29:51.634]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[01:29:51.634 --> 01:29:58.716]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:26.940]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.083]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:35.909]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[01:30:35.909 --> 01:30:37.871]  You've got to trust in the plan of God.
[01:30:38.431 --> 01:30:38.932]  We're good to go.
[01:30:59.967 --> 01:31:05.271]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[01:31:05.271 --> 01:31:15.057]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:31:15.057 --> 01:31:17.959]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[01:31:17.959 --> 01:31:21.321]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:31:21.321 --> 01:31:22.522]  You got red blood.
[01:31:22.522 --> 01:31:29.447]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[01:31:30.047 --> 01:31:32.970]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:36.833]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:39.735]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:31:39.735 --> 01:31:44.599]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:47.261]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:31:47.261 --> 01:31:51.665]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:31:51.665 --> 01:31:55.768]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:31:55.768 --> 01:31:58.750]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support M4Horse.
[01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:59.111]  God bless.
[01:31:59.972 --> 01:32:08.137]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of, where is the activated charcoal toothpaste hand mouthwash?
[01:32:08.137 --> 01:32:09.578]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago.
[01:32:09.578 --> 01:32:11.600]  It became a bestseller within six months.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:16.243]  And now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns in the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[01:32:16.243 --> 01:32:19.465]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[01:32:19.465 --> 01:32:20.485]  Believe me, I'm happy too.

[01:33:03.468 --> 01:33:06.131]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.682 --> 01:33:28.692]  Aaron Olszewski was a veteran of Iraq and other theaters, and she volunteered during the COVID situation in New York.
[01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:30.708]  Last year.
[01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:33.449]  She was on with Owen again yesterday.
[01:33:33.449 --> 01:33:43.632]  And she witnessed them coding people that were three times not positive for COVID as COVID, who just had sore throats, putting them on ventilators and killing them.
[01:33:43.632 --> 01:33:49.513]  She even shot footage on her phone of the negative tests and the people that were murdered.
[01:33:49.513 --> 01:33:52.494]  She filed criminal complaints, came to the police.
[01:33:52.494 --> 01:33:54.495]  Nothing was done.
[01:33:56.203 --> 01:34:00.140]  There's the article yesterday, the interview, Narsu originally exposed Cuomo.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.406]  Here's an update.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.121]  So we know this is going on.
[01:34:05.121 --> 01:34:09.583]  There it is, nurse who originally exposed Cuomo responds to his resignation over sexual harassment.
[01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:14.124]  I think sexual harassment is very bad on a scale of 1 to 10.
[01:34:14.124 --> 01:34:23.948]  I think sending COVID patients into hospitals to kill people on purpose to get high death numbers of 10, I think harassing a woman is like a 2.
[01:34:23.948 --> 01:34:28.750]  But they went after him on that because they didn't want to focus on who gave him the orders.
[01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:31.151]  Who gave the governor of Pennsylvania?
[01:34:32.412 --> 01:34:36.376]  And of Michigan and other Democrat states to do that.
[01:34:36.376 --> 01:34:42.442]  Well, Kate Dolly is a cutting-edge national recognized radio host syndicated all over the country.
[01:34:42.442 --> 01:34:46.926]  KateDollyShow.com, D-A-L-L-E-Y Show.
[01:34:46.926 --> 01:34:53.032]  And her husband went to the doctor and the same type of chain reaction happened.
[01:34:53.032 --> 01:34:54.774]  I've had so many calls where this happens.
[01:34:56.519 --> 01:34:59.882]  And so she's joining us to talk about what happened.
[01:34:59.882 --> 01:35:11.571]  She just went through fighting the CDC COVID-19 protocols in Southern Utah Hospital where her husband was admitted for pneumonia, and she's been really doing a great job telling a firsthand account of what unfolded.
[01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:14.493]  So thanks for joining us to shed some light on this.
[01:35:14.493 --> 01:35:15.374]  Happy to be here.
[01:35:15.374 --> 01:35:16.515]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:35:16.515 --> 01:35:17.476]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:35:17.476 --> 01:35:17.856]  Oh, you bet.
[01:35:17.856 --> 01:35:18.997]  We've only got you for two segments.
[01:35:18.997 --> 01:35:22.159]  I'd love to have you back for a full hour soon, but thanks for coming on on short notice.
[01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:25.542]  Tell us what happened so others are prepared to know what's going on.
[01:35:26.633 --> 01:35:36.837]  Yes, well my husband had pneumonia for about seven days and let me just say as a talk show host I've done nothing but research this for 19 solid months every single day and night.
[01:35:36.837 --> 01:35:42.439]  So I knew a little bit about it as we were going in and I was a little wary of going into the hospital to tell you the truth.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.723]  We went in when his oxygen got to about 79.
[01:35:46.723 --> 01:35:50.347]  It was bad and he couldn't get a breath.
[01:35:50.347 --> 01:35:53.370]  So we went in and were greeted by Nurse Ratched.
[01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:54.351]  I call her Nurse Ratched.
[01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:59.816]  She called security on me for not wanting a mask put on my husband because he couldn't breathe.
[01:35:59.816 --> 01:36:05.202]  You would think that this was something that every medically trained person knew in America, but supposedly not.
[01:36:06.503 --> 01:36:14.211]  So, I think a lot of people in this situation think their mask only works when someone else is wearing one, which makes no sense.
[01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:19.117]  In fact, I'm surprised she didn't waterboard your husband like, oh you can't breathe, here let me just chop your head off.
[01:36:20.279 --> 01:36:21.100]  Right?
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.081]  I couldn't believe it!
[01:36:22.081 --> 01:36:29.350]  And so, we get right into ER, and we're told right away, you know, are you vaccinated?
[01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:31.592]  Oh, you know, this look.
[01:36:31.592 --> 01:36:37.940]  And of course, we want to take a COVID shot, or a COVID test, I'm sorry, and we also want to get x-rays.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:49.587]  So we go in for x-rays, we go in for the shot, I mean for the test, I'm sorry, and of course the test comes back positive because it's ratcheted up to 40 magnifications to be a test of illness.
[01:36:49.587 --> 01:36:52.168]  It's not really a COVID test and people don't get that.
[01:36:52.168 --> 01:36:56.611]  It's just a test of illness and so of course it's going to come back positive.
[01:36:56.611 --> 01:37:01.734]  So it comes back positive and the x-rays come back and it's declared COVID pneumonia.
[01:37:01.734 --> 01:37:03.375]  Just COVID pneumonia, just that quick.
[01:37:03.955 --> 01:37:10.099]  And all of a sudden hazmat suits and the hose coming out of the head and the big huge show.
[01:37:10.099 --> 01:37:12.961]  I mean double masking and everyone just staying awake.
[01:37:12.961 --> 01:37:18.024]  All the big theater, because when it's coated for that, for those who don't know, even USA Today admits $53,000 when they get coated like that.
[01:37:20.595 --> 01:37:21.696]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:21.696 --> 01:37:27.279]  And so we're sitting there and I said, well, what's the difference between COVID pneumonia and pneumonia?
[01:37:27.279 --> 01:37:29.301]  Good old fashioned pneumonia.
[01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:31.882]  And you should have seen the look on the doctor's face.
[01:37:31.882 --> 01:37:33.003]  It was, you have an agenda.
[01:37:33.003 --> 01:37:33.683]  You have an agenda.
[01:37:33.683 --> 01:37:35.404]  And I said, no, I just want to know the difference.
[01:37:35.404 --> 01:37:36.125]  Show me the difference.
[01:37:36.485 --> 01:37:52.993]  So I saw the x-ray photos and it was very, very similar to photos that I then looked up from, I just pulled any numbers out of the hat, 2017, 2006, 2000, and looked at all these different pictures of pneumonia and it's so odd that they're all pretty much the same.
[01:37:52.993 --> 01:37:55.074]  Pneumonia is pneumonia is pneumonia.
[01:37:55.074 --> 01:38:00.637]  And even if they had the argument that something could be a little different, it's still a respiratory illness.
[01:38:00.637 --> 01:38:02.538]  It's still... They say COVID to get the money.
[01:38:03.038 --> 01:38:08.323]  Look, all over the world, governments put a bounty, because the UN is in charge, on saying it's COVID.
[01:38:08.323 --> 01:38:10.945]  So of course, everything's COVID.
[01:38:10.945 --> 01:38:11.546]  Right.
[01:38:11.546 --> 01:38:13.888]  And so then, exactly right.
[01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.410]  And so then, of course, there's two paths.
[01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:22.956]  One is just good old-fashioned pneumonia, where it's not bacterial, so you don't need an antibiotic, it's just viral.
[01:38:22.956 --> 01:38:27.780]  And you go into this part of the hospital over here, you get your oxygen up, you go home, it's chicken soup.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:48.934]  But, with COVID pneumonia, because all pneumonia is gone, all flu is gone, everything else is gone, you know, the last 19 months, now it's COVID pneumonia and that puts you on a high, we were on a high flow oxygen, and this is important, they made a policy change that said that when you're on high flow oxygen, you're not in just a regular room anymore.
[01:38:48.934 --> 01:38:51.095]  Now you are an ICU person.
[01:38:51.095 --> 01:38:56.859]  And that's huge because when they say the ICUs are filled, they're making the policy changes to make that happen.
[01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:58.099]  And people don't realize that.
[01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:58.359]  That's right.
[01:38:58.359 --> 01:39:02.720]  They're listing normal patients as that because they get more money in the coding.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:12.282]  And then my own good, one of my best friends, Rob Dew, thought he had COVID, went in, went to the hospital, and they weren't giving him IV.
[01:39:12.282 --> 01:39:16.102]  They weren't giving him vitamin C. They weren't giving him hydroxychloroquine.
[01:39:16.102 --> 01:39:17.403]  I know that's what you talk about.
[01:39:17.403 --> 01:39:18.363]  They gave him nothing.
[01:39:18.363 --> 01:39:20.723]  He said, well, hell, forget this, and went home, and now he's fine.
[01:39:20.723 --> 01:39:24.544]  But they were literally getting ready to intubate him if he hadn't literally escaped the hospital.
[01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.047]  That's exactly what was going to happen to us.
[01:39:27.047 --> 01:39:29.569]  So from the second we got in, they were saying ventilator.
[01:39:29.569 --> 01:39:34.994]  We weren't even there 30 minutes and they were saying ventilator, be prepared, it's the next step.
[01:39:34.994 --> 01:39:38.897]  And when we said no, we said, I mean, a definite no.
[01:39:38.897 --> 01:39:43.581]  The doctor turned, he's like, it's not your life, it's his life and you'll have brain damage.
[01:39:43.581 --> 01:39:44.862]  You'll have brain damage if you don't do this.
[01:39:45.843 --> 01:39:48.345]  The answer again from us was no.
[01:39:48.345 --> 01:39:50.206]  Hell no, no, and never.
[01:39:50.206 --> 01:39:52.448]  And so we went up to the ICU.
[01:39:52.448 --> 01:39:55.831]  I'm greeted at the door to put on another, yet another gown.
[01:39:55.831 --> 01:39:59.373]  The nurse says, there's COVID infested in your gown.
[01:39:59.373 --> 01:40:02.616]  And I said, but it's not in my shoes, my hair, my clothes.
[01:40:02.616 --> 01:40:03.917]  It's not in anything else.
[01:40:03.917 --> 01:40:05.418]  My husband's bag, nothing else.
[01:40:05.418 --> 01:40:05.918]  It's all theater.
[01:40:05.918 --> 01:40:06.739]  It's all theater.
[01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:18.857]  Yeah, so we go into the ICU and we actually, from the get-go, said, because I'm online with the frontline doctors, I get texts, you know, we're in constant communication, because I've had them on the show.
[01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:20.798]  And I'm saying, you know, what do we do, what do we do?
[01:40:20.798 --> 01:40:30.644]  And it was order, you know, high-dose intravenous vitamin C, high-dose zinc, NAC, all the things you mentioned, right?
[01:40:30.644 --> 01:40:32.826]  And so I said this... Oh, by the way, Rob went home.
[01:40:32.826 --> 01:40:33.826]  He called me at 2 a.m.
[01:40:33.826 --> 01:40:34.247]  last week.
[01:40:34.907 --> 01:40:36.812]  He said they're literally not giving me treatment.
[01:40:36.812 --> 01:40:37.755]  I said leave now.
[01:40:37.755 --> 01:40:42.127]  And I had to get private nurses to go give him vitamin C. He was fine in like 48 hours.
[01:40:43.775 --> 01:40:45.335]  Oh yeah, and so was my husband.
[01:40:45.335 --> 01:40:47.956]  And so when we said these things, they said, that's not our protocol.
[01:40:47.956 --> 01:40:49.376]  And I said, I don't care what your protocol is.
[01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.556]  And they said, well, we don't do that.
[01:40:50.556 --> 01:40:52.477]  And I said, we don't care what you do.
[01:40:52.477 --> 01:40:55.798]  You're going to do these things for my husband or I'll take him out on hospice.
[01:40:55.798 --> 01:40:59.758]  I mean, whatever your choice is, I am not, you're going to do these things.
[01:40:59.758 --> 01:41:01.279]  They acted like I was from Mars.
[01:41:01.279 --> 01:41:06.140]  They acted like I wanted to bring in and treat him like with like good feng shui and voodoo.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:06.480]  I was like,
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.506]  This is vitamin C. Why are you not giving ICU people vitamin C, high dose, because it's proven for inflammation.
[01:41:14.506 --> 01:41:15.026]  It works.
[01:41:15.026 --> 01:41:18.569]  Nucleic acid, all the things in the body, all the mechanisms.
[01:41:18.569 --> 01:41:22.652]  Zinc, NAC, which is an immune helper.
[01:41:22.652 --> 01:41:25.414]  And the point is, this is a giant takeover of medicine.
[01:41:25.414 --> 01:41:27.836]  The Hippocratic Oath hasn't been given for 20 years.
[01:41:27.836 --> 01:41:28.417]  This is criminal.
[01:41:29.827 --> 01:41:31.128]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:41:31.128 --> 01:41:33.849]  And so, I also got Budesonide on our side.
[01:41:33.849 --> 01:41:35.490]  So, they had never used Budesonide.
[01:41:35.490 --> 01:41:36.851]  And I thought, well, why not?
[01:41:36.851 --> 01:41:47.457]  So, the CDC panel from the NIH, from Fauci, gives this 341-page protocol to the hospital administrations.
[01:41:47.457 --> 01:41:49.038]  They give it to the doctors, right?
[01:41:49.038 --> 01:41:55.022]  Well, in the protocol, in the middle of the protocol, page 210, I believe, it talks about Budenazide.
[01:41:55.362 --> 01:41:55.682]  We're good.
[01:42:13.252 --> 01:42:20.661]  Interestingly enough, you get a mambudisonide and in the study it even says that this will keep them out of the hospital.
[01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:29.811]  The findings were really quite stunning because it actually says on the findings that it keeps them from getting worse, right?
[01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:30.752]  It keeps them out of the hospital.
[01:42:31.332 --> 01:42:34.675]  And so, but we can't recommend it because the study was too small.
[01:42:34.675 --> 01:42:36.477]  And I went, yeah, that's not a thing.
[01:42:36.477 --> 01:42:38.238]  So you're going to do that.
[01:42:38.238 --> 01:42:41.221]  All right, Kate Dolly, stay there.
[01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:43.543]  We're going to come back because this is huge.
[01:42:43.543 --> 01:42:53.151]  And again, this is technocracy now where the big tech and the media is in control of what any of us can say, including doctors, and then they deny people care to then take control of us and kill us.
[01:42:53.151 --> 01:42:55.573]  I mean, this is what technocracy can do.
[01:42:55.573 --> 01:42:56.794]  The new dark ages.
[01:42:56.794 --> 01:42:57.775]  We're fighting back against it.
[01:42:59.147 --> 01:43:05.570]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:12.954]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[01:43:12.954 --> 01:43:14.275]  Consuming too much fluoride
[01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:15.236]  We're good to go!
[01:43:36.031 --> 01:43:37.192]  What are champions made of?
[01:44:04.373 --> 01:44:05.502]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:44:12.077 --> 01:44:13.598]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:44:13.598 --> 01:44:15.520]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:16.841]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:44:16.841 --> 01:44:17.982]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!

[01:44:46.167 --> 01:44:46.367]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:44:46.367 --> 01:44:47.288]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:00.114 --> 01:45:02.495]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[01:45:02.495 --> 01:45:04.235]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:45:04.235 --> 01:45:07.216]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:45:07.216 --> 01:45:08.477]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:45:08.477 --> 01:45:09.397]  But I don't care about that.
[01:45:09.397 --> 01:45:11.438]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:16.140]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:19.501]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:21.021]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:45:21.021 --> 01:45:22.222]  But let's just say this.
[01:45:22.222 --> 01:45:23.542]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:45:23.542 --> 01:45:25.983]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:45:26.623 --> 01:45:30.264]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:45:30.264 --> 01:45:32.825]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.

[01:45:36.026 --> 01:45:36.866]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:45:36.866 --> 01:45:37.987]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:45:37.987 --> 01:45:44.429]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:45:44.429 --> 01:45:45.849]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:49.572]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:45:49.572 --> 01:45:52.694]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.

[01:46:32.102 --> 01:46:34.623]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[01:46:34.623 --> 01:46:38.024]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.884]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:46:39.884 --> 01:46:41.945]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:46:41.945 --> 01:46:45.266]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[01:46:45.646 --> 01:46:48.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:14.329 --> 01:47:18.391]  Kate Daly is our guest and syndicated talk show host.
[01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:28.496]  She tells the same story that hundreds of thousands have told, where they have to save their mothers, their daughters, their husbands, their brothers, their cousins, where you go into the hospital
[01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:31.491]  And they won't give you the regular treatments for pneumonia.
[01:47:31.491 --> 01:47:35.432]  They just say, come right over here, we need to give you a ventilator.
[01:47:35.432 --> 01:47:39.914]  Remember what Governor Cuomo said, ventilators, ventilators, ventilators.
[01:47:39.914 --> 01:47:46.816]  But then if you're having an autoimmune response in your lungs, which is what this virus really does, now the vaccine's even worse, the studies show.
[01:47:46.816 --> 01:47:48.297]  You need steroids.
[01:47:48.297 --> 01:47:49.077]  You need water.
[01:47:49.077 --> 01:47:51.158]  You need vitamin C. You need what your cells need.
[01:47:52.517 --> 01:47:55.838]  Because if you flood your cells with all these vitamins and minerals, the viruses can't even get in.
[01:47:55.838 --> 01:47:58.459]  Your cells are basically wanting that.
[01:47:58.459 --> 01:48:02.620]  They'll open up and engorge themselves with all the good stuff.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:11.522]  The B12, the vitamin C, the vitamin D, the zinc, the calcium, the iodine.
[01:48:11.522 --> 01:48:12.783]  Nobody ever talks about that.
[01:48:12.783 --> 01:48:13.803]  The clean water.
[01:48:14.918 --> 01:48:16.500]  And so, start over.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.561]  This is amazing.
[01:48:17.561 --> 01:48:18.982]  Because you're a well-spoken person.
[01:48:18.982 --> 01:48:21.645]  We don't always, you know, have people that want to go on air and talk about this.
[01:48:21.645 --> 01:48:26.430]  This happened to a well-spoken, smart lady with a national talk show.
[01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:31.856]  So you're there, Kate, and you're in the middle of this, and you're watching what they're doing.
[01:48:31.856 --> 01:48:32.437]  Please continue.
[01:48:33.439 --> 01:48:40.423]  Okay, so the two things that bothered me were, number one, I was told ventilator from the second we walked in the door, which really bothered me.
[01:48:40.423 --> 01:48:43.265]  Why were they pushing the idea and prepping us for that?
[01:48:43.265 --> 01:48:46.447]  The other thing was they told us we'd be there seven to ten days.
[01:48:46.447 --> 01:48:51.450]  Once they declared COVID pneumonia, it was seven to ten days and I thought, do you have a crystal ball?
[01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:55.232]  You know, why aren't you just saying let's admit him overnight and see how he does?
[01:48:55.232 --> 01:48:58.294]  And I asked about it and they said it was protocol.
[01:48:58.294 --> 01:48:59.395]  Again, with the protocol.
[01:48:59.995 --> 01:49:02.899]  And so their protocol is what is killing people.
[01:49:02.899 --> 01:49:04.080]  It is not COVID.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.306]  And that's really the main message is it is the protocol that they're following.
[01:49:09.306 --> 01:49:14.413]  I know that there are good doctors and nurses because I relied on good doctors and nurses to help me through this.
[01:49:14.913 --> 01:49:17.594]  But for the most part, they're just taking orders.
[01:49:17.594 --> 01:49:22.216]  So that's the problem, is they hold tight to this, but they don't read, they don't study.
[01:49:22.216 --> 01:49:28.658]  The doctors, I found, did not know what they were really doing with this whole elusive mystery thing.
[01:49:28.658 --> 01:49:34.381]  And when I started asking questions like, well, you know, why do you have this protocol?
[01:49:34.381 --> 01:49:38.562]  And they kept telling me, well, this is the best protocol based on the best studies.
[01:49:38.562 --> 01:49:41.824]  And I said, well, I've done a lot of research, so I probably read the studies.
[01:49:41.824 --> 01:49:42.124]  Which ones?
[01:49:43.064 --> 01:49:46.087]  And they said, well, they're just good.
[01:49:46.087 --> 01:49:46.727]  They're just good.
[01:49:46.727 --> 01:49:48.028]  So they couldn't answer it.
[01:49:48.028 --> 01:49:55.814]  The other thing was going up into the ICU, we had to be constantly vigilant at making sure they were actually doing what we asked.
[01:49:55.814 --> 01:50:00.478]  First, they put him on like a, you know, one of those dissolvable vitamin C's orally.
[01:50:00.478 --> 01:50:09.946]  And I'm like, no, he needs high intravenous vitamin C. There's a reason you do high intravenous because at high rates, it can even kill cancer cells.
[01:50:09.946 --> 01:50:11.287]  We know this through all the studies.
[01:50:11.827 --> 01:50:15.109]  By the way, there's a Nobel Prize on that with Elias Pauling.
[01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:16.430]  You didn't just say that.
[01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:18.692]  The Twitter will say, oh that's banned, that's not true.
[01:50:18.692 --> 01:50:19.892]  No, that's a fact.
[01:50:19.892 --> 01:50:21.433]  Keep going.
[01:50:21.433 --> 01:50:34.082]  Yeah, so on page 341, or towards the end, I think it's like 296, something like that, towards the end of the protocol, this big monstrous protocol that the NIH wrote for all the hospitals, this is all the hospitals,
[01:50:34.962 --> 01:50:39.486]  At the very end, I think it's for legal reasons, because they have to say, well, we looked at these things.
[01:50:39.486 --> 01:50:46.612]  So it says vitamin C, it says zinc, it says all of the things, butadenite, all of the things that we gave my husband, right?
[01:50:46.612 --> 01:50:48.733]  Because we didn't want to do their protocol.
[01:50:48.733 --> 01:50:51.936]  And at the end it says, all of these things, insufficient data.
[01:50:52.496 --> 01:50:53.657]  Insufficient data.
[01:50:53.657 --> 01:50:56.738]  And I'm thinking vitamin C insufficient data, really?
[01:50:56.738 --> 01:50:57.318]  I don't think so.
[01:50:57.318 --> 01:51:10.083]  And for those who don't know, if they allow in the hundreds of proven great things that work from ivermectin to hydroxychloroquine to vitamin C and vitamin D and steroids, then they don't get to push an experimental Franken shot.
[01:51:10.083 --> 01:51:14.444]  That's how they got the authorization for emergency authorization, which is so ongoing.
[01:51:16.499 --> 01:51:20.382]  You're exactly right, because they can't push a vaccine if they have things that work.
[01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:21.643]  Bottom line, right?
[01:51:21.643 --> 01:51:27.787]  And so they have to shove all of that to the end of the report and say it's not conclusive, don't do that, but let's do all the junk.
[01:51:27.787 --> 01:51:31.930]  Let's do all, like, Radev, uh, what is it called, uh, Radezemvir?
[01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:33.671]  Uh, the one that causes renal damage.
[01:51:34.531 --> 01:51:35.332]  Kidney damage.
[01:51:35.332 --> 01:51:40.456]  Let's try all the stuff that we know is dangerous and then put all the good stuff at the very, very back.
[01:51:40.456 --> 01:51:43.219]  Because you and I both know, pneumonia is pneumonia is pneumonia.
[01:51:43.219 --> 01:51:45.921]  You're going to treat it in a very similar way.
[01:51:45.921 --> 01:51:49.704]  But what they've done is created a circus show out of this whole thing.
[01:51:49.704 --> 01:51:54.968]  And it's the masks and the hazmat suits and then when you go in, it's a whole different track at the hospital.
[01:51:54.968 --> 01:51:56.550]  A whole different track of dollars.
[01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:57.891]  You know, they get paid for all of this.
[01:51:58.371 --> 01:52:00.572]  And then, of course, it's to keep them in there.
[01:52:00.572 --> 01:52:04.093]  And so what they do is they watch them decline, decline, decline.
[01:52:04.093 --> 01:52:09.294]  They stick them on a ventilator and then they wring their hands and they say, COVID killed them.
[01:52:09.294 --> 01:52:09.975]  It's all COVID.
[01:52:09.975 --> 01:52:11.075]  And they're crying in the cameras.
[01:52:11.075 --> 01:52:11.595]  It's COVID.
[01:52:11.595 --> 01:52:12.235]  Go get the shot.
[01:52:12.235 --> 01:52:13.115]  Go get the shot.
[01:52:13.115 --> 01:52:16.376]  This has nothing to do with being vaxxed or unvaxxed.
[01:52:16.376 --> 01:52:17.997]  You're going to get the same damn protocol.
[01:52:18.675 --> 01:52:21.918]  You're going to get the horrible protocol no matter what you are.
[01:52:21.918 --> 01:52:24.620]  And so, we blow a hole right through that story anyway.
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:28.603]  This is why New York Times is not flying to come to my house to interview me.
[01:52:28.603 --> 01:52:31.966]  They're only doing the regret vaccine stories.
[01:52:31.966 --> 01:52:32.747]  Oh, I regret.
[01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:33.428]  You see it.
[01:52:33.428 --> 01:52:37.031]  CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, just everywhere.
[01:52:37.031 --> 01:52:41.795]  And they go in and videotape some poor guy they want to give treatment to on a ventilator.
[01:52:41.795 --> 01:52:43.036]  It's amazing.
[01:52:43.036 --> 01:52:43.916]  That's exactly right.
[01:52:43.916 --> 01:52:45.037]  How's your husband doing now?
[01:52:45.037 --> 01:52:46.779]  Tell us the rest of the story in the hospital.
[01:52:47.574 --> 01:52:57.304]  Within 35 hours, 30 hours, he was sitting in a chair, walking to the bathroom, eating Thai food, watching movies, doing great, laughing, talking.
[01:52:57.304 --> 01:53:00.628]  And the doc came in and said, oh my gosh, you're doing better than anyone on the floor.
[01:53:00.628 --> 01:53:01.569]  And I'm thinking, yeah, think?
[01:53:02.682 --> 01:53:11.349]  And so, why don't you look at this as something that you guys should do, instead of an anomaly or anecdotal, and you know that's what they're going to do, right?
[01:53:11.349 --> 01:53:16.572]  So, even though he had four risk factors even going in, right?
[01:53:16.572 --> 01:53:21.296]  So, he should be dead, really, truly, in their eyes.
[01:53:21.296 --> 01:53:24.058]  He was out, and he could have been out in three days.
[01:53:24.058 --> 01:53:25.559]  It went three and a half days.
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.823]  And I said, well, why do you want to still keep him?
[01:53:28.823 --> 01:53:29.884]  I mean, he could leave right now.
[01:53:29.884 --> 01:53:32.968]  This is kind of ridiculous, in the ICU anyway.
[01:53:32.968 --> 01:53:35.411]  And they said, well, didn't he have sleep apnea at some point?
[01:53:35.411 --> 01:53:37.194]  And I'm thinking, like 12 years ago?
[01:53:37.194 --> 01:53:38.015]  Yeah, okay.
[01:53:38.015 --> 01:53:40.217]  So now you need to be in the hospital for sleep apnea.
[01:53:40.217 --> 01:53:41.199]  So let's talk about that.
[01:53:41.199 --> 01:53:42.380]  Rob, dude.
[01:53:43.497 --> 01:53:53.602]  One of the oldest employees here, great guy, got really sick, and they went in and said, well, not COVID, but we're going to say it's COVID, we're going to say it's COVID pneumonia, even though he tested not positive.
[01:53:53.602 --> 01:53:55.582]  And then all of a sudden, they would give him nothing.
[01:53:55.582 --> 01:53:57.763]  No IV, no medicine, no nothing.
[01:53:57.763 --> 01:54:03.106]  He said, screw this, because we got him in touch with that famous doctor from Texas who's on next week.
[01:54:03.666 --> 01:54:06.927]  And I said, you need to get up, you need to get out, you need to take steroids, you need to leave.
[01:54:06.927 --> 01:54:08.748]  He went and did that, Phil's fine now.
[01:54:08.748 --> 01:54:10.409]  He's like doing two mile walks today.
[01:54:10.409 --> 01:54:15.351]  It was just in the hospital a few days ago, so literally he'd probably be dead if they had him still in there.
[01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:17.551]  He walked out in flip-flops.
[01:54:17.551 --> 01:54:18.052]  And you know what?
[01:54:18.052 --> 01:54:18.892]  They didn't like it.
[01:54:18.892 --> 01:54:20.633]  And a couple of them, I think, are still angry.
[01:54:20.633 --> 01:54:22.233]  I don't know, angry that he didn't die?
[01:54:22.233 --> 01:54:25.094]  I mean, that's how sickening this is getting.
[01:54:25.094 --> 01:54:27.515]  They are holding so fast to this protocol.
[01:54:27.515 --> 01:54:28.696]  They don't study.
[01:54:28.696 --> 01:54:29.616]  They don't look.
[01:54:29.616 --> 01:54:30.517]  They don't read.
[01:54:30.517 --> 01:54:33.978]  And I know that because I do on a daily basis.
[01:54:33.978 --> 01:54:38.320]  And I felt like, and this isn't to boast, I just felt like I knew more about this.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.621]  And I knew that they were trying to say it was mysterious and elusive.
[01:54:41.621 --> 01:54:44.242]  Every time they came in the room, it was mysterious and elusive.
[01:54:44.582 --> 01:54:47.023]  And I'm thinking, honey, it's been 19 months.
[01:54:47.023 --> 01:54:49.484]  This is not some sort of mystery.
[01:54:49.484 --> 01:54:50.445]  It's pneumonia.
[01:54:50.445 --> 01:54:54.487]  Because you can't have COVID flu, COVID pneumonia, COVID cold.
[01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.987]  It can't be all things.
[01:54:55.987 --> 01:54:56.828]  It can't be all symptoms.
[01:54:56.828 --> 01:54:58.268]  There's something in that code to get more money.
[01:54:58.268 --> 01:55:00.689]  And remember, the hospitals were empty last year.
[01:55:00.689 --> 01:55:01.510]  My concern is...
[01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:07.494]  With the sloughing of the virus from the vaccines, the studies show it actually makes people infected.
[01:55:07.494 --> 01:55:12.598]  I'm actually seeing hospitals get full now, and doctors I trust say it's starting to happen.
[01:55:12.598 --> 01:55:18.102]  In Israel, 95% of the new cases are the vaccinated, including the deaths.
[01:55:18.102 --> 01:55:19.103]  Same thing in Australia.
[01:55:19.103 --> 01:55:26.329]  Australia is only 27% inoculated with this garbage, but 99% of people in the hospital have had the shot.
[01:55:26.329 --> 01:55:29.251]  So this is, what do you think the big picture is here?
[01:55:30.239 --> 01:55:37.821]  I think the big picture is the protocol is killing people and people aren't realizing it because they're hearing it from trusted doctors and nurses that are saying COVID's doing it.
[01:55:37.821 --> 01:55:42.142]  And now that I've peeked behind the curtain to see Oz, now I get why.
[01:55:42.142 --> 01:55:49.524]  And I realize that they really didn't know what they were doing and they did it all as this circus show, and I don't think a lot of them mean to do it.
[01:55:49.524 --> 01:55:52.865]  I think there's really good doctors and nurses out there.
[01:55:52.865 --> 01:55:57.626]  Oh, no doubt the people following the protocol are following a script and don't know, but what about
[01:55:58.126 --> 01:56:02.809]  What about Fauci and Milgates and the people that wrote the script worldwide?
[01:56:02.809 --> 01:56:12.076]  When the head epidemiologist from China was on CBS News and said we don't have a sample of COVID and they never asked a single question about that.
[01:56:12.076 --> 01:56:17.120]  When the CDC came out last September and said we don't have a sample in their own report
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.782]  Isn't everybody alarmed by that?
[01:56:19.782 --> 01:56:22.965]  I remember going back, I've been talking about this 19 months on my show, right?
[01:56:22.965 --> 01:56:24.146]  Every single day.
[01:56:24.146 --> 01:56:35.355]  And clear back in February 9th, I took screenshots of the European stats on flu because the chart went like this and literally dropped on February 9th.
[01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.076]  They stopped counting the flu.
[01:56:37.076 --> 01:56:38.257]  We stopped counting the flu.
[01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:40.820]  They were putting everything in that column.
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:44.483]  This is industrial level fraud by psychotic criminals.
[01:56:45.043 --> 01:56:49.487]  Alright, well Kate, Dolly, I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:56:49.487 --> 01:56:54.172]  KateDollyShow.com, like Valley but with a D. Amazing.
[01:56:54.172 --> 01:56:56.054]  Come back with us and give us more updates.
[01:56:56.054 --> 01:56:58.836]  Just in 30 seconds though, how's your husband doing now?
[01:56:58.836 --> 01:56:59.677]  He's doing fine.
[01:56:59.677 --> 01:57:06.463]  He's doing fantastic and I'm so happy to have him home and we just want to help save some lives and that's why I decided to share our personal story with us.
[01:57:06.463 --> 01:57:08.425]  Well I appreciate you sharing because the numbers are out.
[01:57:08.425 --> 01:57:10.027]  Half of those put on ventilators died.
[01:57:10.919 --> 01:57:13.041]  Yes, actually up to 80% now.
[01:57:13.041 --> 01:57:14.622]  So I wouldn't do it.
[01:57:14.622 --> 01:57:15.884]  I refuse the ventilator.
[01:57:15.884 --> 01:57:19.567]  We refuse, refuse, and they said, you refuse?
[01:57:19.567 --> 01:57:20.668]  Like this was from Mars.
[01:57:20.668 --> 01:57:22.870]  And I said, yeah, you're not putting them on a ventilator.
[01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:25.673]  We're the kind of family who's, yeah, we're not, we're not doing that.
[01:57:26.013 --> 01:57:34.099]  The ventilators are the new French Revolution guillotines of the left, and they have moron idiots who work at hospitals that follow protocol doing it.
[01:57:34.099 --> 01:57:35.180]  Thank you, Kate.
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:36.041]  Allie, thank you.
[01:57:36.041 --> 01:57:36.821]  All right.
[01:57:36.821 --> 01:57:37.682]  Boom!
[01:57:37.682 --> 01:57:43.787]  Mike Adams with a ton of breaking news and so much more joins me in the third hour.
[01:57:43.787 --> 01:57:45.188]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:45.188 --> 01:57:46.449]  For everybody you know, tune in now.
[01:57:49.138 --> 01:57:54.381]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Super Sale.
[01:57:54.381 --> 01:58:00.205]  And we have the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium, 50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[01:58:00.205 --> 01:58:04.268]  Vitamin C, Zinc, and Rosehips, very strong formula.
[01:58:04.268 --> 01:58:06.950]  This is 50% off at Infolwerestore.com.
[01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:09.833]  Now back in stock, just came back in yesterday.
[01:58:09.833 --> 01:58:13.157]  Very powerful, pure turmeric extract tincture.
[01:58:13.157 --> 01:58:17.041]  Not a true immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[01:58:17.041 --> 01:58:20.505]  And then, sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:58:20.505 --> 01:58:24.129]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint.
[01:58:24.129 --> 01:58:28.614]  And so much more, back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash.
[01:58:28.814 --> 01:58:29.475]  We're good to go.
[01:58:50.131 --> 01:58:53.956]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[01:58:53.956 --> 01:58:55.198]  I was overweight.
[01:58:55.198 --> 01:58:57.441]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[01:58:57.441 --> 01:58:59.403]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[01:58:59.403 --> 01:59:01.887]  And I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[01:59:01.887 --> 01:59:04.630]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[01:59:05.191 --> 01:59:06.412]  And it worked pretty good.
[01:59:06.412 --> 01:59:11.815]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[01:59:11.815 --> 01:59:12.455]  So I took it.
[01:59:12.455 --> 01:59:18.759]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[01:59:18.759 --> 01:59:22.040]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:28.424]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:59:28.424 --> 01:59:30.805]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:59:30.805 --> 01:59:31.886]  The one I like recently
[01:59:31.926 --> 01:59:33.727]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.267 --> 02:00:12.031]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[02:00:12.031 --> 02:00:17.674]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[02:00:17.674 --> 02:00:21.296]  And no one, but nobody wants to know him.
[02:00:21.296 --> 02:00:23.637]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[02:00:24.434 --> 02:00:28.257]  But the fool.
[02:00:28.257 --> 02:00:40.365]  But the fool on the hill.
[02:00:40.365 --> 02:00:43.007]  Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:00:43.007 --> 02:00:45.388]  Look forward to the interview with him.
[02:00:45.388 --> 02:00:51.713]  But I was just sitting back realizing I've just done two hours of live radio and I have not plugged one time.
[02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:56.293]  And for folks that tune into regular radio, you know, they plug every segment.
[02:00:56.293 --> 02:00:59.555]  So let's talk about that right now.
[02:00:59.555 --> 02:01:02.998]  Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot operate without you funding us.
[02:01:02.998 --> 02:01:04.279]  And I'm not coming to you bitching.
[02:01:04.279 --> 02:01:05.520]  We've done incredible things.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.081]  You've done incredible things.
[02:01:07.081 --> 02:01:08.202]  The world is waking up.
[02:01:08.202 --> 02:01:14.687]  We weren't supposed to be on air in the middle of 2021 during this globalist depopulation attack.
[02:01:14.687 --> 02:01:21.011]  But thanks to your incredible will and word of mouth and prayer and financial support, we're here.
[02:01:21.011 --> 02:01:21.292]  And so,
[02:01:22.628 --> 02:01:27.255]  I've just done two hours of live radio and have not plugged one time, and that's my fault.
[02:01:27.255 --> 02:01:29.679]  When I plug at least once or twice an hour, we can fund ourselves.
[02:01:29.679 --> 02:01:37.130]  When I don't, we're close to being shut down under the very same attacks, the very same groups that are going after Mike Lindell and others.
[02:01:38.746 --> 02:01:38.886]  I don't
[02:02:00.006 --> 02:02:02.309]  Mouthwash for all the essential oils that folks love.
[02:02:02.309 --> 02:02:03.851]  That's back in stock.
[02:02:03.851 --> 02:02:06.935]  And we have the new Liquid Turmeric Concentrate Extract.
[02:02:06.935 --> 02:02:08.637]  Just like bodies, but liquid.
[02:02:08.637 --> 02:02:09.758]  It's 50% off.
[02:02:09.758 --> 02:02:12.922]  Vitamin D3 with calcium.
[02:02:12.922 --> 02:02:13.443]  It's 50% off.
[02:02:13.443 --> 02:02:14.224]  Vitamin C with zinc.
[02:02:14.224 --> 02:02:16.246]  1100% of vitamin C. It's life-spawning.
[02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:20.767]  We're good to go.
[02:02:33.490 --> 02:02:40.634]  For 50% off with 11 free bumper stickers to spread the word, including the big door sticker that says, no contact tracers here.
[02:02:40.634 --> 02:02:42.716]  That's like, cost us almost a dollar, that sticker.
[02:02:42.716 --> 02:02:44.377]  That is $14.95.
[02:02:44.377 --> 02:02:49.640]  So a privacy pouch to protect your identity from contact tracers, the Faraday cage, droids, androids.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:50.481]  It works great.
[02:02:50.481 --> 02:02:52.562]  Has great reviews.
[02:02:52.562 --> 02:02:55.404]  You can get all the stickers with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:56.434 --> 02:02:59.357]  For $14.95, that funds the operation.
[02:02:59.357 --> 02:03:05.064]  And then, separately, we have X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, the good halogen.
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.141]  That is it for your stamina, your libido.
[02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:09.781]  That's all important.
[02:03:09.781 --> 02:03:11.001]  What about immune system?
[02:03:11.001 --> 02:03:11.661]  It's essential.
[02:03:11.661 --> 02:03:12.581]  You have to have it.
[02:03:12.581 --> 02:03:15.382]  And it's Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, truly atomic.
[02:03:15.382 --> 02:03:22.684]  That is 50% off, even though I'm very, very close to selling out because the good news is more is coming early next month.
[02:03:22.684 --> 02:03:24.945]  So I want to just sell out of it at 50% off.
[02:03:24.945 --> 02:03:26.605]  Stock up on that today.
[02:03:26.605 --> 02:03:30.046]  It's so hard to get products in with the lockdowns, with the garbage that's going on.
[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:35.615]  Thank God a lot of products have come back in, including the activated charcoal toothpaste.
[02:03:35.615 --> 02:03:38.478]  We also have the great camouflage in navy blue and black.
[02:03:38.478 --> 02:03:40.941]  Free American flag that's so triggering to leftists.
[02:03:40.941 --> 02:03:42.603]  It helps you meet like-minded patriots.
[02:03:42.603 --> 02:03:44.846]  It says InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:03:44.846 --> 02:03:48.811]  Those shirts are discounted at InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[02:03:48.811 --> 02:03:50.032]  But whatever you do,
[02:03:51.266 --> 02:04:00.153]  Realize that the people's mind is open now, like a field with good fertilizer and good soil and seeds and sunshine and rain.
[02:04:00.153 --> 02:04:07.659]  Now is the time to take the articles and the videos that you think are most important from freeworldnews.tv or band.video.
[02:04:07.659 --> 02:04:10.522]  Freeworldnews.tv isn't censored yet on Twitter and Facebook and places.
[02:04:11.282 --> 02:04:15.823]  It probably will be soon, but it's just a copy URL of everything at Bandot Video, and share it.
[02:04:15.823 --> 02:04:22.725]  And you've been doing that, and so InfoWars.com and Bandot Video are growing exponentially.
[02:04:22.725 --> 02:04:32.088]  I love paying the $150,000, $200,000 bills each month for bandwidth, even though it's hard to pay those, because it's a sign of our victory.
[02:04:32.088 --> 02:04:33.309]  We stayed on air.
[02:04:33.309 --> 02:04:34.649]  They weren't able to shut us down.
[02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:36.451]  And it's just growing exponentially.
[02:04:36.451 --> 02:04:37.932]  And that's just on those videos.
[02:04:37.932 --> 02:04:39.373]  People are clipping clips out.
[02:04:39.373 --> 02:04:40.074]  They're sharing them.
[02:04:40.074 --> 02:04:42.176]  They're putting them on their own channels.
[02:04:42.176 --> 02:04:43.438]  It's beautiful.
[02:04:43.438 --> 02:04:45.620]  So you are the resistance.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.722]  Band.Video, FreeWorldNews.TV.
[02:04:47.722 --> 02:04:48.863]  Share those articles.
[02:04:48.863 --> 02:04:49.824]  Pray for us.
[02:04:49.824 --> 02:04:53.728]  And buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:05:08.171 --> 02:05:16.277]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a bestseller within six months, and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[02:05:16.277 --> 02:05:19.499]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply.
[02:05:19.499 --> 02:05:20.519]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[02:05:20.519 --> 02:05:22.441]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:25.643]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you're already a fan or if you haven't tried it,
[02:05:26.363 --> 02:05:29.086]  It's back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:29.086 --> 02:05:35.553]  Discounted because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[02:05:35.553 --> 02:05:41.358]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places.
[02:05:41.358 --> 02:05:46.504]  InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:05:46.504 --> 02:05:49.547]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.

[02:06:05.335 --> 02:06:07.676]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.676 --> 02:06:09.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.227 --> 02:06:29.556]  If you want my actual worldview, I believe that we're at war, and that this is a takedown of Western civilization, if not humanity, so that it's an attack on us as humans against... I mean, they're coming after us, they're coming after our children, and they want us dead or sterilized.
[02:06:29.556 --> 02:06:33.358]  And we can argue that they are, but I think it's not necessarily a nation-state war.
[02:06:33.358 --> 02:06:34.599]  This is a fifth-generation
[02:06:35.399 --> 02:06:35.699]  Thank you.
[02:06:52.626 --> 02:06:55.648]  You're using poisons, you're using genetic agents.
[02:06:55.648 --> 02:07:00.712]  It's not characteristic warfare where you have a battlefield and you have an army and we can see what's going on.
[02:07:00.712 --> 02:07:02.813]  Part of this is the psychological operation.
[02:07:02.813 --> 02:07:10.959]  There's clearly been a psychological operation that has gotten the American people are getting their children vaccinated with something that's totally experimental.
[02:07:10.959 --> 02:07:14.222]  That's a symptom of some psychological illness.
[02:07:14.222 --> 02:07:15.443]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:07:15.443 --> 02:07:16.744]  They've created this.
[02:07:16.744 --> 02:07:19.726]  And so I think that's my world view is that this is not by accident.
[02:07:19.726 --> 02:07:21.187]  And they want us dead or sterilized.
[02:07:22.893 --> 02:07:29.084]  This virus is a man-made gain-of-function virus paid for by U.S.
[02:07:29.084 --> 02:07:33.671]  taxpayers' dollars, including monies that came from the Department of Defense.
[02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:39.137]  This is a bioweapon, by every definition.
[02:07:39.137 --> 02:07:46.362]  And by every definition, their having developed this is a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty.
[02:07:46.362 --> 02:07:55.768]  Dr. Mengele right now is rolling over in his grave, thinking, wondering why he could not have the capacity to do this type of human manipulation.
[02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:59.330]  And right now, right now, this vaccine rollout,
[02:08:00.271 --> 02:08:05.052]  This is the largest research project conducted in the history of mankind.
[02:08:05.052 --> 02:08:09.714]  You are either part of the experimental group or part of the control group.
[02:08:09.714 --> 02:08:23.778]  For anybody to be forcing or coercing anybody to take this vaccine, when if you look at the numbers on these vaccines, they do not statistically reduce your risk of coming down with a diagnosis of COVID or killing you.
[02:08:23.778 --> 02:08:26.819]  When you go through the EUA documents, you will find
[02:08:27.799 --> 02:08:39.386]  That those are the people who do not get diagnosed and there is no statistically significant difference for the people who got the Pfizer vaccine versus people who didn't get vaccinated at seven days.
[02:08:39.386 --> 02:08:56.836]  For the people who got the Moderna vaccine and who didn't at 14 days and for the Janssen group at seven or at 14 days there was a slight difference but by 28 days that difference was gone and there's no difference in deaths and in fact the Janssen data is based upon the incorrect data
[02:08:57.276 --> 02:09:06.322]  If you read through the EUA, because if you go to the following table, you will find out that the numbers that they use to get approval are not the centrally confirmed lab numbers.
[02:09:06.322 --> 02:09:13.928]  They use the peripheral labs, but those numbers were not confirmed by the central core lab, which is what you do when you have a research project.
[02:09:13.928 --> 02:09:17.150]  A central place that says yes, no.
[02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:22.354]  The central core numbers don't even show benefit at 14 days.
[02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:23.935]  This is a biological weapon.
[02:09:26.514 --> 02:09:33.541]  And Dr. Michael Fleming will be joining us with Mike Adams hosting in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[02:09:33.541 --> 02:09:37.605]  So coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes or so.
[02:09:38.891 --> 02:09:39.852]  Mike Adams joins us.
[02:09:39.852 --> 02:09:45.196]  He'll be co-hosting and hosting coming up in the third hour and the fourth hour today.
[02:09:45.196 --> 02:09:50.741]  I'm going to leave you in an hour because I'm a busy beaver with technical things and business things and funding operations.
[02:09:50.741 --> 02:09:52.182]  They're just as critical as us being on air.
[02:09:52.182 --> 02:09:52.903]  I'd rather be on air.
[02:09:52.903 --> 02:09:54.504]  That's the most important thing.
[02:09:54.504 --> 02:09:56.866]  Mike Adams stepping up to the plate.
[02:09:56.866 --> 02:09:59.288]  Speaking of Mike Adams, that was an interview on his show.
[02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:06.252]  That we just played before that last clip with Dr. Lee Merritt, who I really want to get on, who is just so on target.
[02:10:06.252 --> 02:10:10.094]  She's saying the same thing I'm saying, because we're seeing the same attack.
[02:10:10.094 --> 02:10:13.796]  Mike Adams, so much to cover, so much to get into.
[02:10:13.796 --> 02:10:16.298]  I don't even know where to start.
[02:10:16.298 --> 02:10:22.761]  California saying, yeah, you've got to have shots to even go in a grocery store, just like France.
[02:10:22.761 --> 02:10:27.964]  Austin, businesses, restaurants, announcing hotels, got a habit to come in these.
[02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:30.991]  They are really making their move.
[02:10:30.991 --> 02:10:33.192]  Remember, you and I said this was coming years ago.
[02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:33.952]  We were crazy.
[02:10:33.952 --> 02:10:34.593]  Now it's here.
[02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:37.374]  So, so much to cover.
[02:10:37.374 --> 02:10:38.155]  So much to break down.
[02:10:38.155 --> 02:10:41.876]  What are you going to cover in the next 50 minutes while we're co-hosting together?
[02:10:41.876 --> 02:10:44.558]  And then what's coming up when you do the fourth hour today?
[02:10:45.134 --> 02:10:49.077]  Well, I've connected some dots here about the military mandatory vaccines.
[02:10:49.077 --> 02:10:51.599]  I want to share that with you here in the next few minutes.
[02:10:51.599 --> 02:10:57.724]  Also, we've been able to get Dr. Richard Fleming to join us at the bottom of this hour.
[02:10:57.724 --> 02:10:59.566]  If that's all right with you, he's available.
[02:10:59.566 --> 02:11:01.027]  Oh, is this hour?
[02:11:01.027 --> 02:11:02.128]  Good, great, great, wonderful.
[02:11:02.762 --> 02:11:07.367]  Yeah, yeah, and this is one of the most brilliant people I've ever interviewed.
[02:11:07.367 --> 02:11:09.930]  He's a nuclear cardiologist.
[02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:11.091]  He's trained as a physicist.
[02:11:11.091 --> 02:11:12.472]  He's a Ph.D.
[02:11:12.472 --> 02:11:13.373]  and an M.D.
[02:11:13.373 --> 02:11:24.686]  doctor, and he's been able to trace the entire origins of this bioweapon, the spike protein bioweapon, and he confirms that this bioweapon is in the vaccines, and so he's also an expert on inflammation.
[02:11:25.226 --> 02:11:32.750]  So he's got information about how people can reduce their systemic inflammation in order to halt long-term effects.
[02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:42.736]  If someone has made a mistake and taken one of these vaccines, or even two vaccines, there's still a way to save yourself, and you don't have to go down the road of... Oh wow, that's the Holy Grail.
[02:11:42.736 --> 02:11:43.737]  Does he only have 30 minutes?
[02:11:45.225 --> 02:11:46.446]  No, he's got more than 30 minutes.
[02:11:46.446 --> 02:11:48.187]  I think we're going to carry him into the fourth hour.
[02:11:48.187 --> 02:11:53.870]  I'm going to leave early then, because I want to let you go with this, because you're good at being quiet, unlike I am.
[02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:58.932]  So let's cover the time we have right now, then what else is happening, because, man, things are moving quick.
[02:11:58.932 --> 02:12:01.274]  OK, here's what I want to bring up right now.
[02:12:02.214 --> 02:12:07.479]  About the military and the mandatory vaccines, understand this is a bioweapons attack on the U.S.
[02:12:07.479 --> 02:12:14.965]  troops that's being waged by the treasonous high-level traitors of the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense.
[02:12:14.965 --> 02:12:29.557]  Now, to understand how this is happening, how did the CCP infiltrate the Pentagon, and I know you'll appreciate this fact, Alex, remember the OPM hack, the Office of Personnel Management hack by the CCP, I think that was in 2015 or 2016?
[02:12:30.998 --> 02:12:33.900]  Obama gave them all the codes, the 22 million U.S.
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:35.241]  intelligence military.
[02:12:35.241 --> 02:12:37.603]  They used that to then blackmail and control people.
[02:12:37.603 --> 02:12:38.284]  You got it.
[02:12:38.284 --> 02:12:40.586]  Now, remember what was in those files.
[02:12:40.586 --> 02:12:47.511]  They had these psychological profiles of high-level military leaders, including high-level FBI personnel.
[02:12:47.511 --> 02:12:55.958]  In their interviews, when they're being interviewed for top-level clearances and so on, they're asked a lot of psychological questions like, do you have multiple sex partners?
[02:12:55.958 --> 02:12:57.159]  Have you ever been abused?
[02:12:57.159 --> 02:12:57.700]  Things like that.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:17.484]  All of those psych records are now in the hands of the CCP and I believe that they're using those records to blackmail high-level officials in the FBI and the Pentagon to go along with the People's Liberation Army war against the United States military to then weaken
[02:13:18.024 --> 02:13:27.035]  Our military by having our own Pentagon mass murder our troops with spike protein bioweapons in the name of vaccines.
[02:13:27.035 --> 02:13:29.918]  And let's be clear, this is globalism taking over America.
[02:13:29.918 --> 02:13:31.260]  We're not supposed to exist.
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:35.404]  Quietly merging with the globalists under China and agreeing to spike our troops.
[02:13:35.905 --> 02:13:40.788]  To purge them and poison them as an armistice, as a sign of submission.
[02:13:40.788 --> 02:13:45.491]  China's not taking any of the, quote, U.S.-developed vaccines, which you now know are deadly poison.
[02:13:45.491 --> 02:13:46.691]  This is so obvious.
[02:13:46.691 --> 02:13:47.252]  Wow.
[02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:53.876]  So this is capitulation, like the Vichy French to Hitler, but Hitler didn't ask them to poison their military.
[02:13:53.876 --> 02:13:56.417]  So this is really unbelievable.
[02:13:56.417 --> 02:13:57.618]  And that's what's happening.
[02:13:58.556 --> 02:13:59.517]  That's exactly right.
[02:13:59.517 --> 02:14:03.258]  And remember, we've confirmed with other experts and guests before, such as J.R.
[02:14:03.258 --> 02:14:12.402]  Nyquist, that he's an expert on the Communist Chinese war stance, that Communist China has long planned for bioweapons attacks against the United States.
[02:14:12.402 --> 02:14:15.924]  It's just that they found a way for the United States to attack itself.
[02:14:16.084 --> 02:14:18.546]  They've done it with collaborators, so they don't get to blame.
[02:14:18.546 --> 02:14:24.310]  But they choreographed with the Rockefellers, and with Fauci, the fear, the hysteria, the collapse, the rollout, all of it.
[02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:26.091]  But remember, they won't take the shot.
[02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:26.772]  That's the key.
[02:14:26.772 --> 02:14:28.913]  China won't take the shot.
[02:14:28.913 --> 02:14:30.474]  Their citizens won't take the shot.
[02:14:30.474 --> 02:14:33.737]  Their government won't give the shot that they want us to take.
[02:14:34.699 --> 02:15:03.113]  And in fact, there's even more to this, a lot of details to share here, but there are people, and I'm not sure about this, but for those who believe that Trump might one day be reinstated by a Supreme Court decision, if that were to happen theoretically, Trump would inherit a weakened military with probably hundreds of thousands of dead and injured troops, so that the United States would be more vulnerable on a national security level,
[02:15:03.573 --> 02:15:04.913]  Which would mean the U.S.
[02:15:04.913 --> 02:15:10.115]  couldn't defend itself against foreign invasion or acts of war that are kinetic.
[02:15:10.115 --> 02:15:10.835]  You're totally right.
[02:15:10.835 --> 02:15:12.396]  This is the take out of the U.S.
[02:15:12.396 --> 02:15:13.976]  We come back, you'll have the floor.
[02:15:13.976 --> 02:15:14.697]  We'll cover it all.
[02:15:14.697 --> 02:15:15.877]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[02:15:15.877 --> 02:15:17.097]  That's why I have him on.
[02:15:17.097 --> 02:15:18.058]  He's so dead on.
[02:15:18.058 --> 02:15:19.478]  In fact, I intended to come on today.
[02:15:19.478 --> 02:15:22.719]  What we did with nuclear bombs going off and the rest of it.
[02:15:22.719 --> 02:15:23.820]  Hydrogen bombs going off.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.420]  Atomic bombs.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:26.841]  And I said, this is a globalist takeover.
[02:15:26.841 --> 02:15:28.501]  An agreement to get rid of our troops.
[02:15:28.501 --> 02:15:29.602]  An agreement to get rid of us.
[02:15:29.602 --> 02:15:30.322]  A litmus test.
[02:15:31.282 --> 02:15:33.403]  And those that are good globalists, they get the saline.
[02:15:33.403 --> 02:15:36.144]  Those that aren't get the deadly prion disease.
[02:15:36.144 --> 02:15:37.244]  And it's all confirmed.
[02:15:37.244 --> 02:15:40.905]  There's one trillion billion zillion percent.
[02:15:40.905 --> 02:15:42.226]  There's no debating.
[02:15:42.226 --> 02:15:43.386]  This is all confirmed.
[02:15:43.386 --> 02:15:44.787]  I wish it wasn't true.
[02:15:44.787 --> 02:15:46.307]  We are living in the twilight zone.
[02:15:46.307 --> 02:15:48.608]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:15:48.608 --> 02:15:50.209]  And we've got to take our government back.
[02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.689]  My God.
[02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:53.970]  Now they're about to literally poison all of our troops.
[02:15:53.970 --> 02:15:55.030]  And then our children.
[02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.870]  They're never going to stop.
[02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:57.311]  And China won't take the shot.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:04.042]  Your voice counts.
[02:16:04.042 --> 02:16:09.106]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:16:09.106 --> 02:16:11.688]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:16:11.688 --> 02:16:13.189]  They know you're angry.
[02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:18.013]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:16:18.573 --> 02:16:29.321]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:07.946]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:17:07.946 --> 02:17:08.987]  Here's why.
[02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:12.890]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:17:12.890 --> 02:17:18.014]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:17:18.014 --> 02:17:26.440]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:34.999]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:17:35.695 --> 02:17:41.779]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!

[02:17:56.029 --> 02:17:58.391]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.740]  Gerald in South Carolina.
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.241]  Go ahead, you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[02:18:03.241 --> 02:18:04.061]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:04.061 --> 02:18:04.501]  Welcome.
[02:18:04.501 --> 02:18:09.662]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:18:09.662 --> 02:18:13.043]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[02:18:13.043 --> 02:18:19.504]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:18:19.504 --> 02:18:21.165]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:18:21.165 --> 02:18:25.326]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:18:25.326 --> 02:18:26.746]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:18:27.046 --> 02:18:32.569]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:18:32.569 --> 02:18:33.369]  This is Matthew 24, verse 9.
[02:18:33.369 --> 02:18:35.410]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[02:18:51.437 --> 02:18:57.181]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[02:18:57.181 --> 02:19:03.744]  Because God created this country.
[02:19:03.744 --> 02:19:04.985]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:19:04.985 --> 02:19:05.826]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:19:05.826 --> 02:19:07.147]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:19:07.147 --> 02:19:07.707]  Good, Bob.
[02:19:07.707 --> 02:19:08.788]  Great last caller.
[02:19:08.788 --> 02:19:11.829]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:19:11.829 --> 02:19:17.553]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:19:17.553 --> 02:19:19.334]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[02:19:19.674 --> 02:19:21.315]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:19:21.315 --> 02:19:22.255]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:19:22.255 --> 02:19:22.635]  Go ahead.
[02:19:22.635 --> 02:19:23.056]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:23.056 --> 02:19:24.176]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:19:24.176 --> 02:19:27.197]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:19:27.197 --> 02:19:28.878]  The X2 does wonders.
[02:19:28.878 --> 02:19:30.019]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:19:30.019 --> 02:19:31.199]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:19:31.199 --> 02:19:31.999]  Get off the fence.
[02:19:31.999 --> 02:19:32.660]  Get the product.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.960]  Support the info war.
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.361]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:19:35.361 --> 02:19:36.021]  You're on the air.
[02:19:36.021 --> 02:19:36.581]  Thanks for holding.
[02:19:36.581 --> 02:19:36.962]  Go ahead.
[02:19:36.962 --> 02:19:37.582]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:37.582 --> 02:19:38.722]  It's great to be on with you.
[02:19:38.722 --> 02:19:39.403]  It's an honor.
[02:19:39.403 --> 02:19:39.683]  Honor.
[02:19:39.683 --> 02:19:40.003]  Talk to you.
[02:19:40.203 --> 02:19:41.364]  Awesome.
[02:19:41.364 --> 02:19:47.066]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product Alpha Power even at 29.
[02:19:47.066 --> 02:19:50.888]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[02:19:50.888 --> 02:19:53.549]  So, just number one for... Well, it definitely works.
[02:19:53.549 --> 02:19:55.189]  It's not a joke.
[02:19:55.189 --> 02:20:03.173]  Absolutely.
[02:20:03.173 --> 02:20:05.814]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.251 --> 02:20:31.975]  Well, I'm going to step aside so Mike Adams can interview this amazing guest, Dr. Richard M. Fleming.
[02:20:31.975 --> 02:20:37.058]  Coming up on the bioweapon straight ahead, but continuing, that's the point I've made, Mike.
[02:20:37.058 --> 02:20:40.120]  The Chinese, the Indians, others won't take this shot.
[02:20:41.155 --> 02:20:42.496]  But we're all told we're supposed to.
[02:20:42.496 --> 02:20:45.457]  The Australians only 27% have took it.
[02:20:45.457 --> 02:20:48.559]  The Saudi Arabians only 27% or less.
[02:20:48.559 --> 02:20:50.820]  But we're told we've really got to take this.
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:53.321]  Even though it doesn't protect us, none of it makes sense.
[02:20:53.321 --> 02:20:56.603]  They're being given orders.
[02:20:56.603 --> 02:21:00.545]  I saw you interviewed that other very well-spoken medical doctor.
[02:21:01.496 --> 02:21:04.478]  There's really been a charge, Dr. Lee Merritt, on the fact that this is an attack.
[02:21:04.478 --> 02:21:07.621]  She was saying, we don't know what group this is.
[02:21:07.621 --> 02:21:09.182]  We think it's an international organization.
[02:21:09.182 --> 02:21:10.203]  We know it's the globalists.
[02:21:10.203 --> 02:21:10.903]  It's the UN.
[02:21:10.903 --> 02:21:12.525]  It's the Rockefellers.
[02:21:12.525 --> 02:21:13.345]  It's the eugenicists.
[02:21:13.345 --> 02:21:15.247]  It's the depopulationists.
[02:21:15.247 --> 02:21:18.109]  They're the ones doing this and they want America out of the way.
[02:21:18.109 --> 02:21:21.572]  So how do you see this attack on our troops taking place and how do we stop it?
[02:21:22.677 --> 02:21:30.662]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you for what you're doing and supporting all these individual voices that, you know, we're all just out here interviewing all the experts that we can find.
[02:21:30.662 --> 02:21:34.645]  It's people like Del Bigtree and yourself and myself and others.
[02:21:34.645 --> 02:21:41.890]  And the experts, there are many courageous experts willing to step forward, like Dr. Merritt, and tell the truth, like Dr. Fleming,
[02:21:42.310 --> 02:21:47.954]  Who's coming on here in just a few minutes and the information he has is absolutely mind-blowing and it's irrefutable.
[02:21:47.954 --> 02:21:48.855]  This is what I want to say.
[02:21:48.855 --> 02:22:09.769]  There is absolutely no question whatsoever that this was developed as a biological weapon first in the United States military under the US Army Research Facility at Fort Detrick and then it was funneled into the Wuhan Institute of Virology with NIH money under Fauci in order to augment and enhance the gain-of-function properties.
[02:22:10.209 --> 02:22:23.062]  So, Alex, the shocking truth here is that this is a joint bioweapon developed by the United States and the Communist Chinese military, the PLA, and in that process... Well, that's not denied.
[02:22:23.062 --> 02:22:27.326]  Sent by Obama so he could bring it back against our own troops in the name of a vaccine.
[02:22:27.326 --> 02:22:29.128]  They put the bioweapon in the vaccine.
[02:22:30.202 --> 02:22:37.827]  That's exactly what it is, and understand that there was intellectual property transfer that took place to the Communist Chinese as part of this.
[02:22:37.827 --> 02:22:54.337]  So the original SARS viral template, you could say, was developed painstakingly over many years in the United States, and then that, and by the way, it was developed as a dual-use technology, so it could be used as a biological weapon or a vaccine, and then Fauci used that excuse
[02:22:54.717 --> 02:23:06.601]  As a cover story to say, oh no, we're only working on vaccines, we're working on defensive uses for this, when they were really building offensive biological weapons and handing the technology to the Communist Chinese military.
[02:23:06.601 --> 02:23:15.604]  And we see Fauci, exactly, handed to the Communist military, sorry to interrupt, we see Fauci and Gates being China-philes, saying China did great, America did bad, America's never going to reopen.
[02:23:15.604 --> 02:23:21.366]  They're openly collaborators in our own government and our own infrastructure are running an attack with China against us.
[02:23:22.537 --> 02:23:23.719]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:23:23.719 --> 02:23:35.434]  I mean, China must be laughing themselves silly celebrating how they've convinced America to commit vaccine suicide and inject all their own citizens with clot shots, death weapons.
[02:23:35.434 --> 02:23:36.756]  That's really what this is.
[02:23:36.756 --> 02:23:37.337]  It's almost like
[02:23:37.777 --> 02:23:46.266]  A bizarre, you know, Star Trek episode where people had to volunteer to show up for the extermination chambers because they were killed in a simulated war.
[02:23:46.266 --> 02:23:48.709]  Remember that episode back in the original Star Trek?
[02:23:48.709 --> 02:23:49.810]  That's almost what this is.
[02:23:49.810 --> 02:23:52.232]  People are showing up, almost like Soylent Green.
[02:23:52.232 --> 02:23:59.240]  They're showing up at extermination centers that are called, you know, immunization sites and people are being murdered.
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:08.187]  And they're murdering the military, they're murdering the doctors and the nurses, and even big tech is murdering their own employees with these vaccine mandates.
[02:24:08.187 --> 02:24:26.842]  And Alex, when the vitamin D levels fall towards the winter of this year and the traditional flu season kicks in towards the end of this year and the beginning of 2022, I believe we're going to see devastating hospitalization, sickness and death on a level we've never seen.
[02:24:27.022 --> 02:24:28.143]  I don't think that's a prediction.
[02:24:28.143 --> 02:24:29.245]  It's already here.
[02:24:29.245 --> 02:24:31.087]  They lied last year about full hospitals.
[02:24:31.087 --> 02:24:31.648]  It wasn't true.
[02:24:31.648 --> 02:24:33.510]  Now they are full.
[02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:36.814]  And doctors that told us last year they weren't full are saying they're full now.
[02:24:36.814 --> 02:24:38.456]  From the shedding, they've really hit us.
[02:24:38.456 --> 02:24:39.458]  I mean, we have to admit it.
[02:24:39.458 --> 02:24:40.659]  We've been hit by a bioweapon.
[02:24:40.659 --> 02:24:41.260]  They actually did it.
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:43.303]  And if we're not strong enough to admit it, they're going to win.
[02:24:44.777 --> 02:24:49.839]  And, you know, I'm interviewing Dr. Fleming here coming up in a few minutes, but also I just want to give your audience a heads up.
[02:24:49.839 --> 02:24:58.601]  Throughout the fourth hour, I'm going to focus on what you just said, Alex, which is that this is an attack on the human infrastructure that allows society to function.
[02:24:58.601 --> 02:25:00.322]  And there is a critical tipping point.
[02:25:00.862 --> 02:25:21.049]  Beyond which, if you have a certain percentage of casualties, then society, the complex society that we now live in, ceases to function because you've lost the redundancy and the know-how of the people who can run the power grid, or who can run the telecom infrastructure, or who can run the manufacturing machines, or the transportation systems.
[02:25:21.049 --> 02:25:25.630]  There is a critical point, and I don't know exactly where that is, but if we start to lose 25-30% of those who are vaccinated,
[02:25:27.651 --> 02:25:36.073]  There may be a tipping point beyond which this entire system suffers a cascading systemic collapse from which we are not able to recover.
[02:25:36.073 --> 02:25:40.075]  We're going to go back in that scenario to, you know, 18th century technology.
[02:25:40.075 --> 02:25:46.216]  Which, by the way, that's the treaty of 1992-21 for the post-industrial world.
[02:25:46.216 --> 02:25:47.497]  They have a plan with armored
[02:25:48.437 --> 02:25:48.837]  I don't
[02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:10.671]  Survival of the fittest.
[02:26:10.671 --> 02:26:12.072]  This is social Darwinism.
[02:26:12.072 --> 02:26:15.514]  So they are applying this to us, saying we don't deserve to live.
[02:26:15.514 --> 02:26:17.175]  Well how about they don't deserve to live?
[02:26:17.175 --> 02:26:23.600]  So whether you believe that there's too many people or not, this is their now operational program to do this, Mike.
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:27.723]  We have lived to see it and be on air when they launch their attack.
[02:26:28.664 --> 02:26:29.105]  Exactly.
[02:26:29.105 --> 02:26:33.028]  I call it their bioweapons nuke-from-orbit stance.
[02:26:33.028 --> 02:26:39.133]  Now, I don't mean literal orbit, but they are fleeing the areas that they're nuking with the bioweapons.
[02:26:39.133 --> 02:26:45.217]  They're going to the private islands, and there are underground bunkers, and there are special secret places all over the world.
[02:26:45.217 --> 02:26:50.482]  Caves, for example, that are filled with supplies to live ten years, but then they're nuking
[02:26:51.002 --> 02:27:00.265]  Everybody who's left on the surface of the planet, who's mostly oblivious in society, thinking that everything's going to return to normal if they just comply with the vaccine mandates.
[02:27:00.265 --> 02:27:06.568]  And then Fauci comes out today and says, uh, yeah, probably everybody's going to need a third, you know, shot soon.
[02:27:06.568 --> 02:27:11.209]  And then that's going to be a fourth shot and a fifth shot, basically until you're dead.
[02:27:11.209 --> 02:27:13.870]  They're just going to keep injecting you until you're dead.
[02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:15.871]  And that's what compliance will get you.
[02:27:15.871 --> 02:27:17.952]  By the way, you obey, you die.
[02:27:17.952 --> 02:27:18.512]  That's where we are.
[02:27:18.752 --> 02:27:29.221]  So it's a gauntlet they run us through, but if the fine print doesn't work, doesn't help you, poisons us, and they're just doing it, they're never going to survive in their bunkers, they're never going to get away with what they've done, Mike.
[02:27:29.221 --> 02:27:42.714]  Because here's the good news, they could have been successful if you and I and countless others hadn't exposed it for decades, but the fact that they went ahead and launched this operation when it's part of American and world culture knowing this was coming, I think they made a big mistake.
[02:27:43.581 --> 02:27:44.462]  I think so, too.
[02:27:44.462 --> 02:27:46.943]  I think they've vastly underestimated the pushback.
[02:27:46.943 --> 02:27:49.725]  They've underestimated how many people are well-informed.
[02:27:49.725 --> 02:27:53.187]  PhDs are the top groups saying no to vaccines.
[02:27:53.187 --> 02:27:57.650]  Look at the super-intelligent people, including the guests we're about to interview, Dr. Fleming.
[02:27:57.650 --> 02:28:02.994]  High IQ individual, has the facts and the information, knows to warn people.
[02:28:02.994 --> 02:28:05.996]  By the way, you know this, big studies came out, two new ones.
[02:28:05.996 --> 02:28:09.919]  The highest educated, most informed, highest income are the people not taking the shots.
[02:28:10.339 --> 02:28:11.279]  That's right.
[02:28:11.279 --> 02:28:12.580]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:20.163]  And so people are going to pay the ultimate price for bad decision making, believing false authority, and trying to obey.
[02:28:20.163 --> 02:28:21.744]  They're going to end up dying.
[02:28:21.744 --> 02:28:24.866]  I'm very fearful about the deaths that are coming.
[02:28:24.866 --> 02:28:26.726]  This is a big interview.
[02:28:26.726 --> 02:28:29.248]  Everything we do is important, but I'm not just hyping this.
[02:28:29.248 --> 02:28:31.829]  Everybody out there, this is a top doctor.
[02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:35.390]  About to lay out the bio weapon for everybody, so do your part.
[02:28:35.390 --> 02:28:41.133]  Go to FreeWorldNews.tv, go to Band.Video, go to InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:28:41.133 --> 02:28:49.236]  Take the live feed of this show and send it on your email, your text message, your word of mouth, tell your co-workers, or later on this is archived at Band.Video, and share it!
[02:28:49.236 --> 02:28:51.397]  But whatever you do, fight back!
[02:28:51.397 --> 02:28:52.818]  Resistance is victory!
[02:28:52.818 --> 02:28:55.539]  Alright, Mike Adams and his special guest, coming up.
[02:28:59.127 --> 02:29:07.549]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:07.549 --> 02:29:08.569]  Here's why.
[02:29:08.569 --> 02:29:12.490]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:12.490 --> 02:29:17.612]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:17.612 --> 02:29:26.014]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:26.594 --> 02:29:34.587]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:35.302 --> 02:29:41.385]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:29:41.385 --> 02:29:45.207]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:45.207 --> 02:29:47.228]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:29:47.228 --> 02:29:55.632]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:29:55.632 --> 02:29:57.993]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:30:01.104 --> 02:30:12.871]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[02:30:12.871 --> 02:30:16.734]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked pretty
[02:30:16.834 --> 02:30:17.394]  Pretty good.
[02:30:17.394 --> 02:30:23.437]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with F2, you have, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[02:30:23.437 --> 02:30:30.120]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:31.201]  I could think again.
[02:30:31.201 --> 02:30:32.902]  I could connect with people again.
[02:30:33.422 --> 02:30:39.385]  After the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:30:39.385 --> 02:30:41.766]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:43.667]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:30:43.667 --> 02:30:45.888]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:30:45.888 --> 02:30:46.629]  It's amazing.
[02:30:46.629 --> 02:30:47.149]  It works.
[02:30:47.149 --> 02:30:49.750]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:55.893]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:30:55.893 --> 02:30:57.154]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:30:57.154 --> 02:30:59.075]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:31:00.934 --> 02:31:09.104]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:31:09.104 --> 02:31:17.894]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[02:31:17.894 --> 02:31:19.837]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up.
[02:31:20.217 --> 02:31:24.779]  In a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:24.779 --> 02:31:27.440]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[02:31:44.690 --> 02:31:50.115]  Friends and family of these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[02:31:50.115 --> 02:31:52.757]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[02:31:52.757 --> 02:31:58.002]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[02:31:58.002 --> 02:32:00.525]  They're 50% off right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:32:02.142 --> 02:32:04.083]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[02:32:04.083 --> 02:32:07.025]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[02:32:07.025 --> 02:32:07.605]  I know you do.
[02:32:07.605 --> 02:32:08.906]  That's why you're here.
[02:32:08.906 --> 02:32:19.273]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth, that have great products that are self-funded.

[02:32:59.309 --> 02:33:02.712]  So thank you so much for your support.
[02:33:02.712 --> 02:33:05.334]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.704 --> 02:33:23.632]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:33:23.632 --> 02:33:27.956]  You better believe you got one!
[02:33:27.956 --> 02:33:33.082]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:51.403 --> 02:33:52.104]  All right, welcome.
[02:33:52.104 --> 02:33:57.987]  This is Mike Adams here, taking over for the rest of this third hour and into the entire fourth hour as well.
[02:33:57.987 --> 02:34:13.456]  We're going to be joined in just a minute by Dr. Richard M. Fleming, who has, I think, a very important message for humanity and has done extensive research in this area and understands the origins of this biological weapon and its implications for humanity.
[02:34:13.976 --> 02:34:18.941]  Now, he's the author of a book called, Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?
[02:34:18.941 --> 02:34:24.047]  That book is available on Amazon and Barnes & Noble and all the usual places.
[02:34:24.047 --> 02:34:28.291]  Dr. Fleming also has a website called FlemingMethod.com.
[02:34:28.291 --> 02:34:36.340]  He's trained as a physicist, he's a PhD and MD, he's a nuclear cardiologist, and he's also an expert in inflammation
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:38.861]  And inflammation response.
[02:34:38.861 --> 02:34:46.245]  So I think his information is probably right up there among the most important information for humanity right now.
[02:34:46.245 --> 02:34:47.185]  No kidding.
[02:34:47.185 --> 02:34:48.366]  No exaggeration.
[02:34:48.366 --> 02:34:50.907]  The world needs to listen to this man.
[02:34:50.907 --> 02:34:55.190]  And Dr. Fleming, if you are with us right now, welcome to the show.
[02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:56.070]  It's great to have you on.
[02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:58.611]  It's good to be here, Mike.
[02:34:58.611 --> 02:34:59.692]  Thank you for the invitation.
[02:35:00.779 --> 02:35:01.600]  Well, absolutely.
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:02.640]  Thank you for joining me.
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:04.982]  Now, here's what's interesting.
[02:35:04.982 --> 02:35:29.742]  Alex invited me to host this segment, this part of the show today, and when he did that, I immediately thought of you, and having you as a very important guest, because you and I did an interview on my network earlier this week, and that interview is just blowing people's minds, and I'd like, I mean, just, it's just, my phone's blowing up from people watching that interview, so I'd like, really, if possible,
[02:35:30.342 --> 02:35:48.041]  Could you revisit now, let's start back at the beginning, what is the story of how this spike protein and SARS-CoV-2 came into existence and how it got augmented and how it became this biological weapon that's now assaulting humanity?
[02:35:48.041 --> 02:35:49.143]  Start from the beginning if you would please.
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:59.305]  To begin with, there's a term called gain-of-function, and you used the other one a few moments ago, dual-function, which is the same thing.
[02:35:59.305 --> 02:36:03.489]  It's just a different name that doesn't sound like it's as problematic.
[02:36:03.489 --> 02:36:10.554]  But gain-of-function is research that tries to take an infectious disease like a virus and make it a little bit more infective.
[02:36:10.554 --> 02:36:19.521]  So if you stayed ahead of it just, you know, a year or two, you'd have some good opportunities to treat people and keep things from getting out of whack.
[02:36:19.521 --> 02:36:20.602]  The problem is, is that
[02:36:21.539 --> 02:36:36.865]  Those same people can continue to do a lot of research, and we know since back in 1999 and about 10 years before that, there was a lot of research going on by a number of people that were very interested to see just how far they could push the envelope.
[02:36:36.865 --> 02:36:40.866]  And they got millions, tens of millions of dollars from the U.S.
[02:36:40.866 --> 02:36:49.390]  government, from our federal agencies, including NIAID, NIH, Department of Defense, USAID, a number of agencies.
[02:36:50.589 --> 02:37:09.174]  Even during times when gain-of-function research had been shut down because scientists like myself were concerned about what was happening or worried about the potential real infections that could go on with these more infective viruses that were being worked on.
[02:37:09.174 --> 02:37:18.917]  The book, Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?, really takes and looks at this spike protein and what's been done to it over those decades.
[02:37:18.917 --> 02:37:19.277]  It looks at
[02:37:19.878 --> 02:37:36.042]  The grants that were paid to these researchers coming out of the federal government and by researchers specifically at EcoHealth, who then gave monies to Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina and Xi Zengli at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:37:36.042 --> 02:37:44.285]  And these aren't the only universities, unfortunately, doing this or research facilities, but they are certainly up there in the top.
[02:37:45.951 --> 02:37:49.760]  Group, Fort Detrick, of course, has its hands on this as well.
[02:37:52.014 --> 02:38:12.093]  One of the ways in which I can tell you that Fort Detrick deals with these viruses and imaging of these viruses is that I actually had some people try to recruit me for a job at Fort Detrick to do viral research and physics imaging of those viruses paid for by NIAID.
[02:38:12.093 --> 02:38:14.755]  So, it's kind of hard for them to say, you know, we're not connected.
[02:38:16.727 --> 02:38:22.469]  There's lots of research papers that show exactly how they've tweaked these viruses over the years.
[02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:24.450]  There are patents that have been issued.
[02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:30.413]  A lot of people think that these patents maybe are for a different life form, and that's really not what they are.
[02:38:30.413 --> 02:38:34.795]  The patents are patents for how to modify viruses.
[02:38:34.795 --> 02:38:41.257]  So they're actually getting the intellectual property for the process, which tells you they have a lot invested.
[02:38:41.257 --> 02:38:42.078]  And the U.S.
[02:38:42.078 --> 02:38:45.079]  government gets patent monies off that research.
[02:38:46.055 --> 02:38:52.179]  So for the U.S., you know, for Fauci to say they don't do gain-of-function research is very disingenuous.
[02:38:52.179 --> 02:38:55.221]  Absolutely.
[02:38:55.221 --> 02:39:05.428]  I mean, sorry to interrupt, but I've even learned recently that Fauci himself, at least as is reported, is one of the owners or co-owners of some of the patents on
[02:39:07.695 --> 02:39:14.678]  HIV regions that appear to be part of the spike protein shell right now.
[02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:17.339]  Is that something that you've covered in your book?
[02:39:17.339 --> 02:39:19.900]  Does that sound accurate?
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:35.085]  We have some of the components of HIV in there, particularly dating back to 2004 when Xi Zengli put in the glycoprotein 120 component of HIV, and it attaches to a very specific receptor in cells, and that glycoprotein 120 causes prion diseases.
[02:39:36.706 --> 02:39:38.287]  Xi Zengli knew that at the time.
[02:39:38.287 --> 02:39:39.909]  The papers were published at the time.
[02:39:39.909 --> 02:39:43.872]  That's one of the important things, I think, to take into consideration.
[02:39:43.872 --> 02:39:50.858]  It's one thing to kind of get the data, but it's more important to say, okay, what did they know at that time?
[02:39:50.858 --> 02:39:59.586]  And once you realize that the published research had already been there, that Xi Zengli and Ralph Barrett and Daszak and Fauci knew about this,
[02:40:01.365 --> 02:40:08.850]  It's much more nefarious because you realize that they had good working knowledge about these changes that they were doing.
[02:40:08.850 --> 02:40:18.655]  And so these viruses, you know, there's very clear evidence that SARS-CoV-1 from 2002 was actually their first bioweapon.
[02:40:18.655 --> 02:40:20.056]  And this is an updated version.
[02:40:20.831 --> 02:40:25.174]  A bioweapon isn't something that you want to kill people.
[02:40:25.174 --> 02:40:27.335]  A good weapon doesn't kill the enemy.
[02:40:27.335 --> 02:40:31.157]  It slowly but surely demoralizes them and harms them.
[02:40:31.157 --> 02:40:39.863]  In this case, damages their society and their economy and causes slow, malicious diseases.
[02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:42.084]  We know that this virus is very good.
[02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:45.708]  At producing inflammation and blood clotting.
[02:40:45.708 --> 02:40:57.876]  And that was actually the theory that I first presented at American Heart in 1994 to explain heart disease and cancers and high blood pressure and diabetes was this inflammatory and thrombotic process.
[02:40:57.876 --> 02:41:05.121]  And these viruses are very good at that, particularly up front when you had other diseases for these people.
[02:41:05.121 --> 02:41:10.224]  So last year when we saw people with comorbidities, you know, these are the diseases dying,
[02:41:11.534 --> 02:41:12.855]  They didn't have to die.
[02:41:12.855 --> 02:41:16.919]  They died because they didn't get treatments for this inflammation and blood clotting.
[02:41:16.919 --> 02:41:21.483]  And they didn't get treatments because everybody was told there were no treatments.
[02:41:21.483 --> 02:41:28.830]  And so doctors were afraid to use treatments, or doctors licenses were called into play, or doctors were arrested, you know.
[02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:31.513]  Just to interject.
[02:41:33.717 --> 02:41:55.897]  Real quickly, so you're an expert on inflammation, and as you're describing it, the inflammatory effects of the spike protein are not only limited to vascular damage, which could be blood clots, it could be heart attacks, or perhaps strokes and so on, but I believe from what you're saying, the inflammatory effects can also be neurological or autoimmune in nature.
[02:41:55.897 --> 02:41:57.399]  Would that be a correct assessment?
[02:41:58.134 --> 02:41:59.555]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:41:59.555 --> 02:42:05.360]  There's some good studies that we have on the website PlumbingMethod.com that actually shows animal research.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:06.902]  So, humanized mice
[02:42:07.543 --> 02:42:21.892]  And Rhesus macaque models are the two best ones that we have information on showing that these spike proteins, and it doesn't matter whether they come in from the virus or whether they're made by a vaccine, which is the genetic sequence of the bioweapon.
[02:42:21.892 --> 02:42:27.695]  So they just simply put that inside of a drug vaccine biologic and then injected that into people.
[02:42:27.695 --> 02:42:32.398]  And it's just astonishing that they don't have any remorse for doing this.
[02:42:33.298 --> 02:42:34.880]  Dr. Fleming, I'm sorry to cut you off.
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:37.182]  We're about to go to a quick break here.
[02:42:37.182 --> 02:42:44.108]  I'll ask you to continue that thought on the other side of that break, and I also want to ask you about what may be next.
[02:42:44.108 --> 02:42:48.072]  If they've developed multiple bioweapons, what's next in store for us?
[02:42:48.072 --> 02:42:52.636]  Because there is an immune suppression component that we talked about previously.
[02:42:52.636 --> 02:42:53.857]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[02:42:53.857 --> 02:42:55.899]  You're watching InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:56.500]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:59.485 --> 02:43:04.729]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Super Sale.
[02:43:04.729 --> 02:43:10.552]  And we have the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium, 50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[02:43:10.552 --> 02:43:14.595]  Vitamin C, Zinc, and Rosehips, very strong formula.
[02:43:14.595 --> 02:43:17.297]  This is 50% off at Infolwerestore.com.
[02:43:17.617 --> 02:43:20.160]  Now back in stock, just came back in yesterday.
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:23.483]  Very powerful, pure turmeric extract tincture.
[02:43:23.483 --> 02:43:27.367]  Not a sure immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[02:43:27.367 --> 02:43:30.850]  And then, sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:43:30.850 --> 02:43:34.473]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint.
[02:43:34.473 --> 02:43:38.938]  And so much more, back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash.
[02:43:39.158 --> 02:43:39.799]  We're good to go.
[02:43:59.841 --> 02:44:03.145]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[02:44:03.145 --> 02:44:06.609]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[02:44:06.609 --> 02:44:09.352]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[02:44:09.352 --> 02:44:10.253]  And that's my allegory.
[02:44:11.314 --> 02:44:22.380]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:24.701]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[02:44:24.701 --> 02:44:30.424]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[02:44:30.424 --> 02:44:36.648]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[02:44:36.648 --> 02:44:38.088]  It's a total solution.
[02:44:38.088 --> 02:44:39.249]  All around the best you're going to find.
[02:44:39.369 --> 02:44:40.369]  TurboForce.
[02:44:40.369 --> 02:44:42.610]  Without you, we don't roll.
[02:44:42.610 --> 02:44:44.351]  With you, we surge forward together.
[02:44:44.351 --> 02:44:46.372]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[02:44:46.372 --> 02:44:48.973]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[02:44:48.973 --> 02:44:52.034]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[02:44:52.034 --> 02:44:53.814]  It's a win-win.
[02:44:53.814 --> 02:44:54.495]  360 together.
[02:44:54.495 --> 02:44:55.955]  Info or store.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:45:00.649 --> 02:45:04.271]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[02:45:04.271 --> 02:45:08.814]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[02:45:08.814 --> 02:45:18.040]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:20.562]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid,
[02:45:20.922 --> 02:45:40.011]  They are now making that move, and they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:56.450]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[02:45:56.450 --> 02:46:00.332]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[02:46:00.332 --> 02:46:08.658]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[02:46:09.597 --> 02:46:14.781]  We have this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[02:46:14.781 --> 02:46:18.623]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[02:46:18.623 --> 02:46:21.905]  But when it comes to media, Infowars has been the tip of that spear.
[02:46:21.905 --> 02:46:29.591]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[02:46:30.151 --> 02:46:37.896]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[02:46:37.896 --> 02:46:41.158]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[02:46:41.158 --> 02:46:46.002]  And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalists.
[02:46:46.002 --> 02:46:50.324]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[02:46:50.324 --> 02:46:56.489]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[02:46:56.489 --> 02:46:59.110]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.911]  Take action now.
[02:47:03.741 --> 02:47:06.348]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:23.670 --> 02:47:26.772]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[02:47:26.772 --> 02:47:27.673]  I'm filling in.
[02:47:27.673 --> 02:47:34.677]  Mike Adams here, and my special guest today is Dr. Richard M. Fleming, the author of Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?
[02:47:34.677 --> 02:47:41.702]  We're discussing the origins of COVID-19 and the spike protein component of it that's being put into vaccines.
[02:47:42.202 --> 02:47:49.988]  Dr. Fleming has an urgent warning for humanity, and he fully understands how this was developed and deployed.
[02:47:49.988 --> 02:48:06.881]  My follow-up question to you, sorry to cut you off there before the break, Dr. Fleming, but my question is, it seems like from what you're saying, there can be no denial that these are bioweapons, they were developed intentionally as biological weapons, and then the dual-use story was just a cover story.
[02:48:06.881 --> 02:48:10.544]  I mean, how can Fauci just blatantly lie to the world about all of this?
[02:48:12.162 --> 02:48:13.785]  Well, I think that's the problem.
[02:48:13.785 --> 02:48:18.414]  I think the world and the United States are waking up and asking questions.
[02:48:18.414 --> 02:48:21.079]  You know, if you want to lock down and don't get people to think,
[02:48:21.844 --> 02:48:28.887]  You take the intellectuals out of the conversation, you separate people from communicating, and you try to manipulate the scenario.
[02:48:28.887 --> 02:48:31.889]  And that's exactly what Adolf Hitler did in World War II.
[02:48:31.889 --> 02:48:34.890]  The first people who went to concentration camps were the intellectuals.
[02:48:34.890 --> 02:48:39.012]  And then he went after the Jews and the homeless and anybody else he didn't like.
[02:48:39.012 --> 02:48:45.715]  So you take those people out, and you have no other source of communication except with the governments actually telling you.
[02:48:48.390 --> 02:48:53.232]  Barrick, you can find patents back to 2002.
[02:48:53.232 --> 02:49:02.178]  And one of the other viruses that Barrick really likes is something called transmissible gastroenteritis virus or TGV.
[02:49:02.178 --> 02:49:12.644]  And he has worked with this virus along with the coronaviruses to play with their genetic codes and insert part of one into part of another one in an effort to get around it.
[02:49:12.644 --> 02:49:13.805]  And if you go back to
[02:49:16.265 --> 02:49:40.807]  2016, in July of 2016, there is a paper that Shi Zheng Li and Peter Daszak and a few other people from EcoHealth put together where they took another piece of genetic material and added it to coronaviruses to allow coronaviruses to escape our immune system so we would not make a defense against the virus.
[02:49:41.431 --> 02:49:45.732]  Now, you know, this is published data, so it's not like I'm making anything up.
[02:49:45.732 --> 02:49:50.593]  You know, you can go find this in the book and on the website, and that's the incriminating stuff.
[02:49:50.593 --> 02:49:55.494]  You know, this book is really an indictment when you get right down to it, and that's my legal hat here.
[02:49:55.494 --> 02:50:01.395]  But, you know, this spike protein is well known to cross the blood-brain barrier.
[02:50:01.395 --> 02:50:08.017]  It causes the brain to look like a sponge or a spongiform encephalopathy, which is frequently called mad cow disease.
[02:50:08.556 --> 02:50:14.177]  It causes Alzheimer's disease with what's called Lewy body formation, these prions in the brain.
[02:50:14.177 --> 02:50:19.099]  It causes damage to the heart because it's inflammation and blood clotting is occurring all over the body.
[02:50:19.099 --> 02:50:26.421]  It's not going to be consistent that everybody's going to have the same bad outcome and it's going to slowly but surely take place over time.
[02:50:26.421 --> 02:50:35.503]  And I remember raising the question back in March that there was no way in the world that these vaccines, these drug-based projects that they were coming out with,
[02:50:35.939 --> 02:50:39.962]  Well, guess which animal model has been used for the self-amplifying mRNA for SARS-CoV-2?
[02:50:39.962 --> 02:50:42.004]  Most animal models are dog, cat, mouse, rat,
[02:51:06.024 --> 02:51:11.174]  Guess what animal model they were using for this research?
[02:51:11.174 --> 02:51:11.674]  You tell me.
[02:51:11.674 --> 02:51:11.975]  Human.
[02:51:11.975 --> 02:51:13.157]  No, no.
[02:51:13.157 --> 02:51:13.718]  Human.
[02:51:13.718 --> 02:51:15.702]  Well, what you've just said...
[02:51:17.671 --> 02:51:20.213]  Okay, so number one, this is bombshell stuff.
[02:51:20.213 --> 02:51:28.118]  Number one, they've documented their entire history of carrying out what I'm calling these crimes against humanity, so they can't take it back.
[02:51:28.118 --> 02:51:33.382]  It's in the patent record, it's in their videos, it's in their own words, it's in the science papers.
[02:51:33.382 --> 02:51:36.304]  But what you just said now has me even more concerned.
[02:51:36.804 --> 02:51:58.028]  Because you just said the self, essentially self-replicating vaccine technology or self-assembling mRNA, which means that, see, we were told by the establishment that the mRNA is injected into you at a certain mass, a certain number of micrograms of mRNA, and that it then churns out
[02:51:58.348 --> 02:52:02.852]  You know, a certain number of spike protein particles, and then it's done.
[02:52:02.852 --> 02:52:03.452]  And that's it.
[02:52:03.452 --> 02:52:05.114]  Like, it runs out.
[02:52:05.114 --> 02:52:19.126]  But from what you're saying, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that then these instructions can themselves self-replicate, which means this may be an ongoing transformation of people's bodies into spike protein factories.
[02:52:19.126 --> 02:52:20.007]  Am I hearing you correctly?
[02:52:21.886 --> 02:52:23.889]  Right, so for a variety of reasons, that's right.
[02:52:23.889 --> 02:52:33.900]  First off, there's now two published papers that show that the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, even if it's just for the spike protein, can get into your DNA.
[02:52:33.900 --> 02:52:38.326]  That's called reverse transcription, and that's something that we've known about in science since HIV.
[02:52:39.375 --> 02:52:44.357]  HIV, which Dr. Fauci was very much in the scene at the time.
[02:52:44.357 --> 02:52:56.023]  I was in medical school when it came out, so I've always kind of looked at that and said, well, I can't find any good papers that Dr. Fauci has really published on HIV since the early days when I was in medical college.
[02:52:57.682 --> 02:52:59.823]  So we know it gets back into your DNA.
[02:52:59.823 --> 02:53:04.165]  We know it gets into all but three of the human chromosomes.
[02:53:04.165 --> 02:53:06.626]  We know that it keeps replicating itself.
[02:53:06.626 --> 02:53:10.267]  We know that the injections don't stay at the site of injection.
[02:53:10.267 --> 02:53:12.288]  And we have known that since 2017.
[02:53:12.288 --> 02:53:15.370]  This is not brand new to the world.
[02:53:15.370 --> 02:53:21.012]  Moderna had a lipid nanoparticle influenza vaccine that they did studies on in the animals.
[02:53:21.676 --> 02:53:28.899]  And when they injected in the animals, that spread to the brain, the heart, the liver, the spleen, the bone marrow, all throughout the animal.
[02:53:28.899 --> 02:53:35.261]  So to pretend that they thought that this was going to stay right where it was, was just, it's, they're lying.
[02:53:36.521 --> 02:53:37.763]  Of course they're lying.
[02:53:37.763 --> 02:53:38.764]  You're absolutely right.
[02:53:38.764 --> 02:53:45.691]  Even the EU, I think, has just put new warnings on one of the COVID vaccines about kidney damage.
[02:53:45.691 --> 02:53:50.596]  Well, how is the spike protein getting to the kidneys if it stays in the injection site?
[02:53:50.596 --> 02:53:57.524]  How is it damaging the ovaries and causing, in some cases, spontaneous abortions or infertility if it's staying in the injection site?
[02:53:57.524 --> 02:53:58.465]  Clearly, as you're saying,
[02:53:58.965 --> 02:54:13.401]  This is circulating throughout the body, and if it crosses the blood-brain barrier, getting to what you just said in the last segment, and I'm going to translate this crudely into layman's terms, it sounds like, over time, the spike protein eats your brain.
[02:54:13.401 --> 02:54:14.362]  It eats your heart.
[02:54:14.362 --> 02:54:15.644]  It eats your vascular system.
[02:54:15.644 --> 02:54:17.967]  I know those aren't medical terms, but just crudely,
[02:54:18.467 --> 02:54:27.652]  That's what it sounds like is in store for these people, not only who have taken double shots now, but who are going to be talked into taking booster shots.
[02:54:27.652 --> 02:54:31.915]  A third booster, a fourth booster, never ending, I guess until you're dead.
[02:54:31.915 --> 02:54:36.357]  Maybe they'll try to inject you after you're dead because they can still bill Medicare for that.
[02:54:36.357 --> 02:54:36.858]  It's insane.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:49.226]  Well, and one thing people need to realize is that as far as vaccines are concerned, I want to hit this with the Delta variant because people are concerned and they should be.
[02:54:49.226 --> 02:54:51.267]  There's not one human being.
[02:54:51.267 --> 02:54:52.887]  There's not one type of bacteria.
[02:54:52.887 --> 02:54:54.448]  There's not one type of SARS-CoV-2.
[02:54:54.448 --> 02:54:56.549]  There's all sorts of variants.
[02:54:56.549 --> 02:54:58.350]  There's 17 different variants.
[02:54:58.350 --> 02:55:05.294]  And so what they did was to take the genetic sequence that they had put together that made their bioweapon.
[02:55:05.294 --> 02:55:06.114]  And then they put that
[02:55:06.764 --> 02:55:09.026]  into a drug vaccine and inject it into people.
[02:55:09.026 --> 02:55:17.813]  Now, normally a person will get hundreds or thousands or maybe tens of thousands of virus from if somebody coughs and spreads it to you.
[02:55:17.813 --> 02:55:19.794]  And you'll respond to that.
[02:55:19.794 --> 02:55:32.904]  And if you had these comorbidities, all these other diseases, then and you didn't get treated for the inflammation of blood clots, the critical thing, then people died, you know, over 600,000 people, you know, in the United States, millions worldwide.
[02:55:32.904 --> 02:55:33.785]  But even you take
[02:55:34.707 --> 02:55:43.858]  These vaccines, the Pfizer-Moderna mRNA lipid nanoparticles contain 13.1 billion of this.
[02:55:43.858 --> 02:55:51.447]  The Pfizer and, or I'm sorry, the AstraZeneca and Janssen or Johnson and Johnson have 50 billion.
[02:55:51.963 --> 02:56:09.147]  And let's cover Novavax while we're at it, because all they did with Novavax is they put that genetic sequence into moth, M-O-T-H cells, and then grew the spike proteins in moth cells, and then harvested that, put it together with nanoparticles and a soap irritant from a tree to inject that into people.
[02:56:09.147 --> 02:56:10.348]  So that's not any better.
[02:56:10.348 --> 02:56:18.550]  I mean, it just, you know, the only difference is that who knows what is attached to the spike protein after it was in the moth cell and got reproduced, right?
[02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:19.970]  Because it certainly wasn't human DNA.
[02:56:20.570 --> 02:56:27.032]  Where you can make the argument in humans that maybe it was human DNA, but now we have potentially moth DNA coming into it.
[02:56:27.032 --> 02:56:29.933]  Who knows?
[02:56:29.933 --> 02:56:36.195]  And so when you have healthy people, particularly our kids and our military, right?
[02:56:36.195 --> 02:56:40.517]  You know, healthy people, and you give them billions versus hundreds or thousands
[02:56:40.947 --> 02:56:45.228]  You're going to get a bigger inflammation and blood clotting or inflammatory thrombotic response.
[02:56:45.228 --> 02:56:56.472]  And that's why we're seeing healthy people have all these consequences because they're healthy people and they're responding to a massive attack and their immune system is trying to function.
[02:56:56.472 --> 02:56:59.113]  It just, you know, they've never seen things like that.
[02:56:59.113 --> 02:57:02.254]  Now let's get to the final thing with this virus and these vaccines.
[02:57:03.268 --> 02:57:05.990]  Well, again, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:07.131]  We're about to go to break again.
[02:57:07.131 --> 02:57:19.479]  I hope you can stay with us another segment or two because I want to ask you about inflammation and what can people do if they've perhaps taken these vaccines so far and they've realized what's going on.
[02:57:19.479 --> 02:57:22.862]  Maybe they've suffered adverse reactions and they're saying, oh, they're waking up.
[02:57:23.382 --> 02:57:30.186]  We've got to talk about systemic inflammation, ways to prevent it, which is what you are an expert in, among other things.
[02:57:30.186 --> 02:57:32.908]  You talk about a multidisciplinary expert.
[02:57:32.908 --> 02:57:34.729]  You're an amazing individual.
[02:57:34.729 --> 02:57:35.770]  You've got a lot of knowledge.
[02:57:35.770 --> 02:57:37.110]  So stay with us, please.
[02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:45.135]  And we'll be back, folks, with Dr. Richard M. Fleming, talking about inflammation and what we can do, even if you're exposed to spike protein.
[02:57:45.135 --> 02:57:47.156]  You need to deal with this, even if you haven't taken a shot.
[02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:47.777]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:49.411 --> 02:57:54.657]  For only one week, we're running Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[02:57:54.657 --> 02:57:57.820]  And we have the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium.
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:58:00.483]  50% off, so essential for your immune system.
[02:58:00.483 --> 02:58:03.106]  Vitamin C, Zinc, and Rosehips.
[02:58:03.106 --> 02:58:04.548]  Very strong formula.
[02:58:04.548 --> 02:58:07.571]  This is 50% off at Infolwerestore.com.
[02:58:07.571 --> 02:58:09.453]  Now back in stock, just came back in yesterday.
[02:58:10.114 --> 02:58:17.300]  Very powerful pure turmeric extract tincture, not a sure immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:20.763]  And then sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:58:20.763 --> 02:58:28.870]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with a natural peppermint and so much more back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash.
[02:58:29.090 --> 02:58:29.991]  We're good to go.
[02:58:50.492 --> 02:58:54.037]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[02:58:54.037 --> 02:58:55.539]  I was overweight.
[02:58:55.539 --> 02:58:57.802]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[02:58:57.802 --> 02:58:59.764]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[02:58:59.764 --> 02:59:02.268]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:59:02.268 --> 02:59:04.971]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[02:59:05.552 --> 02:59:06.053]  I think so.
[02:59:22.773 --> 02:59:28.777]  For the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:59:28.777 --> 02:59:31.159]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:59:31.159 --> 02:59:33.060]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:35.282]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[02:59:35.282 --> 02:59:36.022]  It's amazing.
[02:59:36.022 --> 02:59:36.543]  It works.
[02:59:36.543 --> 02:59:39.084]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:59:39.084 --> 02:59:45.289]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:59:45.289 --> 02:59:46.549]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:59:46.549 --> 02:59:48.471]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:59:53.186 --> 02:59:55.830]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.773 --> 03:00:14.136]  Alright, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:14.136 --> 03:00:19.179]  I'm Mike Adams, filling in today with my special guest, Dr. Richard M. Fleming.
[03:00:19.179 --> 03:00:21.020]  And Dr. Fleming, once again, thank you for your time.
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:25.342]  I know you're extremely busy, literally trying to save the world right now.
[03:00:25.342 --> 03:00:27.223]  It's not even a metaphor.
[03:00:27.223 --> 03:00:28.424]  We're trying to save the world.
[03:00:28.804 --> 03:00:38.508]  Now, this segment isn't broadcast on all the radio stations of the entire show, so we're going to save a couple questions for six minutes later or so.
[03:00:38.508 --> 03:00:39.969]  But I want to get back to something you said.
[03:00:39.969 --> 03:00:51.614]  You said the spike protein load that's in some of the vaccines, I believe you said Johnson & Johnson or the Janssen in Europe, injects people with about 50 billion particles.
[03:00:51.614 --> 03:00:52.274]  Was that correct?
[03:00:53.050 --> 03:00:55.091]  That's correct.
[03:00:55.091 --> 03:00:58.293]  That doesn't sound like a small amount to me.
[03:00:58.293 --> 03:01:00.935]  That sounds like a massive load.
[03:01:00.935 --> 03:01:13.562]  What are the physiological effects of being hit with that kind of a load of a pro-inflammatory biological weapon developed by the US military and the Chinese military bioweapons departments?
[03:01:15.461 --> 03:01:15.721]  Right.
[03:01:15.721 --> 03:01:17.723]  Well, it's exactly what you would expect it is.
[03:01:17.723 --> 03:01:24.909]  When you have the healthier the person, the more they're able to respond to that because it's your body's looking at that as an infection, right?
[03:01:24.909 --> 03:01:30.154]  It's something coming from outside body that is not supposed to be in your body.
[03:01:30.154 --> 03:01:32.095]  And so it's reacting to that.
[03:01:32.095 --> 03:01:41.023]  And the irony here is that in the past, when we have done vaccines with people, we've taken like influenza and we'll take all the different variants, all the different strains.
[03:01:41.483 --> 03:01:52.512]  We'll weaken them and we'll inject them all together so that when you do that, your body will respond to every type of variant that's in there and all the parts of the virus.
[03:01:52.512 --> 03:01:54.533]  So what did we do this time around?
[03:01:54.533 --> 03:01:57.776]  Instead of putting all the variants, we picked one.
[03:01:57.776 --> 03:02:06.463]  Instead of having the nucleocapsid or the envelope or the HE or any of the other components of this virus, we picked one type of spike protein.
[03:02:06.463 --> 03:02:08.064]  So what are we saying now?
[03:02:08.064 --> 03:02:10.346]  With these massive drug vaccine
[03:02:11.121 --> 03:02:11.301]  I think?
[03:02:29.411 --> 03:02:30.411]  We're not making new ones.
[03:02:30.411 --> 03:02:31.632]  They're already there.
[03:02:31.632 --> 03:02:32.532]  Okay?
[03:02:32.532 --> 03:02:33.592]  That's the point.
[03:02:33.592 --> 03:02:38.593]  We're not, you know, the virus isn't magically coming up with something new.
[03:02:38.593 --> 03:02:49.176]  Because the infection is basically being given to people by an injection to just one type of protein, a spike protein, and no other part of the virus.
[03:02:49.176 --> 03:02:51.596]  That's all we're making a response to.
[03:02:51.596 --> 03:02:54.657]  So, what we've done is... So it's designed to fail.
[03:02:56.683 --> 03:03:00.345]  It sounds like it's designed to fail against the variants.
[03:03:00.345 --> 03:03:04.609]  Right, so as a research scientist, I just look at that and think, what were they thinking?
[03:03:04.609 --> 03:03:08.231]  That's not even intelligent design, okay?
[03:03:08.231 --> 03:03:09.653]  And I think they got caught.
[03:03:09.653 --> 03:03:24.524]  I just think they got caught, and they thought that they had this under control, and now what they have is a wonderful opportunity to keep playing around with it and changing it, because let's be
[03:03:24.977 --> 03:03:26.177]  Let's be right up front.
[03:03:26.177 --> 03:03:31.699]  You don't have to change these viruses a lot to make them substantially different.
[03:03:31.699 --> 03:03:44.703]  Sickle cell anemia is one base change in human beings that produces a different amino acid in the protein that causes the red blood cells to form a sickle shape.
[03:03:44.703 --> 03:03:49.024]  Now, that's an advantage because if you live in an area where there's malaria,
[03:03:49.847 --> 03:03:51.008]  You're going to survive.
[03:03:51.008 --> 03:03:54.209]  You're not going to be an Olympic athlete, but you're going to survive.
[03:03:54.209 --> 03:04:00.371]  So there's a survival advantage for the Delta variant and the Lambda variant coming on the tails of this.
[03:04:00.371 --> 03:04:05.894]  And there's a number of variances, at least 17 right now that we know about with 12 mutational changes.
[03:04:05.894 --> 03:04:14.377]  Every one of these is now being selectively pressured for instead of going back and right, instead of allowing doctors to treat patients.
[03:04:14.377 --> 03:04:15.978]  You know, I said this before.
[03:04:16.874 --> 03:04:19.475]  There are drugs that we've seen that works.
[03:04:19.475 --> 03:04:32.438]  If you go to the website, I've got almost 200 papers now under the virus, looking at a number of things, including medications that have worked for different viruses over the course of history.
[03:04:32.438 --> 03:04:36.159]  And you can see, we have treatments that work.
[03:04:36.159 --> 03:04:40.340]  And the argument that you're gonna cause harm to people, that's nuts.
[03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:45.501]  Because when the way that the government's doing it now... We're gonna go to break again.
[03:04:47.049 --> 03:04:48.771]  I really apologize for interrupting.
[03:04:48.771 --> 03:04:51.773]  We've got heartbreaks here, but FlemingMethod.com is the website.
[03:04:51.773 --> 03:04:53.295]  This is just a short break, one minute break.
[03:04:53.295 --> 03:04:57.618]  We'll be back on the other side to continue with Solutions.
[03:04:57.618 --> 03:04:58.019]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.146 --> 03:05:08.291]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of, where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash?
[03:05:08.291 --> 03:05:16.417]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a bestseller within six months, and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns of the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[03:05:16.417 --> 03:05:19.619]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply.
[03:05:19.619 --> 03:05:20.639]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[03:05:20.639 --> 03:05:22.561]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the InfoWarp.
[03:05:22.561 --> 03:05:25.763]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you are already a fan or you haven't tried it,
[03:05:26.483 --> 03:05:29.204]  It's back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:29.204 --> 03:05:35.665]  Discounted because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[03:05:35.665 --> 03:05:41.467]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places.
[03:05:41.467 --> 03:05:46.608]  InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:05:46.608 --> 03:05:49.649]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[03:05:49.949 --> 03:05:58.018]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with essential oils and more at InfoWarStore.com and fund the InfoWar.
[03:05:58.018 --> 03:05:58.619]  A true 360 win!
[03:06:10.199 --> 03:06:13.240]  All right, final segment with Dr. Richard M. Fleming today.
[03:06:13.240 --> 03:06:15.881]  He's the author of the book, Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?
[03:06:15.881 --> 03:06:20.482]  And thank you again, Dr. Fleming, for your time today and for continuing with us into this segment.
[03:06:20.482 --> 03:06:23.884]  I'm sorry about constantly interrupting you.
[03:06:23.884 --> 03:06:25.244]  That just goes with the territory here.
[03:06:25.244 --> 03:06:28.185]  You've got so much to say, we're barely scratching the surface here.
[03:06:28.185 --> 03:06:29.786]  Your website is FlemingMethod.com.
[03:06:29.786 --> 03:06:34.567]  Now, in this final segment, I want to ask you really two things about solutions.
[03:06:34.567 --> 03:06:36.568]  Number one, what can people do
[03:06:37.268 --> 03:06:45.976]  To prevent systemic or chronic inflammation that may be exacerbated by a spike protein exposure, even if they haven't taken the vaccine.
[03:06:45.976 --> 03:07:02.470]  And then secondly, I want to get into your belief that we talked about in our separate interview, that you believe science will win here and that these fake scientists like Fauci are going down and that there's going to be Nuremberg style trials.
[03:07:02.470 --> 03:07:03.651]  You're optimistic.
[03:07:03.911 --> 03:07:07.133]  That we're going to overcome the lies and the attacks on humanity.
[03:07:07.133 --> 03:07:13.096]  So those two areas, please, sir, if you don't mind, just jump right in.
[03:07:13.096 --> 03:07:13.396]  Right.
[03:07:13.396 --> 03:07:29.865]  So, you know, a couple decades worth of work on heart disease and the inflammatory diseases that plague humanity already showed us that there were a lot of things that people could do by cutting down calories, by cutting down saturated fat, by not eating processed foods, by not eating refined sugar.
[03:07:30.345 --> 03:07:46.318]  I mean the common sense stuff that I think my parents could have told you about and my grandparents but somehow we got away from that as we kind of got into a society where everybody wanted to have more and more things and do less and less physical labor.
[03:07:46.318 --> 03:07:51.362]  So that and exercise and not smoking and not doing the things that are harmful to your body.
[03:07:51.362 --> 03:07:57.086]  Everything by the way that was taken away from people when we got locked down because people didn't go outside and exercise.
[03:07:57.086 --> 03:07:58.087]  They didn't get fresh air.
[03:07:58.547 --> 03:08:01.910]  They ate junk food, they ate garbage, you know.
[03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:10.718]  So there's a lot of things and if you go to the website, actually you can go under answers and then you can go down to flowcharts for doctors and best evidence treatments.
[03:08:10.718 --> 03:08:16.783]  You'll see several vitamins and minerals that people can use that will improve their immune function.
[03:08:16.783 --> 03:08:24.009]  We don't tell anybody, you know, God forbid we actually say that this will help you or treat you, but you know these are things that I think most
[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:28.788]  Biologists and nutritionists will tell you are important for your immune system.
[03:08:28.788 --> 03:08:34.601]  So, doing things that are helpful for your immune system when it's an immune problem seems to be an intelligent idea to me.
[03:08:35.427 --> 03:08:41.590]  But you can see that it's broken down into before symptoms, things that you just want to do to be improving your overall health.
[03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:44.492]  Early symptoms, which sometimes means increasing a little bit.
[03:08:44.492 --> 03:08:48.334]  You know, one of the things about vitamin C is that it's water-soluble.
[03:08:48.334 --> 03:08:54.277]  So, if you start taking more of it, you buy yourself, you know, 72 hours or 3 days before your kidneys kick in.
[03:08:54.277 --> 03:08:59.599]  Unless, of course, they're getting blood clots from inflammatory thrombotic diseases that your doctor is not treating.
[03:09:01.448 --> 03:09:05.870]  There are treatments that are available that, you know, just not me, just not my study.
[03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:12.954]  There's a lot of people that are out there, just even if it's just observational materials, that they're saying, look, we know these drugs work.
[03:09:12.954 --> 03:09:22.919]  And if you go to the website, you can find out how hydroxychloroquine, how primoquine, how clindamycin, how atrovent inhalers, all these drugs work.
[03:09:22.919 --> 03:09:25.060]  It's published research.
[03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:31.103]  So government to say there's not published research on all this is just disingenuous.
[03:09:31.502 --> 03:09:33.984]  And really raises questions about their motives.
[03:09:33.984 --> 03:09:44.210]  And then if you end up developing worse disease with more inflammation and blood clotting, there are things that you can do in the hospital that, you know, slowly but surely is coming out.
[03:09:44.210 --> 03:10:00.220]  But you know, this is now, we're coming into the second year, the end of the second year, and this has been running on way too long with people blocking patients getting treatments and forcing vaccines that not only statistically don't work,
[03:10:01.152 --> 03:10:01.472]  Yes, we are.
[03:10:31.773 --> 03:10:38.816]  Yes, of our cells where our genetic code is and that it closes off or protects the nuclear pore complex.
[03:10:38.816 --> 03:10:44.138]  And so I put this out there based upon best medical evidence, you know, for people to look at.
[03:10:44.138 --> 03:10:47.219]  All of this is for patients and their doctors to look at.
[03:10:47.219 --> 03:10:53.222]  There are people around the world that are using these different protocols, and they're extremely successful.
[03:10:53.222 --> 03:10:56.283]  The work we saw was 99.83% successful, which means out of 1800, we lost three people.
[03:10:59.887 --> 03:11:05.372]  Which would have been about 20,000 deaths in the United States versus 600,000 deaths.
[03:11:05.372 --> 03:11:08.035]  But with 20,000 deaths, you wouldn't have shut down the country.
[03:11:08.035 --> 03:11:09.897]  You wouldn't have had all the mask mandates.
[03:11:09.897 --> 03:11:14.161]  You wouldn't have had the motivation to drive the vaccines out there into people's arms.
[03:11:14.161 --> 03:11:16.563]  You wouldn't have people freaking out because
[03:11:17.461 --> 03:11:18.442]  They simply wouldn't be.
[03:11:18.442 --> 03:11:26.889]  I mean, you know, we have that, probably, I don't know how many deaths we get with influenza every year, but you know, I wouldn't find that an unexpected number.
[03:11:26.889 --> 03:11:31.613]  And now we're talking about putting things in perspective about where this really is.
[03:11:31.613 --> 03:11:44.905]  So even though it's a gain-of-function bioweapon, and kudos to them for doing a really great job and spending tens of millions of dollars and scaring the blazes out of people and manipulating societies, not just the United States, but around the world, because I'll tell you,
[03:11:45.405 --> 03:11:54.770]  I have friends in France, in Italy, in Germany, in the UK, in Norway, in Japan, in Australia, in Canada, that are giving me the exact same story.
[03:11:54.770 --> 03:11:57.511]  And the people are really kind of tired of being manipulated.
[03:11:57.511 --> 03:12:02.174]  This is nothing different than we saw in 1930s Nazi Germany.
[03:12:02.174 --> 03:12:06.296]  And if you ever wonder what you would have done in 1930s Nazi Germany, now you know.
[03:12:07.684 --> 03:12:17.289]  So, what I love about your approach is it's very evidence-based, and you scrutinize the research, you look at the data to draw your conclusions.
[03:12:17.289 --> 03:12:33.858]  And you're right, they expertly built a virus with a spike protein shell, I say, that has high transmissivity, low natural morbidity, except for the spike protein, which is the dangerous part, so they put that into the vaccines.
[03:12:33.858 --> 03:12:34.919]  And then they achieve
[03:12:36.039 --> 03:12:50.328]  In the post-vaccination era, they achieved the mass death that then just feeds the hysteria propaganda cycle that they're pushing to drive people into irrationality, where you have schoolteachers saying that if children come to school without a mask, that they're murderers!
[03:12:50.328 --> 03:13:01.354]  I mean, I couldn't imagine this, but you mentioned Nazi Germany, so in the three minutes we have left, please get into the Nuremberg long-term, you know, are these people going to go to prison?
[03:13:01.354 --> 03:13:03.636]  Are they going to be prosecuted for these crimes against humanity?
[03:13:04.975 --> 03:13:05.355]  Right.
[03:13:05.355 --> 03:13:11.120]  So our goal is to bring cases before the International Criminal Court for a Nuremberg 2.
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:13.101]  And a lot of people have talked about that.
[03:13:13.101 --> 03:13:19.546]  And all I can say right now is you should pay close attention to what comes out in the news during the next few days.
[03:13:19.546 --> 03:13:25.391]  There's going to be a call, a real call.
[03:13:25.391 --> 03:13:29.414]  There are things that have been done that you'll hear about in the next few days.
[03:13:31.320 --> 03:13:41.322]  If you're listening to the right sources, where you will see that all this stuff that I've been talking about, we are going to take this to the International Criminal Court.
[03:13:41.322 --> 03:13:43.102]  I'm not kidding.
[03:13:43.102 --> 03:13:47.423]  Do you think that this, that the perpetrators know this is coming?
[03:13:47.423 --> 03:13:55.585]  They know they can't hide their evidence, and so they are then accelerating their push to achieve the maximum extermination possible before they are exposed?
[03:13:57.762 --> 03:14:06.289]  Well, considering the fact that most of us have been told that there are people tracking us, I would say that they're nervous enough that they're now tracking us.
[03:14:06.289 --> 03:14:13.895]  So people like you and others are being stalked or surveilled or threatened, perhaps?
[03:14:13.895 --> 03:14:14.376]  All of the above?
[03:14:16.571 --> 03:14:19.052]  Yeah, well that's definitely par for the course these days.
[03:14:19.052 --> 03:14:22.613]  And here you are now with incredible reach.
[03:14:22.613 --> 03:14:26.155]  I would just say be safe, watch your back.
[03:14:26.155 --> 03:14:31.336]  People like you and your work in particular is extremely important for the future of humanity.
[03:14:31.336 --> 03:14:31.857]  And I'm with you.
[03:14:31.857 --> 03:14:33.697]  I think we will overcome this as well.
[03:14:33.697 --> 03:14:37.719]  And I also think that medical choice and health freedom is now the greatest civil right.
[03:14:38.479 --> 03:14:40.020]  Well, interestingly enough, black
[03:15:00.922 --> 03:15:08.304]  More risk for this virus, not because of the vitamin D, but because this virus has to attach to five different receptors to get in.
[03:15:08.304 --> 03:15:23.628]  You've heard a lot about ACE2 receptor, but the next one is called Transmembrane Protein Series 2, or TMPRSS2, and black people have more of that in their nose than Asian people who have more of it than white people who have more of it than Jews do.
[03:15:25.595 --> 03:15:26.876]  Wow!
[03:15:26.876 --> 03:15:35.442]  You just opened up a Pandora's box of debate and commentary on that, but we'll have to bring you back to talk about all of that, but wow!
[03:15:35.442 --> 03:15:43.087]  We're out of time, but Dr. Richard Fleming, thank you so much for your work, your courage, and I want to encourage folks to visit your website, FlemingMethod.com.
[03:15:43.527 --> 03:15:46.631]  And check out your book, Is COVID-19 a Bioweapon?

[03:15:49.395 --> 03:15:50.076]  God bless.
[03:15:50.076 --> 03:15:51.338]  Dr. Fleming, be safe.
[03:15:51.338 --> 03:15:52.299]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:15:52.299 --> 03:15:52.920]  Take care.
[03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:54.723]  And we'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:54.723 --> 03:15:55.704]  I'm Mike Adams.

[03:16:29.824 --> 03:16:30.644]  Hey, everybody.
[03:16:30.644 --> 03:16:33.885]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[03:16:33.885 --> 03:16:34.645]  Me too.
[03:16:34.645 --> 03:16:41.746]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[03:16:41.746 --> 03:16:46.147]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[03:16:46.147 --> 03:16:48.047]  You probably already believe that.
[03:16:48.047 --> 03:16:49.047]  I certainly do.
[03:16:49.047 --> 03:16:49.988]  So here's the thing.
[03:16:49.988 --> 03:16:58.309]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[03:16:58.889 --> 03:17:04.313]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[03:17:29.711 --> 03:17:30.952]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:30.952 --> 03:17:34.878]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:34.878 --> 03:17:36.401]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:36.401 --> 03:17:39.365]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:39.365 --> 03:17:44.573]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:44.913 --> 03:17:46.114]  I can help you too.
[03:17:46.114 --> 03:17:49.056]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:49.056 --> 03:17:51.277]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:51.277 --> 03:17:55.720]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[03:18:40.278 --> 03:18:41.318]  Made right here in America.

[03:18:58.621 --> 03:18:59.783]  So thank you so much for your support.
[03:19:00.427 --> 03:19:06.831]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[03:19:06.831 --> 03:19:14.235]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[03:19:14.235 --> 03:19:20.579]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[03:19:21.079 --> 03:19:24.242]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[03:19:24.242 --> 03:19:26.984]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[03:19:26.984 --> 03:19:30.587]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[03:19:30.587 --> 03:19:33.130]  Also described as the seat of the soul.
[03:19:33.130 --> 03:19:36.773]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness.
[03:19:37.373 --> 03:19:39.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:14.818 --> 03:20:21.403]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:20:21.403 --> 03:20:32.933]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:32.933 --> 03:20:41.440]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.285 --> 03:20:46.485]  All right, welcome back.
[03:20:46.485 --> 03:20:50.506]  I'm Mike Adams filling in for Alex here for the remainder of the fourth hour.
[03:20:50.506 --> 03:20:58.528]  We just finished speaking with Dr. Richard M. Fleming, and if you missed that segment, you will definitely want to go back and watch that.
[03:20:58.528 --> 03:21:08.130]  And it's tough, even just having breaks at all, although that's necessary for radio and for this format and to fund the operation.
[03:21:08.130 --> 03:21:13.811]  But when you find someone like Dr. Fleming, who is so well-researched and so brilliant,
[03:21:14.511 --> 03:21:17.812]  You just don't want to ever have him stop talking.
[03:21:17.812 --> 03:21:24.173]  You just want to let him go for 30 minutes because he's got that much information about what's going on.
[03:21:24.173 --> 03:21:28.233]  And I will tell you, I've done a longer form interview with him as well.
[03:21:28.233 --> 03:21:29.934]  That's posted all over the place.
[03:21:29.934 --> 03:21:30.814]  You can find that.
[03:21:30.814 --> 03:21:33.114]  But we're going to have him back on, try to get him back on InfoWars.
[03:21:33.114 --> 03:21:40.336]  And also, I'm reaching out to Dr. Lee Merritt that Alex said he wanted to get her on the show here on InfoWars as well.
[03:21:40.336 --> 03:21:41.576]  So I'm working to make that happen.
[03:21:42.717 --> 03:21:52.399]  Now, the bombshell thing that Dr. Fleming just said in the last segment, it was kind of like, here, have this bomb, and then, you know, it was the break.
[03:21:52.399 --> 03:22:04.502]  He said that if you look at the ethnic breakdown of the receptors, the receptor sites in the nasal passages, and how they are different by ethnicity,
[03:22:05.831 --> 03:22:12.116]  And which, of course, implies that this biological weapon may be targeting certain specific ethnic groups.
[03:22:12.116 --> 03:22:21.264]  I believe what he said, if I'm remembering correctly, was that black Americans have the most receptors, which would mean they're the most vulnerable to this biological weapon.
[03:22:22.268 --> 03:22:24.631]  I think he said Asian Americans.
[03:22:24.631 --> 03:22:28.055]  I guess it wouldn't have to be Americans, just Asians in general.
[03:22:28.055 --> 03:22:31.980]  And then I think he said white people or Caucasians.
[03:22:31.980 --> 03:22:37.767]  And then I think he said at the lowest level of these receptors, he said were people of Jewish descent.
[03:22:38.047 --> 03:22:39.168]  Ethnicity.
[03:22:39.168 --> 03:22:45.794]  And I immediately knew all the online boards and message, you know, discussion boards, social media is going to explode.
[03:22:45.794 --> 03:22:48.196]  So go ahead and do that.
[03:22:48.196 --> 03:22:51.418]  That's going to bring up a lot of discussion all over the place.
[03:22:51.418 --> 03:22:59.445]  But I then remembered that what Dr. Fleming said, I had seen that study about a year ago, and he's right.
[03:22:59.445 --> 03:23:00.926]  It is different.
[03:23:00.926 --> 03:23:05.951]  The vulnerability to the spike protein, including the shedding,
[03:23:07.091 --> 03:23:09.252]  It is different by ethnicity.
[03:23:09.252 --> 03:23:32.807]  And what this means is that if a black person has this spike protein vaccine, that that person could shed the spike protein and have a more devastating effect on the spike protein damage to their relatives or loved ones or people that they share their homes with, let's say.
[03:23:32.807 --> 03:23:35.449]  You know, relatives, friends, spouses, children, whatever.
[03:23:36.209 --> 03:23:45.958]  So once again, we're looking at something that, oh, just by coincidence, happens to target black people more than any other race.
[03:23:45.958 --> 03:23:48.380]  And think about what Alex covered earlier today.
[03:23:49.386 --> 03:24:09.073]  Which is about the organ harvesting from aborted babies who are essentially born alive and then kept alive and their organs are harvested for quote medical research and in those documents it said specifically and I think this is out of the University of Pittsburgh FOIA request if I'm correct on that
[03:24:09.833 --> 03:24:13.794]  That they wanted black babies.
[03:24:13.794 --> 03:24:21.736]  They specifically wanted black babies and they gave special instructions to keep the blood flowing through their organs.
[03:24:21.736 --> 03:24:24.716]  Because they wanted live, quote, fresh organs.
[03:24:24.716 --> 03:24:31.538]  So, folks, this is... 2021 is becoming a museum of horrors.
[03:24:31.538 --> 03:24:37.099]  And a lot of these horrors are targeting the people of African ancestry.
[03:24:38.021 --> 03:24:39.683]  I mean, there's no other way to say it.
[03:24:39.683 --> 03:24:54.482]  Yes, this is a war on humanity, but there are aspects of this war that are genetically targeted genocide against black Americans, black Canadians, people of African descent all over the world.
[03:24:55.481 --> 03:25:09.491]  And then you combine that with the vitamin D deficiency that is chronic across most of modern day, you know, black Americans, black Canadians, especially at the northern cities.
[03:25:09.491 --> 03:25:15.755]  If you live in Boston and you have dark skin pigmentation, you're not getting much vitamin D.
[03:25:16.696 --> 03:25:39.589]  Generated in your skin because your skin is blocking the ultraviolet rays from the Sun as a result as a as a black American or a black Canadian you are going to be more chronically deficient unless unless you you know supplement you're gonna be more deficient in vitamin D Especially in the winter months when all the other people around you are also suffering dwindling vitamin D levels
[03:25:41.152 --> 03:26:04.749]  And this coming winter, I'm very concerned about what's going to happen, because this is when you get into the area of antibody-dependent enhancement, with low vitamin D levels and high pro-inflammation processed foods that Dr. Fleming just warned about, and then the enhanced receptor sites of black Americans.
[03:26:04.749 --> 03:26:07.871]  You could be looking at, or we could be looking at, all of us,
[03:26:09.744 --> 03:26:16.922]  A devastating, genocidal, bioweapons winter against black Americans.
[03:26:18.134 --> 03:26:21.095]  Where the death rate could be absolutely devastating.
[03:26:21.095 --> 03:26:34.939]  And then you know, you know that the CDC and Fauci are going to come along and they're going to blame the black communities and say, well, they're going to say, and they'll probably even use a phrase like you people, you know, just, just to be very condescending.
[03:26:34.939 --> 03:26:37.980]  They'll say, you people didn't take the vaccine.
[03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:40.500]  This is what happens, right?
[03:26:40.500 --> 03:26:43.901]  Because let's face it, these people in charge, they're racist bigots.
[03:26:43.901 --> 03:26:46.142]  They've been trying to kill black babies and black people forever.
[03:26:47.472 --> 03:26:52.181]  And this is why they're running the internment camps, as well, because they're going to target black communities.
[03:26:52.181 --> 03:26:53.783]  But they're probably going to say something like that.
[03:26:53.783 --> 03:26:58.232]  They're going to say, you people are dying because you didn't take the vaccine, see?
[03:26:58.232 --> 03:26:58.392]  No.
[03:26:59.454 --> 03:27:03.137]  It's because the bioweapon is targeting black people.
[03:27:03.137 --> 03:27:10.722]  It's because the medical establishment deliberately refuses to tell black people that you're vitamin D deficient.
[03:27:10.722 --> 03:27:20.929]  And if you don't address that issue, you're going to be more vulnerable to cancer, to diabetes, to blood sugar, high blood pressure disorders.
[03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:25.753]  You're going to be more vulnerable to the spike protein inflammation.
[03:27:25.753 --> 03:27:26.854]  So if there's any message
[03:27:27.654 --> 03:27:30.215]  That needs to get out today.
[03:27:30.215 --> 03:27:52.723]  And I don't know any better way to do it than to be right here on InfoWars with this crucial message that anyone who has darker skin pigmentation, who may be vitamin D deficient, who is of African ethnicity in your ancestry, even a portion of your ancestry, you need to get this message out and you need to take this to heart yourself.
[03:27:52.723 --> 03:27:56.204]  Get your nutrition in order because you are being targeted.
[03:27:57.298 --> 03:28:03.140]  You are being targeted by biological weapons that are specifically designed to kill you first.
[03:28:03.140 --> 03:28:08.242]  You're being targeted by an abortion industry that's designed to kill your babies and stop you from reproducing.
[03:28:08.242 --> 03:28:15.645]  You're being targeted by a government that I would say is acting as terrorists against the black communities.
[03:28:15.645 --> 03:28:20.587]  And you know the history of the FBI targeting black Americans with acts of terrorism.
[03:28:20.587 --> 03:28:26.029]  That was nothing compared to what's being done now on a biowarfare level.
[03:28:26.932 --> 03:28:34.575]  And also understand, do not let these globalists drive a wedge between any of us based on our skin color, or race, or ethnicity, or anything.
[03:28:34.575 --> 03:28:36.375]  Because we are all in this together.
[03:28:36.375 --> 03:28:40.897]  We're human beings, and we must join hands and fight this together.
[03:28:40.897 --> 03:28:42.817]  Fight for humanity.
[03:28:42.817 --> 03:28:47.819]  Against the mad murderers who are trying to kill us all, but they really want to kill you if you're black.
[03:28:48.755 --> 03:28:50.517]  They're going to get around to killing the white people, too.
[03:28:50.517 --> 03:28:51.498]  Don't worry.
[03:28:51.498 --> 03:28:53.341]  But you're first.
[03:28:53.341 --> 03:28:54.642]  So we must defend this together.
[03:28:54.642 --> 03:28:55.283]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:55.283 --> 03:28:56.064]  I'm Mike Adams here.
[03:28:56.064 --> 03:28:57.686]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:57.686 --> 03:28:58.107]  Stay with us.
[03:28:59.636 --> 03:29:13.507]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:29:13.507 --> 03:29:18.851]  And I, you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:29:18.851 --> 03:29:19.532]  But it's true.
[03:29:19.532 --> 03:29:22.934]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:29:23.695 --> 03:29:26.178]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:29:26.178 --> 03:29:28.240]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:30.002]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:29:30.002 --> 03:29:30.863]  And we're still here.
[03:29:30.863 --> 03:29:35.287]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:29:35.287 --> 03:29:36.929]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:29:36.929 --> 03:29:39.051]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:29:39.051 --> 03:29:42.855]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:29:43.456 --> 03:29:44.536]  You can't have InfoWars.
[03:29:44.536 --> 03:29:48.558]  It's been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:29:48.558 --> 03:29:50.678]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:29:50.678 --> 03:29:51.979]  So thank you all.
[03:29:51.979 --> 03:29:53.319]  And get into InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:53.319 --> 03:29:56.800]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:29:56.800 --> 03:29:58.561]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:29:58.561 --> 03:29:58.821]  Thank you.
[03:30:04.372 --> 03:30:05.532]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:30:05.532 --> 03:30:06.353]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:30:06.353 --> 03:30:07.473]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:30:07.473 --> 03:30:07.993]  Go ahead.
[03:30:07.993 --> 03:30:08.533]  Hey, Alex.
[03:30:08.533 --> 03:30:11.154]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[03:30:11.154 --> 03:30:12.194]  I am a granny.
[03:30:12.194 --> 03:30:21.857]  And for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[03:30:21.857 --> 03:30:27.859]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[03:30:27.859 --> 03:30:28.899]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[03:30:30.920 --> 03:30:31.301]  Yeah.
[03:30:31.301 --> 03:30:38.867]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[03:30:38.867 --> 03:30:47.614]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[03:30:47.614 --> 03:30:48.455]  This is working.
[03:30:48.455 --> 03:30:49.436]  This is wonderful.
[03:30:49.436 --> 03:30:53.980]  You know, I don't I don't have to put it on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[03:30:53.980 --> 03:30:58.644]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[03:31:00.376 --> 03:31:07.880]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:31:07.880 --> 03:31:13.402]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:31:13.402 --> 03:31:20.986]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:31:21.266 --> 03:31:22.727]  Humanity is strong.
[03:31:22.727 --> 03:31:23.687]  We're incredible.
[03:31:23.687 --> 03:31:27.468]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:31:27.468 --> 03:31:29.949]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:31:29.949 --> 03:31:35.911]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:31:35.911 --> 03:31:45.614]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:31:45.934 --> 03:31:48.256]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:48.256 --> 03:31:50.898]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:31:50.898 --> 03:31:56.243]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[03:31:56.243 --> 03:32:00.567]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[03:32:00.567 --> 03:32:08.894]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[03:32:09.818 --> 03:32:15.001]  We had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[03:32:15.001 --> 03:32:18.844]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[03:32:18.844 --> 03:32:22.146]  But when it comes to media, InfoWars has been the tip of that spear.
[03:32:22.146 --> 03:32:30.391]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[03:32:30.391 --> 03:32:33.814]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code ALEX,
[03:32:34.594 --> 03:32:38.116]  You get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.

[03:32:41.377 --> 03:32:46.219]  And then you fund InfoWars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalists.
[03:32:46.219 --> 03:32:50.541]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[03:32:50.541 --> 03:32:56.704]  And if you do it, it funds the InfoWars, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[03:32:56.704 --> 03:32:59.325]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[03:32:59.325 --> 03:33:00.146]  Take action now.
[03:33:03.187 --> 03:33:05.820]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.794 --> 03:33:23.536]  I've got some exclusive information coming up for you here.
[03:33:23.536 --> 03:33:29.701]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the fourth hour today of the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:29.701 --> 03:33:31.123]  I thank you for continuing with me.
[03:33:31.123 --> 03:33:34.986]  It's just bombshell after bombshell, and it's not slowing down.
[03:33:34.986 --> 03:33:42.772]  Now, like many other people in this independent media space, I have a lot of contacts, and some of them are inside the establishment.
[03:33:43.753 --> 03:33:47.935]  And even they are completely freaking out about what's going on.
[03:33:47.935 --> 03:33:52.438]  And they will sometimes give me information, little hints, nothing.
[03:33:52.438 --> 03:33:56.540]  They don't send me, like, top-secret documents, because they don't want to get me killed, you know.
[03:33:56.540 --> 03:34:02.122]  But they'll send me little tidbits of perspectives or analysis of things that are going on.
[03:34:02.122 --> 03:34:08.326]  And some of the information I came across recently I'm going to share with you right here, that it may sound
[03:34:09.803 --> 03:34:16.128]  Bizarre, but I believe it to be accurate, so I'm going to lay it out for you here, and you can make up your own mind, but here it is.
[03:34:16.128 --> 03:34:28.397]  It is that the globalists who are running this entire global depopulation, COVID, scandemic situation, that they are actually very frustrated right now.
[03:34:29.358 --> 03:34:38.305]  Because, for an odd reason, they're trying to provoke a nationwide uprising among the American people, and they have so far failed to do so.
[03:34:38.305 --> 03:34:51.156]  Now, again, this is not a mainstream theory, obviously, but they want to provoke an uprising, and this is why they're trying to bring down the hammer every day, announcing some new tyranny.
[03:34:51.156 --> 03:34:53.117]  Oh, we're going to vaccinate the children!
[03:34:53.117 --> 03:34:55.139]  We're going to vaccinate the school teachers!
[03:34:55.139 --> 03:34:56.060]  You're not going to be able to
[03:34:56.520 --> 03:35:00.862]  Go to a grocery store in California, right, if you don't have your vaccine passport.
[03:35:00.862 --> 03:35:02.242]  They're making it insane.
[03:35:02.242 --> 03:35:04.783]  Let's launch COVID camps.
[03:35:04.783 --> 03:35:06.904]  Let's drag people out of their homes.
[03:35:06.904 --> 03:35:11.145]  The reason they're doing this, again, they're trying to provoke an uprising.
[03:35:11.145 --> 03:35:14.607]  They're trying to get millions of people marching in the streets.
[03:35:14.607 --> 03:35:15.947]  But why, you ask?
[03:35:15.947 --> 03:35:16.848]  Why?
[03:35:16.848 --> 03:35:17.688]  What's behind that?
[03:35:18.726 --> 03:35:31.758]  According to my sources, it's because they need the backdrop of mass protests in order to launch their epic false flag, bloody attack on whatever they're going to attack.
[03:35:31.758 --> 03:35:43.508]  I've been told it might be a medical institution or group or something like that, because they want to falsely place the blame on anti-vaxxers for terrorism.
[03:35:44.329 --> 03:35:49.430]  And in order to blame anti-vaxxers who they also are bundling with gun owners now.
[03:35:49.430 --> 03:35:55.752]  So what they really want is that they want a mass uprising across America.
[03:35:55.752 --> 03:36:07.994]  They want then crowds in major cities like hundreds of thousands of people marching around and then they can manipulate that scene to put in their own operatives who will dress up in MAGA gear.
[03:36:07.994 --> 03:36:10.075]  I mean, folks, this is basically like a January 6th
[03:36:11.095 --> 03:36:16.337]  You know, rerun, except this time targeting so-called anti-vaxxers.
[03:36:16.337 --> 03:36:19.318]  That's what this is going to be, if they can pull it off.
[03:36:19.318 --> 03:36:32.943]  So then they, the Deep State, will stage some kind of attack, something, I don't know exactly what that's supposed to be, and then they'll roll out the narrative, CNN cameras will be ready like they were for Roger Stone's house raid, you know.
[03:36:32.943 --> 03:36:35.444]  Oh, we just happened to be there, what do you know?
[03:36:35.444 --> 03:36:38.966]  And then they're going to blame anti-vaxxers, and then
[03:36:40.123 --> 03:36:47.912]  They think that that will justify Biden if he's still in the Oval Office, which is increasingly doubtful.
[03:36:47.912 --> 03:36:54.861]  But someone there will invoke the Insurrection Act against anti-vaxxers and folks.
[03:36:54.861 --> 03:36:56.343]  This is why.
[03:36:56.343 --> 03:36:58.906]  This is why the CDC is readying the COVID camps.
[03:37:00.200 --> 03:37:12.371]  They plan to, according to my sources, again you decide whether this makes sense to you, they plan to deploy the United States military, that is, the ones that aren't yet dead from the vaccine shots.
[03:37:13.448 --> 03:37:19.971]  On the streets of America, in the cities of America, running checkpoints on the highways of America.
[03:37:19.971 --> 03:37:24.052]  And I have this from multiple sources about the highway checkpoints.
[03:37:24.052 --> 03:37:28.174]  They're going to have show-me-your-vaccine-papers checkpoints on the highways.
[03:37:28.174 --> 03:37:30.375]  And they're going to be augmented by drones.
[03:37:32.286 --> 03:37:36.707]  Aerial surveillance drones that can follow cars that try to run away from this.
[03:37:36.707 --> 03:37:53.932]  And if you are stopped at one of these vaccine papers checkpoints, and you don't have your vaccine papers in order, because it's all becoming a medical Nazi Germany now, they're going to drag you away and throw you in a CDC-run COVID death camp.
[03:37:53.932 --> 03:37:57.173]  And you will never emerge from that COVID death camp.
[03:37:57.173 --> 03:37:59.354]  And by the way, I know Alex covered this a couple days ago,
[03:38:00.356 --> 03:38:14.808]  But the CDC COVID camps, remember the CDC's announced these last year, their document announced them, and they said that they were going to meet quote, minimum humanitarian standards.
[03:38:14.808 --> 03:38:16.949]  All right, so wow, yippee for them.
[03:38:16.949 --> 03:38:27.478]  They're going to meet minimum standards, which in their view is they're going to throw you a roll of toilet paper and a bar of soap and scream at you to clean your prison cell, prisoner.
[03:38:27.478 --> 03:38:29.279]  That's minimum humanitarian standards.
[03:38:30.117 --> 03:38:34.640]  You're going to get a bar of soap and a roll of toilet paper as you die.
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:41.505]  Or maybe later get marched into some other labor camp or prison camp or just execution alley, you know.
[03:38:41.505 --> 03:38:51.771]  And by the way, the CDC admits in their own document that the people who are going to be taking these camps, which they call green zones, by the way, and it doesn't mean it has to be tents.
[03:38:51.771 --> 03:38:53.693]  They said they're going to use local schools.
[03:38:54.835 --> 03:39:05.296]  the local buildings to set up these camps and they said no one's gonna be allowed in or out of these camps are going to be prison camps okay and and they even said
[03:39:07.264 --> 03:39:12.566]  That when you're in these camps, you're going to have to engage in forced labor.
[03:39:12.566 --> 03:39:18.929]  You're going to have to take care of the other camp prisoners who may suffer from physical disabilities.
[03:39:18.929 --> 03:39:20.030]  That's what they said.
[03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:24.852]  If someone's in there in a wheelchair, the other prisoners have to take care of that person.
[03:39:24.852 --> 03:39:31.375]  They're throwing you behind a barbed wire or razor wire wall, in essence, and saying you don't come out.
[03:39:32.802 --> 03:39:38.885]  And this is all coming down and it starts with provoking a mass uprising.
[03:39:38.885 --> 03:39:45.329]  So let me just review the chain of events here that I'm being told will take place if we let them get away with this.
[03:39:45.329 --> 03:39:45.869]  So once again...
[03:39:47.658 --> 03:39:53.120]  The globalists and the puppets in charge of America, they're trying to provoke a reaction?
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:39:56.561]  They want the mass uprising in the streets?
[03:39:56.561 --> 03:40:07.324]  Even though you and I would call for peaceful protests, they would of course have their operatives, they would be armed, they would do crazy things, caught on camera, to push the false flag narrative that anti-vaxxers are dangerous.
[03:40:07.984 --> 03:40:08.884]  They would call them terrorists.
[03:40:08.884 --> 03:40:10.325]  They would invoke the Insurrection Act.
[03:40:10.325 --> 03:40:11.806]  They would deploy the military on U.S.
[03:40:11.806 --> 03:40:13.827]  streets and highway checkpoints.
[03:40:13.827 --> 03:40:22.071]  And at that time, by the way, the FDA would have already authorized, fully approved the Pfizer vaccine, which is expected to happen in early September.
[03:40:22.071 --> 03:40:28.174]  And then they can roll out mandatory vaccine passports on a nationwide basis, according to Biden.
[03:40:29.835 --> 03:40:44.721]  Now, and then they can arrest people at the checkpoints and rip you away from your work, your home, your family, your community, and throw you in these COVID camps, which the CDC document admits will cause extreme psychological trauma and mental health trauma.
[03:40:44.721 --> 03:40:45.481]  That's in their document.
[03:40:46.334 --> 03:40:49.255]  They know that that's what this is going to cause.
[03:40:49.255 --> 03:40:50.495]  And then they're going to kill you.
[03:40:50.495 --> 03:40:54.197]  So this is a torture system to exterminate people.
[03:40:54.197 --> 03:41:01.099]  And they also say, by the way, that the people who will be taken to those camps are, quote, high-risk individuals.
[03:41:01.099 --> 03:41:04.620]  Well, what's considered a high-risk individual, I ask you?
[03:41:04.620 --> 03:41:06.801]  Well, according to the media and Biden,
[03:41:07.777 --> 03:41:14.823]  And all of the cartel criminals going along with this, anyone who's unvaccinated, they would say is a high-risk individual.
[03:41:14.823 --> 03:41:16.745]  So you see, they've already laid the groundwork.
[03:41:16.745 --> 03:41:25.232]  If you're not vaccinated, you're going to be considered a terrorist, a threat to public health, maybe an anti-government person.
[03:41:25.232 --> 03:41:28.875]  And they're going to round you up, then get away with it and try to exterminate you.
[03:41:29.963 --> 03:41:34.907]  Now I don't think they're going to get away with this in a lot of red states.
[03:41:34.907 --> 03:41:38.751]  Try the checkpoints in Texas and see how that goes.
[03:41:38.751 --> 03:41:44.516]  I don't think that's going to go real well in a lot of states, but in other states they will absolutely get away with it.
[03:41:44.516 --> 03:41:49.040]  California, Oregon, Washington, New Jersey, New York, Illinois.
[03:41:50.231 --> 03:41:53.072]  For example, so this is coming, folks.
[03:41:53.072 --> 03:41:54.132]  I believe this is coming.
[03:41:54.132 --> 03:41:59.974]  I think this is a legitimate, accurate analysis of why they're trying to provoke people.
[03:41:59.974 --> 03:42:01.074]  I mean, it doesn't make sense.
[03:42:01.074 --> 03:42:09.637]  Why would you announce a coming mandatory lockdown, insane lockdowns, maybe restrictions on the days of the week that grocery stores can be open?
[03:42:09.637 --> 03:42:10.637]  Why would you do that?
[03:42:10.637 --> 03:42:13.398]  Because they want the American people to rise up.
[03:42:13.398 --> 03:42:16.478]  They need the marching in the streets.
[03:42:16.478 --> 03:42:18.079]  And frankly, they're probably going to get it.
[03:42:19.167 --> 03:42:21.768]  The American people are just about at their limit, and that's all by design.
[03:42:21.768 --> 03:42:24.010]  This has all been engineered.
[03:42:24.010 --> 03:42:30.353]  We're all being herded like cattle into an extermination, euthanasia agenda.
[03:42:30.353 --> 03:42:30.913]  Okay?
[03:42:30.913 --> 03:42:33.475]  And that's why we're trying to decode all this for you.
[03:42:33.475 --> 03:42:40.859]  So that you and I, and the people that we can influence and help save, don't get caught up in this death camp scenario.
[03:42:40.859 --> 03:42:44.521]  Because it's coming, and they're going to kill maybe tens of millions of people.
[03:42:46.027 --> 03:42:47.448]  All right, stay with us.
[03:42:47.448 --> 03:42:50.852]  I'll have some more for you on the other side, including some preparedness strategies.
[03:42:50.852 --> 03:42:52.834]  I'm Mike Adams here for InfoWars.com.
[03:42:52.834 --> 03:42:53.975]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.975 --> 03:42:55.056]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:42:59.389 --> 03:43:13.041]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at InfoWarsStore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.

[03:43:46.297 --> 03:43:50.361]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[03:43:50.361 --> 03:43:56.546]  So get your bottle of the new Activated Charcoal Mouthwash right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:43:59.201 --> 03:44:02.766]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically, I was 275 pounds.
[03:44:02.766 --> 03:44:04.248]  I was overweight.
[03:44:04.248 --> 03:44:06.531]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[03:44:06.531 --> 03:44:08.474]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[03:44:08.474 --> 03:44:10.957]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[03:44:10.957 --> 03:44:13.721]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[03:44:13.721 --> 03:44:14.142]  And it worked
[03:44:14.943 --> 03:44:15.483]  Pretty good.
[03:44:15.483 --> 03:44:21.528]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[03:44:21.528 --> 03:44:28.234]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[03:44:28.234 --> 03:44:29.295]  I could think again.
[03:44:29.295 --> 03:44:31.136]  I could connect with people again.
[03:44:31.136 --> 03:44:37.501]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[03:44:37.501 --> 03:44:39.883]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[03:44:39.883 --> 03:44:41.785]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[03:44:41.785 --> 03:44:44.006]  It'll literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[03:44:44.006 --> 03:44:44.567]  It's amazing.
[03:44:44.727 --> 03:44:45.248]  It works.
[03:44:45.248 --> 03:44:47.791]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[03:44:47.791 --> 03:44:54.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:55.262]  Beautifully said, brother.
[03:44:55.262 --> 03:44:57.164]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[03:45:00.165 --> 03:45:12.191]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[03:45:12.191 --> 03:45:19.295]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:45:19.295 --> 03:45:21.176]  Their first product they are launching is called
[03:45:21.516 --> 03:45:26.457]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:45:26.457 --> 03:45:31.278]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[03:45:31.278 --> 03:45:33.238]  This stuff lives in your septic system.

[03:46:00.231 --> 03:46:08.375]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of, where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash?
[03:46:08.375 --> 03:46:16.500]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a bestseller within six months, and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[03:46:16.500 --> 03:46:19.701]  Finally, it came back in, a limited supply.
[03:46:19.701 --> 03:46:20.722]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[03:46:20.722 --> 03:46:22.643]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the InfoWarp.
[03:46:22.643 --> 03:46:25.845]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you're already a fan, or if you haven't tried it,

[03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:05.334]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:23.991 --> 03:47:26.792]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour, final segment.
[03:47:26.792 --> 03:47:33.956]  I'm Mike Adams here of NaturalNews.com, filling in for just one more segment.
[03:47:33.956 --> 03:47:36.978]  So, we've got even a lot to cover here in this last segment.
[03:47:36.978 --> 03:47:45.362]  Now, I know today's show, just from the very start, from hour one all the way through to this, this is a lot of bombshell information to absorb.
[03:47:46.929 --> 03:48:04.032]  What I've got to present to you here is a bigger picture analysis of the vulnerabilities of human civilization, the complexity of society, and how complex societies can be easily taken down by targeting what I call the human infrastructure.
[03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:08.841]  So, this is probably going to blow your mind yet again.
[03:48:08.841 --> 03:48:13.743]  You might have to watch this whole show today a couple of times, but here we go.
[03:48:13.743 --> 03:48:18.365]  So, complex civilizations have very few redundancies.
[03:48:19.540 --> 03:48:24.142]  And what it means is they rely on strong specialization.
[03:48:24.142 --> 03:48:26.163]  People are experts in certain things.
[03:48:26.163 --> 03:48:29.505]  Some people are experts in repairing power grid substations.
[03:48:29.505 --> 03:48:33.707]  Other people are experts in transportation logistics.
[03:48:33.707 --> 03:48:39.330]  People are experts in medicine or in telecommunications technology and so on.
[03:48:40.461 --> 03:48:53.325]  Now, when these societies function well, all of the specialization leads to very strong efficiencies and increases in the quality of life for the citizens who are living under that system.
[03:48:53.325 --> 03:49:00.887]  Because you have even efficiencies in agriculture, where one or two percent of the population can grow the food for the entire population.
[03:49:01.607 --> 03:49:11.630]  And that allows other people to become experts in their specific areas to achieve developments in physics or biochemistry or medicine or technology or what have you.
[03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:20.952]  Now, in contrast to that, very simple societies, which we may call flat societies, have very little specialization.
[03:49:20.952 --> 03:49:29.014]  They tend to be agrarian in nature, which means in those societies most people grow their own food or they're capable of growing their own food.
[03:49:30.265 --> 03:49:44.484]  And for example, when I live in Ecuador, there are many rural areas of Ecuador and Bolivia and Peru and Chile, other parts of South America, lots of parts of even Central America and Mexico as well, where the people are very, very resilient.
[03:49:45.145 --> 03:49:52.107]  Because they all know how to grow their own food, they all know how to do basic repairs of power lines and things like that.
[03:49:52.107 --> 03:49:55.427]  They don't have a complex society in those regions.
[03:49:55.427 --> 03:50:02.929]  I'm not saying that those countries aren't high-tech, but just in the rural regions, they tend to live very simple lives.
[03:50:02.929 --> 03:50:11.931]  Even in the high-altitude Andes Mountains in those regions, I personally visited the Native Indians, as they're called, in Peru.
[03:50:12.931 --> 03:50:21.256]  And I watched them engage in high-altitude farming of papas, which are the potatoes, and quinoa even.
[03:50:21.256 --> 03:50:27.640]  And they would use a beast of burden, the oxen, pulling a wooden plow.
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:36.486]  And so they don't need tractors, they don't need diesel fuel refineries, and their homes are made out of mud bricks.
[03:50:36.486 --> 03:50:40.309]  Okay, I've been there, I've talked to these folks firsthand, I live there.
[03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:45.692]  And they're very low-tech societies, but they're very resilient.
[03:50:45.692 --> 03:50:55.898]  If there's an EMP attack, if the power grid goes down, if the ports are nuked and there's no more imports and exports, guess what?
[03:50:55.898 --> 03:50:58.740]  The high-altitude Indians of Ecuador and Peru
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:00.481]  They wouldn't even notice.
[03:51:00.481 --> 03:51:02.143]  Their lifestyle never even changes.
[03:51:02.143 --> 03:51:05.406]  Or even places like Papua New Guinea, for example.
[03:51:05.406 --> 03:51:12.032]  Very agrarian society with widespread basic skills or farming skills, food skills among the population.
[03:51:12.032 --> 03:51:20.340]  They are not susceptible to systemic collapse because they can always grow their own food and they can take care of themselves.
[03:51:20.340 --> 03:51:21.501]  Common skills.
[03:51:21.501 --> 03:51:24.103]  Now, contrast that to our modern-day world.
[03:51:25.239 --> 03:51:30.083]  We are highly vulnerable because of our specialization and our lack of redundancies.
[03:51:30.083 --> 03:51:38.309]  How many people do you know in America, or maybe you're watching from the UK or Canada, how many people do you know who could grow their own diet?
[03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:39.570]  Almost no one, probably.
[03:51:39.570 --> 03:51:47.357]  Now, certainly people can augment their farming and food production, but how many could really sustain themselves from growing their own food?
[03:51:47.357 --> 03:51:51.120]  How many people know how to plow a field with an animal pulling the plow?
[03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:52.581]  Seriously, how many people know that?
[03:51:53.914 --> 03:51:59.078]  Maybe not even 1 in 10,000 in these nations like the United States.
[03:51:59.078 --> 03:52:20.814]  And so, the vulnerability becomes the human infrastructure, where if a foreign enemy is able to attack the people, and take them out, and cause widespread injury or death, then they collapse the efficiencies of a highly complex structured society.
[03:52:21.894 --> 03:52:29.099]  And in fact, the more complex you are, the more vulnerable you are to collapse when the human infrastructure is assaulted.
[03:52:29.099 --> 03:52:32.481]  And folks, this is exactly what's happening with the spike protein.
[03:52:32.481 --> 03:52:35.163]  They're attacking the human infrastructure.
[03:52:35.163 --> 03:52:40.527]  They're taking out the people who know how to make these complex systems run.
[03:52:40.527 --> 03:52:45.851]  And when they do this, past a certain tipping point, these complex systems will
[03:52:47.412 --> 03:52:49.233]  Spontaneously fail.
[03:52:49.233 --> 03:52:59.697]  They will fail, and then you will thrust the country back into maybe an 18th century existence, which would mean a population reduction of at least 90% in the United States.
[03:52:59.697 --> 03:53:10.280]  So they could kill, if they manage to achieve this, they could theoretically kill 300 million people or so, and just plunge America back into a third world existence.
[03:53:12.331 --> 03:53:16.473]  I hope they don't succeed in that, and I don't think they will, but that is their plan.
[03:53:16.473 --> 03:53:26.539]  But it's important for all of us to understand the vulnerabilities of this highly complex society, because the answer to that is, of course, prepping.
[03:53:26.539 --> 03:53:39.746]  So when you're a prepper, which means having the ability to survive without the conveniences of a highly complex society, which means having your own stored food, having the ability to grow some of your own food, to get back into gardening and food
[03:53:40.526 --> 03:53:40.946]  I don't think so.
[03:53:54.727 --> 03:53:56.307]  Without the municipal water system.
[03:53:56.307 --> 03:54:01.929]  Without centralized hospitals and pharmacies and all these other medical systems.
[03:54:01.929 --> 03:54:09.871]  And if you have the ability to operate and defend yourself without centralized police protection, because you're going to call 9-1-1, the call's not even going to go through.
[03:54:09.871 --> 03:54:14.072]  Not that there's not going to be anybody there to answer it.
[03:54:14.072 --> 03:54:16.032]  Or maybe they'll answer it and laugh at you.
[03:54:16.032 --> 03:54:20.453]  I'm here, there's 50 people raiding our community and they'll just laugh at you.
[03:54:20.453 --> 03:54:21.054]  Yeah, that's us.
[03:54:22.982 --> 03:54:24.843]  You're not even going to get a call through.
[03:54:24.843 --> 03:54:45.276]  But if you can survive off-grid with food, with self-defense, with money, real money, which is gold and silver, for example, in an off-grid situation, or barter, you know, 22 long rifle ammos, a great barter item, and so on, then you can be very resilient against the systemic collapse of society that's being engineered.
[03:54:46.417 --> 03:54:52.304]  So prepping is now more important than ever, and I think you get that watching this, but the average American is oblivious to all this.
[03:54:52.304 --> 03:54:53.185]  They're still not prepping.
[03:54:53.185 --> 03:54:57.630]  They think we're going to go back to normal if they're just obedient enough.
[03:54:57.630 --> 03:54:58.651]  And that's never going to happen.
[03:54:58.651 --> 03:55:01.734]  Now, there's one more aspect to this, which is that the corporations
[03:55:02.615 --> 03:55:08.160]  The global corporations are mass murdering their own people through vaccine mandates.
[03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:11.583]  So they are attacking their own human infrastructure.
[03:55:11.583 --> 03:55:13.865]  And you might say, well, why would they do that?
[03:55:13.865 --> 03:55:18.348]  Why does Facebook or Google or YouTube or Twitter?
[03:55:18.348 --> 03:55:20.851]  Why are they demanding mandatory vaccines?
[03:55:20.851 --> 03:55:21.171]  Why?
[03:55:21.171 --> 03:55:24.373]  I think one airline is demanding mandatory vaccines of their own people.
[03:55:25.256 --> 03:55:26.136]  Why?
[03:55:26.136 --> 03:55:29.898]  Well, number one, they're being ordered to do that by the globalists who are trying to exterminate humanity.
[03:55:29.898 --> 03:55:39.862]  But in the case of big tech, they had always planned to replace their human resources with automation systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
[03:55:39.862 --> 03:55:45.604]  And they're now ready to make that transition, which means that they've used up and exploited the humans for long enough.
[03:55:45.604 --> 03:55:52.227]  And now they would rather them die because dead humans don't sue corporations over vaccine mandates, do they?
[03:55:53.067 --> 03:55:55.908]  Dead humans don't collect retirement benefits.
[03:55:55.908 --> 03:56:05.251]  Dead humans don't speak out about the horrors of their working conditions under wokeism or communism inside these companies.
[03:56:05.251 --> 03:56:12.493]  So a lot of these left-wing tech companies are very happy to mass murder their own people and get rid of them as quickly as possible.
[03:56:12.493 --> 03:56:20.116]  They don't want another, you know, Zach Voorhees to emerge and to be able to tell the truth about what's actually happening in big tech, right?
[03:56:21.167 --> 03:56:23.428]  So this is why it's happening.
[03:56:23.428 --> 03:56:27.010]  And for airlines, they know they're going to get bailout money anyway.
[03:56:27.010 --> 03:56:31.472]  Believe me, the airline owners are not in the business to transport people.
[03:56:31.472 --> 03:56:33.353]  They're in business to make money.
[03:56:33.353 --> 03:56:37.135]  If they just get paid by the government, they don't care if they transport anybody.
[03:56:37.135 --> 03:56:38.596]  That was just a means to an end.
[03:56:38.596 --> 03:56:45.640]  If they just get billions or tens of billions of dollars of payouts, they don't need to transport anybody.
[03:56:45.640 --> 03:56:50.002]  Why should they have to actually work for money if they're just going to get free money from the government?
[03:56:51.124 --> 03:56:56.088]  Now, of course, financial collapse is being engineered by the endless money printing.
[03:56:56.088 --> 03:57:07.517]  Now, what, $3.5 trillion in additional COVID stimulus money that they say is being invested in, quote, infrastructure, while they're attacking the human infrastructure that really powers society.
[03:57:07.517 --> 03:57:10.058]  So you see, they're killing the people who have the knowledge.
[03:57:10.839 --> 03:57:19.302]  While they're collapsing the money supply in order to impoverish and devastate everyone while they steal and loot every last asset into their own hands.
[03:57:19.302 --> 03:57:23.864]  That's the real plan for all of us, and that's why it's critical to stay informed.
