[00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:17.391]  Infowars.
[00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:18.572]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:19.032]  Today.
[00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:19.572]  The
[00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:42.797]  Chief Medical Officer would be identifying the persons who are already vaccinated so that we can get them on the ship.
[00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:46.540]  You see there's a ship in the harbour?
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.720]  Two of them there now.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.161]  Good.
[00:00:49.161 --> 00:01:01.529]  And... We... The ships don't have enough personnel.
[00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.183]  At the moment, to keep people on the ships.
[00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:15.726]  But they have enough personnel to transport persons to these destinations.
[00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:33.233]  But Simone Giza Beach tells me that what she wants to do is to ... The Chief Medical Officer is that those who are vaccinated, she can get them going there on the vessel.
[00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:44.628]  Those on the ships, those who go to particular destinations, if they choose to, this is a voluntary business.
[00:01:44.628 --> 00:02:00.263]  Those who are not yet vaccinated, but who would be vaccinated, you would move on to send them
[00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:12.862]  Immediately after vaccination, you don't want to hold them, keep them for a day or two, because if you ... Some persons upon vaccination, you know, they develop an itch, a little woosiness in the head.
[00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:15.443]  You know how that is?
[00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:16.003]  Some people.
[00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.164]  So you would like to keep them there, so there's two days and so on.
[00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:24.746]  So there are some matters which have to be dealt with.
[00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:25.406]  And then the ...
[00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:35.111]  The ships are doing... There's certain things we have to do with them.
[00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:43.676]  But the... All over the world, the IMF and World Bank are in control.
[00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:47.198]  The Rothschilds are in command.
[00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:57.644]  And they were saying that we're going to put an experimental vaccine that changes your very DNA in your body that's linked to massive death, sterilization, neurological disorders, and of course death.
[00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:06.563]  Or you won't be able to have a job, leave your house, get on a train, get on a bus, get on an airplane, go to a bar, go to a restaurant.
[00:03:06.563 --> 00:03:09.884]  And now, if you're on an island nation, like St.
[00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:19.509]  Vincent, that's had four eruptions, a volcano burning down part of the island, well, you're not allowed to leave until you've had that shot.
[00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.411]  And as most of the Caribbean's still shut down with the whole COVID hoax, it's simply incredible.
[00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.272]  But everything's okay, folks, because look,
[00:03:25.913 --> 00:03:28.274]  Look at this chilling photo of your TV viewer.
[00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:32.116]  It's on the puppet vice president's Twitter.
[00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:35.338]  Brighter days are ahead.
[00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:39.661]  The real president's not allowed on Twitter, but, you know, he didn't realize the threat of the full takeover.
[00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:41.001]  He still thought he lived in America.
[00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:45.124]  But, oh, brighter days are ahead, meaning Joe Biden, the puppet, will soon be gone.
[00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.845]  That's what I certainly get out of that.
[00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.226]  OK, I've got to be calm.
[00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:51.127]  I've got to be a good boy.
[00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:52.888]  I've done massive research for this show.
[00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:54.884]  I don't know.
[00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:14.477]  All the latest developments on the collapsing border.
[00:04:14.477 --> 00:04:20.561]  Biden officially certifying human smuggling and just total criminal activity.
[00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.423]  The globalists admitting that the vaccine's being used for depopulation.
[00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:27.405]  Just the biggest developments yet on that front.
[00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:41.534]  The ADL, our master, our commander, our ruler, our slot police field marshal, our fuhrer, the head of the ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt, has said Tucker must go.
[00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:48.615]  He talked about the Great Reset's plan for replacement migration, which is an official U.N.
[00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:49.235]  plan.
[00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:56.079]  Democrats teach it in all their schools, but you aren't allowed to talk about it as an American because Mr. Greenblatt's in charge, okay?
[00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:56.839]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:03.214]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:06.936]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:14.100]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.044]  And citizenstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:24.806]  Again, this is high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:28.488]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:30.249]  They have massively expanded their factories.
[00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.610]  It's made right here in America and they're ready to ship it to you right now.

[00:05:50.554 --> 00:05:54.455]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.

[00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:16.433]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:19.295]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:30.247]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday, April 11th, 2021 broadcast.
[00:06:30.247 --> 00:06:34.508]  I'll be here for the next two hours, as I am every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:34.508 --> 00:06:35.329]  Central.
[00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:43.191]  Then the great Owens Troyer comes in with Sunday Live for two more hours with special guest news analysis and your calls.
[00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:46.552]  I intend to also open the phones up and take calls in the second hour tonight.
[00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:49.038]  And with the weekday transmission 11 a.m.
[00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:50.338]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:50.338 --> 00:06:59.866]  and other great info or shows at band.video like our great morning show, American Journal with Harrison Smith, live call-in show, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:00.987]  Central.
[00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:13.196]  And just remember with the whole backdrop of what we're about to cover, on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations, UHF, VHF, you name it, and Global Shortwave, WWCR, on TV satellites, radio satellites, you name it,
[00:07:15.282 --> 00:07:24.944]  The currency of the realm, the king daddy, the essence of victory is you.
[00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:41.248]  You could have a big wound on your foot and you're on a deserted island where you stepped on an old nail and you're getting gangrene, but if you're able to cauterize that out with a piece of burning bamboo and then get some penicillin, you're going to live and not lose the leg.
[00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:47.191]  But if you don't have penicillin, and the infection got too bad, you'd probably die.
[00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:50.333]  Well, InfoWars is like penicillin.
[00:07:50.333 --> 00:08:05.721]  So when you get shipwrecked, if you had that little medicine chest with some penicillin, you kept it in a cool, dry place, maybe in a cave, a few years later you're still deserted on the island, you got a bad infection, you take the penicillin, knocks out the bacteria, you live.
[00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.822]  Well, it's the same thing with the show.
[00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:10.403]  If you don't share it, you're the white blood cells,
[00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:20.592]  Or you're like the bloodstream, you know, carrying the antibiotics to the infection, then we don't have any hope.
[00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:29.975]  So, InfoWars is like a big bottle of penicillin on the shelf, but you've got to get it into the body, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:29.975 --> 00:08:32.496]  So, this is your mission.
[00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:40.014]  If you choose to accept it, is to tell everybody you know about the local stations you're listening to, or TV stations you're watching.
[00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:48.580]  But regardless, tell friends and family to tune in at the dreaded, demonized InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.561]  Sunday Live!
[00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:50.782]  Here's the incredible headlines.
[00:08:50.782 --> 00:08:54.445]  Let me tell you what's coming up and I'm going to drill through every single bit of it.
[00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:55.465]  Sunday Live!
[00:08:55.465 --> 00:09:00.789]  Biden threatens war with Russia while collapsing U.S.
[00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:01.710]  border.
[00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.891]  Meanwhile, the Caribbean
[00:09:03.852 --> 00:09:04.793]  Nation of St.
[00:09:04.793 --> 00:09:13.020]  Vincent is using a volcano to hold its citizens hostage for forced inoculations.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.362]  And so much more.
[00:09:15.362 --> 00:09:19.465]  So, coming up today, this is what we're going to cover.
[00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:30.454]  Secretary of State Blinken, who blinked big time with China, they've since basically invaded Hong Kong and Taiwan, warns of consequences if Russia acts aggressively in Ukraine
[00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:40.752]  Where we are moving troops in against the Russian-held areas of Eastern Ukraine that have been Russia since Russia was Russia.
[00:09:40.752 --> 00:09:46.955]  It's like if the Russians claimed Boston or New York, we'd say, ah, that's not a Russian city.
[00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:54.940]  But Eastern Ukraine is where Russia started, and it's where Russia's gotten a bunch of wars over it.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.981]  And all the really smart analysts agree
[00:09:59.455 --> 00:10:02.097]  Including the former heads of major intelligence agencies.
[00:10:02.097 --> 00:10:04.159]  I've not talked to just one, but two in the last few weeks.
[00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.263]  They agree that there's a good chance this is going to start a large war.
[00:10:08.263 --> 00:10:16.250]  But that's okay, because the puppet Vice President Kamala Harris said on Twitter, where she's still got free speech, the President doesn't.
[00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.411]  Real President.
[00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:23.276]  Brighter days are ahead with a picture of her looking out Air Force Two's window.
[00:10:23.276 --> 00:10:26.319]  Very creepy indeed.
[00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:34.169]  And then we're going to get into exclusives we have.
[00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:43.274]  Watch human smuggler with baby and cartel cats confronted by reporters at the border.
[00:10:43.274 --> 00:10:48.017]  And then the mainstream media writing, not dozens, but hundreds of news articles.
[00:10:48.017 --> 00:10:57.623]  When I say hundreds, basically hundreds of NBC channels and ABC news channels around the country ran newscasts from LA
[00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:03.591]  To Phoenix, to San Antonio, anywhere near the border.
[00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:07.213]  I mean, not like San Antonio is close, but closer.
[00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:14.637]  Saying, Alex Jones is a liar and hoaxed video of saving children from a smuggler.
[00:11:14.637 --> 00:11:17.079]  Wow.
[00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:22.602]  Well, since then, hundreds of people have gone down there peacefully to McAllen to show where I was at.
[00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:24.883]  And you can be there 30 minutes, you'll catch the exact same thing.
[00:11:27.614 --> 00:11:29.615]  And they're like, well, Biden says it's legal.
[00:11:29.615 --> 00:11:35.299]  Well, Biden could say we could sell heroin to two-year-olds or give, you know, hand grenades to chimpanzees.
[00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:36.260]  Doesn't mean it's the law.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.003]  I mean, Biden could say that, you know, he's God.
[00:11:40.003 --> 00:11:41.264]  He isn't.
[00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:44.066]  There's no, not even executive order.
[00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:49.509]  And I'm going to show you the Associated Press in three articles admitting it's illegal in a moment.
[00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.451]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:11:52.451 --> 00:11:54.453]  But it just shows how they lie to you.
[00:11:56.033 --> 00:11:58.075]  Oh, and that goes to the next point.
[00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:01.818]  It's why they don't want anybody to have their own radio show, their own TV show.
[00:12:01.818 --> 00:12:08.103]  They're confident that in the future they're going to shut down terrestrial radio and TV just by it becoming obsolete, but it won't become obsolete.
[00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:08.984]  It's like AM didn't.
[00:12:08.984 --> 00:12:11.546]  That's the only place you get the truth.
[00:12:11.546 --> 00:12:18.112]  AM was all going off in the early 80s until Rush Limbaugh came and then it made AM incredibly valuable again.
[00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:23.637]  So, they don't know what to do because, you know, the truth is still getting out.
[00:12:25.026 --> 00:12:27.668]  And so now they censor on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:31.772]  Congressional hearings with scientists saying COVID-19 is way overblown.
[00:12:31.772 --> 00:12:37.017]  And now Governor DeSantis has a roundtable with a prestigious scientist saying the same thing.
[00:12:37.017 --> 00:12:40.159]  So that gets banned because, well, the U.N.
[00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.101]  is the medical authority.
[00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:43.042]  And who runs the U.N.?
[00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:48.507]  Big Pharma, which Google and Facebook and Twitter have merged with.
[00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:49.648]  They don't want you to know that truth.
[00:12:49.648 --> 00:12:51.930]  That brings us to our next big enchilada.
[00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.927]  And I'll be covering that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:55.927 --> 00:12:57.068]  Tucker must go!
[00:12:57.068 --> 00:13:03.553]  ADL CEO calls on cable companies to drop Fox News.
[00:13:03.553 --> 00:13:13.080]  He already threatened Mark Zuckerberg into letting him run a board that they put on last year that oversees speech on Facebook.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.461]  That's three billion people.
[00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:19.124]  Mr. Rosenblatt's the head of the board that decides what can be said and what can't be.
[00:13:19.124 --> 00:13:21.486]  He's our political commissar, our boss.
[00:13:22.432 --> 00:13:27.676]  Our censor, closest thing in my lifetime to a Nazi ruling over me, I've run into.
[00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:39.825]  Oh, he was safe from those Nazis, like George Soros and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who they've given awards to, because they both praised Hitler and won work for Hitler.
[00:13:39.825 --> 00:13:42.767]  Oh, yeah, Schwarzenegger in Rolling Stone and other places said he loved Hitler.
[00:13:42.767 --> 00:13:48.992]  But see, if you love Hitler, Mr. Rosenblatt loves you, because he loves power.
[00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:51.344]  And control.
[00:13:51.344 --> 00:13:52.605]  He's the high priest.
[00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:55.889]  You've got to go to him for absolution.
[00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:58.491]  And so Tucker talked about replacement migration.
[00:13:58.491 --> 00:13:59.452]  It's an official U.N.
[00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:02.675]  plan that the Democrat Party and all these universities push.
[00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.596]  You hear it everywhere.
[00:14:03.596 --> 00:14:08.541]  Soon you old evil white people will all be dead and we're going to bring in all these minorities and have them on welfare.
[00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:12.545]  So they'll be the majority, which they are now, and they'll vote for Venezuela.
[00:14:15.347 --> 00:14:21.572]  And of course the big banks will then finance that and sit offshore and watch us go from a richest nation in the world to the most enslaved nation in the world.
[00:14:21.572 --> 00:14:24.754]  4% of the world's population had half the wealth in the 50s.
[00:14:24.754 --> 00:14:25.775]  Half that wealth is already gone.
[00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:28.697]  We're down about 30%.
[00:14:28.697 --> 00:14:32.340]  And so we're going to show you at the UN website.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:39.485]  So I guess Mr. Rosenblatt should call for the UN to be shut down because they call for replacement migration and it doesn't exist.
[00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:40.546]  Oh, but it gets better.
[00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.027]  I have the ADL calling for
[00:14:43.141 --> 00:14:55.165]  Stopping replacement migration and banning any non-Jews from Israel living there and not having a one-state solution, I'll show you from ADL.org.
[00:14:55.165 --> 00:15:01.567]  Oh, but see, it's okay if they have race-mixing laws in Israel.
[00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:04.908]  And it's okay if they're against replacement migration in Israel.
[00:15:05.743 --> 00:15:14.486]  But if you talk about it here, which is being done by design, and the left's teaching that whites are bad and evil, you see it all over the news, it means everywhere.
[00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:23.549]  Every five seconds, Target sells a book they published with prayers about destroying white people because we're inherently bad.
[00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:26.370]  Mr. Rosenblatt doesn't say a word about it.
[00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.771]  In fact, he endorses it.
[00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:31.251]  Wow.
[00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:34.052]  So, racial politics is powerful.
[00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:37.598]  And that's what Mr. Rosenblatt's doing.
[00:15:37.598 --> 00:15:42.542]  So be honest with you, the closest thing I see to a Nazi in America is Mr. Rosenblatt.
[00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:50.409]  And it's Sacha Baron Cohen that says arrest people, arrest Mark Zuckerberg if he allows any other ideas on Facebook.
[00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:51.890]  That's called fascism.
[00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.271]  That's called dangerous.
[00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:55.613]  That's called un-American.
[00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:59.776]  But hey, they've already basically taken over the whole internet.
[00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:02.158]  It's hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:19.068]  And our border's collapsing, and world government's being announced, and Joe Biden's coming after our guns, and trying to start a war with Russia, but told China they can take over Hong Kong and Taiwan, so China's done a blockade around Taiwan and is threatening to invade Hong Kong.
[00:16:19.068 --> 00:16:21.049]  They already sent troops into Hong Kong.
[00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:26.552]  This is madness, and our government's been hijacked now by these globalists, and they're trying to shut us down.
[00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:30.358]  They took our sponsors away a long time ago.
[00:16:30.358 --> 00:16:33.099]  But you sponsor us by buying products direct.
[00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:35.019]  So these are already great products you need.
[00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:38.821]  Whether it's Vitamin Refusion back in stock, or whether it's Winter Sun, or whether it's Lung Cleanse.
[00:16:38.821 --> 00:16:43.062]  They're all 40% off individually, 50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:46.346]  But regardless, it funds the Infowar, which is a 360Win.
[00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:50.510]  So, at this critical time in history, with all this craziness happening, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:56.154]  I want to remind you, these are products you and your family already need, and they fund the Infowar, a true 360Win.
[00:16:56.154 --> 00:16:57.936]  So take advantage of these products today.
[00:16:57.936 --> 00:17:00.017]  Find them at InfowarStore.com.
[00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:01.639]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:18.949]  InfoWars has been banned.
[00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:19.789]  Arrested.
[00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:25.651]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:27.111]  Because we are effective.
[00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:30.792]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:33.093]  Go to Banned.Video.
[00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:37.194]  Download the videos and share.
[00:17:37.194 --> 00:17:40.455]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:17:44.503 --> 00:17:46.684]  And never give up the fight.
[00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:47.584]  InfoWars.com.
[00:17:47.584 --> 00:17:57.286]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:17:57.286 --> 00:18:02.747]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:18:02.747 --> 00:18:05.008]  Thanks for holding
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.352]  I love your products.
[00:18:11.352 --> 00:18:22.082]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:18:22.082 --> 00:18:28.068]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:18:28.068 --> 00:18:29.129]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:39.078]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:47.845]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:18:47.845 --> 00:18:48.666]  This is working.
[00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.647]  This is wonderful.
[00:18:49.647 --> 00:18:54.191]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[00:18:54.191 --> 00:18:58.835]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:19:00.586 --> 00:19:02.967]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:04.708]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:07.690]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.951]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:09.871]  But I don't care about that.
[00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.912]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[00:19:11.912 --> 00:19:16.615]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:19.976]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:19:19.976 --> 00:19:21.497]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:19:21.497 --> 00:19:22.698]  But let's just say this.
[00:19:22.698 --> 00:19:23.999]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:26.460]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.741]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:33.302]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:36.483]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:19:36.483 --> 00:19:37.343]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.464]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:19:38.464 --> 00:19:44.906]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:46.626]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:19:46.626 --> 00:19:49.467]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[00:19:50.047 --> 00:19:53.169]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:19:53.169 --> 00:20:03.217]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:20:03.217 --> 00:20:05.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:33.127]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this live Sunday, April 11th transmission.
[00:20:33.127 --> 00:20:34.508]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:38.029]  So let's dive right into it.
[00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:48.913]  George Truly and Tucker Carlson, along with Vice President Pence, for the last four days have been dueling as the top three things on Twitter.
[00:20:49.597 --> 00:21:03.802]  And that drives the left just in total insane frothing mode, because Tucker's shadow man on there, I'm totally man on there, and you know, Mike Pence is the former vice president.
[00:21:03.802 --> 00:21:09.484]  And when they see the millions and millions of views of us running into
[00:21:10.646 --> 00:21:22.728]  Children that had not been screened properly by the Border Patrol turned loose to a so-called Catholic Charities, where it's a bunch of people with devil tattoos, you name it, loading children into the trunk of a car.
[00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:26.069]  We made the point they were transporting them illegally.
[00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:33.130]  And all of what's going on is smugly, according to federal law, when they're not given the paperwork, when they're not going to a hearing.
[00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.710]  I mean, a judge has to bare minimum release them.
[00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.871]  So federal law is being violated.
[00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:39.991]  No executive order has been signed.
[00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:47.475]  But I thought I would show TV viewers, and radio listeners can search any of this for yourself, some of the mainstream news on this just the last few days.
[00:21:47.475 --> 00:21:48.958]  Here's the Associated Press.
[00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:52.844]  Migrants free without court notice.
[00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:54.206]  Sometimes no paperwork.
[00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:56.021]  Well, it's not sometimes.
[00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.142]  It's almost all the time.
[00:21:57.142 --> 00:21:58.462]  We've interviewed the whistleblowers.
[00:21:58.462 --> 00:22:00.643]  We've interviewed the local police and the Border Patrol.
[00:22:00.643 --> 00:22:02.024]  The Border Patrol's been on record.
[00:22:02.024 --> 00:22:05.865]  The hell, the head of the Border Patrol came out and said, it's a humanitarian disaster.
[00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:08.387]  We've got 15,000 a day just of kids alone.
[00:22:08.387 --> 00:22:13.869]  They're asking NASA employees to take them, college professors to take them.
[00:22:13.869 --> 00:22:19.291]  The FBI said two weeks ago, we're waiving the law that you need a background check before you keep children.
[00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:21.772]  Because they said, rush the border.
[00:22:21.772 --> 00:22:23.373]  Biden said, rush the border.
[00:22:23.373 --> 00:22:24.953]  He said, you have courage if you do it.
[00:22:24.953 --> 00:22:26.874]  It causes the biggest rush ever.
[00:22:26.874 --> 00:22:29.756]  And then when it breaks down, they go, oh, well, there goes the law.
[00:22:29.756 --> 00:22:31.256]  Oopsie.
[00:22:31.256 --> 00:22:33.177]  Just let them go wherever they want.
[00:22:33.177 --> 00:22:38.200]  And here's this woman wearing a mask with the Grim Reaper tattoo on each leg and each arm.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.221]  And it's the exact Grim Reaper tattoo of MS-13.
[00:22:43.227 --> 00:22:48.111]  And so, we went and got all this footage, and what is the response of the Internet the first day on Wednesday?
[00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:49.051]  Oh, it's fake!
[00:22:49.051 --> 00:22:51.613]  He hired fake police!
[00:22:51.613 --> 00:22:55.496]  They had tweets with like 20,000 retweets going, What the hell?
[00:22:55.496 --> 00:22:56.917]  Jones hired fake police!
[00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.198]  This whole thing's fake!
[00:22:58.198 --> 00:22:58.979]  Oh, yeah!
[00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:01.821]  It's real fake!
[00:23:01.821 --> 00:23:05.483]  I don't have a budget to even shoot professional commercials, much less fake stuff.
[00:23:05.483 --> 00:23:08.285]  That's why all our ads are me standing there going, Here's the product, folks!
[00:23:11.204 --> 00:23:15.886]  I mean, if I could shoot stuff like this with a $100 million budget, I'd win Oscars every year, okay?
[00:23:15.886 --> 00:23:24.251]  Then the Catholic charity goes, no, Jones did it, but, you know, this was just a guy helping migrants, uh-huh, cramming them in the back of a car.
[00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:24.711]  Illegally.
[00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:27.472]  That's why the police took the kids away.
[00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:28.653]  They took them back to the charity.
[00:23:28.653 --> 00:23:35.657]  And then I had to go back to Austin, and our guys were there another day, and they have a whole bunch of footage of the same thing happening.
[00:23:35.657 --> 00:23:36.097]  And worse!
[00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:41.058]  And don't worry, we're going back down there, we're going back down to Brownsville, we're going everywhere now.
[00:23:41.058 --> 00:23:51.406]  I'm going to be down at the border all the time now, because you're saying it doesn't exist, but... Hell, they say Anthony doesn't exist, or BLM never set a fire, just say the border doesn't even exist.
[00:23:51.406 --> 00:23:52.787]  They'll probably say that next.
[00:23:52.787 --> 00:23:53.827]  So, let's continue.
[00:23:53.827 --> 00:23:56.509]  Migrants free without court notice, sometimes no paperwork.
[00:23:56.509 --> 00:23:56.910]  Oh, really?
[00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.331]  Totally illegally.
[00:23:58.331 --> 00:23:58.871]  Here's another one.
[00:23:58.871 --> 00:23:59.332]  AP.
[00:23:59.332 --> 00:23:59.652]  U.S.
[00:23:59.652 --> 00:24:05.116]  waives FBI checks on caregivers at new migrant facilities, including those with dirt floors under bridges.
[00:24:07.285 --> 00:24:14.970]  All this we told you years ago, months ago, now it's all confirmed by your God, talking to mainstream media, the AP.
[00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.470]  Here's another one.
[00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:21.014]  Border Patrol agents found 63 people inside a commercial trailer during a failed human smuggling attempt in Laredo.
[00:24:21.014 --> 00:24:22.315]  Well, it's not smuggling.
[00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:23.736]  I mean, they don't need any paperwork.
[00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:31.141]  I mean, you heard, cram them in the back of a van, cram them in the back of a hatchback, put them in a trunk, put them in an 18-wheeler.
[00:24:31.141 --> 00:24:31.361]  I mean,
[00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.611]  Oh, but when the cops stop them, oh, it's human smuggling.
[00:24:35.611 --> 00:24:39.452]  When we stop them illegally, we're bad people.
[00:24:39.452 --> 00:24:40.133]  That's right.
[00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:43.554]  We're bad people.
[00:24:43.554 --> 00:24:48.455]  Abbott claims child sex abuse and neglect of migrant children at San Antonio migrant facility.
[00:24:48.455 --> 00:24:48.875]  No.
[00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:50.296]  They've had the jail guards go public.
[00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:51.156]  Everybody's gone public.
[00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:51.916]  It's massive.
[00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:53.397]  It's out of control.
[00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.997]  And the media makes jokes about that.
[00:24:54.997 --> 00:24:56.478]  All the whistleblowers just came out.
[00:24:56.478 --> 00:24:57.658]  Those are on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:57.658 --> 00:24:59.959]  And we've got this.
[00:25:01.152 --> 00:25:06.637]  Catholic Charities Responds to Radio Host Alex Jones' McAllen Child Immigrant Encounter Video.
[00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:09.740]  Valley Central.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.825]  Wonder why Biden's czar, after only two months on the job, abruptly quit.
[00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:18.248]  After citing no crisis.
[00:25:18.248 --> 00:25:21.611]  House passes legislation to legalize millions of undocumented migrants.
[00:25:21.611 --> 00:25:22.092]  Fox News.
[00:25:23.129 --> 00:25:29.815]  New York to give illegals who lost work during pandemic one-time payments of $15,600, citizens to get nothing.
[00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:35.541]  It's all a magnet to bring them here so Democrats can put them in their houses, sign them up, and get the money.
[00:25:35.541 --> 00:25:37.082]  That's for Democrat operatives.
[00:25:37.082 --> 00:25:37.903]  That's come out in court.
[00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:43.907]  South Texas finding bodies of illegals on their land every day!
[00:25:43.907 --> 00:25:46.408]  NewsWars.com with links to local news.
[00:25:46.408 --> 00:25:48.849]  Raped and killed men and women.
[00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:50.990]  And it's not white supremacists doing it, folks.
[00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.830]  It's the cartels.
[00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.970]  But they're brown!
[00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:53.831]  They can't do wrong!
[00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:55.972]  The U.S.
[00:25:55.972 --> 00:26:01.834]  spends $6 million per day to house unaccompanied migrant children, says the federal government.
[00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:07.225]  Why do you think Putin ten years ago barred adoptions of Russian children by Americans?
[00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:22.519]  They said that they found a large percentage disappeared to other countries other than the U.S., many of them ended up dead, and the Russians alleged sex abuse, and that pedophiles were raping even small babies, and that some babies later ended up in snuff films.
[00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.600]  CBS News, remember that?
[00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.755]  Can't get the Russian meat anymore, but they're getting the Central American.
[00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:35.042]  That's mainly who the UN organizes and brings up.
[00:26:35.042 --> 00:26:37.626]  So that's what we've got going on here.
[00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:38.828]  And the media tried to spin it.
[00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:41.091]  Look at this article out of Talking Points Memo.
[00:26:41.957 --> 00:26:43.458]  Charity helping migrants.
[00:26:43.458 --> 00:26:47.700]  Oh, just helping migrants that have been waived in and not even checked.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.321]  And a lot of times, no DNA testing ever, not even with their parents.
[00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:53.923]  Alex Jones uses staged confrontation.
[00:26:53.923 --> 00:26:54.243]  Oh, really?
[00:26:54.243 --> 00:26:54.943]  What was staged?
[00:26:54.943 --> 00:26:56.684]  The people weren't real?
[00:26:56.684 --> 00:26:58.645]  No, they go on to admit it was real.
[00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:01.686]  They just call it staged.
[00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:03.947]  Uh-huh.
[00:27:03.947 --> 00:27:07.269]  Dude, Alex Jones really saved kids and that was his viral video where he stops car.
[00:27:08.852 --> 00:27:09.793]  Catholic Charities?
[00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:10.734]  Oh, the Blaze.
[00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:13.476]  You know, the guy that brings teddy bears down to the smuggled kids?
[00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:15.177]  Glenn Beck, man, he just won't stop.
[00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:21.863]  Catholic Charities accuses Alex Jones of staging confrontation over reported child migrants.
[00:27:21.863 --> 00:27:23.064]  Trump ended it for four years.
[00:27:23.064 --> 00:27:25.426]  Guess that upset old Glenn Beckie boy.
[00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:26.607]  He was like, let them all in.
[00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:27.247]  Bring the kids in.
[00:27:27.247 --> 00:27:28.588]  Remember that?
[00:27:28.588 --> 00:27:30.250]  What a creepazoid.
[00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.832]  And he posted that on the Blaze and attacked me and said I'm a fake.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.502]  No, buddy, we all know who the actor is and the guy that rehearses for hours before he goes on air, frees off a teleprompter.
[00:27:39.502 --> 00:27:40.743]  We know who the fake is.
[00:27:40.743 --> 00:27:42.484]  And I just wish Glenn Beck would stop.
[00:27:42.484 --> 00:27:44.224]  I've tried to get him to stop.
[00:27:44.224 --> 00:27:50.507]  He destroyed himself with his attack on Trump early on, and now he's turning to Colonel Sanders.
[00:27:50.507 --> 00:27:51.668]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:51.668 --> 00:28:02.092]  I'm not going to go, oh, look, Sister Norma Pimentel, named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential Women, she runs the Catholic Charities down there with all the kids pouring in.
[00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:05.373]  And she's a big globalist, of course.
[00:28:05.373 --> 00:28:07.113]  And she's so sweet.
[00:28:07.113 --> 00:28:10.474]  And she's just so nice.
[00:28:10.474 --> 00:28:12.194]  So, now they're just waving everybody in.
[00:28:12.194 --> 00:28:13.854]  First they said, don't call them illegal aliens.
[00:28:13.854 --> 00:28:15.495]  Call them migrants.
[00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:18.896]  And now it's, oh, don't even call them illegal being smuggled.
[00:28:18.896 --> 00:28:20.496]  Just don't even look.
[00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:21.476]  It's all legal now.
[00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:22.396]  There's no law.
[00:28:22.396 --> 00:28:25.517]  It's still illegal, but we just call it legal.
[00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:29.398]  And we'll have Glenn Beck come out and say, that's the case.
[00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:31.147]  So there you go.
[00:28:31.147 --> 00:28:33.308]  And they just play these sleight-of-hand games.
[00:28:33.308 --> 00:28:35.890]  All right, let me come back.
[00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:40.912]  Lil Nas X, who does a lot of children's shows, but did the deal where he has sex with the devil?
[00:28:40.912 --> 00:28:45.094]  Well, he put out a children's video of the little animals having sex for kids.
[00:28:45.094 --> 00:28:47.075]  He promoted it.
[00:28:47.075 --> 00:28:49.416]  He pushed a pedo video.
[00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:50.477]  That's right.
[00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:53.038]  Now the little kids have sex together on video.
[00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:54.319]  But it's okay because it's cartoons.
[00:28:54.319 --> 00:28:55.959]  That makes it legal.
[00:28:55.959 --> 00:28:57.580]  They just show cartoons having sex.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.161]  That's right.
[00:28:58.161 --> 00:28:58.921]  Open pedophiles.
[00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:02.423]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[00:29:03.937 --> 00:29:05.038]  And I just want to say something.
[00:29:05.038 --> 00:29:09.842]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[00:29:09.842 --> 00:29:14.766]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[00:29:14.766 --> 00:29:17.669]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:21.011]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:21.011 --> 00:29:22.252]  You've got red blood.
[00:29:22.252 --> 00:29:32.001]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:36.545]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working on it in the future.
[00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:39.447]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[00:29:39.447 --> 00:29:45.072]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[00:29:45.072 --> 00:29:46.974]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:51.377]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[00:29:51.377 --> 00:29:55.481]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:58.443]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[00:29:58.443 --> 00:29:58.824]  God bless.
[00:30:00.223 --> 00:30:01.286]  It's very simple.
[00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:08.222]  Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking a high-quality multivitamin mineral every single day.
[00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:12.241]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed.
[00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:14.243]  In fact, in many cases are toxic.
[00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:40.659]  Forget to get your next order.
[00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:51.902]  Mix it up in a big pitcher, put it in your refrigerator for your wife, your husband, your children, your neighbors, and just know that while you're helping yourself and your own bodies, natural defenses of the immune system, you're funding the InfoWar.
[00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:55.223]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, 40% off.
[00:30:55.223 --> 00:30:59.784]  Oh, and Winter Sun's back in stock, 40% off as well, at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:30:59.784 --> 00:31:03.605]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars.
[00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:05.146]  We're good to go.
[00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:27.486]  Thank you.
[00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:48.027]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[00:31:48.027 --> 00:31:58.254]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[00:32:13.182 --> 00:32:16.545]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[00:32:16.545 --> 00:32:28.136]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:33.640]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.722]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[00:32:35.722 --> 00:32:40.046]  You fund us, you support InfoWars4.com, you get rape privacy at the same time.
[00:32:40.046 --> 00:32:49.134]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[00:32:49.694 --> 00:32:57.580]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can beat the shock groups in the information war.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:03.224]  Fund us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:03.224 --> 00:33:05.846]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.004]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:33.004 --> 00:33:34.825]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:43.793]  So if you went back to The Great Game, all the textbooks the British Empire wrote about,
[00:33:57.472 --> 00:34:11.697]  Dominating the subcontinent of India, they used a few thousand troops to dominate tens of millions of people because they would divide, using sociology and anthropology, different culture groups against each other.
[00:34:11.697 --> 00:34:18.180]  Even if they were Hindus, if they were Buddhists, if they were Muslim, they would play those different groups off against each other.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.240]  It's called divide and conquer.
[00:34:20.214 --> 00:34:37.682]  And it came out in the WikiLeaks, this is not our opinion, that Hillary's like, we're going to lose this election, the public's waking up to us, and she's got major psychology professor heads telling her, well, just accelerate the culture war, racial and religious and sexual division.
[00:34:37.682 --> 00:34:43.665]  And so when you see all this, this is just the big banks, the megacorporations, big tech that's running slave camps in China,
[00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:49.006]  You know, Uyghur death camps invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, doing horrible stuff all over the world.
[00:34:49.006 --> 00:34:52.752]  They're backing China, telling you, oh look, fight with each other whites and blacks.
[00:34:54.344 --> 00:35:15.673]  And then, I remember before they fired Lou Dobbs over at Fox for exposing election fraud, he would cover Reuters articles where George Soros was bragging that he was giving billions of taxpayer dollars he got from the State Department under Obama to the illegal aliens from the Middle East, from Africa, to go into Europe and into the United States with those big caravans.
[00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:25.212]  And the ADL would come out and say, this is anti-Semitic, George Soros is Jewish, and so Lou Dobbs needs to be fired.
[00:35:25.212 --> 00:35:28.353]  It had nothing to do with George Soros being Jewish.
[00:35:28.353 --> 00:35:30.494]  They made it about that.
[00:35:30.494 --> 00:35:31.975]  Yeah, there's Reuters.
[00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:37.137]  George Soros, MasterCard to partner to aid migrant refugees.
[00:35:37.137 --> 00:35:44.079]  So again, we're talking about like saying, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl 2020.
[00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:56.061]  That's a fact, but the ADL will come out and say, no, the sky is red, that's anti-Semitic.
[00:35:56.061 --> 00:35:58.564]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:35:58.564 --> 00:36:10.414]  Well, Abe Foxman used to run the ADL, which is just a leftist, globalist, anti-gun group that basically, a bunch of self-appointed people claim they speak for all Jews, and then people pay them money and they'll call their enemies anti-Semites.
[00:36:10.979 --> 00:36:15.884]  But they would call all sorts of people that hadn't done anything, they lost a bunch of lawsuits, almost went bankrupt.
[00:36:15.884 --> 00:36:24.133]  So they brought in this more smooth operator, he's an Obama minion, because it's really Obama that's in charge still, Jonathan Greenblatt.
[00:36:24.133 --> 00:36:32.342]  And Jonathan Greenblatt then started shaking down Facebook, you name it, having his surrogate, Sacha Baron Cohen, called for the arrest at their official headquarters of
[00:36:33.593 --> 00:36:35.555]  Mark Zuckerberg, if he didn't do more.
[00:36:35.555 --> 00:36:43.842]  So Zuckerberg put Rosenblatt over Facebook's Thought Control Board, which is actually a hate crime board, globally.
[00:36:43.842 --> 00:36:46.184]  And he decides what can be said, what can be done.
[00:36:46.184 --> 00:36:50.228]  I guess what country can be invaded, what can't be.
[00:36:50.228 --> 00:36:52.570]  What group can criticize one group, what group can't be.
[00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.892]  That's why you see Christian persecution accelerating.
[00:36:54.892 --> 00:36:56.414]  Never a word out of the ADL about that.
[00:36:58.985 --> 00:37:00.786]  It's really dangerous.
[00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:05.167]  And so now he's taking aim at Fox News.
[00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:13.370]  And what's split up, you know, Fox sold its entertainment off a few years ago, but kept News Corp and Fox News and Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.111]  So that was split into two.
[00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:24.694]  And so now he goes on the no rating show with the most ridiculous person on earth and tries to act all officious and powerful, Brian
[00:37:25.575 --> 00:37:27.256]  Looks like a child molester skelter.
[00:37:27.256 --> 00:37:28.496]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:37.461]  I'm saying if I was going to cast somebody for a movie where, you know, if the clown eats children, grabs them out of a sewer pipe, I mean, it looks like him.
[00:37:37.461 --> 00:37:38.521]  But that's not what matters.
[00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:40.162]  He molested our First Amendment.
[00:37:40.162 --> 00:37:42.343]  He goes around trying to purge everyone.
[00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:46.525]  And he's got another raper of the First Amendment on with him.
[00:37:46.525 --> 00:37:52.768]  And that is Lord King, master of us all, head of the board that controls our speech,
[00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:59.302]  Kaiser Greenblatt.
[00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:00.845]  King Greenblatt.
[00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:03.150]  And so they're on there attacking Tucker Carlson
[00:38:04.901 --> 00:38:27.928]  We're talking about replacement migration, which you can go to any university site or turn on the news and it's like, thank God, whites will almost be gone, whites are inherently evil, get rid of the white people, my God, we've got to exterminate the whites, we've got to genocide the whites, and that's the left and the Black Lives Matter funded by Soros, funded by the Democrats, creating racial division in America.
[00:38:27.928 --> 00:38:32.670]  And so then if you don't like being told you're bad because you're a white person, or because you're a Christian,
[00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:36.485]  Well, here comes Rosenblatt to call you a Nazi on top of it.
[00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:39.827]  But what gets even crazier is he says it doesn't exist.
[00:38:39.827 --> 00:38:42.208]  I can show you the Democrats bragging about it.
[00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:45.570]  I can show you Israel saying they don't want replacement migration.
[00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.930]  And they even use that term.
[00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.891]  I can show you all of this.
[00:38:48.891 --> 00:38:49.612]  But does it matter?
[00:38:49.612 --> 00:38:59.276]  Because you better do what the Democrats say or Lord Rosenblatt will have you taken off or have you fired from your job.
[00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:00.176]  So that's how it works.
[00:39:00.176 --> 00:39:01.077]  So let me show you
[00:39:01.886 --> 00:39:05.609]  Some of this, and I'm going to show you the ADL next segment.
[00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.871]  I'm going to get into it right now.
[00:39:06.871 --> 00:39:11.335]  The ADL saying there's no great reset either.
[00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:12.816]  That's anti-Semitic.
[00:39:12.816 --> 00:39:22.645]  If you say that Klaus Schwab wants to shut down the world economy, save the earth, and admits the lockdown is about carbon taxes, which I have all the quotes of him saying, Rosenblatt says you're also a Nazi.
[00:39:22.645 --> 00:39:23.686]  This is just very easy.
[00:39:23.686 --> 00:39:27.189]  It doesn't matter if Klaus Schwab and the whole EU project is actually Nazi.
[00:39:28.675 --> 00:39:30.756]  So the Nazis have learned this round.
[00:39:30.756 --> 00:39:34.397]  What you do is you start an organization, run it, or buy off an organization.
[00:39:34.397 --> 00:39:41.840]  I mean, if Hitler would have just hired a few Jews and put them up front for him and, you know, had them say how great he was, he probably would have won World War II.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.542]  So this is truly sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:45.542 --> 00:39:52.045]  So let's go ahead and play this clip of him on with Brian Stelter yesterday.
[00:39:52.045 --> 00:39:53.545]  So what do we want Fox to do?
[00:39:53.545 --> 00:39:57.667]  I mean, first and foremost, Tucker has got to go.
[00:39:58.547 --> 00:40:13.905]  Again, I think it is a risk not just to the corporation, it's a risk to our society to be promoting these anti-Semitic and racist myths that literally were used by people on January the 6th to try to not just interfere with the election,
[00:40:14.526 --> 00:40:16.528]  But to murder lawmakers?
[00:40:16.528 --> 00:40:19.531]  I mean, I think we've really crossed a new threshold.
[00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:27.879]  When a major news network, you know, dismisses this, or pretends like it isn't important, this has deadly significance.
[00:40:27.879 --> 00:40:30.122]  So number one, Tucker has got to go.
[00:40:30.122 --> 00:40:37.189]  And then I think secondly, Brian, Fox needs to look at their entire primetime lineup and finally ask themselves,
[00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:38.830]  Ken, does this work?
[00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.234]  Because at the end of the day, let's acknowledge Fox isn't alone in this.
[00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:45.335]  They have advertisers.
[00:40:45.335 --> 00:40:47.377]  They have affiliates, right?
[00:40:47.377 --> 00:40:49.679]  There are cable companies who carry their signal.
[00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:53.462]  If Fox won't act, it may be time for the advertisers to act.
[00:40:53.462 --> 00:40:57.665]  It may be time for, again, the affiliates and the cable companies to act.
[00:40:57.665 --> 00:41:02.810]  To finally, once and for all, say that America is simply put no place for hate.
[00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.531]  Why is it even a debate anymore, Brian?
[00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:09.194]  Tucker just says, I'm talking about voting rights, and then the Murdochs will say, we don't cancel people.
[00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:12.416]  They'll say, you're trying to engage in cancel culture.
[00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:13.617]  I can actually hear them in my ear.
[00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:14.477]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[00:41:14.477 --> 00:41:25.784]  He then goes on with the greatest bravado, hubris, I guess sluts will be the proper word, and says, oh no, this isn't censorship, this isn't cancel culture.
[00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:30.207]  Well, you want me to play you the Tucker Carlson clip that Mr. Greenblatt tweeted out?
[00:41:30.839 --> 00:41:34.461]  Because it's the most, quite frankly, boring for most of what Tucker Carlson covers.
[00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:40.003]  He's like, yeah, the Democrats are meant to bring in third world people, they control, it'll vote for them, you know, replacement migration.
[00:41:40.003 --> 00:41:41.464]  I mean, this is what they say.
[00:41:41.464 --> 00:41:42.804]  This is the party platform.
[00:41:42.804 --> 00:41:45.705]  They want illegals to be able to vote.
[00:41:45.705 --> 00:41:46.746]  So anybody can find this.
[00:41:46.746 --> 00:41:49.747]  They just go to Mr. Greenblatt's deal if you want to see what Tucker said.
[00:41:49.747 --> 00:41:51.848]  But it's extremely, extremely milquetoast.
[00:41:52.688 --> 00:41:55.069]  But, oh, that turns into Nazi.
[00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:59.411]  Really, I thought we were the country that beat the Nazis and saved Mr. Greenblatt's family.
[00:41:59.411 --> 00:42:02.873]  I thought both my grandfathers were in the Army Air Corps and both almost died.
[00:42:02.873 --> 00:42:08.796]  I thought I almost, I don't almost exist for helping save the Jews out of Europe, my ancestors.
[00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:10.777]  But that doesn't matter to Mr. Rosenblatt.
[00:42:10.777 --> 00:42:13.358]  He just waves a wand and I am now the bad man.
[00:42:13.358 --> 00:42:14.459]  He is now the good guy.
[00:42:14.459 --> 00:42:18.741]  So when we come back, we'll actually play for you The Devilish Evil.
[00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.102]  It's a short club that they want him banned for.
[00:42:21.102 --> 00:42:22.063]  And then I'm going to show you
[00:42:22.927 --> 00:42:31.350]  The ADL saying we cannot have a one-state solution and allow non-Jews to live in Israel because they will then out-breed and out-vote us.
[00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.991]  They even say the Arabs have too many children.
[00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:35.691]  Now listen, I don't mind Israel existing.
[00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.832]  I'm not against the Jews.
[00:42:36.832 --> 00:42:40.313]  I think as a group, people should be able to have their own homeland if they want it.
[00:42:40.313 --> 00:42:44.314]  It's just you can't then say that whites can't even exist here.
[00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:55.438]  And then the ADL is going to lead a Tower of Babel coalition on a jihad against the evil Christians, because, I mean, you've got some beef with Christians from 500 years ago.
[00:42:55.438 --> 00:42:56.058]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:56.058 --> 00:42:59.958]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:03.459]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[00:43:03.459 --> 00:43:10.520]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.581]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are the right team.
[00:43:15.495 --> 00:43:18.458]  You're about to find out how pathetic you are.
[00:43:18.458 --> 00:43:25.705]  So I ask all of you, who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:28.527]  The enemy is about to expose itself.
[00:43:28.527 --> 00:43:30.850]  The enemy can't help itself.
[00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.913]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:43:34.913 --> 00:43:39.398]  We sit here as good people and get upset about that and try to stop it, and we should, but
[00:43:40.427 --> 00:43:50.353]  Once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[00:43:50.353 --> 00:43:52.514]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[00:43:52.514 --> 00:43:56.116]  You're going under judgment, just like all the children that were aborted.
[00:43:56.116 --> 00:43:57.777]  This is the truth.
[00:43:57.777 --> 00:43:59.738]  This is the Infowar.
[00:43:59.738 --> 00:44:00.658]  I'm gonna say it again.
[00:44:00.658 --> 00:44:02.619]  I am not lecturing you.
[00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:03.580]  I'm lecturing myself.
[00:44:04.539 --> 00:44:07.903]  I need to take Vitamin Renal Infusion every day.
[00:44:07.903 --> 00:44:13.992]  It tastes great, it's all natural, it's got all the vitamins, all the minerals that are essential, and amino acids.
[00:44:13.992 --> 00:44:17.977]  Mix it up in the morning, little quarter scoop, fill the whole pitcher with a whole scoop.
[00:44:17.977 --> 00:44:19.880]  It lasts you four or five days in the refrigerator.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.142]  Pour yourself a big glass with ice.
[00:44:21.903 --> 00:44:23.044]  And it's so good!
[00:44:23.044 --> 00:44:28.310]  In the morning, at noon, at night, whatever you do, get in that one glass a day.
[00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:29.591]  It's been sold out for a while.
[00:44:29.591 --> 00:44:30.893]  It's back in stock.
[00:44:30.893 --> 00:44:32.475]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:46:00.083 --> 00:46:01.644]  Gerald of South Carolina.
[00:46:01.644 --> 00:46:02.425]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:46:02.425 --> 00:46:03.145]  Trying to move quicker.
[00:46:03.145 --> 00:46:03.986]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:03.986 --> 00:46:04.426]  Welcome.
[00:46:04.426 --> 00:46:09.589]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:12.971]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:19.415]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:21.076]  Living Defense saved my life.
[00:46:21.076 --> 00:46:25.239]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:26.680]  Living Defense brought me back.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.481]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[00:46:32.481 --> 00:46:34.902]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[00:46:34.902 --> 00:46:44.184]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[00:46:44.184 --> 00:46:49.626]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[00:46:49.626 --> 00:46:51.146]  That's right where we're at brother.
[00:46:51.346 --> 00:47:03.252]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[00:47:03.252 --> 00:47:05.854]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.897 --> 00:47:16.978]  I remember.
[00:47:16.978 --> 00:47:22.882]  I stopped being politically correct.
[00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:25.884]  I stopped caring what the system said.
[00:47:25.884 --> 00:47:32.488]  Because I knew I was a good person and I was telling the truth.
[00:47:32.488 --> 00:47:40.012]  All right, so you can say, well, who cares about the ADL or the Southern Bribery Law Center or Media Matters?
[00:47:40.012 --> 00:47:44.055]  Well, these groups have been put on these telecom boards
[00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:50.854]  To surveil you to get in your private accounts, to track your private messengers, they're in those too.
[00:47:50.854 --> 00:47:59.141]  ADL famously got in big trouble criminally for breaking into police stations and stealing files, intelligence files, on the general public.
[00:47:59.141 --> 00:48:02.744]  And so the ADL's got a lot of chutzpah.
[00:48:02.744 --> 00:48:05.546]  And they don't go after real Nazis, folks.
[00:48:05.546 --> 00:48:10.090]  They just sit there and try to parlay political power for the Democratic Party.
[00:48:11.628 --> 00:48:20.776]  And so now they're going after the populist Tucker Carlson, who really does genuinely care about everybody and wants our jobs back and wants to unify us, and who really tries to bring us together.
[00:48:20.776 --> 00:48:24.779]  A good, wholesome, loving person.
[00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:27.842]  I mean, I'm ten times meaner than he is.
[00:48:27.842 --> 00:48:36.529]  And I don't have a bad bone in my body for somebody that's a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian or an agnostic, as long as you're not trying to enslave me.
[00:48:36.529 --> 00:48:39.071]  But there are plenty of Muslims that want to conquer me and say I'm bad.
[00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:39.692]  Well, I'm against them.
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.622]  There's some crazy Christian groups that want to take over and I think they're cults.
[00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:53.726]  But I mean, the ADL... The ADL goes around bullying Americans and trying to control our speech.
[00:48:53.726 --> 00:48:59.789]  And I don't care if it was the Russians or the Nazis or the Easter Bunny doing it.
[00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:02.090]  I wholeheartedly oppose it.
[00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:09.214]  Now let's see the clip that Mr. Rosenblatt tweeted out that he's saying is Nazi and evil and bad and we've got to boycott.
[00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:16.402]  Tucker Carlson and we got to boycott Fox and boycott his stations and have them taken off the cable providers because of this.
[00:49:16.402 --> 00:49:18.262]  Because they've already gotten Trump banned everywhere.
[00:49:18.262 --> 00:49:20.283]  They've already gotten Alex Jones banned everywhere.
[00:49:20.283 --> 00:49:25.924]  They've already gotten thousands and thousands of prominent nationalistic conservatives and mainline individuals.
[00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:29.544]  I mean a lot of just really... Prager University is getting banned all over the place.
[00:49:29.544 --> 00:49:34.725]  Because it's good, decent info and oh it's got a Jew running it who's a great person.
[00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:37.746]  I don't look at what a person is, I look at what they produce.
[00:49:37.746 --> 00:49:38.966]  You know like Martin Luther King said,
[00:49:41.898 --> 00:49:47.719]  So, if you stand up for conservative, real values, pro-human values, you're attacked.
[00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:49.679]  This is in the way of the corporate takeover.
[00:49:49.679 --> 00:49:52.840]  You know, where is the ADL criticizing the Uyghur death camps?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.821]  And criticizing Apple that runs the biggest factories getting components made by slaves?
[00:49:57.821 --> 00:49:58.881]  They're not there!
[00:49:58.881 --> 00:50:02.282]  He's too busy telling you Tucker Carlson's a Nazi.
[00:50:02.282 --> 00:50:10.443]  He's too busy writing letters to the New York Times saying, I hate Jews and Alex Jones should be taken off the air when any idiot knows the anti-Semites don't like me.
[00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:14.890]  Because they're all part of the same global Survive and Conquer camp.
[00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:17.475]  But I will not sit there and watch people wrap themselves.
[00:50:18.189 --> 00:50:24.856]  In Judaism, and then say, I'm a bad person, and then bully me, and engage in something that's as close to Hitler as I've ever seen in my life.
[00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:41.413]  I mean, that's what Hitler did, was take speech, and take a bank account, and take people's rights, and silence them, and persecute them, and that's what he did, and now that's what you do, Mr. Rosenblatt, and you had Sacha Baron Cohen on saying, it's time to arrest the big tech heads, like Mark Zuckerberg, if he doesn't do what you say!
[00:50:41.633 --> 00:50:47.735]  And he got on his knees and he appointed Mr. Rosenblatt on that board under that threat of imprisonment.
[00:50:47.735 --> 00:50:50.776]  That's called terrorism!
[00:50:50.776 --> 00:50:52.336]  And that's what all this is.
[00:50:52.336 --> 00:50:55.457]  It's beyond bullying now.
[00:50:55.457 --> 00:51:00.559]  So here's what they said he needs to be taken off the air for.
[00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:03.280]  This was tweeted by the god Rosenblatt.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:03.560]  Here it is.
[00:51:04.213 --> 00:51:11.707]  I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term replacement.
[00:51:11.707 --> 00:51:15.574]  If you suggest the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current
[00:51:16.312 --> 00:51:22.037]  Electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the third world.
[00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:24.959]  But they become hysterical because that's what's happening, actually.
[00:51:24.959 --> 00:51:25.540]  Let's just say it.
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.622]  That's true.
[00:51:27.622 --> 00:51:43.355]  If this was happening in your house, if you were in sixth grade, for example, and without telling you, your parents adopted a bunch of new siblings and gave them brand new bikes and let them stay up later and help them with their homework and gave them twice the allowance that they gave you.
[00:51:44.216 --> 00:51:49.801]  You would say to your siblings, you know, I think we're being replaced by kids that our parents love more.
[00:51:49.801 --> 00:51:54.005]  And it would be kind of hard to argue against you because look at the evidence.
[00:51:54.005 --> 00:52:00.690]  So this matters on a bunch of different levels, but on the most basic level, it's a voting rights question.
[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.352]  Oh, and by the way, I don't have a teleprompter.
[00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:03.112]  I guess I'm wrong.
[00:52:03.112 --> 00:52:04.433]  It's Greenblatt.
[00:52:04.433 --> 00:52:06.595]  Jonathan Greenblatt.
[00:52:06.595 --> 00:52:07.676]  Jonestown Greenblatt.
[00:52:07.676 --> 00:52:08.797]  I know him very well.
[00:52:08.797 --> 00:52:09.978]  I just got the name wrong.
[00:52:11.849 --> 00:52:12.509]  There you go.
[00:52:12.509 --> 00:52:13.370]  You just heard that.
[00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.611]  By the way, I just showed you where New Yorkers get no money.
[00:52:16.611 --> 00:52:20.073]  They get the federal $1,400 check, but no state money.
[00:52:20.073 --> 00:52:23.034]  But illegal aliens get $15,000 plus.
[00:52:23.034 --> 00:52:31.698]  So that's 20, 30 nice bikes.
[00:52:31.698 --> 00:52:35.740]  20 or 30 decent bikes.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.980]  15 bikes.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.081]  10 bikes.
[00:52:38.081 --> 00:52:40.162]  The point is, I guess a fancy bike, only one bike.
[00:52:40.788 --> 00:52:44.551]  But that's what's going on here, is insanity!
[00:52:44.551 --> 00:52:53.599]  To draw everybody here, to then be controlled by the Democrats, to be put on welfare, to be milked by the Democrats, to control the system, and then this guy wants to take him off the air.
[00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:56.041]  So let me just show you what's going on here.
[00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:58.683]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:52:58.683 --> 00:53:01.525]  Anti-Defamation League calls for Tucker Carlson's firing.
[00:53:01.525 --> 00:53:09.072]  CNN explains over images of the KKK, which at the time of the Texas month, it'll tell you, is run by the feds.
[00:53:11.027 --> 00:53:12.427]  Now here's from UN.org.
[00:53:12.427 --> 00:53:14.608]  Can we zoom in even closer on this?
[00:53:14.608 --> 00:53:16.769]  UN.org.
[00:53:16.769 --> 00:53:18.209]  Replacement migration.
[00:53:18.209 --> 00:53:21.050]  Is it a solution to declining and aging populations?
[00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:27.912]  It called for 600 million people to replace the United States population by 2050.
[00:53:27.912 --> 00:53:32.833]  This is the official plan of the UN.
[00:53:32.833 --> 00:53:35.014]  UN.org.
[00:53:35.014 --> 00:53:37.215]  Same one set up by the Rockefellers.
[00:53:37.215 --> 00:53:38.475]  You know, the ones that set up Hitler.
[00:53:40.935 --> 00:53:43.631]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:53:49.016 --> 00:53:50.237]  There it is, from the U.N.
[00:53:50.237 --> 00:53:50.797]  website.
[00:53:50.797 --> 00:53:51.838]  But let's show you more.
[00:53:51.838 --> 00:53:54.459]  Here's Republicans' demographic gap.
[00:53:54.459 --> 00:54:04.285]  MSN, that all these foreigners coming in are going to vote Democrat, and the Democrats are going to do it, and Republicans should get more welfare, or they're going to be outvoted, all admitting the replacement demographic.
[00:54:04.285 --> 00:54:08.708]  Response to common inaccuracy, bi-national, one-state solution.
[00:54:08.708 --> 00:54:09.989]  ADL.org.
[00:54:09.989 --> 00:54:11.090]  Zoom in on this very closely.
[00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.692]  This is from the ADL website.
[00:54:14.692 --> 00:54:18.114]  Response to common inaccuracy, bi-national, one-state solution.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.523]  Translate.
[00:54:21.523 --> 00:54:27.491]  ADL expressly condemns any plans for replacement migration in Israel.
[00:54:27.491 --> 00:54:30.114]  And it goes right through it right here.
[00:54:30.114 --> 00:54:36.842]  Furthermore, bi-nationalism is unworkable given current realities and historic animosities, which the left stirs up here.
[00:54:37.426 --> 00:54:46.154]  With historically high birth rates among the Palestinians... Well, imagine... Imagine if Republicans were saying this about other people.
[00:54:46.154 --> 00:54:51.718]  Furthermore, bi-nationalism is unworkable given current realities and historic animosities.
[00:54:51.718 --> 00:55:02.568]  With historically high birth rates among the Palestinians and a possible influx of Palestinian refugees and their descendants now living around the world, Jews would quickly be a minority within the bi-nation state.
[00:55:03.251 --> 00:55:08.097]  Thus likely ending any semblance of equality, representation, or protections.
[00:55:08.097 --> 00:55:13.865]  It is a situation the Jewish population would be increasingly politically and potentially physically vulnerable.
[00:55:15.197 --> 00:55:20.699]  Oh, you mean the left brings in a bunch of people, teaches them liberation theology, teaches them Jews are bad and then kills you?
[00:55:20.699 --> 00:55:30.283]  Because I can turn on the news and see the Black Lives Matter founders, I can play clips, I will next hour, saying burn down every police department and kill all the whites, even the nice ones.
[00:55:30.283 --> 00:55:38.887]  Target sells a book with a Black Lives Matter headlady, it's on Infowars.com, saying, I pray to God to help me hate whites more, even the nice ones.
[00:55:38.887 --> 00:55:43.369]  They are a scourge and a disease and being white is bad, unless you're...
[00:55:46.664 --> 00:55:49.405]  Jonathan Green Black.
[00:55:49.405 --> 00:55:54.708]  He's okay, though he's got white skin.
[00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:57.829]  So, man, this is total race politics.
[00:55:57.829 --> 00:56:00.190]  This is the closest thing the Nazis have ever seen.
[00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.411]  And I won't be intimidated by the ADL in front of this.
[00:56:02.411 --> 00:56:03.491]  This is dangerous.
[00:56:03.491 --> 00:56:04.992]  This is evil.
[00:56:04.992 --> 00:56:05.932]  And this is divisive.
[00:56:05.932 --> 00:56:11.255]  And this is a plan to use race politics yet again to bring a country down and to do all of this.
[00:56:11.255 --> 00:56:14.296]  There is a prayer of a weary black woman.
[00:56:14.296 --> 00:56:16.077]  Please help me to hate white people.
[00:56:19.053 --> 00:56:29.420]  And this is what Target publishes, and oh my God, can you imagine if I published a book that said, help me hate black people, which I don't hate black people, I might fall into their trap.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:35.845]  But no, this is published by Target, nothing from Greenblatt.
[00:56:35.845 --> 00:56:45.512]  And it goes on, response to common inaccuracy by nation, one state solution goes into saying, we must be a race-based system, we can't let foreigners in, we can't be replaced.
[00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:49.631]  George Soros MasterCard to partner to aid migrants.
[00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:50.472]  Reuters.
[00:56:50.472 --> 00:56:52.032]  But Greenblatt also says that does not exist.
[00:56:52.032 --> 00:56:53.673]  You're a Nazi if you say it.
[00:56:53.673 --> 00:56:54.193]  It's official.
[00:56:54.193 --> 00:56:56.054]  Democrats want illegal aliens voting in US elections.
[00:56:56.054 --> 00:56:58.055]  We have the links to it right there.
[00:56:58.055 --> 00:57:00.717]  Census could reveal election extinction of the Republicans.
[00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:01.077]  They ill.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.141]  Because the Democrats are making it along racial lines.
[00:57:04.141 --> 00:57:16.009]  All of it, right there, putting us in checkmate, and they're just saying, hey, be nice, be good, don't be racist, do what we say, while they push a whole race-based system and a total anti-Christian takeover.
[00:57:16.009 --> 00:57:21.172]  It's disgusting, it's dangerous, and history's repeating yet again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:21.172 --> 00:57:26.656]  And I'm very worried about everybody on this planet, no matter what color you are, what your religion is, this is evil and this is wrong.
[00:57:26.656 --> 00:57:30.178]  I haven't even hit the great reset that Rosenblatt said doesn't exist.
[00:57:31.727 --> 00:57:33.048]  Whatever the hell his name is.
[00:57:33.048 --> 00:57:35.090]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:42.257]  I'm Alex Jones, Defender of the Republic, Defender of Man, Defender of Humanity, Defender of Justice.
[00:57:42.257 --> 00:57:46.020]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance!
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.403]  Now tell folks to tune in now!
[00:57:49.728 --> 00:57:54.051]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[00:57:54.051 --> 00:58:04.678]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[00:58:04.678 --> 00:58:10.862]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:58.068]  Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking a high-quality multivitamin mineral every single day.
[00:58:58.829 --> 00:59:04.671]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed, in fact, in many cases are toxic.

[00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:21.717]  I think so.
[00:59:52.742 --> 00:59:57.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:57.324 --> 01:00:13.852]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to get into the collapsing border, the U.S.
[01:00:13.852 --> 01:00:17.234]  government sending troops into eastern Ukraine trying to start a war with Russia.
[01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:20.035]  The Federal Reserve calling for world government to global income tax.
[01:00:20.035 --> 01:00:21.936]  It's all official.
[01:00:23.239 --> 01:00:25.941]  YouTube wants a global authority over speech.
[01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:30.043]  I forgot to tell you about that little scribble of news.
[01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:37.987]  And we've got this huge vaccine news and roll out of that and all the different deaths and side effects and the attempts to cover all that up.
[01:00:37.987 --> 01:00:41.209]  They're now saying black people not wanting to take the shot is racist.
[01:00:41.209 --> 01:00:43.070]  It's because of racist white people.
[01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.532]  Yeah, the ones they caught giving them syphilis and other diseases via vaccines.
[01:00:46.532 --> 01:00:47.272]  Exactly.
[01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:49.293]  No, no, they're saying it's because blacks can't get the shot.
[01:00:49.293 --> 01:00:51.174]  No, they don't want the shot.
[01:00:51.174 --> 01:00:52.215]  Just like I saw the numbers.
[01:00:53.474 --> 01:00:55.777]  40% of Marines say no to vaccine.
[01:00:55.777 --> 01:01:00.642]  That's in control groups that they already had authorized to take it, that they wanted to take it.
[01:01:00.642 --> 01:01:04.446]  It's more like 80% of the Marines aren't taking the shots.
[01:01:04.446 --> 01:01:07.409]  That's all coming up.
[01:01:07.409 --> 01:01:16.578]  But you know, Prince Philip, 99 years old, Transylvanian king, not even British, 70 plus years ago married Queen Elizabeth,
[01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:22.716]  And there's some of the last photos of him a month and a half ago when he got out of the hospital after heart surgery and stuff.
[01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:26.600]  And, you know, the media is trying to spin things.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.765]  They're like, well, because they had Meghan Merkle attack the royal family because they're white.
[01:01:30.765 --> 01:01:32.246]  People go, we're sick of canceled culture.
[01:01:32.246 --> 01:01:33.688]  Shut up, Merkel.
[01:01:33.688 --> 01:01:35.790]  But then now they're ignoring that Prince Philip said that
[01:01:37.336 --> 01:01:42.378]  Black people weren't human beings, and that he wanted to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world's population.
[01:01:42.378 --> 01:01:44.820]  So that's how that whole left-right paradigm operates.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:50.422]  So I haven't talked about him since he died four or five days ago, just because I've had other things to do.
[01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:54.804]  But, you know, why see him in death?
[01:01:54.804 --> 01:01:59.446]  We put on screen, they have released a colorized photo of him at birth just today.
[01:01:59.446 --> 01:02:01.767]  This is an exclusive.
[01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:03.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, look how cute that is.
[01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:04.869]  You can see he's male right there.
[01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:12.547]  That is Prince Philip, 99 years ago, and back then they had x-ray photos.
[01:02:12.547 --> 01:02:16.169]  The royalty wanted to check the babies, and so they colorized it.
[01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:18.170]  But, wow!
[01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:22.533]  That is Prince Philip at birth.
[01:02:22.533 --> 01:02:23.374]  That was taken second.
[01:02:23.374 --> 01:02:25.575]  You can see his little hands covering his eyes.
[01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.918]  It was so bright, so bright under those lights there in the maternity ward.
[01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:32.240]  I guess he was born in Greece.
[01:02:33.852 --> 01:02:35.052]  King of Greece.
[01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:37.933]  But there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:37.933 --> 01:02:39.954]  What a little sweetie pie.
[01:02:39.954 --> 01:02:41.734]  What a cutie cake.
[01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:43.015]  And don't be mean.
[01:02:43.015 --> 01:02:45.635]  I mean, if you notice any anomalies or anything, it's not a big deal.
[01:02:45.635 --> 01:03:01.000]  It's an actual photo of His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, consort to Queen Elizabeth II of Britannia, Saxe-Coburg, Gotham-on-Baton of the House of Dragon!
[01:03:02.708 --> 01:03:06.469]  How dare you say he's a vampiric-looking individual?
[01:03:06.469 --> 01:03:08.470]  Actual?
[01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.370]  There you go.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.670]  Exactly.
[01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:11.631]  Actual photos.
[01:03:11.631 --> 01:03:13.071]  We're having a little fun here.
[01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:14.772]  Let me actually tell you what this is.
[01:03:14.772 --> 01:03:16.112]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:03:16.112 --> 01:03:20.133]  This is what a baby bat in the womb looks like.
[01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:21.894]  And the left is all cooing over how cute it is.
[01:03:21.894 --> 01:03:24.515]  If it was a human baby, they'd want to kill it.
[01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:25.455]  So there's the whole joke.
[01:03:25.455 --> 01:03:28.856]  There's the direct line of Count Dracula, who wasn't really a vampire, though he did
[01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:32.703]  His descendants actually bathed in blood and drank blood.
[01:03:32.703 --> 01:03:34.285]  I think one of his granddaughters did, famously.
[01:03:34.285 --> 01:03:38.028]  But he would put people on poles.
[01:03:38.028 --> 01:03:39.349]  It was Vlad the Impaler.
[01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:41.892]  So I decided to make the little joke out of that.
[01:03:41.892 --> 01:03:43.213]  So that's called satire.
[01:03:43.213 --> 01:03:53.422]  Snopes will probably edit the video or the Southern Primary Law Center or something and say, oh, yeah, there's Prince Philip with the Nazis.
[01:03:53.422 --> 01:03:55.184]  But that's OK, because Tim Cook's gay.
[01:03:56.050 --> 01:04:03.097]  And of course his son, Prince Charles, hangs out with Jimmy Savella, the highest level security clearance, who ran sex dungeons with kidnapped children.
[01:04:03.097 --> 01:04:05.659]  They'd lay out plastic and then slit their throats.
[01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:07.100]  I mean, not Prince Charles.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.382]  He never got implicated in that.
[01:04:08.382 --> 01:04:10.604]  Just his private sex butler.
[01:04:11.624 --> 01:04:12.585]  So, there it is.
[01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:14.686]  But hey, he's royalty, so let's not talk about it.
[01:04:14.686 --> 01:04:21.209]  And again, they had that whole Meghan Merkle thing, and Prince Harry is not from the royal line.
[01:04:21.209 --> 01:04:24.411]  Princess Diana had sex with the head of the guards, that's well known.
[01:04:24.411 --> 01:04:25.111]  And then that's it.
[01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:28.192]  And so they put them in the whole time of this political correct deal.
[01:04:28.192 --> 01:04:30.474]  Everybody's sick up to make the girls look good.
[01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:31.154]  That's all that is.
[01:04:31.574 --> 01:04:37.656]  We're getting down to real racism, real elitism, real globalism, real blood of children being transfused into them.
[01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:38.516]  That's all confirmed.
[01:04:38.516 --> 01:04:40.957]  I'll tell you that 20 years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[01:04:40.957 --> 01:04:43.097]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:46.558]  So, did you know?
[01:04:46.558 --> 01:04:52.920]  Oh my gosh, photos of the newborn Prince Philip released 99 years ago today.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.481]  Wow, isn't that sweet?
[01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:55.081]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:02.172]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[01:05:02.172 --> 01:05:12.118]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[01:05:12.118 --> 01:05:15.459]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[01:05:15.459 --> 01:05:27.026]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[01:05:27.867 --> 01:05:32.531]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:34.614]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[01:05:34.614 --> 01:05:38.918]  You fund us, you support InfoWars4.com, you get great products, you get the same time.
[01:05:38.918 --> 01:05:48.608]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[01:05:48.608 --> 01:05:50.030]  That's our job, so please,
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:56.432]  Keep us on air, so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can be the shock troops in the information war.
[01:05:56.432 --> 01:06:10.418]  Fund us at infowarestore.com.
[01:06:10.418 --> 01:06:12.299]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:18.981]  When I grow up, I want to be free of the New World Order!
[01:06:18.981 --> 01:06:19.162]  Woo-hoo!
[01:06:19.162 --> 01:06:20.082]  We now take you live.
[01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:28.675]  To the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:28.675 --> 01:06:35.078]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.198]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:47.822 --> 01:06:51.243]  The New Atlantis is our republic.
[01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:56.985]  And it might have gotten taken over by groups and organizations that wanted to scuttle that.
[01:06:56.985 --> 01:06:59.486]  But America is the escape pod.
[01:06:59.486 --> 01:07:04.028]  And that's why you see such a fight to bring our beautiful republic and our great idea down.
[01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:06.849]  But the New World Order will fail in the end.
[01:07:06.849 --> 01:07:09.550]  Because their globalism is the false globalism.
[01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:13.171]  It will be a real globalism of humanity united under God.
[01:07:13.171 --> 01:07:15.432]  And that is coming on the other side of this fight.
[01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:21.181]  We're coming to your town because we're an American band.
[01:07:21.181 --> 01:07:24.484]  All right, Alex Jones here, your host.
[01:07:24.484 --> 01:07:32.152]  I want to give the number out in this segment to start taking calls next segment on anything I've covered.
[01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:34.495]  All I ask today is it be first time callers.
[01:07:35.393 --> 01:07:42.298]  You want to get into the open borders, the FBI saying, hey, we just let smugglers bring kids in, give them to people with no records.
[01:07:42.298 --> 01:07:44.219]  We exclusively aired yesterday.
[01:07:44.219 --> 01:07:46.160]  In fact, I've got my yesterday clip.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.943]  I might play this here on the big show because we're on hundreds of stations right now.
[01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:55.807]  Witnesses told us inside a man was saying, I want that woman, I want that woman, I want this woman.
[01:07:55.807 --> 01:08:01.690]  We had a law enforcement lady undercover in there, local law enforcement.
[01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.371]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.841]  And we've been sent there by the Border Patrol sources.
[01:08:06.841 --> 01:08:09.402]  And we met with the highest levels of law enforcement in the area.
[01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:11.723]  So when the media tries to spit, oh, this is all fake.
[01:08:11.723 --> 01:08:12.484]  Yeah, right.
[01:08:12.484 --> 01:08:15.925]  Yeah, you wish it was fake.
[01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:21.987]  We learned that men were inside that had come down and given money to the quote Catholic charity.
[01:08:21.987 --> 01:08:23.328]  That's about as Catholic as a $3 bill.
[01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:26.169]  It's as strong as a $3 bill.
[01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:26.229]  And
[01:08:30.419 --> 01:08:36.002]  They were picking these women and children up, and they wanted women that didn't have men with them.
[01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:41.925]  For labor, and to teach them the way of God the way they were going to teach them.
[01:08:41.925 --> 01:08:47.208]  And let me tell you, the creep factor on this is, out of a 1 out of a 10, it's about an 11.
[01:08:47.208 --> 01:08:51.030]  To quote your spinal tap stuff right there.
[01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:53.511]  So, this is the complete collapse of the border.
[01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:54.511]  Totally insane.
[01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:59.194]  I'm going to actually play a clip of that last segment of this hour, but here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:00.032]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:00.092]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.092 --> 01:09:00.152]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:00.212]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.212 --> 01:09:00.312]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.312 --> 01:09:00.372]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.372 --> 01:09:00.432]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:00.493]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.493 --> 01:09:00.553]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:00.673]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.673 --> 01:09:00.753]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.753 --> 01:09:00.813]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.813 --> 01:09:00.893]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.893 --> 01:09:00.993]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:01.053]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:01.153]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.153 --> 01:09:01.233]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:01.293]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.293 --> 01:09:01.373]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.373 --> 01:09:01.433]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:01.513]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:01.593]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.593 --> 01:09:01.653]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.653 --> 01:09:01.714]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:01.714 --> 01:09:01.754]  877-789-2539
[01:09:30.976 --> 01:09:38.258]  On all of these issues, and I really look forward to doing that.
[01:09:38.258 --> 01:09:58.222]  One thing I didn't get to with the, it's not even the ADL now, it's, I mean the ADL was not as bad under Abe Foxman, it's much worse under the new guy because he's actually an Obama, works for Obama directly, which is basically a jihadi, so now it's like a jihadi worship, open border worship, actually anti-Israel facility.
[01:10:00.862 --> 01:10:02.443]  Again, I'm not even against Israel.
[01:10:02.443 --> 01:10:03.984]  That's what I'm saying here.
[01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:08.406]  I believe people have a right to a homeland.
[01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:16.109]  But if you go look at what the ADL does today, the ADL actually now wants a two-state solution.
[01:10:16.109 --> 01:10:27.735]  That's older ADL doctrine when they said you can't have replacement migration in Israel because if you bring in a majority of people from outside, especially Muslims, they'll overthrow us and kick us out, which of course is true.
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:34.252]  I mean, we can bring in all these people from Latin America and teach them how to be Americans.
[01:10:34.252 --> 01:10:35.052]  They'd make great people.
[01:10:35.052 --> 01:10:35.873]  They're awesome!
[01:10:35.873 --> 01:10:37.213]  Hell, most people I know, they're listeners.
[01:10:37.213 --> 01:10:38.014]  I go to events.
[01:10:38.014 --> 01:10:40.555]  Half of them are people that came here legally from all over the world.
[01:10:40.555 --> 01:10:41.696]  A lot of them are Latin Americans.
[01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:42.676]  They're great people.
[01:10:42.676 --> 01:10:48.599]  But they came here legally because they wanted to get away from communism, not come here and become it again.
[01:10:48.599 --> 01:10:56.623]  So, that's why I never really attack the ADL or groups, because it's different factions and it just feeds into what they want.
[01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.244]  At the left is infighting.
[01:10:59.244 --> 01:11:04.486]  But at a certain point, it's just too much.
[01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:11.169]  Because Tucker Carlson reads from the official Democratic Party doctrine, he's now a Nazi?
[01:11:11.169 --> 01:11:14.230]  How dare you?
[01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:16.471]  Tucker Carlson's family fought the Nazis.
[01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:17.892]  My family fought the Nazis.
[01:11:17.892 --> 01:11:18.712]  How dare you?
[01:11:18.712 --> 01:11:23.795]  How dare you come here when we saved you and do this to us?
[01:11:23.795 --> 01:11:24.475]  How dare you?
[01:11:27.236 --> 01:11:29.416]  If you have any decency, you'll cease and desist.
[01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:30.177]  It's disgusting!
[01:11:30.177 --> 01:11:41.139]  I actually know about Peter Carlson's family and what they've done to this country.
[01:11:41.139 --> 01:11:42.719]  There's people that know that stuff, know that stuff.
[01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:45.760]  You don't know anything about it.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.280]  How dare you?
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.441]  Disgusting.
[01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.161]  So you talk about that.
[01:11:54.966 --> 01:11:59.930]  But let's hit this right now before we go to break and come back with your calls.
[01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:03.573]  And I'm just going to have time to read you the stack, because it's like 50 articles.
[01:12:03.573 --> 01:12:04.533]  Now get ready for this.
[01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:07.356]  You've got to go check these out for yourself.
[01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.537]  Before I hit these, I thought I would just read this.
[01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:12.920]  Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[01:12:16.744 --> 01:12:26.508]  This is over 10 years ago in the Times of London saying that Bill Gates and others met in secret to discuss world government to carry out depopulation.
[01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:33.471]  Right here at the end they talk about the world government they are forming.
[01:12:33.471 --> 01:12:36.652]  Let us continue.
[01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:37.392]  The island of St.
[01:12:37.392 --> 01:12:42.755]  Vincent is holding everyone hostage so they take vaccines and you can't leave with a volcano going off.
[01:12:42.755 --> 01:12:43.555]  Total tyranny.
[01:12:45.183 --> 01:12:50.166]  Only vaccinated people can be evacuated from Ireland to escape volcano, says Prime Minister, Infowars.com.
[01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:55.089]  1 in 4 Brits will refuse to go to pubs or restaurants because they have to show a vaccine passport.
[01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:56.990]  That's fine, next we'll be able to shop at a grocery store.
[01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.412]  This is a takeover.
[01:12:59.412 --> 01:13:02.754]  When police start raiding our churches, you know the revolution has begun.
[01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:07.997]  They are SWAT teaming churches all over Canada, all over Australia, all over England, but everything else can stay open.
[01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:09.138]  This is total communism.
[01:13:11.269 --> 01:13:13.971]  Big report at Band.Video that just got posted.
[01:13:13.971 --> 01:13:16.793]  Bill Gates admits to human depopulation program.
[01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:20.336]  See the monster for yourself.
[01:13:20.336 --> 01:13:25.560]  Supreme Court rules against Governor Newsom's limits on in-home religious gatherings.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.143]  Yeah, they want Soviet-style even banning those.
[01:13:29.143 --> 01:13:35.208]  Human rights lawyer goes off on California Board of Education for wanting to secretly vaccinate children without telling their parents.
[01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:35.708]  Huge video.
[01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:38.930]  We'll play it at the start of the next segment.
[01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:40.792]  But just call her a Nazi and have her taken away.
[01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:49.009]  COVID vaccine clinic at Dick's Sporting Goods cancelled after many sent to the hospital sick.
[01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:50.590]  Collapsing.
[01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:51.751]  But they say that's just part of it.
[01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:52.871]  It's normal.
[01:13:52.871 --> 01:14:02.635]  It's also normal, like, Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Hank Aaron and now DMX all dying.
[01:14:02.635 --> 01:14:06.036]  Nearly 40%- I took a shot.
[01:14:06.036 --> 01:14:09.318]  Nearly 40% of Marines have declined COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:14:09.318 --> 01:14:10.258]  There, you read the number.
[01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:13.237]  The vast majority have actually refused.
[01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:14.417]  They're just spitting the numbers.
[01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:18.118]  You gotta go read it for yourself.
[01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:23.420]  Again, report rapper DMX received COVID jab before suffering fatal heart attack.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.060]  Brzezinski!
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:29.662]  It's infinitely easier to kill a million people, including Americans, than it is to control them.
[01:14:29.662 --> 01:14:30.522]  That's the adopted plan.
[01:14:31.647 --> 01:14:36.849]  Real-world Israeli study shows South African variant can break through Pfizer vaccine.
[01:14:36.849 --> 01:14:38.470]  That's what all the scientists said a year ago.
[01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:43.312]  You can't have one for the common cold, because it always mutates, and that's what COVID's based on.
[01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:49.095]  All a fraud, but oh, now you gotta have a shot for every new variant every few weeks.
[01:14:49.095 --> 01:14:52.957]  You shall still be wearing a mask, even if you got the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:14:52.957 --> 01:14:53.717]  Here's why.
[01:14:53.717 --> 01:14:56.838]  See, never take the mask off.
[01:14:56.838 --> 01:15:00.400]  Once they get you in a trap, they never let you out of the trap.
[01:15:01.674 --> 01:15:05.040]  Now they're trying to say children are all these bug monsters.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.302]  They've all got to wear masks.
[01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:07.944]  They've all got to take shots forever.
[01:15:07.944 --> 01:15:08.906]  Oh, the cult never ends.
[01:15:08.906 --> 01:15:12.872]  You know, all the studies show if you're not in contact with people, you have no immune system and get sicker.
[01:15:12.872 --> 01:15:15.056]  They're teaching us we're all dirty, we're all bad for depopulation.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:26.903]  Spar's plan 2025-2028, page 64 said, oh there's going to be neurological disorders from the vaccine, but we'll just claim it's a new virus doing it.
[01:15:26.903 --> 01:15:28.243]  Well now, here it is.
[01:15:28.243 --> 01:15:33.725]  One in three COVID survivors develop neurological or psychotic problems within six months.
[01:15:33.725 --> 01:15:35.025]  Yeah, because they've taken the vaccine.
[01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:39.026]  That's in the studies it does all of that.
[01:15:39.026 --> 01:15:40.026]  That's just some of the news.
[01:15:40.026 --> 01:15:42.347]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:15:42.347 --> 01:15:44.087]  The globalists have made their move.
[01:15:44.087 --> 01:15:47.308]  The designed Great Reset collapse of society is now.
[01:15:47.308 --> 01:15:50.589]  Doesn't matter if you're black, white, Christian, Jewish, old, young, Muslim.
[01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.330]  You're all under globalist attack.
[01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:53.730]  That's why they're dividing and conquering us.
[01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:57.531]  Come together!
[01:15:57.531 --> 01:16:05.093]  When I tell you to supplement your natural diet so you'll be healthier and fund the M4 at the same time, I'm not lecturing you.
[01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:10.794]  I eat too much red meat, I drink too much, I work too much, I have my own issues with stress.
[01:16:10.794 --> 01:16:20.804]  But I can tell you, without Winter Sun, without Vitamin Mineral Fusion, without Lung Cleanse, all three of which I take every day, I would not be able to continue in what I do.
[01:16:20.804 --> 01:16:25.189]  These are amazing products and if you don't have the essential vitamins and minerals,
[01:16:25.985 --> 01:16:27.366]  You're not going to be able to function.
[01:16:27.366 --> 01:16:28.667]  In fact, you're going to die.
[01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:31.610]  That's why people starve, for lack of food.
[01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:38.875]  These products have it all concentrated in one place for you, to make sure that every essential vitamin or mineral you need, you get.
[01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:46.802]  The D3, the K, in winter sun, and all of them together, with amino acids, and vitamin or mineral fusion, and then lung cleanse.
[01:16:47.563 --> 01:16:49.404]  Again, I don't like to lecture people.
[01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:57.409]  I'm a very private person, but because of the globalists and their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure.
[01:17:06.615 --> 01:17:10.678]  And we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[01:17:10.678 --> 01:17:14.660]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.081]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:21.143]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear.
[01:17:21.143 --> 01:17:21.564]  And I get it.
[01:17:21.564 --> 01:17:23.325]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[01:17:23.325 --> 01:17:25.466]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt.
[01:17:26.397 --> 01:17:26.698]  We're good.
[01:17:41.816 --> 01:17:43.677]  And so that's what InfoWars is really all about.
[01:17:43.677 --> 01:17:45.458]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.

[01:19:54.117 --> 01:19:55.538]  The revolution starts there.

[01:20:01.643 --> 01:20:04.305]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:21.882]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:21.882 --> 01:20:25.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.723 --> 01:20:29.244]  All right, folks.
[01:20:29.244 --> 01:20:33.506]  Lee Dundas is a constitutional lawyer out in California.
[01:20:33.506 --> 01:20:39.167]  She was at a Orange County event where they're talking about inoculating children without parental consent and more.
[01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:42.688]  She points out it's not a vaccine machine therapy and it violates law.
[01:20:42.688 --> 01:20:43.768]  This is not an approved vaccine.
[01:20:43.768 --> 01:20:45.509]  That's why they can't order the military to take it.
[01:20:46.104 --> 01:20:48.326]  Yeah, and they can't order you to take any vaccine.
[01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:49.807]  But it's all pure intimidation.
[01:20:49.807 --> 01:20:54.091]  And then, during the break, I go, let me go to InfoWars.com.
[01:20:54.091 --> 01:20:56.894]  I haven't checked my own site in about 15 minutes.
[01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:57.514]  Boom!
[01:20:57.514 --> 01:21:00.697]  You know that big church in Canada?
[01:21:00.697 --> 01:21:06.282]  Alberta, Canada, that they put the fence up around because they refuse to stay closed, but the Walmart stays open down the street?
[01:21:06.966 --> 01:21:08.608]  Call the left, see what they can do?
[01:21:08.608 --> 01:21:13.654]  They attacked it with 200 armed police and riot gear like out of Tiananmen Square.
[01:21:13.654 --> 01:21:14.255]  And I'm watching.
[01:21:14.255 --> 01:21:15.697]  We're getting the clips right now.
[01:21:15.697 --> 01:21:16.838]  We'll have it next segment for you.
[01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:20.122]  I'm going to take some calls too, but here's the footage out of Orange County.
[01:21:20.874 --> 01:21:22.414]  Lee Dundas, Human Rights Attorney.
[01:21:22.414 --> 01:21:38.659]  Late last week, I am informed a meeting occurred between Orange County Health Officer Dr. Clayton Schau and Orange County Board of Education Superintendent Al Meharas, during which time they apparently tried to find a way to, quote, sidestep and entirely remove informed parental consent for the COVID vaccine and also turn Orange County school campuses into vaccination centers.
[01:21:39.059 --> 01:21:50.127]  The COVID-19 vaccine is an experimental medical protocol authorized under the Emergency Use Authorization Act, and as such, you cannot mandate it for anyone, nor can you sidestep informed consent.
[01:21:50.127 --> 01:22:00.394]  There is a reason that kids cannot smoke, drive, drink, have sex, vote, or die for this country, and it is because the law says they lack the capacity to understand those decisions, and that applies here more than ever.
[01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:02.777]  Hear me loud and hear me well.
[01:22:02.777 --> 01:22:18.876]  We will not be morphing our school campuses into COVID vaccine centers for delivery of an experimental medical protocol that killed every damned ferret in the last animal study they did until such time they had to abandon that study and then and then they didn't even do the study this time around because we are the study.
[01:22:19.565 --> 01:22:27.147]  The last time humans launched a plan like this to conduct experimental medical protocols on vulnerable populations was in Joseph Mengele's direction.
[01:22:27.147 --> 01:22:30.188]  He was an MD known as the Angel of Death.
[01:22:30.188 --> 01:22:30.748]  Okay?
[01:22:30.748 --> 01:22:43.171]  And he was part of the SS and in 1943 he was assigned to Auschwitz where he saw an opportunity to conduct gene research, quote, focused primarily on children with no regard for the health or safety of the victims.
[01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:44.731]  This is off the internet, you can Google it.
[01:22:45.231 --> 01:22:46.832]  You know what else is gene research?
[01:22:46.832 --> 01:22:50.135]  Experimental COVID vaccines with a transgene inside of it.
[01:22:50.135 --> 01:22:54.097]  If you don't believe me, go pull the EUA application for the J&J shot.
[01:22:54.097 --> 01:22:57.880]  I come from a long line of Eastern Europeans, Hungarians, and Romanian groups.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:10.349]  Groups that fled the persecution of the Red Terror Communist death squads in the early 1900s, and those of us who didn't make it to America ended up facing the Nazi death squads in the lesser-known Holocaust that was the Romani Holocaust.
[01:23:10.349 --> 01:23:13.051]  There is a reason my daughter is named Katia.
[01:23:14.091 --> 01:23:21.279]  Her Romani great-grandmother was Katerina Choma, and I, for one, have not forgotten the lessons of our history.
[01:23:21.279 --> 01:23:25.564]  The Third Reich did not end with experiments on children, nor when those children died.
[01:23:25.564 --> 01:23:34.194]  The Third Reich ended in 1946, when we put the doctors who committed these human experiments on trial in Nuremberg, and then we put them to death.
[01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:39.737]  It ended with the adoption of the Nuremberg Code, so we would never repeat the sins of history.
[01:23:39.737 --> 01:23:44.520]  And it states, and I quote, the voluntary consent of this human subject is absolutely essential.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.222]  Dr. Chow and Dr. Maharish, you are hereby on notice.
[01:23:48.222 --> 01:24:01.930]  Last week, you appear to have knowingly hatched a plan to sidestep and or violate international, federal, and state law, not just the Nuremberg Informed Consent Language, but also the Black Letter Law, the EUA, as well as California state law, which punishes, and I quote,
[01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:08.354]  The willful failure to obtain a subject's informed consent by imprisonment in county jail for one year, or the imposition of a $50,000 fine, or both!
[01:24:10.896 --> 01:24:32.503]  Through the planned insertion of experimental gene-altering protocols onto the very children, you were elected and charged with protecting, and tonight we are asking the Board of Education for an immediate letter of censure to these individuals, and if they don't resign for an immediate notice of termination, and that letter also needs to go to the professional boards because they have no business being in these positions.
[01:24:32.503 --> 01:24:38.685]  So help me God, the people of Orange County will hold this policy to account.
[01:24:39.719 --> 01:24:43.762]  Okay, I want to get her on as a guest, probably a talk show host.
[01:24:43.762 --> 01:24:46.383]  I mean, I love my wife, but I may have to marry her.
[01:24:46.383 --> 01:24:49.105]  My spirit animal wife is that lady.
[01:24:49.105 --> 01:24:50.686]  Wow, that's the spirit we need.
[01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:52.107]  I love it.
[01:24:52.107 --> 01:24:52.587]  I love it.
[01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:57.730]  And she had three minutes to talk, and she blasted them with pure truth.
[01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:00.792]  Hey, Owen Schroeder does a great job, and he works so many hours.
[01:25:00.792 --> 01:25:01.913]  He's going on the border tomorrow.
[01:25:02.808 --> 01:25:05.689]  And he was going to be hosting remotely today.
[01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:07.209]  I'm going to give him the day off.
[01:25:07.209 --> 01:25:08.290]  He deserves it.
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:11.310]  You're going to get four hours of Alex Jones tonight on Sunday.
[01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:14.411]  I'm hosting hour number three and hour number four.
[01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:17.072]  And there's only six minutes of ads an hour then.
[01:25:17.072 --> 01:25:18.672]  We just have ads for all stations.
[01:25:18.672 --> 01:25:24.114]  So Sunday Live is going to be hosted by yours truly tonight.
[01:25:24.114 --> 01:25:25.274]  So look for that.
[01:25:25.274 --> 01:25:27.475]  I know Patrick Halley was scheduled to be on with a guest.
[01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:28.595]  So they want to come on second hour.
[01:25:28.595 --> 01:25:29.895]  I'm happy to talk to those guys as well.
[01:25:29.895 --> 01:25:31.876]  But I see these loaded lines with
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:50.965]  Lisa, and Ken, and Andrew, and Willard, and Lucy, and Matt, and Elizabeth, and Kevin, and Kevin, and Corey, and Troy, I'm going to your calls on the other side, and we'll probably get to all these this hour in the next two segments, but if we don't, it's okay, because Tim Cook runs death camps.
[01:25:50.965 --> 01:25:52.966]  So, that's all coming up
[01:25:54.562 --> 01:26:05.585]  Today, we're going to ask the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center Democratic Party, why do you help Apple and others run death camps while you tell us if we love the Second Amendment or America or low taxes, we're Nazis!
[01:26:05.585 --> 01:26:07.145]  We're sick of being called that, man!
[01:26:07.145 --> 01:26:11.686]  And I've got all the footage of Anthony from burning more police stations down.
[01:26:11.686 --> 01:26:14.547]  Did you know now?
[01:26:14.547 --> 01:26:19.368]  Did you know now that it'd be okay if Hitler killed all those people if he was gay?
[01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:22.351]  I don't care if you're gay, actually.
[01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:26.292]  My point is, is that Tim Cook's gay and they go, well, it's okay if he runs death camps in China.
[01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:26.952]  I mean, he's gay.
[01:26:26.952 --> 01:26:29.033]  I mean, he rides a bicycle to work.
[01:26:29.033 --> 01:26:31.034]  I mean, it's like Pete Buttigieg.
[01:26:31.034 --> 01:26:31.994]  I mean, it's not to me.
[01:26:31.994 --> 01:26:35.895]  It's not some feat that Pete, you know, he's got boyfriends.
[01:26:35.895 --> 01:26:36.836]  Oh, wow.
[01:26:36.836 --> 01:26:38.896]  That's so impressive, Pete.
[01:26:38.896 --> 01:26:40.097]  And what else do you do?
[01:26:40.097 --> 01:26:43.198]  Do you stay on your head?
[01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.279]  But then he gets on his bike and stages all of that.
[01:26:47.882 --> 01:26:51.563]  And rides one block to the White House saying he rode in 10 miles.
[01:26:51.563 --> 01:26:53.863]  He's a fraud!
[01:26:53.863 --> 01:26:57.564]  And that's why I don't like Tim Cook or Pete Bootyjudge or any of these people.
[01:26:57.564 --> 01:27:02.124]  We're going to go to break, come right back to your phone calls, but let me just throw this out there.
[01:27:02.124 --> 01:27:06.545]  We had 2,000 in-game blueprints for Global Enslavement that I'd even forgotten we had.
[01:27:06.545 --> 01:27:14.027]  Three-hour documentary film made 14 years ago, evergreen, exposes the whole globalist great reset depopulation.
[01:27:14.027 --> 01:27:15.387]  I mentioned we only had 2,000.
[01:27:15.387 --> 01:27:16.467]  They all sold in one day.
[01:27:17.435 --> 01:27:19.456]  So I ordered $20,000 a month ago.
[01:27:19.456 --> 01:27:22.617]  They came in Friday on an 18-wheeler from Chicago.
[01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:26.279]  The levy broke from Chicago, and in came all those DVDs.
[01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:28.800]  And I'm selling them for $14.95 for one, $9.95 for two, $8.95 for three.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.941]  If you buy five, they're $5.95 a piece.
[01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:47.032]  Now when you buy 10, they're $3.95 a piece.
[01:27:47.032 --> 01:27:50.694]  That's 74% off.
[01:27:50.694 --> 01:27:56.037]  In the age of censorship, and this thing was number one on Amazon until they took it down, have the hard copy.
[01:27:56.037 --> 01:28:00.260]  It has a zero country code on it, meaning anybody can make copies anywhere in the world.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:05.823]  So if you're in Australia, it's worth it to jump to the hoops to order 10 of these, get them into your country and make copies and wake them up.
[01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:08.245]  Because people watch this now, they were freaked out.
[01:28:08.245 --> 01:28:10.306]  This was number one on Amazon 14 years ago.
[01:28:10.839 --> 01:28:16.042]  We sold 300,000 copies of this on Amazon alone when it came out 14 years ago.
[01:28:16.042 --> 01:28:19.645]  I helped fund the operation with this.
[01:28:19.645 --> 01:28:22.306]  I was selling them for $19 then.
[01:28:22.306 --> 01:28:27.770]  I'm selling them basically right at almost cost for you at InfoWareStore.com when you get a 10-pack.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.600]  Forget one.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.240]  Make copies of it.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.021]  I don't care.
[01:28:31.021 --> 01:28:31.461]  Endgame.
[01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:32.541]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:33.721]  Must have it in your library.
[01:28:33.721 --> 01:28:35.122]  Donate it to your local library.
[01:28:35.122 --> 01:28:37.302]  Give it to your police chief, your mayor, your pastor.
[01:28:37.302 --> 01:28:37.962]  It's incredible.
[01:28:37.962 --> 01:28:39.883]  It's like what's happening now.
[01:28:39.883 --> 01:28:40.843]  The Great Reset.
[01:28:40.843 --> 01:28:41.383]  Endgame.
[01:28:41.383 --> 01:28:43.584]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.104]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:45.104 --> 01:28:46.805]  And our sale on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:28:46.805 --> 01:28:48.065]  All the vitamins, all the minerals.
[01:28:48.065 --> 01:28:49.105]  Liquid multivitamin.
[01:28:49.105 --> 01:28:50.946]  Highest quality for adults, children, old folks.
[01:28:50.946 --> 01:28:51.906]  So important for your immune system.
[01:28:51.906 --> 01:28:52.926]  It's getting in a few days.
[01:28:52.926 --> 01:28:54.867]  We're about to sell out of it again.
[01:28:54.867 --> 01:28:55.547]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:28:57.629 --> 01:29:00.355]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[01:29:01.889 --> 01:29:02.990]  And I just want to say something.
[01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:07.774]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[01:29:07.774 --> 01:29:12.698]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:29:12.698 --> 01:29:15.601]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:18.963]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:18.963 --> 01:29:20.184]  You've got red blood.
[01:29:20.184 --> 01:29:29.973]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:29:30.653 --> 01:29:34.494]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:37.395]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:29:37.395 --> 01:29:42.256]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:29:42.256 --> 01:29:44.876]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:29:44.876 --> 01:29:49.317]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:53.418]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:29:53.418 --> 01:29:56.379]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support InfoHorse.
[01:29:56.379 --> 01:29:56.759]  God bless.
[01:29:58.243 --> 01:29:59.306]  It's very simple.
[01:29:59.306 --> 01:30:06.242]  Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking a high-quality multivitamin mineral every single day.
[01:30:06.997 --> 01:30:12.840]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed, in fact, in many cases are toxic.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:23.446]  But Vitamin Mineral Fusion, in stock right now, 40% off at Infowarsstore.com, has high-grade vitamins and minerals that are all essential, with key amino acids so your body can upload.
[01:30:23.446 --> 01:30:28.849]  And it's all at Infowarsstore.com, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:30:28.849 --> 01:30:29.309]  So go there
[01:30:29.349 --> 01:30:29.889]  I think so.
[01:30:52.396 --> 01:30:59.498]  The people are awakening.
[01:30:59.498 --> 01:31:02.219]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[01:31:02.219 --> 01:31:04.299]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[01:31:04.299 --> 01:31:06.640]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:14.462]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data.
[01:31:14.522 --> 01:31:15.163]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.919 --> 01:31:39.880]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:40.940]  They're Faraday cages.
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.641]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[01:31:42.641 --> 01:31:44.641]  They work absolutely great.
[01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:53.784]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[01:31:53.784 --> 01:31:56.205]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:31:57.412 --> 01:31:59.954]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[01:31:59.954 --> 01:32:03.656]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine.
[01:32:03.656 --> 01:32:10.821]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our families' sakes, but also our community.
[01:32:10.821 --> 01:32:17.766]  And citizenstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:21.549]  Again, this is high-quality body armor at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:32:21.549 --> 01:32:25.212]  We've worked with them for years, but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:26.993]  They have massively expanded their factories.

[01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.308]  10% off.
[01:32:47.308 --> 01:32:51.211]  And the globalists are coming to try to stop the sale of it soon.
[01:32:51.211 --> 01:32:53.933]  That's why you need to get it now at CitizenStronghold.com.
[01:32:53.933 --> 01:32:55.194]  Promo code ALEX and get 10% off.
[01:33:01.144 --> 01:33:03.806]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:26.937 --> 01:33:40.141]  Alright, I'm going to cover what's happening in Canada with our SWAT team raiding churches now with hundreds of riot police coming up here in just a moment.
[01:33:40.141 --> 01:33:52.525]  But I wanted to air this very important report for all of you that really illustrates exactly what we're facing.
[01:33:52.525 --> 01:33:53.025]  This is from 1995.
[01:33:56.341 --> 01:34:03.948]  It got reposted at Band.Video as the Jeff Davis Show, which is a local actually show that did a great job, but technically, this is not from the Jeff Davis Show.
[01:34:03.948 --> 01:34:08.553]  I remember when he aired this, he'd air this all the time, starting back in like 1995.
[01:34:08.553 --> 01:34:09.293]  Where'd he get it?
[01:34:09.293 --> 01:34:10.795]  He didn't know.
[01:34:10.795 --> 01:34:14.058]  So the providence of this video is not known.
[01:34:15.479 --> 01:34:37.163]  And so I'm simply asking everybody that watches this, millions of people tonight, to email us at showtipsandinfowars.com so I can find this church or group that made this about the Mark of the Beast and get them on 26, 27, 28, 29 years later and find out, you know, how they were so prescient about what's going on.
[01:34:37.163 --> 01:34:39.863]  Because a lot of this dovetails with what's happening today.
[01:34:39.863 --> 01:34:43.324]  If you want to see this full video on your radio listener, it's posted at Band
[01:34:44.418 --> 01:34:48.840]  That video is titled 1997 Mark of the Beast.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:54.603]  Here it is.
[01:34:54.603 --> 01:35:03.007]  And now the XYZ Evening News with Donald Quick.
[01:35:03.007 --> 01:35:04.028]  Good evening.
[01:35:04.028 --> 01:35:07.470]  I'm Donald Quick with the XYZ Evening News.
[01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:12.212]  Tonight we have a special report on the new economic system that went into effect just last week.
[01:35:13.052 --> 01:35:18.636]  Our special news correspondent, Shirley McMedia, brings you this report from a local supermarket.
[01:35:18.636 --> 01:35:19.357]  Shirley?
[01:35:19.357 --> 01:35:20.818]  Thanks, Don.
[01:35:20.818 --> 01:35:25.421]  Behind me, you'll see what looks like a normal line of customers paying for their groceries.
[01:35:25.421 --> 01:35:30.365]  But if you look very closely, you'll see that they're paying without money.
[01:35:30.365 --> 01:35:34.287]  All the customers have to do is place their hand over the laser scanner.
[01:35:34.287 --> 01:35:41.673]  It reads their personal identification number, then subtracts the amount of money they're paying for their groceries from the credit they have in their bank account.
[01:35:42.533 --> 01:35:48.714]  We've come down here to get the enthusiastic reactions of some of the first people to receive their credit marks.
[01:35:48.714 --> 01:35:52.155]  Ma'am, what do you think of the new cashless credit system?
[01:35:52.155 --> 01:35:53.175]  Oh, goodness!
[01:35:53.175 --> 01:35:54.315]  It's wonderful!
[01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:58.516]  I don't have to fiddle around in my purse anymore looking for change or write checks.
[01:35:58.516 --> 01:36:01.196]  It makes life so simple.
[01:36:01.196 --> 01:36:02.097]  Oh, the mark?
[01:36:02.097 --> 01:36:03.477]  I mean, it's just totally cool.
[01:36:03.477 --> 01:36:06.457]  It's like my own personal number on my body.
[01:36:06.457 --> 01:36:07.357]  Nobody can take it.
[01:36:07.357 --> 01:36:08.278]  I can't even lose it.
[01:36:08.278 --> 01:36:09.138]  Nobody can steal it.
[01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:10.198]  It's totally awesome.
[01:36:10.763 --> 01:36:12.224]  Yeah, I'm glad I got the mark.
[01:36:12.224 --> 01:36:15.146]  I feel a lot safer now, and I'm glad they made it mandatory.
[01:36:15.146 --> 01:36:27.034]  I think it'll make it easier for the law enforcement agencies to keep track on the criminals, and I think society will be a lot safer.
[01:36:27.034 --> 01:36:33.639]  And speaking of criminals, the government has issued a law making it illegal to buy or sell without the new credit mark.
[01:36:34.319 --> 01:36:39.563]  It is a criminal offense to refuse to get your own personal identification number.
[01:36:39.563 --> 01:36:43.205]  Shirley McMedia, XYZ News, at your local supermarket.
[01:36:43.205 --> 01:36:43.925]  Back to you, Don.
[01:36:43.925 --> 01:36:45.547]  Thanks, Shirley.
[01:36:45.547 --> 01:36:49.149]  You may be wondering, why would anyone want to refuse to get a credit mark anyway?
[01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:56.600]  Here's an interview with a religious fanatic who was picked up just this afternoon for failing to have a credit mark.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:08.384]  In fact, he was picked up in front of a credit registration center for passing out pamphlets claiming to expose the new world credit system as a sort of, quote, satanic conspiracy.
[01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:16.429]  Why did you refuse to take the mark?
[01:37:16.429 --> 01:37:21.170]  Because the Bible warns all true Christians not to take the mark in order to worship the world dictator which is known as the Antichrist in the Bible.
[01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:23.031]  So do you believe this is worth going to prison or even dying for?
[01:37:23.031 --> 01:37:24.211]  Of course I do!
[01:37:24.211 --> 01:37:27.512]  You know, I was arrested for warning other people about taking the mark before it's too late.
[01:37:27.512 --> 01:37:39.595]  You know, the Antichrist is going to be destroyed and Jesus is coming back soon and also said... Now with me on the show tonight is Pastor Demkoff, the pastor of one of the largest and most respected churches in our city.
[01:37:39.595 --> 01:37:40.195]  Pastor Demkoff,
[01:37:40.968 --> 01:37:47.092]  Does the Bible really say that it's wrong to respect, honor, and worship our great world leader?
[01:37:47.092 --> 01:37:48.954]  Oh no, no, no, no.
[01:37:48.954 --> 01:37:53.537]  I personally have received the mark myself and I've advised my congregation to do the same.
[01:37:53.537 --> 01:37:58.521]  It's mostly just these like religious fanatics who freak out about these type of things.
[01:37:58.521 --> 01:38:01.743]  But if you would read the Bible it clearly states in
[01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:12.926]  Romans 13, chapter 13, verses 1 through 7, that Christians should submit to the higher powers, as well as 1 Peter 2.17 that tells us to honor the king.
[01:38:12.926 --> 01:38:23.288]  So what could possibly be wrong with submitting to and worshipping our great world leader who's restored order to the world after the economic crash?
[01:38:23.288 --> 01:38:30.150]  It's just another level that the church is moving on to, and we're very excited about all the good things that the new world order is accomplishing.
[01:38:31.716 --> 01:38:33.178]  Thank you very much, Pastor.
[01:38:33.178 --> 01:38:35.981]  Now on to our next news feature.
[01:38:35.981 --> 01:38:47.835]  Although the economic outlook brightened considerably in the last week, the country has been rocked by a series of unprecedented natural disasters that have left relief and law enforcement agencies struggling to maintain law and order.
[01:38:48.783 --> 01:38:59.488]  Tornadoes have been ravaging the Midwest, and California was struck by the third major... Alright, ladies and gentlemen, so we want to find out who put this piece out, the full piece is at BandOnVideo, and there it goes.
[01:38:59.488 --> 01:39:03.590]  So that's like 26, 27, 28 years old at least.
[01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:05.271]  Let's go to Elizabeth in Florida.
[01:39:05.271 --> 01:39:06.011]  Thanks for holding.
[01:39:06.011 --> 01:39:07.592]  Plenty of time for all the callers.
[01:39:07.592 --> 01:39:10.593]  I'm going to host into Sunday Live next hour.
[01:39:10.593 --> 01:39:11.754]  Go ahead, Elizabeth, you're on the air.
[01:39:12.938 --> 01:39:13.678]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:13.678 --> 01:39:23.424]  First of all, I'm not sure if you know who I am or not, but I want you to know that I like you and respect you very much without any filters or go-betweens or anything else.
[01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.325]  But that being said... Well, I appreciate you.
[01:39:25.325 --> 01:39:26.766]  Go ahead.
[01:39:26.766 --> 01:39:31.728]  I did some research and I want to give this to you.
[01:39:31.728 --> 01:39:36.251]  Basically, I know she was talking about the Nuremberg Code in that clip that you played.
[01:39:37.089 --> 01:39:47.035]  And the Nuremberg Code, we have opted in sort of by proxy, but it's never been codified as part of our law in the United States.
[01:39:47.035 --> 01:39:53.299]  Through the Hippocratic Oath, they said, well, doctors should respect all life.
[01:39:53.299 --> 01:39:58.342]  Well, the Hippocratic Oath has been changed six times since then, and it doesn't really say that at all.
[01:39:58.342 --> 01:39:58.822]  Well, that's right.
[01:39:58.822 --> 01:40:01.484]  About 20 years ago, they began to get rid of it at most medical schools.
[01:40:02.598 --> 01:40:03.599]  Exactly.
[01:40:03.599 --> 01:40:11.245]  So, you know, some people say, well, okay, we're part of UNESCO, but we didn't opt into the world court.
[01:40:11.245 --> 01:40:15.248]  So that's pretty useless as a remedy.
[01:40:15.248 --> 01:40:25.896]  And also, I don't know if this fits in anywhere, but Obama signed that executive order approving behavioral experiments on the American public.
[01:40:25.896 --> 01:40:31.580]  The American people have been subject to so much experimentation over
[01:40:32.779 --> 01:40:39.103]  The course of, you know, at least the last century or more, that something really has to give here.
[01:40:39.103 --> 01:40:52.992]  And when I get up this morning and I read the New York Times, and I see them still touting these vaccines after your sparse, amazing broadcast, amazing, outstanding, award winning.
[01:40:52.992 --> 01:40:57.515]  I mean, I think you should win something for that.
[01:40:57.515 --> 01:40:58.116]  It was so.
[01:40:59.222 --> 01:41:03.205]  Well, we're going to do a whole part two on that because it's all parallel.
[01:41:03.205 --> 01:41:04.186]  It's incredible.
[01:41:04.186 --> 01:41:06.808]  I mean, let's raise this.
[01:41:06.808 --> 01:41:11.692]  Obama, nine, ten years ago, the headline, legalizes domestic propaganda.
[01:41:11.692 --> 01:41:12.833]  That was real.
[01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.174]  Everything else was beta test.
[01:41:14.174 --> 01:41:18.097]  Then they went real, weaponized, race war, culture war.
[01:41:18.097 --> 01:41:20.619]  CIA, at that point, legalized it.
[01:41:20.619 --> 01:41:24.402]  Trump never figured it out, never was able to reverse it because he was so compartmentalized.
[01:41:24.402 --> 01:41:25.323]  That's why they were so scared.
[01:41:25.323 --> 01:41:26.404]  He almost ended it.
[01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:27.761]  It is.
[01:41:40.407 --> 01:41:41.708]  Scary as hell.
[01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:46.331]  And I don't think people realize the risk that we are under at this very moment.
[01:41:46.331 --> 01:41:54.077]  Oh, ma'am, every instinct I've got is just to find the middle of nowhere place in the desert where nobody wants to go and just dig in.
[01:41:54.077 --> 01:41:56.099]  I mean, this is moving so fast.
[01:41:56.099 --> 01:41:58.600]  The lockdowns we just saw are just the prelude.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.625]  Can you imagine what it's going to be like in two years when tens of millions are dying from these vaccines?
[01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:08.708]  We're going to be the people curating these individuals.
[01:42:09.164 --> 01:42:11.445]  We're going to be the people taking care of everyone.
[01:42:11.445 --> 01:42:18.670]  Exactly, and then they're going to say, though, that, oh, the new virus got them because we didn't take the shot.
[01:42:18.670 --> 01:42:20.912]  And logic won't matter at that point.
[01:42:20.912 --> 01:42:24.414]  No, it's the shot that caused the whole thing.
[01:42:24.414 --> 01:42:28.917]  It's the shot that's going to kill people, not the fake virus.
[01:42:28.917 --> 01:42:30.037]  Powerfully said, Elizabeth.
[01:42:30.037 --> 01:42:30.918]  And don't worry, callers.
[01:42:31.636 --> 01:42:32.717]  Owen's going to pop in.
[01:42:32.717 --> 01:42:34.558]  He's going to the border tomorrow.
[01:42:34.558 --> 01:42:36.139]  So he's getting ready for that.
[01:42:36.139 --> 01:42:37.400]  He'll pop in at the start of the next hour.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.421]  I'll continue on with your calls.
[01:42:38.421 --> 01:42:40.883]  And then I think Patrick Alley was nice enough to host some of the shows.
[01:42:40.883 --> 01:42:41.663]  He's got some special guests.
[01:42:41.663 --> 01:42:43.365]  So I don't want to totally cancel him.
[01:42:43.365 --> 01:42:45.466]  I didn't know he was coming up.
[01:42:45.466 --> 01:42:47.208]  I thought I'd guest host with Owen.
[01:42:47.208 --> 01:42:49.249]  Then I learned he's getting ready to go to the border.
[01:42:49.249 --> 01:42:50.630]  So there's a lot happening here.
[01:42:50.630 --> 01:42:52.471]  We'll be right back with more of your calls in a few minutes.
[01:42:52.471 --> 01:42:58.256]  Thank you, Elizabeth.
[01:42:58.256 --> 01:42:59.917]  The equation is very simple.
[01:43:01.036 --> 01:43:10.616]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[01:43:11.756 --> 01:43:20.860]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:29.344]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[01:43:29.344 --> 01:43:36.107]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[01:43:37.167 --> 01:43:40.730]  It's hard to believe that we're already in the middle of April.
[01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:11.207]  And our border's collapsing and world government's being announced that Joe Biden's coming after our guns and trying to start a war with Russia, but told China they can take over Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[01:44:11.207 --> 01:44:16.951]  So China's done a blockade around Taiwan and is threatening to invade Hong Kong.
[01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:18.952]  They already sent troops into Hong Kong.
[01:44:18.952 --> 01:44:20.153]  This is madness.
[01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:24.456]  And our government's been hijacked now by these globalists and they're trying to shut us down.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.243]  They took our sponsors away a long time ago.
[01:44:28.243 --> 01:44:32.909]  But you sponsor us by buying products direct, so these are already great products you need.
[01:44:32.909 --> 01:44:40.960]  Whether it's Vitamin Refusion back in stock, or whether it's Winter Sun, or whether it's Lung Cleanse, they're all 40% off individually, 50% off when you order them in combos or together.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:45.222]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:44:45.222 --> 01:44:48.444]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:44:48.444 --> 01:44:50.846]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:13.646]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:45:13.646 --> 01:45:19.411]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[01:45:19.411 --> 01:45:31.003]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:45:31.603 --> 01:45:33.744]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:37.866]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:45:37.866 --> 01:45:48.471]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:45:48.471 --> 01:45:57.996]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[01:45:57.996 --> 01:45:58.656]  Thank you so much.
[01:45:59.537 --> 01:46:06.183]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[01:46:06.183 --> 01:46:14.970]  Even before I had an access TV show in the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun.
[01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:20.054]  In fact, you speak out and have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[01:46:20.054 --> 01:46:21.876]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World?
[01:46:23.921 --> 01:46:25.802]  We're not worthy!
[01:46:25.802 --> 01:46:29.744]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you.
[01:46:29.744 --> 01:46:31.785]  Because these topics are so huge, they're so real.
[01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:33.165]  But I'm trying to tell you the truth.
[01:46:33.165 --> 01:46:35.226]  I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do.
[01:46:35.226 --> 01:46:36.887]  The globalists love lying to you.
[01:46:36.887 --> 01:46:38.227]  They love manipulating you.
[01:46:38.227 --> 01:46:40.888]  They enjoy destroying humanity.
[01:46:40.888 --> 01:46:45.550]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:48.452]  That for me is really satanic and disgusting.
[01:46:48.452 --> 01:46:51.273]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole InfoWars crew
[01:46:52.928 --> 01:46:54.791]  We will never join the Globals.
[01:46:54.791 --> 01:46:56.873]  We will never knowingly manipulate you.
[01:46:56.873 --> 01:47:01.139]  Because we know we're all in this together.
[01:47:01.139 --> 01:47:03.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.527 --> 01:47:37.112]  That looks like thousands of people.
[01:47:37.112 --> 01:47:37.952]  Thousands of people.
[01:47:37.952 --> 01:47:39.073]  Stories on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:40.379 --> 01:47:42.320]  From NationalFile.com.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.620]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:45.081]  Video.
[01:47:45.081 --> 01:47:47.402]  200 armed riot police break up Christian church service.
[01:47:47.402 --> 01:47:52.984]  It's like thousands of people who saw this big church in Canada shut down.
[01:47:52.984 --> 01:47:54.765]  A mile away is a Walmart.
[01:47:54.765 --> 01:47:57.226]  Two miles away is another big store.
[01:47:57.226 --> 01:47:58.286]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:47:58.286 --> 01:48:00.127]  They can have full parking lots, whatever.
[01:48:00.127 --> 01:48:04.109]  But the police, literally like something out of a nightmare science fiction movie,
[01:48:05.038 --> 01:48:11.279]  Show up and start attacking them because you're not allowed to gather, period.
[01:48:11.279 --> 01:48:12.999]  These are just shameful people.
[01:48:12.999 --> 01:48:14.200]  My God.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.060]  This is like Poland under the Soviets.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.720]  It's like Russia under the Soviets.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.381]  This is like North Korea.
[01:48:20.381 --> 01:48:22.161]  Go ahead and roll this video with audio.
[01:48:22.161 --> 01:48:26.802]  Start it over, please.
[01:48:26.802 --> 01:48:28.642]  Now the shock troops are coming.
[01:48:28.642 --> 01:48:31.282]  Wow, this is real.
[01:48:31.282 --> 01:48:34.123]  So 200 cops against hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.181]  Monsters.
[01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:39.123]  God, they're monsters.
[01:48:39.123 --> 01:48:42.966]  They have gas masks, so they're getting ready for, uh... All in their COVID coat.
[01:48:42.966 --> 01:48:44.187]  Love how half the cops are women.
[01:48:44.187 --> 01:48:45.469]  You're on the wrong side!
[01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:55.242]  So we're at close to 200 cops now.
[01:48:55.242 --> 01:48:58.965]  Gas masks, visors and stuff.
[01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:01.267]  Gas masks.
[01:49:01.267 --> 01:49:02.708]  200 cops.
[01:49:02.708 --> 01:49:04.649]  This is the new Waco.
[01:49:04.649 --> 01:49:07.291]  This happened just hours ago.
[01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:08.472]  For one church.
[01:49:08.472 --> 01:49:10.153]  I would have led the show with this.
[01:49:10.153 --> 01:49:11.054]  Tiananmen Square.
[01:49:11.054 --> 01:49:13.236]  You know, now happening in Canada.
[01:49:13.236 --> 01:49:14.757]  And they can't get all the churches.
[01:49:16.209 --> 01:49:17.650]  So they're doing this as an example.
[01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:18.550]  Wow, video.
[01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:21.931]  200 armed police, riot police break up Christian church service.
[01:49:21.931 --> 01:49:23.892]  They begin assaulting them.
[01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:24.532]  Scroll down.
[01:49:24.532 --> 01:49:27.113]  Oh, there's more videos getting posted.
[01:49:27.113 --> 01:49:29.774]  They started pushing people out of the area.
[01:49:29.774 --> 01:49:31.494]  Thousands of Christians showed up.
[01:49:31.494 --> 01:49:33.155]  Beautiful job.
[01:49:33.155 --> 01:49:36.456]  We just got to keep fighting peacefully for the truth.
[01:49:36.456 --> 01:49:42.558]  And we have all the footage out of the UK of them coming in and breaking up churches.
[01:49:42.558 --> 01:49:45.139]  This is the true face of the Marxist globalist evil.
[01:49:45.769 --> 01:49:49.551]  Oh, but don't worry, Little Nass, in fact let's cover this now and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:49:49.551 --> 01:49:51.352]  I'm doing the whole next hour to go to your calls.
[01:49:51.352 --> 01:49:53.553]  I'll go to some of your calls in a minute.
[01:49:53.553 --> 01:50:06.720]  Little Nass, who mainly does children's programs and does Sesame Street programs with Elmo, that's had its own connection to pedophilia and police investigations with underage sex.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:12.783]  He rides a stripper pole, he has sex with the devil, then kills the devil, becomes Satan.
[01:50:12.783 --> 01:50:14.064]  Well, now they have put out
[01:50:15.106 --> 01:50:41.398]  on a popular video game, and he's endorsed this, called Animal Crossing, where the children can play the part of the devil on the children video game and have sex with Satan and then Little Nas character, that's a new skin, a new character, you can now become the devil and then have anal sex with the devil
[01:50:43.592 --> 01:50:49.955]  And you go into a satanic temple, you have sex with Satan, and then you become Satan.
[01:50:49.955 --> 01:51:11.985]  So, people are like, oh, well, you know, he's a children's music guy, but now he does shows on Sesame Street, but now, you know, he's an adult, he wants to have sex with Satan, you know, free speech, but the ADL doesn't want to tell girls to have free speech, and now they have sex, and he kills the devil and becomes the devil.
[01:51:13.308 --> 01:51:21.456]  So, all of that gets free speech.
[01:51:21.456 --> 01:51:23.818]  And it goes on and on.
[01:51:23.818 --> 01:51:29.643]  Elmo Puppeteer Kevin Clash Resigns As Second Man Files Lawsuit Over New Underage Sex Allegations.
[01:51:29.643 --> 01:51:32.486]  Well, that's Elmo, but maybe that guy's innocent.
[01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:38.532]  Let's just go back to the video for TV viewers of the video game on average for 10-year-old girls is what it's
[01:51:39.255 --> 01:51:48.938]  Basically listed as a girl's video game and little boy's video game where you're not a little girl anymore, wearing one of the little George Soros pink hats.
[01:51:48.938 --> 01:51:55.841]  You now turn into the devil and you go have sex with Satan and you become Satan.
[01:51:55.841 --> 01:52:02.723]  You're impregnated by Satan and then you become Satan.
[01:52:02.723 --> 01:52:07.565]  And this is their revolution, just getting you used to it and now forced inoculations, all of it.
[01:52:09.201 --> 01:52:14.285]  They are just putting it all in your face.
[01:52:14.285 --> 01:52:15.546]  Wow.
[01:52:15.546 --> 01:52:18.949]  Again, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show every Sunday night, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:52:18.949 --> 01:52:23.372]  I'll be hosting the first hour, at least, of Sunday Live.
[01:52:23.372 --> 01:52:27.455]  So, I forgot, Owen is dispatching back down to the border with crew tonight or tomorrow morning.
[01:52:27.455 --> 01:52:29.757]  So, I'll be hosting.
[01:52:29.757 --> 01:52:32.179]  And Patrick Howley was asked to do some of it.
[01:52:32.179 --> 01:52:38.144]  So, he'll be doing the fourth hour with two special guests on the whole trial going on in Minneapolis.
[01:52:39.033 --> 01:52:41.614]  Minnesota and more, so that's coming up.
[01:52:41.614 --> 01:52:43.155]  Please don't forget, without you we won't be here.
[01:52:43.155 --> 01:52:48.757]  We're about to end a big sale that is 40% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:52:48.757 --> 01:52:54.419]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, and the key amino acids that you need for your immune system.
[01:52:54.419 --> 01:52:58.580]  Adults, children, old people, young people, black, white, everybody needs it.
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:03.942]  Especially folks with dark skin that aren't getting enough sun year-round.
[01:53:03.942 --> 01:53:06.803]  You don't produce D3 unless you ingest it.
[01:53:07.501 --> 01:53:09.802]  And so it's 40% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:53:09.802 --> 01:53:12.163]  You can also call 888-253-3139.
[01:53:12.163 --> 01:53:25.009]  You can get it with our Winter Sun Highest Quality Organic Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K, key to your immune system, key to your cells, mitochondria, and warding off things.
[01:53:25.009 --> 01:53:25.709]  That is 50% off.
[01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:26.330]  Together, 100% review.
[01:53:29.537 --> 01:53:29.817]  All right.
[01:53:29.817 --> 01:53:31.498]  We've got a bunch of callers holding.
[01:53:31.498 --> 01:53:32.358]  Let's go to Kevin in Los Angeles.
[01:53:32.358 --> 01:53:33.438]  Thanks for holding.
[01:53:33.438 --> 01:53:33.678]  Go ahead.
[01:54:00.982 --> 01:54:03.964]  Yeah, a little bit of an audio problem there.
[01:54:03.964 --> 01:54:04.905]  Go ahead and try again.
[01:54:04.905 --> 01:54:06.446]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:54:06.446 --> 01:54:11.150]  Okay, it's a pleasure and an honor to be able to speak to you.
[01:54:11.150 --> 01:54:11.990]  Nice to talk to you, brother.
[01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.351]  Go ahead.
[01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:16.714]  I wanted to comment on Max Keiser.
[01:54:16.714 --> 01:54:18.935]  First, let me preface with this.
[01:54:18.935 --> 01:54:27.822]  Max Keiser is a really decent man, and I respect him, and he got me involved in cryptocurrency in 2012-2013.
[01:54:27.822 --> 01:54:28.242]  I bought Bitcoin.
[01:54:31.426 --> 01:54:40.634]  And I invested about $5,000 worth into Bitcoin alone, because that's all there was.
[01:54:40.634 --> 01:54:46.118]  But he's a well-known, what we call in the industry, a Bitcoin maxi.
[01:54:46.118 --> 01:54:48.160]  And he's all about Bitcoin.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.482]  Nothing else matters.
[01:54:50.482 --> 01:54:55.706]  And I think that's the wrong attitude, especially knowing what I know.
[01:54:55.706 --> 01:54:58.589]  He talks about CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[01:54:59.614 --> 01:55:24.800]  I speak about them too, but I also know that the central banks are building on a private network that was given to them by a company called Ripple, and they have an XRP token that they're going to utilize, and the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, they're all signed on, the ECB, the IMF,
[01:55:25.464 --> 01:55:30.086]  Sure, let me ask you this way, because that's the problem.
[01:55:30.086 --> 01:55:33.687]  I never got into Bitcoin, all the fighting about it, all the endless this, that.
[01:55:33.687 --> 01:55:34.948]  Is there an article about this?
[01:55:34.948 --> 01:55:39.430]  Is there someplace I can go read your synopsis?
[01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:50.494]  Well, I haven't wrote anything about it, but I do have a Pinterest blog, I guess, a blog that I post a lot of content on.
[01:55:50.494 --> 01:55:51.855]  Okay, so you have written about it.
[01:55:51.855 --> 01:55:52.715]  So tell us about that.
[01:55:54.033 --> 01:55:55.014]  Well, it's a blog.
[01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:57.776]  Listen, brother, here's the deal.
[01:55:57.776 --> 01:56:01.578]  I'm talking about collapsing borders, world government, New World Order, all that stuff.
[01:56:01.578 --> 01:56:03.640]  Cryptocurrencies are great, whatever.
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.382]  I'm just saying, talk to me like I'm five years old.
[01:56:06.382 --> 01:56:07.522]  What's the bottom line?
[01:56:07.522 --> 01:56:10.104]  You're saying you don't like Bitcoin?
[01:56:10.104 --> 01:56:11.745]  No, it's not that I don't like Bitcoin.
[01:56:11.745 --> 01:56:13.226]  I still own Bitcoin.
[01:56:13.226 --> 01:56:14.988]  But I have a lot of other coins.
[01:56:16.309 --> 01:56:20.090]  So you don't like Max Keiser being Bitcoin-centric.
[01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:22.371]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, Kevin.
[01:56:22.371 --> 01:56:22.972]  I really do.
[01:56:22.972 --> 01:56:27.413]  I'm just not smart enough about that to be able to have some discussion with you.
[01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:30.014]  It's like some aficionado of 57 Chevys.
[01:56:30.014 --> 01:56:34.456]  They're telling me about the type of heads it's got.
[01:56:34.456 --> 01:56:36.057]  I don't know about it.
[01:56:36.057 --> 01:56:38.638]  I know about the combustion engine.
[01:56:38.638 --> 01:56:39.918]  I just don't know about 57 Chevys.
[01:56:39.918 --> 01:56:41.799]  You know what I mean?
[01:56:41.799 --> 01:56:44.240]  Okay, listen.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:44.860]  I'm going to start
[01:56:46.078 --> 01:56:47.739]  The next hour.
[01:56:47.739 --> 01:56:49.900]  And we call it Sunday Live.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.681]  And we did this during the election.
[01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:53.842]  I may give the crew a break.
[01:56:53.842 --> 01:56:55.703]  I may cancel Sunday Live soon.
[01:56:55.703 --> 01:56:57.623]  I'm not going to cancel this Sunday show.
[01:56:57.623 --> 01:57:02.346]  I've been doing the Alex Jones Show for 15, 16 years, from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:02.346 --> 01:57:05.527]  But it's got to be fair to my crew, though, making fun of Carol Sun to do more.
[01:57:05.527 --> 01:57:09.009]  We may not even do it in a couple of weeks, because we've got so much to do in the field, so much happening.
[01:57:09.009 --> 01:57:12.190]  It's like a specialty show we did 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:13.831]  But tonight, it'll still be live.
[01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:16.792]  And so Sunday Live is coming up.
[01:57:16.792 --> 01:57:18.632]  Some stations carry it, some don't.
[01:57:18.632 --> 01:57:24.094]  But if they're not, go to Band.Video or InfoWars.com, Ford's live show, right now.
[01:57:24.094 --> 01:57:26.835]  Or just keep watching the main network feed at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:26.835 --> 01:57:31.597]  And I'm going to come back and get up there on Owen, go to the board tomorrow, and then I'm going to just run through your calls.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:37.928]  Lisa, Ken, Andrew, Willard, Lucy, Matt, Kevin, Cory, and Troy.
[01:57:37.928 --> 01:57:39.690]  Really appreciate you all.
[01:57:39.690 --> 01:57:42.114]  That's it for the Sunday Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:42.114 --> 01:57:44.578]  Sunday Live is coming up in two minutes.
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:58:01.525]  The ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at InfoWarsStore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com for the lowest price possible to complete your daily mouth cleaning routine.
[01:58:01.525 --> 01:58:12.269]  It is the perfect companion to the new activated charcoal toothpaste all under our new line by Dr. Jones Naturals that will naturally give your mouth and breath a deep clean.

[01:58:23.590 --> 01:58:34.782]  Not only fluoride-free, this mouthwash is completely free of other dangerous ingredients such as SLS, harsh detergents, BPA, and so much more.
[01:58:34.782 --> 01:58:38.847]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[01:58:38.847 --> 01:58:45.033]  So get your bottle of the new Activated Charcoal Mouthwash right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:48.018 --> 01:58:49.081]  It's very simple.
[01:58:49.081 --> 01:58:56.019]  Every household, not just in America, but worldwide, should be taking a high-quality multivitamin mineral every single day.
[01:58:56.758 --> 01:59:00.020]  But so many of the big brands are synthetics that are not even absorbed.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.042]  In fact, in many cases are toxic.
[01:59:26.778 --> 01:59:28.478]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
