[00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:10.630]  And I love how national media calls me, Washington Post, New York Times, you know, just, and they call me and sometimes I don't know who it is and I answer and they go, they start giggling and saying, oh, you better defend yourself.
[00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.310]  Boy, you're really getting torn up.
[00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.571]  Why don't you talk to us?
[00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:17.231]  And I tell them, I say, do you have any children?
[00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:18.752]  You know they're coming to kill them, right?
[00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:24.033]  You think I give a damn about you suing me or attacking me or any of this?
[00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:27.814]  When you people have signed on to the globalists murdering everyone?
[00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:29.674]  You psycho crazy people!
[00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:37.845]  I mean, they think they're getting to me, lying about me everywhere, and sending white supremacists to try to get it.
[00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:39.345]  I mean, you people are nuts.
[00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.186]  You people are demonic.
[00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:41.866]  You're crazy.
[00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:43.927]  You're crazy!
[00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:53.451]  And you look at me, a normal person that does research and cares, and doesn't want toxic waste and poison forced on us by a bunch of eugenicists that say they want to depopulate us.
[00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:55.352]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all of them.
[00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:58.854]  And now they're running our medical system, and of course it's killing us!
[00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:01.094]  And you've got Stockholm Syndrome, though.
[00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:03.436]  You can't admit it's happening, or you're part of it.
[00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:09.160]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:29.559]   Well, every time I think I've seen something so unbelievable that it can't be topped by the globalist worldwide medical tyranny depopulation rollout, The New World Order just does something even more insane.
[00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:36.423]  And then by the time that's even covered, something even more horrible unfolds.
[00:01:38.705 --> 00:02:06.134]   Yesterday, at about 4.30, I was going to go home early and spend time with my young daughter, my wife, and I went in my office and hit refresh on Infowars.com and there was a big article with this headline, FDA documents show Pfizer secretly added heart attack drug to children's COVID vaccines.
[00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:19.384]  So then I spent an hour at least going through and going to the FDA's own website and indeed seeing that this has now been announced 10 days before and it got no coverage.
[00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:24.690]  Alex Jones didn't know about it for 10 days.
[00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:29.513]  And I sent the documents off to other prominent talk show hosts.
[00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:30.194]  They hadn't heard of it.
[00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:38.559]  That's how high level the censor is because there were some medical doctors and scientists and news sites that did report on it eight days ago.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.561]  It broke 12 days ago.
[00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.263]  That is just so incredible.
[00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:50.388]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you realize how illegal that is?
[00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:54.089]  It's one thing to have them say, oh, they've approved an experimental shot.
[00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.510]  And that, of course, was illegal.
[00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:13.697]  But now they add a very strong heart attack drug that you give somebody once they've had a heart attack to stabilize the heart that has horrible side effects and is extremely strong and extremely toxic.
[00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:20.311]   And so then at a couple more hours research, And it turned out that Rob Dude knew about this six days ago.
[00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:21.232]  And I'm not mad at Rob.
[00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:27.734]  It's just that we're so punch drunk to this evil that, oh, they added a heart attack drug secretly to the shot and didn't tell anybody.
[00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.375]  And now they just buried it in an FDA announcement.
[00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:33.757]  And 12 days later, Alex Jones doesn't know about it.
[00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.178]  Or 11 days later, last night.
[00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.140]  I mean, we could talk for the next four hours just about that.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.701]  And I've got stuff just as horrible, just as crazy.
[00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:51.450]  Australia has now announced that they're going to declare martial law around Christmas and anyone that doesn't take injections is locked in their house.
[00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.071]  And they say then if you go bankrupt, that's fine.
[00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:55.231]  You're going to be put in a camp.
[00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:56.372]  That's been announced.
[00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:59.833]  I have mainstream news here reporting it like it's a good thing.
[00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:05.216]  Associated Press, Australian leader says lockdown for unvaccinated is likely.
[00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:09.157]  They said we're going to make it very uncomfortable for you.
[00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:10.198]  We're going to take your house.
[00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:15.388]  And then it gets crazier because do you know what just happened last night?
[00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:26.418]  The fourth European country in a week banned the Moderna shot in under 30s because of the massive heart attack and myocarditis issues and blood clots.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.522]  At least a 15-fold increase.
[00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.132]  And to watch him on CNN last night trying to spin it.
[00:04:35.172 --> 00:04:36.092]  I saw the clip this morning.
[00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:38.993]  It was Anderson Cooper like, well, that's not that common.
[00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.955]  I mean, it's 15 times, 15 times increase.
[00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:45.796]  And so now Germany has banned it.
[00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.391]  So, and a bunch of countries have banned the Pfizer too.
[00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:50.732]  India, China, you name it.
[00:04:51.052 --> 00:05:03.758]  So they're trying to give and are giving five-year-olds, evil brainwashed parents are running out as well, and injecting their five-year-olds with something that embraces their immune system and can give them cancer, blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:06.659]  I mean, wow!
[00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.220]  And it just gets more insane.
[00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:13.042]  And remember, everything you see in Australia and Europe's coming here next.
[00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:15.954]  They're getting ready for martial law in Canada as well.
[00:05:16.414 --> 00:05:18.536]  This is the takeover, folks, by the UN.
[00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:30.385]  In the 21st century, war is carried out by covert means under the shroud, under the cover of medical necessity.
[00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:36.209]  Here we are, living in such a historic and incredibly dangerous time.
[00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:40.973]  Well, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:44.374]  Tromethamine.
[00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:46.374]  Tromethamine.
[00:05:46.374 --> 00:05:48.374]  Tromethamine.
[00:05:48.374 --> 00:05:50.374]  Tromethamine.
[00:05:50.374 --> 00:06:00.374]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:53.245 --> 00:06:24.185]   That's what was announced 12 days ago in a FDA posting on their site about their emergency authorization For five and ups of the experimental Pfizer injection, which they then said was approved under a drug name that is approved in the year 2026, four plus years from now.
[00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:37.671]  And I'm going to show you for TV viewers, that's why I started simulcasting my radio show more than 20 years ago on TV, because people wouldn't believe me when I just told them I had a document.
[00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:38.872]  So here I can show it to you.
[00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.286]  It's all linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:46.709]  We've got a link in the live show feed to the FDA document, to our articles that have the links.
[00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.751]  But if you look right here, if you're a TV viewer, you see this?
[00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:55.914]  That's the FDA document at FDA.gov.
[00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:56.774]  You see that right there?
[00:06:58.555 --> 00:07:07.880]  And this is the equivalent of reading the menu list for Zyklon B in the German death camps.
[00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.358]  Now, this is a very dangerous drug.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.082]  It's a very toxic drug.
[00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:24.788]  And I wondered why, two weeks ago, they suddenly authorized it for five and ups, and that was on the news.
[00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:44.112]   We said, oh look, because there's more heart attacks in children, they just authorized this toxic drug for when children have heart attacks and myocarditis, not knowing that they had just quietly slipped it in there That they're putting it as the quote base in the Pfizer shot.
[00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:56.557]  No longer is the Pfizer shot for children going to be in a saline salt solution like most drugs you inject, all vaccines, even the nasals in a saline solution.
[00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:08.736]   But a very toxic Heart attack drug that you only take when someone's dying of a heart attack because it has so many bad side effects.
[00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:19.040]  And the dose, I looked it up, is a very toxic, near fatal dose in children of the drug, which could actually make them have a heart attack.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:25.722]  I mean, folks, they might start putting cyanide in there on TV, and kids might start dropping dead by the thousands, and the news will say it's good.
[00:08:25.943 --> 00:08:27.703]  I mean, we're entering that territory.
[00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:28.944]  This is psycho...
[00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:35.365]  Behavioral psychologists running all this to just see how many of us they can kill and normalizing this.
[00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:36.505]  They're normalizing it.
[00:08:37.906 --> 00:08:45.067]  Because you know the Germans could argue they didn't know about death camps and things and Eisenhower made them go and do tours of it and look at it for themselves in famous film footage.
[00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:57.790]  But here we know it's a death camp, we know it's a slow kill, we know it stays in the body for 15 months at least and causes all sorts of cardiovascular problems from the vaccine.
[00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:04.566]  But now, they just go, oh, we're not going to have the Pfizer shot based on saline for children.
[00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:06.807]  It's going to be a heart attack drug.
[00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:10.248]  Wow!
[00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.769]  And then there's no coverage of it, except a legal notice.
[00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:16.170]  Oh, it's authorized in children now.
[00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.110]  Why not?
[00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.031]  They emergency authorized these mRNAs.
[00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:21.512]  Why not some heart attack medicine for your child?
[00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:27.474]  Holy Frankenstein!
[00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.173]  Now, when I started calling people about this last night, they thought I was joking.
[00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:35.414]  Prominent people.
[00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:37.715]  Saying, hey, you gotta see this.
[00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:45.740]  And when they saw that it was actually an empty website, they basically crapped themselves, and so did I. So I shot a report about it last night with Rob Due.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.440]  We were up here until 8.
[00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:48.882]  And I was pretty excited in the video.
[00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:49.702]  I saw complaints.
[00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:50.983]  I was interrupting Rob during it.
[00:09:51.203 --> 00:09:52.804]  Yeah, I'm upset they're killing kids.
[00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:54.065]  Yeah, I'm upset in the video.
[00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:55.886]  Why don't you worry about how they're killing kids?
[00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:58.163]  Or go to your own video exposing it.
[00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:01.306]  And my point is, is that we're in a damn war.
[00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:04.189]  Doesn't matter how my delivery is.
[00:10:04.409 --> 00:10:06.191]  In fact, I mean, I don't know.
[00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.433]  I just can't sit here on air and just talk about this.
[00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:11.636]  I'm not going to do anything violent like they're doing to our children because they'll use that against us.
[00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:14.159]  But they deserve to be held accountable.
[00:10:14.359 --> 00:10:15.861]  I mean, they are attacking us.
[00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:27.843]   You know, if a crazy man showed up at your house with a needle full of cyanide, Or a needle full of Drano and tried to inject you, you would have a right, you would have a duty to protect yourself and your children.
[00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:35.126]  And Fauci is this well-known crazy madman, but here's the thing, I'm going to get to this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:37.567]  That's just one thing here.
[00:10:37.587 --> 00:10:39.927]  This is over the top.
[00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:43.757]  The fact that no one even knows about it?
[00:10:43.937 --> 00:10:45.338]  The fact that it happened 12 days ago?
[00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:47.580]  The fact that it's all right here?
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.841]  The fact that it has all these horrible side effects?
[00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:58.387]  It says you must inject it into someone's vein to go directly into the heart, or it can kill someone!
[00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:01.349]  That's the main indication!
[00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:10.735]  I guess the contraindication is, you know, doing the opposite, and they say, inject it into the muscle of the child.
[00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:16.317]  And it says in the literature that will necrose the arm.
[00:11:16.698 --> 00:11:17.758]  It'll eat a hole in them.
[00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:19.840]  It liquefies you.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.042]  So this is designed to be injected into a vein.
[00:11:24.203 --> 00:11:25.403]  So it goes into the heart.
[00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:30.427]  That's the closest thing to the heart is a vein, because it's going into the heart to get oxygenated.
[00:11:30.747 --> 00:11:33.709]  It's supposed to go into a vein, not into an artery.
[00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.414]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not even a doctor, but I called doctors about this last night, and they didn't even know about this.
[00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.111]  I mean, wow!
[00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:45.431]  Whoa!
[00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:47.152]  Whoa!
[00:11:47.172 --> 00:11:52.293]  Whoa, whoa, whoa is you that goes along with this.
[00:11:53.853 --> 00:11:56.174]  They've made a psychotic attack on humanity.
[00:11:56.214 --> 00:11:57.635]  I mean, now it's totally confirmed.
[00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:01.316]  And remember what the FDA doctor said.
[00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:04.597]  He goes, I'm voting to approve this because we don't know what this is going to do.
[00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:06.257]  We have to test it on the general public.
[00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.070]  Tested on children.
[00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.171]  Yeah, don't go get a guinea pig or a rat, because they already did secret tests.
[00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:11.951]  They know what it does to them.
[00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.251]  It does them blood clots and kills them.
[00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:15.011]  So let's just do it to the children.
[00:12:15.031 --> 00:12:26.774]  I mean, when you see these guys, these are psycho freaks, paid off by the system, on TV, literally killing children, and they're financing moves to shut us all down and ban us.
[00:12:26.814 --> 00:12:30.634]  And the head of Pfizer says he wants everybody criticizing him arrested.
[00:12:30.654 --> 00:12:34.315]  Okay, I'm gonna cover all this.
[00:12:35.402 --> 00:12:40.386]  And then show you the actual FDA document right here in my hand, at the bottom of the hour, okay?
[00:12:41.787 --> 00:12:45.811]  And all the side effects and everything else, tell everybody you know, friends, family, tell them to tune in.
[00:12:47.812 --> 00:12:58.000]  And now we've got the former head of Planned Parenthood, who wants to, I guess, kill kids after they're out of the womb, saying, yeah, with the Anderson Cooper, it's okay, you get a 15 times increase in myocarditis and heart attacks, that's no big deal.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.003]  And they're on TV like, it's no big deal, 15 time increase in heart attacks.
[00:13:02.017 --> 00:13:02.437]  No big deal.
[00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:03.698]  Just gaslighting.
[00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:04.559]  Well, it's no big deal.
[00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:06.480]  15 time increase in this.
[00:13:08.562 --> 00:13:14.186]  Oh, but they just are banning these vaccines, these deadly injections all over the world, including Europe, Germany.
[00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:18.549]  But, but, oh, you're, but see, America is targeted for total destruction.
[00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.211]  And then here's the rest of it.
[00:13:22.032 --> 00:13:23.093]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:13:23.993 --> 00:13:24.794]  We have the video of this.
[00:13:24.854 --> 00:13:25.354]  It's chilling.
[00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:30.138]  Australian leader says lockdown for the vaccinated is likely.
[00:13:31.952 --> 00:13:33.292]  It's the Australian Chancellor.
[00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:34.693]  That's the leader of their parliament.
[00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:41.435]  And said that we will lock you in your house and then once you go bankrupt, we will then take you to a camp.
[00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:42.895]  Actually says camps.
[00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:43.896]  All happening.
[00:13:46.256 --> 00:13:48.597]  Germany hits record new COVID cases in 24 hours.
[00:13:48.677 --> 00:13:51.538]  Even though they're totally locked down.
[00:13:51.618 --> 00:13:54.579]  Germany and France restrict Moderna COVID vaccine for under 30s.
[00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.299]  Over rare heart risk.
[00:13:57.339 --> 00:13:58.299]  Yeah, it's not rare.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.780]  Taiwan halts second dose of Pfizer after deaths and heart attacks in young people.
[00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:06.441]  Oh, yeah, that's out of the news over there.
[00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:11.362]  But you won't be hearing that anywhere on our news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:14.642]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:14.742 --> 00:14:18.303]  It gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[00:14:18.323 --> 00:14:20.884]  And then I've got Klaus Schwab's new announcement.
[00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:23.344]  Oh, he's got a new initiative.
[00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:25.998]  You heard of Bill Backbetter and the Great Reset?
[00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:32.983]  Well, he's set to announce tomorrow, we're going to cover it live, during the show, something new for you.
[00:14:33.383 --> 00:14:38.707]  And as soon as he says it, you'll see every globalist and every leftist parrot it like an obedient parrot.
[00:14:40.688 --> 00:14:42.790]  And we happen to know what he's going to announce tomorrow.
[00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.551]  So you want tomorrow's news today?
[00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:46.853]  You'll get that too, in this hour.
[00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:54.598]  You might want to call your friends and family and tell them to tune in, or you can just let them murder you and your family, because they did say they're going to murder you.
[00:14:54.758 --> 00:14:55.499]  You know that, right?
[00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:56.520]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:58.081 --> 00:15:03.185]  All right, my friends, let's go back 10 months ago.
[00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:07.888]  When I was ranting and raving on air.
[00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:12.012]  About what we would be living under very soon in the Great Reset.
[00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:24.525]  And the fact that the global lockdown was just beginning, not ending, as they now announce in Europe, Australia, Canada, more lockdowns, including permanent lockdowns of those that are, quote, unvaccinated.
[00:15:24.545 --> 00:15:28.206]  And if they catch any friends or family visiting, you'll be taken to a camp.
[00:15:28.226 --> 00:15:31.207]  That's how they make it sound reasonable.
[00:15:31.307 --> 00:15:33.568]  Oh, you won't go to the camp unless you have visitors.
[00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.529]  Oh, but once you don't have a job, we're going to take your house.
[00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.350]  So you'll have to live in a camp.
[00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:41.148]  This is being announced by the Associated Press.
[00:15:41.428 --> 00:15:45.509]  There's video of the head of their parliament, their chancellor, saying it in Australia.
[00:15:46.089 --> 00:15:47.229]  That's all UN run.
[00:15:47.609 --> 00:15:48.910]  This is the system they're bringing here.
[00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.710]  It's all from the UN.
[00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:56.031]  And then I've got just incredible news here.
[00:15:58.331 --> 00:16:00.912]  Dealing with this, but look at this headline on Infowars.com.
[00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:05.653]  Germany latest EU government to warn young adults, pregnant women to avoid the Moderna jab.
[00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:14.307]   The Moderna jab Works exactly the same as the Pfizer shot.
[00:16:14.387 --> 00:16:16.108]  It's the same thing I've had scientists on.
[00:16:16.148 --> 00:16:19.990]  I've read the literature myself, except it's three times stronger.
[00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:26.253]  Remember Bill Gates said like 20 months ago, we'll have a new vaccine, but it's got to be really strong.
[00:16:26.553 --> 00:16:29.855]  So yeah, 80% do, you know, have bad reactions.
[00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:30.555]  Remember on NBC?
[00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.076]  I'm not going to play it again.
[00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.156]  I've probably played it a hundred times.
[00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:34.377]  Seriously.
[00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:36.278]  Yeah.
[00:16:36.438 --> 00:16:36.558]  Yeah.
[00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:40.688]   The Moderna is Super bad news.
[00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:43.049]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:45.350]  That's the good cop, bad cop.
[00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.970]  Okay, people are getting sick.
[00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.790]  We'll stop having the Moderna one.
[00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.631]  Here, you can take this one, but there'll be lots of booster shots that do the same damn thing.
[00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:57.333]  Oh, I got big news out of Israel, too.
[00:16:57.713 --> 00:16:57.893]  They're...
[00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:01.950]  Everything you see in Australia and Israel is what's coming here next.
[00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.651]  That's why it's so important.
[00:17:03.972 --> 00:17:08.316]  They've now announced that they're preparing for total permanent martial law for the next variant.
[00:17:08.336 --> 00:17:12.059]  They're saying COVID's permanent and there'll be a sixth shot.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.601]  A sixth shot.
[00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:15.763]  And oh, it's going to be reformulated.
[00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:18.325]  Oh, so the five shots don't work.
[00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:20.567]  Then the six shots, a new variant.
[00:17:21.088 --> 00:17:22.629]  Oh, and then you'll need five or six more shots.
[00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:24.391]  And then it just continues on forever.
[00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:28.078]  They're holding war games on how to make you do it.
[00:17:28.258 --> 00:17:29.119]  That's all coming up.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.747]  But first, here I am 10 months ago, because this is going viral again, and it's important.
[00:17:33.767 --> 00:17:35.590]  It sounds very negative, but it's really what's happening.
[00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.135]  And only admitting that this is happening gives us any chance of turning this around.
[00:17:39.356 --> 00:17:39.716]  Here it is.
[00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.857]  I mean, you understand, folks, I believe they're going to shut everything down in the next few months.
[00:17:43.877 --> 00:17:45.298]  They're going to blow up federal buildings.
[00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:47.880]  They're going to put poison in water supplies.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.640]  I mean, it's over.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.481]  I mean, it's over.
[00:17:50.622 --> 00:17:51.122]  You understand?
[00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:53.904]  Your only shot you've got is realizing that we're screwed.
[00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:56.085]  Your candy-ass church isn't going to do it.
[00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:57.846]  Your candy-ass boss isn't going to do it.
[00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:00.688]  We're a trained group of monkeys in this country.
[00:18:01.228 --> 00:18:02.609]  We're not what Americans used to be.
[00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:04.170]  We're not rugged individualists.
[00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.352]  We don't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:07.873]  We're a joke, okay?
[00:18:09.013 --> 00:18:14.296]  And so they got people like Brian Stelter up there saying shut down all of his competition on TV now.
[00:18:15.516 --> 00:18:16.677]  He thinks he owns you.
[00:18:17.317 --> 00:18:18.718]  Jeff Zucker thinks he owns you.
[00:18:18.938 --> 00:18:20.539]  These are bad people, okay?
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.121]  So I've done the best job I can.
[00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:25.902]  I'm not bitching at the crew or you or anybody.
[00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:35.007]  I'm just saying it's hard for me to get up here and do a normal show when we have a group of corporate criminals literally gang raping us.
[00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:41.681]  I mean, if we ever beat this thing, it'll be in the history of, like, these people were Hitler.
[00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:44.043]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:18:44.303 --> 00:18:47.466]  It's not like, oh, we're getting there, it's bad, things are out of control.
[00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:49.788]  It's, it's, they've just begun.
[00:18:50.268 --> 00:18:55.973]  They're going to take your pension funds, they're going to bankrupt, they're going to cut the power off, the oil off, they're going to open the borders.
[00:18:56.153 --> 00:18:57.154]  It's over, man.
[00:18:57.455 --> 00:18:57.975]  It's over.
[00:18:58.055 --> 00:18:58.876]  It's all gone.
[00:18:59.136 --> 00:18:59.877]  It's all over.
[00:19:00.197 --> 00:19:03.978]  They're going to activate the Boogaloos, FBI, ADL, terror forces.
[00:19:04.158 --> 00:19:05.738]  They're going to start blowing everything up.
[00:19:05.918 --> 00:19:07.659]  Then they're going to come arrest all the patriots.
[00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:08.879]  The idiots will cheer it.
[00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:10.599]  Then they're going to shut your power off.
[00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:12.419]  They want you starving in the street.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.700]  They want to rape your wife.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.800]  They're Bolsheviks!
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.020]  They're Jacobins!
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.441]  It's all over, man!
[00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:19.401]  All over!
[00:19:19.661 --> 00:19:20.381]  Enjoy!
[00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.101]  All your games!
[00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.322]  In fact, America is rotting and deserves it.
[00:19:24.682 --> 00:19:27.262]  Now, the Satanists aren't good.
[00:19:27.282 --> 00:19:28.023]  They're not God.
[00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.543]  God just lets them have their way now.
[00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.109]  So all your games are over!
[00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.991]  All the TV watching, all the laziness, all the slack-jawing's over!
[00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:38.271]  It's over!
[00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:43.013]  You're gonna be just like a baby at six months being chopped up in its mother's womb!
[00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:46.454]  You're not a human, you're not essential, you're dead!
[00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:49.215]  They're gonna kill you, cause you don't care!
[00:19:51.555 --> 00:19:53.916]  And that's where they'd like to take you if you put up with it.
[00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:55.551]  And they intend to do it by increment.
[00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.772]  So here's the new article from RT.
[00:19:56.812 --> 00:19:57.952]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:03.475]  DHS claims COVID restrictions and arrival of Afghans could fuel domestic terror.
[00:20:04.935 --> 00:20:11.958]  You see, that's the official terror policy is that anti-vaxxers are terrorists and are going to start blowing things up.
[00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:18.161]  They said that when he got into office by fraud in January in their first press conference with Jane Psaki.
[00:20:19.241 --> 00:20:22.843]  And then they said it again with the top generals at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:20:23.499 --> 00:20:24.800]  For the first time ever in U.S.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.441]  history, denouncing that they're prepared for war with the American people.
[00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:28.781]  Totally illegal.
[00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:35.064]  Then, in June, they changed the law and he issued the executive orders.
[00:20:37.324 --> 00:20:42.187]  They say the American people are the main terror threat for not wanting lockdowns and or questioning the election.
[00:20:42.727 --> 00:20:43.348]  And here it is.
[00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:52.053]  DHS claims COVID restrictions and arrival of Afghans could fuel domestic terrorism because they know the Islamists, they brought in a bunch of Islamists, they know they'll probably blow something up.
[00:20:52.393 --> 00:20:53.674]  So they're kind of mixing that in there.
[00:20:53.714 --> 00:20:59.237]  But oh, but the main threat is, you know, the Alex Jones is the world because you heard the head of Pfizer two days ago.
[00:21:00.825 --> 00:21:08.853]  He said, oh my gosh, I'm talking to the FBI and CIA, and there's these dark actors that are lying to people about the shots, and they're bad, and we gotta get them, and they need to be arrested.
[00:21:09.193 --> 00:21:09.914]  They're criminals.
[00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:13.057]  He said, they're criminals, yes.
[00:21:13.137 --> 00:21:14.178]  No, you're the criminal.
[00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:15.619]  You're the criminal.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:25.669]  You paid off the politicians and bought up the health departments of the West and put this poison on us that you know damn well destroys the immune system and causes all these heart attacks, and you will be brought to justice.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.518]  But you know that if there's a bombing or a mass shooting at a vaccine facility or an attack on one of these guys or Fauci, 99% chance they did it.
[00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:40.160]  And then they're going to blame it on us, because that's how they operate.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.741]  That's the next thing they're going to do.
[00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:46.403]  And they're so pissed that Tucker Carlson exposed January 6th as an inside job.
[00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:49.645]  They're so mad that we're getting people to think about this and know what's coming.
[00:21:49.805 --> 00:21:54.327]  You know, I told you a year and a half ago they're going to stage terror attacks on the anti-vaxxers under martial law.
[00:21:54.548 --> 00:21:55.048]  Of course they are.
[00:21:55.088 --> 00:21:55.708]  That's the plan.
[00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:56.749]  We're the insurgents.
[00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:57.489]  We don't want to die.
[00:21:57.869 --> 00:22:01.011]  We don't want to get shot with the poison, so we get shot with the bullets.
[00:22:02.426 --> 00:22:03.727]  This is very, very simple.
[00:22:03.747 --> 00:22:06.048]  This has been done in Africa, and Latin America, and Asia.
[00:22:06.389 --> 00:22:09.250]  They come in and inject people, and a year later, half the village is dead.
[00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.132]  The next time, people run when they see the UN trucks coming.
[00:22:13.073 --> 00:22:13.853]  Run by Tedris.
[00:22:14.814 --> 00:22:16.815]  Then they use helicopters and just take them out.
[00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:24.320]  They even have New York Times articles about, oh, these villagers wouldn't turn on their land to a carbon sink and did not follow the UN directive, so 10,000 were killed by UN forces.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.741]  It's just footnote.
[00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:27.422]  Just line them up, shoot them.
[00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:30.338]  Then as that collapses, they all run and flee here.
[00:22:30.638 --> 00:22:38.464]  Soros gives them a $3,000 debit card, and literally, there's now like 5 million refugees from the Caribbean and Africa already in the U.S.
[00:22:38.484 --> 00:22:39.605]  in the first 10 months of this year.
[00:22:39.965 --> 00:22:40.506]  Oh yeah, folks.
[00:22:40.766 --> 00:22:45.790]  The Border Patrol real numbers are, as of October, 10 million people already got into the U.S.
[00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.551]  It wasn't 2 million or 3 million.
[00:22:47.571 --> 00:22:48.172]  10 million!
[00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:51.357]  10 million.
[00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:53.098]  And the UN says that's just the start.
[00:22:53.318 --> 00:23:00.764]  By 2050, 640 million people are going to be brought here as, quote, replacement migration from the third world.
[00:23:01.225 --> 00:23:05.008]  Exporting the third world here to capture us under UN control.
[00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:07.009]  And where are the governors?
[00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:08.110]  Where are the legislatures?
[00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.392]  Where are the leaders telling you you're in a war under the Great Reset?
[00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:14.795]  I'll tell you about it when we come back.
[00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:30.359]   But first, I'm going to hit The very extreme, poisonous, only-use-in-emergency, only-break-glass-when-someone's-having-a-horrible-heart-attack drug being added with no fanfare or coverage to the children's Pfizer shots.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.420]  That's right.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:31.981]  Stay with us.
[00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:34.062]  All right, my friends.
[00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:48.185]   Remember, the British Medical Journal came out two weeks ago and said they looked at data from the whistleblower that had worked in the Pfizer Trials that have been going on with the rollout in the last year in the U.S.
[00:23:48.225 --> 00:23:48.905]  here in Texas.
[00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:53.287]  And that indeed they had suppressed illnesses and death.
[00:23:53.887 --> 00:23:56.168]  That is back in the news today.
[00:23:56.808 --> 00:23:59.629]  There's more from the British Medical Journal on that.
[00:23:59.669 --> 00:24:00.509]  We'll be getting to it.
[00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:10.133]  So if you just tuned in, I'm begging you to understand that the enemy is suppressing all this information across big tech.
[00:24:10.862 --> 00:24:13.143]  No one's talking about this on Mainline Talk Radio.
[00:24:13.843 --> 00:24:26.146]  Our job here at InfoWars, your job, if you care, and I know you do, is to force this information out and to punch a hole through the electronic Berlin Wall, the iron curtain of censorship.
[00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:33.728]  You have to, like a laser beam, help me, help yourself, help all of us get this out.
[00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:48.560]   And the power of the millions of people listening, Live right now or later, this will be archived at Man.Video, to take this information and to share it with everyone you know and to call people up and say, hey, I'm going to send you this via email or I'm going to text this to you.
[00:24:49.061 --> 00:24:50.282]  You need to watch this.
[00:24:52.083 --> 00:25:00.990]  And all the great viewers and people, you need to take these live shows and edit them and take clips out and take the best parts you think and put them on Twitter, put them on Facebook, put them on Instagram.
[00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:03.132]  Who cares if you get censored or banned?
[00:25:03.532 --> 00:25:04.233]  This is war.
[00:25:05.374 --> 00:25:06.555]  And they can't stop everybody.
[00:25:09.668 --> 00:25:11.648]  Bottom line, you've got to take the live show feed.
[00:25:11.668 --> 00:25:12.569]  You've got to take the archive.
[00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:16.609]  You can share those via email and text message or word of mouth or call your employees in at lunch.
[00:25:17.129 --> 00:25:21.930]  If you're the boss and say, listen, here's the report on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.491]  A lot of you probably heard InfoWars.com has been demonized.
[00:25:24.911 --> 00:25:29.372]  That's because the bad guys want to silence the information's there, but this is real information.
[00:25:30.792 --> 00:25:31.732]  And again, I don't care.
[00:25:31.832 --> 00:25:34.132]  Other news people, other folks, we don't want credit.
[00:25:34.212 --> 00:25:37.633]  We don't care about who got it out there and got people covering it.
[00:25:39.133 --> 00:26:01.210]  The fact that I didn't know about this for 12 days, and that it was reported on a few little sites, and that some of my crew knew about it a week ago, and I wasn't even told, shows they're getting us right where they want us, where we're so used to being assaulted, so used to being attacked, that when the British Medical Journal confirms massive increases in heart attacks and massive increases in blood clots, it just isn't even a news item.
[00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:10.184]   Or the fact that they are criminally adding a very dangerous heart attack drug To the shots, and you're not even supposed to put it into muscle.
[00:26:11.245 --> 00:26:12.185]  It was just insane.
[00:26:12.806 --> 00:26:23.930]  And then, notice a year ago they said, oh, you gotta keep the Pfizer shot and the Moderna shot cool for this mRNA to not get broken down by heat.
[00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.591]  But notice they don't say you gotta keep it cool now.
[00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:32.654]  Because they're now adding a chemical to it that's extremely poisonous that lets it stay in stasis.
[00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:37.420]   I mean, ladies and gentlemen, This is just insane.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.381]  I mean, this is not a 5-10 year approval of some drug.
[00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:53.668]  This is them just sticking in whatever they want, whenever they want, and the dam has broken, and you've got these boards that have decided that they've got the criminal cover of the media and the Justice Department to do this to everybody.
[00:26:56.477 --> 00:26:58.819]  And of course I know why that's all happening, Klaus Schwab.
[00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:17.113]  They know this is going to discredit the US government, it's going to destroy the FBI, it's going to destroy the FDA, it's going to destroy the CDC, it's going to destroy the Justice Department and everything else, and the country will have a social contract that's broken, and the media will then blame America, and we're done.
[00:27:18.494 --> 00:27:33.529]   Instead of blaming Klaus Schwab and the UN and their operatives inside the government, Klaus Schwab Bill Gates, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller before him, Soros, Fauci.
[00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.850]  So this is so incredible.
[00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:47.994]  The drug is thromethamine, and I don't ask you, I order you, if you care about yourself and your family, to go look up this for yourself and read it, okay?
[00:27:49.394 --> 00:27:55.527]   And then I want you to read the side effects and the recommendations and the Counter-recommendations.
[00:27:55.627 --> 00:27:57.509]  It says never inject it into muscle.
[00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:01.952]  They say inject it into the muscle.
[00:28:04.455 --> 00:28:11.140]  They say the amount that's supposed to be given and the amount in the shot is way more than a child even having a heart attack would take.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.285]  I mean, this is so evil that it's mind-blowing.
[00:28:17.766 --> 00:28:18.566]  And then it gets worse.
[00:28:19.968 --> 00:28:22.710]  Notice now, again, they say they can keep the shot.
[00:28:23.846 --> 00:28:25.807]  In warmer temperature, and they don't tell you why.
[00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:27.507]  Well, we know why now.
[00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:32.168]  We got a double piece of information for you right now.
[00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:37.349]  Remember in October, the FDA and CDC knew that all this was going to happen, and it did.
[00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.290]  It's like if I loaded a gun and put it to your head and pull the trigger, I know it's going to shoot a bullet in your brain and probably kill you.
[00:28:42.831 --> 00:28:44.191]  Certainly, you're going to be hurt bad.
[00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:48.312]  Well, they knew, and they loaded the gun, and they stuck it to our head, and they pulled the damn trigger.
[00:28:49.412 --> 00:28:50.312]  And they even make jokes.
[00:28:50.332 --> 00:28:53.213]  They're so crazy, like, well, we got to give it to the kids and see what it does to them.
[00:28:55.353 --> 00:28:56.054]  So, here it is.
[00:28:56.234 --> 00:29:00.036]  It is thromethamine.
[00:29:00.437 --> 00:29:04.420]  T-R-O-M-E-T-H-A-M-I-N-E.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.401]  If you're driving down the road, listening.
[00:29:07.722 --> 00:29:09.123]  And here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:12.245]  Here is the FDA announcement, October 26.
[00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:16.789]  It didn't get published until a few days after, so about 12 days ago.
[00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:19.791]  This is when they said, we're going to inject the children.
[00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:34.172]  A few days before Halloween, they finally made the announcement on October 30th, FDA briefing document, EUA amendment request, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in children 5 to 11 years of age.
[00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:37.674]  And let me turn to the page for you.
[00:29:38.634 --> 00:29:39.735]  You got to read the whole document.
[00:29:40.055 --> 00:29:40.775]  This is on page 14.
[00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:46.958]  And by the way, you try to put this out on Twitter or Facebook, they take it down.
[00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:49.820]  Disinformation is reading directly from the document.
[00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:54.135]  To provide a vaccine with an improved stability profile.
[00:29:54.675 --> 00:29:55.716]  They say they do this for stability.
[00:29:56.156 --> 00:30:04.339]  The Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in children 5 to 11 years of age uses the drug right there.
[00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:07.520]  The same drug we just told you about.
[00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:10.241]  Thromethamine.
[00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:11.342]  Right there.
[00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:12.222]  Thromethamine.
[00:30:13.803 --> 00:30:17.604]  Buffer instead of the phosphate buffered saline.
[00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:20.551]  He wants us to use cyanide.
[00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:31.885]  As used in the previous formulation, and excludes sodium chloride and potassium chloride, the packaging vial for the new formulation are stored frozen.
[00:30:31.905 --> 00:30:33.448]  And then it goes on.
[00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:35.050]  So.
[00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:41.297]  I just read to you that you can go on my website, InfoWars.com, and link through.
[00:30:41.317 --> 00:30:48.359]  You'll be on the FDA.gov, and you will read that they don't put the regular saline solution that's in all the vaccines for 100 years.
[00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:57.982]  They put a toxic, very dangerous heart attack drug in it for children at a large dose.
[00:30:58.902 --> 00:31:02.183]  And it says, do not inject it into muscle.
[00:31:02.663 --> 00:31:05.004]  It will necrose the tissue.
[00:31:05.044 --> 00:31:05.884]  That means kill it.
[00:31:08.562 --> 00:31:09.243]  My God!
[00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:17.049]  I mean, we, let me tell you, I've been on here 28 years, nothing's came even half as close to this.
[00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:42.224]   The closest thing was learning three years ago that over a million children, 30,000 per major city, Plus, were delivered to child rapists, taken from Christian homes, ages 2 to 7, and given to rapists through a CIA program running the German, West German government, later East Germany, to quote, create the new system of love, a man and a boy or girl having sex.
[00:31:42.465 --> 00:31:43.145]  This is official.
[00:31:43.545 --> 00:31:44.405]  Run by the German government.
[00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:50.946]  Told you about it years ago, this year it was in New Yorker Magazine.
[00:31:50.966 --> 00:31:56.039]   I mean, I thought that was the, you know, like that was the, I mean, That's horrible, okay?
[00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:57.200]  But a lot of those children lived.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.561]  And that was just one article in DW.
[00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:04.064]  One city, 30,000 children, given by the CPS and then the judges.
[00:32:05.485 --> 00:32:05.905]  Oh, yeah.
[00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:10.468]  I mean, when you wonder why these family court judges are so absolutely deranged and out of control.
[00:32:10.488 --> 00:32:12.750]  Pedophiles.
[00:32:14.271 --> 00:32:14.711]  Pedophiles.
[00:32:15.091 --> 00:32:15.832]  Large percentage.
[00:32:17.613 --> 00:32:18.374]  So, there you go.
[00:32:18.614 --> 00:32:19.554]  Ha, yeah.
[00:32:20.295 --> 00:32:21.736]  That's exactly how they operate.
[00:32:24.406 --> 00:32:26.868]  Might want to investigate that a little further, I think we will be.
[00:32:27.428 --> 00:32:33.833]  But the point here is, is that when you wonder why they're against your free speech, or you wonder why they're for tyranny, they're in a cult of screwing children.
[00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:37.636]  So, and they don't want to just screw them with their diseased penises.
[00:32:38.497 --> 00:32:38.677]  No.
[00:32:39.198 --> 00:32:46.924]  They want to do it, ladies and gentlemen, with a deadly needle filled with heart attack medication and a system that makes them have blood clots.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.601]  And I was thinking maybe they want to stop them having a heart attack.
[00:32:50.641 --> 00:32:51.082]  No, no, no.
[00:32:51.162 --> 00:32:54.304]  It says in here it'll make you have a heart attack if it's not done right.
[00:32:54.744 --> 00:32:56.685]  They're actually trying to make children have heart attacks.
[00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.787]  They are murdering criminals.
[00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:01.789]  And I'll probably get assassinated for telling you about it.
[00:33:02.709 --> 00:33:04.631]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:05.131 --> 00:33:05.751]  to 3 p.m.
[00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:06.172]  Central.
[00:33:06.372 --> 00:33:08.353]  It is the dreaded Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.814 --> 00:33:11.215]  Dreaded by pedophiles.
[00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:13.236]  Hated by Satanists.
[00:33:14.456 --> 00:33:18.456]  Feared by tyrants and control freaks everywhere.
[00:33:18.456 --> 00:33:23.256]  Standing firm and strong in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:23.256 --> 00:33:29.496]  Trusting only in the grace and direction of God.
[00:33:29.778 --> 00:33:30.398]  I am your host.
[00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:36.082]  And I did say going to break that down this road, they will probably kill me.
[00:33:37.463 --> 00:33:39.465]  And I don't look forward to that.
[00:33:39.505 --> 00:33:40.245]  I don't like that.
[00:33:40.265 --> 00:33:41.246]  I don't want to be a martyr.
[00:33:42.006 --> 00:33:47.430]  But I don't need to be a rocket scientist to be able to extrapolate this out for everybody.
[00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:53.995]  They're going after the children worldwide with poison shots, adding whatever the hell they want.
[00:33:54.736 --> 00:34:02.638]  With no news coverage, against even FDA approval of what you can use these drugs for, and not even telling people.
[00:34:02.798 --> 00:34:04.459]  There's nothing on the inserts of the packages.
[00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:08.920]  And they cover their ass, they think, by just posting it.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.661]  I mean, this is a level of criminality that is mind-blowing.
[00:34:12.881 --> 00:34:20.670]   And then I see all over the news, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, People protesting the mandate are gonna blow stuff up!
[00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.652]  Why Aaron Rodgers is the worst man on Earth!
[00:34:24.072 --> 00:34:25.473]  He should lose his job!
[00:34:25.853 --> 00:34:27.795]  He should be... He didn't take the shot!
[00:34:28.516 --> 00:34:31.378]  Matthew McConaughey won't give his three children the injections?
[00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:36.842]  You see how this works?
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.541]  Yeah, it doesn't make you a superpower, folks.
[00:34:40.581 --> 00:34:44.002]  It gives you chronic illness and lowers your immunity.
[00:34:44.262 --> 00:34:46.942]  Not where, oh, it's 35% effective or it's 10% effective.
[00:34:46.982 --> 00:34:52.324]  No, no, they're now reporting and confirming, oh, six months after the Pfizer shots, you have a negative immunity.
[00:34:52.964 --> 00:34:54.485]  Negative to what you had previous to it.
[00:34:55.605 --> 00:34:57.085]  Oh, and you get sicker from the shot.
[00:34:57.486 --> 00:35:09.563]   But if you want to leave your house in Canada or Europe or Australia, I mean, if you still try to go outside your house in Germany, They beat you over the head with clubs and police dogs.
[00:35:11.304 --> 00:35:12.544]  Oh, and they have the highest COVID levels.
[00:35:12.624 --> 00:35:13.505]  And look at this.
[00:35:14.845 --> 00:35:17.507]  This is out of Scientific American.
[00:35:21.649 --> 00:35:39.785]   19 months after we did reports on it from MIT videos, from PBS and Rice University videos, Saying, thank you Bill and Melinda Gates for funding these digital tattoos that put micro glass into the skin to let us know you've been vaccinated while it delivers the vaccine at the same time.
[00:35:40.285 --> 00:35:44.186]  Now, they announce it this year.
[00:35:44.206 --> 00:35:47.787]  Remember they had all the fact checkers say Jones is wrong, it's not true, it's fake.
[00:35:48.127 --> 00:35:52.888]  Bill Gates went on TV and said nobody wants to put little tracker chips in you.
[00:35:52.908 --> 00:35:54.609]  And he said that with his wife.
[00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:56.022]  And here it is.
[00:35:56.422 --> 00:35:59.727]  Invisible ink could reveal whether kids have been vaccinated.
[00:35:59.767 --> 00:36:00.969]  And oh, look at the picture they show.
[00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:02.812]  It's a new definition.
[00:36:02.852 --> 00:36:03.953]  It's not invisible ink.
[00:36:04.655 --> 00:36:07.479]  It shows the strip with spikes on it.
[00:36:09.525 --> 00:36:20.133]  Now, they're only a tenth of a millimeter long, but they work their nanotech into your body and have the, quote, vaccine and little tracker numbers that can be read by a reader.
[00:36:20.433 --> 00:36:25.416]  Oh, remember what Peter Daszak and Fauci in 2017 came to the Pentagon and wanted to do?
[00:36:26.457 --> 00:36:34.523]  They said, we want to spray nanotech with this coronavirus hybrid in it that was COVID-19 on the batch.
[00:36:35.782 --> 00:36:43.969]  So we had MIT, we had all the documents, and they just came out and said, remember, fact-checkers, Bill Gates isn't putting chips in the vaccine.
[00:36:44.009 --> 00:36:45.891]  No, no, he's just building it and proposing it.
[00:36:46.151 --> 00:36:54.458]  And yesterday the UN came out and said, we want to give people systems with patches that deliver it and nasal systems that put nanotech into your body.
[00:36:55.619 --> 00:37:01.624]  Remember the Davos group two weeks ago said, oh, we're going to start spraying the food supplies with nanotech for your safety.
[00:37:01.824 --> 00:37:02.404]  Oh, of course.
[00:37:02.925 --> 00:37:07.432]   And then a few days later, The USDA.
[00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:10.916]  The USDA.
[00:37:10.996 --> 00:37:12.117]  Oh, the crew just found that.
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:13.278]  Put that back up.
[00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:23.928]  The USDA came out and said, oh, a week after, as soon as Klaus Schwab says something, that's when they, yep, we're now approving outside of law, we're just doing it.
[00:37:24.288 --> 00:37:29.774]  We have that discretion with our board to start spraying your food with nanotech that we can then read inside your body.
[00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:34.931]  I mean, that's 10 times crazier than 5G giving you cancer, which they admit!
[00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:46.897]  I mean, now it says, we're gonna track you with radioactive isotopes that'll go to your brain and your tissues so you can never escape us and we can look at the history of what you've been eating and what you've been doing and your carbon footprint, like we're all lab rats.
[00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:47.577]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:37:48.677 --> 00:37:54.440]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and they said, hey, we have a real problem knowing who's vaccinated.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.580]   So our idea was to put The record on the person.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.941]  Oh, on him, you mean in him.
[00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:02.002]  And then it's an image of spikes going into your body.
[00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:07.645]  Here it is, on a scientific American, the spikes we showed you over a year and a half ago.
[00:38:09.426 --> 00:38:13.348]  But, oh, NewsGuard came out and said we were lying.
[00:38:13.368 --> 00:38:16.590]  Of course, it even said at the bottom of the NewsGuard article, paid for by Microsoft.
[00:38:18.491 --> 00:38:19.952]  NewsGuard's run by Microsoft.
[00:38:21.893 --> 00:38:32.723]   So now, throw methamine Is being put in these children, and did they put it in there because they think it'll stop them having a heart attack from the shot?
[00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:39.446]  Did they even look and go, oh, this will cause necrosis and death in the tissue it's injected in.
[00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:40.467]  You can't inject it into muscle.
[00:38:40.647 --> 00:38:41.587]  It's got to be put into a vein.
[00:38:41.928 --> 00:38:42.768]  Oh, it's very toxic.
[00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:43.188]  Oh, that's all.
[00:38:43.228 --> 00:38:45.189]  No, there's not even a discussion about that.
[00:38:45.509 --> 00:38:50.272]  There's just, oh, a little footnote of the minutes of the FDA.
[00:38:50.312 --> 00:38:50.792]  Here it is.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:39:03.002]  And I love how national media calls me, Washington Post, New York Times, you know, just, and they call me and sometimes I don't know who it is and I answer and they go, they start giggling and saying, oh, you better defend yourself.
[00:39:03.242 --> 00:39:04.662]  Boy, you're really getting torn up.
[00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:05.943]  Why don't you talk to us?
[00:39:06.003 --> 00:39:09.583]  And I tell them, I say, do you have any children?
[00:39:09.763 --> 00:39:11.124]  You know, they're coming to kill them, right?
[00:39:11.404 --> 00:39:16.385]  You think I give a damn about you suing me or attacking me or any of this?
[00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:20.186]  When you people have signed on to the globalist murdering everyone?
[00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:22.046]  You psycho crazy people!
[00:39:24.588 --> 00:39:30.210]  I mean, they think they're getting to me, lying about me everywhere, and sending white supremacists to try to get it.
[00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.710]  I mean, you people are nuts.
[00:39:32.571 --> 00:39:33.551]  You people are demonic.
[00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:34.231]  You're crazy.
[00:39:35.552 --> 00:39:36.292]  You're crazy!
[00:39:37.592 --> 00:39:45.815]  And you look at me, a normal person that does research and cares, and doesn't want toxic waste and poison forced on us by a bunch of eugenicists that say they want to depopulate us.
[00:39:46.035 --> 00:39:47.696]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all of them.
[00:39:48.296 --> 00:39:51.217]  And now they're running our medical system, and of course it's killing us!
[00:39:52.008 --> 00:39:53.449]  And you've got Stockholm Syndrome, though.
[00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:55.790]  You can't admit it's happening, or you're part of it.
[00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:00.692]  What they are is Arrested Development, low IQ children.
[00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:06.174]  They're playing along and pretending that they're even alive.
[00:40:06.234 --> 00:40:11.756]  They're living in a facsimile programmed and created to them in a lifetime of watching TV and being on the Internet.
[00:40:14.617 --> 00:40:17.638]  It's called Fantasyland, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:17.658 --> 00:40:18.659]  That's where these people live.
[00:40:19.835 --> 00:40:40.522]  And then there's this whole other area that, you know, this other whole area is so incredible and so insane that I'm going to cover it in the third hour because I got a bunch of other documents and I want to read over them and everything and get these studies and highlight it for you.
[00:40:41.643 --> 00:40:47.225]  But they are putting an extremely toxic chemical in the Pfizer shots now.
[00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:49.860]  Not the heart attack drug, that too.
[00:40:50.801 --> 00:40:55.644]  That stabilizes it in a higher temperature that they say will kill mammals.
[00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:00.968]  Says that do not use in any mammal tissue, it will kill mammals.
[00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:03.329]  Do not give to mammals.
[00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.050]  Give to mammals.
[00:41:07.852 --> 00:41:11.034]  It's like in the other story, the rat poison says do not consume.
[00:41:11.515 --> 00:41:12.735]  Not for human consumption.
[00:41:12.976 --> 00:41:14.857]  Poison, skull and crossbones.
[00:41:15.726 --> 00:41:17.347]  And it's just being done to us.
[00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:18.748]  So there you go.
[00:41:18.808 --> 00:41:22.971]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you've only got four days left to get score-wide free Chevy Double Patriot points.
[00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:28.575]  And when it's crazy as the world is, it can be your last chance anytime to get books, films, InfoWars t-shirts.
[00:41:28.595 --> 00:41:35.860]  So that's going to be, I think, pretty collectible in the future during the long years of martial law and combat robots and all the extermination we're going to have to go through.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.480]  We'll come out on the end of it.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.401]  I probably won't, but that's okay, as long as we plant the seeds of resistance.
[00:41:40.742 --> 00:41:50.905]  But I really would get your storable food now, and I really would get 60% off on Ultra 12, and I would get to the bone broth, the spaghet stock, and the Rainforest Plus.
[00:41:51.265 --> 00:41:55.827]  We're just trying to build our war chest up as much as we can to go into the future, and we're dug in as much as we can.
[00:41:56.866 --> 00:42:01.127]  You know, really, we're just worried about the children at this point, and it's really sad, the extermination operation going on.
[00:42:01.147 --> 00:42:07.188]  But if I were you, I would get all your orders in and get your Christmas shopping done right now, as if any of that even really matters.
[00:42:07.828 --> 00:42:12.750]  Seriously, though, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:23.512]  You see, they intend to use our normalcy bias against us, where we just want to keep doing our bureaucracy and keep having fun and, you know, keep having little parties and doing the little rituals and the rest of it.
[00:42:24.406 --> 00:42:38.145]  ...like Christmas and Thanksgiving, but then in the backdrop of that, the borders are collapsing, and the dollar's being devalued, and inflation's exploding, and the globalists are coming at us with poison shots, and the hospitals are full of people sick from the vaccines, got Staxon News admitting that, and...
[00:42:39.062 --> 00:42:42.286]  We had to break out of that normalcy bias and realize how much trouble we're in.
[00:42:42.586 --> 00:42:45.609]  So, yes, things are going to continue grinding on.
[00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:50.154]  It's just going to get more and more macabre, more and more dystopic, and people are just going to rationalize more and more.
[00:42:50.454 --> 00:42:55.735]   We have to shock them out of their normalcy bias to wake up literally spiritually and mentally
[00:42:55.735 --> 00:42:58.813]  and electromagnetically and understand what's happening.
[00:42:58.813 --> 00:43:03.094]   And then transcend these people by not complying with anything they say and exposing them.
[00:43:03.094 --> 00:43:05.694]  So we need your support, plus these are amazing products.
[00:43:05.694 --> 00:43:07.894]  The sale's only running till Tuesday morning.

[00:43:17.735 --> 00:43:19.574]  This is the cleanest, best type out there.
[00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:22.215]   Most iodine isn't absorbed well in the body 'cause it's bound.
[00:43:22.215 --> 00:43:24.654]  This is unbound, it's pure, it's discounted.
[00:43:24.712 --> 00:43:26.512]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:43:35.214 --> 00:43:38.395]  Well, it's now out in the open that the New World Order is destroying America.
[00:43:38.735 --> 00:43:40.375]  But there is a Great Awakening happening.
[00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:44.916]  But if Infowars isn't on the air, if they're able to shut us down, that's going to be a big victory for the enemy.
[00:43:45.216 --> 00:43:51.017]  And so you need to understand, we need your support to be able to really take it to the globalist at the end of 2021 and 2022.
[00:43:52.877 --> 00:44:01.946]  So first off, thanks for all your previous support, and I want to encourage you to take advantage of Black Friday Comes Early that we've been launching for about the last nine years, every single year.

[00:44:37.534 --> 00:44:49.220]  The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravely, and selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:58.945]  Mr. Secretary, President Biden has described the evacuation from Afghanistan as an extraordinary success.
[00:44:59.185 --> 00:45:01.126]  His words, extraordinary success.
[00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:03.688]  This has to be the lie of the 21st century.
[00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:12.647]  Secretary Cald, did I hear you say that Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K are developing the capability to attack the U.S.
[00:45:12.687 --> 00:45:13.608]  within two years?
[00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:26.953]  What I said was that the current intelligence community's assessment is that ISIS-K could potentially develop a capability within six to twelve months, and that Al-Qaeda could potentially develop that capability within one to two years.
[00:45:27.413 --> 00:45:29.334]  We have considerable evidence that they have the intent.
[00:45:29.354 --> 00:45:30.875]  The question at the moment is the capability.
[00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:46.645]  Over the past Halloween weekend, a red alert quietly went off in Northern Virginia informing the public of the possibility of a terrorist attack from an activated ISIS cell that had been sitting dormant in the United States.
[00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:50.127]  Chief Kevin Davis told us today that this is a serious threat.
[00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:58.573]  Now what it is exactly remains a mystery because he couldn't get into the specifics and the information he was able to relay was very vague.
[00:45:59.482 --> 00:46:00.443]  Well, it's information.
[00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:12.955]  The information that we have that we're simply acting on by being vigilant, by establishing a greater presence in places where people gather, whether it's a holiday weekend or just a normal weekend.
[00:46:13.696 --> 00:46:25.285]   It's information that we're now aware of, and because we're aware of this information, and again, it's information that's regional, we're taking the appropriate, responsible Let me ask you about organizations.
[00:46:25.105 --> 00:46:31.824]   the community knows that we take all information about their safety very seriously.
[00:46:31.824 --> 00:46:36.463]   As Biden's open border handlers ramp up a war against American citizens,
[00:46:36.463 --> 00:46:39.264]  deeming them domestic terrorists for thought crimes.
[00:46:39.264 --> 00:46:43.344]   I'm pleased to announce that the administration is today releasing
[00:46:43.344 --> 00:46:47.025]   the first national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.
[00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:52.545]   Let me ask you about organizations. The Oath Keepers are a white supremacist organization, true?
[00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:56.784]  I'm not sure that I can characterize their ideology.
[00:46:56.372 --> 00:47:08.499]  I would say that we have charged a number of individuals related to specific terrorist activity or violent activity, maybe is a better way of putting it, who self-identify with the Oath Keepers.
[00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:14.903]  And I think some of those individuals are ones that we would put in this racially motivated violent extremist category.
[00:47:15.823 --> 00:47:24.011]  We also have a number of such investigations of individuals who self-identify with the Proud Boys in a similar vein.
[00:47:24.051 --> 00:47:27.854]  The biggest threat to Americans is not jihadists overseas.
[00:47:28.474 --> 00:47:32.318]  It's homegrown domestic terrorists inspired by white supremacists.
[00:47:32.398 --> 00:47:35.641]  The gravest terrorist threat to the homeland is domestic violent extremism.
[00:47:35.661 --> 00:47:37.542]  Domestic terrorism is our number one threat.
[00:47:37.562 --> 00:47:42.827]  Domestic terrorism has been steadily increasing and that that threat needs to be addressed.
[00:47:42.847 --> 00:47:48.812]  Mexican drug cartels are controlling more American territory as the border becomes non-existent.
[00:47:49.754 --> 00:47:53.860]  It is a war, make no mistake about it, and it is happening on American soil.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:03.192]  Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples says the same gangs that are blamed for thousands of deaths in Mexico are now threatening our nation's food supply.
[00:48:03.372 --> 00:48:11.580]   Farmers and ranchers are being run off their own property by armed Terrorists showing up and telling them they have to leave the land.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.263]  We witnessed automatic gunfire going from Mexico directly into the United States.
[00:48:18.344 --> 00:48:23.367]  The National Guard soldiers we were with, you can hear them kind of reacting saying, whoa, holy bleep.
[00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:29.810]  They say this is suspected cartel gunfire going indiscriminately directly into the United States.
[00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:44.176]   The National Guard soldiers told us multiple times in recent days, Armed cartel members with AK-47s have stood on the opposite side of the Rio Grande from them and have taunted them, have racked the slides on their guns, and have yelled to them in Spanish that, oh, we should just shoot you soldiers.
[00:48:44.596 --> 00:48:53.440]  So tensions here along the Rio Grande, along the border, obviously going up, and that cartel activity in the city behind us, it's still there.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.123]  The road to chaos has been paved with the Democrats' Marxist subterfuge.
[00:48:58.443 --> 00:49:06.669]  Either we respond with the lightning rod of justice and reclaim our dying republic, or slowly boil past the point of no return.
[00:49:07.049 --> 00:49:08.190]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:49:10.071 --> 00:49:11.392]  It's time to wake up.
[00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:14.954]  It's time to free yourself from the trance.
[00:49:15.935 --> 00:49:25.157]   It's time to realize that global government has been declared, and it's in game, Is forced depopulation of at least 80% of the world.
[00:49:26.457 --> 00:49:34.580]  Well, Drew Hernandez, who's a frequent guest of the show and actually worked with Infowars on Border Stories, is on the stand right now.
[00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:47.145]  They were just showing footage that he shot in Kenosha, and he is now being asked questions by the out-of-control George Soros prosecutor.
[00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:49.026]  Let's go to some of that live.
[00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:50.511]  And you're paid?
[00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:50.932]  Yep.
[00:49:51.592 --> 00:49:52.072]  Who pays you?
[00:49:52.732 --> 00:49:54.573]  I am employed by Real America's Voice.
[00:49:55.594 --> 00:49:57.175]  Real America's Voice?
[00:49:57.315 --> 00:49:57.535]  Yes.
[00:49:57.935 --> 00:49:58.476]  What is that?
[00:49:58.936 --> 00:50:02.858]  That is a news commentary, breaking news website.
[00:50:03.058 --> 00:50:06.380]  They have their own apps and, yeah, website.
[00:50:08.121 --> 00:50:15.045]  Other than getting paid by Real America's Voice, do you get paid by any other source to do your professional commentating?
[00:50:15.385 --> 00:50:15.465]  No.
[00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:21.808]  Is your Drew H. Live website part of Real America's Voice?
[00:50:22.188 --> 00:50:22.348]  No.
[00:50:24.429 --> 00:50:32.211]  The things that you post on your website, Drew H. Live, do you also share those with Real America's Voice?
[00:50:33.652 --> 00:50:36.973]  Depending on what's going on where I'm at.
[00:50:37.913 --> 00:50:42.315]  But this is unrelated to what happened in Kenosha, because I was not employed by Real America's Voice at the time.
[00:50:43.315 --> 00:50:44.776]  That's something that's happened since then?
[00:50:45.256 --> 00:50:45.416]  Yes.
[00:50:46.964 --> 00:50:56.173]  And does Real America's Voice have any sort of political bias or agenda or anything like that?
[00:50:57.294 --> 00:51:01.178]  It goes to the bias of the witness, Your Honor.
[00:51:01.218 --> 00:51:03.500]  The bias in what respect?
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.861]  The freaking video!
[00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:05.542]  The bias!
[00:51:05.922 --> 00:51:09.285]  He shot the video of the child molesters and others trying to kill him!
[00:51:09.746 --> 00:51:11.508]  Hack a scum out and burn him down the town!
[00:51:13.355 --> 00:51:27.130]  I don't know how you would isolate a person's particular politics and determine that that person is going to evaluate the evidence one way or another.
[00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.452]  Okay, I'll move on.
[00:51:30.169 --> 00:51:42.022]  Your videos that you have captured of these incidents that you call riots, they're very slanted against the people who are rioting.
[00:51:42.062 --> 00:51:43.403]  You call riots?
[00:51:43.443 --> 00:51:44.544]  Mostly baseball!
[00:51:44.604 --> 00:51:46.066]  Black Lives Matter rioters.
[00:51:46.306 --> 00:51:47.187]  Three billion in damage.
[00:51:47.207 --> 00:51:49.209]  Because they're rioting in the footage, yes, absolutely.
[00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.671]  So you came here to Kenosha because you felt that's what was going on here?
[00:51:54.631 --> 00:51:58.032]  I felt like it could have possibly been a riot on the first night.
[00:51:58.592 --> 00:52:01.433]  So when I showed up, it turned out to be a very violent riot.
[00:52:02.013 --> 00:52:05.374]  And you continued to cover that on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday night?
[00:52:05.934 --> 00:52:07.134]  I covered it Sunday night.
[00:52:07.995 --> 00:52:10.755]  I went back to Chicago on Monday and then came back Tuesday night.
[00:52:10.775 --> 00:52:11.055]  How evil he is!
[00:52:11.075 --> 00:52:12.176]  Covering the precious rioters!
[00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:13.556]  So you weren't here on Monday night at all?
[00:52:13.696 --> 00:52:13.776]  No.
[00:52:17.302 --> 00:52:21.086]  And on Tuesday night, you were recording video with your body cam?
[00:52:21.226 --> 00:52:21.426]  Yeah.
[00:52:22.127 --> 00:52:24.109]  You were also recording it with your cell phone?
[00:52:24.209 --> 00:52:24.449]  Yes.
[00:52:26.351 --> 00:52:35.119]  The last video that we just watched there of the shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum, was that recorded on your body cam or on your cell phone?
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.380]  Both.
[00:52:38.018 --> 00:52:39.339]  I just saw one video.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.782]  Were there more than one video that you just shared with us?
[00:52:43.162 --> 00:52:43.923]  There's two.
[00:52:44.243 --> 00:52:47.246]  There's the body cam and then there's the cell phone as well.
[00:52:47.746 --> 00:52:49.528]  What was the one we just saw?
[00:52:50.229 --> 00:52:51.490]  I believe that may have been both.
[00:52:54.512 --> 00:52:57.074]  Where is the body cam located when you were on your body?
[00:52:57.235 --> 00:52:57.575]  Right here.
[00:52:58.155 --> 00:53:03.820]  And when you recorded the shooting of Joseph Rosenbaum, where were you holding your cell phone?
[00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:04.661]  Right here.
[00:53:05.998 --> 00:53:11.566]  Okay, so the cell phone is, you're using your right hand, above your shoulder.
[00:53:11.707 --> 00:53:13.707]  Mm-hmm. Is that a yes?
[00:53:13.707 --> 00:53:15.707]  Uh, shoulder...
[00:53:15.707 --> 00:53:21.707]  Uh, same as my shoulder right here.
[00:53:21.482 --> 00:53:24.023]  And the body cam you said was over on the left side of your chest.
[00:53:24.564 --> 00:53:24.984]  Is that right?
[00:53:25.004 --> 00:53:25.944]  I believe so, yes.
[00:53:26.485 --> 00:53:28.706]  The video that we just saw had a single angle.
[00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:30.087]  It didn't have two separate angles.
[00:53:30.247 --> 00:53:33.909]  So when you tell us that's both, I don't understand what you mean.
[00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.652]  That means that there's two recordings of the same thing.
[00:53:37.972 --> 00:53:42.475]  And that's why I submitted to the defense and the prosecution the entire videos.
[00:53:42.695 --> 00:53:44.156]  There's maybe about 80 to 100 videos.
[00:53:44.176 --> 00:53:47.638]  I was trying to confuse the jury that Drew edited it deceptively.
[00:53:48.198 --> 00:53:50.681]  What I'm asking you is what we just watched.
[00:53:51.262 --> 00:53:54.125]  Which camera were you using to record that?
[00:53:54.445 --> 00:53:56.367]  Both.
[00:53:56.387 --> 00:53:58.670]  Is that video edited?
[00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:03.635]  No, I have not edited it, but it has been put together at the right time, the timing.
[00:54:04.056 --> 00:54:04.596]  Who did that?
[00:54:05.377 --> 00:54:05.738]  I did that.
[00:54:07.128 --> 00:54:09.890]  So you combine two video sources into one?
[00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:11.912]  Yeah, that's what you do when you put out a news report.
[00:54:12.292 --> 00:54:17.456]  With the same timing and audio, but at the same time, it can also be seen.
[00:54:17.696 --> 00:54:21.199]  The jury can see for themselves if they look at the body cam footage, it's the exact same thing.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.841]  That's what I'm trying to get at.
[00:54:24.041 --> 00:54:26.924]  Don't wave your head in response to the witness.
[00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:27.604]  What a punk!
[00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:33.769]  You said if the jury looks at the body cam footage, is that separate from the cell phone footage?
[00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:36.011]  Yeah, there's obviously two devices recording.
[00:54:37.215 --> 00:54:41.815]   And you're telling us that the video that we just watched, can we have exhibit 151?
[00:54:41.815 --> 00:54:43.815]  Play it again, please.
[00:54:43.815 --> 00:54:53.015]  This is blowing up in their face so bad.
[00:54:53.048 --> 00:54:58.753]  They're literally supporting a pedophile, a thief, and a wife-beater running around attacking people.
[00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:07.214]   And now they're demonizing a journalist that has a lot of courage.
[00:55:08.214 --> 00:55:10.214]  Does this one go on?
[00:55:10.214 --> 00:55:17.214]   Mr. Hernandez, we have the video that was the last one played for you, Exhibit 151, up on the screen.
[00:55:18.009 --> 00:55:19.490]  Can we play that forward, please?
[00:55:22.772 --> 00:55:30.997]  Now, as we're watching this video, Mr. Hernandez, you're telling us that what we're seeing has been recorded by two separate devices at the same time?
[00:55:31.857 --> 00:55:32.678]  This is a body cam.
[00:55:34.181 --> 00:55:35.542]  And then he put audio from the other camera on it.
[00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:38.305]  Is there a point in this video where it switches to your cell phone?
[00:55:38.345 --> 00:55:38.726]  That's what we do.
[00:55:38.746 --> 00:55:38.886]  Yes.
[00:55:39.346 --> 00:55:40.748]  Can you please point that out to us?
[00:55:40.768 --> 00:55:41.969]  Oh, you'd have to fast forward.
[00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.492]  All the way to when I get to car source three.
[00:55:48.135 --> 00:55:54.302]  Can we skip, um... Yeah, let's skip to the two and a half minute mark, I guess.
[00:55:54.342 --> 00:55:54.902]  I don't know.
[00:55:55.423 --> 00:55:56.364]  This is so incredible.
[00:55:57.805 --> 00:56:03.589]  This idiot is trying to imply that he's deceptively edited it when there's hundreds of camera shots of all this crap happening.
[00:56:03.609 --> 00:56:04.350]  A little further back.
[00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:07.011]  Okay, can we go back maybe 30 seconds?
[00:56:07.031 --> 00:56:07.412]  I don't know.
[00:56:07.792 --> 00:56:08.733]  A little further back.
[00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:10.214]  Right, a little.
[00:56:10.254 --> 00:56:10.794]  Start right here.
[00:56:11.294 --> 00:56:11.535]  Okay.
[00:56:11.855 --> 00:56:12.895]  I'll tell you when it switches.
[00:56:13.116 --> 00:56:13.456]  Okay.
[00:56:13.496 --> 00:56:14.156]  Well, can't it pause?
[00:56:14.176 --> 00:56:14.577]  It's live.
[00:56:15.477 --> 00:56:21.179]  What Drew did is, when it's dark, he uses the body cam, because that got better footage, and when he gets the light, he cuts to the cell phone.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.681]  All you do is take them with a timecode and sync them up on a computer, and you can flip back and forth in the edit.
[00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:28.802]  Most people know that, but they're trying to act like he did something deceptive.
[00:56:28.822 --> 00:56:30.363]  Because there's two different videos.
[00:56:30.563 --> 00:56:46.043]   put together literally no end to this guy
[00:56:45.751 --> 00:56:52.202]  They've got a big problem in the left shop burning down everything and running around doing this stuff.
[00:56:52.243 --> 00:56:59.243]  that we got the footage of these little monsters.
[00:56:59.243 --> 00:57:02.723]   By the way, I now have third world populations running around in my backyard.
[00:57:03.407 --> 00:57:04.747]  In Austin, in West Austin.
[00:57:05.387 --> 00:57:06.707]  Again, today.
[00:57:07.388 --> 00:57:10.528]  I'm gonna start videotaping it.
[00:57:11.068 --> 00:57:13.049]  And you spliced them together.
[00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:17.169]  I don't know if I would say splice, but I put them together.
[00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:22.851]  That's an old-fashioned movie term from when they used to have actual film.
[00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:24.771]  Why did you do that?
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:30.662]  Um, like I said, you can take a look at the body cam footage as well.
[00:57:30.823 --> 00:57:33.364]  You can see it as well on there.
[00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:47.671]  And you, you're testifying here today that through your attorney, you have provided the defense in the state with that entire incident recorded on both your body cam and on your cell phone?
[00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:52.251]  But what we just saw was your editing of them together.
[00:57:52.531 --> 00:57:54.692]  You guys asked for my footage, so I gave it to you.
[00:57:55.292 --> 00:57:55.973]  Through your attorney?
[00:57:56.373 --> 00:57:56.553]  Yes.
[00:57:57.253 --> 00:57:59.935]  That's an attorney that you have out of Madison?
[00:58:00.095 --> 00:58:02.496]  What's the relevance of this?
[00:58:03.276 --> 00:58:06.318]  Your Honor, we've had a lot of questions about other people... What's the relevance of this?
[00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:09.555]  All right, let's go to break.
[00:58:09.615 --> 00:58:10.235]  Hit pause there.
[00:58:10.255 --> 00:58:11.396]  I know it's live, but we can pause it now.
[00:58:11.416 --> 00:58:12.336]  I'm going to come back with more of this.
[00:58:12.896 --> 00:58:19.017]  By the way, in all the Democrat-run Sandy Hook suits they sue, it's all about, what prescriptions are you on?
[00:58:19.797 --> 00:58:20.798]  How do your satellites work?
[00:58:20.838 --> 00:58:21.578]  Who are your affiliates?
[00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:22.338]  Who are your sponsors?
[00:58:22.518 --> 00:58:23.558]  How do we shut you down?
[00:58:24.018 --> 00:58:25.579]  Nothing to do with the Sandy Hook people.
[00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:31.560]  So, I mean, watching a real judge versus these people is unbelievable.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.440]  But, I mean, we know that.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.760]  And by the way, that judge is a Democrat.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.941]  He's just an old school one that's not a complete monster.
[00:58:37.757 --> 00:58:40.658]  All right, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:58:41.179 --> 00:58:46.621]  Tomorrow's news today, we'll be right back with more of Drew Hernandez in the Rittenhouse trial.
[00:58:47.581 --> 00:58:58.006]  Countries across the world are announcing lockdowns for the unvaccinated as more governments ban the Pfizer and Moderna shots for causing heart attacks.
[00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:19.505]   That's coming up, but we are focusing some on the Rittenhouse trial because a reporter we've interviewed many times and actually worked with some on the board of Drew Hernandez Is there in Kenosha on the stand and we're watching the rat-like Soros lawyer Go after him and it's it's it's it's blowing up in his face.
[00:59:19.545 --> 00:59:22.705]  He's trying to imply that because he's got a body cam It's black and white.
[00:59:22.745 --> 00:59:27.487]  He's got a cell phone that's color when he gets into the areas that are more lighted He's got the footage synced up.
[00:59:27.527 --> 00:59:29.367]  They show that when it's darker.
[00:59:29.407 --> 00:59:30.168]  They show the black and white.
[00:59:30.208 --> 00:59:32.661]   He's trying to imply that Oh, a lawyer!
[00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:38.964]  You hired a lawyer to fake all this when they have the raw footage from both the cell phone and the cam.
[00:59:39.245 --> 00:59:41.886]  They know they have it in evidence, bait-stamped as it's called.
[00:59:42.387 --> 00:59:43.427]  They're just playing games.
[00:59:43.467 --> 00:59:53.413]  They also asked for his edited video that he put out on the Internet, which is, again, not edited for deception, but edited to put the best footage together of what happened in a linear way.
[00:59:53.694 --> 00:59:54.054]  Here it is.
[00:59:56.756 --> 00:59:58.838]  ...an attorney to provide video on this case.
[00:59:59.439 --> 01:00:00.660]  I think it goes to bias.
[01:00:01.621 --> 01:00:02.942]  I think it goes to credibility.
[01:00:04.043 --> 01:00:06.646]  It's been asked of other witnesses... Let's take the lunch break.
[01:00:07.106 --> 01:00:09.088]  Please don't talk about the case during the break.
[01:00:11.971 --> 01:00:20.739]  Yeah, again, they said they're going to a lunch break, but...
[01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:26.816]  We'd pause this before we went to break and they're still going as of when I was outside just a moment ago.
[01:00:26.836 --> 01:00:27.536]  So let's go back to it.
[01:00:30.538 --> 01:00:32.659]  All right, so we've got a bit of a mystery going here.
[01:00:33.979 --> 01:00:37.901]  All right, now I decided to go to break and I guess the news is just looping something from earlier.
[01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.202]  Well, as that unfolds, we will go over all of it for you.
[01:00:41.983 --> 01:00:42.263]  All right.
[01:00:43.563 --> 01:00:44.544]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:54.698]  The news today, and this is happening more and more, obviously, because the globals are taking over and things are getting really bad.
[01:00:54.718 --> 01:01:08.109]  But if I was a wartime broadcaster, say in World War II or Vietnam, and there was big battles going on, I would just come in for maybe 5-10 minutes at a space and talk about what was happening.
[01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:12.072]  But that's not the way this is.
[01:01:12.092 --> 01:01:29.421]   I mean, I could talk for 100 hours and never get to all this and I'm just completely exhausted by it, and I have a responsibility to cover all this, but at the same time, maybe I just want to tune in and watch football or something.
[01:01:29.461 --> 01:01:33.422]  I mean, maybe the globalists are right, and maybe it's just too much what they're doing.
[01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:42.525]  I should have tied my head in the sand and let them just go ahead and kill all the kids, and just take all the shots they say, and just slowly die, because they're superior to me.
[01:01:43.065 --> 01:01:44.085]  They're the globalists.
[01:01:44.205 --> 01:01:45.465]  They deserve to inherit the earth.
[01:01:46.926 --> 01:01:48.546]  But I can't do that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:50.245 --> 01:01:50.986]  I can't do that.
[01:01:51.286 --> 01:01:54.308]  So I'm not going to do that.
[01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.110]  I'm going to cover the news.
[01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:06.135]  And the only way I can do this is to just start over and just start plowing right through this stuff.
[01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:07.476]  But it's just unbelievable.
[01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:12.840]  I mean, they're on the news announcing we're going to put implantable microchips in you to make sure you're vaccinated.
[01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:18.320]  And then they have separate articles saying it doesn't exist, but we need to take the microchip.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:22.582]  There is no microchip, but you need to take it and we're going to do it to you.
[01:02:22.602 --> 01:02:36.050]  I mean, it's just, it's so crazy to see this type of warfare using propaganda and confusion and demoralization and the outright poisoning of the population.
[01:02:38.111 --> 01:02:44.317]   And because the population's never faced a type of covert war like this, The population doesn't know what hit them.
[01:02:44.357 --> 01:02:51.519]  I mean, the clips of the Australian Chancellor, the leader of their Parliament.
[01:02:52.959 --> 01:02:53.600]  Creepily.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.640]  I mean, I could cover the whole show just on this.
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.661]  Your life's over.
[01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.241]  You know, we're going to put you in a camp.
[01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:03.142]  If we catch you outside your house when you're not vaccinated, we're going to put you in a camp.
[01:03:03.874 --> 01:03:05.536]  We're going to make your life miserable.
[01:03:05.556 --> 01:03:10.280]  And then they've got other Australian premiers, governors saying it.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.063]  They've got the New Zealand Prime Minister saying it.
[01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:17.647]  And it's just so damn evil.
[01:03:18.627 --> 01:03:26.574]  I mean, this isn't like growing up as a kid and you watch some cartoon where there's Lex Luthor and the Legion of Doom and they're doing bad stuff and they cackle and giggle.
[01:03:27.214 --> 01:03:37.663]  There's footage of the Maine Health Minister cackling like a witch and saying, your life's basically over and we're going to give you a shot every two months and snickering and giggling with big ugly yellow teeth.
[01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:45.250]  And I've just gotten to the point of, yeah, OK, the trial's still going here, I guess.
[01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.931]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:03:48.848 --> 01:03:52.489]  Do you have an expert from a law firm?
[01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.610]  Is that what you're telling me?
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.991]  Am I understanding that right?
[01:03:56.811 --> 01:03:59.411]  is representing this witness.
[01:03:59.411 --> 01:04:01.131]  So I think that that goes to bias.
[01:04:01.131 --> 01:04:02.811]  Do you have an expert from a law firm?
[01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:04.050]  Is that what you're telling me?
[01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.971]  Am I understanding that right?
[01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:08.730]  The expert did a phone dump.
[01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:14.850]   So they have an expert who does what you would describe as when
[01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:19.650]   law enforcement takes a cell phone and does a search of the phone.
[01:04:19.727 --> 01:04:19.987]  Sure.
[01:04:20.007 --> 01:04:20.567]  Okay.
[01:04:21.068 --> 01:04:23.209]  That's what he did.
[01:04:23.949 --> 01:04:27.391]  They employ someone there to do it for anyone.
[01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:33.594]  And we use that person to do it for Mr. Rittenhouse.
[01:04:34.949 --> 01:04:39.693]  They did no legal work, as that term for a lawyer-client kind of thing.
[01:04:40.033 --> 01:04:44.857]  He did it to do, I think it's a cellbrite extraction?
[01:04:45.957 --> 01:04:58.147]  If you ask me to do a phone book, in addition to thinking, I would have to go to somebody to comply.
[01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.691]  By the way, this is what's going on in the Sandy Hook stuff.
[01:05:03.051 --> 01:05:05.992]  They ask for computer stuff that has nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[01:05:07.812 --> 01:05:15.575]  And then they go, well, this isn't the ZR79Q way of transferring a file, so we say it's not real.
[01:05:16.115 --> 01:05:19.876]  I mean, it's like just game after game after game.
[01:05:20.696 --> 01:05:22.397]  It's the same crap this Soros guy's doing.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:29.410]  This is all meant to confuse the jury, even though they're out of the room right now.
[01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:31.550]  or get him out of a divorce or something like that.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.710]  It's directly pertaining to the--
[01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.590]   This is all meant to confuse the jury, even though they're out of the room right now.
[01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.509]  He was doing it earlier when they were in there.
[01:05:38.509 --> 01:05:41.269]  That this is somehow fake.
[01:05:41.442 --> 01:05:50.470]  The lawyers made him go to the data dump expert guy they've got hired to forensically do it, to document it was his phone and his footage.
[01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.712]  Which is a ridiculous level to go to.
[01:05:53.152 --> 01:05:54.393]  This is a big high-profile case.
[01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:59.498]  So now because it was done by a forensics person, they're acting like that's bad.
[01:05:59.558 --> 01:06:01.660]  I mean, this is just next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:02.521 --> 01:06:14.360]   This is the next level. And it just blows my mind that we sit here as a society and put up with this.
[01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:17.863]  But look, I'll go back to more of the Rittenhouse if anything important comes up.
[01:06:17.883 --> 01:06:18.803]  But he's totally innocent.
[01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:19.743]  He's vindicated.
[01:06:19.763 --> 01:06:20.664]  It's blown up in their face.
[01:06:21.124 --> 01:06:23.565]  But don't underestimate the power of political correctness.
[01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:27.567]  They got one leftist juror on that panel.
[01:06:27.587 --> 01:06:36.771]  They will attack and belittle and pressure that jury until they vote to send Rittenhouse to prison.
[01:06:38.737 --> 01:06:43.540]  And they want it bad, but I think he's going to be found not guilty because it's just so overwhelming.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.122]  If leftists on the jury, you know, they're on there trying to bully the other jurors, I think it'll blow up in their face.
[01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:57.387]  So I say he's found not guilty, but I could be wrong because I have seen the power of the leftist brainwashing.
[01:06:57.487 --> 01:07:06.695]   I mean, You see the entire media defending a convicted child rapist who raped a bunch of little boys, running around saying, I'm going to kill you to somebody and trying to take his gun away and attacking him.
[01:07:07.075 --> 01:07:11.616]  And they're defending him like he is the second coming of Christ, which is perfect.
[01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:18.938]  I mean, they'll probably make the guy a patron saint or something because their religion is hurting children.
[01:07:19.758 --> 01:07:23.518]  All right, we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and just rampage through the news.
[01:07:24.438 --> 01:07:26.239]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:27.339]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:07:30.026 --> 01:07:35.927]  All right, we are broadcasting worldwide on this November 11th, Thursday transmission.
[01:07:37.127 --> 01:07:35.927]  11.11.
[01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:43.048]  Okay, I'm just going to start where I began last hour.
[01:07:43.088 --> 01:07:45.449]  A lot of people just joined us, and this is such huge news.
[01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.289]  It should be on every news channel in the world.
[01:07:47.969 --> 01:07:49.809]  It should be shouted from the rooftops.
[01:07:49.869 --> 01:07:51.370]  It should be at every PTA meeting.
[01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:55.270]  It should be parents angry at all these vaccination centers.
[01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:56.510]  It should be there warning people.
[01:07:56.530 --> 01:08:19.504]   I mean, imagine if you knew That milk at a school lunch program in, say, Albuquerque, New Mexico, that a couple hundred cartons of that milk had gotten contaminated with, say, E. coli, and that it might hurt or kill children, and you were the person that discovered that for whatever reason, you would call the school.
[01:08:21.215 --> 01:08:23.636]  And then if you didn't see anything take action, you'd call the police.
[01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:28.378]  Hell, you'd probably, you know, if you live close by, get in the car and drive there to warn people, right?
[01:08:28.398 --> 01:08:30.459]  Because that's a normal thing to do.
[01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:33.441]  That's something that, you know, you want other people to act like that.
[01:08:35.222 --> 01:08:40.904]  But here is the FDA run by a bunch of revolving door individuals paid off by Big Pharma on record.
[01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:44.626]  And the head of Reuters, you know, on the board of it as well, running their scam.
[01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:47.548]  And Pfizer's the big globalist arm doing all this.
[01:08:48.928 --> 01:08:50.369]  With their mRNA vaccine.
[01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:55.175]  And they want to be able to just put in you what they want, when they want, how they want.
[01:08:57.816 --> 01:08:58.476]  Whenever they want.
[01:08:59.316 --> 01:09:06.458]  And so they actually came out with shots that we knew two years ago, almost two years ago, were going to cause serious problems, and we predicted what would happen.
[01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:11.600]  And in October, documents came out where the FDA and CDC said exactly what the experts on my show had said.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:21.623]  Blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks, autoimmune problems, ADE, antibody dependency enhancement.
[01:09:23.968 --> 01:09:25.449]  And now we see all that happening.
[01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.431]  Well, they knew more than we did.
[01:09:27.491 --> 01:09:28.952]  They launched the whole plan.
[01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:29.873]  They created the virus.
[01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:30.674]  They created the fear.
[01:09:31.314 --> 01:09:31.795]  They did it.
[01:09:32.695 --> 01:09:39.561]  And it just so happens every damn one of them, from Peter Daszak to Fauci to Bill Gates, run their mouth about wanting to get rid of the population.
[01:09:39.581 --> 01:09:50.510]  I mean, when you watch the movie 12 Monkeys, in like five minutes you figure out this guy is going to release a bioweapon and he's a crazy environmentalist.
[01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:51.931]  He wants to get rid of humans.
[01:09:52.011 --> 01:09:52.832]  I mean, they're telling you.
[01:09:54.288 --> 01:09:58.291]  But you actually see it in the real world and people are like, whoa, I'm not going to believe that.
[01:09:58.692 --> 01:09:59.632]  That's too frightening.
[01:10:01.394 --> 01:10:02.314]  Same thing with Trump.
[01:10:02.735 --> 01:10:07.238]  Once Trump got tricked into this thing and he get the economy going by a vaccine, he thought it was a regular vaccine.
[01:10:07.878 --> 01:10:14.183]  Once he took it and thinks he's fine, probably wasn't even given it, he doesn't want to admit that he got tricked.
[01:10:14.263 --> 01:10:15.124]  So he's committed.
[01:10:15.904 --> 01:10:17.225]  I said this over a year and a half ago.
[01:10:17.265 --> 01:10:31.787]   I said Trump And the lawyers and the teachers and the bureaucrats and the parents that have gone along with this, when it comes out that it causes all these problems, they're going to defend it and keep doubling down because they don't want to admit they're wrong.
[01:10:31.867 --> 01:10:32.528]  It's too scary.
[01:10:33.909 --> 01:10:43.656]  That's the difference between conscious, informed, powerful individuals and slaves, is that slaves, I don't care if they're billionaires or living by the side of the river.
[01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:46.438]  What I'm saying is, is that they're spiritually poor.
[01:10:46.779 --> 01:10:48.640]  They don't know how to admit when they're wrong.
[01:10:50.157 --> 01:10:57.218]  They just second-to-second believe that they're fine, everything's okay because of selfishness.
[01:10:58.038 --> 01:11:01.319]  Innate, intense ignorance and selfishness.
[01:11:02.679 --> 01:11:05.000]  And of course nobody is as alone as a selfish person.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.300]  Nobody is as alone as these people are.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.581]  And so this was all done by behavioral psychologists, they war-gamed it, all that's admitted.
[01:11:13.141 --> 01:11:31.668]   And they are seducing the world and the decadent West To not even want to admit they got conned, but to get into wearing the mask and living in fear and, you know, being heroes in 15 days to stop the spread and flatten the curve.
[01:11:33.328 --> 01:11:35.949]  And we're coming up on two years of this crap in a couple months.
[01:11:36.529 --> 01:11:38.130]  And they're now like, well, it's permanent.
[01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:42.411]  Well, if you don't take whatever the shots are, you can't leave your house.
[01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:44.211]  And if we catch you, you're going to prison.
[01:11:46.178 --> 01:11:56.822]  Imagine if I told you five years ago they're gonna release a virus and use it as a pretext for a global ID and a global lockdown and use successive viral releases to keep tightening things down until we have absolutely no freedoms.
[01:11:57.082 --> 01:11:58.863]  Well, you'd say I was Alex Jones, wouldn't you?
[01:11:59.003 --> 01:12:00.004]  Alex Jones did say that.
[01:12:02.044 --> 01:12:07.927]  Because Alex Jones reads the documents like Operation Lockstep and Alex Jones cites the documents.
[01:12:09.647 --> 01:12:33.357]   And I cited for you From the FDA's own website, their own information from October 26th, that no one even picked up on until yesterday, that they're putting a dangerous heart attack drug in the shot, that it says, do not inject into muscle, it can kill somebody, and they're injecting into muscle.
[01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.659]  And you're like, well, they're going to get caught, that's crazy.
[01:12:35.979 --> 01:12:36.799]  They don't care.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.664]  They're doing it on purpose to set the... And then all the people injecting this are involved in a crime too.
[01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:46.442]  You know, there was a great movie on HBO.
[01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:47.703]  I got to meet the producer.
[01:12:47.903 --> 01:12:48.403]  He's a listener.
[01:12:48.463 --> 01:12:51.965]  One time he came to visit me, but he's the most most British guy on HBO.
[01:12:51.985 --> 01:12:55.867]  I'm not going to say his name, but he was the producer of the series Rome.
[01:12:56.368 --> 01:13:03.912]  It's a very accurate series from the period and actually what happened in like Julius Caesar has hired this one centurion to go around and make all the payoffs for him.
[01:13:03.952 --> 01:13:08.334]  He's a famous hero and very respected and people see the hero at their house to pay him off.
[01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:11.816]  They just go ahead and take the payoff and then he goes good.
[01:13:12.572 --> 01:13:20.378]  You've gotten them to sell out for almost nothing, and now that they're corrupted, I won't even have to pay them off in the future, because I can just expose the fact they're corrupted.
[01:13:20.398 --> 01:13:22.080]  You see how that works?
[01:13:24.522 --> 01:13:34.630]  You know, when the globalists planted child porn on us, they approached and they're like, hey, we can talk to you now, and Alex can, you know, we're not going to release the fact that there's child porn on his email.
[01:13:36.576 --> 01:13:39.497]  I went on air the next day, said, you're not framing me.
[01:13:39.537 --> 01:13:40.458]  We never opened that email.
[01:13:40.478 --> 01:13:41.418]  That's not child porn.
[01:13:41.898 --> 01:13:44.539]  And we got the FBI to issue a letter saying we were the victims of that.
[01:13:44.599 --> 01:13:51.562]  But they just thought I'd be like all the other people that were corrupted at the Boy Scouts and the Vatican and everywhere else where they weren't involved in the pedophilia.
[01:13:51.783 --> 01:13:55.104]  But they, well, don't say anything about this or it'll hurt you too.
[01:13:55.624 --> 01:13:58.345]  Just cover this up with us and, you know, burn in hell.
[01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:03.307]  So this is how they operate and it's how they work.
[01:14:03.327 --> 01:14:09.032]   And this is a giant Seduction going on right now.
[01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:17.240]  This is a giant seduction and corruption taking place.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:27.149]  And do you think the soccer moms, when their child gets a chronic heart problem, do you think when she buries that child, on average, in three years to ten years, three to ten years, they die after having myocarditis?
[01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:29.551]  Fifty-six percent?
[01:14:29.571 --> 01:14:31.233]  Fifty-six percent die?
[01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.970]  Within three to ten years?
[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:36.231]  You think those moms are going to admit they killed their child?
[01:14:36.331 --> 01:14:36.571]  No.
[01:14:37.032 --> 01:14:38.772]  They're going to inject any other children.
[01:14:38.972 --> 01:14:41.193]  These mothers don't care if they kill all three of them.
[01:14:41.413 --> 01:14:43.033]  I'm talking about mothers that are under the spell.
[01:14:44.954 --> 01:14:46.154]  And that mother will fight.
[01:14:46.214 --> 01:14:47.355]  Hell, she'll probably become a nurse.
[01:14:47.595 --> 01:14:49.015]  And she'll come with the police one day.
[01:14:49.295 --> 01:14:52.816]  And she'll hold your child down while you're putting the back of a paddy wagon to inject them.
[01:14:56.297 --> 01:14:56.778]  They love it.
[01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:57.978]  They love dying.
[01:14:58.018 --> 01:14:58.798]  They love death.
[01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.199]  They love fraud.
[01:15:00.219 --> 01:15:01.259]  They love evil.
[01:15:05.546 --> 01:15:07.386]  And so that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:08.567 --> 01:15:09.647]  And that's the process.
[01:15:10.727 --> 01:15:13.948]  So then I ask all of you, why would anybody sell out to these people?
[01:15:14.368 --> 01:15:20.850]  So you can drive around in a fancy car and stuff for a few more years and lose your soul?
[01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:24.890]  I mean, even if you don't believe in God, do you really want to be involved killing children?
[01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:29.351]  I mean, do you really want to be involved with all this stuff with the CEO of Pfizer?
[01:15:29.632 --> 01:15:31.432]  Ooh, the big powerful man.
[01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:34.967]  Oh, the big text says they're going to live forever.
[01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:35.967]  Ray Kurzweil.
[01:15:36.007 --> 01:15:38.589]  No, Ray Kurzweil, you're going to be dead in the ground just like your father.
[01:15:38.849 --> 01:15:40.289]  You're never going to resurrect your father.
[01:15:40.309 --> 01:15:41.810]  You're never going to resurrect yourself.
[01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.831]  You're a joke.
[01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:43.751]  You're a con man.
[01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:44.812]  You're a fraud.
[01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:48.554]  What, you invented a paper scanner?
[01:15:49.409 --> 01:15:53.111]  And so now you tell us that you're going to become a God and step on us?
[01:15:53.991 --> 01:15:56.452]  No, God's going to flush you down the galactic toilet.
[01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:00.034]  And all of you globalists, you're all loser jokes.
[01:16:00.414 --> 01:16:02.515]  So keep playing God, you're going to burn.
[01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:12.439]  It is literally life and death for us to expose the fact that the Pfizer shot has a heart attack drug in it.
[01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:15.167]  In fact, today I'm going to make a flyer.
[01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:19.068]  We did this 10 years ago with the H1N1 vaccine that was causing a lot of illnesses.
[01:16:19.488 --> 01:16:20.468]  Nothing compared to this.
[01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:31.271]  And we created flyers on the site and told listeners that they should, if they wanted to, go print those off and post them in legal and lawful areas.
[01:16:31.531 --> 01:16:39.493]  And the thing that would happen would be the media would get pissed that people dare engage in the First Amendment.
[01:16:40.794 --> 01:16:46.258]  And it ended up getting on close to 100 local radio stations in just one campaign we did.
[01:16:47.579 --> 01:17:16.336]   And so now, imagine if you printed off just regular printer paper size, with an image and a statement on it, with a fact at the bottom that the Pfizer injection for children contains a dangerous heart attack drug, and that this is all done in emergency authorization, Some people are going to get warned and care, and they're going to warn others.
[01:17:16.476 --> 01:17:22.400]  Others are going to get pissed and call the media, and the media will self-righteously come.
[01:17:24.009 --> 01:17:40.416]  And say this is so evil, we need to arrest who's done this, and then I'll get letters threatening from San Francisco and places that if you put these up again we're going to have you arrested for terrorizing the public or we're going to have you arrested for people littering because some of the papers fell on the ground.
[01:17:40.676 --> 01:17:45.578]  Meanwhile they're promoting people that are pedophiles and rapists and shooting people and killing people.
[01:17:46.278 --> 01:17:53.980]  You know, San Francisco jurors let illegal aliens go that willfully shoot white women in the back because they're white, and they deserve to die because they're white.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:54.420]  Remember that?
[01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:57.161]  It's just so crazy.
[01:17:57.581 --> 01:18:02.182]  So, oh, mostly peaceful, burning things down, fiery, but mostly peaceful.
[01:18:03.923 --> 01:18:06.464]  So yeah, that's the bare minimum of civil disobedience is.
[01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:08.724]  Let's just do this.
[01:18:08.824 --> 01:18:10.965]  Send them to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:18:12.594 --> 01:18:15.135]  Everybody, get on your own Photoshop, create your own flyer.
[01:18:15.155 --> 01:18:17.015]  It could be color, it could not be color, whatever.
[01:18:17.796 --> 01:18:31.940]  And any ones I look at this afternoon that are accurate based on the facts about promethamine and these articles, I'm going to post on the front page of the site tomorrow and have a call to action for everybody to go post them.
[01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:39.294]  In areas of your towns and your cities, and it ends up happening around the world, even in New Zealand and Australia.
[01:18:39.334 --> 01:18:49.481]  Hell, we need a whole section on the site with flyers for New Zealand, flyers for... Because anybody can do this, but InfoWars is one of the few places that still has millions of viewers that can't be censored as easy.
[01:18:49.962 --> 01:18:52.984]  In the old days, you could put this on Facebook or Twitter and some people would see it.
[01:18:53.364 --> 01:18:56.226]  Now they won't let you defend anybody or warn anybody.
[01:18:56.246 --> 01:18:58.228]  They want to hold you down while all this happens.
[01:19:00.976 --> 01:19:05.657]  I'll have the crew make some simple stuff as well that has the facts on it, but I'd like to see what you send in.
[01:19:05.737 --> 01:19:08.458]  Show tips at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:08.478 --> 01:19:18.840]  A lot of folks come up with like a cobra with fangs and it would say, warning, you know, the H1N1 vaccine contains this.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.001]  Well, this, this, you can tell them what it contains.
[01:19:21.541 --> 01:19:25.542]  Experimental mRNA with a heart attack drug that's been illegally added.
[01:19:25.882 --> 01:19:27.402]  I mean, we got to really hit them.
[01:19:29.269 --> 01:19:32.772]  And we got to stop waiting, because I've been thinking, what am I going to do civil disobedience-wise?
[01:19:35.735 --> 01:19:39.658]  And I have climbed billboards before and spray-painted them.
[01:19:39.758 --> 01:19:43.021]  I mean, it's fun to go out at 3 a.m.
[01:19:43.061 --> 01:19:45.803]  and do that, but I'm not going to tell you to do that because you'd fall off and die.
[01:19:45.863 --> 01:19:47.865]  But, I mean, just do whatever you think is best.
[01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:49.266]  It's up to you what you do.
[01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:51.128]  But are we going to let them kill these children?
[01:19:53.194 --> 01:19:55.175]  We're gonna go do sit-ins at these clinics?
[01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:58.077]  At Walgreens or wherever the stuff's going on?
[01:19:58.137 --> 01:19:59.178]  We gotta start doing something.
[01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:04.341]  Because I don't feel, you know, God feels very approvingly of me right now.
[01:20:04.361 --> 01:20:06.343]  Yeah, I'm not doing enough.
[01:20:06.363 --> 01:20:07.103]  I need to do more.
[01:20:08.464 --> 01:20:11.226]  Yeah, go read the 198 Methods of Nonviolent Action.
[01:20:12.366 --> 01:20:13.507]  Very important information.
[01:20:14.108 --> 01:20:15.689]  It's very accurate and it's very powerful.
[01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:16.369]  You should use it.
[01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:20.752]  I'll say that again for radio listeners.
[01:20:22.829 --> 01:20:24.970]  198 methods of nonviolent protest and persuasion.
[01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:27.972]  We better start doing it now.
[01:20:28.853 --> 01:20:33.196]  The bare minimum is take the feed of this show, take the archives of this show, take the articles.
[01:20:33.236 --> 01:20:33.957]  I mean, look at this.
[01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:35.198]  Look at this stuff.
[01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:36.899]  Let me just stop for the rest of the segment.
[01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.001]  We've got Jay Dyer coming on as a guest.
[01:20:40.322 --> 01:20:45.766]  He's really an expert on the occult and the Illuminati and how they're operating, what really happened in this occultic ritual.
[01:20:46.746 --> 01:20:51.370]  They did exactly what it was supposed to do in Houston last weekend.
[01:20:52.276 --> 01:20:55.457]  With Travis Scott and Drake and the rest of it.
[01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.337]  And so he's going to be joining us.
[01:20:58.658 --> 01:21:00.058]  Let me just do this since I said I would.
[01:21:00.698 --> 01:21:01.778]  Here's the main focus.
[01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:06.960]  Promethamine is used to treat and prevent problems in the blood.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:14.422]  FDA documents show Pfizer secretly added heart attack drug to children's COVID vaccines.
[01:21:14.962 --> 01:21:17.082]  There's the link in my article to the FDA document.
[01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.283]  Here's the FDA document.
[01:21:18.303 --> 01:21:19.043]  It's on page 14.
[01:21:22.361 --> 01:21:29.623]  And then we've got all the literature about what it actually does and how toxic it is in the body, how it can't be injected into muscle and the side effects.
[01:21:30.823 --> 01:21:32.463]  And that's how they are injecting it in the children.
[01:21:32.483 --> 01:21:33.624]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:21:35.364 --> 01:21:36.684]  And it goes on from there.
[01:21:38.105 --> 01:21:40.785]  The propaganda, the majority of parents are going to get it.
[01:21:41.145 --> 01:21:42.506]  So people go, oh, I better do it.
[01:21:42.586 --> 01:21:43.186]  It's all lies.
[01:21:45.226 --> 01:21:51.768]  Meanwhile, Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer comments on legally distinct wording.
[01:21:53.246 --> 01:22:01.208]  They got Common... Common Renteri is the drug that's approved in 2026, and the Pfizer vaccine is not approved.
[01:22:01.228 --> 01:22:03.388]  Now they play those deceptive games.
[01:22:03.468 --> 01:22:07.229]  Even TheHeavy.com, that's not a right-wing publication, goes, wow, that's crazy.
[01:22:07.249 --> 01:22:08.049]  You know, lies.
[01:22:09.949 --> 01:22:12.470]  Oh, the tiny tweak behind COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:20.672]  Oh, they added a heart attack drug, and they added a chemical in it so it can get hot, which, by the way, they say don't ever inject in the human body.
[01:22:20.692 --> 01:22:21.892]  I got all that, too.
[01:22:24.452 --> 01:22:27.133]  Oh, and don't worry, the researchers are hatching a low-cost coronavirus vaccine.
[01:22:27.153 --> 01:22:28.134]  They're going to make you take it.
[01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:31.756]  We've got all the studies and reports on how dangerous it is.
[01:22:32.436 --> 01:22:33.997]  We've got the fact sheets on the chemical.
[01:22:34.017 --> 01:22:37.259]  I'm going to be doing a whole other report on that today.
[01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:39.099]  But here it is.
[01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:44.342]  It's the Tris buffer at hopaxfc.com.
[01:22:44.362 --> 01:22:46.003]  You can read all about the buffer they're using.
[01:22:48.283 --> 01:22:56.085]  And then they go into it, it says the concerns, it has a tendency to permeate membranes, therefore it is not suitable for most cell culture work.
[01:22:57.145 --> 01:22:59.646]  It is a, it is toxic for many mammalian cells.
[01:22:59.846 --> 01:23:02.726]  We're a mammal folks, just so you know.
[01:23:02.746 --> 01:23:03.367]  Goes on from there.
[01:23:03.387 --> 01:23:04.907]  One arm, good for you.
[01:23:05.567 --> 01:23:07.187]  Also antifreeze in the shot, but hey.
[01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:12.229]  It's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps, because you know why.
[01:23:12.289 --> 01:23:13.369]  Where's the black turtleneck?
[01:23:15.945 --> 01:23:19.168]  Anderson Cooper, you know, he's got the Planned Parenthood lady on saying, take all your shots.
[01:23:19.889 --> 01:23:23.232]  They didn't kill you when you were little, they're gonna kill you now, and it's okay, because he's gay, right?
[01:23:23.272 --> 01:23:23.732]  Look, there they are.
[01:23:24.593 --> 01:23:26.655]  They got the doctor on there with the bowtie from Baylor.
[01:23:26.675 --> 01:23:36.945]  They're like, yeah, the heart attacks, you know, it's no big deal, that's 15 times, you know, the normal amount, but that's okay, 15 times is no big deal, and this is all up there telling us, have a heart attack, it's normal, come on.
[01:23:39.906 --> 01:23:41.807]  We've got to play this, even though Jadar's coming up.
[01:23:42.287 --> 01:23:53.454]  G20 Brazil, Bolsonaro questions the Director General of the WHO about how people are dying despite having the second shot, and how more people are sick from the shot, and how the UN lockdowns have caused tens of millions to starve to death.
[01:23:53.834 --> 01:23:54.695]  Wow, what a great leader.
[01:23:55.015 --> 01:23:56.015]  That's what Trump ought to be doing.
[01:23:58.017 --> 01:24:02.439]  There's so much incredible stuff that I've got here, but let me hit this right here.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.922]  Israel holds war games to prepare for more lethal COVID strain.
[01:24:08.005 --> 01:24:12.168]  And that means, oh, the next round of shots and how they're going to lock down because it's never going to end.
[01:24:12.188 --> 01:24:14.389]  There's always going to be new COVID strains that they've introduced.
[01:24:14.769 --> 01:24:16.230]  It just keeps replicating and changing.
[01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:19.793]  Yep, Israel's the model for endless martial law.
[01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:23.995]  Germany hits record new COVID cases, despite being one of the most vaccinated countries in Europe.
[01:24:24.335 --> 01:24:25.076]  And it gets worse.
[01:24:25.796 --> 01:24:30.519]  They now are admitting it's causing heart attacks in children and are saying don't give the Moderna shot to people under 30.
[01:24:30.859 --> 01:24:33.081]  Now Germany's joined France and a bunch of other European countries.
[01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.942]  But you'll never hear that on the news here.
[01:24:36.275 --> 01:24:43.037]  Taiwan halts second dose of BioNTech vaccinations for ages 12 to 17 amid concerns of mycocarditis.
[01:24:45.518 --> 01:24:47.899]  A whistleblower says Pfizer falsified data.
[01:24:47.919 --> 01:24:49.139]  That's in the British Medical Journal.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.320]  It's huge news, but they just roll forward.
[01:24:53.341 --> 01:25:00.803]  And then I've got in my stack, here's the Bolsonaro news, that incredible announcement out of Australia in the Associated Press.
[01:25:01.693 --> 01:25:06.738]  Where they say that we're coming to forcibly inoculate you and if you don't, we're going to lock you up inside your house.
[01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:08.620]  We've got all that coming up.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:14.585]  In fact, guys, I can't find that AP article saying Australian leader says lockdowns for the unvaccinated coming.
[01:25:15.446 --> 01:25:17.368]  So just go ahead and just reprint that for me.
[01:25:17.408 --> 01:25:17.688]  Thank you.
[01:25:17.748 --> 01:25:18.629]  I'll cover that next segment.
[01:25:20.011 --> 01:25:20.951]  We're going to go to break here.
[01:25:20.971 --> 01:25:24.515]  I just want to encourage the listeners to support the broadcast and keep us on air.
[01:25:25.527 --> 01:25:26.748]  Make it very easy right now.
[01:25:26.808 --> 01:25:29.509]  We've got a sale running until Tuesday morning.
[01:25:30.089 --> 01:25:30.830]  Then it will end.
[01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:32.991]  And it is store-bought, free shipping, double Patriot Points.
[01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:36.193]  Black Friday comes early here in the first two weeks of November.
[01:25:36.213 --> 01:25:40.255]  We've been doing it for nine years now, and we have a lot of great products back in stock.
[01:25:41.348 --> 01:25:46.010]  We have sold out for more than two years back and improved even stronger, more concentrated and taste better.

[01:25:55.595 --> 01:25:57.135]  It really is next level superfood.
[01:25:57.676 --> 01:26:00.337]  And we went to top researchers and we said, what is the best thing to come up with?
[01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:02.250]  All right, folks.
[01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:04.509]  and they said this, made it even stronger.
[01:26:04.509 --> 01:26:08.150]   It's discounted at InfowarStore.com, despite the fact it's been sold out for years.

[01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.190]  It's back in stock, InfowarStore.com.
[01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:29.990]   All right, folks, Jay Dyer is coming up next segment, and I've got a correction to make.
[01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:35.910]   I got so many papers flying around, so much going on, that I saw articles last night and this morning
[01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:41.310]   where Australian ministers are saying, "We've got lockdowns for the unvaccinated coming."
[01:26:41.054 --> 01:26:45.699]  I mean, even last week I played a couple of their premiers of different states saying that.
[01:26:45.739 --> 01:26:49.723]  And we do have a new clip of one of their ministers saying similar things today.
[01:26:49.823 --> 01:26:51.085]  So I conflated that.
[01:26:51.685 --> 01:26:52.186]  I mixed it.
[01:26:53.405 --> 01:26:58.826]  With Austria saying they're going to lock people down who aren't vaccinated.
[01:26:58.846 --> 01:26:59.986]  Because it's all you and run.
[01:27:00.046 --> 01:27:03.567]  So things are so bad, even when I make a mistake, it's actually accurate.
[01:27:03.947 --> 01:27:04.987]  Because it's so widespread.
[01:27:05.007 --> 01:27:05.547]  But here it is.
[01:27:06.108 --> 01:27:12.689]  Aussie Health Chief says people who don't get vaccinated will be miserable, lonely for life.
[01:27:15.429 --> 01:27:16.070]  And locked down.
[01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:17.670]  And it's the same thing out of Austria.
[01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:22.584]  They used a government corruption probe to get rid of the populist president.
[01:27:23.145 --> 01:27:26.426]  Austrian lockdown for the vaccinated is days away, Chancellor says.
[01:27:27.046 --> 01:27:28.647]  Reuters is reporting.
[01:27:30.668 --> 01:27:34.869]  So, I was reading in Australia where they were saying it, and I met someone who said, oh, Australia has a Chancellor?
[01:27:34.889 --> 01:27:35.770]  I thought they were a Prime Minister.
[01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:37.150]  I was like, oh, that must be the leader of their parliament.
[01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:39.831]  But I was wrong, but I was right.
[01:27:39.871 --> 01:27:41.672]  Things are so bad that I was right as well.
[01:27:42.398 --> 01:27:42.938]  That's what I mean.
[01:27:42.978 --> 01:27:43.638]  It's just global.
[01:27:43.678 --> 01:27:44.499]  It's all the same thing.
[01:27:45.119 --> 01:27:53.822]  And what you see in Spain and Austria and Germany and the UK and the United States... Yeah, there it is.
[01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.023]  Austria locked down for unvaxxed.
[01:27:56.543 --> 01:27:58.124]  Israel holds COVID war games.
[01:27:59.176 --> 01:28:00.396]  Record German cases.
[01:28:00.936 --> 01:28:05.138]  Despite all the injections and all the garbage and all the crap, it's made up.
[01:28:05.518 --> 01:28:07.578]  Oh, there's a real virus, but the tests are frauds.
[01:28:07.638 --> 01:28:08.418]  PCR test.
[01:28:08.919 --> 01:28:12.199]  Now they've got a Soros, Bill Gates-owned blood test they're gonna make you do.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.621]  I mean, this is martial law and all these people go, Jones, just go along with it and we'll move on.
[01:28:17.661 --> 01:28:18.541]  Just take your shot.
[01:28:18.601 --> 01:28:19.321]  It protects you.
[01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:20.782]  Oh, it doesn't protect you.
[01:28:20.822 --> 01:28:21.822]  You gotta take more shots.
[01:28:23.772 --> 01:28:29.236]  Here's the Aussie health minister says people who don't get vaccinated will be miserable and lonely for life.
[01:28:29.836 --> 01:28:38.802]  The Queensland president of the Australian Medical Association said during a television appearance that people still refusing to get the vaccine will be miserable, lonely for the rest of their lives.
[01:28:39.502 --> 01:28:40.783]  Oh, he's gonna hold you hostage.
[01:28:41.384 --> 01:28:42.865]  It sticks the needle in its skin.
[01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:45.646]  Or it goes back in the hole again.
[01:28:45.706 --> 01:28:46.127]  Here it is.
[01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:48.321]  That's a great play from the Premier.
[01:28:48.341 --> 01:28:49.303]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:28:50.104 --> 01:28:53.790]  You have to try and get people to lose something in order to get something.
[01:28:54.972 --> 01:29:01.002]  And look, there are going to be dramas I'm sure, especially around the Gold Coast area, but there's only really one decision for people to make.
[01:29:03.442 --> 01:29:04.723]  Oh, they're crazy enough to get vaccinated.
[01:29:04.783 --> 01:29:07.105]  Life would be miserable without being vaccinated.
[01:29:07.506 --> 01:29:23.040]  You won't be able to hide, you won't be able to get a doctor to sign off that you've got an exclusion because there's quite set rules on that and doctors will be audited to see if every one of their exclusions will be looked at very carefully.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.741]  They'll get fined, they can get struck off.
[01:29:25.782 --> 01:29:29.886]   The patients who tell Lies can be charged with fraud.
[01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:35.853]  There's a whole pile of issues, a whole pile of problems if you try and get around the system.
[01:29:36.514 --> 01:29:39.377]  It's going to be very hard to maintain your employment if you're not vaccinated.
[01:29:40.058 --> 01:29:42.220]  You won't be able to go anywhere for any entertainment.
[01:29:43.281 --> 01:29:44.802]  So by all means, get vaccinated.
[01:29:44.822 --> 01:29:51.007]  You've got another week where you can get double vaccinated before the 15th, the 17th of December when it's definitely coming in.
[01:29:51.708 --> 01:29:55.311]  And there'll be proof that you've been vaccinated, firm proof.
[01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:58.093]  You'll be asked to show going into most venues.
[01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:04.218]  So get vaccinated, otherwise you're going to have a very, very lonely life and you're not going to be able to maintain your employment.
[01:30:06.448 --> 01:30:07.369]  Well, there you go.
[01:30:07.429 --> 01:30:10.450]  So whether it's Austria or Australia, it's all the same.
[01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:20.336]  And I got the clip again last week where the actual governor, I guess they call them premiers, in one of the states is like, you'll be locked up, coming soon this Christmas.
[01:30:20.816 --> 01:30:22.037]  You won't be allowed out if you don't have it.
[01:30:22.898 --> 01:30:24.659]  And if we catch you outside your house, we're going to arrest you.
[01:30:25.459 --> 01:30:26.240]  And we'll take your house.
[01:30:27.165 --> 01:30:28.847]  So it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:28.947 --> 01:30:30.929]  And you see, I told you, you take the shot.
[01:30:30.989 --> 01:30:31.629]  Oh, it didn't work.
[01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:32.330]  There's more shots.
[01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:34.752]  But it does attack the ovaries and the testicles.
[01:30:35.053 --> 01:30:36.414]  And it does create cancer.
[01:30:36.634 --> 01:30:38.996]  And it does turn off your white blood cells that attack cancer.
[01:30:40.197 --> 01:30:42.139]  And all these idiots are going to take it.
[01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:43.501]  And they're going to slowly get sick and die.
[01:30:43.541 --> 01:30:45.422]  And society is going to collapse.
[01:30:45.462 --> 01:30:48.525]  And that's how you get a post-industrial world by the year 2030.
[01:30:49.801 --> 01:30:52.785]  Like the UN said they would do back in 1992 under world treaty.
[01:30:53.186 --> 01:30:55.228]  There's a world treaty to do all this.
[01:30:55.749 --> 01:30:59.454]  A world treaty to cut your energy off and shoot you up with poison and kill you.
[01:31:00.355 --> 01:31:04.441]  And I guess people just want to roll over and let them murder you and murder your children.
[01:31:05.262 --> 01:31:05.863]  Unbelievable.
[01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:10.344]  It comes at the end of October every year and only runs for two weeks.
[01:31:10.744 --> 01:31:15.225]  It's what I call the Black Friday comes early super blowout sale.

[01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:58.423]  It's all available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:58.463 --> 01:32:01.064]  The Black Friday sale comes early.
[01:32:01.324 --> 01:32:04.925]  It's going right now for the next two weeks and it supports the InfoWar.
[01:32:05.165 --> 01:32:06.626]  Take action now and get prepared.
[01:32:07.846 --> 01:32:13.268]  Isolate, contain and control, and then abuse.
[01:32:15.148 --> 01:32:20.170]  Isolate, then contain and control, then abuse or kill.
[01:32:21.175 --> 01:32:27.937]  That's been the model of oppressors and tyrants and cults since human history began to be recorded over 7,000 years ago.
[01:32:29.257 --> 01:32:40.401]  And now here we are today with the Davos Group representing the most powerful corporations on earth, the most powerful families, including royalty, literally saying they're setting up a world government to depopulize.
[01:32:41.541 --> 01:32:47.943]  Literally teaching children that they are non-essential and that they can't have running water or electricity.
[01:32:48.784 --> 01:32:59.745]   That's what Obama went to Africa Six years ago before he left office and told them on record, these are the greatest oppressors the world has ever seen.
[01:33:00.166 --> 01:33:01.467]  They don't care about the environment.
[01:33:02.007 --> 01:33:10.915]  When you read deeper into their documents, they're basically mad scientists or transhumanists that believe they're going to transcend carbon-based life and overwrite the entire planet.
[01:33:11.575 --> 01:33:13.417]  This is delusions of grandeur.
[01:33:13.757 --> 01:33:16.580]  All of the top Davos high priests are called high priests.
[01:33:18.214 --> 01:33:24.940]  And they say that they are transcending humanity and that they're going to basically absorb us in that transformation.
[01:33:25.781 --> 01:33:34.429]  The lockdowns, the vaccine passports are all the global social credit score world tracking system they've now announced a month ago.
[01:33:35.129 --> 01:33:37.572]  I told you decades ago this was coming because it was in their documents.
[01:33:37.592 --> 01:33:39.594]  Now it's not theoretical.
[01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:47.874]  It's gone from beta to operational and it doesn't matter whether you're a conservative, it doesn't matter whether you're a liberal, a Christian, a Buddhist, an atheist.
[01:33:48.194 --> 01:34:09.501]   This is a scientific dictatorship taking over and targeting you and you need to get out of the prison of the mind that you let them build for you, out of the constructs and break free and transcend and get back to your human roots and use your basic instincts in you With your intellect to decide that you are not going to be a slave of this and you're taking control of your destiny.
[01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:18.168]  Coming in December, I'm going to release the most powerful information ever, not just from Alex Jones, but period, when it comes to transcending tyranny.
[01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:21.812]  You'll find more information at BandOfVideo and InfoWars.com.
[01:34:22.232 --> 01:34:26.335]  If you are watching this transmission, never forget, you are the hope of the universe.
[01:34:26.396 --> 01:34:27.416]  You are the seed of the universe.
[01:34:27.617 --> 01:34:29.617]  You are the resistance.
[01:34:29.617 --> 01:34:37.617]  [Music]
[01:34:37.617 --> 01:34:41.617]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:49.321]  He is a best-selling author, a great researcher, and is even more up to speed on globalist documents than I am.
[01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:59.934]  And he joins us to talk about why the elite controllers are obsessed with Satanism, Luciferianism, the occult, paganism they're bringing back in the world today.
[01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.334]  And I told you I'd get to this earlier.
[01:35:01.374 --> 01:35:01.854]  We will.
[01:35:02.315 --> 01:35:04.095]  How wokeism is a new religion.
[01:35:04.155 --> 01:35:05.496]  The left even admits it is.
[01:35:06.156 --> 01:35:11.378]  And Klaus Schwab says tomorrow he's announcing the new world religion called the Great Narrative.
[01:35:12.018 --> 01:35:19.061]  So we're going to be getting to all of this and extinction rebellion and what this system wants and what it's doing.
[01:35:20.290 --> 01:35:25.555]  But it's just good old-fashioned Moloch worship of 3,000 years ago brought back again.
[01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:42.992]  But I thought, because it dovetails so well, we play a short three-minute report that Greg Reese filed yesterday that's at Man.Video, that's so important, dealing with the fact that this is the overwrite of the Christian ethos with the ethos of absolute barbarism and the Jacobins, you know them as Satanists.
[01:35:43.012 --> 01:35:44.012]  Here it is.
[01:35:44.012 --> 01:35:51.012]  [Music]
[01:35:51.012 --> 01:35:57.012]   Healthy society is built upon the balance between competition and cooperation,
[01:35:57.012 --> 01:36:02.012]  where cooperation is often simply not harming each other.
[01:36:02.829 --> 01:36:09.772]  Today's laws, based on Christian ideology, compel us to restrain our animal selves.
[01:36:10.952 --> 01:36:13.814]  Satanism is the opposition to this balance.
[01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:20.993]  It seeks to destroy Christian ideology so that the law is written by the ruthless.
[01:36:21.813 --> 01:36:24.855]  Because ruthlessness is their only advantage.
[01:36:26.055 --> 01:36:31.818]  In a healthy society, those who seek to feed off of others are forced into hiding.
[01:36:32.598 --> 01:36:34.739]  But today, they are hiding no more.
[01:36:35.439 --> 01:36:45.289]   After decades of it being injected into pop culture media, We are becoming all too familiar with the satanic rituals these miscreants love to celebrate.
[01:36:46.751 --> 01:36:54.222]  Whatever actually happened at Travis Scott's Astro World Festival, it was clearly designed as a satanic ritual.
[01:36:55.965 --> 01:36:59.326]  There are different names of gods who demand human sacrifice.
[01:37:00.066 --> 01:37:02.366]  But Moloch has been the most popular.
[01:37:03.106 --> 01:37:12.989]  And we can see the obvious depiction at Astroworld, where people could symbolically volunteer to ritually sacrifice themselves into the mouth of Moloch.
[01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:18.190]  But the real symbolism can be seen on stage.
[01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:24.711]  The spiraling portal, with non-human entities and flames emerging from it.
[01:37:26.181 --> 01:37:36.346]  The same ritual we've seen at the Gothard Base Tunnel Opening Ceremony in 2016, where a portal was opened and demonic entities were unleashed.
[01:37:37.306 --> 01:37:40.208]  The same ritual made famous by Aleister Crowley.
[01:37:40.968 --> 01:37:42.449]  The birth of the Antichrist.
[01:37:43.449 --> 01:37:44.830]  The Amalantra working.
[01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:48.512]  The cross being fed into the portal of hell.
[01:37:50.006 --> 01:37:54.410]  In other words, the death and destruction of humanity as we know it.
[01:37:55.271 --> 01:37:55.792]  The cull.
[01:37:56.653 --> 01:37:57.473]  Depopulation.
[01:37:58.254 --> 01:38:01.517]  Eight people died and dozens were rushed to the hospital.
[01:38:02.678 --> 01:38:05.261]  With at least 11 suffering from heart attacks.
[01:38:06.842 --> 01:38:08.864]  Victims as young as nine years old.
[01:38:10.126 --> 01:38:12.828]  Videos show several people having seizures.
[01:38:13.914 --> 01:38:22.759]  A security guard claims that someone stuck him with a syringe, and rumors have resulted that people were drugged.
[01:38:23.679 --> 01:38:31.363]  But isn't it more likely, given that these are the same reactions we have been seeing from the experimental jabs, that they are one and the same?
[01:38:32.524 --> 01:38:38.807]  Statistically speaking, if you get enough of the vaxxed in one place, injuries like this will occur.
[01:38:39.888 --> 01:38:42.910]  The entire world has become rife with human sacrifice.
[01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:48.232]  And these rituals are likely meant to give themselves the illusion of legitimacy.
[01:38:48.972 --> 01:38:53.573]  But they are merely the rotten parasites in an otherwise humane world.
[01:38:55.274 --> 01:39:00.176]  The real concern is that their anti-human culture is going mainstream.
[01:39:01.836 --> 01:39:08.836]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:39:08.836 --> 01:39:23.836]   Satanic rituals and human sacrifice at the Travis Scott AstroWorld Festival.
[01:39:24.257 --> 01:39:26.740]  Find the report at Bandod Video in the Gregory section.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:31.124]  It needs to be seen by young people so they know what you're dealing with.
[01:39:32.305 --> 01:39:35.729]  All right, joining us is Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[01:39:35.949 --> 01:39:36.830]  YouTube Jay Dyer.
[01:39:37.808 --> 01:39:42.230]  He is an author, comedian, TV presenter known for his deep analysis of Hollywood, geopolitics, and culture.
[01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:44.991]  His graduate work focused on psychological warfare in film.
[01:39:45.411 --> 01:39:50.833]  He's an author of two books, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, and the co-creator, co-host, television show Hollywood Decoded.
[01:39:50.853 --> 01:39:52.473]  And he joins us now.
[01:39:52.533 --> 01:39:54.254]  Jay, great to have you here with us.
[01:39:54.914 --> 01:39:59.936]  Let's start getting into what really happened last weekend and where this is going in your view.
[01:40:01.627 --> 01:40:12.073]  Yeah, well, I'm glad that you played the Gregg Reese clip because the first thing I saw when I started looking into this was the similarities to the Gotthard Tunnel event.
[01:40:12.393 --> 01:40:20.517]  And for anybody that's skeptical, you know, this is a pattern that we've seen all the way back to the Super Bowl ceremonies, you know, the halftime shows.
[01:40:20.897 --> 01:40:29.420]   This is a consistent pattern where they will intentionally interject occult, esoteric, and now openly satanic imagery.
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:33.019]   And if anybody doubts it, I mean, I'm starting to notice a turn
[01:40:33.019 --> 01:40:38.380]   where people are maybe previously skeptical, but after this event, a lot of people are saying,
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.859]   "Hey, wait a minute. This looks like maybe there's something to this."
[01:40:40.859 --> 01:40:43.579]   Even breaking into the mainstream media, they're admitting that,
[01:40:43.579 --> 01:40:47.659]   "Hey, you know, Newsweek had a thing saying, 'Hey, it looks like there's probably actually something
[01:40:47.659 --> 01:40:48.378]  going on here.'"
[01:40:48.378 --> 01:40:50.619]  Well, sure. I mean, Lil Nas having sex with the devil.
[01:40:50.619 --> 01:40:52.698]  I mean, all of this. It's a full-on assault.
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:41:00.460]   Yeah, and I want to keep in mind, too, that, as you know, if you go back to the Lucis Trust, the UN,
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:04.859]   you know, they promoted this new religion, this new Aeon, decades ago.
[01:41:05.078 --> 01:41:09.239]  Alice Bailey wrote that book, Externalization of the Hierarchy, that you referenced quite a bit.
[01:41:09.279 --> 01:41:21.111]   And if you look in that book, she says, That really the goal of all of this is a new world religion, a new religion that will be amenable to earth worship, to the green agenda basically.
[01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:25.270]   So really a lot of this, and I'm not saying there aren't people that don't take it seriously,
[01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:28.470]   some of them do take it very seriously, the satanic elements of it, but there's another
[01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:33.770]   layer to which it's just another tool of social engineering and control to denigrate and to
[01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:37.389]  ritually, they use the word, brutalize the public.
[01:41:37.389 --> 01:41:41.350]  And what that does is it puts us into a catatonic state.
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:46.751]   It's a form of trauma that they use through mass media to really just denigrate people.
[01:41:46.751 --> 01:41:51.331]   And according to some of the satanists themselves, they see these rituals as ways to put people
[01:41:51.331 --> 01:41:57.530]   into a lower frequency, a lower vibration to where they can't think beyond the basic
[01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:58.930]  pleasure drives, the basic--
[01:41:58.930 --> 01:42:02.570]   Exactly, they bring you lower than the third dimension so you can be programmed.
[01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:12.570]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:42:03.702 --> 01:42:07.164]  Yeah, basically turning them into beasts to be part of the beast system.
[01:42:07.584 --> 01:42:14.508]  You bestialize the population to make them a willing, you know, willingly complicit in the beast system.
[01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:20.392]  And look at this footage of all these so-called elites going to be part of these public satanic ceremonies now.
[01:42:20.752 --> 01:42:21.712]  Like they're all powerful.
[01:42:21.752 --> 01:42:22.453]  These are losers.
[01:42:24.284 --> 01:42:30.348]  Yeah, a lot of these people, you know, even in the artwork itself, it tells them that they will not go into the future.
[01:42:30.368 --> 01:42:33.890]  You know, Madonna just did a Eurovision thing a year before COVID.
[01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:38.533]  And at that ceremony, she dressed up in a bunch of robes and it was this big ritual.
[01:42:39.233 --> 01:42:44.017]  And the song that she did was, none of you will go into the future or something like that.
[01:42:44.077 --> 01:42:45.457]  Not everybody's going into the future.
[01:42:45.517 --> 01:42:48.219]  You can't go into the future unless you're part of this agenda.
[01:42:48.659 --> 01:42:50.280]  It's literally in the lyrics of the song.
[01:42:50.721 --> 01:42:56.125]   It was, Not everyone is coming in the future, not everyone is going to last.
[01:42:56.585 --> 01:42:57.146]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:42:57.686 --> 01:43:02.171]  And basically, there's gas masks, people wearing gas masks all around here, which is very odd, right?
[01:43:02.211 --> 01:43:06.455]  A year before, this was 2018 or 19, before all this stuff broke out.
[01:43:06.475 --> 01:43:10.239]  Well, they even had a fashion show called COVID-19 in France.
[01:43:10.699 --> 01:43:11.921]  I mean, it's all in our face.
[01:43:13.502 --> 01:43:20.725]  Yeah, and we know from the, you know, Spars, the Klaydaks, the Crimson Contagion, that this was an ore game that had been playing a long time.
[01:43:20.745 --> 01:43:29.129]  So I think we really do see a lot of coordination between these, you know, controlled megastars and the top-down, you know, Klaus Schwab system.
[01:43:29.289 --> 01:43:31.430]  They're all promoting the same thing, and it goes all the way back 50 years.
[01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:46.003]  To Alice Bailey and the United Nations promoting the new Aquarian, the new age, you know, decades before the hippies and, you know, hate Asper and... And she's showing in New York destroyed and everyone nerve gassed and so they're getting ready for that.
[01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:52.016]  Yeah, and keep in mind, too, this is about brutalizing the youth.
[01:43:52.656 --> 01:43:54.097]  You know, everybody's upset.
[01:43:54.117 --> 01:43:56.478]  I'm not trying to denigrate, you know, the people that died.
[01:43:56.518 --> 01:43:57.158]  That's terrible.
[01:43:57.238 --> 01:44:01.479]  But, you know, what Travis Scott is really there to do is to market towards kids.
[01:44:01.519 --> 01:44:03.860]  He's actually marketed towards 8 to 12 year olds.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.401]  Just like Lil Nas.
[01:44:05.801 --> 01:44:06.301]  Absolutely.
[01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:16.672]  Yeah, and so this is the ceremony of the destruction of innocence that the Krolians talked about, and you'll notice there that imager of Moloch there, where he actually, he eats the kids.
[01:44:16.712 --> 01:44:18.893]  He's chewing up and eating your kids, digesting them.
[01:44:18.913 --> 01:44:23.954]  And this is the promo stuff they put out, and in no wonder that's what ended up happening.
[01:44:24.374 --> 01:44:25.555]  Stay right there, Jay Dyer.
[01:44:26.315 --> 01:44:36.266]   It was the Lucius Trust that funded the UN prayer room in New York City, and the Lucis Trust has got their address there at 666.
[01:44:36.586 --> 01:44:45.869]  And they also funded Common Core and Fuzzy Math, and they're funding the move in California to get rid of advanced math and other studies.
[01:44:46.349 --> 01:44:48.709]  They want dumbed-down, controllable people.
[01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:54.291]  In fact, in Endgame 2.0, there was a short film I did before Dr. Kaufman, who's in the film, died.
[01:44:55.447 --> 01:45:05.296]  He brings forward the documents showing in the 60s where they said we're going to bring back paganism and human sacrifice and teach people anti-science so that they're unable to ever stand up against us.
[01:45:07.358 --> 01:45:09.560]  Let the plan of love and light work out.
[01:45:10.561 --> 01:45:13.944]  And that's the Luciferians that are different from the Satanists.
[01:45:13.984 --> 01:45:17.528]  They create barbarous, murderous, evil groups that are selfish.
[01:45:18.428 --> 01:45:21.031]  That's a weapon that the Luciferians wield.
[01:45:21.758 --> 01:45:23.942]  But they see themselves as guardians of the universe.
[01:45:24.383 --> 01:45:25.805]  So Jay Dyer's a great researcher.
[01:45:26.226 --> 01:45:28.389]  Why don't you start with that and then get into what happened last weekend?
[01:45:29.111 --> 01:45:30.753]  It's really been a big wake-up call for people.
[01:45:31.354 --> 01:45:33.739]  Explaining eluciferian versus a satanist.
[01:45:36.175 --> 01:45:50.678]  Well, a lot of the satanic groups that are kind of publicly known, like the pop culture satanists, this is kind of an outer portico religion, the Anton LaVey kind of stuff, and that's kind of just a pop thing that probably has a lot of intelligence control.
[01:45:50.738 --> 01:45:56.457]   I think, if I recall, Anton LaVey himself worked for Interpol as a kind of an informant
[01:45:56.457 --> 01:45:57.778]  or an asset for a while.
[01:45:57.778 --> 01:46:03.057]   So a lot of these groups, especially cults, typically have this kind of front relationship
[01:46:03.057 --> 01:46:08.038]   to some intelligence agency or some kind of group that's, you know, fronting them.
[01:46:08.038 --> 01:46:11.577]   And then they kind of have concentric circles where you have, you know, more powerful entities
[01:46:11.577 --> 01:46:15.738]   on the inner core that kind of control these outer portico groups.
[01:46:15.738 --> 01:46:17.978]  And you know, a lot of things are structured that way.
[01:46:17.978 --> 01:46:22.777]   Societies, the mafia structure that way, organized crime, intelligence, they all have that same
[01:46:22.777 --> 01:46:23.777]  kind of structure.
[01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:27.898]   And a lot of people don't know kind of the inner handlers of these outer groups.
[01:46:28.232 --> 01:46:29.453]  And that's done on purpose.
[01:46:29.533 --> 01:46:36.995]  And so I think a lot of these rappers and a lot of these people who they may or may not take it seriously, but the people above them, some of them do.
[01:46:37.155 --> 01:46:41.517]  And then the people above them, really, it's ultimately pragmatic, right?
[01:46:41.537 --> 01:46:44.778]  They want to figure out ways to manipulate and control people.
[01:46:45.798 --> 01:46:54.943]  If you look at, for example, the concept art, you talk often about telling people ahead of time what they're going to do, and there's many reasons why they do that.
[01:46:55.003 --> 01:47:00.426]  They do that as a way to catatonically lobotomize people, to freak them out.
[01:47:00.966 --> 01:47:02.587]  Program the subconscious.
[01:47:03.672 --> 01:47:07.934]  Yeah, and also, there's a key element for the people that do take it seriously.
[01:47:08.435 --> 01:47:16.699]  They believe that a willing sacrifice is much more powerful than, you know, to do this illegitimately or to, you know, well, it's always illegitimate, you know what I mean?
[01:47:16.799 --> 01:47:20.441]  If I were to just kill somebody, it would be different than baiting them into it.
[01:47:20.501 --> 01:47:32.428]  If you watch the classic movie Wicker Man, you know, the whole point of that movie is that the... He's a pure good man and they trick him to come and then willingly die trying to save children at the end, then they set him up and kill him.
[01:47:33.405 --> 01:47:35.928]  Well, but they keep giving him clues, right?
[01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:49.006]  Throughout the whole movie they keep saying, you're the rabbit, you're the sacrifice, you're the one that's going to die, you're the John Barleycorn guy who's going to be roasted at the end, and he willingly goes into it consistently, not paying attention to the clues that they're telling him.
[01:47:49.617 --> 01:47:53.479]  And I think that that's viewed as a will, like a willed sacrifice.
[01:47:53.539 --> 01:47:54.319]  I'm willing to go on.
[01:47:54.339 --> 01:48:03.683]  So, in other words, in terms of the concept art, which is all just totally all-seeing eyes, portals to hell, as you said, it's Saturnalian imagery.
[01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:13.808]  There's even a concept art which has the roller coaster going into the portal with an all-seeing eye and people just tumbling down into the hole in the concept art for Astral World.
[01:48:14.228 --> 01:48:28.231]  And if you look at the guy who did the concept art for Astroworld, he previously did, for example, the Kardashians Christmas card, which has, you know, satanic imagery, has giant all-seeing eyes in the Christmas cards they send out.
[01:48:28.471 --> 01:48:34.712]  And I think that, again, the function of these people is to be culture toxifiers, culture controllers.
[01:48:35.252 --> 01:48:42.994]  And they even throw it in your face, in the art itself, all the time, because that makes you a willing sacrifice, a willing victim, a willing participant.
[01:48:43.832 --> 01:48:49.894]  And much more dangerous than the concert, as you pointed out, is what you talked about in the first hour.
[01:48:50.475 --> 01:48:53.576]  I mean, the real sacrifice of the youth is what they're about to do.
[01:48:54.096 --> 01:49:02.880]  And so they believe that this phoenix from the flame that you see there, that's that bird, that's the Ordo Alca, the phoenix that arises out of the ashes of the old civilization.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:07.041]  You know, Travis Scott has in his artwork all of this stuff about dystopia.
[01:49:07.161 --> 01:49:08.702]  He says the dystopia is now.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:12.204]  And the new world, we're going to need an escape plan.
[01:49:12.804 --> 01:49:20.935]  That mountain, he calls it Utopia Mountain, and it's the mountain that will be the civilization that emerges after the Great Cataclysm.
[01:49:21.115 --> 01:49:22.797]  That's his whole concept art.
[01:49:22.837 --> 01:49:29.655]   His whole recent thing is all about What exists now has to be destroyed, and the new Aeon has to come in.
[01:49:30.075 --> 01:49:38.899]  And again, a lot of these rappers, and this has been 20-30 years now, a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot of them are serious about their Satanism.
[01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:46.363]  They really believe they're going to be participating in this Aeon, that there's going to be a new civilization that's built after this great cataclysm, great reset, etc.
[01:49:47.363 --> 01:49:48.684]  You can go all the way back to the 90s.
[01:49:48.844 --> 01:49:57.927]  I remember when I was in high school, everybody liked the Memphis rap scene and the Memphis rap scene was one of the first to have openly satanic artists like the Triple Six Mafia and so forth.
[01:49:58.348 --> 01:50:00.629]  Some of whom are, you know, some of the biggest rappers out there, right?
[01:50:00.729 --> 01:50:01.449]  Juicy J, right?
[01:50:02.134 --> 01:50:17.915]  So, this is not new, and then Jay-Z took it to a new level, you know, about mid-2000s, where he openly started advocating Krolianism, wearing Krolian attire, you know, promoting the do without will, love under will, etc.
[01:50:19.356 --> 01:50:26.579]  So, rap, as you know, back to the 80s and 90s, the MTV executive said, was an intentional warfare weapon.
[01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:28.260]  It's a cultural warfare weapon.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:34.162]  And so they took gangster rap and turned it into a weapon to partly help destroy the black community.
[01:50:34.202 --> 01:50:37.083]  And we know that they did it on purpose because it's come out even in mainstream media.
[01:50:37.663 --> 01:50:40.946]  And again, the classic image of Moloch.
[01:50:40.966 --> 01:50:43.147]  The Bible says, give not your children to the fire of Moloch.
[01:50:43.187 --> 01:50:44.989]  Moloch's in the New and Old Testament.
[01:50:45.409 --> 01:50:50.533]  The mothers are leading their children in to be killed, into the mouth to be thrown into the fire.
[01:50:51.093 --> 01:50:54.376]  I mean, this is absolutely in your face.
[01:50:54.716 --> 01:50:56.618]  One hundred percent.
[01:50:57.438 --> 01:50:58.119]  That's what they're doing.
[01:50:58.982 --> 01:51:09.632]  Yes, and see you on the other side, which was one of the catchphrases of this tour, is, you know, you tumbling into the portal, most of you not making it, right?
[01:51:09.712 --> 01:51:20.061]  So if he sees you on the other side, it means that you are part of his other song, Escape Plan, which is how he's going to escape, he thinks, the coming cataclysm and be part of the utopia.
[01:51:20.481 --> 01:51:25.326]  These people literally believe that they're going to be part of the breakaway civilization utopia.
[01:51:25.787 --> 01:51:30.907]   Again, he's married to one of the Jenners, one of the Kardashians.
[01:51:30.907 --> 01:51:34.427]  So that's what all of these rituals are about.
[01:51:34.427 --> 01:51:40.466]   These rituals are about escaping the coming cataclysm and being in that satanic aeon.
[01:51:40.496 --> 01:51:43.177]  And I covered that satanist essay that I believe is real.
[01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:46.939]  You know, I covered that a couple weeks ago on Bandot Video for you guys.
[01:51:47.519 --> 01:51:50.001]  And that guy's essay says all of this stuff.
[01:51:50.301 --> 01:52:04.268]  He said, what, 20 years ago, maybe 10 years ago, 20 years, whenever it was that he wrote that, he said that these public pop performances are rituals to lower the thought processes of the minds of the masses.
[01:52:04.748 --> 01:52:13.839]  To where they can't think about God or anything above just base level desires so that they can be willing cattle sacrifices in the coming cataclysm.
[01:52:15.413 --> 01:52:18.957]  You're absolutely right, and I want to give people the rest of the story, and I know you know it.
[01:52:19.497 --> 01:52:23.321]  When we come back, there is a cataclysm coming, and it's the fall of these people.
[01:52:23.782 --> 01:52:28.246]  They're trying to spin it that, oh, they're about to get rid of the old bad order and bring in a new order.
[01:52:28.286 --> 01:52:33.131]  No, this is the death of their old order, and God Christ's new order is coming.
[01:52:33.492 --> 01:52:35.574]  And they know it, and they can feel it, and they can see it.
[01:52:36.094 --> 01:52:37.094]  God-consciousness.
[01:52:37.575 --> 01:52:38.595]  Humanity going to the next level.
[01:52:38.615 --> 01:52:39.655]  That's what they're trying to suppress.
[01:52:40.055 --> 01:52:43.756]  The chemicals, the poison hitting our children, everything, is their mad panic.
[01:52:44.077 --> 01:52:46.177]  And it'll be all the Satanists that are actually destroyed.
[01:52:46.577 --> 01:52:47.197]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:47.237 --> 01:52:47.678]  Stay with us.
[01:52:47.758 --> 01:52:48.858]  Infowars.com.
[01:52:48.898 --> 01:52:49.978]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:52:51.919 --> 01:52:53.219]  And I don't say this to brag.
[01:52:53.259 --> 01:52:54.240]  I don't say this to be cool.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:57.821]  But I tried to have Luciferians recruit me when I was a very young teenager.
[01:52:59.201 --> 01:53:01.242]  And then I had Hollywood try to recruit me.
[01:53:01.922 --> 01:53:05.303]  And the stuff people know about me in Hollywood, it's not even one-tenth of the stuff, okay?
[01:53:05.942 --> 01:53:08.284]  I got taken to the top of it and it was actually the bottom of it.
[01:53:08.944 --> 01:53:10.385]  I felt no presence of God.
[01:53:11.046 --> 01:53:13.047]  You could put a gun to my head, I wouldn't join these people.
[01:53:13.448 --> 01:53:16.370]  Because I've got the Holy Spirit and I'm not on some power trip either, I'm just saying.
[01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:27.138]  But when you hear them thinking they're being empowered, look at Lil Nas, look at Travis Scott, look at Aleister Crowley, look at Madonna, she's a freaking joke.
[01:53:28.288 --> 01:53:30.510]  They know their evil system's coming to an end.
[01:53:30.810 --> 01:53:32.311]  They know they're going to be destroyed.
[01:53:32.651 --> 01:53:34.132]  They know God doesn't like them.
[01:53:34.193 --> 01:53:35.173]  They know they're filthy.
[01:53:35.514 --> 01:53:36.975]  God sees them as filth.
[01:53:38.176 --> 01:53:39.917]  They stink to high heaven spiritually.
[01:53:41.218 --> 01:53:55.849]  And so they want to claw as many of us as they can with them, and they're pushing all this as if this is enlightening a bunch of stupid weirdos doing, again, a simulated march of pall-bearing humanity into a furnace.
[01:53:56.698 --> 01:54:00.848]  And then trying to worship Madonna, this washed up joke.
[01:54:01.329 --> 01:54:02.471]  And that's what they do everywhere.
[01:54:02.511 --> 01:54:04.375]  These people are a joke!
[01:54:05.996 --> 01:54:16.482]  But the horrible inbred royalty and the Saxe-Coburg Gothas and the Rothschilds and the rest of them are so hellishly unhappy that they just love seeing everybody else miserable like they are.
[01:54:16.922 --> 01:54:22.825]  Because even though they're demonically possessed, their cells are a human body that was made by God.
[01:54:23.165 --> 01:54:26.707]  And so their very bodies are rebelling against them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:28.708]  That's why they're so physically ugly.
[01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:35.731]   And that's why they want to hurt us, is they want to pull us down to the level That they are at.
[01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:39.654]  Because we're fallen, but they're really fallen, spiritually completely.
[01:54:40.034 --> 01:54:44.278]  They've chosen it, and that's why all that flows from them is death and destruction and pain.
[01:54:44.318 --> 01:54:49.642]  I mean, you look at their high priest and priests, they are just weak sacks of filth.
[01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:56.548]  And that's what you worship is weakness and stupidness and shallowness and patheticness.
[01:54:57.268 --> 01:55:01.592]  And it's just absolutely the cult of losers.
[01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:08.754]  So we know that this multi-thousand-year-old, ten-thousand-year-old satanic world order is coming to an end.
[01:55:08.854 --> 01:55:20.679]  They know it, we know it, and so they're targeting us with poison and toxins and everything else they can to try to lower us inter-dimensionally, this is in their own words, to below even the third dimension.
[01:55:20.939 --> 01:55:35.391]   That's what the metaverse is, is a false synthetic universe, a lower dimension, that they're trying to artificially capture us in, a digital hell, a matrix, To try to keep us from the transcendence that's now beginning and accelerating.
[01:55:35.411 --> 01:55:41.578]  We're electrochemical energy creatures, quantum physics it all proves it, they know this, that exist in all dimensions.
[01:55:41.998 --> 01:55:54.229]   So this body is only an expression of our incredible higher dimensional power to then in the third dimension organize matter and energy into a Connectedness that is a form of time travel.
[01:55:54.849 --> 01:55:55.889]  Now that's the big secret.
[01:55:55.929 --> 01:56:00.190]  So at the CERN Superconducting Super Reactor Collider, they want to open a gate, they say.
[01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:02.671]  Sheba, the god of, you know, everything is there.
[01:56:03.011 --> 01:56:07.652]  And all this occultism, you know, at the tunnel, and then all the kids get killed in the crash.
[01:56:07.732 --> 01:56:09.232]  And it's always the same.
[01:56:09.552 --> 01:56:15.094]  And oh, going to the Great Pyramid and conjuring a grey alien that tells him, I'll make you a god, just kill everyone.
[01:56:15.614 --> 01:56:18.055]  Help me kill everyone and then you'll be given enlightenment.
[01:56:18.315 --> 01:56:22.177]   And then, and then, Arthur C. Clarke writes his books with the same story over and over again.
[01:56:22.457 --> 01:56:25.679]  They're telling you this, but they're really just pervert pedophiles.
[01:56:25.939 --> 01:56:38.468]  They're really just fallen scum that made a deal with the lowest creatures in the universe, that chose to be away from God but have free will, and so they can trick us to choose to join them with our free will as well.
[01:56:38.768 --> 01:56:42.470]   So just as CERN is the portal, They are now opening the portal.
[01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:44.590]  They open the portal in our minds.
[01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:45.691]  That's how powerful we are.
[01:56:45.711 --> 01:56:49.572]  And they're trying to suppress the fact that the true New Age is coming.
[01:56:49.872 --> 01:56:55.914]  So they're creating their false New Age, an artificial collapse, they say, because they know a collapse is coming.
[01:56:56.074 --> 01:56:59.496]  So they want to have an artificial one they control to try to survive themselves.
[01:56:59.776 --> 01:57:01.756]  They are loser failures.
[01:57:02.017 --> 01:57:02.977]  Please continue, Jay Dyer.
[01:57:04.955 --> 01:57:13.104]  Well, if you think about some of the other big rappers, again, there's an image of A$AP Rocky, who is a pretty well-known rapper in the last 10 years.
[01:57:13.344 --> 01:57:14.806]  And I mean, he's openly done.
[01:57:14.826 --> 01:57:16.768]  I don't think those are promotional images.
[01:57:16.848 --> 01:57:20.712]  I mean, him and his gang, they literally, you know, they're there doing.
[01:57:21.813 --> 01:57:38.805]  I don't know if it's Golden Dawn or what kind of rituals they're doing, but they're doing the magic rituals openly for everyone to see, and then playing like, oh, you know, we don't really take this seriously, but then, oh, actually, maybe we do, because they, you know, oftentimes they divulge the fact that they take it seriously.
[01:57:38.865 --> 01:57:42.848]  So, really, at that level, it doesn't, they're not the main players.
[01:57:42.868 --> 01:57:50.033]  There's people way above them that, you know, have the real power and the real money, and that's why this is, again, a cultural weapon.
[01:57:50.786 --> 01:58:03.069]  And it's like you've been saying this last year, and you've said it so often that it just really clicked with me the other day that if you understand that what's happening is a warfare, then everything suddenly makes sense, right?
[01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:08.510]  It suddenly makes sense why they would want to, you know, inoculate everyone, including infants.
[01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:12.690]  It makes sense why Biden would want to shut down the country, shut down the economy.
[01:58:13.011 --> 01:58:17.231]  It makes sense why there's, you know, just total degeneracy and satanic rap everywhere.
[01:58:17.511 --> 01:58:20.272]  It's because they're trying to destroy the existing order.
[01:58:21.211 --> 01:58:22.812]  Suddenly, now, that don't make sense, right?
[01:58:22.852 --> 01:58:29.334]  But if you don't have that playbook, then you're confused, you're lost, you're wandering in a maze, you're hoodwinked, right?
[01:58:29.434 --> 01:58:33.235]  But it's ironic that it's all out there in the open, right?
[01:58:33.275 --> 01:58:34.316]  It's all in our face.
[01:58:34.356 --> 01:58:39.178]  And they're trying to fire the God particle, proving there's interdimensionals and break dimensions.
[01:58:39.218 --> 01:58:45.940]  That's their main mission, because they've observed particles break dimensional systems and go from particles to waves.
[01:58:48.368 --> 01:58:51.671]  Right, I think that they intentionally hide a lot of that tech, as you know.
[01:58:51.852 --> 01:59:00.220]  And if you look at Brave New World, there's a section in the book where the world's socialist controller, he says that, yeah, we know there's higher metaphysical truths.
[01:59:00.561 --> 01:59:03.063]  We know that there's divinity and transcendence.
[01:59:03.504 --> 01:59:10.370]  We intentionally hide that from the masses because we don't want them to know the power that they have, that they would then be empowered.
[01:59:10.411 --> 01:59:11.692]  We have to dumb them down.
[01:59:12.375 --> 01:59:12.875]  We have to.
[01:59:13.656 --> 01:59:15.557]  That's what he explains in the book.
[01:59:15.597 --> 01:59:19.099]  There's Aldous actually telling you that that's intentional.
[01:59:19.119 --> 01:59:22.800]  And by the way, I forgot to mention, Travis Scott also did a Metaverse concert.
[01:59:23.521 --> 01:59:28.103]  There's the all-seeing eyes that are all over his concept art, too, by the way.
[01:59:28.824 --> 01:59:33.766]  He did a Metaverse concert for Fortnite, which, again, is the most popular game for 8- to 12-year-old, 13-year-olds.
[01:59:35.899 --> 01:59:43.602]  And in that Metaverse concert that's about 12 minutes long, he does a whole ritual where he basically becomes a giant.
[01:59:44.842 --> 01:59:53.166]  He does a concert and then he ascends into space and then he ascends out of time and space like Bowman going into the Stargate in 2001.
[01:59:54.881 --> 02:00:05.325]  And so the whole message of that ceremony, that ritual there in that Metaverse concert in Fortnite, is that he's a god among men, an Anunnaki.
[02:00:05.345 --> 02:00:08.106]  He actually references the Anunnaki in his songs quite often.
[02:00:08.506 --> 02:00:12.548]  And then he transcends into space and leaves the dimensions of the here and the now.
[02:00:12.568 --> 02:00:15.189]  So this is just promoting the idea to the youth, to kids.
[02:00:15.825 --> 02:00:26.733]  People playing Fortnite that, you know, they don't understand they're being programmed that the kids that are playing this game are the ones that are going to live to when they insert you into the matrix.
[02:00:27.214 --> 02:00:28.115]  And let's go further.
[02:00:28.515 --> 02:00:39.884]  Even the writers for Prometheus admit, oh, we believe this is a real Genesis story that aliens did this and that this really happened and that the engineers are just biological androids of a higher ascendant race to higher dimensions.
[02:00:40.144 --> 02:00:46.789]   But we need to kill everybody first to save, you know, to save The planet and then we'll be able to ascend once we learn to kill everybody.
[02:00:46.809 --> 02:00:49.251]  It's just these aliens just keep telling us to kill everybody.
[02:00:49.311 --> 02:00:50.112]  It's so liberal.
[02:00:50.132 --> 02:00:54.135]  Yeah, why do the clockwork elves always tell you to kill?
[02:00:54.195 --> 02:00:55.797]  I mean, this is Terrence McKenna, right?
[02:00:55.817 --> 02:01:00.701]  The guy who popularized this and he was, you know, somewhat into these esoteric philosophies himself.
[02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:07.166]  You know, he always said, well, we've just got to kill everybody because the mushroom says kill everybody and the elves told me to kill him.
[02:01:07.206 --> 02:01:11.390]  Now we're listening to people who are talking to demonic elves saying kill everybody.
[02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:12.270]  Literally.
[02:01:13.551 --> 02:01:14.952]  And it's not a joke, right?
[02:01:14.992 --> 02:01:17.614]  I mean, they really believe that they're speaking to these entities.
[02:01:17.634 --> 02:01:19.895]  Hold on, let's come back for a break and talk about that.
[02:01:19.915 --> 02:01:30.162]  But to explain, the ayahuasca rituals, DMT, all of it, most of the time a little elf talks to you, and then it says it really likes you, but you're good, you get to live, but can you set up a world government and kill everybody?
[02:01:30.222 --> 02:01:31.583]  Will you work with me to kill everybody?
[02:01:32.063 --> 02:01:33.284]  And that's because they're demons, folks.
[02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:37.867]  Well, the rappers are now, they're all into LSD, right?
[02:01:37.947 --> 02:01:42.289]  Remember back in the 2000s, that was the chronic, that's when rappers smoked weed, right?
[02:01:42.329 --> 02:01:46.450]  Now, the rappers, all they do is pills and trip acid, and they talk about it all the time.
[02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:47.570]  They sing songs about tripping.
[02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:58.954]  And tripping acid, all that kind of stuff, that's one of the easiest ways, DMT, the eye wash, all that's the easiest way to contact what you're talking about and have these experiences that they think are opening their third eye.
[02:01:59.334 --> 02:02:01.975]  You know, he uses this third eye image all the time, Travis Scott.
[02:02:02.815 --> 02:02:08.118]  And they think that they've been given this message, like you said, that they're going to ascend and that they're going to be part of this transhumanism.
[02:02:08.138 --> 02:02:13.440]  And it is, we've got to go to break, but it is opening the third eye so they can fry you permanently instead of transcend.
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:14.881]  They're frying your third eye.
[02:02:15.241 --> 02:02:16.222]  That's what Satanism is.
[02:02:16.242 --> 02:02:16.822]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:17.783]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:18.843 --> 02:02:20.504]  Listen to what music was like in the 40s and 50s.
[02:02:20.564 --> 02:02:29.808]  It didn't matter whether it was big band music or classical or country or any of that.
[02:02:29.968 --> 02:02:32.613]   It was all just Uplifting.
[02:02:33.453 --> 02:02:33.993]  Empowering.
[02:02:36.254 --> 02:02:37.674]  There were stories of good versus evil.
[02:02:39.214 --> 02:02:43.435]  And now it's just discordant, insane hallucinations.
[02:02:44.555 --> 02:02:50.116]  You know, I remember being on Joe Rogan's show like four years ago, five years ago now, I guess Trump had just gotten elected.
[02:02:51.336 --> 02:02:53.937]  And it was the first time I was on a show, but in front of them, for everybody, he hadn't had me on.
[02:02:53.957 --> 02:02:55.657]  It was episode 911.
[02:02:56.917 --> 02:02:58.798]  And it's 911th podcast.
[02:02:58.818 --> 02:03:00.358]  They really bury that, but it's still on YouTube.
[02:03:01.483 --> 02:03:13.788]  And I was explaining, hey, George Soros has paid with the CIA to weaponize the strains of marijuana to make it more hallucinogenic, to put people into a state of control and to create artificial schizophrenia.
[02:03:14.597 --> 02:03:15.758]  And he thought it was crazy then.
[02:03:15.798 --> 02:03:17.579]  Well, a couple years later, Joe's like, man, you're right.
[02:03:17.619 --> 02:03:18.459]  It's all over the news.
[02:03:18.499 --> 02:03:19.520]  People are schizophrenic now.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.581]  There's a lot of my friends have become schizophrenic.
[02:03:22.122 --> 02:03:23.883]  And then they go from that into hallucinogens.
[02:03:23.903 --> 02:03:25.744]  So, you know, and Joe's learning about this.
[02:03:25.984 --> 02:03:28.286]  He was like, oh, big psychedelic guy 10, 15 years ago.
[02:03:28.766 --> 02:03:31.367]  And then now he sees the effect on other weak minded people.
[02:03:31.768 --> 02:03:32.088]  Yes.
[02:03:33.129 --> 02:03:33.429]  Yes.
[02:03:33.749 --> 02:03:37.531]  LSD, peyote, mushrooms, all of that stuff.
[02:03:37.591 --> 02:03:45.838]   If you're in control of yourself and have a relationship with God, The Hopi Indians take it, and they don't really get demon possessed, and I'm not saying take it, okay?
[02:03:46.178 --> 02:03:48.280]  But I'm not gonna lie to people, I've taken it, alright?
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:51.261]  Years ago, a long time ago, when I was a teenager, I took quite a bit of it.
[02:03:51.842 --> 02:03:57.365]  And the point is, is that it definitely opens up all those gateways and that stuff, and it's very real.
[02:03:57.886 --> 02:04:00.067]  It destroys the veil between.
[02:04:00.667 --> 02:04:03.627]   But most people who are already subconscious and unconscious
[02:04:03.627 --> 02:04:09.346]   and into the occult, just through growing up in this culture, they don't even know they are,
[02:04:09.346 --> 02:04:13.106]   they literally have no idea they're stepping through into another dimension, that their brain is already
[02:04:13.106 --> 02:04:16.467]   in another dimension, and they're giving these entities control over your mind.
[02:04:16.467 --> 02:04:21.307]   And it's very, very, astralogy, I took a lot, but I've taken some of that stuff, okay?
[02:04:21.307 --> 02:04:27.787]   And it was definitely, in some of the cases, not of this world.
[02:04:28.015 --> 02:04:39.838]  And that stuff's very real, ladies and gentlemen, and I can tell you, growing up, that I knew people that worked in research laboratories, separately, in San Francisco, for the government, with DRIP, DMT, and all of it.
[02:04:39.858 --> 02:04:40.999]  Remember I told Joe Rogan that?
[02:04:41.559 --> 02:04:44.100]  Years before it came out that universities were doing DRIP, DMT.
[02:04:45.191 --> 02:04:49.334]  And they came out right after I announced it because it was classified and they went ahead and released it.
[02:04:49.995 --> 02:04:52.977]  And so this is all very occultic, all very esoteric.
[02:04:53.338 --> 02:04:54.518]  I'm not involved in any of it.
[02:04:54.959 --> 02:04:56.600]  But like, it's weird metaphysically.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:57.461]  It's like I am though.
[02:04:57.781 --> 02:04:58.241]  You understand?
[02:04:58.281 --> 02:05:01.324]  It's like I'm at like the Illuminati level with these people.
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:08.104]  And I'm not saying we want to be at that level, but once you have awareness, you're where they are, except you're not going along with the plan.
[02:05:08.645 --> 02:05:13.328]  And so they'll just say, doesn't matter, you're already part of the plan because you know that supposedly you're with them.
[02:05:13.368 --> 02:05:19.132]  But that's a distinction between having being led by the Holy Spirit and being led by the spirit of this world.
[02:05:19.453 --> 02:05:21.074]  Jay, does that make any sense to what I'm saying?
[02:05:22.757 --> 02:05:22.997]  Sure.
[02:05:23.057 --> 02:05:26.418]  I mean, knowing about something doesn't mean that I willfully participated in it.
[02:05:26.579 --> 02:05:28.679]  So I think that's a fallacy there.
[02:05:28.699 --> 02:05:29.600]  That's a non-sequitur.
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:33.461]  It doesn't follow from the fact that I know about serial killers that I'm a serial killer, right?
[02:05:34.682 --> 02:05:38.983]  But I mean, there is a sense in which there is a kind of danger in that knowledge.
[02:05:39.023 --> 02:05:42.302]   yeah, I mean a lot of people I think might want to experiment with these things and I
[02:05:42.302 --> 02:05:47.823]   wouldn't recommend it because I've had those same experiences too, which can be pretty
[02:05:47.823 --> 02:05:48.823]  terrifying.
[02:05:48.823 --> 02:05:53.743]   So another thing to keep in mind too is that I think the Travis Scott event, this is not
[02:05:53.743 --> 02:05:55.382]  the first time this type of thing has happened.
[02:05:55.382 --> 02:05:59.262]   You had mentioned some other concerts and other places, big venues, Mecca, where people
[02:05:59.262 --> 02:06:04.342]   have been trampled, but let's not forget that there was the Altamont event, which the Rolling
[02:06:04.342 --> 02:06:08.663]   Stones at that time had, if I recall, had been recently introduced to people like Kenneth
[02:06:08.663 --> 02:06:10.663]  who himself was a Crowley.
[02:06:10.401 --> 02:06:16.242]  And one of the things that Anger always promoted was doing performance art, doing avant-garde art as a ritual.
[02:06:16.883 --> 02:06:21.124]  So the idea that artists don't have that mindset is false, right?
[02:06:21.164 --> 02:06:21.704]  But they do.
[02:06:21.844 --> 02:06:22.704]  And this is... No, you're right.
[02:06:22.724 --> 02:06:27.546]   Before I studied what happened over the weekend, I said, oh, maybe Maybe it was just the artist, they didn't know.
[02:06:27.586 --> 02:06:31.409]  But now that I researched the people there, they knew this was a planned deal.
[02:06:31.949 --> 02:06:34.351]  They said, when we have dead bodies, we're going to call them Smurfs.
[02:06:34.691 --> 02:06:38.274]  Then on the shirt, it shows blue children going into a door.
[02:06:38.294 --> 02:06:42.677]  They come out red, meaning they've been transmuted into devils, basically.
[02:06:42.697 --> 02:06:44.939]  I mean, this looks like it was actually all premeditated.
[02:06:46.542 --> 02:06:53.265]  Yeah, you know, who knows to what degree the artists are, I mean, I don't know, but again, I think it's worth asking these questions.
[02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:58.627]  You know, there were, we do have again precedent in concerts of people being dosed, for example.
[02:06:58.667 --> 02:07:00.067]  That's happened in past concerts.
[02:07:00.107 --> 02:07:06.730]  The CIA was reportedly at some of those early 60s concerts passing out LSD to see what it would do.
[02:07:07.670 --> 02:07:10.612]  And think, for example, of the idea of the dead head, right?
[02:07:10.712 --> 02:07:14.194]  The idea of the dead bears and the dead skeletons as the idea.
[02:07:14.235 --> 02:07:15.215]  You're dead in the head.
[02:07:15.275 --> 02:07:22.940]  Well, Travis Scott has his own interesting symbolic image, which is kind of like a doll head or a kid's head with the eyes X'd out.
[02:07:23.941 --> 02:07:26.122]  And he uses that quite often in his concerts.
[02:07:26.202 --> 02:07:29.765]  And so, again, the artwork is just very ominous, very creepy.
[02:07:30.425 --> 02:07:35.288]  And we do have precedent for artists, you know, thinking that their events are rituals.
[02:07:35.348 --> 02:07:36.549]  They really do view it that way.
[02:07:38.442 --> 02:07:40.823]  So why is it building towards a crescendo?
[02:07:41.043 --> 02:07:41.924]  What are you expecting to do?
[02:07:41.944 --> 02:07:46.165]  I mean, obviously, the Great Reset is their attempt to collapse society while posing as the saviors.
[02:07:48.826 --> 02:07:59.391]  Yeah, I think that this probably, from his vantage point, you know, he probably thought that if it was something that was a ritual, that this would sort of mark his, I mean, he now will be famous for this, right?
[02:07:59.451 --> 02:08:00.191]  It's kind of a mark.
[02:08:00.231 --> 02:08:05.634]  I mean, I'm not trying to be, again, callous, but it's a marketing event, just like Altamont was for the Rolling Stones.
[02:08:05.654 --> 02:08:10.497]   People will I always remember this as like, you know, he'll probably be the biggest star in the world now.
[02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:13.179]  From the Vance's point of the world, they're going to promote this.
[02:08:13.219 --> 02:08:18.622]  They're going to, you know, he's going to be famous for even though right now it's scandalous and he's having to apologize.
[02:08:19.663 --> 02:08:26.768]  I mean, I think this was probably something that will seal his stardom for a long time, which is dangerous and scary.
[02:08:26.808 --> 02:08:33.473]   But like you said, this is the crescendo is that most of the people that are participating in the evil It comes back around.
[02:08:33.553 --> 02:08:37.736]  I mean, Bolsheviks, Stalin, I mean, these people get rid of their minions first.
[02:08:38.197 --> 02:08:39.498]  That's the first people they go for.
[02:08:39.658 --> 02:08:43.621]  So, you know, just because you have a lot of money doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be part of this.
[02:08:43.661 --> 02:08:57.112]  I think a lot of governors, a lot of people that are in power, a lot of these minions are going to be fed into the grinder just as much as the normies, the muggles, you know, the peasants that the stars think that they're above.
[02:08:58.153 --> 02:09:05.181]   I think they're all going to, you know, be You know, every man will get what he, eye for an eye, basically.
[02:09:05.461 --> 02:09:08.462]  God will render to each man according to his works, basically, is what I'm trying to say, so.
[02:09:09.142 --> 02:09:13.124]  You're absolutely right, and these people are just so incredibly pathetic.
[02:09:13.164 --> 02:09:18.526]  I mean, you look at the slaves of Satan, whether it's the Clintons or these people, they just look like hell.
[02:09:18.606 --> 02:09:26.890]  I mean, look at Soros, all of them, they're just, but they all have that in love with themselves look in their eye, like they're not there, because they're not there, they've been taken over.
[02:09:28.587 --> 02:09:58.468]   Well, there's a couple instances that Travis Scott was arrested for trying to get his Fans to riot to rage like he tries to get them to do mosh pit which is weird because I when I was growing up mosh pits were what heavy metal dudes did but now it's now rappers do mosh pits which is weird but I mean he tries to get them to destroy stuff and you know you know do these kinds of uh destructive things so again I think that that that he had a perfect recipe for getting these people into the scenario and it being hyped up he tries to tell people to do this stuff
[02:09:59.348 --> 02:10:07.333]  Um, and then, you know, there was a weird part in the concert where people had told him, and he did, to be fair, at one point say, watch out, there's an ambulance coming.
[02:10:07.893 --> 02:10:12.672]   There's one part where he just sort of bends over and starts heaving and looking up and smiling
[02:10:12.672 --> 02:10:20.212]   with this really weird sort of creepy smile on his face, which is supposedly after people had alerted him
[02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.693]  to the fact that people were dying.
[02:10:21.693 --> 02:10:25.853]   Oh yeah, they're having convulsions and dying in front of him and he's out on a cherry picker
[02:10:25.853 --> 02:10:28.853]   out over them like just going, ♪ Oh ♪
[02:10:28.853 --> 02:10:34.453]   Looking at the death with pleasure, singing so happy, going, "Oh yeah."
[02:10:34.453 --> 02:10:39.091]   There's a specific point where he bends over he sort of starts heaving and he looks up and he smiles
[02:10:39.091 --> 02:10:44.531]   with a really creepy looking So again, whether he knew that was going on, I don't know,
[02:10:44.531 --> 02:10:51.012]   but there's just too many things here, you know, that that Raise serious questions and it just makes me think of Altamont
[02:10:51.012 --> 02:10:56.342]   just makes me think of you know Marketing rituals from the vantage point of the elite the
[02:10:56.342 --> 02:10:58.811]  cult elite. They see it all as the same thing, right?
[02:10:58.811 --> 02:11:03.651]   A ritual is no different than mass marketing mass marketing is a ritual for them. Absolutely
[02:11:03.786 --> 02:11:11.349]  It's the projection of their will against us for us to kill each other and fall apart while the Luciferians sit back as the psychic bomb destroys us.
[02:11:11.469 --> 02:11:17.152]  Let's do five more minutes, Jay Dyer, and then we've got another great guest host about to take over, jaysanalysis.com.

[02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:40.413]  All right, final segment with Jay Dyer.
[02:12:40.673 --> 02:12:42.714]  I'll introduce our next guest coming up.
[02:12:43.214 --> 02:12:45.276]  But I wanted to get to this news with him.
[02:12:46.357 --> 02:12:47.738]  And I'll be covering this live tomorrow.
[02:12:47.758 --> 02:12:49.179]  He's going to give a speech while we're on air.
[02:12:49.199 --> 02:12:50.280]  I think it was at the third hour.
[02:12:50.841 --> 02:12:55.404]  Founder of the World Economic Forum, also head of the Bilderberg Group, announced his great narrative.
[02:12:55.444 --> 02:12:58.187]  He's not going to tell us, he says, until tomorrow, but we know what it is.
[02:12:58.787 --> 02:13:01.129]  It's the global greenhouse gas system.
[02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:05.493]  It's used the lockdowns that we already had to, quote, save the earth further.
[02:13:05.553 --> 02:13:07.254]  It's a global carbon tax.
[02:13:07.314 --> 02:13:11.918]  It's just their whole rollout that the world's terrible, the world's ugly, the world's bad.
[02:13:13.239 --> 02:13:26.752]  It's because you've been bad, and others have been bad, and the rich have been bad, but we're going to give you all a world social credit score and a world guaranteed basic income if you just get behind us and the $150 trillion every decade in carbon taxes.
[02:13:27.052 --> 02:13:28.334]  That's what he's going to announce tomorrow.
[02:13:28.654 --> 02:13:30.235]  Jay Dyer, you want to speak to that?
[02:13:30.275 --> 02:13:34.780]  Got any predictions about what he's going to say about the collaborative effort he's going to unveil tomorrow?
[02:13:36.266 --> 02:13:44.535]  Yeah, well, in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, one of the elements I picked up on, which I didn't expect, was kind of odd, was the consistent usage of the idea of a New Covenant.
[02:13:45.288 --> 02:13:50.752]  And he was using this religious language, which I thought was a little odd, but then the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.
[02:13:50.832 --> 02:13:59.319]  I mean, I think Klaus was very aware that to get the masses involved and on board, it's much easier to have an engineered, steered religion, right?
[02:13:59.439 --> 02:14:05.564]  As the ship that everybody jumps on to steer them into the portal that they want to take them down into hell.
[02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:19.640]   And, you know, Klaus said that this new covenant that will be, again, that's biblical language, the new covenant will be one where The new sins are confessing your eco-crimes, your carbon allotments, going over your carbon allotments.
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:20.741]  That's the new sin.
[02:14:20.781 --> 02:14:22.081]  Extinction Rebellion type stuff.
[02:14:22.101 --> 02:14:34.586]  So I think we can already postulate with quite a bit of certainty that this will be a religion based around eco-worship, the green agenda, and how really the problem for the planet is man himself.
[02:14:35.466 --> 02:14:41.510]  And in order to save the planet, right, our saviors are going to have to, you know, massively reduce the population, which they're doing right now.
[02:14:41.991 --> 02:14:43.192]  So that's exactly what it'll be.
[02:14:43.212 --> 02:14:43.632]  That's right.
[02:14:43.652 --> 02:14:45.113]  They're going to Pavlovian lean.
[02:14:45.879 --> 02:15:07.017]  Give people more on their social credit score and more on their universal income when they submit, when they push propaganda, when they get sterilized, when they sterilize their children, they're going to be rock stars doing this with all these different forms of human sacrifice, with Extinction Rebellion always attacking blue-collar trains and blue-collar highway areas and factories, again attacking the general public.
[02:15:08.178 --> 02:15:12.282]  This is the establishment not wanting us to, quote, eat up their resources.
[02:15:14.167 --> 02:15:26.270]  Yeah, somebody had sent me a clip where I think there was a, just to make an analogy here, Travis Scott had told a fan one time who had climbed up a thing, you know, jumped down and he jumped down and broke his leg or something like that.
[02:15:26.290 --> 02:15:39.593]  I don't know exactly what the case was, but the power of the system to just basically tell you to, you know, either risk your life or die for me is the power that, you know, Klaus and these people love.
[02:15:39.633 --> 02:15:40.493]  That's what they crave.
[02:15:40.513 --> 02:15:43.614]  So they're literally pushing an entire system of death.
[02:15:44.638 --> 02:15:47.919]  The new covenant, a covenant of death, actually, is what Isaiah talks about.
[02:15:48.019 --> 02:15:53.580]  That the wicked make a covenant with death, thinking that they're going to get life, and then what do you know, Satan tricks them.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:57.720]  But all along, right, you know, Satan has told you what he's going to do, right?
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:58.561]  He's a liar.
[02:15:59.041 --> 02:15:59.601]  He's a thief.
[02:15:59.701 --> 02:16:01.921]  He comes to steal, kill, and destroy, as Christ says.
[02:16:02.001 --> 02:16:09.143]  So, you know, this whole new religion is really just post-humanism and anti-natalism.
[02:16:09.283 --> 02:16:10.323]  That's the whole purpose of it.
[02:16:10.343 --> 02:16:10.983]  That's all it is.
[02:16:11.723 --> 02:16:18.228]  And they'll do anything they can to convince you to not have kids, to be sterile, to ultimately kill yourself.
[02:16:18.408 --> 02:16:19.749]  Yeah, just like Thulsa Doom.
[02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:22.511]  You always use that analogy, perfect analogy, right?
[02:16:22.551 --> 02:16:24.272]  Come to me, my child, come, come.
[02:16:24.893 --> 02:16:31.057]  That's exactly what the system is doing on a macro scale, and the pop stars just do it on a smaller scale.
[02:16:33.487 --> 02:16:34.568]  Well, well said, Jay.
[02:16:34.588 --> 02:16:37.912]  We really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you were able to come on the broadcast.
[02:16:37.932 --> 02:16:40.074]  I'm glad you host the 4th Hour sometime.
[02:16:40.094 --> 02:16:41.816]  You need to come visit us in Austin soon.
[02:16:41.836 --> 02:16:43.397]  We've got an open door for you and your wife.
[02:16:43.938 --> 02:16:46.301]  Again, we really appreciate all the fine work you're doing.
[02:16:46.321 --> 02:16:47.562]  30-second closing comment.
[02:16:49.398 --> 02:16:51.899]  I would just remind people, like you said, that this is a scam.
[02:16:51.939 --> 02:16:52.439]  It's a trick.
[02:16:52.499 --> 02:16:53.159]  It's a tool.
[02:16:53.259 --> 02:16:55.600]  It's obviously, on the face of it, evil, right?
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.281]  I mean, evil doesn't benefit you in the long run.
[02:16:58.321 --> 02:17:01.542]  There might be a short-term gain, but, you know, you always have to pay the price.
[02:17:02.162 --> 02:17:05.923]  And a lot of these people, you know, they're into forms of chaos magic.
[02:17:06.003 --> 02:17:09.825]  Chaos magic, in terms of where it is now, is about promoting transhumanism.
[02:17:10.665 --> 02:17:16.867]  You know, we just did an analysis of Manley P. Hall's book, and the reason I bring him up is that he's one of these writers and occultists that they all look to.
[02:17:17.527 --> 02:17:25.337]  And what's funny about Manly P. Hall is that he gives you all this esoteric stuff and then he ends it by saying, by the way, the solution is socialist world government.
[02:17:25.517 --> 02:17:26.158]  Follow the UN.
[02:17:26.478 --> 02:17:28.521]  So it's all just a tool for socialism.
[02:17:28.601 --> 02:17:30.403]  That's right, just to get us out of the way.
[02:17:30.443 --> 02:17:31.364]  It's a program to kill us.
[02:17:31.404 --> 02:17:31.825]  Thank you, Jay.
[02:17:36.263 --> 02:17:46.532]  It's now becoming accepted knowledge, accepted fact, that global government run by private corporations is taking over the United States and other formerly sovereign nations.
[02:17:46.972 --> 02:17:47.733]  They're being destroyed.
[02:17:48.113 --> 02:17:49.975]  All the checks and balances are being annihilated.
[02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:51.856]  Our borders are being destroyed.
[02:17:51.956 --> 02:17:53.117]  Our currency is being destroyed.
[02:17:53.478 --> 02:17:56.981]  And the American people have been listed as terrorists by the rogue federal government.
[02:17:57.808 --> 02:18:01.209]  InfoWars is going to continue to fight on, and there is a big awakening happening.
[02:18:01.229 --> 02:18:02.630]  We have a good chance of beating these people.
[02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:06.051]  But we're not going to be able to stay on air unless you support us, and you've been doing it.
[02:18:06.351 --> 02:18:07.932]  So spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:18:08.292 --> 02:18:11.873]  Pray for the broadcast, but also buy great products at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:18:12.174 --> 02:18:15.795]  If you're shopping with the big corporations or the establishment, you're aiding the enemy.

[02:18:42.613 --> 02:18:43.873]  Kate Dally Show.
[02:18:43.953 --> 02:18:45.073]  Dailyshow.com.
[02:18:45.113 --> 02:18:46.454]  D-A-L-L-E-Y.
[02:18:46.474 --> 02:18:49.314]  Kate Dally coming up here in just a minute.
[02:18:49.374 --> 02:18:51.054]  Look, I covered a lot of the news today.
[02:18:51.774 --> 02:18:52.835]  I didn't get to some of it.
[02:18:53.815 --> 02:18:57.455]  And quite frankly, this news is so big, I'm going to shoot a special report this afternoon.
[02:18:57.976 --> 02:19:00.016]  Maybe even co-host with Owen Schroer.
[02:19:00.816 --> 02:19:03.216]  He's on in about 54 minutes from now.
[02:19:04.037 --> 02:19:05.257]  Here with his weekday show, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:19:07.035 --> 02:19:07.875]  So much going on.
[02:19:08.296 --> 02:19:10.476]  I keep forgetting to put this out there.
[02:19:11.196 --> 02:19:24.841]  Next week, we're going to have a bunch of people in studio, and I'm not going to say their names yet, even though they're happy for me to say their names, but some of the biggest podcasters, biggest talk show hosts in the country.
[02:19:25.721 --> 02:19:28.142]  Not one, not two, but three of them.
[02:19:29.005 --> 02:19:31.247]  Are going to be in studio with us next week.
[02:19:31.827 --> 02:19:37.031]  So next week is going to be a big, big week here at the InfoWar.
[02:19:38.032 --> 02:19:40.995]  Because, well, let's just say a lot is happening.
[02:19:41.035 --> 02:19:43.436]  Here's an Austin American Statesman article I didn't really ever get to.
[02:19:43.456 --> 02:19:46.119]  I don't really care when I'm just in the news just to be in the news.
[02:19:46.579 --> 02:19:49.221]  But it says, is Austin a global free speech capital?
[02:19:49.761 --> 02:19:50.602]  Well, yes, it is.
[02:19:50.662 --> 02:19:58.306]   But the left's trying To stop that and so we'll be talking about that coming up next week.
[02:19:58.366 --> 02:20:06.631]  Tomorrow I'll be covering Klaus Schwab and the announcement of world government and the world social credit score and the world universal basic income.
[02:20:08.832 --> 02:20:10.073]  This is a big deal.
[02:20:10.213 --> 02:20:12.615]  We'll be breaking it down tomorrow separately.
[02:20:13.535 --> 02:20:32.754]   I really appreciate you all supporting the broadcast but everything I sell is stuff that I personally use and I think you need to have and we've got the best Satellite phone company out there a six hundred and forty something dollar phone for free when you sign up for a year of service Unlimited calls to you for regular landline cell phones.

[02:21:10.674 --> 02:21:16.958]  I really suggest, if you want to understand the whole Illuminati operation going on, you get my film The Order of Death and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:21:17.018 --> 02:21:18.499]  Both films are on the same DVD.
[02:21:19.339 --> 02:21:21.000]  Order of death, double feature.
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:23.440]  Okay, that's it for me.
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:25.301]  Kate Dally takes over right now.
[02:21:25.661 --> 02:21:26.501]  Kate, let them have it.
[02:21:28.081 --> 02:21:28.802]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:21:28.882 --> 02:21:29.662]  Great show, by the way.
[02:21:29.682 --> 02:21:30.302]  Thank you.
[02:21:31.862 --> 02:21:33.463]  Happy Veterans Day to all of you.
[02:21:33.883 --> 02:21:39.905]  And, you know, I have a lot of family that are veterans and really appreciate all that you've done.
[02:21:40.105 --> 02:21:45.266]  And I know this is breaking your heart because you know those crap politicians on both sides of the aisle.
[02:21:46.337 --> 02:21:59.186]  Those guys that put their hand over their heart and recite the pledge and tell you America's broken and they're here to fix it and then they stab you in the back, you know, and repeatedly turn us into a Marizuela.
[02:21:59.866 --> 02:22:02.728]  Well, you have to add doctors to those lists now.
[02:22:03.128 --> 02:22:09.352]  There are some good doctors, many horrid ones, and I am telling you, we're going to be talking today with Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:22:09.392 --> 02:22:12.214]  He's going to be talking about monoclonal antibodies.
[02:22:12.474 --> 02:22:14.876]  They are really shoving this down people's throats.
[02:22:15.196 --> 02:22:21.487]   They're bringing the military in to teach them how to administer this to all of you. They're
[02:22:21.487 --> 02:22:24.546]   gonna set up special bays everywhere like they're doing right now even
[02:22:24.546 --> 02:22:26.277]  in my own city.
[02:22:26.277 --> 02:22:30.996]   It's pretty horrific because they're not telling you what the truth about monoclonal
[02:22:30.996 --> 02:22:37.396]   antibodies are. They're trying to get you to take this just like what?
[02:22:35.467 --> 02:22:37.289]  You're going to trust pharma now?
[02:22:37.929 --> 02:22:40.010]  Anyway, we're going to talk about remdesivir.
[02:22:40.090 --> 02:22:42.632]  We're going to talk about the truth about monoclonal antibodies.
[02:22:42.672 --> 02:22:45.354]  I'm getting a lot of questions about these, even on my own show.
[02:22:45.734 --> 02:22:49.697]  People are emailing me like crazy and saying, what is the deal with these things?
[02:22:49.917 --> 02:22:50.637]  Is it safe?
[02:22:50.697 --> 02:22:51.578]  It sounds safe.
[02:22:52.138 --> 02:22:53.219]  No, it's anything but.
[02:22:53.699 --> 02:22:56.541]  And wait till you hear the death rate, the death rate percentage on those.
[02:22:56.961 --> 02:23:00.904]  And then also, what is the death rate of Medicare patients?
[02:23:02.475 --> 02:23:05.097]  On remdesivir that are given this drug, and why?
[02:23:05.117 --> 02:23:07.820]  You know, I played a tape yesterday on my own show.
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:16.747]  Bill Gates was talking about, this was several years back, and he was talking about how he was just grieving over the biggest problem that he saw.
[02:23:17.968 --> 02:23:29.078]  And his biggest problem in all the emails he said he was getting, because everyone's so concerned about overpopulation, was that he thought, what could I do about overpopulation?
[02:23:29.178 --> 02:23:30.019]  I must do something.
[02:23:30.865 --> 02:23:47.621]  And so in this clip, he said, you know, we've designed these new medicines, Melinda and I, we wanted to get together and design new medicines so that we could give you these medicines and get this so that healthy people would not want, would not choose to have kids anymore, right?
[02:23:47.902 --> 02:23:51.385]  They'll choose to have less kids because they'll be healthy.
[02:23:52.606 --> 02:23:53.827]  Bill Gates, that's not a thing.
[02:23:53.847 --> 02:23:55.289]  That's not even a fact.
[02:23:55.911 --> 02:23:58.312]  That's just a statement you pulled out of your rear end.
[02:23:58.752 --> 02:23:59.613]  That isn't true.
[02:23:59.633 --> 02:24:08.377]  In fact, when he was saying this, it was, we're going to reduce the population with our brand new wonderful medicines.
[02:24:08.537 --> 02:24:09.798]  I know you've heard these clips.
[02:24:10.237 --> 02:24:14.778]   I know Alex has probably played that clip, but I was hoping to hear it again
[02:24:14.778 --> 02:24:18.596]   to kind of understand what's behind this movement a little bit more,
[02:24:18.596 --> 02:24:22.797]   because we're not getting that everything they shove in our faces now
[02:24:22.797 --> 02:24:28.337]   as some sort of remedy cure that's experimental that just flew into the marketplace
[02:24:28.337 --> 02:24:31.317]  is suddenly somehow going to save us.
[02:24:31.317 --> 02:24:35.518]   And I really do hope that we're not buying in to any of this
[02:24:35.518 --> 02:24:38.358]   because here's the bottom line, and then I'll bring on Dr. Ardis,
[02:24:38.358 --> 02:24:42.177]   and he'll be telling you the facts about what is going on in this country
[02:24:42.177 --> 02:24:47.157]   with monoclonal antibodies and deaths and everything else, because we all need to hear the truth.
[02:24:47.201 --> 02:24:50.502]  But here's the bottom line takeaway that's going on right now.
[02:24:50.583 --> 02:24:53.684]  Let's just recap, shall we, in a really quick way.
[02:24:54.565 --> 02:24:57.266]  They stole all the money from Social Security years ago.
[02:24:58.146 --> 02:25:00.227]  They didn't want to expose it, right?
[02:25:00.747 --> 02:25:05.850]  So then they, part of the reason that they concocted the lie of 2020 was to hide that fact.
[02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:07.351]  It was in the works for years.
[02:25:07.871 --> 02:25:09.352]  It's a label diagnosis.
[02:25:10.233 --> 02:25:19.618]  And they call it a mystery for a reason, so that they could assign it drugs that have never been used before, like deadly remdesivir and lab-created monoclonal antibodies straight from the Rockefellers.
[02:25:20.158 --> 02:25:21.639]  The NIH knew they were deadly.
[02:25:22.139 --> 02:25:23.220]  They knew they were experimental.
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:26.822]  But it was an emergency, so no one asked why they chose these.
[02:25:27.566 --> 02:25:32.431]  They had already invented the shot way before 2020, so it was ready to go.
[02:25:32.891 --> 02:25:34.793]  They had the cure before even naming it.
[02:25:35.033 --> 02:25:35.914]  How is that even possible?
[02:25:37.015 --> 02:25:40.759]  They were hoping you wouldn't notice, and it, too, was new and experimental.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:49.928]  This entire made-up circus was concocted to treat you for a respiratory cold, flu, or pneumonia that is, in fact, extremely easy to treat.
[02:25:50.148 --> 02:25:52.010]  Always has been, but fear works.
[02:25:53.263 --> 02:25:58.387]  They divert your attention to fear so that you don't ask why they came up with this insane treatment or shot.
[02:25:59.027 --> 02:26:01.589]  You're supposed to think that all the death is happening because of COVID.
[02:26:01.789 --> 02:26:02.129]  It's not.
[02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:07.653]  The press has to do backflips in order to ignore the death and reactions in the millions.
[02:26:08.474 --> 02:26:12.076]  If you get the shot, you're not counted in the group for 15 days after.
[02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:13.777]  When has that ever happened in history?
[02:26:14.158 --> 02:26:16.800]  So that they don't have to explain your adverse reaction, that's why.
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:18.120]  Or death.
[02:26:18.821 --> 02:26:20.102]  Bottom line, they steal your money.
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:23.801]  They don't want you to storm the gates, so they just instilled fear.
[02:26:24.421 --> 02:26:32.844]  And they convinced you that you were in a plague of epic proportions, even though you knew it hasn't been going on, because you're not witnessing it.
[02:26:34.064 --> 02:26:37.445]  So that you would accept all the collateral damage of the deaths.
[02:26:38.245 --> 02:26:40.586]  No one's actually dying from a cold or pneumonia.
[02:26:40.986 --> 02:26:42.747]  It's their treatment causing the deaths.
[02:26:43.467 --> 02:26:44.367]  It's their treatment.
[02:26:45.387 --> 02:26:46.968]  It's the shot that's causing the deaths.
[02:26:47.879 --> 02:26:50.601]  It's like cutting your arm off to solve an infection in your finger.
[02:26:51.581 --> 02:26:54.963]  Respiratory for a hundred years is only treated two different ways.
[02:26:55.243 --> 02:26:57.445]  Bacterial or viral.
[02:26:58.025 --> 02:26:58.966]  Not rocket science.
[02:26:59.546 --> 02:27:00.226]  Easily treatable.
[02:27:00.807 --> 02:27:05.309]  But they're convincing you it's new and deadly and scary so they'll take their insane shot and insane treatment.
[02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:11.993]  And getting rid of you is easier if you are voluntarily subjecting yourself for this.
[02:27:12.713 --> 02:27:14.134]  Then they'll never have to do it by force.
[02:27:15.035 --> 02:27:16.216]  It's all about money and control.
[02:27:16.256 --> 02:27:16.856]  We all know this.
[02:27:17.817 --> 02:27:23.621]  And there's way more to it, because we know that a lot of our future is held in the factor that they want it in every arm.
[02:27:23.661 --> 02:27:24.442]  They're desperate.
[02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:27.444]  They're so beyond desperate that it's becoming pathetic.
[02:27:28.584 --> 02:27:36.890]  Our tax dollars are being used to bribe everyone into shoring up this law, or this lie, and hospitals are being paid to buy into these laws.
[02:27:37.529 --> 02:27:38.029]  I mean life.
[02:27:39.210 --> 02:27:39.830]  I can get it right.
[02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:47.074]  So I'm going to bring on Dr. Artis and let me just tell you, there's so much to know about monoclonal antibodies.
[02:27:47.194 --> 02:27:48.435]  Stay away from, beware.
[02:27:49.015 --> 02:27:50.676]  And this is the show to tell you about it.
[02:27:50.696 --> 02:27:52.337]  I'm really happy to be here.
[02:27:52.697 --> 02:27:55.838]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, katedallyradio.com.
[02:27:55.878 --> 02:27:59.700]  I'm live after this for three hours and I'll be right back.
[02:28:00.081 --> 02:28:00.761]  I'll be right back.
[02:28:00.801 --> 02:28:01.721]  We'll be talking about this.
[02:28:01.822 --> 02:28:02.502]  You'll want to hear this.
[02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:06.641]  Hi there, back with you, Kate Dally, your guest host from The Kate Dally Show.
[02:28:06.781 --> 02:28:20.386]  So happy to be here and also I just wanted to mention I have Dr. Brian Artis which I'm very happy about because man what a champion in bringing things to light and also letting people know about the treatment protocol.
[02:28:20.406 --> 02:28:36.773]   He was the first doctor to do this and then also with remdesivir of course and then also we're going to be talking about monoclonal antibodies because this is the latest attempt To try to get everybody into this particular treatment as a cure-all, as a remedy.
[02:28:37.073 --> 02:28:39.415]  And we're going to be talking to Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:28:40.315 --> 02:28:41.196]  Dr. Artis, are you there?
[02:28:43.037 --> 02:28:43.417]  I'm here.
[02:28:43.457 --> 02:28:43.817]  How are you?
[02:28:43.837 --> 02:28:44.077]  Perfect.
[02:28:45.178 --> 02:28:45.638]  I'm good.
[02:28:45.658 --> 02:28:46.319]  How are you doing?
[02:28:47.659 --> 02:28:48.120]  Excellent.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:49.821]  Doing very good.
[02:28:49.841 --> 02:28:51.942]  I'm at the Reawakened Tour in San Antonio.
[02:28:53.659 --> 02:28:54.280]  Ah, perfect.
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:55.140]  I'm so glad.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:59.524]  We need to bring a lot of awareness and we need to wake a lot of people up out there and I'm glad you're doing it.
[02:28:59.584 --> 02:29:00.925]  You're the right person to do this.
[02:29:01.345 --> 02:29:03.247]  Tell us about monoclonal antibodies.
[02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:15.036]  Yeah, so I've had concerns about monoclonal antibodies from the very beginning, even when they surfaced to start be suggested that they could be a cure for early treatment source for COVID-19.
[02:29:16.095 --> 02:29:29.486]  And the reason being is most people know me because I blew the whistle on remdesivir being chosen as the experimental antiviral to be used on all 100% of Americans that were hospitalized for COVID-19.
[02:29:30.207 --> 02:29:32.149]  And that's an extremely dangerous drug.
[02:29:32.609 --> 02:29:45.411]   Well, the whole reason why monoclonal antibodies is even being discussed is because in the same trial that Anthony Fauci said, Monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir were proven to be safe and effective against Ebola virus.
[02:29:45.972 --> 02:29:47.252]  It was in an Ebola trial.
[02:29:47.732 --> 02:29:52.575]  And it was remdesivir compared to three different monoclonal antibodies.
[02:29:53.235 --> 02:29:59.338]  It was remdesivir, ZMAP, which was put in by our United States Department of Health and Human Services.
[02:29:59.958 --> 02:30:04.180]  It was also MAB114 that was put in by DARPA.
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:08.782]  And then the fourth monoclonal antibody is the one you're hearing the most about in the media.
[02:30:09.281 --> 02:30:10.601]  And it's called Regeneron.
[02:30:11.081 --> 02:30:13.462]  These are not brand new ideas or treatments.
[02:30:13.662 --> 02:30:16.702]  They are antibodies that were also used against Ebola.
[02:30:17.142 --> 02:30:25.124]  And what they found, this is the disgusting part for me, and the very hard rationale for me to why we would use them against coronavirus.
[02:30:25.904 --> 02:30:33.125]  Kate, less than 1% of the entire world who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 ends up dying from COVID.
[02:30:33.965 --> 02:30:35.646]  Now, that's less than 1% mortality.
[02:30:37.296 --> 02:30:45.800]  In the Ebola virus trial, that is the supportive study for why we're using Remdesivir and why these monoclonal antibodies are being suggested.
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:47.881]  My problem was this.
[02:30:48.801 --> 02:30:53.823]  Remdesivir had a mortality rate of 54.1%, or 53.1%.
[02:30:55.164 --> 02:31:05.528]  Each of the monoclonal antibodies in order had mortality rates in the Ebola trial of 49.7%, that was ZMAP, which was a triple monoclonal antibody.
[02:31:06.249 --> 02:31:13.712]  The second was actually called MAV114 and it had a death rate of 35% of all Ebola virus patients treated.
[02:31:14.553 --> 02:31:23.977]  The Regeneron triple monoclonal antibody put in by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, it had a death rate in the actual Ebola trial of 33%.
[02:31:26.059 --> 02:31:37.802]  I don't understand why we are actually even looking at a study of any drugs that have a mortality rate higher than the less than 1% that the virus is actually causing.
[02:31:38.542 --> 02:31:39.922]  To me, it makes zero sense.
[02:31:40.543 --> 02:31:42.783]  I do have concerns with the monoclonal antibodies.
[02:31:43.243 --> 02:31:47.184]  They do have mortality rates better than remdesivir.
[02:31:47.884 --> 02:31:51.625]  So if you had to just pick between those two evils, go with monoclonal antibodies.
[02:31:52.505 --> 02:31:53.766]  I don't know if you know this, Kate.
[02:31:53.926 --> 02:31:54.746]  Your audience should know.
[02:31:55.336 --> 02:32:10.426]  There's actually five studies in which antibodies that are directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or any of its variants, which is what monoclonal antibodies are, they are linked to autoimmune diseases in the body.
[02:32:10.726 --> 02:32:16.891]  And you are putting tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of these antibodies into a body with an injection.
[02:32:17.351 --> 02:32:21.854]  And those antibodies are known to be seeking spike proteins in the body.
[02:32:22.509 --> 02:32:42.162]  And when they find anything that looks like spike proteins, which is the epithelial cells of the lungs, it's the actual gut lining, we know these antibodies target the actual genes that lead to celiac disease, Hashimoto's disease, which is autoimmune hypothyroiditis.
[02:32:42.862 --> 02:33:15.013]   We already know, the research studies prove, that antibodies against spike proteins, which is what monoclonal antibodies do, On their own, they target exactly the same tissues that the Salk Institute figured out spike proteins damage, which out of 55 tissues in the human body, spike proteins and the antibodies that attack spike proteins damage and cause diseases of 28 different tissues in the body, including the brain, and we know the antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies,
[02:33:15.777 --> 02:33:21.882]  And directly cause demyelination of nerve tissue, which is called multiple sclerosis.
[02:33:22.943 --> 02:33:27.206]  So there is neurological inflammation and damage from the spike proteins and antibodies.
[02:33:27.746 --> 02:33:30.508]  There's kidney inflammation and disease caused by them.
[02:33:31.229 --> 02:33:37.114]  Gut lining issues like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiacs, IBS.
[02:33:37.674 --> 02:33:50.973]   All of these are known side effects in five to six different research studies we know about monoclonal antibodies that target spike proteins On their own, causing disease.
[02:33:51.153 --> 02:33:56.037]  It's almost unbelievable because they keep saying the words, safe and effective, safe and effective.
[02:33:56.297 --> 02:34:06.466]  And you know the FDA document that describes monoclonal antibodies, they actually say, the limitations are you should not give this to anyone hospitalized with COVID.
[02:34:07.296 --> 02:34:10.797]  And they're giving it to people that are hospitalized with COVID.
[02:34:11.097 --> 02:34:25.499]  So you could be healthy and you could walk out, right, of a dose of monoclonal antibodies, but what it's doing to your system and to your immune system long term is one of the problems that they're not talking about, correct?
[02:34:26.819 --> 02:34:33.541]  Yeah, Kate, the actual cells they get monoclonal antibodies from, they're actually called hybrid omas.
[02:34:34.141 --> 02:34:35.861]  Do you know where they get those cells from?
[02:34:37.059 --> 02:34:38.920]  B-cells from cancer cells.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:52.364]  These are actually derived from cancer lines from B-cells outside of spleens and we know that they can actually create long-term the development for the stages of every known cancer in the human body.
[02:34:52.824 --> 02:34:59.786]  You're not going to see the detrimental issues like myocarditis from the COVID-19 shots in seven days like we're seeing with teenagers.
[02:35:00.216 --> 02:35:05.580]  These monoclonal antibodies can initiate disease processes that will continue to perpetuate.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:12.585]  Disease processes where we start to become aware of them with symptoms, they can be three years down the road, five years down the road.
[02:35:13.125 --> 02:35:19.950]  So it's great to know, I would say it's great, that people receiving monoclonal antibodies, they're going home after five to seven days.
[02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:21.831]  It's better than them being dead.
[02:35:22.538 --> 02:35:33.080]  30% of all people being treated with remdesivir older the age of 65 in hospitals, it's 26.9% of all of them die in American hospitals from remdesivir poisoning.
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:36.561]  Is it better that they get to live a little bit longer with monoclonal antibodies?
[02:35:37.101 --> 02:35:37.421]  Yes.
[02:35:38.001 --> 02:35:40.982]  Is it better that they have a better survival rate than remdesivir?
[02:35:41.482 --> 02:35:42.142]  Absolutely.
[02:35:42.802 --> 02:35:43.903]  What is my concern?
[02:35:43.943 --> 02:35:44.823]  My concern is this.
[02:35:45.363 --> 02:35:49.584]  There is only one drug in the entire world for its entire lifetime of use.
[02:35:50.478 --> 02:36:00.823]  has gone around the world for four decades and has a lower mortality rate than the actual virus in any of its COVID-19 variants.
[02:36:01.423 --> 02:36:04.045]  And that one drug, Kate, is Ivermectin.
[02:36:04.765 --> 02:36:07.386]  Ivermectin has a less than 1% mortality rate.
[02:36:07.406 --> 02:36:10.308]  It's better than the death rate from SARS-CoV-2.
[02:36:10.868 --> 02:36:27.104]   Why are we considering any other drugs when Ivermectin has 63 different studies from 18 different countries Proving that in 24 to 48 hours, it stops the COVID-19 disease process and stops its transmission.
[02:36:27.404 --> 02:36:29.105]  Because it's a huge mystery.
[02:36:29.345 --> 02:36:33.847]  It's a huge mystery, killer, plague, disease, it's airborne, it's gonna get you.
[02:36:34.187 --> 02:36:36.348]  And I'm gonna come right back with Dr. Brian Ardis.
[02:36:36.368 --> 02:36:37.248]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:36:37.508 --> 02:36:38.849]  You're gonna want to hear the rest of this.
[02:36:38.869 --> 02:36:39.709]  We have a lot to say.
[02:36:40.743 --> 02:36:45.690]  Back here with you, Kate Daly, your guest host, and we're talking about monoclonal antibodies.
[02:36:45.730 --> 02:36:47.493]  We're talking with Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:36:47.994 --> 02:36:56.486]  And let me just tell you, has anyone noticed that every single thing they're doing since the year 2020 is experimental, brand new, but they swear and swear and swear?
[02:36:56.966 --> 02:36:58.006]  It's safe and effective.
[02:36:58.306 --> 02:37:11.029]  Everything that they are choosing was something that they worked on a long time ago, was never out in the public, was never in trials, but now they're introducing it as the, we know it's the remedy and cure for all.
[02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:15.609]  My guest, Dr. Brian Artis from The Dr. Artis Show dot com.
[02:37:15.729 --> 02:37:17.590]  The Dr. Artis Show dot com.
[02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:18.910]  So happy to have you.
[02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:23.651]  It is truly amazing that they're getting away with this and all because of an emergency, correct?
[02:37:24.131 --> 02:37:26.752]  This is why we're getting shoved all of these different items at us.
[02:37:28.433 --> 02:37:28.933]  You're right.
[02:37:29.073 --> 02:37:34.996]  And if anybody wants to try to get some clarity around this, I would recommend everybody get one web address.
[02:37:35.076 --> 02:37:39.699]  It's called c19early.com.
[02:37:39.719 --> 02:37:40.839]  C19early.com.
[02:37:41.099 --> 02:37:42.280]  It gets updated daily.
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:46.922]  I would recommend everybody go to the third chart on that page every day that gets updated.
[02:37:48.103 --> 02:37:57.084]   It looks at research studies from hospitalized COVID-19 patients from around the world And it compares, on that third chart, all mortality results.
[02:37:57.564 --> 02:38:16.739]  And it shows you which experimental medications, which research items, nutrients, like iodine, vitamin C, vitamin D. And they compare those medications, supplements, you name it, against all of each other to look for what has the greatest success rate at getting people out of hospitals.
[02:38:17.379 --> 02:38:20.121]  And I want to focus on the chart which you've got on the screen right now.
[02:38:20.622 --> 02:38:27.983]   Everyone should notice that at the bottom of this third chart, At the near the bottom, like the fifth or sixth from the bottom, is Remdesivir.
[02:38:28.443 --> 02:38:37.707]  And Remdesivir, which is the only drug being used in the United States of America in every hospital for COVID-19, and in Brazil, is the only drug being used in all Brazil.
[02:38:37.807 --> 02:38:44.489]  And these two countries have the highest death rates, Kate, of all deaths of COVID around the world.
[02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:47.190]  We're the only two countries using Remdesivir.
[02:38:47.431 --> 02:38:52.012]  And what's the percentage of success of Remdesivir getting people out of hospitals with COVID-19?
[02:38:52.253 --> 02:38:53.273]  Read the percentage there, Kate.
[02:38:55.015 --> 02:38:56.496]  Oh my gosh.
[02:38:57.216 --> 02:38:57.716]  It's 19%.
[02:38:58.256 --> 02:38:57.716]  19%.
[02:38:58.336 --> 02:38:59.276]  Now look at the cost.
[02:38:59.316 --> 02:38:59.877]  Go to the right.
[02:38:59.917 --> 02:39:05.238]  What does it cost on average for a five-day treatment of remdesivir?
[02:39:06.299 --> 02:39:05.238]  $3,120.
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:10.460]  Now I want you to scroll up to the top.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.241]  It only has a 19% success rate.
[02:39:12.261 --> 02:39:13.521]  Let's go to the top of that graph.
[02:39:13.581 --> 02:39:14.621]  Everyone needs to watch this.
[02:39:15.302 --> 02:39:18.643]  I want you to get to povidone iodine at the top.
[02:39:18.963 --> 02:39:20.363]  It's like the fifth one down.
[02:39:20.803 --> 02:39:21.604]  It has an 88% success rate.
[02:39:23.399 --> 02:39:32.565]  And what they found in this research study was the viral loads for SARS-CoV-2 is mostly found in the respiratory tract, your nasal septum, and in your throat.
[02:39:33.166 --> 02:39:49.216]  And when you used povidone iodine and used a nasal spray of it twice a day into the nose and then gargled it twice, two times, hospitalized patients for COVID-19 went home totally clear of COVID 88% of the time.
[02:39:49.556 --> 02:39:53.219]  And look at the look at the cost for a treatment of iodine.
[02:39:54.807 --> 02:39:55.968]  A dollar, a whole buck.
[02:39:56.308 --> 02:39:56.848]  Wow.
[02:39:58.109 --> 02:39:59.849]  It's a whole dollar.
[02:40:02.351 --> 02:40:03.031]  All right.
[02:40:03.051 --> 02:40:03.811]  So hey, Dave.
[02:40:05.412 --> 02:40:09.894]  You hear all the time on Alex Jones Show and InfoWars, you hear about the benefits and pluses of iodine.
[02:40:10.555 --> 02:40:14.697]  I have used povidone iodine for like 20 years in practice.
[02:40:15.197 --> 02:40:17.658]  I use it as a sore throat gargle for strep throats.
[02:40:17.738 --> 02:40:19.379]  It's an amazing way to mix that.
[02:40:19.759 --> 02:40:20.579]  I'll give you what I did.
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:21.880]  Everyone should probably do it.
[02:40:22.329 --> 02:40:36.401]  But you take four drops of povidone iodine and eight ounces of water, or 12 ounces of water, one heaping tablespoon of sea salt, and then add one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide and gargle it.
[02:40:37.041 --> 02:40:40.224]  This is such an effective antiviral cleanser.
[02:40:40.504 --> 02:40:45.628]  It helps remove any sore throat symptoms in 48 hours or less, even with strep throat.
[02:40:46.129 --> 02:40:48.831]  It's also been proven to be super effective against COVID.
[02:40:49.291 --> 02:40:50.352]  I would use this as a resource.
[02:40:50.392 --> 02:40:57.897]   Now, I need you to know, Kate, On that chart, povidone-iodine was actually number one up until about two weeks ago.
[02:40:58.457 --> 02:41:05.599]  And now you're seeing things on top of that list, all of which are experimental drugs being produced by Pfizer and Merck.
[02:41:06.079 --> 02:41:08.320]  And these are from their studies, the ones above there.
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:11.281]  And I need to talk about the one that's at number two.
[02:41:11.661 --> 02:41:15.022]  You'll see a 95% success rate with anti-androgens.
[02:41:15.242 --> 02:41:15.702]  Do you see that?
[02:41:16.428 --> 02:41:18.029]  Mm-hmm.
[02:41:18.049 --> 02:41:18.369]  Sure.
[02:41:18.629 --> 02:41:21.131]  I don't know if your audience knows this, but look at the cost.
[02:41:21.191 --> 02:41:23.932]  It costs $5 for an anti-androgen medication.
[02:41:25.173 --> 02:41:25.473]  Right.
[02:41:25.493 --> 02:41:31.356]  Now, an androgen is actually hormones known as estrogen and testosterone most commonly.
[02:41:31.876 --> 02:41:42.002]  But when it comes to the disease process of COVID-19 and all cancers, the most problematic hormone that's an androgen hormone is estrogen.
[02:41:42.799 --> 02:41:45.942]  And they're using anti-androgen hormones that cost five bucks.
[02:41:46.222 --> 02:41:49.725]  It actually, in just a couple days, gets people to go home from hospitals with COVID-19.
[02:41:50.166 --> 02:41:51.727]  Do you know what's amazing, Kate?
[02:41:52.908 --> 02:42:04.118]  They have a drug that they inject called anti-androgens, but do you know what mineral supplement is also a very effective anti-androgen hormone supplement?
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:06.120]  Tell me.
[02:42:07.481 --> 02:42:08.162]  It's zinc.
[02:42:09.975 --> 02:42:18.040]  In fact, zinc deficiency is the number one cause for estrogen dominance in all human beings.
[02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:19.341]  Zinc deficiency.
[02:42:19.821 --> 02:42:29.027]  Zinc is also the only mineral inside of cells that stops all viruses, including coronaviruses, from replicating.
[02:42:30.089 --> 02:42:35.351]  So zinc is not only effective against the COVID-19 virus or any of its variants, the flu virus, you name it.
[02:42:35.491 --> 02:42:36.972]  Everyone needs to be supplementing zinc.
[02:42:37.672 --> 02:42:40.213]  I suggest 50 milligrams to 100 every day.
[02:42:40.773 --> 02:42:50.197]  But its anti-androgen hormone balancing effect for estrogen and testosterone is hugely beneficial in the immune processes to beat COVID-19.
[02:42:50.217 --> 02:42:50.397]  Right.
[02:42:53.458 --> 02:42:54.379]  You know what this is like?
[02:42:54.719 --> 02:42:59.402]  This reminds me of somebody having a hangnail and they want to treat it with AZT.
[02:43:01.033 --> 02:43:03.614]  And they want to treat it with chopping off the arm.
[02:43:04.114 --> 02:43:06.175]  And they come up with all these concoctions.
[02:43:06.575 --> 02:43:08.736]  And what you're saying is, this is so simple.
[02:43:09.016 --> 02:43:09.997]  This is so easy.
[02:43:10.297 --> 02:43:12.038]  You don't even need to go to a hospital.
[02:43:12.078 --> 02:43:16.879]  You can actually treat this at home if you just have some things on hand and know what to do.
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:25.323]  And for some reason, they have instilled the fear of God into everybody that they're going to die, that they're going to die and they all have COVID.
[02:43:25.743 --> 02:43:27.724]  It's truly amazing what fear can do.
[02:43:29.753 --> 02:43:30.474]  It is very true.
[02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:38.300]  And I just want everybody to know on this show, monoclonal antibodies don't show up anywhere higher than povidone iodine on that list for beating COVID-19.
[02:43:38.361 --> 02:43:39.842]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:43:40.222 --> 02:43:45.547]  But you don't see them promoting povidone iodine clinics and treatment centers around the country.
[02:43:46.027 --> 02:43:46.688]  It's too cheap.
[02:43:46.728 --> 02:43:51.212]  You can go get povidone iodine at any CVS Walgreens in the country for less than $5.
[02:43:54.219 --> 02:43:55.560]  It's totally amazing to me.
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.700]  It's very cheap to do.
[02:43:56.721 --> 02:43:57.821]  You can do it at home.
[02:43:57.921 --> 02:43:59.403]  Just have the right things on hand.
[02:43:59.903 --> 02:44:00.904]  Anyone can do this.
[02:44:01.304 --> 02:44:05.588]  We have to spread the word because they are really pushing monoclonal antibodies.
[02:44:05.608 --> 02:44:14.174]  They're having the military in my city administer it to people as they're propping up bays as if we need this, you know, in some sort of emergency situation.
[02:44:14.515 --> 02:44:16.316]  And people are walking around just fine.
[02:44:16.556 --> 02:44:17.297]  So what are they going to do?
[02:44:17.617 --> 02:44:21.759]  They're going to inject this stuff in their system and they're going to walk away thinking, oh, see, I'm good.
[02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:22.220]  I'm good.
[02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:24.201]  When COVID hits me, I'll be all right.
[02:44:24.401 --> 02:44:29.224]  The problem is, is that it's hurting their immune system long term and they don't know it.
[02:44:30.325 --> 02:44:31.865]  Not just the immune system, Kate.
[02:44:31.945 --> 02:44:34.287]  There's two studies I was just looking at earlier today.
[02:44:34.787 --> 02:44:39.910]  The antibodies that attack spike proteins of a SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[02:44:40.531 --> 02:44:42.912]  That's what monoclonal antibodies are.
[02:44:43.683 --> 02:44:54.729]  They actually are shown and proven to damage the cells inside of the uterus during a pregnancy to lead to abortions, miscarriages, infertility, birth defects.
[02:44:55.289 --> 02:45:05.875]  There's a huge issue with this, not just with illness, an immune system, that's actually damaging diseases, including those organs that are responsible for healthy fertility.
[02:45:06.416 --> 02:45:11.799]  So any female, young female, would be super concerned to have monoclonal antibodies introduced into their body.
[02:45:13.027 --> 02:45:15.748]  It just is a huge threat long term and I would try to avoid it.
[02:45:15.848 --> 02:45:23.469]  Remember, 28 tissues in the human body are damaged just like the spike proteins for the Salk Institute.
[02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:34.732]  Monoclonal antibodies that attack spike proteins and look for those are known to cause the exact array of diseases throughout the entire human body over time as do spike proteins.
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:41.723]  Yeah, and by the way, they call this antibody so that you think you're getting some terrific product.
[02:45:42.023 --> 02:45:47.987]  It's kind of like every bill they name is named Apple Pie America We Love You Bill or Act.
[02:45:48.427 --> 02:45:51.529]  It's all sold on the exact opposite premise.
[02:45:51.849 --> 02:45:56.552]  This is so disgusting to me that they keep shoving these things at us, but the hospitals are paid big bucks.
[02:45:56.892 --> 02:46:01.636]  And when they administer these in the hospital, they're given $13,000.
[02:46:01.716 --> 02:46:05.138]  Well, that's an easy paycheck coming out of our tax dollars, right?
[02:46:05.259 --> 02:46:07.861]  In that circular motion all the way around to the hospital.
[02:46:07.921 --> 02:46:09.001]  So we'll be right back.
[02:46:09.041 --> 02:46:10.803]  I'll be right back with Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:46:10.843 --> 02:46:11.603]  Isn't he amazing?
[02:46:12.104 --> 02:46:14.606]  And of course, Alex's show is off the hook today.
[02:46:14.746 --> 02:46:15.146]  Great.
[02:46:15.586 --> 02:46:19.089]  And I hope that all of us are learning about these antibodies.
[02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:19.930]  Oh, stay away.
[02:46:20.470 --> 02:46:21.310]  I'm back here with you.
[02:46:21.350 --> 02:46:29.373]  I'm Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com, trying to bring you all these topics so that we can get a great understanding of the things we need.
[02:46:29.773 --> 02:46:39.176]  I have Dr. Brian Artis on with me and he is just a rock star frontline doctor who is absolutely trying to warn everybody what you can do.
[02:46:39.556 --> 02:46:45.898]  In fact, we were talking earlier about Medicare patients dying at kind of an alarming rate on these treatments.
[02:46:46.378 --> 02:46:52.904]  And I just wanted you to say, just talk about that for just a moment, Dr. Brian Artis, because people really need to understand this.
[02:46:52.944 --> 02:47:10.820]  By the way, his website is thedoctorartisshow.com and you can get help if you're in a hospital and you don't know what to say to the doctors, you have all kinds of questions, make sure and put your email in there and then that will unlock all those emails you'll get as far as this dire information that we all need to know.
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:12.382]  But welcome back, Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:14.500]  Thank you, Kate.
[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:15.541]  You're a rock star, too.
[02:47:15.601 --> 02:47:23.125]  Great job spreading truth and even saving your own husband from the horrible, murderous protocol in hospitals.
[02:47:23.185 --> 02:47:23.845]  I'm very proud of you.
[02:47:25.246 --> 02:47:31.409]  Now, as far as the Dr. Arnish, as far as the DrArnishShow.com, this is just a very important resource I think everybody should have.
[02:47:31.489 --> 02:47:38.333]  Right now, hospitals, as you've experienced, are really operating more like prisons than they are hospitals or care centers.
[02:47:38.922 --> 02:47:42.044]  And there are two forms on my Dr. Artis Show website.
[02:47:42.144 --> 02:47:44.785]  There is a medical directive for physicians.
[02:47:45.345 --> 02:47:47.046]  So this is an advanced directive.
[02:47:47.066 --> 02:47:55.110]  You want to take with you a form that you want to have signed and notarized before you take yourself or a loved one to a hospital.
[02:47:55.891 --> 02:48:01.214]  It actually tells them there's five things you will not do to me if you determine I'm a COVID-19 patient.
[02:48:01.794 --> 02:48:03.235]  You will not use remdesivir.
[02:48:03.275 --> 02:48:05.756]  You will not vent me under any premise.
[02:48:06.181 --> 02:48:09.403]  Or any reasoning or under any condition, I do not consent.
[02:48:09.423 --> 02:48:19.727]  I don't know if you know this, Kate, but in hospitals right now, there's some of them around the country that are having disclaimers built into their admissions forms that you don't read.
[02:48:20.448 --> 02:48:28.011]  And people who do not read them, if they sign the form, it says, by signing this form, you consent to the hospital giving you the COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:48:28.691 --> 02:48:35.741]   Now, there's also on that directive form, on our directive form, the fourth bullet point is, I don't consent.
[02:48:36.121 --> 02:48:43.247]  If you admit me into this hospital or move me to a psychiatric facility, I never consent to the COVID-19 shots.
[02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:47.290]  You have to have some of these things in place along with the medical power of attorney form.
[02:48:47.571 --> 02:48:52.415]  You find that at our site by setting up an account with a username and password and log back in.
[02:48:52.455 --> 02:48:57.479]  The resources page appears and that's where you find the forms at the bottom for anybody who needs to go to a hospital.
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:48:59.581]  The rib decimere stuff you asked about.
[02:49:00.393 --> 02:49:16.678]  I don't know if you know this, but Medicare and Medicaid services are bribing all hospitals in the country with a 20% bonus payout if that hospital or doctor's facility will treat 65-year and older Medicare patients in America with Remdesivir versus any other treatment.
[02:49:17.378 --> 02:49:21.680]  So they're being incentivized to use, like we showed you on that website, audience.
[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:27.922]  We showed you that Remdesivir only has a 19% success rate or survivability rate with COVID-19.
[02:49:29.022 --> 02:49:34.165]  But Medicare is bribing hospitals to use it and paying them 20% more.
[02:49:34.685 --> 02:49:35.986]  This should make you furious.
[02:49:36.467 --> 02:49:37.407]  It makes me furious.
[02:49:38.168 --> 02:49:46.252]  And I cannot wait to help you guys understand there are options you have to protect you and your loved ones in hospitals.
[02:49:46.292 --> 02:49:52.356]  You need that advance directive form on our site written up by attorneys and the medical power of attorney form.
[02:49:52.776 --> 02:49:58.949]   Remdesivir right now the statistics are anybody 65 years and older Including in the state of New York.
[02:49:58.989 --> 02:50:01.392]  We've done the entire state CMS's data review.
[02:50:02.112 --> 02:50:09.399]  It's 26.9% of every Medicare-age patient in New York who went through the five-day treatment with remdesivir.
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:10.320]  They died.
[02:50:11.221 --> 02:50:12.523]  That's 26.9% hate.
[02:50:12.703 --> 02:50:17.667]  COVID kills less than 1% of the entire world that's got this infection.
[02:50:17.988 --> 02:50:22.272]  Why would you choose any drug that has a higher mortality than one percentage rate?
[02:50:24.612 --> 02:50:25.093]  I don't know.
[02:50:25.113 --> 02:50:34.139]  I don't know anymore what is going through people's minds, but I want you to tell people too, anyone that's sitting at home that says, I'm just not quite sure what to get.
[02:50:34.199 --> 02:50:42.324]  What are the five most important things I should have in my house right now that would prepare me so that I don't even have to use a directive or go to the hospital?
[02:50:42.684 --> 02:50:44.245]  What would you tell people to do?
[02:50:44.345 --> 02:50:46.567]  What would you tell them to get?
[02:50:46.587 --> 02:50:47.488]  Great question, Kate.
[02:50:47.528 --> 02:50:52.531]  Alright, so for those of you who want to have medications at home, there's two main ones everybody should have.
[02:50:53.297 --> 02:50:57.441]  It's going to be Budesonide rest fuels and make sure you have a nebulizer.
[02:50:57.921 --> 02:51:01.644]  You can get Budesonide through a prescription or through compound pharmacies.
[02:51:02.144 --> 02:51:06.028]  Go to synergyhealthdpc.com.
[02:51:06.508 --> 02:51:11.472]  They can help you get these via telemedicine and they actually direct ship from compound pharmacies.
[02:51:11.853 --> 02:51:16.596]  Budesonide and Ivermectin, they can both help you with those medications to have those at home.
[02:51:16.917 --> 02:51:19.559]  I do not recommend using it until you have any symptoms of any kind.
[02:51:19.963 --> 02:51:20.843]  Those are the medication.
[02:51:21.083 --> 02:51:25.005]  Outside of the medications, everyone should be taking zinc, like we mentioned earlier.
[02:51:25.025 --> 02:51:31.127]  50 milligrams to 100 milligrams every day, I recommend, and I do take every day, and so does my wife.
[02:51:31.887 --> 02:51:37.829]  Second would be vitamin C at 5,000 milligrams every day for the rest of your life.
[02:51:38.629 --> 02:51:42.030]  Selenium at 200 micrograms.
[02:51:42.470 --> 02:51:44.291]  This is a very cheap supplement, go get it.
[02:51:44.691 --> 02:51:55.431]   Selenium tells your bone marrow to make more white blood cells That's your natural immunity that helps to protect you against all viruses including those that man-made like SARS-CoV-2.
[02:51:56.272 --> 02:52:07.781]  Selenium helps also make your liver produce glutathione that protects every cell on the outside of inside your body from damages from spike proteins, viruses, poisons, even ionized radiation.
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:12.283]  I recommend those, and I also recommend vitamin D, 5,000 IUs.
[02:52:12.923 --> 02:52:21.831]  We're moving into the wintertime, and sunlight will be less and less for the majority of those living above, you know, the midline of the United States.
[02:52:22.151 --> 02:52:25.754]  We should all be taking vitamin D. So, those are the things I would recommend you have on hand, all of you.
[02:52:27.259 --> 02:52:34.307]  But you know, it's interesting that we're always sold on the fact that, oh no, take minimal, oh no, that's too much, that's scary, that might hurt you.
[02:52:34.647 --> 02:52:35.208]  But you know what?
[02:52:35.368 --> 02:52:37.490]  High doses of these things do not hurt.
[02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:47.181]  In fact, in the 1940s, the amount they were giving of vitamin C for patients with pneumonia to get it gone and quick was $15,000 to $20,000.
[02:52:48.141 --> 02:52:49.581]  20,000 a day.
[02:52:49.581 --> 02:52:53.621]   So when you're saying take even 5,000, you know when you're healthy, but you wanna maintain,
[02:52:53.621 --> 02:52:57.421]   take 10,000, maybe when you're sick, this is what we did for my husband in the hospital.
[02:52:57.421 --> 02:53:00.101]  So that's not that much, but we've been trained.
[02:53:00.101 --> 02:53:02.182]  The doctors tell you, oh no, you don't need those.
[02:53:02.182 --> 02:53:03.541]  We're all depleted, right?
[02:53:03.541 --> 02:53:09.262]   Oh yes, and you should know, and your audience should know, in January of 2020,
[02:53:09.262 --> 02:53:14.621]   do you remember the Wuhan lab had those few people that got sick in China with COVID-19 pneumonia?
[02:53:14.621 --> 02:53:18.301]   In January of 2020, the Chinese government already figured out
[02:53:18.301 --> 02:53:22.662]   that in hospitals, if they just simply injected their Chinese citizens
[02:53:22.662 --> 02:53:31.900]   that were sick with 25 grams of vitamin C a day, they all, 100% of them, beat the pneumonia,
[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:34.820]  and were all home by day five, 100% of them.
[02:53:34.254 --> 02:53:34.694]  100% of all of them.
[02:53:35.195 --> 02:53:36.496]  That's 25 grams.
[02:53:36.756 --> 02:53:38.858]  That's 25,000 milligrams.
[02:53:39.337 --> 02:53:44.897]   Now, if that's safe to inject directly into your veins, Kate, you and I are correct.
[02:53:44.897 --> 02:53:52.337]   5,000 to 10,000 milligrams of vitamin C every day orally, totally safe, totally warranted.
[02:53:52.337 --> 02:53:58.896]   And I would not trust the FDA's recommendations on nutrition ever, if you guys haven't doubted them yet.
[02:53:58.896 --> 02:54:04.458]   This FDA group, the Food and Drug Administration, that tells all of us Americans
[02:54:04.458 --> 02:54:06.537]  how much vitamin C we should eat a day.
[02:54:06.593 --> 02:54:08.254]  How much zinc every day we should take?
[02:54:08.654 --> 02:54:10.416]  How many selenium and magnesium?
[02:54:10.816 --> 02:54:31.193]  This same organization who tells you how much minerals and vitamins you should eat, or it's dangerous if you take more than that, is the same organization, Kate, who just said, we don't care that the CDC shows a 5 and a 20 times more incidence of heart disease from the Pfizer shot in teenagers, teenage girls and boys.
[02:54:31.593 --> 02:54:32.454]  We don't care about that.
[02:54:32.858 --> 02:54:40.603]  We're going to go ahead and inject all 5 to 11 year old children in this country, 28 million of them, with these experimental deadly shots.
[02:54:41.243 --> 02:54:42.884]  I wouldn't trust anything the FDA tells you.
[02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:45.750]  Yeah, I wouldn't either, actually.
[02:54:45.770 --> 02:54:47.250]  I'm really glad you told the audience that.
[02:54:47.270 --> 02:54:55.954]  I'm really glad to hear that from you, because people need to hear it again and again to combat the mainstream media horrors that dispel bad information every day.
[02:54:56.294 --> 02:55:03.377]  And also, since the 1970s, you know, the food pyramid even gave us the monstrosity that we are today in obesity.
[02:55:03.677 --> 02:55:04.877]  We're a fat nation!
[02:55:04.937 --> 02:55:08.779]  We were not that fat nation in 1970, but we started listening to them.
[02:55:09.119 --> 02:55:11.241]  So that's why I don't give them much credence.
[02:55:11.341 --> 02:55:12.482]  I don't know why people do.
[02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:16.566]  It's kind of like waiting for truth to come out of the mainstream media before you believe it.
[02:55:16.886 --> 02:55:18.467]  They're not going to tell the truth.
[02:55:18.868 --> 02:55:20.889]  And these people are not going to tell the truth.
[02:55:20.969 --> 02:55:23.872]  It's a money incentive program, pay for play.
[02:55:24.252 --> 02:55:28.396]  And so in this last minute and a half, what do you want people to know?
[02:55:28.436 --> 02:55:35.022]  They're getting told every day in the news that monoclonal antibodies that just came out are the most amazing thing they'll ever take.
[02:55:35.866 --> 02:55:39.067]  Oh, please, people, do not believe this for a hot second.
[02:55:39.447 --> 02:55:41.708]  What do you want your takeaway to be in this last minute?
[02:55:42.988 --> 02:55:44.729]  This is what I really want everybody to know.
[02:55:44.909 --> 02:55:50.730]  We live in a country, you and I do, Kate, who actually pronounces or proclaims themselves to be Pentecostals.
[02:55:51.190 --> 02:56:00.253]  Believers in God, that He created these amazing bodies and saved this amazing creation for the last day of His creative period, Day 6.
[02:56:01.755 --> 02:56:10.657]  He created a perfect body with an immune system in it, I believe, that is far superior to any artificial immunity man can come up with in a lab.
[02:56:11.317 --> 02:56:23.860]  In fact, right now, if any of you go to brownstone.org, brownstone.org, Paul Elias Alexander, PhD, has a list compiled.
[02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:23.860]  110.
[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:28.000]  There are actual research peer-reviewed studies.
[02:56:28.020 --> 02:56:41.393]   110 studies proving Natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection is far superior and long-lasting to any COVID-19 vaccine immunity.
[02:56:42.114 --> 02:56:43.855]  I don't know how many studies you need, but this is 110.
[02:56:43.895 --> 02:56:47.516]  Thank you.
[02:56:47.596 --> 02:56:53.880]  Dr. Brian Artis, TheDrArtisShow.com, and I'm Kate Daly from TheKateDalyShow.com.

[02:57:26.121 --> 02:57:33.389]  He heard me on air a few months ago talking about the fact that we have trouble having enough capital to buy enough product into the future.
[02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:37.394]  And so we run out of things, especially with the supply chain breakdowns.
[02:57:37.414 --> 02:57:39.056]  He said, listen, I'll go in.

[02:58:53.057 --> 02:59:00.477]   products at huge discounts at 50percentoff.com and help support the InfoWar. I am a worldly person,
[02:59:00.477 --> 02:59:02.487]  meaning I like going to ball games.
[02:59:02.701 --> 02:59:03.883]  I like going to concerts.
[02:59:04.063 --> 02:59:05.264]  I like going to play golf.
[02:59:05.404 --> 02:59:06.565]  I like going out to dinner.
[02:59:07.226 --> 02:59:08.787]  I like the metropolitan life.
[02:59:08.807 --> 02:59:10.869]  I like everything that comes with this.
[02:59:11.170 --> 02:59:19.398]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[02:59:19.958 --> 02:59:23.142]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[02:59:23.482 --> 02:59:25.245]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[02:59:25.305 --> 02:59:27.347]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[02:59:27.427 --> 02:59:28.348]  Just get off grid?
[02:59:28.368 --> 02:59:29.810]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:30.731]  Just live off the land?
[02:59:30.931 --> 02:59:32.293]  That's the survival instinct.
[02:59:32.333 --> 02:59:36.598]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[02:59:37.199 --> 02:59:37.940]  Stay in the city.
[02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:42.825]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere that would ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[02:59:43.126 --> 02:59:49.253]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[02:59:49.593 --> 02:59:54.038]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[02:59:54.338 --> 02:59:56.040]  And so we have the best ones at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:58.795 --> 03:00:01.398]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever.

[03:00:35.072 --> 03:00:39.436]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.

[03:01:04.224 --> 03:01:16.328]  It seems just like a week ago that we were in October 2020 and we were launching that very popular yearly sale we've been doing well now for nine years this year and that's Black Friday comes early.

[03:01:29.855 --> 03:01:34.701]  We have store-wide free shipping, we have double Patriot points, and here's the new sales.
