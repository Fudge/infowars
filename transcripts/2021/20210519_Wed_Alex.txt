[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:12.121]  Let's start at the very top of the safety data sheet where it says it is for research purposes only and not to be used on humans.
[00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.385]  Right out of the gates, right there in the document.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.462]  And let's go ahead and read over what this thing does.
[00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:21.023]  Suspected of causing cancer.
[00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:24.825]  Suspected of damaging fertility and the unborn child.
[00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:32.630]  Causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver, and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.
[00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:43.877]  And I want you to take two shots of this and then recurring booster shots mixed in with other things the body is creating an immunity to, which a lot of scientists say will then create an autoimmune response to this chemical.
[00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:45.638]  So very, very serious.
[00:00:46.713 --> 00:01:09.388]  Hazard determining components of labeling and then it goes on to say that it's highly toxic, fatal in contact with skin, causes skin irritation, causes serious eye irritation, suspected of damaging fertility of the unborn child, causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, liver, respiratory system through prolonged repeated exposure, harmful to aquatic life,
[00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:12.770]  Very toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects.
[00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.072]  Obtain special instructions before use.
[00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:19.295]  Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood.
[00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:24.198]  They don't tell you this when you go get to Walgreens or when you go to Walmart or you go to CVS.
[00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:29.882]  Keep container tightly closed and it just goes on from there.
[00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:30.903]  Do not breathe.
[00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:34.426]  Do not get in your eyes or skin or clothing.
[00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.807]  Wash thoroughly after handling.
[00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:38.488]  Do not eat, drink, or smoke.
[00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.713]  When using this product, avoid releasing into the environment, much less into people.
[00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:48.215]  Wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection when you do use it.
[00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:52.516]  If swallowed, call a poison center doctor if you feel unwell.
[00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:56.958]  So, folks are getting sick, collapsing, having heart attacks, the rest of it, this is just one reason.
[00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just the first page.
[00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.480]  Okay?
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.761]  So, again, that's page one.
[00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.622]  It's the first page actually getting into it all.
[00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:08.023]  I've got page three.
[00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:11.916]  And I've got page four.
[00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:18.858]  There's 11 pages of this, and I've only scratched the tip.
[00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:24.120]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:31.022]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is May 19th, 2021.
[00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:36.064]  This is the kickoff of this historic edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.481]  First off, I want you to understand something.
[00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:50.007]  We've broken a lot of huge news together as the InfoWars family with our guests, our researchers, and callers, putting us on to very important leads that have been critical to getting a clear picture of what's happening.
[00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:59.732]  But now, 16 months after this globalist assault that was the COVID-19 fear weapon, all the dots are being connected, the planets are aligning, and we're figuring out exactly what happened.
[00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:05.615]  We're going to air, next segment, a report from internal documents in the state of Connecticut
[00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:21.456]  Confirming for the world with documents out of Michigan, Connecticut, and internationally that the government of Connecticut knows that a chemical being put in the Moderna vaccine as one of the lipids to carry the RNA into the cell
[00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:30.088]  is actually extremely deadly and causes cancer, even causes death, and is linked directly to infertility in women and men.
[00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.613]  That bombshell of bombshell information, with all the documents, is going to be premiering next segment.
[00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:41.638]  The full article and video is already on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:42.778]  Get it, share it now.
[00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:49.964]  We also have a top communist academic that advises the equivalent of their Pentagon, their Army and Naval and Air Force War College.
[00:03:50.965 --> 00:04:01.812]  Saying China has won the 21st century war with a bio-attack and that working with their influencers and change agents in our media in Hollywood, they kept us locked down and will keep us locked down in the future.
[00:04:02.172 --> 00:04:03.553]  They were only locked down for a couple months.
[00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:07.475]  And of course Bill Gates pointed that out that China won the war and China's good and we're bad.
[00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:11.178]  And he helped run that with the UN and the head of the WHO.
[00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.152]  So COVID's a real weapon, but it only kills the old people that don't have vitamins and minerals.
[00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:19.495]  But the fear of it is the real weapon to shut down society.
[00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:28.322]  Then the triple hit, or the third blow, is that the vaccine isn't a vaccine, and it causes all sorts of autoimmune responses and other serious illnesses, heart attacks.
[00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:30.263]  The lungs get eaten.
[00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:35.227]  Then they say that you are testing positive for COVID, put you in the hospital, you die.
[00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:36.488]  And they say COVID did it.
[00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:37.649]  This is incredible.
[00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.711]  I mean, this is 21st century bio-warfare.
[00:04:40.973 --> 00:04:48.819]  Hidden as a so-called virus that came from a wet market when it came out of the Fauci Gates-funded, UN-funded lab working with the Communist Chinese military.
[00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.241]  So, they had us at first, but now the world's awakening to this.
[00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.082]  It's so huge.
[00:04:53.622 --> 00:05:01.288]  All those articles about the Chinese academic bragging, all the articles and videos about this deadly chemical that they knowingly put in the vaccine.
[00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:06.533]  That's illegal to do so is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:15.822]  And then Owen Schroeder after this first big segment that's coming up, segment two, will take over for the rest of the hour and the rest of the show.
[00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:19.646]  But I'm begging you for myself, my family, your family, everybody together.
[00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:20.667]  It's a team effort.
[00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.488]  I run into so many listeners on the ground.
[00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:26.293]  But I'm on a workcation in Florida who are listeners.
[00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:29.253]  I mean, we're talking, I'll be on the beach, everybody coming by is a listener.
[00:05:29.513 --> 00:05:30.733]  Black, white, old, young, you name it.
[00:05:30.753 --> 00:05:33.394]  And they're like, Alex, you know, we barely find you anymore.
[00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:34.174]  Are you still on air?
[00:05:34.194 --> 00:05:37.535]  And I'm like, yes, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Man.Video.
[00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:38.795]  And they go, yeah, we see clips here and there.
[00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:41.136]  And I just tell them, listen, don't thank me.
[00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:42.556]  I'm asking you to take action.
[00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:44.036]  Share those every time you get them.
[00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:46.577]  And they say, I do most of the time, but I'll redouble my efforts.
[00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.117]  So great job, folks.
[00:05:48.137 --> 00:05:49.397]  You're just as important as I am.
[00:05:49.897 --> 00:05:50.938]  Get this information out.
[00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:52.578]  Share the video about
[00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:57.799]  Connecticut admitting there's deadly chemicals in the vaccine and that Bill Gates funded the Moderna vaccine.
[00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.999]  That is on Bandai Video.
[00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:10.522]  And again, just tell everybody you know, tune in right now, take the live links from Bandai Video and InfoWars.com and share them and tell folks about those local aminetham stations and then tell them, once they wake up to tell others, that's the shame reaction.
[00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:16.123]  All right, here is Owen Schroeder taking over for a moment and then I'll be back in the next segment with this key report.
[00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:16.523]  Stay with us.
[00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:22.985]  It's incredible.
[00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:25.267]  Big Brother.
[00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:27.009]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.731]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:29.452 --> 00:06:30.933]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:32.295]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:37.541]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.110 --> 00:07:11.156]  You know, with the deadly vaccines and the fake pandemic and everything that's happened there, and then you have the distraction of all this by what's happening in Israel, that nobody's even paying attention to some of the other news, like our elections caught the theft of that, alien technology, the government's admitting there's alien technology stalking military bases, and then the behavior of the president doesn't even get noticed, what he did yesterday at a Ford electric car plant.
[00:07:12.236 --> 00:07:17.039]  We've been working on this story for over a week, and we were set to break it tomorrow.
[00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:25.845]  But we were very excited and pleased to see that Mike Adams, the health ranger, broke it because his scientific background and research is even better than ours.
[00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.386]  He did a great job laying it all out.
[00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:38.253]  The headline is, bombshell Connecticut government secretly tells health care workers COVID vaccines are deadly, but withholds the same information from the public.
[00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:40.813]  The first half of the article is about that.
[00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:42.114]  It's very important.
[00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:49.495]  The part that we were working on is the second part of the article, and quite frankly, I think is the most important part.
[00:07:50.075 --> 00:08:01.017]  And that is, COVID-19 vaccine ingredients include SM-102, a toxic substance known to be harmful to humans and animals.
[00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:05.618]  Now, it's not just the main ingredient in antifreeze.
[00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.259]  We did research on this.
[00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:13.521]  SM-102 is a catchphrase for an entire class of toxic oils.
[00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:30.566]  And in their own internal document that is from the health department, two health department workers, this isn't given to the public, and Connecticut confirms this is a real document, they have the data safety sheet on this that I'm about to read to you now.
[00:08:31.687 --> 00:08:34.167]  The article we just mentioned is at naturalnews.com.
[00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.308]  We'll also post it
[00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:45.818]  Here on Wednesday underneath the live show feed so that you can actually go see this for yourself as well and then hopefully share it.
[00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:48.401]  But whatever you do, go research this for yourself.
[00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:50.844]  Look this up for yourself.
[00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:55.090]  Let me go ahead and show you on screen some close shots
[00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:58.176]  of this again for yourself.
[00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:02.339]  This document is on the Connecticut website but it was not widely distributed.
[00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:07.303]  They may try to take it down so for those purposes we have mirrored it on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:10.345]  It's also mirrored on NaturalNews.com.
[00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:20.172]  So it goes into telling you that it's safe and it's fine and it's something you really need to do but then they have the safety data sheet
[00:09:21.223 --> 00:09:22.384]  That is connected to it.
[00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:27.990]  This is what the health department there in Connecticut, and you better believe your health department, is also aware of.
[00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:42.004]  This is another reason roughly half the health care workers, the scientists, the researchers at the NIH and CDC, thousands testified in Congress last week, have not taken the vaccine, even though they were the first to have it available to them, because they know it's experimental.
[00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:43.425]  It's not really a vaccine.
[00:09:43.725 --> 00:09:44.206]  Trade name,
[00:09:46.727 --> 00:09:51.068]  And again, it has a very, very long, complex name that we've got on screen for you.
[00:09:51.148 --> 00:09:57.510]  It's article number, so you can look it up for yourself, is 33474.
[00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.510]  33474.
[00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:09.693]  Let's start at the very top of the safety data sheet where it says it is for research purposes only and not to be used on humans.
[00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:12.934]  Right out of the gates, right there in the document.
[00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:17.018]  And let's go ahead and read over what this thing does.
[00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:18.579]  Suspected of causing cancer.
[00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:22.381]  Suspected of damaging fertility and the unborn child.
[00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:30.206]  Causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver, and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.
[00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:41.454]  And I want you to take two shots of this and then recurring booster shots mixed in with other things the body is creating an immunity to, which a lot of scientists say will then create an autoimmune response to this chemical.
[00:10:42.214 --> 00:10:43.195]  So very, very serious.
[00:10:44.269 --> 00:11:06.947]  Hazard Determining Components of Labeling, and then it goes on to say that it's highly toxic, fatal in contact with skin, causes skin irritation, causes serious eye irritation, suspected of damaging fertility of the unborn child, causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, liver, respiratory system through prolonged, repeated exposure, harmful to aquatic life,
[00:11:07.828 --> 00:11:10.330]  Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects.
[00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:12.632]  Obtain special instructions before use.
[00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:16.856]  Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood.
[00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:21.760]  They don't tell you this when you go get to Walgreens or when you go to Walmart or you go to CVS.
[00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:27.444]  Keep container tightly closed and it just goes on from there.
[00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:28.465]  Do not breathe.
[00:11:29.426 --> 00:11:31.988]  Do not get it in your eyes or skin or clothing.
[00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:34.370]  Wash thoroughly after handling.
[00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.051]  Do not eat, drink or smoke.
[00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:41.291]  When using this product, avoid releasing into the environment, much less into people.
[00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:45.775]  Wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection when you do use it.
[00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:50.078]  If swallowed, call a poison center doctor if you feel unwell.
[00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:54.522]  So, folks are getting sick, collapsing, having heart attacks, the rest of it, this is just one reason.
[00:11:55.502 --> 00:11:57.444]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just the first page.
[00:11:57.464 --> 00:11:59.045]  Okay?
[00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.348]  So, again, that's page one.
[00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:04.209]  It's the first page actually getting into it all.
[00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.951]  I've got page three.
[00:12:08.476 --> 00:12:09.456]  And I've got page four.
[00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:19.001]  There's 11 pages of this, and I've only scratched the tip of the iceberg for you on this.
[00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.923]  And I'm just continually absolutely stunned.
[00:12:23.323 --> 00:12:36.210]  Oh, and by the way, they list the other things that are in this vaccine, and two of the others are also dangerous industrial oils that they say in small amounts are extremely toxic.
[00:12:37.162 --> 00:12:46.568]  And that's how they deliver the nanotech-sized RNA into your cells to reprogram them with a spike protein, which your body also has an autoimmune response to.
[00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.751]  They're going for broke.
[00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:52.932]  This is totally insane.
[00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:54.553]  It doesn't protect you from COVID.
[00:12:54.593 --> 00:13:00.056]  Most people in the hospital dying from COVID now, they admit are there from COVID vaccines.
[00:13:00.817 --> 00:13:05.720]  Everyone has to get this report and send it out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and then send them a link
[00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:16.228]  to this industrial extremely dangerous chemical SCM-102 from the safety data sheet.
[00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:20.329]  There are thousands of copies of this safety data sheet online.
[00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:34.194]  The one that we pulled up and I'll link to the article is safety data sheet from OSHA HCS and this is out of the Cayman Islands where it's this particular chemicals being manufactured but it's manufactured other places.
[00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:36.453]  As well.
[00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:38.715]  Again, I'm a father.
[00:13:39.556 --> 00:13:40.097]  I'm a human.
[00:13:40.377 --> 00:13:41.018]  I have parents.
[00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:44.461]  I'm watching people all around me get sick and die from the so-called vaccines.
[00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:48.464]  You ask, how are they going to get away with this?
[00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:49.685]  Well, the answer is they're not.
[00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:53.689]  But they did get away with tens of millions people being autistic from vaccines.
[00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.371]  And now that was all coming out.
[00:13:56.431 --> 00:13:58.013]  So this was supposed to be an even bigger event.
[00:13:59.386 --> 00:14:05.288]  So we forget the old event, and then there'll be an even bigger event coming in the future, Bill Gates said, where, quote, terrorists release a bioweapon.
[00:14:05.328 --> 00:14:12.170]  And we've also got Bill Gates saying that we need to depopulate the Earth at the same time.
[00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:18.171]  So when you've got somebody saying they want to depopulate you, but they really want to put something in your body, you should put two and two together.
[00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:22.492]  Paul Joseph Watts did a big story about Klaus Schwab that heads up the Economic Forum at Davos.
[00:14:23.253 --> 00:14:24.553]  He's Henry Kissinger's frontman.
[00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:30.657]  And Paul Watson said, why is he so concerned about having more gay characters on TV?
[00:14:30.677 --> 00:14:38.425]  Because only 10% of characters on TV are gay, when only roughly 5% of the world population, quote, identifies as gay, up from 1% a few years ago.
[00:14:38.865 --> 00:14:40.206]  And it's because of depopulation.
[00:14:40.707 --> 00:14:43.590]  I don't hate somebody because of their, quote, sexual preference.
[00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:57.614]  But when they're organized by media and government for depopulation, there's a war on the family, and a war on the nuclear family, and Black Lives Matter says we want to get rid of the nuclear family, and want to sterilize black men, and trans men, black men are the most important thing.
[00:14:58.754 --> 00:15:00.735]  It's not even 2 plus 2 equals tyranny, it's
[00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.832]  Just on its face, they're doing this.
[00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:06.174]  It's not even a calculation to know they're doing it.
[00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:08.517]  They're telling us it's about depopulation.
[00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:11.000]  And that's why it attacks their fertility.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.782]  That's why it attacks the rest of the body.
[00:15:12.802 --> 00:15:20.810]  And that's why it causes us horrible autoimmune disorders as this lipid, this oil, is delivering this through your cell membrane.
[00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:23.612]  So again, we're going to post this to Band-Odd Video.
[00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:26.514]  Remember, Big Tech is censoring and blocking all this.
[00:15:26.574 --> 00:15:28.915]  They are committing war crimes against humanity.
[00:15:29.255 --> 00:15:36.980]  They are violating the Nuremberg Code, right along with Big Pharma, in their attempts to suppress the medical workers and scientists and others that have been out exposing this.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:43.964]  I know Owen has a very special medical doctor joining him today, who's also been persecuted and attacked for telling the truth.
[00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:47.298]  Those famous press conferences in front of the U.S.
[00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:47.758]  Capitol.
[00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.739]  And so I'll leave that to Owen to tell you who's coming out.
[00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:53.520]  It's going to be extremely informative and extremely powerful.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.881]  But I wanted to kick the main broadcast off the day with this information.
[00:15:57.441 --> 00:16:01.622]  I also just talked to Mike Adams and he's going to be able to pop on the broadcast as well.
[00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:10.345]  And again, he owns a biochemical research laboratory and really is at another level when it comes to understanding all this than even I am.
[00:16:10.725 --> 00:16:13.446]  I'm just going off the mainline research and what other medical doctors
[00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:14.247]  Yes, we are!
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.001]  The debate that was had a long time ago
[00:16:58.442 --> 00:17:09.828]  That you were not told about, that overall we, the people of planet Earth, were not told about, was are there too many humans?
[00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.050]  Are we going to kill the planet?
[00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:23.515]  And do we need to run an operation to depopulate and keep the human population of Earth down to a minimum?
[00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:35.914]  And at a more deep level than that is the debate of what is it about humans?
[00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.034]  Why are we different?
[00:17:38.716 --> 00:17:45.060]  And so the elite that want to keep the human population at a low, they know about divine intervention.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.902]  They know there's something special about humanity.
[00:17:47.062 --> 00:17:48.423]  That's an obvious one.
[00:17:49.431 --> 00:17:51.013]  But they don't want you to know that.
[00:17:51.054 --> 00:17:52.816]  They don't want you to know you're special.
[00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:55.741]  They don't want you to know that God has a plan for you.
[00:17:55.761 --> 00:17:56.843]  There is a grand design.
[00:17:57.123 --> 00:17:58.004]  There is a creator.
[00:17:58.806 --> 00:18:00.388]  This is an incredible consciousness.
[00:18:00.428 --> 00:18:01.690]  This is a gift from God.
[00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:03.693]  This is a human experience.
[00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:04.575]  This is divine.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:22.385]  So first they realize, they know it, anybody who wants to be realistic, doesn't mean you believe in one religion or the other, you're just realistic, this is, we are created, there was divine intervention, something separates human from every other form of life and consciousness that we know of.
[00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:31.788]  So once that conclusion was reached by the Illuminati, the elite, you can either share that with the rest of the world, or you can try to keep the world in the dark.
[00:18:33.188 --> 00:18:41.737]  That's the next level, or the level behind the level we're at now, which is, there was a debate had, do we have to keep Earth's population at a minimum?
[00:18:41.977 --> 00:18:53.608]  And then you see public documents about this, and you have statues like the Georgia Guidestones about this, and now you're living it.
[00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:56.892]  But the debate is,
[00:18:58.897 --> 00:19:06.140]  Not just do we have to maintain the human population below a certain level, if you follow the Georgia Guidestones, I think it's 500 million on Earth is the maximum level.
[00:19:10.242 --> 00:19:13.943]  How do you justify running such an operation?
[00:19:17.805 --> 00:19:24.028]  And there's a bunch of different justifications you could use and it's, there's all kinds of different levels of
[00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:54.507]  Humanity or empathy or morals that you could go through to guide you, but ultimately it's the classic form of karma or the metaphysical universe where, as is tradition in Satanism, when applied to a group of people, as long as you tell somebody what you're going to do to them and then they accept it,
[00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:59.904]  Which is even a form of common law, then you're not liable.
[00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:01.245]  You're not guilty.
[00:20:01.465 --> 00:20:02.365]  You shouldn't feel bad.
[00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:25.396]  So the conversation that happened was, if, if, whether it's the Chinese communists or the United States government, or something above board of that, or the medical industry, big pharma institutions, if they're all part of a population control agenda,
[00:20:27.298 --> 00:20:38.626]  They have a vaccine that's gonna be the keystone, that's gonna be the cornerstone to, or just vaccines in general, or whatever the medical industry, medical tyranny is pushing.
[00:20:39.386 --> 00:20:41.948]  Right now it's the vaccines, maybe it's microchips later, whatever.
[00:20:42.268 --> 00:20:43.169]  Right now it's the vaccines.
[00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:54.177]  And they figure, well look, if we put out a vaccine, and we've done no human testing, we've done animal testing, it kills all the animals,
[00:20:55.373 --> 00:21:00.037]  We put adjuvants and ingredients in the vaccine that we know are deadly.
[00:21:00.257 --> 00:21:01.679]  We put the ingredients out.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:09.846]  So it's like, hey, if I come up to you with a gun and a bullet in the chamber and say, this is loaded, can I blow your brains out?
[00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:12.068]  And they say, yeah, blow my brains out.
[00:21:12.088 --> 00:21:13.249]  And then boom, you blow them out.
[00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:14.190]  Do you feel guilty?
[00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.831]  No, the globalists don't think so.
[00:21:15.872 --> 00:21:17.293]  The world elite don't think so.
[00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:19.174]  They think that that's justified.
[00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:25.879]  Hundreds of millions of Americans, billions of people, line up to get the vaccine?
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.221]  I got a free donut!
[00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:28.261]  I got a free beer!
[00:21:30.603 --> 00:21:47.917]  The way Bill Gates, for example, probably looks at that is says, if you're that dumb, that I can lure you into a death trap, lure you into a possible deadly scenario, with a free donut or a free cheeseburger or a free basket of fries, then you deserve to die!
[00:21:48.838 --> 00:21:49.899]  Survival of the fittest!
[00:21:54.266 --> 00:22:09.489]  And once you can boil down to that key understanding of planet Earth in the year 2021, and then you can exponentially apply that to everything else you're seeing, it starts to make sense.
[00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:14.910]  You become a master builder, as they say in the popular Lego movie.
[00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:20.111]  Or in the They Live scenario, that's when you put the glasses on.
[00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:22.752]  Or in the Matrix scenario, that's when you take the red pill.
[00:22:24.454 --> 00:22:27.435]  And then everything starts to make sense, and then you can start to apply that.
[00:22:29.615 --> 00:22:53.879]  But until you've accepted that that's the reality, until you understand that's the planet you live on, until you start to put two and two together and realize, yeah, there's all this corruption on planet Earth, none of this seems to make sense, but then you can trace it back to that core operating system running the planet, then you can start to make sense of it.
[00:22:56.613 --> 00:22:59.535]  But maybe, maybe we've been taking the wrong approach here.
[00:23:02.177 --> 00:23:07.701]  Maybe we should be having the debate that was already had instead of saying, hey, these vaccines are deadly.
[00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:09.662]  Hey, look at all the people that are dying.
[00:23:12.144 --> 00:23:13.625]  I mean, look, we can go back.
[00:23:15.621 --> 00:23:29.509]  Uh, intellectually, which is not even ancient history, but I mean, it's still like the last level that we didn't even win, which is, hey look, you know how much money has been blown up in the middle of the air above Israel?
[00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:35.233]  Yeah, tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars actually, yeah, just blown up over the sky.
[00:23:35.993 --> 00:23:37.414]  People getting paid millions of dollars for that.
[00:23:37.434 --> 00:23:38.215]  That's war.
[00:23:38.455 --> 00:23:39.916]  That's that old thing called war.
[00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:41.017]  War is a racket.
[00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:41.998]  Smedley Butler, 1942.
[00:23:42.598 --> 00:23:44.840]  Yeah, that old population control.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.300]  War.
[00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:46.942]  Yeah, that's an old one.
[00:23:46.962 --> 00:23:48.363]  Again, we didn't figure that out.
[00:23:48.383 --> 00:23:49.324]  We're still fighting wars.
[00:23:49.364 --> 00:23:49.864]  Okay, fine.
[00:23:51.505 --> 00:23:59.432]  And the elites are still making hundreds of millions of dollars blowing up rockets over Israel and distracting us with that ancient tribalism that happens there.
[00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.295]  Which, by the way, we've got a big announcement about that.
[00:24:05.734 --> 00:24:08.135]  I'll announce coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:08.935 --> 00:24:12.456]  But maybe we should just have the debate.
[00:24:12.756 --> 00:24:15.937]  Should we be purging the planet of billions of people?
[00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:19.699]  I know people that have gotten the vaccine.
[00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:21.379]  I have friends that have gotten the vaccine.
[00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:22.500]  I wish they would have listened to me.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.840]  Some of them say, hey, I feel sick now.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.781]  Wish I would have listened to you.
[00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:27.981]  Okay, I mean, what do you want?
[00:24:28.982 --> 00:24:31.843]  You listen to Bill Gates, the guy that said he wants to depopulate the planet.
[00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:32.843]  It's your choice.
[00:24:34.735 --> 00:24:35.955]  But that still breaks my heart.
[00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:37.136]  But maybe that's the thing.
[00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:38.596]  Maybe we need to change our tactic.
[00:24:38.636 --> 00:24:40.697]  Not saying, look, the vaccines are deadly!
[00:24:40.717 --> 00:24:43.978]  Or look, war's a racket!
[00:24:44.058 --> 00:24:45.299]  You know, that didn't catch on.
[00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:48.080]  So maybe it's, let's just have the debate!
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.042]  Maybe we should just have the debate that the secret government, shadow government, World Reliefs had years ago.
[00:24:54.402 --> 00:24:56.223]  Hey, should we be culling the population?
[00:24:56.243 --> 00:24:57.203]  Are there too much humans?
[00:24:57.383 --> 00:24:58.924]  Should we kill billions of people?
[00:24:59.424 --> 00:25:01.625]  Because some people have already made that decision for you.
[00:25:05.572 --> 00:25:13.077]  But I'm going to make a big announcement when we come back on the other side of this segment, and we're going to open the phone lines for the topic that we discussed yesterday.
[00:25:13.117 --> 00:25:14.498]  Don't go anywhere, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:15.458 --> 00:25:23.223]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here, hosting the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, May 19th.
[00:25:25.985 --> 00:25:34.491]  It's hard to even stay focused on the news, just with everything going on, and the epicness, quite frankly, of the InfoWars platform right now.
[00:25:35.489 --> 00:25:38.653]  And I mean, I'm just like, I don't know, like a deer in the headlights.
[00:25:39.774 --> 00:25:41.196]  But here's what I'm going to do.
[00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:45.822]  I'm going to give you a program note of what's coming up on the show for the rest of the day here.
[00:25:47.303 --> 00:25:52.810]  So we've got Dr. Stella Emanuel joining me in the third hour.
[00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.992]  That's the one o'clock hour.
[00:25:55.755 --> 00:26:06.338]  And then we're going to have some special reports in the final hour today from Alex Jones and an unseen, unaired interview of Darren McBreen and Larry Pinckney, one of the founders of the Black Panthers.
[00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:11.319]  That's going to be in the fourth hour after Stella Emanuel joins us, the great doctor.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.222]  I'll also be hosting the War Room again today, and we've got great guests coming on the War Room like Dan Lyman.
[00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.363]  And is it, was it Mike Adams on the second hour, guys?
[00:26:26.664 --> 00:26:30.605]  I think it's Mike Adams and he's got breaking news at naturalnews.com.
[00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:33.587]  So it's just loaded coming up today at InfoWars.
[00:26:36.007 --> 00:26:48.572]  Now I've got an announcement to make and I'm also going to open up the phone lines and we're going to take nothing but calls on a specific subject that we told you about yesterday in the second hour.
[00:26:50.173 --> 00:26:52.754]  But before I do that, let me just take care of a couple things.
[00:26:52.994 --> 00:26:53.574]  First of all,
[00:26:56.001 --> 00:27:00.945]  Well, let me do this first and announce, just let me just make the big announcement here.
[00:27:02.427 --> 00:27:02.587]  So...
[00:27:04.537 --> 00:27:07.399]  We're about to do something that should be the norm.
[00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:09.261]  This should be happening every night.
[00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:18.588]  Other news stations, other media outlets, other broadcast transmission hubs should be doing the exact same thing that we're about to be doing next week every night.
[00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:26.234]  It shouldn't just be InfoWars having to take all these burdens with our crew here on our battered mothership.
[00:27:26.274 --> 00:27:29.796]  But, you know, just like the Millennium Falcon, we just keep going into every battle.
[00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:33.079]  So next Tuesday,
[00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:39.587]  We are launching the first, this could become a series, the first The Great Debate.
[00:27:40.268 --> 00:27:41.849]  Middle East in Crisis.
[00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:47.651]  And right now the plan is for myself and Alex Jones and Harrison Smith to be the moderators.
[00:27:48.032 --> 00:27:50.553]  Like they have moderators, multiple moderators for presidential debates.
[00:27:51.113 --> 00:27:54.375]  And it will be Nick Fuentes and Robert Barnes.
[00:27:55.498 --> 00:27:57.060]  So, the first of maybe a series.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.321]  We may make a series out of this.
[00:27:58.421 --> 00:27:59.142]  I think it would be great.
[00:27:59.182 --> 00:28:01.584]  We'll be filling a void that nobody else seems to want to fill.
[00:28:01.985 --> 00:28:04.067]  Even though our crew already works like 15 hours a day.
[00:28:04.127 --> 00:28:04.988]  But, you know, that's fine.
[00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:05.589]  Seven days a week.
[00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.692]  The Great Debate Middle East in Crisis.
[00:28:08.932 --> 00:28:12.336]  Next Tuesday evening, May 25th, 6pm.
[00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:14.278]  So that's directly following the War Room.
[00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:17.061]  Nick Fuentes vs. Bob Barnes.
[00:28:18.288 --> 00:28:21.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, we should be having debates like this every night.
[00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:28.373]  Now, Nick Fuentes and Bob Barnes probably agree on most things, but they disagree on what's happening right now in Israel.
[00:28:28.433 --> 00:28:29.473]  I think it's going to be a great debate.
[00:28:30.213 --> 00:28:34.315]  And they both have respect for one another, so it's going to be cordial, but it's going to be passionate.
[00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:35.536]  And I'm looking forward to that.
[00:28:36.567 --> 00:28:40.968]  And I'm looking forward to moderating it, and the exclusive link is greatdebate.news.
[00:28:41.008 --> 00:28:42.769]  Now, this could become a series we end up doing here.
[00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.189]  But you notice how you don't have political debates anymore.
[00:28:46.229 --> 00:28:47.810]  They canceled the presidential debates.
[00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.251]  Democrats and Republicans never have debates.
[00:28:51.671 --> 00:28:55.432]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, AOC, agreed to debate her and then bailed out of that.
[00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:58.493]  So, I mean, nobody wants to have these debates.
[00:28:58.993 --> 00:29:03.314]  So, again, if InfoWars has to fill that void again and push that ball again, we'll do it.
[00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.092]  So, we've launched GreatDebate.News and this will be the first in potentially a series.
[00:29:08.132 --> 00:29:14.534]  We'll see the Great Debate, Middle Eastern Crisis, Nick Fuentes and Bob Barnes next Tuesday evening, 6 p.m.
[00:29:14.574 --> 00:29:16.955]  Central, following the InfoWars War Room.
[00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:19.576]  I wish we'd have more debate.
[00:29:19.636 --> 00:29:21.157]  I wish the left and the right would debate.
[00:29:21.257 --> 00:29:22.457]  We need to have more discussion.
[00:29:22.497 --> 00:29:23.378]  We need to debate these issues.
[00:29:23.398 --> 00:29:28.059]  Of course, we know why liberals won't debate, because they are clueless on the issues and they know they would lose the debates.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.021]  But, the irony of this is that
[00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:44.696]  The whole reason why we reached this point with Fuentes and Barnes coming up is because Dave Rubin blocked Nick Fuentes on Twitter when he asked him to have a debate with him on the Middle Eastern crisis.
[00:29:45.536 --> 00:29:48.537]  So now you have censors on the right just like you do on the left.
[00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:52.519]  And you have people that are afraid of free speech on the right just like you have them on the left.
[00:29:53.179 --> 00:29:55.840]  So that's not a very good sign at all.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.141]  But there you go.
[00:29:59.195 --> 00:30:05.659]  This is only possible for us to do stuff like this with your financial support at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:07.099]  Period.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:14.043]  And we're already at full capacity here, as far as the operating capacity, the staff capacity.
[00:30:14.083 --> 00:30:17.165]  I mean, quite frankly, we need more, but we're at budget capacity as well.
[00:30:18.345 --> 00:30:24.889]  Now, Alex is out of town, and so I don't have to explain to you how funds go down when Alex takes a vacation.
[00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:26.190]  That's why a neighbor takes a vacation.
[00:30:27.023 --> 00:30:39.168]  I know, I'm not Alex Jones, most people tune out when they hear my voice, and most people just aren't familiar with me like they are Alex, so when we talk about InfoWarsTore.com it doesn't have near the effect.
[00:30:39.188 --> 00:30:48.492]  But folks, go to InfoWarsTore.com, do Alex a vacation favor, make him feel more comfortable about going on vacation and having me in the chair here running things.
[00:30:49.873 --> 00:30:51.474]  Buy something at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:30:51.494 --> 00:30:52.594]  Spend 50 bucks.
[00:30:52.634 --> 00:30:53.314]  Spend 100 bucks.
[00:30:53.334 --> 00:30:54.255]  Spend 200 bucks.
[00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:59.196]  Let Alex come back from his vacation and see that the coffers were filled while he was gone.
[00:30:59.636 --> 00:31:01.897]  Give him some peace of mind, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:02.477 --> 00:31:04.518]  Get the new Fizzy Magnesium Formula.
[00:31:05.218 --> 00:31:07.879]  Get the new Ultimate Fish Oil 50% off.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.021]  Get Winter Sun Plus, which we still have in stock, 50% off.
[00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:13.812]  I don't know.
[00:31:29.747 --> 00:31:36.409]  Your financial support, your word of mouth, and your prayers are what keep us on air.
[00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:39.330]  And so, look, again, nobody else wants to have these debates.
[00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.911]  I mean, we're not cable news here.
[00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:44.132]  We don't have unlimited funding.
[00:31:45.752 --> 00:31:51.394]  We're not, you know, we're not embraced and promoted by the mainstream establishment, but
[00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:55.543]  No, you notice you don't see political debate happening anywhere.
[00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:56.263]  You notice that.
[00:31:56.283 --> 00:31:58.985]  I mean, political debate should be like number one.
[00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:00.986]  It'd be the number one rated thing on TV.
[00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:03.967]  It's the number one thing our country needs, and you don't get it.
[00:32:04.508 --> 00:32:08.870]  So InfoWars will deliver on that again next Tuesday night.
[00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:15.434]  Nick Fuentes, Bob Barnes, The Great Debate, Middle East in Crisis, moderated by Alex Jones, myself, and Harrison Smith.
[00:32:15.794 --> 00:32:20.917]  Now, in the next segment, I'm going to try to cover all of this news I have on my desk.
[00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:23.754]  It probably won't even be possible.
[00:32:25.575 --> 00:32:43.544]  But I'm going to give out the phone number and in the second hour today, the entirety of the second hour, so starting with the 12.06 noon central segment all the way through to 1.06 when Dr. Stella Emanuel is going to be joining me, I want to take your calls specifically on this issue.
[00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:46.145]  So we're going to really screen the phone calls.
[00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:47.866]  We only want people to call in on this issue.
[00:32:49.275 --> 00:32:53.316]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take the COVID vaccine?
[00:32:55.197 --> 00:32:59.038]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take the COVID vaccine?
[00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:03.440]  Now this could be small business, big business, major corporation, whatever.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.921]  Is your place of employment forcing you to take a vaccine?
[00:33:08.521 --> 00:33:14.784]  Or do you own a business and you're deciding not to force your employees or you're saying your employees can't take the vaccine?
[00:33:14.804 --> 00:33:15.804]  I actually know people like that.
[00:33:17.637 --> 00:33:19.517]  Or are you telling people to take the vaccine and why?
[00:33:19.558 --> 00:33:23.178]  So, for the entire second hour, that's going to be the subject of discussion.
[00:33:23.198 --> 00:33:23.739]  The number is 877-789-2539.
[00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:23.799]  877-789-2539.
[00:33:23.819 --> 00:33:30.580]  Is your employer forcing you to take a COVID vaccine, or if you own and run a business, are you forcing your employees to take the vaccine?
[00:33:42.393 --> 00:33:48.418]  And then, for the employees that are being forced to take a vaccine, what are you going to do?
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.201]  Are you going to take legal action?
[00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:53.843]  Are you going to fight back and just say no?
[00:33:53.863 --> 00:33:55.524]  Are you going to try to explain to them why?
[00:33:55.544 --> 00:33:56.125]  Are you going to quit?
[00:33:56.225 --> 00:33:57.786]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:33:58.627 --> 00:33:59.908]  So the phone lines are now open.
[00:33:59.928 --> 00:33:59.968]  877-789-2539.
[00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.973]  Is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine and what are you going to do?
[00:34:08.053 --> 00:34:18.083]  Now, I'm not going to be able to, I'm not going to start taking calls until six after the noon hour, because when we come back in the next segment, I've got to cover this news.
[00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:19.424]  And I won't even get to all of it.
[00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:25.470]  And quite frankly, I should, but we really want to open up the phones on this issue and hear from you.
[00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:30.195]  Cause like I said, just one of those things that we have to do that nobody else will.
[00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:34.468]  So nobody else wants to host and promote political debates?
[00:34:34.808 --> 00:34:35.229]  We will.
[00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:41.435]  Nobody else wants to go to the public to figure out what's going on with the vaccines being forced on employees?
[00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.237]  We do and we will.
[00:34:44.098 --> 00:34:47.161]  But after this short break, I'm going to get to all the breaking news stories.
[00:34:48.122 --> 00:34:51.305]  So once again, in the next hour, we're going to be taking your calls.
[00:34:52.654 --> 00:34:54.436]  Is your employer facing you to take a vaccine?
[00:34:54.456 --> 00:34:56.958]  We've got some breaking news even on that subject real quick.
[00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:01.641]  Buffalo Bills GM says team might cut players who refuse COVID vaccine.
[00:35:02.162 --> 00:35:02.602]  Yikes!
[00:35:02.983 --> 00:35:08.267]  By the way, NHL players who got the COVID vaccine are testing positive for COVID and sitting the playoffs out.
[00:35:10.546 --> 00:35:11.366]  A hockey player!
[00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:14.067]  They play with, like, lacerated spleens!
[00:35:14.707 --> 00:35:15.908]  But, oh, they get a little fever.
[00:35:15.928 --> 00:35:18.328]  They have to sit out for COVID after the vaccine.
[00:35:18.629 --> 00:35:22.670]  Florida employers can require a COVID-19 vaccine but can't ask for proof.
[00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.950]  Oh, you love that!
[00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.391]  And so the left is going to be demanding vaccine IDs.
[00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:31.993]  Now, what is the biggest stack of news?
[00:35:32.153 --> 00:35:32.893]  I don't even know.
[00:35:33.353 --> 00:35:35.214]  So, let me just pick one and go through it.
[00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:52.251]  What Joe Biden does is almost completely irrelevant, and quite frankly he does nothing anyway, but he went to a Ford electric car power plant yesterday, and it barely even made the news, and there's a lot of interesting things about this.
[00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.932]  And so it just shows you how they're really pushing electric vehicles.
[00:35:57.112 --> 00:35:57.832]  I don't know why.
[00:35:58.292 --> 00:36:06.394]  The only conclusion I can reach is that they know down the road, and this is why you see with the gas, and they're going to use the gas pipeline outages
[00:36:07.674 --> 00:36:12.776]  As an alley-oop for this, but that's why you're saying, oh, don't you wish you had an electric car?
[00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:15.257]  Well, what powers the electric cars?
[00:36:15.317 --> 00:36:19.479]  Natural gas from the power grid, natural coal burning from the power grid.
[00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:21.440]  So, I mean, it's all a big joke.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.361]  And the lithium mines are much worse than the coal mines.
[00:36:24.381 --> 00:36:27.342]  I mean, they make these movies and everything like the coal mines are the worst thing.
[00:36:27.362 --> 00:36:27.942]  Oh, yeah, really?
[00:36:27.962 --> 00:36:28.743]  Have you seen a lithium mine?
[00:36:29.283 --> 00:36:31.924]  So, Biden goes up there.
[00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:39.595]  To talk about how electric cars are the future, you know, with the gas pipeline outages, everybody wishes they had electric.
[00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:41.717]  And it's all BS.
[00:36:42.558 --> 00:36:44.099]  And by the way, so here's the headlines.
[00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:47.162]  Oh, I love this one.
[00:36:47.723 --> 00:36:55.750]  Biden got to test drive Ford's electric F-150 as the Israel-Gaza fight is going on, but wouldn't spoil his ride.
[00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.572]  And then the media asked him about that and he says, I'll run you over.
[00:36:59.253 --> 00:36:59.593]  Literally.
[00:37:02.214 --> 00:37:06.316]  Biden jokes about mowing down journalists with truck when asked about Israel.
[00:37:06.356 --> 00:37:14.479]  Well, here's the thing, they wouldn't have to ask you as you're going for a joyride in a Ford F-150 if you actually did press conferences, if you ever addressed the thing publicly.
[00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:15.860]  But you never have!
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.782]  So yeah, they have to interrupt you during a nice joyride in a truck because you haven't addressed the issue to the public!
[00:37:22.002 --> 00:37:22.763]  Because you suck!
[00:37:24.163 --> 00:37:26.144]  So that's nice, threatening a journalist to run them over.
[00:37:26.264 --> 00:37:27.885]  That's a good thing for Biden there.
[00:37:29.472 --> 00:37:30.813]  But there's some other interesting things.
[00:37:31.633 --> 00:37:33.874]  Biden also praised China.
[00:37:34.574 --> 00:37:35.274]  I'm not kidding you.
[00:37:35.314 --> 00:37:36.415]  He praised China.
[00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:38.356]  He said China's doing such a good job with this.
[00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:42.257]  China's doing such a good job with electric, which is a lie on multiple fronts.
[00:37:44.038 --> 00:37:45.098]  Breitbart has the story.
[00:37:45.158 --> 00:37:50.480]  Biden in Michigan ignores record allowing China to buy up American electric vehicle industry.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.122]  So yeah, China's doing a good job buying up our electric vehicle industry, but that's not even it.
[00:37:55.373 --> 00:38:01.778]  Biden, first of all, praising China again, because I guess he's the hype man for China now.
[00:38:02.098 --> 00:38:02.538]  As the U.S.
[00:38:02.578 --> 00:38:04.039]  President, he's the hype man for China.
[00:38:06.441 --> 00:38:18.010]  But he also not just is praising China, but he's saying how we need to be mimicking China.
[00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:24.555]  Oh, we need to be mimicking China, says Biden yesterday.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:35.624]  Even though China puts out more carbon emission, more greenhouse gas emission, than every other industrialized country on earth combined.
[00:38:36.004 --> 00:38:48.890]  So Biden doesn't mention that China's buying up our electric vehicle industry, and Biden doesn't mention that China puts out more carbon emissions than every other country on earth combined, but he praises China and says they're doing great with electric and we need to mimic China.
[00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.811]  Disgusting.
[00:38:53.352 --> 00:38:53.492]  As
[00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.990]  Biden is shutting down US pipelines.
[00:38:57.491 --> 00:39:02.332]  He gives the okay for Putin to open another pipeline going into Germany.
[00:39:02.792 --> 00:39:05.452]  Which, to me, I think he's just trying to keep Putin quiet.
[00:39:06.492 --> 00:39:12.794]  Putin could eviscerate Joe Biden tomorrow, but Putin's more interested in keeping Russia strong than destroying Joe Biden.
[00:39:13.414 --> 00:39:16.654]  So Biden figures he could pay him off, I guess, with starting that pipeline back up.
[00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:19.195]  But then...
[00:39:21.323 --> 00:39:29.990]  There's an interesting little ripple here, and you can see it in the video, and I don't know what this is, but other news outlets are reporting on it, including the Gateway Pundit.
[00:39:30.051 --> 00:39:31.732]  Biden caught fake driving.
[00:39:31.892 --> 00:39:33.614]  Someone else is steering vehicle.
[00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:34.795]  It was all a stunt.
[00:39:35.115 --> 00:39:42.782]  And you can see in the video and in pictures that the person in the passenger seat with Joe is clearly grabbing something.
[00:39:43.837 --> 00:39:47.119]  Now, I'm not totally convinced this is a steering wheel.
[00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:48.119]  I mean, this sounds crazy.
[00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:50.841]  I mean, is Joe Biden that out of it that he can't even drive a car?
[00:39:51.201 --> 00:39:52.021]  Maybe, maybe.
[00:39:53.142 --> 00:40:02.887]  But I mean, that's an awful lot of lengths to have like a fake steering wheel, like a driving test or a driving coach vehicle where they have the steering wheel on the right side.
[00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:11.372]  But it does appear that the person in the vehicle with him, as yes, we're rolling the slow motion film here, is steering the vehicle
[00:40:12.486 --> 00:40:24.852]  with a second steering wheel as you can see right there and it I mean it looks like a steering wheel what what could my my other notion is that
[00:40:25.805 --> 00:40:37.396]  The individual who was in the car with Biden was so scared out of his mind that he's in the car with a dementia patient driving at high speeds and now he's next to humans.
[00:40:37.676 --> 00:40:39.918]  He was probably grabbing on, holding on for his life.
[00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:43.381]  If you were in a car with Biden, you'd probably be doing the same thing.
[00:40:44.162 --> 00:40:45.103]  But hey, Biden's cool.
[00:40:45.143 --> 00:40:46.624]  He's got the aviator sunglasses on.
[00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:47.545]  You know, that's his look.
[00:40:48.186 --> 00:40:49.467]  Right before he sniffs your baby.
[00:40:51.084 --> 00:40:52.205]  But see it all comes down to this.
[00:40:53.025 --> 00:40:58.407]  Energy companies must immediately halt all new projects for world to meet Paris Climate Accord target.
[00:40:58.928 --> 00:40:59.828]  Except China!
[00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:01.509]  Except China!
[00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.590]  Except China!
[00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:08.472]  So our coal gets shut off, our natural gas gets shut off.
[00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:13.830]  And we no longer get cheap energy, and we can no longer drive cars.
[00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.292]  And so what they're going to do is, it's all going to be a bait and switch.
[00:41:17.233 --> 00:41:33.786]  Oh, drive electric, drive electric, and it'll probably never happen, but they want to get everybody driving electric, and then once they can reach a certain threshold of electric vehicles on the road, that's when they'll really shut off the gas and coal, and then make it impossible to even drive.
[00:41:33.826 --> 00:41:36.309]  They'll price everybody out of driving, is what they'll do.
[00:41:37.324 --> 00:41:41.646]  And so only the most elite, rich people will be able to drive.
[00:41:41.686 --> 00:41:42.746]  And that's really what they want.
[00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:47.848]  Because driving is one of the great bastions of human freedom that we've ever had.
[00:41:49.209 --> 00:41:52.010]  So that's why they want to cancel that.
[00:41:54.371 --> 00:41:56.472]  Okay, where to go next?
[00:41:56.752 --> 00:42:01.854]  How about some of the COVID madness here?
[00:42:04.616 --> 00:42:05.456]  Thomas Massey
[00:42:06.954 --> 00:42:08.855]  I thought America might like to know this.
[00:42:09.015 --> 00:42:14.179]  Few congressmen or staff or guards are wearing masks in the hallways or offices, only on the floor for TV.
[00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:15.400]  It's all theatrics, folks.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.721]  Thomas Massey, a great American.
[00:42:17.461 --> 00:42:18.842]  He again says, we've had enough.
[00:42:18.882 --> 00:42:24.966]  We are refusing to wear our masks on the floor during this vote in spite of Pelosi's threats to take 500 from us every day.
[00:42:25.567 --> 00:42:30.410]  What a cunning woman she is.
[00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:34.073]  Nancy Pelosi is a cunning
[00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:36.852]  B-I-H, isn't she?
[00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:41.594]  And now she's fined!
[00:42:42.314 --> 00:42:44.294]  She has fined Brian Mast!
[00:42:44.874 --> 00:42:48.475]  Representative from Florida has been fined $500 by Nancy Pelosi!
[00:42:50.816 --> 00:42:54.157]  The cunning woman from San Francisco!
[00:42:56.878 --> 00:42:57.618]  Unbelievable!
[00:42:59.738 --> 00:43:01.779]  And then, this is even more pathetic!
[00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:06.728]  Marjorie Taylor Greene shares this story.
[00:43:08.508 --> 00:43:12.570]  Proud to join these patriots for a peaceful protest on the House floor against mask mandates.
[00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:15.391]  And there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Republicans.
[00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:15.611]  EIGHT!
[00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:26.441]  You only have eight people willing to protest against masks?
[00:43:27.002 --> 00:43:30.664]  You only have eight Republicans willing to stand with Marjorie Taylor Greene?
[00:43:31.264 --> 00:43:33.365]  The Republican Party is pathetic!
[00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:35.126]  What a joke!
[00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:48.680]  So hat tip to Madison Cawthorn and Brian Mast and Thomas Massey and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert and I can't recognize the other three right now off the top of my head but salute to them.
[00:43:49.441 --> 00:43:53.604]  Sorry the rest of your party is a pathetic cowardly joke.
[00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.529]  Disgusting.
[00:44:01.997 --> 00:44:04.258]  I will say, I think Mitch McConnell made a good move today.
[00:44:04.298 --> 00:44:04.838]  I forget what it was.
[00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:08.679]  I think he wants to ban vaccine passports or something.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:11.660]  I don't remember.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.021]  Mitch McConnell did do something nice today.
[00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:15.902]  But Mitch McConnell's not there protesting against the face muzzle.
[00:44:15.942 --> 00:44:16.122]  Nope.
[00:44:16.622 --> 00:44:17.502]  Only eight Republicans.
[00:44:17.522 --> 00:44:18.543]  We can only get eight to do that.
[00:44:18.643 --> 00:44:19.343]  Only eight could show up.
[00:44:19.643 --> 00:44:20.583]  Not a single Democrat.
[00:44:20.944 --> 00:44:23.404]  They're too busy trying to kill all the Jews!
[00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:24.685]  Yeah!
[00:44:25.825 --> 00:44:26.685]  That's a nice one.
[00:44:27.826 --> 00:44:30.687]  Democrats are too busy trying to kill all the Jews.
[00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.351]  Oh, that's what it was.
[00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:38.834]  Mitch McConnell opposed this commission to investigate January 6th.
[00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:40.014]  You know what?
[00:44:40.855 --> 00:44:41.876]  I'm praising him too early.
[00:44:41.896 --> 00:44:42.716]  He'll buckle on that.
[00:44:43.497 --> 00:44:44.097]  Mark my words.
[00:44:44.137 --> 00:44:45.918]  He'll buckle on that like he buckles on everything else.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.942]  The story is at the Gateway Pundit.
[00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:52.443]  Cowards!
[00:44:52.483 --> 00:44:52.883]  New board!
[00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:53.283]  New board!
[00:44:53.403 --> 00:44:57.726]  Epic Scottsdale Unified School District Board shouted out of the building over COVID restrictions.
[00:44:57.766 --> 00:45:00.408]  So this is like the fourth or fifth time that we've seen this.
[00:45:00.728 --> 00:45:01.869]  I'm sure it's happening other places.
[00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:03.070]  So America is rising up.
[00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:09.941]  Which is really angering the globalists because then, see now you've realized that you're under attack and you have a will to survive.
[00:45:09.981 --> 00:45:10.862]  That pisses them off.
[00:45:11.603 --> 00:45:13.846]  That hurts their exterminate all the humans agenda.
[00:45:13.866 --> 00:45:17.290]  Alright, we're going to be taking your phone calls after this short segment.
[00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.754]  Let me just get to some of this other news though before we do.
[00:45:21.997 --> 00:45:24.200]  Yeah, we saw this dynamic coming.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:25.862]  It was pretty obvious.
[00:45:25.942 --> 00:45:31.709]  Black Lives Matter declares solidarity with Hamas in Israel conflict.
[00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:32.790]  And of course we saw that.
[00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:35.474]  And so really this is the dichotomy of it.
[00:45:38.916 --> 00:45:55.886]  Just like Black Lives Matter or black people in America, Hamas or Palestinians, whatever you want to say, it's all just a political football that right now the left uses to try to win you over with emotion or sympathy points, playing the victims.
[00:45:57.116 --> 00:45:58.236]  So it's the same thing.
[00:45:58.777 --> 00:46:00.517]  Palestinians will always play the victims.
[00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.018]  Hamas will always play the victims.
[00:46:02.418 --> 00:46:07.879]  Mainstream media literally encamped with the Hamas terrorists, playing the victims.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:15.282]  I mean, you can't deny their thuggish behavior, going into people's homes, throwing rocks at people that have rifles.
[00:46:16.162 --> 00:46:16.822]  Not a good idea.
[00:46:16.902 --> 00:46:21.043]  I'm just saying, maybe you're in the right, maybe you're not, but you're throwing rocks at guys that have rifles.
[00:46:21.303 --> 00:46:22.544]  And they're not even firing back.
[00:46:23.544 --> 00:46:28.026]  Kind of like what, again, but that's the dichotomy of the cops and Black Lives Matter in the U.S.
[00:46:28.506 --> 00:46:37.731]  So Hamas terrorists and Palestinians attack Israel to force people and Israel defends people and throw rocks at them and they have guns and they never fire back.
[00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:38.692]  They just sit there and take it.
[00:46:38.952 --> 00:46:40.352]  And then the same thing happens in the U.S.
[00:46:40.372 --> 00:46:41.573]  Police get attacked all day long.
[00:46:41.593 --> 00:46:43.694]  They have guns, but they just sit there and take it.
[00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:49.137]  So this dynamic was surely inevitable.
[00:46:50.450 --> 00:47:02.591]  And but now there's really a fracture inside the Democrat Party and you had Rashida Tlaib excoriating Joe Biden for being a terrorist, I suppose is what she's saying, for helping Israel bomb the Gaza Strip.
[00:47:03.567 --> 00:47:04.647]  And bomb that building.
[00:47:05.128 --> 00:47:12.951]  By the way, it's hundreds of millions of dollars spent, or hundreds of millions of dollars blown up in the air over Israel and the Gaza Strip, so somebody's making out like a bandit.
[00:47:12.971 --> 00:47:13.631]  That's always nice.
[00:47:13.651 --> 00:47:14.271]  War's a racket.
[00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:21.794]  House Democrats just blocked bipartisan sanctions against those who provide financial support to Hamas, the terrorist group in Israel.
[00:47:22.754 --> 00:47:25.916]  Which, it's pretty much an international conclusion, Hamas is a terrorist group.
[00:47:26.316 --> 00:47:29.017]  So the Democrats want to fund a terrorist group.
[00:47:30.234 --> 00:47:38.477]  Again, the Democrats, at least some, the radical left Democrats, are now on the side of history of kill all Jews.
[00:47:39.158 --> 00:47:42.679]  So, this is like why you had one of the CNN contributors praising Hitler.
[00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:47.181]  I don't know why Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib and AOC just don't come out as Nazis.
[00:47:48.001 --> 00:47:51.682]  Because, I mean, you're told the number one thing about Nazis was kill all the Jews.
[00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:55.624]  Well, that's the side of history they're on, so they should come out as Nazis.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.662]  Of course, the irony is not, or is lost on them, it's not lost on us.
[00:48:01.883 --> 00:48:06.927]  As they point and call everybody Hitler and a Nazi, they're literally on the side of history of kill all Jews.
[00:48:07.287 --> 00:48:10.769]  Yeah, there is, is that a Stone Toss comic, I think?
[00:48:10.909 --> 00:48:18.494]  A Stone Toss comic of, you know, the radical left calling people an anti-Semite, but now they realize they're on the side of death to all Jews?
[00:48:20.496 --> 00:48:23.518]  I mean, you can't, but really it just shows how dumb these people are.
[00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:25.925]  And how they don't really stand for anything.
[00:48:26.026 --> 00:48:27.867]  And so they can be manipulated into anything.
[00:48:28.848 --> 00:48:29.288]  And everything.
[00:48:29.669 --> 00:48:30.209]  Shock, pull.
[00:48:30.249 --> 00:48:33.572]  Democrats blame Israel, not Hamas, terrorists for violence in the Middle East.
[00:48:33.592 --> 00:48:33.992]  So again.
[00:48:35.213 --> 00:48:37.095]  But hey, Biden okayed all the bombings.
[00:48:37.175 --> 00:48:39.137]  Biden said Israel has the right to defend itself.
[00:48:42.199 --> 00:48:46.543]  And AOC and the goon squad are pro-kill-all-the-Jews.
[00:48:46.703 --> 00:48:51.688]  So they're on the same side of history as Adolf, Hitler, and the Nazis.
[00:48:53.339 --> 00:49:00.360]  But don't worry, they're not going to stop pointing fingers everywhere and saying, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, as they're literally on the side of kill all the Jews.
[00:49:00.901 --> 00:49:01.981]  I mean, incredible!
[00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:05.501]  So, wow.
[00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:06.782]  But you know, I will just say this.
[00:49:07.062 --> 00:49:08.602]  Here's where I stand on this.
[00:49:10.202 --> 00:49:11.362]  I don't want to be involved.
[00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:14.083]  I think that most people in the audience don't want to be involved.
[00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:17.484]  Here's the problem with the pro-Israel crowd in the United States right now.
[00:49:19.044 --> 00:49:19.184]  See,
[00:49:20.149 --> 00:49:29.453]  Israel or Jews should be thanking the United States of America, kissing our boots every day, and asking us for the support and help.
[00:49:29.593 --> 00:49:36.416]  But no, what do you get from pro-Israel, from the pro-Israel lobby in the United States and all of their little minions?
[00:49:36.796 --> 00:49:37.616]  Support Israel!
[00:49:37.656 --> 00:49:38.376]  You have to!
[00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:39.577]  You must!
[00:49:40.865 --> 00:49:42.527]  And they demand you support Israel.
[00:49:43.408 --> 00:49:44.389]  No, you don't do that.
[00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.053]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:49.696]  You should be thanking us every day.
[00:49:50.077 --> 00:49:55.884]  You should be thanking the United States of America and Russia, quite frankly, every day that you haven't been wiped off the map.
[00:49:56.104 --> 00:49:57.046]  Which is a good thing!
[00:49:57.066 --> 00:49:57.126]  But...
[00:49:59.378 --> 00:50:06.304]  It's real cringe and it's a real turn-off when Jews and pro-Israel people demand America support them.
[00:50:06.404 --> 00:50:07.285]  That's not how this works.
[00:50:07.765 --> 00:50:11.268]  Don't forget to shop at InfoWarsStore.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:12.889]  Keep the Alex Jones Show on the air.
[00:50:12.929 --> 00:50:14.330]  We've built our own platforms.
[00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:20.315]  Band.Video, BandThis.TV, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:21.516]  All thanks to you.
[00:50:21.536 --> 00:50:22.017]  You built that.
[00:50:22.357 --> 00:50:26.961]  You built that when you shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so we thank you for that.
[00:50:28.263 --> 00:50:37.390]  And remember, coming up next Tuesday, the great debate, Middle East in Crisis, Nick Fuentes and Robert Barnes, moderated by myself, Alex Jones, and Harrison Smith.
[00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.190]  We're looking forward to that.
[00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.091]  We'll have the debates.
[00:50:39.151 --> 00:50:44.095]  We'll host the debates that nobody else will, because I guess they're too afraid, or I don't know what it is.
[00:50:44.795 --> 00:50:45.316]  But we're not.
[00:50:45.736 --> 00:50:50.179]  Now, as I promised, we have the phone lines loaded.
[00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:50.840]  The question.
[00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:54.693]  Is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine?
[00:50:55.554 --> 00:50:58.776]  And what actions are you going to take in response to that?
[00:50:58.856 --> 00:50:59.736]  Or what are you considering?
[00:51:00.016 --> 00:51:05.759]  The lines are lit up from a wide spectrum of industries of people calling in on this.
[00:51:05.779 --> 00:51:06.720]  So I'm looking forward to this.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:12.643]  We're going to do this for the rest of the hour, along with some other breaking news that I still have here on my desk.
[00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:14.804]  Let's start with Taylor.
[00:51:15.725 --> 00:51:17.546]  Taylor calling in from New Mexico.
[00:51:17.566 --> 00:51:21.489]  A maintenance worker turned down work for not being vaccinated.
[00:51:21.509 --> 00:51:22.870]  Taylor, tell us your story.
[00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:24.431]  Hey, Owen.
[00:51:24.991 --> 00:51:26.813]  Man, I'm glad to be on the show.
[00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:40.102]  I just want to say I got the InfoWars t-shirt and I'll tell you what, I've never been complimented on a t-shirt before, but I've always been more complimented on the t-shirt from InfoWars.
[00:51:40.142 --> 00:51:40.883]  Man, people love them.
[00:51:41.411 --> 00:51:42.952]  You know, that's such a great story.
[00:51:43.012 --> 00:51:46.075]  And I understand you put the Infowars on your chest, on your back.
[00:51:46.595 --> 00:51:58.064]  You know, there's a risk factor that some radical leftist will harass you, but the odds are actually more likely that you're going to get a handshake, you're going to get a pat on the back, and you're going to get a smile and a wink and a nod.
[00:51:58.784 --> 00:51:59.785]  Yep, exactly.
[00:51:59.805 --> 00:52:03.828]  So, yeah, I just want to touch base on the vaccination thing.
[00:52:04.568 --> 00:52:05.749]  I do maintenance work.
[00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:06.550]  I'm self-employed.
[00:52:07.028 --> 00:52:16.172]  But here lately I've been having people, like homeowners and people that are hiring me, they're asking me if I'm vaccinated before showing up on the job.
[00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:21.255]  And at first I told them no, and immediately, you know, they'll hang up.
[00:52:21.595 --> 00:52:27.458]  And then the second time I said, well, you know, the HIPAA law, you know, it's confidentiality.
[00:52:27.898 --> 00:52:29.979]  And then they'll hang up too.
[00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:32.520]  So I've lost work over it.
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.201]  And it's,
[00:52:35.057 --> 00:52:42.861]  It's pretty, uh, you know, it's starting to, you know, I'm starting to see the effects now, um, you know, firsthand and, uh, it's pretty scary.
[00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:55.627]  And also, um, you know, my church, um, you know, we're, we're pretty conservative, you know, I would say about 95% are, you know, Republicans and conservatives, but they're still getting the vaccine.
[00:52:55.988 --> 00:53:02.411]  And it's, it's scary, you know, cause you look at these people that I've looked up to all these years, you know, strong Christian, you know,
[00:53:02.953 --> 00:53:07.161]  Um, faith and just real wise people, you know, getting the vaccine shots and.
[00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:12.154]  I just I don't get it, you know, so I don't understand it at all.
[00:53:12.334 --> 00:53:17.598]  Well, and this is really going to be, I think, the only test to say, you know, what's happening with vaccine shedding.
[00:53:17.638 --> 00:53:18.698]  But it'll be interesting to see.
[00:53:18.718 --> 00:53:25.383]  I mean, if the entire crew is is vaccinated, but like I don't think anybody at Infowars is going to get the vaccine.
[00:53:25.423 --> 00:53:26.924]  So we're not around vaccinated people.
[00:53:27.344 --> 00:53:32.247]  If I go out to, you know, a grocery store or the gym or a bar or something, I don't know who's vaccinated and who's not.
[00:53:32.307 --> 00:53:35.950]  But in your place of employment, you can kind of know, hey, I'm the only unvaccinated one.
[00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:37.391]  Oh, I'm having different side effects.
[00:53:37.971 --> 00:53:39.452]  So I think it'll be interesting to see.
[00:53:40.392 --> 00:53:42.112]  So this is the new segregation though.
[00:53:42.172 --> 00:53:48.214]  This is the new discrimination brought to you by big pharmaceutical medical tyranny that owns the media.
[00:53:48.634 --> 00:53:53.936]  And so now you can't get a job freelancing and maintenance from a lot of people because you're vaccinated.
[00:53:53.976 --> 00:53:55.076]  So thanks to the media.
[00:53:55.676 --> 00:53:58.377]  Thanks to the medical tyranny for putting you in this position, Taylor.
[00:53:58.417 --> 00:54:02.538]  Just real quick on the whole Israel thing.
[00:54:02.578 --> 00:54:05.019]  You know, I support America.
[00:54:05.478 --> 00:54:08.339]  But I don't support the people that are in power right now.
[00:54:08.419 --> 00:54:09.400]  I think they're very corrupt.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.541]  And, you know, I support Israel, but I don't support the people that are in power right now.
[00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:14.842]  I think they're very corrupt.
[00:54:15.342 --> 00:54:23.626]  So I'm really happy that y'all are having this debate, you know, coming up next Tuesday, because people do need to have this debate.
[00:54:23.926 --> 00:54:28.968]  And, you know, killing innocent people isn't, you know, you shouldn't be supportive of any of that.
[00:54:30.149 --> 00:54:41.593]  Um, it's pretty scary, uh, to see a lot of, even, even Christians, you know, they kind of, they're playing on the Christian part, you know, like, oh, we're supposed to support Israel, which we are, but this is anything.
[00:54:41.633 --> 00:54:45.574]  I mean, that's like saying worship, but it's like, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:54:45.634 --> 00:54:47.115]  Like we might as well be Israel.
[00:54:47.135 --> 00:54:48.896]  It might as well be USA.
[00:54:49.796 --> 00:54:49.976]  Yeah.
[00:54:50.176 --> 00:54:54.057]  And I have, I have people in my church that are supporting this, this bombing thing.
[00:54:54.177 --> 00:54:55.898]  And, you know, because of, you know, biblical,
[00:54:56.695 --> 00:55:01.703]  Biblical, there always will be terrorists and war in the Middle East.
[00:55:01.783 --> 00:55:03.866]  It says it, you know, there'll always be that.
[00:55:04.006 --> 00:55:04.267]  Right.
[00:55:04.527 --> 00:55:07.312]  But people are supporting it in my church, and I'm like,
[00:55:08.208 --> 00:55:09.629]  I don't get it, you know.
[00:55:09.929 --> 00:55:11.490]  I don't have a good feeling about this at all.
[00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.650]  Well, it's a big topic.
[00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:15.492]  It has been for decades, if not thousands of years.
[00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.293]  And we thank you for your call, Taylor.
[00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:19.334]  But I want to get back on to the subject at hand.
[00:55:20.034 --> 00:55:22.535]  But thank you for your call and for shopping at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:22.555 --> 00:55:23.335]  We appreciate that.
[00:55:23.896 --> 00:55:25.837]  Let's go to, let's see here.
[00:55:26.137 --> 00:55:28.998]  Rick in Tennessee got fired for not wearing a mask.
[00:55:29.198 --> 00:55:31.239]  New job requiring a vaccine.
[00:55:31.459 --> 00:55:32.700]  Rick, what's your story?
[00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:34.251]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:34.592 --> 00:55:37.096]  Well, it's a little bit wrong on the description there.
[00:55:37.116 --> 00:55:37.396]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:38.939]  Maybe I misunderstood when I talked to you.
[00:55:38.959 --> 00:55:39.420]  That's okay.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:39.780]  You know what?
[00:55:39.981 --> 00:55:44.188]  I normally don't read off of the color board like that because that tends to happen in the screening process.
[00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:45.930]  So I'll probably quit doing that.
[00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:46.552]  But yeah, go ahead.
[00:55:47.239 --> 00:55:47.639]  That's okay.
[00:55:47.739 --> 00:55:48.799]  It's real close.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.020]  I worked in Pigeon Forge.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.080]  I was a maintenance supervisor for one of the resorts here.
[00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:54.521]  I was on the job for well over two weeks.
[00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:58.122]  Been laid off for the first round of COVID forever, and I finally got this job.
[00:55:58.182 --> 00:56:00.523]  And on the job for two weeks, nobody's wearing their mask.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:03.243]  Everybody's just half on, half off.
[00:56:03.283 --> 00:56:03.844]  It's hanging off.
[00:56:03.864 --> 00:56:04.564]  They're not even wearing it.
[00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:07.205]  All of a sudden, my boss just says, you've got to wear your mask.
[00:56:07.245 --> 00:56:07.905]  I said, I can't do it.
[00:56:07.925 --> 00:56:08.705]  I have medical reasons.
[00:56:09.205 --> 00:56:09.305]  Wow.
[00:56:09.325 --> 00:56:09.425]  Yeah.
[00:56:38.473 --> 00:56:39.014]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:59.430]  It's tough trying to find a place that doesn't require you to wear a mask, but it's getting easier.
[00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:00.932]  So a lot of these people are getting fed up with it.
[00:57:00.992 --> 00:57:04.076]  You think this would be such an easier battle to win?
[00:57:04.577 --> 00:57:06.239]  Not wearing a face muzzle?
[00:57:06.339 --> 00:57:08.282]  Not breathing in your own carbon dioxide?
[00:57:08.322 --> 00:57:08.922]  Being free?
[00:57:08.942 --> 00:57:11.386]  It's amazing that we even have to, like, fight this battle!
[00:57:12.219 --> 00:57:25.335]  Well, here, I'm standing outside right by my chickens here, and I got chicken wire around my fence, and what I want to do is just put a thing on TV that goes, okay, this fence represents your mask, and this little bitty tiny pebble that I can throw right through there is the coronavirus.
[00:57:25.455 --> 00:57:29.880]  Oh yeah, there's these new videos and stuff out where they show, like, sheetrock.
[00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:43.886]  And Sheetrock has, I think, like 0.25 microns or whatever, and they put the medical mask that they tell you to wear for COVID over it, and then they show people's face after busting up Sheetrock, and the whole face is covered in Sheetrock, meaning that the Sheetrock dust gets through the mask.
[00:57:44.367 --> 00:57:50.029]  And the COVID particles are 0.001 microns or whatever, compared to the 0.25 of Sheetrock.
[00:57:50.049 --> 00:57:51.389]  So, I mean, it's just a complete joke.
[00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:53.770]  Rick, thank you so much for the call.
[00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:56.151]  Let's go to Philip in Indiana.
[00:57:57.152 --> 00:58:00.013]  Philip, is your employer requiring you to take a vaccine?
[00:58:01.534 --> 00:58:02.555]  No, it isn't.
[00:58:02.995 --> 00:58:15.163]  The thing of an employer requiring me to take a vaccine is that yesterday, the state of Indiana, and where I was living, did a silver alert for free vaccines.
[00:58:17.685 --> 00:58:19.406]  They put it over the EAS system.
[00:58:20.747 --> 00:58:24.670]  Came across as though it was a little kid lost or an elderly person lost.
[00:58:28.446 --> 00:58:31.948]  So they're putting out emergency notifications for free vaccines.
[00:58:32.928 --> 00:58:33.148]  Right.
[00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:38.071]  And are they requiring it?
[00:58:38.091 --> 00:58:39.793]  I mean, what's so, so, so, okay.
[00:58:39.813 --> 00:58:48.638]  I mean, it's the thing of that it's that tactic of using something that is supposed to alert us to some danger or some serious incident.
[00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:51.460]  But, but so yeah, yeah.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.882]  So taking the emergency alert system and turning it into a big pharmaceutical marketing firm.
[00:59:01.283 --> 00:59:02.084]  Anything else, Philip?
[00:59:04.545 --> 00:59:05.886]  Well, I can give you a joke.
[00:59:06.987 --> 00:59:07.707]  Let's have a joke.
[00:59:07.727 --> 00:59:08.748]  We've got 30 seconds left.
[00:59:08.768 --> 00:59:09.128]  Go ahead.
[00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.409]  Alright.
[00:59:10.449 --> 00:59:15.833]  You had Ilhan Omar and Xi Jinping, and they had a running bet.
[00:59:17.694 --> 00:59:30.363]  And the running bet was $10 million that Xi Jinping bet Ilhan Omar that he could get 60% of the American male population to wear a burqa.
[00:59:34.107 --> 00:59:35.268]  Fortunately, he won the bet.
[00:59:36.629 --> 00:59:39.392]  So Ilhan had to call all the slave labor over there.
[00:59:40.854 --> 00:59:43.396]  Yeah, now they're getting women to put on the burka full-time.
[00:59:43.576 --> 00:59:44.057]  They love it.
[00:59:44.597 --> 00:59:45.958]  Next, they'll be pushing gaze-off buildings.
[00:59:46.499 --> 00:59:54.367]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the great debate on the Middle Eastern crisis with Bob Barnes and Nick Fuentes.
[00:59:56.516 --> 00:59:59.981]  Nick Fuentes challenged Dave Rubin to a debate on the issue and Dave Rubin blocked him.
[01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:03.326]  That's how confident he is on his stance, I'm sure.
[01:00:04.227 --> 01:00:06.711]  So Bob Barnes is going to have that debate.
[01:00:08.123 --> 01:00:13.169]  And we're going to host it at GreatDebate.News next Tuesday, 6 p.m.
[01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:15.131]  Central, following the War Room.
[01:00:15.151 --> 01:00:18.334]  It'll be moderated by Alex Jones, myself, and Harrison Smith.
[01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:26.503]  So once again, the Intrepid InfoWars going where no other news team, no other broadcast transmission station will go.
[01:00:27.444 --> 01:00:30.025]  And it's only possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:00:30.646 --> 01:00:39.570]  We'd like this to happen all the time, but most people are too scared to either speak their mind, too scared to debate with anybody, or too scared to go on InfoWars.
[01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:45.433]  So that's the trifecta of fear, of cowardice, that we witness here in the media.
[01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:47.868]  We're going back to the phone lines now.
[01:00:47.888 --> 01:00:52.550]  We're asking people, is your employer forcing you to take a vaccine?
[01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:53.930]  We've had a couple examples so far.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:01:01.534]  We go back to the phone lines now, and we've got Eric in New Hampshire.
[01:01:01.714 --> 01:01:03.275]  You are on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:03.915]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:05.536]  Hey, Owen.
[01:01:05.556 --> 01:01:06.536]  It's good to talk to you, brother.
[01:01:07.037 --> 01:01:07.537]  Thanks for calling.
[01:01:09.118 --> 01:01:14.940]  So my story is my son, who's 21 years old, works in a warehouse facility.
[01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:16.321]  They got a
[01:01:17.043 --> 01:01:17.664]  We're good to go.
[01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:41.313]  Okay.
[01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:17.403]  And do what's right for the freedom of America and stand up for everybody, even the people you don't necessarily agree with.
[01:02:23.885 --> 01:02:29.907]  Don't think that you have to be bullied by these vaccine, pro-vaccine, New World Order, stooge bullies.
[01:02:30.627 --> 01:02:31.487]  Stand up for yourself.
[01:02:31.787 --> 01:02:35.168]  And there's an example of victory for your sons right there.
[01:02:35.248 --> 01:02:36.749]  Eric, thank you so much for the call.
[01:02:37.369 --> 01:02:40.690]  Let's go to Bob in New York.
[01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:42.991]  Bob, what's your story?
[01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:45.311]  Owen, listen to me.
[01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:46.072]  I love you.
[01:02:46.092 --> 01:02:49.813]  But listen, I am a personal trainer in New York.
[01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:56.232]  So you can guess how my business has gone in 2020 with the shutdown.
[01:02:56.252 --> 01:02:58.073]  I bet it has been fun.
[01:02:59.034 --> 01:02:59.434]  Yeah.
[01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:00.275]  Really cool, man.
[01:03:00.315 --> 01:03:07.080]  You know, I like to, actually I've been blessed, but COVID was good for me personally, but it killed.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:14.145]  I mean, I can't even talk about how many businesses, but the fitness industry of course went down the, uh, the crap hole.
[01:03:14.185 --> 01:03:16.126]  So people took it upon themselves, go out, whatever.
[01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:19.729]  Um, but I, I have, luckily I have, uh,
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.261]  A good stable of people that love me.
[01:03:22.301 --> 01:03:22.741]  I love them.
[01:03:22.821 --> 01:03:24.022]  I think I can't be replaced.
[01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:26.523]  So they took me into their homes after a certain period of time.
[01:03:27.743 --> 01:03:28.243]  But they're old.
[01:03:28.483 --> 01:03:37.047]  Okay, so there are some buildings where, because no one's in a single family home, this is all apartment buildings we're talking about.
[01:03:37.107 --> 01:03:42.189]  So I have to go and deal with the co-op to use the gym in the basement, let's say.
[01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.891]  You know, gyms are not anything to write home about.
[01:03:44.911 --> 01:03:46.391]  Little tiny formal closets.
[01:03:47.512 --> 01:03:49.573]  But it did its job for years and years.
[01:03:50.811 --> 01:03:59.438]  And now we're getting to the point where I'm, for instance, one client I'm with, his wife is Rachel Maddow, 100%, and he's kind of cool.
[01:03:59.478 --> 01:04:03.722]  You know, he got the Vax, but he lets me, you know, handle him.
[01:04:03.762 --> 01:04:06.464]  I'm literally, we're in close range, obviously, right?
[01:04:06.484 --> 01:04:09.066]  I'm stretching, touching his feet, touching his shoulders, everything.
[01:04:10.015 --> 01:04:18.583]  Um, so yeah, of course my business went right down, but the co-ops are gonna probably force me to take a vax to get back into their buildings, and that's where I step off.
[01:04:18.663 --> 01:04:19.284]  I'm already off.
[01:04:19.344 --> 01:04:21.606]  I already left this train, you know, I'm just...
[01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:25.058]  Sort of working with who I can, but they're going to try to force me.
[01:04:25.418 --> 01:04:26.338]  I've already lost business.
[01:04:26.358 --> 01:04:29.300]  Well, is that going to become a story just to live?
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:35.043]  I mean, I don't know what the percentage of people that live in New York City that live in apartments are, but I would imagine it's the large majority.
[01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:42.147]  I mean, are they going to force you if you're in an apartment building to get a vaccine?
[01:04:42.207 --> 01:04:43.448]  I mean, can they even do that?
[01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:44.188]  That's illegal if they try that.
[01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:47.471]  Well, no kidding.
[01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:55.293]  You know, if I have to sit before the board and actually put a YouTube video out with the meeting and see how ridiculous they are, I'll do that.
[01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:56.633]  But pretty much, I'm just going to walk in there.
[01:04:56.653 --> 01:04:57.793]  It's just not worth it.
[01:04:58.213 --> 01:05:03.134]  For them to ask anybody to do something like that, they're brazen enough that they, yes, they will.
[01:05:03.234 --> 01:05:04.575]  Yes, they're going to encourage us.
[01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:06.015]  If you want to work, blah, blah, blah.
[01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:06.835]  Well, guess what?
[01:05:07.175 --> 01:05:08.675]  I work for myself, so I don't work for you.
[01:05:08.715 --> 01:05:09.876]  I have to say goodbye to my client.
[01:05:09.896 --> 01:05:11.336]  And you know, here's what's going to have to happen.
[01:05:11.376 --> 01:05:15.397]  Not only are people going to have to stand up for themselves, but you're going to have to make measured responses to this.
[01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:15.997]  And I mean, look,
[01:05:17.398 --> 01:05:18.179]  If you can handle it.
[01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:22.322]  You know, one approach is, Hey, have you been vaccinated?
[01:05:22.383 --> 01:05:22.643]  No.
[01:05:22.743 --> 01:05:26.706]  Oh, you need to take the vaccine to come in and say, okay, tell me what, what's in that vaccine.
[01:05:26.786 --> 01:05:27.908]  Can you tell me the ingredients?
[01:05:27.948 --> 01:05:28.848]  Can you tell me the side effects?
[01:05:28.888 --> 01:05:31.291]  And of course they'll have a blank look on their face and they won't be able to stop.
[01:05:31.551 --> 01:05:34.774]  And he says, Oh, so you want to force me to put something in my body.
[01:05:34.794 --> 01:05:36.936]  You're asking me, you're requesting, you're demanding.
[01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.418]  I put something in my body and you don't even know what's in it.
[01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:40.159]  Huh?
[01:05:40.639 --> 01:05:41.900]  Boy, that doesn't seem right.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:42.401]  Does it?
[01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:49.245]  And so, you know, maybe you can have a little intellectual victory right then and there with logic and freedom as your backdrop.
[01:05:49.306 --> 01:05:50.907]  But, Bob, thank you so much for the call.
[01:05:51.207 --> 01:05:53.048]  Let's go to John in California.
[01:05:53.548 --> 01:05:54.869]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:55.570]  John, go ahead.
[01:05:56.831 --> 01:05:57.391]  Hi, Owen.
[01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.052]  Good to talk to you.
[01:05:59.072 --> 01:06:01.854]  It's my first time calling.
[01:06:01.894 --> 01:06:05.897]  I'm calling basically about my mom.
[01:06:07.378 --> 01:06:07.778]  Are you there?
[01:06:08.179 --> 01:06:08.599]  Can you hear me?
[01:06:08.879 --> 01:06:09.540]  Yep, you're on air.
[01:06:10.538 --> 01:06:11.359]  Alright, cool.
[01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:13.961]  Just calling about, I'm out in California.
[01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:17.243]  My mom was out here.
[01:06:17.323 --> 01:06:24.249]  She finally made it out of California to a state that's not requiring masks right now.
[01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:28.712]  She's working for a big box chain store.
[01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:36.198]  I guess you could say it starts with a C. And they're requiring a vaccine.
[01:06:37.873 --> 01:06:44.915]  In order for her to not wear a mask, she has to show proof that she has the vaccine.
[01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:48.836]  Her and others don't want to wear them.
[01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:50.716]  They're tired of wearing them.
[01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:53.957]  They're tired of forcing employees to wear them and everything.
[01:06:54.817 --> 01:06:59.498]  There's a little bit of division in the company.
[01:06:59.618 --> 01:07:01.379]  Let's be perfectly clear about this.
[01:07:04.443 --> 01:07:07.824]  I mean, it's hard to say it's all, but I mean, for the most part, this is all Democrats, folks.
[01:07:07.864 --> 01:07:10.265]  This is all liberal Democrats forcing you to do this.
[01:07:10.665 --> 01:07:20.609]  That's why states like California and New York and Democrat governors are saying, nope, even though the CDC says it's okay to take the mask off, we're going to continue to mandate masks, and Republican states are lifting the masks.
[01:07:20.909 --> 01:07:26.911]  So these are liberal progressive Democrats forcing you into this medical tyranny, and it's just incredible.
[01:07:26.931 --> 01:07:30.492]  I mean, but see, this just shows you how they trapped us, folks.
[01:07:31.012 --> 01:07:33.013]  This really shows you how they trapped us, and
[01:07:34.397 --> 01:07:39.858]  I mean, part of it is just there's nothing you can do, but people need money.
[01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:42.178]  Most people live paycheck to paycheck.
[01:07:42.198 --> 01:07:48.359]  They can't afford to take time off work or re-evaluate their financial situation, so they're enslaved.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:08:00.101]  It's like indentured servitude through fiat, and they can't take time off work, so it's like now, I mean, I just can't believe, this is the reality of the situation.
[01:08:01.602 --> 01:08:02.882]  And so, this is like,
[01:08:03.783 --> 01:08:05.444]  This is what it feels like to be a slave.
[01:08:06.985 --> 01:08:11.968]  Forced to wear the mask, forced to take the vaccine, feeling like you have no out, feeling like you have no choice.
[01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:14.770]  This is how they've trapped us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:23.636]  So you have the fake vice president, most unpopular vice president, ineffective vice president in American history.
[01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:30.502]  Uh, Kamala, or how did Montel Willis tell people to say it when she was flandering around with him?
[01:08:30.522 --> 01:08:30.862]  Remember that?
[01:08:31.102 --> 01:08:37.225]  Was that before or after she was in the office scrubbing the floors with her knees of Mayor Willie Brown?
[01:08:37.925 --> 01:08:46.470]  Anyway, she's promoting the not FDA approved experimental COVID vaccine on Twitter.
[01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.391]  And you know, I love seeing the comments.
[01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:53.102]  From people who are logically just like, hey, you know, please don't say this.
[01:08:53.182 --> 01:08:58.723]  I support you, but please don't say it like this is insensitive and I don't want to take the vaccine or I have this reason not to take vaccine.
[01:08:58.943 --> 01:08:59.983]  And then they just get attacked.
[01:09:00.043 --> 01:09:01.063]  And it's always the radical left.
[01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:04.083]  Like you're going to die if you don't get the vaccine and you deserve it.
[01:09:04.423 --> 01:09:05.684]  You're going to kill my grandma.
[01:09:05.964 --> 01:09:07.064]  She doesn't deserve it, though.
[01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:10.244]  And it's just like all of this craziness, like the vaccine works.
[01:09:10.304 --> 01:09:11.225]  It's been proven to work.
[01:09:11.245 --> 01:09:13.625]  There are no there are no side effects.
[01:09:13.665 --> 01:09:15.345]  And you're just watching all of this happen.
[01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:16.245]  And it's just.
[01:09:17.646 --> 01:09:18.506]  And so the.
[01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:22.098]  Look, I've got an entire folder here.
[01:09:22.599 --> 01:09:25.922]  This is just, it was put together this morning by one of the crew members.
[01:09:25.942 --> 01:09:28.224]  I don't know if you can see how thick that is.
[01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:31.187]  I mean, I can give you a little, if you're a radio listener here, I'll drop it on the desk.
[01:09:32.827 --> 01:09:33.047]  All right.
[01:09:33.507 --> 01:09:37.568]  And so that's a file, a manila folder here that I can't even close.
[01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:40.009]  And so he could have kept going and researching.
[01:09:40.049 --> 01:09:46.091]  I said, just print me as many articles as you can find on vaccine side effects and deaths until you can't close the folder anymore.
[01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:47.751]  And so he did that and that's where it is.
[01:09:47.771 --> 01:09:53.413]  So, I mean, here's the book of COVID deaths and side effects.
[01:09:53.453 --> 01:09:56.654]  Here's the book that was printed out for me before the show.
[01:09:56.694 --> 01:09:58.435]  It's not even the entire book either, but you know.
[01:10:00.955 --> 01:10:01.596]  Pretty big, isn't it?
[01:10:01.616 --> 01:10:02.036]  Pretty heavy?
[01:10:02.176 --> 01:10:02.316]  Yeah.
[01:10:03.655 --> 01:10:06.177]  And you'll have these people saying, there are no side effects.
[01:10:06.697 --> 01:10:08.338]  Nobody's dying from the vaccine.
[01:10:08.418 --> 01:10:10.219]  Safe and effective.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.143]  And now we even know that one of the ingredients in the vaccine is known to be deadly.
[01:10:15.683 --> 01:10:17.064]  Known to be deadly.
[01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:24.969]  And so I'm sitting here thinking, it's almost like a magician with a magic trick, except it's not actually a magic trick.
[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:27.111]  Like just doing a backflip or something.
[01:10:28.972 --> 01:10:33.295]  And I mean, part of me feels bad because it's like,
[01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:38.034]  You're going to be, you're going to look like an idiot.
[01:10:41.056 --> 01:10:47.742]  It's like, we're going to be proven right on this again, but then I realize we've already been proven right on it.
[01:10:47.922 --> 01:10:49.243]  I don't even have to sit here and wait.
[01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:52.006]  We've already been proven right and these people are like in
[01:10:53.902 --> 01:11:03.754]  The cave, in Plato's cave, chained, forced to stare one direction at the wall, and all they can see is the shadows being cast on the wall.
[01:11:04.174 --> 01:11:04.995]  That's all they can see.
[01:11:05.973 --> 01:11:09.117]  So the COVID vaccine deaths are already here.
[01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:11.460]  The COVID side effects are already here.
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.561]  It's in mass.
[01:11:12.782 --> 01:11:14.444]  We've already been totally proven right.
[01:11:14.744 --> 01:11:16.787]  It's not even that we need to wait a year.
[01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:18.789]  We're already completely right on this.
[01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:22.454]  But these brainwashed and sadly, I mean, it's just true.
[01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:23.716]  I'm not politically divisive.
[01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:24.997]  Really, I'm a centrist.
[01:11:25.037 --> 01:11:25.557]  I'm a realist.
[01:11:25.777 --> 01:11:39.985]  But the truth is, the political left in this country is mentally retarded, and they're sitting here, staring at the wall on Plato's Cave, saying there's no death from the COVID shots, there's no side effects from the COVID shots, everybody has to take the shot to be a part of their cult.
[01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:46.823]  And it's sick, it's disgusting, and I know we're going to be proven right on this again, but they'll never learn.
[01:11:47.123 --> 01:11:48.984]  They'll never admit they've been duped.
[01:11:49.224 --> 01:11:57.650]  They'll never admit they've been forced to stare at the wall in the cave and see the shadows being cast upon it for them to see.
[01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:03.394]  So, yeah, the COVID vaccine deaths are already here.
[01:12:03.434 --> 01:12:04.415]  The side effects are already here.
[01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:05.695]  They'll never see it.
[01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.897]  They're chained up and they're only staring at the wall.
[01:12:08.217 --> 01:12:10.439]  So the mainstream media won't tell them any of this.
[01:12:11.747 --> 01:12:16.932]  And one part of me is heartbroken because of it, the other part of me says you're going to get what you deserve.
[01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:23.319]  But that's like, it's dirty to feel that way because that's the Bill Gates mentality.
[01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:28.104]  That's the elite, globalist, Illuminati mentality.
[01:12:28.484 --> 01:12:30.927]  You're too stupid, you deserve to die!
[01:12:33.309 --> 01:12:34.831]  I'm not the one that feels that way.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.201]  But just know that that's what's going on here.
[01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:40.343]  So, we go back to the phone lines.
[01:12:40.363 --> 01:12:43.905]  We're asking people, is your employer forcing you to take the vaccine?
[01:12:43.945 --> 01:12:45.106]  We've heard stories.
[01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:46.667]  This is definitely happening.
[01:12:46.687 --> 01:12:47.548]  This is the new trend.
[01:12:47.568 --> 01:12:53.632]  We're going to have to see what happens, I think, in the upcoming months about how we're going to deal with this.
[01:12:54.212 --> 01:12:56.534]  Are there going to be new economies that emerge because of this?
[01:12:56.594 --> 01:12:58.615]  Just totally unvaccinated economies?
[01:12:59.155 --> 01:13:01.557]  Because the establishment wants only vaccinated economies.
[01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.959]  That's the whole point, is you can't operate
[01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:11.364]  In the world, anywhere, except in their infrastructure, which they own everything, and you'll be forced to take a vaccine.
[01:13:12.966 --> 01:13:13.446]  Incredible.
[01:13:13.486 --> 01:13:15.788]  So yeah, they shut down all the small businesses.
[01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:23.554]  In the COVID shutdowns, in the fake pandemic, businesses, economic shutdown, they shut out all the small businesses.
[01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:27.037]  So now only the major corporations that own everything
[01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:31.347]  Are still alive, and now they're all going to force you to take a vaccine.
[01:13:31.588 --> 01:13:43.133]  And all the small mom-and-pop shops that were independently owned, and small businesses that were independently owned, that aren't part of the big corporate globalist Borg, that wouldn't have made you take a vaccine and wear a mask, now they're all gone!
[01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:49.536]  And all you have left is the corporate Borg cult globalists, who will force you to take a vaccine and wear a mask.
[01:13:50.637 --> 01:13:55.299]  And then the left, the liberal anti-fascist left,
[01:13:56.294 --> 01:14:00.577]  Can't even look in the mirror and realize what they've done.
[01:14:00.898 --> 01:14:10.305]  They can't even put two and two together and realize what they've done because their vision and their mind and their soul and their heart is so clouded and filled with hate.
[01:14:10.786 --> 01:14:11.666]  Filled with hate!
[01:14:12.587 --> 01:14:14.889]  Injected into them by the mainstream media.
[01:14:14.989 --> 01:14:17.091]  Injected into them by Barack Obama.
[01:14:17.371 --> 01:14:19.453]  Injected into them by our politicians.
[01:14:21.574 --> 01:14:23.336]  Oh boy, it is really sad.
[01:14:24.777 --> 01:14:25.838]  It is really evil, isn't it?
[01:14:27.728 --> 01:14:29.809]  So we go back out to the phone lines on this now.
[01:14:30.989 --> 01:14:33.070]  Greg called in from Ohio.
[01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:34.311]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:34.331 --> 01:14:34.951]  Greg, go ahead.
[01:14:36.252 --> 01:14:36.732]  Hey, Owen.
[01:14:37.712 --> 01:14:42.755]  Alex and Ron Paul woke me up in 2006, and I just want to thank you guys for everything that you guys do.
[01:14:43.735 --> 01:14:50.338]  I'm a touring entertainment technician, and a week ago, my employer called me to go work on a AAA concert tour.
[01:14:51.347 --> 01:15:00.392]  Um, after I accepted, they told me that I needed to send proof of vaccination, and I told them I'm not willing to take the gene therapy, and they took the offer off the table.
[01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:14.919]  Uh, the company itself does not require vaccination, but I received another phone call about five minutes later from the owner, and, uh, tour suppliers are requiring vaccination for all contracts and all employees of a tour.
[01:15:14.939 --> 01:15:19.581]  Uh, they're employing COVID officers and requiring multiple COVID tests per day.
[01:15:20.427 --> 01:15:28.532]  And they have to have extra personnel to fill in for people that are sent home from positive tests.
[01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:47.603]  And you know, here's what's probably going to have to happen in the next year or two is, and I get it folks, look, I love ball games and I love concerts and all of this stuff, but any institution that is forcing people to take vaccines or employers to take vaccines, we're going to have to just completely boycott.
[01:15:48.183 --> 01:15:57.065]  And so this is going to be a struggle, but it's going to pale in comparison to if we accept this forced medical tyranny injection.
[01:15:57.565 --> 01:16:08.947]  And so, yeah, you'll have to start going to local concerts and, you know, doing small events or stuff like that, or, you know, just going to your kid's ballgame instead of the big one, because that seems like a big sacrifice.
[01:16:08.987 --> 01:16:17.248]  No, that's a small sacrifice we're going to have to make, I think, in the interim here while they're trying to force this vaccine to avoid going under complete medical tyranny.
[01:16:18.695 --> 01:16:20.476]  That's exactly the point I wanted to make as well.
[01:16:20.556 --> 01:16:22.017]  So, thank you guys again.
[01:16:22.037 --> 01:16:23.838]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[01:16:24.499 --> 01:16:26.980]  Let's go to DC calling in from North Carolina.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.021]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:28.421]  Go ahead.
[01:16:29.762 --> 01:16:30.703]  Hey Owen, DC here.
[01:16:31.303 --> 01:16:31.563]  Howdy.
[01:16:32.644 --> 01:16:33.044]  Hey buddy.
[01:16:34.025 --> 01:16:37.367]  Okay, got some things to inform you on.
[01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:47.013]  So, my wife's boss is now bribing the employees with $200 to go get the vaccine.
[01:16:48.848 --> 01:16:52.550]  You know, that's, I mean, is this a big business?
[01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:57.172]  I mean, you don't have to give too much information, but that's a lot of money to be offering people as a vaccine incentive.
[01:16:57.192 --> 01:17:00.174]  It is, but you know what?
[01:17:00.834 --> 01:17:10.679]  We've come with a counter offer of $20,000 for him to sign for any injury from the vaccine, damages, or the doctor bills.
[01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:14.130]  Yeah, that's a good bait-and-switch.
[01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:18.353]  Hey, keep your $200, just sign this liability form.
[01:17:18.413 --> 01:17:20.574]  Yeah, how many of them will back out immediately?
[01:17:20.694 --> 01:17:21.374]  Exactly.
[01:17:21.394 --> 01:17:22.795]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:23.475 --> 01:17:27.418]  So, we've got, you know, it's the simple rule.
[01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:32.380]  Everyone in the office, unless you haven't been vaccinated, you have to wear a mask.
[01:17:32.621 --> 01:17:34.622]  So, that's the simple rule on that.
[01:17:36.604 --> 01:17:40.789]  But with no other outrageous rules or anything.
[01:17:55.063 --> 01:18:06.298]  Ladies and gentlemen, quickly, the Biden Department of Justice is throwing out all cases, most recently the Carter Page illegal FISA warrant spy case.
[01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:10.904]  The Department of Justice, the Biden Department of Justice is throwing all these cases out, which just
[01:18:11.385 --> 01:18:23.989]  Have Barack Obama and his administration with James Comey and Clapper and Brennan dead to rights for illegally spying, fising illegal FISA warrant requests, using known bad intelligence to do it.
[01:18:24.049 --> 01:18:25.790]  I mean, they're all caught dead to rights with everything.
[01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.951]  And the Biden Department of Justice is throwing all these cases out right now.
[01:18:28.991 --> 01:18:30.231]  The Carter Page one is the latest.
[01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:34.753]  So they're covering up their crimes, what they do best over there at the Department of Justice.
[01:18:34.773 --> 01:18:38.474]  And we can thank Bob Barr for allowing that to happen as well.
[01:18:38.514 --> 01:18:38.914]  Thanks a lot.
[01:18:38.954 --> 01:18:40.195]  Thanks for stabbing us in the back, Barr.
[01:18:42.445 --> 01:18:50.233]  We are still taking phone calls before we're going to be joined by Stella Emanuel coming up here at 106 Central Time.
[01:18:50.273 --> 01:18:52.795]  The great doctor will be joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.238]  But for now, we go back out to the phone lines.
[01:18:55.258 --> 01:19:00.703]  We're asking people if your employee is forcing you to take the COVID vaccine.
[01:19:00.723 --> 01:19:02.164]  We go to Clown Car.
[01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.527]  It's an interesting name to call in with.
[01:19:04.587 --> 01:19:06.709]  From Brooklyn, New York, Clown Car, go ahead.
[01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.405]  I have an issue in New York City here.
[01:19:14.706 --> 01:19:25.243]  A bunch of the different local unions are getting together and with the OSHA requirements they're asking that if you're vaccinated that you get picked for certain jobs.
[01:19:26.465 --> 01:19:36.588]  And by the way, the new OSHA statement is that if your business forces you to take a vaccine and you have a negative side effect, they're held liable.
[01:19:36.908 --> 01:19:47.331]  So if you want to stand up against this forced vaccine at your place of employment, take that claim with you and say, hey, I want you to know if anything happens to me, you're forcing me to do this, you're going to be held liable.
[01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:48.551]  I mean, that's huge.
[01:19:49.517 --> 01:19:50.397]  I know another thing.
[01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:54.581]  The other day I was at the Wonder Wheel, Coney Island, and they have a blood drive, right?
[01:19:54.721 --> 01:19:57.623]  So I said, you know, all right, I'll give some blood to the action if I was vaccinated.
[01:19:57.764 --> 01:19:59.505]  So I said, yeah, I was vaccinated.
[01:19:59.525 --> 01:19:59.645]  Why?
[01:19:59.665 --> 01:20:00.966]  She goes, oh, we can't take your blood.
[01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:01.667]  I said, why not?
[01:20:02.007 --> 01:20:02.808]  They said, we don't know.
[01:20:03.248 --> 01:20:03.829]  We just can't.
[01:20:04.529 --> 01:20:05.370]  Thank God.
[01:20:07.832 --> 01:20:08.973]  Thank God.
[01:20:09.834 --> 01:20:10.755]  Did you know that, though?
[01:20:11.681 --> 01:20:33.189]  No, but you know, I've been talking to some nurses just behind the scenes and some other people, and I've talked about it on air, how one of our big concerns was, what if people are donating blood that had been vaccinated, and then whatever's happening, if that blood ends up being tainted, and then you get unvaccinated people getting hit with the vaccinated blood, and then it just spreads forever, it's exponential.
[01:20:33.549 --> 01:20:37.591]  So I'm glad that blood drives, I hope that that's universal, that they're not
[01:20:37.691 --> 01:20:38.912]  Ryan White effect, I guess, right?
[01:20:59.952 --> 01:21:00.873]  I'm sorry, what?
[01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:04.735]  Ryan White, the young boy who died of AIDS from a blood transfusion, right?
[01:21:04.775 --> 01:21:05.476]  Right, exactly.
[01:21:05.856 --> 01:21:10.158]  And so they don't want to have that happen to them with the COVID vaccine blood transfusions, exactly.
[01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:13.821]  Oh, and I gotta tell you, dude, past couple years now since
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.622]  I guess everybody else has been experiencing the COVID thing for a year and a half.
[01:21:17.862 --> 01:21:22.584]  I've been enlightened probably two years prior, so I've had a bit of an issue.
[01:21:22.604 --> 01:21:28.488]  But that video has definitely saved a lot of our sanity, our lives, probably kept us in the loop with things.
[01:21:29.008 --> 01:21:31.849]  And really, from the bottom of my heart, I just want to thank you guys.
[01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:36.292]  Also, real quick, the other day I spoke to Alex about
[01:21:38.303 --> 01:21:40.565]  Alright, so I'm going to do this without crying this time.
[01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:42.727]  So my son got vaccinated, two and a half months old.
[01:21:42.747 --> 01:21:43.428]  He got a 3 in 1.
[01:21:43.788 --> 01:21:45.890]  He wasn't supposed to get the 3 in 1 vaccination.
[01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:52.135]  So that's why I'm highly against the vaccination of this, not knowing that it's raw.
[01:21:52.215 --> 01:21:56.139]  I said, look, a two and a half month old child died from a 3 in 1 vaccination.
[01:21:56.299 --> 01:21:57.320]  I know because it's my son.
[01:21:58.221 --> 01:21:58.341]  So
[01:21:59.349 --> 01:22:03.210]  And Alex said, well, they said that it was because of SIDS, right?
[01:22:03.411 --> 01:22:09.693]  And I said, yeah, that's because there's an article now that states that that's the lie that they give you when they poison and kill your children.
[01:22:10.073 --> 01:22:15.195]  Because what the answer to SIDS is, well, God just came and took your child back to heaven.
[01:22:15.635 --> 01:22:18.898]  And I'm standing there like, who the fuck am I punching in the face for this one?
[01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:20.880]  Like, who's telling me this dumb shit?
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:24.222]  Bro, they tried to sign us up for- I'm sorry, hey man, we gotta dump that.
[01:22:24.323 --> 01:22:29.647]  You cursed twice, and so now we've run out of the dump, and so I apologize, we have to cut you off though.
[01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:32.509]  I mean, that's just heart-wrenching.
[01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:39.616]  I understand you kinda lose control talking about that, so I don't blame you, but we just have to dump you because we-
[01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:55.983]  For terrestrial radio, we can't say those words, and you only have so much time to dump it, so... Thank you so much for the call, but yeah... This is, you know, this is the sick part about it, and this is why...
[01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:04.722]  When I see these people commenting on the promotion of vaccine posts on social media, like from Kamala Harris or whatever, and it's always the left.
[01:23:05.423 --> 01:23:06.443]  I'm just being honest about it.
[01:23:06.643 --> 01:23:09.864]  I don't like the divide and conquer thing, but I call it like it is, folks.
[01:23:10.145 --> 01:23:17.568]  It's always the libtards, loving the vaccine, promoting the vaccine, and you know, it's just like everything else that they want to talk about and act like they're an expert on.
[01:23:17.888 --> 01:23:19.309]  They don't know jack crap.
[01:23:19.989 --> 01:23:34.883]  And they're so insensitive to the realities of the world, and they're so out of touch to the realities of the world, and until it smacks them in the face in an embarrassing moment of shame, which is what they all need to experience, they'll never get it.
[01:23:37.756 --> 01:23:42.823]  You know, you'll have all of these people say, take the vaccine, safe and effective, and they'll get angry and they'll get in your face.
[01:23:43.404 --> 01:23:50.434]  You know, why don't you, why don't you listen to one of these people that lost a kid from taking the vaccine and tell me that I have to take it and tell me that I have to give it to my kids.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.042]  Why don't you go ahead and try that one, on for size.
[01:23:54.842 --> 01:24:01.346]  With parents bawling their eyes out because they took a healthy baby to the doctor, got him a vaccine, and they died the next day.
[01:24:01.826 --> 01:24:02.146]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:02.366 --> 01:24:07.329]  I'd love to hear you virtue signal about how great vaccines are to those people, you sickos.
[01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:09.810]  Trying to, in your death cult.
[01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:12.512]  Excuse me, let's go on to the next caller here.
[01:24:13.933 --> 01:24:15.514]  Just, oh boy, I'll tell you, man.
[01:24:16.894 --> 01:24:19.136]  I'll tell you, it's sick stuff.
[01:24:20.476 --> 01:24:22.979]  Andy in Washington calling in here.
[01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:24.240]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:24.640]  Go ahead.
[01:24:25.641 --> 01:24:26.122]  Hey, Owen.
[01:24:26.182 --> 01:24:28.284]  It's a pleasure to be on the show.
[01:24:28.304 --> 01:24:29.545]  Endgame.
[01:24:30.185 --> 01:24:31.607]  I've watched Info Wars.
[01:24:31.687 --> 01:24:37.212]  I've been Alex Jones fan for well over 20 years, so thank you for having me on there.
[01:24:37.232 --> 01:24:39.494]  I'm a little upset about that.
[01:24:40.215 --> 01:24:43.979]  Gentlemen, I just heard that his child died and that goes into it.
[01:24:44.039 --> 01:24:45.140]  My cousin works for
[01:24:46.866 --> 01:24:47.407]  The college.
[01:24:47.467 --> 01:24:48.589]  Local community college.
[01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.853]  First time I went out to lunch with her.
[01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:52.355]  Very conservative woman.
[01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:54.959]  Her and I were having the backs talk.
[01:24:54.999 --> 01:24:55.800]  She wouldn't tell me.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.825]  Then she told me that she told her
[01:24:59.904 --> 01:25:05.825]  Students that if they come to work with or come to school with COVID, they fail.
[01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:07.146]  Go get your vaccine.
[01:25:07.526 --> 01:25:10.926]  And this is what's happening in all the schools with the major push with the kids.
[01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.467]  They're going to kill people.
[01:25:12.567 --> 01:25:15.787]  And we need to stand up and fight against this all together.
[01:25:15.807 --> 01:25:16.548]  No, that's it.
[01:25:16.588 --> 01:25:16.968]  Exactly.
[01:25:17.008 --> 01:25:21.268]  And not have this implemented into our schools, into our workforce.
[01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:24.449]  If we don't band together, human society is done.
[01:25:24.769 --> 01:25:25.409]  And guess what?
[01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:28.110]  We're all organs to those elitists.
[01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:41.925]  And exactly, and that's how they look at it, and they figure, hey, if you're so stupid that you'll line up like a sheep for slaughter and volunteer for your own slaughter, then they'll mop you up and they'll say that they're justified in doing so.
[01:25:42.566 --> 01:25:47.649]  And so that's how the globalists work, that's how the elite work, that's how the new satanic Illuminati works.
[01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:53.233]  You volunteered to be sacrificed to this, so we're gonna kill you now.
[01:25:54.113 --> 01:26:02.979]  And you believe it's for your own good, so you volunteered to be killed in a satanic human sacrifice by the satanic New World Order.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.440]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:09.204]  When you talk about this, this is a death cult with the teachers forcing this.
[01:26:09.504 --> 01:26:10.625]  And of course, what's the irony?
[01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:18.771]  Oh, don't come to my classroom with COVID, except if you come into their classroom with the COVID vaccine, you're going into the classroom with COVID.
[01:26:18.811 --> 01:26:19.691]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:26:21.713 --> 01:26:21.813]  And
[01:26:22.601 --> 01:26:23.482]  How are these people?
[01:26:23.502 --> 01:26:25.102]  I don't understand.
[01:26:25.142 --> 01:26:29.664]  We look at the Bible, we look through history, and here they are implementing it to the kids.
[01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:31.445]  We see the trafficking.
[01:26:31.505 --> 01:26:33.666]  You guys have been down there on the border.
[01:26:34.026 --> 01:26:35.687]  You're seeing the human trafficking.
[01:26:35.727 --> 01:26:38.508]  You're seeing the kids being taken.
[01:26:38.609 --> 01:26:39.889]  What are they doing with these kids?
[01:26:39.909 --> 01:26:40.549]  They're shooting them.
[01:26:40.569 --> 01:26:42.770]  They're experimenting with our kids.
[01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:43.611]  What's going to happen?
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.661]  After babies are born with the vaccines, two parents with a vaccine, my mom had a rare disease called Farr disease.
[01:26:51.321 --> 01:27:00.343]  It takes one person, one in one million, and then on the other half you have to have one in one million to get this gene, to get this disease.
[01:27:01.003 --> 01:27:06.764]  What happens when the two parents decide to have intercourse and they produce this biogenetic child?
[01:27:06.904 --> 01:27:08.705]  What is that going to do to everybody?
[01:27:09.245 --> 01:27:10.045]  What's going to happen?
[01:27:10.928 --> 01:27:12.432]  How are we going to save these people?
[01:27:12.452 --> 01:27:15.298]  They are so blind and dumb and they justify it.
[01:27:15.699 --> 01:27:19.689]  My cousin that I'm talking about, her son, my other cousin, he's in the Marine Corps.
[01:27:20.606 --> 01:27:22.607]  Conservative, he got the vax.
[01:27:23.108 --> 01:27:25.769]  He said that the way the world's going, he was going to get it.
[01:27:25.889 --> 01:27:26.770]  He doesn't care.
[01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:34.375]  She said that the most important thing for her is to see her son, so she'd get the vax to get that passport.
[01:27:34.995 --> 01:27:36.236]  And she wants to do things.
[01:27:36.396 --> 01:27:39.458]  And she told me, this is my cousin, conservative.
[01:27:39.658 --> 01:27:42.279]  Well, if you don't get the vax, I guess you don't want to do things.
[01:27:42.339 --> 01:27:44.141]  And I don't see how you could live like that.
[01:27:45.581 --> 01:27:46.342]  I want to live.
[01:27:46.942 --> 01:27:47.883]  You want to live, Owen.
[01:27:49.183 --> 01:27:50.028]  Alex wants to live.
[01:27:50.128 --> 01:27:52.823]  My son, my 13 year old, is anti-vaxxed.
[01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:54.042]  We want to.
[01:27:54.362 --> 01:27:55.823]  We got to put this in together.
[01:27:55.863 --> 01:27:56.743]  We got to band together.
[01:27:57.003 --> 01:28:01.385]  But imagine how sick they are when that's the thing is, oh, you don't want to go to these things.
[01:28:01.405 --> 01:28:02.125]  You don't want to live.
[01:28:02.245 --> 01:28:02.486]  What?
[01:28:02.546 --> 01:28:03.686]  No, I want to live free.
[01:28:03.706 --> 01:28:05.827]  I don't want to live as a slave.
[01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:07.608]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:07.628 --> 01:28:11.249]  So, I mean, that's the thing that they miss is, oh, we just want to live.
[01:28:11.289 --> 01:28:12.129]  That's why we have the vaccines.
[01:28:12.169 --> 01:28:13.550]  No, you want to live as a slave.
[01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:15.451]  I want to live as a free man.
[01:28:15.931 --> 01:28:18.812]  One more segment of your calls and then Dr. Stella Emanuel joins us.
[01:28:20.029 --> 01:28:23.432]  We've got Dr. Stella Emanuel coming up in five minutes.
[01:28:24.013 --> 01:28:26.395]  We've also got the latest propaganda from Joe Biden.
[01:28:26.415 --> 01:28:28.557]  The story is at Infowars.com with the video.
[01:28:29.177 --> 01:28:34.142]  Joe Biden quotes Mao Zedong in speech calling for more women in workforce.
[01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:37.124]  You know, that's an interesting one, isn't it?
[01:28:38.205 --> 01:28:45.032]  They claim they are all about women's empowerment, but yet they want to disenfranchise them and work them for their entire life.
[01:28:46.092 --> 01:28:47.853]  So that's an irony there.
[01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:49.854]  But I digress on that.
[01:28:49.874 --> 01:28:51.035]  We go back to the phone calls.
[01:28:52.656 --> 01:28:54.978]  Let's go to Keith in Oregon.
[01:28:55.738 --> 01:29:00.121]  We're talking about employers mandating the COVID vaccine for their employees.
[01:29:00.181 --> 01:29:01.381]  Keith in Oregon, go ahead.
[01:29:03.363 --> 01:29:04.083]  Great show, Owen.
[01:29:04.123 --> 01:29:05.504]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:29:05.524 --> 01:29:07.505]  Let me tell you my story real quick.
[01:29:08.786 --> 01:29:13.989]  Last summer, I was working in a skilled nursing facility here in Oregon.
[01:29:14.029 --> 01:29:15.110]  I'm a licensed nurse.
[01:29:16.031 --> 01:29:22.494]  And they said, Hey, you know, come Monday, we're going to be mandatory testing everybody.
[01:29:22.534 --> 01:29:27.156]  We need you to sign this, this paper saying that you're going to go along with it.
[01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:29.517]  I'm a bit of a knucklehead.
[01:29:29.537 --> 01:29:30.857]  And I said, no, I'm not doing that.
[01:29:31.398 --> 01:29:32.358]  And they said, why not?
[01:29:32.518 --> 01:29:34.939]  And I said, because you're not going to push me around.
[01:29:34.959 --> 01:29:35.940]  You're not going to tell me what to do.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.340]  You're not going to look inside my body.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:43.043]  And you know, I have, I have the constitution behind.
[01:29:43.323 --> 01:29:43.483]  So,
[01:29:44.659 --> 01:29:45.799]  They didn't like that very much.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.561]  No, because they view themselves as more important than the Constitution now.
[01:29:51.362 --> 01:29:57.324]  Well, I think my administrators and the managers were receiving a lot of pressure from the state.
[01:29:57.424 --> 01:30:00.005]  It really wasn't the people that I was working for.
[01:30:00.045 --> 01:30:02.086]  It's more the state putting a lot of pressure on them.
[01:30:02.106 --> 01:30:03.507]  Sure, and I was speaking in generalities.
[01:30:03.527 --> 01:30:04.527]  Let me be more specific.
[01:30:05.267 --> 01:30:12.610]  The medical complex, the medical industry, views itself as God, and so therefore it's more important than the U.S.
[01:30:12.650 --> 01:30:13.110]  Constitution.
[01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:14.251]  It's more important than your freedom.
[01:30:15.882 --> 01:30:16.842]  That appears to be the case.
[01:30:17.883 --> 01:30:18.003]  Yeah.
[01:30:18.043 --> 01:30:21.504]  So, but you know, it's up, it's up to us to resist that.
[01:30:21.624 --> 01:30:24.525]  So anyways, like I say, I, uh, I said no.
[01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:25.666]  And then they said, why?
[01:30:25.706 --> 01:30:34.589]  And then I just wrote down, I said, I'm not going to tell you why, but what I wrote down on the, on the paper, I said, I declined and I wrote down title seven, 1964.
[01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:41.532]  I'd love to run this past Barnes and see what he has to say about it, but title seven.
[01:30:42.887 --> 01:30:47.749]  The year 1964 is the Civil Rights Act, right?
[01:30:47.869 --> 01:30:50.611]  Which is a huge umbrella of protection.
[01:30:51.711 --> 01:31:01.616]  And so, basically what it says is that I'm declining this on religious grounds, and they can't even ask me what my religion is.
[01:31:02.536 --> 01:31:02.677]  See?
[01:31:04.463 --> 01:31:16.256]  Anyhow, they didn't like that very much, and the only choice they had at that point was to lay me off, which I was prepared to take the rest of the summer off, take care of a family member anyways.
[01:31:16.356 --> 01:31:17.377]  It worked out fine for me.
[01:31:17.817 --> 01:31:21.722]  However, I could have sued their butts off if I wanted to.
[01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:27.968]  Well, and there's going to have to be mass lawsuits to stop this, unfortunately, and nobody likes getting involved in litigation like that.
[01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:30.370]  But that's just going to have to be the case.
[01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:31.911]  But I mean, think about how crazy it is.
[01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:41.180]  Not only do they not even value or respect the Constitution, I mean, there should be a common sense approach to this where it's like, hey, specifically, the U.S.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.721]  government has been caught
[01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:48.284]  Testing on the population with vaccines before, it's the Tuskegee experiment.
[01:31:48.685 --> 01:31:50.166]  Why would we be trusting the U.S.
[01:31:50.206 --> 01:31:53.768]  government to now implement and force us to take this vaccine knowing their history?
[01:31:54.129 --> 01:32:00.953]  Why would we be forced to take a Pfizer vaccine knowing their history, settling the biggest healthcare fraud payouts in history?
[01:32:01.194 --> 01:32:08.659]  Why would we be taking these vaccines we're forced to take when we have a secret court that's paid out billions of dollars in vaccine damages?
[01:32:08.979 --> 01:32:09.680]  See, but no!
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.502]  The medical industry is in charge of you now.
[01:32:12.542 --> 01:32:17.086]  They hate that Constitution that makes you be free and make up your own mind and your own decisions.
[01:32:17.126 --> 01:32:17.686]  They hate that.
[01:32:17.746 --> 01:32:19.027]  They should be in charge of you.
[01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:20.829]  They should make your decisions for you.
[01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:22.410]  That's what they want people to think.
[01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:24.251]  That's why they're trying to get rid of the Constitution.
[01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:28.615]  That's why Bill of Rights says... Joe Biden says the Bill of Rights is not a document.
[01:32:28.675 --> 01:32:29.355]  It can be changed.
[01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.136]  It doesn't even exist.
[01:32:30.176 --> 01:32:30.997]  You don't have any rights.
[01:32:31.277 --> 01:32:34.820]  And now they're quoting China, praising China, praising Mao Zedong.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:35.981]  Unbelievable.
[01:32:36.001 --> 01:32:37.042]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:32:37.102 --> 01:32:37.382]  All right.
[01:32:39.278 --> 01:32:48.126]  We just did an hour of calls talking about people who are being forced to take the experimental jab to stay employed.
[01:32:48.987 --> 01:32:52.070]  I'm not sure if we're going to be taking any more phone calls so the people still on the line you can let go.
[01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:55.653]  When we come back, Dr. Stella Emanuel joins us for the next hour.
[01:32:56.134 --> 01:32:58.436]  Tell your friends and family to tune in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:58.516 --> 01:33:01.178]  It's going to be very, very important.
[01:33:01.258 --> 01:33:02.519]  We're trying to save lives here.
[01:33:04.081 --> 01:33:04.942]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:06.277 --> 01:33:08.439]  Dr. Stella Emanuel is with us.
[01:33:08.499 --> 01:33:22.234]  She has been such a fearless leader, a trailblazer at the beginning of this pandemic, calling out the lies of the mainstream media, calling out the intentional sabotage of known
[01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:28.072]  Drugs and therapeutics that could stop people from dying from COVID.
[01:33:28.492 --> 01:33:29.613]  She was attacked for that.
[01:33:30.133 --> 01:33:31.834]  We had other doctors get attacked for that.
[01:33:31.954 --> 01:33:36.976]  We saw corrupt governors ban the use of hydroxychloroquine that saved lives.
[01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:39.237]  Well, that's where we were.
[01:33:39.337 --> 01:33:41.798]  Now we're at a new level of these vaccines coming out.
[01:33:41.858 --> 01:33:44.819]  I'm interested to hear Dr. Stella Emanuel's take on that.
[01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:48.401]  But you know, first, as I bring the good doctor in here,
[01:33:49.869 --> 01:33:55.832]  Dr. Emmanuel, just talk about in general the journey for yourself in the last year.
[01:33:56.392 --> 01:34:06.637]  You probably never expected to be in a leadership role like you are in now, but yet here you are, one of the few and proud and strong truth-tellers about the COVID pandemic, the
[01:34:07.697 --> 01:34:13.019]  The therapeutics that were told we couldn't use that could have saved lives, and now of course the vaccine coming out.
[01:34:13.039 --> 01:34:20.062]  So just talk about your journey, the beginning of COVID, what you were thinking, what led you to that famous speech at the U.S.
[01:34:20.082 --> 01:34:27.225]  Capitol on the steps, how shocked were you when you found out that governments were banning the use of hydroxychloroquine, something we knew worked.
[01:34:28.025 --> 01:34:30.346]  Just talk about your story for the last year or so.
[01:34:30.686 --> 01:34:32.667]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, thank you for joining us.
[01:34:33.806 --> 01:34:36.070]  I'm really honored and excited to be here.
[01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:39.034]  I mean, I love Alex and I've always loved his show.
[01:34:39.695 --> 01:34:41.298]  Listen, it's really been a
[01:34:42.146 --> 01:34:47.247]  I would say it's been a crazy year and it's just been something that I do believe that God actually prepared me for this.
[01:34:47.747 --> 01:34:51.128]  You know, I was in Houston running an urgent care clinic.
[01:34:51.348 --> 01:34:52.649]  I'm actually a trained pediatrician.
[01:34:52.689 --> 01:34:58.590]  I did general medicine back home, came here and did pediatrics, then started working in the emergency room.
[01:34:58.990 --> 01:35:03.151]  So I kind of kept working in the emergency room and also on a pediatric clinic in Louisiana.
[01:35:03.511 --> 01:35:10.153]  A few years ago, I moved to Houston and opened up this urgent care clinic, urgent care type clinic.
[01:35:10.894 --> 01:35:20.740]  And so this is where we were when COVID hit and it was really, really scary because about 15 to 20% of my patients are from Asia, Middle East and stuff like that.
[01:35:21.361 --> 01:35:28.906]  So we just initially just jumped into the PPE and we got all masked up and everything and it was just, we were scared, you know.
[01:35:29.651 --> 01:35:36.955]  And then a pharmacy friend of mine told me that they're getting news out of Europe and out of China that hydroxychloroquine works.
[01:35:37.555 --> 01:35:38.916]  I trained in West Africa.
[01:35:39.256 --> 01:35:40.057]  I trained in Nigeria.
[01:35:40.117 --> 01:35:48.741]  I'm from Cameroon originally, but I trained in West Africa and Nigeria, so I'm used to using hydroxychloroquine, camoquine, mefloquine, all the queens.
[01:35:48.941 --> 01:35:56.025]  And by the way, these are really cheap therapeutics that are known to be effective, and so that's why they were used so much in West Africa.
[01:35:56.926 --> 01:35:57.166]  Yes.
[01:35:57.326 --> 01:36:05.155]  In fact, we took it weekly for prevention of malaria and it's given to children, to old people, to pregnant women.
[01:36:05.375 --> 01:36:09.140]  In fact, my colleagues at Sunday Sunday Medicine back in Nigeria were showing, you know.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.144]  So, I was very excited when I heard about it because I'm used to the medications.
[01:36:13.164 --> 01:36:14.626]  I know they are safe, they are effective.
[01:36:14.886 --> 01:36:17.249]  So, I immediately just started using it for patients.
[01:36:18.357 --> 01:36:19.517]  And it was awesome.
[01:36:19.597 --> 01:36:21.138]  I mean, people were doing very well.
[01:36:21.418 --> 01:36:24.719]  Initially, I just used the malaria dose because that's what I was used to.
[01:36:25.119 --> 01:36:33.361]  And then we started getting information from Dr. Didi-Rahou from France and Dr. Zelenko and all the other trailblazers.
[01:36:33.722 --> 01:36:38.543]  So we modified it and I started using the doses that they were recommending and adding Zitomax and zinc.
[01:36:39.497 --> 01:36:40.458]  Tremendous results.
[01:36:40.838 --> 01:36:41.819]  People were getting better.
[01:36:41.919 --> 01:36:46.943]  If people got sick in like two days, people got better like immediately, some 24 hours, some 48 hours.
[01:36:47.424 --> 01:36:51.046]  If they had been sick a little longer, it took them a little longer to get better.
[01:36:51.066 --> 01:36:53.168]  So I was so excited.
[01:36:53.268 --> 01:36:58.773]  So I went online on all the doctor groups and I was part of all these big doctor groups.
[01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.034]  I have about 30,000 doctors.
[01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:02.276]  I was like, yes, I'm using hydroxychloroquine.
[01:37:02.296 --> 01:37:02.936]  It's working.
[01:37:03.376 --> 01:37:04.217]  This is awesome.
[01:37:04.237 --> 01:37:04.958]  We have a treatment.
[01:37:04.978 --> 01:37:06.279]  I got attacked.
[01:37:07.576 --> 01:37:08.777]  These doctors attacked me.
[01:37:08.797 --> 01:37:14.341]  They told me, no, we have to, we need a double-blinded randomized control study.
[01:37:14.401 --> 01:37:15.522]  I said, no, we don't.
[01:37:15.943 --> 01:37:16.923]  The medicine is working.
[01:37:17.584 --> 01:37:32.415]  Then I went and dug in and I found an article that was written under the INH, actually under Anthony Fauci in 2005, that said chloroquine was a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1.
[01:37:32.895 --> 01:37:35.717]  SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, they're all coronaviruses.
[01:37:35.737 --> 01:37:36.538]  They are very similar.
[01:37:37.142 --> 01:37:38.843]  So this was under Anthony Fauci.
[01:37:38.863 --> 01:37:43.304]  So I was really shocked when I saw him online saying that it doesn't work and everything.
[01:37:43.344 --> 01:37:44.985]  So it was just shocking to me.
[01:37:45.685 --> 01:37:47.086]  So we started using it.
[01:37:47.126 --> 01:37:48.666]  People were getting treated.
[01:37:48.706 --> 01:37:49.807]  We were fighting online.
[01:37:49.987 --> 01:37:52.708]  And that is how we got together, all the doctors.
[01:37:53.008 --> 01:37:54.629]  I met Dr. Osso, Dr. Bryant.
[01:37:54.689 --> 01:38:02.372]  I mean, we just met just people that were taking care of patients and fighting online and on YouTube and on Facebook and on Twitter.
[01:38:02.712 --> 01:38:05.613]  We just took the fight online because the people around us, they don't want to hear it.
[01:38:06.337 --> 01:38:08.419]  So we started finding people that had like-mind.
[01:38:09.119 --> 01:38:26.092]  So this is April, March, April, and we're talking, we're fighting, we're bringing literature, we're bringing literature as done in other places, we're bringing testimonies from other doctors that have seen patients, we're even bringing live testimony of patients that got better.
[01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:30.396]  Like remember there was a lawmaker, I think in Michigan, that got treated and got better.
[01:38:31.036 --> 01:38:35.280]  So we're bringing all this thing and giving to these doctors and they were just like, no, it doesn't work.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.822]  We want to randomize controlled studies.
[01:38:37.842 --> 01:38:38.402]  It doesn't work.
[01:38:38.782 --> 01:38:39.723]  At some point I was like, what?
[01:38:39.783 --> 01:38:40.784]  Are you guys computers?
[01:38:40.884 --> 01:38:42.966]  Randomized, double-blinded, double-blinded.
[01:38:42.986 --> 01:38:43.606]  What's wrong with you?
[01:38:44.827 --> 01:38:53.754]  So by like May, I knew that it was not, it was really not a science battle because what they were saying had no science to it.
[01:38:54.435 --> 01:38:55.396]  It was not even
[01:38:56.638 --> 01:39:02.660]  It had nothing to do with, I just thought that this had nothing to do with coronavirus because there was something going on that was more sinister.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:08.301]  At that time, I started realizing that there was a serious propaganda battle going on.
[01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:16.543]  We're getting a little bit of censorship on Facebook and Twitter, but not that much yet.
[01:39:16.563 --> 01:39:22.185]  You're answering the question I was going to ask, so let me just ask the question so that the audience can even have a better understanding of what you're saying here.
[01:39:22.805 --> 01:39:27.828]  So what were the thoughts going through your head, and I know you're just kind of explaining it, but I really want to encapsulate here.
[01:39:28.348 --> 01:39:45.058]  What are the thoughts going through your head at this time when, for all intents and purposes, you found a cure for COVID, for coronavirus, which has already been used to treat malaria and other diseases, and it's just known, hydroxychloroquine, for just preventing other infections as well.
[01:39:45.778 --> 01:39:48.699]  And so you find this cure, you share it with doctors, you get attacked.
[01:39:48.979 --> 01:39:51.660]  You learn that Fauci is known about this, but he's not promoting it.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.221]  But again, what's going through your head at this period of time?
[01:39:55.402 --> 01:39:57.763]  It was mind-boggling, not just for me, for all of us.
[01:39:58.243 --> 01:40:04.085]  At this time, Dr. Armstrong, the state board had come after him for treating patients in the nursing home.
[01:40:04.625 --> 01:40:08.387]  Also, the state board had come after him, so it was really mind-boggling.
[01:40:09.447 --> 01:40:11.128]  We kept like, what is going on?
[01:40:11.208 --> 01:40:11.788]  We're telling you
[01:40:12.372 --> 01:40:13.192]  This is working.
[01:40:13.393 --> 01:40:14.473]  Pitches are getting better.
[01:40:14.493 --> 01:40:16.474]  Instead of everybody like, okay, good.
[01:40:16.514 --> 01:40:18.155]  We need to see what you're doing and do it.
[01:40:18.876 --> 01:40:19.936]  Zelenko was being attacked.
[01:40:20.016 --> 01:40:21.597]  Dr. Raho in France was being attacked.
[01:40:21.617 --> 01:40:23.978]  So it was mind boggling for all of us.
[01:40:24.338 --> 01:40:29.781]  So we decided that, you know what, this was just, by May, I decided this was not a science battle.
[01:40:30.462 --> 01:40:31.983]  This was a propaganda battle.
[01:40:32.563 --> 01:40:34.884]  And because of some of the things, I'm also a pastor.
[01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:35.985]  I'm a minister of the gospel.
[01:40:36.225 --> 01:40:40.347]  Because of the things, some of the things that God had been showing me, I realized it was a spiritual battle.
[01:40:41.067 --> 01:40:41.808]  So by May,
[01:40:42.389 --> 01:40:44.010]  I was done playing this nice guy.
[01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:48.333]  When I go online and if somebody attacks me, I went after them with everything.
[01:40:48.373 --> 01:40:49.914]  I threw everything, the kitchen sink at them.
[01:40:50.474 --> 01:40:54.436]  So I started like coming after them the same way that they were coming after me, they would back off.
[01:40:55.237 --> 01:40:56.898]  So I was like, no, you can't do this.
[01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:58.679]  Oh no, you're not showing that.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:00.080]  Yes.
[01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:03.702]  So I was, I was just done.
[01:41:03.942 --> 01:41:07.724]  I told you, my colleagues, I said, you cannot keep coming to a street fight with a coat.
[01:41:08.565 --> 01:41:12.067]  So by the time we got to, to DC, I was done.
[01:41:12.526 --> 01:41:18.230]  I was like, I cannot keep, I cannot even, I was done, I was ready, I was ready to be the attack dog.
[01:41:18.931 --> 01:41:23.334]  The doctors were still trying to be nice to me, so the doctor, I was like, no, I'm not doing nice anymore.
[01:41:23.374 --> 01:41:33.722]  But you noticed that it was, it was, it was your speech that day that got the most attention and was the most viral, powerful speech and video from that day was your speech.
[01:41:34.762 --> 01:41:35.023]  Yes.
[01:41:35.163 --> 01:41:36.283]  The thing is this, right?
[01:41:36.704 --> 01:41:40.967]  We have also really been praying for the nation and praying for what's going on because I'm a prayer warrior.
[01:41:41.465 --> 01:41:49.548]  So we have been praying and I do believe that on that day, it was God, the whole world was caged in fear.
[01:41:49.588 --> 01:41:55.071]  The whole world, the globe was caged in this prison of fear and we're all going to die.
[01:41:55.491 --> 01:41:56.211]  We're all going to die.
[01:41:56.271 --> 01:41:57.412]  It was just fear.
[01:41:57.732 --> 01:41:58.572]  It was palpable.
[01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:02.774]  There were people that had been locked up in their homes for three months and had not come out of their home.
[01:42:03.374 --> 01:42:07.876]  So, that day when I got there, it was just God that just hit it and said, you know what?
[01:42:08.437 --> 01:42:13.199]  If I knew that God was going to amplify my voice, because it was just God that said, you know what?
[01:42:13.599 --> 01:42:15.260]  Let me break fear over the world.
[01:42:15.894 --> 01:42:18.877]  So when I spoke that, there's something broke in the spirit.
[01:42:19.297 --> 01:42:21.739]  All of a sudden, people were like, oh my God, we're not all gonna die.
[01:42:21.759 --> 01:42:22.339]  There's hope.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.400]  It is possible.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:24.221]  There are possibilities.
[01:42:24.441 --> 01:42:25.162]  That's amazing.
[01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:27.924]  God working through Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[01:42:27.964 --> 01:42:29.545]  We got a break here, but we'll be right back.
[01:42:29.565 --> 01:42:31.067]  Folks, tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:42:31.087 --> 01:42:31.687]  This is amazing.
[01:42:31.987 --> 01:42:38.032]  We are hearing the incredible story of her COVID testimony, really, of dealing with it.
[01:42:38.673 --> 01:42:44.538]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, what led to that epic speech on the nation's capital.
[01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:49.622]  And here's the analogy for the story that she told in the last segment.
[01:42:49.702 --> 01:42:59.424]  Imagine you're a doctor, you go into some village somewhere, where they're having a big outbreak of some disease, and you come into the village, and you have a treatment, and it's working!
[01:42:59.504 --> 01:43:09.907]  And all of these people that were dying, all of a sudden are getting healthy, and they're up and walking and enjoying their lives again, and you're feeling good about it, you're saving lives, you're helping people, and then out of nowhere, a bunch of guys show up in black suits,
[01:43:10.427 --> 01:43:15.190]  Steal all of the medication you're using and throw it into a van and drive away.
[01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:17.011]  And you're like, hey, what's happening?
[01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:17.671]  What are you doing?
[01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:18.332]  This was working.
[01:43:18.372 --> 01:43:25.976]  And then they come back and they take you and throw you in the same van that they just put all the ingredients for the medicines that you were using in that were helping people.
[01:43:26.217 --> 01:43:29.579]  And then they drive away and the disease continues to spread in that village.
[01:43:29.619 --> 01:43:31.940]  That's basically the analogy I would use.
[01:43:32.881 --> 01:43:37.964]  But, you know, going back for just a moment here, Dr. Stella Emanuel with us on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:39.111 --> 01:43:42.794]  And then we'll continue your testimony and get into where we're at now with the vaccines.
[01:43:42.834 --> 01:43:44.195]  But, I mean, what did you think?
[01:43:44.215 --> 01:43:56.443]  I found it amazing that you had these doctors that were demanding more studies, more randomized studies about hydroxychloroquine, something that's been used successfully for decades, prescribed to presidents.
[01:43:57.183 --> 01:44:13.432]  When they travel the world to Nigeria and other places for malaria, as you were discussing, but yet they don't have those same demands over this vaccine, over the COVID vaccine that isn't even really by definition a vaccine, has not been FDA approved, has not been tested on humans.
[01:44:13.452 --> 01:44:16.234]  I mean, to me, how do you even react to that?
[01:44:16.254 --> 01:44:17.415]  I mean, how can doctors
[01:44:18.155 --> 01:44:25.517]  How can doctors be going along with this or saying, oh no, we need all these tests for hydroxychloroquine, but then they don't have that same approach to the vaccine?
[01:44:25.557 --> 01:44:27.297]  That stuns me, Dr. Emmanuel.
[01:44:28.297 --> 01:44:30.958]  I think, like I said, this is a spiritual battle.
[01:44:31.178 --> 01:44:42.641]  I think as we discuss further, some stuff that I just discovered recently to realize just how much they are programming people with the whole human 2.0 thing is crazy.
[01:44:43.328 --> 01:44:46.430]  But you know, at that time, we were just trying to take care of patients.
[01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:50.334]  We were just trying to take care of patients, and it was really mind-boggling.
[01:44:50.994 --> 01:44:54.377]  We were talking with each other, and I remember the first day I met Dr. Richard.
[01:44:54.517 --> 01:44:55.998]  Also, we talked and we discussed.
[01:44:56.258 --> 01:44:56.919]  He's in Houston.
[01:44:56.999 --> 01:45:00.682]  We were like, oh my God, I feel like finally there was somebody around here.
[01:45:00.702 --> 01:45:01.863]  I was not alone.
[01:45:02.243 --> 01:45:04.264]  The next day, he called me and he couldn't reach me.
[01:45:04.285 --> 01:45:06.907]  I was in clinic, and he thought something bad had happened to me.
[01:45:07.207 --> 01:45:09.669]  That is the kind of terror we were living under at that time.
[01:45:10.407 --> 01:45:18.773]  So when we, again, of course, Simone put together this conference in Washington, D.C., and I was invited.
[01:45:19.393 --> 01:45:23.216]  So when I got there, I told the doctors, I said, y'all play nice.
[01:45:23.356 --> 01:45:23.656]  I'm done.
[01:45:24.116 --> 01:45:25.277]  I am seriously done.
[01:45:25.457 --> 01:45:29.460]  I am ready to just beat up whatever needs to be done today.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:35.844]  When I left home, I told my family, I said, if I'm going to D.C., I don't care what happens to me.
[01:45:36.224 --> 01:45:37.845]  I'm not going to continue to let people die.
[01:45:37.945 --> 01:45:39.006]  If I perish, I perish.
[01:45:39.377 --> 01:45:40.618]  They were like, oh no, don't say that.
[01:45:40.998 --> 01:45:46.363]  I said, you know, if you don't leave us, if you, if you are not willing to die for something, then you're going to fall for anything.
[01:45:46.803 --> 01:45:48.244]  So I was like, if I said, I don't care.
[01:45:48.284 --> 01:45:49.225]  If they kill me, they kill me.
[01:45:49.305 --> 01:45:50.446]  I'm just going to have to take everything.
[01:45:50.466 --> 01:45:54.009]  So that is where I was when I stood in front of the Supreme Court that day.
[01:45:54.029 --> 01:45:54.790]  And I said, you know what?
[01:45:55.130 --> 01:45:58.613]  If this is the heel I get nailed on, this is the heel I get nailed on.
[01:45:58.673 --> 01:46:00.054]  Anthony Fauci is lying.
[01:46:00.094 --> 01:46:02.116]  Sanjay Gupta doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:46:02.216 --> 01:46:03.577]  And I just went off.
[01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.438]  They should bring Anthony Fauci's urine.
[01:46:05.478 --> 01:46:06.179]  Let's test it.
[01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:07.300]  I was done.
[01:46:07.796 --> 01:46:10.357]  And I was ready to, like, I don't care what any of you say.
[01:46:10.717 --> 01:46:15.798]  And I'm glad because, you know, whenever you get to that place of if I perish, I perish, you never perish.
[01:46:16.539 --> 01:46:18.639]  So that day, it was, it was wild.
[01:46:18.679 --> 01:46:20.380]  I went back to my hotel room and people called me.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.000]  Hey, Stella, guess what?
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:23.761]  4 million views.
[01:46:23.841 --> 01:46:24.281]  I said, what?
[01:46:24.641 --> 01:46:25.962]  They said 8 million views.
[01:46:26.022 --> 01:46:26.482]  I said, what?
[01:46:26.502 --> 01:46:29.703]  They said, oh my God, listen, Don Junior just retweeted you.
[01:46:29.743 --> 01:46:30.503]  I said, what?
[01:46:30.863 --> 01:46:32.023]  They said the president retweeted you.
[01:46:32.063 --> 01:46:33.284]  I said, whoa!
[01:46:33.604 --> 01:46:33.984]  And boom.
[01:46:34.758 --> 01:46:36.720]  They started the fight.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.682]  They tried to block me.
[01:46:38.742 --> 01:46:39.543]  They banned me.
[01:46:39.603 --> 01:46:40.604]  They cut me out.
[01:46:41.045 --> 01:46:49.614]  They went and pulled up my ministry and they turned me into Trump's demon sperm doctor and they just, ooh, they tried to destroy me.
[01:46:49.794 --> 01:46:50.755]  They did everything.
[01:46:50.815 --> 01:46:51.476]  It's like they wanted to
[01:46:51.946 --> 01:46:54.789]  So I was like, well, y'all don't even know, I'm a warrior.
[01:46:54.809 --> 01:46:56.852]  I was like, y'all don't even know me, I'm a warrior.
[01:46:56.872 --> 01:46:59.414]  So when CNN came after me and they were talking, I said, y'all, these CNN people,
[01:47:13.735 --> 01:47:18.717]  I just one hour in the room with one of them and I was casting demons out of them.
[01:47:18.737 --> 01:47:20.357]  They'll be sitting on the floor like snakes.
[01:47:20.798 --> 01:47:24.359]  I was like, I was just, I went off after them and then they kind of backed off.
[01:47:24.999 --> 01:47:31.361]  But of course, Twitter, Facebook and everything started doing all kinds of, um, anytime we said anything, they will ban it.
[01:47:31.441 --> 01:47:34.302]  Anytime when, when I'm coming on a show, they're banning.
[01:47:35.003 --> 01:47:36.523]  You know, there's a very interesting story.
[01:47:36.663 --> 01:47:41.185]  There was a story about, um, let me just say this because I mean, you know, Alex has been through this a lot.
[01:47:41.664 --> 01:47:48.208]  There's a story about a farmer, I don't know whether you can see it, a farmer that bought a rat trap, a mouse trap.
[01:47:48.248 --> 01:47:53.851]  So the mouse came and he's telling the chickens and the pigs and the cows that, oh my God, the farmer bought a mouse trap.
[01:47:53.871 --> 01:47:55.812]  They said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't worry about it.
[01:47:55.852 --> 01:47:56.732]  It's not our problem.
[01:47:57.393 --> 01:48:00.074]  Of course, the first day they put the trap, it caught a snake.
[01:48:00.715 --> 01:48:04.097]  When the farmer's wife went to touch the snake, the snake bit the farmer's wife.
[01:48:04.717 --> 01:48:07.639]  As the snake bit the farmer's wife, the doctor came and said they needed chicken soup.
[01:48:08.179 --> 01:48:09.960]  So they killed the chicken to make the soup.
[01:48:10.686 --> 01:48:12.207]  And people start coming to visit them.
[01:48:12.527 --> 01:48:14.347]  They kill the pig to entertain the people.
[01:48:14.827 --> 01:48:19.309]  The farmer's wife died, and then they killed the cow for the whole village that came to eat.
[01:48:20.289 --> 01:48:21.610]  The mouse was still alive.
[01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:24.591]  That's what happens to Alex Jones.
[01:48:24.851 --> 01:48:28.092]  When they block Alex, everybody was like, oh, he bad, he bad.
[01:48:28.232 --> 01:48:32.253]  But now, all the cows, the chickens, the goats, everything is being killed.
[01:48:32.814 --> 01:48:35.134]  That is where we are right now, and it's just sad.
[01:48:35.334 --> 01:48:36.315]  Yeah, that's incredible.
[01:48:36.795 --> 01:48:39.596]  That is a great story, a parable, if you will, that you say.
[01:48:40.316 --> 01:48:46.257]  Yeah, like all the other animals that saw the trap laid for Alex Jones for the censorship, they said, oh, we're not Alex Jones.
[01:48:46.277 --> 01:48:46.717]  We don't care.
[01:48:46.777 --> 01:48:47.557]  Oh, we're not the mouse.
[01:48:47.597 --> 01:48:48.097]  We don't care.
[01:48:48.697 --> 01:48:50.338]  Well, now, you know, we're still here.
[01:48:50.398 --> 01:48:51.578]  We're still getting the big interviews.
[01:48:51.598 --> 01:48:52.678]  We still have our own platform.
[01:48:53.858 --> 01:48:54.078]  Yes.
[01:48:54.458 --> 01:48:59.019]  And just an example, you know, Steven Crowder, he's having to sue YouTube now.
[01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:00.760]  He's moved all of his content to Rumble.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.380]  So, you know, and he's been supportive of us as well.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.340]  But I mean, it's just this is what's happening.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.981]  Either we all stand together against censorship or we all end up getting censored.
[01:49:10.091 --> 01:49:11.392]  Actually, this thing is serious.
[01:49:11.492 --> 01:49:19.838]  I think it's way deeper than censorship, it's way deeper than even Fauci, it's way deeper than even Gates.
[01:49:19.958 --> 01:49:22.420]  I mean, we know what they want to do to us.
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.261]  It's so deep.
[01:49:24.681 --> 01:49:33.067]  I have been praying and, you know, from like almost maybe 2011, the law started showing me that they had genetically modified people in the land.
[01:49:33.348 --> 01:49:34.809]  And when I said it, people thought I was crazy.
[01:49:34.829 --> 01:49:37.851]  They thought, well, they thought I had gone down a rabbit hole or something.
[01:49:38.536 --> 01:49:39.597]  But this is what we're seeing.
[01:49:39.737 --> 01:49:47.480]  So recently I started, you know, sometimes when you've prayed and prayed and prayed, God will just open the place and you will see the secret behind what they are doing.
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.781]  I went and found these videos.
[01:49:49.861 --> 01:49:51.501]  It's on my Rumble channel, Real Dr. Stella.
[01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:57.004]  I went and found all these videos that these people, they want to, Human 2.0, they are really serious.
[01:49:58.064 --> 01:50:08.008]  I mean, the vaccine, this vaccine, the COVID vaccine was actually manufactured or created or whatever, would actually, would dampen.
[01:50:08.786 --> 01:50:13.650]  When you see the CEO of Modena ties up saying that they are hacking human software.
[01:50:14.431 --> 01:50:19.575]  It was actually done between DARPA and it was paid for by BARDA, the Biomedical Research Institute.
[01:50:19.595 --> 01:50:20.756]  These are governmental agencies.
[01:50:20.776 --> 01:50:21.977]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:50:22.397 --> 01:50:31.185]  And if you go on our Rumble channel, you will see there's a certain doctor there that used to, Dr. Cruz, that used to work for DARPA, that is now working for the Platypus Institute.
[01:50:32.285 --> 01:50:40.948]  This is the perfect time to take a break because this is where we can go in the next segment.
[01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:46.850]  We're beginning to go next level and so I'm really excited for this next segment.
[01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:47.731]  We've got to take a break.
[01:50:47.811 --> 01:50:49.431]  We'll be right back with Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[01:50:49.471 --> 01:50:50.752]  Folks, please remember...
[01:50:51.352 --> 01:50:53.336]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:53.396 --> 01:50:56.721]  Shop there so that we can have this platform and do the powerful interviews.
[01:50:57.062 --> 01:50:58.985]  I have a feeling this interview is going to go totally viral.
[01:50:59.025 --> 01:50:59.907]  It's been so powerful.
[01:51:00.147 --> 01:51:03.072]  And we still have two segments left with Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[01:51:04.195 --> 01:51:06.816]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:06.877 --> 01:51:08.998]  Our guest, Dr. Stella Emanuel with us.
[01:51:09.998 --> 01:51:17.663]  In the last segment, she was talking about the rabbit hole of human 2.0, GMO, genetically modified humans.
[01:51:17.843 --> 01:51:21.285]  And you know, there is a going down the rabbit hole aspect of this.
[01:51:22.085 --> 01:51:28.307]  Which is the hidden history of humans, the ancient hieroglyphs, the megaliths.
[01:51:28.507 --> 01:51:32.588]  There's obviously a part of human history that we don't understand yet or that we're being lied to about.
[01:51:32.848 --> 01:51:38.989]  But for me, it's not even necessarily having that background of going down the rabbit hole.
[01:51:39.049 --> 01:51:48.192]  To me, it's if you're living in this moment and you're being intellectually honest with yourself and observant, you have to realize, wow, if they're forcing us
[01:51:49.815 --> 01:52:08.432]  If they're forcing humans to take this experimental gene-modifying, DNA-modifying, what they're calling a vaccine, hasn't been tested on humans, hasn't been FDA approved, they've sold hundreds of millions of these, they want billions of these administered throughout the planet,
[01:52:09.373 --> 01:52:12.496]  And we don't know what the short-term or long-term side effects are.
[01:52:13.137 --> 01:52:19.643]  And so you just, you see, you have to sit there and be intellectually honest with yourself and ask, is this the first time this has been done to humans?
[01:52:19.983 --> 01:52:28.511]  How many times have humans been experienced, experienced, human experiments throughout human history by the world elite, like what we're seeing now?
[01:52:29.232 --> 01:52:33.075]  And so, so I guess my lead into this would be
[01:52:34.296 --> 01:52:43.959]  What do you think, or how does this apply to when you see the videos and the images of people that have been vaccinated, they're magnetic on their arm?
[01:52:44.499 --> 01:52:46.340]  I don't know if you've seen this yet, Dr. Emmanuel.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:46.980]  Maybe you haven't.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:48.321]  We can show you some of the videos.
[01:52:48.681 --> 01:52:54.843]  But so, I mean, talk about what you, what you mean when you talk about human 2.0, genetically modified humans and that rabbit hole.
[01:52:55.963 --> 01:52:57.744]  Okay, listen, it's not even a rabbit hole.
[01:52:57.764 --> 01:52:58.304]  Let me just say that.
[01:52:58.886 --> 01:53:04.012]  I did a video recently and it's called The COVID Pandemic, The Whole Truth.
[01:53:04.513 --> 01:53:07.716]  Everything behind it is on my Roomba channel and everybody can go watch it.
[01:53:08.017 --> 01:53:12.963]  Because actually, okay, these people actually work for DARPA and they are scientists.
[01:53:13.443 --> 01:53:17.528]  We had a talk by Dr. Charles Monk talking about how they want to
[01:53:18.027 --> 01:53:18.587]  We're good to go!
[01:53:48.766 --> 01:53:52.529]  But that technology, initially, you needed to be able to actually put a cap on somebody's head.
[01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:53.129]  Yes, that is it.
[01:53:53.389 --> 01:53:54.550]  COVID-19, the full picture.
[01:53:54.610 --> 01:53:55.371]  The Great Reset.
[01:53:55.591 --> 01:53:56.231]  Human 2.0.
[01:53:56.471 --> 01:53:57.212]  The Mark of the Beast.
[01:53:57.832 --> 01:54:04.537]  I mean, these people are actually sitting down, bringing all this demonic, diabolic stuff, and making it sound like science.
[01:54:05.097 --> 01:54:06.518]  So it's no longer a rabbit hole.
[01:54:06.558 --> 01:54:10.081]  It's no longer what they call a conspiracy theory.
[01:54:10.441 --> 01:54:12.022]  It is actually what they are saying.
[01:54:12.549 --> 01:54:30.075]  So if you take that backdrop and Charles Morgan saying that, that they cannot actually put electrodes in the heads of people like you'll put electrodes in the heads of rats, but they can program a cell to go to your brain, to go to your hippocampus.
[01:54:30.635 --> 01:54:36.557]  So I do believe that this vaccine, especially since they coated this vaccine in a lipid,
[01:54:37.355 --> 01:54:44.880]  When you caught something in lipid, you want it to cross the blood-brain barrier, which is probably the reason why a lot of people that are taking this vaccine are getting neurological symptoms.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:53.245]  This whole thing is the delivery system that they want to go into your brain so that when they are good and ready, they can control all of you.
[01:54:53.305 --> 01:54:57.408]  And let me just pause you right there to put a little anecdote in here because this is so key.
[01:54:58.248 --> 01:55:03.472]  This is the case with all vaccines and the reason why, and we have this data, the reason why
[01:55:04.312 --> 01:55:17.638]  With babies, specifically boys that get vaccinated compared to girls, the reason why you see more autism or vaccine side effects in boys is because their blood-brain barrier is nowhere near as thick as girls.
[01:55:17.918 --> 01:55:23.841]  And so that's why you see autism and all the side effects from vaccines and more boys getting autism than girls.
[01:55:23.901 --> 01:55:26.822]  It's not even close because the blood-brain barrier is thinner
[01:55:27.122 --> 01:55:32.627]  So that vaccine can penetrate and get in and do the brain damage, neurological damage to boys easier than it can girls.
[01:55:32.827 --> 01:55:36.210]  But now it looks like they're going after the girls' reproductive system with this new one.
[01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:37.211]  But I digress.
[01:55:38.312 --> 01:55:38.552]  Yes.
[01:55:39.353 --> 01:55:39.914]  So it's good.
[01:55:39.954 --> 01:55:44.638]  So this is what, this whole thing, COVID was, let me tell you something, COVID always had a treatment.
[01:55:44.678 --> 01:55:46.099]  COVID is completely treatable.
[01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:47.981]  COVID is completely preventable.
[01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:50.243]  In fact, let me digress a little bit and say this.
[01:55:50.323 --> 01:55:52.385]  Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[01:55:52.873 --> 01:56:00.117]  And everybody listening to me, while we resist, while we're standing and fighting, please get prevention.
[01:56:00.598 --> 01:56:12.485]  Get hydroxychloroquine, get ivermectin, take it weekly, Sunday-Sunday medicine, because people go on all these tours and they go on all these protests, and then they come back and they get sick and then they can't breathe.
[01:56:12.785 --> 01:56:14.166]  This is an invisible enemy.
[01:56:14.246 --> 01:56:15.086]  I do believe that.
[01:56:15.427 --> 01:56:17.508]  This thing was, I mean, recently,
[01:56:18.055 --> 01:56:24.977]  The Congress, they are actually going after the Senate, going after Anthony Fauci for gain-of-function studies on this virus.
[01:56:25.437 --> 01:56:27.097]  How come nobody's upset with China?
[01:56:27.437 --> 01:56:42.601]  Because actually it's our military that took this thing to China, to that lab, to give it gain-of-function, so that they can release it all over the world, scare people to death, and then allow people to die, and then they can have a chance for the Great Reset.
[01:56:43.359 --> 01:56:44.119]  Think about it.
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:47.241]  The great research, they say we will own nothing and we'll be happy.
[01:56:47.701 --> 01:56:48.442]  What's going to happen?
[01:56:48.462 --> 01:56:51.783]  Somebody's going to program it in my head that I'm happy even though I own nothing?
[01:56:51.984 --> 01:57:08.372]  Well, and just imagine the madness of this too, Dr. Emanuel, where it was under the Obama administration, the controversial research into gain-of-function was too controversial, so it had to be shut down in the North Carolina lab, and so they just said, oh, well, we'll just move it to China.
[01:57:08.572 --> 01:57:09.333]  I mean, imagine
[01:57:09.913 --> 01:57:20.961]  Let's say you had the Manhattan Experiment building nuclear weapons, or atom bombs, and they say, oh, this is not good, we don't want to build atom bombs, and they said, okay, let's give that research to China.
[01:57:21.821 --> 01:57:22.101]  What?
[01:57:22.522 --> 01:57:23.682]  That's what they did with COVID!
[01:57:25.023 --> 01:57:25.984]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:57:26.324 --> 01:57:29.446]  And that is why you don't see anybody really upset with China, because they can't.
[01:57:29.726 --> 01:57:33.069]  They can't be upset with China, because they know that they took that technology to China.
[01:57:33.429 --> 01:57:37.452]  And now China has that leverage over us too, to say, actually, this came from you.
[01:57:38.803 --> 01:57:41.642]  Yes, China has said it, that the military brought it over there.
[01:57:42.199 --> 01:57:45.862]  You know, so now imagine DARPA that is making our vaccines.
[01:57:46.322 --> 01:57:58.492]  It's the same DARPA where all these professors that are working, that are talking about this Human 2.0 and talking about changing our mind, talking about, you know, I mean, Professor Cruz worked in DARPA for five years.
[01:57:58.512 --> 01:57:59.613]  He was a program developer.
[01:57:59.813 --> 01:58:03.536]  Then when she went from a program developer, right now, she's at the Platypus Institute.
[01:58:03.677 --> 01:58:06.879]  Everybody go and Google the Platypus Institute.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:09.621]  Listen to the owner, listen to the founder.
[01:58:10.583 --> 01:58:12.524]  He himself sounds like a computer, like a 2.0.
[01:58:13.725 --> 01:58:18.309]  And the way he said he came about it, actually came about it, he went some rabbit holes.
[01:58:18.889 --> 01:58:21.951]  This is the thing that I'm trying to get across to human beings.
[01:58:23.212 --> 01:58:27.656]  All this stuff that they are making it sound like science is actually just demonic technology.
[01:58:27.916 --> 01:58:28.536]  It's just a devil.
[01:58:28.916 --> 01:58:30.838]  It's just that they are making it sound as if it's science.
[01:58:31.311 --> 01:58:38.816]  And like I talk about all these human beings like Bill Gates them or Fauci them that are going to go network with the devil thinking that he's going to give them eternal life.
[01:58:39.156 --> 01:58:41.057]  The devil can't give them something he doesn't have.
[01:58:41.357 --> 01:58:42.938]  They're just useful idiots.
[01:58:43.119 --> 01:58:43.519]  All of them.
[01:58:43.799 --> 01:58:45.560]  Bill Gates, all these globalists.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:53.986]  If you're human and you're going to think that they're going to make you wireless, the internet of things and you're going to live forever, you're just a useful idiot.
[01:58:54.326 --> 01:58:56.387]  The devil cannot give you life.
[01:58:56.467 --> 01:58:57.188]  He doesn't have it.
[01:58:57.388 --> 01:58:58.929]  He's going to take you with him to the lake of fire.
[01:58:59.529 --> 01:59:01.450]  This battle is already won.
[01:59:01.931 --> 01:59:03.052]  Everybody read Revelation.
[01:59:03.172 --> 01:59:04.332]  The battle is won already.
[01:59:04.713 --> 01:59:07.795]  So, no matter what they are saying, we know the end of the battle already.
[01:59:08.055 --> 01:59:09.356]  So they can try all they want.
[01:59:09.376 --> 01:59:12.158]  The devil tried this in the days of Nimrod.
[01:59:12.458 --> 01:59:17.581]  Tried to bring everybody together to have one mind and decide that, oh, they are going to reach heaven by themselves.
[01:59:17.941 --> 01:59:21.044]  At the end of the day, in the days of Nimrod, God came and destroyed it.
[01:59:21.424 --> 01:59:24.346]  And this time around, God is going to come down and scatter all of this.
[01:59:25.106 --> 01:59:27.648]  The end of the story is already written.
[01:59:28.066 --> 01:59:29.006]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:59:29.026 --> 01:59:30.287]  So it's just really stupid.
[01:59:30.467 --> 01:59:34.808]  You know, all these Bill Gates and all these globalists, they're just useful idiots.
[01:59:35.428 --> 01:59:38.029]  How can you allow the enemy of your soul to deceive you?
[01:59:39.069 --> 01:59:41.110]  I hear that there are people that have died.
[01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:46.791]  While they were dying, they said, embalm my body so that when this technology comes out, we're going to erase you again.
[01:59:46.811 --> 01:59:47.732]  No, they're not going to erase you.
[01:59:47.752 --> 01:59:48.712]  You're going to be dead.
[01:59:48.892 --> 01:59:49.652]  D-E-A-D.
[01:59:49.952 --> 01:59:50.732]  Dead and buried.
[01:59:50.993 --> 01:59:52.053]  Your body's going to be here.
[01:59:52.173 --> 01:59:55.454]  They might erase you, but you'll be a demon that's going to be operating in your body.
[01:59:55.474 --> 01:59:55.974]  You'll be gone.
[01:59:56.624 --> 02:00:01.210]  They even have what, I don't know what I, you know, they even have an institute that actually clones people.
[02:00:01.490 --> 02:00:02.151]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:00:02.592 --> 02:00:03.333]  This thing, cloning.
[02:00:14.887 --> 02:00:15.887]  We'll be right back.
[02:00:35.558 --> 02:00:38.979]  This has been an incredible interview with Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[02:00:39.039 --> 02:00:44.401]  Remember, this entire thing is going to be posted at band.video, bandthis.tv.
[02:00:45.282 --> 02:00:46.542]  And it's free to air, folks.
[02:00:46.602 --> 02:00:48.763]  You can download it right there at the source.
[02:00:48.903 --> 02:00:53.445]  You can edit it, re-upload it, cut it up however you want, share it with friends and family.
[02:00:53.525 --> 02:00:56.446]  The entire interview is going to be at band.video.
[02:00:56.586 --> 02:01:01.348]  And remember to check out Dr. Stella Emanuel's Rumble channel as well.
[02:01:01.908 --> 02:01:03.689]  And so we're in the final segment here.
[02:01:04.744 --> 02:01:10.909]  And I want to wrap it up, but you know, it's incredible listening to you and having some of the dots connected in my head too.
[02:01:10.929 --> 02:01:16.513]  And I think this is a story that is ahead of its time, but we'll break it right now like we always do.
[02:01:16.553 --> 02:01:19.295]  And I think people will probably catch on to this maybe in a month or a year.
[02:01:20.933 --> 02:01:35.209]  Basically, what has happened here, either wittingly or unwittingly, is that Anthony Fauci and Barack Obama moved a bioweapon and gave it to China, which has ultimately been used against us.
[02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:39.994]  I mean, folks, imagine if they sold the Manhattan Project
[02:01:40.735 --> 02:01:47.063]  I mean, that's basically the equivalent of what they've done.
[02:01:47.864 --> 02:01:52.970]  And this story is probably a little ahead of its time right now, but I have a feeling this is going to be caught on eventually.
[02:01:53.590 --> 02:01:58.096]  But my question for Dr. Stella Emanuel now, as we're in the final segment with her.
[02:02:00.106 --> 02:02:28.658]  I'm not sure if you're aware, we showed some of the videos there, but what do you make of, let's get into the vaccine now, what do you make of the fact it's being forced, the fact that people get the vaccine still don't feel safe, the fact the media is saying safe and effective even though they're admitting it's not effective because they still have to wear the mask, they still are in fear, and I guess they're admitting it's not safe because we know about all the side effects that are being reported even in the mainstream media now.
[02:02:29.338 --> 02:02:35.764]  But what about this crazy phenomenon of people who have been vaccinated having their arm magnetized?
[02:02:36.424 --> 02:02:37.405]  You've seen this now.
[02:02:37.505 --> 02:02:39.107]  What are your thoughts on that?
[02:02:40.468 --> 02:02:43.831]  I actually believe that is actually part of the technology that we put in people.
[02:02:44.272 --> 02:02:50.878]  You see, one of the things I've been talking to doctors and all of us that are fighting this battle, this is a spiritual battle.
[02:02:51.198 --> 02:02:53.180]  And a lot of people are just fighting it in this physical.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:55.502]  A lot of these globalists, they are Luciferians.
[02:02:56.132 --> 02:02:57.833]  All they want to do is control human beings.
[02:02:58.133 --> 02:02:59.454]  Everybody has their own agenda.
[02:02:59.654 --> 02:03:08.780]  People like Bill Gates want to kill a whole bunch of people, but at the end of the thing, it is actually the devil that wants to corrupt humanity like they did in the days of Genesis.
[02:03:09.301 --> 02:03:12.943]  So, if they want 7 billion people vaccinated,
[02:03:13.303 --> 02:03:16.684]  Because to me, it doesn't make sense why they are vaccinating children when they don't get COVID.
[02:03:17.045 --> 02:03:23.087]  So it doesn't matter what is going on, the propaganda, everything that is going on, they want 7 billion people vaccinated.
[02:03:23.447 --> 02:03:25.168]  This whole COVID did not have to happen.
[02:03:25.488 --> 02:03:27.009]  COVID was made for the vaccine.
[02:03:27.269 --> 02:03:35.032]  COVID was made so that we can bring the vaccine, put this nanotechnology in our brain, so that we can be able to connect every one of us to the Internet of Things.
[02:03:35.792 --> 02:03:37.213]  Watch Dr. Cruz's video.
[02:03:37.513 --> 02:03:39.013]  Watch Charles Morgan's video.
[02:03:39.273 --> 02:03:40.394]  Everything will come together.
[02:03:40.854 --> 02:03:42.814]  So yes, there's some technology in there.
[02:03:43.275 --> 02:03:43.995]  But this is the thing.
[02:03:44.095 --> 02:03:45.615]  It is not human technology.
[02:03:45.655 --> 02:03:46.896]  It's Luciferian technology.
[02:03:47.196 --> 02:03:48.296]  Have you heard about CRISPR?
[02:03:48.496 --> 02:03:49.697]  Where they can splice genes.
[02:03:49.717 --> 02:03:50.817]  This thing happened in 2008.
[02:03:51.397 --> 02:03:52.898]  All this technology is so fast.
[02:03:53.178 --> 02:03:55.378]  They can cut your gene, splice it, attach more.
[02:03:55.599 --> 02:03:58.199]  They can edit a child in this womb.
[02:03:58.219 --> 02:03:59.280]  They can edit people.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:03:59.940]  Do you hear what I'm saying?
[02:04:00.456 --> 02:04:01.978]  This stuff is demonic.
[02:04:02.338 --> 02:04:06.762]  The devil wants us to be human 2.0 so that we're not going to be human anymore.
[02:04:06.782 --> 02:04:12.848]  If you read in Revelation, when they talk about the mark of the beast, when you're not human anymore, you cannot be saved.
[02:04:13.068 --> 02:04:17.552]  So that is what this whole thing is about Lucifer and the bottom line of it is Lucifer.
[02:04:17.833 --> 02:04:19.874]  Even the human beings that are walking with him, they are stupid.
[02:04:20.455 --> 02:04:21.236]  But here is the thing.
[02:04:22.617 --> 02:04:26.981]  If they get everybody vaxxed, then they have this technology in all of our heads.
[02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:29.162]  They can control us on a computer.
[02:04:29.443 --> 02:04:32.946]  When you watch Charles Morgan, he will tell you how it's like a possession experiment.
[02:04:34.127 --> 02:04:37.750]  I'm telling you, this whole pandemic was just a fake.
[02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:41.132]  It was all about getting everybody vaccinated.
[02:04:41.433 --> 02:04:43.214]  People are like, well, can't they use it with the flu?
[02:04:43.574 --> 02:04:44.655]  People don't take the flu shot.
[02:04:45.136 --> 02:04:46.357]  Adults don't take vaccines.
[02:04:46.637 --> 02:04:49.980]  They have to bring a pandemic, scare everybody, then get everybody vaccinated.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:51.581]  So this is the issue.
[02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:56.813]  If you've been vaccinated, in fact, the Moderna vaccine was made with a lipid probe.
[02:04:56.853 --> 02:05:01.254]  The lipid nanoparticle used in the Moderna vaccine is Luciferase.
[02:05:01.674 --> 02:05:08.857]  If you go and follow it up, they actually, if they put, take the lipid nanoparticle, I think they take it and just Google it, you'll find out.
[02:05:08.917 --> 02:05:11.178]  The lipid nanoparticle is Luciferase.
[02:05:11.478 --> 02:05:14.619]  Luciferase is Lucifer, the bearer of light.
[02:05:14.879 --> 02:05:17.260]  So at the end of the day, it's all about corrupting humanity.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.702]  Changing us to cyborgs or centaurs.
[02:05:20.042 --> 02:05:23.024]  If you listen to Dr. Cruz, everybody needs to become a centaur.
[02:05:23.064 --> 02:05:25.426]  Everybody needs to upgrade our brains.
[02:05:25.746 --> 02:05:27.608]  Who told them that I want my brain upgraded?
[02:05:27.748 --> 02:05:28.428]  I'm a human being.
[02:05:28.728 --> 02:05:30.730]  I'm sure you guys are computer, but keep your computers.
[02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:31.831]  I want to be a human being.
[02:05:32.511 --> 02:05:34.172]  So this is what is going on.
[02:05:34.232 --> 02:05:36.054]  That is the whole thing about this vaccine.
[02:05:36.681 --> 02:05:37.061]  I don't think so.
[02:05:55.738 --> 02:06:00.500]  For everybody that has taken this vaccine, some of people, your life might be in danger.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:05.182]  I would expect everyone, if you've taken the vaccine, get on hydroxychloroquine, it is anti-inflammatory.
[02:06:05.502 --> 02:06:11.824]  Get on ivermectin because we've had people take the vaccine, they get sick, they come back to us, we treat them and they still get well.
[02:06:12.064 --> 02:06:13.725]  Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin works.
[02:06:14.145 --> 02:06:16.507]  In all the different strains, it works.
[02:06:16.847 --> 02:06:22.692]  So if you go to DrStellaMD.com, you can get prophylaxis for hydroxychloroquine, you can get prophylaxis for ivermectin.
[02:06:22.992 --> 02:06:25.514]  If you've taken the vaccine, get on prophylaxis.
[02:06:25.774 --> 02:06:26.875]  Keep your vitamin D up.
[02:06:27.295 --> 02:06:29.057]  But this is what God has been showing me.
[02:06:29.257 --> 02:06:31.258]  In the book of Psalms, chapter 18, verse 42-43,
[02:06:34.981 --> 02:06:39.066]  It says strangers would submit and they'll be afraid out of their close places.
[02:06:39.547 --> 02:06:47.777]  As long as this is a Luciferian technology, it's a demonic spirit, it can be cast out the same way any other demon is casted out.
[02:06:48.097 --> 02:06:48.598]  And guess what?
[02:06:48.898 --> 02:06:49.900]  We're demon busters.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.942]  We prayed for a lady that took the vaccine.
[02:06:52.202 --> 02:06:53.384]  The place started vibrating.
[02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:55.871]  It was vibrating as we continue to pray.
[02:06:56.192 --> 02:06:58.593]  She saw an L-shaped chip leave her body.
[02:06:59.034 --> 02:07:01.415]  So if you've been vaccinated, all is not lost.
[02:07:01.635 --> 02:07:02.776]  Number one, repent.
[02:07:03.116 --> 02:07:04.097]  Ask God to forgive you.
[02:07:04.557 --> 02:07:10.582]  Ask for the blood of Jesus to redeem you just the same way that he redeemed us from the Adamic nature.
[02:07:11.022 --> 02:07:16.086]  Ask for the blood to redeem you and then pray and command those strangers to come out of your body.
[02:07:16.526 --> 02:07:17.827]  We do prayer every day.
[02:07:17.867 --> 02:07:22.470]  We do prayer every day and we're about to open the ranch where it's going to be a place of prayer.
[02:07:22.730 --> 02:07:24.791]  If you need deliverance, contact our ministry.
[02:07:27.313 --> 02:07:33.179]  We're going to hook you up and put you through deliverance and this demonic, diabolic thing will get out of your body.
[02:07:33.439 --> 02:07:34.680]  The devil is a liar.
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:35.901]  He cannot succeed.
[02:07:36.161 --> 02:07:37.242]  He will not succeed.
[02:07:37.643 --> 02:07:43.428]  So, because it's demonic, because it's Luciferian, the blood of Jesus, the name of Jesus will cast it out.
[02:07:43.888 --> 02:07:45.009]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[02:07:45.029 --> 02:07:45.870]  So, there is hope.
[02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.971]  Just repent.
[02:07:47.391 --> 02:07:48.132]  Ask for deliverance.
[02:07:48.352 --> 02:07:49.213]  Ask for God to do it.
[02:07:49.573 --> 02:07:53.457]  And Christians, pastors, pray for people to cast this thing out of their bodies.
[02:07:54.562 --> 02:07:56.042]  This is not the mark yet.
[02:07:56.363 --> 02:08:03.624]  They just want to program your mind so that in the days of the mark, they will just program into your head that the devil is God and you'll believe it.
[02:08:04.084 --> 02:08:05.264]  But it will not happen.
[02:08:05.525 --> 02:08:06.965]  We already know the end of the story.
[02:08:07.265 --> 02:08:08.085]  Jesus wins.
[02:08:09.225 --> 02:08:10.686]  And I would like to pray before we go.
[02:08:12.066 --> 02:08:16.427]  Father, in the name of Jesus, I thank you for every person listening to the sound of my voice.
[02:08:17.051 --> 02:08:21.275]  Father God, your mercy and grace will be released upon this nation.
[02:08:21.616 --> 02:08:28.683]  I command every mind blindness, every mind manipulation, every bewitchment over the minds of the people.
[02:08:29.003 --> 02:08:32.547]  I command it to break right now in the name of Jesus.
[02:08:32.627 --> 02:08:36.191]  Father, I bring repentance on behalf of the people that have been
[02:08:36.431 --> 02:08:38.552]  Are you fearful enough to take this vaccine?
[02:08:38.772 --> 02:08:47.358]  Let the blood of Jesus, the blood that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel, begin to speak on behalf of everyone listening to the sound of my voice.
[02:08:47.378 --> 02:08:53.401]  Let the veil of darkness upon your mind be torn right now in the name of Jesus.
[02:08:53.522 --> 02:09:03.087]  I command that stranger, that Luciferian deposit, that demonic, diabolic, Luciferian deposit to begin to come out of your body in the name of
[02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:06.449]  We're good to go.
[02:09:25.916 --> 02:09:32.461]  Go deep into your genetic material and begin to repair every genetic corruption in the name of Jesus.
[02:09:32.601 --> 02:09:35.603]  Father, arise, O God, and save your people.
[02:09:35.703 --> 02:09:44.029]  Arise, Father, and contend with those that are contending with us, and judge these demonic, diabolic creatures in the name of Jesus.
[02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:55.457]  We cast them into the pit where they belong in the name of Jesus, and we cover this nation with the glory of God, and let the revival fire of God come forth in this nation in Jesus' name.
[02:09:55.737 --> 02:09:56.297]  Hallelujah.
[02:09:57.738 --> 02:09:58.138]  Amen.
[02:09:58.198 --> 02:10:02.660]  Go to DrSaraMD.com, get prophylaxis, get treated.
[02:10:03.221 --> 02:10:04.942]  If you need deliverance, contact us.
[02:10:06.102 --> 02:10:07.223]  We're going to fight this battle.
[02:10:07.243 --> 02:10:07.983]  We're going to win.
[02:10:08.303 --> 02:10:09.224]  Jesus is going to win.
[02:10:09.464 --> 02:10:09.724]  Thank you.
[02:10:10.882 --> 02:10:13.705]  Thank you so much, Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[02:10:13.745 --> 02:10:18.189]  This has been a powerful hour, and of course, ladies and gentlemen, remember Band.Video.
[02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:22.193]  You can download this whole thing, edit it up how you want, share it with your friends and family.
[02:10:22.994 --> 02:10:28.280]  This is the information that the corporate establishment, the corrupt corporate establishment,
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.603]  And their cronies in the government don't want you to have access to.
[02:10:31.643 --> 02:10:33.024]  That's why we're being banned.
[02:10:33.084 --> 02:10:35.306]  That's why they're banning Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[02:10:35.346 --> 02:10:35.966]  Just incredible.
[02:10:36.007 --> 02:10:37.788]  Trying to silence doctors for telling the truth.
[02:10:38.148 --> 02:10:40.911]  Once again, Dr. Stella Emanuel, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:10:43.793 --> 02:10:46.075]  So there she goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:46.115 --> 02:10:46.376]  Wow.
[02:10:48.518 --> 02:10:52.061]  Folks, now you know your job.
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.842]  Be the modern-day Paul Reveres.
[02:10:55.822 --> 02:10:56.803]  Take this interview.
[02:10:56.923 --> 02:10:57.344]  Share it.
[02:10:57.504 --> 02:10:58.805]  Spread it far and wide.
[02:10:58.965 --> 02:11:00.206]  Put it on your social media.
[02:11:00.266 --> 02:11:01.107]  Put it on email.
[02:11:01.127 --> 02:11:02.288]  Send it out in text threads.
[02:11:02.348 --> 02:11:05.431]  Tell everybody about this great doctor warning the world.
[02:11:06.332 --> 02:11:06.772]  All right!
[02:11:07.847 --> 02:11:09.928]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a special report coming up.
[02:11:09.988 --> 02:11:12.509]  Well, actually, multiple special reports from Alex Jones.
[02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:17.151]  An unseen interview with Larry Pinckney, one of the original founders of the Black Panthers.
[02:11:17.592 --> 02:11:20.013]  I'll be back hosting the InfoWars War Room coming up at 3.
[02:11:20.653 --> 02:11:24.615]  Before I depart, though, ladies and gentlemen, that interview was incredible.
[02:11:26.236 --> 02:11:26.496]  Wow.
[02:11:27.276 --> 02:11:31.298]  And now, the duty is yours to make sure it gets a million views.
[02:11:33.339 --> 02:11:36.220]  That's how many views that interview needs.
[02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:36.960]  It's a million views.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:37.600]  Minimum.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:39.421]  Should be a hundred million.
[02:11:41.861 --> 02:11:48.283]  But the dog only hunts if you put it into the field.
[02:11:49.723 --> 02:11:54.125]  So once we get that video up, the Bandot video, we're going to get it up as soon as possible.
[02:11:54.165 --> 02:11:55.085]  I've got to think of a title.
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:12:01.082]  We'll get it up in its entirety, then you download it, you can post it to your own platforms, we don't care.
[02:12:01.203 --> 02:12:04.804]  Edit it, you know, edit the parts you like out the most and put them up if you want.
[02:12:06.105 --> 02:12:10.667]  Share the links, tell your friends and family, we need to have a million eyes and ears on that interview.
[02:12:12.068 --> 02:12:18.912]  Wow, and so now my final challenge is to come up with the right headline to get that to happen.
[02:12:19.812 --> 02:12:21.253]  And again, it cannot be
[02:12:23.533 --> 02:12:28.415]  Forgotten, this wouldn't even be possible without you and the audience's financial support.
[02:12:28.455 --> 02:12:42.182]  So not only do we need your support of being the modern-day Paul Reveres of spreading the information, doing your midnight ride, your digital ride, we also need your financial support so that we can have the studios and so we can have the platforms and we can facilitate all of this.

[02:13:19.646 --> 02:13:28.412]  Now, boy oh boy, how much news can I get to in a two-minute time span here?
[02:13:31.530 --> 02:13:34.353]  You know, Vernon Jones doesn't get enough positive attention.
[02:13:34.734 --> 02:13:41.902]  This guy, I mean, Matt Gaetz gets a lot of attention, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Ron DeSantis, and they're all great.
[02:13:42.663 --> 02:13:44.585]  Vernon Jones is right up there, right now.
[02:13:45.569 --> 02:13:47.370]  And former Democrat, now Republican.
[02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:51.552]  This guy needs a lot more accolades.
[02:13:52.273 --> 02:13:56.555]  I don't know if I'm the first to suggest, but how about a Vernon Jones runs for president?
[02:13:57.175 --> 02:13:58.796]  How about a Trump Jones ticket?
[02:13:59.797 --> 02:14:01.217]  Not Alex Jones, Vernon Jones.
[02:14:01.398 --> 02:14:03.279]  Seriously, Vernon Jones is the real deal, folks.
[02:14:04.239 --> 02:14:05.540]  And he had an event today.
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:10.362]  Guys, will you see if there's any updates on his event today at Liberty Plaza in Atlanta?
[02:14:10.422 --> 02:14:12.803]  Vernon Jones schedules press conference for today.
[02:14:12.863 --> 02:14:14.404]  This is a story from last night.
[02:14:15.305 --> 02:14:19.767]  For today in Atlanta to call for a full forensic audit of Georgia's 2020 election results.
[02:14:20.687 --> 02:14:21.568]  Bingo!
[02:14:22.668 --> 02:14:23.229]  Yahtzee!
[02:14:25.049 --> 02:14:26.429]  Yeah, let's get the audits going.
[02:14:26.569 --> 02:14:37.612]  Let's continue, because what we're finding is mass voter fraud, but more so mass criminal cover-up of these investigations, of these audits by the Democrats.
[02:14:37.892 --> 02:14:43.414]  For example, information deleted from Maricopa County election machine has been recovered.
[02:14:43.434 --> 02:14:48.475]  Remember, they tried to delete that data so that the audit couldn't find how the election was stolen in Maricopa County.
[02:14:48.635 --> 02:14:50.236]  Oops, looks like they found the data.
[02:14:50.256 --> 02:14:50.556]  Uh-oh.
[02:14:50.836 --> 02:14:50.936]  Ooh.
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:15:00.922]  Fake President Joe Biden driving around, or faking like he's pretending to drive around in an electric car that someone else was driving for him, not even kidding.
[02:15:00.942 --> 02:15:03.223]  It's how big of a joke this all is now.
[02:15:03.823 --> 02:15:07.885]  But he's wearing aviator sunglasses and groping babies, so he's cool.
[02:15:08.945 --> 02:15:16.667]  And then this is, I'm telling you man, this Bill Gates-Epstein thing, this has the potential to blow a lot of things wide open.
[02:15:17.508 --> 02:15:21.129]  Bill Gates reportedly hoped Jeffrey Epstein would help him win a Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:15:22.051 --> 02:15:25.093]  Is that for the work that Gates was doing with Epstein in New Mexico?
[02:15:25.173 --> 02:15:25.894]  Cloning people?
[02:15:25.954 --> 02:15:29.236]  I mean... It's funny how we just ignore that story, isn't it?
[02:15:31.257 --> 02:15:32.018]  Certainly is.
[02:15:32.098 --> 02:15:32.458]  Alright!
[02:15:33.238 --> 02:15:33.879]  I sign off.
[02:15:33.899 --> 02:15:37.681]  Darren McBreen, Larry Pinkney, Alex Jones, take us the rest of the way.
[02:15:37.741 --> 02:15:39.723]  I'll be back hosting the War Room in an hour.
[02:15:46.147 --> 02:15:52.871]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:15:53.092 --> 02:15:55.253]  You better believe you got one!
[02:15:57.394 --> 02:16:02.638]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:31.071]  Anytime you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election time, and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you're not only a chump, but you're a traitor to your race.
[02:16:35.129 --> 02:16:37.150]  A Dixocrat is nothing but a Democrat.
[02:16:37.850 --> 02:16:41.611]  Whoever runs the Democrats is also the father of the Dixocrats.
[02:16:42.171 --> 02:16:46.933]  And the father of all of them is sitting in the White House.
[02:16:47.833 --> 02:16:54.036]  And those were powerful words of wisdom from Malcolm X. He called the Democrats Dixocrats.
[02:16:54.476 --> 02:16:55.956]  Larry Pinkney joins us now.
[02:16:56.116 --> 02:16:57.577]  Larry, I wanted to get your take on that.
[02:16:57.837 --> 02:17:00.678]  What do you suppose Malcolm meant by Dixocrats?
[02:17:01.547 --> 02:17:15.761]  Well, Malcolm was referring specifically to the fact that the Democrat Party is not only hypocritical, but was the, and still is, but the most fundamentally racist party
[02:17:16.354 --> 02:17:17.595]  People don't realize that.
[02:17:18.015 --> 02:17:23.260]  The Democrats built their party on racism, okay?
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.264]  And people think that, oh my, the Democrats, they're so wonderful.
[02:17:28.324 --> 02:17:35.270]  The reality is that the Democrats are probably the biggest devils of the two parties.
[02:17:35.650 --> 02:17:40.855]  It's no doubt that the Democrats have shown repeatedly that they cannot be trusted.
[02:17:41.395 --> 02:17:44.718]  Okay, and I'm talking about primarily their leadership.
[02:17:44.759 --> 02:17:53.367]  So when Malcolm, Brother Malcolm, referred to them as Dixiecrats, he was talking about their fundamental racism.
[02:17:53.587 --> 02:17:59.473]  And they are still, no matter what their symbolism is, they are still fundamentally racist.
[02:18:00.069 --> 02:18:12.138]  I think my favorite quote from Malcolm X was something he said about the mainstream news media, and I mean he nailed it, when he said that the media is the most powerful entity on earth.
[02:18:12.598 --> 02:18:17.182]  They have the power to make the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.
[02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:30.049]  And he also said, if you are not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.
[02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:34.772]  And that brings me to today's progressive liberal Democrats.
[02:18:35.373 --> 02:18:38.975]  What do you think Malcolm X would say about Black Lives Matter?
[02:18:39.793 --> 02:18:41.094]  Well, oh my God.
[02:18:41.874 --> 02:18:59.125]  You know, Malcolm, and when I met Malcolm and spoke with him, one thing that was crystal clear to me was that Brother Malcolm was a strong believer in family values, traditional family, okay, what we call the nuclear family.
[02:18:59.765 --> 02:19:00.826]  Black Lives Matter is
[02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:09.258]  I'm sure Malcolm would see the hypocrisy of Black Lives Matter.
[02:19:09.979 --> 02:19:21.353]  I'm sure that Malcolm would know that Black Lives Matter, their so-called leadership, okay, opposes the traditional family values.
[02:19:21.413 --> 02:19:22.515]  They oppose
[02:19:23.135 --> 02:19:35.823]  Okay, the nuclear family and by the way, you know that they made it clear themselves in their original manifesto It says it in their mission statement their mission statement on their website.
[02:19:35.883 --> 02:19:36.603]  It's still up there.
[02:19:36.643 --> 02:19:39.165]  They want to break up the nuclear family
[02:19:39.921 --> 02:19:40.461]  Exactly.
[02:19:40.701 --> 02:19:51.707]  So when you break up the nuclear family, in essence what you're doing is you are destroying, first of all, the family, but you destroy the family, you destroy the nation.
[02:19:52.507 --> 02:19:53.848]  Let's be clear about that.
[02:19:54.188 --> 02:19:55.008]  And they know that.
[02:19:55.348 --> 02:19:56.369]  They're not stupid.
[02:19:56.729 --> 02:19:58.270]  They know what they're doing.
[02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:15.173]  So, you know, this is, I wish people, so many people, and I think they have good, when I say they, I'm not talking about the leadership, there are people who caught up with Black Lives Matter who have no clue as to who and what they really are.
[02:20:15.433 --> 02:20:16.554]  They're treacherous!
[02:20:16.954 --> 02:20:17.894]  They're treacherous!
[02:20:18.154 --> 02:20:21.955]  And I'm sure Brother Malcolm would have seen that.
[02:20:22.075 --> 02:20:23.415]  I have no doubt about that.
[02:20:24.406 --> 02:20:28.351]  All right, I want to play you another clip, and I think you'll recognize this guy.
[02:20:28.391 --> 02:20:35.498]  This is another warning from the past on what fascism will look like in America.
[02:20:36.059 --> 02:20:36.359]  Roll it.
[02:20:38.222 --> 02:20:44.669]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:20:46.812 --> 02:20:47.193]  Isn't it?
[02:20:47.453 --> 02:20:57.932]  I mean, the fact is, is that I refer to the Democrats primarily, I call them neoliberal fascists.
[02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:58.890]  Why?
[02:20:59.370 --> 02:21:06.094]  Because they neo, new, liberal, they call themselves fascists, they definitely are, okay?
[02:21:06.274 --> 02:21:08.175]  In particular, their leadership.
[02:21:08.535 --> 02:21:12.537]  So, Reagan was correct, I have to say, he was correct.
[02:21:12.937 --> 02:21:20.801]  This is how they're trying to bring fascism in, and they call everybody else what they themselves
[02:21:21.602 --> 02:21:34.094]  Okay, so they are the fascists, they are the racists, they are the ones who are facilitating and perpetuating and perpetuating this situation.
[02:21:34.434 --> 02:21:35.615]  So you know what?
[02:21:35.915 --> 02:21:36.856]  Reagan was correct.
[02:21:37.297 --> 02:21:45.645]  It's like he somehow saw the future because that's exactly what these neoliberal Democrats
[02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:47.513]  Fascist, okay?
[02:21:47.593 --> 02:21:49.816]  Neoliberal fascist Democrats.
[02:21:50.076 --> 02:21:51.999]  I hope people remember that expression.
[02:21:52.299 --> 02:21:56.285]  And I'm talking about their so-called leadership, which I call misleadership.
[02:21:56.545 --> 02:21:58.008]  But that's what I'm talking about.
[02:21:58.268 --> 02:21:59.590]  Their so-called leadership.
[02:22:00.106 --> 02:22:01.348]  Sorry I got on a rant.
[02:22:01.488 --> 02:22:14.022]  No, I love it and we don't want to let the establishment Republicans off the hook either because I mean really they're the same evil corrupt, part of the same evil corrupt system.
[02:22:14.543 --> 02:22:16.085]  The two-party system is a lie.
[02:22:16.545 --> 02:22:17.605]  Yeah, let's face it.
[02:22:17.885 --> 02:22:19.666]  We have a one-party system.
[02:22:19.766 --> 02:22:24.527]  It's the government party, or now we could even call it the one world government party.
[02:22:24.887 --> 02:22:28.328]  We've been taken over, by my opinion, by China, the UN.
[02:22:28.768 --> 02:22:31.368]  We no longer have fair elections.
[02:22:31.729 --> 02:22:33.449]  We don't have free speech.
[02:22:34.109 --> 02:22:41.871]  The media is state-run propaganda, and there's no freedom of the press, and our justice
[02:22:42.551 --> 02:22:45.073]  Well, I think that it's a failed state to the extent
[02:23:09.184 --> 02:23:24.908]  That the quote-unquote deep state, the neoliberal fascist Democrats and the RINO Republicans, to the extent that they are pushing to make this nation, this republic, a failed state.
[02:23:25.268 --> 02:23:26.608]  We've got to turn that around.
[02:23:27.128 --> 02:23:29.749]  We have to expose it for what it really is.
[02:23:30.129 --> 02:23:35.070]  But at this point in time, I have to say, yes, it is a failed state.
[02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:48.753]  Well I think it's safe to say that some people watching this broadcast for the first time tonight, we literally made their heads explode because first we played a clip from Malcolm X followed by a clip from Ronald Reagan.
[02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:51.113]  Both of them on the same side.
[02:23:51.593 --> 02:23:59.155]  Both of them unified in their warning about the impending liberal fascist takeover of America.
[02:23:59.475 --> 02:24:00.615]  That's why we call this
[02:24:01.255 --> 02:24:02.236]  An information war.
[02:24:02.617 --> 02:24:09.806]  That's why we are going against the mainstream, controlled narrative and telling it like it is.
[02:24:09.826 --> 02:24:13.350]  And as my good friend Larry Pinkney says, it is what it is.
[02:24:13.631 --> 02:24:14.772]  Larry, you have the last word.
[02:24:14.812 --> 02:24:15.914]  Tell us what you really think.
[02:24:17.221 --> 02:24:20.763]  What I really think is we'd better do something about this now.
[02:24:21.243 --> 02:24:24.285]  We'd better inform one another.
[02:24:24.845 --> 02:24:31.729]  I'm glad that people are looking at us and I hope they're critically thinking about what we are saying.
[02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:36.492]  We are at a turning point in our history.
[02:24:37.432 --> 02:24:40.074]  Are we going to be or are we not going to be?
[02:24:40.134 --> 02:24:41.154]  What's that expression?
[02:24:41.494 --> 02:24:43.055]  To be or not to be?
[02:24:43.595 --> 02:24:44.436]  That is the question.
[02:24:45.191 --> 02:24:47.332]  I say we must be a republic.
[02:24:47.992 --> 02:24:58.976]  We must stop being brainwashed and controlled by a propaganda machine that people have the unmitigated gall to call a news media.
[02:24:59.076 --> 02:25:00.057]  It's not a news media.
[02:25:00.137 --> 02:25:01.397]  It's a propaganda machine.
[02:25:01.837 --> 02:25:04.018]  So, that's what I want to say.
[02:25:04.338 --> 02:25:10.821]  Much love to all of you brothers and sisters, black, white, brown, red, yellow, US citizens of this republic.
[02:25:11.525 --> 02:25:12.946]  Let's keep on keeping on.
[02:25:13.146 --> 02:25:13.807]  Let's fight.
[02:25:14.207 --> 02:25:14.907]  Let's struggle.
[02:25:15.328 --> 02:25:17.609]  Let's get our Republic back.
[02:25:18.129 --> 02:25:18.630]  That's right.
[02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:20.111]  And the struggle continues.
[02:25:20.171 --> 02:25:20.851]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:25:20.871 --> 02:25:21.992]  We'll see you again next week.
[02:25:22.812 --> 02:25:23.673]  Thank you, brother.
[02:25:23.833 --> 02:25:24.354]  Love you, man.
[02:25:24.754 --> 02:25:24.934]  See you.
[02:25:36.107 --> 02:25:44.577]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:25:54.935 --> 02:26:05.864]  All right, I got Drew Mason on the show because he was happy to come down to Austin, Texas and be on air with us because he's a great, respected, trusted gold company, gold and silver.
[02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:14.111]  But now that he's here, and I'm glad he wants to get into this, he really wants to get into how this is a spiritual war.
[02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:17.191]  That's what we're going to be covering in the next three segments.
[02:26:17.471 --> 02:26:31.937]  And the globalists want to make fun of Christians, they want to make fun of people that have a relationship with God, not because they're really atheists, but because they understand the power of Christ and the power of God, and they're trying to block us from that so they can control us and dominate us.
[02:26:32.697 --> 02:26:34.940]  A lot of people tell me about the health effects of fasting.
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:42.171]  I've never really done it that much, but I've really been thinking about doing it lately, especially intermittent fasting or doing three-day fasts on just bread and water.
[02:26:42.291 --> 02:26:44.574]  And then I'm looking around for a great gold sponsor.
[02:26:44.594 --> 02:26:45.716]  I already know who this guy is.
[02:26:45.736 --> 02:26:46.537]  I've seen him on Fox News.
[02:26:46.557 --> 02:26:47.298]  I've seen him on Forbes.
[02:26:47.799 --> 02:26:50.542]  And he starts going, okay, we'll talk about selling gold and silver later.
[02:26:50.863 --> 02:26:53.586]  Let's talk about what the Bible says about fighting evil.
[02:26:53.626 --> 02:26:55.749]  So the left makes fun of this because they hate it.
[02:26:55.969 --> 02:26:58.572]  It's like Obama won't give a speech somewhere where a cross is.
[02:26:58.913 --> 02:26:59.954]  These people are really evil.
[02:26:59.994 --> 02:27:00.955]  So he's Drew Mason.
[02:27:01.335 --> 02:27:04.880]  He's the principal at stjosephpartners.com, infowarsgold.com.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:06.021]  We're good to go.
[02:27:24.918 --> 02:27:25.098]  Thank you.
[02:27:25.118 --> 02:27:29.220]  So, I would say, and this is a big statement, if Infowars are about the battle between good and evil,
[02:27:49.315 --> 02:27:52.596]  The ultimate Infowar could be about fasting.
[02:27:53.277 --> 02:27:54.777]  And I say that because, remember, St.
[02:27:54.817 --> 02:27:58.219]  Paul told us, don't wonder why things happen in the world.
[02:27:58.439 --> 02:28:02.520]  Everything happens because of the battle of principalities around us.
[02:28:03.501 --> 02:28:08.303]  So, if you start from that perspective, and then you begin drilling into Scripture,
[02:28:08.903 --> 02:28:28.156]  And the passage that we spoke about earlier, Mark 9, 29, and the parallel in Matthew, for literally millennia, Christ's words were specific, telling us when evil is at its most powerful, most intense, Christians can pray all day long, and they're going to lose every time.
[02:28:29.016 --> 02:28:32.280]  We saw it in Scripture with the guys that Christ hand-picked, hand-trained himself.
[02:28:33.021 --> 02:28:33.522]  They lost.
[02:28:34.123 --> 02:28:35.264]  And they said to him, why Lord?
[02:28:35.765 --> 02:28:38.608]  And because he said, this is a special case that requires prayer and fasting.
[02:28:38.649 --> 02:28:42.594]  So think about this from a war mentality, a military perspective.
[02:28:42.634 --> 02:28:43.435]  If you were evil,
[02:28:45.114 --> 02:28:46.475]  What would be the best thing you could do?
[02:28:46.975 --> 02:28:51.757]  It would be to destroy an awareness of how to defeat evil.
[02:28:52.877 --> 02:28:57.599]  And that is exactly what transpired with the rewritings of these scriptures.
[02:28:58.479 --> 02:29:02.781]  Christ's teaching there should have been titled, How to Defeat Evil.
[02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:08.063]  By removing it, we've now had an entire generation that's lost consciousness of how to do that.
[02:29:08.503 --> 02:29:12.685]  I think they may be putting up on the screens, you can see how these translations have changed in the 1960s.
[02:29:14.065 --> 02:29:17.206]  Now, let me go right to a question that some people are going to hear.
[02:29:17.226 --> 02:29:30.850]  They're going to say, well, the reason we took that word fasting out of the Bible is because in the 1960s, we found this manuscript and it didn't include the word fasting, and it was the oldest manuscript.
[02:29:31.630 --> 02:29:32.351]  Here's why.
[02:29:33.631 --> 02:29:36.192]  Recognize evil is never going to back down.
[02:29:36.252 --> 02:29:38.172]  It's never going to say, OK, you were right.
[02:29:38.232 --> 02:29:39.173]  You caught me.
[02:29:39.273 --> 02:29:40.013]  I was lying.
[02:29:40.593 --> 02:29:42.974]  It only is going to cede to power.
[02:29:44.485 --> 02:29:49.947]  So that statement that it was inaccurate to have fasting is a misrepresentation.
[02:29:50.707 --> 02:29:52.307]  We have thousands of manuscripts.
[02:29:53.148 --> 02:30:02.150]  The only two that don't include fasting were in pristine condition because believers in that day knew there was many things wrong with them.
[02:30:02.390 --> 02:30:03.231]  They never used them.
[02:30:03.871 --> 02:30:06.952]  The manuscripts that the early Christians were working with all said
[02:30:07.492 --> 02:30:07.992]  Fasting.
[02:30:08.313 --> 02:30:14.337]  But old and new husbands full of fasting and you have Jesus fasting for 40 days before, you know, Satan's gonna confront him.
[02:30:14.757 --> 02:30:15.518]  So that's there too.
[02:30:15.798 --> 02:30:16.819]  You're absolutely right.
[02:30:16.999 --> 02:30:22.043]  There are so many, yes, and that is a stinging defeat that Satan has never forgotten.
[02:30:22.683 --> 02:30:24.784]  That Christ fasted and it crushed him.
[02:30:25.185 --> 02:30:28.426]  When we see the Apostles later fasting, they have incredible victories.
[02:30:28.867 --> 02:30:35.991]  When we see, again, Esther fasting, we saw the miraculous salvation of the Jews who were slated for extermination.
[02:30:36.431 --> 02:30:41.434]  We see families that are traveling through war zones with Ezra, and they know they're just sitting ducks.
[02:30:41.874 --> 02:30:45.356]  And so before they do, they fast and they are miraculously protected.
[02:30:46.397 --> 02:30:49.759]  Derek Prince, the great Protestant evangelist, said once,
[02:30:50.379 --> 02:30:56.562]  It's almost impossible to exaggerate the power of prayer with fasting.
[02:30:57.282 --> 02:31:09.887]  And for Catholic listeners, they may be interested to know, in one of her most famous alleged apparitions, the mother of Jesus said, you have forgotten that through prayer and fasting, wars can be averted.
[02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:12.169]  Natural Holocaust can be reverted.
[02:31:12.609 --> 02:31:25.801]  So that's why we fast, is to bring about this incredible power that when God made the rules of the universe, he said, will only be fully unleashed if believers make the small sacrifice of fasting.
[02:31:26.241 --> 02:31:26.842]  So that's why.
[02:31:26.942 --> 02:31:27.702]  When do we fast?
[02:31:27.782 --> 02:31:31.005]  We fast, again, in the model of first century Christians who said,
[02:31:32.006 --> 02:31:36.348]  Believers are obligated to fast every Wednesday and Friday.
[02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:44.652]  Now, I concede, that is not in Scripture, but it's in a book, I believe the proper pronunciation is Edicti, which is a very short book.
[02:31:46.233 --> 02:31:49.615]  And these people who had observed Christ gave us that granularity.
[02:31:49.635 --> 02:31:51.636]  They also gave us the granularity that's not in Scripture.
[02:31:51.656 --> 02:31:53.637]  They said abortion is sin.
[02:31:55.262 --> 02:31:59.766]  So, although it's not in Scripture, that is a worthwhile document to consider.
[02:32:00.126 --> 02:32:06.591]  Now, let me build a little further on that with what we know in Scripture that would support the idea of fasting twice a week.
[02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:14.598]  We see the parable that Jesus gives when the rabbi and the sinner are at the temple.
[02:32:15.318 --> 02:32:21.003]  And the rabbi is saying, Oh, Lord, I tithe and I fast twice a week.
[02:32:22.403 --> 02:32:25.665]  And the Lord says, his prayer is not meritorious.
[02:32:26.546 --> 02:32:27.487]  It wasn't from the heart.
[02:32:27.987 --> 02:32:29.088]  Why was he tithing?
[02:32:29.388 --> 02:32:30.929]  Because that was the obligation.
[02:32:31.269 --> 02:32:32.510]  They had to give a minimum of 10%.
[02:32:32.991 --> 02:32:36.253]  If he had any generosity, he would have been giving 20% or something like that.
[02:32:36.273 --> 02:32:37.774]  And why was he fasting twice a week?
[02:32:38.234 --> 02:32:39.375]  Because they were obligated.
[02:32:39.415 --> 02:32:42.237]  They knew they were obligated to fast twice a week.
[02:32:42.257 --> 02:32:43.778]  Remember, Jesus said, don't do
[02:32:44.719 --> 02:32:49.705]  As the Pharisees do, but listen to what they say because they know the rules.
[02:32:50.105 --> 02:32:56.292]  We then see John the Baptist's disciples come to Jesus and they say, Lord, what is going on here?
[02:32:56.332 --> 02:32:57.594]  Your disciples aren't fasting.
[02:32:57.894 --> 02:32:59.876]  We fast like the Pharisees fast.
[02:33:00.597 --> 02:33:02.399]  We fast twice a week.
[02:33:03.641 --> 02:33:04.562]  So there is this
[02:33:05.816 --> 02:33:12.964]  Precedent that is not a smoking gun, but I would make the case supports this frequency of twice a week.
[02:33:12.984 --> 02:33:13.845]  We also see St.
[02:33:13.885 --> 02:33:20.954]  Paul explicitly saying that regular fasting is expected, especially of ministers.
[02:33:21.854 --> 02:33:24.355]  Well, the health benefits of fasting aren't debated.
[02:33:24.375 --> 02:33:25.935]  And of course, I'm very pleasantly plump.
[02:33:26.236 --> 02:33:29.417]  Doesn't mean I've ever followed all the recommendations of being healthy.
[02:33:29.897 --> 02:33:32.477]  But I mean, it makes sense to be disciplined.
[02:33:32.778 --> 02:33:40.500]  And in this decadent world, too fast is also a mental thing to also make you remember there are people that don't have food.
[02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:42.610]  Very true, very true.
[02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:44.771]  And you're right, the health benefits are extraordinary.
[02:33:45.231 --> 02:33:54.472]  Many people don't realize that a Nobel Prize was given not too long ago, specifically on the research benefits it uncovered of fasting.
[02:33:54.632 --> 02:33:56.833]  Hold on, Drew Mason, I want to come back and talk about that.
[02:33:57.153 --> 02:34:06.454]  Again, he's our new Great Gold Sponsor, but he wants to talk about his experience, how to overcome evil with prayer and fasting, as Jesus told us to do.
[02:34:06.734 --> 02:34:10.935]  We'll come back at stjosephpartners.com, and you support us when you go to infowarsgold.com.
[02:34:11.195 --> 02:34:14.338]  And that's just a tracker code that gives us some of the support for your purchases.
[02:34:14.538 --> 02:34:15.159]  So thanks a lot.
[02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:17.021]  Here we are now with Drew Mason.
[02:34:17.341 --> 02:34:22.486]  He is the principal at stjosephpartners.com and he was happy to come down here.
[02:34:22.606 --> 02:34:25.249]  He's our gold sponsor and we're really excited about him.
[02:34:25.949 --> 02:34:29.753]  You've got a great name and great credit and great reviews online.
[02:34:29.793 --> 02:34:32.075]  I've seen him on Fox News and read about him in Forbes.
[02:34:32.856 --> 02:34:36.799]  But he just has this message about the power you've had in fasting.
[02:34:36.859 --> 02:34:43.483]  So we've got this segment, the next, but personally tell me before you get back into it, how did you get into fasting and what has it done for you?
[02:34:44.644 --> 02:34:52.550]  So what really led me back into it was an experience I had when I did a mission trip behind the Iron Curtain in the 1980s.
[02:34:52.610 --> 02:35:00.796]  And it was to a town that's called Medjugorje, where although the Catholic bishops have really suppressed it, there's an incredible revival
[02:35:01.756 --> 02:35:02.316]  Breaking out.
[02:35:02.656 --> 02:35:04.017]  And that was where the message came.
[02:35:04.077 --> 02:35:08.358]  You have forgotten that through the power of prayer and fasting can avert wars.
[02:35:08.939 --> 02:35:15.801]  And it was the reminder that we are obligated to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays as is supported by the Didache and other documents.
[02:35:16.621 --> 02:35:17.722]  My experience is that
[02:35:19.162 --> 02:35:23.928]  First of all, to do it the way the first century Christians did it on bread and water is shockingly easy.
[02:35:23.948 --> 02:35:38.324]  I think one of the great victories evil has had is it has created the misperception that if you're going to make a fast worthy of God, you have to be in such pain and so weak
[02:35:39.165 --> 02:35:41.026]  That you're going to be unable to function.
[02:35:41.646 --> 02:35:46.368]  The way the first century Christians fasted on bread and water, you're going to conclude is shockingly easy.
[02:35:46.968 --> 02:35:50.109]  And the idea is that it's all about the heart.
[02:35:50.969 --> 02:35:51.750]  It's all about the heart.
[02:35:51.850 --> 02:35:57.012]  And when we start a fast, we say, Lord, you know, what you did for us is so big.
[02:35:57.952 --> 02:35:58.792]  This is so little.
[02:35:59.373 --> 02:36:00.693]  Yes, I love cheesesteaks.
[02:36:01.133 --> 02:36:02.474]  We love seafood.
[02:36:02.494 --> 02:36:03.474]  We love salads.
[02:36:03.894 --> 02:36:04.715]  But we love you more.
[02:36:04.735 --> 02:36:07.676]  So we make this tiny little sacrifice with joy, Lord.
[02:36:08.596 --> 02:36:13.700]  And restrict our intake to just bread and just water on this day, so that your spirit will come.
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:18.783]  America will be renewed, again, praying for the protection of our military, our police, our firefighters.
[02:36:19.284 --> 02:36:22.326]  And we believe we are literally helping to preserve them.
[02:36:22.846 --> 02:36:28.811]  The other thing I've seen from it, I see the health benefits that we were alluding to a moment ago, the improved focus.
[02:36:28.831 --> 02:36:36.136]  You know, a lot of Asians who are not spiritual fast because of the improved clarity you have.
[02:36:36.596 --> 02:36:37.797]  The improved energy level.
[02:36:38.157 --> 02:36:39.959]  It cleans out the toxins in your body.
[02:36:40.299 --> 02:36:49.926]  We talked about the Nobel Prize, but there's just literally been hundreds of research reports written on topics from dementia, Alzheimer's.
[02:36:49.966 --> 02:36:53.089]  Well, rats and mice, if they make fast, live like three times longer.
[02:36:53.149 --> 02:36:53.689]  It's crazy.
[02:36:53.969 --> 02:36:54.630]  It's amazing.
[02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:56.952]  They've done studies with worms, too.
[02:36:56.992 --> 02:36:58.773]  The worms live a lot longer when they make them fast.
[02:36:58.953 --> 02:36:59.994]  And it makes sense, doesn't it?
[02:37:00.074 --> 02:37:09.203]  If God is telling us to do this, that there is, of course, the primary spiritual benefit, but then there's all these ancillary benefits, including the physical.
[02:37:09.343 --> 02:37:18.452]  You asked me about what I have seen personally, too, and another benefit I would say, and I can't recommend this highly enough to parents in this world where you hear of so many
[02:37:19.787 --> 02:37:24.909]  One of the biggest difficulties out there is the protection it affords from evil.
[02:37:25.950 --> 02:37:37.616]  And we quoted earlier the 5th century evangelist who had a vision of something or a word and said, the angels protect the families that fast.
[02:37:38.276 --> 02:37:47.981]  So that is just in itself a wonderful, wonderful blessing that seems to be supported as we see again through Scripture, whether it's Ezra or in different parts of Scripture.
[02:37:48.661 --> 02:38:00.966]  So, since we're talking about health benefits, allow me, I'd like to mention one other brilliant victory evil has had with regards to fasting in modern day consciousness.
[02:38:01.686 --> 02:38:08.409]  So, as you know, when they came out with the word communism, the idea was it was community and people bought into it.
[02:38:08.829 --> 02:38:17.937]  So now that we know communism, how evil it is, what it's done to civilizations, you're never going to see a modern American politician say he's a communist.
[02:38:18.297 --> 02:38:20.719]  So they have the same principles, but they'll call it something else.
[02:38:20.759 --> 02:38:21.379]  New packaging.
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:22.801]  New packaging.
[02:38:23.421 --> 02:38:30.307]  Well, if you're evil, think about how brilliant it would be if you could get people to think they were fasting, but they weren't.
[02:38:30.567 --> 02:38:35.331]  The people were actually going through all of the difficulty, but they weren't getting the benefits.
[02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:41.181]  So you're going to say intermittent fasting is just like Ramadan, where you don't eat during the day, you only eat at night?
[02:38:41.823 --> 02:38:48.504]  Well, what I do want to say about intermittent fasting is that I believe it really is only intermittent dieting.
[02:38:49.345 --> 02:38:53.286]  But the word fasting is used and it deceives people into thinking they're fasting.
[02:38:53.586 --> 02:38:55.986]  Here's the difference between dieting and fasting.
[02:38:56.526 --> 02:39:00.087]  If you're doing it for yourself, for your own health, it's dieting.
[02:39:00.467 --> 02:39:06.949]  If you're doing it for the purpose of our Lord, repenting, coming closer to Him, that is fasting.
[02:39:07.269 --> 02:39:08.769]  So it's really a very soft,
[02:39:09.249 --> 02:39:09.590]  Difference.
[02:39:25.725 --> 02:39:31.548]  You want to ask the Lord to help you do this for the reason of Him, for fasting.
[02:39:32.008 --> 02:39:36.951]  Here's what I have found is the ultimate divider where people are saying, no way or okay.
[02:39:37.691 --> 02:39:40.733]  The way the first century Christians fasted is on bread and water.
[02:39:41.433 --> 02:39:44.515]  And if you're in intermittent fasting, you're probably thinking, I don't want to have bread.
[02:39:44.535 --> 02:39:46.336]  I'm going to have broccoli, salad, whatever.
[02:39:46.376 --> 02:39:47.917]  The worst thing I can have is carbs.
[02:39:49.414 --> 02:39:53.858]  There's a reason why heaven has told us bread and water is the best way there is to fast.
[02:39:53.918 --> 02:39:59.203]  And just think for a moment about the war on bread and what has happened.
[02:40:00.024 --> 02:40:02.787]  I know you think science has convinced you bread is bad.
[02:40:03.387 --> 02:40:07.191]  God fed his people with manna bread in the desert for 40 years.
[02:40:07.231 --> 02:40:08.232]  It wasn't a coincidence.
[02:40:08.712 --> 02:40:11.873]  Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, which means house of bread.
[02:40:12.253 --> 02:40:13.233]  It wasn't a coincidence.
[02:40:13.594 --> 02:40:15.474]  Jesus fed the 5,000 with bread.
[02:40:15.814 --> 02:40:17.215]  It wasn't a coincidence.
[02:40:17.635 --> 02:40:24.237]  He said he was the bread of life, and in his greatest miracle of all, at the Last Supper, he said, this is my body in the form of bread.
[02:40:24.277 --> 02:40:28.418]  There is more to it than just a modern science theory telling you that bread is bad.
[02:40:29.418 --> 02:40:31.979]  First century bread had no preservatives.
[02:40:32.399 --> 02:40:32.819]  So 100% whole grain.
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:39.161]  Genetically engineered where it's a lot smaller and it's a different type of grain.
[02:40:39.421 --> 02:40:40.921]  You're right, you're right.
[02:40:40.941 --> 02:40:48.423]  The breads that you get that are changed for elongated shelf life are not any good.
[02:40:49.083 --> 02:40:49.683]  They're not any good.
[02:40:49.703 --> 02:40:56.685]  If you get 100% whole grain bread, University of Oakland concluded this is the missing piece in the puzzle for American health.
[02:40:56.765 --> 02:40:58.445]  The vitamins, all that it brings to you.
[02:40:59.025 --> 02:41:00.846]  So I would say to you that
[02:41:02.146 --> 02:41:04.568]  Fasting is so good for you physically.
[02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:09.431]  I pursue bread and water fasting because of heaven's guidance that this is the best fast.
[02:41:09.491 --> 02:41:13.093]  It's the way the first century Christians fasted, and we do it twice a week.
[02:41:13.634 --> 02:41:15.215]  We talked a little bit about the results.
[02:41:15.655 --> 02:41:17.436]  I want to share a couple of stories with you.
[02:41:18.457 --> 02:41:29.624]  The organization C12 came up with some fascinating insights, and they found out in London during World War II, the Nazis were bombing it to death.
[02:41:29.705 --> 02:41:30.805]  It was on its last
[02:41:32.186 --> 02:41:33.027]  Last gasps.
[02:41:33.868 --> 02:41:39.552]  And some of the Brits got together and they said, we have to start fasting for a heavenly rescue.
[02:41:40.773 --> 02:41:41.494]  And they did.
[02:41:42.135 --> 02:41:49.481]  Now, we can't prove that this is what happened by any means, but something very at least coincidental happened that is striking.
[02:41:49.941 --> 02:41:51.622]  Hitler, who had built this superstar
[02:41:52.944 --> 02:41:53.504]  We're good.
[02:42:09.042 --> 02:42:11.964]  It's the incredible story that we see again and again through scriptures.
[02:42:12.024 --> 02:42:20.349]  And so I come to you and I would say to, I know so many of you are patriots who love this country and you're sitting there wondering, what can I do for this country?
[02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:24.132]  You may feel like you don't have any financial resources to contribute.
[02:42:24.152 --> 02:42:24.972]  You don't have time.
[02:42:26.013 --> 02:42:27.354]  You may be unemployed.
[02:42:27.894 --> 02:42:34.978]  If you feel like you have been such a disappointment to whoever, yourself, your family, if you're humble like that,
[02:42:36.059 --> 02:42:40.600]  You are the warrior that evil fears the most.
[02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:43.821]  If you will fast, you will change history.
[02:42:44.462 --> 02:42:51.404]  And you will have bragging rights for eternity that you will be so glad you've made this little effort.
[02:42:52.344 --> 02:42:58.731]  And I truly believe that what we are seeing happening is this renaissance in America that's beginning to roll.
[02:42:58.931 --> 02:43:02.975]  All right, Drew Mason, definitely a man on a mission, and we know fasting's good for you.
[02:43:03.095 --> 02:43:04.737]  And I know it's in the Bible, I believe in it.
[02:43:05.257 --> 02:43:07.600]  I don't know how I'm going to be able to do it, but we're going to try.
[02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:10.082]  But when we come back, though, let's talk about
[02:43:10.703 --> 02:43:15.326]  The fact that all this evil that's taking place is waking people up and there's that positive effect on the other side.
[02:43:15.346 --> 02:43:20.048]  And I agree, people shouldn't get depressed and down because scripture is all being fulfilled.
[02:43:20.108 --> 02:43:22.150]  I mean, this is world government's out in the open now.
[02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:26.792]  My job has been exposing the new world order and the fact that it exists in world government and they're bad guys.
[02:43:26.852 --> 02:43:28.293]  Now most people know that's true.
[02:43:28.773 --> 02:43:31.575]  Now he's talking about the positive, what we're fighting for and ways to fight back.
[02:43:31.595 --> 02:43:36.638]  So we're getting into fasting, but I was begging you, get into the gold and silver some too, because you're our sponsor.
[02:43:36.678 --> 02:43:39.560]  And I want people to buy a lot of silver and gold because I think they should get it.
[02:43:43.402 --> 02:43:48.406]  So, you were saying, too, that there's so much that discourages people.
[02:43:49.206 --> 02:43:53.689]  There is so much good news happening out there, and I want to encourage you to think about Scripture.
[02:43:53.709 --> 02:43:56.091]  There's a reason why Jesus said, fear not.
[02:43:56.792 --> 02:43:58.092]  We have nothing to fear but God.
[02:43:58.893 --> 02:44:01.495]  No disease, no political group.
[02:44:02.516 --> 02:44:03.616]  Nothing to fear but God.
[02:44:04.537 --> 02:44:11.401]  And coming on here, I had the thought while I was praying of Elijah, the great Jewish prophet.
[02:44:11.782 --> 02:44:17.385]  And we won't get into details here, but he just had extraordinary miracles pouring through him.
[02:44:18.106 --> 02:44:24.030]  And then one day, the king's wife said some bad things about him, said we were going to come after him.
[02:44:24.470 --> 02:44:25.671]  And Elijah retreated.
[02:44:27.133 --> 02:44:31.174]  And it turns out, or plays out, he's in a cave hiding.
[02:44:31.935 --> 02:44:35.016]  And the Lord says to him, what are you doing here?
[02:44:36.176 --> 02:44:37.137]  What are you doing here?
[02:44:37.157 --> 02:44:38.657]  You've seen all that I do.
[02:44:38.977 --> 02:44:41.898]  You saw the miracles, the fire I brought down as you prayed.
[02:44:42.278 --> 02:44:42.959]  What are you doing here?
[02:44:43.499 --> 02:44:46.540]  And I think that is really a message for us in America today, too.
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:47.620]  What are we doing here?
[02:44:48.181 --> 02:44:48.981]  Why are we scared?
[02:44:49.281 --> 02:44:51.442]  Why are we intimidated by these Satanists?
[02:44:52.176 --> 02:44:53.717]  Because we've got the power, we've got Christ.
[02:44:53.797 --> 02:44:55.498]  We have the power, we have the victory.
[02:44:56.038 --> 02:44:58.579]  And we're looking in the wrong places for leadership.
[02:44:59.199 --> 02:45:06.883]  So I fully believe as we pray and as we fast, local leaders are going to begin, the scales are going to fall from their eyes.
[02:45:06.943 --> 02:45:11.726]  It's going to come clearer and clearer what we need to do in terms of our strategy.
[02:45:11.746 --> 02:45:14.447]  And it will give you confidence in
[02:45:14.947 --> 02:45:17.070]  and peace and stepping forward and having courage.
[02:45:17.491 --> 02:45:28.506]  One of the great messages from Medjugorje said, if you will preach the gospel without fear, the truth will miraculously win.
[02:45:28.526 --> 02:45:31.270]  The truth will miraculously win.
[02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:34.812]  And that's why I began my comments with the words, praise be Jesus.
[02:45:35.112 --> 02:45:35.712]  Three words.
[02:45:36.072 --> 02:45:43.957]  He's preaching the gospel and I'm riding on her coattails and believing and I'm seeing how the truth is miraculously winning.
[02:45:44.437 --> 02:45:48.799]  So there is so much cause for optimism and hope.
[02:45:48.819 --> 02:45:50.140]  There's so much good that's coming on.
[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:51.561]  I do want to encourage you.
[02:45:52.461 --> 02:45:55.443]  Don't feel like your participation isn't important.
[02:45:56.384 --> 02:45:59.886]  Satan tells you, you can't have any impact on the world.
[02:46:00.286 --> 02:46:01.047]  You're not powerful.
[02:46:01.407 --> 02:46:09.172]  God is telling you, if you had any idea how powerful just your response alone is, you would be brought to tears.
[02:46:09.212 --> 02:46:13.134]  The more people, as it says, what two people agree upon on earth, God makes it so in heaven.
[02:46:13.154 --> 02:46:16.456]  The more of us together believing, that brings God in.
[02:46:16.476 --> 02:46:17.177]  That is so true.
[02:46:17.217 --> 02:46:17.877]  That's a great point.
[02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:25.336]  It says there's an exponential power that comes to the world when believers join together.
[02:46:25.736 --> 02:46:28.119]  So we don't need a hundred million people to join us.
[02:46:28.319 --> 02:46:35.086]  And that's why all over the world they're trying to shut churches down, but also conservative, you know, Orthodox, Jewish centers, everything.
[02:46:35.386 --> 02:46:37.308]  Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, they're shutting them all down.
[02:46:37.728 --> 02:46:38.048]  Amen.
[02:46:38.268 --> 02:46:42.071]  And it's wonderful to see this awakening that is happening.
[02:46:42.831 --> 02:46:44.472]  The scales falling from people's eyes.
[02:46:44.833 --> 02:46:46.053]  So I really want to encourage you.
[02:46:46.594 --> 02:46:48.795]  It's so easy to fast on bread and water.
[02:46:48.815 --> 02:46:50.976]  If you're hungry during the day, have as much bread as you want.
[02:46:50.996 --> 02:46:52.817]  Again, go for 100% whole grains.
[02:46:53.218 --> 02:46:55.099]  If you want to put some butter on it, some olive oil.
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:59.742]  You know, if you're diabetic, talk to your doctor, but put almond butter on there, things like that.
[02:47:00.322 --> 02:47:03.264]  It's not that this is a great burden.
[02:47:03.665 --> 02:47:06.927]  Again, this is whole grain bread, tons of protein, tons of B vitamins.
[02:47:06.947 --> 02:47:08.308]  It's just a little sacrifice.
[02:47:08.768 --> 02:47:09.769]  That's all God's looking for.
[02:47:09.789 --> 02:47:13.212]  If you think about it, we had paradise, right?
[02:47:13.732 --> 02:47:16.494]  And all God asked us to do was the tiniest little fast.
[02:47:16.554 --> 02:47:18.255]  Just don't eat that sugar on the apple tree.
[02:47:19.176 --> 02:47:22.919]  And Satan, being the great salesman that he is, they are masters with words.
[02:47:23.988 --> 02:47:26.971]  Didn't talk about, I'm evil and you're going to be destroyed.
[02:47:27.651 --> 02:47:31.996]  Talked about you becoming God-like and that the sea is paradise.
[02:47:32.116 --> 02:47:36.320]  That's what big tech says now, is we're going to merge and become God with machines.
[02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:37.481]  It's the same story again.
[02:47:38.141 --> 02:47:39.322]  But you got to get rid of the Christians.
[02:47:39.362 --> 02:47:42.666]  Now, briefly, let's talk about gold in the Bible.
[02:47:43.416 --> 02:47:46.178]  So the history of gold is incredible.
[02:47:46.778 --> 02:47:54.683]  It literally goes back to Genesis before Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden, which is amazing.
[02:47:54.703 --> 02:47:59.907]  You wouldn't think there'd be any reason for gold, any reason for stores of value back then, but it literally goes back that far.
[02:48:00.827 --> 02:48:06.591]  And whether you go to the Chinese, ancient Chinese civilizations, pick your civilization, it has preserved wealth.
[02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:07.992]  What else does it say in the Bible?
[02:48:09.093 --> 02:48:12.335]  I believe, and this is something that Wall Street will laugh at,
[02:48:14.318 --> 02:48:16.479]  Finance is supposed to be just about the track record.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.121]  Gold's track record is spectacular.
[02:48:19.141 --> 02:48:25.204]  7% a year since it's begun trading freely for an asset that is as risk-free as there is in the world.
[02:48:25.224 --> 02:48:26.625]  8% a year this century.
[02:48:27.326 --> 02:48:33.789]  That's incredibly credible for an asset that has no counterparty risk, that has no liabilities, and it's always worked.
[02:48:33.909 --> 02:48:34.650]  Why is it?
[02:48:34.850 --> 02:48:35.610]  It's very personal.
[02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:36.251]  It's very intimate.
[02:48:36.591 --> 02:48:36.891]  It is.
[02:48:36.911 --> 02:48:37.651]  It is.
[02:48:38.732 --> 02:48:44.454]  And so why could it be that Wall Street and financial advisors hate this so much?
[02:48:44.474 --> 02:48:50.896]  Well, part of the reason clearly is that it's a less profitable product line than derivatives.
[02:48:51.436 --> 02:49:01.239]  Part of the reason, surely, even if unintentionally, is that gold is, again, so simple that it removes the need for some intermediary or advisor.
[02:49:01.259 --> 02:49:01.660]  Well, that's it.
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:05.401]  You can't add a bunch of cost onto it and a bunch of fees.
[02:49:06.641 --> 02:49:07.621]  It is very transparent.
[02:49:08.262 --> 02:49:09.642]  It is completely transparent.
[02:49:10.162 --> 02:49:14.163]  And a third reason I would give you is, I believe it is biblical.
[02:49:14.724 --> 02:49:22.366]  And in the Jewish scriptures, God actually makes the statement, the gold and the silver are mine.
[02:49:24.186 --> 02:49:25.567]  So if you're evil,
[02:49:26.894 --> 02:49:39.999]  And if there's value and good to gold, as he was counseling us, because in the New Testament, it's the only asset that I see, reading scriptures, where God specifically counsels us to buy gold so that we may grow wealthy in Revelation.
[02:49:40.379 --> 02:49:48.922]  Now, I understand completely that the primary intent of that statement, to buy gold, refined in the fire so you may grow wealthy,
[02:49:49.662 --> 02:49:53.285]  It wasn't literal, it was spiritual, but God could have chosen any other asset.
[02:49:53.305 --> 02:49:59.569]  He could have said, go and buy farmland, go and buy oceanfront real estate where you can catch the treasures of the sea.
[02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:01.371]  There's a reason why he said gold.
[02:50:01.711 --> 02:50:05.053]  And if you look at the track record, it has indeed preserved wealth.
[02:50:05.153 --> 02:50:08.856]  So those are some of the things I see biblically, Alex, that
[02:50:15.876 --> 02:50:17.296]  Absolutely.
[02:50:17.396 --> 02:50:23.478]  And again, you're selling as much gold as you can get your hands on right now, but you're actually ready to deliver it to people within three weeks.
[02:50:23.538 --> 02:50:24.218]  And we'll buy it.
[02:50:25.018 --> 02:50:27.219]  If you want to sell gold, we'll buy any kind of gold you have.
[02:50:27.299 --> 02:50:28.219]  Broken jewelry.
[02:50:29.019 --> 02:50:29.880]  Whatever it may be.
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:30.941]  Your old dental fillings.
[02:50:31.301 --> 02:50:41.312]  If you have a form of gold that isn't very liquid, an odd-shaped bar, we'll buy it and help you swap into much more liquid gold, like we were talking about earlier, that's minted by a sovereign mint.
[02:50:41.332 --> 02:50:41.592]  That's right.
[02:50:41.612 --> 02:50:45.376]  This is a hot market, but you guys are great folks, good service, and you're not ripping people off.
[02:50:45.736 --> 02:50:49.320]  And again, people, if you want to support them, they are sponsoring you to go to InfoWarsGold.com.
[02:50:50.201 --> 02:50:51.642]  That's www.infowarsgold.com.
[02:50:51.962 --> 02:50:56.926]  That's just a link that goes so we get some support from your purchases to www.stjosephpartners.com.
[02:50:56.946 --> 02:50:58.747]  But that's www.infowarsgold.com.
[02:50:59.068 --> 02:51:01.370]  And that will help fund our operation to expose the New World Order.
[02:51:01.410 --> 02:51:04.452]  And I'm just glad to have a good reputable gold company like you with us.
[02:51:04.732 --> 02:51:11.017]  And on top of it, you're definitely trying to get people to focus on Christ, the spiritual nature of this, because that's everything.
[02:51:11.578 --> 02:51:16.982]  And from so many perspectives, just fasting is going to make you think about God the whole time you're doing it and why you're doing it.
[02:51:17.282 --> 02:51:21.145]  So it's not like a negative thing to make it about a sacrifice for God, not as for your health.
[02:51:21.405 --> 02:51:23.287]  I mean, it's a good thing to make it about that while you do it.
[02:51:24.007 --> 02:51:26.049]  It is a blessing to be here and to share.
[02:51:26.069 --> 02:51:36.638]  And one group I didn't specify, Alex has a very admirable bunch of young adults and even students who are in his audience.
[02:51:37.078 --> 02:51:40.421]  I want to just reach out to you and say, I think your future is so bright.
[02:51:41.101 --> 02:51:43.524]  I know you read all these headlines and you think it's so negative.
[02:51:43.624 --> 02:51:44.845]  I think your future is so bright.
[02:51:45.365 --> 02:51:47.588]  And I meet young people again and again and again.
[02:51:47.988 --> 02:51:49.229]  You are so talented.
[02:51:49.950 --> 02:51:51.351]  You are so talented.
[02:51:52.011 --> 02:51:53.132]  Don't let anybody discourage you.
[02:51:53.652 --> 02:51:57.214]  We are blessed to have you, and you have a very bright future.
[02:51:57.634 --> 02:51:57.994]  Well, you're right.
[02:51:58.054 --> 02:51:59.635]  I need to focus more on the positive.
[02:51:59.655 --> 02:52:05.859]  I want people to also know how bad the globalists are, that they're going to really hurt us bad, so we reject them, but there's also so much good in the universe.
[02:52:06.139 --> 02:52:18.946]  It's just that we have to really expose, because sometimes it seems mean to really expose Bill Gates and the New World Order and Klaus Schwab and Xi Jinping, but they're really bad people and I think they have to be exposed, but that's the positive point that we're still on air to be exposing them.
[02:52:19.346 --> 02:52:19.646]  Amen.
[02:52:19.786 --> 02:52:22.048]  And there is so much good, so many good people out there.
[02:52:22.068 --> 02:52:24.109]  I'm sure you see all the time too Alex, as you travel.
[02:52:24.709 --> 02:52:27.471]  America is just filled with wonderful people.
[02:52:28.680 --> 02:52:29.581]  And we have a bright future.
[02:52:49.736 --> 02:52:51.540]  They're almost all now admitting they're Satanists.
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:58.333]  They didn't have national documentaries out admitting the Democratic Party's new mascot's the devil, and Joe Biden just canceled the National Day of Prayer.
[02:52:58.774 --> 02:53:00.497]  Alright folks, that's it for this transmission.
[02:53:04.912 --> 02:53:21.864]  One of the best selling supplements in the United States and across the world in the last decade is magnesium powders because they work so good because they're critical to all your cells to operating smoothly to your heart, to your brain, to your liver, to everything.
[02:53:21.904 --> 02:53:24.526]  It's something you can take in the morning and it doesn't make you tired.
[02:53:24.566 --> 02:53:26.907]  It makes you have smooth, clean energy.
[02:53:27.888 --> 02:53:31.191]  Every other nutrient you get is basically boosted by it.
[02:53:31.211 --> 02:53:36.315]  I'm going to go over some of the facts from the fact sheet that scientists have put together here in a moment.
[02:53:36.375 --> 02:53:37.977]  But first I want to just explain something.
[02:53:38.897 --> 02:53:40.879]  It took us several years to get this developed.
[02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:44.582]  Because I fund my operations selling products that work and that people want.
[02:53:45.463 --> 02:53:52.849]  And clearly you go to the grocery store, you go anywhere, you see them selling different brands and different forms of magnesium fizzy drinks.
[02:53:53.650 --> 02:53:55.371]  And it's something that when I forget to do it,
[02:53:56.365 --> 02:53:57.406]  My day isn't as good.
[02:53:57.946 --> 02:54:06.031]  I've been religiously, since this came in a few weeks ago, and now we've got the full shipment as we can sell it, taking it, and it's just made my life so much better.
[02:54:06.291 --> 02:54:09.753]  And it goes great with the X2, it goes great with the Brain Force Plus.
[02:54:10.133 --> 02:54:11.094]  It really is amazing.
[02:54:11.254 --> 02:54:17.918]  It's our new Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Orange Flavored Drink Mix from M4sLife.com.
[02:54:18.298 --> 02:54:19.799]  Here's the scientific fact sheet.
[02:54:20.379 --> 02:54:23.980]  True Ionic Magnesium for Optimal Absorption.
[02:54:24.380 --> 02:54:25.320]  That is so important.
[02:54:25.640 --> 02:54:27.120]  The other brands work great.
[02:54:27.521 --> 02:54:31.501]  Magnesium is amazing, but they have one type of magnesium.
[02:54:31.821 --> 02:54:43.284]  This has two types of magnesium, and then when you add the other things that are in the formula, the scientist explained to us that it creates the very best form of ionized magnesium.
[02:54:43.584 --> 02:54:45.986]  that is absorbed directly into your individual cells.
[02:54:46.346 --> 02:54:47.346]  Here's another important fact.
[02:54:47.707 --> 02:54:53.811]  An estimated 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended amount of magnesium intake every single day.
[02:54:54.091 --> 02:54:59.994]  Magnesium helps regulate the sodium-potassium pumps that create the signals in the nerve cells.
[02:55:00.355 --> 02:55:08.540]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[02:55:08.860 --> 02:55:09.441]  Thank you.
[02:55:30.823 --> 02:55:31.644]  I take it in the morning.
[02:55:31.985 --> 02:55:32.906]  I take it in the evening.
[02:55:33.427 --> 02:55:38.233]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[02:55:38.493 --> 02:55:41.097]  It's available at mfulmorestore.com right now.
[02:55:41.417 --> 02:55:45.062]  You can get one canister for $19.95, and the second canister is $14.95.
[02:55:46.644 --> 02:55:50.147]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[02:55:50.427 --> 02:55:54.430]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[02:55:54.450 --> 02:55:58.853]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the InfoWar, which is a true 360 win.
[02:55:58.953 --> 02:56:03.376]  Now exclusively available at InfoWarStore.com for only $19.95.
[02:56:03.556 --> 02:56:08.379]  I'm about to cut a very important ad for X2.
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:11.481]  Impromptu, no teleprompter, no notes, no script.
[02:56:12.022 --> 02:56:13.303]  And you know what I'm thinking about right now?
[02:56:14.397 --> 02:56:27.262]  I'm thinking about what an idiot I am because I started taking X2 seven years ago and I lost about 30 pounds in four months and my skin got healthier, my hair got healthier, my libido went off the chart.
[02:56:27.723 --> 02:56:35.006]  Everything that Dr. Group told me would happen back then when I took real atomic iodine that nobody else had on the market came true.
[02:56:35.626 --> 02:56:49.976]  And now I'm sitting here in the year 2021 realizing that on a routine basis I forget to take my X2 and I have a Lazy Susan that I put on the dining room table that my wife continues to move off of it.
[02:56:50.357 --> 02:56:52.078]  She remembers to take her supplements, I don't.
[02:56:52.418 --> 02:56:54.360]  So when I get home tonight I'm going to put the Lazy Susan
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:00.684]  Back out there on the table, it's actually the breakfast table, and I'm going to make sure that I religiously take it every morning.
[02:57:01.065 --> 02:57:02.145]  It's so incredible.
[02:57:02.466 --> 02:57:03.807]  And by the way, it's been sold out for a while.
[02:57:04.247 --> 02:57:05.228]  It's now back in stock.
[02:57:05.248 --> 02:57:08.150]  We have the spray bottle of it, so it aerosolizes into your throat.
[02:57:08.530 --> 02:57:10.752]  And we also have the system where it's a dropper.
[02:57:11.272 --> 02:57:14.895]  Take it under the tongue for more absorption, but it really is amazing.
[02:57:14.915 --> 02:57:18.898]  And consult your physician beforehand because it's the good halogen, the opposite of fluoride.
[02:57:19.378 --> 02:57:21.099]  X2 is back in stock.
[02:57:21.419 --> 02:57:22.959]  People ask me, well, why do you have X3 then?
[02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:27.060]  A very small percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:29.081]  This is true atomic, pure iodine.
[02:57:29.101 --> 02:57:32.022]  We have to have like a DEA license to get it and manufacture it.
[02:57:32.782 --> 02:57:38.904]  The other iodine is a triiodine, all three types of iodine, and it's better for some folks, not as good for others.
[02:57:39.224 --> 02:57:43.705]  It's apples and oranges, you decide, but X3 is also available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:44.045 --> 02:57:47.126]  X2 and X3 available at InfoWarsTore.com and X2
[02:57:47.386 --> 02:57:53.021]  Two at 50% off right now, and it funds the Infowar, a true 360 win.
[02:57:53.061 --> 02:57:54.785]  If you haven't tried X2, now's the time.
