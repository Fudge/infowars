[00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.615]  When is enough going to be enough?
[00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:29.706]  When is the death toll, the genocide by medical tyranny, going to be enough to wake up humanity, Congress, the governors, to stand against this global UN takeover?
[00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:39.456]  It is Sunday, March 24th, the year of 2021, and marvelous Marvin Hagler, one of my favorite boxers, world champion mediumweight, died.
[00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:51.825]  And friends and family said that he was admitted to the hospital one day after getting an mRNA vaccine and was fighting for his life from the quote, effects of the vaccine and died.
[00:00:51.825 --> 00:01:00.771]  When we come back next segment on this live Sunday transmission with myself and Owen Schroeder, we're going to lay out the facts and what's really happening and how to stop it.
[00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:05.394]  Because after all, they're having a big problem covering up the incredible death toll.
[00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:09.217]  The question is, why would they roll something out like this, knowing that we get caught?
[00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:13.231]  Who's got a gun to Big Pharma's head to do this?
[00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:15.172]  I've got the answer straight ahead.
[00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:16.413]  This is InfoWars.
[00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:17.414]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:22.057]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:26.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer sitting in the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.183]  I have a ton of news that I'm going to be getting to in the next two hours.
[00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:38.267]  Of course, we have an emergency report coming up from Alex Jones on that subject that you just heard of.
[00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.245]  People dying from the vaccine.
[00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:46.668]  And you know, it is a real strange time to be alive.
[00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:51.849]  Because if you're having conversations with people, you realize, hey, you know what?
[00:01:51.849 --> 00:02:04.073]  Even the liberals, you know, even the Trump dissidents, even some of the TDS people are kind of starting to realize, hmm, maybe I've been duped.
[00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.134]  Maybe I've become a pawn of the establishment.
[00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:09.164]  Hey, you know, I don't want to take a vaccine.
[00:02:09.164 --> 00:02:12.685]  Hey, you know, I don't want to wear a mask.
[00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:20.669]  But now that you see something starting to reopen, people starting to get out into the world again, they realize, you know, maybe there's nothing to be afraid of.
[00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:21.869]  Maybe I shouldn't be so afraid.
[00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:34.455]  And so what we're seeing now is it's the most brainwashed, propagandized, Stockholm Syndrome people are going to go deeper into their trance.
[00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:42.869]  Deeper into their programming and really just fully commit to this, to being pawns of the New World Order.
[00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:55.079]  Versus people who were kind of just deceived, but maybe didn't really invest too much time or research into these issues, but did what they felt was good emotionally and kind of bought into the mainstream propaganda.
[00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.806]  Didn't really think all the networks and Hollywood celebs would rely on them, but now they're kind of starting to open their eyes as the tyranny gets worse.
[00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.346]  Freedom is popular.
[00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:20.692]  And you can only take freedom away from people who yearn to be free for so long before almost like a drug addict kind of, except it's not a drug, but you want it again.
[00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:21.953]  You want to be free.
[00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:24.074]  You want to go out and not see a bunch of people in masks.
[00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.615]  You want to be able to go back to work without taking a vaccine.
[00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:28.916]  You're sick of debating should the schools be open or closed.
[00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:32.147]  You're sick of wondering, can I go to church this week or not?
[00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:36.307]  You're sick of wondering, when can I take the mask off?
[00:03:36.307 --> 00:03:45.990]  But I'm noticing, as some people are kind of having their awakening, even celebrities will talk about, like Sarah Silverman.
[00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.870]  Oh, she doesn't want to be associated with the Democrat Party anymore.
[00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.491]  Oh, that's funny.
[00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.911]  But hey, good for her.
[00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:53.792]  Maybe she's getting it.
[00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:54.172]  You know what?
[00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:58.113]  I was just used by these people, and now I look like an idiot.
[00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.573]  I don't want to look like that anymore.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.322]  Good for her.
[00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.903]  But there's all kinds of weirdness going on.
[00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:15.148]  We've got a video of a lady who's a hero here in Texas who got arrested for refusing to wear a mask into a Bank of America.
[00:04:15.148 --> 00:04:18.671]  You know, it makes it really hard to be with Back the Blue.
[00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:25.775]  It makes it really hard to fully commit to Blue Lives Matter when you see stuff like this.
[00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:30.178]  It's gonna really make it hard not to say defund the police.
[00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.703]  When they're being used to arrest kind old ladies like this.
[00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:35.563]  Shouldn't even call her old.
[00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:41.526]  She's obviously young at heart and spirit, but... She gets arrested.
[00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:43.868]  She gets thrown to the ground.
[00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:45.088]  Because she doesn't want to put a mask on.
[00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:48.130]  I mean, how dare she want to breathe free air?
[00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.192]  Oh, by the way, more bad news for Cuomo.
[00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:54.393]  You thought he just sent COVID into the nursing homes?
[00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:55.374]  Uh-oh.
[00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:57.635]  Looks like he got caught sending it somewhere else as well.
[00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:04.806]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:07.809]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.431]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:13.433]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:17.036]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:19.338]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:26.240]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.380]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.421]  Because it's so simple.
[00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.481]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:41.363]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:43.684]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:46.824]  It funds the InfoWare at the same time.
[00:05:46.824 --> 00:05:48.685]  No other product you can buy does that.
[00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:51.026]  So again, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:53.106]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.126]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:56.587]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[00:05:56.587 --> 00:06:07.790]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:16.212]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:26.137]  The undisputed middleweight champion of the world, Marvelous Marvin Hackler is dead today, according to friends and family.
[00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.490]  He died from the effects of the vaccine.
[00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:36.717]  He was admitted to the emergency room yesterday and died today after taking the vaccine, just like Hank Aaron.
[00:06:36.717 --> 00:06:38.739]  And I'll talk about that here in just a moment.
[00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:46.245]  But if you remember, last year, Bill Gates said on national TV that 80% of people would get bad side effects and that 700,000 people would get sick or die.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.441]  How would he even know that with unapproved vaccines that they're now testing that are unapproved?
[00:06:56.441 --> 00:07:01.082]  Because they tested them secretly in animals years before they rolled out COVID-19.
[00:07:01.082 --> 00:07:03.702]  This is a large strategic plan.
[00:07:03.702 --> 00:07:06.123]  It's not the virus you've got to fear.
[00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:08.043]  It is the effects of the vaccine.
[00:07:08.043 --> 00:07:13.924]  It's not a vaccine that's mRNA and goes in and reprograms your body and makes your body attack itself.
[00:07:13.924 --> 00:07:19.285]  That's why two and a half months ago, England, one week into their vaccination program, the first country to do it,
[00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:25.020]  They banned giving above 75-year-olds the shot because it was killing so many.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.724]  Well, marvelous Marvin Hagler was 66.
[00:07:28.724 --> 00:07:30.706]  They also say pregnant women shouldn't take it.
[00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:31.546]  Does it stop the U.S.
[00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:35.050]  government pushing on pregnant women and children, including babies?
[00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:36.998]  So he's dead now.
[00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:47.662]  Now, it's easy to cover up the massive deaths in nursing homes and the massive deaths at nun convents and the massive deaths taking place inside hospitals from the vaccine.
[00:07:47.662 --> 00:07:52.183]  But all the famous people dying from it, they're having a real problem.
[00:07:52.183 --> 00:08:01.386]  And if you remember when Hank Aaron died after taking the second shot of the Pfizer shot, the media said, oh, we talked to the medical examiner.
[00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:02.066]  They did an autopsy.
[00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:04.047]  He didn't die of the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:05.187]  The family came out and told
[00:08:05.945 --> 00:08:06.786]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:11.671]  that they didn't do an autopsy and that he died after the second shot.
[00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:22.040]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I have stacks of articles every day of 25-year-old women, 15-year-old men, 80-year-old people, 35-year-old people, I mean, you name it, dying constantly.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.563]  And these are just the ones that are getting reported to the press.
[00:08:24.563 --> 00:08:27.305]  We're talking about the organs liquefying.
[00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:29.367]  Here's just one on Infowars.com today.
[00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:30.949]  There's like five of them up there today.
[00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:36.388]  Physical therapist, 28, dies two days after receiving COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:08:36.388 --> 00:08:42.693]  Out in Utah, this 37-year-old mother had a nine-year-old daughter, totally healthy.
[00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:48.377]  A nurse took the vaccine, her liver liquefied, and they said she died of the vaccine, but it'd be hard to prove.
[00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:50.299]  That's what a medical examiner said.
[00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:53.041]  Plus, these companies have liability protection from this.
[00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:55.883]  So, are you going to sit here and take this?
[00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:56.763]  Why are they doing it?
[00:08:56.763 --> 00:08:58.805]  Why would they roll something out, skip animal trials?
[00:08:59.457 --> 00:09:12.624]  Because he already did animal trials under the guise of other similar vaccines before, and knew what it did to the animals, which was sterilize them, make them sick, make them have autoimmune disorders, make them have a cytokine storm, really bad allergic reactions.
[00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:19.908]  And most of the top scientists, including the former chief scientist at Pfizer, went public and said, don't take this, and filed an emergency injunction back in December.
[00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:23.490]  With Joaquin Woodard in the EU.
[00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:30.715]  And India and Switzerland and South Africa and a bunch of other countries have pulled these vaccines and said they're not safe.
[00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.877]  And said plus they don't protect you from COVID-19.
[00:09:33.877 --> 00:09:34.418]  And guess what?
[00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:36.419]  That's in the news today as well.
[00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:40.122]  Canadian Health Chief says COVID restrictions may continue even after taking vaccine.
[00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:45.182]  And Biden went on TV three nights ago and said, it doesn't matter if you have the vaccine, you're still locked down.
[00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:47.083]  This is permanent martial law.
[00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.265]  You can't create a vaccine for the common cold.
[00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:52.627]  COVID is a patented synthetic cold virus, so they own it.
[00:09:52.627 --> 00:09:57.810]  Anybody will die without vitamin B12, without vitamin D3, without vitamin C and zinc.
[00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.311]  If you don't have those things, you die.
[00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.912]  Any virus can kill you.
[00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:04.175]  Any virus can go in and replicate your cells.
[00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:08.497]  That's why they don't want you to know that or about hydroxychloroquine or any of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:08.497 --> 00:10:09.758]  Any of it.
[00:10:09.758 --> 00:10:10.699]  So this is a takeover.
[00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.589]  And they want to just normalize, be a hero, go take the shot.
[00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:18.575]  So all these sports icons roll their sleeves up, they go take it, and they die.
[00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:19.877]  And then of course you've got Ben Stein.
[00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:31.712]  He took one of the mRNA vaccines and called it a killer, but said, oh, I'm not attacking vaccines, because he knows you'll get demonized if you do that, because big techs merge with big pharma and says you can't do it.
[00:10:31.712 --> 00:10:37.014]  A word of warning to you, my fellow Americans, or whatever you are.
[00:10:37.014 --> 00:10:45.676]  I had the COVID booster, the Moderna, about four or five days ago, and I am still feeling wild side effects from it.
[00:10:46.256 --> 00:10:56.184]  Like I had the worst flu in the world, extreme shortness of breath, a dizziness, fatigue, extremely irrational thinking.
[00:10:56.184 --> 00:10:58.526]  It has just been devastating.
[00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:01.108]  I'm glad I got it, sort of glad.
[00:11:01.108 --> 00:11:05.792]  I don't know, a little bit glad and also not quite so glad.
[00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:09.415]  But it has just got to be told to the people.
[00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:14.943]  Us people, we people, us people, that this booster is a killer.
[00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:19.426]  I mean, it's not going to kill you literally, but it is very, very strong.
[00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:21.348]  Beware.
[00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:27.313]  So marvelous Marvin Hagler could survive all those incredible boxing matches.
[00:11:27.313 --> 00:11:29.694]  He could go through all the grueling training.
[00:11:29.694 --> 00:11:33.918]  He could be the world champion and be loved all over the world.
[00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:44.635]  And he could be successful in life and defeat all those adversities, but he couldn't, at 66 years old, defeat the vaccine that he took, which they're saying is an mRNA vaccine.
[00:11:44.635 --> 00:11:54.436]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can't have companies with liability protection that are allowed to do this and then have government try to mandate it and make us take it to, quote, be able to taste freedom, as CNN said.
[00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:56.657]  And of course, they didn't take that freedom away as well.
[00:11:56.657 --> 00:11:57.937]  This is a black hole.
[00:11:57.937 --> 00:11:59.277]  This is a bear trap.
[00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:01.558]  This is a takeover.
[00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:03.898]  So I'm going to leave you with some of the famous highlights of
[00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:10.601]  Marvelous Marvin Hagler and we're going to go to the live show today with Owen Troyer doing a great job here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:16.003]  I'll be back in studio tomorrow 11 a.m central but be safe out there.
[00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:18.224]  And one more point.
[00:12:18.224 --> 00:12:25.287]  I have friends, I have neighbors, I have family that are like Alex we've heard your opinion about the vaccine, we've heard your opinion about the death numbers being exaggerated.
[00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:27.708]  You're probably right but stop giving us information.
[00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:28.488]  Well you know what?
[00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:31.430]  I'm going to give my friends, my family, my neighbors information.
[00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.231]  If more people would have warned folks about Hank Aaron dying
[00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:38.653]  Then Marvin Hagler probably wouldn't have died and many, many others.
[00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:40.194]  Because remember, he's famous.
[00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:41.194]  He's a world champion.
[00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:44.476]  The average person in a nursing home getting killed, you're not hearing about.
[00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:46.757]  Most nursing homes are in on it, they're not reporting it.
[00:12:46.757 --> 00:12:49.778]  But the ones that do are like, yeah, we got 50 people, 3 died.
[00:12:49.778 --> 00:12:51.679]  We got 100 people, 10 died.
[00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:53.580]  We've got 200 nuns, 15 died.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.161]  I mean, these are the numbers coming out.
[00:12:56.161 --> 00:13:00.363]  Large numbers of old people die within hours or days of taking it.
[00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:01.344]  This is euthanasia.
[00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:07.492]  And Bill Gates runs this whole thing and famously said, get rid of old people.
[00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:08.833]  To quote, save money.
[00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:09.633]  It's eugenics.
[00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:13.777]  It's teaching you to have no heart, to have no soul, and to not value your humanity.
[00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:16.980]  And once you don't value your humanity, the globalists can take your rights as well.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.842]  We need to come together and defend each other's freedoms.
[00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:26.108]  That's why they're dividing us along race, and religion, and sex, and all this crap because it's an anti-human globalist takeover.
[00:13:26.508 --> 00:13:30.269]  We've all got our differences, but we also have the globalists out to get all of us.
[00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.649]  So that should unify us against the new world order.
[00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:36.970]  And InfoWars stands steadfastly here as a beacon of truth, warning the world.
[00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:45.052]  So remember, all of you, spread the word tonight about this broadcast and what really happened to Hank Aaron, to Marvelous Marvin, and so many others.
[00:13:45.052 --> 00:13:47.152]  God bless, my friends, and good luck.
[00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:50.393]  Now the show's turned over to Owen Schroyer.
[00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:51.733]  From Rockton, Massachusetts,
[00:13:53.544 --> 00:14:10.331]  Punch in the boxing business, or Hagler, is not a good puncher.
[00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:16.174]  Well, as you pointed out before, Hagler is a very strong guy, but he's a clubber.
[00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:21.266]  What do you mean by clever?
[00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:23.929]  Well, he doesn't have that real snap in the punch.
[00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:25.931]  He has strong arms.
[00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.393]  That right hand was a number.
[00:14:37.887 --> 00:14:39.108]  Well, we have 47 seconds to go.
[00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:40.028]  No, it's all over, Gil.
[00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:41.528]  Yeah, it looks that way.
[00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:42.629]  It's all over.
[00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:43.789]  They should stop this fight.
[00:14:43.789 --> 00:14:47.091]  Hagler just looked at the referee and asked him to stop it.
[00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:47.851]  It's all over.
[00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:48.631]  There it is.
[00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:53.233]  He must have lost it just now, but he punched it back in himself.
[00:14:53.233 --> 00:14:56.815]  Warren, a good left hook for a change.
[00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:57.495]  Not another.
[00:14:58.729 --> 00:15:01.792]  We have just been watching some replays of the marvelous Marvin Hagler who
[00:15:25.006 --> 00:15:31.968]  Thomas Hearns, another famous boxer back in the day, first reported Hagler in the ICU after taking COVID vaccines.
[00:15:31.968 --> 00:15:33.168]  Very bad side effects.
[00:15:33.168 --> 00:15:34.048]  Died hours later.
[00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:37.089]  So we're going to have more of that coming up.
[00:15:37.089 --> 00:15:39.630]  You know, it's weird watching old sports.
[00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:51.073]  It's almost sad because old sports were so much more fun and so much more enjoyable and palatable and consumable than what you get nowadays.
[00:15:51.073 --> 00:15:54.174]  It's more fun to watch replays of old sports than anything new.
[00:15:55.646 --> 00:15:58.627]  And it's just a sign of how culture is going.
[00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:21.582]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types, because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:21.822]  Boom!
[00:16:21.822 --> 00:16:22.222]  We did it.
[00:16:22.222 --> 00:16:22.722]  It's popular.
[00:16:22.722 --> 00:16:23.482]  It's X3.
[00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:24.163]  Is it better than X2?
[00:16:24.163 --> 00:16:25.403]  You decide.
[00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:26.864]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:16:26.864 --> 00:16:31.005]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill
[00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:32.625]  Sleep Aid.
[00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:34.046]  And that is down and out.
[00:16:34.046 --> 00:16:35.306]  It's super strong.
[00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:37.187]  Way stronger than knockout.
[00:16:37.187 --> 00:16:38.747]  But they don't compete with each other.
[00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:40.627]  Different strokes for different folks.
[00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:41.428]  Different formulas.

[00:17:00.054 --> 00:17:01.795]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:05.036]  Info Wars has been banned.
[00:17:05.036 --> 00:17:05.957]  Arrested.
[00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.670]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.131]  Because we are effective.
[00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:30.813]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:17:30.813 --> 00:17:33.114]  Go to band.video.
[00:17:33.114 --> 00:17:37.217]  Download the videos and share.
[00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:44.541]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:46.262]  And never give up the fight.
[00:17:55.835 --> 00:18:06.883]  InfoWars.com Every product you hear me on air advertising, we have it stocked in our warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:18:06.883 --> 00:18:08.064]  Every product.
[00:18:08.064 --> 00:18:09.185]  So if you order it, we've got it.
[00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:12.087]  It ships out in a couple days, sometimes the same day.
[00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:19.293]  Leisurers get confused when they hear me talk about the fact that the supply chain is breaking down and it's future orders.
[00:18:19.293 --> 00:18:22.135]  It's product we're trying to reorder to get back in.
[00:18:23.012 --> 00:18:23.972]  That we're having trouble with.
[00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:28.434]  I mean, I'm talking about double, triple, quadruple delivery times.
[00:18:28.434 --> 00:18:33.156]  And it's across, not just the supplement vitamin mineral industry, it's across every industry.
[00:18:33.156 --> 00:18:36.677]  So the globalists have successfully devastated the economy.
[00:18:37.882 --> 00:18:46.165]  That's why I'm saying, you need to visit InfoWareStore.com today and get high quality supplements while you still can and storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.586]  Because we have it in stock, it's ready to ship.
[00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:54.688]  But with the supply chain breakdowns, prices are going up, availability is going down, and it's just crazy.
[00:18:54.688 --> 00:18:57.869]  So please, get products while you still can and support the InfoWare.
[00:18:57.869 --> 00:19:00.730]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.751]  My enemies are your enemies.
[00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:05.192]  They're the globalists, they're the exterminists.
[00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:33.566]  They're a consortium of mad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshippers, vampires, whatever you want to call them, that are highly predatory, and are setting up a false fantasy land system of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs, and electromagnetic radiation to change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn on a chessboard.
[00:19:34.884 --> 00:19:42.170]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the noose is only going to tighten around our necks from here on out.
[00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:59.444]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news, and want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with the New World Order, but at the end of the day, it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the end of the human system as we know it, and all its ashes, a nightmare being built, only admitting it can turn it around and stop it.
[00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:12.867]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.867 --> 00:20:19.430]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.851]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20:21.851 --> 00:20:29.394]  We're gonna get all the news in the next hour and a half here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:29.794]  We've got
[00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:43.671]  Liberal Democrat progressives, the Biden promotion remorse, the Biden voter remorse, the Liberal Party, Democrat Party politic remorse.
[00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:46.212]  You've got more people dropping dead of the vaccine.
[00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:51.716]  They can't hide it anymore, though they deny it.
[00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:53.497]  You've got odd developments now.
[00:20:53.497 --> 00:20:57.940]  I know that we don't care about the royal family, but you see, this is a global
[00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:09.968]  Cabal that we're dealing with and so there's a hint of that with what's going on with Meghan Markle and the fake Prince Harry.
[00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.948]  And so we'll touch on that a little bit.
[00:21:12.948 --> 00:21:19.330]  You have left-wing Democrat terrorism taking place all weekend long.
[00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.191]  Did you even hear about it in the mainstream news?
[00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:24.131]  Across the nation
[00:21:25.262 --> 00:21:37.748]  In the name of Floyd, in the name of Breonna Taylor, in the name of what other mainstream media propaganda they push to get black people to hate police or white people or burn their cities to the ground.
[00:21:37.748 --> 00:21:39.109]  Yeah, it happened all weekend long.
[00:21:39.109 --> 00:21:41.970]  You didn't hear about it though, did you?
[00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.151]  So we've got that coming up.
[00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:47.573]  Meanwhile, you still don't know who shot Ashley Babbitt.
[00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:51.475]  So once again, the big lie of racism and police exposed again.
[00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:54.516]  Well, if it was a white person... Well, what about Ashley Babbitt?
[00:21:55.655 --> 00:22:01.517]  And we don't get to know her shooter executed on film.
[00:22:01.517 --> 00:22:08.779]  But they don't rally, they don't riot, they don't say her name.
[00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:20.963]  But so we'll cover all the left-wing violence coming up and then also you have a woman arrested and and beaten by a police officer for refusing to wear a mask in a Bank of America which is ironic
[00:22:21.684 --> 00:22:34.956]  Since the mask mandate has been lifted here in Texas and I went out this weekend to socialize really for the first time in a while and the streets of Austin were packed.
[00:22:34.956 --> 00:22:37.718]  Hundreds lined up to go into bars.
[00:22:37.718 --> 00:22:39.419]  Some people were still wearing their masks.
[00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:42.983]  I chose not to and was pleasantly never asked to put one on.
[00:22:42.983 --> 00:22:44.444]  Boy, that's nice to be free.
[00:22:44.444 --> 00:22:45.465]  Hey, you want to wear the mask?
[00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:45.705]  Fine.
[00:22:47.273 --> 00:22:50.635]  I don't, my friends don't, and no one bothered us about it, and that's nice.
[00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:51.635]  And guess what?
[00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:57.339]  Of the thousands of people that were out, packed into bars in Austin, Texas this weekend, nobody's gonna get sick.
[00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:01.261]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:23:01.261 --> 00:23:03.762]  We got a vaccine, we gotta sell ya.
[00:23:03.762 --> 00:23:06.464]  We got fear, we gotta sell ya.
[00:23:06.464 --> 00:23:12.607]  We gotta put our boot on your neck, and we have to lie to you via the mainstream media to get you to comply.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.802]  Oh, and also bad news for Andrew Cuomo.
[00:23:17.802 --> 00:23:19.363]  It only gets worse for Cuomo.
[00:23:19.363 --> 00:23:34.409]  And so if you thought the nursing home deaths were going to go away with the six or seven or whatever accusers now we're at of the number of accusers against Cuomo, well, a new ripple in this story has just come about.
[00:23:34.409 --> 00:23:40.292]  It looks like Cuomo was not only sending COVID into the nursing home,
[00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:56.261]  But was also sending COVID into offices, the New York office for people with developmental disabilities, where they have like housing and staffing, taking care of people with disabilities.
[00:23:56.261 --> 00:24:10.846]  It looks like Cuomo also sent people with COVID into there, which once again resulted in, in this case, at least hundreds of deaths and thousands of infections.
[00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:11.907]  So the Cuomo
[00:24:12.757 --> 00:24:15.858]  Legacy just gets worse.
[00:24:15.858 --> 00:24:22.781]  But how about Marvelous Marvin Hagler, dead after receiving a COVID vaccine?
[00:24:22.781 --> 00:24:25.542]  Now, now, let's be clear about something.
[00:24:25.542 --> 00:24:27.143]  You want to know there's an agenda.
[00:24:27.143 --> 00:24:31.265]  You want to know there's a narrative.
[00:24:31.265 --> 00:24:33.006]  You want to know the signs.
[00:24:33.006 --> 00:24:36.987]  So, tell me how this works.
[00:24:36.987 --> 00:24:38.548]  Every person that dies
[00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.213]  They look for any reason to say that that death was from COVID.
[00:24:44.213 --> 00:24:45.594]  Well, why would that be?
[00:24:45.594 --> 00:24:52.800]  Well, the hospitals get $12,000 payouts for having COVID positive patients, and then they get a bonus $49,000.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.065]  This is just kind of the average of what these hospitals are making.
[00:24:58.065 --> 00:25:00.887]  This is all confirmed by doctors and everything.
[00:25:00.887 --> 00:25:06.872]  And then you can get about $49,000 if you put them on ventilators, which may blow their lungs out and kill them.
[00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:07.552]  You get the payday.
[00:25:07.552 --> 00:25:08.253]  It doesn't matter to you.
[00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:10.346]  So everything is COVID.
[00:25:10.346 --> 00:25:11.247]  The flu is COVID.
[00:25:11.247 --> 00:25:12.087]  Pneumonia is COVID.
[00:25:12.087 --> 00:25:13.867]  Cancer is COVID.
[00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:15.507]  Lou Gehrig's disease is COVID.
[00:25:15.507 --> 00:25:17.428]  Run over by a car is COVID.
[00:25:17.428 --> 00:25:19.168]  Shoot yourself in the head is COVID.
[00:25:19.168 --> 00:25:20.008]  It's all COVID.
[00:25:20.008 --> 00:25:22.269]  And the hospitals get the payout, so they don't mind.
[00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:25.009]  Yeah, sure, this person came in with multiple gunshot wounds.
[00:25:25.009 --> 00:25:25.790]  COVID.
[00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.990]  And that's a common story.
[00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.350]  Just look at the Denver death counts.
[00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.010]  Look at all of them.
[00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:34.671]  So it's always COVID, no matter what, because there's an agenda there.
[00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:37.132]  Well, how about, look at the response with the vaccine.
[00:25:37.734 --> 00:25:39.135]  Well it's the truth.
[00:25:39.135 --> 00:25:43.256]  Hank Aaron got the vaccine and then unexpectedly died.
[00:25:43.256 --> 00:25:49.699]  It's true that Marvelous Marvin Hagler got the vaccine and then within hours died.
[00:25:49.699 --> 00:25:51.099]  That's just true.
[00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.120]  Both unexpected deaths.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.542]  They don't know why they died and why won't they even mention the vaccine because see that's part of the agenda.
[00:25:58.542 --> 00:26:04.805]  So the agenda was everything's COVID but with the vaccine nothing is the vaccine.
[00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:05.025]  That's
[00:26:05.985 --> 00:26:16.454]  Clear and present evidence that there is an agenda afoot when that's the dichotomy of the coverage and the approach to these two different circumstances.
[00:26:16.454 --> 00:26:19.477]  Everything's COVID, nothing is ever the vaccine.
[00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:26.303]  It doesn't matter that Bill Gates admits there's going to be thousands of people that have negative side effects or hundreds of thousands.
[00:26:26.303 --> 00:26:26.883]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:26.883 --> 00:26:27.824]  He admits that on TV.
[00:26:27.824 --> 00:26:29.766]  The main guy pushing this, he's the main advocate.
[00:26:29.766 --> 00:26:30.226]  Why?
[00:26:30.226 --> 00:26:30.847]  I don't know.
[00:26:30.847 --> 00:26:31.908]  I guess you could take a guess.
[00:26:33.271 --> 00:26:37.374]  Or you could just listen to his own speech at TED Talk saying he wants all humans to die.
[00:26:37.374 --> 00:26:38.795]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing.
[00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:47.080]  He said he only wants carbon emissions down to zero, which in his mathematical formula that he puts on the board that had P in it representing people, he said that had to get to zero.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.002]  But, you know, just paraphrasing, he wants you dead.
[00:26:50.002 --> 00:27:02.550]  So he promotes the vaccine and then Fauci in an incredible interview with a Mexican comedian actor admits in the live interview
[00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:16.216]  Just what InfoWars has been saying, this is not a vaccine, this is a brand new science, this is a brand new technology, biotechnology never been used before, we're testing it on you humans right now.
[00:27:16.216 --> 00:27:25.260]  I don't want to play the video because I aired it a hundred times on Friday, but the full video is at Band.Video and in stories, just linked in the stories at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:27.532 --> 00:27:30.754]  But then Fauci has the nerve to come out the next day.
[00:27:30.754 --> 00:27:48.127]  So after Fauci says, this is an experimental technology, it's not even a vaccine, we're testing it on humans right now for the first time, in a live interview he admits all of that, making InfoWars next year's news today, and then the next day he comes out and he says it's disturbing
[00:27:48.797 --> 00:27:53.279]  That Trump voters are skeptical of the experimental mRNA vaccine.
[00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:57.020]  Oh, it's disturbing that we're free thinkers to Anthony Fauci.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.821]  It's disturbing that we believe we have medical freedom of choice.
[00:28:00.821 --> 00:28:02.662]  That's disturbing to Anthony Fauci.
[00:28:02.662 --> 00:28:06.123]  See, he wants everybody to roll up that sleeve and take that jab.
[00:28:06.123 --> 00:28:11.965]  He's a medical tyrant.
[00:28:11.965 --> 00:28:14.706]  And then he's urging that Trump
[00:28:15.692 --> 00:28:18.493]  Tells his supporters to get the COVID vaccine.
[00:28:18.493 --> 00:28:21.034]  Oh, that's not scary at all.
[00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:22.634]  So let me get this straight.
[00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:26.096]  A virus so deadly, I don't even know I have it.
[00:28:26.096 --> 00:28:31.538]  And a vaccine so effective and efficient that you have to force me to take it.
[00:28:31.538 --> 00:28:32.998]  Hmm.
[00:28:32.998 --> 00:28:36.279]  Something doesn't add up there.
[00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:38.080]  Something seems to be missing there.
[00:28:40.183 --> 00:28:45.888]  And then he admits it's an untested science and we have all these people dying after they take the vaccine.
[00:28:45.888 --> 00:28:47.289]  Hmm.
[00:28:47.289 --> 00:28:49.291]  Hmm.
[00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:53.394]  Common sense and logic would say, I don't trust Fauci.
[00:28:53.394 --> 00:28:55.295]  I don't trust the vaccine.
[00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:56.777]  And I'm still alive.
[00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:59.479]  And the death count hasn't changed in the deadliest pandemic ever, huh?
[00:29:00.137 --> 00:29:08.385]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test.
[00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:14.410]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:23.298]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out in the third dimension, so we can decide where we want to spend eternity, and what level we want to go to.
[00:29:23.298 --> 00:29:24.540]  And it really does come down to that.
[00:29:25.738 --> 00:29:33.127]  As sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[00:29:33.127 --> 00:29:36.752]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[00:29:36.752 --> 00:29:38.955]  God is the author of us having free will.
[00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:43.028]  And that free will is a beautiful thing.
[00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:52.395]  When you look at mainstream media and Hollywood and this whole evil culture and Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[00:29:52.395 --> 00:29:55.177]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad.
[00:29:55.177 --> 00:29:59.180]  Because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:08.633]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:09.514]  It is Down and Out.
[00:30:09.514 --> 00:30:11.337]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[00:30:11.337 --> 00:30:14.321]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:14.982]  It's got four
[00:30:15.162 --> 00:30:15.462]  I think so.
[00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:40.388]  If you take it sublingually under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off to sleep?
[00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:41.088]  It's incredible.
[00:30:41.088 --> 00:30:46.112]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest that's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:02.061]  The people are awakening.
[00:31:02.061 --> 00:31:04.785]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:31:04.785 --> 00:31:06.868]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:31:06.868 --> 00:31:09.211]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:15.861]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:27.428]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:31:27.428 --> 00:31:34.152]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:31:34.152 --> 00:31:35.573]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:31:35.573 --> 00:31:39.996]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:31:40.476 --> 00:31:42.437]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:43.497]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:31:43.497 --> 00:31:45.197]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:31:45.197 --> 00:31:47.198]  They work absolutely great.
[00:31:47.198 --> 00:31:56.341]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[00:31:56.341 --> 00:32:00.062]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:32:00.062 --> 00:32:03.483]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:07.089]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:09.713]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[00:32:09.713 --> 00:32:12.697]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:16.321]  That's why Jesus said, My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:32:16.321 --> 00:32:18.625]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:25.507]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:32:25.507 --> 00:32:28.668]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[00:32:28.668 --> 00:32:29.768]  Because it's so simple.
[00:32:29.768 --> 00:32:31.749]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:40.632]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:32:46.093 --> 00:32:47.394]  No other product you can buy does that.
[00:32:48.394 --> 00:32:50.317]  So again, InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:50.317 --> 00:32:52.379]  It's back in stock, 50% off.

[00:32:55.864 --> 00:33:03.233]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:05.897]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.974 --> 00:33:28.856]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:30.938]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.938 --> 00:33:33.839]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:41.083]  Alright, let me bear down and focus on the latest vaccine news and the Marvin Hagler story.
[00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:51.848]  So, let me just, again, revert to the big news from last week, if you haven't seen this, where Anthony Fauci admits in a live interview
[00:33:52.944 --> 00:33:54.526]  That this is not a vaccine.
[00:33:54.526 --> 00:33:57.849]  This is experimental mRNA gene therapy.
[00:33:57.849 --> 00:33:58.849]  It's never been tested.
[00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:03.093]  I mean, he said, he's like, the good news is so far it's not been so bad!
[00:34:03.093 --> 00:34:05.475]  The good news is!
[00:34:05.475 --> 00:34:07.998]  Well, pretty bad for Aunt Karen and his family.
[00:34:07.998 --> 00:34:10.320]  Pretty bad for the nurse in
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.122]  Las Vegas and everywhere else and all the people that have died from it.
[00:34:14.122 --> 00:34:15.584]  So, you know, it kind of sucks for them, though.
[00:34:15.584 --> 00:34:16.885]  But for Fauci, it's been good.
[00:34:16.885 --> 00:34:18.586]  I mean, the numbers are pretty good.
[00:34:18.586 --> 00:34:22.409]  For a worldwide human experiment with a brand new technology, only thousands dead.
[00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.450]  That's not bad.
[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.091]  That's not bad.
[00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:31.236]  Sure, we rebranded the flu as fear porn for COVID to put you in fear.
[00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:31.937]  But you know what?
[00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:33.719]  Only thousands of you have died.
[00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:34.779]  So it's not so bad.
[00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:35.360]  It's pretty good.
[00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:37.576]  And he says it all in the interview.
[00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:38.197]  It's shocking.
[00:34:38.197 --> 00:34:42.879]  It's like, if you take what he says at face value, I mean, he just admitted all of it.
[00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:44.239]  But you know, it doesn't make headlines.
[00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:45.020]  Nobody blinks an eye.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.381]  It's whatever.
[00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:49.822]  So Fauci admits it's experimental.
[00:34:49.822 --> 00:34:57.905]  He admits it's also not even effective, because you get the vaccine, you still have to wear the mask, you still have to socially distance, you still can't go to school and church, because they don't know.
[00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:59.186]  It's in the trial phase.
[00:34:59.186 --> 00:34:59.626]  They don't know.
[00:34:59.626 --> 00:35:00.607]  Maybe you can still spread it.
[00:35:00.607 --> 00:35:01.527]  Maybe you can still get it.
[00:35:01.527 --> 00:35:02.547]  Maybe you can still die from it.
[00:35:02.547 --> 00:35:03.688]  Maybe it'll be worse when you get it.
[00:35:03.688 --> 00:35:04.488]  They don't know.
[00:35:04.488 --> 00:35:05.769]  It's all being tested right now.
[00:35:06.758 --> 00:35:22.567]  And he admits it, but see, he's so arrogant, he's such a medical tyrant, that he's disturbed that Trump voters are skeptical of taking the vaccine and don't want to, and he's urging Trump to tell his supporters to take the vaccine.
[00:35:22.567 --> 00:35:27.490]  That's not going to go well, and Trump's not going to do it.
[00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.891]  At least, I hope, it'd be a bad move politically.
[00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:41.612]  You'd think it'd be a bad move, you know, just across the board politically to say, hey, I'm introducing medical tyranny, big pharma tyranny.
[00:35:41.612 --> 00:35:44.594]  You have to take this big pharmaceutical product.
[00:35:44.594 --> 00:35:46.254]  You have to consume it.
[00:35:46.254 --> 00:35:47.995]  It's freedom.
[00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:50.536]  Or if you want to be free again, just do as I say.
[00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:52.977]  That's freedom, folks, don't you know?
[00:35:52.977 --> 00:35:58.059]  Freedom in the 21st century under Fauci and Gates and Biden.
[00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:00.400]  Do what I say and you can be free.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.121]  Oh, that's nice.
[00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:32.414]  So now, Marvin Hagler, marvelous Marvin Hagler, a world-famous boxer, champion boxer, gets the vaccine hours later in the ICU fighting the side effects, and it ends up being Thomas Hearns, who was a famous boxer as well back in the day, a champion boxer in his own right, said
[00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:42.305]  Hagler's in ICU fighting the side effects of the vaccine and then, of course, Marvin Hagler dies.
[00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:53.592]  And so the media has to rush, the media owned by Big Pharma has to rush to cover this up, has to rush to set the narrative straight.
[00:36:53.592 --> 00:36:55.693]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:55.693 --> 00:36:58.274]  Don't you mention that he took the vaccine.
[00:36:58.274 --> 00:36:59.475]  That's in bad taste.
[00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.966]  Don't you dare mention that.
[00:37:02.966 --> 00:37:04.787]  Somebody gets shot in Denver, Colorado.
[00:37:04.787 --> 00:37:06.307]  Somebody gets run over in New York.
[00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:07.508]  They die to COVID.
[00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:11.730]  But you don't dare mention that Hagler got the vaccine hours before he died.
[00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.091]  You don't dare bring that up.
[00:37:14.091 --> 00:37:14.671]  Mmm.
[00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:18.573]  Fauci's very upset with you.
[00:37:18.573 --> 00:37:20.853]  And then here come the headlines.
[00:37:20.853 --> 00:37:23.054]  Anti-vaxxers try to hijack.
[00:37:23.054 --> 00:37:23.615]  Hijack?
[00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:25.635]  We're hijacking the death.
[00:37:25.635 --> 00:37:26.976]  I've hijacked his death, folks.
[00:37:26.976 --> 00:37:27.596]  I've hijacked it.
[00:37:27.596 --> 00:37:28.136]  I've stolen it.
[00:37:28.136 --> 00:37:28.817]  It's mine now.
[00:37:28.817 --> 00:37:29.357]  My death.
[00:37:30.345 --> 00:37:33.026]  No, Marvin Hagler died from the vaccine.
[00:37:33.026 --> 00:37:35.447]  That's not me hijacking the death.
[00:37:35.447 --> 00:37:38.188]  That's the New World Order hijacking his life.
[00:37:38.188 --> 00:37:41.849]  That's the New World Order hijacking him and killing him.
[00:37:41.849 --> 00:37:47.131]  But it's all a global population control agenda.
[00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:54.333]  Anti-vaxxers try to hijack the death of boxing legend Marvin Hagler, falsely claiming he died from vaccine side effects.
[00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:55.274]  Falsely claiming!
[00:37:55.274 --> 00:37:58.255]  How do you know?
[00:37:58.255 --> 00:37:59.015]  You don't know.
[00:38:00.018 --> 00:38:01.839]  You're owned by Big Pharmaceutical.
[00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:04.900]  You are paid fake news.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.061]  You're scum!
[00:38:07.061 --> 00:38:11.483]  We... You can't... We... Falsely claiming.
[00:38:11.483 --> 00:38:15.705]  Falsely claiming, but you don't know.
[00:38:15.705 --> 00:38:21.668]  And, I mean, the crazy thing is, like, they interview his family, they talk to Hearns, and they're like, yeah, he just got the vaccine and immediately died.
[00:38:21.668 --> 00:38:23.849]  Like, yeah, this was out of nowhere.
[00:38:23.849 --> 00:38:24.789]  We had no idea.
[00:38:24.789 --> 00:38:25.809]  Oh, he was in great health.
[00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:26.910]  This was so unexpected.
[00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:29.884]  So what was the difference?
[00:38:29.884 --> 00:38:32.406]  What was the variable?
[00:38:32.406 --> 00:38:33.067]  The vaccine.
[00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:33.607]  Whoa!
[00:38:33.607 --> 00:38:36.449]  Shh!
[00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:40.613]  Hey, whoa, hey, look, listen.
[00:38:40.613 --> 00:38:43.835]  We got a global extermination thing going here, OK?
[00:38:43.835 --> 00:38:50.841]  And we got this new trial biotechnology that we want to test on humans before we give ourselves the real stuff.
[00:38:50.841 --> 00:38:54.043]  And so, you know, maybe just not mention the vaccine.
[00:38:54.043 --> 00:38:54.544]  Just don't even.
[00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.149]  You know what I mean?
[00:38:56.149 --> 00:38:58.591]  And just don't publish any headlines about that either.
[00:38:58.591 --> 00:39:02.454]  And if you do, just attack the people that would even mention the vaccine.
[00:39:02.454 --> 00:39:06.918]  And please, don't bring up that he got the vaccine hours before he died either.
[00:39:06.918 --> 00:39:07.839]  Don't.
[00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:08.700]  You don't want to do that.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:14.105]  We're running a very, very important worldwide experiment right now on you.
[00:39:14.105 --> 00:39:16.687]  So you just don't want to mention that vaccine.
[00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:17.347]  All right?
[00:39:17.347 --> 00:39:19.730]  It's just not a good idea for you.
[00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.251]  So he didn't die of the vaccine.
[00:39:22.848 --> 00:39:27.972]  Even though we don't know what he died of and it was all very suspicious right after the vaccine and unexpected.
[00:39:27.972 --> 00:39:29.793]  But do not mention that vaccine.
[00:39:29.793 --> 00:39:30.714]  You can't do it.
[00:39:30.714 --> 00:39:34.877]  And if you do, you're hijacking his death.
[00:39:34.877 --> 00:39:38.320]  Even though you hijacked his life when you killed him with the vaccine.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:46.906]  And so here's the amazing thing, because I don't know if my dad had heard about Marvin Hagler's death, but he tuned in today and he's like, oh, Marvin Hagler.
[00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:49.908]  I was a big fan of him.
[00:39:49.908 --> 00:39:50.989]  Back in boxing's heyday.
[00:39:52.378 --> 00:39:55.699]  And I said, yep, they got him with the vaccine.
[00:39:55.699 --> 00:40:00.681]  And he responded and he said, no, they got him with the propaganda first.
[00:40:00.681 --> 00:40:04.663]  And that is so key to all of this.
[00:40:04.663 --> 00:40:09.925]  That's why InfoWars is on air, folks.
[00:40:09.925 --> 00:40:12.286]  That's like the sword that we wield.
[00:40:12.286 --> 00:40:15.447]  That's like the ultimate burden.
[00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:19.008]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda to be afraid of COVID.
[00:40:19.008 --> 00:40:20.829]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda
[00:40:21.747 --> 00:40:22.728]  To be afraid of the flu.
[00:40:22.728 --> 00:40:35.318]  We don't want you to fall for the propaganda to go out there and take a potentially deadly, never been tested on humans before, DNA modification therapy vaccine.
[00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:38.580]  So we're combating their propaganda and that's the battle.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:46.707]  Hey, we're wielding our sword of truth versus the sword of the corrupt deep state, secret government, whatever you want to call it, mainstream news.
[00:40:46.707 --> 00:40:48.268]  Well, they got Hagler.
[00:40:48.268 --> 00:40:49.549]  They won that battle.
[00:40:49.549 --> 00:40:50.690]  And now Hagler's soul
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.942]  Hopefully he's in heaven with the Creator.
[00:40:55.942 --> 00:40:57.703]  But so, see, this is the propaganda.
[00:40:57.703 --> 00:40:59.244]  Oh, Obama took the shot!
[00:40:59.244 --> 00:41:00.724]  George Bush took the shot!
[00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:03.206]  Don't you know, all your famous celebs took the shot!
[00:41:03.206 --> 00:41:06.347]  Of course, they're probably not actually getting the shot.
[00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:08.108]  It's probably a fake shot.
[00:41:08.108 --> 00:41:10.909]  Or, like, a... I forget where it was.
[00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:11.590]  It was some hospital.
[00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.851]  Someone's like, okay, fine, we'll force all our people to get a shot.
[00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:15.432]  And then they just gave them nothing.
[00:41:15.432 --> 00:41:16.172]  It was fake.
[00:41:16.172 --> 00:41:16.732]  They admitted it.
[00:41:16.732 --> 00:41:18.173]  They're like, yeah, we faked giving them the shot.
[00:41:18.173 --> 00:41:19.514]  We don't actually want them to take the shot.
[00:41:19.514 --> 00:41:19.954]  It's deadly.
[00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.313]  But see, there's the propaganda.
[00:41:23.313 --> 00:41:24.553]  Oh, be afraid of COVID.
[00:41:24.553 --> 00:41:25.774]  Be deathly afraid of COVID.
[00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:27.254]  It's the deadliest thing ever.
[00:41:27.254 --> 00:41:29.495]  Oh boy, I'm really afraid of COVID.
[00:41:29.495 --> 00:41:31.656]  Then they crash your economy.
[00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.598]  And now that they have you in fear, in the grips of fear.
[00:41:34.598 --> 00:41:36.018]  See, look, that woman didn't even get a vaccine.
[00:41:36.018 --> 00:41:37.519]  It's all fake.
[00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:39.180]  They know the damn thing's deadly.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.080]  There's nothing even in it.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.121]  They don't even try to fake it good.
[00:41:42.121 --> 00:41:44.662]  They think you're that stupid.
[00:41:44.662 --> 00:41:47.303]  And for most, sadly for most people, they are.
[00:41:47.303 --> 00:41:49.084]  Not you in this audience, obviously, but
[00:41:52.483 --> 00:41:56.705]  So, you see how it works?
[00:41:56.705 --> 00:41:57.286]  It's true, though.
[00:41:57.286 --> 00:42:07.812]  They hit you with the propaganda first, and then once you accept it, once you consume it, then you'll do anything they want.
[00:42:07.812 --> 00:42:16.056]  You'll do a swab up your nose, you'll do a swab up your butt, just to see if you got COVID, which is 99.99999% survivable.
[00:42:19.784 --> 00:42:21.885]  So the big lie, they know it's going to kill you if you get it.
[00:42:21.885 --> 00:42:22.565]  That was a big lie.
[00:42:22.565 --> 00:42:23.806]  That doesn't matter now.
[00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:27.748]  The big lie of all these cases, it turns out the tests were fraudulent.
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:30.149]  No, that doesn't matter now.
[00:42:30.149 --> 00:42:32.470]  The big lie, it's the deadliest pandemic ever.
[00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.411]  Death rate didn't go up a single percent.
[00:42:34.411 --> 00:42:35.692]  Now the big lie.
[00:42:35.692 --> 00:42:40.554]  After they sold you that big lie and you bought that big lie, now the big lie is the vaccine is safe and effective.
[00:42:40.554 --> 00:42:42.095]  No, it's killing thousands of people.
[00:42:42.095 --> 00:42:43.975]  They even admit it.
[00:42:43.975 --> 00:42:45.016]  That's just what we know of.
[00:42:45.757 --> 00:42:47.339]  That it's killing thousands of people.
[00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:48.601]  So that's the next big lie.
[00:42:48.601 --> 00:42:53.047]  So that's why InfoWars is here to fight that propaganda.
[00:42:53.047 --> 00:42:55.771]  I would not get that vaccine, folks.
[00:42:55.771 --> 00:42:59.816]  And I would never live in fear of a TV media narrative.
[00:42:59.816 --> 00:43:03.481]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[00:43:04.705 --> 00:43:06.726]  People ask me all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine?
[00:43:06.726 --> 00:43:07.806]  Are you on meth?
[00:43:07.806 --> 00:43:09.187]  How are you so excited?
[00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:12.008]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[00:43:12.008 --> 00:43:12.928]  Forced masks.
[00:43:12.928 --> 00:43:15.049]  Forced inoculations.
[00:43:15.049 --> 00:43:18.010]  Open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.251]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:20.371]  I'm a fighter.
[00:43:20.371 --> 00:43:23.052]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[00:43:23.052 --> 00:43:25.233]  And so I'll just say this.
[00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:26.253]  I try to be calm.
[00:43:26.253 --> 00:43:28.014]  I try to be focused.
[00:43:28.014 --> 00:43:30.215]  And I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't still on air right now.
[00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:35.222]  But I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:43:35.222 --> 00:43:40.323]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the InfoWar, that's not me patting you on the head.
[00:43:40.323 --> 00:43:44.044]  You are 99% of the equation.
[00:43:44.044 --> 00:43:51.786]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, InfoWarStore.com, when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[00:43:51.786 --> 00:43:53.987]  So, you are the InfoWar.
[00:43:53.987 --> 00:43:55.607]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[00:43:55.607 --> 00:43:56.887]  Thank you for all you've done.
[00:43:56.887 --> 00:43:59.328]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalists.
[00:43:59.728 --> 00:44:03.670]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.311]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:07.052]  Why do you do that?
[00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:09.993]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[00:44:09.993 --> 00:44:20.958]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:44:21.594 --> 00:44:21.854]  Boom!
[00:44:21.854 --> 00:44:22.234]  We did it.
[00:44:22.234 --> 00:44:22.734]  It's popular.
[00:44:22.734 --> 00:44:23.514]  It's X3.
[00:44:23.514 --> 00:44:24.175]  Is it better than X2?
[00:44:24.175 --> 00:44:25.415]  You decide.
[00:44:25.415 --> 00:44:26.875]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:32.657]  Well, now we have a compliment to Knockout, our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[00:44:32.657 --> 00:44:34.077]  And that is down and out.
[00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:35.337]  It's super strong.
[00:44:35.337 --> 00:44:37.218]  Way stronger than Knockout.
[00:44:37.218 --> 00:44:38.778]  But they don't compete with each other.
[00:44:38.778 --> 00:44:40.658]  Different strokes for different folks.
[00:44:40.658 --> 00:44:41.458]  Different formulas.
[00:44:41.458 --> 00:44:43.119]  And it's 40% off.
[00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:43.619]  Out of the gates.
[00:44:44.079 --> 00:44:45.779]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[00:44:45.779 --> 00:44:46.960]  It's very bittersweet.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.660]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.380]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.621]  But I don't care about that.
[00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:53.881]  I care about beating the new world order.
[00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:16.316]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[00:45:16.316 --> 00:45:19.681]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.203]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[00:45:21.203 --> 00:45:22.384]  But let's just say this.
[00:45:22.384 --> 00:45:23.706]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[00:45:23.706 --> 00:45:26.190]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.432]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at mfulworthstore.com.
[00:45:30.432 --> 00:45:33.013]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:36.194]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:37.055]  Do they fund freedom?
[00:45:37.055 --> 00:45:38.155]  No, a lot of them don't.
[00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:44.618]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[00:45:44.618 --> 00:45:46.339]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:49.180]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air.
[00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:52.867]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[00:45:52.867 --> 00:46:00.022]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[00:46:00.746 --> 00:46:04.350]  Humanity has been domesticated, by and large.
[00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:08.895]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[00:46:08.895 --> 00:46:18.124]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[00:46:18.124 --> 00:46:22.249]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:40.104]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[00:46:40.684 --> 00:46:56.508]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[00:46:56.508 --> 00:47:03.430]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalist.
[00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.071]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.789 --> 00:47:21.930]  Big Brother.
[00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.711]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:23.711 --> 00:47:25.592]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:27.313]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:27.313 --> 00:47:28.974]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:28.974 --> 00:47:34.078]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.078 --> 00:47:39.421]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:39.421 --> 00:47:42.203]  So, in Texas last week,
[00:47:45.242 --> 00:48:00.185]  The governor of Texas revoked a mandate that he never had the legal right to enforce, or anybody to enforce anyway, of forcing you to wear a face mask and breathe in your own carbon dioxide emissions.
[00:48:00.185 --> 00:48:06.286]  Totally unhealthy, plus the mask spreads disease, but I digress.
[00:48:06.286 --> 00:48:13.627]  So it's been a bit of a bugaboo here in town with the mask thing, and specifically across the state of Texas.
[00:48:13.627 --> 00:48:14.487]  And so you have a woman
[00:48:15.791 --> 00:48:20.097]  That was arrested because she refused to wear a mask at a Bank of America.
[00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:31.791]  So now it's just become the globalist corporations enforcing the corporate government versus the actual will of you, the individual, the sovereign citizen, or even the will now of your local government.
[00:48:31.791 --> 00:48:33.674]  So this is the introduction of the corporate government.
[00:48:36.098 --> 00:48:39.880]  The same people own everything and they are forcing you to wear a mask.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.823]  They were behind the fake pandemic, they own the media, and now they own all the corporations.
[00:48:44.823 --> 00:48:47.104]  So they're going to force you to wear a mask.
[00:48:47.104 --> 00:48:57.669]  And so now you have to find out where you can go in town that's not going to make you wear the face diaper and muzzle you and let you breathe clean air or at least have the option.
[00:48:57.669 --> 00:49:00.451]  And so here is the report from Galveston, Texas where a
[00:49:01.207 --> 00:49:08.533]  Nice lady, refuses to wear a face mask, stands up herself, and then gets arrested on the ground by police.
[00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:12.236]  This is one of the most pathetic things about the media here locally in Texas.
[00:49:12.236 --> 00:49:14.037]  Put that screen back up, guys.
[00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:15.959]  They love promoting the mask.
[00:49:15.959 --> 00:49:16.459]  I don't get it.
[00:49:16.459 --> 00:49:17.600]  I really don't get it.
[00:49:30.282 --> 00:49:31.602]  And here's what it comes down to.
[00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:38.545]  It used to be that, you know, street reporters and journalists, we, you know, it used to be they like to get their hands dirty.
[00:49:38.545 --> 00:49:41.066]  They like to go against the grain.
[00:49:41.066 --> 00:49:42.826]  That was kind of what separated them.
[00:49:42.826 --> 00:49:44.927]  That, you know, they were rebellious in a way.
[00:49:44.927 --> 00:49:51.049]  Now it's the most conformist industry in the world is being a media reporter.
[00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:55.469]  That's why InfoWars stands out above the rest, because we're the least conformist.
[00:49:55.469 --> 00:49:58.490]  When everyone else is a total conformist, we're the exact opposite.
[00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:04.272]  So you'll notice all the local news stations here in Austin and in Texas, they love the mask.
[00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:05.972]  They love promoting COVID.
[00:50:05.972 --> 00:50:07.433]  It's their number one story every night.
[00:50:07.433 --> 00:50:11.874]  And it's so bad, they have the mask in their logo.
[00:50:11.874 --> 00:50:12.594]  Put it back on screen.
[00:50:12.594 --> 00:50:16.155]  The mask is in their logo.
[00:50:16.155 --> 00:50:17.716]  How pathetic is that?
[00:50:17.716 --> 00:50:18.756]  So let's go back to the report.
[00:50:19.821 --> 00:50:27.784]  Yeah, Christine, we spoke with a woman at the center of all this, but first, I want to show you guys the compelling body camera footage of the incidents.
[00:50:27.784 --> 00:50:28.764]  Compelling.
[00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:30.245]  A woman dares to be free.
[00:50:30.245 --> 00:50:33.406]  This is what they do to you.
[00:50:33.406 --> 00:50:41.049]  Detectives say yesterday, 65-year-old Terry Wright chose not to wear a mask inside of a Bank of America that requires one.
[00:50:41.049 --> 00:50:45.191]  This is how the situation ended, but let's go back to where things started.
[00:50:45.191 --> 00:50:46.171]  If that's you, leave.
[00:50:46.171 --> 00:50:46.971]  You have to leave.
[00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:48.492]  That's a police officer talking.
[00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:51.414]  My money is in the bank and I'm going to take it out.
[00:50:51.414 --> 00:50:55.418]  Then the pair argued over whether the bank was a private or public place.
[00:50:55.418 --> 00:50:58.961]  Wright claimed it was public and she didn't have to wear a mask.
[00:50:58.961 --> 00:51:02.123]  Ma'am, listen, we're gonna do this the easy way or the hard way.
[00:51:02.123 --> 00:51:03.445]  What are you gonna do, arrest me?
[00:51:03.445 --> 00:51:05.506]  Yes, for intruding on premises.
[00:51:05.506 --> 00:51:06.787]  That's hilarious.
[00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:08.829]  Let's fast forward a couple seconds.
[00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:13.453]  Now the officer is telling Wright he wants her to go outside and pulls out his handcuffs.
[00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:15.455]  That's when things escalated.
[00:51:15.455 --> 00:51:16.616]  Do not touch me!
[00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:28.101]  So she's trying to leave the building.
[00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:28.782]  She's cooperative.
[00:51:28.782 --> 00:51:29.762]  She's nice.
[00:51:29.762 --> 00:51:31.383]  Oh, by the way, it's such a deadly pandemic.
[00:51:31.383 --> 00:51:32.463]  Guys, go back to the video.
[00:51:32.463 --> 00:51:35.145]  Such a deadly pandemic, you know, six feet of social distance, wear the mask.
[00:51:35.145 --> 00:51:40.727]  But the officer has no problem mauling her, mauling her in this Bank of America.
[00:51:40.727 --> 00:51:42.348]  Oh, what happened to social distance?
[00:51:42.348 --> 00:51:43.028]  She doesn't have a mask.
[00:51:43.028 --> 00:51:43.949]  Are you going to die from COVID?
[00:51:43.949 --> 00:51:44.929]  No, it's all fake.
[00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:46.390]  But you still enforce the law anyway.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:52.421]  So it's going to be real tough to do back the blue the more you see this, because this is pathetic.
[00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:54.841]  This officer is pathetic.
[00:51:54.841 --> 00:51:57.102]  What a sad excuse for a man.
[00:51:57.102 --> 00:52:04.543]  Arresting a 65-year-old lady because she darespeaks the truth and live her own life.
[00:52:04.543 --> 00:52:06.523]  So guys, go back to the point where she's getting arrested.
[00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:09.444]  And she's in there telling the people, like, hey, the mask is stupid.
[00:52:09.444 --> 00:52:10.104]  Why are we doing this?
[00:52:10.104 --> 00:52:10.904]  Take your mask off.
[00:52:10.904 --> 00:52:15.565]  And look at the pathetic American standing there letting this woman be harassed.
[00:52:16.164 --> 00:52:18.465]  By a police officer.
[00:52:18.465 --> 00:52:18.965]  Pathetic.
[00:52:18.965 --> 00:52:21.205]  This is just such a pathetic display on so many levels.
[00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:22.206]  Go back to the report.
[00:52:22.206 --> 00:52:25.326]  With one hand behind her back, she had more fights.
[00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:26.167]  Stop resisting.
[00:52:26.167 --> 00:52:26.867]  Stop.
[00:52:26.867 --> 00:52:32.028]  Eventually, she did stop and became compliant.
[00:52:32.028 --> 00:52:34.109]  That's when things got a little weird.
[00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.889]  Are you trying to speak Spanish to people?
[00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:36.969]  I do speak Spanish.
[00:52:36.969 --> 00:52:38.050]  Okay, well stand up.
[00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:41.431]  And she did stand up and was taken away in a cop car.
[00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:41.991]  I think?
[00:52:43.031 --> 00:52:47.053]  Wearing a mask is absolutely ridiculous, so I don't know why people aren't waking up.
[00:52:47.053 --> 00:52:48.093]  I really don't.
[00:52:48.093 --> 00:52:49.414]  It's a pandemic.
[00:52:49.414 --> 00:52:50.494]  That's Terry Wright.
[00:52:50.494 --> 00:52:52.835]  She's voicing her side of the story.
[00:52:52.835 --> 00:52:54.636]  My civil rights were violated.
[00:52:54.636 --> 00:52:59.578]  I do not, there is no law that says I have to wear a mask.
[00:52:59.578 --> 00:53:00.559]  None whatsoever.
[00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:02.660]  Ah, but there's a corporate government, see?
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.841]  They don't have to write laws.
[00:53:04.841 --> 00:53:06.742]  They rule by fiat, by dictate.
[00:53:06.742 --> 00:53:09.123]  They refuse me access unless I put a face mask on.
[00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:15.213]  And Wright went on to say that every bone in her body now hurts.
[00:53:15.213 --> 00:53:17.075]  Again, Wright has not been arrested.
[00:53:17.075 --> 00:53:19.957]  However, arrest warrants have been filed.
[00:53:19.957 --> 00:53:21.438]  Wow!
[00:53:21.438 --> 00:53:23.400]  We got her!
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.040]  We did it!
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:24.501]  We did it!
[00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:25.882]  Protect and serve!
[00:53:25.882 --> 00:53:28.624]  Alright!
[00:53:28.624 --> 00:53:34.049]  Six feet social distance, but I maul you onto the ground in the Bank of America.
[00:53:34.049 --> 00:53:38.733]  So, Terry Lynn Wright is an American treasure and an American hero.
[00:53:40.248 --> 00:53:41.729]  And she'll probably go to jail for it.
[00:53:41.729 --> 00:53:46.712]  She'll probably get demonized, fired from her job if she has one.
[00:53:46.712 --> 00:53:49.754]  Tormented by local media.
[00:53:49.754 --> 00:53:58.499]  And notice how not a single person stands up to her defense, and they just let this cop manhandle this 65-year-old lady.
[00:53:58.499 --> 00:54:00.099]  These people are pathetic.
[00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:05.102]  And so this is the strangest part, you know, this is one of the stranger things about living in the world.
[00:54:05.102 --> 00:54:07.264]  You think you're walking around with fellow humans.
[00:54:07.264 --> 00:54:07.684]  You're not!
[00:54:10.615 --> 00:54:12.797]  You're not!
[00:54:12.797 --> 00:54:18.503]  You are outnumbered by the brainwashed alien zombie hordes.
[00:54:18.503 --> 00:54:23.828]  And it's events like this that display that sad reality.
[00:54:23.828 --> 00:54:32.115]  There's probably about ten people in that bank, and you have workers, and the security guard, and not a single person comes to this woman's defense.
[00:54:32.115 --> 00:54:33.697]  Not a one.
[00:54:33.697 --> 00:54:34.658]  Not a one.
[00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:36.790]  Talk about customer service.
[00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:41.092]  Nobody can even step up and say, hey, can we just, can we let this lady leave in peace, please?
[00:54:41.092 --> 00:54:43.233]  Nope, they can't even do that.
[00:54:43.233 --> 00:54:44.053]  And don't you love this?
[00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:46.814]  They have, there's your, there's your social distance on the floor.
[00:54:46.814 --> 00:54:53.236]  They've got that little social distance marker on the floor as the cop is manhandling this lady.
[00:54:53.236 --> 00:55:00.058]  No social distance, no gloves on his hand, just grabbing her up and down, pummeling her.
[00:55:00.058 --> 00:55:02.439]  It just shows how the whole thing is theater, folks.
[00:55:02.439 --> 00:55:04.160]  The entire thing is political theater.
[00:55:04.804 --> 00:55:14.073]  And it's being used to take away our freedoms and conquer us and not a single person dares stand up against it.
[00:55:14.073 --> 00:55:18.217]  And you know, this is what I say to people now.
[00:55:18.217 --> 00:55:19.839]  Oh, yeah, I don't want to enforce the mask.
[00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:22.221]  Oh, OK, I'm just doing my job.
[00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:23.142]  You know, there's a famous.
[00:55:23.948 --> 00:55:24.768]  Political movement.
[00:55:24.768 --> 00:55:28.250]  There's a historical group of people that that was the excuse.
[00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:29.150]  What am I thinking of here?
[00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:30.131]  Oh, I'm just doing my job.
[00:55:30.131 --> 00:55:30.731]  I'm just doing my job.
[00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:31.431]  How do we get to that point?
[00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:32.372]  Oh, I'm just doing my job.
[00:55:32.372 --> 00:55:33.252]  What was the name of them?
[00:55:33.252 --> 00:55:35.333]  I can't quite put it.
[00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:37.254]  But there was some group out there and that was the excuse.
[00:55:37.254 --> 00:55:38.555]  I was just doing my job.
[00:55:38.555 --> 00:55:39.275]  How can I get that better?
[00:55:39.275 --> 00:55:40.615]  They were just doing their job.
[00:55:40.615 --> 00:55:42.296]  And then they figure out what you're talking about.
[00:55:42.296 --> 00:55:50.400]  Obviously the Nazis and these people are behaving like Nazis when you throw a 65 year old woman into a cop car because she doesn't want to wear a mask.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.741]  Oh, and she's supposedly the most at risk individual.
[00:55:55.504 --> 00:56:05.652]  Yeah, it's a rude awakening being in a position like that and having to realize in live time you're one of the last humans remaining on Earth.
[00:56:05.652 --> 00:56:07.733]  Everyone else is a mind slave.
[00:56:07.733 --> 00:56:11.276]  Everyone else is a walking zombie slave.
[00:56:11.276 --> 00:56:17.221]  And your desire to be free, your desire to live in reality, does not resonate with your fellow humans.
[00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:18.582]  They are gone.
[00:56:20.828 --> 00:56:24.209]  So, yeah, it's not a pleasant thing to try to be free in America anymore.
[00:56:24.209 --> 00:56:30.630]  Free thinkers are the most discriminated group of people in the United States of America today.
[00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:37.572]  Free thinkers are the most discriminated and hated group of people in the United States today.
[00:56:37.572 --> 00:56:41.293]  And it's videos like that that prove it.
[00:56:41.293 --> 00:56:44.994]  And this is going worldwide, and again, another example,
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.421]  Headline from the Daily Mail.
[00:56:47.421 --> 00:56:52.523]  Ranting customer brand sandwich shop staff Nazis after they ask him to wear a face mask.
[00:56:52.523 --> 00:56:54.705]  You're all Nazis, he screams.
[00:56:54.705 --> 00:56:58.707]  You're all traitors to your country, as they tell him to wear a face mask.
[00:56:58.707 --> 00:57:02.369]  This was in Lee's Sandwich Shop in Oklahoma City.
[00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:03.709]  And it's the same thing.
[00:57:03.709 --> 00:57:04.850]  Everybody in there staring.
[00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:07.832]  By the way, there's no mask mandate in Oklahoma.
[00:57:07.832 --> 00:57:09.993]  Unless you're a service worker, I think is the thing now.
[00:57:11.317 --> 00:57:12.238]  But, oh, see?
[00:57:12.238 --> 00:57:14.181]  He's in there saying, look at what they're doing!
[00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:15.382]  Nobody comes to his aid.
[00:57:15.382 --> 00:57:17.645]  Everyone bullies him, laughs at him.
[00:57:17.645 --> 00:57:21.350]  Again, you realize in that moment, you're one of the last humans alive.
[00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:24.113]  You are in zombie-osis land.
[00:57:24.113 --> 00:57:26.296]  You are in mind-slave-topia.
[00:57:27.893 --> 00:57:32.275]  You come out as a free thinker, you fight against this tyranny, you find that out real quick.
[00:57:32.275 --> 00:57:37.078]  Sidewalks way too crowded, Las Vegas Strip flooded with tourists as capacity limits ease.
[00:57:37.078 --> 00:57:41.620]  Yeah, the Austin streets were flooded with traffic, thousands of people out drinking, nobody wearing masks.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.861]  No spread!
[00:57:43.861 --> 00:57:44.402]  No spread.
[00:57:44.402 --> 00:57:46.643]  Myself, none of my friends, we're all feeling fine today.
[00:57:46.643 --> 00:57:49.924]  The whole thing's fake, but be a good slave dude anyway.
[00:57:49.924 --> 00:57:53.666]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[00:57:53.666 --> 00:57:56.828]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[00:57:57.358 --> 00:58:05.025]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[00:58:05.025 --> 00:58:10.791]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[00:58:10.791 --> 00:58:22.382]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[00:58:22.982 --> 00:58:25.124]  I need your help more than ever now.
[00:58:25.124 --> 00:58:29.246]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[00:58:29.246 --> 00:58:39.853]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:59:02.242 --> 00:59:05.246]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[00:59:05.246 --> 00:59:05.887]  It's got four
[00:59:06.147 --> 00:59:07.167]  We're good to go!
[00:59:27.532 --> 00:59:30.034]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[00:59:30.034 --> 00:59:32.016]  Talk about blasting off to sleep, it's incredible.
[00:59:32.016 --> 00:59:37.020]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest that's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[00:59:44.866 --> 00:59:53.153]  Down and out, InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:53.153 --> 00:59:55.835]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.912]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:00:09.912 --> 01:00:18.459]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:00:18.459 --> 01:00:25.784]  Alright, we have incredible amounts of left-wing terrorism, Democrat terrorism.
[01:00:26.952 --> 01:00:29.273]  ...happening across the United States right now.
[01:00:29.273 --> 01:00:31.194]  Of course it goes completely ignored by the media.
[01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:37.276]  They're still freaking out over the events of January 6th that didn't even stall the activities in Congress for more than five hours.
[01:00:37.276 --> 01:00:42.318]  They were back in Congress doing business, even after the supposed insurrection.
[01:00:42.318 --> 01:00:44.459]  The big lie, that big lie.
[01:00:44.459 --> 01:00:47.320]  No lie too big for the Democrat Party and their media cohorts.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.861]  They'll tell you any lie.
[01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:52.622]  So I would suggest not believing anything they say.
[01:00:52.622 --> 01:00:53.582]  You'll be much better off.
[01:00:53.582 --> 01:00:55.243]  But, again,
[01:00:56.721 --> 01:01:01.027]  They still obsess over the events of January 6th where four Trump supporters died.
[01:01:01.027 --> 01:01:02.990]  One lady was executed, a military veteran.
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:06.355]  You still don't get to know the name of the officer that killed her or shot her in the head.
[01:01:06.355 --> 01:01:08.518]  On tape, unarmed.
[01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:16.058]  And that's the worst thing that's ever happened, and we have the Capitol locked down.
[01:01:16.058 --> 01:01:29.345]  By the way, the National Guard has requested that we remove all the National Guard and the walls and everything, because it's on pace to cost us half a billion dollars a year right now, at current rates and pace.
[01:01:29.345 --> 01:01:32.968]  And Pelosi and Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, said, no way.
[01:01:32.968 --> 01:01:36.550]  If anything, we're going to have more National Guard here.
[01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:36.950]  For what?
[01:01:39.389 --> 01:01:45.312]  Well, to protect the criminals in Congress, don't you see?
[01:01:45.312 --> 01:01:50.054]  This is what it really comes down to.
[01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:58.517]  Nancy Pelosi and the like know that you know they are the biggest criminals in the history of America.
[01:01:58.517 --> 01:02:05.801]  The most treasonous, traitorous actors in our country's history are in Congress right now.
[01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:07.982]  And they know that you know that.
[01:02:07.982 --> 01:02:08.802]  And so they got
[01:02:09.887 --> 01:02:35.483]  So scared that three straight months over a million people who know that showed up in DC and even though we were peaceful it still scares them because they know at the flick of a switch that that could turn against them and we really could do we could really really could have taken Congress that day we they really could have taken the Capitol that was never the plan that was never the desire that's why most people walking in look confused and disoriented were walking around the ropes didn't know what they were doing
[01:02:36.952 --> 01:02:45.818]  But see, Pelosi and Schumer and Waters and Omar and the like know that you know they're the biggest criminals in the history of this country.
[01:02:45.818 --> 01:02:52.623]  They just robbed two trillion dollars, once again, printing two trillion dollars to enrich themselves and bail themselves out.
[01:02:52.623 --> 01:02:55.344]  So they need the wall at the Capitol.
[01:02:55.344 --> 01:03:00.888]  They need the National Guard at the Capitol because they need to protect themselves and their criminal behavior.
[01:03:00.888 --> 01:03:06.572]  It's mob psychology, but it's not mob, it's mafia psychology.
[01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.965]  You go to the big mafia Don's house, what does he have?
[01:03:09.965 --> 01:03:13.529]  He's got walls, he's got armed guards, he's behind it all.
[01:03:13.529 --> 01:03:19.935]  That's Congress now.
[01:03:19.935 --> 01:03:32.747]  But they don't seem to mind that Portland burns every night, they don't seem to mind that there's rioting in Los Angeles, they don't seem to mind that there's violence every night in Philadelphia, in New York, the list just goes on.
[01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:39.710]  So what do you use that to say?
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.530]  That the Democrats are total frauds and liars?
[01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:45.191]  Well, you already know that.
[01:03:45.191 --> 01:03:46.132]  But here's the problem.
[01:03:46.132 --> 01:03:49.113]  Most people don't even want to deal with this right now.
[01:03:49.113 --> 01:03:54.154]  And maybe that tide is starting to turn because it's getting so out of control.
[01:03:54.154 --> 01:04:00.616]  And I don't know how far ahead of the curve InfoWars is on this because we haven't reached that curve yet.
[01:04:02.563 --> 01:04:11.706]  But it's absolutely out of control what left-wing Democrat terrorism is going on and being completely ignored by the mainstream media.
[01:04:11.706 --> 01:04:16.587]  They tried to burn a federal courthouse in Portland on Friday with people inside.
[01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:20.128]  Media didn't even mention it.
[01:04:20.128 --> 01:04:27.050]  But the FBI is still going after you if you are in DC on January 6th.
[01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.691]  The FBI is still going after you
[01:04:30.777 --> 01:04:41.281]  But in Portland, you had a Montana man who traveled to Portland, got involved in the Portland riots, he was arrested, got released, and then got arrested again.
[01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:42.502]  Yeah.
[01:04:42.502 --> 01:04:45.623]  So I'm going to tell you all about it coming up.
[01:04:45.623 --> 01:04:54.726]  But the Democrat terror events continue to happen, and the Democrat big lies continue to permeate the hearts and minds of Americans.
[01:04:54.726 --> 01:04:56.427]  And it needs to stop or we're in big trouble.
[01:04:58.627 --> 01:05:02.652]  The general public has finally figured out why I'm upset.
[01:05:02.652 --> 01:05:05.656]  They figured out that the globalists are literally trying to kill us.
[01:05:05.656 --> 01:05:08.299]  They're trying to take over civilization and society.
[01:05:08.299 --> 01:05:11.283]  And they depend on the public being ignorant.
[01:05:11.283 --> 01:05:14.888]  That's why Jesus said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:17.191]  Knowledge is power, like our bodies.
[01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:24.073]  Are made up of all these tissues and all these systems that die without essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:05:24.073 --> 01:05:27.234]  And that's why they don't want you to know about essential vitamins and minerals.
[01:05:27.234 --> 01:05:28.354]  Because it's so simple.
[01:05:28.354 --> 01:05:30.335]  Because you won't be under their control anymore.
[01:05:30.335 --> 01:05:39.198]  Well, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the highest quality Vitamin Mineral Fusion system out there in a liquid vitamin form, is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:39.198 --> 01:05:41.538]  And it's not just an incredible formula at a great price.
[01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:44.679]  It funds the InfoWare at the same time.
[01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.540]  No other product you can buy does that.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.882]  So again, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:48.882 --> 01:05:50.945]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[01:05:50.945 --> 01:05:51.966]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:54.429]  I'm going to keep it at that until it sells out.
[01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:57.212]  So take action today and give it to your friends and family as a gift.
[01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:10.223]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:06:10.223 --> 01:06:12.464]  It's Owen Troyer.
[01:06:12.464 --> 01:06:15.626]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:16.587]  You know what?
[01:06:16.587 --> 01:06:23.591]  I need to get into this Democrat terrorism that's been happening as we enter the second hour, but I have not even plugged today.
[01:06:23.591 --> 01:06:25.232]  I am bad, and this is more important.
[01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:26.393]  We have to stay on air, folks.
[01:06:27.225 --> 01:06:34.791]  To fight back against the New World Order propaganda that's leading people to take a deadly vaccine, die from it, and then deny that that's what happened.
[01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:47.602]  That's led us to a point where you can have an American woman, 65 years old, get assaulted, harassed, and arrested by a cop for not wearing a mask inside a Bank of America in Texas where there is no mask mandate.
[01:06:47.602 --> 01:06:49.724]  For a fake pandemic that the media lied to them about.
[01:06:49.724 --> 01:06:53.307]  So, we're at the front lines fighting this propaganda with truth.
[01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:55.409]  It's the only sword and shield that we can wield here.
[01:06:56.249 --> 01:07:00.752]  And we need to stay on air to fight that, because you know there's very few and far between that are willing to stand up.
[01:07:00.752 --> 01:07:09.636]  Now, those few and far between that are willing to stand up are starting to take bigger leaps and strides, but it's still InfoWars leading the chart.
[01:07:09.636 --> 01:07:13.718]  So keep us on air by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:13.718 --> 01:07:16.500]  We have the final hours right now.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.941]  So Alex is back in town.
[01:07:17.941 --> 01:07:20.462]  He's going to have to cut new specials for tomorrow.
[01:07:20.462 --> 01:07:23.904]  So it's the final hours of free shipping store-wide.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.882]  And then the current sales we have, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off.
[01:07:28.882 --> 01:07:31.123]  Down and Out Liquid Sleep Support, 40% off.
[01:07:31.123 --> 01:07:40.167]  I will tell you, I tried Down and Out Liquid Sleep Support for the first time last night.
[01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:43.149]  You know what, I'm all confused because of the changing in time.
[01:07:43.149 --> 01:07:46.470]  It kind of had me confused and disoriented last night and this morning.
[01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:51.373]  But let me tell you, yeah, I was down and out for sure.
[01:07:51.373 --> 01:07:53.634]  For about eight hours, probably, I was down and out.
[01:07:54.386 --> 01:07:59.568]  And it was kind of shocking, waking up to the clock, I was like, holy smokes!
[01:07:59.568 --> 01:08:01.909]  Like, down and out is serious stuff!
[01:08:01.909 --> 01:08:04.350]  But then I realized that we lost an hour, too.
[01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:11.713]  So, point is, though, down and out, the trifecta, the new addition to the trifecta of sleep support we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.774]  I'm glad we have three different sleep support formulas.
[01:08:13.774 --> 01:08:15.855]  A lot of people struggle with sleep, including myself.
[01:08:16.784 --> 01:08:23.625]  And so it's good to have three different formulas to kind of go on and off each one so you don't get too tolerant to them and they remain effective.
[01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:25.666]  So down and out 40% off.
[01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:28.726]  That was got me down and out last night.
[01:08:28.726 --> 01:08:30.547]  Survival Shield X2 50% off.
[01:08:30.547 --> 01:08:33.547]  Turbo Force 40% off.
[01:08:33.547 --> 01:08:36.328]  Super Mill Vitality 40% off.
[01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:38.348]  We still have Privacy Pouches available.
[01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:40.489]  $10 off of those right now.
[01:08:40.489 --> 01:08:42.049]  And 50% off Vitamin B12, Ultra 12.
[01:08:42.049 --> 01:08:42.869]  50% off Alexa Pure Pro
[01:08:47.572 --> 01:08:49.634]  Uh, air filter and I believe the water filters, too.
[01:08:49.634 --> 01:08:52.276]  So, these specials, though, have hours left.
[01:08:52.276 --> 01:08:56.019]  Alex is going to have to come cut new specials tomorrow, now that he's back in town.
[01:08:56.019 --> 01:09:01.003]  So, final hours of free shipping, store-wide.
[01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:05.346]  Now, guys, we've got all kinds of videos.
[01:09:05.346 --> 01:09:09.990]  So, if you guys just want to be rolling this B-roll, whether it's from L.A.
[01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:13.133]  or New York or Portland or wherever it's all from, as I cover these headlines,
[01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:25.267]  But remember as a backdrop, Ashley Babbitt got executed on film in Washington, D.C.
[01:09:25.267 --> 01:09:26.688]  by a Capitol Police officer.
[01:09:26.688 --> 01:09:29.909]  We still don't know that individual's name.
[01:09:29.909 --> 01:09:31.370]  How is that possible?
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:35.071]  And the big lie, oh, police violence is racism.
[01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:38.772]  If that was a white person, they wouldn't have been shot.
[01:09:38.772 --> 01:09:40.733]  What about Ashley Babbitt?
[01:09:40.733 --> 01:09:43.834]  And we don't even get to know the cop's name.
[01:09:43.834 --> 01:09:45.275]  So that's interesting.
[01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:52.414]  But just remember that as a backdrop and remember that the Democrats have put D.C.
[01:09:52.414 --> 01:09:57.738]  under martial law lockdown without even a vote to protect their own criminal behavior.
[01:09:57.738 --> 01:09:59.900]  They just stole two trillion dollars.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:09.448]  So Congress just stole two trillion dollars and they did it while they were protected by our military.
[01:10:09.448 --> 01:10:11.830]  Oh man, but here we go.
[01:10:13.985 --> 01:10:19.449]  So, will there be incitement charges for Joe Biden or Linda Sarsour?
[01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:33.738]  Linda Sarsour was leading rallies over the weekend, speaking during rallies during the one-year anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death, saying, we're going to have rallies, we're going to be louder than ever, we're going to be in cities across America.
[01:10:33.738 --> 01:10:36.220]  And then that night, what happened?
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:42.004]  Violence, destruction, criminal behavior, arson.
[01:10:43.135 --> 01:10:44.115]  Assault.
[01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.256]  Battery.
[01:10:46.256 --> 01:10:51.618]  Biden urges police reform as Breonna Taylor protests turn violent across the nation.
[01:10:51.618 --> 01:10:53.439]  So that's Biden's response.
[01:10:53.439 --> 01:11:01.661]  Hey, a bunch of people just went out and burned cities to the ground, assaulted police officers, attacked federal court buildings, guilty of arson, all kinds of criminal behavior.
[01:11:01.661 --> 01:11:04.662]  They get arrested and released and then arrested again.
[01:11:04.662 --> 01:11:05.703]  And what's Biden's response?
[01:11:05.703 --> 01:11:07.023]  We need police reform.
[01:11:07.023 --> 01:11:09.124]  Well, look.
[01:11:10.552 --> 01:11:17.358]  I'm telling you right now, the quickest solution to this problem is to actually get rid of the police.
[01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:22.762]  It's not what I want necessarily to happen because it'll be a total breakdown of civilization.
[01:11:22.762 --> 01:11:30.529]  But at this point, civilization is already broke and the police are only police because they need a paycheck.
[01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:32.370]  That's where we're at now.
[01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.392]  And so they really can't even do their job.
[01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:36.754]  It's all just political theater and ceremony.
[01:11:38.064 --> 01:11:40.025]  And so look, I feel bad for the police.
[01:11:40.025 --> 01:11:43.167]  I think for the most part, they're good people.
[01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:45.209]  They're in a bad situation and everybody's got it.
[01:11:45.209 --> 01:11:46.550]  Everybody needs a paycheck, folks.
[01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:49.492]  Everybody's got a mortgage, rent, bills, kids, whatever.
[01:11:49.492 --> 01:12:04.081]  So they can't quit, even though I'm sure it's not a very positive experience for police right now, especially in Portland or Los Angeles or New York or Chicago, where the Democrat Party has basically put a target on your back to be murdered.
[01:12:04.081 --> 01:12:05.182]  But so you get attacked every night.
[01:12:05.182 --> 01:12:06.783]  The media doesn't even care.
[01:12:06.783 --> 01:12:07.764]  The FBI doesn't even care.
[01:12:08.968 --> 01:12:11.850]  And the politicians don't even care.
[01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.411]  So I'm serious.
[01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:17.993]  Either police should just fully stand down at this point.
[01:12:17.993 --> 01:12:19.594]  That's if you just want to keep your jobs.
[01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:20.695]  I would just stand down.
[01:12:20.695 --> 01:12:21.695]  Let them just burn it all.
[01:12:21.695 --> 01:12:23.336]  Hey, again, I'm not promoting this.
[01:12:23.336 --> 01:12:24.877]  I'm not the one that wants the violence.
[01:12:24.877 --> 01:12:26.218]  I'm just saying we got a problem here.
[01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:33.102]  And the only way people are going to realize that we have a problem here is if the police actually disappear for a month or so.
[01:12:34.329 --> 01:12:38.518]  And entire city blocks are burned to the ground.
[01:12:38.518 --> 01:12:44.732]  Entire city blocks are looted for every last scrap that these criminal thugs can find.
[01:12:48.519 --> 01:12:49.039]  Guess what?
[01:12:49.039 --> 01:12:51.301]  America will wake up real fast.
[01:12:51.301 --> 01:13:00.068]  And then when they end up at Nancy Pelosi's front door, and they end up at Maxine Waters' front door, and Chuck Schumer's front door, and the rest of the Democrats' front door, guess what?
[01:13:00.068 --> 01:13:02.650]  They're going to be begging for police then.
[01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:10.917]  But see, they'll have their own private security, which would expose them even further.
[01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:14.880]  But the FBI doesn't investigate, and they get arrested and released, folks.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.021]  They get arrested and released.
[01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:27.088]  There are dozens, if not hundreds, we don't know the number, dozens if not hundreds of Trump supporters, Americans, many of which are veterans, rotting in jail right now.
[01:13:27.088 --> 01:13:34.554]  Families, mothers, fathers, veterans, pastors, rotting in jail right now because they were in Washington D.C.
[01:13:34.554 --> 01:13:35.675]  on January 6th.
[01:13:35.675 --> 01:13:38.437]  Nobody's even reporting this except Infowars.
[01:13:38.437 --> 01:13:39.538]  Because they get arrested,
[01:13:40.797 --> 01:13:43.378]  A Democrat judge says, no, you're a threat to society.
[01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:45.538]  I have to keep you in jail until your court date.
[01:13:45.538 --> 01:13:50.299]  And then they delay the court date months and months and months and months and months because of the fake pandemic.
[01:13:50.299 --> 01:13:51.279]  They can't go to court.
[01:13:51.279 --> 01:13:52.559]  And they say, you can't be released.
[01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:53.900]  You're a threat to society.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.400]  Children.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:04.442]  Mothers, fathers, pastors rotting in jail cells right now because of the FBI and our politicians.
[01:14:04.442 --> 01:14:09.263]  Many of which their only crime was being on Capitol grounds.
[01:14:09.263 --> 01:14:09.803]  That's it.
[01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:14.026]  That's a crime now.
[01:14:14.026 --> 01:14:16.886]  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the Cusamon case.
[01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:19.307]  By the way, he's still rotting in a jail cell.
[01:14:19.307 --> 01:14:28.168]  His defense is arguing, how can you hold my client for entering a building illegally when he was waved in by the police?
[01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:31.869]  So that's in front of a judge right now with all the footage.
[01:14:31.869 --> 01:14:33.429]  But guess what?
[01:14:33.429 --> 01:14:37.070]  If you got a Democrat judge, you're going to jail no matter what.
[01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.730]  And here's the difference.
[01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:44.811]  You want to know why Peter Doocy is the only person in the White House Press Corps that asks any real questions of Jen Psaki?
[01:14:44.811 --> 01:14:49.754]  Because everyone else is a Democrat.
[01:14:49.754 --> 01:15:01.021]  You have Democrats who are activists as judges and PAs and DAs and mayors and politicians, but they don't actually do their job.
[01:15:01.021 --> 01:15:06.264]  They put their agenda and their activism over their job.
[01:15:06.264 --> 01:15:08.065]  So that's why they're able to get away with this.
[01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:20.256]  And that's why Trump supporters are rotting in jails, while individuals like a Montana man are arrested twice during the same riot in Portland over the weekend.
[01:15:20.256 --> 01:15:23.038]  Because Democrats are activists.
[01:15:23.038 --> 01:15:24.819]  They're not real.
[01:15:24.819 --> 01:15:36.086]  A Democrat on a journey, a jury, or a bench, or in politics, will always put their agenda before reality, before the truth, before the evidence, before any of it.
[01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:40.092]  That's why these people are so dangerous, folks.
[01:15:40.092 --> 01:15:43.214]  That's why once you give them control, they never relinquish it.
[01:15:43.214 --> 01:15:45.094]  That's why they want you to wear the mask.
[01:15:45.094 --> 01:15:46.975]  That's why they want you to take a vaccine.
[01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:48.616]  That's why they want to take your guns.
[01:15:48.616 --> 01:15:50.457]  That's why they want to censor you on the internet.
[01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:57.454]  Because they hate you and they'll do anything they can to destroy you.
[01:15:57.454 --> 01:16:01.396]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:16:01.396 --> 01:16:04.017]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[01:16:04.017 --> 01:16:04.777]  Why do you do that?
[01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:07.719]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:16:07.719 --> 01:16:09.740]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey,
[01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:19.333]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:19.573]  Boom!
[01:16:19.573 --> 01:16:19.974]  We did it.
[01:16:19.974 --> 01:16:20.474]  It's popular.
[01:16:20.474 --> 01:16:21.234]  It's X3.
[01:16:21.234 --> 01:16:22.475]  Is it better than X2?
[01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:23.135]  You decide.
[01:16:23.135 --> 01:16:24.616]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:16:24.616 --> 01:16:28.758]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[01:16:29.638 --> 01:16:31.800]  SleepAid, and that is down and out.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.505]  It's super strong, way stronger than knockout, but they don't compete with each other.

[01:16:57.481 --> 01:17:03.156]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[01:17:03.156 --> 01:17:05.843]  But world government is only the control grid.
[01:17:06.397 --> 01:17:13.944]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[01:17:13.944 --> 01:17:20.970]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based life forms.
[01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.212]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[01:17:23.212 --> 01:17:26.955]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[01:17:26.955 --> 01:17:28.156]  They are playing God.
[01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:38.682]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[01:17:38.682 --> 01:17:44.005]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the Globalist, it's all on record.
[01:17:44.005 --> 01:17:46.447]  You have been warned.
[01:17:46.447 --> 01:17:50.889]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[01:17:50.889 --> 01:17:54.471]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.933]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[01:17:59.033 --> 01:18:07.229]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:18:08.522 --> 01:18:13.265]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:18:13.265 --> 01:18:15.607]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:24.453]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:18:24.453 --> 01:18:32.439]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals.
[01:18:32.859 --> 01:18:35.621]  And no unwanted additives.
[01:18:35.621 --> 01:18:36.301]  Yes.
[01:18:36.301 --> 01:18:41.204]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:18:41.204 --> 01:18:47.849]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:49.189]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:27.756]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:19:27.756 --> 01:19:32.000]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.645]  But the new website is theresistance.video.
[01:19:36.645 --> 01:19:38.607]  Theresistance.video.
[01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.129]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful.
[01:19:41.169 --> 01:19:43.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:18.773]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:20:18.773 --> 01:20:21.335]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:20:21.335 --> 01:20:24.817]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.817 --> 01:20:27.600]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:40.284]  Yes, Democrat terrorism continues to run rampant across the United States and the media continues to ignore it because, of course, they're not actual members of the media or journalists or reporters.
[01:20:40.284 --> 01:20:41.965]  They're, well, Democrats.
[01:20:41.965 --> 01:20:46.786]  And so why would they call out their own criminal activity that they love to promote and engage in?
[01:20:46.786 --> 01:20:51.388]  Democrats promote the violence, then they hide the violence, and then they say, oh, you're being violent.
[01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.849]  It's a cyclical thing with these people.
[01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.890]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.990]  And in Chicago, now,
[01:21:00.666 --> 01:21:20.162]  You may remember, over the summer, some of the violence that happened in Chicago, where you had all the police, dozens if not hundreds of police, surrounding the Christopher Columbus statue, and they were surrounded by a Black Lives Matter Democrat mob, violent mob, insurrectious mob, insurrection mob.
[01:21:20.162 --> 01:21:27.588]  And so, you had hundreds of Chicago police injured, you saw all these criminals throwing projectiles, bricks,
[01:21:29.045 --> 01:21:45.494]  The PP bottles and all the other stuff that the left-wing terrorists are known to engage with, literally like bottles of PP and poo-poo, that's what they do, they PP and poo-poo over there, the Democrat Party terrorists.
[01:21:45.494 --> 01:21:55.699]  And so, that statue though, that was protected by the Chicago police when they were so viciously assaulted that day, well it's now been removed!
[01:21:57.538 --> 01:22:02.062]  See, mob violence and Democrat terrorism accomplishes things.
[01:22:02.062 --> 01:22:03.924]  That's why they continue to do it.
[01:22:03.924 --> 01:22:10.070]  The media ignores it, and then we capitulate, and the cycle repeats itself until we stop the cycle.
[01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:12.792]  You understand?
[01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:19.799]  And the irony, of course, is they are still investigating the violence from that day.
[01:22:19.799 --> 01:22:22.141]  Chicago police seeking to identify people involved in a
[01:22:22.978 --> 01:22:26.880]  Last, in last summer's clash with officers at Columbus Statue in Grant Park.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:31.082]  So, hundreds of officers injured, taken to the hospital.
[01:22:31.082 --> 01:22:36.926]  But, even though they're still searching for those criminals, they gave them what they wanted.
[01:22:36.926 --> 01:22:41.148]  The Democrat terror mob, terrorist mob, wins again.
[01:22:41.812 --> 01:22:44.093]  Promoted and covered up by the mainstream media.
[01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:46.273]  Funded by the Democrat Party.
[01:22:46.273 --> 01:22:47.734]  Promoted by the Democrat Party.
[01:22:47.734 --> 01:22:54.655]  So, oh, but they took the statue down even though they're still investigating the Democrat terrorists who were out there that day assaulting police officers.
[01:22:54.655 --> 01:22:55.176]  So that's good.
[01:22:55.176 --> 01:22:57.836]  Give the terrorist mob what it wants.
[01:22:57.836 --> 01:23:02.998]  I'm sure there will be no negative repercussions of that.
[01:23:02.998 --> 01:23:08.159]  And also you have Democrat terrorists attacking individuals in the street.
[01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:19.562]  Man that has a sign that says children cannot consent to puberty blockers suffers broken arm after Antifa gang assault.
[01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:31.705]  So once again you have more, here's the video, you have more Democrat terrorism on the streets and these people won't even be arrested.
[01:23:31.705 --> 01:23:32.345]  They never are.
[01:23:32.345 --> 01:23:37.386]  And if they are, they get released, bailed out on Democrat money.
[01:23:39.742 --> 01:23:44.126]  By Democrat DAs, District Attorneys, Prosecuting Attorneys.
[01:23:44.126 --> 01:23:44.986]  Always bail them out.
[01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:47.388]  But if you're a Trump supporter, you're gonna rot in jail forever.
[01:23:47.388 --> 01:23:49.630]  You're gonna get the worst side of the law.
[01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:53.753]  These people are behaving like true Nazis, except they're worse.
[01:23:53.753 --> 01:24:05.383]  And also, not only do you have the left-wing Democrat political violence that we see every day, the Democrat racist hate crimes continue to happen in New York, in California,
[01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:22.328]  And so you have, and in Philadelphia, guys roll clip, b-roll from 13, and apparently this is just commonplace in Philadelphia, when I was researching this story, there's just this basically a dirt bike gang in Philadelphia that just runs roughshod over the city.
[01:24:22.328 --> 01:24:27.610]  Now this individual is on his dirt bike, pulls out his gun, and finally his other friends
[01:24:29.443 --> 01:24:35.588]  So he's attacking people in their vehicles, smashing bricks into vehicles, pulls out his gun, nearly kills an Asian man.
[01:24:35.588 --> 01:24:39.811]  So the hate crimes against Asians and white people by black people continue.
[01:24:39.811 --> 01:24:40.672]  You're not allowed to say that.
[01:24:40.672 --> 01:24:42.534]  You're not allowed to report on that.
[01:24:42.534 --> 01:24:45.196]  You're not allowed to show the crime statistics.
[01:24:45.196 --> 01:24:52.081]  You're not allowed to show the hit game videos where they attack Asians and white people in the streets and kill them sometimes.
[01:24:52.081 --> 01:24:53.122]  You're not allowed to talk about that.
[01:24:53.122 --> 01:24:54.543]  You're not allowed to show that.
[01:24:54.543 --> 01:24:55.944]  It's racist to show that.
[01:24:55.944 --> 01:24:58.967]  It's racist to show the racists attacking innocent people.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:08.665]  So this is just what the Democrat Party is up to, promoting their terrorism, promoting their mob violence.
[01:25:08.665 --> 01:25:11.487]  It is, after all, the biggest hate group in the United States.
[01:25:11.487 --> 01:25:12.608]  That is the Democrat Party.
[01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:14.989]  It is, of course, the biggest terror group in the United States.
[01:25:14.989 --> 01:25:17.211]  That is, of course, the Democrat Party.
[01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:27.238]  But they can engage in all their criminal, mob, mafia violence as they steal two trillion dollars from you behind the National Guard.
[01:25:27.238 --> 01:25:30.761]  But you can't have Fourth of July.
[01:25:31.556 --> 01:25:36.721]  Biden said, you're not allowed to have 4th of July unless you get your vaccine, then maybe we'll let you be free.
[01:25:36.721 --> 01:25:44.068]  Because, you know, he's the tyrant-in-chief now, who wakes up every day and doesn't know where he is, his own admission.
[01:25:44.068 --> 01:25:53.176]  But now the National Park Service under Biden is rejecting a request from South Dakota to have fireworks at Mount Rushmore this year.
[01:25:53.877 --> 01:25:58.579]  So, the Democrats are allowed to engage in straight-up terrorism in the streets.
[01:25:58.579 --> 01:26:07.823]  The Democrats are allowed to engage in straight-up promotion and bailing out of this terrorism, not to mention the hate crimes and racism that they're engaged with on a daily basis.
[01:26:07.823 --> 01:26:17.067]  They're allowed to do this all day long, but you can't even have fireworks at Mount Rushmore on the 4th of July.
[01:26:17.067 --> 01:26:19.048]  See what happens when Democrats get in charge, folks?
[01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:22.870]  These people destroy everything.
[01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:23.230]  Everything.
[01:26:24.767 --> 01:26:25.727]  This is a cancer.
[01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:27.247]  This is a cancer of civilization.
[01:26:27.247 --> 01:26:29.688]  This is a cancer of culture.
[01:26:29.688 --> 01:26:34.589]  Yeah, you have cancer culture run by the Democrats, but it's really a cancer culture.
[01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:40.190]  It will kill our culture and civilization, and it's metastasizing now.
[01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:44.410]  And so, you know what has to happen.
[01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:51.412]  On the 4th of July, patriots need to go to Mount Rushmore and just have your own firework display.
[01:26:51.412 --> 01:26:54.132]  Shove it in these globalists' rear end.
[01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:57.571]  Shove it in these Democrats' rear end.
[01:26:57.571 --> 01:27:00.113]  We're free people!
[01:27:00.113 --> 01:27:01.934]  You don't tell us to stay home.
[01:27:01.934 --> 01:27:04.395]  You don't tell us we can't have barbecues.
[01:27:04.395 --> 01:27:08.197]  You don't tell us we can't hug our grandmas.
[01:27:08.197 --> 01:27:09.338]  You are the criminals.
[01:27:09.338 --> 01:27:11.279]  You are the tyrants.
[01:27:11.279 --> 01:27:17.362]  So, let's see what happens at Mount Rushmore this 4th of July as they are refusing to let people
[01:27:18.303 --> 01:27:20.224]  Have the firework display there.
[01:27:20.224 --> 01:27:24.845]  Kristi Noem is not going to rest easy on this one, I predict, the Governor of South Dakota.
[01:27:24.845 --> 01:27:30.167]  And I don't know if the American people will, or the citizens of South Dakota will either.
[01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:33.488]  But, you know, I'll finish with this.
[01:27:33.488 --> 01:27:38.269]  Liberalism, Democrat Party politics, are a cancer to culture and civilization.
[01:27:38.269 --> 01:27:41.350]  And it's the strangest thing because they've ruined sports.
[01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:48.900]  You know, one of my escapes, even after I left the sports media, was still just maybe on a Saturday, I'd like to watch a sports game.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:57.342]  I can go to the suspended reality and be a kid again, and it's fun to cheer and watch sports, and the glamour and the majesty and all of it.
[01:27:57.342 --> 01:27:58.902]  It's dead.
[01:27:58.902 --> 01:28:00.863]  Liberals have killed sports, folks.
[01:28:00.863 --> 01:28:03.824]  And it's not just liberals, but it's other elements.
[01:28:03.824 --> 01:28:06.365]  But sports are not even enjoyable anymore.
[01:28:06.365 --> 01:28:09.745]  All the propaganda, it's all about the individual now.
[01:28:09.745 --> 01:28:11.506]  They're all rich, spoiled brats.
[01:28:12.555 --> 01:28:26.221]  And you can tell, when you're watching the old footage of Marvin Hagler, and I was just watching old games that I went to as a kid, it's just so much more enjoyable than the new sports that are just shoving all the propaganda down your throat.
[01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:29.042]  Everything is a money suck.
[01:28:29.042 --> 01:28:30.243]  It's not even about the game.
[01:28:31.462 --> 01:28:38.846]  It's very disrespectful of the game, actually, but don't worry, they're making every piece of space on that TV is a bought advertisement.
[01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:42.408]  Every player is larger than life with their money in their social media.
[01:28:42.408 --> 01:28:46.670]  And don't worry, the left-wing propaganda is everywhere as well, infiltrating it.
[01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:53.454]  So you have to go watch sports from like the 90s and before, or the early 2000s, even enjoy it anymore, because why?
[01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:55.975]  Liberalism is a cancer to culture, and it kills it.
[01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:01.671]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:06.233]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[01:29:06.233 --> 01:29:15.456]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[01:29:15.456 --> 01:29:19.557]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[01:29:20.077 --> 01:29:37.422]  They are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[01:29:38.022 --> 01:29:53.859]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[01:29:53.859 --> 01:29:57.283]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[01:29:58.437 --> 01:30:06.528]  As you know, we're always upping our game at InfoWars, and we brought you a new supplement, a new product that we know you're gonna love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[01:30:06.528 --> 01:30:07.589]  It is Down and Out.

[01:30:12.396 --> 01:30:13.057]  It's got four
[01:30:13.237 --> 01:30:13.818]  I think so.
[01:30:34.697 --> 01:30:37.200]  If you take it subliminally under the tongue, oh!
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.481]  Talk about blasting off of sleep.
[01:30:38.481 --> 01:30:39.182]  It's incredible.
[01:30:39.182 --> 01:30:41.704]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:44.187]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[01:31:54.270 --> 01:32:00.676]  InfoWarsStore.com This is Greg Reese from InfoWars.com
[01:32:01.554 --> 01:32:05.577]  I have many reasons to be grateful for working at InfoWars.
[01:32:05.577 --> 01:32:12.441]  One of them is that we support ourselves with great products that promote physical health and vitality.
[01:32:12.441 --> 01:32:20.265]  I've been using health supplements for years, and I have found our products at InfoWarsStore.com to be the best.
[01:32:20.265 --> 01:32:23.567]  Especially our Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:32:23.567 --> 01:32:29.391]  Before trying Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually did anything.
[01:32:30.083 --> 01:32:33.686]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[01:32:33.686 --> 01:32:37.169]  But I felt Vitamin Mineral Fusion the first time I took it.
[01:32:37.169 --> 01:32:38.711]  Immediately.
[01:32:38.711 --> 01:32:40.752]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[01:32:40.752 --> 01:32:42.594]  I take it every day with my supper.
[01:32:42.594 --> 01:32:43.915]  It tastes great.
[01:32:43.915 --> 01:32:45.176]  Feels great.

[01:33:46.428 --> 01:33:54.735]  I think Patrick Halley is going to be dropping some exclusive intelligence coming up on InfoWars Sunday Night Live regarding the Vegas shooting.
[01:33:54.735 --> 01:34:03.782]  And of course, it's pretty much the same intel that we had when it happened, but he's going to lay out some more of the details as he's being threatened and intimidated right now.
[01:34:03.782 --> 01:34:06.685]  So, you're going to want to watch Harrison Smith and Patrick Halley coming up.

[01:34:48.419 --> 01:34:54.040]  Down and Out, the liquid tincture version, really, of Rocket Rest.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:58.881]  I tried it for the first time last night, and it is very effective.
[01:34:58.881 --> 01:35:01.121]  Perhaps the most effective, and I'm not sure.
[01:35:01.121 --> 01:35:05.582]  Between that and Rocket Rest, very similar results for me.
[01:35:05.582 --> 01:35:12.883]  And I was just kind of just confused and disoriented when I woke up, and it was like so late, but then I realized we lost an hour while I was sleeping.
[01:35:12.883 --> 01:35:16.324]  But Down and Out, brand new to Infowarsstore.com,

[01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:36.555]  Okay, let me continue on with the rest of these news stories.
[01:35:36.555 --> 01:35:42.199]  Once again, the Democrat Party and their media cohorts, all they do is lie.
[01:35:42.199 --> 01:35:44.361]  That's just the reality of the situation.
[01:35:44.361 --> 01:35:45.602]  And so here's one example.
[01:35:46.283 --> 01:35:52.868]  Pelosi says climate change is responsible for crisis on the southern border.
[01:35:52.868 --> 01:36:00.654]  So they don't know what to do to cover up this total catastrophe happening at the southern border because of Joe Biden's policies, which aren't really his policies.
[01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:03.636]  Who knows whose policies they actually are?
[01:36:03.636 --> 01:36:06.318]  Biden doesn't know his policies.
[01:36:06.318 --> 01:36:09.640]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.643]  But Pelosi says it's climate change.
[01:36:12.643 --> 01:36:12.823]  Wow.
[01:36:13.846 --> 01:36:14.708]  Now what is it really?
[01:36:14.708 --> 01:36:24.268]  It's really the fact that you've opened the border and that you're promising free handouts and that they're coming from hellhole countries destroyed by communism.
[01:36:25.672 --> 01:36:28.173]  But don't let the truth get in the way of the big lie.
[01:36:28.173 --> 01:36:29.933]  No, it's climate change, says Pelosi.
[01:36:29.933 --> 01:36:37.035]  So, they're trying to find a way to justify the fact that they have now hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border.
[01:36:37.035 --> 01:36:40.175]  They're testing positive for COVID and they're releasing them into your cities.
[01:36:40.175 --> 01:36:41.476]  They're putting them on planes.
[01:36:41.476 --> 01:36:42.916]  They're putting them on helicopters.
[01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.496]  They're putting them on buses.
[01:36:44.496 --> 01:36:47.677]  And they're releasing them into your major cities.
[01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:50.478]  Hundreds of thousands a month.
[01:36:50.478 --> 01:36:52.198]  I'll predict right now that
[01:36:53.215 --> 01:36:58.918]  May, the month of May, you'll have 300,000 illegal border crossings.
[01:36:58.918 --> 01:37:00.579]  It'll be a new record.
[01:37:00.579 --> 01:37:03.201]  And it's called an invasion, folks.
[01:37:03.201 --> 01:37:07.423]  A functioning society, a functioning country, calls this an invasion.
[01:37:07.423 --> 01:37:08.284]  And it is an invasion!
[01:37:08.863 --> 01:37:13.765]  I'm not saying the people invading us are bad, but you do have the drug cartels running their drugs and their deadly fentanyl.
[01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:17.727]  Which, by the way, you have record amounts of fentanyl being taken off the streets right now.
[01:37:17.727 --> 01:37:19.428]  Yeah, it's because the borders are open again.
[01:37:19.428 --> 01:37:25.911]  Oh, and it's Biden's... One of Biden's appointees invests in one of the companies that makes the heroin!
[01:37:25.911 --> 01:37:26.751]  Ho-ho!
[01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:28.512]  You can't even make this stuff up!
[01:37:28.512 --> 01:37:28.952]  Gupta!
[01:37:30.126 --> 01:37:31.247]  That's her name.
[01:37:31.247 --> 01:37:31.868]  Gupta!
[01:37:31.868 --> 01:37:36.574]  Yeah, she's invested millions of dollars in a company that makes heroin that gets smothered over the southern border.
[01:37:36.574 --> 01:37:39.778]  But don't let that get in the way of a good Biden appointee.
[01:37:39.778 --> 01:37:41.240]  If it's even his appointee.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.182]  It's total criminal behavior.
[01:37:43.182 --> 01:37:45.445]  And so the Democrats need any excuse they can.
[01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:51.288]  For the overflow of the kids in cages, they had to re-open the cages, actually.
[01:37:51.288 --> 01:38:00.530]  They're reception centers now, but literally the places that they called cages, where they sent for their photoshoots with AOC and the rest, those were closed by Trump.
[01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:05.772]  The Democrats, Biden had to re-open them for all the overflow.
[01:38:05.772 --> 01:38:09.493]  So they needed somehow to cover this disaster at the southern border up.
[01:38:09.493 --> 01:38:10.693]  There were parts of the wall
[01:38:11.522 --> 01:38:20.426]  They needed one or two days, one or two days, two days max to complete part of these sections of the wall where there's like 20, 30 foot gaps.
[01:38:20.426 --> 01:38:22.287]  Biden shut it down.
[01:38:22.287 --> 01:38:25.108]  He literally called and said, stop this construction.
[01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:30.210]  And now there's these huge gaps in the wall and they're just pouring in.
[01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:39.334]  You can look at all these different journalists, Julio Rosas, Ben Burkwam, I forget the other lady at Fox, Laura Logan.
[01:38:40.051 --> 01:38:49.314]  Folks, they go down to the southern border to do a report and they can't even get their camera set up in time to capture the thousands of people pouring in illegally.
[01:38:49.314 --> 01:38:55.516]  So they have to, they pull out their phones and they film it on their phone because they can't even get a camera set up.
[01:38:55.516 --> 01:39:00.338]  Because it's, they get down there and immediately they're pouring across.
[01:39:00.338 --> 01:39:04.319]  And that's why you see all the footage of it shot on cell phones.
[01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:08.981]  Because they don't even have enough time to get a camera set up on a tripod.
[01:39:10.143 --> 01:39:16.327]  So it's like, oh, here comes the southern border, the crossing's happening illegally, get out the cell phone, the camera's not ready.
[01:39:16.327 --> 01:39:17.347]  And what does Pelosi say?
[01:39:17.347 --> 01:39:18.808]  Oh, it's climate change.
[01:39:18.808 --> 01:39:28.934]  Now the funny thing is, you have more expats moving to Central America right now, perhaps ever, than has ever been in this country's history.
[01:39:28.934 --> 01:39:32.896]  They're moving to Belize, they are moving to Mexico.
[01:39:32.896 --> 01:39:34.297]  They are moving to Nicaragua.
[01:39:35.993 --> 01:39:44.440]  There's whole communities of expats buying up land and turning it into neighborhoods in the Gulf, on rivers.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.864]  I know multiple people that have done this.
[01:39:48.864 --> 01:39:50.545]  So, they go to Costa Rica.
[01:39:50.545 --> 01:39:51.026]  I mean, I'm serious.
[01:39:51.026 --> 01:39:53.027]  The amount of expats moving to Central America.
[01:39:53.027 --> 01:39:54.889]  So, what does that tell you?
[01:39:54.889 --> 01:40:02.135]  So, the globalists or communist party politics have destroyed Central America.
[01:40:02.802 --> 01:40:09.984]  So all the people, the number is now at, in the last 10 or 20 years, the United States of America has taken 15%.
[01:40:09.984 --> 01:40:14.326]  This number could be up to 20 before long.
[01:40:14.326 --> 01:40:16.506]  I don't even know what you would search, guys.
[01:40:16.506 --> 01:40:24.849]  But we've taken now 15% in the last couple of decades of Central America's entire population.
[01:40:24.849 --> 01:40:27.249]  15%!
[01:40:27.249 --> 01:40:28.870]  They broke those civilizations.
[01:40:30.126 --> 01:40:33.629]  The same policies the Democrats want here broke Central America.
[01:40:33.629 --> 01:40:35.010]  So yeah, these people are downtrodden.
[01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:35.931]  They try to come to America.
[01:40:35.931 --> 01:40:36.952]  They think it's going to be better.
[01:40:36.952 --> 01:40:42.956]  Meanwhile, successful smart people in America are rushing to Nicaragua.
[01:40:42.956 --> 01:40:43.277]  What?
[01:40:43.277 --> 01:40:44.798]  Rushing to Honduras.
[01:40:44.798 --> 01:40:46.639]  Rushing to Belize.
[01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:57.428]  Because they can buy cheap property on a river or a beach and farm and grow their own food and not have to deal with the collapsing United States of America and the tyranny here.
[01:41:01.953 --> 01:41:04.936]  What a dichotomy that is.
[01:41:04.936 --> 01:41:07.999]  But Pelosi says it's because of climate change.
[01:41:07.999 --> 01:41:11.202]  Once again, telling the big lie.
[01:41:11.202 --> 01:41:17.147]  Daryl Issa understands the Democrat hypocrisy.
[01:41:17.147 --> 01:41:17.488]  He says,
[01:41:18.559 --> 01:41:22.262]  Democrats are taking credit for the vaccine and blaming Trump for the border crisis.
[01:41:22.262 --> 01:41:23.643]  Of course, what's the reality?
[01:41:23.643 --> 01:41:31.108]  Trump was actually getting the border crisis under control, and if it wasn't for Trump, you wouldn't be having these vaccines right now.
[01:41:31.108 --> 01:41:35.952]  Now, I don't know if that's totally true, because the vaccine agenda was obviously always there.
[01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:41.824]  But for whatever reason, Trump really wants the credit for the vaccines.
[01:41:41.824 --> 01:41:43.105]  And I know why.
[01:41:43.105 --> 01:41:52.450]  It's because he sees all of his friends and all the liberals begging for the vaccine, saying it's the greatest thing ever, saying thank God for the vaccine, like getting on their knees crying because they can get a vaccine.
[01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:54.711]  So Trump's just like, hey, I'm the one that did that.
[01:41:54.711 --> 01:41:55.131]  Remember that?
[01:41:55.131 --> 01:41:57.712]  You hate me so much, but I'm the one that got you the vaccine.
[01:41:57.712 --> 01:41:59.273]  So I understand why he does it.
[01:41:59.273 --> 01:42:00.594]  It's kind of more of an ego thing.
[01:42:02.036 --> 01:42:05.558]  But the reality is he launched Operation Warp Speed.
[01:42:05.558 --> 01:42:08.960]  That's why the vaccines got rushed to delivery.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.441]  But Biden says, oh, that was me.
[01:42:10.441 --> 01:42:16.244]  Biden says there was no plan at all for a vaccine when he got into the White House, even though he'd already been vaccinated.
[01:42:16.244 --> 01:42:19.785]  That's how big of a liar he is, or he doesn't even know where he is.
[01:42:19.785 --> 01:42:23.868]  And then there's the border crisis was actually starting to move in the right direction under Trump.
[01:42:23.868 --> 01:42:25.288]  We are getting the border under control.
[01:42:25.288 --> 01:42:26.569]  The wall was almost completed.
[01:42:27.651 --> 01:42:32.675]  And then the Democrats come in, stop the wall, open the border, promise free handouts, it becomes a crisis again.
[01:42:32.675 --> 01:42:33.255]  And what do they say?
[01:42:33.255 --> 01:42:36.097]  They blame Trump.
[01:42:36.097 --> 01:42:37.698]  They blame Trump.
[01:42:37.698 --> 01:42:38.819]  Seriously, how does it end?
[01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:41.401]  I really always wonder, though.
[01:42:41.401 --> 01:42:47.405]  How does it end with an entire political party that spews nothing but lies 24-7?
[01:42:47.405 --> 01:42:50.227]  How does that end?
[01:42:50.227 --> 01:42:54.870]  How does that end when the media and the Democrat Party lie to you 24-7, 100% of the time?
[01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:55.611]  Where is the end of this?
[01:43:01.187 --> 01:43:06.171]  Look, I've proven that InfoWars information is some of the best in the world.
[01:43:06.171 --> 01:43:08.673]  It's just absolutely on target.
[01:43:08.673 --> 01:43:11.716]  The globalists can't stand us because we've studied how they operate.
[01:43:11.716 --> 01:43:13.237]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[01:43:13.237 --> 01:43:18.041]  I believe in humanity and I want to see you empowered because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[01:43:18.041 --> 01:43:20.923]  A raising tide raises all ships.
[01:43:20.923 --> 01:43:21.184]  Now...

[01:43:57.744 --> 01:44:01.687]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[01:44:01.687 --> 01:44:04.309]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodine?
[01:44:04.309 --> 01:44:05.069]  Why do you do that?
[01:44:05.069 --> 01:44:08.011]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[01:44:08.011 --> 01:44:09.833]  If we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say,
[01:44:10.799 --> 01:44:19.605]  A lot of people love Deep Earth Pure Crystal Iodine, but you should put one out with Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[01:44:19.605 --> 01:44:19.845]  Boom!
[01:44:19.845 --> 01:44:20.245]  We did it.
[01:44:20.245 --> 01:44:20.745]  It's popular.
[01:44:20.745 --> 01:44:21.506]  It's X3.
[01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:22.747]  Is it better than X2?
[01:44:22.747 --> 01:44:23.407]  You decide.
[01:44:23.407 --> 01:44:24.888]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[01:44:24.888 --> 01:44:29.031]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular Powdered Pill
[01:44:29.892 --> 01:44:30.632]  Sleep Aid.
[01:44:30.632 --> 01:44:32.074]  And that is down and out.
[01:44:32.074 --> 01:44:33.335]  It's super strong.
[01:44:33.335 --> 01:44:35.217]  Way stronger than knockout.
[01:44:35.217 --> 01:44:36.759]  But they don't compete with each other.
[01:44:36.759 --> 01:44:38.641]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:44:38.641 --> 01:44:39.461]  Different formulas.

[01:44:58.644 --> 01:45:00.165]  The people are awakening.
[01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:02.887]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[01:45:02.887 --> 01:45:04.949]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[01:45:04.949 --> 01:45:07.290]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:13.955]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this.
[01:45:14.235 --> 01:45:25.518]  To steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[01:45:25.518 --> 01:45:32.240]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.661]  In their own words, they admit it.
[01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:38.102]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:41.183]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:45:41.183 --> 01:45:43.404]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:46:05.825 --> 01:46:13.472]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:46:13.472 --> 01:46:19.238]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[01:46:19.238 --> 01:46:30.849]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:46:31.449 --> 01:46:33.590]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:37.692]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:46:37.692 --> 01:46:48.296]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:48.296 --> 01:46:57.840]  Whether it's high-quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:58.500]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:01.252 --> 01:47:03.896]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:14.369 --> 01:47:18.732]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:23.375]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:23.375 --> 01:47:26.557]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:26.557 --> 01:47:29.919]  We're in the final segment of this Sunday's Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.919 --> 01:47:32.901]  Don't forget Harrison Smith coming up with Sunday Night Live.
[01:47:32.901 --> 01:47:38.784]  Normally hosted by yours truly, but Harrison Smith fulfilling those duties tonight as I'm in studio for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.784 --> 01:47:41.406]  He'll be back on air in studio tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:47:41.406 --> 01:47:42.787]  Central, God willing, with
[01:47:43.368 --> 01:47:44.349]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:44.349 --> 01:47:47.031]  Patrick Halley also coming up with Harrison Smith.
[01:47:47.031 --> 01:47:50.474]  There's going to be a lot of important information discussed there.
[01:47:50.474 --> 01:48:01.643]  And what I think I'm going to do is, because Alex likes it when we pitch to the other shows, so I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell a story at the beginning of the broadcast.
[01:48:01.643 --> 01:48:02.844]  Pitching to Harrison Smith.
[01:48:02.844 --> 01:48:04.826]  I'm going to get his response to it, but I'm going to tell the story.
[01:48:05.695 --> 01:48:12.961]  About something I experienced this weekend being out and about in Austin with some buddies now that the mask mandate is lifted.
[01:48:12.961 --> 01:48:19.886]  I experienced some pretty interesting stuff that I want to just run by Harrison before he gets into his stuff.
[01:48:19.886 --> 01:48:25.710]  So guys, I'll probably just come right back out there so we don't have to do another setup and I'll sit right out there and we'll transfer it to Harrison.
[01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:34.817]  But I do have some news to cover here before we give the baton to Harrison Smith to host Sunday Night Live.
[01:48:36.018 --> 01:48:38.639]  Here are some of the other headlines.
[01:48:38.639 --> 01:48:44.039]  Organization, which is a left-wing organization, the Slow Factory Foundation.
[01:48:44.039 --> 01:48:45.380]  I did some research into them.
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:52.061]  It doesn't seem that they're too, you know, sorted in their affairs or their affiliations, but it's a big left-wing crazy group.
[01:48:52.061 --> 01:48:55.441]  The guy that founds it likes to paint his fingernails.
[01:48:55.441 --> 01:48:56.862]  So that's cute.
[01:48:56.862 --> 01:49:03.423]  So Organization says sharing Oprah Winfrey interview memes is digital blackface.
[01:49:03.423 --> 01:49:05.123]  And so obviously that Oprah Winfrey
[01:49:06.165 --> 01:49:07.987]  Interview.
[01:49:07.987 --> 01:49:14.071]  The content of it, the subjects of discussion didn't really go viral, but the memes did.
[01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:19.074]  All the memes of Meghan Markle and all the memes of Oprah went mega viral.
[01:49:19.074 --> 01:49:22.577]  Nobody really knows or cares what they talked about, but the memes went viral.
[01:49:22.577 --> 01:49:31.623]  So that angers the left wing, because this is of course a propaganda event for them, and when the propaganda doesn't hit, but then it gets basically
[01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:39.604]  Spun and turned into propaganda against them with the Oprah Winfrey memes, of course then they start to panic.
[01:49:39.604 --> 01:49:46.467]  So the left wing says don't share Oprah Winfrey memes, that's digital blackface.
[01:49:46.467 --> 01:49:50.149]  Yes, and these people haven't gone completely insane though.
[01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:52.730]  Some people are realizing though that they've gone completely insane.
[01:49:52.730 --> 01:50:00.013]  Sarah Silverman, one of them, in an interesting podcast, I guess it's her own podcast, they all have podcasts now, nobody listens,
[01:50:00.609 --> 01:50:04.211]  But she says she doesn't want to be associated with the Democrat Party anymore.
[01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:07.752]  And you can tell it's like the most real I've ever seen Sarah Silverman.
[01:50:07.752 --> 01:50:13.235]  I mean, her party humor is real, but this was like kind of like down to earth real.
[01:50:13.235 --> 01:50:24.339]  And you could tell that there was Biden voter remorse or I don't know if she voted for Biden, but there was Biden promotion, Democrat Party promotion remorse.
[01:50:24.339 --> 01:50:27.661]  And you could tell that she's having this realization in this podcast.
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:30.641]  And now she doesn't want to be affiliated with parties.
[01:50:30.641 --> 01:50:31.961]  Shouldn't we be affiliated with any of it?
[01:50:31.961 --> 01:50:34.062]  She just wants to be... Yeah!
[01:50:34.062 --> 01:50:36.103]  Yeah, you figured out these people hate us, huh?
[01:50:36.103 --> 01:50:37.123]  You finally got it.
[01:50:37.123 --> 01:50:38.023]  Politicians are corrupt.
[01:50:38.023 --> 01:50:40.584]  You shouldn't be involved with any of these people.
[01:50:40.584 --> 01:50:44.686]  But Hollywood has been so in the tank for the Democrat Party for so long.
[01:50:46.694 --> 01:51:07.371]  But the weird thing that she mentions in here, and this is what I'm wanting liberals and leftists to realize, and this is why I'll tell the story with Harrison Smith coming up, and there's a bit of it in my street interview from last Monday at the mask event, but she's calling liberals absolutists in this, absolutists.
[01:51:07.371 --> 01:51:13.656]  The real world, the real world word that she's looking for is totalitarians.
[01:51:15.523 --> 01:51:18.530]  Absolutists is fair enough, but it's the same thing.
[01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:19.713]  They're totalitarians!
[01:51:20.552 --> 01:51:25.335]  So that's what it's time for the left wing to realize that that's what they've become.
[01:51:25.335 --> 01:51:28.878]  They want to force you to wear the mask and take a vaccine because they're totalitarians.
[01:51:28.878 --> 01:51:30.138]  They don't want you to open their business.
[01:51:30.138 --> 01:51:33.821]  They want to be in charge of when it's open or closed because they're totalitarians.
[01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:41.946]  They want to be in charge of your children, your movement, the thermostat in your house, the gas in your car.
[01:51:41.946 --> 01:51:43.968]  These are totalitarians.
[01:51:43.968 --> 01:51:48.611]  And it looks like maybe some of these libs that just kind of went along with the cause celeb
[01:51:49.577 --> 01:52:05.507]  are having the remorse and feeling bad and they won't be totally honest about it for their own pride but but it does look like they're beginning to take some steps back in some remorse of promoting the new world order totalitarianism.
[01:52:05.507 --> 01:52:16.794]  You know here's kind of an example of the nonsense though judge takes action on virtually unintelligible lawsuit against Trump and Israel and it's it's it's Palestinians that fire this lawsuit and it's just it's it's complete garbage
[01:52:17.518 --> 01:52:19.639]  And look, we deal with similar stuff here.
[01:52:19.639 --> 01:52:26.661]  They'll file lawsuits against us and it's like they use people's names that have never worked here or haven't worked here in years.
[01:52:26.661 --> 01:52:28.161]  They misspell names.
[01:52:28.161 --> 01:52:30.302]  They get people's identities confused.
[01:52:30.302 --> 01:52:32.423]  And it's just total drivel and garbage.
[01:52:32.423 --> 01:52:36.464]  But see, Democrat judges will still hear it.
[01:52:36.464 --> 01:52:39.425]  But that's basically what this Palestinian group tried to do to Trump and Israel.
[01:52:39.425 --> 01:52:41.045]  He's like, I don't even understand this lawsuit.
[01:52:41.045 --> 01:52:42.266]  Throw it out.
[01:52:42.266 --> 01:52:44.246]  Democrat judges will hear it though.
[01:52:44.246 --> 01:52:45.887]  More bad news for Cuomo.
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:49.861]  More bad news for Cuomo.
[01:52:49.861 --> 01:52:52.522]  Is this thing going to blow up?
[01:52:52.522 --> 01:53:00.025]  From the Washington Examiner, coronavirus infects 10,300 New York group home workers, killing 32.
[01:53:00.025 --> 01:53:04.327]  And it actually says it killed hundreds later on in the article.
[01:53:04.327 --> 01:53:07.388]  So I'm a little confused at the headline.
[01:53:07.388 --> 01:53:12.811]  The New York Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, which operates the group homes, also reported 552 resident deaths and 6,382 infections.
[01:53:18.211 --> 01:53:23.595]  They have the nursing homes that COVID got sent into by Cuomo.
[01:53:23.595 --> 01:53:32.961]  Now they realize Cuomo also sent the COVID into these developmental disabilities homes.
[01:53:32.961 --> 01:53:36.683]  Killing state workers and killing people with mental disabilities.
[01:53:36.683 --> 01:53:45.909]  So my goodness, the numbers of death, the New York nursing home slayer,
[01:53:46.833 --> 01:53:50.477]  Andrew Cuomo, the number of death on his name, on his tally.
[01:53:50.477 --> 01:53:55.562]  I mean, he's up there with some of the biggest tyrants of all time now.
[01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:56.883]  Wow.
[01:53:56.883 --> 01:54:01.027]  But he'll get brought down by some groping allegations or some harassment allegations.
[01:54:01.027 --> 01:54:02.769]  He's fighting them tooth and nail.
[01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:05.272]  And now I'm wondering if the only reason why Cuomo
[01:54:06.309 --> 01:54:15.595]  Is going slug for slug with the harassment complaints is because he knows more is going to come out about the COVID deaths that he caused.
[01:54:15.595 --> 01:54:22.699]  And so he wants all of that to come out first until the harassment allegations bring him down.
[01:54:22.699 --> 01:54:24.980]  Pretty slick if that's the case.
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:26.361]  House Democrats draw the line.
[01:54:27.139 --> 01:54:30.041]  They want no cooperation with any Republicans that question the election.
[01:54:30.041 --> 01:54:35.745]  Yeah, you're not allowed to question the election, you're not allowed to be a free thinker, but oh, Russian collusion was the biggest story ever.
[01:54:35.745 --> 01:54:39.788]  They spent millions of dollars investigating that, all the media propaganda on that.
[01:54:39.788 --> 01:54:42.230]  It was total fake news.
[01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:42.530]  U.S.
[01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.613]  National Guard soldier dies while stationed at U.S.
[01:54:45.613 --> 01:54:50.296]  Capitol as many are being poisoned with undercooked food and metal shavings in their food.
[01:54:50.296 --> 01:54:51.917]  It's a total disaster.
[01:54:51.917 --> 01:54:55.480]  Just like at the southern border, it's all Democrat Party politics, and it's killing people,
[01:54:56.337 --> 01:54:57.337]  And they don't care.
[01:54:57.337 --> 01:54:58.838]  They like it.
[01:54:58.838 --> 01:55:01.119]  They love when someone dies from their policies.
[01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:03.900]  It makes them feel in charge.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:08.302]  And Lloyd Austin said, we will not be removing the National Guard from D.C.
[01:55:08.302 --> 01:55:10.543]  even though the National Guard said there's no point in us being here.
[01:55:10.543 --> 01:55:14.765]  It's going to cost us half a billion dollars a year if we continue to do this.
[01:55:14.765 --> 01:55:15.545]  Well, they love that.
[01:55:16.559 --> 01:55:19.162]  Meanwhile, Biden's still yet to have a press conference.
[01:55:19.162 --> 01:55:20.783]  Won't even take questions from the media.
[01:55:20.783 --> 01:55:23.386]  They cut off his camera when he says he will.
[01:55:23.386 --> 01:55:25.388]  He asked for Pelosi's permission.
[01:55:25.388 --> 01:55:26.609]  Or he just says, what am I supposed to do?
[01:55:26.609 --> 01:55:27.710]  I don't know what I'm doing here.
[01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:28.551]  And then they cut the feed.
[01:55:28.551 --> 01:55:33.476]  50 days as president, Biden still has not given a news conference.
[01:55:33.476 --> 01:55:34.797]  Critics and allies wonder why.
[01:55:34.797 --> 01:55:36.218]  Well, the allies are starting to wonder why.
[01:55:36.218 --> 01:55:36.899]  The critics know why.
[01:55:38.571 --> 01:55:40.192]  Trump had, I think, five by now.
[01:55:40.192 --> 01:55:41.433]  Obama had three by now.
[01:55:41.433 --> 01:55:42.634]  Bush had three by now.
[01:55:42.634 --> 01:55:44.175]  Obama had... I'm sorry.
[01:55:44.175 --> 01:55:45.456]  Everybody does the press conferences.
[01:55:45.456 --> 01:55:47.517]  Biden won't even take a question from the media.
[01:55:47.517 --> 01:55:48.478]  And we all know why.
[01:55:48.478 --> 01:55:49.778]  There's no secret here.
[01:55:49.778 --> 01:55:53.961]  Biden, at the very minimum, is suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's.
[01:55:53.961 --> 01:56:00.165]  And he can't be trusted on a public microphone.
[01:56:00.165 --> 01:56:03.227]  So Trump gets censored from Twitter because he speaks the truth.
[01:56:03.227 --> 01:56:05.929]  Biden gets censored from talking to the media because he can't speak.
[01:56:08.326 --> 01:56:12.490]  So it's a total clown show.
[01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:17.774]  And we'll see how long Biden can go without having to answer questions from the media.
[01:56:17.774 --> 01:56:22.999]  But remember, when Psaki was asked why Biden won't address questions from the media, what did she say?
[01:56:22.999 --> 01:56:25.401]  Well, there's too many national crises going on.
[01:56:25.401 --> 01:56:27.703]  No, that's exactly when you address the media.
[01:56:27.703 --> 01:56:28.844]  Isn't that ironic?
[01:56:28.844 --> 01:56:32.307]  OK, by the way, Meghan Markle says she wants to run for president now.
[01:56:32.307 --> 01:56:32.908]  Have you heard this?
[01:56:33.934 --> 01:56:44.641]  Yes, Meghan Markle wants to run for president now, married to the fake Prince Harry, which it does appear, I mean, I don't want to jump the shark, but it does appear that it was actually the son of...
[01:56:46.216 --> 01:57:10.371]  Princess Diana's riding instructor, horse riding instructor, but I'm not going to get too conspiratorial on that, but the fake Prince Harry married to the briefcase model Meghan Markle, who gave it all up to be a princess, a fake princess, but didn't get what she wanted, and so now is trying to destroy the royal family, and she thinks she can run for office too, by the way, that's hilarious, but she promotes a yogurt company on the
[01:57:11.261 --> 01:57:25.707]  Oprah Winfrey interview, Humphrey Yogurt, uh, people look into this, and guys, go ahead and look at this logo, and I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the pedophile logo is in the Meghan Markle, uh, frozen yogurt company that she promoted.
[01:57:25.707 --> 01:57:28.768]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence, so please don't make a big fuss about that.
[01:57:30.483 --> 01:57:33.226]  Meanwhile, the COVID relief bill, $2 trillion.
[01:57:33.226 --> 01:57:39.273]  Did you know inside that bill is relief for farmers, but only if you're a farmer of color.
[01:57:39.273 --> 01:57:41.315]  So white farmers get nothing.
[01:57:41.315 --> 01:57:44.479]  Everybody else gets at least $5 billion in aid.
[01:57:44.479 --> 01:57:44.899]  Wow!
[01:57:44.899 --> 01:57:46.521]  Harrison Smith coming up with Sunday Night Live.
