[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.651]  It is clear this is a global extermination against humanity.
[00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:05.731]  It's in the early phases.
[00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:16.336]  It's going to accelerate, and they're going to combine multiple vectors of a grid-down collapse, an economic collapse, a second wave of biowarfare agents launched probably by Communist China.
[00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:37.103]  And I believe, based on my sources, once America is sufficiently weakened from within, with internal race wars, and perhaps a civil war if they can engineer that, and maybe nationwide gun confiscation attempts following a false flag attack, then the communists will literally invade the continental United States, perhaps through UN troops or communist Chinese troops,
[00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:46.694]  Working with narco cartels across the southern border, and I've got numerous sources confirming all of this, including the pre-staging of weapons in the United States.
[00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:51.700]  So, the American people are going to be fighting a multi-front war against invaders.
[00:00:52.601 --> 00:01:00.046]  against a rogue element of perhaps the military and bioweapons and a grid-down scenario all at the same time.
[00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:01.907]  This is all happening together by design.
[00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.868]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:05.029]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.150]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.071]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes into and Joe Rogan, Elon Musk?
[00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:10.312]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:11.193]  They tune in right here!
[00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:15.956]  InfoWars.
[00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:17.216]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:17.817]  Today.
[00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:33.262]  InfoWars.
[00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:34.504]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:35.245]  Today.
[00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:43.258]  It was a year ago that Michael Ryan, the head of the United Nations Global Rapid Reaction Force, said...
[00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:53.519]  The ultimate goal, which they've now carried out in more than 100 countries, is to go into your homes, forcibly test you, and take your loved ones away from you based on fraudulent PCR tests.
[00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.020]  This is martial law.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.025]  We now have major leaders in Canada saying they're using COVID to bring in martial law to silence dissent.
[00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.648]  They say it in national TV press conferences.
[00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:07.190]  They are going public with tyranny.
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.650]  And now,
[00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:20.332]  Biden has launched the COVID tracking teams in the name of the Delta tracking teams, the Delta plus variant tracking teams coming door to door to harass the unvaccinated.
[00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.356]  This is not the velvet glove and the iron fist.
[00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:25.019]  This is the iron fist.
[00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.703]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:43.445]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:54.365]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:02:55.865 --> 00:03:01.528]  It's now my great pleasure to invite Lady Gaga.
[00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.890]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick these people are.
[00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:13.886]  Casting themselves as the heroes, the rest of us as the evil disease spreaders.
[00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:22.050]  And now, Biden and White House deployed Delta variant response teams across the U.S.
[00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.151]  to communities with low vaccination rates.
[00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:31.154]  They're going to force their way into homes and quote, force people to be tested with fraudulent machines that are 94% false positive.
[00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:43.762]  And it's far worse than that already in Europe, Canada, places like Australia where they have been arresting people for a year that protest online the lockdowns.
[00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:44.863]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:46.964]  And big tech censors you as well.
[00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:50.146]  They also censor medical treatments, medical doctors.
[00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:59.712]  This is a giant exercise in raping our freedoms, raping our speech, raping our bodies, and forcing their deadly gene therapies into us.
[00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:03.574]  There can no longer be any doubt
[00:04:05.776 --> 00:04:10.380]  There can no longer be any doubt, ladies and gentlemen, of what's really going on.
[00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:18.228]  There's now CBS, ABC, NBC, they're all reporting on what I've been telling you for months.
[00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:29.299]  That, oh, it's funny, when people go in to get the shots at Walgreens or at Walmart or at CVS or at government facilities,
[00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.330]  They look at the person's race and go, oh, you're black.
[00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.510]  And they look at a clipboard and go, you're getting this shot.
[00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.090]  You're white, you're getting this one.
[00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.491]  You're Asian, you're getting this one.
[00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.012]  And they sometimes give them different vaccines and sometimes they go to different lots.
[00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:51.373]  And then of the supposed same Pfizer or Moderna or other, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they just went for broke.
[00:04:52.914 --> 00:04:54.634]  And here's the deal.
[00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:59.255]  If you saw that in a science fiction movie, you'd be like, how obvious it is that they're targeting certain groups.
[00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:02.587]  But they're killing black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.534]  But then certain vaccines you see are race specific, which they also admit.
[00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:16.000]  And it seems to be hitting black folks a lot harder than it's been hitting white folks, but it is killing a lot of white people as well.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.883]  This is so diabolical.
[00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:24.989]  And it's in the mainstream news articles what callers were calling in when the injections started six months ago.
[00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:32.743]  And it's like, hey, I'm black and I was at the Walgreens and I saw a black lady getting one vaccine and a white lady was getting another one.
[00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:36.083]  I got mainstream news going, we don't know why they're doing that!
[00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.184]  I mean, whoa!
[00:05:38.524 --> 00:05:40.105]  Who's giving the directives?
[00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:43.166]  Grab the clipboard, find out what the directions are!
[00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:44.427]  This is mass crime!
[00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:45.527]  This is mass murder!
[00:05:45.827 --> 00:05:46.608]  Holy hell!
[00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:56.932]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth, and I could just go on for about five hours here.
[00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:07.195]  Have all said on record they want to set up a world government with forced inoculations to then inject you with vaccines that bare minimum sterilize you.
[00:06:08.316 --> 00:06:13.141]  Now when I first read this in books in 1990 when I was still in high school,
[00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:21.154]  When I was a junior and then senior in high school, I thought, well, I'm not going to just believe this book put out by the John Birch Society.
[00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:32.597]  So I went down to the UT library, because local libraries didn't have it, and I pulled up the damn newspaper articles on the microfiche, and I read it right there with David Rockefeller and others saying it.
[00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:38.378]  And I thought, wow, a global government to forcibly inject me and sterilize my ass.
[00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:40.679]  I better do something about that.
[00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:44.861]  And here we are.
[00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:48.462]  I've been on air since 1995.
[00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:53.304]  And we've gone from the beta test to now living in the New World Order system.
[00:06:55.405 --> 00:06:57.466]  And believe me, this is the New World Order's world.
[00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.466]  This is Satan's world.
[00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:08.908]  I saw one of the big top black podcasters, right up there with Charlemagne, the God, that's what he calls himself, one of the other big guys.
[00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.750]  Charlemagne's actually said some nice things about me, I guess got heat for it.
[00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:20.797]  So yeah, I guess Jones is right about this or that, but this other big podcaster with millions of listeners today, I'll get to it later, he's like, Jones is a racist!
[00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:30.668]  And Jones shouldn't go on Andrew Schultz's show, and Andrew Schultz, because he co-hosts a show with a black guy, shouldn't be associated with other white people that are in the KKK, like Alex Jones.
[00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.489]  No proof, no evidence, they just say that.
[00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.612]  And he goes, yeah, Jones wants to get the black audience, he knows it's a black man's world.
[00:07:39.812 --> 00:07:40.993]  No, it's Satan's world.
[00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:46.738]  But again, all the corporate sponsors have black people as their front person now.
[00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:48.740]  Communist China does.
[00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:53.544]  All of it to hide their operations behind black people.
[00:07:53.584 --> 00:07:57.608]  And then black people, on average, I listen and watch the shows.
[00:07:57.628 --> 00:07:59.609]  I mean, I think these are entertaining shows, actually.
[00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.892]  And this particular host who was attacking me has an amazing voice.
[00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:05.334]  I mean, I can't quit listening to it, even though he's lying about me.
[00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:09.237]  I just want everybody to live in peace.
[00:08:09.377 --> 00:08:10.818]  I love him no matter what color he is.
[00:08:11.338 --> 00:08:13.658]  He's a dumbed-down anti-white racist.
[00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:14.719]  This host I'll get to later.
[00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:23.181]  It's one of the allied, you know, co-shows with Charlamagne that are right up there rivaling Joe Rogan, his biggest shows in America.
[00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:30.623]  And he's talking about, yeah, black people are taking over.
[00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:35.458]  Oh, you mean like the tens of millions extra that are starved to death since the lockdown?
[00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:37.479]  And it's designed to starve Africans?
[00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.639]  You mean you're taking over that way?
[00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:46.983]  So again, while black people are being exterminated, the black leadership of media, led by Oprah Winfrey, they think they're in charge.
[00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:59.222]  They think they know what's going on, and they think because every TV ad you'll see, and every show you see, and every corporate pitch person you see, I mean I'm talking about 90% is black!
[00:08:59.743 --> 00:09:02.485]  Like somebody flip the switch, that doesn't help black people!
[00:09:04.986 --> 00:09:08.468]  Fine, have people be black spokespersons, I don't care about that!
[00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.454]  It's the point of when it's suddenly nothing but black people, that's the globalist system
[00:09:18.962 --> 00:09:25.104]  Hiding behind black people, just like if you oppose gun control or open borders, well, you're a racist.
[00:09:25.224 --> 00:09:32.967]  Or if you're against forced inoculation, or you're against medical IDs, or you're against lockdowns.
[00:09:33.047 --> 00:09:45.252]  It says in the official report, in fact, guys, we pulled that out of my stack, put out two weeks ago by Biden, the official counterterrorism shift to the US is, if you don't like lockdowns, you are a terrorist, quote, white supremacist.
[00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:48.229]  Well, that's dumbed down.
[00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:49.089]  That doesn't even make sense.
[00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:52.270]  What does that have to do, not wanting a lockdown, with being a white supremacist?
[00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.972]  I can pull you up a thousand news articles with that headline.
[00:09:55.472 --> 00:09:57.653]  Protesting lockdown as white supremacist.
[00:09:59.514 --> 00:10:00.875]  This is a talking point.
[00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:04.016]  And it's so silly.
[00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:08.638]  Because if you pull back from it, you can see all of humanity is under attack.
[00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:11.580]  We need to come together against the globalists, and we've got Bill Gates.
[00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:29.018]  That says he wants to depopulate the planet, and he's running the vaccine program, and then they go out and they hire Run-DMC to cut all these cartoon videos for children, and the first one came out and said, fight the racists, take the shot.
[00:10:29.818 --> 00:10:37.026]  The next one said, fight the eugenicists and the depopulationists, and it shows him cutting down the eugenics tree.
[00:10:38.547 --> 00:10:39.268]  Take your shot.
[00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:45.912]  When you take the shot, what you're doing is basically giving yourself infertility, cancer, and so many other things.
[00:10:46.933 --> 00:11:03.685]  And I guess the argument is, I don't care if you're black or you're white, what color you are, if you're dumb enough to think Bill Gates loves you, and you really think Alex Jones is the bad guy, Bill Gates is the good guy, like this talk show host, well then I guess that's what you deserve.
[00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:07.008]  It's the Joe Buden.
[00:11:11.653 --> 00:11:12.653]  Joe Budden Show.
[00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:14.994]  Millions of viewers a day, even on YouTube.
[00:11:15.894 --> 00:11:17.975]  And I know he hosts one of the biggest shows out there.
[00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:31.858]  Calls out Andrew Schultz for having Alex Jones on Flagrant 2 and says, it's like a 10-minute rant, I'm not going to play the whole thing, that I'm the KKK and that Candace Owens better watch out being with us at the KKK.
[00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:38.720]  Oh, but he likes Joe Biden, who actually was in the KKK, the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.720]  But it doesn't even matter.
[00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:44.960]  It's Bill Gates and the Globalists attacking everybody, and here's the big news.
[00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.404]  I heard this six months ago from listeners that called in.
[00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:52.786]  And now it's in mainstream news.
[00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:55.428]  I have CBS, NBC, ABC, all of it right here.
[00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:02.654]  Links to it on InfoWars.com, an article about why are so many people being given saline when they go in to get a shot?
[00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:04.956]  I've talked to people in Army Special Operations.
[00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.818]  I've talked to people in the Coast Guard.
[00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:08.879]  I've talked to people that are medical doctors.
[00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:10.581]  I've talked to people that are federal employees.
[00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:17.762]  And they say they're given saline and they're told don't worry this is saline or they shoot the shot in the trash can.
[00:12:20.745 --> 00:12:32.154]  And of course it was over a month ago that they had testimony in Congress that half of the CDC employees including medical doctors and scientists and NIH, National Institutes of Health, will not take the shot.
[00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:33.095]  What does that tell you?
[00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:34.797]  But then it gets worse.
[00:12:34.877 --> 00:12:38.079]  I've got the articles right here where it's not just saline.
[00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:44.688]  When people go in to government facilities or major drug stores, they go, oh, hold on, you're black?
[00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:45.889]  Let me get this one for you.
[00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:47.730]  And they read literature, don't show you.
[00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.931]  Okay, this is the one for you.
[00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:50.572]  And if you're white, they give you another one.
[00:12:50.912 --> 00:12:54.995]  Are you going to hear a word out of the cool, racist, black guy?
[00:12:55.575 --> 00:13:11.928]  That said, oh, maybe the answer's segregating the black people from the white people, because he said, we rule the earth, everyone loves us, we're all the corporate sponsors, all the money's being dumped on us, man, we're so cool, and the white people want to be our friends, because it's a black planet.
[00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:21.355]  That's the power trip, to have the few black leaders paid off, to be talk show hosts, and then lead black people to be anti-white.
[00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:35.535]  So white people then become racist, and don't like blacks, and now everybody's divided and conquered, and it's all done in the name of unity, but it's the opposite, and meanwhile, this guy wouldn't know a racist if one walked up and bit him in the ass.
[00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:50.965]  I mean, I had Judge Joe Brown on, who by the way is coming on the Sunday show for a full hour, who was in a federal think tank back in the early 70s, who saw Joe Biden say black people are cockroaches.
[00:13:51.245 --> 00:13:54.746]  But you're not going to say a damn thing about that because you'll get cancelled, won't you?
[00:13:56.246 --> 00:13:59.166]  So you're a pimp, and I challenge you to debate.
[00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:07.568]  Come on my show, Joe, and tell me how I'm the KKK.
[00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.232]  Oh yeah, Alex Jones and all them, you know, black people think they can listen to them.
[00:14:14.572 --> 00:14:14.852]  Why?
[00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:25.256]  They're over there with the KKK, and if you want to be over there in the KKK, man, you need to be slapped upside your dumbass head for your own good.
[00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:26.697]  And I'm not saying I'm going to do that.
[00:14:27.017 --> 00:14:29.018]  My point is, what the hell's your problem?
[00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:34.720]  You don't even know who I am, but you get the talking point to try to police things and say, Andrew Schultz,
[00:14:37.486 --> 00:14:44.891]  Shouldn't have Alex Jones on because Andrew Schultz is a white guy we have on these shows and he shouldn't be on with the KKK guy.
[00:14:45.372 --> 00:14:50.115]  Meanwhile, there's Joe Biden with a former Grand Cyclops, Senator Byrd.
[00:14:50.496 --> 00:14:52.157]  That's the reality.
[00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:57.000]  And you work for those people.
[00:14:57.281 --> 00:15:03.325]  You work for big tech that lavishes you and promotes you and pushes you that runs death camps in China with the Uyghurs.
[00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:04.706]  That's on you, Joe!
[00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:08.959]  And you gotta face God for it!
[00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.360]  So you sit there and worship your KKK daddy.
[00:15:13.481 --> 00:15:14.562]  I hope you burn in hell.
[00:15:15.402 --> 00:15:16.162]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:21.005]  I was ranting and raving here on the Alex Jones Show last time about Joe Budden, who's a popular podcaster.
[00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:29.737]  Attacking me, basically saying I'm a KKK guy, I'm a racist, and Andrew Schultz, the popular comedian, shouldn't have me on his show.
[00:15:29.757 --> 00:15:31.399]  And I said, burn in hell.
[00:15:31.479 --> 00:15:34.122]  He's not as bad as Bill Gates or people like that.
[00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.824]  So I take that back and I repent of that.
[00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:40.428]  I hope his bad ideas burn, though, because it's a lie.
[00:15:41.516 --> 00:16:02.684]  And I really realize that we're all in this together, but I will not sit there and have racist black people who are feeding at the corporate New World Order, eugenics, death cult, genocide tit, lecture me about how I'm bad because I'm white, just because you are this black person paid by the corporate media to spew racism to divide this country and the world.
[00:16:02.744 --> 00:16:03.785]  I didn't do anything to you.
[00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:14.028]  I don't owe you anything and you are despicable lying about me while they are starving the third world to death, particularly Africa.
[00:16:14.429 --> 00:16:18.330]  And I have empathy for those Africans because I know what they're doing to them they're going to do to me.
[00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:27.993]  And I don't see a damn thing being said by all the trendy black leaders about what's happening with the starving of the third world.
[00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:29.234]  I don't care what color you are.
[00:16:31.206 --> 00:16:35.908]  You should understand that the lockdown is a major crime against humanity, and they're trying to bring it back in.
[00:16:35.948 --> 00:16:37.628]  The UN's saying, wear a mask again.
[00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:39.309]  The vaccines don't work.
[00:16:39.729 --> 00:16:41.930]  Oh, there's new variants, because it's a cold virus.
[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:50.353]  And they're keeping lockdowns in India and Africa that are starving millions of people who don't get enough to eat, so regular viruses kill them!
[00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:54.695]  This isn't a game, it's not a joke, it's real!
[00:16:55.589 --> 00:17:23.732]  And all these spoiled, rotten black people, Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, sit here in what's left of America, going along with the corporate tune that white people are inherently bad, while the very corporations running the world that just so happen to be run by a lot of rich Asians and white people, there's some black folks on board, look at Tetris, Tetris of the, Tedris of the WHO, total eugenicist, and they're establishing these contact tracing teams
[00:17:24.412 --> 00:17:35.374]  All over the world and going and grabbing people they claim didn't allow a vaccine or didn't do their PCR test and disappearing them into government facilities.
[00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:38.675]  That's called martial law and they're setting the precedent.
[00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:52.118]  And now Biden has announced these rapid reaction forces for the quote Delta variant plus response teams across the US to communities with low vaccination rates to come.
[00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:57.300]  To your door and start setting the precedent that they're coming to your door.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:17.015]  This is the coverage and the cover for their takeover and the UN has said they want the power to come and take you out of your house and disappear you and they've set up in Canada and other areas, Spain, Germany, France, the UK, Australia, everywhere.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:27.724]  Where when you land from out of the country, you spend 14 days locked in your hotel room, not even allowed out, and if you complain, well, they put you in prison.
[00:18:28.264 --> 00:18:39.009]  But, oh, government officials and footballers and movie stars, they can get a special government allotment and a little chip card they carry, and they're allowed to circumvent that.
[00:18:39.209 --> 00:18:40.950]  True discrimination.
[00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.372]  A new ruling class that is able to circumvent the law
[00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:54.262]  And put an oppressive, digital, medical, tyranny, martial law ID on us that they exempt themselves from.
[00:18:54.462 --> 00:19:11.771]  And I even played last week, hell, try to find it again guys, the member of the British Parliament who's on the Government Regulatory Board, and again, he was on national television and said, well of course important people aren't going to be restricted.
[00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:12.791]  It's 99% of all you!
[00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:17.355]  You see the seduction of that system?
[00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:22.258]  If you had a checklist for tyranny, they've checked every one of the boxes off.
[00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:27.761]  This is classic evil, classic martial law with a high-tech system of control.
[00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:29.382]  So here is the head.
[00:19:30.552 --> 00:19:36.438]  Of the UN program a year ago saying, we're going to come in your houses, we're going to take your families away from you.
[00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:39.601]  And now Biden is setting up the first waves of it.
[00:19:39.941 --> 00:19:41.523]  And guess who pays for these teams?
[00:19:41.603 --> 00:19:42.163]  They're private.
[00:19:42.904 --> 00:19:47.028]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gets taxpayer money and pays for it.
[00:19:47.589 --> 00:19:52.033]  And it goes to the Clinton Global Initiative that actually gets billions of dollars from it.
[00:19:52.493 --> 00:19:54.555]  So they also get rich while they screw us over.
[00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:54.916]  Here it is.
[00:19:55.691 --> 00:20:05.962]  At the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[00:20:06.642 --> 00:20:11.708]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:22.616]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:20:28.442 --> 00:20:34.006]  They send other political officers, the PCR test says you're positive, or if you resist, they take you to jail.
[00:20:34.326 --> 00:20:35.727]  They take you to secret camps.
[00:20:36.327 --> 00:20:38.249]  We told you about this a year ago, now it's confirmed.
[00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:39.930]  Secret camps in Australia.
[00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.031]  Secret camps in the UK.
[00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:43.472]  Secret camps in Europe.
[00:20:43.512 --> 00:20:44.833]  Secret camps in Canada.
[00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:47.455]  And they're passing laws to ban any speech they want.
[00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:58.282]  And major health ministers in Alberta and other areas are on TV saying, we're not letting the martial law ever go away because we're using this to stop people talking on the streets.
[00:20:58.922 --> 00:21:01.203]  Hi there, thanks for taking my questions.
[00:21:01.223 --> 00:21:10.888]  I'm wondering about the injunction banning public gatherings and whether there really is a need for such a far-reaching one given the trajectory we're on now.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.021]  I mean, I think it's still there.
[00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:29.342]  We still have, you know, bringing large numbers of people together.
[00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:32.623]  It can present some risk.
[00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.104]  We'll continue to look at that.
[00:21:35.244 --> 00:21:48.529]  But I think the other purpose of the injunction is to prevent, you know, groups that are spreading, deliberately spreading false information that can actually create risk.
[00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:52.652]  Okay, so you can't let people congregate because they might talk about how the ongoing lockdowns lie.
[00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:59.837]  And I have articles where there are islands off Canada where thousands of people live that have never been able to leave for a year and a half.
[00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:27.977]  There are small towns in Australia where they can get away with it, and the army just surrounds it and says, well, there's no cases in this town, so we might save one person in this town of 3,000 people, or this town of 800 people in one case, if we don't let anyone go in or out.
[00:22:28.338 --> 00:22:37.583]  And it's all just a test of total martial law, but if you're in the government or the military or the police, you get a special little card and you're the new super class.
[00:22:38.783 --> 00:22:41.125]  While we're all talking about black versus white all day.
[00:22:41.505 --> 00:22:43.306]  You know, Black Lives Matter is in Russia.
[00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:44.967]  Black Lives Matter is in Australia.
[00:22:45.287 --> 00:22:46.928]  Black Lives Matter is in Germany.
[00:22:47.028 --> 00:22:47.689]  It's in Mexico.
[00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:54.834]  It's the corporate system that's given tens of billions of dollars worldwide to say, we love black people.
[00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.636]  Do what we say corporately to save them.
[00:22:58.096 --> 00:22:58.976]  And what is the goal?
[00:22:59.197 --> 00:22:59.977]  No family.
[00:23:00.718 --> 00:23:03.720]  And get black men to become women.
[00:23:04.724 --> 00:23:06.005]  That's the main... Oh!
[00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:07.626]  What a loving group!
[00:23:07.646 --> 00:23:13.609]  So first they take your identity, buy off your leaders, like Margaret Sanger said 120 years ago.
[00:23:14.089 --> 00:23:15.530]  Her quotes are in the National Archives.
[00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:23.915]  She said, we're going to kill these human weeds, but first we've got to buy off the black leadership and get them under our control, then we will speak for the blacks.
[00:23:25.796 --> 00:23:26.877]  And she called you human weeds.
[00:23:27.944 --> 00:23:29.825]  So there we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:39.868]  I've got big news on the military front, the Ashley Babbitt front, the latest level in the Sovietization of Facebook, and so much more, and some big guests today.
[00:23:40.188 --> 00:23:45.810]  It's all straight ahead on the Alex Jones Show, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.710]  until 3 p.m.
[00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.151]  Central.
[00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:53.773]  I am here live in the most banned, demonized attack broadcast in the world because we are over the enemy target.
[00:23:55.049 --> 00:23:56.510]  We know how to stop the globalists.
[00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.191]  We know how to go to the next level in the human species.
[00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:00.032]  We know how to win.
[00:24:00.752 --> 00:24:05.755]  So if you want to live, you want to prosper, you don't want to be a slave, listen to us, check out everything we say.
[00:24:05.795 --> 00:24:06.375]  Don't believe us?
[00:24:06.935 --> 00:24:07.516]  Research it.
[00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:17.241]  Now, somebody that says don't research it and just believe us is Tracy Edwards, a commissioner in New York City for Long Island.
[00:24:18.746 --> 00:24:20.227]  Remember her six months ago?
[00:24:20.247 --> 00:24:22.069]  She said, I don't want to know what's in it.
[00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.371]  I don't want to ask any questions.
[00:24:24.412 --> 00:24:27.955]  Just give me the injection.
[00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:28.596]  Here it is.
[00:24:31.198 --> 00:24:32.900]  COVID has devastated this state.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:41.148]  Long Island continues to be one of the hardest hit regions, especially for our black and brown New Yorkers.
[00:24:42.603 --> 00:24:45.225]  We must take the vaccine.
[00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.548]  Now I'm going to tell you a personal story, off script.
[00:24:49.649 --> 00:24:55.633]  So today, right after this, I am going to have an infusion.
[00:24:56.874 --> 00:25:05.461]  And I'm going to have an infusion because I want to make sure that the cancer that was in my body does not return.
[00:25:07.202 --> 00:25:10.405]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion.
[00:25:12.228 --> 00:25:16.351]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[00:25:17.512 --> 00:25:21.676]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[00:25:23.277 --> 00:25:25.899]  And that's what we have to do.
[00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:28.921]  Our communities take insulin.
[00:25:30.022 --> 00:25:30.943]  That's enough.
[00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:32.785]  Oh, which is approved and known.
[00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:34.226]  Been around for a hundred years.
[00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:39.310]  This is a secret, unapproved program that's been banned all over the world.
[00:25:40.782 --> 00:25:42.224]  Here's just some of the headlines today.
[00:25:43.665 --> 00:25:47.589]  New study links acute chest pain in male soldiers to mRNA vaccines.
[00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:49.872]  They've already put warnings on it saying it'll make you have a heart attack.
[00:25:51.654 --> 00:25:54.417]  Norway to pay compensation for AstraZeneca side effects.
[00:25:54.677 --> 00:25:55.698]  Heart attacks and strokes.
[00:25:58.481 --> 00:26:01.605]  And it goes on and on and on from there.
[00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:03.534]  This is just the news today.
[00:26:04.035 --> 00:26:04.775]  Look at this headline.
[00:26:05.195 --> 00:26:10.538]  British rocker dies from brain hemorrhage two weeks after AstraZeneca injection.
[00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:13.479]  Here's another one.
[00:26:14.499 --> 00:26:15.640]  New England Medical Journal.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.821]  Depopulation alert.
[00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:28.485]  Shocking new study reveals COVID vaccine terminates four out of five pregnancies via spontaneous abortions or 82% of the women had a miscarriage after they took the damn shot.
[00:26:29.086 --> 00:26:29.506]  Wow!
[00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:31.947]  I mean, that is some mean-ass poison.
[00:26:33.584 --> 00:26:36.347]  A woman can take a pretty big dose of arsenic and still keep a baby.
[00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:43.074]  A woman can drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every day, and 99% of the time she keeps that baby.
[00:26:44.676 --> 00:26:52.365]  Might have fetal alcohol syndrome, but you take that shot 82% of the time, double X in them eyes.
[00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:53.346]  Dead baby.
[00:26:58.786 --> 00:27:00.628]  They got a lot of nerve.
[00:27:00.668 --> 00:27:02.489]  Yeah, let's show you some of these medical doctors and people.
[00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.910]  Oh, I'm getting my shot.
[00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:04.791]  I'm 35 weeks pregnant.
[00:27:05.152 --> 00:27:07.133]  Two weeks later, bye-bye baby!
[00:27:08.474 --> 00:27:09.095]  She's proud of it.
[00:27:09.115 --> 00:27:14.460]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.144]  Yeah, I got to show them the article then where she took the shot and then boom, bye-bye baby.
[00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:24.728]  So, I mean, I've got stacks of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:24.748 --> 00:27:26.250]  I mean, here's the damn study right here.
[00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:29.210]  We'll just actually show you the study.
[00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.390]  Oh, just the article.
[00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.730]  Here it is.
[00:27:31.371 --> 00:27:34.612]  Findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine study in pregnant persons.
[00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:36.393]  New England Medical Journal.
[00:27:37.254 --> 00:27:38.274]  82% death rate.
[00:27:40.695 --> 00:27:42.576]  I mean, hell, a rattlesnake only kills you.
[00:27:43.337 --> 00:27:43.857]  Let me guess.
[00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:46.818]  What percentage of rattlesnake bites are fatal?
[00:27:46.858 --> 00:27:47.038]  Maybe 5%?
[00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:47.639]  I'm guessing.
[00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:53.302]  I remember reading a study years ago that water moccasins kill more people in the U.S.
[00:27:53.342 --> 00:27:54.323]  than rattlesnakes.
[00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:56.285]  Guys, type in, just see the national statistic.
[00:27:56.825 --> 00:27:59.328]  Percentage of people bitten by a rattlesnake that die.
[00:27:59.348 --> 00:27:59.608]  I bet it's 5%.
[00:27:59.788 --> 00:28:02.050]  I bet it's less than 10%.
[00:28:02.691 --> 00:28:06.014]  But you take the shot, 82% chance your baby is dead.
[00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:09.277]  Oh, but I forgot.
[00:28:10.896 --> 00:28:14.799]  They got big national talk show hosts saying I'm in the KKK with no evidence.
[00:28:15.599 --> 00:28:16.440]  Oh, listen to him!
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.361]  Take your shot if you're in the KKK!
[00:28:18.381 --> 00:28:21.043]  They're like, what does that have to do with the KKK?
[00:28:21.783 --> 00:28:23.845]  That I don't want to be in lockdowns and forced inoculations.
[00:28:23.905 --> 00:28:37.894]  Well, I've got the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism right here, put out two weeks ago, and it says you are a white supremacist and then they call that terrorism if you don't want lockdowns or forced inoculations.
[00:28:38.114 --> 00:28:38.755]  Says it right here!
[00:28:40.848 --> 00:28:44.669]  And if you're that 80% of Republicans that question the election, it says you're a terrorist right here too!
[00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:47.610]  Let me show you.
[00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.151]  I probably showed you 10 times, but I can show you.
[00:28:51.171 --> 00:28:52.972]  On the page again.
[00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:55.452]  I guess they reprinted it for me.
[00:28:55.492 --> 00:28:56.593]  This is not my highlighted copy.
[00:28:59.053 --> 00:29:00.494]  Oh yes, the threat assessment section.
[00:29:00.534 --> 00:29:01.034]  Yes, that's it.
[00:29:02.354 --> 00:29:02.894]  Let me show you that.
[00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:04.795]  I can put it on screen for you.
[00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:08.236]  Because this is a declaration of war against the American people.
[00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.573]  Oh wow, only 0.2% out of 500 venomous snake bites result in death.
[00:29:15.074 --> 00:29:16.635]  Guess that's because of the treatments and antivenom.
[00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:17.255]  Okay, so see?
[00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:23.780]  So see, how many times more dangerous is an mRNA shot to a baby and its mother?
[00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:27.363]  Guys, average 0.2 into 82%?
[00:29:27.463 --> 00:29:36.790]  I mean, I think it's fair to say hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times safer to be bit by a rattlesnake.
[00:29:38.183 --> 00:29:40.324]  That it is to take a COVID vaccine if you're a baby.
[00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:57.516]  Oh, but don't worry, they got liberals lined up around the block to give their newborn babies the injection in an experimental program because they want to virtue signal what heroes they are because they have no damn common sense.
[00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:01.944]  Alright, I mentioned it, so let's play it.
[00:30:01.984 --> 00:30:13.510]  We've got lots of new news, but I don't want to just say there's a Member of Parliament and a major medical advisor to the government saying, well of course famous people aren't going to have to be quarantined when they come to the country, like footballers or people.
[00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.071]  Again, this is the model for the world.
[00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:19.813]  What you see in the UK, what you see in Canada, is for us next if we put up with it.
[00:30:20.813 --> 00:30:25.716]  We just aren't as sheepish, I'm sorry, as the folks living in the UK or Canada, but they're getting us lined up for it.
[00:30:25.776 --> 00:30:26.116]  Here it is.
[00:30:27.277 --> 00:30:29.378]  Davis has called that morally inconsistent.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:39.053]  Well, we've always said that for some people who are important, you know, players for instance.
[00:30:39.073 --> 00:30:40.857]  So people who want to go on holiday are not important?
[00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:41.939]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:44.099]  No, of course not.
[00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:51.522]  But we're talking, you know, we're talking a very limited number of people who are coming in and they're also subject still to quite significant restrictions.
[00:30:51.542 --> 00:30:53.884]  They're not just able to come in and travel around Britain.
[00:30:53.904 --> 00:30:56.945]  They come in to attend a mass... Oh, that's enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:57.826 --> 00:31:01.988]  So imagine if you can say no freedom till every COVID case in the world is eradicated.
[00:31:02.248 --> 00:31:03.008]  That's impossible.
[00:31:03.368 --> 00:31:07.831]  Set up for a UN global government power grab and I told you it'll never end.
[00:31:08.371 --> 00:31:14.174]  Every time opposition mounts, they will loosen the restrictions some, and as soon as opposition dies, clamp back down.
[00:31:14.714 --> 00:31:16.355]  And now exactly as I told you has happened.
[00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:19.696]  This is a permanent, unending emergency.
[00:31:19.996 --> 00:31:29.461]  Taking your speech, your medical rights, and next your money with carbon taxes, which they're now putting in place, that will bankrupt the West even further, and complete our journey into slavery.
[00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:36.504]  You'll be obsolete, you'll be non-essential, you'll have no job, they'll be able to dictate to you to take deadly poison inoculations,
[00:31:37.424 --> 00:31:39.645]  Or you will not get your universal income.
[00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:40.865]  That is the plan.
[00:31:41.305 --> 00:31:42.206]  Make you obsolete.
[00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:43.206]  Make you a captive.
[00:31:43.306 --> 00:31:44.747]  Make you under their control.
[00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:48.828]  If you try to organize against it, you're a white supremacist.
[00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:51.189]  And you're like, that doesn't have any logic.
[00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:52.969]  Well, what does the new Logitech ad say?
[00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:53.970]  With little Nos.
[00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.770]  It's time to stop logic.
[00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.471]  It's time to stop being logical.
[00:31:57.771 --> 00:31:59.132]  Suspend your own common sense.
[00:31:59.312 --> 00:32:00.172]  Let us kill you!
[00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:04.111]  So that's the plan here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:04.974 --> 00:32:08.305]  And it's absolutely, completely out of control.
[00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:12.042]  Separately, we can save the planet.
[00:32:12.102 --> 00:32:13.283]  We can defeat the globalists.
[00:32:13.463 --> 00:32:14.564]  We've got to beat them now.
[00:32:14.604 --> 00:32:15.685]  We've got to expose them now.
[00:32:16.165 --> 00:32:18.046]  Record low numbers have taken their poison shot.
[00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:19.487]  People are waking up everywhere.
[00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:21.828]  The globalists are really concerned and they admit they are.
[00:32:22.089 --> 00:32:23.329]  They hit us with everything they've got.
[00:32:23.429 --> 00:32:24.310]  This is their takeover.
[00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.711]  This is their world government.
[00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:26.691]  This is their medical ID.
[00:32:26.932 --> 00:32:30.294]  This is their implantable microchip plan that Klaus Schwab says is the plan.
[00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:31.815]  You say, we don't want the plan.
[00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:32.975]  They go, Jones is crazy.
[00:32:33.015 --> 00:32:34.156]  He says they want to put chips in you.
[00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:36.938]  Next up on 60 Minutes, everybody's going to have chips.
[00:32:38.976 --> 00:32:39.597]  So it's here.
[00:32:39.617 --> 00:32:41.600]  You're in the year 2021.
[00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:43.223]  Everything accelerates from here on.
[00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:44.826]  Submission is death.
[00:32:45.226 --> 00:32:46.248]  Resistance is life.
[00:32:46.929 --> 00:32:48.291]  Submitting to tyranny is death.
[00:32:48.832 --> 00:32:50.155]  Resisting tyranny is life.
[00:32:51.664 --> 00:32:53.787]  You have nothing to lose but fighting back.
[00:32:54.187 --> 00:32:56.130]  Nothing to lose but stop caring what they say.
[00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.993]  Nothing to lose unless you roll over.
[00:32:59.033 --> 00:33:00.595]  Then you will be annihilated.
[00:33:00.655 --> 00:33:01.116]  Stay with us.
[00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:08.745]  Alright, let me lay out some major truths that are very, very simple, but are earth-shattering if you understand them and apply them.
[00:33:09.773 --> 00:33:24.281]  The globalists are collapsing the world economy, the family, our health, our institutions, by design, because they don't want an upwardly mobile, egalitarian, classically liberal, free, open society.
[00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:31.645]  So they have to pose as the liberals to control all those classical Christian-inspired institutions.
[00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:39.254]  Liberal means a bigger swimming pool, a nicer college, more food to eat, more libraries.
[00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:43.615]  Just in classic definition, liberal means less censorship.
[00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.776]  Liberal means more guns, more self-defense.
[00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:49.657]  Liberal means nicer living accommodations.
[00:33:50.677 --> 00:33:52.758]  The problem is it creates decadent, dumbed-down people.
[00:33:52.778 --> 00:33:53.398]  It is a cycle.
[00:33:53.858 --> 00:33:58.000]  And what comes at the end of the cycle is absolute tyranny, mass die-off, and extermination.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.541]  And the globalists understand that, so they've decided to artificially accelerate that.
[00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:19.651]  Instead of having giant wars, where we all kill each other, they're going to have the globalist corporate system direct new types of war, psychological, cultural, financial, to basically poison and kill us slowly.
[00:34:21.032 --> 00:34:22.832]  And so they bake it into the cake.
[00:34:23.953 --> 00:34:28.474]  It's a little taste of Armageddon, to quote the old 1960s Star Trek piece.
[00:34:29.955 --> 00:34:31.655]  And that's where we are.
[00:34:32.115 --> 00:34:33.436]  A little taste of Armageddon.
[00:34:34.397 --> 00:34:39.101]  But it's a lot more than a little taste, and they've written thousands of books admitting all this.
[00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:47.848]  That's what's so frustrating, is people keep thinking like, oh, you tune into Alex Jones, you're getting his perspective, you're getting his view.
[00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:52.872]  When it comes to the big issues, no, we're dead on.
[00:34:52.932 --> 00:34:57.876]  We know the globalist program, and with every passing day, it becomes more their world.
[00:34:59.117 --> 00:35:01.199]  It becomes more their system.
[00:35:03.183 --> 00:35:04.364]  Do we have a total world government?
[00:35:04.484 --> 00:35:05.764]  Do we have a total technocracy?
[00:35:06.064 --> 00:35:07.465]  Do we have a total eugenics program?
[00:35:07.645 --> 00:35:07.805]  No.
[00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:11.927]  But they are, in afterburners, blasting us towards it right now.
[00:35:13.088 --> 00:35:14.089]  Now, overhead shot please.
[00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:16.530]  A lot of Jeffrey Epstein news is coming up.
[00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.132]  And they always had this virus scare program on the books.
[00:35:21.012 --> 00:35:23.953]  We've covered that, Operation Lockstep and others, Crimson Contagion.
[00:35:24.314 --> 00:35:25.794]  But why did they go ahead and pull the trigger?
[00:35:25.814 --> 00:35:27.395]  Because a lot of folks thought this was dangerous.
[00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:28.736]  They thought it would backfire.
[00:35:29.176 --> 00:35:32.258]  Why did they pull this asymmetrical, fifth-generational,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.601]  Warfare operation that has so many blowback problems to it.
[00:35:39.082 --> 00:35:51.247]  Because internally there were good networks in Europe, in the US, in South America, in Africa, in Asia, that don't want to go with the evil eugenics model of human extermination and controlled war, who wanted prosperity.
[00:35:52.850 --> 00:36:05.670]  And Trump and others and myself and you were leading the fight against the globalist model of planned destruction, instead believing in a laissez-faire pro-human future.
[00:36:07.435 --> 00:36:11.836]  But under the carbon taxes, under the global government, they collapse the planet.
[00:36:12.276 --> 00:36:13.237]  It's simple mathematics.
[00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:18.278]  They shut down the industries and the third world starts to die in mass.
[00:36:18.678 --> 00:36:26.680]  Then what's left of them is organized to flood the first world and be organized into political units to be used against us to finally take down the country.
[00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:35.183]  That's why the Border Patrol told us they estimate 10 million people just in the Texas Laredo sector
[00:36:36.564 --> 00:36:42.326]  The Rio Grande sector, our border with Mexico, this year by October, that's fiscal year.
[00:36:42.686 --> 00:36:43.947]  Federal year ends in October.
[00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:47.468]  They pass the budget and it starts over in December.
[00:36:49.649 --> 00:36:50.389]  That's $10 million.
[00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:55.551]  That's bigger than ever came to this country in one year before or in three years, in just one sector.
[00:36:56.957 --> 00:36:59.358]  You go down there, it looks like a giant industrial camp.
[00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:02.439]  Huge tents, huge buildings, thousands of vehicles.
[00:37:03.379 --> 00:37:07.000]  Just our government delivering all these people in that the Democrats fully control.
[00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:10.042]  Many of them don't even know, aren't with their parents, being smuggled.
[00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:16.964]  I mean, it's just mass crime, the collapse of the country, illustrated in full blazing neon for you.
[00:37:18.953 --> 00:37:24.556]  So that's why when AOC said two years ago, in 12 years, all society will collapse, we'll all be dead.
[00:37:25.116 --> 00:37:28.798]  When Beto said, in 12 years, everything will collapse, we'll all be dead.
[00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:38.704]  They're telling Beto and her in meetings that, oh, the earth has hit this number, we have these computer programs, just like Enron ran scam programs to show Congress people before.
[00:37:40.134 --> 00:37:49.287]  They show them these scam computer programs, and they actually believe, the higher level left, not the highest level, but the high level, actually believe the world's ending.
[00:37:49.888 --> 00:37:54.174]  And that mass extermination's about to happen, because the carrying capacity of the Earth died.
[00:37:55.199 --> 00:38:04.042]  And they tell you, oh, new viruses are going to emerge because of global warming, and wipe out billions, and giant fires, and the third world's all going to starve to death.
[00:38:04.362 --> 00:38:14.686]  Then they shut off the third world, and all the food we import, and the flowers, doesn't sound like a big deal, but a lot of people survive working on flower farms in Latin America, and particularly Africa.
[00:38:15.687 --> 00:38:19.008]  And the mining and everything else came to a stop.
[00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:23.750]  In the average African country, 60% of your money spent on food,
[00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.160]  And you don't have a job, you starve to death.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.261]  And so then the AOC says, look, Africa's starving.
[00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:33.282]  We need to give the UN more money.
[00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:35.002]  When the UN ran the program to do it.
[00:38:36.183 --> 00:38:37.723]  Then they organize them and bring them here.
[00:38:38.063 --> 00:38:39.384]  And they're desperate, and they're scared.
[00:38:39.584 --> 00:38:41.505]  And the UN tells them, white people are bad.
[00:38:41.685 --> 00:38:42.125]  Attack them.
[00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:44.207]  White people deserve to die.
[00:38:44.768 --> 00:38:45.788]  No white person's good.
[00:38:45.828 --> 00:38:54.171]  And the universities are teaching that, to then bring in giant groups of desperate people, like a zombie apocalypse, to be used to bring down what's left of the West.
[00:38:54.291 --> 00:38:55.811]  And then the globalists have won.
[00:38:56.071 --> 00:39:04.754]  They'll have high-tech, armored corporate reservations, with all the luxury, all the medicine, all the systems, and we'll be outside, starving to death.
[00:39:07.455 --> 00:39:08.936]  And now you understand the rest of the story.
[00:39:08.956 --> 00:39:09.876]  So here's Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:39:11.397 --> 00:39:12.377]  This was all coming out.
[00:39:13.595 --> 00:39:24.037]  Good forces were exposing worldwide pedophile rings run by criminal elements that had taken over the CIA, the Mossad, and MI6.
[00:39:24.217 --> 00:39:27.078]  And it's well known in England, they run everything off pedophile rings.
[00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.538]  Israel's now run off pedophile rings at the top.
[00:39:29.858 --> 00:39:31.318]  The US has run off pedophile rings.
[00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:34.139]  The Vatican's run off pedophile rings.
[00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:38.720]  And you've got major pedophile rings, only three or four of them,
[00:39:39.622 --> 00:39:43.243]  That are controlling the entire planet right now.
[00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:46.723]  And so busting these up will bring down their network.
[00:39:47.104 --> 00:39:55.625]  So when we started busting their network up, they just released their virus, did their global lockdown they already planned, and started the planetary countdown to collapse.
[00:39:57.266 --> 00:40:01.406]  That's why they're accelerating printing all the money now at warp speed and only giving it to themselves.
[00:40:02.047 --> 00:40:08.488]  So they get value to buy up companies, buy up land, buy up farmland, buy up infrastructure, buy up patents, buy up weapon systems.
[00:40:09.983 --> 00:40:14.027]  Buy up all their competition to just shut tens of thousands of U.S.
[00:40:14.067 --> 00:40:19.491]  and European companies down and just send people home so that they buy the companies just to close them!
[00:40:21.193 --> 00:40:23.054]  Because they're using money as a weapon.
[00:40:23.775 --> 00:40:26.517]  Because they have multiple quadrillions of fake money.
[00:40:26.818 --> 00:40:27.919]  And so now we've reached that.
[00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:31.642]  I was talking to one of my lawyers, great guy, Norm Pattis, up in the Northeast this morning.
[00:40:31.682 --> 00:40:33.864]  He said he goes to the grocery store, it looks like Russia.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.102]  Almost half the shelves are completely empty.
[00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:40.584]  There's basic stuff hasn't been there for months because it's a breakdown.
[00:40:40.844 --> 00:40:42.285]  It's already beginning.
[00:40:43.366 --> 00:40:44.667]  The prices are exploding.
[00:40:44.968 --> 00:40:45.828]  It's a takedown.
[00:40:45.988 --> 00:40:47.009]  Look at these articles I have.
[00:40:47.529 --> 00:40:52.874]  More than 40% of San Franciscans to leave this year say the city is deteriorating, collapsing.
[00:40:53.314 --> 00:40:54.295]  It's a plan!
[00:40:54.515 --> 00:40:56.356]  They're collapsing everything!
[00:40:57.697 --> 00:40:59.579]  It's going to take decades to kill everybody.
[00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:02.041]  They're going to reorganize after it's all over.
[00:41:02.421 --> 00:41:03.682]  You better get ready, people.
[00:41:07.947 --> 00:41:11.009]  I got my last offer a year ago from the globalists to stop now.
[00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:12.730]  They were going to have to get me.
[00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.431]  I don't know what that means.
[00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:16.492]  Indictment or being killed.
[00:41:17.013 --> 00:41:19.494]  I can't sign on to satanism and starving and killing everybody.
[00:41:20.234 --> 00:41:30.621]  But as I watch the ship go down, I'll see the black face of the New World Order, which they use, the New World Order put blackface on, saying, look, all our spokesperson are black, do what we say, we're black.
[00:41:32.892 --> 00:41:40.742]  And I'll get to be criticized as the whole human ship goes down by the black talk show host declaring how wonderful everything is and how it's a black planet.
[00:41:42.324 --> 00:41:43.025]  Isn't that sick?
[00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:45.788]  But I'm gonna fight on to the end.
[00:41:46.229 --> 00:41:47.570]  We got some good news and some bad news.
[00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:55.632]  People are really listening to us about X2 and X3, the deep-earth halogen, deep-earth crystals, highest quality iodine, two different formulas, both excellent.
[00:41:56.032 --> 00:41:57.812]  One is 60% off, one is 50% off.
[00:41:58.372 --> 00:42:05.854]  We have a limited supply of it, so I'm forced to sell on sale, just to sell it to fund ourselves, so we're self-funding, but then having trouble getting more in.
[00:42:06.194 --> 00:42:16.016]  So if you want X2 or X3 discounted, with free shipping and double Patriot points, we're gonna have to end the sale on X3 probably tomorrow, if not Sunday, because it's almost sold out.
[00:42:16.857 --> 00:42:19.666]  Uh, it'll definitely go back to full price by Sunday, whatever's left of it.
[00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:21.210]  Then it's months and months till more comes in.
[00:42:22.113 --> 00:42:22.996]  And then we've got X.
[00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:26.470]  We're good to go.
[00:42:48.548 --> 00:42:51.689]  And so much more at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:52.209 --> 00:42:53.469]  And that's what keeps us on air.
[00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:54.730]  These are amazing products.
[00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.530]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.511]  Without you, we cannot fund this operation.
[00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:01.911]  Turbo Forces back in, 40% off.
[00:43:02.231 --> 00:43:03.852]  DNA Force Plus, 40% off.
[00:43:04.192 --> 00:43:05.252]  Bodies back in stock.
[00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:05.972]  I forgot about that.
[00:43:05.992 --> 00:43:07.073]  40% off.
[00:43:07.113 --> 00:43:07.633]  That's huge.
[00:43:07.713 --> 00:43:08.553]  I need to talk about that.
[00:43:09.133 --> 00:43:10.513]  All at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:10.953 --> 00:43:12.054]  Couldn't be a more important message.
[00:43:12.094 --> 00:43:12.754]  Please keep us on air.
[00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:18.995]  I feel tears welling up, calling deep inside, like my heart sprung a big break.
[00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:25.240]  And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful, that I may never shake.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:30.284]  Now you might say that I was taking it hard, since you wrote me off with a call.
[00:43:30.905 --> 00:43:35.769]  But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow, when I'm a red-eyed down and bow.
[00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:44.494]  Alright, here's what I want to do.
[00:43:45.875 --> 00:43:54.340]  I want to open the phones up in the next segment on any subject you want to cover, any question you got, any point you make if you disagree with me.
[00:43:55.525 --> 00:43:56.445]  You're welcome to call in.
[00:43:56.525 --> 00:43:57.746]  I see it on Twitter.
[00:43:57.786 --> 00:43:58.566]  I see it on Facebook.
[00:43:58.586 --> 00:43:59.747]  Without even looking, I see it on YouTube.
[00:44:00.167 --> 00:44:02.088]  Oh, Alex Jones' show's all fake.
[00:44:02.508 --> 00:44:03.808]  His callers are fake.
[00:44:04.268 --> 00:44:05.529]  He reads off a teleprompter.
[00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:06.869]  They tell him what to do in his ear.
[00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.550]  Yeah, right.
[00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:15.793]  So, if you're one of those smart mouths, and you want to call in, and you disagree, you'll go to the head of the line, Buster.
[00:44:16.513 --> 00:44:19.334]  Just have a real point to make and a clear telephone, and you'll be on air.
[00:44:19.855 --> 00:44:20.595]  So, I'm calling your bluff.
[00:44:21.633 --> 00:44:22.814]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:44:22.834 --> 00:44:22.874]  877-789-2539.
[00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:24.536]  In fact, first-time callers, any subject you want.
[00:44:24.596 --> 00:44:26.719]  But, people that disagree, go to the head of the line.
[00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:26.779]  877-789-2539.
[00:44:27.159 --> 00:44:28.721]  I've had a lot of people ask me,
[00:44:41.806 --> 00:44:47.291]  What I think of the Revolver news story about Stuart Rhodes implying he's a federal operative or something.
[00:44:47.812 --> 00:44:49.654]  I've known Stuart 11 years or so.
[00:44:49.674 --> 00:44:51.135]  I think he's done a lot of great work.
[00:44:51.195 --> 00:44:52.556]  I like the mission of Oath Keepers.
[00:44:53.637 --> 00:45:02.966]  And he was even did a lot of work for Rob Due and won a case for Rob Due that was when Rob got tortured and beat up by the police covering an event in Pittsburgh.
[00:45:03.976 --> 00:45:08.660]  And the details of that, Rob never told me how much money he got, but it was a decent amount for what happened to him.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.902]  So, you know, Rhodes has been a lawyer, everything.
[00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:16.666]  I don't think that Stuart Rhodes is a fed.
[00:45:17.526 --> 00:45:24.652]  That said, though, when you get into anything that's got tens of thousands of members, you're going to have infiltrators in that organization.
[00:45:25.192 --> 00:45:28.375]  And then it becomes, well, don't say that, you're criticizing the organization.
[00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:33.286]  I mean, I've got a hundred and something crew members, and we've been infiltrated before.
[00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:34.532]  We've been infiltrated.
[00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:43.223]  And they just immediately start getting data, twisting things, lying about you going to the press, and luckily they always can reveal themselves pretty quick.
[00:45:44.004 --> 00:45:47.105]  But I think the first revolver story about the Feds provocateuring is excellent.
[00:45:47.485 --> 00:45:49.285]  I think the guy that wrote it means well.
[00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:59.789]  And I think it's important questions for, you know, Stewart to answer those questions and to really flesh that out as to why
[00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:04.890]  So many innocent oath keepers that didn't do anything are in jail, and then Stewart isn't.
[00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:06.351]  Well, they're calling him Person 1.
[00:46:06.411 --> 00:46:07.811]  They probably are going to end up arresting him.
[00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:10.232]  So, and I hope that that's not the case.
[00:46:10.272 --> 00:46:14.733]  So, I'm going to interview Stewart because I'm taping the Sunday show.
[00:46:15.213 --> 00:46:17.213]  Watch, there'll probably be a war or something, so I'll be in live.
[00:46:17.253 --> 00:46:20.054]  But 4th of July, Sunday, I'm going to take office 4th of July.
[00:46:20.454 --> 00:46:22.255]  I'm taping with Stewart today.
[00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:25.966]  And he'll have two segments, three, four, whatever he wants.
[00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:27.767]  Hell, if he wants the whole show, he can have it.
[00:46:28.687 --> 00:46:31.228]  You know, just to talk about the Capitol, January 6th.
[00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:34.430]  The whole thing is going to be about the revolver story, the second part.
[00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.292]  I talked to the revolver guy and I said, I'd like to see one about CNN and Antifa.
[00:46:40.452 --> 00:46:46.594]  And the Democrats wrote that big article in Time Magazine about how they basically tricked us at the Capitol and used mob psychology.
[00:46:46.614 --> 00:46:47.715]  And he said he is working on that.
[00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:49.836]  So I'm trying to get that guy on too.
[00:46:51.189 --> 00:46:55.474]  Quite frankly, what I'd like to do is see the two guys debate each other, because that's always interesting.
[00:46:55.514 --> 00:46:59.579]  But Stuart Rhodes is going to be interviewed by me today.
[00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:00.941]  Also, Judge Joe Brown.
[00:47:02.062 --> 00:47:03.984]  I'm going to be interviewing Judge Joe Brown today.
[00:47:05.012 --> 00:47:06.653]  And that would be such a powerful interview.
[00:47:06.673 --> 00:47:08.053]  I'm probably just going to put that out Saturday.
[00:47:08.073 --> 00:47:08.994]  It's its own broadcast.
[00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:11.374]  And then I might air some pieces of it.
[00:47:11.434 --> 00:47:12.715]  I think I might.
[00:47:13.215 --> 00:47:13.635]  I will.
[00:47:14.035 --> 00:47:14.916]  He's always a great guest.
[00:47:15.416 --> 00:47:19.998]  He'll be talking about everything that's going on, the race-based politics, Bill Cosby, all the rest of it.
[00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:21.198]  That is coming up, too.
[00:47:21.778 --> 00:47:23.939]  And so I'm interviewing Judge Brown.
[00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:25.780]  I'm going to be up here until 8 o'clock tonight.
[00:47:26.547 --> 00:47:27.668]  Doing a whole bunch of interviews.
[00:47:28.488 --> 00:47:30.809]  And I just thought, hey, why not just knock out a bunch of them?
[00:47:30.849 --> 00:47:34.391]  So I think I got five people I'm interviewing today.
[00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:36.272]  So look for that Saturday.
[00:47:36.893 --> 00:47:38.093]  Look for that on the Sunday show.
[00:47:38.113 --> 00:47:50.680]  In fact, I might just put out Rhodes and Judge Joe Brown and a bunch of others as maybe a commercial free three, four hour baby tomorrow on Saturday and then edit it down and air it on the Sunday show.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.140]  I don't know.
[00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:53.242]  But that's coming up.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.521]  And so much more.
[00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.342]  And then, of course, the Monday transmission.
[00:47:57.362 --> 00:48:01.905]  But right now, we're in the middle of this live, original, hold on, they're in my ear, tell me what to say!
[00:48:01.925 --> 00:48:02.746]  Yeah, right.
[00:48:03.607 --> 00:48:04.507]  Original broadcast.
[00:48:04.968 --> 00:48:05.868]  So, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[00:48:05.908 --> 00:48:09.591]  We're not supposed to be on air at this point.
[00:48:10.252 --> 00:48:13.274]  We're supposed to be off the air a long time ago.
[00:48:13.294 --> 00:48:18.658]  The Globals were supposed to have air superiority to carry out their race war and their bio-war on us.
[00:48:18.698 --> 00:48:21.540]  But humanity is awake and is fighting back.
[00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.073]  All right, Mike Adams is always on fire.
[00:48:25.134 --> 00:48:26.854]  He's particularly in fuego.
[00:48:27.714 --> 00:48:29.754]  What is the Latin for fire on fire?
[00:48:30.675 --> 00:48:34.375]  But he really just vacuum cleaners up all the key information.
[00:48:34.936 --> 00:48:36.836]  It's like half the time he's the guy that has it first.
[00:48:36.876 --> 00:48:41.457]  In this case, it was LifeSite News, but he went and did even more research on it and just blew me away.
[00:48:41.857 --> 00:48:45.258]  His article's at naturalnews.com and on infowars.com.
[00:48:46.318 --> 00:48:49.739]  And that's the New England Medical Journal finding that 82% of women that took
[00:48:51.636 --> 00:48:57.399]  The mRNA vaccines, Pfizer or Moderna, had miscarriages of their babies.
[00:48:57.519 --> 00:49:07.504]  That is just... I mean, I thought it was bombshell five weeks ago when they had testimony in Congress that half the CDC doctors and scientists won't take the COVID vaccines.
[00:49:09.104 --> 00:49:11.365]  But I mean, 82% miscarriages?
[00:49:11.906 --> 00:49:12.366]  Wow!
[00:49:13.747 --> 00:49:18.449]  And now they've got inserts saying it can make you have a heart attack, particularly young people.
[00:49:20.287 --> 00:49:32.773]  And I know people who've been in divorces, where some of the children live here, the others live there, and the father hears from the mother, oh, we're going to give our daughter the shot.
[00:49:34.053 --> 00:49:37.395]  And the father calls up and says, well, the children aren't even in danger of COVID.
[00:49:38.843 --> 00:49:41.145]  It's also experimental, and a lot of scientists say don't give it to children.
[00:49:41.165 --> 00:49:43.086]  In the UK, they don't give it to people under 16.
[00:49:43.966 --> 00:49:45.407]  It's like, I'm gonna do it!
[00:49:46.168 --> 00:49:54.072]  And it's all like a little mini form of human sacrifice, or Munchausen by proxy, to abuse their daughters and their sons like this.
[00:49:54.393 --> 00:50:01.077]  And I see the headlines and, you know, the, oh, the couples on CNN, oh, we're giving it to our six-month-old baby.
[00:50:01.877 --> 00:50:06.480]  It's not even approved for emergency authorization.
[00:50:07.754 --> 00:50:12.683]  It's so, and the scientists are like, mainline scientists are going, do not give it to your baby.
[00:50:12.924 --> 00:50:14.246]  No, no, please don't do that.
[00:50:14.988 --> 00:50:16.811]  We're doing it, we're liberal.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:25.406]  Oh, they don't want contact football, and oh, they don't want tag at school.
[00:50:25.446 --> 00:50:27.087]  That's been banned for a decade all over the country.
[00:50:27.668 --> 00:50:28.729]  Oh, they don't want dodgeball.
[00:50:28.749 --> 00:50:29.109]  That's mean.
[00:50:29.149 --> 00:50:30.991]  Oh, they don't want winners and losers.
[00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:33.774]  They don't, they want fuzzy math because you might hurt somebody's feelings.
[00:50:33.994 --> 00:50:37.978]  How about you might hurt somebody's brain giving them a deadly injection?
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.164]  So the whole pedophile New World Order ring system
[00:50:44.482 --> 00:51:01.453]  Was in so much trouble and it was all coming out and there were patriots in corporations and in government and all over that were fighting back and there's been a whole bunch of FBI agents busted by good FBI agents, you know, that are running pedophile rings and all the rest of it.
[00:51:01.854 --> 00:51:03.475]  So there's a real civil war inside the government.
[00:51:04.796 --> 00:51:08.278]  There's a civil war inside our churches, inside our families, inside our own minds.
[00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:19.075]  And so the globalists just launched their global lockdown and their hysteria to divert us away to just thinking about being able to go outside or have a job.
[00:51:20.235 --> 00:51:23.256]  Instead of talking about Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:27.437]  That's all their panicked response to what's happening.
[00:51:27.957 --> 00:51:33.519]  And the system is in absolute, complete panic right now and has struck back with all this.
[00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:36.659]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.082]  We have Osha in Canada, or Osh in Canada.
[00:51:42.122 --> 00:51:43.022]  We have Tyler in Maine.
[00:51:43.062 --> 00:51:44.063]  We have Kevin in Ohio.
[00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:45.023]  We have Victor in Florida.
[00:51:45.324 --> 00:51:46.764]  We have Charlie in FEMA Region 4.
[00:51:47.185 --> 00:51:48.546]  We have Brandon in Wisconsin.
[00:51:48.566 --> 00:51:49.586]  We have Matt in Florida.
[00:51:49.626 --> 00:51:50.807]  We have Scooter in Florida.
[00:51:51.187 --> 00:51:52.048]  We have Greg in Florida.
[00:51:52.388 --> 00:51:53.869]  You know, I started many years ago.
[00:51:55.174 --> 00:51:55.435]  I didn't
[00:52:14.693 --> 00:52:16.994]  Have callers call in and say what FEMA region they lived in.
[00:52:17.014 --> 00:52:23.679]  Because you know, under Biden's declared emergency and under the open borders and all this, America is under an emergency.
[00:52:23.719 --> 00:52:25.360]  We're under a FEMA emergency.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.941]  So you're really not in Texas.
[00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:28.702]  You're really not in Maine.
[00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:30.103]  You're really not in California.
[00:52:30.423 --> 00:52:31.844]  You're in your FEMA region.
[00:52:32.944 --> 00:52:41.810]  And so it's healthy to know what FEMA region you're in to start getting your mind wrapped around what's really going on.
[00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:48.608]  And it's under that emergency that they think they can get away with whatever they want.
[00:52:48.628 --> 00:52:50.088]  But just take a look at Jeffrey Epstein right here.
[00:52:51.449 --> 00:52:59.090]  Jeffrey Epstein's 8,000-acre Zorro Ranch in New Mexico is listed for $27.5 million.
[00:53:01.051 --> 00:53:07.712]  And he was basically given the property by the state of New Mexico, see, because he's a government officer carrying out a cloning operation at that base.
[00:53:10.384 --> 00:53:11.205]  There's a new video out.
[00:53:11.225 --> 00:53:11.985]  We'll play her in a moment.
[00:53:12.306 --> 00:53:16.189]  Reporter confuses Bill Clinton as Bill Cosby in hilarious Freudian slip.
[00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:24.356]  And I'm going to give you my view with Judge Joe Brown interview that I'm doing today on that little air again this weekend of what I think about Cosby.
[00:53:24.897 --> 00:53:25.537]  But I'll say this.
[00:53:25.717 --> 00:53:28.139]  I'm glad that Bill Cosby has been released from prison.
[00:53:31.002 --> 00:53:32.643]  Not because I'm a fan of Hollywood.
[00:53:32.764 --> 00:53:35.166]  Not because I don't think Cosby didn't do some weird stuff.
[00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:46.888]  But because they did violate his rights, and they did lie in a prosecution agreement, and the tyranny of corrupt prosecutors is more dangerous than Bill Cosby.
[00:53:47.348 --> 00:53:47.788]  It's simple.
[00:53:48.008 --> 00:53:52.012]  You ever heard the saying, better ten guilty men go free than one innocent man go to prison?
[00:53:53.854 --> 00:53:56.975]  The majority of those women did it for money in a shakedown.
[00:53:57.395 --> 00:54:00.317]  Cosby admitted, yeah, I've given women pills when they asked for it before.
[00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:03.938]  He'd done an agreement to tell the truth, he did it, they threw his ass in jail.
[00:54:04.238 --> 00:54:05.339]  Was he screwing little kids?
[00:54:05.639 --> 00:54:05.819]  No.
[00:54:06.699 --> 00:54:13.042]  He had topless dancers who'd worked for decades in the industry up in hotel party rooms with a bunch of men.
[00:54:13.942 --> 00:54:15.123]  And people coming to his house.
[00:54:15.183 --> 00:54:16.904]  And I'm not saying it isn't creepy.
[00:54:17.104 --> 00:54:18.784]  And I'm not giving women quaaludes.
[00:54:19.044 --> 00:54:20.005]  And I don't like it.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.882]  I'm just saying, to sit there and then violate his rights is violating my rights.
[00:54:28.003 --> 00:54:30.464]  And a lot of it is, Bill Cosby didn't go along with Oprah Winfrey.
[00:54:30.484 --> 00:54:32.525]  He didn't go along with the whole Black Lives Matter thing.
[00:54:32.565 --> 00:54:35.326]  He didn't go along with the whole tear down the fathers thing.
[00:54:35.667 --> 00:54:37.427]  And so they said, hell, we got something on him.
[00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:40.949]  We've had the FBI watching him for 30 years, 40 years.
[00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:41.709]  He likes women.
[00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.831]  He's probably had sex with a thousand women.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.822]  So to King David, what are we going to do?
[00:54:48.842 --> 00:54:50.383]  I guess that was Solomon, his son did that.
[00:54:51.044 --> 00:54:52.025]  What are we going to do?
[00:54:52.465 --> 00:54:54.507]  He without sin cast the first stone is all I'm saying.
[00:54:54.827 --> 00:55:03.895]  So Bill Cosby had given a fair trial and the jury found him guilty of giving a woman a pill.
[00:55:07.332 --> 00:55:08.513]  Then I say, put him in jail.
[00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:14.336]  But they violated his rights, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed with that, and that's the right thing to do.
[00:55:15.036 --> 00:55:18.098]  Because if you violate somebody's rights, you violate everybody's rights.
[00:55:18.398 --> 00:55:34.567]  But now, I'm spied on, Tucker Carlson's spied on, the left says all sex between a man and a woman's rape, but you can have convicted pedophiles at Drag Queen Storytime with your child bouncing on their knee, and in many cases they don't even tell the parents they're coming to the schools to do it.
[00:55:37.955 --> 00:55:43.038]  So, how many Disney directors have been convicted of pedophiles they let direct movies with children and they rape them?
[00:55:43.358 --> 00:55:47.000]  I say execute pedophiles that are multiple time offenders.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:57.767]  And so, it's like in Scarface where he gets up, he's at the restaurant, all the rich people, and he goes, oh yeah, you need me to point your finger and say there's the bad man.
[00:55:58.067 --> 00:56:00.028]  So here, point at me, there's the bad man.
[00:56:00.348 --> 00:56:01.529]  It's the same thing with Bill Cosby.
[00:56:03.677 --> 00:56:06.358]  But everybody got on the whole Me Too bandwagon.
[00:56:07.118 --> 00:56:10.659]  Oh, Bill Cosby, he's the worst devil the world ever saw!
[00:56:10.679 --> 00:56:17.501]  And then they sent his ass to prison after they violated a prosecution agreement.
[00:56:17.961 --> 00:56:26.564]  You can't tell somebody, agree to this, agree to that, pay these people money, and then we're not going to prosecute you.
[00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:29.665]  We're not going to let these other women testify because they're from 25, 30 years ago.
[00:56:34.674 --> 00:56:36.515]  And then go back on that.
[00:56:36.775 --> 00:56:38.016]  You can't do that!
[00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:43.178]  The rule of law, the whole country's based on a deal's a deal.
[00:56:45.039 --> 00:56:46.780]  We don't see that from today's FBI, do we?
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.601]  Or the federal government, or state governments.
[00:56:48.621 --> 00:56:53.783]  They're out of control, they're breaking all the rules, not getting that that's going to turn around and burn them in the end.
[00:56:55.784 --> 00:56:58.826]  So, I think Bill Cosby is an old pervert.
[00:56:59.912 --> 00:57:03.697]  And I think Bill Cosby, we know, these women wanted money from him.
[00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:05.019]  They've been coming around for years.
[00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:07.021]  He'd finally get sick of it and drug them.
[00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:07.742]  I think that's wrong.
[00:57:08.163 --> 00:57:10.786]  We are back, broadcasting worldwide on this Friday Transmission.
[00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:17.715]  Got a big weekend for you coming up with Judge Joe Brown, special broadcast, Stuart Rhodes, and a bunch of other big guests.
[00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:23.517]  Keep watching InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, BannedOutVideo.
[00:57:23.557 --> 00:57:24.538]  That's how we get the truth.
[00:57:24.558 --> 00:57:25.398]  That's how we win.
[00:57:25.738 --> 00:57:27.038]  Full spectrum resistance.
[00:57:27.779 --> 00:57:29.559]  Okay, I said call in if you disagree.
[00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:38.422]  I just throw that out there because, you know, I see people attacking me online and, you know, saying, oh, Jones has fake callers and, you know, all the rest of this stuff.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.281]  And so I always like to get the calls that disagree.
[00:57:41.301 --> 00:57:46.423]  In fact, sometimes we just take calls that do disagree so we can actually get a view into what's happening.
[00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.704]  A lot of times folks are sarcastic, though.
[00:57:48.724 --> 00:57:49.565]  They don't really disagree.
[00:57:49.985 --> 00:57:53.807]  They just do that to, I guess, get in ahead of the line.
[00:57:54.447 --> 00:57:56.908]  But we've got Justin in Florida says he disagrees.
[00:57:56.948 --> 00:57:58.149]  We've got Mark in Pennsylvania.
[00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:59.589]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:57:59.610 --> 00:57:59.950]  Love you, man.
[00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:00.430]  Love the show.
[00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:02.071]  I especially love
[00:58:26.837 --> 00:58:29.880]  It's a very complicated dichotomy which is the New World Order that we all face and the thing that I realized that
[00:58:50.538 --> 00:59:07.603]  I understand, you know, you gotta be real careful the line you walk, and I'm not sure whether you're doing it to avoid ridicule or because you're afraid of the programming that the public is currently under from the mainstream media.
[00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:12.765]  But, you know, you're the most prolific dot connector I've ever heard in my entire life.
[00:59:13.225 --> 00:59:19.107]  But there's one dot that you just never seem to connect or seem to avoid it at all costs.
[00:59:20.032 --> 00:59:21.513]  It's the Zionist dot.
[00:59:21.713 --> 00:59:23.795]  I mean, you know, it's Christ that's said in the Bible.
[00:59:23.835 --> 00:59:24.695]  Synagogue of Satan.
[00:59:24.716 --> 00:59:26.837]  You know, it's the Kabbalists, which are the New World Order.
[00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:29.079]  That is the one thing that binds them all.
[00:59:29.159 --> 00:59:31.180]  And, you know, keep in mind, I'm Jewish by blood.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.001]  My family was a rich family of Jews.
[00:59:33.022 --> 00:59:35.844]  The Americans founded the city of Medellin.
[00:59:35.864 --> 00:59:41.808]  My family name is located right in between Rothschild and Rockefeller on the list of top 50 families that run the world.
[00:59:42.375 --> 00:59:54.522]  But, you know, despite that, I still cannot get over the fact that every single one of them, whether you're talking about George Soros, whether you're talking about Rockefeller, Rothschild, Bill Gates, they're all Kabbalist Jewish.
[00:59:54.562 --> 00:59:57.444]  Now, I don't know what Kabbalist means in comparison.
[00:59:57.484 --> 00:59:59.525]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you this.
[00:59:59.745 --> 01:00:02.927]  I try to not make things about what religion people are.
[01:00:04.016 --> 01:00:07.037]  And certainly there are a lot of powerful Jews in powerful positions around the world.
[01:00:07.077 --> 01:00:07.737]  Nobody doubts that.
[01:00:07.757 --> 01:00:10.078]  I see China as a big dominant force.
[01:00:10.098 --> 01:00:14.659]  I remember talking about China buying up four of the big six Hollywood production companies ten years ago.
[01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:15.819]  People didn't know that it happened.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.201]  They're like, oh, Jones is covering up for the Jews saying China bought up Hollywood.
[01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.241]  I mean, China did.
[01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.102]  And so I try to stay out of
[01:00:25.506 --> 01:00:26.707]  You know, saying Catholics are bad.
[01:00:26.767 --> 01:00:27.528]  Catholics aren't bad.
[01:00:27.548 --> 01:00:28.608]  A lot of Catholics are good people.
[01:00:28.909 --> 01:00:30.030]  The Pope is very evil.
[01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:30.690]  He's very bad.
[01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:32.692]  I attacked the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:00:32.752 --> 01:00:34.033]  You know, it's a big leftist group.
[01:00:34.093 --> 01:00:35.013]  I attacked the ADL.
[01:00:35.334 --> 01:00:36.294]  They're anti-free speech.
[01:00:36.314 --> 01:00:37.255]  They're very un-American.
[01:00:38.016 --> 01:00:40.277]  Mark Zuckerberg's become anti-free speech, un-American.
[01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:41.959]  I don't attack him because he's a Jew.
[01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:44.541]  I attack him because he's become an authoritarian.
[01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:49.304]  Uh, and so I have callers on like you that want to, you know, talk about Jews.
[01:00:49.424 --> 01:00:53.306]  I mean, that's a, that's a real thing that people really enjoy talking about.
[01:00:53.786 --> 01:00:55.347]  It's something they really like to get into.
[01:00:55.367 --> 01:00:59.870]  Um, and you know, I, I see the news saying white people are inherently bad.
[01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.871]  That's a big hot thing.
[01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:05.314]  You know, being pushed by the left and by a lot of Jewish organizations.
[01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:08.356]  And last time I checked, I thought Jews looked pretty white to me.
[01:01:09.077 --> 01:01:16.022]  And it's what I think is there's a racial fetish by elites to play groups off against each other according to religion or race.
[01:01:16.523 --> 01:01:18.784]  And that's used as a divide and conquer mechanism.
[01:01:18.824 --> 01:01:24.729]  So I try not to wade into that so that when I'm being called anti-Semitic,
[01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:26.836]  Or racist.
[01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:31.421]  People have a problem saying I've done that because I haven't.
[01:01:31.661 --> 01:01:34.424]  I'm just opposing the fruits of the New World Order.
[01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:39.529]  I'm opposing the global government takeover, trying to have a big tent for everybody here.
[01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.392]  And like you said, you say you're of Jewish derivation.
[01:01:42.713 --> 01:01:44.755]  I know a lot of Jews that are really nice, smart people.
[01:01:45.716 --> 01:01:48.059]  I also know there are Jewish organizations that persecute me.
[01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:50.240]  And, you know, they do that.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:02:01.505]  But I'm not going to get down on their level and be racially based or religious based like that and, you know, persecute me just because I'm a WASP and I guess somebody was mean to their great-great-granddaddy or something.
[01:02:02.365 --> 01:02:03.065]  I didn't do that.
[01:02:03.185 --> 01:02:06.987]  So I'm not going to kind of like be Red Skull and they can be Captain America.
[01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:13.550]  In that scripting, in that narrative, I'm not agreeing to play the part of opposition.
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.771]  I mean, you know, some of the Jewish groups are famous for
[01:02:16.823 --> 01:02:22.281]  Bombing their own people in Spain after World War II and in Iraq to make a move to Israel.
[01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:25.175]  You know, that's not very nice.
[01:02:25.235 --> 01:02:31.576]  So there's a lot of persecution of Jews by Jews that want to manage and control Jews, but that's not all Jews.
[01:02:31.996 --> 01:02:38.758]  You know, there were a lot of Jews that radiated tens of thousands of little Jewish children because they were Sephardic, not Ashkenazi.
[01:02:38.778 --> 01:02:39.939]  That's the ringworm children.
[01:02:40.279 --> 01:02:43.340]  You know, that's not nice to radiate Jews, in some cases, to death.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.341]  But again, all these countries are radiating their people and doing eugenics because there's an evil force up above it.
[01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:51.542]  Whether you live in Israel or whether you live in the U.S.,
[01:02:52.122 --> 01:02:53.944]  They're trying to make us take deadly poison.
[01:02:53.964 --> 01:03:01.453]  Whether you live in, you know, Chile or whether you live in Germany, it's the same global corporate governance that's doing it.
[01:03:02.434 --> 01:03:04.176]  And so, that's where I stand.
[01:03:04.196 --> 01:03:07.480]  You were able to call in and bring up the whole Jewish issue.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.260]  Justin, anything else?
[01:03:09.322 --> 01:03:09.522]  Yes.
[01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:13.046]  One connection that people need to understand is that
[01:03:13.607 --> 01:03:16.391]  Communism would not exist without Judaism.
[01:03:16.511 --> 01:03:18.734]  All the original Bolsheviks, they were all Jewish.
[01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:22.299]  Karl Marx, Stalin, Lenin, they're all Judaism.
[01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:26.364]  If you read that letter from Buchslevi to Karl Marx, it says right there what's the plan of communism.
[01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:29.708]  These Jewish people that are pushing communism, they don't believe in communism.
[01:03:29.728 --> 01:03:30.730]  They're not communists.
[01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.371]  You understand that the whole anti-Jew group says I'm Jewish, right?
[01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:34.272]  I mean, you know that, right?
[01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:34.992]  And I'm not.
[01:03:35.172 --> 01:03:36.393]  If I was, I'd be proud of it.
[01:03:36.473 --> 01:03:37.174]  You understand that, right?
[01:03:58.497 --> 01:04:01.358]  You understand that Bill Gates is not Jewish.
[01:04:02.998 --> 01:04:06.820]  The last time I checked, the Rockefellers were like Presbyterian.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.961]  Are there a lot of powerful Jews in positions of power like Henry Kissinger?
[01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:11.421]  Damn right.
[01:04:12.241 --> 01:04:15.062]  Did his lieutenant, Rothkopf, try to hire me?
[01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:16.622]  Yeah.
[01:04:16.923 --> 01:04:18.503]  Okay, so yeah.
[01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:21.884]  That's no secret that Jews excel at academia and government and all that and are all over the place.
[01:04:22.944 --> 01:04:24.805]  My issue here with that is
[01:04:26.192 --> 01:04:29.293]  This idea that if you slip and fall in a banana pill, a Jew did it.
[01:04:30.073 --> 01:04:33.493]  Or, oh, Jones is successful, the Jews are backing him.
[01:04:33.774 --> 01:04:37.914]  No, my listeners are backing me, and my show is backing us.
[01:04:38.534 --> 01:04:44.276]  So I resent the magic carpet aspect of claiming everybody's a Jew.
[01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:52.817]  Because you were just listing a bunch of people that this person's a Jew, and that person's a Jew, and Jew this, Jew that, and, you know, just the bizarreness.
[01:04:52.897 --> 01:04:55.778]  And I'm not saying you're doing this, but I've experienced this.
[01:04:57.944 --> 01:05:00.225]  We're gonna go to break and come back.
[01:05:00.685 --> 01:05:03.886]  I cover issues, I cover policies that I'm for.
[01:05:04.686 --> 01:05:09.588]  And it doesn't matter whether you're Jewish or German or Chinese, if you agree with those issues, we agree with each other.
[01:05:09.848 --> 01:05:11.828]  And I think I'm promoting policies that help humanity.
[01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:12.809]  I'm pro-human.
[01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:15.490]  And I try to stay out of the race-based stuff.
[01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:16.470]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:23.292]  Okay, we can't spend nine minutes with the next caller, or we won't get to all these great people.
[01:05:23.332 --> 01:05:25.893]  But we're talking to folks that disagree, the first that got in
[01:05:26.912 --> 01:05:34.995]  So it's Will disagrees in California, and they're calling in about just wild stuff.
[01:05:35.075 --> 01:05:36.535]  Jesus is not the Messiah.
[01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:39.837]  And you know, that's why I don't do a lot of these disagree calls.
[01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:43.918]  I mean, you can always call and disagree, but when I do call for it, I guess I'd forgotten.
[01:05:44.018 --> 01:05:51.301]  It just goes off in the left field, which is fine, but that just gets a little confusing, but okay.
[01:05:52.141 --> 01:05:52.941]  Will, go ahead.
[01:05:53.221 --> 01:05:54.262]  Jesus is not the Messiah.
[01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:54.882]  Tell me about this.
[01:05:56.052 --> 01:06:01.956]  Hi Alex, a huge fan obviously, and I did an animation of Bill Gates and you guys played it, so I appreciate that.
[01:06:02.656 --> 01:06:04.637]  Oh, where he's wearing the pink sweater?
[01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:07.359]  Yeah, the pink sweater and you shoot him in the head.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.741]  I got a strike for that on YouTube.
[01:06:10.561 --> 01:06:10.982]  But anyhow.
[01:06:11.142 --> 01:06:13.423]  Yeah, that went a little too far.
[01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.364]  I don't want to turn him into a martyr.
[01:06:16.265 --> 01:06:17.005]  For sure, absolutely.
[01:06:17.226 --> 01:06:17.846]  I totally understand.
[01:06:19.247 --> 01:06:21.909]  But yeah, so my point is, I'll make it quick.
[01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:25.651]  I've been listening to this guy, Rabbi Tovia Stinger.
[01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:33.231]  And he's, you know, exposing the Christian Church and how Jesus is basically used for money to control people.
[01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:41.920]  And he was only a rabbi, and there's countless times in the Bible where he's saying, why are you praising me?
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.482]  There's only one, and that's the Father.
[01:06:43.922 --> 01:06:45.564]  So, I mean, that's the only point I wanted to make, man.
[01:06:45.624 --> 01:06:47.466]  I love what you're doing, and we just need to unite.
[01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:50.130]  On the one true God?
[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.472]  There's no Trinity, there's no Buddha, there's no any of this other stuff.
[01:06:53.532 --> 01:06:54.532]  It's only one true God.
[01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:56.393]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:06:57.193 --> 01:07:01.014]  So you can see everybody's got axes to grind and it always revolves around Judaism.
[01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:05.856]  So this is all, a rabbi says Jesus isn't the Messiah, the other guy, the Jews are bad.
[01:07:05.876 --> 01:07:07.937]  I mean, it's just, it just gives me a headache.
[01:07:08.237 --> 01:07:09.057]  But hey, that's fine.
[01:07:09.077 --> 01:07:10.898]  We're opening the phones up to see what people disagree about.
[01:07:11.826 --> 01:07:12.947]  All these fake callers.
[01:07:12.967 --> 01:07:14.888]  The internet says, oh Jones has fake callers.
[01:07:15.288 --> 01:07:16.368]  Call in sometimes folks.
[01:07:16.448 --> 01:07:17.249]  It's not the case.
[01:07:18.189 --> 01:07:19.570]  We're so real it's ridiculous.
[01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:23.092]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Pennsylvania who disagrees.
[01:07:23.132 --> 01:07:23.552]  Go ahead.
[01:07:24.893 --> 01:07:26.093]  Good afternoon Alex.
[01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.514]  I'll get right to the point.
[01:07:28.314 --> 01:07:29.395]  Trump is a globalist.
[01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:30.515]  He's a traitor.
[01:07:30.976 --> 01:07:33.717]  He sold us out and shame on you for supporting him.
[01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:35.676]  I'll make my case as to why.
[01:07:35.736 --> 01:07:38.457]  Number one, he did nothing about big tech censorship.
[01:07:38.497 --> 01:07:41.517]  Number two, he's done nothing about George Soros.
[01:07:41.597 --> 01:07:45.518]  Number three, he did nothing to stop the riots last year.
[01:07:45.758 --> 01:07:48.779]  Number four, he appointed all swamp creatures.
[01:07:48.839 --> 01:07:56.500]  And number five, it was Trump who pushed through these vaccines and Operation Warp Speed.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.601]  It's thanks to Trump we have this genetic code injection.
[01:08:00.094 --> 01:08:02.978]  Now if I can have some time, I can develop those points.
[01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:08.605]  And you never, you always gloss over the fact that he gave us Operation Warp Speed in the VAX.
[01:08:09.226 --> 01:08:10.167]  Well, that's not true.
[01:08:10.207 --> 01:08:13.509]  I've been extremely critical of Trump with Operation Warp Speed.
[01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:15.291]  You must not listen very often.
[01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:21.736]  I listen when I can, but you say he was talked into it and stuff.
[01:08:21.776 --> 01:08:22.977]  He was misled.
[01:08:23.377 --> 01:08:25.419]  I listen enough.
[01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:29.883]  I'm not into lesser of two evils, and I agree with you, Trump has been disappointing in many ways.
[01:08:30.803 --> 01:08:32.764]  Do you not want him to get good Republicans elected?
[01:08:32.784 --> 01:08:35.005]  Because he's getting a lot of really good Republicans elected.
[01:08:35.025 --> 01:08:57.858]  Well, I damn sure don't want Democrats elected, but, you know, because we know what they'll do, but, you know, he could have done something about the big tech censorship, you know, because, you know, they had those hearings in the fall of 2018, by the time, you know, and you and Laura Loomer had been banned already, and all the big tech... Well, Mark, I gotta say, you must not be listening to the show
[01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.379]  No, I listen to the show, Alex!
[01:09:00.659 --> 01:09:14.463]  Okay, well I've been extremely critical the entire time of these mRNA vaccines, and I was hoping that Trump was just trying to say, oh, warp speed to reopen the economy, which he was, and then later would criticize the vaccines, which he hasn't done.
[01:09:15.103 --> 01:09:17.564]  So I was trying to play devil's advocate to figure out what the hell he was doing.
[01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:24.306]  I have said for over a year that I'm very upset with what Trump's done, pushing that, probably almost every show.
[01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:26.207]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:09:26.807 --> 01:09:29.029]  Okay, we got a lot of other callers here.
[01:09:29.049 --> 01:09:32.652]  I want to go to them in the order that they are received.
[01:09:33.653 --> 01:09:36.796]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida.
[01:09:36.816 --> 01:09:37.656]  Matt, thanks for calling.
[01:09:38.937 --> 01:09:40.519]  Alex, it's great to talk to you, man.
[01:09:40.559 --> 01:09:41.900]  I'm going to get right to it, dude.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.061]  I know you're a humble guy.
[01:09:43.081 --> 01:09:54.971]  You don't like when people call in and tell you thank you and that you're doing a great job and everything, but I want to tell you thank you because I've got a son that's in the Marine Corps and he's being screwed with quite a bit about this vaccine thing.
[01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:57.260]  Most of the people where he's at have taken it.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:05.943]  He's refused to take it after I've shown him the videos that you've made, after the 10 penny videos and all the interviews and all the research.
[01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:07.844]  The boy called me this morning.
[01:10:07.884 --> 01:10:08.224]  He said,
[01:10:09.013 --> 01:10:24.787]  Dad, I asked him, I tried to kind of go easy with it because I remember being a young kid about his age in the Navy and, you know, you want to go out, you want to have a good time, you want to have a beer, you want to do this, you want to do that, and they're all being told no.
[01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:27.910]  The ones that are not bowing down to this.
[01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:30.912]  And I asked him today, I said, son, have you taken the shot?
[01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:31.333]  He said,
[01:10:31.903 --> 01:10:33.644]  I'm not taking that shot no matter what.
[01:10:34.325 --> 01:10:35.686]  I don't care what happens.
[01:10:35.726 --> 01:10:36.967]  Well, brother, don't thank me.
[01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:38.708]  It's going to be my children.
[01:10:38.808 --> 01:10:41.810]  My son's 18, my daughter's 17, 13 and 4.
[01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.911]  Our children go together into the future.
[01:10:43.931 --> 01:10:44.812]  We're one family.
[01:10:45.432 --> 01:10:50.135]  And what's beautiful is you raised a son that's strong and you took the time to spread the word.
[01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:54.819]  So I admire you and I commend you because there's no doubt this is reducing fertility.
[01:10:55.814 --> 01:10:57.475]  There's no doubt it's attacking the brain and the heart.
[01:10:58.195 --> 01:11:00.276]  And so it's the most important thing your son's ever done.
[01:11:00.597 --> 01:11:06.420]  And shame on the military and the leadership bullying our armed services to take an experimental shot.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:16.145]  And we should be up in arms protesting Congress and really upset and letting those commanders know they're going to be held responsible for anybody that gets sick from these deadly injections.
[01:11:16.385 --> 01:11:21.768]  I got articles right here about troops having heart attacks and being hospitalized and dying from these injections.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:30.708]  I've been thinking about it quite a bit and I wonder, I've wondered are they giving them saline or are they giving them the real deal or whatever?
[01:11:31.048 --> 01:11:41.020]  But if you wanted to collapse America and you want to collapse the free world and you want hell on this earth, first thing it needs to go down is the United States military and if everybody's running around
[01:11:42.483 --> 01:11:47.047]  23 years old with Alzheimer's and neurological disorders and all the rest of it.
[01:11:47.427 --> 01:11:49.508]  Well, there goes your military and they're good.
[01:11:49.528 --> 01:11:50.789]  It's a soft kill weapon.
[01:11:50.809 --> 01:11:55.413]  They already tested it with the anthrax shot in the Gulf War that killed over 40,000 US troops.
[01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:56.413]  Congressional studies.
[01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:57.534]  Beautifully said.
[01:11:57.574 --> 01:11:58.335]  God bless you, Matt.
[01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:02.817]  I'm almost ashamed I went to those callers that disagreed and wasted time.
[01:12:02.837 --> 01:12:03.918]  We have all these other great callers.
[01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:08.542]  You know, the last caller had legitimate points, okay?
[01:12:09.522 --> 01:12:10.583]  You know, the caller that disagreed.
[01:12:11.584 --> 01:12:18.549]  It's just, Trump's getting really hardcore Republicans elected and they don't want Trump doing that.
[01:12:18.569 --> 01:12:20.191]  They're trying to indict him right now.
[01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:22.733]  So I just, Trump's not perfect.
[01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:26.996]  And so he's gone now.
[01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.438]  So let's talk about Joe Biden.
[01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:33.903]  It's that simple.
[01:12:33.963 --> 01:12:41.467]  I know people that are personal friends of mine that got so mad at me, still supporting Trump, because I knew they were about to steal the election from him.
[01:12:42.007 --> 01:12:42.987]  And they didn't want him there.
[01:12:43.107 --> 01:12:46.849]  Well, they got what they want now, so let's just move on from the Trump bashing.
[01:12:46.869 --> 01:12:47.670]  Okay?
[01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:51.091]  Let's just... You're welcome to call in and bash if you want.
[01:12:51.171 --> 01:12:55.133]  I'm saying we should move on from it and know that he meant well and did a lot of good things.
[01:12:55.593 --> 01:12:56.974]  Had some problems, none of them were so perfect.
[01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:01.856]  But... You got Joe Biden now.
[01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:05.763]  And I don't seem to hear those callers that are mad at Trump mad at Joe Biden.
[01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.565]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:14.688]  That would be Charlie in FEMA Region 5.
[01:13:14.768 --> 01:13:15.488]  Welcome, Charlie.
[01:13:16.869 --> 01:13:17.209]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.450]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.650]  How are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.591]  I'm good, brother.
[01:13:19.631 --> 01:13:19.951]  Go ahead.
[01:13:19.971 --> 01:13:21.272]  All right.
[01:13:21.312 --> 01:13:26.595]  Well, first of all, I got to agree with, you know, a little bit of what the last caller was talking about, you know, with Trump.
[01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:28.360]  You know, he did a lot more good.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:28.820]  I agree.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.701]  You know, you're 100% spot on.
[01:13:29.861 --> 01:13:34.906]  He did a lot more good than he did bad, but he's still advocating for the vaccine, brother.
[01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:41.091]  Like, when I see him, like, talking about it, you know, saying our great vaccine and this and that, and I'm like, what?
[01:13:41.271 --> 01:13:41.512]  Why?
[01:13:41.592 --> 01:13:41.832]  Why?
[01:13:41.952 --> 01:13:49.358]  I mean, if this guy is really that hardcore, supposedly, you know, the guy that's going to save us, I mean, you should not be doing it.
[01:13:49.378 --> 01:13:53.342]  You should be really going after Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, you know, and just
[01:13:53.737 --> 01:13:56.400]  Giving them the business, just, I know what you're doing.
[01:14:10.294 --> 01:14:11.977]  Uh, and I know the inside baseball of Trump.
[01:14:12.017 --> 01:14:12.918]  He's 75.
[01:14:13.399 --> 01:14:14.260]  He's overwhelmed.
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.144]  He's a smart guy in many ways, but not in others.
[01:14:17.584 --> 01:14:22.171]  And once he signs on to something, he's pigheaded about it, saying, I'm the one that got the vaccine.
[01:14:22.251 --> 01:14:22.932]  I'm the good guy.
[01:14:23.232 --> 01:14:24.894]  And now that it's coming out, that it's hurting people.
[01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:26.896]  He's too pig-headed to come out and say it.
[01:14:27.136 --> 01:14:30.877]  He is talking about Ashley Babbitt now, and saying they may have staged January 6th.
[01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:31.978]  That's more like it!
[01:14:32.038 --> 01:14:33.339]  Get on the offense, Trump!
[01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:34.359]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:40.422]  Alright, Greg Reese is a great contributor here to the Alex Jones Show, and he's always proud of his work.
[01:14:40.462 --> 01:14:42.323]  He's got, on average, the most popular
[01:14:43.226 --> 01:14:44.006]  I don't know.
[01:15:05.359 --> 01:15:10.104]  He's done a new report that he's extremely proud of, and that is extremely powerful.
[01:15:10.624 --> 01:15:14.428]  It's the 10 stages of genocide, and everyone needs to see it.
[01:15:15.129 --> 01:15:18.832]  Patriots who stand against the Great Reset being targeted for genocide.
[01:15:18.872 --> 01:15:21.214]  He's connected a lot of the dots here.
[01:15:21.335 --> 01:15:26.580]  Mike Adams is going to be joining us in the next hour to cover the waterfront on this, so stay with us.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.642]  I'm about to go back to Charlie.
[01:15:29.813 --> 01:15:34.675]  We'll continue with your calls into the next segment and then Mike Adams comes on after that.
[01:15:34.855 --> 01:15:44.080]  But separately, I called over to my warehouse manager and I said, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is back in stock?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.401]  DNA Force Plus is back in stock?
[01:15:47.682 --> 01:15:48.822]  How are we offering these at 40% off?
[01:15:48.862 --> 01:15:49.302]  And he said, no.
[01:15:50.902 --> 01:15:54.585]  We're, we've had it at regular price and it's about to sell out, won't have more for months.
[01:15:55.345 --> 01:15:57.967]  You said sell everything at sales price to get funding in.
[01:15:58.488 --> 01:16:04.533]  So, everything is 40 to 60% off, double pay 3 points, free shipping, biggest sell of the year so far.
[01:16:04.933 --> 01:16:07.135]  It's gotta end Monday morning, he was telling me.
[01:16:07.155 --> 01:16:08.756]  A lot of this will be ended before then.
[01:16:09.116 --> 01:16:10.456]  Turbo Force, 40% off.
[01:16:10.596 --> 01:16:11.717]  Alpha Power, 40% off.
[01:16:12.117 --> 01:16:13.317]  Vazlo Beach, 40% off.
[01:16:13.377 --> 01:16:14.017]  Poma Block, 40% off.
[01:16:14.077 --> 01:16:14.497]  X2, 50% off.
[01:16:14.977 --> 01:16:18.358]  Supermobile Vitality, 50% off.
[01:16:18.378 --> 01:16:21.938]  Super Survival Shield X3, 60% off.
[01:16:22.319 --> 01:16:23.799]  BioTruth Selenium, 50% off.
[01:16:24.139 --> 01:16:25.479]  Ultimate Crayola, 40% off.
[01:16:25.599 --> 01:16:28.000]  All water filtration systems, 10% off.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.280]  All swearable food, huge deal, 10% off.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.861]  All exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.881]  And I'll tell you, X
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.562]  Three is tri-ionine, deep-earth crystal ionine, and two other types for better absorption.
[01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:43.523]  It's apples and oranges with X2.
[01:16:44.143 --> 01:16:48.485]  It's going to sell out by Tuesday at current sales, because it's $16 a bottle.
[01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:49.986]  That's almost a loss leader with free shipping.
[01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.067]  That is going to end.
[01:16:52.547 --> 01:16:54.668]  I may even end it tomorrow, because it's selling so fast.
[01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:59.290]  We need a little bit, you know, at full price to even fund our operation, because more won't come in for at least 8 to 12 weeks.
[01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.211]  X2 is selling very, very quickly.
[01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:04.332]  I'm going to keep it on sale through next Wednesday.
[01:17:04.392 --> 01:17:05.173]  It's 50% off.
[01:17:05.693 --> 01:17:06.754]  Try each formula.
[01:17:06.774 --> 01:17:07.534]  See what you like better.
[01:17:07.554 --> 01:17:09.515]  It takes a couple weeks to kick in for the average person.
[01:17:10.276 --> 01:17:15.739]  And you kind of go through a detox at the end of week two, and then it's wild in most people's experiences.
[01:17:15.779 --> 01:17:20.141]  But it's what so many people are deficient in.
[01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:21.702]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:17:21.962 --> 01:17:22.803]  How is the good halogen?
[01:17:22.823 --> 01:17:24.044]  Get your X2, your X3.
[01:17:24.904 --> 01:17:26.065]  Don't have much time to get them.
[01:17:27.728 --> 01:17:31.231]  at infowarrestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:38.297]  And while you're there, please get a free American t-shirt with the big American flag on the front and camo in navy blue and in black.
[01:17:38.617 --> 01:17:39.838]  For men and women, it's unisex.
[01:17:39.858 --> 01:17:42.340]  We also have the Save the Frog shirts that are really popular.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.802]  That helps spread the word and it keeps us on air.
[01:17:45.162 --> 01:17:46.764]  That's how we get it done.
[01:17:46.804 --> 01:17:48.125]  I want to go to this Gregory's report.
[01:17:48.565 --> 01:17:55.871]  It's so important, but Charlie in FEMA Region 6, please get your original point of vaccines and spiritual warfare.
[01:17:55.891 --> 01:17:56.612]  Tell me what you're thinking.
[01:17:57.688 --> 01:18:04.894]  Alright, well, first, you know, we're talking about the vaccine, so basically, like, it's definitely the mark of the beast.
[01:18:05.054 --> 01:18:10.899]  I think definitely it's the mark of the beast, or at least the microchip, you know, that Klaus Schwab was always talking about.
[01:18:10.939 --> 01:18:14.002]  It's the genetic takeover of our body that God made reprogramming us.
[01:18:14.062 --> 01:18:15.643]  It definitely is a satanic takeover.
[01:18:16.704 --> 01:18:16.965]  It is, 100%.
[01:18:17.525 --> 01:18:24.251]  And I tell my family, and all my family are, you know, talking about, oh, Jesus this, Jesus that, and you know, they're all, you know, very nice, good people.
[01:18:24.727 --> 01:18:28.375]  But then they're all taking the vaccines and I'm telling them, like, this is the mark of the beast.
[01:18:28.395 --> 01:18:33.307]  They're just getting you ready right now so they can take over, you know, your whole genetic code.
[01:18:33.936 --> 01:18:34.956]  They're everything.
[01:18:34.996 --> 01:18:36.777]  They're just going to take everything from you.
[01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:45.721]  It's not even just... And it sets the precedent that they came out in Stanford and said, oh, we've got a new injection, they call it a vaccine, that fixes your body.
[01:18:45.761 --> 01:18:46.942]  Well, you'll never die.
[01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:49.303]  You're not going to get cancer or Alzheimer's anymore.
[01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:50.123]  All lies.
[01:18:50.443 --> 01:18:54.085]  And it takes over all your genetics in gene rewriting.
[01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:57.406]  So absolutely, this is a genetic, really alien takeover.
[01:18:58.967 --> 01:18:59.707]  Oh yeah, 100%.
[01:18:59.767 --> 01:19:02.008]  And then with this new variant that they have coming out,
[01:19:02.392 --> 01:19:05.657]  I'm pretty sure they're going to have, what, booster shots coming out, what, next year?
[01:19:05.698 --> 01:19:07.320]  Maybe even later on this year.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.105]  I'm like, oh, we got new booster shots for this, you know, variant.
[01:19:10.692 --> 01:19:20.980]  Well, it's already killing people en masse and they're testing to see if they can get away with it.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.242]  Then they're going to up the kill level with the booster shots.
[01:19:23.302 --> 01:19:23.682]  I agree.
[01:19:23.982 --> 01:19:24.943]  Mike Adams is coming up.
[01:19:25.003 --> 01:19:26.044]  More calls next segment.
[01:19:26.424 --> 01:19:28.986]  And we're going to get to Mark first when we come back in Colorado.
[01:19:29.006 --> 01:19:33.009]  But first, here's the new report, the 10 Stages of Genocide by Greg Reese.
[01:19:33.129 --> 01:19:34.791]  Share it now at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:42.148 --> 01:19:47.772]  The word genocide was coined in 1944 by Raphael Lemkin.
[01:19:48.493 --> 01:19:54.037]  It is the first word in the English language to denote something that's been around for all of history.
[01:19:54.758 --> 01:20:00.723]  In France it was known as populicide and in Germany as folk murdering.
[01:20:01.603 --> 01:20:07.045]  Genocide is the age-old action of wiping out large groups of the local population.
[01:20:07.705 --> 01:20:15.247]  Whether it be for economic reasons or non-compliance, genocide is always motivated by political power.
[01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:20.369]  The Ten Stages of Genocide is a model of the genocidal process.
[01:20:21.289 --> 01:20:27.453]  We can use this model to clearly demonstrate the level of genocide many of us are facing today.
[01:20:28.234 --> 01:20:28.854]  Stage 1.
[01:20:29.274 --> 01:20:30.175]  Classification.
[01:20:30.875 --> 01:20:35.198]  All cultures have categories to distinguish people into us and them.
[01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:40.341]  Whether it be ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality.
[01:20:41.022 --> 01:20:42.983]  Classification is seen everywhere.
[01:20:43.663 --> 01:20:46.145]  It seems to be an innate mechanism of the mind.
[01:20:46.705 --> 01:20:50.228]  And America has a great way of keeping this mechanism in check.
[01:20:51.048 --> 01:21:01.717]  E Pluribus Unum, which is why America is such an obvious target of the emerging globalist society, and why we have been divided into two succinct groups.
[01:21:02.598 --> 01:21:04.779]  Patriots loyal to defending the U.S.
[01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.921]  Constitution and everyone else.
[01:21:08.062 --> 01:21:09.984]  Stage 2, Symbolization.
[01:21:10.859 --> 01:21:21.701]  Words such as Republican, Libertarian, and Oath Keepers have now been redefined to mean racist, domestic terrorists, and extremist.
[01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:33.984]  Symbolization makes the work of dividing the people much more efficient, and once divided, allows the compliant group to participate in the genocide against the patriots.
[01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:35.737]  Stage 3.
[01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:36.918]  Discrimination.
[01:21:37.658 --> 01:21:43.800]  The dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of the targeted group.
[01:21:44.641 --> 01:21:55.685]  Private multinational corporations have monopolized all social discourse on the internet and have been blatantly discriminating against patriot voices for years.
[01:21:56.638 --> 01:22:10.372]  We are also beginning to see signs of the coming discrimination against the so-called unvaccinated, who will soon be turned away for not having the official symbol on their mobile device, proving they are a member of the accepted group.
[01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:12.054]  Stage 4.
[01:22:12.975 --> 01:22:13.916]  Dehumanization.
[01:22:14.376 --> 01:22:19.962]  The compliant group is conditioned to deny the humanity of the group being marked for extermination.
[01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:29.314]  They are made to believe that patriotic Americans are ignorant, evil, and inherently racist, and that they would all be better off without them.
[01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:33.700]  Dehumanization overcomes the normal human aversion to murder.
[01:22:34.893 --> 01:22:35.634]  Stage 5.
[01:22:36.074 --> 01:22:36.775]  Organization.
[01:22:37.496 --> 01:22:41.340]  Genocide is always organized, usually by the state.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:46.625]  And the emerging globalist society we are seeing today is highly organized.
[01:22:47.126 --> 01:22:51.210]  They control all of pop culture, the media, and big pharma.
[01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:55.815]  They are most likely the most organized tyranny in all of human history.
[01:22:57.378 --> 01:22:57.718]  Stage 6.
[01:22:58.779 --> 01:22:59.559]  Polarization.
[01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:05.822]  With the previous five stages in effect, the people are now ripe for complete polarization.
[01:23:06.483 --> 01:23:12.786]  Moderates are intimidated into silence, and it becomes accepted that the targeted group must go.
[01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:18.229]  The dominant group passes emergency laws, granting them power over the targeted group.
[01:23:18.889 --> 01:23:22.915]  Such as the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[01:23:23.495 --> 01:23:31.806]  Now that the people have been conditioned to accept that patriotic Americans are now domestic terrorists, the stage is set for genocide.
[01:23:33.055 --> 01:23:35.295]  This is where we definitely are today.
[01:23:36.216 --> 01:23:45.838]  Stage 7 is preparation, when plans are made for the relocation, arrest, or extermination of the targeted group, which is most likely already happening.
[01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:52.919]  Stage 8 is persecution, when the targeted group begins getting arrested and separated from society.
[01:23:53.599 --> 01:24:01.081]  There are already hundreds of innocent patriotic Americans imprisoned indefinitely for protesting the stolen election of 2020.
[01:24:02.998 --> 01:24:06.742]  Stage 9 is extermination, when the mass killing begins.
[01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:09.225]  And stage 10 is denial.
[01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:12.729]  Denial is the glue that makes all of this possible.
[01:24:13.289 --> 01:24:17.153]  It is what has gotten us this far along this dark path so far.
[01:24:17.634 --> 01:24:20.737]  And it is the only thing that will carry it through to the end.
[01:24:21.698 --> 01:24:27.761]  There is no government or United Nations coming to save American patriots from this genocide.
[01:24:28.402 --> 01:24:33.745]  It will be up to the people alone to defeat this emerging global dystopia.
[01:24:34.705 --> 01:24:37.107]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:24:38.447 --> 01:24:40.769]  Your life depends on getting this video out.
[01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:44.551]  It just went live at man.video and freeworldnews.tv.
[01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:46.031]  It's now up to you.
[01:24:46.792 --> 01:24:50.194]  Mike Adams is ready for war!
[01:24:51.749 --> 01:24:54.090]  The Info War is coming up next segment to cover.
[01:24:55.151 --> 01:24:58.612]  Each new chapter in the COVID depopulation plan becomes more insane.
[01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:00.773]  We are living in a nightmare.
[01:25:00.793 --> 01:25:01.874]  They're trying to just normalize it.
[01:25:01.914 --> 01:25:05.155]  We've got to fight like hell to not let them normalize it.
[01:25:05.716 --> 01:25:07.016]  We're taking phone calls right now.
[01:25:07.156 --> 01:25:08.617]  Mark in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[01:25:08.977 --> 01:25:09.517]  You're on the air.
[01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:09.858]  Go ahead.
[01:25:09.878 --> 01:25:11.458]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:13.219]  Good to hear from you.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.300]  Good to hear it.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.001]  Good to have you here, brother.
[01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:17.641]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:17.661 --> 01:25:20.603]  Yeah, the January 6th thing.
[01:25:21.764 --> 01:25:23.224]  Wow, talk about a setup.
[01:25:24.364 --> 01:25:46.609]  I just wanted to get my word out there and say, you know, I almost went to that and what they're doing right now is just crazy that, you know, with the commission to investigate it and everything, I can't believe that even... Yeah, they're setting the precedent to try to scare people from protesting and then demonizing a million people because 500 or 600 went into a Capitol, most of them peaceful.
[01:25:47.129 --> 01:25:48.869]  It's just outrageous.
[01:25:49.850 --> 01:25:55.511]  Yes, and here in Colorado, at least in Colorado Springs, we're pretty conservative.
[01:25:56.492 --> 01:25:58.732]  And we all know that election was stolen.
[01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:02.193]  It's just a matter of them wanting to listen to it.
[01:26:03.833 --> 01:26:08.615]  But anyhow, yeah, the Ashley Babbitt thing, I watched that whole thing live.
[01:26:08.655 --> 01:26:09.715]  It was ridiculous.
[01:26:10.155 --> 01:26:13.436]  I can't believe that they even have a weapon.
[01:26:13.816 --> 01:26:16.997]  And I love how Trump's exposing it.
[01:26:19.198 --> 01:26:19.980]  We're good to go.
[01:26:29.781 --> 01:26:32.604]  Of everything that's been going on, but he tries his best.
[01:26:32.644 --> 01:26:39.731]  You know, I don't think in his heart that he knew that that vaccine... Well, I mean, I just see now that Trump got the elections stolen from him.
[01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:40.091]  It's gone.
[01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:41.192]  People are even madder at him.
[01:26:41.633 --> 01:26:42.694]  We just can't blame Trump.
[01:26:42.714 --> 01:26:44.315]  We gotta blame ourselves and just move forward.
[01:26:44.336 --> 01:26:45.156]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[01:26:45.457 --> 01:26:46.157]  Really appreciate you.
[01:26:46.538 --> 01:26:47.699]  Matthew's in Florida.
[01:26:47.759 --> 01:26:51.282]  He wants to respond to the Jewish conspiracy caller earlier.
[01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:51.603]  Go ahead.
[01:26:53.399 --> 01:27:01.405]  Alex, first, I appreciate you having me on, but to preface what I'm going to say... And I'm sorry, I can't give you nine minutes while the camera's rubbing against the gun.
[01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:02.166]  You've got two minutes.
[01:27:02.186 --> 01:27:02.706]  Go, go.
[01:27:03.647 --> 01:27:11.613]  So, what I wanted to say is I went to Jewish day school, K-12, grandchildren of Holocaust survivors.
[01:27:11.633 --> 01:27:12.894]  My dad was born in DP camp.
[01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:23.358]  He's now a doctor, and all these theories, the Rothschilds, all that stuff, that was part of the propaganda that resulted in my grandparents even being in the concentration camps.
[01:27:24.818 --> 01:27:38.961]  Growing up, though, and seeing that, and being in shuls, where the rabbis seemed to not take the side of Israel the way my Hebrew teachers were taking the side of Israel, when buses would blow up in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
[01:27:39.665 --> 01:28:01.030]  That made me realize, maybe there's something going on here, but at the end of the day, the fact that the Jews have been so persecuted over time, and the fact that in these holidays, all of them involve persecution, whether it's people forcibly coming into private homes and forcing them to eat pork, created a religion, right?
[01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:02.850]  All these things, it was all persecution.
[01:28:03.090 --> 01:28:07.371]  So unless religion was the original syop, and
[01:28:08.348 --> 01:28:13.672]  And we've been fooled this whole time, then there's only really one way to look at it.
[01:28:13.872 --> 01:28:19.537]  And the fact that you have people like Milton Friedman, doesn't that prove something wrong, don't you think?
[01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:39.649]  I mean obviously there's Jews of diverse backgrounds and ideas and that's why I try to just all this stuff becomes a tail chasing deal but then you have the ADL coming out to get rid of free speech and then labeling anybody that's for America bad that that is going to cause major pressure to be put on Jews that are not part
[01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:46.393]  Alex, one other thing, when my dad first came to this country, when they first came here and he was a baby and was growing up,
[01:28:58.827 --> 01:29:13.754]  The only anti-Semitism and discrimination that he experienced in northern New Jersey was from the liberal Jews who said, you guys are diseased, you guys are giving us a bad name, you should go back, why'd you come here, you're making us look bad.
[01:29:14.335 --> 01:29:16.756]  That's what I've seen, I've definitely seen that, thank you sir.
[01:29:17.997 --> 01:29:24.500]  Alright, we were born for this time, and there's no doubt now that the so-called vaccine is deadly.
[01:29:25.362 --> 01:29:28.504]  And that it is causing infertility, heart attacks, all sorts of problems.
[01:29:29.024 --> 01:29:31.906]  All the vaccines were designed according to what Fauci and Bill Gates wanted.
[01:29:32.746 --> 01:29:34.187]  The wheels have completely come off.
[01:29:34.227 --> 01:29:35.648]  The world economy is collapsing.
[01:29:35.688 --> 01:29:36.829]  The third world's imploding.
[01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:40.471]  10 million illegals are coming across just the Texas border.
[01:29:41.011 --> 01:29:45.934]  The Border Patrol estimates 5 million already have, another 5 million by October, end of fiscal year.
[01:29:47.403 --> 01:29:48.884]  This is the collapse of the country.
[01:29:48.904 --> 01:29:54.267]  More than 40% of San Franciscans plan to leave this year, saying the city is deteriorating and has collapsed.
[01:29:54.767 --> 01:29:59.530]  This is a world government plan to collapse and end the social contract.
[01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:10.376]  Mike Adams has been doing a great job over at NaturalNews.com chronicling the insane amount of mainline prestigious studies
[01:30:11.471 --> 01:30:15.834]  That in their attempts to whitewash what's happening, documented.
[01:30:15.854 --> 01:30:27.503]  The New England Journal of Medicine, that's very prestigious, saying that 82% of individuals that are pregnant that take the inoculation, the baby dies.
[01:30:28.749 --> 01:30:29.390]  We've got that.
[01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:32.052]  We've got a British rocker dying from brain hemorrhage.
[01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.415]  I mean, this stuff is every day.
[01:30:34.775 --> 01:30:37.418]  Study links chest pain, heart attacks in the troops.
[01:30:38.079 --> 01:30:42.363]  They've had to put advisements in there saying that it can cause a heart attack.
[01:30:42.784 --> 01:30:45.707]  Norway to pay compensation for AstraZeneca side effects.
[01:30:48.049 --> 01:30:54.750]  And now they're sending the Delta variant teams in to demand their way into your house, which is the next phase of all this.
[01:30:54.810 --> 01:31:01.772]  And they're talking about worldwide mask mandates and more lockdowns, which haven't even ended in places like England and Australia or Canada.
[01:31:02.372 --> 01:31:07.993]  And you have Canadian officials saying, we're doing this to silence everyone for our political takeover.
[01:31:08.493 --> 01:31:09.794]  So there's no longer any doubt.
[01:31:09.814 --> 01:31:11.254]  You hit the moment of emergence.
[01:31:12.093 --> 01:31:15.897]  When the tyranny isn't hiding anymore, it's tanks are rolling against you.
[01:31:16.678 --> 01:31:21.182]  And so Mike Adams is here to talk about the spontaneous abortions.
[01:31:22.365 --> 01:31:24.386]  He's here to talk about the studies.
[01:31:24.426 --> 01:31:27.348]  He's here to talk about why are they giving saline everywhere?
[01:31:27.368 --> 01:31:28.969]  Well, that's for certain groups and not others.
[01:31:29.269 --> 01:31:30.410]  It's in the news now confirmed.
[01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:31.231]  We heard six months ago.
[01:31:31.651 --> 01:31:33.132]  You go into the Walgreens wherever they go.
[01:31:33.192 --> 01:31:33.872]  Oh, you're black?
[01:31:34.133 --> 01:31:34.533]  Oh, let me see.
[01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:35.373]  Oh, you get this shot.
[01:31:35.834 --> 01:31:40.136]  Oh, you're, of course, the Walgreens or CVS or Walmart employees aren't in on it.
[01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:42.157]  They're just following some directive.
[01:31:42.177 --> 01:31:44.959]  But who's running those directives?
[01:31:44.979 --> 01:31:46.680]  We were talking about saline shots six months ago.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.842]  Now it's hundreds of articles.
[01:31:49.522 --> 01:31:50.743]  Where they confirm they're doing it.
[01:31:51.143 --> 01:31:53.964]  Mike Adams is really good at connecting the dots and deciphering things.
[01:31:54.504 --> 01:31:58.626]  Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, thank you so much for spending time with us on this Friday.
[01:32:00.026 --> 01:32:11.151]  Well thank you Alex, it's great to join you and exactly as you mentioned the New England Journal of Medicine published a science paper with a data set that shows that four out of five pregnancies
[01:32:11.977 --> 01:32:21.161]  Where the women are given these COVID injections during the first or second trimesters end in spontaneous abortions in less than 20 weeks.
[01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:24.662]  That's 82% is what the data show.
[01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:40.349]  And yet, at the same time, the study authors apparently attempted to obfuscate that fact, and they included in their denominator of their calculation of the percentage, they included 700 other women who weren't vaccinated until their third trimester,
[01:32:41.158 --> 01:32:52.690]  And then said, well, gosh, these 700 women vaccinated in the third trimester didn't have spontaneous abortions in the first 20 weeks, which they couldn't have, Alex, because pregnant women aren't time travelers.
[01:32:53.231 --> 01:33:00.218]  They can't go back in time and have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks when they're injected in the last eight weeks.
[01:33:00.718 --> 01:33:16.165]  So they use this obfuscation in order to try to conclude that the vaccines really aren't causing any kind of spontaneous abortions when their own data show that it's actually killing 82% of unborn human babies in the first 20 weeks.
[01:33:16.225 --> 01:33:23.989]  So Alex, this is a confirmation that the depopulation component is functioning exactly as engineered.
[01:33:24.489 --> 01:33:32.472]  That they are going to see millions of reductions of live births, probably, just in the next 12 months, who knows, over the next few years.
[01:33:33.052 --> 01:33:38.914]  This is like that Clive Owen sci-fi movie, what was it called, Children of Men, I think?
[01:33:38.974 --> 01:33:40.214]  Yes, where everybody's sterilized.
[01:33:40.995 --> 01:33:41.195]  Right.
[01:33:41.655 --> 01:33:44.396]  We're entering that sci-fi future right now, it's all confirmed.
[01:33:45.796 --> 01:33:56.845]  What about the hundreds of articles I have here, AP, Reuters, all of them, admitting that, oh, it's an accident, thousands here, hundreds here are being given saline.
[01:33:56.885 --> 01:33:58.226]  It's on the bottle, they know the difference.
[01:33:58.507 --> 01:34:03.491]  And they're reportedly looking at laptops, looking at iPads to decide who gets what according to race.
[01:34:03.531 --> 01:34:04.512]  That's in the news now.
[01:34:05.112 --> 01:34:07.374]  There are now hundreds of witnesses that are reporting this.
[01:34:08.775 --> 01:34:12.118]  Well, I think Sherry Tenpenny gave you an excellent answer on this.
[01:34:12.538 --> 01:34:14.320]  I think she was on your show yesterday or the day before.
[01:34:15.044 --> 01:34:20.127]  And she's exactly right that they don't want to make it obvious that they're killing everybody all at once.
[01:34:20.767 --> 01:34:21.528]  And so they do.
[01:34:21.568 --> 01:34:25.010]  They inject some people with saline so they can claim, oh look, it's safe.
[01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.070]  Those people are fine.
[01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:30.092]  But others get the spike protein injection, which is a biological weapon.
[01:34:30.553 --> 01:34:40.258]  But my understanding and my guess here is that as the booster shots roll out, the booster shots will become more and more aggressive in terms of their fatality.
[01:34:40.838 --> 01:34:48.164]  And anybody who is unwise enough to sign up for more booster shots is eventually going to be killed by this biological weapon.
[01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:53.327]  So remember, they have to keep the Delta variant mass hysteria in the media.
[01:34:53.428 --> 01:34:58.691]  And now, as you said, they have these response teams, which, let's just face it, we got to call them Delta Force.
[01:34:59.352 --> 01:35:03.355]  They're like Delta Force government teams now, except they're not defending our country.
[01:35:04.019 --> 01:35:09.825]  They're killing humanity, and they're going to roll out and spread mass hysteria to make sure more people sign up for the booster shots.
[01:35:10.286 --> 01:35:12.047]  And that's where the real death wave kicks in.
[01:35:12.088 --> 01:35:20.777]  So we may only be months away from the real sharp explosion of mass death across America from these vaccines, Alex.
[01:35:21.337 --> 01:35:28.739]  We also have the VAERS report, and the different studies say 10, 50, 100 times more than what is actually reported, but the average is about 40.
[01:35:28.819 --> 01:35:30.479]  They say it's an accurate number.
[01:35:30.819 --> 01:35:39.382]  So if you've got 5,000, 6,000 deaths from the COVID vaccines here in the U.S., and it's 40 times 6,000, that is a gigantic number.
[01:35:39.422 --> 01:35:41.442]  They're banning these shots all over the world.
[01:35:41.482 --> 01:35:42.582]  And for people that ask, what is this?
[01:35:43.042 --> 01:35:44.583]  I believe this is the beta test.
[01:35:45.589 --> 01:35:50.993]  Still incredibly strong to see if we'll put up with all this death, all this disease, all these heart attacks.
[01:35:51.373 --> 01:35:56.056]  Now forcing them to put a warning like it's a pack of cigarettes on these injections.
[01:35:56.537 --> 01:36:00.960]  Is this the big push or is this just the beta for something bigger like you said the booster shots?
[01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:12.615]  Well, these are just the early days of the real extermination war against humanity because, as you said, VAERS is currently reporting over 6,000 deaths following COVID vaccinations.
[01:36:12.655 --> 01:36:19.103]  The real number, in my estimation, is at least 100,000 Americans have been killed by vaccines so far.
[01:36:19.123 --> 01:36:21.566]  It might be a couple hundred thousand, we just don't know for sure.
[01:36:21.946 --> 01:36:29.171]  And let's be clear, in the rat studies, six months that they did at UT in 2012, Fauci paid for, killed most of the rats within six months.
[01:36:29.191 --> 01:36:31.813]  Well, in the life cycle, that's like three or four years in a human.
[01:36:32.213 --> 01:36:35.055]  And so we're going to see a lot more in the future, aren't we?
[01:36:36.016 --> 01:36:36.656]  Well, absolutely.
[01:36:36.896 --> 01:36:39.738]  And don't forget, there's something big that everybody's forgetting about this.
[01:36:40.198 --> 01:36:45.942]  Right now, under emergency use authorization, they are not allowed to mandate these vaccines.
[01:36:46.022 --> 01:36:48.324]  But once they get FDA approval,
[01:36:48.988 --> 01:36:49.828]  Keep going here, Mike.
[01:36:49.848 --> 01:36:54.670]  Tell us, when we come back, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor, what else is on your radar and what we can do.
[01:37:16.508 --> 01:37:21.355]  Okay, well, it is clear this is a global extermination against humanity.
[01:37:22.196 --> 01:37:34.052]  It's in the early phases, it's going to accelerate, and they're going to combine multiple vectors of a grid-down collapse, an economic collapse, a second wave of biowarfare agents launched probably by Communist China.
[01:37:34.552 --> 01:37:54.797]  And I believe, based on my sources, once America is sufficiently weakened from within with internal race wars, and perhaps a civil war if they can engineer that, and maybe nationwide gun confiscation attempts following a false flag attack, then the communists will literally invade the continental United States, perhaps through UN troops or communist Chinese troops,
[01:37:55.237 --> 01:38:04.400]  Working with narco cartels across the southern border, and I've got numerous sources confirming all of this, including the pre-staging of weapons in the United States.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:09.402]  So, the American people are going to be fighting a multi-front war against invaders.
[01:38:10.294 --> 01:38:17.759]  against a rogue element of perhaps the military and bioweapons and a grid-down scenario all at the same time.
[01:38:17.779 --> 01:38:19.620]  This is all happening together by design.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:22.442]  By the way, Mike, I 100% agree with you.
[01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:23.863]  We'll explain why on the other side.
[01:38:23.883 --> 01:38:24.923]  I'm not trying to scare you, folks.
[01:38:25.283 --> 01:38:26.764]  We must mobilize now.
[01:38:26.844 --> 01:38:28.165]  This is the takedown of the U.S.
[01:38:28.565 --> 01:38:30.307]  This is the final minutes of the Republic.
[01:38:30.327 --> 01:38:30.727]  Stay with us.
[01:38:31.467 --> 01:38:35.029]  You know, I'd like to go back to the old days, still an open, free society.
[01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:37.351]  But that's all ending.
[01:38:40.731 --> 01:38:53.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're witnessing unrestricted, undeclared warfare, 21st century attack by major corporations to come in with big media and not tell you that they ordered the Texas power shut off in the official documents.
[01:38:54.317 --> 01:38:57.718]  Said, no, you can't authorize to up your power for the storm.
[01:38:57.778 --> 01:38:58.399]  That was on record.
[01:38:59.659 --> 01:39:02.561]  Or that they shut down the Keystone Pipeline or the Colonial.
[01:39:03.201 --> 01:39:04.121]  Those were all tests.
[01:39:05.002 --> 01:39:07.683]  And so when Mike Adams joining us earlier, back with us now,
[01:39:09.204 --> 01:39:11.286]  ...said this is the beginning of the main assault.
[01:39:11.446 --> 01:39:17.592]  This is the shutdown of the economy, the shutdown of the power grid, the collapse of all the major blue cities.
[01:39:20.327 --> 01:39:25.050]  A race war is the cover to then bring in the foreign UN troops under the Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.690]  It's all official.
[01:39:27.311 --> 01:39:27.771]  It's here.
[01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:33.894]  And the Pentagon's saying, it's not China, it's not any foreign countries a threat, it's the American people.
[01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:35.475]  People that don't want lockdowns.
[01:39:35.955 --> 01:39:37.676]  People that don't want forced inoculations.
[01:39:37.956 --> 01:39:39.237]  People that question elections.
[01:39:41.238 --> 01:39:44.780]  Declaring us the enemy and spying on Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:47.199 --> 01:39:47.640]  It happened.
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:49.422]  We let them kill the babies.
[01:39:49.462 --> 01:39:50.603]  We let them do all the GMO.
[01:39:50.623 --> 01:39:51.184]  We let them do it all.
[01:39:51.464 --> 01:39:53.367]  And so they're going for broke now.
[01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:55.810]  And Klaus Schwab says we're going to censor the whole internet.
[01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:57.091]  We're going to take control of everybody.
[01:39:57.432 --> 01:39:59.374]  We're going to control things with corporate governance.
[01:39:59.595 --> 01:40:00.396]  What you can say and do.
[01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:02.098]  We're going to suppress medical treatments.
[01:40:03.882 --> 01:40:05.243]  Still pay insufficient attention.
[01:40:29.019 --> 01:40:45.529]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:55.155]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison
[01:40:56.428 --> 01:40:58.651]  To a major cyber attack.
[01:40:59.592 --> 01:41:08.984]  To use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cyber.
[01:41:10.228 --> 01:41:22.658]  So, he says he wants to know people, he wants to cut carbon, he said COVID helped us do less, now he says, oh, a big power outage is coming, oh, it's going to be so terrible, so he'll be the hero once that happens.
[01:41:22.698 --> 01:41:26.401]  Mike Adams, this is all scripted, it's all prepared, it's all happening now, what do we do?
[01:41:27.924 --> 01:41:43.230]  See, when he talks about this coming cyber grid attack, you know, he's saying it licking his lips, you know, with a sense of joy, with a sense of knowing that this is what's coming, the same way Fauci warned that Trump was going to have to deal with a biological weapons attack.
[01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:45.091]  They know it's coming because they're engineering it.
[01:41:45.631 --> 01:41:52.294]  But I want to bring people's attention to a really important metaphor in all of this, that condo collapse in Miami.
[01:41:53.118 --> 01:41:57.222]  And of course, my prayers go out to all the innocent victims of that collapse.
[01:41:57.242 --> 01:42:00.625]  But there was one woman who I believe lived on the 7th floor.
[01:42:01.286 --> 01:42:05.050]  She ran out of the building because she heard a sound.
[01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:06.311]  She got up.
[01:42:06.671 --> 01:42:08.373]  It was like 2 or 3 in the morning when this happened.
[01:42:08.393 --> 01:42:12.697]  She got up and she saw a giant crack appear in the wall.
[01:42:13.118 --> 01:42:16.501]  A crack that she said was two fingers wide in terms of its gap.
[01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:23.103]  And she heard sounds and her balcony door would no longer shut because the geometry of the doorway had shifted.
[01:42:23.583 --> 01:42:26.204]  She immediately realized, hey, I've got to get out.
[01:42:26.804 --> 01:42:28.004]  Something's not right with this.
[01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:30.365]  And she ran down seven flights and she got out.
[01:42:30.845 --> 01:42:33.146]  She survived and the building collapsed behind her.
[01:42:33.206 --> 01:42:35.907]  Now, why is this important to understand?
[01:42:36.307 --> 01:42:39.328]  Because right now, Alex, your viewers, my listeners,
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.626]  Those are the people who are seeing the signs of the collapse that is about to accelerate at the speed of gravity here.
[01:42:46.766 --> 01:42:47.727]  I totally agree.
[01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:53.632]  It's a metaphor, like Deepwater Horizon was, or this, of the collapse that's already begun.
[01:42:53.892 --> 01:42:56.395]  The cracks are already there, the door is already crooked.
[01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:08.255]  Yes, and for those who are wise enough to see what's happening and to then adjust, adapt, escape this problem or be prepared, they will be the survivors.
[01:43:08.555 --> 01:43:21.742]  While most people did not survive because they never saw the signs or they were asleep and it happened during their sleep hours, but for those who are willing to pay attention, you can see what's about to happen and all of your viewers can see it.
[01:43:22.142 --> 01:43:23.803]  It's now in our faces.
[01:43:23.903 --> 01:43:28.165]  They implode us and then invade us as quote saviors with international I-44s.
[01:43:28.866 --> 01:43:30.687]  Describe how the dominoes fall.
[01:43:31.267 --> 01:43:35.910]  Could be next week, could be six months from now, but you can see this is the imminent modern attack.
[01:43:36.190 --> 01:43:36.990]  We are under attack.
[01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:38.571]  America is falling right now.
[01:43:38.591 --> 01:43:48.116]  Well, one thing that's clear to me is that they won't launch the land invasion of the continental United States until they believe they have confiscated some significant portion of the firearms.
[01:43:48.657 --> 01:43:50.218]  So, the sequence that I see...
[01:43:51.897 --> 01:43:52.397]  Exactly.
[01:43:52.777 --> 01:43:54.298]  They're going to try to launch a race war.
[01:43:54.318 --> 01:44:00.519]  They're going to pull off a false flag event, try to blame, of course, the gun owners and Trump supporters and Christians and so on.
[01:44:01.159 --> 01:44:06.500]  They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns, which I believe people will not comply.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:13.582]  That would be insane at this point with the police being defunded and violent crime exploding, you know, all across liberal cities everywhere.
[01:44:13.622 --> 01:44:16.683]  People need self-defense more than ever, including, by the way, women.
[01:44:17.743 --> 01:44:25.247]  And people of color and also gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns more than ever before right now.
[01:44:25.307 --> 01:44:27.708]  So it's the left that's buying guns more than ever.
[01:44:27.748 --> 01:44:32.471]  So it's going to make gun control very difficult among left-wing legislators.
[01:44:32.731 --> 01:44:35.873]  So they're going to try to push a false flag and they're going to try to take the guns.
[01:44:36.513 --> 01:44:41.676]  If we, the American people, if we surrender our guns, I believe we will be invaded.
[01:44:42.256 --> 01:44:57.792]  By the way, it's confirmed by the Canadian military now that Chinese troops are massing in Canada.
[01:44:58.072 --> 01:45:03.998]  Canada's under martial law, so we don't let people go outside, they might talk, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops, bare minimum, are massing.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:05.900]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:21.128]  They're massing in the North, in Canada, but the larger movement will, I believe, come from the South, because for many years, and I've confirmed this with numerous sources, Communist Chinese military generals have been training a narco-cartel.
[01:45:21.488 --> 01:45:22.069]  We're good to go.
[01:45:42.228 --> 01:45:44.669]  You will be invaded and you will be slaughtered.
[01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:50.692]  This is not just about defending, you know, the right for self-defense against the tyrannical government.
[01:45:51.072 --> 01:45:53.593]  This is about defending the nation against foreign invaders.
[01:45:53.974 --> 01:45:55.134]  And Mike, you're totally right.
[01:45:55.174 --> 01:45:57.595]  We're in the climate of a takedown.
[01:45:58.276 --> 01:46:04.458]  They're not going to just launch a bio-attack through vaccines that kills tens of millions and then let us get mad and take the government back.
[01:46:04.779 --> 01:46:09.821]  You only do that as a preparatory phase to soften everyone up ahead of an even bigger attack.
[01:46:10.101 --> 01:46:11.722]  The attacks are going to get exponential.
[01:46:13.171 --> 01:46:25.914]  Yeah, exactly, and then add in a grid-down scenario where you lose the basic infrastructure of functioning American communities and add in a potential financial collapse and race wars and possible EMP weapons.
[01:46:25.954 --> 01:46:28.055]  I mean, this is a total takedown.
[01:46:28.095 --> 01:46:28.575]  It's coming.
[01:46:28.995 --> 01:46:32.896]  We've got to plan to be able to survive and defend our nation off-grid.
[01:46:33.836 --> 01:46:34.336]  Off-grid.
[01:46:34.496 --> 01:46:37.797]  And I think you agree it's going to be before the midterms they try to fully take the U.S.
[01:46:37.817 --> 01:46:37.957]  down?
[01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.179]  That's what it seems like, yes.
[01:46:40.539 --> 01:46:44.080]  Although there may be delays in their plan, but that's their intention.
[01:46:44.421 --> 01:46:44.981]  Alright, stay there.
[01:46:45.041 --> 01:46:49.102]  Mike Adams, more on the deadly bio-attack confirmed in the vaccines.
[01:46:49.462 --> 01:46:51.563]  The extermination of America happening right now.
[01:46:52.043 --> 01:46:53.543]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:53.763 --> 01:46:55.604]  I want to be 100% clear with our listeners and viewers.
[01:46:57.551 --> 01:46:59.271]  I'm not saying all this to be sensational.
[01:46:59.912 --> 01:47:08.034]  They have given experimental vaccines that we know Fauci tested at the UT Level 4 weapons lab that killed almost all the mice and rats they tested it on.
[01:47:08.934 --> 01:47:16.876]  They knew before they put this out it would cause heart attacks, it would cause bleeding in the brain, and it's happened.
[01:47:17.656 --> 01:47:20.837]  And now they're trying to cover that up, and the death rate's off the charts.
[01:47:20.897 --> 01:47:25.718]  So, when you hit your own country with something of that level,
[01:47:27.688 --> 01:47:35.749]  You're only doing it because you plan to do something even worse that'll distract folks from that, then the next attack will be even bigger.
[01:47:35.769 --> 01:47:37.410]  So we're asking, what is the big attack?
[01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:41.950]  You read about history, you hear about times with millions dead, wars and starving and death.
[01:47:43.011 --> 01:47:44.671]  That's when countries didn't agree with each other.
[01:47:44.911 --> 01:47:50.872]  We have a global corporate system playing countries off against each other, bringing in a nightmare program.
[01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:53.192]  And so the sky's the limit.
[01:47:53.292 --> 01:47:56.753]  What do we do, Mike Adams, to telegraph to the deep state
[01:47:58.221 --> 01:48:10.565]  You know, to the George Soros's and the New World Order types, that they're not going to get away with this because they have really set loose the fires of race war and division and collapse.
[01:48:10.585 --> 01:48:19.647]  The lockdowns already caused the third world to collapse and massive migrant waves the UN is using as a political and economic and cultural and military weapon.
[01:48:20.247 --> 01:48:21.328]  I mean, the big picture
[01:48:22.048 --> 01:48:23.209]  The world's on fire!
[01:48:23.269 --> 01:48:24.410]  The world's disintegrating!
[01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:26.572]  Blue cities by design are imploding!
[01:48:27.032 --> 01:48:28.894]  Not just here, but all over the world they're doing this!
[01:48:29.834 --> 01:48:32.216]  How do you see them playing this out, and how do we counter it?
[01:48:33.397 --> 01:48:43.606]  Well, let me be clear, and I know this is going to sound odd, but long term I'm an optimist in how this plays out, because, well, for the following reasons, and plus we have God on our side.
[01:48:44.166 --> 01:48:50.952]  But in the short term, I believe the globalists will succeed in mass murdering at least a billion human beings on our planet today,
[01:48:51.767 --> 01:48:52.288]  Maybe more.
[01:48:52.828 --> 01:48:55.870]  They will succeed in taking down the America that we once knew.
[01:48:55.890 --> 01:49:06.317]  I believe the Republic will fall, but it will be reborn by the survivors and the rebuilders, who are the people, the kind of people that watch this very show.
[01:49:06.877 --> 01:49:15.843]  And the reason is because the globalists, in order for them to succeed long-term, they have to achieve a near 99% extermination, and they won't.
[01:49:16.604 --> 01:49:17.684]  They may exterminate 25
[01:49:19.326 --> 01:49:23.211]  Well, you're saying it so smart, I've got to interrupt.
[01:49:23.231 --> 01:49:23.631]  You're right.
[01:49:24.352 --> 01:49:27.776]  And the people say, well, they're losing and they're only getting a low percentage to inoculate.
[01:49:27.816 --> 01:49:28.437]  Why are they doing it?
[01:49:28.997 --> 01:49:31.000]  Once they triggered this, they can't turn back.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.082]  It's like a boulder going downhill.
[01:49:33.362 --> 01:49:34.584]  They've already initiated the war.
[01:49:34.664 --> 01:49:35.305]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:49:36.192 --> 01:49:40.917]  Yes, they've initiated the war, but they've already failed in the long run because so many people are aware of it.
[01:49:41.357 --> 01:49:44.600]  They did not succeed in silencing every voice of truth.
[01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:48.084]  They did not succeed, although they tried desperately, especially with Infowars.
[01:49:48.745 --> 01:49:55.772]  But the other thing is that the answer for those of us who are going to rebuild a new society rooted in principles of liberty
[01:49:56.733 --> 01:49:59.675]  The new America, as I call it.
[01:49:59.795 --> 01:50:05.280]  All we've got to do is survive this engineered collapse, which means we've got to be prepared.
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:11.825]  We've got to be ready for no power grid for six months or a year, no food supplies for a year or longer, and so on.
[01:50:12.245 --> 01:50:16.609]  We've got to be prepared, and mentally prepared as well, for what's coming.
[01:50:17.613 --> 01:50:24.355]  Once we make it through that, and I'm not saying it's going to be easy, a lot of lives will be lost, families will be destroyed, you know, it's going to be hell.
[01:50:24.896 --> 01:50:34.299]  But if we get through that, then we will succeed in rebuilding society and defeating the globalist agenda, because at that point, they will have nowhere left to hide.
[01:50:34.699 --> 01:50:36.960]  And by the way Mike, we're not just saying this.
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:38.601]  All the globalists explained to them.
[01:50:38.961 --> 01:50:40.142]  We told people this 10 years ago.
[01:50:40.182 --> 01:50:42.023]  Now it's in all the New York Times, Washington Post.
[01:50:42.423 --> 01:50:43.624]  They've got armored redoubts.
[01:50:43.644 --> 01:50:44.584]  They've run to New Zealand.
[01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:45.405]  They've run to Kauai.
[01:50:45.425 --> 01:50:46.425]  They've run to Tasmania.
[01:50:46.725 --> 01:50:48.346]  They've run up to Northern Canada.
[01:50:48.726 --> 01:50:50.467]  They're all digging in and leaving and hiding.
[01:50:50.527 --> 01:50:51.588]  I mean, they've done this.
[01:50:51.628 --> 01:50:52.328]  They've triggered this.
[01:50:52.648 --> 01:50:53.709]  We're not trying to be negative.
[01:50:53.729 --> 01:50:54.710]  We're not trying to scare people.
[01:50:54.970 --> 01:50:57.451]  They've initiated the damn collapse of the planet.
[01:50:58.131 --> 01:50:59.012]  It's so horrible.
[01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:00.012]  It's just horrible.
[01:51:01.453 --> 01:51:02.934]  And, you know, realize that
[01:51:04.112 --> 01:51:06.214]  Preparing is not just about self-defense.
[01:51:06.614 --> 01:51:10.236]  It's not just about defending your life or your family or your community or even your nation.
[01:51:10.617 --> 01:51:16.881]  At this point, preparedness is the most important pro-human activity in which you can engage.
[01:51:17.461 --> 01:51:20.223]  And I'm really trying to emphasize with people in my own work
[01:51:20.763 --> 01:51:23.525]  About being ready for off-grid situations.
[01:51:23.625 --> 01:51:36.692]  So, and this is not a commercial plug for any company I know, but just have a solar, you know, power bank, a solar generator as it's sometimes called, have a way to gather solar energy, store it in a device so you can charge your cell phone.
[01:51:36.712 --> 01:51:46.378]  For five years it's, I better be off the grid, I better have everything, I better get ready, and I'm not even myself ready because I'm so busy fighting up on the front lines, but I mean, absolutely, you can see this.
[01:51:47.332 --> 01:51:48.412]  Yeah, no, I know the feeling.
[01:51:48.452 --> 01:51:49.413]  I have the same conundrum.
[01:51:49.453 --> 01:51:55.055]  It's like, how much should I spend, how much time doing videos and helping others versus doing my own preparedness, right?
[01:51:55.375 --> 01:52:03.539]  So we all, we try to balance this, but everybody's got to be ready to operate off-grid, which means off-grid food, off-grid food preservation.
[01:52:04.519 --> 01:52:11.442]  Off-grid, being able to charge small electronic devices, such as a night vision device, you know, for security, or a radio.
[01:52:11.462 --> 01:52:15.604]  Let's talk about what it's going to look like if they do a three-month power grid off.
[01:52:15.964 --> 01:52:19.786]  That'll create irrevocable problems, 50 times worse than the COVID lockdown.
[01:52:19.826 --> 01:52:23.027]  You'll have just masses of burning cities, starving people.
[01:52:23.047 --> 01:52:25.448]  It'll look like a zombie apocalypse within two weeks.
[01:52:26.528 --> 01:52:32.391]  It will absolutely be a zombie apocalypse, and there will be mass migrations out of the cities for those who can survive the trek.
[01:52:32.975 --> 01:52:40.358]  Now, cities like Los Angeles, being that there's so much desert to the east of L.A., there won't be that many survivors who can walk out on foot from Los Angeles.
[01:52:40.898 --> 01:52:41.078]  L.A.
[01:52:41.098 --> 01:52:43.019]  will be turned into a massive death zone.
[01:52:43.919 --> 01:52:49.881]  It seems to have already begun with some of the videos I've seen with the massive homeless camps, the trash everywhere.
[01:52:50.261 --> 01:52:53.202]  It's a city in collapse, but that's going to happen in Chicago.
[01:52:53.242 --> 01:52:55.343]  It's going to happen in Miami, in Houston.
[01:52:55.563 --> 01:52:56.706]  See Mike, people don't get it.
[01:52:56.766 --> 01:52:59.973]  Civilization with our top engineers was hard to continue.
[01:53:00.294 --> 01:53:04.544]  Once the globalists made us decadent and evil and started shutting it down, it will collapse.
[01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:05.806]  They've initiated it.
[01:53:06.854 --> 01:53:14.320]  Yeah, we're going to have a combination, I say, of I Am Legend with Will Smith and Idiocracy with Mike Judge.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.904]  So we're going to have legendary idiocracy, basically, all across America.
[01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:24.249]  Just mass death, mass collapse, people who are unprepared, clueless, have no idea what to do.
[01:53:24.789 --> 01:53:27.572]  And then you're going to have this small contingent of survivors.
[01:53:28.172 --> 01:53:34.293]  Who are the veterans, you know, former law enforcement, retired cops, preppers, people who watch this show.
[01:53:34.713 --> 01:53:36.814]  These are the people who are going to be the survivors.
[01:53:36.834 --> 01:53:39.274]  We're going to have a mass die-off in the United States.
[01:53:39.294 --> 01:53:40.514]  There's no question in my mind.
[01:53:40.854 --> 01:53:44.235]  And I mean tens of millions of people will die because of what's being engineered.
[01:53:44.635 --> 01:53:47.016]  Without a power grid, every major city collapses.
[01:53:47.436 --> 01:53:54.817]  And you'll have a 70 to 80 percent fatality rate in those cities, even according to government reports on
[01:53:55.257 --> 01:54:02.686]  And so they're just starting the euthanasia because by the time there's a full collapse no one will notice why everybody's dying because it'll just be no food anyways.
[01:54:03.925 --> 01:54:16.474]  Yes, I think they also know that when the collapse comes there'll be very limited resources and they're trying to pre-exterminate as many people as possible so that those people aren't taking the food supplies that a lot of these Democrat governors have squirreled away.
[01:54:16.515 --> 01:54:25.121]  And they're testing the media and they detect, if you'll cover up treatments for viruses, and if you'll cover up mothers that kids die, you'll cover up anything during what's about to happen.
[01:54:25.141 --> 01:54:26.062]  There's all this to test.
[01:54:27.247 --> 01:54:34.531]  Yeah, I know, but what's fascinating is the relevance of media and even the internet will be obsolete when the grid goes down.
[01:54:34.551 --> 01:54:38.093]  I mean, think about it, folks, there will be no functioning internet for this period of time.
[01:54:38.494 --> 01:54:45.057]  Not forever, but as the grid is down, there's no internet, there's no media, there's not even cryptocurrency when the grid's down, see?
[01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:49.340]  So you've got to have backup plans, you've got to have food, you've got to have soap
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:55:03.147]  Well, I think there's no doubt that all the retailers are going to be looted very, very quickly.
[01:55:03.307 --> 01:55:06.889]  Some may have a defense, as you mentioned, and they may be able to hold out for some period of time.
[01:55:07.249 --> 01:55:16.954]  But once the starvation spectrum kicks in, you know, when people reach famine, their behavior shifts quite dramatically and they drop any pretense of polite interaction.
[01:55:16.974 --> 01:55:18.955]  Humans become psychotic murdering machines.
[01:55:19.275 --> 01:55:19.775]  Absolutely.
[01:55:20.476 --> 01:55:20.916]  You said it.
[01:55:20.996 --> 01:55:22.137]  Psychotic murdering machines.
[01:55:22.497 --> 01:55:23.738]  Or zombies, as we say.
[01:55:24.098 --> 01:55:24.698]  And that's coming.
[01:55:24.938 --> 01:55:25.919]  That's absolutely coming.
[01:55:26.239 --> 01:55:27.380]  The shortages are real.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:28.240]  The food shortages.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.262]  You've probably seen it in your commercial operations.
[01:55:30.322 --> 01:55:30.922]  I know I have.
[01:55:31.402 --> 01:55:32.283]  The shortages are real.
[01:55:32.523 --> 01:55:33.644]  Supply lines are collapsing.
[01:55:33.664 --> 01:55:35.265]  I was talking to Norm Pattis in Connecticut.
[01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:36.906]  He said the store shelves are half bare.
[01:55:38.148 --> 01:55:39.169]  I'm not surprised.
[01:55:39.789 --> 01:55:47.991]  Yeah, it's going to get way worse, and they are intentionally shutting down food production by using COVID as an excuse in many cases.
[01:55:48.272 --> 01:55:51.473]  And also, transportation lines are completely maxed out.
[01:55:51.713 --> 01:55:54.114]  They can't get enough truck drivers, trains, ships, anything.
[01:55:54.474 --> 01:55:55.894]  So, it's coming, folks.
[01:55:56.094 --> 01:55:58.435]  They threw a snarl into the whole supply chain.
[01:55:58.715 --> 01:56:00.556]  Meanwhile, Gates is buying up all the farmland.
[01:56:00.936 --> 01:56:02.056]  Four on the other side of this.
[01:56:03.377 --> 01:56:04.077]  You're exactly right.
[01:56:04.929 --> 01:56:06.710]  Mike Adams' most powerful interview ever with you.
[01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.752]  Let's come back and talk about more solutions.
[01:56:08.772 --> 01:56:10.072]  We've given folks the bad news.
[01:56:10.313 --> 01:56:11.934]  Let's talk about survival straight ahead.
[01:56:13.154 --> 01:56:15.736]  Alright, Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com is our guest.
[01:56:16.477 --> 01:56:17.257]  He's dead on.
[01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.959]  This is a real analysis.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.063]  You see times in history where civilizations, societies, commit suicide.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.701]  And it's being done again.
[01:56:28.721 --> 01:56:36.065]  It's a very dangerous move by the ruling class, but they really believe that the Earth's overpopulated and they're saving people, you know, saving themselves.
[01:56:36.085 --> 01:56:39.427]  But at the end of the day, they're really psychotics.
[01:56:41.553 --> 01:56:44.395]  Mike, why would they try such a reckless move?
[01:56:44.935 --> 01:56:47.276]  Is it because their whole pedophile network was being exposed?
[01:56:47.336 --> 01:56:48.837]  Globalism was being challenged?
[01:56:48.857 --> 01:56:50.078]  We knew they had this on the shelf.
[01:56:50.498 --> 01:56:51.198]  They'd written about it.
[01:56:51.238 --> 01:56:53.700]  They talked about it in all those different documents like lockstep.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:55.641]  But now they're doing it.
[01:56:55.661 --> 01:57:03.565]  I mean, this is just, we now know for sure the super bold move to give somebody a vaccine doesn't protect you from COVID.
[01:57:04.145 --> 01:57:07.749]  And gives you blood clots all over your body and grows crystals in your brain.
[01:57:07.769 --> 01:57:14.036]  I mean, just, and of course, because they want to hit us, everybody's dying once the collapse hits.
[01:57:14.616 --> 01:57:17.779]  And it'll just make it a hundred times worse because your family will be dying around you.
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:18.961]  I mean, this is it.
[01:57:19.061 --> 01:57:20.783]  People need to know this is the genocide.
[01:57:21.203 --> 01:57:24.525]  Well, you've hit upon something really important, so yes, the election of Trump.
[01:57:41.537 --> 01:57:49.426]  Uh, in fact, cause well and populism growing all around the world, even with Brexit, for example, cause the globalists to have to accelerate their plans.
[01:57:49.887 --> 01:57:54.031]  So, like you said, they were originally shooting for a lot of this for 2030 or 2035.
[01:57:54.452 --> 01:57:59.538]  They moved it up because of the populist uprising and Trump's people were able to then.
[01:58:00.078 --> 01:58:00.779]  We're good to go.
[01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:33.320]  So the fact that you and I are on the air right now, the fact that Tucker Carlson is on the air, this is going to be the downfall because they can't cover up the truth like they had planned.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:40.123]  They needed about five more years to take everybody offline and then they could roll this out and there would be no dissenting views.
[01:58:40.603 --> 01:58:44.865]  But because, again, because of Trump's victory and the populist uprising, they had to accelerate that.
[01:58:45.345 --> 01:58:47.366]  I 100% agree with that analysis.
[01:58:47.586 --> 01:58:49.767]  They even admit they accelerated their plan.
[01:58:49.807 --> 01:58:50.767]  We forced them to.
[01:58:51.107 --> 01:58:55.348]  So as bad as it is, they'll only be able to kill 20% of the world population instead of 90.
[01:58:55.528 --> 01:59:00.990]  And in the end, once now the people know it's an attack, they can't stop the attack once they launch it.
[01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:03.931]  It'll generate total rebellion and their annihilation in the end.
[01:59:04.271 --> 01:59:08.753]  The question is, are they crazy enough to start a nuclear war to try to get rid of us even faster?
[01:59:10.257 --> 01:59:11.018]  Well, perhaps.
[01:59:11.438 --> 01:59:16.783]  I believe it's possible that they may use nuclear weapons to strike military targets in the United States.
[01:59:16.863 --> 01:59:26.392]  But let's remember that the globalists, ultimately, they want America's food-producing farmland, especially for communist China that can't produce a sufficient food supply domestically.
[01:59:26.472 --> 01:59:29.515]  And that's why the Chinese agent Gates is buying it all up.
[01:59:30.777 --> 01:59:39.146]  Well, exactly right, and this is also why bioweapons that target specifically human tissue were one of the priority weapons, because it doesn't destroy the farmland.
[01:59:39.527 --> 01:59:46.875]  In fact, the ACE2 receptor targets for the spike protein, which are in the vaccines, they don't even harm animals.
[01:59:46.975 --> 01:59:47.796]  It's only humans.
[01:59:48.136 --> 01:59:50.359]  It's targeted to humans so they can kill off the American people.
[01:59:50.379 --> 01:59:52.181]  It's a biological neutron bomb.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:53.801]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:53.821 --> 01:59:54.981]  That's a good way to say it.
[01:59:55.081 --> 01:59:55.882]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:59:56.202 --> 02:00:03.888]  Because, you see, they want America's rivers and farmlands and soils and ports, you know, roadways, bridges, highways.
[02:00:03.928 --> 02:00:05.189]  They want the infrastructure.
[02:00:05.769 --> 02:00:09.692]  If there's any infrastructure left after Biden, you know, ruins everything.
[02:00:10.013 --> 02:00:11.814]  But they want America's infrastructure.
[02:00:11.834 --> 02:00:13.075]  They don't want the American people.
[02:00:13.595 --> 02:00:14.716]  So they've had to accelerate all this.
[02:00:14.736 --> 02:00:22.542]  But I think what has been set into motion now is actually going to end up in the total destruction of the globalists.
[02:00:23.197 --> 02:00:26.180]  Now America will suffer serious wounds.
[02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:29.563]  And the nation that we once knew will never come back.
[02:00:29.943 --> 02:00:32.826]  We're not going back to 2019 ever again.
[02:00:32.966 --> 02:00:37.150]  But America, it won't be erased from history.
[02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:40.793]  We will surge back with liberty and patriotism.
[02:00:40.813 --> 02:00:41.794]  The fun and games are over.
[02:00:42.967 --> 02:00:51.971]  Well, absolutely, and people now realize, or assume they will, as the people around them keep dying from this vaccine, they will realize this is a life-and-death fight.
[02:00:52.092 --> 02:00:57.774]  This is a fight for survival to the very end, that the globalists want a quote, final solution against humanity.
[02:00:58.134 --> 02:01:02.997]  And in fact, you know, just going back to what we opened up this hour with, the vaccines that attack pregnant women
[02:01:03.985 --> 02:01:05.366]  That's a vaccine holocaust.
[02:01:05.747 --> 02:01:09.450]  That's a holocaust-scale attack on human babies.
[02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:17.396]  In fact, they're probably going to kill so many babies that Planned Parenthood will complain that they don't have enough babies left to slaughter because they're all killed by the vaccine.
[02:01:17.416 --> 02:01:19.818]  They already admit birth rates are record low in the U.S.
[02:01:19.878 --> 02:01:23.561]  and worldwide just from the lockdown and record-level miscarriages with the injections.
[02:01:23.581 --> 02:01:26.303]  Yeah, folks, they've committed.
[02:01:26.343 --> 02:01:26.944]  We're in it now.
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:28.841]  Exactly.
[02:01:28.941 --> 02:01:31.603]  And they've already made tactical mistakes.
[02:01:32.024 --> 02:01:36.588]  They have overexposed themselves in ways that are going to come back on them.
[02:01:37.008 --> 02:01:38.329]  But they can't pull it back now.
[02:01:38.429 --> 02:01:39.030]  It's too late.
[02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:43.534]  Why do you think they pulled Yanks out a month ago and removed him from a command position?
[02:01:45.345 --> 02:01:45.845]  Well, I don't know.
[02:01:45.865 --> 02:01:47.707]  There's a lot of theories about Gates.
[02:01:47.727 --> 02:02:01.055]  I can't speculate right now until more information comes out, but I think he's... Well, okay, my guess is a lot of new information is about to come out about Gates, perhaps related to Maxwell and Corey Case.
[02:02:01.075 --> 02:02:01.656]  That's my guess.
[02:02:02.654 --> 02:02:03.614]  But that's just a guess.
[02:02:03.654 --> 02:02:06.535]  I don't have solid intel on that, so I won't speculate further.
[02:02:07.075 --> 02:02:09.796]  But there are major actions in play here.
[02:02:10.577 --> 02:02:12.517]  It's going to look very bad for some period of time.
[02:02:12.997 --> 02:02:18.259]  But those of us who are dedicated to survival and America and to God, we can make it through.
[02:02:18.419 --> 02:02:20.840]  And that's the most important message I want to share today, Alex.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.101]  With your audience in mind is don't give up.
[02:02:24.161 --> 02:02:26.141]  Don't let them win the psychological warfare.
[02:02:26.441 --> 02:02:27.381]  You can make it through.
[02:02:27.781 --> 02:02:28.722]  We can survive.
[02:02:29.082 --> 02:02:32.703]  We come from ancestors who were survivors and pioneers.
[02:02:33.243 --> 02:02:36.563]  They went across America in wagons through harsh winters.
[02:02:36.823 --> 02:02:38.624]  Hey, if they can make it, we can too.
[02:02:38.964 --> 02:02:42.165]  And it's our job not to be victims, but to save people around us.
[02:02:42.485 --> 02:02:43.405]  We're going to be the leaders.
[02:02:44.145 --> 02:02:49.227]  Folks, if you think Mike and I and others are prominent now and people are like, oh my god, Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones now.
[02:02:49.427 --> 02:02:52.247]  Well, everybody's going to be Alex Jones because I just woke up earlier than other people.
[02:02:52.567 --> 02:02:54.228]  And Mike woke up the same time I did.
[02:02:54.628 --> 02:02:57.649]  Now everybody's going to get we were right once this all hits.
[02:02:57.889 --> 02:03:02.130]  And so we're going to have a real leg up on the enemy as long as we survive and persevere.
[02:03:02.670 --> 02:03:04.631]  Most of the left is going to die in their own cities.
[02:03:05.626 --> 02:03:26.424]  Well, exactly right, and even if you and I personally don't survive this, because, you know, they are out to kill some of us, even if we don't survive, the philosophy that we espouse will absolutely survive, and it will live on, and this nation will be great again, and the left will have only achieved the mass extermination of themselves.
[02:03:26.804 --> 02:03:29.707]  96% of Democrats are taking the vaccine, or plan to.
[02:03:29.727 --> 02:03:29.707]  96%.
[02:03:29.747 --> 02:03:31.989]  Have you ever felt the urgency, Mike?
[02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:34.711]  The urgency we feel now.
[02:03:34.751 --> 02:03:37.572]  I mean, this is like 50 times the urgency I ever felt.
[02:03:37.632 --> 02:03:41.273]  I mean, my whole gut, my intellect knows, man, it's about to get crazy.
[02:03:42.114 --> 02:03:42.294]  Yeah.
[02:03:42.774 --> 02:03:43.394]  No, it is.
[02:03:43.654 --> 02:03:44.595]  You absolutely get it.
[02:03:44.795 --> 02:03:45.295]  And I get it.
[02:03:45.415 --> 02:03:50.737]  And we're very open with our audiences here that we don't know how long we'll be on the air.
[02:03:51.117 --> 02:03:53.618]  We don't know how long the food supply chains will function.
[02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:57.220]  We don't know how long there will be any remaining rule of law in this nation.
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.521]  We have no idea.
[02:03:58.621 --> 02:04:00.484]  It could be weeks or months away.
[02:04:00.724 --> 02:04:03.007]  We don't know if the power grid is going to function tomorrow.
[02:04:03.027 --> 02:04:04.128]  We absolutely do not know.
[02:04:04.148 --> 02:04:07.252]  It'll start just suddenly with the police walking off, the border collapsing.
[02:04:07.272 --> 02:04:07.953]  It's already happening.
[02:04:08.213 --> 02:04:09.575]  And just suddenly things are burning.
[02:04:09.615 --> 02:04:10.677]  Suddenly the electricity's off.
[02:04:10.917 --> 02:04:12.359]  And then you're just... the rest of your life.
[02:04:13.339 --> 02:04:16.601]  Well, also just look historically at the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:04:16.761 --> 02:04:24.827]  So one day they defaulted on, you know, 90 billion dollars, I think, in national debt, you know, the equivalent of Treasury bills.
[02:04:25.207 --> 02:04:31.772]  And then three days later, all the regions declared their own independence and sovereignty and the whole system fell apart.
[02:04:31.932 --> 02:04:32.172]  Boom!
[02:04:32.212 --> 02:04:32.673]  Just like that.
[02:04:33.033 --> 02:04:41.179]  And that's why that metaphor that collapsing Miami condo, again, God bless those people, I'm not trying to belittle the event, but it's a metaphor.
[02:04:41.799 --> 02:04:47.540]  For what's happening in our society, and once the collapse begins, it accelerates at the speed of gravity.
[02:04:47.841 --> 02:04:49.061]  This can happen overnight.
[02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:50.781]  Overnight, the banks don't function.
[02:04:50.921 --> 02:04:52.062]  Overnight, no ATMs.
[02:04:52.342 --> 02:04:59.283]  Overnight, no more transactional capability in commercial sectors, including transportation, grocery, you know, anything.
[02:04:59.383 --> 02:05:01.324]  Fuel, refineries, everything.
[02:05:01.724 --> 02:05:06.025]  You can wake up next week, and the society you once knew is over.
[02:05:06.525 --> 02:05:12.691]  You've woken up in a futuristic, apocalyptic, post-nuclear, you know, scenario.
[02:05:12.871 --> 02:05:19.036]  Mike, you've got to join me again next week for, and I'm going to see you in over a year, I hope you come to the studio with us, to talk about solutions.
[02:05:19.056 --> 02:05:19.957]  Yeah, I haven't been there in a while.
[02:05:20.237 --> 02:05:30.306]  Yeah, solutions and what we do, because you're really, always do a great job, you're really hitting on all cylinders, right, and to talk about how do we, is there any way to stop this in 60 seconds?
[02:05:30.366 --> 02:05:32.408]  Is there, in your view, any way to stop this?
[02:05:33.783 --> 02:05:34.983]  Well, honestly, no.
[02:05:35.323 --> 02:05:38.664]  Not to stop it, but to recover on the other side and then achieve victory, yes.
[02:05:39.084 --> 02:05:40.865]  But I don't think we can stop what's been said in America.
[02:05:40.885 --> 02:05:43.385]  So the plane is crashing, but can it be a survivable crash?
[02:05:44.246 --> 02:05:45.726]  Well, absolutely.
[02:05:45.786 --> 02:05:45.946]  Right.
[02:05:45.986 --> 02:05:46.926]  The plane is crashing.
[02:05:47.026 --> 02:05:48.206]  Some of us have parachutes.
[02:05:48.947 --> 02:05:52.467]  And we can bail out of this plane and we can then rebuild after the crash.
[02:05:52.528 --> 02:05:53.528]  That's my assessment.
[02:05:55.188 --> 02:05:56.849]  Listen, I see the globalists.
[02:05:57.129 --> 02:05:57.829]  I see their leaders.
[02:05:57.849 --> 02:05:58.969]  They all look scared as hell.
[02:05:59.229 --> 02:06:00.029]  Because they're puppets.
[02:06:00.249 --> 02:06:01.690]  They know what's about to happen.
[02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:02.150]  They're scared.
[02:06:02.190 --> 02:06:02.590]  They should be.
[02:06:03.496 --> 02:06:04.677]  Yeah, they should be.
[02:06:05.578 --> 02:06:06.980]  Because they're going to be impacted by it, too.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.122]  And they're also destroying their own voter base, by the way.
[02:06:09.803 --> 02:06:13.167]  There would be mass murder across Democrats because of the spike protein.
[02:06:14.108 --> 02:06:17.551]  So, you know, the whole landscape is going to be changed from here forward.
[02:06:17.591 --> 02:06:19.514]  These are the last days of anything we recognize.
[02:06:20.955 --> 02:06:22.417]  The history once knew is over.
[02:06:23.786 --> 02:06:25.447]  We live to see the New World Order, Mike.
[02:06:25.527 --> 02:06:26.647]  We live to be in it, man.
[02:06:27.207 --> 02:06:28.308]  Wow, thank you so much.
[02:06:28.848 --> 02:06:29.268]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:06:29.288 --> 02:06:29.609]  Thank you.
[02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.010]  Nationalnews.com with Infowars.com.
[02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:35.531]  We'll do five more minutes and hand the baton to the guest host that's coming up.
[02:06:36.291 --> 02:06:37.052]  I'm sorry, folks.
[02:06:37.372 --> 02:06:38.652]  You just heard the truth, okay?
[02:06:39.013 --> 02:06:40.213]  Get right with Jesus right now.
[02:06:40.873 --> 02:06:45.135]  You know, that was the most powerful hour of radio, the most important I've ever done.
[02:06:45.155 --> 02:06:48.417]  And you know, next week I'll probably do something even more powerful.
[02:06:49.097 --> 02:06:51.238]  Because it's the times we all live in.
[02:06:53.117 --> 02:06:54.817]  We live in epic, insane times.
[02:06:55.058 --> 02:07:03.440]  Every instinct I've got is, get gasoline tanks in, get all your solar in, I've gotten part of it in, and just protect your family.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:06.641]  Because this is the takedown of civilization.
[02:07:07.041 --> 02:07:10.322]  They wouldn't launch a deadly bioweapon like this to the vaccine.
[02:07:10.342 --> 02:07:19.404]  I keep going back to this, because this is, I've studied warfare, I've studied the globalist, I've studied next-generational warfare that is even in textbooks, I've lived it and learned it.
[02:07:20.663 --> 02:07:24.744]  They don't hit you with something this deadly unless they got something 10 times worse about to happen.
[02:07:25.124 --> 02:07:26.525]  So they're going to get away with that attack.
[02:07:26.545 --> 02:07:27.005]  You understand?
[02:07:27.025 --> 02:07:29.885]  I mean, they wouldn't have done this.
[02:07:30.285 --> 02:07:34.086]  I mean, Bill Gates, all of them are going to go to Supermax prisons for what they've done.
[02:07:36.007 --> 02:07:38.728]  Except they're going to turn the damn power grid off.
[02:07:39.028 --> 02:07:41.888]  And even before Swab came out last week and said, we're going to turn your power off.
[02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:43.629]  What have I been saying for the last year?
[02:07:44.329 --> 02:07:46.010]  I know how the enemy is going to hit us.
[02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:47.530]  It's all I do is think about this stuff.
[02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:53.653]  And now the monster is up there just about to have an orgasm like, I've been followers.
[02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.214]  It will be nothing what you've seen.
[02:07:56.234 --> 02:08:01.316]  With the shutdown, the lockdown, this will destroy civilization.
[02:08:01.436 --> 02:08:02.677]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[02:08:02.997 --> 02:08:04.698]  I'm so sad for you.
[02:08:05.418 --> 02:08:12.442]  When he's busy constantly shooting his mouth off about how beautiful the lockdowns are and how nice it is to see you starving.
[02:08:17.128 --> 02:08:18.409]  And you're like, well, he'll never get away with it.
[02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:20.430]  He's a psychotic killer!
[02:08:22.011 --> 02:08:22.952]  He can't help it.
[02:08:23.172 --> 02:08:26.935]  You wonder, like, these pedophiles go grab kids out of backyards and rape them?
[02:08:26.955 --> 02:08:28.576]  You're like, you're gonna go to jail for that!
[02:08:28.796 --> 02:08:30.778]  They can't help themselves!
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:40.224]  And there's the sick part of me that sees the decadent liberals and the idiots and, oh, they're gonna love the collapse.
[02:08:40.465 --> 02:08:41.866]  They went along with this.
[02:08:42.878 --> 02:08:46.842]  They're going to be like army ants marching against us and organized as political weapons.
[02:08:46.862 --> 02:08:52.607]  Because they're not going to keep the collapse going too long, just enough to get them into a howling mob of crazies.
[02:08:54.689 --> 02:09:00.234]  And then it's going to start a giant flaming civil war, which I have no desire for.
[02:09:01.334 --> 02:09:04.858]  I've done everything I can to stop this.
[02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:21.240]  Once you initiate the stuff that the UN and Schwab and Gates have done, once you start things like this, you don't turn them off.
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:22.381]  You can't turn it off.
[02:09:25.305 --> 02:09:28.488]  Well, I'm sure army intelligence will stop them.
[02:09:28.508 --> 02:09:31.031]  You know, and all that delusional Q crap.
[02:09:33.715 --> 02:09:36.257]  The left is a cult of mindless idiots.
[02:09:36.817 --> 02:09:38.679]  They will do whatever they're told.
[02:09:38.939 --> 02:09:41.521]  They'll take their newborn babies in for deadly experimental injections.
[02:09:48.646 --> 02:09:54.150]  God has left us because we rejected God and God has lifted the hedge of protection.
[02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:59.234]  God will individually protect those of us to a certain extent if it's part of God's plan.
[02:10:00.895 --> 02:10:03.057]  I wouldn't blame God if he blew the whole damn planet up at this point.
[02:10:05.367 --> 02:10:06.248]  But that's not the plan.
[02:10:06.288 --> 02:10:06.948]  We already know the plan.
[02:10:07.369 --> 02:10:08.910]  We're going to get hurt bad.
[02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:10.411]  We're going to get chewed on by the New World Order.
[02:10:11.211 --> 02:10:14.534]  Satan's going to have a big old fun party raping the hell out of us.
[02:10:15.455 --> 02:10:17.276]  And so we can experience what those babies have gone through.
[02:10:17.316 --> 02:10:19.278]  And then it's all going to get cleaned up.
[02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.759]  But it's going to be rough, folks.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.922]  So you better get down on your knees and close to Jesus.
[02:10:27.443 --> 02:10:28.604]  And just get ready.
[02:10:30.605 --> 02:10:35.207]  And I'm a tough guy, but I don't know how to face something this satanic.
[02:10:36.148 --> 02:10:38.469]  I mean, I can feel it and I can see it.
[02:10:38.749 --> 02:10:41.050]  The time for us being on air is almost at an end.
[02:10:42.131 --> 02:10:43.712]  The time of us talking is almost over.
[02:10:44.512 --> 02:10:50.475]  And then we're all just going to be sucked under by the current, like we got grabbed by a riptide and you'd have to try to get up for air.
[02:10:51.576 --> 02:10:55.598]  We're about to just, the lights are about to go off, folks, figuratively and literally.
[02:10:58.524 --> 02:11:04.227]  We might have a month, we might have two years, but the enemy is committed under their God to kill people.
[02:11:05.628 --> 02:11:12.812]  And so I'm just telling you, get ready, get prepared and buy all the products you can at InfoWarsTore.com so I have a war chat as long as the bank works.
[02:11:13.272 --> 02:11:19.796]  Try to keep this place going and maybe give the crew a bonus so they can try to get ready because I'd give it about an 80% chance they're going to turn the lights out.
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:20.820]  All right.
[02:11:21.501 --> 02:11:21.861]  All right!
[02:11:21.901 --> 02:11:24.384]  We got a great guest host coming up in the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:11:24.424 --> 02:11:25.265]  Central, Lone Shroyer.
[02:11:25.966 --> 02:11:30.070]  Let's work hard so this horrible future doesn't happen, but right now, that's the course we're on.
[02:11:31.058 --> 02:11:34.241]  What a crazy, crazy week of information.
[02:11:34.321 --> 02:11:42.247]  Just, I mean, waterfalls of evidence, just the highest mountains of proof still being ignored by the mainstream media.
[02:11:42.267 --> 02:11:42.908]  What a crazy week.
[02:11:42.948 --> 02:11:44.469]  Happy Independence Day weekend, everybody.
[02:11:44.509 --> 02:11:47.752]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show final fourth hour here.
[02:11:47.812 --> 02:11:51.615]  My name is Stu Peters and you can find me at StuPeters.TV.
[02:11:51.675 --> 02:11:52.376]  I hope that you will.
[02:11:53.256 --> 02:11:54.497]  I promise you to never lie to you.
[02:11:54.537 --> 02:11:56.859]  I promise to always expose the truth no matter what it takes.
[02:11:56.879 --> 02:12:02.222]  You'll not find me on Twitter today, however, because of the exposure that I'm going to talk about shortly.
[02:12:02.242 --> 02:12:03.983]  The fact is this.
[02:12:04.203 --> 02:12:11.088]  The government, the globalists, the deep state cabal that wants you dead has a plan to put you inside of a bubble.
[02:12:11.849 --> 02:12:23.575]  Remember those bubbles that we talked about, the ones that we saw on the television, the ones that the mainstream media was just celebrating, the ones that they were trapping these young band students inside of when we were returning to normal, the new normal.
[02:12:24.396 --> 02:12:28.798]  And they had these band students literally playing their instruments in a bubble.
[02:12:29.718 --> 02:12:32.260]  Now imagine those bubbles, if you will, inside of your head.
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:32.800]  Just picture that.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.561]  This is what they're trying to do to your entire life.
[02:12:35.581 --> 02:12:38.483]  They're trying to do this to your financial existence.
[02:12:39.150 --> 02:12:46.997]  To your transportation, your ability to travel, your purchasing power, your faith, your freedom to speak, your social interaction.
[02:12:47.017 --> 02:12:50.761]  They want to put it all in one bubble so that they can harness all of this stuff, right?
[02:12:50.801 --> 02:12:54.925]  And there's one main power cord that runs to your bubble.
[02:12:55.545 --> 02:12:58.008]  Each person has their own bubble, their own identifier.
[02:12:58.949 --> 02:13:00.110]  It controls your health care.
[02:13:01.132 --> 02:13:02.253]  It controls everything about you.
[02:13:02.413 --> 02:13:03.894]  Every single thing about you.
[02:13:03.914 --> 02:13:05.815]  What you eat, where you shop, what you buy.
[02:13:06.416 --> 02:13:10.278]  All of these things are all in your bubble, identified with your number.
[02:13:10.298 --> 02:13:13.680]  There's this power cord, Ben, that runs to a switch.
[02:13:14.881 --> 02:13:21.946]  And there's, at the end of that switch, the fingers that are on that switch are those controlled by the deep state global cabal.
[02:13:22.326 --> 02:13:23.347]  The people that want you dead.
[02:13:24.187 --> 02:13:33.050]  The people that are trying to hide the fact that 82% of pregnant women that participated in a vaccine trial experienced spontaneous abortion, miscarriages, lost their babies.
[02:13:33.550 --> 02:13:35.190]  But they still want you to get this.
[02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:40.632]  They absolutely cannot stop now that this bioweapon has met some resistance.
[02:13:41.412 --> 02:13:42.973]  They have to force you to get it.
[02:13:43.733 --> 02:13:46.574]  I've talked to people inside of the military, very credible people.
[02:13:47.372 --> 02:13:54.957]  Who have told me absolutely unequivocally that the armed forces is going to mandate this for every single uniformed military personnel.
[02:13:56.098 --> 02:13:58.820]  Pilots are calling me, they're texting me, they're emailing me.
[02:14:00.341 --> 02:14:02.342]  Every single airline pilot is going to have this.
[02:14:02.862 --> 02:14:06.965]  These people don't care about your life because they have proven that they want you dead.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:15.784]  So they don't care if hundreds of planes are falling from the sky loaded with hundreds of people and you die in a fiery nose crash to the ground.
[02:14:15.824 --> 02:14:21.687]  They just don't care about people falling to their death and meeting their maker from 36 or 40,000 feet.
[02:14:21.727 --> 02:14:23.048]  They don't care about that.
[02:14:23.468 --> 02:14:24.428]  They want you quiet.
[02:14:24.468 --> 02:14:25.269]  They want you dead.
[02:14:27.478 --> 02:14:33.681]  So, a lot of people are saying to me today, when I mention this Twitter suspension, wow, we saw that coming.
[02:14:34.101 --> 02:14:36.482]  Well, of course, you know, of course you got banned from Twitter.
[02:14:36.522 --> 02:14:38.443]  But where did this acceptance come from?
[02:14:39.594 --> 02:14:42.035]  This acceptance is 100% poisonous.
[02:14:42.075 --> 02:14:44.495]  It's completely toxic to our very existence.
[02:14:45.035 --> 02:14:47.336]  We're not talking about the United States of America.
[02:14:47.736 --> 02:14:48.956]  We're not talking about Australia.
[02:14:48.976 --> 02:14:50.097]  We're not talking about the UK.
[02:14:50.117 --> 02:14:53.378]  We're not talking about China or any country exclusively.
[02:14:53.858 --> 02:14:54.278]  Canada.
[02:14:54.478 --> 02:14:55.678]  We're not talking about Canada.
[02:14:56.178 --> 02:14:58.539]  We are talking about a concerted global effort.
[02:14:58.599 --> 02:15:02.140]  And once you understand that, once you're able to wrap your head around the fact that
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:10.646]  We are so much more alike than we are different from every one of the people in every one of those countries that I mentioned where this broadcast is being transmitted to.
[02:15:12.268 --> 02:15:13.849]  We are all brothers and sisters.
[02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:18.793]  But that unity is destructive to the plan of the globalists.
[02:15:18.873 --> 02:15:25.097]  And imagine a billion people, just imagine a billion people in this world resisting this.
[02:15:26.398 --> 02:15:28.940]  We see what's happening to individuals who are resisting this.
[02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:29.681]  They're being targeted,
[02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:31.130]  They're being arrested.
[02:15:31.150 --> 02:15:31.910]  They're being jailed.
[02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:33.991]  They're being stripped of their right to speak freely.
[02:15:34.431 --> 02:15:36.451]  And it's not okay that I was deleted from Twitter.
[02:15:37.111 --> 02:15:39.312]  I don't care that Twitter is a crap platform.
[02:15:40.072 --> 02:15:44.753]  I don't care that we all recognize that they're funded by the same globalist cabal that wants you dead.
[02:15:44.793 --> 02:15:47.493]  I don't care that we have that knowledge.
[02:15:47.513 --> 02:15:47.973]  That's fine.
[02:15:48.013 --> 02:15:48.853]  Of course we all do.
[02:15:48.913 --> 02:15:50.134]  But it's not okay.
[02:15:51.074 --> 02:15:52.354]  They used that platform.
[02:15:52.514 --> 02:15:55.615]  They completely removed the President of the United States.
[02:15:55.675 --> 02:15:56.995]  It's kind of a big deal.
[02:15:58.872 --> 02:16:00.192]  Imagine living in those times.
[02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:03.133]  Imagine actually being here talking about something like that.
[02:16:03.173 --> 02:16:09.875]  If I would have mentioned this five years ago, you would have told me that I lost my mind, you would have Baker-acted me, and you would have had me force-medicated.
[02:16:10.315 --> 02:16:13.796]  You'd have had me kidnapped by the very people that are trying to kidnap us now.
[02:16:15.116 --> 02:16:26.879]  But those bubbles that the media was so happy to brag about, those bubbles that our kids were playing their instruments in, those bubbles will include everything about you, and that switch is controlled by the hand of the globalists.
[02:16:28.317 --> 02:16:49.979]  Completely unchecked, deep state communists that have absolutely toppled an entire political system, turned the United States of America, the world's last remaining superpower, completely upside down, tackled the West, stolen every right that you have, locked you down, cancelled out your vote, forced you into a muzzle, mandated a needle into your arm, burned down your cities,
[02:16:50.399 --> 02:16:55.400]  Taking your kids from you, cancelled your voice, stolen your liberty, crushed your freedom, shredded the Constitution.
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:04.783]  They have stripped you of your military protection and the protection that is supposed to be provided to you by your local county, state, and federal law enforcement agencies without firing a single shot.
[02:17:06.323 --> 02:17:17.366]  Not only do they not protect you, but those agencies that you have been raised to entrust with your safety and the safety of your property, the lives of your loved ones, has actually now been weaponized against you.
[02:17:17.386 --> 02:17:19.547]  The New Age Nazi brown shirts.
[02:17:20.578 --> 02:17:21.639]  I'm not overstating this.
[02:17:23.762 --> 02:17:29.069]  I want you to be perfectly clear about exactly what it is that I'm trying to state here.
[02:17:29.089 --> 02:17:30.190]  I want you to understand it.
[02:17:30.871 --> 02:17:33.114]  Any acceptance to this is absolute poison.
[02:17:35.837 --> 02:17:37.399]  So this whole, uh, we saw that coming.
[02:17:37.499 --> 02:17:38.460]  I'm not okay with that.
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:38.941]  Come on!
[02:17:40.174 --> 02:17:43.515]  Chris Sky is a Canadian patriot, but he's so much more than that.
[02:17:43.575 --> 02:17:54.077]  Like Alex Jones, like me, like Owen Schroer, like a handful of others, truthfully reporting and putting it all on the line, risking the very targeting that I was referencing.
[02:17:54.417 --> 02:17:55.597]  This isn't about one country.
[02:17:55.637 --> 02:17:57.198]  Like I said, this is about mankind.
[02:17:57.238 --> 02:17:58.918]  This is a real fight for humanity.
[02:17:59.358 --> 02:18:01.699]  And we're all so much more alike than we are different.
[02:18:02.139 --> 02:18:03.099]  I don't care where you're from.
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:07.823]  Realizing that this is a concerted effort is extremely important.
[02:18:07.963 --> 02:18:14.808]  Every single person on this planet is who they will demand subservience from, and if they don't get it, they will imprison you or kill you.
[02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:22.614]  Until you understand that, you're just living in an ignorant state of bliss, and that is the complacency that has gotten us to this point.
[02:18:24.956 --> 02:18:30.821]  Chris Sky is acting in Canada, but on behalf of every free person on the face of the planet, just like me.
[02:18:31.437 --> 02:18:41.859]  He's not surprised that he's being targeted, but I think it's important for us to illustrate just exactly how, and maybe most importantly, nobody has ever stopped me dead in my tracks.
[02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:45.120]  That bubble that I was talking about, that digital existence, if you will.
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:51.062]  Chris Sky, yesterday, blew me out of the water with how plainly he articulated this.
[02:18:51.502 --> 02:18:54.582]  How he simplified it so that anybody can understand.
[02:18:55.102 --> 02:18:57.283]  I'm convinced Howard Stern could understand.
[02:18:58.433 --> 02:19:02.215]  And we welcome Chris Sky for the rest of this segment, and we're going to hold him over for the next.
[02:19:02.275 --> 02:19:04.497]  Chris, there was a flyer that was sent out to the masses.
[02:19:04.537 --> 02:19:06.058]  A flyer about an event.
[02:19:06.138 --> 02:19:16.204]  Your name in bold letters, drawing from what I can tell, about 100,000 people to one place to hear you speak in front of the Supreme Court on Canada Day yesterday.
[02:19:16.944 --> 02:19:18.545]  That flyer, your name in bold.
[02:19:19.066 --> 02:19:20.006]  That was your event.
[02:19:20.467 --> 02:19:20.847]  Am I right?
[02:19:22.136 --> 02:19:27.277]  Well, I won't say it was my event, but I was definitely the main speaker for the event.
[02:19:27.417 --> 02:19:37.320]  And I was probably the main reason why the vast majority of people wanted to show up because I have been touring all around Canada and parts of the world speaking about exactly what you said.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.141]  This is about control.
[02:19:39.201 --> 02:19:40.501]  This isn't about our safety.
[02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:44.322]  And this is about bringing everybody together, uniting everybody.
[02:19:44.622 --> 02:19:48.543]  To get them to just say no to the agenda in general.
[02:19:48.603 --> 02:19:51.143]  The vaccines, the vaccine passports, and everything else.
[02:19:51.384 --> 02:19:52.904]  And that's what this event has been about.
[02:19:53.124 --> 02:19:56.085]  Last year in Ottawa on Canada Day, it was about the same thing.
[02:19:56.345 --> 02:20:00.266]  It was about unity and it was about getting people to say no to these draconian measures.
[02:20:00.586 --> 02:20:09.188]  Now all of a sudden, it got hijacked by a few politicians who made it about their own political interests and tried to prevent me from speaking at the event.
[02:20:09.388 --> 02:20:11.108]  So they used me to draw the people there
[02:20:11.508 --> 02:20:14.611]  Then when I got there, they tried to ostracize me, prevent me from speaking.
[02:20:14.891 --> 02:20:24.240]  When I told them I was just gonna ask the crowd if they wanted me to speak, they literally reported me to the RCMP to try to get me arrested so I wouldn't be able to speak.
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:26.702]  That didn't work, so they let me speak.
[02:20:27.083 --> 02:20:36.732]  Then they cut my mic off halfway through and got some children to start singing so they could make it look like I went on stage and tried to get these kids to stop singing so I could speak.
[02:20:37.176 --> 02:20:46.671]  In reality, this is setting another example of a patriot, a person that is standing up against the global cabal.
[02:20:46.992 --> 02:20:48.074]  And what I'm trying to explain
[02:20:48.607 --> 02:21:05.054]  Chris, is that this is not just about Canada, this is not just about the United States, and I'm really glad that you're here, I appreciate your time, I want you to stay here because we're going to go back with how you have been targeted and how every single person shouldn't say, well, this is in Canada, I don't really, this will never happen here, because you are absolutely dead wrong.
[02:21:05.134 --> 02:21:06.514]  Chris Sky will be with us when we come back.
[02:21:06.534 --> 02:21:07.314]  Stick around, go nowhere.
[02:21:07.635 --> 02:21:12.096]  You can find it right there, StuPeters.tv, breaking right at the top of the page, study 82%
[02:21:13.917 --> 02:21:18.158]  Of pregnant women that received the, quote, vaccine experienced miscarriage.
[02:21:18.178 --> 02:21:23.199]  This is the stuff that they will not be able to continue hiding from us, from the majority.
[02:21:23.259 --> 02:21:24.860]  We are the majority.
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:34.622]  Some are willing right now and have gone to the extent of losing their careers, losing their freedom, being locked up and risk losing their lives.
[02:21:34.782 --> 02:21:37.023]  One of those guys is here with us right now, Chris Sky.
[02:21:37.543 --> 02:21:40.785]  So it was a short segment there and I want to get right back into this.
[02:21:40.885 --> 02:21:41.746]  You have been arrested.
[02:21:41.846 --> 02:21:42.687]  You have been targeted.
[02:21:42.807 --> 02:21:46.229]  You have had warrants issued for your arrest by the Predictive Crime Unit.
[02:21:46.989 --> 02:21:50.552]  They have followed you around for events that didn't even happen, that you didn't even speak at.
[02:21:50.612 --> 02:21:52.153]  Now you're at this event on Canada Day.
[02:21:52.193 --> 02:21:52.813]  You go to speak.
[02:21:53.194 --> 02:21:55.235]  They cut your microphone not once but twice.
[02:21:55.675 --> 02:21:58.617]  They frame you on the internet as interrupting a children's choir.
[02:21:58.757 --> 02:22:00.218]  Absolutely, completely BS.
[02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:01.079]  Did not happen.
[02:22:01.599 --> 02:22:06.302]  And then you had to run again to flee and avoid arrest and prosecution.
[02:22:06.342 --> 02:22:07.243]  This is insane!
[02:22:11.224 --> 02:22:12.745]  It was and then it didn't stop there.
[02:22:12.845 --> 02:22:22.848]  After we were done we were just walking around the city trying to enjoy Canada Day and there was thousands and thousands of people out and we had about 30 police officers literally following us around everywhere we went like our own shadow.
[02:22:23.348 --> 02:22:24.588]  Like they expected us to do something.
[02:22:24.628 --> 02:22:25.369]  It was insane.
[02:22:25.389 --> 02:22:27.249]  It was only in Ottawa it was like that.
[02:22:27.269 --> 02:22:28.830]  The people here were very supportive.
[02:22:29.350 --> 02:22:30.130]  We were walking around
[02:22:30.629 --> 02:22:39.632]  Everybody everywhere was happy to see us so that the mood here was good and that's why they and that's the problem because they tried to hijack Canada Day.
[02:22:39.892 --> 02:22:46.013]  They literally tried to cancel Canada Day and make it about you're only allowed to celebrate Canada Day.
[02:22:46.253 --> 02:22:52.295]  If you're going to say the Canadians are horrible racist people that hate indigenous native people, which was absolutely ridiculous.
[02:22:52.495 --> 02:22:55.656]  They're trying to do the same thing in the United States with Independence Day.
[02:22:55.996 --> 02:23:02.625]  And the reason they're doing it is to try to destroy your national identity so they can further subjugate and control you.
[02:23:03.004 --> 02:23:10.026]  It's like you said, they want to turn, or like I said to you and you reiterated, they want to turn you into a blip on a screen that they can just turn off.
[02:23:10.226 --> 02:23:11.146]  And what do I mean by that?
[02:23:11.527 --> 02:23:19.149]  The vaccine passport took away your rights and freedoms and made them now government-granted privileges predicated on you taking a forced inoculation.
[02:23:19.589 --> 02:23:23.410]  Now they closed your business and took your job, so you're financially dependent on them.
[02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:29.072]  Now they want to do digital ID, digital currency, and merge that with your vaccine passport.
[02:23:29.872 --> 02:23:34.536]  At that point, they have complete control over every transaction you make.
[02:23:34.756 --> 02:23:46.845]  You won't even be able to sell your used shoes on eBay or another online website like Craigslist without them knowing what you're selling, having to get their permission, having them put it in the system, and having them take their piece of the pie.
[02:23:47.186 --> 02:23:51.549]  And that literally turns you into a little blip on a screen
[02:23:52.202 --> 02:24:08.682]  Where you were once an individual with rights and freedoms that could make a difference, that could make their own decisions, that had your own bodily and physical and mental autonomy, and now they have complete control over you to the point where they flip a switch and you're taken out of society.
[02:24:09.203 --> 02:24:10.385]  That's what they want.
[02:24:10.945 --> 02:24:20.510]  And they're further going to restrict your freedoms, your freedom of speech, your freedom of movement, your freedom to work, and they're going to erode your property rights.
[02:24:20.810 --> 02:24:25.273]  The next thing you're going to be hearing from these globalists is build back better.
[02:24:25.533 --> 02:24:28.895]  And it's not going to stop with lockdowns for viruses.
[02:24:28.935 --> 02:24:31.496]  The next thing we're going to have are climate lockdowns.
[02:24:31.736 --> 02:24:40.342]  They're going to start telling you that, oh, we need to curb human activity because we use too much electricity or too much fossil fuel or too much, we're causing too much carbon dioxide.
[02:24:40.362 --> 02:24:44.544]  And the only way to do that is have another lockdown because they got us used to these ideas of lockdowns.
[02:24:44.845 --> 02:24:53.790]  And as for these vaccines that we can't even call a vaccine because a vaccine by definition has to provide immunity and prevent transmission, which this does not do.
[02:24:54.191 --> 02:24:58.193]  They gave us this temporary lull in the virus because it's summertime.
[02:24:58.273 --> 02:24:59.174]  Flu season is over.
[02:24:59.614 --> 02:25:05.161]  And because all these people got vaccinated, they needed to dangle the carrot in front of their face, which was, okay, you can take off your mask.
[02:25:05.221 --> 02:25:06.862]  Okay, you can have a semblance of freedom.
[02:25:07.163 --> 02:25:08.424]  Except where I live in Ontario.
[02:25:08.664 --> 02:25:14.131]  In Ontario, Canada, we're still in the only province or state in entire North America
[02:25:14.551 --> 02:25:14.871]  We're good.
[02:25:37.370 --> 02:25:37.630]  Thank you.
[02:25:59.349 --> 02:26:02.790]  We're having some sort of a technical problem here, but what you're saying is
[02:26:26.943 --> 02:26:31.104]  Really highlighting to me in some of the most plain talk that I think I have ever heard.
[02:26:32.045 --> 02:26:32.965]  I think you need a show.
[02:26:34.325 --> 02:26:36.546]  Seriously, I'd love to have you on.
[02:26:36.586 --> 02:26:40.948]  I mean, I've really never heard anybody articulate this so plainly.
[02:26:41.448 --> 02:26:43.468]  And you do such a phenomenal job of doing that.
[02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:44.969]  Okay, so we've got about three minutes here.
[02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:45.989]  I want you to tell me this.
[02:26:46.649 --> 02:26:49.010]  What is we know the plan of the globalists?
[02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:51.151]  What is the plan of Chris Sky?
[02:26:51.271 --> 02:26:54.072]  How do we stop this from making this final turn?
[02:26:55.916 --> 02:26:58.458]  It's called United Non-Compliance.
[02:26:58.558 --> 02:27:02.961]  That's everybody coming together, regardless of all the ways they're trying to divide us.
[02:27:03.282 --> 02:27:09.426]  People scared of the virus, people who want to wear masks, people who are on government assistance, people who still have their jobs.
[02:27:09.847 --> 02:27:16.552]  People, they're trying to divide us with race, with age, with ethnicity, with people who have different political affiliations.
[02:27:16.792 --> 02:27:20.795]  Every single way they can, because the more they divide us, the smaller our voices.
[02:27:21.275 --> 02:27:33.383]  My term, United Non-Compliance, is everybody coming together regardless of any difference they can try to bring up for one cause, and that cause is the restoration of our rights and freedoms and saving our country.
[02:27:33.963 --> 02:27:37.326]  And that's where the slogan, Just Say No, comes from.
[02:27:37.586 --> 02:27:40.668]  And phase one of United Non-Compliance was the global awakening.
[02:27:40.988 --> 02:27:47.974]  And we spent a year waking up millions if not billions of people to the idea that this isn't about health and safety, this is about control.
[02:27:48.335 --> 02:27:52.058]  Phase two is 2021 and it's called taking action.
[02:27:52.258 --> 02:27:58.624]  And it's when we get the groups of protesters that we have and we give them actionable intent that they can do to make a difference.
[02:27:58.904 --> 02:28:02.267]  We have the small business owners banding together to make sure they can open.
[02:28:02.548 --> 02:28:07.032]  We have concerned parents attacking school boards to make sure their kids can be masked and restriction-free.
[02:28:07.512 --> 02:28:12.094]  We have employees coming together to go against mandatory vaccinations at their workplace.
[02:28:12.374 --> 02:28:17.476]  And lastly, we have concerned citizens that are going against the mask mandate.
[02:28:17.776 --> 02:28:19.017]  And to show how this can work...
[02:28:20.146 --> 02:28:22.169]  Like you said, they're targeting people like me.
[02:28:22.289 --> 02:28:23.711]  They're coming after us with everything they got.
[02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:31.081]  I went into a grocery store called Longo's without a mask, and it ended up with 40 police officers at my house without a warrant trying to kidnap me in the middle of the night.
[02:28:31.101 --> 02:28:34.145]  60 other people did the exact same thing as me.
[02:28:34.465 --> 02:28:37.089]  Unified, in non-compliance, and guess what?
[02:28:37.549 --> 02:28:43.855]  Not only did they not get arrested and sworn by the Gestapo, Longo, the story in question, was forced to change their policy.
[02:28:44.236 --> 02:28:47.859]  That's the power of united non-compliance, and that's how we get out of this.
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:58.190]  By stopping their agenda in its tracks, by just saying no to the vaccine, the vaccine passports, the business closures, and all the other restrictions, and forcing them back to our normal.
[02:28:58.490 --> 02:28:59.550]  Not their new normal.
[02:28:59.770 --> 02:29:02.111]  There is no such thing as a new normal.
[02:29:02.331 --> 02:29:04.992]  There's only normal and what they're trying to create.
[02:29:05.212 --> 02:29:12.734]  And what they're trying to create is a hell on earth for the average citizen and a totally technocratic medical control grid.
[02:29:13.134 --> 02:29:13.474]  Period.
[02:29:14.274 --> 02:29:14.715]  Absolutely, 100%.
[02:29:14.835 --> 02:29:17.375]  Chris Sky, God bless you, man.
[02:29:17.835 --> 02:29:22.277]  I really love, I enjoy talking to you and I'm happy and proud to be an ally of yours.
[02:29:22.497 --> 02:29:26.998]  Chris Sky, get his book, Just Say No, realchrissky.com, coming up in the next segment.
[02:29:27.558 --> 02:29:28.680]  Dr. Jane Ruby will be here.
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:32.123]  We're going to be talking about this phenomenon of magnetic food.
[02:29:32.844 --> 02:29:40.133]  She has uncovered some details that led directly to that Twitter suspension, and I believe myself being under electronic surveillance.
[02:29:40.153 --> 02:29:41.474]  Details coming up on the other side.
[02:29:42.295 --> 02:29:45.917]  They're trying to bury the Pfizer study where those kids had adverse events.
[02:29:45.997 --> 02:29:47.597]  Nearly 80% of them.
[02:29:48.078 --> 02:29:48.658]  It's out there.
[02:29:48.778 --> 02:29:49.638]  It's documented.
[02:29:50.359 --> 02:29:51.799]  Fact-checkers cannot dispute it.
[02:29:52.179 --> 02:29:57.762]  They tried to bury and hide 82% of inoculated pregnant women lost their babies.
[02:29:57.842 --> 02:29:58.842]  They tried to hide it.
[02:29:58.962 --> 02:29:59.463]  It's there.
[02:29:59.563 --> 02:30:00.803]  It's publicly discoverable.
[02:30:00.923 --> 02:30:01.463]  It's fact.
[02:30:01.523 --> 02:30:03.024]  It's at StuPeters.TV.
[02:30:03.504 --> 02:30:08.587]  They are trying to hide the connections about this magnetism phenomenon.
[02:30:08.987 --> 02:30:10.107]  It started in humans.
[02:30:10.167 --> 02:30:11.728]  Thousands of self-recorded videos.
[02:30:12.188 --> 02:30:17.050]  It's now in food, people showing, I mean, I'm literally recommending that you take a magnet to the supermarket.
[02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:19.751]  That sounds more tin hat than anything I can think of.
[02:30:20.651 --> 02:30:21.852]  And we honor those people.
[02:30:21.892 --> 02:30:23.792]  Listen, I will tell you this.
[02:30:25.533 --> 02:30:28.474]  How have we forgotten about the human aspect of all of this?
[02:30:29.734 --> 02:30:32.195]  How can you humanize something that you're seeing on paper?
[02:30:32.215 --> 02:30:33.476]  I'm going to do my best to try.
[02:30:34.456 --> 02:30:34.836]  There's ID 1261766-1.
[02:30:34.856 --> 02:30:35.356]  One years old.
[02:30:41.357 --> 02:30:45.338]  Died two days after vaccination, increased body temperature, seizure, death.
[02:30:46.839 --> 02:30:47.179]  There's ID 138-2906-1.
[02:30:47.219 --> 02:30:47.699]  15 years old.
[02:30:47.719 --> 02:30:48.159]  15 years old.
[02:30:48.179 --> 02:30:48.819]  Are you a mom?
[02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:49.259]  Are you a dad?
[02:30:49.279 --> 02:30:51.760]  Unexplained death within 48 hours.
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:53.121]  There's ID 138-6841-1.
[02:30:53.141 --> 02:30:53.381]  16 years old.
[02:30:53.401 --> 02:30:53.501]  Sweet 16.
[02:30:53.541 --> 02:30:55.561]  Just getting ready to get a driver's license.
[02:30:55.581 --> 02:30:56.342]  Whole life ahead of this kid.
[02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:17.988]  Prodrome of headache and gastric upset over two days following second dose, then felt fine.
[02:31:18.588 --> 02:31:21.370]  Found the following day dead in bed.
[02:31:22.832 --> 02:31:23.712]  Autopsy pending.
[02:31:26.274 --> 02:31:30.978]  Details for VAERS ID number 1406840-1.
[02:31:31.659 --> 02:31:32.139]  13 years old.
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:34.361]  Getting ready for high school.
[02:31:34.841 --> 02:31:37.203]  Excited about playing on the varsity basketball team.
[02:31:37.544 --> 02:31:38.284]  Playing football.
[02:31:38.905 --> 02:31:39.766]  First girlfriend.
[02:31:40.406 --> 02:31:41.327]  First job, maybe.
[02:31:43.672 --> 02:31:45.933]  Flu-like symptoms for two days, then found deceased.
[02:31:48.195 --> 02:31:51.857]  The list goes on and on and on and on.
[02:31:53.458 --> 02:31:54.859]  Dr. Jane Ruby joins us now.
[02:31:56.099 --> 02:32:00.942]  Dr. Jane, you brought the Spanish researcher's story to the forefront.
[02:32:01.382 --> 02:32:05.905]  More information that they tried to hide, but it's right out in the wide open.
[02:32:07.226 --> 02:32:10.548]  You brought it to InfoWars, you brought it to the Stu Peter Show,
[02:32:11.958 --> 02:32:15.041]  You've showed these side-by-side pictures of these.
[02:32:16.362 --> 02:32:17.863]  It's just, I mean, it's satanic looking.
[02:32:18.644 --> 02:32:24.909]  The question I have for you, Dr. Ruby, why is Pfizer not holding a press conference right now?
[02:32:28.612 --> 02:32:33.836]  Stu, the only thing I can think of is that they don't feel the need to, and that's very frightening.
[02:32:34.237 --> 02:32:36.679]  Let me bring you an update to the story.
[02:32:36.939 --> 02:32:40.602]  The report of these Spanish researchers
[02:32:41.334 --> 02:32:44.898]  From a group, they call themselves La Quinta Columna, the fifth column.
[02:32:45.519 --> 02:32:49.063]  The report is now out in English, thank God.
[02:32:49.563 --> 02:32:51.886]  And I got it yesterday, I've been studying it ever since.
[02:32:51.926 --> 02:32:53.728]  Let me boil it down for everybody.
[02:32:54.328 --> 02:33:02.818]  These researchers, in this group, got a vial, one vial, this is my understanding, I've looked at the methodology and what they've done.
[02:33:03.407 --> 02:33:17.514]  They got one vial that was sealed, verified, chain of custody of the Pfizer injection, whatever that is right now, and they put it under a regular microscope and they saw something very startling.
[02:33:18.614 --> 02:33:26.318]  It looked like paper folded under a liquid contrast, like Kleenex underneath paint, if you will.
[02:33:26.992 --> 02:33:34.326]  And one of their experts said, that looks a lot like a very toxic compound, graphene oxide.
[02:33:35.956 --> 02:33:38.998]  They got hold of an electron microscope.
[02:33:39.098 --> 02:33:46.201]  Before we go to these pictures for me to explain what they found, I have a picture that I've provided to the producers with an electron microscope.
[02:33:46.521 --> 02:33:59.568]  It fills half the room and to the right of that picture you'll see on one of the screens where they started to bring up at the nanometer level of magnification what was underneath that.
[02:33:59.628 --> 02:34:00.809]  Now what you're looking at here
[02:34:01.633 --> 02:34:04.295]  is a part of the electron microscope.
[02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:10.720]  This is an amazing instrument that magnifies millions, I shouldn't say millions, thousands of times.
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.181]  I'm not a microscopy expert.
[02:34:12.521 --> 02:34:19.386]  I just know that I love electron microscopy because it gets right down to the cellular and then beneath into the molecular level.
[02:34:20.567 --> 02:34:23.489]  If you can bring back the picture that we had with the side-by-side
[02:34:24.008 --> 02:34:26.689]  What they found blew them away, Stu.
[02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:33.990]  They had a picture, what you will see on your left, is from the Pfizer vial.
[02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:44.412]  What you are seeing on your, and that's highlighted in green, the RD1 sample, that's 99%, they say, of what was inside the vial.
[02:34:44.953 --> 02:34:51.134]  They did extract some RNA material, but the majority of that vial was what you see on the left.
[02:34:51.707 --> 02:34:58.973]  What you're seeing on the right, at 200 nanometers, just for a point of reference, Choucair et al.
[02:34:58.993 --> 02:35:10.503]  2009, was a publication that was using graphene oxide, and they gave their electron microscope picture of it.
[02:35:10.783 --> 02:35:16.087]  So when they matched them up, they basically said, look, this is not 100% conclusive.
[02:35:16.127 --> 02:35:17.749]  We have more studies we need to do.
[02:35:19.016 --> 02:35:31.083]  But undeniably to the experts in the room, this vial from Pfizer, once they got it under the electron microscope, does look very clearly like real graphene oxide.
[02:35:31.463 --> 02:35:42.990]  And the shocking part is they point out that, if you look on the right, you can see a better version of this black shear mesh that sort of entwines these globules, these horrible looking globules.
[02:35:43.430 --> 02:35:46.632]  And it is also on the left in the Pfizer vial sample.
[02:35:47.282 --> 02:35:50.805]  And they say that that is part and parcel of the toxicity.
[02:35:52.107 --> 02:36:00.415]  So what they've said here at the end, Stu, to me, every time I see this image, I get very, very upset.
[02:36:00.495 --> 02:36:08.242]  Their conclusion was that this sample presents a high similarity with images of graphene oxide
[02:36:08.635 --> 02:36:17.321]  from the literature, obtained from the same TEM technique, electron microscopy, with similar magnifications.
[02:36:17.861 --> 02:36:29.908]  And they call that black shear junk that's around these globules, an intricate matrix or mesh of folded, translucent, flexible sheets can be observed.
[02:36:30.249 --> 02:36:35.372]  And there's a study out, Stu, very, very recent, that cites the
[02:36:36.042 --> 02:36:46.071]  Um, the propensity, if you will, of graphene oxide to cause blood clotting, platelet disruption, platelet explosion, if you will.
[02:36:47.073 --> 02:36:49.095]  In vivo, in animals.
[02:36:49.595 --> 02:36:52.057]  So I'm very, very concerned about this.
[02:36:52.457 --> 02:36:58.781]  This is probably what's part of this, you know, explosion, if you will, of thrombotic episodes.
[02:36:59.121 --> 02:37:04.485]  People having blood clots, people just dropping dead of strokes when the clots break off.
[02:37:06.186 --> 02:37:09.428]  Is graphene oxide something that you're supposed to put in your body?
[02:37:11.505 --> 02:37:26.269]  No, Stu, and there are a lot of studies that I've been digging through that reflect previous research with animals and in the lab with non-biological tissues, things like that, for industrial use.
[02:37:26.349 --> 02:37:38.833]  And there's warning after warning that more research needs to be done to see if this could be safely used or even diluted down and safely used in therapies and treatments.
[02:37:39.524 --> 02:37:46.191]  And Stu, I'm going to say something that I think is really shocking, but when you look at all this, it looks like they're doing the experiment now.
[02:37:48.153 --> 02:37:58.064]  Well, you know, I mean, we released tapes of a Moderna spokesperson that was caught on the phone specifically saying every single person who takes this jab is part of a trial.
[02:37:58.164 --> 02:38:00.867]  And, you know, for the most part, we knew that.
[02:38:01.656 --> 02:38:10.899]  But it's really shocking to hear that from a spokesperson from the company that is profiting billions and billions and billions of dollars lobbying for boosters.
[02:38:11.659 --> 02:38:17.701]  We have now learned that pilots, not only are they all required to get jabbed,
[02:38:18.368 --> 02:38:29.271]  But these pilots are now being subjected to international, other countries, health mandates as it comes to masking, as it comes to these injections.
[02:38:29.551 --> 02:38:39.154]  What that means is that if country A says you have to have all of your boosters in order to be on that flight, in order to captain that aircraft,
[02:38:39.734 --> 02:38:53.785]  No matter if you work for a company there or if you work for a company here in the United States, United, American, Delta, any of the above, you will be required to follow the laws or mandates of these other countries, third world countries included.
[02:38:54.285 --> 02:38:57.788]  They are going to booster every single one of these pilots.
[02:38:57.848 --> 02:39:00.690]  Now, briefly, before I had Chris Sky on, I mentioned
[02:39:01.170 --> 02:39:08.932]  These globalists do not care if there are planes loaded with hundreds of people falling from the sky, which is truly where we are heading.
[02:39:09.052 --> 02:39:10.772]  It's a miracle that we are not there now.
[02:39:11.332 --> 02:39:13.013]  Cancelled on Twitter, I mean, that's fine.
[02:39:14.033 --> 02:39:16.114]  Under surveillance, that's expected.
[02:39:16.954 --> 02:39:20.355]  Tucker Carlson acknowledged that he has reason to believe that he's under surveillance.
[02:39:20.375 --> 02:39:22.395]  This is what happens to truth tellers.
[02:39:23.875 --> 02:39:24.796]  Alex knows all about it.
[02:39:25.316 --> 02:39:26.416]  They were going to try to set him up.
[02:39:27.913 --> 02:39:29.734]  Inside information breaking all over the place.
[02:39:29.754 --> 02:39:31.415]  I'm sure it's been covered here on InfoWars.
[02:39:31.435 --> 02:39:33.756]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, final and fourth hour here.
[02:39:33.796 --> 02:39:34.557]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:39:34.597 --> 02:39:36.277]  Please come and find me at StuPeters.TV.
[02:39:36.317 --> 02:39:42.961]  We're joined by Dr. Jane Ruby, who has been one of the most brave experts in this field.
[02:39:42.981 --> 02:39:45.962]  20 years of pharmaceutical research experience.
[02:39:46.183 --> 02:39:47.903]  You can find her at DrJaneRuby.com.
[02:39:48.544 --> 02:39:51.565]  She has now kind of become a medical investigator.
[02:39:52.226 --> 02:39:53.747]  That's what's happening here.
[02:39:55.416 --> 02:39:56.617]  It's insane what's going on.
[02:39:57.217 --> 02:40:04.022]  The VAERS numbers that I mentioned, there's another system that's available, which we're going to get to in a minute, but I want to continue this deal on these pilots.
[02:40:05.003 --> 02:40:09.946]  This is, although the fact checkers say that it's false, that this is a horrific phenomenon.
[02:40:10.927 --> 02:40:21.354]  I don't know about you, but I hope that they have unvaxxed pilots sitting in coach, ready to fly these planes, ready to land them in the event that at 46,000 feet, these pilots are meeting their maker.
[02:40:22.254 --> 02:40:24.476]  Is it just by sheer luck?
[02:40:25.146 --> 02:40:28.229]  Or by the blessing of God that we have not seen this yet?
[02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:30.292]  Are these pilots a ticking time bomb?
[02:40:32.474 --> 02:40:45.548]  Well, the frightening thing is, to me, that while the airlines are putting out messaging, public messages, to tell the flying public to avoid flying if they've received one of these injections,
[02:40:46.035 --> 02:41:03.728]  They're behind the scenes creating incentives and getting close to a deadline where they claim they're going to mandate 100% of the pilots, flight attendants, and the FAA, I guess, they're going to get them involved in something about getting all the control tower people injected.
[02:41:03.768 --> 02:41:06.710]  So, I don't understand how they reconcile that with themselves.
[02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:08.311]  But let me tell you a quick story, Stu.
[02:41:09.231 --> 02:41:11.093]  As you mentioned at the top of the hour,
[02:41:12.193 --> 02:41:14.914]  There are pilots that are coming out of the woodwork.
[02:41:15.314 --> 02:41:19.155]  They're trying to tell us their internal struggle and how bad it is.
[02:41:19.636 --> 02:41:21.596]  There's one in particular that reached out to me.
[02:41:21.696 --> 02:41:27.958]  I'm going to actually be connecting him with you because hopefully he'll be on your show and he can tell more of the story.
[02:41:27.998 --> 02:41:30.259]  But basically what he's doing is he's trying to buy time.
[02:41:30.279 --> 02:41:32.439]  He's trying to avoid getting one of these shots.
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:34.280]  And he wrote to his leadership.
[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:40.562]  The union, by the way, is in total lockstep with every company.
[02:41:41.055 --> 02:41:48.957]  You know, the Airline Pilots Association of America is actually supposed to be representing these pilots.
[02:41:49.137 --> 02:41:52.238]  They are in lockstep with all of the American carriers.
[02:41:52.758 --> 02:41:58.120]  And this particular pilot said that he pleaded with his leadership and said, look, you know, this is not my choice.
[02:41:58.700 --> 02:41:59.640]  There are too many risks.
[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:00.820]  This is experimental.
[02:42:01.161 --> 02:42:08.263]  And because it's experimental, it goes against the Nuremberg Codes that came out of, you know, of the trials.
[02:42:08.863 --> 02:42:09.663]  And he was
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:13.461]  He got such backlash, he was called an anti-Semite.
[02:42:13.821 --> 02:42:22.724]  How dare he bring in the Nuremberg trials, as if the only people that were injured in the Nuremberg trials were Jews.
[02:42:22.924 --> 02:42:37.269]  And this leadership said, I'm going to share some of this, the leadership wrote back and snapped and said, I stand with the rest of the Jewish members of our group here, our union group, in taking offense to your comparison.
[02:42:37.802 --> 02:42:46.168]  And so the pilot wrote back and said, you know, or one of the other reps wrote back and said, look, the Nuremberg Code is about that medical experiments should be voluntary.
[02:42:46.508 --> 02:42:48.009]  And here's what he wrote back, Stu.
[02:42:48.289 --> 02:42:54.854]  And this is going to give you all an idea of what pilots and flight attendants are struggling with behind the scenes right now.
[02:42:54.914 --> 02:42:57.035]  This leader, who is a chairman, this is
[02:42:58.399 --> 02:43:00.801]  I was given permission to use his name from this email.
[02:43:00.841 --> 02:43:13.451]  Captain Todd Insler is a chairman for the Union, for one of the airlines, and he said, please let this pilot know it's wholly inappropriate to compare Nuremberg to voluntary COVID vaccinations.
[02:43:13.912 --> 02:43:14.132]  What?
[02:43:15.153 --> 02:43:26.402]  When we round them up, seize their belongings and put them in trains to work camps and tattoo them with ID numbers and shave their heads, make them wear prison clothes, then he can bring up Nuremberg.
[02:43:26.422 --> 02:43:27.823]  And here's how he closes, Stu.
[02:43:28.604 --> 02:43:37.406]  Until then, he can go get a effing shot and collect $4,000 or he can STFU.
[02:43:37.886 --> 02:43:39.767]  His comments are more than offensive.
[02:43:42.587 --> 02:43:43.408]  I don't know what to say.
[02:43:43.948 --> 02:43:49.389]  We're being told that pilots are not being mandated to take this job.
[02:43:49.629 --> 02:43:51.550]  They are out and out lying.
[02:43:52.010 --> 02:43:52.590]  We know that.
[02:43:53.402 --> 02:43:59.104]  I have inside information from a Delta flight attendant who differentiated flight attendants from pilots.
[02:43:59.564 --> 02:44:03.426]  The reason being is because pilots are part of the union at this point in time.
[02:44:03.966 --> 02:44:06.547]  The flight attendants are not a part of the union.
[02:44:07.547 --> 02:44:11.489]  That flight attendant can unequivocally provide documentation and will.
[02:44:11.649 --> 02:44:12.869]  It's been received in my email.
[02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:16.991]  I have to redact some of this stuff, but I can tell you 100% that I have seen it.
[02:44:17.651 --> 02:44:20.172]  I've seen proof that Delta Airlines is
[02:44:21.101 --> 02:44:23.044]  Force vaccinating all of their pilots.
[02:44:23.084 --> 02:44:25.106]  If you don't take it, you're out of here.
[02:44:25.507 --> 02:44:27.149]  And Stu, I want to point something out.
[02:44:27.409 --> 02:44:30.914]  We just put up, the producers just put up a great picture of an article.
[02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:36.073]  Where the airlines are telling their pilots not to fly for two weeks after the jab.
[02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:40.135]  I'd like to respectfully ask, upon what science is that based?
[02:44:40.435 --> 02:44:41.696]  How do you know it's two weeks?
[02:44:42.096 --> 02:44:43.317]  How do you know it's four weeks?
[02:44:43.597 --> 02:44:45.498]  How do you know it should be anything at all?
[02:44:45.898 --> 02:44:47.459]  I'd like to know what that's based on.
[02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:49.901]  This stuff just gets plucked out of the air, Stu.
[02:44:50.201 --> 02:44:52.482]  And all of a sudden, there's a policy based on it.
[02:44:52.762 --> 02:44:53.963]  This is very dangerous.
[02:44:54.343 --> 02:44:56.925]  We have our children are flying public on airplanes.
[02:44:57.626 --> 02:44:58.927]  It's got to be investigated.
[02:44:59.227 --> 02:45:02.191]  And yes, why isn't Pfizer having a press conference?
[02:45:02.431 --> 02:45:04.914]  Why isn't United Airlines having a press conference?
[02:45:05.174 --> 02:45:06.155]  Why isn't American?
[02:45:06.455 --> 02:45:11.301]  I don't know, Stu, maybe because they feel like they've got enough cover and they don't have to defend themselves publicly.
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:17.722]  Well, what I will say is that the information that we're bringing to light is right out in the wide open.
[02:45:17.822 --> 02:45:29.447]  The graphene flagship, if you want to look these people up, the graphene flagship, I'm going to say it again, these people at the graphene flagship need to be investigated.
[02:45:29.527 --> 02:45:38.691]  Now, these are the very people that are telling you that graphene, graphene oxide, can play a role in helping to calm your anxiety.
[02:45:39.291 --> 02:45:48.593]  Now, at the same time that is happening, that that is being released, we hear in America those that are being subjected to the fear-mongering of the mainstream media.
[02:45:49.053 --> 02:45:51.094]  We're seeing these people with masks on.
[02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:55.515]  We're seeing people in scrubs and in lab coats telling you, you have to go get this thing.
[02:45:55.975 --> 02:46:01.696]  Your research can no longer be, obviously, we have come to the conclusion, asking your doctor because your doctor has no idea.
[02:46:02.316 --> 02:46:04.437]  To your point, why aren't they having a press conference?
[02:46:04.537 --> 02:46:06.778]  How are they coming up with this timeline for the airlines?
[02:46:06.798 --> 02:46:07.938]  This timeline for the pilots?
[02:46:07.958 --> 02:46:08.378]  Two weeks?
[02:46:08.418 --> 02:46:08.579]  This?
[02:46:08.839 --> 02:46:10.419]  And these are arbitrary numbers.
[02:46:10.459 --> 02:46:11.080]  They don't know.
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:12.600]  The fact is, nobody knows.
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:14.341]  Nobody in a lab coat knows.
[02:46:14.741 --> 02:46:16.862]  None of the pharmacists that are injecting this stuff knows.
[02:46:16.902 --> 02:46:21.143]  And they don't know because, as we have previously talked about, the leaflets are blank in these things.
[02:46:21.323 --> 02:46:22.504]  The inserts are blank.
[02:46:22.664 --> 02:46:22.504]  100%.
[02:46:22.724 --> 02:46:24.205]  No info.
[02:46:24.285 --> 02:46:28.286]  Intentionally left blank are the only words that are on the inside of these things.
[02:46:29.327 --> 02:46:30.067]  We have proven
[02:46:30.825 --> 02:46:34.609]  The theory of this magnetism just by a virtue.
[02:46:34.829 --> 02:46:36.611]  People sticking magnetic stuff to them.
[02:46:36.651 --> 02:46:39.174]  Metal objects are not supposed to stick to human beings.
[02:46:39.494 --> 02:46:41.056]  It doesn't matter what a fact checker says.
[02:46:41.636 --> 02:46:44.579]  Metal objects are not supposed to stick to poultry, fish, or meat.
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:46.922]  You will no longer be eating real meat.
[02:46:47.518 --> 02:46:50.940]  This is all a part of the plan to scare you away from beef.
[02:46:51.481 --> 02:46:57.605]  It's not a coincidence that this is coming out at the same time that they're trying to push this Green New Deal, which, by the way, would get rid of your cows.
[02:46:58.266 --> 02:47:10.154]  It's not a coincidence that while they're talking about trillions of dollars in infrastructure bills that they're trying to ram down the throat of the taxpayer, and whether you like it or not, they're going to do it because they've already proven that your vote doesn't count, your voice doesn't matter.
[02:47:10.914 --> 02:47:13.136]  And while they're talking about this infrastructure thing,
[02:47:14.211 --> 02:47:15.132]  Buildings are falling.
[02:47:15.532 --> 02:47:16.612]  Bridges are failing.
[02:47:17.073 --> 02:47:19.954]  And this is all happening, surprisingly, at one time.
[02:47:20.434 --> 02:47:33.380]  At the very same time that they're talking about a gun control problem and gun violence is breaking out all over America is the same exact time that you see the defunding of police departments and a mass exodus of good cops that are there to take care of you and me.
[02:47:33.981 --> 02:47:37.883]  At the same time that they're talking about all of this, it's all happening at one time.
[02:47:39.083 --> 02:47:40.644]  Joe Biden is a Trojan horse.
[02:47:41.923 --> 02:47:45.666]  Joe Biden will sign absolutely anything that they put in front of him.
[02:47:46.706 --> 02:47:52.390]  And the reason that they will do that is so that by virtue, Kamala Harris looks like the voice of moderation.
[02:47:53.591 --> 02:47:54.131]  Imagine that.
[02:47:54.551 --> 02:48:03.737]  Imagine the most cynical, the most extremist, radical senator that has ever occupied a seat in that building.
[02:48:04.278 --> 02:48:08.941]  Her name is Kamala Harris, who is now supposedly, allegedly the vice president
[02:48:10.288 --> 02:48:15.572]  Is looming over Joe Biden, waiting for that gun legislation to get passed.
[02:48:15.732 --> 02:48:28.181]  Very strict gun legislation that will either take your guns from you or will significantly restrict who can buy them, what your magazine capacity is, what type of gun you can own, thereby pretty much eliminating any self-defense that you would have whatsoever.
[02:48:29.421 --> 02:48:38.688]  When that passes, it is my prediction that that is when she will force him out or he will bow out due to some medical issue, some unforeseen medical issue.
[02:48:39.921 --> 02:48:48.847]  And then, this person, the most radical senator that you have ever known in the history of our country, will look like a voice of moderation.
[02:48:49.427 --> 02:48:51.068]  None of this is by accident.
[02:48:52.109 --> 02:48:53.550]  Dr. Ruby, thank you so much for being here.
[02:48:53.570 --> 02:48:56.772]  I can't tell you how much we appreciate your insight, and please continue to follow up on this.
[02:48:56.812 --> 02:49:02.836]  If you want to reach Dr. Jane Ruby, you can hit her up in her secure and encrypted email, drjanerubyatprotonmail.com.
[02:49:02.856 --> 02:49:04.117]  Thanks again, we really appreciate it.
[02:49:04.777 --> 02:49:07.179]  When I come back here next week, I am going to have
[02:49:08.381 --> 02:49:19.608]  Redacted evidence from whistleblowers, not only inside of these airlines, flight attendants, pilots, testimony, on the record, recorded, military personnel.
[02:49:19.708 --> 02:49:28.354]  Last night, I received a phone call from a person inside of active duty military who has security clearances, knows what the plan is there.
[02:49:28.654 --> 02:49:31.736]  We're not ready to go with it, but I'm telling you, it looks absolutely horrific.
[02:49:33.192 --> 02:49:34.393]  Stay blessed in your faith.
[02:49:34.513 --> 02:49:35.894]  Stay strong with God.
[02:49:36.094 --> 02:49:37.235]  Unite with one another.
[02:49:37.656 --> 02:49:39.717]  Please have a great Independence Day weekend.
[02:49:39.817 --> 02:49:40.618]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:49:44.241 --> 02:49:53.208]  InfoWars has proven that we know what we're talking about and that we are a major game-changing organization for a pro-human future.
[02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:59.994]  And I really appreciate the listeners in the last 27 years that have helped me stay on the air.
[02:50:00.754 --> 02:50:06.918]  But now more than ever, being one of the only independent media organizations on the planet that actually understands what we're facing.
[02:50:07.478 --> 02:50:18.725]  And now as our prominence and now as people's respect for us really grows to all-time highs, it's more important now than ever that we stay on air to continue to challenge the globalist plague.
[02:50:18.925 --> 02:50:20.967]  Our mission now is more important than ever.
[02:50:21.107 --> 02:50:26.572]  Our importance is more central than ever, and that means your importance, and the guests, and the family that is InfoWars.
[02:50:26.672 --> 02:50:29.394]  So, I want to thank the listeners for their support and their prayers.
[02:50:29.554 --> 02:50:38.862]  But because of the lockdowns of the last year and the supply chain breakdowns, because we sell high-quality supplements as one of our main funding mechanisms, we're unable to get a lot of these products in.
[02:50:39.043 --> 02:50:43.947]  So, we've got to substitute some of those sales with t-shirt sales, and water filter sales, and durable food sales.
[02:50:44.087 --> 02:50:44.207]  It's
[02:50:59.650 --> 02:51:00.190]  We're good to go.
[02:51:18.302 --> 02:51:23.904]  If you go to the front page of InfoWarsTore.com, right there in the middle, you can see where it says, Become a Sponsor, because that's what it is.
[02:51:24.084 --> 02:51:29.226]  Give a gift, a one-time gift, sign up for recurring gifts, $5, $10, $20, $100 a month.
[02:51:29.306 --> 02:51:40.571]  We really need that, because that is 95% of the money coming in from a donation actually funds us, instead of a product where maybe we make 30, 40% on it, when it's on sale sometimes, even less.
[02:51:40.811 --> 02:51:41.212]  We're good to go.
[02:51:57.153 --> 02:51:57.373]  I think?
[02:52:19.195 --> 02:52:19.375]  It's
[02:52:34.172 --> 02:52:35.793]  Get your privacy pockets for your cell phone.
[02:52:35.833 --> 02:52:36.333]  Get your books.
[02:52:36.373 --> 02:52:36.973]  Get your films.
[02:52:36.993 --> 02:52:38.373]  Get your non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:52:38.413 --> 02:52:39.294]  Get your shortwave radios.
[02:52:39.334 --> 02:52:44.175]  Whatever you do, shop with InfoWarStore.com and help not just keep us on air, but I want to expand.
[02:52:44.535 --> 02:52:45.656]  And we can't do it without you.
[02:52:45.716 --> 02:52:47.516]  So please, help keep us in the black.
[02:52:47.876 --> 02:52:49.497]  Help keep us out at the tip of the spear.
[02:52:49.817 --> 02:52:52.338]  Because when you finance us, it's like buying war bonds.
[02:52:52.678 --> 02:52:57.639]  You literally are funding the organization that Brian Stelter and George Soros and others completely hate.
[02:52:57.779 --> 02:52:58.800]  So please, keep us on air.
[02:52:58.860 --> 02:52:59.780]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:53:03.393 --> 02:53:04.481]  It's Cold War!
