[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:01.310]  What have we been talking about?
[00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:09.654]  Psaki and Biden and Trudeau and Australia and all of them saying, we're coming to forcibly inject you.
[00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:13.857]  We forcibly injected a bunch of school kids without their parents' consent and we don't care.
[00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:15.377]  I played that clip last hour.
[00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:19.700]  And we've got strike forces.
[00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:30.696]  That are coming to your door to give you this shot that's experimental and they had to put an insert on saying it causes heart attacks.
[00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:33.497]  But you're crazy if you don't take it and you're gonna take it!
[00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:36.658]  But they got a gun to their head to make you take it.
[00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:39.899]  And then we get this.
[00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.681]  This bill is heavily sponsored by AOC, all of them.
[00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:46.316]  On the Energy and Commerce Committee?
[00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.017]  I know you're probably looking at that as a TV viewer.
[00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:53.800]  Radio listeners can't see the bill, but let me give them the number.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.964]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. 666.
[00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:09.767]  Yep, you heard me right.
[00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:14.349]  Heavily sponsored, officially by the Democrats, in the new Congress, H.R.
[00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:14.349]  666.
[00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:24.233]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:27.314 --> 00:01:29.455]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:31.775]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:41.782]  I told you that you would see about a month ago on air public declarations on TV that we're coming to have sex with your children.
[00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:49.507]  In the Old Testament it talks about Sodom and Gomorrah and they come to the door and give us your women, your men, your children.
[00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.109]  We're having sex with them, a big gang of rapists.
[00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.390]  Well, you could say that's fiction if you want, but it's happening again.
[00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.660]  And now the San Francisco Orchestra, the San Francisco Choir, is, quote, gay now, which really means pedophilia.
[00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:09.225]  And they've come out and said, we're recruiting your children.
[00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:09.805]  We're coming.
[00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:10.747]  We're going to get them.
[00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:12.128]  We're coming for them!
[00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:13.710]  Well, we already know that.
[00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:19.894]  And this is the revolution of vampirism, of sucking the energy out of the innocents.
[00:02:20.415 --> 00:02:24.357]  They put it up on YouTube, got 99% downvotes, they pulled it but we saved it.
[00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:27.339]  Here they are with their declaration of war on our children!
[00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.416]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:41.421]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:46.986]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:50.329]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.454]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:57.935]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:02:57.955 --> 00:02:59.796]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:05.339]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate.
[00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.660]  We'll convert your children.
[00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.802]  Someone's gotta teach them not to hate.
[00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:15.705]  We're coming for them.
[00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:18.826]  We're coming for your children.
[00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.001]  We're good.
[00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:10.305]  Look how weak and pathetic and, like, soulful all those men look.
[00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:21.969]  Ranged on chemicals, totally fried, and now all they want is, like, zombies want brains?
[00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.531]  As an archetype because they don't have them?
[00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:30.553]  Well, they want the innocence of children.
[00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:31.773]  We'll convert your children.
[00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:32.914]  It's a religion, like Islam.
[00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.520]  Because we bow to it.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.140]  These are men.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:48.843]  They're going to recruit your children and have a relationship with them and convert them.
[00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:53.385]  It's not the gay San Francisco choir, it's the pedophile.
[00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:55.726]  Promoting LGBTP.
[00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:11.382]  And the corporate takeover And death camps in China Wrapped in Tim Cook's yellow flag
[00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:23.421]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:32.484]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender, in 2008.
[00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:33.464]  Oh really?
[00:05:33.484 --> 00:05:34.144]  It's not a woman?
[00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:34.884]  It's a man or something?
[00:05:34.904 --> 00:05:35.725]  A woman raping kids?
[00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:36.345]  Who would have thought?
[00:05:36.885 --> 00:05:39.926]  There is a unified globalist operation.
[00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.091]  They want our children.
[00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.132]  They want our wives.
[00:05:43.172 --> 00:05:44.152]  They want our husbands.
[00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:45.614]  They want our parents.
[00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:46.774]  They want us dead.
[00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:55.501]  But not before they ceremonially rape us genetically, financially, spiritually, culturally.
[00:05:56.642 --> 00:05:57.983]  This is all about conquest.
[00:05:58.063 --> 00:05:59.024]  It's all about dominance.
[00:05:59.064 --> 00:06:00.665]  It's all about power.
[00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:08.992]  You have the Bilderberg Group Davos meeting of Big Tech meeting in Idaho under armed guards and paramilitary forces.
[00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:10.393]  And on the main agenda is
[00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.431]  The Gay Agenda for Children!
[00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:19.432]  They actually say, Teaching Tolerance, L-G-B-T-P.
[00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:40.280]  And now, the San Francisco Orchestra, the San Francisco Men's Choir, the Pedophile Choir, has said, we will corrupt your kids, close quote, we will recruit them, we will take them over, they are ours, we are quote, coming for them.
[00:06:42.008 --> 00:07:01.881]  These are quotes, but hey, I've got the head of the UN Global Rapid Response Force, Dr. Ryan, saying a year ago that once they phase in lockdowns, they'll become permanent for any new flu or cold, and that they're gonna go into our homes and take the children and others to isolation centers.
[00:07:02.142 --> 00:07:05.144]  And he starts licking his lips.
[00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.086]  The children are the target.
[00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:11.923]  They illegally injected entire schools in Australia.
[00:07:11.943 --> 00:07:14.944]  The health minister said, screw you, big deal, get over it.
[00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:16.024]  I've got that video coming up.
[00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:23.347]  We have in New Zealand, where it's a global system just like in Canada, saying, we will hunt you down if you don't take your shots.
[00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:24.187]  We will arrest you.
[00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:25.428]  That's coming up.
[00:07:25.468 --> 00:07:33.751]  But here's the White House press secretary, Jim Psaki, saying, strike forces.
[00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.131]  That's a paramilitary term.
[00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.375]  Remember Obama said, we need a civilian force just as big, just as strong as our military.
[00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:44.299]  They would do it under the guise of community organizing and health department checks.
[00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:50.185]  And globally, here it is, the UN in charge of what you can say, what your doctor can do, what treatments you have.
[00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:57.031]  Who would have thought in the world government, day one, the UN's in charge of your medical, the UN's in charge of your speech through big tech with AI enforcing it.
[00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:57.552]  But it's all here.
[00:07:57.872 --> 00:07:59.373]  So, Saki, two days ago,
[00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:02.284]  said, oh, we're gonna come to your house.
[00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:02.966]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:05.490]  Then Biden said, no, we're coming to your house to give you the shot.
[00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.574]  Now they're saying, well, we're probably gonna push it on you.
[00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:08.395]  It's gonna be mandatory.
[00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:10.519]  We've got strike forces.
[00:08:11.513 --> 00:08:13.515]  You thought that was the Delta Force, the Navy SEALs?
[00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:13.795]  No.
[00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:14.656]  No, no, no.
[00:08:14.696 --> 00:08:25.184]  It's the left that's coming into your life to contact trace you via an app on your phone with little fake robot readers the size of a credit card reader to quote PCR test you.
[00:08:25.385 --> 00:08:29.548]  Or if you look like you're sick, they have this new authority outside of law to disappear you.
[00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:31.870]  It's called martial law takeover.
[00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.834]  Now the Canadian health minister said, oh, this is about control of information and our revolution.
[00:08:37.094 --> 00:08:38.536]  That's why the lockdowns continue.
[00:08:39.844 --> 00:08:41.526]  While they bankrupt all the small businesses.
[00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:43.728]  This is economic warfare.
[00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:44.689]  This is the new warfare.
[00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.490]  It's here.
[00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.172]  We're inside the New World Order.
[00:08:47.432 --> 00:08:49.134]  The full videos on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:53.039]  Here is the Press Secretary on strike forces coming to your house.
[00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:59.383]  First, is there a target for herd immunity for COVID vaccines?
[00:08:59.483 --> 00:08:59.783]  Is it 75%, 80%?
[00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:01.745]  What is that goal for the administration right now?
[00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:07.191]  Well, Dr. Fauci has addressed this a number of times and has conveyed that herd immunity is kind of an outdated term.
[00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:12.697]  So we had set a goal of reaching 70% of adults by July 4th.
[00:09:12.977 --> 00:09:14.419]  We reached that goal of
[00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:14.899]  I'm good.
[00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:37.947]  Strike forces.
[00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:38.367]  Strike forces.
[00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:38.567]  Military.
[00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:39.088]  Oh, you wear a mask.
[00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:39.548]  You're dirty.
[00:09:39.648 --> 00:09:41.248]  Oh, you can't go outside unless you've had the shot.
[00:09:41.288 --> 00:09:41.768]  That's their goal.
[00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:43.449]  Oh, the strike force is for you.
[00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:21.314]  It's all in the official plans, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, they're all getting billions of taxpayer money, and they've trained up these groups to go out on TV and normalize, not just forcibly inoculating like you saw in California, of people's children that didn't want it, or of disabled people, people in a wheelchair.
[00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:22.154]  No, please don't!
[00:10:22.274 --> 00:10:23.194]  Oh, we're sorry!
[00:10:24.215 --> 00:10:25.675]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:41.246]  It's going to be big tech surveilling you and tracking you with the apps they put on your phone, whether you like it or not, you can't uninstall them, sending these paramilitary forces to your homes.
[00:10:41.286 --> 00:10:43.127]  This has always been the plan.
[00:10:43.187 --> 00:10:48.451]  It's the same from Spain to New Zealand to Canada, and now next it's coming here, like I kept telling you.
[00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:50.593]  It's a UN-directed global plan.
[00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:56.397]  But Australia is made up of great people, but it was a penal colony, so they never got their real rights.
[00:10:57.543 --> 00:10:59.066]  And blue cities are under Global's control.
[00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:00.449]  They don't have any of their basic rights.
[00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:08.004]  And so they're beta testing it, perfecting it, testing the media there, making sure no one resists, and then rolling it out against the next group.
[00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:12.174]  We told you over a year ago it'll be variants.
[00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:14.837]  Oh, they locked down Sydney again.
[00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:20.261]  The Delta Plus variant inspired it, like it's artwork.
[00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:28.187]  Oh, no one's really dying, but don't worry, in the fall and winter when people don't get enough vitamin D, folks will die from regular viruses.
[00:11:28.368 --> 00:11:29.368]  We're gonna lock down again.
[00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:31.130]  Well, don't wait, they've already done it again!
[00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:38.116]  And Biden's considering new lockdowns to squeeze that middle class into oblivion.
[00:11:38.696 --> 00:11:39.076]  So here is
[00:11:40.302 --> 00:11:55.094]  The Australian health official, we'll get to in a moment, responds aggressively when asked about the government was embarrassed about mistakenly distributing COVID jabs forcibly to 160 grade 12 students.
[00:11:56.495 --> 00:11:58.136]  Just ordering them to was all a beta test.
[00:11:58.436 --> 00:11:59.677]  But first, let's play this next clip.
[00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:05.121]  New Zealand will hunt down those not vaccinated, says the government with strike teams.
[00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.542]  Here it is.
[00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:13.510]  I think early next year we'll be in the phase of chasing up people who haven't come forward to get their vaccination or have missed their bookings and so on.
[00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.234]  So everyone will be able to get a vaccine between now and the end of the year.
[00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:25.943]  But of course, you know, and I want every New Zealander to come forward, but human behaviour suggests that there will be some people that we have to actually really go out and look for.
[00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:28.664]  And some of that may spill into next year.
[00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:32.727]  But our commitment is everyone will have the opportunity to get the vaccine by the end of the year.
[00:12:33.227 --> 00:12:33.948]  Everyone will.
[00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:40.652]  But I can't say that we're not going to have some hesitant people or some people who just haven't come forward that we don't have to go out and find next year.
[00:12:41.532 --> 00:12:50.778]  Ah, with law enforcement, with apps, with your medical records, that you haven't taken the shot in your new medical ID that Klaus Schwab called for that we now have.
[00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:52.299]  So the police are coming.
[00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:55.621]  Just like they arrest you in New Zealand and Australia if you criticize lockdowns?
[00:12:55.941 --> 00:13:00.204]  Well, now you didn't take your shot, and so we're gonna come with the police to your house.
[00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:03.166]  Don't worry, they got a special shot for you.
[00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:06.268]  You know the government officials, they're getting that saline shot.
[00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:09.930]  They got a hot needle for you.
[00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:12.432]  Again, if I'd have told you this 10 years ago, would you have believed it?
[00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:13.713]  No, I did tell you 10 years ago.
[00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:19.717]  I said, world government lockdowns, forced inoculations is the key to the New World Order because it's in their own documents.
[00:13:21.283 --> 00:13:22.344]  Operation Lockstep and others.
[00:13:22.624 --> 00:13:24.185]  I could play you the clips from 10 years ago.
[00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.426]  Would you like me to?
[00:13:25.646 --> 00:13:26.066]  12 years ago.
[00:13:26.487 --> 00:13:27.387]  We've done it many times.
[00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:31.930]  Again, I get all the credit like I just looked into a crystal ball.
[00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:33.371]  It's a damn plan.
[00:13:33.832 --> 00:13:35.113]  Like Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.
[00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:41.777]  And said, I don't like a treaty of her size and I'm gonna throw it away and I'm gonna attack Europe and I'm gonna take over and I'm gonna... And he did it.
[00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:45.740]  And they're there telling us what they're doing.
[00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:48.782]  They're just doing it.
[00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:53.195]  And we're sitting here not realizing we're in the midst of a massive takeover.
[00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:57.258]  I want to come back and play a really powerful clip of when I predicted all this last year.
[00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.400]  Let's play that clip 13.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:05.365]  Here is the Australian, the health minister, arrogantly saying, it's a mistake, move on.
[00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:06.546]  It wasn't a mistake.
[00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:10.229]  They're forcibly, Cuomo said we're going to give kids shots whether they like it or not.
[00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:12.772]  This is serious crime, folks.
[00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:13.733]  These are really deadly.
[00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:14.874]  They attack fertility.
[00:14:14.894 --> 00:14:15.774]  They attack the brain and heart.
[00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:17.416]  There's an advisory on them now.
[00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:19.858]  By the way, I have a clip I didn't play yesterday of the U.S.
[00:14:19.898 --> 00:14:22.099]  military, the Pentagon, announcing forced inoculations.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.682]  And they said, by the way, this is not an approved vaccine, but we're going to do it anyways.
[00:14:26.943 --> 00:14:28.845]  But the average leftist, you go to Twitter, it's just everywhere.
[00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:30.266]  Alex Jones, the liar.
[00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.747]  These were approved, totally safe.
[00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:32.828]  Nobody ever got hurt.
[00:14:34.554 --> 00:14:38.142]  Next you'll say nobody ever died in a motorcycle accident or nobody ever fell off a cliff.
[00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:39.986]  I mean, it's damn gaslighting.
[00:14:40.307 --> 00:14:41.329]  Here is Australia.
[00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:52.988]  What I find more embarrassing, James, is that you would make that sort of question and accusation against frontline health staff who work their butts off and who tomorrow will have achieved a million vaccinations into arms.
[00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:54.109]  You know what?
[00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.942]  The school intended it well.
[00:15:09.202 --> 00:15:10.823]  There was a mistake, and so what?
[00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:11.544]  It's happened.
[00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:13.245]  Out of a million vaccinations, move on.
[00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:16.447]  The school intended it well.
[00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.449]  They're coming for you, and it will kill you.
[00:15:19.469 --> 00:15:20.390]  It'll take about five years.
[00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.611]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:32.598]  During the break here on the Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show, I got some more intel from a very good person, very good source.
[00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:37.666]  And it confirmed what I already knew and it confirmed what I already was going to be covering.
[00:15:38.287 --> 00:15:52.123]  I talked to Pastor Rodney Howard a few days ago at length about what happened at an event he put on with over 10,000 people at his church on the west coast of Florida.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.201]  And I've known him, hell, 10 years or so.
[00:15:56.261 --> 00:15:56.922]  He's a great guy.
[00:15:56.962 --> 00:15:57.602]  I've never seen him.
[00:15:57.622 --> 00:16:01.644]  I don't want to say shook up, but I've never seen him so concerned.
[00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:05.667]  And then we had some technical stuff because they were putting in new equipment and things in here the other day.
[00:16:05.687 --> 00:16:09.229]  I was unable to get him on in the morning because he couldn't come on when I was live.
[00:16:09.249 --> 00:16:14.932]  So he taped a 30 minute piece that he gave us two days ago that I still haven't posted to Band.Video.
[00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:21.155]  And what I'm going to do is just shoot an intro to it during one of these breaks and then post it to Band.Video.
[00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:27.338]  Let me just put it to you this way.
[00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:31.183]  We have a chance to stop another January 6th, but much bigger.
[00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:34.127]  And now we figured out what the Feds are doing and how they're doing it.
[00:16:35.468 --> 00:16:43.739]  And this is so big, I should probably just go off air at this point and just really get in a huddle with people and put out an emergency report.
[00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:47.427]  And I'm not saying that for dramatic effect.
[00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:51.771]  I mean, you know we know tomorrow's news today because my head's in the game all the time.
[00:16:53.152 --> 00:16:56.435]  I used to dream about fantasy stuff and, you know, things didn't make sense.
[00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:57.897]  Now my dreams are all like work.
[00:16:58.978 --> 00:17:02.301]  When I'm asleep at night, it's like how to raise my children better.
[00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:04.783]  Where should I move?
[00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:06.105]  What should I do during the collapse?
[00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:08.687]  What am I going to... How do I get right with God?
[00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.254]  I mean, last night it seemed like 20 years I was asleep.
[00:17:13.215 --> 00:17:24.380]  And I was just praying to God and talking to God and just... I think all of you are going through that right now because we're going to look back, as I said a year ago, on that as the good old times, and you're going to look back on today as the good old times.
[00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:25.641]  And I don't say that to scare you.
[00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.362]  I say that so you can get ready.
[00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.304]  A lot of folks ask me, well, how have you gotten ready?
[00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:38.308]  We got a trailer and put it out in the country and put a well in and we're putting solar in.
[00:17:39.628 --> 00:17:41.848]  And I know I got neighbors I can trust.
[00:17:42.749 --> 00:17:43.209]  And that's it.
[00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:45.889]  That's my rearguard action.
[00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.590]  So I got a lot of big news and them announcing pedophilia openly and saying, we're coming for your children.
[00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:56.531]  And you've got big tech saying that's their plan.
[00:17:56.591 --> 00:17:57.471]  And that's the goal.
[00:17:57.551 --> 00:17:58.831]  It's destroy innocence.
[00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.772]  That's what the satanic force wants.
[00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:08.313]  But I've seen so many people fall under this spell of evil.
[00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:20.142]  And the way it manipulates people's minds and brains, and Pastor Howard told me, we were talking this three or four days ago, he said, Alex, gosh, I guess that was Sunday.
[00:18:20.623 --> 00:18:22.223]  That was Sunday, seems like five minutes ago.
[00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:28.886]  Pastor Howard said, it's the Holy Spirit, only that'll give you discernment.
[00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:32.007]  He's like, that's why you've got such good discernment, it's why I've got discernment.
[00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:34.688]  And we were completely on the same page about this.
[00:18:35.969 --> 00:18:38.190]  And God, what they did to him,
[00:18:39.215 --> 00:18:42.838]  He told me a lot of stuff that he didn't put on record, because I recommended he not do it.
[00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:46.821]  But let me just tell you this.
[00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:48.883]  We are down to the wire here, folks.
[00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:51.045]  We are down to the wire.
[00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:53.527]  And it's spiritual.
[00:18:54.407 --> 00:18:57.830]  So many good people I knew are just completely mentally ill now.
[00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:05.196]  The pressure got to them and they believe they're under the command of Q, who they believe is President Trump.
[00:19:06.277 --> 00:19:06.757]  And it's not.
[00:19:07.218 --> 00:19:08.479]  It's the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.108]  They are planning uprisings around the country which will then be blamed on me and President Trump and others and then they'll try to arrest us and we've just got to stop them.
[00:19:24.749 --> 00:19:25.529]  We've got to stop them.
[00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:36.159]  So I have this whole show prepared and all these clips and all this news and I'm just sitting here watching this and I already knew what was going on but I just confirmed
[00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:41.188]  How sick these people are, how mentally ill they are.
[00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:53.251]  Q is telling people that I'm a Fed and I'm against Trump and that I've got to be taken out and that I've got to be sued and all these things, which is total delusion.
[00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:55.651]  These people never talk to Trump.
[00:19:55.691 --> 00:19:56.491]  They don't know Trump.
[00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:57.651]  Trump's surrounded.
[00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:58.531]  Trump's embattled.
[00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.092]  Trump can't even launch a website.
[00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.052]  He's trying to fight back.
[00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:01.712]  He's a great guy.
[00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.553]  I was with Trump at the border just last week.
[00:20:05.653 --> 00:20:06.973]  Just didn't make a big issue out of it.
[00:20:10.228 --> 00:20:33.988]  And that people are so gullible that they want to believe that they're secretly involved with Trump and secretly involved in a coming overthrow of the globalists so they can trigger a second capital attack somewhere else and then legitimize this federal report saying anybody that questions the election is a terrorist.
[00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.632]  And it's just total amateur.
[00:20:42.642 --> 00:20:44.503]  I'm going to have to expose all these groups and come out against them.
[00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:45.604]  I'm going to have to give them what they want.
[00:20:47.024 --> 00:20:55.509]  Because I am not going to sit by and watch them when we're politically winning and everybody's waking up and people see the world government, the pedophilia and the Satanism for what it is.
[00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:05.415]  And then they're going to try to literally through the internet and through delusional BS believe someone text messaging them is secretly Trump.
[00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:11.651]  And that Trump's saying, get Alex Jones, get Roger Stone, get General Flynn.
[00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:20.337]  And I mean, I saw the things that Q is saying about General Flynn and about us and the things that these people hear.
[00:21:21.277 --> 00:21:26.020]  And because they want to believe that they're talking to someone famous, President Trump, they believe.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.281]  It's a spirit, though.
[00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:28.422]  I mean, it's it's satanic.
[00:21:28.702 --> 00:21:29.943]  It's like literally mind control.
[00:21:30.443 --> 00:21:33.645]  But I guess they're already prepped by it, by the media and the culture and all of it.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.543]  And you can just see the endgame ticking down right now.
[00:21:41.106 --> 00:21:41.847]  It's so sad.
[00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:44.209]  It's so disgusting.
[00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.231]  I'm going to get to that later.
[00:21:46.251 --> 00:21:52.357]  I'm going to decide how I'm going to proceed with this, but this is just beyond schizophrenia.
[00:21:52.397 --> 00:21:53.358]  This is demon possession.
[00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:55.980]  They're giving a great delusion.
[00:21:57.034 --> 00:21:59.034]  And you know, maybe the country's not supposed to be safe.
[00:21:59.114 --> 00:22:03.936]  Maybe God's giving them over to great delusion and that we're not actually supposed to save the country.
[00:22:04.576 --> 00:22:04.976]  I don't know.
[00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:10.437]  I'm just going to do the right thing and tell the truth and, you know, move forward and be a good person.
[00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:19.319]  But the scrabbling and the power vacuums and the manipulation and all of it is just beyond anything I've ever seen.
[00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.531]  And it's so incredibly sad.
[00:22:23.011 --> 00:22:25.912]  We've been here steadfastly telling you what's coming next for decades.
[00:22:26.492 --> 00:22:28.593]  We've been here steadfastly promoting American values.
[00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:42.519]  And it just goes to show that right now we're in the zeitgeist and the forces of evil are trying to take out America's greatest supporters through a esoteric, gnostic,
[00:22:45.023 --> 00:23:06.908]  Oracle of Delphi hole in the wall that they just come to and then get their orders from and believe that they're then marching forward as Christian soldiers who are about to launch some devastating attack, you know, against the deep state when they're being led by the deep state directly into the provocation that will bring the country down once and for all.
[00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:11.429]  And then all I want to do is just leave the country and just leave all these crazy people to themselves.
[00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:14.170]  I mean, maybe America really is over.
[00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.677]  I just don't want to be part of the mental illness.
[00:23:16.717 --> 00:23:20.258]  I want to go hide in the desert somewhere and just, you know, read the Bible.
[00:23:20.638 --> 00:23:27.800]  I mean, I just, thank God, thank you, Jesus, that I have not been under this delusion and that you've given me discernment.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.641]  Thank you, God.
[00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:34.002]  Please take me to your bosom and help me maintain my sanity and not join these people.
[00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:41.145]  Because this is just, this is full evil being thrown at the country and the world right now.
[00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.751]  Absolute, full, complete, total satanism.
[00:23:47.911 --> 00:23:50.171]  And we'll come back.
[00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:58.593]  San Francisco Pedophile Men's Chorus, the official San Francisco choir, says we are getting your kids, we will corrupt them, we will have sex with them.
[00:23:59.733 --> 00:24:01.253]  Don't you take it lying down.
[00:24:05.274 --> 00:24:09.535]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:13.962]  There's a global awakening happening.
[00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:15.303]  Things are going to be all right.
[00:24:18.665 --> 00:24:22.707]  I do want to open the phones up in the second and third hour today ahead of Matt Bracken coming on.
[00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:28.351]  So totally open phone second and third hour to get into the news and information right now.
[00:24:28.451 --> 00:24:30.492]  But I have dropped the ball.
[00:24:31.373 --> 00:24:34.855]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is a really smart guy.
[00:24:36.093 --> 00:24:50.322]  And he grew up in South Africa and been all over the world and been through hell and built his own huge mega church and brought millions to Christ all over the world, travels hundreds of days out of the year to Africa, Latin America, Asia, you name it.
[00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:55.025]  And he called me and he said, I got to brief you on this.
[00:24:55.085 --> 00:24:56.146]  I stopped the false flag.
[00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:57.467]  They tried to set us up.
[00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:21.421]  And then I just got too busy on the morning he could tape and we had a technical issue so we couldn't do the interview but he taped me a 30-minute deal that we're gonna post a Bandod video this afternoon where he lays this out and and then what he covered ties into everything and again this is so big that I have to digest it a little bit and figure out
[00:25:24.838 --> 00:25:25.879]  How I want to present it.
[00:25:25.999 --> 00:25:28.020]  And it's not that I want to keep something from you.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.223]  It's so big that I don't want to just blurt stuff out and get it wrong.
[00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:33.903]  Does that make sense?
[00:25:34.723 --> 00:25:39.326]  Because I'm such a fire and forget guy that I just go with my gut and go with my instincts, go with my spirit.
[00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:45.269]  And it's always super accurate, but I can get a few of the words wrong and then it doesn't explain what's happening.
[00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:51.572]  But, you know, I mean, I really think it comes down to this.
[00:25:53.053 --> 00:25:54.014]  I'm at a point of
[00:25:56.758 --> 00:26:02.140]  I don't want to call it choking, but nobody's got a pay grade at this.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.081]  I'm certainly way, this is way above my pay grade, as they say.
[00:26:08.662 --> 00:26:13.164]  So, I mean, just one of the problems we deal with each day, people would take years to figure out.
[00:26:14.284 --> 00:26:20.807]  And so when I say that, it's just that I've reached a point now where, you know, I don't go like, oh, great.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.522]  I've got the main orchestra in San Francisco saying we're gonna rape your kids.
[00:26:25.843 --> 00:26:26.643]  I can prove they're evil.
[00:26:26.663 --> 00:26:27.624]  I already know it!
[00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:31.107]  And they're coming and they're so arrogant they put it on TV!
[00:26:31.307 --> 00:26:32.748]  They're gonna rape our children!
[00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.112]  And what, I'm just supposed to turn this into a show where I talk about it?
[00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:41.655]  We're almost like part of it when we just cover it.
[00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:49.922]  And then what slaves these men are and their bug-eyed pedo eyes and just they all look like Brian Stelter.
[00:26:53.439 --> 00:26:58.023]  And I'm just like, how did we get to this point?
[00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:03.027]  Because I want to run off in a cabin in Colorado for a month.
[00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:09.192]  But when I come back out of the cabin, they'll might be at the foot of the hill coming to get me.
[00:27:09.212 --> 00:27:09.612]  You know what I mean?
[00:27:09.913 --> 00:27:11.274]  I can't run away from them.
[00:27:11.574 --> 00:27:12.555]  I don't want to fight them.
[00:27:12.775 --> 00:27:13.876]  I don't want to look at them.
[00:27:14.717 --> 00:27:17.119]  I don't want to be, but see, oh, they're going to look at us.
[00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:37.565]  I've watched all these Klaus Schwab and UN videos, where these really creepy evil men are like, we gotta get the kids, and we're gonna go in their houses next, and we're gonna take over their houses, and we're gonna... and people then ask me a year later, how'd you know they're coming to our houses?
[00:27:41.749 --> 00:27:43.110]  They said so!
[00:27:45.103 --> 00:27:48.864]  I just said, the archivist can find it, the guy's incredible, I know how he does, finds it all.
[00:27:49.224 --> 00:27:50.465]  So I'm on air like four or five hours a day.
[00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:58.027]  I just said, two weeks ago, I said, they'll be on national TV by the end of the year, saying, we're coming for your kids, we're gonna have sex with them.
[00:27:58.347 --> 00:28:01.888]  And it was not in the next six months or a year, it was two weeks later.
[00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:05.770]  And by the way, it's not just the San Francisco thing.
[00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:13.192]  When that came out yesterday and they said, we're gonna have sex with your kids, we're gonna corrupt your kids, is the quote, we're gonna take them over.
[00:28:14.517 --> 00:28:21.027]  People found like 12 more videos that I was sent where I'm like, I can't even watch these things anymore!
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:30.004]  And then I got all these other videos where we're coming with injections, we're gonna give them to you no matter what you want.
[00:28:30.304 --> 00:28:31.625]  And they even giggle.
[00:28:31.825 --> 00:28:37.468]  And we're gonna keep the lockdowns in so you can't talk to people, so none of you can organize against us.
[00:28:37.668 --> 00:28:43.772]  I mean, they're even joking around like I'm in I Am Legend and the Devil's like...
[00:28:52.739 --> 00:29:04.688]  Because let me tell you, 25 years ago I'd be getting ready for a radio show and I'd have some incredible new or older stuff and I'd be like, oh I got them, I'd be so excited, oh look, I got them, I got them admitting they're pedophiles right here, I'm gonna get them.
[00:29:04.748 --> 00:29:07.851]  And 10,000 pedophile stories later I'm like, I'll probably get arrested.
[00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:12.416]  They threatened to arrest the mom at the Wii Spa in L.A.
[00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:26.443]  when the man with a beard and huge genitals gets in the private women's hot tub with a six-year-old and starts playing with his penis in front of her, and the women run and call the police, and the police show up and say, you're the bad people!
[00:29:36.038 --> 00:29:39.641]  I'll give the number out to take calls next segment and I'll also get to the video.
[00:29:41.242 --> 00:29:48.547]  It's just, I mean, it's almost obscene to just cover hundreds of articles that show their evil takeover when we already know what's happening.
[00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:49.848]  It's the same thing you've seen.
[00:29:49.868 --> 00:29:50.209]  I've got...
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:30:01.987]  Seven articles, I looked in my stack, without even looking for them, of young people in America dying of blood clots in the brain, or the heart, or the lungs, when they took the Pfizer and Moderna shots.
[00:30:02.388 --> 00:30:06.491]  Every day, this person died, that person, and we're probably hearing of one out of a hundred.
[00:30:08.112 --> 00:30:13.175]  Here's another dead person, there's another dead person, here's another dead person, we're just sitting here watching it all.
[00:30:14.997 --> 00:30:18.179]  And the average person goes, well, I'm going to comply with this, so they pass me over.
[00:30:21.237 --> 00:30:21.777]  It's incredible.
[00:30:21.817 --> 00:30:22.337]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:30:22.357 --> 00:30:24.598]  We're going to come back and cover it all here today.
[00:30:24.638 --> 00:30:25.878]  But it is just insane.
[00:30:25.898 --> 00:30:32.159]  And they've got the Q armies again that are controlled by the feds.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.641]  Leading people towards violence so they can legitimize the Terrorism Act saying we're all terrorists.
[00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:42.262]  And that's getting ready to happen.
[00:30:42.742 --> 00:30:44.962]  And we're just sitting here watching it all unfold.
[00:30:47.383 --> 00:30:48.323]  God Almighty help us.
[00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.652]  God says, you didn't help all those babies got aborted.
[00:30:52.774 --> 00:30:57.759]  You didn't help those Chinese Christians and Muslims and Buddhists in slave camps, so I'm not gonna help you.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.042]  And I'm like, I know you're right.
[00:31:01.644 --> 00:31:02.725]  But it still doesn't make it fun.
[00:31:06.209 --> 00:31:06.750]  God's good.
[00:31:08.803 --> 00:31:10.124]  In fact, God's been very lenient.
[00:31:10.584 --> 00:31:13.607]  And God gets to a point where God is not going to condone what we're doing.
[00:31:13.847 --> 00:31:16.529]  Because if God doesn't judge us, God's involved in this.
[00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:18.050]  Because God gave us free will.
[00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.971]  God didn't do any of this.
[00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:20.252]  God's perfect.
[00:31:20.452 --> 00:31:21.112]  Is perfect.
[00:31:21.273 --> 00:31:22.694]  Oh, so perfect.
[00:31:23.556 --> 00:31:30.659]  Except the one crime, God argues this, I tell you, in God's mind, God argues this, was it right to create consciousness and allow you to do this?
[00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:32.579]  God actually feels guilty.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.100]  Even though God's perfect.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.121]  But it is perfect to create more, isn't it?
[00:31:36.421 --> 00:31:37.281]  Yes, I'm glad I'm here.
[00:31:37.441 --> 00:31:38.261]  No, that was smart, God!
[00:31:38.442 --> 00:31:39.462]  Thank you for giving me consciousness!
[00:31:39.662 --> 00:31:40.742]  No, no, no, that was a mistake!
[00:31:40.902 --> 00:31:41.783]  Please don't destroy us!
[00:31:42.103 --> 00:31:42.423]  Please!
[00:31:42.803 --> 00:31:44.344]  Don't, don't, don't, don't blow us up!
[00:31:44.524 --> 00:31:45.284]  Please, we're sorry!
[00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:46.825]  You did the right thing, don't do it!
[00:31:48.945 --> 00:31:50.166]  God is expecting us
[00:31:52.332 --> 00:31:55.315]  To stand up to this and do the right thing, and we're not.
[00:31:57.317 --> 00:32:03.502]  When they declare, we're coming for your children, we're going to rape your children, we're going to corrupt your children, I'm pleased if you don't want to come back.
[00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:05.224]  That is their charge.
[00:32:05.264 --> 00:32:07.926]  That is their, we want your children.
[00:32:09.864 --> 00:32:12.065]  It's all an act of like, oh, I'm a feminine man.
[00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:14.505]  Oh, that's the cover, like a snake.
[00:32:15.445 --> 00:32:17.026]  Hi, I'm a friend.
[00:32:17.046 --> 00:32:17.866]  No, you're not a friend.
[00:32:18.106 --> 00:32:30.349]  You want children because you're these empty, soulless creatures that are just, just lisping and begging and wanting in to be given control to destroy the future.
[00:32:35.649 --> 00:32:37.530]  Total oblivion.
[00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:43.414]  A soul turned over to evil, trying to show you an Eddie's happy mind.
[00:32:43.474 --> 00:32:43.935]  But it's not.
[00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:52.580]  It's an enslaved, destroyed, lost person who's lost their soul, lost their connection to God, and who's just saying, I need your children.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.402]  I'm coming.
[00:32:55.002 --> 00:32:56.683]  I'm going to corrupt them.
[00:32:57.444 --> 00:32:59.665]  Give them to me.
[00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:02.327]  I have hoisted the black flag of death.
[00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.289]  Give me your children.
[00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:08.551]  I am the Grim Reaper!
[00:33:09.212 --> 00:33:13.715]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:15.036]  The globalists know.
[00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:35.662]  The Satanists know they're going down.
[00:33:38.546 --> 00:33:39.568]  And they want to take us with them.
[00:33:39.948 --> 00:33:41.430]  They want to take our dear children with them.
[00:33:41.831 --> 00:33:42.672]  We're going to let them do that?
[00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:48.861]  Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
[00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:49.582]  Galatians 4.16.
[00:33:56.593 --> 00:34:06.202]  "...and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, became they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
[00:34:06.422 --> 00:34:19.954]  And for this reason God will send them strong delusion that they should believe in a lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:21.635]  2 Thessalonians 2 10 12
[00:34:24.209 --> 00:34:29.871]  And that doesn't mean that we haven't been hateful, or been in a fight, or cheated on somebody, or done something wrong.
[00:34:29.891 --> 00:34:33.312]  The difference is we know it's wrong, we're sad for it later, and we repent of it.
[00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.833]  We know what's good, we know what's evil.
[00:34:36.293 --> 00:34:40.995]  It's the celebration of evil that is pure Satanism.
[00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:42.436]  So let me play this little piece.
[00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:44.156]  This could be 10 hours long, literally.
[00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:46.957]  This is a minute, or three and a half minutes long.
[00:34:48.158 --> 00:34:51.639]  We just put it together during the show today, and it cuts into the
[00:34:52.970 --> 00:35:05.396]  San Francisco city-sponsored choir, they call the gay choir, but it's really the pedophile choir, saying, your children will be corrupted.
[00:35:05.496 --> 00:35:06.477]  We will take them over.
[00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.777]  They will recruit for us.
[00:35:07.817 --> 00:35:08.638]  They will join us.
[00:35:08.678 --> 00:35:10.038]  We're coming for your children.
[00:35:10.258 --> 00:35:11.159]  These are all quotes.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.761]  Exactly what I told you, because that's who these people are.
[00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:19.323]  And most of these men were abused as children that you're going to see in this video.
[00:35:20.343 --> 00:35:21.324]  They were raped as children.
[00:35:22.756 --> 00:35:25.136]  And that's why they seem so weak, so empty, so pathetic.
[00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:31.818]  They're in a cult now calling for more children because that's how they believe that they have children.
[00:35:32.018 --> 00:35:33.058]  They don't go marry a woman.
[00:35:33.078 --> 00:35:33.778]  They don't have a job.
[00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:34.598]  They don't raise a child.
[00:35:34.878 --> 00:35:36.099]  They get your child.
[00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:38.919]  And they have sex.
[00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:39.879]  They rape your child.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.680]  They defile your child.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.681]  And California legalized giving people HIV and hepatitis because that's a sacrament to them.
[00:35:50.455 --> 00:36:03.261]  The same pedophile army that took over the Vatican, took over Penn State, took over all these other institutions, it's now taken over and now it is announcing and blowing its bugle and saying, your children are ours, we're coming for them.
[00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:12.425]  Here's a few clips of them saying this previously and now announced officially by the city of San Francisco and put out, but they pulled it down in hours because it had a 99% down vote.
[00:36:15.828 --> 00:36:19.589]  But see, they're in such echo chambers that they believe we're ready for this.
[00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.372]  But our children at public schools, they're teaching them critical race theory, they're teaching them all this when you're not there.
[00:36:25.652 --> 00:36:27.212]  They're screwing your children over.
[00:36:30.974 --> 00:36:38.937]  Here in Austin, Texas, I know people that send their children to public school, and in the second grade, they're teaching them that white people are bad, and that you must be a lesbian, you must be gay.
[00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:42.518]  And the little seven-year-olds come home to their parents and say, I'm gay.
[00:36:42.538 --> 00:36:43.499]  I was told I'm gay.
[00:36:44.878 --> 00:36:46.799]  You tell them no, oh the CPS is called.
[00:36:47.079 --> 00:37:00.645]  These are perverts confusing and screwing with their children and teaching them about a sexual lifestyle that's incredibly destructive with devil horns and bath-o-mat.
[00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:06.407]  These are perverts that didn't get into schooling because they wanted to help children.
[00:37:06.427 --> 00:37:13.090]  They got in there because they wanted to rape their minds because they are under the control of the dark force destroying our planet right now.
[00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.052]  And you're going to figure it out, because things are going to get really bad.
[00:37:16.312 --> 00:37:17.693]  God's pulling out of the world right now.
[00:37:19.815 --> 00:37:20.976]  And now you're going to be left with evil.
[00:37:21.857 --> 00:37:23.018]  And now you're going to be forced to wake up.
[00:37:23.438 --> 00:37:26.241]  There's a few minutes of what's officially on TV.
[00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:28.403]  This is at city council meetings, you name it.
[00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:35.028]  This is, this is, this is, we, these are men, organized groups of men, go with crazy looks in their eyes.
[00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.090]  We're coming for your children!
[00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.731]  There it is.
[00:37:38.837 --> 00:37:45.680]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:51.683]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:37:51.923 --> 00:37:57.246]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable just seeing it.
[00:37:57.486 --> 00:38:00.607]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:38:01.068 --> 00:38:05.730]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.211]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:10.092]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[00:38:10.452 --> 00:38:15.035]  Learn to love, learn to vogue, face your fate.
[00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:17.936]  We'll convert your children.
[00:38:18.597 --> 00:38:21.938]  Someone's gotta teach them not to hate.
[00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:25.981]  We're coming for them.
[00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:29.022]  We're coming for your children.
[00:38:42.578 --> 00:38:47.241]  Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[00:38:47.341 --> 00:38:53.507]  Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[00:38:53.547 --> 00:39:00.872]  Then soon we're almost certain, your kids will start converting.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.060]  I don't know.
[00:39:39.045 --> 00:40:02.217]  We'll convert your children Then we'll turn to you Giving up the fear inside It's screaming like you never knew Go and see San Francisco Go and turn up that disco You'll forget you were ever upset We'll convert your children
[00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:29.090]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:34.615]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[00:40:34.735 --> 00:40:36.557]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[00:40:37.157 --> 00:40:38.579]  We can both be grooms.
[00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:41.802]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[00:40:46.172 --> 00:40:55.015]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:40:55.295 --> 00:41:03.699]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:07.300]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.381]  This is Tatiana Valinia, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:12.782]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:41:12.802 --> 00:41:13.923]  A stardom young, right?
[00:41:14.023 --> 00:41:15.663]  A stardom young, right?
[00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.951]  It's all out in the open now, isn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:41:34.738 --> 00:41:37.841]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour, give the number out, and get into all the news.
[00:41:38.321 --> 00:41:40.003]  The forced inoculation squads are coming.
[00:41:40.043 --> 00:41:48.011]  I want to describe how they're going to hit us with them, how some of these forced inoculation squad people in the most dangerous neighborhoods in America are going to get killed.
[00:41:49.452 --> 00:41:51.234]  Then, if you don't take the shot, you're a terrorist.
[00:41:51.254 --> 00:41:54.777]  They're going to have SWAT teams behind the forced inoculation squads.
[00:41:55.098 --> 00:41:59.262]  Believe me, you'll be in a year or so watching all this I'm saying now is already going to happen.
[00:42:00.464 --> 00:42:02.047]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[00:42:02.648 --> 00:42:03.690]  Gives me a headache to do it.
[00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.411]  It actually does.
[00:42:05.212 --> 00:42:06.695]  But I'm going to fold space.
[00:42:07.436 --> 00:42:13.006]  And when we come back, we're going to tell you what's coming next here on the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:13.707 --> 00:42:14.148]  But first.
[00:42:15.786 --> 00:42:28.434]  If you want to energize us when we are completely committed to fighting the satanic force as best we can, then you need to energize us with money at infowarestore.com so I can complete this operation and this mission.

[00:42:53.378 --> 00:42:56.142]  But I will treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.781]  And I need your support.
[00:42:58.901 --> 00:42:59.922]  You need my support.
[00:43:00.002 --> 00:43:01.243]  We are in this together.

[00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:46.359]  X2.
[00:43:55.575 --> 00:43:57.776]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[00:43:58.037 --> 00:44:06.702]  Last week, last Monday, we told you that the Biden administration's largest intelligence gathering agency, the NSA, had been reading my private emails.
[00:44:06.762 --> 00:44:08.143]  Even saying that out loud is weird.
[00:44:08.183 --> 00:44:10.765]  It's one of those segments we never thought we would do ever.
[00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.387]  But the country has changed that much that fast.
[00:44:13.427 --> 00:44:15.388]  And honestly, the whole thing was kind of shocking.
[00:44:15.728 --> 00:44:17.229]  The government was spying on us.
[00:44:17.249 --> 00:44:17.550]  Come on.
[00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:18.851]  It seemed crazy.
[00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:23.481]  But it's true, and no one in Washington appeared to be shocked in the slightest.
[00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:27.563]  In fact, the usual shills right after our segment had a ready explanation for it.
[00:44:28.164 --> 00:44:38.749]  Either it never happened at all, they said, just a cable news show lying for ratings, or there must have been a good reason it happened, and they began furiously making excuses for why the NSA did it.
[00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:43.512]  A powerful, heavily politicized spy agency surveilling journalists who've been critical of the regime?
[00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:45.693]  No problem, it's perfectly normal.
[00:44:46.033 --> 00:44:47.194]  Just don't call it spying.
[00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:50.248]  But it's not normal, at all.
[00:44:50.548 --> 00:44:51.429]  It is third world.
[00:44:52.029 --> 00:44:54.172]  And as we told you repeatedly, it did happen.
[00:44:54.752 --> 00:44:55.993]  Now that has been confirmed.
[00:44:56.594 --> 00:45:04.722]  Yesterday we learned that sources in the so-called intelligence community told at least one reporter in Washington what was in those emails, my emails.
[00:45:05.163 --> 00:45:08.065]  There was nothing scandalous in there, thank God, we're happy to report that.
[00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:13.890]  Late this spring, I contacted a couple of people I thought could help get us an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.053]  I told nobody I was doing this other than my executive producer, Justin Wells.
[00:45:18.614 --> 00:45:20.795]  I wasn't embarrassed about trying to interview Putin.
[00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.176]  He's obviously newsworthy.
[00:45:22.336 --> 00:45:23.277]  I'm an American citizen.
[00:45:23.297 --> 00:45:26.380]  I can interview anyone I want and I plan to.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.402]  But still, in this case, I decided to keep it quiet.
[00:45:29.582 --> 00:45:34.185]  I figured that any kind of publicity would rattle the Russians and make the interview less likely to happen.
[00:45:35.006 --> 00:45:38.407]  But the Biden administration found out anyway by reading my emails.
[00:45:39.247 --> 00:45:44.569]  I learned from a whistleblower the NSA planned to leak the contents of those emails to media outlets.
[00:45:44.949 --> 00:45:45.769]  Why would they do that?
[00:45:46.389 --> 00:45:55.912]  Well, the point, of course, was to paint me as a disloyal American, a Russian operative, been called that before, a stooge of the Kremlin, a traitor doing the bidding of a foreign adversary.
[00:45:56.412 --> 00:46:01.013]  And of course, I'm hardly the only person who's been accused of those things in the last several years.
[00:46:01.313 --> 00:46:03.114]  We've seen this movie several times now.
[00:46:03.934 --> 00:46:12.984]  At the same moment the Communist Chinese government increases its already stunning level of control over this country, our leaders prattle on about the threat of Vladimir Putin.
[00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:15.227]  He's an evildoer, they tell us.
[00:46:15.567 --> 00:46:17.229]  A totalitarian dictator.
[00:46:17.509 --> 00:46:21.273]  Vladimir Putin does things that no American leader would even consider.
[00:46:22.014 --> 00:46:24.436]  He runs domestic disinformation campaigns.
[00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:25.977]  He lies to the public.
[00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:30.739]  He punishes people for opposing him, or for believing the wrong things.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.482]  He even uses intelligence agencies to spy on his own citizens.
[00:46:35.763 --> 00:46:37.063]  Beyond the pale stuff.
[00:46:37.844 --> 00:46:42.187]  So no decent American would interview Vladimir Putin, at least no reporter from Fox News.
[00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:44.660]  That was the point they wanted to make.
[00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:48.965]  That's why they plan to leak the contents of my emails to news organizations.
[00:46:49.025 --> 00:46:51.648]  And yesterday, as noted, we learned they actually did it.
[00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.432]  Even now, some in the media are claiming that we deserve this.
[00:46:56.053 --> 00:46:58.075]  Emailing with people who know Putin, are you?
[00:46:58.416 --> 00:46:59.997]  Of course the NSA is watching you.
[00:47:00.057 --> 00:47:00.878]  That's what you get.
[00:47:02.093 --> 00:47:03.334]  But that's hardly the point.
[00:47:04.095 --> 00:47:11.683]  By law, the NSA is required to keep secret the identities of American citizens who've been caught up in its vast domestic spying operations.
[00:47:12.404 --> 00:47:16.928]  So by law, I should have been identified internally merely as a U.S.
[00:47:17.048 --> 00:47:19.131]  journalist or American journalist.
[00:47:19.151 --> 00:47:19.731]  That's the law.
[00:47:20.512 --> 00:47:21.794]  But that's not how I was identified.
[00:47:21.814 --> 00:47:22.935]  I was identified by name.
[00:47:23.096 --> 00:47:24.277]  I was unmasked.
[00:47:24.778 --> 00:47:26.600]  People in the building learned who I was.
[00:47:27.221 --> 00:47:33.870]  And then my name and the contents of my emails left that building at the NSA and wound up with a news organization in Washington.
[00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:35.352]  That is illegal.
[00:47:35.993 --> 00:47:40.459]  In fact, it is precisely what this law was designed to prevent in the first place.
[00:47:40.939 --> 00:47:45.606]  We cannot have intelligence agencies used as instruments of political control.
[00:47:46.026 --> 00:47:47.848]  Both parties used to agree on that.
[00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:50.392]  Democrats were especially adamant on the point.
[00:47:50.732 --> 00:47:51.513]  But not anymore.
[00:47:52.034 --> 00:47:54.117]  So that's exactly what is happening here.
[00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:56.686]  We need to find out how this happened.
[00:47:56.726 --> 00:47:57.187]  Who did it?
[00:47:57.827 --> 00:47:58.467]  Who allowed it?
[00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:00.748]  Paul Nakasone would know the answer.
[00:48:00.788 --> 00:48:03.969]  Paul Nakasone is the highly political director of the NSA.
[00:48:04.529 --> 00:48:09.170]  Paul Nakasone would have been required personally to approve my unmasking.
[00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:10.531]  That's how it works.
[00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:14.772]  Paul Nakasone should explain who asked for that unmasking, and he should do it immediately.
[00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:17.493]  Averill Haynes would also likely know the answer.
[00:48:17.873 --> 00:48:21.494]  Haynes is the even more political director of national intelligence.
[00:48:21.514 --> 00:48:22.515]  She oversees all of it.
[00:48:23.055 --> 00:48:24.775]  She may have approved the unmasking as well.
[00:48:24.795 --> 00:48:27.796]  She would certainly know who asked for it and who approved it.
[00:48:28.217 --> 00:48:29.157]  That's her job to know.
[00:48:29.777 --> 00:48:32.278]  She should release that information immediately, tonight.
[00:48:32.998 --> 00:48:36.960]  And if Averill Haynes does not release that information, she should be forced to release that information.
[00:48:37.858 --> 00:48:44.400]  We don't have a lot of power as a TV show, but we're going to keep pushing for that, because it matters, not just to us, but to the entire country.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.762]  You can't have a democracy... Duhas!
[00:48:48.922 --> 00:48:50.023]  Duhas Mish!
[00:48:50.863 --> 00:48:52.383]  You got me, is what that says!
[00:48:57.405 --> 00:48:57.926]  Jesus!
[00:48:59.026 --> 00:48:59.566]  Duhas!
[00:49:00.847 --> 00:49:01.327]  You got me!
[00:49:03.775 --> 00:49:08.637]  And I am so glad I'm in those arms because now I can see everything.
[00:49:09.698 --> 00:49:14.720]  And I see how weak I am and how small I am and how silly the narcissistic satanism is.
[00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:17.401]  Now I can see the whole universe.
[00:49:18.802 --> 00:49:19.702]  But I didn't create it.
[00:49:20.883 --> 00:49:21.823]  I don't even understand it.
[00:49:22.524 --> 00:49:23.264]  But I can see it.
[00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:25.925]  And do I feel small?
[00:49:26.305 --> 00:49:31.788]  But in feeling small, I feel so big because I can consciously
[00:49:34.633 --> 00:49:37.494]  I can contend with that majesty that is God.
[00:49:38.255 --> 00:49:39.335]  I can worship.
[00:49:40.736 --> 00:49:42.517]  I can turn my will over to God.
[00:49:43.478 --> 00:49:46.319]  And in that, my will is expanded one trillion times.
[00:49:46.599 --> 00:49:47.360]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:54.063]  I mean, everything that Satan would seek, they would have it times a trillion, and they would just join Christ.
[00:49:54.884 --> 00:49:57.305]  But see, they're fools.
[00:49:59.106 --> 00:50:00.086]  They know nothing about it.
[00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:02.968]  And so we must oppose them.
[00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:07.593]  All right, I want to give the number out.
[00:50:07.613 --> 00:50:09.895]  I want to take your calls on this Thursday edition.
[00:50:11.696 --> 00:50:13.338]  There's so much to cover here, my God.
[00:50:13.378 --> 00:50:21.485]  We've got the Globalist Next Battle plan to shut down all the small businesses in the power grid, and they're going to do it, just like the sun came up this morning.
[00:50:21.525 --> 00:50:25.869]  It's all written, not just by God, but by them.
[00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:32.215]  What's crazy is how they follow exactly God's plan while they're at war with God constantly.
[00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.451]  That's always the most interesting part about it.
[00:50:37.532 --> 00:50:42.136]  Because they cannot get outside of that gravity well.
[00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:52.583]  They think they're contending with God by resisting God, and instead they put themselves in a sub-basement.
[00:50:53.884 --> 00:51:00.689]  Instead, if you actually join God and serve your will, then your will is expanded, and then you're given the full view.
[00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.792]  But see, they would never give the devil that type of view.
[00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:06.791]  All right, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:51:11.174 --> 00:51:12.375]  Here's the best thing for me to do.
[00:51:18.819 --> 00:51:19.339]  Let me do this.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.721]  Look at this stack on COVID, man.
[00:51:22.801 --> 00:51:23.542]  God Almighty.
[00:51:24.202 --> 00:51:26.684]  I mean, this is worse than I thought it would be.
[00:51:28.305 --> 00:51:32.548]  Sydney extends Delta-inspired COVID lockdowns for another two weeks.
[00:51:34.141 --> 00:51:34.621]  Video.
[00:51:34.721 --> 00:51:38.604]  White House says strike forces are being sent to get kids vaccinated.
[00:51:40.565 --> 00:51:41.826]  New Zealand Health Minister.
[00:51:41.866 --> 00:51:47.549]  Government will be chasing out and down unvaccinated people and coming after them.
[00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:49.230]  I mean, I already played the clip.
[00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:50.291]  Can't make that up.
[00:51:50.711 --> 00:51:52.212]  Fauci demands vaccine hesitance.
[00:51:52.552 --> 00:51:54.273]  Get over this political statement.
[00:51:57.315 --> 00:52:02.678]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on from then.
[00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:08.476]  Well, let's do this.
[00:52:08.556 --> 00:52:18.600]  Let's air a clip from last year, and there's a couple other clips from this year, where I specifically say the contact tracers are coming to your house.
[00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:21.821]  Here it is.
[00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:28.303]  Rosen will outline five areas his team is focused on to get more Americans vaccinated.
[00:52:28.924 --> 00:52:38.968]  One, targeted community-by-community door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is.
[00:52:39.408 --> 00:52:47.492]  They're establishing Maoist-style brigades across Europe and the United States that will be the general public in uniforms
[00:52:49.019 --> 00:52:50.599]  Enforcing forced inoculation.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.100]  They're going to use peer pressure to do it.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:59.122]  And they're going to use a medical tyranny because they can claim that it's, quote, un-ideological.
[00:53:00.542 --> 00:53:04.523]  This is exactly what I would do if I was going to be taking over like this.
[00:53:05.423 --> 00:53:17.166]  National brigades coming to forcibly inoculate you and your family, reporting and tracking with dogs that, quote, smell COVID.
[00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:20.440]  Oh, but it's not political.
[00:53:21.041 --> 00:53:28.306]  It's for everyone's safety, but it's the Democrats and the WHO with all their fake models and all their lies and Fauci running the lab.
[00:53:29.187 --> 00:53:35.111]  Congress introduces bill to allow government to mass test Americans for COVID-19 in their homes.
[00:53:36.352 --> 00:53:36.933]  Forcibly.
[00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:41.076]  And ladies and gentlemen, let me give you
[00:53:42.813 --> 00:53:45.719]  The bill number, shall I?
[00:53:45.739 --> 00:53:46.881]  6-6-6-6.
[00:53:47.602 --> 00:53:54.576]  Just like that, world governments announced forced inoculations and plantable microchips.
[00:53:55.868 --> 00:53:57.809]  Tracer teams to come inspect your home.
[00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:01.792]  And now 60 plus days later, it's like, oh, this is never going to end.
[00:54:02.212 --> 00:54:03.213]  We're going to come to your house.
[00:54:03.593 --> 00:54:04.173]  They now are.
[00:54:04.193 --> 00:54:04.794]  I have the articles.
[00:54:04.854 --> 00:54:06.875]  And we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:54:06.895 --> 00:54:10.918]  This will be true warfare, economic, cultural, and then physical.
[00:54:11.518 --> 00:54:14.900]  The rollout of secret police, arrest teams, contact tracers.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.181]  It's all official.
[00:54:16.661 --> 00:54:19.203]  Now everything we've warned of is now out in the open.
[00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:22.185]  Indian towns that refuse the inoculation.
[00:54:23.506 --> 00:54:27.661]  Because the town elders are, there's video throwing out the UN injectors.
[00:54:30.256 --> 00:54:34.738]  They're having their power cut off for not taking the voluntary injections.
[00:54:35.678 --> 00:54:41.440]  And it's all over the news that they're going to start doing similar things here in the United States.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:48.382]  They're announcing, according to your phone number and who you are, they're going to come to your house if you haven't been shot up.
[00:54:48.822 --> 00:54:50.043]  Remember the contact tracers?
[00:54:50.343 --> 00:54:52.143]  Remember the Clinton Global Initiative last year?
[00:54:52.484 --> 00:54:55.505]  Now they're coming to your house because you haven't had the shot.
[00:54:55.765 --> 00:54:58.506]  And in the future, they're going to come and drag your ass out!
[00:54:59.426 --> 00:54:59.646]  Woo!
[00:55:00.731 --> 00:55:07.854]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:55:08.675 --> 00:55:15.718]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:55:17.279 --> 00:55:20.320]  Door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.402]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:55:24.042 --> 00:55:25.443]  They're gonna come and drag your ass!
[00:55:27.083 --> 00:55:27.424]  Alright.
[00:55:29.204 --> 00:55:30.065]  So, here's the deal.
[00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:33.348]  You're a normal person.
[00:55:33.508 --> 00:55:34.428]  You're a black man.
[00:55:34.448 --> 00:55:35.129]  You're a black woman.
[00:55:35.149 --> 00:55:35.789]  You're a white woman.
[00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:37.851]  You're a white man.
[00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:38.571]  You're Hispanic.
[00:55:39.792 --> 00:55:40.933]  You're an Asian man.
[00:55:40.973 --> 00:55:41.533]  You're a human.
[00:55:41.553 --> 00:55:42.313]  You're a human.
[00:55:43.174 --> 00:55:44.995]  And you don't want to go out and dominate people.
[00:55:45.015 --> 00:55:46.636]  So you hear this and you go, that doesn't make sense.
[00:55:47.116 --> 00:55:48.417]  Well, that's because you're not a devil.
[00:55:50.378 --> 00:55:58.704]  And so you better grow up and get out of it and start realizing just because you don't love the devil, the devil hates you.
[00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:05.446]  Just because you're not into all this evil, doesn't mean it doesn't exist, Jack!
[00:56:07.987 --> 00:56:08.708]  It's damn real!
[00:56:11.269 --> 00:56:11.769]  I've seen it!
[00:56:13.429 --> 00:56:17.651]  I asked myself when I was about 15 years old, I said, what the hell are you doing to me, God?
[00:56:19.732 --> 00:56:25.594]  And just like a clear as day in my head, it was like, I'll show you.
[00:56:29.878 --> 00:56:32.480]  And I was never really told what you'll show me what.
[00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:34.222]  I'll show you.
[00:56:35.102 --> 00:56:35.723]  I'm showing you.
[00:56:37.424 --> 00:56:50.536]  And I look back on my life now, and it's like, talk about the Holy Spirit, talk about the sermon, talk about knowing things before they happen, talk about now, all the power I've been given, which I don't even want, but it's so real, it's God gave it all to me.
[00:56:50.896 --> 00:56:52.938]  And then I go back 30 years, 35, 40 years,
[00:56:58.726 --> 00:57:11.060]  And if those things weren't done to me, if I hadn't been victimized, and if I hadn't been attacked, I wouldn't know, down to my cells, what I was dealing with.
[00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:23.132]  And I look back on all that now, and I just feel sorry for all these people that haven't had these experiences, that they have no idea what they've been hit by.
[00:57:24.113 --> 00:57:26.453]  It's like, I know all these languages they don't know.
[00:57:26.973 --> 00:57:28.654]  And the globalists know these languages too.
[00:57:28.914 --> 00:57:30.474]  They use that to control people.
[00:57:31.075 --> 00:57:42.358]  I'm trying to teach people the languages of how the universe works, and they've been taught, oh, don't listen to that, that's evil, oh, you don't want to know information, don't listen to him.
[00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:47.108]  And now I see how the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:57:47.448 --> 00:57:48.589]  I'll cover the news and take your calls.
[00:57:48.609 --> 00:57:50.030]  When I come back, I'll stop preaching.
[00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.731]  It's just that, believe me, God is so real.
[00:57:54.112 --> 00:58:00.715]  Ladies and gentlemen, and you've got free will, and God respects you and is giving you free will, and
[00:58:03.149 --> 00:58:04.710]  You need to join God.
[00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:05.730]  You need to join Christ.
[00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:12.333]  And I'll say to people out there that are already awake, it's your job to go out and warn people and save them, no matter what happens to your body.
[00:58:13.013 --> 00:58:18.256]  Because you may know Jesus, but if you don't put your body in the way of this evil, God is going to say, I don't know you.
[00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:19.296]  That's important.
[00:58:20.197 --> 00:58:20.777]  Think about that.
[00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:31.742]  We are one hour and 20 minutes, 40 seconds in to this live, original, teleprompter-free transmission.
[00:58:33.826 --> 00:58:42.134]  And I have information I'm about to lay on you, that if I built it up for a week, it would actually have a big effect.
[00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:44.977]  But if I just say it now, nobody's gonna care.
[00:58:45.557 --> 00:58:53.485]  Unless you listen to me carefully, and unless you clip this out and put it on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and Gab and Rumble and everywhere else.
[00:58:56.749 --> 00:58:57.709]  What have we been talking about?
[00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:06.053]  Psaki and Biden and Trudeau and Australia and all of them saying, we're coming to forcibly inject you.
[00:59:06.273 --> 00:59:10.255]  We forcibly injected a bunch of school kids without their parents' consent and we don't care.
[00:59:10.275 --> 00:59:11.796]  I played that clip last hour.
[00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:16.558]  And we've got strike teams.
[00:59:16.578 --> 00:59:17.478]  What's the exact quote?
[00:59:17.498 --> 00:59:18.559]  It's right here.
[00:59:20.159 --> 00:59:21.580]  Strike forces.
[00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:32.572]  That are coming to your door to give you this shot that's experimental and they had to put an insert on saying it causes heart attacks.
[00:59:32.912 --> 00:59:35.372]  But you're crazy if you don't take it and you're gonna take it!
[00:59:36.713 --> 00:59:38.533]  But they got a gun to their head to make you take it.
[00:59:40.894 --> 00:59:41.774]  And then we get this.
[00:59:41.834 --> 00:59:45.535]  This bill is heavily sponsored by AOC, all of them.
[00:59:46.696 --> 00:59:48.197]  On the Energy and Commerce Committee?
[00:59:48.737 --> 00:59:50.898]  I know you're probably looking at that as a TV viewer.
[00:59:51.458 --> 00:59:55.760]  Radio listeners can't see the bill, but let me give them the number.
[00:59:56.781 --> 01:00:03.844]  Let he who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. 666.
[01:00:10.424 --> 01:00:17.285]  Yep, you heard me right, heavily sponsored, officially by the Democrats, in the new Congress, H.R.
[01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:33.829]  666, Anti-Racism in Public Health Act 2021, merging, says it right here, health with the Justice Department.
[01:00:34.749 --> 01:00:38.570]  So they got contact tracers and they've got, what does Psaki call it again?
[01:00:39.744 --> 01:00:41.125]  Strike forces?
[01:00:42.586 --> 01:00:43.707]  What New Zealand say?
[01:00:43.987 --> 01:00:45.629]  We're coming to hunt you down.
[01:00:45.989 --> 01:00:46.850]  What Canada say?
[01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:48.151]  We're putting you in a camp.
[01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:49.892]  What the UN say?
[01:00:49.932 --> 01:00:50.452]  They run it.
[01:00:51.053 --> 01:00:51.553]  Same thing.
[01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:54.075]  We're coming to take you out, put you in solitary confinement.
[01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.157]  We're going to give you the modern guillotine.
[01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:58.118]  We're going to intubate you.
[01:00:58.138 --> 01:01:00.000]  Yeah, we'll play that in a minute.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.621]  Dr. Michael Ryan.
[01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:06.525]  It says right here, bigger than Dallas.
[01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:08.787]  My hometown.
[01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.112]  Introducing the House, anti-racism and public health.
[01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:15.032]  Well, we better do it then.
[01:01:15.452 --> 01:01:29.839]  The bill establishes within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that launched this COVID attack, a national center on anti-racism and health and a law enforcement violence prevention program.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:39.164]  Among the activities, the new center will declare racism a public health crisis, collect all and analyze all data
[01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:41.486]  Oh, collect all the data.
[01:01:41.586 --> 01:01:54.057]  Oh, spy and analyze all your health records of the Democrats, the SJWs, to save you from racism and administer research and grant programs to address racism and its impact on health and well-being.
[01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:55.459]  Yeah, they called yesterday.
[01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:58.682]  I was in my stack to ban fireworks displays saying they're racist.
[01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.400]  Austin, two weeks ago, said ban cars.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.201]  Blacks have the most wrecks.
[01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:05.541]  That's not a joke, by the way.
[01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:07.282]  They said birdwatching's racist, too.
[01:02:07.562 --> 01:02:08.663]  French cuisine's racist.
[01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:10.884]  And being white, of course, is inherently bad.
[01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:12.164]  You're like, no, that makes sense.
[01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:13.645]  Yeah, it's a weapon.
[01:02:14.505 --> 01:02:16.966]  Dropping a 2,000-pound bomb on somebody doesn't make sense, either.
[01:02:16.986 --> 01:02:18.167]  Unless you want to kill their ass.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:33.083]  Among other activities, the new center must declare racism a public health crisis, collect and analyze data, and administer research and grant programs to address racism and the impact on health and well-being.
[01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:53.436]  Additionally, the bill specifically directs the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, in coordination with the Department of Justice and other relevant stakeholders, oh, the Department of Justice is in your medical records now, without warrants, to carry out the Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program.
[01:03:03.132 --> 01:03:11.980]  Wow, that's the bill summary from the federal government's own congressional website.
[01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:15.382]  Oh, and it gets better.
[01:03:16.603 --> 01:03:30.155]  They have bills introduced that look like they're going to pass that all children will take part in cultural enrichment drag queen story time, which is your child spends time with a convicted pedophile.
[01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:32.942]  And you're like, whoa, that couldn't happen.
[01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:35.863]  You put up with it, it's going to happen.
[01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:43.966]  But, I mean, never mind the bill number.
[01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:52.949]  Woe to you, of earth and seed, for the devil sends the beast with wrath.
[01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:54.830]  His number is 666.
[01:03:58.285 --> 01:04:00.246]  The bill is 666.
[01:04:00.387 --> 01:04:09.133]  Oh, that old Bible!
[01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.236]  Nostradamus has nothing on you.
[01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:18.140]  And it's all out in the open now.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.263]  All out in the open now.
[01:04:23.104 --> 01:04:25.806]  We're about to reach the halfway point in today's transmission.
[01:04:27.307 --> 01:04:47.421]  And I would like to open the phones up for first-time callers yet again, and three or four callers that were first time we didn't get to yesterday, call them back if you can, so that you can give us your view on the San Francisco Choir saying, let me read the quote, we'll corrupt your kids, we'll take over your kids, we're coming for your kids.
[01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:50.096]  Your kids are ours.
[01:04:50.576 --> 01:04:51.878]  Your kids serve us.
[01:04:52.278 --> 01:04:52.919]  Those are the quotes.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.364]  What's your view on that declaration of war against you and your family?
[01:04:57.625 --> 01:05:00.528]  Because they think you've acquiesced so much that you're going to put up with it forever.
[01:05:04.012 --> 01:05:08.238]  California's legalized pedophilia and having sex with your children and giving them HIV and hepatitis.
[01:05:09.653 --> 01:05:11.113]  What's your view on that?
[01:05:11.133 --> 01:05:18.175]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:18.195 --> 01:05:19.756]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:19.776 --> 01:05:20.216]  877-789-2539!
[01:05:22.897 --> 01:05:24.097]  What is your view on that?
[01:05:26.097 --> 01:05:32.619]  Because in the future, if you want your credits, and the robots run everything, you're going to have to deliver your child to be gang-raped by pedophiles.
[01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:33.980]  And then that won't be enough.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.220]  They'll be like, we want to kill your kid.
[01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:39.602]  Yeah, you're like, okay, I want another year of credit, sure.
[01:05:39.622 --> 01:05:41.183]  I get a private jet?
[01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:41.983]  Yeah, kill him.
[01:05:43.604 --> 01:05:49.266]  And boy, you just signed your ass on to an eternity being separated from God.
[01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:57.310]  You know, hell is people being interfaced with God and seeing what hell looks like.
[01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.090]  God didn't do that.
[01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:01.736]  Hell is a separation from God.
[01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:05.517]  And so somebody that gets, God goes, here let me show you what this looks like.
[01:06:05.577 --> 01:06:07.037]  Ah, this looks like I'm burning to death.
[01:06:07.077 --> 01:06:08.618]  Yeah, that's separation from goodness.
[01:06:10.638 --> 01:06:13.539]  Mama's embrace is warm and sweet and good.
[01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:16.940]  You go to sleep, listen to her heartbeat, it just, it's like you're in heaven.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:24.901]  Can you imagine being separated from God, but that's like, being lowered into a moat of flame.
[01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:28.502]  Being lowered into lava must be enjoyable comparatively.
[01:06:29.377 --> 01:06:32.359]  Imagine being locked up for a trillion years with Jeff Bezos.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.841]  All right, the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:06:36.861 --> 01:06:46.587]  We're gonna go to Darren and Sebastian and Soulshine and George and Josh and Jeff and Tyler.
[01:06:54.732 --> 01:06:55.272]  Well, you speak of 666.
[01:06:57.691 --> 01:07:03.075]  I actually covered this in a video we aired earlier from a year ago, but the crew members found it again and brought it to me.
[01:07:04.096 --> 01:07:09.360]  Not just one bill that's 666 to come and take your kids away, but the other bill is 666.
[01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:16.426]  I mean, the enemy chooses that as their darkest desire, what they want to do to you and your family.
[01:07:18.147 --> 01:07:22.851]  But before I go to your calls here on the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday edition, I'm going to tell you a true story.
[01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:29.521]  Because these are all true stories, but sometimes you don't tell a story perfectly, so you lie.
[01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:33.783]  Even though you didn't want to lie, you've got to tell a story perfect.
[01:07:34.504 --> 01:07:37.105]  Because the truth is so hard to get.
[01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:38.666]  You've got to want it.
[01:07:39.026 --> 01:07:39.826]  You've got to need it.
[01:07:40.367 --> 01:07:42.888]  You've got to bow down to it to get it.
[01:07:42.908 --> 01:07:45.429]  Because all I want is the truth.
[01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.670]  Nothing else.
[01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:49.051]  God is truth.
[01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:50.592]  Perfection.
[01:07:51.653 --> 01:07:56.638]  But I am a fallen creature, so even my attempts at truth are gonna fall short!
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.321]  I'm a liar!
[01:08:00.522 --> 01:08:01.784]  I didn't want to lie to you.
[01:08:01.804 --> 01:08:04.547]  I did the best I could to tell you the truth.
[01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:13.034]  Whereas the Brian Williams of the world and the Brian Stelters of the world, they do their best to lie to you.
[01:08:13.434 --> 01:08:17.878]  Can you imagine, like, sitting up here like, let me, how do I lie to people?
[01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:21.780]  Let me, it doesn't even enter my radar.
[01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:23.962]  But again, that's why we're separated from these people.
[01:08:24.942 --> 01:08:25.863]  So let me tell you a true story.
[01:08:27.965 --> 01:08:31.327]  I spend about half my time, and boy, I don't like doing it,
[01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:41.308]  Trying to get money to run this operation, where I could be doing news, where I could be covering issues, where I could be fighting the globalists.
[01:08:41.348 --> 01:08:43.171]  But I know God works in mysterious ways.
[01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:49.879]  Now, after 28 years, because I've been politically active for 30, but on air for over 27 now.
[01:08:54.494 --> 01:08:55.735]  I wouldn't know all about business.
[01:08:55.855 --> 01:08:57.356]  I wouldn't all know about supply chains.
[01:08:57.376 --> 01:08:58.597]  I wouldn't know about banks.
[01:08:59.077 --> 01:09:03.480]  I wouldn't know about employees and human resources and all of it.
[01:09:03.941 --> 01:09:11.526]  If everything was easy, if God just said, well, you're a good guy, so I'm gonna get everything out of your way so you can be on air.
[01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:18.812]  I wouldn't have learned all this other stuff, because I wasn't just supposed to be on air covering these issues.
[01:09:19.512 --> 01:09:35.987]  I wouldn't understand these issues if I hadn't personally done the things I do up until 8 o'clock last night, jacking with deliveries and air conditioners and HR and supplies and breakdowns, which is great!
[01:09:36.247 --> 01:09:37.148]  Like, I'm not bitching!
[01:09:37.989 --> 01:09:39.330]  This is invaluable!
[01:09:43.186 --> 01:09:47.128]  Four hours, conservatively yesterday, jacking with it.
[01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:52.191]  And it hit me today, it's like, that's a blessing, Jones.
[01:09:53.332 --> 01:09:55.153]  That's why you know how all this works.
[01:09:55.533 --> 01:10:00.957]  You're not one of these globalists up here, disconnecting, screwing everybody over, never actually ran a company, just robbed people.
[01:10:01.157 --> 01:10:02.217]  That's how God works.
[01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:06.640]  And that's why they want people disconnected.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.523]  It's why they want people separated from the public.
[01:10:13.519 --> 01:10:16.800]  So that they don't know how the real world works, so they're not real people.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.762]  Remember that famous footage of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1991?
[01:10:24.563 --> 01:10:26.324]  They had scanners for 20 years then.
[01:10:26.644 --> 01:10:28.324]  Hell, every store had them for 20 years.
[01:10:30.345 --> 01:10:35.007]  He's so used to butlers and money and power, which is fine if he hadn't stolen.
[01:10:37.619 --> 01:10:39.840]  That he's in a grocery store and he goes, what's that?
[01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:42.142]  What's that red light shooting out?
[01:10:42.182 --> 01:10:44.303]  They go, well, sir, that scans the barcode.
[01:10:44.664 --> 01:10:46.164]  He didn't even know what it was.
[01:10:47.906 --> 01:10:48.866]  And I know a lot of rich people.
[01:10:48.906 --> 01:10:52.428]  I mean, really rich people that have been billionaires for four or five generations.
[01:10:52.969 --> 01:10:55.731]  And my buddy Anthony calls them space aliens.
[01:10:56.613 --> 01:10:57.934]  Because they're like aliens, folks.
[01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:02.659]  So you got to remember, the people running things are four, five, six generations of money.
[01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:05.722]  They don't even, they never worried about a paycheck.
[01:11:06.082 --> 01:11:07.984]  They never worried about carrying the trash out.
[01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:10.386]  Yeah, there's the footage right there.
[01:11:11.027 --> 01:11:15.131]  They never worried about making that car payment.
[01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:18.975]  They never missed a meal like I did in college.
[01:11:22.139 --> 01:11:24.040]  And they're the ones running things.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.180]  That's why they're so easy to beat.
[01:11:25.641 --> 01:11:28.842]  That's why they want robots to take over things, because they can't control us.
[01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:32.043]  So I'm going to save this and go to your phone calls.
[01:11:34.244 --> 01:11:35.485]  As bad as things are.
[01:11:36.539 --> 01:11:42.881]  And as crazy as all this is, at the end of the day, these globalists are so divorced, not just from God.
[01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:44.702]  Yeah, look at Hillary in an apartment.
[01:11:44.722 --> 01:11:45.602]  She doesn't even know what the hell it is.
[01:11:46.342 --> 01:12:01.667]  They're so divorced from changing baby diapers, and fixing carburetors, and growing corn, and cooking eggs, and washing laundry, and shooping snow, and kicking ass too, by the way.
[01:12:01.687 --> 01:12:03.728]  That's important.
[01:12:05.353 --> 01:12:06.514]  God, it's a lot of fun too, isn't it?
[01:12:07.354 --> 01:12:23.963]  When you get really real, all the games end, somebody thinks they got what it takes, until you start dumping their head in the ground, and then all their talk don't matter no more, because your will is in charge now.
[01:12:26.785 --> 01:12:31.648]  And everything they do is about teaching you not to have that will.
[01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:35.694]  So I've asked this question a thousand times to God.
[01:12:36.494 --> 01:12:44.018]  Why do you make me spend half my time raising money instead of just letting the money flow?
[01:12:44.279 --> 01:12:45.719]  Why is it always just enough?
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:46.720]  It's magic.
[01:12:47.661 --> 01:12:54.545]  I can sit there and be out of money and not know what I'm going to do and all of a sudden the money shows up.
[01:12:55.489 --> 01:12:57.229]  But it's always just enough, like the widow's money.
[01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:01.070]  It's never, oh, there's some big giant thing in my gas tank.
[01:13:01.271 --> 01:13:04.391]  But see, Satan gives his minions trillions of dollars.
[01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:05.932]  Oh, your gas tank's unlimited!
[01:13:06.372 --> 01:13:08.633]  God gives me just enough.
[01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:13.734]  And God moves through you to support us and give us the support just enough.
[01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:15.674]  And I haven't figured out those mysteries yet.
[01:13:15.694 --> 01:13:17.535]  I haven't figured God's brain out yet.
[01:13:19.013 --> 01:13:22.378]  I just know that if I tried to quit, God wouldn't let me do it.
[01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:24.481]  If I tried to walk away, God wouldn't let me do it.
[01:13:24.741 --> 01:13:27.906]  The minute I walked off, there's no getting out of this.
[01:13:30.209 --> 01:13:32.212]  It's just that God keeps you humble.
[01:13:36.138 --> 01:13:52.514]  And wants me to interface with you and explain to you that you're supposed to support this so that this gets out because it's that inner action of you tithing to this operation that God wants to see.
[01:13:52.814 --> 01:13:55.697]  And I haven't figured out why God does that or how it works.
[01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:57.479]  I haven't figured it out.
[01:13:59.915 --> 01:14:05.483]  I just know this, I'll be sitting here going, alright, I'm going to lay off 10 people and I'm going to go ahead and start setting some stuff up.
[01:14:05.784 --> 01:14:06.765]  Ring, ring, ring.
[01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:08.828]  Oh, I'm going to give you a $300,000 donation.
[01:14:08.888 --> 01:14:12.934]  And then I don't lay those people off.
[01:14:13.976 --> 01:14:19.999]  And I'm telling you, that's how crazy it is, at this level, we've now reached together.
[01:14:20.059 --> 01:14:35.568]  So I thank you for your support, and I don't know why God works this way, where we're always right on black and red, right on, right, because, I don't know how, I don't understand, when we've expanded and gotten bigger over the years, but it's always keeping me hungry.
[01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:40.931]  It's always just right there, because, because, because that's the way the universe works.
[01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.437]  And so, I appreciate God keeping me hungry.
[01:14:46.518 --> 01:14:50.741]  And maybe if I had enough funds to run this place, maybe I wouldn't be as strong as I am.
[01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:58.226]  But I don't like getting up here every hour saying, please buy our products, here's a sale, here's a great product, please get it, keep us on air.
[01:14:58.426 --> 01:15:05.190]  Because it's literally always like treading water, like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, with the FBI on our ass and all the rest of the stuff going on.
[01:15:05.511 --> 01:15:07.112]  But that's the way the real universe isn't.
[01:15:07.352 --> 01:15:08.733]  God wants to keep me hungry.
[01:15:10.759 --> 01:15:23.590]  But I just ask you, because I want to give this crew a bonus, I want to hire some more people, to go to m4warstore.com, take advantage of the double patreon points, the free shipping, to get x2, it's about to sell out, to get the other products, because that's what keeps us on the air.
[01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:28.474]  But that's the weird algorithm, because that's not just me and what just happened to happen.
[01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.375]  It's been like this for 30 years.
[01:15:31.936 --> 01:15:37.901]  It's always just enough, because that's how God works.
[01:15:38.922 --> 01:15:39.643]  You're always given
[01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:41.549]  Just enough.
[01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:45.750]  Satan to his minions goes, you've got quadrillion zillion dollars!
[01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:48.251]  You've got unlimited money, Ben Bernanke!
[01:15:48.571 --> 01:15:50.291]  You've got unlimited money, Rothschild!
[01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:54.532]  Everybody's been asking me about the assassination of the Haitian president.
[01:15:55.272 --> 01:15:56.252]  Well, I looked it up.
[01:15:57.573 --> 01:16:03.494]  He was against forced inoculation of that predominantly African island.
[01:16:06.674 --> 01:16:08.955]  And so, he was killed along with his wife.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:12.841]  All right, let me do this.
[01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:23.169]  I want to go to Darren, Jacob, Sebastian, Pete, Soul Shine, Kristen, Dixon, Josh, Tyler, Charles, Forrest, all of you.
[01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.909]  I'm going to get to you.
[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:28.152]  But I've got something really special here in my little paws.
[01:16:30.814 --> 01:16:34.077]  I have three bills.
[01:16:39.079 --> 01:16:40.300]  Introduced by Democrats.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.681]  All about martial law.
[01:16:42.262 --> 01:16:43.783]  All about forced inoculation.
[01:16:45.565 --> 01:16:46.766]  Sponsored by Bill Gates.
[01:16:50.769 --> 01:16:51.970]  For implantable microchips.
[01:16:54.112 --> 01:16:56.094]  And every bill is 666.
[01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:04.644]  And one of them is a Microsoft patent.
[01:17:04.664 --> 01:17:06.666]  Why would you do that?
[01:17:06.686 --> 01:17:07.847]  Well, that's their lucky number.
[01:17:07.907 --> 01:17:09.709]  That's their ace of spades.
[01:17:09.749 --> 01:17:10.690]  That's their calling card.
[01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:11.971]  We're going to cover that next hour.
[01:17:12.592 --> 01:17:15.054]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:17:16.315 --> 01:17:22.742]  Speaking of Haiti, Darren in Indiana, president of Haiti, assassinated, refused to push vaccine.
[01:17:22.802 --> 01:17:23.402]  I saw that.
[01:17:23.843 --> 01:17:24.803]  What do you make of that?
[01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.266]  Well, what I really
[01:17:27.836 --> 01:17:38.546]  What really had me thinking about it is because the rumor that is going around on Instagram is that they saying that before he was assassinated, they called out that it was the DEA.
[01:17:39.006 --> 01:17:41.949]  And they're trying to say that the DEA is who killed him.
[01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:46.533]  And so... Listen, I have no doubt, but it could have been.
[01:17:46.573 --> 01:17:49.315]  It was people saying they were the DEA on the surveillance footage.
[01:17:49.736 --> 01:17:54.060]  So whether they were DEA or somebody posing at us, you know, as the DEA.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:11.586]  And what it made me think about it is, as we're exposing all of this and it's going down, do you think that they'll probably try to set America up in front of the other countries as that this is all our fault, just how they did Germany in total?
[01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:15.508]  That's an interesting point.
[01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:16.308]  Elaborate on that.
[01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:21.310]  It just made me think that if they're saying it's DEA because the people that I
[01:18:21.934 --> 01:18:22.754]  We're good to go.
[01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:48.670]  No, I agree.
[01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.851]  Why would you ever gonna assassinate a president?
[01:18:52.612 --> 01:18:54.372]  Why would you show up and say you're DEA?
[01:18:54.472 --> 01:18:57.333]  And here's some of the surveillance footage for TV viewers.
[01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:00.774]  I think the whole thing's very, very suspicious and I think you're absolutely right, sir.
[01:19:02.895 --> 01:19:03.715]  And thank you.
[01:19:03.755 --> 01:19:08.037]  And the one thing I wanted to add too is I feel like we have to attack the stores more.
[01:19:08.097 --> 01:19:12.218]  Like we have to, like the same way you're branding shirts with the frogs, we have to
[01:19:13.027 --> 01:19:17.910]  The thing with these bankers and some of these corporates, that's really the source of the problem.
[01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:30.877]  We got to, whether it's shirts that say, you know, bankers are drug lords, because, you know, Chase Bank was caught two years ago importing a billion, 1.3 billion worth of cocaine into the U.S.
[01:19:30.997 --> 01:19:32.278]  or just something like that.
[01:19:32.318 --> 01:19:39.462]  That's more something they've been caught for, because when you try to get into all they fund, the politicians and all that, that's where people get lost.
[01:19:39.935 --> 01:19:49.274]  Just something just in the open blatant and when I tell my friends that and people that I openly show them the articles of these companies just getting caught for things.
[01:19:50.139 --> 01:19:56.864]  I've had more friends openly talk about going away from Chase Bank and stuff like that by showing them that these are really the criminals.
[01:19:57.284 --> 01:19:57.904]  No, I hear you.
[01:19:57.944 --> 01:19:58.705]  Great points, brother.
[01:19:58.725 --> 01:20:05.950]  I'm glad you raised that because I wanted to get into the assassination of the Haitian president and his wife and reportedly others.
[01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:09.092]  And the footage looks very suspicious, very bad.
[01:20:09.192 --> 01:20:11.793]  And hell, Biden's so arrogant and so out of control.
[01:20:12.214 --> 01:20:12.594]  Who knows?
[01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:13.374]  It might have been the U.S.
[01:20:13.395 --> 01:20:13.695]  government.
[01:20:14.155 --> 01:20:18.418]  Because their government's basically gone, but it might have probably was another group posing as the U.S.
[01:20:18.438 --> 01:20:20.199]  government, just on average.
[01:20:20.219 --> 01:20:25.402]  And again, on average, you're not going to have the U.S.
[01:20:25.442 --> 01:20:28.224]  government try to do that or dress up and say it's the DEA.
[01:20:28.864 --> 01:20:30.905]  And I watched some of the goons running around out there.
[01:20:30.965 --> 01:20:34.748]  They just didn't quite have the bearing of some of the folks that would do that.
[01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.772]  If they were going to kill the president, they'd drop a bomb on him and say somebody blew the house up.
[01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:42.092]  They'd use a drone.
[01:20:42.633 --> 01:20:43.753]  I just don't see the U.S.
[01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:45.034]  government doing something that obvious.
[01:20:45.734 --> 01:20:46.294]  But who knows?
[01:20:46.354 --> 01:20:47.715]  My God, things are so out of control.
[01:20:48.095 --> 01:20:50.056]  They can pin anything they want on Biden.
[01:20:50.396 --> 01:20:51.617]  So they might as well just go ahead and do it.
[01:20:51.657 --> 01:20:52.897]  So all bets are off.
[01:20:52.917 --> 01:20:54.178]  Their common sense is out the window.
[01:20:54.278 --> 01:20:54.638]  I don't know.
[01:20:55.378 --> 01:20:57.199]  I'm not going to speculate, but we took your call.
[01:20:57.239 --> 01:20:57.519]  Thank you.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.281]  Let's go to Kristen in Pennsylvania.
[01:21:01.781 --> 01:21:03.662]  Says Trump coming back?
[01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:05.523]  And the AI Antichrist.
[01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:05.883]  Welcome.
[01:21:07.281 --> 01:21:08.042]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:21:08.502 --> 01:21:09.243]  I'm good to talk to you.
[01:21:09.263 --> 01:21:09.523]  Go ahead.
[01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:13.367]  Okay, so real quick, I want to make a comment.
[01:21:13.548 --> 01:21:22.297]  I refer to you as Alex Jonah because I know you hate reporting on this stuff and you'd rather run away from it all, but you keep coming back because you're such a great man.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.301]  So, Trump.
[01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:30.984]  We all love him, but we've got to keep in mind that it's not a coincidence that Trump pents trumpets.
[01:21:31.785 --> 01:21:36.388]  It says in the Bible that the trumpets of revelation will sound at God's last trump.
[01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:40.350]  When he comes back is when things are going to get really bad for the world.
[01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.331]  So we need to get ourselves prepared.
[01:21:43.505 --> 01:21:51.151]  And another thing is, I think a lot of people have what is written in Revelation mixed up and confused.
[01:21:51.632 --> 01:21:54.114]  The false prophet isn't going to be some guy.
[01:21:54.314 --> 01:21:56.716]  It's mainstream media is the false prophet.
[01:21:57.296 --> 01:21:58.917]  And the Antichrist is AI.
[01:21:59.438 --> 01:22:03.281]  It says that the Antichrist will be seated in the temple of God.
[01:22:03.301 --> 01:22:05.062]  We are the temple of God.
[01:22:05.683 --> 01:22:09.006]  That's going to happen when Neuralink is implanted into people's brains.
[01:22:09.306 --> 01:22:11.908]  The Antichrist will be in us, the temple of God.
[01:22:14.616 --> 01:22:19.598]  Well, there's no doubt it's religious for the globalists to make us take this shot, which is killing a bunch of people.
[01:22:20.119 --> 01:22:21.199]  But I think that's a side effect.
[01:22:21.219 --> 01:22:22.300]  I think death's a side effect.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:27.162]  There's something else the shot's doing, mutating us, turning us into something new.
[01:22:27.562 --> 01:22:28.663]  This is really religious.
[01:22:28.703 --> 01:22:31.744]  When you look at the globalists pushing it, they get really excited.
[01:22:31.764 --> 01:22:33.485]  And it's not just about killing people.
[01:22:33.805 --> 01:22:35.746]  They're excited about what they think they're doing.
[01:22:35.786 --> 01:22:36.567]  What do you think that is?
[01:22:38.308 --> 01:22:40.749]  They're making us over into the image of the beast.
[01:22:42.034 --> 01:22:45.279]  They're rebuilding the Temple of God, the Third Temple.
[01:22:45.859 --> 01:22:52.689]  I think the First Temple was, um, when people, like, when Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, and they had a spiritual body.
[01:22:53.049 --> 01:22:58.236]  The Second Temple is us, and the Third Temple is man made into machine.
[01:22:58.971 --> 01:22:59.151]  Basically.
[01:22:59.211 --> 01:23:00.913]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[01:23:00.933 --> 01:23:01.313]  It's an honor.
[01:23:22.913 --> 01:23:23.314]  Awesome.
[01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:28.342]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[01:23:29.063 --> 01:23:33.250]  Alpha Power, even at $29k, if you ask my better half.
[01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:34.538]  She loves it.
[01:23:35.318 --> 01:23:36.519]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.420]  So just number one for viewers.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:39.221]  It definitely works.
[01:23:39.321 --> 01:23:39.921]  It's not a joke.
[01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:41.663]  Absolutely.
[01:23:42.543 --> 01:23:51.010]  Number two, I know you were talking about bugs and certain programming for the kids and for us to eat bugs.
[01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:54.132]  And my 10 year old goes to a summer camp.
[01:23:54.876 --> 01:24:03.880]  I won't say the company, but they have an all things bug day coming up in August, including a complete edible bug buffet.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:15.585]  And we've already told them that that's probably not going to happen and don't touch it, but it's just crazy between the pedophilia and the programming of all the different things that they have going on.
[01:24:15.645 --> 01:24:18.346]  It's all about getting us to do things that we are against.
[01:24:19.565 --> 01:24:20.005]  Absolutely.
[01:24:20.085 --> 01:24:23.208]  It's all about getting us to not be repulsed by things we should.
[01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:26.470]  Yeah, in a starvation situation there's some insects humans eat.
[01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:27.231]  Fine.
[01:24:27.991 --> 01:24:30.693]  But it doesn't mean we do it on a routine basis we choose to do it.
[01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:36.177]  Like, I'll tell, I mean, it's a gross story, but I'm sitting there on the toilet yesterday morning at like 6 a.m.
[01:24:36.598 --> 01:24:38.859]  and a damn brown recluse runs onto my foot.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.240]  I thump it, I kill it.
[01:24:40.881 --> 01:24:42.222]  I'm sure as hell not gonna eat it.
[01:24:42.782 --> 01:24:44.443]  You know, a brown recluse can kill your ass.
[01:24:44.944 --> 01:24:47.826]  So just the idea that we're gonna ingest these things is insane.
[01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:54.901]  It's completely disgusting and it's absurd what they're trying to do to our kids and to us.
[01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:57.125]  Well, it's about defiling us.
[01:24:57.165 --> 01:25:01.694]  What do you make of the San Francisco Choir saying, your kids are ours, we're going to have sex with them?
[01:25:02.916 --> 01:25:09.058]  Oh, it's disgusting, and it was one of those things that me and my better half were just watching it when you played it.
[01:25:09.358 --> 01:25:21.722]  And she said, she made the comment, I think everybody in America should have to watch this video, whether they feel like they can't stomach it or not, because it's something that's so important that's happening right now.
[01:25:22.022 --> 01:25:23.022]  Well exactly, that's it.
[01:25:23.262 --> 01:25:25.823]  It's not about acceptance and being nice people.
[01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:26.663]  I'm nice.
[01:25:27.083 --> 01:25:28.083]  They don't want us to accept.
[01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.444]  They want to take us over.
[01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:30.844]  They want our children.
[01:25:30.884 --> 01:25:31.744]  They're pedophiles.
[01:25:32.064 --> 01:25:38.745]  They should leave us alone and we should start saying no to them and boycotting and suing schools and everything they're doing this.
[01:25:39.126 --> 01:25:47.307]  But they've gotten a bunch of Stockholm Syndrome women that run schools predominantly to let all these perverts, sick men in that are really pedophiles.
[01:25:47.947 --> 01:25:49.528]  And so this is the pedophile invasion.
[01:25:49.568 --> 01:25:50.848]  They want our children so bad
[01:25:52.503 --> 01:25:53.744]  They engineered this whole thing.
[01:25:54.725 --> 01:25:57.888]  All right, Forrest, Charles, Josh, Jeff, Jason.
[01:25:59.649 --> 01:26:00.630]  Soul Shine's up next.
[01:26:00.690 --> 01:26:04.153]  Pete, Sebastian, Jacob, Eric, we're getting to all of you.
[01:26:05.895 --> 01:26:10.018]  In hour number three, that is only two minutes away.
[01:26:10.419 --> 01:26:16.044]  And remember, wherever you're listening to us, radio, TV station, or the internet, tell folks to join the broadcast.
[01:26:16.424 --> 01:26:18.266]  The pedophiles recruit, we recruit.
[01:26:19.724 --> 01:26:26.429]  Look, as negative as things are, at least we were aware of what was coming and we're not being caught flat-footed.
[01:26:27.289 --> 01:26:33.574]  But if we simply say no, and speak up, and know that God is there with us at the same time, we can't lose.
[01:26:34.134 --> 01:26:35.235]  Let's move through a lot of your calls.
[01:26:35.255 --> 01:26:36.516]  These are amazing callers so far.
[01:26:36.836 --> 01:26:42.300]  Sebastian in Washington says media manipulation and how it brainwashes families.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:43.161]  Give us your take on that.
[01:26:44.338 --> 01:26:55.385]  Well, let me just say I'm a first time caller and this, what I've had to deal with with my family has been mostly sad, but in a way it's so sad that it actually is funny in a way.
[01:26:55.425 --> 01:27:00.248]  Like, I'll just say I have a background in journalism and broadcasting.
[01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.849]  I studied journalism for three years.
[01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:09.093]  Um, I've done six years as a radio DJ and I kind of learned about the media and why I can't really trust it.
[01:27:09.534 --> 01:27:09.694]  So,
[01:27:10.856 --> 01:27:14.579]  I tried to tell my family, I'm like, look, they're just so brainwashed by the mainstream media.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.582]  Every single thing that they see, they take it to heart.
[01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:19.423]  They sit there, they're at the edge of their seat.
[01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:22.586]  Every time they see, you know, the news, they have to live by it.
[01:27:22.986 --> 01:27:29.571]  I've had some of them, the second that a shot came available, they had to leave a family meeting and run and take it.
[01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:37.858]  And the, the level of manipulation that there, I was around my brother and his fiancee a few months ago.
[01:27:37.898 --> 01:27:39.740]  I had to move out of my house at the time.
[01:27:40.883 --> 01:27:44.125]  And I had to drop what I was doing out of the kindness of my heart to help them.
[01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.586]  This is the kind of craziness that they're doing.
[01:27:47.406 --> 01:27:49.827]  Because I was around them in a near vicinity.
[01:27:52.129 --> 01:28:01.353]  For two weeks after I left their home, my brother called me and complained and said, well, my fiance, because you were around us,
[01:28:01.932 --> 01:28:05.193]  She's going to be wearing a mask around the house for the next two weeks.
[01:28:05.553 --> 01:28:09.814]  Now, this isn't like a BDSM 50 Shades of Grey type mask.
[01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.914]  No, this is a cloth-based diaper.
[01:28:12.154 --> 01:28:16.075]  Sure, but they're all into the hysteria and using it to be a victim.
[01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:20.456]  They're like interfacing with the media and like, oh, it's so cool I'm doing this.
[01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:21.296]  They're idiots.
[01:28:21.957 --> 01:28:25.617]  And I'm going to tell you, I'm sorry if you're a family member, it's not going to end well with that woman.
[01:28:26.037 --> 01:28:28.298]  She is satanically connected to the lie.
[01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:32.723]  Oh yeah, and a total, like, social justice keyboard warrior.
[01:28:32.743 --> 01:28:47.950]  We're like, to the point where, like, if someone goes out in the street and yells, I identify as a duck-billed platypus, and you don't, you do something as anything shy of throwing them a parade with confetti flowing through the air, you're a racist.
[01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.710]  You're a bigot.
[01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:51.531]  You know, you can laugh at her and say she's an idiot.
[01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:52.952]  She's a woman.
[01:28:53.752 --> 01:28:58.075]  And a lot of women rebel against tyranny, but many women, men too, they stock home.
[01:28:58.395 --> 01:29:00.397]  They go, I will join with the authority.
[01:29:01.037 --> 01:29:03.479]  The Japanese are tough folks, but they will go under authority.
[01:29:04.119 --> 01:29:04.640]  It's the same thing.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.242]  She's like, well, the authority says this, and she's just trying to conform.
[01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:15.507]  She, to her, you see, even though it's her own destruction, she's trying to conform to what she believes is victory.
[01:29:16.908 --> 01:29:20.431]  Yeah, and it's just the, I've like, obviously like,
[01:29:21.101 --> 01:29:29.623]  I've been kind of the black sheep of my family, like most of my life, but I'm the one who throughout this whole pandemic was trying to, you know, get the family together and be like, you know what?
[01:29:30.924 --> 01:29:32.684]  We may have our differences, but we are a family.
[01:29:33.124 --> 01:29:35.525]  What really matters is that we should be a family.
[01:29:35.865 --> 01:29:37.285]  Let's treat each other as such.
[01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.846]  But the division has never been worse.
[01:29:40.086 --> 01:29:47.468]  And when these shots first started coming out, like at the beginning of the year, my family said what we should do,
[01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:56.581]  Because we need to gang together and we need to force my 93-year-old grandmother to take the shot the first day it rolls out.
[01:29:56.901 --> 01:30:02.383]  And then when she dies, we fetish it and kind of get off on it a little bit.
[01:30:03.363 --> 01:30:09.625]  Yeah, and Alex, the craziness is, everyone else was like, yes, yes, we need to make her do it.
[01:30:09.785 --> 01:30:10.725]  We need to make her do it.
[01:30:11.818 --> 01:30:18.221]  I am the only one in the family to go, you know, maybe we should let her make a decision on her own.
[01:30:19.301 --> 01:30:20.701]  Oh, I got backlash.
[01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.002]  Like crazy.
[01:30:22.142 --> 01:30:23.122]  I was ridiculed.
[01:30:23.202 --> 01:30:24.383]  I was chastised.
[01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:28.404]  And I was, I was wrong in every way, shape or form.
[01:30:28.444 --> 01:30:29.665]  How dare I open my mind?
[01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.446]  How dare I disagree?
[01:30:32.806 --> 01:30:33.726]  Oh, she took the shot.
[01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:35.727]  They ended up getting her.
[01:30:35.967 --> 01:30:39.549]  I'm the now I'm the only person in my family to not take the shot.
[01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.229]  And
[01:30:41.159 --> 01:30:41.559]  It's crazy.
[01:30:41.619 --> 01:30:43.881]  I have the messages I can even send over the phone.
[01:30:43.901 --> 01:30:45.301]  Hey, brother, they don't respect you.
[01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:46.842]  They're in a hypnotized state.
[01:30:47.342 --> 01:30:48.383]  I still love your family.
[01:30:48.423 --> 01:30:49.404]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[01:30:49.424 --> 01:30:52.385]  I'd move on and create your own family with a woman that knows what's going on.
[01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:53.246]  So sorry to hear that.
[01:30:53.266 --> 01:30:55.447]  Yeah, we'll be right back.
[01:30:55.467 --> 01:30:55.847]  Stay with us.
[01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.128]  More calls in 60 seconds.
[01:30:58.688 --> 01:31:02.871]  All right, let me hit this controversy that I want right back to your phone calls.
[01:31:03.071 --> 01:31:04.151]  Loaded phone lines here.
[01:31:04.612 --> 01:31:06.793]  Soul Shine's up next and so many others.
[01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:12.990]  But it became a big controversy this week with Brian Stelter with almost no viewers.
[01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:20.695]  I mean, literally, they had like a half million viewers on CNN, which is dead last in the TV cable news area.
[01:31:21.316 --> 01:31:23.257]  But on Twitter, they had 20 million views.
[01:31:23.417 --> 01:31:25.139]  On Facebook, they had millions of views.
[01:31:25.699 --> 01:31:32.324]  I mean, it was a huge story this week, but only because they attacked Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones.
[01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:37.088]  And then Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy became these giant laughingstocks.
[01:31:38.345 --> 01:31:42.189]  And I predict this weekend, when they air their show, it'll be even lower ratings.
[01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:45.472]  It's the lowest it's ever been for them.
[01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:54.100]  So, my old friend, who lives here in Austin now, Joe Rogan, waded into this with Adam Curry, the founder of podcasting.
[01:31:55.407 --> 01:31:55.847]  Yesterday.
[01:31:56.908 --> 01:32:09.278]  And defended myself and Tucker Carlson, so I appreciate the defense of reality, but it's got them in full panic mode, because, you know, Joe Rogan's got his average podcast gets watched about 10 million times.
[01:32:09.918 --> 01:32:12.280]  The big ones, 50, 60, 100 million times.
[01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.123]  Now, you think Ryan Stelter can't get a half million viewers.
[01:32:16.583 --> 01:32:21.687]  Imagine the self-appointed CNN, you know, big tech, Time Warner funds him.
[01:32:22.648 --> 01:32:23.849]  He's supposedly God.
[01:32:25.117 --> 01:32:32.386]  And then here's Joe Rogan with, oh, my small show's 10 million, my big show's 80 million, my top show's 150 million.
[01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:36.311]  Oh yeah, I've done Joe Rogan shows with 150 million views.
[01:32:36.591 --> 01:32:37.893]  You count all the different systems up.
[01:32:39.134 --> 01:32:41.357]  Elon Musk is the only one that's got a bigger podcast than me.
[01:32:41.918 --> 01:32:43.159]  He's got 150 million, I got like 110 million.
[01:32:45.074 --> 01:32:49.459]  So, again, people want freedom.
[01:32:49.479 --> 01:32:52.362]  It's not about, I've got 100 million viewers.
[01:32:52.382 --> 01:32:53.343]  It's not about that.
[01:32:53.363 --> 01:32:54.784]  It's about you want freedom.
[01:32:54.824 --> 01:32:55.605]  It's not me.
[01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:57.147]  It's that you want that.
[01:32:57.527 --> 01:32:58.448]  You love freedom.
[01:32:58.488 --> 01:32:59.629]  You're with it.
[01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:00.510]  You get it.
[01:33:01.972 --> 01:33:04.374]  And they want to gaslight and say that's a bad thing.
[01:33:05.776 --> 01:33:06.376]  But it doesn't work.
[01:33:07.619 --> 01:33:19.969]  Because a little Joe Rogan show has 10 million viewers, and a big Joe Rogan show has 70 million viewers, and a hot Joe Rogan show has 100 million viewers, and a record Joe Rogan show has 160 million viewers.
[01:33:20.249 --> 01:33:21.009]  It's all known!
[01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:24.272]  What are you going to do about that?
[01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.514]  When Alex Jones has got 110 million viewers?
[01:33:28.495 --> 01:33:30.177]  Well, you call for it to be shut down, don't you?
[01:33:30.337 --> 01:33:31.758]  Because you can't compete.
[01:33:31.918 --> 01:33:33.159]  Because the people are actually good.
[01:33:33.179 --> 01:33:33.880]  They want the truth.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.802]  So here's Adam Curry and Joe Rogan yesterday.
[01:33:38.712 --> 01:33:41.993]  Everywhere there's all kinds of, it's information war.
[01:33:42.073 --> 01:33:43.153]  I give Alex Jones that 100%.
[01:33:43.893 --> 01:33:46.974]  I've always been jealous of info wars because that's what we're living in.
[01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.914]  It's truly information war.
[01:33:49.795 --> 01:33:53.395]  And this has been waged on us going back to the 60s.
[01:33:53.996 --> 01:33:58.957]  There was a funny thing where Brian Stelter was on CNN comparing Tucker Carlson to Alex Jones.
[01:33:59.037 --> 01:33:59.857]  I saw that this morning.
[01:34:00.077 --> 01:34:09.682]  And they were showing things that Tucker Carlson said versus things that Alex Jones said, and they were like, he said it in such a funny, dismissive way, like, are they bros?
[01:34:10.123 --> 01:34:11.603]  Are they exchanging information?
[01:34:12.084 --> 01:34:22.890]  But what he didn't show by doing this, by pointing out the two things that Alex Jones talked about and Tucker Carlson talked about,
[01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:28.469]  Both men were saying things that are logical.
[01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:41.660]  They're both saying what you said earlier, like there was most likely agent provocateurs that at least had some part in that January 6th invasion of Capitol Hill.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.161]  That's not an outrageous thing to say.
[01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:47.185]  So just by connecting him to Alex Jones,
[01:34:47.745 --> 01:34:54.975]  He's trying to dismiss Tucker Carlson, but what he's not dismissing is the actual veracity of the statements.
[01:34:55.095 --> 01:34:56.257]  Of course not.
[01:34:56.477 --> 01:34:59.721]  But the things that he's saying aren't that outrageous.
[01:35:00.142 --> 01:35:03.246]  What were the things that they pointed out?
[01:35:03.266 --> 01:35:04.107]  See if you can find that.
[01:35:04.828 --> 01:35:06.909]  There's a clip that's online.
[01:35:06.929 --> 01:35:09.070]  It was all about January 6th?
[01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:10.851]  It was several things.
[01:35:11.411 --> 01:35:13.272]  But those things were not outrageous.
[01:35:13.352 --> 01:35:18.494]  It's not like, you know, the 10 dimensional child molesters that are coming through your window in the middle of the night.
[01:35:18.514 --> 01:35:20.354]  You do such a good Alex Jones.
[01:35:20.635 --> 01:35:21.575]  I know the guy forever.
[01:35:22.435 --> 01:35:25.937]  I need like a jingle, you know, an Alex Jones, Adam Curry jingle from you.
[01:35:26.037 --> 01:35:26.617]  I can do it.
[01:35:27.037 --> 01:35:30.418]  I actually play Alex Jones in Sturgill Simpson's album.
[01:35:30.838 --> 01:35:45.043]  Sturgill Simpson's and his most recent album, there's the opening segment a guy gets in the car and he's spinning through the radio dials trying to find something to listen to and there's Alex Jones ranting and raving about the Illuminati and that's me.
[01:35:45.885 --> 01:35:46.586]  Really?
[01:35:46.926 --> 01:35:48.228]  Oh, wow!
[01:35:48.268 --> 01:35:48.908]  You're good, man.
[01:35:48.928 --> 01:35:49.369]  That's good.
[01:35:49.549 --> 01:35:50.030]  That's good.
[01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:51.571]  You got it down.
[01:35:51.972 --> 01:35:52.833]  Okay, so here it is.
[01:35:53.473 --> 01:35:54.995]  This is Oliver Darcy.
[01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:57.077]  Is this smokable?
[01:35:57.097 --> 01:35:57.758]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:02.915 --> 01:36:04.436]  Let's hear what the things are.
[01:36:04.596 --> 01:36:04.976]  Alright.
[01:36:05.436 --> 01:36:05.836]  Go.
[01:36:05.856 --> 01:36:06.697]  Brace it from the beginning.
[01:36:07.657 --> 01:36:07.998]  Emails.
[01:36:08.098 --> 01:36:11.119]  It's not that I think the government... My God, how old is this?
[01:36:11.139 --> 01:36:11.119]  2011.
[01:36:11.839 --> 01:36:14.261]  It is a lie to say there are no risks.
[01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:17.462]  There are risks in everything, including... No, no, no.
[01:36:17.502 --> 01:36:18.743]  Please go back to the beginning.
[01:36:18.763 --> 01:36:19.463]  Go back to the beginning.
[01:36:19.663 --> 01:36:20.564]  No, no, no.
[01:36:21.304 --> 01:36:24.926]  We didn't hear the beginning because he said something in the beginning about them spying on him.
[01:36:25.326 --> 01:36:32.050]  Because Tucker Carlson is saying the government is spying on him and then Alex Jones from a long time ago was saying that they're spying on him.
[01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.590]  So listen to this.
[01:36:33.475 --> 01:36:36.136]  It's not that I think the government spies on me.
[01:36:36.836 --> 01:36:37.876]  It's admitted that they do.
[01:36:38.036 --> 01:36:39.636]  It is a lie to say there are no risks.
[01:36:39.956 --> 01:36:43.217]  There are risks in everything, including in getting a vaccine.
[01:36:43.457 --> 01:36:46.538]  Everybody's got family that got killed or got sick from a vaccine.
[01:36:46.818 --> 01:36:55.560]  So FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, according to government documents.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.800]  It is overwhelming.
[01:36:59.909 --> 01:37:05.566]  The evidence that criminal elements of the federal government provocateurd and staged January 6th.
[01:37:07.463 --> 01:37:08.624]  Okay, pause.
[01:37:09.124 --> 01:37:13.686]  So that, what he just showed, none of that is outrageous.
[01:37:13.806 --> 01:37:22.631]  First of all, we know from Edward Snowden that the NSA has been monitoring emails and everything, so that's a fact.
[01:37:22.871 --> 01:37:24.592]  It's a little different.
[01:37:24.752 --> 01:37:28.113]  They collect everything, and then when they need it, they go in and get it.
[01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:28.634]  Exactly.
[01:37:28.934 --> 01:37:33.616]  But the idea that they're not monitoring Alex Jones is insane, right?
[01:37:33.716 --> 01:37:34.076]  Of course.
[01:37:35.257 --> 01:37:37.900]  Whether or not they're monitoring Tucker Carlson, I don't know.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:38.561]  I don't know.
[01:37:38.821 --> 01:37:41.344]  But we know that they have the ability to do so.
[01:37:41.924 --> 01:37:43.686]  Edward Snowden exposed this.
[01:37:43.967 --> 01:37:45.268]  This is truth.
[01:37:45.528 --> 01:37:46.289]  They've admitted it.
[01:37:46.309 --> 01:37:48.071]  This is why he's living in Russia now.
[01:37:48.091 --> 01:37:49.773]  This is why he's on the run.
[01:37:50.193 --> 01:37:50.894]  So there's that.
[01:37:51.555 --> 01:37:55.839]  Then Tucker Carlson said that there's some risk.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.260]  To the vaccines.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.281]  There is a risk to every medication that people take.
[01:38:00.681 --> 01:38:02.482]  It's a relatively small risk.
[01:38:02.882 --> 01:38:13.704]  Like if a hundred and seventy million people been vaccinated, if it was just one percent died, we would have a million seven hundred thousand deaths from the vaccine.
[01:38:13.724 --> 01:38:14.665]  That's outrageous.
[01:38:14.905 --> 01:38:15.645]  And it's not the case.
[01:38:15.965 --> 01:38:19.349]  So it's a very small risk, relatively.
[01:38:19.689 --> 01:38:20.450]  I don't know.
[01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:21.351]  But hold on.
[01:38:21.371 --> 01:38:22.512]  There's no numbers I can look at.
[01:38:22.552 --> 01:38:23.012]  But hold on.
[01:38:23.513 --> 01:38:24.694]  So that's true.
[01:38:25.054 --> 01:38:26.035]  So what he said is true.
[01:38:26.456 --> 01:38:31.080]  He didn't say that it's a terrible thing, don't get it, it's killing everybody.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:31.741]  It's not what he said.
[01:38:31.941 --> 01:38:33.142]  He said there is a risk.
[01:38:34.056 --> 01:38:39.222]  Alex Jones says everybody knows someone who's died or who's been hurt by the vaccine.
[01:38:39.723 --> 01:38:41.285]  I know people that have had strokes.
[01:38:41.665 --> 01:38:43.587]  I know people that have had adverse reactions.
[01:38:43.868 --> 01:38:45.830]  That's why the VAERS report exists.
[01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:49.575]  Now, do I know that they absolutely got those strokes from the vaccine?
[01:38:49.595 --> 01:38:50.175]  Of course I don't.
[01:38:51.096 --> 01:38:52.357]  There's a lot of correlation.
[01:38:52.377 --> 01:38:53.597]  Does that mean causation?
[01:38:53.637 --> 01:38:54.757]  We don't know.
[01:38:55.318 --> 01:38:57.058]  We don't know what he factually said was not incorrect.
[01:38:57.118 --> 01:38:58.799]  But what he said is not outrageous.
[01:38:58.839 --> 01:39:11.203]  So he's comparing, they're comparing these things in this really weird, disingenuous way to try to make it look like everything that Tucker Carlson is saying is insane because Alex Jones says something as well.
[01:39:11.423 --> 01:39:14.304]  If Alex Jones says drink water and take vitamins,
[01:39:14.744 --> 01:39:16.385]  And I say, drink water, take vitamins.
[01:39:16.425 --> 01:39:17.145]  Am I Alex Jones?
[01:39:17.566 --> 01:39:18.326]  What does that mean?
[01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:21.127]  The other thing that he said was the Capitol Hill thing.
[01:39:21.367 --> 01:39:33.034]  Now, if there are government files, if you could read these government papers that actually do say that there were Asian provocateurs that had something to do with the Capitol Hill attack.
[01:39:33.994 --> 01:39:40.643]  If Alex Jones says that, and Tucker Carlson says that, but yet the fact remains that it's true, who gives a f**k?
[01:39:41.424 --> 01:39:43.046]  And how are they making that connection?
[01:39:43.306 --> 01:39:44.708]  That connection is so weird.
[01:39:45.088 --> 01:39:48.192]  And the connection is just to try to discredit Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:48.452 --> 01:39:49.834]  But this is your news.
[01:39:50.635 --> 01:39:54.296]  This is coming from America's trusted news source.
[01:39:54.336 --> 01:39:55.736]  They know Humanity's Awakening.
[01:39:56.216 --> 01:40:00.858]  The full video of Adam Curry and Joe Rogan is at Infowars.com.
[01:40:00.918 --> 01:40:01.858]  It's also on Spotify.
[01:40:02.358 --> 01:40:03.098]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:40:03.578 --> 01:40:06.659]  I told you, folks, once Joe got free, he was going to be hardcore.
[01:40:06.699 --> 01:40:07.499]  Now you're all seeing it.
[01:40:07.819 --> 01:40:08.919]  I told you six, eight months ago.
[01:40:08.959 --> 01:40:09.680]  I told you a year ago.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:11.100]  And you see it now.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:13.180]  We'll be right back.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.581]  Stay with us.
[01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:19.022]  It's not a confidence game that I'm scared to cover this news.
[01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:22.492]  It's the opposite, I don't feel confident right now.
[01:40:23.553 --> 01:40:25.494]  I'm sitting here with the keys to destiny.
[01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:28.617]  I'm sitting here with the answers to defeat the globalists.
[01:40:29.678 --> 01:40:30.478]  And I feel pathetic.
[01:40:30.499 --> 01:40:32.680]  I don't know what to do.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.445]  I got a loaded phone line, so many incredible souls calling here, like soul shine.
[01:40:39.706 --> 01:40:44.210]  And right here I got patents and bills all named 666, which are the
[01:40:49.178 --> 01:40:50.959]  Corporate filings on our destruction.
[01:40:53.159 --> 01:40:54.580]  And if I cover it, nobody cares.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:56.821]  It's weird.
[01:40:57.181 --> 01:41:05.564]  If I sat here for a month saying, I'm gonna release the ultimate secret, I'm gonna defeat them, I'm gonna annihilate them, and then I did it!
[01:41:05.804 --> 01:41:06.364]  We beat them!
[01:41:08.004 --> 01:41:09.525]  But that doesn't feel like me.
[01:41:10.265 --> 01:41:11.266]  To sit on this.
[01:41:11.786 --> 01:41:13.566]  Like I'm sitting on some egg or something.
[01:41:13.586 --> 01:41:18.108]  I don't know what to do.
[01:41:24.397 --> 01:41:27.840]  You know, if I could, like, cut my fingers off to defeat the Globalists, I'd do it.
[01:41:28.621 --> 01:41:29.342]  Cut my arm off.
[01:41:29.802 --> 01:41:32.104]  I mean, I'd do anything to beat them.
[01:41:32.404 --> 01:41:33.846]  I really do want to beat them.
[01:41:35.167 --> 01:41:36.748]  But see, I can't do that alone, can I?
[01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:39.391]  Because what does it matter if I tell you this?
[01:41:46.097 --> 01:41:47.458]  That's an old Rush Limbaugh thingy there.
[01:41:47.698 --> 01:41:48.139]  God bless him.
[01:41:51.778 --> 01:41:55.360]  I mean, you know, because if I just mention this, nobody gives a damn.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.040]  Nobody cares.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.621]  You know, I've never figured out the Internet.
[01:41:58.901 --> 01:42:00.882]  It decides what to take from the show and make big.
[01:42:04.483 --> 01:42:10.826]  I've just got all these bills with 666 on them and total world government and forced inoculation and taking you and putting you in a FEMA camp.
[01:42:10.846 --> 01:42:11.667]  I mean, it's all right here.
[01:42:12.967 --> 01:42:17.029]  I mean, the Democrats ought to be arrested for creating this.
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.684]  You know, people used to get pomp and circumstance, too.
[01:42:26.984 --> 01:42:30.190]  Like, when I was a little kid, my dad would go, your mom's tired.
[01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:31.412]  She wants us to buy this for the...
[01:42:32.606 --> 01:42:34.687]  Sunday dinner, the neighbors from Overdose go to the grocery store.
[01:42:35.447 --> 01:42:36.528]  And I'd be driving through Dallas.
[01:42:36.568 --> 01:42:38.889]  I'd go, Dad, look, there's spotlights.
[01:42:38.949 --> 01:42:40.330]  That means a movie theater.
[01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:42.051]  That means a new movie.
[01:42:42.091 --> 01:42:42.911]  Can we go to a movie?
[01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:45.412]  Sometimes you go, yeah, let's go out and go see that movie.
[01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:47.433]  One time it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[01:42:47.774 --> 01:42:52.456]  We pull in, I get milk duds and popcorn and a Coca-Cola, and I go in.
[01:42:52.736 --> 01:42:55.077]  We're supposed to go grocery shopping because Mom's tired.
[01:42:55.618 --> 01:42:56.938]  And we didn't do that.
[01:42:56.978 --> 01:43:00.440]  We ran off, me and Dad, and we watched Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:06.990]  There were other times too, like I'd say, Daddy!
[01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:08.811]  That's the big spotlights!
[01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:10.051]  That's a movie!
[01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:11.592]  And he'd say, Oh, that's a car dealership.
[01:43:15.393 --> 01:43:25.877]  But the point is, if we don't make a big deal about this, with all the sea of entertainment and movies and stuff, which they got everybody mesmerized with, they don't wake up.
[01:43:26.238 --> 01:43:26.878]  How do we
[01:43:28.743 --> 01:43:34.908]  Break the trance to get people to care about real stuff that's happening.
[01:43:36.849 --> 01:43:45.916]  I've got two bills and a patent called 666 for a World ID Total Lockdown Martial Law System.
[01:43:47.478 --> 01:43:50.260]  Introduced officially by Nancy Pelosi.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.041]  I mean, this is what they want.
[01:43:55.364 --> 01:43:56.625]  So I ask you again.
[01:43:59.264 --> 01:44:03.686]  If I read this to you right now, you wouldn't care, and it would have no effect.
[01:44:05.507 --> 01:44:06.147]  So what do I do?
[01:44:08.388 --> 01:44:08.828]  What do I do?
[01:44:10.749 --> 01:44:11.450]  I don't know what I do.
[01:44:13.170 --> 01:44:13.811]  I just know this.
[01:44:16.392 --> 01:44:18.133]  We're in a lot of trouble, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:19.333 --> 01:44:22.155]  So I want to take your calls right now, just in the next 45 minutes.
[01:44:22.855 --> 01:44:24.276]  I want to get to every person that's holding.
[01:44:25.646 --> 01:44:29.687]  Before Jay Dyer takes over in the fourth hour today.
[01:44:31.528 --> 01:44:45.131]  But there's something particularly disgusting about reading the enemy bragging what they're doing to us.
[01:44:51.593 --> 01:44:54.854]  Because I love everybody legitimately.
[01:44:55.814 --> 01:45:00.800]  Hell, I love my cat.
[01:45:02.161 --> 01:45:03.182]  I love my dog.
[01:45:04.083 --> 01:45:04.944]  I love my daughter.
[01:45:05.585 --> 01:45:06.286]  I love my son.
[01:45:06.306 --> 01:45:07.267]  I love my daughters.
[01:45:10.571 --> 01:45:12.413]  I don't need to say I'm not a racist.
[01:45:13.214 --> 01:45:14.015]  I like black people.
[01:45:15.765 --> 01:45:19.028]  It's almost sick to have to say that, oh, I'm not a racist, I really like you.
[01:45:19.388 --> 01:45:25.473]  But do I like you when you say I'm bad because I'm white and you're all in my face and you've been told you can do what you want to me because I'm white?
[01:45:25.773 --> 01:45:34.621]  Now at a certain point it's like, I don't want a war with you because of what color you are, but I'm not going to bow down to you because you're buying into some corporate lie.
[01:45:38.784 --> 01:45:39.685]  And that's really where we're at.
[01:45:40.826 --> 01:45:44.149]  We either transcend this now or we're done.
[01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:46.050]  So I'm going to go to break.
[01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:46.550]  I'll come back.
[01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:48.431]  I'm going to promise I'm going to take every damn caller we got.
[01:45:48.451 --> 01:45:50.131]  I got like 20 people on here.
[01:45:50.851 --> 01:45:55.812]  But Forrest and Charlie and Sol shines up next.
[01:45:56.272 --> 01:45:57.233]  We're going to get to all of you.
[01:45:57.513 --> 01:45:59.013]  And if I don't say this, I won't be here.
[01:45:59.313 --> 01:46:01.374]  So let me go ahead and say this again to everybody.
[01:46:01.754 --> 01:46:02.994]  Plus, these are amazing products.
[01:46:03.254 --> 01:46:07.115]  But let me just go ahead and get this out to everybody right now, because we won't be here if you don't support us.
[01:46:08.666 --> 01:46:10.166]  And I guess that's God's game.
[01:46:10.186 --> 01:46:11.066]  That's how God works.
[01:46:11.246 --> 01:46:15.147]  I haven't figured it out yet, but if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[01:46:16.347 --> 01:46:19.768]  You know, if I had trillions of dollars like the globalists, I'd beat them.
[01:46:19.968 --> 01:46:21.928]  But see, I'm not Satan, so I don't have that, do I?
[01:46:22.488 --> 01:46:23.249]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:46:23.509 --> 01:46:24.229]  I'm not a victim.
[01:46:25.989 --> 01:46:28.429]  I've got the deed to this planet, just like you do.
[01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:37.391]  I got the deed to Jesus Christ and a new soul and a new system and to be forgiven and to transmute all that and go to the next level.
[01:46:40.452 --> 01:46:44.474]  But I still just can't sit back on my laurels and watch all this evil take place.
[01:46:44.675 --> 01:46:45.555]  I've got to take action.
[01:46:46.015 --> 01:46:47.196]  So, it's simple.
[01:46:48.617 --> 01:46:51.359]  I'm sponsored by you, not the Satanists.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:59.183]  You can go to infowarestore.com, right there it says become a sponsor, or you can make a one-time donation, or a regular donation.
[01:47:00.044 --> 01:47:01.385]  You can cancel anytime, it's there.
[01:47:01.705 --> 01:47:03.026]  That funds our operation.
[01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:04.877]  But let me tell you what's happening.
[01:47:04.897 --> 01:47:08.279]  We've got free shipping through this weekend, double pay for your points, and then it's over.
[01:47:08.299 --> 01:47:11.180]  We're not going to have free shipping and stuff till November.
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:19.223]  And we have everything we've got on sale, even though selling out of it means we won't have money in the future.
[01:47:19.243 --> 01:47:22.704]  I'm not bitching, but the breakdown in the supply chain is a problem.
[01:47:24.345 --> 01:47:24.845]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:47:24.865 --> 01:47:25.705]  You've got to get the money in.
[01:47:25.725 --> 01:47:29.467]  So if you've got to sell stuff discounted, even though more is not coming in, you do it.
[01:47:32.694 --> 01:47:33.514]  So here's what you should know.
[01:47:34.235 --> 01:47:40.917]  We have Survival Shield X2, that is the highest quality, pure, deep-earth crystal ionine, at 40% off with free shipping, double pleasure points.
[01:47:42.778 --> 01:47:47.340]  And it's available right now, despite the fact that current sales rates, it'll be sold out within two weeks.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:53.782]  And we have the exact same X2, but with a spray bottle top, for 60% off at $12 a bottle.
[01:47:53.802 --> 01:47:54.762]  It cost us $9 a bottle.
[01:48:02.062 --> 01:48:08.230]  But that's the point I've reached where I'll just sell what I've got, even though I won't have money to buy stuff in the future.
[01:48:08.670 --> 01:48:13.015]  I'll get on the phone, I guess, to a bunch of big donors and beg for money because I'm going to go down swinging.
[01:48:13.416 --> 01:48:14.998]  But this is what's going on.
[01:48:15.518 --> 01:48:17.781]  We have the X2 spray bottle.
[01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:20.905]  We have the X2 dropper bottle.
[01:48:22.347 --> 01:48:25.590]  40 and 60% off with free shipping, double pay, three points.
[01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:29.734]  Lost leaders to fund our operation at Infowarshore.com.
[01:48:29.754 --> 01:48:32.196]  Because listen, how do you think it works in this universe?
[01:48:32.737 --> 01:48:33.758]  I'm not on air.
[01:48:33.998 --> 01:48:37.081]  I'm not here attacking the globalists without support.
[01:48:38.467 --> 01:48:40.008]  And we've got Turbo Force discounted.
[01:48:40.028 --> 01:48:50.637]  We've got Alpha Power, Vasil Beats, Bomb Block, Super Melon Vitality, Biotricillinium, Ultimate Krill Oil, Water Filtration, all of it discounted until Sunday at infowarestore.com.
[01:48:51.397 --> 01:48:53.699]  Look, evil's gonna make its run at humanity.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.963]  And so we look at what's happening and it's totally scary and out of control.
[01:48:58.823 --> 01:49:00.485]  But it's alright, because it's part of God's plan.
[01:49:01.991 --> 01:49:07.433]  I was talking to Owen Schroer, who takes over here in about an hour and a half, and he was just like, what do we do?
[01:49:07.493 --> 01:49:08.574]  How do we respond to this?
[01:49:09.314 --> 01:49:12.235]  At a certain point, you just can't politically even cover the news anymore.
[01:49:12.255 --> 01:49:14.616]  You gotta just cry out to God.
[01:49:14.956 --> 01:49:28.022]  And really, that's what it comes down to, is that we're gonna be faced with political and cultural dilemmas that are so destructive, we're just gonna have to give it to God.
[01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:31.560]  And that's when it becomes metaphysical.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.181]  That's when it becomes spiritual.
[01:49:34.361 --> 01:49:37.882]  It's when you're down and you don't have anything left but God.
[01:49:39.122 --> 01:49:41.602]  And you fire that bat signal up into the universe.
[01:49:42.603 --> 01:49:44.323]  And let me just give you a little news flash.
[01:49:47.544 --> 01:49:48.584]  You do that sincerely?
[01:49:49.804 --> 01:49:50.884]  It's not for some woman.
[01:49:51.105 --> 01:49:52.265]  It's not for your kid to live.
[01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:54.265]  It's not for grandma to get better.
[01:49:55.065 --> 01:49:56.006]  It's for humanity.
[01:49:56.946 --> 01:49:57.746]  God's gonna answer.
[01:49:59.189 --> 01:50:04.111]  The question is, are you ready when those orders come down from the big guy?
[01:50:05.391 --> 01:50:06.531]  You ready to follow those orders?
[01:50:07.932 --> 01:50:08.972]  You ready for that power?
[01:50:10.793 --> 01:50:11.133]  You ready?
[01:50:11.153 --> 01:50:15.754]  To have every cell in your body taken over?
[01:50:15.774 --> 01:50:18.675]  Because the enemy's energized.
[01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:19.616]  They're against our children.
[01:50:20.036 --> 01:50:21.156]  They've already been overtaken.
[01:50:22.356 --> 01:50:25.477]  God didn't trick us like Satan did to turn over our will.
[01:50:26.478 --> 01:50:26.978]  God's like,
[01:50:29.093 --> 01:50:29.993]  I'm ready to take over.
[01:50:33.555 --> 01:50:34.075]  Flip the switch.
[01:50:35.275 --> 01:50:36.236]  But here's what it means.
[01:50:39.857 --> 01:50:40.777]  You ready to flip that switch?
[01:50:45.219 --> 01:50:46.619]  That's a big question everybody's gotta ask.
[01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:48.000]  Alright, we got like 20 callers.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.601]  Let's go to Soul Shine in South Carolina.
[01:50:52.561 --> 01:50:53.762]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:50:55.011 --> 01:50:59.413]  Alex, my first time calling in today and my first time making a purchase, too.
[01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:00.293]  We love you.
[01:51:00.333 --> 01:51:02.534]  Go ahead.
[01:51:02.574 --> 01:51:07.697]  Well, for the past, well, since COVID started, I've been tuning in pretty regular, listening.
[01:51:08.577 --> 01:51:10.178]  My husband's been a fan for 20 years.
[01:51:11.238 --> 01:51:14.760]  I'm going to try to be as articulate and... Well, you're on there, sweetheart.
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.041]  You go ahead and talk about it.
[01:51:17.381 --> 01:51:20.483]  I'm going to try to be quick and make it as clear as I can.
[01:51:21.994 --> 01:51:25.255]  For the past few weeks, I've been asking the Holy Spirit a question.
[01:51:26.055 --> 01:51:30.917]  And I have this thing where I don't really trust anyone about Scripture and stuff.
[01:51:30.957 --> 01:51:32.057]  I go straight to the source.
[01:51:32.857 --> 01:51:37.539]  But I usually open up the day with, if there's something you want me to hear, I'm ready to listen.
[01:51:37.579 --> 01:51:40.060]  If there's something you want me to see, I'm ready to see it.
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:42.080]  And I'm upset.
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:50.403]  I'm getting emotional because every now and then you get one little glimpse, and it's so overwhelming, you don't know what to do with it.
[01:51:53.423 --> 01:51:59.849]  So I was listening to you talk about them wanting to just get rid of us, and I agree.
[01:52:02.151 --> 01:52:02.912]  They're after us.
[01:52:02.932 --> 01:52:04.834]  This is the end of Nye, as they say.
[01:52:06.115 --> 01:52:11.139]  But I was wondering, you know, these elites, what's in it for them?
[01:52:11.199 --> 01:52:13.421]  What's it's over and done with?
[01:52:13.461 --> 01:52:14.322]  What's in it for them?
[01:52:14.342 --> 01:52:17.325]  Because there's not going to be... You can't understand that there's slaves to Satan.
[01:52:18.797 --> 01:52:19.397]  But that's it.
[01:52:19.437 --> 01:52:20.558]  They're trying to kill everybody.
[01:52:20.718 --> 01:52:23.979]  Because they believe if they kill people, they get all the wealth.
[01:52:24.539 --> 01:52:25.459]  It's very stupid.
[01:52:26.099 --> 01:52:27.460]  We can build trillions of worlds.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:28.380]  We have unlimited power.
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:31.761]  But they're told, kill everybody and you'll be empowered.
[01:52:32.581 --> 01:52:33.342]  They're just fools.
[01:52:33.362 --> 01:52:34.382]  So I wouldn't worry about them.
[01:52:35.242 --> 01:52:35.922]  Absolutely.
[01:52:36.043 --> 01:52:43.725]  So I pose the question to the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit understands your question better than anybody else and knows how to answer it.
[01:52:44.537 --> 01:52:52.723]  So I was sitting here watching your piece on the little children coming across the border and thinking about how sick and disgusting that was.
[01:52:53.664 --> 01:53:03.771]  And you mentioned, I can't remember now where it is, but you mentioned the engraving or picture of something that says you will have nothing, you will be nothing, and you'll like it.
[01:53:04.591 --> 01:53:05.552]  Yeah, that's Klaus Schwab.
[01:53:06.473 --> 01:53:07.053]  Yeah, okay.
[01:53:07.494 --> 01:53:10.756]  Well, I was sitting there and that picture came to mind.
[01:53:11.847 --> 01:53:14.549]  And I was like, well, Holy Spirit, I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
[01:53:14.569 --> 01:53:15.549]  Just go ahead and speak.
[01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:21.893]  Well, very clearly it said, they're not just for sex.
[01:53:22.374 --> 01:53:23.754]  They're not just to torture.
[01:53:24.295 --> 01:53:29.518]  They're your replacement because they're not going to have to be re-educated.
[01:53:30.218 --> 01:53:31.699]  They'll just be educated.
[01:53:31.719 --> 01:53:35.382]  They'll be put in these places and they'll be taught to be and do.
[01:53:35.462 --> 01:53:36.442]  Oh, the UN admits that.
[01:53:36.482 --> 01:53:38.003]  I thank you for your call, Soul Shine.
[01:53:38.043 --> 01:53:38.343]  Thank you.
[01:53:38.864 --> 01:53:40.625]  That's exactly the admitted plan of the UN.
[01:53:41.337 --> 01:53:43.339]  All right, up next, who's been on the longest now?
[01:53:43.959 --> 01:53:47.042]  That would be Charles in Vegas.
[01:53:48.022 --> 01:53:50.064]  Whites are evil agenda, race baiting.
[01:53:50.545 --> 01:53:51.365]  What do you make of that?
[01:53:51.405 --> 01:53:52.166]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:53:53.167 --> 01:53:59.151]  Well, Alex, I hate to hear you talk the way you talked a few minutes ago, that you don't know what to do and you feel pathetic.
[01:53:59.412 --> 01:54:04.155]  You do know what to do, you do it every day, and you got a little weak there for a minute.
[01:54:04.216 --> 01:54:05.597]  You're like a John Wayne guy.
[01:54:05.637 --> 01:54:06.918]  No, I'm not saying, you're missing what I'm saying.
[01:54:07.972 --> 01:54:10.314]  I'm saying, I am weak, God is strong.
[01:54:10.354 --> 01:54:14.197]  You understand the difference?
[01:54:14.798 --> 01:54:17.920]  John Wayne level patriot American.
[01:54:18.281 --> 01:54:20.943]  I just want to say that it's so obvious what they are doing.
[01:54:21.303 --> 01:54:25.567]  First it was locking up our patriots when they did nothing at the rally.
[01:54:25.947 --> 01:54:29.450]  Then it's race, trying to start a race war all summer.
[01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:33.954]  They're hoping right now, now they're doing the transgender in our face.
[01:54:34.674 --> 01:54:41.317]  But see, nothing worked, so now it's the kids, and they were sure that that would trigger white people going off.
[01:54:42.077 --> 01:54:49.541]  If we ever decided to have a race war, they know that white people from, see, they're thinking like back in the 70s because they're all old fogies.
[01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:54.883]  I mean, in the 70s when there was gay bashing when I grew up, yeah, that would have worked.
[01:54:55.343 --> 01:54:58.845]  And white people would have went out and there would have been murder everywhere.
[01:54:59.185 --> 01:55:00.586]  But see, that's not working anymore.
[01:55:00.626 --> 01:55:01.126]  No, I agree with you.
[01:55:01.166 --> 01:55:06.369]  We're dealing with 90-year-old crazy people like Charlie Munger trying to start a race war.
[01:55:06.729 --> 01:55:09.151]  How do we counter these old demonic pieces of filth?
[01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:13.969]  Well, don't get upset and let them see you get upset about that 666.
[01:55:14.769 --> 01:55:22.655]  It's so obvious that they don't even have the shame or face to be embarrassed for what the people around the world think of them.
[01:55:23.275 --> 01:55:28.599]  They're kind of like twisted minds, and it's all going to be like foam coming out of the ocean.
[01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:30.120]  It's all going to play out.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:37.825]  But the fact of the matter is, as far as the vaccine, the doctors, nurses, and the medical world, them are the disappointments to me.
[01:55:39.106 --> 01:55:47.713]  When you see those, play those videos of people going to school boards for critical race theory against their, you know, in the classroom, there's 20, 50 people.
[01:55:47.993 --> 01:55:49.914]  There should be 20,000 people.
[01:55:50.395 --> 01:55:51.615]  See, America got weak.
[01:55:51.956 --> 01:55:58.961]  These kids are, what, on their knees in the middle of the street, kissing black people's sneakers, apologizing for being white.
[01:55:59.581 --> 01:56:01.362]  That could never be when I grew up.
[01:56:01.682 --> 01:56:08.425]  So if that's what America's really come to, let it fall, let it wash itself out, and that'll be the reset.
[01:56:09.026 --> 01:56:10.086]  That'll be the good reset.
[01:56:10.126 --> 01:56:10.947]  No, I agree.
[01:56:11.027 --> 01:56:15.169]  They know their system's going down, so they call it the reset and act like they did it.
[01:56:16.209 --> 01:56:17.550]  Smartest thing I heard in the last year.
[01:56:18.091 --> 01:56:19.112]  They are falling.
[01:56:19.592 --> 01:56:21.334]  The globalist satanic system is falling.
[01:56:21.754 --> 01:56:25.938]  So they want to make it a race war as a distraction when it's really a human war against them.
[01:56:26.498 --> 01:56:28.260]  And they have discredited themselves.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:29.961]  They are the Great Reset.
[01:56:30.402 --> 01:56:31.943]  Their collapse is the Great Reset.
[01:56:31.963 --> 01:56:34.105]  Their Great Reset isn't our takeover.
[01:56:34.145 --> 01:56:34.686]  It's their fault.
[01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:44.776]  Owen Schroeder had the journalist, or he played the journalist, asking college kids, did they think America is the greatest country in the world?
[01:56:45.136 --> 01:56:46.337]  Half of them said no.
[01:56:46.957 --> 01:56:50.199]  See, this country is a bunch of mush-mouses.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.341]  We had a stronger generation, or I did.
[01:56:53.421 --> 01:56:56.984]  I don't really know how old you are, but I can tell you're a true American.
[01:56:57.564 --> 01:57:00.127]  Yeah, they don't get their power is embracing America that's theirs.
[01:57:00.167 --> 01:57:02.429]  They're being taught to hate their birthright.
[01:57:17.006 --> 01:57:17.286]  I do.
[01:57:17.366 --> 01:57:17.767]  I love you.
[01:57:17.807 --> 01:57:20.089]  I don't want to see you ever... No, I appreciate you, Charles.
[01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:24.033]  Listen, when I get all waxing sad about things, it's not that I'm being a wimp.
[01:57:24.733 --> 01:57:25.915]  It's the opposite of that, brother.
[01:57:25.935 --> 01:57:29.418]  I can act powerful all day and say I'm going to do this and that.
[01:57:29.478 --> 01:57:30.359]  I'm very sad.
[01:57:32.901 --> 01:57:33.762]  But I'm ready for war.
[01:57:34.363 --> 01:57:35.364]  And I'm not going to back down.
[01:57:35.384 --> 01:57:38.687]  So don't take... The thing is, I'm not going to act tough.
[01:57:39.107 --> 01:57:39.327]  Okay?
[01:57:39.908 --> 01:57:40.969]  That's already been done before.
[01:57:44.036 --> 01:57:49.419]  I'm not going to sit here like John Wayne and just on a movie screen just act like everything's not affecting me.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.641]  No, I've already paid a lot.
[01:57:53.002 --> 01:57:53.722]  You have no idea.
[01:57:54.362 --> 01:57:55.183]  I'm happy to do it.
[01:57:59.125 --> 01:58:01.467]  Don't worry if it's war they want, it's war they'll get.
[01:58:02.187 --> 01:58:03.268]  We'll be back in a few minutes more.
[01:58:03.288 --> 01:58:04.289]  Your phone call, stay with us.
[01:58:05.569 --> 01:58:10.873]  We are back live on this Thursday, July 8th transmission.
[01:58:11.813 --> 01:58:12.394]  Forrest!
[01:58:13.663 --> 01:58:14.604]  That was Manzo's name.
[01:58:14.624 --> 01:58:15.664]  He's a great guy.
[01:58:16.465 --> 01:58:17.266]  In Idaho!
[01:58:17.946 --> 01:58:18.767]  You're on the air.
[01:58:18.847 --> 01:58:19.307]  Welcome!
[01:58:21.048 --> 01:58:22.509]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:58:22.529 --> 01:58:23.250]  You hear me okay?
[01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.890]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:24.311]  Thank you.
[01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:25.732]  Alright, great.
[01:58:25.792 --> 01:58:28.294]  Well, I just wanted to call in and give you a couple of facts.
[01:58:28.374 --> 01:58:31.456]  It's very, very truthful.
[01:58:32.617 --> 01:58:40.943]  My dad was stationed at Air Force Base overseas in Japan, and when I was in middle school, they taught us in 7th grade geography
[01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:50.796]  That America was going to be reformed into different territories and they showed us the FEMA map and this was in 1995-96 I believe and
[01:58:54.867 --> 01:58:56.568]  I mean, that's just the truth.
[01:58:56.608 --> 01:58:58.710]  I just wanted to call in and let you know about that.
[01:58:58.730 --> 01:59:01.693]  Yeah, that was before the FEMA maps in 1979.
[01:59:02.633 --> 01:59:08.418]  In 1936, the New York Times had those maps as part of a world government.
[01:59:08.478 --> 01:59:10.520]  Yeah, I've got a copy of that somewhere around the office.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.021]  That's incredible.
[01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:16.765]  So tell folks, so you were in a government training center and they were telling you about FEMA takeover.
[01:59:17.794 --> 01:59:18.835]  Absolutely.
[01:59:19.135 --> 01:59:30.004]  It was in geography class and what was really strange is when the teacher was showing us the map, it's like he was reading our reactions, like he was data mining our reactions almost.
[01:59:30.624 --> 01:59:33.747]  He showed us and it was very, very strange.
[01:59:33.807 --> 01:59:35.208]  I remember it very clearly.
[01:59:35.228 --> 01:59:38.831]  I also wanted to add, now I have a friend
[01:59:39.346 --> 01:59:44.048]  And their grandma, grandpa, and their uncle Wayne got the COVID shot a few weeks ago.
[01:59:44.508 --> 01:59:48.610]  Grandpa died, grandma got a heart attack, and the uncle got a stroke.
[01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:53.152]  Listen to this.
[01:59:53.192 --> 01:59:54.973]  I live in Idaho and I work in Washington.
[01:59:55.433 --> 02:00:02.937]  Now in Washington state, this communist governor Inslee put in a new mandate that if you're not vaccinated, you have to wear a mask.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.222]  And so they're segregating people even more and more and they got all kinds of signs up at my work.
[02:00:09.143 --> 02:00:09.583]  Uh, no.
[02:00:09.683 --> 02:00:12.124]  Oh yeah, they're saying we're going to come arrest you.
[02:00:12.365 --> 02:00:15.066]  Whether it's New Zealand or the U.S., it's the same thing.
[02:00:15.526 --> 02:00:16.667]  Forced inoculation.
[02:00:17.207 --> 02:00:19.629]  Well, hey, I'd rather resist them than be dead.
[02:00:19.649 --> 02:00:20.109]  What do you think?
[02:00:21.425 --> 02:00:22.206]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:00:22.687 --> 02:00:23.728]  It's just crazy.
[02:00:25.531 --> 02:00:28.775]  They got people at my church wearing masks, black masks at church.
[02:00:28.795 --> 02:00:32.159]  I don't know how these people sleep at night thinking they're on the right side of anything.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.822]  It's very, very strange.
[02:00:33.902 --> 02:00:34.783]  They're followers, brother.
[02:00:34.803 --> 02:00:37.426]  Just feel sorry for them and try to wake them up.
[02:00:39.104 --> 02:00:39.444]  Absolutely.
[02:00:39.484 --> 02:00:50.532]  I mean, I give people your DVDs and information way back in the day in 2008, and I have like grown men give it back to me like, hey, I'm divorced, I'm in debt, I can't handle this information.
[02:00:50.572 --> 02:00:51.313]  And that was back in like 2008.
[02:00:52.654 --> 02:01:02.281]  And we're just domesticated and I think... Well, when you watch these slaves, like your governor we just showed, they're just pretending like they're in charge.
[02:01:03.101 --> 02:01:04.422]  They know they're doing evil.
[02:01:04.462 --> 02:01:05.583]  They know they're destroying humanity.
[02:01:05.623 --> 02:01:06.144]  Thank you for us.
[02:01:07.088 --> 02:01:10.692]  All right, up next after you is Jacob.
[02:01:11.572 --> 02:01:12.793]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:01:12.874 --> 02:01:13.614]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:01:15.216 --> 02:01:17.017]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:01:17.078 --> 02:01:18.038]  Great last caller.
[02:01:18.739 --> 02:01:21.422]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:01:22.282 --> 02:01:27.888]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:01:28.689 --> 02:01:31.031]  It's like we're living in the twilight zone, man.
[02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.839]  We're living in a criminal corporate takeover.
[02:01:34.919 --> 02:01:37.999]  The big banks have unlimited money and they've got all these traitors.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:42.700]  I can't believe we deal with all this.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:51.602]  I also wanted to talk about the degenerate transgender story time ordeal you brought up earlier.
[02:01:51.622 --> 02:01:55.683]  The official San Francisco choir says, quote,
[02:01:56.656 --> 02:01:58.097]  We are going to corrupt your children.
[02:01:58.137 --> 02:01:59.098]  We're going to take them over.
[02:01:59.138 --> 02:02:00.899]  We're going to recruit them.
[02:02:01.499 --> 02:02:02.640]  We're coming for your children.
[02:02:04.081 --> 02:02:05.922]  Yeah, it's unbelievable what we put up with.
[02:02:06.982 --> 02:02:11.665]  And I used to stay up for nights thinking about what I should do to punish these monsters.
[02:02:12.486 --> 02:02:15.908]  And then one night God came to me and I was given a dream.
[02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:22.352]  He told me that he would cleanse the evil and that there was a plan, a timeline.
[02:02:23.246 --> 02:02:29.748]  And so I console myself with knowing God's wrath will bring justice, and to not take this into our own hands.
[02:02:30.628 --> 02:02:32.069]  And all we can do is lawsuit.
[02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:35.250]  I too, Jacob, I too, Jacob, have been shown that.
[02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:37.190]  Wow.
[02:02:40.071 --> 02:02:45.173]  Injustice, we're filled with rage when we see transvestites pounce our children on their crotch.
[02:02:46.162 --> 02:02:53.044]  God feels rage too, and as long as we're doing our part to stand against it, God will do his part when it's time.
[02:02:53.344 --> 02:02:58.606]  Yeah, it's all these creepy dads taking their children to a seminal lab of convicted pedophiles.
[02:02:58.626 --> 02:03:00.567]  It's just so satanic.
[02:03:00.927 --> 02:03:07.249]  It's all a big ritual to F your children up, show how good you are, and it's just so sick.
[02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:13.551]  I tune in to your show every day, and I'm listening to
[02:03:14.637 --> 02:03:21.278]  All of this crap going around, and it's demoralizing.
[02:03:21.378 --> 02:03:29.240]  I kind of hope that maybe we can be more upbeat when I listen to your show, because some days I can't even tune in.
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:31.160]  It's just too much to deal with.
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:31.980]  No, I hear you, brother.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:32.760]  I'm the same way.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.021]  But you know, we're going to put the transmission out, and that's the end of it.
[02:03:37.821 --> 02:03:38.221]  Thank you.
[02:03:38.721 --> 02:03:40.422]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:03:40.502 --> 02:03:41.422]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:03:41.442 --> 02:03:41.722]  Go ahead.
[02:03:42.901 --> 02:03:44.382]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:03:45.442 --> 02:03:48.924]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:03:48.964 --> 02:03:53.026]  The X-Tube, which is on sale right now, does wonders.
[02:03:53.106 --> 02:03:54.226]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:03:54.246 --> 02:03:55.567]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:03:55.847 --> 02:03:56.588]  Get off the fence.
[02:03:56.668 --> 02:03:57.388]  Get the product.
[02:03:57.548 --> 02:03:58.608]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:03:58.628 --> 02:04:02.710]  We need everybody in the fight so we can put an end to this madness and take our hands off it.
[02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:03.151]  No, I agree.
[02:04:03.271 --> 02:04:05.552]  Is it not crazy how out in the open it is now?
[02:04:06.584 --> 02:04:07.605]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[02:04:08.886 --> 02:04:26.843]  But the reason I called was Tuesday night I received a phone call in what I believe is phase one of Biden's COVID task force plan here from the Centers for Disease Control wanting to take a survey about my COVID-19 vaccination and any other vaccinations that I may or may not have.
[02:04:29.645 --> 02:04:31.267]  Absolutely, this is all about
[02:04:32.734 --> 02:04:36.537]  Creating, making you a criminal because their PCR test says you're positive.
[02:04:36.877 --> 02:04:38.738]  It's a perfect way to arrest whoever they want.
[02:04:39.759 --> 02:04:43.422]  Yeah, and I think phase two is going to be the contact tracers knocking at the door.
[02:04:43.602 --> 02:04:48.886]  And then phase three is probably going to be, you know, good strike teams or whatever, soccer, all that.
[02:04:50.687 --> 02:04:52.328]  Well, there's no doubt that's their plan.
[02:04:52.388 --> 02:04:55.871]  This is, they want to arrest their political dissidents.
[02:04:56.011 --> 02:04:58.673]  They're going to intubate you and kill you with a,
[02:05:01.488 --> 02:05:03.030]  Intubation, so that's their plan.
[02:05:04.171 --> 02:05:12.541]  Yeah, well, you asked us a couple months ago, Alex, what our line of sanity is, and, you know, I just want to put it out there that mine is absolutely 100% of the vaccine.
[02:05:12.581 --> 02:05:14.243]  I will not be force-inoculated.
[02:05:14.704 --> 02:05:15.304]  I will not.
[02:05:17.707 --> 02:05:18.688]  No, I agree with you, brother.
[02:05:18.708 --> 02:05:19.970]  And, uh...
[02:05:21.479 --> 02:05:24.682]  Look, when you look at Psaki and Biden, they look scared, brother.
[02:05:24.902 --> 02:05:25.583]  These are slaves.
[02:05:26.324 --> 02:05:29.106]  So, as intimidating as this is, take heart.
[02:05:29.727 --> 02:05:30.948]  They know they're losers.
[02:05:30.968 --> 02:05:31.589]  You understand that?
[02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.531]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:33.731 --> 02:05:34.712]  I think they do, too.
[02:05:35.993 --> 02:05:37.575]  Oh, they know they're losers, brother.
[02:05:38.476 --> 02:05:39.116]  They're slaves.
[02:05:40.457 --> 02:05:42.880]  And they're about to execute an operation that will destroy them.
[02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:54.055]  Can you imagine being the FBI when the official national security directive is war with all gun owners, war with all whites, war with all veterans?
[02:05:54.175 --> 02:05:58.577]  I mean, it's designed to destroy the FBI and the police in a war.
[02:05:58.897 --> 02:06:00.378]  Then the Chi comes and the UN come in.
[02:06:00.398 --> 02:06:01.499]  We don't want this civil war.
[02:06:01.939 --> 02:06:02.840]  But they're going to start it.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:04.301]  So we're like, hey, please don't do it.
[02:06:04.561 --> 02:06:05.781]  Please stop.
[02:06:06.042 --> 02:06:07.803]  But they just say, we're lawyers.
[02:06:07.843 --> 02:06:08.443]  We're liberals.
[02:06:08.523 --> 02:06:10.384]  We're going to have war with you like Waco.
[02:06:10.844 --> 02:06:12.245]  Waco times a billion.
[02:06:12.365 --> 02:06:13.386]  And they're just going to do it.
[02:06:14.778 --> 02:06:15.898]  So we're trying to fix it.
[02:06:16.278 --> 02:06:17.258]  We're saying, please stop.
[02:06:17.899 --> 02:06:22.759]  But when you're a leftist liberal lawyer with a machine gun, you want to kill Republicans.
[02:06:22.799 --> 02:06:24.340]  You want to taste man flesh.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:25.760]  You want to make your bones.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.560]  And that's what they're going to do.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.821]  So they metaphysically need this confrontation.
[02:06:32.961 --> 02:06:33.441]  Understand that?
[02:06:38.062 --> 02:06:38.562]  Thank you, Eric.
[02:06:40.903 --> 02:06:42.923]  Let's jam in one more right now.
[02:06:44.633 --> 02:06:46.094]  Let's talk to Pete in New Jersey.
[02:06:46.494 --> 02:06:47.114]  Pete, go ahead.
[02:06:49.436 --> 02:06:49.976]  Hey, Alex.
[02:06:50.676 --> 02:06:51.177]  Can you hear me?
[02:06:51.457 --> 02:06:51.857]  I can.
[02:06:51.877 --> 02:06:55.139]  So I'm going to be as concise as possible.
[02:06:55.179 --> 02:06:58.621]  Let me, you know, because this is an important issue, but let me first say why I love you.
[02:07:00.022 --> 02:07:06.386]  About seven years ago, I was introduced through your show to a preacher who actually led me to Christ.
[02:07:06.846 --> 02:07:08.707]  And so now I have eternal life.
[02:07:08.767 --> 02:07:10.368]  I'm a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:07:10.388 --> 02:07:11.188]  So I thank you for that.
[02:07:11.208 --> 02:07:12.209]  I'll always love you for that.
[02:07:13.038 --> 02:07:21.223]  But I want to talk about this issue of, you know, the LGBT movement, or what the Bible just, you know... The satanic pedophile movement, yep.
[02:07:22.584 --> 02:07:25.806]  Yes, exactly, or what the Bible just calls sodomites.
[02:07:26.046 --> 02:07:38.733]  So, I think it's so important that our verbiage as Christians and in the conservative movement, the patriot movement, what have you, we need to use the verbiage that the Bible uses.
[02:07:39.254 --> 02:07:41.455]  Because the reason that the Bible uses
[02:07:43.383 --> 02:07:51.106]  Because God knew this is how the attack would come.
[02:07:51.126 --> 02:07:54.047]  I used to wonder, why is the Bible so upset with gay people?
[02:07:54.307 --> 02:07:55.147]  Because it's not gay.
[02:07:55.207 --> 02:07:56.768]  It's an attack on the biology.
[02:07:57.048 --> 02:07:58.228]  It's an alien assault.
[02:07:59.769 --> 02:08:06.891]  Well, if you look at the first mention of, we find the first story of a homosexual act in the book of Genesis with
[02:08:07.612 --> 02:08:11.833]  Uh, with Lott and, you know, or I'm sorry, with Noah and his son, Ham.
[02:08:11.953 --> 02:08:17.495]  It's basically someone, um, you know, abusing their... Hold on, don't hang up.
[02:08:17.535 --> 02:08:18.175]  I'll come back to you.
[02:08:18.215 --> 02:08:26.497]  And it's not that we hate anybody, folks, but humans, you know, man and woman coming together and splicing humans is a religious act.
[02:08:27.097 --> 02:08:28.138]  I mean, this is heavy.
[02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:30.178]  This is like hydrogen bombs.
[02:08:31.379 --> 02:08:32.959]  And God doesn't like playing games with us.
[02:08:34.439 --> 02:08:35.880]  All right, Pete in New Jersey.
[02:08:37.116 --> 02:08:39.277]  Finishing up with the quote, gay agenda.
[02:08:39.357 --> 02:08:42.699]  It's a dehumanizing agenda, an anti-human agenda.
[02:08:43.179 --> 02:08:45.660]  We're not attacking people that have been sucked up in this.
[02:08:47.341 --> 02:08:50.862]  They're saying now in national announcements, your children are ours.
[02:08:51.303 --> 02:08:52.163]  We're coming for you.
[02:08:52.203 --> 02:08:53.043]  This is an army.
[02:08:53.424 --> 02:08:55.224]  This is a new colonialism.
[02:08:55.244 --> 02:08:57.806]  This is a system that's conquering the planet.
[02:08:58.146 --> 02:08:59.567]  Even world leaders are saying that.
[02:09:00.327 --> 02:09:02.028]  How do we extricate ourselves from this?
[02:09:03.308 --> 02:09:04.569]  Well, the way you
[02:09:05.663 --> 02:09:18.006]  It's basically, the Bible says, if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and speak my faith, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.
[02:09:18.026 --> 02:09:25.188]  So it actually starts with us, it starts with Christians, and it starts with us getting sin out of our lives and turning to God and praying.
[02:09:25.528 --> 02:09:30.909]  Well that's right, we have to receive the spirit and the transmission of God, not the spirit of the New World Order.
[02:09:32.665 --> 02:09:48.048]  Of course, and so the reason it's such an issue that pertains to everybody in the world, and specifically in, you know, the United States of America where this is so pervasive, and it's like the headquarters of this LGBT agenda being pushed around the world.
[02:09:48.108 --> 02:09:56.410]  I mean, even Donald Trump set off an initiative to basically spread LGBT propaganda around the world.
[02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:59.611]  That was one of his administration's stated goals.
[02:09:59.711 --> 02:10:00.631]  And look how they treated it!
[02:10:01.715 --> 02:10:11.163]  Well, the Bible says when a nation is given over to these abominations, there's a spiritual principle that the land itself will vomit out its inhabitants.
[02:10:12.028 --> 02:10:20.136]  So the problem is, when we put up with this, and when we just, we cower to these bullies, and that's what they always are, in the Bible, they're bullies.
[02:10:20.176 --> 02:10:26.883]  Because a man and a woman is a huge ritual of two different creatures coming together to create a new entity.
[02:10:26.923 --> 02:10:27.624]  This is magic.
[02:10:27.664 --> 02:10:29.045]  This is high art.
[02:10:29.106 --> 02:10:30.887]  This is the highest thing.
[02:10:31.308 --> 02:10:34.451]  You let things get in the middle of that, you create abomination.
[02:10:34.491 --> 02:10:34.951]  Thank you, Pete.
[02:10:35.632 --> 02:10:41.533]  Sly in Texas on the LGBTQP After Kids CDC.
[02:10:41.893 --> 02:10:45.994]  They've declared we're coming for your kids to rape them in national TV shows.
[02:10:46.614 --> 02:10:47.714]  Why are they declaring it?
[02:10:47.754 --> 02:10:49.174]  What do we do about this, Sly?
[02:10:50.335 --> 02:10:52.675]  Well, Alex, God bless you first and foremost.
[02:10:53.135 --> 02:10:54.095]  Fantastic callers.
[02:10:54.155 --> 02:10:55.396]  I hope I can follow up well.
[02:10:57.016 --> 02:11:02.957]  I actually think this might have to be some kind of psyop, like Operation Training or something.
[02:11:03.655 --> 02:11:11.922]  Because it's in everybody's faces, it's everywhere, and I've had several gay friends throughout my life, and none of the gay people I know act that way.
[02:11:11.942 --> 02:11:15.625]  Hello?
[02:11:17.026 --> 02:11:18.788]  I'm right here listening to you, brother, so what's your view?
[02:11:19.809 --> 02:11:20.309]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:24.613]  Um, well, I think it's gotta be some kind of PSYOP or something.
[02:11:25.396 --> 02:11:27.917]  Because it's in everybody's faces.
[02:11:27.977 --> 02:11:28.637]  It's everywhere.
[02:11:28.677 --> 02:11:29.897]  It didn't used to be that way.
[02:11:30.157 --> 02:11:30.797]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:30.837 --> 02:11:32.618]  They go, we're the government.
[02:11:32.678 --> 02:11:33.718]  We're black.
[02:11:34.178 --> 02:11:34.998]  We're gay.
[02:11:35.718 --> 02:11:36.099]  Exactly.
[02:11:36.119 --> 02:11:39.659]  It's not the average gay person that's even pushing all this.
[02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:40.760]  What is it?
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:46.101]  Well, I think Ike did a good video on this years back.
[02:11:46.781 --> 02:11:47.781]  Everything's inverted.
[02:11:48.041 --> 02:11:50.602]  You know, if you spell live backwards, it's evil.
[02:11:51.598 --> 02:11:54.260]  Everything is the opposite of what it's supposed to be.
[02:11:54.321 --> 02:12:00.565]  Our government that's supposed to protect us is harassing patriots that actually are protecting citizens.
[02:12:01.106 --> 02:12:02.927]  The DHS is trying to kill you.
[02:12:03.888 --> 02:12:05.569]  The FDA approves poisons.
[02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:07.431]  The church is going along with Satan.
[02:12:08.732 --> 02:12:11.774]  This is Satan's time on this planet to rule.
[02:12:12.255 --> 02:12:13.636]  Everything's backwards.
[02:12:15.598 --> 02:12:16.839]  And it really is backwards.
[02:12:16.919 --> 02:12:18.900]  I mean, all of it is so transparent.
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:20.420]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:21.181]  Thank you, Sly.
[02:12:21.661 --> 02:12:23.622]  All right, Jason and Dixon.
[02:12:24.982 --> 02:12:26.043]  Not Mason and Dixon.
[02:12:26.143 --> 02:12:27.524]  It's Jason and Dixon.
[02:12:27.564 --> 02:12:28.164]  We're out of time.
[02:12:28.824 --> 02:12:29.525]  Give us your number.
[02:12:29.625 --> 02:12:32.286]  We'll call you back tomorrow when I'm on Friday Live.
[02:12:32.766 --> 02:12:36.848]  But Jay Dyer, great author, great researcher, is about to take over.
[02:12:37.368 --> 02:12:38.329]  Please remember, listeners,
[02:12:39.932 --> 02:12:45.915]  It is a revolutionary act to take clips out of the show and share it on Instagram, and Google, and YouTube, and Twitter.
[02:12:46.215 --> 02:12:46.856]  Keep doing it.
[02:12:46.896 --> 02:12:47.896]  You're having a huge effect.
[02:12:48.256 --> 02:12:48.857]  I salute you.
[02:12:50.237 --> 02:12:51.398]  Go to infowarrestore.com.
[02:12:52.756 --> 02:12:54.157]  We have free Chevy Dole Patriot points.
[02:12:54.197 --> 02:12:55.018]  It ends this weekend.
[02:12:55.418 --> 02:12:56.399]  We have X to the deep earth.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.282]  Halogen, the good iodine.
[02:12:59.722 --> 02:13:00.723]  That's 50% off.
[02:13:00.743 --> 02:13:02.965]  60% off the spray bottle, by the way.
[02:13:03.465 --> 02:13:04.426]  And that funds us.
[02:13:04.466 --> 02:13:05.947]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film.
[02:13:06.368 --> 02:13:07.669]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:09.390]  Great job of the crew so far.
[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:11.252]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[02:13:11.332 --> 02:13:15.215]  Jason and Dixon, like I told you, tomorrow we will get you back on the show.
[02:13:15.615 --> 02:13:16.957]  But get a free American t-shirt.
[02:13:17.657 --> 02:13:21.838]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:22.198 --> 02:13:26.379]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:13:26.399 --> 02:13:29.379]  Today's analysis.
[02:13:29.419 --> 02:13:37.341]  You know, Alex put out a great documentary this last week, a little mini documentary about three evil sites in New York.
[02:13:38.141 --> 02:13:47.283]  And one of those sites relates to books of the elite.
[02:13:49.099 --> 02:13:59.686]  That is the writings of the elite themselves that go into great detail as to how they would conduct the next phase of their business plan to bring in the technocratic global order.
[02:13:59.846 --> 02:14:07.551]  Of course, the magnum opus of that is Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley, but a lot of people don't know that Quigley wrote another book.
[02:14:08.627 --> 02:14:14.250]  He was the professor at Georgetown, the military historian, archivist for the CFR.
[02:14:14.690 --> 02:14:27.977]  His book, Tragedy and Hope, of course, was given to CIA operatives back in the 70s, 60s, Cold War era to help them understand why would we as Western powers be aiding, at times, communists, right?
[02:14:28.017 --> 02:14:30.418]  Doesn't that seem to go against the logic of the Cold War?
[02:14:33.306 --> 02:14:41.488]  apologetic of Tragedy and Hope is geared towards explaining a lot of these kinds of seeming contradictions in the Western approach to the Cold War.
[02:14:41.548 --> 02:14:53.911]  And as we all know, Quigley's whole thesis is that the tragedies were the two world wars in the Cold War and the hope was Western, globalist, capitalist democracy.
[02:14:54.371 --> 02:15:01.333]  Of course, capitalist there means neoliberalism in the sense of crony capitalism, in the sense of
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.241]  Top-down control corporatism, right?
[02:15:05.261 --> 02:15:08.522]  So we're not talking about the older free market model.
[02:15:08.542 --> 02:15:11.222]  We're talking about the control of the oligarchs.
[02:15:12.643 --> 02:15:15.524]  But what a lot of people don't know is that Quigley wrote another important book.
[02:15:15.844 --> 02:15:24.166]  In ways, it was more important than Tragedy and Hope due to a lot of the details that he spilled in terms of who actually ran the global government.
[02:15:24.821 --> 02:15:41.647]  So, while Tragedy and Hope gives you this 1300-page history and kind of apologetic defense of what was going on and why the elite engineered the two World Wars and the Cold War, The Anglo-American Establishment tells you who's behind it.
[02:15:43.407 --> 02:15:51.890]  So, we're going to be going through some of this forgotten classic here, The Anglo-American Establishment, and again, it parallels very well with Alex's documentary.
[02:15:53.354 --> 02:16:07.299]  So it quickly starts off by talking about in the early phases of the 20th century, by about 1920s, the British Empire had come up with a plan that they called the Commonwealth of Nations.
[02:16:08.179 --> 02:16:16.962]  And so this is where we get Chatham Houses, where we get the Clyde and Set, we get these sort of circles of elites and lords who said, all right, look,
[02:16:18.177 --> 02:16:23.081]  British Empire represents the greatest ascent in human evolution, quite literally.
[02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:27.225]  They thought that it was the apex of evolutionary ascent.
[02:16:27.825 --> 02:16:33.730]  And this is tied in, of course, with Darwinism or the adoption of the Darwinistic religion, really.
[02:16:34.091 --> 02:16:38.234]  If you read what Darwinism actually is, it goes back to ancient Hinduism.
[02:16:38.735 --> 02:16:40.176]  You can see then, of course, the British
[02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:42.593]  Preference for the Hindu caste system.
[02:16:43.014 --> 02:16:51.009]  It meshes perfectly with the social Darwinian perspective of how to structure society in this way.
[02:16:52.202 --> 02:16:57.307]  And so, he quickly points out certain figures and thinkers who were kind of the ideologues.
[02:16:57.687 --> 02:17:03.813]  There's John Ruskin, who thought that we should instantiate a global socialism under the British Empire.
[02:17:04.274 --> 02:17:12.442]  There's Toynbee, there's HG Wells, right, these different thinkers who said, let's divide up the world and put it under the aegis of the British Empire.
[02:17:14.483 --> 02:17:19.245]  In fact, Toynbee would be the key to giving us the ideology, or giving them the ideology, I should say.
[02:17:19.805 --> 02:17:40.955]  And by 1938, through this secret society at Oxford, Cambridge, and other schools, through the support of banking elites like the Morgans, the Rothschilds, the Rhodes Trust, the Byte Trust, Lazard Brothers and Company, they had essentially taken over the entire
[02:17:41.795 --> 02:17:44.397]  Intellectual apparatus of the British Empire.
[02:17:45.198 --> 02:17:48.561]  So, this was the dominant force by that time, by the 30s and 40s.
[02:17:49.422 --> 02:18:03.535]  We can see that this will lead to, of course, not just the creation of the League of Nations earlier than that, but it will even lead to the creation of the United Nations by the same power structure, because they're allied with the Rockefeller power structure, the J.P.
[02:18:04.375 --> 02:18:06.698]  Morgan Mellon Carnegie Trust in the U.S.
[02:18:06.998 --> 02:18:08.179]  They're linked together.
[02:18:09.966 --> 02:18:20.756]  But quickly goes on to talk about the fact that by the 1920s, 30s, 40s, they had not just controlled the universities in the UK, but that they'd also gained control of the Church of England.
[02:18:21.817 --> 02:18:29.404]  The whole Anglican apparatus, which was always kind of a tool of the British crown all the way back to, you know, Henry VIII,
[02:18:31.539 --> 02:18:37.682]  They had co-opted the ministers in the church, and this is paradigmatic for the way it works now, right?
[02:18:37.822 --> 02:18:39.502]  Remember that this is not different.
[02:18:39.542 --> 02:18:43.964]  This superstructure, this octopus operates the exact same way now.
[02:18:44.164 --> 02:18:53.588]  They do the exact same thing where they co-opt and buy off churches and religions to be the arms of this global technocratic order.
[02:18:53.908 --> 02:18:58.150]  Now, it's true that we're not under the old British imperial system anymore.
[02:18:58.999 --> 02:19:07.002]  But what the Pax Americana became, as we'll see here in a little bit, was laid out by these Royal Society strategists.
[02:19:08.263 --> 02:19:13.905]  Now, the Royals also birthed this steering committee idea of the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:19:13.945 --> 02:19:18.047]  And this is the Milner Group and all the same people involved in what I'm talking about now.
[02:19:18.447 --> 02:19:27.991]  They set up this idea of, let's have a modern kind of round table of knights or elites who will steer the globe into the liberal world order.
[02:19:29.102 --> 02:19:31.103]  Now you think, well, doesn't that sound good?
[02:19:31.143 --> 02:19:38.225]  Don't we want a free world order where everybody can freely exchange ideas and goods and it's a free market?
[02:19:38.265 --> 02:19:39.386]  No, no, that's not what it means.
[02:19:39.926 --> 02:19:42.387]  You have to understand that this is an inversion.
[02:19:42.587 --> 02:19:46.488]  Most of the time when you see them saying that kind of stuff, it actually means the opposite.
[02:19:47.228 --> 02:19:57.212]  Now, they were at this time in the 20s and 30s, if you read Lord Birkenhead's famous essay in Cosmopolitan, they had already birthed the idea of a technocracy.
[02:19:57.765 --> 02:20:02.868]  Yes, this early, back in the 19-teens, 20s, 30s, people like H.G.
[02:20:02.908 --> 02:20:06.450]  Wells were already kind of forming the future projections.
[02:20:06.691 --> 02:20:09.632]  Everybody knows about Huxley and Brave New World for this group.
[02:20:10.553 --> 02:20:16.417]  So you have to understand it is this group that is the Illuminati, so to speak, a hundred years ago.
[02:20:17.057 --> 02:20:23.961]  And we're going to get into who makes up this group, what the actual structure of this group was, how it functioned, how they recruited people.
[02:20:24.141 --> 02:20:25.062]  It's all in this book.
[02:20:26.795 --> 02:20:35.781]  Now, keep in mind that Cecil Rhodes was, of course, the famous Freemason, and he is sort of the front man at that time for this conspiracy.
[02:20:35.821 --> 02:20:38.723]  You could think of him like the Klaus Schwab of his day.
[02:20:39.203 --> 02:20:49.590]  Now, certainly, Cecil Rhodes was a wealthy, powerful man, but he was more or less, according to biographers of him, John Roberts has a famous biography, essentially an agent of the Rothschilds.
[02:20:50.279 --> 02:21:01.921]  So Cecil Rhodes is nothing more than a front man, a kind of operator like Rhodes or like a Schwab or Gates to essentially set up these kinds of structures in other countries, right?
[02:21:01.961 --> 02:21:10.883]  So they run, they ran a lot of experiments in Africa through the Rhodes Trust and through how they would structure people in terms of camps, right?
[02:21:10.923 --> 02:21:11.683]  The diamond mines.
[02:21:12.503 --> 02:21:16.684]  That's all what was going on in Africa under this structure of the British Empire.
[02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:27.192]  Other famous lords would be people like Lord Alfred Mackinder, Lord Curtis, Lord Lionel Curtis, and they hatched this plan.
[02:21:27.432 --> 02:21:35.935]  Get this, the second chapter of Quigley's book deals with how to infiltrate and co-opt all areas of society.
[02:21:36.076 --> 02:21:37.756]  Now, this is a hundred years ago, okay?
[02:21:38.136 --> 02:21:41.718]  We're not talking about speculating, is there a conspiracy today?
[02:21:41.738 --> 02:21:42.978]  Well, I don't know, maybe.
[02:21:43.258 --> 02:21:44.599]  No, we're talking about a hundred years ago.
[02:21:45.679 --> 02:21:48.000]  They openly talked about it, okay?
[02:21:49.491 --> 02:21:51.633]  They came up with what they call a triple point plan.
[02:21:52.434 --> 02:22:04.264]  The triple point plan, as hatched by Lord Rothschild and Cecil Rhodes, would be to get into every area of public life, mainly education, media, and politics.
[02:22:05.025 --> 02:22:16.475]  If they could control education, media, and politics, and if they could voice that same model in other countries, then the Commonwealth of God model of the British Empire
[02:22:17.193 --> 02:22:19.654]  Could be a truly global government.
[02:22:20.735 --> 02:22:26.017]  So again, remember, the global government plan was hatched over 100 years ago.
[02:22:26.498 --> 02:22:28.439]  Now, yes, there were globalists prior to that.
[02:22:28.779 --> 02:22:30.099]  The Jacobins were globalists.
[02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:33.441]  Immanuel Kant wrote a famous essay calling for globalism.
[02:22:33.801 --> 02:22:37.203]  And every empire in the history of the world was in some degree globalist, right?
[02:22:37.243 --> 02:22:42.225]  But the modern New World Order that we always talk about, it comes from this.
[02:22:42.345 --> 02:22:43.566]  This is a crucial book.
[02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:54.016]  That outlines the whole superstructure, the strategy, the infiltration, co-opting every area of society, and ultimately, yes, to bring in a technocracy.
[02:22:55.016 --> 02:22:56.237]  And you have to read it.
[02:22:56.317 --> 02:22:57.478]  Just go look it up online.
[02:22:57.538 --> 02:23:00.700]  It's called Lord Birkenhead's Essay in Cosmopolitan Magazine.
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:01.961]  I think it was 1919 or 1920.
[02:23:02.361 --> 02:23:04.342]  Way ahead of time.
[02:23:05.443 --> 02:23:06.004]  Stay right there.
[02:23:06.024 --> 02:23:07.344]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:07.565 --> 02:23:09.346]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:09.366 --> 02:23:11.787]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jayson Analysis.
[02:23:11.827 --> 02:23:12.508]  Be sure and support
[02:23:13.075 --> 02:23:13.995]  The InfoWars store.
[02:23:14.435 --> 02:23:17.356]  Go and get all of your supplement needs in the store.
[02:23:17.837 --> 02:23:20.697]  We won't be here unless you support the work that we're doing.
[02:23:21.498 --> 02:23:31.381]  Now, we were talking about the technocratic plans that were already in play back in the teens and twenties on the part of the British Empire, the British Commonwealth.
[02:23:32.425 --> 02:23:41.514]  In fact, one of these characters who was one of the key architects of the League of Nations, which was the sort of nascent plan for global government at that time, was Lord Robert Cecil.
[02:23:41.614 --> 02:23:44.697]  And he was given the Nobel Prize, which is interesting.
[02:23:44.717 --> 02:23:51.022]  So I think we could even speculate that the Nobel Prize was a kind of propaganda joke all the way back then, right?
[02:23:51.423 --> 02:23:56.888]  Because we know that the League of Nations wasn't really about creating a peaceful world order.
[02:23:57.651 --> 02:24:03.054]  It was a monetarist plan to restructure the world and get it into debt.
[02:24:03.254 --> 02:24:05.976]  I mean, that's the key thing here, especially if you read Tragedy and Hope.
[02:24:06.576 --> 02:24:17.863]  When the bankers have these big, you know, Yalta meetings, Marshall Plan meetings, when they have these big meetings to settle the post-war era, it's really to get the future generations into infinite debt.
[02:24:18.624 --> 02:24:22.306]  That's why all these countries have huge deficits, right?
[02:24:22.833 --> 02:24:26.955]  Although wars, oh, we still owe the banking elites for World War II.
[02:24:27.455 --> 02:24:30.417]  So you're in debt for the next several generations.
[02:24:30.477 --> 02:24:37.240]  And that's really the ultimate long-term goal of why wars are so beneficial to banking elites.
[02:24:37.901 --> 02:24:39.822]  And in fact, even famous generals, right?
[02:24:39.922 --> 02:24:43.243]  General Smedley Butler realized this, that war is a racket.
[02:24:43.824 --> 02:24:48.566]  It's merely a kind of business plan for extremely wealthy people.
[02:24:49.924 --> 02:24:54.127]  So the League of Nations, of course, was the brainchild of the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:24:54.187 --> 02:25:06.117]  As we said, we were talking about how they had come up with this triple threat plan to infiltrate the three areas of society, media, education, and politics.
[02:25:06.826 --> 02:25:12.428]  So even at that time, right, they had figured out that let's just have puppet politicians, right?
[02:25:12.448 --> 02:25:16.570]  We don't really have to worry about what they say in terms of their policies.
[02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:18.431]  You let them yap and say what they want.
[02:25:18.911 --> 02:25:19.831]  We'll just buy them off.
[02:25:20.672 --> 02:25:21.612]  And if you print the money.
[02:25:23.007 --> 02:25:33.154]  You control the printing press, right, through the Fiat Federal Reserve banking system, which the Bank of England was one of those Fiat Federal Reserve private banking systems, right?
[02:25:33.274 --> 02:25:34.675]  You can control the politicians.
[02:25:34.736 --> 02:25:37.117]  You can print as much money as you want, buy off whoever you want.
[02:25:39.019 --> 02:25:51.668]  But as they began to infiltrate the education system, and specifically higher education, the elite universities, one of the things they did was recruit from Oxford, Cambridge, All Souls, etc.
[02:25:52.930 --> 02:25:55.091]  And that's what's going on in the UK, right?
[02:25:55.111 --> 02:25:56.252]  There was similar patterns.
[02:25:56.292 --> 02:26:05.818]  Remember, in New York, when Chatham House is set up, Pratt House is set up, you've got the same model going on in the U.S., and this is why the U.S.
[02:26:05.919 --> 02:26:08.760]  elite set up similar steering committees, right?
[02:26:08.961 --> 02:26:15.865]  You get CFR, you get Trilateral Commission, you get the Institute for Pacific Relations by, you know, David Rockefeller, right?
[02:26:16.165 --> 02:26:21.689]  These are the same models, the same strategies and plans being done on both sides of
[02:26:23.112 --> 02:26:23.793]  Both continents.
[02:26:25.554 --> 02:26:42.468]  So, when they had converted enough of the Anglican ministers, when they converted enough of the technocratic, or excuse me, the educational elite, then it became a situation where they wanted to call it literally a secret society.
[02:26:43.509 --> 02:26:46.932]  And believe it or not, this is not, again, this is not a conspiracy book.
[02:26:47.012 --> 02:26:50.174]  This is a classic tome of geopolitics, okay?
[02:26:50.375 --> 02:26:52.036]  Not a conspiracy, just the history of
[02:26:53.103 --> 02:26:55.945]  Geopolitical intrigues by a military historian.
[02:26:56.826 --> 02:27:01.049]  And the third chapter is called The Secret Society of Cecil Rhodes.
[02:27:02.290 --> 02:27:02.490]  Right?
[02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:07.374]  And they said, well, we'll just recruit people into this by giving them scholarships.
[02:27:08.515 --> 02:27:15.280]  So the next generation of the intellectual elite will give them free scholarships.
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.281]  And that's how we'll just control everybody.
[02:27:17.301 --> 02:27:20.684]  And we'll have the key seats in the universities
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.381]  Chaired by people that are part of our system.
[02:27:25.121 --> 02:27:26.841]  Now you think, well how could they pull this off?
[02:27:27.521 --> 02:27:28.202]  How could they do this?
[02:27:28.242 --> 02:27:29.782]  Well, they had a structure.
[02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:34.003]  And in fact Quigley explains and lists the structure.
[02:27:35.624 --> 02:27:44.726]  Now the first thing that will probably surprise you is that they chose the Jesuit order as the model for how to structure the society.
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:48.905]  Now, that doesn't mean that the Jesuits run the New World Order.
[02:27:49.185 --> 02:27:50.527]  The Jesuits play a role.
[02:27:50.547 --> 02:27:58.338]  The Jesuits have for a long time been agents of globalism, been agents of and connected to the CIA.
[02:27:58.378 --> 02:28:00.281]  That's well established, well documented.
[02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:08.924]  And so they play a role, but I don't think the Jesuits as an order are at the top of the pyramid, but they certainly play an important role in globalism.
[02:28:08.964 --> 02:28:13.486]  In fact, Jesuits were the great evangelizers of Darwinism across the world.
[02:28:13.966 --> 02:28:23.991]  So, in a way, they were kind of helping the British Empire in spreading the myth of the Darwinian ethos, that the British Empire was the apex of human evolution.
[02:28:26.212 --> 02:28:29.774]  But Quigley notes that the structure that Cecil came up with
[02:28:30.478 --> 02:28:30.638]  I don't
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:50.936]  He's the head of the Jesuits, and he's called the Black Pope because he's typically had quite a bit of power in the Roman Catholic superstructure, right?
[02:28:51.256 --> 02:29:07.369]  He may not be the Pope in Rome, but he's kind of a secret order or secret head within the Roman Catholic structure, and we've seen, of course, this come to the fore in the last few years through the stepping down of Benedict and the rise of Bergoglio, right, who was a Jesuit.
[02:29:08.770 --> 02:29:11.712]  But what's interesting is that on page 33 Quigley says that
[02:29:12.338 --> 02:29:20.902]  Rhodes and Rothschild hatched a plan to bring America back under the sway of the British Imperium.
[02:29:22.282 --> 02:29:23.003]  This is crucial.
[02:29:23.843 --> 02:29:28.505]  This is why America changed so much throughout the 20th century.
[02:29:29.546 --> 02:29:36.749]  Everybody knows, of course, the Founding Fathers had a very non-interventionist, right, stay-out-of-the-European-wars attitude.
[02:29:37.765 --> 02:29:38.405]  Why was that?
[02:29:38.446 --> 02:29:42.428]  Well, the Founding Fathers knew that this would entangle the U.S.
[02:29:42.488 --> 02:29:54.357]  back in all of those conflicts that would lead to, that would tempt the United States into stepping in as a policeman of the world, as a global actor, as a new imperium.
[02:29:55.117 --> 02:29:57.679]  And as we will see, that's exactly what happened.
[02:29:57.699 --> 02:29:58.580]  We even know who did it.
[02:29:58.620 --> 02:29:59.580]  We know all the people.
[02:30:00.141 --> 02:30:04.024]  We know the British agents who came over and set up the OSS and CIA.
[02:30:04.044 --> 02:30:07.366]  It was all done as planned.
[02:30:08.240 --> 02:30:09.901]  By Rose and Rothschild.
[02:30:10.481 --> 02:30:29.689]  We must bring... Now, it didn't exactly work out as they hoped because, as we know, throughout the 20th century, the British Empire eventually kind of goes bankrupt, fades away, but it prepares the way for the Pax Americana.
[02:30:30.229 --> 02:30:37.172]  So the elites that ran Britain, and we're not talking about the British people, we're talking about the Royal Society, the RIA,
[02:30:38.092 --> 02:30:41.535]  The Milner Group, these people working with the Rothschilds.
[02:30:41.635 --> 02:30:46.359]  Those are the people who said, you know, who cares about the Brit Empire?
[02:30:46.779 --> 02:30:53.584]  We'll just rebrand this as the American Imperium and we'll set up a secret structure.
[02:30:53.604 --> 02:30:56.306]  This is the inner party.
[02:30:57.787 --> 02:31:03.412]  When Orwell talks about an inner party and an outer party, this is it.
[02:31:04.099 --> 02:31:07.320]  And you say, but wait a minute, how can socialism be compatible with all this?
[02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:10.562]  Wasn't Orwell talking about Ingsoc, English socialism?
[02:31:11.022 --> 02:31:16.464]  Yes, Orwell is telling you that they control, the elite control both sides of this.
[02:31:16.804 --> 02:31:24.768]  It doesn't matter whether it's capitalist or whether it's socialist communist, the elite families are above that dialectical fray.
[02:31:25.868 --> 02:31:30.110]  Now there's really people fighting it out between those two sides, but the super rich
[02:31:31.204 --> 02:31:33.966]  They're above that, and they will fund both sides of that conflict.
[02:31:35.407 --> 02:31:42.672]  When we get into the next section, I'm going to show you, according to Quigley, the actual structure of the actual inner party Illuminati.
[02:31:42.972 --> 02:31:44.073]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:44.093 --> 02:31:44.613]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:31:44.893 --> 02:31:46.114]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:46.154 --> 02:31:48.176]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:31:48.196 --> 02:31:55.761]  We want signed copies of my book that breaks down a lot of this material through the lens of Hollywood and pop culture.
[02:31:56.744 --> 02:32:00.467]  Go to Jay's Analysis and then the shop you can find signed copies.
[02:32:00.507 --> 02:32:07.552]  You can also subscribe to my website, get access to the last five years of my lectures that deal with these very topics.
[02:32:07.592 --> 02:32:22.584]  Now, we were talking about the Rhodes-Milner Rothschild plan to utilize a secret society inner structure like that of the Jesuits, and in fact they even went so far as to say that we would like to see the English Imperium supplant
[02:32:23.311 --> 02:32:25.972]  and take over the Roman Catholic religion.
[02:32:26.012 --> 02:32:37.156]  So they actually wanted something modeled on the Vatican and the Roman Catholic superstructure to supplant and take over what that church or that group represented.
[02:32:37.677 --> 02:32:40.478]  Hence again the plan to model it after the Jesuits.
[02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:46.100]  And one example, by the way, that Quigley gets into of the controlled chaos, divide and conquer strategy,
[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:47.160]  I think?
[02:33:16.949 --> 02:33:35.653]  of the Anglo-American establishment was the Society for Psychical Research, and this was founded by many of the members of the Balfour Group, the Milner Group, and the RIIA, and what they wanted to do was utilize
[02:33:36.531 --> 02:33:45.176]  A kind of religion that they could come up with that they thought would be maybe modeled after psychicalism or mesmerism.
[02:33:45.236 --> 02:33:46.757]  That was very popular at this time, right?
[02:33:47.177 --> 02:33:59.625]  And they were hoping to tap into some kind of literally pre-New Age philosophy and esoteric system that they could use as a kind of global religion.
[02:34:00.425 --> 02:34:00.986]  Yes, on page 32.
[02:34:03.154 --> 02:34:11.197]  Quigley talks about how they hoped that they could tap into something that could be a potential global religion that they could run and control.
[02:34:11.677 --> 02:34:21.080]  Again, they had already the Church of England, they had other groups that they had co-opted, and eventually, I believe, they co-opted the Jesuits, even though they modeled themselves on it.
[02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:32.024]  Eventually, this elite, this same power structure, which is more or less kind of what runs things today, even though all these people are dead and gone, their successors run things today.
[02:34:33.163 --> 02:34:35.605]  Now, here's the structure that Quigley gets into.
[02:34:35.625 --> 02:34:46.393]  He says, all right, Rothschild came up with this idea for the Society of the Elect, and this is the secret society inner core that I was mentioning with Cecil Rhodes.
[02:34:46.433 --> 02:34:49.836]  That's what the chapter is talking about, the secret society of Cecil Rhodes.
[02:34:50.596 --> 02:34:55.240]  This inner core would be the top elites amongst the families, lords, right?
[02:34:56.061 --> 02:35:00.124]  And so it's listed at this time, I think back in the 1890s into the early 1900s,
[02:35:04.088 --> 02:35:06.730]  This is the society as drawn up in 1891.
[02:35:07.291 --> 02:35:11.975]  So notice, this secret society was already structured in 1891.
[02:35:13.516 --> 02:35:17.779]  The head of this society would be Rothschilds and Rhodes, right?
[02:35:17.819 --> 02:35:24.665]  So Rothschilds would be kind of the funder, the money behind it, and then the general of this order would be Cecil Rhodes.
[02:35:25.506 --> 02:35:28.728]  Underneath him would be Lord Stead, Lord Brett, and Lord Milner.
[02:35:29.909 --> 02:35:32.912]  Under them would be a circle of initiates called
[02:35:34.343 --> 02:35:37.626]  Well, namely Cardinal Manning.
[02:35:37.686 --> 02:35:44.050]  So here we have a Roman Catholic who's part of this society structure already at this time.
[02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:47.552]  A surprising figure, General Booth of the Salvation Army.
[02:35:47.712 --> 02:35:48.352]  That's an odd one.
[02:35:49.273 --> 02:35:53.095]  Some other lords in this, including Lord Grey and Lord Balfour.
[02:35:53.115 --> 02:35:55.997]  And of course, we all know about Balfour Declaration.
[02:35:56.037 --> 02:36:00.420]  You can see why that plays into this British Imperial strategy as well.
[02:36:01.491 --> 02:36:04.872]  And then outside of these elect would be what they call the helpers.
[02:36:06.272 --> 02:36:07.752]  The Society of Helpers.
[02:36:08.792 --> 02:36:09.012]  Yes.
[02:36:09.632 --> 02:36:10.853]  What is the Society of Helpers?
[02:36:11.353 --> 02:36:26.255]  This is the thousands of academic elites that they would recruit at the universities, the dupes, the idiots, and the patsies who thought that they would be benefiting from this global government.
[02:36:27.016 --> 02:36:28.496]  This was in the 1890s.
[02:36:28.676 --> 02:36:29.436]  You see that they had
[02:36:30.305 --> 02:36:36.251]  They had set up this plan to create, at that time, that's a different Society of Helpers.
[02:36:36.291 --> 02:36:46.442]  This is the inner core of the Society of Helpers that Rothschild and Rhodes had set up that was basically just Cambridge Oxford elites.
[02:36:47.643 --> 02:36:53.409]  So a lot of academic people thought, oh, you know, we're being brought into this great plan.
[02:36:54.410 --> 02:37:04.814]  of Cecil Rhodes, and Lord Rothschild, and Lord Johnston, and Lord Stead, and Lord Brett, Lord Milner, and they're going to set up a great, free, democratic, global government.
[02:37:05.295 --> 02:37:07.556]  And they literally called it the Commonwealth of God.
[02:37:07.576 --> 02:37:10.857]  That's what they thought at that time would be a good kind of spin.
[02:37:11.657 --> 02:37:17.159]  Well, if we call it the Commonwealth of God, then everybody will believe in it, because who wants to go against God, right?
[02:37:17.199 --> 02:37:20.741]  I mean, it was literally that dumb, but it apparently worked pretty well.
[02:37:21.744 --> 02:37:33.475]  Because although this didn't achieve the actual global government in their day, it did lay the plans and the strategies for what would become the global government eventually that we're now dealing with.
[02:37:33.675 --> 02:37:39.160]  That's the key here, is that we are dealing with what this was planning a hundred years ago, this group.
[02:37:40.521 --> 02:37:46.086]  Also obviously important to this would be the intelligence networks, and Quigley covers this in this same chapter, that
[02:37:46.946 --> 02:37:53.651]  That really this society of helpers functions like a kind of British intelligence network, and that's really what it was.
[02:37:53.711 --> 02:38:06.040]  There's another famous historian, Jessica Harlan Jacobs, who wrote a book about the builders of the Empire, and that book is a history of the British Empire's usage of the Freemasonic lodges.
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.745]  And her thesis is just basically that really the British Empire used Freemasonry as a kind of intelligence network.
[02:38:12.765 --> 02:38:13.426]  That's all it was.
[02:38:13.886 --> 02:38:29.619]  If you've never seen the movie, The Man Who Would Be King with Sean Conrad, go watch The Man Who Would Be King and you will see exactly what I'm talking about because those two scallywags are basically British intelligence spies and they just romp around Europe and go into
[02:38:30.439 --> 02:38:33.641]  I think again the Himalayas are somewhere and they set up a cult, right?
[02:38:33.681 --> 02:38:39.244]  So, and Sean Connery passes himself off as the reincarnation of Alexander the Great.
[02:38:40.024 --> 02:38:46.487]  It's a good insight into the Masonic philosophy and how the British Empire used this kind of intelligence apparatus.
[02:38:47.848 --> 02:38:55.952]  But the idea was of course that there would be a global government that would set up, that would be liberal, that would be using the name God, the Commonwealth of God,
[02:38:57.387 --> 02:38:59.548]  And Cecil Rhodes says, well, we're just going to buy everybody off.
[02:39:00.068 --> 02:39:02.469]  Lord Milner says, we're going to use masses of propaganda.
[02:39:03.310 --> 02:39:06.351]  And then Milner said, let's set up a giant welfare system.
[02:39:06.451 --> 02:39:07.511]  This was a key point here.
[02:39:07.551 --> 02:39:13.434]  Lord Milner said, if we can, if we can have everybody on a dole, right?
[02:39:13.754 --> 02:39:21.918]  So they're implementing elements of socialism as well as elements of big banking capitalism, right?
[02:39:22.058 --> 02:39:23.078]  Monopoly capitalism.
[02:39:23.378 --> 02:39:25.159]  Usury is a big part of the system, by the way.
[02:39:26.275 --> 02:39:30.680]  Then they thought they could combine these into a perfect technocratic order.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.062]  What do we see nowadays with China?
[02:39:33.262 --> 02:39:39.669]  China says, we are the apex of the blending of communism and capitalism into the perfect system.
[02:39:40.970 --> 02:39:42.392]  That's nothing new.
[02:39:42.432 --> 02:39:47.457]  That's what John Ruskin and these people were posing a hundred years ago, was that model.
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:40:00.963]  And in fact, they even noted in what's the chapter that's called Milner's Kindergarten, this is Lord Milner's plan to set up these educational brainwashing centers to brainwash people into this, that basically the state is God.
[02:40:02.703 --> 02:40:09.324]  We will create a liberal imperium, a liberal order and a liberal league.
[02:40:10.745 --> 02:40:13.125]  And they even called it liberal imperialism.
[02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:17.446]  Lord Gray formed the Liberal League,
[02:40:18.851 --> 02:40:24.814]  Which was based on liberal imperialism with Lord Milner closely associated with it.
[02:40:25.454 --> 02:40:27.876]  Then, of course, they bought off people in other churches.
[02:40:28.116 --> 02:40:29.817]  The Church of Scotland, right?
[02:40:29.877 --> 02:40:32.638]  The Church of... Then they brought in Canada.
[02:40:32.658 --> 02:40:33.378]  I forgot to mention that.
[02:40:33.398 --> 02:40:34.839]  So, Canada plays a key role in this.
[02:40:34.859 --> 02:40:46.385]  So, Canada was obviously co-opted as one of the commonwealths, brought into this superstructure, and it will actually be an important Canadian intelligence asset who will play a key role in bringing the U.S.
[02:40:46.665 --> 02:40:47.966]  into this power structure.
[02:40:50.498 --> 02:40:59.141]  The Dawes Plan was drawn up by the banks, and that would be another key choke point to bring people into this debt-based banking order.
[02:41:01.222 --> 02:41:10.025]  Lord Curtis is the one, as I said, who came up with this idea to transition the British Empire into the liberal Commonwealth of God.
[02:41:10.045 --> 02:41:16.848]  All right, as we finish up here with the Carol Quigley classic book, Anglo-American Establishment,
[02:41:18.093 --> 02:41:24.376]  Moving on to talk about the function of the state in the liberal imperium was to basically become a kind of quasi-religion.
[02:41:24.697 --> 02:41:35.122]  It would be a religious level status by which people would accept the imperial philosophy that would supplant belief and trust in their own nation states.
[02:41:36.334 --> 02:41:42.816]  Literally, they propagandized this into the mass mind by using all of the outlets that they had bought.
[02:41:42.836 --> 02:41:49.639]  In fact, they had bought most of the media outlets in the UK by the 30s and 40s, including The Times, The Independent.
[02:41:49.699 --> 02:41:54.140]  All of those, The Economist, were owned by the Rothschild-Rhodes-Milner Network.
[02:41:55.621 --> 02:42:01.663]  By these media outlets, they were beginning to inculcate the idea that the Atlanticist goals would be
[02:42:02.239 --> 02:42:26.198]  Disseminated through every outlet, educational media, and it would include the idea of removing the belief in individual sovereignty, getting rid of the idea of the nation-state, getting rid of the idea of family and loyalty to family and God, and supplanting that with loyalty to international ideals through the promotion of generic ideas like freedom.
[02:42:27.159 --> 02:42:28.240]  Just freedom, man!
[02:42:30.032 --> 02:42:37.096]  And there's an amazing section where, uh, you know, I think Quigley wrote this back in the 80s, 81.
[02:42:37.256 --> 02:42:41.339]  I don't know if he wrote that, but my copy has come, came out in 80, 81.
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:53.946]  But, um, what's amazing is that there's a section where they even talk about this, like it is the logical outgrowing of a series of evolution or revolution, right?
[02:42:54.587 --> 02:42:59.630]  Now we know that Aldous Huxley called this the final revolution, right?
[02:43:00.302 --> 02:43:09.908]  And so there's a section where they even talk about the logical process, so-called, of evolutionary thought and evolution as a kind of mystical religion.
[02:43:11.469 --> 02:43:20.235]  And Quigley says, yes, that is the attitude of the British Empire, that they thought it was a logical process of a kind of Luciferian evolution.
[02:43:20.715 --> 02:43:22.316]  Now, he doesn't use the word Luciferian, I do.
[02:43:23.597 --> 02:43:28.280]  But he does talk about, on page 186, the fact that this secret society had, by
[02:43:30.062 --> 02:43:36.544]  The middle of the century basically set up 2,500 Royal Institute for International Affairs members.
[02:43:36.724 --> 02:43:44.725]  There were 100 people in the Milner group and in the Society of Elect being 12 people and in the Society of Elect being run by the top three.
[02:43:45.406 --> 02:43:50.707]  So again, you've got the Lord Rothschild, Rhodes, and Milner, the top three.
[02:43:50.967 --> 02:43:56.248]  Under them, the Society of Elect, 12 people, which is almost kind of a weird version of the Apostles, right?
[02:43:57.154 --> 02:44:09.880]  Under them, the Milner Group, which has 100 people, and they're over the 2,500 members of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, and that's who sets up the American branches of CFR, etc.
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:16.743]  So, this is a real historical entity with an actual structure like a pyramid.
[02:44:16.963 --> 02:44:22.146]  I even drew a little helpful pyramid there to let you know what this is talking about.
[02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:25.281]  And we even know who's behind this.
[02:44:25.521 --> 02:44:30.122]  And we know that they carved up the globe in the 20th century.
[02:44:31.143 --> 02:44:35.123]  They're the people who set up nations like Iraq.
[02:44:35.143 --> 02:44:39.344]  This is the entity that sent T.E.
[02:44:39.404 --> 02:44:41.805]  Lawrence in to divide up Saudi Arabia.
[02:44:42.805 --> 02:44:44.085]  The great British spy T.E.
[02:44:44.105 --> 02:44:44.425]  Lawrence.
[02:44:46.266 --> 02:44:52.587]  So, if you've never seen Lawrence of Arabia, by the way, go watch that Peter O'Toole movie.
[02:44:53.530 --> 02:44:54.791]  It's making the same point, right?
[02:44:54.811 --> 02:44:57.654]  So you get an insight into the way the British Empire functioned.
[02:44:57.674 --> 02:45:00.596]  Now, I mentioned that they were able to co-opt the U.S.
[02:45:00.777 --> 02:45:04.800]  into coming back under this superstructure, particularly at the time of World War II.
[02:45:05.441 --> 02:45:06.242]  And how did this go?
[02:45:06.362 --> 02:45:07.082]  How did this come about?
[02:45:07.102 --> 02:45:12.427]  Well, there was a couple of spies, actually a handful of them, who were very crucial to doing this.
[02:45:12.527 --> 02:45:15.490]  And amazingly, they weren't just unknown spies.
[02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:17.452]  They were actually people involved in Hollywood.
[02:45:18.593 --> 02:45:19.874]  They're called the Irregulars.
[02:45:20.481 --> 02:45:25.024]  Right, so here we have the irregulars, that is people like Roald Dahl, people like Ian Fleming.
[02:45:25.705 --> 02:45:29.387]  Yes, Ian Fleming helped Bill Donovan set up the OSS.
[02:45:30.388 --> 02:45:35.852]  And another important figure from Canada, Canadian intelligence named William Stevenson, codename Intrepid.
[02:45:36.412 --> 02:45:44.498]  So together this coterie of British intelligence assets working for this group that Quigley is talking about, were able to convince
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:59.957]  Our president at the time, it was FDR, right, to help set up this secret inner core of spies and the intelligence security state, right, the National Security Act in 1942.
[02:46:01.994 --> 02:46:07.378]  And oh, we got to do this to protect America against all the, you know, the threats to our freedom.
[02:46:07.438 --> 02:46:17.185]  And the earlier, right, we had already had a co-opting of the banking through Colonel Edwin Mandel House under Woodrow Wilson, right, and the 14 points.
[02:46:17.786 --> 02:46:20.107]  Well, under FDR, it's the four freedoms, right?
[02:46:21.028 --> 02:46:30.215]  So it's the same group that had taken over the Federal Reserve Bank of the country back in 1913 through Colonel House as their agent.
[02:46:31.132 --> 02:46:34.614]  They make another huge move, right, under FDR.
[02:46:34.914 --> 02:46:43.858]  They're setting up the secret deep state national security state, which is again an agent of this entity, okay?
[02:46:44.578 --> 02:46:46.899]  Quigley even goes into the inquiry, right?
[02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:49.020]  The inquiry was already there.
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:49.881]  It was already present.
[02:46:49.921 --> 02:46:56.424]  That was the post-World War I sort of nascent intelligence agency that was forming.
[02:46:57.375 --> 02:46:58.795]  But it's the same people, right?
[02:46:58.815 --> 02:47:09.978]  Part of the inquiry together with these irregulars, these British spies who set up our national security state, which from that point on is the real controlling power of the country.
[02:47:10.178 --> 02:47:10.838]  It's that simple.
[02:47:11.279 --> 02:47:13.179]  It's not draconians.
[02:47:13.259 --> 02:47:15.960]  It's not we have to sit around and speculate about aliens.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.020]  We don't have to wonder.
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:19.041]  I mean, there's a demonic element to it.
[02:47:19.081 --> 02:47:19.341]  Yeah.
[02:47:19.741 --> 02:47:22.581]  But we don't have to wonder who was behind all this.
[02:47:23.122 --> 02:47:24.442]  Who transitioned the country?
[02:47:24.997 --> 02:47:29.699]  From a non-interventionist into a totally globalist, right?
[02:47:30.019 --> 02:47:31.920]  Role-player Pax Americana.
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:33.180]  These people, we know it.
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:34.381]  It's in the books.
[02:47:34.821 --> 02:47:36.501]  There's no mystery here, right?
[02:47:36.521 --> 02:47:37.182]  I don't know.
[02:47:37.302 --> 02:47:38.482]  Maybe there's a conspiracy.
[02:47:38.522 --> 02:47:39.642]  Maybe something's going on.
[02:47:40.263 --> 02:47:40.843]  Who knows?
[02:47:41.223 --> 02:47:42.003]  Who's in this group?
[02:47:42.163 --> 02:47:42.984]  Who's in that group?
[02:47:43.304 --> 02:47:45.345]  They're all part of the same group, right?
[02:47:45.405 --> 02:47:49.306]  The same people that go to CFR, go to the Trilateral Commission, and they go to Bilderberg.
[02:47:50.126 --> 02:47:51.287]  It's just revolving doors.
[02:47:51.347 --> 02:47:54.488]  And in fact, Quigley even has a discussion of revolving door stuff in here.
[02:47:55.945 --> 02:48:01.468]  So this is where we get after World War II and into the Cold War, right?
[02:48:01.728 --> 02:48:12.073]  The purpose of the Cold War is to get the whole world involved now in a new conflict that allows for the erecting of the technocratic infrastructure.
[02:48:12.893 --> 02:48:16.135]  Yes, that's the purpose of the Cold War in the long term, right?
[02:48:16.695 --> 02:48:21.237]  We wouldn't be where we are now with computers everywhere without the Cold War.
[02:48:22.202 --> 02:48:27.425]  And as I always point out, in the middle of Tragedy and Hope, there's an important chapter about the managerial society.
[02:48:28.005 --> 02:48:32.707]  The managerial society, as Quigley said back in the 60s, is the technocratic society.
[02:48:33.368 --> 02:48:36.569]  Quigley said, computers, AI, they will run the world.
[02:48:36.629 --> 02:48:37.730]  They will run your cities.
[02:48:37.850 --> 02:48:38.790]  They'll run your houses.
[02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:40.211]  They'll run your life.
[02:48:41.231 --> 02:48:46.534]  So he knew, and they have had this planned way back then, because Quigley is an agent of these people.
[02:48:46.794 --> 02:48:48.515]  He's an apologist for these people.
[02:48:49.275 --> 02:48:51.815]  And he, oh, it's going to be great, right?
[02:48:51.895 --> 02:48:53.136]  It's going to fix all the problems.
[02:48:53.716 --> 02:48:55.076]  We're going to have to just kill everybody.
[02:48:55.096 --> 02:49:02.057]  He's another, he's a big depopulation advocate, just like all these people, because they adopted the Darwinian Malthusian worldview.
[02:49:03.618 --> 02:49:05.998]  That is the operating system of this worldview.
[02:49:06.958 --> 02:49:09.279]  And it's directly connected to transhumanism.
[02:49:09.359 --> 02:49:17.280]  Again, Lord Birkenhead was talking about transhumanism before Aldous Huxley was, in the teens, in the twenties, the British Imperial
[02:49:17.887 --> 02:49:20.248]  Royal Society structure had already drawn up these plans.
[02:49:23.629 --> 02:49:31.751]  And so what we see playing out is not run by all the same British elites, right?
[02:49:32.171 --> 02:49:33.571]  It's the same power structure.
[02:49:33.611 --> 02:49:39.893]  There are some of the same families involved in this, but now it is passed on to the technocratic elite.
[02:49:42.474 --> 02:49:44.294]  There's still, yes, powerful Rockefellers.
[02:49:44.314 --> 02:49:45.735]  There's still powerful Rothschilds.
[02:49:45.755 --> 02:49:47.255]  There's still powerful families.
[02:49:48.661 --> 02:50:02.813]  Who engaged in this conspiracy 100 years ago, whose same power structure, the inquiry, the OSS, the CIA, those are adjuncts and busybodies for the banking elite.
[02:50:03.734 --> 02:50:05.195]  And that's who runs things now.
[02:50:05.255 --> 02:50:06.837]  That's who set up Silicon Valley.
[02:50:08.098 --> 02:50:09.439]  That's who runs the world almost.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.261]  And that's who we're fighting.
[02:50:11.702 --> 02:50:14.284]  So meanwhile, everybody's distracted by a bunch of politics.
[02:50:14.564 --> 02:50:18.147]  And I'm not saying everybody involved in local politics is bad or anything like that.
[02:50:18.227 --> 02:50:29.297]  But Quigley said a hundred years ago, the politicians are kind of a, you know, punch and Judy show or whatever, like a puppet show or something like that, because these are the real people that nobody actually can ever figure out.
[02:50:29.397 --> 02:50:33.000]  Even though it's publicly in the books, the people can't figure out who runs this stuff.
[02:50:33.675 --> 02:50:35.396]  And it's the same people like Klaus Schwab.
[02:50:35.596 --> 02:50:37.237]  They represent this people, right?
[02:50:38.938 --> 02:50:43.541]  Prince Charles was just on Klaus Schwab's podcast or whatever a few months ago, right?
[02:50:43.581 --> 02:50:47.203]  Talking about how we've got to have this nasty population.
[02:50:47.623 --> 02:50:49.124]  This is the, this is the crew.
[02:50:49.304 --> 02:50:50.084]  This is the group.
[02:50:50.624 --> 02:50:54.847]  It's the same, at least structure of an inner party that Orwell talked about.
[02:50:55.547 --> 02:50:55.747]  Right.
[02:50:56.268 --> 02:51:02.411]  And remember Orwell was talking about English socialism, but the people who ran the system said, we're just going to combine.
[02:51:03.137 --> 02:51:05.759]  The best, well, actually the worst elements, right?
[02:51:05.959 --> 02:51:12.665]  They would say the best, but the worst elements of capitalism and socialism into a third way, which will be the global technocratic government.
[02:51:13.245 --> 02:51:19.890]  And that's why the Cold War was necessary to set up the tech infrastructure across the globe, right?
[02:51:20.311 --> 02:51:25.535]  The spy satellites, which will become this network, right, of interlinked Internet of Things, right?
[02:51:25.555 --> 02:51:27.116]  This all comes out of the Cold War.
[02:51:27.697 --> 02:51:29.578]  And that's what they had planned the whole time.
[02:51:30.939 --> 02:51:31.079]  So,
[02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:33.806]  If you don't know, this is a key book.
[02:51:42.176 --> 02:52:00.633]  For more than a decade, I've been selling little baby Faraday cages for people that want to put their laptops, computers, and iPhones and droids inside a container, where when they travel or go places, hackers are unable to get into their phone, governments, private agencies, the UN are unable to basically track their location.
[02:52:00.713 --> 02:52:05.557]  It's not that we're doing anything wrong, it's that Big Brother uses our location
[02:52:06.278 --> 02:52:09.401]  And uses our personal information against us.
[02:52:09.842 --> 02:52:12.685]  It's the same reason we lock our doors at night and close our blinds.
[02:52:13.306 --> 02:52:15.428]  It's not that we're bad people.
[02:52:16.089 --> 02:52:20.473]  We don't want robbers being able to come up and see what we're doing inside and be able to break in.
[02:52:20.874 --> 02:52:24.698]  It's simple survival precautions that we all take.
[02:52:24.738 --> 02:52:27.781]  Now, for the first decade or so that I sold privacy boxes,
[02:52:27.921 --> 02:52:29.563]  They were a very small part of our sales.
[02:52:29.863 --> 02:52:32.546]  I explained to people that your cell phones were tracking you in live time.
[02:52:32.626 --> 02:52:49.603]  But now because the public's woken up to it, and now because Dictator Biden with the Clintons is running the global initiative with contact traces that are coming door-to-door, and they admit that droids and Apple have merged together and are illegally putting an app on your phone to track you, even if you try to uninstall it, a secret app, it became a bestseller about a year ago.
[02:52:50.323 --> 02:52:54.786]  And we couldn't get the high rated ones anymore that were basically 99% effective.
[02:52:54.846 --> 02:53:01.450]  Because if you park right underneath the cell tower with your cell phone inside one of these Faraday cages, it's still probably going to beam through it.
[02:53:01.831 --> 02:53:05.993]  But if you're not right under a cell tower, I mean right under it, it works 99% of the time.
[02:53:06.033 --> 02:53:07.134]  We have the highest rated.
[02:53:07.194 --> 02:53:09.956]  We finally got big shipments in because of the COVID lockdowns.
[02:53:09.996 --> 02:53:10.916]  We haven't had these for months.
[02:53:11.016 --> 02:53:13.398]  They're in right now for the biggest discount ever.
[02:53:14.359 --> 02:53:16.620]  $14.95 at infowarrestore.com.
[02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:19.843]  The exact same Faraday cake sells all day for $29.95.
[02:53:20.584 --> 02:53:24.066]  We usually discount it for $19.95, but I want you all to get one out.
[02:53:24.086 --> 02:53:28.190]  They're back in stock, ready to ship right now at infowarrestore.com for $14.95, 50% off retail.
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:40.301]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[02:53:40.381 --> 02:53:41.582]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:53:41.623 --> 02:53:42.744]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:53:42.804 --> 02:53:45.666]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to, and Joe Rogan, Elon Musk?
[02:53:45.826 --> 02:53:46.907]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:53:47.187 --> 02:53:50.991]  They tune in right here!
[02:53:51.812 --> 02:53:52.532]  InfoWars.
[02:53:52.912 --> 02:53:54.554]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:53:54.974 --> 02:53:58.477]  We've finally reached the point where viewers and listeners realize
[02:53:59.417 --> 02:54:01.499]  That info wars is not entertainment.
[02:54:14.531 --> 02:54:16.372]  Forced legalization of pedophilia.
[02:54:16.552 --> 02:54:18.213]  He's a great science fiction writer.
[02:54:18.353 --> 02:54:19.254]  He's so crazy.
[02:54:19.314 --> 02:54:20.014]  He's so cute.
[02:54:20.134 --> 02:54:22.355]  It was one of the voices of The Simpsons.
[02:54:22.655 --> 02:54:30.720]  Harry Shearer, who's a great actor, great writer, did a great job at Spinal Tap, who was in a big British documentary that I was central in called Secret Rulers of the World.
[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:31.920]  We covered Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:37.824]  And he talks about, in the film, about you're listening with your family on vacation out in the woods on a shortwave to Alex Jones.
[02:54:37.904 --> 02:54:39.905]  And he's just such a great fiction writer.
[02:54:40.045 --> 02:54:41.205]  It's so convincing.
[02:54:41.465 --> 02:54:42.366]  You buy into it.
[02:54:42.466 --> 02:54:46.647]  You see, they wouldn't go check out the white papers and documents I was talking about.
[02:54:47.227 --> 02:54:52.088]  Because in 1997, 1998, most things were not on the internet yet.
[02:54:53.589 --> 02:54:54.289]  Now it's all there.
[02:54:54.349 --> 02:55:05.232]  You can go to the Davos Group, the World Economic Forum, and see them announcing implantable chips, the end of the family, the end of the sexes, chemical castration, world government, it's all there.
[02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:11.371]  But back then, I would go to the library and pull this up and people thought I was crazy.
[02:55:11.411 --> 02:55:18.133]  And they thought, why is this guy so concerned and why is he so charismatic for no reason?
[02:55:19.853 --> 02:55:22.934]  Because back then, we were still in the beta test of the New World Order.
[02:55:23.374 --> 02:55:26.675]  Now we're in operational, which means total enslavement and death.
[02:55:28.436 --> 02:55:30.416]  I've been harping on this a lot in the last month.
[02:55:31.136 --> 02:55:33.017]  Joe Biden signed new official U.S.
[02:55:33.057 --> 02:55:33.797]  government policy.
[02:55:34.915 --> 02:55:37.516]  National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[02:55:38.696 --> 02:55:40.797]  And in this document, go read it for yourself online.
[02:55:40.817 --> 02:55:41.357]  Just type it in.
[02:55:41.938 --> 02:55:47.620]  They say if you question lockdowns, if you question forced inoculations, if you question the election, we're going to call you a white supremacist.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:54.162]  And once we say that, that triggers the CIA and the FBI, and we're going to hunt you down and quote, take you out.
[02:55:54.342 --> 02:56:00.044]  I've got FBI spokespersons on MSNBC saying we're going to quote, take out members of Congress that don't agree with the election.
[02:56:00.124 --> 02:56:04.006]  I mean, they're just externalizing the fact that they're going operational.
[02:56:04.246 --> 02:56:04.927]  We're good to go.
[02:56:19.318 --> 02:56:26.120]  But now we're more important than ever because people are finally really starting to listen because they realize I'm not just pulling this out of a hat.
[02:56:26.541 --> 02:56:27.621]  I'm not just making this up.
[02:56:27.701 --> 02:56:30.282]  I'm actually documenting it, and I'm researching it.
[02:56:30.302 --> 02:56:30.982]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:56:31.322 --> 02:56:33.503]  So now our real work really begins.
[02:56:33.663 --> 02:56:35.664]  And if you'll just keep us in the fight, thank you so much.
[02:56:35.784 --> 02:56:36.544]  We're running a special.
[02:56:36.664 --> 02:56:38.885]  Fourth of July already ended, but it runs through this weekend.
