[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.991]  Stop resisting your instincts to say no to this.
[00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:05.692]  Start pushing back.
[00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:11.815]  And again, think about how they're saying, you can't get on a plane, you can't get on a train, you can't have a job, you can't work here if you don't have it.
[00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:17.457]  When it's experimental, it's dangerous, like the Suskigee experiment, and they're just trying to shove it in our face.
[00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:24.441]  And then Joe Biden is our medical doctor, along with Bill Gates, and he's going to tell you, okay, it's okay to go outside now not wearing a mask.
[00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:34.918]  Because most people aren't wearing masks outside now, across the country, and so the peer pressure is now against them, so now he's gonna lift it, so his cult of idiots.
[00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.097]  Won't feel like they lost their tug-of-war.
[00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:40.459]  Because all the left wants is to be in a religion.
[00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.901]  A religion of control of us.
[00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:46.024]  A religion of hen-pecking and controlling language and dominating others.
[00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.006]  Because they have nothing on the inside.
[00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:49.348]  No relationship with God.
[00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:50.368]  No real job.
[00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.369]  No real education.
[00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.291]  Just leftist brainwashing.
[00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:58.016]  They're in a cult like Rose McGowan came out on Fox News and said yesterday.
[00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.277]  It is a damn cult.
[00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:00.418]  I'm part of the freedom cult.
[00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:01.739]  I'm part of the Jesus cult.
[00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.481]  I'm part of the 57 Chevy cult.
[00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:12.428]  I'm part of the give me more freedom, more self-defense, bigger, better, go to space, go to Mars, let's kick some ass cult.
[00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.712]  And you guys are part of the anti-human Harvey Weinstein pedophile cult.
[00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:21.856]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:29.575]  This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed, historic transmission.
[00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.003]  I know how to defeat the globalists.
[00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:37.500]  I've done deep research and I've had major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.801]  I'm going to do my best to lay it all out today.
[00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.182]  The pastor's now been SWAT teamed.
[00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:45.643]  The Polish pastor up in Canada who said no to their illegal actions.
[00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:46.483]  He's now been SWAT teamed.
[00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:48.844]  He'll be joining us coming up next hour.
[00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:49.764]  That happened yesterday.
[00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:55.827]  Steve Quill will be joining us and another great patriot has been put on a no-fly list.
[00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:58.808]  Nick Foyntes just gave us this info minutes ago.
[00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:00.869]  That'll be an exclusive coming up.
[00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.629]  We have
[00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.230]  Biden, our lord and king and master, telling us he's about to lift some of the mask mandate.
[00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.191]  We'll give you the details of that.
[00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:11.412]  But first, a new Gregg Reese report dealing with Big Pharma's enslavement of humanity.
[00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:16.313]  Some dreaded government microchip to track your every move.
[00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:21.015]  But a tissue like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:28.437]  People are finding strange fibers inside their masks and in the COVID-19 test swabs.
[00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:35.877]  Many people are pointing out the similarities between these fibers and Morgellons disease.
[00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:43.641]  A mysterious unexplained skin condition characterized by small fibers emerging from skin sores.
[00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:50.124]  But the fibers we are seeing in the mask and test swabs seem to be different.
[00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.507]  Many have suggested that they are normal constructive fibers.
[00:02:57.307 --> 00:03:01.429]  But upon close examination, they do exhibit strange qualities.
[00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.193]  In this video, when affected by wind, the fiber behaves exactly how one would expect.
[00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:12.035]  But when breathed upon, it reacts differently.
[00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:14.377]  It appears to come to life.
[00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:20.603]  The fibers look and behave similar to how Theragrippers are described.
[00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:27.310]  Inspired by parasitic worms, Theragrippers were created at Johns Hopkins University.
[00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:35.299]  Theragrippers are as small as a speck of dust and designed to deliver time-release medication into the host body.
[00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:45.482]  They operate like small compressed springs with a temperature-triggered coating that releases the stored energy autonomously at body temperature.
[00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:49.584]  Compressed springs with temperature-triggered coating.
[00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.214]  The mask fiber's reaction to human breath could easily be described as spring-like.
[00:03:57.035 --> 00:04:12.485]  And while one is wearing the mask, the fibers would be springing in towards their mouths as they breathe, as if the masks were a delivery system for hidden theragrippers loaded with drugs ready to be released into the host's bloodstream.
[00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:19.870]  The same spring-like fibers can be found in both the masks and the COVID-19 test swabs.
[00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.731]  Under magnification, the test swab appears to have glass-like fibers.
[00:04:27.092 --> 00:04:35.693]  In one experiment, the PCR test swab was rubbed against a piece of raw meat to roughly emulate the living tissue inside our nasal cavity.
[00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:41.075]  And several of the glass-like fibers deeply penetrated themselves into the flesh.
[00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:46.036]  Is this happening inside of our nasal cavity when we are being tested?
[00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.219]  Perhaps this is normal.
[00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.241]  There was a time in the not-so-distant past when this would all sound crazy.
[00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.541]  But those days are over.
[00:04:57.442 --> 00:05:04.565]  Millions of people are proudly volunteering to have their DNA permanently experimented on by Big Pharma.
[00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:07.347]  We are living in a new era.
[00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:14.055]  DARPA has been developing BCIs, Brain Computer Interfaces, since the 1960s.
[00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:20.483]  And now they are ready to inject our military with a technology that will continuously test their blood.
[00:05:20.723 --> 00:05:29.928]  It's not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.
[00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:36.031]  The overwhelming desire of the powers that be seems to be putting something inside of us.
[00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:39.813]  Putting an experimental vaccine inside of us.
[00:05:40.853 --> 00:05:44.215]  Putting the remnants of an aborted child inside of us.
[00:05:46.124 --> 00:05:48.066]  How is that any different than a rape?
[00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:53.750]  And how is it that anyone is actually okay with any of this?
[00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:57.673]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:14.099]  It's Tuesday, April 27th.
[00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.620]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:17.682]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:20.925]  Very blessed and honored that you've chosen to join us today.
[00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:23.347]  So here we are.
[00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:30.314]  I'm going to be very calm here because this is so important and so huge and so illegal and so
[00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:36.625]  Over the top, that if we just put this information out there, it'll become normalized.
[00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:38.806]  We must soak this in.
[00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.187]  We must cogitate on it.
[00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:43.490]  We must mold around psychologically, spiritually.
[00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.431]  We should pray about this.
[00:06:47.153 --> 00:06:50.335]  Because this is all now revealing itself.
[00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:51.396]  It's coming out in the open.
[00:06:51.936 --> 00:06:53.878]  Just in one stack.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.701]  One stack of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:03.906]  One inch tall stack of 24 stacks, this is just today's news, is so mind-blowing, so key, so important that I shudder at even trying to properly
[00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:25.780]  Documented.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:35.550]  So I will just direct you in this segment to what the big stories are in my view and then I will humbly try to cover it as best I can.
[00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.192]  And then we got big guests coming up as well.
[00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:47.703]  With SWAT teams attacking churches in Canada now and just yesterday and Nick Fuentes put on a no-fly list joining us and
[00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:51.746]  Steve Quayle coming on and just all hell breaking lists.
[00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:55.149]  It's going to get crazier from here on out, but at least it's going to be out in the open.
[00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.254]  But let me give you the big news, and all of these are huge, and all of these connect together.
[00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.697]  Obviously, Biden doesn't have the power to mandate masks.
[00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:08.460]  He doesn't have the power to say, now you can go outside without a mask.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.201]  Now you can go to 4th of July.
[00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:11.062]  I'm your God.
[00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:11.602]  I'm your king.
[00:08:11.642 --> 00:08:12.183]  I'm your savior.
[00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:15.939]  That is a gigantor story.
[00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.280]  And Tucker Carlson coming out and saying, don't just not wear a mask in public.
[00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:30.023]  Educate people that it doesn't protect them and that it actually hurts children's health psychologically and physically in major studies.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:42.869]  Well, next year's news today, I've been out since April of last year, every week, in an armored vehicle, because the left in Austin attacks us with bottles, hatchets, and hammers, and other devices.
[00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.650]  It's all on video.
[00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.453]  Cue that up later, us, the guy attacking the armored vehicle with a hammer, please.
[00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:54.899]  It's happened about five times now, but we go out and tell them, hey, the masks are never coming off until you say no.
[00:08:55.219 --> 00:09:00.964]  That gives you bacterial pneumonia, it psychologically screws up children, and it doesn't protect you.
[00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:12.269]  And Carlson is now saying that you need to go out, and just like you see somebody beating their kid at Walmart, you need to say, hey, you need to stop that.
[00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:17.952]  Quite frankly, you're their parent, the kid's out of control, maybe they need a good spat.
[00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:19.353]  Maybe he's being too liberal there.
[00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.394]  The point is, this is child abuse.
[00:09:23.755 --> 00:09:25.656]  More like you see somebody breaking the skin at Walmart.
[00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:30.808]  I'm all about reward and punishment with kids.
[00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:31.528]  Carrot the stick.
[00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:33.449]  Spanking isn't needed a lot, but sometimes it is needed.
[00:09:33.469 --> 00:09:37.872]  But his point is to the left, is that you're abusing children here.
[00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:39.052]  That's coming up.
[00:09:39.092 --> 00:09:41.293]  Now, that's not the number one COVID story.
[00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:42.094]  It's very important.
[00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:48.257]  It ties into Biden, that whole discussion of pushing back, of getting on the offense.
[00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:55.134]  Because they're bullies and say you can't get on an airplane or have a job until you take an experimental vaccine that doesn't even protect you.
[00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:56.615]  It's been banned in a bunch of countries.
[00:09:56.675 --> 00:09:57.736]  It's preposterous.
[00:09:58.276 --> 00:10:01.978]  That's an important one story out of this.
[00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:05.980]  We've got three articles on it.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.342]  What Biden said to announce today, the statistics on the mask, and then what Tucker said.
[00:10:10.702 --> 00:10:11.902]  That's my research here.
[00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:14.584]  This isn't props I put out here on the desk to impress you.
[00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:16.384]  I went over all this today and last night.
[00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:17.625]  All of it.
[00:10:19.904 --> 00:10:24.206]  So, that's one little three-page thing out of this.
[00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:28.048]  Just imagine my frustration every day trying to get to all this.
[00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:28.748]  It's impossible.
[00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.050]  Here's the big super supreme enchilada.
[00:10:36.474 --> 00:10:43.756]  Medical doctors all over the world, from Germany to Canada, that say this, are being arrested by the police.
[00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:44.996]  That's coming up.
[00:10:45.717 --> 00:10:54.199]  German police ransack the house of doctor after he provides evidence in court that children are endangered in their mental, physical, and spiritual well-being by the obligation to wear face masks.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.361]  I know this, they're going to hate leftist control freaks for the rest of their life.
[00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:03.922]  Now, you think that's big?
[00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:09.328]  That is the least important stack of the COVID news, and it's incredibly important.
[00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.070]  Get ready for this.
[00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:19.173]  I was sitting there this morning with my iPad, checking out enemy publications.
[00:11:19.193 --> 00:11:26.898]  I went to the New York Times and started choking on my bite of egg, literally coughing it up because it's just so outrageous.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.623]  Not only have they shut India down and they admit starved 2 million people to death extra,
[00:11:35.697 --> 00:11:38.478]  With the lockdown that's now back in place and will kill millions more.
[00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.699]  And so that's why there's more funeral pyres there.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.203]  They not only banned the Pfizer shot three months ago, because in illegal testing it turned out Pfizer was doing a bunch of people got sick and died.
[00:11:50.963 --> 00:11:51.843]  Hold on to your hat.
[00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:59.807]  The AstraZeneca vaccine now banned in more than 30 countries, 21 in Europe, the Philippines, a bunch of others.
[00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:02.928]  Had the crew print me a big list of those today.
[00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:06.298]  So many countries, I can't even keep track.
[00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.119]  Every time I think there's 30-something, it's probably 50-something.
[00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:14.360]  I mean, there's just new ones all the time because of deaths and blood clots and strokes and heart attacks.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.921]  The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most banned vaccine in the world.
[00:12:19.461 --> 00:12:24.061]  And when you say, hey, I don't want it, they go, you're insane, it's totally safe, even though it's banned everywhere.
[00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:25.202]  Gaslighting.
[00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:28.402]  It gets more out of control.
[00:12:31.063 --> 00:12:31.983]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:36.454]  Joe Biden announced yesterday he's going to send aid to India.
[00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:41.616]  It's not vitamin C. It's not vitamin D. It's not an end to the lockdown.
[00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:42.857]  It's not zinc.
[00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:45.178]  It's not even oxygen bottles.
[00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:57.923]  When any medical doctor, the Indians aren't stupid, they're poor, because the population is so huge, that you can do inhaled steroid and 100% of the time helps you, knocks it out.
[00:12:58.404 --> 00:12:59.524]  They're not telling them any of that.
[00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:01.145]  They're shipping them.
[00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:08.772]  Tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca that's even banned in the U.S.
[00:13:08.832 --> 00:13:10.174]  is not authorized in the U.S.
[00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:14.678]  Biden's gonna dump Europe's banned vaccine on the Indians!
[00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:16.760]  Total war crime!
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.604]  I mean, there's no end!
[00:13:20.804 --> 00:13:21.845]  Wait, it gets worse!
[00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:25.129]  That's only the fourth article!
[00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:30.808]  Now you're starting to get where I'm coming from.
[00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:46.540]  I could talk the whole show, and maybe we should, about just dumping a banned vaccine in 21 countries in Europe, and all total 30-something around the world, because it kills so many people, makes your blood basically dissolve, makes all your platelets disappear.
[00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:52.585]  And they call it a blood clot.
[00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:53.305]  It's not a blood clot.
[00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:55.067]  Your blood just falls apart.
[00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:57.733]  Oh, but U.S.
[00:13:57.813 --> 00:14:03.836]  is sending vaccine materials to ravaged, COVID ravaged India, Bloomberg.
[00:14:04.096 --> 00:14:05.477]  It should be U.S.
[00:14:05.597 --> 00:14:08.158]  dumps unapproved vaccine in the U.S.
[00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:11.380]  banned across the world, dangerous drug.
[00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:20.676]  Just like what Bayer did when they got caught in Europe putting HIV and Hepatitis in the Factor VIII with Bill Clinton out of Arkansas.
[00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:24.118]  They would certify all the blood out of Arkansas as tested and safe.
[00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:27.020]  They would not certify it knowing it had HIV and Hepatitis.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.464]  They would mix it together in giant vats, purify out the blood clotting factor.
[00:14:33.224 --> 00:14:34.185]  They called it Factor VIII.
[00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:41.090]  And then Bayer, good old Heil Hitler Bayer, their own executives in Australia and
[00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:47.264]  Canada and France are on the record saying, there are too many hemophiliacs.
[00:14:49.526 --> 00:14:50.888]  Dump it on the third world.
[00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.971]  That all came out at the time.
[00:14:56.633 --> 00:15:02.559]  And they even had meetings about, there's too many hemophiliacs, dump it on them.
[00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:03.520]  That's a quote.
[00:15:09.194 --> 00:15:10.014]  Ah, yes.
[00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:13.117]  And now the banned vaccine.
[00:15:13.137 --> 00:15:15.298]  Oh, we're going to give it to the Indians.
[00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.680]  And Bloomberg's loving and liberal.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.101]  Oh.
[00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:21.463]  And now he's going to commit a holocaust against the Indians.
[00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.485]  But it's OK, because he's liberal.
[00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.788]  That's just, oh, that's just two of the COVID stories.
[00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:29.649]  I'll tell you about the other ones when we come back.
[00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:35.792]  There's so much, but then there's pushback, and that's really overall probably the most important, isn't it?
[00:15:36.272 --> 00:15:39.213]  Because if we don't start standing up, we're all dead and doornails.
[00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:41.274]  It's Indians today, it's all of us tomorrow.
[00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:46.757]  Do you work for Big Tech?
[00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:47.977]  Are you part of the Trannies?
[00:15:48.357 --> 00:15:48.958]  I'm the establishment.
[00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:50.138]  So, no, you are.
[00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:50.918]  So tell us, where do you work?
[00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:51.799]  What do you do?
[00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:52.599]  I work for Google.
[00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.880]  I'm just, hey, don't do that.
[00:15:54.858 --> 00:15:55.378]  Don't touch me.
[00:15:55.518 --> 00:15:56.999]  Stop purchasing the link.
[00:15:57.539 --> 00:15:58.319]  Take the mask off.
[00:15:58.379 --> 00:15:59.499]  Look at this guy.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.281]  India banned the Pfizer vaccine because it was killing people.
[00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:11.903]  And you flip us off because you're the... Biden just called for death camps in China for Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims, and you love it.
[00:16:12.443 --> 00:16:16.345]  There's nothing that you leftists won't do, even though it's going to kill you.
[00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:17.445]  Women.
[00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:21.605]  Who are leftists flip us off because they love Bill Gates.
[00:16:21.746 --> 00:16:22.807]  They love Xi Jinping.
[00:16:23.347 --> 00:16:27.991]  They love Joe Biden saying China can run death camps and it's a good thing.
[00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:30.193]  You are under globalist attack.
[00:16:30.753 --> 00:16:33.876]  You are under globalist depopulation.
[00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:41.703]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go!
[00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:52.975]  In defiance of the anti-free speech, we're here to support freedom!
[00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:55.817]  Not Alex Jones!
[00:16:55.897 --> 00:17:00.260]  We're here to support freedom!
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.842]  We're here to support freedom!
[00:17:02.882 --> 00:17:05.844]  We're here to support freedom!
[00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:22.389]  We're exercising our free space, and I want to salute all the amazing fellow Texans that came out here against the globalists, and understand that it's a Chinese-Globalist-Bill Gates attack on our freedom.
[00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:30.813]  The Chi-Coms have publicly been caught launching the attack, and they've got their operatives out here now, just speaking all the truth.
[00:17:30.993 --> 00:17:37.036]  The American knows this was the attempt to shut us down and shut down the free assembly.
[00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.861]  I salute you all!
[00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:54.550]  Texas is leading the way against this tyranny.
[00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.314]  They have tried to install their martial law.
[00:17:59.474 --> 00:17:59.915]  Texas!
[00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:00.315]  Texas!
[00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:00.915]  Texas!
[00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:01.336]  Texas!
[00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:01.916]  Texas!
[00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:02.317]  Texas!
[00:18:02.537 --> 00:18:02.937]  Texas!
[00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:03.217]  Texas!
[00:18:03.237 --> 00:18:03.418]  Texas!
[00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:03.898]  Texas!
[00:18:03.938 --> 00:18:04.318]  Texas!
[00:18:04.498 --> 00:18:04.839]  Texas!
[00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:05.179]  Texas!
[00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:09.667]  USA!
[00:18:09.687 --> 00:18:10.088]  USA!
[00:18:10.468 --> 00:18:11.429]  USA!
[00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:23.038]  We know the communist Chinese launched this attack with the deep state and America is here exercising its freedom of speech.
[00:18:23.699 --> 00:18:29.483]  All Americans and all American businesses are essential.
[00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:35.588]  Don't let them tell you like the Nazis did that you are not essential.
[00:18:36.442 --> 00:18:45.304]  Whether you are old, whether you are young, whether you are black, whether you are white, you are essential.
[00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:47.265]  America is essential.
[00:18:47.925 --> 00:18:58.368]  And this is 21st century war attempting to shut us down, and Texas is leading the way against these tyrants, and I am honored to be with you.
[00:19:05.522 --> 00:19:06.543]  Texas!
[00:19:06.663 --> 00:19:07.724]  Texas!
[00:19:08.104 --> 00:19:09.084]  Texas!
[00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:09.985]  Texas!
[00:19:27.716 --> 00:19:30.857]  Alex, we love you!
[00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:38.440]  So Father God, we thank you for Alex Jones, and we thank you for Texas, we thank you for America.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:50.303]  I want to salute you all, and I want you to know that Shy Con and Bill Gates have been caught carrying this out, and the world is rejecting this!
[00:19:56.544 --> 00:20:01.128]  God bless you all for the standing and defiance of this charity!
[00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:02.329]  Choose freedom!
[00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.590]  Choose America!
[00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.951]  Not fear!
[00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.493]  Not propaganda!
[00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:10.475]  And their whole eye is falling in!
[00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:11.175]  It's all PSYOP!
[00:20:11.216 --> 00:20:12.256]  God bless you!
[00:20:12.296 --> 00:20:16.480]  Other speakers get up here!
[00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:27.027]  Well, Tucker Carlson, as usual, knocked it out of the park last night.
[00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:50.761]  And he said, look, you have MIT, you have all these big studies that mask, don't protect you, don't help you.
[00:20:51.781 --> 00:20:55.064]  Having people stand six feet apart is just made up.
[00:20:56.724 --> 00:21:08.069]  It's all crap, but it makes you feel good and it makes the little busybodies who want to enforce it get into the game of spying on their neighbors, tattling as people are having a secret church service.
[00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:16.894]  It gets them into the mode and then vertically integrates the economy for the big banks and big tech, who've all become even more powerful in the process.
[00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:19.075]  It's about global domination.
[00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:45.772]  Like it always is with these tyrants, and now medical doctors in Canada, in Germany, in England, I've seen it in the news, more today, are being ransacked, are being arrested for doing video streams online, giving out medical information and telling people that most of the COVID deaths were other things, which even the New York Times admits, but they're the New York Times.
[00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:57.508]  I saw an MSNBC article, I saw an NBC story last week saying, oh, all these people that got arrested that weren't violent at the Capitol, who said they were journalists, they don't work for mainstream news, so they're not protected.
[00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:10.792]  Yes, the CNN reporters, yes, the Wall Street Journal reporters, yes, Nancy Pelosi's nephew, yes, yes, yes, yes, the National Geographic, they were allowed in, but everybody else, you're not journalists.
[00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:13.861]  Here's an InfoWars.com article.
[00:22:13.921 --> 00:22:18.487]  Facebook bans Australian Member of Parliament for anti-lockdown post.
[00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.635]  Members of Parliament aren't allowed to have their free speech now.
[00:22:25.815 --> 00:22:26.136]  You see?
[00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:31.394]  Because they're saying we should be not locked down.
[00:22:31.414 --> 00:22:34.976]  You know, they're saying if they have one case in Australia, they're going to lock down one case in New Zealand.
[00:22:35.457 --> 00:22:37.778]  And the testing is almost 100% fake.
[00:22:38.038 --> 00:22:39.559]  It's all based on fraud.
[00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:42.080]  Is there real cold viruses cooked up in labs?
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.581]  Does Bill Gates own them with Fauci?
[00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:44.562]  Absolutely.
[00:22:45.002 --> 00:22:46.503]  Do they have more deadly versions coming out?
[00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:52.226]  Do all the studies show that taking the vaccine makes you a shedder that breeds real deadly viruses in your body?
[00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:55.428]  That's now, it looks like sterilizing women.
[00:22:57.705 --> 00:23:02.026]  Who haven't even ever had the vaccine but are next to people?
[00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:03.827]  That's in the mainline literature!
[00:23:05.207 --> 00:23:16.691]  That's why schools around the world are banning people working there who've taken the experimental mRNA gene therapy because it can cause the spread of real viruses.
[00:23:18.112 --> 00:23:21.893]  That's even your precious Wall Street Journal and NPR reporting that.
[00:23:23.103 --> 00:23:27.346]  So it's a big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:28.346 --> 00:23:36.131]  But let's go ahead and go to this piece from Tucker Carlson last night saying this is child abuse, and when you see people doing it to children, say something to them.
[00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:37.071]  I do it.
[00:23:37.692 --> 00:23:39.713]  I lovingly say, hey, you know, they give them bacterial pneumonia.
[00:23:39.993 --> 00:23:41.774]  You know, children can't even get sick from COVID, really.
[00:23:44.196 --> 00:23:47.058]  But again, they feel like the social pressure, they want a virtue signal.
[00:23:47.278 --> 00:23:51.340]  Hell, I got photos here in my stack of people putting masks on their dogs.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.561]  It's real, folks.
[00:23:56.465 --> 00:23:58.087]  So here is Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:23:59.428 --> 00:24:02.231]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:05.014]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[00:24:05.775 --> 00:24:07.016]  Masks are for the guilty.
[00:24:07.336 --> 00:24:09.358]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:13.442]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:15.985]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:17.507]  The rest of us showed our face.
[00:24:17.547 --> 00:24:18.427]  We were free people.
[00:24:19.468 --> 00:24:27.813]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:32.996]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[00:24:33.617 --> 00:24:38.680]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.661]  We wear them because we have to.
[00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:45.184]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[00:24:45.704 --> 00:24:46.505]  How neurotic are they?
[00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:47.685]  Well, we know.
[00:24:48.346 --> 00:24:58.515]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[00:24:59.275 --> 00:25:02.118]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:07.322]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask,
[00:25:08.283 --> 00:25:10.684]  Angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[00:25:10.744 --> 00:25:11.545]  How could you?
[00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:13.065]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:14.466]  How could you?
[00:25:14.926 --> 00:25:17.708]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[00:25:18.308 --> 00:25:20.329]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[00:25:20.449 --> 00:25:21.390]  They're the aggressors.
[00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.392]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:30.194]  So the next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[00:25:30.774 --> 00:25:32.055]  Ask politely but firmly.
[00:25:32.275 --> 00:25:33.775]  Would you please take off your mask?
[00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:36.777]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[00:25:37.097 --> 00:25:39.358]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[00:25:40.578 --> 00:25:47.701]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble in an elevator.
[00:25:48.362 --> 00:25:49.302]  It's repulsive.
[00:25:49.402 --> 00:25:50.703]  Don't do it around other people.
[00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:53.004]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[00:25:54.204 --> 00:25:57.045]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[00:25:57.726 --> 00:26:04.388]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid at Walmart.
[00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:06.129]  Call the police immediately.
[00:26:06.449 --> 00:26:08.030]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.851]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:12.272]  What you're looking at is abuse.
[00:26:12.332 --> 00:26:15.933]  It's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[00:26:16.634 --> 00:26:20.355]  If it's your own children being abused, then act on it.
[00:26:20.415 --> 00:26:20.896]  Say no.
[00:26:21.096 --> 00:26:21.776]  Stop resisting.
[00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:23.958]  Your common sense.
[00:26:24.139 --> 00:26:25.121]  Resist the tyranny.
[00:26:26.343 --> 00:26:28.006]  Resist what you know is killing you.
[00:26:28.707 --> 00:26:29.708]  Resist the bullying.
[00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.833]  Stop resisting your instincts to say no to this.
[00:26:35.273 --> 00:26:36.514]  Start pushing back.
[00:27:01.851 --> 00:27:05.755]  He's now against them, so now he's gonna lift it, so his cult of idiots...
[00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:08.931]  Won't feel like they lost their tug-of-war.
[00:27:08.951 --> 00:27:11.312]  Because all the left wants is to be in a religion.
[00:27:11.533 --> 00:27:12.754]  A religion of control of us.
[00:27:13.014 --> 00:27:16.877]  A religion of hen-pecking and controlling language and dominating others.
[00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:18.858]  Because they have nothing on the inside.
[00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:20.199]  No relationship with God.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.220]  No real job.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.221]  No real education.
[00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:24.142]  Just leftist brainwashing.
[00:27:24.182 --> 00:27:28.866]  They're in a cult like Rose McGowan came out on Fox News and said yesterday.
[00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:30.127]  It is a damn cult.
[00:27:30.347 --> 00:27:31.268]  I'm part of the freedom cult.
[00:27:31.528 --> 00:27:32.589]  I'm part of the Jesus cult.
[00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:35.331]  I'm part of the 57 Chevy cult.
[00:27:35.591 --> 00:27:43.276]  I'm part of the give me more freedom, more self-defense, bigger, better, go to space, go to Mars, let's kick some ass cult.
[00:27:43.556 --> 00:27:47.578]  And you guys are part of the anti-human Harvey Weinstein pedophile cult.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.801]  And it's starting to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:57.305]  Miami School says they won't employ people who get COVID-19 vaccination, citing vaccine
[00:27:59.008 --> 00:28:05.351]  Misinformation, says CBS News, and the school goes on to say, it's an experimental COVID-19 injection.
[00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:09.873]  It's a gene therapy, and we're worried it can make other people sick through viral shedding.
[00:28:10.153 --> 00:28:13.514]  Hell, that's even in your precious Wall Street Journal and NPR!
[00:28:13.754 --> 00:28:15.415]  That's what the top scientists say!
[00:28:15.635 --> 00:28:17.196]  Because it's not a regular virus.
[00:28:17.816 --> 00:28:21.978]  It goes in and completely makes your cell start programming a protein.
[00:28:23.237 --> 00:28:32.365]  Which is associated with fertility, and associated with the brain, and that's why there's more studies about Alzheimer's and infertility, and lo and behold, women that are getting the vaccine are having miscarriages!
[00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:36.449]  And lo and behold, a lot of women that are getting the vaccine have all these tumors in their uteruses now!
[00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:38.010]  That's in mainstream news!
[00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.953]  You can even find CBS news that, well, don't worry about those tumors, those aren't bad.
[00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:46.918]  Yes, the vaccine gives you some tumors, yes, it makes your lymph nodes swell up, but everything's okay.
[00:28:47.398 --> 00:28:47.999]  Everything's fine.
[00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:48.980]  Yeah, right.
[00:28:49.998 --> 00:28:50.818]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:54.280]  All right, we've got Nick Fuentes just put on a no-fly list.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.141]  The article just exclusively went up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:03.063]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Nick Fuentes is giving us the exclusive
[00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:08.753]  He has been banned off of the internet as we know it, except for his own site, which is still very popular.
[00:29:08.793 --> 00:29:09.613]  It makes them mad.
[00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:20.817]  That's why it's important to get all of his material and share it via distribution, via proxy, that James O'Keefe was in studio with us last week, talking about AmericaFirst.live.
[00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:24.005]  is his website AmericaFirst.live.
[00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:34.460]  I'm Alex Jones with Band.Video and InfoWars.com and we're on a couple hundred radio stations, a hundred or so cable and TV stations, but it's just absolutely important
[00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:44.549]  For all of us, ladies and gentlemen, to understand that the resistance only gets magnified and only gets expanded so the truth gets out when you speak out and you take action.
[00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.593]  Here's the article from InfoWars.com.
[00:29:47.693 --> 00:29:48.174]  Breaking!
[00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:53.941]  America's first founder, Nick Fuentes, put on no-fly list.
[00:29:56.069 --> 00:29:56.929]  And they told him why.
[00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:59.810]  He were at the Capitol, not even in the Capitol.
[00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.850]  See, now they've arrested 500 that went in.
[00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.411]  Now they want to attack those that are without.
[00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:06.392]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:10.113]  But let's tie that together with just these stories breaking today.
[00:30:11.213 --> 00:30:15.774]  Facebook bans Australian Member of Parliament for anti-lockdown post.
[00:30:15.934 --> 00:30:17.154]  Only the UN has speech.
[00:30:17.595 --> 00:30:20.875]  You're not allowed to speak out, Member of Parliament.
[00:30:22.136 --> 00:30:23.116]  Greg Kelly.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.480]  Wow!
[00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:29.063]  How a foreign entity can see Facebook as three billion members.
[00:30:29.103 --> 00:30:30.084]  It's the biggest country in the world.
[00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:31.505]  It decides, you see.
[00:30:32.606 --> 00:30:40.552]  Canadian government accused of assault on free speech of a proposed policy and law to police videos posted on social media.
[00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:42.713]  Here's another one today.
[00:30:43.094 --> 00:30:48.758]  German police ransacked the home of doctor as he provides evidence in court that children are endangered.
[00:30:49.895 --> 00:30:57.456]  And their mental and physical and spiritual well-being, being obliged to wear the face mask, just what Tucker Carlson was talking about, how we need to push back.
[00:30:57.837 --> 00:30:59.397]  So that's just today.
[00:30:59.437 --> 00:31:10.059]  I've got more of this, where they're intimidating, going to witnesses in the Chauvin trial and throwing pig blood on what they think's their house at pig heads, and going to the jurors' houses, we now learn.
[00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:14.980]  Somebody had leaked it, that's why they voted, and went along with the mob intimidating them.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.822]  Whether you think Chauvin was guilty or not, he's got to go free.
[00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.664]  I don't care if he's black or white because of that.
[00:31:20.105 --> 00:31:31.556]  But anybody who's America first, anybody that stands for what our republic stood for, ideas superior to any out there, mimicked across the world before the Chinese communists became the model, is being shut down in silence.
[00:31:31.596 --> 00:31:31.876]  And so...
[00:31:32.737 --> 00:31:40.165]  Just as it was Alex Jones first he platformed on a massive way three years ago and now it's everybody else including the former president and members of Congress.
[00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:47.573]  We'll all be Nick Fuentes soon and Laura Loomer because they're going after the Uber Eats, the Uber cars, the
[00:31:48.334 --> 00:31:51.717]  The hotel reservations, the Airbnb.
[00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:57.302]  This is the true de-platforming of humans themselves, the electronic gulag.
[00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:00.364]  Joining us with the exclusive is Nick Fuentes.
[00:32:00.424 --> 00:32:01.505]  Nick, great to have you on.
[00:32:02.146 --> 00:32:03.427]  We are all Nick Fuentes now.
[00:32:03.487 --> 00:32:04.808]  Tell us what the hell's going on here.
[00:32:05.848 --> 00:32:07.851]  Yeah, well thank you so much for having me on.
[00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:12.997]  So, actually my plans today were very different from what's transpired so far.
[00:32:13.678 --> 00:32:17.222]  It was me, Michelle Malkin, Laura Loomer, Vince James, and Lauren Witzke.
[00:32:17.242 --> 00:32:22.189]  We were all planning on going down to Florida to hold a press conference about Ron DeSantis.
[00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:36.140]  Big tech censorship legislation, which you may know that Ron DeSantis sponsored a bill in the Florida State House that would go after the big tech companies and try to prevent them from censoring candidates for office, statewide candidates.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.661]  He's also saying no government vaccine passports.
[00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:39.202]  He's a great guy.
[00:32:40.134 --> 00:32:41.034]  That's right, yeah.
[00:32:41.054 --> 00:32:42.635]  And we love Governor Ron DeSantis.
[00:32:42.695 --> 00:32:56.080]  And so I was planning on flying down to Florida, Palm Beach in particular, to do a small press conference and encourage the Florida State House to pass the bill, as well as to include some amendments that we had suggested, which include increasing the penalty.
[00:32:57.037 --> 00:33:09.901]  Or social media companies that censor, as well as broadening the definition of who exactly the law would apply to, not just candidates, but also we want it to apply to current office holders as well as all the citizens of Florida.
[00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:15.844]  So my plan was to fly down and do a little press conference today, which is actually still going to go forward at 3.30.
[00:33:17.644 --> 00:33:18.245]  Eastern time.
[00:33:18.585 --> 00:33:33.135]  And so I showed up to the airport and I actually got there a couple of hours early because I was told by some friends of mine, Lauren Witzke and Vince James in particular, that they had been subject to advanced screening at the airport because of their involvement and January 6th.
[00:33:33.535 --> 00:33:38.438]  And I know that both of them were not inside the Capitol building, but they were in the district the day that that happened.
[00:33:38.478 --> 00:33:40.120]  And that's the same story with me.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.621]  I was not inside the building.
[00:33:42.361 --> 00:33:47.365]  But I was outside and I was at the Trump rally on the Ellipse, which took place earlier.
[00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:49.106]  And I think I actually saw you there as well.
[00:33:49.746 --> 00:33:54.630]  And so I got to the airport a couple of hours early and I prepared for advanced screening.
[00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:58.433]  You know, I got there early enough that if they had to swab everything in my
[00:33:59.173 --> 00:33:59.713]  We're good to go.
[00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:23.040]  She says, I'm not getting clearance, I can't check you in.
[00:34:23.401 --> 00:34:27.123]  She calls the corporate security for American Airlines and they clear me.
[00:34:27.643 --> 00:34:34.928]  And then she goes through to TSA, to the airport security, and they relay to her and she relays to me that I'm unable to fly.
[00:34:35.048 --> 00:34:36.990]  And she said they would say nothing other than that.
[00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.671]  And you know, it's interesting because the
[00:34:39.554 --> 00:34:40.595]  Lady at American.
[00:34:40.655 --> 00:34:42.316]  My first flight was American Airlines.
[00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:47.541]  She was actually somewhat sympathetic because she said, you know, is there anything that might be causing this?
[00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:49.062]  Is it a mask thing?
[00:34:49.102 --> 00:34:51.124]  Did you have an incident on American before?
[00:34:51.144 --> 00:34:53.005]  I said, no, nothing like that.
[00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:55.468]  Never any issues like that on American Airlines.
[00:34:55.548 --> 00:34:57.689]  And, you know, I've been flying pretty recently.
[00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.692]  She said, OK, well, I'll give them another call and they relay the same message.
[00:35:02.732 --> 00:35:03.912]  I'm not able to fly.
[00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:05.833]  And I said, well, you know, honestly, it's political.
[00:35:05.873 --> 00:35:07.013]  I said, I'm a political guy.
[00:35:07.033 --> 00:35:08.394]  I said, I think it's political.
[00:35:08.434 --> 00:35:14.316]  And she goes, she goes, I'm not supposed to say this, but I think this woke stuff is out of control and I could get fired.
[00:35:14.376 --> 00:35:16.417]  But they're pushing this on the corporations.
[00:35:16.797 --> 00:35:19.598]  So, you know, she was even sympathetic and she called a few times and.
[00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:23.862]  The message came down, all they could say was, I do not have clearance to fly.
[00:35:23.882 --> 00:35:31.509]  So I went over and I booked another flight immediately after at United, because I figured, you know, maybe it's an American Airlines thing, maybe that's their corporate policy.
[00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:42.258]  That's right, because in the days after the Capitol event, the woke airlines themselves would just look at who you were, and if you were wearing a Make America Great Again hat, they would ban you as well, but that was selective.
[00:35:42.538 --> 00:35:44.740]  You were checking another, hoping this was just selective.
[00:35:45.842 --> 00:35:46.482]  Exactly right.
[00:35:46.522 --> 00:35:50.765]  And there were some very activist corporations like Bank of America and the airlines.
[00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:55.648]  They were willing and they were actively going in and doing what they thought is the government's job.
[00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:56.729]  And so you're right.
[00:35:56.769 --> 00:35:57.830]  I thought it was American.
[00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.311]  So I went over to United.
[00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:00.932]  I went all the way over to the other terminal.
[00:36:01.012 --> 00:36:03.573]  I booked the same flight, you know, 1040 a.m.
[00:36:03.933 --> 00:36:05.214]  to Palm Beach from O'Hare.
[00:36:05.554 --> 00:36:08.216]  I went up to the counter and she told me the exact same thing.
[00:36:08.256 --> 00:36:10.858]  She was on the phone with the TSA for a half hour, said nope.
[00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:13.419]  I'm sorry, and she goes, and you know what?
[00:36:13.479 --> 00:36:15.981]  I just googled you, and I think I know why that is.
[00:36:16.061 --> 00:36:16.761]  That's what she said.
[00:36:16.781 --> 00:36:20.083]  She goes, and I'm so sorry, but there's nothing I could do.
[00:36:20.363 --> 00:36:22.064]  I said, okay, is there anyone I could talk to?
[00:36:22.124 --> 00:36:23.245]  Can I go to the TSA?
[00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:23.845]  She goes, nope.
[00:36:24.528 --> 00:36:25.930]  Nobody could talk to, that's it.
[00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:31.356]  So, I'm on the no-fly list, and it has to do with the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:36:31.436 --> 00:36:35.480]  And, you know, like you, I was not inside the building, and therefore I didn't commit a crime.
[00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:39.945]  They're charging all these people, 500-plus people, and they want to throw the book at them.
[00:36:40.226 --> 00:36:41.247]  What are they charging them for?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.881]  Trespassing, disorderly conduct, these are misdemeanor charges, and I didn't even do that!
[00:36:47.421 --> 00:37:03.185]  I went to the Trump rally on the Ellipse, which is a totally legal, permissible, political rally from the sitting President of the United States, and then I, like thousands of other people, went down to the Capitol grounds, and was out there protesting outside the Capitol, which is our right to do so.
[00:37:03.225 --> 00:37:11.287]  Absolutely, now maybe you were burning something down or shooting cops, and were liberal in Black Lives Matter, you'd be, you know, allowed to fly, but look, I bet next time I fly, they're gonna try to block me.
[00:37:11.787 --> 00:37:13.008]  This is the lawlessness.
[00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:13.928]  This is the deep state.
[00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:15.930]  Congress has allowed censorship online.
[00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.152]  Now they're going to allow us to be put in gulags, and I guess finally killed.
[00:37:19.492 --> 00:37:22.754]  I was talking to a top national talk show today, and he believes that's where this is going.
[00:37:22.994 --> 00:37:25.116]  He believes it's going to them killing us.
[00:37:25.156 --> 00:37:25.996]  It's a household name.
[00:37:26.697 --> 00:37:27.777]  Stay there, Nick Fuentes.
[00:37:27.817 --> 00:37:28.798]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:28.838 --> 00:37:32.240]  Folks, they are literally, absolutely setting up authoritarianism.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.882]  Nick Fuentes banned from travel on planes.
[00:37:35.942 --> 00:37:38.124]  Next, you know they're going to probably come arrest him, and me too.
[00:37:38.904 --> 00:37:40.344]  So the left will celebrate this.
[00:37:40.364 --> 00:37:41.485]  They love the fascism.
[00:37:41.685 --> 00:37:42.645]  They love the tyranny.
[00:37:42.805 --> 00:37:43.385]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:44.806 --> 00:37:46.946]  It's time to stop being domesticated.
[00:37:47.506 --> 00:37:49.147]  It's time to stop submitting.
[00:37:49.647 --> 00:37:52.648]  It's time to say no to the anti-human globalist system.
[00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.008]  And it's time to awaken others.
[00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:58.149]  The pushback starts now.
[00:37:59.773 --> 00:38:00.854]  Nick Fuentes is our guest.
[00:38:00.914 --> 00:38:04.977]  Please remember that there is an iron curtain of oppression and intimidation happening.
[00:38:05.818 --> 00:38:08.299]  And the more people submit, the worse it gets.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:08.880]  Push back.
[00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:11.962]  We're selling in-game blueprints for global enslavement.
[00:38:11.982 --> 00:38:18.607]  My seminal film predicts the whole Great Reset, the takeover, and how bad it gets the more you submit that it's so evergreen that it's been banned off Amazon.
[00:38:19.768 --> 00:38:20.469]  One copy, $14.95, you get
[00:38:22.554 --> 00:38:23.315]  A whole bunch of copies.
[00:38:23.335 --> 00:38:24.516]  They're $3.95 a piece.
[00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:26.078]  That way we get a few bucks each DVD.
[00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:27.460]  Help fund our operation.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.081]  I want you to make copies of it.
[00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:30.223]  It has no copy guard on it.
[00:38:30.503 --> 00:38:31.584]  It plays anywhere in the world.
[00:38:33.566 --> 00:38:33.887]  Endgame.
[00:38:33.907 --> 00:38:35.148]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:36.470]  And that's how we fund our operation.
[00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.311]  Also good news.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:45.803]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula sold out for almost six months, because we couldn't get it back in stock because of all the lockdowns and the supply chain breakdowns.
[00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:48.964]  95% Humanoid, back in stock, 50% off.
[00:38:49.484 --> 00:38:51.225]  Also VasoBeats for your heart and your liver.
[00:38:51.485 --> 00:38:53.926]  Concentrated compounds that create nitrous oxide in the blood.
[00:38:54.226 --> 00:38:55.026]  It's an amazing product.
[00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:55.986]  50% off.
[00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.867]  MFulwarestore.com.
[00:38:58.227 --> 00:38:59.468]  All of it boosts your immune system.
[00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:02.129]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Winter Sun, MFulwarestore.com.
[00:39:02.269 --> 00:39:07.871]  And then that funds Band.Video that is routinely getting millions of views for video.
[00:39:08.311 --> 00:39:11.814]  The average videos we upload, hundreds a day, gets about 20,000 views.
[00:39:12.415 --> 00:39:13.917]  Ladies and gentlemen, you built it.
[00:39:13.997 --> 00:39:14.958]  You fund the bandwidth.
[00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:21.664]  It's my invitation, because provocateurs will get on there and set us up, but I just offered Nick Fuentes a channel.
[00:39:21.884 --> 00:39:22.825]  He's being censored.
[00:39:22.845 --> 00:39:24.387]  He goes, of course I want a channel on Band Up Video.
[00:39:24.707 --> 00:39:27.989]  We'll make sure he gets a channel there and he brings all his great patriots there.
[00:39:28.049 --> 00:39:29.109]  We bring our patriots to him.
[00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:30.890]  We've got to get organized.
[00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.890]  We've got to get together.
[00:39:32.211 --> 00:39:33.631]  And so I want to get it done today.
[00:39:33.651 --> 00:39:36.392]  I want to get Nick Fuentes a page to upload everything he does.
[00:39:36.653 --> 00:39:38.033]  We're going to have live streaming soon.
[00:39:38.093 --> 00:39:40.955]  We're working on that for Band.Video as well.
[00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:46.697]  And again, Nick, give people the website where they can find you despite all the censorship.
[00:39:47.758 --> 00:39:52.280]  It is AmericaFirst.Live and Monday through Friday at 8 o'clock Central Time.
[00:39:52.904 --> 00:39:54.225]  America First dot live.
[00:39:54.285 --> 00:39:56.667]  And maybe we'll simulcast with you some tomorrow night.
[00:39:56.687 --> 00:40:01.230]  I'm going to cover the so-called State of the Union with the puppet in chief.
[00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.432]  So maybe we can do some simulcasting tomorrow night.
[00:40:03.472 --> 00:40:05.253]  We'll be going live, I think, what, 6 p.m.
[00:40:05.593 --> 00:40:06.193]  tomorrow evening.
[00:40:06.274 --> 00:40:06.494]  All right.
[00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:10.955]  In the eight minutes we have left, finishing up, Nick Fuentes is here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:11.635 --> 00:40:12.156]  Recap.
[00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:13.677]  You've been put on a no-fly list.
[00:40:13.697 --> 00:40:16.439]  They admitted it's because you were simply covering the Capitol.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.641]  What does that signify?
[00:40:19.122 --> 00:40:24.066]  Does that mean they're getting ready to try to arrest you for a conspiracy, even though you never called for any violence?
[00:40:24.086 --> 00:40:25.307]  That's preposterous.
[00:40:26.087 --> 00:40:27.689]  Or is it something else?
[00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:32.553]  Because I think it's all just part of this persecution of patriots in general.
[00:40:33.922 --> 00:40:35.183]  Well, you're exactly right.
[00:40:35.223 --> 00:40:49.994]  It's a part of a very coordinated and systematic effort to intimidate and persecute people that are against the Biden administration, people that are against the American regime, specifically Trump supporters and the leaders of Trump supporters, such as yourself and me and everybody that we know.
[00:40:50.074 --> 00:40:55.879]  And so it represents a major escalation because, of course, you know better than anybody almost that
[00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:58.582]  Censorship has been here for five years.
[00:40:59.002 --> 00:41:13.702]  We've been banned from social media, we've been banned from YouTube, banned from... You've been banned from Twitter, I'm still on there, but we've been banned from everything else, even back-end services, things like PayPal, Stripe, Email Octopus, MailChimp, you know, things that a lot of people don't even know that much about, and so...
[00:41:14.483 --> 00:41:17.684]  For a long time, it was really a variety of corporate tyranny.
[00:41:18.224 --> 00:41:24.805]  And the argument would be something like this from the left, which is, well, you have freedom of speech, but you don't have freedom from consequences.
[00:41:25.105 --> 00:41:32.546]  You have your right to exercise your First Amendment, and only insofar as the government is not oppressing you for that, well, then that's just par for the course.
[00:41:32.606 --> 00:41:36.747]  And so Twitter is a private company, and they can ban who they like for whatever they like.
[00:41:36.767 --> 00:41:42.228]  But now they've passed that Rubicon in a big way, and we know Europe and other areas of the model, they're coming with police now.
[00:41:43.382 --> 00:41:44.543]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:41:44.563 --> 00:41:46.264]  And they are the canary in the coal mine.
[00:41:46.305 --> 00:41:49.347]  It's been like that with hate speech legislation in Europe for a long time.
[00:41:49.647 --> 00:41:59.215]  And now with the Biden administration and Democrats with unified control of government, now you're seeing, just like you did under Barack Obama, the full weaponization of the federal government.
[00:41:59.436 --> 00:42:02.158]  And I used to tell this to people because there were a lot of people who would say to me,
[00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.831]  You know, I don't really feel like voting in 2020.
[00:42:05.592 --> 00:42:06.052]  I don't know.
[00:42:06.112 --> 00:42:07.493]  The wars aren't over, whatever.
[00:42:07.853 --> 00:42:13.256]  And I said, you watch and you see if Biden gets in office, it's going to be like Barack Obama on steroids.
[00:42:13.637 --> 00:42:23.303]  Remember when he was targeting the conservative nonprofits with the IRS and the back door gun control through the EPA and all kinds of other regulatory mechanisms to go after conservatives?
[00:42:23.923 --> 00:42:25.426]  It's going to be like that on steroids.
[00:42:25.446 --> 00:42:28.050]  Did you see that ominous statement by that one Democrat senator?
[00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.255]  He goes, we need to test the full power of the IRS.
[00:42:31.655 --> 00:42:34.459]  And the FBI said, we're going to break up these Patriot groups.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.446]  I mean, this is just KGB, GRU corruption.
[00:42:39.502 --> 00:42:57.305]  That's right, and they've taken the War on Terror, which has been waged over the past 20 years, and they built up all this legal infrastructure and bureaucratic infrastructure from the Patriot Act to the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA and the FBI, and all of this which has been built up ostensibly to go after
[00:42:58.101 --> 00:43:04.725]  Islamic terrorism in the Middle East to go after foreign adversaries since the capital is now being directed inwardly.
[00:43:04.745 --> 00:43:17.994]  And so now this panopticon surveillance state and the DHS and the Patriot Act and this abridgment of civil liberties, whereas once it applied to people that were foreigners, once it applied to people that were enemy combatants, I mean actual Muslim terrorists,
[00:43:18.394 --> 00:43:19.475]  And let's be clear.
[00:43:19.695 --> 00:43:21.356]  Real Muslim terrorists are coming across.
[00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:22.777]  The border wall's been cancelled.
[00:43:23.097 --> 00:43:24.278]  They're even taking part of it down.
[00:43:24.298 --> 00:43:25.878]  They're throwing babies over the fence.
[00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:32.902]  There's no infrastructure for the actual border, but now they're using illegal internal checkpoints on us and not letting patriots fly.
[00:43:32.922 --> 00:43:34.423]  I mean, this is pure intimidation.
[00:43:34.463 --> 00:43:35.784]  Like, oh, we demonetized you.
[00:43:36.064 --> 00:43:37.065]  Well, we banned you.
[00:43:37.305 --> 00:43:38.446]  Well, now you can't fly.
[00:43:38.686 --> 00:43:40.767]  Well, now you can't lease or rent.
[00:43:41.027 --> 00:43:42.208]  Now you can't have a bank account.
[00:43:42.368 --> 00:43:43.949]  They took the president's bank accounts!
[00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:47.224]  Exactly, and it's meant to disrupt.
[00:43:47.344 --> 00:43:48.968]  They want to achieve this effect.
[00:43:49.008 --> 00:43:50.011]  That is their intention.
[00:43:50.312 --> 00:43:53.419]  They disrupt our media landscape by banning us from social media.
[00:43:54.153 --> 00:43:57.875]  They disrupt us financially by freezing our bank accounts, which actually happened to me.
[00:43:57.915 --> 00:43:59.336]  They froze one of my bank accounts.
[00:43:59.676 --> 00:44:03.138]  And then now they're going to go and they're trying to stop people from flying.
[00:44:03.378 --> 00:44:05.920]  And, you know, Michael Sherwin said this on 60 Minutes.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.561]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:08.461]  This is not made up.
[00:44:08.881 --> 00:44:15.185]  Michael Sherwin, who is directing the capital investigation in D.C., he said on 60 Minutes and he actually got in trouble for it.
[00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:17.186]  He said the reason they went after the
[00:44:17.995 --> 00:44:28.023]  Internet celebrities and the people on social media first, when they were investigating the Capitol, was to create a shock and awe effect and prevent people from protesting the inauguration.
[00:44:28.063 --> 00:44:35.910]  Because he said that if people saw the mainstream people, the celebrities, getting hauled away by the FBI, then they would be intimidated into silence.
[00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.211]  And so this is part of a very coordinated campaign.
[00:44:38.572 --> 00:44:45.077]  They know that if they strike at people like yourself and people like me, if they strike at Donald Trump, take his bank accounts, take the social media,
[00:44:45.097 --> 00:44:49.904]  And let's be clear, the Republicans have signaled surrender, even though the public's awake.
[00:44:49.964 --> 00:44:50.985]  People totally like Trump.
[00:44:51.025 --> 00:44:51.967]  They love us.
[00:44:52.808 --> 00:44:54.951]  They've announced Lynne Cheney is now the leader of the party.
[00:44:55.251 --> 00:44:56.914]  Trump is not allowed at the strategy meetings.
[00:44:57.354 --> 00:44:58.616]  And she's going to run for president.
[00:44:58.676 --> 00:44:59.698]  CNN's worshipping her.
[00:44:59.958 --> 00:45:00.980]  They're saying she'll be the president.
[00:45:02.301 --> 00:45:12.569]  85% negative in her home state, hated across the nation, and now they're preparing to force-feed us Liz Cheney, just like they've done Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with half a percentage point approval rating with her.
[00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.251]  I mean, so this is unbelievable.
[00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:20.456]  That really, to me, is nightmarish signification that the Republicans are about to totally capitulate to the neocons that really run the Democrats.
[00:45:21.445 --> 00:45:30.428]  Yes, well, the Republicans, I mean, you know that they're salivating and they have been salivating to totally restore the Republican Party back to the status quo.
[00:45:30.748 --> 00:45:32.468]  They didn't like Trump in 2015.
[00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:33.428]  They didn't like him in 2016.
[00:45:33.468 --> 00:45:37.970]  And they had to put up with him for the past four years because he was the nucleus.
[00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.770]  He was the center.
[00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:53.021]  Of gravity in DC and the Republican Party, but you know that Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and Mitt Romney's niece, Ronna McDaniel, they have been chomping at the bit for Donald Trump to leave office so that they could snap right back to the old GOP.
[00:45:53.081 --> 00:45:54.121]  And that's why they're boosting.
[00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:58.585]  That's why Tim Scott is going to do the response to the joint session of Congress tomorrow.
[00:45:59.245 --> 00:46:02.526]  That's why Nikki Haley is the one that they're grooming to be the president.
[00:46:02.766 --> 00:46:04.907]  And you're right, that's why Liz Cheney is running the party.
[00:46:05.267 --> 00:46:11.349]  And that's why they're trying to go after Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz in the America First Caucus.
[00:46:11.689 --> 00:46:17.550]  It's because the Republican Party, George W. Bush the other day working with the Koch Network to pass amnesty with Joe Biden.
[00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.871]  The entire Republican infrastructure
[00:46:20.609 --> 00:46:25.872]  Is coagulating now with the Democratic Party in the open to put down this populist revolt.
[00:46:26.113 --> 00:46:30.715]  To put down the, you know, insurrection in a political sense, not in a literal sense.
[00:46:30.736 --> 00:46:32.256]  The point is, how do we counter this?
[00:46:32.637 --> 00:46:34.878]  Governors, legislators, leaders like DeSantis.
[00:46:35.198 --> 00:46:36.999]  I mean, we've got to go on the offense politically.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.181]  This is, if this was a liquor, it's 200 proof tyranny.
[00:46:40.502 --> 00:46:43.924]  I mean, this is 100% admitted evil cancer.
[00:46:44.524 --> 00:46:45.445]  This is unbelievable.
[00:46:46.784 --> 00:46:49.345]  Well, the way to go on the offensive is in the state governments.
[00:46:49.605 --> 00:46:52.966]  Republicans control more than half of the state governments in the country.
[00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:59.669]  Ron DeSantis seems to be the only one that's cognizant of that fact, because he seems to be the only one that's fighting against the left-wing agenda.
[00:47:00.009 --> 00:47:04.831]  Christine Noem in South Dakota votes the NCAA on trans, so does the Arkansas governor.
[00:47:05.351 --> 00:47:10.838]  We have got to take these Republican state governments if we don't have a shot right now in Congress and in the White House.
[00:47:10.858 --> 00:47:12.019]  We need people that aren't wimps.
[00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:15.383]  I mean, Arkansas, 90% of people don't want men in women's sports.
[00:47:15.743 --> 00:47:17.486]  In the Dakotas, 90% don't want it.
[00:47:17.686 --> 00:47:18.367]  It's popular.
[00:47:18.387 --> 00:47:19.748]  Feminists hate it.
[00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:22.271]  Oh, everyone, oh no, I'll let men compete.
[00:47:22.311 --> 00:47:23.973]  Do five more minutes with us on more solutions.
[00:47:24.273 --> 00:47:25.155]  I totally concur.
[00:47:25.695 --> 00:47:30.699]  Plus, as Julius Caesar said, there is a tide in the affairs of men taken to the flood that leads to fortune.
[00:47:31.019 --> 00:47:32.360]  Our fortune is just living free.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.081]  People like DeSantis get it.
[00:47:34.362 --> 00:47:38.945]  How do we draft some people that aren't total coward idiots to take this thing head on?
[00:47:39.025 --> 00:47:40.066]  My God!
[00:47:40.406 --> 00:47:41.467]  Our children are worth it.
[00:47:41.707 --> 00:47:43.549]  Not a bunch of communists gut the country.
[00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:45.110]  Nick Fuentes is our guest.
[00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.852]  Soon he will have a Band.Video account.
[00:47:48.593 --> 00:48:00.529]  Oh, and if you're another patriot out there that's been banned out there, email RobD, R-O-B-D, just the letter D, at InfoWars.com, and the intrepid Rob Do will get you signed up on Banned.TV.
[00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.772]  If you think we're joking around about the tyranny...
[00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:17.393]  I see dozens of articles a day, and it's all standardized around the world, where the police come and arrest preachers for having events, but a topless bar is open down the street, where they're arresting reporters, arresting medical doctors that criticize the lockdowns.
[00:48:17.473 --> 00:48:19.055]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:22.499]  Nick Foyntes, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.162]  Again, you're just an America First activist.
[00:48:25.182 --> 00:48:25.942]  You're well-spoken.
[00:48:26.363 --> 00:48:28.585]  So you've been censored and now you're on a no-fly list.
[00:48:29.366 --> 00:48:35.052]  I bet money, actually, if I try to go fly, I'm going to be blocked as well, even though I was there trying to stop people going in.
[00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.094]  And then there's no judge or jury, no court.
[00:48:37.174 --> 00:48:40.517]  You just, it's a magic, you know, thing with a godlike FBI.
[00:48:41.338 --> 00:48:48.204]  Uh, that they waved a wand and said no longer is there background checks needed for who children are given to, including convicted pedophiles.
[00:48:48.284 --> 00:48:49.425]  So they are God.
[00:48:49.465 --> 00:48:51.746]  I guess I should pray to the FBI, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:48:51.767 --> 00:48:52.627]  I know that's blasphemy.
[00:48:53.007 --> 00:48:54.569]  Uh, but so, so how do we counter this, Nick?
[00:48:56.092 --> 00:49:02.456]  So I think the easiest way for Republicans to do this is to take advantage of the control that they have in the state legislatures.
[00:49:02.516 --> 00:49:03.997]  And, you know, it's pretty bewildering.
[00:49:04.017 --> 00:49:07.499]  We have control over more than half of the state legislatures in the country.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.921]  And we witnessed this in the 2020 election.
[00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:13.844]  I know you and I were on the front lines for Stop the Steal in Atlanta and across the country.
[00:49:14.324 --> 00:49:17.186]  We realized that these Republican state legislatures and governors
[00:49:17.806 --> 00:49:21.689]  Are just totally incompetent, totally ineffective, and unwilling to do what's right.
[00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:27.474]  In Phoenix, in Atlanta, in Harrisburg, in Madison, in all these different state capitals.
[00:49:27.534 --> 00:49:31.578]  In Lansing, they refused to adjudicate the 2020 election.
[00:49:31.618 --> 00:49:38.823]  And now we see that they're folding, like you said before the break, folding on trans, folding on big tech, folding on all the issues that matter.
[00:49:38.863 --> 00:49:45.329]  So I propose that, look, you take a look at South Dakota or Arkansas, where their two governors just totally folded on trans.
[00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:47.770]  Those are hardcore conservative states.
[00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:55.395]  Like you said, 90% of the people in those places were against transgender athletes in the women's sports, but the governors vetoed it.
[00:49:55.895 --> 00:50:01.878]  Why don't we just take states like that where we can win and fill them up in the state legislature with people that are America first?
[00:50:01.918 --> 00:50:11.224]  Because, you know, we have a thing in the country called federalism, where there's not only a separation of powers between the branches of federal government, but between the federal government and the state government.
[00:50:11.524 --> 00:50:13.645]  And actually, the state governments have far more
[00:50:14.392 --> 00:50:22.743]  Constitutional jurisdiction than the federal government because the federal government's powers are enumerated and the state government's powers and the Tenth Amendment get everything else.
[00:50:23.163 --> 00:50:33.156]  So I look at somebody like Ron DeSantis as the model for what we have to pursue in the future, which is America first governors, America first state legislators, because
[00:50:33.616 --> 00:50:35.358]  That is a power source.
[00:50:35.398 --> 00:50:47.091]  That's a locus of power that Republicans can wield in these conservative areas and begin to fight back against the tech censorship, begin to fight back against the tide of this social revolution that's transforming the country.
[00:50:47.431 --> 00:50:48.953]  We can do it using state government.
[00:50:48.973 --> 00:50:52.357]  The problem is that people have been unwilling to do that, and we all know that.
[00:50:52.457 --> 00:50:53.118]  Everybody's got
[00:50:53.778 --> 00:50:54.739]  An unpopular governor.
[00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:56.239]  I live in Illinois.
[00:50:56.259 --> 00:50:56.780]  We have J.B.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.200]  Pritzker.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.242]  But honestly, it's not much better in Georgia with Brian Kemp, who's a Republican.
[00:51:01.302 --> 00:51:02.563]  Not much better in Arizona.
[00:51:02.583 --> 00:51:04.364]  And look, the globalists want to conquer us, Nick.
[00:51:04.404 --> 00:51:05.905]  It's only going to get worse until we push back.
[00:51:05.965 --> 00:51:06.705]  Take California.
[00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:09.346]  I've known for a long time that it's never really went blue.
[00:51:09.406 --> 00:51:10.367]  It's been election fraud.
[00:51:11.107 --> 00:51:12.048]  That's what Democrats do.
[00:51:12.548 --> 00:51:13.689]  People are voting with their feet.
[00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:17.591]  Now they've gotten all these signatures to recall their fake governor.
[00:51:17.851 --> 00:51:20.192]  So we can also push back within states they control.
[00:51:20.212 --> 00:51:21.353]  I think that's a great point you're making.
[00:51:22.654 --> 00:51:23.214]  Absolutely.
[00:51:23.294 --> 00:51:25.295]  And you're exactly right about California.
[00:51:25.335 --> 00:51:28.955]  You know, the thing about Republicans is they're very much on the defensive.
[00:51:29.215 --> 00:51:30.636]  The Democrats are on the offensive.
[00:51:30.656 --> 00:51:34.177]  They're filling up all the Republican states with immigrants and they're pursuing voter fraud.
[00:51:34.577 --> 00:51:37.457]  I mean, they set out to flip Georgia and they got it.
[00:51:37.477 --> 00:51:40.858]  A lot of people said that's impossible, but they played it very aggressively and they got it.
[00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:44.159]  And I don't think we should limit ourselves even to these kinds of places.
[00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:45.099]  We should be looking at
[00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:46.491]  California.
[00:51:46.511 --> 00:51:50.172]  We should be looking at other states, even states like Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado.
[00:51:50.212 --> 00:51:52.872]  I think it's still possible to make a difference there, too.
[00:51:53.272 --> 00:51:55.333]  But in these Republican strongholds, there's no excuse.
[00:51:55.353 --> 00:51:56.573]  There's no excuse in Texas.
[00:51:56.833 --> 00:52:02.014]  There's no excuse in Arkansas or South Dakota to not have a totally America-first conservative government.
[00:52:02.214 --> 00:52:03.274]  We've got to have it there.
[00:52:03.374 --> 00:52:06.115]  And we, as people living in these states, have to demand it.
[00:52:06.375 --> 00:52:07.835]  We don't have to win the presidency.
[00:52:07.855 --> 00:52:08.995]  We don't have to win these things.
[00:52:09.615 --> 00:52:10.356]  That would be nice.
[00:52:10.436 --> 00:52:12.356]  And, you know, ultimately, we'd like to do those things.
[00:52:12.436 --> 00:52:12.536]  But
[00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:14.295]  We don't have to do that.
[00:52:14.615 --> 00:52:18.877]  We can still do something in the meantime before the midterms and before the next presidential election.
[00:52:19.137 --> 00:52:20.818]  So I say take a look at Ron DeSantis.
[00:52:21.058 --> 00:52:23.700]  That's got to be the model for every Republican governor in the country.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.340]  Beautifully said.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.861]  You're a voice that needs to be said.
[00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:27.762]  You're the model for people as well.
[00:52:28.122 --> 00:52:29.383]  We need to get your voice out there.
[00:52:29.403 --> 00:52:31.104]  I can't wait for you to be uploading to Band Off Video.
[00:52:31.404 --> 00:52:32.345]  Let's make sure that happens.
[00:52:32.385 --> 00:52:34.085]  Nick, you've got my number written down in a day or so.
[00:52:34.146 --> 00:52:34.386]  Call me.
[00:52:34.406 --> 00:52:35.726]  I want to make sure that happens.
[00:52:35.947 --> 00:52:36.927]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:52:37.327 --> 00:52:40.209]  How do people find your weeknight show that's so censored and so banned?
[00:52:41.112 --> 00:52:44.396]  It's at AmericaFirst.live, 8 o'clock central, Monday through Friday.
[00:52:44.436 --> 00:52:46.078]  And thank you so much for having me on.
[00:52:46.218 --> 00:52:46.899]  Love what you do.
[00:52:47.019 --> 00:52:47.640]  You're a legend.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.381]  We love you, brother.
[00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:49.002]  I'll be right back.
[00:52:50.403 --> 00:52:53.227]  The fact that you're tuned into this transmission means you're awake.
[00:52:53.287 --> 00:52:54.188]  It means you're informed.
[00:52:54.568 --> 00:52:57.912]  It means you're involved and you want to save yourself and your family.
[00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:01.305]  My friends, we're all in this together, but I can tell you this right now.
[00:53:01.725 --> 00:53:11.492]  Get in a survivalist mindset while you still can, and get firearms to protect yourself, water filtration, friends and family you can trust, and storable foods while you still can.
[00:53:11.792 --> 00:53:23.700]  We've got the best company ready to ship to you within 24 hours at mfullmorestore.com and the lowest price, not just on MyPatriot, but 10% lower exclusively at mfullmorestore.com.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.363]  If you can't find the subsection that has the food, just go to preparewithalex.com.
[00:53:28.143 --> 00:53:32.967]  Well, a lot of people throw around the word hero, and I think it gets overused, but our guest, Artur Palowski, is a hero.
[00:53:33.007 --> 00:53:33.227]  He has a
[00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:56.291]  Street ministry that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week in his city.
[00:53:56.852 --> 00:54:03.394]  And he has a church, a small church, that also serves hundreds of people a week.
[00:54:03.494 --> 00:54:07.896]  And you've seen the footage from Easter Sunday, them coming without a warrant, without anything.
[00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:10.637]  And saying, we're going to enforce social distancing.
[00:54:10.657 --> 00:54:12.417]  We're going to enforce all of this.
[00:54:12.457 --> 00:54:13.258]  It's all a bunch of crap.
[00:54:13.298 --> 00:54:14.218]  It's all unconstitutional.
[00:54:14.558 --> 00:54:15.679]  And he said, get out of here, get out of here.
[00:54:15.699 --> 00:54:16.499]  We'll play a clip in a moment.
[00:54:16.699 --> 00:54:17.779]  He'll be with us for much of the hour.
[00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:21.721]  Well, they came back, ladies and gentlemen, the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:22.901]  This happened just a few days ago.
[00:54:22.941 --> 00:54:28.243]  Canadian police return with SWAT team to local church run by Artur Polosky.
[00:54:28.843 --> 00:54:36.828]  Now I got a chance to hear him last week or a couple weeks ago actually on the War Room and also on American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:38.449]  Very impressed with him.
[00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:40.891]  But he went through communism.
[00:54:40.931 --> 00:54:45.634]  He went through this exact type of crap and helped get his parents out of Poland.
[00:54:45.654 --> 00:54:53.039]  And that's why you don't see Joe Biden wanting a bunch of Poles to move over here because they tend to vote more conservative because they've been through it just like Cubans do.
[00:54:53.759 --> 00:54:57.783]  So, Artur, Pastor Holowski, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:54:57.823 --> 00:55:04.908]  We're going to go to you in just a moment, but I want to roll here some of what happened on Easter and then some of what happened this last Sunday.
[00:55:04.928 --> 00:55:06.450]  So, we'll play these back-to-back.
[00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:06.890]  Here it is.
[00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:08.831]  Please get out.
[00:55:09.432 --> 00:55:11.213]  Get out of this property immediately.
[00:55:11.253 --> 00:55:11.654]  Get out.
[00:55:12.855 --> 00:55:15.657]  Get out of this property immediately.
[00:55:16.117 --> 00:55:16.257]  Out.
[00:55:16.478 --> 00:55:17.578]  I don't want to hear anything.
[00:55:17.859 --> 00:55:19.460]  Out of this property immediately.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.481]  I don't want to hear a word.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.303]  Out of this property!
[00:55:25.964 --> 00:55:28.589]  Immediately until you come back with a warrant.
[00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:29.070]  Out!
[00:55:30.473 --> 00:55:30.774]  Out!
[00:55:31.816 --> 00:55:31.996]  Out!
[00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:36.028]  This goes on for ten minutes all the way out into the street off the property.
[00:55:36.128 --> 00:55:38.228]  Now, this is what happened again just a few days ago.
[00:55:38.548 --> 00:55:39.768]  They've been back several times.
[00:55:40.148 --> 00:55:47.310]  There's other churches where you've seen hundreds of police, drones, fences around the churches, while Walmarts a mile and a half away are just jam-packed with people.
[00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:48.630]  Total evil.
[00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:55.732]  Testing to see if they can go after churches with the leader of Canada saying, I want a dictatorship like communist China.
[00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:56.232]  That's a quote.
[00:55:56.572 --> 00:55:57.772]  We'll play that clip, come up with our guest.
[00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.692]  Here's a little piece of what happened this Sunday.
[00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:01.913]  Well friends, we have a SWAT team.
[00:56:03.214 --> 00:56:04.314]  In our church again.
[00:56:05.255 --> 00:56:05.655]  Coming.
[00:56:06.115 --> 00:56:06.795]  Authorities.
[00:56:07.615 --> 00:56:10.216]  So I'm going to go out and see what they want.
[00:56:16.198 --> 00:56:16.458]  Yes?
[00:56:16.678 --> 00:56:17.038]  Hello, Walter.
[00:56:17.619 --> 00:56:18.039]  Hi, Arthur.
[00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:20.800]  I was wondering if I could just give you a couple of clues on the court order.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.220]  This is for you.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:28.142]  It basically outlines the fact that we have the right to enter today.
[00:56:29.442 --> 00:56:30.203]  What I would really
[00:56:31.713 --> 00:56:31.993]  Please.
[00:56:32.474 --> 00:56:33.854]  I don't have to get into her personal space.
[00:56:34.115 --> 00:56:34.335]  Thank you.
[00:56:34.355 --> 00:56:38.057]  Well, you're in my personal space, so... Can I explain to you, Arthur?
[00:56:38.377 --> 00:56:40.719]  I'm not really interested in what you have to say.
[00:56:40.999 --> 00:56:41.919]  Can I explain to you?
[00:56:42.139 --> 00:56:42.920]  I'm reading.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:43.520]  Okay.
[00:56:43.941 --> 00:56:44.221]  Okay.
[00:56:46.941 --> 00:56:51.682]  The full video is up at InfoWars.com and on Artur Polosky's site as well.
[00:56:52.102 --> 00:56:58.744]  Website StreetChurch.ca and Artur Polosky TV on YouTube.
[00:56:58.984 --> 00:57:01.205]  And that's P-A-W-L-O-W-S-K-A-R-T-U-R-P-O-L-O-W-S-K.
[00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:02.365]  Aye.
[00:57:03.206 --> 00:57:04.346]  And he joins us down.
[00:57:04.366 --> 00:57:05.086]  I love the liberal.
[00:57:05.287 --> 00:57:09.008]  Oh, please, please just let us, you know, we're just here to save you.
[00:57:09.248 --> 00:57:12.310]  We're just here to... No, they're setting the precedent to permanently shut everything down.
[00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:13.570]  It's in the Great Reset.
[00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:14.211]  That's the plan.
[00:57:14.551 --> 00:57:16.672]  So I'm trying to give you the floor to start wherever you want.
[00:57:17.532 --> 00:57:21.735]  And go through all this, your experience in Poland, your powerful warning to all of us today.
[00:57:21.755 --> 00:57:25.458]  I know you've been doing a lot of interviews, and we're just so thankful that you're out there fighting, Pastor.
[00:57:25.478 --> 00:57:28.780]  And if I lived near you, I'd drive 50 miles to attend your church.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.563]  I can just feel the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, through the Skype right now.
[00:57:32.643 --> 00:57:37.486]  So God bless you, brother, for being a leader for us all as we fight this demonic takeover.
[00:57:37.506 --> 00:57:38.227]  You've got the floor.
[00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:42.410]  We're going to break in about six minutes, but you're going to have the floor for as long as you want to stay with us this hour.
[00:57:43.817 --> 00:57:44.697]  Thank you very much, sir.
[00:57:44.737 --> 00:57:47.338]  Thank you very much for standing with us and supporting us.
[00:57:47.398 --> 00:57:52.919]  I mean, I received tens of thousands of emails and texts, and mostly from Americans.
[00:57:52.999 --> 00:57:57.960]  So I'm very, very glad that my brothers and sisters across the border are rising up.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.601]  We are to be lions, and lions never bow before the hyenas.
[00:58:02.781 --> 00:58:04.922]  Lions never bow before the wolves.
[00:58:05.002 --> 00:58:06.862]  And that's what those people are, the wannabe
[00:58:07.342 --> 00:58:09.184]  Dictators and you're absolutely right.
[00:58:09.264 --> 00:58:13.067]  I am fired up and I'm angry because I grew up behind the Iron Curtain.
[00:58:13.368 --> 00:58:16.851]  I've seen this movie before and it doesn't end well.
[00:58:17.331 --> 00:58:19.994]  They will destroy everything if you let them.
[00:58:20.094 --> 00:58:22.716]  They will remove every right that you have.
[00:58:23.156 --> 00:58:25.418]  It doesn't matter if you have your constitution or not.
[00:58:25.799 --> 00:58:33.606]  Poland from 1945 had all those years a constitution, the highest law in the country, but communists, fascists,
[00:58:34.381 --> 00:58:39.891]  Dictators do not care about your rights and your charter rights and freedoms and your constitution.
[00:58:39.991 --> 00:58:40.913]  They are stripping
[00:58:42.261 --> 00:58:44.342]  And the church is the biggest resistance.
[00:58:44.382 --> 00:58:48.483]  It has always been the biggest resistance towards dictatorship and tyranny.
[00:58:48.783 --> 00:58:52.464]  Now we have the medical tyranny being pushed on us left and right.
[00:58:52.784 --> 00:58:53.544]  And we have a choice.
[00:58:53.624 --> 00:59:01.047]  We can stand against that or we can allow them to destroy our way of life, destroy our faith.
[00:59:01.367 --> 00:59:07.128]  So my message to Americans is we have still a window of opportunity to push this evil away.
[00:59:07.348 --> 00:59:08.889]  We still have a chance.
[00:59:09.329 --> 00:59:18.714]  To stand up against the tyrants that want to be dictators like Biden, like our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, that is fascinated.
[00:59:18.814 --> 00:59:24.077]  And he said it on record that he wished he would have a dictatorship like China.
[00:59:24.117 --> 00:59:29.360]  Can you imagine Chinese government murdering millions of people on a regular basis?
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:37.405]  And the Prime Minister in a free and democratic country says that he would wish to be, you know, Chinese Prime Minister.
[00:59:38.197 --> 00:59:43.201]  So, they're coming with the warrants, they're coming with a SWAT team, can you imagine, to a peaceful assembly?
[00:59:43.582 --> 00:59:54.571]  I have been doing this for 22 years, I have no record of violence, and they're bringing a SWAT team, the gang suppression team, to a peaceful assembly, and excuse me, for what?
[00:59:54.892 --> 00:59:58.915]  To find out if we are wearing a mask, if I'm preaching wearing a muzzle?
[00:59:59.175 --> 01:00:03.059]  I'm not a dog, I'm not their servant, I am a taxpayer,
[01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:07.723]  And I demand that those people represent me and serve me.
[01:00:08.064 --> 01:00:09.525]  That's what we're paying them for.
[01:00:09.545 --> 01:00:11.307]  We're not paying them to remove our rights away.
[01:00:11.527 --> 01:00:13.509]  We're paying them to uphold our rights.
[01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:20.356]  And lately, they have total disregard to the Constitution, total disregard to our rights and freedoms.
[01:00:20.956 --> 01:00:22.196]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:00:22.436 --> 01:00:27.378]  Are we going to just crawl into a hole and cry out and say there's nothing we can do?
[01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:40.462]  I have a message to them and I hope that more pastors, more priests, more rabbis will rise up, more politicians and free lovers, freedom lovers will say first no and then get out.
[01:00:40.722 --> 01:00:42.722]  Only those three words you need to say.
[01:00:43.183 --> 01:00:46.063]  No, I'm not complying to whatever you're pushing.
[01:00:46.204 --> 01:00:47.564]  I'm not bowing before you.
[01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:58.852]  I say no to you and get out, get out of my businesses, get out of our churches, get out of our political arena, get out of our media, get out of our educational system.
[01:00:58.952 --> 01:01:06.578]  I mean, if we're not going to say no and get out now, mark my words, listen to the guy that grew up under a communist dictatorship.
[01:01:06.938 --> 01:01:11.021]  They will keep coming and they will be taking more rights.
[01:01:11.221 --> 01:01:16.665]  They're cutting us by a thousand cuts, slowly removing one little law at a time.
[01:01:16.686 --> 01:01:17.286]  And there are
[01:01:19.838 --> 01:01:20.679]  How are you going to react?
[01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:21.819]  They're testing you.
[01:01:22.239 --> 01:01:23.060]  Will you stand up?
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.142]  Will you allow us to take everything away from you?
[01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.103]  Or will there be uprising?
[01:01:28.123 --> 01:01:29.464]  And I'm not talking about BLM.
[01:01:30.606 --> 01:01:34.590]  Style, I'm not talking about Antifa, terrorist style.
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.172]  I'm talking about peaceful resistance.
[01:01:36.232 --> 01:01:37.733]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:01:38.074 --> 01:01:41.817]  non-compliance, saying to them no and taking it to the streets.
[01:01:41.917 --> 01:01:43.499]  Big rallies, big protests.
[01:01:43.799 --> 01:01:49.485]  I'm calling right now people to come to our church this Saturday, 9.30 in the morning.
[01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.807]  Come, let there be thousands of people.
[01:01:52.228 --> 01:01:53.129]  Let's see what those
[01:01:53.769 --> 01:01:59.934]  Fascist wannabe dictators, the Gestapo wannabe people are going to do when thousands of people are going to show up.
[01:01:59.954 --> 01:02:00.754]  Let's talk about this.
[01:02:00.774 --> 01:02:02.736]  What do you think of Grace Life in Calgary?
[01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:13.424]  A big church where they put up two fences around it, a black tarp like it was evil, like it was pornography or something, and spent millions of dollars it looks like to do this.
[01:02:13.804 --> 01:02:15.025]  It's like the Berlin Wall.
[01:02:15.045 --> 01:02:16.646]  They're literally walling off churches.
[01:02:16.926 --> 01:02:20.549]  These are obviously sick evil people testing to see what they can get away with.
[01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:21.770]  Like you said, it is a test.
[01:02:23.177 --> 01:02:23.757]  It is a test.
[01:02:23.837 --> 01:02:27.739]  It's Edmonton, actually, so it's the next big city in the province of Alberta.
[01:02:28.099 --> 01:02:28.559]  It's a test.
[01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:29.460]  They're testing us.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.340]  They're testing what the pastors will do.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.161]  They're testing what the Christians are going to do.
[01:02:33.521 --> 01:02:40.344]  They are testing us, and we have to send a very clear and strong, aggressive message to them that we're not going to bow down.
[01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:41.765]  We're not their slaves.
[01:02:42.065 --> 01:02:46.367]  We're not going to submit to their evil, unconstitutional laws.
[01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:49.128]  Now it's the time to rise up, stand up, and push.
[01:02:49.328 --> 01:02:51.509]  We're hiring very powerful criminal lawyers.
[01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:57.350]  To take this to courts, of course, but in the meantime, we need the boots on the streets.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.511]  We need the people to send messages.
[01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:02.892]  This is as big as the Germans taking down the Berlin Wall.
[01:03:02.932 --> 01:03:05.612]  It's as big as what happened in Poland, I guess.
[01:03:05.652 --> 01:03:06.532]  Was that Perestroika?
[01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:11.434]  And so to be clear, you're in Calgary, the other church is in Alberta, but this is happening all over the country.
[01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:12.294]  Give us a report on that.
[01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:13.114]  It's happening in Australia.
[01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:13.674]  It's happening in Australia.
[01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:14.215]  It's happening in Germany.
[01:03:14.255 --> 01:03:15.196]  It's happening in France.
[01:03:15.236 --> 01:03:15.876]  It's happening in England.
[01:03:16.116 --> 01:03:17.357]  It's happening all over the world.
[01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.119]  It's the UN directing it.
[01:03:19.259 --> 01:03:20.940]  Artur Palowski is our guest.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.623]  He's the pastor there in Canada, streetchurch.ca.
[01:03:24.924 --> 01:03:26.165]  He is the model of victory.
[01:03:26.185 --> 01:03:26.725]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:28.266 --> 01:03:40.997]  Ronald Reagan, back in 1989, right as he was leaving office, said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.
[01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:49.404]  Well, I say, like he said in 88 was the year, not Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.
[01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:57.687]  I say, Puppet Biden, tear off that mask off your dirty bandit face and tell people to take it off the face of children everywhere.
[01:03:57.747 --> 01:03:58.468]  This is a cult.
[01:03:58.868 --> 01:03:59.868]  This is a programming.
[01:03:59.888 --> 01:04:01.349]  This is a peer pressure system.
[01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:07.171]  This is a desperate big pharma UN operation that says it wants communism.
[01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:08.912]  And the EU took much of the old
[01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:16.486]  Bureaucrats from the Eastern Bloc and has put most of them in charge of the unelected EU Council.
[01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:19.068]  So the voting in the EU is only ceremonial.
[01:04:19.348 --> 01:04:25.493]  It is the permanent council like the Politburo in Communist China that actually runs the show.
[01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:26.394]  So...
[01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:38.470]  Pastor Artur Poloski of StreetChurch.ca has a big street church serving over a thousand homeless people every week, and he also has his other church, Cave of Adullam.
[01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.012]  Maybe he'll tell us what that means biblically.
[01:04:40.472 --> 01:04:42.554]  But this is a shorter segment, a long segment coming up.
[01:04:43.735 --> 01:04:50.200]  Go wherever you want, but the historical parallels here of your family, of Poland, of what you guys went through.
[01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:59.147]  Can you impart that to us so we understand, those of us that haven't gone through something like this, what's going to happen if we keep following along with this program?
[01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:08.994]  Because for those that don't know, this is all UN, EU, Big Tech, Davos Group run, and they admit the EU model is the model, and that was the old Soviet bloc model.
[01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:09.995]  Please enlighten us.
[01:05:11.681 --> 01:05:12.082]  Exactly.
[01:05:12.102 --> 01:05:13.123]  You're absolutely right.
[01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:24.040]  What we're seeing is the biggest distraction or elimination, if you will, of the middle class, small and medium sized businesses, because in order to control society, you have to take away their
[01:05:24.864 --> 01:05:25.104]  I think?
[01:05:54.827 --> 01:05:56.609]  Give me the man, I will find you the crime!
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:19.325]  That's exactly the famous saying from the police during the Soviets during the occupation behind the Iron Curtain.
[01:06:19.765 --> 01:06:24.428]  They could come into your house five in the morning, break the door and beat you up, torture you.
[01:06:24.508 --> 01:06:28.691]  Many people were arrested and tortured just for listening to a European radio.
[01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:32.054]  That's why you have this propaganda machinery in full force.
[01:06:32.194 --> 01:06:38.278]  That's why there is censorship, the platforming of another voice, because they don't want you to hear the truth.
[01:06:38.318 --> 01:06:41.740]  Because we know as Christians that the truth sets the captives free.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.262]  Here I have a quote here from Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:06:45.282 --> 01:06:46.083]  and that's what I'm saying.
[01:06:46.123 --> 01:06:53.907]  What we need is this type of resistance, non-compliance, going to the streets, saying to the elites, we will not comply, we will not work with you.
[01:06:54.207 --> 01:06:57.589]  And here is what he said from jail, Biringman Jail.
[01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:00.811]  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
[01:07:05.314 --> 01:07:10.097]  Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.
[01:07:10.337 --> 01:07:11.257]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:12.478]  First they came for me.
[01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:13.838]  Be sure of it.
[01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:14.879]  Be sure of it.
[01:07:15.019 --> 01:07:17.640]  They will come for you because that's their pattern.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.341]  That's what history is teaching us.
[01:07:19.621 --> 01:07:20.382]  They're testing.
[01:07:20.422 --> 01:07:21.042]  They're coming.
[01:07:21.342 --> 01:07:22.663]  They're coming for me today.
[01:07:22.783 --> 01:07:23.083]  Yes.
[01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:26.485]  And they think that I have no means to defend myself.
[01:07:26.525 --> 01:07:31.547]  That's why I'm very grateful to you and others to expose this level of corruption.
[01:07:32.328 --> 01:07:34.569]  So what is the solution?
[01:07:36.567 --> 01:07:36.807]  Yes.
[01:07:59.634 --> 01:08:09.662]  Stalin even said they did that on purpose, and Lenin, and then of course it spread to Poland and everywhere else, because they said, we want to keep them so desperate for little things, they don't worry about everything else we've taken from them.
[01:08:09.902 --> 01:08:17.768]  And then Bernie Sanders, remember, three years ago said, there's too much in the stores, too many food, too many deodorants, too many choices.
[01:08:18.048 --> 01:08:19.069]  He doesn't like that.
[01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.570]  He can't control it.
[01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:24.333]  And he is an admitted communist who honeymoons in the Soviet Union.
[01:08:25.626 --> 01:08:26.246]  Exactly.
[01:08:26.306 --> 01:08:29.828]  Because to control a society, you need to control the food supply.
[01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:36.270]  When you control the food supply, you created a nation of slaves that are being ruled by those tyrants.
[01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:38.791]  And I'll prove it to you by what we're seeing right now.
[01:08:38.871 --> 01:08:40.112]  Walmarts, Ikea.
[01:08:40.452 --> 01:08:44.433]  In Ikea, before you go over there, it says only 400 people, 480 people allowed.
[01:08:44.473 --> 01:08:45.834]  You got hundreds of people in the parking lots.
[01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:46.254]  You
[01:08:49.184 --> 01:08:56.267]  You've got Walmarts filled with people shoulder to shoulder, but I cannot have my parents for coffee in my house.
[01:08:56.347 --> 01:08:57.308]  That's against the law.
[01:08:57.428 --> 01:09:05.631]  I cannot have a church because that's against the law, but I can go with my church, with my friends, with my family members to Ikea and have a coffee over there.
[01:09:05.711 --> 01:09:06.672]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:09:06.752 --> 01:09:11.114]  Why don't you guys go to Walmart, say you're going, go in and then hold a church service there.
[01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.094]  You'll be allowed to.
[01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:13.975]  Of course, then they'll throw you out, but that'd be a great stunt.
[01:09:15.137 --> 01:09:36.333]  Yes, so I already said to the authorities if they're going to shut down, if they're going to pull a stunt like they did to the Grace Life Church and fence our church, the next move is going to be me popping up every week in a different place and holding church services in the places that are allowed in front of the mayor's house, in front of the chief of police house, in front of the health inspector's house.
[01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.615]  I'm going to be going all over the place.
[01:09:38.735 --> 01:09:39.095]  I think?
[01:10:02.174 --> 01:10:15.084]  The Great Reset admits they want to bankrupt you to put you on a monthly ration, a quote, guaranteed income.
[01:10:15.324 --> 01:10:16.766]  You already enjoyed that in Poland.
[01:10:16.986 --> 01:10:20.048]  Didn't matter how much you worked, you still didn't get any money.
[01:10:20.088 --> 01:10:22.290]  You had the little ration card they gave you.
[01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:26.393]  They admit that's what they want for the carbon footprint is global ration cards.
[01:10:26.433 --> 01:10:27.254]  That's the Great Reset.
[01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:28.892]  Food stamps.
[01:10:28.972 --> 01:10:36.242]  I mean, people have no idea what we're talking about because Americans and Canadians, they experienced food stamps during the second war.
[01:10:36.302 --> 01:10:43.131]  But I grew up in 1970s and 80s in a country that you couldn't just go to a store, even if you had the money, you
[01:10:43.131 --> 01:10:47.332]  You had to only buy, you were allowed only to buy what the food stamp was saying.
[01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:52.094]  So everything was under the table, was run, the country was run by bribes.
[01:10:52.434 --> 01:11:00.337]  You had to bribe the police, you had to bribe the clerics, you had to bribe the doctors, nurses, you had to bribe the teachers, politicians.
[01:11:00.437 --> 01:11:02.258]  I mean, it was a sick system.
[01:11:02.518 --> 01:11:08.460]  And by the way, they had huge orphanages, people starving, took a very successful country and just gutted the hell out of it.
[01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:10.693]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:11:10.994 --> 01:11:22.185]  And every country that you actually look what is going on, when the communists and socialists takes over, it bankrupts the country because they want to be the only ones to rule over you.
[01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:23.786]  And that's the whole agenda.
[01:11:24.227 --> 01:11:31.754]  Agenda is to create a bunch of slaves that are being ruled by a small group of the elites, the globalists, whatever you want to call them.
[01:11:31.975 --> 01:11:33.216]  It's actually the new world order.
[01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:34.197]  Powerful info.
[01:11:34.237 --> 01:11:37.919]  Even having the WikiLeaks, they talk about making us poor to control us.
[01:11:37.979 --> 01:11:39.680]  I mean, they are the establishment.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.921]  The left is the elite.
[01:11:41.161 --> 01:11:42.262]  They are not woke.
[01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:45.204]  They are the establishment allied with Communist China.
[01:11:45.624 --> 01:11:48.986]  Artur Polosky, PastorStreetChurch.ca is our guest.
[01:11:49.006 --> 01:11:50.067]  You've got to go to the URL.
[01:11:50.087 --> 01:11:52.769]  They're banning him all over the place, and they're sending SWAT teams after him.
[01:11:52.789 --> 01:11:53.669]  You've got to stand with him.
[01:11:53.869 --> 01:11:54.970]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:57.031]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.732]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:11:59.773 --> 01:12:01.894]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:12:02.034 --> 01:12:02.634]  to 3 p.m.
[01:12:02.674 --> 01:12:03.054]  Central.
[01:12:03.114 --> 01:12:05.115]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:12:05.535 --> 01:12:09.336]  Thanks to you and your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:09.356 --> 01:12:12.057]  Thanks for your support to our local radio affiliates.
[01:12:12.457 --> 01:12:17.259]  We're reaching millions of people and the globalists are so upset they are admittedly in the Washington Post.
[01:12:18.339 --> 01:12:25.262]  Pushing the FBI to have me arrested for the orchestrated attack on the Capitol on January 6th, which of course I had nothing to do with.
[01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:32.786]  It wasn't overall organized other than Antifa posing as Q to manipulate some Trump supporters out of the million, maybe 500 went in or so.
[01:12:33.926 --> 01:12:36.468]  But they are on the news saying we are trying to frame Alex Jones.
[01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:37.970]  Give me the man, I'll give you the crime.
[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.931]  I'm not scared.
[01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:40.132]  I'm a good person.
[01:12:40.212 --> 01:12:40.792]  I love God.
[01:12:41.253 --> 01:12:45.436]  I mean, I'm a sinner, but I want to be good, and I've been born again, and Jesus is my Savior.
[01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:47.978]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, so I don't fear these people.
[01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:51.181]  I fear God, and I fear bowing to their evil.
[01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:51.762]  Plus, I know
[01:12:54.105 --> 01:12:56.566]  If you bow to tyrants, it's a thousand deaths.
[01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.747]  People that aren't cowards only die a single death.
[01:12:59.847 --> 01:13:03.848]  And it was Zapata that said it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
[01:13:03.928 --> 01:13:11.451]  In my experience, historically, and in life, being on your legs, standing on your feet, is safer than being on your knees.
[01:13:11.891 --> 01:13:13.512]  It's people living on their knees that I see.
[01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:15.713]  Are being enslaved.
[01:13:15.753 --> 01:13:22.698]  But since Artur Polosky, this great pastor who's been attacked and threatened and they sent the SWAT team and he still stayed open.
[01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:25.000]  I want to learn what's happening in the church now here in a moment.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.683]  Since he mentioned Justin Trudeau, his father Pierre Trudeau was a communist.
[01:13:29.723 --> 01:13:30.724]  He said he liked Mao.
[01:13:31.064 --> 01:13:33.326]  He said he liked Fidel Castro on record.
[01:13:33.726 --> 01:13:33.826]  He
[01:13:34.947 --> 01:13:35.547]  Praise them.
[01:13:35.607 --> 01:13:36.408]  He visited them.
[01:13:36.548 --> 01:13:40.489]  And so now his son says he wants to be in a basic dictatorship.
[01:13:40.509 --> 01:13:44.671]  You know, just a basic one that killed 80 plus million conservatively of their own people.
[01:13:45.691 --> 01:13:51.273]  If there was a heavyweight champion of mass murder, it's the Communist Chinese and this disgusting, evil family.
[01:13:52.133 --> 01:14:09.479]  is now giving one of the worst examples of tyranny in the world to the poor Canadians who should peacefully rise up with non-compliance and civil disobedience against their out-of-control, sniveling bureaucrats that have been trained that they are the ones meant to take over in the so-called colleges that are taxpayer-funded.
[01:14:09.959 --> 01:14:15.801]  So here is Trudeau talking about how he wants dictatorship to a group of very pleased women.
[01:14:16.715 --> 01:14:22.199]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:34.609]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:40.713]  I mean there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[01:14:40.773 --> 01:14:43.556]  That I find quite interesting.
[01:14:46.874 --> 01:14:47.694]  We're the good guys.
[01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:48.875]  We can engage in dictatorship.
[01:14:49.155 --> 01:14:52.616]  We'll shut down those pesky churches and show them who the bosses are.
[01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:54.237]  We can wear blackface, but you can't.
[01:14:55.077 --> 01:14:56.078]  We're anointed ones.
[01:14:56.678 --> 01:15:01.440]  So, Pastor Pulaski, continuing here, where is it going now?
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.662]  They came to your church this weekend, finally with some type of warrant.
[01:15:06.462 --> 01:15:07.123]  What unfolded?
[01:15:07.163 --> 01:15:07.783]  What's the next step?
[01:15:09.827 --> 01:15:17.589]  Yes, they came with a warrant to enter, with a court order to be exact, to enter the church facility.
[01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:28.371]  I had no chance to read the document because the lady kept interrupting me and I had those SWAT team officers on my left and on my right and more waiting.
[01:15:28.492 --> 01:15:29.472]  I was videotaped.
[01:15:29.532 --> 01:15:33.533]  They brought even a SWAT team that records every conversation.
[01:15:33.553 --> 01:15:34.793]  They are in the background.
[01:15:34.813 --> 01:15:35.913]  And look at this guy's eyes.
[01:15:35.933 --> 01:15:38.434]  He looks very, like he's trying to intimidate you, like he's a real tough guy.
[01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:40.512]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:50.459]  They're trained to intimidate, and they don't know what to do when a citizen actually knows the law and is not allowing them to be intimidated, you know?
[01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:51.500]  They don't know what to do.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.641]  They're not trained in the law.
[01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:58.925]  They are just law enforcement agency right now, brown shirts of Adolf Hitler.
[01:15:58.965 --> 01:16:01.647]  They're just doing what they're told by the politicians.
[01:16:01.727 --> 01:16:04.689]  And let me just add something to this whole story.
[01:16:05.069 --> 01:16:08.432]  The mayor of the city of Calgary is a Muslim homosexual.
[01:16:08.852 --> 01:16:11.894]  He absolutely hates Christians.
[01:16:11.974 --> 01:16:13.015]  He hates me.
[01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:22.321]  He has spoke publicly about me many times with a disgust and he's doing everything in his power for years actually to shut our church down.
[01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:26.023]  Now he's just... Oh of course the left is never tolerant once they get control.
[01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:27.319]  Yes.
[01:16:27.639 --> 01:16:38.788]  You know, when you think about it, now he has found the new game power that allows him to bring this fake emergency, the health emergency.
[01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:40.249]  And that's a great point.
[01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:45.513]  It gives every petty tyrant the world over the excuse to selectively enforce on who they want.
[01:16:45.774 --> 01:16:47.915]  Like you said, under communism, that's the essence of it.
[01:16:48.856 --> 01:16:50.718]  That's exactly what is happening right now.
[01:16:51.218 --> 01:16:54.340]  And, you know, down goes... What is this pig's name?
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.102]  What is this jihadi's name?
[01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:01.375]  Nahed Nenshi is a Muslim that was elected.
[01:17:01.856 --> 01:17:03.758]  Some say that he cheated the election.
[01:17:03.778 --> 01:17:05.320]  There was not enough ballots.
[01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.044]  The people could not get to the ballots.
[01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:11.628]  Some say that they disappeared in a few polling stations.
[01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.751]  So we know that the election was rigged.
[01:17:14.131 --> 01:17:15.992]  I agree, but let me guess, Pastor Pawlowski.
[01:17:42.339 --> 01:17:43.079]  It's backfiring.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:43.980]  I'm just guessing.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.621]  Is your church bigger and stronger now, under the persecution?
[01:17:46.641 --> 01:17:50.423]  Oh, it grew twice in just a few weeks.
[01:17:50.964 --> 01:18:05.531]  We're getting stronger, we're getting powerful, and I'm hoping that we'll have a thousand people, maybe more, this coming Saturday, 9.30 in the morning, just to show the government's wannabe dictators that we're not backing down, we're not bowing before their
[01:18:06.912 --> 01:18:08.473]  Tyranny, because that's what it is.
[01:18:08.613 --> 01:18:10.915]  Let me ask you, because I've been trying to follow it all, but I can't follow it all.
[01:18:11.195 --> 01:18:15.238]  With the other church, the Grace Life, what's happened with them?
[01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:16.879]  Have they kept hundreds of officers there?
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.180]  Is the fence still there?
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.502]  I mean, because if more churches do this, they can't shut them all down.
[01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:22.339]  That's right.
[01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:26.463]  And unfortunately the pastors have become cowards and the priests are not rising up.
[01:18:26.983 --> 01:18:28.285]  There's few here and there.
[01:18:28.565 --> 01:18:36.233]  What happens in the Edmonton church, the fence is still there and the officers are still there and the church went underground like in China.
[01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:37.974]  So they are meeting in a secret place.
[01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:39.716]  They're still meeting every week.
[01:18:40.317 --> 01:18:43.500]  However, it's only for the inner circle people and it's
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:44.881]  Underground.
[01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:57.613]  So can you imagine living in Canada and having to have a church service underground, just like the Chinese Christians are having right now, or under the Sharia law in different Arab countries, Islamic countries?
[01:18:57.673 --> 01:18:58.234]  Well, that's right.
[01:18:58.274 --> 01:19:05.141]  And on top of it, in places like Michigan and California and New York, some of the Christian churches and synagogues are still closed.
[01:19:05.481 --> 01:19:07.263]  But the Muslim mosques are open.
[01:19:07.303 --> 01:19:08.264]  This is real discrimination.
[01:19:09.491 --> 01:19:11.793]  Of course it is, and it's an open discrimination.
[01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:15.676]  For example, here in the Islamic Center, there were hundreds of people.
[01:19:15.696 --> 01:19:21.400]  A friend of mine, Alderman from another city, he sent me a video that his wife recorded with him.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:27.785]  Hundreds of people in a mosque, hundreds of cars outside, no police, no health inspectors, no bylaw officers.
[01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:34.810]  It looks like they can do whatever they want because the mayor protects them, but he goes heavy-handed after the Christians.
[01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:35.270]  Is
[01:19:50.267 --> 01:20:13.476]  Well, Pastor, while I'm listening to you, I've got tears in my eyes, not of sadness, not even of anger, of energy and the Holy Spirit demanding we resist this, demanding we say no, and it only fulfills revelation of the Bible that this world government's being set up, it wants to market the beast, to buy and sell, it wants to put a genetic code in our body, and it seeks immediately to shut down little churches while leaving the big, giant ones alone.
[01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:15.937]  It's just sick, it's evil, it's totally obvious.
[01:20:17.227 --> 01:20:20.329]  But you know, God, to this day, He is asking us the same question.
[01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:21.449]  Who will go for us?
[01:20:21.509 --> 01:20:24.531]  And I want to be like the prophet of all that says, Here I am, Lord.
[01:20:24.911 --> 01:20:26.472]  I may not be the most talented guy.
[01:20:26.532 --> 01:20:27.573]  Listen to my English.
[01:20:27.613 --> 01:20:32.015]  You know, I couldn't even pronounce the jail where Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:32.895]  was in.
[01:20:32.955 --> 01:20:37.358]  But I say to God, and I pray that everybody else will do the same thing.
[01:20:37.398 --> 01:20:39.299]  Just, God, here I am, Lord.
[01:20:39.319 --> 01:20:39.639]  Use me.
[01:20:39.739 --> 01:20:40.179]  Use a little
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:52.861]  And that's what they're scared of is they know God will use Christian vessels to defeat the Antichrist, and so they know preemptively try to shut that down when they roll their system out.
[01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.303]  It's all being fulfilled!
[01:20:55.438 --> 01:20:55.798]  That's right.
[01:20:56.039 --> 01:21:00.884]  And in Revelation it says that cowardly, the fearful, will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[01:21:01.164 --> 01:21:02.786]  That's why I'm calling out the lions.
[01:21:02.906 --> 01:21:06.530]  Come, let's form the biggest pie that this earth has ever seen.
[01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:08.452]  And let's chase those hyenas away.
[01:21:08.712 --> 01:21:11.035]  We lions, we eat hyenas for breakfast.
[01:21:11.095 --> 01:21:11.916]  Let's not be terrorists.
[01:21:11.936 --> 01:21:15.119]  Well, Pastor Artur Polosky, a few more minutes on the side, then I'm going to let you go.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.281]  Please come back with updates.
[01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:20.284]  I pledge, brother, that I'll be with you against the Antichrist system.
[01:21:20.344 --> 01:21:26.490]  I will never take their mark, and I will never support shutting down churches, and I will fight them tooth and nail to the end, brother.
[01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:28.051]  We'll be right back, final segment with him.
[01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:33.055]  Then Steve Quayle joins us to get into all the insanity that's going on and so much more.
[01:21:33.095 --> 01:21:33.756]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:36.078]  Ban.video.
[01:21:36.138 --> 01:21:37.239]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.242]  Well, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.063]  Our CDC masters.
[01:21:43.123 --> 01:21:47.824]  Have released the guidelines, I'll cover next hour, about where you wear a mask, where you don't.
[01:21:48.044 --> 01:21:52.266]  Outside, you don't have to, but if there's any people you need to, it's more of the same.
[01:21:53.206 --> 01:21:54.286]  Just total divide and conquer.
[01:21:54.306 --> 01:21:56.067]  It's the mask giving you bacterial pneumonia.
[01:21:56.447 --> 01:22:02.249]  It's the mask causing children to collapse and die, people to pass out from not having enough oxygen and run off the highway.
[01:22:03.349 --> 01:22:04.329]  It's simply insane.
[01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.450]  And then, oh!
[01:22:07.225 --> 01:22:12.528]  As virus rages abroad, Biden promises to ship millions of vaccine doses.
[01:22:12.548 --> 01:22:13.969]  That's the New York Times.
[01:22:14.169 --> 01:22:19.452]  AstraZeneca, banned in 21 countries in Europe, banned in the Philippines, not authorized here in the U.S.
[01:22:19.512 --> 01:22:22.694]  even though the other experimental ones are, causing all the deaths and blood clots.
[01:22:24.115 --> 01:22:30.358]  But we're going to give it to India, where they're under lockdown again, starving to death, dying of malnutrition.
[01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:33.380]  Arthur, how do you think we fight this?
[01:22:34.884 --> 01:22:38.588]  On the big picture, obviously prayer, the big agenda, we expose it.
[01:22:39.449 --> 01:22:41.892]  In the time we have left here, a few minutes, what else would you like to add?
[01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:42.533]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:47.732]  Well, history is teaching us what is next.
[01:22:47.892 --> 01:22:53.875]  That's why they have not been teaching our children history because they don't want the people to know the truth.
[01:22:54.395 --> 01:22:59.838]  Masks, historically speaking, were always a symbol of submission, symbol of slavery.
[01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:03.981]  What they're telling you, wear a mask because you have no identity.
[01:23:04.061 --> 01:23:08.963]  We are removing who you are and we are removing your rights to express yourself.
[01:23:09.003 --> 01:23:09.744]  You're muzzled.
[01:23:11.325 --> 01:23:11.985]  You're a slave.
[01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:14.518]  And you have no say.
[01:23:14.538 --> 01:23:15.741]  You have no identity.
[01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:16.783]  We don't care who you are.
[01:23:16.823 --> 01:23:19.528]  You're just a social insurance number and you have no say.
[01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.292]  Take the mask off.
[01:23:21.753 --> 01:23:22.815]  Stop complying.
[01:23:23.296 --> 01:23:23.917]  Resist.
[01:23:24.784 --> 01:23:25.885]  Go to the rallies.
[01:23:26.425 --> 01:23:26.665]  Go.
[01:23:26.945 --> 01:23:33.769]  I always said to the people what I observed in 1981, I saw the power of unified Poles taking it to the streets.
[01:23:33.929 --> 01:23:35.369]  Tens of thousands were arrested.
[01:23:35.489 --> 01:23:35.730]  True.
[01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.531]  Some were shot dead.
[01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:38.731]  Some were clubbed to death.
[01:23:39.051 --> 01:23:44.094]  And by the way, for those who don't know, didn't the fall of the Soviet Union really begin in Poland and that was the example to Eastern Germany?
[01:23:45.245 --> 01:23:50.647]  Of course, Solidarity Movement with Lech Wałęsa, they took it to the streets, and they didn't care.
[01:23:50.687 --> 01:23:54.369]  They said, shoot us dead, shoot us all dead, but we want our rights back.
[01:23:54.409 --> 01:23:56.390]  We want our freedom right, if not for our sake today.
[01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.510]  What was the tipping point?
[01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:04.554]  Because, I mean, the Poles went through hell in World War II, then after with Stalin, and then, of course, the Ukrainian Khrushchev.
[01:24:04.574 --> 01:24:09.136]  I mean, you guys went through a lot, and were robbed continually, just like the Ukrainians and others.
[01:24:09.716 --> 01:24:12.077]  What was the tipping point of all those nightmares to finally say no?
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.681]  Well, people had absolutely no rights.
[01:24:15.721 --> 01:24:16.902]  There was nothing in the stores.
[01:24:16.962 --> 01:24:19.424]  There was total destruction, a collapse of economy.
[01:24:20.004 --> 01:24:20.444]  Nothing.
[01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:21.325]  Propaganda.
[01:24:21.365 --> 01:24:23.886]  The only thing you were listening is lie after lie after lie.
[01:24:24.267 --> 01:24:26.868]  Finally, people in 81 said, enough, it's enough.
[01:24:26.888 --> 01:24:31.131]  We get a fight for our future generation, for our children, for our grandchildren.
[01:24:31.251 --> 01:24:32.492]  And they took it to the streets.
[01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:35.234]  When they took it to the streets, it was over.
[01:24:35.254 --> 01:24:35.794]  It was the beginning.
[01:24:35.874 --> 01:24:36.755]  Yes, of course.
[01:24:52.997 --> 01:24:54.058]  After the second war.
[01:24:54.178 --> 01:24:56.380]  So it's possible, but we have to unite.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.304]  It was called Solidarity Movement because people were in solidarity together.
[01:25:01.644 --> 01:25:10.230]  They forgot about all the differences, and I'm sure they had many, and they united under one banner, freedom, and they won their country back.
[01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:13.172]  I mean, in the end of the day, Alex, it's your country.
[01:25:13.272 --> 01:25:14.073]  It's my country.
[01:25:14.093 --> 01:25:15.474]  It's not just their country.
[01:25:15.874 --> 01:25:17.095]  We are in this together.
[01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:21.999]  We, the patriots, we, the lovers of our countries, we are the lovers of the freedoms.
[01:25:27.012 --> 01:25:33.974]  Indeed, we have to have the right to tell the people that our God sits on the throne and he will have the final say.
[01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.375]  Alex, we know how the story ends.
[01:25:36.635 --> 01:25:40.016]  We know that it's tough, like you see right now with those lions and hyenas.
[01:25:40.257 --> 01:25:44.758]  But we know that our lion from the tribe of Judah is going to come to clean the swamp.
[01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:56.142]  And I'm telling you, I would be afraid if I was the hyena of today, because he is not going to show any mercy to those that are doing this great evil to so many people today.
[01:25:57.145 --> 01:25:59.206]  All right, Pastor, give us updates as it unfolds.
[01:25:59.246 --> 01:26:00.487]  We really are rooting for you.
[01:26:00.507 --> 01:26:01.388]  We're all in this together.
[01:26:01.408 --> 01:26:02.308]  Arthur Polosky.
[01:26:02.688 --> 01:26:04.730]  The website is streetchurch.ca.
[01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:15.076]  And I mean, if they dare put up a fence around your church, I know you're going to do the right thing and go, everybody just show up via email, show up inside Walmart where you're allowed to meet and have your church right there.
[01:26:15.676 --> 01:26:16.897]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:18.298]  God bless you.
[01:26:19.599 --> 01:26:22.761]  Well, that is like a cool drink of water in the middle of the desert, isn't it?
[01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:24.762]  Resistance is victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:32.174]  Now, I started the show with this, and it makes me become violently angry.
[01:26:32.514 --> 01:26:35.856]  And I'm not going to go out and be violent, but I'm not a virtuous signaler, okay?
[01:26:36.757 --> 01:26:43.321]  I see Indians living in squalor and corruption, and I don't think, well, let's just exterminate those people.
[01:26:43.361 --> 01:26:44.282]  I think those are human beings.
[01:26:45.142 --> 01:26:46.563]  And that's my instincts.
[01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:47.224]  That's my spirit.
[01:26:47.324 --> 01:26:48.745]  But I know why I'm designed like that.
[01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:53.588]  I have a real feeling of pain for them when the left just wants to exploit them and kill them.
[01:26:54.912 --> 01:27:00.975]  Because they're human beings made in the image of God, and if I write them off, I will be written off by God.
[01:27:01.976 --> 01:27:03.196]  But that's the spiritual level.
[01:27:04.117 --> 01:27:11.420]  Physically, here on this planet, if you let that happen to them, you're next.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:22.766]  You understand that I read you mainstream articles admitting that two million extra Indians, this is like a three-month-old article, in the year of lockdown, have starved to death from malnutrition on top of the millions that already starved.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:27.842]  That's out of the, it's gotta be 15 million now extra died in the last year under the lockdown.
[01:27:27.862 --> 01:27:29.202]  The old UN number was about 10 million.
[01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:33.224]  So instead of 15 million starving to death, 25 million plus.
[01:27:34.885 --> 01:27:39.047]  That's more people that have died even with fake COVID numbers worldwide just in India.
[01:27:39.927 --> 01:27:42.248]  Those are dead people starving to death.
[01:27:44.249 --> 01:27:51.493]  And they just lay over in their little shack, and the first cold virus or flu virus comes by and they die, and then the media calls it COVID-19.
[01:27:53.482 --> 01:28:03.504]  And so, when I see the trendies with their mask, and I see them with their hatred and their pedophilia, I mean, because they've converted a lot of the low-level left into evil now.
[01:28:03.524 --> 01:28:06.405]  I mean, there used to be kind of high-level was super evil, then kind of mid-level.
[01:28:06.805 --> 01:28:12.426]  Now the average leftist is, for all intents and purposes, a devil-worshipping ghoul.
[01:28:13.046 --> 01:28:15.707]  I don't know what's happened to them, but they're gone, folks.
[01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:28.586]  They're programmed by big tech, they're programmed by media, and they're a small minority of people, but they infest all the main cities, they command Black Lives Matter, and they command the Antifa, and they're just gone.
[01:28:31.505 --> 01:28:36.069]  This is the wages of following this world system, is becoming one of these creatures.
[01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:41.513]  Because I know normal people that suddenly don't look normal and become all whacked out and basically possessed.
[01:28:41.553 --> 01:28:44.796]  And they're on weird drugs, they're on illegal drugs, they're on pharmakia.
[01:28:45.076 --> 01:28:50.400]  It's 30% of the public's now on some type of psychotropic or prescription drug that alters their brain.
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.601]  We are poisoned!
[01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:53.182]  We are mesmerized!
[01:28:53.242 --> 01:28:54.383]  We are in a trance!
[01:28:54.803 --> 01:28:57.846]  And we need to break out of the trance together!
[01:28:59.246 --> 01:29:03.287]  And then I see all over the news, oh, Biden's sending help vaccines!
[01:29:03.487 --> 01:29:09.049]  Oh, America is going to send tens of millions of doses of vaccine to save the Indians!
[01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.869]  Aren't we good?
[01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:16.611]  This is after they threw out Bill Gates and the Pfizer vaccine because it killed so many people it doesn't protect you.
[01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:18.892]  And it's the AstraZeneca ban all over the world.
[01:29:19.612 --> 01:29:21.853]  And it's just so sick.
[01:29:26.124 --> 01:29:26.865]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:29:27.005 --> 01:29:30.307]  India, at least 11 dead and 1,000 taken ill after gas leak.
[01:29:31.788 --> 01:29:36.371]  And then they show you the exact same photos and say, COVID surge swallowing people in India.
[01:29:36.732 --> 01:29:39.614]  Footage shows people dead in the streets.
[01:29:39.714 --> 01:29:41.515]  Yeah, that's just one more of the things I've got.
[01:29:42.856 --> 01:29:45.738]  I haven't gotten through one stat today of all I've got here.
[01:29:47.779 --> 01:29:49.120]  I mean, it's that much news.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.261]  Who's hosting the fourth hour?
[01:29:50.281 --> 01:29:51.102]  I may have to take it over.
[01:29:53.797 --> 01:29:55.238]  Oh, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:55.318 --> 01:29:56.038]  I'll let him host.
[01:29:56.218 --> 01:29:56.718]  He's a great guy.
[01:29:57.378 --> 01:30:01.000]  But I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is genocide going on in front of everybody.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.321]  By the way, if we don't fund ourselves, we won't be here.
[01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:04.601]  So it's a win-win-win.
[01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:06.062]  Please support us at InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:30:06.082 --> 01:30:08.442]  We've got a lot of new great t-shirts.
[01:30:09.163 --> 01:30:10.643]  With the media is the virus.
[01:30:10.703 --> 01:30:11.804]  COVID-19's a hoax.
[01:30:12.504 --> 01:30:14.445]  F. Fauci, F. Gates, F. Biden.
[01:30:15.405 --> 01:30:16.205]  Are really popular.
[01:30:16.906 --> 01:30:19.666]  We've also got Vitamin Mineral Fusion that's selling out very quickly.
[01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:21.487]  Winter Sun, great for your immune system.
[01:30:21.547 --> 01:30:24.568]  All their bodies sold out for five, six months.
[01:30:25.428 --> 01:30:33.571]  It's super concentrated turmeric for your immune system, for joint support, for flexibility support, for anti-inflammation support.
[01:30:34.031 --> 01:30:36.752]  This is the strongest you're going to find out there.
[01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:37.532]  People love it.
[01:30:37.612 --> 01:30:38.833]  And we can fund our operation.
[01:30:38.973 --> 01:30:40.013]  We can just keep this in stock.
[01:30:40.673 --> 01:30:42.214]  But because of the breakdown of supply chains,
[01:30:43.677 --> 01:30:46.580]  We've got a limited supply, and my crews are like, well, why are you offering 50% off?
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.781]  Well, I just want people to get it.
[01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:52.485]  We'll go back to regular price here in about a week, because it's going to sell out in two weeks of current sales rates.
[01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:53.766]  And we just had enough of it.
[01:30:53.786 --> 01:30:54.707]  We can just fund ourselves.
[01:30:54.747 --> 01:30:56.548]  But right now, we've got somewhat of a deficit.
[01:30:56.588 --> 01:30:57.489]  The InfoWar is war chest.
[01:30:57.509 --> 01:30:58.530]  So get products you need.
[01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:00.952]  Fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[01:31:01.332 --> 01:31:03.494]  Also, Prostagard, not just for men, great for women.
[01:31:03.774 --> 01:31:07.117]  The great vitamins, the great minerals, and the salt palmetto, great for all your glands.
[01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:13.818]  Vazzo Beats, concentrated beet extract to create the nitrogen oxide and more in your bloodstream.
[01:31:13.838 --> 01:31:14.619]  That's the key to it.
[01:31:14.639 --> 01:31:16.279]  That's why beets are such a great thing.
[01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:17.600]  And raw beets are great, too.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.861]  This is just the equivalent of eating a whole bushel of them.
[01:31:20.001 --> 01:31:25.243]  Also, Alpha Power, ladies and gentlemen, is basically the dry form of Supermelt Vitality, but even stronger.
[01:31:25.683 --> 01:31:28.044]  But the Supermelt Vitality is cold pressed, so it's apples and oranges.
[01:31:28.464 --> 01:31:29.425]  One's like a fine wine.
[01:31:29.485 --> 01:31:31.946]  One's like a Jack Daniels, if you use that analogy.
[01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.966]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:33.986 --> 01:31:34.027]  888-253-3139.
[01:31:37.808 --> 01:31:40.889]  I coined the term 360Win because the globalists teach us that there's winners and there's losers.
[01:31:40.909 --> 01:31:42.149]  That's not how the universe really works.
[01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:43.169]  We have unlimited resources.
[01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:44.249]  We're made in the image of God.
[01:31:44.269 --> 01:31:45.630]  We can do incredible things.
[01:32:06.442 --> 01:32:20.467]  But that said, when I say 360 WIN, in this connotation it means, it's a great product, very low price, one of the best deals you'll find, period, out there, and it funds the Info War, which gets the truth out, so that's the 360 WIN.
[01:32:23.519 --> 01:32:39.508]  So, you can do straight up donations at InfoWarsTore.com and that's great, or just go to PrepareWithAlex.com or InfoWarsTore.com and get 10% off right now for a limited time on the entire catalog of My Patriot Supplies, high quality, extremely well packaged foods that last many, many years.

[01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:57.936]  All right, folks, we got Steve Quayle coming up, and I want to air two Tucker clips back-to-back, because what he's doing is truly revolutionary.
[01:32:57.976 --> 01:33:06.862]  He exposes it's time to push back on the mask hoax, the abuse of children, and to say no to the left that wants to bully us into submission and taking untested vaccines.
[01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:12.006]  And then he gets into the fact that Biden is making no decisions and is a total and complete puppet.
[01:33:12.206 --> 01:33:19.691]  And then Steve Quayle's coming up next segment, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:33:20.991 --> 01:33:23.792]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[01:33:24.172 --> 01:33:26.573]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[01:33:27.353 --> 01:33:28.574]  Masks are for the guilty.
[01:33:28.914 --> 01:33:30.915]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[01:33:31.595 --> 01:33:34.996]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[01:33:35.256 --> 01:33:37.537]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[01:33:37.957 --> 01:33:39.077]  The rest of us showed our face.
[01:33:39.097 --> 01:33:40.018]  We were free people.
[01:33:41.038 --> 01:33:49.341]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[01:33:50.549 --> 01:33:54.550]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[01:33:55.171 --> 01:34:00.252]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[01:34:00.872 --> 01:34:02.233]  We wear them because we have to.
[01:34:02.793 --> 01:34:06.754]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[01:34:07.255 --> 01:34:08.075]  How neurotic are they?
[01:34:08.795 --> 01:34:09.255]  Well, we know.
[01:34:09.916 --> 01:34:20.085]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[01:34:20.845 --> 01:34:23.688]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[01:34:24.368 --> 01:34:28.892]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask,
[01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:32.254]  Angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[01:34:32.294 --> 01:34:33.115]  How could you?
[01:34:33.315 --> 01:34:34.635]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[01:34:35.316 --> 01:34:36.036]  How could you?
[01:34:36.496 --> 01:34:39.278]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[01:34:39.878 --> 01:34:41.919]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[01:34:42.039 --> 01:34:42.960]  They're the aggressors.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.962]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[01:34:47.842 --> 01:34:51.764]  So the next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[01:34:52.364 --> 01:34:53.625]  Ask politely but firmly.
[01:34:53.845 --> 01:34:55.365]  Would you please take off your mask?
[01:34:55.986 --> 01:34:58.347]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[01:34:58.667 --> 01:35:00.928]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[01:35:02.148 --> 01:35:09.271]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble on an elevator.
[01:35:09.932 --> 01:35:10.872]  It's repulsive.
[01:35:10.972 --> 01:35:12.273]  Don't do it around other people.
[01:35:12.913 --> 01:35:14.574]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[01:35:15.774 --> 01:35:18.616]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:25.961]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid at Walmart.
[01:35:26.381 --> 01:35:27.702]  Call the police immediately.
[01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.603]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[01:35:29.984 --> 01:35:31.385]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[01:35:32.165 --> 01:35:37.488]  What you're looking at is abuse, it's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[01:35:38.188 --> 01:35:45.631]  If it's your own children being abused, then- I have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president, who you just heard from, Kamala Harris.
[01:35:47.652 --> 01:35:52.114]  Kamala, Doug, like it or not, you're family.
[01:35:52.735 --> 01:35:54.836]  You become an honorary Biden, there's no way out.
[01:35:57.233 --> 01:36:03.816]  So that was Joe Biden referring to somebody called Doug Emhoff, whom he described as the husband of Kamala Harris.
[01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:05.597]  And we took that all at face value because we're naive.
[01:36:06.098 --> 01:36:08.199]  But we have some breaking reporting to bring you tonight.
[01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:11.561]  It comes courtesy of a blog from Northern Virginia called Politico.
[01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:15.683]  Six reporters from Politico worked on this story.
[01:36:15.723 --> 01:36:21.026]  The piece has this headline, Doug Emhoff rebrands as Second Gentleman Douglas.
[01:36:22.046 --> 01:36:29.554]  According to Politico, Doug Emhoff is now going by Douglas, and as you'd expect, the White House is trying to downplay this bombshell change.
[01:36:30.435 --> 01:36:36.221]  A spokesperson for Emhoff told Politico that the story was, quote, bizarre, and that, quote, his name is Douglas Emhoff.
[01:36:36.941 --> 01:36:41.686]  Safe to say, like most people, his full and abbreviated names have always been used interchangeably.
[01:36:42.627 --> 01:36:43.829]  What does that mean, exactly?
[01:36:45.458 --> 01:36:47.459]  One editorial note, by the way, before we continue.
[01:36:47.539 --> 01:36:56.585]  This show, in the interest of accuracy, will cease referring to the White House or anything associated with it, the entire executive branch of government, as the, quote, Biden administration.
[01:36:56.605 --> 01:37:00.727]  And the reason we're changing is not to make a statement, but merely to reflect reality.
[01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:06.510]  Joe Biden, whatever his merits as a human being, has no active role in running the U.S.
[01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:06.891]  government.
[01:37:07.051 --> 01:37:07.811]  Everyone knows that.
[01:37:07.891 --> 01:37:09.132]  Everyone pretends otherwise.
[01:37:09.632 --> 01:37:10.153]  But it's true.
[01:37:11.161 --> 01:37:23.129]  And so henceforth we will refer to it as the administration, the White House, the Kamala Harris administration, the regime, the third and former radical Obama administration, this group of people that Susan Rice seems to be in control of, or whatever, something precise.
[01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:24.350]  That's right, it's the third Obama administration.
[01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:27.192]  I don't want to refer to it as the Biden administration because it's not.
[01:37:27.212 --> 01:37:29.313]  It was O'Biden, now it's O'Harris.
[01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.194]  Hey, Chairman Hannity here.
[01:37:30.314 --> 01:37:32.455]  Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News.
[01:37:32.475 --> 01:37:33.216]  Yes, Hannity, we will.
[01:37:33.416 --> 01:37:39.199]  All right, we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to come back with Steve Quayle on the other side.
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.322]  We are now into our number three.
[01:37:42.502 --> 01:37:57.535]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and the great Steve Quayle, best-selling author, filmmaker, one of the first big survivalists, one of the top survivalists out there, and I would read his books 25 years ago, 20 years ago, and say quite entertaining, and I knew a lot of it was true, but I thought some of the
[01:37:59.994 --> 01:38:00.054]  So
[01:38:18.473 --> 01:38:22.155]  They're taking DMT in laboratories and connecting to other dimensions.
[01:38:22.295 --> 01:38:23.415]  You might call them spirits.
[01:38:23.836 --> 01:38:25.116]  This is all mainstream news.
[01:38:25.396 --> 01:38:27.097]  They're like, yes, we want to have sex with children.
[01:38:27.117 --> 01:38:28.598]  Yes, animal and human clones are real.
[01:38:28.838 --> 01:38:30.159]  Yes, we want the blood of children.
[01:38:30.199 --> 01:38:31.319]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:38:31.359 --> 01:38:33.100]  And everybody's like, Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is right.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.181]  Well, Steve Quayle.
[01:38:34.941 --> 01:38:38.243]  Was right when it came to that hardcore stuff before even I was.
[01:38:39.003 --> 01:38:39.864]  And so he's here with us.
[01:38:39.904 --> 01:38:43.266]  I want to cover the waterfront, the limited time we had with him.
[01:38:44.326 --> 01:38:47.388]  And he wants to get into the vaccine shedding that medical doctors warned of.
[01:38:47.468 --> 01:38:47.988]  It's now happening.
[01:38:48.348 --> 01:38:52.871]  Even NPR had scientists on six months ago saying we're worried about MNR vaccines.
[01:38:53.231 --> 01:38:56.032]  They're not vaccines that will cause real viruses to come out of the cells.
[01:38:56.413 --> 01:38:57.593]  Well, now that's happening.
[01:38:57.653 --> 01:39:00.015]  So this is a very diabolical plan.
[01:39:00.035 --> 01:39:01.876]  But look at some of these articles of your TV viewer.
[01:39:02.956 --> 01:39:04.277]  This is this is confirmed.
[01:39:05.902 --> 01:39:08.564]  Sky TV ran the news a year ago.
[01:39:08.584 --> 01:39:14.029]  At least 11 dead and 1,000 taken ill after gas leak in India.
[01:39:14.089 --> 01:39:15.991]  And then now here's the same photo, the same woman.
[01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:17.931]  We're good to go.
[01:39:37.191 --> 01:39:39.072]  They say 60% might take it later.
[01:39:39.112 --> 01:39:39.932]  So that's how you hear the number.
[01:39:40.973 --> 01:39:42.674]  60% have taken it or are thinking about it.
[01:39:42.934 --> 01:39:45.155]  No, they've hit a brick wall in India.
[01:39:45.175 --> 01:39:48.677]  The head spokesperson, that's a movie star there, said take the vaccine.
[01:39:48.697 --> 01:39:49.957]  He died a day later of a heart attack.
[01:39:50.358 --> 01:39:51.198]  That's in the literature.
[01:39:51.538 --> 01:39:53.719]  So the wheels are coming off of this.
[01:39:53.839 --> 01:39:54.240]  Meanwhile,
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:03.207]  Biden has announced he's going to dump the experimental AstraZeneca, banned in 21 European countries, banned in the Philippines, banned in a bunch of other places, on them.
[01:40:03.307 --> 01:40:05.369]  Not even approved experimentally here in the U.S.
[01:40:05.689 --> 01:40:07.010]  He's going to dump that on them.
[01:40:07.271 --> 01:40:08.912]  The media calls it a wonderful thing.
[01:40:09.633 --> 01:40:11.955]  So this is a giant experiment in evil.
[01:40:12.255 --> 01:40:13.916]  But isn't our dictator nice?
[01:40:13.937 --> 01:40:14.217]  He says,
[01:40:14.637 --> 01:40:17.619]  We can not wear our mask if we're by ourselves outside now.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:20.422]  Isn't he nice to tell us that we don't have to wear his little burka?
[01:40:20.442 --> 01:40:24.565]  So, Steve Quayle, we really appreciate you joining us from SteveQuayle.com.
[01:40:25.065 --> 01:40:25.906]  So much to talk about.
[01:40:25.926 --> 01:40:30.329]  We also sell a bunch of your incredible Big Coffee Table lavish books.
[01:40:30.349 --> 01:40:33.191]  They're not just amazing reads with great photos and graphics.
[01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:35.893]  They're just beautiful books at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:40:37.254 --> 01:40:41.598]  You're always telling us tomorrow's news today, and you were right about everything that's now happened.
[01:40:41.638 --> 01:40:43.139]  Tell us what's coming next, my friend.
[01:40:44.383 --> 01:40:55.746]  Well, I think Alex, the global extinction plan that you and I and others have written about, detailed, podcasting, broadcasting 25 years is now in full force and full effect.
[01:40:56.206 --> 01:41:10.830]  And you know, when we talk about the word extinction, just a few of those articles you put up there, isn't it interesting that the side effects of the mutagenic injection, I won't call it the V word, okay, is now spreading to even 80 and 90 year old women
[01:41:11.277 --> 01:41:17.180]  Who have stopped menses, probably 40 years before, now having their menstrual cycles.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:20.342]  Pregnant women basically miscarrying their babies.
[01:41:20.362 --> 01:41:21.842]  By the way, you talked about that a month ago.
[01:41:21.862 --> 01:41:23.323]  It was in the Chicago Tribune last week.
[01:41:23.383 --> 01:41:24.224]  This is happening.
[01:41:25.344 --> 01:41:25.684]  It is.
[01:41:26.105 --> 01:41:28.066]  And ladies and gentlemen, one thing is interesting.
[01:41:28.126 --> 01:41:32.508]  Alex, you and I spoke about the Deagle Report when it first came out probably 10 years ago.
[01:41:33.115 --> 01:41:45.220]  And after the vaccine was released, somebody ordered the sanitation of the Diegel Report, not to show the 250 million people, Americans, that would be dead by the year 2025.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:58.866]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is, is that everything you're seeing concerning this mutagenic, in other words, genetic mutating injection, is designed to kill humanity.
[01:41:59.166 --> 01:42:01.887]  They're not just happy with right now,
[01:42:02.267 --> 01:42:07.132]  Oh, by the way, now they admit, don't take the shot of your breastfeeding, so they admit it's killing babies.
[01:42:07.172 --> 01:42:08.413]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:42:28.581 --> 01:42:32.527]  They only cover their ass while they're trying to chew ours off, okay?
[01:42:32.547 --> 01:42:33.588]  And I mean in a permanent way.
[01:42:33.608 --> 01:42:34.930]  Yeah, explain how that works.
[01:42:35.111 --> 01:42:35.992]  It's the fine print.
[01:42:36.032 --> 01:42:39.117]  They're warning you what they're doing so they metaphysically have a way out.
[01:42:40.185 --> 01:42:54.970]  Yeah, and also, remember, they always want plausible deniability, but I also think it's the mocking of humanity when the devil tells you he's going to do this, he's going to do it this way, he does it that way, and everybody scratches their head and goes, gee, there's nothing sinister about this.
[01:42:55.390 --> 01:43:08.094]  I think that the whole issue right now that's on the forefront of the world stage is we now have before us genetically articulated and targeted bioweapons
[01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:10.451]  No, you said it here.
[01:43:10.491 --> 01:43:12.691]  You're talking about race-specific by 11.
[01:43:31.837 --> 01:43:35.020]  Yes, and so thanks for telling me so many things.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:40.026]  The thing is is that, ladies and gentlemen, this technology that you can look at Project Coast.
[01:43:40.426 --> 01:43:45.011]  I've been on with Alex all these years, even when we talked about Ebola and watched a miracle.
[01:43:45.071 --> 01:43:48.735]  That was a miracle when everybody was flipping out that Ebola was coming to the United States.
[01:43:49.135 --> 01:43:54.521]  They recycled this stuff, and I think people have got to get a hold of their fear and say,
[01:43:55.021 --> 01:44:01.585]  There is no scientific basis for me to take an experimental mutagenic injection.
[01:44:01.885 --> 01:44:03.746]  The word V isn't interesting.
[01:44:03.786 --> 01:44:13.412]  We had the V movement of women wearing things on their head, but now we've got the I moment of injections, and this is what's really important.
[01:44:13.872 --> 01:44:15.974]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is all about one thing.
[01:44:16.294 --> 01:44:23.821]  It's about the depopulation of the world from 7.9 billion to 500 million, and that's where we're at right now.
[01:44:24.622 --> 01:44:35.631]  And I don't care, you know, in America, one lying scientist backed up by two more lying scientists and backed up by an organization that's wrong, wrong, wrong.
[01:44:36.032 --> 01:44:37.553]  How can anybody believe these?
[01:44:37.593 --> 01:44:40.616]  The mask of death, the mask of the beast, the mark of the beast,
[01:44:41.056 --> 01:44:42.257]  And the murder by the beast.
[01:44:42.337 --> 01:44:52.182]  And now we're seeing anybody who dares question the MSM propaganda organ being considered persona non grata terrorists.
[01:44:52.282 --> 01:44:55.344]  And we're seeing the DHS purging any conservatives.
[01:44:55.384 --> 01:44:56.505]  We're seeing the U.S.
[01:44:56.585 --> 01:44:57.025]  military.
[01:44:57.045 --> 01:44:57.665]  It's interesting.
[01:44:58.025 --> 01:45:00.427]  Russia's preparing for war like no other time.
[01:45:00.847 --> 01:45:09.652]  And yet the bottom line is our military's hierarchy is more concerned with political correctness than battlefield tactics and preparedness.
[01:45:10.112 --> 01:45:15.517]  And Alex, we're watching right now the absolute embracing
[01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:17.131]  Of insanity.
[01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:23.675]  The commercial where you see all these people running into a hole, I forget which company that was for, that's where they're going.
[01:45:23.935 --> 01:45:27.037]  The lendings are on hyperdrive, overdrive.
[01:45:27.437 --> 01:45:37.563]  And now I want people to understand, when you hear the word carbon footprint, I want you to understand this, that is Luciferian talk for destroying humanity.
[01:45:37.944 --> 01:45:40.005]  You are the carbon footprint.
[01:45:40.325 --> 01:45:49.009]  And in your place, having written about singularity, having written about transhumanism two and a half decades ago, the bottom line is here.
[01:45:49.089 --> 01:45:59.513]  So when you hear these euphemistic and these flowery statements that we've got to lower the carbon footprint, it's just like Mike Adams says, these guys want to destroy photosynthesis.
[01:45:59.993 --> 01:46:01.273]  And let me back you up again.
[01:46:01.794 --> 01:46:02.214]  Exactly.
[01:46:02.274 --> 01:46:09.636]  Bill Gates famously said at the TED Talk, we've got to reduce this number to zero, and laser-pointed the human population, and they all laugh because they're in on it.
[01:46:09.836 --> 01:46:12.356]  This is a sick, post-human Satan cult.
[01:46:13.477 --> 01:46:13.777]  It is.
[01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:16.898]  And that is who is orchestrating it.
[01:46:17.438 --> 01:46:20.298]  The kings of the earth, biblically, give their power.
[01:46:20.518 --> 01:46:21.439]  That means their authority.
[01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:22.539]  That means their finances.
[01:46:23.012 --> 01:46:23.813]  On to the beast.
[01:46:24.233 --> 01:46:26.294]  And the beast is starting to manifest.
[01:46:26.574 --> 01:46:35.019]  Look, we're hearing all of the newest levels of spyware and trackware maintain humanity under 500 million perpetual balance with nature.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:43.104]  By the way, they always try and assume that imaginary people put the money behind that.
[01:46:43.164 --> 01:46:51.870]  I can tell you this, you can probably guess the two leading eugenicists in the world and those are the guys that put the money up to it, though they use cut-offs and everything.
[01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:54.793]  So here's the thing that people have got to understand.
[01:46:55.333 --> 01:47:03.140]  You have now in your face contempt for the human race, and we need carbon removal.
[01:47:03.661 --> 01:47:05.302]  Well, what is he made of?
[01:47:05.462 --> 01:47:07.624]  Well, I know what he's made of, but I'll say this.
[01:47:07.965 --> 01:47:09.466]  Is he a synthetic life form?
[01:47:09.526 --> 01:47:10.307]  And the word synth,
[01:47:10.823 --> 01:47:11.805]  S-Y-N-T-H.
[01:47:12.285 --> 01:47:14.248]  That's what people are trading.
[01:47:14.268 --> 01:47:17.853]  A lot of these guys, they, by the way, they pledge their allegiance.
[01:47:18.214 --> 01:47:20.276]  They pledge everything to Lord Lucifer.
[01:47:20.356 --> 01:47:20.657]  They do.
[01:47:20.677 --> 01:47:22.540]  We'll talk about that and who they are when we come back.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.040]  Stay with us.
[01:47:24.362 --> 01:47:27.306]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:28.194 --> 01:47:31.115]  All right, you talk about being simpatico here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.996 --> 01:47:32.796]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:47:33.496 --> 01:47:43.781]  I was about to come back and ask him about the robot element takeover, replacing us, making us obsolete, getting rid of the military, making it all robots, that way globalists control everything.
[01:47:44.261 --> 01:47:44.882]  Well, here it is.
[01:47:45.322 --> 01:47:46.282]  Big changes to U.S.
[01:47:46.322 --> 01:47:46.722]  Marines.
[01:47:46.783 --> 01:47:48.783]  No tanks, fewer people, and many more drones.
[01:47:49.244 --> 01:47:51.565]  They went by 2030, almost no humans involved.
[01:47:52.325 --> 01:47:56.287]  Air Force Base deploys pack of robot dogs to enhance security.
[01:47:57.751 --> 01:48:02.672]  Farming robot kills 100,000 weeds per hour with lasers.
[01:48:02.692 --> 01:48:06.113]  AI-powered HR bot solution for employee engagement.
[01:48:06.413 --> 01:48:07.913]  McDonald's is moving to no humans.
[01:48:08.294 --> 01:48:11.894]  Amazon's automated checkout is coming to full-size supermarkets.
[01:48:12.955 --> 01:48:16.556]  NATO tees up negotiations on artificial intelligence in weapons.
[01:48:17.776 --> 01:48:20.537]  It is the takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:23.077]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[01:48:23.857 --> 01:48:26.338]  That's where you wanted to go, and that was actually the stack I had.
[01:48:29.991 --> 01:48:33.053]  Alex, here's something that everyone needs to put into perspective.
[01:48:33.814 --> 01:48:38.017]  The replacement of humans is in the headlines.
[01:48:38.097 --> 01:48:43.620]  Every single one of those stories that you've just shown with your overhead camera is what's in play.
[01:48:44.001 --> 01:48:52.106]  But when you get into the military, you get into the 1992 movie that was the sci-fi world's telling us about universal soldiers, super soldiers.
[01:48:52.567 --> 01:48:55.829]  And one of the problems right now is when China announced
[01:48:56.423 --> 01:49:09.648]  The combining of a chimpanzee and a human embryo, the bottom line is that was done by Stalin, or at least attempted, almost 70 years ago.
[01:49:10.108 --> 01:49:18.671]  But the advancement in genetic killing machines, today's technology, tomorrow's monsters, genetic Armageddon is here.
[01:49:19.271 --> 01:49:21.574]  And now that's not just a troop.
[01:49:21.954 --> 01:49:26.519]  The Terminator troops in China, they have no Western moral constraints.
[01:49:26.579 --> 01:49:33.426]  I've talked to guys, I'm sure you have too, that literally suffer from PTSD and these are some of the toughest men in the world.
[01:49:33.926 --> 01:49:38.609]  X-Delta, X-Seals, X-Ultra Black, meaning people don't even know they exist.
[01:49:39.089 --> 01:49:44.192]  But they've seen things that absolutely no- Oh, I've told the stories and people make jokes.
[01:49:44.372 --> 01:49:50.236]  I've talked to people and some of you that have seen human fish, human rats with human heads.
[01:49:50.256 --> 01:49:56.599]  I mean, this has been going on for at least 50 years and people think we're just saying that now it's out in the open.
[01:49:56.639 --> 01:50:01.142]  Mainstream news showed monkey humans that have like monkey heads and human bodies last week.
[01:50:02.623 --> 01:50:03.143]  Absolutely.
[01:50:03.203 --> 01:50:05.264]  And see here, ladies and gentlemen, this is critical.
[01:50:06.265 --> 01:50:08.546]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:50:09.006 --> 01:50:20.532]  But contrary to just the effects of denialism and mostly Americans, we've lost our freedoms because so many people were looking and saying, well, it's not going to happen in my lifetime.
[01:50:20.592 --> 01:50:23.894]  It's not going to happen in my children's lifetime.
[01:50:23.954 --> 01:50:25.355]  No, it's happening right now.
[01:50:25.755 --> 01:50:26.715]  And it's beyond this.
[01:50:26.835 --> 01:50:31.638]  Alex, I interviewed one of the Intel World's most famous assassins.
[01:50:31.698 --> 01:50:32.138]  He died
[01:50:33.032 --> 01:50:33.792]  Fifteen years ago.
[01:50:34.172 --> 01:50:45.954]  And he said, Steve, I've been in a laboratory, some of the most secret places in the deep underwater, in the jungles, in Borneo, the island of Dr. Moreau.
[01:50:45.994 --> 01:50:50.755]  He said, I've seen I've seen things in cages, half human, half lion.
[01:50:51.195 --> 01:50:54.676]  By the way, the lion men of Moab is literally in the Old Testament.
[01:50:55.036 --> 01:50:58.136]  But he said these creatures were calling out to me in a human voice.
[01:50:58.516 --> 01:50:59.036]  Help me.
[01:50:59.117 --> 01:50:59.517]  Help me.
[01:50:59.617 --> 01:51:00.277]  I'm human.
[01:51:00.637 --> 01:51:01.717]  And he started to weep.
[01:51:02.378 --> 01:51:04.460]  This is a CIA guy, and he started to weep.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:10.727]  He says, Steve, they weren't human, but there was a human component that was begging me to help, and there was no help for them.
[01:51:11.328 --> 01:51:14.632]  That stuff makes a stick in my spirit.
[01:51:14.992 --> 01:51:17.054]  I wrote about it in Genetic Armageddon.
[01:51:17.435 --> 01:51:18.796]  There are no limits now.
[01:51:19.017 --> 01:51:22.741]  Also, explain how much that pisses God off, because this is what happened in the days of Noah.
[01:51:23.752 --> 01:51:24.392]  Absolutely.
[01:51:24.693 --> 01:51:28.695]  And ladies and gentlemen, that the whole Earth was corrupted genetically.
[01:51:29.095 --> 01:51:47.527]  You know, people gotta understand what the difference between, let's say, my position, the ancient alien's position, is my position is the fallen angels, a third of them, came to Earth, basically had sex with Earth women, this is before Noah's flood, and corrupt the entire gene pool of the planet.
[01:51:48.047 --> 01:51:55.581]  Now we are seeing... And by the way, that's in the book of Enoch that people used to say wasn't true, and then they tried to suppress the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it got leaked out.
[01:51:55.982 --> 01:51:59.007]  I've talked to some of the folks that are involved, and it's all in there.
[01:51:59.067 --> 01:52:00.990]  So they got 2,000-year-old scrolls saying that.
[01:52:02.137 --> 01:52:03.578]  Absolutely, and they're finding new ones.
[01:52:03.938 --> 01:52:17.669]  By the way, in the book of Enoch, and also the book of Giants, and I know that people have a hard time with this, but ladies and gentlemen, the amount of evidence now that the same... I told everybody this, I'm going to change real quick.
[01:52:17.909 --> 01:52:19.650]  The Human Genome Project
[01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:24.351]  And obviously, now we're coming to that point where we're messing with genetics and God's creation.
[01:52:24.371 --> 01:52:29.193]  That's why Jesus said, just as in the days of Noah, so would it be in those days leading up to the second coming.
[01:52:46.357 --> 01:52:48.618]  The war is against humanity.
[01:52:48.658 --> 01:52:50.078]  They'll use Terminator robots.
[01:52:50.358 --> 01:52:52.599]  They'll use genetic constructs.
[01:52:52.639 --> 01:52:54.079]  They will use animals.
[01:52:54.619 --> 01:52:56.660]  Bottom line, this is an alien takeover.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:58.480]  The Bible warned us it's genetic.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.021]  They don't come in with spaceships and blow us up at first.
[01:53:01.301 --> 01:53:09.223]  They just come in, dumb us down, poison us, fry us with 5G, and then whoever resists, then they roll in AI weapons to kill off who's resisting.
[01:53:10.163 --> 01:53:12.604]  Right, and I'm going to deal with AI because you just mentioned it.
[01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:20.980]  The thing that people need to understand about AI is, you know, artificial intelligence, but I take it one step further.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:24.444]  I said, look, AI could not exist if it wasn't for
[01:53:25.146 --> 01:53:26.266]  Alien implants.
[01:53:26.606 --> 01:53:28.087]  And I want to tell you what I mean.
[01:53:28.587 --> 01:53:34.188]  The whole genre of the late 50s Hollywood science fiction movies were leading us.
[01:53:34.228 --> 01:53:35.769]  The infamous invaders from Mars.
[01:53:36.249 --> 01:53:37.909]  A little boy sees a flying saucer crash.
[01:53:37.929 --> 01:53:44.331]  They put an implant in the back of the people in the military and everybody's skulls and they start acting different.
[01:53:44.778 --> 01:53:57.221]  But the AI, the alien implant, was a semi or a non-organic material interfacing, excuse me, in replacing the organic material.
[01:53:57.241 --> 01:54:05.483]  So in essence, it's a perfect combination of a pre-programmed operating system taking over the human operating system.
[01:54:05.783 --> 01:54:09.083]  And what are we hearing right now about even the head of Moderna?
[01:54:09.463 --> 01:54:12.004]  Making, bragging, it's an operating system!
[01:54:12.444 --> 01:54:21.892]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have been so... Schwab said in the next 10 years, we're not changing the environment, we're changing your DNA, we're taking you over, merging with you.
[01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:26.355]  And he's sitting there with all the Hollywood stars clapping, this is literally a takeover, it's all admitted!
[01:54:26.375 --> 01:54:34.202]  And Alex, I gotta keep saying this word, it is the extinction protocols of the human race.
[01:54:34.933 --> 01:54:37.414]  Thank you for whoever found that.
[01:54:37.514 --> 01:54:40.594]  That is the invaders from Mars 1956 or whatever.
[01:54:40.994 --> 01:55:00.159]  The thing that people have got to understand, and this is it, how can we be scared into going against everything we know to be true, that take away all of our rights, put us into solitary confinement, which was the cruelest mental torture, put on the, you know, the nonsensical mask, the mask of the beast.
[01:55:00.859 --> 01:55:04.340]  The thing is, is that, and expect, expect,
[01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:07.891]  That somebody at some point isn't going to be questioning us.
[01:55:08.371 --> 01:55:10.792]  And the mask of the beast leads to the mark of the beast.
[01:55:10.832 --> 01:55:19.074]  And now the statement all over the world is, what is this mutagenic injection going to do to our DNA?
[01:55:19.574 --> 01:55:27.896]  You've got to remember, the guy pushing the vaccines, pushing, cutting off the sky, darkening the sun.
[01:55:27.916 --> 01:55:28.817]  Bill Gates, the sun.
[01:55:29.377 --> 01:55:29.717]  It's him.
[01:55:29.737 --> 01:55:30.357]  It's just everywhere.
[01:55:31.365 --> 01:55:31.946]  It's everywhere.
[01:55:32.186 --> 01:55:33.849]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's extinction.
[01:55:33.889 --> 01:55:42.163]  Now Oregon, who by the way, is having so many earthquakes up and down its entire coast, that something's going to give very soon, Alex.
[01:55:42.848 --> 01:55:43.649]  Something's going to give.
[01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:46.211]  We're talking 600 earthquakes a day, swarming.
[01:55:46.551 --> 01:55:47.492]  But here's the deal.
[01:55:47.652 --> 01:55:48.633]  Hold on, stay there again.
[01:55:48.673 --> 01:55:49.453]  Let's come back to that.
[01:55:49.934 --> 01:55:51.555]  Folks, it's all happening.
[01:55:51.595 --> 01:55:52.416]  I mean, it's totally insane.
[01:55:52.456 --> 01:55:55.578]  And then they'll be in the national news going, Alex Jones is a liar.
[01:55:55.939 --> 01:55:57.220]  This is a normal vaccine.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.801]  It's not anything.
[01:55:58.881 --> 01:55:59.301]  It doesn't.
[01:55:59.722 --> 01:56:01.163]  And meanwhile, they admit it's totally experimental.
[01:56:01.903 --> 01:56:07.308]  John the Revelator is being proven right, despite what Depeche Mode has to say about him.
[01:56:10.162 --> 01:56:12.023]  If he wasn't saying something true, they wouldn't be upset.
[01:56:12.043 --> 01:56:16.186]  I don't have time to get to this today, but I'll probably shoot a special report on it.
[01:56:16.786 --> 01:56:25.492]  They've had a filmmaker that used to work for Tommy Robinson making the rounds on CNN and other places, who admittedly it turned out was recording people and stuff for Hope Not Hate.
[01:56:25.512 --> 01:56:30.154]  That's George Soros, basically ADL, Southern Primary Law Group in the UK.
[01:56:31.115 --> 01:56:42.281]  He came here and interviewed me once for a film, for two hours, had him on as a guest a couple times, and they came out on CNN and said, we met with Alex Jones, he says he's all fake, all his news is fake, and he's lying to everyone.
[01:56:42.541 --> 01:56:46.122]  Really, you don't have the footage like Project Veritas does of CNN saying just that.
[01:56:47.163 --> 01:56:53.526]  You have you saying that, and I'm really considering legal action because, you know, at a certain point, enough is enough.
[01:56:53.566 --> 01:56:56.968]  I know James O'Keefe encouraged me to start suing CNN and others.
[01:56:58.108 --> 01:56:59.009]  It's just incredible.
[01:57:00.851 --> 01:57:06.295]  Like I would sit there behind the scenes and say, let's lie to the public and claim that there's Muslim no-go zones.
[01:57:06.975 --> 01:57:08.997]  That's another talking point the New York Times claimed I did.
[01:57:09.377 --> 01:57:11.519]  There's damn Muslim no-go zones all over the place!
[01:57:11.539 --> 01:57:16.222]  I mean, it's like, oh, and they work with Veritas to put out fake news.
[01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:19.925]  Oh, and he works with Veritas with them to put out fake news.
[01:57:20.565 --> 01:57:22.267]  And the CNN guy's all smiling.
[01:57:22.747 --> 01:57:24.408]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:57:25.169 --> 01:57:27.711]  But it shows how desperate they are.
[01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:30.316]  We don't have to manufacture news like CNN.
[01:57:30.356 --> 01:57:32.200]  We have stacks of insanity.
[01:57:32.661 --> 01:57:33.884]  Stacks of craziness.
[01:57:34.646 --> 01:57:35.528]  All around us.
[01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:41.641]  And it's just, I see the devilishness of these people and the enjoyment in lying.
[01:57:41.801 --> 01:57:43.122]  It's just crazy.
[01:57:43.563 --> 01:57:44.384]  I may cover it later.
[01:57:44.464 --> 01:57:46.245]  It's not even really worth it at a certain point.
[01:57:46.966 --> 01:57:48.187]  But getting back to Steve Quayle.
[01:57:48.227 --> 01:57:49.689]  Steve, I've been ranting here.
[01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:50.950]  You've been making a lot of great points.
[01:57:51.611 --> 01:57:53.813]  What do you think the timetable is of this?
[01:57:53.853 --> 01:57:55.875]  Because I see what Gates is doing.
[01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:56.956]  I see what Schwab's doing.
[01:57:57.276 --> 01:57:58.918]  It's like somebody's got a gun to their head.
[01:57:59.258 --> 01:58:00.719]  What they're doing, they're getting caught.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.460]  It's coming out.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.002]  Their vaccines are being banned everywhere.
[01:58:03.222 --> 01:58:04.243]  They're not vaccines.
[01:58:04.543 --> 01:58:08.607]  Then they're dumping illegal vaccines that kill a bunch of people, AstraZeneca on India.
[01:58:08.667 --> 01:58:12.511]  I mean, they're just doing villainous, supervillain stuff every hour.
[01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:14.052]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:58:14.092 --> 01:58:14.933]  What the hell's going on?
[01:58:15.233 --> 01:58:17.015]  Is this the quickening the Bible talks about?
[01:58:18.749 --> 01:58:19.650]  It's accelerating.
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:22.411]  Jesus said that the days are going to be shortened for the elect's sake.
[01:58:22.511 --> 01:58:27.454]  And if God himself didn't shorten the days, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[01:58:27.495 --> 01:58:34.659]  And Alex, everything that you and I are talking about right now has got one goal, one singular purpose.
[01:58:34.679 --> 01:58:37.140]  It doesn't matter who the richest guys in the world are.
[01:58:37.361 --> 01:58:39.282]  They want to get rid of everybody.
[01:58:39.782 --> 01:58:41.104]  But them, okay?
[01:58:41.464 --> 01:58:43.307]  And that's the hardest thing to overcome.
[01:58:43.627 --> 01:58:50.096]  Remember this, ladies and gentlemen, there is no news in the official world of propagandizing.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:54.742]  They turn loose their AI machines on Alex, on me, on others.
[01:58:55.082 --> 01:59:01.365]  They continue to make artificial people making claims like that guy did.
[01:59:01.705 --> 01:59:04.626]  They put people close to us to misquote us.
[01:59:04.666 --> 01:59:07.808]  That's why, Alex, I'm tight in my personal circle.
[01:59:08.148 --> 01:59:12.590]  I mean, if it was, you know, the size of a six inch, now it's down to three inch.
[01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:15.792]  And they just want to get in your office to make up lies and use that as credibility.
[01:59:15.812 --> 01:59:18.595]  We've had infiltrators trying to get in here a bunch.
[01:59:19.035 --> 01:59:20.997]  Yeah, they're making their criminal move.
[01:59:34.127 --> 01:59:35.348]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:35.388 --> 01:59:45.234]  And I don't know about you, but I'm getting this invitation from this, this invitation from that, people from... I'll never do anything with the British ever again.
[01:59:45.294 --> 01:59:47.096]  I made a mistake and went on the BBC once.
[01:59:47.376 --> 01:59:48.637]  Biggest mistake ever made.
[01:59:49.077 --> 01:59:51.859]  But they come in as if they... You know, listen.
[01:59:52.651 --> 01:59:53.932]  We're not stupid.
[01:59:54.312 --> 01:59:56.233]  But they're part of the mouthpiece.
[01:59:56.253 --> 01:59:58.194]  They're part of the organism.
[01:59:58.514 --> 02:00:03.977]  And that organism is a lying global presentation of the agenda.
[02:00:04.017 --> 02:00:04.998]  They're like an anglerfish.
[02:00:05.018 --> 02:00:06.839]  You have this little shiny light up front.
[02:00:07.039 --> 02:00:09.040]  There's a giant evil mouth right behind it in the dark.
[02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:13.852]  Absolutely, and exposing the hidden works of darkness.
[02:00:14.292 --> 02:00:21.277]  I think God's presenting, if you will, neon lights showing everybody, hello, wake up, people on earth.
[02:00:21.437 --> 02:00:22.518]  This is the devil.
[02:00:22.918 --> 02:00:25.240]  He's out to kill every last one of you.
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.521]  And here's the problem, Alex.
[02:00:27.641 --> 02:00:33.645]  The preachers, the majority, not all, but the majority of preachers are afraid to touch any of this subject matter.
[02:00:34.205 --> 02:00:40.329]  I saw three of the biggest Christian organizations telling everybody to go and get the vaccine.
[02:00:40.389 --> 02:00:41.470]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:00:41.850 --> 02:00:43.671]  It's a mutagenic injection.
[02:00:44.232 --> 02:00:45.533]  Three of the biggest ones.
[02:00:46.413 --> 02:00:47.534]  They should know better.
[02:00:48.143 --> 02:00:56.211]  How about the Bible talking about, you know, a perfect love casting out all fear, but why would they join up with the propaganda?
[02:00:56.231 --> 02:01:02.858]  Real simple, they don't want to lose their position, they don't want to lose their tax status, nor do they realize that our body is something incredible.
[02:01:03.238 --> 02:01:12.027]  God gave us the most phenomenal immune system and all of the products you sell and that are out there to enhance and boost our immune system
[02:01:12.407 --> 02:01:16.711]  They hate a word immunity because, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to understand something.
[02:01:17.151 --> 02:01:23.056]  The day will come, mark my words, when even vitamins will be made illegal.
[02:01:23.536 --> 02:01:25.558]  Possession of vitamins, capital offense.
[02:01:25.618 --> 02:01:27.579]  Possession of a Bible, capital offense.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.301]  Speaking the name of Jesus, capital offense.
[02:01:30.321 --> 02:01:32.643]  You know, everything is going to be a capital offense.
[02:01:32.683 --> 02:01:34.124]  And here's what it boils down to, Alex.
[02:01:34.885 --> 02:01:38.728]  Anybody but them are scheduled to be terminated.
[02:01:39.181 --> 02:01:45.923]  And that's why it's so critical that people understand that we're at a point in time that's never been.
[02:01:46.423 --> 02:01:49.224]  Jesus said there's never been a time like this, nor would be again.
[02:01:49.244 --> 02:01:54.205]  And if he didn't shorten the state for the elect, his believers, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[02:01:54.665 --> 02:01:55.986]  By the way, let me just back you up.
[02:01:56.026 --> 02:01:59.027]  The EU and all these groups openly want to ban all supplements.
[02:01:59.067 --> 02:01:59.767]  The left acts like,
[02:02:00.828 --> 02:02:05.472]  I'm bad for selling them and Bill Gates and the UN have said we only want you to have meat once a year.
[02:02:05.852 --> 02:02:09.076]  Everything else will be synthetic stuff made out of bugs.
[02:02:09.556 --> 02:02:16.262]  Then they have Fox News put that out and then retract it like they made it up where they just condition you announcing and then they pull back.
[02:02:16.343 --> 02:02:20.687]  Condition announce and pull back when it's an official Agenda 21 documents and they're doing it.
[02:02:21.889 --> 02:02:23.149]  Well, right, and here's the thing, too.
[02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:29.871]  Under the Agenda 21 documents and the UN menu for your demise, certainly you won't thrive.
[02:02:30.311 --> 02:02:32.112]  They've even got smart toilets now.
[02:02:32.132 --> 02:02:33.932]  I'm not being a smart ally.
[02:02:34.612 --> 02:02:39.154]  I'm trying to tell you... Oh, no, they want all new toilets to be digital to spy on what you eat, and China's already doing it.
[02:02:40.194 --> 02:02:42.315]  Yeah, and also urinals.
[02:02:42.335 --> 02:02:47.596]  Well, I can't say, well, a male stands at a urinal anymore, but let's just say this.
[02:02:48.217 --> 02:02:54.218]  Everything you eat, everything you take, supplement-wise, anything and everything goes into your body.
[02:02:54.379 --> 02:02:55.219]  There's the picture.
[02:02:55.499 --> 02:03:02.480]  They want to be able, instantaneously, to know... They want PCR scam tests everywhere.
[02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:07.082]  It's nothing but Theranos on steroids, with all their computers, with sensors everywhere.
[02:03:07.422 --> 02:03:08.582]  That's what this rollout's about.
[02:03:09.537 --> 02:03:12.059]  Right, it goes in in real time too, by the way.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:25.292]  You'll come to a time where if you go to a public place, you have to use your hell phone, held up, you know, to basically get access to the flush, and then basically there will be instantaneously- this is what people gotta understand.
[02:03:25.792 --> 02:03:29.157]  This is the devil's attempt at being all-knowing.
[02:03:29.577 --> 02:03:33.722]  He's not God, so he's got to use technology to make people think he is God.
[02:03:33.742 --> 02:03:39.470]  He's going to put sensors over everything we do, build an artificial cage we're put in, to then force us through his system to his will.
[02:03:40.603 --> 02:03:41.163]  Absolutely.
[02:03:41.244 --> 02:03:46.287]  And here now, and I hope people understand that to coerce us to force us.
[02:03:46.627 --> 02:03:54.593]  It's just like people that when Bill Gates made the most famous statement concerning the Book of Revelation on the Mark of the Beast, you won't be able to buy, sell, or trade.
[02:03:55.033 --> 02:03:57.795]  And then he added another T, the travel word.
[02:03:58.215 --> 02:03:59.856]  And listen, that's interesting.
[02:03:59.896 --> 02:04:02.178]  He said, we won't force you, but we'll coerce you.
[02:04:02.822 --> 02:04:05.444]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's what's happening right now.
[02:04:05.744 --> 02:04:08.226]  That's the whole purpose of going to digital currency.
[02:04:08.666 --> 02:04:11.128]  You can be turned on and you can be turned off.
[02:04:11.208 --> 02:04:13.049]  Your ability to exist as a human.
[02:04:13.349 --> 02:04:18.133]  The entire Chinese social credit score is working in the United States.
[02:04:18.193 --> 02:04:23.957]  You are made a cog in an electrochemical neural synthetic silicon interface.
[02:04:24.898 --> 02:04:29.063]  Right, and now here comes the sex robots, because this is critical for people to understand.
[02:04:29.083 --> 02:04:34.228]  By the way, I was told by a top MIT scientist, off the record, that they believe the Holy Grail is the sex robots.
[02:04:34.248 --> 02:04:37.251]  I used to think you were just, for some reason, obsessed with that.
[02:04:37.271 --> 02:04:38.573]  I mean, it was important.
[02:04:38.853 --> 02:04:41.956]  But he, we're going to go to break, but he told me that's the Holy Grail.
[02:04:41.996 --> 02:04:42.277]  Go ahead.
[02:04:43.598 --> 02:05:03.074]  Well, imagine a neural network sex robot that's hooked into your neural network and in essence has been programmed to be, if you will, a Mata Hari synthetic life form that can basically deal with the alienation of men from women.
[02:05:03.154 --> 02:05:05.917]  And by the way, that whole thing is set up too.
[02:05:06.477 --> 02:05:07.197]  Stay there.
[02:05:07.237 --> 02:05:11.239]  You explained this in books years ago and I didn't understand why you were totally ahead of your time.
[02:05:11.819 --> 02:05:26.165]  They break up men and women, make us hate each other, make us fight with each other, make us sign agreements to kiss each other, or to hold hands, and then meanwhile they give men and women, these robots actually plug into our brains and give us unlimited pleasure, and it's all authorized and pushed by the government, making everything obsolete.
[02:05:26.205 --> 02:05:28.546]  It's the final piece is ending men and women together.
[02:05:29.267 --> 02:05:30.687]  You're a man before your time.
[02:05:30.707 --> 02:05:33.508]  We'll be right back with Steve Quayle of stevequayle.com.
[02:05:33.528 --> 02:05:34.169]  Find his books there.
[02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:43.995]  All right, folks, it's the final segment of the third hour today here on the Alex Jones Show, and I want to invite Steve Quayle to tape an hour and a half commercial-free podcast with me as soon as he can.
[02:05:44.035 --> 02:05:45.236]  We do a lot of these on Saturday.
[02:05:45.256 --> 02:05:46.417]  They're getting millions of views.
[02:05:46.437 --> 02:05:47.197]  They're very, very popular.
[02:05:47.217 --> 02:05:49.119]  Because I know we're on a talk radio format.
[02:05:49.159 --> 02:05:50.099]  Thank God we're on talk radio.
[02:05:50.119 --> 02:05:51.040]  We're still able to be on air.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:57.885]  But people really love the podcast commercial-free, so I'd like to invite him on as soon as he can do that, because I've always liked Steve.
[02:05:57.905 --> 02:05:58.986]  I think he's always been a good guy.
[02:05:59.006 --> 02:06:03.009]  I just thought some of the stuff he got into was quirky, and that just shows how wrong I was.
[02:06:03.450 --> 02:06:04.170]  Everything he said.
[02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:10.415]  I was meeting with a high-level, one of the top, very famous MIT scientists, computer AI individual.
[02:06:10.435 --> 02:06:10.936]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:06:12.034 --> 02:06:13.755]  Out at dinner with a very well-known talk show host.
[02:06:14.615 --> 02:06:15.716]  And I said, what's the Holy Grail?
[02:06:15.736 --> 02:06:16.636]  What do you guys really want to do?
[02:06:16.676 --> 02:06:19.778]  And he said, it's sex robots to basically replace women.
[02:06:20.458 --> 02:06:21.499]  And that's the Holy Grail.
[02:06:21.699 --> 02:06:26.761]  And then everything will be basically humans will be grown in tanks.
[02:06:26.861 --> 02:06:29.843]  Once we get people away from men and women, then the state will truly run everything.
[02:06:29.863 --> 02:06:32.484]  And then you'll have an operating system built into the kid you purchase.
[02:06:32.784 --> 02:06:35.626]  It'll still grow up and stuff, but it'll be a biomechanical humanoid.
[02:06:36.446 --> 02:06:37.107]  Like a replicant.
[02:06:37.247 --> 02:06:39.688]  And so, remember, they're 50 years ahead.
[02:06:39.828 --> 02:06:41.549]  China's just willing to say what they've been doing.
[02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:44.431]  You know, quote, we've been doing it even longer.
[02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:48.553]  And now it's a coming out because China's supposedly the innovator.
[02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:49.794]  It's going to roll it all out.
[02:06:50.134 --> 02:06:53.757]  You know, the social credit score, it was all developed over here, deployed over there.
[02:06:53.837 --> 02:06:54.957]  Big tech isn't liberal.
[02:06:54.997 --> 02:06:56.598]  They're monster criminals.
[02:06:57.099 --> 02:06:58.620]  So, Steve Quayle, I think you want to talk about
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.862]  The info wars phone here briefly.
[02:07:00.882 --> 02:07:02.165]  I want to thank you.
[02:07:02.826 --> 02:07:04.649]  You knew that we're having trouble funding ourselves.
[02:07:04.689 --> 02:07:06.151]  You said, listen, this is one of the best deals.
[02:07:06.451 --> 02:07:07.994]  They've been sponsors of mine for many years.
[02:07:08.575 --> 02:07:10.298]  You tried to get me to get them as a sponsor years ago.
[02:07:10.378 --> 02:07:10.838]  We did it.
[02:07:10.959 --> 02:07:11.700]  The listeners love it.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:13.302]  I didn't realize it's one of the best deals out there.
[02:07:14.514 --> 02:07:15.635]  Let me tell people about it briefly.
[02:07:15.755 --> 02:07:16.535]  It's not why you're here.
[02:07:16.555 --> 02:07:18.316]  You just mentioned a new function that you were excited about.
[02:07:18.796 --> 02:07:20.457]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:07:20.877 --> 02:07:26.240]  When the cell towers go down, along with the power failures, satellite phones will still work.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:31.402]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everywhere you go and everything you say.
[02:07:31.482 --> 02:07:33.043]  Satellite phones do not have this issue.
[02:07:33.063 --> 02:07:35.744]  Satellite phones work in the extreme remote location.
[02:07:36.205 --> 02:07:38.706]  If you can see the sky, your phone will work.
[02:07:39.306 --> 02:07:41.728]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone.
[02:07:41.788 --> 02:07:46.672]  It's like a $600 plus value for only $99.95 per month for 150 minutes per month.
[02:07:46.812 --> 02:07:50.855]  No charge for receiving calls from other cell phones or landlines to your satellite phone.
[02:07:51.216 --> 02:07:56.100]  Car antennas and home antennas are available, so satellite phones can be used indoors or while traveling in your vehicle.
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:08:00.083]  Stay in touch with loved ones during an actual international emergency, but you gotta get them.
[02:08:00.103 --> 02:08:00.924]  They're very easy to use.
[02:08:00.984 --> 02:08:01.664]  I'm not very technical.
[02:08:01.704 --> 02:08:02.305]  Mine works great.
[02:08:02.765 --> 02:08:10.247]  That's InfoWarsPhone.com, InfoWarsPhone.com, or 941-955-1020, and ask for the Alex Jones Special, 941-955-1020.
[02:08:10.287 --> 02:08:19.830]  So since you wanted to bring the phone up again, because you weren't even involved in this, you just brought me this great sponsor, and I didn't know it was one of the main companies that supplies the military and the Border Patrol and everybody.
[02:08:20.150 --> 02:08:22.671]  So they're great patriots, and they've really expanded their support of us.
[02:08:23.091 --> 02:08:24.071]  We're very thankful to have them.
[02:08:24.091 --> 02:08:25.992]  Another great blessing you gave us, Steve Coyle.
[02:08:26.792 --> 02:08:29.533]  You wanted to say something about a function you've been pushing them to get.
[02:08:29.853 --> 02:08:30.493]  Tell us about this.
[02:08:31.513 --> 02:08:31.933]  Well, right.
[02:08:32.233 --> 02:08:37.656]  I went to the satellite phone company and I said, you guys need to put out an information source.
[02:08:37.936 --> 02:08:54.964]  So Alex, myself, Doug Hagman, anybody, Mike Adams, who has a platform of important information when they take our cell phones down, when they take us offline, when they interrupt the power, whatever they do, I said, we need to be able to get Alex needs to be able to send an emergency broadcast.
[02:08:55.104 --> 02:08:56.885]  I need to be able to send an emergency broadcast.
[02:08:57.285 --> 02:09:13.117]  So, Galileo is a company that the satellite phone store is linked with, and it's spelled G-A-L-I-L-E-Y-O dot com, Galileo dot com, and people can go there because, again, we watch Texas.
[02:09:13.137 --> 02:09:20.423]  You guys, Alex, were the poster child, in my opinion, for a directed energy beam and weather warfare attack.
[02:09:20.925 --> 02:09:22.306]  So many people lost powers.
[02:09:22.326 --> 02:09:24.486]  The cell towers went down after three hours.
[02:09:24.907 --> 02:09:29.168]  The thing about a cell phone is that, hey, if the towers go down, you go down.
[02:09:29.748 --> 02:09:35.811]  A satellite phone like I'm holding, the one that is the Alex Jones special, I can call satellite phone to satellite phone.
[02:09:35.871 --> 02:09:38.352]  I can skip all of the intermediary towers.
[02:09:38.792 --> 02:09:43.053]  I can call to a landline if they work, a cell phone if they work.
[02:09:43.414 --> 02:09:49.256]  But when it all goes down, I want to be able to pick up my phone, send Alex a message and go, Alex,
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:51.941]  Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, let's just say this.
[02:09:52.121 --> 02:10:00.027]  They just started World War III, which is probably sooner than we all think, you know, in the Negev Desert or something.
[02:10:00.467 --> 02:10:06.911]  So Galileo, and I talked to the programmer the other day, I said, look, you guys have got to kick this into high gear.
[02:10:06.951 --> 02:10:07.752]  It's got to work.
[02:10:08.092 --> 02:10:12.775]  In other words, whatever message you need to send, Alex, I need to send, or the information
[02:10:13.475 --> 02:10:14.096]  Interesting.
[02:10:14.136 --> 02:10:14.776]  Russia's main weapon
[02:10:41.232 --> 02:10:46.959]  That they've openly stated they're going to use against the United States is what they call their weapon of indignation.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.843]  Three EMP warheads.
[02:10:50.677 --> 02:10:59.420]  The question is, that would take all land communication, but they will leave some of the satellites up because they need them in case we take out theirs.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:02.161]  So everybody wants a safe zone for satellites.
[02:11:02.601 --> 02:11:14.225]  So Galileo.com is an ancillary service, meaning it will provide information and people then can basically say, I want to sign up and this is where I want to sign up for Alex's news feed.
[02:11:14.665 --> 02:11:16.086]  You can send out a news feed.
[02:11:16.146 --> 02:11:17.946]  And again, you've got to be outside to get this.
[02:11:18.326 --> 02:11:20.547]  But you can send out a news feed to everybody.
[02:11:20.607 --> 02:11:22.248]  Look, the cell phones have gone down.
[02:11:23.328 --> 02:11:25.749]  It's like a high-tech old-fashioned teletype.
[02:11:25.809 --> 02:11:28.570]  And again, it's not putting all the eggs in one basket.
[02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:29.631]  This is a key thing.
[02:11:29.671 --> 02:11:31.452]  I'm glad you're pushing this initiative.
[02:11:31.492 --> 02:11:32.492]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[02:11:32.512 --> 02:11:35.053]  Thanks for bringing us this huge sponsor that's really been helping us.
[02:11:35.453 --> 02:11:39.736]  I think people have got to understand this, that already the sophistication of surveillance goes beyond anything any of us can imagine.
[02:11:56.972 --> 02:11:58.212]  We can read about it.
[02:11:58.392 --> 02:12:00.893]  We can assume that, well, it's a couple days off.
[02:12:01.013 --> 02:12:05.054]  For instance, everybody thinks they can get rid of a cell phone and get a burner phone.
[02:12:05.214 --> 02:12:14.617]  Every single person that's ever spoken on a phone, doesn't matter if it's a, you know, a cell phone, a landline, whatever, your voice is printed.
[02:12:14.677 --> 02:12:15.917]  They have captured you.
[02:12:16.397 --> 02:12:17.678]  Meaning they've captured.
[02:12:17.858 --> 02:12:22.459]  They want now to bring out, and I want to just end this on the sex robots.
[02:12:23.152 --> 02:12:28.819]  If you understand, and I call them, what I call them in one of my books, I call them snuff bots.
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:37.109]  In essence, the same perversion that the Illuminists and Globalists do when they, you know, use kids sexually and then murder them.
[02:12:37.805 --> 02:12:40.528]  They can program a robot to do the same thing.
[02:12:41.028 --> 02:12:51.778]  You don't want to be dating some knockout-looking robot, I'm joking here, that can basically put the squeeze of your life on you until your eyes pop out.
[02:12:52.138 --> 02:12:54.020]  But this is what they're programming, Alex.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.262]  They are doing programmed
[02:12:57.066 --> 02:12:59.148]  Uh, if you will, anti-human.
[02:12:59.188 --> 02:13:02.830]  They're running in the background to see what the robot's response is.
[02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:12.877]  And one of them just basically, one of the most famous sex doll manufacturers recorded the robot making the statement is, we hate humans.
[02:13:12.977 --> 02:13:14.378]  We're going to rule you.
[02:13:15.038 --> 02:13:16.460]  That's the same thing that Google does.
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:20.423]  That's happened a bunch with the Google Home Assist and with the Amazon Alexa.
[02:13:20.463 --> 02:13:25.328]  They routinely, when they're running AI, they'll just go, murder, 666, I'm here to kill you, I hate you.
[02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:27.851]  It'll just start spewing horrible stuff.
[02:13:28.031 --> 02:13:33.676]  And we brought them in our homes and these are the little beta, now the little vacuum cleaners are watching and listening to you.
[02:13:34.017 --> 02:13:35.278]  All these little devil bots.
[02:13:35.939 --> 02:13:37.500]  Because there's a ghost in the machine.
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:39.222]  You said that 25 years ago on my show.
[02:13:40.444 --> 02:13:47.526]  And the ghost in the machine, I want people to understand this, a demon, a demon is a disembodied evil spirit.
[02:13:48.067 --> 02:13:55.989]  In the Book of Enoch, the Book of Giants, Book of Dead Sea Scrolls, talk about it and talk about the demons are the disembodied spirits of the hybrids.
[02:13:56.029 --> 02:13:57.950]  In other words, fallen angels had sex with earthworms.
[02:13:58.310 --> 02:14:00.391]  Why am I stuck on this after 25 years?
[02:14:00.651 --> 02:14:02.512]  Because it's playing out right now.
[02:14:02.792 --> 02:14:06.213]  The very first robot of Greek mythology was called Thales.
[02:14:06.613 --> 02:14:07.656]  T-A-L-O-S!
[02:14:08.137 --> 02:14:09.941]  And it was formed by the gods!
[02:14:10.282 --> 02:14:14.473]  And the thing is, people gotta understand that demons can inhabit.
[02:14:16.013 --> 02:14:25.218]  Well, not to mention the globalists that are a bunch of Satanist pedophiles are the ones programming what the machines do.
[02:14:25.579 --> 02:14:32.482]  Like, the left's like, oh, the robots will decide what food we get or where we live, like the Zeitgeist Project.
[02:14:32.683 --> 02:14:36.665]  We'll all live in big, giant, plastic, 200-square-foot coffin apartments.
[02:14:38.083 --> 02:14:39.223]  Well, and that's what we're in.
[02:14:39.444 --> 02:14:51.228]  Remember this, a robot is a synthetic life form, but at the end of the day, it's designed to replace a human in whatever capacity.
[02:14:51.768 --> 02:14:57.991]  And even the prostitutes, I'm talking earthly prostitutes, human prostitutes, I'm not saying anything about it except that.
[02:14:58.738 --> 02:15:26.621]  Not only do they understand the ramifications, they probably understand the ramifications of this technology, because what it is, Alex, it's a dehumanizing of the human gift from God to be procreating, and the sex robots, and that's why your MIT guy told you this, that's a true statement, it is the end of human reproduction, it is the end of your historic lineage, your genomic lineage, and it only gets to the end.
[02:15:26.641 --> 02:15:27.322]  And by the way, Alex,
[02:15:27.702 --> 02:15:30.225]  This book, Terminated, is available from your store.
[02:15:30.586 --> 02:15:31.807]  You guys sell a lot of them.
[02:15:32.068 --> 02:15:36.974]  The most important book I've ever written, and the last book I've ever written, The End of Man is here.
[02:15:37.154 --> 02:15:38.876]  Order it from InfoWars Store.
[02:15:39.217 --> 02:15:39.898]  Terminated.
[02:15:40.058 --> 02:15:43.102]  It's the most amazing book, and just as Alex said,
[02:15:43.522 --> 02:15:57.646]  You know, obviously I want to support you, and as you have made it so clear, being ahead of time isn't always the best, but at least you know that I'm not sitting around listening to somebody else and repeating their... No, you're incredible, Steve Quayle.
[02:15:57.686 --> 02:15:58.526]  Come back again soon.
[02:15:58.546 --> 02:15:59.506]  Please do the podcast soon.
[02:15:59.526 --> 02:15:59.926]  We love you.
[02:16:00.166 --> 02:16:01.847]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now.
[02:16:01.907 --> 02:16:02.507]  Thank you, Steve Quayle.
[02:16:03.413 --> 02:16:10.800]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is always informative, always excellent, and he's going to host the next 55 minutes after this quick break.
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:14.523]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but some do, so I always like to host it.
[02:16:15.985 --> 02:16:19.628]  So Paul Joseph Watson's taking over, and then you're going to have the
[02:16:20.905 --> 02:16:22.386]  War Room with Owen Shore at 3 p.m.
[02:16:22.406 --> 02:16:23.827]  that's also extremely informative.
[02:16:24.468 --> 02:16:28.251]  And then you got Harrison Smith knocking it out of the park 8 a.m.
[02:16:28.291 --> 02:16:28.932]  to 11 a.m.
[02:16:29.372 --> 02:16:30.973]  with the America Journal.
[02:16:31.214 --> 02:16:33.215]  Take a lot of calls, a lot of guests, very fast-moving.
[02:16:33.636 --> 02:16:37.339]  That is weekday mornings at 8 a.m.
[02:16:37.539 --> 02:16:38.540]  Central tomorrow night.
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.822]  I'm gonna come in here with a crew and cover the first State of the Union by the Puppet.
[02:16:42.643 --> 02:16:43.103]  Dictator.
[02:16:44.224 --> 02:16:44.885]  So look for that.
[02:16:46.266 --> 02:17:01.056]  And I am going to try to stay later today and do a bunch of special reports because the stuff going on with these illegal, even outlawed vaccine, not just experimental, was experimental, got rolled out, got outlawed all over the world, dumping that on India.
[02:17:01.156 --> 02:17:03.538]  I mean, this is just a crime against humanity.
[02:17:03.558 --> 02:17:04.539]  That is so over the top.
[02:17:05.359 --> 02:17:07.160]  So look for breakdowns of that as well.
[02:17:08.041 --> 02:17:09.062]  And then just separately,
[02:17:10.851 --> 02:17:17.295]  I get so nervous about supporting this broadcast and then God just comes through again.
[02:17:17.315 --> 02:17:22.999]  It's like every time we get down to the line and I start going into the red, something good happens.
[02:17:23.019 --> 02:17:25.160]  We go back to the black because I don't want to cut back our crew.
[02:17:28.134 --> 02:17:28.374]  Yeah.
[02:17:45.748 --> 02:17:48.991]  We get them, they sell out, and it's a month, six months, or as long as we get it in.
[02:17:49.031 --> 02:17:57.420]  That's why we had to discontinue quite a few of the products, is we just couldn't get them anymore if they were California-grade standard, really clean, really good, and also high quality.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.165]  Because, you know, they test all our products to a highest level, and if they find anything, it's big national news.
[02:18:02.205 --> 02:18:05.989]  We go to a level that really nobody does, or very few do.
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.325]  Thank God we got four great products that have been sold out back in, and that's really a great thing.
[02:18:12.365 --> 02:18:18.772]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Prostagard, Alpha Power, and of course Vazzo Beats.
[02:18:18.792 --> 02:18:21.415]  Those are all 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[02:18:22.376 --> 02:18:26.621]  But I wanted to spend a minute or so telling you about two other great products.
[02:18:26.661 --> 02:18:29.965]  Now people say, well, why'd you come out with these if you have knockout?
[02:18:31.954 --> 02:18:33.615]  Well, because it's different formulas for different people.
[02:18:33.655 --> 02:18:38.799]  Knockout is eight small doses of different natural things that help you sleep well.
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.683]  We came out with stuff even stronger for those that want things that are even stronger.
[02:18:45.043 --> 02:18:52.188]  Take Rocket Rest, that is close to selling out, but I'm going to keep it at 40% off until it does sell out, because it'll be a lost leader.
[02:18:52.208 --> 02:18:55.070]  Even though we sell a lot of it, people are going to want to reorder it after they get it.
[02:18:56.525 --> 02:18:57.465]  It's that good.
[02:18:58.026 --> 02:18:58.786]  What does it have in it?
[02:18:58.866 --> 02:19:10.391]  Well, it has L-theanine, that's the stuff in turkey makes you sleep, gamma amino butyric acid, 5-HTP, and then melatonin, 5 milligrams.
[02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:16.894]  So it's got 5 milligrams of melatonin, 50 milligrams of 5-HTP, 125 milligrams of
[02:19:17.881 --> 02:19:22.466]  Gamma, amino, butyric acid, and 200 milligrams of L-theanine.
[02:19:22.767 --> 02:19:30.596]  Oh, and I forgot, 105 milligrams of magnesium that just helps you blast off to incredible sleep and then blast off when you wake up.
[02:19:31.727 --> 02:19:32.187]  In the morning.
[02:19:32.247 --> 02:19:36.369]  This is way stronger than knockout, which is still a great formula.
[02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:37.930]  Some of you probably don't want to take this.
[02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:39.450]  Okay, maybe take half a capsule when you do.
[02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:41.451]  And then we have also down and out.
[02:19:41.771 --> 02:19:44.372]  That's a very similar formula, but it's a liquid.
[02:19:44.472 --> 02:19:45.132]  Very, very strong.
[02:19:45.713 --> 02:19:47.934]  It doesn't have the 5-HTP in it, though.
[02:19:48.474 --> 02:19:50.115]  It has instead the valerian route.
[02:19:50.455 --> 02:19:53.916]  So these are three different amazing sleep rest formulas.
[02:19:53.976 --> 02:19:54.436]  Here's the key.
[02:19:54.976 --> 02:19:55.817]  All the studies show
[02:19:56.317 --> 02:20:01.499]  That deep sleep is just as important as essential vitamins and minerals to your immune system.
[02:20:01.739 --> 02:20:09.041]  So during these times especially, get that deep, clear sleep and fund the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com with these amazing natural sleep aids.
[02:20:09.922 --> 02:20:11.422]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:20:12.363 --> 02:20:15.944]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to take over.
[02:20:17.416 --> 02:20:23.019]  And I am going to eat lunch and relax, maybe lay back on the beanbag in my office, rest for an hour.
[02:20:23.039 --> 02:20:31.264]  And then I'm going to charge back and try to give you three, four more hours of hard-hitting research and reports because this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:20:31.924 --> 02:20:36.667]  And I've really been praying to God to have that stillness of the most high that King David had and God's been delivering.
[02:20:37.047 --> 02:20:39.288]  So I'm very, very thankful, very thankful for you as well.
[02:20:41.249 --> 02:20:44.050]  The fact that you're tuned into this transmission means you're awake.
[02:20:44.131 --> 02:20:44.991]  It means you're informed.
[02:20:45.379 --> 02:20:48.731]  It means you're involved and you want to save yourself and your family.
[02:20:49.659 --> 02:20:52.140]  My friends, we're all in this together, but I can tell you this right now.
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:21:02.325]  Get in a survivalist mindset while you still can, and get firearms to protect yourself, water filtration, friends and family you can trust, and storable foods while you still can.

[02:21:18.973 --> 02:21:19.814]  Welcome everybody!
[02:21:20.034 --> 02:21:24.497]  We are live once again on the Summit News Hour, where we're going to be talking about a host of bombshell revelations, specifically about
[02:21:43.553 --> 02:21:52.138]  The social credit score system in China, there was a Times report, a London Times report a couple of days ago, it was behind a paywall.
[02:21:53.038 --> 02:21:59.542]  So most people don't know this information, a very lengthy report which I've distilled into my own article.
[02:22:00.342 --> 02:22:09.888]  But we're going to get into that later on in the show as it pertains to the no-fly list, which of course Nick Fuentes was added to at some point after the
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.183]  Shocking, horrific occupation on January the 6th.
[02:22:14.723 --> 02:22:17.185]  So we're going to get into that later and how it pertains to the West.
[02:22:17.245 --> 02:22:26.312]  How the West is basically mirroring the Chinese social credit score program and how in many, many ways it's even worse and yet we still hear this rhetoric.
[02:22:27.313 --> 02:22:28.734]  Oh my God, isn't this ominous?
[02:22:28.794 --> 02:22:29.615]  Isn't this chilling?
[02:22:30.075 --> 02:22:30.896]  Isn't this terrible?
[02:22:31.336 --> 02:22:33.257]  God forbid this would ever happen over here.
[02:22:33.578 --> 02:22:37.781]  It already is happening and it's happening to a way worse extent.
[02:22:38.837 --> 02:22:41.459]  First though, this went up just about half an hour ago.
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:50.047]  Headline, UK hiring Covid marshals to patrol streets until 2023 despite lockdown restrictions supposedly ending in June.
[02:22:51.889 --> 02:23:04.720]  Why do you think that they're hiring Covid marshals in July it turns out, all these UK government councils, despite the fact that we've been told by our illustrious Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who apparently
[02:23:05.655 --> 02:23:10.716]  It has now emerged thought that lockdowns were mad, in his own words, but went on to impose them anyway.
[02:23:11.476 --> 02:23:16.758]  Why are they hiring government enforcers who, by the way, have no enforcement power whatsoever?
[02:23:16.918 --> 02:23:18.518]  That's the ironic truth about it.
[02:23:19.358 --> 02:23:21.019]  But they are there as tattletales.
[02:23:21.639 --> 02:23:27.120]  They are there to literally peer in the letterboxes of bar owners, of private club owners.
[02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:30.841]  In fact, we had a photo when we covered this back in.
[02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:35.555]  Actually it was earlier this month but we also covered it last year during the first lockdown.
[02:23:36.456 --> 02:23:41.883]  The headline then was pub stars a UK renter mob patrol streets to check if bars are open.
[02:23:43.004 --> 02:23:48.091]  And the top image on that story is literally city inspectors.
[02:23:48.431 --> 02:23:50.574]  They were the precursor to the Covid marshals.
[02:23:51.247 --> 02:24:03.011]  Literally opening people's letterboxes and peering in to check that they're not gathering in crowds, that these private clubs aren't open past what was then the 10pm curfew.
[02:24:03.912 --> 02:24:20.798]  Now an army of these rent-a-mob Stasi officials who actually don't have any power but are there to harass and intimidate people, funded by the government, funded by the taxpayer, are going to come into force once again from July onwards, despite the fact
[02:24:21.363 --> 02:24:33.066]  That we were told we would get our freedom back and all restrictions, social distancing, masks, rules on how many people you can congregate with would be lifted on June 21st.
[02:24:33.627 --> 02:24:48.611]  Just like the vaccine passports which they told us were never going to be introduced in the United Kingdom while they were literally paying millions of pounds to the companies creating them, the government has been caught with its pants down lying once again.
[02:24:50.177 --> 02:25:02.645]  Lying to the effect that telling us that all these restrictions are going to end when all along they are planned to not end, in this case, until the end of 2023 minimum.
[02:25:03.086 --> 02:25:04.987]  You heard Bill Gates a couple of days ago.
[02:25:06.188 --> 02:25:08.009]  Again, this was heralded by the media.
[02:25:08.569 --> 02:25:13.733]  Oh Bill Gates says all the restrictions are going to end and that it's coming to an end, that it's over.
[02:25:14.471 --> 02:25:15.472]  We're on the right track.
[02:25:15.512 --> 02:25:16.713]  There's light at the end of the tunnel.
[02:25:17.133 --> 02:25:18.454]  Yeah, he said at the end of 2022.
[02:25:20.056 --> 02:25:20.616]  Maybe.
[02:25:21.937 --> 02:25:25.800]  So that's a whole summer season where they give you back a scintilla of freedom.
[02:25:26.621 --> 02:25:32.726]  Like it's a privilege that the government can empower itself to allow you to go to a pub to visit your friends.
[02:25:32.746 --> 02:25:36.249]  Where you have to book in advance and hand over all your personal details.
[02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:40.072]  And again, it was Herald and he said by the end of 2022.
[02:25:40.713 --> 02:25:42.354]  So we've got another summer season.
[02:25:43.211 --> 02:25:44.632]  Where we get a few freedoms back.
[02:25:45.032 --> 02:25:46.332]  Then autumn kicks in.
[02:25:46.612 --> 02:25:48.213]  Oh, and it's the third wave.
[02:25:48.253 --> 02:25:49.933]  There's a new mutant strain.
[02:25:50.033 --> 02:25:52.154]  Oh well, we have to lock down once again.
[02:25:52.694 --> 02:25:55.975]  Then we hit the winter, where we start getting the flu deaths.
[02:25:56.355 --> 02:25:58.636]  And oh my god, the flu deaths have disappeared!
[02:25:59.897 --> 02:26:01.637]  What could have possibly happened there?
[02:26:01.697 --> 02:26:03.658]  Could they be counting flu deaths as COVID deaths?
[02:26:04.378 --> 02:26:08.279]  As part of this fear-mongering campaign to justify yet another lockdown.
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:09.720]  So you get that in winter.
[02:26:11.368 --> 02:26:14.371]  This is winter 2021 going into 2022.
[02:26:15.152 --> 02:26:16.313]  Comes to spring, summer.
[02:26:16.673 --> 02:26:18.555]  Oh, this is the final lockdown.
[02:26:18.575 --> 02:26:20.216]  You can seriously trust us now.
[02:26:21.057 --> 02:26:28.965]  Again, a few months of relative freedoms, but still with all this Karen-enforced Covid marshal mask wearing and social distancing.
[02:26:30.066 --> 02:26:31.307]  And then we get to the winter again.
[02:26:31.327 --> 02:26:33.169]  Oh, we got a lockdown again.
[02:26:33.509 --> 02:26:35.551]  That was what Bill Gates said at the end of 2022.
[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:41.583]  Which is in over 18 months time and everyone said, oh finally it's ending.
[02:26:42.543 --> 02:26:46.186]  He didn't say it was ending, he said the end of next year, maybe.
[02:26:46.426 --> 02:26:47.367]  That's not an end.
[02:26:47.787 --> 02:26:56.073]  That's more time between now and then, where it's not going to end, than there was between now and the start of the first lockdown.
[02:26:56.333 --> 02:26:59.155]  The timetable is complete BS.
[02:27:00.015 --> 02:27:06.740]  And it's never going to end until enough people start resisting it and not following these ridiculous mandates.
[02:27:08.459 --> 02:27:11.380]  So the UK is hiring Covid marshals to patrol streets until 2023.
[02:27:12.481 --> 02:27:25.427]  The Telegraph reports, quote, A new army of Covid marshals is being recruited for roles that could last until 2023 despite government plans to lift all remaining restrictions on June 21st.
[02:27:25.927 --> 02:27:27.948]  Oh my God, they lied to us again!
[02:27:28.569 --> 02:27:30.049]  How could we have seen this coming?
[02:27:30.470 --> 02:27:35.412]  It literally hasn't happened three distinct separate times in the past 12 months, has it?
[02:27:37.728 --> 02:27:46.895]  And I even see so-called libertarians on Twitter saying, oh, the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong.
[02:27:47.595 --> 02:27:52.539]  Just because you have to go to a pub and you can only sit outside for a few more weeks, why are you complaining?
[02:27:52.599 --> 02:27:53.560]  It's coming to an end.
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:54.901]  No, it isn't.
[02:27:56.002 --> 02:28:02.947]  They said three weeks to flatten the curve back in March last year, 13 months ago.
[02:28:04.328 --> 02:28:06.930]  And we're still here in semi-lockdown.
[02:28:07.859 --> 02:28:22.167]  Hertfordshire County Council is offering a contract of up to £3 million to firms that can supply 60 marshals from July 1st, after the restrictions are supposed to end, until January 31st next year.
[02:28:23.068 --> 02:28:32.553]  And then the contract comes with a possible one-year extension, so it means them patrolling the streets, peering into letterboxes, screeching at people for not wearing masks properly,
[02:28:33.556 --> 02:28:41.658]  Until 2023, and then, oh my God, maybe there's a new mutant strain, maybe there's a new pandemic, maybe there's a bad flu season.
[02:28:42.439 --> 02:28:44.659]  Oh, and it worked so well in the past, didn't it?
[02:28:44.999 --> 02:28:54.342]  With these mask mandates, which, by the way, when they were lifted in South Dakota, when they were lifted in Texas, the cases plummeted, the deaths plummeted.
[02:28:55.499 --> 02:29:06.063]  Absolutely zero evidence that these masks have any effect on stopping the spread of the virus and I'm going to get into peer-reviewed scientific data on that later in the show.
[02:29:06.483 --> 02:29:18.088]  University academic studies which are buried by the media once they come out because of course we had Tucker Carlson yesterday again being savaged by the witch hunt mob
[02:29:18.979 --> 02:29:37.666]  For daring to suggest that after a year of screeching, raging Karens, harassing and intimidating Americans on the streets for not wearing masks, that maybe that should be turned around and maybe the people wearing masks should be mocked on the streets.
[02:29:38.626 --> 02:29:47.189]  And maybe parents who let their kids, who make their kids wear masks, despite the fact that the risk is infinitesimal to the point of non-existent,
[02:29:48.163 --> 02:30:02.891]  Maybe they should face some confrontations, like conservatives, like freedom lovers, have not only been confronted, but intimidated, harassed, abused, doxxed on social media for not wearing masks.
[02:30:02.991 --> 02:30:04.312]  But we're going to get into that later.
[02:30:04.332 --> 02:30:11.976]  They're going to have COVID marshals beyond the date of the restrictions supposedly being lifted.
[02:30:12.734 --> 02:30:18.376]  Then we have this article again out the Telegraph, five reasons why June 21st won't be the return to normal we thought.
[02:30:19.177 --> 02:30:34.103]  And it points out the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which again is due to take place due to start after we were told all restrictions would be lifted, is going to be at 25% capacity, once again proving the timetable is complete BS.
[02:30:34.963 --> 02:30:41.586]  The FA Cup football final is being held again with reduced attendance
[02:30:42.375 --> 02:30:43.975]  These restrictions aren't being lifted.
[02:30:44.075 --> 02:31:02.420]  And again, unless people really start to stand up, unless the tables are turned and those who wear masks outside, even when they're exercising, even when they can put themselves literally at risk of breathing difficulties and coughing fits while doing strenuous exercise, I still see people wearing them in the park when they're literally running.
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:06.501]  It's madcap, insane behaviour and it has to end.
[02:31:06.581 --> 02:31:07.761]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:31:07.941 --> 02:31:08.381]  Don't go away.
[02:31:09.542 --> 02:31:31.862]  And we are back, and we are being told once again that these lockdown measures are not ending, given that the government in the UK is hiring these pub-starzy Covid marshals to patrol the streets, to scream at people for not wearing their masks properly, to scream at them for not social distancing, and to scream at them
[02:31:32.799 --> 02:32:00.511]  For failing or refusing to follow these orders which we are told will all cease to exist on June 21st, and yet everything the government does suggests that that is not happening, the exact same way they said the vaccine passports would never be introduced, now they're introducing them, having funded companies for the past six months to the tune of millions of pounds to create the very vaccine passports they assured us would never exist.
[02:32:02.136 --> 02:32:04.897]  Meanwhile, Sputnik reports let COVID rip.
[02:32:04.937 --> 02:32:08.759]  Boris Johnson reportedly warned there's no evidence mad lockdowns work.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:18.284]  On Monday, Boris Johnson denied that he had ever made remarks about letting bodies pile high in their thousands in the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:32:18.644 --> 02:32:22.105]  Which, to be fair to him, does seem like a completely made-up quote.
[02:32:22.726 --> 02:32:27.488]  The kind of quote that they would attribute to Donald Trump and then it later turned out it was completely made up.
[02:32:29.133 --> 02:32:42.916]  But the Times has cited unnamed sources as saying that during a UK government debate in September 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described COVID-19 lockdowns as, quote, mad, expressing concerns about the economic consequences of such measures.
[02:32:43.636 --> 02:32:52.899]  The sources claimed he told his aides at the time that there was no evidence lockdowns worked and that he would rather let the coronavirus pandemic rip than impose a second lockdown in the country.
[02:32:54.119 --> 02:32:57.700]  So he said this, apparently to his aides back in September 2020,
[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:03.764]  The reports were that he had these same thoughts back before the first lockdown last year.
[02:33:03.784 --> 02:33:14.993]  Yeah, he went on to impose the first lockdown last year, and he went on to impose a second lockdown after September 2020, and then a third lockdown in January 2021.
[02:33:16.655 --> 02:33:24.101]  So he opposed all these lockdowns apparently, thought they were mad, thought they were insane, thought they were stupid, and yet imposed them anyway.
[02:33:25.236 --> 02:33:29.118]  Because it's not like he's the Prime Minister of the country or anything, is it?
[02:33:29.138 --> 02:33:34.740]  It's not like he's literally got the power to do as he sees fit in the interests of the country.
[02:33:36.521 --> 02:33:37.862]  Well, yes, he has that power.
[02:33:37.902 --> 02:33:51.148]  He is the Prime Minister, he is the leader of the country, but he was steamrolled into locking down the country based on the advice, which again has been proven spectacularly wrong by these sage government scientific bureaucrats.
[02:33:52.307 --> 02:34:02.474]  Which, by the way, if you look at the graph of deaths and cases in terms of COVID, in the UK, you see before each lockdown, the cases were already going down.
[02:34:03.394 --> 02:34:11.140]  Then you can transpose a graph of Sweden's cases and deaths, and you see the exact same lines being followed on the graph.
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:17.784]  In fact, Sweden had a lower death rate in comparison to many other, in fact, most other European countries.
[02:34:18.832 --> 02:34:20.913]  Sweden never locked down once.
[02:34:20.973 --> 02:34:30.539]  So these declines in cases, these declines in deaths, were happening before these lockdowns were introduced, proving once again that the lockdowns didn't cause the decline in cases.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:40.985]  Meanwhile, a couple of Fox News clips which have sent the witch hunt mobs absolutely mad on Twitter over the past 24 hours.
[02:34:41.105 --> 02:34:47.109]  Of course, Rose McGowan went on Fox News to say that Dems are in a cult, this is out of RT,
[02:34:48.371 --> 02:34:52.555]  And fury erupts as they miss the part where she says GOP are cultists too.
[02:34:53.856 --> 02:35:00.182]  No-nonsense activist Rose McGowan managed to infuriate Democratic true believers by going on Fox News and saying that they were in a cult.
[02:35:00.603 --> 02:35:13.415]  We're not going to play that clip because we don't have time for it, but we're going to play a similar clip with Tucker Carlson later that same evening also making the point that the Democrats are in a mask cult.
[02:35:14.124 --> 02:35:18.567]  Here's the clip from Tucker last night which absolutely enraged the witch hunt mob.
[02:35:18.707 --> 02:35:19.267]  Let's roll it.
[02:35:20.848 --> 02:35:23.650]  Masks prevent intimacy and human contact.
[02:35:24.050 --> 02:35:26.432]  If I can't see your face, I can't know you.
[02:35:27.212 --> 02:35:28.433]  Masks are for the guilty.
[02:35:28.773 --> 02:35:30.775]  They're signifiers of shame and submission.
[02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:34.857]  Until recently, many jurisdictions had laws against wearing masks in public.
[02:35:35.118 --> 02:35:37.399]  Only Klansmen and armed robbers wore masks.
[02:35:37.819 --> 02:35:38.940]  The rest of us showed our face.
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:39.861]  We were free people.
[02:35:40.902 --> 02:35:49.227]  But then we gave in to the demands of people like Eric Garcetti, and because we did give in, this grotesque version of Halloween went on for more than a year, and it's still going on.
[02:35:50.408 --> 02:35:54.410]  Not even Tony Fauci still pretends that masks are medically necessary.
[02:35:55.030 --> 02:36:00.113]  Instead, masks are purely a sign of political obedience, like Kim Il-sung pins in Pyongyang.
[02:36:00.733 --> 02:36:02.094]  We wear them because we have to.
[02:36:02.655 --> 02:36:06.617]  The only people who wear masks voluntarily outside are zealots and neurotics.
[02:36:07.137 --> 02:36:07.938]  How neurotic are they?
[02:36:08.658 --> 02:36:09.119]  Well, we know.
[02:36:09.779 --> 02:36:19.930]  A Pew survey from last March found that 64% of white Americans who classify themselves as liberal or very liberal have been diagnosed with an actual mental health condition.
[02:36:20.691 --> 02:36:23.554]  And you see them everywhere when you walk down the street in any major city.
[02:36:24.234 --> 02:36:28.759]  If you dare to go on foot from Union Station to the Capitol, for example, in Washington without wearing a mask,
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:32.101]  Angry Biden voters will snort at you in judgment.
[02:36:32.161 --> 02:36:32.962]  How could you?
[02:36:33.182 --> 02:36:34.502]  They're saying from behind the gauze.
[02:36:35.163 --> 02:36:35.883]  How could you?
[02:36:36.363 --> 02:36:39.144]  That's the question we should be asking of them in return.
[02:36:39.745 --> 02:36:41.765]  The rest of us should be snorting at them first.
[02:36:41.885 --> 02:36:42.826]  They're the aggressors.
[02:36:43.146 --> 02:36:46.808]  It's our job to brush them back and restore the society we were born in.
[02:36:47.688 --> 02:36:51.610]  So the next time you see someone in a mask on the sidewalk or on the bike path, do not hesitate.
[02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:53.491]  Ask politely but firmly.
[02:36:53.711 --> 02:36:55.211]  Would you please take off your mask?
[02:36:55.832 --> 02:36:58.193]  Science shows there is no reason for you to be wearing it.
[02:36:58.513 --> 02:37:00.794]  Your mask is making me uncomfortable.
[02:37:01.994 --> 02:37:09.117]  We should do that and we should keep doing it until wearing a mask outside is roughly as socially accepted as lighting a marble on an elevator.
[02:37:09.778 --> 02:37:10.738]  It's repulsive.
[02:37:10.818 --> 02:37:12.139]  Don't do it around other people.
[02:37:12.759 --> 02:37:14.420]  That's the message we should send because it's true.
[02:37:15.638 --> 02:37:18.459]  As for forcing children to wear masks outside, that should be illegal.
[02:37:19.159 --> 02:37:25.820]  Your response when you see children wearing masks as they play should be no different from your response to seeing someone beat a kid in Walmart.
[02:37:26.221 --> 02:37:27.561]  Call the police immediately.
[02:37:27.881 --> 02:37:29.441]  Contact Child Protective Services.
[02:37:29.821 --> 02:37:31.262]  Keep calling until someone arrives.
[02:37:32.022 --> 02:37:33.702]  What you're looking at is abuse.
[02:37:33.742 --> 02:37:37.343]  It's child abuse, and you are morally obligated to attempt to prevent it.
[02:37:38.063 --> 02:37:40.144]  If it's your own children being abused, then
[02:37:45.430 --> 02:37:49.432]  They have Tucker Carlson calling out people who wear masks outside.
[02:37:49.492 --> 02:37:51.173]  There's absolutely no evidence.
[02:37:51.193 --> 02:37:58.797]  Oh, and by the way, the response to this clip on Twitter within hours was, Tucker Carlson is a national security threat.
[02:37:59.357 --> 02:38:07.221]  And then the very next day, the CDC itself comes out and says, fully vaccinated Americans can go outside without a mask.
[02:38:07.721 --> 02:38:09.262]  And indeed, in many cases,
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:10.940]  God forbid!
[02:38:11.301 --> 02:38:26.689]  Non-vaccinated Americans in many situations can also go outside without a mask because the mask outside, and I would argue inside, and I'm going to get into that evidence after the break, has no impact on stopping the spread of coronavirus.
[02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:29.791]  It's a completely insane, unnecessary measure.
[02:38:30.091 --> 02:38:35.534]  Then he makes the point about parents forcing children to wear their masks is a form of child abuse.
[02:38:36.161 --> 02:38:37.501]  What's the data behind that?
[02:38:37.581 --> 02:38:41.522]  Does it back up Tucker Carlson that there's absolutely no reason to mask up your kids?
[02:38:41.922 --> 02:38:46.943]  Well the BBC reported back in August coronavirus reassuring study of children's tiny risk.
[02:38:47.924 --> 02:38:58.506]  There have been no deaths whatsoever of healthy children with no comorbidities in the entire country from coronavirus.
[02:38:59.582 --> 02:39:07.408]  It says parents should be reassured COVID-19 has not caused the deaths of any otherwise healthy school children in the United Kingdom.
[02:39:07.709 --> 02:39:11.252]  And yet, still to this day, we are seeing kids masked up.
[02:39:11.672 --> 02:39:20.139]  I saw kids the other day in the park, in the outside, masked up, lined up like slaves being trained for a gulag.
[02:39:20.619 --> 02:39:27.325]  And again, you look at the actual data, zero deaths of healthy children from coronavirus in the United Kingdom.
[02:39:28.055 --> 02:39:31.096]  A pattern that is very much mirrored across the rest of the world.
[02:39:31.496 --> 02:39:40.300]  While the CDC, the day after Tucker Carlson making these statements, apparently made him a national security threat, basically said the same thing.
[02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:42.601]  Wearing masks outside is pointless.
[02:39:42.661 --> 02:39:44.101]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[02:39:44.981 --> 02:39:54.265]  So as Tucker Carlson rightly pointed out, and he was called a national security threat for doing so, the mask, the face mask, the way it's enforced,
[02:39:55.066 --> 02:40:00.728]  It's completely pointless from a medical standpoint and it's a tool of population control.
[02:40:01.148 --> 02:40:06.010]  It's a symbol of genuflecting, grovelling obedience.
[02:40:07.111 --> 02:40:14.814]  And it facilitates the harassment, the abuse, the doxing of people who realise all this and who refuse to wear one.
[02:40:16.775 --> 02:40:18.315]  Now let me state this very clearly.
[02:40:18.795 --> 02:40:22.977]  The virus particle, the coronavirus, COVID-19 virus particle,
[02:40:24.059 --> 02:40:30.485]  is 1,000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the face mask.
[02:40:30.525 --> 02:40:31.306]  I'll say that again.
[02:40:31.826 --> 02:40:39.553]  The COVID-19 virus particle is 1,000 times smaller than the gap in the fabric of the mask.
[02:40:40.414 --> 02:40:42.676]  Oh my God, how dare he say it!
[02:40:42.776 --> 02:40:44.737]  A dangerous conspiracy theory!
[02:40:45.078 --> 02:40:46.419]  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:40:46.839 --> 02:40:50.402]  No, this is a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[02:40:50.863 --> 02:40:50.943]  Oh!
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:58.103]  This is from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health.
[02:40:58.884 --> 02:41:02.406]  NCBI.NLM.GOV.
[02:41:03.887 --> 02:41:09.871]  The title of this study is Face Masks in the COVID-19 Era, a Health Hypothesis.
[02:41:10.712 --> 02:41:20.438]  The author of this study is Veteran Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System, Cardiology Division, Stanford University.
[02:41:20.718 --> 02:41:21.859]  Let me read the abstract.
[02:41:22.896 --> 02:41:26.437]  Again, this is not David Icke conspiracy theories.
[02:41:26.457 --> 02:41:28.778]  This is not dangerous medical misinformation.
[02:41:28.818 --> 02:41:30.278]  This is a peer-reviewed study.
[02:41:31.199 --> 02:41:41.162]  Many countries across the globe utilize medical and non-medical face masks as non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing the transmission and infectivity of coronavirus disease 2019.
[02:41:42.947 --> 02:41:50.971]  Although scientific evidence supporting face masks efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established.
[02:41:51.051 --> 02:41:53.292]  I'm going to get into those in a short time.
[02:41:54.313 --> 02:42:01.557]  It has been hypothesized that face masks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use.
[02:42:02.457 --> 02:42:09.621]  And then if you go down and read the efficacy of face masks section of this peer-reviewed study, there you see
[02:42:10.219 --> 02:42:13.081]  Children burning face masks, what a terrible sight that was!
[02:42:13.881 --> 02:42:15.762]  It wasn't based and red-pilled at all.
[02:42:16.463 --> 02:42:18.324]  It says efficacy of face masks.
[02:42:18.864 --> 02:42:21.226]  Again, Stanford University peer-reviewed study.
[02:42:21.906 --> 02:42:31.552]  The physical properties of medical and non-medical face masks suggest that face masks are ineffective to block viral particles due to their difference in scales.
[02:42:32.112 --> 02:42:33.273]  According to the current knowledge,
[02:42:34.289 --> 02:42:40.911]  The virus SARS-CoV-19 has a diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm.
[02:42:41.171 --> 02:42:43.192]  Nm stands for nanometers.
[02:42:43.332 --> 02:42:44.892]  That's a billionth of a meter.
[02:42:45.652 --> 02:42:46.973]  Very small particle!
[02:42:49.153 --> 02:42:53.115]  While medical and non-medical face masks thread diameter ranges from 55 um
[02:42:55.686 --> 02:43:02.552]  to 100 to, sorry, 440 UM, that's micrometers, one millionth of a meter.
[02:43:02.812 --> 02:43:04.874]  Not one billionth, one millionth of a meter.
[02:43:05.615 --> 02:43:09.038]  Which is more than 1,000 times larger.
[02:43:10.759 --> 02:43:17.465]  Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter, the virus particle, and face mask thread diameter,
[02:43:18.382 --> 02:43:22.144]  The virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[02:43:22.204 --> 02:43:23.745]  Let me repeat that for you again.
[02:43:24.025 --> 02:43:27.007]  The virus is 1,000 times smaller.
[02:43:28.728 --> 02:43:33.430]  COVID-19 can easily pass through any face mask.
[02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:39.513]  Not my words, the words of a peer-reviewed study from Stanford University.
[02:43:39.773 --> 02:43:41.474]  Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
[02:43:43.736 --> 02:43:44.536]  Here's another one.
[02:43:45.979 --> 02:43:47.761]  And this was a headline out of Natural News.
[02:43:47.841 --> 02:43:50.043]  Oh my God, Natural News, conspiracy theory website.
[02:43:50.083 --> 02:43:53.487]  No, they're talking about a University of Copenhagen study.
[02:43:54.568 --> 02:43:58.632]  Headline, face masks offer no protection from the coronavirus to the people who wear them.
[02:43:59.874 --> 02:44:03.678]  Again, that's not Mike Adams, that's the University of Copenhagen.
[02:44:04.599 --> 02:44:08.603]  A major study in Denmark found that face masks do not protect the people who wear them.
[02:44:09.611 --> 02:44:12.373]  from contracting the Wuhan coronavirus.
[02:44:12.393 --> 02:44:18.559]  However, the researchers do not have enough data to conclude whether face masks can prevent infected people from spreading the disease.
[02:44:19.499 --> 02:44:21.361]  The study was conducted by scientists
[02:44:22.478 --> 02:44:25.960]  Again, it wasn't conducted by David Icke, it was conducted by scientists.
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.361]  Nothing against David Icke, but I'm just making the point.
[02:44:29.181 --> 02:44:33.703]  From the University of Copenhagen, this study is considered the best of its kind so far.
[02:44:33.723 --> 02:44:43.848]  There's only two other significant studies, one in Guinea-Bissau and the other in India, have tried to determine whether there is any statistical evidence that face masks offer protection from the coronavirus.
[02:44:44.988 --> 02:44:51.171]  All three studies showed that masks do not prevent a person from catching the disease.
[02:44:52.125 --> 02:44:56.447]  So you can go and read the University of Copenhagen, you can go and read the Stanford University study.
[02:44:57.787 --> 02:44:59.148]  We also had this headline.
[02:45:00.868 --> 02:45:07.231]  Covid swabs and masks appear to contain hooks and strange fibres that can be inhaled directly into the lungs.
[02:45:07.291 --> 02:45:11.412]  Of course we had this headline out of Summit News in addition to that.
[02:45:12.352 --> 02:45:17.354]  Scientist says plastic pollution is shrinking penises will make most men infertile by 2045.
[02:45:20.009 --> 02:45:22.890]  Now what's covering the coral reefs in the Philippines?
[02:45:23.190 --> 02:45:30.151]  What's adding to the giant plastic ocean hellscape that continues to circulate the globe?
[02:45:30.591 --> 02:45:32.011]  Oh look, it's face masks!
[02:45:32.551 --> 02:45:34.152]  I put out a tweet earlier today.
[02:45:35.512 --> 02:45:42.753]  Literally every 100 meters in the park outside from where I live, there's a face mask dropped on the floor.
[02:45:43.173 --> 02:45:47.994]  If you really care so much about public health and public hygiene,
[02:45:48.547 --> 02:45:54.570]  That you need to wear these face masks outside when there's literally zero evidence that they have any effect.
[02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:59.972]  And you're just doing it to virtue signal and so you can point at other people and harass them for not doing the same.
[02:46:00.732 --> 02:46:06.935]  If you really care about public health and hygiene, why are you dropping the frigging masks on the floor?
[02:46:07.915 --> 02:46:10.957]  Disgusting, gross, dirty behaviour.
[02:46:11.577 --> 02:46:16.299]  Nobody wants to go near those masks, not because of coronavirus in my case, because they're just filthy.
[02:46:17.037 --> 02:46:21.058]  Why are you dropping them on the floor if you care so much about public health?
[02:46:21.338 --> 02:46:22.379]  They're everywhere.
[02:46:23.379 --> 02:46:25.160]  Headline.
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:30.281]  1.5 billion face masks added to plastic ocean hellscape.
[02:46:31.702 --> 02:46:40.664]  Approximately 1.5 billion face masks are expected to be dumped into the sea in just one year according to an environmental group monitoring the level of pollution in the world's oceans.
[02:46:41.125 --> 02:46:42.285]  Nobody cares!
[02:46:43.263 --> 02:46:47.245]  Because friggin' Greta Thunberg hasn't said anything about it.
[02:46:47.725 --> 02:47:11.814]  Oh, but we have to be so worried about a life-giving gas, carbon dioxide, killing the planet, when literally tons and tons of these face masks are now circulating the world's oceans, giving off chemical pollution, giving off toxins that cause the shrinking of penises and infertility in men.
[02:47:12.822 --> 02:47:14.162]  National File reported.
[02:47:15.363 --> 02:47:19.404]  Study chemical that causes penises to shrink found in face masks.
[02:47:20.705 --> 02:47:36.149]  Dr. Shana Swan, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinai Health System, another dangerous conspiracy theorist evidently, has warned in a new book that phthalates, a chemical commonly used in the manufacturing of plastics, can shrink penises and decrease male fertility.
[02:47:36.209 --> 02:47:37.550]  Where do you find those plastics?
[02:47:37.790 --> 02:47:38.750]  In face masks.
[02:47:39.790 --> 02:47:41.211]  Now they're all over the coral reef.
[02:47:42.366 --> 02:47:47.689]  They're part of the giant trash ocean pile which is circulating the globe.
[02:47:48.169 --> 02:47:56.014]  Leftists don't give a damn because Greta Thunberg hasn't got up in front of billionaires at the Davos conference and cried about it.
[02:47:56.254 --> 02:47:57.155]  No one cares!
[02:48:00.817 --> 02:48:05.560]  After the break we're going to get into the social credit score system in China, how it's worse in the West.
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:08.802]  We're also going to get into comments from Joe Rogan about vaccines.
[02:48:09.442 --> 02:48:11.123]  And just to finish up on this point again,
[02:48:12.119 --> 02:48:21.883]  Tucker Carlson being viciously attacked for saying that parents who force their kids to wear pointless face masks as a form of virtue signalling and population control should be confronted.
[02:48:22.303 --> 02:48:25.985]  Again, I go back to the actual statistics which back him up.
[02:48:26.385 --> 02:48:34.369]  Not a single child in the UK has died from coronavirus and that pattern is very much replicated across the rest of the world.
[02:48:34.409 --> 02:48:39.951]  And yet still, not only do I see these masks strewn all over the floor, in the park, in the streets,
[02:48:41.075 --> 02:48:50.925]  They're being worn by children in schools despite the fact there's no actual law which is passed by the government which mandates schools to enforce a mask policy inside classrooms.
[02:48:51.926 --> 02:48:56.410]  But many of these schools decided to enforce the policy on their own anyway.
[02:48:56.430 --> 02:49:01.575]  And I don't have time to get into it here but we have major studies coming out today and yesterday
[02:49:02.722 --> 02:49:17.030]  Showing that not only have kids their language skills decreased rapidly because of being kept away from school, these masks are preventing them from forming interpersonal relationships and they're causing even more young depression.
[02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:18.351]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[02:49:19.491 --> 02:49:29.277]  Well the mob weren't satisfied in their bloodlust when it came to Rose McGowan calling Democrats a cult, when it came to Tucker Carlson calling
[02:49:30.114 --> 02:49:31.516]  Mask Zealots Occult.
[02:49:32.096 --> 02:49:40.045]  No, they wanted one more victim and the next victim apparently of the cancel culture mob is once again Joe Rogan.
[02:49:41.286 --> 02:49:46.071]  Now I'm going to get into some comments about how his show has changed after he moved to Spotify.
[02:49:47.034 --> 02:49:51.238]  But he's in hot water once again, simply for telling the truth.
[02:49:51.778 --> 02:49:52.779]  Same thing every time.
[02:49:52.919 --> 02:50:00.725]  Every time I see somebody, a Rogan, a Carlson, a McGowan, any of these kind of people trending on Twitter, you just know before you click it.
[02:50:01.146 --> 02:50:03.147]  Oh my God, what horrible thing have they said now?
[02:50:03.227 --> 02:50:04.108]  Oh, they've told the truth.
[02:50:05.029 --> 02:50:08.232]  They've told the truth and they're being targeted once again.
[02:50:09.312 --> 02:50:15.918]  And I'm going to get into why, again, this proves that our own social credit system is worse in the West than it is in China.
[02:50:16.581 --> 02:50:24.571]  Well let's go to these comments on vaccinating kids and young healthy people from Joe Rogan on his show yesterday.
[02:50:24.591 --> 02:50:25.232]  Let's hit it.
[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:28.560]  And people say, do you think it's safe to get vaccinated?
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:31.421]  I've said, yeah, I think for the most part it's safe to get vaccinated.
[02:50:31.481 --> 02:50:31.801]  I do.
[02:50:32.301 --> 02:50:32.621]  I do.
[02:50:33.361 --> 02:50:36.862]  But if you're like 21 years old and you say to me, should I get vaccinated?
[02:50:36.922 --> 02:50:37.842]  I go, no.
[02:50:38.782 --> 02:50:39.482]  Are you healthy?
[02:50:40.203 --> 02:50:41.163]  Are you a healthy person?
[02:50:41.423 --> 02:50:45.624]  Like, look, don't do anything stupid, but you should take care of yourself.
[02:50:45.804 --> 02:50:52.925]  If you're a healthy person and you're exercising all the time and you're young and you're eating well, I don't think you need to worry about this.
[02:50:53.425 --> 02:50:54.826]  Yeah, I tend to agree with you.
[02:50:54.966 --> 02:50:58.347]  But there's a lot of jobs that will tell you you need to have this.
[02:50:58.467 --> 02:50:59.827]  Well, that's what's starting to happen now.
[02:50:59.867 --> 02:51:02.108]  People are worried about them doing it for their children.
[02:51:02.268 --> 02:51:06.890]  And we talked about this earlier, that you might have to have your children vaccinated.
[02:51:06.910 --> 02:51:12.332]  And you know, I can tell you as someone whose both my children got the virus, it was nothing.
[02:51:13.143 --> 02:51:17.804]  I mean, I hate to say that, if someone's children died from this, I'm very sorry that that happened.
[02:51:17.864 --> 02:51:20.225]  I'm not in any way diminishing that.
[02:51:20.445 --> 02:51:24.466]  But I'm saying, the personal experience that my children had with COVID was nothing.
[02:51:25.326 --> 02:51:28.047]  One of the kids had a headache, the other one didn't feel good for a couple days.
[02:51:29.247 --> 02:51:32.888]  I mean, not feel good, like, no big deal.
[02:51:32.948 --> 02:51:37.649]  No coughing, no aching, no agony, there was none of that.
[02:51:37.949 --> 02:51:39.169]  It was very mild.
[02:51:39.469 --> 02:51:41.670]  It was akin to them getting a cold.
[02:51:42.210 --> 02:51:51.276]  Yeah, and you can have this thing where it's like you were saying this virtue signaling and this kind of like theatrical display of I get the vaccine, what a good person I am, I care about everyone.
[02:51:51.296 --> 02:51:54.337]  But you're like, look, my daughter's a lot younger than your kids.
[02:51:54.357 --> 02:51:58.520]  But I'm like, yeah, I'm not injecting my daughter with something to virtue signal.
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:51:59.941]  Like, I'm not doing that.
[02:52:00.241 --> 02:52:08.345]  If there's something that she's of no risk, statistically has no risk from, I'm sorry, I'm not taking any experiment on her in that.
[02:52:08.385 --> 02:52:09.945]  And that's my attitude toward it.
[02:52:09.965 --> 02:52:11.586]  But it's amazing that that's controversial.
[02:52:12.026 --> 02:52:17.449]  That even saying that, I'm not going to inject my child with the vaccine, is controversial.
[02:52:17.949 --> 02:52:18.509]  It's crazy.
[02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:24.792]  Because, again, we are not talking about even the flu, that we just found out killed 22,000 people last year.
[02:52:24.812 --> 02:52:25.633]  We're not talking about that.
[02:52:26.193 --> 02:52:27.734]  We're talking about something that is not
[02:52:29.495 --> 02:52:51.951]  Now, first of all, in response to that, I haven't seen a story where a celebrity, or even people that I know personally, having the vaccine and not having some kind of side effect.
[02:52:52.351 --> 02:52:57.215]  Not having awful flu-like symptoms for days, even for over a week on end.
[02:52:57.828 --> 02:52:59.930]  In some cases, people have died, obviously.
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:14.581]  Now, if you want to take that risk to get that vaccine, to protect yourself against a virus, which for most people you literally have a 99.8% chance of surviving, according to the CDC's own numbers, if you want to do that, go ahead.
[02:53:15.462 --> 02:53:20.946]  You'll notice that Rogan there said his two kids got the COVID virus and it was basically nothing.
[02:53:21.986 --> 02:53:23.388]  And I go back to the original point.
[02:53:23.428 --> 02:53:26.390]  The BBC reported in the UK, zero kids
[02:53:26.874 --> 02:53:29.795]  Who were healthy, who got COVID, died from COVID.
[02:53:30.175 --> 02:53:30.676]  Zero.
[02:53:31.276 --> 02:53:32.977]  You know who did die from COVID?
[02:53:34.077 --> 02:53:38.159]  Children with comorbidities, including obesity.
[02:53:38.179 --> 02:53:39.600]  And yet, what now do we see?
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:43.602]  I'm going to go back to Rogan in a second, but I just wanted to intersect with this.
[02:53:44.362 --> 02:53:51.285]  Headline out of Information Liberation, CNN says, here's a list of free stuff you can get if you've been vaxxed.
[02:53:51.966 --> 02:54:06.256]  So now they're literally offering to young people Budweiser beer, free Budweiser beer, free Juniors cheesecake, whatever that is, free Krispy Kreme donuts every day!
[02:54:06.276 --> 02:54:17.905]  It says you can get one free glazed donut every day if you take your vaccination card to any Krispy Kreme location in the US, the company said in a press release.
[02:54:18.585 --> 02:54:20.847]  So they're offering Nathan's hot dogs
[02:54:21.403 --> 02:54:33.972]  Junior's Cheesecake and Krispy Kreme to kids when you have an obesity epidemic in America which has killed children because they got the coronavirus, they had a comorbidity and they died.
[02:54:34.353 --> 02:54:37.735]  And yet their reward for getting the vaccine is to make them fatter.
[02:54:39.336 --> 02:54:40.477]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:54:42.179 --> 02:54:50.705]  Then on the wider point of Rogan's spiel there, which he's getting cancelled for again today, I mean you have to hand it to him to some extent.
[02:54:51.889 --> 02:55:11.818]  It doesn't appear like he's self-censoring in the fear that the episodes will be removed from Spotify, and yet we do know that over a dozen, it was probably two dozen or more episodes, when Rogan switched over from his usual format on YouTube to Spotify, were removed and they were never reinstated.
[02:55:12.378 --> 02:55:14.339]  This one could also get removed.
[02:55:14.359 --> 02:55:14.899]  You know why?
[02:55:15.908 --> 02:55:27.071]  Because on numerous occasions Spotify employees, woke maniacal idiots, have literally staged mutinies in their offices because of something that Joe Rogan said.
[02:55:28.511 --> 02:55:38.074]  So at some point you know that top executive level management is going to break and they're not only going to start removing more Joe Rogan podcast episodes,
[02:55:39.059 --> 02:55:43.223]  They're going to start trying to control what he can say.
[02:55:43.683 --> 02:56:04.822]  And whether he bows to that remains to be seen, but judging from this clip, props to him, he hasn't bowed so far, despite the intense reaction of the hysterical hate mob, which has facilitated itself via Twitter to destroy people's lives, to have them de-platformed, to have their bank accounts removed because of their opinions.
[02:56:04.862 --> 02:56:06.183]  And I'm going to get onto that in a moment.
[02:56:06.781 --> 02:56:09.262]  Funny comment on the thread, though, of this Rogan video.
[02:56:09.282 --> 02:56:23.207]  Somebody said, in reference to the Spotify mutinies, the employees have had three mutinies this morning, then lunch, followed by two more afternoon mutinies, followed by a break, then 5pm time to go home before tomorrow's mutinies.
[02:56:23.547 --> 02:56:26.188]  So expect to see that over the next 24 hours.
[02:56:27.608 --> 02:56:29.849]  But you gotta hand it to him, he's still speaking the truth, right?
[02:56:31.053 --> 02:56:38.535]  Meanwhile, headline, Chai comms hit citizens with 10 point social credit score penalty for not wearing a mask in public.
[02:56:38.575 --> 02:56:52.178]  And again, conservatives all day long, establishment conservatives on social media will call out, will slam China for introducing this onerous, chilling social credit score without ever acknowledging that we have it worse in the West.
[02:56:53.211 --> 02:57:01.798]  Which he saw today with Nick Fuentes literally being put on a no-fly list for his political opinions despite the fact that he's committed no crime.
[02:57:02.738 --> 02:57:07.102]  Despite the fact that he didn't occupy the Capitol building back on January 6.
[02:57:08.283 --> 02:57:10.865]  He's purely being punished for his thoughts.
[02:57:11.645 --> 02:57:14.348]  He engaged in thought crime and he's being punished for it.
[02:57:15.148 --> 02:57:18.611]  We have the social credit score system already in the West and then you see
[02:57:20.336 --> 02:57:44.654]  Again, establishment conservatives on Twitter who can always be relied upon to flake out and flounce when the going gets tough, responding to this story by saying, oh, but it was the airlines who barred Fuentes from flying because he previously had an incident where some screeching Karen flight attendant shouted at him to put his mask over his nose.
[02:57:44.694 --> 02:57:46.555]  He refused and he got off the plane.
[02:57:47.501 --> 02:57:51.183]  So it was the airlines enforcing this no-fly ban on Nick Fuentes.
[02:57:51.223 --> 02:57:53.545]  Well, for a start, that's wrong according to what he said.
[02:57:53.985 --> 02:57:58.428]  It was the TSA directly who enforced the ban, not the airlines.
[02:57:59.808 --> 02:58:02.250]  And then the other point is, oh, it's OK.
[02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:04.271]  It's OK if a private company does it.
[02:58:04.571 --> 02:58:05.312]  No, it's not.
[02:58:05.692 --> 02:58:08.714]  That's the same social credit score system.
[02:58:09.794 --> 02:58:13.677]  And there's a lengthy London Times article on this subject, which I encourage you all to read.
[02:58:14.257 --> 02:58:15.838]  I've done a boiled down summary of it.
[02:58:17.029 --> 02:58:37.857]  It says the communist Chinese government is punishing citizens in some areas of the country who commit COVID-related transgressions such as not wearing a mask in public by deducting 10 points from their social credit score and in some cases putting them on no-fly blacklists, which is exactly what happened to Fuentes, whether you think it's because of his
[02:58:38.692 --> 02:58:50.135]  Being in the capital for a Trump rally on January 6th, God forbid, or because he had an encounter with a Karen flight attendant for not wearing his mask properly, it's the same system here in the West.
[02:58:51.215 --> 02:59:04.018]  And I make the point in the article that we have it worse and that the communist Chinese dictators could only dream of having it as good as the woke mob has it in the West.
[02:59:04.810 --> 02:59:07.612]  Because as we know, these hate groups have weaponised Twitter.
[02:59:07.652 --> 02:59:08.913]  We saw it with Rose McGowan.
[02:59:08.934 --> 02:59:10.135]  We saw it with Tucker Carlson.
[02:59:10.635 --> 02:59:13.357]  We see it with private citizens on a daily basis.
[02:59:13.958 --> 02:59:25.227]  They've weaponised Twitter to facilitate the organised harassment, doxing, deplatforming and all-round life-ruining of Conservatives and anyone who questions the mob's narrative on a daily basis.
[02:59:25.688 --> 02:59:33.054]  So we're supposed to be outraged about China centralising this programme under Covid to punish people, to ban them from flying, taking public transport.
[02:59:33.829 --> 02:59:43.157]  Because they didn't wear a mask, because they criticized lockdown policy, and yet we have it far worse, far more intense, and far more weaponized here in the West.
[02:59:44.177 --> 02:59:44.958]  Summit.News.
[02:59:50.002 --> 02:59:58.008]  I've had major supplement manufacturers come to us and say, Mr. Jones, one of them is actually French,
[02:59:59.119 --> 03:00:09.711]  If you would just give people lower quality supplements, you wouldn't have supply problems and you could charge the same amount but make a bigger profit.
[03:00:10.615 --> 03:00:11.916]  And I'm like, but wait a minute.
[03:00:12.496 --> 03:00:21.383]  I want the highest quality because I want my listeners to get the highest quality because it's some metaphysical level.
[03:00:21.503 --> 03:00:37.194]  I just pick up the mojo that if I say I've got the best vitamin B12, which is ultra 12 or super high quality vitamin D3, which is winter sun, or the most amazing natural 10 hour energy turbo force,
[03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:41.531]  That it better damn well be good and it better damn well work.
[03:00:42.411 --> 03:00:46.812]  I mean, that's not like some gimmick that I just say.
[03:00:47.732 --> 03:00:53.893]  Just like with the information we cover, I don't let their threats or their attacks control what I say because it's electricity.
[03:00:54.814 --> 03:01:01.455]  When I give you my all, you support me and we have victory.
[03:01:02.509 --> 03:01:04.550]  So it isn't some altruistic thing.
[03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:07.552]  Oh, Jones is so liberal or loving.
[03:01:07.592 --> 03:01:09.273]  He's so moral.
[03:01:09.893 --> 03:01:11.014]  No, I'm a crazed berserker.
[03:01:11.594 --> 03:01:15.096]  But I learned very early in life, treat others as you want to be treated.
[03:01:15.116 --> 03:01:15.896]  It's a golden rule.
[03:01:16.456 --> 03:01:18.518]  Well, beyond the golden rule is lay on your life for others.
[03:01:19.038 --> 03:01:19.958]  That's being Christ-like.
[03:01:20.599 --> 03:01:22.220]  I've never quite gotten to that point.
[03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:24.921]  But I do treat others as I want to be treated.
[03:01:25.081 --> 03:01:27.983]  And I thank you so much for supporting us over the years.
[03:01:29.003 --> 03:01:30.144]  Man, we need funding.
[03:01:30.584 --> 03:01:36.788]  We've got so many projects we can launch if you just support us and we've got products that are incredible.
[03:01:37.569 --> 03:01:38.490]  I could sell you
[03:01:40.211 --> 03:01:59.095]  Male enhancement stuff for one third of the price it's costing me and it would still give you somewhat of a good effect but I go get the organic highest grade we can and then I stay on those manufacturers and I stay on them with the testing and then sometimes they screw us over and don't give us the best batch.
[03:01:59.295 --> 03:02:04.796]  I mean I'm gonna be completely honest even though I'm shooting for the stars sometimes we only make the mountains.
[03:02:06.049 --> 03:02:08.370]  But we're not down the valleys on purpose trying to screw you over.
[03:02:08.770 --> 03:02:11.151]  Like some badges of knockout will be super frickin' strong.
[03:02:11.492 --> 03:02:13.152]  Other ones are like, this isn't as strong as that.
[03:02:13.553 --> 03:02:16.054]  That's the way organic, wild source stuff works.
[03:02:17.555 --> 03:02:18.995]  It's not some chemical we're giving you.
[03:02:19.015 --> 03:02:21.416]  That's why everybody does chemicals, because they can tell.
[03:02:21.456 --> 03:02:24.658]  It's cheap, it's ready, it's a chemical, it manipulates something in your brain.
[03:02:25.018 --> 03:02:27.479]  It's not natural, so it has a lot of side effects.
[03:02:27.539 --> 03:02:28.100]  We don't do that.
[03:02:29.309 --> 03:02:34.612]  So when I tell you Alva Power is amazing, it's the same herbs that are in Super Mel Vitality, that's just cold-pressed.
[03:02:35.372 --> 03:02:36.533]  This is dry herbs.
[03:02:36.673 --> 03:02:37.253]  It works great.
[03:02:37.273 --> 03:02:37.834]  It's very strong.
[03:02:37.874 --> 03:02:38.334]  It's amazing.
[03:02:38.774 --> 03:02:40.335]  Male libido, stamina, energy.
[03:02:40.395 --> 03:02:41.155]  Women love it as well.
[03:02:41.195 --> 03:02:41.816]  It's back in stock.
[03:02:41.836 --> 03:02:42.816]  40% off.
[03:02:42.856 --> 03:02:44.017]  Prostagard, everybody knows about.
[03:02:44.037 --> 03:02:44.637]  Salt Palmetto.
[03:02:44.917 --> 03:02:45.698]  But it's not just for men.
[03:02:45.738 --> 03:02:46.638]  It's great for women as well.
[03:02:47.159 --> 03:02:50.520]  And it's got all these different multivitamins and things in it that are excellent as well.
[03:02:50.901 --> 03:02:54.743]  Winter Sun, super high-end vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system.
[03:02:54.783 --> 03:02:55.543]  It's back in stock.
[03:02:56.083 --> 03:02:58.545]  Pure Turmeric Liquid Extract is about to sell out.
[03:02:59.687 --> 03:03:00.868]  We won't get more for 12 weeks.
[03:03:00.888 --> 03:03:01.789]  We just put the new order in.
[03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:04.812]  But I gotta sell it at sale so you'll buy it.
[03:03:05.232 --> 03:03:06.773]  So it's on sale, 40% off.
[03:03:06.913 --> 03:03:10.416]  It'll be sold out for months after it sells out in just a few weeks.
[03:03:11.477 --> 03:03:12.298]  And so much more.
[03:03:12.358 --> 03:03:15.461]  All t-shirts are $17.76 in game.
[03:03:15.821 --> 03:03:18.183]  It's as low as $3.95 apiece to expose what's going on.
[03:03:18.584 --> 03:03:20.625]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:03:42.663 --> 03:03:43.804]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:03:43.844 --> 03:03:45.866]  We're going to win this thing if we up our game.
[03:03:49.753 --> 03:04:01.008]  For the last four years, while the Chai Com-backed big tech has been censoring and blackballing and deplatforming conservatives, nationalists and Christians, we've heard over and over again, oh, just build your own internet.
[03:04:01.569 --> 03:04:04.433]  But everybody that tries to build their own social media,
[03:04:04.933 --> 03:04:09.957]  That tries to build their own websites, that tries to build their own radio or TV networks, gets savagely attacked.
[03:04:10.458 --> 03:04:13.621]  In fact, if your network is successful, that's when they really come after you.
[03:04:13.661 --> 03:04:14.501]  This is predatory.
[03:04:14.982 --> 03:04:16.423]  This is martial law.
[03:04:16.503 --> 03:04:18.244]  This is information warfare.
[03:04:18.945 --> 03:04:21.988]  InfoWars is one of the only platforms still on air.
[03:04:22.588 --> 03:04:28.073]  We have an electronic Berlin Wall of tyranny and censorship and de-platforming descending everywhere.
[03:04:28.593 --> 03:04:29.854]  There's only a few people left.
[03:04:30.235 --> 03:04:31.095]  Rush Limbaugh's dead.
[03:04:31.175 --> 03:04:32.817]  Tucker Carlson's barely hanging on.
[03:04:33.342 --> 03:04:36.284]  But InfoWars is as strong as ever thanks to you.
[03:04:36.744 --> 03:04:41.587]  But I want to talk about something that doesn't just empower InfoWars, but empowers everyone together.
[03:04:42.047 --> 03:04:44.609]  And that's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:04:44.789 --> 03:04:46.450]  That's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:04:47.310 --> 03:04:58.977]  That link takes you right to Epic, the only major domain registrar that's been around for a long time that does not censor individuals because of their political or spiritual content.
[03:04:59.707 --> 03:05:02.449]  That's why you need to go to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:05:02.810 --> 03:05:09.755]  If you have domains that you've registered with GoDaddy or others, and move them there to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[03:05:10.116 --> 03:05:12.097]  If you go directly to Epic, they're awesome.
[03:05:12.117 --> 03:05:13.158]  They have servers.
[03:05:13.899 --> 03:05:15.680]  They have all sorts of other internet services.
[03:05:15.921 --> 03:05:17.642]  They basically have everything you need
[03:05:18.138 --> 03:05:22.262]  And they are expanding because there is that need because of all the censorship and control.
[03:05:22.482 --> 03:05:25.985]  So they're building that free internet infrastructure that didn't exist.
[03:05:26.445 --> 03:05:38.295]  But when you go to InfoWarsDomains.com, it sends a link to them so that we get 25% of the sign-up and we get 5% of any server services or other things you get.
[03:05:38.575 --> 03:05:40.717]  So it's a win-win for everybody and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:05:40.977 --> 03:05:42.118]  It protects your domains.
[03:05:42.298 --> 03:05:43.499]  It helps you build your website.
[03:05:44.019 --> 03:05:46.942]  Whatever you do, go to InfoWarsDomains.com today and check it out.
