[00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:05.367]  We've been working on this story for over a week, and we were set to break it tomorrow.
[00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:14.154]  But we were very excited and pleased to see that Mike Adams, the health ranger, broke it, because his scientific background and research is even better than ours.
[00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:16.696]  He did a great job laying it all out.
[00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:26.523]  The headline is, Bombshell Connecticut Government Secretly Tells Healthcare Workers COVID Vaccines Are Deadly, But Withholds the Same Information from the Public.
[00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:29.105]  The first half of the article is about that.
[00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:30.385]  It's very important.
[00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:37.788]  The part that we were working on is the second part of the article, and quite frankly, I think is the most important part.
[00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:49.313]  And that is, COVID-19 vaccine ingredients include SM-102, a toxic substance known to be harmful to humans and animals.
[00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:53.915]  Now, it's not just the main ingredient in antifreeze.
[00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.551]  We did research on this.
[00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.814]  SM-102 is a catchphrase for an entire class of toxic oils.
[00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:18.883]  And in their own internal document that is from the health department to health department workers, this isn't given to the public, and Connecticut confirms this is a real document, they have the data safety sheet on this that I'm about to read to you now.
[00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:22.465]  The article we just mentioned is at naturalnews.com.
[00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:23.626]  We'll also post it
[00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:34.106]  Here on Wednesday underneath the live show feed so that you can actually go see this for yourself as well and then hopefully share it.
[00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.688]  But whatever you do, go research this for yourself.
[00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.131]  Look this up for yourself.
[00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:43.395]  Let me go ahead and show you on screen some close shots.
[00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:46.467]  of this, again, for yourself.
[00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:50.630]  This document is on the Connecticut website, but it was not widely distributed.
[00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.594]  They may try to take it down, so for those purposes we have mirrored it on Infowars.com.
[00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.636]  It's also mirrored on NaturalNews.com.
[00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:08.463]  So it goes into telling you that it's safe, and it's fine, and it's something you really need to do, but then they have the safety data sheet
[00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:10.654]  That is connected to it.
[00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:16.275]  This is what the health department there in Connecticut, you better believe your health department is also aware of.
[00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:16.995]  This is another reason.
[00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:30.298]  Roughly half the healthcare workers, the scientists, the researchers at the NIH and CDC, thousands testified in Congress last week have not taken the vaccine, even though they were the first to have it available to them because they know it's experimental.
[00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:31.698]  It's not really a vaccine.
[00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.059]  Trade name SM-102.
[00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:39.364]  And again, it has a very, very long, complex name that we've got on screen for you.
[00:02:39.444 --> 00:02:45.809]  It's article number, so you can look it up for yourself, is 33474.
[00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.809]  33474.
[00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:57.978]  Let's start at the very top of the safety data sheet, where it says it is for research purposes only, and not to be used on humans.
[00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:01.240]  Right out of the gates, right there in the document.
[00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.305]  And let's go ahead and read over what this thing does.
[00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:06.865]  Suspected of causing cancer.
[00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:10.686]  Suspected of damaging fertility and the unborn child.
[00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:18.507]  Causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the liver, and the respiratory system through prolonged or repeated exposure.
[00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:29.730]  And I want you to take two shots of this and then recurring booster shots mixed in with other things the body is creating an immunity to, which a lot of scientists say will then create an autoimmune response to this chemical.
[00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.450]  So very, very serious.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.002]  Hazard Determining Components of Labeling.
[00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:52.775]  And then it goes on to say that it's highly toxic, fatal in contact with skin, causes skin irritation, causes serious eye irritation, suspected of damaging fertility of the unborn child, causes damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, liver, respiratory system through prolonged, repeated exposure.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.261]  Harmful to aquatic life.
[00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.623]  Very toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects.
[00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:00.924]  Obtain special instructions before use.
[00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.186]  Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood.
[00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:10.048]  They don't tell you this when you go get to Walgreens or when you go to Walmart or you go to CVS.
[00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.731]  Keep container tightly closed and it just goes on from there.
[00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.692]  Do not breathe.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.261]  Do not get it in your eyes or skin or clothing.
[00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:22.643]  Wash thoroughly after handling.
[00:04:22.723 --> 00:04:26.364]  Do not eat, drink, or smoke when using this product.
[00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:29.586]  Avoid releasing into the environment, much less into people.
[00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:34.068]  Wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection when you do use it.
[00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:38.370]  If swallowed, call a poison center doctor if you feel unwell.
[00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:42.833]  So, folks are getting sick, collapsing, having heart attacks, the rest of it, this is just one reason.
[00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.734]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just the first page.
[00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:47.275]  Okay?
[00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:50.307]  So, again, that's page 1.
[00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:52.489]  It's the first page actually getting into it all.
[00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.910]  I've got page 3.
[00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:57.734]  And I've got page 4.
[00:04:57.994 --> 00:05:07.263]  There's 11 pages of this, and I've only scratched the tip of the iceberg for you on this.
[00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:11.227]  And I'm just continually absolutely stunned.
[00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:12.589]  Oh, and by the way,
[00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:24.542]  They list the other things that are in this vaccine, and two of the others are also dangerous industrial oils that they say in small amounts are extremely toxic.
[00:05:25.463 --> 00:05:34.810]  And that's how they deliver the nanotech-sized RNA into your cells to reprogram them with a spike protein, which your body also has an autoimmune response to.
[00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:40.004]  They're going for broke.
[00:05:40.124 --> 00:05:41.225]  This is totally insane.
[00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:42.846]  It doesn't protect you from COVID.
[00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:48.328]  Most people in the hospital dying from COVID now, they admit are there from COVID vaccines.
[00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:59.353]  Everyone has to get this report and send it out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and then send them a link to this industrial, extremely dangerous chemical, SCM-102.
[00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:04.533]  from the Safety Data Sheet.
[00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:08.617]  There are thousands of copies of the Safety Data Sheet online.
[00:06:09.258 --> 00:06:22.510]  The one that we pulled up in our link to the article is Safety Data Sheet from OSHA HCS and this is out of the Cayman Islands where this particular chemical is being manufactured but it's manufactured other places
[00:06:24.344 --> 00:06:24.764]  As well.
[00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:27.005]  Again, I'm a father.
[00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:28.405]  I'm a human.
[00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:29.306]  I have parents.
[00:06:29.686 --> 00:06:32.747]  I'm watching people all around me get sick and die from the so-called vaccines.
[00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:36.768]  You ask, how are they going to get away with this?
[00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:37.969]  Well, the answer is they're not.
[00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.970]  But they did get away with tens of millions of people being autistic from vaccines.
[00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.671]  And now that was all coming out.
[00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:46.272]  So this was supposed to be an even bigger event.
[00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:53.580]  So we forget the old event, and then there'll be an even bigger event coming in the future, Bill Gates said, where, quote, terrorists release a bioweapon.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:00.443]  And we've also got Bill Gates saying that we need to depopulate the earth at the same time.
[00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:06.486]  So when you've got somebody saying they want to depopulate you, but they really want to put something in your body, you should put two and two together.
[00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:10.788]  Paul Joseph Watson did a big story about Klaus Schwab that heads up the Economic Forum at Davos.
[00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:12.849]  He's Henry Kissinger's frontman.
[00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.912]  And Paul Watson said, why is he so concerned about having more gay characters on TV?
[00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:26.677]  Because only 10% of characters on TV are gay, when only roughly 5% of the world population, quote, identifies as gay, up from 1% a few years ago.
[00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:27.388]  I don't know.
[00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:52.125]  Just on its face, they're doing this.
[00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:54.466]  It's not even a calculation to know they're doing it.
[00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:56.806]  They're telling us it's about depopulation.
[00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:59.287]  And that's why it attacks their fertility.
[00:07:59.568 --> 00:08:01.088]  That's why it attacks the rest of the body.
[00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:09.111]  And that's why it causes us horrible autoimmune disorders as this lipid, this oil, is delivering this through your cell membrane.
[00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:11.892]  So again, we're going to post this to Bandot Video.
[00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:14.813]  Remember, Big Tech is censoring and blocking all this.
[00:08:14.873 --> 00:08:16.074]  They are committing war crimes.
[00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:21.239]  I know Owen has a very special medical doctor joining him today who's also been persecuted and attacked for telling the truth.
[00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:35.611]  Those famous press conferences in front of the U.S.
[00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.052]  Capitol.
[00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:39.132]  And so I'll leave that to Owen to tell you who's coming up.
[00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:41.793]  It's going to be extremely informative and extremely powerful.
[00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:45.173]  But I wanted to kick the main broadcast off the day with this information.
[00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:49.914]  I also just talked to Mike Adams and he's going to be able to pop on the broadcast as well.
[00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:57.756]  And again, he owns a biochemical research laboratory and really is at another level when it comes to understanding all this
[00:08:58.056 --> 00:08:58.417]  Yes, sir!
[00:09:13.773 --> 00:09:15.774]  is involved in a chain reaction.
[00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:22.898]  Everywhere I go I run into listeners and viewers, even when I'm on a vacation, who are aware of what's happening and tell me to keep fighting.
[00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:31.423]  Well, I'm going to keep fighting, but I'm asking them to keep fighting by simply spreading the word about the broadcasting, telling folks the truth lives at Infowars.com.
[00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:32.684]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:55.435]  One of the best selling supplements in the United States and across the world in the last decade is magnesium powders because they work so good.
[00:09:55.855 --> 00:10:03.500]  Because they're critical to all your cells to operating smoothly to your heart, to your brain, to your liver, to everything.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.161]  It's something you can take in the morning and it doesn't make you tired.
[00:10:06.221 --> 00:10:08.543]  It makes you have smooth, clean energy.
[00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:12.825]  Every other nutrient you get is basically boosted by it.
[00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:17.968]  I'm going to go over some of the facts from the fact sheet that scientists have put together here in a moment.
[00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:19.628]  But first I want to just explain something.
[00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.510]  It took us several years to get this developed.
[00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.212]  Because I fund my operations selling products that work and that people want.
[00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:34.476]  And clearly you go to the grocery store, you go anywhere, you see them selling different brands and different forms of magnesium fizzy drinks.
[00:10:35.277 --> 00:10:37.018]  And it's something that when I forget to do it,
[00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.062]  My day isn't as good.
[00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:47.667]  I've been religiously, since this came in a few weeks ago, and now we've got the full shipment as we can sell it, taking it, and it's just made my life so much better.
[00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:52.731]  And it goes great with the X2, it goes great with the Brainforce Plus, it really is amazing.
[00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:59.575]  It's our new Ionic Fizzy Magnesium Orange Flavored Drink Mix from m4slife.com.
[00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:01.457]  Here's the scientific fact sheet.
[00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:05.619]  True Ionic Magnesium for Optimal Absorption.
[00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:06.939]  That is so important.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.780]  The other brands work great.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.162]  Magnesium is amazing, but they have one type of magnesium.
[00:11:13.482 --> 00:11:24.928]  This has two types of magnesium, and then when you add the other things that are in the formula, the scientist explained to us that it creates the very best form of ionized magnesium.
[00:11:25.228 --> 00:11:27.630]  That is absorbed directly into your individual cells.
[00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:28.992]  Here's another important fact.
[00:11:29.352 --> 00:11:35.458]  An estimated 75% of Americans do not meet the recommended amount of magnesium intake every single day.
[00:11:35.738 --> 00:11:41.644]  Magnesium helps regulate the sodium-potassium pumps that create the signals in the nerve cells.
[00:11:42.004 --> 00:11:50.192]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:51.093]  Thank you.
[00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:10.792]  Now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium.
[00:12:11.153 --> 00:12:11.913]  It tastes great.
[00:12:12.473 --> 00:12:13.294]  I take it in the morning.
[00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:14.575]  I take it in the evening.
[00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:19.878]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:22.740]  It's available at mfulmorestore.com right now.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.702]  You can get one canister for $19.95, and the second canister is $14.95.
[00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:31.808]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[00:12:32.068 --> 00:12:36.114]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:40.500]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the Infowar, which is a true 360 win.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.006]  Now exclusively available at InfowarStore.com for only $19.95.
