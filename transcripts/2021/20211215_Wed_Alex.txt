[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.267]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:23.400]  Studies from the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the American Heart Association all indicate that mRNA COVID vaccines are causing cardiovascular diseases.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:36.390]  However, according to the Evening Standard, up to 300,000 people in the United Kingdom are facing heart-related illnesses due to PPSD, post-pandemic stress disorder.
[00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:53.525]  Based on the testimony of two London physicians, Mark Rainer and Tahir Hussain, the sharp rise in cardiovascular cases, especially among 30 to 45 year olds, is due to stress and anxiety caused by living during the COVID pandemic.
[00:00:53.525 --> 00:01:00.631]  And no, the doctors do not blame the media and politicians for hyping up fear amongst their citizens.
[00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:05.475]  Even though that would support their PPSD narrative extremely well.
[00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:14.723]  But why don't the physicians blame the widely administered and experimental mRNA COVID vaccine for the rise in heart-related illnesses?
[00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:29.015]  On November 8th, 2021, the American Heart Association posted in their online journal a warning about the direct correlation between mRNA vaccines and an increased risk in cardiovascular diseases.
[00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:38.527]  Their study concludes that the mRNA vaccines dramatically increase inflammation in the tissue that lines blood vessels and the heart.
[00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:43.935]  The mRNA vaccines also account for the observations of increased thrombosis.
[00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:50.319]  Which occurs when blood clots block veins or arteries and can cause strokes or heart attacks.
[00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.982]  An increase of cardiomyopathy was also observed.
[00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:59.746]  A disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your body to pump blood to the rest of the body.
[00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:20.339]  On November 12, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control published an article titled, Myocarditis and Pericarditis After mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination, which states, quote, Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart.
[00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:28.003]  In both cases, the body's immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger.
[00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:28.984]  Some other trigger?
[00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:35.249]  Clearly, the mRNA vaccine is the trigger to this heart disease, as stated in their own headline.
[00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:47.718]  The CDC even warns that myocarditis and pericarditis is prevalent, quote, especially in adolescents and young adult males within several days after COVID-19 vaccination.
[00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:59.082]  After mRNA COVID vaccination, either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, more often after the second dose, and usually within a week of vaccination.
[00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:16.128]  Over a year ago, at the end of October in 2020, the Food and Drug Administration's Product Advisory Committee even identified all of these threats to heart health from the COVID vaccine, but decided to allow its administration to populations around the world anyway.
[00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:29.913]  During the FDA's committee meeting, a slide was briefly revealed titled, FDA Safety Surveillance of COVID-19 Vaccines, Draft Working List of Possible Adverse Event Outcomes.
[00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:39.457]  This long list of vaccine side effects included the same two illnesses identified by the CDC, myocarditis and pericarditis.
[00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:45.059]  It also included the American Heart Association's observation of increased thrombosis.
[00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.447]  Identified as venous thromboembolism, which is when a blood clot forms in a deep vein.
[00:03:51.447 --> 00:04:02.322]  The FDA also lists another blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's blood vessels.
[00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:15.513]  Aside from heart attacks, obstructed blood vessels also account for about 87% of all strokes, which is also named by the FDA as an adverse event from the COVID vaccines.
[00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:19.336]  So, with such clear evidence of cardiovascular diseases,
[00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:26.124]  Why are the mRNA and other COVID vaccines still being administered to the public worldwide?
[00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:34.374]  Is this why vaccinated athletes around the world have been collapsing and suddenly dying in the middle of a cardio-heavy performance?
[00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.818]  Maybe this is all because of post-pandemic stress disorder.
[00:04:38.058 --> 00:04:47.041]  And trying to identify any other culprit for the uptick in heart disease will only stress us out even further, causing our hearts to explode.
[00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.822]  I guess we should be good little globalists.
[00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.343]  Get in line, and take our boosters.
[00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.964]  This Christmas, and for years to come.
[00:04:54.964 --> 00:04:58.826]  This is Brian Wilson with InfoWars.com
[00:04:59.406 --> 00:05:04.937]  Everything I do, everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:09.687]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering
[00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.956]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:28.227]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.468]  It is the true digital economy.
[00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:34.591]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendental control.
[00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:43.674]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:51.456]  But I gotta tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available out the month of December 2021.
[00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:54.316]  It's here at ResetWars.com.
[00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:58.417]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:00.718]  The globalists fear this information.
[00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:13.847]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:22.029]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:28.952]  Well, the good news is there is a large portion of humanity of every race, color and creed that is awake and knows what's going on.
[00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:32.133]  It's always an informed minority that stops tyranny in the end.
[00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:35.074]  The bad news is the globalists, out of desperation, have pulled the trigger
[00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:36.706]  We're good to go.
[00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:03.464]  Leaders coming out saying it's a New World Order criminal takeover.
[00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:12.989]  We have the top German Cardinal, who's also the head of the Vatican Court, coming out and saying everything I've said word for word, basically.
[00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:14.770]  You've got Tucker Carlson saying it.
[00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.371]  You've got countless people getting it.
[00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.832]  Dr. Peter McCullough has gone super viral on Joe Rogan.
[00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:26.556]  He's now over 50 million views on different platforms with his life-saving three-hour interview just devastating the New World Order.
[00:07:27.717 --> 00:07:30.278]  And saying this is purposeful, this is all by design.
[00:07:30.278 --> 00:07:35.101]  Obviously we've had private discussions, he knows that, but now he's going public with it.
[00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.483]  Devastating to their operation.
[00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.003]  Devastating.
[00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:51.109]  Because when you figure out this was all a plan on purpose, then you understand how much trouble we're in, that you're going to have to break with the system and say no, and that giving in and submitting only makes it worse.
[00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:54.091]  Meanwhile, there's just so much crazy news
[00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.450]  The federal government has officially announced that highways are racist.
[00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.531]  They're going to start tearing them down, not just not repairing them.
[00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:13.694]  And the Salvation Army has seen its donations be cut in almost half after they sent out to their donors saying, you're evil white people.
[00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:17.155]  You need to give money to Salvation Army because you're racist.
[00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:20.256]  People are like, I've been giving to you for decades, in some cases millions of dollars.
[00:08:20.256 --> 00:08:21.416]  You insult me like this?
[00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:22.016]  Screw you.
[00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:22.817]  I mean, go
[00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:28.653]  Woke, get broke, or get woke, go broke.
[00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:29.633]  There's that type of news.
[00:08:29.633 --> 00:08:31.714]  And then there's stuff like this.
[00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:34.974]  Senator Blumenthal speaks at Communist Award Show.
[00:08:34.974 --> 00:08:37.675]  This is Fox News, touts Build Back Better.
[00:08:37.675 --> 00:08:51.858]  He's the guy that runs the law firm that's running the lawsuits against us in all these rigged jurisdictions who already bankrupted Remington and is now moving against all the other major gun makers and the NRA.
[00:08:53.177 --> 00:09:03.159]  So you understand, folks, I'm under attack by the very group destroying the NRA, destroying Smith & Wesson, destroying Remington, destroying everything.
[00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.859]  I don't say that like, oh, I'm a victim.
[00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:06.900]  I'm the tip of the spear.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.060]  And you're the tip of the spear.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:18.702]  And that's why it's so important that you take this live broadcast feed from your local radio station, TV station, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, FreeWorldNews.tv is the link that won't get you censored or banned.
[00:09:18.702 --> 00:09:21.383]  FreeWorldNews.tv for all the videos and live feeds.
[00:09:22.698 --> 00:09:30.187]  Get it out there, because they wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't so incredibly effective.
[00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:32.790]  So, we're the antidote to the New World Order.
[00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:38.316]  You taking action and delivering the antidote is how we heal the body politic.
[00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:42.469]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:42.469 --> 00:09:55.559]  Elon Musk is now coming out more against the New World Order, and more against socialism, and more against the globalists, and more against the Democrats, and more against depopulation, and also against the globalist AI systems, and he's coming out
[00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:03.713]  Now I'm saying just so many things that have got them pulling their hair out like we should have more children.
[00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:04.494]  That's coming up.
[00:10:04.494 --> 00:10:09.196]  We've got huge inflation news, rising grocery prices at record levels.
[00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:18.001]  Peter Schiff and Tucker Carlson, we should get him on next week, discusses the worst inflation in US history, because that's really what it is, and so much more.
[00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:23.805]  But the first thing I want to hit today is the four stacks that I must cover
[00:10:24.705 --> 00:10:28.908]  of the most bombshell COVID-19 world government takeover.
[00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:35.212]  So one stack is the martial law announcements, the forced inoculation, door-to-door injections.
[00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:38.714]  In five countries have announced that, which means it's coming here next.
[00:10:38.714 --> 00:10:41.556]  It's all run by the UN.
[00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:45.919]  The UN caught running the migrant waves, mainstream news invading the US.
[00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:48.341]  So I've got the whole UN global government takeover arm.
[00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:56.499]  Then we've got studies by the government of Germany, the UK government, the Swedish government, and a bunch of others.
[00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:04.050]  Admitting that you're twice as likely, as the previous study said, to get COVID, to be hospitalized, or die.
[00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.532]  It's the same number, double what all the studies show.
[00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:10.594]  New studies, three new studies on that I've got in the stack.
[00:11:10.594 --> 00:11:20.741]  Another German study by a pro-vaccine medical group, but now they're saying, well, just make sure nobody has any cancer when you give them the shot because it
[00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:26.125]  Massively accelerates cancer at levels never before seen.
[00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:36.694]  Within weeks, we're talking about cancers metastasizing all over the body and growing at rates like something out of a science fiction movie.
[00:11:36.694 --> 00:11:45.601]  Like what happened with the first lady they found had a mortal gene line in 1951 when she died when a tumor ate her in a week and a half.
[00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.643]  Tumor was the size of the head of a pen.
[00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:53.635]  When it got discovered it was the size of a quarter, we can have later it weighed 40-something pounds and she was gone, it ate her.
[00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:56.937]  It's like the blob, you grow the blob, it just eats you.
[00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:57.657]  That's what happened.
[00:11:57.657 --> 00:12:10.042]  We have the CAT scans, we have the MRIs, we have the studies of how you take the Pfizer shot when you've got a tiny cancer, and within two weeks it eats you alive.
[00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:10.943]  Woo!
[00:12:10.943 --> 00:12:15.185]  I mean, this is hard core.
[00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.945]  We have got so much to break down.
[00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:17.886]  I'm going to air this as well.
[00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:20.932]  That's why I've cleared the decks here.
[00:12:20.932 --> 00:12:25.399]  So I'm going to play these emergency warnings from Dr. Peter McCullough and from
[00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:31.749]  Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology, the full warning is on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:31.749 --> 00:12:39.935]  Inventor of mRNA vaccine warns parents jabs could permanently damage children's critical organs.
[00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:41.356]  And he shows the studies.
[00:12:41.356 --> 00:12:49.501]  Meanwhile, the FDA and CDC back boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters for minors.
[00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:51.142]  But the real tests show what it does.
[00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:53.143]  This is mass murder of our children.
[00:12:53.143 --> 00:12:53.704]  That's coming up.
[00:12:54.504 --> 00:12:58.885]  In the second hour today, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Malone, and so much more.
[00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:01.266]  I talked to McCullough this morning.
[00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:06.448]  He's going to be in studio sometime probably next week, if not right after Christmas.
[00:13:06.448 --> 00:13:07.468]  Doing a huge PowerPoint.
[00:13:07.468 --> 00:13:11.629]  I'm going to turn the show over to him for the full three hours.
[00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:13.250]  So look for that.
[00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.650]  He's going to host.
[00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.651]  In fact, this is such an emergency I might even go
[00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:27.674]  Network commercial free and just have the local ads for the local stations because we've got to get this out to our full audience of four to five million people just on the AM and FM stations every day.
[00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:29.276]  People have got to have this.
[00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:30.177]  They've got to share this.
[00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:31.418]  They've got to get this out.
[00:13:31.418 --> 00:13:32.739]  We talk about a couple other things here.
[00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:34.421]  If you get your orders in by
[00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.850]  Thursday, anywhere in the United States, you get it well before Christmas.
[00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.430]  By Friday, almost everywhere, you'll get it well before Christmas.
[00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.212]  But you really need to get your orders in this week and support the broadcast and get great things that wake people up.
[00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:47.932]  COVID Land 2 is now out.
[00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:50.553]  COVID Land The Mask is now out.
[00:13:50.553 --> 00:13:51.413]  Part 2 we produced.
[00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:52.413]  So powerful.
[00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:58.154]  And you get a free copy of two films, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death, free.
[00:13:58.154 --> 00:14:00.775]  So three films for the price of one for a limited time.
[00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.898]  I was literally in the vault over at one of our facilities today and I said, why are there
[00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:30.046]  10 boxes of coins left.
[00:14:30.046 --> 00:14:33.107]  I was told we sold out of coins yesterday.
[00:14:33.107 --> 00:14:34.788]  And they said, well, we held back 500 coins.
[00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:36.628]  I mean, because in case there's any problems or anything.
[00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:40.270]  I said, we're not going to even have 100 coins that have problems getting delivered.
[00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.070]  You've got to sign for these.
[00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.471]  And so I made the decision, the crew's great, they're not bad.
[00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:46.492]  I was telling you how this happened.
[00:14:46.492 --> 00:14:48.853]  That no, we're not going to keep 500 coins.
[00:14:48.853 --> 00:14:49.873]  We're going to keep 100 coins.
[00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:59.625]  So, there are 420-something coins as of an hour ago, and I checked it, available of the 1776 Founder Coin at 1776coin.com or infowarestore.com.
[00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.007]  But 1776, just the number, 1776coin.
[00:15:01.007 --> 00:15:01.708]  1776coin.com.
[00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:13.213]  goes directly to the subsection of the InfoWars store shopping cart.
[00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:14.893]  This is a founder coin.
[00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:18.854]  When you leave your email with us, you will get exclusive deals, exclusive content.
[00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:23.274]  I got a bunch of stuff coming out early next year, and believe me, you'll be glad you did this.
[00:15:23.274 --> 00:15:26.155]  It helps us fund and finish that infrastructure.
[00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:30.296]  It really is a beautiful, historic coin with George Washington slaying the dragon.
[00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:35.776]  There's only 400 left of these of the 10,000, and then no more will ever be made.
[00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:38.517]  I mean, if we don't have any problems with 100 coins or so with shipment,
[00:15:38.857 --> 00:15:39.497]  We're good to go.
[00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:06.533]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free from it.
[00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:09.235]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:24.624]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the Great Reset and want a one-world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[00:16:24.624 --> 00:16:26.585]  After decades of intense research,
[00:16:27.924 --> 00:16:33.549]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the global response is now live.
[00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:36.512]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[00:16:36.512 --> 00:16:40.355]  Start your journey at ResetWars.com today.
[00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:46.481]  They're programming our very subconscious and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control.
[00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:48.803]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[00:16:48.803 --> 00:16:53.407]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at ResetWars.com.
[00:16:53.407 --> 00:16:54.268]  Please join me there.
[00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:04.223]  Get our grate and a bag of it here.
[00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:07.704]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[00:17:07.704 --> 00:17:08.804]  The communist!
[00:17:08.804 --> 00:17:16.146]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:21.428]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:26.110]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:30.491]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:37.393]  Next up, sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:17:37.393 --> 00:17:41.554]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[00:17:41.554 --> 00:17:44.634]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:48.935]  Um... We had like the... You wouldn't believe it.
[00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:55.317]  Anyway, so, it's InfoWarsStore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us and don't want us here, that's fine.
[00:18:01.505 --> 00:18:04.917]  What are champions made of?
[00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.061]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:18:12.517 --> 00:18:14.178]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:16.079]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:17.379]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:18.560]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.840]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.141]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:42.291]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:45.572]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:18:45.572 --> 00:18:46.933]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore outline.
[00:18:46.933 --> 00:18:48.374]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:48.374 --> 00:18:52.576]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[00:19:06.923 --> 00:19:16.048]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class.
[00:19:16.048 --> 00:19:18.029]  And that's done by design.
[00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:32.957]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:39.675]  Until 10 years ago, the media said, the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[00:19:39.675 --> 00:19:49.303]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public, and its former head, still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the Great Reset, a global government.
[00:19:49.303 --> 00:19:57.409]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalists head-on about the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:59.091]  If we do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:06.018]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:25.204]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:26.344]  InfoWars.
[00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:27.865]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:20:30.623 --> 00:20:34.745]  There are things the enemies of humanity don't want us to know.
[00:20:34.745 --> 00:20:37.707]  There are secrets they want to keep.
[00:20:37.707 --> 00:20:39.568]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:39.568 --> 00:20:43.250]  And I've made it my life mission to expose those secrets and empower humanity.
[00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.712]  And I've made my greatest discovery yet.
[00:20:45.712 --> 00:20:49.274]  Join me there as humanity goes to the next level at ResetWars.com.
[00:20:54.932 --> 00:20:58.534]  Reset Wars is now live at ResetWars.com.
[00:20:58.534 --> 00:21:01.355]  See the whole course, Mind Wars, Spirit Wars.
[00:21:01.355 --> 00:21:02.575]  Get 25% off.
[00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:07.197]  The deal ends tonight, exactly 1159 p.m.
[00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:09.718]  And of course, this will also fund our operation.
[00:21:09.718 --> 00:21:17.562]  You know, I've only seen George Strait once at the Houston Rodeo, and then once when he played a birthday party for somebody that I know.
[00:21:17.562 --> 00:21:22.904]  Then he just popped in at a honky-tonk outside Fredericksburg for 30 minutes and played a few songs.
[00:21:22.904 --> 00:21:24.085]  Jason The Hole was there playing.
[00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:30.533]  And I want to go see him, you know, before he completely retires.
[00:21:30.533 --> 00:21:35.497]  And crappy seats that are up in the upper deck are $1,000.
[00:21:35.497 --> 00:21:36.738]  And I did.
[00:21:36.738 --> 00:21:40.121]  I bought six tickets to it.
[00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:42.383]  Now, because I'm not someone that just splurges on stuff like that.
[00:21:42.383 --> 00:21:43.324]  I like George Strait.
[00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:43.985]  It's an event.
[00:21:43.985 --> 00:21:44.525]  I'm going to do it.
[00:21:44.525 --> 00:21:46.146]  I want to see him again.
[00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:47.848]  It's coming up pretty soon.
[00:21:49.198 --> 00:21:56.521]  And I remember being 18 years old down there with my girlfriend, driving down to Houston to see him at the Houston Rodeo, where he got famous, where he started out.
[00:21:56.521 --> 00:21:59.363]  That's $1,000 a ticket.
[00:21:59.363 --> 00:22:10.948]  $200 and something bucks for this course that is going to launch a whole system of resistance and actual PragerU-type short films, medium films, long films on subjects.
[00:22:10.948 --> 00:22:11.648]  That's what this is.
[00:22:11.648 --> 00:22:14.850]  It's a very good deal with the massive attacks we're under.
[00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.371]  Hillary Clinton sells her stupid course for a similar price.
[00:22:18.868 --> 00:22:22.989]  That's a bunch of sycophantic victimhood and New World Order garbage.
[00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:33.132]  So believe me, this is really powerful information on how to take control of your mind, how to break your conditioning, how to separate yourself from the globalist control grid.
[00:22:33.132 --> 00:22:40.774]  And it's available at ResetWars.com right now until midnight tonight, 25% off.
[00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:44.598]  And you see the promo video up there.
[00:22:44.598 --> 00:22:45.538]  That's just the promo video.
[00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:47.959]  That's not actually the course that you see there on screen.
[00:22:47.959 --> 00:22:48.980]  That's just me talking about it.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.081]  So ResetWars.com.
[00:22:51.081 --> 00:23:01.905]  And then that will also help keep this entire infrastructure on air with all of the top scientists and researchers and political experts we get on that come on here first.
[00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:05.967]  And they get the exposure they need to then get on the other big broadcasts.
[00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:06.948]  And I'm not trying to brag.
[00:23:06.948 --> 00:23:08.889]  It's just that the enemy knows.
[00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:10.589]  And Media Matters talks about it.
[00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:11.770]  The Democratic Party talks about it.
[00:23:13.197 --> 00:23:17.540]  And the globalist UN talk about shutting down Alex Jones is critical to their takeover.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.241]  So, thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:20.221]  We're all in this together.
[00:23:20.221 --> 00:23:28.325]  If you want to fight back and don't want to be their slave, both mentally and physically and spiritually, then I would go to ResetWars.com right now and I would become a member.
[00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:34.529]  There's going to be so much more integrated and added into all of that.
[00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:36.790]  Okay, here's where I want to start getting in.
[00:23:38.638 --> 00:23:40.199]  To the globalist COVID takeover.
[00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:46.404]  I'm going to show you all the new info that just completely triple confirms everything else we knew, but even worse.
[00:23:46.404 --> 00:24:01.195]  So that we all get a fire lit under our ass to make this the front and center issue to save our children and expose how they're now globally, officially coming after them and shooting them up all over the country fiving up and now doing trials on newborn babies and covering up the illnesses and deaths.
[00:24:01.195 --> 00:24:01.395]  I mean,
[00:24:03.243 --> 00:24:07.827]  One of these articles I've got here I could talk about all day, but when I come back next segment, I'm going to just rapid-fire go through them.
[00:24:07.827 --> 00:24:10.470]  But I want to start with this.
[00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:15.194]  This is the lady Germany needs as their Chancellor, not the new monster that replaced Merkel, who's even worse.
[00:24:15.194 --> 00:24:21.460]  German member of European Parliament, Christine Anderson, speech on Big Pharma and tyranny.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.882]  She's already issued emergency SOSes.
[00:24:23.882 --> 00:24:27.766]  This is a global corporate Big Pharma takeover through the medical system.
[00:24:28.408 --> 00:24:32.337]  And this is a clarion call about what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:35.124]  Then Tucker issues the similar emergency call.
[00:24:35.124 --> 00:24:37.429]  We must all be issuing these emergency calls.
[00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:37.870]  Here she is.
[00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:43.631]  But please, do not consider me a hero.
[00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:47.152]  I'm not brave and I'm not courageous.
[00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:50.935]  I am simply doing my job.
[00:24:50.935 --> 00:24:58.459]  I was elected to Parliament to serve the people, to act on their behalf and in their best interest.
[00:24:58.459 --> 00:25:07.884]  And I couldn't think of a better way to serve your interest than to uphold freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
[00:25:09.076 --> 00:25:18.323]  But I'm telling you, the vast majority of the elected representatives, they are selling you down the river.
[00:25:20.011 --> 00:25:33.899]  You know, instead of adjusting our concept of what constitutes fully vaxxed, we need to adjust our concept of what constitutes legitimate government.
[00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:43.785]  And governments forcing people into compliance are neither legitimate nor democratic by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:25:44.847 --> 00:25:48.531]  And it isn't about your health either.
[00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:58.841]  You know, pharmaceutical companies are about as interested in public health as the arms industry is in world peace.
[00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:01.644]  Now, some of you may argue, I'm exaggerating.
[00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:04.427]  I'm misjudging the government's intentions.
[00:26:04.427 --> 00:26:06.148]  Granted, that is a possibility.
[00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:09.790]  But are you willing to take that risk?
[00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:18.895]  Can you afford this nonchalant attitude towards government, considering what we all stand to lose?
[00:26:18.895 --> 00:26:26.078]  Others may think, yeah, I kind of see where she's coming from, but nah, my government wouldn't do it.
[00:26:26.078 --> 00:26:32.862]  Well, not only would they, I'm telling you, they are already doing it as we speak.
[00:26:34.116 --> 00:26:38.778]  As Heraclit, a Greek philosopher living in the 5th century B.C.
[00:26:38.778 --> 00:26:48.043]  once said, the truth often evades being recognized due to its utter incredibility.
[00:26:48.043 --> 00:26:56.708]  So just because you cannot fathom your government having ill meanings towards you, doesn't mean it is not true.
[00:26:57.228 --> 00:27:02.530]  So imagine this happened to you, and the plane stops and is surrounded by military police.
[00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.191]  Armed men storm the aircraft and drag a man from his seat.
[00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:10.413]  So, of course, you assume at first that terrorism has just been averted.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:13.974]  The passenger must have been trying to blow up the plane with a shoe bomb or something.
[00:27:13.974 --> 00:27:15.375]  But no, that's not what this is.
[00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:16.575]  The man is not a terrorist.
[00:27:16.575 --> 00:27:17.836]  He's something worse than that.
[00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.356]  He violated COVID restrictions.
[00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:21.277]  He's a corona criminal.
[00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:22.617]  It's okay, you think.
[00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:24.218]  You're trying to be reasonable here.
[00:27:24.218 --> 00:27:28.400]  A man with COVID should not be on a commercial aircraft spreading the virus to everyone else.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.181]  And, of course, that's fair.
[00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.422]  But here's the thing.
[00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:33.463]  This man doesn't have COVID.
[00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:37.885]  He was tested right before he got on the airplane, and no trace of the virus was found.
[00:27:37.885 --> 00:27:41.807]  So why in the world is he being hauled off the flight by armed men?
[00:27:41.807 --> 00:27:43.108]  Well, here's why.
[00:27:43.108 --> 00:27:50.032]  Because the government has determined that based on his travel history, which they have been tracking, he might someday get COVID.
[00:27:51.164 --> 00:27:54.765]  Therefore, in the name of public health, he is being forcibly detained.
[00:27:54.765 --> 00:28:00.367]  Not for something he has done, but for something that he potentially might do inadvertently.
[00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:05.809]  And for that, this man is headed to a COVID camp, known euphemistically as a quarantine hotel.
[00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:08.110]  But he's not going to be a guest in this hotel.
[00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.730]  He'll be a prisoner.
[00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:11.219]  Now, all of this just happened.
[00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:12.320]  In North Korea, you ask?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.261]  No.
[00:28:13.261 --> 00:28:20.266]  In the Netherlands, one of the most, quote, liberal countries in the world, home of the Hague, the International Court of Justice.
[00:28:20.266 --> 00:28:22.567]  This just happened at the Amsterdam airport.
[00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.229]  You may have been there.
[00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:25.890]  Think twice about going back.
[00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.892]  Okay, and it's the same thing in Australia, and the same thing in Canada.
[00:28:28.892 --> 00:28:30.433]  It's pre-crime, and it gets worse.
[00:28:30.433 --> 00:28:32.815]  Tucker, the day before, interviewed a senator.
[00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.592]  From Australia, who's been critical of lockdowns, he tested negative inside the country traveling.
[00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:45.315]  They came and grabbed him at his house and took him to a camp and said they may not let him out if he complains.
[00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:46.795]  Oh, that's the new thing.
[00:28:46.795 --> 00:28:49.096]  They're keeping people longer than even the two weeks.
[00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:49.956]  It's all fake.
[00:28:49.956 --> 00:28:51.437]  It's a cover for martial law.
[00:28:51.437 --> 00:28:54.478]  By the time you figure it out, you're locked down inside the Great Reset.
[00:28:54.478 --> 00:28:55.439]  Build Back Better.
[00:28:55.439 --> 00:28:56.219]  This is The Takeover.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.740]  Hey everybody.

[00:29:25.282 --> 00:29:27.184]  Hair and Beard Support, 60% off.
[00:29:27.184 --> 00:29:30.087]  We also have COVID Land 2, the mask film.
[00:29:30.087 --> 00:29:35.733]  When you order the very important film, you get a free DVD with two films on it about Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:36.094]  Turbo,
[00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:37.055]  Thank you.
[00:29:59.451 --> 00:30:00.772]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:30:00.772 --> 00:30:02.813]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[00:30:02.813 --> 00:30:03.214]  Welcome.
[00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:03.934]  Hello, Alex?
[00:30:03.934 --> 00:30:04.514]  Yes, Malcolm.
[00:30:04.514 --> 00:30:08.817]  All right, I'll make this quick and real short, where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:13.400]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.402]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[00:30:16.402 --> 00:30:19.024]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.085]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:25.988]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[00:30:25.988 --> 00:30:32.753]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[00:30:32.753 --> 00:30:34.594]  This is like a very fine wine.
[00:30:34.594 --> 00:30:36.735]  In fact, each batch is different.
[00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:39.157]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[00:30:39.157 --> 00:30:42.439]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[00:30:42.439 --> 00:30:43.379]  That's just how it is.
[00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:44.040]  It's how it works.
[00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:48.772]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[00:30:48.772 --> 00:30:52.602]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[00:30:59.136 --> 00:31:03.340]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.924]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:31:06.924 --> 00:31:09.527]  And we could never get the ingredients again.
[00:31:09.527 --> 00:31:10.468]  Until now.
[00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:16.554]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[00:31:16.554 --> 00:31:20.338]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[00:31:20.338 --> 00:31:21.159]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:26.741]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:36.244]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[00:31:36.244 --> 00:31:40.406]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[00:31:40.406 --> 00:31:42.847]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[00:31:42.847 --> 00:31:43.147]  It's got
[00:31:43.387 --> 00:31:43.687]  We're good.
[00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:02.599]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:17.312]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[00:32:17.312 --> 00:32:25.559]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:27.540]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:35.342]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[00:32:35.342 --> 00:32:38.703]  government military grade, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:38.703 --> 00:32:44.465]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:44.465 --> 00:32:51.588]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:52.328]  It's all there.
[00:32:53.069 --> 00:32:53.910]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.437 --> 00:33:18.459]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:26.742]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.742 --> 00:33:28.722]  What a time to be alive.
[00:33:28.722 --> 00:33:35.345]  They are putting full bore total medical martial law with forced injections in place under UN control.
[00:33:35.345 --> 00:33:38.166]  I told you 20 plus months ago that by the winter,
[00:33:38.906 --> 00:33:43.587]  Of 2021, they would start mass arrests around the world, putting people in camps.
[00:33:43.587 --> 00:33:46.828]  Then they would normalize that worldwide and move that to the United States.
[00:33:46.828 --> 00:33:49.048]  That is now beginning.
[00:33:49.048 --> 00:34:04.092]  Wednesday live, globalist-controlled world leaders announced new lockdowns, forced inoculation plans, saying nothing is off the table, says the new German dictator, who, again, through parliamentary manipulation, was installed.
[00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:18.482]  And then the head of the unelected European Union Commission, set up in 1956 under treaty with the countries they say the forced inoculation start, and so does the new German Chancellor, February 1st.
[00:34:18.482 --> 00:34:28.045]  Wednesday live, globalist-controlled world leaders announce new lockdowns, forced inoculation plans, saying nothing is off the table.
[00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:29.065]  So let's do this right now.
[00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:35.775]  Let's look at this incredibly life-saving article that must get out to everyone you know.
[00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:38.356]  So take it, post it on your own website, I don't care.
[00:34:38.356 --> 00:34:45.017]  However you got to get it past the censors, get this video and get this out.
[00:34:45.017 --> 00:34:52.138]  Inventor of mRNA vaccine warns parents, jabs could permanently damage children's critical organs.
[00:34:52.138 --> 00:34:55.039]  Because they tried to get this stuff done before, it always failed.
[00:34:56.758 --> 00:34:58.579]  In a certain percentage of people.
[00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:12.123]  You can design mRNA to kill cancer, you name it, but a good percentage of the time, it causes a leukemia, or it causes liver failure, and in the case of spike proteins, all of the above, including blood clots.
[00:35:12.123 --> 00:35:19.045]  Inventor of mRNA vaccine warns parents jabs could permanently damage children's critical organs.
[00:35:19.045 --> 00:35:20.166]  On the heels of that, FDA
[00:35:21.457 --> 00:35:28.779]  CDC, totally controlled by Big Pharma, backs boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters.
[00:35:28.779 --> 00:35:35.640]  And they made the boards resign months ago that weren't even for boosters for old people.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:44.182]  And coming up, I'm going to show you the CAT scans and big studies out on what happens to cancer patients after they take the Pfizer shot alone.
[00:35:44.182 --> 00:35:46.223]  Moderna's three times stronger.
[00:35:46.223 --> 00:35:47.803]  The same damn thing, just three times stronger.
[00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.791]  Let's continue.
[00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:55.096]  FDA, CDC back boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters for minors.
[00:35:55.096 --> 00:36:01.361]  This is the biggest power trip of the eugenicist, depopulationist Bill Gates the world has ever seen.
[00:36:01.361 --> 00:36:04.344]  I mean, he is just on cloud nine killing everybody right now.
[00:36:04.344 --> 00:36:08.607]  Unvaxed US Google employees set to lose pay and get fired.
[00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:10.149]  Isn't that nice working for such a company?
[00:36:11.152 --> 00:36:13.193]  Report, FDA colludes with U.S.
[00:36:13.193 --> 00:36:15.394]  Postal Service to destroy ivermectin shipments.
[00:36:15.394 --> 00:36:23.218]  The FDA has now confirmed the letters real as of yesterday, and they say that doctors are not allowed to send you even legal ivermectin.
[00:36:23.218 --> 00:36:24.959]  You are going to die.
[00:36:24.959 --> 00:36:26.200]  That's the whole plan.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.980]  Unbelievable criminal government.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.583]  Flashback, Fauci admits COVID vaccine could actually make people worse with ADE.
[00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:36.785]  But they don't want you to know that, and Twitter bans you if you try to share his own video.
[00:36:38.795 --> 00:36:39.315]  Video.
[00:36:39.315 --> 00:36:44.239]  Third pro football player in a week experiencing severe chest pain has to go to the hospital.
[00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:54.786]  And one of the top soccer players in the world, Sergio Aguero, has announced his retirement from football at age 33 due to heart conditions caused by the Pfizer vaccine.
[00:36:54.786 --> 00:36:57.407]  Heart swelling.
[00:36:57.407 --> 00:36:59.909]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:05.673]  government under Biden is now saying they're getting ready for new major restrictions.
[00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:08.555]  And the London Guardian runs the headline, Get Used To It.
[00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:16.377]  Get used to it, working from home, maybe for life, not just Christmas.
[00:37:16.377 --> 00:37:19.079]  Isn't that just cute?
[00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:21.982]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:37:21.982 --> 00:37:32.410]  Remember, the worst part of the 15 days to flatten the curve, you know, the worst part of the first 15 days, right, to flatten the curve, is the first two years.
[00:37:33.806 --> 00:37:36.608]  We're about to enter year number three.
[00:37:36.608 --> 00:37:37.489]  Get used to it.
[00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.651]  Working from home may be for life, not just Christmas, says the Guardian.
[00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:43.731]  You're non-essential now.
[00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:44.951]  You're locked up in your house.
[00:37:44.951 --> 00:37:46.092]  Wear your mask.
[00:37:46.092 --> 00:37:46.672]  Comply.
[00:37:46.672 --> 00:37:49.572]  You'll get out of the crisis, which they now say will never end.
[00:37:49.572 --> 00:37:54.653]  Biden, on video, says, what's the big deal, man, about vaccine mandates?
[00:37:54.653 --> 00:37:59.254]  Says it's patriotic to take the jab, the third, the fourth, the fifth jab.
[00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:08.796]  German Chancellor says there will be no red lines, nothing off the table, as regards to COVID restrictions, including forced inoculations and the arrest and imprisonment of those that don't take whatever the new shot is.
[00:38:08.796 --> 00:38:11.336]  Because you know what the un-vaxxed and the vaxxed have in common?
[00:38:12.725 --> 00:38:15.846]  You're never fully vexed.
[00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:22.529]  And it gets a lot worse after that, but let me go to Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA's emergency warning to parents.
[00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:24.770]  Here it is.
[00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:31.753]  I'm a physician and a scientist, but more importantly, I'm a father and a grandfather.
[00:38:31.753 --> 00:38:41.637]  I don't usually read from a prepared speech, but this is so important that I wanted to make sure that I got every single word and fact, scientific fact, correct.
[00:38:43.228 --> 00:38:49.051]  I stand by this statement with a career dedicated to vaccine research and development.
[00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:53.773]  I'm vaccinated for COVID and I'm generally pro-vaccination.
[00:38:53.773 --> 00:39:03.437]  I've devoted my entire career to developing safe and effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases.
[00:39:03.437 --> 00:39:10.141]  After this, I'll be posting the text of this statement so that you can share it with your friends and family.
[00:39:10.141 --> 00:39:10.741]  Here's the thing.
[00:39:13.311 --> 00:39:30.544]  Before you inject your child, a decision that is irreversible, I wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based on the RNA vaccine technology I created.
[00:39:30.544 --> 00:39:37.849]  There are three main issues that parents need to understand before they take this irrevocable decision.
[00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:46.527]  The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your parent's cells.
[00:39:46.527 --> 00:39:52.629]  This gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike proteins.
[00:39:52.629 --> 00:39:58.790]  These proteins often cause permanent damage in children's critical organs.
[00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:08.792]  These organs include their brain and nervous system, their heart and blood vessels, including blood clots, their reproductive system,
[00:40:10.563 --> 00:40:18.025]  And most importantly, this vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to their immune system.
[00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:24.787]  The most alarming point about this is that once these damages have occurred, they are irreparable.
[00:40:24.787 --> 00:40:27.988]  They cannot be reversed.
[00:40:27.988 --> 00:40:32.449]  You can't fix the lesions within their brains.
[00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:35.750]  You cannot repair heart tissue scarring.
[00:40:38.086 --> 00:40:44.069]  You cannot repair a genetically reset immune system.
[00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:54.996]  And this vaccine can cause reproductive damage that could affect future generations of your family.
[00:40:54.996 --> 00:41:02.180]  The second thing you need to know is about the fact that this novel technology has not been adequately tested.
[00:41:04.383 --> 00:41:14.925]  We need at least five years of testing and research before we can really understand the risks associated with this new technology.
[00:41:14.925 --> 00:41:25.066]  The harms and risks from new medicines often become revealed many years later.
[00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:33.608]  I ask you to ask yourself, as a fellow parent, if you want your child
[00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:41.471]  To be part of the most radical experiment in human history.
[00:41:41.471 --> 00:41:43.612]  One final point.
[00:41:43.612 --> 00:41:48.694]  The reason they're giving you to vaccinate your child is a lie.
[00:41:48.694 --> 00:41:54.956]  Your children represent no danger to their parents or grandparents.
[00:41:54.956 --> 00:41:56.196]  It's actually the opposite.
[00:41:57.816 --> 00:42:09.580]  Their immunity after getting COVID is critical to save your family, if not the world, from this disease.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:23.905]  Finally, in summary, there's no benefit for your children or your family to be vaccinating your children against the small risks of the virus, given the known health risks
[00:42:25.205 --> 00:42:35.910]  of the vaccine that as a parent, you and your children may have to live with for the rest of your lives.
[00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:43.114]  The risk benefit analysis is not even close with this vaccine for children.
[00:42:43.114 --> 00:42:52.479]  As a parent and grandparent, my strong recommendation to you is to resist and fight to protect your children.
[00:42:58.197 --> 00:42:59.498]  So this could be.
[00:42:59.498 --> 00:43:03.201]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:06.964]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order.
[00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.251]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[00:43:11.251 --> 00:43:26.475]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[00:43:26.475 --> 00:43:28.736]  It is the true digital economy.
[00:43:28.736 --> 00:43:32.937]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:41.922]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God, and God's divine empowerment and blessing.

[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.641]  I'm in California.
[00:45:09.641 --> 00:45:12.323]  People are asleep and program controlled.
[00:45:12.323 --> 00:45:12.783]  I agree.
[00:45:12.783 --> 00:45:14.905]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[00:45:14.905 --> 00:45:15.506]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:16.867]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:45:16.867 --> 00:45:18.768]  Can I plug Alex real quick?
[00:45:18.768 --> 00:45:19.209]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:26.615]  Hey, I'm in my 60s, and I do the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I work them into the ground, and you want to know why?
[00:45:26.615 --> 00:45:32.560]  And I've tested this, and I've taken your B12, and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.661]  I really do.
[00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:36.203]  I take that B12, and I'm electric, man.
[00:45:36.563 --> 00:45:37.604]  I can run 10 miles.
[00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:49.835]  I do some pretty heavy work with the highway department, and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[00:45:49.835 --> 00:45:51.597]  The B-12 saves my life.
[00:45:59.511 --> 00:46:03.713]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars live products.
[00:46:03.713 --> 00:46:07.275]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:10.837]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:16.920]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.682]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[00:46:20.682 --> 00:46:21.523]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[00:46:21.923 --> 00:46:27.107]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[00:46:27.107 --> 00:46:36.614]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[00:46:36.614 --> 00:46:40.778]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[00:46:40.778 --> 00:46:43.220]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:43.540]  It's got
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.761]  We're good to go.
[00:47:11.649 --> 00:47:15.771]  It's forever and ever.
[00:47:56.431 --> 00:47:58.072]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:58.072 --> 00:47:59.812]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:59.812 --> 00:48:04.574]  We're going to be white hot forever together with God.
[00:48:04.574 --> 00:48:07.255]  That's what the globalists can't stand.
[00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:14.735]  All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this Wednesday, December 15th transmission.
[00:48:14.735 --> 00:48:21.397]  And coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play amazing excerpts of Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:48:21.397 --> 00:48:38.142]  And I'm not tooting my horn, but I fight the globalists so hard that my biggest pleasures that I want to share with you are helping get amazing, informative people on air and then seeing it explode.
[00:48:39.827 --> 00:48:48.213]  And I was instrumental in getting Dr. Peter McCullough on with Joe Rogan, and it's now arguably the biggest interview he's ever done, which I was the biggest.
[00:48:48.213 --> 00:48:53.137]  You could argue of the interviews, Elon Musk and Alex Jones are the two biggest Joe Rogan interviews.
[00:48:53.137 --> 00:49:02.503]  And they can argue it either way, which interviews are the biggest, but they're all, they all get 50 to 100 million views, depending on which interview it is on all platforms.
[00:49:02.503 --> 00:49:04.344]  Those are low numbers.
[00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:04.845]  Low numbers.
[00:49:06.438 --> 00:49:12.664]  50 to 100 million views, biggest podcast ever, and all of Joe's top podcasts are Elon Musk and Alex Jones.
[00:49:12.664 --> 00:49:16.328]  There's some other big ones under that.
[00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:20.071]  This is already rivaling those and will probably get bigger.
[00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:20.812]  I love it.
[00:49:20.812 --> 00:49:24.495]  I want my records replaced with somebody saving children.
[00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:25.196]  This is awesome.
[00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:28.099]  But there's that added deliciousness that
[00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:34.251]  Fuckin' rollerball at the end when he gets the ball after everything he's gone through, into the goal.
[00:49:34.251 --> 00:49:40.674]  It's like, you're dying, you're under attack, they're coming after you, but you just, the worse it gets, the more you score.
[00:49:40.674 --> 00:49:42.935]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:49:42.935 --> 00:49:52.701]  So as bad as all of the globalist takeovers are, and as horrible as the things they do to us and our families, and the spiritual warfare and all the rest of it,
[00:49:54.221 --> 00:50:08.529]  I'm just so thankful for this audience praying for us and keeping us on air and keeping us in attack formation because without you we wouldn't be here and all of the success we've had and all the good work we've done and all the major pushback we're seeing because we really are the resistance.
[00:50:08.529 --> 00:50:12.232]  That's all of us together, this family of this broadcast.
[00:50:12.232 --> 00:50:16.074]  It's just amazing because if it wasn't for you putting up with this loudmouth Texan
[00:50:16.932 --> 00:50:20.955]  If it wasn't for you and your prayer and your financial support and your word of mouth, we would not be here.
[00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:25.239]  So everything you see happening is not this guy.
[00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:26.480]  Yes, I'm a focal point.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.400]  I'm willing to do it.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.301]  I don't back down.
[00:50:28.301 --> 00:50:29.422]  I can't stop.
[00:50:29.422 --> 00:50:30.042]  I get threatened.
[00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:31.644]  It makes me get more aggressive.
[00:50:31.644 --> 00:50:35.647]  God chose me for this mission right at the tip of the spear because God knows who I am.
[00:50:35.647 --> 00:50:36.868]  God formed me.
[00:50:36.868 --> 00:50:37.748]  God built me for this.
[00:50:37.748 --> 00:50:38.989]  Now I can see it more than ever.
[00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:40.110]  It's unbelievable.
[00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:42.112]  But it is our communion.
[00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:44.830]  It is our Congress.
[00:50:44.830 --> 00:51:00.496]  It is our coming together that did this, and I salute you, and I thank you, and I appreciate you, because as horrible as a lot of things are, at least we're in the thick of battle together and having major victory every time a good person stands up.
[00:51:00.496 --> 00:51:02.357]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[00:51:02.357 --> 00:51:04.878]  They said, how do we defeat evil?
[00:51:04.878 --> 00:51:06.379]  How do we defeat corruption?
[00:51:06.379 --> 00:51:07.839]  How do we defeat the King of England?
[00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:12.021]  And he wrote letters and gave speeches and said it many different ways, but the famous quote is,
[00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:19.502]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:51:19.502 --> 00:51:23.464]  Well, I believed that 30 years ago when I started trying to get on air.
[00:51:23.464 --> 00:51:27.206]  And I got on air 28 years ago now.
[00:51:27.206 --> 00:51:29.227]  And I've seen nothing but victory.
[00:51:29.227 --> 00:51:31.088]  I mean, there's been defeats on the way.
[00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:32.549]  I lost a lot of battles.
[00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:34.490]  But every damn war, I win in the end.
[00:51:35.618 --> 00:51:43.203]  No matter how bad it looks, no matter how much it looks like I'm going down, no matter how bloodied I am, no matter how horrible it is, I've learned.
[00:51:43.203 --> 00:51:44.124]  Because used to, I didn't know.
[00:51:44.124 --> 00:51:45.024]  I just couldn't help myself.
[00:51:45.024 --> 00:51:45.825]  I didn't back down.
[00:51:45.825 --> 00:51:47.666]  I thought, hell, I'm losing, but I'm going to keep fighting.
[00:51:47.666 --> 00:51:52.809]  And then I kept noticing, when I don't give up, I just get stronger.
[00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:58.773]  And crazier and crazier stuff ends up happening.
[00:51:58.773 --> 00:52:04.677]  And it just gets more and more amazing what's unfolding.
[00:52:05.973 --> 00:52:08.695]  And that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:08.695 --> 00:52:11.457]  So, we have to stand up.
[00:52:11.457 --> 00:52:12.717]  We have to beat these people.
[00:52:12.717 --> 00:52:15.199]  They are coming after our children.
[00:52:15.199 --> 00:52:18.101]  In fact, they're not coming after them.
[00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:20.783]  I say that because I want to take away some of my guilt.
[00:52:20.783 --> 00:52:23.364]  They're already killing them right now, en masse, with these damn shots.
[00:52:23.364 --> 00:52:25.125]  I mean, they are exterminating children.
[00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:28.948]  You hear about Joseph Mengele killing little kids in the death camps.
[00:52:28.948 --> 00:52:33.611]  Well, this is going on right now, for sure, and we know so.
[00:52:34.352 --> 00:52:39.378]  You just heard Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA, telling you that.
[00:52:39.378 --> 00:52:41.260]  And I'll just leave it at this.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:50.470]  Behind the scenes, all these scientists say it's deliberate, it's a world government takeover, it's the Great Reset, it's a depopulation, the ADE is going to start killing people en masse, they're going to say it's a new variant.
[00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.313]  Alex, you've got to tell them, because they're not willing to go all the way.
[00:52:55.552 --> 00:52:58.674]  Everybody knows I'm ready, because I've already, that's my lot in life.
[00:52:58.674 --> 00:53:00.075]  I'm not like, oh, I'm a hero.
[00:53:00.075 --> 00:53:01.336]  I'm on the suicide mission.
[00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:02.157]  Everybody understands that.
[00:53:02.157 --> 00:53:06.520]  I'm, this is the real Suicide Squad, not some Marvel comic show, folks.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.061]  This is the Suicide Squad.
[00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:09.462]  And it doesn't mean I want to die.
[00:53:09.462 --> 00:53:16.367]  A suicide mission is a mission you're being sent on where you've got at least a 50% chance of not coming out of it.
[00:53:16.367 --> 00:53:19.790]  Well, there is nowhere I'd want to be but on the Suicide Squad.
[00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.112]  That's where you're alive.
[00:53:22.112 --> 00:53:23.693]  Both my grandfathers, the Army Air Corps,
[00:53:24.389 --> 00:53:27.632]  In the World War II, they were in the Suicide Squad too, but they barely lived.
[00:53:27.632 --> 00:53:28.293]  So I could be here.
[00:53:28.293 --> 00:53:29.874]  I think God was probably at a hand in that.
[00:53:29.874 --> 00:53:34.018]  But the point is, is that you better get in the Suicide Squad too, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:34.018 --> 00:53:36.099]  And that doesn't mean you gotta go kill people or any of that.
[00:53:36.099 --> 00:53:37.100]  No, we don't want that.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:49.491]  You gotta just stand up and speak out and say no at your church, and on the local radio show, and on AXS TV, and in Congress, and the legislature, and everywhere, and praying, and supporting, and everything you can do!
[00:53:49.491 --> 00:53:51.213]  Because it's all coming down
[00:53:52.153 --> 00:53:55.615]  To brass tacks right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:55.615 --> 00:54:07.780]  I mean, they started putting signs on buses and billboards in Europe, the UK and the US and Canada six months ago before they approved it in five-year-olds and up, saying kids have strokes and heart attacks too.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.941]  What the hell do you think's going on here?
[00:54:15.427 --> 00:54:17.388]  My drive and desire is to stay on air.
[00:54:17.388 --> 00:54:20.310]  My drive and desire is to stay in this fight as long as possible.
[00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:23.432]  And God's going to work through you to decide if we do that or not.
[00:54:23.432 --> 00:54:25.193]  But I'm telling you, I need your funds.
[00:54:25.193 --> 00:54:26.334]  I need your prayers.
[00:54:26.334 --> 00:54:30.276]  I need your word of mouth, just like you need as well at Symbiotic.
[00:54:30.276 --> 00:54:31.997]  So go to infowarestore.com.
[00:54:31.997 --> 00:54:33.098]  Do your Christmas shopping there.
[00:54:33.098 --> 00:54:35.599]  There's still plenty of time to get your orders in and get it by Christmas.
[00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:43.404]  We've got shortwave radios that are $16 that work amazingly that we make $7 on.
[00:54:46.894 --> 00:54:48.595]  Look at that little beauty on there.
[00:54:48.595 --> 00:54:57.397]  We have a digital one that is the equivalent of a thousand dollar shortwave radio twenty years ago because of miniaturization for a hundred and something bucks.
[00:54:57.397 --> 00:55:01.659]  But that little silver one you see is sixteen dollars.
[00:55:01.659 --> 00:55:05.820]  It was a hundred bucks a couple years ago but everything's miniaturized, everything's getting cheaper.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.941]  We've got those at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:07.941 --> 00:55:14.523]  AM, FM, shortwave, emergency radios for as low as sixteen dollars and they work great.
[00:55:14.523 --> 00:55:15.263]  We've also got
[00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:20.021]  A couple hundred of the coins left because they held back more than I had told them to.
[00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:20.682]  The crew's great.
[00:55:20.682 --> 00:55:21.042]  I love them.
[00:55:21.042 --> 00:55:23.824]  They just held back 500 coins instead of 100.
[00:55:23.824 --> 00:55:25.405]  We don't need to hold back more than 100.
[00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:26.686]  We won't have that much problem with shipping.
[00:55:26.686 --> 00:55:28.867]  Everybody's basically had their coins shipped out.
[00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.648]  They're sold out.
[00:55:30.648 --> 00:55:32.710]  But now we learned we had an extra 400.
[00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.031]  So those will sell out very soon.
[00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:38.714]  1776coin.com, your last chance to get this historic coin.
[00:55:38.714 --> 00:55:41.736]  1776coin.com or infowarrestore.com.
[00:55:41.736 --> 00:55:45.518]  And again, it has a big markup on it because it's funding the next level of revolution.
[00:55:45.518 --> 00:55:46.279]  It's a war bond.
[00:55:47.335 --> 00:55:53.381]  You spend thousands of bucks on NFL tickets, thousands of bucks on rock and roll and country tickets, and I get it, I'm not blaming you.
[00:55:53.381 --> 00:56:02.409]  But hell, you could spend 130 bucks, 129 bucks, to buy a historic coin that says Founder on it, that's funding us staying on the air and launching a bunch of new operations.
[00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:03.911]  It's at infowarestore.com.
[00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:08.555]  Okay, I didn't get to Dr. McCullough.
[00:56:10.942 --> 00:56:12.904]  But we'll come back next hour and get to it.
[00:56:12.904 --> 00:56:14.885]  I mean, this is a powerful interview.
[00:56:14.885 --> 00:56:26.694]  I've got nine excerpts I'm going to be airing here that you need to get, you need to look into, you need to share, because this guy's a prestigious heart surgeon and research scientist that's run FDA major programs.
[00:56:26.694 --> 00:56:34.140]  And they are crapping their britches that he's awake, and they're crapping their britches that he's there, and they have come after him and everything else.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.202]  He doesn't want to talk about it on air, because I get it.
[00:56:36.202 --> 00:56:38.524]  It's not that he's embarrassed or even scared.
[00:56:38.524 --> 00:56:39.945]  He doesn't want that distraction.
[00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:45.443]  But I love the fact that the more they mess with him... God, he was telling me all the stuff behind the scenes they've done to him.
[00:56:45.443 --> 00:56:49.505]  That just pissed him off ten times worse!
[00:56:49.505 --> 00:56:50.946]  Same thing with us, man.
[00:56:50.946 --> 00:56:52.187]  We're not backing down.
[00:56:52.187 --> 00:56:54.688]  You people want to fight?
[00:56:54.688 --> 00:56:59.571]  You better believe you got one, and it's an information war, and it's a spirit war, and it's a financial war.
[00:56:59.571 --> 00:57:02.072]  So support our local AM and FM stations.
[00:57:02.072 --> 00:57:05.894]  Tithe to those stations that have this show and other shows on like them.
[00:57:05.894 --> 00:57:07.134]  We're fighting for pro-life.
[00:57:07.134 --> 00:57:08.275]  We're fighting for Christ.
[00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:09.996]  We're actually saving souls thanks to God.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.142]  Divine intervention, but these stations need your support.
[00:57:18.142 --> 00:57:19.783]  They're doing way more than your local church.
[00:57:19.783 --> 00:57:22.724]  I'm sorry, unless you've got a rare church that's actually doing their job.
[00:57:22.724 --> 00:57:28.627]  These radio stations are literally basically all we've got left, so you better support them as well.
[00:57:28.627 --> 00:57:30.087]  Give them a donation.
[00:57:30.087 --> 00:57:31.808]  It's so important.
[00:57:31.808 --> 00:57:33.549]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:42.543]  With our number two with Dr. Peter McCullough and the Joe Rogan mega bombshell interview that's going to be his biggest ever and so much more.
[00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:43.583]  Hallelujah.

[00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:53.456]  This is a great sponsor.
[00:58:53.456 --> 00:58:58.880]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.

[00:59:07.907 --> 00:59:09.809]  Infowarsphone.com.
[00:59:09.809 --> 00:59:11.310]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:14.192]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.
[00:59:14.192 --> 00:59:21.538]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone at $650 value, absolutely free, at Infowarsphone.com.
[00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:24.539]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[00:59:24.539 --> 00:59:24.999]  These aren't.
[00:59:24.999 --> 00:59:26.980]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.841]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[00:59:30.841 --> 00:59:31.761]  150 minutes.
[00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:32.942]  So, the calls you were free.
[00:59:32.942 --> 00:59:34.082]  Works like a regular cell phone.
[00:59:34.082 --> 00:59:35.403]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[00:59:35.403 --> 00:59:36.683]  And I keep one in my car.
[00:59:36.683 --> 00:59:38.544]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[00:59:38.544 --> 00:59:40.924]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[00:59:40.924 --> 00:59:41.925]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[00:59:41.925 --> 00:59:43.025]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[00:59:51.351 --> 00:59:55.973]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.973 --> 01:00:01.016]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.016 --> 01:00:03.437]  ...filled with nice people, which it still is.
[01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:06.398]  It's almost beyond conception what is happening there right now.
[01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:14.122]  For example, an Australian woman called Hayley Hodgson just spent two weeks in a coronavirus internment camp in Howard Spring, Australia.
[01:00:14.122 --> 01:00:15.883]  Oh, there are no internment camps in Australia.
[01:00:15.883 --> 01:00:16.883]  Yes, there are.
[01:00:16.883 --> 01:00:18.284]  Listen to her describe her experience.
[01:00:19.389 --> 01:00:21.570]  You feel like you're in prison.
[01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.651]  You feel like you've done something wrong.
[01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:26.192]  It's inhumane what they're doing.
[01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:27.593]  You are so small.
[01:00:27.593 --> 01:00:31.475]  They just overpower you and you're literally nothing.
[01:00:31.475 --> 01:00:36.137]  So because I was so distressed and I said, can you just please let me out for a walk or a run?
[01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:38.858]  I'm in this little box and I move.
[01:00:39.498 --> 01:00:51.023]  Can I please, you know, I'm anxious, I'm feeling not well, just I need to get out and they literally said we've got a doctor calling you and we'll get some Valium prescribed to you that you can call us anytime you like and you can have Valium.
[01:00:52.051 --> 01:00:55.293]  Yeah, here's some Soma, just medicated away.
[01:00:55.293 --> 01:00:59.436]  So this is happening to a lot of people in Australia, and not just the powerless.
[01:00:59.436 --> 01:01:09.363]  An Australian senator who has been critical of COVID restrictions was recently forced into a quarantine camp despite testing negative for COVID repeatedly.
[01:01:09.363 --> 01:01:16.348]  And now the government of Australia, which he has criticized, just sent him a $4,000 bill while he's in detention.
[01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:18.542]  Hard to believe it's real, but it is.
[01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:20.364]  That's Senator Alex Antic, joins us now.
[01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:24.347]  Mr. Antic, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:32.094]  Again, everything about this is impossible to believe, given the very warm and positive feelings most Americans, including me, have for your country.
[01:01:32.094 --> 01:01:33.395]  Are we overstating any of this?
[01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:38.509]  Well, the only thing that's not right about that so far, Tucker, is that I haven't got the bill yet.
[01:01:38.509 --> 01:01:39.750]  I'm led to believe I will have.
[01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:43.375]  That's written into law here, but that's really a sideline issue here.
[01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:44.676]  No, look, you're not.
[01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:51.365]  I have been concerned about some of the powers that have been gifted to the unelected bureaucracy in this country for a long period of time.
[01:01:51.365 --> 01:01:52.226]  I've spoken about them.
[01:01:52.826 --> 01:02:10.479]  Quite fully, and in fact I've been seeking documentation very recently from local health bureaucrats which were effectively upscaled up to a higher body a week before I was told that upon my return from my job in Canberra, which you'll know is effectively our Washington
[01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:21.947]  I would be asked to come into, or told I should say, to come into a Medi Hotel, which in Australian parlance is a hotel which has been turned into an entertainment facility.
[01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:29.533]  And so, you know, that was completely out of step with other people's experiences, completely out of step with what had been done in my previous trips to Canberra and back.
[01:02:30.233 --> 01:02:41.622]  But here's the kicker and here's the thing that gives away what was going on here, Tucker, is that 10 minutes after I found that information out, I got a call from a journalist who also knew about it, who also knew all the details.
[01:02:41.622 --> 01:02:47.186]  And when I arrived at the airport, there was a camera crew and a photographer and a journalist all there to capture it.
[01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:49.387]  Tucker, the message is real.
[01:02:49.387 --> 01:02:53.290]  If people want to speak out and they can do this to me, they can do it to anyone.
[01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:55.712]  I've never been more concerned about the things that are going on in this country.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.401]  Well, it's just absolutely beyond belief.
[01:02:58.401 --> 01:03:03.802]  I mean, if you're forcing someone who, but you don't have COVID and you've been tested multiple times, as I understand, right?
[01:03:03.802 --> 01:03:19.307]  If you can force an opposition politician into an internment camp for no real reason, then I mean, I, you know, I don't want to attack Australia, which again, everyone in America loves, but that's not the way we understand democracy at all.
[01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:26.412]  No, and just to correct that, I'm actually a member of the government, both the state and the federal government.
[01:03:26.412 --> 01:03:29.635]  I meant to say someone who has criticized the policies, which obviously you have.
[01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:31.476]  You're quite right, I have.
[01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:35.099]  And the issue is this, Tucker, and this is the lesson for the United States.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.663]  Parliaments all over the country in Australia have gifted unrivalled powers to their bureaucrats.
[01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:46.725]  And they did so on the basis that we were told there was two weeks to flatten the curve.
[01:03:46.725 --> 01:03:51.688]  They never did so on the basis that there were going to be two years to keep people locked down and mandate vaccinations.
[01:03:52.749 --> 01:04:00.515]  The bureaucrats, everywhere across the world, but certainly in Australia it's true, they never like to get out of the warm bed of power and coercive control.
[01:04:00.515 --> 01:04:05.138]  They won't do it here, and I tell you, they are holding on for dear life.
[01:04:05.138 --> 01:04:20.090]  It is here, across the country, you would have seen the pictures, your viewers would have seen the pictures coming out of Victoria, where the police there have been using strike-breaking tactics against children, against old women, against the populace generally, and the Parliament over there has just
[01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:20.790]  Thank you.
[01:04:41.954 --> 01:04:52.698]  It is literally madness, and I'm not even sure if you're aware of this, but so many people are denying this is happening or making excuses for it that we're just very grateful, Alex Antic, that you were here with us tonight.
[01:04:52.698 --> 01:04:54.158]  South Australia Senator Alex Antic.
[01:04:54.158 --> 01:04:54.818]  God bless you.
[01:04:54.818 --> 01:04:55.578]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.578 --> 01:04:56.059]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.544 --> 01:04:59.865]  Everything I do.
[01:04:59.865 --> 01:05:07.049]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free from it.
[01:05:07.049 --> 01:05:09.730]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:25.139]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the Great Reset and want a one world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[01:05:25.139 --> 01:05:27.080]  After decades of intense research,
[01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:34.038]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[01:05:34.038 --> 01:05:36.999]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.860]  Start your journey at ResetWars.com today.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.902]  We're programming our very subconscious and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control.
[01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:49.303]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[01:05:49.303 --> 01:05:53.905]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at ResetWars.com.
[01:05:53.905 --> 01:05:54.745]  Please join me there.
[01:06:02.077 --> 01:06:03.798]  Big Brother.
[01:06:03.798 --> 01:06:06.100]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.881]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.963]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:12.124]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:12.124 --> 01:06:16.807]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:49.142]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, hour number two, broadcasting worldwide from our Rebel Fortress in Central Texas, formerly Austin, now captured by the Californians, who aren't really Californians, they're the same people that captured California, and have now marched into our state to take it over for their Lord and Savior, George Soros and his daddy, Satan.
[01:06:49.142 --> 01:06:51.043]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.041]  And there's so much to cover.
[01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.582]  There's so much to go over today.
[01:06:54.582 --> 01:06:57.104]  There's so much to break down.
[01:06:57.104 --> 01:07:00.566]  But I want to open the phones up today.
[01:07:00.566 --> 01:07:04.088]  I had a great guest book today, but that guest is not going to be here.
[01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:18.378]  So we can take your phone calls starting at about 45 after this hour, throughout the third hour, your take, your view on the martial law, on the COVID dictatorships, on Joe Biden on 328 days out from the midterms.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:25.783]  And what you see them up to and what you think they're going to pull.
[01:07:25.783 --> 01:07:31.067]  So at the bottom of the hour, I will give the number out.
[01:07:31.067 --> 01:07:33.888]  Everybody knows I like to talk.
[01:07:33.888 --> 01:07:44.235]  But today you've been hearing and seeing me play a lot of clips because so many big heavyweights in science and the medical system are coming right out and saying, OK, it's all staged.
[01:07:44.235 --> 01:07:45.116]  It's depopulation.
[01:07:45.116 --> 01:07:46.156]  It's world government.
[01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:46.797]  It's on purpose.
[01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:48.798]  They want you to die.
[01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.099]  They want to normalize killing you.
[01:07:50.874 --> 01:07:54.595]  This is a psychological warfare operation.
[01:07:54.595 --> 01:08:03.639]  So let me hit these headlines and then I'm going to get to excerpts of Dr. Peter McCullough on the super viral interview with Joe Rogan that was taped last week.
[01:08:03.639 --> 01:08:08.700]  Joe thought whatever the next day, but for some reason it waited a while and just went out a few days ago.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:15.943]  So, inventor of mRNA vaccines warrants parents, jabs could permanently damage children's critical organs.
[01:08:18.124 --> 01:08:26.291]  FDA, CDC backed boosters for minors after conducting zero testing on boosters for minors when their own board said don't do it.
[01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:27.091]  Unvaxed U.S.
[01:08:27.091 --> 01:08:31.175]  Google employees set to lose pay and get fired.
[01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:33.596]  Report now confirmed by the FDA.
[01:08:33.596 --> 01:08:35.858]  FDA colludes with U.S.
[01:08:35.858 --> 01:08:45.366]  Postal Service not to stop fentanyl, that's fine, but to stop totally legal, totally lawful, and totally healthy ivermectin shipments from doctors to their patients.
[01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:50.313]  Fauci admits that COVID vaccine could actually make people sick with A.D.E.
[01:08:50.313 --> 01:08:50.874]  a year ago.
[01:08:50.874 --> 01:08:52.996]  Now it's happening.
[01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:57.962]  Third pro football player in a week experiences severe chest pain during game.
[01:08:57.962 --> 01:09:05.610]  Breaking, Sergio Aguero, one of the top stars in the world, has announced his retirement after the Pfizer shot from myocarditis.
[01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:06.171]  Won't go away.
[01:09:07.714 --> 01:09:09.716]  The London Guardian says, get used to it.
[01:09:09.716 --> 01:09:13.799]  Working from home may be for life, not just Christmas.
[01:09:13.799 --> 01:09:21.965]  Oh, again, the worst part about the first 15 days, the 15 days to flatten the curve, is the first two years.
[01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:23.706]  Now we're in the third year.
[01:09:23.706 --> 01:09:29.390]  So that joke meme I put out almost two years ago is now not a joke anymore, it was a prediction.
[01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.693]  Video, Biden asks, what's the big deal about vaccine mandates?
[01:09:32.693 --> 01:09:35.215]  Says it's patriotic to take the COVID jabs.
[01:09:36.775 --> 01:09:37.255]  Video.
[01:09:37.255 --> 01:09:41.117]  German Chancellor says there will be no red lines as regards to COVID restrictions.
[01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:45.400]  He says forced inoculations start in February.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.761]  And they're going to start imprisoning those that don't take the shots.
[01:09:47.761 --> 01:09:50.462]  That's all UN-run, total world government.
[01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:54.925]  Now I want to show you some of these graphs and statistics that are from governments.
[01:09:54.925 --> 01:09:56.365]  They're not even denying this.
[01:09:56.365 --> 01:09:57.166]  They're just bearing it.
[01:09:57.166 --> 01:10:00.788]  Kind of like the FDA tried to block the release of their own FDA documents.
[01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:05.749]  From Pfizer, and the judge said, well, just release the first few documents.
[01:10:05.749 --> 01:10:09.112]  Thousands of deaths, miscarriages, cover-ups.
[01:10:09.112 --> 01:10:10.073]  I mean, just incredible.
[01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:14.276]  So, Germans are funny, says Lilith of Assyria on Twitter.
[01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:16.298]  You can click through the German government.
[01:10:16.298 --> 01:10:26.646]  COVID-19 proportional vaccine adoption and connected to death and illnesses and all the rest of it.
[01:10:26.646 --> 01:10:27.667]  And you see, it's incredible.
[01:10:28.843 --> 01:10:33.187]  You start the first shot, and it follows the exact amount of people sick.
[01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:34.107]  Start the second shot.
[01:10:34.107 --> 01:10:37.950]  Third shot, even worse, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:42.354]  Exclusive, Dan Andrews is ordered to front court for
[01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:55.633]  Concealing treason and fraud, an extraordinary win by anti-lockdown commissioners in Australia who convinced a Bush court to accept a private prosecution.
[01:10:55.633 --> 01:11:01.257]  Long story short, they've all gotten money from Pfizer and Moderna to set up martial law and do the forced inoculations.
[01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.098]  He's gotten caught in that and now it's gone to court.
[01:11:04.098 --> 01:11:06.740]  That's the Daily Mail that is reporting on that.
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.981]  Here's the actual article.
[01:11:07.981 --> 01:11:11.643]  Dan Andrews goes on leave after being ordered to front court for
[01:11:12.662 --> 01:11:14.823]  Concealing treason and fraud.
[01:11:14.823 --> 01:11:17.145]  Hmm.
[01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:20.307]  Here's another article out of the Telegraph of Australia.
[01:11:20.307 --> 01:11:28.913]  The Omicron epidemic is being driven by young, vaccinated people, according to monitoring data from countries as diverse as UK, Denmark, and South Africa.
[01:11:28.913 --> 01:11:29.553]  Funny!
[01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:33.216]  It's people that have had the shot that are now sick!
[01:11:33.216 --> 01:11:35.497]  Oh my gosh!
[01:11:35.497 --> 01:11:36.458]  Who could have predicted it?
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.063]  Expert reveals who is spreading Omicron variant of the COVID-19.
[01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.164]  News.com.au.
[01:11:43.164 --> 01:11:47.086]  There it is for you.
[01:11:47.086 --> 01:11:49.828]  Deaths now to increase in New York City as well.
[01:11:49.828 --> 01:11:52.470]  As the vaccines go up, the death rates increase.
[01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:54.599]  Here's another one.
[01:11:54.599 --> 01:11:59.122]  Cases growing exponentially, rapidly in New York City.
[01:11:59.122 --> 01:12:03.665]  More than doubled in the last two weeks as the booster shots begin.
[01:12:03.665 --> 01:12:05.246]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:12:05.246 --> 01:12:07.247]  You see that same graph.
[01:12:07.247 --> 01:12:09.268]  We've shown that graph from a few months ago over and over again.
[01:12:09.268 --> 01:12:17.673]  90 country graph where it shows right when the shots start, right when the injections begin, right here at the bottom.
[01:12:17.673 --> 01:12:19.214]  Well, then it just goes right back up.
[01:12:21.457 --> 01:12:23.558]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:12:23.558 --> 01:12:24.178]  Here's another one.
[01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:32.543]  Two weeks ago, the UK reinstated mass mandates in many settings, despite them already failing to prevent multiple surges.
[01:12:32.543 --> 01:12:39.626]  Somehow, despite doing what we know works, close quote, cases are still rising and rapidly approaching a new high.
[01:12:39.626 --> 01:12:44.469]  Funny, every time you take a shot, that's when it increases.
[01:12:44.469 --> 01:12:45.189]  Take a shot.
[01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:47.090]  Take a shot.
[01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:48.291]  Take a shot.
[01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:48.731]  Look at that.
[01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:53.911]  That's what the shots do for you.
[01:12:53.911 --> 01:13:05.342]  It's like, you're not a pathologist, how do you know if you shoot somebody in the head with a double-awk buckshot at point-blank range and blow their brains all over the wall, how do you know that person's dead?
[01:13:05.342 --> 01:13:10.608]  Well, I'm not a doctor, but the blood stopped pumping out of the arteries and veins, and I can take their pulse, there's no pulse.
[01:13:11.966 --> 01:13:12.967]  Well, you're not a doctor.
[01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:13.868]  I mean, how do you know?
[01:13:13.868 --> 01:13:19.372]  Well, every time they give the shots here, the cases of illnesses, hospitalizations, and death skyrocket.
[01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:22.334]  I mean, hell, ain't gotta be a rocket science to figure that out.
[01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:24.756]  You're like, you're not a pathologist.
[01:13:24.756 --> 01:13:31.521]  Well, if I walk over and start hacking, hypothetically I wouldn't do this, the camera operator, the boom operator, with a hatchet.
[01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:37.591]  And blood spraying out, and you know, I cut his head off on TV and hold it up, and like, how do we know he's dead?
[01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:39.131]  Well, his head's cut off.
[01:13:39.131 --> 01:13:40.791]  Well, you're not a scientist.
[01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.732]  Hell, even if you're a scientist, you say that you can't.
[01:13:42.732 --> 01:13:46.133]  Only the UN can make scientific studies.
[01:13:46.133 --> 01:13:47.213]  But it gets better.
[01:13:47.213 --> 01:13:52.115]  Flight attendants blame airport drinking for stoking mask anger.
[01:13:52.115 --> 01:13:56.816]  That's right, people aren't just mad at the mask and they have the control, uh, stewardesses.
[01:13:56.816 --> 01:13:59.217]  They are completely pissed off and upset
[01:14:00.615 --> 01:14:01.976]  Because of drinking, yes.
[01:14:01.976 --> 01:14:05.839]  And now a lot of airlines and governments are banning alcohol in Europe.
[01:14:05.839 --> 01:14:07.380]  Now the new lockdowns.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.441]  Oh, you won't take the shot?
[01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:10.822]  Well, you can't have your alcohol now.
[01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:16.606]  They really want you to take that shot because they care about you, even though all the different globalists say they want to depopulate you.
[01:14:16.606 --> 01:14:18.208]  Yes, I want to kill you, but please take this.
[01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:18.708]  I want you to live.
[01:14:20.615 --> 01:14:25.178]  Continuing, vaccine prevents severe disease, they say.
[01:14:25.178 --> 01:14:37.948]  But all over the world, in the most vaccinated states, 85% of adults vaccinated in the USA are seeing record COVID hospitalizations currently, way higher than last year.
[01:14:37.948 --> 01:14:39.589]  Wow, so does the vaccine work?
[01:14:39.589 --> 01:14:41.330]  Yeah, it makes you sick and kills you.
[01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:43.952]  It works damn well.
[01:14:43.952 --> 01:14:45.213]  Just not the way they said it did.
[01:14:47.105 --> 01:14:51.447]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[01:14:51.447 --> 01:14:55.548]  But Biden suggests his Build Back Better legislation would have prevented deadly tornadoes.
[01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:56.408]  I'll get to that later.
[01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.169]  I propose a way to deal with it.
[01:14:58.169 --> 01:14:59.529]  Taxes and money to them.
[01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:01.410]  Oh, but don't worry, it gets better.
[01:15:02.168 --> 01:15:11.532]  In the UK, in Australia, in everywhere, COVID passports not expected to apply to members of Parliament in the Commons and speaker announces.
[01:15:11.532 --> 01:15:15.774]  Oh, the government officials and the media people, they're all exempt.
[01:15:15.774 --> 01:15:16.955]  Wow.
[01:15:16.955 --> 01:15:18.936]  Ruling elite using this to control you.
[01:15:18.936 --> 01:15:19.956]  They're exempt.
[01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:21.837]  Imagine my shock.
[01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:23.338]  To quote Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:15:23.338 --> 01:15:23.938]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:34.023]  We're going to come back with Dr. Peter McCullough and Joe Rogan and we've gone in very judiciously, very smartly in a three hour interview and cut it down to about 14 minutes.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.421]  The most juicy, important parts.
[01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:37.821]  Straight ahead.
[01:15:37.821 --> 01:15:39.281]  And then, your phone calls.
[01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:42.002]  Toll free number to join us on air.

[01:15:42.623 --> 01:15:42.763]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:42.763 --> 01:15:44.623]  Don't forget, Reset Wars is now live.

[01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:46.084]  ResetWars.com.
[01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:47.744]  This could be InfoWars last Christmas.
[01:16:03.499 --> 01:16:06.260]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.261]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:12.922]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[01:16:12.922 --> 01:16:14.243]  They're coming after us.
[01:16:14.243 --> 01:16:22.686]  And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent media, in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms of 2022.
[01:16:22.686 --> 01:16:24.046]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[01:16:28.348 --> 01:16:30.229]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:35.911]  I want to encourage you to do your Christmas shopping in FullerStore.com, because I can barely keep our operation going.
[01:16:35.911 --> 01:16:39.093]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.
[01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:40.493]  I am so thankful for you.
[01:16:40.493 --> 01:16:48.477]  And I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us, and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on.
[01:16:48.857 --> 01:16:55.939]  InfoWarStore.com has incredible products, storewide free shipping up until December 20th.
[01:16:55.939 --> 01:16:58.180]  So please take action now and keep us on the air.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:58.980]  Thank you.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.300]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.341]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[01:17:02.341 --> 01:17:02.761]  Welcome.
[01:17:02.761 --> 01:17:03.481]  Hello, Alex.
[01:17:03.481 --> 01:17:04.042]  Yes, Malcolm.
[01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:04.442]  All right.
[01:17:04.442 --> 01:17:08.583]  I'll make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:12.944]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[01:17:12.944 --> 01:17:15.925]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:18.566]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:20.628]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[01:17:20.628 --> 01:17:25.511]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[01:17:25.511 --> 01:17:32.296]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[01:17:32.296 --> 01:17:34.138]  This is like a very fine wine.
[01:17:34.138 --> 01:17:36.279]  In fact, each batch is different.
[01:17:36.279 --> 01:17:38.721]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:41.984]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[01:17:41.984 --> 01:17:42.924]  That's just how it is.
[01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:43.585]  It's how it works.
[01:17:44.306 --> 01:17:48.317]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[01:17:48.317 --> 01:17:52.127]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[01:17:59.224 --> 01:18:01.986]  Ultimate Bone Broth is back and better than ever.
[01:18:01.986 --> 01:18:06.630]  And 20% off, plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:10.954]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever.
[01:18:10.954 --> 01:18:13.756]  And it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:15.638]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[01:18:16.298 --> 01:18:25.305]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[01:18:25.305 --> 01:18:28.948]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[01:18:28.948 --> 01:18:35.492]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[01:18:35.492 --> 01:18:37.434]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[01:18:37.434 --> 01:18:39.896]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[01:18:39.896 --> 01:18:44.479]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein isolate package.
[01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:48.022]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[01:18:48.022 --> 01:18:48.803]  I like going to concerts.
[01:18:48.803 --> 01:18:49.823]  I like going to play golf.
[01:18:49.823 --> 01:18:51.445]  I like going out to dinner.
[01:19:07.858 --> 01:19:09.760]  I like the metropolitan life.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.801]  I like everything that comes with this.
[01:19:11.801 --> 01:19:17.845]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities.
[01:19:17.845 --> 01:19:20.607]  Get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[01:19:20.607 --> 01:19:24.129]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[01:19:24.129 --> 01:19:25.930]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:28.052]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[01:19:28.052 --> 01:19:28.992]  Just get off-grid?
[01:19:28.992 --> 01:19:30.453]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[01:19:30.453 --> 01:19:31.574]  Just live off the land?
[01:19:31.574 --> 01:19:32.955]  That's the survival instinct.
[01:19:32.955 --> 01:19:37.238]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:38.740]  Stay in the city.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:43.765]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere that ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[01:19:43.765 --> 01:19:50.233]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:54.998]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:56.680]  And so we have the best ones at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:01.132 --> 01:20:05.734]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:07.054]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.054 --> 01:20:12.716]  I remember, at thirteen years old,
[01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:39.294]  Well, my uncle was sitting there in his garage in San Antonio, Texas, working on a car engine.
[01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:41.615]  And I said, I'm a Republican.
[01:20:41.615 --> 01:20:44.397]  I like the Republican party.
[01:20:44.397 --> 01:20:50.160]  And he turned around and looked at me and he said, here, go get yourself a soft drink out of the refrigerator.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.201]  And let's sit down here in the backyard and let's talk a few minutes.
[01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:53.142]  He had grease all over him.
[01:20:53.142 --> 01:20:57.084]  And he sat down for about two hours and told me how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:09.665]  He didn't really tell me anything secret, but he told me a lot, and it sounded crazy when I was hearing it.
[01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:15.888]  But you know, it was all true.
[01:21:15.888 --> 01:21:19.289]  And he got a lot of silver stars in Vietnam.
[01:21:19.289 --> 01:21:20.230]  He was a great patriot.
[01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:26.353]  He thought he was working for the government, thought he was saving America, thought he was a good guy until he actually got in the middle of it and found out what was really going on.
[01:21:28.723 --> 01:21:48.696]  And you know, all of us are at that point now, whether we worked for the CIA, or whether you worked for the Army, or whether you were a school teacher, or whether you worked for the FBI, or whether you work in a prison, or whether you work at a grocery store or a farmer, we're all in this thing now, and people better wake up and realize how much damn danger we're in.
[01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:53.139]  That's why I get so pissed when callers call in who are great people and say, you're such a hero.
[01:21:53.139 --> 01:21:55.701]  I'm a hero not signing on to pedophilia and Satanism?
[01:21:56.772 --> 01:21:58.994]  Well, if that's heroes, then we got a problem.
[01:21:58.994 --> 01:22:00.995]  How about I'm not doing that?
[01:22:00.995 --> 01:22:02.937]  How about I can't be part of that?
[01:22:02.937 --> 01:22:10.463]  How about we all decide we're not living like this?
[01:22:10.463 --> 01:22:18.889]  And here we are, inside the New World Order, where every day we're on air is incredibly precious.
[01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:20.370]  We could be taken off the air any time.
[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:21.912]  That means all of you at the same time.
[01:22:21.912 --> 01:22:25.955]  I mean, I'm going to get these clips and then your calls, but let me explain where I'm coming from.
[01:22:28.639 --> 01:22:36.946]  I knew last year, six months before, that they were going to do the Red Mirage scam because they admitted it.
[01:22:36.946 --> 01:22:41.869]  I know the difference between their propaganda versus their orders going out to their people.
[01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:53.738]  You always, you know, grow up watching movies about spy movies where the Russians or whatever would put like ads of their spies in the newspaper ads.
[01:22:53.738 --> 01:22:54.439]  That actually went on.
[01:22:56.297 --> 01:22:57.838]  But that's what the globalists do.
[01:22:57.838 --> 01:23:03.563]  They sit there and do these drills and have these symposiums and they don't even hide what they're saying at these damn things.
[01:23:03.563 --> 01:23:06.686]  And I'm sitting there watching them prepare this whole plan for us.
[01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:09.028]  It's not the Russians coming after us.
[01:23:09.028 --> 01:23:18.276]  The Chai-coms are just some globalist playland where they can dehumanize whoever they want.
[01:23:18.276 --> 01:23:19.257]  And I'm just sitting here.
[01:23:21.443 --> 01:23:24.564]  Watching them swallow up and destroy the whole country.
[01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:27.705]  And I forget the point I was even going to make getting into that.
[01:23:27.705 --> 01:23:32.146]  It'll come back to my mind in a moment.
[01:23:32.146 --> 01:23:36.387]  But here's what people need to know.
[01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:45.529]  Mass crimes against children are going on, giving them shots that erase their immune systems and create basically an HIV
[01:23:47.137 --> 01:23:49.919]  AIDS type illness in billions of people.
[01:23:49.919 --> 01:23:51.280]  And that's confirmed now.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:59.027]  And blood clots, and cancer, and all these problems.
[01:23:59.027 --> 01:24:03.791]  And we just can't sit here and act like this isn't going on.
[01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:15.460]  So the good news is, the bad news is so horrible with the system going after the children, that massive top scientists,
[01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:23.074]  When I say massive, I mean massive numbers are now going, okay, it's all pre-planned, it's a takeover, it's pure evil, they want to kill you, it's a great reset.
[01:24:23.074 --> 01:24:24.234]  They already all know that.
[01:24:24.234 --> 01:24:28.156]  I mean, you don't just think Alex Jones and millions of you know that, right?
[01:24:28.156 --> 01:24:34.519]  No, they know that.
[01:24:34.519 --> 01:24:36.439]  And so we're living in this.
[01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:37.640]  This is real.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.462]  And if you're freaked out, you should be freaked out.
[01:24:41.462 --> 01:24:42.322]  And if you feel un...
[01:24:43.664 --> 01:24:44.144]  Stable?
[01:24:44.144 --> 01:24:47.085]  You should be, because this is a destabilized time.
[01:24:47.085 --> 01:24:49.506]  You're not supposed to feel normal during something like this.
[01:24:49.506 --> 01:24:58.610]  You're not supposed to be happy going to the movies and going eating your food and going and playing golf or whatever and, you know, polishing your car and playing with your favorite, you know, video games.
[01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:01.931]  That's all fine and dandy if we weren't going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:05.673]  But evil, through the medical system, has made its move.
[01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:08.774]  It's the population move on humanity.
[01:25:08.774 --> 01:25:10.235]  It's here now.
[01:25:14.105 --> 01:25:26.367]  And so, all of you that are upset, and all of you that have anxiety, myself included, it's because we're not doing enough to fight this thing.
[01:25:26.367 --> 01:25:35.529]  And we have a responsibility to fight this thing, and we're not going to feel good and be close to God until we defeat this system.
[01:25:35.529 --> 01:25:37.109]  So let me just start, because I've got to get to these clips.
[01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:41.390]  It's about 12 minutes of them, 15 minutes of them, and then we're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:25:42.213 --> 01:25:45.934]  This is Dr. Peter McCullough on Joe Rogan, clip three.
[01:25:45.934 --> 01:26:02.621]  It seems to me early on there was an intentional, very comprehensive suppression of early treatment all over the world, unified by the UN, in order to promote fear, suffering, isolation, hospitalization, and death.
[01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:05.142]  So, an organized movement to cause death.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:08.281]  Just like Governor Cuomo, all of it.
[01:26:08.281 --> 01:26:09.282]  He was giving orders.
[01:26:09.282 --> 01:26:10.842]  This is real.
[01:26:10.842 --> 01:26:12.023]  This is happening.
[01:26:12.023 --> 01:26:16.285]  Lying to yourself, living in denial, is not going to get you out of this.
[01:26:16.285 --> 01:26:17.826]  Playtime is over, folks.
[01:26:17.826 --> 01:26:18.166]  Here it is.
[01:26:28.151 --> 01:26:42.025]  And it seemed to me, and I've told Tucker Carlson and many others, it seems to me early on there was an intentional, very comprehensive suppression of early treatment in order to promote fear, suffering, isolation, hospitalization, and death.
[01:26:42.025 --> 01:26:49.533]  And it seemed to be completely organized and intentional in order to create acceptance for and then promote mass vaccination.
[01:26:51.525 --> 01:26:55.146]  So you believe this is a premeditated thing that they were doing?
[01:26:55.146 --> 01:27:04.330]  So they realized that in order to get people enthusiastic about taking this vaccine, the best way to do that was to not have a protocol for treatment.
[01:27:05.051 --> 01:27:13.616]  It's not just my idea, now it's completely laid out by the book by Dr. Pam Popper, the book recently published by Peter Bragan, COVID-19 and the Global Predators, We Are the Prey.
[01:27:13.616 --> 01:27:19.339]  I wrote one of the introductions, Dr. Lee Fleet and Dr. Vladimir Zolosenko wrote the other introductions.
[01:27:19.339 --> 01:27:21.940]  These books are basically non-fiction.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:27.683]  They have a thousand citations in the Bragan book showing how it was coordinated and planned.
[01:27:27.683 --> 01:27:33.307]  Now Bobby Kennedy has his book out, the real Anthony Fauci, the most mentioned physician in that book.
[01:27:33.307 --> 01:27:33.847]  I can tell you,
[01:27:34.307 --> 01:27:59.268]  That if you want to find the evidence that Moderna was working on the vaccine before the virus ever emanated out of the lab, if you wanted to find the collusions and the operations between the Gates Foundation and Gavi and Cepi and Pfizer and Moderna and the vaccine manufacturers and the Wuhan lab and the National Institutes of Health and Ralph Baric and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and how all this was organized, if you want to see the Johns Hopkins planning seminar called the SPARS pandemic in 2017,
[01:28:00.409 --> 01:28:01.370]  Where they had a symposium.
[01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:02.171]  People showed up.
[01:28:02.171 --> 01:28:03.792]  They wrote up their symposium findings.
[01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:04.832]  They published this.
[01:28:04.832 --> 01:28:07.494]  It says it's going to be a coronavirus.
[01:28:07.494 --> 01:28:09.576]  It's going to be related to MERS and SARS.
[01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.297]  It's going to come over here to the United States.
[01:28:11.297 --> 01:28:13.719]  It's going to shut down cities and frighten people.
[01:28:13.719 --> 01:28:15.780]  There's going to be confusion regarding a drug.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.141]  Hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin.
[01:28:17.141 --> 01:28:21.244]  And we're going to utilize all that in order to railroad the population into mass vaccination.
[01:28:21.244 --> 01:28:25.127]  It's laid out in the Johns Hopkins Spars Pandemic Training Seminar.
[01:28:25.127 --> 01:28:26.568]  The only thing they got wrong was the year.
[01:28:26.568 --> 01:28:28.289]  They said it was going to be 2025.
[01:28:28.289 --> 01:28:29.470]  Instead it landed a few years early.
[01:28:30.478 --> 01:28:36.243]  Now you saw us almost a year ago break all that down, but now you see it externalized to the general population of the mass.
[01:28:36.243 --> 01:28:39.086]  This is what your support and prayer and word of mouth has done.
[01:28:39.086 --> 01:28:40.467]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:41.868]  You are changing the world.
[01:28:41.868 --> 01:28:43.590]  You are the resistance.
[01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:44.511]  You are the heroes.
[01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:46.773]  So thank you all for what you've done.
[01:28:46.773 --> 01:28:49.215]  More of Dr. Peter McCullough and Joe Rogan straight ahead.
[01:28:49.215 --> 01:28:51.737]  But please, go join ResetWars.com right now.
[01:28:51.737 --> 01:28:54.399]  The course is live, 25% off right now.
[01:28:54.399 --> 01:28:55.080]  Ends at midnight.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:55.841]  Last chance to get it.
[01:28:58.815 --> 01:29:02.545]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[01:29:02.545 --> 01:29:07.599]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering
[01:29:08.404 --> 01:29:10.566]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[01:29:10.566 --> 01:29:25.838]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:28.060]  It is the true digital economy.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:32.283]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind in transcending their control.
[01:29:33.224 --> 01:29:41.267]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[01:29:41.267 --> 01:29:47.210]  But I gotta tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available.
[01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:51.871]  Now, the month of December 2021 is here at ResetWars.com.
[01:29:51.871 --> 01:29:56.033]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[01:29:56.033 --> 01:29:58.334]  The globalists fear this information.
[01:29:59.042 --> 01:30:05.667]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free from it.
[01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:08.349]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[01:30:08.349 --> 01:30:23.759]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the Great Reset and want a one world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[01:30:23.759 --> 01:30:25.721]  After decades of intense research,
[01:30:27.034 --> 01:30:32.676]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[01:30:32.676 --> 01:30:35.617]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[01:30:35.617 --> 01:30:39.458]  Start your journey at ResetWars.com today.
[01:30:39.458 --> 01:30:45.520]  They're programming our very subconscious and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.921]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[01:30:47.921 --> 01:30:52.523]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at ResetWars.com.
[01:30:52.523 --> 01:30:53.363]  Please join me there.
[01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:04.543]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:13.926]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[01:31:14.566 --> 01:31:24.536]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[01:31:24.536 --> 01:31:31.322]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[01:31:31.322 --> 01:31:32.743]  But there is only two things to do.
[01:31:33.864 --> 01:31:37.007]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[01:31:37.007 --> 01:31:40.310]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:45.715]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[01:31:45.715 --> 01:31:47.536]  And so, we must prepare.
[01:31:47.536 --> 01:31:58.786]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:58.786 --> 01:31:59.587]  Alright ladies and gentlemen,
[01:32:01.018 --> 01:32:02.438]  Keep us on air.
[01:32:02.438 --> 01:32:04.979]  We'll continue to bring you the banned guests.
[01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:08.839]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[01:32:08.839 --> 01:32:09.600]  Keep us on air.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.880]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:24.442]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the InfoWars Life Supplement line, the Vitamin D3 with Calcium Gummies, the Vitamin C with Zinc, and the Whole Food Multivitamins, or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:24.442 --> 01:32:26.903]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D Gummies,
[01:32:27.947 --> 01:32:29.709]  This is a great thing for your kids.
[01:32:29.709 --> 01:32:30.410]  They're going to love it.
[01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:32.112]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[01:32:32.112 --> 01:32:33.514]  It's healthy.
[01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.016]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.598]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[01:32:36.598 --> 01:32:38.761]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:39.682]  Calcium, good for them.
[01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:40.163]  The vitamin D.

[01:33:15.436 --> 01:33:17.657]  Science horror.
[01:33:17.657 --> 01:33:19.239]  Vaccine spike protein.
[01:33:19.239 --> 01:33:22.501]  Tons of inner cell nuclei.
[01:33:22.501 --> 01:33:25.163]  Suppresses DNA repair engine of the human body.
[01:33:27.011 --> 01:33:37.081]  We'll unleash explosion of cancer, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disorders, and accelerating aging.
[01:33:37.081 --> 01:33:41.705]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:41.705 --> 01:33:47.771]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:55.089 --> 01:33:59.572]  Alright, we're playing clips of Dr. Peter McCullough on my good friend Joe Rogan's transmission.
[01:33:59.572 --> 01:34:04.554]  Told you a year and a half ago, Joe was moving to Austin, broke it here.
[01:34:04.554 --> 01:34:05.555]  Over a year and a half ago now.
[01:34:05.555 --> 01:34:08.476]  Told you he was going to get hardcore once he had control of his show.
[01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.638]  Told you he was totally awake.
[01:34:10.638 --> 01:34:16.141]  Before, he was a smart guy and knew I was right about a lot of stuff, but he thought there were a lot of good elites that didn't mean all this bad.
[01:34:16.141 --> 01:34:17.281]  Now he knows.
[01:34:17.281 --> 01:34:22.324]  Now he's in bear on its hind legs mode.
[01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:23.745]  And I just told you, I didn't lie to you again.
[01:34:24.363 --> 01:34:25.864]  A year and a half ago, listeners were so pissed.
[01:34:25.864 --> 01:34:29.267]  Joe Rogan, screw him!
[01:34:29.267 --> 01:34:29.567]  Now?
[01:34:29.567 --> 01:34:33.449]  Did I lie to you?
[01:34:33.449 --> 01:34:34.971]  Did I lie to you, baby?
[01:34:34.971 --> 01:34:38.933]  I tell you, honey, did I say something that wasn't true?
[01:34:38.933 --> 01:34:43.297]  I mean, sometimes I make mistakes, but the big main of what I do is the truth.
[01:34:43.297 --> 01:34:48.020]  And again, it's just an example of how we're winning.
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.241]  You're winning.
[01:34:49.241 --> 01:34:52.203]  And yeah, stuff's dark, stuff's bad, stuff's scary, but we're winning.
[01:34:54.241 --> 01:34:55.862]  There's going to be a high body count in this whole deal.
[01:34:55.862 --> 01:34:57.483]  We're trying to save as many children as we can.
[01:34:57.483 --> 01:35:01.225]  So I'll be honest with you.
[01:35:01.225 --> 01:35:04.587]  Adults go along with the system, they get killed, I'm not going to cry.
[01:35:04.587 --> 01:35:10.911]  But children, just like God looks at children as innocent and need to be protected, I'm following God's directive.
[01:35:10.911 --> 01:35:12.913]  You know, God's one trillion G.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:21.263]  Broadcast I'm getting and God just says those are innocent people hadn't made their choices yet You better protect them or I will destroy your ass.
[01:35:21.263 --> 01:35:38.051]  I'm like, yes, sir No matter how many guns the enemy points at me You're nothing compared to what's got the guns pointed me and I and I'm not doing out of fear of God But you you fear the separation from God That's God's biggest threat is I will separate myself from you.
[01:35:38.051 --> 01:35:40.412]  I will leave you and I'm like, no, no, no.
[01:35:40.412 --> 01:35:40.432]  I
[01:35:41.178 --> 01:35:42.639]  Please don't leave me.
[01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:46.583]  Well, if we don't stand up for these children, God is going to leave us.
[01:35:46.583 --> 01:35:56.632]  If we forsake these children, if we don't go to all the damn injection centers, and I told you it happened last weekend.
[01:35:56.632 --> 01:36:01.597]  I was going into a store to buy a new toothbrush and some other, you know, stuff I needed.
[01:36:02.927 --> 01:36:06.531]  I don't know who steals my comb brushes at my house, but they're always disappearing.
[01:36:06.531 --> 01:36:11.436]  So I go into Walgreens every now and then once a month, and I just go back to the area back where they got the combs and toothpaste.
[01:36:11.436 --> 01:36:15.900]  There's like 15 kids of these mothers, all mothers, wearing masks, and the kids all look scared.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.322]  They're injecting them in this little room.
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:24.444]  And I got physically ill because I was realizing you should be boycotting these every weekend.
[01:36:24.444 --> 01:36:26.246]  You should be fighting for them.
[01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:31.170]  You should be... I physically knew they were being given cancer.
[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:32.270]  They were being given blood clots.
[01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:33.531]  They were being given death.
[01:36:33.531 --> 01:36:42.518]  And I was just there nonchalantly getting my natural mouthwash and toothpaste and... Not toothpaste, I already have toothpaste, but the toothbrush I was missing.
[01:36:42.518 --> 01:36:45.260]  And toothpicks, the little toothpicks I use.
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:45.441]  So...
[01:36:46.584 --> 01:36:48.186]  There we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:48.186 --> 01:36:49.928]  That's where we are.
[01:36:49.928 --> 01:36:51.629]  I was also buying some aspirin for my heart.
[01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:56.715]  Now we're getting to where I was buying there, and some toys for my four-year-old daughter, and then some chocolate bars.
[01:36:56.715 --> 01:37:04.443]  But the point is, is that that's what was going on at this place, and you should be sickened by that.
[01:37:04.443 --> 01:37:05.484]  You should be upset by that.
[01:37:05.484 --> 01:37:06.105]  So let's just play.
[01:37:07.006 --> 01:37:07.867]  A bunch of these clips.
[01:37:07.867 --> 01:37:08.628]  Let's just go in order.
[01:37:08.628 --> 01:37:09.549]  I don't know which one's the best.
[01:37:09.549 --> 01:37:10.450]  They're all powerful.
[01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:12.913]  We already played him saying it's all premeditated takeover.
[01:37:12.913 --> 01:37:16.576]  Let's just start with clip 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:37:16.576 --> 01:37:17.317]  Just go right through them.
[01:37:17.317 --> 01:37:17.618]  Here they are.
[01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:39.357]  In Texas, they actually put these parameters on who gets it and who doesn't, and you have to be in a high-risk ethnicity to get it.
[01:37:39.357 --> 01:37:49.605]  A friend of mine went, he had COVID, and he is a healthy Caucasian male in his 30s, and they told him, you are not qualified to receive the monoclonal antibodies.
[01:37:50.485 --> 01:37:59.416]  And the lady who was working there said, if you were another ethnicity, like if you were Hispanic or black, then we would qualify you.
[01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:01.719]  And she was like, look, this is not my idea.
[01:38:01.719 --> 01:38:03.782]  This is, I just have to follow the rules.
[01:38:03.782 --> 01:38:05.784]  Why would anybody establish rules like that?
[01:38:05.784 --> 01:38:06.345]  Like, what is that?
[01:38:06.485 --> 01:38:07.325]  And they're so arbitrary.
[01:38:07.325 --> 01:38:09.546]  From center to center, the arbitrariness of the rules.
[01:38:09.546 --> 01:38:14.648]  I've sent younger patients who have severe symptoms and in trouble for monoclonal antibodies, they've been turned down.
[01:38:14.648 --> 01:38:19.170]  I've had other people go for monoclonal antibodies themselves and get them fine, no difficulty.
[01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:21.011]  Most of the time, I have to say, I've had a great experience.
[01:38:21.011 --> 01:38:23.432]  People have gotten monoclonal antibodies, but I have to tell you an anecdote.
[01:38:23.432 --> 01:38:27.674]  Somebody close in my religious circles developed COVID-19.
[01:38:27.674 --> 01:38:30.435]  And he developed some severe respiratory symptoms.
[01:38:30.435 --> 01:38:33.196]  And I had gotten wind of vaccine discrimination, Joe.
[01:38:34.437 --> 01:38:37.558]  I had gotten wind of this, and this person was not vaccinated.
[01:38:37.558 --> 01:38:39.359]  I said, we're going to go for a monoclonal antibody infusion.
[01:38:39.359 --> 01:38:40.720]  It's late on a Saturday night.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:49.284]  He goes for the monoclonal antibody infusion, and the doctor at the center in Dallas lords over him, arms folded, and says, have you been vaccinated?
[01:38:49.284 --> 01:38:53.406]  And this person looks up at him, and he says, I refuse to answer that question.
[01:38:53.406 --> 01:38:55.647]  And the doctor looked at him, and he said, OK.
[01:38:55.647 --> 01:38:58.109]  And the person who came said, listen, I just want a monoclonal antibody infusion.
[01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.309]  Go home.
[01:38:58.889 --> 01:39:02.374]  He gets the monoclonal antibody infusion and on the way out the door he goes, Hey Doc!
[01:39:02.374 --> 01:39:05.918]  He goes, What if I would have answered that question and told you I was vaccinated?
[01:39:05.918 --> 01:39:08.962]  He goes, Oh, I would have given you remdesivir.
[01:39:08.962 --> 01:39:16.512]  Of the 800,000 deaths that we are right now, I can tell you 201, they've received either no or inadequate early treatment.
[01:39:17.652 --> 01:39:18.813]  All of them.
[01:39:18.813 --> 01:39:26.215]  Go look in a table of baseline characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and look at what they received before they came to the hospital.
[01:39:26.215 --> 01:39:26.795]  Zilch!
[01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:30.456]  In fact, there's one paper by Ip and colleagues, the last name is spelled I-P.
[01:39:30.456 --> 01:39:33.256]  It was published from New Jersey early on.
[01:39:33.256 --> 01:39:42.339]  And in that paper, back when there was a surge of hydroxychloroquine use in the spring of 2020, 7% of people had received some pre-hospital hydroxychloroquine before they got to the hospital.
[01:39:42.819 --> 01:39:44.760]  They had improved survival.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.240]  Even some pre-hospital treatment really worked.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:53.302]  So what happened is when we came up with our treatment protocols, the protocol that I mentioned, it sounds like describing what you received as a treatment.
[01:39:53.302 --> 01:39:54.683]  You basically received the McCullough Protocol.
[01:39:54.683 --> 01:39:55.543]  It's now been copyrighted.
[01:39:55.543 --> 01:39:56.523]  It's a sequence multi-drug.
[01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:58.204]  Once the monoclonal antibodies came in, that became
[01:39:58.564 --> 01:40:03.847]  A building block in our program, and we can maybe show the multi-drug protocol on the screen if we can look at it.
[01:40:03.847 --> 01:40:13.312]  The point is that any pre-hospital treatment was associated with improved survival, because we're taking an edge off viral replication, reducing some of the inflammation, preventing the thrombosis.
[01:40:13.312 --> 01:40:17.414]  If we let this thing run for 14 days, Joe, the lungs are filling with blood clots.
[01:40:17.414 --> 01:40:20.475]  By the time the oxygen saturation goes down, that's not the virus.
[01:40:20.475 --> 01:40:25.858]  The Italians showed us through autopsy studies, very courageous autopsy studies, the lungs are filled with micro blood clots.
[01:40:27.318 --> 01:40:30.740]  The Naval cruise ship, 3,700 individuals, fully vaccinated.
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.661]  They passed a Delta to each other.
[01:40:32.661 --> 01:40:34.142]  Then we have these papers here.
[01:40:34.142 --> 01:40:36.483]  We have one from Haver, CDC COVID Network.
[01:40:36.483 --> 01:40:38.084]  We have Philmar from the VA.
[01:40:38.084 --> 01:40:39.564]  This is data shading into June.
[01:40:39.564 --> 01:40:41.025]  This is before Delta really kicked up.
[01:40:41.025 --> 01:40:45.247]  We had 23% of Americans in the hospital who were vaccinated, but they had COVID-19.
[01:40:45.247 --> 01:40:48.429]  Remember in June, remember that talking point that was issued?
[01:40:48.429 --> 01:40:50.130]  99% of people in the hospital were unvaccinated.
[01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:50.290]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.165 --> 01:40:54.107]  That's propaganda.
[01:40:54.107 --> 01:40:56.830]  That's false information put out by those in position of authority.
[01:40:56.830 --> 01:41:02.155]  There was one time, and I was on Laura Ingraham, and they had a montage of everybody saying 99% unvaccinated.
[01:41:02.155 --> 01:41:03.156]  Even the governor of Florida said that.
[01:41:03.156 --> 01:41:04.758]  President of the United States said that.
[01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:09.943]  That was a false talking point that was issued, and everybody said it.
[01:41:09.943 --> 01:41:13.227]  I think, designed to encourage people to get vaccinated.
[01:41:13.227 --> 01:41:15.229]  Well, there's certainly been a lot of encouragement to get vaccinated.
[01:41:15.749 --> 01:41:21.571]  What's going on here is that we have a situation where we have people in positions of authority.
[01:41:21.571 --> 01:41:25.552]  The person you had on here in a position of authority was Sanjay Gupta.
[01:41:25.552 --> 01:41:32.634]  And I'm going to pick on him a little bit because Sanjay Gupta came on Sesame Street and I want to show the graphic if I don't have it.
[01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:38.236]  He came on Sesame Street and what he did is with another CNN correspondent.
[01:41:38.236 --> 01:41:41.337]  He was actually seducing children into taking the vaccine.
[01:41:41.337 --> 01:41:42.057]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:41:42.057 --> 01:41:42.718]  It's very disturbing.
[01:41:44.688 --> 01:41:49.611]  I am telling you, no good doctor would do that, because there must be risks and benefits.
[01:41:49.611 --> 01:41:53.834]  Did he tell the kids and the parents there's FDA warnings that this can cause heart inflammation?
[01:41:54.707 --> 01:41:59.189]  Did the other CNN correspondent, who's a mother, did she even show an ounce of concern?
[01:41:59.189 --> 01:42:03.051]  What Scott Atlas uses in his book, Joe, the term he uses is off the rails.
[01:42:03.051 --> 01:42:04.191]  We're off the rails.
[01:42:04.191 --> 01:42:06.892]  People in positions of authority are doing bad things.
[01:42:06.892 --> 01:42:13.795]  Trying to seduce children into taking a vaccine that has official FDA warnings on it, without giving fair balance, that's malfeasance.
[01:42:13.795 --> 01:42:15.476]  That's wrongdoing by people in positions of authority.
[01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:18.559]  Nobody can encourage somebody to take a vaccine, by the way.
[01:42:18.559 --> 01:42:20.461]  That violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:42:20.461 --> 01:42:21.402]  Can't do it.
[01:42:21.402 --> 01:42:22.864]  Research is neutral.
[01:42:22.864 --> 01:42:26.748]  As a doctor, I can never tell somebody they should take the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:42:26.748 --> 01:42:27.629]  Why?
[01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:30.673]  Because, same reason why I can't tell them, say, listen, you should be in my research study.
[01:42:30.673 --> 01:42:32.314]  You should take my research pill for diabetes.
[01:42:32.955 --> 01:42:35.357]  You know if I told them that, you should be in my research study?
[01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:38.059]  I'd be sanctioned by the IRB, I'd be called by the FDA.
[01:42:38.059 --> 01:42:39.240]  That's out of bounds.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.224]  We never give any pressure, coercion, or threat of reprisal for participating in research.
[01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:46.886]  It violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:42:46.886 --> 01:42:50.269]  And we certainly wouldn't do it with these vaccines because we don't have all the data yet.
[01:42:50.269 --> 01:42:52.911]  We have to reconcile with vaccine safety.
[01:42:52.911 --> 01:42:56.014]  So the story is, by January 22nd, we already had 182 deaths.
[01:43:01.175 --> 01:43:01.836]  Get our grape.
[01:43:01.836 --> 01:43:03.357]  Got a bag of it here.
[01:43:03.357 --> 01:43:06.840]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.941]  The communist!
[01:43:07.941 --> 01:43:15.287]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[01:43:15.287 --> 01:43:20.571]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[01:43:20.571 --> 01:43:25.255]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[01:43:25.255 --> 01:43:29.638]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[01:43:30.299 --> 01:43:36.525]  We sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:43:36.525 --> 01:43:40.688]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[01:43:40.688 --> 01:43:43.791]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[01:43:43.791 --> 01:43:47.034]  Um... Yeah, I'd like to.
[01:43:47.034 --> 01:43:48.055]  I'm sure you wouldn't believe it.
[01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:54.361]  Anyway, so, it's InfoWarsTore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us or don't want us here, that's fine.
[01:43:59.036 --> 01:44:09.139]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in World War II that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[01:44:09.139 --> 01:44:13.521]  And then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[01:44:13.521 --> 01:44:14.061]  And finally,
[01:44:14.941 --> 01:44:17.022]  And they can't apprehend those, nobody else to stand up.
[01:44:17.022 --> 01:44:21.883]  Well, the global social credit score that China's putting in, it's banning people to three hours of video games a week.
[01:44:21.883 --> 01:44:25.885]  And if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[01:44:25.885 --> 01:44:31.006]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports.
[01:44:31.006 --> 01:44:31.947]  They even admit it now.
[01:44:31.947 --> 01:44:34.587]  They're saying there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[01:44:34.587 --> 01:44:39.029]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[01:44:39.029 --> 01:44:40.349]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[01:44:40.349 --> 01:44:42.350]  They'll accept that, they'll accept anything.
[01:44:43.467 --> 01:44:49.388]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny, pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[01:44:49.388 --> 01:44:51.449]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[01:44:51.449 --> 01:44:58.910]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them, or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:12.013]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[01:45:12.796 --> 01:45:20.578]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, and fascist world government.
[01:45:20.578 --> 01:45:27.821]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:32.962]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[01:45:32.962 --> 01:45:37.204]  And because they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left
[01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.145]  Which is the ideology of this world government system.
[01:45:40.145 --> 01:45:41.646]  Couldn't win.
[01:45:41.646 --> 01:45:44.648]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[01:45:44.648 --> 01:45:46.689]  Now we know, two years ago.
[01:45:46.689 --> 01:45:48.990]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.590]  It's that simple.
[01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:52.672]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[01:45:52.672 --> 01:45:56.854]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[01:45:56.854 --> 01:45:58.295]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[01:45:58.895 --> 01:46:02.416]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[01:46:02.416 --> 01:46:17.138]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:46:17.138 --> 01:46:25.340]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.522]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:46:27.522 --> 01:46:35.329]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[01:46:35.329 --> 01:46:38.692]  government military grade at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:44.477]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:44.477 --> 01:46:45.878]  Again, we have big backpacks,
[01:46:46.178 --> 01:46:47.759]  We have special dry bags.
[01:46:47.759 --> 01:46:49.039]  We've got them for cell phones.
[01:46:49.039 --> 01:46:50.680]  We've got them for laptops.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.601]  We've got them for iPads.
[01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:54.202]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:54.202 --> 01:47:00.125]  So protect your privacy today and support the InfoWar at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:00.125 --> 01:47:06.028]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.301 --> 01:47:43.310]  Almost heaven West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains Shenandoah River Life is old there Older than the trees Younger than the mountains Growing like a breeze Country roads Take me home
[01:47:47.125 --> 01:47:51.153]  Take me home.
[01:48:00.788 --> 01:48:02.269]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:02.269 --> 01:48:04.231]  I want to finish up with Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:09.495]  That last clip we were on, a few others, and we're going to go right to your phone calls here throughout the entire third hour.
[01:48:09.495 --> 01:48:14.279]  Then, Owen Schroer is going to be taking over with some major breaking news information.
[01:48:14.279 --> 01:48:19.964]  But here's more of what they're trying to censor, what they're trying to block, the facts that they're killing us by design.
[01:48:19.964 --> 01:48:22.106]  This is a globalist corporate war.
[01:48:22.106 --> 01:48:23.026]  You're living in it.
[01:48:23.026 --> 01:48:24.027]  This is it.
[01:48:24.027 --> 01:48:25.188]  This is World War III.
[01:48:25.188 --> 01:48:25.569]  Here it is.
[01:48:26.169 --> 01:48:28.810]  We have to reconcile with vaccine safety.
[01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:33.392]  So the story is, by January 22nd, we already had 182 deaths after the vaccine.
[01:48:33.392 --> 01:48:34.773]  January 22nd.
[01:48:34.773 --> 01:48:40.916]  For all the vaccines combined, 278 million shots given each year in the United States.
[01:48:40.916 --> 01:48:42.176]  Kids, adults, me and you.
[01:48:42.176 --> 01:48:43.977]  I took two last year, I took one this year.
[01:48:43.977 --> 01:48:44.737]  270 million shots.
[01:48:44.737 --> 01:48:49.359]  The average number of deaths that would ever come into our central database, about 150.
[01:48:49.359 --> 01:48:51.180]  We've been keeping this database for 20 years.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:51.861]  Suddenly we're at 182.
[01:48:53.757 --> 01:48:53.957]  I think?
[01:49:13.596 --> 01:49:14.236]  I don't think so.
[01:49:36.787 --> 01:49:37.528]  Black Box Warning.
[01:49:37.528 --> 01:49:38.469]  May cause death.
[01:49:38.469 --> 01:49:39.470]  You get to 50 deaths.
[01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:42.072]  I don't care if 50 million, 60 million people take the drug.
[01:49:42.072 --> 01:49:43.173]  You get to 50 deaths.
[01:49:43.173 --> 01:49:43.914]  It's off the market.
[01:49:43.914 --> 01:49:45.175]  And it gets reviewed for safety.
[01:49:45.175 --> 01:49:47.397]  I've been involved with these, Joe, at a national level.
[01:49:47.397 --> 01:49:51.181]  We never let a drug go on and be associated with 50 deaths afterwards.
[01:49:51.181 --> 01:49:53.423]  We were at 182 and there was no safety review.
[01:49:53.423 --> 01:49:59.049]  Remember I told you in February, I demanded, as a citizen, I demanded a report from the federal government.
[01:49:59.209 --> 01:50:01.630]  We needed a report in a press briefing on vaccine-safe deficit.
[01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:02.270]  We never got it.
[01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:04.431]  From Finland, it was by Arola and colleagues.
[01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:07.812]  They came with the estimate of four cases per million per year as a baseline.
[01:50:07.812 --> 01:50:10.092]  So that means in the United States, 400, 800 cases a year.
[01:50:10.092 --> 01:50:14.333]  We've already gotten to over 13,000 cases in the United States.
[01:50:14.333 --> 01:50:17.434]  And we've seen cases of myocarditis, by the way, reported in the U.S.
[01:50:17.434 --> 01:50:21.496]  military, been reported from Israel, France, and elsewhere.
[01:50:21.496 --> 01:50:23.236]  The paper that showed it directly invades the heart.
[01:50:23.236 --> 01:50:26.077]  The spike protein, that was by Avolio and colleagues in their pericytes.
[01:50:26.757 --> 01:50:30.080]  And very importantly, the prognosis is what you're asking about.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:35.165]  The prognosis paper was published by Karsten Chopey, and that was in Circulation Research 2019.
[01:50:35.165 --> 01:50:42.552]  And what it showed is it showed that 13% of myocarditis, this is before COVID, ends up with progressive heart failure and worsening.
[01:50:42.552 --> 01:50:50.098]  My fear is some of these kids who develop myocarditis will be in a 13% category where they have progressive left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
[01:50:52.324 --> 01:50:59.970]  The myocarditis they're experiencing right now is damaged heart tissue, and that damaged heart tissue is not going to heal, and that it in fact might get worse.
[01:51:10.479 --> 01:51:11.739]  86% of the kids in the hospital.
[01:51:11.739 --> 01:51:13.620]  You know, there's myocarditis that we actually don't hospitalize.
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:17.661]  We can treat myocarditis and myopericarditis in the office, but these kids are sick enough to be hospitalized.
[01:51:17.661 --> 01:51:20.742]  I'm inferring that it's severe forms of it.
[01:51:20.742 --> 01:51:31.745]  This estimate from this paper would be 13% risk in these kids of developing heart failure or, you know, needing things like ICDs, heart failure, oral drugs, later on cardiac transplant or cardiac death.
[01:51:32.887 --> 01:51:37.868]  And now we've learned we can use hydrogen peroxide, dilute hydrogen peroxide with some Lugol's iodine.
[01:51:37.868 --> 01:51:45.530]  And believe it or not, the dentists in the American Dental Association guidelines use for cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, gingivitis, they use sodium hypochlorite.
[01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:46.970]  That's actually dilute bleach.
[01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:49.691]  Turns out it just takes a few drops of bleach in some household water.
[01:51:49.691 --> 01:51:50.411]  That's for the mouth.
[01:51:50.411 --> 01:51:52.371]  We typically don't use it in the nose, around the eyes.
[01:51:52.371 --> 01:51:56.012]  But remember when President Trump mentioned bleach and everybody had a big horse laugh on that?
[01:51:56.272 --> 01:51:57.874]  It turns out he just couldn't articulate.
[01:51:57.874 --> 01:52:02.999]  Someone was giving him the ADA recommendations for antiviral therapy for the mouth.
[01:52:02.999 --> 01:52:05.442]  The point is, pillar number one should have been contagion control.
[01:52:05.442 --> 01:52:07.123]  It should have been focused on the nose and the mouth.
[01:52:07.123 --> 01:52:08.685]  We learned it early.
[01:52:08.685 --> 01:52:11.708]  We learned it late, but if we could have used any of that early, it would have helped.
[01:52:11.708 --> 01:52:13.710]  Randomized trials of masks didn't work.
[01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:15.452]  Hand sanitizers and spraying football stadiums.
[01:52:15.452 --> 01:52:16.973]  There was even in Europe, they were spraying the sidewalk.
[01:52:16.973 --> 01:52:17.414]  That doesn't work.
[01:52:17.654 --> 01:52:20.858]  Do you think the masks have any effect on limiting the spread?
[01:52:20.858 --> 01:52:30.328]  You know, every time I go on Fox News, Laura Ingraham always tees up some comment on masks, and I just... masks are not my signature focus, right?
[01:52:30.328 --> 01:52:32.311]  And the reason being, if two people don't have the virus...
[01:52:32.551 --> 01:52:32.671]  Yeah.
[01:52:51.212 --> 01:52:51.352]  I think?
[01:53:23.453 --> 01:53:25.653]  They don't want this information on air.
[01:53:25.653 --> 01:53:26.594]  That's why we're here.
[01:53:26.594 --> 01:53:27.714]  That's why we're the tip of the spear.
[01:53:27.714 --> 01:53:33.316]  That's why we're not financed by George Soros and the globalists where just a billion bucks is given to us, we can all sit on our ass.
[01:53:33.316 --> 01:53:36.036]  We're financed by you, the listeners and viewers.
[01:53:36.036 --> 01:53:41.978]  And it's only when you decide to spread the word or share an article or share a video that it has an effect.
[01:53:41.978 --> 01:53:50.821]  That's why I just sit here all day saying, don't thank me, thank yourself when you share an article, when you share a video, when you tell people, hey, Alex has got this big guest on, tune in.
[01:53:52.478 --> 01:53:55.780]  It's the power of you taking action the establishment fears.
[01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:57.982]  All right, we're going to go to break in about four minutes.
[01:53:57.982 --> 01:54:08.230]  We're going to come back with William, Lori, Alex, Julie, Jason, Daniel, Kyle, Jordan, Truth Teller, Brad, John.
[01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:09.931]  We'll get to every one of those callers.
[01:54:09.931 --> 01:54:13.453]  We're not going to take any more after that, because they keep loading them on the board.
[01:54:13.453 --> 01:54:19.518]  We're going to take those 11 calls next hour, and then Owen Schroer takes over.
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.461]  There's a lot of other geopolitical news.
[01:54:22.461 --> 01:54:23.421]  There's a lot of inflation news.
[01:54:23.421 --> 01:54:24.462]  There's a lot of race betting news.
[01:54:24.462 --> 01:54:24.982]  I'm going to hit as well.
[01:54:24.982 --> 01:54:27.223]  I think I'm going to hit some more of that in a second.
[01:54:27.223 --> 01:54:34.186]  But seriously, anything I promote, anything I sell, is something I really believe in.
[01:54:34.186 --> 01:54:38.587]  So all the supplements are great, and the books, and the films, and the water filtration, the air filtration.
[01:54:38.587 --> 01:54:44.370]  It's all really high quality products at great prices that then also keep us on air so it's a 360 win.
[01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:47.231]  But Reset Wars is going
[01:54:49.898 --> 01:54:53.719]  To not be discounted tonight at midnight.
[01:54:53.719 --> 01:54:56.240]  Midnight Central or 1159 Central.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.421]  It goes to full price, which is fine.
[01:54:58.421 --> 01:54:58.801]  It's great.
[01:54:58.801 --> 01:55:00.541]  You're going to support us, and I appreciate it.
[01:55:00.541 --> 01:55:03.022]  But I would go get Reset Wars now.
[01:55:03.022 --> 01:55:04.283]  You know you're supporting the broadcast.
[01:55:04.283 --> 01:55:06.123]  You know you're in front of the tip of the spear.
[01:55:06.123 --> 01:55:08.664]  Plus, it's really something different we haven't covered yet.
[01:55:08.664 --> 01:55:10.965]  It gets to the mind, the soul, the body.
[01:55:10.965 --> 01:55:13.766]  We slowly go through it with all the documents and research.
[01:55:13.766 --> 01:55:16.766]  It's really a six, almost seven hour documentary.
[01:55:16.766 --> 01:55:17.607]  It's two courses.
[01:55:18.612 --> 01:55:28.797]  Mind Wars, Spirit Wars, and they just send you the video and you can open it and use it and watch anytime you want, share with your family, show to your church, whatever you're going to do.
[01:55:28.797 --> 01:55:31.638]  And yes, it funds our operation.
[01:55:31.638 --> 01:55:39.061]  So if you want 25% off on Reset Wars, the first big installment, it's available now at ResetWars.com.
[01:55:41.949 --> 01:55:50.195]  I gotta tell you, I mean if people actually know how real this is and actually research this and if you use this and then teach others, it's game over for the globalists.
[01:55:50.195 --> 01:55:55.379]  It's versus who they program and who they try to create versus who you are and who God made.
[01:55:55.379 --> 01:56:01.524]  And this is from a scientific quantum mechanics, quantum physics perspective.
[01:56:01.524 --> 01:56:06.728]  So I gotta tell you folks, just going there and getting the course will keep us on air and let us actually expand.
[01:56:07.386 --> 01:56:09.488]  So that's an important move, and I'm asking you to do it right now.
[01:56:09.488 --> 01:56:15.674]  If you care about what we're doing, I really appreciate you standing with us in the past, but now is the time as we enter the critical fight.
[01:56:15.674 --> 01:56:22.040]  Go to ResetWars.com, sign up, get the course, share it with your friends and family.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.662]  Just funding us is a win.
[01:56:24.895 --> 01:56:27.157]  The only lose is you not taking action and doing it.
[01:56:27.157 --> 01:56:28.118]  It's that simple.
[01:56:28.118 --> 01:56:30.439]  It's not like I'm up here saying all this hype and we haven't delivered.
[01:56:30.439 --> 01:56:32.201]  We're the Zeitgeist together.
[01:56:32.201 --> 01:56:33.722]  Us, this audience, and myself.
[01:56:33.722 --> 01:56:35.003]  You are InfoWars.
[01:56:35.003 --> 01:56:35.824]  You understand that?
[01:56:35.824 --> 01:56:36.884]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:56:36.884 --> 01:56:38.566]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:56:38.566 --> 01:56:40.107]  So become a member now.
[01:56:40.107 --> 01:56:41.788]  So much more is going to be rolled out from this.
[01:56:41.788 --> 01:56:46.492]  And we'll be able to bring the price way down once the infrastructure is built.
[01:56:46.492 --> 01:56:47.433]  But you're the founders.
[01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:51.496]  You're the people in on the bottom floor that bet it all and go in and do it.
[01:56:52.222 --> 01:56:59.247]  For the fraction of an NBA or NFL ticket, you can see this amazing course and support the broadcast.
[01:56:59.247 --> 01:57:03.991]  So I'm going to ask you again, are you going to support us or are you just going to act like you support Liberty?
[01:57:03.991 --> 01:57:05.933]  You're just tuned in to hear what Alex Jones is saying.
[01:57:05.933 --> 01:57:07.314]  This is something you need.
[01:57:07.314 --> 01:57:08.515]  It's something you need to share.
[01:57:08.515 --> 01:57:09.655]  You may already know all this stuff.
[01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:09.996]  Great.
[01:57:09.996 --> 01:57:12.858]  Get the course, support the broadcast, share it with your friends and family.
[01:57:14.113 --> 01:57:15.514]  ResetWars.com.
[01:57:15.514 --> 01:57:16.995]  ResetWars.com.
[01:57:16.995 --> 01:57:19.096]  Tonight at 1159 p.m.
[01:57:19.096 --> 01:57:20.977]  Central, you will no longer be 25% off.
[01:57:20.977 --> 01:57:25.600]  So take advantage of that right now at ResetWars.com.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:34.566]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back in hour number three with your phone calls in T-minus, what's two minutes?
[01:57:34.566 --> 01:57:35.647]  120 seconds.
[01:57:35.647 --> 01:57:39.750]  So we'll be right back as we lead up to the end of 2021 and the Year of the Tiger 2022.
[01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:40.070]  Stay with us.
[01:57:46.829 --> 01:57:51.856]  So this could be... This could be in full wars last Christmas.
[01:57:52.731 --> 01:57:55.472]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[01:57:55.472 --> 01:57:57.473]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[01:57:57.473 --> 01:58:02.135]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[01:58:02.135 --> 01:58:03.475]  They're coming after us.
[01:58:03.475 --> 01:58:11.899]  And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent media, in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms of 2022.
[01:58:11.899 --> 01:58:13.259]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[01:58:17.501 --> 01:58:18.882]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:58:18.882 --> 01:58:28.169]  I want to encourage you to do your Christmas shopping in fullrestore.com because I can barely keep our operation going and I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.
[01:58:28.169 --> 01:58:37.556]  I am so thankful for you and I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us and now redouble your efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on.
[01:58:37.936 --> 01:58:47.259]  InfoWarsStore.com has incredible products, store-wide free shipping up until December 20th, so please take action now and keep us on the air.
[01:58:47.259 --> 01:58:47.739]  Thank you.
[01:58:47.739 --> 01:58:54.962]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products, and that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:58:55.502 --> 01:58:59.044]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now.
[01:58:59.044 --> 01:59:05.128]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[01:59:05.128 --> 01:59:08.910]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:10.151]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[01:59:10.151 --> 01:59:14.934]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[01:59:15.334 --> 01:59:15.414]  It's
[01:59:31.971 --> 01:59:34.572]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:13.743 --> 02:00:14.883]  InfoWars.
[02:00:14.883 --> 02:00:16.064]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:00:16.064 --> 02:00:16.504]  Today.
[02:00:16.504 --> 02:00:21.965]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:21.965 --> 02:00:23.205]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.084 --> 02:00:44.948]  There are things the enemies of humanity don't want us to know.
[02:00:44.948 --> 02:00:47.910]  There are secrets they want to keep.
[02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:53.455]  I'm Alex Jones, and I've made it my life mission to expose those secrets and empower humanity.
[02:00:53.455 --> 02:00:55.918]  And I've made my greatest discovery yet.
[02:00:55.918 --> 02:00:59.481]  Join me there as humanity goes to the next level at ResetWars.com.
[02:01:11.056 --> 02:01:17.181]  It is said that the gods left steel on the field of battle and man discovered it.
[02:01:17.181 --> 02:01:23.426]  It is said by the Greeks that Prometheus was given the fire of God.
[02:01:23.426 --> 02:01:37.758]  Well, those fables, those stories are only archetypes of the truth that in our mind, in our psyche, in our soul, they have a connection to the higher dimensions, can reach forward into that, and already are born with Promethean fire.
[02:01:39.369 --> 02:01:43.212]  Or the God Consciousness that Dr. Zelenko was talking about last week with us.
[02:01:43.212 --> 02:01:45.054]  That's what we cover at ResetWars.com.
[02:01:45.054 --> 02:01:47.196]  You'd be a fool.
[02:01:47.196 --> 02:01:52.060]  A fool not to go, not to watch it, not to keep us on air, and to get this incredible information.
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:57.125]  Keeping us on air is such a small part of that, but it's also the key.
[02:01:57.125 --> 02:02:04.471]  So much of me doesn't want to be up here, constantly on air, constantly battling, constantly fighting, constantly begging.
[02:02:04.471 --> 02:02:05.692]  But that's the nature of liberty.
[02:02:05.692 --> 02:02:06.353]  It's struggling.
[02:02:08.052 --> 02:02:28.022]  The globalists just sit there and give trillions of themselves and everything's opulent and super yachts and everything's taken care of, there's never a question in the world, there's never a worry about payroll, and there's always just, they serve Satan, it's so easy, they can just float around this big hot tub of Satanism and not worry.
[02:02:28.022 --> 02:02:31.884]  But for me, and for you, we're constantly struggling.
[02:02:32.728 --> 02:02:34.970]  To pay the bills, to live our lives, to take care of our children.
[02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:36.751]  But that's okay.
[02:02:36.751 --> 02:02:43.596]  Because if you're put into a position on this planet where you're not having to worry about stuff, you are under Satan's control.
[02:02:43.596 --> 02:02:53.383]  Christ said, blessed are those that seek my name and support me and worship God with me, because you're going to be persecuted.
[02:02:53.383 --> 02:02:56.184]  Blessed are those that are persecuted.
[02:02:56.184 --> 02:02:57.345]  You're going to be persecuted.
[02:02:57.345 --> 02:02:59.587]  I mean, I'm butchering it, but you can pull up the quotes for yourself.
[02:03:01.263 --> 02:03:03.985]  I'm sure they'll got some Pharisee fake Christian line.
[02:03:03.985 --> 02:03:05.046]  He didn't quote it right.
[02:03:05.046 --> 02:03:06.727]  That's a satanic devil quote.
[02:03:06.727 --> 02:03:08.048]  I'm just going from memory here.
[02:03:08.048 --> 02:03:11.510]  Ain't no satanic devil quote.
[02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:12.591]  Oh, I am a wicked devil.
[02:03:12.591 --> 02:03:13.291]  I love Jesus.
[02:03:13.291 --> 02:03:14.452]  I want Jesus to save me.
[02:03:14.452 --> 02:03:17.454]  I'm not like you, how good you are and everything else.
[02:03:17.454 --> 02:03:19.356]  I'll rip your spinal cord out.
[02:03:19.356 --> 02:03:21.877]  I'll gouge your eyeballs out, you little glitter bug.
[02:03:21.877 --> 02:03:24.379]  I'm not up here like I'm some precious creature.
[02:03:24.379 --> 02:03:29.683]  I want to, I'm hanging on like the fall of Saigon.
[02:03:31.474 --> 02:03:37.157]  I'm hanging on to the helicopter skids like, get me out of here, get me out of here!
[02:03:37.157 --> 02:03:48.903]  I'm not up here like on some high and mighty, I'm this big Christian, and I'm so good, and I've thought all the rules, and I'm perfect, and like God's even proud of me, how upright I am.
[02:03:48.903 --> 02:03:51.104]  No, I'm hanging on.
[02:03:51.104 --> 02:03:55.406]  Guys, pull on the fall of Vietnam, 1975, hanging off helicopters.
[02:03:55.406 --> 02:03:56.707]  Hanoi.
[02:03:56.707 --> 02:03:57.967]  No, Hanoi's in the north.
[02:03:57.967 --> 02:03:58.768]  Befall of Saigon.
[02:03:58.768 --> 02:04:00.869]  I mean, show people when we come back.
[02:04:01.863 --> 02:04:04.525]  The fall of Saigon, U.S.
[02:04:04.525 --> 02:04:06.207]  troops hanging off helicopter skids.
[02:04:06.207 --> 02:04:11.271]  Because, see, I'm not up here badass, all gleaming, a victor, all this power.
[02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:12.832]  Oh, I'm this big smart guy.
[02:04:12.832 --> 02:04:14.293]  I'm New World Order.
[02:04:14.293 --> 02:04:15.234]  I'm Bill Gates.
[02:04:15.234 --> 02:04:16.155]  Oh, look at me.
[02:04:16.155 --> 02:04:18.237]  No, I'm hanging on the helicopter.
[02:04:18.237 --> 02:04:19.558]  Oh, please get me out of here!
[02:04:19.558 --> 02:04:20.158]  Please!
[02:04:20.158 --> 02:04:20.999]  Please help me!
[02:04:20.999 --> 02:04:21.500]  Please!
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:22.100]  Oh, God!
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.061]  I'm hanging on the helicopter.
[02:04:23.061 --> 02:04:23.862]  You understand?
[02:04:23.862 --> 02:04:25.803]  I'm hanging on to the helicopter skids.
[02:04:25.803 --> 02:04:27.885]  That's me.
[02:04:27.885 --> 02:04:29.006]  With crap running down my leg.
[02:04:30.856 --> 02:04:32.177]  Please, please, no!
[02:04:32.177 --> 02:04:32.557]  Help me!
[02:04:32.557 --> 02:04:35.079]  I'm asking the angels up in the helicopter.
[02:04:35.079 --> 02:04:35.960]  We reach down, we help them.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:36.781]  They're like, we're not sure.
[02:04:36.781 --> 02:04:38.863]  I'm like, please, please, I'm trying.
[02:04:38.863 --> 02:04:39.443]  I want to be good.
[02:04:39.443 --> 02:04:40.824]  Please help me, help me, help me.
[02:04:40.824 --> 02:04:42.505]  They're like, we're not sure yet.
[02:04:42.505 --> 02:04:45.288]  Maybe you've got to fall again.
[02:04:45.288 --> 02:04:46.028]  And I look down.
[02:04:46.028 --> 02:04:46.989]  I'm about to fall into.
[02:04:46.989 --> 02:04:48.690]  And I say, no, no, no.
[02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:50.272]  And they're like, you didn't do enough.
[02:04:50.272 --> 02:04:51.993]  And they kick your fingers off.
[02:04:51.993 --> 02:04:53.935]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:59.565]  Everything I do.
[02:04:59.565 --> 02:05:11.456]  So this could be literally your last chance, with all the insane things happening in the world, to get InfoWars products and to support us into 2022, the do or die year.

[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:36.281]  Turbo,
[02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:37.221]  We're good to go.
[02:06:04.284 --> 02:06:14.312]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.312 --> 02:06:19.096]  We now take you live to the ragtag defense of humanity.
[02:06:19.096 --> 02:06:23.900]  The cross-eyed dumbass goblin himself, Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:24.480]  Here we are.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:31.045]  Alright, I appreciate William and Lori and Alex and Julie and everybody that's patiently holding.
[02:06:31.045 --> 02:06:32.667]  Let me see who's been holding the longest here.
[02:06:35.825 --> 02:06:38.347]  Let's talk to Jordan in New Jersey first.
[02:06:38.347 --> 02:06:41.209]  Jordan in New Jersey, thanks for calling here on the air.
[02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:44.132]  God bless you.
[02:06:44.132 --> 02:06:46.234]  Peace be with you, brother Alex.
[02:06:46.234 --> 02:06:48.415]  Thank you, brother.
[02:06:48.415 --> 02:06:52.539]  So I just wanted to kind of do a little soliloquy here.
[02:06:52.539 --> 02:06:57.683]  My daughter, I put her in private school after I saw what was coming with the public schools.
[02:06:57.683 --> 02:06:59.564]  And so they started injecting these kids.
[02:06:59.564 --> 02:07:02.667]  The parents are willingly offering these children to Moloch.
[02:07:03.597 --> 02:07:08.019]  And the volcano, whatever you want to use as far as an ancient example.
[02:07:08.019 --> 02:07:10.360]  And the kids are getting sick, of course.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.501]  And the teachers are getting sick with these boosters.
[02:07:13.501 --> 02:07:17.323]  And it's getting really strange.
[02:07:17.323 --> 02:07:29.208]  On top of that, I just wanted to also report to everybody, including yourself, I've seen extraordinarily increased activity I've never seen before of black hawk helicopters over my house.
[02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:32.349]  I live in suburban New Jersey, not near any military installations.
[02:07:33.467 --> 02:07:35.468]  Gunships.
[02:07:35.468 --> 02:07:41.150]  My neighbors have seen them, which I just wanted to also report to you.
[02:07:41.150 --> 02:08:00.877]  Now, in addition to that, I want to talk about all the new revelations, shall we call them, of the DNA repair issue that you've been identifying and these other studies have been identifying, which almost is exactly what happens when the body is bombarded by high
[02:08:02.299 --> 02:08:03.360]  Refresh my memory.
[02:08:27.774 --> 02:08:35.118]  It's called JADC2, which is, you know, the acronym for Joint All Domain Command and Control, all right?
[02:08:35.118 --> 02:08:42.703]  Which is the DoD's sweeping effort to digitally interconnect its weapon systems and sensors across all military branches.
[02:08:42.703 --> 02:08:46.365]  Sure, that's all Cyber Command censorship, Greg.
[02:08:46.365 --> 02:08:48.746]  Exactly, which relies upon what?
[02:08:48.746 --> 02:08:50.447]  5G, right?
[02:08:50.447 --> 02:08:51.928]  So, during the lockdowns,
[02:08:52.833 --> 02:08:58.897]  They were placing, and I'm a local attorney and I've had people call me, they're placing 5G towers all over the place.
[02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:01.059]  And you've reported on this as well.
[02:09:01.059 --> 02:09:06.122]  And you had Dr. Meridon yesterday talking about this connection with 5G and so forth.
[02:09:06.122 --> 02:09:20.232]  So I find it very odd that the exact effect that the vaccine causes as far as the DNA damage is almost the exact effect that high frequency doses of this 5G radiation and cosmic radiation causes.
[02:09:20.232 --> 02:09:20.412]  You know?
[02:09:21.774 --> 02:09:31.360]  And again, the cosmic radiation comes in in floods, but on time, and it's continual until it ebbs.
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:37.584]  The 5G is turning on and off constantly, which our cells have never experienced in their own studies, and that's how they're controlling us.
[02:09:37.584 --> 02:09:38.625]  Thank you, Jordan.
[02:09:38.625 --> 02:09:39.565]  Really, really great points.
[02:09:39.565 --> 02:09:41.226]  Let's get to all these callers.
[02:09:41.226 --> 02:09:41.987]  They're all amazing.
[02:09:43.235 --> 02:09:47.636]  Let's go ahead and take another call from Jason in Texas.
[02:09:47.636 --> 02:09:50.976]  He's bringing up 5G as well, and Greg Reese's report here today.
[02:09:50.976 --> 02:09:51.697]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:09:51.697 --> 02:09:55.037]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:09:55.037 --> 02:10:11.660]  About two months ago, I was just feeling really weak and just kind of sick, and finally I went into the doctor about two weeks ago, and I had low hemoglobin, and now I guess my red blood, you know.
[02:10:12.102 --> 02:10:13.203]  Think nothing of it.
[02:10:13.203 --> 02:10:23.768]  Then I saw Greg Reese's report, and then you had the lady on last night, you know, yesterday about talking about this stuff.
[02:10:23.768 --> 02:10:24.909]  100% believe it.
[02:10:24.909 --> 02:10:34.053]  Of course, now I got a 5G phone because that's all they have now, you know, so it's... Yeah, but just because your phone says it works with 5G doesn't mean it's 5G.
[02:10:34.053 --> 02:10:37.075]  It just means it's 5G enabled.
[02:10:37.075 --> 02:10:41.117]  So, but no, I truly believe that's what it's from.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:45.283]  You know, now I'm on these iron pills and all that.
[02:10:45.283 --> 02:10:57.892]  Oh, there's so many documented studies, and you mentioned the Gregory's Report that has some of them, that it pushes oxygen out of the blood, and that it's a really powerful transmitter when you're up close to it, like a microwave.
[02:10:57.892 --> 02:11:01.515]  Not like a microwave, it is a microwave, and that it's out of control.
[02:11:01.515 --> 02:11:03.256]  I mean, they are killing us, folks.
[02:11:03.256 --> 02:11:05.418]  This is a takeover.
[02:11:05.418 --> 02:11:05.938]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:11:05.938 --> 02:11:08.100]  Yeah.
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:10.041]  Go ahead, Jason, you want to add something else?
[02:11:10.041 --> 02:11:10.982]  Oh, I was just going to say,
[02:11:11.875 --> 02:11:24.861]  The pedophile puppet down in Kentucky touring the tornado disaster and he happened to bring along a COVID vaccine team to get people vaccinated if they want our boosters.
[02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:26.822]  I just think that's disgusting.
[02:11:26.822 --> 02:11:32.285]  Well, you know, the only thing that's similar between the un-vaxxed and the vaxxed is you're never fully vaxxed.
[02:11:32.285 --> 02:11:35.827]  And the worst part about the first 15 days flat on the curb is the first two years.
[02:11:35.827 --> 02:11:36.327]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:41.061]  All right, let's go to Lori in Idaho.
[02:11:41.061 --> 02:11:42.582]  Lori, you're on the air.
[02:11:42.582 --> 02:11:43.402]  Thank you for calling.
[02:11:43.402 --> 02:11:45.363]  Go ahead.
[02:11:45.363 --> 02:11:47.644]  Alex, good to finally talk to you.
[02:11:47.644 --> 02:11:49.244]  I've been a longtime listener since 2011.
[02:11:49.244 --> 02:11:52.025]  Lori, thank you for calling.
[02:11:52.025 --> 02:11:52.486]  We love you.
[02:11:52.486 --> 02:11:55.407]  Go ahead.
[02:11:55.407 --> 02:12:00.689]  In 2011, I kind of seen a lot of corruption going on in the accounting office I worked in.
[02:12:01.385 --> 02:12:02.466]  Well, it was all true.
[02:12:02.466 --> 02:12:04.968]  I got terminated.
[02:12:04.968 --> 02:12:06.770]  My tribe disconnected me from them.
[02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:09.573]  I live on an Indian reservation out in Idaho.
[02:12:09.573 --> 02:12:17.700]  Anyway, last week I took my daughter-in-law into the hospital to go have her baby.
[02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.642]  She wasn't until the 10th.
[02:12:19.642 --> 02:12:22.705]  They pulled that baby out of her on Wednesday.
[02:12:22.705 --> 02:12:25.047]  And on Friday, the 10th, CPS
[02:12:27.483 --> 02:12:37.219]  And a detective came in and gave her one sheet of paper and said we're taking your baby because your test came back with drugs in it.
[02:12:37.219 --> 02:12:37.619]  Wow.
[02:12:37.619 --> 02:12:41.586]  So we're fighting tooth and nail to try to get that baby back.
[02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:47.875]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that's happening, but yeah, the system's totally predatory, and half the time those tests are fake.
[02:12:47.875 --> 02:12:55.662]  But again, the government ships the fentanyl in, they ban the ivermectin, and then if somebody smokes marijuana, they take their children from them.
[02:12:55.662 --> 02:12:58.604]  Just say you're an illegal alien, and then they'll let you go.
[02:12:58.604 --> 02:13:00.806]  Say you're a communist.
[02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:01.667]  Right.
[02:13:01.667 --> 02:13:07.732]  And so I had her do the vaccine waiver out of Idaho, where they can't vaccinate the babies.
[02:13:08.539 --> 02:13:11.741]  And that CPS worker said, who told you to do this?
[02:13:11.741 --> 02:13:13.142]  Who's telling you to do this?
[02:13:13.142 --> 02:13:15.563]  She said, I'm doing it on my own.
[02:13:15.563 --> 02:13:19.085]  I said, you tell them that you're not going to be on welfare.
[02:13:19.085 --> 02:13:21.566]  You're going to pay for the baby's hospital bills.
[02:13:21.566 --> 02:13:24.448]  We have a family pediatrician.
[02:13:24.448 --> 02:13:30.411]  And this young lady is adopted daughter out of Salt Lake.
[02:13:30.411 --> 02:13:31.672]  She was only eight years old.
[02:13:31.672 --> 02:13:32.873]  Well, Lori, God bless you.
[02:13:32.873 --> 02:13:34.794]  You know, the state's waging war on our children.
[02:13:35.385 --> 02:13:39.829]  It's not our government, it's not our state, and there's good people in it, but the overall system's bad.
[02:13:39.829 --> 02:13:40.949]  God bless you and thank you for the call.
[02:13:40.949 --> 02:13:42.671]  We're going to all these calls.
[02:13:42.671 --> 02:13:44.592]  Halox in Seattle.
[02:13:44.592 --> 02:13:45.733]  Halox, you're on the air.
[02:13:45.733 --> 02:13:48.735]  Go ahead.
[02:13:48.735 --> 02:13:52.478]  Yes, it's actually Halox.
[02:13:52.478 --> 02:13:52.959]  Go ahead.
[02:13:52.959 --> 02:13:53.999]  Halox, X-A-V-O-X.
[02:13:53.999 --> 02:13:57.722]  Yeah, I want to do a couple of plugs.
[02:13:57.722 --> 02:14:01.265]  X2, I've been thinking for a few years now.
[02:14:01.265 --> 02:14:04.047]  When you see a lot of people that are 20-year-olds,
[02:14:05.495 --> 02:14:06.436]  Thanks for the support, brother.
[02:14:06.436 --> 02:14:07.617]  What's on your mind?
[02:14:31.833 --> 02:14:37.238]  Well, we are actually working with the Spanish counterpart of InfoWars, InfoGuerra.
[02:14:37.238 --> 02:14:42.162]  It's a YouTube channel with 162,000 subscribers.
[02:14:42.162 --> 02:14:43.043]  I've been seeing that.
[02:14:43.043 --> 02:14:44.825]  Yeah, great job, brother.
[02:14:44.825 --> 02:14:46.306]  God bless you.
[02:14:46.306 --> 02:14:49.609]  We are uploading some of the reports, some of the news.
[02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:51.150]  We are waking people up.
[02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:52.271]  It's the time to take action.
[02:14:52.271 --> 02:14:57.416]  So, follow them in InfoGuerra, Spanish, and also my Telegram, Havox.
[02:14:58.922 --> 02:15:01.184]  Infoguerras USA.
[02:15:01.184 --> 02:15:07.107]  Infoguerras on Bandot Video, on YouTube, and on Telegram.
[02:15:07.107 --> 02:15:08.188]  That's right, sir.
[02:15:08.188 --> 02:15:10.529]  And yeah, you'll find us there, Infoguerra.
[02:15:10.529 --> 02:15:12.490]  We're waking the Spanish people up.
[02:15:12.490 --> 02:15:12.770]  Thank you.
[02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:13.611]  I know you are.
[02:15:13.611 --> 02:15:14.231]  I saw you.
[02:15:14.231 --> 02:15:16.533]  Some of your videos are getting hundreds of thousands of views, brother.
[02:15:16.533 --> 02:15:16.993]  Good job.
[02:15:18.675 --> 02:15:21.277]  Yeah, so we are promoting the action.
[02:15:21.277 --> 02:15:23.218]  Take the action into your own hands.
[02:15:23.218 --> 02:15:26.421]  The more we weigh people up, the more people are going to act.
[02:15:26.421 --> 02:15:27.582]  That's right.
[02:15:27.582 --> 02:15:29.463]  Well, I love your spirit.
[02:15:29.463 --> 02:15:30.124]  And how do I say it?
[02:15:30.124 --> 02:15:31.925]  I say it Halox.
[02:15:31.925 --> 02:15:33.386]  It's actually Halox.
[02:15:33.386 --> 02:15:34.927]  It's like Havoc.
[02:15:34.927 --> 02:15:36.769]  X-A-V-O-X.
[02:15:36.769 --> 02:15:37.269]  Oh, I got it.
[02:15:37.269 --> 02:15:37.849]  It's Halox.
[02:15:37.849 --> 02:15:39.150]  Okay, I got it.
[02:15:39.150 --> 02:15:40.231]  It's just an H on screen.
[02:15:40.231 --> 02:15:41.772]  Thank you and God bless you.
[02:15:41.772 --> 02:15:44.494]  Wow, amazing talking to folks like that.
[02:15:44.494 --> 02:15:45.215]  Just incredible.
[02:15:46.511 --> 02:15:47.492]  I mean, we're it, folks.
[02:15:47.492 --> 02:15:48.253]  We're the resistance.
[02:15:48.253 --> 02:15:48.833]  It's not hype.
[02:15:48.833 --> 02:15:50.735]  It's not like we're all, oh, we're the resistance.
[02:15:50.735 --> 02:15:52.136]  No, we are it.
[02:15:52.136 --> 02:15:55.599]  They're injecting children with HIV-creating systems.
[02:16:00.562 --> 02:16:02.083]  I've got a bag of it here.
[02:16:02.083 --> 02:16:05.967]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[02:16:05.967 --> 02:16:07.047]  The communists!
[02:16:07.047 --> 02:16:14.393]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[02:16:14.393 --> 02:16:19.698]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[02:16:19.698 --> 02:16:24.421]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[02:16:24.421 --> 02:16:28.745]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[02:16:28.985 --> 02:16:35.630]  Same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:39.812]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[02:16:39.812 --> 02:16:42.894]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:47.237]  Um... We had like the... You wouldn't believe it.
[02:16:47.237 --> 02:16:53.582]  Anyway, so, it's InfoWarsStore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us or don't want us here, that's fine.
[02:17:01.374 --> 02:17:02.595]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:17:02.595 --> 02:17:03.436]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:17:03.436 --> 02:17:04.736]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:17:04.736 --> 02:17:05.297]  Good, Bob.
[02:17:05.297 --> 02:17:06.398]  Great last caller.
[02:17:06.398 --> 02:17:09.460]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:15.164]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:17:15.164 --> 02:17:16.925]  It's like we're living out of Twilight Zone, man.
[02:17:17.285 --> 02:17:18.947]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:17:18.947 --> 02:17:19.888]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:17:19.888 --> 02:17:20.249]  Go ahead.
[02:17:20.249 --> 02:17:21.790]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:24.814]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:17:24.814 --> 02:17:26.496]  The X-Tune does wonders.
[02:17:26.496 --> 02:17:27.617]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:17:27.617 --> 02:17:28.819]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:17:28.819 --> 02:17:29.619]  Get off the fence.
[02:17:29.619 --> 02:17:30.300]  Get the product.
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:31.702]  Support the info war.
[02:17:31.702 --> 02:17:33.003]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:17:33.003 --> 02:17:33.664]  You're on the air.
[02:17:33.664 --> 02:17:34.185]  Thanks for calling.
[02:17:34.185 --> 02:17:34.565]  Go ahead.
[02:17:34.565 --> 02:17:36.287]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:17:36.287 --> 02:17:36.848]  It's an honor.
[02:17:37.008 --> 02:17:37.708]  Honor, talk to you.
[02:17:37.708 --> 02:17:38.989]  Awesome.
[02:17:38.989 --> 02:17:42.591]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[02:17:42.591 --> 02:17:47.153]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half, she loves it.
[02:17:47.153 --> 02:17:48.513]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[02:17:48.513 --> 02:17:50.074]  So, just number one for viewers.
[02:17:50.074 --> 02:17:51.155]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:17:51.155 --> 02:17:52.795]  It's not a joke.
[02:17:52.795 --> 02:17:59.779]  Absolutely.
[02:17:59.779 --> 02:18:03.180]  What are champions made of?
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:04.321]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:18:10.894 --> 02:18:12.795]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:18:12.795 --> 02:18:14.355]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[02:20:41.042 --> 02:20:43.583]  I'm just blown away to be here.
[02:20:43.583 --> 02:20:45.503]  Such a crazy world.
[02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:50.225]  I've got so many news clips and things I haven't covered yet, but we're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:20:50.225 --> 02:20:52.746]  So let's go right back to your calls.
[02:20:52.746 --> 02:20:53.606]  We got Julie.
[02:20:53.606 --> 02:20:54.366]  We got Daniel.
[02:20:54.366 --> 02:20:55.067]  We got Kyle.
[02:20:55.067 --> 02:20:55.787]  We got Truth.
[02:20:57.125 --> 02:20:57.845]  Teller.
[02:20:57.845 --> 02:20:58.566]  We got Brad.
[02:20:58.566 --> 02:20:59.867]  We got John.
[02:20:59.867 --> 02:21:04.689]  And speaking of Truth Teller, let's go to Truth Teller right now from FEMA Region 5.
[02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:08.852]  Truth Teller, welcome.
[02:21:08.852 --> 02:21:10.853]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:21:10.853 --> 02:21:11.854]  Good to have you here, brother.
[02:21:11.854 --> 02:21:12.634]  Go ahead.
[02:21:12.634 --> 02:21:13.194]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:13.194 --> 02:21:17.597]  It's Texas Truth Teller, but that's side issue.
[02:21:17.597 --> 02:21:19.438]  But first of all, I want to give a quick plug.
[02:21:19.438 --> 02:21:22.920]  I'm a competitive runner and the combination of
[02:21:24.026 --> 02:21:34.831]  Super male vitality, ultra 12, and turbo force definitely gives me what I need to run competitively at age 62.
[02:21:34.831 --> 02:21:42.835]  Many times I've been able to place first, second, or third in my age division, and then post-race, the ultimate bone broth.
[02:21:42.835 --> 02:21:46.017]  I was so glad when you got that back in stock.
[02:21:47.382 --> 02:21:48.663]  So, great products.
[02:21:48.663 --> 02:21:49.663]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:21:49.663 --> 02:21:55.305]  Tell us about how you run competitively, because, I mean, we go out to the top labs and say, we want the best you've got.
[02:21:55.305 --> 02:21:58.186]  They usually go, well, we could make it even better, but you've got to pay more.
[02:21:58.186 --> 02:22:08.850]  So, a lot of our products, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, our B12, all of them are basically the highest level, or levels no one's ever done before, because I'm not going to sell something that's BS.
[02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:11.251]  So, tell us about your experience.
[02:22:11.251 --> 02:22:14.692]  Well, like, for instance, with the TurboForce, okay?
[02:22:15.342 --> 02:22:23.731]  When I take that, Alex, I had a Thanksgiving Day run just recently, and I placed second for men 60-64.
[02:22:23.731 --> 02:22:25.573]  I ran the race in just over 24 minutes.
[02:22:29.042 --> 02:22:42.173]  At age 62, I thank God for that, but your products have definitely been instrumental in my success as a runner, and everybody needs to support what you do there with InfoWare Store, so I want to give that plug now.
[02:22:42.173 --> 02:22:43.494]  Hey, great story, brother.
[02:22:43.494 --> 02:22:44.094]  Love to hear it.
[02:22:44.094 --> 02:22:46.256]  So, Texas Truth Teller, tell us what else is going on.
[02:22:47.333 --> 02:22:57.500]  Okay, so the reason I called, you know, this morning Harrison Smith made a comment, which I agree and I want to kind of expand on this a little bit without taking too much time.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:08.027]  He said that this whole COVID situation, which as we know is a scam-demic and a plannedemic, it was an IQ test for America.
[02:23:08.027 --> 02:23:11.149]  And Alex, I've been watching people for years.
[02:23:11.149 --> 02:23:14.351]  I knew when they came out with these devices that they call phones,
[02:23:15.106 --> 02:23:16.507]  That this is going to be trouble.
[02:23:16.507 --> 02:23:19.548]  They set people up for what they've now implemented.
[02:23:19.548 --> 02:23:27.191]  And here's the thing, even with everything the globalists are doing, how evil they are, I don't see them as the biggest enemy.
[02:23:27.191 --> 02:23:33.593]  I remember years ago when Tex Meyers interviewed in his documentary called Night Stalkers Over America.
[02:23:33.593 --> 02:23:39.035]  And you made a statement to him when he asked you, how do you deal with people that don't want to hear the truth?
[02:23:39.035 --> 02:23:43.597]  He said, well, you said, if you look, if they look at you like with the deer in the headlights there,
[02:23:44.249 --> 02:23:46.950]  Just move on to somebody who listened and maybe prayed.
[02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:50.332]  Wow, you're an original... I'm sorry to interrupt.
[02:23:50.332 --> 02:23:51.692]  Repeat what I said in the text, Mark.
[02:23:51.692 --> 02:23:52.512]  You're right.
[02:23:52.512 --> 02:23:54.573]  You're an original gangster.
[02:23:54.573 --> 02:23:57.475]  That was over 20 plus years ago, that documentary.
[02:23:57.475 --> 02:23:58.135]  Wow.
[02:23:58.135 --> 02:23:59.575]  So you've been watching and listening a long time.
[02:23:59.575 --> 02:24:01.716]  I mean, repeat what Tex said, God bless him.
[02:24:01.716 --> 02:24:02.957]  Went on to see the Lord a few years ago.
[02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:12.783]  In 1999, that's when I was made aware of you, and he asked you, how do you deal with people who don't want to hear what you know is true?
[02:24:12.783 --> 02:24:24.548]  And you said, well, other than pray for them, there's really nothing you can do when they're looking at you with this deer-in-the-headlights stare reaction, and just move on to somebody who wants to hear it because you're wasting your time.
[02:24:24.548 --> 02:24:25.809]  And this is what I wanted to get at.
[02:24:25.809 --> 02:24:26.609]  Mike Adams
[02:24:27.065 --> 02:24:43.194]  Just recently, on naturalnews.com, he posted something from Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a Lutheran pastor who was part of the resistance to actually... Sure, he said, first they came for this group, I wasn't them, I didn't do anything, and finally they came for me and there was nobody left, yeah.
[02:24:43.194 --> 02:24:48.597]  Yeah, no, that's a different pastor, but what he put forth was... It's right in my memory, what did Bonhoeffer say?
[02:24:49.699 --> 02:24:52.020]  He called it the Theory of Stupidity.
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:25:00.166]  He said you would be better off trying to deal with somebody and reason with them who was malicious in their attitude than people who are stupid.
[02:25:00.166 --> 02:25:00.866]  No, I agree.
[02:25:00.866 --> 02:25:03.247]  Like, evil people shouldn't want the Great Reset.
[02:25:03.247 --> 02:25:06.089]  It's gonna make them... It kills almost everybody.
[02:25:06.089 --> 02:25:09.171]  Like, no one should be for this.
[02:25:09.171 --> 02:25:11.973]  And I'll give you a couple quick examples, Alex.
[02:25:11.973 --> 02:25:14.374]  Okay, I'm talking to a woman on the buses.
[02:25:14.374 --> 02:25:17.036]  I use the public transportation here in Florida.
[02:25:17.759 --> 02:25:22.514]  And the thing is, she says to me, this is a passenger, Sir, you need to wear your mask!
[02:25:23.348 --> 02:25:27.909]  And I looked at her, so I finally got it out, I stuck it on my chin, and I go, there, do you feel happy now?
[02:25:27.909 --> 02:25:29.170]  I said, you know what this is?
[02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:30.950]  This is a Covidiet pacifier.
[02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:39.813]  She's looking at me with this dumb look, and I said to her, and then I said, you know, Jesus doesn't want me to wear that because it's bad for my health.
[02:25:39.813 --> 02:25:45.694]  And she says, well, but you know, if you're a Christian, we're supposed to honor the government, but we're on a bus.
[02:25:45.694 --> 02:25:47.835]  We're not even in a government facility.
[02:25:47.835 --> 02:25:48.355]  I hear you.
[02:25:48.355 --> 02:25:50.136]  I appreciate your call, Texas Retailer.
[02:25:50.136 --> 02:25:51.216]  Look, in Florida,
[02:25:52.219 --> 02:25:54.741]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:25:54.741 --> 02:26:01.105]  Christ was being confronted by the Pharisees saying you shouldn't pay your taxes, knowing he'd be executed if he said you shouldn't.
[02:26:01.105 --> 02:26:03.827]  So he said, that's Caesar's face on the coin.
[02:26:03.827 --> 02:26:05.549]  Give him what is his.
[02:26:05.549 --> 02:26:06.249]  I mean, no kidding.
[02:26:06.249 --> 02:26:07.090]  It's like his coin.
[02:26:07.090 --> 02:26:08.110]  It's his system.
[02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:09.431]  He issued it.
[02:26:09.431 --> 02:26:12.053]  Render unto Caesar those things that are Caesar's.
[02:26:12.053 --> 02:26:13.154]  To God, things that are God's.
[02:26:13.154 --> 02:26:15.656]  That makes total sense.
[02:26:15.656 --> 02:26:16.817]  You're in somebody's house.
[02:26:16.817 --> 02:26:17.898]  You're doing somebody's system.
[02:26:17.898 --> 02:26:19.118]  That's theirs.
[02:26:19.118 --> 02:26:21.220]  But give to God the things that are God's.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:29.384]  So the idiots that try to use Roman 13 like Hitler did to control people are just either control freaks or liars.
[02:26:29.384 --> 02:26:29.704]  All right.
[02:26:29.704 --> 02:26:32.065]  Thank you, Truth Teller.
[02:26:32.065 --> 02:26:35.207]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julie in the tri-state area.
[02:26:35.207 --> 02:26:36.068]  Julie, you're on the air.
[02:26:36.068 --> 02:26:38.549]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:38.549 --> 02:26:39.549]  Alex, hi.
[02:26:39.549 --> 02:26:41.370]  Welcome.
[02:26:41.370 --> 02:26:45.233]  I've been kind of focusing on social media while I've been on hold with you.
[02:26:45.233 --> 02:26:49.675]  And did you know today is the year anniversary since they started giving these things to people?
[02:26:50.686 --> 02:26:51.127]  Yes.
[02:26:51.127 --> 02:26:53.809]  It's trending today, get boosted.
[02:26:53.809 --> 02:26:58.372]  And Fauci has stated that he's not going to focus on Omicron Vax.
[02:26:58.372 --> 02:27:04.376]  They're full court pressing these boosts and people are lining up from everywhere.
[02:27:04.376 --> 02:27:10.080]  And, you know, I'm out east, but I just, you know, kind of take a survey of everywhere around the country.
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:15.904]  And it's beyond distressing how brainwashed these people are.
[02:27:15.904 --> 02:27:19.146]  And I really think that what Dr. Merritt was talking about yesterday
[02:27:19.673 --> 02:27:37.046]  That even more serious than this, you know, spike protein virus is the level and the degree of how people on every socioeconomic background, education background, age, wherever they are, they are so brainwashed, Alex.
[02:27:37.046 --> 02:27:39.588]  I mean, it's beyond the pale.
[02:27:39.588 --> 02:27:40.508]  You're totally right.
[02:27:40.508 --> 02:27:41.349]  You're totally right.
[02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:45.212]  It's like a sick IQ test, like the last caller said.
[02:27:46.027 --> 02:27:50.030]  And the fallout, something is happening like this week.
[02:27:50.030 --> 02:28:01.619]  I was just reading right now, they're saying Cornell University has gone ahead and decided to go remote because they've had over 900 COVID cases this week.
[02:28:01.619 --> 02:28:07.904]  The VP for the university said... Despite the fact I've got the article, they're 96% vaccinated, but they've got to close down.
[02:28:07.904 --> 02:28:15.750]  It's all a fraud, it's meant to collapse society, and everyone's buying into it like it's for their safety, when no, it's a post-industrial Great Reset Plan.
[02:28:16.747 --> 02:28:30.784]  I think that people though that are working remotely, away from their offices, I think there are a significant amount of people that are much sicker than they're letting on because they're staying inside and suffering in silence.
[02:28:30.784 --> 02:28:33.727]  And I know that verbatim because somebody in my family works remote.
[02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:39.410]  They have to kind of cajole the people to talk to them.
[02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:44.152]  And once they start talking, they start disclosing these issues that they're having.
[02:28:44.152 --> 02:28:47.133]  I have family who just died in nursing homes.
[02:28:47.133 --> 02:28:48.353]  No one will come see them.
[02:28:48.353 --> 02:28:49.094]  You're absolutely right.
[02:28:49.094 --> 02:28:51.575]  This is a psychological warfare takeover.
[02:28:51.575 --> 02:28:53.675]  It's fifth generation warfare.
[02:28:53.675 --> 02:28:54.916]  Thank you so much for the call, Julie.
[02:28:56.297 --> 02:29:04.923]  If you're concerned about the power grid and... We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free from it.
[02:29:04.923 --> 02:29:07.625]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[02:29:07.625 --> 02:29:23.016]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the Great Reset and want a one-world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[02:29:23.016 --> 02:29:24.978]  After decades of intense research,
[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:31.943]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[02:29:31.943 --> 02:29:34.884]  The Reset Wars have begun.

[02:29:38.746 --> 02:29:44.788]  They're programming our very subconscious and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control.

[02:30:01.233 --> 02:30:15.202]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[02:30:15.202 --> 02:30:19.645]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.

[02:31:05.882 --> 02:31:10.206]  After years of being off the shelves, we're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever.
[02:31:10.206 --> 02:31:13.008]  And it's now been reformulated and is even stronger.
[02:31:13.008 --> 02:31:14.890]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:24.573]  It's got concentrated high-quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[02:31:24.573 --> 02:31:28.194]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[02:31:28.194 --> 02:31:34.735]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[02:31:34.735 --> 02:31:39.197]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[02:31:39.197 --> 02:31:44.058]  Again, it has that cutting-edge chicken broth protein isolate powder.
[02:31:44.318 --> 02:31:44.618]  We're good.
[02:32:00.990 --> 02:32:02.010]  We're good to go.
[02:32:25.566 --> 02:32:31.370]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:32:31.370 --> 02:32:43.599]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[02:32:44.139 --> 02:32:48.122]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[02:32:48.122 --> 02:32:53.746]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[02:32:53.746 --> 02:32:59.510]  And we are opposing the One World Government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[02:32:59.510 --> 02:33:05.414]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.518 --> 02:33:22.000]  So we're showing 1975, the fall of Saigon that I mentioned earlier.
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.521]  Helicopters coming and picking up people trying to evacuate, including U.S.
[02:33:26.521 --> 02:33:29.202]  personnel.
[02:33:29.202 --> 02:33:33.584]  And it's similar to what we just saw a few months ago in Afghanistan.
[02:33:33.584 --> 02:33:35.825]  Biden said you won't see images of helicopters on roofs.
[02:33:35.825 --> 02:33:36.745]  We saw exactly that.
[02:33:38.390 --> 02:33:45.072]  But the reason I raise that is, I'm not some big powerful badass up here that's got all the answers.
[02:33:45.072 --> 02:33:46.993]  I'm defeating the new world order with you.
[02:33:46.993 --> 02:33:49.393]  No, no, it's all God in charge.
[02:33:49.393 --> 02:33:58.256]  And I'm hanging on the helicopter skids, trying to get past my sins just like you are.
[02:33:58.256 --> 02:34:01.337]  I'm a pathetic person.
[02:34:01.337 --> 02:34:03.358]  But I love God.
[02:34:03.358 --> 02:34:05.378]  And I've got that connection.
[02:34:05.378 --> 02:34:06.859]  And I'm hanging on to those skids.
[02:34:08.078 --> 02:34:14.500]  All the arrogant Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates's and the things they do to the children, everything they think they're getting away with, they're not getting away with any of it.
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:15.101]  They're going to fail.
[02:34:15.101 --> 02:34:17.822]  They're going to fall.
[02:34:17.822 --> 02:34:23.844]  But we break down the secrets of transcending their lies and how they're psychologically keeping us in presence.
[02:34:23.844 --> 02:34:33.688]  In the new course that we just released a few days ago, today's the last day to get 25% off at midnight tonight, Central Time, 1159, ResetWars.com.

[02:34:38.848 --> 02:34:41.629]  I'm not going to say you have a responsibility, because you've got a free will here.
[02:34:41.629 --> 02:34:47.491]  But if you don't go get this course, if you don't watch it, if you don't share it, if you don't show your friends and family, what's the whole point?
[02:34:47.491 --> 02:34:48.971]  Because everything we do is real.
[02:34:48.971 --> 02:34:50.692]  I mean, I'm real, folks.
[02:34:50.692 --> 02:34:51.252]  People know that.
[02:34:51.252 --> 02:34:52.153]  This is not a game.
[02:34:52.153 --> 02:34:53.073]  It's not a joke.
[02:34:53.997 --> 02:34:57.998]  And it really is up to you whether you want to see us continue on air.
[02:34:57.998 --> 02:35:02.479]  Because this will fund us for months and months in the future if a lot of you sign up to become members.

[02:35:06.861 --> 02:35:07.661]  Sale ends tonight.
[02:35:07.661 --> 02:35:08.201]  25% off.
[02:35:08.201 --> 02:35:09.341]  It's now available.
[02:35:09.341 --> 02:35:09.941]  Go sign up.

[02:35:12.122 --> 02:35:15.563]  ResetWars.com.
[02:35:15.563 --> 02:35:17.604]  Okay, let's go back to these amazing phone callers.
[02:35:17.604 --> 02:35:18.904]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:35:20.123 --> 02:35:22.644]  That would be Daniel in Arizona.
[02:35:22.644 --> 02:35:23.404]  Daniel, welcome.
[02:35:23.404 --> 02:35:26.445]  You're on the air.
[02:35:26.445 --> 02:35:26.965]  Thank you.
[02:35:26.965 --> 02:35:32.807]  I want to share a single point that will take care, will kill a lot of birds with one stone.
[02:35:32.807 --> 02:35:36.929]  It's regenerative agriculture and it is related to government.
[02:35:36.929 --> 02:35:42.010]  It should be putting forth policy that creates independence and not dependence.
[02:35:42.010 --> 02:35:46.112]  This is a transfer of power from the people to the government, which is tyranny.
[02:35:47.538 --> 02:35:59.247]  So, regenerative agriculture would get the left on our side because it negates CO2 climate change, because it sequesters CO2 from the atmosphere by itself.
[02:35:59.247 --> 02:36:05.772]  No cows have to stop farting, no cars have to stop driving, and that would negate the need for the panopticon.
[02:36:05.772 --> 02:36:08.454]  Well, sounds like you know what you're talking about.
[02:36:08.454 --> 02:36:10.316]  Yeah, it negates the control grid.
[02:36:10.316 --> 02:36:13.919]  So what is the answer to get the left to not destroy themselves?
[02:36:13.919 --> 02:36:15.320]  How do we get them to not commit suicide?
[02:36:16.852 --> 02:36:29.920]  I'm saying regenerative agriculture, and if we instantiate that through law, we can criminalize people like GMO farmers who are destroying the soil, which the healthy soil does not sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:44.729]  If everyone did regenerative agriculture, we would stabilize CO2 levels in five years, which means that everyone who's not doing regenerative agriculture, which is all the GMO farmers who are spraying their soils with things that kill the biology in the soil,
[02:36:46.009 --> 02:36:49.550]  I get what you're saying, and I've researched this, you're right.
[02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:56.372]  If we even take their idea that carbon dioxide at high levels is bad, there's ways to fix it, but they're not doing that.
[02:36:56.372 --> 02:36:58.513]  So explain what you're saying.
[02:36:58.513 --> 02:37:01.653]  Regenerative agriculture is very simple.
[02:37:01.653 --> 02:37:06.495]  It's just rebuilding the soil food web, the biology, the microbiology, the whole food web.
[02:37:06.495 --> 02:37:06.755]  Absolutely.
[02:37:06.755 --> 02:37:10.636]  Soil is supposed to be alive, or it goes away and dies, you get a desert.
[02:37:11.866 --> 02:37:17.728]  So, when you bring the life back to the soil, the soil takes care of itself.
[02:37:17.728 --> 02:37:20.649]  All the minerals are already in the sand, pebbles, and rocks.
[02:37:20.649 --> 02:37:22.089]  You don't need to put any minerals in there.
[02:37:22.089 --> 02:37:24.210]  You have an infinitude of minerals.
[02:37:24.210 --> 02:37:27.091]  All you need is the soil to make it bioavailable for the plants.
[02:37:27.091 --> 02:37:35.093]  Now, everyone who's not doing that is contributing to what they call the death of the plant, the end of the world, and they should be packed up.
[02:37:35.093 --> 02:37:36.754]  Bill Gates wants to ban organic farming.
[02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:40.660]  So they want more chemical farming, more pesticides, which is sick.
[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:42.283]  So they're the ones claiming they're the guardians.
[02:37:42.283 --> 02:37:45.449]  I researched this, you're right, when actually they're the ones killing the plant.
[02:37:46.258 --> 02:37:50.439]  They taxed the coal power plants out of existence because they said they're going to end the world.
[02:37:50.439 --> 02:37:52.220]  Okay, they're ending the world.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:57.341]  They need to be taxed out of existence, which means we need to have organic farming all over the United States.
[02:37:57.341 --> 02:38:00.122]  Bill Gates cannot farm anything.
[02:38:00.122 --> 02:38:01.662]  So that takes... Exactly.
[02:38:01.662 --> 02:38:04.523]  For those that don't know, Bill Gates wants chemical farming.
[02:38:04.523 --> 02:38:06.003]  He wants to ban organic.
[02:38:06.003 --> 02:38:07.624]  He claims organic farming is bad.
[02:38:08.863 --> 02:38:25.508]  So that takes out GMO, it takes out the panopticonic surveillance grid, it takes out CO2 taxation, it takes out the banning of cars and planes, it gives us all healthier food, happier planet, happier animals.
[02:38:25.508 --> 02:38:28.368]  I hear you Daniel, thank you so much, we love you.
[02:38:28.368 --> 02:38:32.229]  Kyle in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead Kyle.
[02:38:32.229 --> 02:38:33.670]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.950]  Yes sir.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:37.080]  So I wanted to share a story about my father.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:43.081]  He actually passed about two or three years ago, and he was sick with cancer for six years.
[02:38:43.081 --> 02:39:02.265]  And as sad as it is, I can tell you that this last 18 months has made me extremely grateful that he went when he did, because his quality of life, he was able to go on vacations with his family, and he was able to see his family and friends and pass around his family and friends.
[02:39:03.214 --> 02:39:07.097]  Where I'm going with this is it will come full circle when the people who did not want to take these injections
[02:39:23.405 --> 02:39:26.928]  And felt forced to take these injections by their employers.
[02:39:26.928 --> 02:39:31.451]  There's a groundswell happening that maybe these employers are extremely out of touch.
[02:39:31.451 --> 02:39:37.876]  These giant, you know, Forbes companies, these, you know, the top 300 or 500... Are you talking about the 90-day club?
[02:39:37.876 --> 02:39:40.318]  Uh, no.
[02:39:40.318 --> 02:39:40.858]  No.
[02:39:40.858 --> 02:39:43.000]  Well, the 90-day club is people that have 90 days to live.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.823]  The people that have been killed by these shots, what's going to happen when they figure it out and go after the people that made them take them?
[02:39:47.823 --> 02:39:48.824]  Have you thought about that?
[02:39:49.855 --> 02:39:56.924]  I believe that these corporations are only holding on to this mandate because they don't know what to do when they repeal them.
[02:39:56.924 --> 02:40:02.511]  And these people who only took them to keep their livelihoods are going to sue the hell out of them.
[02:40:02.511 --> 02:40:04.453]  No, I agree, but let me ask this question.
[02:40:04.453 --> 02:40:07.197]  Why would the globalists launch something so destructive?
[02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:08.759]  How do they think they're getting away with it?
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:13.081]  I think they might know something that we don't know.
[02:40:13.081 --> 02:40:17.543]  And that goes back to way back in the day, you were talking about Cuomo out in New York.
[02:40:17.543 --> 02:40:18.843]  Why is he so confident?
[02:40:18.843 --> 02:40:20.284]  What does he know that he doesn't know?
[02:40:20.284 --> 02:40:26.686]  But you know what, Alex, what gives me hope is he went down, people woke up to him, maybe they put someone... Exactly!
[02:40:26.686 --> 02:40:29.987]  These evil people have a confidence hack, that's all they've got.
[02:40:29.987 --> 02:40:34.849]  The truth is, they're like every other evil group, they're about to destroy themselves, we're gonna win, brother.
[02:40:34.849 --> 02:40:36.950]  We just have to protect the children and stop being cowards.
[02:40:37.702 --> 02:40:38.303]  Absolutely.
[02:40:38.303 --> 02:40:46.228]  I appreciate you taking my call, but I really believe there's a groundswell that's happening, and not only the big corporations, these globalists, everybody who's against it.
[02:40:46.228 --> 02:40:47.249]  It's not a threat.
[02:40:47.249 --> 02:40:50.472]  It's kind of a promise, but just wait because the people are waking up.
[02:40:50.472 --> 02:40:51.172]  God bless you.
[02:40:51.172 --> 02:40:52.753]  Thank you so much, Kyle.
[02:40:52.753 --> 02:40:54.735]  Brad in Fort Worth, Texas.
[02:40:54.735 --> 02:40:57.237]  Brad, go ahead.
[02:40:57.237 --> 02:41:02.981]  As a fellow Tiger, 47-year-old born in 1974, I wanted to say God bless you, brother.
[02:41:02.981 --> 02:41:03.861]  God bless you, Brad.
[02:41:03.861 --> 02:41:04.402]  What's going on?
[02:41:05.191 --> 02:41:08.414]  With your permission, I'd like to cover three small items.
[02:41:08.414 --> 02:41:17.142]  I have a piece of new information for you, I have a question for you, and I have a favor to ask, which will include a plug for you, sir.
[02:41:17.142 --> 02:41:17.943]  Well, that's good, Brad.
[02:41:17.943 --> 02:41:19.564]  Let's start rolling.
[02:41:19.564 --> 02:41:23.327]  So, first and foremost, a piece of new information.
[02:41:23.327 --> 02:41:30.214]  Police departments across the country are now establishing what they call a lockbox program.
[02:41:30.214 --> 02:41:31.455]  I've just sent your staff
[02:41:32.091 --> 02:41:47.141]  A note from here in the Fort Worth area, we have a first alliance response group that was started to gather police officers, current and former first responders, as well as current and former military members.
[02:41:47.141 --> 02:41:55.626]  And one of our members made us aware that they are sending out flyers to individuals that live by themselves over the age of 65.
[02:41:57.027 --> 02:42:04.049]  Or that have health issues that live alone, so that they can set up a lockbox to gain access to their house at any point in time.
[02:42:04.049 --> 02:42:06.029]  And I find that very unnerving.
[02:42:06.029 --> 02:42:07.810]  Oh yeah, brother, this is the medical tyranny.
[02:42:07.810 --> 02:42:08.870]  Keep telling us about it.
[02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:11.671]  We've got it on screen right now, the lockbox program.
[02:42:11.671 --> 02:42:21.353]  Yep, and from what my sources say, and what's rumored as people have been joking, well, we can also utilize that program to force vaccinate people who refuse to get the shot.
[02:42:22.222 --> 02:42:24.104]  Well, that's already started in Europe and other areas.
[02:42:24.104 --> 02:42:25.805]  Stay there, Brad, from Fort Worth.

[02:42:26.545 --> 02:42:27.466]  Don't hang up.
[02:42:27.466 --> 02:42:32.410]  And then we'll talk to John in Tennessee, and then Wendy, Laura, and Lee.
[02:42:32.410 --> 02:42:38.855]  And then we're going to end this transmission with Alex Jones and the great Coke Destroyer.
[02:42:38.855 --> 02:42:45.460]  Owen the Destroyer will take over in the fourth hour ahead of three hours of The War Room today.
[02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:48.382]  But I can't stress enough for listeners, we don't sell BS.

[02:43:34.897 --> 02:43:35.258]  Turbo
[02:43:35.618 --> 02:43:36.219]  Thank you.
[02:43:58.308 --> 02:44:02.630]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:13.235]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[02:44:13.235 --> 02:44:19.417]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:19.417 --> 02:44:27.521]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[02:44:27.961 --> 02:44:38.073]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[02:44:38.073 --> 02:44:45.682]  It uses a unique, quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[02:44:45.842 --> 02:44:46.903]  I am a worldly person.
[02:44:46.903 --> 02:44:49.184]  Meaning, I like going to ball games.
[02:44:49.184 --> 02:44:50.984]  I like going to concerts.
[02:44:50.984 --> 02:44:52.125]  I like going to play golf.
[02:44:52.125 --> 02:44:52.865]  I like going out to dinner.
[02:45:07.312 --> 02:45:09.234]  I like the metropolitan life.
[02:45:09.234 --> 02:45:11.255]  I like everything that comes with this.
[02:45:11.255 --> 02:45:17.319]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities.
[02:45:17.319 --> 02:45:20.061]  Get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[02:45:20.061 --> 02:45:23.583]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[02:45:23.583 --> 02:45:25.404]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[02:45:25.404 --> 02:45:27.506]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[02:45:27.506 --> 02:45:28.466]  Just get off grid?
[02:45:28.466 --> 02:45:29.927]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[02:45:29.927 --> 02:45:31.028]  Just live off the land?
[02:45:31.028 --> 02:45:32.409]  That's the survival instinct.
[02:45:32.409 --> 02:45:36.692]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[02:45:37.312 --> 02:45:38.213]  Stay in the city.
[02:45:38.213 --> 02:45:43.895]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notioned that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[02:45:43.895 --> 02:45:49.677]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[02:45:49.677 --> 02:45:54.459]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[02:45:54.459 --> 02:45:56.120]  And so we have the best ones at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:00.001]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:46:00.001 --> 02:46:02.043]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[02:46:02.043 --> 02:46:02.463]  Welcome.
[02:46:02.463 --> 02:46:03.164]  Hello, Alex?
[02:46:03.164 --> 02:46:03.724]  Yes, Malcolm.
[02:46:03.724 --> 02:46:08.048]  All right, I'll make this quick and real short, where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[02:46:08.048 --> 02:46:12.631]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroer.
[02:46:12.631 --> 02:46:15.634]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[02:46:15.634 --> 02:46:18.296]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[02:46:18.516 --> 02:46:20.317]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[02:46:20.317 --> 02:46:25.221]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[02:46:25.221 --> 02:46:31.986]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[02:46:31.986 --> 02:46:33.828]  This is like a very fine wine.
[02:46:33.828 --> 02:46:35.969]  In fact, each batch is different.
[02:46:35.969 --> 02:46:38.371]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[02:46:38.371 --> 02:46:41.694]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[02:46:41.694 --> 02:46:42.614]  That's just how it is.
[02:46:42.614 --> 02:46:43.275]  It's how it works.
[02:46:44.015 --> 02:46:48.018]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[02:46:48.018 --> 02:46:59.684]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[02:46:59.684 --> 02:47:05.588]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.604 --> 02:47:18.605]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, and this is live, Wednesday, December 15th.
[02:47:18.605 --> 02:47:20.626]  Worldwide transmission.
[02:47:20.626 --> 02:47:27.428]  So again, the police, on average, are not our enemies, like George Soros and the Democratic Party want them to be.
[02:47:27.428 --> 02:47:30.308]  They're just a part of the constabulary in our government.
[02:47:30.308 --> 02:47:35.990]  But if the system can bully them into submission and get them to follow orders, they will become, like North Korean police, the enemy.
[02:47:38.439 --> 02:47:40.421]  So there's a battle over police.
[02:47:40.421 --> 02:47:43.905]  Christians, conservatives, libertarians, Americans.
[02:47:43.905 --> 02:47:45.366]  We leave the police alone.
[02:47:45.366 --> 02:47:46.107]  We're going to work.
[02:47:46.107 --> 02:47:46.908]  We're going to the grocery store.
[02:47:46.908 --> 02:47:47.549]  We're going to church.
[02:47:47.549 --> 02:47:48.350]  We're going hiking.
[02:47:48.350 --> 02:47:50.652]  You know, we're going to play pool.
[02:47:50.652 --> 02:47:52.334]  We're not doing anything wrong.
[02:47:52.334 --> 02:47:52.894]  We see a cop.
[02:47:52.894 --> 02:47:55.237]  We're not worried.
[02:47:55.237 --> 02:47:59.021]  But once they become a political officer of the new old order, they become a problem.
[02:48:00.947 --> 02:48:08.093]  And that's what all these purges and all these vaccine mandates, the military and police and medical workers and firefighters and school teachers.
[02:48:08.093 --> 02:48:09.855]  This is about them purging.
[02:48:09.855 --> 02:48:11.496]  It's very simple.
[02:48:11.496 --> 02:48:16.021]  How does the communists purge government without actually taking over and killing people?
[02:48:16.021 --> 02:48:17.622]  Because they know we'd rise up and stop them.
[02:48:17.622 --> 02:48:20.244]  They do it through the vaccine as that pretext.
[02:48:20.244 --> 02:48:22.306]  And they brag all over the world.
[02:48:22.306 --> 02:48:25.209]  This is just the beginning of them getting their people in place.
[02:48:27.836 --> 02:48:29.038]  So how do you respond to that?
[02:48:29.038 --> 02:48:39.510]  You go to your city council, you go to your county commissioner, you go to your school boards, you go to your legislatures, you go to Congress peacefully, and you lay out the reality of what's happening and you say no to the system.
[02:48:42.975 --> 02:48:44.756]  And then the whole thing falls apart.
[02:48:44.756 --> 02:48:46.216]  That's why they wanted to send the FBI.
[02:48:46.216 --> 02:48:51.679]  Like, well, parents don't like critical race theory being taught and drag queen pedophile time taught.
[02:48:51.679 --> 02:48:56.481]  Just send the FBI to land a helicopter at the school in Virginia.
[02:48:56.481 --> 02:48:57.721]  That'll scare them.
[02:48:57.721 --> 02:48:58.822]  Did it scare the parents?
[02:48:58.822 --> 02:48:59.002]  No.
[02:48:59.002 --> 02:48:59.622]  They took over.
[02:48:59.622 --> 02:49:00.823]  They won the election.
[02:49:00.823 --> 02:49:05.085]  It didn't intimidate them.
[02:49:05.085 --> 02:49:05.965]  So that's where we are.
[02:49:05.965 --> 02:49:07.286]  We're not at war with the government.
[02:49:07.286 --> 02:49:07.946]  It's our government.
[02:49:08.582 --> 02:49:10.563]  It's been hijacked by criminals.
[02:49:10.563 --> 02:49:14.606]  We're at war with the people that have hijacked it and we're going to take it back.
[02:49:14.606 --> 02:49:19.870]  And anybody serving the system who thinks they're going to just sit on the sidelines is an idiot.
[02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:22.171]  You either join evil or you join good.
[02:49:22.171 --> 02:49:23.232]  There isn't some choice.
[02:49:23.232 --> 02:49:27.375]  You're either with America or you're with the pedophiles.
[02:49:27.375 --> 02:49:35.861]  My goodness, the official Homeland Security reports are the number one enemies, people questioning COVID measures or election fraud or open borders or all the rest of it.
[02:49:36.949 --> 02:49:38.431]  So let's go to your phone calls right now.
[02:49:38.431 --> 02:49:39.734]  Brad in Fort Worth.
[02:49:39.734 --> 02:49:42.538]  You're making a great point about, yes, it's actually in the news what you mentioned.
[02:49:42.538 --> 02:49:43.680]  We pulled it up.
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:46.064]  The police are being trained to go, quote, check on people.
[02:49:46.064 --> 02:49:50.350]  Sounds reasonable, except it's a whole takeover system run by the U.N.
[02:49:50.350 --> 02:49:51.612]  and we have all the documents.
[02:49:51.612 --> 02:49:51.893]  Go ahead.
[02:49:53.271 --> 02:49:56.873]  No, you're absolutely correct and I just find this very disturbing.
[02:49:56.873 --> 02:50:07.579]  I think it preys upon individuals who are older or that do not have solid family circles and giving the police access to your house 24-7, 365 is just unreal to me.
[02:50:11.782 --> 02:50:13.984]  They may be doing it because they believe it's a good idea.
[02:50:13.984 --> 02:50:16.046]  It may be for what they call the greater good.
[02:50:16.046 --> 02:50:28.017]  Oh no, it sets the precedent that there's no Fourth Amendment and the state, which won't be the police soon, that Obama's domestic security force, that's just as big and just as strong as our military, has access into your house.
[02:50:29.045 --> 02:50:29.525]  Bingo.
[02:50:29.525 --> 02:50:33.109]  And since they have 60,000 dark troops throughout the U.S.
[02:50:33.109 --> 02:50:38.133]  that are funded by Obama's programs, I would be very nervous about that.
[02:50:38.133 --> 02:50:40.695]  Yeah, they're going to stampede us with the next viral release.
[02:50:40.695 --> 02:50:41.256]  I totally agree.
[02:50:42.336 --> 02:50:42.877]  Absolutely.
[02:50:42.877 --> 02:50:54.225]  So the favor I'd like to ask you, and I want to preface this with, I've been taking DNA Force, Vazobeat, I think is one of your, outside of the turmeric, may be one of your best supplements.
[02:50:54.225 --> 02:50:58.308]  I had high blood pressure before being awakened by you.
[02:50:58.308 --> 02:51:08.216]  I've lost 34 pounds in the last six months, and I'd like the favor to ask with you, and the reason I told you about that is I'd like you to make a commitment
[02:51:09.085 --> 02:51:15.529]  To your audience and to your family to lose 30 pounds only because we love you, man, and we need you around.
[02:51:15.529 --> 02:51:16.390]  I hear you.
[02:51:16.390 --> 02:51:22.834]  Listen, I already lost 30 pounds plus in the last six months, but I lose another 30 pounds and you're damn right.
[02:51:22.834 --> 02:51:25.735]  I just don't know if I can stay up here until 10 o'clock at night tonight if I do that.
[02:51:25.735 --> 02:51:29.097]  I mean, hell, I'd love to go hike or go for a jog or lift weights again.
[02:51:29.097 --> 02:51:36.302]  I already went for a hike this morning with my son, but I would love to do exactly what you're saying, brother.
[02:51:36.302 --> 02:51:37.383]  You've got my promise to do it.
[02:51:37.383 --> 02:51:37.843]  Thank you, Brad.
[02:51:38.743 --> 02:51:39.984]  All right, thank you, Brad.
[02:51:39.984 --> 02:51:42.086]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:51:42.086 --> 02:51:45.149]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:51:45.149 --> 02:51:46.030]  Hey, Alex.
[02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:48.192]  Welcome.
[02:51:48.192 --> 02:51:54.477]  I just wanted to share with you, first of all, I'm just a simple human being proclaiming Jesus as Lord.
[02:51:54.477 --> 02:51:55.438]  I am not perfect.
[02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:59.742]  I'm just asking for some progress in that department.
[02:51:59.742 --> 02:52:05.267]  But I wanted to share with you some experience that I've had recently with some physicians and my wife.
[02:52:06.537 --> 02:52:21.968]  She suffers with a degenerative disease and I believe that that's courageous for her to suffer without handing over control of her body to this world, you know, to all the medicines that are trying to push upon her.
[02:52:22.674 --> 02:52:24.875]  And she's being gaslit by these doctors.
[02:52:24.875 --> 02:52:26.715]  Some of the things... Well, I want to be clear.
[02:52:26.715 --> 02:52:29.576]  I'm not a doctor, and a lot of stuff they have is great.
[02:52:29.576 --> 02:52:33.157]  It's when Big Pharma's making you take something, you better have a question about it.
[02:52:33.157 --> 02:52:37.018]  So, I mean, there's a lot of things the medical system have that are great for problems.
[02:52:37.018 --> 02:52:41.619]  It's just that the globalists see that as their best avenue of control, so they're taking it over.
[02:52:41.619 --> 02:52:44.720]  But, I mean, I couldn't from afar give you my view about you and your wife.
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:45.420]  What do you think's going on?
[02:52:47.289 --> 02:52:51.051]  Some of these gaslightings should be questioned.
[02:52:51.051 --> 02:52:52.751]  There should be a simple response.
[02:52:52.751 --> 02:52:56.353]  For instance, just to trust God to take this shot.
[02:52:56.353 --> 02:53:00.114]  That's not Him, should be the response in your mind.
[02:53:00.114 --> 02:53:00.974]  That's not God.
[02:53:00.974 --> 02:53:05.316]  You cannot place God upon this shot.
[02:53:05.316 --> 02:53:07.337]  You can't prove that anyway.
[02:53:07.337 --> 02:53:08.737]  It's all patented information.
[02:53:08.737 --> 02:53:13.079]  You're not even going to be able to claim that this is natural, ever.
[02:53:13.079 --> 02:53:13.919]  That can't be proven.
[02:53:15.042 --> 02:53:20.284]  So you can't take ownership away from God's creation.
[02:53:20.284 --> 02:53:21.604]  You can't do that.
[02:53:21.604 --> 02:53:23.865]  Well, that's what this whole genetic takeover is.
[02:53:23.865 --> 02:53:26.546]  It's a genetic takeover of our bodies.
[02:53:26.546 --> 02:53:27.046]  Thank you, John.
[02:53:27.046 --> 02:53:27.766]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:27.766 --> 02:53:28.926]  Really good points.
[02:53:28.926 --> 02:53:31.687]  We're going to cram everybody in before this hour ends.
[02:53:31.687 --> 02:53:34.108]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Ohio.
[02:53:34.108 --> 02:53:37.909]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:53:37.909 --> 02:53:40.350]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:40.350 --> 02:53:41.390]  I just wanted to talk to you.
[02:53:43.581 --> 02:53:44.462]  Can you hear me?
[02:53:44.462 --> 02:53:46.263]  I can, yes.
[02:53:46.263 --> 02:53:47.224]  Okay, sorry.
[02:53:47.224 --> 02:53:52.268]  I just wanted to talk to you about how at where I work, I work in an assisted living center.
[02:53:52.268 --> 02:53:52.628]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:52.628 --> 02:53:54.550]  It's a lot like a nursing home.
[02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:56.231]  And don't get me wrong, I'm not a nurse.
[02:53:56.231 --> 02:53:57.432]  I'm not a medical professional.
[02:53:57.432 --> 02:53:58.172]  I work in the kitchen.
[02:53:58.172 --> 02:53:59.453]  I'm a glorified busboy.
[02:53:59.453 --> 02:54:09.121]  But they're training the directors and the managers on basically how to do medication and basically training them to be nurses.
[02:54:09.747 --> 02:54:18.231]  And I'm pretty sure they're even trying to get them certified to be nurses, and these are mainly people who work in offices, who mainly do a lot of the paperwork in the building.
[02:54:18.231 --> 02:54:28.735]  They're training them to do nursing because a lot of their nurses haven't gotten vaccinated, and they're attempting to prepare for if the vaccines are mandated.
[02:54:28.735 --> 02:54:34.558]  They are preparing to let people go, to tell people to stay home, or to fire people.
[02:54:35.727 --> 02:54:43.275]  And they're training the vaccinated staff and mainly the managers and the directors all just how to be nurses.
[02:54:43.275 --> 02:54:44.556]  And they're trying to get them certified.
[02:54:44.556 --> 02:54:48.781]  They're literally taking classes because they're preparing for it.
[02:54:48.781 --> 02:54:52.364]  And pretty soon, I'm probably not going to have a job because I'm not vaccinated.
[02:54:52.364 --> 02:54:54.687]  And I just work in the kitchen.
[02:54:54.687 --> 02:54:57.690]  I just give these people their food and I take care of them as best as I can.
[02:54:58.764 --> 02:55:01.047]  That's huge news and what you're saying is true.
[02:55:01.047 --> 02:55:09.435]  They already have the untrained military in five states doing medical procedures because they fired the doctors and the nurses and the medical workers.
[02:55:09.435 --> 02:55:16.883]  And yeah, you're saying you're a nursing home or assisted living, which is like the level below that, before people go to a full nursing home and then of course hospice.
[02:55:17.383 --> 02:55:18.723]  Yeah, and I just wanted to ask one question.
[02:55:43.095 --> 02:55:46.397]  How does somebody like me, like, how do I get started?
[02:55:46.397 --> 02:55:47.838]  Like, who do I talk to?
[02:55:47.838 --> 02:55:54.562]  Because I feel like I need to speak up more because... Brother, I started out 28 years ago on AXS TV.
[02:55:54.562 --> 02:55:57.823]  So just start a YouTube channel, start a Twitter, start a Facebook.
[02:55:57.823 --> 02:55:59.364]  Go to events, shoot video of it.
[02:55:59.364 --> 02:56:01.505]  Just begin.
[02:56:01.505 --> 02:56:04.507]  The enemy doesn't even know who you are.
[02:56:04.507 --> 02:56:06.828]  You'll build up a huge following before they ban you.
[02:56:06.828 --> 02:56:09.470]  And then you use a Rumble account or a Band.Video account.
[02:56:10.757 --> 02:56:17.183]  Or other accounts to back up what you're doing while you use the enemy platforms to reach people.
[02:56:17.183 --> 02:56:22.427]  You go in like a guerrilla warrior in there, you get them on board, and then knowing you're going to get banned down the road.
[02:56:22.427 --> 02:56:25.590]  So God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:27.271]  All right.
[02:56:27.271 --> 02:56:29.693]  Wendy in St.
[02:56:29.693 --> 02:56:29.974]  Louis.
[02:56:29.974 --> 02:56:31.575]  We're going to come back, go to you next segment.
[02:56:31.575 --> 02:56:34.437]  Then Laura Lee in Ontario.
[02:56:34.437 --> 02:56:36.619]  And then Lee.
[02:56:36.619 --> 02:56:37.220]  And then Jim.
[02:56:37.220 --> 02:56:38.301]  I'll get to those calls.
[02:56:39.130 --> 02:56:43.473]  Before I end my part of the transmission, and then Owen Troyer is coming in here.
[02:56:43.473 --> 02:56:46.115]  Now again, I'm all about solutions.
[02:56:46.115 --> 02:56:46.935]  I'm all about victory.
[02:56:46.935 --> 02:56:48.556]  I'm all about taking action.
[02:56:48.556 --> 02:56:57.442]  And I gotta tell you, I slow down, I lay it all out, I give you the deep info, I break down the MKUltra documents, and I re-engineer it, reverse engineer it.
[02:56:57.442 --> 02:56:59.724]  ResetWars.com.
[02:56:59.724 --> 02:57:01.785]  ResetWars.com.
[02:57:01.785 --> 02:57:05.528]  Right now is the last 12 hours or so, at midnight tonight central,
[02:57:06.178 --> 02:57:11.161]  The 25% off deal stops, it'll still be a great deal of where it's at, and you're helping fund the InfoWar.
[02:57:11.161 --> 02:57:23.349]  It's a fraction of an NFL or George Strait ticket, and it's there, and it's building a whole infrastructure of us to do exclusive Prager University-style reports on every major subject to wake people up.
[02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:31.374]  If you want to be a founding member and found the next level of the InfoWar, as we get ready to explode, then go join today at ResetWars.com.
[02:57:33.635 --> 02:57:39.102]  The course is now live, you can see it right now, and it's 25% off before midnight tonight.
[02:57:39.102 --> 02:57:40.984]  ResetWars.com.
[02:57:40.984 --> 02:57:42.266]  Please take action.
[02:57:42.266 --> 02:57:43.207]  This is The Next Level.
[02:57:43.207 --> 02:57:46.571]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:46.571 --> 02:57:51.677]  So this could be... This could be InfoWars last Christmas.
[02:57:52.543 --> 02:57:55.304]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[02:57:55.304 --> 02:57:57.305]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[02:57:57.305 --> 02:58:01.968]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[02:58:01.968 --> 02:58:03.288]  They're coming after us.
[02:58:03.288 --> 02:58:11.732]  And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent media, in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms of 2022.
[02:58:11.732 --> 02:58:13.093]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[02:58:17.375 --> 02:58:19.256]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:58:19.256 --> 02:58:24.938]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping, then FortWorthShore.com, because I can barely keep our operation going.
[02:58:24.938 --> 02:58:28.139]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.
[02:58:28.139 --> 02:58:29.539]  I am so thankful for you.
[02:58:29.539 --> 02:58:37.502]  And I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us, and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on.
[02:58:37.902 --> 02:58:44.984]  Infowarsstore.com has incredible products, storewide free shipping up until December 20th.
[02:58:44.984 --> 02:58:47.225]  So please take action now and keep us on the air.
[02:58:47.225 --> 02:58:48.025]  Thank you.
[02:58:48.025 --> 02:58:49.345]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:58:49.345 --> 02:58:51.386]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[02:58:51.386 --> 02:58:51.786]  Welcome.
[02:58:51.786 --> 02:58:52.506]  Hello, Alex.
[02:58:52.506 --> 02:58:53.067]  Yes, Malcolm.
[02:58:53.067 --> 02:58:53.467]  All right.
[02:58:53.467 --> 02:58:57.608]  I'll make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[02:58:57.608 --> 02:59:01.969]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[02:59:01.969 --> 02:59:04.970]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[02:59:04.970 --> 02:59:07.591]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[02:59:07.851 --> 02:59:09.652]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[02:59:09.652 --> 02:59:14.555]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[02:59:14.555 --> 02:59:21.338]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[02:59:21.338 --> 02:59:23.179]  This is like a very fine wine.
[02:59:23.179 --> 02:59:25.320]  In fact, each batch is different.
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:27.581]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[02:59:27.581 --> 02:59:31.023]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[02:59:31.023 --> 02:59:31.963]  That's just how it is.
[02:59:31.963 --> 02:59:32.624]  It's how it works.
[02:59:33.324 --> 02:59:37.346]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[02:59:37.346 --> 02:59:49.391]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[02:59:49.391 --> 02:59:55.294]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.332 --> 03:00:05.315]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[03:00:05.315 --> 03:00:07.317]  Mr. Whitley bringing us in.
[03:00:07.317 --> 03:00:10.260]  Let's go to Wendy in St.
[03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:10.600]  Louis.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:11.621]  Wendy, thanks for holding.
[03:00:11.621 --> 03:00:13.742]  Welcome.
[03:00:13.742 --> 03:00:15.023]  Hi.
[03:00:15.023 --> 03:00:15.424]  Go ahead.
[03:00:15.424 --> 03:00:21.669]  I really appreciate everything you do for everyone to help the world.
[03:00:21.669 --> 03:00:24.731]  It really, really matters a lot and makes a difference.
[03:00:24.731 --> 03:00:25.752]  We are making a difference.
[03:00:25.752 --> 03:00:28.274]  All of us are.
[03:00:28.274 --> 03:00:30.076]  I'm calling about reset work.
[03:00:30.678 --> 03:00:34.139]  Actually, which sounds really, really, really incredible.
[03:00:34.139 --> 03:00:47.164]  But I'm calling to ask, because you mentioned MKUltra, the experiments that used frequency specifically to erase the mind and to reprogram people.
[03:00:47.164 --> 03:00:55.047]  And also in light of that, like the Cuba situation with the Cuba embassy and the workers that have like lesions in their brain.
[03:00:55.899 --> 03:00:58.081]  And other bodily symptoms.
[03:00:58.081 --> 03:00:59.762]  Basically, frequency warfare.
[03:00:59.762 --> 03:01:03.866]  And the Havana Syndrome.
[03:01:03.866 --> 03:01:04.326]  Yes.
[03:01:04.326 --> 03:01:20.639]  And so, basically, in terms of remote frequency warfare weapons being used, and in a way that it's also, I think, like artificial intelligence, how we're going to potentially connect our brains to a computer.
[03:01:20.639 --> 03:01:24.523]  I think that that's the way that, according to, like, The Mind Has No Firewall by Timothy
[03:01:25.913 --> 03:01:26.535]  No, exactly.
[03:01:26.535 --> 03:01:30.625]  And that's what Reset Wars gets into, is becoming aware of what they're doing.
[03:01:30.625 --> 03:01:32.730]  Gives you a lot of power over it.
[03:01:32.730 --> 03:01:33.913]  And so absolutely, yeah.
[03:01:35.177 --> 03:01:45.604]  So the question is, do you also recommend basically like a Faraday cage for people?
[03:01:45.604 --> 03:01:49.447]  I personally have told my family I want to move to the country.
[03:01:49.447 --> 03:01:50.507]  My oral offices are here.
[03:01:50.507 --> 03:01:52.489]  I don't have the money to move InfoWars.
[03:01:52.489 --> 03:01:54.250]  But I mean, we've got to get out of this.
[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:55.491]  I mean, it's not natural.
[03:01:55.491 --> 03:01:56.491]  It's not healthy.
[03:01:56.491 --> 03:01:57.412]  We've got the documents.
[03:01:57.412 --> 03:01:58.373]  They're bombarding us all.
[03:01:59.033 --> 03:02:01.876]  And again, if you're consciously aware of it, it gives you some power.
[03:02:01.876 --> 03:02:04.019]  But at the end of the day, it's so dangerous.
[03:02:04.019 --> 03:02:12.729]  But absolutely, I think the whole future is not just putting our cell phones in a Faraday cage to control them and not to track us, but to put our lives in a Faraday cage.
[03:02:12.729 --> 03:02:14.651]  That's why the system makes fun of that and attacks it.
[03:02:14.651 --> 03:02:17.014]  But no, this is their covert war.
[03:02:17.014 --> 03:02:18.236]  It's their covert takeover.
[03:02:18.236 --> 03:02:19.317]  It's definitely happening, Wendy.
[03:02:20.894 --> 03:02:26.038]  Definitely, and I've actually used electromagnetic shielding to stop symptoms in myself and others.
[03:02:26.038 --> 03:02:37.647]  And I actually had a very powerful experience with COVID, which it appeared just like COVID, the exact symptoms, where I thought I was going to die, and I had built this little Faraday cage.
[03:02:37.647 --> 03:02:46.174]  It wasn't a perfect Faraday cage, but it had very thick metal shielding and other metal and shielding material that I could put around me.
[03:02:46.174 --> 03:02:48.075]  And I thought I was going to die.
[03:02:48.075 --> 03:02:48.756]  I crawled.
[03:02:49.748 --> 03:02:57.931]  Off the bat into this caged area that I created and wrapped myself in this stuff and immediately my symptoms like started to decline.
[03:02:57.931 --> 03:03:07.055]  Yeah, there's no doubt that like I've had the former hot top people at Maine Capital and others on they know war start and stock markets crash when there's big solar flares.
[03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:08.871]  And you're like, why is that?
[03:03:08.871 --> 03:03:12.054]  Well, a big solar flare comes out and hits us with radiation.
[03:03:12.054 --> 03:03:15.697]  That's why police know there's triple the murders and killings in a full moon.
[03:03:15.697 --> 03:03:17.979]  It's not just because it's light outside.
[03:03:17.979 --> 03:03:19.541]  It does something.
[03:03:19.541 --> 03:03:23.505]  And, and, you know, the way the sun's energy hits it and mounts us back.
[03:03:23.505 --> 03:03:25.767]  So there's a lot going on.
[03:03:26.863 --> 03:03:32.027]  And it's in all these documents we've got that the system is aware of it, and that's what Reset Wars deals with.
[03:03:32.027 --> 03:03:32.888]  Thank you so much, Wendy.
[03:03:32.888 --> 03:03:35.450]  I hope you become a member at ResetWars.com.
[03:03:35.450 --> 03:03:36.711]  Again, it's going to fund us.
[03:03:36.711 --> 03:03:41.115]  If we were selling hot air, it'd be great, because the input we covered, this is not hot air.
[03:03:41.115 --> 03:03:46.019]  This is hardcore, important information to really get a hold of your mind and think about it.
[03:03:46.019 --> 03:03:47.500]  But it's the gateway to it.
[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:49.262]  But it's incredibly powerful.
[03:03:49.262 --> 03:03:51.083]  They don't want you to have this information.
[03:03:51.083 --> 03:03:51.944]  All right, Laura Lee.
[03:03:53.374 --> 03:03:56.256]  Leah, Jim, I know Owen Schroer.
[03:03:56.256 --> 03:03:57.997]  He's going to take your calls.
[03:03:57.997 --> 03:04:00.599]  He'll be here in two minutes, taking over for the rest of the hour.
[03:04:00.599 --> 03:04:08.685]  And we also have an analysis I did of Reset Wars that people have really been asking for again, so part of that's going to air in this hour.
[03:04:08.685 --> 03:04:10.486]  But I want to thank the crew.
[03:04:10.486 --> 03:04:13.509]  Look, I'm just here battling to raise money to keep us on air.
[03:04:13.509 --> 03:04:15.070]  We sell great stuff to do it, but
[03:04:16.733 --> 03:04:16.913]  I think?
[03:04:39.509 --> 03:04:40.930]  Christmas presents there.
[03:04:40.930 --> 03:04:44.692]  We've got shortwave radios as low as $16 a piece that really work great.
[03:04:44.692 --> 03:04:46.773]  Those are some amazing deals.
[03:04:46.773 --> 03:04:54.418]  All right, we're going to break and Owen Schroer is taking over with Laura Lee, Lee and Jim in a few minutes.
[03:04:56.019 --> 03:04:57.580]  Everything I do.
[03:04:57.580 --> 03:05:02.422]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[03:05:02.422 --> 03:05:04.484]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[03:05:04.484 --> 03:05:09.946]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[03:05:09.946 --> 03:05:11.067]  But we failed.
[03:05:11.067 --> 03:05:12.708]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[03:05:12.708 --> 03:05:14.569]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[03:05:14.569 --> 03:05:20.192]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[03:05:20.572 --> 03:05:29.518]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[03:05:29.518 --> 03:05:35.041]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[03:05:35.041 --> 03:05:37.603]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[03:05:37.603 --> 03:05:40.425]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[03:05:40.805 --> 03:05:42.366]  Get ready at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:42.366 --> 03:05:47.931]  So whether it's a month, or a six month, or a year supply, or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[03:05:47.931 --> 03:05:52.854]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[03:05:52.854 --> 03:05:55.196]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[03:05:55.196 --> 03:05:57.058]  Get ready at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:59.329 --> 03:06:01.130]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:01.130 --> 03:06:03.032]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:03.032 --> 03:06:04.713]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:04.713 --> 03:06:06.394]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:06.394 --> 03:06:10.878]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.878 --> 03:06:12.899]  2022 is the year of the tiger.
[03:06:23.305 --> 03:06:32.872]  The Communist Chinese haven't thrown away all of the ancient mysticism and folklore of China, and they really go off of these archetypal years.
[03:06:32.872 --> 03:06:39.277]  And they believe the best years to launch a war, or to launch a new endeavor, are the Dragon and the Tiger.
[03:06:39.277 --> 03:06:47.082]  But the Dragon in their lore can be seen as turning against you, and though it gives you great power in that year to launch a war, sometimes the Dragon can be a trickster.
[03:06:47.082 --> 03:06:50.545]  But the Tiger is never a trickster, and is the second most powerful
[03:06:51.829 --> 03:06:56.792]  Creature on the Chinese Zodiac, and their leaders really believe in this stuff.
[03:06:56.792 --> 03:07:00.715]  Well, it just so happens that I'm Year of the Tiger next year as well, and that's my sign.
[03:07:00.715 --> 03:07:03.677]  So maybe there is something to it, but probably not.
[03:07:03.677 --> 03:07:06.199]  Regardless, in their minds there is.
[03:07:06.199 --> 03:07:08.300]  And it's all about what your mind believes.
[03:07:08.300 --> 03:07:12.043]  It's all about the confines we put over our minds that limit us.
[03:07:12.463 --> 03:07:17.529]  And so that's why superstitions like what Yuri or Zodiac are so important even to world leaders.
[03:07:17.529 --> 03:07:19.030]  Hitler was obsessed with stuff like that.
[03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:21.773]  Napoleon, Julius Caesar and so many others.
[03:07:21.773 --> 03:07:25.978]  Because by believing in the stars, it allows them to actually believe in themselves.
[03:07:25.978 --> 03:07:28.261]  And this goes into the false constructs and mind control.
[03:07:28.761 --> 03:07:40.249]  So this is the Year of the Tiger 2022 that we're going into, and I want everybody to get the latest information on how we're fighting back and how we're breaking our condition together at ResetWars.com.
[03:07:40.249 --> 03:07:42.010]  Reset Wars is now live.
[03:07:42.010 --> 03:07:43.651]  The course is now available.
[03:07:43.651 --> 03:07:44.832]  Thousands of people have signed up.
[03:07:44.832 --> 03:07:50.256]  We're getting rave reviews back, and there's 25% off running right now for just a few more days.
[03:07:50.256 --> 03:07:53.298]  So we're about to leave 2021 and go to 2022, the Year of the Tiger, and ResetWars.com.
[03:08:05.253 --> 03:08:08.315]  The world is changing.
[03:08:08.315 --> 03:08:11.218]  History is happening now.
[03:08:11.218 --> 03:08:14.681]  The Great Reset is a corporate assault on humanity.
[03:08:14.681 --> 03:08:20.165]  A total consolidation over every aspect of our lives.
[03:08:20.165 --> 03:08:23.307]  But we have the answer to respond to the Great Reset.
[03:08:23.307 --> 03:08:25.169]  It's called Reset Wars.
[03:08:25.169 --> 03:08:30.613]  And it is the combined knowledge of my 28 years on air.
[03:08:30.613 --> 03:08:33.676]  Understanding how the New World Order operates and how to stop them.
[03:08:34.594 --> 03:08:36.617]  Now is the time to be part of history.
[03:08:36.617 --> 03:08:42.606]  If you wait six months or a year to get involved, the situation is going to be a lot worse than it is now.
[03:08:42.606 --> 03:08:48.735]  We have a narrow window to really take on the globalists during their attempt to take over the planet.
[03:08:48.735 --> 03:08:49.977]  They've launched their main offensive.
[03:08:50.976 --> 03:08:56.778]  Once they get their cashless society tracker system in place, it's going to be very hard to get out from under their thumb.
[03:08:56.778 --> 03:09:07.463]  But humanity is waking up all over the world, and there are millions of people every day protesting against the COVID-19 UN takeover, which is, again, the main fear weapon of the Great Reset in their own words.
[03:09:07.463 --> 03:09:14.926]  Klaus Schwab, the head of the Davos Group, who's launched this program, says that you will have to have a microchip under your skin to buy and sell soon as part of your vaccine passport.
[03:09:15.786 --> 03:09:17.747]  This isn't tyranny that's coming.
[03:09:17.747 --> 03:09:18.708]  It's here.
[03:09:18.708 --> 03:09:22.991]  And Reset Wars enables you to not let them demoralize you or break your will.
[03:09:22.991 --> 03:09:24.852]  People ask why my will is so strong?
[03:09:24.852 --> 03:09:27.854]  Well, it's this information that's allowed me to stand against them.
[03:09:27.854 --> 03:09:34.439]  It's this information that God put in all of us that is our shield, our armor, our sword against this fraud.
[03:09:34.439 --> 03:09:35.680]  So I want to invite you all now.
[03:09:36.869 --> 03:09:40.150]  To be part of history and to join me at ResetWars.com.
[03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:43.170]  ResetWars is now live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:43.170 --> 03:09:51.151]  As we prepare to go into the year 2022, such a critical year in these midterm elections, now more than ever, you have to realize the innate power you have.
[03:09:51.151 --> 03:09:59.373]  When you also go to ResetWars.com and sign up for the course, you'll learn about a whole new system that we're building that only members will have access to.
[03:09:59.373 --> 03:10:05.474]  So this is the gateway to a wider world and literally to connecting to the divine and beyond.
[03:10:06.014 --> 03:10:08.357]  It is ResetWars.com.
[03:10:08.357 --> 03:10:09.679]  The course is now live.
[03:10:09.679 --> 03:10:11.020]  History is now happening.
[03:10:11.020 --> 03:10:14.164]  You also fund the InfoWare when you do this, so it's a 360 win.
[03:10:14.164 --> 03:10:18.229]  Thank you all for your past support, and join me now at ResetWars.com.
[03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:20.171]  This information is critical.
[03:10:20.171 --> 03:10:23.415]  If people actually research it, discover how real it is, and then teach others,
[03:10:24.136 --> 03:10:27.038]  This is the secret weapon to break out of their matrix-like system.
[03:10:27.038 --> 03:10:29.060]  Secondarily, InfoWars needs funding.
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:32.643]  We're launching some major new projects in the near future, in just a few months.
[03:10:32.643 --> 03:10:34.544]  We've got all these globalist attacks happening right now.
[03:10:34.544 --> 03:10:39.388]  2022 is the year they're trying to sew up the new world order and take everybody down.
[03:10:39.388 --> 03:10:40.909]  So I need a lot of capital.
[03:10:40.909 --> 03:10:43.851]  And so, the price of the course will go to keep us on air.
[03:10:43.851 --> 03:10:45.372]  So I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:10:45.372 --> 03:10:50.056]  I want to encourage you all now to realize how far we've come together and what we've been through together.
[03:10:50.056 --> 03:10:52.618]  And we don't want all that work to just be thrown away to the side.
[03:10:53.238 --> 03:10:54.099]  Well, there it is up on the screen.
[03:11:20.526 --> 03:11:27.671]  ResetWars.com, the latest in the Alex Jones legacy.
[03:11:27.671 --> 03:11:31.313]  Owen Schroer taking over now for Alex here on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:34.716]  We're going to squeeze in a couple calls.
[03:11:34.716 --> 03:11:39.679]  And we've got a couple other videos that we are going to play as well.
[03:11:39.679 --> 03:11:46.023]  But we've had some callers waiting for a while now, including Leah in Oklahoma.
[03:11:46.023 --> 03:11:47.864]  So let's go to Leah now.
[03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:53.951]  Or is it Lee in Oklahoma or Leah, however it is, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:53.951 --> 03:11:55.351]  Go ahead.
[03:11:55.351 --> 03:11:57.312]  Hi Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[03:11:57.312 --> 03:11:59.613]  It's Leah in Oklahoma.
[03:11:59.613 --> 03:12:01.454]  Alright, thanks for calling.
[03:12:01.454 --> 03:12:07.696]  Hey, I wanted to start by thanking you for all you and Alex do and your crew, for everybody.
[03:12:07.696 --> 03:12:15.819]  And I'd also like to plug X2 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion and DNA Force Plus.
[03:12:15.819 --> 03:12:18.540]  All those products really gave me life back after
[03:12:19.662 --> 03:12:22.084]  Battling some cancer.
[03:12:22.084 --> 03:12:36.596]  Um, anyway, the reason why I'm calling today is because I know, I know a girl that got, um, vaccinated and she breastfed her baby afterwards.
[03:12:36.596 --> 03:12:40.840]  And now the baby is kind of having some complications.
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:47.846]  The doctor actually told her that he has a rare virus called, um,
[03:12:49.722 --> 03:12:52.643]  Enterovirus.
[03:12:52.643 --> 03:12:54.404]  And I read a little bit about it.
[03:12:54.404 --> 03:13:00.927]  Usually it causes hand, foot, and mouth disease.
[03:13:00.927 --> 03:13:03.568]  I guess it's like a rash.
[03:13:03.568 --> 03:13:05.329]  But he's showing different symptoms.
[03:13:05.329 --> 03:13:07.350]  And I read more about it.
[03:13:07.350 --> 03:13:14.133]  And it started mentioning myocarditis and polio.
[03:13:14.133 --> 03:13:18.995]  And I just think that that's weird because, you know, I remember Fauci
[03:13:20.188 --> 03:13:26.050]  Talking about seeing polio-like symptoms.
[03:13:26.050 --> 03:13:38.974]  And I'm just wondering if kids are going to start seeing this from COVID vaccines or if this is from like the childhood vaccines or what's going on?
[03:13:38.974 --> 03:13:48.538]  Well, when we see the anomalies like in child heart failure or myocarditis or some of this other stuff, then we can probably
[03:13:49.625 --> 03:13:55.049]  Say, we can reach a reasonable conclusion that that's directly tied into the COVID vaccines.
[03:13:55.049 --> 03:13:57.911]  They obviously haven't done much research.
[03:13:57.911 --> 03:13:59.372]  They haven't had the time.
[03:13:59.372 --> 03:14:06.097]  They're trying to keep all the research data under wraps as long as possible.
[03:14:06.097 --> 03:14:09.980]  They're saying 75 years before they want to declassify it.
[03:14:09.980 --> 03:14:15.805]  But we have seen an increase in miscarriages and
[03:14:17.270 --> 03:14:22.852]  Women losing their children when getting the vaccine and pregnant, so that's the one anomaly that we have seen.
[03:14:22.852 --> 03:14:28.034]  We obviously know that it causes the COVID injection, myocarditis, and other heart problems.
[03:14:28.034 --> 03:14:32.095]  Specifically in young healthy men, it seems like the most.
[03:14:32.095 --> 03:14:38.298]  So that's really just what we know off of neutral observation.
[03:14:38.298 --> 03:14:41.319]  But as far as what's going to be happening to kids that get born,
[03:14:42.148 --> 03:14:51.313]  When their mothers take a vaccine, or God forbid, two or three even, I'm sure we're going to be learning some not good things in the near future.
[03:14:51.313 --> 03:14:55.055]  And perhaps what you're talking about with your friend is an example.
[03:14:55.055 --> 03:15:02.819]  Have any of the doctors that you guys talked about talked about any of the breastfed babies, or have they not heard anything either?
[03:15:02.819 --> 03:15:06.581]  I haven't heard too much about this, but again, you're talking about a situation where
[03:15:07.512 --> 03:15:13.257]  It's probably the smallest sample study that we have yet, obviously because pregnancy takes time.
[03:15:13.257 --> 03:15:24.987]  So, the vaccine has only been out about a year now, and so how many mothers have gotten the vaccine while they're pregnant and had births, it's still a relatively low number, I'm sure.
[03:15:24.987 --> 03:15:33.655]  So, we'll learn more, and I'm sure there'll be something about it, and we'll find out years down the road, not just the children getting born with problems when the mom takes COVID vaccine, but
[03:15:34.195 --> 03:15:38.700]  Probably a problem with mothers not even being able to breastfeed their babies because of the COVID vaccine.
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:40.863]  So I'm sure it'll all come out soon.
[03:15:40.863 --> 03:15:45.228]  But I might be dead and gone because it might take 70 or more years.
[03:15:45.228 --> 03:15:46.990]  Leah, thank you so much for the call.
[03:15:48.195 --> 03:15:51.558]  I hope that your friend ends up okay, that newborn baby ends up okay.
[03:15:51.558 --> 03:15:52.139]  But you know what?
[03:15:52.139 --> 03:15:52.939]  It's for the greater good.
[03:15:52.939 --> 03:15:54.981]  There's too many humans, so it's probably for the greater good.
[03:15:54.981 --> 03:16:00.026]  What if you could cut your... Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[03:16:00.026 --> 03:16:04.369]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[03:16:04.369 --> 03:16:12.877]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:16:13.217 --> 03:16:29.822]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[03:16:29.822 --> 03:16:40.866]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[03:16:41.346 --> 03:16:49.853]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[03:16:49.853 --> 03:16:55.398]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:58.302 --> 03:17:00.443]  Get our great bag of it here.
[03:17:00.443 --> 03:17:05.026]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communist?
[03:17:05.026 --> 03:17:12.371]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[03:17:12.371 --> 03:17:17.655]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[03:17:17.655 --> 03:17:22.378]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[03:17:22.378 --> 03:17:26.781]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[03:17:26.781 --> 03:17:27.281]  The same stuff.
[03:17:27.381 --> 03:17:33.605]  We sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:17:33.605 --> 03:17:37.768]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[03:17:37.768 --> 03:17:40.870]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:42.651]  Um.
[03:17:42.651 --> 03:17:44.412]  Man, what the?
[03:17:44.412 --> 03:17:45.153]  You wouldn't believe it.
[03:17:45.153 --> 03:17:51.537]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsTore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us and don't want us here, that's fine.
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:01.665]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[03:18:01.665 --> 03:18:11.073]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[03:18:11.693 --> 03:18:21.662]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:18:21.662 --> 03:18:28.427]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[03:18:28.427 --> 03:18:29.868]  But there is only two things to do.
[03:18:30.989 --> 03:18:34.111]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[03:18:34.111 --> 03:18:37.434]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[03:18:37.434 --> 03:18:42.837]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[03:18:42.837 --> 03:18:44.659]  And so, we must prepare.
[03:18:44.659 --> 03:18:46.480]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods.
[03:18:48.782 --> 03:19:11.383]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[03:19:11.963 --> 03:19:15.626]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[03:19:15.626 --> 03:19:22.952]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[03:19:22.952 --> 03:19:27.035]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[03:19:27.035 --> 03:19:29.777]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[03:19:29.777 --> 03:19:30.598]  It's high quality.
[03:19:30.598 --> 03:19:31.679]  It's very, very low cost.
[03:19:32.119 --> 03:19:32.519]  I think so.
[03:19:57.512 --> 03:20:02.135]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:02.135 --> 03:20:03.596]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.596 --> 03:20:27.052]  So, if, thanks to the grace of God,
[03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:32.053]  We hadn't had such great effects and been the Zeitgeist so many times.
[03:20:32.053 --> 03:20:48.848]  I wouldn't expect you to believe me, but I'm always faithful, I'm always true, and I know that if you take the information in Reset Wars and grasp it and really listen to it and really research it, because in the six-plus hours, you could spend a year going into each little piece of it, literally, if you spent all day.
[03:20:48.848 --> 03:20:53.913]  But if you actually grasp it, it's the most valuable thing in the world, better than an eight-year education.
[03:20:54.463 --> 03:20:55.305]  In my view.
[03:20:55.305 --> 03:20:57.689]  And it's at ResetWars.com right now.
[03:20:57.689 --> 03:21:00.234]  25% off until tomorrow at midnight.
[03:21:00.234 --> 03:21:01.777]  But Jake, let's get into it.
[03:21:01.777 --> 03:21:04.202]  People want to know what's in the course.
[03:21:04.202 --> 03:21:06.086]  Go over just a quick snapshot of it.
[03:21:06.855 --> 03:21:08.956]  So last night I was up till 2, 3 a.m.
[03:21:08.956 --> 03:21:10.656]  I went back through the whole course for Alex.
[03:21:10.656 --> 03:21:16.258]  He asked me to break down everything and just go straight so you know what you're getting.
[03:21:16.258 --> 03:21:20.800]  So we got Chapter 1 is the Mind Wars and Spirit Wars.
[03:21:20.800 --> 03:21:26.642]  Because the Reset Wars course, Alex actually decided to make it two courses in one.
[03:21:26.642 --> 03:21:30.123]  So you're buying actually two courses, the Mind Wars and the Spirit Wars.
[03:21:30.723 --> 03:21:41.452]  So chapter one, you're going to learn how the war on your mind is being waged and discover the five simple tricks you can use to protect yourself and your family.
[03:21:41.452 --> 03:21:43.133]  This is all practical here.
[03:21:43.133 --> 03:21:52.361]  So part number two, learn how the war on your soul is being waged in the 11 biblical secrets to build a personal connection to God.
[03:21:54.042 --> 03:21:55.263]  Last part, chapter one.
[03:21:55.263 --> 03:22:06.130]  You'll discover three exercises you can easily do on a daily basis to raise your consciousness and protect yourself from the toxic negativity the mass media machine throws at you every day.
[03:22:06.130 --> 03:22:09.952]  Now, one of my favorite chapters is chapter two.
[03:22:09.952 --> 03:22:12.334]  Alex called this one Beyond the Great Reset.
[03:22:12.334 --> 03:22:15.156]  So, as I was going back through everything last night,
[03:22:16.334 --> 03:22:19.538]  My note says, discover what the Great Reset is really about.
[03:22:19.538 --> 03:22:23.604]  Hint, it has nothing to do with one world government.
[03:22:23.604 --> 03:22:25.546]  It's even more sinister.
[03:22:25.546 --> 03:22:29.592]  And if you do not learn, you cannot protect yourself and your family.
[03:22:29.592 --> 03:22:34.058]  This is really what Klaus Schwab and Mark Zuckerberg don't want you to know.
[03:22:34.815 --> 03:22:38.778]  Then, Alex goes into the nature of reality in Chapter 3.
[03:22:38.778 --> 03:22:46.223]  So Chapter 3 is about uncovering the truth about the quantum physics, the science of consciousness, and the true nature of reality.
[03:22:46.223 --> 03:22:48.524]  And Jake, for me, this is my favorite chapter.
[03:22:48.524 --> 03:22:49.705]  I agree.
[03:22:49.705 --> 03:22:52.747]  And I really like Chapter 8 or 9 when you get into God.
[03:22:52.747 --> 03:22:54.068]  And we close it all out there.
[03:22:54.068 --> 03:22:54.688]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:22:56.610 --> 03:23:09.026]  You're going to learn how to apply, this is huge here, you're going to learn how to apply Nobel Prize winning physicists and mathematicians discoveries in order to create your own reality.
[03:23:09.762 --> 03:23:15.623]  Learn the hidden teachings of Albert Einstein and how to use them to master your consciousness.
[03:23:15.623 --> 03:23:24.426]  You're going to see the scientific proof behind your connection to God and what the elite do to ruin this bond for you every single day.
[03:23:24.426 --> 03:23:28.707]  And that's why this whole course is practical about protecting yourself, your friends, your family.
[03:23:28.707 --> 03:23:31.627]  This is what Dr. Zelenko talks about, God consciousness.
[03:23:31.627 --> 03:23:32.508]  You have it.
[03:23:32.508 --> 03:23:34.968]  We're simply pointing out exercises to get there.
[03:23:34.968 --> 03:23:35.448]  Yep.
[03:23:35.448 --> 03:23:36.169]  Reconnect.
[03:23:36.169 --> 03:23:37.049]  It's there.
[03:23:37.049 --> 03:23:37.789]  God's knocking.
[03:23:39.088 --> 03:23:39.949]  You gotta open the door.
[03:23:39.949 --> 03:23:41.371]  Yeah, this is all practical.
[03:23:41.371 --> 03:23:42.813]  This is not theory.
[03:23:42.813 --> 03:23:45.196]  This is set up in such an empowering way.
[03:23:45.196 --> 03:23:47.439]  This is a super weapon for goodness, folks.
[03:23:48.030 --> 03:23:48.370]  Believe it.
[03:23:48.370 --> 03:23:50.711]  They're freaking out over this right now.
[03:23:50.711 --> 03:23:52.472]  So forgiveness is chapter 7.
[03:23:52.472 --> 03:24:01.137]  This one's a really cool chapter because you're going to find out how to let go of unconscious negative emotions that are keeping you anxious.
[03:24:01.137 --> 03:24:02.878]  What they did to you is what they did.
[03:24:02.878 --> 03:24:04.819]  By hating them, you're giving them power.
[03:24:04.819 --> 03:24:07.980]  You don't get weak forgiving them.
[03:24:07.980 --> 03:24:09.561]  Turning loose of this makes you stronger.
[03:24:09.981 --> 03:24:13.822]  Yeah, and you're watching this, you know what's happening in the world, right?
[03:24:13.822 --> 03:24:16.003]  And it's very easy when you know what's happening in the world.
[03:24:16.003 --> 03:24:17.083]  That's why we're having a race war.
[03:24:17.083 --> 03:24:30.427]  We get mad, we're angry about it, we're upset about it, and rightfully so, but that's what traps us in the emotional control grid, which is the term Alex coined in the course, about trapping you in the mental and emotional plane, and that's how they keep the Matrix going.
[03:24:30.427 --> 03:24:32.007]  So he shows how to break out of that.
[03:24:32.367 --> 03:24:42.832]  You're going to learn Alex's literal, his personal story of how he overcame his hatred of the globalists and learned to forgive them so it would not destroy his life with anger anymore.
[03:24:42.832 --> 03:24:49.154]  You're going to practice simple exercises of forgiveness that will instantly make you happier and heal your personal relationships.
[03:24:49.154 --> 03:24:56.898]  Learn how to take your anger and stress and transmute that energy into creativity so you can change your life and defeat the Great Reset.
[03:24:56.898 --> 03:24:57.638]  This is important.
[03:24:58.118 --> 03:25:00.161]  It's about the transmutation of energy.
[03:25:00.161 --> 03:25:02.543]  Energy's never created or destroyed earlier in the course.
[03:25:02.543 --> 03:25:04.666]  That's why he says, we'll make you angry, we control you.
[03:25:04.666 --> 03:25:05.607]  No!
[03:25:05.607 --> 03:25:07.809]  Anger's fine when you're in control of it.
[03:25:07.809 --> 03:25:08.931]  They don't direct your anger.
[03:25:08.931 --> 03:25:09.431]  Yep.
[03:25:09.431 --> 03:25:11.273]  And this is why this is so powerful.
[03:25:11.273 --> 03:25:12.274]  He says, we will...
[03:25:12.895 --> 03:25:14.716]  Prepare for angry world!
[03:25:14.716 --> 03:25:32.504]  But what Alex has done is broken down these very top-level, Nobel Prize-winning physicists and mathematicians to use these laws of the universe, energies never created or destroyed, to take that energy of anger, transmute it, turn it into creativity for creative solutions, ideas so we can defeat them.
[03:25:32.504 --> 03:25:33.424]  And it doesn't happen immediately.
[03:25:33.424 --> 03:25:38.746]  It logarithmically doubles the more your will's involved, and the more you're alive in connection with others that agree with you.
[03:25:38.746 --> 03:25:41.127]  Then it accelerates.
[03:25:42.848 --> 03:25:48.110]  When we come back from a break, I'm going to get into persistence, courage, God, spirituality.
[03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:51.771]  Alex even has a series of prayers that are incredibly powerful.
[03:25:51.771 --> 03:25:54.972]  We're going to break all of this down, how to find your purpose.
[03:25:54.972 --> 03:25:56.952]  And so it's ResetWars.com.
[03:25:56.952 --> 03:25:58.313]  ResetWars.com.
[03:25:58.313 --> 03:26:00.333]  We're hitting with everything we've got.
[03:26:00.333 --> 03:26:03.714]  I mean, I'm literally putting my guts out on the table, like, how did I do this?
[03:26:03.714 --> 03:26:04.455]  What do I understand?
[03:26:04.455 --> 03:26:05.835]  What is my metaphysical view?
[03:26:05.835 --> 03:26:08.236]  This is something outside of anything anybody else says.
[03:26:08.236 --> 03:26:08.816]  This is the truth.
[03:26:11.690 --> 03:26:14.492]  And you can find it at ResetWars.com.
[03:26:14.492 --> 03:26:19.616]  Let me take a phone call real quick before we go to our next break.
[03:26:19.616 --> 03:26:22.478]  And let's go to Laura Lee in Ontario.
[03:26:22.478 --> 03:26:24.279]  Laura Lee, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:26:24.279 --> 03:26:26.081]  Go ahead.
[03:26:26.081 --> 03:26:27.201]  Hi, Owen.
[03:26:27.201 --> 03:26:30.324]  Thanks so much for having me and taking my phone call.
[03:26:30.324 --> 03:26:40.011]  I'm a Canadian podcaster and registered nurse of my own show, The Angel Rock, on a larger network out in New Orleans, Louisiana, called United Public Radio Network.
[03:26:40.578 --> 03:26:44.281]  But the reason I'm calling is for two reasons very quickly.
[03:26:44.281 --> 03:26:47.364]  One of them is just to make people aware.
[03:26:47.364 --> 03:26:48.304]  I'm not seeing enough of this.
[03:26:48.304 --> 03:26:55.551]  You're not going to see it mainstream media that coming in January across North America, they are forcing truckers to get the jab.
[03:26:55.551 --> 03:26:58.713]  I refuse to call it a vaccine because it's not a vaccine.
[03:26:58.713 --> 03:27:01.395]  What that means is very quickly.
[03:27:01.395 --> 03:27:02.977]  And there was somebody that made a video.
[03:27:02.977 --> 03:27:04.338]  I was just sent today.
[03:27:04.338 --> 03:27:06.860]  Even if 15 percent of truckers lose their jobs.
[03:27:07.580 --> 03:27:10.681]  That is very quickly going to affect supply and demand.
[03:27:10.681 --> 03:27:13.783]  So it's not to scare people, it's to give people a heads up.
[03:27:13.783 --> 03:27:19.465]  If you haven't prepared already, now's the time to start getting what you need in the way of essentials.
[03:27:19.465 --> 03:27:25.407]  Because if the truckers aren't there, we're not going to be getting what we get on our shelves, even stuff we order online.
[03:27:25.407 --> 03:27:36.412]  See, here's the problem is, it's hard to convince people to have a sense of urgency because the sense of urgency is such a fight or flight response mechanism.
[03:27:37.853 --> 03:27:42.295]  Where, for us here, we're in the crosshairs of the New World Order.
[03:27:42.295 --> 03:27:43.836]  I mean, we're being persecuted.
[03:27:43.836 --> 03:27:45.937]  I mean, I don't need to get into everything that goes on.
[03:27:45.937 --> 03:27:47.718]  Everybody knows that.
[03:27:47.718 --> 03:27:49.578]  So the sense of urgency for us comes naturally.
[03:27:49.578 --> 03:27:51.199]  Like, we have a survival instinct.
[03:27:51.199 --> 03:27:53.960]  But for most people, it just hasn't hit home yet.
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:54.741]  But it's going to.
[03:27:55.942 --> 03:28:08.865]  When stuff like what you're talking about starts to happen, and people start to see their gas prices go up, and their grocery bill go up, and their energy bills go up, and now all of a sudden, they don't even have all the food that they're used to getting at the grocery store available, because of supply chain shortages.
[03:28:08.865 --> 03:28:14.306]  I mean, people are slowly going to realize, yeah, you are in a war for the planet right now.
[03:28:14.306 --> 03:28:22.707]  Things are not just as they were, or normal anymore, or as the famous line goes, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:28:22.707 --> 03:28:23.708]  Exactly.
[03:28:23.708 --> 03:28:25.588]  The other thing I wanted to add very quickly,
[03:28:26.204 --> 03:28:30.025]  And with being a podcaster, I'm so grateful you talk to people from all over the world.
[03:28:30.025 --> 03:28:35.347]  I use my platform to speak out against the tyranny that's going on in educating people.
[03:28:35.347 --> 03:28:52.854]  But did you know that in the Canadian government website, it's still up there, under if somebody goes to Canada.gov.ca, searches grenades and goes through there, back as far as 2015, the Canadian government was looking for makers of grenades and tear gas.
[03:28:52.854 --> 03:28:53.554]  We gotta go to a break.
[03:28:54.858 --> 03:29:00.160]  You know, listener's call, I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in MFOWL products.
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:03.722]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:29:03.722 --> 03:29:06.323]  And we could never get the ingredients again.
[03:29:06.323 --> 03:29:07.263]  Until now.
[03:29:07.263 --> 03:29:13.346]  And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[03:29:13.346 --> 03:29:17.127]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[03:29:17.127 --> 03:29:18.368]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[03:29:18.368 --> 03:29:23.150]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[03:29:23.550 --> 03:29:23.650]  It's
[03:29:40.128 --> 03:29:40.448]  I think so.
[03:29:55.822 --> 03:30:12.073]  In late August, Infowars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[03:30:12.073 --> 03:30:15.716]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[03:30:15.716 --> 03:30:22.421]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[03:30:23.041 --> 03:30:27.104]  But now, more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[03:30:27.104 --> 03:30:29.865]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[03:30:29.865 --> 03:30:30.686]  It's high quality.
[03:30:30.686 --> 03:30:33.888]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[03:30:33.888 --> 03:30:41.252]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[03:30:41.252 --> 03:30:45.195]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWar.
[03:30:48.257 --> 03:31:01.386]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[03:31:01.386 --> 03:31:10.792]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible, asymptomatic disease.
[03:31:11.412 --> 03:31:21.380]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:31:21.380 --> 03:31:28.145]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[03:31:28.145 --> 03:31:29.566]  But there is only two things to do.
[03:31:30.687 --> 03:31:33.830]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:37.152]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[03:31:37.152 --> 03:31:42.537]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[03:31:42.537 --> 03:31:44.378]  And so we must prepare.
[03:31:44.378 --> 03:31:54.426]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:31:55.547 --> 03:31:59.272]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[03:31:59.272 --> 03:32:04.599]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the New World Order by empowering humanity.
[03:32:05.128 --> 03:32:07.150]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[03:32:07.150 --> 03:32:22.561]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the Matrix, but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[03:32:22.561 --> 03:32:24.803]  It is the true digital economy.
[03:32:24.803 --> 03:32:28.946]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind in transcendental control.
[03:32:29.967 --> 03:32:37.989]  I've been on air 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing, thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[03:32:37.989 --> 03:32:48.551]  But I gotta tell you, out of everything I've done, Reset Wars is the most important, and it is now available, now that the month of December 2021 is here, at ResetWars.com.
[03:32:48.551 --> 03:32:52.751]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[03:32:52.751 --> 03:32:55.052]  The globalists fear this information.
[03:32:57.378 --> 03:33:01.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:01.960 --> 03:33:10.003]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:10.003 --> 03:33:12.604]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:12.604 --> 03:33:14.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.304 --> 03:33:18.146]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:18.146 --> 03:33:21.067]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:25.314 --> 03:33:26.875]  I wanted to let Laura Lee finish up.
[03:33:26.875 --> 03:33:29.797]  She was cut off before the break.
[03:33:29.797 --> 03:33:32.058]  Discussing something going on in Canada.
[03:33:32.058 --> 03:33:35.920]  Laura, pick it up where you left off quickly.
[03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:36.761]  Very quickly.
[03:33:36.761 --> 03:33:38.202]  Thank you very quickly, Owen.
[03:33:38.202 --> 03:33:53.831]  So what I was saying is when you go and you look up grenades on Canada.gov.ca, you can find this far back in numerous places for companies that make these products to submit for Canada's response to COVID-19.
[03:33:55.106 --> 03:34:03.951]  My whole point of mentioning this is they always put out what they're going to do and encourage people to look at your own government website.
[03:34:03.951 --> 03:34:09.575]  Comb through there and see what you'll find because this definitely is a plandemic and scandemic.
[03:34:09.575 --> 03:34:10.955]  Like how did that end up back there in 2015?
[03:34:13.817 --> 03:34:15.798]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it now.
[03:34:15.798 --> 03:34:16.879]  The cat's out of the bag.
[03:34:16.879 --> 03:34:18.960]  I don't even think anybody denies it anymore.
[03:34:18.960 --> 03:34:24.684]  Even worldwide governments are admitting that it came out of a lab in Wuhan.
[03:34:24.684 --> 03:34:39.233]  They get away with massive crimes, creating viruses in labs, releasing them on the planet, and then you have innocent men and women being politically persecuted and tortured in jail cells in the United States of America.
[03:34:39.233 --> 03:34:40.514]  The world is upside down.
[03:34:42.285 --> 03:34:51.953]  Absolutely, that's why it's so important that what you guys are doing there and I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas, all the best in the new year, stay safe and thank you for taking my phone call.
[03:34:51.953 --> 03:34:56.677]  Thank you for calling and the kind words of support and the support over the years.
[03:34:56.677 --> 03:35:04.464]  Quickly now, before we go back to phone calls, here's more from Alex Jones on the latest InfoWars project, ResetWars.
[03:35:05.168 --> 03:35:07.551]  This is another one of my favorite chapters.
[03:35:07.551 --> 03:35:10.394]  Like I said, at this point, I probably went through the course 10 times.
[03:35:10.394 --> 03:35:11.535]  I went through the entire course.
[03:35:11.535 --> 03:35:12.716]  I was up until 2 or 3 a.m.
[03:35:12.716 --> 03:35:14.358]  putting this together.
[03:35:14.358 --> 03:35:15.640]  So I went through it again last night.
[03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:21.546]  So if you're watching this and you haven't bought yet, you know, maybe you heard us talk about it a lot now and you're like, oh, I'm promoting it a lot.
[03:35:21.546 --> 03:35:25.491]  But this really is one of the greatest things I think that Alex has ever said.
[03:35:25.871 --> 03:35:27.973]  Folks, everything we've done has been game-changing.
[03:35:27.973 --> 03:35:29.454]  You've got to get this.
[03:35:29.454 --> 03:35:32.617]  It supports us, which is a winning move, and it's really powerful.
[03:35:32.617 --> 03:35:35.359]  It'll get you focused on stuff you already know innately.
[03:35:35.359 --> 03:35:41.244]  That's all we're doing is countering all the Satanism, all the brainwashing, all the lies, and reminding you who you are.
[03:35:41.244 --> 03:35:42.966]  I know who you are, because I'm like you.
[03:35:43.926 --> 03:35:44.547]  Absolutely.
[03:35:44.547 --> 03:35:50.290]  So we got chapter eight is on the theme here is persistence, courage and motivation.
[03:35:50.290 --> 03:35:59.397]  So you're going to learn the top techniques that Alex Jones uses to motivate himself so that you can find more persistence and motivation in your life.
[03:35:59.397 --> 03:36:00.657]  Because that's what we need.
[03:36:00.657 --> 03:36:01.898]  Everyone's got to get motivated.
[03:36:01.898 --> 03:36:09.743]  Everyone's got to be able to tap into that same place that Alex, that Owen, that the Info Wars crew has been able to do to take on this system.
[03:36:09.743 --> 03:36:11.685]  Just the info here is worth the course.
[03:36:11.685 --> 03:36:11.845]  Yeah.
[03:36:12.105 --> 03:36:14.806]  No, this is a powerful section.
[03:36:14.806 --> 03:36:22.608]  You're going to also hear some hilarious untold stories from Alex Jones' career about how he was able to tap into the power of persistence stories.
[03:36:22.608 --> 03:36:27.129]  I never knew that I was literally bursting out laughing while we were putting the outline together.
[03:36:27.129 --> 03:36:30.170]  They're just hilarious.
[03:36:30.170 --> 03:36:32.331]  We spent months just preparing to shoot this.
[03:36:32.611 --> 03:36:33.912]  Yeah, this is some powerful stuff.
[03:36:33.912 --> 03:36:48.958]  So we got, you're going to practice three exercises that will instantly help you overcome your deepest fears, achieve more success, and find the courage to save America and the world from this tyranny that we're facing.
[03:36:48.958 --> 03:36:51.779]  And it's not like we're just saying that, we're already almost there.
[03:36:52.259 --> 03:36:52.860]  We're almost there.
[03:36:52.860 --> 03:36:55.602]  With the Lister support, you did the same thing.
[03:36:55.602 --> 03:36:56.383]  We're there, folks.
[03:36:56.383 --> 03:36:58.225]  We're almost to the top of the mountain.
[03:36:58.225 --> 03:37:05.952]  Then we've got chapter 9, which is on, this is probably my second favorite chapter, other than the nature of reality at the beginning.
[03:37:05.952 --> 03:37:10.957]  So this is on God, spirituality, and Alex has a bunch of prayers that are really powerful.
[03:37:12.918 --> 03:37:22.682]  You're going to get access to Alex's top seven spiritual prayers that he uses to connect to God to renew his mind and spirit instantly.
[03:37:22.682 --> 03:37:29.865]  That you can do in your own home to protect your friends, your family, and to tap into the Holy Spirit.
[03:37:29.865 --> 03:37:31.246]  So you're going to learn the secret.
[03:37:31.246 --> 03:37:33.767]  I'm going to be depressed, under attack, horrible things.
[03:37:33.767 --> 03:37:36.488]  Just open up to God and realize it's all just...
[03:37:37.408 --> 03:37:38.468]  Remade again.
[03:37:38.468 --> 03:37:39.068]  Absolutely.
[03:37:39.068 --> 03:37:44.750]  So we have Learn the New World Order Secrets About Science, God, and Jesus Christ.
[03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:47.091]  This one will really change your life.
[03:37:47.091 --> 03:37:48.511]  This is what they keep hidden.
[03:37:48.511 --> 03:37:51.252]  This is why Vice News attacked this before it came out.
[03:37:51.252 --> 03:38:00.334]  Last but not least from Chapter 9 is Learn the Number One Hidden Teachings of Jesus That Explain the Nature of Reality and What's Really Happening in the World Right Now.
[03:38:04.719 --> 03:38:08.980]  All right, we're back live now in the InfoWars studios here in Austin, Texas.
[03:38:08.980 --> 03:38:09.601]  Owen Troyer with you.
[03:38:09.601 --> 03:38:11.101]  We're going to take a couple more phone calls.
[03:38:11.101 --> 03:38:16.042]  We've got a couple segments left here, a little bit of time left on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:16.042 --> 03:38:24.885]  And then I've just got a loaded war room coming up today with great guests and a stack of news that's just wild that we're dealing with all of this.
[03:38:24.885 --> 03:38:26.386]  But we go back to the phone lines now.
[03:38:26.386 --> 03:38:28.626]  Jim is dialed in from Michigan.
[03:38:28.626 --> 03:38:30.127]  Jim, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:30.127 --> 03:38:30.487]  Go ahead.
[03:38:35.467 --> 03:38:47.089]  Oh, and there's citizens, doctors, professionals all around the world that have spoken up and they put their self on the line.
[03:38:47.089 --> 03:38:56.431]  We have yourself, Alex, and what gets left out a lot in my mind when I hear people is your crew.
[03:38:56.431 --> 03:39:02.292]  And they're all putting everything on the line to fight this.
[03:39:02.292 --> 03:39:04.673]  And my question is, where's Trump?
[03:39:05.433 --> 03:39:12.879]  And so when it comes to the vaccination, which I'll specify, is he came out and said he took it.
[03:39:12.879 --> 03:39:15.941]  He said his wife took it.
[03:39:15.941 --> 03:39:18.343]  And he's going to stop voter fraud.
[03:39:18.343 --> 03:39:30.152]  He sold the world a lot of benefits because when all this is going on and people are marching and fighting, there were Trump signs all around this world.
[03:39:30.152 --> 03:39:34.416]  And folks are waiting and they put a lot of trust in him.
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:52.768]  And, you know, last week, Stu Peters interviewed Mark Meadows and he promised and Stu Peters made him promise that he would take documents to Trump.
[03:39:52.768 --> 03:39:56.610]  And I don't know who heard that, but I'm waiting for it.
[03:39:56.610 --> 03:40:04.354]  And if Trump and his wife did take the shot, which was the Johnson and Johnson specifically,
[03:40:05.307 --> 03:40:07.789]  Are they compromised?
[03:40:07.789 --> 03:40:10.492]  Are they gonna get sick?
[03:40:10.492 --> 03:40:19.820]  And my question to you, and I have a couple other things, and that's it, I'll let you go, but are they in on this?
[03:40:19.820 --> 03:40:23.203]  Where's Trump, Owen?
[03:40:23.203 --> 03:40:29.348]  Well look, Trump is not above criticism, and there's plenty you can criticize Trump over, but
[03:40:31.295 --> 03:40:42.642]  I mean, when you talk about the skin that InfoWars has in the game, or Alex, or myself, or this crew, it is just not fair to say that Trump doesn't have any skin in the game either.
[03:40:42.642 --> 03:40:45.843]  I mean, Trump is being politically persecuted as much as anybody else.
[03:40:45.843 --> 03:40:48.945]  I mean, he's got the New York Democrats after him 24-7.
[03:40:48.945 --> 03:40:51.767]  They're coming after his taxes.
[03:40:51.767 --> 03:40:53.048]  They go after his family.
[03:40:53.048 --> 03:40:57.710]  Now, again, I understand plenty of frustration with Trump.
[03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:58.591]  I completely get it.
[03:41:00.353 --> 03:41:06.196]  You had the signs at Trump Tower in New York, which who knows if he's even in charge of this anymore, that say you can't come in unless you're vaccinated.
[03:41:06.196 --> 03:41:08.177]  So, look, I get it.
[03:41:08.177 --> 03:41:10.238]  Plenty of fair criticism for Trump.
[03:41:10.238 --> 03:41:21.203]  But, you know, Trump for four years was leading from the front and took all kinds of political slings and arrows and rocks from the corrupt establishment and exposed a lot of them.
[03:41:21.203 --> 03:41:28.787]  So, I'm not going to sit here and obsess over Trump because he was never going to be my savior.
[03:41:30.971 --> 03:41:46.647]  And there's going to be plenty of fair criticism of Trump, but I'm not also going to sit here and throw the baby out with the bathwater and act like Trump never did anything for anybody when he was leading from the front for four years and is continuing to be politically persecuted by the Democrats.
[03:41:46.647 --> 03:41:50.792]  So yeah, he might not be in a jail cell right now getting tortured, but
[03:41:51.744 --> 03:41:54.326]  He's got him up his ass, too, 24-7.
[03:41:54.326 --> 03:41:58.449]  They censor him on the internet now, too.
[03:41:58.449 --> 03:41:59.990]  They come after his businesses.
[03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:03.393]  So Trump definitely has skin in the game.
[03:42:03.393 --> 03:42:10.698]  And I don't think... I mean, saying he's sold out is... I mean, I understand why people would believe that.
[03:42:10.698 --> 03:42:11.238]  Believe me.
[03:42:11.238 --> 03:42:15.001]  You don't think people try to tell us every day what you're saying here?
[03:42:15.001 --> 03:42:18.704]  Or even the notion that, hey, do you think Trump set you up on January 6th?
[03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:33.231]  I want you to know that the difference is that you're out there with your skin in the game, and you might be the one that is in the clink getting tortured.
[03:42:33.231 --> 03:42:34.952]  And I want to know where he's at.
[03:42:34.952 --> 03:42:37.334]  I think it's a fair question to ask.
[03:42:37.334 --> 03:42:39.156]  Well yeah, I'll tell you, he's nowhere.
[03:42:39.156 --> 03:42:40.177]  He's nowhere.
[03:42:40.177 --> 03:42:46.482]  If it comes to me being politically persecuted and thrown in jail, yeah, Trump is not going to save me.
[03:42:46.482 --> 03:42:48.144]  He never was, is my point though.
[03:42:49.531 --> 03:42:54.342]  And so hopefully there's some members of Congress who want to stop the political persecution and torture of prisoners.
[03:42:54.342 --> 03:42:57.829]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding.
[03:42:57.829 --> 03:42:59.874]  This could be in full wars last Christmas.
[03:43:00.734 --> 03:43:03.496]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[03:43:03.496 --> 03:43:05.477]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[03:43:05.477 --> 03:43:10.159]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[03:43:10.159 --> 03:43:11.480]  They're coming after us.
[03:43:11.480 --> 03:43:21.686]  And if we don't support American businesses, and if we don't support independent media, in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[03:43:21.686 --> 03:43:25.108]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[03:43:25.108 --> 03:43:26.849]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:43:27.449 --> 03:43:36.316]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsTore.com because I can barely keep our operation going and I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.
[03:43:36.316 --> 03:43:46.083]  I am so thankful for you and I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment you made over the years in us and I'll redouble your efforts to make sure that your investment in freedom continues on.
[03:43:46.083 --> 03:43:55.410]  InfoWarsTore.com has incredible products, storewide free shipping up until December 20th, so please take action now and keep us on the air.
[03:43:55.410 --> 03:43:55.730]  Thank you.
[03:43:56.130 --> 03:44:07.907]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[03:44:07.907 --> 03:44:11.071]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it worked
[03:44:11.812 --> 03:44:12.412]  Pretty good.
[03:44:12.412 --> 03:44:17.816]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with XT, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[03:44:17.816 --> 03:44:24.761]  So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[03:44:24.761 --> 03:44:28.064]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[03:44:28.064 --> 03:44:28.404]  And over
[03:44:28.404 --> 03:44:34.426]  For the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[03:44:34.426 --> 03:44:36.787]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[03:44:36.787 --> 03:44:38.688]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[03:44:38.688 --> 03:44:40.929]  It'll literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[03:44:40.929 --> 03:44:41.669]  It's amazing.
[03:44:41.669 --> 03:44:42.169]  It works.
[03:44:42.169 --> 03:44:44.670]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:50.913]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[03:44:50.913 --> 03:44:52.173]  Beautifully said, brother.
[03:44:52.173 --> 03:44:54.134]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[03:44:56.129 --> 03:45:02.732]  We have developed the research and the tools to stop this evil and to break free from it and then to help others break free from it.
[03:45:02.732 --> 03:45:05.413]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[03:45:05.413 --> 03:45:20.819]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group of people in the world that are attempting the Great Reset and want a one-world corporate government, then you can learn how to defeat them by learning their war game strategies and how to not play the game.
[03:45:20.819 --> 03:45:22.780]  After decades of intense research,
[03:45:24.119 --> 03:45:29.743]  Our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist bonds is now live.
[03:45:29.743 --> 03:45:32.705]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[03:45:32.705 --> 03:45:36.548]  Start your journey at ResetWars.com today.
[03:45:36.548 --> 03:45:42.593]  They're programming our very subconscious and our psyche to create these false constructs that they then control.
[03:45:42.593 --> 03:45:44.995]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[03:45:44.995 --> 03:45:49.618]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins at ResetWars.com.
[03:45:49.618 --> 03:45:50.459]  Please join me there.
[03:45:55.942 --> 03:46:00.786]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[03:46:00.786 --> 03:46:02.848]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[03:46:02.848 --> 03:46:08.333]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[03:46:08.333 --> 03:46:09.434]  But we failed.
[03:46:09.434 --> 03:46:10.635]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[03:46:11.075 --> 03:46:18.961]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[03:46:18.961 --> 03:46:27.347]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[03:46:27.887 --> 03:46:31.170]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[03:46:31.170 --> 03:46:33.072]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[03:46:33.072 --> 03:46:35.974]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[03:46:35.974 --> 03:46:40.738]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarestore.com.
[03:46:40.738 --> 03:46:46.323]  So whether it's a month or a six-month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[03:46:46.323 --> 03:46:51.227]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[03:46:51.227 --> 03:46:53.589]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[03:46:53.589 --> 03:46:55.451]  Get ready at infowarestore.com.
[03:46:57.188 --> 03:47:06.854]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.854 --> 03:47:09.315]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show, but I will be
[03:47:20.143 --> 03:47:23.806]  Immediately going into the War Room studio to host the War Room once this concludes.
[03:47:23.806 --> 03:47:26.208]  So much big breaking news, video clips to get to.
[03:47:26.208 --> 03:47:30.111]  Biden fumbling and bumbling and embarrassing himself all over.
[03:47:30.111 --> 03:47:34.394]  Project Veritas has a big drop coming tonight.
[03:47:34.394 --> 03:47:35.855]  I don't know what time they're supposed to release it.
[03:47:35.855 --> 03:47:38.417]  It may be released by the time I'm off air at 6 p.m.
[03:47:38.417 --> 03:47:45.103]  Central, but you know, Project Veritas does a lot of big stuff and I obviously have friends over there and
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:51.904]  They'll send me notices when it's about to be a big drop, like big, like shattering.
[03:47:51.904 --> 03:47:56.588]  And they're telling me this one tonight is going to be big and then they got another one tomorrow.
[03:47:56.588 --> 03:47:59.790]  So be on the lookout for that.
[03:47:59.790 --> 03:48:02.052]  Let's go back to the phones for our final caller though.
[03:48:02.052 --> 03:48:04.874]  Let's go to Aaron calling in from FEMA Region 6.
[03:48:04.874 --> 03:48:06.275]  Aaron, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:06.275 --> 03:48:06.555]  Go ahead.
[03:48:08.217 --> 03:48:16.859]  Hey Owen, I wanted to add to what a couple callers talked about earlier, Bill Gates and his GMO food.
[03:48:16.859 --> 03:48:25.701]  A couple weeks ago I did some research on Bill Gates and his GMO food hitting a worldwide restaurant, McDonald's.
[03:48:25.701 --> 03:48:32.283]  What I found was the soil used to grow McDonald's french fries, owned by Bill Gates,
[03:48:33.058 --> 03:48:37.840]  The potatoes used by McDonald's French fries, owned by Bill Gates.
[03:48:37.840 --> 03:48:44.902]  Carrots used for McDonald's Happy Meals, owned by Bill Gates, all grown on his farm.
[03:48:44.902 --> 03:48:51.144]  And it's probably GMO carrots, GMO potatoes, cooked in vegetable oils that are awful for you.
[03:48:51.144 --> 03:48:52.084]  Yeah.
[03:48:52.084 --> 03:48:55.545]  And you know, with the mRNA technology, we don't know.
[03:48:55.545 --> 03:48:59.266]  They might try to give it to the masses here without them even knowing.
[03:48:59.266 --> 03:49:01.347]  And you know, look, when I learned about the
[03:49:03.137 --> 03:49:08.740]  The god-awful diets that we just accept here in the United States of America and all the poisons and chemicals in the food.
[03:49:08.740 --> 03:49:11.741]  I kind of became a food snob for a couple years.
[03:49:11.741 --> 03:49:12.982]  I've kind of backed off that.
[03:49:12.982 --> 03:49:14.762]  I don't judge anybody really for what they eat.
[03:49:14.762 --> 03:49:19.585]  I try to encourage healthy behavior and I think that it definitely should be embraced and celebrated.
[03:49:19.585 --> 03:49:28.329]  Obviously you eat unhealthy, you're going to be unhealthy and now we know, there's no excuse now, we know how unhealthy fast food is, frozen food is, all the synthetic food is.
[03:49:28.329 --> 03:49:29.709]  So there's really no excuse anymore.
[03:49:31.707 --> 03:49:36.909]  There was a story, and I don't know what happened exactly, but they switched.
[03:49:36.909 --> 03:49:37.989]  I believe what happened was in the 90s.
[03:49:37.989 --> 03:49:41.370]  I'm trying to go off memory here.
[03:49:41.370 --> 03:49:49.393]  In the 90s, McDonald's, which was obviously the number one fast food place, but some other places followed.
[03:49:49.393 --> 03:49:55.014]  But McDonald's switched, I think, what oils that they were cooking their foods in, specifically the fries.
[03:49:57.600 --> 03:50:04.683]  It was like there's graphs that once that decision was made, like obesity, diabetes, and all this other stuff started skyrocketing.
[03:50:04.683 --> 03:50:05.864]  And this was in the early 90s.
[03:50:05.864 --> 03:50:08.025]  I don't remember exactly how it went down.
[03:50:08.025 --> 03:50:10.886]  But so there's all kinds of anomalies like this that we can solve.
[03:50:10.886 --> 03:50:12.867]  And so it's so frustrating to hear.
[03:50:13.607 --> 03:50:28.367]  Crooks like Fauci up there just promoting vaccines and big pharmas and masks all day, when we don't promote exercise, we don't promote healthy food and healthy diet, we just promote more poison and then more poison in response to the poison that we're complaining about.
[03:50:29.716 --> 03:50:40.978]  Yeah, it's like he's going to be growing frankenfood, basically, and I think that the people should know what they're eating as far as it not being natural.
[03:50:40.978 --> 03:50:53.120]  So, as I want to finish here, a bioterrorist owning all this soil and the crops that are used to source the largest fast food company in the world, what could possibly go wrong, you know?
[03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:57.161]  He's a depopulationist, so he's coming at you from all angles.
[03:50:59.164 --> 03:51:03.486]  Yeah, and imagine, because what they really want to do is it's all about getting people under the control.
[03:51:03.486 --> 03:51:23.352]  Once they have the climate tyranny in place, you won't be able to be a farmer anymore, and it'll just be Bill Gates and BlackRock that basically makes your synthetic food, GMO food, and you'll just be eating fake food, dying a slow death, not living your full life, being unhealthy, a constant consumer of big pharmaceutical products, constantly in and out of hospitals.
[03:51:23.352 --> 03:51:24.053]  And that's the plan.
[03:51:24.053 --> 03:51:24.953]  That's the New World Order.
[03:51:26.281 --> 03:51:27.842]  And it's for the greater good.
[03:51:27.842 --> 03:51:31.065]  And so we just have to accept it, because we're viruses on the planet.
[03:51:31.065 --> 03:51:32.686]  That's what they want to convince us.
[03:51:32.686 --> 03:51:34.948]  Not a divine creation by God.
[03:51:34.948 --> 03:51:35.849]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[03:51:35.849 --> 03:51:37.630]  Does McDonald's still use beef tallow?
[03:51:37.630 --> 03:51:38.571]  At this time, the U.S.
[03:51:38.571 --> 03:51:42.634]  did not use beef tallow in its fries, but replaced it with vegetable oil in the 1990s.
[03:51:42.634 --> 03:51:45.096]  Yeah, so vegetable oils, folks.
[03:51:45.096 --> 03:51:46.257]  Avoid them at all costs.
[03:51:46.257 --> 03:51:47.718]  Aaron, thank you so much for the call.
[03:51:47.718 --> 03:51:52.402]  All right, we now go one more time to Jake Ducey and Alex Jones on Reset Wars.
[03:51:53.362 --> 03:51:55.805]  We're finishing up with these 12 chapters.
[03:51:55.805 --> 03:52:00.051]  There's 10 chapters, a few extra things, but let's finish up with what is the end.
[03:52:00.051 --> 03:52:03.616]  Mind War, Spirit Wars at resetwars.com.
[03:52:03.616 --> 03:52:08.162]  Yeah, so as you guys know, I'm just, I'm trying to, this would, I could take.
[03:52:08.362 --> 03:52:08.722]  We're good.
[03:52:25.241 --> 03:52:32.264]  And it starts with, discover exactly how to find your purpose in life with practical exercises to help you.
[03:52:32.264 --> 03:52:46.530]  And I really challenge Alex when we're putting this together sometimes to, you know, a disagreement here or there to make every single mini section as practical and applicable as humanly possible.
[03:52:46.530 --> 03:52:49.891]  So you're not just saying, I always just do stuff for seat of my pants.
[03:52:49.891 --> 03:52:51.432]  We re-shot a lot of this three, four times.
[03:52:51.812 --> 03:52:54.494]  Yeah, and not just that, this isn't just theory.
[03:52:54.494 --> 03:53:00.537]  You're getting dozens and dozens and dozens of very specific things he never talks about on air.
[03:53:00.537 --> 03:53:04.260]  Exercises, techniques, tools that he does that he doesn't talk about on air.
[03:53:04.260 --> 03:53:09.883]  It's all organic, and we're codifying how I organically was doing this.
[03:53:09.883 --> 03:53:11.144]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:53:11.144 --> 03:53:12.025]  And that's why I say
[03:53:13.667 --> 03:53:18.849]  And why I'm up here telling you how powerful this is and why this is so important.
[03:53:18.849 --> 03:53:20.209]  Because you're powerful.
[03:53:20.209 --> 03:53:20.750]  Yep.
[03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:22.070]  And that's how we win.
[03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:23.050]  This is really how we win.
[03:53:23.050 --> 03:53:26.012]  First you recognize you're powerful because God made you.
[03:53:26.012 --> 03:53:27.412]  Then you recognize God's plan.
[03:53:27.412 --> 03:53:29.173]  You decide whether you're going to join that mission.
[03:53:29.173 --> 03:53:30.213]  Then you surrender.
[03:53:30.213 --> 03:53:30.653]  Yep.
[03:53:30.653 --> 03:53:32.874]  And that's how we're going to win this thing.
[03:53:32.874 --> 03:53:35.535]  And believe me, if you're depressed, if you're stressed, if you're anxious.
[03:53:35.535 --> 03:53:36.895]  That's why it's called surrender.
[03:53:36.895 --> 03:53:38.636]  Because we've got our own plans.
[03:53:38.636 --> 03:53:39.176]  We get it.
[03:53:39.176 --> 03:53:40.417]  We don't want to be with the devil worshipers.
[03:53:40.417 --> 03:53:41.157]  We surrender.
[03:53:41.846 --> 03:53:42.946]  We surrender to God.
[03:53:42.946 --> 03:53:45.667]  Because we're going to surrender to Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[03:53:45.667 --> 03:53:48.268]  Wouldn't you rather surrender to what created all this?
[03:53:48.268 --> 03:53:51.109]  So we got finding your purpose.
[03:53:51.109 --> 03:53:52.229]  We went over part one.
[03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:58.391]  Part two is find out what your future looks like and how to discover what God wants for you in life.
[03:53:59.411 --> 03:54:04.614]  It's actually a technique you'll learn in Reset Wars that will help you connect to God to find your purpose.
[03:54:04.614 --> 03:54:17.902]  And as a side note before I hit the rest of these is one of the things that I probably learned most just from watching you record this and being around you and talking through a lot of it is your commitment to free will.
[03:54:18.702 --> 03:54:24.304]  And that God has these big plans for you, but it's a God of free will.
[03:54:24.304 --> 03:54:29.826]  And unless you step into this bigger vision for your life, and unless you watching this do, we can't win.
[03:54:29.826 --> 03:54:33.687]  No, that's it.
[03:54:33.687 --> 03:54:37.468]  And it's not like God gives you a program to follow, like the Satanists have an exact program.
[03:54:37.468 --> 03:54:40.349]  If you submit to them, you're ordered under AI to do this exact thing.
[03:54:40.349 --> 03:54:42.590]  No, God goes, here's all this you can do.
[03:54:43.405 --> 03:54:45.346]  But you must do it in this spectrum.
[03:54:45.346 --> 03:54:46.306]  This is my will.
[03:54:46.306 --> 03:54:47.907]  And then you have all this freedom.
[03:54:47.907 --> 03:54:49.427]  Satanists, it's one little path.
[03:54:49.427 --> 03:54:51.628]  But with God, it's just follow the program.
[03:54:51.628 --> 03:54:53.889]  You can do whatever you want in this area.
[03:54:53.889 --> 03:54:56.050]  And once you step into that, it gets stronger.
[03:54:56.050 --> 03:54:57.530]  And like, it becomes a joke.
[03:54:57.530 --> 03:54:59.171]  Like, why isn't everybody following God?
[03:55:00.851 --> 03:55:03.192]  It's what Dr. Zelenko calls God Consciousness.
[03:55:03.192 --> 03:55:06.313]  He's like, this isn't about being Jewish or Christian because I love Jesus.
[03:55:06.313 --> 03:55:06.893]  I love Christians.
[03:55:06.893 --> 03:55:07.593]  He gets it.
[03:55:07.593 --> 03:55:09.354]  I love Jews.
[03:55:09.354 --> 03:55:10.274]  I love Buddhists.
[03:55:10.274 --> 03:55:11.394]  I love everybody.
[03:55:11.394 --> 03:55:12.355]  We love God.
[03:55:12.355 --> 03:55:14.495]  We must transcend with God Consciousness.
[03:55:14.495 --> 03:55:22.898]  Next, we've got, you're going to learn Alex Jones' top five techniques to harness the power of your imagination and the power of consciousness, i.e.
[03:55:22.898 --> 03:55:23.778]  the observer effect.
[03:55:24.438 --> 03:55:28.839]  So that you can make mountains move, and they shall.
[03:55:28.839 --> 03:55:37.742]  You're going to practice the number one technique and method to protect yourself, your family, from the collapse of America.
[03:55:37.742 --> 03:55:40.603]  And that's what this entire course is about.
[03:55:40.603 --> 03:55:42.724]  It's getting your mind and soul ready.
[03:55:44.738 --> 03:55:44.858]  He's
[03:56:01.249 --> 03:56:08.654]  Let me just say this, because I was literally having dreams about this and was physically upset about this, because whenever I'm not doing what I'm supposed to, I get upset, but I figure it out.
[03:56:08.654 --> 03:56:10.756]  I'm like, I've got to expose the AI takeover.
[03:56:10.756 --> 03:56:12.978]  I've got to expose how they're trying to block us off from God.
[03:56:12.978 --> 03:56:14.499]  I've got to expose we have the Holy Spirit.
[03:56:14.499 --> 03:56:15.860]  I was like, how do I do this?
[03:56:15.860 --> 03:56:17.421]  I feel like I need to launch a church.
[03:56:17.421 --> 03:56:21.764]  I need to create some religious manifesto, Christian manifesto.
[03:56:21.764 --> 03:56:24.266]  And then along you come going, let's do a cryptocurrency deal.
[03:56:24.266 --> 03:56:26.428]  I go, no, I want spirit wars.

[03:56:27.468 --> 03:56:28.709]  Well, let's look at it.
[03:56:28.709 --> 03:56:29.570]  It was all meant to happen.
[03:56:30.270 --> 03:56:31.872]  This was meant to happen, Jake.
[03:56:31.872 --> 03:56:33.553]  Oh yeah, no, it absolutely was.
[03:56:33.553 --> 03:56:35.534]  I mean, it's... and that's what I mean.
[03:56:35.534 --> 03:56:49.745]  You have no idea what God has planned for you, how you're supposed to protect your family, where you're supposed to step into, and how you're supposed to... Because you've got to realize that advanced intelligence, that omnipresence is waiting, but it doesn't rape you like Satanist.
[03:56:49.745 --> 03:56:51.406]  It needs you to open up.

[03:57:20.078 --> 03:57:22.719]  How would somebody not bet on something that's defeating the New World Order?

[03:58:49.022 --> 03:58:50.263]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:58:50.823 --> 03:59:03.047]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:59:03.047 --> 03:59:11.910]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:59:12.370 --> 03:59:18.412]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:59:18.412 --> 03:59:23.574]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:59:23.574 --> 03:59:26.235]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:59:26.235 --> 03:59:27.975]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:59:27.975 --> 03:59:37.698]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:59:37.698 --> 03:59:39.799]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[03:59:40.379 --> 03:59:48.692]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:59:48.692 --> 03:59:52.638]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
