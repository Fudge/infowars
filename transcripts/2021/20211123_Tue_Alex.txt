[00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:06.926]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, November 23rd, 2021.
[00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:23.713]  I know a lot of you are tuned in today thinking I'm going to be talking a lot about the January 6th witch hunt committee subpoenaing myself and how they're grueling on national TV hoping I get arrested for something.
[00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:25.634]  It's all part of their globalist communist purge.
[00:00:26.738 --> 00:00:33.182]  And I'm going to cover some of that with Roger Stone in hour number two, but that's not our top stories.
[00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:45.009]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the fact the globalists are gearing up to launch new bioweapon attacks on us and are establishing UN-run martial law worldwide, as we told you they would 20-plus months ago when they launched this attack.
[00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.393]  And they've got all these other distractions and diversions going to cover up the Ghislaine Maxwell pedophile ring story.
[00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.695]  We'll be breaking down next segment as well.
[00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.237]  Paul Watson also joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:58.038]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:00:58.038 --> 00:00:59.780]  Here is a key Gregory's Report.
[00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:12.792]  Before recent headlines, most of us haven't been thinking much about smallpox.
[00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:26.260]  But an important timeline of events published by Cory Diggs shows us how the same foundations, corporations, and NGOs responsible for COVID-19 have been very busy with smallpox.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:42.285]  Since June of 2001, when the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Johns Hopkins, and ANSWER, who was awarded the majority of money for Operation Warp Speed, simulated a smallpox attack on U.S.
[00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.006]  citizens named Dark Winter.
[00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.387]  We're about to go into a dark winter.
[00:01:47.387 --> 00:01:48.827]  A dark winter.
[00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:51.688]  And begin preparing for a smallpox attack.
[00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:01.029]  In September of 2007, the FDA licensed a new modern smallpox vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur.
[00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:09.639]  In 2014, six vials of smallpox are found in a cardboard box at the NIH and transferred to the CDC.
[00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:19.848]  Months later, the first antiviral drug used to treat smallpox was created, funded by Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust.
[00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:34.052]  On October 6, 2017, Emergent BioSolutions, responsible for a vaccine that injured over 300,000 soldiers, acquired the smallpox vaccine contract from Sanofi-Pasur.
[00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:51.118]  In July of 2018, the FDA approves a drug to treat smallpox made by Siga Technologies, who signs a contract to maintain a stockpile of 1.7 million doses of their antiviral drug.
[00:02:51.118 --> 00:03:01.466]  September 3rd, 2019, Emergent BioSolutions is awarded $2 billion to deliver their smallpox vaccine into the national stockpile.
[00:03:02.623 --> 00:03:12.809]  Weeks later, one of only two labs in the world known to store live samples of the variola virus that causes smallpox suffers an explosion.
[00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:19.253]  And the FDA approves a vaccine to prevent both smallpox and monkeypox.
[00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:30.380]  In March of 2021, Merck secures over $300 million from the Biden administration and the Bill Gates Foundation to convert, upgrade and equip their facilities.
[00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:41.862]  In June of 2021, the FDA approves the antiviral treatment for smallpox, which was funded by Bill Gates and the Wellcome Trust in 2014.
[00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:50.946]  In July, Oxford University assists CEGA in expanding use of their monkeypox drugs into the Central African Republic.
[00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:57.789]  On Halloween, Joe Biden signs an executive order to exercise authority over the national defense stockpile.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.023]  Weeks later, Bill Gates warns governments of a smallpox terror attack.
[00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:14.068]  Seven days after that, several vials of smallpox are incidentally discovered at the Merck facility in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:14.068 --> 00:04:19.331]  The very next day, a rare case of monkeypox is discovered in Maryland.
[00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.693]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:24.914]  Well, the
[00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:34.093]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:43.261]  Now the good news is, most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1.
[00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.283]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.

[00:06:14.847 --> 00:06:16.007]  InfoWars.
[00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:17.167]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:25.289]  Today.
[00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:39.092]  It's Tuesday, November 23rd.
[00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:41.773]  InfoWars.
[00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:42.773]  Because there's a war on.
[00:06:44.344 --> 00:06:49.207]  Or your mind?
[00:06:49.207 --> 00:07:09.321]  Well, I am being persecuted along with Owen Schroyer and James O'Keefe and so many other individuals because I'm a loyal American and because I stand against this globalist takeover.
[00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:10.602]  They will not be successful.
[00:07:10.602 --> 00:07:11.183]  They can't be.
[00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.712]  Too many children and others will die under the chemical biological attack we're now under.
[00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:33.177]  The European Union, led by Germany, is now saying the next move will be forced injection with the COVID-19 genetically engineered bioweapon masquerading as a vaccine at the hands of the military and police.
[00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:36.158]  That will trigger a bloody civil war, which has been the plan.
[00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:38.619]  They want an excuse to go around and start killing people en masse.
[00:07:39.684 --> 00:07:42.126]  They're triggering a civil war worldwide.
[00:07:42.126 --> 00:08:01.261]  How did I know 21 months ago, and literally put out hundreds of reports and segments on these shows, hundreds, saying that by the winter of 2021, you'll have them going around starting to do mass arrests of unvaccinated and taking them to camps?
[00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:07.827]  Because it was in the United Nations documents and even the CDC documents, because they follow the UN orders.
[00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:11.537]  They call it the Shield Project.
[00:08:11.537 --> 00:08:16.420]  Now it's happening in Europe, it's happening in Australia, and it's happening in Canada.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.642]  It's happening.
[00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:23.924]  That's a stack right here.
[00:08:23.924 --> 00:08:27.286]  German government says prepare for forced inoculations.
[00:08:27.286 --> 00:08:28.307]  No one will be allowed.
[00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.528]  It's not like we're going to lock you in your house if you don't take it.
[00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:32.029]  We're coming to give it to you.
[00:08:33.407 --> 00:08:37.489]  And the military started arresting and taking people out of their homes that haven't taken the injections.
[00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:39.370]  That's coming up.
[00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:47.334]  The Ghislaine Maxwell trial confirming the Clintons went to the island when they said they didn't and were involved in the trafficking of children.
[00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:48.135]  It's all coming out.
[00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:51.156]  That's why they're trying to distract us with all the rest of the garbage.
[00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.438]  That's going to be broken down.
[00:08:53.438 --> 00:08:57.199]  Paul Watson's going to join us to cover a host of issues at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:57.199 --> 00:09:01.662]  Then, Roger Stone, next hour.
[00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:18.951]  Because he's also been subpoenaed by this witch hunt and what that really signifies and they're hoping to try to claim that if we testify we say something not true and so they can then indict us not for leading an insurrection but for supposedly lying to Congress.
[00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:19.572]  That's their plan.
[00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:23.257]  Will I plead the 5th Amendment?
[00:09:23.257 --> 00:09:26.178]  We'll talk about it next hour.
[00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:28.820]  It's all coming up today.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.704]  And then in the 3rd and 4th hour, we're going to take you into the Matrix with the keys of how to defeat it with Reset Wars.
[00:09:35.704 --> 00:09:38.186]  The first big, in-depth look.
[00:09:38.186 --> 00:09:40.607]  You do not want to miss the 3rd and 4th hour.
[00:09:40.607 --> 00:09:42.068]  Most powerful info ever.
[00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:46.111]  But here's something I shot this morning where I'm calling for a new January 6th investigation.
[00:10:06.797 --> 00:10:09.198]  It's time for the truth to come out.
[00:10:09.198 --> 00:10:16.100]  It's time for the American people to demand a real January 6th investigation.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:25.783]  Because, if you look into what really happened that day, it was a deep state operation that almost triggered an extremely violent event at the Capitol.
[00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:27.824]  The terrible events of that day, as bad as they were,
[00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:28.824]  We're
[00:10:50.246 --> 00:10:53.368]  The January 6th Witch Hunt Committee makes Joe McCarthy blush from his grave.
[00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:32.185]  It is a complete and absolute fishing expedition trying to demonize populist Americans that want our country to be sovereign and want to put our nation first.
[00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:36.088]  It is 21st century mass persecution.
[00:11:37.188 --> 00:11:46.314]  Now, as you've probably seen on the news, it was the top story yesterday, not the man that ran over 40-plus people killing five because they were white, in Wisconsin.
[00:11:46.314 --> 00:11:52.378]  No, ladies and gentlemen, the story was Alex Jones and Roger Stone subpoenaed by the January 6th committee.
[00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.079]  Here's the problem with that.
[00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:59.783]  They will claim I lie about something to the committee, which isn't even true.
[00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:00.303]  I wouldn't lie.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.507]  And then they will have the FBI and the Justice Department indict me for lying to Congress.
[00:12:06.507 --> 00:12:07.768]  I'm not stupid.
[00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:10.031]  So, they've been asking while other people aren't.
[00:12:10.816 --> 00:12:13.699]  I'm 47 years old, don't have any felonies, any of those issues.
[00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:18.083]  I'm a good person, a family man, and I don't intend on spending the rest of my life in prison.
[00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:18.964]  No, sir.
[00:12:18.964 --> 00:12:20.445]  Don't want to have that happen.
[00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:40.155]  I don't want to testify before them because they will lie and say that I lied.
[00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:41.856]  Here's the other problem, though.
[00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:44.656]  I want a January 6th investigation.
[00:12:44.656 --> 00:12:51.979]  I want to know why the National Guard were refused a President Trump when he asked for him on record, and then later the head of the National Guard in D.C.
[00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:59.321]  lied and said that Trump hadn't asked or that he couldn't supply him, and just last week admitted that Trump indeed did ask for him and was refused.
[00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:04.365]  I want to know why half the Capitol Police were sent for, quote, traffic control by D.C.
[00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:07.508]  that controls them that day, and the Capitol had half the police they had.
[00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:12.052]  I want to know who ordered the stand down of the police and let the people in the building.
[00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:19.879]  I want to know about the FBI infiltrating groups and the federal documents that have come out that indeed they did have informants inside.
[00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:26.765]  And they brought the same FBI agent from Michigan who set up the false flag against Governor Whitmer to run the operations on January 6th.
[00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:30.912]  I want a real investigation, but this isn't a real investigation.
[00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:38.986]  They have a few hand-picked Republicans like Liz Cheney and others that are horrible neocons, and they are basically setting up a show trial here.
[00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:43.388]  I'm on air, weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:13:43.388 --> 00:13:43.949]  to 3 p.m.
[00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:45.210]  at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:51.035]  We're still on the air in many ways bigger than ever, telling the truth, laying out the documents, covering what's really happening.
[00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:53.717]  And I really do want to testify to Congress.
[00:13:53.717 --> 00:13:57.040]  And so, if they let me testify live in front of the cameras,
[00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:01.502]  Or depose me on C-SPAN, I will probably do it.
[00:14:01.502 --> 00:14:04.002]  That way they can't twist what I said later.
[00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:18.845]  But I've seen what they've done to other people and there's no way I'm going to go behind closed doors with Schiff and all these other crazy people and swallows well the Chinese agent and let them sit there and claim that I've done something wrong or claim that I lied to Congress.
[00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:20.926]  I want an investigation of them.
[00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:21.926]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:27.127]  The deep state that controls them and ran the fake Russiagate operation also provocateured January 6th.
[00:14:27.987 --> 00:14:29.569]  I don't know.
[00:14:45.592 --> 00:14:47.214]  This country's in an emergency.
[00:14:47.214 --> 00:14:50.277]  They never want us to have a real election in 11 months.
[00:14:50.277 --> 00:14:51.678]  They want to set up this tyranny.
[00:14:51.678 --> 00:14:53.940]  They want to brand their opposition as terrorist.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.802]  They want to have a political purge, and it's wrong.
[00:14:55.802 --> 00:15:02.949]  So I want a real January 6th investigation that's bipartisan, and I would be happy to testify before that under oath.
[00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:11.973]  I'm not a fool, I'm not an idiot, and I'm not about to be set up by the political, globalist criminals in Congress, the Democrats, that have sold this nation out to China.
[00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:24.638]  This whole thing is about distracting from Biden, the stolen election, the gas prices that have doubled, the incredible inflation, the borders collapsing, the pedophile rings running around all over the country, and this whole New World Order agenda selling our country out.
[00:15:25.078 --> 00:15:26.558]  You people are traitors.
[00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.179]  You signed on to the wrong team.
[00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:32.980]  America's awake to you, so good luck trying to put the Patriot leadership in prison.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:41.941]  We're going to peacefully have a velvet revolution in this country of ideology and of culture, and we're already winning, and your New World Order is destined to fail.
[00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:47.742]  Your Great Reset is nothing but the establishment trying to take over and trying to suppress the people.
[00:15:47.742 --> 00:15:50.183]  Your Great Reset will be defeated by the Great Awakening.

[00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:06.358]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:12.643]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:18.327]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:23.911]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save InfoWars.
[00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:31.993]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[00:17:31.993 --> 00:17:36.294]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:37.534]  We don't think so.
[00:17:37.534 --> 00:17:42.095]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:43.616]  But we won't let them.
[00:17:43.616 --> 00:17:46.336]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:06.107]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:09.049]  It's very, very simple, but that most people don't know.
[00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:20.978]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure,
[00:18:21.938 --> 00:18:39.346]  Intellectual property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:45.149]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything.
[00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:55.012]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[00:18:55.012 --> 00:18:56.313]  This is a great reset.
[00:18:56.313 --> 00:18:57.633]  This is what's happening now.
[00:18:57.633 --> 00:19:01.195]  I warn everyone, it's the only way to stop it.
[00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:04.936]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:10.385]  Well, we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast.
[00:19:10.385 --> 00:19:22.996]  Everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very
[00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:26.518]  Future over to them.
[00:19:26.518 --> 00:19:28.278]  They want control of procreation.
[00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:31.239]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:36.980]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.541]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:52.063]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[00:19:53.092 --> 00:20:02.335]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:04.975]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.426 --> 00:20:44.231]  Well, I got really fired up yesterday when I learned that the witch hunt McCarthy 2.0 was after me.
[00:20:44.231 --> 00:20:46.813]  I mean, I knew that was coming.
[00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:49.614]  And there's subpoenas coming in and all the rest of it.
[00:20:49.614 --> 00:21:01.361]  Because we'd already had the FBI and Justice Department, all of them, subpoenaing us and sending us letters and just dealing with it with the lawyers and the amount of money it cost to have them just dig through everything so you certify we don't have what you're asking for.
[00:21:02.568 --> 00:21:04.489]  And people say, oh, well, just it's a bunch of BS.
[00:21:04.489 --> 00:21:05.089]  Don't comply.
[00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:07.310]  Well, then they SWAT team you.
[00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.611]  So let it be known we're not holding anything back.
[00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:11.952]  Don't have an excuse to come here with 40 dudes and guns.
[00:21:11.952 --> 00:21:13.292]  They know that.
[00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:14.913]  That's why they let Owen turn himself in.
[00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:17.574]  Because we're not looking for a fight with the FBI.
[00:21:17.574 --> 00:21:22.976]  If they want to destroy the country and destroy their children's future, we're going to try to politically stop them.
[00:21:22.976 --> 00:21:26.557]  Because we believe getting in a physical fight with them is what the globalists want.
[00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:28.098]  Because we're good Americans.
[00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:43.987]  Understanding that discretion is the greater part of valor, but the deep state with the poison shots and the rest of it is really pushing towards the physical confrontation because they're losing the political war for hearts and minds.
[00:21:43.987 --> 00:21:45.828]  We're winning big time.
[00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:46.968]  This is a football game.
[00:21:46.968 --> 00:21:49.990]  We're in the fourth quarter and we're like 60 points ahead, okay?
[00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:59.981]  Only hope they've got is that our team starts biting and hitting and stabbing the other team so that our team gets disqualified.
[00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:02.762]  They've lost.
[00:22:02.762 --> 00:22:04.682]  They know that.
[00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:06.523]  Their house of cards is coming down.
[00:22:06.523 --> 00:22:13.224]  I'm not the type of person that sits up here like some propagandist and tells you we're winning when we're not.
[00:22:13.224 --> 00:22:15.825]  I've been on there 28 years.
[00:22:15.825 --> 00:22:18.826]  And the first 22 or so I told you we were losing.
[00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:25.239]  The tide began to turn, though, about eight years ago, and in the hearts and minds, we're winning.
[00:22:25.239 --> 00:22:32.126]  And I can tell you, the average person that works in the federal government, whether they're in the military or in the federal agencies, is not a bad person.
[00:22:32.126 --> 00:22:36.310]  In fact, they're more awake, on average, I've found, than the general public, because they've seen the corruption.
[00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.871]  What do they do?
[00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:38.573]  Get out so the bad guys can be put in?
[00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:47.588]  It's a very small group at the top that is executing all this, and a very large group of corrupt Justice Department lawyers.
[00:22:47.588 --> 00:22:51.051]  But the federal marshals, and even the average FBI agent, they're not our enemy.
[00:22:51.051 --> 00:22:53.032]  I don't say that to kiss their ass.
[00:22:53.032 --> 00:22:58.897]  I say that because we don't want to be lured into a civil war, which is what China wants.
[00:23:00.734 --> 00:23:11.943]  I've got so many incredible articles here today, so much, and I sit here before I go live on air after hours and hours and hours and hours of research yesterday evening and today.
[00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:13.604]  I was up working at 1 a.m.
[00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:15.166]  last night because this is important stuff.
[00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:21.401]  And I was up at 5.30 studying until my younger daughter got up at 7 o'clock and I made her breakfast.
[00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:26.343]  I had to take an hour out to hash browns, bacon, eggs, bagels with cream cheese.
[00:23:26.343 --> 00:23:27.503]  We'd just pig out every morning.
[00:23:27.503 --> 00:23:29.184]  I had a great time with my four-year-old daughter.
[00:23:29.184 --> 00:23:31.085]  Because that's where I just recharge.
[00:23:31.085 --> 00:23:33.866]  I spent an hour with her just eating and playing in the backyard.
[00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:36.947]  It was like an eon of just delight compared to all this evil.
[00:23:36.947 --> 00:23:38.868]  But that's what I fight for.
[00:23:38.868 --> 00:23:40.348]  That's who I fight for.
[00:23:40.348 --> 00:23:44.390]  And if I need to die for her, if I need to get put in prison or killed,
[00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:48.808]  Cards on the table, baby.
[00:23:48.808 --> 00:23:49.948]  Chips on the board.
[00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:51.089]  Everything in.
[00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:52.490]  Everything in.
[00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.132]  And it's not even a question when you get to that point.
[00:23:56.132 --> 00:23:57.713]  The fact that they're coming after our children.
[00:23:57.713 --> 00:24:06.999]  So, all over the world they're announcing under globalist control that they're going to start injecting newborn babies with the deadly shots that erase their immunity and just destroy them for life.
[00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:09.681]  It's on record.
[00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:10.702]  So people ask, as a 47-year-old man,
[00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:18.586]  It's been around the world and seen a lot of stuff.
[00:24:18.586 --> 00:24:21.309]  I've been through a lot of pain, which made me stronger, by the way.
[00:24:21.309 --> 00:24:24.272]  All that pain, in hindsight now, is the best part of my life.
[00:24:24.272 --> 00:24:25.814]  Didn't enjoy it at the time, but it made me better.
[00:24:27.228 --> 00:24:34.233]  I would be the biggest coward piece of crap ever if I didn't stand up for children who don't have anybody to stand up for them.
[00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:36.714]  So I'm going to tell you all, you're on the right side of history.
[00:24:36.714 --> 00:24:37.835]  Everybody knows it.
[00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:38.535]  They can see it.
[00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:39.436]  They can feel it.
[00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:50.083]  They can analytically document it all for themselves and we know we're in a time of great evil trying to grab everything it can and take it down with it.
[00:24:50.083 --> 00:24:51.924]  So let me just give you a gestalt of the news.
[00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:58.157]  There is a Breitbart article that I read this morning, but I don't have the full article.
[00:24:58.157 --> 00:24:58.898]  Will you guys print it for me?
[00:24:58.898 --> 00:25:02.541]  Because I didn't print all the pages for some reason.
[00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:08.306]  I've got a Breitbart article that is the most important article of the day.
[00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:13.370]  And if you're a new listener that just tuned in this week or today, you're like, well, wait, you said Rittenhouse is a diversion.
[00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.272]  Well, he's important for the Second Amendment.
[00:25:15.272 --> 00:25:16.313]  He's important for self-defense.
[00:25:16.313 --> 00:25:17.674]  He's a great young man.
[00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:21.037]  But compared to them coming after hundreds of millions of children with poison shots,
[00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:27.518]  His pain is a drop of blood compared to an ocean of blood.
[00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:36.222]  But how China and the Democrats have responded in lockstep together is a Rosetta Stone through which, a keyhole through which you can see their whole agenda.
[00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:37.803]  This is the most important article of the day.
[00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:40.404]  Because you understand this, you understand everything.
[00:25:40.404 --> 00:25:41.085]  So let me hit it right now.
[00:25:42.699 --> 00:25:53.328]  China, in thousands of articles a week, is saying, America's done, America's over, America's so racially divided that we will burn up and be over.
[00:25:53.328 --> 00:26:03.177]  And they're telling investors that, and they're telling other governments that, and they're screaming that from the rooftops and the mountaintops and the hilltops and the valleys.
[00:26:03.177 --> 00:26:04.097]  And who is China?
[00:26:04.097 --> 00:26:09.302]  They're where the globalists have invested, they're where Hollywood's invested, they're where the New World Order has set up their new system.
[00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:13.030]  And China owns four of the six big production houses.
[00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:28.316]  That if you go look at who owns the movie houses that fund all this black-on-white violence movies and whites-are-the-devil shows and all these TV shows and programs, it's the communist Chinese regime, which is the most homogeneous group of people in the world.
[00:26:28.316 --> 00:26:31.558]  And I'm not against the Chinese that, on average, they just want to be with Chinese.
[00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:32.778]  Okay, that's what you're comfortable with.
[00:26:32.778 --> 00:26:34.319]  It's who your mama and daddy was.
[00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:35.099]  It's your culture.
[00:26:35.099 --> 00:26:35.639]  I get it.
[00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:39.121]  You're not bad because most of you decide you want to stay who you are.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.121]  They don't like the Koreans.
[00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:42.141]  They don't like the Japanese.
[00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:43.282]  They don't like the Russians.
[00:26:43.282 --> 00:26:44.402]  They like Chinese.
[00:26:44.402 --> 00:26:46.543]  They're the oldest culture in the world.
[00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:50.425]  And they get that their strength is the fact that they are unified.
[00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:54.287]  So they're financing with the left and paying billions a week.
[00:26:54.287 --> 00:26:55.147]  Billions a week.
[00:26:55.147 --> 00:27:00.130]  There's thousands of programs every year that whites are the devil, kill them, get them.
[00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.411]  And the weak-minded buy into that to divide the country.
[00:27:02.411 --> 00:27:03.111]  That's all it is.
[00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:04.011]  And China brags.
[00:27:04.011 --> 00:27:05.692]  They say America's over.
[00:27:05.692 --> 00:27:08.233]  They will be destroyed in a race war within the next year.
[00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:09.074]  Because that's their plan.
[00:27:10.748 --> 00:27:12.490]  China can't launch nuclear missiles at us.
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.191]  We get in a war with them and destroy them.
[00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:21.837]  But they can release a bioweapon with the China files, Bill Gates and the globalists, and the puppet President Biden they put in.
[00:27:21.837 --> 00:27:25.961]  So, this is the takedown of America and the end of the country.
[00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:41.390]  So, all the Justice Department lawyers and all the FBI and all you can pretend this and say if you get Trump and get Alex Jones and you know get Owen Schroer and get James O'Keefe and if you get us all, you'll be a real boy finally!
[00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.331]  You'll be in charge of the new America!
[00:27:43.331 --> 00:27:43.451]  No!
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.821]  They always get rid of the traitors that help bring down the country.
[00:27:46.821 --> 00:27:49.283]  They never leave you in place.
[00:27:49.283 --> 00:27:54.245]  In fact, I know after you guys have brought the country down, I'll be approached one last time to join the globalists.
[00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:55.306]  I know that.
[00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:57.387]  I'm just going to say, no, I want to leave the country.
[00:27:57.387 --> 00:28:00.409]  If we lose it all, and they'll probably just kill me on the spot.
[00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:01.389]  But I know how this works.
[00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:03.830]  I know how the real elite operate, okay?
[00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.991]  You guys don't.
[00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:07.893]  You kiss the ass of the group taking the country down, and you're fools.
[00:28:08.573 --> 00:28:18.655]  You're the idiots that lower the drawbridge for the Huns to come in at midnight, and the first thing the Huns do after they capture the city is arrest you and slit your throat.
[00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:24.896]  You think the Huns, you think the globalists, you think the New World Order respects people that lower drawbridges on their own people?
[00:28:24.896 --> 00:28:27.137]  You are the curse!
[00:28:27.137 --> 00:28:31.258]  You are the plague, as Cicero said 2,000 plus years ago.
[00:28:31.258 --> 00:28:34.838]  So this article, we'll cover it later, we got a bunch of big guests on, but this is everything.
[00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:38.159]  Our enemies bragging how they're financing all this race crap.
[00:28:41.403 --> 00:28:42.366]  And I'm not stupid.
[00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:43.990]  I'm not going to play into it.
[00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.314]  But it's getting rough, man.
[00:28:45.314 --> 00:28:48.141]  I'm telling you, white folks are getting beat up, stabbed and attacked everywhere.
[00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:53.164]  And the system is there trying to bring this country down and it's so sad.
[00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:58.386]  We need to rally together against the globalists and restore the republic if we have any sense left in us.
[00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:59.807]  Hey everybody, Confused?
[00:28:59.807 --> 00:29:07.050]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:12.972]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[00:29:12.972 --> 00:29:14.393]  Horrible crashes and
[00:29:15.925 --> 00:29:18.208]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[00:29:18.208 --> 00:29:30.302]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfoldworkstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:33.305]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[00:29:34.301 --> 00:29:42.963]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:42.963 --> 00:29:46.424]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.

[00:29:49.285 --> 00:29:54.267]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[00:29:54.267 --> 00:29:59.688]  Clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[00:29:59.688 --> 00:30:01.089]  I know you're humble.
[00:30:01.089 --> 00:30:01.789]  I know you're like me.
[00:30:02.776 --> 00:30:15.627]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:17.409]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.651]  It begins to dawn.
[00:30:22.651 --> 00:30:29.038]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:31.261]  The tip of the spear is Vanda Villion.
[00:30:31.261 --> 00:30:34.384]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is in fullwords.com.
[00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:40.043]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.

[00:30:59.827 --> 00:31:05.332]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[00:31:05.332 --> 00:31:11.617]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[00:31:11.617 --> 00:31:17.302]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[00:31:17.302 --> 00:31:22.867]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save InfoWars.
[00:31:23.567 --> 00:31:30.953]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[00:31:30.953 --> 00:31:35.277]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[00:31:35.277 --> 00:31:36.518]  We don't think so.
[00:31:36.518 --> 00:31:41.081]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:42.603]  But we won't let them.
[00:31:42.603 --> 00:31:45.305]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.
[00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:52.551]  With your support, go to SaveInfoWars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[00:31:53.532 --> 00:31:57.182]  SaveInfoWars.com and God bless America.
[00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:01.456]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[00:32:01.456 --> 00:32:03.057]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[00:32:03.057 --> 00:32:05.919]  Why do they hate America so much?
[00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:13.383]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[00:32:13.383 --> 00:32:14.303]  It's very, very simple.
[00:32:14.303 --> 00:32:26.150]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish, freedom and liberty and due process injustice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.471]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:32.453]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[00:32:32.453 --> 00:32:34.394]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[00:32:34.394 --> 00:32:37.416]  They started a fight with you.
[00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:46.080]  And they're not gonna back down, and they're not gonna go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:52.246]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[00:32:52.246 --> 00:33:02.296]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack, that we have any chance of beating these people.
[00:33:02.296 --> 00:33:04.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.891 --> 00:33:33.865]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.865 --> 00:33:39.251]  It is a real honor to be in the crosshairs of the most evil people on earth.
[00:33:39.251 --> 00:33:42.234]  My flesh doesn't like it, but my spirit loves it.
[00:33:43.766 --> 00:33:45.828]  Because I intend to go into harm's way.
[00:33:45.828 --> 00:33:47.589]  I intend to take on the evil.
[00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:55.695]  I intend to challenge the corrupt power structure because I don't want to be energetically, spiritually aligned with them in any way.
[00:33:55.695 --> 00:34:04.802]  And that means I need to be in absolute opposition to them and I am in opposition to everything the globalists and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates stand for.
[00:34:04.802 --> 00:34:11.486]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us because he has been really doing an excellent job over at summit.news.
[00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:21.293]  And also at Infowars.com and Newswars.com laying out so much here dealing with what happened in
[00:34:22.628 --> 00:34:32.299]  Wisconsin at this attack a few days ago that killed five people, injured more than 40, some of them in critical condition, including children as young as four and five years old.
[00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:35.443]  Literally blood all over the streets, gallons and gallons of it everywhere.
[00:34:35.443 --> 00:34:37.205]  They said it looked like a slaughterhouse.
[00:34:37.205 --> 00:34:39.467]  They washed it away as quickly as possible.
[00:34:39.467 --> 00:34:42.311]  And the news said he was being chased by police.
[00:34:42.311 --> 00:34:42.971]  It was their fault.
[00:34:43.712 --> 00:34:48.096]  And that was totally made up and not true, says the Black Lives Matter leftist police chief.
[00:34:48.096 --> 00:34:56.364]  He was let out of jail, obviously, by a Soros Finance DA that is a leader in letting armed criminals and others out.
[00:34:56.364 --> 00:35:01.830]  And I don't want to read the whole rap sheet of this black supremacist terrorist, but it's long.
[00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:10.200]  Child trafficking, sex assaults, choking, attacking, trying to run people over.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.742]  I mean, he's a regular jihadi.
[00:35:12.742 --> 00:35:24.391]  And he believed he was going out, now the evidence has come out, to attack and kill evil whites that were having a horrible celebration parade they've been having for over 100 years.
[00:35:24.391 --> 00:35:25.612]  So Paul Watson joins us.
[00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:36.190]  To talk about this and to expand on it, there's also a recent Liverpool bombing at a hospital by a Christian convert who was a jihadi.
[00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:47.521]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us to talk about this incredible level of not just attempts at race war and social division, not just here but in Europe as well, the same levels run everything, but all the looting and attacks and
[00:35:47.921 --> 00:35:50.144]  Massive crime exploding everywhere.
[00:35:50.144 --> 00:35:54.370]  Like Klaus Schwab said, they're going to undermine civilization and collapse it.
[00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:55.572]  We're here now.
[00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:56.914]  I just want to cover these topics.
[00:35:56.914 --> 00:35:57.936]  I want you to hit them, Paul.
[00:35:57.936 --> 00:36:02.062]  I want to also do 35,000 foot view before you leave us in about 30 minutes.
[00:36:02.062 --> 00:36:04.105]  Paul Joseph Watson, what's your view on all this?
[00:36:06.141 --> 00:36:18.408]  Well, with the attack in Wisconsin, Alex, you had the narrative being set in the immediate aftermath of the incident by the media, saying that this driver, this massacre driver, was fleeing a crime scene.
[00:36:18.408 --> 00:36:23.612]  He'd been involved in some kind of knife fight, and he was fleeing the scene of a crime.
[00:36:23.612 --> 00:36:28.935]  If you're trying to evade police attention, Alex, because you've just been involved in a crime and you're trying to get away,
[00:36:29.784 --> 00:36:31.905]  What's the one thing you wouldn't do?
[00:36:31.905 --> 00:36:38.328]  You wouldn't drive directly into the main street in the town where the Christmas parade is happening.
[00:36:38.328 --> 00:36:46.691]  The most public place possible, if you're trying to evade police attention, and mow down 50 people, including children.
[00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:51.073]  Not a very good way of keeping out of the eye of the police, is it?
[00:36:51.073 --> 00:36:56.735]  I mean, Paul, you're right, but now they confirm he ran over barricades, he had all the side streets, he was not being followed by police.
[00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:58.556]  It's all a lie.
[00:36:58.556 --> 00:36:58.756]  Yeah.
[00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:01.928]  But they're still reporting that he was fleeing a crime scene.
[00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:04.269]  They're not even asking what the motive was.
[00:37:04.269 --> 00:37:08.092]  You've got an arrest video of him today, which has been released by NBC.
[00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:12.295]  They cut out about two minutes of the video where the police go and arrest him.
[00:37:12.295 --> 00:37:13.896]  We don't know what happened there.
[00:37:13.896 --> 00:37:15.477]  And then, of course, we have his statements.
[00:37:15.477 --> 00:37:17.999]  We have his Facebook profile posts.
[00:37:17.999 --> 00:37:25.164]  We have his YouTube videos, which are all deleted within two hours of the incident, of course, hiding the evidence, which show, as he said,
[00:37:25.996 --> 00:37:27.557]  He was a black supremacist.
[00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:30.418]  He posted violent threats against white people.
[00:37:30.418 --> 00:37:35.721]  He told people to go out and randomly, physically, violently assault white people.
[00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:41.484]  He was doing rap songs on his SoundCloud account about George Floyd and Eric Garner.
[00:37:41.484 --> 00:37:45.586]  He was amplifying BLM rhetoric at every possible opportunity.
[00:37:45.586 --> 00:37:50.588]  He was posting about the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict and saying how angry he was about this.
[00:37:51.169 --> 00:38:02.436]  Just a coincidence, Alex, that someone mows down 50 people in Wisconsin, and he's a black supremacist, two days after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict.
[00:38:02.436 --> 00:38:03.817]  Can you ask the question?
[00:38:03.817 --> 00:38:13.303]  Well, it's also a coincidence that in England and Europe and all over, they had to put up these freedom barricades everywhere because of all the jihadis running over folks with vehicles.
[00:38:13.303 --> 00:38:17.766]  But the news spins it and says it's actually the vehicles, you know, bus attack, truck attack.
[00:38:19.904 --> 00:38:30.550]  Yeah, they say dissolve the borders, well now in London we've got borders on our bridges because about three of them have been used as vectors for massacres by jihadists.
[00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.831]  And another one happened the other week which we're going to talk about.
[00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:35.352]  There's the arrest video that you're watching by the way.
[00:38:35.352 --> 00:38:43.696]  So yeah, imagine if you had a white supremacist, you go on his Facebook page, it's full of confederate flags, it's full of violent threats against black people.
[00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:44.697]  Two days later
[00:38:45.498 --> 00:38:47.980]  He's angry about the verdicts of a trial.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.784]  He goes out and mows down 50 mainly black people.
[00:38:51.784 --> 00:38:59.792]  Do you think the media would make the connection that maybe the motive is that he hates black people and that he's a race supremacist?
[00:38:59.792 --> 00:39:01.273]  They would be all over it.
[00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:03.716]  This would be the top story in America for a month.
[00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:06.557]  And they've basically forgotten it already.
[00:39:06.557 --> 00:39:08.578]  They've brushed it under the carpet.
[00:39:08.578 --> 00:39:15.481]  The police chief who went on a Black Lives Matter march in June 2020 made his officers kneel to Black Lives Matter.
[00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:17.482]  He's brushed it under the carpet.
[00:39:17.482 --> 00:39:18.722]  And basically that's it.
[00:39:18.722 --> 00:39:22.524]  And it's absolutely incredible that they get away with this.
[00:39:23.064 --> 00:39:27.432]  By saying that he was fleeing the police, the police even said he wasn't fleeing them.
[00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:31.259]  Why would you go and mow down 50 people if you're trying to evade police attention?
[00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:33.183]  The narrative doesn't hold together.
[00:39:33.183 --> 00:39:34.986]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:46.584]  And we've now still, as you said, right before I went live, I was in the control room and we got TVs there and you could see them still saying, oh, we don't know why it happened.
[00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:47.344]  It's a mystery.
[00:39:47.344 --> 00:39:49.385]  It's such a tragedy.
[00:39:49.385 --> 00:39:52.526]  For TV viewers, roll the footage from up top a building.
[00:39:52.526 --> 00:39:59.988]  I mean, he clearly is like driving over person after person after person like a Frogger video game.
[00:39:59.988 --> 00:40:01.569]  And then they're saying this is all an accident.
[00:40:03.444 --> 00:40:12.910]  Yeah, you had an eyewitness who said he'd been going down the middle of the road, he swerved and headed downtown, so they said he could have gone down the side of the road where there weren't people.
[00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:20.795]  There are numerous roads that he could have turned off that he could have gone down to avoid the public parade, as he's apparently trying to evade police attention.
[00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:26.542]  He mows down 45 of them, including a dance troupe of grannies, a dance troupe of kids.
[00:40:26.542 --> 00:40:30.428]  You've still got 10 kids in the ICU, Alex.
[00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:36.736]  I agree, but let's compare that to, there's a Black Lives Matter rally that just happened, like 5 people, 10 people.
[00:40:37.657 --> 00:40:43.678]  Precisely, and they said the Kyle Rittenhouse incident was a racial attack where he legally defended himself.
[00:40:43.678 --> 00:40:45.699]  Well, they said he shot three black people on MSNBC.
[00:41:06.772 --> 00:41:10.925]  The Independent literally put on their front page that he killed three black people.
[00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:19.065]  So they told you for 14 months that Rittenhouse had murdered BLM protesters, or even in some cases they said black people.
[00:41:19.065 --> 00:41:26.511]  Meanwhile, this literal black supremacist who hates white people runs over 45, 50 white people.
[00:41:26.511 --> 00:41:28.893]  He's angry about the Rittenhouse verdict.
[00:41:28.893 --> 00:41:32.076]  And it's, oh no, he was just fleeing the scene of a crime!
[00:41:32.076 --> 00:41:35.819]  It makes absolutely no sense, given his profile.
[00:41:35.819 --> 00:41:40.002]  And then you look at the New York Times, for example, Alex, the day after this happened.
[00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:44.924]  They put it on page 22 of the newspaper.
[00:41:44.924 --> 00:41:54.775]  Can you imagine if a white supremacist, again, had barreled through a Black Lives Matter parade in an SUV, killed five people, potentially more, injured 45 people,
[00:41:56.016 --> 00:41:57.738]  Would that be on page 22 of the New York Times?
[00:41:57.738 --> 00:42:02.583]  Well remember when the psycho went and shot poor innocent black people in South Carolina at the church?
[00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:03.424]  That was horrible.
[00:42:03.424 --> 00:42:04.285]  We were against it.
[00:42:04.285 --> 00:42:06.467]  The media said all whites were guilty.
[00:42:06.467 --> 00:42:08.069]  No, that was one crazy person.
[00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:11.513]  The point is, admit it's a bad person, whether they're black, white, whatever.
[00:42:11.513 --> 00:42:12.214]  This is crazy.
[00:42:13.359 --> 00:42:18.162]  Yeah, Dylan Roof, they had his entire motive laid out within 12 hours of the attack.
[00:42:18.162 --> 00:42:22.666]  This guy apparently is just saying nothing, and it's going to have disappeared by the end of the week.
[00:42:22.666 --> 00:42:28.390]  By the way, Wikipedia changed their description of the incident from the Waukesha Christmas Parade attack.
[00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:32.913]  Now they're calling it the Waukesha Christmas Parade car crash.
[00:42:32.913 --> 00:42:34.774]  It was just a car crash, Alex.
[00:42:34.774 --> 00:42:35.655]  Maybe an accident.
[00:42:36.528 --> 00:42:40.533]  Oh, well you saw Schumer say, oh, we're going to build better roads.
[00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:42.155]  The racist roads caused this.
[00:42:42.155 --> 00:42:43.216]  I'm not joking.
[00:42:43.216 --> 00:42:43.756]  You saw that.
[00:42:43.756 --> 00:42:50.764]  We'll come right back and talk about a similar case in the UK of a hospital getting bombed by an admitted jihadi and the news is saying he's a Christian.
[00:42:52.179 --> 00:42:54.482]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the media is the enemy.
[00:42:54.482 --> 00:42:58.407]  It's owned by mega banks that are destroying our countries, that want to get rid of the middle class.
[00:42:58.407 --> 00:42:58.748]  Get prepared.

[00:44:01.383 --> 00:44:09.546]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces.
[00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:17.048]  That the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[00:44:17.048 --> 00:44:21.890]  They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.171]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:28.152]  They know that the people are starting to get wise to this depopulation agenda.
[00:44:29.062 --> 00:44:40.805]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front, and so people are waking up.
[00:44:40.805 --> 00:44:44.026]  The weapons work a little too good.
[00:44:44.026 --> 00:44:48.828]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead, they're making too big of a noise!
[00:44:49.568 --> 00:44:51.689]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.449]  They're coming after our children.
[00:44:53.449 --> 00:44:58.551]  So it's up to us to protect our little children, or God will not look favorably on us.
[00:44:58.551 --> 00:45:01.032]  Remember, God is watching.
[00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:05.333]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:15.517]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[00:45:15.817 --> 00:45:22.004]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[00:46:16.885 --> 00:46:19.207]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022
[00:46:22.935 --> 00:46:23.896]  It begins to dawn.
[00:46:23.896 --> 00:46:30.285]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:46:30.285 --> 00:46:32.509]  The tip of the spear is Bandai-Military.

[00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:04.670]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.296 --> 00:47:17.979]  You talk about mind control.
[00:47:17.979 --> 00:47:19.641]  You talk about propaganda.
[00:47:19.641 --> 00:47:29.631]  I remember seven, eight years ago in Germany and France, when Islamists would run over sometimes hundreds of people with cars, killing 80 plus in one event in France, if you remember.
[00:47:29.631 --> 00:47:31.133]  And the media would say, truck attack.
[00:47:32.179 --> 00:47:34.381]  And we make jokes about it, but it's not funny.
[00:47:34.381 --> 00:47:42.567]  Now in America, CNN, MSNBC, I've got the articles right here, are calling it a car accident, a truck attack, an SUV attack.
[00:47:42.567 --> 00:47:44.128]  These are the headlines.
[00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:46.090]  You've seen them.
[00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:56.438]  And now we've got Democrats saying the attack at the Christmas parade is karma for written House acquittal.
[00:47:56.438 --> 00:47:59.260]  And of course, it's a weird, crazy white woman.
[00:48:00.424 --> 00:48:13.890]  I'm not trying to put white people down, I'm just saying, this is a bunch of leftist people engaged in black magic, basically, who want power, and most of them are white, trying to get power out of making us all kill each other, and I'm sick of it.
[00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:18.272]  I'm sick of the racist-ass black people and the weirdo white people pulling their strings.
[00:48:19.383 --> 00:48:22.004]  Because they're going to get everybody killed, basically.
[00:48:22.004 --> 00:48:31.668]  This is so... And while the Chi-Coms brag, I covered this earlier, in their newspapers how they're financing Hollywood to create racial division to bring America down.
[00:48:31.668 --> 00:48:34.089]  And then we're all screwed, the whole ship goes under.
[00:48:34.089 --> 00:48:34.989]  It's unbelievable!
[00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:37.690]  It's so obvious!
[00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.831]  Paul, going back to you here.
[00:48:39.895 --> 00:48:40.875]  You've been all over this.
[00:48:40.875 --> 00:48:43.136]  I mean, you produce so many reports on this.
[00:48:43.136 --> 00:48:44.816]  You've written so many articles on it.
[00:48:44.816 --> 00:48:45.716]  There's another example.
[00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:49.197]  This guy bombed in the hospital and then the media calls him a Christian.
[00:48:49.197 --> 00:48:51.378]  I mean, this is... So they go further now.
[00:48:51.378 --> 00:48:53.598]  It's not just cover up that it's Islamics.
[00:48:53.598 --> 00:48:57.879]  They then frame Christians who statistically are the most peaceful people in the world.
[00:48:57.879 --> 00:49:01.220]  Paul Watson of Summit.News.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.901]  Yeah, this was an incident that happened last Sunday on Remembrance Day during the parade.
[00:49:06.664 --> 00:49:11.005]  Where this individual got into a taxi with a suicide bomb.
[00:49:11.005 --> 00:49:12.846]  He planned to blow himself up.
[00:49:12.846 --> 00:49:27.210]  Thankfully, the taxi driver, who should get the highest honour, the highest medal available, I don't think he has yet, he'll probably end up like the Millwall supporter during the London Bridge attacks who challenged the terrorists and was later demonised as a domestic extremist.
[00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:35.092]  In fact, let's remind people of the Lion of London Bridge, what he fought like 10 dudes who stabbed him dozens of times and still kicked their ass and saved people.
[00:49:35.652 --> 00:49:37.073]  I mean, tell people about that guy.
[00:49:37.073 --> 00:49:39.934]  We forget about the Lion of London Bridge.
[00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:46.217]  Well, yeah, they ran onto the London Bridge, started mowing people down, jumped out of the car, started stabbing people.
[00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:55.241]  This guy is challenging them, he's attacking them, and he's later put on a government watch list because he criticised Islam too much and was too vehement in his opinion.
[00:49:55.241 --> 00:49:56.882]  He was made to go take classes!
[00:49:56.882 --> 00:49:58.163]  He was made to go take classes!
[00:49:59.008 --> 00:50:01.911]  Yeah, he was being made to take re-education classes.
[00:50:01.911 --> 00:50:07.495]  The literal hero in stopping the jihadist attack was put on a government watch list.
[00:50:07.495 --> 00:50:10.178]  This case in Liverpool last Sunday.
[00:50:10.178 --> 00:50:13.120]  So he gets in a taxi with this suicide bomb.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.362]  The taxi driver knows something's up with him.
[00:50:15.362 --> 00:50:16.883]  He's fidgeting around with wires.
[00:50:16.883 --> 00:50:20.186]  There's smoke emanating from his backpack.
[00:50:20.186 --> 00:50:25.531]  The taxi driver drives him to where he wants to go, which is outside a women's hospital in Liverpool.
[00:50:25.531 --> 00:50:26.512]  Now, we don't know whether
[00:50:27.242 --> 00:50:33.806]  He planned to attack the hospital or a Remembrance Day parade that was taking place just a stone's throw away.
[00:50:33.806 --> 00:50:38.088]  By the way, the Remembrance Day parade started at a cathedral.
[00:50:38.088 --> 00:50:44.211]  So apparently this Christian convert wants to bomb a Christian cathedral because that makes perfect sense.
[00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:47.553]  So thankfully, he ends up just blowing himself up.
[00:50:47.553 --> 00:50:49.154]  No one else was seriously injured.
[00:50:49.154 --> 00:50:51.055]  The taxi driver survived.
[00:50:51.055 --> 00:50:52.536]  Then the media comes out and says,
[00:50:53.385 --> 00:50:54.946]  He was a Christian convert.
[00:50:54.946 --> 00:51:00.309]  Well, we know that they lie because his asylum claim was rejected in 2014.
[00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:08.553]  They go to the cathedral and pretend to become Christian converts, so then their asylum application is more likely to be accepted.
[00:51:08.553 --> 00:51:15.236]  The fact is, while he was constructing this bomb, he was seen attending a mosque every single day during Ramadan.
[00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:32.408]  The week before the attack, he was seen praying in this mosque with fellow Muslims, and yet this lie that he was a Christian convert, he wasn't a Christian convert, he was a fake convert, was still being repeated by the BBC days after this attempted attack happened.
[00:51:32.408 --> 00:51:37.593]  So Paul, I mean, at this level, they might as well just say Daryl Brooks was a white supremacist.
[00:51:38.774 --> 00:51:43.735]  In Wisconsin, in Waukesha, that ran over 50 black people.
[00:51:43.735 --> 00:51:46.996]  I mean, that's the level of this identity theft disinfo.
[00:51:46.996 --> 00:51:49.037]  And I'm not trying to even blame any group.
[00:51:49.037 --> 00:51:54.058]  I'm just saying, they cover up when one group does it, and then lie about Rittenhouse and say he shot three black people.
[00:51:54.058 --> 00:51:54.898]  Not true.
[00:51:54.898 --> 00:51:55.738]  It's just next level.
[00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:59.339]  This is brainwashing that's so insane, but they never get in trouble for it.
[00:51:59.339 --> 00:52:01.540]  There is the white supremacist that ran over 50 black people.
[00:52:02.782 --> 00:52:17.926]  No, their reaction today, the Daily Beast in particular, is they're now going after Tim Pool and Andy Ngo, saying that they're bad for posting screenshots of this guy's Facebook account, where he's like, yes, let's go out and violently attack white people.
[00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:19.627]  This guy ran over another white person.
[00:52:19.627 --> 00:52:20.787]  I'm glad you raised that point.
[00:52:20.787 --> 00:52:23.488]  They're now claiming that they're internet trolls who made it up.
[00:52:23.488 --> 00:52:25.929]  No, that's really his Facebook and Twitter.
[00:52:25.929 --> 00:52:27.589]  That's really his Instagram.
[00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:29.170]  That's really who he is.
[00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:30.070]  But they can't handle it.
[00:52:31.331 --> 00:52:44.410]  And again, if the tables were turned, if a white guy was posting Confederate flags, hatred of BLM and calling for people to go out and violently attack black people, that would be a pretty big part of the story on CNN, wouldn't it?
[00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:46.473]  But it's not, it's brushed under the carpet.
[00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:47.775]  This Liverpool attacker,
[00:52:48.641 --> 00:52:50.923]  He entered the UK in 2014.
[00:52:50.923 --> 00:52:53.966]  His asylum claim was rejected in 2015.
[00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:59.991]  He was still in the country six years later, despite his asylum claim being rejected.
[00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.152]  No one knows who he was.
[00:53:01.152 --> 00:53:02.173]  He came from Iraq.
[00:53:02.173 --> 00:53:05.036]  Whether he was radicalized, he obviously was radicalized.
[00:53:05.036 --> 00:53:07.338]  So he remained in the country for six years.
[00:53:07.338 --> 00:53:08.379]  Imam al-Swilmeen.
[00:53:08.379 --> 00:53:11.161]  And they say he was a devout Muslim.
[00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:13.343]  You've got links to this in your article at Summit.News.
[00:53:13.343 --> 00:53:14.885]  He was at mosque repeatedly every week.
[00:53:16.049 --> 00:53:16.849]  Yeah.
[00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:19.451]  And, again, he's another refugee.
[00:53:19.451 --> 00:53:25.373]  How many times do we have to have refugees turn into terrorists before we have proper border controls, Alex?
[00:53:25.373 --> 00:53:32.777]  The Manchester Arena bomber who blew himself up killed a bunch of kids at the Ariana Grande concert in 2017.
[00:53:32.777 --> 00:53:40.881]  A refugee from Libya, literally rescued by the Royal Navy, by the UK government, brought into the country.
[00:53:40.881 --> 00:53:43.702]  That's how he repays us, by blowing up a bunch of kids.
[00:53:44.366 --> 00:53:54.632]  You had the Paris massacre terrorists exploited the refugee wave, pretended to be Syrian, that's how they got into Europe, that's how they killed dozens of people.
[00:53:54.632 --> 00:54:03.217]  Oh, I love how they always call 25-30 year old men children too, and in Germany and France even put them in middle schools with little kids they then rape.
[00:54:03.217 --> 00:54:06.379]  And this is all a sick leftist joke.
[00:54:06.379 --> 00:54:07.360]  Yeah, they literally have
[00:54:08.753 --> 00:54:13.458]  45-year-old men coming in on buses to the UK and say they're children.
[00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:21.225]  They did tests of their teeth, even in Sweden, and found that they were 40, 50 years old, but we were called racist for pointing out that they're not children.
[00:54:21.874 --> 00:54:26.597]  And you had it with the beheading of the schoolteacher in France, Samuel Paty.
[00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:32.041]  Again, a refugee brought in by the government ends up killing somebody in France.
[00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:36.084]  You had the beheading in Nice, same story, a Chechen refugee.
[00:54:36.084 --> 00:54:47.132]  There have been innumerable mass casualty terror attacks carried out across Europe by people either pretending to be refugees, getting into the country on the carpet of the refugee wave,
[00:54:47.938 --> 00:54:54.245]  And you have a situation in the UK, Alex, where we've had over 20,000 boat migrants come in.
[00:54:54.245 --> 00:55:01.933]  This year alone, turns out the government has only deported out of 20,000 just this year, five of them.
[00:55:01.933 --> 00:55:03.355]  And you've seen the videos.
[00:55:03.355 --> 00:55:06.859]  They got off the boats, whether it's in the UK, in Spain, wherever,
[00:55:07.259 --> 00:55:09.981]  I live, I live backed up to woods and houses and apartments and
[00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:26.186]  My son wants us to be armed now when we hike down there, because there's almost no one around.
[00:55:26.186 --> 00:55:30.288]  There are Haitians living and running around the woods behind my house.
[00:55:30.288 --> 00:55:32.409]  And this is in West Austin, which is a nice area.
[00:55:32.409 --> 00:55:35.091]  This is all over the damn world now, all over the Western world.
[00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:36.191]  And it's only just begun.
[00:55:36.191 --> 00:55:37.352]  How crazy is this going to get?
[00:55:37.352 --> 00:55:38.553]  I know you live in London.
[00:55:38.553 --> 00:55:39.893]  You're planning to move out soon.
[00:55:39.893 --> 00:55:42.055]  You were telling me off air, it's like uninhabitable now.
[00:55:42.055 --> 00:55:42.715]  You can't even go out.
[00:55:44.784 --> 00:55:50.928]  It's getting worse and this government promised to reduce immigration to drastically lower levels.
[00:55:50.928 --> 00:55:52.189]  It's completely failed to do so.
[00:55:52.189 --> 00:56:04.737]  The only good thing that's come out of this is that now Nigel Farage is saying he's going to get back into politics and he is the only real opposition in this country because we have a fake Labour Party opposition which wants even more open borders.
[00:56:04.737 --> 00:56:07.078]  So that's the only good thing that's come out of it.
[00:56:07.078 --> 00:56:10.801]  But then again you had the media reaction after the attempted Liverpool suicide bombing.
[00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:15.127]  Within 48 hours, Sky News, one of the top broadcasters in the UK,
[00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:30.715]  48 hours after a jihadist tried to blow up a hospital, their top headline on their website was about some Pakistani cricket players being called mean words by other cricket players 15 years ago.
[00:56:30.715 --> 00:56:43.899]  And that was seen as a more important controversy, someone being called a mean word 15 years ago, than a literal suicide bomber trying to blow up a hospital or trying to blow up a World War II, World War I memorial.
[00:56:44.159 --> 00:56:46.562]  Just a stone's throw away from where his bomb went off.
[00:56:46.562 --> 00:56:57.517]  So again, it's about letting them into the country and then it's about the media cover-up that happens in the immediate aftermath and that's precisely what you've seen again with this SUV attack, this black supremacist
[00:56:57.992 --> 00:57:00.153]  In Wisconsin, and it's only going to continue.
[00:57:00.153 --> 00:57:14.217]  Exactly, which is all an exercise by the intelligence agencies and the ruling class over the media to see if they can successfully cover up vaccine damages, vaccine deaths, secret operations, crimes committed by the invaders.
[00:57:14.217 --> 00:57:15.657]  All of it is a plan.
[00:57:15.657 --> 00:57:23.780]  Paul, do five more minutes with us ahead of Roger Stone joining us with exclusive information on the subpoenas he and I received for the January 6th kangaroo court coming up.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:32.244]  Please don't forget, listeners, we've only got a week or so left on free shipping and double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:32.244 --> 00:57:37.926]  And Turbo Force, 10 hours of clean energy, is finally back in stock, 40% off.
[00:57:37.926 --> 00:57:47.091]  And we've got the new super whitening coral calcium toothpaste, better than even the last brand we had, made in America, back in stock, discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:47.992 --> 00:57:48.773]  Info Wars!
[00:58:05.464 --> 00:58:07.747]  Again, so many toxins out.
[00:58:07.747 --> 00:58:19.843]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at InfoWarsTour.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[00:58:19.843 --> 00:58:22.827]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:32.484]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:32.484 --> 00:58:35.945]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:38.806]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[00:58:38.806 --> 00:58:48.371]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[00:58:51.542 --> 00:58:56.526]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[00:58:56.526 --> 00:59:03.452]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[00:59:03.452 --> 00:59:09.456]  Then our God Satan will reward us with eternal life.
[00:59:09.456 --> 00:59:12.319]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[00:59:14.036 --> 00:59:15.358]  They must first play God.
[00:59:15.358 --> 00:59:21.829]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:23.231]  And in a way, they're right.
[00:59:23.231 --> 00:59:26.376]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us...
[00:59:27.285 --> 00:59:29.247]  Destroy our children's futures.
[00:59:29.247 --> 00:59:30.929]  The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[00:59:30.929 --> 00:59:34.633]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[00:59:34.633 --> 00:59:35.514]  So I ask you now.
[00:59:35.514 --> 00:59:41.159]  Are you going to step up and expose the dual war even more?
[00:59:41.159 --> 00:59:44.783]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[00:59:44.783 --> 00:59:47.666]  The front lines of the fight is InfoWars.com
[00:59:52.552 --> 00:59:56.459]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.082]  The year is 2021.
[01:00:16.082 --> 01:00:19.784]  The date is Tuesday, November 23rd.
[01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:22.426]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:22.426 --> 01:00:23.846]  Honored to be here.
[01:00:23.846 --> 01:00:25.407]  Paul Watson, big picture.
[01:00:25.407 --> 01:00:29.830]  Obviously, we've got the WikiLeaks, we've got the documents, we've got Klaus Schwab's public statements.
[01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:35.113]  The powerful elites of the world are devaluing currencies to use them to buy up all the infrastructure.
[01:00:35.113 --> 01:00:40.897]  Their rearguard action is social conflict, divide and conquer, that so many empires have used for control.
[01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:48.840]  But it doesn't seem like it's going well for them, so it seems like we're going into a very dangerous, insane time.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.424]  What would you call this time we're living in, and what do you expect them to do in the next 11 months ahead of the midterms?
[01:00:54.424 --> 01:01:00.268]  Because they know they're about to be repudiated, and the globalists are about to lose control of their main command base.
[01:01:00.268 --> 01:01:01.509]  How do you think they're going to strike back?
[01:01:03.607 --> 01:01:21.177]  I think they're going to intensify the complete demonization of the unvaccinated Alex to the point where you had the Australian minister the other day, and you probably played the clip already yesterday, where he's literally saying with like raging bug eyes, which is the common denominator which all these people have.
[01:01:22.105 --> 01:01:29.627]  Quote, if you give a green light, give comfort to, support anybody who argues against the vaccine, you're an anti-vaxxer.
[01:01:29.627 --> 01:01:35.288]  That's the kind of rhetoric that George W. Bush said when he said you're either with us or with the terrorists.
[01:01:35.288 --> 01:01:41.409]  The next stage is to literally dehumanise, demonise the unvaccinated as terrorists.
[01:01:41.409 --> 01:01:43.389]  And that's precisely what's happening.
[01:01:43.389 --> 01:01:46.530]  The left pretends to care about oppressed minorities.
[01:01:47.338 --> 01:01:52.419]  The preeminent oppressed minority today is the unvaccinated.
[01:01:52.419 --> 01:01:54.460]  They're dehumanised by the media.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.480]  That's the guy I was talking about right there.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.802]  They're dehumanised by the media and violently persecuted by the state.
[01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:06.323]  We're told this lie that we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated, Alex.
[01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:13.645]  The numbers you look out of the UK today, you look at the numbers of people in hospital, Covid hospitalisations in the UK.
[01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:19.584]  67% of Covid hospitalisations in the UK are vaccinated people.
[01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:23.067]  It's even higher when you look at adults.
[01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:26.950]  71% of Covid hospitalisations are vaccinated.
[01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:30.093]  So it's not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:02:30.093 --> 01:02:35.798]  It's a complete lie and yet they continue to claim that because they need to dehumanise
[01:02:36.178 --> 01:02:45.209]  Denigrate the unvaccinated so that they can release the wrath of the state in terms of violent persecution against the unvaccinated.
[01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:48.333]  Use them as the scapegoat and abuse them.
[01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:52.217]  Use them as the example, as a warning to intimidate other people.
[01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:54.260]  But again, as you said, it's not really working.
[01:02:55.037 --> 01:03:07.572]  Because even in places like Poland, like Denmark, you have large numbers of the population that remain unvaccinated despite this massive tyranny and these threats against them.
[01:03:07.572 --> 01:03:12.657]  And Paul, I want to ask you what comes next in the two minutes we have left and do an hour later in the week or next week, please with us.
[01:03:12.657 --> 01:03:13.699]  I respect your view on this.
[01:03:13.699 --> 01:03:14.540]  You're dead on target.
[01:03:15.703 --> 01:03:22.146]  You've got German government putting out numbers in the UK government that people are twice as likely to die if they've had the shot.
[01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.207]  They say they don't know why.
[01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:26.669]  And then now you're more likely to get sick if you've had the vaccine.
[01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:29.030]  I mean, even Fauci's having to admit that now.
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.631]  So how the hell are they going to get away with this?
[01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:35.313]  This just seems like they've shot themselves in the foot here.
[01:03:35.313 --> 01:03:42.497]  In the UK, they're actually trying to lobby the government to not release the statistics because they're being cited by the unvaxxed extremists.
[01:03:42.981 --> 01:03:45.623]  For example, Alex, this is reported today.
[01:03:45.623 --> 01:03:52.810]  From official government data, the rates of COVID infection per 100,000 are now higher among the VACs than the un-VACs.
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:56.553]  We have Gibraltar cancelling official Christmas events.
[01:03:56.553 --> 01:03:59.216]  Their entire adult population is vaccinated.
[01:03:59.216 --> 01:04:00.817]  They've got a COVID spike.
[01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:05.462]  Ireland, 94% adult population vaccinated.
[01:04:05.462 --> 01:04:06.803]  They've got a COVID spike.
[01:04:07.163 --> 01:04:18.028]  So the entire case for this, the entire case for vaccine passports, which by the way are now banning people who can prove they don't have the virus, they're removing that option entirely.
[01:04:18.028 --> 01:04:33.836]  Their entire case for it has been demolished and the only way they can intensify it and step it up is by increasing the intimidation, increasing the threats, as we've seen in Austria, by now literally threatening to put people in prison for four years if they don't take the vaccine and that's the way it's going.
[01:04:34.195 --> 01:04:38.779]  Paul, you do the best job breaking it down over at Summit.News and also at InfoWars, but you're absolutely right.
[01:04:38.779 --> 01:04:43.604]  And now Germany is saying, oh, we may just force-inoculate everybody, not just lock you in your house.
[01:04:43.604 --> 01:04:44.885]  I mean, this is here.
[01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:46.487]  Tyranny's not coming, it's here.
[01:04:46.487 --> 01:04:48.969]  Watson, thank you so much, and have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:54.555]  I know you don't really celebrate in the UK, but I'm going to be here eating bugs like Bill Gates said, OK?
[01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:55.356]  OK, thanks, Alex.
[01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:55.616]  Thank you.
[01:04:58.393 --> 01:05:07.340]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:13.265]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[01:05:13.265 --> 01:05:14.686]  Horrible crashes and
[01:05:16.235 --> 01:05:18.518]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[01:05:18.518 --> 01:05:30.614]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at InfoWarsTour.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[01:05:30.614 --> 01:05:33.598]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[01:05:34.588 --> 01:05:43.270]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:46.711]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[01:05:46.711 --> 01:05:49.592]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[01:05:49.592 --> 01:05:59.134]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:09.437]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are in resistance.
[01:06:09.437 --> 01:06:17.824]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:24.990]  You say that you wanna go to the
[01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:43.461]  How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today?
[01:06:43.461 --> 01:06:48.843]  You talk lots about God.
[01:06:48.843 --> 01:06:54.666]  Freedom comes from the car, but that's not why.
[01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:31.062]  Yeah.
[01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:35.666]  McCarthyism on steroids.
[01:08:35.666 --> 01:08:38.148]  The year 2021.
[01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:48.315]  Every major populist nationalist leader has been subpoenaed or indicted or even convicted and then pardoned by President Trump.
[01:08:48.315 --> 01:08:50.136]  We have the global exclusive.
[01:08:50.136 --> 01:08:55.940]  Roger Stone, longtime political confidant of the 45th president, and of course we know the real winner.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.961]  That evidence is overwhelming now.
[01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:06.796]  Joining us to discuss the subpoena by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6th attack, which again is the
[01:09:08.746 --> 01:09:12.610]  Progeny of Joseph McCarthy and has gone even further.
[01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:20.157]  McCarthy didn't put hundreds of people in solitary confinement for 9, 10, 11 months without even being able to have a trial.
[01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:21.398]  This is incredible.
[01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:27.123]  So, Roger Stone is here to give us his exclusive take on being subpoenaed along with myself.
[01:09:27.123 --> 01:09:32.408]  The top story of the United States, hell, in Japan and Germany, it was all over the world yesterday, wasn't
[01:09:33.633 --> 01:09:40.717]  A radical black supremacist who said on Twitter and Instagram he was going to attack whites or only cowards were standing down.
[01:09:40.717 --> 01:09:43.719]  Whites need to be attacked is the Rittenhouse verdict.
[01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:48.382]  No, no, it wasn't 40-something people run over, five of them killed, little kids run over.
[01:09:48.382 --> 01:09:49.022]  It wasn't that.
[01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:57.127]  It was Roger Stone and Alex Jones are evil and the January 6th committee is on their tail.
[01:09:57.127 --> 01:09:58.208]  And now we've gotten the subpoena.
[01:09:59.082 --> 01:10:05.326]  All these questions about who have we talked to, what have we done, did we ever talk to a three percenter, did we ever... We want every document under the sun!
[01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:08.088]  And of course, if you don't comply right, you go to jail!
[01:10:08.088 --> 01:10:09.089]  Unless you plead the fifth.
[01:10:09.089 --> 01:10:16.334]  And then Mark Randazza, my Chief Legal Counsel on all the flotilla of the Democratic Party, civil suits, is riding shotgun with us for the hour.
[01:10:16.334 --> 01:10:24.779]  But let's first go to Roger Stone exclusively to give us his first video statement on where he stands and what's really going on.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.823]  I'm actually proud to be here with you being targets of these people because we're pro-America.
[01:10:29.823 --> 01:10:31.625]  We're not in trouble because we're bad.
[01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:35.128]  We're in trouble because we won't back down to evil and we stand for freedom.
[01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:35.388]  Roger?
[01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:38.580]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:52.109]  This is my first national statement on any medium right here at InfoWars, just as in the hours after I was framed and charged in the Mueller witch hunt.
[01:10:52.109 --> 01:10:57.593]  It was InfoWars where I did my very first interview to lay out the truth of that epic struggle.
[01:10:57.593 --> 01:11:02.276]  And now, Alex, whether you like it or not, you're connected to me at the hip for the rest of your life.
[01:11:02.276 --> 01:11:05.258]  We're kind of like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:10.061]  Uh, and here's the thing, neither one of us did anything wrong.
[01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:12.701]  Uh, this is a politically motivated witch hunt.
[01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:15.622]  Let's call it Witch Hunt 2.0.
[01:11:15.622 --> 01:11:25.266]  I've been disparaged and smeared as the promoter of an attack on the American Capitol on January 6th, despite the fact that I wasn't there.
[01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:33.085]  Any assertion, claim, or implication to the contrary is categorically false.
[01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:39.429]  There is no evidence or any witness who can honestly come forward and say otherwise.
[01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:40.730]  Dustin Stockton?
[01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:42.351]  I don't know who that is.
[01:11:42.351 --> 01:11:43.612]  Jennifer Lawrence?
[01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:44.772]  Don't know them.
[01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:46.733]  Taylor Budovich?
[01:11:46.733 --> 01:11:48.294]  Don't know who that is.
[01:11:48.294 --> 01:11:50.616]  So this is this is the same
[01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:58.758]  Ongoing effort we've seen previously, where you criminalize constitutionally protected political activity.
[01:11:58.758 --> 01:12:04.080]  You know, the reason I love America is because I love free speech in the Constitution.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:14.385]  And the Constitution guarantees us the right to freely assemble, to petition our government, and to speak freely on the issues of the day.
[01:12:14.385 --> 01:12:17.487]  Any activity that I engaged in on January 5th,
[01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:23.237]  Or six, for that matter, was constitutionally protected free speech.
[01:12:23.237 --> 01:12:27.102]  I know nothing about unlawful activities at the Capitol.
[01:12:27.102 --> 01:12:27.923]  Period.
[01:12:27.923 --> 01:12:29.344]  Full stop.
[01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:31.186]  There is nothing to turn over.
[01:12:31.186 --> 01:12:33.649]  There is nothing to testify against.
[01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:34.811]  It's a witch hunt.
[01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:46.825]  And let me finally add, the chairman of the committee has filed a civil suit against Donald Trump and therefore has proven that he is not an unbiased or honest arbiter.
[01:12:46.825 --> 01:12:49.486]  This gives McCarthy a bad name.
[01:12:49.486 --> 01:12:53.808]  McCarthy was a good guy comparing to these smear artists.
[01:12:53.808 --> 01:13:01.671]  I totally agree, Roger, and we need to focus on that again, that the head of the committee has sued Trump
[01:13:02.935 --> 01:13:07.018]  And is going after him on a host of issues, including January 6th.
[01:13:07.018 --> 01:13:12.563]  How can he then be the judge over this whole political fiasco?
[01:13:12.563 --> 01:13:13.764]  But let me ask you the big question.
[01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:19.549]  Obviously, I'm not nailing you down here, but I intend to currently go with the fifth.
[01:13:19.549 --> 01:13:28.856]  Not that I have anything to hide, but I saw how they set you up in the whole Russiagate fraud and hoax, and how I was here when you were trying to get us on, Johnny.
[01:13:28.856 --> 01:13:30.738]  When you gave us the time of day, we were all bummed out about it.
[01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:33.559]  And they said, oh, you were secretly running Assange and all this.
[01:13:33.559 --> 01:13:35.239]  I knew it was a lie, because I was there.
[01:13:35.239 --> 01:13:37.760]  I saw them convict you in a kangaroo court.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.301]  So that got my attention.
[01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:40.741]  I thought it was a joke back when it was happening.
[01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:41.941]  I said, don't worry, Roger.
[01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:42.782]  You've done nothing wrong.
[01:13:42.782 --> 01:13:43.502]  No, you were right.
[01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:44.742]  You said it was serious.
[01:13:44.742 --> 01:13:47.983]  And so I don't want to be Roger Stone right now in this.
[01:13:47.983 --> 01:13:52.045]  And that's why our forebears fought the British crown and defeated them for the Fifth Amendment.
[01:13:52.045 --> 01:13:55.126]  And I think that's where I'm going here, because these guys have no honor.
[01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:57.687]  No matter what I give them or what I say, they're going to say it's a lie.
[01:13:57.687 --> 01:13:58.847]  So why not just Fifth Amendment?
[01:13:59.991 --> 01:14:01.132]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:07.135]  Look, we know the House Democrats reclassified information with impunity.
[01:14:07.135 --> 01:14:13.098]  They illegally, in my case, consorted with the special prosecutor.
[01:14:13.098 --> 01:14:15.659]  There's no integrity in this process.
[01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:18.001]  It's not an honest, unbiased conduct.
[01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:20.022]  It's not that I've done anything wrong.
[01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:29.407]  I'm not going to decide what I'm going to do today because there is a drop-dead date on the subpoena of December 17th, I believe, other than to say
[01:14:30.143 --> 01:14:35.807]  We have a member of the House Intelligence Committee who was sleeping with a Chinese spy.
[01:14:35.807 --> 01:14:40.770]  Now, he has access to national security secrets as a member of the committee.
[01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:50.297]  His office was penetrated by an employee who was working for that Russian spy, but they want to investigate Donald Trump and Roger Stone.
[01:14:50.297 --> 01:14:51.698]  This is an absurdity.
[01:14:51.698 --> 01:14:53.840]  We have become clickbait.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.941]  I mean, that's really what this is about.
[01:14:55.941 --> 01:14:57.442]  I have nothing to do with this.
[01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:58.603]  I know nothing about it.
[01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:02.811]  I'm many things, Alex, but I'm not stupid.
[01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:13.998]  Whoever would think that trespassing at the Capitol or menacing lawmakers, even though nobody was armed, would benefit Donald Trump politically is either an idiot or an amateur.
[01:15:13.998 --> 01:15:14.579]  Exactly.
[01:15:14.579 --> 01:15:16.600]  Why would we blow our feet off?
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.622]  It's a nice way of saying, why would we put our dicks in a garbage disposal?
[01:15:20.622 --> 01:15:24.305]  It's so ridiculous that we'd have a motive for this.
[01:15:24.305 --> 01:15:27.547]  Well, in my place, it would take a very large garbage disposal.
[01:15:30.388 --> 01:15:34.349]  With me it would take a pencil sharpener.
[01:15:34.349 --> 01:15:35.789]  I'm not going there.
[01:15:35.789 --> 01:15:37.750]  It's actually gigantic, alright.
[01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.870]  That's going to be the headline.
[01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:43.371]  Hold on.
[01:15:43.371 --> 01:15:45.071]  That's all satire, folks.
[01:15:45.071 --> 01:15:46.472]  That's going to be the headline.
[01:15:46.472 --> 01:15:53.313]  We'll be right back with Mark Randazzo, my chief legal counsel, here with us with Roger Stone.
[01:15:53.313 --> 01:15:55.954]  You gotta go to the jokes there, you know, Dick Cheney stuff.

[01:17:00.134 --> 01:17:05.659]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[01:17:05.659 --> 01:17:11.926]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:17.591]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:23.177]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save InfoWars.
[01:17:23.877 --> 01:17:31.264]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[01:17:31.264 --> 01:17:35.588]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:36.809]  We don't think so.
[01:17:36.809 --> 01:17:41.373]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[01:17:41.373 --> 01:17:42.254]  But we won't let them.
[01:17:42.894 --> 01:17:47.035]  Alex Jones will have his day in court with your support.

[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.821]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate
[01:18:07.952 --> 01:18:15.537]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:28.967]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.

[01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:07.687]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[01:19:07.687 --> 01:19:09.208]  It's all come out.
[01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:15.971]  And they're doing that, not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:19.213]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:24.976]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:32.684]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:44.913]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[01:19:45.453 --> 01:19:49.374]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[01:19:49.374 --> 01:19:55.076]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is shaytanic.
[01:19:55.076 --> 01:20:01.838]  And we are opposing the One World Government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:04.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.842 --> 01:20:33.687]  So, the former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, disgraced.
[01:20:33.687 --> 01:20:37.110]  We have the video, we'll play it next segment.
[01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:39.452]  I watched it this morning and I forgot about it.
[01:20:39.452 --> 01:20:41.474]  And then I'm telling Roger, hey, what do you want to cover next?
[01:20:41.474 --> 01:20:51.203]  He goes, I want to talk about Andrew McCabe saying that Roger Stone is at the center, along with Alex Jones, of this whole giant plan to attack the Capitol.
[01:20:51.203 --> 01:20:53.345]  Now, this is an even bigger hoax than the Russia game.
[01:20:54.005 --> 01:20:55.467]  And so I'd forgotten about that.
[01:20:55.467 --> 01:20:59.333]  That's a pretty big deal to have this guy out there claiming this fraud again.
[01:20:59.333 --> 01:21:04.822]  Not that we're Russian agents, but we're at the center of the plan to attack the Capitol.
[01:21:04.822 --> 01:21:07.246]  So they're really telling us where they're going, Roger.
[01:21:08.642 --> 01:21:11.684]  Yeah, this is laughable bullshit, is what it is.
[01:21:11.684 --> 01:21:14.186]  I mean, let's be very clear.
[01:21:14.186 --> 01:21:16.207]  I wasn't on the Ellipse.
[01:21:16.207 --> 01:21:17.948]  I didn't march to the Capitol.
[01:21:17.948 --> 01:21:19.750]  I wasn't at the Capitol.
[01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:30.897]  I never left the grounds of my hotel on January 6th, and I know nothing about any illegal activities on the Capitol, anywhere around the Capitol, or in Washington, D.C., that day.
[01:21:30.897 --> 01:21:31.818]  Period.
[01:21:31.818 --> 01:21:36.221]  Andrew McCabe, however, is at the White House Center of the Russian collusion hoax.
[01:21:36.861 --> 01:21:56.206]  And in fact, on the day that I was convicted in a kangaroo style court, you know, a Soviet show trial in Washington, D.C., the prosecutor in my case announced that Andrew McCabe would not be prosecuted for lying to the FBI about the Russian collusion hoax.
[01:21:56.206 --> 01:21:57.606]  This is bizarro world.
[01:21:57.606 --> 01:21:59.467]  The world is upside down.
[01:22:00.047 --> 01:22:01.268]  What's the point?
[01:22:01.268 --> 01:22:03.589]  Alex, it's just more lawfare.
[01:22:03.589 --> 01:22:07.912]  Grind you down with legal fees, drag your name through the mud.
[01:22:07.912 --> 01:22:13.376]  Although, I've got to admit, a lot of these pictures of you and I together look pretty damn cool.
[01:22:13.376 --> 01:22:16.918]  Well, yeah, they're saying, like, next thing we've got to do is kill Batman, like we're villains.
[01:22:16.918 --> 01:22:19.860]  No, we're like Batman fighting the villains.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.101]  Roger, we've got Mark Rondazzo.
[01:22:21.101 --> 01:22:22.601]  He's got a lot of points and questions to ask.
[01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:23.882]  He's read the subpoena.
[01:22:23.882 --> 01:22:25.103]  He says it's beyond McCarthy.
[01:22:25.103 --> 01:22:26.044]  I want to get his take on that.
[01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:41.247]  Isn't this about distracting from the inflation, the record gas prices, the Federal Reserve saying, eat tofu, not turkey, that's a real headline, and the imploding borders, and just all the crazy corruption of the Democratic Party?
[01:22:42.796 --> 01:22:43.717]  Well, that's part of it.
[01:22:43.717 --> 01:22:55.045]  But the other part of it, frankly, is just the bloodlust against me because I was pardoned and the bloodlust against you because you supported me in my epic fight for freedom.
[01:22:55.045 --> 01:23:02.291]  So these guys hate us because, as Plato said, no one is as hated as the truth teller.
[01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:04.292]  They'd like to shut Infowars down.
[01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:07.835]  They'd like to just close you down so you can stop broadcasting the truth.
[01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:12.982]  This is epically debilitating, as you know, financially.
[01:23:12.982 --> 01:23:27.572]  All of these civil suits, and I still face six more baseless, unsubstantiated, groundless, but tremendously sensationalized civil suits, and now I have to defend myself legally in this proceeding.
[01:23:27.572 --> 01:23:35.837]  And we're going to talk about that before you leave, but we are seen as like, go back to the Roman standards, like the standard of a legion.
[01:23:35.837 --> 01:23:37.999]  If they can capture that, that'll demoralize us.
[01:23:38.439 --> 01:23:40.339]  And I'm not trying to brag, but it's true.
[01:23:40.339 --> 01:23:45.220]  The left sees Donald Trump as the big standard, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, other big standards.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.260]  They're really trying to seize us.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.521]  Mark Randazza, you said you got into legal stuff reading about McCarthy.
[01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:51.021]  Now you're here.
[01:23:51.021 --> 01:23:56.242]  Yeah, you know, I'm an old school liberal and I haven't burst into flames as I've been here.
[01:23:56.242 --> 01:24:00.803]  And what that means is I believe in freedom of expression for everybody.
[01:24:00.803 --> 01:24:04.904]  In fact, especially for people I disagree with, not just for people I agree with.
[01:24:05.584 --> 01:24:22.021]  And, you know, when I started studying McCarthyism when I was in journalism school back at UMass, I remember looking at that and thinking, boy, you know, why weren't more people courageous enough to stand up and say, I hate communism, but I hate the deprivation of civil liberties more?
[01:24:22.722 --> 01:24:25.883]  And I thought, boy, you know, it's a shame I wasn't alive back then.
[01:24:25.883 --> 01:24:31.946]  Well, I tell you, I shouldn't have wished that I would have the ability to be in a fight like that, because here I am.
[01:24:31.946 --> 01:24:42.251]  You know, right now, I think that this is the closest thing to, and in fact, it improves upon, if you can use that word, it improves upon how McCarthy did things.
[01:24:42.671 --> 01:24:45.753]  We have the same exact thing going on.
[01:24:45.753 --> 01:24:48.874]  We have the press marshaled against people.
[01:24:48.874 --> 01:24:50.795]  We have the government marshaled against people.
[01:24:50.795 --> 01:24:51.316]  And why?
[01:24:51.316 --> 01:24:54.798]  Because you have the audacity to be political dissidents.
[01:24:54.798 --> 01:25:05.283]  Now the only thing different between the populist right right now and the communists back then is at least the populist right here has a lot of public support.
[01:25:05.283 --> 01:25:10.286]  The communists at the time had, if anything, a tiny sliver of support because we knew better.
[01:25:10.686 --> 01:25:11.886]  We knew better as a country.
[01:25:11.886 --> 01:25:16.328]  We knew that that was going to lead us to Stalinism or lead us to Maoism.
[01:25:16.328 --> 01:25:25.111]  You know, but here, you actually had a populist movement that grew up in alternative media when you had the mainstream corporate press.
[01:25:25.111 --> 01:25:32.113]  I tell you, I used to say it acts like Pravda for the left, but I think that's actually an inapt comparison.
[01:25:32.113 --> 01:25:38.175]  It's probably more of an obscure comparison to Radio Mille Collines in Rwanda before the genocide.
[01:25:38.755 --> 01:25:51.969]  I mean, I see the way that these people talk about you, talk about Roger, talk about anybody who might agree with you, and it is a concerted effort to dehumanize you and to drag you down so that we have no dissent in this country.
[01:25:51.969 --> 01:25:55.573]  And damn it, competition is what built America.
[01:25:55.573 --> 01:25:59.317]  Competition in the capital systems, competition in industry.
[01:25:59.657 --> 01:26:05.600]  Competition in creativity, competition in everything, including the marketplace of ideas.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.282]  That is why we have a First Amendment.
[01:26:08.282 --> 01:26:16.086]  And when you want to go in there and shut down one of the carts in the marketplace of ideas, you're no longer acting in good faith as an American.
[01:26:16.086 --> 01:26:18.348]  And shame on this committee for how it's acting.
[01:26:18.948 --> 01:26:19.929]  Well, amen to that.
[01:26:19.929 --> 01:26:22.791]  And it's because multinational corporations are taking over.
[01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:24.593]  Where do we go next, Roger?
[01:26:24.593 --> 01:26:32.660]  Because when we talk about the Fifth Amendment, not that we've done anything wrong, but why should we have to pay a bunch of lawyers that dig through everything and then just have them say we lie?
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:34.882]  The only answer is, hey, Fifth Amendment, I think.
[01:26:36.802 --> 01:26:39.284]  Look, I haven't decided what I'm going to do about this subpoena.
[01:26:39.284 --> 01:26:39.985]  I won't decide.
[01:26:39.985 --> 01:26:42.727]  It has a return date, I believe, of December 17th.
[01:26:42.727 --> 01:26:44.529]  I'll decide between now and then.
[01:26:44.529 --> 01:26:47.111]  But this is an effort at distraction.
[01:26:47.111 --> 01:26:52.055]  Congressman Adam Schiff told us that he had seen substantial evidence of Russian collusion.
[01:26:52.055 --> 01:26:53.676]  He's never produced a thing.
[01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:59.381]  Eric Swalwell's office was penetrated by a Chinese communist spy he was sleeping with.
[01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:10.849]  Jerry Nadler goes crazy about non-existent DOJ interference in my case, but now he wants the DOJ to interfere in the verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse case.
[01:27:10.849 --> 01:27:16.713]  These people are hypocrites, and this is an effort to distract from their own lies and their own crimes.
[01:27:18.336 --> 01:27:19.096]  You're absolutely right.
[01:27:19.096 --> 01:27:23.918]  In fact, next segment for TV viewers, radio listeners can imagine, and they're lucky they don't have to look at it.
[01:27:23.918 --> 01:27:29.721]  I mean, you look at the Penguin, Adler, and you look at Pelosi, and you look at Swallow's Well.
[01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:31.742]  They're a legion of morons.
[01:27:31.742 --> 01:27:37.564]  These are ridiculous people perched on top of America's back that have sold us out to China.
[01:27:37.564 --> 01:27:40.025]  They should be very easy to get rid of politically.
[01:27:41.727 --> 01:27:47.149]  Well, look, the real question is in 2022, will we have a fair, honest, transparent election?
[01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:49.730]  If we do, these people are toast.
[01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:53.471]  I mean, gas prices are heading to $8 a gallon before it's over.
[01:27:53.471 --> 01:28:01.875]  You're going to see far, far more deaths and injuries from the COVID-19 vaccination as they attempt to make it mandatory, compulsory.
[01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:07.977]  You have us being pushed around, around the world by the Chinese, by the North Koreans again.
[01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:11.362]  The Russians are masked on the borders of Crimea.
[01:28:11.362 --> 01:28:11.743]  Why?
[01:28:11.743 --> 01:28:18.313]  Because Joe Biden exudes weakness, and our adversaries can see that.
[01:28:18.313 --> 01:28:19.656]  You were around, Alex.
[01:28:19.656 --> 01:28:22.821]  Do you remember any food shortages under President Donald J. Trump?
[01:28:23.642 --> 01:28:26.423]  Did we have high gas prices under Donald J. Trump?
[01:28:26.423 --> 01:28:26.483]  No.
[01:28:26.483 --> 01:28:30.005]  Were we having to beg gasoline from the Russians and the Saudis?
[01:28:30.005 --> 01:28:30.605]  No.
[01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:40.030]  So they want to distract from the horrific conditions in America under this incompetent and probably illegitimately elected president.
[01:28:41.064 --> 01:28:42.345]  I totally agree with you.
[01:28:42.345 --> 01:28:51.489]  This is a ruling class, out of control, collapsing, rotting, dying, and they're projecting their own death fears onto us, trying to bring America with us into their death spiral.
[01:28:51.489 --> 01:28:54.991]  We're sorry they're all physically dying, but they all will be dead soon.
[01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:55.491]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.389 --> 01:28:58.410]  ATTENTION RADIO LISTENERS!

[01:31:03.628 --> 01:31:09.114]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.

[01:31:21.466 --> 01:31:24.269]  They supply the border patrol, everybody, with their systems as well.

[01:31:32.535 --> 01:31:34.717]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[01:31:34.717 --> 01:31:35.177]  These aren't.
[01:31:35.177 --> 01:31:37.159]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[01:31:37.159 --> 01:31:38.820]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[01:31:40.601 --> 01:31:42.222]  A hundred and fifteen minutes.

[01:31:43.102 --> 01:31:44.263]  Works like a regular cell phone.
[01:31:44.263 --> 01:31:45.563]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[01:31:45.563 --> 01:31:46.864]  And I keep one in my car.
[01:31:46.864 --> 01:31:48.705]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[01:31:48.705 --> 01:31:51.106]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[01:31:51.106 --> 01:31:52.866]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:31:52.866 --> 01:31:53.907]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[01:31:59.887 --> 01:32:04.730]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:06.792]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:32:06.792 --> 01:32:12.275]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:32:12.275 --> 01:32:13.376]  But we failed.
[01:32:13.376 --> 01:32:14.557]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:32:15.017 --> 01:32:22.900]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational de-industrialization Great Reset.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:31.822]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:32:31.822 --> 01:32:37.024]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:32:37.024 --> 01:32:39.925]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storable food.
[01:32:39.925 --> 01:32:42.746]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[01:32:43.126 --> 01:32:44.787]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:10.253 --> 01:33:31.441]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:35.903]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:33:35.903 --> 01:33:38.104]  Roger Stone riding shotgun with this global exclusive.
[01:33:39.699 --> 01:33:46.985]  And Mark Randazza is a top First Amendment lawyer and more, but during the little short break, I said, why do you think they're doing this?
[01:33:46.985 --> 01:33:52.069]  He just did this two-minute rant to me that was absolutely on target and amazing.
[01:33:52.069 --> 01:33:59.455]  Can you repeat, I know it's hard to repeat, genius again on cue, but repeat what you just said during the break.
[01:33:59.455 --> 01:34:04.679]  In 2008, I actually donated to and volunteered on the Obama campaign.
[01:34:05.467 --> 01:34:11.180]  And we laughed at the fact that the Republicans didn't really understand the internet at that point.
[01:34:12.017 --> 01:34:16.358]  And, you know, we just looked at the Internet as digital Massachusetts.
[01:34:16.358 --> 01:34:21.679]  There was no point in putting much effort into it because the Republicans weren't even going to show up.
[01:34:21.679 --> 01:34:27.181]  Well, in 2016, in those intervening eight years, a lot of people on the right learned how to use the Internet.
[01:34:27.181 --> 01:34:33.122]  And then all of a sudden, this alternative media is what came into play.
[01:34:33.122 --> 01:34:36.163]  People who weren't in the mainstream corporate press.
[01:34:36.163 --> 01:34:41.084]  That mainstream corporate press has acted hand-in-hand with the Democratic Party for decades.
[01:34:41.664 --> 01:34:56.478]  So, you know, Democrats watched their own news feed, their own Pravda, and all that got regurgitated back to them was, what a joke the Trump campaign was, what a joke people like you were, what a joke all it was, and they didn't, they just weren't prepared for it.
[01:34:56.478 --> 01:35:01.744]  They were as shocked as anybody was the next morning when they woke up and they saw that Trump had won.
[01:35:02.344 --> 01:35:06.187]  And I think they looked at that and they swore they'd never be caught like that again.
[01:35:06.187 --> 01:35:12.272]  Now what a real American would do at that point is say, how did we lose in the marketplace of ideas?
[01:35:12.272 --> 01:35:14.214]  How do we retool our arguments?
[01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:20.820]  How do we get to connect with the American people, these people who are patriotic, who believe in America, who believe in the Constitution?
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:31.586]  But instead, they looked to the other direction, and they decided that they were going to try to win the marketplace of ideas by shutting down the opposing store in that marketplace.
[01:35:31.586 --> 01:35:33.927]  They went the classic purge authoritarian model.
[01:35:33.927 --> 01:35:41.511]  Yeah, just come out, shut down opposing media, and you notice that first they started with people that it was easy to start with.
[01:35:41.511 --> 01:35:50.576]  You know, they tested the waters with Milo, and then they kept moving along, and they kept hitting other people, and as one by one... Well, just say it, they demonized me particularly so that
[01:35:50.916 --> 01:35:52.296]  And Roger Stone and I got banned.
[01:35:52.296 --> 01:35:53.556]  People wouldn't stand for us.
[01:35:53.556 --> 01:35:54.757]  And then every domino fell.
[01:35:54.757 --> 01:35:56.177]  So we'll talk about the way to counter that.
[01:35:56.177 --> 01:35:56.717]  One by one.
[01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:58.877]  I want to get your take on how we counter that in a moment.
[01:35:58.877 --> 01:36:02.158]  But Roger, responding to what Randazza just said, you're right.
[01:36:02.158 --> 01:36:03.878]  What you said is so important before break.
[01:36:03.878 --> 01:36:05.299]  I cannot stress this enough.
[01:36:05.299 --> 01:36:08.579]  This is all a distraction from the Ghislaine Maxwell pedophile trial.
[01:36:08.579 --> 01:36:10.660]  This is all a distraction from the open borders.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:18.241]  This is all a distraction from the dollar devaluation and Biden dumping the strategic oil reserve on the market and oil prices didn't really go down.
[01:36:19.481 --> 01:36:28.724]  So speak to that, and where do they go when they're crashing and burning, and national polls have 67% of people, even in fake polls, hating him.
[01:36:28.724 --> 01:36:30.385]  It's probably 80%.
[01:36:30.385 --> 01:36:34.426]  I've never seen such a cratering here as a long-term political hand.
[01:36:34.426 --> 01:36:36.847]  What do you read the tea leaves?
[01:36:36.847 --> 01:36:42.088]  Well, first of all, let me say I have the highest possible regard for Mark Grandazzo.
[01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:44.129]  He's a man of integrity and he's a great lawyer.
[01:36:44.993 --> 01:36:57.402]  In fact, if you read M. Staten's book, Blacklisted by History, which Ann Coulter called the second greatest book after the Bible, it makes a pretty good case that there was communist subversion in America in the 1950s.
[01:36:57.402 --> 01:37:08.530]  Now, it's McCarthy's tactics we don't like, and in this case, these are the tactics of McCarthy, the tactics of smear, the tactics of vilification, and that's exactly the point.
[01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:09.991]  We have become clickbait.
[01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:14.833]  We're being attacked because it just makes the left drool.
[01:37:14.833 --> 01:37:37.519]  The reason my wife was attacked outside our home last Christmas by some left-wing lunatic, the reason that there's so much hatred, I mean literally a tsunami of hate on Twitter against me, against Alex Jones, against Owen Schroer, is because we are cutting through the BS to tell people the truth.
[01:37:38.039 --> 01:37:43.623]  There is a disproportionate amount of red Chinese influence in our government today.
[01:37:43.623 --> 01:37:55.632]  We have an authoritarian and politicized Department of Justice in which the FBI breaks into the home of journalists like James O'Keefe to try to determine who their sources are.
[01:37:55.632 --> 01:38:00.736]  This is to have a chilling effect on every other journalist in America.
[01:38:01.266 --> 01:38:09.095]  You know, those guys at the New York Times and the Washington Post who may be chortling, you better be very careful because they may be next.
[01:38:09.095 --> 01:38:11.618]  Freedom of the press is out the window.
[01:38:11.618 --> 01:38:17.425]  In fact, their answer to being challenged on any intellectual basis is censorship.
[01:38:18.417 --> 01:38:20.079]  Is de-platforming.
[01:38:20.079 --> 01:38:22.581]  Is in fact outright cancellation.
[01:38:22.581 --> 01:38:25.905]  And then is trying to put you in prison like they're doing to you and I over and over again.
[01:38:25.905 --> 01:38:27.706]  I mean, let's not forget you got pardoned.
[01:38:27.706 --> 01:38:29.248]  And again, I like Roger.
[01:38:29.248 --> 01:38:31.590]  Roger's a really smart, funny guy to hang out with.
[01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:32.271]  Great insights.
[01:38:32.271 --> 01:38:34.112]  Always very careful about being accurate.
[01:38:34.112 --> 01:38:36.054]  People always say he's this big villain liar.
[01:38:36.054 --> 01:38:38.597]  I remember saying, you want a job at M4's.
[01:38:38.597 --> 01:38:41.640]  I'm not trying to act tough like, oh, he wanted a job, but he did obviously want to get paid.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:42.561]  You know, he's a capitalist.
[01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:48.243]  And I'm like, listen, I love you as a show, I love you as a guest, but I want Julian Assange and I want this and that.
[01:38:48.243 --> 01:38:53.506]  And then if you can get big guests for the show, I will pay you the nice sum he wanted.
[01:38:53.506 --> 01:38:54.526]  And he goes, I'll get on it.
[01:38:54.526 --> 01:38:57.407]  I'm talking to this Randy Credico and they tell me it's big.
[01:38:57.407 --> 01:39:00.769]  So I already knew that Roger told the truth to Congress.
[01:39:00.769 --> 01:39:03.510]  I knew he didn't have a contact with Assange.
[01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:04.450]  I was there.
[01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:07.832]  And then I watched him convict him of something he didn't do.
[01:39:08.612 --> 01:39:10.074]  Because I was laughing at Roger before.
[01:39:10.074 --> 01:39:11.997]  I thought it was a... I mean, he used to get mad at me.
[01:39:11.997 --> 01:39:14.100]  He said, listen, Siri, you need to watch out.
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:14.801]  And he was right.
[01:39:14.801 --> 01:39:20.170]  So now I listen to Roger, but that's why I take this very serious this time, even though we're totally innocent.
[01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:21.492]  Because these people are crazy.
[01:39:22.864 --> 01:39:39.180]  Well, look, on November 3rd, 2020, only because BuzzFeed brought a lawsuit, Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice were forced to release the last remaining long-hidden redactions in their secret report, in which they admitted that there was, quote, no factual evidence.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:47.944]  Tying me to Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration, or the phishing and publication of John Podesta's highly embarrassing emails.
[01:39:47.944 --> 01:39:49.825]  So what then was my motive to lie?
[01:39:49.825 --> 01:39:51.606]  What was I lying about?
[01:39:51.606 --> 01:39:59.050]  Any misstatement I made before Congress was irrelevant, immaterial, hid no underlying crime.
[01:39:59.050 --> 01:40:03.893]  Now we see Dr. Anthony Fauci lies his ass off before Congress.
[01:40:03.893 --> 01:40:07.054]  Rand Paul does a spectacular job of nailing him.
[01:40:07.054 --> 01:40:08.475]  But when will he be charged?
[01:40:08.895 --> 01:40:17.527]  When will 29 FBI agents storm his home at 6 o'clock in the morning and march his wife out of the house in her nightgown?
[01:40:21.602 --> 01:40:26.106]  Why do intelligent people with high IQs, and I'm not bragging, but we're obviously not low IQ here.
[01:40:26.106 --> 01:40:27.167]  I think we're all above 100.
[01:40:27.167 --> 01:40:29.129]  I think it's fair to say.
[01:40:29.129 --> 01:40:30.410]  Why do we get chivalry?
[01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:31.631]  Like, let's not break rules.
[01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:32.632]  Let's have agreed upon.
[01:40:32.632 --> 01:40:34.314]  Let's not do dirty things.
[01:40:34.314 --> 01:40:37.877]  Not because we're just wimps, but because we know it'll be done to our family.
[01:40:37.877 --> 01:40:42.862]  Why are they breaking all the rules, doing all this, not knowing it's going to summon their own destruction?
[01:40:42.862 --> 01:40:46.065]  I just think they don't think a few moves ahead, Roger.
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.616]  Well, except I think you have to recognize the single greatest trait they have is arrogance.
[01:40:52.616 --> 01:40:54.642]  They're extraordinarily arrogant.
[01:40:55.436 --> 01:40:59.058]  Uh, and that permeated the Mueller investigation.
[01:40:59.058 --> 01:41:02.699]  It permeated, uh, the special counsel's office.
[01:41:02.699 --> 01:41:06.361]  It permeates today, the Biden Justice Department.
[01:41:06.361 --> 01:41:08.142]  They are the law.
[01:41:08.142 --> 01:41:10.623]  Uh, and that means that they cut corners.
[01:41:10.623 --> 01:41:12.544]  Look, I'm being sued by the Biden Department of Justice.
[01:41:12.544 --> 01:41:14.524]  I mean, look at these guys in the video talking about us.
[01:41:14.524 --> 01:41:17.986]  I mean, they look like, look at the arrogance of both, all of them.
[01:41:17.986 --> 01:41:19.707]  I mean, look at these people.
[01:41:19.707 --> 01:41:21.427]  You wouldn't have these people over for dinner.
[01:41:21.427 --> 01:41:22.148]  They all look like...
[01:41:22.768 --> 01:41:24.689]  They look like supervillains!
[01:41:24.689 --> 01:41:27.230]  They're radiating evil!
[01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:29.511]  Well, you can always tell when they're lying, you see?
[01:41:29.511 --> 01:41:31.452]  Their lips are moving.
[01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:37.654]  I know that's McCabe right there, I know the bimbo in the middle, but who is the guy that looks like Dr. Evil over here?
[01:41:37.654 --> 01:41:39.855]  I don't know, he looks brain dead to me.
[01:41:39.855 --> 01:41:41.596]  He looks like an arrogant son of a bitch to me.
[01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.379]  Yeah, no, he attacked me a couple weeks ago.
[01:41:44.379 --> 01:41:45.761]  I can't even remember his name.
[01:41:45.761 --> 01:41:50.287]  But right now, I don't want to boost his name ID and give him more followers.
[01:41:50.287 --> 01:41:52.650]  You know, this is this whole thing is an absurdity.
[01:41:53.257 --> 01:41:54.798]  So, yesterday I thought about it.
[01:41:54.798 --> 01:41:55.419]  You know what?
[01:41:55.419 --> 01:41:59.442]  The House, January 6th Committee, been there, done that.
[01:41:59.442 --> 01:42:01.003]  I've got the t-shirt.
[01:42:01.003 --> 01:42:03.565]  It says, Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[01:42:03.565 --> 01:42:07.588]  Alex, the greatest single problem here, as you know, is the enormous expense.
[01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:10.450]  Look what you're going through in the Sandy Hook case.
[01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:12.692]  Look what I'm going through fighting this.
[01:42:12.692 --> 01:42:13.773]  My coffers are empty.
[01:42:13.773 --> 01:42:15.854]  My legal defense fund is bare.
[01:42:15.854 --> 01:42:16.415]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:42:16.415 --> 01:42:18.857]  We're going to both do a big plug to support us, because you're right.
[01:42:18.857 --> 01:42:19.898]  I want to explain this to the listeners.
[01:42:20.538 --> 01:42:24.600]  I already sold my nice house that was an investment to fund this operation.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.800]  I love my little house.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.601]  I'm not complaining.
[01:42:26.601 --> 01:42:29.122]  I got my Dodge car, my F-150.
[01:42:29.122 --> 01:42:30.502]  I'm a happy gambler.
[01:42:30.502 --> 01:42:34.644]  I don't care about money, but money keeps us in the war.
[01:42:34.644 --> 01:42:38.246]  If you've got an army, you've got to feed them, you've got to keep them clothed, you've got to sharpen their swords.
[01:42:38.246 --> 01:42:44.108]  And so, yes, InfoWarsStore.com, buy the great products, get them, SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:42:44.108 --> 01:42:48.030]  But Roger, when we come back, we're going to do a big, fat, juicy plug for you because, yes,
[01:42:48.650 --> 01:42:58.490]  You are such a prize to them that I get, like, when they're gonna get you, I go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[01:42:58.803 --> 01:43:04.305]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[01:43:04.305 --> 01:43:10.587]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[01:43:10.587 --> 01:43:16.269]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[01:43:16.269 --> 01:43:18.770]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet.
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:22.551]  We need you to help save InfoWars.
[01:43:22.551 --> 01:43:29.933]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[01:43:29.933 --> 01:43:34.255]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[01:43:34.255 --> 01:43:35.475]  We don't think so.
[01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:40.057]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[01:43:40.057 --> 01:43:40.917]  But we won't let them.
[01:43:41.577 --> 01:43:44.279]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.
[01:43:44.279 --> 01:43:52.506]  With your support, go to SaveInfoWars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[01:43:52.506 --> 01:43:56.168]  SaveInfoWars.com and God bless America.
[01:44:02.375 --> 01:44:03.555]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:44:03.555 --> 01:44:04.356]  Granny Do-Right.
[01:44:04.356 --> 01:44:05.436]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:44:05.436 --> 01:44:05.996]  Go ahead.
[01:44:05.996 --> 01:44:06.516]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:06.516 --> 01:44:09.137]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[01:44:09.137 --> 01:44:19.860]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:25.862]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[01:44:25.862 --> 01:44:26.862]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[01:44:29.143 --> 01:44:36.865]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[01:44:36.865 --> 01:44:45.608]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[01:44:45.608 --> 01:44:46.428]  This is working.
[01:44:46.428 --> 01:44:47.428]  This is wonderful.
[01:44:47.428 --> 01:44:51.890]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:56.631]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[01:44:59.144 --> 01:45:04.105]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[01:45:04.105 --> 01:45:20.929]  When we look at the world system now, openly announcing the mark of the beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very
[01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:24.471]  Future over to them.
[01:45:24.471 --> 01:45:26.232]  They want control of procreation.
[01:45:26.232 --> 01:45:29.174]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[01:45:29.174 --> 01:45:34.938]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[01:45:34.938 --> 01:45:40.482]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[01:45:40.482 --> 01:45:50.009]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[01:45:51.024 --> 01:46:00.034]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[01:46:00.034 --> 01:46:03.438]  What are champions made of?
[01:46:03.438 --> 01:46:04.580]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:46:11.132 --> 01:46:13.073]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:13.073 --> 01:46:15.614]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:15.614 --> 01:46:17.254]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:17.254 --> 01:46:18.395]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:18.395 --> 01:46:19.955]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:19.955 --> 01:46:22.036]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:22.036 --> 01:46:24.077]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:46:37.342 --> 01:46:40.784]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best!
[01:46:40.784 --> 01:46:42.425]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest!
[01:46:42.425 --> 01:46:44.406]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline!
[01:46:44.406 --> 01:46:46.947]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 That's InfoWarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.862 --> 01:47:36.866]  You know, Rick Linklater's a nice guy, and he called me up 20-something years ago, put me in the first movie I was in, and then put me in another.
[01:47:36.866 --> 01:47:40.649]  And then I got a bunch of movie offers after that, and I had no thrill seeing myself on the big screen.
[01:47:40.649 --> 01:47:42.290]  I don't care about being on the national news.
[01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:44.352]  I don't care about meeting powerful, rich people.
[01:47:44.952 --> 01:47:54.158]  But I love being in the Zeitgeist, fighting tyranny, and knowing all of these listeners, and all these great people, and folks that stand against tyranny.
[01:47:54.158 --> 01:47:58.140]  That, to me, is exciting, and you are the real rock stars in my life.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.662]  I mean, I like, I love Ted Nugent's music.
[01:48:00.662 --> 01:48:08.987]  He's got some of the best music out there, but the fact that he's been fighting them since the 70s, and is a trailblazer, I admire him.
[01:48:08.987 --> 01:48:12.790]  It's not about the great guitar he plays, it's about
[01:48:13.945 --> 01:48:15.727]  How he stands up for what's right.
[01:48:15.727 --> 01:48:17.970]  Now let's talk about Andrew McCabe.
[01:48:17.970 --> 01:48:24.177]  He's won back full FBI pension after being fired under Trump, The Hill reports, and all his legal bills paid.
[01:48:24.177 --> 01:48:25.078]  Wow!
[01:48:25.078 --> 01:48:27.320]  I never got my legal bills paid.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.746]  The Democratic Party, the same folks that bankrupted Remington, filed six Sandy Hook suits.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.963]  We're down to four of them right now, and we got two others we're dealing with.
[01:48:37.963 --> 01:48:38.624]  Okay?
[01:48:38.624 --> 01:48:39.684]  That's the level.
[01:48:39.684 --> 01:48:42.787]  People say, well, you know, I'm like a baby bird begging for money here.
[01:48:42.787 --> 01:48:43.267]  Yeah.
[01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:44.828]  Folks, we're the tip of the spear.
[01:48:44.828 --> 01:48:51.793]  If you want us to keep fighting, if you want us to stand up, I mean, we are the champions of freedom.
[01:48:51.793 --> 01:48:54.796]  And I'm not up here like some arrogant son of a bitch going, because that's bad luck.
[01:48:54.796 --> 01:48:56.017]  Oh man, I'm your champion.
[01:48:56.017 --> 01:48:56.737]  I'm the big daddy.
[01:48:56.737 --> 01:48:57.678]  No, I'm not the big daddy.
[01:48:58.976 --> 01:49:04.901]  I'm somebody that couldn't battle their evil and wouldn't go away and understood they were evil and that had to be resisted.
[01:49:04.901 --> 01:49:06.542]  So that's why I want you to spread the word about us.
[01:49:06.542 --> 01:49:07.723]  I want you to pray for us.
[01:49:07.723 --> 01:49:09.444]  I want you to support us at Infowarshore.com.
[01:49:09.444 --> 01:49:10.825]  I want you to support Roger Stone.
[01:49:10.825 --> 01:49:13.948]  Everybody in America should be wearing a Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt.
[01:49:14.608 --> 01:49:17.050]  By the way, he's got new t-shirt designers that were always great, but I'm jealous.
[01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:22.173]  The new one he's got from Big Daddy Distributors, Big Daddy Unlimited, a big gun company in Florida.
[01:49:22.173 --> 01:49:25.716]  I want those, but we're going to talk about those in a moment because we've got to stay on air.
[01:49:25.716 --> 01:49:27.978]  You've got to show your colors loud and proud.
[01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:32.541]  Let me tell you, wearing an Infowars shirt, a Roger Stone shirt, you can't be more avant-garde.
[01:49:32.541 --> 01:49:34.102]  You can't be more Americana.
[01:49:34.102 --> 01:49:35.303]  You can't be more populist.
[01:49:35.303 --> 01:49:36.544]  You can't be more rebel.
[01:49:36.544 --> 01:49:37.805]  You can't be more outlaw.
[01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:45.330]  I mean, they called Willie Nelson and William Jennings, who I love, outlaw country because they moved to Austin instead of Nashville and sang like they wanted to.
[01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:48.812]  We're taking on the new world order, folks, and we need your support.
[01:49:48.812 --> 01:49:51.694]  But here is what Roger Stone was talking about.
[01:49:51.694 --> 01:49:58.979]  McCabe, the disgraced former deputy director that lied to Trump, lied to Congress, everything up there talking about us being his enemies.
[01:49:58.979 --> 01:50:07.184]  So the good news is if this big, powerful man is up late at night wanting to put us in prison, that shows he's not as powerful as this criminal claims.
[01:50:07.184 --> 01:50:08.205]  And yeah, I call him a criminal.
[01:50:08.405 --> 01:50:10.006]  Here it is.
[01:50:10.006 --> 01:50:14.868]  Out front now, Andrew McCabe, former Deputy Director of the FBI, and Ellie Honig, who was an Assistant U.S.
[01:50:14.868 --> 01:50:17.449]  Attorney for the Southern District here in New York.
[01:50:17.449 --> 01:50:23.912]  Director McCabe, both Alex Jones and Roger Stone, of course, were in Washington on the day of the insurrection, the day before.
[01:50:23.912 --> 01:50:29.715]  They were both incredibly vocal proponents of pushing the big lie about the election, rigged hoax, all of that.
[01:50:29.715 --> 01:50:35.978]  They have longstanding ties to Steve Bannon, who was the one who convinced Trump to come back to Washington for January 6th.
[01:50:37.919 --> 01:50:40.460]  How central to this could they be?
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:46.704]  Well, Erin, I think they could be right at the red-hot center of it.
[01:50:46.704 --> 01:50:56.148]  And I think we've, you know, the committee has kind of telegraphed what they're thinking with each round of subpoenas that we see coming out.
[01:50:56.148 --> 01:51:02.031]  And for my money, what seems clear is they are focused intently not on
[01:51:03.252 --> 01:51:10.676]  Specifically the mayhem of the insurrection on January 6th, but on the days leading up to January 6th.
[01:51:10.676 --> 01:51:24.064]  They are trying to get to who was at the center of planning this activity, how was it funded, where were those communication networks, who was involved, who was talking to who, and how does this potentially get back to the White House?
[01:51:24.224 --> 01:51:29.127]  And of course the ultimate question, was the violence part of the plan?
[01:51:29.127 --> 01:51:36.231]  And I think these subpoenas are a great way of closing down the loop on those questions and really getting to the center of it.
[01:51:48.488 --> 01:51:53.054]  Actually, Andrew McCabe is the white hot center of the Russian collusion hoax.
[01:51:53.054 --> 01:52:00.223]  He's the one who knows the Steele dossier is a fraud, but allows it to be used the rationale for an illegal investigation.
[01:52:00.223 --> 01:52:03.688]  Then she says, I'm a close association associate of Steve Bannon's.
[01:52:04.562 --> 01:52:05.943]  What planet does she live on?
[01:52:05.943 --> 01:52:10.464]  Steve testified against me at my trial, falsely perjured himself to help Robert's mother.
[01:52:10.464 --> 01:52:13.266]  Yeah, I've asked you, even though I know he did that, to just drop it.
[01:52:13.266 --> 01:52:16.067]  You attack him like a piranha on the show.
[01:52:16.067 --> 01:52:16.867]  They all know that.
[01:52:16.867 --> 01:52:19.628]  I mean, your feud is famous.
[01:52:19.628 --> 01:52:21.769]  Well, it's not some minor political scuffle.
[01:52:21.769 --> 01:52:24.990]  They were trying to give me seven to nine, and he was trying to help them.
[01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:27.771]  So you can see how I might be somewhat upset about that.
[01:52:27.771 --> 01:52:29.292]  That's not the point here today.
[01:52:29.292 --> 01:52:31.173]  The point is she's a damn liar and knows it.
[01:52:32.185 --> 01:52:34.306]  Well, that is exactly true.
[01:52:34.306 --> 01:52:38.547]  There's one other guy here that has to be mentioned, and that is Owen Schroyer.
[01:52:38.547 --> 01:52:41.748]  You can go to GiveSendGo.com right now.
[01:52:41.748 --> 01:52:46.669]  We're only $2,000 short of raising a quarter of a million dollars for his legal defense.
[01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:48.910]  He's done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:52.511]  From what I can see, and I've read his indictment, it's a fraud.
[01:52:52.511 --> 01:53:01.554]  Owen Schroyer deserves your support, because he too is a truth teller, and he too is being smeared and disparaged and vilified when he did nothing illegal.
[01:53:02.074 --> 01:53:05.956]  Absolutely, and InfoWars will continue to... the listeners support and we appreciate that.
[01:53:05.956 --> 01:53:09.798]  But Roger, let's talk about you because your wife's got stage 4 cancer.
[01:53:09.798 --> 01:53:11.299]  Boy, she gets better.
[01:53:11.299 --> 01:53:14.380]  They beat her up outside at your apartment where you live.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:16.441]  They celebrate they took your house away.
[01:53:16.441 --> 01:53:18.242]  And you're that standard they're trying to seize.
[01:53:18.242 --> 01:53:20.083]  How do... I love the new t-shirt designs.
[01:53:20.083 --> 01:53:23.085]  Where do people find all these new great Roger Stone t-shirts and support what you're doing?
[01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:27.290]  Well, they can go to RogerStoneStore.com.
[01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:29.391]  RogerStoneStore.com.
[01:53:29.391 --> 01:53:32.452]  They can go to StoneColdTruth.com in the store.
[01:53:32.452 --> 01:53:37.695]  But most importantly, I need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:53:37.695 --> 01:53:41.936]  By law, those funds can only be used for my legal defense.
[01:53:41.936 --> 01:53:50.160]  I need lawyers, new lawyers, because I'm not going to roll over to the deep state and I will never plead to something that I didn't do.
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:54.483]  As you know, I was pressured to bear false witness against the President.
[01:53:54.483 --> 01:53:56.926]  I could have gotten off the hook by doing that.
[01:53:56.926 --> 01:53:57.987]  I refused.
[01:53:57.987 --> 01:54:00.389]  Because Michael Cohen, I am not.
[01:54:00.389 --> 01:54:06.574]  And by the way, they want to make examples of us and destroy us to intimidate anybody else that might stand up.
[01:54:06.574 --> 01:54:09.156]  That's why we don't just want to survive, we want to thrive.
[01:54:09.156 --> 01:54:10.798]  That's why if you want to save America...
[01:54:11.198 --> 01:54:12.279]  You should support Roger Stone.
[01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:13.701]  You should support Infowars.
[01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:15.123]  You should do it right now.
[01:54:15.123 --> 01:54:23.633]  Mark Rondazza comments on what we're seeing with Andrew McKay, the disgraced former deputy director that lied to Congress, up there trying to say that we're the hot red center of this.
[01:54:23.633 --> 01:54:25.435]  Look, I just don't see it.
[01:54:25.435 --> 01:54:27.237]  Maybe we're reds like communists, too.
[01:54:28.123 --> 01:54:39.271]  I mean, look, I've seen you guys say things that were politically incendiary, say things that are politically dissenting, and that's the point of America, dammit!
[01:54:39.271 --> 01:54:50.279]  You know, I remember, I don't know how many people have seen this movie, but there was a movie that came out during the Bush administration that was supposed to be an oblique attack on its excesses, and I think it had some excesses as well.
[01:54:50.919 --> 01:54:52.060]  Good night and good luck.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:53.381]  It was about the McCarthy era.
[01:54:53.381 --> 01:54:54.061]  Excellent movie.
[01:54:54.061 --> 01:54:55.582]  About Edward R. Murrow.
[01:54:55.582 --> 01:55:00.566]  But you know, you can watch that and that is a parable that fits any political excess.
[01:55:00.566 --> 01:55:05.970]  And if you watch that, watch that now and watch it and look at what they're doing now.
[01:55:05.970 --> 01:55:07.351]  It's way worse than McCarthy.
[01:55:07.351 --> 01:55:08.492]  You know what I don't agree with?
[01:55:08.492 --> 01:55:10.593]  I respectfully disagree with both of you.
[01:55:10.593 --> 01:55:13.215]  This is supposed to be a distraction.
[01:55:13.215 --> 01:55:14.176]  I don't think it is.
[01:55:14.176 --> 01:55:15.117]  I think it's the main event.
[01:55:15.797 --> 01:55:21.081]  I think they want a civil war, but they want it in a very elegant way.
[01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:22.882]  They want it against unarmed opponents.
[01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.883]  They want it against the indefensible.
[01:55:24.883 --> 01:55:31.348]  They want to limit the people who are willing to stand up to them to a tiny small group and then eliminate them.
[01:55:31.348 --> 01:55:34.190]  And then all the people who are sort of right in the middle or
[01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:37.592]  No, no, I agree with you that they want to scare them.
[01:55:37.592 --> 01:55:38.873]  It's a psychological act.
[01:55:38.873 --> 01:55:41.355]  In June, Biden said the new terror threat isn't Islam or anything.
[01:55:41.355 --> 01:55:45.319]  It's American citizens that protest and soccer moms.
[01:55:45.319 --> 01:55:46.600]  And so, yeah, you're right.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:46.980]  You're right.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.381]  I actually agree with you.
[01:55:48.381 --> 01:55:50.863]  They're trying to kick off a war against the American people.
[01:55:50.863 --> 01:55:55.407]  An American president saying the greatest threat is other Americans.
[01:55:55.407 --> 01:56:01.371]  If you've got other Americans that aren't in favor of the government, the government's not doing its job the right way.
[01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:02.812]  Yeah, but it's a government of the people.
[01:56:03.593 --> 01:56:04.974]  For the people!
[01:56:04.974 --> 01:56:06.876]  By the people!
[01:56:06.876 --> 01:56:14.982]  One thing I hear from a lot of people that agree with you, a lot of people come up to me and they say, hey, don't tell anybody this, but I think Alex is right.
[01:56:14.982 --> 01:56:17.384]  I'm like, why are you saying it that way?
[01:56:17.384 --> 01:56:18.305]  Say it loud.
[01:56:18.305 --> 01:56:20.827]  If you believe, if you agree with Alex, say it loud.
[01:56:21.487 --> 01:56:23.709]  If you don't agree with him, say it loud.
[01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:35.876]  Don't be cowed by, you know, I just don't want to get in any trouble, because that kind of silence is what's causing this, because at least half this country doesn't believe that this is how the country should be governed.
[01:56:35.876 --> 01:56:46.422]  You know, I think that they are acting in a way that they think that they might have the ability to make that final coup de grace, that final move, and they're acting without honor.
[01:56:46.482 --> 01:56:47.162]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[01:56:47.162 --> 01:56:48.543]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[01:56:48.543 --> 01:56:50.004]  Great points, Mark Rondizzo.
[01:56:50.004 --> 01:57:02.231]  And it's terrifying, you know, and frankly, look, I represent so many different people from so many different walks of life and so many places in that marketplace of ideas, and I don't care what they have to say.
[01:57:02.231 --> 01:57:06.414]  In fact, the more I disagree with somebody, the more I'm happy to represent them.
[01:57:07.236 --> 01:57:11.298]  And you know, I want to tell you just a tale of something happy.
[01:57:11.298 --> 01:57:12.418]  Stay there, we've got to come back.
[01:57:12.418 --> 01:57:18.081]  Fifteen more minutes with Mark Rondazza and of course the great Roger Stone, and then we've got Jake Ducey coming in here.
[01:57:18.081 --> 01:57:20.942]  I've got all the CIA mind control documents, stuff we've never covered.
[01:57:20.942 --> 01:57:30.507]  Literal, the most powerful stuff we've ever covered on freeing your mind is coming up in the last hour and 45 minutes, and it all ties into Reset Wars and ResetWars.com.
[01:57:30.507 --> 01:57:34.389]  But Roger Stone and Mark Rondazza, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country,
[01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:40.378]  Straight ahead, we're gonna put bookends on this thing, and he'll tell his happy story.
[01:57:40.378 --> 01:57:40.879]  Stay with us.
[01:57:40.879 --> 01:57:42.803]  But Roger, again, where do they donate?
[01:57:44.206 --> 01:57:46.327]  StoneDefenseFund.com.

[01:59:19.201 --> 01:59:21.442]  The tip of the spear is Ban.Billion.

[01:59:50.176 --> 01:59:56.059]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.253 --> 02:00:18.577]  So we have a corrupt, out-of-control political system that sold out American power in the last 40 years of China.
[02:00:18.577 --> 02:00:19.878]  One-sided deals.
[02:00:19.878 --> 02:00:20.979]  I'd be all about doing trade deals.
[02:00:20.979 --> 02:00:22.400]  We'd build everybody up.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:28.064]  That's not how it worked because they had an axe to grind politically wanting to de-industrialize the nation for political control.
[02:00:28.064 --> 02:00:28.704]  How do I know?
[02:00:28.704 --> 02:00:32.107]  It's in Zbigniew Brzezinski's books the bastard wrote.
[02:00:32.907 --> 02:00:35.370]  Burn in hell, you and your daughter.
[02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:38.294]  And people say, oh God, Alex is so mean.
[02:00:38.294 --> 02:00:42.841]  They literally destroyed the industrial base of the country so they could control us and put on welfare.
[02:00:42.841 --> 02:00:44.463]  I hate these people.
[02:00:44.463 --> 02:00:47.267]  I don't want to kill them and I don't want to wish any violence against them.
[02:00:47.267 --> 02:00:48.068]  I'm putting up with them.
[02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:52.932]  Mark Rondazzo, a First Amendment lawyer here with us.
[02:00:52.932 --> 02:00:54.333]  You've read the subpoena, you've gone over it.
[02:00:54.333 --> 02:00:58.375]  We'll come back to Roger in a moment, but you said you had a happy story to tell.
[02:00:58.375 --> 02:00:59.636]  I do.
[02:00:59.636 --> 02:01:06.319]  I represent, like I was saying before the break, I represent people all across the political spectrum.
[02:01:06.319 --> 02:01:13.764]  I'll have one person that hates the other one that I'm representing at the same time, and I represent a group of very conservative Christians called Church Militant.
[02:01:14.508 --> 02:01:17.549]  I also happen to represent the Satanic Temple.
[02:01:17.549 --> 02:01:21.049]  And Church Militant was trying to have a rally in Baltimore.
[02:01:21.049 --> 02:01:24.310]  But Baltimore is currently under what I call woke rule.
[02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:26.671]  And Baltimore tried to ban them from being there.
[02:01:26.671 --> 02:01:27.731]  And we fought them.
[02:01:27.731 --> 02:01:30.091]  We fought them all the way to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:01:30.091 --> 02:01:31.992]  And I am proud to say that we won.
[02:01:31.992 --> 02:01:37.733]  But when we got up to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, you know who came in to file an amicus brief on the Christian side?
[02:01:38.433 --> 02:01:40.014]  A satanic temple.
[02:01:40.014 --> 02:01:48.257]  So when you got satanists coming up saying, hey, we want to stand up for the principles of people that we hate, we disagree with them so fundamentally.
[02:01:48.257 --> 02:01:52.739]  Cheryl, I have listeners that they get mad at me because I've been honest and I'm brought up the fact that you've done that.
[02:01:52.739 --> 02:01:55.460]  If you don't support everybody's free speech, it doesn't exist.
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.741]  It's like the Second Amendment.
[02:01:56.741 --> 02:02:00.963]  I don't care whether you're a Christian or whether you are an agnostic or a devil or a spirit.
[02:02:00.963 --> 02:02:01.843]  You have a right to a gun.
[02:02:01.843 --> 02:02:02.944]  You have a right to use it on me.
[02:02:03.824 --> 02:02:04.764]  Unless I attack you.
[02:02:04.764 --> 02:02:05.685]  So I get that.
[02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:09.807]  Either you agree to free will, because God agrees with free will.
[02:02:09.807 --> 02:02:10.367]  I believe so.
[02:02:10.367 --> 02:02:14.829]  Look, when somebody asked me, you know, how can you represent these people?
[02:02:14.829 --> 02:02:17.530]  Where is the line at which you wouldn't represent them?
[02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:18.490]  Because they are a group of losers.
[02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:19.150]  I've seen them on TV.
[02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:22.051]  Let me tell you where the line is for whose speech I would stand up to.
[02:02:22.051 --> 02:02:22.952]  I don't have one.
[02:02:23.692 --> 02:02:27.537]  There is no way, because if you have one, then you don't believe in free speech.
[02:02:27.537 --> 02:02:31.482]  What you believe in is your tribe, and you just use... Good point.
[02:02:31.482 --> 02:02:34.426]  Roger Stone, where is all this going?
[02:02:34.426 --> 02:02:36.809]  Let me tell you some more of this story, what's great about it.
[02:02:36.809 --> 02:02:39.932]  Here's the star-spangled, flying sparks of it.
[02:02:40.673 --> 02:02:44.856]  They came in, they helped those Christians win the right to have their rally.
[02:02:44.856 --> 02:02:46.397]  Then they had their rally.
[02:02:46.397 --> 02:02:50.420]  And then the Satanists showed up to protest against that rally.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.801]  Some of the Christians got a little upset, and I said, hold on.
[02:02:52.801 --> 02:02:56.944]  And I explained to them, these people fought for your right to be here, too.
[02:02:56.944 --> 02:02:58.865]  They said, well, why are they protesting against us?
[02:02:58.865 --> 02:03:01.267]  And I said, because that is what America is all about.
[02:03:01.267 --> 02:03:02.268]  Sure, they were all about the freedom.
[02:03:02.268 --> 02:03:05.410]  And only most Satanists are really libertarians trying to dress up in that cool.
[02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:06.631]  And everybody was peaceful.
[02:03:06.631 --> 02:03:10.013]  Heck, even Antifa showed up to protest against it, and they did so peacefully.
[02:03:11.253 --> 02:03:13.374]  Sure, we need to rediscover those American values.
[02:03:13.374 --> 02:03:16.175]  What do you make of that amazing story, Roger Stone?
[02:03:16.175 --> 02:03:28.740]  Well, what bothers me, Alex, is, and I'm not allowed to get into the specifics of the subpoena, but essentially what they're trying to do is take constitutionally protected political activities and somehow criminalize them.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:33.321]  Yes, I did urge people to go to a rally to support President Donald Trump.
[02:03:33.321 --> 02:03:37.223]  Yes, I did question the extraordinary number of irregularities
[02:03:37.904 --> 02:03:39.406]  And that's the slippery slope.
[02:03:53.596 --> 02:03:57.037]  One day it's James O'Keefe's home that they're raiding.
[02:03:57.037 --> 02:03:58.878]  The next day, who knows?
[02:03:58.878 --> 02:04:03.119]  Anybody who's a journalist should realize the chilling effect that this has.
[02:04:03.119 --> 02:04:05.160]  They're trying to suppress truth.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:07.620]  They're trying to suppress the free press.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:09.441]  They're trying to suppress free speech.
[02:04:10.554 --> 02:04:14.838]  Everything I did January 5th proves nothing about January 6th.
[02:04:14.838 --> 02:04:19.021]  Yeah, I spoke at a rally that was actually sponsored by Women for Trump.
[02:04:19.021 --> 02:04:20.863]  Oh, that was sponsored by the 3%ers.
[02:04:20.863 --> 02:04:21.804]  You know what, Alex?
[02:04:21.804 --> 02:04:24.606]  I never heard of the 3%ers before this.
[02:04:24.606 --> 02:04:28.489]  I was about to say, they're asking me about all contacts.
[02:04:28.489 --> 02:04:31.372]  I mean, I've seen like patches that say 3%.
[02:04:31.372 --> 02:04:33.654]  I know that means like 3% fought the Revolutionary War.
[02:04:33.654 --> 02:04:34.494]  3%ers are motorcycle gangs?
[02:04:39.133 --> 02:04:39.673]  That's it.
[02:04:39.673 --> 02:04:40.354]  Are you now?
[02:04:40.354 --> 02:04:41.835]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:04:41.835 --> 02:04:43.636]  Because that's the point when you read the subpoena you brought up.
[02:04:43.636 --> 02:04:45.137]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:45.137 --> 02:04:46.418]  And look at these new headlines.
[02:04:46.418 --> 02:04:50.100]  The January 6th committee comes for Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:51.861]  They're coming for us.
[02:04:51.861 --> 02:04:52.922]  They're coming for America.
[02:04:57.054 --> 02:04:58.776]  Infowars, get prepared!
[02:05:15.089 --> 02:05:17.351]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[02:05:17.351 --> 02:05:29.461]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[02:05:29.461 --> 02:05:32.444]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[02:05:33.444 --> 02:05:42.132]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:42.132 --> 02:05:45.575]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[02:05:45.575 --> 02:05:48.458]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[02:05:48.458 --> 02:05:58.207]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare, a three...
[02:06:03.786 --> 02:06:09.748]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.748 --> 02:06:19.192]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:06:19.192 --> 02:06:20.152]  Boy, they hate that.
[02:06:20.152 --> 02:06:21.513]  They put that in the subpoenas.
[02:06:21.513 --> 02:06:23.233]  They attack it.
[02:06:23.233 --> 02:06:26.735]  Obviously, when I say you want to fight a political, cultural fight.
[02:06:27.728 --> 02:06:32.149]  Or like a football game, or two corporations, or Ford versus Ferrari.
[02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:36.110]  If I was going to say, come armed, take over the Capitol, that would have been the plan.
[02:06:36.110 --> 02:06:36.770]  We would have done it.
[02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:40.291]  We would have taken it back from the communists, but we didn't do that.
[02:06:40.291 --> 02:06:43.991]  So the globalists are trying to say we're violent and have to be shut down.
[02:06:43.991 --> 02:06:50.853]  All right, let's last ten minutes with the legendary Roger Stone and Mark Randazzo, First Amendment lawyer, prominent First Amendment lawyer.
[02:06:51.613 --> 02:06:54.195]  Closing points, the 10 minutes we have, Roger.
[02:06:54.195 --> 02:06:55.656]  What else is on your radar screen?
[02:06:55.656 --> 02:07:01.180]  I know you want to talk about Rittenhouse, this attack up with the suicide killer.
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:04.843]  I mean, he didn't commit suicide, but he killed so many people.
[02:07:04.843 --> 02:07:08.325]  What else is on your radar screen?
[02:07:08.325 --> 02:07:09.967]  You know, it's amazing now.
[02:07:09.967 --> 02:07:17.192]  So you have Black Lives Matter activists saying now they're furious because they have to worry about getting shot when they go out to kill somebody.
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.381]  This is an outrageous thing.
[02:07:20.381 --> 02:07:25.705]  What's great about the Rittenhouse verdict is it proves that the system can still work.
[02:07:25.705 --> 02:07:31.850]  That the fundamental judicial system set up by our founding fathers really can work.
[02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:32.771]  God bless him.
[02:07:32.771 --> 02:07:38.756]  But that goes to the larger point, Alex, and that is, I'm only here by the grace of God.
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:44.121]  I'm only here because I reaffirmed my commitment to Jesus Christ.
[02:07:44.121 --> 02:07:48.302]  I'm only here because I confessed that I was a sinner and I got right with Christ.
[02:07:48.302 --> 02:07:55.844]  Because they were going to frame me and hang me after gagging me in a Soviet-style show trial.
[02:07:55.844 --> 02:07:57.505]  So, God is good.
[02:07:57.505 --> 02:07:59.985]  God has the protection of this nation.
[02:07:59.985 --> 02:08:01.826]  We do know how this comes out.
[02:08:01.826 --> 02:08:02.846]  You know why?
[02:08:02.846 --> 02:08:04.526]  We read the Bible.
[02:08:04.526 --> 02:08:05.507]  That's why.
[02:08:05.507 --> 02:08:06.347]  We know that good
[02:08:07.299 --> 02:08:08.780]  Triumphs in the end.
[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:09.640]  That's why.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:11.701]  We just don't know how it happens.
[02:08:11.701 --> 02:08:13.542]  You want to make God laugh?
[02:08:13.542 --> 02:08:15.363]  Tell him you have a plan.
[02:08:15.363 --> 02:08:15.883]  No.
[02:08:15.883 --> 02:08:18.284]  He has a plan for this nation.
[02:08:18.284 --> 02:08:20.245]  It's on our money.
[02:08:20.245 --> 02:08:21.905]  In God we trust.
[02:08:21.905 --> 02:08:24.567]  Of course they want to take that off too.
[02:08:24.567 --> 02:08:29.069]  Oh yeah, General Flynn said, I don't care what religion you are, you gotta believe in God.
[02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:31.029]  We need to believe in God to save the country.
[02:08:31.029 --> 02:08:33.390]  And they spun it and said, we want a state-run religion.
[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:34.211]  He didn't say that!
[02:08:35.484 --> 02:08:38.768]  No, General Flynn is one of the greatest men of this century.
[02:08:38.768 --> 02:08:40.530]  He's a man of destiny.
[02:08:40.530 --> 02:08:42.452]  He's a man of the Constitution.
[02:08:42.452 --> 02:08:43.873]  He's a man of Bible.
[02:08:43.873 --> 02:08:49.579]  Then I pick up the media and they say, oh no, he belongs to a satanic cult.
[02:08:49.579 --> 02:08:50.841]  He's a Roman Catholic.
[02:08:51.201 --> 02:08:53.403]  By the way, he's also pro-life.
[02:08:53.403 --> 02:08:58.646]  There's an ABC story that they keep recycling constantly where he says it's decided law.
[02:08:58.646 --> 02:09:00.007]  Well, guess what, folks?
[02:09:00.007 --> 02:09:02.629]  As of today, it is decided law.
[02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:04.430]  Doesn't mean we like it that way.
[02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:06.432]  Doesn't mean we aren't going to work to change that.
[02:09:06.432 --> 02:09:07.832]  They manipulate and lie about everything.
[02:09:07.832 --> 02:09:08.853]  Randazzo, you had a point to make.
[02:09:10.694 --> 02:09:25.259]  The reason that they are against that, the reason they are against him expressing that, and the reason I think it's great for you to have strong families, and even, you know, I'm not a very religious person, but I think it is a great thing when people are, because you should always have
[02:09:26.019 --> 02:09:27.480]  Another loyalty.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.442]  What they want is you to have your only loyalty be to the state.
[02:09:31.442 --> 02:09:40.648]  Dissolve your loyalty to your church, dissolve your loyalty to your family, and eliminate that so that all you are is a subject of a state.
[02:09:40.648 --> 02:09:51.375]  And then, if they can erode the resistance in some other, you know, in the opposition party, and then what they wind up is a one-party state where you have but one loyalty.
[02:09:51.835 --> 02:09:55.518]  That was the whole point of Marx's, the religion is the opiate of the people.
[02:09:55.518 --> 02:09:59.181]  Yeah, sure, it distracts people from bad things, but isn't that a good thing?
[02:09:59.181 --> 02:10:04.645]  Isn't it good that you have faith in something larger than your government, larger than your community?
[02:10:04.645 --> 02:10:05.186]  Well, that's it.
[02:10:05.186 --> 02:10:06.867]  It makes the states not the top thing.
[02:10:06.867 --> 02:10:08.929]  You reach out, you have larger ideas.
[02:10:08.929 --> 02:10:14.874]  And then psychologically, it shows people that pray and believe in God have to live longer, get over illnesses.
[02:10:14.874 --> 02:10:16.895]  I mean, it's reaching out to the infinite.
[02:10:16.895 --> 02:10:18.697]  I mean, look, I don't care what you believe in.
[02:10:18.697 --> 02:10:21.279]  I would fight for your right to believe in anything.
[02:10:21.539 --> 02:10:28.961]  But it should have something you can believe in, or even if you want to give that up voluntarily, give that up voluntarily.
[02:10:28.961 --> 02:10:31.041]  But you know, you have a right to that.
[02:10:31.041 --> 02:10:31.561]  Absolutely.
[02:10:31.561 --> 02:10:35.822]  I had a question when it came out and nobody answered, and I forget what it was.
[02:10:35.822 --> 02:10:37.983]  Roger, what do you expect the authoritarians to do next?
[02:10:37.983 --> 02:10:39.363]  Because they're trying to intimidate everybody.
[02:10:39.363 --> 02:10:42.804]  They're trying to raid and ensue and indict.
[02:10:43.564 --> 02:10:47.609]  You know, charge and just go after everybody that's a prominent American.
[02:10:47.609 --> 02:10:50.492]  I see this wearing thin, but they don't seem to want to stop.
[02:10:50.492 --> 02:10:51.373]  They're in their own bubbles.
[02:10:51.373 --> 02:10:53.135]  What do they do next?
[02:10:53.135 --> 02:10:55.157]  I think they're trying to engender violence.
[02:10:55.157 --> 02:10:57.159]  You see, we're opposed to violence.
[02:10:57.159 --> 02:10:59.582]  We believe in the democratic system.
[02:10:59.582 --> 02:11:01.664]  For 40 years I've worked in elections.
[02:11:01.664 --> 02:11:02.846]  That's how we bring change.
[02:11:03.399 --> 02:11:17.132]  But if our elections are not fair, free and transparent, if no judicial body or legislative body or regulatory body will examine the elections, it's like a pressure cooker.
[02:11:17.132 --> 02:11:19.654]  They would like us to fire the first shot.
[02:11:19.654 --> 02:11:24.239]  They'd like us to throw the first punch, but we're not going to do that because that's what they want.
[02:11:24.819 --> 02:11:30.442]  They used the January 6th routine, which I frankly think is a false flag operation.
[02:11:30.442 --> 02:11:35.885]  There's an enormous amount of evidence that this was engendered by the FBI.
[02:11:35.885 --> 02:11:42.428]  Even the New York Times admits that there were FBI informants riddled throughout the protesters.
[02:11:42.888 --> 02:11:48.272]  Whoever thought it was a good idea to trespass and amend its lawmakers doesn't understand American politics.
[02:12:05.123 --> 02:12:11.908]  But if it was a real congressional committee with fair Republicans and Democrats on each side, I would come because I want a real investigation.
[02:12:11.908 --> 02:12:13.729]  Trump asked for National Guard, didn't do it.
[02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:16.611]  They sent away half the Capitol Police that day to do traffic control.
[02:12:16.611 --> 02:12:17.612]  They ended up standing down.
[02:12:17.612 --> 02:12:18.793]  They waved people in.
[02:12:18.793 --> 02:12:22.956]  I want to know all that because clearly they were trying to set us up that day.
[02:12:22.956 --> 02:12:24.957]  I want an investigation of the Secret Service.
[02:12:24.957 --> 02:12:27.960]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but about who wanted me to be at the front.
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.281]  I'm not stupid now.
[02:12:29.281 --> 02:12:31.822]  In hindsight, they were trying to set us up, as you've said.
[02:12:31.822 --> 02:12:33.924]  I want a new January 6th investigation.
[02:12:34.385 --> 02:12:35.890]  That's bipartisan and real.
[02:12:35.890 --> 02:12:37.034]  Does Roger Stone call for that?
[02:12:38.044 --> 02:12:39.105]  I totally agree with that.
[02:12:39.105 --> 02:12:45.129]  Alex, I was right after the president spoke, as I have said previously, in my hotel room at the Willard.
[02:12:45.129 --> 02:12:49.332]  And by the way, if there was a war room of some type at the Willard, I don't know about it.
[02:12:49.332 --> 02:12:50.472]  I wasn't in it.
[02:12:50.472 --> 02:12:53.715]  I was certainly not with Steve Bannon or with Mayor Giuliani.
[02:12:53.715 --> 02:12:55.676]  I know nothing whatsoever about it.
[02:12:55.676 --> 02:12:59.278]  But just because I was staying in that hotel, you get lumped in.
[02:12:59.278 --> 02:13:03.281]  This is the ABC News technique of guilt by association.
[02:13:03.281 --> 02:13:07.544]  Oh, here's a picture of Roger Stone with one of the Proud Boys out in front of his hotel.
[02:13:08.044 --> 02:13:09.345]  Yeah, so what?
[02:13:09.345 --> 02:13:10.206]  What does that prove?
[02:13:10.206 --> 02:13:16.370]  Well, that's pure McCartneyism again to say, well, there was one communist at the bank of 100 employees, so you must be.
[02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:31.662]  Look, I've never joined, and I'm not a big joiner, but you know, just seeing them try to target you, saying, well, are you now, or have you ever been a member of, I want to join whatever that sentence is, I don't care what it is, because Roger was absolutely right.
[02:13:32.182 --> 02:13:43.869]  Earlier he said, I was inspired by what he said, he said he had a right to do this, a right to say what he wanted to say about the election, a right to organize, a right to assemble, and that is what's under attack.
[02:13:43.869 --> 02:13:44.890]  And you know what?
[02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:54.576]  When you use that analogy, you talk about being under attack, I want both of you to realize something, and that is the saying that, you know, you always get the most flack when you're directly over the target.
[02:13:54.576 --> 02:13:56.698]  You two are over the target right now, gentlemen.
[02:13:57.625 --> 02:14:02.507]  Well, you said it, and we can't get into the depositions and things, but hey, we're going to win these Sandy Hook cases.
[02:14:02.507 --> 02:14:04.068]  And I said they're going to default, that's why.
[02:14:04.068 --> 02:14:08.229]  And that's why they can't give us a real jury trial, because what they're saying isn't true.
[02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:14.432]  Look, I'm not going to comment on any of your existing cases except to say that I have faith things are going to work out.
[02:14:14.432 --> 02:14:15.192]  I really do.
[02:14:15.192 --> 02:14:16.713]  And it looks dark, but you know what?
[02:14:16.713 --> 02:14:18.673]  You've been up my ass looking at everything.
[02:14:18.673 --> 02:14:21.655]  Is most of what they say true?
[02:14:21.655 --> 02:14:24.556]  Alex, you are the most lied about person in America.
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:26.700]  I will say that.
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:28.501]  Roger might be the silver medalist.
[02:14:28.501 --> 02:14:29.921]  You guys are competing for that.
[02:14:29.921 --> 02:14:38.163]  But, you know, I just know about you and I know that anytime I'm talking to anybody who doesn't know you, it is lies.
[02:14:38.163 --> 02:14:42.284]  And, you know, I just, things that they say that you say, you didn't say.
[02:14:42.284 --> 02:14:44.564]  When they say, well, you're just reading from biased news.
[02:14:44.564 --> 02:14:45.784]  Well, what about you?
[02:14:45.784 --> 02:14:46.845]  You know, I hear people.
[02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.325]  There's no pre-planning.
[02:14:48.325 --> 02:14:50.125]  We're just, you're covering our opinion.
[02:14:50.125 --> 02:14:52.006]  This is the most chaotic thing I've ever, you know.
[02:14:52.006 --> 02:14:53.106]  It's like we're at a barbershop.
[02:14:53.306 --> 02:15:00.889]  I come on set here and I'm like, I have had more planned conversations take place around a campfire with a bunch of people drinking beers and smashing bottles.
[02:15:00.889 --> 02:15:11.792]  So, no, this is... Hey, Roger, one more time, how do folks support a real warrior, a real Trojan, a real 300 to fight against tyranny?
[02:15:11.792 --> 02:15:19.695]  Look, I need help at stonedefensefund.com to fight these subpoenas, to fight the various harassment
[02:15:20.447 --> 02:15:22.788]  Baseless, meritless lawsuits against us.
[02:15:22.788 --> 02:15:24.608]  The coffers are bare, folks.
[02:15:24.608 --> 02:15:25.669]  I'll never quit.
[02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:28.069]  I will always fight, but I can't do it without your help.
[02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.450]  Exactly.
[02:15:28.450 --> 02:15:34.952]  You'll never give up, but you could give out like an old horse, and me too, because we're both old horses in this fight, and it's made us stronger.
[02:15:34.952 --> 02:15:36.672]  But folks, we need support.
[02:15:36.672 --> 02:15:37.653]  We're your champions.
[02:15:37.653 --> 02:15:40.534]  Infowarsstore.com, SaveInfowars.com.
[02:15:40.534 --> 02:15:41.654]  And one more time, Roger, where?
[02:15:42.677 --> 02:15:44.897]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:15:44.897 --> 02:15:47.478]  God bless you, Alex, and thanks for your support.
[02:15:47.478 --> 02:15:48.698]  And God bless America.
[02:15:48.698 --> 02:15:49.258]  Exactly.
[02:15:49.258 --> 02:15:50.278]  And so much is happening.
[02:15:50.278 --> 02:15:50.698]  Join us.
[02:15:50.698 --> 02:15:51.219]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:15:51.219 --> 02:15:52.419]  I'll give you one thing, too.
[02:15:52.419 --> 02:15:53.799]  You know, a lot of people... We're out of time.
[02:15:53.799 --> 02:15:54.479]  We're out of time.
[02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:55.419]  Come back tomorrow.
[02:15:55.419 --> 02:15:56.099]  Come back tomorrow.
[02:15:56.099 --> 02:16:03.501]  If you're concerned about the power grid... Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[02:16:03.501 --> 02:16:09.102]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[02:16:09.782 --> 02:16:15.445]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[02:16:15.445 --> 02:16:21.708]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save InfoWars.
[02:16:21.708 --> 02:16:29.131]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[02:16:29.131 --> 02:16:33.434]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[02:16:33.434 --> 02:16:34.114]  We don't think so.
[02:16:34.654 --> 02:16:39.236]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[02:16:39.236 --> 02:16:40.757]  But we won't let them.
[02:16:40.757 --> 02:16:43.459]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.
[02:16:43.459 --> 02:16:51.683]  With your support, go to SaveInfoWars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[02:16:51.683 --> 02:16:55.345]  SaveInfoWars.com and God bless America.
[02:16:58.988 --> 02:17:04.433]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:17:04.433 --> 02:17:11.701]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:17:11.701 --> 02:17:15.264]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:17:15.264 --> 02:17:19.388]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors.
[02:17:20.269 --> 02:17:31.939]  For the next 15 days, to flatten the curve, I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[02:17:32.757 --> 02:17:43.183]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:17:43.183 --> 02:17:45.925]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:17:45.925 --> 02:17:50.727]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:17:50.727 --> 02:17:56.671]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:17:57.748 --> 02:18:11.096]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation-states on one side, and the globalists on the other, who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[02:18:11.096 --> 02:18:19.402]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, fascist world government.
[02:18:19.402 --> 02:18:25.526]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[02:18:26.647 --> 02:18:31.753]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[02:18:31.753 --> 02:18:42.746]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[02:18:43.487 --> 02:18:45.530]  Now we know, two years ago.
[02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:47.813]  We learned about it about 20 months ago.
[02:18:47.813 --> 02:18:48.414]  It's that simple.
[02:18:48.414 --> 02:18:51.499]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[02:18:51.499 --> 02:18:55.706]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[02:18:55.706 --> 02:18:57.149]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:05.144]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[02:19:05.144 --> 02:19:14.310]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class.
[02:19:14.310 --> 02:19:16.232]  And that's done by design.
[02:19:16.232 --> 02:19:21.395]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[02:19:22.335 --> 02:19:31.128]  They'd look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment that founded the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[02:19:32.159 --> 02:19:37.883]  Until ten years ago the media said, the control corporate media, the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[02:19:37.883 --> 02:19:44.148]  Well now the Bilderberg Group is public and its former head, still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab.
[02:19:44.148 --> 02:19:47.511]  And he has set up the great reset in global government.
[02:19:47.511 --> 02:19:55.617]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalists head on about the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[02:19:55.617 --> 02:19:57.299]  If we do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:02.132]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:38.254 --> 02:20:45.796]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this live November 23rd Tuesday transmission.
[02:20:45.796 --> 02:20:55.078]  This show, this broadcast, this transmission, this human expression of freedom was not supposed to be on air right now.
[02:20:55.078 --> 02:20:56.579]  We're supposed to already be off air.
[02:20:56.579 --> 02:21:02.860]  We're supposed to roll over like everybody else, the globalists, enslaved and dumbed down and killed, but that's not been happening.
[02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:04.301]  Well, a good friend of mine, Jake Ducey's here.
[02:21:04.921 --> 02:21:10.445]  And he is a very well-known best-selling author and also does so many other great works out there.
[02:21:10.445 --> 02:21:25.537]  But he's really helped me in my research and with everything we're doing with the launch of the next level of the InfoWar, which is ResetWars.com, because we were simpatico, because I helped wake him up decades ago.
[02:21:25.537 --> 02:21:28.300]  And his dad's a big fan and the rest of it.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.320]  And so we're now here.
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:31.082]  But before we do the next hour and a half,
[02:21:32.994 --> 02:21:34.896]  Because we cover so much incredible stuff.
[02:21:34.896 --> 02:21:37.398]  I mean, you get exclusives on every front.
[02:21:37.398 --> 02:21:38.359]  You get cutting edge.
[02:21:38.359 --> 02:21:40.420]  You get tomorrow's news today.
[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:42.122]  Because we want you to know what's going on.
[02:21:42.122 --> 02:21:43.302]  The enemy knows what's going on.
[02:21:43.302 --> 02:21:45.064]  They just want to keep you in the dark and enslave you.
[02:21:45.064 --> 02:21:50.528]  I'm not interested in farms of slaves that I can fly over and laugh at you because I feel big.
[02:21:50.528 --> 02:21:52.870]  You not being empowered makes me feel like crap.
[02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:54.912]  You understand how that works?
[02:21:54.912 --> 02:21:59.555]  So I want to see you fly like a birdie because I'm connected to you and you're connected to me.
[02:21:59.555 --> 02:22:01.217]  And I have children in this world.
[02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:03.251]  That are going to live with your children.
[02:22:03.251 --> 02:22:06.034]  And I have ancestors that lived with your ancestors.
[02:22:06.034 --> 02:22:07.115]  You got it?
[02:22:07.115 --> 02:22:08.236]  I'm an individual.
[02:22:08.236 --> 02:22:09.057]  I'm my own soul.
[02:22:09.057 --> 02:22:10.618]  But I'm connected to you.
[02:22:10.618 --> 02:22:14.082]  And when stuff happens to you, it hurts me.
[02:22:14.082 --> 02:22:14.522]  You understand?
[02:22:14.522 --> 02:22:15.403]  I'm not a Satanist.
[02:22:15.403 --> 02:22:16.364]  I'm the opposite.
[02:22:16.364 --> 02:22:17.565]  I'm not all about me.
[02:22:17.565 --> 02:22:20.808]  I'm not all about how I got power over people.
[02:22:20.808 --> 02:22:23.471]  I want you to have power!
[02:22:24.051 --> 02:22:25.012]  You understand that?
[02:22:25.012 --> 02:22:25.872]  That's what I want.
[02:22:25.872 --> 02:22:28.134]  Unlimited consciousness.
[02:22:28.134 --> 02:22:31.137]  And the enemy knows we have that fire in our hands.
[02:22:31.137 --> 02:22:32.337]  And Jake Ducey's here.
[02:22:32.337 --> 02:22:33.018]  Let's talk about it.
[02:22:33.018 --> 02:22:38.502]  But to understand the good, you've got to understand the bad.
[02:22:38.502 --> 02:22:41.985]  And in Reset Wars, we cover the good.
[02:22:41.985 --> 02:22:43.686]  Something I don't spend enough time on.
[02:22:43.686 --> 02:22:45.948]  And the keys to resisting this and decoding it.
[02:22:45.948 --> 02:22:46.969]  But to understand the good,
[02:22:48.953 --> 02:22:51.914]  You must understand the bad.
[02:22:51.914 --> 02:22:55.376]  And so today, we're going to look at the bad.
[02:22:55.376 --> 02:22:59.918]  It is covered some in the six plus hour transmission that's coming out in early December.
[02:22:59.918 --> 02:23:06.222]  But I wanted to just get Jake here to talk about this so that you'd understand some of the research that went into this.
[02:23:06.222 --> 02:23:10.744]  I mean, most people don't sit around and read 800 pages of declassified MKUltra files.
[02:23:11.252 --> 02:23:13.973]  I read him decades ago, he just recently read him again.
[02:23:13.973 --> 02:23:16.474]  We just recently, the last few days, went back over him.
[02:23:16.474 --> 02:23:26.718]  And I want you to understand that when you see reset wars, you think, well, this is just, never heard this in church, never heard this on the news, because they don't want you to know this, because then they can't enslave you.
[02:23:26.718 --> 02:23:31.940]  But when you read the CIA documents, and then you see what we're doing, you'll understand this is the opposite.
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:33.321]  This is how they did it.
[02:23:33.321 --> 02:23:38.223]  Now, there is one little evil shadow to this, but that's the problem with knowledge.
[02:23:38.223 --> 02:23:39.563]  It's good and evil.
[02:23:39.563 --> 02:23:40.444]  It's free will.
[02:23:41.618 --> 02:23:44.100]  Could somebody take this knowledge and use it to enslave people?
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:45.582]  Yeah, they already have.
[02:23:45.582 --> 02:23:48.044]  So, justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:23:48.044 --> 02:23:50.286]  They want to talk about the knowledge of good and evil.
[02:23:50.286 --> 02:23:52.508]  Well, the good don't know about the evil.
[02:23:52.508 --> 02:23:55.771]  So, now we're here exposing how they operate and what's going on.
[02:23:55.771 --> 02:23:59.435]  So, spend five minutes before we go to break and come back and go to the main meat of this.
[02:23:59.435 --> 02:24:05.300]  Current admissions, what's going on, the actual documents, and then what's coming next with Jake Ducey from ResetWars.com.
[02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:05.440]  Jake?
[02:24:06.516 --> 02:24:19.023]  Yeah, what I say is we're all a part of this massive MKUltra experiment that is society, and I've had the honor to actually go through six times and watch Alex's brand new course that's coming out here real soon.
[02:24:19.023 --> 02:24:21.344]  If you are a fan of Alex, if you're a fan of InfoWars,
[02:24:21.744 --> 02:24:36.048]  This is the next level because the way that the Great Reset officially is accomplished is by trapping us into subconscious patterns, convincing us we're just these little bodies, and using everyday mind control weapons that they have.
[02:24:36.048 --> 02:24:40.450]  And Alex breaks down in an 11-step process exactly how to break out of that.
[02:24:40.450 --> 02:24:44.111]  So everyone, open up another browser, go to ResetWars.com
[02:24:45.151 --> 02:24:45.932]  We're good to go!
[02:25:14.991 --> 02:25:15.351]  We're good to go.
[02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:36.354]  So how do we rediscover that person inside of us?
[02:25:36.354 --> 02:25:39.597]  Well, first we have to recognize that they already know all about this, right?
[02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:44.661]  And that's what, they actually use the term de-patterning in their CIA documents.
[02:25:44.661 --> 02:25:47.184]  They use that word in the MKUltra experiments.
[02:25:47.184 --> 02:25:48.205]  De-patterning.
[02:25:48.205 --> 02:25:51.688]  And they describe what that means, we'll cover it next segment, but it means erasing the real you.
[02:25:52.188 --> 02:25:53.589]  Erasing the real you.
[02:25:53.589 --> 02:25:55.770]  And that's the way this whole control system works.
[02:25:55.770 --> 02:25:59.732]  In Reset Wars, you talk about the emotional control grid.
[02:25:59.732 --> 02:26:01.392]  We exist on three planes.
[02:26:01.392 --> 02:26:04.053]  We exist on the physical, the mental, emotional, and the spiritual.
[02:26:04.053 --> 02:26:14.638]  The emotional control grid is all the craziness happening in the world lock us into fear, lock us into anger, lock us into our lower consciousness, our lower emotions, and that's the simulation, right?
[02:26:14.638 --> 02:26:17.860]  Zuckerberg's creating the metaverse, but we're already in a simulation.
[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:20.862]  And that's how the whole control system works.
[02:26:20.862 --> 02:26:29.289]  And that's what fascinated me about your work is once I went into the declassified documents, what struck me more than anything was, wow, we live in a simulation.
[02:26:29.289 --> 02:26:32.832]  All of reality is controlled through subconscious patterning.
[02:26:32.832 --> 02:26:33.752]  They already know this.
[02:26:33.752 --> 02:26:35.334]  And I thought to myself, well, what happens?
[02:26:35.794 --> 02:26:46.577]  If I literally reprogram my entire mind, if I literally program everything, I erase all the viruses and reset words you like in the mind to an operating system.
[02:26:46.577 --> 02:26:50.038]  The programs, the viruses, it's the fake identity.
[02:26:50.038 --> 02:26:57.601]  And that's why I'm so excited about it because... And then we get CIA documents and they admit that, that they know we have an innate from our ancestors, our spirit, who we are.
[02:26:57.601 --> 02:27:01.762]  They try to create this facsimile and then they try to erase who we were, but they didn't really erase it.
[02:27:01.762 --> 02:27:04.163]  They create a false thing that we then follow.
[02:27:05.023 --> 02:27:09.606]  This is what Christ talks about, about being born again, because we're already in Christ, we're already real before.
[02:27:09.606 --> 02:27:13.088]  We fell, we got programmed, now we're born again, we come out of it.
[02:27:13.088 --> 02:27:20.293]  And think about what's interesting, that quote in the Bible is, to not be conformed by the pattern of the world.
[02:27:20.293 --> 02:27:22.875]  They use the same word in the MKUltra documents.
[02:27:22.875 --> 02:27:25.417]  Don't be conformed by the pattern of the world.
[02:27:25.417 --> 02:27:26.818]  What's the pattern of the world?
[02:27:26.818 --> 02:27:33.062]  It's the entire mind control system that they use predictive programming and unconscious hypnosis to control us.
[02:27:33.422 --> 02:27:36.805]  Let me say this, you're going to have the floor when we come back, but I want to explain to everybody something.
[02:27:36.805 --> 02:27:41.489]  Big leftist yesterday, when I did a little piece on this, put a clip in, said, look at Jones, a con man.
[02:27:41.489 --> 02:27:43.591]  He says he knows God and has the secret.
[02:27:43.591 --> 02:27:45.893]  Obviously we all have the secret or connection to God.
[02:27:45.893 --> 02:27:47.334]  Obviously M4 is the tip of the spear.
[02:27:47.334 --> 02:27:49.376]  We're not playing games.
[02:27:49.376 --> 02:27:50.837]  Listen, leftist, you're cut off from God.
[02:27:50.837 --> 02:27:51.878]  You don't get it.
[02:27:51.878 --> 02:27:53.520]  I am connected to God.
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:54.501]  To me, this is real.
[02:27:55.001 --> 02:27:59.606]  They sit there and act like, oh, look, Jones is telling his listeners he's got a connection to God, and blah, blah, blah.
[02:27:59.606 --> 02:28:00.928]  No, it's real!
[02:28:00.928 --> 02:28:04.252]  It really will change the universe if people know it and understand it.
[02:28:04.252 --> 02:28:08.316]  And that's why your bosses are so scared, because they're not like you, some brainwashed minion.
[02:28:08.316 --> 02:28:12.841]  They're aware of this and using this against us, and we're here to set the captives free with Jesus Christ's power.
[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:18.292]  And that's the entire way throughout history the control system has always operated.
[02:28:18.292 --> 02:28:20.414]  That's why they hid certain books of the Bible.
[02:28:20.414 --> 02:28:22.375]  That's why the Vatican has underground libraries.
[02:28:22.375 --> 02:28:31.959]  The way tyranny always controls people is cutting them off from their higher spiritual faculties, convince them they're just a body, even though your body is just a rental car that houses your soul.
[02:28:31.959 --> 02:28:32.960]  I'm here in Austin right now.
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:33.960]  I use a rental car.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:34.721]  It's not my car.
[02:28:34.721 --> 02:28:35.481]  I'm just using it.
[02:28:35.481 --> 02:28:36.842]  Your body is just a rental car.
[02:28:37.182 --> 02:28:38.563]  The whole goal is to cut it off.
[02:28:38.563 --> 02:28:41.984]  I'm a huge fan of Alex, have been for many years, and I know you are too.
[02:28:41.984 --> 02:28:44.806]  Go to ResetWars.com right now and sign up.
[02:28:44.806 --> 02:28:46.727]  This is going to be the most powerful thing you've ever created.

[02:29:13.214 --> 02:29:15.475]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[02:29:15.475 --> 02:29:27.582]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfoilworkstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.

[02:29:31.567 --> 02:29:40.234]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:40.234 --> 02:29:43.697]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.

[02:29:46.559 --> 02:29:56.127]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[02:29:59.608 --> 02:30:01.689]  Your voice counts.

[02:30:06.731 --> 02:30:09.332]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:30:09.332 --> 02:30:10.833]  They know you're angry.
[02:30:10.833 --> 02:30:15.635]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:30:57.287 --> 02:31:02.792]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[02:31:02.792 --> 02:31:09.078]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[02:31:09.078 --> 02:31:14.743]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[02:31:14.743 --> 02:31:20.328]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet, and we need you to help save InfoWars.
[02:31:21.008 --> 02:31:28.413]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[02:31:28.413 --> 02:31:32.736]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[02:31:32.736 --> 02:31:33.937]  We don't think so.
[02:31:33.937 --> 02:31:39.401]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A., but we won't let them.
[02:31:40.041 --> 02:31:44.206]  Alex Jones will have his day in court with your support.
[02:31:44.206 --> 02:31:50.973]  Go to SaveInfoWars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[02:31:50.973 --> 02:31:54.697]  SaveInfoWars.com and God bless America.
[02:31:56.658 --> 02:32:05.123]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:05.123 --> 02:32:15.669]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[02:32:15.669 --> 02:32:25.315]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[02:32:25.655 --> 02:32:31.617]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[02:32:31.617 --> 02:32:36.458]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[02:32:36.458 --> 02:32:44.640]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:49.162]  German Chamomile, Organic Skullcap, and Bavarian Root.
[02:32:49.162 --> 02:33:00.608]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[02:33:00.608 --> 02:33:03.290]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.386 --> 02:33:15.907]  I knew.
[02:33:15.907 --> 02:33:22.734]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.734 --> 02:33:29.580]  Going back four, five, six months ago, and going back two months ago, we were working on this film project, Reset Wars.
[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:40.390]  I told Jake Ducey, who's very successful in his own right, best-selling author and researcher, motivational speaker, that they're going to come at us for this.
[02:33:41.587 --> 02:33:50.973]  And now you see they are really worried about this because we're explaining what the enemy knows and that you don't see on any TV channels, in any newspapers anywhere.
[02:33:50.973 --> 02:34:04.623]  David Icke is the only other person that conceptualizes it but we go into the actual nuts and bolts and then show you in the CIA's own admissions that they're aware of this and then the Bible literally
[02:34:05.967 --> 02:34:08.970]  Being quoted by the CIA and how they control people.
[02:34:08.970 --> 02:34:11.613]  So, Jake, I want to hit all these articles and documents, everything.
[02:34:11.613 --> 02:34:13.696]  We've got over an hour, 20 minutes coming up.
[02:34:13.696 --> 02:34:16.859]  But I want you to have the floor here again to talk about how big this is.
[02:34:16.859 --> 02:34:18.241]  And again, no one raised this.
[02:34:18.241 --> 02:34:19.022]  I always raise.
[02:34:20.307 --> 02:34:32.759]  A converse side, or the flip side, or the parallax view, in that, yeah, if you teach somebody how to use a gun, they might kill somebody one day, or you teach somebody how to drive a car, they might run over somebody one day.
[02:34:32.759 --> 02:34:37.923]  This is all done out of good will, free will, happiness to empower, because good people don't know about this.
[02:34:37.923 --> 02:34:40.266]  The evil people know about this, they use it for control.
[02:34:40.846 --> 02:34:42.327]  So we're showing you how you're controlled.
[02:34:42.327 --> 02:34:44.788]  We're showing you the magic trick right now.
[02:34:44.788 --> 02:34:53.511]  But yes, we leave it to the Holy Spirit to guide you because this is the real, not technology, but this is the real keys to how it all works.
[02:34:53.511 --> 02:34:54.652]  So Jake Ducey, please continue.
[02:34:58.109 --> 02:34:58.829]  We're good to go!
[02:35:27.855 --> 02:35:35.488]  And there's a document in the declassified MKUltra that after I got to watch Alex film his Reset Wars course...
[02:35:36.474 --> 02:35:42.536]  I was reading back through these documents, and I showed him this document, and it's from Dr. Cameron's notes.
[02:35:42.536 --> 02:35:44.156]  You and Cameron.
[02:35:44.156 --> 02:35:48.058]  And it's about a woman who's been asleep for 16 days, because I have her on drugs.
[02:35:48.058 --> 02:35:55.720]  They have her with subliminals, all these control systems going on, and part of the note says, she is sleeping well.
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:03.142]  She is disoriented as to time only, and is probably in her second stage of de-patterning.
[02:36:03.142 --> 02:36:04.203]  And I was like, wow.
[02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:10.831]  You're, you know, you'll see a lot of people cover MKUltra, even the mainstream, New York Times, all these places.
[02:36:10.831 --> 02:36:11.532]  But what do they say?
[02:36:11.532 --> 02:36:13.853]  The headlines are, Horrific Use!
[02:36:13.853 --> 02:36:15.753]  Government Overreach!
[02:36:15.753 --> 02:36:16.634]  Scary Stuff!
[02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:20.731]  But the question is never asked, why are they doing it?
[02:36:20.731 --> 02:36:25.353]  And they're doing it because they realize the mind is literally a computer operating system.
[02:36:25.353 --> 02:36:31.655]  We live in a simulation that's controlled through unconscious consciousness, and they figured out how to manipulate and control it.
[02:36:31.655 --> 02:36:35.857]  And in the same way, the only way that we're going to win is to de-pattern ourselves.
[02:36:35.857 --> 02:36:40.479]  And I used to think I was awake when I would listen to you, and then I realized, well, I'm an MKUltra patient.
[02:36:40.999 --> 02:36:47.447]  I know what's happening, I know about the New World Order, but I'm controlled in my business, in my success, in my finances, in my happiness.
[02:36:47.447 --> 02:36:48.989]  By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:36:48.989 --> 02:36:52.173]  The globalists brag they're externalizing mind control.
[02:36:52.173 --> 02:36:53.474]  That's what the media is.
[02:36:53.474 --> 02:36:55.216]  We are under MKUltra attack.
[02:36:55.876 --> 02:36:57.036]  Absolutely.
[02:36:57.036 --> 02:37:00.738]  And the entire system is perpetuated off of one simple phrase.
[02:37:00.738 --> 02:37:01.338]  I love to say it.
[02:37:01.338 --> 02:37:06.019]  It says, brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[02:37:06.019 --> 02:37:08.800]  Brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:10.881]  And that's the entire de-patterning system.
[02:37:10.881 --> 02:37:15.603]  And in Extreme Examples, Dr. Cameron actually says in one of the documents, they say,
[02:37:16.463 --> 02:37:28.478]  That Cameron believed that breaking down a patient's mind was akin to a childlike state that would allow him to work from a clean slate whereby he could then program the patients.
[02:37:28.478 --> 02:37:31.662]  His term was psychic driving de-patterning.
[02:37:31.662 --> 02:37:33.344]  Psychic driving de-patterning.
[02:37:33.684 --> 02:37:40.327]  Which meant playing recorded messages to patients for up to 20 hours, whether they were asleep or whether they were awake.
[02:37:40.327 --> 02:37:49.492]  And in extreme examples, this woman, Esther Schreier, was so, quote, completely de-patterned, she was mute and had trouble swallowing.
[02:37:49.492 --> 02:37:51.633]  Literally, they erased her mind so much.
[02:37:51.633 --> 02:37:54.054]  I'll give them some background real quick.
[02:37:54.054 --> 02:37:59.496]  Back before they took over History Channel, 20-something years ago, they would admit all this, show the documents, do three-hour documentaries on it.
[02:37:59.496 --> 02:38:00.957]  But I went and looked at the National Archives.
[02:38:00.957 --> 02:38:01.537]  It's all there.
[02:38:01.537 --> 02:38:02.238]  It wasn't made up.
[02:38:03.168 --> 02:38:05.990]  He kidnapped over 10,000 children in the U.S.
[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:13.675]  and Canada, and other programs used CPS to get them, and would keep people asleep sometimes for months with LSD, PCP.
[02:38:13.675 --> 02:38:15.617]  They had video goggles.
[02:38:15.617 --> 02:38:16.618]  You think that's new?
[02:38:16.618 --> 02:38:20.901]  They had earphones, programming them, creating, quote, the ultimate
[02:38:21.781 --> 02:38:23.202]  Assassin.
[02:38:23.202 --> 02:38:29.867]  And so the stuff they released in 77 with the church committee, with MK Ultra, was only a small part of this.
[02:38:29.867 --> 02:38:30.648]  And again, this is 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago.
[02:38:30.648 --> 02:38:31.468]  Imagine what they're doing now.
[02:38:36.656 --> 02:38:50.912]  Imagine what they're doing now, and I think the most amazing part of the whole thing is we now know, and this is why I'm so excited about Reset Wars, and why I say everybody literally go right now, open a browser, go to ResetWars.com because
[02:38:51.673 --> 02:38:57.074]  Throughout history, the way tyranny always wins is to stop us from spiritual awakening.
[02:38:57.074 --> 02:39:07.616]  As long as they trap us in the third dimension, they make us live in an animalistic state of consciousness, believe we're just our physical bodies attached to this little tiny spectrum of visible light, then they win.
[02:39:07.616 --> 02:39:19.318]  But as soon as people start to actually wake up, not just wake up to, hey, pharmaceutical corruption, hey, financial corruption, but actually wake up to who they really are, then the whole game's over.
[02:39:19.798 --> 02:39:23.840]  Because that's what Bill Gates, that's what Klaus Schwab, they all fear people spiritually awakening.
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:32.023]  And that's why they want to target children so young to screw up their normal trajectory towards reaching Christ and the connection to the infinite.
[02:39:32.023 --> 02:39:37.325]  And the point I was going to make earlier, and I always get one thought and jump to the next, is Dr. Ewing Cameron
[02:39:38.649 --> 02:39:40.270]  Was the head of MKUltra.
[02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:41.491]  That's declassified.
[02:39:41.491 --> 02:39:44.812]  Who was his adjunct, his aide-de-camp, his number two?
[02:39:44.812 --> 02:39:52.257]  Jolion West, who was Tim McVeigh's psychologist when he was on death row, and who was Theodore Kaczynski's psychologist.
[02:39:52.257 --> 02:39:55.738]  By the way, later we'll show you LA Times saying that.
[02:39:55.738 --> 02:40:00.121]  Theodore Kaczynski, McVeigh, all mind control.
[02:40:00.121 --> 02:40:04.343]  They had all been deeply grabbed for years, disappeared, family didn't see them.
[02:40:04.343 --> 02:40:07.445]  Put in bays, put in pods like the Matrix, and programmed.
[02:40:07.816 --> 02:40:24.646]  And Alex, even the vaguest shooter, who knows if it's true, but he claims that his mind was erased and hacked and he has text messages that he sent to his wife claiming, who knows if it's true, claiming that they were able to erase his mind and we're going to get to some of those declassified documents.
[02:40:24.646 --> 02:40:26.367]  We know he was a gun runner for the CIA.
[02:40:26.367 --> 02:40:32.211]  And the reason that that's so significant is because when we are going through more of these, they call them non-lethal energy weapons.
[02:40:33.297 --> 02:40:45.661]  They say, they admit, the Pentagon admits that they can use microwaves and electromagnetic frequencies to literally control someone's brain and change their emotions.
[02:40:45.661 --> 02:40:49.003]  And we're going to show you the patents, we're going to show you the news articles, U.S.
[02:40:49.003 --> 02:40:53.764]  News & World Report 20, 30 years ago, and when you read the patents, it's 5G.
[02:40:53.764 --> 02:40:56.965]  5G is a mind control system.
[02:40:56.965 --> 02:40:58.086]  Absolutely.
[02:40:58.086 --> 02:41:01.267]  And I think the whole thing ultimately shows us one simple thing.
[02:41:02.298 --> 02:41:05.880]  The way that we win is when we realize who we really are.
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:06.840]  We are not bodies.
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:09.102]  This is a rental car that I have, that you have.
[02:41:09.102 --> 02:41:11.083]  We're spiritual beings in a physical body.
[02:41:11.083 --> 02:41:16.886]  And when we do that, that's when we get, in the Course, you talk about inspiration, being inspired.
[02:41:16.886 --> 02:41:19.367]  And that's when we tap into that type of place.
[02:41:19.367 --> 02:41:22.228]  Tell them what that means in Latin.
[02:41:22.228 --> 02:41:24.069]  Inspiration means in spirit.
[02:41:26.189 --> 02:41:30.591]  When we're in spirit, whereas Jesus said we are in this world but not of it.
[02:41:30.591 --> 02:41:35.474]  So the whole control system, Alex uses the term, it's called the emotional control grid in the Course.
[02:41:35.474 --> 02:41:47.660]  Emotional control grid, you define it, I watch the Course like six times now, you define it as a mental and emotional plane that they trap you into your emotions, they trap you into your nervous system, so you think you are of this world.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:51.501]  So being inspired is being connected to spirit.
[02:41:51.501 --> 02:41:53.062]  It's when we realize we aren't powerless.
[02:41:53.062 --> 02:41:55.863]  If you're a doctor, you can go start your own private practice.
[02:41:55.863 --> 02:41:58.764]  If you're a teacher, you can go start a new education system.
[02:41:58.764 --> 02:42:03.206]  If you're a broadcaster like Alex, you can become one of the most powerful broadcasters in the world.
[02:42:03.206 --> 02:42:06.808]  Alex started in a closet, in a closet!
[02:42:06.808 --> 02:42:10.970]  And when we're inspired, they don't want us to ask, how can God speak through me right now?
[02:42:10.970 --> 02:42:12.410]  Oh, I totally was led by God.
[02:42:12.410 --> 02:42:13.250]  It wasn't me.
[02:42:13.250 --> 02:42:14.091]  I was a channel.
[02:42:14.864 --> 02:42:18.946]  And when we let go of our mind and our attachment to ourself, that's how we win.
[02:42:18.946 --> 02:42:22.528]  And the whole control system is keeping us in our emotions.
[02:42:22.528 --> 02:42:27.351]  It's trying to get us to give our mind to them in a lower state instead of giving it up to God.
[02:42:27.351 --> 02:42:28.551]  Because you're going to give it up.
[02:42:28.551 --> 02:42:30.552]  You're going to serve somebody like Bob Dylan says.
[02:42:30.552 --> 02:42:31.773]  You're going to give it to God or the devil.
[02:42:32.298 --> 02:42:32.778]  Right.
[02:42:32.778 --> 02:42:37.801]  Give it to the Metaverse, give it to Mark Zuckerberg, give it to the financial system so you believe you can't make any money.
[02:42:37.801 --> 02:42:40.622]  Are you going to give it to God that made you?
[02:42:40.622 --> 02:42:43.784]  Give it to God, ladies and gentlemen, and God will do it.
[02:42:43.784 --> 02:42:44.465]  There's no doubt.
[02:42:44.465 --> 02:42:49.327]  And God is, now that we're under this total attack in the company of the children, God is unlocking the weapons.
[02:42:49.327 --> 02:42:52.989]  We weren't even given this technology until they made the move against the children in the last few months.
[02:42:52.989 --> 02:42:54.410]  That's when we all had this giant awakening.
[02:42:55.193 --> 02:42:59.817]  For a fraction of the info wars, get prepared.
[02:42:59.817 --> 02:43:05.021]  Mega blowout sale 2021 is live right now.
[02:43:05.021 --> 02:43:07.042]  The biggest sale of the year.

[02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:55.632]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:43:58.342 --> 02:44:02.187]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:44:02.187 --> 02:44:06.512]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:44:06.512 --> 02:44:15.042]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:15.362 --> 02:44:31.972]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:44:31.972 --> 02:44:37.815]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate
[02:44:38.055 --> 02:44:43.579]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film, In Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:45:04.685 --> 02:45:16.870]  In that documentary, I predicted the globalists would establish world government by releasing a virus, demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:17.570]  And now they've done it.
[02:45:18.587 --> 02:45:19.667]  How did I know they would do it?
[02:45:19.667 --> 02:45:26.309]  Because they wrote books, and white papers, and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:31.210]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg Group, whose head at the time was Klaus Schwab.
[02:45:31.210 --> 02:45:36.371]  And our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this Great Reset.
[02:45:36.371 --> 02:45:37.732]  Well, we're now living in it.
[02:45:37.732 --> 02:45:43.993]  The purposeful collapse of the Third World and the First World, known as ASS, the tyrannical corporate world government.
[02:45:43.993 --> 02:45:45.574]  Total censorship, no due process.
[02:45:46.754 --> 02:45:47.775]  I know you're humble.
[02:45:47.775 --> 02:45:49.716]  I know you're like me.
[02:45:49.716 --> 02:45:52.937]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate
[02:46:06.693 --> 02:46:14.277]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[02:46:14.277 --> 02:46:27.685]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[02:46:27.685 --> 02:46:29.906]  The tip of the spear is Banned.Billionaire.
[02:46:29.906 --> 02:46:33.028]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.
[02:46:34.071 --> 02:46:38.714]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[02:46:38.714 --> 02:46:43.558]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:46:43.558 --> 02:46:45.079]  That's SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:46:45.079 --> 02:46:56.327]  And continue to go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours of clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[02:46:59.962 --> 02:47:08.808]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:08.808 --> 02:47:21.978]  You may be an ambassador to England
[02:47:29.325 --> 02:47:41.294]  I'm just gonna say it, this is very close to what the devil did in the Garden of Eden.
[02:47:41.294 --> 02:47:46.378]  What we're doing on there right now.
[02:47:46.378 --> 02:47:49.060]  And I just gotta be honest with the listeners, that's what this is.
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:50.341]  But it's the other way back.
[02:47:50.341 --> 02:47:52.943]  You see, they already did it to us before to forget who we were.
[02:47:52.943 --> 02:47:54.865]  Now we gotta wake up to that fact.
[02:47:54.865 --> 02:47:56.446]  I gotta tell you that story again.
[02:47:58.015 --> 02:48:03.056]  This is like the snake coming down the tree, talking to Eve and talking to Adam.
[02:48:03.056 --> 02:48:06.597]  We were perfect because we were following God's pattern.
[02:48:06.597 --> 02:48:09.218]  And then a new pattern was put in.
[02:48:09.218 --> 02:48:17.860]  But it feels dirty to even go back to that moment to be there at the tree and to say, hey, you want to get rid of this pattern, you can have God's pattern.
[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:18.701]  But that's what this is.
[02:48:18.701 --> 02:48:20.481]  You've got to serve somebody.
[02:48:20.481 --> 02:48:25.162]  My whole will, everything I am, is about being straight with you.
[02:48:25.162 --> 02:48:27.063]  That's why they say Alex Jones is never wrong.
[02:48:27.512 --> 02:48:30.135]  No, I'm right about 97% of the time.
[02:48:30.135 --> 02:48:30.536]  Sometimes I get...
[02:48:32.577 --> 02:48:36.740]  Distorted or get sped up or get something wrong or see it wrong and later I tell you I'm wrong.
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:37.220]  I'm wrong.
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:37.640]  I'm wrong.
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:56.753]  I'm wrong But I mean you're right 97% of the time, you know, what's going on, you know, you've no comment You don't you already innately don't need the news to tell you you and knowing your spirit Your spirit's so old so powerful so real made by God man You were built by the most amazing things ever been you were you rolled off the assembly line
[02:48:57.634 --> 02:48:59.676]  Like, smoking hot.
[02:48:59.676 --> 02:49:15.509]  And we're here simply trying to get everybody to realize we can fight all the enemy's attacks, we can fight all the racism and all the sexism and all the stuff they spew in the name of stopping it, or we can just reach up to the divine and grasp what was already given to us.
[02:49:16.129 --> 02:49:24.817]  We're giving the false apple of, I'll tell you about the universe, just do this with me over here, instead of like, no, you gotta reach up even higher, and God's hand is reaching down.
[02:49:24.817 --> 02:49:30.582]  So let's start, we got a whole other hour coming up, Jake Ducey here, but let's start getting into the documents and the facts here.
[02:49:30.582 --> 02:49:43.332]  But the point is, we're not, all the churches and all the systems, the Islamics, the mainline Christians, all the big systems, Hollywood, all of it, is about going through them.
[02:49:44.315 --> 02:49:51.218]  And they know you're already looking, but they want you to try to... Jesus was like, no more temples, no more priests, pray in the middle of the night at 3 a.m.
[02:49:51.218 --> 02:49:52.499]  I read that when I was a kid.
[02:49:52.499 --> 02:49:53.139]  I said, what does that mean?
[02:49:53.139 --> 02:49:53.680]  It's Sunday school.
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:55.681]  That's when I get the transmissions at 3 a.m.
[02:49:55.681 --> 02:49:56.641]  I wake up at 3 a.m.
[02:49:56.641 --> 02:50:04.025]  That's when I always get the big, whatever reason, I mean, even the yogi, Ava Vedix, all those people tell you that it's 3 a.m., whatever goes on then.
[02:50:04.645 --> 02:50:08.066]  This is about your relationship with God who created the infinite.
[02:50:08.066 --> 02:50:09.487]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:50:09.487 --> 02:50:11.747]  The point is, this is what they don't want.
[02:50:11.747 --> 02:50:13.768]  This is what they don't understand.
[02:50:13.768 --> 02:50:17.669]  And it's not something we have that we're giving to you.
[02:50:17.669 --> 02:50:25.252]  This is something we want you to realize is already there that will end Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates the moment you begin down that real path.
[02:50:26.104 --> 02:50:42.959]  Yeah well the reason that I think Reset War is going to be so powerful and why I think they're really going to be mad when it's out is because you even think about the race baiting, everything that happens, all the division, it's perpetuated off of one simple idea and that's to convince us that we're just our bodies.
[02:50:43.739 --> 02:50:54.101]  It wasn't that long ago if you asked me who I was, I would have said, my name's Jake Ducey, I'm six foot three, this is, I have blue eyes, this is how long my hair is, this is who I am.
[02:50:54.101 --> 02:50:57.802]  But this is just a rental car, it's a fingernail to who I really am.
[02:50:57.802 --> 02:51:00.042]  And how empowering is it once you realize that?
[02:51:00.042 --> 02:51:10.465]  It's incredibly empowering, and here's what's something that's so interesting, I sent you this text the other day on my YouTube channel, someone left a comment, and they said, as a black man,
[02:51:12.885 --> 02:51:25.335]  I don't know how this blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy's videos popped up, but I don't want to watch you because legacy media has told me, because you're white, you're a racist, you're evil, you're the devil.
[02:51:25.335 --> 02:51:37.625]  But, while I'm listening to your video right now, I have this deep fear that actually, we all come from the same source, and they've been lying to me.
[02:51:37.625 --> 02:51:38.125]  He knows!
[02:51:38.846 --> 02:51:39.767]  He was waking up to it.
[02:51:39.767 --> 02:51:40.467]  He doesn't need you.
[02:51:40.467 --> 02:51:42.289]  We're just saying, look at the light.
[02:51:42.289 --> 02:51:42.990]  Exactly.
[02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:55.380]  And that's why I said tyranny only works if you convince people that they're just a body and that you make them subconsciously, habitually conform to the patterns of this world.
[02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:56.782]  And that's why I love... Go back to the Bible.
[02:51:56.782 --> 02:51:57.362]  Pull up the verse.
[02:51:57.362 --> 02:51:57.822]  I forget where it is.
[02:51:57.822 --> 02:51:59.364]  It's like, don't conform to the pattern of the world.
[02:51:59.764 --> 02:52:06.367]  Be not conformed by the pattern of the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[02:52:06.367 --> 02:52:08.748]  And in the course, you talk about transform.
[02:52:08.748 --> 02:52:11.769]  Trans is beyond and form meaning the physical world.
[02:52:11.769 --> 02:52:13.569]  That's why they create a counterfeit of trans.
[02:52:13.569 --> 02:52:15.230]  Take chemicals, cut your penis off.
[02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:15.750]  No.
[02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:17.371]  Transformation is this energy.
[02:52:18.433 --> 02:52:21.134]  Absolutely, and how does this whole control system work?
[02:52:21.134 --> 02:52:34.657]  And this is why Reset Wars is so powerful, and that's why everyone needs to open up a web browser, go to ResetWars.com and sign up, because we have this all in government documents, and we now know through new neuroscience that shows us how this whole thing works.
[02:52:34.657 --> 02:52:37.618]  Every time you have an emotion, you activate cells in your brain.
[02:52:37.618 --> 02:52:42.179]  Through Hebb's Law, which is a term in neuroscience that says that cells that fire together, wire together.
[02:52:42.179 --> 02:52:45.320]  Every time you have an emotion, you activate cells that build a neurological connection.
[02:52:45.320 --> 02:52:46.120]  They're programming your brain.
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:47.980]  And they know it!
[02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:51.261]  Here's a document from the U.S.
[02:52:51.261 --> 02:53:00.404]  Army College of War, and they say, quote, the mind has no innate firewall to protect itself from electromagnetic weapons.
[02:53:00.404 --> 02:53:01.885]  What's an electromagnetic weapon?
[02:53:01.885 --> 02:53:03.465]  Well, what's anything?
[02:53:03.465 --> 02:53:05.826]  This is just an electromagnetic field.
[02:53:05.826 --> 02:53:10.288]  There's no such thing as matter in your- Could you describe this in the Pentagon documents from the 60s and 70s?
[02:53:11.917 --> 02:53:13.999]  That we are these energy creatures they're controlling.
[02:53:13.999 --> 02:53:14.540]  They say it.
[02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:15.541]  We're going to show all this.
[02:53:15.541 --> 02:53:20.106]  And they have all the, I mean there's hundreds and thousands, I mean it's kind of freaky.
[02:53:20.106 --> 02:53:21.888]  Non-lethal electromagnetic weapons.
[02:53:21.888 --> 02:53:22.649]  All these things.
[02:53:22.649 --> 02:53:24.011]  So you think, what are you?
[02:53:24.011 --> 02:53:27.295]  Well, it looks like I stop right here and Alex stops right here.
[02:53:27.295 --> 02:53:28.796]  But you and I are a field of energy.
[02:53:28.796 --> 02:53:29.237]  My field...
[02:53:29.597 --> 02:53:31.799]  Just about right there in our field's joint.
[02:53:31.799 --> 02:53:33.420]  Everything is just a field.
[02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:47.309]  And Max Planck, the father of quantum physics, you quote him in your course, he says, as a man who's devoted, he won the Nobel Prize in 1913, he says, as a man who's devoted his entire life to the most clear-headed science in the world, the study of atoms, I can tell you this much.
[02:53:47.309 --> 02:53:50.412]  There's no matter as such.
[02:53:50.412 --> 02:53:53.214]  So the electromagnetic weapons are important because what are we?
[02:53:53.214 --> 02:53:55.255]  We're an electromagnetic field of energy.
[02:53:55.255 --> 02:53:57.897]  And the key is its observation, which is the quantum physics.
[02:53:59.187 --> 02:54:03.450]  Other than microwaves that will physically kill you, if you're aware of the attack, you can defeat it.
[02:54:03.450 --> 02:54:06.413]  But you've got to, because your will controls the field.
[02:54:06.413 --> 02:54:08.334]  Not some stupid machine firing it.
[02:54:08.334 --> 02:54:11.136]  And that's why I love to say that we're all MKUltra patient.
[02:54:11.136 --> 02:54:15.660]  Once we realize this, it is our responsibility to deprogram, depattern ourselves.
[02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:18.102]  Just going and yelling and protesting isn't going to change it.
[02:54:18.102 --> 02:54:19.823]  We all have to change ourselves.
[02:54:19.823 --> 02:54:26.208]  And so it says, in these sections of the Army documents, they talk about how the mind has no firewall, right?
[02:54:26.208 --> 02:54:27.029]  One of the things China
[02:54:27.549 --> 02:54:28.110]  We're good to go.
[02:54:44.031 --> 02:54:57.154]  And once we realize that, and we realize they've got all these low frequency radiation waves, electromagnetic weapons, and that can influence the brain and the mind, they say it.
[02:54:57.154 --> 02:55:09.076]  The head of DARPA, the old head of DARPA, says that they figured out how to use electromagnetic weapons to quote, induce the brain to release behavioral regulatory chemicals.
[02:55:09.076 --> 02:55:11.797]  They described the frequency they were using in the 70s, and it's 5G.
[02:55:13.197 --> 02:55:14.698]  And that's the 70s, right?
[02:55:14.698 --> 02:55:28.644]  Yeah, imagine folks, I mean, this is, they're literally putting, I've got the Baltimore Sun article in the stack here, we'll cover it next hour, where they were saying in the 90s, oh, cell towers are going to also calm the public like Prozac.
[02:55:28.644 --> 02:55:32.746]  I mean, that's what I'm saying is this is happening.
[02:55:32.746 --> 02:55:40.610]  And that's why it's so important that we all take a breath, realize we're not a body,
[02:55:41.761 --> 02:55:43.964]  Because you can feel the energy all the time.
[02:55:43.964 --> 02:55:46.387]  If you just go, is there life in my hands?
[02:55:46.387 --> 02:55:50.612]  And don't ask your mind as a yes or no question, but bring your attention to your hand.
[02:55:50.612 --> 02:55:51.753]  Can I feel the energy?
[02:55:51.753 --> 02:55:53.054]  Can I feel the life in my hands?
[02:55:53.834 --> 02:55:55.755]  That's the moment I really woke up, right?
[02:55:55.755 --> 02:56:03.820]  I was watching Endgame, I was doing all these things, and I was a freshman in college, and I was listening to an audiobook, and the guy said, is there life in your hands?
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:05.681]  Can you feel the energy in your hands?
[02:56:05.681 --> 02:56:08.282]  And it was the first time I ever separated from my mind.
[02:56:08.282 --> 02:56:14.125]  Yeah, your brain connects and goes, my brain's in control of this, and there's something beyond my mind that's in control of it.
[02:56:14.125 --> 02:56:16.607]  That's when you actually stand up.
[02:56:16.607 --> 02:56:18.648]  Yeah, we aren't our thoughts.
[02:56:18.648 --> 02:56:20.269]  We aren't our thoughts, we are our body.
[02:56:21.192 --> 02:56:24.013]  And we're in control of it, just like a computer operating system.
[02:56:24.013 --> 02:56:29.074]  That's what I love about the Reset Wars course, because you go step by step, and you liken the mind.
[02:56:29.074 --> 02:56:33.096]  We're in a simulation, and you liken the mind to a computer operating system.
[02:56:33.096 --> 02:56:37.257]  They have installed the operating system and the viruses into our computer.
[02:56:37.697 --> 02:56:42.702]  It's happened for so long that we believed all the emotions and all the thoughts.
[02:56:42.702 --> 02:56:45.445]  We've memorized the pattern through our nervous system.
[02:56:45.445 --> 02:56:46.386]  So we think it's who we are.
[02:56:46.386 --> 02:56:47.467]  We think we aren't confident.
[02:56:47.467 --> 02:56:50.630]  We think we aren't as powerful as Elon Musk, as Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:59.800]  There's so many people that look up to Alex Jones and they want to be powerful and make a difference in the world like Alex Jones, but they think Alex is somehow more powerful.
[02:57:00.140 --> 02:57:09.149]  We all have to wake up to the fact that we are connected to this divine power and through inspiration we can transform our mind.
[02:57:09.149 --> 02:57:11.831]  We can think and feel greater than our environment.
[02:57:11.831 --> 02:57:13.553]  That's how we access new ideas.
[02:57:13.553 --> 02:57:14.594]  That's how we change the world.
[02:57:14.594 --> 02:57:18.358]  We must come out of the world and then get into spirit and then take over the world.
[02:57:18.757 --> 02:57:20.398]  In this world, but not other, right?
[02:57:20.398 --> 02:57:21.539]  Absolutely.
[02:57:21.539 --> 02:57:22.600]  And that's why it's so cool.
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:27.965]  It's like Alex Jones put together, reverse-engineered all their secret studies.
[02:57:27.965 --> 02:57:32.028]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is weaponized mind control, but to free people.
[02:57:32.028 --> 02:57:33.930]  This is the keys to MKUltra.
[02:57:33.930 --> 02:57:40.835]  This is the keys to MKUltra, and all these other documents that they're using, they want you to feel alone, and if you do... Hold on, let's start the fourth hour.
[02:57:40.835 --> 02:57:42.637]  We'll cover all the documents straight ahead.
[02:57:42.637 --> 02:57:44.999]  ResetWars.com
[02:57:46.124 --> 02:57:46.865]  For a fraction?
[02:58:03.228 --> 02:58:05.509]  Again, so many toxins out.
[02:58:05.509 --> 02:58:17.615]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfoldworkstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[02:58:17.615 --> 02:58:20.476]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[02:58:21.468 --> 02:58:30.132]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at MFootwearStore.com.
[02:58:30.132 --> 02:58:33.594]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[02:58:33.594 --> 02:58:36.455]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[02:58:36.455 --> 02:58:41.437]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[02:58:41.437 --> 02:58:43.758]  Clean energy without the big crash.
[02:58:43.758 --> 02:58:46.860]  It's available right now and it funds the MFootwear 360 win.
[02:58:46.860 --> 02:58:48.261]  I know you're humble.
[02:58:48.261 --> 02:58:48.961]  I know you're like me.
[02:58:49.940 --> 02:59:02.790]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:03.271]  And now as 2021
[02:59:06.141 --> 02:59:08.842]  Prepares to end at 2022.
[02:59:08.842 --> 02:59:09.663]  Begins to dawn.
[02:59:09.663 --> 02:59:16.186]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[02:59:16.186 --> 02:59:18.407]  The tip of the spear is Van.Vilja.
[02:59:18.407 --> 02:59:21.549]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is MFORWARS.com.
[02:59:22.586 --> 02:59:27.231]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[02:59:27.231 --> 02:59:32.075]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:59:32.075 --> 02:59:33.597]  That's SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:59:33.597 --> 02:59:44.848]  And continue to go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force sold out for months, 10 hours of clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[02:59:48.536 --> 02:59:54.441]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:07.077 --> 03:00:17.030]  Alright, some stations do not pick up this first five minutes.
[03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:21.456]  We're gonna hit the full breakdown coming up here in about six minutes.
[03:00:21.456 --> 03:00:22.678]  But Jake Ducey's here with us.
[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:26.961]  This is, yeah, don't let them mold your mind.
[03:00:26.961 --> 03:00:29.022]  Take control of your mind.
[03:00:29.022 --> 03:00:31.083]  Be aware of how they manipulate your mind.
[03:00:31.083 --> 03:00:31.964]  You'll be stronger.
[03:00:31.964 --> 03:00:38.467]  Don't go to some psychologist or psychiatrist in the system telling you you're a failure, you're weak, it's over, they got pills for you.
[03:00:38.467 --> 03:00:40.508]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:40.508 --> 03:00:42.048]  Transcend it all, don't be a victim.
[03:00:42.048 --> 03:00:46.590]  But I got a compilation of Fauci flip-flopping statements and comments on Mask.
[03:00:46.590 --> 03:00:51.333]  And then Dr. Robert Malone, the future of global totalitarianism is here.
[03:00:52.173 --> 03:00:59.740]  This is so incredibly powerful, these two clips that go together.
[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:02.482]  So I hope that you share this information right now.
[03:01:02.482 --> 03:01:03.703]  Jake Ducey is our guest.
[03:01:03.703 --> 03:01:08.548]  We're going to come right back on the other side of this break and lay it all out today.
[03:01:08.548 --> 03:01:12.071]  And believe me, I don't, you know, I don't tell you stuff that's BS.
[03:01:12.071 --> 03:01:13.532]  We're not about hoaxes.
[03:01:13.532 --> 03:01:14.733]  We're about reality.
[03:01:14.733 --> 03:01:15.374]  So stay with us.
[03:01:17.003 --> 03:01:21.707]  Let me just state for the record that masks are not theater.
[03:01:21.707 --> 03:01:24.870]  Wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better.
[03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:26.712]  Masks are protective.
[03:01:26.712 --> 03:01:30.615]  But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.
[03:01:30.615 --> 03:01:36.220]  There has not been any indication that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:36.340]  Well, I
[03:01:52.114 --> 03:01:53.075]  You've been vaccinated.
[03:01:53.075 --> 03:01:59.723]  Good that you're vaccinated, but in a situation where you have people indoors, particularly crowded, you should wear a mask.
[03:01:59.723 --> 03:02:02.927]  So even if you are vaccinated, you should wear a mask.
[03:02:02.927 --> 03:02:09.555]  If in fact you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, you are protected, and you do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors.
[03:02:09.795 --> 03:02:14.377]  When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks?
[03:02:14.377 --> 03:02:23.801]  You know, if you look at children outside, particularly when they're with the family, walking down the street, playing a game or what have you, don't have to wear a mask.
[03:02:23.801 --> 03:02:31.685]  The pediatric, the Academy of Pediatric actually makes that recommendation that children should be wearing masks from two years old on.
[03:02:32.005 --> 03:02:39.767]  And you're asking now, if your child is a member of your household, can you walk outdoors with your child without a mask?
[03:02:39.767 --> 03:02:42.547]  According to that chart, the answer is yes.
[03:02:42.547 --> 03:02:45.528]  But the child can't, not to beat it to death?
[03:02:45.528 --> 03:02:46.268]  Yes, yes.
[03:02:46.268 --> 03:02:49.929]  Because now the CDC says, I mean, I think I've got this right.
[03:02:49.929 --> 03:02:52.110]  One mask is better than zero masks.
[03:02:52.110 --> 03:02:54.110]  Two masks is better than one mask.
[03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:56.251]  But you don't have to have double masks.
[03:02:56.251 --> 03:02:56.951]  Is that right?
[03:02:57.751 --> 03:03:05.054]  You know, it became clear that cloth coverings, that you didn't have to buy in a store, that you could make yourself, were adequate.
[03:03:05.054 --> 03:03:06.875]  And then you wanted to fit better.
[03:03:06.875 --> 03:03:18.860]  So one of the ways you could do it, if you would like to, is put a cloth mask over, which actually, here and here and here, where you could get leakage in, is much better contained.
[03:03:18.860 --> 03:03:20.701]  Are you a double masker, Dr. Fauci?
[03:03:20.701 --> 03:03:22.082]  You look like you are!
[03:03:22.082 --> 03:03:26.984]  In terms of the virus, and, you know, the virus is really
[03:03:27.619 --> 03:03:36.865]  It seems increasingly to be a platform in the jab for advancing other agendas, including political agendas.
[03:03:36.865 --> 03:03:45.690]  I like to say, and please quote me on this, the future of global totalitarianism is here, it's just not evenly distributed.
[03:03:45.690 --> 03:03:56.697]  What we're seeing in Canada, Australia, Austria now is the most egregious example, sounds like we may be seeing it in Germany soon, is the
[03:03:58.078 --> 03:04:05.563]  Deployment of a totalitarian approach to this whole thing, and it is amazingly coordinated.
[03:04:05.563 --> 03:04:10.247]  We could, you know, that's another half an hour discussion about how this is happening.
[03:04:10.247 --> 03:04:23.616]  But what I think we're seeing with the governments like Austria is the symptom of what Mathias, Professor Mathias Desmet is talking about more and more, and many of us find a lot of traction in his thoughts.
[03:04:23.616 --> 03:04:25.678]  It's called mass formation psychosis.
[03:04:26.693 --> 03:04:31.654]  Basically, it's the madness of crowds, would be a simple way to put it.
[03:04:31.654 --> 03:04:39.056]  And a lot of these governments have been overtaken by this form of psychosis or hypnosis.
[03:04:39.056 --> 03:04:42.197]  They believe that these vaccines are effective.
[03:04:42.197 --> 03:04:43.777]  They're clearly not.
[03:04:43.777 --> 03:04:50.559]  They are impervious to data, just in the same way that we're seeing our own government impervious to actual facts.
[03:04:55.723 --> 03:04:56.744]  There are so many.
[03:05:16.238 --> 03:05:17.919]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[03:05:17.919 --> 03:05:18.859]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[03:05:18.859 --> 03:05:19.079]  Go ahead.
[03:05:19.079 --> 03:05:19.640]  Hey, Alex.
[03:05:19.640 --> 03:05:20.780]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:23.782]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[03:05:23.782 --> 03:05:25.462]  The X Team does wonders.
[03:05:25.462 --> 03:05:26.723]  I recommend it to everybody.
[03:05:26.723 --> 03:05:27.783]  You're on the fence about it.
[03:05:27.783 --> 03:05:28.584]  Get off the fence.
[03:05:28.584 --> 03:05:29.384]  Get the product.
[03:05:29.384 --> 03:05:30.685]  Support the info war.
[03:05:30.685 --> 03:05:31.965]  Tyler in Maine.
[03:05:31.965 --> 03:05:32.606]  You're on the air.
[03:05:32.606 --> 03:05:33.146]  Thanks for calling.
[03:05:33.166 --> 03:05:33.546]  Go ahead.
[03:05:33.546 --> 03:05:35.228]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[03:05:35.228 --> 03:05:35.989]  It's an honor.
[03:05:35.989 --> 03:05:36.269]  Honor.
[03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:36.830]  Talk to you.
[03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:37.951]  Awesome.
[03:05:37.951 --> 03:05:41.555]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the products.
[03:05:41.555 --> 03:05:43.637]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[03:05:43.637 --> 03:05:46.140]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:47.481]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[03:05:47.481 --> 03:05:49.163]  So, just number one for a few of the other guys.
[03:05:49.163 --> 03:05:50.144]  Well, it definitely works.
[03:05:50.144 --> 03:05:51.766]  It's not a joke.
[03:05:51.766 --> 03:05:52.527]  Absolutely.
[03:06:07.745 --> 03:06:12.869]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[03:06:12.869 --> 03:06:19.914]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:19.914 --> 03:06:24.077]  Alright, Reset Wars with Jake Dizzy, Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:25.310 --> 03:06:32.493]  Let's start getting into all these documents, the history, the controlling, what they admit they're doing, how they're trying to erase our personalities.
[03:06:32.493 --> 03:06:35.414]  They were beta testing in the 50s, 60s, 70s.
[03:06:35.414 --> 03:06:37.855]  The last time it was declassified was 77.
[03:06:37.855 --> 03:06:40.676]  We can see it now all on a mass scale.
[03:06:40.676 --> 03:06:44.317]  And I've got a bunch of articles where they admit they're currently doing it to us.
[03:06:44.317 --> 03:06:48.539]  So shouldn't people be aware of what's currently being done to them?
[03:06:49.465 --> 03:06:50.746]  Yeah, this one's fascinating.
[03:06:50.746 --> 03:06:53.708]  This one is from Richard Cesaro.
[03:06:53.708 --> 03:07:00.753]  He's the Deputy Director, was the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects, DARPA.
[03:07:00.753 --> 03:07:02.574]  This is an actual quote.
[03:07:02.574 --> 03:07:13.442]  He says, quote, In our experiments, we did some remarkable things, and there was no question in my mind that you can get into the brain with microwaves.
[03:07:14.042 --> 03:07:20.967]  If you really make the breakthrough, you've got something better than any bomb ever built.
[03:07:20.967 --> 03:07:28.152]  Because when you finally come down the line, you're talking about controlling people's minds.
[03:07:28.152 --> 03:07:29.173]  So that's their argument.
[03:07:29.173 --> 03:07:35.118]  Put in the 5G, so no one riots, so no one's bad, but their depopulation is doing it.
[03:07:35.118 --> 03:07:39.521]  It'd be bad enough if good guys put this in, but these are bad guys that put this in.
[03:07:40.609 --> 03:07:45.114]  And that's how the whole entire control system continues to perpetuate itself.
[03:07:45.114 --> 03:07:53.582]  And that's why everything is designed to trap us into the, as you talk about in the course, the emotional control grid, the emotional control grid.
[03:07:53.582 --> 03:08:03.051]  When we were, I was laughing when we were watching that clip of the masks, because I was thinking even masks are another example of trapping you into your physical body.
[03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:07.941]  It's another anchor that brings you back into lower emotions.
[03:08:07.941 --> 03:08:13.022]  You're afraid of dying, even though you can't die because everything's energy and energy's never created or destroyed.
[03:08:13.022 --> 03:08:14.682]  It's only transferred to different states.
[03:08:14.682 --> 03:08:16.242]  First law of thermodynamics.
[03:08:16.242 --> 03:08:20.983]  Yeah, so you can't die, but the whole system has to get you into the emotion of fear.
[03:08:20.983 --> 03:08:26.845]  So the mask just traps you back into the matrix, into the third dimension, so you think you're just a little physical body.
[03:08:26.845 --> 03:08:28.685]  It's a symbol of that you're a prisoner.
[03:08:29.514 --> 03:08:30.715]  Simple that you're a prisoner.
[03:08:30.715 --> 03:08:35.377]  And it's just another example of moving you back into the matrix.
[03:08:35.377 --> 03:08:49.284]  And that's why I think they're going to be so mad when they find out that you broke everything down step by step by step in Reset Wars because this whole thing isn't just off of us waking up because so many people that are awake still think we're powerless.
[03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:50.365]  They still think we can't win.
[03:08:50.365 --> 03:08:51.645]  They're still debt slaves.
[03:08:51.645 --> 03:08:52.986]  That's a key point you make.
[03:08:52.986 --> 03:08:53.326]  No, no.
[03:08:53.326 --> 03:08:53.907]  We're awake.
[03:08:53.907 --> 03:08:54.507]  We're powerful.
[03:08:55.728 --> 03:08:56.809]  And that's what has to happen.
[03:08:56.809 --> 03:09:01.033]  We have to realize that we are powerful.
[03:09:01.033 --> 03:09:04.096]  And that's how the entire game operates.
[03:09:04.096 --> 03:09:08.880]  And that's why ResetWars is so powerful.
[03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:10.862]  You got it coming out the beginning of December.
[03:09:10.862 --> 03:09:13.444]  Everybody go to ResetWars.com.
[03:09:13.444 --> 03:09:15.266]  Sign up right now.
[03:09:15.266 --> 03:09:20.851]  ResetWars.com and sign up right now for the early bird list because, look, they've got all these.
[03:09:20.851 --> 03:09:21.171]  They say,
[03:09:23.408 --> 03:09:41.501]  DARPA, quote, the aim of the program is to remotely disrupt political dissonance and extremism by employing transgranular magnetic stimulation in tandem with sophisticated propaganda based on this technology.
[03:09:41.501 --> 03:09:43.443]  And then you read it, it's 5G basically.
[03:09:44.073 --> 03:09:47.176]  Yeah, so the entire, I mean, and think about that.
[03:09:47.176 --> 03:09:50.738]  Think about what the metaverse probably actually has, right?
[03:09:50.738 --> 03:10:01.247]  Zuckerberg wants to duct tape this mask onto your head and you, 24 hours a day, we stay in it and we only break out of it to eat some cricket protein, ground up cricket protein powder or something like that.
[03:10:01.247 --> 03:10:05.750]  And that's the way this whole, it's, it's just to get into our brainwave state and
[03:10:06.721 --> 03:10:10.283]  That's why all of this is so powerful because at the end of the day it brings us back to what?
[03:10:10.283 --> 03:10:14.265]  It brings us back to brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[03:10:14.265 --> 03:10:17.987]  And by the way, they just typed in what you said from a 1970s document.
[03:10:17.987 --> 03:10:21.149]  There was mainstream news, the army doing it to the troops.
[03:10:21.149 --> 03:10:22.249]  And they used to cover it.
[03:10:22.249 --> 03:10:26.312]  Yeah, all of these things have like New York Times, Associated Press.
[03:10:26.312 --> 03:10:28.373]  Yeah, like even 10, 20 years ago they'd cover it.
[03:10:28.373 --> 03:10:28.853]  Now they don't.
[03:10:29.653 --> 03:10:33.998]  Yeah, now they don't cover it at all, but you can still find the old documents.
[03:10:33.998 --> 03:10:36.321]  Well, see, that metaphysically, that was their fine print.
[03:10:36.321 --> 03:10:41.127]  It's kind of like when you're going to demolish a house or take over, you publish it in the paper you're doing it.
[03:10:41.127 --> 03:10:42.989]  They kind of tell you.
[03:10:42.989 --> 03:10:45.011]  They tell you 20 years before, then they do it.
[03:10:45.626 --> 03:10:52.869]  And that's what's so powerful about all this, because all you did is find the entire playbook of how reality is created.
[03:10:52.869 --> 03:10:56.091]  I mean, we haven't even touched on quantum physics.
[03:10:56.091 --> 03:11:00.753]  We'll do that in the last segment of the show, but let's look at some of these overhead shot plays, guys.
[03:11:01.923 --> 03:11:03.665]  Here's a small smattering of these.
[03:11:03.665 --> 03:11:05.246]  Here's one in Telegraph.
[03:11:05.246 --> 03:11:11.551]  Use of fear-to-control behavior in COVID crisis was totalitarian, scientists admit.
[03:11:11.551 --> 03:11:17.657]  Government mind-control systems were used, including classified systems, to ensure compliance.
[03:11:17.657 --> 03:11:19.859]  Wonder what that was.
[03:11:19.859 --> 03:11:21.180]  The next outbreak.
[03:11:21.180 --> 03:11:23.982]  Why we're not ready.
[03:11:23.982 --> 03:11:26.585]  Medical and psychological emergency units.
[03:11:28.823 --> 03:11:34.846]  Lockdown is the world's biggest psychological experiment and we will pay the price.
[03:11:34.846 --> 03:11:39.008]  The biggest psychological experiment in history is running now, Scientific American.
[03:11:39.008 --> 03:11:43.310]  They admit, like you're an animal, they're doing this in their own publications.
[03:11:43.310 --> 03:11:46.092]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:11:47.327 --> 03:11:52.334]  How they're running these operations, and how they prepared it, and how they admit it.
[03:11:52.334 --> 03:11:59.222]  The CIA secret quest for mind control, torture, LSD, and a poisoner-in-chief.
[03:11:59.222 --> 03:12:02.687]  I've only started to get into all this, Jake.
[03:12:04.312 --> 03:12:22.857]  Yeah, and again, the entire thing is to convince you that you are your thoughts and that you are your body, because they can use electromagnetic warfare to control your thoughts, to control your emotions, and thus control your body.
[03:12:23.357 --> 03:12:29.442]  And that's why I say we're all a part of a massive MKUltra experiment called society, right?
[03:12:29.442 --> 03:12:35.568]  We think of all these horrific things that they did to people, but they're using all these same technologies in order to control us.
[03:12:35.568 --> 03:12:42.654]  And what really changed my life wasn't just waking up to, you know, what you've been talking about in Endgame for so many years.
[03:12:42.654 --> 03:12:48.059]  What changed my life was when I said, well, how am I hypnotized?
[03:12:49.131 --> 03:12:51.833]  And I realized I was controlled financially.
[03:12:51.833 --> 03:12:52.794]  It controlled my career.
[03:12:52.794 --> 03:12:54.635]  I didn't think I could become that successful.
[03:12:54.635 --> 03:12:57.597]  I didn't think I could achieve a lot.
[03:12:57.597 --> 03:13:01.099]  I thought I couldn't be happy because there was all these bad things happening in the world.
[03:13:01.099 --> 03:13:13.728]  And that's how this whole... If consciousness creates reality, which it does, and we know from the Azerber effect that consciousness influenced reality down to the subatomic level, and that 95% of our life is subconscious, it's a habitual pattern
[03:13:13.968 --> 03:13:17.011]  They're programming us as engines of builders.
[03:13:17.011 --> 03:13:24.400]  We're like spiritual nanotech, that if they can program us, they can use us as slaves to build their new system.
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:31.989]  So these demons, these creatures, whatever they are, are trying to enslave us to be their slaves, building whatever it is they want.
[03:13:31.989 --> 03:13:34.512]  Instead, God's saying, no, break free, be your own individual.
[03:13:35.478 --> 03:13:43.344]  And the funny thing is that actually we are the ones ultimately creating our own enslavement unconsciously.
[03:13:43.344 --> 03:13:54.312]  They're just using all this warfare in order to influence our consciousness, but we're unaware that it's taking place, so we unconsciously accept the viruses in the operating system, and then they run our operations.
[03:13:54.312 --> 03:13:55.133]  Because we're in a false reality.
[03:13:55.133 --> 03:14:01.138]  We've got to step into our office as sentient conscious beings, made in the image of God with free will, and then do what we want.
[03:14:01.838 --> 03:14:09.623]  We have to stop submitting the outside stimuli and that's what Reset Wars exposes is they've got their reset to stop us from awakening.
[03:14:09.623 --> 03:14:10.704]  This is the real reset.
[03:14:11.553 --> 03:14:13.373]  And imagine if everybody realizes that.
[03:14:13.373 --> 03:14:23.656]  Imagine if the nurse that's in the medical system that's fed up with it but thinks she's powerless realizes she can create her own private practice and it can eventually become the biggest private practice in Texas.
[03:14:23.656 --> 03:14:33.238]  Imagine if the English teacher realizes that she can create one of the most powerful schools in California and you just start going down the line.
[03:14:33.238 --> 03:14:39.420]  You realize the broadcaster that wants to be like Alex Jones and Owen can actually tap in to the same
[03:14:39.980 --> 03:14:40.620]  We're good to go.
[03:14:59.633 --> 03:15:02.415]  That's what consciousness that God gave us.
[03:15:02.415 --> 03:15:03.395]  It's art.
[03:15:03.395 --> 03:15:13.101]  God created us with free will to be able to create new ideas, create new systems, create new frontiers, and experience consciousness in the only way.
[03:15:13.101 --> 03:15:16.123]  First, Einstein said, God does not play at dice.
[03:15:16.123 --> 03:15:17.124]  Then he said, no, I'm wrong.
[03:15:17.124 --> 03:15:17.804]  God's real.
[03:15:17.804 --> 03:15:19.565]  God only plays at dice.
[03:15:19.565 --> 03:15:25.649]  God's playing dice constantly because only creating free will is new when you're omnipresent.
[03:15:25.649 --> 03:15:27.450]  What else is new when you're omnipresent?
[03:15:27.450 --> 03:15:28.551]  Creating new free will creatures.
[03:15:29.031 --> 03:15:30.472]  There's a quote by Iris Murdoch.
[03:15:30.472 --> 03:15:36.634]  She says, we live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion, and the great task in life is to find reality.
[03:15:36.634 --> 03:15:37.975]  What is real?
[03:15:37.975 --> 03:15:41.196]  Well, what is real is that consciousness creates reality.
[03:15:41.196 --> 03:15:43.597]  These people don't have any control over us.
[03:15:43.597 --> 03:15:45.458]  They're actually at a lower level of consciousness.
[03:15:45.458 --> 03:15:51.701]  And why are we following these Democratic and Republican politicians like Nadler?
[03:15:51.701 --> 03:15:53.061]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[03:15:53.061 --> 03:15:53.722]  JetWars.com.
[03:15:54.949 --> 03:16:00.192]  What if you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad?
[03:16:00.192 --> 03:16:06.236]  Wait till they've got their world ID, and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[03:16:06.236 --> 03:16:19.144]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do.
[03:16:19.144 --> 03:16:23.747]  And publicly, they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[03:16:24.087 --> 03:16:24.907]  We're good to go.
[03:16:40.373 --> 03:16:42.074]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[03:16:42.074 --> 03:16:45.577]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and others lead the charge, along with InfoWars.
[03:16:45.577 --> 03:16:46.398]  But it's not enough.
[03:16:46.398 --> 03:16:48.880]  Every individual has to not comply.
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:51.502]  We have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[03:16:51.502 --> 03:16:55.745]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.

[03:17:57.031 --> 03:18:02.538]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[03:18:02.538 --> 03:18:08.825]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[03:18:08.825 --> 03:18:14.492]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[03:18:14.492 --> 03:18:17.015]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet.
[03:18:17.655 --> 03:18:20.778]  We need you to help save InfoWars.
[03:18:20.778 --> 03:18:28.163]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[03:18:28.163 --> 03:18:32.486]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[03:18:32.486 --> 03:18:33.707]  We don't think so.
[03:18:33.707 --> 03:18:38.270]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[03:18:38.270 --> 03:18:39.151]  But we won't let them.
[03:18:39.791 --> 03:18:42.514]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[03:19:58.728 --> 03:20:01.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:08.400 --> 03:20:14.308]  Take the highway to the end of the night.
[03:20:14.308 --> 03:20:17.632]  End of the night.
[03:20:17.632 --> 03:20:19.113]  End of the night.
[03:20:19.113 --> 03:20:21.797]  Take a journey to the bright midnight.
[03:20:21.797 --> 03:20:23.839]  Take a journey to the
[03:20:26.301 --> 03:20:27.902]  Or kill the children.
[03:20:27.902 --> 03:20:30.202]  We've got ABC News reporting.
[03:20:30.202 --> 03:20:35.564]  I said last week, I said now that Fauci says we're going to inject newborns, they're claiming there's outbreaks of newborns.
[03:20:35.564 --> 03:20:36.484]  They're all dying.
[03:20:36.484 --> 03:20:39.185]  It's very easy to predict.
[03:20:39.185 --> 03:20:45.106]  Sure as the sun came up this morning, COVID-19 live updates ABC News.
[03:20:45.106 --> 03:20:49.007]  Pediatric COVID cases rise for third week.
[03:20:49.007 --> 03:20:52.308]  Babies need shots.
[03:20:52.308 --> 03:20:52.428]  And
[03:20:53.806 --> 03:20:59.732]  I've got the articles right here from all over the world where people that take the shots are double likely to die.
[03:20:59.732 --> 03:21:06.699]  Why do you think Jake Dizzy, great researcher, we'll get back into the mind control and how to counter it, they just want to kill so many people now.
[03:21:06.699 --> 03:21:11.784]  I guess they just figure statistically there's a giant awakening just to just kill them.
[03:21:11.784 --> 03:21:15.127]  But if we kill them with the military, they'll rise up and defeat us.
[03:21:15.127 --> 03:21:16.068]  We got to do it through medicine.
[03:21:16.735 --> 03:21:26.961]  Well, I mean, even Bezos had that really bizarre speech the other day, or quote the other day, when he was talking about how they're going to turn Earth into a nature preserve and everyone's going to live in space.
[03:21:26.961 --> 03:21:30.864]  I mean, they realize they don't really need most people, right?
[03:21:30.864 --> 03:21:32.384]  And that's what this is all about.
[03:21:32.384 --> 03:21:36.547]  And when we go into all these documents, it can be a little scary, right?
[03:21:36.547 --> 03:21:40.810]  It's like, oh my gosh, they have all these like psychological warfare weapons they're using on us.
[03:21:40.810 --> 03:21:42.411]  But I want to say that's why
[03:21:43.331 --> 03:21:44.912]  Alex put together Reset Wars.
[03:21:44.912 --> 03:21:48.275]  Yeah, if you're conscious of that operation, it's game over.
[03:21:48.275 --> 03:21:49.015]  Like, what does G.I.
[03:21:49.015 --> 03:21:49.616]  Joe say?
[03:21:49.616 --> 03:21:50.936]  Knowing is half the battle.
[03:21:50.936 --> 03:21:52.077]  Knowing is half the battle.
[03:21:52.077 --> 03:21:59.863]  And so, when you go to Reset Wars, this is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg, Klaus Schwab, this is exactly what they don't want us to know.
[03:21:59.863 --> 03:22:05.807]  And that's why the world's getting crazier, because they're trying to move us back into the Matrix to stop the spiritual awakening.
[03:22:06.147 --> 03:22:20.609]  So, Alex put a step-by-step guide to show you exactly how they use the warfare, how to break out of it, how to de-pattern, reprogram your mind, connect on your own, not through Alex, but connect on your own, to God, to spirit, to your higher purpose.
[03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:23.891]  Look, I've been a fan of Alex for a long time.
[03:22:23.891 --> 03:22:28.853]  I think this is better than even Endgame, the greatest work he ever did, because this is the final step.
[03:22:28.853 --> 03:22:31.434]  This is the final step for everyone to wake up.
[03:22:31.434 --> 03:22:36.536]  So, please, go to ResetWars.com and sign up right now.
[03:22:36.536 --> 03:22:49.461]  You were telling me recently, about maybe 10, 12 years ago, you were going to write a book with some big author, and when the publishing houses and CNN and everything found out, they tried to shut your book down.
[03:22:49.941 --> 03:22:53.943]  And so what we figured out is one, now you've got something even more powerful.
[03:22:53.943 --> 03:23:03.767]  This is step-by-step for you to find out how to break free from the physical and emotional planes, how to break free from the lack of purpose, how to break free from your financial health limitations.
[03:23:03.767 --> 03:23:09.129]  I'm going to cover that next segment with the quantum physics that they know of the observer effect.
[03:23:09.129 --> 03:23:11.410]  This is not like BS.
[03:23:11.410 --> 03:23:14.371]  This is scientifically backed up we're about to cover.
[03:23:14.371 --> 03:23:19.313]  Notice we've given the globals a big run for their money because I was subconsciously already using all this.
[03:23:20.633 --> 03:23:23.149]  And as a fan of your work for so long...
[03:23:24.321 --> 03:23:29.943]  The whole full circle is one, step one was you woke everybody up to the New World Order, right?
[03:23:29.943 --> 03:23:33.044]  And step number two is you woke everybody up to the Great Reset.
[03:23:33.044 --> 03:23:39.427]  Step number three is now we're waking people up to who they really are and giving reverse engineering the playbook of mind control.
[03:23:39.427 --> 03:23:41.087]  First, you got to realize you're under attack.
[03:23:41.087 --> 03:23:42.208]  You got to realize what the agenda is.
[03:23:42.208 --> 03:23:44.269]  Then you realize who you are to fix it.
[03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.649]  Exactly.
[03:23:44.649 --> 03:23:45.289]  That's how a fight is.
[03:23:45.289 --> 03:23:48.150]  Somebody comes up and for no reason, you're like, okay, I'm just getting ahead.
[03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:49.851]  Okay, I'm going to fight this.
[03:23:49.851 --> 03:23:50.391]  I'm going to win.
[03:23:50.391 --> 03:23:51.371]  I'm going to fight.
[03:23:51.371 --> 03:23:51.872]  And then that's it.
[03:23:53.251 --> 03:24:04.739]  And that's why we're saying, go right now, sign up to ResetWars.com, get on the early bird list, because once Mark Zuckerberg sees this, he's kicking Metaverse into high gear.
[03:24:04.739 --> 03:24:11.063]  He's going to be like, we must get Metaverse set up to trap people into- While we're explaining that, notice it all happens at the same time.
[03:24:11.063 --> 03:24:13.825]  We've been playing this six months.
[03:24:13.825 --> 03:24:16.207]  The Reset Wars is the answer to the Metaverse.
[03:24:16.954 --> 03:24:17.975]  Quite literally.
[03:24:17.975 --> 03:24:21.257]  Because the metaverse, all it is is a simulation within a simulation.
[03:24:21.257 --> 03:24:23.318]  We're already in a simulation.
[03:24:23.318 --> 03:24:25.880]  People go, the zombie apocalypse is coming!
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:28.042]  The zombie apocalypse is already here, and guess what?
[03:24:28.042 --> 03:24:29.743]  I'm a zombie, you're a zombie, you're a zombie.
[03:24:29.743 --> 03:24:35.847]  We're all zombies because subconscious programming controls 95% of our life, and most of us have been controlled by other people.
[03:24:35.847 --> 03:24:40.530]  So, all they're doing with the metaverse is creating another layer of a simulation within the simulation.
[03:24:40.530 --> 03:24:43.653]  And they know we know that since the big hit movie is Free Guy.
[03:24:43.653 --> 03:24:45.214]  He's the finally guy that gets it.
[03:24:45.734 --> 03:24:49.375]  But they know we have that hunger, so they want to think the system will give us that.
[03:24:49.375 --> 03:24:50.475]  Exactly.
[03:24:50.475 --> 03:24:53.336]  And to further entrap us into our emotions.
[03:24:53.336 --> 03:24:54.697]  So this is like the real free guy.
[03:24:54.697 --> 03:25:02.299]  I mean, if people are looking for a free guy, how to break your player out of the metaverse, then that's what Reset Wars is.
[03:25:02.728 --> 03:25:06.710]  And I told Alex, you know Alex, Alex just wants to do his show.
[03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:09.711]  In an ideal world, Alex wouldn't promote anything and he would just do his show.
[03:25:09.711 --> 03:25:21.777]  But I said, Alex, Reset Wars, this course is literally going to be the thing where people are going to walk up to you and cry and they're going to be like, this changed my life, I quit drinking, I broke out of my debt, slavery.
[03:25:21.777 --> 03:25:24.018]  You've already shot a bunch of people and have had huge success.
[03:25:24.438 --> 03:25:26.439]  I've had friends quit drinking from it.
[03:25:26.439 --> 03:25:34.163]  I've had a friend that's been watching you for 15 years saying he's watched thousands of episodes and it was literally the most powerful thing that he'd ever seen you put together.
[03:25:34.163 --> 03:25:38.344]  Because you never, you know this stuff, but you've never put it together in a way.
[03:25:38.344 --> 03:25:41.606]  You helped me sit down for months and write it all down.
[03:25:41.606 --> 03:25:45.348]  We met in meeting after meeting after meeting to write this out and you made me do it.
[03:25:45.348 --> 03:25:45.968]  I appreciate that.
[03:25:46.644 --> 03:26:00.089]  And so, I wanted to come on today just in honor of that because, look, I was telling Alex, I'm like, Info Wars is tomorrow's news today, but Reset Wars is tomorrow's wisdom today.
[03:26:00.089 --> 03:26:04.351]  This is historically what tyrants always try to stop
[03:26:04.691 --> 03:26:13.658]  Everybody from FindOut, so you better believe that when they actually find out that they put ResetWars together, there's a good chance that they're going to try to shut it down.
[03:26:13.658 --> 03:26:15.479]  They're going to try to shut the website down.
[03:26:15.479 --> 03:26:20.243]  That's why you got to go right now and sign up at ResetWars.com.
[03:26:20.243 --> 03:26:22.264]  Alex has it coming out in early December.
[03:26:22.264 --> 03:26:23.565]  It's going to be massive.
[03:26:23.565 --> 03:26:25.627]  And then here's the exciting thing.
[03:26:25.627 --> 03:26:26.347]  We're all energy.
[03:26:26.347 --> 03:26:27.788]  We're all electromagnetic fields.
[03:26:27.788 --> 03:26:32.412]  We're all connected to higher consciousness, and we all tap into a collective unconsciousness.
[03:26:32.412 --> 03:26:33.293]  Once you wake up,
[03:26:34.053 --> 03:26:35.894]  And you show how to break out of debt slavery?
[03:26:35.894 --> 03:26:37.235]  It's the 100th monkey effect.
[03:26:37.235 --> 03:26:38.835]  It's the 100th monkey effect.
[03:26:38.835 --> 03:26:42.717]  And so what happens is when you go, well, how do you have such a great life?
[03:26:42.717 --> 03:26:43.818]  How'd you do X, Y, and Z?
[03:26:43.818 --> 03:26:45.298]  That's why they're so panicked.
[03:26:45.298 --> 03:26:47.679]  We don't want to use this knowledge to enslave you.
[03:26:47.679 --> 03:26:51.021]  We want to use this knowledge to empower you because we're selfish.
[03:26:51.021 --> 03:26:52.542]  We want to rise with you.
[03:26:52.542 --> 03:26:53.762]  These globalists are mentally ill.
[03:26:53.762 --> 03:26:57.204]  They want to suppress you so they're on top of a sinking ship.
[03:26:57.204 --> 03:26:59.285]  No, we want to be on top of a rocket with you.
[03:27:00.470 --> 03:27:09.205]  And it's the only, we are not going to win by just yelling about in front of a, in front of a building.
[03:27:09.205 --> 03:27:11.068]  The Pilgrims had to leave the Netherlands.
[03:27:11.068 --> 03:27:12.411]  They had to build a new country.
[03:27:12.411 --> 03:27:13.593]  We've got to build the new thing.
[03:27:13.593 --> 03:27:14.114]  And this is it.
[03:27:15.325 --> 03:27:20.648]  And once everybody realizes, one by one, we go, oh my gosh, consciousness creates reality.
[03:27:20.648 --> 03:27:22.388]  I've been programmed to believe I'm not that smart.
[03:27:22.388 --> 03:27:23.329]  I can't make money.
[03:27:23.329 --> 03:27:24.689]  I'm not that good at this.
[03:27:24.689 --> 03:27:32.433]  I've been programmed through an emotional pattern that's been memorized in my brain and nervous system that I have a tendency towards depression.
[03:27:32.433 --> 03:27:36.315]  Once we break out of that entire software system and re-engineer it,
[03:27:36.835 --> 03:27:37.777]  That's when it's game over.
[03:27:37.777 --> 03:27:39.199]  That's when the entire control system falls.
[03:27:49.804 --> 03:27:54.546]  A history course maybe to do, or a cryptocurrency course, or a political course.
[03:27:54.546 --> 03:27:57.787]  And I said, no, I want to do Spirit Wars, Mind Wars.
[03:27:57.787 --> 03:28:06.890]  And I'm not taking credit away from you, but once we decided on that topic, you have been such an inspiration and more than half of what we put together.
[03:28:06.890 --> 03:28:08.170]  So Jake, great job.
[03:28:08.170 --> 03:28:12.252]  But it's just crazy that we had to argue about making the Spirit Wars, Mind Wars.
[03:28:12.252 --> 03:28:13.953]  And I was like, no, that's the first chapter.
[03:28:13.953 --> 03:28:15.013]  And now don't you see that's the key?
[03:28:15.453 --> 03:28:18.537]  Folks, I got to officially argue with Alex Jones.
[03:28:18.537 --> 03:28:19.698]  Who gets to say that?
[03:28:19.698 --> 03:28:21.260]  No, but Reset... Everybody does.
[03:28:21.260 --> 03:28:22.061]  I'm not that smart.
[03:28:22.061 --> 03:28:25.785]  The point is, the point is, is that we talked about a lot of things to help people.
[03:28:25.785 --> 03:28:29.129]  Let me say this... We got a lot of great... But if you don't get your mind free, you're done.
[03:28:29.129 --> 03:28:29.669]  Let me say this.
[03:28:30.350 --> 03:28:31.611]  You call it Reset Wars.
[03:28:31.611 --> 03:28:33.631]  Go to the website right now and sign up.
[03:28:33.631 --> 03:28:35.672]  Please go to the website and sign up.
[03:28:35.672 --> 03:28:39.694]  I'll tell you, this is the most powerful thing because this is Mind Wars and Spirit Wars.
[03:28:39.694 --> 03:28:44.076]  Because The Great Reset is about a psychological and spiritual war.
[03:28:44.076 --> 03:28:48.978]  Psychological to brainwash you, spiritual to convince you you're a physical body, cut you off from God.
[03:28:48.978 --> 03:28:53.099]  Reset Wars is a step-by-step playbook to find out, and it's coming soon.
[03:28:53.099 --> 03:28:53.820]  ResetWars.com.
[03:28:55.748 --> 03:29:01.251]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see why Alex Jones was deplatformed.
[03:29:01.251 --> 03:29:07.514]  InfoWars was right above the target, and the globalists were a year out from launching their attack.
[03:29:07.514 --> 03:29:13.197]  Three years later, and InfoWars is still thriving, thanks to the support of our audience.
[03:29:13.197 --> 03:29:15.718]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet.
[03:29:16.358 --> 03:29:19.380]  We need you to help save InfoWars.
[03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:26.783]  The enemies entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack against Alex Jones.
[03:29:26.783 --> 03:29:31.086]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial?
[03:29:31.086 --> 03:29:32.306]  We don't think so.
[03:29:32.306 --> 03:29:36.888]  They want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new U.S.S.A.
[03:29:36.888 --> 03:29:37.769]  But we won't let them.
[03:29:38.409 --> 03:29:42.554]  Alex Jones will have his day in court with your support.
[03:29:42.554 --> 03:29:49.342]  Go to SaveInfoWars.com now and give your donation to save the First Amendment.
[03:29:49.342 --> 03:29:53.006]  SaveInfoWars.com and God bless America.
[03:29:55.103 --> 03:30:02.371]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[03:30:02.371 --> 03:30:08.278]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[03:30:08.278 --> 03:30:09.700]  Horrible crashes and
[03:30:11.249 --> 03:30:13.532]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[03:30:13.532 --> 03:30:25.628]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfolwarestore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[03:30:25.628 --> 03:30:28.612]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[03:30:29.605 --> 03:30:38.272]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:30:38.272 --> 03:30:41.735]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[03:30:41.735 --> 03:30:44.617]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[03:30:44.617 --> 03:30:54.165]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[03:30:55.786 --> 03:31:17.917]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[03:31:19.164 --> 03:31:28.292]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation, it's not on the national news, and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[03:31:28.292 --> 03:31:29.253]  It's just crazy.
[03:31:29.253 --> 03:31:38.341]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines, it doesn't hurt anybody, you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[03:31:38.341 --> 03:31:39.102]  It's just crazy.
[03:31:39.682 --> 03:31:44.586]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said, these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[03:31:44.586 --> 03:31:47.608]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[03:31:47.608 --> 03:31:49.289]  That's why Infowars is on air.
[03:31:49.289 --> 03:31:52.612]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[03:31:52.612 --> 03:31:53.653]  This is just insane.
[03:31:53.653 --> 03:31:55.014]  These people are killers.
[03:31:55.014 --> 03:32:02.259]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[03:32:02.259 --> 03:32:04.221]  And look, almost all of them work.
[03:32:04.881 --> 03:32:08.163]  But they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[03:32:08.163 --> 03:32:13.426]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins in them.
[03:32:13.426 --> 03:32:25.514]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfolwarestore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[03:32:25.514 --> 03:32:28.496]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[03:32:29.505 --> 03:32:38.171]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:38.171 --> 03:32:41.634]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[03:32:41.634 --> 03:32:44.496]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[03:32:44.496 --> 03:32:49.479]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[03:32:49.479 --> 03:32:51.801]  Clean energy without the big crash.
[03:32:51.801 --> 03:32:54.042]  It's available right now and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[03:32:57.907 --> 03:33:07.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.092 --> 03:33:14.537]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.537 --> 03:33:23.482]  So we see the whole corporate media telling us we're ugly, we're depressed, we're failed, we're fallen, we're racist.
[03:33:23.482 --> 03:33:26.204]  We're here telling you you're amazing, made in the image of God.
[03:33:27.168 --> 03:33:29.869]  And you've got to simply realize the programming and transcend it.
[03:33:29.869 --> 03:33:35.951]  So yeah, we're hammering the hell out of it because under pressure, the great answers come.
[03:33:35.951 --> 03:33:39.933]  And I've knew all this my whole life, but never really consciously took it in.
[03:33:39.933 --> 03:33:42.814]  So that's why Jake is so excited about this and hammering.
[03:33:42.814 --> 03:33:45.055]  Reset wars because
[03:33:46.377 --> 03:33:48.958]  We were there six months ago thinking, how do we really help people?
[03:33:48.958 --> 03:33:50.999]  How do we do something positive?
[03:33:50.999 --> 03:33:52.160]  He's a big positive guy.
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:52.940]  So he interviewed me.
[03:33:52.940 --> 03:33:55.861]  I said, Hey, we ought to do something positive.
[03:33:55.861 --> 03:33:57.742]  He ought to went out to dinner.
[03:33:57.742 --> 03:33:59.443]  His dad came and visited some of his crew.
[03:33:59.443 --> 03:34:02.904]  I went on a show and I was like, you know, I really like what you do.
[03:34:02.904 --> 03:34:03.705]  I'm a follower of your work.
[03:34:03.705 --> 03:34:05.446]  A lot of my family are fans.
[03:34:05.446 --> 03:34:06.506]  What do we do that's positive?
[03:34:06.506 --> 03:34:10.388]  Like, well, let's do financial or let's do, and we settled on,
[03:34:12.955 --> 03:34:17.878]  Mental reset wars, spiritual reset wars, because that's the beginning of it all.
[03:34:17.878 --> 03:34:20.159]  And then we went, yeah, we have the same understanding.
[03:34:20.159 --> 03:34:22.020]  It was like it was meant to happen.
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:23.401]  God was doing it and now here we are.
[03:34:23.401 --> 03:34:34.388]  We've got a bunch of these documents to go over and a bunch of the evidence where they talk about how you got your real self, how they program your subconscious to wall off your real self and create a new subconscious.
[03:34:35.208 --> 03:34:36.309]  They call that de-pattering.
[03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:38.150]  These are MKUltra documents.
[03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:47.676]  I mean, this, because we finished the course, and then you're like, wait a minute, this is everything we independently were saying, because they already know.
[03:34:47.676 --> 03:34:55.061]  You can give it whatever name you want or label it, but every school of thought is just looking at what's actually going on and giving it its term.
[03:34:56.240 --> 03:35:04.483]  Yeah, I mean, none of this system operates, none of this slave system operates unless they keep people patterned.
[03:35:04.483 --> 03:35:11.306]  You can't have a debt-based monetary system where 80-something percent of people live their entire life in credit card debt.
[03:35:12.398 --> 03:35:16.060]  Unless you keep people from thinking they can ever wake up.
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:19.862]  Unless you keep people from realizing that they're actually more powerful.
[03:35:19.862 --> 03:35:27.586]  That just like anything else... I remember when I was 16 years old and had my first couple jobs, I would get credit cards every month.
[03:35:27.586 --> 03:35:30.588]  As soon as I got credit and didn't want debt, never get them sent.
[03:35:30.588 --> 03:35:31.849]  They were like catching me early.
[03:35:32.728 --> 03:35:45.593]  Exactly and it's not just that it's every single area is designed to make us think we're just these little bodies and we're not capable of that much and they control everything and
[03:35:48.695 --> 03:35:54.760]  Unless all of us realize that we have access to these higher levels of awareness.
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:36:00.364]  And as you talk about in the Reset Wars course, there's a term Alex uses in the course.
[03:36:00.364 --> 03:36:03.206]  It's called your emotional control grid.
[03:36:03.206 --> 03:36:07.470]  And the emotional control grid is when they literally trap us into a false identity.
[03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:20.563]  We attach to it through our nervous system over and over, so we memorize our own thoughts and feelings for so long, we think it's who we really are, we think our personality... And that's the de-patterning that's cutting us from our original program to the new program.
[03:36:21.305 --> 03:36:22.085]  Exactly.
[03:36:22.085 --> 03:36:38.510]  And they are, you know, in the deep patterning in this MKUltra document, they talk about how they have people asleep for weeks on end, and they're just filling them with millions of suggestions from affirmations, subliminals, putting them into hypnotic states.
[03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:44.412]  And then they can later, that's the joke like in the movies, like, code name Cobra Belly, and you go out and kill somebody.
[03:36:44.412 --> 03:36:45.253]  That's because that was real.
[03:36:45.253 --> 03:36:49.434]  They were programming them with a term finally to wake up once that happened and do what they're told.
[03:36:50.094 --> 03:36:50.835]  Exactly.
[03:36:50.835 --> 03:37:08.690]  And once we realize we are all a part of MKUltra on a social level, whether it's fluoride in the water, whether it's the algorithms, whether it's keeping us in a fear state, every single thing is designed to put us in a hypnotic state.
[03:37:08.690 --> 03:37:13.715]  And that's why I say brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[03:37:13.715 --> 03:37:14.055]  That's right.
[03:37:14.475 --> 03:37:25.204]  So, be aware of the programming, be aware of the systems, be calm about it, and trust God to guide you out of it, and then just realize that this stuff exists, and that's how you transcend it.
[03:37:25.204 --> 03:37:27.807]  And that's really what Reset Wars is.
[03:37:27.807 --> 03:37:30.149]  We go through examples, and the history of it, and how to do it.
[03:37:30.769 --> 03:37:41.737]  And, you know, when Alex was filming this, you know, Alex doesn't like to promote stuff, but I just think that Reset Wars is the greatest thing he ever did.
[03:37:41.737 --> 03:37:49.082]  But one of the things that I found was really interesting and why I'm saying, like, you guys, your lives are going to be changed literally by Reset Wars.
[03:37:49.082 --> 03:37:51.043]  You've never heard Alex talk like this.
[03:37:51.043 --> 03:37:53.185]  Go open a new tab right now.
[03:37:53.185 --> 03:37:56.207]  Go to ResetWars.com and sign up right now.
[03:37:56.207 --> 03:37:57.108]  Literally right now.
[03:37:57.788 --> 03:38:00.210]  Because you're going to find some amazing stuff in there.
[03:38:00.210 --> 03:38:04.813]  I had no idea that you were a kid starting your career.
[03:38:04.813 --> 03:38:10.557]  Now Alex Jones, obviously one of the most powerful broadcasters in the world, I had no idea you started in a closet.
[03:38:10.557 --> 03:38:16.602]  I had no idea that repeatedly the rug got pulled over you over and over and over again.
[03:38:16.602 --> 03:38:23.507]  And it just shows that if you understand the power of consciousness and you live from an inner vision, you can
[03:38:24.267 --> 03:38:27.531]  Not only change your personal reality, but you might be able to change the world.
[03:38:41.059 --> 03:38:59.631]  Once you realize these systems that Alex breaks down in Reset Wars, you're going to find yourself... There's a quote by Patanjali and he says, once you're inspired by some great purpose or extraordinary bond, all your barriers break their limitations and you find yourself to be a more powerful person than you ever imagined.
[03:38:59.631 --> 03:39:00.472]  Let me break that down.
[03:39:00.472 --> 03:39:05.275]  It's like people think lightning comes from the ground up or the sky down.
[03:39:05.275 --> 03:39:06.016]  It's actually ground up.
[03:39:06.949 --> 03:39:08.610]  It's an electrical connection.
[03:39:08.610 --> 03:39:15.434]  Once you have will and you reach out towards God, God's free will, God doesn't strike you with the lightning of awakening without you reaching up.
[03:39:15.434 --> 03:39:18.036]  But once you start doing it, it starts happening.
[03:39:18.036 --> 03:39:31.565]  What I'm saying is once you reach out past what CNN tells you to do and forget them and Jim Acosta and all that and Barack Obama and all these people, once you reach out of the universe to God, God's going to answer.
[03:39:32.629 --> 03:39:34.771]  And not just Barack Obama or CNN.
[03:39:34.771 --> 03:39:40.516]  Think about the idea of this Newtonian model of physics that we're still so attached to.
[03:39:40.516 --> 03:39:46.781]  This Newtonian model of physics is everything is physical in the universe and energy is this unextrainable side phenomena.
[03:39:46.781 --> 03:39:52.005]  Max Planck already showed us, he won the Nobel Prize studying atoms and he said there's no matter as such.
[03:39:52.005 --> 03:39:56.529]  Matter jumps back and forth under spectrometers into another dimension and back.
[03:39:56.529 --> 03:39:57.790]  It disappears and comes back.
[03:39:57.790 --> 03:39:58.351]  It fluxes.
[03:39:59.031 --> 03:40:12.744]  And that's why if people realize the secrets of quantum physics and how to harness the power of consciousness, we already know the observer effect shows us that subatomic particles are sometimes particles and sometimes they're waves.
[03:40:12.744 --> 03:40:15.487]  They're energy that moves into another dimension and what's everything?
[03:40:15.487 --> 03:40:17.189]  It's made up of the same energy.
[03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:19.711]  So your bank account is an observer effect.
[03:40:20.672 --> 03:40:24.934]  Thousands of people realize this and they all break out of debt servitude.
[03:40:24.934 --> 03:40:34.800]  Once thousands of people realize that they could change the health system, you can build private practices, you can change the education system, the tech system.
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:39.683]  Once people start using the power of consciousness to experiment on this reality and go,
[03:40:40.203 --> 03:40:47.325]  All of energy is affected, all of reality is affected by subatomic particles that consciousness creates reality.
[03:40:47.325 --> 03:40:56.547]  I can de-pattern myself from the world, be transformed by the renewing of your mind, and then I can use the power of consciousness to do thought experiments to start to recreate my life.
[03:40:56.547 --> 03:40:59.688]  And I think that's the next step that they don't want us to know.
[03:40:59.688 --> 03:41:03.309]  They don't want us to start to test the power of consciousness.
[03:41:03.689 --> 03:41:04.050]  I'm good.
[03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:27.766]  If people go get Reset Wars when it comes out in just a few weeks, if they research it, if they put it into function, it will change the world.
[03:41:27.766 --> 03:41:33.971]  Because this is what the globals are aware of, but they're using it against you instead of you knowing how it really works.
[03:41:33.971 --> 03:41:36.373]  And it's incredible.
[03:41:36.373 --> 03:41:41.197]  So, real quick here, Alex, as we come to the end of this segment,
[03:41:42.401 --> 03:41:46.023]  First of all, if you haven't yet, like I said, open up your browser and do this.
[03:41:46.023 --> 03:41:47.484]  You honestly will thank me later.
[03:41:47.484 --> 03:41:48.445]  You're right, Jake.
[03:41:48.445 --> 03:41:51.066]  We have to hype this up because this really is the key.
[03:41:51.066 --> 03:41:58.551]  People need to go to ResetWars.com, put in your email so you get hit with the notifications first, the videos, reports, everything when it comes out.
[03:41:58.551 --> 03:42:01.612]  Because if we don't make a big deal about this, nobody's going to care.
[03:42:01.612 --> 03:42:02.613]  This is a big deal.
[03:42:02.613 --> 03:42:04.514]  This is a serious weapon.
[03:42:04.514 --> 03:42:08.837]  Why they want to arrest us, why they want to put us in prison, because they don't want you out of the prison.
[03:42:09.477 --> 03:42:12.238]  And they think, well, we'll just threaten you with jail if you don't shut up.
[03:42:12.238 --> 03:42:13.699]  Well, we're not shutting up.
[03:42:13.699 --> 03:42:15.000]  We're not going to join you, Globalist.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:16.461]  We're going to stand against you.
[03:42:16.461 --> 03:42:18.602]  Because, look, I've got a daughter.
[03:42:18.602 --> 03:42:20.803]  She's 16, 17 months old.
[03:42:20.803 --> 03:42:26.626]  I'm concerned about what everything's happening to, but just finding out the secrets of the pharmaceutical industry isn't going to save us.
[03:42:26.926 --> 03:42:32.888]  The next step to actually defeat the Great Reset is we have to realize we are energetic spiritual beings in a physical body.
[03:42:32.888 --> 03:42:34.309]  There's no such thing as death.
[03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:35.909]  We're the imagination of ourselves.
[03:42:35.909 --> 03:42:42.952]  We're already in a simulation, but we control that reality, and that's exactly what Reset Wars is showing you.
[03:42:42.952 --> 03:42:43.692]  It's very simple.
[03:42:43.692 --> 03:42:46.373]  We are no longer NPCs.
[03:42:46.373 --> 03:42:49.855]  We are real players as Christ intended us to be.
[03:42:49.855 --> 03:42:50.255]  All right.
[03:42:50.255 --> 03:42:52.616]  Go to ResetWars.com right now.
[03:42:52.616 --> 03:42:53.036]  Sign up.

[03:43:57.133 --> 03:44:02.495]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[03:44:02.495 --> 03:44:11.898]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[03:44:12.538 --> 03:44:22.503]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:44:22.503 --> 03:44:29.267]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[03:44:29.267 --> 03:44:30.688]  But there is only two things to do.
[03:44:31.821 --> 03:44:34.964]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[03:44:34.964 --> 03:44:38.266]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[03:44:38.266 --> 03:44:43.670]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:45.512]  And so, we must prepare.
[03:44:45.512 --> 03:44:56.620]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:45:53.756 --> 03:45:54.796]  Infowarrestore.com.
[03:45:57.910 --> 03:46:12.430]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[03:46:13.270 --> 03:46:18.415]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[03:46:18.415 --> 03:46:27.304]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[03:46:27.304 --> 03:46:34.871]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[03:46:34.871 --> 03:46:35.652]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:46:36.638 --> 03:46:39.440]  We are crossing the Rubicon now.
[03:46:39.440 --> 03:46:42.703]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[03:46:42.703 --> 03:46:49.049]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[03:46:49.049 --> 03:46:51.110]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:54.693]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[03:46:54.693 --> 03:46:58.857]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[03:46:58.857 --> 03:47:01.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.810 --> 03:47:15.231]  You know, folks, I could have sold out to the globalists.
[03:47:15.231 --> 03:47:19.313]  I could have done so many deals with them to push their propaganda and made money.
[03:47:19.313 --> 03:47:23.155]  But you hear me foaming at the mouth promoting reset wars.
[03:47:23.155 --> 03:47:30.798]  It's because I know if you actually listen and watch and see what's in that, you've seen a prelude here today, this is the secrets of how it all works.
[03:47:30.798 --> 03:47:35.860]  And it's just really true that like David Icke yesterday explained, we're like Russian dolls where
[03:47:37.073 --> 03:47:54.325]  There's our larger 12th Dimension Consciousness, 11th Dimension, 10th Dimension, 9th Dimension, 8th Dimension, 7th Dimension, 6th Dimension, right down to where we are, and they're trying to suck us into a false silicon division that's like a subset of the 3rd Dimension.
[03:47:54.325 --> 03:48:00.570]  I mean, their whole thing is about, oh no, no, don't see that, don't be involved, and then I read white papers where they're admitting it?
[03:48:00.570 --> 03:48:03.492]  Because they don't want humanity to get out of their control?
[03:48:03.492 --> 03:48:05.734]  I'm sorry, I want you out of control.
[03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:09.751]  And so Satan is attacking our free will.
[03:48:09.751 --> 03:48:11.673]  Christ said you must be born again.
[03:48:11.673 --> 03:48:15.396]  And you must be aware of how you operate and who you really are.
[03:48:15.396 --> 03:48:19.459]  And that you are eternal and connected to God to be born again.
[03:48:19.459 --> 03:48:21.080]  And so that's what Reset Wars is all about.
[03:48:21.080 --> 03:48:23.542]  And everything I've done is about freeing humanity.
[03:48:23.542 --> 03:48:25.803]  Everything I've done is about fighting tyrants.
[03:48:25.803 --> 03:48:27.565]  Everything I've done is about standing against them.
[03:48:27.565 --> 03:48:28.706]  But we only got like 10 minutes left.
[03:48:29.485 --> 03:48:40.071]  Here with Jake Ducey here and so I want to continue here with some of these articles because there's so many and this one's fascinating Alex.
[03:48:40.071 --> 03:48:47.015]  So this is about being energy to affect human behavior and it says quote.
[03:48:48.157 --> 03:48:59.336]  While initial attention should be toward degradation of human performance through thermal loading and electromagnetic field effects.
[03:49:00.842 --> 03:49:01.203]  I think so.
[03:49:19.983 --> 03:49:20.443]  We're good to go.
[03:49:43.504 --> 03:49:46.145]  And they could put people into a stupor.
[03:49:46.145 --> 03:50:02.991]  And it goes on to say that many of the non-lethal weapons under consideration utilize infrared sound and electromagnetic energy, including lasers, microwave, or radio frequency radiation, or visible light pulsed at brainwave frequency.
[03:50:02.991 --> 03:50:05.391]  Welcome to the 5G world.
[03:50:05.391 --> 03:50:07.452]  It's not about controlling robots.
[03:50:07.452 --> 03:50:08.332]  That's a side issue.
[03:50:08.332 --> 03:50:09.693]  It's about controlling us.
[03:50:11.564 --> 03:50:20.453]  But if you're conscious in their own documents and are aware of it, it can actually make you get even more upset and outside their control.
[03:50:20.453 --> 03:50:22.615]  You want to submit to this or go along with this question?
[03:50:23.513 --> 03:50:28.476]  And that's why this whole battle of the Great Reset is ultimately a battle of consciousness.
[03:50:28.476 --> 03:50:35.500]  And that's why Alex said, look, if we're going to do the first part of Reset Wars, it needs to be mind wars and spirit wars.
[03:50:35.500 --> 03:50:37.141]  Because this is a mind war and a spirit war.
[03:50:37.141 --> 03:50:39.642]  It's an attack on your mind, which is what these are all about.
[03:50:39.642 --> 03:50:40.243]  You agree now, right?
[03:50:40.243 --> 03:50:41.984]  Because you've done a great job helping me research this.
[03:50:41.984 --> 03:50:43.705]  Like, that was the best course to do first.
[03:50:44.105 --> 03:50:51.811]  And I think it's the only... Look, I was depressed for a while looking at everything that's happening, especially having a baby and saying, we're screwed.
[03:50:51.811 --> 03:50:53.993]  And to be honest, I'm more optimistic than I ever was.
[03:50:53.993 --> 03:50:54.353]  I agree.
[03:50:54.353 --> 03:50:54.794]  It forced us.
[03:50:54.794 --> 03:50:55.434]  I was the same way.
[03:50:55.434 --> 03:50:56.175]  We're all together.
[03:50:56.175 --> 03:50:58.476]  Everyone's being forced into the answer.
[03:50:58.476 --> 03:50:58.597]  Yeah.
[03:50:58.597 --> 03:51:01.739]  Because the left's like, oh, Jones claims right while we take over.
[03:51:01.739 --> 03:51:02.760]  He's been given the answer.
[03:51:02.760 --> 03:51:03.641]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[03:51:04.517 --> 03:51:07.299]  And it's like, these people are such gaslighters.
[03:51:07.299 --> 03:51:09.280]  This is declassified documents.
[03:51:09.280 --> 03:51:17.205]  They talk about de-patterning somebody's mind to the extent where they were literally putting a new operating system into people's minds.
[03:51:17.205 --> 03:51:22.088]  They talk about electromagnetic frequency energy waves to influence- And we're saying what you said!
[03:51:22.688 --> 03:51:23.528]  God made us.
[03:51:23.528 --> 03:51:24.429]  We have free will.
[03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:26.309]  You're allowed to mind control yourself.
[03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:27.410]  You own your body.
[03:51:27.410 --> 03:51:28.590]  You own your soul.
[03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:29.470]  You have free will.
[03:51:29.470 --> 03:51:32.551]  Mind control yourself before somebody else does.
[03:51:32.551 --> 03:51:33.292]  Is that your quote?
[03:51:33.292 --> 03:51:34.212]  Yeah, brainwash yourself.
[03:51:34.212 --> 03:51:35.653]  I want a teacher that says that.
[03:51:35.653 --> 03:51:38.313]  Mind control yourself before somebody else does.
[03:51:38.313 --> 03:51:39.274]  That's true!
[03:51:39.274 --> 03:51:41.394]  Use your freaking free will before they do this!
[03:51:41.394 --> 03:51:42.335]  My God, that is...
[03:51:43.390 --> 03:51:44.831]  Jake, that is so powerful.
[03:51:44.831 --> 03:51:47.952]  I said brainwash yourself before the world brainwashes you.
[03:51:47.952 --> 03:51:51.013]  And I thought I was, like, awake.
[03:51:51.013 --> 03:51:56.054]  And then I realized, while I knew all this stuff... Wasn't it crazy how we started doing research for this?
[03:51:56.054 --> 03:51:58.595]  And then it was like, was it going to be on, like, a financial thing?
[03:51:58.595 --> 03:52:00.756]  Or like a survival video?
[03:52:00.756 --> 03:52:01.636]  It turned into this.
[03:52:01.636 --> 03:52:02.977]  Well, that was the Holy Spirit.
[03:52:02.977 --> 03:52:03.197]  Yeah.
[03:52:03.905 --> 03:52:09.631]  Yeah, because, look, the reason I'm so optimistic now is because this is the secret.
[03:52:09.631 --> 03:52:14.997]  It's not a coincidence that the metaverse came out, like, right when we were about to publish this stuff.
[03:52:14.997 --> 03:52:19.903]  They don't want you to be renewed by the transforming of your mind.
[03:52:19.903 --> 03:52:22.806]  You're not in his artificial reality, you make reality.
[03:52:23.126 --> 03:52:23.806]  Literally.
[03:52:23.806 --> 03:52:25.667]  We're already in a simulation.
[03:52:25.667 --> 03:52:33.270]  Once we understand, this is the most fascinating stuff of all, once we understand, we create reality, they do not control us.
[03:52:33.270 --> 03:52:38.012]  But the whole way this works is through predictive programming and unconscious collective hypnosis.
[03:52:38.012 --> 03:52:50.457]  Give us to surrender our free will, get us to feel helpless, and if subatomic particles that create all reality are influenced by consciousness, we are creating our own enslavement by saying, we're screwed, we can't do it, Klaus Schwab's controlling us.
[03:52:50.457 --> 03:52:52.798]  So that's why I'm saying, open up your browser.
[03:52:53.339 --> 03:52:54.982]  No, I agree.
[03:52:54.982 --> 03:52:56.965]  Don't just give Klaus Schwab the power.
[03:52:56.965 --> 03:53:01.153]  Open up your browser to God and say, God, I want to help surviving this.
[03:53:01.153 --> 03:53:03.297]  And not just surviving, but thriving during this.
[03:53:03.297 --> 03:53:04.519]  We didn't get to all these tacks.
[03:53:04.519 --> 03:53:04.760]  Hold on.
[03:53:05.618 --> 03:53:15.324]  I mean, well this one's crazy right here, and I was going to say open up your browser and go to resetwars.com, but open up your browser and go to, God, it might even be better, but check this one out.
[03:53:15.324 --> 03:53:17.005]  This is U.S.
[03:53:17.005 --> 03:53:21.567]  Patent number 5159703, Silent Subliminal Presentation System, dated October 27, 1992.
[03:53:21.567 --> 03:53:23.929]  Quote, a silent communication system
[03:53:29.992 --> 03:53:51.649]  In which non-oral carriers in the very low or very high audio frequency range or in the adjacent ultrasonic frequency spectrum and it goes on to say that all of this is for the inducement into the brain typically through loudspeakers, earphones, on and on and on.
[03:53:51.649 --> 03:53:53.310]  What is this designed to do?
[03:53:53.310 --> 03:53:55.752]  It's literally designed, it says right here,
[03:53:56.912 --> 03:54:02.118]  Using supercomputers to analyze human emotional EEG patterns.
[03:54:02.118 --> 03:54:16.913]  They're replicating human brainwave patterns so they can get direct access into the human electrical field by mirroring the same exact electromagnetic frequency patterns of the human brain.
[03:54:17.173 --> 03:54:25.057]  That's why, even if you think you know what's going on, you watch InfoWars every day, we are still under mind control, and this is why I'm beating at the drum.
[03:54:25.057 --> 03:54:31.080]  To open your web browser, go to ResetWars.com, sign up right now, because this is how we win.
[03:54:31.080 --> 03:54:41.525]  Well, this is literally how people break free, and we're going to do this on air, we're going to break it down everywhere, but that's what this is, and they admit with the fluctuations of the music, the concerts, it's all a test.
[03:54:42.185 --> 03:54:47.907]  Try to put you in a trance, and it feels really good when they're putting you in a trance, but folks, it is total control.
[03:54:47.907 --> 03:54:54.329]  You know, you're supposed to leave today and fly back to your family on Thanksgiving, but we didn't get to the documents, Jake.
[03:54:54.329 --> 03:54:57.229]  Well, we have so many of them, I mean, it could take us 15 hours.
[03:54:57.229 --> 03:55:01.911]  No, but I mean, this is the admissions of, what's crazy is they're in the news admitting it.
[03:55:01.911 --> 03:55:05.852]  Why do you think they metaphysically admit they're doing all this to everybody?
[03:55:06.741 --> 03:55:15.911]  Um, I think that there's something weird with Black Magic in that they leave the clues.
[03:55:15.911 --> 03:55:18.193]  The same thing they did with Event 201, right?
[03:55:18.193 --> 03:55:23.579]  It's like they published Event 201, Bill Gates goes on now and he says, beware of the next smallpox.
[03:55:24.722 --> 03:55:30.546]  And, or maybe it's their own stupidity and it's God making sure... No, it's a rule.
[03:55:30.546 --> 03:55:33.749]  You have to publish when you're going to demolish a building or take property.
[03:55:33.749 --> 03:55:35.050]  You got to publish it in the newspaper.
[03:55:35.050 --> 03:55:36.551]  It's a galactic rule.
[03:55:36.551 --> 03:55:39.413]  They've got to tell you what they're about to do.
[03:55:39.413 --> 03:55:45.898]  But the funny thing is, all it takes, they didn't think Alex would ever stop and put something like this together.
[03:55:45.898 --> 03:55:47.699]  They're just trying to attack him so much.
[03:55:47.699 --> 03:55:52.303]  Well, they thought they'd attack us to keep us all balanced from where we were already going.
[03:55:52.303 --> 03:55:53.764]  They just made us get there quicker.
[03:55:54.616 --> 03:55:55.658]  Exactly.
[03:55:55.658 --> 03:55:57.081]  And I mean, this is what...
[03:56:06.135 --> 03:56:08.696]  And that's why I feel so inspired.
[03:56:08.696 --> 03:56:19.060]  If you're watching this right now and you don't feel that optimistic, you feel angry, you feel afraid, you feel doubtful that we're going to win, just remember who you are.
[03:56:19.060 --> 03:56:21.100]  You're a spiritual being in a physical body.
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:22.961]  Your body is a rental car.
[03:56:22.961 --> 03:56:25.162]  It's literally a rental car for your soul.
[03:56:25.982 --> 03:56:39.869]  Energy is never created or destroyed and when all of us start to wake up and you go to ResetWars.com right now, open up your browser and sign up and we start being renewed by the transforming of our mind, we will realize we create reality.
[03:56:39.869 --> 03:56:42.691]  They do not control us and they cannot win.
[03:56:42.691 --> 03:56:51.015]  That's why we called it Reset Wars because this is the war and we are going to win because this is a battle of consciousness.
[03:56:51.015 --> 03:56:54.757]  Bill Gates, these individuals are very low level creatures of consciousness.
[03:56:55.137 --> 03:57:05.144]  They're totally disconnected from their spiritual self, and that's why the whole psychological warfare is to trap you back into the emotional control grid, which is a term that Alex coined in the course.
[03:57:05.144 --> 03:57:06.765]  The emotional control grid.
[03:57:06.765 --> 03:57:14.270]  But the thing they fear most is that we invite God, we invite spirit into our lives, and we have access to higher power.
[03:57:14.270 --> 03:57:14.890]  That's right.
[03:57:14.890 --> 03:57:20.794]  Jake Ducey, we're going to be breaking it all down a lot more in the future at ResetWorks.com.
[03:57:20.794 --> 03:57:21.955]  I was going to release it December 7th.
[03:57:21.955 --> 03:57:23.096]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:57:23.096 --> 03:57:23.937]  When should we release this?
[03:57:23.937 --> 03:57:24.357]  What do you think?
[03:57:24.636 --> 03:57:27.918]  We got this coming out very, very, very soon.
[03:57:27.918 --> 03:57:32.020]  Look, I'm just as big of a fan of InfoWars and Alex as you are.
[03:57:32.020 --> 03:57:34.541]  I have to say, this is the greatest thing he's ever created.
[03:57:34.541 --> 03:57:36.502]  It's coming sooner than you think.
[03:57:36.502 --> 03:57:38.003]  Open up your browser.
[03:57:38.003 --> 03:57:39.703]  Show Alex right now how much you care about this.
[03:57:39.703 --> 03:57:40.224]  I know you're excited.
[03:57:40.224 --> 03:57:40.564]  They are.
[03:57:40.564 --> 03:57:40.964]  They are.
[03:57:40.964 --> 03:57:42.465]  Folks, whatever you do, share this information.
[03:57:42.465 --> 03:57:44.406]  War Room coming up.
[03:57:44.406 --> 03:57:46.707]  For a fraction... I know you're humble.
[03:57:46.707 --> 03:57:48.368]  I know you're like me.
[03:57:48.368 --> 03:57:52.510]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate, or meditate,
[03:57:53.638 --> 03:58:01.226]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[03:58:01.226 --> 03:58:03.008]  And now as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[03:58:07.287 --> 03:58:08.247]  It begins to dawn.
[03:58:08.247 --> 03:58:14.630]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are, that you be more active than you've ever been.
[03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:16.851]  The tip of the spear is Bandai-Military.
[03:58:16.851 --> 03:58:21.013]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is M4Wars.com.
[03:58:21.013 --> 03:58:25.654]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[03:58:25.654 --> 03:58:30.496]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:58:30.496 --> 03:58:31.657]  That's SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:58:32.137 --> 03:58:37.699]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[03:58:37.699 --> 03:58:49.662]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[03:59:01.653 --> 03:59:07.219]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[03:59:07.219 --> 03:59:09.982]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[03:59:09.982 --> 03:59:16.849]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[03:59:16.849 --> 03:59:18.911]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[03:59:18.911 --> 03:59:20.914]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[03:59:21.694 --> 03:59:28.276]  ...is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[03:59:28.276 --> 03:59:31.337]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[03:59:31.337 --> 03:59:34.738]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[03:59:34.738 --> 03:59:42.020]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[03:59:42.020 --> 03:59:43.801]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[03:59:48.508 --> 03:59:52.448]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
