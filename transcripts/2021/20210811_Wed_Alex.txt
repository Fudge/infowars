[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:06.371]  The military coming out and saying, OK, we need to have objections for medical reasons and others.
[00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:08.352]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.773]  Because Congress is like, hey, you can't do that.
[00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:11.913]  That's illegal, which it is.
[00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:14.894]  All of this, an experimental vaccine, that's illegal.
[00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:16.995]  But they're tricking us to do it.
[00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:19.156]  Now they're trying to bully us.
[00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:24.418]  It's just pushing, pushing, pushing, and now calling children murderers if they don't wear a mask.
[00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.653]  They want to see if you'll let convicted pedophiles come out directly in story time.
[00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:31.734]  They want to see if they can call your children murderers.
[00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:34.075]  They want to see if they can close the churches.
[00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.075]  They want to see what they can get away with.
[00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:47.720]  They want to trample you and train you and break you and condition you to be happy to go outside and show them a phone with a scanner so you can even go eat food someplace or have a job.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.720]  They want you on your knees.
[00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.582]  Do you think you're going to be safer on your knees to these people?
[00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.791]  Or are you going to be in a better place saying no to them now?
[00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:05.353]  That's the question I'm asking you now.
[00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:10.336]  Living on your knees is the most dangerous place to be.
[00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.417]  I choose, on my feet, in attack.
[00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:19.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:25.465]  A clear message that is coming through.
[00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.427]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:35.671]  Scientific evidence, experts say, proves fully vaccinated people are protected in two ways.
[00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:41.294]  Essentially, vaccines block you from getting and giving the virus.
[00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:42.474]  I want to be clear.
[00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:47.097]  While vaccinated people can spread the virus if they get a breakthrough infection,
[00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:58.747]  The fact that vaccinated people who do have a breakthrough infection are clearly capable of transmitting the infection to an uninfected person.
[00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:02.411]  Why are the doctors not here in the briefing room to take our questions?
[00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:03.792]  You know what, Kelly?
[00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:09.357]  I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to us yesterday.
[00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:13.818]  He gave a more than 30 minute speech about where we are as a country.
[00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:16.378]  I mean, he is a trusted voice.
[00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:18.819]  He's the leader of our country.
[00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.619]  No, but we heard from him, right?
[00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.159]  We heard from the president yesterday.
[00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.480]  We heard from the president about the Delta variant and vaccinations in general.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.741]  We have roughly 350 million people vaccinated in the United States.
[00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.102]  I'm actually quite proud
[00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:48.323]  Of the medical services from Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia.
[00:02:49.751 --> 00:03:00.837]  The vast majority of the people speaking up who are doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses are saying the vaccines don't work and are killing most people, and the statistics show that.
[00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:10.182]  I'm a Mayo Clinic-trained, board-certified pathologist, board-certified in anatomic and clinical pathology, so yes, I have expertise in immunology and virology.
[00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:11.783]  This is where we are right now.
[00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:13.704]  So does that look like a pandemic?
[00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:14.344]  It was.
[00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:15.545]  It's not anymore.
[00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:17.226]  We are in an endemic now.
[00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:20.387]  Statistically, the pandemic is over in Idaho.
[00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:25.770]  Statistically, once we're below a set percentage, we are not in a pandemic right now.
[00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.111]  Is the disease present?
[00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:27.691]  Sure it is.
[00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:28.652]  Is it widespread?
[00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:29.052]  No.
[00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:31.453]  We're still doing maybe 500 to 600 patient tests a day.
[00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:35.656]  At most, we're seeing 2% per day right now.
[00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:38.238]  And so, the numbers are going way down.
[00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:42.122]  The numbers are still high in a few states, but we're getting past that point.
[00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:43.102]  And here's why.
[00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.724]  Coronaviruses are seasonal.
[00:03:44.944 --> 00:03:50.609]  They follow a 6-9 month life cycle, and no matter what we do, they're going to do what they do, and then they're going to fade.
[00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:51.950]  What happened to SARS?
[00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.871]  What happened to MERS?
[00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:54.612]  What did we do to stop them?
[00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:55.293]  Nothing.
[00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:56.534]  They did their thing.
[00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:00.856]  Average COVID-19 death age 78.6.
[00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:03.757]  Average age of death in North America every year 78.6.
[00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.079]  What are our highest risk factors?
[00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.561]  Obesity, low vitamin D levels, advanced age.
[00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.743]  90% of deaths in the state have been over 70 years of age.
[00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:17.825]  That's the at-risk population.
[00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:23.269]  We have stopped our society for something that's taking people that are already at that death risk age anyway.
[00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.210]  The virus is fragile.
[00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.351]  These are just little tidbits.
[00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:26.931]  It's fragile.
[00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:28.232]  It doesn't live outside.
[00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:31.034]  UV light fractionates it, kills it, blows it apart.
[00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:33.496]  Ventilation in the wind blows it away.
[00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:35.898]  It is insanity to wear a mask outside.
[00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:39.080]  It is absolute insanity.
[00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:41.424]  And that's science.
[00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:42.445]  That's science.
[00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:47.151]  There is not one study that has shown any super spreader event to have occurred outside.
[00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:49.635]  They have all been indoors with poor ventilation.
[00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.798]  I just think that we're kidding ourselves.
[00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:55.483]  If we think kids wearing masks helps, it probably even makes it worse.
[00:04:55.663 --> 00:05:04.029]  You should also know that no vaccine, even the ones I support and would give to myself and my children, ever stops infection.
[00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.711]  In 2014, there was outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League.
[00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:11.475]  The only people who came down with symptoms were the people who were unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status.
[00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:13.496]  Boy, that sounds like a great argument for vaccines.
[00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.217]  But a question you should ask yourself.
[00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:23.604]  Knowing that half of the people who came down with symptomatic disease had no contact with an unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status individual,
[00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.825]  Where did they get the disease?
[00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:29.566]  And the answer was, from the vaccinated individuals.
[00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:32.627]  No vaccine prevents you from getting infection.
[00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:35.187]  You get infected, you shed pathogen.
[00:05:35.348 --> 00:05:37.928]  This is especially true of viral respiratory pathogens.
[00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:40.089]  You just don't get symptomatic from it.
[00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.171]  So you cannot stop spread, you cannot make these numbers that you've planned on get better by doing any of the things you're doing.
[00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:49.527]  Because that is the nature of viral respiratory pathogens.
[00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:54.370]  And you can't prevent it with a vaccine, because they don't do the very thing you're wanting them to do.
[00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.971]  But just imagine, you say, where are the scientists?
[00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.012]  Wouldn't they speak up?
[00:05:58.052 --> 00:06:00.273]  They all speak up, and they get silenced.
[00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:02.775]  Or, the head?
[00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:07.458]  Three scientists came up with the world government plan that we're now under.
[00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:15.263]  One of them's Paul Ehrlich, and his organization, his society that wants depopulation, is saying, don't worry about all those dead people.
[00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:22.450]  It'd be like if somebody said, there's been Nazi murders in Germany, and they went, well, Hitler says it's not happening.
[00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:36.881]  First, I want to play the puppet-in-chief in a press conference yesterday saying he may announce nationwide mandates for masks, and yes, lockdowns of non-essential businesses.
[00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:38.743]  Now, they've had the speech ready for weeks.
[00:06:39.263 --> 00:06:41.705]  They were talking about this day.
[00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.631]  August 11th being when it would happen.
[00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:51.555]  When I brought that up last week, I said us bringing it up may make them move the date or they may change it on their own accord.
[00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:59.800]  But I stand by my sources and Jack Posobiec's sources that they were looking at today as the day to announce new nationwide mandates.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.923]  And last night, Biden said he's looking at the law, which he always says before he does it, when he violates the law.
[00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.225]  And that would violate federalism.
[00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:09.626]  It would violate the
[00:07:10.586 --> 00:07:14.709]  Different areas of the Constitution that separate the states from the federal government.
[00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:17.170]  And so it's quite the draconian mandate.
[00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:24.075]  But he's definitely lined up and ready to do it, which will again fulfill another one of our predictions as accurate.
[00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:28.898]  I would love to be proven wrong by putting pressure on them and not having them do it.
[00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:38.204]  But I think you can bet your bottom dollar at this point they're going to move forward with lockdowns because it is, after all, the permanent emergency that Klaus Schwab and the UN and Bill Gates want.
[00:07:38.744 --> 00:07:40.125]  It is the Great Reset.
[00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:41.847]  Here is the Puppet in Chief.
[00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:46.910]  The things that I find a little disingenuous.
[00:07:48.331 --> 00:08:05.144]  When I suggest that people in zones where there is a high risk wear the mask like you all are doing, I'm told that government should get out of the way and not do that.
[00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.345]  They don't have the authority to do that.
[00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:34.479]  And I find it interesting that some of the very people who are saying that, who hold government positions, are people who are threatening that if a school teacher asks a student if they've been vaccinated, or if a principal says that everyone in my school should wear a mask or the school board votes for it, that governor will nullify that.
[00:08:36.055 --> 00:08:38.456]  That governor has the authority to say you can't do that.
[00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:43.399]  I find that totally counterintuitive and quite frankly, disingenuous.
[00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:48.882]  Do you have presidential powers to intervene in states like Texas and Florida where they are banning mask mandates?
[00:08:49.903 --> 00:08:52.384]  I don't believe that I do thus far.
[00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:53.184]  We're checking that.
[00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:00.180]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:03.543]  They're gearing up, they're getting ready to do it, whether it's today or next week.
[00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:08.267]  We've put major pressure on them because their program of enslavement's not going well.
[00:09:08.427 --> 00:09:22.839]  And speaking of masks, the M95, the supposedly best mask you can get to stop viruses and other particulate getting through into your nasal cavity or into your throat and your lungs, says on the back, this product is
[00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:25.162]  An ear loop mask.
[00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:37.656]  This product is not a respirator and will not provide any, any, any, any protection against COVID-19 coronavirus or other viruses or contaminants.
[00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:38.937]  Let me read that again.
[00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:41.240]  This product is an ear loop mask.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.121]  This product is not
[00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:52.919]  Not a respirator and will not provide any protection against COVID-19 coronavirus or other viruses or contaminants.
[00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:54.521]  Let's just read it one more time.
[00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:56.463]  This product is an ear loop mask.
[00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:03.470]  This product is not, not, not a respirator and will not, not, not, not, not, not, not, not,
[00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:04.952]  I'm not trying to be obnoxious here.
[00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:05.912]  You can go, we did it, to the local
[00:10:27.847 --> 00:10:34.351]  Walgreens, or CBS, or Walmart, and you can go in and find boxes of them and they say the same damn thing on them!
[00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:45.377]  Because, see, they'd have liability for unfair trade practices and fake advertising, false advertising, under federal and state law if they did that.
[00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:55.803]  You got all the studies and all the tests, people smoking and blowing smoke out of them, and in particular, smoke's bigger than the coronavirus.
[00:10:56.687 --> 00:11:12.790]  And it's been likened to, you can fly three, four, five, depending on the mask, 747s through the holes in the mask with a 747 being the size of the virus, much bigger than the virus per capita.
[00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.030]  So why is all that important?
[00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.891]  Because there's a war on logic, a war on reality, a war on science, a war on common sense.
[00:11:19.911 --> 00:11:21.271]  I'm going to cover next segment.
[00:11:23.252 --> 00:11:23.812]  Rand Paul,
[00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:27.950]  Came out and he's given several speeches on this now yesterday.
[00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:34.636]  Senate testimony has been censored in Senate hearings with medical experts.
[00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:36.258]  C-SPAN.
[00:11:38.139 --> 00:11:41.883]  His speeches have been censored on the floor and his speeches on Newsmax.
[00:11:43.264 --> 00:11:49.029]  And now his response to the censorship got censored and his account
[00:11:51.007 --> 00:12:01.291]  Has been frozen for seven days, and if he uploads anything else saying mask are worthless or mask don't work, he will be terminated off of YouTube.
[00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:03.332]  And you know all the rest of Big Tech will follow.
[00:12:03.532 --> 00:12:05.213]  He'll be unpersoned like President Trump.
[00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:17.018]  And the Congress sits there and takes it when they're acting beyond being a publisher following the directives of a foreign multinational corporate conglomerate called the UN and the W...
[00:12:18.198 --> 00:12:18.498]  H.O.
[00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:20.499]  run by Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:28.724]  The CDC is a non-governmental, quasi-governmental creation as well that says, oh, no one has to pay their rent anymore.
[00:12:28.944 --> 00:12:31.846]  Oh, we're going to federalize everything and put people in work camps.
[00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.427]  I've got the damn battle plan right here.
[00:12:34.447 --> 00:12:37.569]  Oh, and I got more on that, by the way, today.
[00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:39.630]  It's called a power grab.
[00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.711]  People say, well, you can't do that.
[00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:43.152]  Well, if we sit there and take it, they can do it.
[00:12:45.353 --> 00:12:46.654]  Now, you understand that
[00:12:49.112 --> 00:12:50.233]  People should demonstrate this again.
[00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:57.495]  Senator Paul ought to get up with a box of M95 masks, point out that they're the best mask a consumer can buy.
[00:12:57.515 --> 00:12:59.815]  The one we're supposed to wear.
[00:13:00.215 --> 00:13:03.736]  You know, the politicians all wear these cloth ones because you can't breathe through an M95.
[00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:04.737]  I don't blame them.
[00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:06.397]  So it's total kabuki theater.
[00:13:06.897 --> 00:13:10.218]  With an M95, it's even more ridiculous with a cloth mask.
[00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.080]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:13:16.886 --> 00:13:20.428]  You know, there's one way to make a mask actually work, but only for about 20 seconds.
[00:13:21.148 --> 00:13:22.269]  You gotta soak it in water.
[00:13:22.789 --> 00:13:29.053]  And that's if you gotta go into a burning house to get your kid or whatever, you get a wet rag, put it over your face, and it'll work for a little while through smoke.
[00:13:29.493 --> 00:13:30.533]  You better have goggles on.
[00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:31.954]  And don't try that at home, folks.
[00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:32.875]  You'll die, probably.
[00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:34.816]  But there's one way to make cloth work.
[00:13:35.456 --> 00:13:36.136]  Soak it in water.
[00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:37.697]  And again, doesn't work very long.
[00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:41.119]  Nothing works.
[00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:42.260]  It's all a lie.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.542]  It's like giving somebody a Band-Aid for a gunshot wound.
[00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:46.042]  It is
[00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:49.014]  Ridiculous.
[00:13:50.336 --> 00:13:52.539]  It's like chopping somebody's head off and giving them an aspirin.
[00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.441]  It's ridiculous.
[00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:55.202]  It's redundant.
[00:13:55.563 --> 00:14:00.590]  But we are relegated, segregated, imprisoned in
[00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:06.819]  The phantom zone here of InfoWars.com and Bandai Video.
[00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:09.380]  And we're kicking ass thanks to you reaching millions of people a day.
[00:14:10.121 --> 00:14:13.984]  But if we were allowed out on the playing field of ideas, we would have hundreds of millions a day.
[00:14:14.264 --> 00:14:15.125]  Fauci would be in jail.
[00:14:15.165 --> 00:14:16.006]  Bill Gates would be in jail.
[00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:17.146]  Klaus Schwab would be in jail.
[00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:18.107]  They would never have done this.
[00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:23.251]  But they took over the internet when they launched all this with the internet kill switch selectively enforced.
[00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:26.234]  And now they're blocking governors having hearings.
[00:14:26.974 --> 00:14:28.255]  And Senators having hearings.
[00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:31.578]  And Governors giving speeches.
[00:14:31.978 --> 00:14:32.839]  And it's criminal!
[00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:45.229]  So if we let the UN and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Big Tech do this to us while Larry Page is living on his private island in Fiji and Sergey Brin, then we deserve it!
[00:14:47.594 --> 00:14:48.174]  Seriously?
[00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:55.879]  And now they're coming for our children with TV ads all over the news saying, oh, soon it'll be approved for children.
[00:14:56.459 --> 00:14:59.140]  Children, and that's approved for emergency use.
[00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:05.444]  And now they're going to kill our kids and maim our children and we'll bury them and put up with that.
[00:15:05.644 --> 00:15:10.567]  Human sacrifice to show our fealty to the Democratic Party and the Socialists and the Chai Kongs.
[00:15:12.253 --> 00:15:17.617]  Even in Communist China, they don't censor a member of the Politburo when they're on TV, unless they go and arrest them.
[00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:20.139]  But here they do.
[00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:24.342]  So we're only one inch away from them just coming for our guns and everything else.
[00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.502]  They've set the whole thing up.
[00:15:25.903 --> 00:15:30.746]  You got Democrats taking their kids in to sign them up for studies to be injected with it.
[00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:35.149]  I mean, you hear about lab rats and stuff that Fauci tests on, but that's okay.
[00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.150]  He's got kids now.
[00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.532]  The whole public's being guinea pig tested on.
[00:15:40.453 --> 00:15:42.795]  In this new form of human sacrifice of our children.
[00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:46.318]  History is repeating itself yet again.
[00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:50.722]  We'll play the censored Rand Paul speech on the other side.
[00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.544]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:54.325]  Only you, the listeners, have done this.
[00:15:54.666 --> 00:15:55.346]  I salute you.
[00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.109]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.572]  Really appreciate you all tuning in today.
[00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:07.037]  So, one of the hundreds of things that the WTO
[00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:30.201]  And the WHO and the United Nations that control our country won't let our elected leaders say over the main communication system and won't let citizens take clips of and repeat, talk about election meddling, policy meddling, talk about mafia bullying tactics, is that masks do not protect you.
[00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:34.583]  They do zero, zero, zero.
[00:16:36.377 --> 00:16:41.319]  To protect the person wearing them from outside groups.
[00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:48.902]  They do, depending on the mask, 10, 20, 30% on stopping if you are infected.
[00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:59.486]  And that's why Senator Paul, who's a medical doctor, said, if you're sick, you should stay away from people.
[00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:04.088]  And yes, if you have to wear an M95 mask, it does something.
[00:17:05.563 --> 00:17:15.676]  But the claim that it keeps children safe and that people that aren't sick should wear it is preposterous and is a sign of control and subservience.
[00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:20.302]  And look at all these articles.
[00:17:21.283 --> 00:17:23.747]  WUSATV, Channel 9, they've all done it.
[00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:26.122]  Verified fact check.
[00:17:26.222 --> 00:17:30.286]  Why a FaceMax box says it provides no protection to the wearer.
[00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:37.553]  You try to put this out on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, any of them, Apple, they won't let you put these articles out.
[00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:38.815]  Local news, national news.
[00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:41.217]  And again, that's not just censorship.
[00:17:41.577 --> 00:17:46.122]  That's cartels of big media who admittedly get together and meet.
[00:17:46.142 --> 00:17:49.205]  I just met a few weeks ago up in Idaho.
[00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:54.538]  And they decide what the new things are, you can't say.
[00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:56.238]  You can't criticize the open border.
[00:17:56.498 --> 00:17:57.959]  You can't criticize gun control.
[00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:00.279]  You can't criticize drag queen story time.
[00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.340]  You can't criticize the UN.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.320]  You can't criticize George Soros.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.501]  You can't say the lockdown shouldn't happen.
[00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:09.822]  You can't criticize anything they want.
[00:18:13.663 --> 00:18:14.543]  That is a giant
[00:18:16.027 --> 00:18:18.648]  Cartel agenda of fear.
[00:18:19.429 --> 00:18:22.130]  And now they're selling all the baby toys with masks on it.
[00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.452]  This is a permanent thing that you're a patient.
[00:18:24.752 --> 00:18:25.432]  You're sick.
[00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:26.473]  You're dirty.
[00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:27.573]  You're bad.
[00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:28.974]  You're a bad person.
[00:18:29.254 --> 00:18:33.937]  And all these major psychological groups have come out and said this is causing massive suicide, massive...
[00:18:34.557 --> 00:18:41.444]  Problems with depressing children, screwing them up, making them think they're bad, making them live in fear, and of course, that's the plan!
[00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:46.649]  And we sit here, and we take it from the corrupt teachers' unions, and the big banks, and all of it.
[00:18:51.373 --> 00:18:58.861]  Surgeon General warns the public, stop buying face masks, says they don't work, which was true back in February of last year, but you can't say it now.
[00:19:01.328 --> 00:19:02.069]  See how that works?
[00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:06.352]  So here, ladies and gentlemen, is the censored part of the Newsmax video.
[00:19:06.913 --> 00:19:12.537]  They also, according to Senator Paul, censored one of his Senate floor speeches where he said it as well.
[00:19:12.577 --> 00:19:13.318]  That's been taken down.
[00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:20.024]  And so, jamming America's communications, that's what these criminal groups are doing while they help China oppress their own population.
[00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:22.786]  And countless other authoritarian countries.
[00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:28.471]  And then we'll see the response video that the Senator put out, which has now also been removed and had his account
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.001]  Suspended.
[00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:31.902]  Next it'll be terminated, he's been told.
[00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:33.504]  Here it is.
[00:19:33.664 --> 00:19:42.532]  He said in emails in last spring that most of the masks you can get over the counter don't work because the virus particles are too small and go right through them.
[00:19:42.572 --> 00:19:43.272]  That's still true.
[00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:44.233]  They don't work.
[00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:45.394]  There's no value.
[00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:50.378]  And yet we're mandating them by law because, and this is where I really have a disagreement with Fauci.
[00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.982]  One, he's not telling the truth, but he's promulgating bad science.
[00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:55.223]  There's pseudoscience.
[00:19:55.603 --> 00:20:04.169]  So your eighth graders running the half mile or the mile outside wearing a mask is probably going to not be good for their health.
[00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:05.330]  It's not comfortable.
[00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.652]  And there's no science to say you're preventing disease.
[00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:10.474]  It's really just a disservice to the public.
[00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:18.660]  The main thing about the mask, when he said they didn't work at all, was he didn't want people buying the N95 masks and people in the hospital, the doctors not having enough.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.683]  So he just admits that he lied, but it was a lie for our own good, supposedly.
[00:20:24.482 --> 00:20:26.023]  Now that's what got censored.
[00:20:26.584 --> 00:20:28.085]  All true, all completely true.
[00:20:28.585 --> 00:20:31.328]  Here's his response video, again, also taken down to the Thought Police.
[00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:35.631]  Recently, I shared a video on my YouTube page.
[00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:43.357]  It was an interview between myself and a journalist where we discussed a variety of topics, including the science behind wearing masks.
[00:20:44.058 --> 00:20:50.223]  Apparently, because I dared to contradict Dr. Fauci and the government, YouTube has removed my video.
[00:20:50.764 --> 00:20:53.085]  If you want to see the video, it's up on Rumble.com.
[00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.268]  Rumble.com does not censor the news.
[00:20:56.928 --> 00:21:06.075]  YouTube said the video violated their policy because of my comments on masks and that they don't allow videos that contradict government's guidance on COVID.
[00:21:06.736 --> 00:21:15.302]  YouTube may be a private entity, but they're acting like an arm of the government, censoring those who present an alternative view to the science deniers in Washington.
[00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:20.627]  People like Dr. Fauci, who have lied to the American people time and time again about masks.
[00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:21.787]  Here's the thing.
[00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:24.949]  What I said in that video is actual science.
[00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:27.750]  Most of the masks you get over the counter don't work.
[00:21:28.191 --> 00:21:29.451]  They don't prevent infection.
[00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:39.416]  Saying cloth masks work when they don't actually risks lives, as someone may choose to care for a loved one with COVID while only wearing a cloth mask.
[00:21:39.796 --> 00:21:44.178]  This is not only bad advice, but also potentially deadly misinformation.
[00:21:44.718 --> 00:21:48.179]  What I said in the interview that YouTube censored is the truth.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.020]  It's fact.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.683]  If you want to hear exactly what I said, go ahead and check out the video on my Rumble channel.
[00:21:54.223 --> 00:21:55.864]  The channel's name is Rand Paul.
[00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:59.766]  Here's some of the science for the YouTube Science Deniers.
[00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:12.814]  A Danish study of 6,000 participants found that wearing a surgical mask did not significantly reduce a person's risk of COVID-19 infection compared to the risks facing those who did not wear masks.
[00:22:13.835 --> 00:22:25.022]  A Vietnamese study of 1,600 participants found that cloth masks allow for 97% penetration of particles the same size as the virus.
[00:22:25.622 --> 00:22:32.767]  This study also found that cloth mask wearers had a higher rate of infection than the control group who wore no masks.
[00:22:33.467 --> 00:22:37.509]  Now, when it comes to N95 masks, I have always said that those do work.
[00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:43.493]  Dr. Fauci knew that too, which is why he originally lied to the public and said that the masks don't work.
[00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:49.056]  He feared not enough health workers would be able to buy N95 masks if the public were buying them.
[00:22:49.516 --> 00:22:54.378]  He justified his lies by explaining that he was trying to shape human behavior.
[00:22:54.999 --> 00:23:00.182]  Like so many Fauci-ism, he lies to us for our own good, or so he believes.
[00:23:01.022 --> 00:23:05.265]  Ask any doctor or nurse what mask they wear when they go into a COVID patient's room.
[00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:10.128]  Only an N95 mask because the other masks don't work.
[00:23:10.148 --> 00:23:11.229]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:15.092]  And again, those are not even 50% effective, but it does do something.
[00:23:15.872 --> 00:23:18.294]  So this is all a giant, complete lie.
[00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:19.135]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:22.037]  He's elected in the government at the highest level.
[00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:29.213]  of the legislative branch and he can't talk to you over Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, any of it.
[00:23:29.433 --> 00:23:30.894]  They're all together in a cartel.
[00:23:31.054 --> 00:23:41.019]  They're not just working with a select party in government and a foreign power, the United Nations, but they are cartelling together to agree to have the same message.
[00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:44.400]  So it's not just one company has this policy, another has that policy.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.001]  That's bad enough.
[00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:46.882]  They're all lockstep together.
[00:23:47.702 --> 00:23:53.726]  Which is why the battle plan to take over is called Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller Foundation, who's in charge of U.S.
[00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:56.968]  government policy and now censoring sitting U.S.
[00:23:57.368 --> 00:23:57.748]  Senators.
[00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:00.109]  Cuz I don't love you.
[00:24:00.129 --> 00:24:02.611]  Love you by that.
[00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:04.412]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:05.853 --> 00:24:07.274]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:24:13.097 --> 00:24:15.418]  And to say that I've reached information overload is
[00:24:17.381 --> 00:24:22.205]  Putting it extremely, extremely lightly, but I think you're all in that same position.
[00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:30.131]  And that's the globalist plan, is to overwhelm us so much with the tyranny that we just give up and roll over and let them take over completely.
[00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:35.055]  But that is far worse than the position we're already in, and much more hellish.
[00:24:35.616 --> 00:24:41.000]  And God's watching, and we've got children to defend, and a lot of innocent people, so we're not gonna let that happen.
[00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:46.885]  Now, I was about to go live today,
[00:24:51.465 --> 00:25:03.553]  And going over literally hundreds of articles, I noticed a theme last night and this morning, doing research, because I've been doing research since 5 a.m.
[00:25:03.573 --> 00:25:07.135]  this morning, of major victory.
[00:25:08.476 --> 00:25:16.822]  So I intended to come in today and write a headline about major victory and the globalists are in trouble, and I got so busy with all the other news that came out and came up.
[00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:21.178]  That I forgot about that big stack of news.
[00:25:21.278 --> 00:25:22.559]  I've got right here all the victories.
[00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:25.902]  And even more coming in as we speak.
[00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:31.146]  They just brought me more victories.
[00:25:31.507 --> 00:25:31.887]  Big ones.
[00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:33.649]  And that reminded me
[00:25:34.927 --> 00:25:37.028]  Of that I was going to have a whole show about victory.
[00:25:37.468 --> 00:25:41.370]  But as bad as things are, we need to know what's working, what's good, and where we're winning.
[00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.292]  And we're making some major headway against the globalists.
[00:25:44.312 --> 00:25:49.194]  In fact, if you watch them on CNN or MSNBC or even in the foreign news, they look upset.
[00:25:49.254 --> 00:25:52.336]  They look really like they're fighting for their lives because they are.
[00:25:52.396 --> 00:25:54.537]  I mean, they have committed incredible crimes.
[00:25:55.557 --> 00:25:57.879]  And so there were two things I wanted to hit today.
[00:25:58.679 --> 00:25:59.800]  How they're going after our children.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.182]  And now this is truly an existential threat and how it's on us if we don't stop them.
[00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:06.414]  And I mean it.
[00:26:06.554 --> 00:26:08.196]  I mean, it is on us that we don't stop them.
[00:26:12.318 --> 00:26:13.879]  And for me, it's not a courage issue.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.903]  You got to stop them the right way or they can use your action against them as a victory.
[00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:24.306]  So it's like threading the needle, but my brain's working around the clock.
[00:26:24.346 --> 00:26:24.706]  Believe me.
[00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:28.589]  I got gray hair for a reason.
[00:26:33.939 --> 00:26:45.085]  So we've got that big area, and how that as a binary point orbits the other, and it orbiting itself, the big victories that are happening.
[00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:54.910]  But then, I was reminded watching the clips this morning of Senator Paul, who is a medical doctor on top of it,
[00:26:57.034 --> 00:27:01.316]  Trained in epidemiology, trained in virology.
[00:27:01.356 --> 00:27:02.397]  That's what he was first going to do.
[00:27:02.997 --> 00:27:04.397]  Trained in pathology.
[00:27:05.718 --> 00:27:07.199]  That's what he was for years.
[00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:11.621]  And then he wanted to make money because his wife, I don't blame her, wanted money to live in a nice house.
[00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:13.762]  And a lot of doctors don't make a lot of money these days.
[00:27:13.802 --> 00:27:17.243]  He went to be an optometrist and then on to do eye surgeries.
[00:27:18.864 --> 00:27:19.965]  Become a top eye surgeon.
[00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:21.225]  That's where you make the money.
[00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:24.867]  But here he is.
[00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:32.941]  Laying out things that are on the damn box of the mask.
[00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:35.263]  Even the M95 says can't protect you.
[00:27:35.283 --> 00:27:36.464]  Because it's not, you know, 100%.
[00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:39.606]  It's not even close.
[00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:42.848]  But the cloth mask, zero.
[00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.152]  And he can't get that information out.
[00:27:49.572 --> 00:27:52.814]  And that just shows you how the abuse of these globalists has been operating.
[00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:55.076]  Where we've been under their thumbs so long.
[00:27:59.696 --> 00:28:01.297]  That we just become accustomed to it.
[00:28:01.617 --> 00:28:02.937]  And that's how tyrants get you.
[00:28:04.318 --> 00:28:07.960]  It's just by increment, taking more and more away, where we just accept it.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.842]  So I have the incredible abuse of our children, a stack of that, where they're now calling them murderers.
[00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:17.124]  First it was drunk drivers and criminals not wearing masks.
[00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:20.765]  And now adults are murderers if you're not wearing a mask.
[00:28:21.125 --> 00:28:23.967]  And now children are murderers!
[00:28:25.227 --> 00:28:28.909]  Oklahoma school board member says maskless children will commit murder!
[00:28:30.071 --> 00:28:31.292]  And push for school mandate.
[00:28:32.893 --> 00:28:36.094]  Then I got a clip of a mother out in California, Owen Schroyer played it yesterday.
[00:28:37.195 --> 00:28:39.196]  I didn't see it in my list, but I want to make sure it gets added.
[00:28:39.216 --> 00:28:41.177]  I want to air her, start of the next hour.
[00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:45.420]  Where this mother, oh it is on the list, good job.
[00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:55.145]  Where the mother just destroys them and explains, tyrants are zero, the humans are 100%.
[00:28:57.757 --> 00:29:01.158]  Tyrannies always fall, and she basically explains to them how to cow eat the cabbage.
[00:29:01.498 --> 00:29:03.739]  She says, we fix your brakes and we cook your food.
[00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:13.021]  And see, that's what always happens when a tyranny goes long enough, and if men actually roll over, historically, the women just start poisoning everybody.
[00:29:15.742 --> 00:29:17.402]  So, look for that to begin.
[00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.843]  In fact, it's already starting.
[00:29:19.223 --> 00:29:19.943]  And that's what I've said.
[00:29:19.983 --> 00:29:26.405]  If you're the domestic help of these globalists, take really good care of them and tuck them in real tight at night.
[00:29:27.554 --> 00:29:32.499]  Because we should bow down to them and let them murder our children, and let them chem-trail us.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.345]  And I think we should not hair a little hair on their chinny-chin-chin.
[00:29:41.807 --> 00:29:44.450]  But I don't think we're to that point yet, are we?
[00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:46.772]  Having to tuck them in at night?
[00:29:48.013 --> 00:29:51.697]  Because when there's the absence of men, women will become men.
[00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.533]  It's not that women are even cowards, they're not.
[00:29:59.793 --> 00:30:01.795]  They're looking for direction like anybody else.
[00:30:02.275 --> 00:30:05.799]  But see, when there is no direction, women are going to take things into their own hands.
[00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:07.240]  Just watch, it's going to happen.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.521]  It's already started.
[00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:10.523]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:30:10.563 --> 00:30:13.025]  You know, their children are going to take matters into their own hands.
[00:30:14.927 --> 00:30:20.272]  That's why these globalists all live alone by themselves and lock their doors at night and have armed guards, because they know they're bad people.
[00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:27.915]  And they know that they're gonna push and push and push and censor and prod and bully till we come for them.
[00:30:30.956 --> 00:30:47.100]  And they think we're so stupid they've set up the societal calamity, the societal clash, the societal fault lines, the battle lines are on if you're gay or straight, white or black, or where you live or what your income is.
[00:30:49.292 --> 00:30:52.614]  When it's about your political affiliation, pro-human or anti-human.
[00:30:54.735 --> 00:30:56.916]  And it's about what you stand for.
[00:30:58.777 --> 00:31:04.800]  And so they hope, as they implode the economy, consolidate control, to then stir up riots and go, look, it's the black people!
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.561]  And then have the state side with the, quote, black people.
[00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:16.645]  So that when there's a revolution, it's white against black, instead of against the globalist.
[00:31:17.406 --> 00:31:17.806]  Humans.
[00:31:19.696 --> 00:31:23.098]  I'm for the Red Revolution, but not the one of the Communists.
[00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.699]  See, they always invert everything.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.080]  We've all got red blood.
[00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:28.362]  The blood of Christ frees us and heals us.
[00:31:29.223 --> 00:31:31.704]  So I call for fighting fire with fire.
[00:31:32.245 --> 00:31:38.409]  I call for countering the red terror with the red blood of Jesus.
[00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:46.249]  And coming together with our red blood and saying, you think you scare us with your red star gonna spill our blood?
[00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:52.412]  We're more than happy when the rubber meets the road to spill blood, but believe it's going to be a lot more of your blood getting spilled than ours.
[00:31:53.233 --> 00:31:54.393]  And we don't have anything to prove.
[00:31:55.134 --> 00:31:58.956]  Good people are killing machines, organized, focused, ready, committed.
[00:32:00.217 --> 00:32:04.940]  We don't want to kill to empower ourselves or to steal something or to feel like we're men.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.001]  We only kill to protect the innocent.
[00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:08.582]  But when the killing starts,
[00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:18.160]  The killing's gonna go for a long time, and those that started the fight are gonna reap the whirlwind.
[00:32:21.403 --> 00:32:29.629]  But I'll tell you this, most of these slaves of the system don't even know what they're part of, and that's why it's key for us to give the testament of the reality to understand what's going on.
[00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:32.569]  Okay, so I'm going to try to reset here.
[00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:45.520]  There is just so much to cover, so much incredible news, but we've already hit the censorship of our government, of our elected officials, by this foreign, multinational evil coming in that's taking over.
[00:32:47.062 --> 00:32:58.852]  And when we return, I want to just hit the latest with all these top scientists coming out and confirming the really, really
[00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.733]  Powerful information that the COVID vaccine is a bioweapon.
[00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:05.035]  The next hour, I'm going to lay out the good news.
[00:33:05.415 --> 00:33:06.976]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[00:33:07.276 --> 00:33:07.717]  Stay with us.
[00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:09.938]  All right.
[00:33:10.018 --> 00:33:12.900]  Next hour, we got some really good news.
[00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:24.169]  That monster, that gun-grabbing anti-American who works for that other piece of trash milling, another piece of garbage honorary that ran the gun confiscation during Katrina.
[00:33:30.117 --> 00:33:35.622]  They have had to back off forced inoculation of the troops in the fine print.
[00:33:35.642 --> 00:33:39.285]  I'm going to be covering that for you coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:44.369]  That is just the beginnings of the good news as we begin to turn the tide against these monsters.
[00:33:44.449 --> 00:33:47.692]  But this is key, beyond key.
[00:33:47.812 --> 00:33:55.218]  It's seminal and it is absolutely the genesis foundation of everything we do.
[00:33:57.654 --> 00:34:00.198]  They shoot for a million miles of power grab.
[00:34:00.318 --> 00:34:01.560]  We push them back 800,000 miles.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.770]  But they still get 200,000 miles on us.
[00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:14.649]  You gotta push them all the way back and annihilate them politically.
[00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.870]  You gotta remove them or they grow back like a tumor.
[00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.452]  You don't go into a cancer and cut 80% of it out.
[00:34:19.752 --> 00:34:20.893]  No, it just grows right back.
[00:34:21.453 --> 00:34:23.214]  And then it metastasizes and then it's too late.
[00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:25.075]  Now you got cancer all over your body.
[00:34:25.736 --> 00:34:33.920]  So, the reason they do all these outrageous things is the more they hail Mary, the more they move the ball down the field.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.222]  Because we never take the quarterback out.
[00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:43.430]  We never go and dig them out of their holes that they're running their systems out of in the big foundations.
[00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:51.072]  And so I don't want them to trick us into any race wars or any blowing up buildings or any type of offensive violence.
[00:34:51.112 --> 00:34:52.352]  That is all no-no.
[00:34:53.432 --> 00:34:59.014]  We need to violently, with the truth, assault them and expose them and light them up politically
[00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:09.312]  So that everyone knows they're the author of all the destruction that's coming, and then if they're blamed for what they're doing, they'll be destroyed by their own political weight.
[00:35:10.332 --> 00:35:10.773]  You understand?
[00:35:12.593 --> 00:35:16.434]  They need to blame it on all sorts of other side issues, as long as they get the blame.
[00:35:17.914 --> 00:35:28.557]  Everything they're doing right now will end up being hung on them where it deserves to be, instead of being put on our children with the news saying they're little germ carriers and they're causing the new big outbreak.
[00:35:28.577 --> 00:35:28.957]  And by the way,
[00:35:30.117 --> 00:35:33.219]  There were the same number of deaths and illnesses last year as the year before.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.782]  This year, I don't just have it anecdotally, I've got the sources.
[00:35:37.283 --> 00:35:46.109]  There is horrible COVID all over the world right now, and it's not the COVID of last year that was the exaggerated, hyped-up virus.
[00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:57.618]  It's the spike protein sloughing off and shedding and spreading, but the majority, 95% around the world's the number, of people ill took the shot.
[00:35:58.567 --> 00:35:59.868]  And that's even mainline news now.
[00:36:00.828 --> 00:36:04.289]  So, first Biden says, oh, it's 100%, you can't get COVID, you take the shot.
[00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:05.490]  He said it again last night.
[00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.211]  But his surrogates go, whoa, no, no, it's just not as serious if you take it.
[00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:14.873]  So since when does an inoculation heartway work?
[00:36:14.913 --> 00:36:15.813]  That's not how it works.
[00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.414]  This is not an inoculation.
[00:36:17.454 --> 00:36:18.995]  This is a gene therapy.
[00:36:20.795 --> 00:36:24.797]  And they always planned, over a year ago, they said, oh, you'll need booster shots.
[00:36:25.317 --> 00:36:26.397]  This is a gene therapy.
[00:36:26.738 --> 00:36:27.678]  This is not a vaccine.
[00:36:29.488 --> 00:36:38.654]  And so what they've done is removed a large portion of the world's immune system where they're going to need these shots now on a routine basis for every cold virus that comes along.
[00:36:42.256 --> 00:36:44.818]  But then every shot ends up making them sick.
[00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:47.199]  They're only making it worse.
[00:36:47.259 --> 00:36:54.104]  And yeah, yesterday, the Secret Service was directing Puppet Biden on where to go back into the building.
[00:36:54.943 --> 00:37:02.171]  Where the proper entrance was, and he didn't know, and went and got lost, and they just let him in to another door.
[00:37:03.572 --> 00:37:05.174]  You think, oh, that's a joke on the globalists.
[00:37:05.194 --> 00:37:05.995]  Oh, that's a joke on us.
[00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:15.305]  They put him in knowing he was cognitively bad, and knowing he would degenerate like this, and knowing it would create a constitutional crisis.
[00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.625]  And they've got all the crises lined up for next year.
[00:37:20.086 --> 00:37:22.869]  That's when the real super lockdowns are going to happen.
[00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.852]  They're already putting them in, as you see right now.
[00:37:26.134 --> 00:37:34.285]  But doing it more stealthily, so you can't create opposition against it, so they can kill the real economy, consolidate control, as they prepare the death blow.
[00:37:38.134 --> 00:37:38.534]  There it is.
[00:37:38.574 --> 00:37:42.615]  Swedish expert claims people could require as many as five COVID vaccine shots.
[00:37:42.715 --> 00:37:43.395]  It's not an expert.
[00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:44.975]  It's a PR firm person.
[00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.276]  They were always planning that.
[00:37:46.716 --> 00:37:49.316]  Justin Trudeau's already bought the shots out to 2026.
[00:37:49.416 --> 00:37:53.897]  He's going to make you take them to travel or live.
[00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:55.198]  Experimental shots!
[00:37:57.478 --> 00:38:02.739]  You see, by having experimental shots, no one has any liability because the law is not even being followed.
[00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:05.160]  It's just a wild, wild west.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.241]  Let's go over these headlines.
[00:38:07.581 --> 00:38:13.404]  Study finds most highly educated Americans are also the most vaccine hesitant.
[00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:16.946]  Yeah, the majority of the CDC won't take the shots.
[00:38:18.007 --> 00:38:19.808]  Very powerful article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:38:20.248 --> 00:38:21.229]  I suggest you share it.
[00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:26.532]  The left's always about how educated they are and how they're all the smart people, but that's not the case.
[00:38:27.252 --> 00:38:32.035]  Also, the higher your earnings are, the more you don't take it because you know how to read.
[00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:39.854]  COVID cases fell 40% in the UK after restrictions were lifted, proving the experts wrong yet again.
[00:38:39.874 --> 00:38:42.476]  You gotta stay in your house by yourself, not out in the sunshine.
[00:38:42.896 --> 00:38:45.317]  Makes regular viruses make you sick, then they call it COVID.
[00:38:47.618 --> 00:38:53.722]  Lindsey's Logic, he actually says on video, you need to get vaccinated because I took the shot and got sick.
[00:38:55.919 --> 00:39:00.263]  Fauci supports vaccine mandates and says, now isn't the time for individual freedom.
[00:39:00.543 --> 00:39:00.924]  Oh, no.
[00:39:01.384 --> 00:39:05.208]  It's time for you that ran the Wuhan lab and that owned the vaccine stocks to take over.
[00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.033]  Judge orders man to get COVID injection or face jail time.
[00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:13.435]  This is happening all over the country.
[00:39:13.475 --> 00:39:14.917]  It's happened several times in Houston.
[00:39:15.257 --> 00:39:20.502]  This is now happening in Hamilton County, Judge, in Ohio.
[00:39:21.988 --> 00:39:23.528]  So now the judge is a doctor.
[00:39:23.548 --> 00:39:35.071]  I've seen cases now where judges, one in Texas, ordered the person's like five-year-old kid, it's like three or four or five, it was a small child, to take the shot.
[00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:39.772]  And the people went, in the divorce hearing, the judge said, I'm not going to give it to either one of you.
[00:39:39.852 --> 00:39:41.492]  You must give the child the COVID shot.
[00:39:41.572 --> 00:39:42.872]  And they said, it's not approved.
[00:39:43.092 --> 00:39:44.453]  The judge said, I don't care.
[00:39:44.473 --> 00:39:45.853]  I rule Earth!
[00:39:47.878 --> 00:39:50.219]  You can't even get the experimental shot for kids yet.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.841]  But the judge doesn't care because they're a virtue signaler.
[00:39:56.923 --> 00:39:57.944]  This is coming up next hour.
[00:39:57.964 --> 00:39:59.124]  In fact, I'm going to play this first.
[00:39:59.164 --> 00:39:59.945]  Talk about victory.
[00:40:00.165 --> 00:40:00.885]  Talk about success.
[00:40:00.905 --> 00:40:01.686]  Talk about fighting back.
[00:40:03.347 --> 00:40:04.708]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:08.690]  Mom destroys county board over COVID restrictions, masks, and vaccines.
[00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.511]  That is coming up, start of the next hour.
[00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:19.200]  There's another very powerful report from John Bowne here at the start of the report that's in the John Bowne section of Bandai Video.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.040]  I suggest you share it.
[00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:23.303]  A desperate message from the real medical community.
[00:40:23.603 --> 00:40:25.725]  I'm very proud of the real medical community.
[00:40:25.745 --> 00:40:30.548]  The vast majority are fighting back, speaking up against the censorship at every place they can.
[00:40:30.789 --> 00:40:37.654]  County commissioners, city councils, county fairs, churches, school boards, state legislatures, Congress.
[00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:41.537]  But they're being censored by multinational corporations in bed with China.
[00:40:41.897 --> 00:40:43.538]  How outrageous!
[00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:49.139]  This is a war of will for our children!
[00:40:49.399 --> 00:40:54.541]  Now they're coming with the deadly injections that don't even protect our children and make them sick!
[00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:59.703]  And are we going to put up with it and have their blood and their pain on our hands if we already put up with all the autistic children?
[00:40:59.903 --> 00:41:04.944]  That green-lit, this massive escalation, because we didn't stop what happened to our autistic boys!
[00:41:05.724 --> 00:41:07.205]  The globalists said, up the attack.
[00:41:09.226 --> 00:41:11.407]  This is so bombshell, I'll cover this after I cover that.
[00:41:11.847 --> 00:41:17.048]  Bombshell study finds mRNA vaccine may cause tragic and even catastrophic side effects.
[00:41:17.428 --> 00:41:19.849]  Major university, extremely prestigious.
[00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:22.290]  And another major university in Canada!
[00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:23.910]  We made a big mistake!
[00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:30.172]  COVID vaccine spike protein travels from the injection site and causes organ damage.
[00:41:30.692 --> 00:41:31.933]  That's coming up.
[00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:36.434]  There is so much to get to today.
[00:41:39.733 --> 00:41:49.305]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, I am energized because when we have the great products that you like that you reorder, we're able to stay on air and it's a symbiotic thing.
[00:41:49.345 --> 00:41:50.266]  You are our sponsor.
[00:41:50.346 --> 00:41:51.187]  You have funded this.
[00:41:51.448 --> 00:41:52.148]  You have done this.
[00:41:52.229 --> 00:41:57.075]  You have been the main engine, the will behind the fight against these people.
[00:41:58.487 --> 00:42:02.950]  Because of the COVID lockdowns, not from COVID, but from the globalists.
[00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.891]  COVID didn't do this, the globalists did it.
[00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:08.313]  A lot of our products we couldn't get in because we use high-quality, organic, high-end products.
[00:42:08.473 --> 00:42:09.674]  We could buy plenty of stuff from China.
[00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:14.457]  I could buy all the charcoal toothpaste I wanted from China for one-third the price, but I didn't do it.
[00:42:15.498 --> 00:42:17.159]  Six months later, it's back in.
[00:42:17.539 --> 00:42:20.520]  Activated Charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals that my dad designed.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.181]  Natural, fluoride-free.
[00:42:23.382 --> 00:42:25.523]  It's got the real peppermint and so much more in it.
[00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:26.943]  We're very, very proud of this.
[00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:29.444]  It's a powerful toothpaste.
[00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:29.444]  $9.95.
[00:42:29.504 --> 00:42:30.385]  It's a concentrate.
[00:42:30.405 --> 00:42:32.105]  It doesn't have any additives or garbage.
[00:42:32.506 --> 00:42:35.367]  It's got a 4.7 stars, 95% reviews.
[00:42:37.108 --> 00:42:41.470]  It is now back in stock along with the Activated Charcoal Essential Oil.
[00:42:42.631 --> 00:42:43.612]  We're good to go.
[00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:05.636]  On these products, 50% off is going to end in one week as we're running out of them.
[00:43:05.677 --> 00:43:13.185]  The vitamin C with the zinc, the vitamin D3 with the calcium, the multivitamin, that's still 50% off, all ends next week.
[00:43:13.205 --> 00:43:14.647]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:43:14.747 --> 00:43:18.592]  All right, hour number two and the huge victories against tyranny coming up!
[00:43:18.952 --> 00:43:20.534]  Tell everybody, tune in now!
[00:43:20.594 --> 00:43:21.816]  However you're listening!
[00:43:23.407 --> 00:43:28.989]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:36.131]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:43:36.992 --> 00:43:38.532]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:43:39.292 --> 00:43:42.793]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:43:44.795 --> 00:43:52.581]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:43:52.961 --> 00:43:58.045]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:43:58.865 --> 00:44:08.932]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.

[00:44:20.341 --> 00:44:21.622]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:44:22.964 --> 00:44:24.406]  All right, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:24.446 --> 00:44:27.048]  Next segment, I'm going to get into some big victories against the globalists.
[00:44:27.108 --> 00:44:29.531]  A lot of you are asking, why aren't you at the Cyber Symposium?
[00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:38.380]  Well, I took the airplane I was supposed to get on this morning, breaking down, and then not being able to get another flight until this evening, and then only getting one day of the symposium.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.901]  I took that as a thing to just stay here.
[00:44:40.302 --> 00:44:40.963]  I was on the fence.
[00:44:41.003 --> 00:44:41.563]  I wanted to go.
[00:44:41.623 --> 00:44:42.484]  It's so jam-packed.
[00:44:42.544 --> 00:44:43.665]  It's got a lot of great information.
[00:44:43.685 --> 00:44:45.888]  You've got a feed of it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:44:46.388 --> 00:44:50.911]  And so I just decided to stay here with my family and with the crew, which is my family.
[00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:52.472]  But here's a Dr. Frank.
[00:44:52.672 --> 00:44:55.134]  I was just getting a cup of coffee like 30 minutes ago.
[00:44:55.614 --> 00:44:58.036]  We have OAN on in the coffee room, not Fox anymore.
[00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:03.589]  And I saw this guy out there laying out little factoids that are absolutely key.
[00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.030]  The way these big companies use words.
[00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.151]  Here it is.
[00:45:08.191 --> 00:45:14.093]  Behind closed doors, tried to make it so that these machines were allowed to connect to the Internet.
[00:45:14.153 --> 00:45:15.073]  They would be allowed.
[00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:15.573]  Right.
[00:45:15.693 --> 00:45:16.674]  Allowed, allowed.
[00:45:20.394 --> 00:45:21.275]  Was the EAC.
[00:45:21.815 --> 00:45:24.137]  And they had the, what is the board?
[00:45:24.878 --> 00:45:30.602]  Yes, the board members with Dominion Voting, you know, all the ES&S, Hart InterCivic, all the companies.
[00:45:30.622 --> 00:45:32.824]  That they would be allowed during the election to be connected.
[00:45:32.904 --> 00:45:33.945]  They tried to sneak it in.
[00:45:34.245 --> 00:45:43.572]  And Philip Stark, who is on the, you know, an EAC board member, is in a lawsuit trying to stop that bill, or not that bill, but that amendment to their rules.
[00:45:43.952 --> 00:45:44.533]  Yes, yes.
[00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:48.175]  One of the things you've noticed is that there's a phrase, and
[00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.701]  There's a phrase you'll hear all the time.
[00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:54.025]  It says, the machines are not connected to the internet.
[00:45:54.045 --> 00:45:56.468]  Have you noticed they all say it exactly that way?
[00:45:56.848 --> 00:45:58.830]  That's a very parsed sentence.
[00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:00.953]  Deliberately said in that way.
[00:46:01.373 --> 00:46:03.896]  And, you know, sort of like what the definition of is, is.
[00:46:04.157 --> 00:46:04.637]  Remember that?
[00:46:04.717 --> 00:46:05.718]  The definition of is, is.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.661]  I'll do her next.
[00:46:09.002 --> 00:46:12.084]  There's this phrase, the machines are not connected to the internet.
[00:46:12.124 --> 00:46:15.386]  Well, if you think about it, if the machine's off right now, that's a true statement.
[00:46:16.027 --> 00:46:17.468]  The machines are not connected to the internet.
[00:46:17.488 --> 00:46:19.069]  If the machine's off, that's sort of true.
[00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:24.592]  Also, they didn't say the machines cannot be connected to the internet.
[00:46:24.612 --> 00:46:25.633]  They didn't say that, did they?
[00:46:26.013 --> 00:46:28.955]  They said they are not connected to the internet.
[00:46:29.276 --> 00:46:35.680]  Which I think, by extrapolation, what they're trying to get you to think in your head is that they are not connected during the election.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.602]  But then you even heard Patrick say a minute ago,
[00:46:39.403 --> 00:46:40.343]  We're good?
[00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.270]  Come on.
[00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.952]  You saw the DiPerno case.
[00:46:52.972 --> 00:46:55.534]  He's got photographs of the card that's embedded.
[00:46:55.674 --> 00:46:56.495]  You saw it in the movie.
[00:46:57.916 --> 00:47:00.658]  It's got the 3G and 4G cell phone card there.
[00:47:00.938 --> 00:47:03.480]  Well, I guess, does the cell phone count as the internet?
[00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:04.701]  You see what I mean?
[00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:06.583]  This is a parsed sentence.
[00:47:06.903 --> 00:47:07.103]  Right?
[00:47:07.143 --> 00:47:08.264]  This is a parsed sentence.
[00:47:08.845 --> 00:47:10.286]  And besides, we have the recordings.
[00:47:10.406 --> 00:47:12.347]  So, you know, let's stop arguing about it.
[00:47:12.387 --> 00:47:12.708]  Yes, dear?
[00:47:14.678 --> 00:47:15.639]  From Montana, right?
[00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:17.981]  From Montana, you bet.
[00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:21.845]  46 of the 56 counties in Montana use ES&S machines.
[00:47:22.305 --> 00:47:26.929]  The 10 counties that hand count are all green on Seth Keshel's map.
[00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:33.775]  So the county Republican chair says, no problem in Montana, we don't use Dominion.
[00:47:35.087 --> 00:47:41.574]  Yeah, um, this is one of those situations where you're being distracted by the dialogue.
[00:47:42.275 --> 00:47:45.718]  The dialogue makes it sound like there's one company that's the problem.
[00:47:46.039 --> 00:47:46.259]  No.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.741]  All of the machines are hacked.
[00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:50.663]  Because it's not just about the machines.
[00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:56.406]  If you look at the specific software, and this was a discussion yesterday.
[00:47:56.426 --> 00:47:57.386]  This is a great discussion.
[00:47:57.527 --> 00:48:01.088]  SQL management software that's installed on... SQL sequel.
[00:48:01.348 --> 00:48:14.071]  Yeah, so it's basically a database management program installed on this equipment that's not authorized by the EAC, but you don't even need to go into the Dominion system or the ES&S or the Heart system.
[00:48:14.371 --> 00:48:16.672]  You can go right to the server and manipulate the data.
[00:48:16.912 --> 00:48:20.193]  So that's really what they were showing in the little voting booth.
[00:48:20.593 --> 00:48:31.256]  That hacker piece is an SQL manager, and so it goes into the actual database, changes it, and pushes it back through the router to make the change on the actual system.
[00:48:31.696 --> 00:48:44.180]  So it's manipulating the database, not necessarily the votes, but it will make sure that at the server level... Alright, so that's the type of stuff that's going on, and these companies have said they're going to sue anybody that carries any of it.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:44.720]  Well, I mean...
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.481]  Whether you agree with the info or not, people have a right to hear this.
[00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:49.101]  They have a right to report on it and cover it.
[00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:50.581]  So whatever happens, happens.
[00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.162]  We're all in to defend the Republic.
[00:48:53.342 --> 00:48:56.182]  And Dominion's been decertified to a whole bunch of states.
[00:48:56.282 --> 00:48:57.983]  States thought that they weren't a good system.
[00:48:58.843 --> 00:49:04.404]  And so I think it's very legitimate what's going on up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
[00:49:04.444 --> 00:49:05.764]  And that's why we're covering it.
[00:49:06.605 --> 00:49:12.646]  But regardless, this is a fight that needs to happen as we say no to these hackable machines.
[00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:18.598]  I see so much positive news every day, but I tend to only give you the bad news.
[00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:24.741]  Because the one thing I won't put up with my crew is them holding any bad news back from me.
[00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:25.501]  And they're a great crew.
[00:49:26.301 --> 00:49:28.142]  But I want to know bad news yesterday.
[00:49:28.902 --> 00:49:29.942]  I don't want to know it later.
[00:49:29.962 --> 00:49:31.943]  I want to see it up front.
[00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:32.623]  I want to deal with it.
[00:49:33.263 --> 00:49:43.227]  And so when I get up here, I remember 15 years ago, off record, and I agreed to meet him off record, I met with some globalists.
[00:49:44.617 --> 00:49:47.678]  Second tier, well-known names right beneath the top people.
[00:49:49.439 --> 00:49:51.679]  And they said, Alex, it's always the same speech.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.280]  Don't you want to be a star instead of on a crusade?
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:54.981]  You're going to fail.
[00:49:55.021 --> 00:49:55.821]  The public's dumb.
[00:49:58.202 --> 00:49:59.582]  You know, you'll never be able to save them.
[00:50:01.323 --> 00:50:04.744]  Don't you get when you put out all this bad news, you just scare them and demoralize them.
[00:50:05.024 --> 00:50:05.944]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[00:50:05.964 --> 00:50:07.845]  They're not going to rally and fight like you will.
[00:50:09.105 --> 00:50:10.186]  You're our kind of people.
[00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.127]  And I'm like, really, because you don't feel like my type of people.
[00:50:15.048 --> 00:50:17.209]  I don't feel empowered and close to God around you guys.
[00:50:17.249 --> 00:50:18.510]  And I've told these people it's their face.
[00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:25.576]  So I don't tell those stories like, ooh, the globalists tried to get me on their team.
[00:50:25.616 --> 00:50:26.556]  They do that to everybody.
[00:50:28.078 --> 00:50:30.199]  Oh, the devil tried to collect me and put me in his pocket.
[00:50:30.259 --> 00:50:30.920]  Oh, I'm special.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.220]  No.
[00:50:32.561 --> 00:50:33.882]  This happens to anybody that's prominent.
[00:50:37.341 --> 00:50:49.945]  Unless you were not awake and didn't know what was going on because you were naive, then you get in the system like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, and then you either wake up or you have that flash of light moment.
[00:50:50.905 --> 00:50:53.486]  You have the wake up, flash of light moment.
[00:50:54.086 --> 00:51:03.889]  You can have the, throughout your life, see things, learn things from family, and understand how the world really works because of the blessing of being in a good family and you being at the right place at the right time like I did.
[00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:12.481]  Or you can be born into an evil family and evil system and know the truth from the beginning, but decide to serve evil.
[00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:14.423]  So there's those that serve evil from the beginning.
[00:51:14.743 --> 00:51:16.866]  There's those that because they want power serve evil.
[00:51:17.166 --> 00:51:23.254]  There are those that are ignorant and naive and buy into the corrupt system because they think it's actually good who wake up later.
[00:51:24.015 --> 00:51:25.257]  Then there's those of us that
[00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:36.424]  Grow up in a family that knows what's going on and then see what's really happening and are part of a larger quest to defeat the system that I then later discovered.
[00:51:36.905 --> 00:51:41.146]  It's not like some secret society or written rule or it's way beyond the devil's system.
[00:51:41.186 --> 00:51:42.086]  It's just, it is.
[00:51:43.747 --> 00:51:45.147]  And it's amazing.
[00:51:46.368 --> 00:51:49.669]  But then they come to you and they try to get you to join with them.
[00:51:56.451 --> 00:51:57.151]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:51:57.852 --> 00:52:07.035]  And the one thing they've told me over and over again, because I've had at least six meetings with The Globalist, like a seven to count over the phone.
[00:52:08.715 --> 00:52:17.439]  And hell, I guess eight if you count the Atlantic Monthly editor coming down here, but that's what that was too.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.921]  But the reason this is important
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.401]  Is they always say, Alex, you're just scaring them.
[00:52:30.322 --> 00:52:32.462]  You think you're empowering them to fight back.
[00:52:33.242 --> 00:52:34.603]  You're actually scaring them.
[00:52:35.983 --> 00:52:37.224]  They're not gonna fight now.
[00:52:37.824 --> 00:52:41.945]  And I, I remember always saying, I'm betting on humanity.
[00:52:42.105 --> 00:52:49.548]  I think if people know how horrible this is, they're going to wake up and decide to fight you instead of being slaves and being destroyed.
[00:52:49.928 --> 00:52:50.228]  And see,
[00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:54.060]  In that paradox is basically the universe.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:08.902]  People that believe in humanity, and believe that want to face the truth, and believe in making the world better, and people that believe humanity is garbage and trash, so you might as well treat them like trash, and use them and destroy them, because you could never build them up.
[00:53:09.123 --> 00:53:10.703]  But you yourself has fallen too.
[00:53:10.963 --> 00:53:18.324]  You're pretending you're doing all this evil to fill the place of evil, but you're really moral and good, when that's not what you're doing.
[00:53:18.504 --> 00:53:20.625]  But that's the perspective of most of the
[00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:22.941]  Satanist and Luciferians.
[00:53:24.042 --> 00:53:38.506]  And so, I've always told you the very worst stuff going on, because I believe if you know your neighbor's being raped and killed in a basement, you're gonna go try to save them.
[00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:40.447]  At least call 911.
[00:53:43.047 --> 00:53:45.048]  But see, there's that process of domestication.
[00:53:45.548 --> 00:53:47.689]  You don't go save the neighbor now, you call 911.
[00:53:50.865 --> 00:53:52.248]  I mean, I'm not looking for adventure.
[00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:53.430]  I'm not looking for a fight.
[00:53:53.711 --> 00:53:59.362]  But if I saw my neighbor being hit on the head with a pistol and drug into the house by robbers...
[00:54:00.444 --> 00:54:01.425]  I'd call 9-1-1.
[00:54:01.665 --> 00:54:02.505]  I'd say the address.
[00:54:03.025 --> 00:54:04.966]  Maybe not, because the cops would probably come shoot me too.
[00:54:05.707 --> 00:54:06.827]  Nah, I probably wouldn't even call the cops.
[00:54:06.887 --> 00:54:11.509]  I'd just get my shotgun or get my assault rifle and I'd go over there and go to town on those people.
[00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.791]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:15.031]  It's what I'm designed to do.
[00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:16.032]  I can't help it.
[00:54:16.272 --> 00:54:20.214]  It's like water going downhill from the mountaintop to the sea.
[00:54:20.554 --> 00:54:21.354]  It's on a mission.
[00:54:21.454 --> 00:54:22.615]  You can't stop it.
[00:54:24.537 --> 00:54:43.282]  And so the whole process of life is specializing people and putting you in this area or that area, or I do this or I do that, but I don't do this, I don't do that, until we're these domesticated jellyfish that you stand back and watch.
[00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:46.283]  I've told the story many times, and I'll get into the positive news here today.
[00:54:46.643 --> 00:54:48.264]  It's important to understand this, and I'm not a hero.
[00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:48.864]  I tell the story.
[00:54:49.144 --> 00:54:49.704]  It was easy.
[00:54:52.005 --> 00:54:53.005]  I'm in a LaMatta line.
[00:54:55.728 --> 00:54:56.469]  French restaurant.
[00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:58.030]  Not a fancy French restaurant.
[00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:00.012]  It's like this chain of restaurants.
[00:55:00.092 --> 00:55:02.134]  It's like almost fast food, but it's decent food.
[00:55:02.154 --> 00:55:03.436]  I think they've gone bankrupt or something.
[00:55:03.636 --> 00:55:04.357]  They're not in Austin anymore.
[00:55:04.377 --> 00:55:05.578]  I don't know why I'm telling that part of the story.
[00:55:05.678 --> 00:55:06.279]  It's how my brain works.
[00:55:06.299 --> 00:55:07.059]  I just tell you what I remember.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.841]  And I'm in there with my ex-wife.
[00:55:10.142 --> 00:55:13.125]  And my son is like a year and a half old.
[00:55:14.389 --> 00:55:21.274]  Rex, and this woman, this fat woman, starts turning purple and choking.
[00:55:21.294 --> 00:55:27.159]  Well, I'd gone to the bathroom, and I come back out, and my ex-wife, wife at the time, goes, this woman's choking.
[00:55:27.479 --> 00:55:29.461]  She's at this big table, like six, seven people.
[00:55:30.682 --> 00:55:32.904]  She probably weighs 300 pounds, probably five feet tall.
[00:55:33.624 --> 00:55:34.505]  No one's helping her.
[00:55:34.745 --> 00:55:35.606]  She's turning blue.
[00:55:35.746 --> 00:55:37.007]  She's starting to fall on the table.
[00:55:37.427 --> 00:55:39.569]  And I walk over, and I go, do the Hamlet maneuver.
[00:55:42.435 --> 00:55:44.196]  And they all look at me like I'm a space alien.
[00:55:45.297 --> 00:55:46.678]  And back then, I was in really good shape.
[00:55:47.018 --> 00:55:48.539]  I got a pickley up over my head, probably.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.622]  And I'm looking at these people, and they're going, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, like parrots.
[00:55:52.722 --> 00:55:58.667]  I mean, they probably said to me, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, and I'm just gonna get, so I have to start pushing them out of the way.
[00:55:58.827 --> 00:56:00.608]  They start going, hey, are you authorized?
[00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:01.769]  Hey, what are you doing?
[00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:02.369]  You don't know her.
[00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:02.950]  Hey, what?
[00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:08.554]  So I get her, and I do a Heimlich twice, and a huge piece of bread comes out of her mouth.
[00:56:10.802 --> 00:56:11.783]  Huge glob.
[00:56:11.883 --> 00:56:13.444]  She was turned out she was down syndrome.
[00:56:14.845 --> 00:56:16.066]  Huge glob comes out.
[00:56:16.086 --> 00:56:17.647]  So they don't care about their daughter.
[00:56:17.868 --> 00:56:18.488]  Their daughter's in there.
[00:56:18.548 --> 00:56:21.430]  Let her just feed half a fricking loaf of bread in her mouth.
[00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:25.494]  And I'm smart in that I know rat like people are.
[00:56:26.474 --> 00:56:27.695]  I said, well, he was pretty fat.
[00:56:27.715 --> 00:56:30.818]  I mean, I had to pick her up to get that bread out of her first time.
[00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:32.319]  I was like, boom.
[00:56:32.519 --> 00:56:34.140]  And I took a fire department training course.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.163]  I was like 13 on the swim team and
[00:56:39.261 --> 00:56:40.883]  They go, oh, thank you, you're a hero!
[00:56:41.183 --> 00:56:41.663]  Oh, oh!
[00:56:41.944 --> 00:56:43.726]  And then they all started looking at everyone.
[00:56:43.746 --> 00:56:44.186]  Is she hurt?
[00:56:44.406 --> 00:56:44.807]  Is she hurt?
[00:56:45.287 --> 00:56:47.429]  And I got my ex-wife and I said, let's get out of here.
[00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:49.712]  Because they would have sued me for saving her.
[00:56:50.132 --> 00:56:51.874]  That's the spirit of the left.
[00:56:52.174 --> 00:56:53.616]  They were going to wait until she died.
[00:56:53.656 --> 00:56:55.157]  The average cop comes in like 15 minutes.
[00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:57.498]  The average ambulance is about 50 minutes.
[00:56:57.518 --> 00:57:05.620]  They were going to let her die, chirping and squawking, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1.
[00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:11.582]  And I'm just like, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1.
[00:57:11.742 --> 00:57:13.922]  And they're like, they were having discussions on it.
[00:57:14.103 --> 00:57:15.643]  Well, who's going to call 9-1-1?
[00:57:15.863 --> 00:57:18.804]  So in like 20 seconds, I'm like, sitting there watching this happen.
[00:57:19.144 --> 00:57:20.444]  And that's what's happened to America.
[00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:23.605]  Everybody just sits there like it's somebody else's job to do.
[00:57:24.827 --> 00:57:28.791]  Oh, you don't want to save her because if you do, you know, you might break her rib.
[00:57:28.831 --> 00:57:30.914]  I think I did feel a rib kind of go a little bit.
[00:57:31.234 --> 00:57:31.995]  Hey, it's better than that.
[00:57:32.635 --> 00:57:35.058]  Lady is alive with a broken rib than dead, right?
[00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:36.620]  But the point is.
[00:57:39.249 --> 00:57:40.430]  They don't want to save you.
[00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.670]  They don't want to save me.
[00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.651]  They don't want to help us.
[00:57:43.011 --> 00:57:46.893]  And they think you're going to hear all this bad news and get in a fetal position.
[00:57:46.913 --> 00:57:47.994]  But I know you're like me.
[00:57:48.314 --> 00:57:50.295]  You're not going to get in a fetal position hearing all this.
[00:57:50.656 --> 00:57:55.518]  You're going to do something about it, just like we built this organization thanks to you!
[00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.629]  You think I just say thanks to you?
[00:57:58.929 --> 00:58:00.091]  YOU DID THIS!
[00:58:00.712 --> 00:58:02.155]  YOU PUT ON THE MAIN FIGHT!
[00:58:02.355 --> 00:58:03.377]  YOU'RE THE HEROES!
[00:58:03.577 --> 00:58:05.660]  YOU'RE THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED US!
[00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:06.882]  AND PRAYED FOR US!
[00:58:07.143 --> 00:58:08.084]  AND FOUGHT FOR US!
[00:58:08.445 --> 00:58:09.166]  US TOGETHER!
[00:58:10.202 --> 00:58:12.664]  We gave this fat-ass country the Heimlich Maneuver!
[00:58:13.425 --> 00:58:14.826]  We got the bread out of the throat!
[00:58:15.286 --> 00:58:16.968]  At least we got a fighting chance now!
[00:58:17.408 --> 00:58:28.057]  And I tell all the globalists, and Henry Kissinger, and the New World Order, and David Rockefeller, and Ted Turner, and all of you, and Prince Charles, you're gonna burn in hell, maggot!
[00:58:28.277 --> 00:58:29.438]  You selfie scum!
[00:58:30.546 --> 00:58:32.627]  And we're gonna get your ass for what you've done!
[00:58:32.647 --> 00:58:42.951]  And it doesn't matter what happens to me, because at the end of the day, there's a lot more people behind me, and our spirit will not let you target our healthy children with your poison crap, you vampires!
[00:58:43.472 --> 00:58:46.033]  I pray that God destroys you!
[00:58:46.053 --> 00:58:49.754]  I pray that God brings you low!
[00:58:49.774 --> 00:58:52.655]  I pray for your destruction!
[00:58:52.675 --> 00:58:55.477]  Alright, we are back live.
[00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:56.697]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:58:56.717 --> 00:58:57.878]  I'm about to give you the good news.
[00:58:58.817 --> 00:58:59.697]  There is a lot of it.
[00:59:00.418 --> 00:59:23.385]  But first off, before I play the clips, the Pentagon Press Secretary has reversed the communist, globalist thug, Austin and Milley, who's just as bad or worse, and said, oh no, there'll be religious exemptions and medical exemptions of troops that don't want to take the experimental gene therapy injection.
[00:59:24.546 --> 00:59:26.086]  So you see, there's a major pushback.
[00:59:26.126 --> 00:59:27.667]  That's just one of, like,
[00:59:28.717 --> 00:59:30.718]  Ten different positive pieces of news.
[00:59:31.279 --> 00:59:33.920]  But first, let me tell you what the real positive news is.
[00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:47.569]  There are so many city council and county commissioner and school board and state house videos going viral despite what Big Tech and the Chi Coms, the Democrats, want, that I could spend all day watching incredible eloquence.
[00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:54.514]  And it's that action of you marching against the globalists, of you taking action.
[00:59:55.882 --> 00:59:59.603]  That is absolutely incredible and nothing is going to stop you.
[00:59:59.683 --> 01:00:01.064]  Keep doing it.
[01:00:03.664 --> 01:00:06.685]  They try to make it hard to make you go sign up beforehand, do all this crap.
[01:00:06.725 --> 01:00:09.386]  Just do it and go speak up and just get in the game.
[01:00:09.406 --> 01:00:12.787]  So out of all the positive things that are happening and I'm about to cover.
[01:00:15.008 --> 01:00:16.068]  This lady, I love it.
[01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:28.741]  Because they're coming with violence to assault us, with experimental Nuremberg violating, deadly poison that they know on record doesn't work, destroys your immune system, gives you blood clots, and then sloughs and is causing the so-called COVID cases.
[01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:36.647]  Mainline science says 95% of the new cases are of the vaccinated, the deaths, the vaccinated.
[01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:41.370]  And they're calling it COVID and they're giving it to other people, which is what the top scientists warned.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:51.705]  So there's so many amazing moms and teachers and women kicking ass, but this lady, Mom Destroys County Board of Recovered Restrictions, Masks and Vaccines.
[01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:53.686]  This is Stephanie Kinsley.
[01:00:55.387 --> 01:00:58.008]  She does a great job at the Clark County Board of Commissioners.
[01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:00.770]  Here she is.
[01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:06.993]  My name is Stephanie Kinsley, S-T-E-P-G-N-I-E-K-I-N-S-L-E-Y.
[01:01:07.273 --> 01:01:08.294]  I was just
[01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:14.569]  I'm not even speaking to you guys anymore, because you've all shown us that you're in somebody's pocket.
[01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:17.650]  You can smirk all you want, ma'am, but you're a creep.
[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.271]  Okay, you're Marilyn.
[01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:20.952]  Your people are all corrupt.
[01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:25.614]  This is this guy who just voted for these masks, and now he won't wear them himself.
[01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:27.915]  So we all know you're in someone's pocket.
[01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:29.896]  You used to be my uncle's neighbor.
[01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.776]  Ma'am, you're... Ms.
[01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:34.998]  Kinsley, if I could ask you to please speak...
[01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:37.815]  It's a cut near my cost.
[01:01:57.455 --> 01:01:59.336]  Wait, here's the thing.
[01:01:59.376 --> 01:02:00.257]  We're the 99% people.
[01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:02.098]  Stop listening to these people.
[01:02:02.879 --> 01:02:04.320]  This is to everyone watching.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.401]  Stop listening to these people.
[01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:07.622]  There's nothing different.
[01:02:07.842 --> 01:02:12.925]  First of all, until they prove to me that we had a valid election, this is nothing more than a monarchy.
[01:02:13.285 --> 01:02:18.789]  This country has a 100% success rate on taking down monarchies.
[01:02:19.489 --> 01:02:18.789]  100%.
[01:02:19.509 --> 01:02:22.952]  Then look what happened in France after we did it.
[01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:26.034]  We'll just get the whole ball rolling across the globe all over again.
[01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:28.462]  Yes.
[01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:28.462]  100%.
[01:02:28.722 --> 01:02:30.262]  You guys know you're lying.
[01:02:30.322 --> 01:02:31.283]  You know you're wrong.
[01:02:31.403 --> 01:02:34.484]  And you can smirk and ignore us all you want.
[01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:35.704]  Play on your phones.
[01:02:36.204 --> 01:02:37.565]  It doesn't take away the fact.
[01:02:37.865 --> 01:02:39.946]  You know you're doing wrong.
[01:02:40.546 --> 01:02:41.566]  You know you're hurting kids.
[01:02:41.866 --> 01:02:43.287]  And you're letting children suffer.
[01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:54.691]  So everyone who's putting a mask on their child and putting a needle in their child's arm to prevent them from dying from something they have no chance of dying from in the first place, you're capitulating to tyrants.
[01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:57.813]  You're acquiescing to fascists.
[01:02:58.714 --> 01:03:00.735]  And this is going to win in my favor, you guys.
[01:03:00.755 --> 01:03:03.317]  100% success rate on this side.
[01:03:04.158 --> 01:03:07.801]  Tyrants have 100% failure rate in this country.
[01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:10.523]  No matter what your little smokes had to do about it.
[01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:17.108]  We're the ones who put your brakes in your cars, who makes your meals, who gets your pharmacy.
[01:03:17.368 --> 01:03:18.289]  We're everywhere.
[01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:20.791]  I'm not the one who should be scared.
[01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:21.512]  I'm the driver.
[01:03:22.577 --> 01:03:24.418]  That's exactly what Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:03:24.518 --> 01:03:26.059]  So if you don't like her, you don't like America.
[01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:28.500]  That's a female Thomas Jefferson right there.
[01:03:29.861 --> 01:03:32.482]  I guarantee she probably hasn't even read Jefferson, but she instinctively gets it.
[01:03:33.002 --> 01:03:35.563]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:38.945]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[01:03:40.206 --> 01:03:41.967]  And I don't need to make my bones of these people.
[01:03:42.007 --> 01:03:43.727]  I don't want to fight with the scum.
[01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:46.589]  But you're starting one with us, and you're pushing it.
[01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:48.936]  And we know what you're going to do.
[01:03:49.136 --> 01:03:51.979]  You're going to blow up a school, shoot up something and blame it on us.
[01:03:52.019 --> 01:03:52.660]  We already know that.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.022]  Nobody's going to buy it when you do it, scumbags.
[01:03:55.803 --> 01:03:57.305]  Our targets aren't the police.
[01:03:58.366 --> 01:04:00.188]  They're not innocent people in a federal building.
[01:04:00.228 --> 01:04:01.409]  It's not the FBI.
[01:04:01.689 --> 01:04:02.630]  It's not all that.
[01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:05.874]  Our enemies are the ruling corrupt globalist class.
[01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.732]  And we're not physically targeting anybody.
[01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:11.353]  You're targeting us with an assault.
[01:04:11.613 --> 01:04:16.397]  But we're pointing out that you're attacking us, and the universe doesn't work that way.
[01:04:16.657 --> 01:04:20.660]  For every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.343]  And I'm here as a warning sign to you.
[01:04:26.224 --> 01:04:27.125]  This way, death.
[01:04:27.185 --> 01:04:27.885]  Stop now.
[01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:30.707]  Stop now.
[01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.009]  Stop now.
[01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:35.331]  You are in grave danger.
[01:04:36.496 --> 01:04:43.540]  And I'm talking to the minions of Satan, the actual servants of Satan know this, and they've got a plan to destroy life, and that's their mission, and they're signed on to it.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:54.566]  But for most of the idiots, because let me tell you, we've had like, we had the head, it was like Cornell head chemist, head of the chemistry department, in front of UT.
[01:04:56.627 --> 01:04:57.947]  Dr. Conant, I think it was Cornell.
[01:04:58.868 --> 01:05:00.729]  Point is, one of those top universities.
[01:05:02.247 --> 01:05:02.828]  Ten years ago.
[01:05:03.629 --> 01:05:07.953]  And he comes with the Harvard studies about hydrofluorosilic acid, fluoride, lowering IQ cancer.
[01:05:08.314 --> 01:05:11.277]  And the city council laughed at him.
[01:05:12.118 --> 01:05:14.040]  He came all the way here to speak for three minutes.
[01:05:14.841 --> 01:05:16.743]  And they got up and laughed and walked out.
[01:05:17.624 --> 01:05:20.087]  I mean, again.
[01:05:21.448 --> 01:05:28.450]  Because they get $5 million a year in Austin from these big companies as subsidies to put that in our water.
[01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.310]  Why do they do that?
[01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.210]  It's an attack on our fertility.
[01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:32.390]  An attack on all of us.
[01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:33.971]  It's a sick joke to them.
[01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.631]  It's their religion to assault us and assault us.
[01:05:37.932 --> 01:05:44.513]  But if you try to inject an Austin City Council member with fluoride and kill him, they put you in a Supermax prison for it as a terrorist.
[01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:49.174]  But when they put it in your water and it kills you slowly, then it's funny, isn't it?
[01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:54.348]  I don't think anybody should hold down the mayor and inject him with hydrofluoric acid.
[01:05:54.588 --> 01:05:55.449]  He'd die in minutes.
[01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.891]  I'm just saying, stop slowly killing us two.
[01:06:00.871 --> 01:06:02.892]  Because the universe is going to bite you in the ass.
[01:06:03.032 --> 01:06:03.233]  Alright.
[01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:11.016]  The military coming out and saying, okay, we need to have objections for medical reasons and others.
[01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:12.978]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:06:12.998 --> 01:06:15.419]  Because Congress is like, hey, you can't do that.
[01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.019]  That's illegal.
[01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:16.559]  Which it is.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.481]  All of this, an experimental vaccine, that's illegal.
[01:06:20.538 --> 01:06:21.621]  But they're tricking us to do it.
[01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:23.766]  Now they're trying to bully us.
[01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:25.791]  It's just pushing, pushing, pushing.
[01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:29.059]  And now calling children murderers if they don't wear a mask?
[01:06:31.374 --> 01:06:34.275]  They want to see if you'll let convicted pedophiles come out directly in story time.
[01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:36.356]  They want to see if they can call your children murderers.
[01:06:36.596 --> 01:06:38.697]  They want to see if they can close the churches.
[01:06:38.937 --> 01:06:40.718]  They want to see what they can get away with.
[01:06:40.738 --> 01:06:52.343]  They want to trample you and train you and break you and condition you to be happy to go outside and show them a phone with a scanner so you can even go eat food someplace or have a job.
[01:06:52.683 --> 01:06:54.344]  They want you on your knees.
[01:06:54.584 --> 01:06:58.206]  Do you think you're going to be safer on your knees to these people?
[01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:05.413]  Or are you going to be in a better place saying no to them now?
[01:07:06.694 --> 01:07:09.975]  That's the question I'm asking you now.
[01:07:11.856 --> 01:07:14.978]  Living on your knees is the most dangerous place to be.
[01:07:15.618 --> 01:07:18.039]  I choose, on my feet, in attack.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.040]  Liberty once lost is lost forever.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:21.721]  John Adams.
[01:07:21.861 --> 01:07:28.784]  And that's why the chains are going on worldwide with these social credit scores and these QR codes to be able to go down the street or go to the grocery store.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.000]  It's here.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:37.303]  So this isn't a total and complete victory, but it's a partial one.
[01:07:37.963 --> 01:07:48.648]  The press secretary, Kirby, for the Pentagon, saying soldiers with pre-existing conditions, advice from doctors, might not have to take the COVID vaccines.
[01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:52.410]  They're trying to leave a little escape valve there for people they want to be able to keep in.
[01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.010]  Because the left's not taking this.
[01:07:54.051 --> 01:07:59.073]  They want to use this to purge people they know are patriots out of the military.
[01:08:00.908 --> 01:08:08.557]  Services will make call on religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccines, but you just can't announce that.
[01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:14.323]  You've got to have a member of the church you go to, the preacher, say that that is their stance.
[01:08:14.363 --> 01:08:19.970]  And the Baptist Church and all these groups you think are Christian, even though this has fetal genomes in it,
[01:08:21.892 --> 01:08:24.575]  The average so-called Baptist church won't even send that in for you.
[01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:25.416]  Or the Catholic church.
[01:08:25.817 --> 01:08:27.159]  Hell, the Pope says you should take it.
[01:08:27.559 --> 01:08:28.600]  So those aren't real churches.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.062]  Those are dens of devils.
[01:08:30.082 --> 01:08:32.786]  But that is at least somewhat of a victory at one level.
[01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:35.189]  Here is the Press Secretary for the Pentagon.
[01:08:36.623 --> 01:08:42.787]  If I can switch gears, John, this requirement in the military that everyone be vaccinated, could you give me a timeline on that?
[01:09:06.323 --> 01:09:06.964]  A matter of weeks.
[01:09:08.206 --> 01:09:15.738]  So if a soldier, for whatever reason, personal or otherwise, does not want to be vaccinated, what happens?
[01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:22.221]  Well, a member of the military who wants to claim a religious exemption can certainly do that.
[01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:23.402]  There's a process for that.
[01:09:23.943 --> 01:09:26.345]  It's not a blanket check.
[01:09:26.525 --> 01:09:29.968]  I mean, you've got to go through a process to get that approved.
[01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:36.814]  Troops who have pre-existing medical conditions or are on the vice of their physician might not have to take the vaccine.
[01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:40.878]  But if you're just objecting because you're objecting, once it's become mandatory, that's a lawful order.
[01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:41.698]  It's not a lawful order.
[01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.700]  He just said, like he's a Supreme Court, it's a lawful order.
[01:10:06.004 --> 01:10:11.967]  And they use a Supreme Court ruling from over 100 years ago to say it is, but that ruling's been overturned by the Supreme Court since then.
[01:10:12.307 --> 01:10:15.188]  The same order said they could sterilize poor black women.
[01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:22.812]  Hitler used that order for what he did with the Third Reich on record.
[01:10:22.912 --> 01:10:24.192]  Look up the Nuremberg trial.
[01:10:25.753 --> 01:10:27.294]  So when you're informed, it's crazy.
[01:10:28.074 --> 01:10:33.296]  If he gets a waiver, if the Secretary of Defense gets a waiver from the President, a waiver of what?
[01:10:33.776 --> 01:10:34.657]  Federal law!
[01:10:36.067 --> 01:10:40.250]  That you can't give experimental injections to the troops and they keep calling it a vaccine.
[01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.291]  Everything coming out of his mouth is a lie.
[01:10:44.372 --> 01:10:54.939]  A vaccine is an attenuated bacteria or virus so that your body learns how to recognize an outside force without having to face a force that can replicate.
[01:10:57.093 --> 01:11:00.115]  So the next time it comes in, the body immediately attacks it.
[01:11:00.596 --> 01:11:01.617]  It's a real science.
[01:11:02.137 --> 01:11:03.038]  It's got problems.
[01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:04.779]  The shots can be contaminated.
[01:11:05.119 --> 01:11:09.342]  If there's anything else in the shot, your body will become allergic to that.
[01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:13.526]  Your body will attack that.
[01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:16.328]  It'll have an autoimmune response to that.
[01:11:16.728 --> 01:11:18.009]  But that's a real technology.
[01:11:18.069 --> 01:11:18.870]  It's got problems.
[01:11:22.553 --> 01:11:25.275]  This isn't a vaccine!
[01:11:27.131 --> 01:11:30.514]  It is a GMO gene therapy.
[01:11:32.435 --> 01:11:38.319]  And it's caused more side effects than all vaccines since they started the reporting system in the 1980s.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:39.941]  In a year.
[01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:41.302]  Less than a year.
[01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:47.746]  This only started here seven months ago and the swath of destruction is incredible.
[01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:56.233]  So they can't even at this point make troops take it because the FDA hasn't approved it.
[01:11:57.435 --> 01:12:00.876]  Because they know they'll have no credibility ever again doing this.
[01:12:00.896 --> 01:12:01.636]  This is a big deal.
[01:12:02.176 --> 01:12:04.297]  They can't even get the agency they control to do it.
[01:12:05.598 --> 01:12:07.038]  So they want to say, look, we made the troops.
[01:12:07.898 --> 01:12:10.979]  Now let's make five-year-olds at elementary school.
[01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.200]  One day it's the troops got to take an experimental shot.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:19.222]  Now, you know, the old days it'd be a rabbit or a guinea pig or a rat or a pig or a cow.
[01:12:19.622 --> 01:12:20.942]  Now it's your troops.
[01:12:21.583 --> 01:12:22.723]  Now it's your children.
[01:12:24.653 --> 01:12:26.914]  Do I need to tell if we had real churches in this country?
[01:12:27.234 --> 01:12:32.997]  They'd be organizing protests out front of all the military bases, saying, protect our troops, they're not medical experiments, they're not lab rats.
[01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:42.721]  Pointing out the vaccine doesn't protect you, and that Fauci's a Chinese agent, and that it's a foreign bio-attack on America, and that China won't even take the vaccine Fauci's produced!
[01:12:43.241 --> 01:12:44.122]  Or that India won't!
[01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:47.223]  Or that the majority of people sick took the shot!
[01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:47.883]  No!
[01:12:48.404 --> 01:12:49.404]  Because it's a PSYOP!
[01:12:49.864 --> 01:12:53.366]  And that's how a PSYOP works, to see what they can get away with.
[01:12:54.858 --> 01:12:56.059]  What they can carry out against us.
[01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.502]  Because they need to depopulate us.
[01:12:59.602 --> 01:13:01.264]  America is not part of the New World Order.
[01:13:01.624 --> 01:13:08.230]  America needs to be stunted and collapsed and poisoned so that we can be brought down to size to be folded into world government.
[01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:11.393]  And they wouldn't do it because of nuclear weapons up front.
[01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:12.674]  They've got to do it covertly.
[01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.296]  And that's what this is.
[01:13:15.477 --> 01:13:21.242]  Every checklist you'd go off of to break down the country, to undermine it, to bankrupt it, to destroy it, they're following it.
[01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:24.480]  Here's some more interesting news.
[01:13:25.061 --> 01:13:25.521]  U.N.
[01:13:25.541 --> 01:13:27.163]  globalists arriving in U.K.
[01:13:27.183 --> 01:13:31.447]  for Climate Summit won't face COVID restrictions imposed on British citizens.
[01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:41.358]  All other foreign travelers and citizens will be put in quarantine and controlled, but not private corporate leaders and government leaders coming to set up the world government.
[01:13:42.178 --> 01:13:43.199]  Infowars.com.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.461]  Isn't that just special?
[01:13:46.018 --> 01:13:46.958]  Here's more of the good news.
[01:13:47.439 --> 01:13:54.982]  Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta will not require employees to get vaxxed because the majority of them say they're going to quit.
[01:13:55.602 --> 01:13:58.003]  If we stand together, this all goes away.
[01:13:58.603 --> 01:14:02.705]  But if they ever get the majority, then it's going to collapse like dominoes.
[01:14:05.046 --> 01:14:11.088]  So they're trying to get a vaccine passport to make flyers to do it, but their own people in the White House won't take the shots.
[01:14:11.728 --> 01:14:13.389]  And the Pentagon brass won't take the shots.
[01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:23.039]  Meanwhile, Macron says, listen to this 1984 statement, Macron says showing police your papers to visit a cafe is about freedom!
[01:14:25.602 --> 01:14:29.186]  While their borders are wide open and half the country is a Muslim, no-go zone ghetto.
[01:14:31.248 --> 01:14:35.493]  Reuters though reports, you know it's much higher than this, half of Paris cafes and bars
[01:14:36.661 --> 01:14:39.223]  Refusing to comply with vaccine passport scheme.
[01:14:39.523 --> 01:14:41.065]  A passport to go to a bar?
[01:14:41.465 --> 01:14:42.045]  A restaurant?
[01:14:42.366 --> 01:14:43.146]  The grocery store?
[01:14:43.206 --> 01:14:44.247]  Told you it was all coming!
[01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:45.148]  Here it is!
[01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:47.230]  Morgan News.
[01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:56.337]  The national organization in the UK of the military and the government, private healthcare people, has already come out and said don't give under 16 the shots.
[01:14:56.798 --> 01:14:57.638]  Don't give over 75 shots.
[01:14:57.678 --> 01:14:58.919]  Don't give pregnant women the shots.
[01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:00.641]  Because they know they're signing on to mass murder.
[01:15:02.677 --> 01:15:10.985]  Now their top advisor says lockdowns can no longer be justified and that they're not protecting people, they're causing mass suicide and depression.
[01:15:14.988 --> 01:15:16.470]  And other folks are fighting back.
[01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:21.334]  Parents are filing complaint against Atlanta Elementary School for segregating students by race.
[01:15:21.814 --> 01:15:27.820]  Yes, they've actually put white classrooms and black classrooms to then teach whites they're evil, to teach blacks they're communist.
[01:15:31.533 --> 01:15:36.255]  Virginia teacher resigns after order to snitch on dissenters in the woke agenda.
[01:15:36.275 --> 01:15:37.136]  That's next segment.
[01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:40.757]  And then all the other big news that's positive.
[01:15:40.777 --> 01:15:48.881]  Bombshell study finds mRNA vaccine may cause tragic and even catastrophic side effects for a prestigious medical institution.
[01:15:48.901 --> 01:15:50.041]  We'll tell you about that next segment.
[01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:52.342]  And another major Canadian university.
[01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:53.683]  We made a big mistake.
[01:15:53.743 --> 01:15:58.505]  COVID vaccine spike protein travels from injection site is causing organ damage.
[01:15:58.565 --> 01:16:00.306]  That's all coming up.
[01:16:02.022 --> 01:16:03.503]  They're never going to suppress the truth.
[01:16:04.584 --> 01:16:07.246]  They're going to push and push and push, though, because they're all in now.
[01:16:08.667 --> 01:16:13.171]  And it's going to come to catastrophic blows, which I wish we could stop, but here it is.
[01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:18.476]  Study finds most highly educated Americans are also the most vaccine-hesitant, of course.
[01:16:19.465 --> 01:16:22.587]  The more you know, the more you know how criminal these people are.
[01:16:23.227 --> 01:16:23.847]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:23.887 --> 01:16:31.871]  Don't forget, sold out for six months, our activated fluoride-free charcoal toothpaste, back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[01:16:32.011 --> 01:16:33.072]  Finally back in stock.
[01:16:33.832 --> 01:16:36.454]  The COVID shutdown's almost made us never have this again.
[01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:40.496]  One last breath, the four winds blow.
[01:16:41.056 --> 01:16:42.437]  Better raise your ears.
[01:16:43.197 --> 01:16:45.518]  The sound of hooves knock at your door.
[01:16:47.219 --> 01:16:48.300]  I've been playing this song
[01:16:50.049 --> 01:16:57.216]  Written by Dave Mustaine back in like 1989 or whatever it was.
[01:16:57.677 --> 01:16:57.857]  Hell, 1988.
[01:16:57.897 --> 01:16:59.959]  Maybe even earlier.
[01:16:59.979 --> 01:17:03.063]  For a long time.
[01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:11.031]  And here on air, I've talked a lot about, we'll come to that moment when the four horsemen come a-knockin'.
[01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:23.723]  And here we are as they come for our children and all of us with a deadly poison that makes our body attack itself and grows mad cow disease inside our bodies.
[01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:25.284]  And even U.S.
[01:17:25.324 --> 01:17:29.367]  senators that expose it are censored off the internet and we just lay here and take it.
[01:17:31.048 --> 01:17:32.769]  But not you, not this audience.
[01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:37.132]  You're an audience of activists, men and women in the arena, and I salute
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.581]  And I thank you all.
[01:17:39.601 --> 01:17:50.048]  And I've got a lot of other critical news and important information and I'm gonna open the phones up in the next hour so we can hear from the forgotten that aren't supposed to be heard.
[01:17:50.068 --> 01:17:54.852]  Open phones for people to tell us their vaccine stories.
[01:17:57.774 --> 01:18:03.638]  We'll load the phones with 20 or 30 callers and they'll all tell you what happened with the vaccines and how horrible they were.
[01:18:03.658 --> 01:18:07.581]  And maybe one leftist will sneak through and make jokes and laugh about it.
[01:18:08.971 --> 01:18:11.972]  Well, how you laugh at your own people being attacked and killed like this.
[01:18:13.432 --> 01:18:17.194]  Why you laugh like a fool if you are a fool at your own destruction.
[01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:20.775]  That's coming up as well.
[01:18:23.016 --> 01:18:27.757]  Separately, you know, I was thinking about something this morning.
[01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:36.100]  I thought I ought to tell people a story, but I can't because I had to sign an undisclosure to do it.
[01:18:40.294 --> 01:18:43.115]  And I wish in hindsight I wouldn't have signed the non-disclosure.
[01:18:47.438 --> 01:18:51.079]  But, let me just tell you this way.
[01:18:54.801 --> 01:18:57.302]  I recently met with representatives of the globalists.
[01:19:00.524 --> 01:19:06.347]  And they told me, as if I didn't know this, we are criminals.
[01:19:09.505 --> 01:19:11.187]  Like, you know, you've seen the Godfather movie?
[01:19:11.608 --> 01:19:14.731]  We control things, and our job is to destroy you.
[01:19:18.015 --> 01:19:21.119]  And then I said, well, what is it you want?
[01:19:22.681 --> 01:19:26.365]  And it was just like the James Bond movie, I guess with Goldfinger.
[01:19:27.686 --> 01:19:28.608]  You expect me to talk?
[01:19:30.014 --> 01:19:32.175]  He goes, no, Mr. Bond, we expect you to die.
[01:19:32.756 --> 01:19:34.437]  And I already know that.
[01:19:35.017 --> 01:19:39.320]  But you have to understand they've converted way down low in the pyramid now.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.421]  This was pretty high up in it.
[01:19:41.101 --> 01:19:44.344]  Their own people were the average leftist knows they're depopulating.
[01:19:44.844 --> 01:19:50.167]  They know they're going to take over and sack the cities and take over your houses and businesses like Venezuela.
[01:19:50.588 --> 01:19:59.053]  They are looking forward to that strutting around in your house, demanding sex with your wife, demanding your food, demanding your business.
[01:19:59.474 --> 01:19:59.674]  I mean,
[01:20:02.095 --> 01:20:21.028]  That dog ain't gonna hunt here with 400 million firearms, but they don't care, because we've put up with it so far, because discretion's the better part of valor, as they say, but... Talk about sticking your pecker in a light socket, that's what they're doing.
[01:20:22.468 --> 01:20:26.171]  So it's a very, very, very, very dangerous time.
[01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:30.796]  But they're like, we're criminals, we're gonna destroy you.
[01:20:31.176 --> 01:20:33.277]  I'm like, you didn't think I knew that?
[01:20:35.518 --> 01:20:37.940]  You met with me to tell me you're evil?
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:50.026]  I mean, it's not even... And then I like these detractors out there that are little minions that don't know what's going on.
[01:20:50.386 --> 01:20:52.467]  They attack us on senselessness.
[01:20:55.029 --> 01:20:59.473]  This whole system, Hollywood, the left, the dollar, it's going bye-bye.
[01:20:59.914 --> 01:21:02.076]  This country is going to be a death zone.
[01:21:04.478 --> 01:21:09.382]  But the minions don't care about being destroyed, they just want to imagine that they're the winners.
[01:21:09.663 --> 01:21:10.824]  It's like a video game.
[01:21:12.352 --> 01:21:22.975]  And they just know on Twitter, or Facebook, or YouTube, or Google, or Apple, or wherever, or Reddit, if they attack America and attack truth and justice, they just know they're allowed to post.
[01:21:23.275 --> 01:21:24.815]  They're not even getting money or power.
[01:21:25.015 --> 01:21:30.856]  They just want a LARP, live action role play, that they're in charge, and they're not.
[01:21:34.137 --> 01:21:36.978]  So this is a spiritual crisis, and everybody knows it.
[01:21:38.015 --> 01:21:43.700]  But I've got next hour, we'll take your calls, but also have just coming in today in Austin, just where I live.
[01:21:45.481 --> 01:21:53.849]  Every five minutes they come in and give me a new article of another restaurant, another hotel, another wedding venue.
[01:21:55.373 --> 01:22:15.209]  Where you can't go if you're not injected with this poison they call a vaccine, and if you don't accept this medical ID, and because they say we want to keep everyone safe, even though when you take the shot it makes you create mutants, and makes you shed, and actually, you're admittedly who's making everyone sick, they don't care, and guess what?
[01:22:15.609 --> 01:22:18.391]  I looked at the business owners, and I love women.
[01:22:20.113 --> 01:22:21.274]  Go to my house, that's all there is.
[01:22:22.622 --> 01:22:25.985]  My son's 18, he's moved out, and I'm sitting there with my wife and a bunch of women.
[01:22:26.806 --> 01:22:28.107]  That's who I hang out with is women.
[01:22:28.188 --> 01:22:28.848]  I love women!
[01:22:31.691 --> 01:22:35.755]  But do you know who every person in Austin is shutting their business down unless you take a shot?
[01:22:35.815 --> 01:22:36.216]  It's women.
[01:22:36.896 --> 01:22:42.762]  Who want to be impregnated psychically by Bill Gates, and by Fauci, and by Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:22:42.862 --> 01:22:43.203]  It's what it is.
[01:22:43.483 --> 01:22:44.424]  This is all an Epstein plan.
[01:22:46.584 --> 01:22:49.585]  And they just, they want to have the foreign stuff put in them.
[01:22:49.825 --> 01:22:51.306]  They want the dead baby DNA.
[01:22:51.786 --> 01:22:53.066]  They want the jellyfish DNA.
[01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:54.406]  They want the prions.
[01:22:54.426 --> 01:22:59.328]  They're like, it's a thrill to them because their dads were so nice to them, their brothers were so nice.
[01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:02.229]  They want a bad boy that'll slap them around a little bit.
[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:09.054]  They're gonna slap you around too, and they're just turned over to Satan with a Jezebel spirit, and it's a whole stack of women.
[01:23:09.754 --> 01:23:10.275]  Well, good!
[01:23:10.675 --> 01:23:11.335]  Please!
[01:23:12.216 --> 01:23:14.157]  Please don't let me in your business!
[01:23:14.497 --> 01:23:15.118]  Please!
[01:23:15.478 --> 01:23:18.380]  So I'll never give you... I mean, this is a good thing!
[01:23:19.321 --> 01:23:23.704]  Evil's trying to make us join it by raping us!
[01:23:25.615 --> 01:23:26.976]  And trying to force it on us.
[01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:30.437]  Like, oh, we'll withdraw Target and Walmart.
[01:23:30.717 --> 01:23:32.178]  We'll withdraw Amazon.
[01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:34.019]  We'll withdraw the airplanes.
[01:23:34.339 --> 01:23:37.360]  We'll withdraw if you don't take this poison.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:43.102]  Because they're trying to make you get in bed with them genetically, literally, in your body.
[01:23:44.383 --> 01:23:44.863]  Spiritual.
[01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:45.964]  It's a satanic rape.
[01:23:46.984 --> 01:23:53.607]  And I'm like, thank God you're telling me you want me to stick some dirty needle in me from some psychotic Bill Gates and Fauci
[01:23:54.853 --> 01:23:55.393]  I'm done!
[01:23:55.673 --> 01:23:55.994]  Good!
[01:23:56.294 --> 01:23:57.554]  PLEASE!
[01:23:59.195 --> 01:24:00.135]  And they want our children.
[01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:01.196]  They want them to wear masks.
[01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:02.697]  They say they're murderers if they don't.
[01:24:03.857 --> 01:24:08.619]  And they want us to let them run every facet of our lives.
[01:24:12.921 --> 01:24:15.803]  Because they're people that gave themselves over to rape.
[01:24:16.363 --> 01:24:18.144]  That gave themselves over to globalist control.
[01:24:19.901 --> 01:24:34.388]  And now they just think the Valhalla's coming, I'm virtue signaling, I've got the app, I want you to show you've had this shot that doesn't protect you, and then they'll just take more and more and more because they're spiritually dead, and because they are wedded to the state.
[01:24:36.449 --> 01:24:43.793]  They're the women, they're the boss, and the state told them women are the boss, because the state targeted women knowing they're the most compliant.
[01:24:45.796 --> 01:24:55.879]  So just like these wonderful women fighting back against tyranny, and I'll play some clips of coming up next hour, Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[01:24:55.899 --> 01:24:59.580]  Because 80% of advertising targets women.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.721]  It did then, it does now.
[01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:03.542]  Because men do what women want, and children do what women want.
[01:25:03.562 --> 01:25:04.142]  We love women!
[01:25:05.745 --> 01:25:11.029]  But if the state can come in and get that relationship with your wife or girlfriend, they got everything.
[01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:12.690]  And they want us all dead.
[01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:14.552]  I'm going to go to break separately.
[01:25:15.232 --> 01:25:23.018]  The toothpaste has been sold out for six months, more or longer, because of COVID lockdowns and because of the supply chain breakdown.
[01:25:23.038 --> 01:25:25.160]  Not because of the virus, but because of the global stack.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.862]  We have all these great organic high-end ingredients.
[01:25:28.142 --> 01:25:29.543]  But our activated charcoal,
[01:25:30.771 --> 01:25:42.984]  Gently cleanses teeth, freshens breath, an animal's safe, real peppermint, and more essential oils from Dr. Jones Naturals is exclusively available at InfoWarStore.com right now.
[01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:47.489]  And also, my dad's website is over at Dennis, who developed it.

[01:25:49.912 --> 01:25:51.093]  InfoWarStore.com, it's $9.95.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.722]  Essential oil, activated charcoal mouthwash, people love so much, they're begging for it.
[01:25:58.842 --> 01:26:02.323]  It's back in stock, and that's great, because we got product, we can now fund ourselves.

[01:26:21.289 --> 01:26:23.130]  That's going to end by the end of this weekend.
[01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:31.494]  But the new sale running for a week is Pure Turmeric Concentrated Extract for your immune system and for inflammation, your joints and more.
[01:26:31.894 --> 01:26:34.515]  This great, super strong turmeric extract is in.

[01:27:01.187 --> 01:27:07.790]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[01:27:08.683 --> 01:27:10.247]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:27:10.988 --> 01:27:14.496]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[01:27:16.502 --> 01:27:24.286]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.

[01:27:52.062 --> 01:27:53.383]  Thank you and God bless.
[01:27:53.403 --> 01:28:00.286]  Alright, I'm going to give the number out and hit all the big news coming up next segment, but here's part of the special report.
[01:28:00.807 --> 01:28:02.988]  A desperate message from the real medical community.
[01:28:04.224 --> 01:28:07.206]  There is a clear message that is coming through.
[01:28:07.887 --> 01:28:11.149]  This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:28:11.269 --> 01:28:17.414]  Scientific evidence, experts say, proves fully vaccinated people are protected in two ways.
[01:28:17.534 --> 01:28:22.998]  Essentially, vaccines block you from getting and giving the virus.
[01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:24.199]  I want to be clear.
[01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:28.823]  While vaccinated people can spread the virus if they get a breakthrough infection,
[01:28:29.443 --> 01:28:40.473]  The fact that vaccinated people who do have a breakthrough infection are clearly capable of transmitting the infection to an uninfected person.
[01:28:40.813 --> 01:28:44.137]  Why are the doctors not here in the briefing room to take our questions?
[01:28:44.357 --> 01:28:45.498]  You know what, Kellyo?
[01:28:45.758 --> 01:28:51.083]  I would argue that we had the President of the United States speak to us yesterday.
[01:28:51.263 --> 01:28:55.507]  He gave a more than 30-minute speech about where we are as a country.
[01:28:55.527 --> 01:28:58.109]  I mean, he is a trusted voice.
[01:28:58.189 --> 01:29:00.551]  He is the leader of our country.
[01:29:01.411 --> 01:29:03.333]  No, but we heard from him, right?
[01:29:03.433 --> 01:29:04.894]  We heard from the president yesterday.
[01:29:04.934 --> 01:29:09.218]  We heard from the president about the Delta variant and vaccinations in general.
[01:29:09.498 --> 01:29:14.462]  We have roughly 350 million people vaccinated in the United States.
[01:29:15.903 --> 01:29:18.846]  I'm actually quite proud
[01:29:20.075 --> 01:29:30.100]  ...of the medical services from Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia.
[01:29:31.481 --> 01:29:42.526]  The vast majority of the people speaking up who are doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and nurses are saying the vaccines don't work and are killing most people and the statistics show that.
[01:29:43.326 --> 01:29:51.894]  I'm a Mayo Clinic-trained, board-certified pathologist, board-certified in anatomic and clinical pathology, so yes, I have expertise in immunology and virology.
[01:29:52.475 --> 01:29:53.536]  This is where we are right now.
[01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:55.437]  So does that look like a pandemic?
[01:29:55.597 --> 01:29:56.058]  It was.
[01:29:56.418 --> 01:29:57.279]  It's not anymore.
[01:29:57.339 --> 01:29:58.940]  We are in an endemic now.
[01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:01.002]  Statistically, the pandemic is over in Idaho.
[01:30:01.843 --> 01:30:07.465]  You, statistically, once we're below a set percentage, we are not in a pandemic right now.
[01:30:07.965 --> 01:30:08.826]  Is the disease present?
[01:30:08.886 --> 01:30:09.406]  Sure it is.
[01:30:09.586 --> 01:30:10.326]  Is it widespread?
[01:30:10.346 --> 01:30:10.386]  No.
[01:30:10.507 --> 01:30:14.688]  You know, we're still doing maybe 500 to 600 patient tests a day.
[01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:17.369]  At most, we're seeing 2% per day right now.
[01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.970]  And so, the numbers are going way down.
[01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:23.832]  Their numbers are still high in a few states, but we're getting past that point.
[01:30:24.372 --> 01:30:24.832]  And here's why.
[01:30:24.912 --> 01:30:26.373]  Coronaviruses are seasonal.
[01:30:26.633 --> 01:30:32.296]  They follow a six to nine month life cycle, and no matter what we do, they're going to do what they do, and then they're going to fade.
[01:30:32.736 --> 01:30:33.657]  What happened to SARS?
[01:30:33.717 --> 01:30:34.577]  What happened to MERS?
[01:30:34.617 --> 01:30:36.318]  What did we do to stop them?
[01:30:36.659 --> 01:30:36.999]  Nothing.
[01:30:37.479 --> 01:30:38.299]  They did their thing.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.582]  Average COVID-19 death age, 78.6.
[01:30:43.442 --> 01:30:45.483]  Average age of death in North America every year, 78.6.
[01:30:46.924 --> 01:30:48.805]  What are our highest risk factors?
[01:30:49.766 --> 01:30:53.288]  Obesity, low vitamin D levels, advanced age.
[01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:57.450]  90% of deaths in the state have been over 70 years of age.
[01:30:58.031 --> 01:30:59.532]  That's the at-risk population.
[01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:04.996]  We have stopped our society for something that's taking people that are already at that death risk age anyway.
[01:31:05.736 --> 01:31:06.917]  The virus is fragile.
[01:31:07.097 --> 01:31:08.078]  These are just little tidbits.
[01:31:08.138 --> 01:31:08.638]  It's fragile.
[01:31:08.918 --> 01:31:09.939]  It doesn't live outside.
[01:31:10.079 --> 01:31:12.761]  UV light fractionates it, kills it, blows it apart.
[01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:15.203]  Ventilation in the wind blows it away.
[01:31:15.443 --> 01:31:17.625]  It is insanity to wear a mask outside.
[01:31:17.765 --> 01:31:19.226]  It is absolute insanity.
[01:31:22.048 --> 01:31:23.149]  And that's science.
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:24.171]  That's science.
[01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:28.856]  There is not one study that has shown any super spreader event to have occurred outside.
[01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:31.359]  They have all been indoors with poor ventilation.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:33.501]  I just think that we're kidding ourselves.
[01:31:33.562 --> 01:31:37.206]  If we think kids wearing masks helps, it probably even makes it worse.
[01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:44.571]  You should also know that no vaccine, even the ones I support and would give to myself and my children, ever stops infection.
[01:31:45.111 --> 01:31:48.433]  In 2014, there was outbreak of mumps in the National Hockey League.
[01:31:48.953 --> 01:31:53.196]  The only people who came down with symptoms were the people who were unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status.
[01:31:53.236 --> 01:31:56.938]  Boy, that sounds like a great argument for vaccines, but a question you should ask yourself.
[01:31:57.479 --> 01:32:05.324]  Knowing that half of the people who came down with symptomatic disease had no contact with an unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status individual,
[01:32:06.124 --> 01:32:07.524]  Where did they get the disease?
[01:32:08.385 --> 01:32:11.286]  And the answer was, from the vaccinated individuals.
[01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.347]  No vaccine prevents you from getting infection.
[01:32:14.547 --> 01:32:16.907]  You get infected, you shed pathogen.
[01:32:17.068 --> 01:32:19.648]  This is especially true of viral respiratory pathogens.
[01:32:20.188 --> 01:32:21.789]  You just don't get symptomatic from it.
[01:32:22.289 --> 01:32:27.871]  So you cannot stop spread, you cannot make these numbers that you've planned on get better by doing any of the things you're doing.
[01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:31.256]  Because that is the nature of viral respiratory pathogens.
[01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:36.103]  And you can't prevent it with a vaccine because they don't do the very thing you're wanting them to do.
[01:32:36.704 --> 01:32:39.688]  We are now back in hour number three.
[01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:43.494]  I'm about to give the number out to take your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:44.923 --> 01:32:46.584]  Well, we have a lot of chilling developments.
[01:32:46.624 --> 01:32:48.346]  I was talking about positive things that have been happening.
[01:32:48.366 --> 01:32:49.527]  I'll get more into that in a second.
[01:32:50.147 --> 01:32:55.972]  But you've seen Puppet Biden come out yesterday and say, I may issue national mandates on masks.
[01:32:56.032 --> 01:32:58.894]  I may issue national mandates on stay at home.
[01:32:58.934 --> 01:33:00.075]  All that same kind of crap.
[01:33:00.815 --> 01:33:03.538]  This is the day, from our sources, they were looking at doing it.
[01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.859]  I said they're looking at doing it.
[01:33:05.299 --> 01:33:06.920]  I did not say they would do it today.
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:12.284]  In fact, talking about it backs them off because they don't want to legitimize what we're saying.
[01:33:12.445 --> 01:33:13.405]  So I'd love to
[01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:15.990]  Basically put them off balance.
[01:33:17.531 --> 01:33:18.752]  This is out of Fox News.
[01:33:19.272 --> 01:33:26.275]  Judge grants Dallas County authority to issue mask mandates in defiance of Governor Abbott's order.
[01:33:27.655 --> 01:33:30.256]  So now we have these petty judges in the blue cities.
[01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:33.778]  Every major city in Texas is now Democrat control.
[01:33:34.298 --> 01:33:44.022]  Judge grants Dallas County, that's the county Dallas is in, where I'm from, where I was born, the authority to issue mask mandates in defiance of Governor Abbott's order.
[01:33:45.347 --> 01:33:51.609]  A Dallas judge has ordered Greg Abbott's ban on mask mandates does not help combat the pandemic.
[01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:54.130]  So the judge is a doctor now.
[01:33:54.971 --> 01:34:00.653]  A Dallas judge has ruled Governor Abbott's ban on mask mandates does not help combat the pandemic.
[01:34:01.173 --> 01:34:08.736]  It grants Dallas County the authority, at least for now, to go ahead and defy the governor's order to require masks, which do nothing.
[01:34:10.137 --> 01:34:14.659]  A group of Texas parents is fighting to give school districts the power to issue mask mandates.
[01:34:14.979 --> 01:34:19.901]  Yeah, you got the other parents who want your kid wearing a mask that psychologically totally screws them up.
[01:34:21.042 --> 01:34:25.043]  Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declares he has the authority as well.
[01:34:25.123 --> 01:34:28.065]  That guy's always pushing BLM crap, you name it.
[01:34:28.705 --> 01:34:36.388]  The power struggle between state and local governments continued inside Dallas County Civil Court Tuesday in Judge Tonya Parker's courtroom.
[01:34:36.768 --> 01:34:38.409]  These are the same judges that have been shutting down
[01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:44.058]  People that cut hair for a year.
[01:34:44.118 --> 01:34:44.898]  They're going bankrupt.
[01:34:44.978 --> 01:34:45.959]  You're not essential.
[01:34:46.019 --> 01:34:46.620]  Walmart?
[01:34:48.241 --> 01:34:48.821]  They're open.
[01:34:48.841 --> 01:34:49.922]  The grocery store's open.
[01:34:50.903 --> 01:34:52.164]  The power company's open.
[01:34:52.204 --> 01:34:53.185]  The hospital's open.
[01:34:53.265 --> 01:34:54.426]  You're not essential.
[01:34:55.066 --> 01:34:56.547]  People don't need to have their hair done.
[01:34:56.567 --> 01:35:00.070]  You just need to go bankrupt and shut up and lose your house and live on the street.
[01:35:02.172 --> 01:35:03.893]  Meanwhile, I'll talk about the abuse of children.
[01:35:03.913 --> 01:35:05.574]  Let's hit this right now and I'll give the number up.
[01:35:08.356 --> 01:35:10.258]  The left has always targeted children.
[01:35:11.323 --> 01:35:13.204]  It's what they do, it's what they're obsessed with.
[01:35:13.964 --> 01:35:17.166]  They are predators that want our life force, that want our future.
[01:35:18.086 --> 01:35:34.435]  But if they can't abort them in the mother, they want to try to poison them and dumb them down culturally, and then get them to cut their genitals off, their breasts off, with a transgender, transhumanist agenda that statistically causes the highest levels of disease and suicide.
[01:35:36.681 --> 01:35:38.362]  Here it is out of Axios.
[01:35:38.482 --> 01:35:43.784]  CDC urges pregnant people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
[01:35:45.105 --> 01:35:46.985]  It's not authorized for anybody.
[01:35:47.045 --> 01:35:48.946]  It's an emergency injection.
[01:35:51.367 --> 01:35:57.330]  And they can't even get it authorized from the FDA for the military or under 12.
[01:36:01.943 --> 01:36:04.724]  So they go, hey, we don't count a baby inside the womb as a human.
[01:36:05.504 --> 01:36:08.984]  We urge women to take this, even though it's a genetic therapy.
[01:36:09.544 --> 01:36:28.488]  And in a New England Journal of Medicine study, 80 plus percent of the women who were in the first trimester who took the shot of the GMO lost their baby.
[01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:31.895]  Now, you think about diabolical evil.
[01:36:31.935 --> 01:36:35.317]  They are seeing us as animals, seeing us as overpopulated.
[01:36:35.537 --> 01:36:39.020]  They're pretending like they're a superclass above us, a new species of globalists.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.461]  They're like aliens, they think.
[01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.723]  And they're gonna order us to kill our babies.
[01:36:45.224 --> 01:36:48.466]  And call our children terrorists and say, do all this crap.
[01:36:50.288 --> 01:36:51.068]  Truly evil, man.
[01:36:51.729 --> 01:36:54.671]  And here it is, Oklahoma School Board, InfoWars.com article member.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:03.684]  Again, Oklahoma School Board member says maskless children will commit murder in push for school mask mandate.
[01:37:03.704 --> 01:37:08.266]  Democrats are calling for it to be considered premeditated murder, not to wear a mask.
[01:37:11.087 --> 01:37:12.628]  Who'd ever think they'd come up with something like this?
[01:37:12.648 --> 01:37:13.348]  So nonsensical.
[01:37:13.608 --> 01:37:17.690]  But that's how the PSYOPs, behavioral psychologists, run all of this.
[01:37:17.710 --> 01:37:24.473]  82% of pregnant women who got vaccinated for COVID during first, second trimester suffered miscarriage.
[01:37:25.984 --> 01:37:27.025]  New England Medical Journal.
[01:37:29.606 --> 01:37:30.707]  Here's another big article out.
[01:37:30.767 --> 01:37:41.012]  Pediatricians masking and social distancing impacting child development, causing depression, causing neuroses, causing all different forms of mental illness.
[01:37:41.612 --> 01:37:43.553]  That's at Pittsburgh CBS News.
[01:37:44.914 --> 01:37:47.235]  Playing with your peers is an important part of child development.
[01:37:47.476 --> 01:37:50.597]  However, kids aren't socializing as much through the pandemic.
[01:37:50.917 --> 01:37:52.098]  I mean, the made-up fear-mongering.
[01:37:52.678 --> 01:37:55.280]  Which doctors say is leading to concerning outcomes.
[01:37:56.786 --> 01:37:58.287]  You've seen language delays.
[01:37:58.687 --> 01:37:59.828]  Oh, language delays.
[01:38:00.448 --> 01:38:01.789]  And more social anxiety.
[01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:06.611]  Inability of a child to leave their parent or go play with other children.
[01:38:07.692 --> 01:38:08.452]  And it goes on.
[01:38:08.552 --> 01:38:08.873]  Yes.
[01:38:09.433 --> 01:38:10.373]  Mass suicides.
[01:38:14.256 --> 01:38:16.037]  We got another report we haven't gotten to.
[01:38:17.077 --> 01:38:21.700]  The COVID sheep under martial law.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.180]  That's coming up.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:23.841]  We're going to get that.
[01:38:26.257 --> 01:38:27.758]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:38:30.239 --> 01:38:31.120]  But here's CNN.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:36.662]  Here's why now is one of the most dangerous times of the pandemic for our children.
[01:38:37.243 --> 01:38:39.164]  But wait a minute, I thought they're little terrorists.
[01:38:39.204 --> 01:38:42.085]  I mean, I thought they're, I thought they're murderers.
[01:38:44.366 --> 01:38:45.207]  All of it's a lie.
[01:38:46.007 --> 01:38:46.848]  All of it's a fraud.
[01:38:46.928 --> 01:38:52.571]  Almost every infection and death out there, and it's horrible right now, is from sloughing
[01:38:53.666 --> 01:38:58.690]  And they admit in the studies, yes, that's the majority of it, and it's creating new mutants and new viruses.
[01:38:58.730 --> 01:39:06.656]  So, they came up with a mutated virus, which they basically create an autoimmune response to the body.
[01:39:07.396 --> 01:39:14.321]  It programs the body to make the virus, and they claim that's a counter, even though all the scientists went, that'll actually kill everybody.
[01:39:14.722 --> 01:39:15.702]  They went, shut up!
[01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:19.005]  Google doesn't let you talk about it, either it's Facebook or Twitter.
[01:39:19.935 --> 01:39:20.935]  Oh, want to have a Senate hearing?
[01:39:20.975 --> 01:39:21.816]  We're not going to let you see it.
[01:39:22.136 --> 01:39:23.657]  Because it's a military attack.
[01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:26.158]  It's a biological weapon attack.
[01:39:26.518 --> 01:39:27.678]  It's the New World Order.
[01:39:28.239 --> 01:39:29.019]  It's taken over.
[01:39:29.559 --> 01:39:30.139]  It's attacking.
[01:39:30.379 --> 01:39:33.461]  And now it's saying, we need to arrest people that criticize Fauci.
[01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:35.021]  And that passed in the stimulus bill.
[01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:36.302]  Let's see him implement it.
[01:39:36.742 --> 01:39:40.584]  We need to shut down people like Senator Paul that don't agree with us.
[01:39:42.108 --> 01:39:42.848]  There's another story.
[01:39:43.188 --> 01:39:44.749]  CNN medical propagandists.
[01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:47.690]  Kids in schools need industrial-grade masks.
[01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:55.034]  Weekly test, says the former head of Planned Parenthood, whose, again, main job was to make sure to kill as many American children as she could.
[01:39:57.695 --> 01:40:01.096]  She killed more Americans than Hitler did in all of World War II every year.
[01:40:01.636 --> 01:40:05.238]  And now her job is, because she loves life so much, is getting a shot in your arm.
[01:40:09.997 --> 01:40:17.080]  Meanwhile, third grade lessons on Virginia's state education website appears to glorify communism.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.341]  Well, of course it's a communist takeover.
[01:40:20.622 --> 01:40:26.444]  Atlanta mother shocked to discover child's elementary school segregated classes by race and the school confirmed it.
[01:40:26.804 --> 01:40:28.745]  Well, yeah, we got to separate these evil whites.
[01:40:29.986 --> 01:40:33.147]  Your children are in an open air re-education camp.
[01:40:36.089 --> 01:40:41.873]  Folks have found a video, a national TV show I was part of, 11 years ago, exposing the plan to put us in camps.
[01:40:42.694 --> 01:40:46.677]  I'm going to hit that at the start of the next hour before our special guest takes over.
[01:40:48.118 --> 01:40:50.860]  But when I come back, I'm going to take your calls.
[01:40:53.282 --> 01:40:54.983]  And I'm going to hit some other positive news.
[01:40:55.003 --> 01:40:56.504]  This mother fighting back in Virginia.
[01:40:57.185 --> 01:41:02.709]  And I've got just where I live, all the different restaurants and venues saying, no GMO injection and proof of it.
[01:41:04.445 --> 01:41:06.246]  Let me know your medical record before you can have a wedding here.
[01:41:06.406 --> 01:41:08.087]  Let me know your medical record before you go in this restaurant.
[01:41:08.488 --> 01:41:09.528]  Just think about that.
[01:41:10.069 --> 01:41:10.709]  And it's happening.
[01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:14.932]  And see, you have this normalcy bias, like, oh, it couldn't happen.
[01:41:14.952 --> 01:41:16.993]  But it is, you see, because it's real.
[01:41:17.914 --> 01:41:21.116]  They have a plan by next year to start putting people in FEMA camps in America.
[01:41:21.396 --> 01:41:21.976]  It's official.
[01:41:22.016 --> 01:41:23.277]  I have the CDC's on the mission.
[01:41:23.657 --> 01:41:24.598]  I'll tell you about that as well.
[01:41:24.638 --> 01:41:27.920]  But first, the toll-free number to join us is 877-422-9000.
[01:41:30.077 --> 01:41:30.197]  789-2539-877-789-2539.
[01:41:30.338 --> 01:41:32.582]  What do you make of the move against our children?
[01:41:32.682 --> 01:41:33.744]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:41:38.783 --> 01:41:40.644]  What has been your experience with vaccines?
[01:41:41.424 --> 01:41:43.704]  And how do you think we should peacefully fight back?
[01:41:43.744 --> 01:41:44.945]  And what are you doing to fight back?
[01:41:45.025 --> 01:41:45.805]  I want to hear from you.
[01:41:46.185 --> 01:41:46.945]  You are the people.
[01:41:47.005 --> 01:41:47.846]  You are the resistance.
[01:41:48.266 --> 01:41:50.286]  You are damn beautiful, made by God.
[01:41:50.966 --> 01:41:52.467]  You all got red blood and I love you.
[01:41:53.047 --> 01:41:53.967]  Your heart loves liberty.
[01:41:54.487 --> 01:41:55.448]  I love you so much.
[01:41:55.488 --> 01:42:02.089]  If you've got the most ebony black skin or the most snow white skin, I don't, brown skin, I don't give a damn about your skin.
[01:42:02.129 --> 01:42:03.470]  I care about your soul and your heart.
[01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:05.891]  And if you love liberty, like I do, I love you.
[01:42:05.971 --> 01:42:07.431]  And I want you to know I commit,
[01:42:07.691 --> 01:42:09.832]  To you to fight these suckers as hard as I can.
[01:42:10.092 --> 01:42:13.214]  We're going to win together.
[01:42:13.234 --> 01:42:13.494]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:14.815 --> 01:42:26.001]  Well, in about seven seconds, most telephones and cable TV radio systems will be taken over by FEMA and President Joe Biden in a martial law drill.
[01:42:27.522 --> 01:42:27.722]  That's 1220.
[01:42:34.039 --> 01:42:34.219]  Yep.
[01:42:34.339 --> 01:42:36.661]  So, folks, tell us what you see.
[01:42:36.761 --> 01:42:39.963]  Tell us what you see unfolding and going on.
[01:42:40.043 --> 01:42:41.484]  But maybe he's going to postpone it.
[01:42:41.504 --> 01:42:43.805]  They did announce all these big announcements for today.
[01:42:43.845 --> 01:42:45.086]  They had the White House ready for it.
[01:42:45.927 --> 01:42:48.829]  But a lot of times politicians are 20, 30 minutes late.
[01:42:49.269 --> 01:42:51.951]  So we'll watch that as it all unfolds.
[01:42:53.332 --> 01:42:54.152]  I love this graphic.
[01:42:54.212 --> 01:42:54.993]  I love this meme.
[01:42:55.433 --> 01:42:58.395]  I'm sure Twitter will ban it because you're not allowed to criticize the takeover.
[01:43:00.623 --> 01:43:06.868]  But it's a man looking at an old-fashioned box trap, the type I would use to catch birds and squirrels, just because I thought it was cool.
[01:43:07.128 --> 01:43:09.370]  I let him go once we did it when I was a child.
[01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:14.394]  And you just put a rope to it, hide in the shed, hide in the tent, hide behind the bushes.
[01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.856]  The squirrel or rabbit or bird gets in there.
[01:43:17.497 --> 01:43:19.058]  You pull the stick and it falls on him.
[01:43:19.399 --> 01:43:20.499]  Well, it says Freedom Pass.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.982]  Does he want to climb under there and do that?
[01:43:23.022 --> 01:43:25.744]  I mean, this is ridiculously obvious.
[01:43:29.738 --> 01:43:31.279]  This is a total takeover.
[01:43:31.779 --> 01:43:33.379]  Let's play this Pentagon clip first.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:45.504]  I remember again in mainline Pentagon documents 25 years ago about we've been tasked by DARPA and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as the Carnegie Foundation to end war.
[01:43:46.184 --> 01:43:49.265]  To end war we must end the family and the human mammal dynamic.
[01:43:49.765 --> 01:43:51.746]  We have a plan to put humans in tanks
[01:43:52.406 --> 01:43:55.587]  From birth with virtual reality once computer systems are up to that level.
[01:43:56.007 --> 01:44:03.990]  Where people will live in peace and we'll be able to have a mainframe computer that guides them through life and the power of their own heat will run the computers.
[01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:06.550]  That was a theoretical DARPA plan from 1977.
[01:44:06.810 --> 01:44:10.111]  They made the movie The Matrix out of it.
[01:44:10.151 --> 01:44:11.432]  Yep, they're doing the EAS right now.
[01:44:12.992 --> 01:44:16.976]  I guess they've, uh, National Periodic Test EAS Emergency Alert System.
[01:44:17.016 --> 01:44:17.377]  There it is.
[01:44:17.397 --> 01:44:21.041]  It's taking off.
[01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.303]  Keep going with it.
[01:44:25.445 --> 01:44:25.986]  Oh, that's right.
[01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:26.947]  The engineers are telling us.
[01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:27.668]  Hold on.
[01:44:27.708 --> 01:44:29.270]  We can't air the tones.
[01:44:31.018 --> 01:44:34.939]  If we air the tones, that can take over the scramblers of the radio station.
[01:44:35.499 --> 01:44:36.539]  But that's not the tones.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:42.681]  That's the old system that would launch tones to take over the radio or TV station.
[01:44:44.121 --> 01:44:48.122]  Now they don't need the tones because they're hardwired and everything, but I won't explain it to the engineers.
[01:44:48.942 --> 01:44:50.783]  Anyways, the point is, is that
[01:44:52.896 --> 01:44:54.077]  You can show the image of it.
[01:44:54.517 --> 01:44:56.738]  I don't know who told you you can't show that, but that's not the case.
[01:44:57.479 --> 01:45:00.781]  I'm not mad at anybody, but my God, what a broke back country.
[01:45:00.981 --> 01:45:02.843]  We can't even show you the emergency alert.
[01:45:03.083 --> 01:45:04.064]  Okay, it doesn't exist.
[01:45:04.084 --> 01:45:04.664]  Great, it didn't happen.
[01:45:05.084 --> 01:45:07.046]  I mean, I'm walking off at this point.
[01:45:07.186 --> 01:45:10.808]  I mean, it's like I live in a twilight zone.
[01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:13.070]  It's like a year and a half ago during the lockdown.
[01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:14.971]  I told you it's all BS.
[01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:16.132]  We're an essential company.
[01:45:16.412 --> 01:45:17.093]  We can stay open.
[01:45:17.113 --> 01:45:17.633]  No one believed me.
[01:45:17.653 --> 01:45:18.934]  It took me weeks to convince anybody of it.
[01:45:19.714 --> 01:45:20.135]  I'm not mad.
[01:45:21.735 --> 01:45:22.135]  I'm not mad.
[01:45:22.155 --> 01:45:23.095]  Let's go to rebroadcast though.
[01:45:23.676 --> 01:45:24.296]  What do we got here?
[01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:24.896]  What do we got here?
[01:45:25.696 --> 01:45:29.317]  Am I allowed to show a video off this, uh, of my show?
[01:45:29.897 --> 01:45:30.797]  Am I allowed to even be on air?
[01:45:31.138 --> 01:45:31.758]  Probably not.
[01:45:32.518 --> 01:45:33.078]  Nothing's allowed.
[01:45:33.258 --> 01:45:33.958]  I'm so free!
[01:45:34.899 --> 01:45:36.099]  Rand Paul can't talk!
[01:45:36.759 --> 01:45:37.519]  No one can talk!
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:39.560]  Air whatever you want.
[01:45:45.892 --> 01:45:58.426]  While King Obama attempts to divert the public from interrupting his sophisticated celebration of elitists flaunting their disregard of their own totalitarian COVID orders upon the peasants.
[01:45:58.606 --> 01:45:59.687]  This is going to be safe.
[01:45:59.847 --> 01:46:01.869]  This is a sophisticated vaccinated crowd.
[01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:04.032]  And this is just about optics.
[01:46:04.092 --> 01:46:04.973]  It's not about safety.
[01:46:05.353 --> 01:46:13.461]  And the bewildered compromise puppet Sleepy Joe can't even manage to remember the amount of people he supposedly presides over.
[01:46:13.862 --> 01:46:18.787]  We have roughly 350 million people vaccinated in the United States.
[01:46:20.471 --> 01:46:24.034]  350 million people vaccinated in the United States, Joe?
[01:46:24.594 --> 01:46:27.757]  The population is only 330 million.
[01:46:28.258 --> 01:46:38.407]  And Dr. Gain of Fauci continues to recklessly lead the spin on what will amount to a violation of the Nuremberg Code of Astronomical Proportions.
[01:46:38.507 --> 01:46:42.731]  There are two things you do with children who are not vaccinated, and that's the recommendation.
[01:46:42.771 --> 01:46:52.319]  You surround them with those who can be vaccinated, whoever they are, teachers, personnel in the school, anyone, get them vaccinated.
[01:46:52.359 --> 01:46:55.081]  So protect the kids with a shield of vaccinated people.
[01:46:55.441 --> 01:47:01.907]  For the kids who can't get vaccinated, that's the reason why we're having a strong recommendation.
[01:47:02.327 --> 01:47:06.568]  That in the schools, everybody should wear a mask, whether or not you're vaccinated.
[01:47:06.689 --> 01:47:19.053]  The vaccine lie continues to float to the surface in countries where the majority of the public is vaccinated, yet COVID is spreading through the vaccinated masses like wildfire.
[01:47:19.653 --> 01:47:25.335]  Iceland's chief epidemiologist admitted that the only way possible to achieve herd immunity
[01:47:25.635 --> 01:47:39.163]  is for the virus to infect 70 to 80 percent of the population and that natural immunity must replace the failed measures of the vaccines by increasing hospital capacity and tightening border restrictions.
[01:47:39.483 --> 01:47:41.825]  The majority of Iceland is vaccinated.
[01:47:42.145 --> 01:47:44.786]  Yet the vaccinated continue to be infected.
[01:47:45.086 --> 01:47:59.993]  In Denmark, the State Serum Institute, Denmark's infectious disease agency, has said it no longer believes it will be possible to achieve herd immunity through vaccination, implying that COVID-19 could circulate for years to come.
[01:48:00.353 --> 01:48:09.739]  But the authorities will not listen to the science, instead preferring totalitarian lockdown measures which will incubate and increase the spread.
[01:48:10.099 --> 01:48:15.843]  UK's travel minister has declared that vaccines will be required to travel forevermore.
[01:48:16.123 --> 01:48:22.707]  While London's globalist mayor, Sadiq Khan, wants to make travelling on a train unmasked illegal.
[01:48:22.987 --> 01:48:26.990]  And Australia will lock down any citizen returning from abroad.
[01:48:27.330 --> 01:48:36.913]  Western civilization is under full-blown assault by a totalitarian soft-kill weapon, dominated by the submissive whims of owned politicians.
[01:48:36.993 --> 01:48:37.733]  What video is this?
[01:48:37.793 --> 01:48:41.254]  Zero knowledge of science, egged on by propaganda.
[01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:45.295]  New vaccine mandates are being rolled out across the country.
[01:48:45.335 --> 01:48:45.955]  Why not?
[01:48:46.775 --> 01:48:58.537]  Some school officials, they're considering vaccine mandates to enact a compulsory, mandatory vaccination law.
[01:48:58.577 --> 01:49:05.619]  He's an advocate for a vaccine mandate for all school employees, while also pushing for mandatory masks for children.
[01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:08.219]  No mask mandates and vaccine mandates.
[01:49:08.259 --> 01:49:13.780]  We've got to push that as a requirement and make sure that we know who is vaccinated.
[01:49:14.241 --> 01:49:18.046]  Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates.
[01:49:18.186 --> 01:49:25.676]  The only way forward is to shut down the border and give center stage to the doctors fighting to break through the censorship.
[01:49:26.117 --> 01:49:27.979]  I'm actually a functional family medicine physician.
[01:49:27.999 --> 01:49:31.284]  That means I am specially trained in immunology and inflammation regulation.
[01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:36.773]  And everything being recommended by the CDC and the State Board of Health is actually contrary to all the rules of science.
[01:49:37.454 --> 01:49:44.180]  So things you should know about coronavirus and all other respiratory viruses, they are spread by aerosol particles, which are small enough to go through every mask.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:56.972]  And I would hope this board would start asking itself, before it considers taking the advice of the CDC, the NIH, and the State Board of Health, why we are doing things about this that we didn't do for the common cold, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus.
[01:49:57.592 --> 01:50:06.736]  And then ask yourself, why is a vaccine that is supposedly so effective having a breakout in the middle of the summer when respiratory viral syndromes don't do that?
[01:50:07.556 --> 01:50:12.058]  And to help you understand that, you need to know the condition that is called antibody-mediated viral enhancement.
[01:50:12.938 --> 01:50:28.103]  That is a condition done when vaccines work wrong, as they did in every coronavirus study done in animals, on coronaviruses after the SARS outbreak, and done in respiratory syncytial virus, where a vaccine used in a vulnerable individual
[01:50:28.943 --> 01:50:31.085]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.185]  I'm going to take your phone calls.
[01:51:00.703 --> 01:51:03.565]  First, I want to air this because I talked about airing it quite a bit today.
[01:51:04.585 --> 01:51:15.132]  The Pentagon is back out announcing that they want implantable microchips to stop COVID and digital passports to buy and sell to stop COVID.
[01:51:16.252 --> 01:51:18.514]  And none of it has anything to do with stopping COVID.
[01:51:18.574 --> 01:51:28.440]  So here's KTLA in California.
[01:51:29.841 --> 01:51:46.181]  The biggest TV station out there saying how cool it is, sort of cool, that you're going to have this biochip in you that is going to monitor and track and control you for the system.
[01:51:47.677 --> 01:51:51.080]  And you've already seen this on 60 Minutes, but that's where all this goes.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.661]  Klaus Schwab has said this is the endgame.
[01:51:53.302 --> 01:51:54.463]  None of this has to do with freedom.
[01:51:54.583 --> 01:51:55.524]  We all know that.
[01:51:56.385 --> 01:51:59.988]  And how do you get sheep who are being targeted by this to figure it out?
[01:52:00.008 --> 01:52:00.969]  You can say, well, screw the sheep.
[01:52:01.009 --> 01:52:02.851]  Let them get destroyed.
[01:52:03.271 --> 01:52:05.293]  They're going to be used as weapons against us.
[01:52:06.474 --> 01:52:08.255]  So to save ourselves, we've got to save them.
[01:52:09.436 --> 01:52:09.797]  Here it is.
[01:52:10.814 --> 01:52:11.695]  This is sort of cool.
[01:52:11.735 --> 01:52:18.340]  Scientists at the Pentagon are developing a microchip that can detect viruses in the blood, including COVID-19.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:24.325]  The chip would be inserted just under the skin and alert the user if the coronavirus is present.
[01:52:24.425 --> 01:52:25.045]  I knew it!
[01:52:25.586 --> 01:52:27.207]  The military has not said.
[01:52:27.227 --> 01:52:28.508]  I knew it was coming.
[01:52:28.828 --> 01:52:29.769]  Has been deployed.
[01:52:30.441 --> 01:52:31.602]  And you see how that works.
[01:52:31.982 --> 01:52:42.348]  Oh, you can either have all the deadly shots we want to give you every month, or you can do a PCR test that's a fraud, or have a microchip in you all the time.
[01:52:42.368 --> 01:52:43.928]  But then there'll be another chip.
[01:52:43.948 --> 01:52:45.649]  Well, we need the chip in your brain.
[01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:48.631]  Always more with these psychos.
[01:52:50.952 --> 01:52:56.275]  And you've got endless people that'll take a paycheck to get up there on these panel shows and make it look like it's normal.
[01:52:57.216 --> 01:52:59.177]  But none of this is normal.
[01:53:01.584 --> 01:53:03.225]  I was watching a CNN clip this morning.
[01:53:03.685 --> 01:53:06.287]  They're like, yes, it's like drunk driving.
[01:53:06.687 --> 01:53:08.868]  It's like you're a terrorist if you don't wear a mask.
[01:53:09.388 --> 01:53:11.609]  And the next, are children terrorists coming up?
[01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:14.651]  And they have all the whole panel go, well, they are terrorists.
[01:53:15.812 --> 01:53:18.033]  See, you're learning how you're a terrorist now.
[01:53:19.534 --> 01:53:21.455]  Wear the mask, the symbol of slavery.
[01:53:24.116 --> 01:53:25.497]  It's just too much, isn't it?
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.227]  And now onto the Communist Takeover program, then we'll go to your calls.
[01:53:32.928 --> 01:53:37.738]  Virginia teacher resigns after ordered to snitch on dissenters of Oak Agenda.
[01:53:37.758 --> 01:53:39.161]  What do you think the Pentagon is now?
[01:53:40.199 --> 01:53:40.860]  The military.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.521]  What is a white supremacist?
[01:53:42.541 --> 01:53:43.962]  They're pro-gun, they're pro-America.
[01:53:44.263 --> 01:53:44.783]  Same thing here.
[01:53:45.183 --> 01:53:49.627]  Oh, did somebody in school criticize hearing that white people are inherently evil?
[01:53:50.348 --> 01:53:51.429]  And that communism's good?
[01:53:51.729 --> 01:53:55.713]  Well, let's suspend them, just like Senator Paul suspended off YouTube.
[01:53:56.033 --> 01:53:59.716]  Why, he said, the masks don't work, which is on the box of the masks.
[01:54:00.998 --> 01:54:03.520]  Let's hear from teacher Laura Morris.
[01:54:06.324 --> 01:54:11.210]  I am privileged to follow my amazing fourth graders up to fifth, and I have been excited about this all summer.
[01:54:12.071 --> 01:54:27.348]  On the other hand, this summer I have struggled with the idea of returning to school, knowing that I'll be working yet again for the school division that, despite its shiny tech and flashy salary, promotes political ideologies that do not square with who I am as a believer in Christ.
[01:54:27.968 --> 01:54:47.868]  After reading about your lack of consideration for the growing population of concerned citizens in this division, clearly evidenced by this empty room tonight where you shut the doors to the public, as well as the emails sent by the superintendent last year, reminded me that a dissenting opinion is not allowed, even to be spoken in my personal life.
[01:54:48.288 --> 01:54:59.312]  Going so far as to send a form to my colleagues and I encouraging us to fill it out if we hear one another speaking against the controversial policy being promoted by this school board and adopted in this county.
[01:54:59.332 --> 01:55:12.097]  Not only that, but within the last year, I was told in one of my so-called equity trainings that white, Christian, able-bodied females currently have the power in our schools and that, quote, this has to change.
[01:55:12.697 --> 01:55:14.119]  Clearly, you've made your point.
[01:55:14.339 --> 01:55:18.164]  You no longer value me or many other teachers you've employed in this county.
[01:55:18.485 --> 01:55:27.436]  So since my contract outlines the power that you have over my employment in Loudoun County Public Schools, I find it necessary to resign in front of you.
[01:55:28.097 --> 01:55:29.319]  School Board, I twitch.
[01:55:29.853 --> 01:55:40.945]  I quit your policies, I quit your training, and I quit being a cog in a machine that tells me to push highly politicized agendas on our most vulnerable constituents, the children.
[01:55:41.505 --> 01:55:43.247]  I will find employment elsewhere.
[01:55:43.307 --> 01:55:47.031]  I encourage all parents and staff in this county to flood the private schools.
[01:55:50.646 --> 01:55:51.806]  And that's who they are.
[01:55:51.946 --> 01:55:54.487]  Bill Gates, the UN, they're in control of everything.
[01:55:55.068 --> 01:55:58.429]  The mayors, most of the police departments, the schools.
[01:55:59.129 --> 01:56:02.610]  They're attacking the police because they're not in full control of the average officer yet.
[01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:04.831]  This isn't a takeover coming.
[01:56:06.171 --> 01:56:08.272]  This is a takeover happening now.
[01:56:08.892 --> 01:56:09.852]  I want to go to Bruno.
[01:56:10.613 --> 01:56:17.195]  I want to go to Josh, Oliver, Joe, Cody, Dana, George, Carlos, and Trish.
[01:56:18.086 --> 01:56:18.947]  Please don't thank me.
[01:56:19.047 --> 01:56:19.687]  I love you too.
[01:56:19.727 --> 01:56:20.808]  Let's just get to the next person.
[01:56:20.828 --> 01:56:22.410]  We won't have time for these calls.
[01:56:23.070 --> 01:56:24.832]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bruno in Florida.
[01:56:25.172 --> 01:56:25.813]  Thanks for calling.
[01:56:25.833 --> 01:56:26.393]  You're on the air.
[01:56:27.994 --> 01:56:28.495]  Hey Alex.
[01:56:28.775 --> 01:56:29.716]  I'm here in Florida.
[01:56:30.076 --> 01:56:32.538]  I thought I was safe from the mass mandate.
[01:56:33.499 --> 01:56:45.149]  My daughter is going to a Christian private school and on Friday, last Friday, I got an email and the school, a Christian private school decided to
[01:56:46.405 --> 01:56:48.847]  Mandate the mask back, uh, indoor.
[01:56:49.987 --> 01:56:50.908]  I'm devastated.
[01:56:51.048 --> 01:57:04.657]  I, whenever I heard the news of school boards going, uh, wanting to put the mask back on our kids again, I was, I was relaxed about it because I thought, okay, my daughter is going to a Christian private school.
[01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:05.918]  It's never going to happen there.
[01:57:06.478 --> 01:57:07.419]  And it just so happened.
[01:57:07.459 --> 01:57:10.221]  And we are here in Florida and that's after the order from
[01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:19.381]  Our governor, DeSantis, prohibiting the schools to... But the cities and the counties and the Democrats and the corporations are saying no.
[01:57:19.421 --> 01:57:20.522]  It's about power, isn't it?
[01:57:21.802 --> 01:57:22.122]  It is.
[01:57:22.403 --> 01:57:34.869]  And just so you know, I talked to the lower principal, personally, not personally, through email, and she told me that the decision came from the Florida Council of Independent Schools.
[01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:43.741]  And then, if you keep asking, like, most of the staff members in the school, they do not agree with this decision.
[01:57:44.141 --> 01:57:46.945]  And they tell me that it was the board, the school board.
[01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:49.903]  And then I ask them, can I meet these people?
[01:57:49.923 --> 01:57:52.605]  Can I offer some arguments?
[01:57:52.866 --> 01:57:53.366]  Well, that's it.
[01:57:53.386 --> 01:57:58.130]  They've got lawyers that scare everybody with lawsuits that run the councils that control people through terror.
[01:57:58.150 --> 01:58:02.353]  You just go talk to school and say, listen, let's all just quietly ignore this.
[01:58:02.554 --> 01:58:04.135]  They'll send out emails saying, spy.
[01:58:04.155 --> 01:58:08.118]  In a communist takeover, everybody has to start ignoring it or they're going to win.
[01:58:08.138 --> 01:58:12.302]  I think the answer is just quietly get the school to not enforce it.
[01:58:13.373 --> 01:58:20.498]  Yeah, I was fortunate enough to be able to get a note from my daughter's doctor saying that she does not require to wear a mask.
[01:58:21.098 --> 01:58:26.862]  My daughter, thank God, is not wearing a mask, but it hurts my heart to see all these little children, four-year-olds,
[01:58:27.307 --> 01:58:28.147]  Yes, he does.
[01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.708]  And I'm trying to be effective.
[01:58:29.728 --> 01:58:32.128]  I'm going to get involved into the school.
[01:58:32.148 --> 01:58:32.288]  Try to
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:55.121]  Wake up these people, like these parents that willfully will cover their child's face.
[01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:56.522]  It makes no sense to me.
[01:58:56.542 --> 01:58:58.222]  Why would you do something like that?
[01:58:58.242 --> 01:58:59.742]  And you need to take them to major studies.
[01:58:59.822 --> 01:59:04.964]  It makes the children think they're dirty and bad and ugly and screws them up bad and makes them unhealthy.
[01:59:05.864 --> 01:59:06.324]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:06.584 --> 01:59:11.325]  But for some reason, all these questions... Alex, let me tell you something, Alex.
[01:59:11.730 --> 01:59:12.711]  I came from Brazil.
[01:59:13.111 --> 01:59:16.214]  Brazil was a great country 57 years ago.
[01:59:16.234 --> 01:59:22.779]  The culture was destroyed by stupid policies that we see now here in the United States.
[01:59:22.879 --> 01:59:26.822]  I'm fighting to save America from becoming a country like Brazil.
[01:59:27.541 --> 01:59:29.342]  And I see everything, like, happening.
[01:59:29.602 --> 01:59:30.802]  It's repeating itself.
[01:59:31.182 --> 01:59:37.725]  Even the war on the culture, the war on the history, American history, trying to separate Americans from their history.
[01:59:38.005 --> 01:59:43.227]  They did all that in Brazil about 50 to 70 years ago, and they were successful.
[01:59:43.507 --> 01:59:45.668]  Brazilians are not patriotic people.
[01:59:46.474 --> 01:59:48.014]  And they're trying to do the same thing here.
[01:59:48.034 --> 01:59:51.295]  They are trying to separate Americans from their history.
[01:59:51.675 --> 01:59:54.055]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[01:59:54.095 --> 01:59:55.316]  Beautifully said, Bruno.
[01:59:55.336 --> 01:59:57.576]  Listen, you're doing a great job and God bless you.
[01:59:58.336 --> 02:00:00.036]  Just protect your daughter and protect others.
[02:00:00.116 --> 02:00:00.476]  Absolutely.
[02:00:00.596 --> 02:00:05.097]  Muzzling our children, saying they're dirty little terrorists if they show their faces.
[02:00:05.117 --> 02:00:05.877]  That's CNN.
[02:00:06.177 --> 02:00:07.278]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:00:08.998 --> 02:00:09.658]  Welcome back.
[02:00:11.058 --> 02:00:14.139]  You know, I was sitting there psychoanalyzing why I got so mad earlier.
[02:00:14.159 --> 02:00:14.819]  It doesn't do with the crew.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:24.287]  And it's that we got an amazing guest host of the fourth hour, a psychiatrist, really well-spoken, gets a lot of medical experts on bombshells.
[02:00:24.327 --> 02:00:29.932]  Last week he was on for an hour and he had this big Pfizer whistleblower on, it was just blood-curdling.
[02:00:30.412 --> 02:00:38.680]  Last time I checked, that interview's got 800,000 views on Banned.video on top of the millions that watched it here, so look forward to Dr. Kaufman next hour.
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:41.642]  But I get frustrated because I've covered
[02:00:43.539 --> 02:00:44.520]  20% of what I was ready to cover.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.380]  And a lot of it's my fault not getting to it all.
[02:00:47.401 --> 02:00:51.322]  So, I'm co-hosting The War with Owen Stroyer today, 3 p.m.
[02:00:51.382 --> 02:00:52.462]  Central, after the next hour.
[02:00:53.022 --> 02:00:54.643]  I called Owen, he wants me on, we're gonna do it.
[02:00:55.343 --> 02:00:56.344]  Let me just show you this real quick.
[02:00:56.384 --> 02:00:57.364]  This is a cool thing we made.
[02:00:58.884 --> 02:01:07.587]  Rob Dew, about a week ago, two weeks ago, said, hey, my buddy is in Pennsylvania, he's at a gas pump, look at this InfoWars sticker.
[02:01:07.667 --> 02:01:08.888]  This is an actual photo.
[02:01:09.878 --> 02:01:13.941]  I can't believe that the key, the way they got keyed, it looks so almost fake.
[02:01:14.902 --> 02:01:20.666]  But that's, we've got the photo of the guy that had keyed this trying to get it off of a gas pump.
[02:01:21.527 --> 02:01:28.472]  And we took a photo of it, and now the bumper stickers, that's one of the new stickers we throw in every order, is the, what are we calling it?
[02:01:28.512 --> 02:01:31.454]  The punished InfoWars sticker.
[02:01:32.375 --> 02:01:35.758]  And that is a blow up of the real photo.
[02:01:37.429 --> 02:01:38.229]  So there you go.
[02:01:38.369 --> 02:01:40.430]  That's kind of how we come up with weird stuff around here.
[02:01:40.450 --> 02:01:41.450]  I think it turned out pretty cool.
[02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:43.951]  Except the scrape marks almost look artificial.
[02:01:45.391 --> 02:01:47.571]  But that's the actual, that's how the person scratched it.
[02:01:47.591 --> 02:01:48.352]  That's what the key did.
[02:01:49.172 --> 02:01:52.933]  So that's that piece of information.
[02:01:53.633 --> 02:01:55.473]  By the way, the toothpaste is back in stock.
[02:01:55.493 --> 02:01:59.954]  The charcoal, activated charcoal with real peppermint.
[02:02:00.014 --> 02:02:00.755]  So good for your teeth.
[02:02:00.795 --> 02:02:01.695]  Has no additives.
[02:02:01.775 --> 02:02:02.735]  It has no fillers.
[02:02:02.795 --> 02:02:06.416]  My dad, a dentist, oral surgeon, designed it because of the COVID lockdowns.
[02:02:07.611 --> 02:02:09.514]  Supply Chain Promise has been sold out for over six months.
[02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:13.381]  It's back in stock with the mouthwash at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:02:13.862 --> 02:02:15.345]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[02:02:15.865 --> 02:02:17.869]  And go back to your phone calls!
[02:02:18.891 --> 02:02:19.892]  Who is up next here?
[02:02:21.991 --> 02:02:23.732]  That would be George in Nevada.
[02:02:23.772 --> 02:02:25.192]  George, welcome.
[02:02:25.272 --> 02:02:29.854]  You say your niece was vaxxed many years ago without parents knowing.
[02:02:30.154 --> 02:02:39.118]  Yeah, we've seen hundreds of cases in Texas, Alabama, New York, areas of Europe, where decades ago they were injecting children without telling parents.
[02:02:39.398 --> 02:02:44.320]  They got caught doing it Australia-wide last month, and the health minister said, big deal, get over it.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:44.740]  Go ahead.
[02:02:45.581 --> 02:02:45.841]  Right.
[02:02:46.141 --> 02:02:48.382]  Well, here's the thing, Mr. Jones.
[02:02:49.474 --> 02:02:52.316]  My niece said that they separated the boys from the girls.
[02:02:52.396 --> 02:02:55.999]  She didn't see the boys, but it was all girls in the school.
[02:02:56.019 --> 02:03:00.062]  And when she went home, her arm was sore.
[02:03:00.562 --> 02:03:03.624]  And my brother, you know, what's wrong with your arm?
[02:03:03.684 --> 02:03:07.247]  And she told him that they had vaccinated her and not to tell him.
[02:03:08.307 --> 02:03:11.109]  So he immediately called the police, went to the school.
[02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:13.631]  He was told to wait outside.
[02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:15.773]  He goes, the police go into the school.
[02:03:16.633 --> 02:03:17.514]  They come back out.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.783]  That's exactly what they said in Australia.
[02:03:22.883 --> 02:03:25.965]  They said, get over it, big deal.
[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:49.892]  Yeah, he's called lawyers to no avail.
[02:03:49.912 --> 02:03:53.915]  None of them would return his call, so I guess... Well, listen, I misread the screen.
[02:03:53.955 --> 02:03:55.276]  I thought it happened 12 years ago.
[02:03:55.637 --> 02:03:57.678]  You're saying she's 12 years old, this just happened?
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:01.321]  In Dayton, Ohio.
[02:04:02.682 --> 02:04:04.524]  So this just happened in Dayton, Ohio?
[02:04:05.324 --> 02:04:10.789]  Yes, she lives in Kettering, but it's Dayton, Ohio, and they're not going to do anything about it.
[02:04:11.397 --> 02:04:12.858]  Yeah, well, that's attempted.
[02:04:12.938 --> 02:04:15.099]  I mean, that's a criminal Nuremberg violation.
[02:04:15.119 --> 02:04:16.020]  Wow.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.641]  I would love to get your name and number and try to get your brother on.
[02:04:19.022 --> 02:04:22.363]  So to walk through this, because I read the screen wrong and I apologize.
[02:04:24.245 --> 02:04:25.685]  What did they inject her with?
[02:04:25.906 --> 02:04:27.547]  They said, don't tell your parents.
[02:04:27.607 --> 02:04:29.768]  I mean, think about how criminal these people are.
[02:04:30.628 --> 02:04:31.189]  Right, right.
[02:04:31.329 --> 02:04:33.250]  And it was her and her best friend.
[02:04:33.690 --> 02:04:38.353]  And she said it was like 25, 30 girls, only girls, not boys, that she
[02:04:38.874 --> 02:04:42.396]  They may have done the boys in a different area, but this was only the girls.
[02:04:43.636 --> 02:04:44.557]  Don't tell your parents.
[02:04:44.637 --> 02:04:45.437]  They gave her the shot.
[02:04:46.218 --> 02:04:49.619]  And now she's having an issue with her eyesight, I guess, and her left eye.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:50.420]  Oh, I bet.
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:51.901]  Sir, I want to get your name and number.
[02:04:51.921 --> 02:04:53.541]  I want to come to Ohio.
[02:04:53.621 --> 02:04:55.062]  Can you get me in touch with your brother?
[02:04:55.862 --> 02:04:56.603]  Absolutely.
[02:04:56.963 --> 02:04:57.463]  Damn right.
[02:04:57.563 --> 02:04:59.324]  It's time to pick a place and make a stand.
[02:04:59.824 --> 02:05:01.245]  Those are damn criminals in there.
[02:05:01.645 --> 02:05:02.646]  That's equivalent of rape.
[02:05:02.666 --> 02:05:06.708]  I mean, they literally put genetic material into her without the consent of her parents or her.
[02:05:08.747 --> 02:05:08.947]  Yes.
[02:05:09.868 --> 02:05:20.976]  Yes, and the thing is, you know, like I said, he's very patient and, you know, he's waiting to see what's going to... If anybody's going to help him, if not, then, you know, he has to do what he's got to do, you know?
[02:05:22.517 --> 02:05:25.919]  Well, he needs to file a lawsuit against them and get them all in depositions.
[02:05:25.939 --> 02:05:30.182]  This is a criminal organization, a criminal group, but they've been caught all over the world doing it.
[02:05:30.262 --> 02:05:33.925]  California passed a law to inject 12 and up without parental consent.
[02:05:35.197 --> 02:05:35.637]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:05:35.677 --> 02:05:40.499]  North Carolina does not require political consent for COVID-19 vaccine, but some providers do.
[02:05:41.019 --> 02:05:41.299]  What?
[02:05:41.919 --> 02:05:52.143]  So you can't sell liquor or have sex with a kid, you can't sell them a real estate policy, you can't sell them an insurance policy, because they're not at the age of consent, but North Carolina?
[02:05:52.343 --> 02:05:53.163]  Put that back up!
[02:05:54.164 --> 02:05:55.024]  Probably not even true!
[02:05:57.145 --> 02:05:59.746]  But the state can shoot kids up without consent.
[02:05:59.966 --> 02:06:01.166]  That's bull, man!
[02:06:01.786 --> 02:06:03.747]  God, this is a revolution against everything we built.
[02:06:04.773 --> 02:06:06.053]  George, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:06:07.314 --> 02:06:08.174]  Give me your name and number.
[02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:09.474]  I want to talk to your brother, OK?
[02:06:11.935 --> 02:06:12.755]  Guys, follow that up.
[02:06:12.795 --> 02:06:13.435]  I'm sure it's true.
[02:06:13.455 --> 02:06:14.935]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:06:16.796 --> 02:06:18.416]  The state wants your children.
[02:06:20.416 --> 02:06:21.737]  The state is globalist run.
[02:06:23.737 --> 02:06:25.697]  That's George in Nevada, his brothers in Ohio.
[02:06:26.097 --> 02:06:27.938]  Carlos in Canada, frequent caller.
[02:06:28.598 --> 02:06:30.398]  Carlos, what is your take on the situation?
[02:06:31.219 --> 02:06:31.799]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:32.179 --> 02:06:33.219]  Well, what we have here
[02:06:33.872 --> 02:06:45.762]  It's a sophisticated, more evil, because Mr. Fauci has gone full Monty on everybody on this one.
[02:06:47.543 --> 02:06:51.487]  There's an article on Spiegel online, March 12th, 2010.
[02:06:53.567 --> 02:07:05.794]  And they did a review, and I am certain that Spiegel is now doing a review on this one, on this pandemic, this reconstruction of a mass hysteria, the swine flu pandemic of 2009.
[02:07:06.335 --> 02:07:18.622]  And what it basically says is that when the swine flu emerged in 2009, the World Health Organization officials estimated that between 2 and 7.4 million could die of the H1N1.
[02:07:22.116 --> 02:07:24.737]  The panic that ensued mounted worldwide.
[02:07:25.697 --> 02:07:27.997]  As it turns out, it was a dud.
[02:07:28.157 --> 02:07:32.398]  But there were companies like Tamiflu, produced Tamiflu.
[02:07:32.739 --> 02:07:39.020]  This company was Gilead Sciences, a familiar name in the current pandemic.
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:46.822]  And the German magazine, The Spiegel, did an analysis of this reconstruction of the hysteria and wrote that in May,
[02:07:47.498 --> 02:08:07.673]  Mid-May 2009, about three weeks before the swine flu was declared a pandemic, 30 senior representatives of pharmaceutical companies met with World Health Organization Director General Chen and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at WHO headquarters.
[02:08:08.193 --> 02:08:14.638]  The vaccine industry was mainly interested in one question, the decision to declare phase six
[02:08:15.376 --> 02:08:16.116]  What was Phase 6?
[02:08:16.656 --> 02:08:28.279]  Phase 6 acted as a switch that would allow bells on the industry's cash registers to ring, risk-free, because many pandemic vaccine contracts had already been signed.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:33.301]  Germany, for example, signed an agreement with British firm GlaxoSmithKline.
[02:08:33.561 --> 02:08:37.442]  Sure, once they declare the pandemic, which it wasn't, then everybody has to buy the product.
[02:08:38.072 --> 02:08:38.472]  Exactly.
[02:08:38.733 --> 02:08:40.434]  That was 2009.
[02:08:41.374 --> 02:08:48.700]  My province of Quebec bought $2 billion worth of Tamiflu from Gilead Sciences.
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:51.802]  Who was behind Gilead Sciences?
[02:08:52.663 --> 02:08:53.503]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:08:54.224 --> 02:08:59.128]  Who purchased Gilead Sciences thereafter?
[02:08:59.148 --> 02:09:00.408]  George Soros.
[02:09:01.049 --> 02:09:01.489]  In March 2020,
[02:09:04.517 --> 02:09:04.777]  I think?
[02:09:35.031 --> 02:09:36.632]  We're good to go.
[02:09:59.178 --> 02:10:15.792]  That's right, they've set up a scam and at the end of their Ponzi scheme, instead of going to jail like Bernie Madoff, we all become their slaves, we get locked in our houses and we become prisoners under COVID hysteria, and the average leftist does it because they like to sit at home and watch Netflix for free, even though soon they'll have no job and be starving to death.
[02:10:16.112 --> 02:10:17.153]  Beautifully said, Carlos.
[02:10:17.313 --> 02:10:19.155]  Alright, Trish in Michigan.
[02:10:20.237 --> 02:10:28.267]  Oliver, Josh, Joe, Cody, everybody, I'm gonna jam your calls in, then I'll hand the baton to Dr. Kaufman coming up, and I'm gonna get to your calls.
[02:10:28.347 --> 02:10:38.339]  Be ready and start your engines, but whatever you do, tell folks about the embattledinfowars.com, where freedom and the human spirit lives.
[02:10:38.959 --> 02:10:40.081]  We'll be right back.
[02:10:41.442 --> 02:10:47.008]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[02:10:47.509 --> 02:10:54.176]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[02:10:55.017 --> 02:10:56.578]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[02:10:57.339 --> 02:11:00.823]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[02:11:38.372 --> 02:11:39.712]  Thank you and God bless.
[02:11:41.252 --> 02:11:54.315]  Not only has the lockdown 2 started by stealth, but now they're rolling out the COVID passports right where I live in Austin, all over the city.
[02:11:55.393 --> 02:11:58.375]  Well, I had a teacher in May of this year take the first shot of the Moderna vaccine.
[02:11:58.795 --> 02:12:01.117]  And then, two weeks later, she got the second shot two days later.
[02:12:24.571 --> 02:12:26.432]  She was full of blood clots and dead.
[02:12:27.612 --> 02:12:30.393]  I had a cousin take the Moderna shot.
[02:12:32.094 --> 02:12:40.556]  She didn't take the second shot because the first shot made her heart, for five days, feel like it was coming out of her chest.
[02:12:41.017 --> 02:12:41.717]  She wised up.
[02:12:41.797 --> 02:12:42.397]  She didn't do it.
[02:12:42.737 --> 02:12:43.617]  She's still alive.
[02:12:44.898 --> 02:12:47.719]  I use the religious exemption for my children in school.
[02:12:48.379 --> 02:12:50.800]  In Pennsylvania here, it works every time.
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:53.061]  I tell them, no needles in my kid.
[02:12:53.561 --> 02:12:53.961]  That's it.
[02:12:54.895 --> 02:12:57.708]  The New World Order has gone for the kill shot on us.
[02:12:58.171 --> 02:12:58.633]  I know it.
[02:12:58.653 --> 02:12:59.597]  I feel it.
[02:13:00.612 --> 02:13:01.872]  We're going to beat them.
[02:13:02.213 --> 02:13:03.133]  Well, that's the thing, sir.
[02:13:03.193 --> 02:13:04.633]  I don't just have the VAERS reporting.
[02:13:04.653 --> 02:13:05.854]  I don't just have all the documents.
[02:13:06.734 --> 02:13:10.495]  I know a bunch of people who died or had heart attacks when they took it, including young people.
[02:13:10.875 --> 02:13:13.756]  And then I run into people on the street everywhere telling me the same thing.
[02:13:13.776 --> 02:13:15.817]  I mean, they are killing us.
[02:13:15.877 --> 02:13:17.217]  This is insane.
[02:13:17.678 --> 02:13:25.300]  And they're just normalizing it to test to see if they can give, quote, booster shots that Israel says are killing even more people.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.161]  Because every time we don't resist, they just up the attack.
[02:13:29.141 --> 02:13:30.722]  They're going for the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:13:31.663 --> 02:13:32.724]  Right now, people wake up.
[02:13:33.825 --> 02:13:34.886]  Oliver, let me ask you this.
[02:13:34.926 --> 02:13:37.468]  Did the local school teacher's family wake up when she died?
[02:13:38.588 --> 02:13:41.451]  My daughter talked to her stepdaughter on Facebook.
[02:13:42.171 --> 02:13:45.674]  And she says, yes, my stepmom died from the vaccine.
[02:13:45.934 --> 02:13:46.555]  She was healthy.
[02:13:46.575 --> 02:13:47.956]  She's 41 years old.
[02:13:48.436 --> 02:13:50.258]  She played softball still.
[02:13:50.938 --> 02:13:52.259]  Didn't smoke, didn't drink.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.401]  And all of a sudden, boom!
[02:13:54.661 --> 02:13:57.763]  After the second shot, two days later, rushed to the hospital.
[02:13:57.804 --> 02:13:58.304]  Couldn't walk.
[02:13:59.103 --> 02:14:02.724]  It's a shame.
[02:14:02.764 --> 02:14:03.804]  It's a shame, brother.
[02:14:03.844 --> 02:14:04.545]  They killed her.
[02:14:05.245 --> 02:14:07.325]  And they did it through people that thought they were heroes.
[02:14:07.405 --> 02:14:08.245]  It's all been scripted.
[02:14:08.285 --> 02:14:10.966]  It's all a behavioral psychologist war game.
[02:14:11.466 --> 02:14:14.007]  But there's good psychologists and people fighting back on the other side.
[02:14:14.027 --> 02:14:15.087]  One of them is a psychiatrist.
[02:14:15.407 --> 02:14:16.007]  He's coming up.
[02:14:16.047 --> 02:14:17.048]  Thank you so much, Oliver.
[02:14:17.068 --> 02:14:17.548]  God bless you.
[02:14:17.568 --> 02:14:18.448]  I hear the pain in your voice.
[02:14:19.108 --> 02:14:19.888]  I know how real it is.
[02:14:19.928 --> 02:14:21.209]  Believe me, I've had losses as well.
[02:14:22.048 --> 02:14:22.808]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:14:22.868 --> 02:14:24.849]  I just wanted to make two quick little points.
[02:14:24.869 --> 02:14:26.030]  You know, how do they go and make
[02:14:41.644 --> 02:14:46.105]  You know, a distinguishing, distinguish between the first variant and the Delta variant.
[02:14:46.125 --> 02:14:48.886]  You know, you can't even tell which one's which.
[02:14:48.906 --> 02:14:49.727]  This is ridiculous.
[02:14:50.207 --> 02:14:51.067]  People need to wake up.
[02:14:51.487 --> 02:14:54.608]  They admit they're just turning up computers to find whatever they want.
[02:14:54.688 --> 02:14:55.348]  It's total bull.
[02:14:55.588 --> 02:15:00.130]  It's like you can have dead silence in a room with soundproofing, no sound.
[02:15:00.970 --> 02:15:05.792]  You can turn a microphone up until it finally hears sound and does feedback.
[02:15:06.112 --> 02:15:09.553]  And that's, they set it for what they want and then they turn it up until it finds it.
[02:15:11.024 --> 02:15:11.825]  What do you mean?
[02:15:26.457 --> 02:15:27.298]  We're good to go.
[02:15:45.407 --> 02:15:47.668]  Brother, it's all in our face.
[02:15:47.768 --> 02:15:48.909]  I totally agree with you.
[02:15:49.409 --> 02:15:54.812]  They cooked up an artificial virus so they could create a vaccine for that that then kills you.
[02:15:55.532 --> 02:15:56.733]  So the virus is real.
[02:15:56.893 --> 02:15:58.414]  It's not a very dangerous virus.
[02:15:58.834 --> 02:16:06.258]  Almost everyone has died of something else, but now there is mass death from the vaccine, and they admit it, but they think the public's too ignorant to admit it.
[02:16:06.298 --> 02:16:09.760]  But you hear how many people know their family members have died from this.
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:12.321]  We're going to bring Fauci and others to justice.
[02:16:12.361 --> 02:16:12.721]  Don't worry.
[02:16:12.781 --> 02:16:14.022]  One way or another, they'll be brought to justice.
[02:16:14.462 --> 02:16:15.282]  That's how the universe works.
[02:16:15.322 --> 02:16:15.842]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:16:16.203 --> 02:16:17.403]  But these psychotics can't help it.
[02:16:17.423 --> 02:16:18.063]  They have to kill.
[02:16:18.944 --> 02:16:23.465]  So don't think they're invincible just because they have this much chutzpah or bravado or hubris and do this.
[02:16:24.165 --> 02:16:25.586]  Realize that's their nature.
[02:16:26.166 --> 02:16:27.747]  Their nature is to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:16:28.167 --> 02:16:30.728]  Cody and Trish and then Dr. Kaufman takes over.
[02:16:33.089 --> 02:16:35.690]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:16:37.350 --> 02:16:39.091]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:16:40.865 --> 02:16:46.051]  We are the pro-human network, bringing all people together for a human future.
[02:16:46.071 --> 02:16:53.800]  All right, I got two final calls I promise to jam in, then our special guest host is about to take over, Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[02:16:55.083 --> 02:16:59.408]  He's been having amazing interviews, amazing shows, so I'm just cutting into him right now.
[02:16:59.748 --> 02:17:04.233]  Even though his material and information is better than mine, he's fresh and ready to go.
[02:17:04.293 --> 02:17:06.936]  But I promised to go to Cody and Trish, so here we go.
[02:17:07.297 --> 02:17:11.141]  Cody in FEMA Region 7, vaccine side effects story.
[02:17:11.181 --> 02:17:11.722]  Tell us about it.
[02:17:12.635 --> 02:17:23.681]  Yeah Alex, it's amazing the way the universe works because you were talking about blood curdling with this doctor that's going to come on and that's exactly what happened to my grandmother.
[02:17:24.161 --> 02:17:40.149]  She was having heart palpitations, went to the ER, they went to draw blood to test and as it was filling the vial, it clotted instantly and they had to redraw a second time and it blows me away that people don't see that sort of stuff.
[02:17:42.837 --> 02:17:43.858]  It's scary.
[02:17:44.839 --> 02:17:53.649]  Well, you know the term blood curdling, for those that don't know, when milk becomes stagnant and basically curdles in little balls, it's called blood curdling or milk curdling.
[02:17:54.290 --> 02:17:57.954]  So the blood is literally curdling in the body after these injections.
[02:17:58.394 --> 02:18:02.279]  Wow, so the very term blood curdling, which means horror, fear, death.
[02:18:03.632 --> 02:18:10.093]  Yes, yes, it was quite stunning and then the last caller you had about his niece losing her eyesight.
[02:18:10.193 --> 02:18:22.476]  I know someone else that got the Johnson & Johnson and their eyesight, they're, you know, in their 60s and now they're going blind and they were perfectly fine before and people just don't want to accept the truth.
[02:18:22.536 --> 02:18:26.656]  I think it's so horrible they just have to deny it and so they allow it to happen.
[02:18:26.696 --> 02:18:28.777]  Well, that's the psychology and what's happening is
[02:18:29.537 --> 02:18:30.578]  This is modern war.
[02:18:30.658 --> 02:18:32.119]  It's biological war by the globalists.
[02:18:32.139 --> 02:18:33.500]  They've got to get rid of the population.
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:36.422]  Americans think they are owed all this debt.
[02:18:36.462 --> 02:18:38.003]  Americans want all these services.
[02:18:38.544 --> 02:18:44.668]  And so the decision is just made to stun the society, create cloud and piven, and collapse the society.
[02:18:44.688 --> 02:18:47.710]  I mean, that's what the Rockefeller Foundation said they would do.
[02:18:48.251 --> 02:18:49.692]  And so it's a new type of war.
[02:18:49.712 --> 02:18:52.334]  If it was tanks and airplanes, we would stand up and defeat it.
[02:18:52.374 --> 02:18:54.815]  But no, instead it comes in white lab coats.
[02:18:55.136 --> 02:18:56.457]  And most of the people doing it, Cody,
[02:18:57.988 --> 02:18:59.229]  Think they're good.
[02:18:59.249 --> 02:19:00.270]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:19:00.290 --> 02:19:00.991]  They don't even know.
[02:19:01.992 --> 02:19:02.532]  Exactly.
[02:19:02.632 --> 02:19:03.853]  And that's the scary part.
[02:19:03.933 --> 02:19:08.437]  You know, they say the pathway to hell is paved in good intention.
[02:19:08.817 --> 02:19:10.799]  And that's exactly what we're living right now.
[02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:12.901]  Amazing time, Cody.
[02:19:13.001 --> 02:19:14.302]  What else happened to your grandmother?
[02:19:15.024 --> 02:19:18.387]  Um, so as far as after that, nothing else, but it scared her.
[02:19:18.447 --> 02:19:21.930]  And there was mention of, you know, oh, you have to get a third round of booster.
[02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:23.931]  And she said, that's not happening.
[02:19:24.612 --> 02:19:28.475]  And so she's, she's lucky where she is now.
[02:19:28.535 --> 02:19:29.475]  She's in her eighties.
[02:19:29.575 --> 02:19:30.036]  So, you know,
[02:19:30.576 --> 02:19:40.665]  Only time will tell, but it certainly gave her quite a shock, so I'm just thankful she's still here, and continue to fight the good fight, you know?
[02:19:40.685 --> 02:19:43.627]  God bless you, God bless you, Cody.
[02:19:43.707 --> 02:19:44.448]  It's insane.
[02:19:44.568 --> 02:19:47.791]  The mainline medical literature says it causes massive blood clots.
[02:19:47.911 --> 02:19:49.472]  I mean, all these vaccines, they're not vaccines.
[02:19:49.953 --> 02:19:51.874]  Alright, last caller, then our special guest host takes over.
[02:19:52.194 --> 02:19:53.816]  Trish in Michigan, go ahead and thanks for holding.
[02:19:55.161 --> 02:19:56.482]  Hi, this is Tricia Michigan.
[02:19:57.203 --> 02:20:06.729]  I've been trying to be patient with calling and I'll try to make this quick, but send a shout out there to Brandon in Michigan for all the stickers.
[02:20:06.789 --> 02:20:09.211]  I've probably ran across them, never met them, don't know them.
[02:20:09.771 --> 02:20:15.675]  And Alice's awesome breakdown, which I identify with Jesus as my Lord and Savior, and I've not taken a shot.
[02:20:16.095 --> 02:20:18.697]  I have all the documentation you have that you present.
[02:20:18.837 --> 02:20:23.801]  I have it in case I need it, but I will lose my job over that because I know
[02:20:24.421 --> 02:20:26.483]  To save my life, I shall surely lose it.
[02:20:26.844 --> 02:20:31.589]  And I am so thankful to God, Alex, that you are fulfilling the calling on your life.
[02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:33.311]  Don't ever give up.
[02:20:33.451 --> 02:20:34.612]  We're all in this together.
[02:20:34.632 --> 02:20:37.636]  And I'm a woman in the marina with you.
[02:20:40.672 --> 02:20:43.653]  I just want to say, I use all the products.
[02:20:43.733 --> 02:20:44.734]  I love the iodine.
[02:20:45.374 --> 02:20:47.635]  And there's not too many shirts that I don't have.
[02:20:47.795 --> 02:20:48.915]  I'm a walking billboard.
[02:20:48.935 --> 02:20:50.876]  That's all I wear to work or wherever I'm at.
[02:20:50.916 --> 02:20:52.236]  I get compliments on them all.
[02:20:52.636 --> 02:20:55.778]  And I have two shirts from down there in January 6th, of course.
[02:20:56.658 --> 02:21:00.879]  You know, I just wait for somebody to ask me questions because I can't wait to switch the truth on them.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:06.802]  And it's just, in a sense, don't let fear hold you back because it's just fake evidence appearing real.
[02:21:08.415 --> 02:21:13.457]  My grandson that you signed that bullhorn for down in DC when I hopped the back of the fence.
[02:21:14.178 --> 02:21:18.099]  He knows that we go to church, we went to Trump parades, and he knows Alex Jones.
[02:21:18.899 --> 02:21:21.260]  And the wound care gel is awesome.
[02:21:22.081 --> 02:21:27.163]  If you want to know how well it works, my daughter-in-law was bringing them over here for me to babysit.
[02:21:28.141 --> 02:21:34.404]  And he touched a curling iron and burned his hand severely and I went right for the wound care gel, put it on his finger and it stopped.
[02:21:34.444 --> 02:21:35.984]  He stopped crying right then and there.
[02:21:36.304 --> 02:21:39.066]  So, what better person to support the wound care gel?
[02:21:39.086 --> 02:21:40.006]  Well, you're awesome, Trish.
[02:21:40.046 --> 02:21:42.567]  What was your call on Governor Whitmer and the mandates?
[02:21:43.708 --> 02:21:45.488]  Uh, well, I can tell you what.
[02:21:46.269 --> 02:21:47.669]  I don't support her one bit.
[02:21:48.189 --> 02:21:49.350]  My dad passed away.
[02:21:50.137 --> 02:21:50.537]  We're good to go.
[02:22:08.162 --> 02:22:11.365]  I'm not going to follow her because she's not God.
[02:22:11.425 --> 02:22:15.288]  And like I said, the Lord, may he get all the honor and glory and all we say and do.
[02:22:15.308 --> 02:22:21.813]  Because in Luke 10, I've been just waiting for a long time to get back and talk with you again.
[02:22:21.853 --> 02:22:27.818]  But Luke 10, chapter 10, verse 3, go your ways.
[02:22:28.259 --> 02:22:30.961]  Behold, I send you forth as lambs among the wolves.
[02:22:31.909 --> 02:22:33.550]  And that's what we are fighting.
[02:22:50.535 --> 02:22:53.357]  The injection and proof to come in them now.
[02:22:53.377 --> 02:22:58.640]  Restaurants, banks, stores, hotels, wedding venues.
[02:22:59.181 --> 02:23:02.303]  We're going to cover this first hour of the war room in about 50 minutes.
[02:23:02.743 --> 02:23:09.208]  I want to hand the baton over to Dr. Andrew Kaufman, who went to MIT and MD for the Medical University of South Carolina.
[02:23:09.588 --> 02:23:11.569]  And he's a psychiatrist, which is a medical doctor.
[02:23:11.869 --> 02:23:17.213]  And he's been a very well-spoken leading exposer of the tyranny we're witnessing.
[02:23:17.493 --> 02:23:18.914]  So I want to hand the baton to him right now.
[02:23:18.954 --> 02:23:20.135]  Dr. Kaufman, thank you so much.
[02:23:21.616 --> 02:23:25.319]  Alex, it's great to be here and thank you for having me.
[02:23:26.179 --> 02:23:40.450]  Once again, I want to say that I'm Dr. Andrew Kaufman coming to you live from Central New York on this sunny day of August 11th, 2021, and hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:23:40.651 --> 02:23:48.196]  And we have a very, let's see, information-filled hour as usual.
[02:23:48.276 --> 02:23:50.278]  And I'm going to have two stories today.
[02:23:50.974 --> 02:23:56.851]  Uh, the first story that I want to announce is called Freedom, Collectivism and Totalitarianism.
[02:23:57.401 --> 02:24:08.505]  And I was very reassured to hear some of the comments from the callers with Alex just a moment ago, because it seems that this audience is a little bit more awake to the situation than others.
[02:24:08.565 --> 02:24:22.291]  But I'm going to cover the historical, philosophical, and recent events that add up to this collectivist and totalitarian takeover and give you some concrete suggestions about what to do.
[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:32.602]  But the first story I'm going to discuss tonight is I'm going to tell you about the fraud that is called the Delta Variant.
[02:24:32.702 --> 02:24:38.164]  And I want to assure you that this is a completely made up and fabricated construct.
[02:24:38.224 --> 02:24:44.185]  And I'm going to lay out the exact scientific principles that demonstrate
[02:24:44.865 --> 02:25:01.216]  How misinterpreted and false this notion is and of course as we know this is what is being used to manipulate us and to justify new policies as we mentioned from Governor Whitmer and many other authority figures.
[02:25:01.736 --> 02:25:11.223]  So I've been very critical of virology and that they do these experiments which are really a tissue culture and they call viral isolation.
[02:25:11.723 --> 02:25:13.324]  Now this is their standard.
[02:25:14.353 --> 02:25:19.455]  As flawed as it is for how to prove the existence of a virus.
[02:25:19.855 --> 02:25:27.098]  Well let me tell you that they have never even attempted this experiment for any variant including the Delta variant.
[02:25:27.719 --> 02:25:35.562]  Now if this is their experiment that they use to actually prove that a specific virus exists and they haven't even attempted it,
[02:25:36.107 --> 02:25:38.512]  Well, how can they say that this exists?
[02:25:38.813 --> 02:25:42.100]  Of course, this is a major flaw in reasoning.
[02:25:42.621 --> 02:25:45.026]  Now they have only called this
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:54.426]  A thing with many other thousands of variants based on this computer simulated in silico genome sequencing.
[02:25:54.827 --> 02:25:58.369]  And I'm going to review that in just a moment when we come back after the break.
[02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:14.162]  But I want to also tell the viewers out there that if you want to learn about the real biology and the real ways of healing like some of the products sold on this show, the True Healing Conference will be October 9th through 10th in Jacksonville, Florida.
[02:26:14.442 --> 02:26:15.423]  True Healing Conference.
[02:26:16.874 --> 02:26:26.022]  Once again, I'm your guest host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, here live from Central New York on this day of August 11th, 2021.
[02:26:26.703 --> 02:26:37.993]  Before the break, I started talking about the lie that they call the Delta Variant, and I also announced the True Healing Conference there, so please do check that out to come see us in person.
[02:26:38.714 --> 02:26:40.496]  But back to the Delta Variant.
[02:26:41.476 --> 02:27:01.586]  So, I had mentioned that there have been no attempts to isolate not only the Delta variant, but any other variant, and that this has been discovered by an inability to validate and repeat an experiment and get the same results, which I'm referring to this in silico or computer simulated genome sequencing.
[02:27:02.027 --> 02:27:09.070]  That's really the only pseudo evidence they have at all to say that there is such a thing as any variant.
[02:27:11.138 --> 02:27:17.102]  They report a lot of properties about this in terms of how it behaves clinically, like is it transmissible?
[02:27:17.702 --> 02:27:19.443]  Is it cause severe illness?
[02:27:20.004 --> 02:27:38.355]  Well, it turns out that they didn't actually study the virus itself, but they looked at some experiments that I will describe with monoclonal antibodies, pseudoviruses, which are essentially lab-created simulated viruses, and of course more computer modeling.
[02:27:39.131 --> 02:27:43.875]  And I also want you to know that there is no test for any variant.
[02:27:43.935 --> 02:27:52.683]  So we have these variety of diagnostic tests like the PCR test, the antigen test, antibody test, the lateral flow test, etc.
[02:27:53.675 --> 02:28:06.538]  And of course, all of these are experimental diagnostic tests and none have actually been validated, but they are all only for the original version of the made-up SARS-CoV-2.
[02:28:07.079 --> 02:28:17.862]  And none of these tests have been studied or gotten any type of emergency use authorization or any other permission from the government to sell them.
[02:28:17.902 --> 02:28:19.262]  In fact, I don't even think
[02:28:19.882 --> 02:28:27.331]  They've been developed so there is no way for any person to go and get a test for any variant.
[02:28:27.411 --> 02:28:32.417]  So how do they actually know that this thing is real or that people have it?
[02:28:33.118 --> 02:28:38.725]  So if we could go to the next slide, I want to discuss an outbreak that was reported.
[02:28:39.452 --> 02:28:52.325]  In Cape Cod, Massachusetts, a vacation destination, and I did mention this briefly last week, but it is important to go over this because what we can see here is a lot of contradictions.
[02:28:52.806 --> 02:29:02.095]  So what happened here is that we had in this vacation area this summer an alleged outbreak of a couple hundred people with
[02:29:03.021 --> 02:29:03.962]  COVID-19.
[02:29:04.002 --> 02:29:10.188]  Now, of course, we are using an invalid test to denote that these people have COVID.
[02:29:10.208 --> 02:29:13.631]  So really, this whole study could be tossed aside.
[02:29:13.912 --> 02:29:17.415]  But let's just take it at face value and look at what they found.
[02:29:17.916 --> 02:29:24.362]  Well, they reported that in Massachusetts overall, the population about 69% have been vaccinated.
[02:29:27.034 --> 02:29:38.622]  Okay, now in this outbreak of all the people who were diagnosed as having COVID in this outbreak, they said 74% of them were fully vaccinated.
[02:29:39.082 --> 02:29:44.967]  Now that is a higher percentage than the number of people who've been vaccinated overall.
[02:29:45.367 --> 02:29:55.414]  So what this suggests is that you actually have an increased risk of getting sick with this particular illness, whatever it is,
[02:29:56.428 --> 02:30:04.315]  If you are vaccinated, because the percentage of vaccinated people in this outbreak were higher than in the general population.
[02:30:04.355 --> 02:30:08.940]  So vaccinated people were overrepresented in this outbreak sample.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:22.332]  Now, despite that later down the paragraph, after it reports these critical statistics, there is a recommendation to that the vaccine is the most important strategy.
[02:30:22.833 --> 02:30:25.514]  To use to protect against this illness.
[02:30:25.935 --> 02:30:31.438]  Now, how is that the best strategy when it actually increases your risk of getting sick?
[02:30:31.878 --> 02:30:38.721]  So this is what happens when you read some of these official documents is that you see these obvious inherent contradictions.
[02:30:38.781 --> 02:30:44.224]  And this is a great sign that what you're reading is propaganda rather than science.
[02:30:44.304 --> 02:30:51.288]  Now, even if we talk about the severity of the illness, out of the few people that were hospitalized as a result of this outbreak,
[02:30:51.852 --> 02:30:55.514]  Four out of five of them, 80% were vaccinated.
[02:30:55.874 --> 02:31:00.597]  So it's not that they are more likely to get sick but have less severe illness.
[02:31:00.677 --> 02:31:05.099]  It's actually they're more likely to get sick and they have more severe illness.
[02:31:05.719 --> 02:31:08.281]  And that's essentially what this is telling you.
[02:31:08.806 --> 02:31:15.907]  Now, it also reports here that 89% of these cases were with the Delta variant, but that doesn't exist.
[02:31:16.007 --> 02:31:18.088]  So that number is really meaningless.
[02:31:18.128 --> 02:31:23.269]  But they put such a high percentage in there because they want to scare us, intimidate us.
[02:31:23.789 --> 02:31:31.751]  And that is the way that they're going to justify further lockdowns, mask mandates and whatever else they might come up with next.
[02:31:31.831 --> 02:31:34.771]  And we have some ideas about what's in the pipeline.
[02:31:35.131 --> 02:31:38.412]  Now, once again, it mentions in this report that
[02:31:38.917 --> 02:31:42.765]  Antibody studies were used to make some of these determinations.
[02:31:42.805 --> 02:31:46.553]  So let's look a little bit closer of this if we could check out the next slide please.
[02:31:47.401 --> 02:31:55.668]  Now, I just want to make one more point because that is not the only study showing that people who are vaccinated are not protected.
[02:31:55.768 --> 02:32:02.373]  We have this other publication here talking about breakthrough infections with the Delta variant.
[02:32:02.774 --> 02:32:06.397]  So I believe that we're going to see more and more reporting about this.
[02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:14.183]  But the CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, as you'll see in the next slide, is not quite confident
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:27.750]  Enough to make a bold statement, but she is acknowledging that quote, the Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others.
[02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:38.159]  So she doesn't say that the Delta variant will make people who are vaccinated sick, but she says that it will cause vaccinated people to be able to spread
[02:32:38.948 --> 02:32:42.173]  This alleged variant virus to others.
[02:32:42.693 --> 02:32:51.947]  Now I have to beg the question, what exactly does a vaccine accomplish if it does not prevent transmission of the illness?
[02:32:53.246 --> 02:33:02.373]  Now if we go to the next slide, this is the page on the CDC website where they actually talk about what a variant is.
[02:33:02.753 --> 02:33:17.345]  So they define it and they give a classification system and the classification system is actually based on the potential health threat rather than, you know, the Greek letters as we have come to know.
[02:33:19.238 --> 02:33:27.582]  Interestingly, they don't even follow their own definitions about what classification to put for a particular variant.
[02:33:28.002 --> 02:33:42.229]  However, in this article, it doesn't actually discuss how they determined that there is a variant in the first place, and it also doesn't directly discuss how they determine the clinical characteristics.
[02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.207]  of such a variant.
[02:33:44.387 --> 02:33:48.668]  So you have to look to the reference sections and dig a little bit deeper.
[02:33:49.068 --> 02:33:58.650]  Now, it does say in a footnote that the variants are determined by the in silico genome sequence.
[02:33:59.090 --> 02:34:01.451]  So we know that at least has been confirmed.
[02:34:01.911 --> 02:34:12.453]  But you know, after the break, I'm going to talk about the crazy method that they use to ascertain any clinical information
[02:34:13.575 --> 02:34:19.756]  about these variants because, as you know, these variants don't actually exist.
[02:34:19.856 --> 02:34:25.717]  So they can't actually take the variant out of a sample, purify it, and study it.
[02:34:26.197 --> 02:34:28.358]  So what exactly do they do?
[02:34:28.578 --> 02:34:40.340]  I'll tell you that it will completely astonish you the lengths that they go to make up pseudoscientific information in order to create the fear that will
[02:34:41.232 --> 02:34:43.414]  Get us to go along with whatever they say.
[02:34:43.834 --> 02:34:46.156]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:46.816 --> 02:34:50.899]  I'm your host, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, coming to you live from Central New York.
[02:34:51.619 --> 02:35:07.050]  Before the break, we were speaking about the lie that is the Delta variant and I was going over the CDC's explanation for how they learn information about the clinical presentation and the behavior of these variants.
[02:35:07.711 --> 02:35:09.192]  And if we could have the next slide.
[02:35:10.086 --> 02:35:28.016]  I want to highlight that since they cannot actually get these viruses from nature because they don't actually exist, they go to the great length of synthesizing what they call a pseudovirus.
[02:35:28.396 --> 02:35:39.743]  Now this is a laboratory creation that they essentially make a fake version of the virus in order to conduct research because they can't get the real virus.
[02:35:40.430 --> 02:35:43.015]  And so you can see in this article that.
[02:35:43.695 --> 02:35:48.817]  is on the slide, this describes the procedure that was referenced by the CDC.
[02:35:49.257 --> 02:36:07.144]  So we created VSV, that is another fake virus, based SARS-78 CoV-2 pseudoviruses that contain each of the individual mutations as well as one with all eight mutations of the B.1.1.7 variant or the UK Delta 8
[02:36:11.335 --> 02:36:12.115]  And etc.
[02:36:12.135 --> 02:36:12.535]  etc.
[02:36:12.595 --> 02:36:19.838]  Now that B.1.1.7 is the code name for the Delta variant, just to confuse you.
[02:36:20.558 --> 02:36:30.141]  But what I would like to explain that they are actually doing here is they took the results of the computer simulated genome sequencing.
[02:36:30.948 --> 02:36:37.070]  Which they say is enough to tell that there is something different about this sequence.
[02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:56.276]  And they took those mutated sequences, or that they didn't get the same result as the original SARS virus, which was also a computer simulation, and they used an actual machine to synthesize those sequences of genetic material in the laboratory.
[02:36:57.185 --> 02:37:10.192]  And then they put those in this other virus particle that was a particle from a cell culture that they purified out and they emptied and then they're putting this material inside of it.
[02:37:10.812 --> 02:37:21.057]  And then what they do is they take these synthetic pseudovirus particles that they have concocted in the laboratory and they add them to a cell culture.
[02:37:21.938 --> 02:37:24.339]  Now they say that what will happen is that this
[02:37:25.812 --> 02:37:47.798]  Synthetic pseudovirus will invade the cells in that culture and then what they do is they mix different monoclonal antibodies that they say are for the SARS coronavirus with the cell culture and depending on how they react that's how they guesstimate
[02:37:48.317 --> 02:37:48.517]  What's
[02:38:02.970 --> 02:38:13.455]  A lot of false assumptions, but let's take it at face value once again that they have an antibody, for example, that's called a neutralizing antibody.
[02:38:13.836 --> 02:38:18.258]  And they say that this is the antibody that actually protects you from the infection.
[02:38:18.878 --> 02:38:26.082]  So when they add the neutralizing antibody to this pseudo virus cell culture, big mess,
[02:38:26.778 --> 02:38:29.779]  They can say, well, how tight does it bind?
[02:38:29.879 --> 02:38:33.040]  Does it react with this neutralizing antibody?
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:39.421]  And if it doesn't react very well, then they say it causes a more severe illness.
[02:38:40.282 --> 02:38:45.443]  Or they might say, based on the same kind of experiment, that it is more or less transmissible.
[02:38:45.923 --> 02:38:52.105]  But not once did they ever do a clinical study with people who were infected with this,
[02:38:52.944 --> 02:39:07.933]  Because they would have to first prove that it exists, then find out a way to reliably identify it, and then look at, you know, people with this variant versus another variant that they do the same way, and ascertain the information over time.
[02:39:08.353 --> 02:39:10.415]  But this is not really done.
[02:39:10.575 --> 02:39:20.861]  For example, when we're talking about the issue of asymptomatic transmission, the notion that people without symptoms can transmit disease to other people,
[02:39:21.872 --> 02:39:26.335]  There are real world studies and they all show that there was no transmission.
[02:39:26.916 --> 02:39:32.120]  But that wasn't good enough to justify the policies of social distancing and lockdowns.
[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:36.543]  So what did they do is they created a computer simulation study.
[02:39:37.163 --> 02:39:46.827]  And they tweaked the parameters on that simulation in order to make sure it showed that social isolation was effective at reducing transmission.
[02:39:47.347 --> 02:39:53.810]  The problem was that these illnesses don't exist inside of a computer or on a silicon wafer.
[02:39:54.390 --> 02:39:56.090]  They exist in the real world.
[02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:57.371]  People in the real world
[02:39:58.351 --> 02:40:00.453]  experience illness and sickness.
[02:40:00.833 --> 02:40:16.108]  And if we ever want to truly understand what is making people ill, we need to put aside all of this false and fraudulent research and actually study what is really in nature.
[02:40:18.464 --> 02:40:27.208]  All right, well, I'm going to shift gears now and get into my second story, but I hope that was helpful and illuminating about the Delta variant.
[02:40:27.869 --> 02:40:33.532]  And if we could please go two slides to the quote with freedom.
[02:40:34.532 --> 02:40:44.277]  And I want to start off with just a little bit of a monologue here, because many of you out there and many others who may not be listening.
[02:40:45.638 --> 02:40:48.439]  They've been having these kinds of thoughts, okay?
[02:40:48.659 --> 02:40:52.540]  The thoughts of, this will all end soon if we just stick it out.
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:56.801]  Or, I'll just take the weekly PCR test.
[02:40:57.061 --> 02:40:58.562]  It's better than the vax.
[02:40:59.622 --> 02:41:01.423]  Or, I'll get a religious exemption.
[02:41:02.043 --> 02:41:03.403]  I'll get a medical exemption.
[02:41:04.363 --> 02:41:06.344]  I will get a fake vaccine card.
[02:41:07.444 --> 02:41:10.145]  I'll take the least harmful of the vaccines.
[02:41:11.285 --> 02:41:12.986]  I'll wear a mask if I have to.
[02:41:14.668 --> 02:41:17.290]  I have to travel so I'll do what's required.
[02:41:18.451 --> 02:41:19.351]  I need my job.
[02:41:20.532 --> 02:41:24.035]  My kids need to be in public school so I can work.
[02:41:25.316 --> 02:41:33.581]  Well, if you've experienced these thoughts or impulses, you are no longer living in freedom.
[02:41:34.562 --> 02:41:36.864]  Now, you may not realize this yet.
[02:41:37.264 --> 02:41:39.726]  You may falsely believe that you are still free.
[02:41:40.518 --> 02:41:46.482]  But the truth is that you're not, and I'm going to lay out the evidence for that during this story today.
[02:41:47.062 --> 02:42:04.693]  And in fact, if you act on these thoughts and impulses, not only are you not free, but you are actually helping the elites plan to establish a totalitarian state where no one has any semblance of freedom at all.
[02:42:05.654 --> 02:42:07.815]  Do you think that it's not already happening?
[02:42:08.672 --> 02:42:10.715]  Well, I would request that you think again.
[02:42:10.735 --> 02:42:26.856]  And if you're waiting for the time to stand firm, the time to say no once and for all, thinking that there will be a breaking point, there will be a threshold, well, I'd like to tell you that the time is right now.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:30.981]  In fact, as I see it, this is really your last chance.
[02:42:31.581 --> 02:42:36.203]  Because if you stand up now, there may be some consequences.
[02:42:36.263 --> 02:42:38.143]  You may have to walk away from a job.
[02:42:38.543 --> 02:42:40.944]  You may have to take your child out of school.
[02:42:41.704 --> 02:42:46.446]  You may have to end even your marriage or other significant relationships.
[02:42:46.926 --> 02:42:50.167]  You may alienate yourself from your family.
[02:42:51.107 --> 02:42:53.808]  You may decrease your financial position.
[02:42:54.733 --> 02:43:13.332]  But I want to tell you that these are all very mild and minor things to risk, given the circumstance, because if you wait, if you delay, in the future, once the state is established, and we see this happening on a day-to-day basis right now,
[02:43:14.466 --> 02:43:17.287]  Then you will risk something much, much greater.
[02:43:17.367 --> 02:43:30.212]  We've seen this over and over again in history, that people who become disobedient once the totalitarian state is established will be killed.
[02:43:31.052 --> 02:43:32.373]  They will be imprisoned.
[02:43:32.453 --> 02:43:39.635]  They will be in forced labor camps, suffering torture and other forms of human rights abuse.
[02:43:40.676 --> 02:43:41.136]  Right now,
[02:43:41.952 --> 02:43:47.936]  Those consequences have not come into existence, especially not in the United States, but we really have to act.
[02:43:48.676 --> 02:44:00.743]  Now is the time to start saying no, start standing up, because freedom is the only thing, the only way that it is worth it to live.
[02:44:01.124 --> 02:44:07.588]  Look at all the suffering that we have observed from people living under the communism of the Soviet Union.
[02:44:07.928 --> 02:44:11.410]  All throughout my childhood, our pop culture was filled
[02:44:11.874 --> 02:44:19.577]  with stories about their plight and their suffering that we thought in the United States we would never experience.
[02:44:20.297 --> 02:44:23.098]  Hello and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:23.378 --> 02:44:29.020]  I'm your guest host Dr. Andrew Kaufman on this fourth hour today on August 11th.
[02:44:29.601 --> 02:44:41.045]  Before the break I was talking a bit about freedom and totalitarian and the timing and the situation that we are in right now and if we could put up the slide on freedom.
[02:44:41.685 --> 02:44:50.551]  I want to talk a little bit about what freedom is and what people have said about freedom because it is really one of the most important aspects to life.
[02:44:51.071 --> 02:45:02.399]  Freedom is the air we cannot do without, that we breathe without even noticing it until the time comes when, deprived of it, we feel that we are dying.
[02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:05.841]  And I have felt like this under the current regime.
[02:45:06.642 --> 02:45:07.963]  We could have the next slide, please.
[02:45:08.973 --> 02:45:22.543]  The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it.
[02:45:23.504 --> 02:45:36.214]  Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily or mental or spiritual, and that is a principle that it is imperative that we embody in the current climate.
[02:45:38.476 --> 02:45:45.121]  Now, there is a destructive political force that is threatening this freedom.
[02:45:45.962 --> 02:45:57.431]  And we have all talked about it using different names, but I want to get at the actual philosophy that is behind this political march toward totalitarianism.
[02:45:57.912 --> 02:46:01.154]  And this is called collectivism, if we could have the next slide.
[02:46:01.935 --> 02:46:07.880]  And collectivism is a type of societal structure
[02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:17.309]  Which the individual is subordinate to the whole or the collective, the society, the nation, etc.
[02:46:17.929 --> 02:46:29.081]  And collectivism is in contrast to individualism, where the individual, the man or the woman is the most important and that their rights and interests
[02:46:29.682 --> 02:46:42.935]  Are emphasized and that is the philosophy in fact that the United States of America is founded upon and the one that was ingrained in me as being of the most importance ever since I was a child.
[02:46:43.996 --> 02:46:45.117]  We can have the next slide.
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:51.503]  So this is from Ludwig von Mises.
[02:46:52.532 --> 02:47:04.625]  The individual has to subordinate himself to and conduct himself for the benefit of society and to sacrifice his selfish private interests to the common good.
[02:47:05.146 --> 02:47:13.455]  Now this is the attitude of the collectivist and we have seen this play out in the current pandemic situation and in fact
[02:47:13.855 --> 02:47:20.542]  We have learned that this was actually a purposeful narrative that was devised by psychologists on the people.
[02:47:21.162 --> 02:47:27.969]  So what I'm talking about is that when I was, you know, I've never actually worn a mask, not for once.
[02:47:28.329 --> 02:47:33.034]  And of course, I also lost my last job as a psychiatrist.
[02:47:33.633 --> 02:47:33.994]  I don't
[02:47:52.057 --> 02:48:09.925]  First of all, that there's any basis that you're not wearing a mask could have an effect on another person, but they're essentially saying that it's your responsibility to protect the safety of other people and that your own safety is a second fiddle to that goal.
[02:48:10.911 --> 02:48:23.676]  Now, we don't have to look far in history, if you could bring up the next slide, to see that collectivism was the philosophical underpinning of all communist, fascist, and social dictatorships.
[02:48:24.176 --> 02:48:30.679]  And we have this quote from none other than Hitler, the common good before the individual good.
[02:48:31.405 --> 02:48:45.589]  The first of many parallels that we'll see between the Nazi regime, the communist regimes of the Soviet Union, the People's Revolution in China, and the list goes on and on.
[02:48:45.649 --> 02:48:58.073]  Because if we come up with a list of collectivist supporters, we're going to find not only Hitler, but also Lenin and Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao Zedong, and others.
[02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:10.307]  So, in a collectivist system, the good of the society or the collective or the nation is put before that of the individual.
[02:49:10.988 --> 02:49:16.832]  However, what is in the good interest of the society?
[02:49:16.892 --> 02:49:18.093]  How does one determine that?
[02:49:18.153 --> 02:49:21.035]  Because the society is not a concrete thing.
[02:49:21.516 --> 02:49:24.078]  In other words, it's an abstract concept
[02:49:24.724 --> 02:49:30.428]  That makes up the totality of all the individuals in a community who live side by side with one another.
[02:49:30.888 --> 02:49:43.276]  And all those individuals have needs and things that would be good for their welfare, but there is no objective way to say what is good for the whole community, society, or nation at large.
[02:49:44.338 --> 02:49:55.372]  And this is very convenient for those collectivist leaders because what it means is that they are the ones who get to decide what is in the best interest.
[02:49:55.432 --> 02:50:03.142]  In other words, they make the decisions for the collective and you as an individual are supposed to follow their instructions or else
[02:50:03.598 --> 02:50:07.421]  Face the consequence, even giving your life to the state.
[02:50:08.022 --> 02:50:26.659]  So if we look at the next slide to see what's happening now is we see the collectivist leader who is the new director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, by the way, who is an academic physician scientist and then suddenly was made the head of the CDC and now has all of this
[02:50:27.699 --> 02:50:49.796]  political power and she is abusing this power severely because the CDC director, which is an appointed position, not part of the legislature, not a judge, and she directed the moratorium on evictions to be extended without having any authority based in law to do so.
[02:50:50.236 --> 02:50:56.521]  So this is an example of a technocrat, a scientific designated expert for the state,
[02:50:57.159 --> 02:50:58.200]  Making policy.
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:08.789]  Now, in our nation, we have legislative powers given specifically to the Congress and the House of Representatives, and they are the only ones who can make law.
[02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:21.140]  But what we have seen over and over again during this march toward the totalitarian state is that laws have been made by governors and
[02:51:21.801 --> 02:51:28.605]  Officials or the CDC and the National Institutes of Health without any legislative process or approval.
[02:51:29.106 --> 02:51:35.570]  And even in many cases, law enforcement officers are enforcing these, which are not laws.
[02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:48.338]  What this is is called the color of law, and it is extremely illegal and an excellent basis to sue people who are trying to impose this tyranny on you.
[02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:49.479]  Now the next slide.
[02:51:50.836 --> 02:52:05.025]  Here is anti-vaccine extremism is akin to domestic terrorism so that you can see censorship and scapegoating are a big part of the current agenda and we've seen those in every totalitarian regime.
[02:52:05.885 --> 02:52:14.010]  To poison public opinion against vaccinations could result in countless American deaths that is akin to domestic terrorism.
[02:52:14.551 --> 02:52:19.954]  So does this mean that we will have soldiers knocking at our doors to arrest us and
[02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:23.012]  Incarcerate us or even to take us out.
[02:52:23.512 --> 02:52:36.581]  If we talk about the objective science, which shows that vaccines in general, and especially the pseudo genetic COVID vaccines are extremely dangerous.
[02:52:38.422 --> 02:52:40.804]  Now, if we go skipped two slides here.
[02:52:41.371 --> 02:52:44.792]  And I want to show another aspect, which is reporting on your neighbor.
[02:52:45.272 --> 02:52:47.093]  We see coronavirus in Minnesota.
[02:52:47.153 --> 02:52:51.294]  Where to call if you see people who aren't social distancing?
[02:52:51.974 --> 02:52:56.695]  Once again, we find the same policies being supported in the Nazi Germany.
[02:52:56.775 --> 02:53:00.116]  If we could have the next slide after that, please.
[02:53:00.919 --> 02:53:20.735]  And now this is a very very concerning about what is going on in France right now because they are enacting a major surveillance state with requiring to have a digital passport showing your vaccine and health status and eventually even to buy groceries.
[02:53:21.336 --> 02:53:29.823]  So we can see the development of all of the aspects of collectivism and totalitarianism have already entered
[02:53:30.766 --> 02:53:45.727]  Our nation and other nations across the world seemingly in lockstep, according to an agenda carried out by a higher elite group who is really running this whole show.
[02:53:47.091 --> 02:53:52.913]  And if we could just have the next slide here, because I want to give you some words of hope and encouragement.
[02:53:53.414 --> 02:54:05.859]  The great citizens of a country are not those who bend the knee before authority, but rather those who against authority, if need be, are adamant as to the honor and freedom of that country.
[02:54:06.519 --> 02:54:09.200]  And one more quote from Henry David Thoreau.
[02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:12.882]  Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty.
[02:54:13.423 --> 02:54:15.505]  The obedient must be slaves.
[02:54:16.185 --> 02:54:22.651]  So this is your opportunity to exhibit that disobedience that embodies the human spirit.
[02:54:24.593 --> 02:54:35.823]  With that, I would like to remind everyone to please sign up for your free registration at the True Healing Conference because we will be embodying that spirit of freedom and disobedience
[02:54:40.011 --> 02:54:46.117]  But if people go to MyPillow.com, you have amazing sheets, towels, not just pillows.
