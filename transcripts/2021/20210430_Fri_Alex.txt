[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.772]  They've stolen the planet through fraud.
[00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:09.704]  And they believe that you're like weevils that have gotten into the grain supply in the pantry, and that you need to be exterminated.
[00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:15.372]  And when you act like a weevil, and don't stand up for yourself, and don't get informed, and don't organize,
[00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:21.090]  And don't demand innovation to empower humanity instead of enslaving humanity.
[00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:31.418]  And when you buy into the decadence and Satanism and unconsciousness that they're trying to sell you, you become what they claim you are in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:36.602]  And they will be able to then destroy you and your psyche and your soul and your mind.
[00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:39.905]  And bind you to them forever.
[00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.908]  People ask, why are you so upset, Jones?
[00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:43.709]  Why do you have so much energy?
[00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.029]  Well, because I realize I'm being assaulted.
[00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.750]  I realize I'm being overtaken.
[00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.391]  I realize I'm being dominated and slayed by very bad people, and I don't take it kindly.
[00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:57.092]  And I have an instinct to resist it and to organize against it, and that's what we've done here.
[00:00:57.353 --> 00:01:02.234]  And if other people would take this seriously, we would be able to turn this around very quickly.
[00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:06.115]  But if we don't turn it around, it's going to get much worse very, very fast.
[00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.456]  And don't worry, you'll wake up and fight finally at one point,
[00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:10.857]  And we're going to win in the end.
[00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:13.438]  The question is, how bad does it have to get first?
[00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:18.801]  Because the globalists, just because they have a will to dominate and control, doesn't mean they've even thought it all through.
[00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:20.322]  Doesn't mean they're going to succeed.
[00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:27.726]  They have an instinct to enslave and rape and kill and dominate because it's who they are, inbred genetic psychopaths.
[00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:32.929]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:49.174]  According to a recent Israeli study, Pfizer's vaccine is 40 times more deadly for old people than the actual COVID-19 virus.
[00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:56.761]  And deaths began skyrocketing in Vietnam and Cambodia once the vaccine was administered to the public.
[00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:09.813]  By all accounts, the cure and experimental mRNA gene therapy is far deadlier than the so-called asymptomatic disease, which amounts to the common cold.
[00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:12.627]  Despite the fact that the U.S.
[00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:19.369]  federal government deliberately poisoned the alcohol supply during Prohibition, killing at least 10,000 people.
[00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.672]  Infected thousands of children with the polio vaccine in 1955, leaving hundreds with paralysis and killing almost a dozen.
[00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:34.894]  Infected millions of Americans with simian virus from contaminated polio vaccines.
[00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:43.662]  And aggressively pushed highly addictive opioids on Americans while diligently securing the Afghan poppy fields with our U.S.
[00:02:43.702 --> 00:02:44.042]  troops.
[00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:55.854]  Despite a dreadful history of death, injury, and lies, millions of people are somehow willing to line up for the latest experimental shot from Big Pharma.
[00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:06.009]  But not only is the vaccine causing death and injury to the vaccinated, the vaccinated seem to be shedding something terrible to the unvaccinated.
[00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.676]  And Big Brother does not want you to know about it.
[00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:18.785]  If you Google search mRNA vaccine shedding, all you will find are articles claiming that such a thing is a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:21.028]  As if we are all stupid.
[00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.954]  But if you specify for anything published prior to, say, 2017, you will find a different story.
[00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:42.060]  Right at the top, studies show that vaccinated individuals spread disease, sources several scientific studies showing how vaccinated individuals can shed the virus for months and infect the unvaccinated.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.622]  And in their very own vaccine trials, Pfizer was concerned about shedding.
[00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:56.905]  In particular, they were concerned about pregnant women being exposed to vaccinated test subjects by inhalation or skin contact.
[00:03:58.045 --> 00:04:12.235]  After a young woman posted on Instagram how her menstrual cycles were affected after coming into contact with a person who had recently been vaccinated, she was inundated with hundreds of messages from other women who have experienced the same.
[00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:18.020]  Her account has been deleted several times by Instagram for sharing these stories.
[00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:23.576]  Women who have bled for weeks after being in contact with the vaccinated.
[00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:26.277]  Women bleeding from their eyes.
[00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:30.720]  Women who have bled so badly they needed blood transfusions.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.881]  Several women having miscarriages.
[00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:38.984]  And girls as young as one year old bleeding from their vaginas.
[00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:45.007]  These personal accounts are banned and censored from the public.
[00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:53.065]  And now President Joe Biden is announcing that fully vaccinated people can go outdoors without a mask.
[00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:57.046]  It seems that the worst is yet to come.
[00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:00.427]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.170]  Now that's yesterday's incredible report that's at Banned.Video.
[00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.831]  There's a new one by Greg Reese.
[00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:14.653]  We're going to premiere on the other side when we kick off the main transmission today.
[00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:17.197]  Friday, April 30th, the year is 2021.
[00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:26.713]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this is going to absolutely blow you away on the other side.
[00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:41.579]  A top Washington Post investigative journalist has come out and pointed out what Dr. Francis Boyle and others said on the show a year ago, but with the evidence that Fauci's covering up the Wuhan lab leak because he was running the secret illegal operations there, which is documented.
[00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.260]  But the fact is the Washington Post has come out with this.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.861]  That means big changes are afoot.
[00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:52.003]  So much more to cover today on this Friday Transmission!
[00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:19.688]  The globalists see themselves as guardians of the earth, guardians of the galaxy, and that they are doing an emergency stunning, poisoning, dumbing down, and then culling of the human population.
[00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:23.130]  And when you see their approach to animals, you see their same approach to us.
[00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:30.276]  The EU has laws that have been placed for more than a decade now that you don't take a sheep into a slaughterhouse and hit it in the head with a hammer.
[00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.252]  That's too crude, you know, it kills it pretty much right away, or knocks it out.
[00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:39.195]  You electrocute it, or you shock it and stun it unconscious, and then you butcher it.
[00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:57.304]  And so that's what they're doing, is poisoning us, dumbing us down with drugs and electromagnetic radiation, and all these other systems, and psychologically confusing us, taking God away from us, separating us from God, so we don't have any North Star, and then we'll be so stunned
[00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:12.022]  So diseased, so much in a mesmerized sleep state, that they'll be able to then go ahead and gut us, chop us up nicely, and end the species as we know it, so these super predators can play God.
[00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:17.064]  Imagine Bernie Madoff that stole $100 billion, roughly.
[00:07:20.543 --> 00:07:23.245]  Now imagine Bernie Madoff with his Ponzi scheme.
[00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:29.691]  He was an amateur compared to the private Federal Reserve and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the British Royal Family and others.
[00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:39.439]  And then when his Ponzi scheme went under, well, he got in a little bit of trouble because he was ripping off the establishment that was betting with him as well.
[00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.660]  He was kind of double-dipping.
[00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:45.704]  Well, the globalists have created thousands of quadrillions
[00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:51.370]  Not thousands of trillions, which is a quadrillion.
[00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.774]  It's now in the thousands of quadrillions.
[00:07:56.174 --> 00:08:02.660]  So the thousands of the thousands of the thousands of the thousands of the billions upon the trillions.
[00:08:04.462 --> 00:08:06.144]  There's more fiat money than there is
[00:08:09.138 --> 00:08:11.139]  Pretty much, I guess, atoms of the universe at some point.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.903]  Certainly more than there is sand at all the seashores on this planet and many others.
[00:08:16.483 --> 00:08:17.144]  It doesn't matter.
[00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:18.045]  It's all fiat.
[00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:24.109]  And they have decided that they own the world because they created all this digital made-up garbage.
[00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:25.530]  And now they need to get us in debt.
[00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.852]  They need to get rid of our local economies.
[00:08:28.492 --> 00:08:34.937]  They need to bankrupt us and put us into a position of total control.
[00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:37.399]  And that's what all of this is about.
[00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:43.515]  But here are the really huge, gigantic issues.
[00:08:44.556 --> 00:08:52.701]  That is that the globalists are moving us into a post-human world.
[00:08:55.162 --> 00:09:02.186]  And when I sit here and I say a post-human world, I mean a post-human world.
[00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:09.923]  And so that is the slide of where all of this is going.
[00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:15.491]  And as the crises intensify, the very people that are carrying it all out...
[00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:22.751]  are going to be the ones they're posing as our savior.
[00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:40.203]  And each new crisis they create, and each new crisis they exacerbate, and each new crisis they exploit, their corporate-controlled media will confuse and dumb down and create false hope to get the public to go deeper down the rat hole until it's too late and until they have absolutely no hope.
[00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:45.267]  I was gonna air a very special report this segment, but I'm gonna do it next segment now.
[00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:47.468]  And it's on Band.Video.
[00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.330]  So let me show you where it is.
[00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:51.907]  I'm going to go over there myself.
[00:09:51.927 --> 00:09:52.648]  I'm going to pull it up.
[00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:56.772]  There it is on screen for you.
[00:09:58.774 --> 00:10:04.280]  Fauci behind Wuhan COVID-19 leak, Washington Post reporter tells Joe Rogan.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.121]  Boy, that's a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:14.550]  And he told Joe this two days ago, and the media was smart enough to not take the bait and not talk about it.
[00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:21.493]  Oh, he'll talk about it if Joe says, hey, young people don't need to take the vaccine because they don't really get sick from COVID.
[00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:28.483]  They can attack that all day and claim he's not a scientist, though he's about to have major scientists on his show to document all that, little bird told me.
[00:10:34.073 --> 00:10:47.056]  But that's a big deal because we've already known that, but now the fact that it's starting to come out shows that the system is having real trouble getting other people within the system who thought they're part of the power structure to go along with their own destruction.
[00:10:47.376 --> 00:10:55.017]  And so that's the big announcement I want to just get out here to you on this Friday edition.
[00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:01.919]  That they've stolen the planet through fraud.
[00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:09.886]  And they believe that you're like weevils that have gotten into the grain supply in the pantry, and that you need to be exterminated.
[00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:15.554]  And when you act like a weevil, and don't stand up for yourself, and don't get informed, and don't organize...
[00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:21.276]  And don't demand innovation to empower humanity instead of enslaving humanity.
[00:11:21.516 --> 00:11:31.599]  And when you buy into the decadence and Satanism and unconsciousness that they're trying to sell you, you become what they claim you are in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:36.800]  And they will be able to then destroy you and your psyche and your soul and your mind.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.081]  And bind you to them forever.
[00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:43.503]  These are madmen.
[00:11:43.623 --> 00:11:53.507]  These are crazy people that take their psychotic will for total control and comport it into this system of saving the earth from the evil human infestation.
[00:11:54.867 --> 00:11:57.468]  These are the people Hitler only dreamed of being.
[00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:09.913]  These are the Rockefeller-funded bureaus that created the institutions that created Hitler, like the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute that grew out of the Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:12:11.653 --> 00:12:16.155]  And they know they can't launch a frontal assault on you.
[00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:23.798]  And so they do it by stealth.
[00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:26.989]  People ask, why are you so upset, Jones?
[00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:27.790]  Why do you have so much energy?
[00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.110]  Well, because I realize I'm being assaulted.
[00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.831]  I realize I'm being overtaken.
[00:12:32.071 --> 00:12:36.452]  I realize I'm being dominated and slayed by very bad people, and I don't take it kindly.
[00:12:37.112 --> 00:12:41.153]  And I have an instinct to resist it and to organize against it, and that's what we've done here.
[00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:46.315]  And if other people would take this seriously, we would be able to turn this around very quickly.
[00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:50.196]  But if we don't turn it around, it's going to get much worse very, very fast.
[00:12:50.396 --> 00:12:53.537]  And don't worry, you'll wake up and fight finally at one point,
[00:12:53.757 --> 00:12:54.938]  And we're going to win in the end.
[00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:57.520]  The question is, how bad does it have to get first?
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.863]  Because the globalists, just because they have a will to dominate and control, doesn't mean they've even thought it all through.
[00:13:03.143 --> 00:13:04.404]  Doesn't mean they're going to succeed.
[00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:11.789]  They have an instinct to enslave and rape and kill and dominate because it's who they are, inbred genetic psychopaths.
[00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:20.175]  And they've gotten away with it, and no one stood up to them, so they have just gone into an orgy of control freak behavior.
[00:13:23.263 --> 00:13:30.329]  So our acquiescence and our submission is a green light to this cult of devilish, diabolical control freaks.
[00:13:30.349 --> 00:13:33.751]  When we come back, the huge breaking news on so many fronts.
[00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:35.713]  I've got news even bigger than what I just mentioned.
[00:13:36.393 --> 00:13:40.076]  My friends, the globalist plan is controlled collapse of civilization.
[00:13:40.116 --> 00:13:44.059]  Food prices are set to go up 76% over the next six months.
[00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:47.442]  That's the Global Food Index by Bloomberg.
[00:13:47.462 --> 00:13:48.283]  It's very accurate.
[00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:52.621]  Amazon has tripled its profits, so most of the other big tech.
[00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:54.241]  Under the lockdown, it's only getting worse.
[00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:56.583]  Main Street is not bouncing back.
[00:13:56.643 --> 00:13:58.063]  The trucking companies are collapsing.
[00:13:58.384 --> 00:14:02.386]  There'll be one-third less gasoline this summer, so you'll be locked in your house.
[00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:07.468]  I mean, regardless, they have begun the accelerated collapse of the borders.
[00:14:08.409 --> 00:14:11.350]  They are preparing the riots this summer and civil war.
[00:14:11.971 --> 00:14:14.152]  And we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us next segment.
[00:14:14.512 --> 00:14:16.193]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:36.173]  Majority of French in a national poll agree with military generals that the country is heading towards civil war with an Islamic leftist takeover with police cars and police and others being killed and burned every night and their French puppet president has declared he's going to have the military arrested.
[00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:45.996]  And punished for daring to say that they are replacing the country with Islamists, even though their president announced a year ago, this is replacement migration.
[00:14:46.596 --> 00:14:47.516]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:14:47.556 --> 00:14:48.557]  The ADL says so.
[00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:52.297]  They rule, of course, America and the globalists rule Europe.
[00:14:53.138 --> 00:14:55.118]  And so that's that's how it is now.
[00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.719]  But let me get this part of a report.
[00:14:57.819 --> 00:14:59.819]  Gregory normally puts out three to five minute reports.
[00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:00.579]  They're all excellent.
[00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:03.940]  I called him up at six o'clock last night.
[00:15:04.861 --> 00:15:09.083]  And I said, Greg, will you stay late tonight and tomorrow morning and get out a report on this?
[00:15:09.183 --> 00:15:14.325]  Because Joe Rogan had the courage to have this guest on, who's a big investigative journalist at the Washington Post.
[00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:18.127]  And that was two days ago last night, three days ago today.
[00:15:18.287 --> 00:15:20.848]  And it didn't get any coverage because they know it's true.
[00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:30.533]  They don't want to attack Joe Rogan for, oh, you had a Washington Post reporter on about Fauci being behind the Wuhan lab and the leak and covering it up, which is true and which is huge.
[00:15:30.773 --> 00:15:33.294]  But to have this come out and Joe Rogan cover it is massive.
[00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:41.199]  If we can force this story out, this could really devastate the New World Order and their whole operation.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:49.385]  Because, again, it's the chutzpah, the bravado of Fauci and Gates running the Wuhan lab, having it moved from Chapel Hill.
[00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:57.711]  They're doing some damage control in this piece, not Joe, but the Washington Post reporter, defending Obama, saying, oh, Obama killed the program.
[00:15:57.751 --> 00:16:01.414]  No, Obama let the program be moved from North Carolina to Wuhan.
[00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:02.855]  I don't know.
[00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:20.084]  And that's Josh Rogin is the reporter.
[00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:20.464]  Here it is.
[00:16:20.724 --> 00:16:22.567]  Many of us have heard this before.
[00:16:23.568 --> 00:16:35.182]  In April of 2020, it was reported that Anthony Fauci funded dangerous gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab in China, dealing with bat coronavirus.
[00:16:36.644 --> 00:16:45.613]  And in early February of 2020, this was reported by Dr. Francis Boyle, writer of the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act.
[00:16:46.434 --> 00:16:52.140]  But the mainstream media machine never picked up the story, other than labeling it a conspiracy theory.
[00:16:53.038 --> 00:16:58.760]  The mainstream media has been loyally protecting Fauci while propping him up as our savior.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:05.302]  This is why Joe Rogan is currently being attacked in the mainstream media for being anti-vaccination.
[00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:15.565]  On the same day Rogan published his Josh Rogan episode, Media Matters published an article about an older episode dealing with vaccinations.
[00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:25.574]  Mainstream media ran with this old hot-button topic while ignoring the bombshell news that went out live to Rogan's massive audience.
[00:17:26.194 --> 00:17:30.919]  Josh Rogan is an American journalist who works for the Washington Post and CNN.
[00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:37.765]  He is part of the mainstream media machine, which makes his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast rather interesting.
[00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:39.147]  Here are the highlights.
[00:17:39.727 --> 00:17:41.788]  Okay, now here's the part where I'm going to get a little controversial.
[00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:42.208]  Are you ready?
[00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.048]  Mm-hmm.
[00:17:43.068 --> 00:17:43.469]  Is it okay?
[00:17:43.869 --> 00:17:44.089]  Sure.
[00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:57.915]  Okay, so if I've gotten you that far, again, just to say that I don't blame anyone out there for having this notion that, like, this lab accident theory is kind of a kooky thing that, like, was cooked up by Mike Pompeo or something like that.
[00:17:57.975 --> 00:17:58.835]  I get why you think that.
[00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:01.456]  But now Trump's not, he's not here anymore, right?
[00:18:01.496 --> 00:18:03.297]  We don't have to argue about Trump anymore, hopefully.
[00:18:04.153 --> 00:18:05.413]  Ever again, right?
[00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:14.536]  And we can just look at the piles of circumstantial evidence, and there's plenty of circumstantial evidence that it could have come... there's some circumstantial evidence that it could have come from nature.
[00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:20.358]  I feel that the lab theory has more compelling circumstantial evidence because, again, they were doing that kind of research.
[00:18:20.638 --> 00:18:25.859]  They also... there was a huge cover-up, and the virus database went mysteriously offline somehow in December 2019.
[00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:28.800]  There's also the evolution of the virus itself, right?
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.621]  That's where Robert... so Robert Redfield,
[00:18:31.564 --> 00:18:33.745]  Who was the CDC director at the time, a trained virologist.
[00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:41.267]  He says, I took a look at this virus and I concluded that it's so powerful that it must have been evolved in a lab setting.
[00:18:41.307 --> 00:18:45.048]  And he pointed to the gain-of-function research and they called him a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and all the rest.
[00:18:45.488 --> 00:18:45.728]  Yeah.
[00:18:45.888 --> 00:18:46.168]  All right.
[00:18:46.268 --> 00:18:49.349]  Now, here's the controversial part.
[00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:56.871]  The godfather of that industry, the head of the pyramid, is a guy you may have heard of called Anthony Fauci.
[00:18:57.112 --> 00:18:57.952]  I've heard of that guy.
[00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:00.633]  Yeah.
[00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:02.316]  Do you want to hear more?
[00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:02.797]  Yeah.
[00:19:03.198 --> 00:19:03.478]  Okay.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:13.614]  So, Anthony Fauci, the hero of the pandemic, is the most important person in the world of gain-of-function research there is.
[00:19:14.574 --> 00:19:34.870]  In other words, he is, not just him, there's Francis Collins at the NIH and some other people, but basically he is the one dispersing all of the grants for this, he is the one who pushed to turn it back on after Obama turned it back off, that's a whole other crazy story, he turned it back on without really consulting the White House, that's breaking news, never been reported, just broke some news on your show right now.
[00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:45.721]  Yes, he consulted the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which is like a part of the White House, but he didn't, you know, the White House put a pause on it, and then he like undid the pause.
[00:19:46.422 --> 00:19:47.623]  The details are a little sketchy.
[00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:49.905]  I'm not saying that he did anything necessarily
[00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:56.151]  Wrong or illegal, I'm just saying that a lot of people that I know inside the Trump administration had no idea this had turned back on.
[00:19:56.171 --> 00:19:59.654]  He found a way to turn it back on in the mess of the Trump administration.
[00:19:59.674 --> 00:20:02.336]  Because the Trump administration is full of a bunch of clowns, right?
[00:20:02.657 --> 00:20:05.639]  So at the end you could get stuff done if you just knew how to work the system.
[00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:07.160]  Fauci is the head of that system.
[00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:07.741]  Why?
[00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:08.862]  What was his incentive?
[00:20:10.646 --> 00:20:12.226]  That's everything, that's his whole career.
[00:20:12.707 --> 00:20:17.968]  So what he would say, and again, to be perfectly fair to him, he's trying to predict the next pandemic.
[00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.168]  He thinks this is the way that you predict the next pandemic.
[00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:28.311]  By digging up all these viruses, we've got to dig up more and more viruses and play around with them because we're going to find how they evolve, then we're going to come up with therapeutics and vaccines and all this stuff.
[00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:29.691]  But there were no therapeutics.
[00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:38.358]  Right, but we did have vaccines quicker than most because the DARPA funded a program to make mRNA vaccines 10 years.
[00:20:38.418 --> 00:20:39.899]  Okay, so let's put this on screen.
[00:20:40.099 --> 00:20:49.666]  The full report is on InfoWars.com right now, and the point is that mainstream media is now reporting this, but there is the new scientist report from six years ago.
[00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:50.447]  We put it back on screen.
[00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.652]  Pointing out that Chapel Hill did gain a function and then it got banned in the U.S.
[00:20:54.672 --> 00:20:59.915]  because scientists complained here, and then it got moved and actually Obama allowed it to be moved.
[00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:04.538]  So what that Josh Rogan is doing is damage control for the system.
[00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:07.299]  But it's still big news that he's up there saying all this.
[00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:09.521]  Remember what Dr. Francis Boyle said here 14 months ago?
[00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:14.884]  14 months ago, in late February, early March, he said,
[00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:20.535]  That they claim they're doing this to find out what's coming next, but really they're making bioweapons.
[00:21:21.176 --> 00:21:22.138]  And then it got out of the lab.
[00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:31.451]  And we know from the Indian Institutes and others, the British, the German, the discoverer of HIV scanned it with a CRISPR system and said it's five viruses cut together.
[00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:32.513]  It was manufactured.
[00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:36.053]  And I'm going to explain why it was manufactured more next hour.
[00:21:36.113 --> 00:21:44.742]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming on, but the full report, excellent job with all the back evidence by Greg Reese, is on Band.Video.
[00:21:45.002 --> 00:21:50.227]  The full Joe Rogan interview is on Spotify, and an excerpt of it is on Joe Rogan's YouTube channel.
[00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:51.748]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:52.149]  Stay with us.
[00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.051]  Ladies and gentlemen!
[00:21:55.441 --> 00:22:00.325]  You are tuned in to the most attacked, lied about, demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:04.909]  And despite being the most banned censored transmission on terra firma...
[00:22:05.885 --> 00:22:11.850]  We are the number one anti-globalist pro-human transmission in the world.
[00:22:12.651 --> 00:22:18.356]  And our view of the planet has been proven to be deadly accurate from the Globalist on reports of their own operations.
[00:22:19.016 --> 00:22:26.043]  That's why even Media Matters pulls their hair out and says, Rush Limbaugh now gone, Sean Hannity, Tugger Carlson.
[00:22:27.184 --> 00:22:29.125]  Why they're all clones of Alex Jones now.
[00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:29.606]  No they're not.
[00:22:31.052 --> 00:22:31.492]  No, they're not.
[00:22:31.773 --> 00:22:33.895]  They now understand the globalist operation.
[00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:37.278]  And once the blinders are off, they don't need to listen to me to know what's going on.
[00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:50.251]  Once the public figures out that globalism is meant to get rid of the nation-state, turn us all into third world slaves, and that they're going to use third world populations they've already enslaved, and that they've already abused, and they've already disenfranchised, as political
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.062]  And economic and physical weapons against the West.
[00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:58.584]  We can start turning this around on this Bombshell Friday Live.
[00:22:58.664 --> 00:23:03.467]  Washington Post investigation says Fauci behind Wuhan leak says he's the main suspect.
[00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:07.449]  Plus, 60% hospitalized with COVID in the U.S.
[00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:08.670]  It's breaking mainstream news.
[00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.512]  Received the Franken shot.
[00:23:12.449 --> 00:23:14.590]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.290]  60% of those now in hospitals got the shot.
[00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:17.871]  Wow!
[00:23:17.971 --> 00:23:19.291]  Of course it's making them sick.
[00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:20.752]  Then they tell them it's COVID.
[00:23:20.892 --> 00:23:21.852]  I predicted that.
[00:23:22.993 --> 00:23:28.955]  Joining us for the Balance of the Hour, we've got a bunch of other huge guests today, is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:23:28.975 --> 00:23:29.875]  I wanted to get him on.
[00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.396]  I've got Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com joining us.
[00:23:32.776 --> 00:23:33.756]  I host the Sunday Show.
[00:23:33.776 --> 00:23:35.397]  I'm hosting all four hours Sunday.
[00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:38.698]  And Paul has lived in France.
[00:23:39.775 --> 00:23:40.836]  He recently moved back.
[00:23:41.076 --> 00:23:42.257]  He lives in London again.
[00:23:43.137 --> 00:23:44.818]  And he can tell you what it's like.
[00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:48.221]  Five years ago, he went to no-go zones where the media said they didn't exist.
[00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:51.223]  He offered cash prizes to journalists and others.
[00:23:51.283 --> 00:23:52.744]  They went and found out indeed it was true.
[00:23:53.664 --> 00:23:58.727]  Majority of French agree with military generals that the country is heading towards civil war.
[00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:07.639]  There's basically a Marxist plan allied with Islam to destabilize and bring down the country and then have martial law used against the French indigenous.
[00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:14.286]  Macron said a year ago, we want 225 million people from the Middle East and Africa to be the new French.
[00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:16.749]  They want 600 plus million here in the U.S.
[00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.310]  replacement migration.
[00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:21.892]  So, Paul, explain to people what the generals said.
[00:24:22.993 --> 00:24:32.116]  The French puppet globalists are saying they want to arrest or punish these generals, but a new poll shows the vast majority of what's left of the French understand this is a takeover.
[00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:34.677]  And a lot of people say, oh, well, the French, they capitulated to Hitler.
[00:24:34.697 --> 00:24:35.277]  So, so what?
[00:24:35.737 --> 00:24:36.898]  The French are good people, folks.
[00:24:36.918 --> 00:24:38.919]  They've just been controlled by tyrants, like we are.
[00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:41.499]  We're all French tomorrow.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.960]  London is Lundistan.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.681]  Look at our borders, they're wide open.
[00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:51.243]  Okay, so France is the gateway to the UK and to the rest of Europe and the world.
[00:24:51.543 --> 00:24:53.144]  So we need to stand with the French people.
[00:24:53.244 --> 00:24:53.924]  They're good people.
[00:24:54.664 --> 00:24:55.965]  Paul, this is very serious.
[00:24:55.985 --> 00:24:56.665]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:01.727]  Well, this is an open letter sent to the government of France, Alex.
[00:25:01.947 --> 00:25:07.108]  And we've heard noises from these military personnel before, both active duty and retired, by the way.
[00:25:07.168 --> 00:25:08.429]  Many of them retired generals.
[00:25:09.252 --> 00:25:31.744]  Warning about this situation on the edges of the suburbs of major cities in France, and this mirrors across many major European capitals as well as other French cities such as Lyon, that you have this parallel society whereby it's completely undermined the French government and their monopoly of power, which is essentially what government is.
[00:25:32.684 --> 00:25:34.225]  Because whenever, for example,
[00:25:35.177 --> 00:25:42.682]  And this mirrors in America with Black Lives Matter, you have a violent confrontation between a violent criminal in a French city and the police.
[00:25:43.202 --> 00:25:56.530]  When the police go in to try to deal with the crime, not only are they attacked on the scene, but then there is days, weeks of rioting as a result of the police simply trying to go in and enforce law and order.
[00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:02.374]  And not just the police, we're talking about fire trucks, we're talking about ambulance crews, who were attacked
[00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:07.008]  Who are stoned when they merely go into these areas and try to do their job.
[00:26:07.868 --> 00:26:26.237]  So now they're warning about it, in this open letter signed by a thousand service members, including 20 retired generals, that there are dangers threatening France and that basically there needs to be a reconquering of these areas in order to restore any kind of order
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:35.848]  In these banlieus, in these ghetto migrant areas of France, that the media for the past six years, Alex, have said were a complete conspiracy theory.
[00:26:36.308 --> 00:26:49.981]  And as he said, the main point of this is they did a poll afterwards, despite the recriminations against all these top generals saying they'd be punished, 59% of the French population said they supported them and agreed with them.
[00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:52.283]  So if they tried to brush this off once again,
[00:26:53.072 --> 00:26:57.478]  By saying it's these extreme, radical, fringe, right-wing military generals.
[00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:02.104]  No it isn't, because the majority of the population now agrees with their view.
[00:27:02.405 --> 00:27:06.190]  And that is a massive sea change that we've seen over the past few years.
[00:27:07.819 --> 00:27:22.687]  And Paul, let's be clear, when they talk about a La Reconquista, we could show hours of footage every day of burning police cars, burning buildings, thousands of people landing, running around, raping, killing all over Spain, all over Italy, all over Greece, all over everywhere.
[00:27:22.727 --> 00:27:26.810]  I mean, it is like something like out of Day of the Dead going on here.
[00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:33.875]  And now, terrorism's went down 80% in Paris, it's plunging in London, even before the COVID lockdown.
[00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:37.577]  Oh, but even during the lockdown, they still keep bringing the invaders in.
[00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:38.658]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:52.328]  So, anybody can type in the Reconquering of Spain, La Reconquista, and you can see how it took 400 years for the Spanish to take back what was medieval Spain when the Islamists had taken it over.
[00:27:54.093 --> 00:28:00.995]  Yeah, and you can see this every time, for example, there's an African Cup of Nations tournament, because France has a ton of Algerian immigrants.
[00:28:01.795 --> 00:28:03.816]  In 2019, we covered this story.
[00:28:04.156 --> 00:28:06.457]  They rampaged through the streets of Paris.
[00:28:06.497 --> 00:28:08.077]  They attacked French citizens.
[00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:13.359]  And in their own words, this is not us talking about, oh, the conspiracy theory of the Great Replacement.
[00:28:13.699 --> 00:28:14.559]  This is what they said.
[00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:16.080]  We had the story at the time on camera.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:23.682]  While they were rampaging through the streets with chainsaws, attacking statues, dragging down Charles de Gaulle statues,
[00:28:24.486 --> 00:28:30.134]  One of them said to camera, quote, France used to colonize us, but today we colonize them.
[00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.116]  So that's in their own words.
[00:28:32.176 --> 00:28:36.021]  Another one said we conquered Paris faster than the Germans.
[00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.463]  It only took us three hours.
[00:28:37.964 --> 00:28:38.605]  Meanwhile,
[00:28:39.548 --> 00:28:53.162]  As they're tearing down Charles de Gaulle statues, the socialist mayor of Paris is on the streets with them, dancing in the streets with them, after the beheading of the school teacher last year, Samuel Paty, in Paris.
[00:28:53.223 --> 00:28:55.905]  And they have these beheadings every few months at this point, Alex.
[00:28:57.107 --> 00:29:00.030]  The French ambassador to Sweden, Etienne de Gonneville,
[00:29:00.643 --> 00:29:04.986]  told SVT broadcaster, quote, France is a Muslim country.
[00:29:05.446 --> 00:29:09.949]  So it's that dual attack on the yellow vests, on the working class in France.
[00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:16.194]  It's not just the radicalised migrants that have been brought in that's saying openly this is recolonisation.
[00:29:16.794 --> 00:29:23.238]  It's the members of the government saying, yes, you're right, we're a Muslim country now, go ahead and take over.
[00:29:23.298 --> 00:29:27.141]  And these military generals warning against it, they're the bad guys.
[00:29:27.681 --> 00:29:29.102]  What is wrong with the French?
[00:29:29.162 --> 00:29:29.903]  What is wrong with the Brits?
[00:29:29.923 --> 00:29:30.784]  What's wrong with Americans?
[00:29:31.244 --> 00:29:33.946]  I mean, we make fun of the French capitulating to Hitler so quickly.
[00:29:34.286 --> 00:29:35.607]  Well, they're capitulating to Islam.
[00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:36.748]  So is the UK.
[00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:37.949]  So is the US.
[00:29:37.989 --> 00:29:38.689]  So are we all.
[00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:40.491]  Because we have traitors in our governments.
[00:29:40.851 --> 00:29:44.654]  Why the hell would the elites want to sell us out to this type of crap?
[00:29:46.499 --> 00:29:52.783]  Well, because they want a complete monopoly on the class system where they're not going to get challenged.
[00:29:53.104 --> 00:30:01.890]  And if they let these people have their little territories where they can practice Sharia law, where they can set up parallel legal systems, which is exactly what's happening.
[00:30:02.546 --> 00:30:06.607]  They're fine with that happening, and sod all the working class French people.
[00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:14.088]  You know, some of these areas, Alex, are 50%, 60% migrants in France, but they're still 40% of the native population.
[00:30:14.108 --> 00:30:18.269]  I mean, wait a minute, the New York Times said there is no no-go zones, there is no Muslim violence.
[00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:20.830]  Oh, it was interesting.
[00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.410]  This is another aspect of it, the media cover-up, right?
[00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.331]  They said there were no-go zones because some guy on Fox News said that
[00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.975]  Birmingham was completely Muslim and they said, well, that's wrong.
[00:30:31.015 --> 00:30:33.817]  That means there are no go zones as a very concept.
[00:30:33.837 --> 00:30:34.377]  Doesn't exist.
[00:30:34.457 --> 00:30:35.478]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:36.739]  It exists.
[00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:42.444]  In Sweden, the postal service won't even deliver parcels to some areas because they get attacked.
[00:30:42.744 --> 00:30:44.165]  The postmen get attacked.
[00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:46.227]  Oh, but no go zones don't exist.
[00:30:46.607 --> 00:30:48.449]  You have the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
[00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:54.692]  I was watching it live, Facebook Live, Muslims on the live feed celebrating the attack.
[00:30:54.732 --> 00:31:06.465]  BuzzFeed comes out with a hit piece and says that was a hoax because we didn't know what they were celebrating while the live video of the cathedral was there on the top of the post burning in the background.
[00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:07.787]  So the media covers it.
[00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:09.749]  All we know is the UN admits a
[00:31:09.929 --> 00:31:13.652]  Doubling 10 years ago of Christian persecution, now a tripling worldwide.
[00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:17.034]  So if you're a Christian anywhere in the world, the Muslims are killing you, including Africa.
[00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.857]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson about what's coming next.
[00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:20.377]  Stay with us.
[00:31:20.397 --> 00:31:28.183]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News, what an excellent site, is joining us right now.
[00:31:28.203 --> 00:31:33.367]  He hosts every fourth hour on Tuesdays, and also joins us for special events and reports.
[00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:38.531]  He also does some reporting for him for wars out of Europe when he is visiting his family that's moved there to Spain.
[00:31:39.568 --> 00:31:45.470]  Paul, pulling back here for the whole Alex Jones audience, tune into the Alex Jones Show here.
[00:31:47.050 --> 00:32:00.894]  I mean, you wrote an article three years ago that was the top story on Twitter, where you quoted the UN and linked to them saying, and their own website, UN.org, saying we're going to have 600 plus million replacement in the US.
[00:32:02.034 --> 00:32:02.515]  I don't know.
[00:32:19.594 --> 00:32:22.996]  And then when Lou Dobbs covers it, they threaten to fire him on Fox saying it doesn't exist.
[00:32:23.497 --> 00:32:31.843]  How are they going to have this paradox where they had the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center say you were a liar, had Snopes say you were a liar, when all you're doing is pointing at them?
[00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:36.166]  It's like Fiona Hill from the State Department that was on 60 Minutes and in congressional hearings.
[00:32:37.106 --> 00:32:39.408]  He goes, Alex Jones is lying about me.
[00:32:39.928 --> 00:32:41.689]  I don't know what a globalist is.
[00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.651]  I don't know George Soros.
[00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:44.291]  These are quotes.
[00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:47.614]  She was the head of his Open Society on the board.
[00:32:48.094 --> 00:32:49.555]  She was the head of the board, chair of the board.
[00:32:50.216 --> 00:32:53.658]  She is the main writer at theglobalist.com.
[00:32:54.318 --> 00:32:58.081]  I mean, it's like Hitler saying, I don't know what a Nazi is in 1942.
[00:32:58.602 --> 00:33:00.283]  It's like Superman saying, I don't know what a
[00:33:01.684 --> 00:33:05.310]  What Krypton is, I mean, it's just, what is up with this gaslighting?
[00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:14.046]  Because we're under full Islamic globalist invasion, we're under full New World Order invasion, our borders are gone, we're all being attacked by the same globalists, and they just say it doesn't exist, Paul.
[00:33:15.546 --> 00:33:26.110]  Well, it's that old trick that they've pulled for well over a decade now, where if you talk about it and you say it's bad, then it's a conspiracy theory, it doesn't exist, you need to be censored because you're a dangerous radical.
[00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:33.253]  But if you talk about the exact same subject and say it's a good thing, then it's a good thing and you're part of the team, right?
[00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:44.038]  Joe Biden came out many times years ago and said the browning of America was a great thing, the replacement of white people in America was a great thing because it allows them to import a voting bloc.
[00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:45.812]  I mean, we've had studies.
[00:33:46.712 --> 00:33:48.593]  Again, they say diversity is a strength.
[00:33:48.613 --> 00:33:53.736]  They had a big study out of Copenhagen University, and they looked at every single metric.
[00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:59.599]  They studied a thousand different cases and said, no, it increases community tensions.
[00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:00.779]  It increases crime.
[00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:05.482]  It increases depression and dislocation amongst people living in society.
[00:34:05.942 --> 00:34:06.882]  It does not work.
[00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:09.844]  And that's evidence in France, in Belgium.
[00:34:10.604 --> 00:34:11.805]  You mentioned it before the break.
[00:34:12.563 --> 00:34:18.769]  We literally got chased out of one of these no-go zones while the media at the time was saying they didn't exist.
[00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:26.938]  This was immediately after the panic... Let's be clear, they wouldn't give you service at gas stations, at restaurants, at pubs, at drugstores.
[00:34:27.378 --> 00:34:30.542]  Whole areas you were refused and told, leave, you are white.
[00:34:31.843 --> 00:34:43.490]  Yeah, and we know why, because we went into Molenbeek, Brussels, where one of the main Paris massacre terrorists was being hidden, protected, by that community.
[00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:54.337]  And he stayed there, in a major European city, protected, after carrying out one of the most vicious, brutal attacks in history, for four months, without being discovered.
[00:34:54.677 --> 00:34:57.098]  And then they say, oh well, it's not all Muslims.
[00:34:57.539 --> 00:34:59.860]  No, not all Muslims are going to carry out terror attacks, but
[00:35:00.543 --> 00:35:10.556]  How can somebody who's responsible for such an atrocity, subject to one of the largest manhunts in European history, be protected by a community that has nothing to do with it?
[00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:11.197]  Well, exactly.
[00:35:11.277 --> 00:35:13.480]  If 5% were against him, he would have gotten caught.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.341]  No, they were all for it.
[00:35:14.382 --> 00:35:15.122]  And let's expand on that.
[00:35:15.503 --> 00:35:17.244]  It's not that brown people are, quote, bad.
[00:35:17.264 --> 00:35:29.613]  It's that the UN exploits their countries, collapses them, puts them in refugee centers for three to six months, brainwashes them, brings them into leftist areas to be controlled by radical imams and leftists who then milk part of the welfare off of them.
[00:35:29.633 --> 00:35:31.295]  It's the same scam globally.
[00:35:31.655 --> 00:35:40.902]  And so now, as soon as brown people became the majority now in the United States and areas of Europe, as soon as that happened, then the media tells us white people are bad.
[00:35:41.142 --> 00:35:44.865]  So they're literally trying to invoke the brown populations they've brought in
[00:35:45.365 --> 00:35:46.626]  To then hate white people.
[00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:48.687]  This is classic divide and conquer, Paul.
[00:35:50.688 --> 00:35:51.208]  Precisely.
[00:35:51.248 --> 00:35:53.269]  I mean, we mentioned the terror attacks.
[00:35:53.669 --> 00:36:04.574]  There are numerous high-profile cases in France, not just the Paris Massacre, which, by the way, the majority of the Paris Massacre terrorists were brought in on the refugee wave.
[00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:07.856]  They entered France as refugees.
[00:36:08.236 --> 00:36:11.958]  The guy who beheaded the schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, was a refugee.
[00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:13.739]  He was given residency permits.
[00:36:14.403 --> 00:36:24.168]  The person who beheaded a woman and two others in Nice, next to a church, was a boat migrant who literally arrived on the refugee wave.
[00:36:24.188 --> 00:36:27.290]  So we have numerous solid examples of that.
[00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:37.836]  But again, you have the media covering it up and, as I mentioned with the Buzzfeed, they literally came out and said it was a hoax, that Muslims were celebrating the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
[00:36:38.556 --> 00:36:42.098]  Because they said, oh, we don't know what they were celebrating, okay.
[00:36:42.862 --> 00:36:50.348]  So it was a live feed of the biggest news event in months with the video of the Notre Dame Cathedral burning in the background.
[00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:52.709]  And they said, oh, we don't know their religion.
[00:36:52.990 --> 00:37:00.675]  It's just Mohammed sending a smiley emoticon and, you know, Habib and Abdul sending a thumbs up emoticon.
[00:37:00.975 --> 00:37:06.980]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang for like three hours straight on a Facebook live stream with the cathedral burning in the background.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.641]  They came out and said it was a hoax.
[00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:10.042]  They said it was a hoax.
[00:37:10.062 --> 00:37:11.183]  They later had to delete it.
[00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:14.244]  And Paul, all over the world, Christians aren't allowed.
[00:37:14.484 --> 00:37:21.066]  Muslims don't allow Christian churches, except maybe if you're in Syria, and those are getting bombed by outside jihadis that Obama funds.
[00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:28.688]  I mean, the fact is Islam does not live in peace with any other religion but Islam, and different factions of Islam continually kill each other.
[00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:33.670]  They need a reformation, just like when Catholics and Protestants were killing each other for 500 years.
[00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.890]  It needs to stop.
[00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:46.423]  There are many examples of these migrant ghettos in Paris and other cities where the refugees are embroiled in running street battles with each other.
[00:37:46.924 --> 00:37:50.148]  In fact, I think I sent a video to your producer which shows one of them in Paris.
[00:37:50.528 --> 00:37:52.351]  You talk about the attacks on churches.
[00:37:53.303 --> 00:37:59.724]  In an average year in France, this is 2018, there were 1,062 anti-Christian acts.
[00:38:00.124 --> 00:38:06.666]  Now, compare that to anti-Muslim acts, we're always told that, you know, anti-Muslim Islamophobia is a big problem everywhere.
[00:38:06.986 --> 00:38:10.827]  Just 100 in comparison, one-tenth the amount.
[00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:18.208]  We see numerous examples of the Virgin Mary being beheaded, even in local little villages in France.
[00:38:18.268 --> 00:38:21.589]  An average of two churches a day are vandalised in France.
[00:38:22.435 --> 00:38:31.337]  Then the Notre Dame Cathedral fire happens and within three hours the media is saying, oh my God, how dare these people even suggest that this might have been deliberate.
[00:38:31.657 --> 00:38:41.320]  When churches are being attacked and burned down in France on a daily basis, Jews are fleeing Paris because of the hate crime attacks against them.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:50.042]  Yet we're supposed to bow to these imams, as he said, and these clerics who radicalize these individuals and expand this parallel society.
[00:38:50.731 --> 00:38:53.333]  That's got France in such a big deal.
[00:38:53.373 --> 00:39:05.160]  How do the globalists, because they admit their own documents that you've written so many articles about, they admit they're doing this to destabilize, take over, collapse society, then they'll be in these special armored city areas and rural areas controlled, we'll all be living in squalor.
[00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:06.882]  How do they think they'll get away with this?
[00:39:06.942 --> 00:39:12.485]  Why would they destabilize the whole world just to be, just because they love madness, they love insanity?
[00:39:12.505 --> 00:39:15.767]  Because you know, Hitler said, I just like war and burning buildings.
[00:39:15.807 --> 00:39:16.928]  He just loved the death.
[00:39:17.248 --> 00:39:19.370]  And he wasn't actually trying to build anything, he just wanted to blow everything up.
[00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:33.381]  I think some of them genuinely have this post-colonial hangover of white guilt, where they're so ensconced within their ivory towers that they feel completely guilty of the luxurious lifestyles that they live.
[00:39:33.781 --> 00:39:45.872]  But the net effect of it, Alex, is, you know, Michel Houellebecq, who is a famed French intellectual and author, published on the day of the Charlie Hebdo massacre a book called Submission.
[00:39:46.474 --> 00:40:04.625]  And he predicted, before Charlie Hebdo happened, that you would have so much violence, so much dislocation in society, as a result of the failure to integrate these large Muslim migrant populations, that there would be a Muslim coalition government, which would take power in the name of... Hold on, Paul, you gotta go, we gotta go to break.
[00:40:04.645 --> 00:40:05.766]  Do five more minutes with us.
[00:40:05.846 --> 00:40:09.248]  We have the Canadian pastor that's been raided by the police multiple times.
[00:40:09.668 --> 00:40:12.170]  Now they say they're going to come with force and shut him down.
[00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.031]  We've got an update from him coming up.
[00:40:14.592 --> 00:40:17.094]  Also, we've got a lawyer coming on that's filed lawsuits in Connecticut.
[00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:19.756]  They're filing other suits to stop forced inoculation.
[00:40:20.196 --> 00:40:22.478]  It is all coming up today.
[00:40:22.758 --> 00:40:24.139]  We've got a jam-packed transmission.
[00:40:24.159 --> 00:40:29.143]  Plus, we have a medical doctor coming on to expose how dangerous the COVID vaccines are that aren't vaccines.
[00:40:29.643 --> 00:40:38.010]  And a top-level genetic engineer and scientist has come out and said that the majority of people now being admitted to hospitals
[00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.293]  Are there because they had vaccine damage and they're calling it COVID-19.
[00:40:42.613 --> 00:40:43.133]  That is huge.
[00:40:43.153 --> 00:40:48.457]  We'll come up with Paul Watson to finish up with the big information out of France and so much more.
[00:40:48.537 --> 00:40:49.278]  Please don't forget.
[00:40:50.138 --> 00:41:00.386]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is wonderful for your immune system, wonderful for your joints, wonderful for detoxing, wonderful for your bones, for everything.
[00:41:01.006 --> 00:41:04.469]  It is available 50% off even though it's been sold out for months.
[00:41:04.889 --> 00:41:06.310]  But we got a limited supply of it.
[00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.752]  So the 50% off is going to end Tuesday morning.
[00:41:09.112 --> 00:41:12.654]  Vazzo Beats will extend that about a week, but that'll be selling out too.

[00:41:44.794 --> 00:41:49.437]  All right, final segment with Paul Joseph Watson as we kick off the second hour here.
[00:41:49.477 --> 00:41:52.458]  We've got another jam-packed three hours lined up for you here today.
[00:41:52.478 --> 00:41:55.120]  Paul, you were getting into the famous French intellectual
[00:41:56.428 --> 00:42:02.718]  Not even a right-winger coming out with a best-selling book that came out the day Charlie Hebdo got shot up for their satirical cartoons.
[00:42:02.738 --> 00:42:05.022]  They do them against Jesus, against Buddha, against everybody.
[00:42:05.643 --> 00:42:06.865]  And that's their right, free speech.
[00:42:08.152 --> 00:42:19.701]  I noticed when I was over in the UK for 7-7 14 years ago with you, that I'd just be filming Big Ben or whatever and Muslims would walk over in their nightgowns and say, you do not do that!
[00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:22.583]  Like they thought I was a Brit who were so polite, I guess they bow down.
[00:42:23.043 --> 00:42:24.104]  I'd start yelling back at them.
[00:42:24.144 --> 00:42:25.085]  I don't even hate Muslims.
[00:42:25.145 --> 00:42:26.125]  I just love being pushed around.
[00:42:26.566 --> 00:42:31.610]  But it seems the niceness of the French, the niceness of the Brits, the niceness of the Germans, everybody.
[00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:39.577]  Everybody's being told to stay in their houses, water cannons, police running women over, but you're told that the Muslims can do whatever they want.
[00:42:39.597 --> 00:42:45.642]  I mean, I saw the footage of Muslims say, execute the homosexuals, but a Christian street preacher got arrested a few days ago.
[00:42:45.942 --> 00:42:47.184]  We can roll that footage over this.
[00:42:48.665 --> 00:42:51.327]  He got arrested for simply saying that it's
[00:42:52.785 --> 00:42:54.827]  In the Bible, it's not good to be homosexual.
[00:42:56.508 --> 00:43:02.993]  Seriously, it's free game and open season on indigenous populations of Europe.
[00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:03.654]  What's going on?
[00:43:03.674 --> 00:43:05.255]  And finish up your point about Charlie Hebdo.
[00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:13.840]  Yeah, Charlie Hebdo, Michel Welbeck, famed French author and intellectual, published the book, so he'd already written it.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:24.303]  It was published on the day of the Charlie Hebdo massacre and he predicted that there would be so much discord and violence because of these Muslim communities that have not been integrated and that hate France.
[00:43:24.803 --> 00:43:36.426]  Allied with the left-wing protest movement, by the way, ISIS literally puts out in their manifesto that they can make an alliance with the left wing because they also hate France and the West to bring it down.
[00:43:37.026 --> 00:43:50.175]  So he puts out a book on the day of Charlie Hebdo warning that the contrived solution to all this would be a Muslim government in a coalition with a left-wing government that takes power and promises to get it all under control.
[00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:52.356]  Now the first part of that happened.
[00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:59.221]  What's interesting is that his book after that, his subsequent book after submission, was called Serotonin.
[00:43:59.821 --> 00:44:02.263]  And that predicted, because of the brutal crackdown,
[00:44:03.047 --> 00:44:31.231]  Not on these migrant Muslim populations that will riot and burn down cities for days on end, will attack people in the streets, but on the yellow vest movement and the working class populist movement in France as a result of that crackdown, which is the only crackdown that's taking place in France, there will be further radicalization, not even on the right, but just amongst disaffected working class people in France, especially out in the countryside in the farming community.
[00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:40.172]  Now that's being percolated down into support for Marine Le Pen, who has supported this letter by the military generals.
[00:44:40.572 --> 00:44:55.517]  So whether there's a political solution to this remains to be seen, but should Le Pen run in the next election, which it looks like she's going to do, she may give Macron a close run for his money if he doesn't pay attention to this problem, which from all indications
[00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.211]  is not taking place.
[00:44:57.491 --> 00:45:10.622]  So there could still be a political solution, but if not, as Welbeck predicted, and he predicted the first part of it, it could only lead to more vulcanization, violence, and in fact, as these generals warn, civil war.
[00:45:11.383 --> 00:45:15.607]  And while we're all fighting with each other, the globalists are rolling out their war garment takeover in closing.
[00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:30.408]  They admit in a lot of the Davos Great Reset documents that the Great Reset's meant to shut down populists like Trump, Bolsonaro, and then make people like the British Prime Minister, who claimed he was a patriot, get in line, which obviously Boris Johnson has done.
[00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:42.336]  And so really, I mean, the lockdown is about punishing nationalists and patriots and populists and making us forget about us complaining about wanting our freedoms back because we're just busy trying to get outside our house.
[00:45:42.557 --> 00:45:44.378]  It's basically martial law by the globalists.
[00:45:45.728 --> 00:46:02.297]  Yeah, and by the same token, on the same point of these parallel societies being allowed to be created, the French government literally came out before the first coronavirus lockdown, the Ministry of the Interior, and said that it shouldn't be enforced in these migrant ghetto areas.
[00:46:02.637 --> 00:46:13.343]  So again, literally creating a separate law where the enforcement, the lockdown, the oppression imposed on us is not imposed on them because they're a specially protected class.
[00:46:14.887 --> 00:46:17.729]  Summit.News, I love checking out the site.
[00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:19.370]  Glad you're out there, Paul.
[00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:23.533]  We're proud of the work you're doing at Summit.News and collaborating with InfoWars.com.
[00:46:24.313 --> 00:46:25.434]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:26.255 --> 00:46:26.635]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:28.576]  It's got a story up there.
[00:46:28.616 --> 00:46:30.258]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:30.298 --> 00:46:33.139]  Hysterical imbeciles cancel the latest Jeopardy!
[00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:33.620]  champion.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.081]  You know, OK symbol.
[00:46:36.343 --> 00:46:38.023]  That's all the control.
[00:46:38.544 --> 00:46:40.804]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:46:40.924 --> 00:46:41.464]  to 3 p.m.
[00:46:41.505 --> 00:46:41.865]  Central.
[00:46:42.565 --> 00:46:46.066]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we've got a jam-packed transmission.
[00:46:46.106 --> 00:46:47.526]  We're now into hour number two.
[00:46:48.106 --> 00:46:51.347]  We've got a lot of guests coming on for only one segment today to give us updates on what's happening.
[00:46:51.407 --> 00:46:57.309]  Next segment, the biggest news yet in the whole COVID martial law world government takeover.
[00:46:57.789 --> 00:46:58.569]  It's now official.
[00:46:58.609 --> 00:47:03.531]  They're parroting from the BBC to CNN to ABC Australia that
[00:47:04.761 --> 00:47:07.622]  You will get your freedom when you have your vaccine.
[00:47:07.902 --> 00:47:10.764]  The moment of freedom for you is when you get your vaccine.
[00:47:11.144 --> 00:47:13.925]  These are the quotes everywhere, and it gets even crazier.
[00:47:14.405 --> 00:47:24.730]  Top scientists, epidemiologists, you name it, are coming out and saying, Yale medical doctors, that the majority of people in the hospitals now are from the vaccine, and they're telling people that they have COVID.
[00:47:25.671 --> 00:47:26.211]  Wow!
[00:47:26.751 --> 00:47:27.651]  We predicted that.
[00:47:27.772 --> 00:47:30.773]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:31.573 --> 00:47:32.654]  But I wanted to get
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:47.732]  Artur Polosky, or Art Polosky, the great preacher that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week, and who has his little church that's been raided a bunch by the provincial police and others, and now with a SWAT team to give us an update, streetchurch.ca.
[00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.593]  He was on Monday.
[00:47:50.254 --> 00:47:51.915]  Their services are coming up this weekend.
[00:47:52.376 --> 00:47:54.978]  They may try to lock the church up like they've done many others.
[00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:58.921]  He's saying he's going to go to one of the places like Walmart or wherever.
[00:47:58.941 --> 00:48:00.562]  He's going to announce it via email to his flock.
[00:48:01.323 --> 00:48:18.975]  And so they'll have it where they do allow it, because you see, they're allowing games in Europe, they're allowing Ranger games in Texas, they're doing stuff, they have UFC stuff in Florida, Europe's opening back up, but churches particularly are being targeted and, of course, Jewish conservative synagogues.
[00:48:19.295 --> 00:48:20.275]  And so here's the headlines.
[00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:26.640]  Calgary court issues warrant permitting police to quote, do anything necessary to enter pastor's church and arrest him.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.882]  Daily Wire reports Calgary police obtained secret warrant
[00:48:30.362 --> 00:48:33.409]  He used, quote, any force necessary to disrupt church services.
[00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.373]  So talk about jumping the shark.
[00:48:35.754 --> 00:48:39.682]  Thank you for joining us, Pastor, to give us an update on one of the latest developments.
[00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:43.909]  Thank you very much, Alex, for having me in.
[00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:45.890]  Yes, it's absolutely crazy.
[00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.492]  They're pushing, they're pushing, they're pushing.
[00:48:48.752 --> 00:48:51.114]  But I think the people are starting to push as well.
[00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:59.559]  Tomorrow is our next church service, and I've had hundreds of people saying that they're coming tomorrow to the church service.
[00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:02.301]  So if you're in Calgary area, come and support us.
[00:49:02.321 --> 00:49:07.224]  They're going to surround the church, and they're going to say after our dead body.
[00:49:07.324 --> 00:49:09.205]  What happened was, which is incredible,
[00:49:10.786 --> 00:49:19.092]  Police and the health inspectors received a permission from a judge to use any force necessary.
[00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:24.697]  And the judge's name, that's even more fascinating in the story, is David Gates.
[00:49:24.877 --> 00:49:31.102]  Out of 7 billion names, they have found a judge that is a family of Bill Gates.
[00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:31.702]  I don't know.
[00:49:31.762 --> 00:49:39.268]  David Gates, the judge here in Calgary, gave them permission to enter anytime they want with whomever they want.
[00:49:39.528 --> 00:49:41.389]  During church service from 8 a.m.
[00:49:41.449 --> 00:49:42.230]  to 8 p.m.
[00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:50.915]  any day, any time, and they can use any force that they wish that is necessary, and they can arrest me.
[00:49:51.756 --> 00:49:52.476]  Listen to this.
[00:49:53.317 --> 00:50:06.685]  The judge is giving the law enforcement authorization to do anything necessary to carry out the arrest, including the use of as much reasonable force as may be necessary to make the arrest, and without a warrant.
[00:50:06.705 --> 00:50:08.526]  You see, they're saying to you and me,
[00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:11.429]  That they can come to my house and arrest me without warrant.
[00:50:11.449 --> 00:50:12.870]  They don't need a warrant anymore.
[00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.671]  The judge says so.
[00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:16.534]  The judge is God and the judge says you don't need anything else.
[00:50:16.554 --> 00:50:22.920]  Well, they're doing this under the general declaration of an emergency, which when you have an emergency that gets rid of all the basic rights, that has a name.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.061]  It's called martial law.
[00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:26.152]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:50:26.412 --> 00:50:30.336]  And they can make an arrest without warrants to enter any place, any place.
[00:50:31.237 --> 00:50:37.903]  And where on reasonable grounds, law enforcement believes that the offending person may be found.
[00:50:38.003 --> 00:50:43.888]  Actually, right now, while we are live here on TV, I can be arrested at any moment.
[00:50:43.908 --> 00:50:45.570]  They can break the door to my house.
[00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:46.791]  They can break the door to my
[00:50:47.011 --> 00:50:48.613]  What about Doug Ford, the Premier over in Montreal?
[00:50:48.633 --> 00:50:49.634]  He's super unpopular.
[00:50:49.654 --> 00:50:52.277]  He came out and declared total martial law.
[00:50:52.377 --> 00:50:54.779]  Can't be on the street anytime.
[00:50:54.919 --> 00:50:55.800]  We're going to question you.
[00:51:10.055 --> 00:51:20.597]  And people got really, really upset, so they came out and gave a press conference and basically apologized and backed off because the police said, we're not going to enforce martial law.
[00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:21.877]  That term was even used.
[00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:25.538]  So it seems like some sanity is starting to pop up here and there.
[00:51:25.918 --> 00:51:34.580]  Why are the police so happy in your area and in other areas with other churches to put fences up around them and to behave like something out of Soviet Russia?
[00:51:35.996 --> 00:51:42.040]  Because the mayor, the homosexual Muslim mayor, Nayed Nenshi, threatened to defund the police.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.862]  He took $20 million out of the police budget.
[00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:48.384]  And then, after a backlash, she gave them back the $20 million.
[00:51:48.404 --> 00:51:49.004]  Well, that's what it is.
[00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:49.445]  Exactly.
[00:51:49.465 --> 00:51:52.407]  The left everywhere is holding the police hostage by the purse strings.
[00:51:52.427 --> 00:51:53.427]  They don't want to get rid of the police.
[00:51:53.727 --> 00:51:57.590]  They want the police shutting down churches, not stopping carjackers.
[00:51:58.666 --> 00:52:00.527]  That's exactly what is happening right now.
[00:52:00.847 --> 00:52:04.508]  The crime in the city of Calgary is like three times more than it was before.
[00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:10.630]  And yet you've got such a huge amount of police, hundreds of police officers during our Christmas celebration.
[00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:19.612]  Now you've got a gang suppression team, a SWAT team, harassing not the drug dealers, not the murderers, gangsters.
[00:52:19.753 --> 00:52:23.354]  No, they're coming to suppress, to attack, to intimidate, to harass.
[00:52:23.394 --> 00:52:23.774]  Well, that's huge.
[00:52:23.794 --> 00:52:24.834]  They've got the gangs.
[00:52:24.854 --> 00:52:27.355]  I saw on the news, your crime rate's tripled.
[00:52:28.536 --> 00:52:33.400]  Super bad murders, robberies, rapes, but they because the gang suppression units at your church!
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:33.841]  Oh my!
[00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:35.642]  They're calling your church a gang!
[00:52:35.763 --> 00:52:36.163]  Wow!
[00:52:36.443 --> 00:52:37.664]  A criminal organization!
[00:52:37.825 --> 00:52:39.967]  So they're literally criminalizing churches now!
[00:52:40.984 --> 00:52:42.405]  That's exactly what is happening.
[00:52:42.725 --> 00:52:51.951]  I mean, I can't even, with a clear conscience, call this, you know, this beloved country of mine, democracy, because it's not democracy anymore.
[00:52:52.292 --> 00:52:53.973]  It's a police state.
[00:52:54.793 --> 00:52:58.476]  Our rights have been taken away from us, so we can't do anything anymore.
[00:52:58.816 --> 00:53:05.040]  Right now, the Premier of Alberta said that he's going to penalize those that are getting tickets for not wearing a mask.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.323]  And don't you love, while they're committing these crimes, they're all wearing, they're masked men.
[00:53:09.343 --> 00:53:10.844]  It's a cult!
[00:53:12.205 --> 00:53:13.706]  Yes, and you know what they said?
[00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:23.653]  The Premier just announced that they're going to penalize you, they're going to take your driver's license away, and they're going to take your insurance registry for your vehicle if you're not wearing a mask.
[00:53:25.194 --> 00:53:27.915]  Oh, now in Europe I know they're saying you can wear one in the car in Germany.
[00:53:27.975 --> 00:53:33.059]  Is that in the car or outside if you don't, it's a social credit score, they're gonna take your car, basically.
[00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.291]  You know, I mean, when is going to be enough?
[00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:39.012]  When, you know, where are you going to rise up, people?
[00:53:39.032 --> 00:53:41.333]  I mean, notice, the masks are never going away.
[00:53:41.393 --> 00:53:45.074]  I told people they're never going to end this until people say no.
[00:53:46.155 --> 00:53:46.535]  That's right.
[00:53:46.815 --> 00:53:53.298]  We'll never say... What we know about bullies, that bullies, they will never stop bullying until you stop the bullying.
[00:53:53.358 --> 00:53:54.998]  And that's what it needs to happen.
[00:53:55.058 --> 00:53:55.599]  Three words.
[00:53:55.859 --> 00:53:56.919]  No, get out.
[00:53:57.299 --> 00:53:58.260]  No, get out.
[00:53:58.991 --> 00:54:04.360]  Well, even the New York Times and Homeland Security saying it's a crisis that Christians won't take the vaccine.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.002]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:54:06.403 --> 00:54:09.628]  It is a Franken-genetic re-engineering program.
[00:54:11.121 --> 00:54:18.704]  That's exactly what it is, and it's killing now more people than the so-called virus did, and it's a total crisis right now.
[00:54:18.904 --> 00:54:26.326]  It's unbelievable, and I receive phone calls from left and right, and the doctors and nurses are calling me, and they said, this is insanity.
[00:54:26.646 --> 00:54:28.507]  This is a genocide.
[00:54:28.547 --> 00:54:31.408]  That's how they're referring to what is happening.
[00:54:31.428 --> 00:54:37.230]  Our email is full of doctors and lawyers and teachers and nurses, and we call them, they send us the evidence.
[00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:42.659]  Where they are giving people shots and people are dropping dead at the vaccination centers.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.064]  And it's not just from the COVID shot.
[00:54:45.424 --> 00:54:47.388]  Suddenly the flu shots are killing a bunch of people.
[00:54:47.649 --> 00:54:48.630]  Something's going on here.
[00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:50.373]  Yes, yes.
[00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.074]  We knew that.
[00:54:51.214 --> 00:54:56.255]  We knew that Gates announced a few years ago that he wants to eliminate six and a half billion people.
[00:54:56.616 --> 00:55:03.218]  Now I got this judge, Gates, that is issuing illegal orders against the Constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[00:55:03.438 --> 00:55:09.020]  We know something is going on and Christians have always been in opposition to genocide and evil.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.921]  So I think that's why they're cracking on us so hard because we're exposing them.
[00:55:13.201 --> 00:55:16.062]  We're bringing the light into darkness and they absolutely hate that.
[00:55:16.343 --> 00:55:17.143]  They hate the truth.
[00:55:18.496 --> 00:55:20.042]  Well, what's the Bible verse, Pastor?
[00:55:20.062 --> 00:55:23.253]  I forget that the gates of hell shall not prevail against Christ's church.
[00:55:24.332 --> 00:55:25.073]  That's exactly.
[00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:38.963]  That's why tomorrow I'm opening the church, tomorrow I'm going to be preaching, and if I am to go down, let the whole world see what is happening in the city of Calgary, in this beautiful country of ours, Canada, and at least let there be thousands of people witness.
[00:55:39.123 --> 00:55:39.404]  That's right.
[00:55:39.424 --> 00:55:41.785]  So you're having Saturday Sabbath services.
[00:55:42.386 --> 00:55:43.507]  Tell us what time and where.
[00:55:43.727 --> 00:55:45.568]  People can go to the website as well.
[00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:48.150]  ArtPulaskiStreetChurch.ca.
[00:55:50.176 --> 00:55:55.118]  9.30 in the morning and the address is 4315 26th Avenue Southeast.
[00:55:55.398 --> 00:55:57.079]  We just changed the building.
[00:55:57.219 --> 00:55:58.100]  It's a bigger building.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.621]  4315 26th Avenue Southeast.
[00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:05.783]  Welcome to come and stand with us in solidarity because that's what we need.
[00:56:06.063 --> 00:56:11.285]  We need to have another solidarity movement in this country and all around the world.
[00:56:11.465 --> 00:56:11.765]  That's right.
[00:56:11.805 --> 00:56:12.906]  The resistance starts now.
[00:56:12.926 --> 00:56:13.786]  They're not going to back off.
[00:56:13.826 --> 00:56:15.947]  We've got to come together peacefully and say no.
[00:56:16.007 --> 00:56:16.547]  God bless you.
[00:56:16.867 --> 00:56:20.148]  Pastor, let us get an update on my Sunday show of what happened, please, sir.
[00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:20.468]  OK?
[00:56:21.329 --> 00:56:21.869]  God bless you.
[00:56:21.889 --> 00:56:22.149]  God bless.
[00:56:22.169 --> 00:56:22.689]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:22.709 --> 00:56:23.049]  Stay with us.
[00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.369]  Thank you.
[00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:25.030]  All right.
[00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.491]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:56:27.031 --> 00:56:35.254]  There's a huge report that's going to be posted in the next 20 minutes to Bandod video that we worked on for a while because there's so many examples of it.
[00:56:35.994 --> 00:56:38.275]  I only wanted a few minutes of it, but it's nine minutes of it.
[00:56:39.472 --> 00:56:41.796]  And it's going to be titled, Proof Joe Biden Has Dementia.
[00:56:44.179 --> 00:56:44.400]  May 2021.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.984]  That's a good way to put her.
[00:56:48.686 --> 00:56:48.987]  Spring 2021.
[00:56:49.107 --> 00:56:51.731]  Does people know this is a new update?
[00:56:53.803 --> 00:56:56.825]  Or just breaking total proof Joe Biden has dementia.
[00:56:57.225 --> 00:56:58.386]  And it's been completely handled.
[00:56:58.986 --> 00:57:00.167]  He has permission for everything.
[00:57:00.247 --> 00:57:01.268]  It's just insane.
[00:57:01.688 --> 00:57:04.390]  And he admits, while he has dementia, that he stole the election.
[00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:06.811]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:57:07.332 --> 00:57:10.254]  So, I have so many guests, I'm not going to have time to air this on the show today.
[00:57:10.774 --> 00:57:11.855]  There's so much you don't see.
[00:57:12.475 --> 00:57:13.696]  That's at band.video.
[00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:20.101]  But the site is exploding thanks to you sharing the links, and that just shows that the fighting spirit of humanity is there.
[00:57:20.641 --> 00:57:27.027]  Share the articles, the videos, from Infowars.com, from band.video, to everyone you know, and tell them to share it.
[00:57:27.387 --> 00:57:35.473]  That causes the chain reaction distribution by proxy that James O'Keefe was in studio with us last week talking about.
[00:57:36.054 --> 00:57:40.757]  Now, I'm going to get more into this with a medical doctor that joins us in Hour 3.
[00:57:43.351 --> 00:57:48.972]  But let me just read to you these headlines, if your radio listener, TV viewers can see this.
[00:57:49.212 --> 00:57:54.653]  Look at this, and then I'm going to play clip four.
[00:57:55.113 --> 00:58:02.014]  And this is the new talking point on the Australian, European, UK, US, Mexico, doesn't matter.
[00:58:03.795 --> 00:58:10.536]  The moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, but then you still got to wear the mask and it doesn't protect you.
[00:58:10.836 --> 00:58:11.756]  It's insane.
[00:58:13.385 --> 00:58:18.587]  That the whole thing was meant to be a bear trap, a tar baby, and I told you that 14 months ago.
[00:58:19.448 --> 00:58:22.249]  I told you Fauci was behind the Wuhan lab 14 months ago.
[00:58:22.489 --> 00:58:24.050]  I told you they'll never take the mask off.
[00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:26.771]  I told you they'll tell you it doesn't protect you from the flu.
[00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:28.572]  Or from the normal cold.
[00:58:28.932 --> 00:58:30.033]  Because it's a plan.
[00:58:32.213 --> 00:58:34.975]  They picked the common cold because you can never fix it.
[00:58:35.095 --> 00:58:39.997]  But now, the majority of people in hospitals sick and dying have been vaccinated.
[00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.137]  And they're having to admit that!
[00:58:41.178 --> 00:58:41.958]  That's why Fauci's like,
[00:58:42.898 --> 00:58:46.001]  Well, you still have to wear the mask forever because there's other variants.
[00:58:46.021 --> 00:58:46.682]  It's not variants.
[00:58:46.762 --> 00:58:47.943]  It doesn't work.
[00:58:48.744 --> 00:58:50.485]  People are dying from being indoors.
[00:58:50.505 --> 00:58:51.546]  They're dying from being unhealthy.
[00:58:51.727 --> 00:58:54.289]  They're dying from not having the proper vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:56.631]  They're dying from depression.
[00:58:56.852 --> 00:59:02.437]  But they're mainly dying from the bizarre, giant genetic engineering experiment.
[00:59:02.837 --> 00:59:04.219]  These are not vaccines.
[00:59:06.374 --> 00:59:08.916]  They are a medical device.
[00:59:08.956 --> 00:59:09.877]  They are a drug.
[00:59:10.257 --> 00:59:11.818]  They are a genetic engineering drug.
[00:59:12.038 --> 00:59:14.280]  They could never get approved for 10 years anywhere in the world.
[00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:18.383]  But the Chinese went ahead with it and approved it, so everybody else got in line.
[00:59:18.963 --> 00:59:20.124]  It's not officially approved.
[00:59:20.324 --> 00:59:21.826]  It's been given emergency authorization.
[00:59:22.585 --> 00:59:40.790]  And now they get everybody to commit the crime to give it, and have the media push it, and the doctors push it, and the nurses push it, and the schools push it, and everybody gets involved, the churches push it, and now everybody's on board for the mass disease and death that's gonna happen, and they predict you'll go under Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:52.881]  Because they'll suppress other voices that tell the truth, and you will now submit to actually allowing everyone, including yourself, to be diseased, crippled, maimed, soft-killed, and finally murdered.
[00:59:54.923 --> 01:00:06.614]  The globalists told you they're going to depopulate you, Wall Street Journal headlines, billionaires meet in secret to discuss world government for depopulation, and they came upon tainted inoculations that kill you slowly.
[01:00:07.739 --> 01:00:14.401]  But if it's strong enough to kill you in five years, and some in a year, some in six months, some are going to die that day, that week.
[01:00:16.062 --> 01:00:19.022]  Because like Gates said, it's going to have to be strong enough.
[01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:23.984]  Some people are going to get really sick right away, because it's meant to kill you down the road.
[01:00:24.004 --> 01:00:27.085]  A snake bite doesn't usually kill you in ten seconds.
[01:00:27.105 --> 01:00:29.986]  It kills you, depending on the type of snake, in a day, a week, a month.
[01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.586]  First, your leg's got to rot off.
[01:00:34.147 --> 01:00:36.728]  So, here is the CNN operative.
[01:00:38.615 --> 01:00:46.723]  The analyst says White House should tell Americans the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, but it's not even a vaccine.
[01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:50.507]  It's a criminal gene therapy that doesn't even work.
[01:00:50.587 --> 01:00:51.608]  I'll play that and then this.
[01:00:52.028 --> 01:00:52.669]  Bombshell!
[01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:55.351]  60% of new COVID patients are
[01:00:56.172 --> 01:00:56.913]  Vaccinated.
[01:00:57.553 --> 01:01:20.468]  Dr. Harvey Reich, very respected Yale medical doctor, on new patients diagnosed with the coronavirus, more than half have been vaccinated, and they're having autoimmune diseases, they're having allergic responses, and the hospitals are being told, call it COVID, and of course they test positive for it, because the PCR test is set up just like Theranos did, to say everybody's got it.
[01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:25.799]  Theranos told millions of people they had cancer that didn't.
[01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:26.719]  They went and had surgeries.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.662]  And the hospitals pay and bring in Theranos because they want to chop your lung out when it's not needed.
[01:01:32.103 --> 01:01:34.304]  It's total criminal greed.
[01:01:35.084 --> 01:01:35.765]  Because why not?
[01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:37.326]  You deserve to be depopulated anyways.
[01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:39.647]  See how it works?
[01:01:40.027 --> 01:01:41.969]  See how it's only certain hospitals that have all the deaths?
[01:01:42.249 --> 01:01:45.071]  Because most hospitals aren't converted over to the pure evil yet.
[01:01:45.751 --> 01:01:47.912]  This is a scientific takeover plan.
[01:01:48.212 --> 01:01:48.693]  Here she is.
[01:01:49.667 --> 01:01:58.269]  ...to you about this yesterday, about, you know, why not more clear delineation of what can change now for those who are already vaccinated.
[01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:12.514]  His answer was that, you know, community spread is still too high in the view of the CDC in some places, but he does believe that as we see that graph continue to come down, that there are going to be more relaxations coming soon.
[01:02:12.554 --> 01:02:17.015]  He mentioned in workplaces, he mentioned for travel, and I wonder how significant you think that is.
[01:02:19.366 --> 01:02:20.467]  I definitely think it matters.
[01:02:20.647 --> 01:02:26.894]  I think, though, that the approach that Dr. Fauci and President Biden have been taking is a societal approach.
[01:02:27.194 --> 01:02:30.918]  They're saying there is the light at the end of the tunnel for all of us together.
[01:02:31.238 --> 01:02:40.227]  And when we can reduce the level of infection in the community, increase vaccination rates, that's when, at some point, hopefully soon, but at some point, we can relax the restrictions.
[01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:42.669]  I don't know if that works for many Americans.
[01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:45.411]  For many people, it probably does work to say, yes, we're in this together.
[01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:46.352]  It's patriotic.
[01:02:46.392 --> 01:02:47.292]  We're doing this together.
[01:02:47.813 --> 01:02:51.455]  But I think a lot of people are thinking kind of selfishly, thinking, what's in it for me?
[01:02:51.975 --> 01:02:54.817]  And they're not willing to wait until this elusive herd immunity.
[01:02:55.257 --> 01:03:05.424]  If we can tell those individuals who otherwise would not get vaccinated, if we say to them, the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two week mark.
[01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.826]  These are people who otherwise might not be vaccinated.
[01:03:07.926 --> 01:03:09.327]  So let's give them that incentive.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.921]  And that's what they're all saying across the world.
[01:03:12.102 --> 01:03:13.002]  That was always the plan.
[01:03:13.403 --> 01:03:14.563]  And it's going to be forced, folks.
[01:03:14.643 --> 01:03:23.750]  Once they get a majority to do it, they're gonna say, oh, things would open, but you wouldn't do it, so there's still COVID-19, which they set a computer to claim everybody has.
[01:03:25.532 --> 01:03:35.599]  And then when you die, the other viruses and things they're actually releasing, or people are dying from the vaccines, they're not just gonna die six months from now, or two years from now, like the ferrets died in a couple months.
[01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:39.082]  That's, for humans, a couple years out, because ferrets don't live as long.
[01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:41.531]  Well, they do animal studies.
[01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.292]  They'll die quicker, but it's usually the same.
[01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:48.395]  So, you know, if a dog dies in a week, humans will probably die in six months.
[01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:53.298]  If a ferret dies in a month, humans will die in a year.
[01:03:53.318 --> 01:03:55.519]  That's how it works.
[01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:58.901]  If a rat dies in a week, a human dies in six months, a year.
[01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:02.083]  They know what they're doing.
[01:04:02.603 --> 01:04:03.704]  They know what they're doing.
[01:04:04.724 --> 01:04:08.826]  And there's a name for, you can have your freedom back once you do what I say.
[01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.126]  It's called being held hostage.
[01:04:10.166 --> 01:04:11.326]  It's called terrorism.
[01:04:11.527 --> 01:04:13.427]  It's called the definition of being a prisoner.
[01:04:14.148 --> 01:04:17.329]  But it's okay because all the corporate spokespersons for this are women.
[01:04:17.869 --> 01:04:19.950]  That's why all the Hollywood movies, the women are the boss.
[01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:21.930]  All the Hollywood movies, the hero are women.
[01:04:22.171 --> 01:04:22.991]  Nothing to do with women.
[01:04:23.191 --> 01:04:25.552]  And so you get used to seeing women as the authority.
[01:04:26.232 --> 01:04:29.113]  So the system goes out and hires women so they look non-threatening.
[01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:33.414]  Or they put men in a wig and dress up like a clown and go, I'm here for your children.
[01:04:33.714 --> 01:04:35.894]  I'm a convicted pedophile, but I'm not a man.
[01:04:36.194 --> 01:04:38.055]  I'm a lady with a heart on!
[01:04:38.915 --> 01:04:41.695]  See, it's all just, oh, look, it's pink sweater Bill Gates.
[01:04:41.995 --> 01:04:43.336]  Oh, it's a drag queen.
[01:04:43.616 --> 01:04:47.637]  Oh, it's a Chinese lady.
[01:04:47.857 --> 01:04:49.457]  Those guys in uniforms, we'd fight back.
[01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:53.378]  We're being taught to fight the police, you see, because this is a new type of war.
[01:04:54.605 --> 01:05:02.134]  We sail through deep space, our blue jewel orbiting that beautiful yellow star.
[01:05:03.476 --> 01:05:05.899]  Well, we're having him on a lot because he's doing a lot.
[01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:07.561]  He's representing folks that
[01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:13.976]  And I also want to get his take on the announcements that have been made within one week of Biden being in office in January of this year.
[01:05:13.996 --> 01:05:15.537]  Now, four months ago, three and a half months ago.
[01:05:35.475 --> 01:05:42.538]  That they're going to use the CIA and intelligence agencies to disrupt the Trump networks that attack the Capitol.
[01:05:42.558 --> 01:05:50.300]  So if you went, the million people there at Trump's speech, and you were a couple hundred thousand went down to the Capitol because he was going to speak there, and a few hundred broke in while you're all terrorists.
[01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:55.943]  And he said that in the State of the Union, which he now calls a joint session or joint address.
[01:05:57.463 --> 01:06:02.185]  He said, if you are a terrorist and being a white supremacist is a terrorist, we're going to arrest you.
[01:06:03.203 --> 01:06:06.166]  Well, now they can define anybody as a white supremacist and arrest you.
[01:06:06.746 --> 01:06:08.528]  And he said, you know, you have a right to free speech.
[01:06:08.568 --> 01:06:09.509]  That's yelling fire in a theater.
[01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:11.070]  Well, the theater's on fire.
[01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.091]  I better yell fire in it.
[01:06:12.831 --> 01:06:19.157]  And of course, that's the decision that they used in World War I to arrest people that were against the draft.
[01:06:19.878 --> 01:06:23.081]  So this is very, very, very dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:23.421 --> 01:06:25.423]  And he's to head up the Judiciary Committee.
[01:06:25.943 --> 01:06:28.926]  He knows all this and he's actually quoted the World War I.
[01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.092]  Uh, case that was used to start rounding up thousands of people.
[01:06:33.152 --> 01:06:34.773]  So, they mean bidness.
[01:06:35.794 --> 01:06:37.615]  This just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:39.036]  I told you this was coming yesterday.
[01:06:39.056 --> 01:06:40.157]  Nobody else was talking about it.
[01:06:40.177 --> 01:06:40.797]  I wish everybody was.
[01:06:41.037 --> 01:06:42.859]  Tucker Carlson got it and covered it last night.
[01:06:43.439 --> 01:06:44.680]  He said, they're coming after you.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.561]  They've told you.
[01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:47.001]  Being white inherently is bad.
[01:06:47.762 --> 01:06:51.745]  DOJ actively considering domestic terrorism law to target white supremacists.
[01:06:53.131 --> 01:06:56.653]  That's why they tell you Antifa doesn't exist, but white supremacism is just an epidemic.
[01:06:57.133 --> 01:06:58.373]  That's why everybody's a white supremacist.
[01:06:59.134 --> 01:07:04.096]  On Wednesday night, President Joe Biden told Congress that white supremacy is terrorism, after claiming the U.S.
[01:07:04.136 --> 01:07:08.918]  intelligence considers it's the most lethal terrorism threat to our homeland today.
[01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:09.458]  That's a quote.
[01:07:10.138 --> 01:07:22.364]  Hours earlier, House Intelligence Committee Representative Adam Schiff and the rest of the Chinese spies on his committee, like Swallowswell, the sinner, were on the stage for the narrative by telling MSNBC's Noel Wallace that the
[01:07:23.732 --> 01:07:27.154]  Predominant part of the domestic threat is white nationalists.
[01:07:27.714 --> 01:07:28.995]  Ah, we know we're not globalists.
[01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:34.978]  We can't ignore that because of a politically sensitivity that some of the folks are part of the Trump base.
[01:07:35.278 --> 01:07:40.501]  And they go on to say the FBI, the CIA, the intelligence agencies are going to disrupt us.
[01:07:41.301 --> 01:07:43.042]  That's when you send the Green Berets in to kill people.
[01:07:43.682 --> 01:07:44.243]  That's what that means.
[01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:48.384]  So, it's all here, it's all being announced, it's all being done.
[01:07:48.824 --> 01:07:50.485]  It is the twilight of our republic.
[01:07:50.605 --> 01:07:53.305]  It is a dictatorship being set up.
[01:07:53.325 --> 01:07:58.307]  So let's tackle that first, Norm Pattis, and then we'll get into the so-called inoculations.
[01:07:58.327 --> 01:08:06.629]  It's just one thing to say, conscientious objection, medical exemption, because a lot of people can't take vaccines, or religious exemptions against my religion, you know, like Orthodox Jews.
[01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:08.650]  It's in Leviticus, do not mix your seed.
[01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:14.834]  You know, don't have a man, you know, have sex with your wife, whatever.
[01:08:15.115 --> 01:08:15.735]  It's all there.
[01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:17.216]  They're saying, oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:17.577 --> 01:08:25.663]  We are now the state coming in and annihilating your First Amendment, though it says Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:08:25.963 --> 01:08:28.085]  So every Rubicon's being marched over.
[01:08:28.665 --> 01:08:30.026]  Everything is being imploded.
[01:08:30.987 --> 01:08:37.092]  And just as a constitutional lawyer, one of the top ones in the country, and a criminal lawyer, what the hell do you make of all of this?
[01:08:40.234 --> 01:08:41.375]  I've said it before on your show.
[01:08:41.415 --> 01:08:42.135]  I've said it elsewhere.
[01:08:42.495 --> 01:08:44.376]  The Constitution is not chiseled and granted.
[01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:46.017]  It's really a silly putty doctrine.
[01:08:46.097 --> 01:08:49.178]  It can be stretched by those in power to cover a multitude of sins.
[01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:55.502]  And right now it's being stretched in ways that make the country unrecognizable to me and uninhabitable, I suspect, to many.
[01:08:55.922 --> 01:09:00.124]  So your discussion of white supremacism was, I thought, directly on point.
[01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:06.626]  You know, I've been accused by others of being a racist because I don't believe, for example, in providing reparations to people of color.
[01:09:07.327 --> 01:09:10.128]  Because I don't think that there should be reverse discrimination.
[01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:13.549]  You don't believe that we should teach elementary school students they're bad because they're white?
[01:09:14.406 --> 01:09:15.006]  No, absolutely not.
[01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:16.607]  I think that's an outrageous suggestion.
[01:09:16.627 --> 01:09:20.368]  If I had kids in school, I'd pull them from school or start suing school administrators.
[01:09:20.748 --> 01:09:22.809]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, people are people.
[01:09:22.869 --> 01:09:25.070]  All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.771]  Red, black, white, or brown.
[01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:31.212]  And when we demonize one class of people, we do so to valorize the others.
[01:09:31.532 --> 01:09:36.054]  And I'm not going to sit back and live in a country in which I become suspect because of the color of my skin.
[01:09:36.594 --> 01:09:51.296]  Now, as I was listening to you talk about Biden, I thought of the counterintelligence pro or COINTELPRO operations in the 1960s and 70s, where it was discovered that the FBI and other intelligence agencies had infiltrated civil rights movement and infiltrated the left.
[01:09:51.841 --> 01:09:52.401]  We're good to go.
[01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:10.713]  Well, no.
[01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:12.375]  Well, that's because you're a racist.
[01:10:12.415 --> 01:10:17.159]  Well, yeah, this is a classic Marxist ideology, a rearguard action with a globalist taking the country over.
[01:10:17.539 --> 01:10:18.440]  What needs to be done?
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.443]  We need to strip the funding of universities and schools that do this.
[01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:24.185]  We need laws passed that block it, as some states are doing.
[01:10:24.205 --> 01:10:26.347]  I mean, but this is, this is so poisonous.
[01:10:26.367 --> 01:10:33.934]  I mean, what about anti-terrorism laws that waive the Constitution for, quote, Al Qaeda, now to be used against Trump supporters?
[01:10:34.254 --> 01:10:35.235]  I mean, this is next level.
[01:10:36.472 --> 01:10:44.880]  It is, and you know, I mean, as a litigator, I mean, all I can say is that, you know, the courts are still open and you can continue to raise these claims in court, and you ought to raise these claims in court.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.344]  Point to areas where the law has been stretched to the breaking point and say to a judge, do you really mean this?
[01:10:49.484 --> 01:10:52.507]  Because what you're saying is absolutely gibberish and it makes no sense.
[01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:57.372]  And remember, they tried to expel Ted Cruz, saying he orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[01:10:57.552 --> 01:10:58.573]  That's preposterous!
[01:10:59.614 --> 01:11:00.895]  They want total power.
[01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:05.431]  The attack on the Capitol is one of the most overrated events in American history.
[01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:06.832]  Yes, it was disturbing.
[01:11:07.172 --> 01:11:09.634]  Some folks turned to violence and things got out of hand.
[01:11:09.714 --> 01:11:12.335]  But the votes were counted the very day they were supposed to be counted.
[01:11:12.596 --> 01:11:13.696]  The Electoral College votes.
[01:11:13.716 --> 01:11:15.918]  And there were arrests and there will be some convictions.
[01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:23.883]  But to suggest, as Biden did in his speech the other night, that this was the most dangerous moment in American history in several centuries is ridiculous.
[01:11:24.283 --> 01:11:25.844]  People aren't watching the signs.
[01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:29.046]  You know, John Locke talked about government as a creation of consent.
[01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:29.786]  Well, exactly.
[01:11:29.806 --> 01:11:30.647]  Declaration of Independence.
[01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:32.568]  I mean, if the Feds order gun confiscation and start a civil war,
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:12:01.542]  It's people's right and duty to organize and defend themselves, and so it'll be about who has the better military force at that point, and then they'll write the history books.
[01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:03.543]  I think the left has already made that decision.
[01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.043]  They're involved in an offensive war.
[01:12:05.323 --> 01:12:07.024]  To start a civil war, they believe, will win.
[01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.104]  Let's shift gears.
[01:12:09.004 --> 01:12:13.426]  Calling this an inoculation, I believe, is the wrong way to go, but I understand you have to go through the law on that.
[01:12:13.986 --> 01:12:16.087]  But explain the lawsuits that are going on.
[01:12:16.107 --> 01:12:20.308]  This is really, to me, about an experimental drug or gene therapy, a frankenshot,
[01:12:21.068 --> 01:12:24.950]  Uh, that they are trying to deploy against the public in a hysterical stampede.
[01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:27.372]  Uh, but at least you are fighting back.
[01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:29.653]  You filed a lawsuit, uh, there in Connecticut.
[01:12:29.673 --> 01:12:35.816]  It's got international, national news, uh, where you guys are saying, no, the religious exemption should stand.
[01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:36.617]  Tell us about that.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.188]  Thomas Jefferson said the fundamental and most inalienable right of all was the freedom of religion, the freedom to worship as you please.
[01:12:44.589 --> 01:12:49.575]  You know, we find ourselves in a universe we didn't create and we make our peace with it on the best possible terms that we can.
[01:12:49.935 --> 01:12:53.420]  That means we educate our children, we educate ourselves in which select values.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:01.826]  Religious values have been regarded as fundamental in this country, and one of the reasons that we have government is to protect the people's rights to express those values.
[01:13:02.266 --> 01:13:11.974]  Connecticut, with five other states recently, took a direct shot at religious freedom by saying to parents that you no longer have the ability to say no to vaccinations.
[01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:19.720]  If you say no to vaccinations, you cannot educate your children in a public school or a parochial school in Connecticut.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:30.429]  And the result is, many parents have lost the ability to say, look, I don't want a vaccination that was developed in part using cells derived from aborted fetuses.
[01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.672]  I don't want that vaccination in my child's body.
[01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:39.757]  Well, that's like a woman saying, I don't want a man to tackle me in a parking lot and rape me and put semen into my vagina.
[01:13:39.977 --> 01:13:44.041]  Except this is Bill Gates's concoction with dead baby parts they want to rape us with.
[01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:44.782]  It's outrageous!
[01:13:46.091 --> 01:13:49.032]  It is, and plenty of parents are hopping mad about it in Connecticut.
[01:13:49.052 --> 01:13:50.233]  So we filed a suit.
[01:13:50.253 --> 01:13:51.613]  We're intending to get it filed today.
[01:13:51.653 --> 01:13:52.773]  We wanted to get it filed yesterday.
[01:13:52.813 --> 01:13:53.554]  There were some wrinkles.
[01:13:53.574 --> 01:13:54.234]  There always are.
[01:13:54.594 --> 01:14:02.297]  But we intend to have the suit in the court today, basically saying you're abridging the First Amendment right of parents to express their religious beliefs.
[01:14:02.597 --> 01:14:05.558]  You're depriving them of public benefits on account of their religious beliefs.
[01:14:05.898 --> 01:14:11.020]  And what's more, you are discriminating against people who have religious beliefs.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:14.221]  It's an outrageous power grab, and it's rape.
[01:14:14.821 --> 01:14:16.962]  And again, under the statute, they're calling it a vaccine.
[01:14:17.282 --> 01:14:23.664]  They're shoehorning in genetic modification that was never approved anywhere under vaccines now for liability protection.
[01:14:24.624 --> 01:14:26.224]  Welcome back, final segment of this hour.
[01:14:26.284 --> 01:14:27.285]  Norm Pattis is here with us.
[01:14:27.305 --> 01:14:30.866]  He's a very smart criminal lawyer, one of the top criminal lawyers in the country.
[01:14:30.886 --> 01:14:33.426]  He's one of the top constitutional lawyers, First Amendment lawyers.
[01:14:33.646 --> 01:14:34.107]  He's up there.
[01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:35.447]  That's documented.
[01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:40.989]  But I'm going to get him on the horn with Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:42.129]  Biological Weapons Law.
[01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:50.703]  And who also was a top UN war crimes prosecutor and helped write the World Treaty on Bioweapons and Chemical Weapons.
[01:14:51.123 --> 01:15:05.755]  He came on in February, March, and April of last year and laid out everything about Wuhan, Fauci, what the virus really is, gain of function, and how the vaccine would actually be what would start killing people.
[01:15:06.943 --> 01:15:08.204]  Well, now it's all come out.
[01:15:08.985 --> 01:15:13.608]  And he knows how to, he's the guy that got him to stop the anthrax shots twice in the U.S.
[01:15:13.628 --> 01:15:15.610]  military that killed over 20,000 people.
[01:15:17.391 --> 01:15:17.692]  Okay?
[01:15:18.372 --> 01:15:26.419]  And he knows how to go at them, not from the fact that it's a vaccine, but that it's actually a gene therapy illegal drug that they are putting in under
[01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:34.910]  Putting in under the 1986 Liability Protection Act that Reagan, well I liked Reagan but that was a bad thing Reagan let happen, to give the vaccine makers.
[01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:37.231]  So back then there was like six or seven vaccines they wanted you to have.
[01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:39.092]  Now it's 50 plus because they have protection.
[01:15:39.352 --> 01:15:41.573]  And now they can mandate it and make you take it basically.
[01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:43.894]  Well now, oh how do we get gene therapy?
[01:15:43.934 --> 01:15:47.536]  We can't ever get legalized that kills so many animals in trials.
[01:15:47.816 --> 01:15:50.798]  We'll just put it in the general public and call it a vaccine.
[01:15:50.938 --> 01:15:52.418]  This is incredible.
[01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:55.040]  The biggest power grab ever by Big Pharma.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.284]  And you've got Fauci creating policy, you've got Fauci at the NIH, Fauci running the Wuhan lab, it's all coming out.
[01:16:01.705 --> 01:16:11.813]  So I think if we get, because Boyle was on like two months ago, and he's like, they're coming with the vaccines, this is how you refuse, and this is the document you can post to InfoWars, and here's my phone number, people want to just randomly call me.
[01:16:11.973 --> 01:16:12.773]  He's a big professor.
[01:16:13.534 --> 01:16:16.096]  He's got the Harvard PhD that only one guy gets a year.
[01:16:16.456 --> 01:16:17.337]  Kissinger trained him.
[01:16:18.903 --> 01:16:22.768]  I've got to get him, with Norm passing, to their lawyers so that we can go with this.
[01:16:23.128 --> 01:16:27.073]  It's great to file and say religious exemption, First Amendment, Trump's your BS.
[01:16:27.173 --> 01:16:27.934]  Totally reasonable.
[01:16:28.234 --> 01:16:30.016]  I believe that Norm's right to sue on that.
[01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:37.525]  But we need other suits because this is new what's happening of them shoehorning genetic engineering, totally different system, in
[01:16:38.206 --> 01:16:42.147]  I mean, if I injected you with cyanide and called it a vaccine, would I get liability protection?
[01:16:42.407 --> 01:16:44.828]  If I injected you with, I mean, this is a mutagenic system.
[01:16:45.128 --> 01:16:46.988]  So I didn't get you on to preach at you, Norm.
[01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:48.609]  I'm just really pissed about this.
[01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:49.609]  You're taking action.
[01:16:49.649 --> 01:16:50.489]  You're a man of action.
[01:16:50.769 --> 01:16:54.010]  We salute you, but I got to get you with Dr. Boyle, who's on with us tomorrow.
[01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:55.291]  We're going to tape to air.
[01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:56.591]  It'll air at four o'clock tomorrow.
[01:16:56.891 --> 01:16:57.571]  I'm going to send it to you.
[01:16:57.591 --> 01:17:00.812]  I'm going to get you his number because I think you guys teaming up is going to be huge.
[01:17:00.832 --> 01:17:03.733]  I'm going to stop ranting, but give me your take on what I just said.
[01:17:05.572 --> 01:17:08.214]  I don't know enough about it to have an intelligent take.
[01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:18.583]  What you're telling me is that significant portions of what has been sold in the name of public health is actually a pretext for something else and has implicit dangers that we're not being warned about.
[01:17:19.084 --> 01:17:22.567]  If that is in fact true, that's an outrageous violation of trust.
[01:17:22.967 --> 01:17:32.115]  Look, we have laws in the United States that says a person is free to refuse medical treatment in order to accept it.
[01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:33.957]  They must give informed consent.
[01:17:34.357 --> 01:17:35.719]  Now, I took the vaccine.
[01:17:35.759 --> 01:17:37.581]  I got double shots of Pfizer.
[01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:41.485]  Nobody warned me about any gene therapy or anything like that.
[01:17:41.605 --> 01:17:49.052]  So, as far as I knew, I was taking a vaccine that was tested under exigent circumstances to meet an emergency.
[01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:51.275]  I think I'm all right.
[01:17:52.456 --> 01:17:53.317]  Maybe I'll be here tomorrow.
[01:17:53.357 --> 01:17:53.938]  Maybe I won't.
[01:17:53.998 --> 01:17:55.039]  But what you're telling me is
[01:17:55.579 --> 01:17:59.881]  It's basically pay better attention to what's going on and I'm ashamed to say I haven't.
[01:18:00.461 --> 01:18:01.962]  Let's be clear, you're a marathon runner.
[01:18:02.002 --> 01:18:03.322]  I saw you eating a salad during the break.
[01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:05.803]  You're a healthy guy and it varies with people.
[01:18:05.843 --> 01:18:10.565]  But yes, it manipulates the ribosomes and then programs your cell, does all sorts of things.
[01:18:10.805 --> 01:18:12.006]  It's extremely dangerous.
[01:18:12.406 --> 01:18:14.027]  So are the other ones.
[01:18:14.067 --> 01:18:18.429]  So are the virus vector vaccines of JJ and AstraZeneca.
[01:18:18.449 --> 01:18:18.869]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:18:19.912 --> 01:18:21.053]  No, I cut you off.
[01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:21.614]  I apologize.
[01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:22.755]  I want to know more, Alex.
[01:18:22.815 --> 01:18:25.297]  I mean, I was stunned in researching why...
[01:18:26.776 --> 01:18:33.738]  Our clients wanted to file a lawsuit regarding the elimination of the religious exemption for vaccines.
[01:18:34.118 --> 01:18:41.140]  I was stunned to learn about the role of replicated fetal tissue from aborted fetuses in developing the vaccine.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.542]  My clients regard abortion as murder, as the intentional taking of another human life.
[01:18:46.882 --> 01:18:51.783]  And their position is, look, as part of my religious convictions, I don't want to be putting things into my
[01:18:51.803 --> 01:18:54.689]  Well, not to mention the huge history of secret testing, all of this.
[01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:58.316]  I mean, this is, I mean, think about Tuskegee experiment.
[01:19:04.636 --> 01:19:04.856]  Yeah.
[01:19:05.397 --> 01:19:07.598]  Well, that was a chilling example.
[01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:16.244]  For decades, men were injected with syphilis and then not treated and followed to see what the natural course of syphilis would look like as it ran through the human body.
[01:19:16.364 --> 01:19:17.545]  And that was done to black folks.
[01:19:17.765 --> 01:19:18.766]  That was done to black folks.
[01:19:19.346 --> 01:19:21.488]  Let me play a clip of CNN spokeswoman.
[01:19:22.268 --> 01:19:24.611]  Uh, saying that you only get your freedom once you take your shot.
[01:19:24.631 --> 01:19:25.632]  Sounds like being held hostage.
[01:19:25.672 --> 01:19:26.053]  Here it is.
[01:19:26.473 --> 01:19:35.263]  When we can reduce the level of infection in the community, increase vaccination rates, that's when, at some point, hopefully soon, but at some point, we can relax the restrictions.
[01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.005]  I don't know if that works for
[01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:40.448]  For many Americans, for many people, it probably does work to say, yes, we're in this together.
[01:19:40.548 --> 01:19:41.368]  It's patriotic.
[01:19:41.408 --> 01:19:42.329]  We're doing this together.
[01:19:42.829 --> 01:19:46.472]  But I think a lot of people are thinking kind of selfishly, thinking what's in it for me.
[01:19:46.992 --> 01:19:49.834]  And they're not willing to wait until this elusive herd immunity.
[01:19:50.295 --> 01:20:00.442]  If we can tell those individuals who otherwise would not get vaccinated, if we say to them, the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two week mark.
[01:20:00.842 --> 01:20:02.844]  These are people who otherwise might not be vaccinated.
[01:20:02.944 --> 01:20:04.325]  So let's give them that incentive.
[01:20:04.565 --> 01:20:05.806]  Oh, oh, oh, being held hostage.
[01:20:05.826 --> 01:20:10.789]  So first it's 15 days to cut the curve, then it's just two months of masks, then it's just a year, now it's two years.
[01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:13.991]  Now CNN says permanently mask, permanently over.
[01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:19.415]  Klaus Schwab at Davos said you will never have jobs where people are in close proximity again.
[01:20:19.435 --> 01:20:25.279]  So this is a cult of death period, ladies and gentlemen, from a Planned Parenthood lady.
[01:20:25.859 --> 01:20:28.320]  This is all eugenics, it's all depopulation.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:28.781]  Norm Pattis?
[01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:40.050]  Absolutely terrifying to hear a person under cloak of public authority say that you can earn your freedom, but first you must submit your body to my custody, my dominion, and my control.
[01:20:41.696 --> 01:20:43.918]  We have limited government in this country for a reason.
[01:20:44.018 --> 01:20:46.179]  You know, science, let's be real about what science is.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.841]  Science is instrumental reason.
[01:20:47.921 --> 01:20:53.805]  If you want to make something, you want to do something, you turn to science and technology to learn how to make it or do it and do it better.
[01:20:54.125 --> 01:21:01.291]  But science does not, you can say you love science, that you love gadgets, that you love wizardry, but you don't love wisdom if you love science.
[01:21:01.391 --> 01:21:06.653]  Well, and we don't love the men and the dictators in Xi Jinping that run it that say, submit to science.
[01:21:06.913 --> 01:21:10.114]  People said, hey, we don't want babies being used for genetic engineering.
[01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:12.474]  And Psaki said, it's science.
[01:21:13.214 --> 01:21:18.196]  Well, hey, if somebody walks up to her and shoots her in the head and blows her head off, it's science of how a gun works.
[01:21:18.436 --> 01:21:19.316]  I don't want her to get killed.
[01:21:19.516 --> 01:21:19.976]  Is it OK?
[01:21:20.056 --> 01:21:20.777]  Because it's science?
[01:21:21.017 --> 01:21:21.557]  No, it's not.
[01:21:23.187 --> 01:21:24.849]  Science doesn't set the ends of life.
[01:21:24.949 --> 01:21:27.112]  Our faith and our beliefs and our ideals do.
[01:21:27.452 --> 01:21:32.898]  And we've never been in this country in a situation where we yielded to government the right to tell us how to live.
[01:21:33.239 --> 01:21:36.082]  We have limited government to make possible our lives together.
[01:21:36.442 --> 01:21:40.307]  Now, can we have a meaningful and reasonable debate about public health in the United States?
[01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:41.188]  Absolutely.
[01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.009]  But you've got to be honest with me.
[01:21:43.249 --> 01:21:44.389]  You've got to be transparent.
[01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:48.191]  You've got to tell me what it is you propose to do to me and what the risks are.
[01:21:56.545 --> 01:21:57.045]  Experimental.
[01:21:57.065 --> 01:22:00.088]  You have to go beyond that and show them everything, the actual insert.
[01:22:00.428 --> 01:22:01.369]  It has to all be read.
[01:22:01.389 --> 01:22:02.550]  It has to be signed off on.
[01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:04.091]  If it's experimental.
[01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:05.972]  That's why they can't make the military even take it.
[01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:09.335]  Because it's experimental and the law is you can't do that.
[01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:10.296]  Norman, 60 seconds.
[01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:12.277]  Great job with the lawsuit.
[01:22:12.577 --> 01:22:13.478]  What's the process?
[01:22:13.838 --> 01:22:17.461]  How long is this going to take as they try to forcibly inoculate everybody in Connecticut?
[01:22:17.601 --> 01:22:19.603]  Because as Connecticut goes, so goes the rest of the nation.
[01:22:20.609 --> 01:22:22.490]  We'll file hopefully this afternoon.
[01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:25.651]  I thought we were going to be in yesterday in federal court and then there'll be motions.
[01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.471]  I'm sure the state will file a motion to dismiss.
[01:22:27.531 --> 01:22:28.291]  They'll be briefing.
[01:22:28.852 --> 01:22:32.853]  There'll probably be a judicial decision on the preliminary merits of the suit within four months.
[01:22:33.653 --> 01:22:38.435]  We will follow up next week with a suit in state court raising state constitutional claims.
[01:22:38.515 --> 01:22:40.335]  That process will take four to six months.
[01:22:40.676 --> 01:22:41.976]  So keep an eye on Connecticut.
[01:22:42.696 --> 01:22:48.321]  We intend to frame the federal issue in such a way as to get it before the United States Supreme Court if we can.
[01:22:48.621 --> 01:22:50.823]  We think the right to religious freedom is fundamental.
[01:22:51.083 --> 01:22:52.765]  We think limited government is fundamental.
[01:22:52.965 --> 01:22:54.446]  They're on a collision course right now.
[01:22:54.706 --> 01:22:58.589]  And in the name of religious belief and individual freedom, we mean to trim the sails of government.
[01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.950]  All right.
[01:22:58.970 --> 01:23:00.391]  Pattisblog.com to your own show.
[01:23:00.451 --> 01:23:00.891]  We love you.
[01:23:01.171 --> 01:23:01.532]  Take care.
[01:23:01.952 --> 01:23:02.232]  Okay.
[01:23:02.392 --> 01:23:03.874]  I've got a medical doctor coming on.
[01:23:04.654 --> 01:23:06.836]  Uh, who's been exposing this stuff for almost a year.
[01:23:06.856 --> 01:23:08.317]  She's been on with us once before.
[01:23:08.377 --> 01:23:10.119]  We'll tell you about her when she joins us.
[01:23:10.179 --> 01:23:13.062]  And I got this huge stack of incredible information.
[01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:14.323]  I mean, wow.
[01:23:14.363 --> 01:23:17.505]  The majority of people in the hospital with COVID had the COVID shot.
[01:23:17.806 --> 01:23:19.087]  They're sick from the COVID shot.
[01:23:19.547 --> 01:23:20.448]  That's top doctors.
[01:23:20.488 --> 01:23:22.210]  This is all coming out.
[01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.950]  It is insane.
[01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.551]  Separately,
[01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:29.553]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are the ones that keep us on air, like gravity keeps us on the ground.
[01:23:29.953 --> 01:23:31.194]  When you buy products, we stay on air.
[01:23:31.234 --> 01:23:33.935]  When you don't, we are screwed, blued, and tattooed.
[01:23:33.955 --> 01:23:36.236]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[01:23:36.616 --> 01:23:41.939]  I'm running the sale on Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula until Tuesday morning, because we've got a limited supply.
[01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:43.260]  It's the highest-level curcuminoid, 95%.

[01:23:52.224 --> 01:23:52.864]  People love it.
[01:23:53.124 --> 01:23:54.204]  They get great results.
[01:23:54.284 --> 01:23:58.206]  It has 4.9 stars, 97% reviews.
[01:23:59.506 --> 01:24:00.407]  It is back in stock.
[01:24:00.727 --> 01:24:02.707]  It's going to go back to regular price on Tuesday.
[01:24:03.048 --> 01:24:05.228]  Infowarstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:06.589]  Basso Beach, so good for your heart, your liver.
[01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:14.084]  The concentrated beets, that has all these trace elements and things.
[01:24:14.124 --> 01:24:17.886]  I'm not even sure why it does it, but it creates nitrous oxide in the blood that's so good for the body.
[01:24:19.286 --> 01:24:21.307]  That's infowarestore.com.
[01:24:21.427 --> 01:24:23.888]  It's 50% off as well.
[01:24:23.908 --> 01:24:26.849]  I'll be able to extend the sale on that a week, but the body's ends.
[01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:29.870]  We also have Winter Sun, still discounted, about to sell out.
[01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:32.511]  Really close to selling out, but more is coming in soon.
[01:24:33.071 --> 01:24:36.092]  The Vitamin Mineral Fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals you need, and the amino acids.
[01:24:36.452 --> 01:24:38.613]  All the essentials, great for adults, children,
[01:24:40.457 --> 01:24:41.899]  Old, young, everybody needs it.
[01:24:41.999 --> 01:24:43.582]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:24:43.602 --> 01:24:44.963]  That discount's going to have to end very soon.
[01:24:44.983 --> 01:24:46.285]  It's going to be sold out, period.
[01:24:46.365 --> 01:24:48.248]  It's all at Infowarstore.com.
[01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:53.715]  And we've got all the great t-shirts, In Game to Film, being sold as low as $3.95 and so much more.
[01:24:53.975 --> 01:24:54.976]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:56.438]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:24:57.299 --> 01:25:06.811]  Dr. Carrie Madej, who I think joined us eight months ago, nine months ago or so, she's one of the first big prominent doctors to come out and really warn about the mRNA and point out that it's not a vaccine.
[01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:08.793]  She came on, had a lot of courage.
[01:25:09.294 --> 01:25:11.076]  Boy, has she been vindicated.
[01:25:11.116 --> 01:25:12.457]  She'll be joining us coming up.
[01:25:13.303 --> 01:25:28.894]  At the start of the next segment, and I'm going to go over all of this crazy, crazy, crazy news with her, but also talk to her about the stories she's heard, the reports she'd seen, what other doctors and nurses are telling her.
[01:25:28.974 --> 01:25:30.054]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:25:30.354 --> 01:25:40.021]  And now you've got Wolfgang Wardog, one of the top scientists, advisory boards, the EU coming out with emergency papers in December saying this is a genocide, basically.
[01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:42.683]  You've got the former chief scientist at Pfizer saying that's
[01:25:44.158 --> 01:25:45.278]  This is twilight zone.
[01:25:45.378 --> 01:25:47.739]  I mean, this is twilight zone.
[01:25:48.119 --> 01:25:50.080]  Are there some bad responses to other vaccines?
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.140]  Are there autoimmune issues?
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.501]  Are they tainted sometimes?
[01:25:52.521 --> 01:25:52.861]  Yeah.
[01:25:53.221 --> 01:25:54.241]  Is there liability protection?
[01:25:54.281 --> 01:25:54.862]  Is that a problem?
[01:25:54.882 --> 01:25:55.122]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.602 --> 01:26:01.624]  But all the old problems of vaccines are nothing compared to this frankenshot, which aren't vaccines.
[01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:06.565]  So I refuse to call them vaccines, but to educate the public, they say, you know that thing they're injecting in you?
[01:26:07.446 --> 01:26:07.946]  Well, would
[01:26:09.025 --> 01:26:12.867]  Would cyanide, if you injected it, would you, they call it a vaccine, would you take it?
[01:26:12.887 --> 01:26:14.128]  Because cyanide will kill you.
[01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:23.954]  Something injected, they're now saying it's liability protection under the 1986 vaccine damage law, where they have that secret federal court that covers it all up.
[01:26:24.014 --> 01:26:26.196]  This is so damn big.
[01:26:27.998 --> 01:26:28.918]  This is so huge.
[01:26:28.938 --> 01:26:30.319]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:26:30.399 --> 01:26:32.100]  Some stations don't carry this segment.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.761]  That's why we're going to get the doctor.
[01:26:33.781 --> 01:26:38.403]  You can see there on screen on with us coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:26:39.083 --> 01:26:41.404]  But I want to say something here that I talked about yesterday briefly.
[01:26:43.058 --> 01:26:49.963]  I promoted gold from the time that it was $300 an ounce and silver was $5 an ounce until silver was $20 and gold was $2,000.
[01:26:50.724 --> 01:26:54.186]  And then about a year before it started really going down, I said, I'd get out of gold now.
[01:26:54.907 --> 01:26:58.129]  And you notice eight years ago until now, I haven't had a gold sponsor to have promoted it.
[01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:01.632]  Now I've said, I think it's time to get back into gold and silver because hyperinflation is coming.
[01:27:02.453 --> 01:27:03.353]  Definitely inflation is here.
[01:27:03.373 --> 01:27:05.135]  It's the same thing.
[01:27:05.275 --> 01:27:09.438]  I haven't promoted storable foods hardly unless it's for an earthquake or a war.
[01:27:09.498 --> 01:27:12.180]  It's good to have some, but it wasn't that big of an emergency situation.
[01:27:13.359 --> 01:27:19.485]  Now, a year ago, I said these lockdowns are going to cause a breakdown in supply chains and cause food prices to explode.
[01:27:19.745 --> 01:27:25.590]  Well, here is the Bloomberg Agri-Global Spot Index, the highest in its, what, 30-year history.
[01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:30.255]  It's a 76% increase already in raw goods across the world.
[01:27:31.874 --> 01:27:33.235]  That is a global index.
[01:27:33.295 --> 01:27:36.377]  That is inflation, and it also means massive unrest.
[01:27:36.977 --> 01:27:44.162]  The Arab Spring, 10-11 years ago, only had a food increase for a little while of half of that, and you saw what happened.
[01:27:44.682 --> 01:27:47.504]  So we're going to see massive civil unrest.
[01:27:47.524 --> 01:27:50.506]  They're going to claim it's racial to cover up that it's really economic.
[01:27:50.526 --> 01:27:55.869]  They're going to try to bring in a universal global income, universal global social credit scores.
[01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:59.992]  This is the great reset, is the cover for the global collapse is the virus.
[01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:02.671]  Amazon triples its profits.
[01:28:02.952 --> 01:28:06.453]  All the other big companies double their profits because they're consolidating, we're imploding.
[01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:09.814]  That's why you want to get storable food now, ahead of the inflation.
[01:28:10.114 --> 01:28:11.294]  Plus, it's insurance you can eat.
[01:28:11.374 --> 01:28:13.715]  We've got high-quality, storable food ready to ship.
[01:28:14.215 --> 01:28:18.477]  But you're going to get back in a situation when people figure this out, that they'll be big, long waits again.
[01:28:18.837 --> 01:28:19.417]  Our sponsor...
[01:28:20.558 --> 01:28:22.539]  My Patriot Supply is the biggest and best in the country.
[01:28:22.959 --> 01:28:24.680]  One month, three months, six months, your supplies.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.342]  Go to preparewithalex.com, the subpage of infowarestore.com.
[01:28:28.602 --> 01:28:29.463]  They're in our computer.
[01:28:29.543 --> 01:28:30.263]  We're partnered with them.
[01:28:30.603 --> 01:28:33.345]  They are taking your orders off our secure shopping cart.
[01:28:33.785 --> 01:28:37.527]  You get 10% lower than even when you buy it from them or regularly from us.
[01:28:37.847 --> 01:28:39.008]  You cannot beat this deal.
[01:28:39.328 --> 01:28:40.289]  I have twisted their arm.
[01:28:40.489 --> 01:28:42.070]  We're only running it until next Sunday.
[01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:46.673]  So in eight days, this deal, eight and a half days, this deal will be over.
[01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:47.814]  It's always a great deal.
[01:28:48.394 --> 01:28:51.156]  And I'm telling you, they've already had to increase food prices a little bit three times.
[01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:52.437]  They're gonna have to do it again.
[01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:54.119]  Their competitors have gone way above this.
[01:28:55.279 --> 01:28:57.121]  Because the inflation's already there.
[01:28:57.561 --> 01:28:58.202]  It's like a cake.
[01:28:58.262 --> 01:28:59.082]  It's already baked in.
[01:28:59.122 --> 01:28:59.763]  It's just baking.
[01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:09.376]  You're going to see massive, massive food price increases, smaller packaging, more air in the packaging, more water injected into the food, more manipulation.
[01:29:09.496 --> 01:29:10.217]  They don't do that.
[01:29:10.697 --> 01:29:12.178]  Get your storable food while you can.
[01:29:12.238 --> 01:29:15.039]  And then, yes, it also funds our Operation 360Win.
[01:29:15.279 --> 01:29:16.140]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.861]  Why do you think Bill Gates is buying up all the farmland?
[01:29:19.181 --> 01:29:19.982]  He knows, folks.
[01:29:20.362 --> 01:29:22.563]  These monsters have triggered a global collapse.
[01:29:22.923 --> 01:29:24.464]  They intend to be on top of the end of it.
[01:29:24.684 --> 01:29:25.345]  We need to get ready now.
[01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:31.816]  There is so much massive breaking news, and I'll hit a little bit of it, starting the fourth hour.
[01:29:33.616 --> 01:29:36.838]  Like the Supreme Court just ruled illegal aliens can basically just stay here and do whatever they want.
[01:29:37.498 --> 01:29:38.658]  Because they're blackmailed, folks.
[01:29:38.678 --> 01:29:41.779]  They're controlled, and they're threatened to pack the court if the Republicans don't roll over.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.180]  This is a total takeover happening.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.560]  That's a new Newsmax article.
[01:29:45.861 --> 01:29:49.042]  Supreme Court backs illegal immigrants challenging deportation.
[01:29:49.662 --> 01:29:50.722]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:29:50.762 --> 01:29:52.803]  Thank you so much for joining us here.
[01:29:53.243 --> 01:29:55.544]  There have been ultra-massive developments
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:05.991]  Every authoritarian concern that we've had about the rollout of these Franken injections is now at warp speed, to use Trump's terms.
[01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:09.274]  And boy, did Trump get suckered into going into this.
[01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:10.035]  But he's gone now.
[01:30:10.095 --> 01:30:10.836]  We've got Joe Biden.
[01:30:11.437 --> 01:30:12.878]  Don't have Trump to kick around anymore.
[01:30:13.922 --> 01:30:26.707]  And I remember Dr. Carrie Madej coming on the show, I think she came on twice, about eight months ago and about six months ago, and just even longer, but laying it all out about this is not a vaccine, it's mRNA.
[01:30:27.167 --> 01:30:33.870]  They tried to deny that, now they had to admit it, and now we're seeing bombshell reports, 60% of new COVID patients are vaccinated.
[01:30:35.077 --> 01:30:40.699]  According to respected Yale medical doctor researchers, so there are many people that are getting it.
[01:30:40.899 --> 01:30:41.719]  They've already had the shot.
[01:30:41.739 --> 01:30:42.679]  They're getting really, really sick.
[01:30:42.959 --> 01:30:47.981]  People who've had the vaccine are having violent reactions, as we predicted, to regular cold viruses.
[01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:50.181]  There's a lot of different things that are happening here.
[01:30:50.281 --> 01:30:55.803]  CNN analyst says White House should tell Americans the moment of your freedom for you is when you get vaccinated.
[01:30:56.163 --> 01:30:57.764]  That's called being held hostage.
[01:30:58.364 --> 01:31:02.265]  Former Moderna CEO, current one, will never
[01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:08.484]  We'll need booster vaccine shots against COVID-19 variants starting this fall.
[01:31:08.784 --> 01:31:10.085]  See, quote, does it protect you?
[01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:14.566]  Vaccine shedding causing miscarriages and blood clots in unvaccinated females.
[01:31:15.007 --> 01:31:18.028]  Former Pfizer VP blows lid off vaccine scheme.
[01:31:18.428 --> 01:31:22.170]  Entirely possible this will be used for massive scale depopulation.
[01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:25.013]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:31:25.093 --> 01:31:28.696]  So, Doctor, thank you, Dr. Carey Madej, for joining us.
[01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:35.522]  I'm not going to go over your whole bio, but here is a shot of it for TV viewers, all the different places you've worked, universities and hospitals and clinics.
[01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:44.270]  And people can find you at Dr. Madej on Twitter or Carey Madej on Facebook or serendipitygroup.org.
[01:31:44.471 --> 01:31:46.532]  And Madej is spelled M-A-D-E-J.
[01:31:48.354 --> 01:31:49.655]  Doctor, thank you for joining us.
[01:31:50.336 --> 01:31:51.277]  Where do we start here?
[01:31:51.337 --> 01:31:53.378]  I mean, wow, so much has happened since you were last on.
[01:31:54.559 --> 01:31:55.220]  I know, Alex.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.321]  Thanks for having me back.
[01:31:57.002 --> 01:32:04.228]  I think the question on everyone's mind right now is, what about this so-called shedding?
[01:32:04.748 --> 01:32:11.955]  I've had, in one day, I asked my members, I said, does anyone have any problems with their menstrual cycle, infertility, etc.? ?
[01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:21.867]  Since being around someone who's been vaccinated, and I had over 700 responses within 6 to 12 hours.
[01:32:22.348 --> 01:32:23.169]  It's unbelievable.
[01:32:23.409 --> 01:32:30.116]  And my colleagues on the West Coast are saying they're seeing high, high rates of people having miscarriages, sometimes 400 times more.
[01:32:30.497 --> 01:32:34.581]  These are people that are not vaccinated that have been around people that were vaccinated.
[01:32:35.228 --> 01:32:40.153]  So, of course, my colleagues and I, we started to look into this and there's some problems.
[01:32:40.273 --> 01:32:43.076]  One problem is nobody knows what's inside the vials.
[01:32:43.436 --> 01:32:43.796]  Nobody.
[01:32:43.997 --> 01:32:45.738]  Nobody but the drug manufacturers.
[01:32:46.199 --> 01:32:49.942]  We have not had an independent group of people to analyze it.
[01:32:50.002 --> 01:32:50.823]  This is a problem.
[01:32:50.863 --> 01:32:54.627]  We have to trust their opinion, what's in there.
[01:32:55.147 --> 01:32:56.048]  So, the other thing is,
[01:32:57.284 --> 01:33:03.731]  You know, inside these vaccines, we're going to call them transmission, not shedding, because these are not a normal kind of injection.
[01:33:04.051 --> 01:33:05.853]  They don't have the actual organism.
[01:33:06.234 --> 01:33:10.699]  They have a code they're putting inside of you to program you to make
[01:33:11.548 --> 01:33:14.110]  And also, they're using nanotechnology.
[01:33:14.211 --> 01:33:15.572]  Now, these are brand new.
[01:33:15.592 --> 01:33:22.478]  Nanotechnology is pretty much, can be used almost like an antenna inside your body.
[01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:24.900]  So, there's some issues with that.
[01:33:25.341 --> 01:33:34.249]  So, we talked about that possibly, if there's contaminants in these vaccines, they could be, you know, shedding some sort of virus.
[01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:36.571]  All vaccines have contaminants in them.
[01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:37.632]  They have other infections.
[01:33:38.272 --> 01:33:44.037]  The other thing is that possibly these spike proteins could be somehow infectious to others.
[01:33:44.117 --> 01:33:44.858]  We don't know that.
[01:33:44.898 --> 01:33:46.219]  We don't have long-term studies.
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:49.722]  These are just things that people are bringing up as possibilities.
[01:33:50.503 --> 01:34:00.452]  Another thing that is a very interesting possibility is because we're using nanotechnology, because they have the ability to be like antennas or use as biosensors,
[01:34:01.204 --> 01:34:05.126]  What if they actually are emitting some kind of frequency out there?
[01:34:05.146 --> 01:34:08.408]  This is, I know it sounds sci-fi, but it's a possibility.
[01:34:09.108 --> 01:34:13.311]  And the last thing is, maybe it has nothing to do with these people being vaccinated.
[01:34:13.431 --> 01:34:19.514]  Perhaps what we are experiencing is something called microwave or EMF sickness or radiation sickness.
[01:34:19.614 --> 01:34:26.458]  Because if you look, if anyone has a meter around them, they'll see that the amount of EMFs that we've all been getting in our bodies
[01:34:27.402 --> 01:34:29.084]  Have been exponentially high.
[01:34:29.124 --> 01:34:33.507]  I know here in Atlanta, Georgia, where I'm at right now, the levels have gone up so high.
[01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:42.534]  And if you look at all the side effects, you'll see that many of them have to do with reproduction and flu-like illness as well.
[01:34:43.191 --> 01:34:45.393]  So lots of things going on with that.
[01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:53.319]  And then also, yes, we're VAERS database, it's between 1 and 10% of the actual adverse events are reported.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:35:00.265]  And in there, we're seeing almost 3000 deaths, and you know, 60,000 or more adverse events.
[01:35:00.425 --> 01:35:01.646]  This is unbelievable.
[01:35:02.222 --> 01:35:11.532]  In the previous years, if we had even 25 deaths from some kind of vaccine like this, we would have stopped production, put a moratorium, looked into it.
[01:35:11.952 --> 01:35:12.453]  Not now.
[01:35:12.633 --> 01:35:15.276]  We go forward without looking into what's going on.
[01:35:15.296 --> 01:35:22.223]  These are causing more and more very interesting or odd side effects that we cannot explain.
[01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:30.537]  So especially when it comes to fertility and what's happening right now, this could be affecting the future of humanity.
[01:35:30.557 --> 01:35:44.788]  So if we're seeing 400 times miscarriages, we're seeing so many different issues with abortions and people having problems with their menstrual cycles, what if this affects how we can reproduce as humanity in the future?
[01:35:44.808 --> 01:35:48.231]  We need to really take pause and look at this.
[01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:51.113]  This is a dangerous game that we're playing right now.
[01:35:52.401 --> 01:35:54.742]  Well, clearly, it's a giant genetic assault.
[01:35:54.823 --> 01:35:56.083]  It's a new type of war.
[01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:00.206]  And they figure it's going to be so bad by the time we figure it out, we'll just be trying to survive.
[01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:02.587]  And they'll somehow just change the subject again.
[01:36:02.908 --> 01:36:04.689]  Dr. Carrie Madej is here with us.
[01:36:05.049 --> 01:36:07.050]  And everything you said is in mainline literature.
[01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:09.312]  It sounds like sci-fi, but we're in the year 2021.
[01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:13.935]  And then AstraZeneca gets banned in all these countries.
[01:36:14.295 --> 01:36:16.256]  But then Biden gets it and dumps it on India.
[01:36:16.616 --> 01:36:17.817]  They're starving India to death.
[01:36:17.837 --> 01:36:20.399]  They call people dying from starvation, dying of COVID.
[01:36:21.119 --> 01:36:25.701]  You get, as you said, more people have died from vaccines this year than the whole year combined before.
[01:36:25.741 --> 01:36:27.662]  That's on the government's own website.
[01:36:27.922 --> 01:36:33.565]  I mean, they're not even really hiding all of this, but what they are is censoring people that put it together and talk about it.
[01:36:33.885 --> 01:36:38.047]  They put the fine print out, but then when you and others go and speak, they censor you.
[01:36:38.087 --> 01:36:39.168]  They've censored you massively.
[01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:43.964]  Of course, they're censoring anybody that's talking about this.
[01:36:44.684 --> 01:36:53.512]  And, you know, just know that there has been a concern for people transmitting something to unvaccinated people.
[01:36:53.592 --> 01:36:59.638]  Because in Pfizer's protocol, they said, if anybody comes in contact with someone that's been vaccinated,
[01:37:00.308 --> 01:37:09.051]  Um, or the vaccinated person comes in contact with an unvaccinated person, particularly if they're pregnant or they're trying to get pregnant reported immediately, there could be an issue.
[01:37:09.572 --> 01:37:15.914]  So here we have a drug company that knows there can be a possibility of some sort of a transmission.
[01:37:16.534 --> 01:37:18.575]  They never told this to us.
[01:37:18.635 --> 01:37:20.735]  They never told this to anybody around the world.
[01:37:20.755 --> 01:37:22.636]  They never told this to the medical professional.
[01:37:23.136 --> 01:37:25.017]  My gosh, what are we doing here?
[01:37:25.037 --> 01:37:26.477]  This is a Russian roulette.
[01:37:26.897 --> 01:37:30.699]  Why aren't they telling people about the real risks that they already know about?
[01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:42.483]  Well, you just said that the Pfizer, I showed it yesterday on air, we'll dig it out, they admitted that this can jump into pregnant women, this could affect babies, this could affect breastfeeding, and now we see the anecdotal reports everywhere.
[01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.223]  It's insane!
[01:37:44.795 --> 01:37:46.039]  You're absolutely right.
[01:37:46.259 --> 01:37:52.898]  And the more I'm looking into this and digging into this, just almost every woman that I know around me is having issues.
[01:37:53.846 --> 01:37:54.687]  I mean, it's not just 5%.
[01:37:55.387 --> 01:37:58.189]  We're talking about the large majority of people that I even know.
[01:37:58.229 --> 01:38:00.711]  I'm talking to people in all different states.
[01:38:00.891 --> 01:38:02.192]  All of them are having issues.
[01:38:02.652 --> 01:38:05.194]  Why aren't we putting a moratorium and looking into this?
[01:38:05.734 --> 01:38:07.315]  This is unbelievable.
[01:38:07.395 --> 01:38:10.897]  Doctor, that's what Wolfgang Wudarg and also the former head scientist of Pfizer said.
[01:38:10.937 --> 01:38:14.380]  He said, looking at this protein, it's very similar to what's in the uterus.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.561]  This is going to attack placentas and uteruses.
[01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:17.422]  And look what's happening.
[01:38:17.742 --> 01:38:20.143]  And you've got 80-year-old women going back on their menstrual cycle.
[01:38:20.504 --> 01:38:22.225]  Oh boy, Bill Gates is not going to get away with this.
[01:38:24.147 --> 01:38:29.529]  Yes, and also chromosome 8 can be affected in our body, which is fertility and intelligence.
[01:38:29.969 --> 01:38:31.070]  We can't forget about that.
[01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:32.170]  Wow, I forgot that.
[01:38:32.230 --> 01:38:32.930]  Stay there, doctor.
[01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:33.711]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:34.351]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:38:34.391 --> 01:38:35.911]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:38:35.951 --> 01:38:37.672]  This is an attack on humanity, folks.
[01:38:38.732 --> 01:38:39.693]  This is so sick.
[01:38:40.853 --> 01:38:42.354]  And Bill Gates says he wants to get rid of us.
[01:38:42.634 --> 01:38:43.895]  He says he wants to sterilize us.
[01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:46.256]  And now it's here with an untested thing.
[01:38:46.276 --> 01:38:48.737]  Because they did test it on animals and it killed a bunch of them.
[01:38:49.077 --> 01:38:51.038]  So they then skipped the trials officially.
[01:38:51.278 --> 01:38:52.539]  They know damn well what they're doing.
[01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:54.500]  We'll be right back with Dr. Carrie Madej.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.300]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:58.142]  Okay, Dr. Carrie Madej is a medical doctor.
[01:38:58.762 --> 01:39:01.663]  She looked at all the literature when they were first coming out with these so-called vaccines.
[01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:04.284]  For the war in the world last year.
[01:39:04.304 --> 01:39:07.146]  One of the first prominent people to speak up.
[01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.983]  And she joins us now for the rest of the hour.
[01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:31.592]  This is clearly, as the former chief scientist at Pfizer said, a depopulation program.
[01:39:32.293 --> 01:39:33.994]  The globalists have decided to go ahead with it.
[01:39:34.014 --> 01:39:34.974]  I think they can cover it up.
[01:39:34.994 --> 01:39:37.715]  It's going to cause all sorts of health problems, death, you name it.
[01:39:38.335 --> 01:39:40.196]  It's just a nightmare situation.
[01:39:40.236 --> 01:39:41.397]  So, Doc, please continue.
[01:39:43.178 --> 01:39:48.540]  I was talking about people having some sort of a transmission from people that have been vaccinated.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.981]  They're experiencing menstrual cycle symptoms.
[01:39:51.397 --> 01:39:52.958]  Increased miscarriages, etc.
[01:39:53.218 --> 01:39:56.360]  This is a very high number of people.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.761]  This is nothing to be ignored.
[01:39:57.801 --> 01:40:00.843]  It's just something that needs to be looked into.
[01:40:00.963 --> 01:40:06.706]  So we have to look at this because perhaps we are hurting ourselves much more than we're helping ourselves now.
[01:40:07.066 --> 01:40:09.368]  We don't know the ideology of this.
[01:40:09.388 --> 01:40:10.829]  We're only guessing at this point.
[01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:14.771]  We're not getting any help from our governments or international agencies or the well
[01:40:15.071 --> 01:40:20.013]  World Health Organization or the CDC, no one's helping us figure out what is going on.
[01:40:20.373 --> 01:40:21.934]  So they're not in our best interest.
[01:40:21.954 --> 01:40:23.114]  They're not for our health.
[01:40:23.694 --> 01:40:25.115]  So that's one issue.
[01:40:25.195 --> 01:40:36.359]  We also have the issue of we need to realize we're playing with our genetic, our genome, our genetic modification is happening on par with how they make genetically modified plants.
[01:40:36.899 --> 01:40:44.162]  And everybody needs to know this, that if any of these synthetic genes, which the spike protein has synthetic genes in them,
[01:40:45.052 --> 01:40:52.997]  If the synthetic gene gets integrated into our genome, which can happen because we have enzymes in our body that can do that.
[01:40:53.537 --> 01:40:59.881]  If that happens, then you can be owned by whoever owns that patent overnight.
[01:41:00.021 --> 01:41:07.826]  The Supreme Court justice has ruled that a human being can be owned if they have a synthetic gene or genome inside of them.
[01:41:08.522 --> 01:41:10.383]  And you can do that even as an adult.
[01:41:10.463 --> 01:41:12.084]  You can have a switch of your gene.
[01:41:12.104 --> 01:41:13.565]  You can have a switch of your genome.
[01:41:13.665 --> 01:41:15.186]  Even as an adult, we can do that.
[01:41:15.566 --> 01:41:19.288]  The technology inside these injections have the ability to do that.
[01:41:19.808 --> 01:41:22.970]  This alone should stop everything so that we could discuss this.
[01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.131]  This is a huge deal.
[01:41:24.811 --> 01:41:33.274]  On top of that, we know the animal studies showed that in the ferrets and the mice and the cats, that they did worse when they got this kind of injection, not better.
[01:41:33.794 --> 01:41:42.998]  They looked like they were okay at first, but when they were introduced to the virus in the future, they were sicker, more liver failure, more lung inflammation, and most of them died.
[01:41:43.038 --> 01:41:44.758]  In some studies, all of them died.
[01:41:45.358 --> 01:41:46.739]  Nobody's talking about that.
[01:41:47.339 --> 01:41:52.204]  We also know that they're introducing nanotechnology with these injections.
[01:41:52.664 --> 01:41:54.166]  Everybody needs to listen to this.
[01:41:54.666 --> 01:41:57.089]  Never before in humanity have we launched this.
[01:41:57.509 --> 01:42:05.437]  They're using something called a nanolipid particle that wraps around the code, which is functioning and tricks your body into accepting the code.
[01:42:05.797 --> 01:42:08.899]  It suppresses your immune system, your immune system checkpoints.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:20.768]  And when that happens, not only are your immune system being suppressed, you're accepting a code into your body which now you will be instructed to make and now you're spit out parts of these proteins.
[01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.969]  What will they do?
[01:42:21.989 --> 01:42:23.490]  We don't really know.
[01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:25.432]  The idea is for you to make antibodies.
[01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:33.449]  The whole point is this is a grand experiment on humanity and we have to understand the after effects of the nanotechnology.
[01:42:33.629 --> 01:42:34.930]  It doesn't leave your body.
[01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:36.390]  It stays in your body.
[01:42:36.891 --> 01:42:37.591]  And guess what?
[01:42:37.731 --> 01:42:40.433]  It has multiple uses by chance.
[01:42:41.193 --> 01:42:46.776]  And one of the uses of this nanotechnology is to use it as a biosensor.
[01:42:47.256 --> 01:42:49.477]  So biosensor means it's accumulating data.
[01:42:49.577 --> 01:42:52.579]  So really what this is saying is we're actually
[01:42:53.382 --> 01:42:58.304]  Having the start of artificial intelligence, in a way, being injected into the human body.
[01:42:58.324 --> 01:43:03.545]  And, you know, by definition, that would be the advent of something called transhumanism.
[01:43:03.605 --> 01:43:08.627]  So, you know, it looks like it's harmless, but just know, do you trust the people pushing the agenda?
[01:43:08.647 --> 01:43:11.868]  Do you trust their intentions, their motivations?
[01:43:11.928 --> 01:43:15.929]  Yeah, these are mad scientists that admit they're going to transcend humanity by testing on us.
[01:43:15.969 --> 01:43:18.010]  And what about all the mainstream articles where they go, oh,
[01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:27.413]  Men and women that take these mRNA vaccines, which are really franken-shots as you said, you're going to get swollen lymph nodes, swollen uterus, you're going to get fatty tumors.
[01:43:27.994 --> 01:43:29.434]  Don't have cancer surgery.
[01:43:29.714 --> 01:43:30.975]  These tumors are okay.
[01:43:31.215 --> 01:43:32.395]  I mean, what is that doing?
[01:43:32.435 --> 01:43:33.516]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:43:35.116 --> 01:43:37.357]  I'm embarrassed of my profession.
[01:43:37.397 --> 01:43:39.518]  I'm embarrassed of how science has gone.
[01:43:39.538 --> 01:43:42.699]  This does not make any sense.
[01:43:42.779 --> 01:43:44.140]  This is not good science.
[01:43:44.648 --> 01:43:47.909]  And people need to wake up that something's terribly wrong in our world.
[01:43:48.309 --> 01:43:50.370]  All the checks and balances have gone away.
[01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:55.811]  Governments aren't running like they normally do because it's the Emergency Act.
[01:43:56.131 --> 01:43:58.372]  And under that, there's cloak and dagger, right?
[01:43:58.452 --> 01:44:00.432]  We can't understand really what's going on.
[01:44:01.073 --> 01:44:06.074]  They're using German intelligence, the CIA, the UN, are all taking directives from Bill Gates.
[01:44:06.114 --> 01:44:07.334]  I mean, this is a big move.
[01:44:07.614 --> 01:44:12.116]  And they admit that they're, quote, watching anti-vaxxers and that it's national security to stop us.
[01:44:12.656 --> 01:44:12.836]  Wow.
[01:44:13.993 --> 01:44:14.653]  That is right.
[01:44:14.853 --> 01:44:18.915]  And you know, look at what Bill Gates is doing right now to the people of West Africa.
[01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:24.217]  He's testing these kinds of injections on them with a different intent.
[01:44:24.297 --> 01:44:27.878]  So they're getting these kinds of what you call vaccines injections.
[01:44:28.218 --> 01:44:40.423]  But also with the nanotechnology, he's actually looking at their biometrics, their biosensors, giving them a digital ID, and then using surveillance and predictive policing on them.
[01:44:41.371 --> 01:44:42.611]  Everybody needs to look that up.
[01:44:42.651 --> 01:44:44.252]  He is doing this as we speak.
[01:44:44.432 --> 01:44:52.755]  And in this article, they actually say once they have it perfected in Africa, they will then unveil it to all developed countries.
[01:44:52.815 --> 01:44:53.515]  That means us.
[01:44:54.435 --> 01:45:00.937]  So do you want this kind of technology to be used as surveillance and predictive policing and give you a digital ID?
[01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:03.918]  They're working with MasterCard for cryptocurrency.
[01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:05.419]  This is not sci-fi.
[01:45:05.459 --> 01:45:07.039]  We're doing it in real time now.
[01:45:07.179 --> 01:45:09.940]  So we need to speak up before it comes to our countries.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.883]  Well, my dad worked at MB Anderson Cancer Research when he was at UT.
[01:45:14.484 --> 01:45:27.055]  He was in Plan 2, actually in high school he was already there, and he said some of the scientists would get off in the experimental labs on people missing lower mandibles, people when they were injecting them with like radioactive isotopes, people signed off to do lethal things for science.
[01:45:27.375 --> 01:45:29.777]  That some of the scientists got off on the killing people.
[01:45:29.817 --> 01:45:31.178]  My dad really got freaked out by that.
[01:45:31.498 --> 01:45:32.639]  He was like 16 years old.
[01:45:32.899 --> 01:45:36.621]  He told me about it when I was a child, how to get off killing lab rats, things like that.
[01:45:36.982 --> 01:45:45.007]  When you look at Bill Gates, when he's on CNN talking about depopulation, collapse of society, Fareed Zarkaria says, he's a globalist, we're never coming back.
[01:45:45.047 --> 01:45:46.608]  It's the end of industrial civilization.
[01:45:47.128 --> 01:45:49.790]  Gates begins to just giggle and smile and wiggle.
[01:45:50.130 --> 01:45:53.593]  And when he was on other shows talking about terrorists, they're going to release something worse.
[01:45:53.973 --> 01:45:55.535]  This is just the beginning of the Great Reset.
[01:45:55.775 --> 01:46:01.842]  He's smiling about it the way my dad described people getting off on basically killing people.
[01:46:03.764 --> 01:46:07.669]  Have you run into these mad scientist doctors during your residency or during your training?
[01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:14.840]  Yes, I mean recently I attended over five years ago meetings where the scientists were there.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:21.024]  The father of human genomics, Dr. Craig Venter, and other scientists from around the world were there.
[01:46:21.304 --> 01:46:26.748]  Also business owners meetings here in Georgia where they discussed the future of humanity.
[01:46:26.788 --> 01:46:29.509]  They discussed using this kind of nanotechnology.
[01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:36.094]  They discussed trying to control and surveil people with their smart devices with the substance already embedded inside of them.
[01:46:37.075 --> 01:46:41.959]  These are, it's unbelievable when you're there and you see their eyes and you see their intention.
[01:46:42.739 --> 01:46:44.040]  They're not like you or me.
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:50.565]  They don't seem to have compassion or empathy and they believe that somehow that they have the right to make decisions for us.
[01:46:50.666 --> 01:46:53.508]  By the way, doctor, you were on, what was it, six, eight months ago.
[01:46:53.528 --> 01:46:57.671]  I had forgotten that you were already awake because you were let into one of these secret groups.
[01:46:58.072 --> 01:47:00.333]  So that was not like a trick question where I knew what you were going to say.
[01:47:00.353 --> 01:47:00.994]  I'd forgotten.
[01:47:01.094 --> 01:47:01.574]  Stay there.
[01:47:01.955 --> 01:47:05.277]  Come back and tell people the same story because my dad told me the same story.
[01:47:06.278 --> 01:47:17.506]  The head of the botany department, once he was actually in UT, once he was like 18, called him in, you know, the top six smartest students, and told them basically the same thing you're saying right now, but this was like in 1967.
[01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:20.328]  We're gonna go on a break with our guest.
[01:47:20.609 --> 01:47:24.612]  Folks, this is the cult, and you know, she's a smart doctor, she's a beautiful woman.
[01:47:24.952 --> 01:47:29.415]  I mean, that's the people they recruit is the best and brightest, because they want these people, and they try to recruit her.
[01:47:29.715 --> 01:47:30.456]  They try to recruit my dad.
[01:47:30.496 --> 01:47:32.678]  This is so damn real, folks.
[01:47:32.958 --> 01:47:33.518]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:33.538 --> 01:47:33.918]  Stay with us.
[01:47:34.739 --> 01:47:40.608]  Liana Nguyen is part of Planned Parenthood, the Rockefeller Foundation, and that's the heart of the whole eugenics movement.
[01:47:40.628 --> 01:47:48.740]  They created the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, they funded Adolf Hitler, IBM was set up to do it, Cold Springs Harbor, and this is the real cult running things.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:49.681]  It's beyond Hitler.
[01:47:50.695 --> 01:47:53.278]  Uh, they want to post human world.
[01:47:53.498 --> 01:47:54.279]  They want to play God.
[01:47:54.299 --> 01:48:01.227]  And here she is yesterday on CNN saying, we're going to hold you hostage because you're not going to be a good person.
[01:48:01.247 --> 01:48:02.168]  You're going to be selfish.
[01:48:02.549 --> 01:48:07.094]  So you can't have freedom until you take whatever we want to put in your body, which is called rape.
[01:48:07.294 --> 01:48:07.655]  Here it is.
[01:48:08.473 --> 01:48:12.115]  But I think a lot of people are thinking kind of selfishly, thinking, what's in it for me?
[01:48:12.635 --> 01:48:15.477]  And they're not willing to wait until this elusive herd immunity.
[01:48:15.917 --> 01:48:26.082]  If we can tell those individuals who otherwise would not get vaccinated, if we say to them, the moment of freedom for you is when you get vaccinated, when you reach the two week mark.
[01:48:26.482 --> 01:48:28.483]  These are people who otherwise might not be vaccinated.
[01:48:28.583 --> 01:48:29.984]  So let's give them that incentive.
[01:48:30.914 --> 01:48:32.495]  Ah, let's give them slavery.
[01:48:32.515 --> 01:48:34.237]  Of course, that's all heavily scripted.
[01:48:34.697 --> 01:48:38.800]  Dr. Carey Madej, you can find you at serendipitygroup.org.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.782]  You're incredible, what you're breaking down.
[01:48:40.802 --> 01:48:46.906]  And I'd forgotten that you were already kind of primed to this because they took you, I think, a meeting in, you were saying in Georgia.
[01:48:47.827 --> 01:48:51.810]  Describe that meeting where this whole scientific dictatorship tried to recruit you.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:59.062]  Yes, this was actually a business owners meeting and we had to be bused into the location.
[01:48:59.202 --> 01:49:00.462]  Our cell phones were jammed.
[01:49:00.482 --> 01:49:02.142]  This is around 2014.
[01:49:02.883 --> 01:49:05.563]  And we were locked in the building until the meeting was done.
[01:49:05.603 --> 01:49:09.625]  And this was a lot of big tech people, CNN, etc, etc.
[01:49:09.825 --> 01:49:10.645]  I was a small fish.
[01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:27.664]  And in there they talked about how they were going to change and modify the behavior of the people of Georgia with using their smart device, a health app on there, and with somehow getting, they didn't tell us how, a substance inside of their body that would be used as biosensors.
[01:49:28.184 --> 01:49:35.229]  The idea is they felt people here are too racist and they're not amenable to different cultures, so they took it upon themselves to change people.
[01:49:35.988 --> 01:49:42.744]  And this is how I know about all these substances inside these injections, because this is how I learned about them.
[01:49:43.339 --> 01:49:48.643]  They said these substances would analyze your data, your thoughts, your emotions.
[01:49:49.004 --> 01:49:51.546]  They knew if you're lying by a voice inflection app.
[01:49:51.986 --> 01:49:56.710]  Also, they knew if you're lying by a polygraph test with your sweat glands, they can do that.
[01:49:57.170 --> 01:50:01.313]  Also, your blood sugar level, your electrolytes, your breathing.
[01:50:01.333 --> 01:50:04.836]  Also, you know, if you're having sex, they are interested in that.
[01:50:04.896 --> 01:50:09.260]  If you're drinking alcohol, if you're taking drugs, they know everything about you.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.881]  Literally, they said they could do it.
[01:50:11.301 --> 01:50:36.347]  So they're going to analyze this data and then they had an algorithm that a computer would be in charge of and every time you lied, even a little white lie about where you were, the smartphone would know it immediately by these parameters and give you an instant repercussion and then also over let's say one to three months all the lies would be added up and then you would be considered either a good human or bad human and the computer would allot you
[01:50:36.887 --> 01:50:39.588]  A social credit system or cryptocurrency.
[01:50:39.608 --> 01:50:41.089]  Now, you said this on my show.
[01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:42.570]  I keep trying to remember.
[01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:43.230]  I should look the data.
[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:44.171]  When were you last on?
[01:50:44.191 --> 01:50:45.531]  When did you first go public?
[01:50:46.552 --> 01:50:50.053]  I guess maybe it was around June, July, something like that.
[01:50:50.253 --> 01:50:52.134]  Okay, so we're talking eight, nine months ago, ten months ago.
[01:50:52.194 --> 01:50:57.417]  Now, you said all this on the show then, and I believe you because I know about these groups and how it works.
[01:50:57.937 --> 01:51:02.379]  But just two weeks ago on 60 Minutes, they came out and said the exact thing you just said.
[01:51:02.399 --> 01:51:04.640]  I mean, wow.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.201]  So now they're really rolling this out.
[01:51:07.506 --> 01:51:07.726]  Yeah.
[01:51:08.507 --> 01:51:16.511]  And you know, here in Atlanta, we are one of the pilot cities they're supposed to unveil it in, maybe 12 across the U.S.
[01:51:16.691 --> 01:51:20.313]  But right now, they're in the testing phase in West Africa as we speak.
[01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:22.634]  So they are doing it to the people there.
[01:51:22.795 --> 01:51:29.438]  And there, Bill Gates even, you know, he talks about this will be used for predictive policing, like the minority report, Tom Cruise.
[01:51:29.618 --> 01:51:32.160]  He actually says it in the advertisement for this research.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.543]  He says that it's used for surveillance.
[01:51:34.944 --> 01:51:40.171]  He says that if you do not get this injection that you will be locked out of the system, whatever that means.
[01:51:40.852 --> 01:51:43.496]  They also say that this will assign you your digital ID.
[01:51:43.856 --> 01:51:45.519]  This is not sci-fi anymore.
[01:51:45.539 --> 01:51:49.004]  These people in Africa are experiencing it right now as we speak.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:53.721]  So, like I said, I have this knowledge from the meetings I attended.
[01:51:53.801 --> 01:51:57.842]  I also attended World Congress meetings with scientists from around the world.
[01:51:58.522 --> 01:52:00.042]  They're all on board as well.
[01:52:00.182 --> 01:52:08.224]  They talked about how they can manipulate our genomics through this CRISPR technology, transfection, which they are using in these injections.
[01:52:08.304 --> 01:52:09.125]  And let me just stop you.
[01:52:09.165 --> 01:52:15.086]  When you grab a whale or a shark or a lion, they don't ask permission to put a tracker in it.
[01:52:15.586 --> 01:52:18.068]  And so while you've been talking, we've been putting up mainline literature.
[01:52:18.588 --> 01:52:19.469]  They admit they're doing this.
[01:52:19.489 --> 01:52:24.653]  The first time I heard of this was back during the H1N1 flu, 10 years ago or whatever it was.
[01:52:25.413 --> 01:52:32.118]  A year before, they admitted they were putting a simulant virus that was nanotech genetically engineered in to test the spread of flus.
[01:52:32.399 --> 01:52:38.883]  They called it harmless, but it really became the H1N1 and was actually causing people to grow, grow,
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:40.360]  I think so.
[01:53:04.867 --> 01:53:07.390]  These are only for the best people, but this is proprietary information.
[01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:10.554]  We can't let this out, because this company only wants to give you the secret.
[01:53:11.175 --> 01:53:13.739]  Did they have you sign a form agreeing to non-disclose?
[01:53:14.039 --> 01:53:18.264]  Or what was it like to get put on a bus, have your phone taken away, and be taken there?
[01:53:18.284 --> 01:53:19.206]  Because they did this on 9-11.
[01:53:20.367 --> 01:53:25.328]  At an Air Force base, they asked all these CEOs to come the day before, said it was a national security emergency.
[01:53:25.748 --> 01:53:27.748]  They put them all at 6 a.m.
[01:53:27.908 --> 01:53:28.308]  in there.
[01:53:28.688 --> 01:53:31.409]  They had Jumbotron TVs, the towers being blown up.
[01:53:31.749 --> 01:53:33.589]  We don't know what they told them this day.
[01:53:33.869 --> 01:53:34.709]  They followed orders.
[01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:36.750]  But that's not even came out.
[01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:42.311]  They did that, by the way, that something secret happened on 9-11 inside that that that hangar.
[01:53:43.051 --> 01:53:48.852]  So describe to people, how did they recruit you into the first level of this before you obviously refused and weren't part of it?
[01:53:50.087 --> 01:53:52.688]  Uh, well, I didn't really know what I was getting into.
[01:53:52.768 --> 01:53:55.549]  I thought this is just, you know, more for political reasons.
[01:53:55.569 --> 01:53:57.090]  This is a good idea to join.
[01:53:57.110 --> 01:53:58.351]  I didn't for a year.
[01:53:58.371 --> 01:54:00.772]  I had three different people encourage me.
[01:54:00.832 --> 01:54:07.214]  And finally I went to, um, the first meeting, which I just described, which I was completely taken aback.
[01:54:07.234 --> 01:54:08.735]  No one prepared me for that.
[01:54:09.315 --> 01:54:12.896]  I tried to leave the building and they laughed at me and they said, go ahead.
[01:54:12.916 --> 01:54:15.778]  When they unlocked the doors, um, my cell phone still didn't work.
[01:54:15.818 --> 01:54:17.638]  And I, I, I didn't know where my car was.
[01:54:17.718 --> 01:54:18.859]  Obviously it was best in.
[01:54:19.359 --> 01:54:25.202]  So I was stuck there and there was a non-disclosure in general that was signed but not for that particular meeting.
[01:54:25.222 --> 01:54:26.962]  That's how it works.
[01:54:26.982 --> 01:54:29.443]  They say, oh, it's a business mentoring group.
[01:54:29.664 --> 01:54:34.846]  So for a year they vetted you, tested you, watched you and then decided to try to bring you in real first level.
[01:54:34.866 --> 01:54:35.006]  Wow.
[01:54:36.553 --> 01:54:43.798]  Yes, and I don't care if I had a nondisclosure in the general sense, because these are crimes against humanity.
[01:54:44.218 --> 01:54:46.980]  This should never be done to a human against their will.
[01:54:47.461 --> 01:54:53.645]  And they even said that they were going to do it without asking permission, that they would just unveil it onto the people.
[01:54:54.986 --> 01:54:56.187]  And that's what they're doing now.
[01:54:56.247 --> 01:54:57.608]  How do you think we counter this?
[01:54:57.648 --> 01:55:00.390]  Because, I mean, they have made a criminal move so huge.
[01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:04.713]  They think we're all going to have Stockholm Syndrome and we'll just roll over to this.
[01:55:04.853 --> 01:55:06.074]  I think they've miscalculated.
[01:55:07.185 --> 01:55:09.206]  Yes, this is our window of opportunity.
[01:55:09.286 --> 01:55:12.649]  The more people that wake up, the more frightened they are.
[01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:18.432]  This is why they're doing a blitzkrieg of advertising and pressuring us and coercing us into getting the jabs.
[01:55:18.873 --> 01:55:21.194]  Because if each one of us wake up, they lose their power.
[01:55:21.774 --> 01:55:26.678]  And just know that these are cumulative effects, all of these jabs that they're giving everyone.
[01:55:27.578 --> 01:55:29.359]  Perhaps one injection won't do it.
[01:55:29.499 --> 01:55:32.921]  They don't even know how many it will take to get the payload into us.
[01:55:33.202 --> 01:55:37.104]  Because we are in the middle of a live experiment, they are truly experimenting on us.
[01:55:37.624 --> 01:55:43.088]  So they're using these jabs, but just remember, they are using this sci-fi nanotechnology.
[01:55:43.528 --> 01:55:47.030]  It is affected by EMFs and frequencies.
[01:55:47.546 --> 01:55:53.510]  So I tell people one of the most important things you do right now is to make sure you're not getting too much of these EMS.
[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:54.770]  It makes you sick anyway.
[01:55:55.291 --> 01:56:03.515]  So I would recommend getting a meter, checking your house out, checking your phone out, doing protective measures that helps you with your health already.
[01:56:04.676 --> 01:56:06.017]  But you know, say no to this.
[01:56:06.077 --> 01:56:07.758]  Say no to being experimented on.
[01:56:07.798 --> 01:56:12.701]  Say no to loss of your sovereignty, your privacy, your autonomy.
[01:56:13.482 --> 01:56:17.766]  You're losing your mind in essence because they will know your thoughts.
[01:56:17.886 --> 01:56:21.990]  Well, Doctor, this is like invaders from Mars or something.
[01:56:22.210 --> 01:56:24.693]  This is a science fiction movie and it's really happening.
[01:56:26.014 --> 01:56:26.515]  You're right.
[01:56:26.795 --> 01:56:28.817]  I just couldn't believe that this would happen.
[01:56:28.957 --> 01:56:33.562]  And then when it was unveiled with these ingredients I saw in these injections,
[01:56:34.757 --> 01:56:40.383]  I was just depressed and saddened and then I got angry and that's when I started speaking up about it.
[01:56:40.403 --> 01:56:42.084]  I said, we have to warn people.
[01:56:42.124 --> 01:56:44.566]  We have time to stop this.
[01:56:44.646 --> 01:56:45.567]  We absolutely do.
[01:56:45.587 --> 01:56:51.293]  So if we band together, we unite our voices, we speak up, we educate our brothers and sisters around the world,
[01:56:51.773 --> 01:56:53.634]  We say no to these draconian measures.
[01:56:53.675 --> 01:56:55.036]  We say no to a passport.
[01:56:55.176 --> 01:56:56.276]  No one gives us our freedom.
[01:56:56.356 --> 01:56:57.157]  We have freedom.
[01:56:57.217 --> 01:56:58.318]  It's God given to us.
[01:56:58.478 --> 01:56:59.259]  That's right.
[01:56:59.519 --> 01:56:59.939]  Stay there.
[01:56:59.999 --> 01:57:00.319]  Stay there.
[01:57:00.339 --> 01:57:00.880]  You're just amazing.
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:02.321]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[01:57:02.341 --> 01:57:03.302]  You're totally vindicated.
[01:57:03.582 --> 01:57:04.583]  We're in the middle of a nightmare.
[01:57:04.623 --> 01:57:05.663]  Denying it only makes it worse.
[01:57:05.964 --> 01:57:06.844]  Fighting back makes it better.
[01:57:06.864 --> 01:57:08.465]  We'll talk about solutions on the other side.
[01:57:08.485 --> 01:57:08.826]  Stay with us.
[01:57:09.815 --> 01:57:12.676]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's the final segment of the third hour.
[01:57:12.696 --> 01:57:19.399]  I'll continue with another special guest host in the fourth hour, but I was just talking to Dr. Carrie Madej, who's an incredible person.
[01:57:19.879 --> 01:57:22.400]  She's not just a medical doctor with a great resume and great history.
[01:57:23.101 --> 01:57:26.942]  She also gets the big picture, and she gets that we're all targeted.
[01:57:26.962 --> 01:57:27.922]  I'm like, I bet you've been targeted.
[01:57:27.963 --> 01:57:30.023]  Yes, I've been targeted, but we're all targeted.
[01:57:30.504 --> 01:57:33.465]  The sooner you realize that, the sooner you're not a victim, you're fighting back.
[01:57:34.025 --> 01:57:40.310]  To this technocracy that wants to play God and wall us off like we're a bunch of Netflix-watching, you know, drunken idiots.
[01:57:40.851 --> 01:57:41.551]  And none of us are paranoid.
[01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:42.912]  I like to watch Netflix and drink, too.
[01:57:43.233 --> 01:57:45.435]  My point is that things are so serious, I don't even drink anymore.
[01:57:45.855 --> 01:57:48.137]  This is a war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:48.177 --> 01:57:49.998]  This is a societal takeover.
[01:57:50.018 --> 01:57:52.040]  It's not like some niche thing we talk about.
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.201]  It's everything.
[01:57:53.301 --> 01:57:54.542]  It's the Great Reset.
[01:57:54.582 --> 01:57:55.283]  Klaus Schwab said,
[01:57:56.408 --> 01:58:01.251]  In the future with the Great Reset, said this two years ago, we will not change the environment, we will change your cells.
[01:58:01.611 --> 01:58:03.152]  We're going to merge you with machine.
[01:58:03.452 --> 01:58:05.213]  We're going to take over your DNA.
[01:58:05.493 --> 01:58:06.634]  We're going to implant you.
[01:58:07.114 --> 01:58:07.935]  You will have nothing.
[01:58:07.975 --> 01:58:08.815]  You will own nothing.
[01:58:09.035 --> 01:58:09.736]  You will like it.
[01:58:09.756 --> 01:58:11.977]  I mean, this is, this is happening.
[01:58:12.037 --> 01:58:14.699]  So, in the ten minutes we have left, Dr. Carey, I'm a day.
[01:58:15.646 --> 01:58:16.627]  You're doing this of your own accord.
[01:58:16.867 --> 01:58:18.148]  I'm like, you have a book, you have a film.
[01:58:18.509 --> 01:58:19.830]  She's not even really doing a practice right now.
[01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:21.551]  She's just fighting, fighting.
[01:58:21.571 --> 01:58:23.413]  She's just here doing this for humanity.
[01:58:25.655 --> 01:58:31.080]  So the time we have, get into big picture, 35,000 foot view, where this is going, what we can do.
[01:58:31.461 --> 01:58:35.624]  You say you talk to folks, hundreds of women saying that they're having the same problems.
[01:58:36.445 --> 01:58:38.607]  You're saying that you talk to people in other countries.
[01:58:38.927 --> 01:58:40.389]  Repeat what you told me during that break.
[01:58:45.728 --> 01:58:47.049]  And of course, the Skype froze.
[01:58:47.389 --> 01:58:48.809]  Man, that lady has seen it all.
[01:58:49.169 --> 01:58:59.514]  And the great part about doctors is they talk to patients, people confide in them, they talk to a lot of folks, and I am just... People ask, Jones, how do you get so excited about all this?
[01:58:59.714 --> 01:59:00.394]  What the hell?
[01:59:00.454 --> 01:59:01.895]  It's like an alien takeover!
[01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:05.236]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:59:07.057 --> 01:59:14.940]  And I just... Tomorrow, from noon to two, I'm taping with Dr. Francis Boyle and others that are there at four o'clock or so.
[01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:32.803]  That'll restream until the Sunday show because these Saturday shows are really reaching people and they're basically commercial free by that we might have a break or something in there but it's not like the radio TV format and it is just so incredibly important that all of you watching this
[01:59:33.544 --> 01:59:38.208]  Get this information and share it and check it out for yourself, because I already know a lot of this stuff.
[01:59:38.248 --> 01:59:38.909]  I know most of it.
[01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:41.471]  And while she's talking, the crew's just pulling up more stuff.
[01:59:41.811 --> 01:59:43.253]  Mainstream news, how they're doing this.
[01:59:43.333 --> 01:59:44.994]  Okay, her Skype is back.
[01:59:45.415 --> 01:59:52.561]  Dr. Madej, 35,000-foot view of what you were telling me during the break about people you're talking to, the incredible things they're hearing around the world.
[01:59:52.801 --> 01:59:54.243]  It's not just Biden that's a puppet.
[01:59:54.563 --> 01:59:56.064]  Suddenly, they're putting puppets in everywhere.
[01:59:56.324 --> 01:59:57.365]  This is the global takeover.
[01:59:57.385 --> 01:59:57.866]  Tell us about it.
[01:59:59.482 --> 02:00:02.384]  Yes, everyone needs to see that there is a bigger agenda right now.
[02:00:02.404 --> 02:00:03.344]  There's a bigger plan.
[02:00:03.364 --> 02:00:05.786]  It has nothing to do about this invisible virus.
[02:00:06.767 --> 02:00:08.988]  If you look at every country, talk to the people there.
[02:00:09.008 --> 02:00:13.871]  They're saying the same thing, that they don't feel that their president or prime minister is the one really in charge.
[02:00:13.971 --> 02:00:15.092]  They say there's another group.
[02:00:15.712 --> 02:00:18.613]  Running the show, they know something's not right.
[02:00:20.334 --> 02:00:21.695]  Just look at the big picture.
[02:00:21.715 --> 02:00:23.816]  The data doesn't make sense.
[02:00:23.856 --> 02:00:27.898]  The death rate was the same as all the previous five years.
[02:00:28.238 --> 02:00:29.218]  Why are we doing this?
[02:00:29.558 --> 02:00:31.259]  Why are we using something experimental?
[02:00:31.359 --> 02:00:36.101]  Why is the benefit only, maybe it's a partial immunity for two months, maybe.
[02:00:36.542 --> 02:00:38.603]  And the risks are astronomical.
[02:00:39.043 --> 02:00:42.584]  Nobody in their right mind, no good doctor, no good scientist could recommend this.
[02:00:42.604 --> 02:00:43.665]  So why are they?
[02:00:44.225 --> 02:00:51.510]  Because the endgame is getting these jabs inside of you so they can introduce this kind of technology inside of you.
[02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:54.172]  Also to thin out the herd, get rid of the weak ones.
[02:00:54.312 --> 02:01:01.977]  And who's ever left over will have this technology, it's really artificial intelligence, that can be used for good or bad.
[02:01:02.378 --> 02:01:04.479]  And right now it looks like they're going to use it for bad.
[02:01:04.539 --> 02:01:08.882]  To control you, to surveil you, to even make you not even think the things
[02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:16.681]  Look at this because this is not just me saying it or Alex saying this.
[02:01:16.921 --> 02:01:17.621]  This is real.
[02:01:17.661 --> 02:01:19.122]  There's so many references.
[02:01:19.182 --> 02:01:22.364]  I have a lot of references, over 200 about these things.
[02:01:22.884 --> 02:01:34.071]  Please look what's going on because if we consent to these things, if we consent to more and more of this technology, to these digital passports, and accept these kind of experimental things inside of our bodies,
[02:01:34.841 --> 02:01:35.841]  One day it'll be too late.
[02:01:35.881 --> 02:01:37.502]  We won't be able to act on it.
[02:01:37.562 --> 02:01:39.563]  We won't be able to think enough to act on it.
[02:01:40.083 --> 02:01:43.665]  So I say that this is the endgame of all games.
[02:01:44.105 --> 02:01:45.565]  This is do or die right now.
[02:01:46.066 --> 02:01:47.126]  It's about human 1.0.
[02:01:47.566 --> 02:01:49.547]  Do you value being a human?
[02:01:49.567 --> 02:01:52.888]  Do you value having freedom of thought and to love?
[02:01:53.329 --> 02:01:55.830]  If you do, then you stand up now and you say no.
[02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:58.391]  You say no and take our human rights back.
[02:01:58.451 --> 02:01:59.211]  We gave them away.
[02:01:59.971 --> 02:02:02.474]  And we stand together because we are powerful beings.
[02:02:02.534 --> 02:02:03.935]  We are made in the likeness of God.
[02:02:04.436 --> 02:02:06.578]  We actually have energy and light in us.
[02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:08.360]  We don't need their technology.
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.644]  We are magnificent beings and stick together because we have power in that.
[02:02:12.704 --> 02:02:14.706]  And just look at the HeartMath Institute.
[02:02:14.746 --> 02:02:16.828]  There's science on the energy of our heart.
[02:02:17.248 --> 02:02:19.130]  We actually make electromagnetic energy.
[02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:20.191]  We're energetic beings.
[02:02:20.551 --> 02:02:26.036]  It goes six feet out from our bodies, and strong people, it goes out even miles.
[02:02:26.296 --> 02:02:27.097]  Imagine that.
[02:02:27.177 --> 02:02:34.764]  Imagine enough of us finally getting into that love, not in fear, not in panic, getting into the love, that high frequency, standing up.
[02:02:35.185 --> 02:02:36.806]  We take our planet back.
[02:02:36.886 --> 02:02:37.407]  It's ours.
[02:02:38.027 --> 02:02:40.310]  And so we already have the paradise here.
[02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:43.253]  We can make it the paradise we always wanted it to be.
[02:02:43.293 --> 02:02:44.534]  We always thought it can be.
[02:02:44.974 --> 02:02:48.258]  So just say no to these draconian measures.
[02:02:48.298 --> 02:02:49.859]  Say no to being an experiment.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.083]  And we need to start meeting with each other once a week.
[02:02:53.143 --> 02:02:54.985]  Start sharing this information with others.
[02:02:55.445 --> 02:02:56.586]  This is not about a virus, guys.
[02:02:56.606 --> 02:02:56.927]  That's the thing.
[02:02:56.947 --> 02:02:58.628]  They really don't want us to meet together.
[02:02:59.469 --> 02:03:00.369]  With higher frequency.
[02:03:00.409 --> 02:03:01.170]  Call it whatever you want.
[02:03:01.590 --> 02:03:02.170]  Churches.
[02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:02.970]  Bars.
[02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:04.251]  These people having fun together.
[02:03:04.551 --> 02:03:05.851]  They hate human communion.
[02:03:05.891 --> 02:03:06.892]  It's very alien.
[02:03:07.192 --> 02:03:08.672]  It's very alien how they operate.
[02:03:08.692 --> 02:03:12.954]  I don't get into speculation about what's behind this, but I mean it's all very anti-human.
[02:03:14.730 --> 02:03:25.858]  I mean, I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and I think there are a lot of truths in the Bible, and I do believe that we are seeing an evil versus good kind of war happening here, a spiritual war.
[02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:26.098]  Exactly.
[02:03:26.118 --> 02:03:26.779]  What's the Bible say?
[02:03:26.819 --> 02:03:34.924]  There's a fallen entity that hates us because we're made in the image of God, that wants to destroy us and use us, and it's basically an evil alien force, and it makes perfect sense.
[02:03:35.325 --> 02:03:36.005]  I mean, look at Biden.
[02:03:36.045 --> 02:03:36.866]  It's a mockery.
[02:03:37.126 --> 02:03:38.847]  It's a mockery of everything God is.
[02:03:38.887 --> 02:03:42.530]  They want us to be united, but be united with an AI hive mind.
[02:03:43.110 --> 02:03:44.191]  No, we're already united.
[02:03:44.231 --> 02:03:45.291]  We're spiritual beings.
[02:03:45.411 --> 02:03:46.232]  We don't need them.
[02:03:46.732 --> 02:03:48.933]  They want us to live immortal, to be immortal.
[02:03:49.133 --> 02:03:54.336]  Yeah, but in an image of ourselves just downloading and uploading memories into a digital avatar.
[02:03:54.396 --> 02:03:55.777]  Look at what they want us to be.
[02:03:56.177 --> 02:03:58.038]  That's not immortality to me.
[02:03:58.298 --> 02:03:59.558]  I'm a soul.
[02:03:59.638 --> 02:04:00.239]  I'm eternal.
[02:04:00.339 --> 02:04:01.159]  I don't need them.
[02:04:01.219 --> 02:04:01.519]  Exactly.
[02:04:01.559 --> 02:04:02.600]  Our souls are eternal.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:03.300]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.581]  But we also live through our progeny as well.
[02:04:05.601 --> 02:04:06.762]  That's a whole other life.
[02:04:07.042 --> 02:04:09.704]  It's literally, we have, we are in so many dimensions.
[02:04:09.724 --> 02:04:12.305]  This is just the third dimension, our physical manifestation.
[02:04:13.829 --> 02:04:14.409]  Exactly.
[02:04:14.810 --> 02:04:27.919]  And just know that, unbelievably, but when they're patenting a genome of any organism, including a human, they can do it, they're actually writing their names inside the genome because you can read it like a book, like a language.
[02:04:27.939 --> 02:04:31.942]  It's like gang members putting a tattoo on a woman that they've enslaved, but.
[02:04:32.362 --> 02:04:33.883]  Or it's like branding the side of a cow.
[02:04:33.923 --> 02:04:37.365]  I mean, it's like gang members putting their tags on the side of the street.
[02:04:37.565 --> 02:04:40.968]  And Bill Gates literally wants to etch his name into our DNA.
[02:04:42.521 --> 02:04:43.041]  It's true.
[02:04:43.182 --> 02:04:45.203]  You can look it up on Wikipedia right now.
[02:04:45.763 --> 02:05:00.894]  Dr. Craig Venter, if you look at his bio, he talks about his work and how he can do synthetic organisms and how he's putting these messages, secret emails, he's putting their names and he's putting a new alphabet in every genome.
[02:05:00.934 --> 02:05:02.055]  They're writing that in.
[02:05:03.095 --> 02:05:04.836]  I mean, that's completely crazy.
[02:05:04.876 --> 02:05:06.136]  You know, words have power.
[02:05:06.416 --> 02:05:08.577]  Putting a brand new alphabet does something to you.
[02:05:08.757 --> 02:05:10.457]  What are these messages they're putting in?
[02:05:11.137 --> 02:05:13.818]  I mean, just know they are doing it to... And again, criminals love to brag.
[02:05:13.838 --> 02:05:16.039]  They're not just putting Trojan horse alphabets in.
[02:05:17.319 --> 02:05:17.899]  Absolutely.
[02:05:18.139 --> 02:05:18.879]  Marking is there.
[02:05:18.939 --> 02:05:20.220]  The whole thing's a Trojan horse.
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:21.820]  Everything they do is evil.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.801]  Look how many people it's already killing.
[02:05:24.221 --> 02:05:29.322]  Because you started off by talking about most, you said a lot of the women you talk to are having menstrual problems.
[02:05:29.522 --> 02:05:30.382]  That's what we're hearing.
[02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:31.383]  People are panicking.
[02:05:32.623 --> 02:05:33.684]  What do you think's going on?
[02:05:35.485 --> 02:05:41.149]  Well, there's something happening because there's too many anecdotal stories, and we call it transmission.
[02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:49.074]  Now, I know many people may not think this could be the case, but I do, because I know about this technology.
[02:05:49.434 --> 02:05:55.638]  When you get the nanotechnology inside of you, you actually automatically start to have a Wi-Fi connection.
[02:05:56.298 --> 02:06:05.884]  Now, it's maybe not that strong, but the more you have, then you can actually act as an antenna, or you can actually put out more frequencies.
[02:06:05.944 --> 02:06:08.106]  I know it sounds crazy, but we can do that.
[02:06:08.126 --> 02:06:09.206]  But that's what they want to do.
[02:06:09.226 --> 02:06:10.027]  Yeah, that's in the literature.
[02:06:11.321 --> 02:06:14.183]  And so I see people get better when they're away from the people.
[02:06:14.223 --> 02:06:19.786]  So if you're actually getting a true virus from them, infection, you'd still be sick when you got home.
[02:06:19.867 --> 02:06:21.928]  No, you're saying the people are transmitting.
[02:06:21.948 --> 02:06:23.129]  It's not just shedding.
[02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.950]  It's not just they're infectious with the virus.
[02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:29.813]  They are actually transmitting now a signal, not just sloughing off RNA.
[02:06:30.885 --> 02:06:35.669]  Yes, yes, that's absolutely 100% doable and that can happen.
[02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:38.913]  So the problem is no one's looking into this.
[02:06:39.013 --> 02:06:40.314]  It's not just a tiny shot.
[02:06:40.414 --> 02:06:43.337]  It makes almost every cell, I guess every cell that divides.
[02:06:43.397 --> 02:06:44.958]  I guess your eye cells don't do that.
[02:06:46.239 --> 02:06:48.020]  It takes them over and makes them make a protein.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:48.860]  So that's powerful.
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.660]  We're electrochemical.
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:51.701]  It's taking over everything in your body.
[02:06:51.721 --> 02:06:52.981]  That's why the hearts are swelling up.
[02:06:53.001 --> 02:06:55.862]  People are having heart attacks because it's causing autoimmune response or other things.
[02:06:55.882 --> 02:06:56.502]  You're the doctor.
[02:06:56.542 --> 02:06:57.002]  You know all this.
[02:06:57.302 --> 02:06:58.463]  We got to get you back on.
[02:06:58.543 --> 02:06:59.483]  This is just crazy.
[02:06:59.663 --> 02:07:02.564]  Because taking over every cell in the body, that's a powerful transmission.
[02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:13.061]  Yeah, they said by 2030 they expect every human on earth to be a cyborg, or at least a hybrid of a cyborg and an organic human being.
[02:07:13.081 --> 02:07:13.902]  That was NBC News.
[02:07:13.942 --> 02:07:16.824]  They said whether you like it or not, humans will be extinct by, I think they said, 2040?
[02:07:19.471 --> 02:07:23.412]  Yeah, and then 2030 when we would be melding together with the cyborgs.
[02:07:23.453 --> 02:07:26.073]  This is their plan, but we do not have to consent to it.
[02:07:26.113 --> 02:07:27.274]  We don't have to go along.
[02:07:27.714 --> 02:07:28.814]  We need to stop it now.
[02:07:29.015 --> 02:07:29.855]  Yeah, they found the article.
[02:07:29.895 --> 02:07:31.035]  Do five more minutes with us, Doc.
[02:07:31.095 --> 02:07:32.036]  It's incredible having you.
[02:07:32.336 --> 02:07:33.316]  And people gotta support her.
[02:07:33.596 --> 02:07:34.637]  She doesn't even have a PayPal.
[02:07:34.657 --> 02:07:35.537]  People need to support her.
[02:07:35.737 --> 02:07:40.419]  You need to go to serendipitygroup.org and check out her findings and the information there.
[02:07:40.459 --> 02:07:42.420]  And she's getting geared up to fight even harder.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:43.300]  Wow, we'll be right back.
[02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:54.891]  All right, Dr. Carrie Madej is our guest, serendipitygroup.org, and she is really getting me fired up with her spirit of resistance, but through a loving energy.
[02:07:54.911 --> 02:07:57.212]  And I feel that energy getting stronger.
[02:07:57.252 --> 02:07:59.014]  I feel humanity really waking up.
[02:07:59.914 --> 02:08:01.955]  Because of the attack we're under.
[02:08:02.415 --> 02:08:04.716]  And I just can't wait to have her back on with us again.
[02:08:04.736 --> 02:08:07.118]  She's been totally vindicated since she was here nine, 10 months ago.
[02:08:07.638 --> 02:08:08.718]  We got a few minutes left.
[02:08:08.958 --> 02:08:09.639]  We ran for that break.
[02:08:09.659 --> 02:08:10.699]  I appreciate you holding over.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:17.362]  What other nuggets of knowledge would you like to put out there in a message to the universe, a message in a bottle to warn people?
[02:08:21.044 --> 02:08:24.466]  I've had a glimpse into the future of us if we do nothing.
[02:08:24.666 --> 02:08:28.768]  If we just accept what is being told to us, we do what they tell us to do.
[02:08:29.702 --> 02:08:34.968]  And I don't have human words to tell you how awful and horrible it will be.
[02:08:36.578 --> 02:08:37.518]  Yes, for our children.
[02:08:37.878 --> 02:08:40.239]  So we have to do something right now.
[02:08:40.319 --> 02:08:41.819]  This is why I spend my time.
[02:08:41.839 --> 02:08:46.041]  I do it for free because what else is there without freedom?
[02:08:46.281 --> 02:08:47.101]  You can't love.
[02:08:47.121 --> 02:08:49.042]  You can't be freedom of thought.
[02:08:49.162 --> 02:08:50.002]  You're not a human.
[02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:52.362]  Do not let this agenda go forward.
[02:08:52.462 --> 02:08:53.543]  Please open your eyes.
[02:08:53.943 --> 02:08:55.623]  It's not just about the United States.
[02:08:55.683 --> 02:08:57.264]  It's not just about this political party.
[02:08:57.704 --> 02:08:59.324]  Around the world this is being mirrored.
[02:08:59.624 --> 02:09:01.005]  Everyone's saying the same thing.
[02:09:01.625 --> 02:09:05.110]  There are other entities or corporations running the show.
[02:09:05.411 --> 02:09:07.333]  In effect, I think a big coup happened.
[02:09:07.353 --> 02:09:08.575]  We didn't even know it happened.
[02:09:09.096 --> 02:09:14.884]  And so are you going to let them get away with their agenda about depopulating many of us and then ultimately controlling us?
[02:09:14.924 --> 02:09:17.167]  Because that's essentially what it is.
[02:09:17.207 --> 02:09:18.188]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:09:18.909 --> 02:09:21.930]  And so I refuse that, and I won't be a part of that.
[02:09:22.151 --> 02:09:27.633]  And I hope to open the eyes of all of you out there and your hearts, because we have the power.
[02:09:27.713 --> 02:09:28.293]  We're over 99%.
[02:09:29.774 --> 02:09:32.575]  We just have to stand up and say, no, it's really that simple.
[02:09:32.735 --> 02:09:33.816]  But we just have to do it.
[02:09:33.836 --> 02:09:40.058]  That's why they're fighting according to race and religion and all this, because behind the scenes, they are bringing in a post-human world.
[02:09:40.138 --> 02:09:41.639]  I mean, we can feel it, we can see it.
[02:09:42.039 --> 02:09:44.380]  And as you said, in their literature, they admit it all.
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:45.701]  I mean, this is nightmarish.
[02:09:47.182 --> 02:09:48.062]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:48.482 --> 02:09:49.522]  But we have the power.
[02:09:49.562 --> 02:09:50.383]  Just remember that.
[02:09:50.923 --> 02:09:52.283]  And we have to remember who we are.
[02:09:52.323 --> 02:09:53.443]  We are eternal souls.
[02:09:53.823 --> 02:09:55.303]  We are made in the likeness of God.
[02:09:55.363 --> 02:10:00.964]  Don't give that up for the idea and the illusion of any safety.
[02:10:01.024 --> 02:10:03.525]  Because the name of their game is panic and fear.
[02:10:04.085 --> 02:10:08.506]  Once you have a little bit of feeling of safety, they'll do something else to give you more panic.
[02:10:08.906 --> 02:10:09.806]  I mean, look what they're doing.
[02:10:09.846 --> 02:10:15.827]  They're always putting something else in the news to make you frightened and to make you not stand up and speak for your rights.
[02:10:16.247 --> 02:10:17.428]  Just know we have a beautiful world.
[02:10:17.448 --> 02:10:18.989]  We've got all the resources we need.
[02:10:19.329 --> 02:10:19.990]  We have enough.
[02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:21.871]  We don't have climate change happening.
[02:10:21.911 --> 02:10:24.213]  We have enough land for everybody to live on.
[02:10:24.233 --> 02:10:29.377]  Look at these Stockholm Syndrome parents taking their children in to be injected with a gene therapy.
[02:10:29.477 --> 02:10:30.518]  I mean, this is pure evil.
[02:10:30.638 --> 02:10:33.420]  And when and if their children get sick or die, they'll say it's worth it.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:35.041]  Like the woman that got paralyzed in Tennessee.
[02:10:35.081 --> 02:10:36.282]  She said, you know, I'll do it again.
[02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:37.102]  It's good.
[02:10:37.142 --> 02:10:37.783]  I want to help people.
[02:10:38.846 --> 02:10:39.368]  Oh my.
[02:10:39.588 --> 02:10:39.869]  No.
[02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:42.414]  Nobody should be experimented on.
[02:10:42.474 --> 02:10:46.703]  That's why the Nuremberg Code was created to stop the atrocities of World War II.
[02:10:47.043 --> 02:10:47.745]  What are we doing?
[02:10:47.785 --> 02:10:50.050]  We're breaking the Nuremberg Code as we speak.
[02:10:51.071 --> 02:10:52.432]  This should never happen.
[02:10:52.473 --> 02:10:54.634]  We need to stop it before it gets any worse.
[02:10:55.115 --> 02:10:58.618]  These aren't for the wellness and the good of humanity.
[02:10:58.658 --> 02:11:03.282]  If you look at all the literature, you see that all of this is built on a web of lies.
[02:11:04.283 --> 02:11:05.404]  We're not being told the truth.
[02:11:05.444 --> 02:11:07.746]  So shut your televisions off with the mainstream media.
[02:11:07.766 --> 02:11:08.967]  They're not telling you the truth.
[02:11:09.307 --> 02:11:10.608]  Start doing your due diligence.
[02:11:10.808 --> 02:11:16.893]  Do the alternative media sources and you'll find that what we're saying has a lot of truth behind it.
[02:11:17.934 --> 02:11:25.778]  I agree, and then share this report on your Twitter, on your Facebook, on your YouTube, and share it on your email, and get it out there, folks.
[02:11:26.198 --> 02:11:27.039]  Show it to your church.
[02:11:27.099 --> 02:11:27.919]  Show it to your neighbors.
[02:11:27.959 --> 02:11:30.240]  This is a war, an information war.
[02:11:30.461 --> 02:11:33.862]  Dr. Carrie Madej, SerendipityGroup.org.
[02:11:34.002 --> 02:11:38.425]  Everyone should share that link, and again, later this afternoon, we'll post this powerful interview.
[02:11:38.705 --> 02:11:40.185]  This deserves to be seen by millions.
[02:11:40.606 --> 02:11:41.366]  We're going to do it.
[02:11:41.386 --> 02:11:41.886]  We're going to win.
[02:11:42.186 --> 02:11:43.727]  Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:11:43.747 --> 02:11:45.328]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:11:45.348 --> 02:11:46.248]  It's been my pleasure.
[02:11:48.638 --> 02:11:50.319]  Man, her spirit makes me feel strong.
[02:11:50.839 --> 02:11:53.820]  And talking to all the listeners and all the other guests we have makes me feel strong.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:57.081]  And seeing this great crew that fights so hard makes me know we're going to win.
[02:11:57.101 --> 02:11:58.201]  Because I get pissed.
[02:11:58.281 --> 02:11:59.402]  I mean, I know this is all real.
[02:12:00.302 --> 02:12:01.983]  I know she's not lying about them trying to recruit her.
[02:12:02.003 --> 02:12:02.803]  They tried to recruit my dad.
[02:12:03.763 --> 02:12:04.924]  I know a lot of people did get recruited.
[02:12:05.725 --> 02:12:07.687]  Hell, I've had people on, the hell they tried to get me to join them.
[02:12:07.748 --> 02:12:09.751]  I've got witnesses of that, the Kissinger group.
[02:12:10.732 --> 02:12:12.194]  But I mean, my soul's not for sale.
[02:12:12.214 --> 02:12:14.918]  And I've been around these Globalist men, they are so unhappy.
[02:12:15.539 --> 02:12:16.100]  They're slaves.
[02:12:16.701 --> 02:12:17.582]  They're not in charge.
[02:12:17.683 --> 02:12:20.266]  You don't run this thing, you join it and become a slave of Satan.
[02:12:20.507 --> 02:12:20.968]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:22.162 --> 02:12:28.386]  Well, I learned about Dr. Rosa from his show, because I watch it on his own show that's on iHeartRadio, Stu Peters.
[02:12:28.986 --> 02:12:38.792]  He's a recently quasi-retired bounty hunter, really smart guy, redvoicemedia.com, and he hosts, when he can, Friday's 4th Hour Ahead of the War with Owen Schroyer.
[02:12:40.126 --> 02:12:45.631]  And I just wanted to overall get his view before he takes over with all the big guests and information he has today.
[02:12:46.091 --> 02:12:52.396]  I saw him, he's doing a great job, and it just excites me to learn about him six months ago and learn about all these other great people.
[02:12:53.076 --> 02:13:02.224]  I'm really seeing this attempted globalist takeover firing on so many fronts, get people up off their ass, and really energize humanity to resist this.
[02:13:03.985 --> 02:13:07.527]  We also have election panic coming in 2022.
[02:13:08.147 --> 02:13:13.629]  And I'm going to go ahead and be on the war room for the first 30 minutes with Owen covering this, because this is probably the most important thing.
[02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:15.910]  I didn't get to it today yet, but I wanted to ask you about it.
[02:13:16.410 --> 02:13:28.996]  You've got a lot of these top political scientists that have predicted the last seven elections and more coming out saying if 74% of Republicans think they stole the election, 30% of Democrats, the numbers are rising.
[02:13:30.097 --> 02:13:44.728]  This will cause a legendary crisis in the next election, and that's why Homeland Security is announcing, quote, anybody that's pro-America is a white supremacist, and a white supremacist is a terrorist, so now all the anti-terrorism laws that waive the Constitution can be used on us.
[02:13:46.009 --> 02:13:47.570]  This is just incredible.
[02:13:48.902 --> 02:13:50.923]  But so it's clear the globalists have hijacked the country.
[02:13:50.983 --> 02:13:54.544]  It's clear they know that we know they stole the election.
[02:13:55.605 --> 02:14:06.529]  And when we're faced with a criminal assault like this, with martial law, with their COVID lockdowns, and the race war they're going to try to trigger, as the cover for inflation, food prices going up 76%, the Bloomberg
[02:14:08.710 --> 02:14:10.671]  Agro spot index is always dead on.
[02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:14.532]  Current food buying worldwide is up 76%.
[02:14:15.133 --> 02:14:25.737]  You add all of these factors together, they're going to try to cover up a world depression, a financial collapse, by these big banks that created more stuff than Madoff could imagine, with race war.
[02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:30.058]  And anybody that's against destroying the country and having Marxism is going to be called a Nazi and rounded up.
[02:14:30.338 --> 02:14:33.440]  That's going to trigger a giant civil war, which makes China even happier.
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:35.821]  A. Do you agree with that analysis?
[02:14:36.222 --> 02:14:37.463]  And then B. I'm going to let you take over.
[02:14:37.483 --> 02:14:38.043]  I'll be listening.
[02:14:40.325 --> 02:14:41.626]  How do we counter that?
[02:14:42.287 --> 02:14:50.434]  Because obviously physical is the way to get into the fight they want when we intellectually are exposing that they're the bad guys and that all Americans are in this together.
[02:14:50.634 --> 02:14:53.676]  And they're using the same divide and conquer around the world.
[02:14:54.077 --> 02:14:56.519]  So that's a that's a mouthful, sir.
[02:14:56.779 --> 02:14:58.661]  But give me give me your take on that.
[02:14:58.681 --> 02:15:00.002]  And I'm going to turn this over to you.
[02:15:00.851 --> 02:15:06.541]  Well, you're not the only guy that's on the screen that is labeled a conspiracy theorist or a racist or a bigot.
[02:15:07.393 --> 02:15:16.217]  Uh, and you mentioned, you know, people rising up and, and getting out of other fields, coming into this, speaking out, getting, getting part of the, being part of the fight, part of the active resistance.
[02:15:16.797 --> 02:15:17.677]  And that's what's happening.
[02:15:17.757 --> 02:15:22.199]  And the scariest part about what you're mentioning is that they're doing it all right out in front of us.
[02:15:22.979 --> 02:15:27.581]  Uh, I mean, look at this, the CEO of YouTube, uh, gets the freedom of speech award.
[02:15:27.801 --> 02:15:29.862]  And I don't know if you saw any of that, but that was laughable.
[02:15:29.902 --> 02:15:31.943]  I mean, this dystopian- From her own company!
[02:15:32.003 --> 02:15:34.884]  Her own company gave her the award for defending free speech!
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:51.236]  Yeah, and this disconnected, out-of-touch, elitist, narcissistic way of thinking, this idea that you and I are just going to digest this information, take these people seriously, it's kind of humorous on its face, but when you think a little deeper,
[02:15:51.989 --> 02:15:54.571]  That's the most, I don't want to say scary, because I'm not a scared person.
[02:15:54.611 --> 02:15:57.012]  I think nervousness might give you an edge, but I'm never scared.
[02:15:57.252 --> 02:15:58.113]  But how about this?
[02:15:58.153 --> 02:16:02.055]  It's the most alarming part of this whole thing, this whole PSYOP.
[02:16:02.255 --> 02:16:04.977]  Let's just say you got your hackles up, you're ready for war.
[02:16:05.057 --> 02:16:06.878]  Your spidey sense is on high.
[02:16:06.898 --> 02:16:10.160]  To use the Hobbit analogy, the sword's sting is glowing white-blue.
[02:16:10.993 --> 02:16:12.094]  Yeah, and they're doing it right.
[02:16:12.174 --> 02:16:17.300]  It's like looking a criminal in the face where you know that you've been vindicated because you know who they are.
[02:16:18.061 --> 02:16:19.062]  You know why they've done it.
[02:16:19.282 --> 02:16:25.569]  I talked a couple of weeks ago on your program about, you know, the proverbial, the analogy of being a kidnapping victim.
[02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:27.671]  We're all kind of the victims of this kidnapping.
[02:16:27.712 --> 02:16:29.794]  And imagine being on the street in front of the bank.
[02:16:30.772 --> 02:16:34.013]  Maybe getting some fresh air while your buddy is running into the store.
[02:16:34.053 --> 02:16:36.914]  Your girlfriend maybe went in to grab some ice cream.
[02:16:36.994 --> 02:16:37.294]  I don't know.
[02:16:37.314 --> 02:16:38.254]  You're having a cigarette.
[02:16:38.294 --> 02:16:38.795]  Whatever it is.
[02:16:38.835 --> 02:16:39.575]  It's a nice day.
[02:16:39.875 --> 02:16:41.295]  Just put yourself there for a second.
[02:16:41.615 --> 02:16:44.096]  And you look down the sidewalk, and there's your buddy.
[02:16:44.896 --> 02:16:47.937]  And he's getting out of his vehicle, and you kind of wave at him or whatever a little bit.
[02:16:47.957 --> 02:16:53.079]  You acknowledge him, and he's throwing on a ski mask, grabbing a gun, and getting ready to go into that bank.
[02:16:53.159 --> 02:16:54.039]  And he looks at you.
[02:16:54.579 --> 02:16:55.320]  He sees you.
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.600]  He sees that you see him.
[02:16:57.518 --> 02:17:05.167]  You know that he sees you, he knows that you can identify him, and he knows that you know why he's going into that bank with that gun after covering his face, but he does it anyways.
[02:17:05.768 --> 02:17:09.032]  He does it right in front of you, knowing that you could out him.
[02:17:10.071 --> 02:17:12.233]  But he just doesn't care and he commits the crime.
[02:17:12.273 --> 02:17:12.774]  Exactly!
[02:17:12.874 --> 02:17:16.277]  Why is Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab, why are they doing it?
[02:17:16.297 --> 02:17:17.398]  I mean, exactly!
[02:17:17.578 --> 02:17:22.843]  They're just committing mass crime, mass genetic engineering, mass death already starting like we knew they would.
[02:17:23.064 --> 02:17:26.867]  They did secret animal trials, all the animals died with what they're giving people now.
[02:17:26.887 --> 02:17:27.548]  I mean, whoa!
[02:17:29.079 --> 02:17:32.403]  Yeah, so now your buddy goes into the bank and he's taking hostages.
[02:17:33.043 --> 02:17:35.266]  Or even worse, he's killing somebody, right?
[02:17:35.586 --> 02:17:37.348]  And that's the Bill Gates.
[02:17:37.588 --> 02:17:38.449]  That's these globalists.
[02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:45.477]  Somebody loses their life as a result of these criminal actions, or maybe what's even more scary is as a result of your inaction.
[02:17:46.152 --> 02:17:47.373]  And that is why I'm here.
[02:17:47.453 --> 02:17:48.614]  I know that's why you're here.
[02:17:48.954 --> 02:17:51.155]  And that's why you're seeing a lot of these people become inspired.
[02:17:51.175 --> 02:17:53.396]  That's why you're seeing a lot of these doctors that are fighting back.
[02:17:53.436 --> 02:17:55.097]  That's why you see people like Bobby Pyton.
[02:17:55.117 --> 02:17:56.458]  He's completely giving up a career.
[02:17:56.518 --> 02:18:07.325]  He's down and overseeing this whole audit that's happening in Arizona right now, which, by the way, completely covered up by the mainstream media, by the same people who are giving themselves the Freedom of Speech Awards.
[02:18:07.705 --> 02:18:09.046]  And that's how they're doing us right now.
[02:18:09.086 --> 02:18:10.967]  These criminals are out here robbing our banks.
[02:18:12.188 --> 02:18:13.689]  Toppling our political system.
[02:18:13.729 --> 02:18:14.710]  Stealing our votes.
[02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:17.032]  Holding our families hostage.
[02:18:17.752 --> 02:18:18.753]  Threatening our jobs.
[02:18:18.873 --> 02:18:19.574]  Canceling us.
[02:18:19.654 --> 02:18:20.234]  Doxing us.
[02:18:20.294 --> 02:18:21.455]  Restricting our travel.
[02:18:21.495 --> 02:18:24.558]  You saw Nick Fuentes is now on a no-fly list.
[02:18:25.118 --> 02:18:26.059]  They're arresting us.
[02:18:26.099 --> 02:18:26.880]  They're jailing us.
[02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:27.941]  They're prosecuting us.
[02:18:28.301 --> 02:18:39.711]  They're labeling us crazy, involuntary... And they said they're going to use the CIA and Pentagon because white supremacists are the main threat and then they define white supremacists as Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump.
[02:18:40.595 --> 02:18:45.756]  Yeah, forcing us to inject ourselves with an unknown and unproven cocktail.
[02:18:45.796 --> 02:18:47.896]  This is breaking today at redvoicemedia.com.
[02:18:47.936 --> 02:18:50.697]  Alex, I just got off the phone with Dr. Jane Ruby.
[02:18:51.037 --> 02:18:52.337]  I know that you just had the doctor on.
[02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:53.737]  You guys were talking vaccinations.
[02:18:54.057 --> 02:18:56.618]  I jotted down the words that she said there towards the end of your talk.
[02:18:56.638 --> 02:19:03.499]  She said, quote, I don't even have human words to describe the future for us and for our kids if we don't do anything.
[02:19:04.159 --> 02:19:05.960]  I mean, don't think about that, Alex.
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:08.460]  This is an educated doctor
[02:19:09.344 --> 02:19:12.308]  Who knows what the future looks like if we don't do anything?
[02:19:12.348 --> 02:19:16.173]  And she's saying, I don't even have human words to describe it.
[02:19:17.895 --> 02:19:18.656]  It's horrific.
[02:19:19.397 --> 02:19:21.479]  We have reached the line in the sand here.
[02:19:23.141 --> 02:19:23.722]  Absolutely.
[02:19:24.082 --> 02:19:24.663]  We'll take over.
[02:19:24.683 --> 02:19:25.664]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:19:25.744 --> 02:19:26.565]  I agree with you.
[02:19:27.006 --> 02:19:27.687]  Please take over, brother.
[02:19:28.502 --> 02:19:29.102]  Okay, for sure.
[02:19:29.703 --> 02:19:31.883]  And breaking at redvoicemedia.com right now, you can check it out.
[02:19:31.903 --> 02:19:32.944]  By the way, my name is Stu Peters.
[02:19:32.984 --> 02:19:39.847]  Alex, thank you for graciously having me here, by the way, every single Friday afternoon to finish out the work week here with you on the Alex Jones Show, Bannedness.TV.
[02:19:39.887 --> 02:19:52.472]  But in talking to Dr. Jane Ruby, and I'm going to get to Bobby Pyton here in just a second because he's doing really important work down in Arizona overseeing and kind of, he's kind of the charge behind this whole audit that's happening in Arizona that's happening very quietly.
[02:19:52.512 --> 02:19:53.773]  The only way that you would know about it
[02:19:54.253 --> 02:19:58.878]  You know, as if you're in the dark web, I guess, or if you happen to know certain people who know certain things.
[02:19:58.918 --> 02:20:03.242]  But Dr. Ruby was telling me that there's this thing called, what is it called here?
[02:20:04.723 --> 02:20:07.926]  It's this transmission with the vaccine.
[02:20:07.987 --> 02:20:09.848]  So in other words, it's called shedding.
[02:20:09.928 --> 02:20:10.389]  That's what it is.
[02:20:10.409 --> 02:20:10.709]  Thank you.
[02:20:11.049 --> 02:20:11.850]  It's called shedding.
[02:20:12.691 --> 02:20:18.477]  So if you haven't had, and I don't know if you've talked about this because I've kind of been busy all day, so forgive me if I'm being redundant or repetitive here, but
[02:20:19.197 --> 02:20:48.216]  If I have had the vaccine and you haven't, and you have chosen not to get the vaccine because you have done some research and you find that there's some negative health implications, you're paying attention to the 60,000 plus blood clot cases, these healthy people dying, people keeling over dead, abortions happening, involuntarily of course, to the tune of 30,000 miscarriages in one month after expected mothers had been vaccinated, and you're seeing all this happen, so you've elected not to get the vaccination,
[02:20:49.398 --> 02:20:54.400]  If you're near me, a vaccinated person, you can essentially take on the vaccine.
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:58.402]  You can essentially... I will shed this vaccine into you.
[02:20:58.462 --> 02:21:01.023]  You will experience the same side effects that I have.
[02:21:01.943 --> 02:21:06.305]  And there are many, many reports of this actually happening right now.
[02:21:07.126 --> 02:21:07.826]  There it is right there.
[02:21:07.846 --> 02:21:09.247]  Okay, so you have been talking about this.
[02:21:10.147 --> 02:21:12.128]  And these things are being made to spread.
[02:21:12.648 --> 02:21:14.729]  And so, with the doctor saying that
[02:21:15.399 --> 02:21:27.325]  Look, I mean, this was obviously intentional in that there was a planned release of this virus by, ooh, maybe the top investor in an obscure Wuhan lab in China, Anthony Fauci?
[02:21:28.143 --> 02:21:29.524]  You have to follow the money trail.
[02:21:29.564 --> 02:21:33.965]  You have to look at who has what to gain, and there's a lot of that coming up.
[02:21:33.985 --> 02:21:39.187]  I'm going to be talking to a lady today, bringing her to you, a 49-year-old Columbia college grad.
[02:21:39.207 --> 02:21:41.929]  You'll never believe the way the system has been weaponized against her.
[02:21:42.009 --> 02:21:43.389]  She's been kidnapped.
[02:21:43.409 --> 02:21:44.750]  She's been falsely imprisoned.
[02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:46.690]  She's been involuntarily committed.
[02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:48.151]  She's been force-medicated.
[02:21:48.231 --> 02:21:50.112]  Coming up in just a few minutes, I'll have Bobby Pyton.
[02:21:50.652 --> 02:21:59.813]  He would introduce himself as a God-loving American that cares deeply about our Republic, and after having several recent conversations with him, I agree he's leading all the charge in that audit down in Arizona.
[02:21:59.833 --> 02:22:00.395]  We'll be right back.
[02:22:01.109 --> 02:22:02.790]  Yeah, there it is on the right side over there.
[02:22:02.850 --> 02:22:07.714]  Medical experts, something is being transmitted from vaccinated people to unvaccinated people.
[02:22:07.754 --> 02:22:10.297]  That's Dr. Gene Ruby at redvoicemedia.com.
[02:22:10.357 --> 02:22:12.378]  If you have time, make sure that you check that out.
[02:22:12.398 --> 02:22:15.641]  It's about 27 minutes of really, really great information.
[02:22:15.661 --> 02:22:19.244]  This guy that I'm going to talk to here, he's a really humble guy.
[02:22:19.284 --> 02:22:21.846]  I've had a lot of recent conversation with him.
[02:22:23.187 --> 02:22:25.429]  He feels the same way that I do about our Republic.
[02:22:25.469 --> 02:22:27.270]  He loves our Republic.
[02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:28.051]  He loves freedom.
[02:22:28.091 --> 02:22:28.772]  He loves God.
[02:22:29.652 --> 02:22:31.994]  And I believe every word of what he's saying.
[02:22:32.034 --> 02:22:34.335]  He's right in the middle of this audit down in Arizona.
[02:22:34.415 --> 02:22:36.016]  And the thing is a big damn deal.
[02:22:36.036 --> 02:22:43.921]  That Arizona audit means the world of difference for the November election from last year and for the future of our country.
[02:22:44.581 --> 02:22:45.902]  Well, I mean, what's really going on is an all-out
[02:23:07.902 --> 02:23:08.262]  I don't
[02:23:27.618 --> 02:23:35.102]  And this canvassing effort is a really big part of proving out what I've been saying back in December.
[02:23:35.742 --> 02:23:51.469]  I guess I mentioned it in November, I really more thoroughly explained it in December, and recently I've just talked about how there's real people that are registered to vote, they're real Americans, that did not vote
[02:23:52.364 --> 02:23:55.926]  But somehow their vote showed up anyways.
[02:23:56.547 --> 02:23:58.268]  And so that's what's going on.
[02:23:58.328 --> 02:24:04.312]  I mean, I just heard today they're going to try to put a carnival next to the facility.
[02:24:04.652 --> 02:24:07.134]  So they're doing everything they can to slow this down.
[02:24:07.494 --> 02:24:12.337]  But once the truth is exposed, I do think it is going to be a permanent game changer.
[02:24:13.331 --> 02:24:28.403]  Now, no matter what you say, no matter what your political alignment is, no matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative, whether you're a black guy or a white gal, or if you're gay, straight, Christian, Muslim, whatever it is, you should want a fair election.
[02:24:28.963 --> 02:24:36.029]  And you and I have talked, Bobby, if Joe Biden won the election fair and square, there should be no hesitation at all.
[02:24:36.741 --> 02:24:46.830]  From any political party or caucus, from any group of people to check into this process, to validate these votes, to validate these ballots, to do this canvas.
[02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:48.632]  I mean, basically this is a simple math thing.
[02:24:48.712 --> 02:24:49.813]  Raise your hands if you voted.
[02:24:50.634 --> 02:24:56.840]  When you have such a huge discrepancy in numbers, talking 600,000 plus, that is a big deal.
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:00.283]  So tell us about these phantom voters that you were alluding to.
[02:25:01.747 --> 02:25:07.974]  Well, see, there's a there's a couple of ways that I think these phantom voters could be quickly explained to the American public.
[02:25:08.414 --> 02:25:12.719]  And I think I mentioned it briefly, maybe last time we spoke.
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:20.568]  And I know I mentioned it on a couple other things recently, which is I call it the family reunion project.
[02:25:21.068 --> 02:25:32.535]  If every American, especially in Arizona, so in Maricopa County, somebody asked me a question, Bobby, what should the citizens of Maricopa do to help in this process if they're concerned about fair elections?
[02:25:33.035 --> 02:25:36.677]  And I said, well, here's what they should consider doing.
[02:25:37.137 --> 02:25:47.604]  And then people across America should also consider doing this if they want to get to the bottom of this phantom voter thing that is being, you know, I'm being portrayed as though I'm making it up.
[02:25:48.164 --> 02:25:49.885]  So here's the simple solution.
[02:25:50.445 --> 02:25:55.366]  Take out a piece of paper, write down all your family members that live in your state.
[02:25:56.387 --> 02:26:02.268]  All your uncles, your cousins, your brothers, sisters, your parents, your grandparents.
[02:26:02.288 --> 02:26:05.369]  Write them all out and then maybe put it into Excel or something.
[02:26:05.809 --> 02:26:09.170]  Find out, you know, when their birthday is, their mailing address.
[02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:10.810]  All that jazz.
[02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:13.251]  It's a good time to reconnect with your family.
[02:26:13.311 --> 02:26:13.871]  Call them up.
[02:26:14.351 --> 02:26:16.892]  Say, hey, how many people are living in that house?
[02:26:16.972 --> 02:26:18.733]  Are you registered to vote, by the way, sis?
[02:26:18.853 --> 02:26:20.473]  I don't need to know who you're voting for.
[02:26:21.053 --> 02:26:23.414]  Can you please just tell me if you're registered to vote?
[02:26:23.974 --> 02:26:27.715]  And then do you mind asking your husband if they're registered to vote?
[02:26:27.735 --> 02:26:31.396]  Do you mind asking your 18-year-old child if they're registered to vote?
[02:26:31.756 --> 02:26:33.937]  And where are they registered to vote?
[02:26:34.077 --> 02:26:37.198]  If each American just did that little bit of citizenship,
[02:26:38.055 --> 02:26:58.454]  And then they had that list of all the people that were registered to vote and then go and maybe you can have a group party, have a little family get together with the reunion and you turn around and pull, you know, pull the information up from the voter rolls for the state or for your area, right?
[02:26:58.574 --> 02:26:59.595]  Ideally for the state.
[02:27:00.423 --> 02:27:14.390]  That you live in and ultimately we would like to look at this nationwide but let's just say you look at the state of Arizona and you live in Maricopa and go look at how many other family members that you all have that you just never knew you had!
[02:27:15.773 --> 02:27:28.475]  And you'll be shocked to uncover that there's a bunch of, there might be a couple, two or three of you, there might be a couple of Stu Peters in different parts of your state that are a couple, a couple of them are a little younger than you.
[02:27:28.495 --> 02:27:30.596]  A couple of them are a little bit older than you.
[02:27:30.996 --> 02:27:33.236]  And you might be asking, Bobby, why are they doing this?
[02:27:33.576 --> 02:27:39.978]  Well, because when people are checking the actual voting records and then they're like, hey, Bobby, you said Stu is fake.
[02:27:40.118 --> 02:27:40.998]  What are you talking about?
[02:27:41.058 --> 02:27:42.158]  Stu is a real person.
[02:27:42.930 --> 02:27:45.331]  And then you, you know, I look like I'm nuts, right?
[02:27:45.751 --> 02:27:48.212]  But it's like, hey, Stu, are you three people?
[02:27:48.232 --> 02:27:50.333]  Did you did they make a gremlin out of you?
[02:27:50.373 --> 02:27:51.913]  Did they put some water on you in the middle?
[02:27:52.273 --> 02:27:56.715]  You know, like right after midnight, or it was Oh, I'm sorry, you got to feed them after midnight to turn into a gremlin.
[02:27:56.975 --> 02:28:02.077]  But if you put the drops of water other little gremlins form, and and this is what they've done.
[02:28:02.777 --> 02:28:03.018]  Okay.
[02:28:03.038 --> 02:28:03.198]  Okay.
[02:28:17.395 --> 02:28:23.701]  So to everybody that's saying, and I want you to get to that, because how they're covering up their crime is incredibly important information that I want you to have.
[02:28:23.741 --> 02:28:25.242]  And don't feel rushed, I'll hold you over here.
[02:28:25.903 --> 02:28:32.810]  But what I want to ask you is, is there clear and indisputable evidence you have found that this is actually happening?
[02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.890]  Why?
[02:28:35.496 --> 02:28:37.098]  Why was this thing certified?
[02:28:37.198 --> 02:28:49.474]  Why is everybody standing up here saying what we need to do in 2022 or who we should be electing or who we should be propelling as candidates and who we should be talking about for 2024 when we haven't got 2020 right?
[02:28:49.514 --> 02:28:50.375]  Is this, in about a minute,
[02:28:53.712 --> 02:28:55.673]  And then we'll come back on how they're getting away with it.
[02:28:56.033 --> 02:29:03.617]  But is this going to come to fruition to where we can stop this and say, no, no, no, this guy didn't win legitimately.
[02:29:04.097 --> 02:29:11.581]  All of these candidates from school boards, all the way through the state governments, through your county governments, all the way up to the President of the United States, Joe Biden's not there legitimately.
[02:29:11.621 --> 02:29:12.582]  Can he then be removed?
[02:29:14.485 --> 02:29:24.390]  Well, number one, I think that there is some supposedly there is some some arcane law in the books that could call for a new election.
[02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:35.195]  So I do believe that that law might be triggered if if Arizona flips, which I do believe that it will flip and and then other states follow suit and do these audits.
[02:29:35.675 --> 02:29:37.096]  So that's that's the first part.
[02:29:37.256 --> 02:29:39.777]  You know, I guess that's the second half of your question that you asked.
[02:29:40.317 --> 02:29:46.125]  And then with regards to how sure am I that this is happening?
[02:29:46.326 --> 02:29:47.587]  What's the data showing me?
[02:29:48.088 --> 02:29:50.732]  Am I finding this structurally?
[02:29:51.172 --> 02:29:55.498]  And I guess my answer is yes, I'm finding that this is structurally taking place.
[02:29:56.159 --> 02:30:01.880]  I've mentioned this before and they say, well, Bobby's just focusing on, you know, the voter registration rolls.
[02:30:01.980 --> 02:30:15.143]  And, you know, even though in Arizona, more people are registered to vote since the 2000 election than actually, you know, the number of people that came into the state that are over the age of 18 since 2000.
[02:30:15.203 --> 02:30:17.264]  But that's because we didn't...
[02:30:19.184 --> 02:30:25.169]  We're finding more information about the methods that they used to steal this thing, not Russia, not necessarily China.
[02:30:25.949 --> 02:30:34.636]  This evidence is going to prove whether or not America is still a free republic that still sends representatives to positions of power based on the will of the people.
[02:30:34.656 --> 02:30:36.598]  We're going to find out more about those crimes when we come back.
[02:30:36.778 --> 02:30:38.039]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:30:38.139 --> 02:30:40.300]  Stu Peters here with RedVoiceMedia.com.
[02:30:41.321 --> 02:30:45.163]  We want to make sure that we're sending our representatives to office as we elect them.
[02:30:45.203 --> 02:30:52.707]  I mean, whether or not your vote counts has been a pivotal topic of conversation amongst literally every pundit, whether they're real or fake news.
[02:30:52.787 --> 02:30:57.010]  Everybody's been talking about this election since, I mean, for years now.
[02:30:57.230 --> 02:31:01.312]  Leading up to it, we knew that it was going to be rigged, that the president told us that it was going to be rigged.
[02:31:01.332 --> 02:31:08.756]  And there's a clear opposition to this transparent process and a real fight happening with an opposition that's willing to tear the whole country apart.
[02:31:09.571 --> 02:31:19.096]  Rather than allowing for audits to happen, judges recusing themselves, riots in the streets, framing political adversaries, jailing and prosecuting supporters of the opposing candidate.
[02:31:19.116 --> 02:31:20.897]  We saw Rudy Giuliani's place get raided.
[02:31:20.917 --> 02:31:24.458]  A real cover-up by the state-controlled communist fake news media.
[02:31:24.478 --> 02:31:26.299]  Bobby Pyton is joining us here to talk about it.
[02:31:26.959 --> 02:31:30.561]  Before we went to break, he was saying that he knows how they're getting away with it.
[02:31:30.641 --> 02:31:32.882]  And I want to know, how are they getting away with it?
[02:31:32.902 --> 02:31:34.183]  And then I've got a two-part question.
[02:31:35.781 --> 02:31:39.364]  Well, I could tell you one of the ways they're getting away with a specific example.
[02:31:39.424 --> 02:31:39.924]  How's that?
[02:31:40.044 --> 02:31:43.067]  For people to look into for themselves based on the data.
[02:31:43.547 --> 02:31:46.790]  So we've heard a lot about these dead voters voting, right?
[02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:50.233]  All of us across the country have heard about dead voters voting.
[02:31:50.653 --> 02:31:54.256]  So this is the way anybody can go and prove this in any state.
[02:31:54.497 --> 02:31:54.777]  Okay?
[02:31:55.950 --> 02:32:00.352]  Get a list of all the coroners in your state and each of the counties.
[02:32:00.952 --> 02:32:09.516]  Then get a list of all of the clerks, the county clerks, and find out how long each have been in power, like when they were put into office.
[02:32:10.217 --> 02:32:12.178]  And then I want you to imagine this, Stu.
[02:32:12.918 --> 02:32:20.181]  Let's just assume for a second that you're the county clerk and I'm the coroner of a corrupt county.
[02:32:20.622 --> 02:32:23.403]  And I call you up and I say, hey, Stu,
[02:32:24.289 --> 02:32:27.695]  I've got a hundred people that died in the past two months.
[02:32:28.756 --> 02:32:33.685]  And there's an election coming up and I want, I want to know if you need those votes.
[02:32:34.557 --> 02:32:37.938]  And then you're like, well, go ahead, Bobby, tell me what you want.
[02:32:38.398 --> 02:32:39.879]  They say, well, here's what we're going to do.
[02:32:40.459 --> 02:32:45.780]  The state laws don't make it necessary for me to report on those deaths right away.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:49.821]  So what I'll do is I'll hold off on reporting them to the state.
[02:32:50.982 --> 02:33:01.205]  When people check to see if those people are voting that have already died, when they go into the service to look at them, they'll look as though they're there.
[02:33:01.485 --> 02:33:02.425]  They're not dead yet.
[02:33:02.925 --> 02:33:08.109]  But then when I update the state records, I have to update it based on the death certificate.
[02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:10.911]  So that's why it looks like a dead person voted.
[02:33:11.392 --> 02:33:12.953]  Okay, but here's the other thing.
[02:33:13.253 --> 02:33:15.114]  What we can do is maybe we can make some money.
[02:33:15.595 --> 02:33:18.397]  We can sell this information to organize crime.
[02:33:19.272 --> 02:33:20.493]  And then those people are dead.
[02:33:20.913 --> 02:33:29.478]  So for the next three, four months before we report all this, we can turn around and maybe set up some fake bank accounts, you know, lines of credit.
[02:33:29.538 --> 02:33:32.540]  This person is still in the system as alive.
[02:33:33.001 --> 02:33:36.563]  So we can we can steal possibly billions of dollars doing this.
[02:33:37.223 --> 02:33:47.034]  Okay, now I just heard that in some states there's been as many as 20,000 dead people that supposedly voted that are being purged three, four days later.
[02:33:47.054 --> 02:33:48.275]  I don't know if it's true.
[02:33:48.435 --> 02:33:51.859]  I haven't looked at the data myself, but it jives with what I'm saying.
[02:33:52.399 --> 02:33:58.202]  How many COVID checks were received by dead people, possibly, or other type of money?
[02:33:58.923 --> 02:34:04.286]  So this whole voter thing with these phantom voters, it's not just about stealing our votes, folks.
[02:34:04.706 --> 02:34:07.908]  It's about committing a massive fraud against our federal government.
[02:34:08.428 --> 02:34:11.309]  And I got news for you, it's happening everywhere.
[02:34:11.409 --> 02:34:13.310]  It's not just Arizona, it's happening everywhere.
[02:34:13.570 --> 02:34:23.073]  So that's just one example of how anybody could prove me just totally off my rocker, never put this Bobby guy on the air again, he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.
[02:34:23.553 --> 02:34:32.016]  Go to the coroner's records, find out who the coroner's were, find out when all the reports of the dead people were filed, how many days after they died.
[02:34:32.476 --> 02:34:35.917]  And for anybody who lost somebody in a suspect county that someone died,
[02:34:36.357 --> 02:34:38.639]  Find out when they reported it to the state.
[02:34:39.079 --> 02:34:41.622]  Every American should get involved and do this.
[02:34:42.782 --> 02:34:43.043]  Wow.
[02:34:43.903 --> 02:34:45.425]  Absolutely unbelievable stuff.
[02:34:46.145 --> 02:34:47.486]  And thank you so much.
[02:34:48.307 --> 02:34:50.509]  I mean, it's simple math, Bobby.
[02:34:50.529 --> 02:34:57.635]  And so many people, I think that the big question, and you can answer this, because this is where I was going next.
[02:34:58.356 --> 02:35:00.257]  I was reading in your telegram a little bit of cheating.
[02:35:00.457 --> 02:35:03.400]  So I know what you're going to say, but everybody needs to hear this.
[02:35:04.582 --> 02:35:07.103]  Everybody's question is, okay, I know it was stolen.
[02:35:08.383 --> 02:35:09.484]  The evidence is out here.
[02:35:09.864 --> 02:35:11.044]  There are the evidence deniers.
[02:35:11.284 --> 02:35:11.884]  They're whack jobs.
[02:35:11.904 --> 02:35:12.465]  They're lost.
[02:35:13.005 --> 02:35:13.785]  We're not talking to them.
[02:35:14.425 --> 02:35:15.206]  What can I do?
[02:35:15.666 --> 02:35:17.066]  What can I do about it, Bobby?
[02:35:20.267 --> 02:35:22.368]  Well, what you can do about it
[02:35:23.212 --> 02:35:29.980]  Is you can you can get involved by doing some of the things I mentioned with regards to your family.
[02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:37.809]  Get your find out how many people are registered to vote in your respective state that are with your family.
[02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:41.351]  Find out how many in each household of your family.
[02:35:42.652 --> 02:35:50.356]  And then look at the voter rolls across the state and call other family members and say, hey, this is Stu Peters.
[02:35:50.416 --> 02:35:54.399]  I see that your last name is Peters and your name happens to be Stu too.
[02:35:54.959 --> 02:35:55.820]  Who are your parents?
[02:35:57.020 --> 02:36:06.143]  There are 80,000 Arizonans, and I'm quoting Bobby Pyton in his telegram, there are 80,000 Arizonans for each of the 90 members of House and Senate in Arizona.
[02:36:06.744 --> 02:36:13.946]  If Arizona does not receive the justice it deserves, then the people of Arizona should call for their own shutdown of Arizona.
[02:36:14.486 --> 02:36:30.559]  If politicians had no problem shutting down your economy for COVID, which destroyed countless small businesses and lives, and looked the other way when groups looted cities across our nation, then the American people should have no problem standing up against the political viruses that have affected our nation.
[02:36:30.599 --> 02:36:32.880]  That is specifically what I was talking about.
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:36.043]  That is specifically the call that I think that people need to hear.
[02:36:36.623 --> 02:36:44.589]  And everybody who's listening to this needs to understand the government is not the one that, they're not the only, we have proven that we outnumber these people.
[02:36:44.649 --> 02:36:48.231]  We have proven when we want to do something, what we are capable of doing.
[02:36:48.592 --> 02:36:50.333]  We're proving, we've proven it economically.
[02:36:50.353 --> 02:36:52.194]  Look what happened with the GameStop debacle.
[02:36:52.554 --> 02:36:54.596]  We have proven it time and time again.
[02:36:54.936 --> 02:37:01.120]  We also have proven that if Donald Trump really wanted a violent insurrection, that there are 300 plus million guns in this country.
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:04.903]  And if he had really called for a violent insurrection, it would have been happened.
[02:37:05.683 --> 02:37:09.708]  Uh, so that's what I mean is when somebody's saying, what can I do?
[02:37:10.809 --> 02:37:12.831]  Those are the grassroots that I'm talking about.
[02:37:13.632 --> 02:37:13.933]  Okay.
[02:37:13.953 --> 02:37:18.358]  So what we, what we need to do is, first of all, we are being censored everywhere.
[02:37:19.108 --> 02:37:27.111]  So we need to start just meeting up and exercising our right of assembly, our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion.
[02:37:27.451 --> 02:37:30.252]  We should just start each time we assemble with a small prayer.
[02:37:30.833 --> 02:37:31.873]  We say a few words.
[02:37:32.013 --> 02:37:36.575]  Thank God for all the good fortune that we've experienced.
[02:37:37.115 --> 02:37:42.157]  We should talk about how we want to all be politically active going forward as active citizens.
[02:37:42.817 --> 02:37:46.638]  We should exercise some free speech of people that agree or disagree right there.
[02:37:47.219 --> 02:37:55.161]  All of this is accompanied in the First Amendment of our document that gives the government the right to exist.
[02:37:55.742 --> 02:38:01.424]  And I think that we, the people, need to start assembling, period, under that founding document.
[02:38:01.564 --> 02:38:03.184]  Otherwise the government's illegitimate.
[02:38:03.564 --> 02:38:07.146]  If it tries to trample or shut us down for
[02:38:08.559 --> 02:38:22.974]  For trying to set up and organize groups to discuss what we need to do to have a more perfect union as they say, you know, to form a more perfect union, then it has failed and it is time to
[02:38:23.975 --> 02:38:25.596]  Vote every single politician out.
[02:38:26.016 --> 02:38:38.603]  If the legislators in Arizona have a problem with the people of Arizona rising up to protest this peacefully, 72,000 people would be 1% and they just say, you know what?
[02:38:38.683 --> 02:38:40.264]  We want the judges to resign.
[02:38:40.584 --> 02:38:42.506]  We want the AGs to resign.
[02:38:42.806 --> 02:38:43.846]  And you know what we should do?
[02:38:44.367 --> 02:38:46.828]  Have them call, have a thousand people
[02:38:47.208 --> 02:38:49.030]  Every day call each politician.
[02:38:49.050 --> 02:38:49.250]  That's 90,000.
[02:38:49.570 --> 02:38:52.012]  You're talking 90,000 phone calls.
[02:38:52.292 --> 02:38:55.675]  This country, I'm calling on the whole country to step up.
[02:38:56.036 --> 02:39:09.407]  If they do not do what's right in Arizona, a thousand Americans across this country should call each of the 90 legislators in Arizona, calling for them to resign every single damn day for the next three years.
[02:39:10.007 --> 02:39:15.511]  And then bombard them with letters, bombard them outside their office with peaceful protesting.
[02:39:15.951 --> 02:39:24.277]  You just literally shame them out of office because they're disgusting and shameful people if they let this theft stand.
[02:39:25.632 --> 02:39:26.092]  Absolutely.
[02:39:26.212 --> 02:39:28.034]  Follow him on Telegram at BobbyPyton.
[02:39:28.074 --> 02:39:29.435]  That's P-I-T-O-N.
[02:39:29.475 --> 02:39:30.535]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:39:30.575 --> 02:39:36.499]  And that power that controls the masses using these, you know, cryptocurrency.
[02:39:36.899 --> 02:39:38.901]  They've toppled the banking system.
[02:39:38.941 --> 02:39:40.402]  They've toppled our political system.
[02:39:40.422 --> 02:39:41.643]  They've toppled the judiciary.
[02:39:41.683 --> 02:39:43.904]  The fear of the threat of being taken from your kids.
[02:39:43.944 --> 02:39:46.566]  The loss of your liberty as you're targeted by these corrupt
[02:39:47.466 --> 02:39:53.170]  People in the judiciary, these judges, they protect the criminals that are overtly assaulting the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:39:53.290 --> 02:39:54.911]  Folks, this is not hyperbole.
[02:39:55.411 --> 02:39:59.013]  This isn't shock value programming for justbanthis.tv.
[02:39:59.334 --> 02:40:01.235]  We're going to talk to Elizabeth Weinstein next.
[02:40:01.275 --> 02:40:04.577]  She's a 49-year-old mother, a graduate of Columbia University.
[02:40:04.657 --> 02:40:08.199]  The entire system has been weaponized against her and she will join us in just a minute.
[02:40:08.948 --> 02:40:09.508]  And welcome back.
[02:40:09.548 --> 02:40:10.509]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:40:10.529 --> 02:40:12.210]  There it is, redvoicemedia.com.
[02:40:12.250 --> 02:40:17.233]  That's where you can find me and we try to bring you the stories that nobody's talking about.
[02:40:17.273 --> 02:40:20.215]  It's pretty easy because the media is not talking about any of the real stories.
[02:40:20.255 --> 02:40:22.416]  This woman up next is absolutely amazing.
[02:40:23.036 --> 02:40:25.618]  It's really nerve-wracking to know
[02:40:26.802 --> 02:40:29.644]  Uh, how powerful these people are.
[02:40:29.705 --> 02:40:32.246]  These globalists are incredibly powerful.
[02:40:32.266 --> 02:40:35.889]  They will weaponize the entire system against you.
[02:40:35.989 --> 02:40:39.852]  And it starts with the mask, which was the basis for her arrest.
[02:40:39.912 --> 02:40:42.154]  And I'm talking about Elizabeth Weinstein.
[02:40:42.735 --> 02:40:44.716]  She is a 49-year-old mother.
[02:40:44.776 --> 02:40:47.278]  She's a graduate of Columbia University.
[02:40:47.979 --> 02:40:52.302]  She's the survivor of severe domestic violence, narcissistic abuse.
[02:40:52.882 --> 02:40:56.085]  She's a respected resident of Briarcliff Manor, New York.
[02:40:56.767 --> 02:41:03.069]  Her husband is a high profile and very powerful attorney with connections that run really deep in the judiciary.
[02:41:04.410 --> 02:41:09.351]  Now, her husband is also involved with pedophilia, and I'm going to explain why that's important in just a minute.
[02:41:09.391 --> 02:41:16.214]  But when you suspected that your husband had molested your son, you began to take steps to protect your children as any mother would do.
[02:41:16.634 --> 02:41:17.414]  Thank you for doing that.
[02:41:18.034 --> 02:41:21.696]  The judicial system and law enforcement were then weaponized against you.
[02:41:21.736 --> 02:41:22.676]  You have been kidnapped.
[02:41:23.228 --> 02:41:25.049]  You have lost contact with your children.
[02:41:25.069 --> 02:41:26.130]  You have been made homeless.
[02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:28.191]  You have been arrested multiple times.
[02:41:28.271 --> 02:41:31.153]  You've been sent to prison without an arraignment or any due process.
[02:41:31.594 --> 02:41:45.543]  You've been ordered by courts, involuntarily committed, and ordered to ingest what you call a lethal cocktail of prescription medication after being deemed incompetent by multiple judges, despite the fact that you have evidence to the contrary.
[02:41:46.844 --> 02:41:48.945]  Elizabeth Weinstein, how are you still upright?
[02:41:49.365 --> 02:41:50.226]  Take us through all of this.
[02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:54.953]  Well, somebody had your kids and they were trafficked to a pedophile.
[02:41:54.993 --> 02:41:56.434]  You do what you have to do, too.
[02:41:57.055 --> 02:42:08.904]  So, yeah, that started, this all started in May of last year when I found out that my husband, who I knew had a lifelong history of pedophilia and was himself a victim, was a pedophile.
[02:42:09.345 --> 02:42:20.654]  And I confronted him and told him that we would, as long as he would keep us safe and wouldn't hurt us anymore and wouldn't try and gaslight me, as he had been doing for the years, that we would help him.
[02:42:21.249 --> 02:42:27.372]  And he originally seemed like he wanted to stop and he wanted to get help, and then he disappeared.
[02:42:27.852 --> 02:42:30.513]  He went missing in short order.
[02:42:30.673 --> 02:42:32.434]  He tried to have me taken against my will.
[02:42:32.454 --> 02:42:44.640]  This issue of gaslighting with these pedophiles and trying to just claim that you're crazy, you know, and try and get you committed against your will is unfortunately a very old and sad story.
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:46.461]  But that's exactly what happened.
[02:42:47.762 --> 02:42:50.505]  After this, you confront him.
[02:42:50.545 --> 02:42:59.294]  You confront him and he runs, and then he disappears for a while, and then he uses his connections, he weaponizes the system against you, and then take us into the arrest.
[02:43:00.305 --> 02:43:00.545]  Sure.
[02:43:01.006 --> 02:43:18.486]  So on January 4th of 2021, I went to the Village Hall to file documents, and there's the Village Clerk didn't want to take my documents, so she called down, the Court Clerk actually, called down to the police station that was in the same building to say, hey, we don't want to deal with her, can you come up and take care of her?
[02:43:18.906 --> 02:43:20.426]  So they came up and they arrested me.
[02:43:20.847 --> 02:43:24.587]  And you can see, I don't even want to go into the details, you can just watch the video for yourself.
[02:43:24.947 --> 02:43:28.768]  Within two minutes of them coming upstairs, they had me pinned against the wall.
[02:43:28.808 --> 02:43:32.909]  Two guys, you know, using the mask as the reason.
[02:43:33.089 --> 02:43:43.532]  And then the two people who called the cops on me and complained about the mask are then later seen in the same police video not wearing the mask, saying, how did you get into that building?
[02:43:44.011 --> 02:43:51.413]  I'm yelling at the police and then you see the police tampering with the evidence trying to turn off their camera to not further implicate these people.
[02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:52.674]  So that was Phil Zegarelli.
[02:44:02.477 --> 02:44:12.603]  This is judicial tyranny, because then you were carted off, you were taken to prison without any arraignment, without any due process, and then you were involuntarily committed, you were forced medicated.
[02:44:12.643 --> 02:44:15.485]  Take us through that, because we just have a limited amount of time here.
[02:44:15.505 --> 02:44:27.792]  We've got to pay some bills with some breaks, but take us through that so we can really get an idea of how weaponized this system has become, how strong it is, and how it all works together to pin you down.
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.060]  Right.
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:32.422]  So what happened was I was falsely imprisoned, by the way.
[02:44:32.442 --> 02:44:33.783]  I wasn't given an arraignment.
[02:44:33.843 --> 02:44:36.545]  I was brought to solitary confinement, not allowed to call a lawyer.
[02:44:36.565 --> 02:44:40.448]  The video that you were just talking about came at a later time.
[02:44:41.468 --> 02:44:45.311]  I was remanded to be in prison for seven weeks.
[02:44:45.771 --> 02:44:49.794]  I ended up getting myself released after five days of being in solitary confinement.
[02:44:50.194 --> 02:44:55.658]  I then filed a federal lawsuit against the judge and the police officers in the village.
[02:44:56.298 --> 02:44:58.240]  And I filed that lawsuit on March 8th.
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.861]  And that's in the Southern District of New York.
[02:45:01.361 --> 02:45:05.082]  And on March 9th, I then get an email to say, come to town and pick up some papers.
[02:45:05.142 --> 02:45:06.203]  It was a complete setup.
[02:45:06.723 --> 02:45:07.263]  I showed up.
[02:45:07.983 --> 02:45:09.544]  The door was locked.
[02:45:09.564 --> 02:45:12.205]  They finally let me in and go upstairs to get my papers.
[02:45:12.265 --> 02:45:14.485]  And instead, I get jumped from behind by the policemen.
[02:45:14.966 --> 02:45:21.988]  And they're the same defendants who enlisted in my case, Detective Galbraith and our Chief of Police, DUI Bowetti.
[02:45:22.941 --> 02:45:27.967]  And you guys know what Elizabeth is saying right now either, because this is all documented.
[02:45:28.007 --> 02:45:29.288]  This is all on video.
[02:45:29.328 --> 02:45:32.652]  These cases that I've looked into are all public.
[02:45:32.672 --> 02:45:34.514]  I mean, you can look up the court file numbers.
[02:45:34.554 --> 02:45:37.939]  You can find that all of these federal cases are, it's out there.
[02:45:38.739 --> 02:45:43.764]  Uh, and this is a clear... When she says that she was jumped from behind, I mean, you should see this video.
[02:45:43.784 --> 02:45:44.846]  They lured her there.
[02:45:44.906 --> 02:45:45.546]  She was recording.
[02:45:45.586 --> 02:45:46.207]  She was happy.
[02:45:46.247 --> 02:45:49.510]  She was finally going to get some justice, but just felt it inside of her.
[02:45:49.530 --> 02:45:53.554]  I need to record this right now because, you know, this has happened before.
[02:45:53.574 --> 02:45:54.195]  I've been jumped before.
[02:45:54.215 --> 02:45:55.937]  I've been done unjustly before.
[02:45:56.397 --> 02:45:56.857]  I don't
[02:46:16.488 --> 02:46:17.569]  This woman is crazy!
[02:46:17.729 --> 02:46:21.312]  If you were to sit down and tell this story to anybody, they would say, this woman is nuts.
[02:46:21.372 --> 02:46:22.332]  She's out of her mind.
[02:46:22.933 --> 02:46:25.194]  What kind of a delusional fantasy world is she living in?
[02:46:25.475 --> 02:46:27.616]  But isn't that exactly how they want you to be?
[02:46:27.716 --> 02:46:33.000]  Because when you have the evidence or when you have the argument that there's no defense against, that's what you are.
[02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:33.840]  You're just crazy.
[02:46:34.101 --> 02:46:36.883]  So that people will discount you and not hear any of this.
[02:46:36.943 --> 02:46:37.323]  Is that right?
[02:46:38.331 --> 02:46:40.455]  Yeah, it's called the Martha Mitchell Effect.
[02:46:40.515 --> 02:46:45.724]  It's lazy, lame, you know, it's an easy thing because most people don't like to be called crazy.
[02:46:46.045 --> 02:46:49.191]  They also don't like to be called selfish and you will change your behavior.
[02:46:49.858 --> 02:46:51.019]  For being called those words.
[02:46:51.279 --> 02:46:52.359]  I am not one of those people.
[02:46:52.439 --> 02:46:54.961]  I'm like, go ahead and call me crazy because I've got the proof.
[02:46:55.481 --> 02:47:01.384]  And that is just an easy sign when somebody comes up and calls me those words to know that they're trying to get away with something.
[02:47:01.785 --> 02:47:03.025]  So I don't want people to believe that.
[02:47:03.045 --> 02:47:16.433]  A letter from a psychologist that was written on your behalf, I actually have it printed out right here, that was written on your behalf that says that after several meetings with you, this person does not deem you to be a threat to yourself, the safety of anybody else, that you're sustainable on
[02:47:17.173 --> 02:47:19.855]  I don't know what the medical terms were for this, but you're a Columbia grad.
[02:47:19.875 --> 02:47:22.317]  I mean, you're a multi-millionaire that's been made homeless.
[02:47:22.677 --> 02:47:28.221]  You joke around about being the only homeless person living out of a Porsche Cayenne, but this isn't a joking matter.
[02:47:28.261 --> 02:47:29.141]  This is very serious.
[02:47:29.161 --> 02:47:35.626]  You were taken into custody, placed in solitary confinement for refusing to wear a mask while you're in the process of filing federal lawsuits.
[02:47:35.646 --> 02:47:42.931]  I mean, this is retaliation, using the system to then kidnap you, force medicate you.
[02:47:43.331 --> 02:47:44.552]  This is incredibly serious.
[02:47:45.879 --> 02:47:48.541]  It very much is, and that was horrific.
[02:47:48.601 --> 02:47:54.925]  That was also, so after I was put in jail the second time, I was then sent to a hospital, St.
[02:47:54.945 --> 02:48:01.209]  Vincent's Hospital, and what we need to understand is this isn't just a simple, oops, did this somehow cut off over here?
[02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:05.652]  No, you're fine.
[02:48:06.232 --> 02:48:07.893]  Where can people find your Instagram?
[02:48:08.453 --> 02:48:14.097]  Just tell us the Instagram channel where people can see this because we don't have the time to go through the whole thing, but people should look at this.
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:15.300]  Sure.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:19.644]  Lizzie Harding-Wine on Instagram and Facebook is Elizabeth Harding-Weinstein.
[02:48:19.944 --> 02:48:21.105]  There's a petition at the top.
[02:48:21.385 --> 02:48:23.947]  This is a big issue, guys, because it's not just my story.
[02:48:24.528 --> 02:48:30.492]  I got my story out and so many people are calling me all over the country and all over the world that this is happening to them, too.
[02:48:30.793 --> 02:48:32.294]  They're being kidnapped by our police.
[02:48:33.095 --> 02:48:34.035]  That TV as well.
[02:48:34.516 --> 02:48:35.777]  Elizabeth Harding-Weinstein.
[02:48:36.437 --> 02:48:41.721]  Owen Schroer is up next with the War Room, always invigorating what's going on over there.
[02:48:41.741 --> 02:48:43.283]  Owen, what do you have coming up for us next?
[02:48:44.278 --> 02:48:51.907]  Well, I'm going to be joined by Alex Jones, and we're going to discuss how serious an issue the skyrocketing food prices are.
[02:48:52.387 --> 02:48:55.731]  It hasn't really reached the consciousness of the mainstream yet.
[02:48:55.751 --> 02:48:59.775]  It hasn't really reached the consciousness of the average American yet, but this is kind of a big sign.
[02:48:59.815 --> 02:49:00.977]  This is a historical sign.
[02:49:01.437 --> 02:49:02.678]  Food prices skyrocketing.
[02:49:02.998 --> 02:49:04.279]  There's a reason for that.
[02:49:04.839 --> 02:49:12.403]  And since it's the last Friday of the month, historically on The War Room, traditionally on The War Room, that means it's the Veterans Call-In Show.
[02:49:12.463 --> 02:49:16.025]  We take about 20, 30, 40 calls if I'm diligent enough.
[02:49:16.465 --> 02:49:18.608]  From great veterans on every Friday.
[02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:19.970]  We also have great veteran guests.
[02:49:20.310 --> 02:49:22.553]  So Nurse Erin is going to be joining me.
[02:49:22.594 --> 02:49:27.180]  Greg Reese, who's been putting up viral report after viral report, is going to be joining me as well.
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:32.627]  And Stu, you know, I'll just tell you as I hand you back the platform to close out the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:33.817 --> 02:49:35.818]  We're really witnessing an incredible time.
[02:49:35.839 --> 02:49:41.483]  I mean, the story that you just highlighted there, the vaccine shedding, the vaccine death, the fake pandemic.
[02:49:41.623 --> 02:49:44.645]  I mean, it's really such science fiction stuff.
[02:49:44.725 --> 02:49:49.328]  It's such movie theater plot stuff that the average human just can't even soak it in.
[02:49:49.368 --> 02:49:53.692]  Can't even accept that this is the reality of the planet right now, but that is the reality.
[02:49:53.752 --> 02:49:59.356]  So, I mean, this audience understands it, your audience understands it, and it gets weirder every day.
[02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:08.045]  Being in this twilight zone trying to wake people up as the tyranny is encroaching, as the destabilization increases, as now food prices skyrocketing.
[02:50:08.065 --> 02:50:10.147]  I mean, that should be like alarm bells going off, Stu.
[02:50:10.227 --> 02:50:13.471]  So, we'll see if America wakes up as the signals are everywhere.
[02:50:14.266 --> 02:50:15.206]  And that's what we have to do.
[02:50:15.266 --> 02:50:17.207]  We have to wake people up, and we're here every day.
[02:50:17.747 --> 02:50:18.408]  Owen, you're here.
[02:50:18.868 --> 02:50:19.468]  The War Room.
[02:50:19.508 --> 02:50:22.930]  BanThis.tv, where we'll get that link up for the story, that Instagram thing.
[02:50:22.990 --> 02:50:24.290]  Owen, you should check this thing out.
[02:50:24.310 --> 02:50:30.593]  I mean, this woman, the story that she tells, it's just, it's mind-blowing, mind-numbing.
[02:50:30.673 --> 02:50:31.493]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:50:31.533 --> 02:50:33.594]  Come and find me at RedVoiceMedia.com.
[02:50:39.184 --> 02:50:45.588]  I get so nervous about supporting this broadcast and then God just comes through again.
[02:50:45.608 --> 02:50:51.312]  It's like every time we get down to the line and I start going into the red, something good happens.
[02:50:51.332 --> 02:50:53.533]  We go back to the black because I don't want to cut back our crew.
[02:50:54.134 --> 02:50:55.074]  I don't want to, uh,
[02:50:56.428 --> 02:50:56.748]  We're good.
[02:51:14.076 --> 02:51:17.297]  We get them, they sell out, and it's a month, six months, or longer until we get it in.
[02:51:17.337 --> 02:51:25.739]  That's why we had to discontinue quite a few of the products, is we just couldn't get them anymore if they were California-grade standard, really clean, really good, and also high quality.
[02:51:25.759 --> 02:51:30.480]  Because, you know, they test all our products to the highest level, and if they find anything, it's big national news.
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:32.321]  We go to a level that really nobody does.
[02:51:33.766 --> 02:51:34.567]  We're good to go.
[02:52:00.282 --> 02:52:01.923]  Well, because it's different formulas for different people.
[02:52:01.943 --> 02:52:07.106]  Knockout is eight small doses of different natural things that help you sleep well.
[02:52:09.768 --> 02:52:12.990]  We came out with stuff even stronger for those that want things that are even stronger.
[02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:20.495]  Take Rocket Rest that is close to selling out, but I'm going to keep it at 40% off until it does sell out because it will be a lost leader.
[02:52:20.515 --> 02:52:23.377]  Even though we sell out of it, people are going to want to reorder it after they get it.
[02:52:24.853 --> 02:52:25.774]  It's that good.
[02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:27.096]  What does it have in it?
[02:52:27.176 --> 02:52:28.258]  Well, it has L-theanine.
[02:52:28.498 --> 02:52:29.860]  That stuff in turkey makes you sleep.
[02:52:30.561 --> 02:52:32.804]  Gamma-amino-butyric acid.
[02:52:32.824 --> 02:52:34.407]  5-HTP.
[02:52:37.014 --> 02:52:37.214]  I think?
[02:53:00.037 --> 02:53:00.478]  In the morning.
[02:53:00.558 --> 02:53:04.682]  This is way stronger than knockout, which is still a great formula.
[02:53:04.722 --> 02:53:06.244]  Some of you probably don't want to take this.
[02:53:06.364 --> 02:53:07.786]  Okay, maybe take half a capsule when you do.
[02:53:08.166 --> 02:53:09.768]  And then we have also down and out.
[02:53:10.089 --> 02:53:12.692]  That's a very similar formula, but it's a liquid.
[02:53:12.792 --> 02:53:13.473]  Very, very strong.
[02:53:14.033 --> 02:53:16.216]  It doesn't have the 5-HTP in it, though.
[02:53:16.776 --> 02:53:18.438]  It has instead the valerian route.
[02:53:18.778 --> 02:53:22.242]  So these were three different amazing sleep rest formulas.
[02:53:22.262 --> 02:53:22.762]  Here's the key.
[02:53:23.283 --> 02:53:29.829]  All the studies show that deep sleep is just as important as essential vitamins and minerals to your immune system.
[02:53:30.069 --> 02:53:37.357]  So during these times especially, get that deep clear sleep and funding InfoWar at infowarstore.com with these amazing natural sleep aids.
[02:53:38.899 --> 02:53:50.102]  For the last four years, while the chi-com-backed big tech has been censoring and blackballing and deplatforming conservatives, nationalists, and Christians, we've heard over and over again, oh, just build your own internet.
[02:53:50.682 --> 02:53:59.065]  But everybody that tries to build their own social media, that tries to build their own websites, that tries to build their own radio or TV networks, gets savagely attacked.
[02:53:59.585 --> 02:54:02.727]  In fact, if your network is successful, that's when they really come after you.
[02:54:02.767 --> 02:54:03.628]  This is predatory.
[02:54:04.088 --> 02:54:05.549]  This is martial law.
[02:54:05.609 --> 02:54:07.370]  This is information warfare.
[02:54:08.071 --> 02:54:11.093]  InfoWars is one of the only platforms still on air.
[02:54:11.693 --> 02:54:15.836]  We have an electronic Berlin Wall of tyranny and censorship and deplatforming.
[02:54:16.161 --> 02:54:17.182]  Descending everywhere.
[02:54:17.682 --> 02:54:18.964]  There's only a few people left.
[02:54:19.344 --> 02:54:20.205]  Rush Limbaugh's dead.
[02:54:20.265 --> 02:54:21.966]  Tucker Carlson's barely hanging on.
[02:54:22.467 --> 02:54:25.409]  But InfoWars is as strong as ever, thanks to you.
[02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:30.714]  But I want to talk about something that doesn't just empower InfoWars, but empowers everyone together.
[02:54:31.174 --> 02:54:33.737]  And that's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[02:54:33.937 --> 02:54:36.239]  That's InfoWarsDomains.com.
[02:54:36.439 --> 02:54:43.225]  That link takes you right to Epic, the only major domain registrar that's been around for a long time
[02:54:43.581 --> 02:54:48.102]  that does not censor individuals because of their political or spiritual content.
[02:54:48.822 --> 02:54:58.865]  That's why you need to go to InfoWarsDomains.com if you have domains that you've registered with GoDaddy or others and move them there to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[02:54:59.205 --> 02:55:09.547]  If you go directly to Epic, they're awesome, they have servers, they have all sorts of other internet services, they basically have everything you need and they are expanding because there is that need
[02:55:09.929 --> 02:55:11.390]  Because of all the censorship and control.
[02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:15.093]  So they're building that free internet infrastructure that didn't exist.
[02:55:15.574 --> 02:55:27.424]  But when you go to InfoWarsDomains.com, it sends a link to them so that we get 25% of the sign-up and we get 5% of any server services or other things you get.
[02:55:27.704 --> 02:55:29.846]  So it's a win-win for everybody and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:55:30.086 --> 02:55:31.227]  It protects your domains.
[02:55:31.427 --> 02:55:32.628]  It helps you build your website.
[02:55:33.128 --> 02:55:36.071]  Whatever you do, go to InfoWarsDomains.com today and check it out.
