[00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.342]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.163]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:49.229]  of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[00:00:49.369 --> 00:01:00.893]  And I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation, you will understand why history, the history of the last 32 years that I've been the Director of NIAID, will tell
[00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:09.621]  The next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with.
[00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:15.387]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency transmission.
[00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.589]  Saturday, April 3rd, 2021.
[00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:19.909]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.931]  I want to thank the crew for coming in and doing a great job with us here.
[00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:31.854]  I have two of our great investigative researchers, Rob Dew and Mike Halperin, here with me in studio.
[00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:37.136]  And we again want to thank all the viewers and listeners that have tuned in to this information.
[00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.237]  It could not be of any
[00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.055]  Now you just saw Fauci four years ago, right after Trump got in office, saying he will be challenged by a surprise outbreak.
[00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.256]  Wow, he knows about a surprise!
[00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:29.359]  And then out of the Wuhan lab that even Newsweek and Reuters report, he basically controlled 11 programs on of gain of function viruses, chimera viruses in the Corona family, even listed and called COVID-21, COVID-25, COVID-2019.
[00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.244]  This individual then had John Hopkins that he basically runs with Bill Gates.
[00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:37.285]  We'll show you all the documents.
[00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:45.517]  Develop war games two months after Trump got into office, laying all of this out.
[00:02:45.537 --> 00:02:47.098]  So we're going to show you the documents.
[00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:52.501]  We're going to show you the quotes, and then you're going to see in real time as they rolled it out.
[00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.803]  Now, most people that are informed have heard about event 201.
[00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:58.364]  They've heard about Operation Lockstep.
[00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:00.766]  They've heard about Crimson Contagion.
[00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.527]  They've heard about Disease X and the UN drills.
[00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.350]  But have you heard about SPARS?
[00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:25.391]  2025, 2028.
[00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:25.391]  It is all of those plans together, but not set in the near future like those previous drills were, but set out a few more years in the future, but it's actually paralleling the time we're in now.
[00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:27.593]  So just superimpose 2025 to 2028 with 2020 to 2023.
[00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:28.994]  And it is exactly
[00:03:37.847 --> 00:03:38.707]  What's happening now?
[00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:39.828]  Here's what's devastating.
[00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:46.010]  We're about 13 months into the simulation that, again, is not really a simulation.
[00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.410]  They're using that to cover their operations.
[00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.611]  In case they get caught with the documents, they just say it's part of the drill.
[00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:56.373]  That's a classic operation by intelligence agencies, governments, but also health agencies.
[00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:14.851]  Next, they say that within six months to a year of people being inoculated with these experimental GMO gene therapies, that you will have massive brain damage and spongiform encephalopathy, basically, or prion disease, mad cow disease.
[00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:18.272]  Now, it's not just them saying this.
[00:04:18.312 --> 00:04:21.133]  This is in 2017, they produced this document.
[00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:25.195]  Brett Raffauti says, the surprise is coming soon.
[00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.335]  And they say in there, it's going to cause encephalopathy in children and adults, you name it.
[00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:39.200]  And there's going to be a huge outcry and they're going to blame the politicians, not Big Pharma, for speeding it up.
[00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:41.802]  That Trump really stepped into it.
[00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:43.584]  He got set up big time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:46.586]  So I want to explain something.
[00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:52.131]  We could go for 10 hours straight just reading and not scratch the surface of this.
[00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.294]  We have read all of this together that you see.
[00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:58.506]  Mike Alperin, Rob Dew, the rest of the crew.
[00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:09.479]  And when you see it, I have been physically nauseous before we went on air today because this, this, this is the smoking gun.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.763]  And these, these, these mad scientist types.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.582]  Literally think we're too stupid to figure this out and stop them, and they're not even hiding what they're doing.
[00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:31.029]  And then I've got Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all the rest of them admitting, and Klaus Schwab, oh, this is really to lower the human population and cut carbon, and we need climate lockdowns now, and this has been wonderful.
[00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.670]  And look, I've got headlines right here.
[00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.511]  The Times of London.
[00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.553]  Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:42.696]  And then it goes into how they're taking control of the world medical system through the UN.
[00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.030]  To carry out this depopulation.
[00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.592]  This article is from more than 10 years ago.
[00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:54.673]  And I literally have hundreds of these.
[00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:58.894]  I just mentioned to you spongiform encephalopathy or prion disease.
[00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.415]  Microbiology Infectious Diseases Journal.
[00:06:02.735 --> 00:06:06.357]  COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines and the risk of prion disease.
[00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:10.998]  That was put out in 2021 by prestigious scientists.
[00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:12.479]  Here's the deal.
[00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:32.684]  It's in the SPARS 2025-2028 document that that's going to be the huge crisis that they'll then have the medical system take over and get more control and get a giant global bailout, a giant global Marshall Fund, Marshall Plan for.
[00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:39.906]  So again, as I keep saying, if they create a crisis this big, they've got to have a bigger crisis to cover up the last crisis, like cover up
[00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:44.288]  All the vaccine problems, all the tainted vaccines, all the sicknesses, all the autism.
[00:06:44.688 --> 00:06:45.128]  The U.N.
[00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:48.469]  said in 2019 at the December emergency meeting, head of the U.N.
[00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.690]  vaccine program said these vaccines are killing people.
[00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.451]  They don't work.
[00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.331]  Doctors don't believe in them.
[00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.212]  Remember all that?
[00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:54.292]  We'll put the article on screen.
[00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:56.373]  Remember all that?
[00:06:59.114 --> 00:07:01.055]  And so now they have this big crisis.
[00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.616]  It's even bigger vaccine damage.
[00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:03.436]  And they admit that.
[00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:06.898]  And then they get more control because the medical system then responds to that.
[00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:10.079]  So this is how you enslave people while you kill them.
[00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:17.570]  We're going to lay every bit of it and how the Rockefeller Foundation is behind it.
[00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.691]  Bill Gates is just their front, along with Fauci.
[00:07:20.912 --> 00:07:24.894]  Here in just a moment, we also have CNN and others saying no one should have freedom.
[00:07:25.154 --> 00:07:27.456]  They need to keep us locked down until we submit the vaccines.
[00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:29.197]  They admit it's not about your safety.
[00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:34.180]  It's about you submitting the vaccine, which is connected not just to brain damage, but also
[00:07:35.632 --> 00:07:38.277]  Infertility, this is the smoking gun.
[00:07:38.678 --> 00:07:40.582]  SPARS 2025 Scenario 2028 from John Hopkins.
[00:07:40.983 --> 00:07:41.083]  So.
[00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:55.203]  Give us about a two minute summation before we get into how it's happening, the end game, where they're taking us, the proof Rob do.
[00:07:55.543 --> 00:08:03.009]  And then we'll get Mike Halpern to also give us his boil down summation, because both of you have good angles on this, reading these documents over the last few weeks yourselves.
[00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:15.057]  And then we'll start drilling directly into the documents themselves and showing people the war game, which isn't a war game, it's a war plan on us, the population, their admission, that's what it is.
[00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:17.039]  And then in real time, the drill,
[00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:20.314]  Yeah, so the parallels on this are...
[00:08:31.072 --> 00:08:39.198]  Just from a, when you looked at 9-11 and you saw the parallels that happened, this has got the same thing in it with like massive power outages.
[00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:41.200]  You've got a male and female president.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.062]  The president who's a male stops after a few years.
[00:08:45.122 --> 00:08:50.146]  Or it's the female who's, she's only in for one term and then she leaves and then the male president takes over.
[00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:51.327]  We kind of have that going on.
[00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:52.668]  There's so many parallels.
[00:08:52.728 --> 00:08:55.490]  The disease sort of looks the same, but it's a little longer now.
[00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.933]  It's, they've created a worse type of gain of function now.
[00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:00.073]  It's got more gain of function.
[00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:01.375]  I don't know.
[00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:25.154]  Lockstep is like the granddaddy.
[00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:27.335]  This is Sparr's pandemic is the daddy.
[00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:32.917]  And then you got the two kids, Crimson Contagion and Event 201, along with these other little exercises they do.
[00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:38.619]  But this is the blueprint for how they're going to censor people, but they don't say censorship.
[00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:40.099]  They have another little cute word for it.
[00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:47.941]  This is how they're going to cover up side effects, how they're going to roll out side effects, how they're going to talk about side effects, how they're even going to talk about Tuskegee when that comes out.
[00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:52.643]  And we've seen all this stuff happen to us under the COVID lockdown in real time.
[00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:57.064]  So it's really, um, this is what it is.
[00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:58.604]  They call it a futuristic scenario.
[00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:02.165]  It should be a futuristic script for public health risk communicators.
[00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:07.426]  Cause this is a, this is to give talking points to all the minions on what to say, what file to pull out.
[00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:13.007]  Like you were mentioning, Dr. Strangelove, when they pull out a file for a different scenario, they got somebody talking about Tuskegee.
[00:10:13.287 --> 00:10:13.967]  They pull it out.
[00:10:14.007 --> 00:10:14.868]  They give it to Fauci.
[00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:17.208]  Fauci goes, Oh, we have a black woman making this vaccine.
[00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:17.708]  It's fine.
[00:10:17.988 --> 00:10:18.368]  Don't worry.
[00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:21.329]  But why would a black woman hurt you with a vaccine?
[00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:24.170]  So they have all these, they're thinking about this stuff.
[00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.372]  And they had black nurses up front when it first rolled out before blacks even questioned it.
[00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:29.532]  They'd already done studies and knew it.
[00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:34.094]  They already have Yale, before all this happened, wargaming every scenario as well.
[00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:36.875]  They don't deny they're wargaming all this.
[00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:37.475]  Right.
[00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:39.396]  And it's all public how they're wargaming it.
[00:10:39.824 --> 00:10:40.765]  But it's going to get real.
[00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:44.727]  As we get into this and we show the slides where the similarities are, you're going to be freaked out.
[00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:45.507]  And you should be.
[00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:46.748]  You should be freaked out.
[00:10:47.048 --> 00:10:47.889]  You should get awake.
[00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:49.109]  You should get activated.
[00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.291]  And you should start telling people about what's going on.
[00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:53.612]  Because a lot of people haven't heard as far as pandemic.
[00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:54.933]  Not a lot of people heard about this.
[00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:58.235]  This is one that it's, it's there, but you really have to be looking for it.
[00:10:58.255 --> 00:11:00.637]  You have to go seek it out and we're going to put this all out.
[00:11:00.657 --> 00:11:04.219]  We're going to put the link to it on, on when we post this on InfoWars.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.520]  So you could go read it for yourself.
[00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:06.481]  Here it is right here.
[00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:07.122]  This is all it.
[00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:08.843]  It's 70 something pages long right there.
[00:11:09.303 --> 00:11:13.206]  All right, Rob, great job going over all this, getting all these slides that you prepared ready.
[00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:16.949]  I want to talk to Mike Halpern a little bit, get his take on this before we dive into it.
[00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:19.711]  But here's really the most important part about all this.
[00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:25.450]  They ran drills on 9-11 of attacking the World Trade Centers with hijacked jets.
[00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.390]  That's ABC News.
[00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:28.412]  Doesn't mean there isn't radical Islam.
[00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:29.852]  Doesn't mean they weren't working with the globalists.
[00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.134]  But the point was to make sure there was a stand down.
[00:11:32.674 --> 00:11:42.840]  They had drills so that when NORAD saw this, they stood down with the jets and didn't shoot down the aircraft until finally they disregarded orders and did shoot down Flight 93 that was going towards the Capitol.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.582]  That was supposed to be destroyed and full martial law would have come in.
[00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:46.482]  Folks, look this up.
[00:11:46.502 --> 00:11:47.043]  It'll blow you away.
[00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:47.663]  That's
[00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.251]  2028, but it's really 2020-2023.
[00:12:09.412 --> 00:12:15.395]  And it's exactly what's happening at exactly the same time, in exactly the same order.
[00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:27.922]  And now, just like Sherry Tenpenny and other scientists, Wolfgang Wudarg, have looked at the documents and they say, oh my gosh, they've looked at the vaccines, the mRNA vaccines.
[00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:31.824]  This is going to cause protein buildup in the brain.
[00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:32.638]  I don't
[00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:54.736]  We're going to vaccinate everybody, but it's going to cause a bunch of brain damage and we'll have to have a secret fund that pays people off.
[00:12:54.996 --> 00:12:55.916]  I mean, wow!
[00:12:56.197 --> 00:12:58.178]  So again, that's only one facet.
[00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:03.562]  Mike Alpert, spend a few minutes giving us your general overview before we dig in.
[00:13:04.164 --> 00:13:07.366]  I mean it's a little bit disheartening just to be able to read what we're living right now.
[00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:10.408]  The Event 201 is basically a one-time deal.
[00:13:10.428 --> 00:13:12.409]  The Crimson Contagion is a one-time deal.
[00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:20.074]  This SPARS 2025, we're living in this every single day and it says word for word what's going to be happening in the near future.
[00:13:20.554 --> 00:13:23.196]  So whether we want to reject it or accept it, it's happening.
[00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:29.821]  They say, word for word, what's going to happen to your children, the health effects of all the different vaccines.
[00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:31.622]  We're going to be going over that in a little bit.
[00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:36.527]  The timeline, exactly when they'll be able to roll out the vaccine, when SPARS emerges.
[00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:41.791]  Now, this exercise was put in the future, which I think threw a lot of people off.
[00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:47.656]  It showed, okay, maybe this isn't the pandemic, but in my opinion, this is it.
[00:13:47.716 --> 00:13:49.197]  We are living inside of this, Alex.
[00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:51.119]  Well, exactly.
[00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:52.100]  Again, I'm going to explain.
[00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:53.655]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:10.833]  Well, let's say you're a serial killer.
[00:14:10.873 --> 00:14:13.035]  You're writing about the women you've kidnapped, murdered, and tortured.
[00:14:13.055 --> 00:14:14.857]  Well, you just write about it in a horror novel.
[00:14:15.357 --> 00:14:17.799]  That way, if the cops ever catch you, they go, oh, that's just my novel.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.023]  But they can go, oh, the old barn with an old church back in the woods where the women are buried.
[00:14:23.324 --> 00:14:24.284]  They go back and dig it up.
[00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:24.905]  The women are there.
[00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.026]  It's not a novel.
[00:14:26.586 --> 00:14:31.910]  It is a plan, an operation that's now being carried out.
[00:14:32.631 --> 00:14:32.951]  Let's go!
[00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:57.259]  We're going to show you that as well, that are running all the other events and scenarios.
[00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:05.686]  And then when you place all four of the drills together, it's word for word, real time, what's happening when you move the dates from 2025 and 2028 to 2020, 2023.
[00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:08.388]  So Mike, you've got more points to make, then we'll start plowing into it.
[00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:19.516]  Yeah, just the fact that they're really going after pregnant women, they're going after children, they're going after people with chronic health conditions.
[00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:23.099]  They know that, and it says it right here, the fact that the majority of U.S.
[00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:31.965]  citizens willing to be vaccinated had already been immunized, the negative publicity surrounding adverse reactions had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates.
[00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:36.489]  Basically what that means is that once they get everybody, then the effects come in Alex.
[00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:43.249]  And they surged it so fast that they just kind of drowned out all the deaths, all the illnesses.
[00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:46.011]  4,000 dead in Europe, almost 3,000 dead here from the vaccine.
[00:15:46.031 --> 00:15:47.432]  That's the CDC's own numbers.
[00:15:47.692 --> 00:15:48.973]  Bill Gates said it'll hurt or kill 700,000.
[00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:51.975]  So they really got us ready up front this time.
[00:15:52.075 --> 00:15:53.996]  Well, and the way they do that is with the fact-checking.
[00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:54.857]  All the fact-checking.
[00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:58.219]  Because if you type in any of this stuff, like Hank Aaron died from the COVID vaccine.
[00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:00.580]  Oh, no, the fact-checkers all said that didn't happen.
[00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:07.105]  He was, uh, the medical examiner looked at him, even though when you call the medical examiner, the medical examiner says, no, we never looked at the body.
[00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:21.501]  But they use that, and so by placing those fact-checking organizations at the top of every search using Google, using any of the other major search engines, then it quickly dispels, it dampers that effect that it would have.
[00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:24.384]  That's right, and what we're saying here is, folks, when you read
[00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:34.148]  The 70-something page document, SPARS 2025-2028, and the accompanying documents that connect to it, it blows you away because they talk about how to counter us.
[00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.189]  They talk about how they're going to have fact checkers.
[00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:38.150]  They talk about how they're going to block real news.
[00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.790]  They talk about how they're going to censor.
[00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.771]  They talk about how they're going to cover up the deaths.
[00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:43.432]  I mean, it is, it is,
[00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:47.364]  Hitler wrote Mein Kampf and said what he was going to do, and then he did it!
[00:16:47.784 --> 00:16:51.286]  And you're sitting here reading this, it just blows you away.
[00:16:51.346 --> 00:16:55.329]  So, since I mentioned the Rockefeller Foundation, let's just start there as we go into the document.
[00:16:56.618 --> 00:17:02.784]  Dr. Nick Bright joins the Rockefeller Foundation to lead Pandemic Prevention Institute development.
[00:17:03.224 --> 00:17:05.787]  Well, guess where he already was before?
[00:17:06.227 --> 00:17:15.476]  That's right, with Fauci running the whole thing to begin with, running Operation Crimson Contagion, which again was two years ago.
[00:17:16.317 --> 00:17:25.880]  To prepare the same towns, the same cities in China, basically the same stories, the same maps, even the same computer generators, same reporters, same tweets.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.101]  It's incredible.
[00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:30.362]  Put out as a drill, then later put out as exactly real.
[00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:37.684]  And then now he's setting up Vaccine Global Response to create global health policy for the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:43.314]  And they use a lot of this vocabulary that I think the viewers and listeners really need to learn.
[00:17:43.714 --> 00:17:44.614]  One is stakeholder.
[00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:48.976]  How many times is Klaus Schwab talking about, we're all stakeholders, the health stakeholders.
[00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:51.417]  We all need to be in this circular economy.
[00:17:51.597 --> 00:17:53.098]  They talk about that in the documents.
[00:17:53.438 --> 00:18:05.303]  They're talking about people with respiratory conditions because if whatever they're spraying from the sky or whatever they're putting in the soil or the food, and that all comes together with a vaccine, then the effects really come.
[00:18:05.323 --> 00:18:06.184]  Binary weapon!
[00:18:06.664 --> 00:18:07.164]  That's right, Alex.
[00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:22.758]  And begin here.
[00:18:23.198 --> 00:18:25.941]  Here is the project team who is on it.
[00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:29.804]  All these different top eugenicists, top globalists from around the country.
[00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:32.927]  John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
[00:18:33.428 --> 00:18:39.634]  Here is the report that we're going to be quoting to you out of every single bit of this right now.
[00:18:39.734 --> 00:18:41.435]  So here's the timeline.
[00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:44.852]  And then here is the boil down that you did, Mike.
[00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.953]  SPARS 2025 highlights.
[00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:51.594]  Let's just read these highlights and then, oh, we're not the fake news.
[00:18:51.614 --> 00:18:56.056]  We're going to show you from the document the slides after we read the highlights.
[00:18:56.076 --> 00:18:58.017]  But Mike, read us these highlights.
[00:18:58.257 --> 00:19:01.460]  Okay, so first we're going to start talking about the neurological symptoms.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.445]  You can't even believe that inside of SPARS it says that children are going to be getting neurological symptoms.
[00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:09.327]  People are going to be getting neurological symptoms.
[00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:10.488]  Six months to a year later.
[00:19:10.748 --> 00:19:11.829]  Six months to a year later.
[00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.510]  Which is a soft kill.
[00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.311]  It's a delayed weapon.
[00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:16.413]  That's what Dr. Sherry Tenpenny talked about.
[00:19:16.693 --> 00:19:18.274]  Before this document was even known, yeah.
[00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:19.915]  And we just discovered this document.
[00:19:19.935 --> 00:19:21.716]  I'm sure it's on the internet, but now we're covering it now.
[00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:25.378]  And this can be found inside of the SPARS document, word for word.
[00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:39.924]  As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of adverse side effects began to emerge.
[00:19:40.484 --> 00:19:49.386]  As the investigations grew in intensity, several high-ranking officials at the CDC and FDA were forced to step down and withdraw from government.
[00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:53.147]  They're setting up the health officials and the politicians to take the fall for this.
[00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:57.348]  Don't forget, the people who fund all this are not the health officials.
[00:19:57.448 --> 00:19:58.269]  It's not Fauci.
[00:19:58.309 --> 00:19:59.369]  It's the guys behind the scenes.
[00:19:59.449 --> 00:19:59.929]  It's Gates.
[00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:04.351]  And that's what the UN Head of Vaccine Program said a year and a half ago in Switzerland.
[00:20:04.631 --> 00:20:06.051]  She said, we're not allowed to test it.
[00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:09.132]  It's given to us by Big Pharma and Bill Gates and it's hurting people.
[00:20:09.272 --> 00:20:09.973]  She's on video.
[00:20:10.373 --> 00:20:15.275]  And you talked about the board that's above it, the ethics board that's above them, above the hospitals, above the doctors.
[00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:19.576]  So this is a high level, highly sophisticated military operation.
[00:20:20.117 --> 00:20:26.959]  Near the end of 2027, which is two years after SPARS emerges, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge.
[00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:27.819]  That's two years later.
[00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.020]  So this keeps compounding.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.263]  Several parents claimed that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms.
[00:20:33.623 --> 00:20:44.572]  That month, a group of parents whose children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalitis in the wake of Corvax vaccination sued the federal government demanding removal of the liability shield.
[00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:50.111]  Protecting the pharmaceutical companies responsible for developing and manufacturing Corvax.
[00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:51.973]  So let me stop you again, overhead shot.
[00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:54.355]  I give you a hundred mainline articles.
[00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:56.476]  I give you 50 studies literally that I've seen.
[00:20:56.757 --> 00:21:04.803]  Here's a top-line study worried that scientists looked at the vaccine, what it does with proteins in the body, saying it'll grow proteins in the brain and basically give you mad cow.
[00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:08.186]  This is this year them looking at the vaccine saying that scientists.
[00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:12.690]  There it is in a document four years ago, put out by John Hopkins and Fauci.
[00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.631]  I mean, holy
[00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.191]  Hell.
[00:21:14.472 --> 00:21:14.892]  Keep going.
[00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:23.379]  So the most important part of that last paragraph is that the majority of people who've gotten the vaccination, which is I think at least over 80 million Americans have already gotten the vaccine.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.661]  Oh yeah, they're targeting America.
[00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:25.662]  A bunch of countries aren't doing it.
[00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:26.242]  They're pulling out.
[00:21:26.843 --> 00:21:29.205]  France and other places won't do it, but oh, we're the most vaccinated now.
[00:21:29.953 --> 00:21:32.215]  They don't realize that they cannot sue.
[00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:35.857]  They can't go after the vaccine maker.
[00:21:36.237 --> 00:21:41.560]  Then it says that they're going to realize that they got damaged and then they're going to go after the vaccine maker.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.964]  So expect maybe in the next couple months to a year, people starting to wake up saying, wait, maybe my kid did get injured.
[00:21:47.304 --> 00:21:48.785]  And who is responsible for this?
[00:21:48.885 --> 00:21:59.754]  Well, and like we were saying with the binary weapon, you get the vaccine, and then when you get exposed to the actual virus, your immune system kicks into overdrive, and that's how you get the brain swelling, the encephalopathy, all that stuff.
[00:21:59.874 --> 00:22:02.115]  And when you come in contact with a regular virus, now you have it.
[00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:03.136]  Exactly.
[00:22:03.797 --> 00:22:07.039]  And here's the thing, in this whole thing, this whole document, they have their disclaimer.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:15.306]  And at the end they go, the infectious pathogens, medical countermeasures, characters, new media experts, blah blah blah, are hereby described as entirely fictional.
[00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:17.527]  They say it's entirely fictional, but when we show you
[00:22:18.428 --> 00:22:21.970]  How it relates in the real world scenario, you're gonna be blown away.
[00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:30.775]  Four years after they put this out, in a huge scientific battle plan report, top scientists are saying word for word it's doing what they said it would do.
[00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:31.555]  Please continue.
[00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:33.256]  The fact that the majority of U.S.
[00:22:33.296 --> 00:22:42.702]  citizens willing to be vaccinated had already been immunized and negative publicity surrounding adverse reactions had little effect on nationwide vaccination rates.
[00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:49.187]  As these cases emerged, patients began filing for compensation under the PREP Act.
[00:22:49.728 --> 00:23:01.637]  Due to lingering uncertainties over possible links between vaccination and reported neurological symptoms, their compensation requests were placed on indefinite hold pending further data analysis.
[00:23:02.198 --> 00:23:06.501]  Because you can't get data because they skipped the animal trials and just did mass random testing.
[00:23:06.861 --> 00:23:08.563]  It hits you later so they'll be able to cover it up.
[00:23:08.943 --> 00:23:17.452]  This cohort, many of whom adamantly supported the Coravax vaccine, initially quickly took to social media to publicize their issues.
[00:23:17.492 --> 00:23:22.236]  So they're warning all their stakeholders that they're going to go to social media first.
[00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:24.719]  So that's why the censorship started in 2017.
[00:23:24.919 --> 00:23:27.001]  And that's why they say we've got to shut everybody down.
[00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:27.782]  And exactly.
[00:23:27.802 --> 00:23:32.707]  So in 2017, which lines up with the years they launched early, they began taking all the anti-vaxxers off.
[00:23:32.827 --> 00:23:45.340]  And there's an article, it was about Facebook, and it's like, these 12 people, and it's people like Robert Kennedy Jr., Sherry Timpenny, other people like that, Ty Bollinger, these are the 12 people that are putting out all the vaccine misinformation.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.621]  And let's go further, Rob.
[00:23:46.782 --> 00:23:49.484]  I'm going to show a whole stack of mainline news from two years ago.
[00:23:50.205 --> 00:23:56.108]  Where they go, oh, Bill Gates is taking over all the media control and big tech to censor anti-vaxxers ahead of time.
[00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.609]  I'll show all of them in a moment.
[00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:58.889]  I mean, I'm talking to Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:59.549 --> 00:24:05.412]  So, so, so again, this is where you cannot complain about what happens to you medically on the internet before it happens.
[00:24:05.452 --> 00:24:06.052]  Gates does this.
[00:24:06.072 --> 00:24:06.593]  Comprende?
[00:24:06.793 --> 00:24:07.113]  Keep going.
[00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:12.216]  And there's no coincidence that the Facebook censorship of InfoWars happened in 2017, around that time.
[00:24:12.276 --> 00:24:16.599]  They targeted very specific channels to know who's going to talk about the vaccination effects.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.341]  So they needed to be able to do that beforehand.
[00:24:19.982 --> 00:24:30.128]  As the pandemic tapered off, several influential politicians and agency representatives came under fire for sensationalizing the severity of the event for perceived political gain.
[00:24:30.148 --> 00:24:31.249]  They're talking about Cuomo.
[00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:33.551]  They're talking about Newsom.
[00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:35.212]  A lot of them.
[00:24:36.394 --> 00:24:37.755]  He got an award, Cuomo.
[00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:38.496]  What award?
[00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:38.997]  He got an Emmy.
[00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:39.878]  He got an Emmy?
[00:24:40.018 --> 00:24:40.178]  Yeah.
[00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:41.760]  So he sensationalized it.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.861]  He's going to take the fall for this.
[00:24:43.803 --> 00:24:47.385]  So they even pre-programmed, years before it happens, how they're going to burn certain people.
[00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:47.705]  Continue.
[00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:48.206]  That's right.
[00:24:48.926 --> 00:24:56.491]  To determine how to best distribute limited doses of Coravax to members of priority groups across the country, the U.S.
[00:24:56.531 --> 00:25:10.159]  government resorted to new, controversial tactics, notably having healthcare providers access patients' electronic health records to determine the number of individuals in high-risk populations receiving care in particular areas.
[00:25:10.479 --> 00:25:11.300]  Now in the United States,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.581]  We're good to go.
[00:25:30.475 --> 00:25:34.579]  And that puts you into the Xi Jinping Apple run QR code system.
[00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:36.401]  They're already spying on all that.
[00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:44.769]  Big Tech's merged with Big Pharma, but now they want to legally have all that and have full control of the name of your safety, track you in live time with an app on your phone as well, which is all here.
[00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.409]  That's right.
[00:25:46.030 --> 00:26:01.536]  Furthermore, these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients, those in high-risk populations, including those with other underlying health conditions, making it increasingly difficult to determine the extent to which these symptoms are associated with vaccination.
[00:26:01.636 --> 00:26:03.016]  That's their big game plan, Alex.
[00:26:03.176 --> 00:26:03.817]  It's soft kill.
[00:26:03.877 --> 00:26:04.637]  It does it down the road.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.063]  It's to be able to know for whoever received the vaccine or maybe your mom or your child received it.
[00:26:11.263 --> 00:26:13.744]  And you can't put two and two together because you already have autism.
[00:26:13.764 --> 00:26:14.905]  You already have Alzheimer's.
[00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:19.007]  All the marketing is if you have pre-existing conditions, take the vaccine.
[00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:20.488]  That's what we see every day on.
[00:26:20.768 --> 00:26:22.409]  And then it accelerates and it kills you quicker.
[00:26:22.469 --> 00:26:22.910]  Continue.
[00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.571]  They're getting rid of the useless cedars.
[00:26:24.911 --> 00:26:26.272]  Like Bill Gates said, kill granny.
[00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:30.175]  They have Dutch TV saying kill autistic children.
[00:26:30.816 --> 00:26:32.056]  Kill Down Syndrome children.
[00:26:32.076 --> 00:26:32.437]  Continue.
[00:26:32.837 --> 00:26:33.417]  Hold on one second.
[00:26:33.437 --> 00:26:40.983]  If you read that article about Hank Aaron that Robert F. Kennedy wrote, he says it's really hard to correlate vaccine damage
[00:26:42.324 --> 00:26:43.244]  To a dead person.
[00:26:43.264 --> 00:26:45.025]  It's hard to see these signs.
[00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:49.246]  It doesn't just pop right out actually saying, oh look, here's the red spot that appears on the brain.
[00:26:49.486 --> 00:26:50.186]  It's not like that.
[00:26:50.247 --> 00:26:51.947]  So can you imagine two years later?
[00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:52.887]  How are you going to figure that out?
[00:26:53.287 --> 00:26:58.449]  It's going to be hard for these parents to even say or prove that their kid had this issue.
[00:26:58.489 --> 00:26:59.349]  And that's what Bill Gates said.
[00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:01.850]  He said, this will kill or hurt 700,000 people.
[00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.111]  But he said, we've got to have it really strong so some people get hurt up front.
[00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:08.672]  Because it's got to be so strong to kill you down the road, that's going to be a little bit obvious up front.
[00:27:08.712 --> 00:27:10.093]  You're going to go to the slides in a moment.
[00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:10.773]  Keep going.
[00:27:10.993 --> 00:27:12.074]  I mean this gets worse, Alex.
[00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:21.580]  Severe side effects including swollen legs, severe joint pain, and encephalitis potentially resulting in seizures, seizure disorders, or death occasionally occurred.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.481]  Word for word from the document.
[00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:25.082]  Everything now happening in Mass.
[00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:26.723]  We gotta add all the B-roll to that.
[00:27:26.743 --> 00:27:27.384]  That's okay.
[00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:43.920]  In an effort to further reach certain population subgroups, agency officials enlisted the help of well-known scientists, celebrities, and government officials to make short videos and zap clips, which is a type of social media exercise, and in a few cases, give interviews to major media outlets.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.061]  We cover this every day, Alex.
[00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:45.942]  We see it all the time.
[00:27:46.618 --> 00:27:47.038]  Keep going.
[00:27:47.959 --> 00:28:01.191]  Among those chosen were former president, and in this exercise her name is Jacqueline Bennett, BZ, a popular hip-hop star, and Paul Farmer, co-founder of Partners in Health and a renowned global health expert.
[00:28:01.211 --> 00:28:02.492]  Who's essentially like the Bill Gates.
[00:28:02.732 --> 00:28:04.654]  Yeah, and that Run DMC clip which we have.
[00:28:05.655 --> 00:28:12.919]  That's what they're talking about, hiring these hip-hop people, hiring the people that are celebrities that you already trust, you already know them for the last 15-20 years.
[00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:15.040]  Now they're promoting the vaccine on TV.
[00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:26.167]  ASPR recommended to HHS Secretary Nagel that SAMHSA collaborate with stakeholders and devise behavioral health guidance
[00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:37.560]  For the states, tribes, and territories on how to strengthen the public's coping skills, provide support for grieving individuals, encourage a forward direction, and meet other SPARs recovery needs.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.662]  Basically what they're doing is what's in California.
[00:28:40.123 --> 00:28:45.128]  If you have a health condition that they can't tie something to, now they send the behavioral health people to your house.
[00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:47.090]  And that's what all these stimulus plans are.
[00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.591]  And so we don't know why you're brain damaged or why you're having convulsions.
[00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:50.931]  You're mentally ill.
[00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:52.792]  We've got drugs for you.
[00:28:53.192 --> 00:28:54.753]  We've got antipsychotics.
[00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:59.655]  We've got these different chemicals, these antidepressants.
[00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:08.799]  And let's show those articles, because remember, Yale got hired to quote, sell us on taking the vaccines and how to respond to the problems the vaccines are going to cause.
[00:29:08.839 --> 00:29:12.161]  I mean, they're on record doing all of this.
[00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:14.922]  They're on record using psychology against the people.
[00:29:15.714 --> 00:29:19.036]  These groups initially came from four primary sources.
[00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:23.078]  They're talking about the people that reject the vaccine, that don't want to get involved in this nightmare.
[00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:30.182]  Muslim groups across the country who oppose the vaccine on the basis that the original formulation was used to treat pigs.
[00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:37.307]  African-Americans who refuse vaccination based on governmental experimentation on African-American populations.
[00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:42.010]  Alternative medicine proponents and anti-vaccination activists.
[00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:46.373]  They already know who's going to reject their plan and they have plans to be able to counter them.
[00:29:46.873 --> 00:29:47.674]  In the document, Alex.
[00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:53.977]  And now you see it all in lockstep today, the exact stuff unfolding that they put in the document.
[00:29:54.378 --> 00:30:09.366]  Conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media, suggesting that the virus had been purposefully created and introduced to the population by drug companies, or that it had escaped from a government lab, secretly testing bioweapons.
[00:30:09.386 --> 00:30:09.767]  Let me have that.
[00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:10.967]  I'm going to read that for people again.
[00:30:10.987 --> 00:30:11.688]  This is directly.
[00:30:12.148 --> 00:30:13.810]  CDC is essentially a drug company, too.
[00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.091]  They own patents on drugs.
[00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:17.053]  Oh, oh, I mean Fauci, Fauci.
[00:30:17.073 --> 00:30:20.736]  So again, these are all just quotes out of the document itself, so they're easier to read.
[00:30:22.878 --> 00:30:34.748]  Conspiracy theories also pervaded across social media, suggesting the virus had been purposely created and introduced to the population by drug companies, or that it had escaped from a government lab, secretly testing bioweapons.
[00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.429]  This is in 2000.
[00:30:37.924 --> 00:30:46.526]  And 17, right after Fauci says a virus will be released, it's going to happen, it's going to challenge Trump, it's going to be a surprise operation.
[00:30:47.586 --> 00:31:01.649]  And you can put on screen for folks the article, ladies and gentlemen, out of Newsweek, Fauci did controversial gain-of-function viral testing at the Wuhan lab.
[00:31:02.622 --> 00:31:07.285]  Because they knew they moved this there from Chapel Hill in 2015, North Carolina.
[00:31:07.525 --> 00:31:15.570]  There were big scientific articles in the mainstream news that what they were doing was a bioweapon, huge gain of function, playing with cold viruses, that they shouldn't be doing it.
[00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:21.054]  And then they put out a document, even knowing people would counter them, knowing they cooked it up in Wuhan.
[00:31:21.494 --> 00:31:22.455]  And how to go after him.
[00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:23.935]  Absolutely insane.
[00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:26.837]  Quickly now, because I need to get to the actual slides.
[00:31:27.297 --> 00:31:28.398]  We've only scratched the surface here.
[00:31:28.418 --> 00:31:28.858]  Look at all this.
[00:31:28.878 --> 00:31:30.399]  This is all documentation here, folks.
[00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:32.160]  We haven't gotten through one document yet.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.980]  Read the rest of that.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.941]  This is just the summary.
[00:31:33.961 --> 00:31:36.622]  We're just trying to give you guys the overall basis of this.
[00:31:36.902 --> 00:31:37.843]  All the little details.
[00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:39.664]  This took me two weeks to read, by the way.
[00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:43.946]  The wording, it weaves everything together, so you're like, what is going on?
[00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:45.127]  Is this an exercise?
[00:31:45.187 --> 00:31:45.707]  Is this real?
[00:31:46.227 --> 00:31:48.648]  I was just trying to do the best I can to extract everything.
[00:31:48.728 --> 00:31:50.989]  So if you have five minutes, you can just understand what's happening.
[00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:52.669]  Here you go.
[00:31:52.949 --> 00:32:01.932]  On July 9th, 2026, a week before Corovax was released for distribution in the United States, the power grid at the Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington state
[00:32:02.392 --> 00:32:03.552]  They're showing off to their people.
[00:32:03.572 --> 00:32:03.992]  Keep going.
[00:32:31.658 --> 00:32:40.123]  The real, the very real possibility of a future sparse pandemic necessitate continued commitment to vaccination programs.
[00:32:40.143 --> 00:32:44.385]  So inside the exercise, it says this is done after three years of the initial outbreak.
[00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:47.147]  It says you're going to need vaccines forever.
[00:32:47.227 --> 00:32:52.630]  Future outbreaks will continue to emerge unless countries maintain widespread vaccination
[00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.132]  And so we're going to release something new on you if you don't submit.
[00:32:55.192 --> 00:32:56.734]  We can Trojan horse wherever we want into it.
[00:32:57.054 --> 00:32:58.996]  And you're like, yeah, we see this on the news every day.
[00:32:59.296 --> 00:33:04.421]  This is from four years ago with Fauci and John Hopkins and Bill Gates and Bloomberg now happening.
[00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.383]  OK, let's start moving quick now.
[00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:06.804]  Great job.
[00:33:07.064 --> 00:33:08.585]  All right, Rob, let's now move.
[00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:19.344]  From those highlights to the actual screenshots of the document, the Spars Pandemic 2025-2028, which is actually real-time, starting 2020, right now.
[00:33:19.765 --> 00:33:22.607]  Let's go ahead and, as you go, I'll flip through this.
[00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:22.848]  Sure.
[00:33:23.048 --> 00:33:24.169]  Overhead shot here, please.
[00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:28.794]  So if you go to the first slide, this was done in October 2017, which we've covered.
[00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:31.657]  It precedes Event 201 and Crimson Contagion.
[00:33:31.997 --> 00:33:37.078]  Which are two exercises that are sort of the getting people organized and getting ready for this.
[00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:38.618]  This was done by Johns Hopkins.
[00:33:39.138 --> 00:33:46.360]  You go to the next one, Johns Hopkins is also in charge of Event 201 with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.360]  And that's all the main globalist eugenicist leaders.
[00:33:50.221 --> 00:33:54.981]  We have Klaus Schwab saying this is to stop carbon, this is to depopulate, this is to save the earth.
[00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:57.162]  I'll show you all those articles, mainstream news.
[00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:58.462]  You'll have nothing.
[00:33:58.502 --> 00:33:59.183]  You'll own nothing.
[00:33:59.223 --> 00:33:59.703]  You'll love it.
[00:33:59.983 --> 00:34:01.264]  And it's all the same group.
[00:34:01.344 --> 00:34:07.127]  It all runs through John Hopkins that gives the orders to the UN, the WHO, the NIH, all of it.
[00:34:07.368 --> 00:34:07.748]  Continue.
[00:34:08.008 --> 00:34:08.208]  All right.
[00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:13.751]  If we go to the next one, the name SARS-CoV-2 is the actual name of the COVID virus.
[00:34:14.132 --> 00:34:16.433]  Well, here in the exercise, go one more page, Alex.
[00:34:16.693 --> 00:34:19.875]  And so we see Bill and Melinda Gates also being involved with Johns Hopkins doing this.
[00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:22.417]  Now let's go to the next slide, and we look at the name.
[00:34:22.858 --> 00:34:24.379]  So of course they come up with the name, St.
[00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:29.122]  Paul Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which is what you do when you have a virus, you say where it came from.
[00:34:29.462 --> 00:34:32.965]  So SPARS-COV, which stands for coronavirus.
[00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:37.968]  Now we have our virus here, which originated from Wuhan, they call it SARS-COVID-2.
[00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:40.090]  Almost the same exact name.
[00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.051]  How did they predict that?
[00:34:41.111 --> 00:34:48.717]  Well, we know, we've seen SARS-CoV-2 listed in other documents, they were finding it in the sewage a few years before this outbreak.
[00:34:48.757 --> 00:34:49.058]  In Europe.
[00:34:49.098 --> 00:34:51.019]  Yeah, so this thing's been around for a while.
[00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:53.161]  There's already an IMF World Bank documents in 2018, 2019.
[00:34:53.541 --> 00:35:03.129]  So they cooked it up at Wuhan, they give it the same damn name basically in their drill, when Fauci says a mystery disease is about to come out and challenge Trump, and then it's basically the same name.
[00:35:03.209 --> 00:35:04.310]  Look at that again, that is incredible.
[00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:04.651]  There it is.
[00:35:05.251 --> 00:35:10.172]  And so, let's go to the next slide, where we have the inflated fatality estimates.
[00:35:10.853 --> 00:35:15.674]  Okay, CDC came out with, and this is with SPARS, and they said, oh, we're looking at a 4.7% fatality rate.
[00:35:15.694 --> 00:35:17.214]  WHO said 14% under 64, and then 50% over 64.
[00:35:17.654 --> 00:35:18.755]  This is going to be huge.
[00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:24.196]  Kill a lot of people.
[00:35:42.706 --> 00:35:44.947]  And then they admit they're giving us fake numbers right here.
[00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:45.147]  Yeah.
[00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:46.328]  And then how to counter that later.
[00:35:46.368 --> 00:35:47.208]  This is incredible.
[00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:47.749]  Exactly.
[00:35:47.769 --> 00:35:48.889]  They go over the same scenario.
[00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:53.091]  So the actual, once the exercise is done, they go, oh, it was only 0.06 death rate.
[00:35:53.472 --> 00:35:55.233]  And then you look at what happened with COVID.
[00:35:55.393 --> 00:35:59.455]  Imperial College came out and said 2.2 million people are going to die in the U.S.
[00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:01.236]  and 510, over half a million in the U.K.
[00:36:01.616 --> 00:36:04.137]  And the WHO said the fatality rate is going to be 2% worldwide.
[00:36:04.577 --> 00:36:04.837]  Okay.
[00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:06.418]  But then you look at what actually happened.
[00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:08.259]  What are the actual numbers of COVID?
[00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:09.060]  0 to 19, 0.003%.
[00:36:12.962 --> 00:36:15.143]  20 to 49.02 percent.
[00:36:16.103 --> 00:36:16.723]  50 to 69.
[00:36:16.783 --> 00:36:18.864]  We start finally getting into some death rates.
[00:36:18.924 --> 00:36:21.145]  Go to the next slide, guys.
[00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:22.086]  0.5 percent.
[00:36:22.486 --> 00:36:23.446]  Half a percentage rate.
[00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:23.886]  There it is.
[00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:27.068]  70 plus years, 5.4 percent.
[00:36:27.088 --> 00:36:37.672]  So you do see some deaths in the older 70s, but that's when they were bringing people into the nursing homes, they were trying to kill as many people as possible, and then they were giving those people ventilators.
[00:36:37.692 --> 00:36:39.033]  So that... Let's slow down.
[00:36:39.053 --> 00:36:39.673]  There you see that.
[00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:41.394]  Yeah.
[00:37:00.007 --> 00:37:06.914]  Add that right here because that is in-fricken-credible and it goes on and on because it's all BS numbers.
[00:37:07.234 --> 00:37:08.115]  It's all made up.
[00:37:08.255 --> 00:37:09.076]  It's all scripted.
[00:37:09.296 --> 00:37:10.097]  Who even knows?
[00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:10.958]  Let's explain.
[00:37:11.178 --> 00:37:13.100]  They don't just have their fake number at the start.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.124]  They have another fake number later to control this whole thing.
[00:37:17.284 --> 00:37:18.125]  Yep, exactly.
[00:37:18.445 --> 00:37:23.512]  And you can even find that on the CDC, because they even write in there that 6% of these people only died from COVID.
[00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:26.776]  Of all the deaths we've had, only 6% actually died from just COVID.
[00:37:26.796 --> 00:37:29.179]  Everybody else had comorbidities, at least 2.
[00:37:29.459 --> 00:37:32.223]  I think it was 2.6 comorbidities was the average.
[00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.244]  By the way, Rob, let's just start completely over.
[00:37:34.284 --> 00:37:35.244]  Let's go back to the very beginning.
[00:37:35.264 --> 00:37:36.285]  This is so powerful.
[00:37:36.685 --> 00:37:37.646]  This is so incredible.
[00:37:37.846 --> 00:37:38.786]  And it gets even worse, folks.
[00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:39.267]  Look at all this.
[00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.167]  We read all this.
[00:37:40.547 --> 00:37:41.748]  Every bit of this is just as bad.
[00:37:41.988 --> 00:37:43.149]  They're admitting they're killing you.
[00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:45.310]  They're admitting it's world government to get rid of your family.
[00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.591]  They're admitting you'll all be brain damaged, dying soon.
[00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:55.795]  I mean, imagine knowing this, and then they're censoring us all so we can't warn people, and Google employees are going to get the shots themselves and will be dead in two years.
[00:37:56.216 --> 00:37:56.936]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:37:56.956 --> 00:37:57.496]  So start over.
[00:37:57.716 --> 00:37:58.837]  Here is their own document.
[00:37:59.117 --> 00:37:59.858]  Just read it, Rob.
[00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:01.178]  We'll start again.
[00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.140]  Spars pandemic 2025-2028.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.902]  As you say, you can make it 2020 to 2023 because that's what's going on.
[00:38:07.843 --> 00:38:09.104]  The event date is preceded.
[00:38:09.324 --> 00:38:10.845]  Event 201 in Crimson Contagion.
[00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:11.685]  This is the daddy.
[00:38:11.765 --> 00:38:14.207]  The Spars is the daddy of what's going on now.
[00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:15.628]  That's it right there.
[00:38:15.688 --> 00:38:16.529]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:38:16.569 --> 00:38:19.331]  Run by John Hopkins, the World Health Organization.
[00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:21.072]  No, that's World Economic Forum.
[00:38:21.092 --> 00:38:22.333]  That's World Economic Forum.
[00:38:22.353 --> 00:38:23.553]  That's Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:38:23.874 --> 00:38:24.574]  These are the people.
[00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:30.318]  It's Schwab and Gates who are running this thing with the scientist brain bugs in Johns Hopkins, who've been planning this stuff for years.
[00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:31.519]  It's crazy.
[00:38:31.939 --> 00:38:32.740]  Let's go to the next one.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.581]  You look at the similarity to the names.
[00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:36.242]  Spars, COVID.
[00:38:37.183 --> 00:38:38.344]  And then we have SARS-CoV-2.
[00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:39.911]  Okay.
[00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.192]  Same, almost same exact name.
[00:38:42.232 --> 00:38:44.532]  And they wrote this three or four years before.
[00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:51.114]  They added a number and they just added a P. Exactly.
[00:38:51.254 --> 00:38:52.054]  It's really crazy.
[00:38:52.354 --> 00:38:54.555]  Then we have the inflated fatality estimates.
[00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:58.635]  Initially, they write in the scenario, CDC fatality rate, almost 5%.
[00:38:58.716 --> 00:38:59.336]  WHO fatality rate, 14.5%.
[00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:01.136]  And then the fatality rate of over 64 is 50%.
[00:39:05.277 --> 00:39:07.780]  Oh, but when we actually get to it and we look at the numbers, it's only .06%.
[00:39:09.562 --> 00:39:10.823]  Not even half a percent.
[00:39:11.184 --> 00:39:11.985]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:39:12.005 --> 00:39:12.165]  That's .06%.
[00:39:12.385 --> 00:39:14.247]  That's not even a full percentage point.
[00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:18.212]  And then you look at the inflated estimates from Imperial College.
[00:39:19.013 --> 00:39:20.635]  2.2 million people were going to die.
[00:39:21.055 --> 00:39:20.635]  510.
[00:39:21.315 --> 00:39:22.557]  That freaked everybody out.
[00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:24.859]  And the WHO said it was going to be a 2% fatality rate.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.886]  Well, we come back and it's barely anybody dying from this, unless you're over 70 and you have comorbidities.
[00:39:31.206 --> 00:39:35.250]  And only 6% of people who died from this actually just died of COVID-19.
[00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.250]  6%.
[00:39:36.812 --> 00:39:39.675]  And three years later, the New York Times said only 6% actually died of it.
[00:39:39.895 --> 00:39:40.355]  Exactly.
[00:39:40.556 --> 00:39:41.036]  Continuing.
[00:39:41.437 --> 00:39:41.637]  All right.
[00:39:43.266 --> 00:39:43.746]  One more, guys.
[00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:44.606]  Skip to the next one.
[00:39:45.366 --> 00:39:55.869]  So, SPARS emerges 2025, and then January 2026, as October 2025, January 2026, the government contracts with SinBio to produce the SPARS vaccine.
[00:39:55.889 --> 00:39:56.789]  So, that's four months.
[00:39:57.329 --> 00:40:00.830]  Now, here we have December 31st, COVID-19 is identified.
[00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.670]  That's the date they give as identifying COVID-19.
[00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.311]  April 2020, U.S.
[00:40:05.331 --> 00:40:07.171]  government launches Operation Warp Speed.
[00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:11.272]  They're giving money to vaccine companies to create the vaccine.
[00:40:11.852 --> 00:40:16.695]  And they don't call it warp speed here, they call it a similar name, but it's the exact same thing to speed it up.
[00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.036]  Exactly.
[00:40:18.056 --> 00:40:19.897]  Which means giving them unlimited power.
[00:40:20.177 --> 00:40:20.898]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:40:20.978 --> 00:40:23.059]  And it's all underdone on this emergency authorization.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.801]  Everything's emergency authorizations, they can do pretty much anything they want.
[00:40:25.861 --> 00:40:27.462]  And then they lie and go, it's approved by the FDA, it's tested.
[00:40:27.502 --> 00:40:27.902]  No, it's not.
[00:40:28.023 --> 00:40:28.363]  It's not.
[00:40:28.683 --> 00:40:36.048]  It's only approved for emergency authorization, which means you don't have anything else that could work with this, which is why they got rid of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[00:40:36.328 --> 00:40:38.269]  Anyway, let's go to the antivirals.
[00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:38.990]  This is the next slide.
[00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.231]  In this scenario, they have one called KALOSIVIR.
[00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:44.512]  All right?
[00:40:44.972 --> 00:40:45.792]  Ends in an IR.
[00:40:46.212 --> 00:40:48.733]  Side effects, nausea, headaches, vomiting, and body aches.
[00:40:48.753 --> 00:40:54.776]  There's actually a viral video of a boy in this scenario taking the KALOSIVIR and then immediately projectile vomiting everywhere.
[00:40:54.856 --> 00:40:56.396]  Yeah, they even have videos of their scenario.
[00:40:57.016 --> 00:40:57.316]  It's crazy.
[00:40:57.336 --> 00:41:01.038]  And then, if we go back to it, then three years later, it's REMDESIVIR!
[00:41:01.698 --> 00:41:03.400]  Look, and this is not the real name.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.121]  This is the name they gave it later.
[00:41:05.582 --> 00:41:11.947]  It's actually got a different name that they, that it's... I remember they said remdesivir was this new experimental thing they just developed.
[00:41:12.047 --> 00:41:12.247]  Exactly.
[00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:14.169]  But they had the damn name three years before.
[00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:15.450]  Same side effects.
[00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.451]  Nausea, constipation, vomiting.
[00:41:16.491 --> 00:41:17.472]  They only changed a few letters.
[00:41:17.532 --> 00:41:18.813]  It's all about rubbing in their faces.
[00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:19.254]  It is.
[00:41:19.434 --> 00:41:20.154]  They really do.
[00:41:20.174 --> 00:41:22.456]  Folks, this is smoking gun.
[00:41:23.226 --> 00:41:23.867]  Okay, keep going.
[00:41:24.027 --> 00:41:24.227]  All right.
[00:41:24.508 --> 00:41:28.413]  After antivirals, we have the massive power outage that Michael was talking about earlier.
[00:41:28.733 --> 00:41:34.180]  Ten months into the pandemic, right as they're starting the vaccine rollout, the Pacific Northwest has a two-week blackout.
[00:41:34.841 --> 00:41:35.101]  Okay?
[00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:36.463]  Go to the next slide, guys.
[00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:36.964]  There you go.
[00:41:37.524 --> 00:41:40.468]  COVID-19, 13 months into the pandemic.
[00:41:41.283 --> 00:41:45.746]  And two months into the vaccine rollout, Texas has a one-week, some spots it was a two-week blackout.
[00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:53.191]  Texas is about the same size, if you throw it up there, as Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho.
[00:41:53.231 --> 00:41:55.253]  You stick Texas up there, it's about the same size.
[00:41:55.273 --> 00:41:55.953]  I've learned their tricks.
[00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:10.202]  Obama said for three years as the head of the Harvard Law Review that he was born in Kenya, so we would say he was born in Kenya, not Hawaii, to the famous porn director communist, Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:42:10.502 --> 00:42:12.244]  So they do that to rub it in further.
[00:42:12.264 --> 00:42:13.666]  So we focus on that.
[00:42:13.686 --> 00:42:14.487]  They'll only focus on that later.
[00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:21.852]  Not that they had the Remdesivir name drug the same and all the other stuff exactly the same.
[00:42:21.912 --> 00:42:22.992]  That's their little side.
[00:42:23.012 --> 00:42:23.813]  I mean, I've learned how they work.
[00:42:23.873 --> 00:42:24.413]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:25.634]  They even do that kind of stuff.
[00:42:25.694 --> 00:42:26.854]  It's their juicy, as you like to say.
[00:42:26.894 --> 00:42:28.795]  It's their little juicy to go, ha, look what we did.
[00:42:28.995 --> 00:42:29.915]  We were able to cause this.
[00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:33.977]  Now let's look at the vaccine propaganda tech campaign that they're going to roll out.
[00:42:34.317 --> 00:42:42.821]  So with Spars, they go with big tech, celebrities, the president, which they talk about the president coming out and giving statements, a hip hop star named BZ.
[00:42:43.801 --> 00:42:48.803]  Uh, mainstream media and a global health expert who were akin to Bill Gates, as you mentioned earlier.
[00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:49.943]  Now, look at COVID-19.
[00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:52.324]  We had the four presidents come out and talk about getting the vaccine.
[00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:53.624]  We've got John Legend.
[00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.764]  We've got Run DMC.
[00:42:55.044 --> 00:42:55.885]  We've got Bill Gates.
[00:42:55.905 --> 00:42:56.925]  We've got Ryan Reynolds.
[00:42:56.965 --> 00:42:58.686]  And we're going to show you all these tweets in a second.
[00:42:59.026 --> 00:43:01.746]  Dr. Fauci, MSM, and the Surgeon General.
[00:43:02.007 --> 00:43:06.448]  The Surgeon General is using the same hashtags as that are written in this scenario.
[00:43:07.455 --> 00:43:09.337]  That's going to freak you out in a second, Jones.
[00:43:09.617 --> 00:43:11.318]  The same exact hashtags.
[00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:11.919]  We're going to show that.
[00:43:11.939 --> 00:43:12.760]  That's why I'm telling you.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.600]  You're doing a great job.
[00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:16.963]  I'm frustrated because we literally have only got into two documents.
[00:43:16.983 --> 00:43:19.966]  There's over 20 documents left and over 100 news articles.
[00:43:20.146 --> 00:43:20.946]  We'll go to the next one.
[00:43:21.007 --> 00:43:22.748]  Now this is where the censorship takes place.
[00:43:23.028 --> 00:43:24.109]  Medical countermeasures.
[00:43:24.129 --> 00:43:24.650]  That's what they call it.
[00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:25.811]  They don't call it censorship.
[00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:27.532]  They call it MCM.
[00:43:27.552 --> 00:43:29.954]  So you're going to see that acronym all throughout this document.
[00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:30.555]  MCM.
[00:43:30.755 --> 00:43:31.135]  MCM.
[00:43:31.435 --> 00:43:33.357]  It's like, how do we, how do we deal with this scenario?
[00:43:33.557 --> 00:43:34.638]  Somebody mentions Tuskegee.
[00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.059]  How do we combat it?
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.824]  Uh, somebody says, Oh, I don't like how the Muslim thing with, with the pigs have it being associated with pigs.
[00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:44.006]  Oh, so they built all these scenarios in.
[00:43:44.046 --> 00:43:51.273]  So they have the folders and the, and the suggestions in here written for the people to then say, Oh, well, don't worry about that.
[00:43:51.553 --> 00:43:52.534]  We're not using pigs.
[00:43:52.594 --> 00:43:53.915]  Pigs weren't used in this version.
[00:43:54.295 --> 00:43:59.140]  Oh, we have a black lady working on the vaccine and they do it in that nice soft voice that gets everybody.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:05.586]  And let's just pause for a moment and get Mike Halpern's comment on this and yours as well, Rob, because this is very upsetting.
[00:44:06.466 --> 00:44:08.688]  This is all important, but them calling it
[00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:13.213]  SARS versus the other name that's just two letters change.
[00:44:13.754 --> 00:44:18.599]  Them having the drug be the same name that they claim was a brand new drug that just came out.
[00:44:18.759 --> 00:44:18.939]  Yeah.
[00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:19.640]  All of that.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:27.789]  And then as you said, the tweets where they put it all out as a drill and they use the same hashtags later show it's a blueprint and a battle plan.
[00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:29.530]  I mean, this is mind blowing.
[00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:31.421]  It really is disgusting.
[00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:34.044]  Now let's go to, so the medical countermeasures.
[00:44:34.445 --> 00:44:42.696]  If you read this, there's several sections and appendices that are voted just to deal with the public pushback, the changing of the guidelines where we had 14 days to stop the spread.
[00:44:42.716 --> 00:44:43.937]  Yeah, you may have heard of this before.
[00:44:43.957 --> 00:44:45.860]  14 days to stop the spread.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.401]  Exactly.
[00:44:48.158 --> 00:44:50.679]  They say no mask, then yes mask.
[00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:52.580]  You wonder, where do they come up with all this?
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.103]  They even change their minds and do all this to make it look real.
[00:44:57.523 --> 00:45:00.665]  We got new information.
[00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:02.847]  New information's come to light, as the dude once said.
[00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.508]  And it's like you said, we're all living this.
[00:45:04.548 --> 00:45:05.368]  Yeah, no, we are.
[00:45:05.648 --> 00:45:08.810]  And as you see it, as you start reading this, you're like, oh my God, this is happening now.
[00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.111]  Oh my God, this happened last week.
[00:45:10.151 --> 00:45:11.272]  Oh my God, this was last year.
[00:45:11.672 --> 00:45:13.613]  As you read this document, that's what I was going through.
[00:45:13.633 --> 00:45:14.654]  And it's in the same order.
[00:45:15.518 --> 00:45:15.998]  It's crazy.
[00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:16.479]  It's crazy.
[00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:20.962]  And we're supposed to be puppets living through their little Shakespearean death play.
[00:45:21.142 --> 00:45:25.165]  Well, Klaus Schwab says we're merging our physical... Oh yeah, it's all merging together.
[00:45:25.265 --> 00:45:25.885]  One virtual reality.
[00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:36.813]  And so that's what it is, is they've created a giant play that's reality, and then we're all supposed to conform or we get censored and blacklisted, but if we play along with it and become robots, then we live.
[00:45:36.893 --> 00:45:39.734]  You're either in their virtual reality, or you're censored.
[00:45:40.034 --> 00:45:41.415]  It's a SimCity, yeah, definitely.
[00:45:41.635 --> 00:45:41.955]  Definitely.
[00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:42.675]  And what have they done?
[00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:49.858]  They bring on doctors, they censor doctors that are talking about this, they have massive deplatforming, which we've already seen, it's happening now, even today.
[00:45:50.218 --> 00:45:53.159]  Just the fact that they were taking doctors off talking about this,
[00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:57.763]  Medical doctors who are working, practicing medicine, they take off their videos.
[00:45:58.104 --> 00:45:59.885]  And how many of those videos did we put on Banned.Video?
[00:46:00.085 --> 00:46:02.588]  We probably don't even have half of what has been taken off.
[00:46:02.932 --> 00:46:04.413]  Because they just keep removing and removing.
[00:46:04.433 --> 00:46:06.654]  And again, it's all premeditated.
[00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:07.354]  Let's continue.
[00:46:07.914 --> 00:46:09.335]  Well, let's just finish with this here.
[00:46:09.955 --> 00:46:12.036]  Using fact-check organizations to debunk things.
[00:46:12.056 --> 00:46:14.217]  This is a medical countermeasure that's going on.
[00:46:14.337 --> 00:46:15.417]  Run by Bill Gates!
[00:46:15.517 --> 00:46:16.518]  Run by Big Pharma!
[00:46:16.658 --> 00:46:24.441]  That's why you see when you type in something about somebody dying from the vaccine, there's 15 fact-check articles before you get to anything that's even a news article.
[00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:27.443]  And it's because they've already war-gamed this out back in 2017.
[00:46:27.903 --> 00:46:28.744]  They know what they're going to do.
[00:46:28.804 --> 00:46:30.985]  So Bill Gates had the fact-check orgs step up.
[00:46:31.326 --> 00:46:32.266]  Facebook hires them.
[00:46:32.847 --> 00:46:33.747]  Twitter looks at them.
[00:46:33.827 --> 00:46:34.388]  No, no, no, no.
[00:46:34.468 --> 00:46:35.148]  It's worse than that.
[00:46:35.268 --> 00:46:37.850]  Wuhan runs the COVID-19 fact-checking.
[00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:38.191]  Yes.
[00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:39.952]  They create what you're supposed to go on.
[00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:41.913]  That's a former Facebook employee.
[00:46:42.233 --> 00:46:44.855]  The former Facebook employee works in the COVID-19 area.
[00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.157]  Dr. Daniel Anderson.
[00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:47.677]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:48.778]  You can't make it up.
[00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:53.983]  And then of course you've got CNN and MSNBC and all these places pushing the vaccine, pushing the narrative.
[00:46:54.323 --> 00:47:02.290]  And then you have on top of that, inside these things, Big Pharma's making these ads that aren't really ads, but they're at, like, Pfizer's the biggest spender of all these people.
[00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.732]  If you look at what Pfizer's doing, they're just going, they're making these things going, look.
[00:47:05.853 --> 00:47:09.756]  And so Big Pharma fact checkers then debunk you.
[00:47:09.996 --> 00:47:10.196]  Yeah.
[00:47:10.456 --> 00:47:12.078]  Big Pharma ads, government narrative.
[00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:15.880]  Debunk anything against government narrative, continue.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.903]  Yeah, and then you have the native ads which are put out by the vaccine companies saying the vaccine is safe and effective.
[00:47:21.443 --> 00:47:22.243]  And that's all they do.
[00:47:22.504 --> 00:47:29.548]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is a remarkable product and it's back in stock 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:31.609]  It's always been one of our top ten bestsellers.

[00:48:01.844 --> 00:48:03.285]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[00:48:03.525 --> 00:48:04.665]  We tried to put it in a bigger order.
[00:48:04.725 --> 00:48:05.686]  We couldn't even get it.
[00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:08.287]  Because getting high quality ingredients is very, very hard.
[00:48:08.807 --> 00:48:11.348]  Now, I want to be as serious as a heart attack with everybody for a moment.
[00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:12.289]  Yes, they overblew COVID.
[00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:13.009]  Yes, they hyped it up.
[00:48:13.049 --> 00:48:15.210]  Yes, they cooked it up in a lab, but it's so they can own it.
[00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.831]  It is synthetic and they can roll out new versions.
[00:48:36.874 --> 00:48:39.555]  This isn't like a Chevy, you know, gets better with time or whatever.
[00:48:40.376 --> 00:48:41.336]  It gets worse with time.
[00:48:41.897 --> 00:48:43.698]  You see Brazil, what they're being hit with.
[00:48:44.658 --> 00:48:47.860]  Clearly, Bill Gates has said, oh, this is just a drill.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.881]  He said that on national TV last year.
[00:48:50.281 --> 00:48:52.602]  Terrorists are going to release a bioweapon, it's going to be really bad.
[00:48:52.862 --> 00:49:01.087]  And now all these insider globalists, they're in these white papers all over the news saying, oh, a really bad version or other stuff's coming for sure, just like Fauci said.
[00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:10.866]  So this has all just been a drill to get us ready, and I believe they're going to launch other bio-attacks to cover all the sickness and illness that the vaccines themselves are going to cause.
[00:49:10.886 --> 00:49:13.207]  And that's even what NPR admits would top scientists.
[00:49:13.228 --> 00:49:14.048]  I couldn't believe it was on there.
[00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:16.030]  We already had scientists on that said the same thing a year ago.
[00:49:17.267 --> 00:49:17.547]  This is
[00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:36.272]  If we don't stay closed.
[00:49:36.332 --> 00:49:37.753]  So, it's an economic weapon.
[00:49:37.813 --> 00:49:39.174]  It vertically integrates the economy.
[00:49:39.515 --> 00:49:40.756]  It bankrupts little people.
[00:49:41.136 --> 00:49:42.657]  It gives the central systems control.
[00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:44.679]  Much of the world's under martial law.
[00:49:45.039 --> 00:49:48.102]  But finally, once you struggle out of it, they go, oh, really?
[00:49:48.722 --> 00:49:50.464]  You didn't like 110 to 1% dying?
[00:49:50.484 --> 00:49:51.945]  Here's something that does kill 5%.
[00:49:52.205 --> 00:49:53.746]  And I'm predicting that's coming next.
[00:49:54.347 --> 00:49:56.569]  So, you want to talk about that, Mike Halpern?
[00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:59.231]  And then we'll get Rob Dues' take on this.
[00:50:02.884 --> 00:50:08.445]  I mean, basically what I'm seeing in just a general picture, Alex, is that right now they're just making money.
[00:50:08.745 --> 00:50:10.066]  Their industry was dying.
[00:50:10.926 --> 00:50:14.507]  And a lot of people were waking up, getting inside of these Facebook groups, talking to each other.
[00:50:14.567 --> 00:50:17.548]  Hey, I think my kid got autism from this vaccine.
[00:50:17.988 --> 00:50:19.148]  Let's not take that vaccine.
[00:50:19.168 --> 00:50:21.349]  That Vax documentary came out with Del Bigtree.
[00:50:21.389 --> 00:50:24.569]  A lot of people were waking up to the fact that these vaccines are really hurting people.
[00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:26.230]  And people were talking to each other.
[00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:27.750]  We had the U.N.
[00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.551]  December of 2019 when you showed those articles.
[00:50:32.437 --> 00:50:36.638]  Yeah, people were really talking to each other and saying, maybe it's best that I don't get my kid vaccinated.
[00:50:36.658 --> 00:50:37.859]  Maybe I should homeschool.
[00:50:38.279 --> 00:50:41.439]  Maybe we should take a step in a different direction in regards to vaccines.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.541]  That's not an option for a trillion dollar vaccine business.
[00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:48.941]  And because they're losing so much money, they had to launch something, Alex.
[00:50:49.241 --> 00:50:52.402]  They had to get something going that everyone would just comply.
[00:50:52.862 --> 00:50:57.284]  And even when you're a child and your mother brings you into the doctor to get a vaccine, they're scared.
[00:50:57.444 --> 00:50:58.524]  They're scared of
[00:50:59.164 --> 00:50:59.304]  Yes.
[00:51:15.675 --> 00:51:17.577]  Based on the document, I wouldn't hesitate to think that.
[00:51:34.818 --> 00:51:36.739]  The flu vaccines never work.
[00:51:36.959 --> 00:51:38.400]  It's because these things are always mutating.
[00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:39.901]  So it changes over time.
[00:51:40.262 --> 00:51:46.106]  So by injecting this one virus vector into you, and then you come in contact with the disease, you're going to create something different.
[00:51:46.566 --> 00:51:49.468]  And there's no proving that this won't happen.
[00:51:49.888 --> 00:51:52.370]  And when this does happen, they've already got a plan for it.
[00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.951]  So we have basically a six-month timeline.
[00:51:54.971 --> 00:51:58.013]  From right about now, they've been, what, since December, they've been given
[00:51:58.914 --> 00:52:04.316]  Given vaccines, but really the last month or so, they've really amped up how many vaccines they're giving people.
[00:52:04.676 --> 00:52:13.640]  So you're going to see six months from now, six months, maybe five months from now, four months from now, four to six months from now, you're going to see people having really bad side effects.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.582]  They're starting to test this thing on children and pregnant ladies.
[00:52:17.602 --> 00:52:22.264]  We saw the pregnant lady who got one and she had a miscarriage, but she was all for it.
[00:52:22.364 --> 00:52:24.645]  She said it's for our health.
[00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:29.827]  And so then you're going to see the side effects in children happen, because now that's two years down the road.
[00:52:29.887 --> 00:52:33.229]  Well, they're probably not going to start injecting children until the end of this year.
[00:52:33.689 --> 00:52:35.489]  And parents will bring their kids to do this.
[00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.050]  It's crazy.
[00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.551]  I can't believe what they're doing and how people are going along with it.
[00:52:39.611 --> 00:52:43.413]  They really have created the PSYOP mixed in with the lockdown.
[00:52:43.913 --> 00:52:46.794]  So you have people inside their homes looking at TV constantly.
[00:52:47.075 --> 00:52:50.616]  They're being fed the messages and they go, just let me out.
[00:52:50.996 --> 00:52:52.097]  Let me out and I'll do whatever you want.
[00:52:52.157 --> 00:52:53.057]  OK, I'll take a vaccine.
[00:52:53.097 --> 00:52:53.297]  Good.
[00:52:53.357 --> 00:52:53.878]  I can travel.
[00:52:54.118 --> 00:52:54.338]  Great.
[00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:56.500]  They just want to be left alone at this point.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.922]  And since you mentioned that, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:52:59.382 --> 00:53:05.528]  This is CNN medical analyst says it's easier to get people vaccinated when they don't have their freedom.
[00:53:05.548 --> 00:53:10.653]  She says let's keep the lockdown going until they all submit and take the vaccines.
[00:53:10.973 --> 00:53:19.259]  But I think that there are many more people, millions of people, who for whatever reason have concerns about the vaccine, who just don't know what's in it for them.
[00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:24.563]  And we need to make it clear to them that the vaccine is the ticket back to pre-pandemic life.
[00:53:25.023 --> 00:53:26.945]  And the window to do that is really narrowing.
[00:53:27.005 --> 00:53:29.967]  I mean, you were mentioning, Chris, about how all these states are reopening.
[00:53:30.267 --> 00:53:31.088]  They're reopening at 100%.
[00:53:31.128 --> 00:53:37.474]  And we have a very narrow window to tie reopening policy to vaccination status.
[00:53:37.834 --> 00:53:41.538]  Because otherwise, if everything is reopened, then what's the carrot going to be?
[00:53:41.939 --> 00:53:44.521]  How are we going to incentivize people to actually get the vaccine?
[00:53:44.861 --> 00:53:52.409]  So that's why I think the CDC and the Biden administration needs to come out a lot bolder and say, if you're vaccinated, you can do all these things.
[00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.291]  Here are all these freedoms that you have.
[00:53:54.711 --> 00:54:11.271]  Because otherwise, people are going to go out and enjoy these freedoms anyway, and I fear a situation of coming into the fall, where we never reach herd immunity, and then we get hit by the next surge of COVID-19 in the fall, something that we could have prevented if we just got people vaccinated now.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.101]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:14.121 --> 00:54:26.344]  You just saw CNN analysts saying we're basically prisoners under a medical tyranny that has liability protection, that they admit you take this, you're not even protected from these COVID variants, because you can't be protected from the common cold.
[00:54:27.184 --> 00:54:28.225]  It's the perfect takeover.
[00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:34.386]  First, it was five shots a year, and then 10 shots a year, then about 15 shots a year, and liability protection.
[00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:39.648]  But let's put on screen, from January of last year, we're talking 13, 14 months ago,
[00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:42.766]  The U.N.
[00:54:42.786 --> 00:54:43.426]  had a summit.
[00:54:44.867 --> 00:54:47.649]  You can watch the videos there in the article from Banned.Video.
[00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.131]  These are banned on YouTube and Twitter.
[00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:50.932]  You try to show the U.N.
[00:54:50.972 --> 00:54:55.616]  head of vaccines saying they don't protect you, they're killing a bunch of people, and that's banned!
[00:54:56.929 --> 00:55:00.711]  And that's the control that we're talking about that we're going to get to in a moment.
[00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:07.234]  So Rob, I interrupted you because you brought up the fact that they're like, we're going to hold you prisoners, can't get on a plane, can't have a job.
[00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:14.378]  Xi Jinping with the UN admits that they're going to be running the entire program now for the World ID.
[00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:15.639]  I mean, this is a freaking nightmare.
[00:55:15.799 --> 00:55:26.565]  Well, and that was the momentum that was being built by citizen journalists and activists who were showing the studies, showing the antidotes of people having vaccine damage.
[00:55:26.886 --> 00:55:28.467]  We were building all that momentum.
[00:55:28.507 --> 00:55:30.368]  And studies were starting to come out proving it.
[00:55:30.408 --> 00:55:30.588]  Yeah.
[00:55:30.928 --> 00:55:34.511]  And we had people like Robert F. Kennedy who were writing article after article after article about this.
[00:55:34.551 --> 00:55:40.735]  We almost had a presidential symposium, a thought group, where they were going to get together and look at vaccine damage.
[00:55:41.135 --> 00:55:43.197]  And all that stuff got pushed away, pushed aside.
[00:55:43.217 --> 00:55:49.061]  And by the way, you pointed out, Mike, that behind the scenes, Trump, to his credit, was actually killing their globalist programs.
[00:55:49.961 --> 00:55:57.705]  Part of the Crimson Contagion exercise was that Trump was defunding a lot of these different programs at the CDC.
[00:55:57.745 --> 00:55:58.846]  We have an article about that.
[00:55:59.206 --> 00:56:00.727]  He pulled us out of the WHO.
[00:56:01.207 --> 00:56:04.809]  Trump, whether you like Trump or you don't like Trump, Trump just does his own thing.
[00:56:05.169 --> 00:56:06.270]  And they don't like that.
[00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:12.853]  They want to have full control, even in the background, the deep state, all these controllers in the background, they want to run everything.
[00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:18.236]  And so maybe Trump did come out about the vaccine, but in general, Trump was defunding a lot of these programs, Alex.
[00:56:18.556 --> 00:56:20.383]  And I just want to finish one thing on this.
[00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:22.692]  The side effects that we have now that are being reported...
[00:56:23.553 --> 00:56:24.253]  It's the next slide, guys.
[00:56:24.293 --> 00:56:25.074]  Oh, this is the key final slide.
[00:56:25.094 --> 00:56:26.214]  This is the key to everything.
[00:56:26.494 --> 00:56:27.695]  Put up the final slide, please.
[00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:29.356]  The SPARS side effects.
[00:56:29.376 --> 00:56:34.798]  But look, we have 50,000 adverse events that have been reported to VAERS.
[00:56:34.978 --> 00:56:37.820]  2,200 deaths, 7,700 serious injuries.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.420]  Now, there have been studies done.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:43.142]  They think only 1% of these adverse reactions are being reported.
[00:56:43.502 --> 00:56:43.562]  Of 100?
[00:56:43.602 --> 00:56:43.642]  Of 100.
[00:56:43.783 --> 00:56:44.383]  Yeah, only 1%.
[00:56:44.543 --> 00:56:45.543]  We're only getting 1% of those.
[00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:49.625]  What they say is it's between 10 and 100, depending on the culture of the group, the time, the drug.
[00:56:49.805 --> 00:56:50.226]  Exactly.
[00:56:51.586 --> 00:56:53.928]  10 is the low, 100 is the high.
[00:56:54.268 --> 00:56:57.171]  So we're talking 50 times probably more deaths.
[00:56:57.191 --> 00:56:59.172]  Well, Europe admits 4,000 deaths from the vaccine.
[00:56:59.272 --> 00:57:00.934]  Right.
[00:57:00.954 --> 00:57:01.694]  And that's in Europe.
[00:57:01.915 --> 00:57:02.615]  This is just in America.
[00:57:02.635 --> 00:57:04.857]  And by the way, listen folks, here's the good news.
[00:57:04.897 --> 00:57:05.578]  We're not in a vacuum.
[00:57:06.454 --> 00:57:07.614]  All these states are fighting back.
[00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:08.715]  All these courts are fighting back.
[00:57:08.995 --> 00:57:09.635]  You're fighting back.
[00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:12.735]  India, two months ago, banned the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.
[00:57:13.055 --> 00:57:18.897]  South Africa, over 100 countries, 25 in Europe, have banned the AstraZeneca.
[00:57:19.297 --> 00:57:22.198]  But then, oh, the media's like, no one's banned it.
[00:57:22.678 --> 00:57:23.618]  They even have fact-checks.
[00:57:23.698 --> 00:57:24.618]  Jones is wrong.
[00:57:24.738 --> 00:57:26.078]  India didn't ban Pfizer.
[00:57:26.478 --> 00:57:28.699]  So they have these fact-checkers that are lying frauds.
[00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.100]  And they all work for Facebook.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.181]  They're all interconnected.
[00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:33.863]  Bill Gates is heavily invested in Facebook.
[00:57:34.243 --> 00:57:37.506]  He's heavily invested in a lot of these different industries.
[00:57:37.646 --> 00:57:40.528]  And if you just look at them one by one, you can't put the pieces together.
[00:57:40.868 --> 00:57:47.834]  But if you step back and see all of his investments, you're going to see they all tie into one huge global monopoly.
[00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:51.671]  I want to show folks some background knowledge, and we're all humans.
[00:57:51.711 --> 00:57:53.751]  We're all people that care about freedom.
[00:57:54.151 --> 00:57:54.751]  I get upset.
[00:57:54.811 --> 00:57:55.591]  Rob gets upset.
[00:57:55.951 --> 00:57:59.412]  As we spend weeks studying this, we finally get on air, and it's just, it's so upsetting.
[00:57:59.712 --> 00:58:01.913]  We've covered 10% of what's in front of us.
[00:58:02.473 --> 00:58:04.653]  Every bit of this is just as insane or more insane.
[00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:08.674]  I haven't even gotten to the part where they admit they're doing this to kill you and save the Earth.
[00:58:08.954 --> 00:58:10.494]  I mean, they admit they're doing this.
[00:58:10.894 --> 00:58:17.636]  Klaus Schwab, all of them, but both of you, spend a few minutes just in summation of the bombshells that have been released here.
[00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:27.324]  To me, the strongest thing is the drug name's the same before a drug even exists, the virus name the same before they release it, them running the lab.
[00:58:27.384 --> 00:58:29.105]  I mean, this is smoking gun.
[00:58:29.545 --> 00:58:32.085]  One in 85 trillion quadrillion.
[00:58:32.165 --> 00:58:39.007]  I mean, this is premeditated, total proof by the drills they did, which they're using as the model for the takeover.
[00:58:39.207 --> 00:58:41.511]  I just wish there was just some court that could take this up.
[00:58:41.611 --> 00:58:47.600]  It looks like they're just admitting all these crimes and they happen exactly like they write about, word for word.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.386]  If anyone just picks this up and runs with it, I mean, this is smoking gun evidence, Alex.
[00:58:51.726 --> 00:58:53.168]  And here's why I'm so upset.
[00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:59.003]  I know a bunch of people that have gotten super sick or that have died from the vaccine.
[00:58:59.763 --> 00:59:06.847]  I know people now that are so freaked out that I warned that they're basically in catatonic shock because, hey, warn your family.
[00:59:06.907 --> 00:59:09.648]  And then people I know, their family took it and are dead.
[00:59:10.512 --> 00:59:10.592]  I'm
[00:59:28.669 --> 00:59:28.949]  Right here.
[00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:31.190]  That they say it's gonna happen!
[00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:32.270]  It's all in here.
[00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:33.571]  I mean, that's what I'm telling you.
[00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:34.131]  Go ahead.
[00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:46.135]  That's what's crazy is, the big story here isn't that they planned all this and released it and the money and the power grab and the forced inoculation and the global tracking system, but they didn't just give us sugar water, they're frickin' killed!
[00:59:46.335 --> 00:59:55.918]  They're depopulating people with horrible, degenerative diseases that'll hold them down, so now the whole family's wealth will go to take care of mom or the son or the daughter or dad.
[00:59:56.798 --> 00:59:58.902]  So it's a soft kill weapon that sucks you dry!
[00:59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.284]  And you're constantly paying them.
[01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:01.406]  It's the drugs.
[01:00:01.466 --> 01:00:02.708]  It's the oral drugs.
[01:00:02.748 --> 01:00:03.649]  It's vaccines.
[01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:06.554]  It's the new thing that Bill Gates has to release out.
[01:00:06.594 --> 01:00:11.242]  It's constant medical intervention that only they can supply these new medicines.
[01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:20.091]  Well, I tell you what, I think one thing I'd like to look at and show everybody are these tweets that they write.
[01:00:20.212 --> 01:00:26.053]  Oh my God, this is even... This is more bombshell than anything else that we've even covered, which to me is just, it's insane.
[01:00:26.974 --> 01:00:29.414]  Guys, pull up, we're going to do the CDC tweets first.
[01:00:29.774 --> 01:00:31.155]  You should have a list right there.
[01:00:31.355 --> 01:00:32.855]  I've got one, here's my copy, here we go.
[01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.756]  Yeah, so we'll do the ones with CDC first.
[01:00:34.796 --> 01:00:40.658]  So, CDC says, holiday travel plans, stop SPARS by washing your hands and avoiding public places.
[01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:41.398]  Okay.
[01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:44.902]  Then you go to the CDC actual tweet that they put out February 23rd.
[01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:46.564]  Talks about washing your hands.
[01:00:46.624 --> 01:00:47.324]  Takes several days.
[01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:49.226]  They have a picture of a person washing their hands.
[01:00:49.607 --> 01:00:50.868]  Coronavirus disease 2019.
[01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:52.750]  And they're showing it right there.
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:56.033]  And that's when they were changing it from Wuhan flu to COVID-19.
[01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.514]  They're trying to get everybody on that.
[01:00:57.574 --> 01:00:58.635]  Instead of saying coronavirus.
[01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:01.598]  Because when you look up coronavirus, you go, oh, it's a common cold.
[01:01:01.899 --> 01:01:02.700]  This isn't that bad.
[01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:04.022]  But there's one.
[01:01:04.322 --> 01:01:04.923]  The next one.
[01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.884]  If you feel ill, seek medical attention.
[01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.365]  Use the Vampire Cough.
[01:01:09.385 --> 01:01:10.826]  You know what the Vampire Cough is?
[01:01:11.466 --> 01:01:12.267]  Go to the next one, guys.
[01:01:12.427 --> 01:01:14.908]  That's when you put your, you cough into your elbow.
[01:01:15.108 --> 01:01:15.809]  Like a vampire.
[01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:17.530]  So you're coughing into your elbow.
[01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.071]  Here, the CDC puts out another tweet.
[01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:21.172]  Cover your cough.
[01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:21.812]  Wash your hands.
[01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:22.693]  Stay home when sick.
[01:01:23.253 --> 01:01:24.414]  All this is the same thing.
[01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:26.555]  So they're basically using the same language.
[01:01:27.095 --> 01:01:28.476]  It's gonna get crazy here in a second.
[01:01:28.996 --> 01:01:30.957]  Practice good hygiene during Thanksgiving travels.
[01:01:30.997 --> 01:01:32.738]  Bring home leftovers, not spars.
[01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:34.979]  Today is World Hygiene Day.
[01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:35.960]  Hygiene.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.421]  Thankful for the brave health care providers on the front line.
[01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:39.762]  Clean your hands.
[01:01:39.842 --> 01:01:40.502]  Wash your hands.
[01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.183]  Do all this stuff.
[01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:44.644]  Now, the point is, the simulation is reality.
[01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:47.206]  They're just testing it, preparing it, getting their people ready.
[01:01:47.846 --> 01:01:48.566]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:01:48.606 --> 01:01:49.787]  Be safe on Black Friday.
[01:01:49.867 --> 01:01:53.128]  Have a, you know, basically virtual Cyber Monday instead.
[01:01:53.488 --> 01:01:57.469]  And then CDC recommends virtual Thanksgiving to lessen the risk of COVID-19.
[01:01:57.709 --> 01:02:00.109]  So this was done years before it actually happens.
[01:02:00.389 --> 01:02:00.670]  It is.
[01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:02.790]  And it's just insane.
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:09.072]  I want to go to this last one here, and we could go through all these, but we're comparing a rapper, BZ, this fictional rapper.
[01:02:10.254 --> 01:02:11.914]  And I'm looking for, yeah, Jerome Adams.
[01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:16.235]  BZ puts out a tweet that says vaccines work in the year 2026.
[01:02:17.175 --> 01:02:17.836]  Vaccines work.
[01:02:17.876 --> 01:02:18.416]  Hashtag.
[01:02:18.976 --> 01:02:21.876]  Jerome Adams uses to all vaccines work advocates.
[01:02:22.537 --> 01:02:24.217]  He uses the same exact hashtag.
[01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:31.078]  So they thought of this hashtag before and they have the Closivir, which is the Remdesivir version of the drug.
[01:02:31.398 --> 01:02:33.199]  But here's the fake rapper pushing it.
[01:02:33.259 --> 01:02:37.480]  And now we have Jerome Adams, the former Surgeon General, pushing the exact same thing.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.620]  Vaccines work.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.740]  Hashtag vaccines work.
[01:02:40.031 --> 01:02:41.111]  Now here's the thing, guys.
[01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:46.453]  They consulted with Ogilvy, which is an advertising agency, for this exercise.
[01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:56.616]  It says on their website, on the centerforhealthsecurity.org, that they are working with Ogilvy's guidelines for rolling out marketing campaigns.
[01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:59.777]  So this is a huge marketing advertising campaign.
[01:02:59.797 --> 01:03:01.617]  It's just that everybody has bought into it.
[01:03:01.897 --> 01:03:02.818]  They think it's real.
[01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:03.818]  It's actually just marketing.
[01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:05.395]  It is.
[01:03:05.455 --> 01:03:06.096]  It's all marketing.
[01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:09.017]  And then it makes you sick for the rest of your life.
[01:03:09.757 --> 01:03:13.158]  And they admit that the top scientists have looked at these mRNA vaccines especially.
[01:03:13.478 --> 01:03:18.200]  They turn off your body's natural defenses, so you'll always will need something new for everything now.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.641]  You'll be like the boy in the bubble.
[01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:20.561]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:21.262]  It's pretty sick.
[01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:23.082]  Now we have BZ, this fictional rapper.
[01:03:23.122 --> 01:03:26.704]  Now we have Run DMC, who's come out with their animation to get the vaccine.
[01:03:26.724 --> 01:03:27.444]  Roll up your sleeve.
[01:03:27.484 --> 01:03:27.744]  Get it.
[01:03:28.144 --> 01:03:28.524]  There it is.
[01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:29.865]  I got the vaccine.
[01:03:29.885 --> 01:03:30.905]  You got the vaccine.
[01:03:30.965 --> 01:03:31.926]  They got the vaccine.
[01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:33.559]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:03:34.359 --> 01:03:37.860]  That was promoted, the Run DMC thing was promoted by everybody under the sun.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.441]  We have John Legend getting his vaccine.
[01:03:40.701 --> 01:03:43.661]  Walgreens taps John Legend to encourage vaccinations.
[01:03:44.122 --> 01:03:50.323]  And then here's BZ saying, look, you know, we had Tuskegee, but you know, I'm just proud of how everybody's coming together to do all this.
[01:03:50.383 --> 01:03:54.264]  So they're even working the Tuskegee angle into this because they've war-gamed
[01:03:55.089 --> 01:03:59.531]  A black celebrity, like Wendy Williams, who came out and said, I'm not getting the vaccine, I don't trust it.
[01:03:59.771 --> 01:04:02.332]  She didn't say Tuskegee, but we know that's what she's thinking.
[01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:06.934]  Because everybody else that's black that's looking at this and not doing it, they're thinking Tuskegee.
[01:04:06.974 --> 01:04:08.255]  And that's the tip of the iceberg.
[01:04:08.295 --> 01:04:15.118]  And expanding on that, you have to understand, folks, it's the same names years before of the operations.
[01:04:15.238 --> 01:04:17.079]  All right, I want to show people these documents now.
[01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:19.740]  This is from the Times of London.
[01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:22.361]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:23.401]  It's from the London Guardian.
[01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:25.302]  This is all from 12 years ago, okay?
[01:04:26.582 --> 01:04:27.422]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:04:27.722 --> 01:04:32.283]  Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[01:04:33.023 --> 01:04:33.723]  What do they say?
[01:04:34.063 --> 01:04:45.926]  Bill Gates with Ted Turner and with David Rockefeller and Oprah Winfrey and others, Warren Buffett are meeting to take over the UN to carry out Obamacare globally.
[01:04:46.066 --> 01:04:47.186]  This is when Obama was first elected.
[01:04:49.138 --> 01:04:52.721]  They called the Good Club and they want to save the world by depopulating the planet.
[01:04:52.881 --> 01:04:53.401]  Lennon Guardian.
[01:04:53.882 --> 01:04:55.323]  Obama had just been elected in 2009.
[01:04:55.363 --> 01:04:58.165]  Right there.
[01:04:58.365 --> 01:04:58.165]  2009.
[01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:01.588]  Hey, take your vaccine.
[01:05:01.668 --> 01:05:02.408]  Obama's black.
[01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:04.690]  Billionaires try to save the world.
[01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:05.751]  It's all right there.
[01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:07.853]  Global Obamacare.
[01:05:07.873 --> 01:05:09.114]  The Good Club billionaires.
[01:05:12.674 --> 01:05:15.316]  Coronavirus, UK lockdown, and it goes on.
[01:05:15.556 --> 01:05:18.537]  Oh, a big drop in air pollution, says Klaus Schwab.
[01:05:18.898 --> 01:05:20.098]  We're saving the earth.
[01:05:20.138 --> 01:05:21.659]  It was good to lock things down.
[01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.620]  We need global lockdowns.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.843]  Reducing CO2 and atmosphere would require COVID-like lockdowns for decades.
[01:05:28.963 --> 01:05:30.324]  Yeah, they want to do one every two years.
[01:05:30.364 --> 01:05:31.965]  They're like, every two years, we're going to have a lockdown.
[01:05:31.985 --> 01:05:36.427]  Coronavirus lockdown emissions dropped drastically, but it's having little impact on climate change.
[01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:38.389]  Sky News.
[01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:40.670]  So why did I just show you that?
[01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.988]  They admit this is not about saving you.
[01:05:46.048 --> 01:05:46.928]  It's about killing you.
[01:05:46.968 --> 01:05:52.553]  Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you in videos online, but he wants you to take a shot because he cares about you.
[01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:53.553]  Here's the News Wars article.
[01:05:53.814 --> 01:05:54.734]  Don't believe News Wars?
[01:05:56.616 --> 01:06:00.159]  Go right here and see the videos that we got off the UN website.
[01:06:00.219 --> 01:06:01.319]  This happened in December.
[01:06:01.339 --> 01:06:03.821]  It took us a month for listeners to point it out to us.
[01:06:03.901 --> 01:06:04.922]  We didn't know about it.
[01:06:05.523 --> 01:06:09.466]  Listeners pointed out to us about this new drill that's so key.
[01:06:10.492 --> 01:06:12.075]  Or this new drill we just discovered.
[01:06:12.396 --> 01:06:15.904]  Top UN scientist admits vaccine's killing people during vaccine safety summit.
[01:06:16.285 --> 01:06:18.008]  Go watch the video.
[01:06:18.329 --> 01:06:21.396]  I set up a whole video site to get around censorship just so you see it.
[01:06:23.308 --> 01:06:24.749]  And then it gets a lot worse.
[01:06:43.886 --> 01:06:44.366]  Smattering.
[01:06:44.386 --> 01:06:45.326]  This is just breadcrumbs.
[01:06:45.366 --> 01:06:47.507]  I'm showing you what's happening.
[01:06:47.547 --> 01:06:48.467]  I'm saying here's the U.N.
[01:06:48.507 --> 01:06:54.688]  vaccine director saying they don't work, they're killing you, and the frontline doctors think it's bad right before they launch this attack to distract everybody.
[01:06:55.108 --> 01:06:59.409]  Here's CNN saying we want you to live under tyranny, hold you hostage so you take whatever shots we want.
[01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:01.150]  I already showed you her say that.
[01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:10.372]  Nickelodeon announces Fauci COVID-19 news breaks where he brainwashes them and says demand to your parents you get these shots or you're gonna die.
[01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:11.785]  Good news.
[01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.927]  Five states who've had enough of their governor's emergency powers.
[01:07:14.967 --> 01:07:15.528]  Big article.
[01:07:15.828 --> 01:07:16.408]  Daily Wire.
[01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:20.911]  Oh, we've got now petitions that ban us off Amazon.
[01:07:21.331 --> 01:07:26.715]  Americans, vaccination cards may only be the record of your immunity, so keep them safe if you want to travel.
[01:07:28.296 --> 01:07:30.077]  COVID in the age of censorship.
[01:07:30.137 --> 01:07:39.623]  Wall Street Journal, from December of last year, admitting that it was a total takeover by big tech of even mainline scientists, mainline universities,
[01:07:40.879 --> 01:07:45.383]  Saying what they're doing is wrong with COVID-19 and the vaccine won't work because it's a common cold.
[01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:48.065]  But they man-made it, so Gates owns it.
[01:07:49.186 --> 01:07:51.547]  COVID is accelerating a global censorship crisis.
[01:07:51.608 --> 01:07:53.969]  Wired.
[01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:59.654]  Big Tech has hearings in Congress last week and they go, we're not censoring anybody.
[01:08:00.374 --> 01:08:01.896]  It's all publicly admitted right here.
[01:08:03.897 --> 01:08:07.280]  How Bill Gates premeditated COVID vaccine injury censorship.
[01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:17.227]  Before it even got bad, before they even killed us, what you were saying, Mike, he got it all set up to set up the groups that censor you and your family getting hurt.
[01:08:18.007 --> 01:08:19.028]  What a damn monster.
[01:08:19.388 --> 01:08:21.249]  It's like somebody putting a gag in your mouth before they kill you.
[01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:25.292]  The censorship of COVID-19 data around the world.
[01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:28.030]  F-E-E dot org.
[01:08:28.570 --> 01:08:29.491]  Centership kills.
[01:08:29.531 --> 01:08:31.112]  The shunning of a COVID therapeutic.
[01:08:31.352 --> 01:08:33.274]  Won't let you know about natural things that protect you.
[01:08:33.554 --> 01:08:35.836]  This is all around giant depopulation evil.
[01:08:35.876 --> 01:08:36.957]  I'm going to stop on that one second.
[01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:37.297]  Go ahead.
[01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:48.806]  These therapeutics with hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, the reason they had to fight those is because if they had an actual treatment for this disease, they couldn't have their warp speed.
[01:08:49.006 --> 01:08:51.048]  And they wouldn't have any, they had to say,
[01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:51.868]  Explain that.
[01:08:51.988 --> 01:08:55.950]  They had to say there's nothing that helps, so you get emergency authorization.
[01:08:56.150 --> 01:09:03.754]  And there's a whole bunch of stuff that helps, like an orange, or like zinc, or like vitamin D. Then they couldn't have this emergency authorization.
[01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:07.136]  So the emergency authorization is what allows them to push these vaccines down your throat.
[01:09:07.416 --> 01:09:09.217]  It's what allows them to say, oh, the FDA approved it.
[01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:11.618]  For emergency authorization, you idiot!
[01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.518]  It's not for regular use.
[01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:18.959]  And when they decide to stop that emergency authorization, you're going to see all the vaccines dry up.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.420]  Because they haven't been approved by the FDA.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.540]  Because there haven't been any studies.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.721]  That's the big thing.
[01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:25.201]  They haven't done the studies.
[01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:27.321]  They're doing them now, as they're injecting it into you.
[01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:31.782]  And remember, as this Berlin Wall of Evil descends on all of us, you are the resistance.
[01:09:31.942 --> 01:09:33.263]  Only you can get this live feed out.
[01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:34.563]  Only you can share the video.
[01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.503]  I don't know how long we'll be on air, folks.
[01:09:36.523 --> 01:09:37.884]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:09:37.904 --> 01:09:38.944]  That's why I'm here seven days a week.
[01:09:39.324 --> 01:09:42.066]  Now, let's look at these documents and we're going to close this out, folks.
[01:09:42.086 --> 01:09:44.368]  We'll cover it more on the Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:46.991]  No vaccine, no service.
[01:09:47.031 --> 01:09:49.413]  How vaccinations may affect travel plans of the future.
[01:09:49.813 --> 01:09:50.914]  CNBC.
[01:09:51.575 --> 01:09:55.098]  Second-generation COVID vaccines are coming because they're saying the first ones don't work.
[01:09:55.238 --> 01:09:55.638]  Oh, really?
[01:09:55.918 --> 01:09:57.840]  And the second and the third won't work until you wake up.
[01:09:58.501 --> 01:09:59.321]  They'll work to kill you.
[01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:03.465]  Plan now to speed vaccine supply to future pandemics.
[01:10:03.865 --> 01:10:04.586]  Yes, nature.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.101]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:07.662]  And here it is.
[01:10:07.702 --> 01:10:12.947]  Bill Gates admits that as many as 700,000 people will get sick or die from the vaccine.
[01:10:13.027 --> 01:10:15.749]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:10:15.889 --> 01:10:19.532]  And China is in charge of the tracking and the control.
[01:10:20.093 --> 01:10:21.154]  So, Mike Halpern.
[01:10:23.214 --> 01:10:25.595]  In closing here, we're going to spend a few minutes here and finish up.
[01:10:26.076 --> 01:10:26.696]  Take your time.
[01:10:26.796 --> 01:10:27.957]  Other data points you want to hit.
[01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:29.378]  Other areas you want to hit.
[01:10:29.418 --> 01:10:30.959]  You've done a great job briefing me on this.
[01:10:31.319 --> 01:10:32.640]  Rob Dues did a splendid job as well.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.060]  The crews.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:34.020]  And I mean it.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.301]  They're up here working seven days a week.
[01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:37.022]  I want to give a hand out to the crews.
[01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:38.303]  It's very stressful, folks.
[01:10:38.803 --> 01:10:44.026]  Knowing this is happening, admitting it's happening, not being under Stockholm Syndrome, deciding to fight back.
[01:10:44.326 --> 01:10:49.790]  Instead of being victims, we're all supercharged, ready to tear each other's heads off like psychotic gorillas.
[01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.131]  Because this is the animating contents of Liberty.
[01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:54.873]  We're not going to sit here and go die in some ditch.
[01:10:55.113 --> 01:10:56.214]  We know we're being killed.
[01:10:56.434 --> 01:10:57.474]  We know we're under attack.
[01:10:57.695 --> 01:11:05.779]  And we're going to expose and laze the individuals that are doing this to us so that in the future, people know who's going to stand trial at Nuremberg 2.0.
[01:11:07.711 --> 01:11:11.095]  Yeah, Alex, I mean, the main thing that they're trying to do is separate us from other people.
[01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:17.242]  A lot of the targeting that they're talking about in the exercise is get blacks separated from the anti-vaxxers.
[01:11:17.623 --> 01:11:19.225]  Separate the Muslims from the Jews.
[01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:21.307]  They don't want groups of people... Isolate us!
[01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:23.810]  Make us... It's in all the Facebook documents, they admit.
[01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.691]  Make us depressed.
[01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:25.312]  Make us alone.
[01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:30.573]  Right, and when you're alone, you're on your phone, you're looking at the Facebook, and you're isolated.
[01:11:30.693 --> 01:11:33.415]  When you start talking to people, then the word gets out.
[01:11:33.435 --> 01:11:36.216]  And that's what we're really trying to achieve here at InfoWars, is just to get the word out.
[01:11:36.236 --> 01:11:37.556]  I agree, and I'm interrupting you pulling up.
[01:11:37.576 --> 01:11:38.977]  Guys, pull up the Jungle Book car.
[01:11:39.037 --> 01:11:40.518]  It's the snake wants to hypnotize you.
[01:11:40.638 --> 01:11:41.838]  That's right, and that's what this is all about.
[01:11:41.858 --> 01:11:44.380]  The answer, go have a walk, go hug somebody, who cares?
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.020]  Yeah, it does.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:45.640]  Explain it to people.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:46.621]  In the Bible.
[01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:47.301]  Start over, start over.
[01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:55.144]  Yeah, I mean, basically what they're trying to do is just isolate us, keep you on your app, keep you on your phone, and you're not talking to other people.
[01:11:55.184 --> 01:11:56.004]  You're not going out.
[01:11:56.065 --> 01:11:57.585]  You're not taking a walk with somebody.
[01:11:57.885 --> 01:11:58.906]  You're not going out for lunch.
[01:11:59.426 --> 01:12:05.828]  And that's what they really are afraid of, because when you're isolated, you're going to go and be hypnotized by their marketing campaigns.
[01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:08.970]  One of the big parts we didn't touch on, I just want to touch briefly on.
[01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.510]  No, take your time.
[01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:25.177]  Is that they have a big problem and they have a problem with demand and they have to balance supply with demand so the whole exercise even with Crimson Contagion, Event 201 and Spars is that they need to create the problem everyone freaks out
[01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.578]  And they all demand a vaccine.
[01:12:27.858 --> 01:12:29.559]  They can't just roll out a vaccine.
[01:12:29.599 --> 01:12:43.566]  So these timelines that Rob was talking about, they're on purpose in the exercise and in real life because when you're thinking about the vaccine all day with this marketing campaigns, eventually you really are ready to take this vaccine when it's available.
[01:12:43.866 --> 01:12:46.147]  And they start off with certain groups in the exercise.
[01:12:46.187 --> 01:12:48.729]  Hopefully the readers and viewers will actually read this.
[01:12:49.429 --> 01:12:54.370]  And when only some people can get the vaccine, other people want it.
[01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:56.111]  It's like scarcity, artificial scarcity.
[01:12:56.131 --> 01:12:58.332]  It's like the nightclub where only some people can get in.
[01:12:58.372 --> 01:12:59.812]  That South Park episode was about that.
[01:12:59.852 --> 01:13:00.212]  And I agree.
[01:13:00.232 --> 01:13:01.212]  Let's finish up with Cobb.
[01:13:01.272 --> 01:13:01.813]  Keep talking.
[01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:06.434]  I want to show like, like, you know, like the Good Panther, Bagheera's asleep.
[01:13:07.523 --> 01:13:10.544]  Tries to kill Mowgli, saves him, but then the snake tries to hypnotize him as well.
[01:13:11.024 --> 01:13:14.745]  We have to get used to the fact they are literally trying to medically hypnotize us.
[01:13:15.065 --> 01:13:16.446]  We have to become conscious of this.
[01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:23.848]  And a few of the articles that we've talked about the last few weeks are about them being able to get children to take the vaccine without parents' consent.
[01:13:24.168 --> 01:13:25.629]  They're going after your children, folks.
[01:13:26.829 --> 01:13:30.210]  California passed a law that 12 year olds can have a shot without parents' consent.
[01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:31.911]  They're going right in for your kids.
[01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:34.593]  This is a really evil force that's behind all this.
[01:13:34.653 --> 01:13:36.174]  It's not Fauci on TV.
[01:13:36.575 --> 01:13:38.416]  It's not these health officials down the street.
[01:13:38.676 --> 01:13:42.299]  It's really sinister people that run this whole cabal.
[01:13:42.359 --> 01:13:45.161]  It's so insane to even think about, but that's what's really going on here.
[01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:51.765]  Just to give everyone a heads up, in the next few months, hey, if you want to predict the future, it says it right in the documents.
[01:13:51.806 --> 01:13:55.048]  It says, potentially, you're going to get pneumonia.
[01:13:55.068 --> 01:13:56.429]  It says it in the next few months.
[01:13:57.009 --> 01:13:59.091]  Oh, this is the most important part of everything.
[01:13:59.611 --> 01:14:14.618]  Read to them, start over, about how, okay, there's going to be brain damage, we've got to pay them out, we've got to let them know, don't go to lawyers, there's a federal fund, we'll get you money, and that there's going to be pneumonia too, which we know the mask causes, the chemicals they put in the mask.
[01:14:14.638 --> 01:14:14.978]  That's right.
[01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:15.599]  Explain this.
[01:14:15.679 --> 01:14:16.379]  Take time on this.
[01:14:16.459 --> 01:14:22.862]  Okay, so the timeline, please, if you're listening, if you're watching, just read this document and take your own opinion for it.
[01:14:23.202 --> 01:14:26.864]  But after they release SPARS, nine months later they have a vaccine.
[01:14:26.924 --> 01:14:27.745]  Rob talked about that.
[01:14:28.085 --> 01:14:33.808]  Then five months later, which is identical to what we're living right now, everyone else has access to it.
[01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:35.489]  So we got that vaccine in December.
[01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:37.070]  And right now it's April.
[01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:38.311]  That's five months.
[01:14:38.431 --> 01:14:40.352]  Now everyone on TV is getting the vaccine.
[01:14:40.372 --> 01:14:41.593]  They're opening up to more groups.
[01:14:42.194 --> 01:14:46.817]  So it really, they said three years, really nine months they make it, then five months everybody gets it.
[01:14:46.837 --> 01:14:47.598]  It's all exact.
[01:14:47.758 --> 01:14:47.938]  Right.
[01:14:48.018 --> 01:14:53.703]  And then so two months later, February of 2027, in the exercise it talks about
[01:14:54.423 --> 01:15:02.508]  You know what that is though?
[01:15:02.609 --> 01:15:06.731]  Once you have this, the scientists said it'll cause an autoimmune response to regular cold viruses.
[01:15:06.991 --> 01:15:12.295]  And so now, like the Spanish flu, your lungs will fill up with fluid and an autoimmune response and they're going to call it pneumonia!
[01:15:12.315 --> 01:15:13.316]  God, they're geniuses!
[01:15:24.383 --> 01:15:26.024]  The mask causing bacterial pneumonia.
[01:15:26.044 --> 01:15:27.785]  Man, these are some diabolical bastards.
[01:15:27.865 --> 01:15:29.867]  Now, they don't talk about the mask inside the exercise.
[01:15:30.007 --> 01:15:31.828]  They do talk about post-sparse pneumonia.
[01:15:31.848 --> 01:15:32.729]  I think they're talking about the mask.
[01:15:32.749 --> 01:15:36.371]  Yeah, they're talking about mask in a lockstep event 201.
[01:15:36.972 --> 01:15:38.433]  And crimson contagion is the mask.
[01:15:38.473 --> 01:15:39.434]  But in this one, they don't.
[01:15:39.934 --> 01:15:42.175]  It's just up to the viewer to put two and two together.
[01:15:42.215 --> 01:15:52.322]  Then five months later, that initial priority high-risk population, which is people with pre-existing conditions and health workers that were given the vaccine first a couple months ago,
[01:15:53.143 --> 01:15:57.266]  They begin to get sick with little available data and numerous pre-existing conditions.
[01:15:57.446 --> 01:15:57.826]  Numerous.
[01:15:57.846 --> 01:15:59.147]  The quote there is numerous.
[01:15:59.468 --> 01:16:01.929]  They're getting people with like cancer and heart disease.
[01:16:02.269 --> 01:16:07.753]  Then you go in to get your shot and then later you get sick with little available data and numerous pre-existing conditions.
[01:16:07.873 --> 01:16:12.877]  Initial studies were unable to identify a statistically significant association.
[01:16:13.017 --> 01:16:15.319]  Because it's binary or it's even three weapons.
[01:16:15.959 --> 01:16:16.340]  Or four.
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.200]  I mean, people don't know this.
[01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:24.508]  At UT right now, they're already releasing a fly that lays a thing on the back of the head of a fire ant that eats its brain like the movie Alien.
[01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:28.992]  We've got carp in a little lake we have that have been sterilized with one chemical.
[01:16:29.032 --> 01:16:32.255]  They just put a few drops in when they're baby fish and it sterilizes them.
[01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:33.897]  The globalists are doing this to us.
[01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:34.838]  That's what all this is.
[01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:35.279]  That's right.
[01:16:35.993 --> 01:16:54.399]  And so even nine months after that, it says, if you want to predict the future and let all your family and friends know, it says in nine months after that, they're going to say that sparse or in this case, COVID-19 pandemic is over, but experts remain concerned about domestic animal reservoirs and the potential for future outbreaks.
[01:16:54.419 --> 01:16:58.100]  We see that on the news every day, new variants for new vaccines.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.701]  And now we're in a new world.
[01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:00.861]  We're post COVID.
[01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.982]  It's post-COVID, but you still need to take your shot.
[01:17:03.162 --> 01:17:07.123]  It never ends, but they may even come out and say COVID-19 has ended, but you still have to take your shot.
[01:17:07.503 --> 01:17:08.824]  Well, absolutely incredible.
[01:17:08.864 --> 01:17:13.745]  And that's why we're spending hours here getting this out, and we've only scratched the surface.
[01:17:13.865 --> 01:17:14.446]  We really have.
[01:17:14.786 --> 01:17:15.606]  But look at the lockdown.
[01:17:15.646 --> 01:17:16.646]  What happened with the lockdown?
[01:17:16.706 --> 01:17:18.127]  They closed bars and restaurants.
[01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.227]  That was the big thing they closed.
[01:17:19.307 --> 01:17:20.828]  That's where people gather and talk.
[01:17:21.328 --> 01:17:23.331]  Without the phone giving you the messages.
[01:17:23.651 --> 01:17:24.792]  So you get those messages from the phone.
[01:17:24.832 --> 01:17:26.114]  It was forcing you into it.
[01:17:26.535 --> 01:17:27.015]  Exactly.
[01:17:27.336 --> 01:17:31.681]  Medical studies show about half the public is in a near medical trance, a daydream.
[01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:36.387]  They wanted to induce others into it because it's not working and get more control, more depression.
[01:17:36.627 --> 01:17:37.767]  And so they lock everybody up.
[01:17:37.807 --> 01:17:38.767]  You're getting the messages.
[01:17:38.827 --> 01:17:41.048]  Now you want the vaccine so you can get unlocked up.
[01:17:41.668 --> 01:17:43.929]  And so that gets everybody pushing to the vaccine.
[01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:45.169]  That's where the revolution started.
[01:17:45.289 --> 01:17:46.789]  It started in bars in Boston.
[01:17:47.169 --> 01:17:47.849]  That's where it started.
[01:17:47.889 --> 01:17:50.330]  That's where people got together and said, we're sick of this crap.
[01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:52.630]  We're going to start speaking out against it.
[01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:55.911]  We're going to start putting pamphlets out, which is what we're doing today.
[01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:57.031]  We're literally in a bar.
[01:17:57.051 --> 01:18:02.432]  Which again, when we sneeze on each other and shake hands, we're just like cells giving each other data to beat microbes.
[01:18:02.472 --> 01:18:02.973]  We're humans.
[01:18:03.073 --> 01:18:03.273]  Right.
[01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:05.113]  We're supposed to share all that stuff.
[01:18:05.273 --> 01:18:05.793]  Oh yeah, totally.
[01:18:05.833 --> 01:18:07.454]  And all the studies show it makes us stronger.
[01:18:07.494 --> 01:18:08.475]  Instead, we're not sharing it.
[01:18:08.815 --> 01:18:09.675]  We're not sharing it anymore.
[01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:11.276]  Our immune systems are getting weaker.
[01:18:11.576 --> 01:18:13.197]  And then, oh, you're going to take this vaccine?
[01:18:13.277 --> 01:18:15.298]  Yeah, it's a binary weapon, six months down the road.
[01:18:15.318 --> 01:18:20.581]  But if you really want to look at stuff, go back to last year, February of this time, when you had Dr. Francis Boyle on.
[01:18:20.881 --> 01:18:24.924]  He was telling you what was in the disease and where it came from, all the way back to North Carolina.
[01:18:24.964 --> 01:18:26.645]  And now the U.N.
[01:18:26.685 --> 01:18:27.745]  and China lied.
[01:18:27.765 --> 01:18:28.125]  Why would they?
[01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:29.066]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:29.346 --> 01:18:31.207]  I mean, we were saying it came from the lab.
[01:18:31.267 --> 01:18:32.127]  It didn't come from a bat.
[01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:32.727]  There's no way.
[01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:35.348]  And there's still even, now you can kind of feel that.
[01:18:35.408 --> 01:18:41.171]  The CDC director, the former CDC director finally came and said, well, I don't think it came and I'm allowed to have my opinion.
[01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:44.752]  That's the former CDC director who was basically Fauci's little weenie.
[01:18:44.772 --> 01:18:50.434]  But listen, we have the Indian and Australian scientists and the discoverer of HIV scanned it with electron microscopes.
[01:18:50.454 --> 01:18:52.355]  It's frickin' Frankenstein, dude.
[01:18:52.435 --> 01:18:54.096]  It's got five viruses together.
[01:18:54.656 --> 01:18:54.896]  It is.
[01:18:55.156 --> 01:18:56.657]  We're right again, but folks, here's the deal.
[01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:00.864]  So far, this is a three-year drill.
[01:19:01.024 --> 01:19:04.766]  We're a little more than a year into the drill, and it's happening exactly as the drill says.
[01:19:05.126 --> 01:19:09.409]  Now within six months or less, massive brain damage, massive death.
[01:19:09.449 --> 01:19:10.329]  You already see it happening.
[01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:12.191]  That's just because it's so strong.
[01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:14.212]  It's not supposed to kill you right away, but it's so strong.
[01:19:14.592 --> 01:19:16.053]  Like Gates said, well, it's got to be really strong.
[01:19:16.473 --> 01:19:17.594]  It's supposed to hit you a year later.
[01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:19.695]  We're about to see all hell break loose.
[01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:20.376]  I just got chills.
[01:19:21.295 --> 01:19:22.576]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:19:22.736 --> 01:19:24.858]  It's a timeline that they're following.
[01:19:25.298 --> 01:19:28.580]  They're minions like Saki on TV or the pastor.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.523]  We have articles about them hiring pastors to deliver to the black.
[01:19:34.064 --> 01:19:38.367]  They've all got the Spars report and it's a script.
[01:19:38.427 --> 01:19:41.909]  They're like people in a college acting club.
[01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:43.330]  They're just following the freaking script.
[01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:47.455]  Well, those little pages there are little exercises for you to think about, for you and your minions to talk about.
[01:19:47.495 --> 01:19:48.275]  How are we going to wargame?
[01:19:48.295 --> 01:19:48.856]  Here's your script.
[01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:49.997]  OK, we're glad you're in the play.
[01:19:51.159 --> 01:19:51.839]  Memorize your lines.
[01:19:51.859 --> 01:19:52.180]  Here it is.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:58.607]  And that's what this actually says it on the website, healthsecurity.org, that this whole thing is to train.
[01:19:58.707 --> 01:19:59.828]  It's not for us to be viewing.
[01:19:59.848 --> 01:20:01.410]  We're just taking the time to view it.
[01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:09.614]  It's for their people in different areas to get familiar with this terminology so that when it actually rolls out, they know the correct response to.
[01:20:09.954 --> 01:20:20.880]  Conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media suggesting that the virus had purposefully been created and introduced to the population by drug companies or that it had escaped from a government lab secretly testing bioweapons.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.560]  Which is now admitted.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:25.162]  So when we come out and say that or someone says that, they already have a line for it.
[01:20:25.182 --> 01:20:26.903]  They've already thought about it and they have the correct response.
[01:20:26.983 --> 01:20:27.203]  I agree.
[01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:28.304]  Let me show them this stack of documents.
[01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.204]  It says it on the front.
[01:20:29.264 --> 01:20:30.605]  If you guys go show the front cover.
[01:20:30.705 --> 01:20:32.245]  Public Health Risk Communicators.
[01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:33.166]  That's who this is for.
[01:20:33.266 --> 01:20:35.307]  Public Health Risk Communicators.
[01:20:35.347 --> 01:20:36.667]  Public Health Risk Communicators.
[01:20:36.727 --> 01:20:37.908]  That is who it's for.
[01:20:38.388 --> 01:20:43.831]  That is to train those people on how to talk to people about this and how to push out the next version of it.
[01:20:44.951 --> 01:20:46.192]  This is an absolute takeover.
[01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:46.852]  And here's the good news.
[01:20:46.892 --> 01:20:47.912]  We have the enemy's blueprint.
[01:20:48.733 --> 01:20:48.913]  Yeah.
[01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.254]  These little bastards think we're too dumb to read this.
[01:20:51.434 --> 01:20:54.675]  They think we're supposed to be at home watching football right now or whatever the hell's on.
[01:20:54.936 --> 01:20:55.276]  Guess what?
[01:20:55.316 --> 01:20:55.636]  I'm not.
[01:20:57.285 --> 01:21:00.586]  My wife, my children are at home, and I'm here protecting them as a man, and we're going to fight you.
[01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.506]  We're going to expose you.
[01:21:02.046 --> 01:21:02.386]  Look at this.
[01:21:02.406 --> 01:21:16.690]  This is Lockstep, which is admitting the global government takeover, Rockefeller Foundation, 2010 mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, forced masks, tighter top-down government control, and more authoritarian leadership with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.
[01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:17.811]  The new dark ages.
[01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:19.011]  Can you zoom in on that, guys?
[01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:21.951]  That's exactly what's happening now.
[01:21:21.971 --> 01:21:23.032]  This is 2010, folks.
[01:21:23.452 --> 01:21:25.814]  And it's every damn bit of it.
[01:21:26.194 --> 01:21:27.495]  It comes out of China.
[01:21:27.895 --> 01:21:28.996]  It's the model of the world.
[01:21:29.016 --> 01:21:30.057]  They lock everything down.
[01:21:30.097 --> 01:21:30.958]  We never come out of it.
[01:21:31.218 --> 01:21:38.123]  You know, Alex, there's been prominent people who saw your video of you talking about this back in 2010 and were like, how did you know?
[01:21:38.563 --> 01:21:39.804]  You're just reading the plan.
[01:21:40.324 --> 01:21:41.425]  You just read it on the air.
[01:21:41.445 --> 01:21:41.865]  That's all you did.
[01:21:41.885 --> 01:21:43.867]  Well, you had lunch with me with the former head of two U.S.
[01:21:43.927 --> 01:21:44.747]  intelligence agencies.
[01:21:44.767 --> 01:21:46.448]  They were like, we saw that video.
[01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:48.991]  You saw that I was showing a document.
[01:21:49.151 --> 01:21:50.513]  Well, there's a lot of documents.
[01:21:50.814 --> 01:21:52.936]  There's not a lot of Rockefeller's documents.
[01:21:53.277 --> 01:21:56.661]  These people run the damn... The Rockefellers created the UN.
[01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.784]  The Rockefellers created Bill Gates.
[01:21:58.804 --> 01:21:59.685]  They created Hitler.
[01:21:59.946 --> 01:22:02.489]  They put Lenin in frickin' power, dude.
[01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:03.570]  They run the show.
[01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:06.274]  And the guy, Rick Bright, you talked about earlier, Alex.
[01:22:06.654 --> 01:22:08.777]  He was running Crimson Contagion Exercise.
[01:22:08.797 --> 01:22:13.142]  He's now running the Rockefeller Center for Health, that article that you had earlier.
[01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:17.567]  But instead, the cute thing was controlling bad opposition to lead our movement.
[01:22:17.588 --> 01:22:19.209]  But if the cute thing would have just said,
[01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:21.570]  Here's the name of the document.
[01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:22.671]  You're not supposed to see it.
[01:22:23.151 --> 01:22:23.671]  SPARS 2025.
[01:22:23.891 --> 01:22:25.311]  Oh, yeah.
[01:22:25.672 --> 01:22:28.252]  Everyone would have run out, but see, it never used that esoteric power.
[01:22:28.572 --> 01:22:33.194]  I'm just up here with documents and proof and meeting with the intelligence chiefs and all everything.
[01:22:33.434 --> 01:22:34.474]  It's like, yeah, whatever.
[01:22:34.494 --> 01:22:36.375]  Yeah, it's Alex Jones.
[01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:36.855]  You know, it's like...
[01:22:37.415 --> 01:22:38.936]  I mean, it's all right here, folks.
[01:22:38.956 --> 01:22:40.718]  We're not giving it to you esoteric.
[01:22:40.918 --> 01:22:41.899]  We're naming names.
[01:22:42.139 --> 01:22:43.160]  We're telling you who they are.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.862]  We're risking our lives together because this is so real.
[01:22:45.902 --> 01:22:47.484]  And we're not asking you to trust the plan.
[01:22:47.644 --> 01:22:49.786]  We're actually asking you to read the plan.
[01:22:50.046 --> 01:22:51.047]  Just read the plan.
[01:22:51.307 --> 01:22:52.368]  You'll see it for yourself.
[01:22:52.808 --> 01:22:54.970]  As you read this, you're like, oh, this is happening right now.
[01:22:55.211 --> 01:22:55.911]  This happened last week.
[01:22:55.951 --> 01:22:58.493]  I mean, that's what that's what we've been looking at this for a while.
[01:22:58.533 --> 01:22:59.875]  It's like, oh, this will happen next week.
[01:22:59.915 --> 01:23:00.555]  It happens next week.
[01:23:00.615 --> 01:23:00.815]  Yeah.
[01:23:01.156 --> 01:23:02.437]  I mean, it's all here.
[01:23:02.757 --> 01:23:05.619]  And you can read it and you can write down on your calendar when these things are going to happen.
[01:23:05.679 --> 01:23:09.842]  It'll be within two weeks, probably of it of it happening in here and happening in real life.
[01:23:10.182 --> 01:23:11.082]  That's how crazy it is.
[01:23:11.543 --> 01:23:13.804]  And it's sick what these people are doing to us.
[01:23:13.844 --> 01:23:19.748]  And it's a member whenever people in Canada got the documents almost like eight, nine months ago, like, and they'll be locked down three at this date.
[01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:20.649]  And it happened.
[01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:22.230]  Yeah, because it was a real document.
[01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:23.992]  Cruz is like, is this a real document?
[01:23:24.012 --> 01:23:26.797]  I said, that's a Canadian government document, of course it's real.
[01:23:27.118 --> 01:23:32.707]  I said, search the terms and we searched it and there it was in hundreds of other documents from the UN.
[01:23:34.372 --> 01:23:35.253]  Of course it was real!
[01:23:35.453 --> 01:23:36.194]  These people!
[01:23:36.814 --> 01:23:38.275]  The UN's the top of that pyramid.
[01:23:39.016 --> 01:23:41.838]  Sending out information to all these other countries that want to work with it.
[01:23:42.278 --> 01:23:44.100]  I would just glance briefly over this book.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.461]  It's published by Chelsea Clinton.
[01:23:45.481 --> 01:23:47.823]  It's like global health, something like that.
[01:23:48.363 --> 01:23:55.568]  I barely even read it, but they're admitting that their world government, their world domination is through health.
[01:23:55.748 --> 01:23:57.189]  So we're just basically looking at their plans.
[01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:00.392]  This is the core of their operation, of their attack.
[01:24:00.852 --> 01:24:03.114]  And the contact tracer, she talks about that?
[01:24:03.314 --> 01:24:04.134]  Yeah, she talks about it.
[01:24:04.174 --> 01:24:06.315]  And let me show people this, since you mentioned it.
[01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:14.098]  Part of Crimson Contagion, Event 201, and all this that they launched during the attack, is ending the cycle of crisis and complacency in the U.S.
[01:24:14.118 --> 01:24:15.318]  global health security.
[01:24:15.338 --> 01:24:24.001]  It's a consortium of these groups meeting, and they say right in here, oh, we're going to get a lot of people sick when they take the vaccines.
[01:24:24.021 --> 01:24:25.622]  It's going to turn off their immune systems.
[01:24:25.922 --> 01:24:29.623]  They're going to get sick from microbes and all this, but we'll just have to cover it up.
[01:24:31.993 --> 01:24:33.494]  Look at all this right here.
[01:24:34.574 --> 01:24:35.614]  And it's the word you used.
[01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:36.694]  I just looked up this.
[01:24:36.774 --> 01:24:38.635]  The definition of medicalization.
[01:24:38.675 --> 01:24:39.855]  That's what we're going under right now.
[01:24:39.895 --> 01:24:41.355]  We're going under medicalization.
[01:24:41.656 --> 01:24:43.236]  And you talked about that eight days ago.
[01:24:43.556 --> 01:24:48.537]  You know, if you just look at, we're just looking at this information and showing people what's going to happen and then it comes true.
[01:24:48.577 --> 01:24:49.578]  And that's the crazy part.
[01:24:49.778 --> 01:24:50.998]  We've been talking about this for years.
[01:24:51.078 --> 01:24:52.758]  The brain eating vaccines, everything.
[01:24:52.778 --> 01:24:54.119]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:24:54.139 --> 01:24:55.479]  Talk about a binary weapon.
[01:24:55.859 --> 01:24:58.880]  You can give someone a poison and then you have the antidote.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.881]  They don't know what the antidote is.
[01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:02.802]  So, okay, I gave you a poison, you're dead in 20 days.
[01:25:03.242 --> 01:25:04.483]  Won't start killing you for about 10.
[01:25:04.823 --> 01:25:06.484]  Go kill this person, I'll give you the antidote.
[01:25:06.504 --> 01:25:08.666]  The Japanese would do that to some of their killers.
[01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:09.987]  And I mean, that's all this is.
[01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:12.288]  They're just making us sick so they own us and control us.
[01:25:12.428 --> 01:25:13.909]  And we're already getting used to this.
[01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:15.730]  Okay, a bunch of people are dying, old people.
[01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:17.691]  Oh, Hank Aaron took it on TV, he's dead now.
[01:25:17.771 --> 01:25:19.432]  Marvelous Marvin Hagler, he's dead now.
[01:25:19.452 --> 01:25:20.133]  They're just getting us ready.
[01:25:20.435 --> 01:25:21.535]  It says it right here, guys.
[01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:29.719]  It says the group debated whether it was appropriate for the president to acknowledge the sacrifice that vaccine recipients had made on behalf of their communities.
[01:25:29.899 --> 01:25:32.720]  Or to console them in their grief over that sacrifice.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.483]  They're just rolling this whole out and they're going to have a mental health, behavioral health... I just heard a record skip.
[01:25:38.523 --> 01:25:38.963]  Start over.
[01:25:39.023 --> 01:25:39.443]  Explain.
[01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:40.624]  That's in the document.
[01:25:41.385 --> 01:25:44.527]  That people are going to get hurt by this will make them heroes that they got hurt.
[01:25:44.847 --> 01:25:47.468]  Oh, don't criticize how the kids sterilized from chemicals in the water.
[01:25:47.728 --> 01:25:53.471]  Don't criticize how your wife has breast cancer from the Atrazine and the bisphenol A. No, no, no.
[01:25:53.511 --> 01:25:55.712]  Don't criticize those that got really sick with the vaccine.
[01:25:55.992 --> 01:25:56.853]  They're heroes.
[01:25:57.373 --> 01:26:10.036]  The group debated whether it was appropriate for the President to acknowledge the sacrifice that vaccine recipients had made on behalf of their communities, or to console them in their grief over that sacrifice.
[01:26:10.256 --> 01:26:19.257]  So the end of the exercise is about how do we handle people's children dying, their grandma just died, or she has encephalitis or neurological symptoms.
[01:26:19.617 --> 01:26:22.518]  They're saying they're going to send mental health, behavioral health people
[01:26:23.038 --> 01:26:29.002]  To either come to your house or on TV, or the President's even going to come out and say, thank you so much for your sacrifice, for participating in our exercise.
[01:26:29.042 --> 01:26:29.483]  Exactly.
[01:26:29.503 --> 01:26:32.545]  They're not going to deny that the vaccines hurt people now, like Bill Gates said.
[01:26:33.165 --> 01:26:35.527]  They're just going to say you're a hero, but you've got to take it.
[01:26:35.707 --> 01:26:36.868]  It's the greater good defense.
[01:26:36.888 --> 01:26:37.949]  This is for the greater good.
[01:26:38.549 --> 01:26:39.390]  So you had to do this.
[01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:41.712]  And if you didn't do this, everybody would be dead.
[01:26:41.732 --> 01:26:43.593]  And next is throw your daughter into a volcano.
[01:26:43.893 --> 01:26:44.113]  Sure.
[01:26:44.253 --> 01:26:46.595]  I mean, it's literally just Aztec stuff.
[01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:47.416]  For the greater good.
[01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:50.018]  Or chop off her boobs.
[01:26:51.318 --> 01:26:52.019]  That'll be the next thing.
[01:26:53.206 --> 01:26:53.687]  Make her boy.
[01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.972]  Man, I tell ya.
[01:26:56.072 --> 01:26:57.054]  Guys, great job.
[01:26:57.134 --> 01:26:58.877]  Crew, great job putting all this together.
[01:27:00.009 --> 01:27:06.553]  We're going to take this, and it probably won't air until 5 or 6 tonight, because the crew's got to go fix some of the things, add a few documents, get it ready.
[01:27:06.573 --> 01:27:08.715]  We're going to stream it and post it to Bandoff Video.
[01:27:09.635 --> 01:27:17.861]  I don't even know, what headline, Mike, Rob, John over there, the crew in there, what headline would we give this?
[01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:21.784]  I mean, how do you come up with a headline that's evil enough to get people to wake up?
[01:27:21.964 --> 01:27:22.964]  Because it's so evil, it's like...
[01:27:25.154 --> 01:27:26.195]  I mean, the name of the event?
[01:27:26.535 --> 01:27:27.695]  What do you say about this?
[01:27:28.556 --> 01:27:34.158]  Documents discovered showing pandemic planned takeover?
[01:27:34.178 --> 01:27:42.862]  I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't, or, or John Hopkins War Games preparing public for mass vaccine damage.
[01:27:42.882 --> 01:27:44.043]  I mean, what do you say to this?
[01:27:44.063 --> 01:27:45.123]  Is SPARS 2025 to 2028 the future or is it now?
[01:27:45.143 --> 01:27:45.784]  I think it's now.
[01:27:51.274 --> 01:27:55.195]  John Hopkins' document details plan to use vaccines to collapse society.
[01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:57.296]  Rob?
[01:27:57.316 --> 01:28:01.217]  Our total takeover of society, either one, which is basically the collapse of society.
[01:28:02.178 --> 01:28:03.638]  Well, they want a post-industrial world.
[01:28:03.798 --> 01:28:03.978]  Yeah.
[01:28:04.518 --> 01:28:05.419]  They want one that doesn't work.
[01:28:05.559 --> 01:28:07.800]  I mean, and notice it's America mainly taking this.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.121]  I mean, this is America being injected by the U.N., the Chi-Coms to die.
[01:28:11.841 --> 01:28:14.222]  And they've already got people at the border ready to come in.
[01:28:14.662 --> 01:28:16.142]  And they're going to keep bringing those guys.
[01:28:16.162 --> 01:28:17.023]  That's just going to get worse.
[01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:20.964]  That's the freaky part about this document is it's all American names for everything.
[01:28:21.084 --> 01:28:22.184]  It's not Brazilian names.
[01:28:22.224 --> 01:28:23.505]  It's not a World Health.
[01:28:23.545 --> 01:28:24.945]  This is the United States of America.
[01:28:24.965 --> 01:28:27.246]  They're talking about the Presidents on here.
[01:28:27.266 --> 01:28:28.027]  We didn't get into that.
[01:28:28.587 --> 01:28:31.788]  It talks about those two Democratic Presidents and one steps down.
[01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:37.630]  It's America that's globalist captured directing the destruction of the West for the Chycomps.
[01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:37.930]  100% Alex.
[01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.911]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:40.351]  I don't know what to call this.
[01:28:40.411 --> 01:28:41.712]  I don't know what to say about this.
[01:28:42.252 --> 01:28:44.613]  But again, we're following exactly what it says.
[01:28:45.473 --> 01:28:46.334]  It's in real time.
[01:28:46.374 --> 01:28:47.736]  Just move the years back three years.
[01:28:48.276 --> 01:28:50.258]  And next, it's just going to accelerate.
[01:28:50.298 --> 01:28:51.299]  And you're going to see it all happen.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.341]  You're already seeing the death.
[01:28:52.801 --> 01:28:53.882]  You're already seeing the convulsions.
[01:28:53.902 --> 01:28:54.903]  You're already seeing the rashes.
[01:28:54.923 --> 01:28:57.646]  You're already seeing the brain fog.
[01:28:57.847 --> 01:28:59.228]  You're seeing the studies admitting it.
[01:29:00.069 --> 01:29:01.711]  And we'll just be heroes.
[01:29:01.751 --> 01:29:03.913]  The news will say, well, everybody's dying.
[01:29:04.013 --> 01:29:05.295]  Oh, it's a new COVID doing it.
[01:29:05.964 --> 01:29:12.250]  Well, maybe Gates does have a point in eliminating some of these people, but we are human beings and it's not enough to just read these documents.
[01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:13.371]  You have to share them.
[01:29:13.391 --> 01:29:14.772]  You have to get this information out.
[01:29:14.832 --> 01:29:15.573]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:29:15.753 --> 01:29:16.894]  Okay, you want to kill old people.
[01:29:16.954 --> 01:29:19.316]  That's bad enough because once you do that, who's next?
[01:29:19.676 --> 01:29:20.477]  It's a slippery slope.
[01:29:21.278 --> 01:29:23.180]  Now, it's give it to little children.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:23.880]  Come on!
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.561]  It never ends.
[01:29:24.661 --> 01:29:25.322]  And pregnant women.
[01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:28.423]  Because they want to kill the next generation or make them infertile.
[01:29:28.443 --> 01:29:30.323]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:29:30.463 --> 01:29:37.084]  Bill Gates went out and euthanized himself, jumped in a lake of liquid nitrogen or something, or shot himself off in a rocket.
[01:29:37.424 --> 01:29:40.365]  I would respect him, but no, he wants the earth for himself.
[01:29:41.525 --> 01:29:46.626]  But I will say this, if the public doesn't get upset about this and say no, if governors don't take action, we deserve it.
[01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:48.707]  They are doing this to us.
[01:29:49.741 --> 01:29:53.225]  And we put out enough information and people know how to make it go viral.
[01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:56.589]  So you deserve what you get if you don't do anything.
[01:29:56.749 --> 01:29:58.511]  Yeah, it's not enough if you don't pitch a fit.
[01:29:58.631 --> 01:30:01.815]  And we could have easily just buried this or just kept it for ourselves.
[01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:08.762]  We chose to put ourselves on the line to share this information because whoever reads this or even just watches this video, you may save that person's life.
[01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:09.864]  And that's real.
[01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:14.128]  And of course, if they even respond to it, the enemy will target this or target little parts of that.
[01:30:14.949 --> 01:30:18.052]  The documents give the diseases the same names, timelines.
[01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:20.374]  It's all how to counter us, how to do it.
[01:30:20.734 --> 01:30:21.896]  It's all right there.
[01:30:21.976 --> 01:30:23.097]  I'm going to say this in closing.
[01:30:23.697 --> 01:30:24.678]  Word of mouth is king.
[01:30:24.779 --> 01:30:25.679]  I just want to win the war.
[01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:26.740]  Plus we need financial support.
[01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:35.893]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com today and whether you are worried about what's going on or not, everybody needs all the vitamins and all the minerals and all the amino acids.
[01:30:36.134 --> 01:30:39.755]  We have a great multivitamin, multimineral amino acid drink.
[01:30:39.995 --> 01:30:40.595]  People love it.
[01:30:40.675 --> 01:30:41.616]  It's selling out right now.
[01:30:41.696 --> 01:30:42.756]  We're still at 40% off.
[01:30:43.136 --> 01:30:44.177]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:30:44.557 --> 01:30:45.578]  We have a great sleep aid.
[01:30:45.638 --> 01:30:47.079]  Rocket Rest has been sold out for four months.
[01:30:47.399 --> 01:30:48.059]  Back in stock.
[01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:51.961]  Four milligrams of melatonin and just a bunch of other great stuff.
[01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:55.503]  Really helps you get deep, restful sleep with all the stuff that's in the environment.
[01:30:55.823 --> 01:30:56.764]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:57.965]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:30:58.005 --> 01:31:02.727]  But I'm going to be streaming this and restreaming it until I'm live tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[01:31:02.767 --> 01:31:03.167]  Central.
[01:31:03.748 --> 01:31:05.088]  Please get this out.
[01:31:05.369 --> 01:31:07.490]  Your email list, your text message, your word of mouth.
[01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:16.876]  And say, here is the massive proof that COVID was staged, that it's a takeover, and that the vaccine is going to kill people and cause absolute destruction en masse.
[01:31:16.896 --> 01:31:18.117]  We've said a lot, but both of you.
[01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:19.278]  60-second closing comment.
[01:31:19.318 --> 01:31:19.598]  Rob Dew.
[01:31:20.617 --> 01:31:21.338]  Share this video.
[01:31:21.478 --> 01:31:22.198]  Share this video.
[01:31:22.218 --> 01:31:23.039]  That's all you can do.
[01:31:23.279 --> 01:31:25.240]  Share this video and read this document for yourself.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.661]  Because you don't have to believe any of us.
[01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:27.861]  You don't have to believe our takes on it.
[01:31:28.302 --> 01:31:28.942]  Read the document.
[01:31:28.982 --> 01:31:30.043]  It's all going to come out to you.
[01:31:30.363 --> 01:31:34.645]  It's all going to be hitting you right in the face as you're looking at it going, damn, this happened to my dad.
[01:31:35.065 --> 01:31:36.586]  Oh damn, this happened to my cousin.
[01:31:36.967 --> 01:31:37.267]  Damn.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.482]  What else is going to happen next?
[01:31:40.003 --> 01:31:40.663]  Read this document.
[01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:41.665]  It tells you what happens next.
[01:31:41.765 --> 01:31:42.746]  It's all in the document.
[01:31:43.067 --> 01:31:43.648]  So check it out.
[01:31:43.848 --> 01:31:45.831]  The Spars Pandemic 2025 to 2020.
[01:31:46.391 --> 01:31:48.074]  Our life expectancy is imploding.
[01:31:48.474 --> 01:31:49.976]  Our infant mortality is exploding.
[01:31:50.016 --> 01:31:50.938]  We're being murdered.
[01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:59.593]  Yeah, closing statement for me is that Alex, you know, 10 years ago you released the Rockefeller document, the lockstep.
[01:31:59.613 --> 01:32:00.734]  You put yourself on the line.
[01:32:00.774 --> 01:32:01.634]  You put that out there.
[01:32:02.154 --> 01:32:05.877]  Everyone who's watching this, listening to this, can be that person for this.
[01:32:05.917 --> 01:32:12.722]  We've put together Crimson Contagion, Event 201, and SPARS, all in one cohesive show for you to share.
[01:32:12.762 --> 01:32:13.902]  Please get this information now.
[01:32:13.942 --> 01:32:14.763]  You may save someone's life.
[01:32:15.664 --> 01:32:16.064]  That's right.
[01:32:16.124 --> 01:32:17.465]  Alright, fabulous job crew.
[01:32:17.605 --> 01:32:19.026]  I'm going to tell everybody this is going to air it.
[01:32:20.714 --> 01:32:23.536]  Five o'clock, we get this done in two hours, guys, or get it done at six?
[01:32:23.676 --> 01:32:24.076]  What do you want?
[01:32:25.237 --> 01:32:27.159]  Want to stream this at five or stream this at six?
[01:32:30.841 --> 01:32:31.782]  We'll stream this at six.
[01:32:31.882 --> 01:32:32.162]  All right.
[01:32:32.543 --> 01:32:33.363]  Hey, I love you all.
[01:32:33.483 --> 01:32:34.304]  I appreciate you.
[01:32:34.684 --> 01:32:35.625]  The ball's in your court.
[01:32:35.645 --> 01:32:42.230]  If you don't care about your own life, your own future, at least care about children, research this information, find out it's true, and then take action.
[01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.170]  God bless and good luck.
[01:32:44.531 --> 01:32:45.372]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:32:46.809 --> 01:32:48.110]  Keep us on air.
[01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:50.631]  We'll continue to bring you the band guests.
[01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:54.233]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[01:32:54.253 --> 01:32:56.575]  I'm going to get to some of that coming up here in the third hour.
[01:32:56.975 --> 01:32:57.675]  Keep us on air.
[01:32:57.755 --> 01:32:59.016]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:59.276 --> 01:33:02.198]  We're really excited to announce this and quite frankly, I'm thrilled.
[01:33:02.698 --> 01:33:04.519]  We have a new sleep aid.
[01:33:04.639 --> 01:33:06.640]  We can't get enough sleep aids as far as I'm concerned.
[01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:09.022]  A new sleep aid at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:33:09.122 --> 01:33:10.563]  Down and out sleep support.
[01:33:10.603 --> 01:33:12.464]  This is a liquid tincture.
[01:33:13.953 --> 01:33:27.682]  Pretty much similar to the Rocket Rest that is so popular, but this is an illiquid tincture formula, so a little more easily absorbable, and the effects will be probably quicker.
[01:33:29.343 --> 01:33:31.484]  But I'm going to test this out for myself, and I'll give you a review.
[01:33:31.504 --> 01:33:35.747]  But a new Sleep Aid, down and out, is on sale at Infowarstore.com.
