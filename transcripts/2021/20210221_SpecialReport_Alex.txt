[00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.106]  Mark your calendars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:06.570]  We now know who pre-planned the attack on the U.S.
[00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.131]  Capitol from their own words.
[00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:11.274]  Because again, criminals love to brag.
[00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:20.100]  I never thought I'd be in a real live episode of Magnum P.I.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.901]  or Columbo.
[00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.443]  I guess Perry Mason comes to mind?
[00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:24.364]  But I am.
[00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.947]  National headlines everywhere the last two days.
[00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:36.709]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone under criminal investigation to see if we pre-planned the Capitol insurrection attack.
[00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.911]  Now let's unpack that here for just a moment and then I'm going to give you the big news.
[00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:45.512]  We actually know exactly who carried out the pre-planning
[00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:54.364]  of the Capitol attack on January 6 and we have it from their own words in print and on video and with audio.
[00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:55.227]  We're going to show you.
[00:00:56.107 --> 00:01:01.432]  Who took credit and who got $70,000 from CNN and from NBC.
[00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.474]  So that's all coming up in a moment.
[00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:17.067]  But first let me briefly address the claim by the Washington Post and others that Roger Stone and myself are some of the chief suspects in the pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:36.744]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:48.938]  We were told by all the Democratic leaders, by the entire corporate media, not just here but across the world, that President Trump summoned a mob of a million violent criminals to D.C.
[00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.260]  to illegally challenge a U.S.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.680]  election.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.701]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:01:53.221 --> 00:02:02.087]  And that he then directed them to attack the Capitol and all one million went in and ransacked and murdered people and it was the most violent thing to happen on U.S.
[00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:03.589]  soil since Pearl Harbor.
[00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:06.230]  Chuckie Schumer and others called it Pearl Harbor.
[00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.990]  They compared it to World War II.
[00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.431]  They compared it to 9-11.
[00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.171]  And they said that, again, it was not premeditated.
[00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:20.834]  President Trump was the only one that premeditated it by getting that crowd there and then hyping them up as a rabble rouser to attack the building.
[00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.253]  But he was acquitted over a week ago in the U.S.
[00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.014]  Senate because there was no evidence of this.
[00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:32.317]  They played all the video of the Democrats standing up there saying things far worse than Trump even dreamed of saying.
[00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.419]  Like Cuomo saying, whoever said riots are peaceful?
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.542]  And Pelosi saying burning things down is just what people do.
[00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:46.087]  President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.
[00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:50.470]  Unfortunately, we can now add January 6th,
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.464]  And please, show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:59.327]  There's hundreds of those clips, we all know them.
[00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:01.810]  And so they had to acquit him.
[00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:23.558]  And the ink wasn't dry on Trump's acquittal until they turned around and said, actually, it's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:29.723]  They're the ones that captained and field-martialed this entire operation, and it was premeditated.
[00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.157]  So let's get into the evidence right now.
[00:03:54.315 --> 00:04:03.037]  Coming up, I'm going to show you where the establishment Democrats bragged in Time Magazine just two weeks ago that they indeed set up Trump supporters on the 6th.
[00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:12.180]  But before we get to that piece of smoking gun evidence, let's look at one of the main leaders of the insurrection at the Capitol.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.680]  So how was this lady shot?
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.062]  I mean, she was trying to get through the door, and did you see who shot her?
[00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:34.007]  Yeah so I was getting to that part so immediately after they start breaking through the glass once they broke through the glass they were using like flagpoles and whatever they had to kind of bash through the windows.
[00:04:35.468 --> 00:04:39.952]  On the right hand side this lady was able to like make her way all the way through the window.
[00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.995]  All we see is these guns coming
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.460]  We're good to go.
[00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.655]  She got shot like right in the neck area, fell backwards.
[00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:14.722]  Meet John Sullivan, aka Jaden X. His father is a famous U.S.
[00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:15.502]  military general.
[00:05:16.143 --> 00:05:24.092]  On the morning of January 6th, Jaden X was recorded over and over and over again saying, we're gonna go to the Capitol and we're going to burn it down.
[00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:33.947]  But that didn't stop CNN from saying he was an innocent bystander and a journalist.
[00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.729]  And it didn't stop CNN and other news outlets from secretly paying him $70,000.
[00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.011]  That finally came out in court just last week.
[00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:52.156]  Dude, I was trying to tell you.
[00:05:52.876 --> 00:05:53.737]  I couldn't say much.
[00:05:56.058 --> 00:05:59.240]  You just have to watch my channel.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.201]  Is this not going to be the best film you've ever made in your life?
[00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.364]  The CNN connected film crew that followed Jaden X to the Capitol was blown away.
[00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:11.706]  They couldn't believe that his boast of invading the Capitol and it succeeding came true.
[00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:21.154]  Jaden X had been boasting online and to hundreds of people in the streets that he indeed had helped online plan the attack on the Capitol.
[00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:23.577]  And when confronted with it, he didn't even deny it.
[00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:25.999]  He said that was another one of his personalities.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.262]  You can disassociate yourself.
[00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:30.144]  I am John Sullivan.
[00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:31.545]  I have Jaden X.
[00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:41.268]  That separates, I have Insurgents USA, a civil rights organization, so it separates my, I separate my identity based on the specific role that I'm playing, right?
[00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:44.008]  Then the athlete became an activist.
[00:06:44.288 --> 00:07:01.512]  Arrested after organizing the Provo protest in July of 2020, Sullivan continued posting about organized protests on the Instagram page for his company, Insurgents, a company Sullivan dedicated to ending police brutality and unifying the nation.
[00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:03.133]  My name's John Sullivan.
[00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.215]  I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.417]  My group is Insurgents USA.
[00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:09.498]  We're f***ing about to burn this s*** down.
[00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.942]  We gotta f***ing, we gotta f***ing rip Trump out of that office right over there.
[00:07:13.962 --> 00:07:15.183]  F***ing pull him out that s***.
[00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:23.090]  And it's not just Jaden X. Many other known leftist activists from around the country came to D.C.
[00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.753]  and posed as Trump supporters and helped rile up the crowd.
[00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:35.349]  While Trump was still speaking a mile and a half away at the Ellipse outside the White House, already over 100,000 people had showed up at the Capitol.
[00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:50.487]  And observant patriots noticed that in the grass, in the bushes, behind the trees, people wearing all black, people with anti-fascist style dress and gear were putting on MAGA gear, putting on Trump gear.
[00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:56.809]  And this again is just more evidence of how the left didn't overtly show up to confront Trump supporters that day.
[00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.990]  They simply blended in and added to the hysteria.
[00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:22.407]  In October of last year, investigative journalist Millie Weaver, who had been tracking the Sunrise Project for more than two years, that's basically a college-level, George Soros, Democratic Party-funded group that teaches Antifa and BLM tactics.
[00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:33.393]  Millie got dozens of hours from an inside whistleblower of this organization planning to carry out the exact type of insurrection that then took place on January 6th.
[00:08:34.514 --> 00:09:00.198]  Our undercover inside the Sunrise Movement was able to obtain exclusive video footage inside Zoom chats where Shutdown DC, BLM and other leftist organizations are coordinating a multi-level coup action exercise utilizing insider help from Democrat Party members as well as federal employees and intelligence contractors.
[00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:03.194]  I'm a management and programs analyst.
[00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:06.398]  I work in the national security community.
[00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:12.866]  I spent three and a half years as a contractor at DHS HQ.
[00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:16.911]  If you read the mainstream press, like, they all have Signal accounts.
[00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:19.753]  Text them, leak everything you can.
[00:09:19.773 --> 00:09:26.658]  The journalists I've dealt with have been super ethical in ways to shield me to be the source of the leaks.
[00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:31.942]  Groups on the outside being able to show solidarity with federal workers.
[00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:33.804]  Making sure that we're naming.
[00:09:34.384 --> 00:09:35.825]  What is happening is a coup.
[00:09:35.845 --> 00:09:37.086]  Totally agreed.
[00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:44.431]  In the shutdown DC conversations that I've been having and that's not on the federal side, we also are often saying let's call it a coup.
[00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:53.758]  They plan to shut down Washington DC and other major US cities starting November 4th until Inauguration Day.
[00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.600]  Do we have any plans for how to respond if there's a coup?
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.764]  Come to BLM Plaza anytime after 4 p.m.
[00:10:00.824 --> 00:10:01.565]  on election night.
[00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:05.148]  On the 5th, we're going to shut down the White House.
[00:10:05.328 --> 00:10:09.893]  Map the White House and know every access point so we know we can blockade it.
[00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:14.617]  On the 6th, we're going to shut down larger parts of Washington, D.C.
[00:10:14.837 --> 00:10:17.800]  We've been working on a target map and a framework for scenarios.
[00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:20.223]  So, where are all the police stations?
[00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:22.384]  We're all the key government buildings.
[00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:24.105]  Who are the Trump boosters?
[00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:34.993]  Members of Congress that are coming in, we're going to meet them at the airports or at Union Station and send them back to where they came from until we deal with the situation that we're in.
[00:10:35.313 --> 00:10:39.656]  We are going to be in a crisis, but we want it to be one that we are creating.
[00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:42.238]  Whoever's got the guns can win.
[00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:43.499]  Let's take over the buildings.
[00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:46.721]  If there are people that are willing to do that, we should support them.
[00:10:46.941 --> 00:10:48.723]  Get ready to shut your city down on the 4th or the 5th.
[00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:53.424]  Regardless of who wins, the left plans to take over.
[00:10:53.905 --> 00:11:02.990]  And then, on the night of the 6th, Millie Weaver was able to actually confront Jaden X. Hey, so, were you... Yeah, give me a second, I'm on the phone.
[00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.332]  Are you BLM?
[00:11:06.452 --> 00:11:07.693]  Are you Black Lives Matter?
[00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:15.137]  John, can you just answer, are you Black Lives Matter, with Black Lives Matter, or are you with the right wing people?
[00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:17.539]  Yeah, but, are you Black Lives Matter?
[00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:24.111]  So he just said on the phone that he is not being charged with anything.
[00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:28.696]  Did you say you weren't being charged with anything?
[00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:29.977]  I thought I heard you say that.
[00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.920]  Are you Black Lives Matter, John?
[00:11:35.503 --> 00:11:40.388]  I'm of the opinion that what we saw yesterday was very much by design.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.442]  That we did have agent provocateurs.
[00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:44.063]  Mmm.
[00:11:44.724 --> 00:11:46.406]  And I'm of the opinion that you're one of them.
[00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:47.286]  Interesting.
[00:11:47.747 --> 00:11:49.008]  Really interesting on that.
[00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:50.250]  Why do you think I'm one of them?
[00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.891]  Just because you're who your father is.
[00:11:51.992 --> 00:11:53.293]  Your father's PsyOps, man.
[00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:55.435]  So, you've met my dad, okay?
[00:11:55.836 --> 00:11:59.500]  So... Kind of... further elaborates my point.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.264]  Let me just explain it to you, because... I know we work in the storm department.
[00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:05.380]  I'm on chats.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.481]  I'm on underground chats.
[00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:08.282]  Like, I have my resources.
[00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.263]  I have my resources.
[00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:11.744]  There's not me, but I have people, right?
[00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:15.407]  And I'm not saying some f***ing cop type shit.
[00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:32.659]  I'm saying my people in my organization, Insurgents USA, whose civil rights group that is Black Lives Matter, or if you want to label it in Tifa, because Trump wants to label it in Tifa, but I label myself as Insurgents USA, but for people's context, right?
[00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:36.398]  Yeah, they are in chats.
[00:12:36.438 --> 00:12:40.500]  They can easily give me information on what's going on and same with everybody else.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.961]  But it's a collective of people.
[00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:43.742]  You can disassociate yourself.
[00:12:44.482 --> 00:12:45.623]  I have John Sullivan.
[00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:48.805]  I have Jade and X. That separates.
[00:12:48.905 --> 00:12:51.466]  I have Insurgents USA, a civil rights organization.
[00:12:51.526 --> 00:12:56.809]  So it separates my identity based on the specific role that I'm playing, right?
[00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.330]  Is there really a separation?
[00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.431]  There is a separation.
[00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.172]  There is a separation for sure because
[00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:11.395]  I can't be in a crowd full of Trump supporters and say f*** the police or say the things that I would during my regular activism.
[00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:23.862]  Now we've looked at some of the smoking gun, caught red-handed, bombshell evidence of the Democratic Party, Soros, and the Deep State manipulating the crowd.
[00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:28.705]  We're going to look at one more piece and then we're going to get to the really sad information.
[00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:30.266]  The fact that some of the
[00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:36.672]  Best organizations in the past in this country, when it came to promoting freedom, were infiltrated.
[00:13:37.293 --> 00:13:40.902]  And it's important to go over this and understand the truth of what happened, so it won't happen again.
[00:13:42.108 --> 00:13:54.836]  Observing Antifa over the last decade or so, we know they're funded by the UN, by George Soros, by the Democrats in Deep State to undermine America, attack free speech, and call anybody that doesn't support them a racist and a Nazi.
[00:13:55.276 --> 00:14:02.580]  They are the equivalent of the left's brown shirts, just like Hitler had those as he stormed to power in the early 1930s in Germany.
[00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:11.646]  But we got a document back in January of 2018 from a family member of high-level Antifa when he was taking care of them in his house and was able to
[00:14:12.316 --> 00:14:13.517]  See the shocking information.
[00:14:14.177 --> 00:14:32.929]  And in the documents that are on screen, they talked about how Obama wanted to trigger martial law nationwide back in 2015 and even put troops in Maryland by using Antifa to go out and try to provoke the black community into rioting and burning down police stations and government buildings.
[00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:34.130]  They failed.
[00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:40.354]  And so the chain reaction did not take place and Obama didn't get to stay in office using martial law.
[00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:44.738]  But that's what Antifa are specialists at and experts.
[00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:49.981]  They even have maps when they go into an area of where they're allowed to attack, what they're going to do.
[00:14:50.362 --> 00:15:01.390]  And it's always done in blue cities and blue states where they're actually working with the mayors and chiefs of police to go out and carry out this low intensity terror.
[00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.191]  Knowing that they have a get-out-of-jail-free card and are not going to get in trouble.
[00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:14.232]  And if they do get arrested, the charges are almost always dropped and their bail is paid for by the Democratic Party, George Soros, and of course, Hollywood.
[00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:19.833]  And I want to make clear that I know that there are protests still happening in major cities across the United States.
[00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:23.554]  I'm just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks.
[00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:24.474]  That's right.
[00:15:24.594 --> 00:15:25.574]  But they're not going to stop.
[00:15:25.654 --> 00:15:26.634]  They're not going to stop.
[00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:29.595]  This is a movement, I'm telling you.
[00:15:29.915 --> 00:15:31.055]  They're not going to stop.
[00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:39.770]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.554]  And everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:15:44.635 --> 00:15:46.357]  They're not going to let up, and they should not.
[00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:47.738]  And we should not.
[00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.440]  So think about that.
[00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:56.110]  A couple hundred people go in the Capitol, maybe 20 of them are somewhat violent, defecate on the floor, beat up some police.
[00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.311]  Nobody's defending that.
[00:15:57.911 --> 00:16:02.535]  But they're calling this a Pearl Harbor event, when you had whole swaths of the U.S.
[00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:11.482]  burned down, and you had the now-Vice President helping bail people out that, again, attacked police and burned down police stations.
[00:16:12.223 --> 00:16:13.744]  And we've only scratched the surface here.
[00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:18.868]  You've got a former high-level FBI top security clearance commander.
[00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:19.709]  Of course.
[00:16:28.052 --> 00:16:28.612]  of course.
[00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:01.523]  Now, as Paul Harvey would say, here is the rest of the story.
[00:17:03.024 --> 00:17:04.224]  I like Oath Keepers.
[00:17:04.384 --> 00:17:05.265]  I know Stuart Rhodes.
[00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:06.445]  They have a constitutional mission.
[00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:09.787]  He's a great guy and doesn't want offensive violence.
[00:17:10.107 --> 00:17:11.148]  He wants to defend the Republic.
[00:17:11.188 --> 00:17:12.469]  And most Oath Keepers are great.
[00:17:13.389 --> 00:17:24.335]  But through the Q Movement and through these message boards that Jaden X was talking about, they were able to pose as right-wingers through some of the cut-out militia groups like the Bugaloos and others.
[00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:39.737]  And we're able to go into Oath Keepers, go into Proud Boys, and go into some of the Q groups and actually organize people who believe they were coming to the Capitol waiting for Trump to actually show up and lead them in a takeover of the government.
[00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:49.312]  That was a small minority of the Boogaloos even bought into this, and a small minority of the Proud Boys, and a small minority of the Oath Keepers.
[00:17:49.732 --> 00:18:05.577]  But it was enough out of the million people who were there, and the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Proud Boys and Boogaloo and Oath Keepers, to at least get a dozen and a half or so to take part with Jaden X and the invasion of the Capitol, and the rest is history.
[00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:07.378]  This was a terrible day.
[00:18:08.138 --> 00:18:19.904]  It took the beautiful scene of a million peaceful Trump supporters out there saying, we know that there was election fraud and we want an investigation and turned it into a supposed military attack on the Capitol when it wasn't.
[00:18:20.584 --> 00:18:28.048]  It was a group of psychological operators through the internet and the cue boards and through people on the ground led by Antifa.
[00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:30.409]  I'm not demonizing the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:52.388]  I'm simply pointing out this is a classical takeover operation, similar to what the FBI successfully did in the 1990s, infiltrating militia groups and then leading militia groups into violence and violent plots.
[00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:54.850]  This is what Tsarist Russia did.
[00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.871]  It's what the communists in China do.
[00:18:57.312 --> 00:18:59.133]  It's what Lenin and Stalin and Hitler did.
[00:18:59.613 --> 00:19:09.840]  And when you get involved in politics and situations at this level, you can expect this type of black operation to be the norm and not the exception.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:22.646]  Do not go in there!
[00:19:32.014 --> 00:19:34.496]  What did Nancy Pelosi know and when did she know it?
[00:19:34.896 --> 00:19:45.283]  If this was widely known by the FBI and Capitol Hill police that people were planning to come to Washington before the 6th to create violence, I want to know, did she know about that?
[00:19:45.763 --> 00:19:49.866]  The whole storyline originally was Trump created this from a speech.
[00:19:50.326 --> 00:19:53.889]  Now we know the people had this on their mind before he ever spoke.
[00:19:54.189 --> 00:20:01.674]  In closing, now you know why they ended the Trump impeachment trial for inciting insurrection a week early.
[00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.995]  Why they suddenly dropped it that Saturday afternoon and weren't going to call any witnesses?
[00:20:07.815 --> 00:20:11.916]  Because Lindsey Graham and others have discovered what we have documented.
[00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:25.979]  And that's that Pelosi was given intelligence briefings of exactly this happening two weeks before, a week before, and the day before, and did not even pass it on to high-level ranking Democrats, much less Republicans.
[00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:28.239]  What did Nancy Pelosi know?
[00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:29.985]  And when did she know it?
[00:20:30.626 --> 00:20:32.026]  There should be congressional hearings.
[00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.127]  I'm happy to be called.
[00:20:34.187 --> 00:20:39.149]  There should be congressional hearings about the Big Time Magazine article admitting they knew what was coming.
[00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.711]  And quote, outfoxed us and set us up.
[00:20:44.631 --> 00:20:48.653]  You may have outfoxed us and set us up at this stage of the game.
[00:20:49.613 --> 00:20:53.635]  As Mark Twain said, a lie makes it halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[00:20:54.090 --> 00:21:01.434]  But in the end, the truth almost always wins if there are strong men and women willing to tell the truth and get that truth out there.
[00:21:02.235 --> 00:21:04.456]  So don't forget, what did Nancy Pelosi know?
[00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.116]  When did she know it?
[00:21:05.737 --> 00:21:11.420]  And why did they drop that trial like a hot potato as soon as the Republicans brought out the nuclear option?
[00:21:12.352 --> 00:21:12.532]  Yes.
[00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.479]  Am I worried about being indicted?
[00:21:28.659 --> 00:21:31.200]  Am I worried about being set up in some kangaroo trial?
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.061]  Certainly, if this country's already been in a republic, that may happen.
[00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:37.802]  But I will use any such trial to expose the real perpetrators.
[00:21:38.202 --> 00:21:41.083]  And I stand ready to testify in a criminal trial.
[00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:43.144]  I stand ready to testify to Congress.
[00:21:43.424 --> 00:21:49.366]  And I stand ready to rout this country out of anybody that would attack the Capitol like that, no matter who they are.
[00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:52.787]  Because I'm Alex Jones, a faithful son of this republic.
[00:21:53.507 --> 00:21:58.569]  Just like all of you out there, I will never back down or give in to these tyrants, and I will stand up for our sovereignty.
[00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.851]  So never forget, if you're watching and spreading these reports, you are the resistance.
[00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:22.501]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:22:23.587 --> 00:22:32.511]  It is a fact that in the last 12 years, more than 100 coal-powered plants that were modern and clean-burning were shut down in the state of Texas.
[00:22:33.211 --> 00:22:36.732]  Texas is known as being the energy capital of the United States.
[00:22:37.453 --> 00:22:46.416]  And the United States, under Trump, became the number one exporter of energy in the world, and Texas led that, producing about a third of the energy out of the United States.
[00:22:47.257 --> 00:22:50.398]  But as soon as Biden got in, he signed an executive order
[00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:56.669]  Allowing the Communist Chinese to have access to our grid and to be able to actually attack the grid.
[00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:06.213]  I'm not saying the Communist Chinese attacked the grid, but one week before that ice storm hit Texas in large parts of the Southwest and Southeast,
[00:23:07.253 --> 00:23:13.436]  Biden signed an executive order calling it getting back to a real science that global warming is real.
[00:23:13.736 --> 00:23:15.676]  So we've got to cut off more coal power plants.
[00:23:16.377 --> 00:23:24.220]  Trump was never able to get any of the coal plants that turned off and turned back on because they thought he'd probably be removed from office because he was, quote, a Russian spy.
[00:23:25.663 --> 00:23:32.485]  That's one reason they kept saying he was illegitimate for four years was so that companies wouldn't have confidence to reinvest in the United States.
[00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:39.087]  They're building new coal power plants every week in India, every three days in China, and about every two weeks in Mexico.
[00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:39.847]  Look it up yourself.
[00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:43.508]  And by the way, theirs are totally dirty and don't have any scrubbers on them.
[00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:49.830]  It's just a water turbine that's turned by the coal being burned and then all that toxic waste coming out of the smokestack.
[00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.971]  Here in the United States, the stack only has water vapor and carbon dioxide coming out.
[00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.192]  But the UN listed that as a toxin.
[00:23:57.252 --> 00:23:58.652]  Carbon dioxide, the plants breathe.
[00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:01.553]  So they were able to tax all of this.
[00:24:02.573 --> 00:24:03.914]  That's why Texas is in the dark.
[00:24:04.174 --> 00:24:06.074]  Did they not winterize the nuclear power plant right?
[00:24:06.114 --> 00:24:07.795]  Had to turn one of the reactors off in Houston?
[00:24:07.835 --> 00:24:07.995]  Yeah.
[00:24:08.015 --> 00:24:14.337]  Down on the coast, did they have windmills that supplied half of Austin and those froze up and didn't work?
[00:24:14.497 --> 00:24:14.957]  Absolutely.
[00:24:14.977 --> 00:24:15.737]  The windmills were part of it.
[00:24:16.217 --> 00:24:19.138]  But the lion's share was the fact that over a hundred
[00:24:19.781 --> 00:24:23.942]  Local coal plants that supplied small towns, medium towns, and big cities were shut down.
[00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:27.623]  Austin had two gigantic modern ones built in the 1990s.
[00:24:28.203 --> 00:24:29.263]  They divested of them.
[00:24:29.423 --> 00:24:33.524]  No one bought them because Obama was suing power plant owners.
[00:24:33.824 --> 00:24:36.405]  And they're just sitting there, what, 30 miles south of Austin.
[00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:38.986]  Huge, giant, billion-dollar facility rotting.
[00:24:39.506 --> 00:24:44.567]  There's one more facility left, the Fayetteville plant, that is the only major coal plant still supplying Austin.
[00:24:44.915 --> 00:24:49.457]  The city of Austin has been fighting for years to shut down the Fayetteville facility.
[00:24:49.957 --> 00:24:59.560]  So this is just emblematic of the Globalists trying to make energy expensive in the West so we can't do business and all of our jobs move to Communist China and other authoritarian countries the Globalists control.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.081]  They admit that that is their business plan.
[00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:03.341]  Bill Gates is invested in it.
[00:25:04.082 --> 00:25:05.462]  Warren Buffett is invested in it.
[00:25:05.522 --> 00:25:07.463]  Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, all of them.
[00:25:08.243 --> 00:25:08.763]  Al Gore.
[00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:10.644]  Bill Clinton.
[00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:21.308]  Obama, they're all invested in the carbon trading where you've got to pay them a tax, a private corporate tax worldwide to eat beef or to travel or to have gasoline.
[00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:23.449]  And then they want to quote phase it out.
[00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:25.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is feudalism.
[00:25:25.709 --> 00:25:26.710]  This is economic war.
[00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:33.432]  And that's why InfoWars has been fighting so hard to stop Biden from getting us back on the Paris Climate Accord.
[00:25:33.452 --> 00:25:38.694]  But he just signed back onto it the same day he signed on to let China into our electrical power grid.
[00:25:38.974 --> 00:25:40.375]  China doesn't let us into their power grid.
[00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:41.979]  This is insane.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.180]  So thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.321]  Thank you for spreading the word.

[00:25:52.864 --> 00:25:54.185]  It comes with energy lockdowns.
[00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:55.726]  It comes with brainwashing of your children.
[00:25:56.066 --> 00:25:58.087]  It comes with total modern authoritarianism.
