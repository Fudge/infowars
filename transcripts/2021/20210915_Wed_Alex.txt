[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:06.195]  But we're really settling in here now, in America, aren't we, to being murdered and killed.
[00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:17.206]  And learning that generals call the Chinese and say, Trump's crazy, he tried to overthrow the government two days ago, but don't worry, we'll protect you, trying to self-aggrandize themselves with the Chinese communists.
[00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:23.553]  All that did was make them hate us and not trust us and think, what type of dishonorable criminals run the United States?
[00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:36.692]  So now they've been invading all over and threatening to invade and having ships sail off our coast and threatening to nuke us because they know it's a bunch of sycophantic criminals running the government that would undermine a president that tried to build the nation up.
[00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.433]  Trump was popular in China.
[00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:42.055]  The Communists respected him, by the way.
[00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:46.327]  But they don't respect the likes of Joe Biden and all these criminals.
[00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:49.948]  So these little sellouts that stole the government, they think they're all powerful.
[00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:51.528]  They think they're all super cool.
[00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.369]  They think everybody thinks they're really great.
[00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.149]  But the whole world hates them!
[00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.391]  No one wants to be associated with that.
[00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:00.631]  No one wants to be around that.
[00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:08.133]  No one wants to have to sit there and deal with people like that.
[00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.394]  These are dishonorable trash.
[00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.819]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:46.874]  It's Wednesday, September 15, 2021.
[00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:53.098]  The globalist deep state coup against America has now been exposed.
[00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:55.420]  Treason has been committed.
[00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.844]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.348]  According to the newly released book, Peril, by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, General Mark Milley of the Joint Chiefs of Staff committed treason.
[00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:28.596]  On October 30th of 2020, he made a top-secret phone call to General Li of the Communist Chinese Party, assuring him that the U.S.
[00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:30.457]  was not going to attack China.
[00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:35.263]  And if they ever plan to, he would call ahead of time and let them know.
[00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:47.158]  Milley made a second top secret call on January 8th of 2021, telling his communist handlers that Trump was unstable and made assurances that nothing would happen.
[00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:59.613]  That same day, Milley called a secret emergency meeting at the Pentagon, ordering his subordinates to disobey any orders from the President of the United States without his presence.
[00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:01.376]  This is a U.S.
[00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:04.639]  General at one of the highest levels of our military.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.130]  Working secretly with the Communist Chinese to undermine the lawfully elected President of the United States.
[00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:19.761]  Working secretly with the CCP, a regime that runs death camps and genocides its own people.
[00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:28.637]  Now there is no doubt why he pushes critical race theory, a CCP subversion technique, and plans on purging the military.
[00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:30.719]  He works for the Communist Chinese.
[00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.324]  This is treason at the highest level, in a reasonable world, punishable by death.
[00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.448]  And there is no shortage of domestic enemies in America today.
[00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:43.129]  I would call General Milley a hero.
[00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.410]  He behaved in a heroic manner.
[00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.211]  But what he did was ensure that guardrails were in place.
[00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.152]  So I give him high marks for this based on what's described in the book.
[00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:59.753]  I think Milley felt ill-used by the episode on Lafayette Square when he was used as a prop.
[00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:02.194]  So one can understand Milley's anxieties.
[00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:05.477]  We are in a period of extraordinary danger.
[00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:10.002]  I think General Milley is going to be treated very favorably by history.
[00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:17.871]  And just weeks ago, China was unlawfully sending battleships, including their most lethal, off the coast of Alaska.
[00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:20.433]  Will anyone be warning the U.S.
[00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:22.094]  of a CCP invasion?
[00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:25.015]  Are there any patriots left in the Pentagon?
[00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:36.900]  Former Navy Intelligence Officer Jack Posobiec claims that several Pentagon officers who were present in Milley's secret meeting are now willing to testify against him under oath.
[00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:43.743]  If there is to be any purge of the military, it is only fitting that it should begin with General Mark Milley.
[00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.305]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:05.407]  Even among Democrats.
[00:05:05.627 --> 00:05:08.248]  Watch these statements from just a few months ago.
[00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:10.750]  I don't think it should be mandatory.
[00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.892]  I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.
[00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:17.654]  Just like I don't think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide.
[00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:19.975]  Can we mandate vaccines across the country?
[00:05:20.116 --> 00:05:24.118]  No, that's not a role that the federal government, I think, even has the power to make.
[00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:27.420]  We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.441]  That's just not what we can do.
[00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:33.864]  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't.
[00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.330]  No, definitely not.
[00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.453]  You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine.
[00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:40.434]  We've never done that.
[00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:44.437]  We don't want to be mandating from the federal government to the general population.
[00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.160]  It would be unenforceable and not appropriate.
[00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.263]  So things are changing so quickly that the population is becoming numb to what the state of affairs was just the other day.
[00:05:54.323 --> 00:06:00.188]  For a quick recap, a year ago, they were telling you, maybe you shouldn't take the vaccine because Trump created it.
[00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:07.373]  A few months ago, they were assuring you, Nancy Pelosi in April assured you, we're never going to require vaccines because we can't do that.
[00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:08.314]  We don't have the power.
[00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:12.797]  Your medical status is a matter, a sacred matter of privacy.
[00:06:13.258 --> 00:06:14.138]  Again, that was in April.
[00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:16.420]  On Thursday, they required vaccines.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.481]  Here's where we are today.
[00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:19.946]  I would support that.
[00:06:19.986 --> 00:06:24.148]  If you want to get on a plane and travel with other people, then you should be vaccinated.
[00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:25.809]  Flying on an airplane remains a hazard.
[00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.772]  No one knows the vaccination status of any of the fellow passengers.
[00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:31.753]  You're locked in this tube.
[00:06:32.774 --> 00:06:34.755]  And it's a privilege to travel.
[00:06:35.215 --> 00:06:36.936]  There's more mandates I wish you would have given.
[00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:43.901]  I think mandating vaccines for air travel, train travel, or interstate.
[00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:45.562]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:52.428]  We are live, at least for the time being, on this Wednesday, September 15th, worldwide transmission.
[00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:53.809]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:03.613]  Again, with incredible frustration, we are the only people that know exactly what happened with General Milley and laid it out already.
[00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:10.016]  Because this was already in the news, it already developed, we already had sources back at the time of January 6th.
[00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:13.778]  And so, I'm sitting here,
[00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:20.769]  As all of this unfolds, watching our country already under a globalist coup.
[00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:24.131]  It wasn't that Milley was trying to carry out a coup.
[00:07:24.672 --> 00:07:27.574]  There was already a coup where they wouldn't follow what Trump said.
[00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:29.155]  They would throw away his executive orders.
[00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:39.222]  They refused to pull troops out of Syria and out of Afghanistan and everywhere else.
[00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:47.097]  And this is a bureaucracy that's running the country in the ground that's already sold the nation out.
[00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:49.758]  So I'm too angry at this point to do the show.
[00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:51.158]  It's not a dramatic effect.
[00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:52.819]  I just, I gotta restart the show.
[00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:55.320]  So we're gonna go to some tapes.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.840]  I may not even come back.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.021]  I mean, it's just, we're not a serious people.
[00:08:03.862 --> 00:08:05.723]  We don't understand what we're up against.
[00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:08.184]  And that's why we're getting destroyed.
[00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:10.965]  And we're seeing the worst scum of the earth
[00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:13.125]  Taking control of the country.
[00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:15.906]  I'm going to restart the show at the next segment.
[00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:28.849]  Don't worry, we've got a lot of important special reports, but I've got to just clear my mind because this stuff is so big, so earth-shattering, so important, so over the top, that it just can't be done half-ass.
[00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.990]  It's got to be done with exact precision.
[00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.811]  And so I'm going to do the best job I can when we come back to do it.
[00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:41.432]  We've got a lot of really important doctors and
[00:08:43.277 --> 00:08:50.118]  Scientists and people that need to be heard from on the whole COVID martial law takeover as well.
[00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.419]  And so we're going to air some of those reports here.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.420]  You know, maybe I should just leave today.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.101]  Maybe I should just leave today.
[00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:07.042]  Not to walk off the show, but just to note how serious things are.
[00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:14.850]  Your government walked off a long time ago and is run by foreign criminals that are actually waging war against us and literally killing everybody.
[00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.993]  I've got reports here that I've confirmed in the statistics.
[00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:27.720]  I looked it up for two hours last night, an hour this morning, that all over the country cancers being reported are up more than 10 times.
[00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.283]  And so maybe that's my problem.
[00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:32.684]  Maybe I'm over preparing.
[00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:41.651]  But you understand that the people running our government, running the Pentagon, running Big Pharma, are in a war.
[00:09:42.071 --> 00:09:45.573]  It's only Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, and the U.S.
[00:09:45.593 --> 00:09:47.595]  being hit with these mRNA poison shots.
[00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:49.916]  Everybody else gets a regular vaccine.
[00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:51.798]  They have their problems, but nothing like this.
[00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:53.579]  I mean, you understand that?
[00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:54.539]  You understand?
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.920]  They're killing you.
[00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:58.962]  They see you as their enemy.
[00:09:59.883 --> 00:10:00.944]  I wonder if that clip's on here.
[00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:01.564]  I know I sent it.
[00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:02.425]  Here, let's just read the headlines.
[00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:08.405]  There's over 750,000 sex offenders in the U.S.
[00:10:08.945 --> 00:10:14.668]  and none of them have to show any proof of being registered, but you're going to have to show one to go to a bar or hospital or get on a plane.
[00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.309]  That's pretty big.
[00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:29.635]  We got Andrew Reid, Evan Pugh, professor of biology and epidemiology at Penn State on Marek's disease, which I've been saying is a huge deal and it's creating like a Marek's-like effect in humans.
[00:10:29.655 --> 00:10:30.455]  We're going to get to that clip.
[00:10:30.495 --> 00:10:31.316]  It's incredibly important.
[00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:36.795]  We got Marek's disease part two, that's really important.
[00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:45.621]  And we just got dozens and dozens of these clips I sent over to the crew here, just listing how they're doing it to us.
[00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:51.605]  And I didn't have time, today I got here late, I didn't have time to know if I had the clip with the scientist.
[00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:58.730]  It's a LifeSiteNews, front page, InfoWars.com, 20 plus times more likely to get cancer than those that got the injection.
[00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:01.835]  Let's just read all the list here on air.
[00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:02.456]  We'll do it that way.
[00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:09.397]  My vitamins don't work if you don't take yours.
[00:11:09.457 --> 00:11:11.718]  Just like my vaccine doesn't work if you don't take yours.
[00:11:12.258 --> 00:11:17.820]  British professor sounds off on Pfizer, paying out biggest fine in history for bribing doctors.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.520]  That's really big.
[00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:25.822]  Doctors refuse to carry out a COVID antibody test.
[00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.812]  Because they're just saying natural immunity doesn't exist now.
[00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:29.472]  Total lies.
[00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:30.713]  They're saying the sun doesn't exist.
[00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:34.036]  Former President Trump reacts to new reports about General Milley.
[00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:34.796]  That's really important.
[00:11:34.816 --> 00:11:35.777]  We'll be getting to that early.
[00:11:36.898 --> 00:11:42.282]  Senator Rice questions Blinken on who's controlling Biden and how they keep turning his mic off.
[00:11:42.462 --> 00:11:43.683]  He just lies to him and denies it.
[00:11:44.864 --> 00:11:53.891]  Another huge statement by top doctor in Israel on national TV saying that they're seeing way more people sick and sick longer and dying that have had the vaccine.
[00:11:53.931 --> 00:11:55.172]  That's on national TV.
[00:11:55.392 --> 00:11:55.772]  That's clip 22.
[00:11:58.004 --> 00:12:04.150]  And it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on here.
[00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:14.519]  But the one I want, it's not on there, let me show you, is on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:18.800]  There's an article on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.323]  Doctor reports 20 plus fold increase in cancer in his patients.
[00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:29.506]  He has a major diagnostics lab that goes in and does the biopsies and does the tests.
[00:12:29.706 --> 00:12:32.728]  And they've got more business than they could ever have.
[00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:33.108]  You know what?
[00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:34.829]  We won't get to Mellie.
[00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.772]  We're going to get to that when we come back here today.
[00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.411]  But we're really settling in here now, in America, aren't we?
[00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:49.971]  To be murdered and killed.
[00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:57.273]  And learning that generals call the Chinese and say, Trump's crazy, he tried to overthrow the government two days ago, but don't worry, we'll protect you.
[00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.994]  Trying to self-aggrandize themselves with the Chinese Communists.
[00:13:01.034 --> 00:13:07.336]  All that did was made them hate us and not trust us and think, what type of dishonorable criminals run the United States?
[00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:20.476]  So now they've been invading all over and threatening to invade and having ships sail off our coast and threatening to nuke us because they know it's a bunch of sycophantic criminals running the government that would undermine a president that tried to build the nation up.
[00:13:21.657 --> 00:13:23.217]  Trump was popular in China.
[00:13:23.457 --> 00:13:25.838]  The communists respected him, by the way.
[00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:30.132]  But they don't respect the likes of Joe Biden and all these criminals.
[00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:33.753]  So these little sellouts that stole the government, they think they're all powerful.
[00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:35.333]  They think they're all super cool.
[00:13:35.573 --> 00:13:37.174]  They think everybody thinks they're really great.
[00:13:37.414 --> 00:13:38.934]  But the whole world hates them!
[00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:43.236]  No one wants to be associated with that.
[00:13:43.296 --> 00:13:44.416]  No one wants to be around that.
[00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:51.938]  No one wants to have to sit there and deal with people like that.
[00:13:51.978 --> 00:13:54.179]  These are dishonorable trash.
[00:13:55.725 --> 00:14:05.370]  That have taken over our country, and who see the people they stole the nation from as their enemy, because we are the rightful heirs to this republic.
[00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:13.234]  We the people, who they're poisoning with cancer-causing shots, that don't worry, you're not gonna have to wait a year to get cancer from your COVID shots.
[00:14:13.254 --> 00:14:16.636]  A lot of people are getting cancer within weeks.
[00:14:18.397 --> 00:14:23.039]  And that's what the diagnostic labs that are doing the biopsies are seeing, so we've got that.
[00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:27.851]  And so, that's what we've got here.
[00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:35.093]  This whole Milley thing, maybe we can put the show headline up from the broadcast, from InfoWars.com, the show headline for the show today.
[00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:41.794]  And if you pull it up on InfoWars.com, you just go to InfoWars.com, and it says, Global Exclusive.
[00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:48.396]  General Milley was part of a larger coup operation being prepared by the deep state against Trump.
[00:14:49.796 --> 00:14:53.377]  Nancy Pelosi has confirmed that top Democrats working
[00:14:54.653 --> 00:15:01.005]  With traitors in the Pentagon had prepared a plan to remove Trump from office if he didn't step down.
[00:15:02.248 --> 00:15:05.794]  Milley was developing the fake pretext
[00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:21.268]  With the false story that Trump was preparing to attack China with no evidence of that, which is the contrary, to operate the cover of the coup they were setting up.
[00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:22.910]  Isn't that a big deal?
[00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.193]  And did you know yesterday when I saw this break,
[00:15:26.138 --> 00:15:29.861]  Towards the end of the show, I went, wait a minute, I remember Pelosi talking about, don't worry, the nukes are safe.
[00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:33.784]  I talked to Milley on TV on January 8th, sure as hell it was in CNN.
[00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:36.246]  And then now the media's like, oh, it's true.
[00:15:36.547 --> 00:15:37.667]  He's a hero.
[00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:41.811]  They made that all up, that Trump was about to launch a nuclear war with no evidence.
[00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:46.214]  So in case they had to go take him out, that was going to be their cover, that they saved the world.
[00:15:46.735 --> 00:15:50.438]  When they're the ones endangering the whole world, they're the ones that are treasonous maggots.
[00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:51.999]  They're all a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:53.620]  I mean, that's, give me a break.
[00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:59.443]  So for decades I studied the globalist plan and had seen them tested around the world.
[00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:04.685]  I knew they were going to roll it out through poison vaccines was their main battle plan.
[00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:06.606]  They war-gamed a lot of scenarios.
[00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:20.992]  And now I'm sitting here watching it unfold and watching massive increases in cancer, massive increases in heart attacks and blood clots and all these illnesses and knowing what it did in the rat studies and I'm very angry and I'm very horrified.
[00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:23.093]  So I
[00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:26.493]  Really am having trouble doing this show right now.
[00:16:27.513 --> 00:16:28.273]  There's the headline.
[00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:35.375]  Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase in cancer in vaccinated patients.
[00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:50.559]  I'm going to tell you all about that coming up in two segments, and then I'm going to lay a ton of news and information out ahead of all of the other big developments that we're going to be having here today.
[00:16:53.373 --> 00:17:10.347]  But when it comes to this Millie situation, I am so upset, because it just confirms our worst analysis, that I am ashamed of my country.
[00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.869]  What we've become.
[00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.331]  We're just drunk on entertainment, drunk on
[00:17:16.516 --> 00:17:16.996]  Drugs.
[00:17:17.997 --> 00:17:19.738]  We are completely far away from God.
[00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:20.938]  Our churches are captured.
[00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:25.681]  And then you look at that sack of un-American filth.
[00:17:27.642 --> 00:17:31.224]  That America-hating leftist poser.
[00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:33.625]  He's like Brian Stelter in a uniform.
[00:17:36.487 --> 00:17:38.288]  And that's who the globalists put in there.
[00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.930]  That's who they maneuvered in there because he's just so bad.
[00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:48.631]  Then if I just get up here and talk about this, nobody cares.
[00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:49.651]  Nobody cares.
[00:17:50.992 --> 00:17:59.236]  I mean, if I built it up for three, four days and then said, I'm going to tell you what's really going on, we'd have an extra 5 million people tuning in, people would actually care, they'd pass it around.
[00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.658]  But if I just lay this out, you know what?
[00:18:01.718 --> 00:18:03.118]  I'm not going to tell you what's going on with Millie.
[00:18:03.258 --> 00:18:03.739]  How about that?
[00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:06.780]  People tend to like to not know the truth.
[00:18:07.181 --> 00:18:08.601]  They all think it's fun to be ignorant.
[00:18:09.202 --> 00:18:09.962]  We just won't go there.
[00:18:10.082 --> 00:18:11.603]  I'm not going to talk about Millie.
[00:18:12.998 --> 00:18:16.121]  Let's talk about, here, let's just look at an info or stack of news right here.
[00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:18.063]  Let's do that.
[00:18:19.885 --> 00:18:21.847]  Gavin Newsom stole the election in California.
[00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:24.670]  Yeah, total psychopath liar, piece of garbage.
[00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:31.877]  Mayor demands school board resign over or be charged over dissemination of child pornography material.
[00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:34.040]  They'll all get rewards.
[00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.831]  We've got General Milley and all his criminal activity.
[00:18:38.991 --> 00:18:43.812]  Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase of cancer in vaccinated patients.
[00:18:43.833 --> 00:18:44.793]  Let's just go ahead and cover that.
[00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:51.415]  A doctor has found an increase in cancer since the COVID-19 inoculation rollout.
[00:18:53.183 --> 00:19:18.698]  Back on March 18th, Dr. Ryan Cole, a board-certified pathologist and owner of, I want to get on, an operator of a diagnostics lab, reported to the public in a video, now much worse stuff's been discovered, produced by Idaho State Government's Capital Clarity Project, that he is seeing a massive uptick in various autoimmune diseases and cancers in patients who have been, quote, vaccinated, which is what happened at the University of Texas Fauci-funded study in 2012 on rats.
[00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:34.420]  Since January 1st, the laboratory, I'm seeing a 20 times increase of endomaterial cancers over what I see on an annual basis, reported Dr. Cole in a video clip shared on Twitter.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.181]  We have the original one from March.
[00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:37.042]  We have its new video.
[00:19:37.062 --> 00:19:39.564]  We're going to play both those for you here today.
[00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.127]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:48.611]  He's like, gosh, I've never seen this many.
[00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:52.904]  Indomaterial cancers before, he continued.
[00:19:53.525 --> 00:20:05.180]  Explaining his findings at a March 18 event, Cole told Iowans that the vaccine seemed to be causing serious autoimmune issues in a way he described as a reverse of HIV.
[00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.203]  It doesn't kill your
[00:20:08.953 --> 00:20:10.995]  You know what we'll do?
[00:20:36.052 --> 00:20:39.554]  We'll play all these doctors next segment, and let me see my guest today.
[00:20:41.656 --> 00:20:41.816]  Hmm.
[00:20:43.377 --> 00:20:44.698]  Andrew Torb is a great guy.
[00:20:45.258 --> 00:20:46.699]  He's fighting back against the Globalist.
[00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:54.665]  He's going to be here, and then Jay Dyer in the fourth hour, really an expert on the Great Reset and the New World Order Zone admissions, what they're going to do to you and your family.
[00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:03.972]  And then I will get into Millie in the second hour.
[00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:10.514]  Because I had a whole prepared analysis, all the points.
[00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:12.574]  And the way I do it is it's all loaded in my mind.
[00:21:12.594 --> 00:21:18.576]  But then sometimes if I've got too much going on in the morning, I don't have time to line it all up.
[00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:28.280]  And so then it just, and I mean, it's all really there, but I want to really lay it out properly and really give you a powerful analysis.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.001]  And that just disappeared into the ether.
[00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:34.982]  So, and really what it is is my anger.
[00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:39.134]  I'm just telling you, I can walk off and leave.
[00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:46.421]  I'm just being honest here that I want to smash this desk and I don't want to keep doing this because, you know, we're not really supposed to just sit here and talk about what they're doing to us.
[00:21:46.441 --> 00:21:49.124]  I mean, they are murdering us, poisoning us, killing us.
[00:21:49.344 --> 00:21:57.913]  This is a military operation led by sacks of filth like Brian Stelter and Millie, all of them cowardly little nothings, not even men.
[00:21:59.838 --> 00:22:02.500]  I mean, I'll just tell you, their actions are horrible and evil.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.002]  They're raping Americans all in the country out and lying and persecuting and censoring and fraud.
[00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:13.766]  But the reason I'm really mad is when I see the analysis of what Milley did.
[00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:16.148]  Oh, it's treason.
[00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:18.489]  Oh, he called our enemies and said, we're going to attack.
[00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:19.610]  I'll tell you that's illegal.
[00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.470]  Yeah, he should be arrested.
[00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:23.612]  But you know, he's not going to be because they're rubbing it in right now.
[00:22:23.932 --> 00:22:24.813]  They put this out.
[00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:26.614]  They want to let you know there's a coup.
[00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:31.714]  They're rubbing you in it, but it's far worse than that.
[00:22:34.836 --> 00:22:39.700]  It was part of a larger coup plan they had where Trump was told, you've got to leave or we're going to remove you.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.082]  And that basically came out and Trump basically said that.
[00:22:42.383 --> 00:22:54.893]  And then we all sat there and got mad at Trump when it was us as a country that allowed this level of garbage to install itself like cancer throughout every strategy, every strategy, every strata of this country.
[00:22:56.343 --> 00:22:57.925]  So I'm just going to control myself here.
[00:22:58.205 --> 00:22:59.306]  I may not be able to come back today.
[00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:00.687]  I'm going to, during the break, I'm going to decide.
[00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.130]  I may just need to go for a hike or something.
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.713]  And, you know, we're a curse nation.
[00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:12.659]  So the issue is all the people serving this are going to be destroyed just as much as we are.
[00:23:13.821 --> 00:23:14.822]  So at one level,
[00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:18.655]  It just is what it is, isn't it?
[00:23:18.675 --> 00:23:31.782]  I mean, you understand that my phone lines load up, and I know a bunch of medical doctors, and I know the head of a major biotech company, one of the biggest here in Austin, and they all know this behind the scenes, but no one will speak up.
[00:23:32.302 --> 00:23:37.665]  I mean, cancer oncology wards have never had this many people, and they've all been injected.
[00:23:39.844 --> 00:23:41.265]  They're murdering everybody!
[00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:52.510]  And we're going to sit here like Aztecs or Babylonians or Druids and just let them sacrifice all of us because they're the authorities and we've got to kiss their ass and we live under Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:57.052]  So, I'm in a dark mood right now.
[00:23:57.072 --> 00:23:58.673]  I mean, just looking at Millie.
[00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:02.120]  The same thing I say about Stelter, I say about him.
[00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:10.386]  I was going to cash somebody for a movie as a villain that kidnaps children and eats them in a gutter somewhere, like, hit the clown, no makeup needed, you've got Millie.
[00:24:10.426 --> 00:24:14.449]  And then the book cover fits what's on the inside, a monstrous piece of filth.
[00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:18.352]  Alright, next hour I'm going to lay out the big picture.
[00:24:19.953 --> 00:24:24.997]  And what's insane is, no one is saying this, no one has gotten this, it is not in the news.
[00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:36.654]  Other than, I saw Jack Posobiec pointing it out yesterday, because he's smart, and he worked in naval intelligence, then worked in some other areas, and so he knows how this stuff operates, he's got connections.
[00:24:36.694 --> 00:24:49.539]  But if we don't get out what's really happening, if Congress doesn't get it, if Trump doesn't get it, if Rand Paul doesn't get it, I've seen their statements about this, then what hope do we have?
[00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:52.220]  I mean, I personally told Trump,
[00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:57.863]  When he was president-elect that they're spying on you and using all that information against him.
[00:24:57.903 --> 00:25:05.026]  I told him specifically he was doing it because they had bragged in some of their sub-publications how they were doing it.
[00:25:05.406 --> 00:25:06.506]  And then it turned out it was true.
[00:25:06.986 --> 00:25:08.607]  Well, it turns out these criminals
[00:25:09.974 --> 00:25:15.596]  They bragged how they were preparing to remove Trump, claiming that he wanted to use the nuclear weapons, which wasn't true.
[00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:21.917]  They used that false claim to organize the coup, and Milley had them sign allegiances to him.
[00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:25.238]  I have it all right here, open and shut.
[00:25:25.498 --> 00:25:32.580]  This wasn't just treason to a foreign power, our main adversary, which they tell us the patriots were involved in with Russia, with no evidence.
[00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.221]  This is total evidence.
[00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:37.582]  It's that they were organizing that as a coup.
[00:25:38.968 --> 00:25:43.391]  against Trump and admitted it on NBC News, CNN, and everywhere else!
[00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:47.814]  As soon as I saw the story yesterday, I was like, oh yeah, I remember Pelosi talked about that.
[00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:48.154]  Remember?
[00:25:48.434 --> 00:25:52.077]  They were saying, oh don't worry, after the January 6th, we'll stop him.
[00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:54.399]  You know, we're in control of the military.
[00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:55.699]  They admitted it!
[00:25:57.941 --> 00:25:59.342]  They're the ones that brought it out!
[00:25:59.482 --> 00:26:01.203]  What Bob Woodward's saying is true!
[00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:03.845]  But they're proud of it!
[00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:04.906]  That's what's so
[00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:14.305]  Sick about this, and even if they did this, and Trump was really looking at that because of China threatening places, that's one thing.
[00:26:14.325 --> 00:26:17.606]  But we elected Trump, so that's bypassing our republic.
[00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:18.867]  But he didn't even do that.
[00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:19.767]  It's on record.
[00:26:19.807 --> 00:26:23.029]  He was going into detente with China at that point, and North Korea.
[00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.731]  And of course, Trump responded to that and said, this is crazy!
[00:26:29.912 --> 00:26:31.673]  China was starting to warm up to our deals.
[00:26:31.713 --> 00:26:32.534]  We've made these deals.
[00:26:34.107 --> 00:26:35.427]  So it's beyond serving China.
[00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:36.488]  He serves himself.
[00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:38.988]  He could have triggered a nuclear war calling up.
[00:26:39.228 --> 00:26:41.409]  There had the military said, well, do I launch an attack?
[00:26:41.429 --> 00:26:43.609]  He said, no, I'll let you know if we launch one.
[00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.470]  Well, that's how he said, well, then I may launch an attack.
[00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.411]  And all of our allies are listening in on this call on record.
[00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:51.692]  They're like, what the hell?
[00:26:52.072 --> 00:26:58.113]  And they started calling the NSA and others saying, is there a military coup in America?
[00:26:59.054 --> 00:27:00.414]  Is General Milley the president?
[00:27:01.647 --> 00:27:09.253]  Because you know that's what happened in Rome, 2000, 50 years ago, 60 years ago now, roughly.
[00:27:10.114 --> 00:27:11.995]  Look up when Caesar got killed, folks, I forget.
[00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:15.758]  Like 40-something years before the birth of Christ.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.982]  And it happens in third world countries all the time, you see this.
[00:27:21.022 --> 00:27:23.504]  Well, it happens in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[00:27:23.544 --> 00:27:29.829]  And here it is, happening in America, like we're Myanmar or something.
[00:27:34.229 --> 00:27:36.691]  And what's frightening is they're the ones that are dangerous.
[00:27:39.493 --> 00:27:49.219]  Oh, but he apologized in his photo-op role when Trump walked around the streets and showed the burned-down church and said it was wrong as just a sign of strength.
[00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.180]  He could have called out the military.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:28:01.606]  Oh, but Milley doesn't mind being political when he is on his knees in Congress saying critical race theory is good and white people attacked the Capitol and white people are the main terror threat.
[00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:02.527]  Don't you get it?
[00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:05.922]  I'm going to lay it out next hour.
[00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:19.010]  I'm going to lay out how they're preparing for war and gun confiscation, how they've said we're the main terror threat, how Biden has announced that in his June report, and how they were planning this all day one, even if they couldn't have stolen the election from Trump.
[00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:32.359]  They were planning to have a 25th Amendment coup against him, claiming he was about to start a war with China, because all he did was sign on to standing up to them in the 40-year trade war they were in with us that we never fought back against.
[00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:38.604]  And the globalists had all pre-positioned their investments and everything else they did in China.
[00:28:40.806 --> 00:28:46.329]  And so that's their investment going down when Trump stands up to them and brings jobs back to America.
[00:28:47.369 --> 00:28:48.870]  Trump got us out of Afghanistan.
[00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.251]  Trump was doing peace deals with North Korea.
[00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:53.012]  Trump got us out of Syria.
[00:28:53.372 --> 00:28:54.353]  And Milley, remember?
[00:28:55.728 --> 00:29:03.915]  The Pentagon ignored the President, and the left is celebrating that, and celebrating surveillance, and celebrating censorship.
[00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:11.803]  So we're not... Here's the big announcement, and it's a big announcement, and I'll be honest, I don't ever have problems speaking to a big crowd.
[00:29:12.223 --> 00:29:13.724]  I don't have any anxiety on national TV.
[00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:17.834]  This isn't like a choking or butterflies in my stomach.
[00:29:17.894 --> 00:29:18.814]  It's more like a rage.
[00:29:19.595 --> 00:29:24.497]  I have trouble presenting this because it's not a pride issue.
[00:29:24.977 --> 00:29:28.798]  It makes me mad that they're on top of us and we can't get them off our backs.
[00:29:31.139 --> 00:29:40.543]  We live in a plutocratic oligarchy of bureaucrats and special interest and billionaires and trillion dollar companies that control them.
[00:29:42.003 --> 00:29:43.184]  A society of criminals.
[00:29:44.943 --> 00:29:50.224]  We live in a bureaucratic dictatorship of people that just don't want to be in control.
[00:29:50.704 --> 00:29:59.627]  They fundamentally hate America because the globalists in the last 70 years had to recruit people that hated the country because why would you want to get rid of something so good?
[00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:05.088]  Like free market and self-defense and sovereignty and all of it.
[00:30:05.328 --> 00:30:07.029]  We weren't perfect, but way above everybody else.
[00:30:07.049 --> 00:30:08.189]  5% of the wealth in 1950.
[00:30:08.229 --> 00:30:08.789]  4% of the world population.
[00:30:13.797 --> 00:30:16.720]  50% of the wealth in 1950, 4% of the population.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.261]  We had half the world's wealth.
[00:30:20.683 --> 00:30:23.666]  And it was in the middle class and the average person's hands.
[00:30:23.726 --> 00:30:24.747]  We had created it.
[00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:25.808]  We had generated it.
[00:30:25.848 --> 00:30:31.413]  We had made all these inventions and all these things and been hardworking and it had delivered.
[00:30:32.874 --> 00:30:33.815]  And now what do you have?
[00:30:33.895 --> 00:30:39.540]  Drug addiction, laziness, stupidness, Satanism, pedophilia run amok, a cursed nation.
[00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:43.322]  Because we got fat and happy and let the evil come in and take over.
[00:30:43.722 --> 00:30:46.363]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back with all the COVID news.
[00:30:46.443 --> 00:30:46.863]  It's huge.
[00:30:47.644 --> 00:30:49.084]  A bunch of the COVID news, my God.
[00:30:49.404 --> 00:31:00.128]  And then on the next hour, I'm going to nail Millie and nail it on the wall and just calmly explain the whole track, what happened.
[00:31:00.148 --> 00:31:01.229]  And here's the frustrating part.
[00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:04.250]  We need massive awakening to this.
[00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.566]  Or Millie doesn't get in trouble.
[00:31:07.767 --> 00:31:12.233]  Because you could bring down Millie, you could bring down the whole deep state, the whole criminal cabal.
[00:31:12.253 --> 00:31:17.661]  It's like the string on the sweater that unravels the whole sweater.
[00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.808]  Or it's like you knock a hole in the dam and the water starts coming through and the whole thing breaks down.
[00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:26.209]  But instead, they're like, well, he's a Chinese agent.
[00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:27.030]  He was calling him.
[00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.451]  He's a traitor.
[00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:30.852]  They're like, oh no, he saved us by doing that.
[00:31:31.172 --> 00:31:32.713]  That gives them their fake argument.
[00:31:32.773 --> 00:31:33.054]  No.
[00:31:34.094 --> 00:31:44.641]  He was lying, saying Trump was going to nuke somebody with no evidence to have the military pledge allegiance to him and sign an agreement not to follow the president's orders.
[00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:46.262]  That's the treason.
[00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:47.262]  That's the coup.
[00:31:47.502 --> 00:31:53.106]  And he called Schumer and Pelosi and others to get them on board.
[00:31:54.574 --> 00:31:56.155]  And he with they and they with he!
[00:31:56.475 --> 00:31:57.675]  That's the issue!
[00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:03.838]  That's the, and no one, it's nowhere, no one is talking about Pelosi that I've seen.
[00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:09.981]  Other than the articles from January 8th, Pelosi says she spoke to General Milley about Trump and the nuclear codes.
[00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:16.184]  Do you understand that's why we've got to stay on air despite all the attacks that I don't even get into with you?
[00:32:18.184 --> 00:32:18.965]  So listen to me.
[00:32:19.966 --> 00:32:24.949]  I'm not going to give you the whole backstory and I'm not going to whine and complain about it, but if you want this place to be on air in a year...
[00:32:27.148 --> 00:32:28.608]  I need you to fund us.
[00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:32.389]  I need everybody to go buy the supplements and the water filters and the air filters.
[00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:33.629]  Everybody already needs storable food.
[00:32:34.089 --> 00:32:35.810]  One month, six months, a year, three months.
[00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.990]  We've got provisions you need.
[00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.251]  We've got quality products and we're fighting for you.
[00:32:40.531 --> 00:32:41.911]  And I'm fighting for myself and my family.
[00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:42.691]  I need to stay on air.
[00:32:43.151 --> 00:32:44.132]  And you need these products.
[00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:46.452]  Winter Sun, vitamin D3, highest quality.
[00:32:46.532 --> 00:32:49.153]  Take it under the tongue for your immune system and everything else for your body.
[00:32:49.193 --> 00:32:49.653]  It's essential.
[00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:49.953]  50% off.
[00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.631]  X2 for your immune system, your whole body.
[00:32:54.671 --> 00:32:56.092]  So many people are deficient in iodine.
[00:32:56.112 --> 00:32:57.512]  It's the best deep-earth crystal source.
[00:32:57.793 --> 00:32:58.573]  Nobody's got better.
[00:32:58.833 --> 00:33:00.654]  Nobody's got something as good.
[00:33:01.955 --> 00:33:02.195]  50% off.
[00:33:02.915 --> 00:33:08.058]  Ultra 12, highest quality, vitamin B12, highest grade, taken under the tongue for higher absorption.
[00:33:08.098 --> 00:33:11.960]  Again, immune system, stamina, libido, your mind, your health, everything.
[00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.201]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:33:16.562 --> 00:33:19.483]  And I will continue to fight as hard as I can.
[00:33:19.523 --> 00:33:24.685]  But I tell you, at some point soon, I'm going to tell you about some of the stuff that's going on, but it's strategic.
[00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:26.185]  That is just unbelievable.
[00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:26.765]  It's fine.
[00:33:26.785 --> 00:33:27.446]  I expect that.
[00:33:28.066 --> 00:33:33.188]  But I'm just saying, on every front, they are moving to shut this country down and bully us into submission, and we're not going to do it.
[00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:34.288]  So keep me in the fight!
[00:33:34.988 --> 00:33:36.749]  We also have a new shirt that'll trigger leftists.
[00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:38.730]  I hate Alex Jones to troll him.
[00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.530]  You got to serve somebody.
[00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.771]  And we know the globalists serve.
[00:33:44.963 --> 00:33:48.684]  Commander of this world, as Bob Dylan said, he sold his soul to Satan for power.
[00:33:49.905 --> 00:33:51.685]  Bob Dylan's deadly serious about that.
[00:33:51.705 --> 00:33:54.426]  At least he's honest about it.
[00:33:54.526 --> 00:33:57.528]  He tried to go to Christ, but the devil is just too strong, he says.
[00:33:58.908 --> 00:34:03.950]  Oh, but there is no devil, and the atheists say, most atheists are Satanists, in my experience.
[00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.532]  Now, or they're just fools that had parents that were too religious and abused them so they hate God.
[00:34:11.291 --> 00:34:13.573]  But there is a good force in the universe.
[00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:15.474]  There is a bad force.
[00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:16.775]  The good force made the universe.
[00:34:16.815 --> 00:34:19.597]  The bad force is our free will.
[00:34:20.418 --> 00:34:24.661]  When we choose bad, it manifests that it exists in so many permutations.
[00:34:24.721 --> 00:34:25.421]  It is a spirit.
[00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.242]  It is an entity.
[00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:28.203]  It is a particular creature.
[00:34:29.064 --> 00:34:31.285]  But we've got a little bit of it in all of us, don't we?
[00:34:32.086 --> 00:34:33.847]  When we get into it, we make it stronger.
[00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:36.509]  All right, I'm starting to settle down a little bit.
[00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:37.590]  This Millie thing,
[00:34:41.175 --> 00:34:43.436]  And them killing everybody with these poison shots.
[00:34:44.357 --> 00:34:45.598]  I know you're all going through this too.
[00:34:46.258 --> 00:35:07.592]  I looked at photos of the gentleman we had on the broadcast last week and over the weekend, Ernest Ramirez, his son, Ernest Ramirez Jr., Ernesto Jr., was in good shape, played basketball, you name it, had a giant heart attack and died with no congenital problems, no nothing, he just died from the Pfizer, excuse me, from the Moderna shot.
[00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.131]  He's been censored off GoFundMe.
[00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:23.900]  Cancels grieving father's fundraiser for son after he raised $10,000 to buy ads on the internet and things and warn people about the shots and promote and boost posts about his son so he can warn others.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.281]  It makes him feel better.
[00:35:25.301 --> 00:35:26.001]  I understand it does.
[00:35:26.442 --> 00:35:27.042]  It helps people.
[00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:29.343]  Well, they said you can't do that.
[00:35:29.383 --> 00:35:30.664]  You can't criticize anybody.
[00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:31.365]  We're going to kill you.
[00:35:31.385 --> 00:35:32.385]  We're going to kill your family.
[00:35:33.106 --> 00:35:33.947]  That's the way it is.
[00:35:35.014 --> 00:35:43.121]  You can boost his videos, they're at Banned.Video, but the enemy runs around the clock, and I meant to tell the crew this, but will you guys go to Ernesto's Twitter, please?
[00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:43.702]  He just started.
[00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:46.824]  He had like five followers last week.
[00:35:46.864 --> 00:35:47.845]  It's got thousands now.
[00:35:47.885 --> 00:35:49.467]  Thanks to the listeners going there and supporting him.
[00:35:49.907 --> 00:35:54.091]  He'll probably get banned off there, but at least his son won't go without a fight.
[00:35:55.455 --> 00:35:56.135]  Yeah, scroll down.
[00:35:56.235 --> 00:36:01.317]  It's a picture of his son in the casket with daddy saying goodbye.
[00:36:01.797 --> 00:36:09.721]  I couldn't imagine my 18-year-old son or my 17-year-old daughter or my 13-year-old daughter or my 4-year-old daughter saying bye to them and then closing the coffin.
[00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:12.182]  Because I've been there with grandparents and uncles and stuff.
[00:36:13.402 --> 00:36:15.043]  And it's incredibly hard to do.
[00:36:17.444 --> 00:36:18.284]  It's on the Twitter page.
[00:36:18.304 --> 00:36:18.884]  Here, I'll show it to you.
[00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:23.146]  And so, you know, that's the type of thing
[00:36:24.326 --> 00:36:25.587]  That goes on in this society.
[00:36:25.607 --> 00:36:26.188]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:29.671]  So, let's blow that picture up for TV viewers.
[00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:31.392]  Let's show the dead son.
[00:36:31.832 --> 00:36:32.773]  That's a human being.
[00:36:32.833 --> 00:36:39.039]  That's a real person that was 16 and a single family dad that he'd raised since he was a little boy.
[00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:43.302]  A big, nice family.
[00:36:43.322 --> 00:36:44.283]  Almost all of them veterans.
[00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:46.165]  And now he's in the ground here in Austin.
[00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:49.056]  That's where he's going to stay.
[00:36:49.497 --> 00:36:51.659]  He doesn't get to grow up and get a wife and have children.
[00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:53.881]  He doesn't get to join the army like his daddy.
[00:36:54.162 --> 00:36:55.563]  He doesn't get to climb mountains.
[00:36:55.803 --> 00:36:57.445]  He doesn't get to swim in the ocean.
[00:36:57.625 --> 00:37:09.358]  He doesn't get to see sunsets anymore, because he got murdered by Bill Gates and Fauci, who were aided by all the lawyers, all the politicians, and all the General Millies of the world, and all the slime.
[00:37:10.796 --> 00:37:15.599]  They think they're better than us and think there's too many of us and say they're saving the earth by killing us.
[00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:18.041]  Well, I say then you should take yourselves out first.
[00:37:19.702 --> 00:37:21.143]  You monsters, you killers.
[00:37:22.924 --> 00:37:26.986]  So let's just leave Ernest Jr.
[00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:28.327]  up there with Ernest Sr.
[00:37:28.347 --> 00:37:30.068]  for people to look at if they're TV viewers.
[00:37:30.508 --> 00:37:35.792]  Just go look at the dead, murdered young man.
[00:37:36.492 --> 00:37:37.213]  Look at him!
[00:37:38.053 --> 00:37:38.814]  Look at him!
[00:37:40.003 --> 00:37:45.026]  Instead, you go to Ernest Twitter, and there's leftists attacking, going, your son didn't die of that.
[00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:46.207]  It's safe and effective.
[00:37:46.247 --> 00:37:48.348]  How dare you try to get attention?
[00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:52.791]  Some of them even have names like, I'm with Pfizer.
[00:37:53.151 --> 00:37:55.413]  And you go find out they work for drug companies.
[00:37:57.434 --> 00:37:58.554]  A lot of them are bots.
[00:37:59.935 --> 00:38:02.537]  These are the people that give you the fake news about ivermectin killing you.
[00:38:02.777 --> 00:38:05.219]  They're the ones that get the fake news to get it banned in Australia.
[00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:08.581]  Australia, by the way, can't stand India.
[00:38:09.662 --> 00:38:13.924]  India now has entire cities completely free of any COVID with Ivermectin.
[00:38:14.565 --> 00:38:16.265]  They've declared whole states free of it.
[00:38:17.006 --> 00:38:18.146]  The government issues it.
[00:38:18.427 --> 00:38:23.069]  They're talking about indicting the head health minister who tried to block it for crimes against humanity.
[00:38:26.651 --> 00:38:28.392]  But Ernest was told, you gotta go get it.
[00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:30.737]  Ernest Jr.
[00:38:30.757 --> 00:38:32.617]  was like, yeah, I don't want to ever stay locked in the house.
[00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:34.798]  They followed the directives of the system.
[00:38:35.058 --> 00:38:37.258]  Like his daddy said, I used to trust the government, now I don't.
[00:38:37.498 --> 00:38:39.279]  I love my country, but I hate my government.
[00:38:39.499 --> 00:38:40.479]  I don't trust my government.
[00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:45.480]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, yeah.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.600]  You can put that headline back up.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.580]  There it is for you.
[00:38:52.321 --> 00:38:59.322]  Attar, Prandesh, India announced the state is COVID-free, proving the effectiveness of the deworming drug, Ivermectin.
[00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:02.573]  So let me play this for you.
[00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:14.662]  Idaho doctor reports a 20 times increase of cancer at his cancer diagnostic lab that I looked up is the biggest in his region, not just his city.
[00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:25.209]  So it was a respected lab, diagnostic lab, that tests blood samples, that tests tumors, that tests the samples sent in.
[00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:29.693]  And they're saying, man, we got a 20-fold increase in business, baby.
[00:39:30.686 --> 00:39:36.648]  Of a particular type of cancers that are tied in the rat studies to other coronavirus vaccines.
[00:39:38.328 --> 00:39:51.853]  Because it's these viruses associated with cancer and their spike protein, and now your body's producing at the cellular level, it creates blood clots, it creates cancer, it attacks the testicles, the ovaries, the uterus, and you see it all there.
[00:39:52.113 --> 00:39:57.354]  Oh, and I got articles, mainline news going, oh, yeah, a lot more people are getting cancer.
[00:39:57.714 --> 00:39:59.615]  That's just a side effect of the shot.
[00:40:03.499 --> 00:40:05.661]  So here is the doctor talking about it.
[00:40:06.722 --> 00:40:16.712]  What we're seeing in the laboratory after people get these shots, we're seeing a very concerning locked in low profile of these important killer T cells that you want in your body.
[00:40:16.752 --> 00:40:18.734]  It's almost a reverse HIV.
[00:40:19.154 --> 00:40:22.117]  In HIV, you lose your helper T cells, your CD4 cells.
[00:40:22.638 --> 00:40:27.462]  In this virus post-vaccine, what we're seeing is a drop in your killer T cells, your CD8 cells.
[00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:29.604]  And what do CD8 cells do?
[00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:31.405]  They keep all other viruses in check.
[00:40:31.465 --> 00:40:32.646]  What am I seeing in a laboratory?
[00:40:32.706 --> 00:40:35.668]  I'm seeing an uptick of herpes family viruses.
[00:40:35.748 --> 00:40:36.989]  I'm seeing herpes.
[00:40:37.149 --> 00:40:38.090]  I'm seeing shingles.
[00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.031]  I'm seeing mono.
[00:40:39.531 --> 00:40:45.996]  I'm seeing a huge uptick in human papillomavirus in the cervical biopsies and the cervical pap smears in women.
[00:40:46.636 --> 00:40:51.879]  In addition to that, there's a little infectious bump that kids get called molluscum contagiosum.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.561]  What do you need to keep that in check?
[00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:55.522]  You need CD8 killer T-cells.
[00:40:55.962 --> 00:41:02.186]  I am seeing a 20 times increase in individuals over the age of 50 of this little bump and rash.
[00:41:02.366 --> 00:41:08.110]  That's innocuous, but what it tells me is the immune status of these individuals who have gotten the shot.
[00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.872]  We're literally weakening the immune system of these individuals.
[00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:14.154]  Now, most concerning of all is there's a
[00:41:14.414 --> 00:41:18.677]  What's the pattern of these types of immune cells in the body that keep cancer in check?
[00:41:19.338 --> 00:41:27.565]  Well, since January 1, in the laboratory, I've seen a 20 times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual basis.
[00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.646]  A 20 times increase!
[00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:31.148]  I'm not exaggerating at all.
[00:41:31.728 --> 00:41:37.373]  Because I look at my numbers year over year, I'm like, gosh, I've never seen this many endometrial cancers before.
[00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:40.655]  I'm seeing invasive melanomas in younger patients.
[00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:43.197]  Normally we catch those early and they're thin melanomas.
[00:41:43.598 --> 00:41:47.541]  I'm seeing thick melanomas skyrocketing in the last month or two.
[00:41:47.561 --> 00:41:55.728]  I'm already seeing the early signals and we are modifying the immune system to a weakened state.
[00:41:56.368 --> 00:42:06.011]  Great study out of Germany that looked at these profiles on young individuals after the Pfizer, showing this locked in, and we don't know how long.
[00:42:06.071 --> 00:42:09.893]  Maybe the immune system, you know, is going to regenerate and those ratios will go back up.
[00:42:10.513 --> 00:42:11.693]  But who's studying it?
[00:42:12.293 --> 00:42:13.794]  And where are the long-term trials?
[00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:14.454]  Two months?
[00:42:14.634 --> 00:42:15.214]  Four months?
[00:42:15.294 --> 00:42:16.995]  How long is this profile locked in?
[00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:17.515]  We don't know.
[00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:22.477]  Oh, it's safe and effective, but we didn't do the studies, and now they lied and said they did the studies, and now admit they didn't.
[00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:25.349]  Folks, what was Fauci over?
[00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:28.451]  The HIV program, blocking drugs that help people, what did HIV do?
[00:42:29.212 --> 00:42:34.577]  It killed the T lymphocytes, those are the white blood cells that train the other white blood cells, the killer T's, what to do.
[00:42:35.077 --> 00:42:37.840]  Now they've just hit us with something else that turns off the killer T's.
[00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:45.807]  And, you know, look at, look at Roger Stone's wife, took the Pfizer shot and within a month had cancer.
[00:42:47.128 --> 00:42:47.889]  In the lymphomas.
[00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.090]  In the lymph nodes, excuse me.
[00:42:50.874 --> 00:42:52.016]  So, this is it.
[00:42:52.757 --> 00:42:54.058]  And it's what was in the rat studies too.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.022]  And so, here we are.
[00:42:58.544 --> 00:43:02.209]  And you see all these executives and rich people dying from the shots too, you know.
[00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:04.872]  This is a planetary attack.
[00:43:04.912 --> 00:43:06.154]  But look at the countries that are taking it.
[00:43:07.048 --> 00:43:09.990]  United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK.
[00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.851]  Nobody else in the world is!
[00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:12.751]  Isn't it funny?
[00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:16.333]  The UN tells us Europe's bad, white people are bad, the West is bad.
[00:43:16.853 --> 00:43:26.378]  Anybody that lives here is bad because it's the idea of freedom and jurisprudence and the whole Christian ethos that the system wants to get rid of because it's bringing in globalism.
[00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:30.661]  Yeah, Kathy Griffin got her vaccine, now she's got lung cancer, which is directly associated with
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.001]  All right, we're going to come back and I'm going to get into the Millie thing.
[00:43:34.582 --> 00:43:39.024]  Greg Reese has done an excellent report at Bandot Video that's extremely powerful, dealing with this treason as well.
[00:43:39.084 --> 00:43:42.086]  I suggest you share it if you don't want to roll over and just die to these people.
[00:43:42.506 --> 00:43:43.106]  But this is it.
[00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:44.187]  This is the depopulation.
[00:43:45.688 --> 00:43:48.429]  All right, some stations don't carry this first five minutes, but a lot of them do.
[00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:49.810]  A lot of people did it on the internet, millions.
[00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.553]  So I'm going to hit the Millie stuff starting next segment, so start your engines.
[00:43:55.933 --> 00:44:00.316]  And I want to play a billionaire miner who built himself out of nothing.
[00:44:01.323 --> 00:44:03.863]  From, you know, rags to riches, but he's a patriot.
[00:44:04.844 --> 00:44:10.885]  Clive Palmer is not only a billionaire mining man, he's also a freedom fighter.
[00:44:11.605 --> 00:44:14.806]  And he's warning Australians what this power grab is really all about.
[00:44:15.566 --> 00:44:20.287]  Then I want to play Tucker Carlson, nurses refusing the vaccines because they know.
[00:44:21.547 --> 00:44:24.867]  And then Tucker Carlson on how the Dems were against the mandates.
[00:44:25.328 --> 00:44:27.348]  Then I'll be back with the big General Milley report.
[00:44:29.206 --> 00:44:30.448]  We've seen people die in hospital.
[00:44:30.488 --> 00:44:33.251]  They're not dying of a fake disease.
[00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:34.513]  They're dying of COVID-19.
[00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:48.250]  You're up here today.
[00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:49.531]  It's irresponsible.
[00:44:49.811 --> 00:44:51.492]  Well, I don't believe that, you know.
[00:44:51.673 --> 00:44:54.174]  But what would you say to those business owners that can't open their business?
[00:44:54.235 --> 00:44:55.916]  I would say it's terrible.
[00:44:55.936 --> 00:44:59.318]  Their Premier's telling them that the only way out is a double jab and that's what they've been told.
[00:44:59.338 --> 00:45:01.040]  Yeah, I'd say their Premier's lying to them.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.582]  I'd say that she's under an IPAC inquiry.
[00:45:04.282 --> 00:45:11.387]  That a particular lobbyist in Sydney controls the Liberal Party in Sydney and has told her that the only way she gets out of that inquiry is if she pushes the double jab.
[00:45:11.407 --> 00:45:15.170]  And that his clients are Aska Zeneca and his clients are FISA.
[00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.911]  That's what I'd say.
[00:45:16.371 --> 00:45:17.412]  What about the business owner?
[00:45:17.452 --> 00:45:20.394]  He can't open his doors until he's doubled down.
[00:45:20.414 --> 00:45:25.057]  You're just entering with white hat people about politics.
[00:45:25.177 --> 00:45:29.100]  This is about people that are trying to open their businesses.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.462]  People that live in poor towns that are told they have to double down.
[00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:47.792]  And that's, they know that.
[00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:52.015]  Do you think that the Premier of New South Wales wants to destroy business?
[00:45:52.115 --> 00:45:52.816]  I do.
[00:45:52.836 --> 00:45:54.357]  Why would she do that?
[00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:54.997]  It's her economy.
[00:45:55.698 --> 00:46:08.807]  Because she, as I tried to explain to you, that she's being directed by a lobbyist in Sydney, who's being paid by AstraZeneca and by Pfizer, tens of millions of dollars to get these policies through, to make sure the vaccine is pushed.
[00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:09.307]  That's why.
[00:46:09.487 --> 00:46:11.729]  You asked the question, I gave you the answer.
[00:46:11.889 --> 00:46:20.162]  And that's my personal knowledge, and I'm happy to make a statement here, to police, or to anyone, if they want to know what's going on.
[00:46:20.362 --> 00:46:20.983]  Well, that's all.
[00:46:21.103 --> 00:46:23.908]  I'll be doing that, but they'll be named.
[00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:24.389]  But not only that...
[00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:34.497]  I've got another clip of him, there's so many, where he talks about the plan is to keep you locked in your homes for small businesses to bankrupt them so the big corporations consolidate power.
[00:46:35.158 --> 00:46:40.365]  And he is trying to run TV ads, or trying to block them, he's trying to run print ads, they're not taking him.
[00:46:40.705 --> 00:46:44.330]  So now he's been reaching out to millions of Australians, spending tens of millions of his own money.
[00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:52.377]  Sending them messages about what's really behind all this and sending them to websites so they can learn how they're being taken over.
[00:46:52.498 --> 00:46:56.561]  And the government is moving to block him being able to talk to people.
[00:46:57.582 --> 00:47:01.726]  And you saw how at a press conference, one of the only men fighting back, they won't shut up.
[00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:07.410]  They won't let him talk when he has a press conference because they are bought and paid for.
[00:47:07.551 --> 00:47:10.033]  And Pfizer all over the world, as Trump said,
[00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:13.975]  ThruGates owns the medical regulators.
[00:47:14.956 --> 00:47:22.160]  In one state of Australia, one province, tens of millions of dollars to the medical boards.
[00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.682]  That's why they get up there and say, we're going to keep giving you shots forever.
[00:47:27.183 --> 00:47:40.070]  I mean, the head, the national spokesperson, the woman said yesterday, she clarified last week, she said, yeah, you're never going to end, the lockdowns are never going to end, the police, COVID rapid response deals are permanent, and you're going to take shots whenever we say.
[00:47:41.724 --> 00:47:43.985]  So, get that through your heads, folks.
[00:47:44.025 --> 00:47:44.905]  I'm talking to new listeners.
[00:47:45.405 --> 00:47:46.545]  You think you comply?
[00:47:47.385 --> 00:47:49.366]  Israel's already up to their fourth injection.
[00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.246]  Oh, you took the third?
[00:47:50.266 --> 00:47:50.866]  How about a fourth?
[00:47:50.886 --> 00:47:54.227]  And they have the highest rate of illness and death in the world.
[00:47:54.247 --> 00:47:57.148]  And I've got Australian TV admitting all this.
[00:47:58.508 --> 00:47:59.788]  And I've got so much more.
[00:47:59.828 --> 00:48:03.469]  I've got Israeli TV admitting it as well.
[00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:06.710]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back and I'm going to
[00:48:07.895 --> 00:48:15.462]  Just talk about the dire straits we're in, because if you think what's happening bad is as bad as it's going to get, you're thinking wrong.
[00:48:16.223 --> 00:48:16.864]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:16.884 --> 00:48:17.284]  Stay with us.
[00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:19.446]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:48:19.526 --> 00:48:28.175]  Welcome and thank you for joining us as we start the second hour of this live Wednesday, September 15th transmission.
[00:48:28.995 --> 00:48:30.237]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.042]  Well, it isn't about being right.
[00:48:33.102 --> 00:48:36.404]  It isn't about having news and information other people don't have.
[00:48:36.544 --> 00:48:52.854]  It's about getting it out to people so that the general public has a knowledge of what they're facing so we can all make good decisions and stop the world government corporate takeover and its endgame of deindustrialization and depopulation.
[00:48:54.497 --> 00:49:11.107]  So this is a life and death situation, and as soon as the public of the world, not just the US, figures out that the more you go along with the UN, the more you go along with the Fortune 500, the more you go along with Klaus Schwab, the more you go along with Hollywood and the liberals and the leftists and the communists and all of this,
[00:49:13.561 --> 00:49:37.554]  The more poor and pathetic and alone and desperate you're gonna be, and they think you're so stupid that as this process takes place in the next few years, we're already deep into it, you won't put two and two together that 15 days to cut the curve, to flatten the curve, becomes, man, this 15 days to flatten the curve really gets rough at 18 months, and now learning it's permanent.
[00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:43.630]  Oh, we're gonna get rid of the lockdowns.
[00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.331]  Oh, they're gonna come back in November, says Boris Johnson.
[00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:47.631]  Same thing in Canada.
[00:49:48.331 --> 00:49:55.194]  What you see around the world is what they're trying to implement here, but we have more checks and balances, but those are eroding very quickly.
[00:49:55.614 --> 00:49:57.515]  And that leads me to General Milley.
[00:49:59.156 --> 00:50:05.038]  If I try to list all the sycophantic, anti-American, white people are racist, white rage attacked the Capitol, garbage.
[00:50:06.946 --> 00:50:07.786]  It would take all day.
[00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:09.427]  We know how bad Milley is.
[00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:10.527]  And people say, well, why?
[00:50:11.327 --> 00:50:12.808]  Why was he chosen as a chairman?
[00:50:13.408 --> 00:50:16.249]  Because he was the next guy in line out of the military.
[00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:19.530]  And Trump romanticizes the military and doesn't understand.
[00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:20.770]  That's all John Wayne movies.
[00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.250]  And maybe it was true back then.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:29.632]  But nowadays, these are globalists that are sent to special think tanks and special Harvard sub-degrees.
[00:50:29.672 --> 00:50:30.773]  They get in like six months.
[00:50:31.753 --> 00:50:38.370]  When they're already colonels to show they're globalist and to show they've kissed the ring and then they're put up to the top.
[00:50:39.244 --> 00:50:50.367]  They don't recruit people to be four-star generals because they're war heroes from World War I and work 18 hours a day and do a great job, and they end up being, you know, the Supreme Commander, Allied Commander in World War II.
[00:50:51.027 --> 00:50:57.869]  Or they don't end up coming from a central Texas town, never even seen a ship, and then he does good in the Navy, so he becomes the head of the U.S.
[00:50:57.929 --> 00:50:59.369]  Navy, Admiral Nimitz.
[00:50:59.869 --> 00:51:01.590]  That was back then was on merit.
[00:51:02.648 --> 00:51:07.753]  America was about getting away from nobility, getting away from who your daddy was, and really what you stood for.
[00:51:07.973 --> 00:51:14.779]  But with Millie, it's because he is a globalist, anti-gun, anti-American bag of filth.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.561]  But let's move on from Millie.
[00:51:19.283 --> 00:51:23.507]  Millie was called and vice versa by Pelosi and by Schumer and all of them.
[00:51:23.527 --> 00:51:25.749]  They now admit they were talking the entire time.
[00:51:27.506 --> 00:51:32.428]  And they need to develop a plan to organize a coup and to go to the Secretary of Defense.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:43.487]  And to go to the Joint Chiefs and say, you swear allegiance to Milley, we're not going to follow any orders that Trump gives us to attack China.
[00:51:43.807 --> 00:51:48.370]  And they even admit, because they know there's no recordings of it or proof, he never said we're going to attack China.
[00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:55.816]  He never inferred he wanted peace with China and North Korea, got us out of Syria, which Milley secretly ignored, along with Dunford.
[00:51:56.496 --> 00:51:57.196]  Talk about traitors.
[00:51:58.557 --> 00:52:00.399]  And it expands on that.
[00:52:02.005 --> 00:52:06.308]  We also got out of Afghanistan, which they then sabotaged to make peace look like a bad thing.
[00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:09.970]  So that's how they operate.
[00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:20.957]  But we have Pelosi hiding in plain view back on January 8th of this year saying, Milley called me and said he's got control of the nukes, not Trump.
[00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.913]  And I remember them right around that time saying, don't worry.
[00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:29.659]  Milley always has another general there with him and no one's out of town.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.303]  So someone's there to always control Trump.
[00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:37.709]  This is while Milley is in there and Trump would call him in and say, did you say that?
[00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.031]  He'd say, no, sir, I didn't.
[00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:39.572]  That's a lie.
[00:52:41.055 --> 00:52:44.856]  Lying to the President as the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman is treason, is a felony.
[00:52:45.617 --> 00:52:49.738]  Just like the Secretary of State lied to play this coming up in Congress yesterday.
[00:52:50.098 --> 00:52:52.179]  They said, hey, they keep cutting the mic off of Biden.
[00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:53.439]  We've got like 20 clips of it.
[00:52:54.079 --> 00:52:55.400]  He goes, no, sir, we never done that.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.160]  He's a really bad liar.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.882]  No, it was like a weasel just caught with a hen in its mouth.
[00:53:01.142 --> 00:53:03.963]  The hen house, no, we don't control him.
[00:53:04.363 --> 00:53:05.543]  We never cut his mic.
[00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.925]  And so it's that same level of lying.
[00:53:10.905 --> 00:53:19.671]  And it's all a bunch of backstabbing bureaucrats and social climbers and garbage that are run by lobbyists and big banks that are buying and selling and controlling the planet.
[00:53:19.931 --> 00:53:23.014]  But even the trillion dollar companies, even the bankers don't run anything.
[00:53:24.775 --> 00:53:26.916]  They control their minions who all backstab each other.
[00:53:27.157 --> 00:53:29.118]  And so they wanted to make sure Trump didn't run anything.
[00:53:29.598 --> 00:53:38.465]  But in the process, it's a giant committee of hundreds of people that make the decisions within thousands of little scheming bureaucrats like Milley
[00:53:40.319 --> 00:53:49.465]  Who then, to undermine the president, made up a story to Congress and back and forth that he might use nukes to do that in case they had to take him out.
[00:53:50.405 --> 00:53:53.227]  Or in case he didn't leave office, or in case he challenged the election.
[00:53:54.007 --> 00:53:58.190]  And Milley also told the Chinese general and Pelosi, you've got the transcripts right here, which they confirm are real.
[00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:09.317]  Because they're proud of it, they're hiding it in plain view, that he told the Chinese and he told Pelosi and Schumer, Trump tried to overthrow our government.
[00:54:11.707 --> 00:54:12.988]  And he might try it again.
[00:54:13.068 --> 00:54:14.828]  Trump wasn't part of that Capitol thing.
[00:54:14.889 --> 00:54:15.389]  I was there.
[00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:16.229]  We all got set up.
[00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:17.450]  A million people came to hear him speak.
[00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.291]  He was lied to and told there was a stage set up and all this garbage.
[00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:20.891]  We didn't check.
[00:54:21.252 --> 00:54:25.534]  We get down there, and it's all a setup, and they had provocateurs ready to invade the Capitol.
[00:54:25.734 --> 00:54:30.536]  The police open the doors, have the provocateurs get them open and wave everybody in because they were ordered to.
[00:54:30.816 --> 00:54:32.197]  Not blaming the police, they were ordered to.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:33.477]  That's compartmentalization.
[00:54:33.877 --> 00:54:50.464]  So they ran that whole thing, they bragged in Time Magazine months after how they had the coup against Trump and how all these forces worked together in media and Republicans and Democrats and top generals and top PR firms with lawyers and how this top professor orchestrated the whole thing and is the greatest conductor ever.
[00:54:51.224 --> 00:54:52.045]  They're bragging!
[00:54:53.427 --> 00:54:58.291]  So I have the articles with Pelosi saying, don't worry, they never let him alone.
[00:54:58.571 --> 00:55:00.393]  Don't worry, the nukes are safe.
[00:55:00.413 --> 00:55:01.473]  Got them right here, here's one right here.
[00:55:02.574 --> 00:55:03.255]  January 8th.
[00:55:04.536 --> 00:55:20.949]  And then we've got the open letter that Trump was never given, because they weren't in writing, where he told the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all their adjunct officers, you will pledge allegiance to me, and you will only take orders from me for military action, not President Trump.
[00:55:24.465 --> 00:55:24.966]  You heard that?
[00:55:26.528 --> 00:55:27.088]  Got it right here.
[00:55:27.369 --> 00:55:29.271]  Then he added, only if it's written.
[00:55:29.632 --> 00:55:32.255]  But he knows Trump's dictating and they throw that in the trash.
[00:55:32.736 --> 00:55:36.401]  Just like all those executive orders to stop the globalist and criminal activities.
[00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:38.904]  So there's your coup, but notice the inversion.
[00:55:39.184 --> 00:55:40.306]  Trump was involved in the coup.
[00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:43.431]  Trump was going to cause a nuclear war.
[00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:44.833]  Trump was going to attack China.
[00:55:44.853 --> 00:55:47.756]  Trump was going to attack... Trump was going to get us out of these wars.
[00:55:48.056 --> 00:55:49.698]  Trump was going to bring our troops home and do it properly.
[00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:54.845]  Trump was trying to make deals to, hey, build condos and resorts in North Korea, empower your people, be like South Korea.
[00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:57.167]  What a sales job, with a whole produced...
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.941]  C.G.
[00:55:59.101 --> 00:56:04.886]  knew North Korea and had Kim Jong-un sold, but then they undermined it and screwed the whole deal up.
[00:56:05.486 --> 00:56:07.348]  And China doesn't want North Korea to be prosperous.
[00:56:07.428 --> 00:56:12.292]  So these people want us poor and pathetic and falling apart and starving in the dark alone.
[00:56:12.913 --> 00:56:20.619]  Then you had Pelosi out surveying the troops in front of the Capitol and nodding at them and having all wear their masks while they fed them dog food and made them sleep on
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.522]  The garage floor and the big fence up around, you know, the insurrection, the worst attack in U.S.
[00:56:26.562 --> 00:56:26.903]  history.
[00:56:27.203 --> 00:56:29.544]  And then, worse than 9-11, worse than Pearl Harbor.
[00:56:29.764 --> 00:56:39.929]  And then Milley goes up with that other anti-American gun-grabbing crook, Austin, and says, wait a minute, I want to know about why white people attacked.
[00:56:40.329 --> 00:56:41.810]  I want to know why it was a racial attack.
[00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:48.873]  You just made it a racial attack, people protesting, a million people and 600 being waived by the police, maybe 20, 30, 40 attacked the cops.
[00:56:51.704 --> 00:56:57.608]  The total script of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, the Democratic Party, all of the American people are terrorists.
[00:56:58.048 --> 00:56:59.209]  That the American people are the enemy.
[00:56:59.229 --> 00:57:00.309]  They're about to blow everything up.
[00:57:00.529 --> 00:57:07.994]  The new national security directive of June that Biden signed saying the main threat is China or Russia or Al Qaeda or the Taliban.
[00:57:08.094 --> 00:57:09.075]  It's the American people.
[00:57:09.275 --> 00:57:13.457]  And now you hear that talking point from Michael Moore and Chuck Schumer and the
[00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:26.230]  Sunday talk shows and the nightly comedy shows that you know we need the troops back out of Afghanistan for the American people, for these right-wingers, for those that question lockdowns and deny them medical care while you're at it.
[00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:29.423]  And they're signing on UN treaties to take the guns?
[00:57:29.803 --> 00:57:34.106]  This is the takeover by a UN multinational corporate takeover.
[00:57:34.387 --> 00:57:44.314]  And they'll sit back in Europe in their palaces and their castles while we all kill each other and while they give us deadly shots and they depopulate the old people they don't want to pay their pension funds.
[00:57:44.895 --> 00:57:46.616]  I mean, this is 21st century war.
[00:57:46.876 --> 00:57:48.397]  They'll come back and explain the real treason.
[00:57:48.417 --> 00:57:48.818]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.949 --> 00:57:53.673]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a globalist Frankenstein we got to deal with now.
[00:57:53.693 --> 00:58:02.142]  The monster is out of control, doing whatever it wants, wherever it wants, injecting us with frankenshots that are killing people and maiming them en masse.
[00:58:02.162 --> 00:58:03.884]  So let me lay the heavy information on you.
[00:58:04.504 --> 00:58:11.432]  General Milley, that looks like a little stunted overweight Frankenstein, and acts like an absolute globalist traitor,
[00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:21.834]  Engaged in treason when he called the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the CHICOMS that runs giant death camps everywhere and says they want to destroy the U.S.
[00:58:21.914 --> 00:58:22.255]  and our
[00:58:23.171 --> 00:58:30.595]  Have bought off half our politicians and said, Trump tried to overthrow things, but I'm in control and we're going to stop him from attacking you.
[00:58:30.615 --> 00:58:32.616]  And the general freaked out and said, should I launch an attack?
[00:58:32.656 --> 00:58:33.376]  Well, oh my God.
[00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:45.042]  And the Chinese all went crazy and almost attacked us because this guy wanted to ingratiate himself with the chi-coms because he'd been told to do this by Schumer and Pelosi and the globalists.
[00:58:45.102 --> 00:58:46.883]  And he knew those were going to be his new bosses.
[00:58:47.243 --> 00:58:48.563]  And he wanted to follow those orders.
[00:58:48.583 --> 00:58:49.464]  We have the transcripts.
[00:58:51.564 --> 00:58:52.465]  And they admit the news.
[00:58:52.685 --> 00:59:00.771]  Oh, thank God he called all the Joint Chiefs and their adjuncts and said, you will pledge allegiance to me and you will not follow Trump's orders.
[00:59:02.092 --> 00:59:03.433]  He told Pelosi that as well.
[00:59:03.693 --> 00:59:08.816]  Pelosi says she spoke to General Milley about Trump and the nuclear codes and said the military won't let him do it.
[00:59:10.858 --> 00:59:12.739]  Oh my gosh, go arrest Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.819 --> 00:59:14.821]  You know, he might barbecue his children tonight.
[00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:16.762]  But was I planning to barbecue my children?
[00:59:16.782 --> 00:59:17.383]  Did I say that?
[00:59:17.443 --> 00:59:17.583]  No.
[00:59:19.329 --> 00:59:21.229]  Trump was doing the opposite, pulling us out of these wars.
[00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:23.450]  Lying, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:26.691]  He was using economic power to stand up to the chi-comps.
[00:59:29.411 --> 00:59:30.371]  So think about that.
[00:59:31.912 --> 00:59:33.472]  But the bigger picture isn't Milley.
[00:59:34.232 --> 00:59:38.913]  You've got Senator Paul saying it's treason, he must be removed, plus a terrible job in Afghanistan.
[00:59:39.373 --> 00:59:40.194]  All was done by design.
[00:59:40.774 --> 00:59:41.594]  To make peace look bad.
[00:59:43.172 --> 00:59:53.377]  And you've got Trump saying, well, if it's true, we'll play that clip next segment, if it's true he did this, no, it's all admitted, Mr. President, then he should be fired for treason.
[00:59:53.397 --> 00:59:57.119]  Well, you don't get fired for treason, you get put in prison.
[00:59:57.699 --> 01:00:00.760]  And if it's real treason, you know what the books say.
[01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:04.722]  But let me, let me show you something.
[01:00:04.762 --> 01:00:05.963]  This is 10 U.S.
[01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:10.085]  Code 152 Chairman Appointment Grade and Rank.
[01:00:10.965 --> 01:00:12.006]  And it says in Section
[01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:18.313]  C. See grade and rank.
[01:00:19.473 --> 01:00:21.954]  The chairman, while serving, holds the grade of general.
[01:00:22.894 --> 01:00:28.056]  In the case of the Navy Admiral or in the case of the officer of the Space Force, equivalent grade.
[01:00:28.336 --> 01:00:33.978]  All outranks all other offices of the Armed Forces.
[01:00:34.018 --> 01:00:41.600]  However, he may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the Armed Forces.
[01:00:43.052 --> 01:00:48.214]  He has no command over armed forces because he might try to become a dictator.
[01:00:50.034 --> 01:00:51.795]  Like you saw with them killing Caesar.
[01:00:53.696 --> 01:00:55.016]  Setting up their own system again.
[01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:56.256]  And here it is.
[01:00:57.437 --> 01:00:58.757]  But that's just the law.
[01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:00.898]  Who needs that?
[01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:05.259]  I mean, Biden just signed an order saying everybody's bank account's down to $600.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.780]  Every transaction's watched.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.000]  No Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.181]  Just screw your country.
[01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:17.414]  And we're going to say it's an authorized vaccine, and when it's not even a vaccine, and it's not been tested, but we secretly tested it, it's why we're not going to test it.
[01:01:17.434 --> 01:01:20.897]  You know, they're sitting around years ago, our Operation Lockstep's got a problem.
[01:01:22.698 --> 01:01:25.700]  We try to roll this out, it's going to kill the animals and kill humans in human trials.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.041]  We just don't do the trials.
[01:01:27.402 --> 01:01:28.562]  Well, you know how deadly it is?
[01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:31.765]  We'll do those in secret or under other vaccine program names, which they did.
[01:01:35.452 --> 01:01:39.775]  You know, you wonder why the Communists would want to take over Russia and kill 30, 40 million of their own people.
[01:01:40.036 --> 01:01:41.877]  Because they wanted to kill people.
[01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:42.818]  They wanted power and control.
[01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:43.719]  Lenin said that.
[01:01:43.759 --> 01:01:44.479]  It's called the Red Terror.
[01:01:44.719 --> 01:01:46.661]  You wonder why Hitler would start a war with Russia?
[01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:50.124]  You know, it didn't end too well for Napoleon and others.
[01:01:50.204 --> 01:01:50.944]  Why would you do that?
[01:01:51.004 --> 01:01:53.226]  The biggest landmass in the world and a bunch of tough people.
[01:01:54.167 --> 01:01:54.907]  More of them than you.
[01:01:54.988 --> 01:01:55.948]  Twice as many Russians.
[01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:58.470]  That's not a very smart fight to start.
[01:01:58.911 --> 01:02:00.652]  Because he wanted to kill people!
[01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:01.973]  He wanted blood!
[01:02:02.013 --> 01:02:02.774]  He wanted death!
[01:02:04.465 --> 01:02:06.406]  The journey was the destination.
[01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:08.867]  And we just keep wondering what's going on with these people.
[01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:10.828]  They're psychotic killers.
[01:02:11.588 --> 01:02:17.471]  Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Klaus Schwab all write about how they want to depopulate 90% of people and they're doing it!
[01:02:17.971 --> 01:02:20.532]  They told you they would and they're doing it!
[01:02:21.412 --> 01:02:23.373]  And they've groomed monsters.
[01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:25.714]  Like Millie.
[01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:27.595]  So here is the reason they want us off air.
[01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:33.379]  Because nine times out of ten, we're the only ones that figure out the big picture, because we do the most studying.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.465]  Jack Posobiec was high-level naval intelligence, very jacked in, a great guy.
[01:02:38.427 --> 01:02:40.829]  He came out and he's saying all the same stuff, because it's not his opinion.
[01:02:40.869 --> 01:02:41.709]  It's right here in CNN.
[01:02:41.749 --> 01:02:43.210]  It's right here in NBC News.
[01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:48.554]  From the time, the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, the 9th, the 10th, the 12th, they're all in the news going, don't worry, we have control of the military.
[01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:49.594]  We had control.
[01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.276]  They throw away his executive orders.
[01:02:51.296 --> 01:02:52.176]  They don't listen to him.
[01:02:52.456 --> 01:02:54.218]  You know, if he tries to nuke stuff, we'll stop him.
[01:02:54.538 --> 01:03:06.666]  And now Bob Woodward puts a book out thinking it's going to make Trump look bad, because maybe in America is so stupid, they think like having someone call the Chinese and lie to him and say, because he knows the Chinese are spying on us.
[01:03:07.146 --> 01:03:08.067]  He knows the Chinese.
[01:03:09.448 --> 01:03:11.690]  Let me give you inside baseball, okay, if you understand how things work.
[01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:18.074]  You know why Milley got told by Schumer and Obama, you know, he talked to him and the rest of them?
[01:03:18.575 --> 01:03:19.315]  Pelosi to call.
[01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:24.479]  Because the Chinese have got about 80% of Democrat people in their pockets.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.000]  They're really double agents.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.302]  They're screwing each other on both sides, the Dems and them.
[01:03:28.482 --> 01:03:31.765]  The Dems are globalist agents, but they are on the Chi-Com payroll.
[01:03:34.784 --> 01:03:39.528]  They knew, Milley knew the Chinese were getting chatter that Trump was planning to nuke China.
[01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:44.491]  Not because Trump ever said that or did that, and the military has confirmed it and Trump's confirmed it, we know that.
[01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:50.916]  And it fits into what he was doing, trying to have, you know, success through economics and through deals, not through war.
[01:03:51.957 --> 01:03:59.542]  Because they were going around telling members of Congress and the media and their staff, all of which have Chinese agents on them.
[01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.445]  Check it out, literally.
[01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:03.225]  It's come out in the news.
[01:04:03.285 --> 01:04:04.106]  Feinstein, all of them.
[01:04:05.745 --> 01:04:16.930]  And they told him, we may have to have a coup, we may have to kill Trump, we may have to remove him, we may have to do this, because you saw on the news, oh don't worry, the deep state's gonna kill this guy, or the intelligence agencies have seven ways this Sunday to take him out.
[01:04:18.591 --> 01:04:23.193]  They had it all ready, but they needed a cover, and it was gonna be that he went crazy and ordered a nuclear attack?
[01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:26.827]  And had the football in his hand, and General Milley had to kill him.
[01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:34.694]  I'm telling you, these people would script something like that, and Milley would be this hero, and oh, da-dun, da-dun, and that's what they were planning.
[01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:35.975]  That's how bad they are.
[01:04:36.015 --> 01:04:39.599]  They're not going to stab the President like Julius Caesar, U2, Brutus.
[01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:49.007]  They're going to screw him over by setting him up and telling his enemies, who might have even attacked
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.761]  It started a war.
[01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:52.904]  A lot of the globalists want to go ahead and have a war with China.
[01:04:53.064 --> 01:04:55.007]  They've been trying to entice a war for decades.
[01:04:55.047 --> 01:04:56.229]  Joel Scalzman's exposed that.
[01:04:58.992 --> 01:05:02.537]  So it doesn't matter if it's Pelosi or Swallow's Well or her nephew or whatever the hell he is.
[01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:05.316]  It's all the same thing.
[01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:07.197]  It's all the same sick crew.
[01:05:08.058 --> 01:05:09.158]  She's related to Newsom.
[01:05:09.199 --> 01:05:19.446]  It's all one sick crew of double-dealing, backstabbing scum that fear the American people ever waking up, that fear the American people ever getting control of the government and bringing them to justice.
[01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:20.807]  So we're their natural enemy.
[01:05:22.861 --> 01:05:24.082]  And so it isn't about Milley.
[01:05:24.242 --> 01:05:25.183]  Sure, he needs to go to prison.
[01:05:25.624 --> 01:05:26.845]  It's about Pelosi.
[01:05:27.145 --> 01:05:27.986]  It's about Schumer.
[01:05:28.026 --> 01:05:28.807]  It's about the Clintons.
[01:05:28.847 --> 01:05:29.608]  It's about Obama.
[01:05:29.848 --> 01:05:32.691]  It's about the deep state coup that's in place already.
[01:05:33.051 --> 01:05:38.116]  Trump was just there interrupting that and had a chance as a beachhead to take the island of D.C.
[01:05:38.136 --> 01:05:45.523]  back from the globalists, but he didn't do it because we didn't back him and Q told us he was invincible, so people sat there with their thumbs up their rears.
[01:05:46.357 --> 01:05:46.957]  And that's what happened.
[01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:48.038]  And now you know.
[01:05:48.818 --> 01:06:00.443]  And now you know there's a military coup, a globalist coup over our country, and now they're killing us with chemical weapons, and moving to bankrupt us, and put in total AI control, and finish the job they started, declaring all America's terrorists.
[01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:06.326]  I want to be completely clear with our amazing listeners all across the United States and all across this amazing planet.
[01:06:07.887 --> 01:06:12.589]  I don't come up here and say these terrible things to scare you, or to shock you, or
[01:06:14.025 --> 01:06:16.086]  To try to make you give up.
[01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.167]  I believe you're like me.
[01:06:17.287 --> 01:06:24.790]  I believe when faced with these real attacks, I believe when you're faced with this great evil, you're going to stop submitting to the system.
[01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:26.191]  You're going to build your own system.
[01:06:26.211 --> 01:06:28.192]  You're going to find others that think the way you do.
[01:06:28.812 --> 01:06:34.315]  And we're going to do like our ancestors did over and over again, build a remnant or redoubts against this.
[01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.711]  But we're going to have to come out of the system.
[01:06:36.771 --> 01:06:37.911]  Forget going to their concerts.
[01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:38.872]  Forget going to their movies.
[01:06:39.192 --> 01:06:40.312]  It's already collapsing anyways.
[01:06:40.392 --> 01:06:48.136]  It's all a manipulation to make you take their mark, take their injection, take over your body, destroy your immune system, and slowly kill you.
[01:06:49.197 --> 01:06:50.757]  Predators are making their move.
[01:06:51.057 --> 01:06:54.659]  First they dumbed us down, then they made us weak, now they're coming after us.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.062]  And they put people in, like the Secretary of State who lies.
[01:07:00.162 --> 01:07:02.523]  I mean, this morning, I went and reviewed
[01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:11.925]  Five or six clips, we'll play it next segment, of Biden having his mic turned off and them saying, all right, we're gonna turn the mic off, all right, they turn it off.
[01:07:12.645 --> 01:07:15.288]  And now when he says something embarrassing, they turn it off, they cut the feed.
[01:07:15.608 --> 01:07:18.130]  They've admitted they do it before, Biden's admitted it before.
[01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:24.136]  And then there's the Secretary of State lying to a US Senator saying that's ridiculous, we don't do it.
[01:07:26.298 --> 01:07:28.640]  And it's just like the Democrats all at 9-11 this weekend,
[01:07:30.219 --> 01:07:34.621]  They're back in the parking lot area, about to be let in, in the private parking lot area.
[01:07:34.861 --> 01:07:35.781]  None of them are wearing masks.
[01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:36.401]  They're all laughing.
[01:07:36.422 --> 01:07:37.102]  They're all joking.
[01:07:37.522 --> 01:07:40.343]  Then they put their mask on and go through the back onto the stage.
[01:07:41.143 --> 01:07:42.004]  It's theater!
[01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:49.827]  And just like suspended disbelief, when you're younger, you can go to a movie, you see it, and five minutes in, I would be in a trance.
[01:07:50.247 --> 01:07:52.108]  It would be so real and so incredible.
[01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:59.831]  But once I got to be a video editor and a writer and a researcher by my 20s, I can't go into suspended disbelief ever.
[01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:05.904]  I look at the camera angles, I look at the lighting, I think about who wrote it, I'm interested in the credits.
[01:08:06.745 --> 01:08:10.891]  The films are still fascinating, but it's from a perspective of a social engineer.
[01:08:11.332 --> 01:08:13.214]  I'm not using social engineer techniques.
[01:08:13.695 --> 01:08:15.157]  I know what's going on.
[01:08:15.417 --> 01:08:17.360]  And you talk to a leftist particularly,
[01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:31.122]  They're five to six times more likely to be mentally ill, six to nine times more likely to steal, six to eight times more likely to virtue signal but not give to charity, in their own statistics, their own universities do studies, and that to them is good.
[01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:33.583]  They also have arrested development.
[01:08:33.603 --> 01:08:40.626]  That's why they give all over the world college students that are upset Play-Doh and little foot-tall tables where they get sit down with coloring books.
[01:08:42.566 --> 01:08:46.708]  And they're rewarded by the professors and others with high grades for sucking their thumbs.
[01:08:51.872 --> 01:08:54.214]  These are people living in a delusion.
[01:08:56.015 --> 01:09:00.479]  And then you've got their controllers, who are lying to us by design.
[01:09:00.539 --> 01:09:04.322]  So, here it is, 10 U.S.
[01:09:04.382 --> 01:09:06.363]  Code 152 Chairman Appointment.
[01:09:07.064 --> 01:09:08.485]  He may not command U.S.
[01:09:08.525 --> 01:09:17.231]  forces, he may not exercise military command over anyone, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or any armed forces.
[01:09:17.832 --> 01:09:20.114]  Because you don't want the Chairman, the Advisor to the President,
[01:09:20.953 --> 01:09:22.014]  To think he's the president.
[01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:26.616]  Well, that old thing that's happened in history thousands of times.
[01:09:26.876 --> 01:09:28.857]  You know about hundreds of famous cases, don't you?
[01:09:29.797 --> 01:09:30.978]  It just happened again.
[01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:31.758]  And you know what?
[01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:35.920]  They removed the president, they stole the election, and they're in charge now.
[01:09:36.221 --> 01:09:37.401]  And did they reconcile?
[01:09:37.641 --> 01:09:39.442]  Did they say, let's be friendly, let's come together?
[01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:40.823]  Their puppet Biden did.
[01:09:42.185 --> 01:09:45.706]  Like in Saving Private Ryan, where the German soldier says, oh, let's be friends.
[01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:48.047]  And as soon as he pulls the dagger away, the German stabs him.
[01:09:48.367 --> 01:09:48.968]  It's the same thing.
[01:09:49.348 --> 01:09:50.828]  Oh, Biden, let's all be friends.
[01:09:50.848 --> 01:09:51.408]  Let's come together.
[01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:54.149]  Meanwhile, all the surrogates, the gun owners are terrorists.
[01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.610]  Those that question the election are terrorists.
[01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:57.211]  Those that don't law lockdown are terrorists.
[01:09:57.231 --> 01:09:57.971]  They're the main threat.
[01:09:58.311 --> 01:10:00.252]  They're secretly working with the Taliban.
[01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:01.972]  They're going to, well, it's them working with the Taliban.
[01:10:02.152 --> 01:10:03.333]  They're going to kill everybody.
[01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:05.314]  We've got to go to war with the American people.
[01:10:06.834 --> 01:10:08.795]  That's the new national threat assessment from June.
[01:10:10.148 --> 01:10:14.510]  The first week of the press conference, it was, we're going to have the CIA and FBI go after the American people.
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.250]  They're the terrorists.
[01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:18.552]  I said, oh, they're going to put it in the National Threat Directive.
[01:10:18.572 --> 01:10:19.732]  They're going to make it the main threat.
[01:10:19.832 --> 01:10:20.693]  And they did it.
[01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:25.735]  Because they're a foreign group of criminals, not Chinese agents.
[01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:29.137]  Oh, they take money from that.
[01:10:29.177 --> 01:10:32.218]  They're like a whore that'll take money from whoever gives it to them.
[01:10:32.258 --> 01:10:33.099]  Really, they're like a pimp.
[01:10:33.159 --> 01:10:35.139]  I guess they whore us out, then they take the money.
[01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:37.901]  And
[01:10:39.449 --> 01:10:42.010]  All they care about is their power and their control.
[01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.571]  So they come to them, the big banks come to them, and they go, well, the U.S.
[01:10:45.591 --> 01:10:47.211]  has one of the oldest populations in the world.
[01:10:48.932 --> 01:10:52.993]  Let's give them a shot that gives them Alzheimer's, neurological disorder, and it'll shorten their life by 10 years.
[01:10:53.674 --> 01:10:56.494]  If they take it when they're, say, 60, that way you don't have to pay out the retirement.
[01:10:57.315 --> 01:10:58.895]  As if all that fiat means anything.
[01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:00.836]  They go, absolutely, we've got a
[01:11:01.687 --> 01:11:08.190]  There's too many people and the planet's reached its carrying capacity, and the world as we know it has to end by 2030 if we're going to save the planet.
[01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:11.772]  That's the official UN Biological Diversity Assessment.
[01:11:11.812 --> 01:11:23.719]  That's what Beto O'Rourke and AOC have all been briefed on, so they kind of come out in their own way, just little morons that are front people, and say, oh, the world ends in 12 years.
[01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:24.539]  That was two years ago.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.601]  2030, we've got to just cut resources.
[01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:33.021]  And it's all just this vague cosmology they follow.
[01:11:35.265 --> 01:11:44.030]  Because the average person going along with this at a level of management, even if it's low or high, they just want an excuse to believe being greedy and hateful is good.
[01:11:44.230 --> 01:12:01.440]  Like the photos that I saw, noticed of her wearing the designer dress, tens of thousands of dollars, and the expensive jewelry, and the expensive everything, saying being wealthy is bad, no, being corrupt and wealthy is bad, stealing and becoming wealthy is bad, being a globalist and being wealthy is bad, shutting down all your competition and becoming filthy rich is bad.
[01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:07.973]  But it was photos of her and others in their gowns with all the servants wearing masks, but they don't.
[01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.154]  It's a total class thing.
[01:12:10.975 --> 01:12:12.776]  It's a sign of being in the slave class.
[01:12:19.159 --> 01:12:25.023]  Let's play a clip of Trump saying, if it's true, because he's smart not to believe Bob Woodward.
[01:12:25.283 --> 01:12:28.665]  Well, it's funny, if he had real advisors, Trump would know it's true.
[01:12:28.825 --> 01:12:30.606]  They bragged about it back on January 8th.
[01:12:32.608 --> 01:12:37.335]  How they'd already taken the military way before they ever stole the election from him to make sure they could steal it.
[01:12:37.355 --> 01:12:46.267]  They had the media, they had big tech, they had the censorship, they even took his Twitter away, and then they blame him for what would have a nuclear war when they were the ones almost starting it, calling up and lying about it.
[01:12:46.288 --> 01:12:47.049]  Here's President Trump.
[01:12:47.677 --> 01:13:02.156]  So first of all, if it is actually true, which is hard to believe, that he would have called China and done these things and was willing to advise them of an attack or in advance of an attack, that's treason!
[01:13:02.917 --> 01:13:07.520]  And I would think, I've had so many calls today saying, that's treason, number one.
[01:13:07.581 --> 01:13:09.662]  Number two, it's totally ridiculous.
[01:13:09.722 --> 01:13:10.543]  I never thought of it.
[01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:11.123]  You were there.
[01:13:11.183 --> 01:13:13.745]  You knew what was happening in the White House.
[01:13:13.785 --> 01:13:14.686]  You have plenty of friends.
[01:13:15.126 --> 01:13:18.668]  You never heard the word China mentioned in a thing like this.
[01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:23.032]  You heard a lot of anger about China on trade, and we made a great trade deal.
[01:13:23.092 --> 01:13:25.974]  You heard a lot of anger on China with the China virus.
[01:13:26.594 --> 01:13:39.564]  But for him to say that I would even think about attacking China, I think he's trying to just get out of his incompetent withdrawal out of Afghanistan.
[01:13:39.924 --> 01:13:49.131]  The worst, the dumbest thing that anybody's seen, probably the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to our country, where they killed our soldiers.
[01:13:51.212 --> 01:13:54.914]  See, see, Trump goes to like, this guy's an opportunist, he just made this up in a book.
[01:13:55.074 --> 01:13:55.454]  Uh, no.
[01:13:55.894 --> 01:14:04.498]  They were prepared to kill you, they were prepared to remove you, they bragged about it with Pelosi, with Schumer, they set it all up and had the military secretly pledge allegiance to Milley.
[01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:07.500]  That's illegal, Trump, and your advisors won't tell you that.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.482]  They'll go, yeah, he's in so much trouble, sir, over Afghanistan, they just did this to change the subject.
[01:14:12.802 --> 01:14:18.605]  No, they did this to rub it in on you and say you tried to have a nuclear war when you were trying to bring peace.
[01:14:20.273 --> 01:14:22.535]  And they're pissed about Afghanistan, so they wreck that deal.
[01:14:22.935 --> 01:14:25.197]  That's what they did, and Trump has all the ammo.
[01:14:26.098 --> 01:14:28.460]  But Trump has good instincts, but he doesn't do the research.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.424]  He knows about golf and his lobster tails and his steak, and that he likes America.
[01:14:33.744 --> 01:14:35.786]  He doesn't like people screwing us over in business deals.
[01:14:36.166 --> 01:14:40.690]  But it's bigger than just, he thought the elite would want to make more money and be more powerful, have America on top.
[01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:42.111]  Why are you having China on top?
[01:14:42.151 --> 01:14:42.911]  We should be on top.
[01:14:43.272 --> 01:14:47.075]  They go, yes sir, you're right, while they stab him in the back, because it's a spiritual thing.
[01:14:48.174 --> 01:14:49.635]  At the end of the day, they do bad.
[01:14:49.715 --> 01:14:50.556]  They hate America.
[01:14:50.596 --> 01:14:51.337]  They want to defeat it.
[01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:52.497]  They want to suck it dry.
[01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:53.318]  They want to destroy it.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.583]  Pelosi threatens the president, one way or another, we will remove Trump.
[01:14:59.643 --> 01:15:01.384]  She said the military will drag him out.
[01:15:01.825 --> 01:15:05.728]  That was in October, before November.
[01:15:05.948 --> 01:15:07.309]  They had it all set up.
[01:15:07.329 --> 01:15:07.970]  But as usual,
[01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:10.717]  Is Rand Paul getting it?
[01:15:11.057 --> 01:15:11.818]  Is Trump getting it?
[01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:15.921]  Is all the other... Chuck Carlson gets a lot of it.
[01:15:15.981 --> 01:15:17.042]  He's about the best there is.
[01:15:17.583 --> 01:15:20.565]  We just sit here, not getting it, not knowing what really happened.
[01:15:20.905 --> 01:15:22.166]  The coup won!
[01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:23.487]  The coup is in place!
[01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:24.769]  It's globalist run!
[01:15:25.009 --> 01:15:25.829]  It's illegitimate!
[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:26.870]  It's poisoning us!
[01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:28.652]  It's setting up a world ID card!
[01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:32.795]  We need governors and state legislatures and senators to stand up and defeat it!
[01:15:32.955 --> 01:15:34.537]  And America would rally behind that!
[01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:35.926]  That's right.
[01:15:36.026 --> 01:15:37.147]  Evil comes and evil goes.
[01:15:37.187 --> 01:15:39.729]  But love your children, love your wives, your husbands, your family.
[01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:41.210]  Take care of each other.
[01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:44.132]  And don't let them put this deadly injection.
[01:15:44.152 --> 01:15:47.935]  You see, they want to get everybody injected so everybody gets sick and they can claim it's another virus later.
[01:15:47.955 --> 01:15:55.480]  But if you have a control group of hundreds of millions of people that's not injected, that isn't sick, and they didn't have the heart attacks and the cancers, you've got a big problem.
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.862]  And they've really committed to a criminal takeover.
[01:15:58.882 --> 01:16:02.665]  And imagine what they've got up their sleeve next if they've already done something this bold.
[01:16:02.745 --> 01:16:04.006]  So, here's the bottom line.
[01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:09.609]  Joe Biden is a complete puppet.
[01:16:09.769 --> 01:16:11.331]  They knew they were planning to steal the election.
[01:16:11.351 --> 01:16:12.672]  They wanted a puppet they could control.
[01:16:12.692 --> 01:16:15.954]  They want this international bureaucracy in the UN to be in charge.
[01:16:15.974 --> 01:16:17.755]  They want to discredit America in the process.
[01:16:18.136 --> 01:16:21.839]  They want an embarrassing weak president in there to undermine the office further.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:35.069]  And they are now making their move against our republic and mopping up the final governors and senators and House members and legislators and other leaders that oppose them.
[01:16:35.953 --> 01:16:41.018]  And they are in an operation of trying to put governors and legislators and talk show hosts and everybody else in prison.
[01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:43.160]  Trying to bankrupt us, trying to sue us.
[01:16:43.761 --> 01:16:49.427]  They sue you in jurisdictions where they own the judges, where they don't even want to try to make a deal with you to get money in these suits.
[01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:52.550]  They tell you, no, we just want to get in and shut your company down.
[01:16:53.131 --> 01:16:55.974]  Which with the right judges, they can just do bypass and come in and do it.
[01:16:57.858 --> 01:16:57.978]  Yes.
[01:17:17.708 --> 01:17:29.916]  Through the judiciary and the legislatures and every other level of the people they control and Soros buying off the prosecutors and installing the prosecutors to finish their takeover of this country.
[01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:33.519]  And so it's a very, very dangerous moment.
[01:17:33.639 --> 01:17:45.807]  You know, I was reminded when I saw a clip last night of Senator questioning Biden and asking him about
[01:17:47.492 --> 01:17:54.414]  Or questioning Biden's Secretary of State and saying, you know, who's in control?
[01:17:54.494 --> 01:17:55.534]  Who is in charge?
[01:17:56.095 --> 01:17:58.135]  Because Biden obviously doesn't know who he is at the time.
[01:17:58.575 --> 01:18:01.276]  Video, Senator demands to know who cuts off Biden's mic.
[01:18:01.696 --> 01:18:03.317]  We need to know who is in charge.
[01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:06.998]  This is a puppeteer act, said Senator Reich.
[01:18:07.978 --> 01:18:14.140]  And the Secretary of State looks right at him in the most bald-faced way I've ever seen.
[01:18:16.138 --> 01:18:17.519]  And, well, just see it for yourself.
[01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:17.859]  Here it is.
[01:18:17.879 --> 01:18:19.881]  We've all seen this.
[01:18:19.901 --> 01:18:22.243]  We saw it as recently as yesterday.
[01:18:22.843 --> 01:18:30.349]  Somebody in the White House has authority to press the button and stop the President, cut off the President's speaking ability and sound.
[01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:31.630]  Who is that person?
[01:18:32.611 --> 01:18:41.998]  I think anyone who knows the President, including members of this committee, knows that he speaks very clearly and very deliberately for himself.
[01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:43.659]  No one else does.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.721]  Are you saying that there's no one in the White House that can cut him off?
[01:18:48.801 --> 01:18:51.981]  Because yesterday that happened and it's happened a number of times before that.
[01:18:52.321 --> 01:18:59.103]  It's been widely reported that somebody has the ability to push the button and cut off his sound and stop him from speaking.
[01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:01.643]  Who is that person?
[01:19:02.544 --> 01:19:03.484]  There is no such person.
[01:19:03.524 --> 01:19:14.746]  Again, the President speaks for himself, makes all of the strategic decisions, informed by the best advice that he can get from the people around him.
[01:19:15.026 --> 01:19:17.727]  So are you unaware that this is actually happening?
[01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:22.127]  Because it happened yesterday at the Interagency Fire Center.
[01:19:23.128 --> 01:19:28.869]  It was widely reported, the media's reported on it, and it's not the first time it's happened, it's happened several times.
[01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:32.770]  Are you telling this, are you telling this committee that this does not happen?
[01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:38.271]  That there's no one in the White House who pushes the button and cuts him off in mid-sentence?
[01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:39.211]  That's correct.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:53.686]  So this didn't happen yesterday, nor on the other occasions where the media showed the American people that his sentence was cut off in mid-sentence?
[01:19:53.926 --> 01:19:54.066]  Yeah.
[01:19:54.506 --> 01:19:55.807]  Are you saying that didn't happen?
[01:19:56.307 --> 01:19:58.769]  Senator, I really don't know what you're referring to.
[01:19:58.789 --> 01:20:00.770]  All I can tell you is that this is not true.
[01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:01.770]  Look at the arrogance.
[01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.572]  If you're a TV viewer you can see the Secretary of State sitting there.
[01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:12.077]  And none one of the Chinese laugh at him and threaten to nuke him and say shut up to him when they've never treated Trump like that or anybody else.
[01:20:12.598 --> 01:20:19.664]  Because these guys don't respect their own government, their own country, their own elected President Trump, and the world doesn't see that as strong.
[01:20:19.704 --> 01:20:26.029]  They see that as America run by out-of-control bureaucracies who are all fighting with each other over power and control.
[01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:27.751]  This means we're extremely weak.
[01:20:29.315 --> 01:20:31.237]  And I don't say that with enjoyment.
[01:20:31.697 --> 01:20:32.778]  I have four children.
[01:20:32.918 --> 01:20:33.338]  I live here.
[01:20:33.358 --> 01:20:34.840]  I have a lot of pride in America.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.921]  It's been an exceptional country in its history.
[01:20:36.981 --> 01:20:37.802]  The most exceptional.
[01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:40.724]  People came here because they had a higher standard of freedom compared to other nations.
[01:20:42.286 --> 01:20:45.909]  But with great power comes great decadence, and we really have fallen.
[01:20:47.335 --> 01:20:57.618]  All right, we have Andrew Torba, who has one of the biggest independent sites out there to break down the incredible censorship and attacks, but also exciting things that are going on in just the state of the world.
[01:20:58.299 --> 01:21:03.860]  He's going to join us for 30 minutes, and then I'm going to continue with a ton of news on other subjects I haven't hit.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.261]  We could also open the phones up.
[01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:10.595]  I may just come up here tonight and do like a two, three hour special show and just take calls.
[01:21:10.995 --> 01:21:12.696]  Regardless, I'm going to start doing some of that.
[01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:18.639]  We're hiring extra crews so I can get that done because these are the times I need to be on air six, seven, eight hours.
[01:21:18.679 --> 01:21:23.721]  A lot of folks can't call in during the day and I like to do a commercial free show or pretty close to commercial free.
[01:21:24.242 --> 01:21:26.283]  This is just for the internet, just for a podcast.
[01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:28.284]  People request it, they really like it.
[01:21:28.304 --> 01:21:30.005]  I do the Saturday podcast most Saturdays.
[01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:32.126]  I did five and a half hours Saturday.
[01:21:32.146 --> 01:21:33.046]  The crew did a great job.
[01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:35.608]  That's what I want to do.
[01:21:35.628 --> 01:21:37.509]  This is historic time, and I'll just say this right now.
[01:21:37.529 --> 01:21:43.513]  I am working, no exaggeration, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:21:43.954 --> 01:21:45.055]  Hell, probably more than that.
[01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.255]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[01:21:46.876 --> 01:21:48.877]  But that's because I know how serious history is.
[01:21:50.543 --> 01:21:55.609]  I can't strategically get into all of the things that we're up to and the things we're doing, but I'll tell you this.
[01:21:55.689 --> 01:22:05.019]  If you want to see us on air in a year, and you want to see victory against the Globalists, and you want to see us fight this thing out as hard as we can to the end, you gotta feed an attack dog.
[01:22:05.711 --> 01:22:09.593]  You got to keep it in shape, and you got to walk it, and you got to keep it in position.
[01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:11.634]  And when it gets torn up, you got to sew it up.
[01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:12.794]  I want to fight.
[01:22:13.035 --> 01:22:14.455]  Believe me, that's all I want to do.
[01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:15.776]  I know who these people are.
[01:22:15.956 --> 01:22:17.997]  I am completely driven and turned over to this town.
[01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:25.661]  I am hitting another level of focus, and sometimes I get a little out of control because of it, because the focus gets so pure, and then when I get off of that, I want to go back there.
[01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.682]  I've never had focus like this when I've got it.
[01:22:28.062 --> 01:22:30.883]  And determination and commitment in your prayers, I can feel them.
[01:22:31.223 --> 01:22:32.304]  So three things I'm going to ask for.
[01:22:33.308 --> 01:22:41.736]  I need you to pray for me and my family and this operation and this crew and pray that I'll be steadfast and be in the high place of the Most High, the quiet place of the Most High that King David talked about.
[01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:49.103]  That the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit flow through me cleanly and that my flesh be washed away.
[01:22:49.263 --> 01:22:50.744]  I want to be a pure vessel against the enemy.
[01:22:50.764 --> 01:22:54.227]  I'll never be totally pure, but your prayers will have an effect and I need to pray that as well.
[01:22:54.267 --> 01:22:56.850]  I need to be a pure vessel for this and I'm far from it.
[01:22:59.062 --> 01:23:04.526]  And I also need you to financially support us and spread the word like your lives depend on it, because it does.
[01:23:04.866 --> 01:23:06.247]  This is damn real.
[01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:10.210]  People used to ask, how has he come off so convincing that this is crazy?
[01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:10.991]  He's a madman.
[01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:15.775]  Yes, I know to read Bill Gates talking about how he wants to kill you and your family, it sounds crazy, but it's real.
[01:23:16.375 --> 01:23:18.937]  I know the Georgia guides don't sound crazy, they're real.
[01:23:19.497 --> 01:23:23.720]  So I need funds, ladies and gentlemen, to fight the war at every level.
[01:23:23.761 --> 01:23:27.063]  We have to have our own infrastructure, our own backup, our own systems.
[01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:27.884]  We have to have it all.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:36.470]  And I need to be able to do this, and I need to have the money to do it, and not just have enough money to operate.
[01:23:36.791 --> 01:23:39.775]  I need to expand directly in their face.
[01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:43.239]  And I'm not going to tell you moves before I make them, but I need money.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:50.762]  So, we've got vitamins and supplements and t-shirts and books and films and water filters and air filters and all.
[01:23:51.102 --> 01:23:57.344]  People go, man, your air filter and water filter is like in the top two or three rated out of hundreds, and it's half the price of ones that aren't as good.
[01:23:57.584 --> 01:23:59.104]  Yeah, because we want to find the very best product.
[01:23:59.304 --> 01:24:01.665]  We don't have the philosophy of overcharging for something that doesn't work.
[01:24:04.592 --> 01:24:04.992]  It's all there.
[01:24:05.012 --> 01:24:07.974]  Our air filters, our water filters are all top of the line for very low prices.
[01:24:08.054 --> 01:24:09.315]  Storable food, same deal.
[01:24:09.835 --> 01:24:11.276]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:24:11.396 --> 01:24:12.757]  And we got a bunch of things back in stock.
[01:24:13.057 --> 01:24:15.979]  Winter sun, high quality D3, the number one thing for your immune system.
[01:24:16.239 --> 01:24:19.921]  Adults, children, old folks, especially folks with dark skin, you don't absorb as much sun as you know.
[01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:21.603]  Ultra 12, take it under the tongue.
[01:24:22.283 --> 01:24:25.185]  Again, Goddard's immune system, stamina, libido, energy, everything.
[01:24:25.485 --> 01:24:30.148]  We have a super concentrated liquid turmeric formula that is excellent.
[01:24:30.248 --> 01:24:31.489]  It's almost as strong.
[01:24:33.433 --> 01:24:34.994]  As bodies, but it's another formula.
[01:24:35.174 --> 01:24:46.463]  Its curcuminoids are very, very high, but I mean, nobody's got something at 97% or whatever the hell it is, 95% curcuminoid-like bodies, which we can't get the highest grades, which has been shut down, it ain't, it's not here for six months or whatever.
[01:24:46.924 --> 01:24:54.470]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, get your products and know you are funding the absolute resistance to tyranny at point-blank range.
[01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.031]  Take action now.
[01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.494]  I'm trying to, again, do as best I can in this fight.
[01:25:00.294 --> 01:25:01.336]  And I need your prayers.
[01:25:01.376 --> 01:25:02.137]  I need your financial support.
[01:25:02.177 --> 01:25:07.705]  And I need you, which I see a lot of folks doing, to take clips of the show, put it on Facebook, put it on Instagram, put it on YouTube.
[01:25:07.985 --> 01:25:09.747]  Don't put my name on it or the bots find it.
[01:25:11.169 --> 01:25:14.294]  And it's hitting and then it gets millions of views and they take it down.
[01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:16.998]  It's like whack-a-mole, but it's okay because we're winning.
[01:25:17.358 --> 01:25:22.800]  And InfoWars is having the biggest effect out there next to Tucker Carlson, and that is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.021]  I hope it gets a thousand times bigger and we win.
[01:25:25.061 --> 01:25:29.323]  I'm not in competition with Tucker, but he's the best thing we've got next to this operation.
[01:25:29.383 --> 01:25:33.005]  So, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:25:33.165 --> 01:25:36.126]  I do not have funding but through you.
[01:25:36.446 --> 01:25:37.727]  Plus, you need all these products.
[01:25:38.067 --> 01:25:39.688]  You should stock up on them now.
[01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:41.609]  There's a lot of other products we don't have time to get into.
[01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.650]  They're all available at infowarestore.com.
[01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:47.470]  We're gonna run the sale for at least one more week, 50% off.
[01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:54.492]  You will always have conspiracy theories when you have very challenging public health crises.
[01:25:55.233 --> 01:25:56.813]  They are nothing but distractions.
[01:25:56.973 --> 01:26:11.017]  You know, I can assure you, we have so much to do to protect the health and the welfare of the American people that I always just hope we just put those conspiracy stuff and let somebody write a book about it later on, but not now.
[01:26:12.628 --> 01:26:18.632]  The problem is you got some people out there who are fanning these conspiracy claims from the planet Pluto.
[01:26:19.453 --> 01:26:24.957]  And it's just disgusting what they're trying to say of all these crazy deep state malarkey.
[01:26:25.617 --> 01:26:32.162]  Well, later on, when the records were made public, it was not a conspiracy theory from the planet of Pluto, actually.
[01:26:32.983 --> 01:26:34.103]  There were inflated deaths.
[01:26:34.123 --> 01:26:38.667]  They were even taking gunshot wounds and categorizing them as COVID deaths.
[01:26:39.367 --> 01:26:44.710]  You're saying there is a massive pressure to artificially inflate the number of COVID-19 cases?
[01:26:45.131 --> 01:26:53.476]  Yeah, I have directly been told to, if a patient has fever and cough or anything similar, to put this COVID-like diagnosis on the chart.
[01:26:54.275 --> 01:27:01.361]  One of the big things the corporate media does to deceive the public is say, oh, there's all these crazies that don't believe a virus even exists.
[01:27:02.142 --> 01:27:04.104]  And they're saying nobody's dying.
[01:27:04.724 --> 01:27:06.546]  That's not what we're saying.
[01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:11.010]  COVID-19 is the greatest fraud ever pushed on mankind.
[01:27:12.051 --> 01:27:15.153]  It is not about a virus.
[01:27:15.934 --> 01:27:18.916]  I believe this is a psychological
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.162]  War upon society.
[01:27:22.902 --> 01:27:24.744]  What are the history books going to say about you?
[01:27:25.465 --> 01:27:27.766]  Do you stand up for common sense and critical thinking?
[01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:30.088]  I think the answer is clear what I'm going to be doing.
[01:27:30.689 --> 01:27:40.117]  What are you going to be doing?
[01:27:40.157 --> 01:27:45.942]  Secure your copy of COVIDland at covidland.com and start fighting back against the globalist lies.
[01:27:48.174 --> 01:27:53.077]  Wednesday, September 15th, 2021 is a special day for InfoWars.
[01:27:53.638 --> 01:28:00.322]  It's also going to be an important day for The Globalist, because it's the day that we start pre-sales on a new film.
[01:28:00.903 --> 01:28:04.766]  The first film InfoWars has released in more than nine years.
[01:28:05.606 --> 01:28:18.130]  COVID land exposes the globalist great reset corporate power grab and goes over every facet of how they launched the fraud and how they're using it to take control of our society in their own words.
[01:28:18.851 --> 01:28:21.052]  This is the medicine to the globalist tyranny.
[01:28:21.332 --> 01:28:24.853]  This is the antidote to their new world order takeover.
[01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:32.499]  And it's only part one in a five-part series that is going to be released within the next six months.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.904]  Every month and a half or so, a new part of the series will be released.
[01:28:37.944 --> 01:28:40.346]  And the first part is incredibly powerful.
[01:28:40.666 --> 01:28:49.515]  You can secure yours now in the pre-order that's going to go for three weeks at infowarestore.com or simply go to covidland.com.
[01:28:49.755 --> 01:29:02.708]  It'll take you directly to the sub page of infowarestore.com where you can order the film for $19.95 and get a free copy of my seminal film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement for free.
[01:29:03.248 --> 01:29:10.654]  You can get a second copy of Covidland, part one, the film, with another copy of Endgame for free for $29.95.
[01:29:11.655 --> 01:29:18.701]  So you have a copy for yourself, a copy to give others, and a copy of Endgame that predicted all of this, again, from the globalist's own words.
[01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:24.806]  But on top of that, not just Endgame, but also Covidland has a zero country code, meaning
[01:29:24.906 --> 01:29:25.226]  Of course.
[01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:43.731]  Take action now.
[01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:47.497]  Expose the globalist plan and we can stop these tyrants together.
[01:29:47.837 --> 01:29:55.808]  Secure your copy of COVID Land Part 1 today exclusively at InfoWarstore.com and it starts shipping in three weeks from September 15th, 2021.
[01:29:58.109 --> 01:30:05.836]  We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you, and we will take you to jail.
[01:30:06.257 --> 01:30:10.361]  The time for educating people into compliance is over.
[01:30:10.761 --> 01:30:14.284]  We're watching you, and we are going to take decisive action.
[01:30:14.645 --> 01:30:22.152]  If you are not in essential business, I'm using my power as governor under an emergency declaration to order you to close.
[01:30:23.704 --> 01:30:24.824]  New lockdowns are coming!
[01:30:24.844 --> 01:30:26.145]  See the full trailer at Vandot Video.
[01:30:26.245 --> 01:30:26.665]  Stay with us.
[01:30:26.685 --> 01:30:29.506]  Well, I talk a lot about it on air, but it's got a name.
[01:30:52.694 --> 01:30:56.076]  And it's parallel societies, parallel civilization.
[01:30:57.216 --> 01:31:02.719]  What did Europeans do when they were tired of not having religious freedom and being burned at the stake if they were Protestants or whatever?
[01:31:02.739 --> 01:31:09.403]  They left Holland, they left the Netherlands, they left England, they left Scotland, Ireland, they came to the United States.
[01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:12.799]  It doesn't mean they didn't set up some of the same oppression they left.
[01:31:12.819 --> 01:31:13.640]  That's the way it works.
[01:31:14.681 --> 01:31:19.263]  But that's why we're always running from the establishment and then we end up becoming it.
[01:31:19.344 --> 01:31:20.424]  That's really the paradox.
[01:31:20.484 --> 01:31:21.565]  But we need that rebirth.
[01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:25.828]  And people come from all the world, whether it's Africa or Latin America or Asia, to escape.
[01:31:26.508 --> 01:31:31.111]  The kingpins, the monopolies, the gangs that run their societies.
[01:31:31.151 --> 01:31:42.919]  But now we have a global government, a technocracy that spies on us and that ran a coup against Trump to remove him from office, claiming he wanted to use nuclear weapons when he didn't, to have the military already ready to take him out as Pelosi bragged and bragged she met
[01:31:43.639 --> 01:31:44.940]  And talk to Millie?
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.502]  That's all in the news, these claims.
[01:31:46.582 --> 01:31:49.364]  She bragged back in the time, oh, the military will remove him.
[01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:57.330]  And she had them all parade out there and she walked in front of the troops at the Capitol in that fascist symbol of bringing the troops into the Capitol showing her power.
[01:31:58.231 --> 01:32:01.394]  Not since Julius Caesar have we seen that at a republic like this.
[01:32:04.133 --> 01:32:10.535]  Andrew Torba, I usually try to get him on, he's a very busy guy, and he's usually like, hey, you're doing great, but I can't come on right now, I'm launching so much stuff.
[01:32:11.115 --> 01:32:15.076]  But he called me this weekend, he said, I got something really exciting to talk about, and exciting things to gab.
[01:32:15.436 --> 01:32:23.119]  I said, absolutely, we've got to codify this, we've got to define this, we've got to move to do this, because there's two tracks, really.
[01:32:23.799 --> 01:32:28.120]  Try to defeat the globalists, take our countries back, but that's looking really bad right now, isn't it?
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:30.661]  Because they control all the regulators and law enforcement at the federal level.
[01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:35.433]  Or just withdraw from the system and start doing what they want.
[01:32:35.473 --> 01:32:36.935]  They want to bully us out of their big stores.
[01:32:36.955 --> 01:32:38.076]  They want to bully us off their systems.
[01:32:38.517 --> 01:32:39.939]  Let's start our own airline.
[01:32:39.959 --> 01:32:41.161]  There's a lot of folks that money can do that.
[01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:43.184]  If it get popular right away, they'd buy more planes.
[01:32:43.204 --> 01:32:44.125]  That's how innovation works.
[01:32:44.185 --> 01:32:47.109]  Or start our own social media network.
[01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:48.590]  Mr. Torbat's done.
[01:32:48.811 --> 01:32:49.771]  So that's what he's getting at.
[01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:50.572]  I appreciate him.
[01:32:50.952 --> 01:32:54.634]  From Gab.com to Center.com, Andrew Torbat joining us.
[01:32:55.034 --> 01:32:57.276]  Left Silicon Valley in November 2016.
[01:32:57.536 --> 01:33:09.443]  Started his site, they've attacked, and now it is one of the only two or three successful sites out there that actually isn't censoring people and is like the Internet was just four or five years ago, somewhat free.
[01:33:09.783 --> 01:33:10.884]  So Andrew, thanks for joining us.
[01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:12.925]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:33:12.945 --> 01:33:14.706]  You know, it's been an interesting month.
[01:33:14.786 --> 01:33:17.548]  We had the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN.
[01:33:18.269 --> 01:33:31.093]  Even Congress come after Gab after I had, you know, thousands of people reaching out and saying, you know, my workplace, the military, you know, all these different places are forcing these vaccines or mandating these vaccines.
[01:33:31.193 --> 01:33:31.933]  What can we do?
[01:33:32.654 --> 01:33:36.635]  So I, you know, pulled together the resources that we have on Gab from people all over the world.
[01:33:37.135 --> 01:33:45.798]  And we came up with a bunch of different templates to provide people with religious exemption templates that they could use, whether they're Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox.
[01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.655]  I think we're good to go.
[01:34:10.809 --> 01:34:13.410]  You know, maybe you're going to have to pull your kids out of school.
[01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:14.790]  Maybe you're going to have to get a new job.
[01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:16.311]  Maybe you're going to have to move somewhere else.
[01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:21.952]  It's going to be hard, but really, I see us as being the modern-day pilgrims.
[01:34:22.713 --> 01:34:28.554]  Was it difficult for the pilgrims to up and leave and come to a new land and start fresh and start building something new?
[01:34:28.654 --> 01:34:29.155]  Of course!
[01:34:29.595 --> 01:34:35.857]  Was it difficult for, you know, first century Christians to spread the gospel, you know, among hostile territories?
[01:34:36.277 --> 01:34:36.797]  Absolutely!
[01:34:37.137 --> 01:34:38.658]  But, you know, look what we got because of that.
[01:34:38.678 --> 01:34:43.360]  We got the greatest country on the face of the earth because of what the Pilgrims did, because of the courage that they had.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:51.144]  And I think that we could do something similar now if they don't want us to participate in their system, if they want us to inject ourselves with these vaccines.
[01:34:51.184 --> 01:34:58.408]  And by the way, the most interesting trend that I'm seeing now is people who did get the first vaccination and are now being, you know, questioning it.
[01:34:58.508 --> 01:35:04.911]  They're saying, wait a minute, I thought I was fully vaccinated and now I'm going to have to be getting these booster shots and these twice daily pills and all this stuff.
[01:35:05.419 --> 01:35:05.919]  I don't think so.
[01:35:28.137 --> 01:35:28.297]  I think?
[01:35:46.308 --> 01:35:47.249]  They're leaving their jobs.
[01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:50.752]  They're moving to different states that are more friendly to freedom.
[01:35:51.072 --> 01:35:56.856]  So, you know, this is this concept of a parallel society where, you know, the system and the deep state, they want us to fight back.
[01:35:56.896 --> 01:35:58.077]  They want us to get violent.
[01:35:58.398 --> 01:36:04.142]  They want us to, you know, try to attack them or, you know, try to frame things in that way.
[01:36:04.482 --> 01:36:06.224]  That is not what we should do.
[01:36:06.324 --> 01:36:09.106]  What we should do is withdraw from their systems completely.
[01:36:09.506 --> 01:36:13.627]  Turn off the TV, pull your kids out of school, move to a different state, get a new job.
[01:36:13.687 --> 01:36:15.488]  And notice, Andrew, they know that's the power.
[01:36:15.548 --> 01:36:16.388]  They want a war.
[01:36:16.728 --> 01:36:17.828]  They say we're going to get violent.
[01:36:17.848 --> 01:36:18.629]  They keep pushing.
[01:36:18.909 --> 01:36:25.351]  Toshuab says he wants to create a collapse all over the world and civil war by cutting resources off, like we're too dumb to know that.
[01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:34.133]  The answer is pull out of their system, put our resources together, and just like the Jews 3,000 years ago, leave Egypt, exodus.
[01:36:34.553 --> 01:36:37.194]  And we may have to wander around for a while, but that's just the way it is.
[01:36:38.391 --> 01:36:38.972]  Exactly.
[01:36:39.413 --> 01:36:39.934]  Absolutely.
[01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:42.418]  I mean, what we need to do is we need to remain peaceful.
[01:36:42.438 --> 01:36:43.400]  We're builders, Alex.
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:46.025]  You know, we're critical thinkers, we're doers, we're builders.
[01:36:46.466 --> 01:36:51.074]  That is what people like us have always done throughout all of history, and it's time
[01:36:51.725 --> 01:36:55.146]  We're at a critical point in history right now where we need to do that again.
[01:36:55.586 --> 01:36:58.607]  So, you know, we need to embrace the change.
[01:36:58.627 --> 01:37:08.629]  We need to embrace the ability for our, you know, that God gave us to build and to, you know, create a new parallel society where we have our own social networks.
[01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:10.249]  We have our own version of the Internet.
[01:37:10.429 --> 01:37:13.730]  And by the way, you kind of look like Miles Standish here, and you've already started.
[01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:16.650]  So this is a virtual exit as you're doing.
[01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:18.271]  You're kind of the Miles Standish 2.0 here.
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.741]  Sure, sure, that's fine.
[01:37:21.801 --> 01:37:23.281]  I mean, this is not a new concept.
[01:37:23.341 --> 01:37:29.004]  It's been done many times before, but I believe that we're, again, at a point in time in history where it needs to be done right now.
[01:37:29.364 --> 01:37:30.984]  And really, they've left us no choice, right?
[01:37:31.004 --> 01:37:47.131]  So, you know, you see that, you know, they're mandating these vaccines, and I'm having a lot of people that are telling me that the religious exemption is working, but then I'm having also a lot of people telling me that it's not working, and they're not accepting, even though they're claiming that they're accepting religious exemptions, they're not allowing it.
[01:37:47.151 --> 01:37:47.871]  So those folks are
[01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:50.572]  You know looking to start their own businesses.
[01:37:50.672 --> 01:38:15.360]  I have I've seen doctors that are saying I'm leaving my hospital I'm starting my own private practice You know these things are happening people are leaving the system and they are building and what's going to be left in the system is These these yes men who will go out and get the 15th booster shot in order to keep their job and my heart goes out to these people but you know really what what the existing system is going to be left with is a lot of incompetent sheep and you know with that type of You know
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.301]  I think so.
[01:38:34.638 --> 01:38:49.947]  That aren't going to go along with the mask mandates and all this stuff anymore Those are the businesses that are going to thrive and you know with free market forces inevitably Those businesses are going to come up on top and this this new society this parallel society that we're building is Going to become the dominant society.
[01:38:50.207 --> 01:38:55.130]  It's going to take a little bit, but we can't do it We just have to start building we have to start exiting the system.
[01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:59.272]  You know delete your Facebook account stop watching the mainstream news networks and
[01:38:59.472 --> 01:39:06.118]  Pull your kids out of school where they're being indoctrinated and told they're evil because of their skin color and because of their political opinions.
[01:39:07.018 --> 01:39:09.701]  And they're being told to wear masks for 10 hours a day.
[01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:11.762]  We have to stop this madness.
[01:39:11.802 --> 01:39:13.083]  We have to say enough is enough.
[01:39:13.203 --> 01:39:14.945]  Enough of us need to say enough is enough.
[01:39:15.285 --> 01:39:20.468]  And I think we're at that point in history where we just have to start building and we have to say, I'm done with this system.
[01:39:20.568 --> 01:39:21.548]  We're going to go our own way.
[01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:25.250]  We're going to move to states that embrace freedom and defend freedom.
[01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:33.295]  We're going to move to areas where we're around people who support our values and we're going to support businesses and help build businesses that support our values.
[01:39:34.232 --> 01:39:35.653]  And Andrew, let's expand on that.
[01:39:36.454 --> 01:39:38.235]  We're not the one holding the globalists hostage.
[01:39:38.295 --> 01:39:38.956]  They took over.
[01:39:38.976 --> 01:39:39.696]  They hijacked.
[01:39:39.716 --> 01:39:40.697]  They bought off the corporations.
[01:39:40.737 --> 01:39:41.618]  They bought off the government.
[01:39:42.158 --> 01:39:46.101]  They're trying to get us into a thing with gene therapy that destroys our immune systems and makes us really sick.
[01:39:46.421 --> 01:39:47.222]  They're taking over.
[01:39:47.242 --> 01:39:48.343]  They're making us dependent.
[01:39:49.043 --> 01:39:50.384]  They're putting us into bondage.
[01:39:50.464 --> 01:39:53.827]  And so we should pull out and not comply with their system.
[01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:55.128]  It's totally illegitimate.
[01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:56.409]  It's not just our right.
[01:39:56.489 --> 01:39:57.089]  It's our duty.
[01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.870]  And as you said,
[01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:03.834]  Massive numbers of the people that took the first injections are pissed now, because they got told, two shots, you're totally protected.
[01:40:03.854 --> 01:40:05.034]  Now it's three, it's four, it's five.
[01:40:05.335 --> 01:40:09.077]  Oh, it's ten a year, and now there's pills you gotta take and an app to leave your house.
[01:40:09.477 --> 01:40:16.362]  This is such a dystopia, and people need to wake up and say no before they're totally in a prison, and then it's too late to get out of it.
[01:40:16.422 --> 01:40:17.603]  Andrew Torma, when we come back.
[01:40:18.143 --> 01:40:20.906]  I want to talk more about parallel civilization, parallel society.
[01:40:20.926 --> 01:40:24.649]  Because the globalists are actually building their parallel society while they wreck ours.
[01:40:24.969 --> 01:40:31.555]  What you're saying is, let's pull out of their controlled demolition and save and rebuild what we can, but based on American values.
[01:40:32.436 --> 01:40:35.659]  We are back with Andrew Torba of Gab.com.
[01:40:35.699 --> 01:40:38.482]  And you know, he laughed when I said you're like Miles Standish that led the
[01:40:40.404 --> 01:40:42.607]  First Pilgrim Expedition here to the United States.
[01:40:43.268 --> 01:40:49.076]  They had a few other expeditions like Jamestown, but they'd all been found basically killed and eaten by the natives.
[01:40:49.637 --> 01:40:51.259]  But this was the first successful mission.
[01:40:52.452 --> 01:40:54.394]  And what he is doing is trailblazing.
[01:40:54.794 --> 01:40:56.055]  And Infowars is trailblazing.
[01:40:56.075 --> 01:40:58.156]  When Listener Support the Broadcast is trailblazing.
[01:40:58.597 --> 01:41:04.801]  When you go to Gab and visit our pages or Andrew's and share the links, those places are getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:41:04.861 --> 01:41:08.264]  That's why they have the Republican Party of Texas wanting Gab shut down.
[01:41:08.724 --> 01:41:13.568]  Just because it's like Facebook five years ago and as long as you're not calling for murder or selling drugs, you can do it.
[01:41:14.108 --> 01:41:19.212]  Doesn't mean we agree with saying white people are inherently bad or black people are inherently bad, but there's a few people on there doing that.
[01:41:19.632 --> 01:41:21.494]  Hell, Democrats do it on national TV, but
[01:41:22.054 --> 01:41:25.037]  And they go, oh, you know, Gab needs to be brought down because they have speech.
[01:41:25.377 --> 01:41:26.598]  Infowars needs to be brought down.
[01:41:26.658 --> 01:41:27.739]  It's so horrible.
[01:41:27.759 --> 01:41:30.881]  All the New York Times lies about WMDs on purpose.
[01:41:31.782 --> 01:41:33.383]  So that's that's what's happening.
[01:41:33.403 --> 01:41:39.508]  It's a revolutionary act to get involved in this mental exodus, spiritual exodus from the globalist.
[01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:41.350]  I never really liked Hollywood.
[01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.910]  Now I hate it.
[01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:44.406]  I never really liked Facebook, now I hate it.
[01:41:45.107 --> 01:41:52.665]  And I only use those things and those venues to get the word out about what we're doing, but I don't marvel at it, I don't like it, I don't want acceptance by it.
[01:41:53.686 --> 01:41:56.187]  Look at a Hollywood star walk.
[01:41:56.687 --> 01:41:59.628]  They're all a bunch of crazy hypocrites, a bunch of frauds.
[01:41:59.648 --> 01:42:02.049]  You're talking about a parallel society, Andrew.
[01:42:02.869 --> 01:42:10.491]  The globalists own their own private islands, their own castles, their own fortresses, their own 300,000 acre ranches that Bill Gates and people like Ted Turner have.
[01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.552]  But they say we should live in 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[01:42:13.572 --> 01:42:17.473]  So they're already breaking away from us so they can carry out their operations.
[01:42:17.493 --> 01:42:19.014]  That's why it's important for us to basically
[01:42:22.274 --> 01:42:26.775]  Absolutely.
[01:42:27.735 --> 01:42:29.076]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:42:29.196 --> 01:42:32.156]  Ultimately, it comes down to, you know, what is your freedom worth to you?
[01:42:32.797 --> 01:42:34.017]  To me, it's worth everything, right?
[01:42:34.037 --> 01:42:37.838]  So, I want the freedom to worship in my church without permission from the state.
[01:42:38.178 --> 01:42:43.039]  I want the freedom to work without being forced to inject myself with a substance that I don't want in my body.
[01:42:43.459 --> 01:42:48.500]  I want the freedom to have a political opinion on the internet without being banned from banks and social networks.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:58.329]  I want the freedom for my children to learn without having, you know, this disgusting and unhealthy dirty mask over their face for eight hours a day and being told that they're evil for their skin color.
[01:42:58.729 --> 01:43:01.912]  Now, are these freedoms worth making an effort to preserve and protect?
[01:43:02.113 --> 01:43:03.013]  I believe that they are.
[01:43:03.634 --> 01:43:05.596]  And it's time to start acting like it, right?
[01:43:05.636 --> 01:43:07.738]  Like we have to start doing something.
[01:43:08.394 --> 01:43:09.455]  They want us to get violent.
[01:43:09.495 --> 01:43:13.096]  That is not the approach that we need to take because they will crush us.
[01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:16.077]  And they would have no other way.
[01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:19.918]  They would love to be able to have an excuse to annihilate us, right?
[01:43:19.938 --> 01:43:20.699]  That's what they want.
[01:43:20.999 --> 01:43:22.159]  So we cannot give in to that.
[01:43:22.339 --> 01:43:24.340]  That's why they provocateur January 6th.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.201]  And now we know Millie and all them were heavily involved.
[01:43:27.221 --> 01:43:28.802]  They were trying to have a coup against Trump.
[01:43:29.062 --> 01:43:34.404]  They planned on being way more violent, using their coup operatives to manipulate the small number of folks that did go in.
[01:43:35.529 --> 01:43:45.897]  They want any excuse to destroy us, any excuse to shut us up, any excuse to ostracize us from society, and we're seeing that happen and unfold before our eyes.
[01:43:45.977 --> 01:43:49.099]  If they want to ostracize us from their society, fine.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:44:01.569]  We will up and leave and we will build our own new society that is grounded in Christian American values that have been at the forefront, at the ground, at the core of this country for hundreds of years.
[01:44:02.017 --> 01:44:07.201]  And we have tens of millions of people on our side and more and more people are waking up every single day.
[01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:12.245]  Again, like I said, it's not just the quote unquote unvaccinated, which they claim it's 80 million people.
[01:44:12.305 --> 01:44:13.406]  It's probably even more.
[01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:21.432]  Those numbers are probably bogus, but you know, it's also the people that got one or two shots that are saying, wait a minute, you know, I was told that if I got this, things would go back to normal.
[01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:25.255]  We look at Israel where they're on, you know, shot number four, I think it is.
[01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:27.245]  Their COVID cases are exploding.
[01:44:27.265 --> 01:44:29.167]  They're the most vaccinated country in the world.
[01:44:29.227 --> 01:44:32.171]  So clearly the vaccinations are not the solution here.
[01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.593]  It's all about control.
[01:44:33.653 --> 01:44:38.378]  It's about eliminating and pushing and ostracizing as much of us as many of us as possible.
[01:44:38.398 --> 01:44:39.219]  It's about divide and conquer.
[01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.221]  Let me ask you about this.
[01:44:41.002 --> 01:44:43.124]  I saw this pushed on Facebook to me everywhere.
[01:44:44.005 --> 01:44:52.950]  Saying a local TV station, we know those are the ones like the fake Ivermectin, Story Poisoning, everybody, they use locals because they're more, quote, believable to the average people.
[01:44:53.131 --> 01:44:59.254]  But now we know Facebook and others were partnering with them and it said, tell us about your loved ones that got sick or died because they didn't have the vaccine.
[01:44:59.735 --> 01:45:02.496]  No one responded out of 36,000 people, basically.
[01:45:02.756 --> 01:45:07.599]  Everybody else said, my dad had a heart attack, my sister died, my 12-year-old son just died, or 13-year-old.
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:13.103]  It was a nightmare of just absolute hell on earth of what happened to the people.
[01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:23.211]  Again, as of when this article I read this morning, 30 plus thousand respondents, 99% negative, to WXYZ TV channel.
[01:45:23.591 --> 01:45:25.372]  And folks, that's a real TV channel.
[01:45:25.693 --> 01:45:26.013]  Channel 7.
[01:45:26.914 --> 01:45:31.017]  That's the level of people begging to have someplace to tell them about the hell they're discovering.
[01:45:31.297 --> 01:45:33.559]  What are you seeing as reports on Gab?
[01:45:33.919 --> 01:45:38.323]  I'm seeing funerals all over Austin of teenage boys and girls dying of heart attacks after they take this.
[01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:41.048]  Yep, we're seeing this all over Gab.
[01:45:41.088 --> 01:45:51.800]  These people, they're trying to share their story on the big social networks, and they're getting censored, they're getting banned, and they're coming to Gab to share their story, where of course they're met with open arms from our community.
[01:45:52.862 --> 01:45:54.443]  These stories are just heartbreaking.
[01:45:54.463 --> 01:45:55.605]  We're seeing a lot of young men
[01:45:56.205 --> 01:45:58.625]  Who are having heart attacks, heart problems from this thing.
[01:45:58.946 --> 01:46:01.566]  There's risks that are just not being discussed.
[01:46:01.586 --> 01:46:03.086]  We have no long-term studies.
[01:46:03.386 --> 01:46:11.388]  They just want to force as many of us to take this vaccine as possible for a virus that, you know, the vast majority of the population has a 99% chance of surviving.
[01:46:11.828 --> 01:46:24.530]  So, you know, we have to understand that we have to give these people a voice and we have to weigh the risk of, you know, injecting this stuff into our bodies when we have no long-term consequences, no long-term studies that we understand right now.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.321]  And we're seeing these people flood on Gab that are sharing these stories like this.
[01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.782]  And I did see this one on Facebook.
[01:46:29.802 --> 01:46:31.683]  I'm actually surprised it didn't get removed yet.
[01:46:31.763 --> 01:46:32.983]  It probably has at this point.
[01:46:33.023 --> 01:46:40.366]  But yeah, they asked for, you know, stories of people that, you know, had family members that had died or had problems with COVID.
[01:46:40.426 --> 01:46:47.769]  And every single comment was no, actually, I had a family member that died or had severe problems or complications because of the vaccine.
[01:46:47.789 --> 01:46:49.430]  And we're seeing more and more of these stories.
[01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:54.132]  So, you know, and then you'll have the New York Times call me a disinformation agent for literally
[01:46:54.492 --> 01:46:59.013]  Just telling and sharing these stories of these people that are telling these stories on Gab.
[01:46:59.033 --> 01:47:08.896]  And let's talk about how important it is to support Gab and to support Infowars and some of the other groups out there that don't see censoring like Rumble, but you've got the most multifaceted group out there right now.
[01:47:08.936 --> 01:47:10.276]  We're not in competition, the more the merrier.
[01:47:10.856 --> 01:47:12.657]  Take Ernest Ramirez.
[01:47:12.817 --> 01:47:17.038]  I didn't even know, he didn't complain when he was on my show, that they had banned his GoFundMe
[01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:34.367]  Just to raise money to try to put ads on the internet to tell people about his son and to warn people to check his son was in good health, started to play basketball, had a heart attack five days after the Moderna shot, and they won't even let him on their Facebook, blocked him, and said you can't show your local Fox News clip about your dead son.
[01:47:34.407 --> 01:47:36.048]  I mean, that is so damn criminal.
[01:47:37.153 --> 01:47:37.733]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:37.813 --> 01:47:38.733]  GoFundMe is horrible.
[01:47:38.753 --> 01:47:43.355]  I would recommend that people use GiveSendGo, which is the Christian GoFundMe alternative.
[01:47:44.615 --> 01:47:45.375]  They're on Gab.
[01:47:45.675 --> 01:47:48.536]  We've seen a lot of Gabbers use them instead of GoFundMe.
[01:47:48.836 --> 01:47:50.677]  GoFundMe is just highly politicized.
[01:47:50.737 --> 01:47:56.118]  If you're raising money for anything that goes against the narrative of the machine, then it's going to get removed.
[01:47:56.718 --> 01:47:59.199]  But yeah, I think Gab is fully supported by our users.
[01:47:59.599 --> 01:48:12.010]  We're launching our advertising program and we're seeing small businesses and business owners on Gab that are doing phenomenally well with that and you know it's part of building this alternative society, this alternative economy.
[01:48:12.355 --> 01:48:16.019]  So people are emailing me and they're saying, hey, I'm leaving my job.
[01:48:16.079 --> 01:48:17.120]  I'm starting my own business.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.884]  I want to advertise on Gab to help get the word out and help get this started.
[01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:22.466]  And we'd love to see that.
[01:48:22.526 --> 01:48:31.936]  We're also going to be launching a marketplace later this year to compete with Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Craigslist, all those guys to help commerce happen on Gab.
[01:48:32.496 --> 01:48:44.460]  That is, you know, what we're building here is this infrastructure for an alternative parallel society, alternative parallel economy, where, you know, you don't have to get injected with something in order to run a business.
[01:48:45.001 --> 01:48:49.502]  And there's the article, Building Infrastructure for a Parallel Digital Economy.
[01:48:50.243 --> 01:48:50.743]  That's it.
[01:48:51.303 --> 01:48:54.384]  Gab, just search for parallel economy.
[01:48:54.504 --> 01:48:58.225]  We'll be right back to talk about something really positive that's coming out of all of this.
[01:48:58.666 --> 01:48:59.606]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:49:00.822 --> 01:49:03.869]  So I talked about this some Friday on air.
[01:49:03.889 --> 01:49:08.961]  I had talked to several Texas doctors that run Major Rendez-Savir.
[01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.690]  Counter systems, which is the Regeneron.
[01:49:13.090 --> 01:49:20.452]  It's the Rendesivir that's got a 57% chance, 58% chance of killing you if you have COVID and you take it, but that's the thing Fauci pushes.
[01:49:21.052 --> 01:49:29.073]  The thing that in studies and tests is actually approved and it went through all the process is Regeneron, but you got to get it early because the stuff already does the damage to your lungs.
[01:49:29.653 --> 01:49:33.254]  And whatever they're putting out there now is a lot more serious than the COVID we saw last year.
[01:49:33.594 --> 01:49:34.494]  That was mainly hype.
[01:49:35.714 --> 01:49:37.835]  A lot of scientists think it's being shed off the virus.
[01:49:37.895 --> 01:49:39.435]  Others say it's a bio weapon they've released.
[01:49:40.598 --> 01:49:41.239]  Another strain.
[01:49:41.379 --> 01:49:47.047]  And look how it popped up in Texas and Florida, the places the globalists are targeting.
[01:49:47.087 --> 01:49:51.253]  But censorship isn't just about political stuff.
[01:49:51.313 --> 01:49:53.176]  It's about big tech merging with big pharma.
[01:49:55.009 --> 01:50:02.631]  And it's about once they've merged, which they've done, then they have a stake in suppressing people for profits, but also it's about depopulation.
[01:50:03.111 --> 01:50:07.753]  And Google and Facebook both invested at the Wuhan lab with Peter Daszak.
[01:50:07.813 --> 01:50:14.455]  And then you have the head lab lady under Daszak running the Facebook global response to COVID.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.281]  That's why they were so bold to cook this up and the evidence is overwhelming to release it on purpose.
[01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:20.281]  It wasn't an accidental leak.
[01:50:20.301 --> 01:50:30.024]  It was because they had control of the media and big tech and of the regulators and they could get away with it and you see the power they've used lockstep worldwide to take over.
[01:50:30.044 --> 01:50:33.585]  Look at this latest article on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:35.131 --> 01:50:43.813]  Biden and men limiting supply of monoclonal antibodies in seven southern states under guise of preventing a shortage.
[01:50:43.873 --> 01:50:49.815]  Even though there's 500 million doses, it only takes one dose, more than enough for every American, and then some, over 150 million extra.
[01:50:50.435 --> 01:50:59.217]  And we first got reports this last week, now the article links to local news, in Texas and other states where indeed they are not letting people have it.
[01:51:01.647 --> 01:51:05.590]  They're also blocking these GlaxoSmithKline ones, which are not as good.
[01:51:05.970 --> 01:51:07.411]  That's only one antibody.
[01:51:07.871 --> 01:51:08.752]  Regeneron has two.
[01:51:09.432 --> 01:51:14.055]  So I've talked to a lot of medical doctors that don't sell it, but are actually involved in it, and those that actually run these operations.
[01:51:14.716 --> 01:51:16.937]  So I don't know of any side effects it has.
[01:51:17.458 --> 01:51:18.398]  I'm sure it probably does.
[01:51:18.458 --> 01:51:19.339]  Everything does in this world.
[01:51:19.699 --> 01:51:25.443]  But it's actually been proven to have a 70 plus percent save your rate of folks that are already actually sick with it.
[01:51:25.643 --> 01:51:27.424]  It's like 99 percent of you just got it.
[01:51:27.925 --> 01:51:29.586]  So regardless, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:51:30.967 --> 01:51:44.056]  This is a level of censorship, censoring ivermectin, censoring iboxychloroquine, censoring vitamin D, censoring zinc, censoring that natural immunity is 13 to 27 times better for COVID in the Israeli study and others show similar numbers.
[01:51:44.096 --> 01:51:45.898]  So this is about life and death.
[01:51:45.958 --> 01:51:47.339]  My people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:51:47.659 --> 01:51:49.640]  Andrew Torba, that's the bad news.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.822]  I want you to elaborate on that if you like, but also good news.
[01:51:53.331 --> 01:51:57.012]  America and other countries that are freer were founded from persecution.
[01:51:57.052 --> 01:52:00.153]  So we've lost our way, but a large part of us haven't.
[01:52:00.433 --> 01:52:01.614]  We're going to recreate that.
[01:52:02.094 --> 01:52:06.875]  And I know they've lit a fire under you, they've lit a fire under me to work harder, to be more focused than ever.
[01:52:06.895 --> 01:52:10.656]  And the fact that now it's out in the open and they're openly trying to enslave us.
[01:52:11.077 --> 01:52:12.937]  And I think they've bit off more than they chew.
[01:52:12.977 --> 01:52:14.678]  And I know they launched this global attack.
[01:52:15.498 --> 01:52:19.279]  Because they were losing control already with Trump and Bolsonaro and all the other movements.
[01:52:19.759 --> 01:52:22.520]  And so this was their lockstep plan to get control again.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.120]  They admit that.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:29.662]  So the fact that they were forced to do something this out of control shows me how really weak they are.
[01:52:30.042 --> 01:52:31.603]  This is all going to be a real opportunity.
[01:52:31.783 --> 01:52:34.084]  I'm not in this to, quote, just make money.
[01:52:34.124 --> 01:52:34.824]  I want to be free.
[01:52:34.904 --> 01:52:39.305]  But so many folks say, man, I wish I'd have known about that long beforehand.
[01:52:39.725 --> 01:52:41.346]  This is a rant, but I want you to elaborate on it.
[01:52:42.082 --> 01:52:44.945]  Well, this is the whole future, the whole renaissance, the whole world.
[01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.047]  The money will be in patriot communities.
[01:52:48.148 --> 01:52:49.669]  The money will be in Christian communities.
[01:52:49.909 --> 01:52:54.793]  The whole future of innovation and prosperity and freedom is going to be freedom.
[01:52:55.074 --> 01:52:59.638]  All the fake tech and all the bots and all that is crap if humans aren't interfacing with it.
[01:52:59.938 --> 01:53:02.960]  So if the people interfacing with it aren't free, it has zero value.
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:10.604]  The whole future is freedom, and we're promoting freedom, so everybody should get on board, because where the globalists are taking us is total destruction.
[01:53:10.824 --> 01:53:26.392]  Why wouldn't everybody just say no to the short-term profit of being a slave in a system, and instead take up the chance to be trailblazers into the future, and be the new builders that launch the new civilization, and people will look back on what we did as an example to the future?
[01:53:27.671 --> 01:53:28.412]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:53:28.432 --> 01:53:30.013]  You know, now is the time to start building.
[01:53:30.033 --> 01:53:31.314]  I've been saying this for five years.
[01:53:31.354 --> 01:53:33.656]  This is what we've been doing here for five years.
[01:53:33.716 --> 01:53:38.259]  This is what you've been doing for 20 plus years is going our own way, trailblazing.
[01:53:38.359 --> 01:53:40.701]  Someone has to knock over that first domino.
[01:53:41.082 --> 01:53:45.565]  Someone has to carry that cross up the hill and we have to start doing it right now.
[01:53:46.226 --> 01:53:49.188]  We don't realize how much purchasing power we have.
[01:53:49.588 --> 01:53:53.451]  How much power we have just in where we spend our time and how we spend our time.
[01:53:53.831 --> 01:53:58.774]  You know, we don't have to, you know, change the whole system from the inside out.
[01:53:58.794 --> 01:54:00.615]  I think it's beyond saving at this point.
[01:54:00.915 --> 01:54:03.977]  We need to just start new, start building from scratch.
[01:54:04.117 --> 01:54:06.499]  And, you know, the good news is that, you know, we are Americans.
[01:54:06.579 --> 01:54:07.720]  This is in our blood.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.860]  This is in our souls.
[01:54:09.241 --> 01:54:09.981]  We're builders.
[01:54:10.541 --> 01:54:11.262]  We're conquerors.
[01:54:11.687 --> 01:54:12.728]  We get things done.
[01:54:12.848 --> 01:54:18.832]  We have built the greatest country on the face of the planet in the history of humanity and we can do it again.
[01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:27.717]  We can start over and build from scratch if we unite together as one and start building and start working on this parallel society.
[01:54:28.077 --> 01:54:29.098]  It's not going to happen.
[01:54:29.138 --> 01:54:31.740]  We're not going to be able to overtake these institutions.
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:34.782]  They're fully captured by the enemy and it's time to accept that.
[01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:38.233]  You know, stop sending your kids to these schools that are fully captured.
[01:54:38.533 --> 01:54:50.063]  Stop watching TV programs and entertainment and all this other stuff that is fully captured and is just pumping, you know, lies and propaganda and nonsense in your face 24-7 to demoralize you.
[01:54:50.763 --> 01:54:54.647]  You have to take back control of your own home and of your own life and of your own backyard.
[01:54:54.667 --> 01:54:56.308]  I've been talking about this a lot as well.
[01:54:56.689 --> 01:55:00.412]  We have to recapture our own towns, our own cities, our own neighborhoods.
[01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:06.259]  We're so focused, we're so consumed on the day-to-day drama that's going on in D.C.
[01:55:06.299 --> 01:55:10.043]  when most of it really does not have that big of an impact on our lives day-to-day.
[01:55:10.464 --> 01:55:15.971]  Where we do have a big day-to-day impact is what's going on in our city council, what's going on at our local school board.
[01:55:16.371 --> 01:55:18.534]  Go show up, get involved in local politics.
[01:55:18.934 --> 01:55:19.695]  Run for school board.
[01:55:33.991 --> 01:55:36.274]  The $50,000-a-plate Democrat function.
[01:55:36.594 --> 01:55:41.059]  She's wearing a designer dress about tax the rich, while all the servants gotta wear masks.
[01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:43.461]  I mean, this is Rome in decline.
[01:55:43.581 --> 01:55:47.265]  This is Marie Antoinette, hours before the storming of the Bastille.
[01:55:47.505 --> 01:55:49.968]  This is the end of this global empire and their Ponzi scheme.
[01:55:50.208 --> 01:55:55.354]  They want it to be the end of us, and their great reset, and with the great reset of them, if we simply stop complying.
[01:55:56.514 --> 01:55:56.954]  Absolutely.
[01:55:56.974 --> 01:56:01.897]  You know, it's been three days talking about the dress that AOC wore at the Met Gala with the elites.
[01:56:02.318 --> 01:56:05.179]  Instead of, holy cow, people are being fired.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:12.444]  People are being forced to choose between providing from their families and being injected with this experimental substance that they don't want in their bodies.
[01:56:12.864 --> 01:56:14.025]  This is a huge deal.
[01:56:14.645 --> 01:56:15.826]  And nobody's talking about it.
[01:56:15.846 --> 01:56:18.668]  Everybody's so distracted by these nuances of
[01:56:18.988 --> 01:56:19.369]  Yes, we are.
[01:56:34.444 --> 01:56:34.585]  I think?
[01:56:52.285 --> 01:56:56.067]  They're going to keep pushing the limits as far as they can until we say enough is enough.
[01:56:56.547 --> 01:56:58.127]  And that's the point that we're at right now.
[01:56:58.388 --> 01:56:59.128]  I totally agree.
[01:56:59.168 --> 01:57:06.411]  We've gone over the slippery slope and the parachute is pulling out of the system as much as we can, spiritually, then mentally, then physically.
[01:57:06.451 --> 01:57:08.432]  And the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:57:08.852 --> 01:57:11.393]  Again, people should go read your articles at gab.com.
[01:57:11.453 --> 01:57:14.254]  Andrew Torma, where's the best place to find your excellent articles?
[01:57:16.175 --> 01:57:28.639]  Yeah, it's news.gab.com.
[01:57:28.659 --> 01:57:32.900]  That's our blog where all these articles can be found, and I've got some great responses on them.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.561]  People are really enjoying these reads, and they need to be shared with other people, too.
[01:57:36.581 --> 01:57:37.902]  These ideas need to be shared.
[01:57:37.922 --> 01:57:40.263]  I don't care if you give me credit or not.
[01:57:40.283 --> 01:57:43.764]  Just get these ideas out there, and we need more people talking about this stuff.
[01:57:44.688 --> 01:57:47.930]  We're already making a shirt that says, come and vax me instead of come and take it.
[01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:50.611]  But if you say, I'm going to put one out with that design right there.
[01:57:50.671 --> 01:57:54.713]  I love that where it says, can you guys put up the vaccine thing up again?
[01:57:54.733 --> 01:57:55.754]  That was really, really powerful.
[01:57:55.794 --> 01:57:58.135]  You guys just showed where it says, come and make me.
[01:57:58.195 --> 01:58:03.458]  I mean, this is so anti-human, so ridiculous, so over the top, so ridiculous.
[01:58:04.198 --> 01:58:05.499]  Andrew Torbo, thank you so much.
[01:58:06.659 --> 01:58:07.220]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:07.840]  Always a pleasure.
[01:58:08.356 --> 01:58:08.876]  There it is.
[01:58:09.037 --> 01:58:10.558]  What does a parallel society look like?
[01:58:10.638 --> 01:58:11.698]  I'm making a t-shirt out of this.
[01:58:11.738 --> 01:58:12.339]  He said use it.
[01:58:12.699 --> 01:58:13.420]  Come and make me.
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:19.284]  Let me say something to you during the break, Andrew, because I want to advertise with you guys to reach the most hardcore people that are on Gab.
[01:58:19.684 --> 01:58:20.425]  Very exciting.
[01:58:20.445 --> 01:58:21.646]  We want to see Gab explode.
[01:58:21.906 --> 01:58:23.447]  We want to see it be a million dollar company.
[01:58:23.467 --> 01:58:25.709]  We want to see the enemy defeated in the free market.
[01:58:25.749 --> 01:58:27.550]  That's why big tech is so scary.
[01:58:27.570 --> 01:58:28.050]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:29.008 --> 01:58:45.334]  The globalists hate Infowars because our analysis of their operations and their criminal activity and their stay-behind networks, trying to overthrow Trump and spy on him, were so deadly on target that if that gets to Congress or other people that are not that intelligent, it'll be over for the New World Order.
[01:58:46.701 --> 01:58:57.667]  They want Andrew Torba off because he's got the biggest, most successful system, Gab, that gets better and better under massive attack, because they don't want you having any communication when they carry out their globalist op.
[01:58:57.687 --> 01:59:00.908]  And they say that now in Congress, and they say that in the state of Texas.
[01:59:00.929 --> 01:59:07.172]  Oh, we're for free speech, but not Gab, because they allow people to say whatever they want as long as it's not violent.
[01:59:07.192 --> 01:59:07.992]  Well, that's freedom!
[01:59:09.693 --> 01:59:10.934]  And again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:12.042 --> 01:59:13.382]  Torba is at the center of this.
[01:59:13.402 --> 01:59:15.103]  I was about to say bye to him and cover a bunch of news.
[01:59:15.643 --> 01:59:16.523]  I said, how are you doing?
[01:59:16.543 --> 01:59:18.684]  He said, well, the German government's coming at us.
[01:59:18.744 --> 01:59:22.145]  I totally forgot the German government's trying to shut Gab down.
[01:59:22.645 --> 01:59:25.146]  So this is globalism, folks, with our free speech gone.
[01:59:25.166 --> 01:59:27.867]  It's not just big tech censoring us, it's foreign governments.
[01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:30.368]  So Andrew Torba from Gab.com, tell us about that.
[01:59:31.482 --> 01:59:34.284]  Yeah Alex, I wanted to stay for another segment because I forgot to bring this up.
[01:59:34.584 --> 01:59:37.306]  This is breaking news as of this afternoon actually.
[01:59:37.326 --> 01:59:45.172]  The German government has been coming at us for about a year now and trying to force us to comply with their draconian censorship laws.
[01:59:45.532 --> 01:59:55.960]  Now obviously we're not going to do that so now they're coming after us with these fines of tens of thousands of euros and other legal action and basically I've been talking to our lawyers this week
[01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:58.261]  And they said that we have more or less three options.
[01:59:58.321 --> 02:00:05.024]  We can obey German censorship laws and start censoring German content that the government doesn't like, which obviously we're not going to do.
[02:00:05.064 --> 02:00:05.965]  That's not going to happen.
[02:00:06.385 --> 02:00:14.109]  We can disobey German censorship and basically ignore this and try to pick a fight with an entire nation state, you know, as a small tech startup.
[02:00:14.649 --> 02:00:16.410]  I basically wouldn't be able to leave the U.S.
[02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.970]  ever again.
[02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:23.153]  They've come after us from every possible angle through state-sponsored de-platforming and really Lord knows what else.
[02:00:23.753 --> 02:00:27.415]  Or we could cease providing the service in Germany by blocking German IPs.
[02:00:27.435 --> 02:00:32.158]  And of course, many Germans are already using VPNs and other ways to access GAAB.
[02:00:32.198 --> 02:00:43.684]  So I think that is probably our best option at this point is to just block German IPs in order to be in compliance and get the entire nation-state of Germany off our back as this small tech startup here.
[02:00:43.804 --> 02:00:48.686]  Well, I have just seen an article a week ago where they mentioned you and others that the German state was looking at you.
[02:00:49.006 --> 02:00:51.808]  They're already fining you as this has already started and this is breaking.
[02:00:52.748 --> 02:00:54.530]  Yeah, yeah, they're coming after us hard, Alex.
[02:00:54.570 --> 02:01:01.098]  I mean, we got sent, uh, they sent, uh, a huge packet of all these laws and all this stuff that we're breaking.
[02:01:01.178 --> 02:01:03.321]  So, uh, you know, they're coming after us hard.
[02:01:03.361 --> 02:01:08.227]  And, you know, unfortunately we just, we don't have the resources to take on an entire nation state right now.
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:16.883]  So, you know, according to our lawyers, our best course of action right now is to block German IPs temporarily until we can figure a better solution out.
[02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:19.964]  But then it'll be your fault when they use other systems to get around it.
[02:01:20.404 --> 02:01:22.205]  This is the tyranny of world government.
[02:01:22.245 --> 02:01:23.185]  We're already living in it.
[02:01:23.205 --> 02:01:36.649]  For those that don't know, they go live on Facebook feeds and SWAT team doctors that tell people about vitamin C and vitamin D and they attack women with German Shepherds and police horses and blow their eyeballs out with high-powered water cannons.
[02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:38.010]  I mean, Germany is a
[02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:39.550]  Hellish place again.
[02:01:40.871 --> 02:01:42.131]  It's absolute madness.
[02:01:42.251 --> 02:01:46.993]  And you know, the fact that they're concerned about us, we have German users, certainly, but not that many.
[02:01:47.053 --> 02:01:48.273]  I mean, we're primarily a U.S.
[02:01:48.373 --> 02:01:50.254]  based English speaking website.
[02:01:50.674 --> 02:01:53.835]  So the fact that they're that focused on us is really something.
[02:01:53.855 --> 02:01:56.956]  It maybe tells me that we're more of a threat than we think that we are.
[02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:59.116]  Look how big you've gotten in Brazil.
[02:01:59.136 --> 02:02:00.837]  I mean, come on, you are exploding.
[02:02:01.177 --> 02:02:02.117]  They're scared of you.
[02:02:02.157 --> 02:02:02.957]  These are tyrants.
[02:02:03.378 --> 02:02:04.518]  Everybody should rally behind you.
[02:02:05.970 --> 02:02:16.321]  Yeah, it's unfortunate what's going on, but, you know, like I said at this time, we don't have the resources to take on an entire nation-state, so we have to do what we have to do, and I think that the Germans will figure out how to get around this, the German people.
[02:02:17.342 --> 02:02:26.652]  And, you know, it's just something that I wanted to be fully transparent with our community about, because under no circumstances are we going to, you know, start censoring on behalf of a foreign government.
[02:02:27.072 --> 02:02:33.274]  We have the foreign governments reach out all the time trying to get us to censor stuff and hand over user data and all this stuff.
[02:02:33.914 --> 02:02:38.355]  We tell them to get lost all the time, but now Germany is really starting to bring down the hammer.
[02:02:38.515 --> 02:02:39.655]  Let's talk about Australia.
[02:02:39.755 --> 02:02:44.837]  They've done a regulatory from the Crown Director General.
[02:02:45.905 --> 02:02:50.487]  So it shows that the legislature, the parliament's just puppet, just like Canada.
[02:02:50.707 --> 02:03:05.232]  People think they're free, but their governor general has come out and said, we're just going to read everybody's private texts and emails and social media without asking, and we'll pose as you and send out messages if we want saying, don't go to a demonstration.
[02:03:05.432 --> 02:03:09.073]  So they said, we'll take your identity too, and then five years in jail if we want.
[02:03:09.373 --> 02:03:14.115]  I mean, Australia is like the new North Korea, but with a Western civilization they're feeding on.
[02:03:14.395 --> 02:03:15.355]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:03:16.337 --> 02:03:23.741]  It's absolutely crazy and I think that we're going to start to see more and more of this, this Balkanization of the Internet and of the West in general.
[02:03:24.281 --> 02:03:31.425]  And unless, again, unless we start to break off and build right now, you know, we're not going to have anything.
[02:03:31.445 --> 02:03:32.445]  There's just going to be ash.
[02:03:32.525 --> 02:03:39.128]  So, you know, we need to start building our own parallel societies and, you know, our own parallel Internet and fighting back against this.
[02:03:39.188 --> 02:03:41.890]  It's the only way forward because it's just going to get worse and worse.
[02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:44.151]  You know, we've already given them over the past two years
[02:03:44.591 --> 02:04:00.906]  We've given them too much of our freedoms, we've given them too much of our liberty, and now they're getting bolder and bolder by the day, and they're pushing further and further, and it's just, it's not going to stop until, you know, they eliminate us all, or we're all in jail, or worse, so... That's right, this is real tyranny, and Andrew, in closing...
[02:04:02.025 --> 02:04:09.230]  People have to really let that sink in and understand that this is a global medical depopulation tyranny in their own words.
[02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:15.854]  And I think people now see that I wasn't exaggerating years ago that they really mean to implement every bit of what they've set up.
[02:04:16.234 --> 02:04:19.336]  And so that's why it's it's resist or die, isn't it?
[02:04:20.577 --> 02:04:21.318]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:04:21.378 --> 02:04:22.679]  Turn off the football game.
[02:04:22.699 --> 02:04:24.700]  You know, turn off the Netflix.
[02:04:25.579 --> 02:04:27.181]  Turn off the mainstream media news.
[02:04:27.441 --> 02:04:28.282]  Start building.
[02:04:28.382 --> 02:04:32.145]  Start caring about the future for your kids, the future for our country.
[02:04:32.686 --> 02:04:33.566]  Now is the time.
[02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:37.390]  Stop being distracted by the enemy's distractions and start building.
[02:04:37.670 --> 02:04:38.551]  That would be my message.
[02:04:39.844 --> 02:04:41.725]  General Milley, thank you so much, Andrew.
[02:04:41.745 --> 02:04:42.865]  Amazing job, gab.com.
[02:04:42.925 --> 02:04:44.406]  General Milley has put out a statement.
[02:04:44.426 --> 02:04:45.026]  I'll tell you about it.
[02:04:45.706 --> 02:04:51.048]  The next 15 minutes that Jay Dyer is going to be taking over, General Milley has come out with a statement.
[02:04:51.068 --> 02:04:51.509]  There it goes.
[02:04:51.649 --> 02:04:52.849]  Andrew Torbo, gab.com.
[02:04:53.229 --> 02:04:56.951]  Let me just say something here before I hit all this other news that's breaking and there's so much of my head spinning.
[02:04:59.012 --> 02:05:00.532]  Guys, print me the latest article.
[02:05:00.892 --> 02:05:02.053]  It's from Zero Hedge.
[02:05:02.093 --> 02:05:03.533]  He's come out and made a statement.
[02:05:03.713 --> 02:05:05.614]  We'll post it on InfoWars, ZeroHedge.com.
[02:05:06.514 --> 02:05:07.715]  Let me just explain something here.
[02:05:12.028 --> 02:05:13.593]  Let me explain why the globals are doing this.
[02:05:13.613 --> 02:05:17.045]  They're satanic, they're evil, they're jealous, they're into themselves, they're selfish.
[02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:27.030]  But they believe because of advanced technologies, we're going to reach an Atlantean moment, whether Atlantis existed or not, a new Atlantis moment where we blow ourselves up because of our technology.
[02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:30.692]  But then they're the ones proliferating all the dangerous stuff at the same time and destabilizing things.
[02:05:30.992 --> 02:05:31.973]  But that's their excuse.
[02:05:31.993 --> 02:05:33.534]  We've got to get rid of people to save the Earth.
[02:05:33.854 --> 02:05:39.998]  We've got to have a total tyranny, total surveillance of AI so that, you know, rogue states don't create a bioweapon that kills everybody.
[02:05:40.339 --> 02:05:44.341]  So we'll release a small bioweapon to train everybody to lock down during a crisis.
[02:05:44.361 --> 02:05:45.462]  This is all a global drill.
[02:05:45.762 --> 02:05:47.163]  You'll all be rewarded for carrying it out.
[02:05:47.243 --> 02:05:47.984]  That's what they told him.
[02:05:48.806 --> 02:05:54.249]  I've had people that served heads of state, Hillary Clinton, Merkel, you name it, on this show.
[02:05:54.810 --> 02:06:02.194]  I've had three-star generals on the show who said they're going to release a weapon and use it to lock stuff down and control society.
[02:06:02.494 --> 02:06:03.595]  And then it's in the documents.
[02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:06.592]  You gotta come to grips with this.
[02:06:07.092 --> 02:06:08.113]  See this cell phone right here?
[02:06:08.474 --> 02:06:09.535]  It tracks you, it controls you.
[02:06:09.575 --> 02:06:11.137]  I put it in a Faraday cage when I don't use it.
[02:06:11.157 --> 02:06:16.183]  And I've got the apps and all that stuff turned off, but it's still a very dangerous Trojan horse tool.
[02:06:16.243 --> 02:06:17.104]  It's a dangerous weapon.
[02:06:17.745 --> 02:06:24.353]  Like George Washington said, government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[02:06:25.848 --> 02:06:33.211]  But do you understand that the Apple iPhone, they estimate, has $200 billion of investment just in the development of it?
[02:06:33.231 --> 02:06:35.251]  It's a trillion plus dollar company.
[02:06:35.632 --> 02:06:38.412]  $200 billion just to do all this.
[02:06:38.433 --> 02:06:42.854]  So yeah, I could dial in if I had a Facebook or YouTube and go live and all this great technology.
[02:06:43.154 --> 02:06:44.955]  That's billions of dollars of research.
[02:06:45.575 --> 02:06:46.776]  We don't have all that.
[02:06:46.816 --> 02:06:49.678]  We've got to pay millions of dollars per quarter in bandwidth.
[02:06:50.038 --> 02:06:55.282]  We've got to pay millions to have our own systems and our own interfaces and our own encoders.
[02:06:55.843 --> 02:06:59.305]  And we're trying to build a bunch of that with money right now.
[02:06:59.565 --> 02:07:02.788]  And we've got a whole bunch of stuff constructed and almost ready.
[02:07:04.482 --> 02:07:11.026]  And like I said, I'd already have my house sold if the freeze didn't break the pipes and flood some of it, so that's getting fixed.
[02:07:11.106 --> 02:07:12.587]  I'm gonna take that money with pleasure.
[02:07:13.108 --> 02:07:19.592]  My goal is to have basically nothing, everything put into this place, everything expended in the fight.
[02:07:19.852 --> 02:07:21.934]  We got a bunch of other resistance going on.
[02:07:22.654 --> 02:07:24.055]  So I need you to help us.
[02:07:24.095 --> 02:07:25.576]  I need you to word of mouth, spread the word.
[02:07:25.596 --> 02:07:29.138]  I need you to support all the other great folks we've got by word of mouth, like Gab.
[02:07:29.499 --> 02:07:32.341]  And I need you for your own self to get products you need.
[02:07:32.661 --> 02:07:33.561]  Go to InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:07:34.562 --> 02:07:37.206]  You know, it's a great way to trigger leftists.
[02:07:37.406 --> 02:07:38.588]  And we've come up with a new t-shirt.
[02:07:38.969 --> 02:07:42.874]  We put it on screen for folks that says, I hate Alex Jones.
[02:07:43.495 --> 02:07:46.419]  And then on the back it says, don't visit InfoWars.com.
[02:07:47.369 --> 02:07:51.471]  And then there's our great Don't Tread on Me new design with the American flag and a rattlesnake.
[02:07:51.491 --> 02:07:52.672]  I think that's awesome as well.
[02:07:52.692 --> 02:07:58.055]  But we've got a new, if you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you can see it, the new Alex Jones.
[02:07:59.216 --> 02:08:00.196]  I hate Alex Jones.
[02:08:00.336 --> 02:08:05.019]  And then on the back, the same t-shirt says, Don't Visit InfoWars.com.
[02:08:05.059 --> 02:08:07.100]  It's a really good looking t-shirt.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.441]  I'm really, really proud of it.
[02:08:08.461 --> 02:08:09.542]  Now click the back for me, thanks.
[02:08:10.242 --> 02:08:11.642]  And I just hope everybody gets it.
[02:08:11.682 --> 02:08:21.025]  That way, you can be incognito, you can be around them, you can hear what they have to say, and they're so into themselves, they're going to actually believe it's real, but it's going to make them visit the website.
[02:08:21.386 --> 02:08:23.186]  Don't visit InfoWars.com.
[02:08:24.967 --> 02:08:26.467]  And I hate Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.527 --> 02:08:27.167]  It's a new shirt.
[02:08:27.227 --> 02:08:27.608]  Notice it's $9.95.
[02:08:27.668 --> 02:08:32.529]  The shirt cost us, because it's on good fabric and printed in America.
[02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:34.790]  We printed it in China, and it'll be $3.
[02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:35.690]  The shirt cost us about $7.
[02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:37.211]  After everything else, it cost us $9.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:39.540]  So, it's $9.95.
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:43.541]  All the shirts are at cost.
[02:08:44.202 --> 02:08:47.482]  Whatever they cost, it's a big t-shirt sale, including our new shirt.
[02:08:48.203 --> 02:08:49.243]  I hate Alex Jones.
[02:08:49.303 --> 02:08:49.543]  Get it.
[02:08:49.843 --> 02:08:51.143]  Oh, there's the new shirt I'm talking about, too.
[02:08:51.604 --> 02:08:53.944]  Come and take it with a big vaccine injector on it.
[02:08:54.344 --> 02:08:55.245]  And Trump won.
[02:08:55.725 --> 02:08:56.665]  And so much more.
[02:08:57.925 --> 02:09:01.926]  Eric Clapton bringing us in, almost killed by the Pfizer poison.
[02:09:01.946 --> 02:09:07.188]  And now he's getting censored online when he says we shouldn't be forced to take shots.
[02:09:08.237 --> 02:09:10.377]  Yep, all the tyranny goes hand in glove.
[02:09:11.958 --> 02:09:12.758]  We're going to fight back.
[02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:13.898]  We let the tyranny grow and grow.
[02:09:14.278 --> 02:09:15.398]  Now we start turning the corner.
[02:09:16.779 --> 02:09:19.899]  There's a lot of big breaking news right now, and I got more in the next segment.
[02:09:20.379 --> 02:09:22.220]  Biden urges climate action.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:23.980]  We don't have much more than 10 years.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.040]  Remember what AOC said two years ago.
[02:09:27.081 --> 02:09:28.141]  We have 12 years.
[02:09:28.161 --> 02:09:32.622]  2030, they're going to claim, oh, you're all dying because of global warming.
[02:09:32.682 --> 02:09:34.842]  It made superbugs that really came out of Wuhan.
[02:09:36.476 --> 02:09:49.768]  New York Times, President Biden warned today that the United States had only a decade left to confront a global climate crisis using his second day touring a wildfire-ravaged area.
[02:09:50.548 --> 02:09:51.089]  Here's another one.
[02:09:51.389 --> 02:09:55.593]  Biden to call on world leaders to commit to vaccinating 70% of the world.
[02:09:55.653 --> 02:10:02.279]  And once you do that, they go, actually it's 100%, actually it's boosters, actually it's 5 shots, it's 10 shots, actually it doesn't work, their immune system's gone!
[02:10:04.275 --> 02:10:06.456]  Devastating information.
[02:10:06.517 --> 02:10:07.177]  And now this.
[02:10:07.917 --> 02:10:08.298]  And listen.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:18.785]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but I do want to go on as a guest there because I'm told it's a popular show, but that's not really the big news.
[02:10:18.825 --> 02:10:19.585]  I'll talk about in a minute.
[02:10:21.963 --> 02:10:24.043]  Jim Hoft's got a syndicated show now.
[02:10:24.744 --> 02:10:25.704]  Breaking exclusive!
[02:10:26.124 --> 02:10:34.286]  Roger Stone served by Deep State while speaking on air with the Gateway Pundits, Joe Hoft, the brother of Jim Hoft.
[02:10:35.006 --> 02:10:36.126]  So they both, I guess, co-hosted.
[02:10:36.146 --> 02:10:38.606]  I love getting him on my show.
[02:10:39.487 --> 02:10:45.928]  Roger Stone was a guest this morning at Tomorrow's News Today with Joe Hoft and
[02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:49.214]  His other host, a St.
[02:10:49.234 --> 02:10:52.396]  Louis conservative talk show station, Real Talk 93.3.
[02:10:52.937 --> 02:10:56.840]  Stone was excellent, as usual, and sharp as he can be.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:05.047]  He discussed the many cases of abuse and injustices that he suffered as a result of the evil, corrupt agencies in Washington, D.C.
[02:11:05.107 --> 02:11:05.888]  during the Trump years.
[02:11:06.388 --> 02:11:11.873]  Stone shared about how he turned to Jesus, and it goes on from there, that he then got served during the show.
[02:11:14.172 --> 02:11:16.414]  The discussion was short, but here is what happened.
[02:11:16.514 --> 02:11:17.736]  Stone, hold on a second.
[02:11:18.176 --> 02:11:24.563]  I have a process server at my door about to serve me, at least it wasn't 50 SWAT team people, on my latest lawsuit.
[02:11:24.583 --> 02:11:26.905]  I'm going to take this live on your radio show.
[02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:32.951]  And then they brought it to him and they gave it to him for the Capitol saying he was behind the Capitol and launched that whole attack.
[02:11:33.231 --> 02:11:33.732]  But I love it.
[02:11:33.792 --> 02:11:37.456]  Tomorrow's news today, the InfoWars tagline.
[02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:40.930]  I think it just came to me five, six, seven years ago.
[02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:43.973]  I'm just like, you know, we're really tomorrow's news today.
[02:11:43.993 --> 02:11:45.234]  Cause we know what's going to break later.
[02:11:45.534 --> 02:11:46.655]  We know what's going to happen later.
[02:11:46.675 --> 02:11:48.096]  We know the whole globalist operation.
[02:11:48.156 --> 02:11:51.579]  So you really are getting tomorrow's news today.
[02:11:51.599 --> 02:11:55.442]  You're getting that vision, that research, that connection.
[02:11:55.482 --> 02:11:57.204]  And then I get really upset, man.
[02:11:57.264 --> 02:11:58.225]  I know all this stuff.
[02:11:58.285 --> 02:12:05.671]  I know in the rat studies, they made these same vaccines under other names for a decade and killed them and, and, and it caused blood clots.
[02:12:05.771 --> 02:12:06.912]  And we knew in heart attacks,
[02:12:08.078 --> 02:12:14.404]  And sterilization and cancer, and I'm just sitting here totally blown away every millisecond.
[02:12:14.705 --> 02:12:17.347]  I am just, this is all I think about now.
[02:12:17.567 --> 02:12:18.548]  This is all I dream about.
[02:12:18.568 --> 02:12:22.152]  You know, I used to have dreams about interesting things, boring things, wild things.
[02:12:22.212 --> 02:12:22.953]  Now I just dream about this.
[02:12:24.821 --> 02:12:39.551]  I'm at the office all day in my brain, when I'm awake, when I'm asleep, because it's just so incredible that we're just sitting here on air while they censor everybody and sue the Gateway Pundit and sue One American News and Newsmax and sue us, and they say the goal is to bankrupt us.
[02:12:39.932 --> 02:12:41.333]  Their goal is to close our doors.
[02:12:43.114 --> 02:12:43.935]  And you know that's what they say.
[02:12:43.975 --> 02:12:46.556]  They don't want judgments to try to get money from you.
[02:12:47.157 --> 02:12:47.997]  They don't want that.
[02:12:48.758 --> 02:12:49.979]  They want to shut you down.
[02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:51.750]  We're good to go.
[02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:16.736]  If you are supporting, and none of us are perfect, and it's hard to not do it sometimes, but you should go out of your way.
[02:13:17.037 --> 02:13:24.586]  I'll never forget, I was covering Bilderberg 11 years ago in north of London, and the cops came to see me with MI6 and MI5 to talk about what we were really planning.
[02:13:24.606 --> 02:13:25.848]  We had thousands showing up to rally.
[02:13:26.088 --> 02:13:28.691]  I met with them and, you know, they didn't even drink a Coca-Cola while I had dinner with them.
[02:13:29.372 --> 02:13:32.173]  The first time I got there and they said, you know, why are you staying in a big chain hotel?
[02:13:32.554 --> 02:13:33.914]  You say you're Mr. Anti-establishment.
[02:13:33.954 --> 02:13:34.875]  I would never spend my money.
[02:13:34.895 --> 02:13:36.656]  I used to be staying at a local inn or something.
[02:13:36.756 --> 02:13:37.336]  I said, you know what?
[02:13:37.356 --> 02:13:37.736]  You're right.
[02:13:38.116 --> 02:13:40.417]  In the future, I'll try to do that if it's able.
[02:13:40.758 --> 02:13:42.278]  It's just that simple.
[02:13:43.199 --> 02:13:44.359]  It's just that simple.
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:45.460]  All right.
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:46.800]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:13:48.341 --> 02:13:49.782]  Well, I got approached.
[02:13:51.483 --> 02:13:52.103]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:13:52.383 --> 02:13:53.404]  Probably a year ago now.
[02:13:54.738 --> 02:14:08.050]  Really just getting cranked up by a very well-known, successful, award-winning filmmaker who wanted to make a film with InfoWars about COVID-19 and where it was going.
[02:14:08.110 --> 02:14:12.475]  And part one was what they did, and they just finished it like a week ago, up until what's happened now.
[02:14:12.795 --> 02:14:13.536]  That's part one.
[02:14:14.537 --> 02:14:16.919]  They're making four other parts that will be done by early next year.
[02:14:17.299 --> 02:14:18.480]  Part two will be out in just a few months.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:26.845]  And it's a very high quality, very well done film that's designed to wake up sheeple and folks that don't know what's going on, but it's still very, very riveting.
[02:14:27.706 --> 02:14:31.789]  It's very important information, but it's done in like a PBS or 60 Minutes style.
[02:14:33.090 --> 02:14:34.811]  And it interviews a lot of amazing people.
[02:14:37.927 --> 02:14:38.167]  I don't know.
[02:14:56.849 --> 02:15:03.633]  And that's why after it comes out on DVD, it's going to be made available for free at Band.Video.
[02:15:04.454 --> 02:15:10.758]  So by buying a DVD, you get a hard copy that you have that you're going to be able to share with others and make copies of.
[02:15:10.778 --> 02:15:13.260]  It has a zero country code, meaning it works anywhere in the world.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.081]  And they want you to make copies.
[02:15:15.321 --> 02:15:16.142]  It's $19.95.
[02:15:16.962 --> 02:15:20.244]  And then you get a free copy of Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:15:20.324 --> 02:15:22.526]  I'm just throwing that in because I want you to get it.
[02:15:23.206 --> 02:15:28.148]  And so they are giving us part of the money that comes in and the rest goes to the filmmaker.
[02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:33.470]  The backer is just giving this money over to get it out.
[02:15:34.591 --> 02:15:38.793]  So understand that this is a desperate attempt to save humanity.
[02:15:40.053 --> 02:15:41.594]  And if this film goes viral,
[02:15:43.183 --> 02:15:48.327]  We'll put all five-part series up on Bandot Video, but they could take that down any day.
[02:15:48.367 --> 02:15:49.068]  They're attacking it.
[02:15:49.088 --> 02:15:49.888]  They're trying to hack it.
[02:15:49.928 --> 02:15:50.589]  They're suing us.
[02:15:51.249 --> 02:15:52.991]  And again, they've told us, we want to shut you down.
[02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:53.751]  We want to silence you.
[02:15:53.771 --> 02:15:54.352]  That's our goal.
[02:15:55.032 --> 02:15:56.854]  I mean, soon I'm going to talk about this.
[02:15:57.134 --> 02:15:58.395]  No one's ever seen anything like this.
[02:15:58.875 --> 02:16:00.476]  The level of stuff is just unprecedented.
[02:16:01.687 --> 02:16:07.374]  You need to have the DVD, just like you need to have Endgame, that predicted it all and shows their admissions, and now here we are.
[02:16:07.415 --> 02:16:08.676]  The two go together like a horse and carriage.
[02:16:09.117 --> 02:16:10.539]  Part One is a whole film.
[02:16:10.659 --> 02:16:12.361]  Lengthy, powerful, jam-packed.
[02:16:13.222 --> 02:16:14.324]  It's got everybody in it.
[02:16:15.211 --> 02:16:18.936]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, I mean myself.
[02:16:19.577 --> 02:16:22.120]  The list goes on and on.
[02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:23.922]  It's so professionally done.
[02:16:24.002 --> 02:16:26.185]  I'm so blessed to work with these people.
[02:16:26.806 --> 02:16:32.673]  So, everybody listening, you need to go get one copy for $19.95, get an additional free copy of Endgame.
[02:16:32.993 --> 02:16:34.015]  We're looking for global enslavement.
[02:16:35.563 --> 02:16:39.104]  And then for $9.95 more, you can also get an extra copy of it.
[02:16:39.664 --> 02:16:46.366]  So for $20.95, you get two copies of COVID Land Part One, the film, the miniseries, and then you get a free copy of In Game as well.
[02:16:46.786 --> 02:16:51.667]  So you have a copy for yourself and a copy to give to the library or church, but we want you to make copies.
[02:16:52.527 --> 02:17:00.569]  We want you to make copies, but we need to get the money back that it costs to make this so the filmmaker that donated his time and the crew get paid.
[02:17:00.849 --> 02:17:01.570]  They've not been paid.
[02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:03.110]  And again, they don't give a damn about money.
[02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:05.571]  They are totally committed.
[02:17:05.591 --> 02:17:08.114]  These folks have made some really big films that have been very, very successful.
[02:17:08.134 --> 02:17:12.118]  They're just donating to get this out because things are so serious.
[02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:16.002]  And so I really am counting on you to make sure their sacrifice goes all the way.
[02:17:16.022 --> 02:17:17.283]  I want you to order it.
[02:17:17.824 --> 02:17:19.025]  It ships in three weeks.
[02:17:19.465 --> 02:17:21.067]  It's been made right here in the USA.
[02:17:21.107 --> 02:17:21.968]  We've got the copies.
[02:17:23.049 --> 02:17:24.631]  There are only 18 wheeler coming here right now.
[02:17:26.032 --> 02:17:27.593]  But we've got the proof of it and all the rest of it.
[02:17:27.613 --> 02:17:28.173]  It's amazing.
[02:17:28.233 --> 02:17:29.734]  And then it's gonna start shipping in three weeks.
[02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:33.756]  Get your pre-orders in at covidland.com or infowarestore.com.
[02:17:33.776 --> 02:17:35.537]  We'll put it on the front page of infowarestore.com.
[02:17:35.957 --> 02:17:37.278]  covidland.com.
[02:17:37.318 --> 02:17:38.739]  Pre-order it today.
[02:17:38.879 --> 02:17:39.159]  And then...
[02:17:40.748 --> 02:17:53.079]  Hopefully they make their money back in the next three weeks, because then we're going to put it for free out on the internet for everybody, and I hope you'll at least share it, because, man, the new lockdowns are coming, and the only way to stop this is you taking action.
[02:17:53.099 --> 02:18:03.829]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and these filmmakers and the producer has really, really done a great job for InfoWars and have been huge supporters, and so they're a godsend.
[02:18:05.646 --> 02:18:08.227]  And I'm just hoping that God continues to send blessings like this.
[02:18:08.247 --> 02:18:09.908]  So thank you so much to the makers of this.
[02:18:09.968 --> 02:18:13.510]  But it's the first InfoWars official documentary production in nine years.
[02:18:14.071 --> 02:18:20.834]  We teamed up with Paul Wittenberg from Framing the World Productions to produce a five-part documentary series, COVIDland.
[02:18:21.194 --> 02:18:22.035]  I voice it as well.
[02:18:22.575 --> 02:18:34.662]  Episode one is called The Lockdown, The Chronicles, The Early Days of COVID-19 Pandemic, and shows how big tech, MSM, and governments deceive the world into accepting lockdowns, use fraudulent cases, inflated death numbers, and fake news to take over.
[02:18:35.562 --> 02:18:47.007]  You can pre-order COVIDLAND, the lockdown, on high-quality DVD at inforestore.com or covidland.com for just $19.95, and each order comes with a free copy of INGAME BLUEPRINT for global enslavement.
[02:18:47.507 --> 02:18:54.610]  Now the criminal elites are gearing up for lockdown too, and the only way to stop them is by getting a physical copy of the DVD and making copies and getting it out.
[02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:55.371]  Show it!
[02:18:55.471 --> 02:18:56.511]  I mean, it's free to air.
[02:18:56.551 --> 02:18:57.452]  Show it on a local TV station.
[02:18:57.472 --> 02:18:58.032]  Pay them to play it.
[02:18:58.232 --> 02:18:58.792]  Put it on AXS.
[02:18:58.832 --> 02:18:59.673]  Just fight back, folks.
[02:19:01.174 --> 02:19:02.336]  Rent out theaters and show it.
[02:19:02.777 --> 02:19:07.645]  It has a zero country code so it will play anywhere and you can make your own copies.
[02:19:08.005 --> 02:19:14.476]  For educational purposes and share with your local election officials, friends and neighbors and thought leaders.
[02:19:15.441 --> 02:19:17.403]  This is an info war becoming a physical war.
[02:19:17.464 --> 02:19:20.467]  We've got to win in the info war before the globalist trigger the physical war.
[02:19:20.748 --> 02:19:21.989]  We must stop lockdown too.
[02:19:22.029 --> 02:19:24.272]  Get the DVD and get it out to everyone you know.
[02:19:24.733 --> 02:19:28.457]  Because the filmmaking team really wants you to get the DVD and share it.
[02:19:28.958 --> 02:19:32.402]  If you order a second copy of Covid Land for only $9.95, you get an extra copy.
[02:19:33.343 --> 02:19:35.545]  Uh, of a second copy of Endgame.
[02:19:36.025 --> 02:19:39.988]  And that's an interesting typo that they just lost in translation when we were coming up with the deal.
[02:19:40.008 --> 02:19:40.468]  That's fine.
[02:19:40.528 --> 02:19:41.349]  Cost me an extra dollar.
[02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.809]  I'll do it.
[02:19:41.869 --> 02:19:42.290]  I don't care.
[02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:45.812]  Yes, you get two copies of Endgame when you get an extra copy of Covenant Land.
[02:19:45.852 --> 02:19:46.113]  Sure.
[02:19:46.133 --> 02:19:48.774]  Uh, all I care about is getting it out.
[02:19:48.815 --> 02:19:51.536]  So get two of the film and get two copies of Endgame free.
[02:19:52.017 --> 02:19:53.398]  And get the other copy of the film for $9.95.
[02:19:53.438 --> 02:19:54.098]  For $29.95, you get four DVDs.
[02:19:58.491 --> 02:20:01.413]  1995, one copy of COVIDLAND DVD, free in-game DVD.
[02:20:01.433 --> 02:20:05.374]  2995, two copies of COVIDLAND, two free in-game DVDs.
[02:20:05.454 --> 02:20:09.196]  Go to covidland.com and help stop Lockdown 2.
[02:20:09.236 --> 02:20:12.637]  I mean, this is it, folks.
[02:20:12.717 --> 02:20:13.738]  This is the big fight.
[02:20:13.778 --> 02:20:15.719]  And please support our local AM and FM stations.
[02:20:16.259 --> 02:20:17.559]  Please support them and spread the word.
[02:20:17.579 --> 02:20:19.880]  The globalists are trying to shut down the real economy.
[02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:22.782]  They're trying to bankrupt the Christian economy, the American economy.
[02:20:23.062 --> 02:20:24.782]  We are at war with the Great Reset.
[02:20:24.822 --> 02:20:26.003]  We've been declared non-essential.
[02:20:27.765 --> 02:20:29.567]  And I told you I'm not laying down.
[02:20:29.607 --> 02:20:32.850]  I've been busy doing four or five hours a radio day running these operations.
[02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:34.091]  I haven't made a film in nine years.
[02:20:34.171 --> 02:20:36.493]  I got heavily involved in this and spent a lot of time on it.
[02:20:36.853 --> 02:20:39.996]  And we're now almost done with part two.
[02:20:40.376 --> 02:20:41.677]  It's going to go into production in a few weeks.
[02:20:41.717 --> 02:20:47.482]  So it'll come out like one comes out and then about a month another comes out and then about a month and a half later another comes out.
[02:20:47.683 --> 02:20:48.824]  But then we've got to get those done.
[02:20:49.264 --> 02:20:55.789]  They've got the basic film stuff almost done, but they're adding new information as it goes up to the line so people get this data and this intel.
[02:20:56.069 --> 02:20:57.550]  And people can watch CNN all day.
[02:20:57.890 --> 02:20:59.912]  Once they see the truth, once it unlocks their mind.
[02:21:00.012 --> 02:21:06.677]  So, Loose Change, Endgame, my other films that I produced and made and directed exploded.
[02:21:07.818 --> 02:21:08.118]  Okay?
[02:21:08.738 --> 02:21:14.723]  So, that's up to you, ladies and gentlemen, to get out to everyone you know and to share.
[02:21:16.328 --> 02:21:17.769]  Because it's going to affect the world.
[02:21:17.789 --> 02:21:20.230]  You know, people didn't want to touch DVDs six, seven years ago.
[02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:22.051]  The newest thing was Netflix and all the computers.
[02:21:22.311 --> 02:21:23.572]  Now everybody has a nostalgia.
[02:21:23.592 --> 02:21:24.312]  DVDs are coming back.
[02:21:24.593 --> 02:21:25.493]  The stuff disappears.
[02:21:25.533 --> 02:21:26.313]  Stuff gets re-edited.
[02:21:26.333 --> 02:21:26.994]  Stuff gets destroyed.
[02:21:27.394 --> 02:21:28.635]  So get the film.
[02:21:28.795 --> 02:21:29.615]  Burn copies.
[02:21:29.695 --> 02:21:30.636]  Put it on your hard drive.
[02:21:30.976 --> 02:21:31.776]  Share it everywhere.
[02:21:31.836 --> 02:21:32.717]  Take clips out of it.
[02:21:32.917 --> 02:21:33.457]  Re-edit it.
[02:21:34.018 --> 02:21:34.658]  Do whatever you want.
[02:21:34.718 --> 02:21:38.560]  I'll stand on my head and light my hair on fire if you'll just fight the globalists.
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:40.241]  It's only going to get worse.
[02:21:40.561 --> 02:21:41.622]  This is life and death.
[02:21:43.462 --> 02:21:44.943]  Now people get why I'm so upset.
[02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:49.725]  You know how many people I know in Austin whose children, girls and boys have died after taking these damn shots?
[02:21:50.266 --> 02:21:52.587]  I know five people whose children have died of heart attacks.
[02:21:52.867 --> 02:21:53.507]  Healthy children!
[02:21:55.308 --> 02:21:56.129]  Now they're coming for the under-12s.
[02:21:56.149 --> 02:21:57.510]  Are we going to just roll over to this?
[02:21:57.530 --> 02:21:58.670]  Or are we going to fight back?
[02:21:59.591 --> 02:22:04.573]  Get COVID Land Part 1 The Lockdown for $19.95 with a free copy of Endgame now!
[02:22:05.174 --> 02:22:05.414]  Get it!
[02:22:06.127 --> 02:22:09.752]  And down the road, hopefully they'll do some deals where you get like 10 copies for 20 bucks or something.
[02:22:09.772 --> 02:22:17.362]  But right now, they need to make their money back because he needs to pay for all the flights and all the hotels and all the people for the filmmaker.
[02:22:18.556 --> 02:22:19.097]  And the crew.
[02:22:19.157 --> 02:22:21.939]  So infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:23.661]  Do not wait.
[02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:24.341]  Take action.
[02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:25.182]  God bless you all.
[02:22:25.202 --> 02:22:26.543]  All right, Jay Dyer is amazing.
[02:22:27.104 --> 02:22:29.986]  He knows even more than I do about the latest globalist reset in their books.
[02:22:30.006 --> 02:22:30.827]  He's read hundreds of them.
[02:22:31.247 --> 02:22:35.911]  I've gotten to where I don't even read the new ones, even though I learn stuff when I do, because it just pisses me off so bad.
[02:22:35.972 --> 02:22:42.998]  But actually, I do read constantly, but he reads even more than I do, and he'll tell you how they're point blank coming for you and your family, and the attack is now.
[02:22:43.438 --> 02:22:44.879]  And then coming up in 45 minutes,
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:49.123]  Owen Troyer and The War Room, kicking butt.
[02:22:49.463 --> 02:22:50.664]  Great guests, great calls.
[02:22:51.145 --> 02:22:52.486]  Owen is just doing a great job.
[02:22:52.986 --> 02:22:55.768]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:22:56.049 --> 02:22:56.549]  Banned out video.
[02:22:56.569 --> 02:22:58.270]  I don't want to keep coming to you and say we got to fight.
[02:22:58.611 --> 02:23:00.372]  We got to fight because it's a war.
[02:23:00.732 --> 02:23:04.115]  Not like on a football game where you cheer your team and maybe it helps them.
[02:23:04.215 --> 02:23:05.236]  You are under attack.
[02:23:05.496 --> 02:23:06.377]  You are on the field.
[02:23:06.417 --> 02:23:09.740]  You are in a death battle against the New World Order.
[02:23:11.027 --> 02:23:15.970]  Even those of you that pose like you're part of the system and laugh this off because you're delusional, you're being targeted as well.
[02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:16.690]  You will pay.
[02:23:17.691 --> 02:23:18.712]  You will be killed.
[02:23:19.332 --> 02:23:22.714]  The globalists will implant you with cancer and you will die just like your father.
[02:23:22.734 --> 02:23:23.995]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:24.015 --> 02:23:24.435]  Stay with us.
[02:23:25.936 --> 02:23:27.697]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:27.817 --> 02:23:30.539]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[02:23:31.562 --> 02:23:40.246]  You know, it's a really lame thing to spend years building your own alternative media platform, profile, work, content.
[02:23:40.606 --> 02:23:41.767]  I had it happen to me.
[02:23:41.967 --> 02:23:43.507]  And you get deplatformed, right?
[02:23:43.568 --> 02:23:44.828]  You build an audience.
[02:23:45.508 --> 02:23:48.330]  And really, a lot of these tech companies, they relied on the
[02:23:49.310 --> 02:23:54.191]  Creativity in the power of the people their audience that bring everybody on as a bridge.
[02:23:54.832 --> 02:24:09.976]  And then once they build the platform everybody's there then they screw over the people and demonetize them the platform and so forth that's happened to me i've lost my website in the past i've lost monetization on youtube and we've also had people on as guests who are.
[02:24:10.616 --> 02:24:18.900]  In the sphere of entertainment comedy, we've had Sam Tripoli, we've had Sam Hyde, and now we've got one of the guys from the skating world.
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:21.522]  If you don't know, the skateboarding world has blowed up.
[02:24:21.802 --> 02:24:23.062]  It's gotten crazy, right?
[02:24:23.122 --> 02:24:24.783]  It's now, it's a popular thing.
[02:24:25.304 --> 02:24:30.746]  Used to be a nerdy thing, and so we're gonna talk to a blacklisted and censored skater.
[02:24:30.766 --> 02:24:32.467]  His name is Wecking Ball.
[02:24:33.828 --> 02:24:34.728]  And he's also a funny guy.
[02:24:34.748 --> 02:24:36.609]  He's not just a skater, he has many talents.
[02:24:36.629 --> 02:24:37.710]  He's a renaissance man.
[02:24:39.036 --> 02:24:45.320]  And he is a content creator on Patreon.
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:47.301]  And I want to talk to him.
[02:24:47.321 --> 02:24:48.121]  Is he there?
[02:24:48.261 --> 02:24:48.982]  Are you there, Weck?
[02:24:50.783 --> 02:24:51.283]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:51.343 --> 02:24:52.624]  I'm here, Mr. Jay Dyer.
[02:24:53.897 --> 02:24:54.537]  What's up, man?
[02:24:54.577 --> 02:25:01.320]  Hey, tell us a little bit about yourself first before we get into what happened to you and the bad experiences that you've had.
[02:25:01.901 --> 02:25:03.962]  How did you get into the world of skating?
[02:25:04.082 --> 02:25:07.763]  And then what did you do to build your own audience and your own kind of career?
[02:25:08.284 --> 02:25:12.586]  And then tell us more about what a pro skater is versus somebody who's not.
[02:25:12.626 --> 02:25:17.468]  How that ties into the corporate scam of the skateboarding world and where all that's going.
[02:25:19.815 --> 02:25:20.135]  Surely.
[02:25:20.516 --> 02:25:29.782]  First, Jay, I just want to thank you for having me on the American Far-Right Conspiracy Theory and Fake News website owned by Alex Jones.
[02:25:30.903 --> 02:25:31.924]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[02:25:31.944 --> 02:25:39.390]  Yeah, so how I got into skateboarding, is that what you were firstly asking, sir?
[02:25:41.711 --> 02:25:41.951]  Yes.
[02:25:41.971 --> 02:25:43.693]  A little bit about you first.
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:48.584]  Yes, so I got into skateboarding at a very young age.
[02:25:49.304 --> 02:25:56.532]  I like doing athletic things and I did a lot of team sports growing up but they just weren't for me.
[02:25:56.572 --> 02:26:03.539]  I didn't really like the idea of possibly losing because somebody else on the team did not perform well.
[02:26:03.879 --> 02:26:05.440]  I liked skateboarding because it was
[02:26:06.565 --> 02:26:10.406]  Something that I could do just by myself with very little equipment.
[02:26:12.246 --> 02:26:18.408]  And it was also something that it was a very creative way to be athletic.
[02:26:18.448 --> 02:26:21.648]  You, you, you learn and you can even create your own tricks.
[02:26:22.288 --> 02:26:28.310]  So for me, growing up as a young kid, that was how I got into it.
[02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:34.291]  And I also liked the aspect of it that it was kind of like
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:38.962]  In an underground kind of status back then.
[02:26:39.062 --> 02:26:40.643]  It was a subculture, right?
[02:26:40.703 --> 02:26:43.965]  It was a counterculture subculture, right?
[02:26:44.225 --> 02:26:44.686]  Yeah.
[02:26:44.746 --> 02:26:46.187]  This is in like the late 90s.
[02:26:46.787 --> 02:26:57.713]  So back then, you know, if you told somebody you skateboard, they probably would just think you rode the skateboard down the street to the store or something like that.
[02:26:57.753 --> 02:27:00.295]  But you're like, I didn't really understand it.
[02:27:01.770 --> 02:27:02.751]  Right, that's what I do now.
[02:27:02.951 --> 02:27:04.612]  I used to skate to the street.
[02:27:04.652 --> 02:27:06.233]  Now you're a pro Segway man.
[02:27:07.955 --> 02:27:12.058]  Exactly, because I'm just trying to fight carbon and everything.
[02:27:12.998 --> 02:27:20.864]  I put my Hemi truck on pause for now and I ride my electric Segway to the store so I can get my soy milk.
[02:27:21.845 --> 02:27:23.046]  You're a good global citizen, right?
[02:27:24.107 --> 02:27:24.467]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:27.088 --> 02:27:28.109]  All right, so tell us about that.
[02:27:28.129 --> 02:27:42.661]  So then you're into skating, you start to build an audience, and you kind of got, right, to where you're basically at the skill level of pro, but as you explained to me, pro skateboarding now is kind of like tied into corporate deals, right?
[02:27:42.701 --> 02:27:49.507]  And this is where we get into the bad news because now they're socially engineering every niche, every subculture.
[02:27:51.365 --> 02:27:51.885]  That's right.
[02:27:52.425 --> 02:28:02.808]  So I actually built my fan base around my comedy and for lack of better words, maybe trolling on social media.
[02:28:04.168 --> 02:28:15.571]  But the phrase pro skater to, you know, everybody that is a pro skater by definition or the industry would be that you are recognized
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:22.943]  And by a corporate brand, and they are acknowledging that you're worthy to be paid and be on their team.
[02:28:24.084 --> 02:28:34.249]  But, you know, so that kind of eliminates any room for someone doing professional skating independently, which is what I do.
[02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:38.471]  And, you know, it's very tough.
[02:28:38.511 --> 02:28:40.792]  A lot of people don't really agree that I'm
[02:28:41.554 --> 02:28:44.955]  You know, quote-unquote a professional skateboarder, but I do sell skateboards.
[02:28:45.436 --> 02:28:49.777]  So I'm getting paid to skateboard, which is the definition of being a professional.
[02:28:50.998 --> 02:29:01.282]  Well, does that play more into maybe the fact that you've trolled a lot of people, that you've done a lot of, you know, I guess you could say counterculture type of content, right?
[02:29:01.322 --> 02:29:04.143]  I mean, you've had some problems with censorship, right?
[02:29:06.338 --> 02:29:24.763]  Absolutely, and I think that maybe part of the reason that these guys don't really, you know, want me to be acknowledged as being someone that can have an audience in skateboarding is because I didn't take the path that they did and, you know, climb up the ladder of these corporate brands and, you know, pay their dues.
[02:29:25.303 --> 02:29:26.703]  I kind of, I just did it on my own.
[02:29:27.464 --> 02:29:32.525]  So they really don't want to acknowledge, you know, what I have, that I deserve it.
[02:29:34.756 --> 02:29:36.998]  But, I mean, you weren't, like, supremely political, right?
[02:29:37.038 --> 02:29:40.720]  I mean, you weren't doing, like, a lot of political, you know, skateboarding content.
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.481]  It was just the humor, right?
[02:29:42.501 --> 02:29:44.543]  They went after the satire and the comedy, right?
[02:29:45.924 --> 02:29:46.244]  Right.
[02:29:46.264 --> 02:29:48.185]  Yeah, I still am not political.
[02:29:48.505 --> 02:29:54.249]  I mean, sometimes I'll take, you know, stabs at, uh, you know, the NSA or something like that.
[02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:58.332]  But nobody really knows what my political thoughts are.
[02:29:58.352 --> 02:29:59.533]  I don't really get into that.
[02:29:59.553 --> 02:30:01.854]  It's kind of just my comedy is
[02:30:03.514 --> 02:30:12.918]  As far as the skateboarding related things go, I just poke fun at things that are just goofy and they're forced.
[02:30:12.938 --> 02:30:15.520]  Like cringe, I'm sure you know about that.
[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:18.541]  I'm an expert at cringe, absolutely.
[02:30:18.621 --> 02:30:20.402]  I'm really skilled with cringe, so yes.
[02:30:22.163 --> 02:30:22.743]  Me too.
[02:30:22.863 --> 02:30:23.883]  I embrace the cringe.
[02:30:23.983 --> 02:30:31.427]  Sometimes I make fun of myself, which is, you know, I don't see how they could get mad when I'm the butt of the joke sometimes.
[02:30:32.409 --> 02:30:32.689]  Right.
[02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:35.591]  So, uh, what happened in terms of the censorship?
[02:30:35.631 --> 02:30:36.832]  Can you give some examples?
[02:30:36.872 --> 02:30:38.954]  Like I know you collab with Sam Hyde.
[02:30:38.994 --> 02:30:43.037]  Was it as a result of that or were you starting to get heat prior to that?
[02:30:44.999 --> 02:30:46.400]  Uh, no, I can't.
[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:57.048]  I always, as soon as my, my fan base was being built, I already was done with, because what happened was there was guys that are in the skateboarding industry that just know everyone.
[02:30:57.308 --> 02:31:01.211]  And they made some phone calls and they said, you know, don't put this guy on your team.
[02:31:02.094 --> 02:31:02.935]  Oh wow.
[02:31:03.615 --> 02:31:08.039]  Yeah, so that kind of forced me into doing it myself anyway.
[02:31:08.059 --> 02:31:19.308]  And looking back at that now, I'm glad it went that way because the way that things have spawned now in the skateboarding industry, and like you said, it was a counterculture, now that's been replaced with cancel culture.
[02:31:19.908 --> 02:31:23.992]  And the entire skateboarding industry now, and the community,
[02:31:25.092 --> 02:31:33.197]  They're just repeating Lib Turd stuff and it's just totally just some SJW thing now that they're on with.
[02:31:33.257 --> 02:31:48.546]  So I'm glad that I'm not affiliated with any of those corporate brands like Nike or Supreme or anything and they're not paying me because when they're giving you a check, they can tell you what to do and they can pretty much make your own ideas for you.
[02:31:48.586 --> 02:31:50.787]  You've got to agree with them or they'll just cut you.
[02:31:52.145 --> 02:31:52.345]  Right.
[02:31:52.385 --> 02:31:52.786]  Exactly.
[02:31:52.826 --> 02:31:53.066]  All right.
[02:31:53.086 --> 02:31:54.588]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:54.668 --> 02:32:00.955]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, and we're talking to canceled skateboarder Wacking Ball.
[02:32:01.015 --> 02:32:01.696]  So stay right there.
[02:32:01.736 --> 02:32:02.817]  We'll be right back in just a second.
[02:32:02.977 --> 02:32:04.639]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:04.699 --> 02:32:06.822]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:32:06.842 --> 02:32:07.863]  We were just talking about
[02:32:08.695 --> 02:32:16.138]  The way subcultures and counterculture groups and niches are actually exploited and are steered or created.
[02:32:16.198 --> 02:32:30.124]  In fact, if you follow my work, you know that I've covered the 1960s counterculture movements that were basically created and or steered by the CIA into becoming a social engineering tool of the big corporate elite.
[02:32:30.144 --> 02:32:33.125]  We see that especially nowadays through pop culture.
[02:32:33.145 --> 02:32:35.166]  When we look at the music videos, we look at
[02:32:35.866 --> 02:32:36.807]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:32:51.890 --> 02:32:53.411]  We saw it with Obamacare, right?
[02:32:53.431 --> 02:33:00.573]  They were promoting Obamacare at the Super Bowl years ago, and then it turned into the Halftime Show being this big, basically, satanic ritual.
[02:33:01.233 --> 02:33:11.276]  And in the other sub-niches and cultures that have exploded and gotten tremendously popular, like skateboarding, we've seen the same type of steering and subversion.
[02:33:11.296 --> 02:33:19.679]  I have another friend who is a prominent comic book artist, and he's basically been squeezed out because the world of comic books is so
[02:33:20.739 --> 02:33:30.567]  Dogmatic with their, it's basically a holy office of inquisition that they have when it comes to how comic books can be drawn, how they can be written.
[02:33:30.587 --> 02:33:35.211]  You have all of these, you know, you can't do fat shaming or any of this kind of stuff.
[02:33:35.731 --> 02:33:40.815]  It controls the realm of comics and it's no different in the other domains like skateboarding.
[02:33:41.476 --> 02:33:46.520]  And we have, you know, again, prominent skateboarder Wrecking Ball with us.
[02:33:47.225 --> 02:33:56.785]  Who built his own audience built his own fan base and from the outset because he wasn't signed on to the corporate establishment the corporate deals and he was trolling.
[02:33:57.555 --> 02:34:03.438]  And the humor isn't really excessively, you know, gross or offensive or anything like that.
[02:34:03.498 --> 02:34:05.499]  He just likes to troll people, likes to have fun.
[02:34:06.159 --> 02:34:07.560]  I think he's a really funny guy.
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.262]  And, you know, he got basically blacklisted.
[02:34:11.322 --> 02:34:15.324]  And so that's what they do, is that if you don't go along, you get blacklisted.
[02:34:15.364 --> 02:34:17.104]  And it's really the same in every domain.
[02:34:17.164 --> 02:34:19.746]  I was in the domain of academia.
[02:34:19.806 --> 02:34:20.886]  I wanted to be a professor.
[02:34:21.306 --> 02:34:22.587]  You basically get blacklisted.
[02:34:22.627 --> 02:34:26.649]  If you study, you know, how geopolitics works, if you study the elite, you study
[02:34:27.566 --> 02:34:30.948]  You know, Carol Quigley, this kind of stuff, you get pushed out.
[02:34:30.988 --> 02:34:33.289]  You're not welcome in the domain of academia.
[02:34:33.729 --> 02:34:35.329]  And so let's go back to Wacking Ball.
[02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:44.874]  I want to ask you, you were getting into that, how that censorship worked, where you're kind of pushed out, and you know, you didn't get these deals and whatnot, yet you still, you know, were able to do what you were doing.
[02:34:44.894 --> 02:34:48.035]  Who began the tech censorship with you?
[02:34:48.055 --> 02:34:49.796]  Because I noticed like three, four years ago,
[02:34:50.356 --> 02:34:53.538]  There's, you know, interviews with you on YouTube with millions of views.
[02:34:53.818 --> 02:35:01.103]  You're on some of the top, you know, podcasts, skateboarding podcasts, millions of views, and then what you got deleted from YouTube, right?
[02:35:03.442 --> 02:35:04.763]  I didn't get deleted from YouTube.
[02:35:04.823 --> 02:35:05.983]  I got demonetized.
[02:35:06.543 --> 02:35:22.951]  And their explanation for that was that I used, because I had my account on monetized settings, and they said that I was demonetized because I was using footage that I did not own, although it was just footage of me that I filmed.
[02:35:23.071 --> 02:35:27.133]  So I think they just made that up because they didn't want to say what I really did wrong.
[02:35:27.973 --> 02:35:32.255]  So the tech censorship
[02:35:32.972 --> 02:35:35.613]  That I've been, uh, and I'm not a victim.
[02:35:36.093 --> 02:35:38.595]  I don't want to, I'm not trying to come across like I'm a victim.
[02:35:38.635 --> 02:35:39.255]  I'm a victor.
[02:35:39.375 --> 02:35:40.475]  I overcome this stuff.
[02:35:41.096 --> 02:35:44.457]  So, uh, but that's on Instagram mostly.
[02:35:44.477 --> 02:35:45.598]  I mean, I'm shadow banned.
[02:35:45.638 --> 02:35:46.378]  I'm restricted.
[02:35:46.398 --> 02:35:48.499]  I have over a hundred thousand followers.
[02:35:48.719 --> 02:35:53.561]  And, uh, I, you know, I used to do live videos, like 500 to a thousand people would come on there.
[02:35:53.601 --> 02:35:54.802]  Now there's like 50 people.
[02:35:54.822 --> 02:35:59.524]  So they're not even letting people know that follow like people, you know, select to follow me.
[02:36:00.104 --> 02:36:06.626]  You would think that they're going to get notified of when you make a post, but they've got me heavily restricted on there.
[02:36:07.146 --> 02:36:15.788]  So, I mean, I think maybe the reason they do that is so that it's not so obvious and I start kicking off about, you know, how I'm being, you know, banned or whatever.
[02:36:16.608 --> 02:36:20.309]  But, yeah, it's just a little game they're playing with me, I guess.
[02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:32.751]  But you saw this, you know, when you and I talked a couple weeks ago, and you've got a podcast, by the way, I recommend people watch your podcast over on your Patreon if they want to support your work.
[02:36:34.331 --> 02:36:43.176]  We were talking about the way that these corporations kind of control, and then they start slipping in the messages, right?
[02:36:43.216 --> 02:36:48.218]  So it might begin with buying off the big skaters, but then the big skaters are expected to go along with
[02:36:49.079 --> 02:36:49.299]  Right.
[02:37:07.628 --> 02:37:26.404]  Yes, and that's actually, for anybody watching, that's how you and I met, was I did a parody of the Alex Jones Show, but it was called InfoBoards, and I did a breakdown of the satanic imagery in skateboarding, and we had you on as our expert to decode these symbols.
[02:37:27.371 --> 02:37:37.199]  So I first noticed that, and I'm sure even if people don't know skateboarding all that well, and to those who are watching who might be saying, why do I care about skateboarding?
[02:37:37.319 --> 02:37:38.080]  I don't skateboard.
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:39.281]  I don't know anyone that skateboards.
[02:37:39.841 --> 02:37:50.870]  The point is that they're trying to cover every single aspect of life and every community, every subculture, that there's no room left to get away from this agenda.
[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:51.831]  You know what I mean?
[02:37:51.871 --> 02:37:55.594]  So it's something as niche as skateboarding, they're in there.
[02:37:56.132 --> 02:38:00.615]  So anyway, I firstly noticed... Oh, that's the old one.
[02:38:00.955 --> 02:38:02.536]  That was the first one I did.
[02:38:02.596 --> 02:38:04.157]  I did two episodes of that.
[02:38:04.197 --> 02:38:07.359]  My Alex costume got a little bit better on the next one, but...
[02:38:08.197 --> 02:38:19.248]  So the first time I noticed the satanic imagery was, of course, with Thrasher Magazine, which people probably have seen that logo that don't skateboard.
[02:38:20.209 --> 02:38:31.501]  I'm sure they've seen celebrities wearing shirts of it or something like that, but it's literally a bafflement with a pentagram on it, and all they did was just put skateboard wheels on the end of the pentagram.
[02:38:32.222 --> 02:38:33.843]  So that was the first time I noticed that.
[02:38:33.943 --> 02:38:41.765]  And then, you know, a lot of those brands, they've been running for years, like the All-Seeing Eye and everything like that.
[02:38:41.785 --> 02:38:47.907]  And so it's like very heavy in the skateboarding fashion, which also transcends skateboarding.
[02:38:48.347 --> 02:38:50.088]  A lot of people wear skateboarding clothes.
[02:38:50.868 --> 02:38:53.969]  So many people wear skateboarding shoes that don't skateboard.
[02:38:54.529 --> 02:38:57.570]  Chances are, if somebody has tennis shoes today, they're skateboarding shoes.
[02:38:59.051 --> 02:39:09.057]  Yeah, it's kind of like in the past decade, a lot of style and fashion that was popular in the punk genre kind of spilled over into the mainstream.
[02:39:09.077 --> 02:39:10.218]  So they kind of mainstreamed
[02:39:10.902 --> 02:39:11.662]  Punk stuff.
[02:39:11.682 --> 02:39:17.445]  I mean, everybody having like purple social justice warrior haircuts is actually out of the punk world.
[02:39:17.525 --> 02:39:26.608]  I mean, so and then you have a kind of a similar influence where things from the skateboarding world kind of spill over into the mainstream culture like you're talking about.
[02:39:27.188 --> 02:39:36.572]  And it was right around the same time, though, that I remember like five, six, even 10 years ago, you would start to see mainline fashion beginning to really adopt that imagery.
[02:39:36.792 --> 02:39:39.313]  You would go into just normal department stores and you would see
[02:39:39.973 --> 02:39:40.173]  We're good.
[02:39:57.032 --> 02:40:08.014]  And so that Disney and pop culture and the pop stars, they had a huge role in mainstreaming a lot of the satanic and the baphomet imagery that you're talking about.
[02:40:08.474 --> 02:40:11.615]  And it was right around the same time, probably, that the skateboarding world did, too.
[02:40:12.015 --> 02:40:14.696]  And again, I think the point here is that it's not accidental.
[02:40:14.816 --> 02:40:16.496]  It's more like a top down thing, right?
[02:40:16.536 --> 02:40:24.878]  It's like people who are running these corporations, whether it's in the domain of music industry or wherever it is.
[02:40:24.918 --> 02:40:25.418]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:40:25.478 --> 02:40:25.918]  Exactly.
[02:40:26.861 --> 02:40:32.362]  There's top-down, really wealthy people who I believe are actually into Satanism.
[02:40:32.382 --> 02:40:33.503]  They're actually into this stuff.
[02:40:33.563 --> 02:40:37.604]  They believe that they're enacting a new aeon, a new era.
[02:40:37.664 --> 02:40:49.467]  I just read a long interview from a Satanist who died right before he died 10 years ago, and he was saying actually a lot of the things that would occur that we're seeing now, especially with COVID and all this stuff rolling out.
[02:40:50.177 --> 02:40:53.821]  He was saying that it's actually a satanic plan, so I don't know if you have any thoughts on that.
[02:40:53.841 --> 02:41:00.269]  Do you see what we're going into with the New World Order being a satanic plan that's covering all the bases, like you said?
[02:41:02.732 --> 02:41:06.356]  I absolutely think there is a plan for that, and I totally agree with you on that.
[02:41:07.898 --> 02:41:09.220]  It's not an accident, you know?
[02:41:10.698 --> 02:41:13.579]  Yeah, that was me just getting a good read.
[02:41:13.599 --> 02:41:17.059]  In the mask, in the face mask.
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:19.900]  You gotta do the face shield.
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:22.841]  It's the only way you can make sure you're safe in your house.
[02:41:22.861 --> 02:41:24.521]  You should have doubled up, at least.
[02:41:26.081 --> 02:41:33.103]  Well, I had spectacles on, too, so I had double eye protection from any droplets, you know?
[02:41:33.123 --> 02:41:36.263]  You gotta watch out for faulty droplets.
[02:41:36.784 --> 02:41:38.224]  The droplets are floating.
[02:41:39.571 --> 02:41:44.612]  You know, we were joking about Jersey Shore wives, and I was realizing that Fauci actually kind of has a Jersey Shore wife.
[02:41:44.772 --> 02:41:46.273]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:46.313 --> 02:41:48.353]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:41:48.373 --> 02:42:00.757]  If you want to support the work that I do, you can go to my website, jaysanalysis.com, and you get access to all of the archives, years of interviews and lectures covering 50-plus writings of the global elite themselves over the last 100 years.
[02:42:01.832 --> 02:42:03.812]  To my knowledge, no one else has done that.
[02:42:03.832 --> 02:42:07.613]  I have to toot my own horn a little bit here to support the work that I do.
[02:42:07.733 --> 02:42:18.135]  Also, be sure to go to the InfoWars store and support the work that Alex and the great crew are doing in terms of being the spearhead of the alternative media and fighting the New World Order.
[02:42:18.155 --> 02:42:21.276]  So we're getting into this global plan of the New World Order.
[02:42:22.216 --> 02:42:25.817]  You were talking about some of the videos that you've been making, trolling.
[02:42:25.857 --> 02:42:27.717]  You have Klaus's book there.
[02:42:28.518 --> 02:42:33.125]  When did you first hear about this idea of the plan for a global government, a global reset?
[02:42:33.165 --> 02:42:40.818]  Is that something you heard about a long time ago through the counterculture arena of skateboarding, or is that something that you kind of woke up to more recently?
[02:42:43.365 --> 02:42:48.589]  You know, I first heard about all this stuff years ago.
[02:42:49.289 --> 02:43:00.757]  I was in probably junior high school and I just got sucked into like one of those YouTube vortexes when you start watching YouTube videos and you get suggestions and you keep going deeper and deeper and deeper.
[02:43:01.137 --> 02:43:03.098]  And I came across some documentaries.
[02:43:03.518 --> 02:43:04.239]  I watched those.
[02:43:04.279 --> 02:43:05.280]  They blew my mind.
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:07.081]  And then I was thinking about it a lot.
[02:43:07.241 --> 02:43:13.165]  And then as I went about my life, you know, I got distracted and I kind of I kind of forgot about it.
[02:43:14.336 --> 02:43:25.600]  Over the next probably like 10 to 12 years and I was just reminded again about this about like two and a half three years ago About this plan.
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:38.805]  So I've been you know more And it's easier to to you know research now as the Internet's gotten, you know bigger and everything and there's more people that are putting out Information about it.
[02:43:39.285 --> 02:43:42.786]  So Yeah, I've known about it for a long time
[02:43:43.646 --> 02:43:44.967]  You know, life happens.
[02:43:45.608 --> 02:43:53.073]  I kind of got distracted and now we're back here and I'm learning all about the Great Reset and it's just, it's a great idea.
[02:43:53.093 --> 02:43:59.999]  I think we should all, you know, get rid of all of our vehicles and get electric.
[02:44:00.797 --> 02:44:18.539]  Yeah, I've got an appointment scheduled with my endocrinologist next week and then hopefully he'll make sure that I'm infertile and that'll be good for Bill Gates.
[02:44:21.053 --> 02:44:24.056]  If you, real quick, can I just shout out my buddy Dark Iron Gaines?
[02:44:24.076 --> 02:44:28.720]  He actually, he printed this out for me and this is a news article that you guys might have missed.
[02:44:29.401 --> 02:44:36.587]  This is when he used my back muscles to block out the sun because, you know, global warming and everything.
[02:44:36.807 --> 02:44:41.491]  And then he celebrated with a nice worm of recycled human urine.
[02:44:42.252 --> 02:44:43.493]  He was drinking that after.
[02:44:43.513 --> 02:44:45.235]  So that was very good.
[02:44:46.673 --> 02:44:48.194]  Well, we appreciate you and Billy.
[02:44:48.234 --> 02:44:49.434]  We gotta get those numbers down.
[02:44:49.534 --> 02:44:53.636]  I'm gonna be working with Wacking Ball and we're gonna get the human numbers down.
[02:44:53.656 --> 02:44:54.997]  We're gonna block out the sun.
[02:44:55.017 --> 02:44:59.439]  Who else comes up with crazy plots to block out the sun?
[02:44:59.479 --> 02:45:03.361]  That's like... Yeah, that's some Batman villain stuff right there.
[02:45:03.441 --> 02:45:04.221]  Superman villain.
[02:45:04.281 --> 02:45:07.883]  He's a comic book villain and I don't know why some people don't realize that.
[02:45:09.887 --> 02:45:10.468]  Well, I saw it.
[02:45:10.488 --> 02:45:14.512]  So you have the book there and it's and I've got my class book sitting right here.
[02:45:14.712 --> 02:45:18.316]  And, you know, it's amazing that they can put this stuff out in the open.
[02:45:18.596 --> 02:45:28.727]  And I think that's I've always said that's part of the gaslighting technique, you know, is to put it in the open, put it in your face, hidden in plain sight, you know, and show everybody that this is what they're actually doing.
[02:45:28.767 --> 02:45:30.569]  And what that does is it kind of has this
[02:45:31.569 --> 02:45:34.431]  Uh, effect of putting people into a catatonic state.
[02:45:34.471 --> 02:45:39.573]  Like they don't, they don't know what to do and they just accept it and they become apathetic.
[02:45:39.593 --> 02:45:41.274]  Oh, well, I guess there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:45:41.354 --> 02:45:46.897]  Cause like, he's a really rich dude and like he runs a bunch of, uh, business things.
[02:45:46.957 --> 02:45:49.538]  So I guess he has to tell us what to do.
[02:45:49.818 --> 02:45:49.999]  Right.
[02:45:50.019 --> 02:45:51.739]  So it's just this default to authority.
[02:45:51.759 --> 02:45:55.061]  Like, Oh, I guess, you know, uh, we just follow whatever they say.
[02:45:55.641 --> 02:46:00.544]  But you know, the whole skating community was about not defaulting to authority.
[02:46:00.624 --> 02:46:00.764]  Right.
[02:46:02.237 --> 02:46:02.758]  Exactly.
[02:46:02.798 --> 02:46:06.160]  There's actually a skateboarding trick called a no comply.
[02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:09.182]  And I think we need to start doing that one more.
[02:46:09.902 --> 02:46:23.231]  Yeah, skateboarding was totally again is totally was anti-establishment, like, no, no referees, no, you, nobody's telling you what to say and do how to dress how to everything like that.
[02:46:23.291 --> 02:46:23.571]  And now,
[02:46:25.053 --> 02:46:29.676]  Every brand, well, first of all, the top brands in skateboarding now aren't even skateboarding brands.
[02:46:29.936 --> 02:46:36.960]  They're companies like Nike who bought their way into skateboarding because they offered the pro skaters more money.
[02:46:37.321 --> 02:46:41.143]  And the pro skaters, they, you know, weren't happy with having a second job.
[02:46:41.463 --> 02:46:50.590]  They wanted to be like on this rock star status like Tony Hawk or something like the very few that sold themselves out to these corporate brands.
[02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:54.112]  They took the Nike check and now they're trapped and they need to be told
[02:46:54.872 --> 02:47:12.098]  What to do and say and they can't have an opinion and you know, it just went totally woke in the name of progressive pardon me progressivism they You know, they got females on these skate teams, but unfortunately, they're not really females They're just guys in dresses.
[02:47:12.538 --> 02:47:22.362]  So that's what they've done with that and I think it's just very goofy and it's just totally just it's made the whole thing just just a
[02:47:22.941 --> 02:47:23.861]  A huge joke.
[02:47:24.121 --> 02:47:30.063]  And, you know, it's sad to see that the women too, you know, supporting stuff like this.
[02:47:30.103 --> 02:47:33.424]  It's like, seems like it's very disrespectful for themselves.
[02:47:35.465 --> 02:47:36.385]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[02:47:36.465 --> 02:47:48.708]  I don't think people understand that, you know, as I was reading this Satanist guy's Last Will and Testament essay that he wrote before he passed away in 2010, he actually says pretty honestly what all of this is about.
[02:47:48.788 --> 02:47:51.009]  And he says that it's all an attack on everyone.
[02:47:52.157 --> 02:47:52.517]  I think so.
[02:48:13.454 --> 02:48:29.983]  Bertrand Russell said that you won't be reading Shakespeare, you won't be reading the Bible, and then just this week we had universities in Canada burning books, literally out of Fahrenheit 451, the famous dystopian novel, literally saying you can't read these texts, they're banned now.
[02:48:30.043 --> 02:48:35.866]  So they've reinstituted banning, which everybody, I thought we believed in free speech or something like that, right?
[02:48:36.026 --> 02:48:38.167]  But no, now books are banned, books are burned.
[02:48:38.887 --> 02:48:40.149]  Uh, you can't talk about this.
[02:48:40.189 --> 02:48:43.472]  You can't, you know, they are intentionally dumbing people down.
[02:48:45.088 --> 02:48:49.229]  There's this interview with this essay that the Satanist wrote before he died in 2010.
[02:48:49.449 --> 02:48:55.391]  He says, we will reduce the Western population by about, he says, 60 or 70 percent by 2030.
[02:48:55.811 --> 02:49:00.592]  And we will have the Western world being almost illiterate by 2021.
[02:49:01.813 --> 02:49:05.054]  So here we are in 2021, 10 years after he wrote his essay.
[02:49:05.474 --> 02:49:10.275]  And I would say that, yeah, the Western world is almost, functionally speaking, illiterate.
[02:49:10.295 --> 02:49:13.176]  Like people can't read, they can't do logic, they can't think.
[02:49:13.736 --> 02:49:22.804]  They can't figure out what's going on when there's like 50 plus, 100 plus books written explaining what's going on from the people doing it.
[02:49:25.146 --> 02:49:28.689]  Yeah, you were talking about gaslighting and that's, you know, their go-to.
[02:49:29.569 --> 02:49:39.638]  And it seems like basically the way they do, you know, they do their rollouts for these ideas and these policies is
[02:49:40.875 --> 02:49:48.060]  They hint at it, people start talking about it, and then those people are conspiracy theorists and they're crazy.
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:53.023]  And then once it comes true, then they flip to, oh, this is actually a good idea for us.
[02:49:53.063 --> 02:49:53.784]  We should do this.
[02:49:53.844 --> 02:49:55.285]  And they convince you that it's a great idea.
[02:49:55.525 --> 02:49:57.126]  That's what they did with the Great Reset.
[02:49:57.146 --> 02:50:01.689]  You know, 15 months ago, that was a conspiracy theory, the Great Reset.
[02:50:01.989 --> 02:50:06.192]  Now there's a book called COVID-19, The Great Reset by Klaus Schwab.
[02:50:06.652 --> 02:50:08.413]  So yeah, that's what they do.
[02:50:10.035 --> 02:50:13.017]  If I could jump back to real quick, you mentioned the water being contaminated.
[02:50:13.618 --> 02:50:16.820]  It's funny you mentioned that because I just recently did a video for my Patreon.
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:24.945]  I was explaining how I believe that TRT is a trap to get you dependent on synthetic hormones from the pharmacy.
[02:50:25.386 --> 02:50:31.390]  And I covered one of the ways that's lowering men's testosterone is that the water is poisoned
[02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:36.592]  And, you know, of course, everybody knows about Alex and his viral comment about the frogs.
[02:50:37.212 --> 02:50:38.092]  And that's true.
[02:50:38.172 --> 02:50:40.373]  There's a chemical in the water called Atrazine.
[02:50:41.013 --> 02:50:44.775]  It was given to frogs and 30 to 40% of them were unable to reproduce.
[02:50:45.755 --> 02:50:48.336]  Some of them had given high doses.
[02:50:48.516 --> 02:50:55.758]  Actually, the male frogs then developed female reproductive systems and started getting pregnant.
[02:50:56.199 --> 02:50:59.360]  So, yeah, they have
[02:51:01.625 --> 02:51:08.548]  80% of the tap water in the United States contains 30 times more atrazine than was given to those frogs.
[02:51:08.989 --> 02:51:18.273]  So if people want to wonder why their test is low and why that's such a problem with America today, that's a huge reason right there.
[02:51:19.113 --> 02:51:19.593]  Exactly.
[02:51:19.954 --> 02:51:22.335]  And keep in mind, this is not a new idea.
[02:51:22.355 --> 02:51:26.096]  It's actually mentioned by many of the global elite back before even Ehrlich.
[02:51:26.497 --> 02:51:27.577]  It's mentioned by Kessler.
[02:51:27.617 --> 02:51:28.718]  It's mentioned by Bertrand Russell.
[02:51:28.738 --> 02:51:29.538]  They all talk about
[02:51:30.174 --> 02:51:35.856]  Poisoning the food and the water to socially engineer, dumb down, mutate the population.
[02:51:35.916 --> 02:51:40.438]  Jonas Salk, all of these guys who are part of that Global League Club have talked about this for ages.
[02:51:40.478 --> 02:51:42.278]  Well, we're coming to the end of the interview.
[02:51:42.298 --> 02:51:43.559]  I want to thank you so much for coming on.
[02:51:43.639 --> 02:51:47.100]  Anything you want to tell us, leave us with, remind everybody where they can follow you.
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:49.081]  And thank you so much for coming on Wackenball.
[02:51:50.453 --> 02:51:51.894]  Thank you for having me, Jay.
[02:51:52.054 --> 02:51:53.015]  I really appreciate it.
[02:51:53.455 --> 02:51:56.717]  And, uh, yeah, I just want to, uh, you know, plug my Patreon.
[02:51:57.117 --> 02:51:59.239]  It's patreon.com slash weck.
[02:52:00.019 --> 02:52:06.643]  And, uh, for anybody that's not a skateboarding fan, uh, no worry because I have plenty of other kinds of content on there.
[02:52:06.663 --> 02:52:11.086]  I have comedy videos, sketches, long format that are not skateboarding related.
[02:52:11.126 --> 02:52:13.568]  They're just, you know, there's some pop culture stuff on there.
[02:52:17.967 --> 02:52:26.192]  And you pick the people that run those agencies and the deputies that are pledging allegiance to the New World Order and good governance.
[02:52:26.353 --> 02:52:31.376]  We will be looking at what contact tracing looks like in the New World Order.
[02:52:31.696 --> 02:52:33.357]  I am not happy being vindicated.
[02:52:33.637 --> 02:52:37.720]  I am not happy having the entire Rockefeller New World Order U.N.
[02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.281]  takeover plan unfolding.
[02:52:39.781 --> 02:52:45.265]  I am not happy to see the mayor of Chicago saying you must pledge allegiance to the New World Order when she's talking about lockdowns.
[02:52:45.905 --> 02:52:56.113]  I am not happy when we see the head health minister in Australia say, contact tracers are coming, you can't leave your house ever unless you've had shots of these experimental injections, this is the new world order.
[02:52:56.593 --> 02:52:57.634]  I'm not happy about that.
[02:52:57.934 --> 02:52:59.475]  I knew it was coming, I tried to stop it.
[02:52:59.816 --> 02:53:01.457]  But we're not caught flat footed.
[02:53:01.517 --> 02:53:09.663]  People are really awake around the world and the globalists are trying to censor and failing because they can't get their agenda through if the people know the truth.
[02:53:09.843 --> 02:53:13.326]  And out of all the great resistance out there, Rand Paul and so many others,
[02:53:14.699 --> 02:53:16.620]  Roger Stone's out there fighting it.
[02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:18.301]  We've got Joe Rogan.
[02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:21.742]  We've got all those great people like Tucker Carlson and all of you out there.
[02:53:22.143 --> 02:53:28.726]  But out of all the groups and organizations, it is the InfoWars listeners and viewers that are the biggest and most hardcore and most effective.
[02:53:28.986 --> 02:53:30.907]  That's why they hate me, because they hate you.
[02:53:31.447 --> 02:53:33.488]  So more than ever, tell folks about Bandot Video.
[02:53:33.728 --> 02:53:35.129]  Tell folks about InfoWars.com.
[02:53:35.369 --> 02:53:36.550]  Tell them the truth lives there.
[02:53:36.830 --> 02:53:40.111]  And not just check it out, but to share it with others and tell them to share it.
[02:53:40.412 --> 02:53:41.652]  And that triggers a chain reaction.
[02:53:41.872 --> 02:53:42.673]  And then separately,
