[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:09.054]  If you had to name the single most effective member of the House in terms of fighting for the America First agenda, it would have to be Matt Gaetz.
[00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:19.100]  It's not incidental that right here on this show, only weeks ago, I mentioned him very realistically as a presidential contender.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.402]  So this is a search and destroy mission.
[00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:26.543]  I know Matt Gaetz to be a person of extraordinary integrity.
[00:00:27.124 --> 00:00:28.944]  He was a playboy.
[00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:34.526]  He is now engaged to a wonderful woman, Ginger, who I've met several times.
[00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.867]  They're very much in love.
[00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:38.028]  This is not the Matt Gaetz that I know.
[00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:40.308]  This is a cheap political trick.
[00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:43.069]  This is an effort to derail his career.
[00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.572]  Folks don't know this, but Matt Gaetz's family is among the wealthiest families in Florida.
[00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:55.174]  Therefore, the motive of extortion of blackmail is a very realistic one.
[00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:58.055]  But I agree with your analysis.
[00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:06.658]  I saw the congressman looking very confident, very upbeat, very much on the attack, not looking like a whipped puppy.
[00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:10.159]  And I'd like to see them release those tapes.
[00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.880]  You see, that's the key.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.022]  I think the tapes that I understand were made with the supervision of the FBI.
[00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:19.063]  Working on the weekend like usual!
[00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.093]  Down in the deep end like usual.
[00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:51.437]  Wow, we're in the center of the zeitgeist.
[00:01:51.517 --> 00:02:00.306]  I barely just slid into my chair here because we've got so many big breaking news stories that we're working on right now that are so exclusive and so important.
[00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:06.887]  I can tell you I've talked to the highest levels of the media food chain about the Congressman Matt Gaetz situation.
[00:02:06.907 --> 00:02:10.988]  I've also talked to his good personal longtime friend and confidant, Roger Stone.
[00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:18.269]  I have made a lot of other phone calls and ascertained exactly what's going on with the whole Matt Gaetz extortion deep state takeover.
[00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.370]  Roger Stone joins us coming up in the second hour today.
[00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:26.371]  And he's still getting all the details together right now.
[00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.451]  But it definitely Matt Gaetz is telling the truth.
[00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:30.672]  What he said on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:39.579]  But we have, as they say, the rest of the story, and the globalists want us off the air, so you don't learn the rest of the story, so they can lie and gaslight everybody.
[00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.240]  That's coming up.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.901]  Then, in studio, Stuart Rhodes.
[00:02:45.541 --> 00:03:00.026]  And we've got Politico reporting that the political case against almost everybody that, quote, attacked the Capitol is going to fall apart because they were waved in by police, and most of them didn't even not walk between the velvet ropes.
[00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:06.462]  Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers in studio with his lawyer coming up today in the third hour.
[00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.363]  And I will continue to host into the fourth hour.
[00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.203]  And then we have other guests joining us partway in.
[00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.764]  But I've got so much to cover.
[00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:13.564]  G. Gordon Liddy died.
[00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:14.384]  A great guy.
[00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:15.425]  Great patriot.
[00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:16.285]  Great talk show host.
[00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:16.925]  Great American.
[00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:21.846]  Boy, if the FBI was like him today, we wouldn't be in this problem that we're in with these communists and globalists.
[00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:22.486]  We've got that.
[00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:28.088]  We've got the open announcement of the Global ID run by China openly in our news.
[00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:29.088]  Total insanity there.
[00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:39.772]  We have Biden acting like a total psychotic with his staff acting like rabid hyenas or something towards the media and the media groveling.
[00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:45.216]  I mean, we are witnessing incredibly historic times.
[00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:52.002]  You know, in fact, guys, there's an InfoWars article about the case falling apart and feds shocked that they're going to have to drop all the cases.
[00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:55.425]  But I actually want the Politico article that's linked to that.
[00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:56.566]  I forgot to tell you about that.
[00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:02.329]  So give me that Politico article that they're going to have to not get jail times.
[00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:07.031]  These people on the left is totally panicking because I can't find that now on my stack and I just had it.
[00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:09.553]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.254]  Separately, commerce is the way to fight these people.
[00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:18.838]  That's why they're blacklisting people, deplatforming, taking Trump's bank accounts, taking our bank accounts, getting rid of Parler, trying to shut down Gab.
[00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.300]  People have to move their systems away from this.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.662]  Well, you know, we wouldn't be on air if it wasn't for Epic.
[00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:28.263]  One of the only true domain registrars on a reseller.
[00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.904]  There's only like two of them that leave conservatives and Christians up now.
[00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:34.605]  Even AR15.com had their domain seized.
[00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:36.425]  That's a mainline gun site by GoDaddy.
[00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:37.566]  They wouldn't give it back for a while.
[00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:40.747]  So go to InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:41.767]  That's epic.
[00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:49.111]  And you get the lowest prices on moving domains you already have, or registering domains, or servers, or protected systems.
[00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:52.173]  They've got all the services you need, and they are expanding.
[00:04:52.614 --> 00:04:55.055]  And I can tell you they've even headhunted some of our crew over to them.
[00:04:55.115 --> 00:04:56.796]  They're such big fans, which is fine.
[00:04:57.137 --> 00:04:58.838]  So they're building our escape pod over there.
[00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.159]  I'll just tell you point blank.
[00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:02.920]  So InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.764]  You want to move away from the New World Order if your domain is with anybody else, you are insane.
[00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:09.265]  Go there now.
[00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:15.848]  Go to InfoWarsDomains.com and a very small part of moving your domain or signing up goes to us.
[00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:17.089]  It doesn't increase the price.
[00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.570]  It's the same price, lowest price.
[00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.332]  We just get a small percentage of it to fund our operation.
[00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:23.313]  InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:05:23.393 --> 00:05:24.033]  Move there now.
[00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:26.775]  InfoWarsDomains.com.
[00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:28.036]  Powered by the great folks.
[00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:29.384]  I don't
[00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:50.646]  They've got the highest quality body armor at the lowest price.
[00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:51.627]  It's going to blow you away.
[00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:55.551]  10% off promo code Alex at CitizenStronghold.com.
[00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.293]  CitizenStronghold.com.
[00:05:57.513 --> 00:05:59.035]  CitizenStronghold.com.
[00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:01.257]  We'll be right back with massive exclusive news.
[00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:01.658]  Stay with us.
[00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:10.807]  History is happening all around us and we intend to not be spectators in the bleachers.
[00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:31.888]  But we intend to be gladiators in the arena, and so I'll start this broadcast this March 31st, Wednesday, 2021 Global Transmission of the Alex Jones Show with a great, trust-busting, anti-globalist president, Theodore Roosevelt, the man in the arena.
[00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:38.923]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:57.418]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause,
[00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:11.582]  Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:23.366]  And later, after Roger Stone leaves us at the end of the next hour, I'm going to spend a segment on SpaceX had another rocket blow up, but they've also gotten the only heavy lifter
[00:07:24.824 --> 00:07:26.184]  Bigger than the Russian heavy lifters.
[00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:30.646]  Bigger than the Saturn rockets that Wernher von Braun designed.
[00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:36.468]  The biggest heavy lifter in the world, with the biggest payload into space successfully.
[00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:39.529]  And they had over, what was it, seven, eight spacecraft blow up before they did that.
[00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.670]  NASA had the same thing.
[00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.591]  They'd have 20 spacecraft blow up for boosters before they got that done.
[00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:46.932]  That's what this is about.
[00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:48.653]  And nobody else is willing to do the risk.
[00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:55.835]  Bezos, not Virgin Atlantic, not the Russians, not the Chinese, show Elon Musk is willing to do it.
[00:07:57.036 --> 00:08:01.558]  And every time one of his rockets blows up, they're like, oh, look, his rocket blew up.
[00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:03.339]  What the hell do you think we're doing here?
[00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:11.264]  You think you like, you know, when you're five years old, get into boxing and you don't get your ass kicked 50 times before you become a badass or learn boxing for you?
[00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:18.924]  But see, Musk has won a bunch of the heavyweight championships of rocketry now, so it's not like all his perseverance didn't pay off.
[00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:26.346]  Another SpaceX spaceship prototype explodes during high-altitude flight test, and the media is calling him a loser, as usual.
[00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:32.447]  No, the losers are the people that point their fingers at people that are doers and say that we're the losers.
[00:08:32.487 --> 00:08:34.608]  No, you are the losers.
[00:08:36.368 --> 00:08:38.228]  Okay, let me break this down for you.
[00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.529]  If Congressman Matt Gaetz
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.781]  Son of a big successful billionaire.
[00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:49.244]  Wasn't well-spoken, wasn't pro-Constitution, didn't have courage, wasn't a fighter.
[00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:52.646]  I would not give a damn about him.
[00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.327]  He'd be like an old shoe, I'd throw it away.
[00:08:55.628 --> 00:09:00.871]  And if any evidence of him screwing kids came out, I would absolutely come out against him and say he should be put in prison.
[00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:06.935]  But he's not Joe Scarborough found with a dead girl in his office with her brains bashed out, who then is a good globalist who gets a show on.
[00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:12.075]  MSNBC with the daughter of a famous war criminal, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mika.
[00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:21.022]  And so I made some calls to some very well-known people, and that know Gates very, very well, and I got the inside baseball on what's going on.
[00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:22.142]  I'll reveal it next hour.
[00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:27.986]  But there's no crime being a young man and a playboy, and over the years dating hundreds of women.
[00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:29.808]  This is a Donald Trump type deal.
[00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:35.692]  And the story itself's a fraud, and the extortion is a fraud, and it's not true.
[00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:48.298]  And so if Matt Gaetz was on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gaetz and Bill Clinton 28 times, and they had 15-year-old girls on there, I'd say put him in prison for 100 years.
[00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:58.084]  But trying to claim there were women saying they were 25 years ago who were really 17 at a party that he was at is not enough.
[00:09:59.534 --> 00:10:08.881]  For me to turn against Gates, especially when the Democratic Party's doing this, and especially, I'll reveal for the first time here, I went to the FBI a few years ago, when somebody tried to extort me, who I hadn't had sex with.
[00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.183]  And I talked to the experts, I said, you gotta go report it.
[00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:14.125]  I went and said, hey, I'm being extorted, here's the text messages.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.600]  They had five agents in the room.
[00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:20.941]  I mean, let me tell you, you try to extort my ass, I know the FBI's corrupt.
[00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:24.823]  Point is, I go right to them, so it's on record that you tried to set me up.
[00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:30.024]  You tried to, let me tell you, they got people, they got the media will give people money to say anything.
[00:10:30.204 --> 00:10:36.906]  They paid people $20,000 to say, I walked around the office and grabbed a goldfish out of a fish tank at the office and ate it.
[00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:41.848]  There's never been a goldfish here, and I like fish.
[00:10:43.044 --> 00:10:44.265]  I would never kill a goldfish.
[00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:45.566]  That's ridiculous.
[00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:46.627]  I got dogs.
[00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:47.348]  I got cats.
[00:10:47.388 --> 00:10:48.029]  I got fish.
[00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.090]  I love animals.
[00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:49.330]  What?
[00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.512]  Plus, I don't think goldfish taste very good.
[00:10:51.532 --> 00:10:52.853]  I mean, I'm not a, I'm a seafood guy.
[00:10:52.873 --> 00:11:01.662]  If it's fresh and I've caught it or it's lobster or you know, it's a good white fish or whatever, but you know, I'm not, but the point is the level of lying.
[00:11:01.902 --> 00:11:07.928]  So when I've been accused of wearing swastika tennis shoes and killing people's goldfish and crap like this,
[00:11:10.632 --> 00:11:13.436]  I tend to not believe the stuff I hear and take it with a grain of salt.
[00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:17.641]  But I've made some calls and what you're hearing about Gates is pure bull.
[00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:24.309]  He doesn't even know, from wild parties he was at over the years, he doesn't even know who this woman is.
[00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:26.810]  Um, and I had the same damn thing.
[00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.773]  You get invited to some condo, there's 30 people at it, you don't even kiss anybody.
[00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:35.336]  And then you got somebody saying, you give me $100,000 or I'm gonna say what you did to me.
[00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:37.277]  And I'm like, hey, FBI's on speed dial!
[00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:38.458]  Hey, I'm coming in right now!
[00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:43.741]  But I'm telling you, man, this is what happens when you're successful and you're famous, and it's crap.
[00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:44.702]  You try to extort me?
[00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:51.386]  I'm going to try to get the FBI to arrest your ass because it's not true, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:53.809]  I don't even speed in my car anymore.
[00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:54.850]  I used to.
[00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:04.141]  I gave my dad or he's buying and he says my Hellcat that I love so much, but I press it down to 100 here and there in the middle of nowhere, 150 sometimes when nobody's in the car.
[00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:05.683]  I just don't need that in my life.
[00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:06.964]  My dad loves it though.
[00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:10.527]  So I'm driving along in my truck in the slow lane now.
[00:12:10.587 --> 00:12:12.328]  My kids are like, God, Dad, you're like Grandpa.
[00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:14.269]  Yeah, well, I'm thinking while I'm driving.
[00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.991]  I don't even speed anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:18.632 --> 00:12:20.393]  I am Mr. Dudley Durite.
[00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:21.834]  The cops pull over and say, have you been drinking?
[00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:23.034]  Yeah, I had a half bottle of wine.
[00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:23.695]  Boone, you're arrested.
[00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:24.355]  Why'd I tell the truth?
[00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:26.256]  Because I've gotten neurotic about it.
[00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:26.997]  It's a power.
[00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:31.340]  The more I tell the total truth, the more I can't even twist things anymore.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.441]  Because I used to lie my ass off when I was a teenager.
[00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:35.502]  Did you steal $100 out of my wallet?
[00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:36.443]  No, Dad, I didn't.
[00:12:36.983 --> 00:12:44.933]  I'd have the vodka and Milwaukee's Best hiding in the bushes outside of that party that night with those college girls that were coming over when I was a teenager.
[00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:53.750]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm here to tell you that this Gates stuff is BS, and Roger Stone's made some phone calls.
[00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:54.471]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.271]  He's joining us at noon today.
[00:12:57.032 --> 00:13:02.253]  And he, of course, is good friends with Matt Gates and worked with his campaign, and he's the guy that got Gates on the show the time that Gates was here.
[00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:03.074]  I like Gates.
[00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:04.014]  Gates has got courage.
[00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:05.014]  Gates is strong.
[00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:05.875]  The enemy doesn't like him.
[00:13:08.263 --> 00:13:12.405]  Again, we catch him with, you know, 12-year-old girls at Lolita Express.
[00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:15.667]  Well, we want to call for his, uh, hell, how about execution?
[00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:18.228]  But you're not going to find that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:19.689]  You're not going to find that.
[00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:22.491]  So we're going to be looking at that exclusively today.
[00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:27.473]  G. Gordon Liddy-Dobb, we're going to be breaking all of that down as well.
[00:13:28.334 --> 00:13:33.316]  There is so much more that we're going to be discussing when we get into Matt Gaetz.
[00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:35.798]  And we're going to use this to make it about the Clintons.
[00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:48.530]  And to make this about Bill Gates, and the minute Matt Gaetz talks about Bill Gates, and the minute he talks about Epstein, they're gonna drop this like a hot hand grenade.
[00:13:50.103 --> 00:13:51.164]  And that's what needs to happen.
[00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:57.288]  So as soon as I sussed out, people that have talked to Gates, and Gates has been honest, twice says, no, I don't know this woman.
[00:13:57.328 --> 00:13:59.070]  No, I don't know if I've ever had sex with somebody underage.
[00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.351]  That's not what I do.
[00:14:00.471 --> 00:14:12.059]  I just know these Democrat lawyers, former Justice Department official, wanted $25 million at $4 million increments, and my dad wore a wire of the FBI, and I can't believe this is in the New York Times, because the FBI was getting ready to arrest these people.
[00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:17.063]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:18.925]  It is just incredible.
[00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:22.167]  So that's all coming up so much today.
[00:14:22.608 --> 00:14:25.069]  But we've got huge news on the global government.
[00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.151]  World ID run by China.
[00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:32.575]  Biden is adopting the Communist Chinese tracking system for the apps, for the face scans.
[00:14:32.595 --> 00:14:34.697]  This is a total world government takeover with the UN.
[00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:41.206]  And communist China, that means the Rockefellers, Rothschilds run the UN, partner with China, Pencer attack against us.
[00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:48.028]  We've got so much to break down and Hillary attacking shameless gun worshippers.
[00:14:48.068 --> 00:14:59.912]  Oh, you worship guns when you're running sex slaves out of Serbia or Bosnia or taking over Libya and killing a couple hundred thousand or the Arab Spring killing over a million and shipping guns in fast and furious out of the U.S.
[00:14:59.952 --> 00:15:02.332]  to Mexico and other areas, you murdering monster.
[00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:04.133]  Or when you make jokes about how you got
[00:15:04.673 --> 00:15:09.635]  Pedophiles off that raped a little girl so bad she could never have children again because they ruptured her cervix.
[00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:12.495]  Cramming giant flashlights in her.
[00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:15.796]  I mean, you know, she's like laughing about how much she enjoyed hearing about the raped girl.
[00:15:16.036 --> 00:15:17.937]  You're a monster pig going to hell!
[00:15:18.197 --> 00:15:19.217]  Burn in hell, Hillary!
[00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:20.118]  Burn in hell!
[00:15:20.358 --> 00:15:22.218]  I pray you burn in hell!
[00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:23.719]  Burn in hell!
[00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:26.900]  In the name of Jesus Christ, Hillary, please burn in hell!
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.120]  That's not blasphemy.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.581]  I mean that.
[00:15:29.641 --> 00:15:34.082]  Jesus, please, please rid us politically and lovingly and liberally of Hillary.
[00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:37.109]  Hillary says we worship guns.
[00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.891]  Do we really worship guns?
[00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:40.954]  And the other question is, what does she really worship?
[00:15:43.021 --> 00:16:04.580]  The opportunists on the other side, like Cruz and his ilk, they know better, and they are in the position of trying to keep people really riled up and scared that sensible gun legislation, like we had in the 90s for 10 years, will somehow undermine their rights.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.662]  Well, what about the rights of all the rest of us?
[00:16:07.202 --> 00:16:16.208]  The rights of us to go to work, go shopping, go on dates to the movie theater, go to school, for heaven's sakes.
[00:16:16.248 --> 00:16:17.629]  What about the rest of us?
[00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:21.972]  You know, democracy is the balancing of interests and rights.
[00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:37.002]  And unfortunately, at this time, the gun worshippers have a huge advantage because of the filibuster and because of their shameless exploitation of people's unwarranted fears.
[00:16:37.022 --> 00:16:41.524]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[00:16:41.544 --> 00:16:44.866]  Did it have anything to do with your visit?
[00:16:44.986 --> 00:16:46.347]  No, I'm sure it did.
[00:16:48.988 --> 00:16:49.888]  Well, there you go.
[00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:59.293]  Hillary attacks shameless gun worshippers who are against sensible
[00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:02.419]  Gun control legislation.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.480]  You know, you can go to the Unidear UN website.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.421]  You can go to their own statements.
[00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:08.441]  They want to take all the semi-autos.
[00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:09.942]  That's over 80% of the guns.
[00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:12.402]  Semi-automatic hunting shotguns, everything.
[00:17:12.883 --> 00:17:18.524]  They've taken the guns everywhere else in the world except Switzerland and a little bit in Australia and a few places.
[00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:22.926]  Mexico has a total gun ban, the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:17:23.326 --> 00:17:24.326]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:29.388]  And we maybe have a couple hundred people die a year in mass shootings.
[00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:30.408]  It's like 200 on average.
[00:17:32.022 --> 00:17:37.089]  Hell, you get 14 black males wrongfully shot each year that are adjudicated wrongfully.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.182]  Maybe a hundred black males shot by police, that's maximum?
[00:17:41.983 --> 00:17:45.465]  Oh, it doesn't matter, you got like, you know, three, four million blacks aborted each year, that's okay.
[00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:48.847]  Or tens of thousands of blacks shoot and kill each other, that's okay.
[00:17:49.247 --> 00:17:52.229]  But oh my God, if a white cop does something wrong, let's burn everything down.
[00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:57.633]  Because the media uses that as a distraction from the real things that are going on.
[00:17:58.374 --> 00:18:01.355]  Hillary, front of the Arab Spring, overthrew our allies.
[00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:03.817]  Millions died, over a million died.
[00:18:04.197 --> 00:18:05.118]  Destroyed Libya.
[00:18:05.678 --> 00:18:06.499]  Destroyed Egypt.
[00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:07.680]  Destroyed Syria.
[00:18:09.264 --> 00:18:14.640]  Because she had the more sophisticated bombs and guns and she didn't want anybody to be armed.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.605]  She told Gaddafi, famously under Obama.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:41.530]  You turn your guns in, you invest 20 billion dollars, that was over half their GDP, extra, in our companies, and we will, you turn your weapons in, and not just nuclear weapon precursors, not just chemical weapons, he gave them his artillery, he gave them his heavy weapons, he gave them his jets, and he was like trying to go to meetings with Obama at the world stage, trying to shake his hand, and Obama would shake his hand, he'd kiss their ass, because he was literally giving all the money to the people there.
[00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.371]  Women in college, everything.
[00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:45.052]  He was funding all of Africa.
[00:18:45.072 --> 00:18:47.054]  I mean, Gaddafi, compared to them, is an angel.
[00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:50.377]  And they set him up when he gave the weapons up.
[00:18:50.677 --> 00:18:53.239]  He let Western intelligence in to run everything.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.901]  He said, I want to be with you.
[00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:57.543]  And they used it to set... They didn't just kill him.
[00:18:57.563 --> 00:18:59.645]  They could have killed him and had the country.
[00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:00.886]  They wanted to blow it up.
[00:19:01.506 --> 00:19:02.367]  They wanted to wreck it.
[00:19:02.687 --> 00:19:04.389]  They didn't take him out back and shoot him in the head.
[00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:06.490]  They blew the whole place up.
[00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.453]  You can look at the photos of Libya one year, Libya the next year.
[00:19:09.753 --> 00:19:10.494]  Destroyed.
[00:19:12.858 --> 00:19:15.540]  And that's what happens at a higher level.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.543]  He had heavy weapons, gave them up, they annihilated him.
[00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:20.844]  We have guns, give them up, they annihilate us.
[00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:22.746]  Oh, it's our religion.
[00:19:22.766 --> 00:19:25.808]  No, our religion is knowing you're a liar and we love God and hate you.
[00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:30.452]  Our religion is knowing you're a fraud and want us to disarm you, witch, that you have bodyguards we don't.
[00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:36.517]  Hell, I have trouble affording armed security here and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:19:36.797 --> 00:19:40.180]  But I have limited security and it's hard for me to pay for.
[00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.011]  And I'm a guy that has some money.
[00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.513]  The average person can't pay for bodyguards.
[00:19:45.873 --> 00:19:48.996]  They have to have guns themselves.
[00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:53.059]  And how dare you do that, you monster witch!
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.662]  Now when we come back, Biden is launching the mark of the beast.
[00:19:57.762 --> 00:19:58.663]  China is the model.
[00:19:58.723 --> 00:19:59.223]  It's official.
[00:19:59.243 --> 00:20:02.626]  I have the mainline headlines that China has the model for the world ID.
[00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:05.649]  Oh, you can't have all these other people with their vaccine passports.
[00:20:05.929 --> 00:20:09.392]  We've got one that China has, that the UN's adopting, that Biden's adopting.
[00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:10.273]  Did you hear that?
[00:20:10.553 --> 00:20:19.921]  Not just a national ID, not just a medical ID, not just a tracker system to leave your house or have a job or go to a restaurant or get on an airplane or a bus or a train or a boat.
[00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:23.824]  But now China runs it.
[00:20:25.097 --> 00:20:31.021]  Just like Apple three years ago moved to China and was in Reuters saying, we gave the control keys to every Apple user to China.
[00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:33.363]  That's what you do when you're based in China, close quote.
[00:20:34.263 --> 00:20:35.604]  But it's okay if they're running death camps.
[00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:39.387]  China has main access to the main death camps, the slave camps with millions in them.
[00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:42.529]  That's mainstream news, but it's okay because they're liberal.
[00:20:42.569 --> 00:20:43.790]  You see, it's like, well, it's all right.
[00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.171]  I mean, it's so trendy.
[00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:51.555]  So here is Marjorie Taylor Greene, the future of the Republican Party, voted in 75% of the vote.
[00:20:53.757 --> 00:20:59.522]  On vaccine passports, talking about Hillary's religion and Biden's religion being the mark of the beast.
[00:20:59.782 --> 00:21:00.723]  Call it what it is.
[00:21:00.763 --> 00:21:01.183]  Here it is.
[00:21:01.824 --> 00:21:09.590]  What should not be put over all of us is something called a vaccine passport.
[00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:17.397]  A vaccine passport that Americans would be required to have in order to travel, to go to events, to buy and sell.
[00:21:18.055 --> 00:21:22.819]  Now, how are they wanting to push this on to Americans?
[00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:33.768]  They are talking to private companies, big corporations, big powerful corporations that will enforce these policies on you.
[00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:38.432]  Because you see, if Democrats pass this law, well then, what will all of us say?
[00:21:38.912 --> 00:21:40.794]  We will call them communist.
[00:21:41.274 --> 00:21:43.696]  We will call them fascist, right?
[00:21:43.776 --> 00:21:45.437]  These are the names we will call them.
[00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:53.201]  But if the companies do it, then it's a company policy and they're just saying, oh, this is to keep everyone safe.
[00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.663]  When you fly in their plane, you need your vaccine passport.
[00:21:58.243 --> 00:22:07.607]  Oh, if you're going to come into the football game or the baseball game or the concert, you need your vaccine passport because we're trying to do a good job to keep everyone safe.
[00:22:08.047 --> 00:22:12.629]  This is what the Biden administration is trying to talk to these private companies into doing.
[00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:14.230]  Well, let's analyze that.
[00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.432]  You see, it's still the same thing.
[00:22:17.713 --> 00:22:23.878]  It's still fascism or communism, whatever you want to call it, but it's coming from private companies.
[00:22:24.098 --> 00:22:25.139]  So I have a term for that.
[00:22:25.239 --> 00:22:26.841]  I call it corporate communism.
[00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:37.350]  These are private corporations who thrive on capitalism and have, through the free marketplace here in America, have become successful.
[00:22:38.411 --> 00:22:44.177]  And are doing well, selling their goods, selling their services, selling their products.
[00:22:44.797 --> 00:22:55.067]  But yet, they are adapting these communist policies, just like the Democrats are, and they are pushing them on us through their private companies.
[00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:58.231]  Bingo, bingo, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:22:58.671 --> 00:23:01.374]  The globalists call it crony capitalism.
[00:23:02.813 --> 00:23:04.094]  Or corporate fascism.
[00:23:04.114 --> 00:23:06.956]  But the true term is corporate communism.
[00:23:07.817 --> 00:23:11.359]  Before Xi Jinping, the last leader, said, we are the ultimate form of capitalism.
[00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:12.620]  Our communism is capitalism.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.601]  You know, what does that mean?
[00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:18.344]  Well, Obama went to Latin America and said, we need one country that's communist that works with capitalists.
[00:23:18.384 --> 00:23:19.125]  That's the new system.
[00:23:19.585 --> 00:23:20.806]  Well, it's just called slavery, folks.
[00:23:20.826 --> 00:23:21.427]  That's all it is.
[00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.609]  And so that's what they set up.
[00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:28.112]  And it's corporate governance where all the corporations get together.
[00:23:28.152 --> 00:23:30.814]  And the Restaurant Association globally says,
[00:23:31.638 --> 00:23:32.779]  QR code for a menu.
[00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:35.021]  Now QR code, somebody's had their vaccine to come in your door.
[00:23:35.422 --> 00:23:36.683]  And now it's the buses, the trains.
[00:23:36.983 --> 00:23:41.267]  It's corporate governance, removing the people's elected governments, bringing in corporate governance.
[00:23:41.527 --> 00:23:49.995]  That's what the Libertarians missed is these corporations are acting as governments and banding together with governmental control, just like a foreign group of pirates invading us.
[00:23:50.015 --> 00:23:51.716]  Libertarians are like, we're a free market.
[00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:52.978]  Oh, look, the Vikings are here.
[00:23:53.318 --> 00:23:54.159]  They're not a government.
[00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:55.080]  They're about to kill you.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.040]  Yeah, they are.
[00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:01.725]  So you got to organize some government to counter the barbarians that are literally pulling up the Vikings.
[00:24:01.765 --> 00:24:02.025]  See?
[00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:04.247]  We'll be right back with huge news.
[00:24:04.307 --> 00:24:05.188]  Stay with us on the border.
[00:24:06.569 --> 00:24:11.693]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide as we are Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:24:11.713 --> 00:24:12.254]  to 3 p.m.
[00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:16.237]  as I've been doing for 25 years in this time slot.
[00:24:17.538 --> 00:24:18.879]  About 24 in this time slot.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.421]  16 years with the Sunday Show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:23.663]  On air 27 plus years.
[00:24:28.038 --> 00:24:29.559]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:31.780]  This is not about making fun of people.
[00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:33.101]  It's not about putting people down.
[00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:35.323]  But if you don't do that, it doesn't get their attention.
[00:24:35.923 --> 00:24:41.807]  Sometimes you gotta hit a mule upside the head with a 2x4 when it won't get up out of the ditch and get back to the barn.
[00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:47.431]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:24:48.511 --> 00:24:51.894]  One time we done surgery on a horse out in the middle of a field.
[00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:56.220]  And we were done and we had it tied down and we got it done.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.767]  We were looking for a large animal that had fire ants all over it because they'd come over where we were at.
[00:25:01.088 --> 00:25:01.568]  They were all over.
[00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:02.991]  The horse was pissed and didn't want to get up.
[00:25:07.176 --> 00:25:08.137]  We had it all over its eyes.
[00:25:08.157 --> 00:25:09.578]  We're trying to get the fire ants off.
[00:25:09.618 --> 00:25:11.180]  We had to do this C-section really quick.
[00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:15.824]  And we just had to get a piece of PVC pipe out, start beating it in the ass to get it up.
[00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:19.528]  Didn't enjoy hitting the horse in the end of the ass with that PVC pipe.
[00:25:19.928 --> 00:25:29.297]  We had a cattle prod in the back of the truck too, but took about two minutes, got its ass up, went back to the barn with its owner watching us, trying to, you know, help us get it up, trying to pull it up.
[00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:33.440]  And so, when I do this, it's not with enjoyment.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.561]  Like when a horse breaks its leg at the Kentucky Derby and they shoot it, you know?
[00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:44.163]  You're sad its leg's broken, just most of the time they're so heavy, they're so powerful, it's hard to mend a horse's leg, it never really comes back.
[00:25:44.483 --> 00:25:49.385]  This is not an exercise in animal cruelty, it's an exercise in reality and animal husbandry.
[00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:51.326]  But I digress.
[00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:55.487]  We have a perfect example of why they hate
[00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:17.407]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, because she's a listener of this show, and so are others, and they're educated about how the world works, and they can see it for themselves, and they see the corporate communism, how they've created monopolies for themselves, and now the big corporations want tyranny for all the rest of us, and they're using classical forms of tyranny with technocracy to dominate us.
[00:26:18.916 --> 00:26:33.645]  Now the Republicans are told, oh, be afraid of her, stay away from her, because if they adopt what she's saying, when she won by 75 percentage points, the highest record in years for a Republican to be elected to Congress, the past record was like 69%.
[00:26:33.705 --> 00:26:37.407]  She topped that by 6 points.
[00:26:37.447 --> 00:26:38.188]  What was she saying?
[00:26:38.428 --> 00:26:44.172]  There's a new world order, a Chai Com takeover, corporate communism, they're coming for your guns, they're destroying the border, they're the enemy.
[00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.612]  Let's do something, let's stand up.
[00:26:45.973 --> 00:26:47.834]  That's what you do when you're under attack.
[00:26:55.089 --> 00:26:57.511]  And sometimes you gotta get a piece of PBC pipe out.
[00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:00.454]  Nice little piece of PBC pipe.
[00:27:01.434 --> 00:27:02.695]  Would it be better for the horse to die?
[00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:04.977]  Because it weighs thousands of pounds.
[00:27:04.997 --> 00:27:05.778]  You're trying to get it up.
[00:27:05.818 --> 00:27:06.378]  It won't get up.
[00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:09.501]  Let's see.
[00:27:09.521 --> 00:27:10.562]  Oh, that's politically incorrect.
[00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:11.523]  Okay, let it die then.
[00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.264]  See, that's the left for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:16.367 --> 00:27:17.548]  Oh, by the way, we saved the baby horse.
[00:27:18.308 --> 00:27:18.669]  The colt.
[00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.272]  So, continuing here.
[00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:26.333]  Ladies and gentlemen, people ask, well, why were you doing it on Noah's Hill?
[00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:32.837]  Because the horse wouldn't get its ass up and go to the barn to do the surgery in a nice little padded area with little hay down there.
[00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:39.180]  Again, that's not how the world works for your liberal fantasies when you grow up in your high-rise buildings, thinking you know how everything operates.
[00:27:42.182 --> 00:27:48.845]  You got a horse covered in fire ants with a colt's head sticking out its rear end, and they're both going to die if you don't get it out.
[00:27:48.865 --> 00:27:49.525]  You got to cut it open.
[00:27:52.674 --> 00:27:56.278]  You gotta get the colt out, you gotta sew it up, and then you gotta get the horse up!
[00:27:56.818 --> 00:28:01.403]  We can't even admit we're on our side, dying, with fire ants all over us!
[00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:02.864]  So we don't have any hope!
[00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:06.988]  But see, those are real life lessons.
[00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.971]  And you know, I did the same damn thing to cows.
[00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:16.278]  They act just the same when they're in the middle of the field, you're doing a cesarean on them, with come-alongs, a lot of times, jerking those calves out.
[00:28:17.927 --> 00:28:19.108]  But let's continue here.
[00:28:19.968 --> 00:28:23.770]  I'm not a cool guy like the governor of Virginia that actually keeps babies alive and harvests their organs.
[00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.211]  That's liberal and good to keep babies alive and kill them.
[00:28:26.612 --> 00:28:28.232]  To save animals is bad.
[00:28:28.252 --> 00:28:29.813]  It's what the left brain works, you understand?
[00:28:30.554 --> 00:28:31.174]  The left's brain.
[00:28:32.314 --> 00:28:36.036]  But since I've hit that, she's going right to the chase with what's going on.
[00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:39.438]  She's cutting right to the issue.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.521]  And if we cut right to the issue,
[00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:51.039]  It's game over for them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.463]  But if we just debate issues all day and debate their claims and sit there and have their arguments, we don't have a hope.
[00:28:58.063 --> 00:28:59.083]  So let's get to it right now.
[00:28:59.584 --> 00:29:00.564]  Here's a perfect example.
[00:29:01.145 --> 00:29:09.008]  Our crew's on the border, the UN organizes this, George Soros is in Reuters, he's in AP years ago, paying for the cancel taxpayer money under Obama.
[00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:13.111]  Trump killed the funding two years in that Obama still had grandfathered in.
[00:29:14.091 --> 00:29:18.516]  The same groups hitting Europe with the Zodiac boats and the ships and the millions pouring in.
[00:29:18.536 --> 00:29:25.623]  $1,000 debit cards, $3,000 debit cards with no names, bags of cash, USAID packs from the State Department.
[00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:28.807]  And we exposed it, and Lou Dobbs exposed it, and Sean Hannity exposed it.
[00:29:29.087 --> 00:29:34.333]  They have articles saying this doesn't exist, this is insane, Fox News should ban them from the airwaves.
[00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:39.429]  Even though it's like saying Madison Square Garden is in New York City.
[00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.311]  It's an absolute damn fact.
[00:29:41.371 --> 00:29:43.792]  Or the Washington Monument is in Washington, D.C.
[00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:45.834]  Or the Goodyear Blimp's a blimp.
[00:29:46.514 --> 00:29:48.015]  Grass is green, the sky is blue.
[00:29:49.396 --> 00:29:51.898]  Because if you ever have a real debate, it's game over.
[00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:54.380]  Instead, oh, there's no migrant surge.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.080]  Remember last week?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.261]  The Washington Post, New York Times, all of them.
[00:29:58.783 --> 00:29:59.683]  There's no surge.
[00:30:00.003 --> 00:30:00.864]  There's no crisis.
[00:30:01.184 --> 00:30:04.667]  And the Republican addled, aging senators
[00:30:05.808 --> 00:30:10.152]  Are still debating all of that with the media.
[00:30:10.172 --> 00:30:12.954]  And they're down at the border going, look, there's a crisis here.
[00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:15.296]  You need to admit it so we can fix it.
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:15.857]  Fix it?
[00:30:16.337 --> 00:30:17.758]  Biden said surge the border.
[00:30:17.979 --> 00:30:19.720]  Biden helped set up the UN centers.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.702]  It's a damn attack to break the border.
[00:30:22.162 --> 00:30:29.629]  But we can't ever even get to what's actually happening because you're too busy debating the Washington Post telling you that nothing's happening.
[00:30:31.946 --> 00:30:34.168]  Like debating whether they're coming for our guns or not.
[00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.909]  Hillary, nobody's coming for your guns!
[00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:36.809]  Just turn them in!
[00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.311]  Here's a Newsmax article.
[00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:46.856]  Ex-ICE Director, Homan, Administration designed surge to permanently break the borders.
[00:30:47.056 --> 00:30:47.456]  Bingo!
[00:30:47.636 --> 00:30:48.016]  Bingo!
[00:30:48.197 --> 00:30:48.597]  Bingo!
[00:30:48.777 --> 00:30:49.157]  Bingo!
[00:30:50.798 --> 00:30:51.939]  And he goes through it all right there.
[00:30:51.979 --> 00:30:53.380]  Of course, they said they were.
[00:30:56.762 --> 00:30:59.484]  Oh, but Senate Republicans drop epic video.
[00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:03.398]  Proving border situation is in fact a crisis.
[00:31:03.758 --> 00:31:07.843]  So we're all just busy proving there's a crisis.
[00:31:07.863 --> 00:31:11.587]  Like your leg's cut off and you have a debate about while you're dying, well is it cut off or not?
[00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:13.569]  Well my blood's all spraying out, oh sorry I'm dead.
[00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.972]  Well I was busy debating whether it was happening or not, I'm dead.
[00:31:16.798 --> 00:31:20.160]  It's this sick game, like this drag queen story time pedophile run.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.402]  I don't know, almost all the leaders I've been getting arrested being pedophiles.
[00:31:23.322 --> 00:31:24.583]  And we just play this idiocy.
[00:31:24.743 --> 00:31:30.407]  So here's the Republicans debating whether there's a crisis or whether the sun came out this morning.
[00:31:30.447 --> 00:31:30.847]  Here it is.
[00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:47.999]  Are not allowed to come.
[00:31:48.459 --> 00:31:50.440]  We want the American people to see what's happening.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.341]  But Joe Biden doesn't want you to see that.
[00:31:53.921 --> 00:32:04.224]  We're so overwhelmed with traffic here in the Rio Grande Valley sector that there's just nonstop flow of people coming across illegally, mainly children, family units.
[00:32:04.984 --> 00:32:15.587]  Senator Cruz and I invited our colleagues from the United States Senate to come down here to see what we have a chance to see and to listen to the experts, namely you,
[00:32:16.887 --> 00:32:18.868]  What's exactly happening here at the borders?
[00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:20.089]  We're here to listen.
[00:32:20.589 --> 00:32:21.610]  We're here to learn.
[00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:27.473]  We're here to see with our own eyes exactly what is unfolding, the tragedy that is unfolding.
[00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:28.594]  Okay, so let's stop there.
[00:32:28.714 --> 00:32:30.235]  They got piano music.
[00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:34.037]  The Republicans are all smiling like they're movie stars.
[00:32:34.377 --> 00:32:36.478]  Like they just got the play in the high school play.
[00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:40.501]  Like they just won, you know, to be the homecoming king and queen.
[00:32:41.653 --> 00:32:42.554]  And they're lightweights.
[00:32:43.014 --> 00:32:46.336]  You know, Cruz is okay, at least he's smart, but they're all still lightweights.
[00:32:46.657 --> 00:32:56.203]  You have to attack the whole thing head-on for a globalist breaking of our borders, run by the UN, replacement migration, an admitted plan to bring in a political group you control.
[00:32:56.523 --> 00:32:58.465]  Say it all, and that's how you beat it.
[00:32:59.568 --> 00:33:03.931]  That's how you get 75% approval ratings and voting ratings like green.
[00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:06.633]  That's how we got so popular is the truth.
[00:33:06.934 --> 00:33:08.755]  People are sick of filtered crap.
[00:33:09.376 --> 00:33:10.817]  The video goes on for five more minutes.
[00:33:10.877 --> 00:33:14.219]  I mean, it is just, oh, music and oh, the poor children.
[00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:15.761]  We gotta get them processed quicker.
[00:33:15.821 --> 00:33:27.710]  We gotta, nothing about the UN, nothing about world government, nothing about Biden saying surge the border, proving he's behind it, nothing about calling for his impeachment, nothing about calling for his indictment, nothing about child smuggling,
[00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.971]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing!
[00:33:30.392 --> 00:33:33.574]  But a bunch of Republicans, we're here to prove there's a crisis!
[00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:37.676]  It's like having a man on fire, and you're like, hey, is he on fire?
[00:33:37.696 --> 00:33:40.318]  Well, let's debate it or not, or we hit him with a fire extinguisher.
[00:33:40.398 --> 00:33:41.179]  God Almighty!
[00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:47.883]  As soon as we got the leftists out in the open admitting they want our guns, they lost the gun control debate.
[00:33:48.724 --> 00:33:53.707]  And as soon as we get everybody to admit it's a Chi-Com globalist takeover with COVID-19, game over!
[00:33:54.787 --> 00:34:00.889]  They said Republicans play the game, they wear the damn mask, they do the Kabuki theater, and it's disgusting and it's out of control.
[00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:04.030]  And I just told you those large animal vet stories.
[00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:11.792]  I worked half a year one time when I was kicked out of high school for fighting for a year for a large animal vet, I guess about eight months.
[00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:14.813]  Then I worked a few summers before that, and this is just standard procedure.
[00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:24.341]  Because when a cow or a horse is dying, when it's having a baby and fire ants have been biting it for hours, you get out there, you're saving the cow, you're saving the horse, you're saving the calf.
[00:34:24.361 --> 00:34:25.502]  Sometimes you can't save the calf.
[00:34:25.762 --> 00:34:27.003]  There's fire ants all over you.
[00:34:27.063 --> 00:34:27.964]  You've got a scalpel.
[00:34:28.584 --> 00:34:30.366]  You're helping the vet cut as fast as you can.
[00:34:30.406 --> 00:34:31.467]  You're going into the uterus.
[00:34:31.747 --> 00:34:33.909]  You're trying to pull the calf out this way or that way.
[00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.672]  You've got come-alongs, you know, that you use on a truck to try to get the baby out.
[00:34:37.732 --> 00:34:38.693]  I mean, it's hellish.
[00:34:39.813 --> 00:34:43.734]  Or you just shoot the animal and they drag it off and coyotes eat it, and that's when the farmer does that.
[00:34:44.014 --> 00:34:47.155]  When the farmer decides to save a horse or a cow, it's because they called you.
[00:34:48.115 --> 00:34:50.656]  Is it inhumane they shoot the cow or the horse when they're covered with ants?
[00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:51.557]  Or dying?
[00:34:51.617 --> 00:34:52.797]  No, that's getting them out of their pain.
[00:34:53.197 --> 00:34:54.837]  But this is what goes on in this country.
[00:34:54.857 --> 00:34:56.258]  It's what goes on all over the world.
[00:34:57.688 --> 00:35:02.412]  And I use the analogy of America's like a horse down, covered with ants.
[00:35:03.053 --> 00:35:09.078]  And if you don't get the horse up, you can try to grab its bridle, you can show it range cubes, you can pet it, you can get mommy there to beg it.
[00:35:09.518 --> 00:35:12.120]  By the time you get there, they've been trying to get it up sometimes for a day.
[00:35:12.461 --> 00:35:13.421]  It's just covered with ants.
[00:35:15.123 --> 00:35:16.884]  And you tell them, you need to go ahead and shoot your horse.
[00:35:17.004 --> 00:35:18.466]  Oh no, we like old Betsy.
[00:35:18.746 --> 00:35:19.567]  Grandkids love her.
[00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:21.849]  You gotta try to get her up and get her going.
[00:35:22.952 --> 00:35:27.874]  And you just go to work, folks, and then you sit there and you go, OK, you're going to help me beat the horse to get it up now.
[00:35:28.255 --> 00:35:31.576]  And you're sitting there with the owner beating the horse's ass to get it up.
[00:35:32.577 --> 00:35:34.738]  Is it fun to do that or you just cut the country loose?
[00:35:35.318 --> 00:35:36.279]  That is the point.
[00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.539]  Finally, the damn horse gets up.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.922]  You don't even feel good after you beat it, sometimes for five minutes or a cow.
[00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:49.553]  The trick people learn, though, is just dogs around the ranch, they're not afraid of.
[00:35:49.573 --> 00:35:53.696]  Sometimes you've got a downed cow that won't get up, you've got to bring a dog that doesn't know.
[00:35:53.736 --> 00:35:55.037]  They'll get up real quick for a dog.
[00:35:55.617 --> 00:35:59.700]  But again, this is the little tricks out there for people that want to save cows and horses.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.801]  And so I went off into this whole jag.
[00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:05.484]  I'm sure the Animal Liberation Army, you know, or something will say I'm being mean to animals.
[00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:07.545]  This is the real world.
[00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:11.808]  They'd tell you let ants eat it and let it die over two days instead of saving it.
[00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:15.652]  There's like, I forget what verse it is in the Bible.
[00:36:15.672 --> 00:36:16.372]  Is it the Old Testament?
[00:36:17.192 --> 00:36:20.414]  Where the man's going down the road and the horse, the mule, won't walk.
[00:36:20.814 --> 00:36:21.614]  So he's beating it.
[00:36:21.634 --> 00:36:24.356]  And all of a sudden he looks in the road and there's an angel right there.
[00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:25.636]  That's why the mule wouldn't keep going.
[00:36:25.656 --> 00:36:30.619]  But the stories of trying to get horses and cows moving are legendary in every culture.
[00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:32.519]  And that's just the reality of this.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.360]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.861]  I got a lot to hit, a lot to cover, a lot to go over.
[00:36:36.881 --> 00:36:38.462]  But those are true stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:39.082 --> 00:36:40.163]  Believe me, they're true stories.
[00:36:41.954 --> 00:36:43.195]  But they were good learning experiences.
[00:36:43.976 --> 00:36:45.137]  Very good learning experiences.
[00:36:47.018 --> 00:36:48.579]  But see, the left never gets their hands dirty.
[00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:53.423]  They would just, it's just, oh, I'm not, they just pull up and get the hamburger at the restaurant.
[00:36:53.884 --> 00:36:59.228]  They don't want to know anything about where it came from, none of how it was done, what people went through to bring it to them.
[00:36:59.388 --> 00:37:01.910]  They just don't want any responsibility.
[00:37:04.692 --> 00:37:07.575]  And it's why they're domesticated, it's why they're stupid, it's why they're dumbed down.
[00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.373]  Now, Roger Stone is going to have the inside scoop.
[00:37:12.453 --> 00:37:16.396]  I've got, from my angles, my sources that talk to Gates.
[00:37:17.477 --> 00:37:19.218]  Gates has been on the show, but I haven't talked to him in years.
[00:37:19.899 --> 00:37:22.781]  And we got a pretty good picture of what happened and what's unfolding.
[00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:25.043]  This is deep state globalist extortion.
[00:37:26.084 --> 00:37:26.925]  Is he a playboy?
[00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:29.047]  Was he at some parties with Wild Girls years ago?
[00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:31.569]  Maybe.
[00:37:31.669 --> 00:37:35.412]  He truthfully does not remember or does not know, but this is extortion.
[00:37:35.432 --> 00:37:36.313]  This is a dirty trick.
[00:37:37.932 --> 00:37:38.412]  Bare minimum.
[00:37:38.432 --> 00:37:46.559]  So we're going to be looking at that and using this as a teaching moment about how he can take this attack and turn it around against him.
[00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:52.564]  And if he does that, well, he'll be able to bring the globalists to justice and expose the fact that he is innocent.
[00:37:54.486 --> 00:37:55.747]  We'll see if Gates listens to us.
[00:37:55.947 --> 00:37:58.569]  That is coming up here in just a minute.
[00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.411]  But he's got great enemies, so we like him.
[00:38:00.971 --> 00:38:02.372]  He's got a lot of courage, so we like him.
[00:38:02.933 --> 00:38:04.654]  He's up against election fraud and gun grabbing.
[00:38:04.674 --> 00:38:05.095]  We like him.
[00:38:06.343 --> 00:38:09.248]  Then after Roger leaves us, the big vaccine news.
[00:38:09.408 --> 00:38:09.869]  Here it is.
[00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.214]  Battle rages over vaccine passports.
[00:38:15.444 --> 00:38:23.247]  Republicans are up in arms over the possibility that businesses and local governments may require vaccine passports for people to get access to certain activities, buildings and events.
[00:38:23.387 --> 00:38:23.927]  Wow!
[00:38:24.167 --> 00:38:29.549]  I mean, it's only Mark of the Beast, total control, run by China, absolute fraud, corporate governance.
[00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:33.411]  I mean, it's just a giant leftist power grab over society, holding everybody hostage.
[00:38:33.691 --> 00:38:35.912]  The answer is boycott all their systems immediately.
[00:38:36.932 --> 00:38:41.753]  Oh, but of course, CNBC, mutations could render current COVID vaccines ineffective in a year or less.
[00:38:42.313 --> 00:38:47.494]  Epidemiologist warns that works for big pharma, so you've all got to have 10 shots a year, of course.
[00:38:48.894 --> 00:38:52.115]  Variants fuel increasing hospitalizations and lockdowns in Canada.
[00:38:52.575 --> 00:38:56.256]  More lies, more martial law, more fraud, more BS.
[00:38:57.016 --> 00:39:05.738]  Experts warn failure to rapidly vaccinate the world creates dangerous opening for COVID mutations, even though the actual literature says the COVID vaccine can create the actual mutations.
[00:39:08.294 --> 00:39:10.896]  And it goes on from there.
[00:39:11.697 --> 00:39:16.741]  We've got so much that we're going to be breaking down, but they really get to why they're really doing it.
[00:39:17.241 --> 00:39:23.567]  LA Times journalist says vaccine passports are good to break the resistance down for a world ID.
[00:39:26.527 --> 00:39:27.247]  And here's a big one.
[00:39:27.627 --> 00:39:30.669]  This is a big one by Jamie White at Infowars.com that needs to get out.
[00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:35.711]  Yes, and the Chinese are going to run it with their Huawei and the rest of it.
[00:39:35.731 --> 00:39:35.791]  Man.
[00:39:44.855 --> 00:39:48.558]  The endgame is here, in a big, big way.
[00:39:48.979 --> 00:39:55.344]  But oh, Joe Scarborough, found with a dead intern with their brains brushed out, slams idiots who oppose vaccine passports.
[00:39:55.364 --> 00:39:58.247]  They're living in ignorance and stupidity.
[00:39:58.887 --> 00:40:02.371]  Yes, because we don't trust out-of-control big pharma with liability protection.
[00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:08.096]  That is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:08.116 --> 00:40:11.398]  And the big question is, can Vegas recover from COVID?
[00:40:12.318 --> 00:40:14.320]  Von Mises Institute on Infowars.com.
[00:40:14.641 --> 00:40:19.927]  Whether you want Sin City to recover or not, it's the only place you can still see George Strait.
[00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:21.329]  It's kind of important.
[00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:24.152]  Whether you want to recover or not, everybody's under this attack.
[00:40:24.192 --> 00:40:25.574]  It's the service economy under attack.
[00:40:25.594 --> 00:40:27.817]  They told us, oh, you won't be industry, you'll be service.
[00:40:27.837 --> 00:40:29.158]  You won't be farming, you'll be service.
[00:40:30.059 --> 00:40:31.561]  You won't be an artisan, you'll be service.
[00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:35.090]  And now they're saying you're obsolete, you're non-essential.
[00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:42.955]  And so it isn't that COVID caused them to go bankrupt, the fake lockdowns caused the bankruptcy and the shutdowns and the closings.
[00:40:43.276 --> 00:40:45.737]  The fake lockdowns caused an extra 10 million to starve to death.
[00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:51.722]  So whenever somebody says this happened because of COVID, no, it happened because the COVID used the chicken little fear to drive that system.
[00:40:54.155 --> 00:41:00.362]  So we'll be laying all of it out coming up, but as I told you, Roger Stone next hour, a lot of exclusive intel on G. Gordon Liddy.
[00:41:01.423 --> 00:41:03.525]  Roger was the youngest plumber, the only one not to go to jail.
[00:41:05.107 --> 00:41:06.909]  What a piece of history Roger Stone is.
[00:41:07.089 --> 00:41:09.972]  And of course, he'll speak to Neil Caputo.
[00:41:11.485 --> 00:41:12.526]  And so much more.
[00:41:13.246 --> 00:41:15.407]  And we're going to look at the Matt Gaetz situation.
[00:41:15.787 --> 00:41:19.049]  It's all coming up in the next hour.
[00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:27.533]  A Biden supposed infrastructure plan is to shut down our infrastructure with carbon tax and so much more in the next hour.
[00:41:28.374 --> 00:41:32.756]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you about something that's very exciting, and it's a great deal.
[00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:38.959]  It's apples and oranges, but this is amongst the best deals you're going to get if you want a satellite phone.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:40.900]  Because you can either
[00:41:42.452 --> 00:41:54.038]  Pay $700, $650, $700 for the same sat phone and then buy the minutes on a card or get the phone free and then do a year program and just pay for the minutes and a little bit more for the minutes than you normally would if you actually had to buy the sat phone.
[00:41:54.118 --> 00:41:55.339]  I think this is the best deal out there.
[00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:57.700]  It's InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.963]  When the cell towers go down, along with the power failure, satellite phones will still work.
[00:42:02.283 --> 00:42:06.285]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everywhere you go and everywhere you say.
[00:42:06.585 --> 00:42:08.046]  Satellite phones do not do that.
[00:42:08.306 --> 00:42:10.668]  Satellite phones work in every extreme remote location.
[00:42:11.548 --> 00:42:13.230]  So as long as you can see the sky, your phone will work.
[00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.313]  They have antennas and things for the house and the car as well to make it work inside.
[00:42:16.754 --> 00:42:21.519]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone with only $99.95 per month for 150 minutes per month.
[00:42:21.779 --> 00:42:23.721]  And by the way, everybody can call you for free.
[00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:27.425]  It just costs you the minutes you already have when you use it.
[00:42:28.206 --> 00:42:32.309]  No charge for receiving calls, again, from other cell phones or landlines to your satellite phone.
[00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:33.150]  So call me.
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.751]  I can't call you unless it's an emergency.
[00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:36.292]  I have one in my car now and my house.
[00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:38.193]  Car antennas, home antennas are all available.
[00:42:38.213 --> 00:42:41.215]  Stay in touch with loved ones during any national or international emergency.
[00:42:41.616 --> 00:42:42.917]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-0.
[00:42:42.957 --> 00:42:43.457]  That's 941-955-1020.
[00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:44.858]  941-955-1020 and ask for the Alex Jones special.
[00:42:55.768 --> 00:43:12.385]  And then separately, this is the last day of the free shipping on Emmerich's Essentials, on all of the Iodine products, on Living Defense Parasite Cleanse, on all the Iodine products, and of course, on Cabochill Regular and Extra Strength.
[00:43:12.725 --> 00:43:13.326]  And a lot more.
[00:43:13.386 --> 00:43:18.433]  That sale will end tomorrow morning, as I promised, because so much stuff is already sold out.
[00:43:18.794 --> 00:43:21.278]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:21.858 --> 00:43:24.302]  I would get your orders in.
[00:43:24.682 --> 00:43:26.385]  Oh, and a little piece of news you might want to know.
[00:43:26.846 --> 00:43:28.428]  It just came back in after being sold out!
[00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:31.171]  Even though it sold out so quick last time in two weeks.
[00:43:31.271 --> 00:43:35.334]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, your liquid multivitamin with amino acids and minerals.
[00:43:35.354 --> 00:43:38.737]  40% off and free shipping is the new special.
[00:43:39.157 --> 00:43:42.100]  InfowarStore.com right now.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.141]  And it won't last long because I'm keeping it discounted.
[00:43:44.502 --> 00:43:45.963]  And that funds the InfoWar.
[00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:46.803]  Oh, I almost forgot.
[00:43:47.804 --> 00:43:52.548]  50% off on activated charcoal toothpaste also ends today.
[00:43:53.249 --> 00:43:53.989]  And free shipping on it.
[00:43:54.009 --> 00:43:54.950]  That makes us a loss leader.
[00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.012]  You get just this and free shipping.
[00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:57.893]  We lose money on this.
[00:43:58.706 --> 00:43:58.966]  Okay.
[00:43:59.407 --> 00:44:00.688]  So, infowarestore.com.
[00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:01.088]  Try it out.
[00:44:01.148 --> 00:44:01.969]  It's an amazing toothpaste.
[00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:03.550]  My dad, a retired dentist, designed.
[00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:04.151]  All right.
[00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:08.294]  Hour number two with Roger Stone, the inside intel on Matt Gaetz and more.
[00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:08.815]  Stay with us.
[00:44:10.182 --> 00:44:11.423]  Welcome back, Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:11.563 --> 00:44:16.648]  I thought Congressman Matt Gaetz did a great job on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:44:16.688 --> 00:44:18.349]  The full interview is at Infowars.com.
[00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:22.633]  Roger Stone, there's good friends with him, helped him run for Congress, got him on the show before.
[00:44:23.073 --> 00:44:24.595]  He's going to give us his inside take on it.
[00:44:24.635 --> 00:44:27.037]  I talked to people at the top of the media food chain that know Gaetz.
[00:44:27.437 --> 00:44:29.119]  They've got a good idea of actually what went down.
[00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:29.879]  It is a shakedown.
[00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:30.500]  It is criminal.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.602]  We're going to talk about it in a few minutes with Roger Stone.
[00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:35.064]  But first, here's a few minutes of Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:44:36.462 --> 00:44:49.991]  Just a couple of hours ago, late this afternoon, the New York Times ran a story saying that Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz is under federal investigation for playing some role in sex trafficking and potentially having a relationship with a 17-year-old girl.
[00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:55.174]  There are very few details in major news outlets tonight about this story.
[00:44:55.215 --> 00:44:58.977]  We have no background on it all and not even any very informed questions.
[00:44:59.718 --> 00:45:06.182]  Instead, we've invited Congressman Gaetz on the show to respond to these stories and give us his view of them.
[00:45:06.582 --> 00:45:07.966]  Congressman, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:45:07.986 --> 00:45:08.567]  I appreciate it.
[00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:12.236]  So, this is obviously a serious allegation.
[00:45:12.938 --> 00:45:15.905]  Tell us what the truth is from your perspective.
[00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.751]  It is a horrible allegation, and it is a lie.
[00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:26.718]  The New York Times is running a story that I have traveled with a 17-year-old woman, and that is verifiably false.
[00:45:26.798 --> 00:45:30.262]  People can look at my travel records and see that that is not the case.
[00:45:30.902 --> 00:45:36.828]  What is happening is an extortion of me and my family involving a former Department of Justice official.
[00:45:37.409 --> 00:45:50.959]  On March 16th, my father got a text message demanding a meeting wherein a person demanded $25 million in exchange for making horrible sex trafficking allegations against me go away.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.842]  Our family was so troubled by that, we went to the local FBI.
[00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:55.643]  Yes.
[00:46:12.634 --> 00:46:22.816]  The audio recordings that were made under their supervision and at their direction, which will prove my innocence and that will show that these allegations aren't true.
[00:46:23.117 --> 00:46:26.197]  They're merely intended to try to bleed my family out of money.
[00:46:26.777 --> 00:46:41.141]  And this former Department of Justice official, tomorrow, was supposed to be contacted by my father so that specific instructions could be given regarding the wiring of $4.5 million as a down payment on this bribe.
[00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:59.429]  I don't think it's a coincidence that tonight, somehow, the New York Times is leaking this information, smearing me, and ruining the investigation that would likely result in one of the former colleagues of the current DOJ being brought to justice for trying to extort me and my family.
[00:47:00.586 --> 00:47:08.972]  So a couple of obvious questions that come to mind, and again, just to restate, this just happened, don't have any other information beyond what we've already said and you have said.
[00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:13.936]  First of all, who is this Department of Justice former employee who's trying to extort the money from you, you say?
[00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:15.777]  His name is David McGee.
[00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:21.241]  He was a top official in the leadership in the Northern District of Florida as a prosecutor.
[00:47:21.281 --> 00:47:23.963]  He currently works at the Beggs and Lane Law Firm.
[00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:25.144]  As a matter of fact,
[00:47:25.504 --> 00:47:48.369]  One of the recordings that was made at the FBI and Department of Justice request occurred at that law firm, and the money that was supposed to be paid today that would have shown even more evidence of David McGee's work in this extortion scheme, that was foiled by the New York Times story, and I believe that's why this horrible information and these terrible allegations have been used this evening.
[00:47:50.288 --> 00:47:57.615]  So you're, and I'll get to the investigation in a sec, but you're saying that David McGee was motivated by greed.
[00:47:57.655 --> 00:47:59.697]  He was trying to extort money from your family.
[00:47:59.757 --> 00:48:01.338]  That's his motivation, you're saying.
[00:48:02.443 --> 00:48:02.963]  I don't know.
[00:48:22.312 --> 00:48:25.313]  We're going to talk about this with Roger Stone on the other side.
[00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:30.674]  I think Gates looks extremely credible, and on a scale of 1 to 10, for looking confident and telling the truth, that's about a 9.9.
[00:48:30.854 --> 00:48:36.056]  I mean, even if you're totally innocent, you still feel a little guilty when you're accused of something.
[00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:37.236]  He looks completely innocent.
[00:48:37.276 --> 00:48:42.317]  I've never seen somebody look so innocent, and I'm not in the business here of kissing Congressman Matt Gates' ass.
[00:48:42.357 --> 00:48:47.019]  I'm just telling you, my BS meter says no BS here whatsoever.
[00:48:47.399 --> 00:48:48.939]  But I have some inside baseball, though.
[00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.080]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.280]  The guy's a playboy.
[00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.283]  And so, is there something true?
[00:48:54.323 --> 00:48:56.264]  There's something that they're trying to pin in there.
[00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:59.925]  We'll talk about it with Roger Stone straight ahead in 60 seconds.
[00:48:59.945 --> 00:49:00.345]  We'll be back.
[00:49:01.706 --> 00:49:06.607]  All right, the big story, not just here but around the world, is Congressman Matt Gaetz.
[00:49:06.627 --> 00:49:07.208]  He's smart.
[00:49:07.248 --> 00:49:07.848]  He's hardcore.
[00:49:07.868 --> 00:49:08.628]  He's pro-America.
[00:49:09.048 --> 00:49:09.729]  He's got courage.
[00:49:09.769 --> 00:49:10.909]  He fights for the Second Amendment.
[00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:12.350]  He fights for sovereignty.
[00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:18.032]  He was at the tip of the spear exposing election fraud and the fact that they overblew what happened at the Capitol.
[00:49:18.692 --> 00:49:24.116]  No, he's definitely an up-and-comer, major presidential material, not now, but in 10 years or so.
[00:49:24.936 --> 00:49:31.040]  And so he's one of the main targets, along with Ted Cruz, along with Rand Paul, around with Jim Jordan.
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.342]  I mean, he's right up there at the top of the hit list, only under Donald Trump.
[00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:38.585]  And I'd say Alex Jones, not for me running for president, but just wanting people's heads.
[00:49:38.605 --> 00:49:44.509]  Oh, and there's one other guy up there at the top, not that we like being on this list, that's Roger Stone for the headhunters out there.
[00:49:44.769 --> 00:49:46.430]  So he's good friends with Gates, goes way back.
[00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:47.771]  He got Gates on the show before.
[00:49:48.672 --> 00:49:51.275]  Uh, it's like Donald Trump said, I'm here because Roger Stone got me on, by the way.
[00:49:51.316 --> 00:49:52.858]  Gates is like, I'm here because Roger Stone got me on.
[00:49:53.479 --> 00:49:55.141]  And so you see this.
[00:49:55.161 --> 00:49:56.002]  So I made some calls.
[00:49:56.043 --> 00:50:00.890]  Well, I actually got some calls and I made some calls, people that know Gates well, some big, big, big people.
[00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:01.911]  And they said no.
[00:50:02.927 --> 00:50:04.048]  Gates is a playboy.
[00:50:04.269 --> 00:50:05.670]  Gates doesn't like underage women.
[00:50:06.071 --> 00:50:08.433]  Gates has never hid this, that he's single and young.
[00:50:09.194 --> 00:50:11.757]  And he's not even, he doesn't even know if any of this is true.
[00:50:12.037 --> 00:50:13.859]  He doesn't, didn't fly with some underage woman.
[00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:14.660]  That's made up.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.322]  This is a shakedown.
[00:50:16.842 --> 00:50:21.567]  But the question is, do they have some woman who can claim that, well, she was younger.
[00:50:21.587 --> 00:50:24.691]  Now she's, you know, 20 something that she went out with him three years ago.
[00:50:25.671 --> 00:50:34.637]  But definitely he went to the FBI, definitely it's a shakedown, and I know Roger Stone has had his ear to the ground and been making some phone calls to give us the latest here today.
[00:50:34.737 --> 00:50:47.726]  So, former political president, pardoned by the president, an innocent man, an American patriot, Roger Stone joins us next up in the gallows, next up at the guillotine, very popular Florida up-and-comer Matt Gaetz.
[00:50:47.826 --> 00:50:49.287]  What is the inside poopoo?
[00:50:53.595 --> 00:51:02.881]  I mean, if you had to name the single most effective member of the House in terms of fighting for the America First agenda, it would have to be Matt Gaetz.
[00:51:03.442 --> 00:51:12.928]  It's not incidental that right here on this show, only weeks ago, I mentioned him very realistically as a presidential contender.
[00:51:13.388 --> 00:51:16.230]  So this is a search and destroy mission.
[00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:20.371]  I know Matt Gaetz to be a person of extraordinary integrity.
[00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:22.751]  He was a playboy.
[00:51:22.951 --> 00:51:28.312]  He is now engaged to a wonderful woman, Ginger, who I've met several times.
[00:51:28.512 --> 00:51:29.692]  They're very much in love.
[00:51:30.092 --> 00:51:31.853]  This is not the Matt Gaetz that I know.
[00:51:31.913 --> 00:51:34.113]  This is a cheap political trick.
[00:51:34.473 --> 00:51:36.874]  This is an effort to derail his career.
[00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:43.395]  Folks don't know this, but Matt Gaetz's family is among the wealthiest families in Florida.
[00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:48.977]  Therefore, the motive of extortion of blackmail is a very realistic one.
[00:51:49.897 --> 00:51:51.878]  But I agree with your analysis.
[00:51:52.098 --> 00:52:00.480]  I saw the congressman looking very confident, very upbeat, very much on the attack, not looking like a whipped puppy.
[00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.982]  And I'd like to see them release those tapes.
[00:52:04.162 --> 00:52:05.682]  See, that's the key.
[00:52:06.062 --> 00:52:10.844]  I think the tapes that I understand were made with the supervision of the FBI.
[00:52:11.844 --> 00:52:22.548]  Of former federal prosecutors trying to shake down Matt Gaetz and his father, who by the way is a former president of the Florida State Senate, very respected in this state.
[00:52:23.668 --> 00:52:27.450]  I believe that the FBI has the proof that will set Matt Gaetz free.
[00:52:28.596 --> 00:52:36.203]  Exactly, and they knew that the globalists, the Democrats, the Democrat Justice Department was about to be embarrassed by all of this.
[00:52:36.223 --> 00:52:47.453]  So the New York Times did damage control, showing they've got operatives in that local FBI office that knew that good agents were about to close the jaws, the trap on this guy.
[00:52:48.871 --> 00:52:50.793]  Well, let's be very clear.
[00:52:50.853 --> 00:52:55.617]  Washington operates, particularly in the last four years, on the basis of harmful leaks.
[00:52:56.217 --> 00:52:57.959]  Those leaks don't even have to be true.
[00:52:58.539 --> 00:53:06.226]  They'll end up on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post or on CNN or MSNBC, whether they're true or not.
[00:53:06.566 --> 00:53:08.227]  And therefore, they do damage.
[00:53:08.327 --> 00:53:09.708]  And that's exactly the point here.
[00:53:10.089 --> 00:53:11.210]  They're trying to destroy
[00:53:12.486 --> 00:53:19.050]  A guy who I think may be the young, great, conservative hope for the America First movement.
[00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:22.032]  People say, oh, he's too young to run for president.
[00:53:22.112 --> 00:53:28.295]  Actually, if he ran in 2024, he'd be older than Jack Kennedy when he became president.
[00:53:28.735 --> 00:53:30.877]  So, look, I think it has to do with courage.
[00:53:30.897 --> 00:53:32.337]  It has to do with talent.
[00:53:32.658 --> 00:53:33.938]  This is the- Well, he definitely has that.
[00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:34.559]  Let's be clear.
[00:53:34.599 --> 00:53:39.562]  We're not going to, you know, kiss and tell here, but Tucker legitimately isn't running for the media.
[00:53:40.302 --> 00:53:41.905]  They're not in competition with each other.
[00:53:42.205 --> 00:53:46.111]  Tucker's not against Trump for some reasons because he wants to be president.
[00:53:46.151 --> 00:53:50.137]  Tucker is not running for president, cannot stand it, will never go back to D.C.
[00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:52.380]  Tucker Carlson is not running for president.
[00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:54.504]  Why don't you explain that to people that don't seem to get that?
[00:53:55.697 --> 00:53:57.259]  Yeah, look, I love Tucker Carlson.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.229]  He played a huge role in telling the American people the truth about the Soviet-style show trial that I was subjected to.
[00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:08.635]  But he just has no interest in elective politics.
[00:54:08.675 --> 00:54:09.616]  He's a journalist.
[00:54:09.977 --> 00:54:12.621]  He was a print journalist, a very fine print journalist.
[00:54:13.001 --> 00:54:16.744]  He probably has the number one cable TV show in the world right now.
[00:54:17.245 --> 00:54:21.068]  He has an enormous following because he lays it right on you.
[00:54:21.449 --> 00:54:28.755]  Yeah, he's a populist, but just to be clear, Gates is the only smart guy with tenacity that has a shot other than Trump.
[00:54:28.775 --> 00:54:29.736]  That's what you told me privately.
[00:54:29.956 --> 00:54:36.201]  You said in the interview that's gone viral that we shot at your offices there at the Nixon Museum outside Miami just a few weeks ago.
[00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:38.984]  I mean, literally, it's Trump or Gates.
[00:54:39.084 --> 00:54:39.925]  It's Trump or Gates.
[00:54:41.192 --> 00:54:46.673]  Well, look, I like General Flynn, and I have huge respect for him, but I don't know that he's going to run for president.
[00:54:47.073 --> 00:54:49.094]  I'm also impressed with Josh Hawley.
[00:54:50.194 --> 00:54:53.895]  As I said on this very show, if the president runs, I'm for Donald Trump.
[00:54:53.935 --> 00:54:55.375]  Let's be very clear about that.
[00:54:55.836 --> 00:54:59.356]  If the president didn't run, yeah, Matt Gaetz would have to be at the top.
[00:54:59.396 --> 00:54:59.676]  Oh, I agree.
[00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.557]  A Hawley-Gaetz ticket would be powerful.
[00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:06.007]  Well, look, who is it that Adam Schiff despises the most?
[00:55:06.528 --> 00:55:08.809]  Who is it that Jerry Nadler can't stand?
[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:13.493]  Who is the guy who calls Eric Swalwell to task constantly?
[00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:14.794]  Why, it's Matt Gaetz.
[00:55:15.154 --> 00:55:17.035]  The guy has enormous cojones.
[00:55:17.075 --> 00:55:18.536]  He's got huge courage.
[00:55:19.057 --> 00:55:25.901]  You know, usually when you're young and you first get to Congress, they tell you to... Oh yeah, he has incredible charisma.
[00:55:25.941 --> 00:55:26.702]  He's super smart.
[00:55:26.762 --> 00:55:28.883]  Definitely, they sense the alpha male.
[00:55:28.903 --> 00:55:29.404]  They're scared.
[00:55:30.421 --> 00:55:33.082]  Yeah, because he has many of the same traits as Trump.
[00:55:33.422 --> 00:55:34.263]  He's audacious.
[00:55:34.563 --> 00:55:35.303]  He's bold.
[00:55:35.403 --> 00:55:36.224]  He's a brawler.
[00:55:36.744 --> 00:55:39.045]  They don't want to take another beating like they took in 2016.
[00:55:40.065 --> 00:55:41.586]  So I think this is payback.
[00:55:41.926 --> 00:55:43.547]  I think it is politically motivated.
[00:55:44.628 --> 00:55:48.349]  I hate to see what it is doing to his family, but he's doing the right thing.
[00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:53.892]  Let's get all the facts on the table before we judge this great patriot.
[00:55:54.512 --> 00:55:58.635]  Well, I mean, we know from, I mean, he doesn't even know what they're talking about.
[00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:00.016]  He was on the plane with no woman.
[00:56:00.376 --> 00:56:00.936]  It's made up.
[00:56:00.956 --> 00:56:06.279]  The New York Times, just the same one that lied about WMDs in Iraq, is the same one telling us this lie.
[00:56:06.299 --> 00:56:08.241]  And when do they get held accountable, Roger?
[00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:10.262]  They lie about you, they lie about me, they lie about Trump.
[00:56:10.662 --> 00:56:11.723]  And it just gets worse.
[00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.964]  I mean, it gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:56:14.024 --> 00:56:15.405]  I'm wondering what's coming next.
[00:56:15.445 --> 00:56:19.888]  I mean, I reached out to the paper all the time that has no connection to reality.
[00:56:21.175 --> 00:56:23.257]  Yeah, like, say, The Guardian, for example.
[00:56:23.277 --> 00:56:24.818]  I think these people are on drugs.
[00:56:24.858 --> 00:56:26.019]  I mean, they're delusional.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:33.586]  Look, how many news outlets have told you that I'm the mastermind behind the January 6th storming of the Capitol?
[00:56:33.626 --> 00:56:38.050]  When, firstly, I know nothing whatsoever about it, and secondarily, I wasn't there.
[00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:43.335]  But it's an article of faith among a bunch of leftists who, you know, push it in their headline.
[00:56:44.436 --> 00:56:45.737]  This is the same kind of thing.
[00:56:45.797 --> 00:56:57.046]  So, Roger Stone is connected to a local Republican official named Joel Greenberg, who is connected to Matt Gaetz, who is connected to Jacob Engels, the crusading journalist.
[00:56:57.807 --> 00:57:03.932]  It's all guilt by association, but I'm convinced at the end of the day, Matt Gaetz has done nothing wrong.
[00:57:04.312 --> 00:57:06.374]  And we're going to get a chance to find that out.
[00:57:06.434 --> 00:57:07.975]  We're going to get a chance to prove that.
[00:57:08.295 --> 00:57:14.700]  We cannot let them destroy one of the leading and most promising young conservative fighters in the country.
[00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:17.923]  Well, that leads me to this next point we'll cover next segment.
[00:57:18.623 --> 00:57:24.028]  I think Gates should say, I wasn't on Lolita Express with Bill and Bill Gates.
[00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:25.509]  You got the wrong Gates.
[00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:31.454]  He should come out and expose and talk about all the news that is surfacing
[00:57:32.134 --> 00:57:32.514]  I think so.
[00:57:50.848 --> 00:57:52.789]  Congressman Gates starts playing hardball.
[00:57:52.809 --> 00:57:53.229]  Here's another one.
[00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:57.730]  Woman claims Epstein raped her in front of her son, threatened to feed her to alligators.
[00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:01.232]  I mean, you say I'm with underage people with no proof?
[00:58:01.592 --> 00:58:02.692]  No, you're the ones.
[00:58:02.732 --> 00:58:03.672]  He needs to go on the attack.
[00:58:03.712 --> 00:58:04.153]  What do you say?
[00:58:05.013 --> 00:58:10.935]  Well, I would like to see Hunter Biden get the same treatment that Matt Gaetz is getting today.
[00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:24.247]  I believe, based on what I've seen, it's far more likely that the charges of sex with underage children with Hunter Biden is far more credible and more likely true than these totally phony allegations.
[00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:24.707]  Well, that's right.
[00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:25.647]  Hunter with his niece.
[00:58:25.687 --> 00:58:27.628]  Hell, that's on the laptop and the gun, all of it.
[00:58:27.848 --> 00:58:30.850]  Let's talk about with Roger Stone, how Gates goes on the offense.
[00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:33.471]  How Matt Gates destroys them with this.
[00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:42.734]  Alright folks, you're tuned in to the number one target of The Globalist because we have the guest on and let you hear what's happening unfiltered.
[00:58:43.495 --> 00:58:47.998]  I can tell you that obviously we've talked to sources very close to Gates, about as close as you can get.
[00:58:49.299 --> 00:58:51.261]  As close as you can get.
[00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:54.323]  And I can tell you we've talked to people in the media that have dug into this heavily.
[00:58:56.124 --> 00:59:03.269]  Gates has no memory of any woman, never with any underage, no women flying with him that weren't girlfriends on record that he had for a long time.
[00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:04.110]  He's now engaged.
[00:59:05.011 --> 00:59:07.754]  This is total crap because he's on their ass and they're scared of him.
[00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:11.437]  And Roger's made some calls, I was talking to him during the break, he's confirmed that.
[00:59:12.338 --> 00:59:13.720]  I see this as a huge opportunity.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.282]  The left can't silence a Matt Gaetz.
[00:59:16.983 --> 00:59:27.714]  They can try to silence me or Roger Stone, but he can go on Fox News, anywhere, and say, wait a minute, I'm not on the plane like Bill Clinton with underage girls to a slave island.
[00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:30.715]  I'm not Anthony Weiner.
[00:59:31.257 --> 00:59:32.962]  I'm not Chuck Schumer protecting him.
[00:59:33.744 --> 00:59:36.532]  I'm not what's in the WikiLeaks with Tony Podesta.
[00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:37.014]  I think...
[00:59:38.956 --> 00:59:40.498]  He should go on the offense.
[00:59:40.518 --> 00:59:41.879]  I mean, here's a National File article.
[00:59:42.219 --> 00:59:46.564]  Matt Gaetz attacks sex-trafficking allegations as being part of organized criminal extortion.
[00:59:46.864 --> 00:59:47.805]  He went to the FBI.
[00:59:47.845 --> 00:59:48.246]  He did it.
[00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:55.353]  And then secondarily, Roger, he should say, I want a criminal investigation of who leaked this from the FBI to the New York Times.
[00:59:55.373 --> 00:59:57.836]  We were about to sting these people and bust them.
[00:59:59.157 --> 01:00:00.599]  To me, he needs to go on the offense.
[01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.640]  What does Roger Stone say?
[01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.555]  No Alex, that's absolutely right.
[01:00:04.776 --> 01:00:09.723]  I think people need to understand how both illegal and insidious these leaks are.
[01:00:10.339 --> 01:00:25.406]  So, for example, when I was arrested on January 25th, 2019, and 29 heavily armed FBI agents were storming my house, as you know, CNN was 25 feet away with a camera.
[01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:30.648]  Perfect example of the same kind of illegal leak that is designed to damage you.
[01:00:31.148 --> 01:00:33.209]  These leaks aren't based on facts.
[01:00:33.269 --> 01:00:34.110]  They're baseless.
[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.191]  They don't cite any evidence to support them.
[01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:39.032]  It's character assassination.
[01:00:39.432 --> 01:00:39.833]  Why?
[01:00:40.193 --> 01:00:41.374]  Because it's payback.
[01:00:42.114 --> 01:00:51.942]  This is the only guy who took the Democrats on frontally, in impeachment, on Ukraine, on all of their nonsensical efforts to take down Donald Trump.
[01:00:52.343 --> 01:01:01.230]  So the number one defender of Donald Trump, the one guy who's not afraid to get in the face of a Jake Tapper or Jerry Nadler, is Matt Gaetz.
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:07.735]  He's got enormous courage and that's why they're trying to destroy him with the series of unspecified
[01:01:08.595 --> 01:01:14.657]  And I agree.
[01:01:17.738 --> 01:01:19.679]  You've been there for decades and got out of it.
[01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:22.680]  Instead of always groveling, he should go on the warpath.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.801]  I mean, he has the bully pulpit right now.
[01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:31.843]  He has the Democrats up their eyeballs at sex trafficking, the open border, Senate report about Obama, and now Biden's sex trafficking kids.
[01:01:31.883 --> 01:01:36.725]  I mean, he should go absolutely ape instead of, I mean, he's denouncing it in a great way.
[01:01:37.725 --> 01:01:39.949]  Well, once again, we have the exact same double standard.
[01:01:53.371 --> 01:02:21.301]  Congressman Eric Swalwell, who for two solid years insisted that I was a traitor to my country, that I was a Russian asset, we now know, without dispute, was involved in a romantic affair with a red Chinese spy, and that she was able to penetrate his office and put an intern in there, which is significant because Swalwell has access to classified information as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:02:21.964 --> 01:02:24.299]  I believe the Congressman is guilty of treason!
[01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:27.315]  Uh, just as he said, I was guilty of treason.
[01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:29.335]  The difference is, he was wrong.
[01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:31.696]  Yet, this guy is still sitting on the committee.
[01:02:31.996 --> 01:02:43.840]  He is unpunished, yet we have baseless accusations against Matt Gaetz with no backup, no documentation whatsoever, and the media is off to the races.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:49.661]  Meanwhile, Eric Clowell may be giving away our top secrets to the Red Chinese, even as we speak.
[01:02:49.701 --> 01:02:52.362]  And that's all confirmed, and he's still on the Intelligence Committee.
[01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.003]  Let that sink in.
[01:02:54.123 --> 01:02:54.263]  So,
[01:02:55.043 --> 01:02:56.484]  I'm going to play this clip in a moment, guys.
[01:02:56.524 --> 01:02:56.924]  Cue it up.
[01:02:57.605 --> 01:03:03.249]  It's the only time the words Eric Swalwell and intelligence are used in the same sentence, actually.
[01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.451]  What is wrong with Swalwell?
[01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:08.733]  Why do the Democrats defend him when he's so stupid?
[01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:12.276]  And so he says he wants to use nuclear weapons on American gun owners.
[01:03:12.696 --> 01:03:14.357]  Why would they put such an idiot up there?
[01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:15.278]  Well, what's going on with that?
[01:03:15.919 --> 01:03:18.241]  Well, he's a personal favor of the Speaker.
[01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:19.001]  That's why.
[01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:24.405]  That's how he's gotten his committee assignments and how he survived.
[01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:31.709]  Let's face it, if he were a Republican and we found out that he was sleeping with, say, I don't know, a Russian spy, he'd be in jail by now.
[01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:34.591]  But there's a different standard for Democrats.
[01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:39.555]  They can use the full authority and the intelligence capabilities of the U.S.
[01:03:39.575 --> 01:03:42.977]  government to spy on their political opponents with impunity.
[01:03:43.417 --> 01:03:45.819]  When Richard Nixon did it, they ran him out of town.
[01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.742]  When Barack Obama and Joe Biden did it, the media just denies it.
[01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:52.444]  Nixon stuck his toe in the pool.
[01:03:52.464 --> 01:03:54.165]  They are in the deep end at the bottom.
[01:03:54.505 --> 01:03:55.045]  They're fine.
[01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:56.066]  I'm going to play you this clip.
[01:03:56.526 --> 01:03:57.867]  Biden is degenerating.
[01:03:57.927 --> 01:03:58.748]  He's falling apart.
[01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:01.090]  He doesn't know who he is faster than we even thought.
[01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.352]  And then meanwhile, they scream at reporters, treat them like animals.
[01:04:04.432 --> 01:04:06.614]  If Trump did this, it'd be the end of the world.
[01:04:06.914 --> 01:04:08.255]  I mean, everything about
[01:04:08.795 --> 01:04:12.096]  The Biden administration is like a bar closing down at 2am.
[01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.336]  It's dysfunctional.
[01:04:13.776 --> 01:04:14.836]  It's the wheels are off.
[01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:15.917]  It's out of control.
[01:04:16.297 --> 01:04:18.897]  They look like they're in over their head.
[01:04:20.137 --> 01:04:23.818]  Here's a clip yesterday of them just screaming at reporters to just get out.
[01:04:23.878 --> 01:04:24.318]  Here it is.
[01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:32.000]  Thanks, folks.
[01:04:48.954 --> 01:04:51.936]  Alright, so you were just watching the president... This is happening everywhere.
[01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:54.697]  It's just... What the hell is going on up there, Roger?
[01:04:54.717 --> 01:04:57.619]  Look, it's absolute chaos.
[01:04:57.659 --> 01:05:04.524]  The most amazing thing about the president last week was accusing the Republicans and Donald Trump of Jim Crow.
[01:05:05.228 --> 01:05:05.568]  Really?
[01:05:05.588 --> 01:05:23.146]  The guy who wrote the legislation that requires the harsh mandatory penalties for the first time non-violent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs that has fallen disproportionately on black people and people of color that has destroyed hundreds of thousands if not millions of black lives today?
[01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:24.287]  That guy?
[01:05:24.307 --> 01:05:25.608]  The guy who said that
[01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:32.594]  That if they desegregated the Delaware, the Wilmington, Delaware public schools, it would be like a racial jungle?
[01:05:32.935 --> 01:05:35.177]  And he didn't want his daughter going to school in a jungle?
[01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:37.819]  He's the original original segregationist.
[01:05:38.139 --> 01:05:40.961]  He's the guy who's used dog whistle throughout his career.
[01:05:41.222 --> 01:05:46.967]  But then to say, if you want to use a photo ID in order to vote in Georgia, that's racist.
[01:05:47.427 --> 01:05:48.388]  No, it isn't racist.
[01:05:48.488 --> 01:05:49.529]  It's common sense.
[01:05:50.296 --> 01:05:50.856]  I agree with you.
[01:05:50.877 --> 01:05:52.618]  I want to hit some other issues when we come back.
[01:05:52.678 --> 01:05:53.939]  But how long?
[01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:58.062]  You and I got criticized two years ago during the campaign saying Biden's had another stroke.
[01:05:58.102 --> 01:06:00.303]  He's going to be senile if he gets in office.
[01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:01.424]  We've been proven right.
[01:06:01.484 --> 01:06:02.525]  Now that's mainline news.
[01:06:02.885 --> 01:06:03.626]  Just in one minute.
[01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:04.847]  Gut level.
[01:06:05.047 --> 01:06:06.088]  How does this end for Biden?
[01:06:07.698 --> 01:06:08.698]  I think not well.
[01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.539]  Look, I actually feel sorry for the guy.
[01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.640]  I think he's being used.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.100]  Some days he doesn't even appear to know where he is.
[01:06:16.061 --> 01:06:18.662]  So I don't wish him any ill will, none at all.
[01:06:19.402 --> 01:06:21.042]  I'd like to see the country prosper.
[01:06:21.382 --> 01:06:32.206]  I was actually happy when he didn't bite upon the minimum wage socialist proposal and when he stuck to his guns on the means test for the COVID-19 relief package.
[01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:50.714]  That doesn't make him a conservative, folks, because given the immigration problem, given our gasoline prices, given the unequal protection of the American people, where immigrants can come into the country without being tested for COVID, but try leaving on vacation and flying back into the United States as a citizen.
[01:06:51.014 --> 01:06:51.434]  Exactly.
[01:06:51.534 --> 01:06:51.914]  Stay there.
[01:06:51.954 --> 01:06:53.775]  I want to talk about that because I had that feeling this morning.
[01:06:53.795 --> 01:06:55.396]  I'm in the shower, washing my hair, and I'm like,
[01:06:56.056 --> 01:06:57.436]  I hate Biden failing.
[01:06:57.477 --> 01:06:58.257]  He's so pathetic.
[01:06:58.277 --> 01:06:59.217]  It makes me feel bad.
[01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:03.358]  Even though I hate his guts, it's this weird paradox of, I wish he was good.
[01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:04.899]  I wish he was together.
[01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:06.659]  It's so disheartening.
[01:07:06.819 --> 01:07:07.820]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.740]  We'll cover it all.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.821]  The Open Borders and more on the other side.
[01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:11.301]  Stay with us.
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:35.945]  Alright, I was talking to Roger during the break and he said, listen, I've got marching orders, what I think is a long-term truth teller about what Congressman Matt Gaetz, under extortion, under deep state attack, under controlled Justice Department siege by O'Biden, that's what I call him, I keep calling him Obama, he's O'Biden, he's the puppet of Obama, the third term of Obama.
[01:07:36.025 --> 01:07:39.267]  What is your message to embattled Congressman Matt Gaetz?
[01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:47.664]  The most important message is that Congressman Gates, in this kind of a maelstrom, must put his faith in Jesus Christ.
[01:07:48.304 --> 01:08:07.934]  You know, Alex, I was shocked last night to learn that Alice Butler Short, one of the finest women I've ever known, a real spark plug, I mean, one of the most important activists in the entire America First movement, crucial in the nomination of Donald Trump, passed away suddenly two days ago, about a day ago.
[01:08:08.995 --> 01:08:12.199]  She was the first woman who sought me out at the U.S.
[01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:24.395]  District Courthouse in D.C., drove downtown to find me, to give me a Bible and tell me to put my faith in Jesus, that I would be saved if I would return to the church of my forebears.
[01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:25.676]  She was right.
[01:08:26.096 --> 01:08:32.463]  So Matt Gaetz must take solace in his belief in God because he's in for one hell of a battle.
[01:08:33.223 --> 01:08:37.988]  But the Lord will never desert him and will never fail to protect him.
[01:08:38.048 --> 01:08:41.011]  Secondarily, he needs to go on offense.
[01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:43.514]  This is right up front in Stone's rules.
[01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:54.798]  The left-wing, non-journalist, fake news media are the most vicious, malicious, dishonest people that I've ever come across.
[01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:58.299]  This is not as it was 20 years ago in politics.
[01:08:58.619 --> 01:09:09.763]  You have a new breed of these hardcore, snotty left-wingers calling themselves reporters when they in fact are children, and they have no ethics whatsoever.
[01:09:10.343 --> 01:09:14.986]  All of these stories that are maligning Matt Gaetz today are based on leaks.
[01:09:15.546 --> 01:09:16.266]  Where's the beef?
[01:09:16.706 --> 01:09:17.507]  Where are the facts?
[01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:19.428]  I don't think there are any facts.
[01:09:19.748 --> 01:09:27.632]  I think this is a good old-fashioned smear because, let's face it, Matt Gaetz shows enormous promise and they know that.
[01:09:27.932 --> 01:09:32.274]  They don't want to face him at the polls in four years or eight years or 12 years.
[01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:35.136]  They want to finish his political career right now.
[01:09:35.516 --> 01:09:37.637]  Not because he's done something wrong, because I don't
[01:09:37.637 --> 01:09:43.019]  I don't believe he has, but because they control the media, they now control the Justice Department.
[01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:44.880]  That's a toxic combination.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.100]  I agree.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:46.900]  Spend a few minutes.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.961]  How does he go on offense?
[01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:52.523]  He brings up the Clintons and the other gates on the Lita Express 20-something times.
[01:09:52.903 --> 01:09:54.543]  He brings up the Justice Department covering it up.
[01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:57.144]  He brings up Weiner.
[01:09:57.244 --> 01:09:58.345]  He brings up WikiLeaks.
[01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:01.326]  He brings up that they're the ones that do all this, not him.
[01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:02.386]  He's pro-life.
[01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:04.367]  They want to kill babies, not just rape them.
[01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:09.820]  Well, look, those I think are what the left refers to as me-tooism.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.321]  He does need to do that to set the table.
[01:10:12.401 --> 01:10:17.604]  In other words, is he being treated as Hunter Biden was treated when serious allegations were made against him?
[01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.145]  No, those were swept under the table.
[01:10:20.565 --> 01:10:26.448]  No, but the truth here is Matt Gaetz knows the facts of what he's being accused of.
[01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.309]  He knows how this has been fabricated.
[01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:31.891]  I think he should not go hide in a hole.
[01:10:31.991 --> 01:10:34.632]  He should be out there like he was on Tucker last night.
[01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:36.174]  Telling the truth.
[01:10:36.294 --> 01:10:37.435]  Laying it out for people.
[01:10:37.755 --> 01:10:41.280]  But most importantly, let's hear the tapes.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.602]  We need to hear the tapes.
[01:10:43.622 --> 01:10:43.883]  That's right.
[01:10:43.923 --> 01:10:45.925]  The key is, he went to the FBI.
[01:10:46.005 --> 01:10:46.946]  They had a sting up.
[01:10:47.206 --> 01:10:48.888]  They were about to bust him yesterday.
[01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:52.873]  Somebody in the FBI leaked that info to the New York Times for damage control.
[01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:55.036]  Gates was about to have a devastating victory.
[01:10:56.321 --> 01:10:57.622]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:10:57.822 --> 01:11:00.464]  So the bottom line to this is very simple.
[01:11:01.064 --> 01:11:03.546]  Evidence exists that will sort this whole thing out.
[01:11:04.006 --> 01:11:07.848]  Evidence exists that I believe will bear out everything Matt Gaetz has said.
[01:11:08.168 --> 01:11:10.890]  That this is in good old-fashioned extortion play.
[01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:22.758]  A high-stakes leak in the Justice Department has left information in the hands of a former prosecutor or prosecutors who now seek to line their pockets.
[01:11:23.118 --> 01:11:25.099]  That's a very serious crime.
[01:11:25.566 --> 01:11:28.249]  And the congressman needs to remain on offense.
[01:11:28.649 --> 01:11:29.590]  Tell the truth.
[01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:32.873]  The best way to win this fight is simply tell the truth.
[01:11:33.173 --> 01:11:34.995]  I think he began doing that last night.
[01:11:35.456 --> 01:11:39.379]  I'm going to be out there defending him because I think he's being unfairly treated.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.401]  I know a little bit about that.
[01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:43.223]  This is a machine.
[01:11:43.523 --> 01:11:44.925]  This chews you up.
[01:11:45.986 --> 01:11:47.087]  It doesn't have to be true.
[01:11:47.147 --> 01:11:48.247]  It's all allegation.
[01:11:48.848 --> 01:11:50.089]  It's all innuendo.
[01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:52.070]  It's all guilt by association.
[01:11:52.471 --> 01:11:56.514]  And once again, they correctly see Matt Gaetz is a superstar.
[01:11:56.874 --> 01:12:04.060]  This guy is a future leader of the movement that produced Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, and they're scared to death about him.
[01:12:04.704 --> 01:12:09.305]  That's right, they're trying to destroy anybody that could lead us out of this garbage, and he's shown courage.
[01:12:09.385 --> 01:12:18.047]  The election fraud, the open borders, the attacks on Trump, they are absolutely scared of Gates and trying to destroy him, and it's going to fail.
[01:12:18.127 --> 01:12:24.528]  I'm just so sick of the New York Times and the Washington Post, even the Wall Street Journal, as you said, they're the worst, getting away with outright lies.
[01:12:24.568 --> 01:12:28.809]  I mean, they print stuff every week about you and I that are damn 100% lies.
[01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:34.928]  It's Kafkaesque, it's so bizarre.
[01:12:35.388 --> 01:12:43.371]  I actually got an email from Michael Schmidt, the reporter at the New York Times that wrote this story today.
[01:12:43.751 --> 01:12:48.192]  I'm going to be releasing my response because it is quite extraordinary.
[01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:53.674]  They don't hold the New York Times to the same standards they hold everybody else to.
[01:12:54.034 --> 01:12:59.976]  It is a maze of linked to, associated with, is known to have spent time with.
[01:13:00.216 --> 01:13:01.317]  That's guilt by association.
[01:13:01.337 --> 01:13:02.097]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:13:02.938 --> 01:13:03.739]  I want the exclusive.
[01:13:03.759 --> 01:13:04.539]  Can you pull up the email?
[01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:05.920]  I want to hear your response to The New York Times.
[01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:09.283]  Uh, yeah, you'll get a chance to take a look at it.
[01:13:09.543 --> 01:13:13.506]  I've got to touch it up a little bit because the more I read it, the angrier I get.
[01:13:13.526 --> 01:13:16.548]  Will you come on The War Room today and give us the exclusive, please?
[01:13:17.369 --> 01:13:19.090]  If I can stay awake that long, sure.
[01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:20.912]  I know, you haven't seen a write all night.
[01:13:20.992 --> 01:13:25.255]  Roger, I have to apologize to you, and I've done this a lot, but when I'm wrong, I want to be wrong.
[01:13:26.317 --> 01:13:31.275]  I made fun of you, I laughed at you, I yelled at you when you were worried about being indicted for being a Russian.
[01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:33.923]  Because I knew I was there with the whole WikiLeaks thing.
[01:13:33.963 --> 01:13:34.784]  They wouldn't talk to us.
[01:13:34.804 --> 01:13:35.464]  None of it was true.
[01:13:35.805 --> 01:13:36.385]  None of it happened.
[01:13:36.425 --> 01:13:37.366]  And then you got indicted.
[01:13:37.646 --> 01:13:38.466]  Now I'm not laughing.
[01:13:38.506 --> 01:13:41.549]  They are rubbing their hands together in hundreds of articles a week.
[01:13:41.869 --> 01:13:43.570]  Just, we're going to arrest Jones and Stone.
[01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:44.631]  They're going to prison.
[01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:45.311]  We're going to get them.
[01:13:46.392 --> 01:13:48.193]  Oh, we attacked the Capitol with no evidence.
[01:13:48.393 --> 01:13:49.174]  Of course we didn't do that.
[01:13:49.494 --> 01:13:52.236]  These people, I've learned, they don't care.
[01:13:52.316 --> 01:13:52.917]  They're crazy.
[01:13:52.937 --> 01:13:54.958]  I mean, they don't care what's true.
[01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.019]  They don't even care there's evidence.
[01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:57.807]  That's exactly right.
[01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:02.205]  So let's talk about the single most important thing the InfoWarriors can do at this moment.
[01:14:02.757 --> 01:14:05.399]  And that is to pray for Matt Gaetz and his family.
[01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:09.941]  Pray for Congressman Matt Gaetz and his fiancée.
[01:14:10.562 --> 01:14:11.502]  He's a good man.
[01:14:11.562 --> 01:14:14.304]  He's being maligned because he stands for the U.S.
[01:14:14.364 --> 01:14:18.006]  Constitution and he's had no fear of these left-wing bullies.
[01:14:18.406 --> 01:14:19.607]  This is a smear.
[01:14:20.027 --> 01:14:20.948]  It is outrageous.
[01:14:21.188 --> 01:14:22.108]  It is repugnant.
[01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.369]  Hold on.
[01:14:22.409 --> 01:14:23.249]  You just said the key.
[01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:25.571]  They hate the fact that he doesn't have fear.
[01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.592]  And I instinctively don't have it.
[01:14:27.652 --> 01:14:28.432]  You don't have it either.
[01:14:28.512 --> 01:14:29.333]  It's this thing where
[01:14:30.690 --> 01:14:31.532]  I don't get scared.
[01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:34.759]  I mean, I get concerned, but they smell our fear, don't they?
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:40.584]  That's exactly right, and they challenge anybody who they think is going to point out the truth.
[01:14:41.484 --> 01:14:47.349]  Roger, I know for real, because I've talked to you privately, I see the tears in your eyes when we've been in person, when you were saying pray with me, you start crying.
[01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:50.671]  You were always a Christian, but you got led astray, none of us are perfect, God forgive us all.
[01:14:50.691 --> 01:14:55.635]  You had a little bit of partying here and there, and none of it was wrong, in God's eyes, because you repented of it, like King David.
[01:14:55.955 --> 01:14:56.796]  But let's pray.
[01:14:56.816 --> 01:15:01.039]  We've got a minute and a half left to break, but lead us in prayer for Congressman Matt Gaetz, please.
[01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.101]  Look, I'm not the most articulate, but I'll give it a try.
[01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:16.189]  Dear Lord, you who created both heaven and earth, you who stand for justice and hate injustice, please watch over Matt Gaetz in this struggle for his freedom.
[01:15:16.549 --> 01:15:17.570]  He is a good man.
[01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:18.871]  He is a godly man.
[01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:20.532]  He is an innocent man.
[01:15:20.552 --> 01:15:22.433]  He is a man of great promise.
[01:15:22.493 --> 01:15:31.160]  Do not let the left-wing hate machine that sought to destroy me, sought to destroy General Flynn, now destroy this great American patriot.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:31.881]  Amen.
[01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.924]  And by the way, that's another topic for you to come back.
[01:15:33.984 --> 01:15:35.286]  We're trying to get Flynn to run.
[01:15:35.306 --> 01:15:36.367]  We're begging him on our knees.
[01:15:36.768 --> 01:15:37.429]  We love him.
[01:15:37.469 --> 01:15:38.090]  We're not against Trump.
[01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.711]  We're not against Gates.
[01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:41.975]  Whoever will do it will take up the sword politically of truth.
[01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:44.319]  Whoever will pull Excalibur, that's a whole other subject.
[01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.300]  In fact, don't wait.
[01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:46.522]  Come on later this week.
[01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:47.263]  Let's draft
[01:15:48.123 --> 01:15:48.724]  Him on air.
[01:15:48.764 --> 01:15:58.232]  Let's draft... I know you're waiting on Gates, you're waiting on Trump, but let's... We need to get him in the field regardless, because they're all kind of waiting, because they're patriots, and they don't want to push to the head of the trough.
[01:15:58.272 --> 01:16:02.036]  Let's draft General Flynn to get going.
[01:16:02.056 --> 01:16:02.917]  What do you think, Roger?
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.105]  Look, I think I've made it as clear as I can that if the President runs, I'm for the President.
[01:16:08.165 --> 01:16:12.790]  And he has the right to make that decision, and he has the luxury to make it in his own time.
[01:16:13.311 --> 01:16:22.161]  But if the President doesn't run, it's absolutely vital that we have a candidate, a man or a woman, who really understands and supports and completely is committed to
[01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:24.763]  Hold on, you have five more minutes, exactly, on Flynn.
[01:16:24.803 --> 01:16:26.544]  We need a stand-in.
[01:16:26.984 --> 01:16:28.665]  You're being delicate here, we're not against Trump.
[01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:32.868]  If Trump isn't going to do it, we have to fire up Flynn, and we were firing up Gates behind the scenes.
[01:16:33.108 --> 01:16:35.290]  We have to have them ready in case Trump doesn't do it.
[01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:36.050]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:36.751 --> 01:16:48.579]  Alright, I'm not going to give anybody inside information or anything, but let's just say Roger and I have been working very hard to not get Flynn to block a Matt Gaetz or a Trump.
[01:16:48.659 --> 01:16:49.640]  We want them all to run.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:50.941]  Trump's up top.
[01:16:51.938 --> 01:16:52.419]  I don't know.
[01:17:10.017 --> 01:17:21.705]  It's not like we're here cheating on each other or something to say we want to get General Flynn ready to run as president now, to get the momentum of him running, to then offer that support to Trump later, which I think he would do.
[01:17:21.765 --> 01:17:22.926]  Maybe he's a VP, who knows?
[01:17:23.507 --> 01:17:25.668]  So, Roger's been very delicate about this.
[01:17:25.688 --> 01:17:26.709]  He's given Flynn reports.
[01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:27.649]  I'm not going to get into all of it.
[01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:31.052]  There's been a lot going on behind the scenes, but we need to draft Flynn.
[01:17:31.452 --> 01:17:34.995]  We can't wait, regardless of the leadership of people running for president now.
[01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:39.316]  To get the people mobilized to execute a plan to challenge the globalists.
[01:17:39.356 --> 01:17:43.536]  Because who else but Cruz and then Gates or a few others are fighting.
[01:17:43.816 --> 01:17:44.797]  They're all under attack.
[01:17:45.257 --> 01:17:46.237]  We need to do this.
[01:17:46.297 --> 01:17:48.637]  It's something we have to do even though it makes us targets, Roger.
[01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:50.157]  That's why they want you out of the game.
[01:17:50.518 --> 01:17:51.758]  They're obviously tapping your phones.
[01:17:51.778 --> 01:17:52.138]  They know.
[01:17:52.518 --> 01:17:56.018]  It's not a secret how much you talk to General Flynn or how much we meet with him or any of that.
[01:17:56.459 --> 01:17:58.399]  So this is not a secret because the enemy knows.
[01:17:58.819 --> 01:17:59.919]  Why not let the audience know?
[01:17:59.959 --> 01:18:00.679]  Don't give it all away.
[01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:03.760]  But we're really trying to draft Flynn to go ahead and announce for president.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.660]  So tell us about it.
[01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:10.138]  Well, first of all, Alex, I have the highest possible regard for General Flynn.
[01:18:10.618 --> 01:18:13.459]  I mean, this guy is a genuine American war hero.
[01:18:13.519 --> 01:18:14.539]  He's not just a veteran.
[01:18:14.979 --> 01:18:15.700]  He's a hero.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.681]  He put his own life on the line to save his fellow servicemen.
[01:18:20.101 --> 01:18:23.323]  He's a man of enormous integrity and he's a man of enormous knowledge.
[01:18:23.723 --> 01:18:30.786]  He really understands the threats that face the country perhaps better than a handful of people in the country.
[01:18:31.266 --> 01:18:34.507]  Now, I believe, however, that his greatest single appeal
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.984]  Is the fact that he's not a politician and therefore I don't think he should run for president.
[01:18:41.724 --> 01:18:52.911]  I think if President Trump does not run, it is very clear to me that there's going to be a national draft to try to persuade General Flynn to stand up and do his duty to his country.
[01:18:53.735 --> 01:19:01.400]  Based on my conversations with him, I don't think he hankers for power or is desperate to be elected president for his own ego.
[01:19:02.101 --> 01:19:06.664]  But I think you might persuade him to do it because it is his duty to the country.
[01:19:07.004 --> 01:19:09.346]  The man and his family have been through hell.
[01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:11.767]  Sure, but he needs to start making the prep.
[01:19:11.787 --> 01:19:12.648]  Well, he wants to win.
[01:19:12.688 --> 01:19:13.628]  He wants to defeat the enemy.
[01:19:13.989 --> 01:19:15.470]  This is not about who's president, who's not.
[01:19:15.490 --> 01:19:16.811]  He's a George Washington type guy.
[01:19:17.111 --> 01:19:17.871]  He has to do it.
[01:19:17.911 --> 01:19:18.552]  Who else is there?
[01:19:18.872 --> 01:19:20.093]  There's Trump, Gates, and him.
[01:19:23.456 --> 01:19:29.902]  I agree on paper that he has the stature and the gravitas and the experience to be a viable candidate.
[01:19:30.242 --> 01:19:43.375]  But I think the American people are going to rise up and draft him whether he wants to run or not in the event that President Trump, the real favorite... I agree and he's got to start, as we said, the foundation now just in case Trump doesn't do it, correct?
[01:19:44.298 --> 01:19:45.999]  Yes and what's part of that?
[01:19:46.219 --> 01:19:47.960]  One thing he needs to do and he's doing it.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.601]  He needs to move around the country making speeches.
[01:19:50.961 --> 01:19:56.764]  He needs to impact individual media markets but on your way you're collecting IOUs.
[01:19:56.964 --> 01:20:00.146]  On your way you're making vital future contacts
[01:20:00.566 --> 01:20:02.287]  That could come in very handy.
[01:20:21.312 --> 01:20:29.395]  Our greatest presidents have been the individuals who did not burn for the office and did not have to become president in order to be someone.
[01:20:29.875 --> 01:20:33.176]  Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:20:33.977 --> 01:20:35.437]  I believe he's in that category.
[01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:36.758]  He's already- George Washington!
[01:20:37.475 --> 01:20:38.255]  George Washington.
[01:20:38.915 --> 01:20:48.918]  But I believe that General Flynn's greatest public service lies ahead, and I'm hopeful that when his countrymen call on him, and I believe they will, if the President does not run.
[01:20:48.938 --> 01:20:49.398]  I agree.
[01:20:49.438 --> 01:20:53.639]  So we're for Trump, and if he doesn't do it for Gates, but the launchpad must be built.
[01:20:53.859 --> 01:20:57.499]  You can't just bring him out of mothballs and moonshot Flynn.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.680]  We have to build him the launchpad.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:13.290]  But let's also be clear, if Matt Gaetz, through sheer will and the heart of a brawler and a fighter, survives this audacious attempt to smear him, he will be even stronger as a candidate.
[01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:16.934]  Remember three weeks ago I was at your office and I said, you know they're going to come after Gaetz.
[01:21:16.954 --> 01:21:17.934]  And you said, oh, no doubt.
[01:21:18.395 --> 01:21:19.376]  We're seeing it right now.
[01:21:20.536 --> 01:21:22.858]  It's because it's payback time.
[01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.840]  This is all about political payback.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:25.561]  That's all it is.
[01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:27.971]  Well, I know Flynn's not stupid.
[01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:28.711]  He said, well, I don't care.
[01:21:28.731 --> 01:21:29.531]  I don't care what happens to me.
[01:21:29.571 --> 01:21:29.972]  I get it.
[01:21:30.532 --> 01:21:32.313]  But his name is important.
[01:21:33.413 --> 01:21:34.453]  Now he belongs to the people.
[01:21:34.754 --> 01:21:36.214]  They're coming after him regardless.
[01:21:36.274 --> 01:21:37.575]  He's got to go on offense now.
[01:21:38.723 --> 01:21:43.746]  It's unbelievable to me that the Army is reinvestigating his contacts with the Russians.
[01:21:43.786 --> 01:21:48.389]  This is so nonsensical that it's absurd, that it's insulting.
[01:21:48.729 --> 01:22:01.457]  Do we really think that Robert Mueller, with his unlimited budget and favorable judges and a favorable venue and all the power that no previous special counsel ever had, would have found something?
[01:22:01.477 --> 01:22:06.400]  He found nothing, other than the fact that General Flynn is a patriotic, loyal American.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.541]  That's what he found.
[01:22:08.663 --> 01:22:13.085]  Well, Roger, they want to get you and get me because we're loyal Americans and we've taken action.
[01:22:13.105 --> 01:22:16.147]  We've proven we have the zeitgeist and we've proven we're ready to defeat them.
[01:22:16.187 --> 01:22:17.748]  Everybody else is scared.
[01:22:17.828 --> 01:22:22.751]  I wish that I was made obsolete by other men stepping up and other women stepping up, but that's not happening.
[01:22:23.351 --> 01:22:26.053]  And so it's up to us again once more into the battle.
[01:22:26.933 --> 01:22:28.995]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:34.738]  You're joining us again tomorrow, if you can, to get more into Flynn, more into politics, and nobody's got a plan.
[01:22:35.138 --> 01:22:35.839]  We've got a plan.
[01:22:35.859 --> 01:22:36.799]  We've got to launch the plan.
[01:22:37.099 --> 01:22:39.961]  So join me tomorrow, if you're ready, or the next day, with the plan.
[01:22:40.001 --> 01:22:41.182]  Roger Stone, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:22:42.222 --> 01:22:43.283]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[01:22:43.363 --> 01:22:46.705]  It's great to be back on InfoWars, and I look forward to my next gig.
[01:22:47.085 --> 01:22:47.466]  Yes, sir.
[01:22:47.526 --> 01:22:47.786]  Thank you.
[01:22:47.806 --> 01:22:48.326]  Whenever you want.
[01:22:48.386 --> 01:22:49.507]  He says tomorrow or the next day.
[01:22:49.847 --> 01:22:50.768]  Roger's got a big plan.
[01:22:50.808 --> 01:22:51.568]  I believe I've seen it.
[01:22:52.349 --> 01:22:53.729]  It's a long plan.
[01:22:53.749 --> 01:22:54.130]  He's written it.
[01:22:55.245 --> 01:23:01.248]  A long 70-page plan, and then some, and that's why they are so pissed, but we've got a blueprint for victory, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:06.530]  I mean, and again, these leftists want to be a president or a senator.
[01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:07.711]  I don't want to be there.
[01:23:08.111 --> 01:23:09.171]  I love Texas.
[01:23:09.211 --> 01:23:22.097]  I want to be on a lake with my family in some shotgun shack playing checkers and drinking moonshine, but I've got to be here, ladies and gentlemen, because I'm not going to be a slave to these people, and I'm going to kick their ass with your help.
[01:23:22.917 --> 01:23:23.218]  All right.
[01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:25.213]  If he's here.
[01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:25.533]  I don't know.
[01:23:25.553 --> 01:23:26.493]  I haven't seen him arrive yet.
[01:23:26.553 --> 01:23:27.274]  Stuart Rhodes.
[01:23:28.454 --> 01:23:30.034]  I already lost the article again.
[01:23:30.074 --> 01:23:33.175]  Will you guys please print me the... Will you guys... It was on the phone.
[01:23:33.195 --> 01:23:35.696]  I thought it was going to be in studio.
[01:23:35.736 --> 01:23:36.056]  No, I know.
[01:23:36.076 --> 01:23:36.716]  Owen's on the phone.
[01:23:36.876 --> 01:23:37.976]  Is Stuart Rhodes here?
[01:23:39.977 --> 01:23:40.477]  Okay, not yet.
[01:23:40.517 --> 01:23:40.897]  Okay, great.
[01:23:40.917 --> 01:23:41.537]  We'll go to Owen.
[01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:42.238]  That's good.
[01:23:42.298 --> 01:23:42.758]  So he's behind.
[01:23:42.798 --> 01:23:44.898]  We'll get Stuart Rhodes on at 15 after.
[01:23:45.398 --> 01:23:46.039]  In studio.
[01:23:46.839 --> 01:23:48.339]  And I already had you guys give it to me twice.
[01:23:48.919 --> 01:23:49.920]  You've done a great job.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.300]  It's gotten mixed up in my stack.
[01:23:52.298 --> 01:23:52.858]  No, here it is.
[01:23:53.338 --> 01:23:57.781]  Many capital writers unlikely to serve jail time politico because they didn't do anything wrong.
[01:23:58.681 --> 01:24:02.123]  So, their whole system is evaporating in front of their eyes.
[01:24:02.243 --> 01:24:05.204]  That is coming up.
[01:24:05.224 --> 01:24:15.349]  We're going to talk two segments to Owen Schroyer, then we're going to be talking to a good friend of mine, constitutional lawyer, veteran, patriot, in studio.
[01:24:15.369 --> 01:24:19.611]  We're going to be talking to Stuart Rhodes about this attempt to start an insurrection
[01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:23.182]  against the American people.
[01:24:23.202 --> 01:24:26.584]  But the first thing I want to do is tell you about one of our great sponsors.
[01:24:27.404 --> 01:24:32.407]  When the cell towers go down, along with power failure, satellite phones will still work.
[01:24:33.867 --> 01:24:38.410]  Cell phones are always tracking and logging everywhere you go and everything you say.
[01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.071]  Satellite phones do not have this issue.
[01:24:40.471 --> 01:24:42.812]  Satellite phones work in every extreme location.
[01:24:43.192 --> 01:24:44.733]  If you can see the sky, your phone will work.
[01:24:45.233 --> 01:24:48.955]  The Alex Jones Special is a free satellite phone for only $9.95 a month for 150 minutes per month.
[01:24:51.604 --> 01:24:55.988]  No charge for receiving calls from other cell phones or landlines to your sat phone.
[01:24:56.528 --> 01:25:03.034]  Car antennas and home antennas are available, so satellite phones can be used outdoors or while traveling in your vehicle.
[01:25:03.074 --> 01:25:06.818]  Stay in touch with loved ones during a national or international emergency.
[01:25:07.278 --> 01:25:08.759]  Infowarsphone.com.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.543]  Infowarsphone.com or call 941-955-1020 and ask for the Alex Jones Special 941-955-1020.
[01:25:18.408 --> 01:25:21.269]  And then separately, today is the last day.
[01:25:21.929 --> 01:25:23.549]  Basil Beets sold out.
[01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:24.690]  Alpha Power and Prostagard.
[01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:27.690]  We have Living Defense to flush out the parasites.
[01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:30.031]  Next Level Probiotic, 50% off free shipping.

[01:25:44.524 --> 01:25:49.686]  It all ends tomorrow morning at infowarestore.com.
[01:25:50.327 --> 01:25:56.469]  And then, if I could get enough of this, because people realize how important it is to your immune system, your body, we could fund the whole operation.
[01:25:56.789 --> 01:26:01.731]  But because we use organic, high-quality, high-end vitamins and minerals, amino acids, we can never even get big shipments.
[01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:02.771]  We're sold out most of the time.
[01:26:03.151 --> 01:26:05.452]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is back in stock.
[01:26:05.592 --> 01:26:09.714]  Liquid multivitamin mineral with amino acids for children, for adults, for old people.
[01:26:10.294 --> 01:26:12.217]  A scoop of this makes a whole big jug.
[01:26:12.618 --> 01:26:15.883]  Drink it with your friends and family and turbocharge your body.
[01:26:15.903 --> 01:26:16.765]  1,897 reviews, 4.8 stars, 96%.
[01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:17.406]  It is incredible.
[01:26:17.526 --> 01:26:17.867]  It's 40% off.
[01:26:25.797 --> 01:26:28.238]  One day only free shipping on it, because I got to fund myself.
[01:26:28.258 --> 01:26:29.218]  This is our main funder now.
[01:26:29.258 --> 01:26:31.799]  So we're going to, the 40% off is not going to go long, folks.
[01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:33.259]  So please get it today.
[01:26:33.339 --> 01:26:41.202]  Infowarstore.com or AAA253-3139 and get a F Biden t-shirt while you're at it and wear it to church.
[01:26:41.622 --> 01:26:42.002]  All right.
[01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:54.926]  We're going to be right back with our number three with Owen, the leftist SJW destroyer Schroyer, and then in studio, the one, the only Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers.
[01:26:55.948 --> 01:26:57.770]  I got me a rock and roll band!
[01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:58.690]  It's a free-for-all!
[01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:01.893]  I got me a TV radio network with millions of viewers!
[01:27:01.973 --> 01:27:02.894]  It's a free-for-all!
[01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:04.095]  Woo!
[01:27:04.896 --> 01:27:07.078]  And we knew the censorship was coming, so we're ready!
[01:27:07.098 --> 01:27:10.581]  Joining us in the next two segments is Owen Schroyer from the border.
[01:27:10.941 --> 01:27:18.568]  He's on the phone because they're staking out a facility showing the whole chain of events of criminal smuggling of children in contravention of federal and state law.
[01:27:18.988 --> 01:27:21.350]  Owen Schroyer on the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:22.471]  What's left of us.
[01:27:22.511 --> 01:27:23.292]  Tell us what you're witnessing.
[01:27:24.915 --> 01:27:40.204]  Well, Alex, we've been trying to get a clearer picture of the details of this pipeline of illegal immigration, and we're now discovering that there's multiple fronts of criminal racketeering happening here, and it's a massive payout for a lot of people involved.
[01:27:40.224 --> 01:27:42.125]  But let me tell you what we've learned today, Alex.
[01:27:42.725 --> 01:27:45.027]  And I got an undercover interview with a gentleman.
[01:27:45.247 --> 01:27:47.028]  It's going up to Band.Video.
[01:27:47.068 --> 01:27:52.211]  This gentleman drives the illegal immigrants from the facilities to the hotels.
[01:27:52.791 --> 01:28:01.256]  And so, a few days ago, we heard that the Biden administration gave ICE almost $90 million to book hotel rooms for illegal immigrants.
[01:28:01.296 --> 01:28:05.038]  But it was kind of clear, or kind of unclear, what exactly that meant.
[01:28:05.078 --> 01:28:07.120]  Or that, is that for the overflow of facilities?
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:07.800]  Who's going there?
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:11.242]  Well, we learned today, Alex, and we have all of this documented.
[01:28:11.662 --> 01:28:17.846]  Like I said, we're just putting the links together of this pipeline of illegal immigration being facilitated and promoted by the Biden administration.
[01:28:18.644 --> 01:28:24.207]  So they come in, Alex, and they go to a testing facility for COVID in downtown McAllen.
[01:28:24.707 --> 01:28:28.329]  And this is repeated in many parts of the United States, but this is what we documented.
[01:28:28.769 --> 01:28:30.090]  So they go in there, they get tested.
[01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:35.593]  If they test positive, they get put on a different van from those that test negative.
[01:28:35.613 --> 01:28:42.796]  And if they test negative, they go to the Catholic Charity Center, where they're sheltered, fed, clothed, until they can get on a plane or a bus out of town.
[01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:46.278]  If they test positive, they get on a separate van
[01:28:46.838 --> 01:28:51.341]  And the hotel rooms that are being booked are actually being used as quarantine zones.
[01:28:51.942 --> 01:28:58.106]  Now, they are mixed in with general population, and they're held up in these hotel rooms for seven days.
[01:28:58.626 --> 01:29:06.312]  Now, they're already in buses, mass busloads of these people testing positive for COVID, and they don't quarantine anybody else.
[01:29:06.792 --> 01:29:09.014]  This shows the whole COVID thing's a giant fraud.
[01:29:10.163 --> 01:29:11.184]  A total fraud, Alex.
[01:29:11.424 --> 01:29:16.867]  And anything that they hear, you know they're going to say, oh, super spread, oh, spread, the continued spread, and they're going to say all this.
[01:29:17.087 --> 01:29:20.909]  And they won't say a damn thing that they're bringing COVID in from the southern border.
[01:29:20.949 --> 01:29:23.830]  Now, obviously, we're not the fear mongers of COVID.
[01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:25.271]  We're not the scandemics.
[01:29:25.551 --> 01:29:27.732]  But it shows it's totally a fraud.
[01:29:29.533 --> 01:29:30.354]  So think about this.
[01:29:30.996 --> 01:29:33.718]  The American taxpayer is currently facilitating.
[01:29:33.738 --> 01:29:35.500]  What happens if this person gets really sick?
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.041]  What happens if they have to go to a hospital?
[01:29:37.362 --> 01:29:38.202]  Who's paying for that?
[01:29:38.242 --> 01:29:39.183]  Who's driving them there?
[01:29:39.383 --> 01:29:40.524]  They don't even speak English.
[01:29:40.764 --> 01:29:42.206]  They don't even have IDs.
[01:29:42.706 --> 01:29:43.947]  And they're being bussed in.
[01:29:44.227 --> 01:29:45.589]  They're being drove to hotels.
[01:29:45.809 --> 01:29:47.250]  They're being drove to airports.
[01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:48.751]  They're being drove to buses.
[01:29:48.992 --> 01:29:51.414]  And it's all being funded by the taxpayers.
[01:29:51.674 --> 01:29:53.996]  And it's all the Biden administration agenda.
[01:29:54.316 --> 01:29:56.278]  I mean, this is so cut and dry, Alex.
[01:29:56.778 --> 01:29:58.319]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:29:58.339 --> 01:29:59.820]  I mean, you want to talk about impeachment?
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.261]  Forget about impeachment.
[01:30:01.281 --> 01:30:06.765]  I mean, we need to be moving on to criminal trials for what they've been doing to this country and collapsing the southern border.
[01:30:06.805 --> 01:30:08.706]  So, we're paying for all of it.
[01:30:09.847 --> 01:30:11.288]  We're capturing all of it on footage.
[01:30:11.328 --> 01:30:13.009]  It's all going up at Banned Out Video.
[01:30:13.289 --> 01:30:15.851]  I put the interview up at Banned Out Video, and we're getting the latest
[01:30:16.471 --> 01:30:17.733]  Breaking reports up there too.
[01:30:17.933 --> 01:30:19.856]  And that's in the border crisis section.
[01:30:20.276 --> 01:30:24.783]  Incredible drone footage, incredible river footage, incredible airport footage.
[01:30:25.143 --> 01:30:33.375]  This is all world-level stuff and I've told other other websites I said I don't care about the credit just take our video don't give us credit just get it out because this is illegal.
[01:30:35.171 --> 01:30:40.612]  Yeah, and so we're just documenting where they're getting picked up, where they're getting dropped off.
[01:30:40.812 --> 01:30:45.854]  I mean, from the border all the way into Texas, into the hotels, into the planes.
[01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:46.754]  We've documented all of it.
[01:30:46.794 --> 01:30:48.694]  And like the Q folks said, there are underground bases.
[01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:49.695]  No, there's not underground bases.
[01:30:49.715 --> 01:30:53.135]  There's giant border patrol facilities full of hundreds of thousands of kids.
[01:30:53.155 --> 01:30:53.675]  They're right there.
[01:30:53.956 --> 01:30:54.756]  So save them, folks.
[01:30:54.796 --> 01:30:55.256]  Expose it.
[01:30:55.796 --> 01:30:56.636]  Q orders it.
[01:30:58.957 --> 01:31:00.837]  I can only get Flynn to lead the Q movement.
[01:31:00.857 --> 01:31:01.657]  I almost got him ready.
[01:31:02.098 --> 01:31:03.338]  All right, Owen, stay there.
[01:31:04.309 --> 01:31:07.691]  Because, you know, to stop the globalist movement, you've got to take control of their movement.
[01:31:07.991 --> 01:31:10.713]  We will hijack their movement if Flynn can be drafted.
[01:31:11.213 --> 01:31:12.074]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:31:13.995 --> 01:31:16.316]  Won't you fly, Freebird?
[01:31:16.756 --> 01:31:17.317]  Woo!
[01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:21.359]  It is the animating contest of liberty!
[01:31:21.779 --> 01:31:29.564]  And I thank the creator of the universe for airdropping me into this planet to have this adventure and to show what side I'm on.
[01:31:30.144 --> 01:31:32.626]  And I look forward to eternity, which I get to see.
[01:31:34.423 --> 01:31:36.164]  Every day, into the future.
[01:31:37.685 --> 01:31:40.206]  The Satanists cannot see beyond the veil, but we can.
[01:31:40.886 --> 01:31:42.607]  And it is incredible.
[01:31:44.488 --> 01:31:49.231]  While they grasp at straws at this level, we've already seen heaven.
[01:31:52.054 --> 01:31:59.258]  All right, Owen Schroer, we've got incredible thought criminal Stuart Rhodes joining us of Oath Keepers with big breaking news of this lawyer next segment.
[01:31:59.618 --> 01:32:01.940]  We'll host a little bit the next hour and the guest hosts will take over.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.641]  But I wanted you to be able to finish up because we're a little bit behind today.
[01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:05.422]  Sorry I got you on late.
[01:32:06.991 --> 01:32:12.973]  With what you're witnessing at the border, I mean, everywhere you go, it's 50 times the flood we ever saw.
[01:32:13.513 --> 01:32:21.516]  You have footage of like hundreds of buses, hundreds of 18-wheelers, giant facilities, drones go up, buildings being built everywhere.
[01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.616]  This is a total invasion.
[01:32:23.896 --> 01:32:30.258]  And here's the head of the Border Patrol, former head, ex-ICE director, Homan, administration designed surge to open borders.
[01:32:30.359 --> 01:32:30.779]  Totally!
[01:32:31.159 --> 01:32:34.480]  Then we have the Republicans putting out videos proving it's a crisis.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:42.502]  That's like proving trees have green leaves on them, or Adolf Hitler was a Nazi, or Santa Claus wears a red and white, you know, outfit.
[01:32:42.602 --> 01:32:52.825]  I mean, the Republicans are still debating whether it's a crisis, because the Washington Post says there wasn't one, instead of pointing out the biggest human smuggling operation the world has ever seen.
[01:32:52.905 --> 01:32:53.445]  Owen Schroer.
[01:32:55.866 --> 01:32:57.526]  Yeah, Alex, so just a quick update.
[01:32:57.546 --> 01:32:59.427]  I want to restate what I said.
[01:32:59.467 --> 01:33:02.928]  So we're, we are at a border entry point right now.
[01:33:03.751 --> 01:33:07.562]  And we are now tailing a busload of illegal immigrants.
[01:33:07.602 --> 01:33:09.828]  Like I said, we're just documenting... You're showing the whole chain.
[01:33:09.869 --> 01:33:10.771]  You're showing the whole deal.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:23.124]  And so, but get this, so we're down here with Greg Reese as well, and we went up because we were trying to document them coming in, like the actual point of entry, and then to see the process of them going to the facility.
[01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.645]  It looks like we're about to document that now.
[01:33:25.105 --> 01:33:41.071]  And Greg Reese went up to the border wall section, which is now not being completed, thanks to the Biden administration, and there's obviously a lot of illegal immigration happening here because they have a busload, but Greg walks up to the wall and Border Patrol stops him and tells him he can't go any further.
[01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:52.421]  So we're currently facilitating a wide open border illegal immigration operation and American citizens can't even walk around the border and ask what's going on and film.
[01:33:52.942 --> 01:33:54.904]  Oh yeah, it was about five years ago.
[01:33:55.424 --> 01:33:59.989]  I'm with my children at beautiful Big Bend National Park on the Rio Grande.
[01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:03.972]  They got these natural springs, an old collapsed spa that was privately built.
[01:34:04.313 --> 01:34:06.054]  The ruins are there, like Greek ruins.
[01:34:07.162 --> 01:34:12.248]  But modern ruins and you're there in the hot spring and the, the, the, the, not the border patrol.
[01:34:12.268 --> 01:34:12.869]  They're there too.
[01:34:12.929 --> 01:34:21.399]  But it was the, uh, it was the park rangers come up and go, Oh, you can't throw the football to each other back and forth across the Rio Grande.
[01:34:21.419 --> 01:34:22.100]  That's illegal.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.002]  The Rio Grande is only like 15 feet there.
[01:34:25.163 --> 01:34:31.610]  And we're like, there's coyotes and dudes on horseback bringing marijuana back and trying to sell us little weird glass statues.
[01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:33.131]  I did buy some of the glass statues.
[01:34:33.672 --> 01:34:36.054]  And like, dude, the Mexicans are laughing at them.
[01:34:36.074 --> 01:34:40.319]  They're on horseback going back and forth, and they're telling us not to throw a football back and forth.
[01:34:40.579 --> 01:34:42.061]  So basically, that's what you're saying you saw.
[01:34:43.607 --> 01:34:44.448]  It's rules.
[01:34:44.688 --> 01:34:46.229]  It's the double standard, but it's beyond.
[01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:48.911]  The illegal immigrants have more rights than we do.
[01:34:49.391 --> 01:34:54.194]  The American citizen has less freedoms than illegal immigrants coming into this country right now.
[01:34:54.335 --> 01:34:55.535]  It's really incredible.
[01:34:55.575 --> 01:34:58.958]  But I want to restate what I said last segment that we found out.
[01:34:59.498 --> 01:35:07.145]  The hotel rooms, Alex, they called all the hotel rooms in McAllen and booked up every room for the foreseeable future.
[01:35:07.486 --> 01:35:09.908]  So if you're coming to McAllen trying to get a hotel room, forget about it.
[01:35:09.948 --> 01:35:12.530]  We got lucky that we were able to get two.
[01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:14.832]  So, for the crew.
[01:35:15.753 --> 01:35:20.137]  So you can't even get a hotel room and they're putting... By the way, keep those booked even though you're coming back.
[01:35:20.317 --> 01:35:21.879]  Keep those booked because I'm coming down soon.
[01:35:22.239 --> 01:35:22.840]  Keep those booked.
[01:35:24.119 --> 01:35:30.003]  So they're putting the COVID positive people in hotel rooms with whoever else is in there.
[01:35:30.343 --> 01:35:31.984]  They're quarantining them for seven days.
[01:35:32.304 --> 01:35:37.308]  They're not quarantining the rest of the bus that the COVID positive patients arrived in.
[01:35:37.668 --> 01:35:40.069]  And they're not quarantining any of the other individuals.
[01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:49.435]  They're basically moved to facilities and then moved throughout the country within seven days to a final destination via bus or via airplane, which we've documented.
[01:35:49.455 --> 01:35:51.597]  And no executive order, no law.
[01:35:52.077 --> 01:35:53.038]  Totally lawless.
[01:35:53.419 --> 01:35:57.765]  Meanwhile, the Republicans shot a six-minute video going, there is a crisis!
[01:35:58.125 --> 01:36:03.773]  They're not even getting to who the crisis is, what the crisis is, and now it's premeditated by O'Biden.
[01:36:05.245 --> 01:36:13.128]  And you can tell that the people involved don't want the media knowing what's going on, because they're aware of our presence.
[01:36:13.168 --> 01:36:15.969]  Oh yeah, we're all banned on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, folks.
[01:36:16.009 --> 01:36:19.570]  General public can put an account up, call it South Texas News.
[01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:21.971]  Everybody should be down there filming this.
[01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:26.452]  Everybody should go to the Texas border now, because this is the collapse of America.
[01:36:26.752 --> 01:36:27.993]  This is information war.
[01:36:28.053 --> 01:36:29.333]  You've got to show what's happening.
[01:36:29.613 --> 01:36:30.954]  Just show it, folks.
[01:36:32.552 --> 01:36:37.158]  And it's, Alex, I mean, you go to this facility in McAllen, it's not going to take long.
[01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:39.742]  You're going to see them arriving every half hour.
[01:36:39.762 --> 01:36:44.248]  I mean, today it was like every 10 minutes dropping off van loads of these illegal immigrants.
[01:36:44.328 --> 01:36:47.152]  It's happening around the clock, all day long.
[01:36:47.532 --> 01:36:56.258]  They're being moved to hotels, they're being moved to facilities, some are being taken to the airport, some are being dropped at the bus station, it's happening 24-7 around the clock.
[01:36:56.298 --> 01:37:04.084]  This is a well-funded, this is a well-oiled machine, this is industrial-level illegal immigration happening.
[01:37:04.144 --> 01:37:06.606]  This is, I mean, I don't even know what to call this, quite frankly.
[01:37:06.626 --> 01:37:11.910]  This is officially the end of the country, the collapsing of law, the UN takeover, replacement migration.
[01:37:12.955 --> 01:37:15.500]  Yeah, government supported human smuggling.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.485]  I mean, I just I don't even know what to call this.
[01:37:18.565 --> 01:37:19.647]  It's so unbelievable.
[01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:20.669]  It's the end of the country.
[01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:21.410]  This is the U.N.
[01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:21.851]  invasion.
[01:37:22.372 --> 01:37:26.179]  Well, you saw Biden say six months ago, when I'm elected, surge the border.
[01:37:27.774 --> 01:37:28.995]  It's the Biden invasion.
[01:37:29.055 --> 01:37:30.436]  It's the Democrat invasion.
[01:37:30.736 --> 01:37:32.257]  And then there's the racket on top of it.
[01:37:32.477 --> 01:37:45.024]  The guy admitted in this in this recording that I have that the reason a lot of these cities are in support of the migrant tent centers coming in is because they got devastated economically by COVID.
[01:37:45.344 --> 01:37:46.805]  But now they're making a bunch of money.
[01:37:46.825 --> 01:37:47.506]  The hotel.
[01:37:48.166 --> 01:37:50.928]  They shut down the third world and starved them, caused the flood.
[01:37:51.228 --> 01:37:52.088]  They shut us down.
[01:37:52.148 --> 01:37:55.750]  Now we want federal money to take care of the flood, but there'll be no jobs for them.
[01:37:56.051 --> 01:37:58.072]  Once they get here, there'll be a politically controlled group.
[01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:01.534]  All right, we've created the news section at band.video.
[01:38:01.574 --> 01:38:09.238]  You go to band.video, or they censor that on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, so you go to bandthis.tv.
[01:38:09.318 --> 01:38:10.299]  We put that URL up.
[01:38:10.879 --> 01:38:14.021]  And it's the same thing as ban.video, banthis.tv.
[01:38:14.321 --> 01:38:21.144]  You click the left-hand corner, little three lines, pull up the channels, top channel is Southern Border Crisis.
[01:38:21.645 --> 01:38:33.911]  Above Alex Jones, above War Room, above Washington Journal, above Greg Reese, above Paul Joseph Watson is Biden Child Trafficking Center, Southern Border in Crisis page.
[01:38:34.431 --> 01:38:38.834]  This information is coffin nails to their takeover, but with total tech censorship,
[01:38:39.693 --> 01:38:41.616]  The only way it gets out is if you share it.
[01:38:41.636 --> 01:38:44.722]  And if you share ban.video, Twitter and Facebook ban it.
[01:38:45.182 --> 01:38:46.925]  But they've not banned this URL yet.
[01:38:46.966 --> 01:38:47.687]  They probably will soon.
[01:38:47.707 --> 01:38:48.248]  We'll have a new one.
[01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:52.916]  For right now, the URL that's not banned, as far as people are watching, they'll ban it soon.
[01:38:53.917 --> 01:38:54.978]  ...is ban this.
[01:38:55.118 --> 01:38:56.579]  B-A-N this.
[01:38:56.739 --> 01:38:59.080]  Ban this dot TV.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.921]  Ban this dot TV.
[01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:02.142]  Drone footage.
[01:39:02.742 --> 01:39:03.843]  Footage of the smugglers.
[01:39:04.263 --> 01:39:06.024]  Footage of the giant facilities being built.
[01:39:06.505 --> 01:39:11.648]  Footage of the people in the airports, no ID, let through GSA, with kidnapped children flying everywhere.
[01:39:12.048 --> 01:39:14.128]  BANTHIS.TV.
[01:39:14.248 --> 01:39:17.869]  B-A-N-T-H-I-S.TV.
[01:39:17.969 --> 01:39:19.489]  BANTHIS.TV.
[01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:21.030]  This is a war, people!
[01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:24.430]  And they've engineered you and conditioned you and me as well to just get used to this.
[01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:25.891]  We can't be used to this.
[01:39:26.211 --> 01:39:29.771]  This is the collapse of the country, the globalist takeover.
[01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:32.652]  If they get away with this, it'll be ten times worse in six months.
[01:39:32.952 --> 01:39:38.033]  That's why they are promoting ten... I asked a high-level city official and state official at a meeting six months ago.
[01:39:39.349 --> 01:39:43.252]  I said, are they putting all the tent cities up and letting them happen to get us ready for collapse?
[01:39:43.272 --> 01:39:46.134]  They said, yeah, because there's going to be tent cities of illegals everywhere.
[01:39:46.475 --> 01:39:47.776]  And they're going to be like, where's the food?
[01:39:47.796 --> 01:39:48.376]  Where's the money?
[01:39:48.616 --> 01:39:49.557]  They'll be the new weapon.
[01:39:49.757 --> 01:39:52.699]  So I'm not against these poor people being exploited, but this is the plan.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.681]  This is the UN invasion.
[01:39:55.061 --> 01:39:59.084]  This is the Red Dawn takeover, not with soldiers, but with hundreds of millions.
[01:39:59.365 --> 01:40:00.205]  It's millions now.
[01:40:00.505 --> 01:40:01.766]  It'll soon be hundreds of millions.
[01:40:01.867 --> 01:40:03.728]  So ban this.tv.
[01:40:04.208 --> 01:40:04.429]  Owen!
[01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:07.011]  Stay as long as you can down there at the border.
[01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:07.572]  Great job.
[01:40:07.592 --> 01:40:09.974]  War room coming up in about an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:40:10.014 --> 01:40:10.975]  Thank you, Owen, so much.
[01:40:12.417 --> 01:40:13.058]  All right, Alex.
[01:40:13.098 --> 01:40:13.899]  More reports coming.
[01:40:13.939 --> 01:40:16.401]  It's unbelievable watching this and witnessing this history.
[01:40:17.142 --> 01:40:18.444]  This is the takedown of America.
[01:40:18.464 --> 01:40:20.426]  But if we wake up and spread the word now, they fail.
[01:40:20.466 --> 01:40:22.388]  But now is the time.
[01:40:22.908 --> 01:40:24.430]  Ban this.tv.
[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:26.833]  Go to the Southern Border Crisis section.
[01:40:28.283 --> 01:40:30.224]  And share those links.
[01:40:30.344 --> 01:40:31.044]  We're fighting.
[01:40:31.464 --> 01:40:33.745]  We need your help to spread the word and amplify it.
[01:40:34.105 --> 01:40:36.386]  Stuart Rhodes, Oath Keepers, in studio, coming up.
[01:40:37.846 --> 01:40:47.589]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:56.332]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.721]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:41:03.741 --> 01:41:05.321]  Scum!
[01:41:06.142 --> 01:41:08.083]  Russian scum!
[01:41:08.103 --> 01:41:13.045]  The whole world has come to mind.
[01:41:13.105 --> 01:41:19.188]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:41:19.648 --> 01:41:20.969]  I will not let you down.
[01:41:21.089 --> 01:41:23.991]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:41:29.096 --> 01:41:36.779]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[01:41:37.059 --> 01:41:42.761]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[01:41:42.861 --> 01:41:45.002]  The left have wised up to this.
[01:41:45.202 --> 01:41:50.584]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:51.685]  The social media giants.
[01:41:51.945 --> 01:41:52.345]  And they are.
[01:41:52.705 --> 01:41:58.328]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:41:58.428 --> 01:42:03.131]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:42:03.251 --> 01:42:10.875]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:42:11.015 --> 01:42:16.840]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:23.766]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[01:42:24.126 --> 01:42:33.915]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:42:34.517 --> 01:42:35.799]  People know what's true.
[01:42:36.039 --> 01:42:36.841]  They can smell it.
[01:42:37.342 --> 01:42:42.270]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:44.794]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[01:42:44.814 --> 01:42:48.399]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[01:42:50.963 --> 01:42:53.424]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:42:53.444 --> 01:42:53.845]  The U.S.
[01:42:53.885 --> 01:43:02.169]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:05.110]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:06.731]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:08.832]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:43:09.092 --> 01:43:11.193]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:43:11.453 --> 01:43:12.514]  This is all confirmed.
[01:43:12.534 --> 01:43:13.474]  This is not a drill.
[01:43:13.634 --> 01:43:17.556]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:43:17.916 --> 01:43:19.277]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:43:19.617 --> 01:43:19.897]  Apple 100%.
[01:43:19.937 --> 01:43:25.962]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:43:26.382 --> 01:43:31.146]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:43:31.466 --> 01:43:32.307]  This is happening.
[01:43:32.347 --> 01:43:38.031]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt.
[01:43:38.151 --> 01:43:40.753]  The censorship by just putting up with it now.
[01:43:40.793 --> 01:43:46.339]  This attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:43:46.719 --> 01:43:54.686]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:43:55.547 --> 01:43:59.068]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:43:59.128 --> 01:44:02.589]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:44:02.829 --> 01:44:09.930]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:12.811]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:44:13.171 --> 01:44:17.252]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control.
[01:44:22.227 --> 01:44:22.827]  We're good to go.
[01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:49.395]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:44:49.435 --> 01:44:54.319]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:44:54.699 --> 01:44:59.583]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:45:00.043 --> 01:45:07.607]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make the debate about Alex Jones.
[01:45:07.627 --> 01:45:14.871]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:45:14.951 --> 01:45:20.634]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[01:45:20.894 --> 01:45:25.597]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:45:25.617 --> 01:45:27.358]  I have given you the transmission
[01:45:32.493 --> 01:45:38.958]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny.
[01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:45.990]  Well, this is it!
[01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:51.092]  The desperate pro-America, pro-human, pro-freedom defense.
[01:45:52.432 --> 01:45:54.813]  And we're trying our best, though we're ragtag.
[01:45:55.233 --> 01:46:07.576]  Well, Kelly Sorrell is the head of lawyers for Trump in Michigan, all the great work she did, and the chief general counsel for OathKeepers.org, former constitutional lawyer and Army veteran and patriot Stuart Rhodes is here.
[01:46:07.997 --> 01:46:12.418]  He'll be with us about 15 minutes to the next hour, because I got him in late, and I apologize for that.
[01:46:13.599 --> 01:46:21.927]  And then we're going to have the great Chris Sky taking over the last 45 minutes of the show fighting the lockdowns.
[01:46:22.308 --> 01:46:25.911]  But we've got you both here about three minutes to break.
[01:46:26.372 --> 01:46:28.213]  Here is the big news.
[01:46:28.233 --> 01:46:28.294]  Why?
[01:46:28.714 --> 01:46:31.276]  We've got Politico, many capital rioters
[01:46:32.017 --> 01:46:37.398]  Unlikely to serve jail time because they stayed within the velvet ropes and the police let them in.
[01:46:37.698 --> 01:46:40.379]  The wheels are coming off of this, Stuart Rhodes.
[01:46:40.719 --> 01:46:42.479]  You were this mastermind terrorist.
[01:46:42.819 --> 01:46:45.760]  Though you told people don't go in the Capitol, the wheels are coming off.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.400]  Yeah, it's kind of fun to see this happening to them.
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:52.801]  And I'd like Kelly to take over talking about this.
[01:46:52.821 --> 01:46:54.381]  She used to be a prosecutor down on the border.
[01:46:54.801 --> 01:46:57.182]  As an ex-prosecutor, what do you think of the fiasco?
[01:46:58.544 --> 01:47:01.065]  I actually is kind of how it's been since the beginning.
[01:47:01.105 --> 01:47:03.106]  I think thought that they were overreaching.
[01:47:03.146 --> 01:47:09.188]  They seem to have an agenda that they wanted everything to fit into, but the facts just don't support that.
[01:47:09.648 --> 01:47:14.610]  I don't know if it was something they had planned because I believe that that event was
[01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:28.435]  Funded somehow with Antifa, but I think they wanted patriots to act up more than what happened, and then they have continued to try to push a narrative that the facts don't fit into.
[01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:29.555]  You were here over a month ago.
[01:47:29.575 --> 01:47:30.636]  That's what you said in the green room.
[01:47:30.676 --> 01:47:31.216]  You weren't on air.
[01:47:31.256 --> 01:47:32.276]  You said it looks staged.
[01:47:32.296 --> 01:47:36.718]  We're not sure yet, but now they admit they tried to stage the whole deal, and now they admit they don't have a case.
[01:47:37.338 --> 01:47:37.718]  Correct.
[01:47:37.979 --> 01:47:55.815]  And it just seems like, I mean, as Stuart and I have kind of watched it, it looked like they were trying to set up that the Oath Keepers were planning to do this and came in to do this and then it was like, well, no, maybe they just spontaneously planned right at the steps to enter and that was going to be the conspiracy.
[01:47:56.416 --> 01:47:57.017]  I think they're
[01:47:57.817 --> 01:48:10.343]  Uh, intentionally withheld evidence from the court regarding both Proud Boys and Oath Keepers having previously done similar missions on, you know, the same Stop the Steal rallies in even Georgia and D.C.
[01:48:10.363 --> 01:48:11.404]  And we never took anything over.
[01:48:12.184 --> 01:48:12.544]  Exactly.
[01:48:12.825 --> 01:48:14.906]  Well, that's where I'm at, is I know you guys.
[01:48:15.666 --> 01:48:17.507]  And if we were trying to take something over, you'd know it.
[01:48:17.767 --> 01:48:22.589]  We were trying to have a peaceful demonstration to have a 10-day investigation of the election.
[01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:24.010]  We weren't trying to take the Capitol over.
[01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:25.651]  We would have guns if that's what we were doing.
[01:48:26.291 --> 01:48:27.512]  It's what's so absurd.
[01:48:27.532 --> 01:48:35.839]  Our team leader on the ground that day was a Triple Canopy and Blackwater veteran contractor and military combat vet, an explosive expert.
[01:48:35.859 --> 01:48:37.900]  If he wanted to take the Capitol, he'd have taken the Capitol.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.241]  But he wasn't there to do that.
[01:48:39.281 --> 01:48:47.127]  He was there to do a security operation to guard Roger Stone and other VIPs and protect the Latinos for Trump event and the Stop the Steal event right there at the Capitol grounds.
[01:48:47.768 --> 01:48:48.408]  That's why we were there.
[01:48:48.428 --> 01:48:49.309]  Well, let's lay it all out.
[01:48:49.749 --> 01:48:50.750]  They're not going to stop.
[01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:53.192]  Just because the wheels are coming off, they're not going to stop.
[01:48:54.833 --> 01:49:00.175]  We're going to talk to both of you guys on the other side of this quick break and lay this out, because this is the demonization of America.
[01:49:00.455 --> 01:49:02.936]  You say, oh, Oath Keepers, oh, Proud Boys, oh, the Capitol.
[01:49:02.956 --> 01:49:03.496]  We're sick of that.
[01:49:03.836 --> 01:49:09.938]  They plan to be this, their launch against America, their police state, their new civil war.
[01:49:09.978 --> 01:49:13.079]  They're betting everything on this, and it's all built on sand.
[01:49:13.359 --> 01:49:14.079]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:14.139 --> 01:49:18.040]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com, OathKeepers.org.
[01:49:18.601 --> 01:49:22.142]  And of course, we'll tell you how to find Kelly's website as well when we come back.
[01:49:22.182 --> 01:49:22.542]  Stay with us.
[01:49:23.442 --> 01:49:25.903]  Kelly Sorrell is the Oath Keeper's General Counsel.
[01:49:26.323 --> 01:49:29.803]  Stuart Rhodes, great patriot, former lawyer in his own right, here.
[01:49:29.843 --> 01:49:30.744]  So you guys have the floor.
[01:49:30.784 --> 01:49:42.366]  Talk about this, because they're trying to frame the entire Trump movement, America, conservatives, Christians, nationalists, populists, gun owners, survivalists, common sense people, common law people, as terrorists.
[01:49:42.426 --> 01:49:44.526]  But I've got Politico, I've got New York Times.
[01:49:44.866 --> 01:49:48.667]  They're having to release everybody because they just walked in between velvet ropes.
[01:49:48.947 --> 01:49:52.448]  Maybe 15 people pooped on the floor, hit a cop or something.
[01:49:53.148 --> 01:49:55.090]  The reality is setting in.
[01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:56.131]  They're scared right now.
[01:49:56.412 --> 01:49:58.494]  They say this is going to embarrass Biden.
[01:49:59.465 --> 01:50:18.091]  Yeah, I would just actually say that we had, I saw a court of appeals reviewed, it wasn't Oath Keepers or Proud Boys, but it was a couple of other people that had been arrested, and they reviewed some of the documents that had been filed to get them out on bond, and basically said there wasn't enough evidence to show.
[01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:24.313]  There was no violence, there was no aggression, there was no hunting down congressmen, there were just people roaming halls.
[01:50:24.853 --> 01:50:26.374]  And so the narrative is really
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.140]  Not there.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.562]  What they need is not there for them to be holding all these people hostage.
[01:50:31.582 --> 01:50:35.464]  And these are basically... And notice, like, people shoot people they get out in a month.
[01:50:35.724 --> 01:50:37.405]  They're not even releasing any of these people.
[01:50:37.765 --> 01:50:39.086]  Well, they're letting some of them out now.
[01:50:39.106 --> 01:50:46.549]  The good news is, like, Robert Minuta, one of the oath keepers who was guarding Roger Stone, got out on bail because the judge did not believe he was violent.
[01:50:46.569 --> 01:50:48.050]  He said, in sharp contrast...
[01:50:48.730 --> 01:50:49.051]  That's right.
[01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:11.634]  And the left's demanding that people that were, they want people like Roger Stone that weren't even at the Trump rally or the Capitol to be arrested.
[01:51:12.054 --> 01:51:17.658]  Imagine what they're going to do when the terrorists that were just there don't get, don't get indicted or don't stay in prison.
[01:51:17.758 --> 01:51:19.679]  Well, it's a continuation of the President Trump.
[01:51:19.719 --> 01:51:26.403]  In fact, they're suing President Trump and Giuliani and Proud Boys and Oath Keepers in an attempt to, you know, create this narrative, false narrative.
[01:51:26.423 --> 01:51:28.304]  I should have added that, like the Democrats are suing him.
[01:51:28.444 --> 01:51:35.027]  Yeah, we're being sued by Benny Thompson, who's a congressman from Mississippi, and he's being represented by the NAACP.
[01:51:35.268 --> 01:51:39.230]  This false narrative, again, that we were trying to suppress black votes.
[01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:43.012]  It's always about- Had nothing to do with black people, other than they're Americans.
[01:51:43.652 --> 01:51:49.158]  Well, actually, what's ironic is they're totally projecting because they disenfranchised black Americans.
[01:51:49.478 --> 01:51:52.902]  President Trump had 52% of black male votes voting for him.
[01:51:53.242 --> 01:51:55.504]  That's who was disenfranchised when they stole the election.
[01:51:55.905 --> 01:51:59.288]  And so they want to force us on our heels and force us to be defensive.
[01:51:59.969 --> 01:52:01.911]  Exactly what they're afraid of, they project.
[01:52:02.031 --> 01:52:03.953]  They're stealing black votes, so they say we are.
[01:52:04.173 --> 01:52:06.094]  Right, and they're afraid because they're losing.
[01:52:06.314 --> 01:52:07.535]  They're losing the argument.
[01:52:07.635 --> 01:52:14.698]  I went and got my hair cut a couple days ago at a mainly black barbershop because it was a white barbershop when I was a little kid, but it's a black barbershop now.
[01:52:14.718 --> 01:52:15.559]  They were all listeners.
[01:52:16.139 --> 01:52:16.960]  And it's the same thing.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.700]  Like you said, 50 plus percent.
[01:52:18.801 --> 01:52:22.142]  I was at a grocery store and a bunch of black dudes came up to me yesterday.
[01:52:22.482 --> 01:52:23.823]  I mean, black folks love Trump.
[01:52:24.163 --> 01:52:27.385]  I mean, say what you want about Trump, but I mean, this BS isn't working.
[01:52:27.665 --> 01:52:28.105]  That's not.
[01:52:28.425 --> 01:52:29.386]  And that's why they're losing.
[01:52:29.406 --> 01:52:30.006]  And they know it.
[01:52:30.266 --> 01:52:31.747]  Which is why they stole the election.
[01:52:31.767 --> 01:52:33.187]  Because they were losing the election.
[01:52:33.548 --> 01:52:35.108]  That's why they had to shut down free speech.
[01:52:35.128 --> 01:52:38.270]  Because they're losing the argument in a free exchange of ideas.
[01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:38.750]  They can't win.
[01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:39.690]  So let me ask this question.
[01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:42.071]  The wheels are coming off Politico at Mets.
[01:52:42.211 --> 01:52:44.172]  Many rioters unlikely to serve jail.
[01:52:44.192 --> 01:52:45.333]  Because they did nothing wrong.
[01:52:45.413 --> 01:52:46.133]  What are they going to do now?
[01:52:47.846 --> 01:52:49.267]  I have no earthly idea what they're going to.
[01:52:49.307 --> 01:52:50.428]  Well, actually, I do know.
[01:52:51.088 --> 01:52:57.893]  So you've got the Time article from October of 2020, and it's 2023.
[01:52:57.993 --> 01:52:59.694]  Here's how we fix the global economy.
[01:53:00.294 --> 01:53:05.597]  And in this article, just at the beginning, they declare that on November 3rd,
[01:53:06.858 --> 01:53:10.622]  They've installed Joe Biden, and we've got a Democrat majority.
[01:53:10.642 --> 01:53:12.143]  I mean, they planned this.
[01:53:12.203 --> 01:53:13.024]  This is all staged.
[01:53:13.064 --> 01:53:13.644]  This is all planned out.
[01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:15.506]  They had another Time Magazine article, how they stole it.
[01:53:15.526 --> 01:53:16.187]  Did you see that one?
[01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:16.627]  Exactly.
[01:53:16.747 --> 01:53:18.509]  How like, oh, we set them up at the Capitol.
[01:53:18.529 --> 01:53:19.970]  Did you see that?
[01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.731]  Right.
[01:53:20.751 --> 01:53:21.751]  How we saved democracy.
[01:53:22.452 --> 01:53:26.617]  And it's AFL-CIO, which is I mean, I think they said AFL-CIO ran it all.
[01:53:26.797 --> 01:53:27.858]  Yeah, they ran it all.
[01:53:27.918 --> 01:53:32.944]  And actually, that's that's pretty true, according to all my sources that have kind of been on the ground the whole time.
[01:53:33.565 --> 01:53:38.750]  But in this article, though, they go on to even declare that by June of twenty twenty one.
[01:53:38.831 --> 01:53:41.233]  So this coming June, we're going to have
[01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:47.889]  Full global economic depression and we're going to have to start going back into corporate bailouts.
[01:53:47.909 --> 01:53:51.835]  But this time everybody's going to get a new wage and we're going to increase that and no more.
[01:53:52.296 --> 01:53:53.478]  It's the reset.
[01:53:54.039 --> 01:53:55.020]  The Great Reset.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.183]  What do they call it?
[01:53:57.223 --> 01:53:57.944]  Universal Income.
[01:53:58.665 --> 01:53:58.865]  Right.
[01:53:59.306 --> 01:54:06.892]  In fact, they say right here that there'll be mandatory a place on the board of each corporation for the workers.
[01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:09.675]  So you're starting to see... Oh, there's a shareholder while we screw you.
[01:54:10.015 --> 01:54:10.675]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:10.695 --> 01:54:12.077]  In fact, guys, can you pull the article up?
[01:54:12.117 --> 01:54:12.697]  Let me see it real quick.
[01:54:12.717 --> 01:54:13.478]  I'll show it to you viewers.
[01:54:13.998 --> 01:54:15.760]  I'll hand it back to you, Kelly.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.881]  Look at this overhead shot, guys.
[01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:20.422]  It's 2023, here's how we fix the global economy.
[01:54:20.682 --> 01:54:27.083]  So they put the economy into crisis, they shut it down, they bring in universal income to control people, put everybody on the dole.
[01:54:27.523 --> 01:54:29.824]  This is LBJ's Great Society for everybody.
[01:54:30.904 --> 01:54:33.565]  Combined with the compulsory Mark of the Beast.
[01:54:34.025 --> 01:54:39.406]  So you're going to have to take the mark and get the vaccine shot in order to work or do anything else.
[01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:40.527]  Oh yeah, they're announcing it.
[01:54:40.647 --> 01:54:41.767]  China runs it, by the way.
[01:54:42.366 --> 01:54:45.629]  And that's why we think that their weakness is being shown.
[01:54:45.929 --> 01:54:47.250]  They're speeding the timetable up.
[01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:49.612]  That's why it's important for us to understand what's coming.
[01:54:50.013 --> 01:54:56.498]  You should expect them to decouple the dollar from the world currency and kill the dollar this summer.
[01:54:56.518 --> 01:54:58.760]  And what you're going to have to do is become strong.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.482]  They want us divided and weak.
[01:55:00.922 --> 01:55:02.523]  We've got to unite and become strong.
[01:55:02.804 --> 01:55:09.670]  That means food and fuel and ammunition, clean water, the ability to self-sustain so you can resist
[01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:13.611]  The compulsory taking of the vaccine in order to eat.
[01:55:14.131 --> 01:55:18.773]  And I totally agree with you, Stuart and Kelly, but this is the main global assault.
[01:55:18.793 --> 01:55:19.853]  The beta testing is over.
[01:55:19.873 --> 01:55:21.494]  Do you agree this is the big assault?
[01:55:21.654 --> 01:55:22.034]  It is.
[01:55:22.434 --> 01:55:23.175]  And let it come.
[01:55:23.455 --> 01:55:24.735]  But make sure we're ready for it.
[01:55:24.755 --> 01:55:28.356]  Like Patrick Henry said, we have to see what's coming and then provide for it.
[01:55:28.376 --> 01:55:30.817]  Because they intended this all to be off air by now.
[01:55:31.538 --> 01:55:33.518]  They intended to run this while no one was on air.
[01:55:33.798 --> 01:55:35.059]  But still people are on air.
[01:55:35.119 --> 01:55:37.580]  But if listeners don't magnify this, we could lose.
[01:55:38.496 --> 01:55:42.018]  Well, it can only lose if Americans continue to sit and wait.
[01:55:42.258 --> 01:55:45.960]  That's why it's a mistake to wait until 2024 for Trump to run again.
[01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:47.201]  That's not going to happen.
[01:55:47.221 --> 01:55:48.222]  Oh yeah, they're never going to allow that.
[01:55:48.502 --> 01:55:49.362]  Right, it's not going to happen.
[01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:51.584]  Whatever's going to happen is going to happen pretty quick.
[01:55:51.984 --> 01:55:56.286]  So we need to just... So why are they making their move on Gates and others right now, Matt Gaetz?
[01:55:56.346 --> 01:55:57.587]  Same thing, a suppression campaign.
[01:55:57.807 --> 01:56:04.371]  They want to suppress and get you worried about, you know, the attacks from them so that you don't go on the attack.
[01:56:04.671 --> 01:56:05.111]  Exactly.
[01:56:05.151 --> 01:56:10.755]  They're worried about him going on the offense against Big Tech, against globalism, against the border, so they put that fake report out.
[01:56:11.075 --> 01:56:12.716]  Instead he should go on a rampage against them.
[01:56:12.956 --> 01:56:13.116]  Right.
[01:56:13.136 --> 01:56:14.237]  They want him sidelined.
[01:56:14.257 --> 01:56:16.318]  Like they want me sidelined, they want you sidelined.
[01:56:16.518 --> 01:56:18.659]  They want to put us on the defensive so we're not speaking out.
[01:56:18.919 --> 01:56:25.103]  We need to wake the American people up and get them all to understand that now is a time to stand up and get strong and get organized.
[01:56:25.784 --> 01:56:26.124]  I agree.
[01:56:26.184 --> 01:56:28.965]  Kelly, you're the counsel for Oath Keepers.
[01:56:28.985 --> 01:56:29.646]  What do you make of this?
[01:56:30.599 --> 01:56:31.340]  Well, I agree.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:33.641]  I think that's exactly, they're distracting everyone.
[01:56:33.661 --> 01:56:36.583]  So Gates is being distracted with what he has to defend himself with.
[01:56:37.944 --> 01:56:41.707]  I would also like to point out, because kind of how Stuart's talking about, we all need to be organized.
[01:56:41.747 --> 01:56:52.295]  Another thing is, is we need to go to, even if you re-elect new people, even if we miraculously somehow defeat their fraud that they're able to commit,
[01:56:53.413 --> 01:56:57.474]  We have to also pull out of all of the national organizations.
[01:56:57.554 --> 01:57:06.257]  So your governors need to get out of the National Governors Association, your lieutenant governors need to get out of their, you know, National Lieutenant Governors Association, all the way down to your mayors.
[01:57:06.857 --> 01:57:12.718]  That's exactly how they've infiltrated our- Oh yeah, it's the National Restaurant Association says, no more paper menu, you scan this.
[01:57:12.858 --> 01:57:15.119]  Oh now, can't come in if you don't have the scan.
[01:57:15.439 --> 01:57:16.479]  I mean, it's run by China.
[01:57:16.499 --> 01:57:19.020]  We used to have to break with every major institution.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:21.861]  Tell them about what you saw when you were, when COVID first hit.
[01:57:22.421 --> 01:57:23.962]  Okay, so that was a good example.
[01:57:24.002 --> 01:57:30.046]  So at the time, I actually worked for a firm in Granbury that we had the city attorney contract.
[01:57:30.426 --> 01:57:38.071]  And during that, at the very beginning, like within a few weeks after COVID hit, the lockdowns, we're talking about everywhere we're going.
[01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:50.381]  Chamber of Commerce rolls out, basically, the Texas future, which, you know, is putting us all in, literally, the Agenda 21 Texas triangle.
[01:57:50.441 --> 01:57:57.028]  So it's basically explaining that there's not going to be resources outside of that triangle after, you know, COVID, after we recover.
[01:57:57.108 --> 01:57:59.030]  That original triangle, they put that out.
[01:57:59.070 --> 01:57:59.450]  Correct.
[01:57:59.530 --> 01:57:59.971]  Correct.
[01:58:00.011 --> 01:58:01.813]  That was rolled out two weeks
[01:58:02.133 --> 01:58:10.526]  This whole plan was rolled out two weeks after COVID started, and we're sitting there like, oh, okay, yeah, that's exactly where this came from.
[01:58:10.546 --> 01:58:15.154]  For those who don't know, they put a triangle in the middle of the state saying, no one will be allowed to operate outside this.
[01:58:15.434 --> 01:58:15.715]  Correct.
[01:58:17.162 --> 01:58:17.662]  That's the plan.
[01:58:17.882 --> 01:58:18.703]  Texas is signed on.
[01:58:19.103 --> 01:58:20.723]  That's how you knew it was Buck from the beginning.
[01:58:20.743 --> 01:58:21.403]  That's how I knew.
[01:58:21.563 --> 01:58:23.184]  And Greg Abbott is on that, man.
[01:58:23.264 --> 01:58:23.824]  Exactly.
[01:58:24.124 --> 01:58:24.344]  Yeah.
[01:58:24.805 --> 01:58:25.165]  Exactly.
[01:58:25.185 --> 01:58:29.786]  All right, let's talk about, guys, pull up the Agenda 21 Texas triangle for folks that don't know.
[01:58:29.846 --> 01:58:30.126]  Wow.
[01:58:30.406 --> 01:58:34.128]  And you're a lawyer at the city level being shown those in Granbury.
[01:58:34.368 --> 01:58:34.508]  Correct.
[01:58:34.528 --> 01:58:35.828]  That's, by the way, where I'm from in Dallas.
[01:58:36.108 --> 01:58:42.911]  So you're an attorney at a major Texas city up by Dallas, and you're shown, oh, the COVID lockdown.
[01:58:42.951 --> 01:58:46.432]  It's all Agenda 21, the official maps from 10 years ago.
[01:58:46.992 --> 01:58:50.473]  Stuart Rose is here, founder of Wealth Keepers, constitutional lawyer.
[01:58:51.313 --> 01:58:52.533]  Kelly Sorrell is here as well.
[01:58:52.733 --> 01:58:53.854]  Please continue, this is big.
[01:58:54.214 --> 01:59:01.556]  Okay, so they obviously identify that it's Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, down to San Antonio, incorporates Austin.
[01:59:01.836 --> 01:59:04.977]  So you've got that giant triangle, you can see it down there, the Texas triangle.
[01:59:05.017 --> 01:59:06.237]  And that's in the U.N.
[01:59:06.257 --> 01:59:06.657]  plans.
[01:59:07.057 --> 01:59:11.199]  Yeah, and that's literally... And then later they tell you, years later, this is the plan for COVID.
[01:59:11.699 --> 01:59:19.362]  Yeah, and literally that's in our new economy, our new stability post-COVID era, is going to look like this.
[01:59:19.422 --> 01:59:27.025]  And so in this it also tells us about basically there's not going to be any resources outside of the triangle, so there's not going to be any... Which is a globalist model.
[01:59:27.065 --> 01:59:31.587]  They cut off all the resources, though they still tax the areas for the central district.
[01:59:31.907 --> 01:59:32.087]  Right.
[01:59:32.247 --> 01:59:33.848]  Which is what China has a similar model.
[01:59:34.949 --> 01:59:38.178]  Only this part of China on the coast gets power.
[01:59:38.198 --> 01:59:38.940]  Everybody else doesn't.
[01:59:39.574 --> 01:59:46.617]  Yeah, so you're not going to have hospitals, you're not going to have employers moving in there, you're not going to have the university systems, you're not going to have any of that.
[01:59:46.637 --> 01:59:47.037]  Put it back up, folks.
[01:59:47.077 --> 01:59:47.258]  Show them.
[01:59:47.278 --> 01:59:48.398]  This is literal Hunger Games.
[01:59:48.918 --> 01:59:49.819]  Yep, exactly right.
[01:59:49.839 --> 01:59:51.039]  Keep going.
[01:59:51.359 --> 01:59:59.883]  And they also, like, go in to tell us that, like, the hospital system that we're going to, our new major employers are going to be Baylor Scott & White and HEB and Walmart.
[02:00:00.223 --> 02:00:02.625]  So, I mean, they're telling us, here's where everybody's going to work.
[02:00:03.105 --> 02:00:04.145]  We're all going to probably get our food.
[02:00:04.165 --> 02:00:06.726]  You're like, wait a minute, I saw this on the Alex Jones Show ten years ago.
[02:00:06.867 --> 02:00:07.307]  Exactly.
[02:00:09.027 --> 02:00:10.508]  Or in, you know, Hunger Games.
[02:00:10.648 --> 02:00:11.088]  Exactly.
[02:00:11.128 --> 02:00:11.809]  No, I mean, yeah.
[02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:15.170]  So anyway, and that's where we rolled out.
[02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:17.351]  But then I also want to point this out real quick.
[02:00:17.471 --> 02:00:19.212]  That was two weeks after COVID hit.
[02:00:19.472 --> 02:00:21.733]  Yeah, that was within... Yeah, they didn't just... It was all ready.
[02:00:21.793 --> 02:00:25.875]  It was like... Yeah, and you're kind of just going like, oh yeah, because... Explain what that means.
[02:00:25.915 --> 02:00:27.456]  This was not... This was already developed.
[02:00:27.756 --> 02:00:28.296]  This was ready.
[02:00:28.536 --> 02:00:31.797]  Right, and I mean obviously this slideshow didn't just pop up in that two weeks.
[02:00:31.817 --> 02:00:35.319]  Somebody had this giant brilliant idea that this is what we were going to do.
[02:00:35.559 --> 02:00:44.682]  Obviously told me this is a planned scam-demic where we are going to revolutionize our country, join the global agenda, and give up our sovereignty.
[02:00:44.702 --> 02:00:46.023]  And this is going to be our new normal.
[02:00:46.223 --> 02:00:49.244]  And that's what they've worked towards ever since.
[02:00:49.304 --> 02:00:51.905]  I mean we've seen it with the rollout of the vaccine.
[02:00:52.125 --> 02:00:54.226]  That's how you lost your job with the city, right?
[02:00:54.566 --> 02:00:57.687]  Yeah, because I started going nuts because I joined Open Texas Rallies.
[02:00:57.747 --> 02:00:58.268]  I was down.
[02:00:58.288 --> 02:01:00.669]  I quit masking.
[02:01:00.769 --> 02:01:02.429]  I didn't care about their lockdowns.
[02:01:02.469 --> 02:01:03.550]  I was actually refusing.
[02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:07.672]  I got into non-compliance and then found the rest of the crazies right along with me.
[02:01:07.752 --> 02:01:09.693]  So yeah, it's been fun ever since.
[02:01:09.713 --> 02:01:15.195]  What's incredible is they admit it all and we're supposed to just not face it and just go along with it.
[02:01:16.448 --> 02:01:21.990]  Well, what they're hoping to do is to make you sit down and become full of despair.
[02:01:22.890 --> 02:01:29.532]  They want us, who are aware of what they're doing, to feel like there's nothing we can do about it, so we might as well just roll over and give up.
[02:01:29.952 --> 02:01:31.973]  And by the way, you were saying in the break, they want to scare you.
[02:01:32.013 --> 02:01:33.133]  You didn't do an insurrection.
[02:01:33.553 --> 02:01:36.094]  You're an American patriot, a veteran, a father, a lawyer.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:37.754]  You said, I'm ready to take my lumps.
[02:01:37.994 --> 02:01:39.375]  They don't like the fact that we're not scared.
[02:01:40.015 --> 02:01:42.496]  Nah, and that's what you have to do, the opposite of what they want you to do.
[02:01:42.836 --> 02:01:47.257]  They want you to be suppressed in silence and shut up and be afraid, so you gotta speak up.
[02:01:47.597 --> 02:01:53.439]  I have an obligation and duty to lead by example and stand up and speak out, even if they might slam me into a jail cell.
[02:01:53.459 --> 02:01:55.080]  That's what they want me to do, is shut up.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:55.780]  Same goes for you.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:04.603]  It's important for all Americans, though, to realize that the one thing they fear most is all of us coming together and standing up united and refusing to comply.
[02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:07.106]  They fear the mass non-compliance.
[02:02:07.346 --> 02:02:08.207]  They also fear the U.S.
[02:02:08.267 --> 02:02:08.627]  military.
[02:02:08.647 --> 02:02:11.030]  That's why I sent you that video about what they're being shown in the military now.
[02:02:11.311 --> 02:02:12.652]  We'll pull that up next.
[02:02:12.672 --> 02:02:13.133]  Do they have it?
[02:02:13.513 --> 02:02:13.914]  Yeah, they do.
[02:02:14.234 --> 02:02:15.075]  We'll play that next segment.
[02:02:15.095 --> 02:02:22.404]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is trying to indoctrinate the military to hate America, to think America is inherently racist.
[02:02:22.624 --> 02:02:24.046]  Don't you think that'll backfire?
[02:02:24.386 --> 02:02:25.607]  Oh, it's already backfiring.
[02:02:25.887 --> 02:02:29.630]  The troops who we talked to about this see it's all a bunch of bunk.
[02:02:29.650 --> 02:02:30.331]  They don't believe it.
[02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:31.232]  They know it's nonsense.
[02:02:31.472 --> 02:02:32.253]  So it's too late.
[02:02:32.273 --> 02:02:34.574]  That's the problem, is their propaganda's not working.
[02:02:34.895 --> 02:02:36.496]  It didn't work in the majority of Americans.
[02:02:36.516 --> 02:02:37.957]  It's not working in the majority of the troops.
[02:02:38.237 --> 02:02:44.983]  That's why they had to steal the election, because they were losing the hearts and minds of the majority of the people, and they've already lost the hearts and minds of the military.
[02:02:45.343 --> 02:02:49.347]  All this is doing is making more of the military upset, because they can see right through it.
[02:02:49.647 --> 02:02:50.728]  And so they have a serious problem.
[02:02:51.008 --> 02:02:53.150]  So what they do have, though, is hunger.
[02:02:53.650 --> 02:02:55.052]  That's why Hunger Games is so important.
[02:02:55.412 --> 02:03:03.261]  They're going to try to use a crash of the dollar and forced hunger and starvation on the American people just as they did to the Kulaks in Russia.
[02:03:03.281 --> 02:03:03.521]  That's right.
[02:03:03.541 --> 02:03:04.723]  We're being prepared for collapse.
[02:03:04.743 --> 02:03:05.143]  That's right.
[02:03:05.163 --> 02:03:07.065]  They're going to use the same Bolshevik model.
[02:03:07.085 --> 02:03:07.506]  Explain that.
[02:03:08.507 --> 02:03:16.014]  Russia, to break the backs of the independent farmers, they confiscated their farms, they confiscated all the grain, they starved them out.
[02:03:16.314 --> 02:03:18.936]  Even though they could grow their own food, they confiscated all of it.
[02:03:19.217 --> 02:03:21.018]  So you'll see that happen in the United States.
[02:03:21.038 --> 02:03:24.281]  They're going to attempt to crush the backs of rural America.
[02:03:24.321 --> 02:03:25.783]  Denver says the Kulaks were not armed.
[02:03:26.283 --> 02:03:29.525]  We're not looking for a fight, but the key is at that point we have a right to defense.
[02:03:29.625 --> 02:03:30.706]  Exactly right, well said.
[02:03:31.046 --> 02:03:52.042]  So that's why Jena 21 is being used, or being implemented through COVID-19, is they're using COVID as their excuse to scare the people in the city to support it, that you must go out there and break the backs and suppress these horrible, you know, non-maskers out in the country, these horrible racists, these horrible, you know, fascists, what they call us all out here.
[02:03:52.602 --> 02:03:52.742]  Yeah.
[02:04:07.619 --> 02:04:09.681]  Sure, you seem empowered by them trying to put you in prison.
[02:04:33.158 --> 02:04:48.521]  Well, you gotta come to a realization that it's not about me, it's not about any of us, that it's really, like I was just giving a speech the other day to a local group, I said, you gotta always keep in mind who came before you and who comes after you.
[02:04:48.801 --> 02:04:50.602]  Before us were all the men that fought and died.
[02:04:50.882 --> 02:04:57.443]  Go to your vet in the cemetery and go look at those graves and think about what they sacrificed, and then think about your children and grandchildren coming after you.
[02:04:57.863 --> 02:04:59.424]  So you're nothing compared to that.
[02:04:59.664 --> 02:05:00.824]  I agree, and here's my issue.
[02:05:01.724 --> 02:05:07.328]  If the globalists were like the Romans invading a place, building aqueducts and farms and things, they weren't perfect.
[02:05:07.348 --> 02:05:08.889]  They conquered you, but they gave you something better.
[02:05:08.909 --> 02:05:10.670]  I'd be like, okay, I'm not going to die for this.
[02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:14.853]  This is a pedophile, satanic world government that wants to kill everybody?
[02:05:15.813 --> 02:05:17.975]  All you can do is fight it, Stuart.
[02:05:18.055 --> 02:05:19.936]  It's like, this is bad.
[02:05:19.996 --> 02:05:23.058]  This is not some superior group coming and taking us over.
[02:05:23.338 --> 02:05:24.259]  I would just work with them.
[02:05:24.279 --> 02:05:25.239]  I'd adopt what they were doing.
[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.581]  If something superior came along, it's not superior.
[02:05:28.706 --> 02:05:31.972]  No, it's a throwback to the worst in humanity, worst in human history.
[02:05:32.012 --> 02:05:33.595]  What would you define this thing as then?
[02:05:34.397 --> 02:05:35.478]  Totalitarian nightmare.
[02:05:37.346 --> 02:05:37.926]  That's what they are.
[02:05:38.386 --> 02:05:39.127]  But they're weak.
[02:05:40.567 --> 02:05:46.390]  Like I said when I first started Oath Keepers, I don't think David Rockefeller knows how to fly an F-16 or drive an Abrams tank.
[02:05:46.630 --> 02:05:51.292]  They can't do it without you, without the troops, without the guys following their orders.
[02:05:51.472 --> 02:05:52.433]  That's the whole point of Oath Keepers.
[02:05:52.453 --> 02:05:53.533]  They don't even know, like George Bush Sr.
[02:05:53.553 --> 02:05:55.314]  didn't know how to run a scanner at a grocery store.
[02:05:55.734 --> 02:06:00.476]  They don't know how to change baby diapers, plant food, roof a house, run electrical.
[02:06:00.956 --> 02:06:02.277]  Why do we let them run us then?
[02:06:03.524 --> 02:06:05.045]  False sense of authority.
[02:06:05.505 --> 02:06:06.505]  But that's being eroded.
[02:06:06.785 --> 02:06:08.466]  Their own credibility is being destroyed.
[02:06:08.866 --> 02:06:15.128]  That's the problem, is that everything they do to try to suppress us destroys the credibility, and especially in the eyes of the troops.
[02:06:15.568 --> 02:06:16.588]  And they're starting to lose that.
[02:06:16.608 --> 02:06:18.129]  That's why they want to replace them with robots.
[02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:21.090]  Ultimately, if we let them... Yeah, they're in a race to robots.
[02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:25.932]  So what they want is they want to suppress us, but they don't want to go so hard that we jump out of the pot.
[02:06:25.952 --> 02:06:32.614]  They want to keep us, you know, placated enough that we stay in the pot while they continue to turn the heat up and keep us suppressed, keep the lid on it.
[02:06:33.194 --> 02:06:34.815]  But what we've got to do is hop out of the pot.
[02:06:35.095 --> 02:06:41.497]  But if they were so powerful, why would all the globals be moving to New Zealand, and Kauai, Hawaii, and Tasmania, Australia?
[02:06:42.318 --> 02:06:44.819]  They're all scared, actually, Stuart, which shows me they're weak.
[02:06:45.119 --> 02:06:47.640]  They were such powerful leaders, they'd be at the front lines.
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:49.921]  Right, so that's why we have to recognize their weakness.
[02:06:50.101 --> 02:07:00.245]  And, you know, it's important to point out all the bad things they're doing, but we've also got to say this is because they're weak, because they're desperate, that's why the speed of time lined up, that's why the mask is coming off, they have no other choice.
[02:07:01.493 --> 02:07:06.655]  All right, let's talk about Oath Keepers and where this goes and where America goes, because who knows how long we'll be on air.
[02:07:07.015 --> 02:07:08.555]  We have our own radio and TV uplinks.
[02:07:08.936 --> 02:07:12.137]  We're reaching millions of people right now, but I don't take this for granted.
[02:07:12.177 --> 02:07:13.617]  This could be our last show today, folks.
[02:07:14.097 --> 02:07:16.458]  Any minute could be our last time, but that's okay.
[02:07:16.738 --> 02:07:18.559]  We've planted trillions of seeds.
[02:07:19.019 --> 02:07:19.699]  You've done that.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.000]  We've done that together.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:22.901]  How do people contact you?
[02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:25.742]  Because they all think of the internet, social media as a way to contact.
[02:07:25.782 --> 02:07:26.742]  How do people find you guys?
[02:07:27.102 --> 02:07:32.346]  This is OathKeepers.org and I would encourage you to go to OathKeepers.org forward slash donate and support us.
[02:07:32.407 --> 02:07:33.688]  Right now we've been deplatformed.
[02:07:33.968 --> 02:07:35.469]  We can't even take credit cards online.
[02:07:35.489 --> 02:07:36.590]  We're working to fix that.
[02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:37.251]  I understand.
[02:07:37.451 --> 02:07:43.216]  But meanwhile, our goal, my goal is to speak out now because I don't know, they might silence me.
[02:07:43.616 --> 02:07:45.357]  So I want to make sure that I say what I need to say.
[02:07:45.377 --> 02:07:46.759]  I just did a video last night.
[02:07:46.779 --> 02:07:51.342]  I'm going to put out a two hour class on local organization, how to get strong locally.
[02:07:51.623 --> 02:07:55.486]  That's going to be my focus is teaching Americans what I know we've learned over the years.
[02:07:55.666 --> 02:07:55.946]  That's right.
[02:07:55.966 --> 02:07:57.108]  So things are going to go dark.
[02:07:57.268 --> 02:07:57.989]  We have to get ready now.
[02:07:58.169 --> 02:07:58.549]  That's right.
[02:07:58.769 --> 02:08:00.611]  You've got to have... Folks, you've already got the knowledge.
[02:08:01.352 --> 02:08:01.753]  Oh, sure.
[02:08:01.773 --> 02:08:05.136]  You've got plenty of folks that have the knowledge, but you've got to get your communities ready.
[02:08:05.176 --> 02:08:06.077]  The founders did that.
[02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:08.100]  They got ready for what they knew was coming.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:09.661]  They formed their Minuteman companies.
[02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:10.562]  They formed their militias.
[02:08:10.843 --> 02:08:11.924]  They got strong locally.
[02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:12.665]  That's what we need to do.
[02:08:12.685 --> 02:08:14.967]  But can you not feel God's strength building?
[02:08:15.027 --> 02:08:16.288]  Like, it's powerful.
[02:08:16.909 --> 02:08:18.150]  Sure, if you let go of fear.
[02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:20.111]  That's why you have to focus on love.
[02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:22.773]  Your love of your family, your love of your country.
[02:08:23.174 --> 02:08:25.936]  You know, you've got to focus on the love of the brother next to you.
[02:08:26.356 --> 02:08:27.537]  That's what cancels out fear.
[02:08:27.957 --> 02:08:29.138]  And they want you to be afraid.
[02:08:29.158 --> 02:08:31.580]  That's why, really, you've got to turn the TV off.
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:33.942]  You've got to do what you have to do to know what's going on.
[02:08:34.322 --> 02:08:35.623]  Other than that, shut it off.
[02:08:35.923 --> 02:08:37.524]  Because all it does is feed fear.
[02:08:37.844 --> 02:08:38.465]  It grows fear.
[02:08:41.807 --> 02:08:43.789]  Well, I just feel the energy of an explosion.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.641]  I want to tell all the Globalists and all their minions though, you have reaped the whirlwind.
[02:08:49.821 --> 02:08:54.042]  All hell is about to break loose as we are here in the year 2021.
[02:08:54.382 --> 02:08:56.783]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:08:56.823 --> 02:08:57.983]  Two more segments with our guest.
[02:08:58.423 --> 02:08:59.624]  The next guest host takes over.
[02:09:00.684 --> 02:09:04.465]  Kelly Sorrell and Stuart Rhodes are here with us.
[02:09:05.525 --> 02:09:07.726]  And I cannot imagine a better place to be.
[02:09:09.431 --> 02:09:10.871]  There's key time in time.
[02:09:11.472 --> 02:09:13.912]  Kelly, tell us about this Key Time Magazine article.
[02:09:14.332 --> 02:09:15.873]  Okay, so I was just going to continue on.
[02:09:15.893 --> 02:09:25.756]  So we had in June of 2021, I guess we're going to look at more corporate bailouts and the $15 minimum wage and, you know, our new companies emerge as our
[02:09:26.556 --> 02:09:49.493]  Is our last remaining box change the final final nail in the coffin of mom and pop shops Main Street, but then we get to look forward after that to the summer of 2022 and which we end up with our giant climate crisis that turns apocalyptic and we get to look at a severe drought in the Midwestern US.
[02:09:49.533 --> 02:09:51.654]  So I guess we're going to have actually an engineered.
[02:09:52.515 --> 02:09:56.161]  Climate event or something where they... Because they love to brag in these documents.
[02:09:56.902 --> 02:10:01.129]  But in basic criminology, Stuart, but also Kelly, psychos love to brag.
[02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.810]  They're obsessed with it.
[02:10:02.705 --> 02:10:04.726]  Sure, it's part of their ego, right?
[02:10:05.406 --> 02:10:07.787]  So it says here that in the Midwestern U.S.
[02:10:07.827 --> 02:10:12.128]  a severe drought wiped out crops that supplied one-sixth of the world's grain output.
[02:10:12.529 --> 02:10:19.851]  People woke up to the need for governments to form a coordinated response to climate change and direct global fiscal stimulus in support of a green economy.
[02:10:19.871 --> 02:10:27.874]  So the climate, the COVID lockdown creates a starvation, then they create a global core of UN to get you food since they cut the food off.
[02:10:28.214 --> 02:10:28.434]  Right.
[02:10:28.814 --> 02:10:29.075]  Right.
[02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:33.197]  And now we'll have the Great Green New Deal will come out.
[02:10:34.038 --> 02:10:42.403]  And I assume that also means we have to have our vaccine passport to be able to benefit from the UN bringing us all of our food.
[02:10:42.683 --> 02:10:44.064]  God, this is so diabolical.
[02:10:46.986 --> 02:10:49.908]  So the way out of this, tell them about your art program.
[02:10:50.393 --> 02:11:07.881]  Oh, so one of the things that kind of after, and actually this actually rolled out of the Agenda 21, I kind of, garbage from last year, about a year ago, I came up with and several others of us started discussing what we call ARC, which is Americans Refusing Compliance.
[02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:12.263]  And it's going to be basically, what we need to do is start coordinating with other states.
[02:11:12.883 --> 02:11:18.205]  And being aware we're under, exactly, we're under a UN Agenda 2030 assault, say no.
[02:11:18.705 --> 02:11:19.626]  Recognize the assault.
[02:11:20.446 --> 02:11:27.988]  And we need to also get out of the system and start creating our own trade or barter lines with other people that are refusing compliance.
[02:11:28.008 --> 02:11:28.468]  And I agree.
[02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:34.630]  Even if you weren't a moral person, as a sociopath, the whole future is going to be barter and outside this B system.
[02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:35.030]  Right.
[02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:37.511]  Because we're not going to have the digital currency.
[02:11:37.531 --> 02:11:38.351]  We're not going to have the mark.
[02:11:38.391 --> 02:11:39.752]  We're not going to... Well, I'm not.
[02:11:39.792 --> 02:11:40.132]  I don't know.
[02:11:40.432 --> 02:11:42.393]  Some people... A lot of people aren't going to be allowed to have it.
[02:11:42.493 --> 02:11:43.533]  This is obviously, you know...
[02:11:44.264 --> 02:11:45.746]  Yeah, they want you to starve to death.
[02:11:46.106 --> 02:11:49.089]  So what you've got to do is understand what they're trying to do.
[02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:51.512]  They were trying to force you into the cities.
[02:11:51.852 --> 02:11:53.934]  If you want a job, if you want to eat, you've got to go into the cities.
[02:11:53.974 --> 02:11:55.896]  The future is resistance against everything they do.
[02:11:55.936 --> 02:11:56.297]  Lay it out.
[02:11:56.417 --> 02:11:57.939]  So you go do the exact opposite.
[02:11:57.959 --> 02:11:59.340]  If you live in a city, get out of the cities.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:00.521]  Go to the country.
[02:12:00.561 --> 02:12:00.802]  Exactly.
[02:12:00.822 --> 02:12:02.944]  They want you to go to the city, give all your power to it.
[02:12:02.984 --> 02:12:03.665]  No, leave now.
[02:12:03.685 --> 02:12:04.646]  Leave now.
[02:12:05.326 --> 02:12:07.507]  Every instinct I've got is leave, leave, leave.
[02:12:07.587 --> 02:12:07.967]  Get out.
[02:12:08.027 --> 02:12:08.707]  Get out of the cities.
[02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:13.008]  Better to be a guy pumping gas in a small town America.
[02:12:13.088 --> 02:12:13.588]  Exactly.
[02:12:13.668 --> 02:12:14.868]  With your own chickens and your own dogs.
[02:12:14.888 --> 02:12:16.969]  And your children not learning how to be a, you know, exactly.
[02:12:17.289 --> 02:12:17.449]  Right.
[02:12:17.809 --> 02:12:22.070]  Better to be living like that than to be some rich guy with a BMW in a city.
[02:12:22.090 --> 02:12:23.290]  Because that's all false.
[02:12:23.530 --> 02:12:26.751]  That's all going to collapse and you'll be eating cockroach sandwiches.
[02:12:27.651 --> 02:12:34.520]  He better be a guy running a shredder tractor with his children not learning to be devil worshipers and living in a shack than being in the city.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.521]  Exactly right.
[02:12:35.941 --> 02:12:40.767]  So get out, you know, be in the country where you need to be, where they don't want you to be and get strong there.
[02:12:41.128 --> 02:12:43.270]  Unite with your neighbors, grow your own food.
[02:12:43.290 --> 02:12:45.173]  And you're going to learn, the people are in the country, they're ready.
[02:12:45.393 --> 02:12:45.713]  They know.
[02:12:46.133 --> 02:12:46.514]  They do.
[02:12:46.654 --> 02:12:48.795]  But they gotta start storing food up and fuel.
[02:12:48.815 --> 02:12:49.415]  You'll need fuel.
[02:12:49.455 --> 02:12:50.175]  You'll need medicine.
[02:12:50.415 --> 02:12:51.316]  You'll need radios.
[02:12:51.556 --> 02:12:52.316]  You'll need ammunition.
[02:12:52.336 --> 02:12:54.317]  You'll need all those resources to fly fast.
[02:12:54.337 --> 02:12:55.738]  Well, my gut's never been wrong, Stuart.
[02:12:55.758 --> 02:12:57.738]  And my gut is demanding I leave.
[02:12:58.119 --> 02:12:59.599]  It's like, you will leave!
[02:12:59.919 --> 02:13:00.800]  You will go to the country!
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:02.100]  You will arm up now!
[02:13:02.561 --> 02:13:03.881]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:13:03.901 --> 02:13:06.342]  My gut is literally ordering me to do this.
[02:13:06.682 --> 02:13:07.263]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:07.283 --> 02:13:07.623]  Stay with us.
[02:13:10.214 --> 02:13:15.602]  Alright, we got Stuart Rhodes here with his Constitutional Lawyer and Chief Oat Keeper's Counsel.
[02:13:16.764 --> 02:13:19.367]  You guys lay out what you were just saying about getting out of the state.
[02:13:19.407 --> 02:13:20.228]  He's getting ready right now.
[02:13:22.323 --> 02:13:35.019]  I just believe that everybody, I think this is biblical and I think this is already, you know, so we just need to be able to hunker down in groups, still be able to find other like-minded people in the country and continue to work with them the best we can.
[02:13:35.559 --> 02:13:39.744]  And, you know, it's funny because there's articles already out regarding fake
[02:13:40.405 --> 02:13:41.006]  We're good to go.
[02:14:02.304 --> 02:14:03.584]  Give up your creature comfort.
[02:14:03.764 --> 02:14:07.085]  And if you're an attorney, you know, quit cowering to the system.
[02:14:07.105 --> 02:14:08.706]  You know, get out there and fight.
[02:14:08.806 --> 02:14:09.906]  This is our last chance.
[02:14:10.126 --> 02:14:13.267]  And I mean, we've only got a few more months and I'm kind of standing alone.
[02:14:13.347 --> 02:14:17.988]  There's there's a very few of us that are actually standing up and saying, wait a minute, I love my constitution.
[02:14:18.008 --> 02:14:19.308]  I love my country.
[02:14:19.328 --> 02:14:24.049]  I love my fellow man, you know, and I'm willing to stand up and say something about it.
[02:14:24.209 --> 02:14:25.690]  Shelley Sorrell, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:28.252]  It's not satisfying.
[02:14:28.292 --> 02:14:29.253]  It's actually disgusting.
[02:14:29.673 --> 02:14:32.577]  But at a weird level, there's a little bit of satisfaction.
[02:14:33.178 --> 02:14:34.380]  Like, the games are over.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:35.281]  The war is here.
[02:14:35.361 --> 02:14:36.162]  We're now here.
[02:14:36.523 --> 02:14:37.224]  We were right.
[02:14:37.364 --> 02:14:39.346]  This is actually happening.
[02:14:39.587 --> 02:14:40.828]  We're not in beta anymore.
[02:14:40.848 --> 02:14:41.669]  We're in operations.
[02:14:42.534 --> 02:14:42.934]  That's right.
[02:14:42.954 --> 02:14:44.095]  You've got to embrace the suck.
[02:14:44.115 --> 02:14:46.657]  You've got to say, OK, this is why we're here.
[02:14:46.677 --> 02:14:50.160]  This is why we were born at this time in this country.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:53.623]  And it's not to live on our knees, but to stand and fight on our feet.
[02:14:54.124 --> 02:14:55.785]  And so we have to do what the founders did.
[02:14:56.105 --> 02:14:57.546]  Walk the same path they walked.
[02:14:57.887 --> 02:14:59.068]  They got strong locally.
[02:14:59.628 --> 02:15:01.289]  They got strong in the local communities.
[02:15:01.469 --> 02:15:05.410]  They prepared themselves, not just with guns and ammunition, but also with food.
[02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:11.333]  Some of the stores being stored at Concord were large barrels full of food, grain and salted fish.
[02:15:12.153 --> 02:15:16.254]  What do you make of the idiots that serve this when they're being used?
[02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.535]  It's so pathetic.
[02:15:17.975 --> 02:15:19.416]  Well, you've got to feel sorry for them in a way.
[02:15:19.536 --> 02:15:20.957]  You know, they're the useful idiots.
[02:15:21.097 --> 02:15:22.638]  But, you know, a lot of them are waking up.
[02:15:22.758 --> 02:15:27.680]  So one thing that we have to be mindful of is that we're being artificially divided and conquered.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.021]  And you saw a massive walk-away movement.
[02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:31.222]  It's still growing.
[02:15:31.622 --> 02:15:34.144]  The Democratic Party is bleeding out.
[02:15:34.424 --> 02:15:35.204]  It's done.
[02:15:35.224 --> 02:15:36.085]  That's why they stole the election.
[02:15:36.385 --> 02:15:36.485]  Right.
[02:15:36.505 --> 02:15:37.145]  That's why they had to.
[02:15:37.465 --> 02:15:39.046]  So they're still bleeding people.
[02:15:39.827 --> 02:15:40.307]  Exactly.
[02:15:40.467 --> 02:15:42.608]  All of this offensive is like Battle of the Bulge.
[02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:43.609]  It's their failure.
[02:15:44.329 --> 02:15:51.518]  Right, it's their final, good point, it's a good analogy, it's their final counterattack to try to shut us down before we get too strong.
[02:15:51.758 --> 02:15:52.519]  But it's too late.
[02:15:52.859 --> 02:15:56.704]  So they're bleeding out, they're bleeding credibility, they're losing the rank and file.
[02:15:56.724 --> 02:15:59.507]  They're taking leaders and crushing them, saying, look, you're being defeated.
[02:15:59.948 --> 02:16:02.010]  Our leader's destruction is a sign of our strength.
[02:16:02.932 --> 02:16:04.373]  Well, it's a sign of their fear.
[02:16:05.153 --> 02:16:09.976]  And that's why we've got to get past the hero worship also and celebrity worship.
[02:16:10.016 --> 02:16:19.220]  Too many people, and God bless President Trump and others like Matt Gaetz, that's all great, but the most important leaders are you and your own town.
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:19.620]  That's right.
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.361]  You can't put all the stock in them.
[02:16:21.381 --> 02:16:24.883]  That's why they target leaders, is because they think if they destroy a leader, you give up.
[02:16:25.183 --> 02:16:28.224]  Right, so that's what they're trying to do is cut off the head of the snake or suppress you.
[02:16:28.765 --> 02:16:30.425]  So, you know, they want to use that as an example.
[02:16:30.525 --> 02:16:32.186]  Don't stand up or this could happen to you.
[02:16:32.566 --> 02:16:33.647]  So don't let that control you.
[02:16:33.707 --> 02:16:41.030]  Understand that it's a badge of honor to be a martyr, like a Christian martyr, or to be someone that's suppressed because you know you're over the target when you get in the flack.
[02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:42.691]  So stand up to your local communities.
[02:16:43.011 --> 02:16:43.951]  Ignore what they say.
[02:16:43.971 --> 02:16:45.572]  I don't read social media.
[02:16:45.592 --> 02:16:49.073]  I don't read, you know, The Washington Post writes articles about me or BuzzFeed.
[02:16:49.093 --> 02:16:50.354]  I don't even bother reading them.
[02:16:50.874 --> 02:16:54.956]  Because I know all that's in there is a bunch of junk, a bunch of garbage, meant to demoralize me.
[02:16:54.976 --> 02:16:58.038]  Well, how dumb are they going to feel when it all falls and they sold out?
[02:16:58.298 --> 02:16:59.099]  They're idiots!
[02:16:59.559 --> 02:17:01.820]  I mean, we lose the Republic, it's all over!
[02:17:02.341 --> 02:17:03.741]  Well, they won't know until it's too late.
[02:17:04.162 --> 02:17:09.225]  It does us no good at all to gloat over, you know, their final realization before they get the bullet in the back of the head.
[02:17:09.245 --> 02:17:10.405]  And Kelly, you're a beautiful case.
[02:17:10.425 --> 02:17:13.707]  A year and a half ago, you're a mainline lawyer, a Christian, a conservative.
[02:17:13.727 --> 02:17:15.048]  You see the truth, you go public.
[02:17:15.348 --> 02:17:16.369]  Now you're in the middle of the fight.
[02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:17.970]  What do you want to impart to viewers?
[02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.938]  I just, I love Trump.
[02:17:21.058 --> 02:17:36.882]  I mean, I was in Michigan with Trump, with the lawyer team, and you know, we, I know, I know they stole this election, and I actually represent Latinos for Trump, Blacks for Trump in a suit, which I can't get legal assistance from other attorneys to continue.
[02:17:38.911 --> 02:17:42.353]  But the point is, is everybody has to realize that Trump was one man.
[02:17:43.153 --> 02:17:44.794]  The movement behind Trump is all of us.
[02:17:44.854 --> 02:17:46.095]  And we still have that voice.
[02:17:46.135 --> 02:17:47.836]  We still have that ability to stand up.
[02:17:47.876 --> 02:17:49.177]  We still have a chance to rally.
[02:17:49.237 --> 02:17:49.657]  Exactly.
[02:17:49.677 --> 02:17:53.279]  It wasn't that he wasn't strong when they tricked us to say he was doing it all.
[02:17:53.339 --> 02:17:53.519]  No.
[02:17:53.899 --> 02:17:55.460]  We had to move to give him the power.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:56.100]  Correct.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:06.285]  And I think actually Stuart has talked about doing base rallies to try to keep the troops with us and standing for the Constitution and obeying their oath.
[02:18:06.825 --> 02:18:08.866]  And I think that's an absolute great plan.
[02:18:08.906 --> 02:18:15.910]  I think we need to start kind of making sure that we're all still pushing back collectively because that's where our power is.
[02:18:16.929 --> 02:18:17.670]  I'll say this, though.
[02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:18.670]  Our big victory is this.
[02:18:19.231 --> 02:18:23.133]  We always had the left creeping around in the dark, and they would never assault us.
[02:18:23.293 --> 02:18:25.555]  I want to say we've had a great victory with Trump and all of us.
[02:18:25.915 --> 02:18:27.176]  We forced them out in the open!
[02:18:27.636 --> 02:18:29.618]  And now the real war is about to happen, folks.
[02:18:29.898 --> 02:18:30.258]  That's true.
[02:18:30.338 --> 02:18:31.199]  We're about to win.
[02:18:31.799 --> 02:18:35.161]  May take five years, may take 20, but let me tell you, they're going down.
[02:18:35.762 --> 02:18:40.645]  We have made them take the field and launch their assault, and that's the end of them.
[02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:41.666]  Stewart, you agree with that statement?
[02:18:41.866 --> 02:18:43.747]  I do, yeah, I think that's correct.
[02:18:44.347 --> 02:18:47.708]  We've forced them to take the mask off and to show what they really are.
[02:18:47.728 --> 02:18:53.130]  Of course, they're still laying out the lies, but it's becoming less and less powerful as time goes on.
[02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:54.770]  So that's what we're going to be doing this base tour.
[02:18:55.331 --> 02:19:04.193]  The main point for me is that I want all the Trump supporters to come together and go support the troops and their right to freedom of association and freedom of thought and stand up for them.
[02:19:04.254 --> 02:19:08.495]  Because if they see us united and supporting them, they're more likely to be strong.
[02:19:08.755 --> 02:19:11.818]  And if we stand up and they stand up, the bad guys lose.
[02:19:12.038 --> 02:19:12.419]  Period.
[02:19:12.719 --> 02:19:17.444]  And it could be a very bloodless, very peaceful victory for us if we stand united.
[02:19:17.624 --> 02:19:23.430]  But if we fragment and go hide, then why would the troops want to stand up and stick their neck out if we're going to hide?
[02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:24.231]  That's right.
[02:19:24.251 --> 02:19:25.552]  The key is don't be hit.
[02:19:26.633 --> 02:19:26.833]  Right.
[02:19:27.073 --> 02:19:28.115]  Be out in the open.
[02:19:29.022 --> 02:19:29.763]  Come out in the streets.
[02:19:30.023 --> 02:19:31.444]  And I just want to add this.
[02:19:31.624 --> 02:19:39.349]  While I was working on the campaign stuff, I met a lot of the people from the intelligence community and the military intelligence aspects of it.
[02:19:39.449 --> 02:19:43.592]  And they will tell me everything they use is AI based.
[02:19:43.952 --> 02:19:46.334]  So everything is predictive programming for them.
[02:19:46.394 --> 02:19:51.597]  So they gauge all of us based off of what a computer will tell them we're going to do.
[02:19:51.958 --> 02:19:55.700]  So what they would always tell me is we've just got to make sure we stay out of their matrix.
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.421]  We've got to make sure that we're doing this.
[02:19:57.702 --> 02:19:58.042]  Random.
[02:19:58.442 --> 02:20:01.785]  Exactly, because their models cannot anticipate that.
[02:20:01.805 --> 02:20:04.488]  And that's why they're so scared of individual leaders.
[02:20:04.688 --> 02:20:04.868]  Correct.
[02:20:04.928 --> 02:20:05.328]  Exactly.
[02:20:05.348 --> 02:20:08.231]  People act like military intelligence is this high mountain.
[02:20:08.511 --> 02:20:09.492]  They're good people on average.
[02:20:09.772 --> 02:20:13.696]  They're following a globalist template to make the military think this is the outcome.
[02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:18.491]  Right, so make sure you, like she's saying, you don't want to be too predictable.
[02:20:19.231 --> 02:20:22.272]  That's the wonderful thing about us human beings, is we're very unpredictable.
[02:20:22.772 --> 02:20:29.115]  And so they can make all the plans, and they have all the AI they want, and analyzing what we're supposed to be doing, but jump outside the box.
[02:20:29.335 --> 02:20:30.475]  We're the apex predator.
[02:20:30.515 --> 02:20:31.515]  We're the leader.
[02:20:33.196 --> 02:20:33.976]  So be unpredictable.
[02:20:34.937 --> 02:20:35.717]  Step outside the box.
[02:20:37.091 --> 02:20:39.755]  Chris, Chris Sky is about to take over fighting the lockdown.
[02:20:39.795 --> 02:20:42.559]  Let's remember, in America, they know we won't put up with it.
[02:20:42.919 --> 02:20:44.602]  In Europe, they're in a year of lockdown.
[02:20:44.622 --> 02:20:46.464]  In Australia, they're in a year of lockdown.
[02:20:46.564 --> 02:20:47.886]  Permanent, post-human.
[02:20:47.986 --> 02:20:52.292]  AP had an article saying, we need to open our houses forever and never leave our house again.
[02:20:52.573 --> 02:20:53.534]  This is sick evil.
[02:20:54.275 --> 02:20:56.558]  Well, but you're seeing resistance now in England, aren't you?
[02:20:56.718 --> 02:20:57.318]  And in Europe.
[02:20:57.799 --> 02:20:59.961]  You're starting to see overseas more resistance.
[02:21:00.101 --> 02:21:01.142]  Millions protesting.
[02:21:01.383 --> 02:21:01.623]  Right.
[02:21:01.663 --> 02:21:08.470]  So that's, I think the, it's a worldwide, we're part of a worldwide war of the, of the oligarchs versus humanity.
[02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:09.832]  Need to keep that in mind.
[02:21:09.892 --> 02:21:11.653]  God, they're telling us to be prisoners.
[02:21:11.734 --> 02:21:12.715]  It's so obvious.
[02:21:13.395 --> 02:21:13.636]  What's that?
[02:21:14.923 --> 02:21:16.083]  They're saying be prisoners!
[02:21:16.584 --> 02:21:17.464]  Never leave your house!
[02:21:17.504 --> 02:21:20.045]  That's... Like, AP said, like, never leave your house.
[02:21:20.085 --> 02:21:20.625]  It's beautiful.
[02:21:21.186 --> 02:21:23.066]  It was like the most dystopic article ever.
[02:21:23.367 --> 02:21:24.507]  They're literally saying this.
[02:21:25.207 --> 02:21:28.469]  But that's why you see... But most people are starting to realize it's nonsense.
[02:21:28.489 --> 02:21:32.230]  That's why you're seeing... It's like, you'll never go to a bar or go to a restaurant.
[02:21:32.370 --> 02:21:32.971]  It's good.
[02:21:33.591 --> 02:21:35.211]  Your children will never leave your house.
[02:21:35.292 --> 02:21:35.712]  It's good.
[02:21:35.732 --> 02:21:38.493]  I mean, you like... It sounds like a crazy person wrote this.
[02:21:38.773 --> 02:21:40.794]  But this is AP officially saying this.
[02:21:42.054 --> 02:21:42.234]  So?
[02:21:42.614 --> 02:21:43.314]  No, I agree!
[02:21:43.374 --> 02:21:45.815]  I'm saying it shows how sick they are.
[02:21:46.335 --> 02:21:46.595]  Right.
[02:21:46.615 --> 02:21:47.715]  I mean, God!
[02:21:48.255 --> 02:21:55.037]  You know, it's kind of sad when you see someone driving down the highway, I've seen it here in Texas, drive down the highway with a mask on in their own car by themselves.
[02:21:55.097 --> 02:21:57.417]  It's just like, there's some people that just buy into this stuff.
[02:21:57.537 --> 02:21:58.298]  No, no, I agree.
[02:21:58.778 --> 02:22:00.178]  People ask, why are they doing it?
[02:22:00.198 --> 02:22:02.258]  Because at least a certain percentage is targeted.
[02:22:02.718 --> 02:22:04.239]  A certain percentage will do whatever they're told.
[02:22:04.579 --> 02:22:04.739]  Right.
[02:22:05.379 --> 02:22:06.980]  And that's, you just have to just accept that.
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:10.661]  But a growing majority knows this nonsense.
[02:22:10.681 --> 02:22:16.062]  A growing majority can look and see what's happening when people get the shot and their, like their skin falls off.
[02:22:16.122 --> 02:22:19.083]  And I saw the one thing posted on InfoWars about that guy.
[02:22:19.563 --> 02:22:21.124]  You know, there's certain people will die from it.
[02:22:21.524 --> 02:22:24.105]  And so we have to be ready to say, okay,
[02:22:25.438 --> 02:22:26.759]  COVID-19 was nonsense.
[02:22:26.939 --> 02:22:32.243]  President Trump got played when he was coerced or convinced to do the vaccine.
[02:22:32.764 --> 02:22:34.025]  He needs to realize that also.
[02:22:34.045 --> 02:22:35.566]  That's something that he has to be willing to accept.
[02:22:35.586 --> 02:22:36.026]  He has to come out.
[02:22:36.046 --> 02:22:36.887]  That's his biggest failing.
[02:22:36.947 --> 02:22:37.828]  All right, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:22:38.248 --> 02:22:39.329]  Kelly, thank you so much.
[02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:42.732]  We have Chris Sky taking over on the other side.
[02:22:42.752 --> 02:22:43.252]  The War Room.
[02:22:43.292 --> 02:22:44.773]  Owen Schroeder from The Border.
[02:22:44.793 --> 02:22:47.195]  Please stay with us and magnify this broadcast.
[02:22:47.215 --> 02:22:48.116]  Promote it right now.
[02:22:48.136 --> 02:22:48.536]  Stay with us.
[02:22:49.757 --> 02:22:50.258]  Hello, everybody.
[02:22:51.772 --> 02:22:55.334]  I'm your guest host, Chris Sky, jumping in for a few segments here.
[02:22:55.394 --> 02:22:58.116]  We're going to call my segments, Taking Action.
[02:22:58.416 --> 02:23:01.938]  And real quick, I'm just going to tell everyone where they can find me because everyone's been asking.
[02:23:02.238 --> 02:23:05.079]  So on Instagram, it's at real Chris Sky.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:08.361]  On Telegram, it's at real Chris Sky, but all caps.
[02:23:09.082 --> 02:23:11.883]  On Twitter, you can type in Chris Sky and I'll pop up.
[02:23:12.043 --> 02:23:14.405]  On Facebook, same thing, Chris Sky, and I'll pop up.
[02:23:14.905 --> 02:23:16.766]  So what does taking action mean?
[02:23:17.301 --> 02:23:21.646]  Taking action is the second phase of united non-compliance.
[02:23:21.886 --> 02:23:23.848]  The first phase was the awakening.
[02:23:24.269 --> 02:23:25.490]  The awakening was 2020.
[02:23:26.091 --> 02:23:32.918]  That's when everybody had to overcome their fear and realize this isn't about our safety, this is about control.
[02:23:32.938 --> 02:23:33.699]  Now our
[02:23:34.431 --> 02:23:39.716]  Quarter of the way through 2021 and it took some people some time to catch up, but now we're transitioning.
[02:23:39.936 --> 02:23:40.937]  The world is awake.
[02:23:40.997 --> 02:23:42.058]  You can look around the world.
[02:23:42.098 --> 02:23:46.522]  You see protests of millions and millions of people because everybody knows what's going on now.
[02:23:46.602 --> 02:23:52.588]  Everybody realizes that it's not in their best interest and they need to stand up for themselves or they're going to lose their countries.
[02:23:53.809 --> 02:23:54.990]  So what are we doing?
[02:23:55.331 --> 02:23:57.533]  We have a protest coming up in Vancouver.
[02:23:57.573 --> 02:23:58.694]  Can we play my clip real quick?
[02:24:00.825 --> 02:24:04.527]  The people of Vancouver, a very important message for you.
[02:24:04.967 --> 02:24:07.808]  This Friday, 2pm, City Hall.
[02:24:08.589 --> 02:24:12.330]  Go out and support your small businesses.
[02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:17.753]  They're organizing a rally out of desperation to survive.
[02:24:18.073 --> 02:24:20.394]  They need your help, they need your support.
[02:24:20.934 --> 02:24:22.495]  Friday, 2pm.
[02:24:23.076 --> 02:24:28.821]  All the influencers that are following me in Vancouver, share this video.
[02:24:29.041 --> 02:24:30.062]  It's that simple, people.
[02:24:30.562 --> 02:24:33.064]  United Non-Compliance.
[02:24:35.206 --> 02:24:37.107]  Okay, so why did I make that video?
[02:24:37.247 --> 02:24:40.990]  It's not just for the Vancouver protest, which is very important and everybody needs to get out there.
[02:24:41.391 --> 02:24:43.272]  It's for protests all across Canada.
[02:24:43.312 --> 02:24:49.617]  There's protests happening in Toronto at Queen's Park, there's protests happening in Calgary and Alberta this weekend, and you might see me there.
[02:24:50.198 --> 02:24:50.378]  Maybe.
[02:24:51.227 --> 02:24:52.948]  And there's protests happening all around.
[02:24:53.048 --> 02:24:53.349]  Why?
[02:24:53.549 --> 02:24:59.973]  Because just like I was warning you on previous episodes of the Alex Jones Show and other things, the lockdown is coming in Canada.
[02:25:00.394 --> 02:25:07.058]  In the United States, the only two states I saw that had their restrictions extended were Wisconsin and Georgia.
[02:25:07.318 --> 02:25:10.981]  Every other state either had them paused, removed, or eased.
[02:25:11.451 --> 02:25:13.013]  So they're going in the right way.
[02:25:13.293 --> 02:25:20.022]  In Canada, I think it's possible because we're waking up a little bit quicker over here, maybe because of my efforts, they're going to try to lock us down again.
[02:25:20.042 --> 02:25:21.263]  They've already locked down Vancouver.
[02:25:21.283 --> 02:25:22.465]  They've already locked down Hamilton.
[02:25:22.525 --> 02:25:24.668]  They already said that they're going to lock down Toronto next.
[02:25:25.028 --> 02:25:26.971]  So these protests are more important than ever.
[02:25:27.291 --> 02:25:28.753]  But we need to shift gears, people.
[02:25:29.173 --> 02:25:30.335]  These protests aren't helping.
[02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:34.657]  I'm a speaker at the protests, and I'm going to tell you right now, there's no need to speak anymore.
[02:25:34.897 --> 02:25:36.278]  Everybody knows what's going on.
[02:25:36.578 --> 02:25:37.879]  Now it's time to take action.
[02:25:38.179 --> 02:25:41.301]  I want you guys to switch up the role of these protests.
[02:25:41.641 --> 02:25:45.003]  Now, when you guys are getting together, I want you to make groups.
[02:25:45.463 --> 02:25:46.924]  Group leaders and groups.
[02:25:47.184 --> 02:25:48.185]  What kind of groups do we need?
[02:25:48.598 --> 02:25:51.820]  We need groups of parents that are going to go against the schools for masks.
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:59.423]  We need groups of business owners that are going to unite and open on the same day to overwhelm the Gestapo that's going to try to close you down.
[02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:02.565]  We need groups of people that are going to go shopping mask free.
[02:26:02.845 --> 02:26:11.529]  So when you get into these big groups, when in these big cities and these small cities, and we're having these protests on the weekend, don't waste hours and hours listening to people saying the same things over and over.
[02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:13.130]  Start organizing.
[02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:16.732]  Organizing is the phase, the next phase of action.
[02:26:17.267 --> 02:26:19.729]  And after organization, it's implementation.
[02:26:20.029 --> 02:26:21.731]  So, like I said, let me say it again.
[02:26:21.751 --> 02:26:22.992]  Start making groups.
[02:26:23.372 --> 02:26:25.134]  Groups of parents to fight the masks.
[02:26:25.434 --> 02:26:28.136]  Groups of business owners to organize and open together.
[02:26:28.396 --> 02:26:30.418]  Groups of people that will shop mask-free.
[02:26:30.858 --> 02:26:32.700]  This is how we take our country back.
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:34.401]  This is how we take our freedoms back.
[02:26:34.601 --> 02:26:38.104]  This is how we show united non-compliance.
[02:26:39.572 --> 02:26:42.474]  I'm speaking right now to all the influencers on all social media.
[02:26:42.774 --> 02:26:44.316]  You guys got hundreds of thousands of followers.
[02:26:44.336 --> 02:26:45.516]  You guys got millions of followers.
[02:26:46.057 --> 02:26:47.798]  You're leaders whether you like it or not.
[02:26:48.398 --> 02:26:49.679]  Your voice matters.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:51.801]  You can make a difference.
[02:26:52.141 --> 02:26:55.203]  You should be telling people to go to these rallies.
[02:26:55.223 --> 02:26:57.345]  You should be telling people to support small business.
[02:26:57.785 --> 02:26:59.646]  This is what needs to be done.
[02:27:00.207 --> 02:27:03.729]  If you saw, put it up, we got vaccine passports.
[02:27:03.829 --> 02:27:06.270]  This is the agenda that I said is the endgame, people.
[02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:10.593]  And they want to close your businesses, first of all, to bring in the universal basic income.
[02:27:10.833 --> 02:27:16.016]  So that's why they're doing this next phase of lockdown because they know there's a bunch of businesses on the brink.
[02:27:16.317 --> 02:27:16.857]  I'm going to say it.
[02:27:17.017 --> 02:27:17.577]  I said it before.
[02:27:17.597 --> 02:27:18.378]  I'm going to repeat it once.
[02:27:18.974 --> 02:27:24.539]  July last year in Canada, CFIB said up to 225,000 businesses had already closed.
[02:27:24.859 --> 02:27:30.204]  The updated report from the CFIB in January 2021 showed that we're up to another 200,000 to 300,000 that are going to close this year.
[02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:39.012]  That means universal basic income will slip through much easier because the unemployment rate will be so high it'll be justified.
[02:27:39.252 --> 02:27:44.994]  As you just saw, they showed that New York is the first place to introduce the vaccine passport.
[02:27:45.174 --> 02:27:47.415]  It goes into implementation April 2nd.
[02:27:47.575 --> 02:27:50.476]  This is not a conspiracy theory anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:50.716 --> 02:27:52.037]  This is happening now.
[02:27:52.277 --> 02:27:53.537]  It has already happened in New York.
[02:27:53.957 --> 02:27:55.818]  Thankfully, we got places like
[02:27:56.431 --> 02:28:01.553]  Florida, where Governor DeSantis has made an executive order to make the vaccine passport illegal.
[02:28:01.813 --> 02:28:04.254]  So we already are seeing a divide in the United States.
[02:28:04.514 --> 02:28:07.515]  And I think you're going to see a divide between blue states and red states.
[02:28:07.855 --> 02:28:14.818]  And the red states are going to say no to this vaccine passport, but states like California are going to follow New York's example and try to implement this.
[02:28:15.358 --> 02:28:16.718]  And this is very dangerous.
[02:28:16.998 --> 02:28:24.001]  And another component of this that I want to bring to everybody's attention, and this is very huge, they're trying to implement forced testing.
[02:28:24.798 --> 02:28:25.078]  All right.
[02:28:45.854 --> 02:28:50.256]  Charter of Rights in Canada and these things can not be violated.
[02:28:50.296 --> 02:28:51.256]  They cannot fire you.
[02:28:51.296 --> 02:28:53.297]  They cannot force you to take tests against your will.
[02:28:53.337 --> 02:28:55.338]  They cannot force you to take vaccines against your will.
[02:28:55.618 --> 02:29:01.040]  No matter what the company memo says and you got to organize with other people and you got to fight against this.
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:02.581]  There are lawyers that will help you.
[02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:09.123]  If you do not do this, the vaccine passport will creep in on all these states and it's going to creep in in Canada.
[02:29:09.423 --> 02:29:13.725]  And if you get a vaccine passport and you get UBI, you're not going to like the countries you're living in.
[02:29:14.522 --> 02:29:16.203]  So people, I hope you've been taking notes.
[02:29:16.383 --> 02:29:21.807]  I hope you understand that when you go to these protests, I'm going to say it again because Canadians need to hear things a lot of times.
[02:29:21.867 --> 02:29:23.588]  I hope Americans don't have to hear them as many.
[02:29:24.429 --> 02:29:26.350]  Stop speaking for hours and hours.
[02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:28.952]  Stop marching through the streets aimlessly.
[02:29:29.433 --> 02:29:31.494]  Start organizing your people in groups.
[02:29:31.834 --> 02:29:36.878]  The business owners, the concerned parents, the people who need to do the mass free shopping.
[02:29:37.038 --> 02:29:44.163]  These are the three methods of attack that will open up our countries, retain our freedoms, and stop their agenda in their tracks.
[02:29:45.319 --> 02:29:48.944]  We got about a minute left in this segment, so I just want to let that sink into everybody.
[02:29:51.407 --> 02:29:55.532]  People, like, the time for, like, waking people up is gone.
[02:29:55.752 --> 02:29:57.054]  The time for action is now.
[02:29:57.134 --> 02:29:59.317]  If we don't act now, and I mean now,
[02:29:59.807 --> 02:30:01.108]  We're not talking months from now.
[02:30:01.128 --> 02:30:02.449]  We're talking within weeks.
[02:30:02.729 --> 02:30:05.231]  The vaccine passport is going to be in dozens of states.
[02:30:05.271 --> 02:30:07.832]  The vaccine passport is going to be implemented in Canada.
[02:30:08.153 --> 02:30:10.614]  And we're going to see hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.
[02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:12.796]  We're going to see millions of people on the streets.
[02:30:13.076 --> 02:30:16.538]  And our government is going to throw up their hands and say, oh, we had nothing to do with it.
[02:30:16.838 --> 02:30:21.642]  The next segment, I'm going to talk more about the vaccine, especially how the vaccine has been unfolding in Canada.
[02:30:21.682 --> 02:30:25.164]  The AstraZeneca vaccine is an absolute disaster for them.
[02:30:25.584 --> 02:30:27.805]  But they're still trying to force it on the Canadian public.
[02:30:28.105 --> 02:30:31.546]  It's absolutely incredible and we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[02:30:32.007 --> 02:30:34.968]  Right now we got about 30 seconds left so I don't want to over talk.
[02:30:35.048 --> 02:30:40.670]  We got messages from our sponsors and we got commercials so we're going to get ready to go to these commercials.
[02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:44.512]  As you see AstraZeneca halted the rollout for under 55s.
[02:30:44.532 --> 02:30:47.574]  We're going to talk about that in the next segment because it's even worse than that.
[02:30:47.594 --> 02:30:48.975]  It's a lot worse than it even looks.
[02:30:49.516 --> 02:30:52.498]  And everybody needs to understand this is the next phase of action.
[02:30:52.678 --> 02:30:54.099]  Rejecting this vaccine.
[02:30:54.519 --> 02:30:56.260]  And we're going to tell you exactly how to do that.
[02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:02.784]  We're going to tell you how to wake other people up to this fact as well because there's way too much compliance and we need a lot less compliance.
[02:31:02.844 --> 02:31:05.006]  We need united non-compliance.
[02:31:05.506 --> 02:31:06.487]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[02:31:07.455 --> 02:31:08.055]  Hello, everybody.
[02:31:08.576 --> 02:31:10.337]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:10.957 --> 02:31:12.758]  I'm your guest host today, Chris Sky.
[02:31:12.778 --> 02:31:20.962]  You can find me on Instagram at RealChrisSky, on Telegram at RealChrisSky, all caps, on Facebook, Chris Sky, and on Twitter, Chris Sky.
[02:31:21.703 --> 02:31:23.944]  Anyway, we're going to do this segment
[02:31:24.504 --> 02:31:29.267]  All to the vaccine, because the vaccine is the most important pressing issue of the time.
[02:31:29.567 --> 02:31:31.208]  So I want to bring back what we brought up before.
[02:31:31.228 --> 02:31:43.794]  I want to bring up before that, before they banned the AstraZeneca vaccine for under 55s in Canada, our health watchdog actually did not recommend it for 65 and over.
[02:31:43.834 --> 02:31:45.855]  So I think you guys have that, you can put it on.
[02:31:47.175 --> 02:31:48.836]  That's after it went into use.
[02:31:48.936 --> 02:31:51.337]  After it went into use, they banned it for under 55s.
[02:31:51.577 --> 02:32:00.262]  Before it officially went into use, our health watchdogs told the Canadian government this is not safe for 65s and over, and they recommended our government do not use it.
[02:32:00.682 --> 02:32:01.742]  I believe you have that as well.
[02:32:02.283 --> 02:32:02.923]  And there you go.
[02:32:03.463 --> 02:32:05.604]  Not recommended for people 65 and older.
[02:32:05.944 --> 02:32:08.505]  This is the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.
[02:32:08.565 --> 02:32:10.525]  This is Canada's vaccine watchdog.
[02:32:10.565 --> 02:32:15.567]  These are the vaccine experts that advise our doctors on what we should do.
[02:32:15.787 --> 02:32:18.428]  And they told our doctors, don't give this to people 65 and over.
[02:32:18.728 --> 02:32:20.809]  Our government said, ah, we'll do it anyway.
[02:32:21.329 --> 02:32:29.040]  Then they started using it, and a few weeks after implementation, even though dozens of other countries around the world have banned this vaccine, guess what?
[02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:33.165]  Now they're saying it's not safe and they banned it for under 55s.
[02:32:33.446 --> 02:32:35.048]  So I guess it's only safe for people, what, 56 to 64?
[02:32:37.262 --> 02:32:38.843]  Or maybe it's just not safe for anybody.
[02:32:39.303 --> 02:32:39.844]  Think, people.
[02:32:40.164 --> 02:32:41.705]  This is what we need to do with the vaccine.
[02:32:41.825 --> 02:32:43.906]  We need to get people asking questions.
[02:32:44.266 --> 02:32:48.949]  That's why we started the hashtag Just Say No campaign.
[02:32:48.969 --> 02:32:50.670]  And once again, influencers.
[02:32:50.890 --> 02:32:53.472]  I don't care if you're an actor, model, singer.
[02:32:53.792 --> 02:32:58.175]  If you have followers, if you have influence, you should be posting this.
[02:32:58.675 --> 02:33:00.936]  Why do you want a vaccine passport?
[02:33:00.976 --> 02:33:05.179]  Why do you want to force everybody to be vaccinated as a pretense to live their life?
[02:33:05.894 --> 02:33:07.454]  It makes no sense.
[02:33:07.634 --> 02:33:13.335]  Even if you think you're gonna lose some work because of this, does it make sense to give up the rest of your life for a job?
[02:33:13.976 --> 02:33:15.696]  And the lives of your children?
[02:33:16.116 --> 02:33:16.316]  No!
[02:33:16.596 --> 02:33:21.537]  So, everybody should be making a hashtag justsaynopost on their Instagram.
[02:33:21.857 --> 02:33:23.037]  This vaccine is no joke.
[02:33:23.337 --> 02:33:25.258]  We've seen people like Hank Aaron die.
[02:33:25.298 --> 02:33:27.318]  We've seen people like Marvin Hagler die.
[02:33:27.538 --> 02:33:30.019]  We've seen a 39-year-old mom in Utah die.
[02:33:30.619 --> 02:33:32.139]  Every single day,
[02:33:32.899 --> 02:33:43.402]  I get messages from people around Canada and the United States who tell me one of their family members was maimed or killed by these vaccines or within days of the vaccine.
[02:33:43.442 --> 02:33:45.723]  Sorry, I'm not allowed to say by the vaccine.
[02:33:45.923 --> 02:33:47.963]  That would be that would be that would be censored.
[02:33:48.203 --> 02:33:53.725]  So we'll say within a few days of taking this, usually the first dose of a vaccine, these people are
[02:33:54.292 --> 02:33:55.953]  Seriously injured or killed.
[02:33:56.313 --> 02:33:57.094]  Let that sink in.
[02:33:57.534 --> 02:33:58.835]  And that's just one dose.
[02:33:59.155 --> 02:34:03.138]  And they want to dose you multiple times a year, every year, for the rest of your life.
[02:34:03.918 --> 02:34:04.959]  You think you're going to be okay?
[02:34:04.979 --> 02:34:08.681]  Or you think you're a ticking time bomb for a serious adverse reaction or death?
[02:34:09.542 --> 02:34:10.643]  Let's be clear, people.
[02:34:10.963 --> 02:34:16.947]  When a normal vaccine is developed, it takes about four to five years before they even start testing it on humans.
[02:34:17.427 --> 02:34:22.070]  And then it takes about 10 years before they're ready to inoculate mass members of the public.
[02:34:22.697 --> 02:34:26.140]  We have the AstraZeneca vaccine, and I can actually call it a vaccine.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:31.484]  And then we have, and it's probably, it's the one that has the most prevalent side effects of all.
[02:34:31.805 --> 02:34:34.427]  It's been banned by a majority of the developed world.
[02:34:36.369 --> 02:34:38.430]  And people are still like ready to line up for it.
[02:34:38.711 --> 02:34:39.571]  It's mind boggling.
[02:34:39.831 --> 02:34:43.414]  But then we have Moderna, who's never made a vaccine in their life.
[02:34:43.775 --> 02:34:44.996]  They have an mRNA
[02:34:46.171 --> 02:35:07.419]  Gene therapy technology which they officially call an operating system that was originally designed to treat cancerous tumors and they somehow modified this technology to come out with their first product ever for humans that they've ever created and will ever distribute which is an experimental mRNA operating system which they're calling a vaccine.
[02:35:07.719 --> 02:35:09.220]  And why are they calling it a vaccine?
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:21.724]  Because if they called it what it really is, a treatment, there's other treatments available like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, rest and relaxation, etc.
[02:35:22.064 --> 02:35:24.404]  And then they wouldn't be able to force it upon you.
[02:35:24.724 --> 02:35:29.886]  But by calling it a vaccine when it doesn't even meet the definition of a vaccine, which the definition of a vaccine is,
[02:35:30.433 --> 02:35:37.596]  It needs to immunize you, make you immune from the disease, and it has to protect you from giving that disease to others.
[02:35:37.916 --> 02:35:48.460]  They've already admitted it does not immunize you from COVID, it is just meant to lower the rate of your symptoms, and they already admitted that you're still contagious to others.
[02:35:49.475 --> 02:35:50.456]  Uh, so you have to wear a mask.
[02:35:50.897 --> 02:35:59.688]  And if you have any doubt of this, you could just look up people, you can look up in mainstream media, there's multiple examples of people who received both doses of their vaccine and still tested positive for COVID.
[02:36:00.128 --> 02:36:01.750]  And that's why they tell you, you still gotta wear a mask.
[02:36:02.011 --> 02:36:07.758]  So why would you take something that doesn't immunize you and can make you contagious to your family when you weren't contagious the day before you took it?
[02:36:08.977 --> 02:36:10.598]  And that's why they're calling it a vaccine.
[02:36:10.899 --> 02:36:22.130]  Because when it's called a vaccine, when they create this emergency situation, they can pass a vaccine through for human consumption within a year like they did when it's supposed to take 10 years.
[02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:23.071]  And guess what?
[02:36:23.391 --> 02:36:28.276]  The only reason that that's legal is because we're in this so-called state of emergency.
[02:36:28.636 --> 02:36:31.179]  So if you think that they have any, any
[02:36:33.579 --> 02:36:35.381]  You're crazy!
[02:36:35.401 --> 02:36:39.683]  Because if they remove the state of emergency, the vaccine no longer has approval.
[02:36:39.703 --> 02:36:46.228]  Because it doesn't have FDA approval, it hasn't fully passed clinical trials, it's only approved by emergency declaration.
[02:36:46.508 --> 02:36:50.571]  EUL in the United States, emergency, oh sorry, EUA in the United States.
[02:36:50.771 --> 02:36:50.991]  I think?
[02:37:10.373 --> 02:37:12.594]  And I want someone to fact check me on this.
[02:37:12.874 --> 02:37:19.757]  I bet it has more reported adverse reactions in the short amount of time that it's been used than virtually any other vaccine in recent history.
[02:37:20.138 --> 02:37:21.478]  And that's because it's been rushed through.
[02:37:21.498 --> 02:37:23.579]  That's because it's using untested technology.
[02:37:23.819 --> 02:37:28.421]  And for the doctors that are so-called recommending this to their patients, I have questions for you.
[02:37:28.662 --> 02:37:31.583]  And I want you to be able to answer this to all your patients.
[02:37:32.023 --> 02:37:36.145]  Number one, how can you recommend something that hasn't been FDA approved?
[02:37:36.565 --> 02:37:40.047]  How can you recommend something that hasn't passed clinical trials?
[02:37:40.527 --> 02:37:46.051]  How can you recommend something that hasn't had any short or long-term safety or efficacy data?
[02:37:46.531 --> 02:37:53.396]  How can you recommend something that they admit will not immunize your patient from the disease it's supposed to protect them from?
[02:37:54.216 --> 02:38:02.122]  How can you recommend something that you admit makes your patient now contagious with this so-called disease after they get this inoculation?
[02:38:02.582 --> 02:38:08.886]  It makes absolutely no sense and your Hippocratic Oath is to do no harm and right away you know you're doing harm.
[02:38:10.501 --> 02:38:17.085]  Everybody, once again, hashtag just say no to the COVID vaccine.
[02:38:17.525 --> 02:38:29.752]  If we can stop, if we can get even only 50% compliance and that's a lot of people for them to inoculate when they've only done about 10% of the population on average in most places.
[02:38:30.492 --> 02:38:35.475]  We can stop the vaccine passport in its tracks and we can save a lot of people from a lot of
[02:38:36.367 --> 02:38:40.809]  A lot of disease and hardship, because the vaccine is no joke.
[02:38:41.129 --> 02:38:43.230]  These mRNA injections are no joke.
[02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:47.771]  Pfizer, Moderna, they should be up for crimes against humanity.
[02:38:48.072 --> 02:38:57.695]  And the next phase of this, after we reject this vaccine, after we stop this vaccine passport and the rest of their agenda, is we need to start holding people accountable.
[02:38:57.935 --> 02:39:02.417]  There's already lawsuits all over the world against this, and that's just step one.
[02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:06.792]  Step two is going to be removing people from power that allowed this to happen.
[02:39:07.432 --> 02:39:09.313]  And those people are going to be held accountable.
[02:39:09.613 --> 02:39:14.715]  So everybody that's in power right now, I hope you're watching this and I know a lot of you will be because this is going to get a lot of views.
[02:39:15.196 --> 02:39:16.896]  A lot of people are waking up to your scam.
[02:39:18.137 --> 02:39:21.738]  You're on the wrong side of history and it ends only one way.
[02:39:22.519 --> 02:39:25.980]  And it ends with the truth always rising to the top.
[02:39:26.681 --> 02:39:31.683]  People always understanding what's best for themselves and ultimately doing that to protect them and their families.
[02:39:32.435 --> 02:39:37.600]  These experimental so-called vaccines are a complete crime against humanity.
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:42.445]  One of the biggest crimes against humanity in not just recent history, in history period.
[02:39:42.825 --> 02:39:51.233]  This whole plandemic, and that's exactly what it is, because if I can tell you what's going to happen months before it happens, it's not because every single time.
[02:39:51.353 --> 02:39:52.635]  It's not because I'm a psychic.
[02:39:53.607 --> 02:39:58.015]  It's because I know what they're gonna do because they have it planned well in advance.
[02:39:58.276 --> 02:39:59.078]  Remember that people.
[02:39:59.498 --> 02:40:02.244]  Everything that's happening right now was not accidental.
[02:40:02.604 --> 02:40:04.288]  All the increments leading you up to this
[02:40:04.639 --> 02:40:15.486]  We're planning in advance and spoon fed to you in a way it's called predictive programming to make you comply without resistance to your own servitude and your own destitute for the rest of your life.
[02:40:15.907 --> 02:40:21.611]  And now we're going to be coming back to the Alex Jones Show in a few seconds because we got to have more messages from our sponsors.
[02:40:22.011 --> 02:40:22.691]  I'm Chris Skyes.
[02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:31.557]  Stay with me because on the last segment, we're going to go over again action with the protests and we're going to talk about law enforcement and how integral they are to the community.
[02:40:32.478 --> 02:40:33.879]  And we're going to go with that.
[02:40:34.588 --> 02:40:37.929]  Hey, everybody, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:38.350 --> 02:40:46.233]  I'm your guest host, Chris Sky, at Real Chris Sky on Instagram, at Real Chris Sky on Telegram, all caps, Chris Sky on Twitter, Chris Sky on Facebook.
[02:40:46.873 --> 02:40:48.354]  So this is our last segment together.
[02:40:48.394 --> 02:40:53.956]  We covered protests and how we need to reorganize and actually put into action our protests.
[02:40:54.196 --> 02:40:59.338]  We covered the vaccines and the vaccine passports and how to ask questions and ultimately how to just say no.
[02:40:59.818 --> 02:41:04.380]  And now we're going to talk about law enforcement for a bit, because law enforcement
[02:41:04.924 --> 02:41:16.230]  Is probably the most integral part of the community in this regard, because this is basically has been a psychological war and now it is turning into a physical war.
[02:41:16.270 --> 02:41:21.152]  When somebody is going to take something and put it into your body, it is no longer a psychological war.
[02:41:21.172 --> 02:41:22.233]  It's now a physical war.
[02:41:22.773 --> 02:41:25.655]  And these people are the shepherds of society.
[02:41:25.695 --> 02:41:27.115]  These are the warriors of society.
[02:41:27.155 --> 02:41:32.158]  The majority of them signed up to that job because they wanted to protect
[02:41:32.674 --> 02:41:35.114]  Themselves, their families, their communities.
[02:41:35.594 --> 02:41:36.735]  And that's the truth.
[02:41:37.295 --> 02:41:38.675]  Yes, they're bad apples.
[02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:41.135]  Yes, some police are following blind orders.
[02:41:41.415 --> 02:41:43.216]  And yes, we have to hold those people accountable.
[02:41:43.496 --> 02:41:46.356]  But ultimately, everybody, we cannot be divided.
[02:41:46.396 --> 02:41:48.397]  We need to back the blue.
[02:41:48.417 --> 02:41:49.737]  I love police.
[02:41:49.877 --> 02:41:54.198]  They've done some bad things to me, obviously, but so it's not a big deal.
[02:41:54.998 --> 02:41:59.579]  To me, that's water under the bridge, because in the grand scheme of things, we need our police.
[02:41:59.819 --> 02:42:00.599]  They need us.
[02:42:00.859 --> 02:42:02.019]  But they need to understand.
[02:42:02.386 --> 02:42:05.248]  That their oath is to the people that they swore to protect.
[02:42:05.288 --> 02:42:07.990]  Their oath in the United States is to uphold the Constitution.
[02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:10.893]  Their oath in Canada is to uphold our Charter of Rights.
[02:42:11.273 --> 02:42:23.723]  And if you are given an order that is immoral, unethical, and a violation of your oath, it is not just... It's your duty, your sworn duty, to disobey that order.
[02:42:24.283 --> 02:42:26.525]  And eventually, it's your duty to hold those accountable.
[02:42:26.905 --> 02:42:31.669]  Mr. Scott McKay, the street patriot, said it very well.
[02:42:32.176 --> 02:42:42.529]  This only ends two ways for the law enforcement that decides to side with the darkness, decides with the government, that decides with the people who are trying to take our freedoms.
[02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:46.694]  As soon as your worth is used up,
[02:42:47.694 --> 02:42:50.496]  Well, who do you think is getting those defund the police programs going?
[02:42:50.616 --> 02:42:51.537]  This is the government.
[02:42:51.877 --> 02:42:53.558]  This is the intelligence apparatus.
[02:42:53.658 --> 02:42:53.959]  Why?
[02:42:53.979 --> 02:42:59.143]  Because they know that you guys are the ones with the knowledge, the weapons, the training to fight back.
[02:42:59.543 --> 02:43:03.145]  So they're using you right now to help implement their control grid.
[02:43:03.506 --> 02:43:05.147]  And then once they have it,
[02:43:05.862 --> 02:43:07.143]  They're going to get rid of you.
[02:43:07.623 --> 02:43:10.724]  So this ends only one way for you, the right way.
[02:43:11.065 --> 02:43:15.107]  If you side with the bad guys, you're going to lose because we're going to win.
[02:43:15.407 --> 02:43:17.408]  And then you're going to be held accountable with them.
[02:43:17.788 --> 02:43:20.609]  And nobody's ever going to forget it for generations.
[02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:25.592]  And if they did win, which will never happen, they're going to get rid of you anyway.
[02:43:25.712 --> 02:43:28.333]  So it's a lose, lose situation for you.
[02:43:28.893 --> 02:43:32.195]  So the only thing for you to do is the right thing.
[02:43:32.523 --> 02:43:38.848]  The honorable thing is to honor truth and justice and uphold your oath to your communities.
[02:43:39.188 --> 02:43:43.571]  Cause it's going to get to the point where the orders are going to get more and more unethical.
[02:43:43.811 --> 02:43:44.832]  We saw what happened to me.
[02:43:44.912 --> 02:43:47.914]  I don't, uh, most people saw it, but I'll just talk about it really quick.
[02:43:48.455 --> 02:44:00.804]  I had almost 40 police officers and 20 cruisers blocking off entire area around my house and come on my property with no warrant and no arrest warrant and basically trespass and try to kidnap me in the middle of the night.
[02:44:00.824 --> 02:44:00.864]  Uh,
[02:44:02.759 --> 02:44:04.280]  Literally something out of a movie.
[02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:07.221]  And this is just the beginning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:07.301 --> 02:44:09.622]  That's not like an isolated incident.
[02:44:09.742 --> 02:44:11.903]  It's just an isolated incident at this point.
[02:44:12.264 --> 02:44:15.105]  This is going to get worse if we don't stop it now.
[02:44:15.612 --> 02:44:23.996]  And that's why we have these wonderful organizations in Canada, like Stand on Guard for Thee, and this needs to go not just national in Canada, but it needs to go into the United States as well.
[02:44:24.256 --> 02:44:25.016]  You guys have sheriffs.
[02:44:25.036 --> 02:44:26.717]  Your sheriffs need to stand up for your people.
[02:44:26.757 --> 02:44:27.797]  You guys need to organize.
[02:44:28.258 --> 02:44:29.918]  And back to the organization.
[02:44:29.958 --> 02:44:31.199]  I'd like to make a very good point.
[02:44:31.559 --> 02:44:34.581]  And the biggest weapon we have is not just our voice.
[02:44:34.641 --> 02:44:35.741]  It's not just social media.
[02:44:36.021 --> 02:44:40.803]  It's the thing that made the difference for me in that night when I had the police illegally come to my house.
[02:44:41.324 --> 02:44:41.904]  You know what it was?
[02:44:42.224 --> 02:44:43.044]  As you see it right here?
[02:44:43.465 --> 02:44:44.405]  It was my camera.
[02:44:44.853 --> 02:44:50.715]  It was my ability to document and provide witnesses to this injustice.
[02:44:51.255 --> 02:44:52.696]  And that is your best weapon.
[02:44:53.016 --> 02:44:53.876]  Your cell phone.
[02:44:53.956 --> 02:44:56.937]  You can go live if even three other people are watching.
[02:44:57.117 --> 02:44:58.318]  That's way more than enough.
[02:44:58.578 --> 02:45:02.379]  And believe me, if something like that happens, there's gonna be way more than three people watching.
[02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:06.541]  And that's what you need to do when I said organize at the protests.
[02:45:06.721 --> 02:45:07.881]  Organize and implement.
[02:45:08.081 --> 02:45:13.343]  So organize is, instead of speaking and marching and wasting away the day, we know what's going on now.
[02:45:13.883 --> 02:45:15.226]  Get your group leaders together.
[02:45:15.507 --> 02:45:16.809]  Organize the business owners.
[02:45:17.130 --> 02:45:22.300]  Implement an action where once you get 100 or 150 of you guys together, you open on the same day.
[02:45:22.942 --> 02:45:24.946]  Make sure you're always recording interactions.
[02:45:25.563 --> 02:45:26.143]  That's the key.
[02:45:26.543 --> 02:45:33.465]  When you have these people, when you make your mass free shopping groups of 20, 30, 40 people, whatever it is, make sure you print out the bylaw.
[02:45:33.625 --> 02:45:40.227]  Make sure you call bylaw and tell them you want them to go to the store where you're going to go because if the cops get called, they know the bylaw.
[02:45:40.247 --> 02:45:44.288]  They can enforce bylaws legally, but they're not bylaw experts, especially these bylaws.
[02:45:44.508 --> 02:45:49.089]  So you want the bylaw officers there because they will be on your side and they will side with you.
[02:45:49.489 --> 02:45:55.536]  And you can go store to store to store to store and just open them up for everybody like they should be free.
[02:45:56.017 --> 02:45:57.659]  So this is how we implement the action.
[02:45:58.168 --> 02:46:01.750]  You have to record everything, document everything.
[02:46:02.010 --> 02:46:05.652]  There's people coming across the borders now in droves.
[02:46:05.932 --> 02:46:08.854]  People at Pearson, they said they ran out of tickets at Pearson Airport.
[02:46:09.194 --> 02:46:19.880]  At Alberta Airport, Calgary Airport, they're telling people they have a choice now whether they want to go to the quarantine hotels and they're not even wasting their time handing out tickets because the gig is up.
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:23.442]  So people, when you stand up and you implement actions,
[02:46:23.982 --> 02:46:24.943]  These actions work.
[02:46:25.003 --> 02:46:25.924]  And that's where we're at now.
[02:46:26.084 --> 02:46:29.066]  Like I said, 2020 was the awakening.
[02:46:29.086 --> 02:46:33.910]  2021 we're making, we have made the transition from awake to now action.
[02:46:34.410 --> 02:46:36.912]  And that's organization and implementation.
[02:46:37.173 --> 02:46:39.274]  So that's what we got to be doing at these protests.
[02:46:39.494 --> 02:46:42.016]  These protests will grow naturally this way.
[02:46:42.377 --> 02:46:51.424]  The number one thing I want everybody to do at the protests with regards to everything else is every single person there
[02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:55.332]  Needs to bring another person the next time they come.
[02:46:55.852 --> 02:47:06.999]  So if you're a business owner and there's only 20 business owners at that protest, all 20 of you need to talk to as many business owners as you need to, to make sure you can bring one more with you the next time.
[02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:10.502]  And if everybody does that, that's a very small part.
[02:47:11.102 --> 02:47:20.568]  This little tiny action, this little tiny smidgen of united noncompliance will ignite a firestorm across the nation.
[02:47:21.024 --> 02:47:29.432]  And we will open up like you see in Florida, like you see in Texas, like you're seeing anywhere where people value freedom and are ready to stand up for themselves.
[02:47:29.973 --> 02:47:35.298]  And we're getting to the point in Canada where we're not going to be able to stand up for ourselves really soon.
[02:47:35.738 --> 02:47:37.280]  We're not talking months or years.
[02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:38.841]  We're talking like weeks, guys.
[02:47:39.982 --> 02:47:42.225]  Business owners are on the brink.
[02:47:42.725 --> 02:47:44.627]  Vaccine passports are coming.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:51.924]  The Universal Basic Income Scheme is being talked about, is trying to be pushed through Parliament.
[02:47:52.584 --> 02:47:54.645]  This is not a joke.
[02:47:54.665 --> 02:47:56.766]  These are country changing things.
[02:47:56.786 --> 02:47:58.387]  These are not just changing your country.
[02:47:58.667 --> 02:48:00.468]  This is changing the way of life.
[02:48:00.748 --> 02:48:04.130]  This is changing the power structure for generations.
[02:48:05.010 --> 02:48:06.611]  And we can't let it happen.
[02:48:06.651 --> 02:48:07.892]  We can't lose our countries.
[02:48:08.462 --> 02:48:09.903]  We have to stop it here.
[02:48:10.283 --> 02:48:12.444]  So we need to do all the actions we talked about.
[02:48:12.484 --> 02:48:16.247]  We need to, first of all, we need to back the police, but we need to hold them accountable.
[02:48:16.467 --> 02:48:18.328]  So what, how am I going to hold those guys accountable?
[02:48:18.368 --> 02:48:20.109]  And I want, this is what I want.
[02:48:20.129 --> 02:48:21.690]  I want to get more community involvement.
[02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:30.615]  So I'm planning on filing a SIU, which is a special investigations unit investigation, as well as a professional standards investigation.
[02:48:30.975 --> 02:48:34.357]  I'm going to be making a separate video about that and posting it on my Telegram.
[02:48:34.818 --> 02:48:46.242]  And my Instagram and Twitter so people can get actual contact info for these places so we can keep it in the public eye and we can make sure we get justice and accountability and they don't sweep it under the rug.
[02:48:46.662 --> 02:48:48.143]  So this is the kind of thing we need to do.
[02:48:48.183 --> 02:48:54.925]  We need to get the community involved because when the community gets involved and people that really was wake people up and that's what really gets results.
[02:48:55.225 --> 02:48:57.106]  Because they can't ignore a community.
[02:48:57.146 --> 02:48:58.206]  They can ignore one person.
[02:48:58.226 --> 02:49:00.067]  They can even ignore me with my big mouth.
[02:49:00.327 --> 02:49:01.988]  But they can't ignore thousands of us.
[02:49:02.308 --> 02:49:02.968]  They just can't.
[02:49:03.388 --> 02:49:08.871]  Even when a few dozen people showed up to my house when all those police were there, the police turned tail and ran.
[02:49:09.451 --> 02:49:10.451]  It's that simple, people.
[02:49:10.891 --> 02:49:14.773]  Together, we outnumber them by the billions.
[02:49:15.293 --> 02:49:15.973]  The billions.
[02:49:16.734 --> 02:49:18.935]  Everything that they're doing to us is illegal.
[02:49:19.455 --> 02:49:22.436]  Everything that they're doing to you is against your own best interests.
[02:49:22.836 --> 02:49:23.636]  You are adults.
[02:49:23.877 --> 02:49:24.937]  You are free people.
[02:49:25.342 --> 02:49:27.444]  It is up to you to make your own decisions.
[02:49:27.544 --> 02:49:30.706]  It's up to you to make decisions that are the best for you and your family.
[02:49:31.067 --> 02:49:34.910]  And most importantly, it's up to you to act now.
[02:49:35.690 --> 02:49:42.056]  Make, I want everybody when they're done this, when this video is done, first of all, don't go anywhere because War Room will be coming up.
[02:49:42.396 --> 02:49:47.020]  But after War Room, I want you guys to make your hashtag just say no post.
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:48.040]  That's the first step.
[02:49:48.341 --> 02:49:50.963]  That's like a passive, a passive resistance.
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:54.021]  Then I want you to go to your local protests and do what I said.
[02:49:54.061 --> 02:49:55.761]  If you're a business owner, join the business group.
[02:49:56.121 --> 02:49:58.061]  If you want to do the mass reshopping, go there.
[02:49:59.322 --> 02:50:00.082]  That's what we need.
[02:50:00.342 --> 02:50:02.642]  We need people to get up off their couch.
[02:50:03.483 --> 02:50:07.323]  We need people to look themselves in the mirror and understand this is not going away.
[02:50:07.343 --> 02:50:11.404]  They will not relinquish this emergency order for years to come.
[02:50:11.604 --> 02:50:13.065]  You will be wearing masks for years.
[02:50:13.305 --> 02:50:14.325]  You will be vaccinated.
[02:50:14.801 --> 02:50:16.482]  Multiple times for the rest of your life.
[02:50:16.822 --> 02:50:18.143]  You will have travel restrictions.
[02:50:18.403 --> 02:50:20.224]  You will not be able to visit your family and friends.
[02:50:20.584 --> 02:50:22.865]  Every one of your holidays is going to be canceled.
[02:50:23.305 --> 02:50:24.806]  Is this the world you want to live in?
[02:50:24.986 --> 02:50:27.547]  This is the reality that's coming now.
[02:50:28.308 --> 02:50:30.008]  Unless we do something to stop it.
[02:50:30.329 --> 02:50:32.690]  That's why we need to take action.
[02:50:33.090 --> 02:50:34.210]  We need to just say no.
[02:50:34.731 --> 02:50:37.372]  We need to organize and we need to implement.
[02:50:38.052 --> 02:50:41.614]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed this segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:41.794 --> 02:50:43.395]  I was your guest host, Chris Sky.
[02:50:43.885 --> 02:50:48.368]  You can find me on Instagram at RealChrisSky, on Telegram at RealChrisSky, all caps.
[02:50:48.709 --> 02:50:51.331]  ChrisSky on Twitter and ChrisSky on Facebook.
[02:50:51.411 --> 02:50:52.091]  Thank you, everybody.
[02:50:52.391 --> 02:50:53.452]  War Room coming up next.
[02:50:53.852 --> 02:50:54.093]  Cheers.
[02:50:59.249 --> 02:51:04.034]  Remember, only way the dog hunts is you share the links for Bandot Video, InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com.
[02:51:04.054 --> 02:51:06.936]  And I'll throw this out again, is when I plug, we're able to fund our operation.
[02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:08.938]  When I don't, we're close to being shut down.
[02:51:08.978 --> 02:51:10.600]  I'm not trying to be a victim here.
[02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:12.962]  I'm one hell of a fighter, and I've been blessed to be in this fight this long.
[02:51:13.403 --> 02:51:17.847]  But if you don't buy the products, we can't fight effectively, and the enemy will successfully shut us down.
[02:51:17.927 --> 02:51:21.070]  I got a lot of irons in the fire, a lot of stuff going on people don't even know about.
[02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:25.494]  And let's just say this, you see Info Wars, well we're doing a lot more than what you see there.
[02:51:25.614 --> 02:51:28.056]  The enemy's got all my phones tapped, they know what we're doing, it's all legal.
[02:51:28.757 --> 02:51:30.138]  But believe me, we've only begun to fight.
[02:51:30.499 --> 02:51:32.400]  I need a lot of capital if you want to win this fight.
[02:51:32.961 --> 02:51:36.702]  You can't spend your money anywhere that's got more bang for the buck.
[02:51:37.262 --> 02:51:37.882]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:38.202 --> 02:51:38.882]  Dollar for dollar.
[02:51:38.903 --> 02:51:39.543]  Pound for pound.
[02:51:39.583 --> 02:51:42.723]  We're the toughest, meanest, hardcore junkyard dog there is.
[02:51:43.084 --> 02:51:43.984]  Powered by God.
[02:51:44.024 --> 02:51:46.364]  You know, the Energizer bunnies powered by Energizer.
[02:51:46.404 --> 02:51:47.305]  We're powered by God.
[02:51:47.665 --> 02:51:48.305]  We're pathetic.
[02:51:48.585 --> 02:51:50.085]  This is just a flesh bag.
[02:51:50.365 --> 02:51:54.867]  I've got this little pathetic spirit that was made by God and I can see God and God shines through me.
[02:51:55.187 --> 02:51:56.007]  God shines through you.
[02:51:57.182 --> 02:52:00.123]  But I need a platform to attack, and I just want to attack the enemy with truth.
[02:52:00.223 --> 02:52:02.484]  So, please, you've got my commitment to go 110%.
[02:52:02.524 --> 02:52:13.449]  Sometimes I'm going to fall, sometimes I'm going to fail, sometimes I'm going to stumble, sometimes I'm going to blow up, sometimes I'm going to make a fool out of myself, because I'm real, and I'm a sinner, but I love God, and I love justice, and I need capital to fight this war.
[02:52:13.849 --> 02:52:21.893]  So, Vitamineral Fusion is the one thing, if you do anything, for you, for your children, especially if you've got grandparents or parents that are retired or in a nursing home that aren't getting a lot of sun.
[02:52:21.933 --> 02:52:24.374]  You know, the old smart old ladies and old men are out there gardening.
[02:52:24.414 --> 02:52:25.815]  Those are the guys that look like 100 years old.
[02:52:25.875 --> 02:52:28.236]  Well, if you're not getting your D3, you're going to be dead in a hammer.
[02:52:28.256 --> 02:52:29.136]  This has great D3.
[02:52:29.416 --> 02:52:31.297]  It's got all the other essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:52:31.317 --> 02:52:35.319]  96% reviews at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:52:35.439 --> 02:52:36.220]  It's back in stock 50%
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:37.200]  I think so.
[02:53:05.083 --> 02:53:08.265]  You already saw the Roger Stone interview in Florida, got some other big ones coming up.
[02:53:08.566 --> 02:53:11.228]  We're busy beavers here, and you'll see it all here at the InfoWars.
[02:53:11.368 --> 02:53:15.331]  We believe in peace, but we are bringing you the war of information.
[02:53:15.771 --> 02:53:20.295]  And if you attempt to shut our speech down and attack us, we will defend ourselves!
[02:53:20.555 --> 02:53:21.896]  InfoWars!
[02:53:22.156 --> 02:53:23.357]  InfoWars!
[02:53:23.457 --> 02:53:24.738]  InfoWars!
[02:53:29.562 --> 02:53:30.903]  Well, we knew this news was coming.
[02:53:31.761 --> 02:53:34.743]  So I'm not pleased to be proven right yet again, but here it is.
[02:53:35.363 --> 02:53:36.784]  I've got CNBC.
[02:53:37.004 --> 02:53:38.405]  I've got CNBC.
[02:53:38.645 --> 02:53:40.026]  I've got the New York Post.
[02:53:40.566 --> 02:53:41.887]  I mean, I've got them all right here.
[02:53:43.308 --> 02:53:44.649]  And they say, Oh, guess what?
[02:53:45.389 --> 02:53:46.490]  It's not a pandemic.
[02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:48.451]  It's endemic.
[02:53:49.191 --> 02:53:52.833]  Like when they say America is racist and white people are inherently bad.
[02:53:53.394 --> 02:54:00.418]  Racism is endemic amongst them, which is total racism by the establishment and by the left trying to create a race war.
[02:54:01.287 --> 02:54:08.049]  Martin Luther King was right when he said, you judge people by the character of what they do and the content of their deeds.
[02:54:08.429 --> 02:54:09.629]  You don't do it off what color they are.
[02:54:09.649 --> 02:54:10.789]  But that's what they're saying.
[02:54:10.849 --> 02:54:14.110]  Well, now they're saying COVID's endemic.
[02:54:14.170 --> 02:54:19.731]  It's a common cold virus that Bill Gates manipulated and patented so he owns it with Fauci and the UN.
[02:54:20.951 --> 02:54:24.332]  And so the vaccines aren't going to work and it's never going to go away.
[02:54:24.392 --> 02:54:28.273]  And Fauci said last week and Bill Gates said this week that you still won't be able to go outside.
[02:54:29.215 --> 02:54:34.524]  Or go have a job or anything, because if one person dies of COVID in New Zealand or the U.S.
[02:54:34.544 --> 02:54:36.968]  or the U.K., no one can ever go outside again.
[02:54:36.988 --> 02:54:42.677]  People have always died of the flu and always died of the cold, and we know they've lied about the numbers from car wrecks and motorcycle wrecks.
[02:54:43.615 --> 02:54:48.116]  People with heart attacks and cancer and the flu and pneumonia.
[02:54:48.296 --> 02:54:50.136]  All of that, they admit, has been put in the column.
[02:54:50.156 --> 02:54:50.716]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:54:51.037 --> 02:54:52.717]  Don't question the science or you'll be censored.
[02:54:52.957 --> 02:54:53.657]  You'll be fired.
[02:54:54.357 --> 02:55:01.179]  And so the very people that cooked this up at Wuhan and launched it and lied to us about the death numbers, saying 4% would die.
[02:55:01.199 --> 02:55:02.139]  It wasn't even 1-10 to 1%.
[02:55:03.539 --> 02:55:04.839]  We're still supposed to listen to them.
[02:55:05.119 --> 02:55:05.800]  So here's the headline.
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:07.780]  Experts say COVID could become endemic.
[02:55:08.706 --> 02:55:09.507]  Hope that means for you.
[02:55:09.527 --> 02:55:12.290]  And it goes on to say, oh, there'll be new versions.
[02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:14.312]  COVID-19, COVID-20, 2021, 2022.
[02:55:15.733 --> 02:55:18.496]  In fact, even major Hollywood producers.
[02:55:20.219 --> 02:55:26.263]  Have movies coming out like Songbird about how the lockdown's never going to end, never going to stop.
[02:55:26.323 --> 02:55:29.665]  And soon there'll be camps and checkpoints, but that's just a movie, right?
[02:55:29.705 --> 02:55:39.192]  No, they have the contact tracers in Australia, in the UK, and now in Canada, arresting people that try to walk down the street, beating up women, beating up men, strip searching them.
[02:55:39.712 --> 02:55:41.753]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:55:42.154 --> 02:55:49.939]  This is the excuse to take over the producers and break the will of the people that voted for Brexit or voted for Trump or voted for Bolsonaro.
[02:55:51.035 --> 02:55:54.796]  This is a authoritarian takeover and it's so incredibly criminal.
[02:55:54.996 --> 02:55:56.336]  Here's Bill Gates, CNBC.
[02:55:56.676 --> 02:55:57.757]  Bill Gates on mask.
[02:55:58.317 --> 02:56:02.318]  He goes on to say, if you're vaccinated, you can still transmit.
[02:56:03.098 --> 02:56:03.518]  Really?
[02:56:03.698 --> 02:56:04.178]  Wow.
[02:56:06.039 --> 02:56:07.379]  So now you can't go out.
[02:56:08.439 --> 02:56:10.240]  I'm not going to stop wearing mask.
[02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:14.821]  See, because they're never going to let go this power grab.
[02:56:15.301 --> 02:56:15.981]  It's a problem.
[02:56:16.923 --> 02:56:17.063]  That's
[02:56:39.272 --> 02:56:42.133]  All I can tell you is they're coming for our children now.
[02:56:42.253 --> 02:56:52.337]  I've got the articles right here saying now they're going to come and basically give it to school children, the COVID-19 vaccine, when it's an experimental vaccine and they admit COVID doesn't even affect children and the vaccine's dangerous.
[02:56:52.757 --> 02:56:53.958]  This is so incredibly evil.
[02:56:54.338 --> 02:57:00.560]  So help us at InfoWars stay on air for however long God wants to keep us on air and God's going to work through you to decide how long it's going to be.
[02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:02.081]  But I would get your supplements.
[02:57:02.481 --> 02:57:03.721]  I would get you preparing asylums.
[02:57:03.741 --> 02:57:04.682]  I get your storable food.
[02:57:04.782 --> 02:57:07.943]  I would get all those things at InfoWarsStore.com while you still can.
[02:57:08.348 --> 02:57:12.653]  And running through March 6th, we have 10% off of storable food and free shipping.
[02:57:12.673 --> 02:57:13.413]  That's a huge deal.
[02:57:13.433 --> 02:57:13.914]  Never do that.
[02:57:14.294 --> 02:57:18.519]  And up to 50% off of supplements and all the rest of the products at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:57:18.539 --> 02:57:21.181]  So storewide free shipping at mfolwarestore.com.
[02:57:21.682 --> 02:57:24.425]  And a lot more, and it's going to have to end coming up this Saturday.
[02:57:24.765 --> 02:57:26.146]  So please check it out while you still can.
[02:57:26.166 --> 02:57:28.329]  But whatever you do, spread the word about the live broadcast.
