[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:11.155]  This isn't the pop eugenics of, let's strengthen the race of humanity by promoting breeding of individuals with higher IQs or things like this.
[00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:12.415]  And of course that leads to hell.
[00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:13.696]  We know where that goes.
[00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.697]  That's why it's been rejected by the general public.
[00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:17.078]  We had major wars over it.
[00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:19.659]  But now it's back.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.161]  And it's literally trying to sterilize our children.
[00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:25.462]  It's trying to force deadly things into our bodies.
[00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.549]  And so if we can put the headline up from today's show, it says it all right there.
[00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:39.776]  The globalists have triggered their planetary depopulation operation that they promised they were going to do.
[00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:44.480]  And so everybody's having this moment where they're going, wait a minute.
[00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:55.329]  I heard this from Alex Jones, and I heard this from countless other quote, crazy right-wingers in the last 40, 50 years.
[00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.990]  And we never checked into it, because that's just preposterous.
[00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.834]  They're not putting fluoride in the water to lower our IQs.
[00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:07.760]  And then you get Obama's White House czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:26.987]  Who co-wrote the big 1,100-page textbook, Ecoscience, published in 1974, that is a PhD-level book for the elites on how to carry out world government and depopulation and how inoculations and fluoride in the water will be used to lower fertility and IQ.
[00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:30.307]  I mean, they tell you what they're doing!
[00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:35.249]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:49.047]  I'm going to say something very calmly here on air right now on this live Friday, July 9th broadcast.
[00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.730]  And I'm going to just let this sink in for everybody.
[00:01:54.452 --> 00:01:56.994]  I have a stack of news articles here without even looking.
[00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:58.775]  I mean, if I wanted to, I'd find a hundred more.
[00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:07.663]  I have a stack of news articles here with renowned emergency brain surgeons in the United States
[00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:13.348]  And in Italy, and in Australia, without even looking.
[00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:23.795]  It's just in the news that brain trauma surgeons are saying they've never seen brains look like this.
[00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:27.538]  Swollen, bloody messes.
[00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.741]  Holes eaten in all the tissue.
[00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:33.943]  Liquefication!
[00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:38.446]  And now let's let this next part sink in.
[00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:50.580]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and all the usual criminal suspects are blocking that information and saying, that's not from the UN.
[00:02:51.861 --> 00:03:03.963]  So you see the old reports back in the 80s, they had the cop killer bullets that would shoot through vests and they'd see doctors, the trauma doctors, I've never seen a bullet, you know, shoot through things like this, it caused so much damage.
[00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.844]  So they banned those bullets just on the word of some doctors.
[00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:25.783]  Of course, a bullet's supposed to be deadly, but the point is, is that now the most trusted people come out and say this is eating the brains, and it's in the literature, it does it, and it's in all the studies, and holding America and the world underwater, drowning us, killing us, is big tech hiding this.
[00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:26.783]  And I got another article right here.
[00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:32.546]  YouTube caught auto-censoring comments that criticize the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:34.828]  Well, of course they do.
[00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:39.180]  And then they get up there in front of Congress and say, oh, we don't censor anybody.
[00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:46.145]  But then they censor everywhere and the left calls for more censorship and for my show to be taken off the air along with Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:49.508]  It's such an incredible time.
[00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:51.049]  I mean, look at these articles.
[00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:59.535]  Mom 45, who got a job at John Hopkins Hospital, dies in John Hopkins Hospital after she got the second shot.
[00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:03.798]  And they said, yeah, the vaccine reaction swole her brain
[00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.940]  Until all the blood vessels popped.
[00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:11.863]  And it was a long, horrifyingly painful death, the family said.
[00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:16.605]  She went from being in great shape and totally happy to deader than a doornail.
[00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:20.307]  Within a few days of taking the injection.
[00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:21.528]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:23.849]  Beautiful young Italian girl killed by vaccine.
[00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:31.033]  Brain surgeon, renowned brain surgeon, said he's never seen a brain look like this.
[00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.194]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:34.235]  Goes on to describe it.
[00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:40.347]  As the worst thrombosis and neurological trauma.
[00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:46.012]  It crushed her brain.
[00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:50.095]  They had to remove her skull, the top of her skull off.
[00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:50.956]  She still died.
[00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:52.637]  So she's in there with the top of her skull off.
[00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:54.939]  The brain's like, never seen a brain swell like this.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.140]  Bye bye.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.081]  You're dead.
[00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:01.504]  And they're killing everybody right in front of us and testing to see what we'll do.
[00:05:02.946 --> 00:05:04.106]  Because they know that we will
[00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:07.167]  Adapt by not overcoming.
[00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:13.932]  We will adapt by submitting because they've got us in that captured learned helplessness mass Stockholm Syndrome place.
[00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:18.957]  This is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:27.103]  I haven't even gotten into the stack, but they've got people in Australia, the US, Italy, all saying the same thing.
[00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:29.986]  The brains are bloody messes.
[00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:31.907]  The lungs are shredded.
[00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:35.422]  Like somebody shot him with a shotgun, one doctor described.
[00:05:35.442 --> 00:05:36.802]  They just said, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:41.144]  They say over and over again, the autopsies, the autopsies, or they're trying to save these people.
[00:05:41.684 --> 00:05:43.525]  The heart's swelling up.
[00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:46.205]  And you know, if you're 20 and it swells up, you can die.
[00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:46.666]  Some have.
[00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:51.147]  But if you're 70 and got a lot of plaque, your heart swells, arteries close.
[00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:51.967]  Bye-bye.
[00:05:53.408 --> 00:05:53.988]  And you're dead.
[00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:58.710]  And they are killing us with enjoyment.
[00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.851]  And now the feds have announced forced inoculation.
[00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:02.271]  Stay with us.
[00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.361]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 9th.
[00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:08.862]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:09.062 --> 00:06:11.844]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.426]  Well, it's official.
[00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:27.134]  Legislation has been introduced in the House and it looks like it's going to pass to create a new law enforcement body in the Justice Department that will track everyone's medical records.
[00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:31.377]  And if you've been vaccinated, that means whatever they cook up, they want to put in your body.
[00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:34.457]  Gene therapies, you name it.
[00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.220]  And the bill is 666.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:47.968]  And there's another bill called 6666 that is now law, that is the contact tracers coming to your house.
[00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:53.972]  And of course they did not give them those numbers because it was consecutive, because that was just the next bill number.
[00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:57.055]  They chose in committee those numbers to rub it,
[00:06:58.394 --> 00:06:59.675]  in your face.
[00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:02.716]  A little calling card for everybody.
[00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:18.625]  Kind of like the quote gay choir that is a city sponsored in San Francisco saying we're going to corrupt your children, we're coming for your children, we're going to recruit your children.
[00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:22.847]  And of course that is the entire giant
[00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:27.431]  Push everywhere, all over the news, cartoons, movies.
[00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:33.496]  Well, now they come out and say, oh, they were just baiting us, and ha ha ha, they don't really mean it.
[00:07:33.596 --> 00:07:36.979]  But they did take the video down, so they can then misrepresent what was actually said in it.
[00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:51.232]  But we have the video, and we have the statements by these organizations and groups that the left pushes, like the San Francisco government pushes Drag Queen Storytime, which is a man in a clown suit shaking his ass in front of children and having them sit on his pervert lap.
[00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:55.420]  That's why so many get busted being child traffickers, child rapists.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.760]  But oh, no, no, no.
[00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.341]  All they wanted was gay marriage, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:02.762 --> 00:08:13.625]  And so people who are homosexual in the world, who are not child molesters and who are not bad people, because they're heterosexual child molesters and they're homosexual child molesters, they're all equally as bad.
[00:08:14.405 --> 00:08:18.646]  You need to not let the pedophiles claim that they run your movement, because they do now.
[00:08:19.605 --> 00:08:27.233]  And then you can whine and complain, oh, we're getting threats, oh, you hate us because of our sexual choices.
[00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:33.400]  No, no, no, we don't like you because a bunch of creepy men singing a song about you're coming for our children.
[00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:42.325]  And then all the Jocelyn elders wanted to teach elementary students how to masturbate and said, reach down and touch their penis!
[00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:43.306]  Help them!
[00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:45.567]  Remember that came out in congressional testimony?
[00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:50.690]  She said, I died, the teachers need to touch the penis!
[00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:52.912]  I mean, it's pedophilia!
[00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:54.993]  That's what this is!
[00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:56.374]  That's who you are!
[00:08:56.654 --> 00:09:01.457]  That's the operating system of the Vatican now, and the left, and Hollywood, my God!
[00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:04.026]  And it's coming out.
[00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.467]  And so we're going to hit it all today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:13.869]  The massive number of deaths from these poison injections, the literature, the studies that it would do, indeed that.
[00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:22.251]  Fauci did studies at the University of Texas eight years ago and found that this happened in other mammals when you gave them a vaccine that attacks the spike protein.
[00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:28.593]  Makes your body, in a large percentage of people, attack itself.
[00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:43.750]  That might just mean arthritis or heart pain, but if you and your system really, really takes to the vaccine, and your body really decides to attack that spike protein that is in all the damn tissues of your body,
[00:09:45.407 --> 00:09:57.012]  Your most reactive tissues in your ovaries, in your uterus, in your testicles, in your brain, in your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your heart, will become a bloody mess.
[00:09:57.052 --> 00:09:59.553]  Your body will eat holes in itself.
[00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:01.394]  You will reject your body.
[00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:06.736]  You all heard of people getting a liver transplant and they gotta give them anti-rejection drugs because the body's like, I don't know what this is.
[00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:10.558]  And then you've got all the rest of it.
[00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.075]  But I'm going to air a very special report here that just went live at Band.Video and FreeWorldNews.TV.
[00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:25.343]  It is an extremely powerful Greg Reese report dealing with the fact that we are all under globalist mind control.
[00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:27.445]  We must declare independence against it.
[00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:30.027]  And Britney Spears is a great case point example.
[00:10:39.734 --> 00:10:49.602]  Britney Spears and several other big names were groomed to star in the new Mickey Mouse Club during a time the company was rife with pedophiles.
[00:10:50.382 --> 00:11:05.274]  Dozens of Disney employees have been arrested for child sex crimes including top executives and directors and in some cases rehired by Disney to work with children after doing extremely short jail time for raping a child actor.
[00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:13.078]  Former Disney Chairman and Democrat Senator George Mitchell was identified as a pedophile who visited Epstein Island.
[00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:18.660]  And before that, Ghislaine Maxwell was doing photo ops for Disney's Save the Children.
[00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:24.223]  Several former child stars have claimed that the industry is crawling with pedophiles.
[00:11:24.823 --> 00:11:26.764]  We have already heard many of their stories.
[00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:31.847]  If we can look at the evidence and overcome our emotions, we can see what this is.
[00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:48.010]  Trauma-based mind control programs, such as MKUltra and Project Monarch, were revealed to the public via declassified documents in the 70s, and again in the 90s, with several victims giving testimony before Congress.
[00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:59.879]  The basis of these programs is the routine infliction of severe trauma upon a child, in order to force their mind into a dissociative state, allowing them to be controlled without awareness.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:12.965]  Up until the age of seven, children live mostly in a hypnotic state of mind, when their sense of reality is being written, which explains why they target children, specifically those that come from abusive households.
[00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:28.290]  Bryce Taylor and Kathy O'Brien have each described in their books how they were regularly brought to Disneyland and Disney World, where they would be tortured and raped while being programmed with Disney stories, as well as Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.
[00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.431]  This has been verified in CIA documents.
[00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:41.353]  O'Brien says she was tortured in a room beneath Disney World, which we know was designed by agents of the CIA, who were running this program at that time.
[00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:46.094]  Victims of these programs were sold into them by their abusive parents.
[00:12:47.114 --> 00:12:51.915]  A model we see today with parents pimping their children out to the entertainment industry.
[00:12:52.955 --> 00:13:07.679]  Brittany's parents had her audition for Disney when she was eight years old, where she was then brought into the industry, sent to New York City for training, and brought on the show three years later at age 11, where she was dressed and directed to perform like an adult.
[00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:17.965]  The art of mind control was known as far back as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where people's belief systems were being created by illusions force-fed into their minds.
[00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:19.046]  Story.
[00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:22.589]  Our imagination has always been influenced by story.
[00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:25.771]  And if you can control the stories told to the public,
[00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:28.073]  You can control their imagination.
[00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:35.220]  Since the dawn of television, visual storytelling has been the most fundamental form of mind control in the modern world.
[00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:36.461]  Television.
[00:13:37.202 --> 00:13:37.582]  Movies.
[00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:38.864]  Videos.
[00:13:39.544 --> 00:13:44.449]  And since the beginning, we have been subjected to a long-term agenda of sexual subversion.
[00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.614]  As each generation is born, the stimuli becomes slightly more perverse.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:14:01.323]  As the Mickey Mouse Club grew old, their young impressionable audience grew to perceive them as highly successful while flaunting sexual promiscuity and sexual assault.
[00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:06.304]  You can destroy a society by destroying its sexual morality.
[00:14:06.865 --> 00:14:10.265]  This is fundamental in any society based on the family.
[00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:18.688]  When our children are naturally in this theta brainwave state of hypnotic learning, they should be protected within the family and learn from them.
[00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:20.228]  Organically.
[00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:29.292]  But the emerging global state, now being forced on us by multinational corporations and big banks, want to destroy this society.
[00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:34.195]  They want to mold our children, exploit them, and even castrate them.
[00:14:35.255 --> 00:14:38.937]  It is now being promoted in highly produced, inspirational show tunes.
[00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.179]  And they draft laws to help facilitate all of this.
[00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:55.547]  A Republican senator who has produced such films as Breeding Farm, about women being kidnapped and forcibly bred for babies to be sold on the black market before they are fed to cannibals, is pushing a bill to fund film and television.
[00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:57.448]  This is the new normal.
[00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.731]  This is the inverted reality being programmed into our minds.
[00:15:02.884 --> 00:15:06.405]  Decades of traumatic abuse has demonstrably hurt Britney Spears.
[00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:10.106]  The human mind can only handle so much for so long.
[00:15:10.986 --> 00:15:14.087]  Britney is a tragic symptom of society's indifference.
[00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:19.569]  Because if enough of us really wanted to, we could change all of this right now.
[00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:22.910]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:32.345]  Bradley Spears, MKUltra, and the destruction of America and then the world.
[00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:34.206]  It's live at BandOnVideo.
[00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:37.408]  The sleeper must awaken.
[00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:57.242]  If they can put you into a trance, a twilight daydream, they can manipulate you by increments until you finally wake up and are a demon-possessed monster.
[00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:27.359]  Got some footage I'm gonna roll some b-roll of here in just a moment of a man running around in California up the side of a building and attacking a church and setting the cross on fire and then jumping from building
[00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:41.717]  To building like someone out of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
[00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:51.644]  And this is happening all over the Western world where you have drugs, pharmaceuticals, Hollywood.
[00:16:54.887 --> 00:16:58.369]  Man wearing only boxers and one sock climbs Los Angeles church.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:12.223]  There are hundreds of churches a week in Europe being burned.
[00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.244]  The majority have been burned to the ground.
[00:17:15.644 --> 00:17:28.867]  And when the Muslims and a consortium of devil worshippers just spiritually dialed into this force, go and burn them down, the news covers up that it was a targeted event like Notre Dame.
[00:17:32.532 --> 00:17:33.673]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:51.249]  They are drawn, when in that lowered state, when their conscious mind and spirit has been removed from the controls, to be nothing more than an avatar driven by a force that desires to burn down churches and rape children.
[00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:58.836]  And if you go to any Democrat event, or you go to an Antifa event, or you even go to a mainline pro-choice event,
[00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:08.042]  Women in Stepford Wife outfits will tell you they love Satan and start sticking their tongues out and licking their lips.
[00:18:09.263 --> 00:18:12.265]  And, I mean, we've caught it on tape countless times.
[00:18:14.006 --> 00:18:17.689]  I went when they had an event called Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and the Fake News.
[00:18:17.709 --> 00:18:19.470]  They shut down part of downtown a few years ago.
[00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.132]  I, of course, was not invited.
[00:18:21.152 --> 00:18:24.134]  They tried to have police throw me out, but the cops wouldn't do it.
[00:18:24.774 --> 00:18:27.657]  And so it's just open air in the street with a big stage.
[00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:37.174]  And men came over and began to tell me that they like to have sex with children and shake their butts at me.
[00:18:38.294 --> 00:18:44.398]  And they look like the men that you see in the quote, gay choir, that says it's coming for your children, it's going to corrupt your children.
[00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:53.963]  And so when you're around these people, they're weak, they're pathetic, they're stupid, they look very unhealthy, they can be white, they can be black, they can be Hispanic, they're usually white.
[00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:57.285]  And they're all very, very Nelly.
[00:18:59.192 --> 00:19:07.998]  But that fake feminine spirit is just an act as a cover for what unbelievable monsters they are.
[00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:19.966]  These are ugly, gross men who are driven by a spirit that absolutely wants to destroy innocence and take these children down with them.
[00:19:20.546 --> 00:19:25.630]  Because when you look at these men and the looks in their faces and how they act, they are enslaved.
[00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:29.433]  There is a spirit in control of them.
[00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:33.016]  And it's hideous.
[00:19:34.717 --> 00:19:36.238]  And it doesn't want life on this earth.
[00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:38.680]  It wants to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:46.247]  It wants to make sure the children have no parents and can be swallowed into a satanic abyss by these individuals.
[00:19:47.788 --> 00:19:53.833]  The Washington Post said last week, take your children to gay pride parades and let them see the kink.
[00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.548]  Let them see people eating feces.
[00:19:57.168 --> 00:19:58.748]  Let them see people cutting themselves.
[00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:00.629]  Let them see people in bondage.
[00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.431]  And what is their response now that they've done this?
[00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:11.713]  Jay Men's Chorus jokes about converting kids and Alex Jones pounces.
[00:20:13.094 --> 00:20:17.776]  They go on to say it was just a troll and that Alex Jones said kill everybody.
[00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:18.696]  I didn't know such thing.
[00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:21.893]  And so now the FBI's been called.
[00:20:22.253 --> 00:20:25.174]  Well, I mean, so many of the FBI are pedophiles now.
[00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:28.995]  Hell, they probably will be upset that I'm trying to get in the way of them and children.
[00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:38.978]  But... You really should be calling the FBI on an organization of men?
[00:20:40.478 --> 00:20:44.859]  Meeting and saying, we're coming to corrupt your children, we're coming for them, we're coming to get them?
[00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:52.092]  That's a pretty scary thing when a group of men, but see, they all wear rainbow and go, oh, hi, how you doing?
[00:20:52.112 --> 00:20:52.773]  Oh, I like you.
[00:20:53.253 --> 00:21:04.023]  Highest rate of suicide, highest rate of hurting each other, totally unhappy because of the culture in and around it that is so incredibly disgusting and anti-human.
[00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:09.688]  It's a, it's a pedophile army.
[00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:12.691]  And in my view,
[00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:30.813]  If the FBI raided the gay San Francisco choir, I would bet that a large percentage of those men have child porn on their computers, and I bet a large percentage of them are sex offenders already.
[00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:39.236]  Just like routinely, I said, somebody should run the background check on this drag queen story time in Houston, and both the men that lead it
[00:21:40.546 --> 00:21:44.769]  Raped 8 and 9 year olds separately, in aggravated assault in both cases.
[00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:49.732]  Kidnapped children, took one in a shed, bent him over and raped him at age 8.
[00:21:50.653 --> 00:21:54.796]  Other one, basically, go read the story, grabbed them and raped them as well.
[00:21:58.478 --> 00:22:07.064]  I mean, they'll grab your kid out of a backyard, they'll bend him over, and they'll rape him, and in California it's legal for them to give your child HIV or Hepatitis.
[00:22:08.124 --> 00:22:08.585]  Knowingly!
[00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:10.892]  They call it bug chasing.
[00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:21.596]  They have even articles in Rolling Stone 20 years ago, back before Rolling Stone was a thousand percent evil, saying, hey, gay men, you need to stop trying to give each other HIV and hepatitis.
[00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:25.758]  They call it gift givers and gift receivers.
[00:22:26.918 --> 00:22:31.360]  And they want to give your child the gift of death because it's a death cult.
[00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:36.002]  I don't hate lesbians because they like women.
[00:22:36.806 --> 00:22:39.287]  I've been around the block a few times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:40.387]  I like women, too.
[00:22:40.707 --> 00:22:43.408]  Hell, it's like saying, you've got a taste for red wine.
[00:22:43.468 --> 00:22:46.209]  So do I. It's not that the women like women.
[00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:52.290]  It's that everything that comes with it, the anti-male, the anti-family, the chip on the shoulder, the support of the police state.
[00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:53.651]  What's wrong with you people?
[00:22:55.611 --> 00:23:04.174]  Why are you so into getting around kids with a bunch of pervert men just staring at these children like they're a lion and the child is a gazelle?
[00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:10.995]  These are just blasted beyond hell individuals.
[00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:16.495]  Creepy men dressed up like women, you know, like Psycho!
[00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:25.097]  And Albert Hitchcock's Psycho dresses up like his mother because he killed her because she's in the basement stuffed!
[00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:29.358]  Psychologists know what all this is!
[00:23:30.078 --> 00:23:35.239]  And now, oh, the schools are having talks with your elementary students about, you're really a girl.
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:36.619]  We're going to give you a lot of attention because you are.
[00:23:36.639 --> 00:23:37.319]  We're going to send you
[00:23:38.584 --> 00:24:07.614]  To this gender reassignment thing, and if your parents don't like it, in most jurisdictions now, they will take your children from you, the CPS will, and put them in another home with a bunch of these perverts that don't just want to stick their members in your children, they want to chop their testicles and penises off, and chop little girls' breasts off, because the end goal is to mutilate and attack what God created, the power of men and women coming together in our trillions of whatever
[00:24:07.994 --> 00:24:14.218]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to plunge into all the news and tie it together here.
[00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:31.090]  The Satanism, the pedophilia, the open declaration of war against humanity, the externalization of Satan's plan here on this planet, the spiritual battle, the churches rolling over and doing nothing to fight it, and where this capitulation is going to take us very, very quickly.
[00:24:32.222 --> 00:24:37.306]  And just how hellish things are going to get before humanity finally wakes up and comes back up for air.
[00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:39.447]  That really is up to us.
[00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:40.228]  We have free will.
[00:24:41.528 --> 00:24:49.194]  But before I go any further, please remember it is viewers and listeners that keep this independent, powerful media operation on air.
[00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:53.162]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever before.
[00:24:53.843 --> 00:24:55.445]  We're more influential than ever before.
[00:24:55.565 --> 00:25:00.531]  What we talk about is being proven to be accurate, and our credibility is exploding.
[00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.293]  And all glory goes to God.
[00:25:05.517 --> 00:25:09.182]  And I just want to thank the listeners who God's worked through with your action.
[00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:13.095]  You're spreading the word, all the different ways you do it.
[00:25:13.215 --> 00:25:20.059]  You have really taken action steadfastly, and I just want to thank you for keeping me in the fight.
[00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:24.942]  And when you're in the fight, you are just as important as I am, or President Trump, or anybody else.
[00:25:25.842 --> 00:25:29.865]  We can all sit there and, you know, say this person should have done better there, or that person could have done better here.
[00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:30.605]  Doesn't matter.
[00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:33.667]  We love God, we love children, we love justice, and
[00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:40.426]  We're not backing down, we're not giving in, because it is a spiritual attack that we are under.
[00:25:41.466 --> 00:25:46.489]  And evil wants us to accept it in the name of just being friends and being nice, but that's not what evil wants.
[00:25:46.969 --> 00:25:57.455]  It wants to enslave us and destroy us, and it uses those that it has under its control, whether it's a heterosexual pedophile, or a homosexual pedophile, or whatever these people are,
[00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:06.913]  They have a desire, like a man in the desert wants water, they want to destroy innocents like a man in the desert needs water.
[00:26:07.973 --> 00:26:09.635]  Or like a starving man needs bread.
[00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.397]  And it is their drive.
[00:26:12.417 --> 00:26:26.588]  And when you see Michael Avenatti, and you see Hunter Biden, and you see these people, and they look like these husks, they look like jack-o'-lanterns, there's like a flickering light coming out of their eye, because it's not them.
[00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:28.164]  They're gone.
[00:26:28.624 --> 00:26:39.092]  Something is repulsive about them because your humanity sees that the lights are home, but nobody's home.
[00:26:40.973 --> 00:26:42.154]  To quote Mark Chestnut.
[00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:48.760]  So, there isn't a place that you can buy products where it's gonna have a bigger effect.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:55.445]  These are dynamite, high-end products that fund the info war
[00:26:56.826 --> 00:26:58.166]  And will also change your life.
[00:26:58.606 --> 00:26:59.207]  Here's an example.
[00:26:59.607 --> 00:27:10.089]  Everybody likes green capsules, concentrated vegetables, because it's known to be really good for your guts and fiber and processing it.
[00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:14.210]  We have one finally, after years of trying to get a really high-end one that just came in.
[00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.350]  We'll be promoting it next week.
[00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:21.192]  And it's the most expensive formula you could find anywhere.
[00:27:21.552 --> 00:27:24.673]  The amount of money that goes into each bottle, but we're still going to sell it at a very low price.
[00:27:24.993 --> 00:27:25.993]  Because most supplements
[00:27:27.069 --> 00:27:29.011]  Have a five to six times markup.
[00:27:29.151 --> 00:27:29.972]  We don't do that.
[00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:35.476]  And still, just some crappy greens concentrates in these things.
[00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:36.417]  It helps people.
[00:27:36.437 --> 00:27:37.518]  People take it because it works.
[00:27:38.099 --> 00:27:41.762]  This is high-end, quality, concentrated.
[00:27:42.242 --> 00:27:45.745]  Everything we have is the highest quality we can get.
[00:27:47.927 --> 00:27:49.809]  And so, it will end this weekend.
[00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.172]  We've extended the sale because people only buy stuff when it's on sale.
[00:27:53.232 --> 00:27:53.792]  I understand that.
[00:27:53.812 --> 00:27:54.333]  I'm the same way.
[00:27:56.069 --> 00:27:58.090]  Free Shipping Double Patriot Points will end this weekend.
[00:28:00.372 --> 00:28:01.773]  The Free Shipping will end this weekend.
[00:28:01.793 --> 00:28:03.274]  The Double Patriot Points will end this weekend.
[00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:07.717]  But I'm going to sell the X2 at 40% off until it is gone.
[00:28:08.357 --> 00:28:11.560]  And at current sales rates, that's in about two weeks, because I have to get the money in here.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.481]  Even though it'll be months and months until more comes in.
[00:28:13.521 --> 00:28:15.242]  It's the good halogen, deep red crystal iodine.
[00:28:15.622 --> 00:28:18.264]  We've already sold out of the X3, or it's about to.
[00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:19.205]  It's gone back to regular price.
[00:28:21.084 --> 00:28:23.065]  We've got Turbo Force 40% off.
[00:28:23.205 --> 00:28:24.165]  It's about to sell out.
[00:28:24.425 --> 00:28:25.725]  Alpha Power 40% off.
[00:28:26.025 --> 00:28:27.106]  Basil Obese 50% off.
[00:28:27.146 --> 00:28:28.166]  Pollen Block 40% off.
[00:28:28.546 --> 00:28:31.067]  Super Mel Vitality 50% off.
[00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:31.847]  It's amazing.
[00:28:32.447 --> 00:28:34.588]  Cold-pressed, that's the big difference.
[00:28:35.168 --> 00:28:42.790]  It's the same stuff that's in Alpha Power, but it takes five, six times, they tell me, more of the herbs because it's cold-pressed one time.
[00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:44.671]  It's like wine.
[00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:45.731]  It's never heated.
[00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:54.282]  And so technically, it's weaker than alpha power, but it's way stronger because you can't measure that live enzyme of these herbs and how they do it.
[00:28:54.302 --> 00:28:57.523]  It's the top place in the country, and we private label it and it goes on and on.
[00:28:57.563 --> 00:29:01.964]  But this is what all the elites and people take is Super Mill Vitality under another name.
[00:29:02.024 --> 00:29:06.344]  It's been out for 50 years, produced in Utah, and they're nice enough to let us do it.
[00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:09.245]  I'd call them liberals too, but they're like real liberals.
[00:29:09.265 --> 00:29:12.366]  You know, they care about the earth and their health, and they know about the new world order and all that.
[00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:14.566]  But it's definitely some high-end stuff.
[00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:18.636]  And then it just continues on from there.
[00:29:18.716 --> 00:29:23.026]  Infowarsstore.com also has the ultimate krill oil, highest grade of krill oil, 40% off.
[00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:25.672]  You know, some comedians have had some fun with that.
[00:29:26.638 --> 00:29:27.559]  I made some jokes about it.
[00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:28.920]  In fact, see if you can pull it up from yesterday, guys.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.344]  It's like a 40-second clip of Alex Jones talking about krill oil.
[00:29:33.724 --> 00:29:34.885]  They get it wrong and say fish oil.
[00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:35.686]  Fish oil is great, too.
[00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:36.547]  We have high-end fish oil.
[00:29:36.987 --> 00:29:44.474]  But krill oil, the dreams you have when you take it, at least I and others do, and what it does to your cardiovascular system, your body, your brain, everything, it's just amazing.
[00:29:44.894 --> 00:29:50.539]  And again, this is the highest grade of krill oil you're going to find out there.
[00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.381]  Did you guys find that comedian piece?
[00:29:53.661 --> 00:29:54.501]  I know I just sprung it on you.
[00:29:54.921 --> 00:30:00.063]  A little bit of comic relief, but I guess someone hearing this is like, wow, this sounds crazy.
[00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:01.763]  But it's really true.
[00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:05.584]  What's in high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil is just the next level.
[00:30:06.584 --> 00:30:09.225]  And again, this will give you the fish burps, which I don't like.
[00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:11.986]  But if you're not getting fish burps, folks, it's not the real deal.
[00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:12.726]  Okay.
[00:30:13.267 --> 00:30:19.591]  Anything out there that's telling you it's the real deal and doesn't give you fish burps, it's a byproduct that goes with it.
[00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.253]  So, I take it when I go to sleep at night.
[00:30:21.533 --> 00:30:22.734]  When I don't take it, I feel it.
[00:30:23.554 --> 00:30:24.495]  My dreams aren't as good.
[00:30:24.535 --> 00:30:26.677]  I mean, it's like a drug, literally, for me.
[00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:29.239]  Acryl oil and fish oil when they're high end.
[00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:31.320]  So, here's a comedian making a joke about it.
[00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:33.502]  Dude, look at the camera.
[00:30:33.522 --> 00:30:34.403]  Dude, do the whole thing.
[00:30:34.423 --> 00:30:34.483]  Go.
[00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.311]  You ever seen fish oil like this?
[00:30:38.131 --> 00:30:38.871]  No, you haven't.
[00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:41.812]  You've always seen it all brown, and this one's all yellowy.
[00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:47.595]  And the reason that you see it is because I want my audience to have goodwill!
[00:30:47.875 --> 00:30:51.856]  Because if you get that goodwill, I get your goodwill!
[00:30:52.076 --> 00:30:53.337]  Don't you understand the book's secret?
[00:30:54.357 --> 00:30:59.079]  This little pill right here is solid gold liquid consciousness.
[00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:00.259]  You don't believe me?
[00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:00.700]  Look it up!
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.341]  Look up fish oil and then buy it at alexjones.cominfowars.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:15.306]  I like that.
[00:31:16.887 --> 00:31:18.588]  And I will come on your podcast if you'd like.
[00:31:19.249 --> 00:31:21.450]  By the way, folks, I've always wanted to do comedy.
[00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.172]  Joe Rogan tells me I really need to do it.
[00:31:24.392 --> 00:31:28.415]  And I guess if I get good enough, you know, I'll get to go on tour with Joe and Dave Chappelle.
[00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:32.759]  So I've got to go ahead, though, and go out there and
[00:31:33.717 --> 00:31:34.678]  Is that a joke, CNN?
[00:31:34.738 --> 00:31:37.500]  I know Brian Stelter's like, who's Alex Jones friends with?
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.380]  Who's he involved with?
[00:31:38.821 --> 00:31:41.783]  I'm supposed to tell you who you can talk to and who you can't.
[00:31:41.803 --> 00:31:52.370]  You think Brian Stelter will get jealous if I open up, say, a year from now for Joe Rogan to say 30,000 people in Dallas at the American Airlines Center or something like that?
[00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.151]  Just hypothetical.
[00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:55.052]  Think CNN would like that?
[00:31:56.713 --> 00:31:58.714]  Oh, let me tell you something else fun.
[00:32:00.816 --> 00:32:02.177]  Are you ready for pay-per-view?
[00:32:03.743 --> 00:32:05.344]  Alex Jones takes on 10 Maggots.
[00:32:06.385 --> 00:32:07.366]  Oh, it's in the works.
[00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:08.527]  It's in the works.
[00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:17.154]  See, because I've decided this stuff's so serious, this news is so out of control, that we also need to really screw with the globalist brains and have fun at the same time.
[00:32:17.634 --> 00:32:18.595]  Because we're not against fun.
[00:32:18.615 --> 00:32:19.376]  We're not against that.
[00:32:20.717 --> 00:32:21.157]  No, we're not.
[00:32:21.317 --> 00:32:22.138]  We're not against that.
[00:32:22.218 --> 00:32:23.459]  So I am going to start.
[00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:27.322]  I am going to start doing comedy.
[00:32:28.403 --> 00:32:30.385]  And we are doing it here on the air quite a bit.
[00:32:31.497 --> 00:32:32.377]  I can hear the news now.
[00:32:32.877 --> 00:32:37.439]  Jones admits he's an actor and it's all fake because he does comedy.
[00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:37.559]  Uh, no.
[00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:40.580]  That's not how it works.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.382]  You can be a radio talk show host and be very serious, and then you can go do a comedy piece, but they think the public's so dumb.
[00:32:49.422 --> 00:32:51.703]  It's like, Jones's lawyer admits he's all fake.
[00:32:51.743 --> 00:32:52.003]  Really?
[00:32:52.463 --> 00:32:54.284]  I've offered a million dollars for whoever can find that.
[00:32:54.304 --> 00:32:54.844]  It's not true.
[00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:56.024]  You see it all over the news every day.
[00:32:56.404 --> 00:32:58.165]  Oh, Jones admitted he plays a character on air.
[00:32:58.445 --> 00:32:59.065]  Uh, no I didn't.
[00:33:00.213 --> 00:33:02.756]  It's not true, this is me, this is Alex Jones, this is the real deal.
[00:33:03.937 --> 00:33:09.963]  But yes, when I play Cobra Commander, to illustrate tyranny, Cobra Commander says take your vaccines!
[00:33:10.704 --> 00:33:16.170]  I'm obviously not trying to deceive you that Cobra Commander is real, or that Deathstroke is real.
[00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:19.195]  Autobots rule out.
[00:33:19.335 --> 00:33:20.996]  You know, I don't really think I'm Optimus Prime.
[00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:21.656]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.096 --> 00:33:25.557]  We'll be right back, and I'm going to get into the really hardcore news on the other side.
[00:33:26.398 --> 00:33:30.679]  But I am intending to battle midgets, so it'll be my greatest victory yet.
[00:33:30.699 --> 00:33:31.139]  Stay with us.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.180]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday edition.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.562]  Michael Malice is going to be in studio with us in the third hour today.
[00:33:39.582 --> 00:33:46.604]  By the way, I just had the crew during the break saying, are you really going to fight 10 midgets, and is this going to be real or staged?
[00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:50.093]  And the answer is, no, that's in the works.
[00:33:50.214 --> 00:33:56.319]  With a big organization, big national group, they've been wanting me to do something like this for a while, and I said, what about midgets?
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.063]  And no, I mean, with boxing gloves, I think ten of them will probably beat my ass pretty bad.
[00:34:01.244 --> 00:34:02.906]  And that's kind of the fun of the thing.
[00:34:03.927 --> 00:34:06.369]  And so, if it's for charity and stuff, it's also a good thing.
[00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.192]  And this is no joke.
[00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:12.555]  They would like me to secondly challenge Brian Stelter.
[00:34:14.056 --> 00:34:16.718]  Brian Stelter is one of the most loathed, hated people in the world.
[00:34:17.459 --> 00:34:24.525]  And so at a certain point, this is not a joke by the way, being deadly serious here, Brian Stelter is going to be challenged by myself.
[00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:27.708]  And I don't know, Brian's probably, looks like a pretty big wimp to me.
[00:34:28.008 --> 00:34:29.430]  I'll give Brian two midgets.
[00:34:30.794 --> 00:34:32.755]  So I'll fight Brian with the big heavy gloves.
[00:34:33.235 --> 00:34:34.315]  He gets two extra midgets.
[00:34:35.016 --> 00:34:35.536]  He gets two.
[00:34:35.556 --> 00:34:40.398]  So that'll be my, you know, the handicap there in the match.
[00:34:40.538 --> 00:34:42.859]  Or maybe he wants to forego the midgets.
[00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:49.141]  Maybe he just thinks that he can, you know, because I mean cardiovascularly I'm not in very good shape.
[00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:50.441]  I sit around too much.
[00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:53.743]  But I think I can beat Stolter in one round.
[00:34:53.783 --> 00:34:56.744]  I think I probably can beat the living snot out of him.
[00:34:57.892 --> 00:35:00.873]  In a loving way, in a sanctioned fight where he agrees to it.
[00:35:00.893 --> 00:35:02.593]  I would never assault Brian Stelter.
[00:35:02.613 --> 00:35:05.753]  The last thing I'd want is anyone to assault Brian Stelter and turn him into a victim.
[00:35:06.914 --> 00:35:12.575]  Or maybe I'm a manager of midgets, he's a manager of midgets, and then we just have... Who would be the heel, though?
[00:35:12.595 --> 00:35:13.415]  Who would be the bad guy?
[00:35:13.915 --> 00:35:15.275]  I think Brian Stelter would need to be the bad guy.
[00:35:16.195 --> 00:35:17.496]  Or maybe I'd be the bad guy.
[00:35:18.376 --> 00:35:19.256]  You know what I'm doing right now?
[00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:21.016]  I don't really want to cover this news.
[00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:22.997]  I have a responsibility to do this.
[00:35:23.117 --> 00:35:24.577]  I'm really genuinely freaked out.
[00:35:26.024 --> 00:35:49.995]  And I've been coming to the grips with the fact that they really promised to bring in world government and they've executed world government and they promised to depopulate us and they started it and they have to start somewhere and they have to go from just fluoride to dumb us down and make us infertile and give us cancer to just outright giving us a shot that kills a good percentage of people and then maims others and then kills them down the road and it's in all the literature and it's everywhere.
[00:35:51.809 --> 00:35:56.414]  And I do want to just run off to the mountains and go fly fishing and just forget any of this ever happened.
[00:35:56.434 --> 00:35:57.034]  Here's the problem.
[00:35:57.315 --> 00:35:58.496]  They're not going to let you do that.
[00:35:58.516 --> 00:36:03.661]  I mean, you know, with the contact tracers and all this, that they're going to come to their political enemies' houses.
[00:36:03.981 --> 00:36:07.865]  They've already said, we're going to Republican areas because they're the ones refusing.
[00:36:08.506 --> 00:36:10.227]  It's all being done day one.
[00:36:11.108 --> 00:36:12.189]  Strike forces.
[00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.310]  What are the terms?
[00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.192]  Strike forces.
[00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:16.953]  We're gonna go door-to-door.
[00:36:16.973 --> 00:36:18.274]  We're gonna hunt you down.
[00:36:18.474 --> 00:36:19.194]  These are quotes.
[00:36:20.515 --> 00:36:21.955]  We have all Bloomberg.
[00:36:22.135 --> 00:36:26.977]  We have administration officials saying we have every right to your personal data if you've been inoculated or not.
[00:36:27.898 --> 00:36:29.178]  We paid for it after all.
[00:36:29.598 --> 00:36:34.200]  That's a quote and we're gonna come to your house whether you like it or not.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.060]  I mean these are quotes.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.241]  Would you like me to play the video?
[00:36:37.892 --> 00:36:39.073]  We're gonna hunt you down.
[00:36:39.093 --> 00:36:42.976]  You're like, oh well that's Australia, that's New Zealand, that's Spain.
[00:36:43.436 --> 00:36:46.418]  No, that's here, that's Canada, that's starting now.
[00:36:46.438 --> 00:36:50.862]  You mean to play the head of the UN directive saying on a planetary scale they're gonna do this?
[00:36:52.203 --> 00:36:53.704]  It's all happening.
[00:36:55.706 --> 00:37:01.050]  And that's why signature reduction is so incredibly important, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:02.006 --> 00:37:07.669]  Signature reduction is beyond important because we want to stop this political takeover.
[00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:09.050]  We want to stop this authoritarian drive.
[00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:14.293]  But at the same time, we also want to frustrate their criminal operations at every level we can.
[00:37:15.526 --> 00:37:17.247]  So let me hit you with just some of these headlines.
[00:37:17.307 --> 00:37:23.449]  I'm going to drill back into this and tie it into the pedophile explosion and all the rest of it.
[00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:23.949]  But here it is.
[00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:32.392]  Mom, 45, who got a job at John Hopkins Hospital, dies after reaction to work-mandated COVID vaccine.
[00:37:32.712 --> 00:37:33.673]  She said she didn't want it.
[00:37:34.926 --> 00:37:47.990]  But they made her take it, and then days after taking the second shot, her family said on Facebook, she started having convulsions, was hospitalized, her brain swole up, they put her on a ventilator, and she died.
[00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:51.552]  By the way, even the Times of Israel reports 80-plus percent.
[00:37:53.032 --> 00:37:56.073]  And guys, I know I sent that to you, but I think I lost it in my stack.
[00:37:56.593 --> 00:37:59.534]  Just reprint me that, because I actually sent you the article.
[00:37:59.554 --> 00:38:01.135]  It's actually a photo of the Times of Israel.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.121]  Because I want the actual number, it was like 84%, 85%, I forget.
[00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:12.862]  Of the people in the hospital with COVID and those dying of COVID have had the vaccine.
[00:38:12.882 --> 00:38:16.943]  So they're going, oh, the vaccine doesn't work, people are dying of COVID.
[00:38:17.163 --> 00:38:20.124]  No, the vaccine kills you, and then they say it's COVID.
[00:38:20.284 --> 00:38:20.824]  Comprende?
[00:38:20.884 --> 00:38:25.325]  I mean, this is so diabolical, but excuse me.
[00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:32.610]  Mom45, who got job at John Hopkins Hospital, dies after reaction to work-mandated COVID vaccine.
[00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:33.590]  You ought to read about her.
[00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:34.531]  You ought to read her Facebook.
[00:38:34.991 --> 00:38:35.891]  But you better read it quick.
[00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:40.952]  Most people that die, they take their Facebooks down because, you know, you can't humanize the folks being killed.
[00:38:41.192 --> 00:38:42.652]  You've got to make sure you cover up the murder.
[00:38:44.852 --> 00:38:48.073]  Got to make sure you don't organize the people so that they don't know what's hitting them.
[00:38:48.373 --> 00:38:51.334]  Beautiful young Italian girl killed by vaccine.
[00:38:51.394 --> 00:38:52.634]  Bunch of big articles on this.
[00:38:53.814 --> 00:38:55.815]  We've got it up at Infowars.com as well.
[00:38:56.575 --> 00:39:03.078]  Surgeon, the brain surgeon who operated on the young Italian vaccine victim says, you've never seen anything like this.
[00:39:03.538 --> 00:39:06.019]  The brain swole up so bad with thrombosis.
[00:39:06.819 --> 00:39:11.801]  I've never seen a brain affected by such an extensive severe thrombosis.
[00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:16.103]  So they removed the top of her head and she's just in there.
[00:39:16.123 --> 00:39:20.445]  They're spraying saline on the brain so it doesn't get damaged too much when it's out in the open.
[00:39:21.937 --> 00:39:26.799]  They put a plastic bag over it, and then she survived a few days and just kept swelling and swelling and swelling and she died.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.181]  And there's the Delta Pfizer shot studied in Israel.
[00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:41.965]  And then it goes on to report that again, the vast majority of people, again, who were sick with COVID had the COVID shot, but they don't put two and two together, of course.
[00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:45.326]  So let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:47.058 --> 00:39:48.159]  Let's go to this next report.
[00:39:48.779 --> 00:39:52.020]  Surgeon who operated on young Italian vaccine victim.
[00:39:52.401 --> 00:39:53.921]  You have never seen anything like this.
[00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:54.422]  Continuing.
[00:39:55.642 --> 00:39:57.023]  Biden administration official.
[00:39:57.383 --> 00:40:01.765]  Absolutely the government's business to know, that's a quote, whether you've been vaccinated or not.
[00:40:01.785 --> 00:40:13.590]  See they just broke down that whole wall of your medical privacy and they're gonna share it with everybody and that's just the way it is with restaurants, with everybody, with businesses, just a big gang of corporations raping the living snot out of you with government.
[00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:14.791]  Another one.
[00:40:17.108 --> 00:40:20.689]  Video, CNN doctor says it's time to start mandating.
[00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:22.250]  Yes, and France is saying it.
[00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.330]  They're all saying it.
[00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.311]  It's time to make you take an experimental deadly shot.
[00:40:27.632 --> 00:40:28.972]  By the way, I never played this two days ago.
[00:40:29.012 --> 00:40:29.853]  You guys had the clip.
[00:40:30.573 --> 00:40:31.393]  Try to dig it up for me.
[00:40:31.453 --> 00:40:35.915]  Pentagon says compulsory COVID injections coming.
[00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:45.178]  And then they admit, but we're waiting till it's FDA approved, which they'll probably never do because they got to keep it experimental and secret to cover up all the data.
[00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:48.590]  Wait, wait, wait!
[00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.771]  I thought it was approved!
[00:40:50.211 --> 00:40:50.932]  Safe and effective!
[00:40:50.952 --> 00:40:52.574]  I've heard that 85 trillion times!
[00:40:52.934 --> 00:40:54.976]  Here is the Pentagon Press Briefing.
[00:41:08.643 --> 00:41:09.824]  I want to get ahead of the FDA.
[00:41:10.484 --> 00:41:14.988]  Right now it's being used under emergency use authorization, which makes it a voluntary vaccine.
[00:41:15.448 --> 00:41:25.775]  Should the FDA approve it, then I am certain that Pentagon leadership will take a look at what our options are going forward, including the potential option of making mandatory.
[00:41:25.815 --> 00:41:28.497]  But I'm not going to get too far ahead of process right now.
[00:41:28.937 --> 00:41:32.260]  It is an FDA, it is not FDA approved, and therefore
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.380]  It is still a voluntary vaccine.
[00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:43.083]  I would like to add that as we speak, almost 69% of DoD personnel have received at least one dose.
[00:41:43.463 --> 00:41:44.323]  And a lot of them have died.
[00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:45.423]  Okay, so that's enough.
[00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:47.264]  So there you go.
[00:41:47.664 --> 00:41:49.564]  All over Twitter, all over Facebook, everywhere.
[00:41:49.584 --> 00:41:49.944]  I just see it.
[00:41:50.024 --> 00:41:51.025]  Alex Jones is lying.
[00:41:51.105 --> 00:41:51.725]  It's approved.
[00:41:52.065 --> 00:41:52.525]  It's safe.
[00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:53.405]  Nobody's getting hurt.
[00:41:54.086 --> 00:41:56.786]  Oh, nobody's getting hurt, huh?
[00:41:57.266 --> 00:41:59.327]  Young girl dies if we're taking vaccine.
[00:42:00.677 --> 00:42:03.521]  British rock star refuses to be part of government experiment.
[00:42:03.702 --> 00:42:07.147]  They call the public events now a government experiment site.
[00:42:07.347 --> 00:42:08.409]  And everyone's in an experiment.
[00:42:08.429 --> 00:42:09.991]  I'll cover that next hour.
[00:42:12.875 --> 00:42:22.907]  But all over the world, bars can now fully reopen if they ask for vaccine cards or negative COVID tests, making you be an indentured servant of the Hawaiian government, of the British government.
[00:42:22.927 --> 00:42:28.013]  This is all totally illegal with a digital ID to buy and sell.
[00:42:28.113 --> 00:42:29.214]  I mean, this is the mark of the beast.
[00:42:29.254 --> 00:42:30.375]  Total control.
[00:42:31.408 --> 00:42:33.069]  I'm going to get into these bills titled 666.
[00:42:33.289 --> 00:42:34.611]  One of them is already long.
[00:42:34.951 --> 00:42:38.373]  Wait till you hear about what's going to happen there coming up.
[00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:40.455]  And of course, lockdowns are being reinstated all over the world.
[00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:44.859]  We told you that would happen, and now Biden's considering new lockdowns, new hysteria, new lies.
[00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:47.981]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the next hour.
[00:42:48.341 --> 00:42:49.482]  I'm hoping the phone's up for calls.
[00:42:49.582 --> 00:42:51.904]  Michael Malice is going to be in studio, a really smart guy.
[00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:53.986]  Separately, don't forget,
[00:42:55.523 --> 00:42:57.325]  God gave us all the defenses we need in nature.
[00:42:57.665 --> 00:43:00.067]  The biggest thing people are deficient in is iodine.
[00:43:00.107 --> 00:43:04.372]  We have the purest, cleanest iodine for ingestion, both in a spray bottle and into your mouth.
[00:43:04.432 --> 00:43:05.973]  Very same stuff as X2, it's the same thing.
[00:43:06.474 --> 00:43:11.819]  That's 60% off, and then we have 40% off on the dropper bottle because, again, we've got
[00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.971]  More of that.
[00:43:14.271 --> 00:43:17.594]  But we're going to run out of the spray bottle and it's 60% off in probably four or five days.
[00:43:17.614 --> 00:43:18.855]  We're going to run out of the other about two weeks.
[00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:22.058]  But I'm going to sell it all out until it sells out because I want you to get it.
[00:43:22.118 --> 00:43:25.501]  But the free shipping and double Patriot points on it is going to end this weekend.
[00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:28.164]  But we are going to run out of X2 spray and
[00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:30.786]  We'll be back in hour number two.
[00:43:30.806 --> 00:43:30.946]  Humor
[00:43:57.333 --> 00:44:04.160]  is a natural defense mechanism of the body when times are bad to lighten up, and it's very important to do.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:10.706]  So as dark as times are and as serious as they are, hey, we know the Bible's real, we know the Antichrist is real, we know it all ends.
[00:44:11.126 --> 00:44:14.850]  So we've got to maintain positivity and not let the enemy get us down.
[00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:29.633]  But they are coming with the contact tracers, and I told you yesterday I would break down what this is going to look like, how this is going to unfold, but it takes some real mental stress to make me actually focus on this and say all this, and I'm not being dramatic, I'm serious.
[00:44:29.653 --> 00:44:40.074]  So I'm going to be a big boy, and I'm going to come back and tell you what I think they're going to do and what's going to unfold in the next few years, and it's really horrible, and I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, but the truth will set us free.
[00:44:40.435 --> 00:44:42.495]  Here's John Bowne's report that's an important prelude to this.
[00:44:43.527 --> 00:44:49.518]  We don't have major leaders in Canada saying they're using COVID to bring in martial law to silence dissent.
[00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:53.144]  They say it in national TV press conferences.
[00:44:53.765 --> 00:44:56.149]  They are going public with tyranny and now.
[00:44:57.216 --> 00:45:08.809]  Biden has launched the COVID tracking teams in the name of the Delta tracking teams, the Delta plus variant tracking teams coming door to door to harass the unvaccinated.
[00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:10.390]  This is the Iron Fist.
[00:45:10.611 --> 00:45:15.676]  I'm here to talk to you today about the Delta variant that causes COVID-19.
[00:45:20.269 --> 00:45:23.513]  Well, anyone who is not vaccinated is most at risk.
[00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:26.978]  Younger people are less likely to be vaccinated.
[00:45:27.398 --> 00:45:32.965]  That puts the entire cohort of younger people at greater risk.
[00:45:33.586 --> 00:45:35.789]  We need everyone to get vaccinated.
[00:45:37.517 --> 00:45:45.343]  If we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to celebrate Independence Day.
[00:45:46.063 --> 00:45:49.666]  That will make this Independence Day something truly special.
[00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:54.290]  When I got vaccinated, the first thing on my mind was, I can finally see my friends.
[00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.551]  And go out to dinner.
[00:45:55.611 --> 00:45:57.372]  We feel more comfortable taking our children out and about.
[00:45:57.772 --> 00:46:00.596]  We tend to use the word isolation for someone who is a case confirmed.
[00:46:13.653 --> 00:46:18.895]  We tend to use the word quarantine for someone who's at risk of being a case, usually a contact.
[00:46:19.436 --> 00:46:28.299]  So on that basis, we advise that all suspect cases are tested and all suspect cases are isolated in an appropriate medical facility.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:35.583]  In low incidence areas, where there are sporadic cases or clusters, we advise that all contacts should be quarantined.
[00:46:36.523 --> 00:46:40.965]  Ideally, that quarantine should occur in a place other than the home.
[00:46:41.245 --> 00:46:50.328]  They did that with community workers, with public health workers, visiting the houses, checking on people, checking their health status every day and saying, how are you?
[00:46:50.448 --> 00:46:51.248]  Have you got a fever?
[00:46:51.588 --> 00:46:52.368]  Have you got a cough?
[00:46:52.688 --> 00:46:56.950]  And if a contact has developed a cough or a fever, they were taken immediately for testing.
[00:46:58.277 --> 00:47:07.765]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:47:07.946 --> 00:47:10.288]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick these people are.
[00:47:10.908 --> 00:47:15.672]  Casting themselves as the heroes, the rest of us as the evil disease spreaders.
[00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:16.693]  And now...
[00:47:18.074 --> 00:47:23.821]  Biden and White House deployed Delta variant response teams across the U.S.
[00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.903]  to communities with low vaccination rates.
[00:47:26.764 --> 00:47:34.012]  They're going to force their way into homes and quote, force people to be tested with fraudulent machines that are 94% false positive.
[00:47:34.773 --> 00:47:37.095]  And it's far worse than that already in Europe, Canada.
[00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:43.462]  Places like Australia, where they have been arresting people for a year, that protest online!
[00:47:43.482 --> 00:47:46.064]  Now you're under arrest in relation to incitement.
[00:47:46.605 --> 00:47:47.425]  Incitement?
[00:47:47.626 --> 00:47:50.308]  A young mother, still in her pyjamas, is cuffed.
[00:47:50.608 --> 00:47:51.309]  What on earth?
[00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.691]  Excuse me, what on earth?
[00:47:53.972 --> 00:47:57.335]  Slapped with a search warrant in front of her partner and young children.
[00:47:57.355 --> 00:47:57.875]  What's this?
[00:47:58.016 --> 00:47:59.237]  Ultrasound in an hour?
[00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:00.458]  Yeah, she's pregnant.
[00:48:00.538 --> 00:48:11.763]  But Ballarat detectives were determined to question Zoe Bueller after the 28-year-old allegedly created this Freedom Day Facebook event, asking her friends to remember the 5th of September.
[00:48:11.783 --> 00:48:14.004]  I wasn't breaking any laws by doing that.
[00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:14.884]  You are actually.
[00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:15.664]  You are breaking laws.
[00:48:15.704 --> 00:48:16.985]  That's why I'm arresting you.
[00:48:17.145 --> 00:48:18.946]  In relation to... How can you arrest her?
[00:48:20.727 --> 00:48:32.993]  The former cleaner turned candle maker has posted that COVID is a hoax and police alleged she was behind an anti-lockdown demonstration similar to those planned in major cities across the world this Saturday.
[00:48:33.013 --> 00:48:35.994]  They also censored medical treatments, medical doctors.
[00:48:36.054 --> 00:48:45.499]  This is a giant exercise in raping our freedoms, raping our speech, raping our bodies and forcing their deadly gene therapies into us.
[00:48:46.374 --> 00:48:49.056]  I got mainstream news going, we don't know why they're doing that!
[00:48:49.396 --> 00:49:09.509]  I mean... Okay, so Prince Charles, Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and there's hundreds of these people that have been in the Wall Street Journal, in the New York Times, we've done countless reports on it, we've shown you the articles on air where they say, we're establishing a corporate system
[00:49:10.731 --> 00:49:17.114]  To help world government carry out an orderly, dignified depopulation because there's too many people.
[00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:24.637]  And granted, you go to some areas, it's squalor, they're poor, it's falling apart, poor people are having 10 kids, I don't like it, it's not good.
[00:49:25.257 --> 00:49:39.764]  But then you look at Bill Gates and the globalists, they're the most exploitive, evil, horrible people that promote all these other evil globalist agendas of sexualizing children and pedophilia and the destruction of the family.
[00:49:40.819 --> 00:49:53.865]  And you realize, this isn't the pop eugenics of, let's strengthen the race of humanity by promoting breeding of individuals with higher IQs or things like this.
[00:49:53.925 --> 00:49:55.146]  And of course, that leads to hell.
[00:49:55.486 --> 00:49:56.406]  We know where that goes.
[00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.407]  That's why it's been rejected by the general public.
[00:49:58.687 --> 00:49:59.788]  We had major wars over it.
[00:50:01.509 --> 00:50:02.389]  But now it's back.
[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.871]  And it's literally trying to sterilize our children.
[00:50:05.911 --> 00:50:08.172]  It's trying to force deadly things into our bodies.
[00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:13.262]  And so if we can put the headline up from today's show, it says it all right there.
[00:50:14.082 --> 00:50:22.488]  The globalists have triggered their planetary depopulation operation that they promised they were going to do.
[00:50:23.028 --> 00:50:27.191]  And so everybody's having this moment where they're going, wait a minute.
[00:50:28.853 --> 00:50:38.039]  I heard this from Alex Jones, and I heard this from countless other quote, crazy right-wingers in the last 40, 50 years.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.703]  And we never checked into it because that's just preposterous.
[00:50:42.723 --> 00:50:45.546]  That's not, you know, they're not putting fluoride in the water to lower our IQs.
[00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:50.471]  And then you get Obama's White House czar, John P. Holdren.
[00:50:52.176 --> 00:51:09.690]  Who co-wrote the big 1,100-page textbook, Ecoscience, published in 1974, that is a PhD-level book for the elites on how to carry out world government and depopulation and how inoculations and fluoride in the water will be used to lower fertility and IQ.
[00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:14.714]  I mean, they tell you what they're doing, and I guess their argument is,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.681]  That if you don't care while they're doing this, you deserve it.
[00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:26.364]  And I've told you, I've had off-record discussions with globalists at the next to the highest level.
[00:51:27.044 --> 00:51:31.606]  I mean, head of the Kissinger Group, you know, heads of other major institutions.
[00:51:32.146 --> 00:51:36.047]  And I only talk about the Kissinger Group because the guy did it on record, in front of my producer.
[00:51:37.188 --> 00:51:41.649]  And tried to get me to go to, you know, New York and be seduced by the CFR and the rest of it.
[00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.011]  The other times, it was even more bold.
[00:51:45.896 --> 00:51:46.337]  More bold.
[00:51:47.238 --> 00:51:57.509]  And most people get that speech and they bow down to it because they want the private jets and they want the money and they want the power and they want whatever, but they lose their humanity in the process.
[00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.274]  And they're very, very empty, unhappy people, in my experience.
[00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:02.035]  They don't have joy.
[00:52:02.095 --> 00:52:03.837]  They don't have real empowerment.
[00:52:03.877 --> 00:52:05.579]  And they're also not given discernment.
[00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:09.644]  So, this is the new world order takeover.
[00:52:09.684 --> 00:52:10.765]  This is the world ID.
[00:52:11.105 --> 00:52:12.525]  This is the implantable microchip.
[00:52:12.565 --> 00:52:13.425]  Klaus Schwab has said it.
[00:52:14.225 --> 00:52:16.286]  This is the banning small businesses.
[00:52:16.306 --> 00:52:22.007]  This is the persecuting and herding and attacking those that haven't been injected with this experimental garbage.
[00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:26.508]  This is the rollout, and you see the areas that accept it.
[00:52:26.648 --> 00:52:27.768]  The lockdown never ends.
[00:52:28.468 --> 00:52:29.868]  Oh, sorry, the shots don't work.
[00:52:29.908 --> 00:52:30.688]  Gotta take more.
[00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:33.369]  They've held everyone hostage.
[00:52:34.755 --> 00:52:39.296]  And it's all been directed by a handful of Fortune 100 companies and the United Nations.
[00:52:39.716 --> 00:52:41.817]  And they've been very successful suppressing treatments.
[00:52:42.197 --> 00:52:44.698]  They've been very successful suppressing the truth.
[00:52:44.998 --> 00:52:46.018]  They've been very successful.
[00:52:46.498 --> 00:52:54.261]  And all over the world, they are coming and arresting people who they say have tested positive for COVID and taking them to government facilities and disappearing them.
[00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:56.061]  This is footage out of Latin America.
[00:52:56.942 --> 00:53:00.803]  And now they're starting forced inoculations in Australia of school children and others.
[00:53:00.883 --> 00:53:01.483]  And it's illegal!
[00:53:02.756 --> 00:53:05.618]  But the government said, oh, it's for the good, shut up.
[00:53:06.399 --> 00:53:28.958]  So this is a revolution against your health privacy, a revolution against every bulwark, every speed hump, every impediment to absolute total tyranny by a group of self-appointed globalists that say they're doing this to save the earth, but really what they're doing is doing it to get total control over humanity and do whatever they want with us because they enjoy that power.
[00:53:30.936 --> 00:53:38.518]  And so now you hear, oh, in Bloomberg, and in BBC, and in AP, and hey, we should force people to take shots.
[00:53:39.578 --> 00:53:41.939]  And hey, children need to take it, they're little bug factories.
[00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:44.680]  And oh, you all gotta just keep wearing masks forever.
[00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:54.163]  Because they want to introduce this dystopia because the evil wants to promote pedophilia.
[00:53:54.623 --> 00:53:56.003]  They want access to children.
[00:53:56.763 --> 00:53:58.884]  That's what their spirit wants, to destroy innocence.
[00:54:00.936 --> 00:54:08.258]  And just like you might enjoy a veal chop because it tastes so tender and good, they spiritually see your children as a veal chop.
[00:54:08.998 --> 00:54:11.359]  And they know we're organizing against them.
[00:54:11.399 --> 00:54:13.099]  They know we were destroying their networks.
[00:54:13.379 --> 00:54:27.203]  They know we were bringing them down and getting patriots and Christian nationalists elected all over the world that see the spiritual colonialism of this New World Order rainbow flag transhumanist takeover.
[00:54:29.738 --> 00:54:32.259]  The human cloning that Congress wouldn't even ban.
[00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:34.099]  It's going on.
[00:54:34.139 --> 00:54:35.099]  The human-animal hybrids.
[00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:40.121]  It's all here, and they want a license to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:50.244]  And their microchip, just like Rockefeller told Aaron Russo when he was a big Hollywood producer making Eddie Murphy movies, he said, we're all going to have a chip that says, kiss my ass.
[00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:52.384]  I can go anywhere I want, do whatever I want.
[00:54:52.424 --> 00:54:53.345]  I'll be tax exempt.
[00:54:53.645 --> 00:54:54.545]  I'll be above the law.
[00:54:55.697 --> 00:54:58.118]  And now you see it with Hunter Biden and his dad and the rest of them.
[00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:01.821]  And now they're on TV saying, on 60 Minutes, we're going to put chips in all the troops.
[00:55:03.021 --> 00:55:05.162]  Folks, they were already putting chips in a lot of the military years ago.
[00:55:07.224 --> 00:55:08.484]  Now they want to put brain chips in them.
[00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.926]  Now they want to give you behavioral vaccines.
[00:55:10.946 --> 00:55:12.347]  That just means something you're injected with.
[00:55:12.967 --> 00:55:14.628]  You can call shoot and smile with a gun a vaccine.
[00:55:14.688 --> 00:55:15.789]  You're injecting lead into them.
[00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:19.771]  They're injecting systems that go in and reprogram your very cells.
[00:55:21.513 --> 00:55:27.778]  And most importantly, they're killing and maiming people and getting away with it to see what else you'll accept.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:38.227]  And so, they're going to start rolling out the contact tracers as they've already done it in Europe, as they've already done it in Australia, as they've already done it in Latin America, where they come to your door.
[00:55:40.401 --> 00:55:42.222]  And they say, your neighbor said you were coughing.
[00:55:42.642 --> 00:55:44.003]  We got a report you were sick.
[00:55:44.343 --> 00:55:44.923]  No, I'm fine.
[00:55:45.424 --> 00:55:45.964]  You don't have a warrant.
[00:55:45.984 --> 00:55:46.524]  Get out of my house.
[00:55:47.164 --> 00:55:49.326]  Well, under the emergency code, we don't need a warrant.
[00:55:49.426 --> 00:55:50.066]  Come outside.
[00:55:50.086 --> 00:55:53.428]  And they've got a little credit card reader machine.
[00:55:53.448 --> 00:55:54.568]  It's total fraud.
[00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:57.610]  They stick Lord knows what up your nose.
[00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:59.010]  They stick it in the machine.
[00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:01.652]  Two minutes later, it says they can turn up to 40 cycles.
[00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:03.653]  She'll be basically 100% false positive.
[00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:08.937]  And oh, sorry, because the computer will tell them, we're going to go at 40 cycles.
[00:56:08.957 --> 00:56:11.518]  If you're a good little globalist, they're going to come to your house and test you.
[00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:17.923]  And now they've got a perfect excuse to disappear you and get used to vans driving around, grabbing people.
[00:56:17.963 --> 00:56:26.108]  And all the Democrats and all the leftists that went to college in Europe and Latin America and Africa and Asia, everywhere, they go to these UN certified schools.
[00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:31.931]  To learn how to be social workers, to be in AmeriCorps, or to be in the Peace Corps.
[00:56:32.271 --> 00:56:37.333]  And now that's that civilian domestic army Obama talked about, just as big, just as strong as the military.
[00:56:37.693 --> 00:56:39.814]  And it's not there to take your guns right away.
[00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:41.954]  It's not there to, no, no, it's there to save you.
[00:56:42.374 --> 00:56:44.035]  It's there to make sure you take the shot.
[00:56:44.075 --> 00:56:47.796]  It's there to see if you're sick and go in your home and take you out and take you away.
[00:56:48.116 --> 00:56:50.577]  And sure, that was all in the UN plans years ago.
[00:56:51.098 --> 00:56:53.498]  It was in the Rockefeller plan, lockstep, 11 years ago.
[00:56:54.059 --> 00:56:54.459]  But now?
[00:56:55.479 --> 00:56:57.440]  Now it's operational, you see.
[00:56:58.261 --> 00:57:01.803]  And so, Biden last week said in a press conference, yeah, we're going to go to Republican areas.
[00:57:02.303 --> 00:57:03.384]  They're making this political.
[00:57:04.044 --> 00:57:05.065]  This is not political.
[00:57:05.225 --> 00:57:06.285]  Of course, it's totally political.
[00:57:06.666 --> 00:57:08.006]  And so we're going to areas.
[00:57:08.047 --> 00:57:08.927]  We have the zip codes.
[00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:10.268]  We know who's not been given shots.
[00:57:10.328 --> 00:57:13.009]  And the Health and Human Services Secretary said, I've got the clip.
[00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.710]  We'll play it next segment.
[00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:16.512]  We've got a database of who's had the shot and who hadn't.
[00:57:16.552 --> 00:57:19.133]  And we've integrated it in with the Census Bureau.
[00:57:20.014 --> 00:57:22.175]  And we're coming to your house because we know you didn't have it.
[00:57:23.956 --> 00:57:26.059]  I mean, this is government contact with you.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:30.385]  And now, oh, it's a law enforcement legislation.
[00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:31.367]  We'll cover that next segment.
[00:57:31.607 --> 00:57:32.628]  Oh, and why not?
[00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:34.531]  Two billion dollars for capital security.
[00:57:35.072 --> 00:57:36.554]  Two billion additional dollars.
[00:57:37.195 --> 00:57:39.798]  Oh, you know what we're going to do now?
[00:57:41.254 --> 00:57:52.558]  We're going to set up in all 50 states, starting in Florida and California, this new legislative police force that goes out and goes after people that are criticizing members of Congress or anybody else.
[00:57:53.158 --> 00:57:57.040]  And any criticism they're saying is radicalization and it's terrorism.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:02.522]  So they're creating a new domestic anti-terror force that literally works for the Democrats and has all been announced.
[00:58:03.602 --> 00:58:05.183]  See, we went off the edge of a cliff.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.601]  We're free-falling now.
[00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:11.823]  And lying about it to yourselves isn't going to make it any better.
[00:58:13.124 --> 00:58:15.906]  Admitting what's happening and organizing against it is.
[00:58:16.006 --> 00:58:20.128]  I'm going to explain this when we come back, but this is the heart of everything.
[00:58:20.148 --> 00:58:22.330]  I'm going to cover it on the other side of this quick break.
[00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.211]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:58:25.392 --> 00:58:26.212]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:58:27.613 --> 00:58:30.735]  So, we are now under UN global control.
[00:58:30.795 --> 00:58:34.037]  The corporations that financed and created the UN, the Rockefeller system,
[00:58:35.672 --> 00:58:39.974]  And it is designed to bring in planetary world government, transhumanism, and depopulation.
[00:58:41.055 --> 00:58:52.741]  And it needs a pretext to arrest people, disappear people, forcibly test people, put out our medical records, share it on giant databases, make you give your medical records to people at restaurants or at baseball games.
[00:58:54.361 --> 00:58:56.562]  And they're saying, hey, we want to make it mandatory.
[00:58:57.003 --> 00:58:59.324]  Remember, oh, it'll never be mandatory to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:59:00.899 --> 00:59:06.982]  And of course, it was always planned to be mandatory, so that we wouldn't form opposition and say, hey, we don't want mandatory.
[00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:09.783]  Or, hey, your vaccine doesn't even work.
[00:59:09.943 --> 00:59:10.844]  I told you it wouldn't work.
[00:59:11.304 --> 00:59:13.505]  They call every cold COVID.
[00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:21.969]  You can't make a vaccine for all the cold viruses, unless you make it for the protein, which is in your body, which then you get attacked.
[00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:24.090]  I mean, this is show 101.
[00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:25.251]  They knew what they did.
[00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:27.652]  They did it by design.
[00:59:29.461 --> 00:59:35.825]  And it's just such a giant crime and it's so naked, it's so out in the open that I personally am completely blown away.
[00:59:35.885 --> 00:59:57.857]  I mean, I knew it was coming, I knew they said they'd do it, I know they've been caught doing thousands of illegal tests, lethal tests on poor people all over the world, but now they hit the industrialized world with a depopulation weapon, which will then bankrupt everybody as they slowly die, which will then funnel all your money through the medical system back to the globalists.
[00:59:58.922 --> 01:00:03.906]  So it's all about control, all about centralizing the economy, making you obsolete, non-essential.
[01:00:04.127 --> 01:00:05.468]  They've told you you're non-essential.
[01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:09.772]  Like in the science fiction movie, The Aliens Land, they say, you are obsolete.
[01:00:10.192 --> 01:00:11.533]  You will be eliminated.
[01:00:11.793 --> 01:00:17.178]  But they're telling you this like they're there to save you while they tell you you're obsolete.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.282]  So they're announcing just, oh, $2 billion.
[01:00:23.717 --> 01:00:25.058]  Statutorily, it's illegal.
[01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:27.020]  Federal law says D.C.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.461]  police can't be outside D.C.
[01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:29.621]  We don't care.
[01:00:29.882 --> 01:00:30.842]  We're just doing it.
[01:00:31.983 --> 01:00:38.148]  We don't care it's illegal to open the borders up and let people smuggle kids in with no IDs and just give them to whoever they want, but they're doing it.
[01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:45.533]  It's illegal to do this on every single front, but they're just doing it.
[01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:48.596]  So of course they're setting up with $2 billion of your money.
[01:00:49.403 --> 01:00:50.344]  Capitol Police.
[01:00:50.444 --> 01:00:51.004]  Oh, who's that?
[01:00:51.124 --> 01:00:52.405]  Oh, that's the Capitol Police!
[01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:54.246]  Here in the middle of Kansas.
[01:00:54.447 --> 01:00:56.208]  Oh, who pulled me over?
[01:00:56.328 --> 01:00:57.909]  Oh, I'm the Federal Police.
[01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:00.651]  The Federal Police Force.
[01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.214]  All tentacles of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[01:01:07.436 --> 01:01:07.696]  And what?
[01:01:07.716 --> 01:01:09.837]  They just busted another FBI agent being a pedophile?
[01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:10.538]  Like yesterday?
[01:01:10.558 --> 01:01:11.719]  It's like every couple days now?
[01:01:13.444 --> 01:01:15.265]  And it's not that FBI agents are pedophiles.
[01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:18.186]  It's that pedophiles are taking everything over!
[01:01:18.607 --> 01:01:19.247]  It's a cult!
[01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:21.768]  We're going to get your kids.
[01:01:21.788 --> 01:01:22.629]  We're going to corrupt them.
[01:01:23.009 --> 01:01:24.330]  We're going to get them no matter what you do.
[01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.510]  We're coming for your children.
[01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.971]  Hey, don't come for my children.
[01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:28.992]  Oh, you're threatening us.
[01:01:29.032 --> 01:01:29.852]  We're victims.
[01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.474]  We're just a bunch of men that want your children.
[01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:34.315]  Not any problem.
[01:01:34.355 --> 01:01:35.595]  Our flags are just everywhere.
[01:01:36.436 --> 01:01:38.337]  We're just forcing it on you everywhere.
[01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:42.112]  So here it is, the H.R.
[01:01:43.273 --> 01:01:46.715]  666 Anti-Racism in Public Health Act.
[01:01:46.935 --> 01:01:48.716]  Oh my gosh, well I'm up for racism then.
[01:01:51.041 --> 01:02:09.704]  And it says here, conduct, analyze data, and administer research and grant program to address racism and the impact of health and well-being with all of your medical records from the CDC, the National Center for Anti-Racism, that's run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, with your medical records.
[01:02:10.285 --> 01:02:14.707]  So, the FBI, the Justice Department, the ADL, the Southern Primary Law Center, they've already got all your records.
[01:02:14.727 --> 01:02:18.249]  They're already in all your iPhone apps and in your Twitter and Facebook.
[01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:20.210]  They're the moderators that read your private messages.
[01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:21.211]  You can trust them.
[01:02:21.611 --> 01:02:28.615]  Same folks that can listen in over the little digital assistants from Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon.
[01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:40.246]  The bill establishes within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a National Center for Anti-Racism and Health and a Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program.
[01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:47.252]  Among other activities, the new center must declare racism a public health issue, collect and analyze data.
[01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:49.354]  Oh, they get your medical records.
[01:02:49.794 --> 01:02:55.304]  And administer research and grant programs to address racism and the impact of health and well-being.
[01:02:55.384 --> 01:03:00.533]  Because the health department was set up in New York first by Margaret Sanger to quote, exterminate black weeds.
[01:03:00.894 --> 01:03:02.136]  But now they really love you.
[01:03:03.126 --> 01:03:25.634]  Additionally, the bill specifically directs the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in coordination with the Department of Justice and other relevant stakeholders to carry out the Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program by conducting research and supporting officer and other activities pertaining to law enforcement, violence, and public health.
[01:03:26.015 --> 01:03:32.237]  So, Contact Tracers, your medical records with the ADL, with the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:43.378]  With Health and Human Services, interfacing your local health department, seamless surveillance control, legalizing the surveillance state they've already had for decades that's so illegal.
[01:03:45.379 --> 01:03:46.699]  They've committed all these crimes.
[01:03:46.759 --> 01:03:47.960]  They're pedophiles, folks.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.461]  And they know it's all coming out.
[01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:54.043]  And so now they're just rushing to legalize it all, hoping that they don't all go to prison.
[01:03:55.882 --> 01:03:58.665]  And now that, of course, is House Resolution 666.
[01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:00.667]  Oh, here's another one!
[01:04:00.827 --> 01:04:02.109]  H.R.
[01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:02.109]  6666!
[01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.971]  This became law!
[01:04:04.311 --> 01:04:04.872]  COVID-19 testing!
[01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:11.797]  Reaching and Contacting Everyone Trace Act.
[01:04:12.298 --> 01:04:13.018]  And what do they call it?
[01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:20.401]  They call it, what does Saki, Jen Saki, again not a bad drink, a bad person, what does she call it?
[01:04:20.861 --> 01:04:21.901]  Strike forces!
[01:04:22.062 --> 01:04:22.482]  Strike!
[01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:24.142]  Strike forces!
[01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:28.684]  And I play you the clips, they're like, oh, we're gonna hunt you down if you haven't had your shots.
[01:04:29.304 --> 01:04:34.887]  In England, in Australia, in New Zealand, the billboards are, we're hunting you down, we're the Tracers.
[01:04:35.447 --> 01:04:37.648]  And all the college kids that went to be
[01:04:39.195 --> 01:04:44.299]  Bureaucrats who went to be social workers, they're now told, oh, the new job is contact tracer.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:51.405]  Texas gave, what was it, $600 million to Google so they can run it and run the database and then send people to your house.
[01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:58.471]  Oh, and Biden said last week, Republicans, because you're the bad people, you're the ones who will take the shot, making it political.
[01:04:59.383 --> 01:05:01.245]  And then they come, and here they are.
[01:05:02.086 --> 01:05:03.868]  Oh, the database that they know all about you.
[01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:05.810]  Whatever happened to warrants?
[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.291]  Oh, well, that's just the way it is now.
[01:05:07.632 --> 01:05:09.053]  And Tucker Carlson did a great job last time.
[01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.335]  He got into eugenics of this.
[01:05:10.775 --> 01:05:15.300]  Now, this is all eugenics laws through the health departments, and the media's like, oh my God, he's totally Alex Jones!
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.702]  Well, he reads laws on air from...
[01:05:19.653 --> 01:05:23.495]  1900, 1910, 1919.
[01:05:21.413 --> 01:05:23.495]  You know, he's reading the same damn law.
[01:05:23.915 --> 01:05:26.276]  He reads the same Supreme Court rulings about all this.
[01:05:26.877 --> 01:05:27.577]  It's still on the books.
[01:05:27.597 --> 01:05:31.899]  The Supreme Court says they can come grab your daughter or your son and chop their balls off.
[01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:32.860]  No judge, no jury.
[01:05:34.332 --> 01:05:49.518]  You know, some of the books with the health departments in places like Maine and New York and Washington State that they can grab a woman or a man at any age and remove their uterus, their ovaries, their fallopian tubes, or their testicles.
[01:05:50.378 --> 01:05:54.101]  And then Tucker Carlson read that on air and he's like Alex Jones now!
[01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:56.742]  Because it's true!
[01:05:57.123 --> 01:05:59.024]  That's who these people are!
[01:05:59.304 --> 01:06:00.845]  And that's what's going on!
[01:06:01.385 --> 01:06:04.327]  And the bills are 666 to piss in our face!
[01:06:05.408 --> 01:06:07.809]  And we're coming for your children and we're gonna corrupt them!
[01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.571]  We're gonna have sex with them!
[01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:11.172]  But we're not pedophiles!
[01:06:12.591 --> 01:06:15.373]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[01:06:15.753 --> 01:06:17.954]  Margaret Sanger said, kill the blacks, they're weeds.
[01:06:18.655 --> 01:06:20.816]  The left will edit me saying that and say I said that.
[01:06:21.496 --> 01:06:28.480]  I said the Uyghurs are being killed on a talk show and said that black people should care about everybody, and they said I was calling them the N-word.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.122]  That's how they use ignorance to control people!
[01:06:32.017 --> 01:06:35.040]  All right, Michael Malice is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.402]  Quite the iconoclast, really smart guy.
[01:06:37.422 --> 01:06:40.465]  This podcast just gets more and more popular all the time.
[01:06:40.485 --> 01:06:43.227]  I had a chance to be on it when I was up in New York a few weeks ago.
[01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.569]  They just dropped yesterday.
[01:06:45.896 --> 01:06:46.677]  He'll be in studio with us.
[01:06:46.697 --> 01:06:48.358]  He's also wrote a book on North Korea.
[01:06:48.558 --> 01:06:49.298]  Spent a lot of time there.
[01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.760]  He's childhood friends with Kim Jong-un.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:52.721]  That's a joke!
[01:06:53.421 --> 01:06:55.702]  That is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:56.203 --> 01:06:58.584]  Oh, I forgot to get to all the 666 bills.
[01:06:58.624 --> 01:06:58.905]  Sorry.
[01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.566]  There's so many dealing with the globalist takeover.
[01:07:02.067 --> 01:07:09.291]  HR 666, give all your medical records to the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and merge the Justice Department over contact tracing.
[01:07:09.612 --> 01:07:12.173]  We have SWAT team power to the bureaucrats.
[01:07:12.374 --> 01:07:12.814]  There's that.
[01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:23.855]  And then there's the HR 6666, COVID-19 testing, reaching and contacting everyone at 6666, coming in your house without warrants.
[01:07:24.215 --> 01:07:30.778]  And then of course you got Bill Gates' patent, W0202060606.
[01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:42.183]  For tracking you with AI and then turning that into a cryptocurrency to pay you if you robotically follow orders the way you're supposed to.
[01:07:42.203 --> 01:07:42.924]  And then it continues.
[01:07:44.222 --> 01:07:49.564]  100 more cops dispatched to Sydney to enforce a new lockdown, inspired by the Delta variant!
[01:07:49.624 --> 01:07:51.445]  Oh my gosh, a new variant!
[01:07:51.605 --> 01:07:52.806]  Oh, we're so scared!
[01:07:54.787 --> 01:07:55.047]  Just...
[01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:02.001]  Twenty-five under-18s died from COVID in England.
[01:08:02.081 --> 01:08:04.362]  And of course, most of those died in car accidents, lots of them died of COVID.
[01:08:04.683 --> 01:08:06.203]  Hundreds died from suicide and trauma.
[01:08:06.603 --> 01:08:07.704]  That was the plan.
[01:08:07.764 --> 01:08:09.385]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:17.309]  Rand Paul says he will introduce a bill to scrap mask mandate, pointing out it's a farce and doesn't protect you and gives you bacterial pneumonia.
[01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:21.090]  Fauci even authored a paper on that, peer-reviewed in 2008.
[01:08:23.472 --> 01:08:26.273]  But the cult loves seeing you like a slave.
[01:08:27.915 --> 01:08:30.836]  Camilla can't wait to get rid of face masks.
[01:08:33.117 --> 01:08:35.458]  That's the wife of Prince Charles.
[01:08:36.898 --> 01:08:42.040]  Sponsors abandoned Tokyo Olympics as spectators officially banned from the events.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:52.363]  Just all showing you the alien-ness of this, of humans bad, can't be next to humans, humans must be alone, humans must be locked up, humans are dirty, humans are... It's all a lie!
[01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:54.464]  The more people you're around, the healthier you are!
[01:08:56.035 --> 01:08:58.638]  People that are locked up and aren't around people are the ones that die and get sick.
[01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:03.465]  And the studies all show people locked up in their houses are the ones that died, including old people, from depression!
[01:09:03.485 --> 01:09:06.048]  Because your body says, I have no reason to be alive!
[01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.552]  Ever heard of cabin fever?
[01:09:09.553 --> 01:09:13.598]  Olympics will ban spectators after Japan declares state of emergency!
[01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.673]  And it goes on and on.
[01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:32.552]  FDA and CDC reassure Americans that third COVID jab is not needed yet, as Pfizer seeks to request emergency approval for booster shot for all of the hypochondriacs that want to go out and get more, more, more, even though they're chasing the devil here and finding their doom.
[01:09:35.737 --> 01:09:36.999]  Oh, but another fake poll.
[01:09:37.019 --> 01:09:40.182]  40% of Brits want mask mandates in place forever.
[01:09:40.663 --> 01:09:41.424]  Unvaccinated.
[01:09:41.484 --> 01:09:43.586]  Permanently banned from foreign travel.
[01:09:43.807 --> 01:09:44.948]  Hell, just kill them, huh?
[01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:46.650]  Just get rid of them all together.
[01:09:50.074 --> 01:09:52.517]  A lot of amazing, amazing information.
[01:09:52.777 --> 01:09:55.801]  I'm going to play a really important piece.
[01:09:58.148 --> 01:09:59.088]  We're Tucker Carlson.
[01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:04.191]  Last night got into eugenics and the whole history of this and the Supreme Court and how serious all this tyranny is.
[01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:10.794]  But just remember, only way we reach new people is you telling friends, family, neighbors, acquaintances, total strangers about the show.
[01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:17.438]  Freeworldnews.tv, write it on the back of a card, give it to folks and tell them here is the suppressed truth they don't want you to see.
[01:10:18.775 --> 01:10:21.537]  At the same time, please remember, we're listed for support.
[01:10:21.557 --> 01:10:25.380]  So buy a book, buy a film, buy a t-shirt, buy a water filtration system.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.480]  We have the highest rated out there.
[01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:28.242]  It's so important to do that.
[01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:32.865]  Water filters are 10% off right now, and that's a big discount because there's not much profit in those.
[01:10:33.245 --> 01:10:34.186]  They're already very competitive.
[01:10:34.386 --> 01:10:36.648]  And then we have free shipping this weekend, double patriot points.
[01:10:36.748 --> 01:10:42.011]  And X2 is selling out the good halogen, pure iodine, deep earth crystal, but I want you to experience it.
[01:10:42.232 --> 01:10:44.213]  So it's 40% off for the dropper bottle.
[01:10:44.613 --> 01:10:44.953]  It is
[01:10:45.914 --> 01:10:49.895]  Um, 60% off of the spray bottle that's the exact same high-quality deep-earth iodine.
[01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:51.095]  That is a great deal on that.
[01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:52.595]  Those are both selling out.
[01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.896]  Just like I told you, X3 now is off sale because it's about to sell out.
[01:10:55.956 --> 01:10:57.156]  Well, these are still on sale.
[01:10:57.176 --> 01:10:57.716]  They're excellent.
[01:10:58.076 --> 01:11:05.157]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139 and you keep the tip of the spear on the air, which is all of us together.
[01:11:05.497 --> 01:11:10.198]  Here is Tucker Carlson knocking it out of the park last night off historical documents.
[01:11:10.258 --> 01:11:10.678]  Here it is.
[01:11:11.598 --> 01:11:14.899]  Tony Fauci has declared them merely a political statement.
[01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:20.500]  It's easy to get, it's free, and it's readily available.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.262]  So, you know, you've got to ask, what is the problem?
[01:11:24.723 --> 01:11:25.423]  Get over it.
[01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:27.565]  Get over this political statement.
[01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:28.726]  Just get over it.
[01:11:29.926 --> 01:11:30.487]  Get over it?
[01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:32.208]  You don't have a right to disagree.
[01:11:32.248 --> 01:11:33.389]  You must take this medicine.
[01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:38.118]  This is a well-trod road that we're on, and it's a scary one.
[01:11:38.158 --> 01:11:40.478]  We've seen this before, more than a century ago.
[01:11:41.238 --> 01:11:48.480]  In the early 1900s, officials in Boston, of course, decided to make an example of a Swedish-born pastor called Henning Jacobsen.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.841]  Jacobsen refused to take the government-mandated smallpox vaccine, and in his case, he had good reason for refusing.
[01:11:55.121 --> 01:11:59.882]  He'd already taken that vaccine, the same vaccine, in Sweden as a child, and he nearly died from it.
[01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:06.560]  Jacobson fought the mandate, he took his case all the way to the Supreme Court, and in the end, the Supreme Court ruled against him.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.422]  That was a brand new precedent, then as now.
[01:12:10.563 --> 01:12:18.688]  And it didn't take long for the government to use that new authority, granted by the court, to force other medical procedures on the American population.
[01:12:19.409 --> 01:12:28.835]  After the Jacobson decision, the state of Virginia passed a law authorizing the involuntary sterilization of people that the state deemed to be, quote, feeble-minded, or mentally ill, undesirable.
[01:12:29.816 --> 01:12:43.541]  In a landmark decision, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, whom we revere most of the time, ruled that the same legal framework that justified mandatory vaccination also permitted the government to sterilize people against their will.
[01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:45.622]  He was explicit about the connection.
[01:12:45.702 --> 01:12:46.222]  Here's the quote.
[01:12:46.242 --> 01:12:47.183]  Holmes wrote.
[01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:59.735]  By 1930, dozens of American states were forcing women to undergo involuntary sterilization.
[01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:05.740]  And in the end, more than 60,000 American women were sterilized by the government against their will.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.582]  That happened, famously.
[01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.503]  And we shouldn't be surprised by it.
[01:13:11.023 --> 01:13:18.489]  Things like that tend to happen when a distracted, submissive population allows the government to dictate what medical procedures they get, what drugs they take.
[01:13:19.755 --> 01:13:26.002]  This is a well-known and horrifying chapter in American history, so you'd think the news media might point this out.
[01:13:26.883 --> 01:13:27.764]  But just the opposite.
[01:13:28.425 --> 01:13:35.474]  Here's a clip from yesterday in which the saddest of the CNN anchors begs this administration to make vaccines mandatory.
[01:13:36.937 --> 01:13:40.400]  What about Kathleen Sebelius, former secretary at HHS?
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:52.090]  Because she talks about the idea that maybe the administration shouldn't completely abandon the idea of not, if not vaccine mandates, at least encouraging some businesses or public places to require them.
[01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:55.152]  She says, quote, I'm trying to restrain myself, but I kind of had it.
[01:13:55.192 --> 01:13:57.354]  You know, we're going to tiptoe around mandates.
[01:13:57.394 --> 01:13:59.196]  It's like, come on, I'm kind of over that.
[01:13:59.316 --> 01:14:03.859]  I want to make sure that people I deal with don't have it, so I don't transmit it to my granddaughter.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:12.947]  So, why not encourage, if not governments to mandate it, then some businesses at least to require it?
[01:14:14.289 --> 01:14:17.251]  The media demanding forced vaccinations.
[01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:18.552]  That shouldn't surprise you.
[01:14:18.873 --> 01:14:21.035]  They're not in the business to inform the public.
[01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.396]  They're in the business for power.
[01:14:22.616 --> 01:14:26.319]  They couldn't get jobs in finance, but this gives them a little swat.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.842]  That's literally why they have the jobs they do.
[01:14:29.242 --> 01:14:30.263]  And they love their new power.
[01:14:31.837 --> 01:14:38.825]  What's interesting is that no other organized groups of sensible people who aren't emotionally damaged like your average cable news anchor.
[01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:41.198]  None of them are saying anything either.
[01:14:41.598 --> 01:14:41.939]  Why not?
[01:14:42.119 --> 01:14:48.003]  Veterans groups, for example, have remained silent as the Pentagon floats the idea of mandatory vaccinations for all soldiers.
[01:14:48.723 --> 01:14:56.248]  Now, there's zero scientific evidence that this could be necessary for any health-related reason whatsoever, but they're pushing forward.
[01:14:56.268 --> 01:15:03.033]  At a briefing on Tuesday, the Pentagon's top spokesman said that mandatory vaccinations for soldiers could be coming very soon.
[01:15:04.597 --> 01:15:14.910]  Should the FDA approve it, then I am certain that Pentagon leadership will take a look at what our options are going forward, including the potential option of making mandatory.
[01:15:16.753 --> 01:15:17.874]  Oh, making it mandatory.
[01:15:17.894 --> 01:15:19.154]  Have you seen this movie before?
[01:15:19.495 --> 01:15:19.875]  Yes.
[01:15:20.135 --> 01:15:23.157]  Those of us who are older than 22 remember it well.
[01:15:23.197 --> 01:15:28.160]  The Pentagon has forced soldiers to take untested experimental vaccines before it happened in Iraq.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.021]  Troops there had to take the anthrax vaccine.
[01:15:31.441 --> 01:15:32.042]  What happened?
[01:15:32.522 --> 01:15:35.824]  Many of those soldiers are now eligible for disability benefits through the VA.
[01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:36.324]  Look it up.
[01:15:36.744 --> 01:15:37.025]  Why?
[01:15:37.105 --> 01:15:40.146]  Because that vaccine caused serious long-term complications.
[01:15:40.567 --> 01:15:44.729]  Those included infertility, lupus, paralysis, blindness, neurological damage.
[01:15:46.448 --> 01:15:49.551]  Michael Malice is coming up on the other side.
[01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:51.594]  He is in studio with us.
[01:15:51.774 --> 01:15:52.775]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:53.035 --> 01:15:54.157]  Do not spread this link.
[01:15:54.197 --> 01:15:55.498]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.840]  Freeworldnews.tv.
[01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:03.988]  Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Malice, best-selling author, hit podcaster, and more.
[01:16:06.156 --> 01:16:08.477]  He does a lot of stuff, is in studio with us.
[01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:24.486]  Of course, he's been on the show for six, seven, eight years, but also he did two hit number one shows, number one, number two for Tim Pool on his great broadcast, the great Tim Pool, and his Forrest Redoubt, michaelmalice.com, Twitter, Michael Malice, and it is good to have you here with us in Austin.
[01:16:24.886 --> 01:16:27.168]  Alex, it is such a pleasure to be here.
[01:16:27.921 --> 01:16:30.242]  It's exciting to have you and your girlfriend and crew here.
[01:16:30.262 --> 01:16:31.003]  We're going out to dinner tonight.
[01:16:31.563 --> 01:16:34.484]  You just watched part of that Tucker piece, and you said, I want to talk about eugenics.
[01:16:34.785 --> 01:16:34.985]  Yeah.
[01:16:35.005 --> 01:16:42.909]  We can talk about a lot of stuff, but you want to talk about libertarianism, the police, the forced inoculations, where you see society going, the exodus out of New York, you're moving here.
[01:16:42.929 --> 01:16:43.849]  Is that a secret?
[01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:44.670]  No, it's not a secret.
[01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:45.010]  Not anymore.
[01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:48.372]  And all of that going on, but you want to talk about eugenics first.
[01:16:48.392 --> 01:16:49.212]  Well, it's great to have you, my friend.
[01:16:49.372 --> 01:16:50.513]  Well, it's great to be here.
[01:16:50.613 --> 01:16:59.596]  One of the things I like to do is buy historical books because a lot of times what we are perceiving right now to be fact has been distorted through years of history.
[01:17:00.057 --> 01:17:02.978]  So not that long ago I bought a book called The Case for Sterilization.
[01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.138]  It was a pro-eugenics book.
[01:17:04.198 --> 01:17:06.459]  It was written in the 1930s, I believe.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.321]  And I thought, alright, let's give these people the benefit of the doubt.
[01:17:09.341 --> 01:17:10.301]  You can download the internet.
[01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:11.101]  It's public domain.
[01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:11.882]  Page one.
[01:17:12.702 --> 01:17:13.162]  Page one.
[01:17:13.182 --> 01:17:14.102]  This is an American book.
[01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:29.607]  They say, while we don't agree with everything Hitler's doing, so the correlation between this, what you were talking about, you know, the early progressives in the early 20th century and later on, it was really did in many ways lead to Nazism and just horrific things.
[01:17:29.847 --> 01:17:39.271]  And speaking of New York, you have a I, sort of I love New York, I-357 Magnum snub-nosed revolver New York, meaning I want to kill New York, I want to flee New York, I hate New York.
[01:17:40.151 --> 01:17:48.095]  I don't even know, I'm such a New Yorker, I don't even know what guns are, so this is just like, I think it's more like the crime rates in New York that, you know... Well, I love that shirt!
[01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:48.815]  Well, thank you!
[01:17:49.695 --> 01:17:50.436]  Uh, I love it too!
[01:17:50.456 --> 01:17:51.716]  I thought it'd be appropriate to wear.
[01:17:51.857 --> 01:17:57.340]  And I actually, I'm very, I love New York and I'm very, very saddened by what has happened to the city.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.440]  I've lived there all my life.
[01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:00.181]  I don't know how to drive a car.
[01:18:01.022 --> 01:18:02.023]  And I... I didn't mean to interrupt.
[01:18:02.043 --> 01:18:02.943]  We'll get to that next segment.
[01:18:02.983 --> 01:18:05.825]  But the point is, you are a historian.
[01:18:05.865 --> 01:18:06.425]  I know a lot of history.
[01:18:06.445 --> 01:18:07.726]  You know more than I do because I've talked to you a lot.
[01:18:08.026 --> 01:18:08.967]  I'm a big admirer of your show.
[01:18:08.987 --> 01:18:09.607]  I watch all the time.
[01:18:10.147 --> 01:18:10.948]  I learn a lot of stuff from you.
[01:18:11.408 --> 01:18:16.834]  But people don't know, the center of eugenics was London at first, then New York, then Berlin, Germany.
[01:18:17.095 --> 01:18:20.839]  So when you talk about progressives and eugenics, I mean, this is where Hitler got it.
[01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:21.300]  Explain that.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.982]  Yeah, that's absolutely accurate.
[01:18:23.022 --> 01:18:28.949]  This was the idea in the early 20th century, late 19th century, that using science, right, and the science is settled.
[01:18:29.469 --> 01:18:34.270]  If we scientifically engineer a society, we can breed a better race.
[01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:41.272]  Now, Margaret Sanger often gets a bad rap because she talks about improving the race and people think it's a racist thing, meaning whites versus black.
[01:18:41.572 --> 01:18:42.712]  She means the human race.
[01:18:43.012 --> 01:18:50.334]  But they really had this idea that either voluntarily or through government, you could sit down and pick, this is a quality person.
[01:18:50.854 --> 01:18:51.715]  Which is not going to be us.
[01:18:52.155 --> 01:18:57.659]  And this is a bad quality person and they're going to breed and that way human beings are going to improve that way.
[01:18:58.039 --> 01:19:02.563]  And you can see how it would kind of make sense in one very basic way at the time.
[01:19:02.943 --> 01:19:10.568]  But the consequences of when you're picking who can have kids, and it's not like people that you and I would agree with, okay, this person's an unfit mother.
[01:19:10.929 --> 01:19:13.791]  It's really like people who are like politically undesirable.
[01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:16.633]  Maybe people have some kind of disease or illness.
[01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:31.897]  The number of kids that we have that need, you know, loving parents is just a complete... Oh, there's definitely a real problem, but who makes these people be in charge of the solution when it turns out, I've seen documentaries on the whole eugenics movement, most of them ended up in mental institutions and stuff.
[01:19:32.197 --> 01:19:34.998]  They were crazy control freaks, some of the worst people.
[01:19:36.058 --> 01:19:36.298]  Yes.
[01:19:36.518 --> 01:19:40.039]  Again, you can't make one group in charge just like communism.
[01:19:40.059 --> 01:19:41.979]  It doesn't work.
[01:19:42.699 --> 01:19:48.101]  It is literally communism because the communist idea, you know, another word for communism at the time was scientific socialism, right?
[01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:51.081]  So they were saying if you have freedom, freedom means chaos.
[01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:52.062]  No one's in charge.
[01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:53.022]  Everyone does what they want.
[01:19:53.042 --> 01:19:54.502]  You're going to have disastrous consequences.
[01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:58.583]  You and I are obviously both people who are supporters of the First Amendment, the concept behind it.
[01:19:58.863 --> 01:19:59.985]  And that chaos innovates.
[01:20:00.025 --> 01:20:00.986]  That chaos is beautiful.
[01:20:01.206 --> 01:20:03.950]  Right, because sometimes when you have freedom, people are going to say things you don't like.
[01:20:04.251 --> 01:20:06.233]  And you've got to nut up or deal with it or not.
[01:20:06.574 --> 01:20:08.697]  The same thing with kind of every other aspect.
[01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:10.900]  So they're saying, all right, we're going to decide.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.044]  And the thing is, what happens when you have governments in charge of this?
[01:20:14.705 --> 01:20:23.612]  And you have this in low-key ways in like North Korea and these other places where people are encouraged to breed if they're of a certain class and they're discouraged in another class.
[01:20:23.872 --> 01:20:26.574]  If you take one population, you can do this kind of in a shorthand way.
[01:20:26.835 --> 01:20:38.664]  If I take this group which I like and I make sure that they have food and this group that I don't like, I starve them, well that's a kind of a backdoor eugenics way because I'm encouraging this group to reproduce because they have the calories and these are not going to have kids.
[01:20:38.704 --> 01:20:39.685]  The kids are going to starve to death.
[01:20:40.285 --> 01:20:56.380]  I don't think people appreciate when they talk about kind of the horrors of socialism, just how pervasive it is, that nothing is outside their purview, including who you're sleeping with and whether you're produced, and just how far they're willing to push these issues.
[01:20:56.921 --> 01:20:57.642]  Well, here's an example.
[01:20:57.702 --> 01:21:00.604]  I pointed out that people in Western countries have higher IQs.
[01:21:01.425 --> 01:21:05.508]  Whether they're black or white, the people in third world countries, that's not a statement saying they're inferior.
[01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:11.132]  They're getting lower calories when they're growing, so they do have lower IQs by the very extension of that.
[01:21:11.272 --> 01:21:12.653]  And we see this in Korea.
[01:21:12.813 --> 01:21:20.398]  So North and South Korea have been separated since the 40s, which they've been a one nation for literally thousands of years, genetically identical.
[01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:24.401]  60 years in terms of human evolution is a drop in the bucket.
[01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:31.223]  And we're seeing not only differences in terms of intelligence because of the severe malnutrition in the North, but also differences in height.
[01:21:31.483 --> 01:21:41.525]  Now anyone, you don't have to be a scientist, you don't have to be a biologist to understand if you have two kids and this kid is going to get fed and is going to have, you know, a thriving environment and this kid doesn't have access.
[01:21:41.565 --> 01:21:47.567]  You can always tell the run, like with pigs or cats, the one that's too little that can't root or there's so many that there's not a tit for them.
[01:21:47.867 --> 01:21:49.128]  They're half the size of the others.
[01:21:49.248 --> 01:21:59.915]  Right, but the thing is when you have the person who has the genetic capacity, but then you're depriving nourishment from them, they end up becoming the runt, although they did not have to be that way.
[01:22:00.335 --> 01:22:05.319]  And when you have things like this in these totalitarian states, when government... Which use food as a weapon, they admit.
[01:22:05.339 --> 01:22:07.000]  The UN says we use food... That's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.261]  They use food as a weapon.
[01:22:08.681 --> 01:22:13.583]  And I think Americans, you know, being someone who's born in the Soviet Union, I've done work with North Korea, as you mentioned earlier.
[01:22:13.603 --> 01:22:16.844]  I don't think Americans realize Venezuela.
[01:22:17.024 --> 01:22:17.824]  We don't have to talk about it.
[01:22:17.844 --> 01:22:18.924]  Venezuela is happening right now.
[01:22:19.825 --> 01:22:22.085]  The Chavez government makes sure that their goons get fed.
[01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:23.706]  I was just talking yesterday.
[01:22:23.726 --> 01:22:25.826]  I was on the Trigonometry podcast we recorded.
[01:22:25.846 --> 01:22:27.507]  I won the co-host from Venezuela.
[01:22:27.867 --> 01:22:28.067]  I don't
[01:22:46.357 --> 01:22:52.539]  What is it like being a historian, world traveler, grew up in the Soviet Union to see the majority of millennials say they want communism?
[01:22:52.879 --> 01:22:53.959]  I mean, that is insane.
[01:22:54.439 --> 01:22:54.879]  It's not.
[01:22:54.999 --> 01:22:56.260]  I wouldn't say it's insane.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.080]  I don't think they know what they're saying.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:13.204]  And the reason why they don't know what they're saying is you cannot expect government schools, you cannot expect the New York Times, who has lost millions of bodies of blood in their hands with the Ukrainian genocide, you can't expect CNN to explain to this population
[01:23:13.644 --> 01:23:14.626]  Just how bad it was.
[01:23:14.706 --> 01:23:17.992]  And spoiler alert, my next book is going to be exactly on this subject.
[01:23:18.012 --> 01:23:19.134]  It'll be out before the end of the year.
[01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.458]  And I'm sure we'll be back on to talk about it.
[01:23:21.719 --> 01:23:24.063]  Assuming I don't burn this bridge today, which might happen.
[01:23:25.011 --> 01:23:25.852]  Well, we're just excited.
[01:23:25.892 --> 01:23:28.954]  In fact, tell us, coming up in the next hour, all the things you want to cover.
[01:23:28.974 --> 01:23:33.058]  Because I really, you're an exciting guy, smart guy, and I'm a big fan.
[01:23:33.338 --> 01:23:34.379]  What do you want to cover in the next hour?
[01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:42.686]  I just want to talk about, I think, why the good guys are winning in this country, which I think a lot of people need to hear and don't appreciate.
[01:23:43.066 --> 01:23:43.566]  And I agree.
[01:23:43.646 --> 01:23:45.047]  I think all this tyranny is a
[01:23:45.928 --> 01:23:48.691]  Reflexive action, because the establishment's losing control.
[01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:49.712]  Yes, yeah.
[01:23:49.952 --> 01:23:52.315]  You don't hit a kid who's listening to you.
[01:23:52.575 --> 01:23:57.901]  You hit a kid when they're acting out, and at a certain point, that kid's gonna get big enough, and you hit him, he's not gonna care.
[01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:00.403]  And maybe that's a bad metaphor here, but... Oh, it's excellent.
[01:24:00.563 --> 01:24:00.764]  Yeah.
[01:24:02.315 --> 01:24:06.058]  That was just kind of, you want to get into like just how it is I think that they're losing?
[01:24:06.078 --> 01:24:06.659]  Yeah.
[01:24:06.859 --> 01:24:12.644]  Because back in the day you had, talk radio was kind of I think where it started, obviously that's where you have your roots.
[01:24:12.985 --> 01:24:22.033]  When you have three networks like they had in the 50s and 60s for example, ABC, NBC, CBS, everyone came home, they would watch one of the three and they would basically have a consensus.
[01:24:22.073 --> 01:24:24.355]  Now between the three networks they were all hard left.
[01:24:24.735 --> 01:24:26.877]  And Reagan knew that and got rid of the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:24:49.614 --> 01:24:51.295]  Yes, and that fairness doctrine.
[01:24:51.595 --> 01:24:51.995]  Fairness?
[01:24:52.236 --> 01:24:54.297]  Is there any more Orwellian word than fairness?
[01:24:54.357 --> 01:24:55.517]  Like, I'm in Washington.
[01:24:55.677 --> 01:24:57.138]  I'm going to decide what's fair.
[01:24:57.318 --> 01:25:03.002]  Well, my definition of fair is always going to be that which furthers my interests and the interests of corporate America.
[01:25:03.322 --> 01:25:05.263]  And it's never going to be the interest of the little guy.
[01:25:05.603 --> 01:25:13.466]  At the very least, I'm not even able to hear his voice because I'm getting my phone rang off the hook by lobbyists, prominent corporations, prominent other politicians, and so on and so forth.
[01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:26.592]  How do people find your podcast?
[01:25:26.612 --> 01:25:27.493]  How do they find your books?
[01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:28.794]  How do they find Michael Malice?
[01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:31.516]  And then share it with others, because we need to promote people that are smart.
[01:25:31.736 --> 01:25:33.818]  Sure, you go to twitter.com slash Michael Malice.
[01:25:33.918 --> 01:25:39.183]  Anarchist Handbook was the last book, and the show's called You're Welcome, so it's youtube.com slash MichaelMaliceOfficial.
[01:25:39.383 --> 01:25:40.704]  Folks really liked our last interview.
[01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:41.465]  It was so fun!
[01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.097]  You hit me with a lot of questions.
[01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:45.278]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:25:45.318 --> 01:25:46.258]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:25:46.318 --> 01:25:56.323]  I think you have, people don't appreciate because there's this caricature of Alex Jones that you've been doing this for so long, for so many years, that you really have a lot of arcane knowledge that other people are privy to.
[01:25:56.603 --> 01:25:58.124]  And that's the comment people always give you.
[01:25:58.144 --> 01:26:03.586]  Like when you were on Rogan and you're on Tim and you're riding along things and sometimes in a provocative, performative way.
[01:26:03.986 --> 01:26:09.009]  But then when they search for you and what you're referring to, you're not completely just making things up.
[01:26:09.029 --> 01:26:09.969]  It's like, this was the headline.
[01:26:09.989 --> 01:26:10.229]  That's right.
[01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:11.470]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:11.870]  Stay with us.
[01:26:13.331 --> 01:26:15.572]  Michael Malice is in studio here.
[01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:18.434]  We're just talking about Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, you name it.
[01:26:18.494 --> 01:26:22.616]  The fact that they go, oh, Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones now, or Joe Rogan's Alex Jones now.
[01:26:22.676 --> 01:26:23.536]  No, that's not what's happening.
[01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:26.318]  Michael Malice is a big historian, author.
[01:26:26.738 --> 01:26:28.079]  He knows all the same stuff I know.
[01:26:28.279 --> 01:26:36.523]  The fact that we know New York was the headquarters of eugenics, and that Hitler used New York laws, or the Nazis did, as their defense at Nuremberg.
[01:26:36.783 --> 01:26:39.165]  That's not Michael Malice repeating what Alex Jones said.
[01:26:39.385 --> 01:26:40.226]  That's the history.
[01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:43.168]  And the left tries to play this game like, oh, Jones is this kook.
[01:26:43.848 --> 01:26:46.070]  And then try to say, oh, you know, don't repeat what he says.
[01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:47.671]  You're not repeating what I said.
[01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:50.793]  No, the thing I made the point is, let's suppose I didn't speak English, right?
[01:26:50.813 --> 01:26:54.916]  And I'm seeing you and how you perform and how you act and you're very animated and have this certain perspective.
[01:26:55.237 --> 01:26:57.779]  And then I watch CNN, the guy's in a suit and talking very calmly.
[01:26:58.199 --> 01:27:01.802]  I would think that second CNN guy is respectable and knows what he's talking about.
[01:27:02.022 --> 01:27:03.383]  And Alex is just a crazy person, right?
[01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:13.569]  But that is a technique that they use, because if they present themselves in a certain way, and we're trained since we're kids to perceive professionals as being educated, trust the experts, right?
[01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:15.290]  So of course- It's a uniform!
[01:27:15.451 --> 01:27:16.231]  It's a unif- Right.
[01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:16.992]  It's exactly right.
[01:27:17.012 --> 01:27:20.494]  You trust the cop because he's wearing that uniform, you trust the firefighter, so on and so forth.
[01:27:20.954 --> 01:27:28.257]  I'm the producer, I'm the reporter, the corporate journalist on these venues, spreading really depraved and malevolent ideas.
[01:27:28.537 --> 01:27:31.399]  But because I'm in a suit and I'm calm, look at Dan Rather.
[01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:38.602]  In 1994, when the Republicans took over Congress for the first time in 40 years, you would think that sometimes you'd want one of the parties to switch.
[01:27:38.822 --> 01:27:42.684]  First time in 40 years, he's saying the American people are throwing a temper tantrum tonight.
[01:27:43.084 --> 01:27:54.592]  So a lot of times when they don't get their way, that air of professionalism and assertiveness drops and you realize that behind that smile, as Ayn Rand put it back in the day, there was something sinister and something evil.
[01:27:54.933 --> 01:28:07.442]  And the beautiful thing about social media is when you scratch these people and kind of tweet at them and they get upset, you really see that there is a really nasty sneer behind that veneer of calm professionalism.
[01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.483]  And they take themselves so seriously.
[01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:11.144]  Like, I never did all this on purpose.
[01:28:11.164 --> 01:28:12.204]  It's some master plan.
[01:28:12.504 --> 01:28:14.385]  But when they sue me, they ask, where's the master plan?
[01:28:14.405 --> 01:28:15.486]  Who told you to say this or that?
[01:28:15.746 --> 01:28:17.387]  We didn't do a pre-interview of what we're about to talk about.
[01:28:17.407 --> 01:28:18.127]  We're just here talking.
[01:28:18.908 --> 01:28:22.489]  I have fun sometimes, and the common folks like that, because it's not an act.
[01:28:22.549 --> 01:28:27.612]  And they take that as more credible than me up here, perfectly looking into the camera, reading off a teleprompter.
[01:28:27.972 --> 01:28:32.833]  You can't fight for your values unless at the same time you're having a good time sometimes.
[01:28:33.193 --> 01:28:38.734]  No human being has that emotional fuel and stamina without taking a break, recharging, and enjoying themselves.
[01:28:39.034 --> 01:28:42.735]  And honestly, if you're not fighting for freedom and having fun at the same time, what's the point?
[01:28:43.035 --> 01:28:46.076]  What's the point of freedom if you're not enjoying life and thriving?
[01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:46.596]  I agree.
[01:28:46.616 --> 01:28:49.316]  Let me ask you a question and we're going to really kick into things next segment.
[01:28:49.636 --> 01:28:51.797]  Can we put Brian Stilter back on screen, please?
[01:28:52.277 --> 01:28:53.957]  He puts this photo out himself.
[01:28:54.337 --> 01:28:57.678]  Now, how disconnected from reality do you have to put... because that's a horror movie cover.
[01:28:58.258 --> 01:28:59.519]  Like a clown that eats children.
[01:28:59.539 --> 01:29:00.801]  Have you not watched The Simpsons?
[01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:02.102]  They took 800 takes.
[01:29:02.142 --> 01:29:02.942]  This was the best one.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:11.141]  Yeah, but how is he not self-aware that he looks like a true nightmare vision?
[01:29:11.382 --> 01:29:16.162]  I don't know if you've seen this on C-SPAN.
[01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:17.503]  Everybody attacked him.
[01:29:17.863 --> 01:29:22.644]  Yeah, and I had this thing on Instagram about the red pill versus the blue pill.
[01:29:22.984 --> 01:29:28.865]  While Brian Stelter is talking to America about Trump's misspellings on Twitter, they're also covering, not CNN specifically,
[01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:31.688]  They're covering up for Jeffrey Epstein and all his assaults.
[01:29:31.928 --> 01:29:33.049]  Which of these things is worse?
[01:29:33.089 --> 01:29:34.751]  That a president in your mind is illiterate?
[01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:39.115]  Or that there's an international network of people... I kind of like he made mistakes.
[01:29:39.155 --> 01:29:39.956]  It means he's being real.
[01:29:41.317 --> 01:29:41.597]  So what?
[01:29:41.778 --> 01:29:43.840]  I was Brooklyn Spelling Bee champion in 1986.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:44.720]  You could look it up.
[01:29:45.041 --> 01:29:47.003]  If someone doesn't know how to spell, it doesn't mean their ideas are wrong.
[01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:48.144]  What difference does it make?
[01:29:48.544 --> 01:29:51.046]  Yeah, exactly, but let's just go back to Brian Stelter here.
[01:29:51.707 --> 01:29:53.528]  What does his photo say to you?
[01:29:53.568 --> 01:29:56.711]  If you were just a Martian that came, what does that look like?
[01:29:56.911 --> 01:30:03.776]  I mean, that looks like the most disingenuous, sneaky, and he's anti-free speech, he's anti-America, he also is a piece of garbage, but look at that!
[01:30:04.137 --> 01:30:08.580]  If you're Jeff Zucker, I guess because he looks like him, why would you try to put that out to the public?
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:17.748]  Look, I'm an underwear model for Sheath Underwear, if you go to SheathUnderwear.com, so I'm not in a position to make fun of people who aren't as attractive as me, so I'm going to have to defer from this question and leave it to you, sir.
[01:30:18.468 --> 01:30:20.289]  Well, I mean, look at that.
[01:30:20.329 --> 01:30:21.529]  Look at that photo.
[01:30:21.810 --> 01:30:29.133]  Look, honestly, Alex, I think there's far worse things about Brian Stelter than how he... I know, but he just...
[01:30:30.385 --> 01:30:33.408]  He's the creepiest looking dude I've ever seen.
[01:30:33.488 --> 01:30:34.008]  Oh, he's not.
[01:30:34.028 --> 01:30:34.969]  There's a lot creepier than that.
[01:30:35.009 --> 01:30:36.971]  You know who I think is much more sinister?
[01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:37.872]  It's Anderson Cooper.
[01:30:38.012 --> 01:30:39.433]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:30:39.473 --> 01:30:40.134]  He's a blue blood.
[01:30:40.174 --> 01:30:40.854]  He's a Vanderbilt.
[01:30:40.874 --> 01:30:41.535]  He's a Vanderbilt.
[01:30:42.075 --> 01:30:43.777]  I mean, you cut him, it bleeds blue.
[01:30:44.557 --> 01:30:47.039]  And for him to be like, I'm a man of the people, that's much more sinister.
[01:30:47.139 --> 01:30:49.021]  Oh, when you go online, it says he owns nothing.
[01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:49.862]  He gave it all to charity.
[01:30:50.122 --> 01:30:50.963]  He's just like Bill Gates.
[01:30:51.003 --> 01:30:51.864]  It's all tax exempt.
[01:30:52.104 --> 01:30:53.785]  The man's worth probably $500 billion.
[01:30:53.925 --> 01:30:55.186]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:55.206 --> 01:30:55.607]  Stay with us.
[01:30:57.475 --> 01:31:01.458]  Michael Malice is in the ATX, and he's moving here!
[01:31:01.478 --> 01:31:01.998]  I am.
[01:31:02.138 --> 01:31:02.539]  Can't wait.
[01:31:03.279 --> 01:31:03.900]  All right, buddy.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.000]  Wow.
[01:31:05.141 --> 01:31:05.981]  Where do you want to start?
[01:31:06.021 --> 01:31:07.903]  We've already done a couple of segments here on fire.
[01:31:07.923 --> 01:31:09.664]  I agree.
[01:31:09.724 --> 01:31:13.947]  We're winning, and this whole globalist attack is an exercise of raw power.
[01:31:13.987 --> 01:31:19.391]  They said in the Rockefeller Foundation documents 11 years ago, Operation Lockstep, they would try this to maintain control.
[01:31:19.431 --> 01:31:21.232]  You read their internal CFR stuff that leaks.
[01:31:21.592 --> 01:31:22.893]  They are in panic mode right now.
[01:31:22.913 --> 01:31:25.835]  So as bad as all this is, this was done through desperation.
[01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:26.476]  Elaborate on that.
[01:31:26.656 --> 01:31:29.359]  Well, I mean, let's just talk about American politics, where it's much simpler.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.142]  There's a 50-50 split in the Senate.
[01:31:32.202 --> 01:31:38.188]  There was just an article a day or two ago, I feel like Alex right now, where Biden campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy.
[01:31:38.228 --> 01:31:38.848]  That's DOA.
[01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:41.271]  We're already in July.
[01:31:41.731 --> 01:31:47.057]  There's been very little progress about the Democratic agenda other than some kind of executive orders.
[01:31:47.617 --> 01:31:54.763]  I think a lot of people who are conservatives who thought, okay, you're going to have Kamala Harris as a tie-break vote in the Senate.
[01:31:54.963 --> 01:31:57.104]  They're going to get whatever they want on the left.
[01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.206]  That has not happened whatsoever.
[01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:05.531]  You had people like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, centrist Democrats from West Virginia and Arizona respectively are saying,
[01:32:05.731 --> 01:32:07.212]  We're not going to get rid of the filibuster.
[01:32:07.432 --> 01:32:30.050]  Here's the other thing, for a party that, I'm not a fan of democracy to put it mildly, but for a party that calls itself the Democratic Party and wants to get rid of the filibuster and have a 50-50 rule and basically put forth whatever they do, meanwhile two years ago they were talking about how much they like the Constitution and, you know, our nation's traditions and Trump's an assault on that, what you realize is people in power, and this applies to Republicans most certainly as much as the Democrats,
[01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:34.314]  We'll say whatever they need to say in order to further their agenda and maintain their power.
[01:32:34.334 --> 01:32:43.101]  So a lot of times people argue on social media with their friends or these kind of bigger names and try to engage with them and you have to realize you don't listen to what they're saying.
[01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:48.206]  What they're saying is, what do I need to say to get you to do what I want?
[01:32:48.566 --> 01:32:57.314]  And one day I'm going to be for the unions and then those union voters are going to vote for Reagan, be Reagan Democrats, and now I'm going to tell you all those union people are illiterate hicks and they're racist, right?
[01:32:57.614 --> 01:33:05.741]  I'll turn in a dime because now that group is no longer of use to furthering my agenda, and I'm sure you've seen this many times throughout your decades of doing this.
[01:33:06.822 --> 01:33:07.642]  I totally agree.
[01:33:07.742 --> 01:33:09.384]  Don't look at what they say, look at what they do.
[01:33:09.424 --> 01:33:11.586]  That's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:33:12.827 --> 01:33:21.554]  So what would you call this period of time we're in right now with the contact tracers and HR 666 to give them law enforcement power?
[01:33:22.094 --> 01:33:24.215]  And all this other crazy stuff.
[01:33:24.275 --> 01:33:29.718]  Oh, $2 billion to open Capitol Police offices to watch the public around the country.
[01:33:29.818 --> 01:33:31.859]  I mean, it really is a metastasization.
[01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.840]  So all the people saying, you're saying we're winning.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:40.524]  We're winning hearts and minds, but is the empire striking back going to be successful in subduing the world?
[01:33:41.104 --> 01:33:41.984]  Uh, that's the question, right?
[01:33:42.205 --> 01:33:52.169]  So one of the things that, you know, if you were looking at Joe Biden, are you going to tell me that this man is a symbol of a healthy, strong, thriving empire?
[01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:54.470]  Or is this an empire on its last legs?
[01:33:54.510 --> 01:34:04.235]  If you look at historic, like, royal families, like, by the end when these houses collapse, you have this kind of drooling old man in charge who has, like... Why does history keep repeating with that?
[01:34:04.275 --> 01:34:07.096]  You'd think an elite in trouble would put a good whipper-stamper in there.
[01:34:07.176 --> 01:34:08.778]  But this is as good as they could get through.
[01:34:08.798 --> 01:34:12.041]  I mean, they were panicking because they almost had Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:12.202 --> 01:34:23.855]  And they were like, crap, we've got to get Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg to fold and get behind Biden because they knew Biden, and they're right, is a reliable party hack, just like some people in the Republican Party.
[01:34:25.433 --> 01:34:27.455]  So what do you expect them to do next?
[01:34:27.635 --> 01:34:32.619]  What are they going to do about Trump, who's still leading the Republican Party, winning a lot of races for Republicans he endorses?
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.441]  Trump's talking about reinstatement.
[01:34:34.481 --> 01:34:35.382]  That really scares them?
[01:34:35.602 --> 01:34:36.823]  But Alex, we already know.
[01:34:36.903 --> 01:34:41.247]  Like, right now we're hearing about this Delta variant and, you know, this Ligma variant, all those variants.
[01:34:41.607 --> 01:34:44.029]  And immediately, these things are DOA.
[01:34:44.089 --> 01:34:48.733]  People are saying, I tweeted this out and I got more likes than the World Health Organization.
[01:34:48.773 --> 01:34:52.877]  I said, I no longer care if I get COVID or somebody else does it.
[01:34:53.217 --> 01:34:56.820]  And if that has that perspective, and I think a lot of Americans, like, we're over this crap.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.061]  I'm not ruining my restaurant.
[01:34:58.301 --> 01:34:59.361]  I'm not ruining my neighborhood.
[01:34:59.602 --> 01:35:02.664]  I'm not wearing these dopey masks, which is like wearing a condom with two holes in it.
[01:35:03.404 --> 01:35:07.367]  And when they have, they're running out of bullets in the chamber.
[01:35:07.727 --> 01:35:10.449]  And that is something I think we should all be happy about.
[01:35:10.690 --> 01:35:15.633]  But they still have a lot of inertia because they've been at this for a long time.
[01:35:15.653 --> 01:35:17.634]  By the way, how long are you here?
[01:35:17.955 --> 01:35:19.676]  I'm here till Monday, my birthday.
[01:35:19.696 --> 01:35:20.697]  I know you gotta look at houses.
[01:35:21.337 --> 01:35:22.278]  There's a film crew.
[01:35:22.438 --> 01:35:23.358]  They're great filmmakers.
[01:35:23.398 --> 01:35:25.499]  They want me to go shooting, and they've been asking for months.
[01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:29.041]  I've got a little piece of property outside Austin with a shooting range.
[01:35:29.261 --> 01:35:30.602]  Why don't I come back and we do that?
[01:35:30.682 --> 01:35:31.542]  We need to go shooting soon.
[01:35:31.562 --> 01:35:31.923]  Let's do that.
[01:35:31.943 --> 01:35:32.523]  That would be a great video.
[01:35:32.543 --> 01:35:34.224]  Because you say you haven't gotten any guns yet.
[01:35:34.484 --> 01:35:35.524]  I have not gotten any guns.
[01:35:35.564 --> 01:35:36.665]  We're going to pop your cherry.
[01:35:36.725 --> 01:35:37.185]  Let's do it.
[01:35:37.485 --> 01:35:38.106]  I would love that.
[01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:39.306]  We've got to get you out there.
[01:35:39.326 --> 01:35:40.207]  What do you want to shoot first?
[01:35:40.727 --> 01:35:42.669]  I don't know from guns, so I want you to educate me.
[01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:45.771]  You want to start with something that doesn't have a lot of recoil.
[01:35:45.791 --> 01:35:46.171]  I've shot a .22.
[01:35:46.211 --> 01:35:47.672]  .50 caliber Barrett.
[01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:48.693]  That's a joke.
[01:35:49.613 --> 01:35:50.554]  I'm a Brooklyn boy.
[01:35:50.654 --> 01:35:52.215]  All I know is getting shot, not how to shoot.
[01:35:53.256 --> 01:35:58.319]  The best thing to start shooting is, just to give you an idea about trajectory and things, I think a .22 is a good thing to shoot.
[01:35:58.339 --> 01:36:01.441]  Yeah, I thought people were going to make fun of me, but no one thinks it's disrespectful.
[01:36:01.501 --> 01:36:02.922]  No, no, a .22 is great.
[01:36:03.142 --> 01:36:07.325]  It's cheap ammo, it's really accurate out to a couple hundred yards, and it's a great thing to plink with.
[01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:09.667]  But isn't it like a girl's handgun for their purse?
[01:36:10.607 --> 01:36:13.750]  Uh, I mean, Mafia uses .22s to execute people.
[01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:14.910]  Oh, okay, then it's fine.
[01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:20.875]  Because you don't get rifling on it, and you can shoot somebody in the head, and then it tends to not go through the other side, it bounces around.
[01:36:21.035 --> 01:36:22.436]  It's a very good assassination weapon.
[01:36:22.596 --> 01:36:23.036]  Oh, okay, good.
[01:36:23.056 --> 01:36:24.137]  Good for killing people at point blank range.
[01:36:24.157 --> 01:36:25.418]  That's on brand, as a good Russian.
[01:36:25.438 --> 01:36:27.500]  Absolutely, you just walk right up, it'll pop inside of the head, yeah.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:28.940]  It's an idea.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.181]  You don't want .380s and things.
[01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:31.282]  They don't have enough penetration.
[01:36:32.002 --> 01:36:33.883]  .22 long rifle is actually a good thing.
[01:36:33.963 --> 01:36:34.723]  This will be the video.
[01:36:34.903 --> 01:36:36.064]  Like I want to hear all of that.
[01:36:36.244 --> 01:36:36.664]  Exactly.
[01:36:36.704 --> 01:36:37.324]  We'll go over it all.
[01:36:37.404 --> 01:36:38.685]  And I want something hipster.
[01:36:38.745 --> 01:36:39.766]  I got some guys working for me.
[01:36:39.786 --> 01:36:40.746]  They're actually firearms experts.
[01:36:40.766 --> 01:36:43.207]  They actually train the expert military.
[01:36:43.587 --> 01:36:44.928]  So they train the best.
[01:36:45.248 --> 01:36:45.508]  Okay.
[01:36:45.528 --> 01:36:46.069]  I would love that.
[01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.869]  This would be a lot of fun.
[01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:48.570]  There I am with McAfee.
[01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:49.510]  And they could laugh at me.
[01:36:49.530 --> 01:36:50.811]  What do you think happened with him?
[01:36:51.391 --> 01:36:52.891]  I think they killed him, yeah.
[01:36:53.292 --> 01:36:54.252]  Did you hear what the wife said?
[01:36:54.552 --> 01:36:56.072]  Did you talk about this in the show already?
[01:36:56.092 --> 01:36:56.392]  Go ahead.
[01:36:56.692 --> 01:36:58.893]  No, I don't know, so I want to hear your perspective.
[01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:04.915]  No, she said that he was going to appeal, and he was totally fine, and he said they were threatening to kill him, basically.
[01:37:05.215 --> 01:37:07.395]  He put out tweets saying, if I'm killed, I was murdered.
[01:37:07.776 --> 01:37:12.017]  But I thought the wife later came out and said he definitely was not murdered and he did take his own life.
[01:37:12.097 --> 01:37:12.877]  Can we look into that?
[01:37:12.957 --> 01:37:14.657]  I didn't see that follow-up.
[01:37:14.677 --> 01:37:15.978]  They come and tell you, we're going to kill you, honey.
[01:37:17.538 --> 01:37:33.504]  I'm not going to tell the name, but there's a very famous musician, probably the most famous ever, who said he was more famous than Jesus, and I actually got to know some folks, and I learned the whole FBI thing about what happened in New York and everything else, and they basically came and told him, you're going to shut up and say this or you're next.
[01:37:33.904 --> 01:37:38.726]  All they got to do is break into your house a few times, and the FBI comes by and says, you don't want that to happen anymore, keep your mouth shut.
[01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.247]  Do you know what the Stasi did in East Germany?
[01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:43.068]  They had something that is roughly translated to disintegration.
[01:37:43.208 --> 01:37:47.349]  So what they would do is they'd go to your house and take out your socks from your sock drawer and leave them on your bed.
[01:37:47.749 --> 01:37:49.010]  And now there's two possibilities.
[01:37:49.050 --> 01:37:50.830]  Either you're going crazy, why are these socks on my bed?
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:51.651]  Or why does this keep happening?
[01:37:52.031 --> 01:37:56.952]  Or that's their way of telling you, we can get to you anytime we want, so you better stay in line.
[01:37:57.032 --> 01:37:58.033]  It's very easy.
[01:37:58.573 --> 01:37:58.673]  Oh, 100%!
[01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:00.874]  Or they'll call you up and say,
[01:38:01.354 --> 01:38:04.836]  Hey, I saw you, you know, slip on your back porch and fall down today.
[01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:08.037]  Too bad you don't fall down and die, and you literally just fell on your porch.
[01:38:08.118 --> 01:38:12.020]  This was when Colombia was under the control of Pablo Escobar and the narco-terroristas.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.161]  There was a woman from Colombia, a politician, I forget her name.
[01:38:14.701 --> 01:38:16.162]  She came to America to ask for help.
[01:38:16.462 --> 01:38:19.924]  She got a phone call, and they said, this is where your daughter was at 8 a.m.
[01:38:20.204 --> 01:38:21.244]  This is where she was at 10 a.m.
[01:38:21.384 --> 01:38:24.306]  Your schoolyard daughter, this is where she was at 2 p.m.
[01:38:24.526 --> 01:38:26.467]  She got on that flight back to Bogota as soon as she could do.
[01:38:26.547 --> 01:38:30.512]  They did that to Dr. Group, who was one of my best guests, and he called me.
[01:38:30.692 --> 01:38:32.014]  He'd been talking for like two years.
[01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:34.417]  And he said, go ahead and tell the story, but I can't come back on.
[01:38:34.497 --> 01:38:38.882]  And they called all his employees, his wife, everybody, and said where they were, where they were at lunch.
[01:38:39.363 --> 01:38:41.566]  And he's just like, hey, I'm not scared, but my wife's gonna...
[01:38:41.966 --> 01:38:42.466]  Can't handle it.
[01:38:42.526 --> 01:38:42.907]  I get it.
[01:38:43.027 --> 01:38:43.847]  I mean, this is war.
[01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:47.269]  He was in the military, but he's not signed up for this.
[01:38:47.309 --> 01:38:48.230]  That's how bad this has gotten.
[01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:50.471]  And I'll even defend them in one perspective.
[01:38:50.511 --> 01:39:00.017]  If the choice is I go to your house and put a bullet on you, or I pick up the phone and I scare you, I think I personally would rather the second one that I just get scared and they threaten me than they actually do something.
[01:39:00.037 --> 01:39:01.478]  Yeah, well, they've done all that to me.
[01:39:01.718 --> 01:39:02.939]  And it's not that I'm Mr. Tough Guy.
[01:39:02.999 --> 01:39:03.879]  I just can't live in fear.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.540]  And so that's the way it is.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.142]  And if they're going to try to kill me, then we got people that are going to try to defend me.
[01:39:08.562 --> 01:39:08.782]  Yeah.
[01:39:09.263 --> 01:39:11.164]  And then I hold the whole establishment.
[01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:14.768]  Anything happens to me, they see I commit suicide, folks, you know what to do.
[01:39:15.528 --> 01:39:17.670]  Because I think killing Alex Jones might start the revolution.
[01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:21.814]  I don't think that... I don't know how to respond to that.
[01:39:21.954 --> 01:39:24.616]  Well, if they kill me, I sure as hell didn't commit suicide.
[01:39:24.997 --> 01:39:27.038]  I want Darth Vader level medical treatment.
[01:39:27.479 --> 01:39:28.680]  I will never kill myself.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:31.222]  I'm going to hold on to life to the very end.
[01:39:31.242 --> 01:39:34.185]  I'm just imagining you coming down the hill.
[01:39:35.313 --> 01:39:37.194]  Rex, I am your father.
[01:39:52.699 --> 01:39:59.584]  Well, you know, Dick Cheney, who is the longest-lived person, which makes me think he's an alien, he lived almost two years with an external heart pump.
[01:40:00.265 --> 01:40:02.827]  So it's an artificial heart outside the body, with no pulse.
[01:40:02.847 --> 01:40:06.069]  They say most people, like, go crazy and, like, freak out with no pulse.
[01:40:06.429 --> 01:40:07.971]  Cheney, almost two years, no pulse.
[01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:10.613]  Well, he would joke about that, that he was literally heartless.
[01:40:10.833 --> 01:40:12.714]  Like, literally, people, look this up.
[01:40:12.734 --> 01:40:13.955]  This is Simon McAlex.
[01:40:14.215 --> 01:40:15.036]  This is not made up.
[01:40:15.156 --> 01:40:17.498]  Dick Cheney literally does not have a human heart in his body.
[01:40:18.365 --> 01:40:19.445]  I don't want to die either.
[01:40:19.485 --> 01:40:21.586]  I mean, I'm not afraid of death, but I'm going to try to live as long as possible.
[01:40:21.886 --> 01:40:23.907]  So if they kill me, I was killed, not suicided.
[01:40:23.927 --> 01:40:24.807]  We'll be right back with Michael Malice.
[01:40:25.747 --> 01:40:27.428]  Michael Malice wants to talk about me.
[01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:28.188]  I do.
[01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:33.789]  And I want to talk about him because I literally do watch his podcast when it comes out every week, sometimes multiple times.
[01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:35.970]  And I also like the comedy stuff you're doing.
[01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:38.011]  I also like some of these scientific talks you do.
[01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.771]  I mean, you're doing a lot.
[01:40:40.331 --> 01:40:46.073]  And I want to get into your exodus out of New York, a microcosm of them losing, because we were just talking about this during the break again.
[01:40:46.733 --> 01:40:49.714]  That they wanted 90% to take the injections.
[01:40:49.834 --> 01:40:50.854]  It's really like 50%.
[01:40:51.454 --> 01:40:52.495]  They admit they're failing.
[01:40:52.515 --> 01:40:58.376]  They admit people are refusing them and are not adopting this because if you're bringing a tyranny in, you need the vast majority to comply.
[01:40:58.676 --> 01:41:04.018]  If they've got 30, 40% that are completely not submitting and more every day saying no, this is actually a big failure for them.
[01:41:04.138 --> 01:41:05.159]  Here's another big failure.
[01:41:05.179 --> 01:41:11.644]  What COVID enabled them to do was to decentralize authoritarianism and basically make everyone a member of the secret police.
[01:41:11.684 --> 01:41:19.910]  We've seen reports over and over, people calling the cops in their neighbors, people calling someone in the subway or in the TSA when people aren't complying with these
[01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:21.571]  We're good to go.
[01:41:40.242 --> 01:41:41.282]  And you know her day is ruined.
[01:41:41.602 --> 01:41:51.746]  Increasingly, not only are people not saying yes to someone wagging, some stranger wagging their finger at them, but they're laughing at that person's face and returning it twice as hard.
[01:41:52.326 --> 01:41:55.067]  They have been trained to think, I'm the good guy.
[01:41:55.087 --> 01:41:58.348]  I will yell at Alex Jones and say, why aren't you wearing a mask?
[01:41:58.688 --> 01:42:00.289]  Everyone's going to stand up and applaud.
[01:42:00.609 --> 01:42:07.531]  And they haven't, CNN and all these other outlets, haven't programmed them to be like, okay, what happens when that dude says, go F yourself?
[01:42:07.671 --> 01:42:08.792]  What are you going to do then, sweetheart?
[01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:27.630]  Too bad.
[01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:28.771]  That is the reality.
[01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:31.291]  That's how you're going to have to deal with it going forward.
[01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.792]  Here's something I encourage people to do.
[01:42:33.692 --> 01:42:35.052]  Play into their ignorance.
[01:42:35.413 --> 01:42:37.893]  Make them as emotionally distressed as possible.
[01:42:38.173 --> 01:42:42.555]  If someone comes up to you and says to put on a mask, whatever, just sell them with a straight face.
[01:42:42.575 --> 01:42:42.995]  Play dumb.
[01:42:43.275 --> 01:42:44.215]  Say, oh, I can't get it.
[01:42:44.235 --> 01:42:45.216]  I've never been to China.
[01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:53.258]  Let them think that you are this moron because now they're going to further their belief that they're surrounded by morons who are putting their lives in danger.
[01:42:53.518 --> 01:42:55.339]  And when they're that distressed, hilarity ensues.
[01:42:55.839 --> 01:43:00.363]  What I do is I've seen them doing it to other people and I butt in.
[01:43:00.403 --> 01:43:04.767]  I go, you know Fauci wrote a paper saying it gives you bacterial pneumonia and it's filthy.
[01:43:05.067 --> 01:43:10.011]  And you know masks only work if they're a certain grade and they change them constantly and they change the gloves constantly.
[01:43:10.031 --> 01:43:12.153]  I go, oh, oh, but I thought you're for science.
[01:43:12.173 --> 01:43:12.854]  And then I go further.
[01:43:13.174 --> 01:43:18.119]  Well, you notice they're saying that people that have taken the vaccine are still getting COVID, which it was a fraud.
[01:43:18.159 --> 01:43:18.899]  You know that, right?
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.901]  And then by then they're just going, hey, hey, hey.
[01:43:20.921 --> 01:43:21.482]  And I'm like, listen,
[01:43:22.142 --> 01:43:24.643]  If you're wearing your stupid mask and you're taking your shot, you're safe!
[01:43:24.843 --> 01:43:25.903]  Then leave me the hell alone!
[01:43:26.183 --> 01:43:27.724]  Don't you liberals think there's too many people?
[01:43:27.944 --> 01:43:29.044]  Isn't there too many people on Earth?
[01:43:29.244 --> 01:43:30.104]  Do you want me to die?
[01:43:30.124 --> 01:43:32.245]  I mean, I... That's what I started doing.
[01:43:32.265 --> 01:43:34.745]  There's a website I use called minimallycompliedmasks.com.
[01:43:35.025 --> 01:43:36.726]  You still have to wear the mask on the plane.
[01:43:36.986 --> 01:43:40.007]  These masks look like masks, but they completely let you breathe.
[01:43:40.407 --> 01:43:44.788]  And, you know, at a certain point, people are just going to have to look the other way because there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:43:44.828 --> 01:43:47.669]  Well, yeah, folks said I was a hypocrite selling these thin cloth masks.
[01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:48.109]  Oh, you sell them too?
[01:43:48.129 --> 01:43:48.429]  Okay, yeah.
[01:43:49.029 --> 01:43:55.896]  And I said, it's got Infowars.com, I said, if they're going to make you do it in some places and you've got to do it, then you need to use it against them.
[01:43:55.976 --> 01:43:56.977]  Yes, exactly.
[01:43:57.017 --> 01:43:57.217]  Right.
[01:43:57.317 --> 01:44:05.725]  So this is kind of this passive resistance, which is a great way that Americans have historically given the finger to the state and the powers that be, which is something I could not be a bigger proponent of.
[01:44:05.865 --> 01:44:07.527]  Talk about New York, because L.A.
[01:44:07.567 --> 01:44:08.487]  has a horrible vibe.
[01:44:08.567 --> 01:44:09.268]  I can't stand it.
[01:44:09.388 --> 01:44:09.748]  I hate it.
[01:44:09.768 --> 01:44:10.869]  I love the rest of California.
[01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:13.331]  New York, I've been there probably 50 times.
[01:44:13.472 --> 01:44:13.952]  I love it.
[01:44:13.972 --> 01:44:14.653]  Love the restaurants.
[01:44:14.713 --> 01:44:15.333]  Love the museums.
[01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:16.714]  What restaurants?
[01:44:16.734 --> 01:44:17.295]  They're closed now.
[01:44:17.335 --> 01:44:20.357]  Central Park's great, but now it literally...
[01:44:21.258 --> 01:44:22.519]  Feels like a cult there.
[01:44:22.539 --> 01:44:25.442]  And most folks are leaving.
[01:44:25.462 --> 01:44:25.902]  You're leaving.
[01:44:26.042 --> 01:44:26.903]  What has happened in New York?
[01:44:27.203 --> 01:44:28.764]  I have lived in New York all my life.
[01:44:29.104 --> 01:44:30.826]  Like I said earlier, I don't even know how to drive.
[01:44:31.887 --> 01:44:33.648]  And I was always ride or die.
[01:44:33.928 --> 01:44:36.591]  Like when people leave in New York, oh, you can't handle it.
[01:44:36.631 --> 01:44:37.171]  You're weak.
[01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:37.812]  This is great.
[01:44:37.852 --> 01:44:39.093]  I would defend the crowdedness.
[01:44:39.133 --> 01:44:39.953]  I defend the dirt.
[01:44:40.354 --> 01:44:45.738]  And now seeing what they've done to my beloved city is like watching my kid getting beaten in front of me.
[01:44:47.039 --> 01:44:50.942]  It hurts me to the fiber, to the, you know, the basis of who I am as a person.
[01:44:51.282 --> 01:44:52.083]  All my friends left.
[01:44:52.143 --> 01:44:58.388]  I'm so excited to be in Austin because I've got my crew here, my, you know, love and support from all the people who used to be in New York.
[01:44:58.448 --> 01:44:59.209]  I was the last one.
[01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:04.553]  At a certain point, you look around and you're like, what am, you know, it's kind of like a, you know, like a bad breakup.
[01:45:04.573 --> 01:45:06.335]  It's like, what am I fighting for anymore?
[01:45:06.595 --> 01:45:11.759]  Like all the places I used to like, these little boutiques that made New York unique and special, they couldn't survive.
[01:45:11.779 --> 01:45:12.440]  You know who survived?
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.762]  Amazon, Target, Walmart,
[01:45:15.302 --> 01:45:15.782]  I like those.
[01:45:15.802 --> 01:45:16.622]  Well, they thrived.
[01:45:16.662 --> 01:45:17.142]  They thrived.
[01:45:17.162 --> 01:45:17.883]  They thrived.
[01:45:18.003 --> 01:45:27.365]  Carol Roth had this great book called The War on Small Business, and she talked about how several trillions of dollars wealth transfer from small and medium businesses to places like Jeff Bezos and Target.
[01:45:27.585 --> 01:45:34.466]  Now, they serve a purpose, but I don't need to go to New York and have it become a gigantic mall of America.
[01:45:34.506 --> 01:45:35.186]  We have that already.
[01:45:35.206 --> 01:45:41.768]  But it was also big tech and big boxes that led the lockdown because they'd already done the actuaries and studies knowing they wouldn't expand their market.
[01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:42.568]  Well, that's that's
[01:45:43.368 --> 01:45:44.089]  Total monopoly.
[01:45:58.584 --> 01:46:00.045]  And that, of course, goes to their benefit.
[01:46:00.065 --> 01:46:00.765]  You've still got to eat.
[01:46:01.065 --> 01:46:06.928]  If I can't go to the restaurant, I can't go to the store, well, these other places deliver, and that just makes them wealthier, and it makes them more powerful.
[01:46:07.148 --> 01:46:13.531]  Because as these corporations get more money, it's not just nefarious that they make more money, more power to them in one sense, but that means they can get better lobbyists.
[01:46:13.771 --> 01:46:14.971]  That means they pay more taxes.
[01:46:14.991 --> 01:46:15.892]  That was my question!
[01:46:16.712 --> 01:46:19.273]  They get senators on the phone very, very easily.
[01:46:20.214 --> 01:46:22.055]  Would you call yourself a libertarian?
[01:46:22.235 --> 01:46:22.855]  I'm an anarchist.
[01:46:23.355 --> 01:46:24.195]  Without adjectives.
[01:46:24.456 --> 01:46:27.237]  So explain to me, and I'm going to cover this next segment because we've got three minutes left.
[01:46:28.414 --> 01:46:34.600]  I've been a big libertarian, major anarchist, leanings, I get all that.
[01:46:35.261 --> 01:46:44.189]  The problem is, big corporations then have lobbied for libertarian ideas, but then they just exempt themselves from law and then they set up governmental systems.
[01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:50.095]  They get as big as government, they act worse than government, then they team up and buy the government, and then so I'm sitting here
[01:46:51.599 --> 01:46:55.381]  Watching this takeover the Heritage Foundation has helped do, and then I don't trust the government either.
[01:46:55.701 --> 01:47:01.363]  So what do you do, caught between these two big power centers that are revolving doors incestuously screwing us over?
[01:47:01.563 --> 01:47:04.244]  That's something that I think is really important that you point out.
[01:47:04.264 --> 01:47:07.125]  It's something that I'm very happy that conservatives have come to appreciate.
[01:47:07.425 --> 01:47:10.446]  For a long time, you know, you and I are roughly around the same age.
[01:47:10.486 --> 01:47:14.608]  We remember when we were younger, the left, the liberals would always attack the corporations.
[01:47:14.748 --> 01:47:15.348]  Corporate America.
[01:47:15.388 --> 01:47:16.108]  Occupy Wall Street.
[01:47:16.128 --> 01:47:16.909]  Corporate America is bad.
[01:47:17.549 --> 01:47:17.689]  I don't
[01:47:47.509 --> 01:47:53.590]  And I really try now to only shop and support small boutiques and things.
[01:47:53.931 --> 01:47:56.891]  Used to, I wanted to go to the big box store because they got a bigger selection, it's quick, I get it.
[01:47:57.151 --> 01:48:01.132]  But they're so predatory now, I can't catch myself supporting big things anymore.
[01:48:01.312 --> 01:48:04.673]  Well, they're predatory because they work hand-in-hand with the state.
[01:48:04.753 --> 01:48:09.194]  If you had a stateless society, a free society, a lot of this... They wouldn't have that enforcement.
[01:48:09.234 --> 01:48:12.195]  Right, because corporations exist because of the will of the state.
[01:48:12.395 --> 01:48:17.398]  Look at Twitter and all these other social media outlets where they have that exemption where they're not responsible.
[01:48:17.618 --> 01:48:21.160]  Whereas if I had my own little website, I'd be run out of business in five minutes.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.281]  So this is inevitably what happens.
[01:48:23.782 --> 01:48:26.523]  Oh, the courts treat me completely different than other people.
[01:48:26.543 --> 01:48:27.084]  Of course.
[01:48:28.064 --> 01:48:33.048]  And that's the thing, when you talk about objective law, this is kind of this American idea that everyone's equal before the law.
[01:48:33.329 --> 01:48:43.898]  That's also complete nonsense, because rich people will always have access to better lawyers, and they're going to come from a higher social class, so they're going to come off in a certain way very different from some poor person.
[01:48:43.938 --> 01:48:45.079]  Maybe that person's not educated.
[01:48:45.099 --> 01:48:46.980]  Plus, those judges on average are so political.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:47.381]  Right!
[01:48:47.501 --> 01:48:51.824]  Like, if I'm a judge... Stay there, let's come right back and talk about that and so much more with Michael Malin.
[01:48:51.844 --> 01:48:52.225]  Stay with us.
[01:48:53.817 --> 01:49:05.686]  Alright, Michael Malice and I are having some really good banter here on this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, and we're doing a special Saturday show tomorrow that'll be commercial-free, so look for that to air at 4 p.m.
[01:49:06.206 --> 01:49:10.229]  Central Standard Time on all the InfoWare streams, and it'll be posted at Free World News.
[01:49:11.474 --> 01:49:13.135]  I'll add to what you're just saying.
[01:49:13.155 --> 01:49:17.117]  When I was uploading our episode on YouTube.com slash MichaelMilesOfficial,
[01:49:29.503 --> 01:49:47.948]  As soon as I put the title of the episode, which is, you know, Alex Jones, you know, episode whatever, it knows to demonetize and not give me the right to make money off of the video, even though it's making great numbers, just from the name Alex Jones, which is kind of ironic, because that's not an uncommon combination of words.
[01:49:48.228 --> 01:49:52.370]  You would think there's lots of people with that name that, like, they're wondering, why can't I monetize my video?
[01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:56.171]  Let's look at the film Brazil, based on a future police state, Terry Gilliam.
[01:49:57.452 --> 01:50:04.059]  The fly gets in the typewriter, changes the name by one letter, so that guy gets sent to a death camp, and then it causes a whole chain reaction.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.263]  Alex Jones is like John Smith.
[01:50:07.424 --> 01:50:12.209]  There are hundreds of thousands worldwide, at least tens of thousands, and they all get persecuted by the way because they have the same name.
[01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:15.133]  So it just shows how it's this ham-fisted authoritarian system.
[01:50:15.393 --> 01:50:24.519]  But it's also good that these authoritarian systems are ham-fisted because very quickly people can realize what these ham-fisted rules are and thanks to technology can navigate around them.
[01:50:24.759 --> 01:50:33.964]  You saw what happened earlier in the year when they tried to take down, I think it was Parler, and they did the best they could, but it was up and running not that long afterwards.
[01:50:34.685 --> 01:50:41.409]  And more importantly, there are enough people with technical expertise who are like, all right, these are the tactics they're going to use at some point in the future.
[01:50:41.769 --> 01:50:44.831]  What mechanisms can I use to route around them?
[01:50:45.111 --> 01:50:49.913]  So this is forcing innovation, and instead of their new dark age, this could trigger a new renaissance.
[01:50:49.933 --> 01:50:54.754]  Right, and the innovation is asymmetric because once something is invented, it can't be uninvented.
[01:50:54.874 --> 01:50:58.275]  Once those tools are in place, now they're going to have to work around it.
[01:50:58.295 --> 01:51:00.216]  And explain asymmetric for folks that may not know.
[01:51:00.316 --> 01:51:03.138]  Well sure, it's just the kind of thing where it's not equal on both sides.
[01:51:03.158 --> 01:51:04.259]  And let me give you one example.
[01:51:04.279 --> 01:51:12.587]  Like if we're cavemen and we're hitting each other over the head with sticks, and I somehow invent a gun, you can't go back.
[01:51:12.887 --> 01:51:13.247]  It's a lot...
[01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:17.010]  I think so.
[01:51:32.624 --> 01:51:36.446]  30 years ago, people said sarcastically, oh, you don't like it?
[01:51:36.707 --> 01:51:37.867]  Build your own website.
[01:51:38.207 --> 01:51:43.610]  Now there's many outlets where for free or for cheap, you can have a website up and running.
[01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:50.534]  And now we see big tech and even the governor of Texas lobbying to shut down Gab because Gab is like what Facebook was three years ago.
[01:51:50.774 --> 01:51:55.477]  As long as you don't commit a crime and don't say kill somebody or deal drugs, you're allowed to be there.
[01:51:55.897 --> 01:51:58.879]  Andrew Torb is not a white supremacist, but they're calling one and want him shut down.
[01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.520]  But the thing is, this is the point.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.740]  They are lobbying to have this happen.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:07.681]  If they had the power and the will to do it, they would have done it.
[01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:20.024]  So you always have to assume that there are people, whoever you're thinking about, who are going to want to deprive you of your freedoms and liberties, and you have to not engage with them necessarily, because there's going to be somebody else who has these cockamamie ideas.
[01:52:20.324 --> 01:52:22.425]  But that's my question, because I've already been deplatformed.
[01:52:22.445 --> 01:52:23.105]  One second, one second.
[01:52:23.305 --> 01:52:26.786]  But put mechanisms in place so they can't put their BS over on you.
[01:52:26.806 --> 01:52:27.267]  Sorry, Alex.
[01:52:27.347 --> 01:52:27.827]  No, I agree.
[01:52:27.847 --> 01:52:29.027]  So what are the mechanisms?
[01:52:29.828 --> 01:52:33.989]  We have the Democratic Party suing me, trying to find out what banks we use.
[01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.510]  Yeah.
[01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:36.871]  I mean, these depositions, they don't ask me about the stuff they're suing for.
[01:52:36.911 --> 01:52:38.191]  It's like, what are your bank accounts?
[01:52:38.371 --> 01:52:39.252]  How do we shut you down?
[01:52:39.432 --> 01:52:40.612]  How do we shut your satellites off?
[01:52:40.652 --> 01:52:45.634]  I mean, it's literally just scrabbling to try to harass anybody we do business with.
[01:52:46.135 --> 01:52:46.895]  Very Hitlerian.
[01:52:47.355 --> 01:53:04.321]  Well, also, they're just going to keep... I mean, our legal system is designed, and this is another reason I'm an anarchist, to basically bleed people dry and have a draw for years and never actually get to a resolution to make sure that people are paying lawyers out the wazoo and just basically having motion after motion.
[01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:09.363]  If someone is wealthy enough, they can drive you into bankruptcy just for filing motions and motions.
[01:53:09.383 --> 01:53:10.603]  You're going to have to pay your lawyers.
[01:53:11.003 --> 01:53:12.504]  It's a really disturbing system.
[01:53:13.224 --> 01:53:16.807]  Hopefully people will be more receptive to having free market alternatives to the legal system.
[01:53:16.847 --> 01:53:32.300]  Well, I'm one of the only people, and you as well, that we're on air and we've seen the democratization of information because of this that really scares the system that I can keep doing my show forever and not even get paid, so at a certain point there's nothing they can do to stop me but kill me.
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:39.745]  What I want to do, what I want to ask you about is, I think in recent years you were on Rogan recently and he's been standing up for you pretty hardcore.
[01:53:40.065 --> 01:53:41.786]  Andrew Schultz, you did his show, you did mine.
[01:53:42.106 --> 01:53:48.491]  Do you think that you were seeing a kind of, they did everything they could to kind of wipe you off the planet and take you off the internet.
[01:53:48.771 --> 01:53:55.475]  Are you seeing a bit of a rehabilitation where you're not being regarded as this Antichrist figure and more of someone who's like, okay, maybe he's a little weird?
[01:53:56.236 --> 01:53:57.257]  I want to say this.
[01:53:57.657 --> 01:54:02.300]  I don't want to thank my lucky stars, Lister supporting us, you know, everything that's happened, but
[01:54:04.641 --> 01:54:14.543]  I have seen the process I've been through make a lot of people that weren't paying attention actually hear what we're actually doing, and then they see what the media says we're doing versus what we actually do, and people get really mad about it.
[01:54:14.923 --> 01:54:29.507]  And so, I almost want to say it's more of a cause celeb now, pretty avant-garde, cutting edge, and in fact, to the point of it, I never even imagined that or tried that, but in intellectual circles, that's basically what's happened now.
[01:54:31.067 --> 01:54:33.088]  Two levels, I don't think I even deserve sometimes.
[01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.970]  So I've really hit a very special spot.
[01:54:36.370 --> 01:54:40.392]  And what's happening is, is all these things we predicted come true, just in all the white papers, it's not hard.
[01:54:41.052 --> 01:54:44.434]  You know, predictance, it's like a restaurant has the thing on a menu, you order the food, it comes.
[01:54:44.474 --> 01:54:46.815]  I mean, they've got a menu of tyranny, an agenda.
[01:54:47.295 --> 01:54:50.937]  So as all this stuff happens, I said was happening, it's reached stratospheric.
[01:54:50.957 --> 01:54:52.318]  I went and got my haircut yesterday.
[01:54:52.958 --> 01:54:53.098]  I don't
[01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:11.371]  It's blown up in their face, quite frankly.
[01:55:11.952 --> 01:55:24.140]  Even assuming everything it said about you that is nefarious is true, you're not the one telling people like in Canada to quarantine children in their own room, lock them in a door for two weeks, they can't hug or see mom or dad.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:29.784]  You're not the one telling people in Belgium to get cops on the back of horseback and clubbing old men.
[01:55:29.824 --> 01:55:30.805]  You can look this up on the internet.
[01:55:30.825 --> 01:55:31.185]  And women!
[01:55:31.365 --> 01:55:34.708]  And women in the head making them bloody because they're in a park.
[01:55:35.068 --> 01:55:41.474]  Is there any better example of a free... Clydesdale horses running women over in England almost killed the woman.
[01:55:41.635 --> 01:55:42.876]  I did not see that one.
[01:55:42.916 --> 01:55:44.257]  And this is all a Milgram experiment.
[01:55:44.597 --> 01:55:46.459]  Yes, yes, because this is what happened.
[01:55:46.499 --> 01:55:47.100]  World War I...
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:51.541]  Uh, Washington took over the entire country to fight the Great War.
[01:55:51.621 --> 01:55:52.942]  You can understand why they have to do that.
[01:55:52.962 --> 01:55:53.722]  This is a huge war.
[01:55:54.042 --> 01:56:03.165]  But then, uh, 15 years later, when you had FDR, he said, look, we did all this already during the Great War, and now it's the Great Depression, which is a far bigger threat to America than the Kaiser.
[01:56:03.425 --> 01:56:05.145]  We're going to take over the entire country again.
[01:56:05.405 --> 01:56:06.826]  So I tweeted this out before.
[01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:16.429]  There are a lot of people, for better or for worse, regardless of what you think of COVID, had some very useful information about what Americans and people around the world are going to put up with from the state and from the corporate media.
[01:56:16.989 --> 01:56:27.076]  And if you go after World War I, basically the precursor of the FBI staged bombings, provocateured anarchists, as a pretext for the national police force we now have.
[01:56:27.336 --> 01:56:30.919]  Yeah, so many things were put into place.
[01:56:31.839 --> 01:56:38.464]  Can anyone listening to this tell me with a straight face that it's impossible that they're going to say you have to stay in your home and not work to fight climate change?
[01:56:38.724 --> 01:56:40.045]  You can imagine it being said right now.
[01:56:40.065 --> 01:56:40.745]  They're already saying it.
[01:56:40.765 --> 01:56:41.746]  They want climate lockdowns.
[01:56:42.506 --> 01:56:43.147]  I didn't even know that.
[01:56:43.787 --> 01:56:44.248]  That's the thing.
[01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:45.408]  You're not Nostradamus.
[01:56:45.448 --> 01:56:46.929]  It's like these people aren't that clever.
[01:56:47.169 --> 01:56:57.476]  You know if they say ABC, they're going to say... Well, that's what's frustrating is that it is every tool book of a tyrant to cartoon level.
[01:56:57.716 --> 01:56:59.457]  I mean, they're like throwing everything they've got.
[01:56:59.737 --> 01:57:03.480]  Yeah, and maybe that's why Kamala Harris is laughing so much because it's all a cartoon to her.
[01:57:05.034 --> 01:57:20.483]  It really is crazy, because like you said... But the thing is, and here's what people need to appreciate, they have, Ayn Rand, who's a great writer that everyone should be familiar with, she was on Donahue in 1979, you can look at the clip on YouTube, and he says to her, why are you so contemptuous of these people?
[01:57:20.543 --> 01:57:22.444]  Why don't you just say, I disagree?
[01:57:22.524 --> 01:57:28.307]  And she goes, because I look at them, because they don't hesitate to sacrifice entire nations.
[01:57:28.648 --> 01:57:32.710]  They are perfectly fine, the crown jewels of New York, of America, excuse me,
[01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:38.012]  Oh, you moved to New York, you go to L.A., Hollywood, and look what they've done!
[01:57:38.373 --> 01:57:45.236]  They don't care if they take out things that are of value even to them, just as long as they maintain their hold on power.
[01:57:45.456 --> 01:57:47.117]  Because if they don't have their power, what are they going to have?
[01:57:47.157 --> 01:57:48.578]  They're not going to be charming and effusive.
[01:57:48.598 --> 01:57:49.378]  It's scorched earth.
[01:57:49.398 --> 01:57:52.419]  Let's talk about scorched earth when we come back with Michael Malice.
[01:57:52.439 --> 01:57:52.860]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:53.260]  Thank you.
[01:57:54.369 --> 01:57:56.631]  Michael Malice and his crew are here with us.
[01:57:56.651 --> 01:58:00.434]  They'll be on with me tomorrow on a special transmission that airs at 4 p.m.
[01:58:00.474 --> 01:58:05.517]  Central at Infowars.com forward slash show and welcome to all our radio stations and TV stations.
[01:58:05.838 --> 01:58:08.500]  We'd like to pick it up off the satellite on top of the roof, the satellite uplink.
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.703]  Michael Malice is here with us for this little segment and one more and then we've got Stu Peters taking over.
[01:58:13.724 --> 01:58:18.087]  Always does a great job in the fourth hour on Friday ahead of Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[01:58:18.467 --> 01:58:19.528]  And that is at 3 p.m.
[01:58:19.588 --> 01:58:20.809]  Central Time today.
[01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:22.451]  Weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:58:22.511 --> 01:58:26.115]  We have Harrison Smith and American Journal as well.
[01:58:26.155 --> 01:58:28.717]  Please don't forget, this weekend is the last
[01:58:31.775 --> 01:58:32.015]  Time
[01:58:54.690 --> 01:58:54.950]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:09.687 --> 01:59:11.367]  We are funded by you, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:11.427 --> 01:59:15.268]  Get a book and a t-shirt while you're at it as well because certainly we've proven InfoWars is changing the debate worldwide.
[01:59:37.774 --> 01:59:39.474]  Really giving the globalists a run for their money.
[01:59:39.815 --> 01:59:41.195]  And that's all thanks to your support.
[01:59:41.215 --> 01:59:41.815]  So thank you so much.
[01:59:42.075 --> 01:59:43.856]  Michael Malice, I've been asked a lot of questions.
[01:59:43.916 --> 01:59:45.256]  You got a lot of places you want to go.
[01:59:45.936 --> 01:59:47.216]  What else is on your radar?
[01:59:47.617 --> 01:59:49.837]  What else are you wanting to impart to the planet?
[01:59:50.877 --> 01:59:55.799]  I'm curious what you think is going to happen with Trump's lawsuit and if you think he's got a shot.
[01:59:55.839 --> 01:59:56.759]  I'm sure you talked about it.
[01:59:57.199 --> 01:59:59.081]  The legal system is obviously very complicated.
[01:59:59.401 --> 02:00:00.342]  You know, you're not an attorney.
[02:00:01.463 --> 02:00:04.505]  But do you think this is something that is going to have legs?
[02:00:04.945 --> 02:00:11.430]  And maybe it has legs in terms of not just legal, in terms of legal success, but in terms of galvanizing people and having them have a different perspective.
[02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:12.191]  What do you think about that?
[02:00:12.391 --> 02:00:16.154]  I've been sued more than 40 times by the Democrats to try to bankrupt us and shut us down.
[02:00:16.594 --> 02:00:18.956]  We've gotten 34 of them thrown out.
[02:00:19.237 --> 02:00:19.957]  Oh, wow.
[02:00:20.137 --> 02:00:23.660]  But I mean, we're talking the folks that bankrupted Remington.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.461]  That's just coming after me.
[02:00:25.341 --> 02:00:26.401]  But did you see what just happened?
[02:00:26.602 --> 02:00:35.684]  They sued Remington and as a response they gave him like 10,000 memes that were just complete jokes that had nothing to do with it because Remington's like, what do we have to do with the shooting?
[02:00:36.404 --> 02:00:37.885]  That's not how the legal system works.
[02:00:38.065 --> 02:00:39.645]  Yeah, they said give us, it's the same law firm.
[02:00:39.845 --> 02:00:40.065]  Yeah.
[02:00:40.105 --> 02:00:40.986]  Koskoff and Koskoff.
[02:00:41.006 --> 02:00:43.126]  They said, Senator Blumenthal basically runs it.
[02:00:43.746 --> 02:00:47.308]  And they said, they say to us, they go, give us the Sandy Hook marketing.
[02:00:48.188 --> 02:00:49.868]  And I go, there isn't any marketing.
[02:00:49.888 --> 02:00:51.049]  Do we have a marketing meeting before this?
[02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.329]  No sir.
[02:00:53.206 --> 02:00:55.407]  I mean, you said, seriously, I've got an underwear line now.
[02:00:55.967 --> 02:00:56.387]  That was it.
[02:00:56.927 --> 02:00:58.368]  So the marketing meeting was about your underwear.
[02:00:58.748 --> 02:00:59.768]  I mean, seriously, folks.
[02:01:00.028 --> 02:01:01.929]  But see, they're also calculated.
[02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:04.590]  They think we're up here, like, masterminding everything.
[02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:16.454]  Well, I think a lot of that is projection, because so much of what people don't appreciate is what is presented as fact by the corporate press is, in reality, a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant people in power.
[02:01:16.714 --> 02:01:18.955]  So by the time you're seeing it on some kind of network,
[02:01:19.615 --> 02:01:20.555]  There's been a lot of meetings.
[02:01:20.575 --> 02:01:21.376]  There's a lot of producers.
[02:01:21.396 --> 02:01:23.797]  They're like, what message, what narrative do we want to put forward?
[02:01:24.037 --> 02:01:26.878]  Which is why you're going to have the same message across different outlets.
[02:01:27.698 --> 02:01:31.480]  But that, so they assume everyone else is going to do the same kind of product.
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:32.000]  And that's it.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:35.461]  And it's the average globalist running things is about 80 years old.
[02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:37.162]  They don't get how things work.
[02:01:37.702 --> 02:01:40.143]  I had a judge once say, what is a meme?
[02:01:41.408 --> 02:01:52.811]  And I said it's like a joke, it's like a cartoon, it's like a way to express something, not using words sometimes, an image, it's a shared... That is the most boomer definition of a meme I've ever heard!
[02:01:53.651 --> 02:01:54.351]  What would you call a meme?
[02:01:54.731 --> 02:01:58.952]  A meme is an image with captions on it that has a comedic effect.
[02:01:59.633 --> 02:02:01.653]  Or some other emotional effect.
[02:02:01.813 --> 02:02:04.594]  Am I a boomer?
[02:02:05.174 --> 02:02:06.954]  You are totally a boomer, Alex!
[02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:11.132]  Sorry, okay.
[02:02:11.152 --> 02:02:11.692]  You're a boomer.
[02:02:12.212 --> 02:02:13.613]  I'm not a boomer, I know what a meme is!
[02:02:15.374 --> 02:02:16.214]  I know what a meme is.
[02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:18.536]  Do you put two spaces after a period when you type?
[02:02:19.937 --> 02:02:20.097]  No.
[02:02:20.437 --> 02:02:21.137]  Then you're not a boomer.
[02:02:21.838 --> 02:02:23.358]  Okay, let me explain what I'm saying.
[02:02:23.378 --> 02:02:26.020]  A meme is whatever you want it to be.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.121]  And a meme is something people share.
[02:02:28.481 --> 02:02:28.701]  Yes.
[02:02:29.982 --> 02:02:32.043]  To me, it's like graffiti on the Roman walls.
[02:02:32.083 --> 02:02:33.144]  But it has a certain structure.
[02:02:33.164 --> 02:02:34.705]  It's a picture with a caption on it.
[02:02:34.765 --> 02:02:35.325]  That is a meme.
[02:02:36.366 --> 02:02:37.026]  What is this meme?
[02:02:37.066 --> 02:02:38.107]  I like this meme of Joe Rugger.
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:39.900]  Is that a meme?
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:40.721]  Who's that with him?
[02:02:40.921 --> 02:02:41.881]  I don't know why they put it up.
[02:02:41.981 --> 02:02:42.741]  I just, I like it.
[02:02:43.101 --> 02:02:44.162]  I don't know who that is on the right.
[02:02:44.362 --> 02:02:46.483]  That's, uh, that's the original podcaster.
[02:02:46.843 --> 02:02:47.623]  Oh, okay.
[02:02:47.783 --> 02:02:49.044]  Oh, is that, uh, Adam Curry?
[02:02:49.164 --> 02:02:49.324]  Yep.
[02:02:49.544 --> 02:02:50.944]  I just had him on my show a couple weeks ago.
[02:02:50.964 --> 02:02:51.505]  I love Adam.
[02:02:51.525 --> 02:02:52.005]  He was here.
[02:02:52.265 --> 02:02:52.725]  I love Adam.
[02:02:52.745 --> 02:02:53.726]  He's been on the show many times.
[02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:54.346]  He's a smart dude.
[02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:58.507]  But then his Patreon people or whatever said, if you ever go back on his show, boy, you're finished.
[02:02:58.807 --> 02:02:59.208]  Oh, geez.
[02:02:59.248 --> 02:03:01.949]  So he won't even talk to me unless it's secretly over the fence.
[02:03:02.509 --> 02:03:04.890]  Well, I mean... But it's kind of cool to be that black sheep.
[02:03:05.788 --> 02:03:07.809]  Yeah, but I mean... He did defend me on the show, by the way.
[02:03:07.829 --> 02:03:08.529]  I'm not attacking Adam Curry.
[02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.989]  No, no, no.
[02:03:09.249 --> 02:03:11.410]  I mean, Rubin has a site called Locals.
[02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:13.111]  I'm on malice.locals.com.
[02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:21.615]  I find a better alternative, Patreon, because what I didn't like about Patreon, there was lawsuits, is overnight you could be vanished and your entire income is destroyed, and a lot of people have seen that happen.
[02:03:22.686 --> 02:03:23.387]  Without any warning.
[02:03:23.887 --> 02:03:28.432]  Well, I just want my enemies to know that I'm going to continue on no matter how many lawsuits they file.
[02:03:28.912 --> 02:03:30.113]  And you're not going to kill yourself.
[02:03:30.754 --> 02:03:31.535]  And I'm not going to kill myself.
[02:03:31.575 --> 02:03:32.335]  Okay, let's continue.
[02:03:32.896 --> 02:03:34.938]  So what do you, how do you think Biden's going to end?
[02:03:34.958 --> 02:03:39.022]  Because there's so many videos, I can't even play them, new ones of him not even knowing what planet he's on.
[02:03:39.282 --> 02:03:44.146]  It's definitely, you watch him in the debate, he had a few problems, clearly had some cognitive decline.
[02:03:44.467 --> 02:03:45.528]  He is on another planet now.
[02:03:46.028 --> 02:03:56.517]  Uh, I'm looking for- I really, really hope, as someone who's a troll and appreciates the humorous and absurd in life, that he does run in 2024, because at that point he'd be literally disintegrating and be watching his jaw fall off.
[02:03:56.957 --> 02:03:59.319]  Uh, it'll be like some- And they'll keep saying, oh what a genius!
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.460]  Did you see his State of the Union?
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.242]  No, they'll say his jaw fell off because of Trump!
[02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:03.042]  Exactly.
[02:04:03.743 --> 02:04:03.983]  Right.
[02:04:04.103 --> 02:04:06.204]  Did you see a State of the Union, which they called something else?
[02:04:06.625 --> 02:04:12.668]  And they literally, we had a compilation going, the baritone in that voice, the delivery, no one has ever been a speaker this good.
[02:04:12.728 --> 02:04:14.489]  He is the greatest speaker in history.
[02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:16.550]  It was like, it was like cartoonish what they're saying.
[02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:24.014]  But the thing is, they have to do this because who are you going to believe, your own lying eyes or, you know, the folks over at MSNBC?
[02:04:24.754 --> 02:04:35.762]  They put him in, they dragged his carcass over the finish line, and now it's their job to maintain this kind of semblance of authority and decency, whereas anyone who looks at it for two seconds, I feel bad for the guy.
[02:04:35.842 --> 02:04:39.324]  I don't think, as far as politicians go, he's a particularly evil one.
[02:04:39.564 --> 02:04:42.747]  There's some really, really malevolent authoritarians out there.
[02:04:43.027 --> 02:04:45.228]  I think he's just a party hack of the Democratic Party.
[02:04:45.248 --> 02:04:45.969]  He just wants money!
[02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:47.491]  Yeah, it has been.
[02:04:47.511 --> 02:04:48.752]  He's a placeholder, though, for bad people.
[02:04:48.772 --> 02:04:50.655]  He's a placeholder for bad people, exactly.
[02:04:50.755 --> 02:04:55.601]  I mean, when people tell me that they think he's a Marxist, this guy doesn't have any political philosophy of his own whatsoever.
[02:04:55.861 --> 02:04:56.862]  He's just there to be a reminder.
[02:04:56.902 --> 02:04:58.504]  He's a corrupt ambulance-chasing lawyer.
[02:04:58.584 --> 02:04:59.646]  Yes, exactly.
[02:04:59.966 --> 02:05:03.330]  And frankly, I'd rather have that than someone who's an ideologue and authoritarian.
[02:05:04.195 --> 02:05:04.956]  Let me ask you this.
[02:05:04.976 --> 02:05:05.376]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:06.797 --> 02:05:09.238]  What is the left doing with their critical race theory and all this?
[02:05:09.258 --> 02:05:10.319]  I mean, we know what they're doing.
[02:05:10.359 --> 02:05:14.342]  They're declaring all their enemies and anything they haven't conquered racist so they can get rid of it.
[02:05:14.382 --> 02:05:17.764]  But denial of evolution is a form of white supremacy.
[02:05:17.944 --> 02:05:18.324]  OK.
[02:05:19.365 --> 02:05:20.986]  Birdwatching is white supremacy.
[02:05:21.026 --> 02:05:22.807]  French cuisine is white supremacy.
[02:05:22.827 --> 02:05:27.990]  I mean, I mean, again, it's reached absurdist levels and it's only getting worse.
[02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:28.811]  What is happening here?
[02:05:29.011 --> 02:05:40.305]  Because if you have a useful tool, right, and no one wants to be called a white supremacist, this is absolutely a horrible position that, you know, all decent people don't even think about, let alone, you know, countenance for a second.
[02:05:40.786 --> 02:05:45.352]  If I can persuade people that this is white supremacist, I don't have to have an argument about it.
[02:05:45.712 --> 02:05:50.033]  And this has been an effective tool for a long time, but now it's reached the point where it's just frothing at the mouth.
[02:05:50.053 --> 02:05:52.894]  So it's beyond calling somebody a conspiracy terrorist, meaning I don't want to debate you.
[02:05:52.914 --> 02:05:53.795]  It's just, oh, you're just a racist.
[02:05:54.075 --> 02:05:56.095]  Well, it's not just racist.
[02:05:56.155 --> 02:05:57.576]  They tried racist for a long time.
[02:05:57.656 --> 02:05:58.176]  It didn't work.
[02:05:58.216 --> 02:05:58.976]  Trump got elected.
[02:05:58.996 --> 02:06:00.597]  So then I have to escalate the notch.
[02:06:00.877 --> 02:06:05.939]  The reason why it's absurd is a lot of us will often have something that there may be accidentally racist.
[02:06:05.959 --> 02:06:09.140]  Like if you have someone who's an immigrant, you might say something offensive to their culture.
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:10.160]  And we don't want to do that, right?
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:14.464]  But at the same time, no one is worried that they're a closet white supremacist.
[02:06:14.725 --> 02:06:17.788]  No one goes to bed is accidentally going to be a member of the Klan.
[02:06:17.828 --> 02:06:20.110]  This is something that takes intent and it takes an ideology.
[02:06:20.190 --> 02:06:21.272]  It's like Monty Python.
[02:06:21.292 --> 02:06:23.414]  The French are the Spanish Inquisition!
[02:06:26.292 --> 02:06:32.677]  Yeah, the point being, like, at a certain point, you were speaking earlier to why they're losing, these are not effective tools.
[02:06:32.837 --> 02:06:37.461]  It is effective to say, hey, when you do X, Y, and Z, you're offending people, you shouldn't do it.
[02:06:37.761 --> 02:06:40.283]  All of us would listen, like, I don't want to offend people, I want to be a nice guy.
[02:06:40.543 --> 02:06:50.070]  If you tell people, if you like this Autobahn, then you're a white supremacist, at that point, it's like, we're not even having a conversation, because that's not even a hypothesis I'm going to take seriously for one moment.
[02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:51.171]  And you just said it.
[02:06:51.432 --> 02:06:53.995]  Calling everyone racist didn't work, so they just turned it up to 11.
[02:06:54.616 --> 02:06:54.876]  Right.
[02:06:55.336 --> 02:06:56.077]  Right, exactly.
[02:06:56.117 --> 02:06:58.180]  And it's just like, no one is a crypto-Nazi.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:02.626]  No one is at home secretly wanting Anne Frank to be murdered, other than literal Nazis.
[02:07:02.646 --> 02:07:06.430]  This is not a concern that, especially in this country, people are worried about.
[02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:09.893]  You know, I know a lot of folks at Immigrant Information Europe.
[02:07:09.933 --> 02:07:11.794]  I can't tell you Immigrant Information Europe.
[02:07:11.814 --> 02:07:12.374]  How young were you?
[02:07:12.454 --> 02:07:16.216]  I was two, but we spoke Russian at home, so English is my second language, so cut me some slack.
[02:07:16.656 --> 02:07:18.017]  We finally got a Russian!
[02:07:18.777 --> 02:07:19.598]  Russian collusion!
[02:07:20.058 --> 02:07:20.978]  I'm a Russian troll.
[02:07:20.999 --> 02:07:21.639]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:07:21.679 --> 02:07:22.179]  It's happening.
[02:07:22.559 --> 02:07:23.140]  So they're right.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.661]  We're conspiring.
[02:07:25.041 --> 02:07:26.803]  Oh my gosh, I finally found one.
[02:07:26.823 --> 02:07:28.124]  Hold on, Putin's in the earpiece.
[02:07:28.224 --> 02:07:28.784]  What's he saying?
[02:07:28.845 --> 02:07:29.685]  Assassinate Alex?
[02:07:29.885 --> 02:07:30.646]  He's a good guy.
[02:07:30.686 --> 02:07:31.987]  I'm not going to do it, Uncle Vlad.
[02:07:32.328 --> 02:07:32.708]  Exactly.
[02:07:32.748 --> 02:07:35.991]  Well, what do you make of what Russia's doing with its Christian nationalism?
[02:07:36.011 --> 02:07:37.352]  A lot of folks think, oh, that's fake.
[02:07:37.692 --> 02:07:39.054]  I mean, I know a lot of people that live in Russia.
[02:07:39.074 --> 02:07:39.594]  I've talked to them.
[02:07:39.874 --> 02:07:40.795]  They say that it's 100% real.
[02:07:41.696 --> 02:07:44.837]  Yeah, I'm not that informed about what's going on in the boots of the ground in Russia.
[02:07:45.117 --> 02:07:46.378]  You're not getting orders from Putin?
[02:07:46.598 --> 02:07:47.839]  I didn't say that.
[02:07:48.279 --> 02:07:48.879]  I've said too much.
[02:07:49.319 --> 02:07:58.383]  I was supposed to go there for two years in a row for my birthday with my buddy Chris, who's another podcaster, to just see where I came from and that has not been able to happen.
[02:07:58.423 --> 02:07:59.583]  We should go to Russia together!
[02:08:00.064 --> 02:08:00.684]  Would you be able to go?
[02:08:01.024 --> 02:08:07.448]  Well, I mean, I got like two years ago, I was going to go to make a joke about the Russiagate stuff three years ago, and then they gave me the visa.
[02:08:07.829 --> 02:08:10.771]  But then they indicted Roger Stone and he goes, dude, this isn't a joke.
[02:08:10.811 --> 02:08:11.451]  I wouldn't make a joke.
[02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:13.212]  OK, so I was like, I'm not going to go now.
[02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:15.254]  But now I do want to go now.
[02:08:15.394 --> 02:08:17.355]  I want to go to Russia with Michael Malice.
[02:08:17.395 --> 02:08:17.856]  We'll be right back.
[02:08:18.905 --> 02:08:22.486]  Final segment with Michael Malice ahead of Stu Peters taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:08:22.506 --> 02:08:24.407]  We're going to be back tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:08:24.427 --> 02:08:27.188]  Central, commercial-free for at least an hour.
[02:08:27.268 --> 02:08:28.309]  It's going to be powerful.
[02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:30.970]  Some of the other big news on Infowars.com.
[02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:32.570]  I know Owen Schroer will be covering in an hour.
[02:08:33.331 --> 02:08:35.952]  Body cam footage shows a moment cops rescue six-year-old
[02:08:36.832 --> 02:08:38.613]  Girl snatched off bike by kidnapper.
[02:08:38.633 --> 02:08:41.395]  We're going to talk about the police in that situation.
[02:08:42.156 --> 02:08:43.497]  God bless abortions.
[02:08:43.877 --> 02:08:47.660]  God bless abortions draped across Christ the Ozark statue in Arkansas.
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:53.744]  We have Democrats and leftists defacing Christian icons and burning churches down all over the world.
[02:08:53.784 --> 02:08:59.167]  We'll talk about that with Michael Malice and why I think that's happening coming up in the interview tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:08:59.207 --> 02:09:00.348]  Central at Infowars.com.
[02:09:00.368 --> 02:09:03.010]  But in the four minutes we have left, it's great to have you here.
[02:09:04.531 --> 02:09:11.476]  Give us a prelude to tomorrow's show, Saturday's show, about a Russian's perspective on what's happening in America.
[02:09:11.516 --> 02:09:25.986]  Yeah, this is something I think, you know, when you're born in another country and you're raised in a certain household, I bring it up a lot in interviews and people kind of tease me about it, but I think it's germane because when you're not trained from an early age to take certain things at face value, you never learn them.
[02:09:26.006 --> 02:09:29.548]  There's a reason why it's so important for people like Kamala Harris.
[02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:31.510]  Joe Biden just had a proposal
[02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:36.513]  I think it was yesterday, trying to extend education for free to a community college.
[02:09:36.813 --> 02:09:39.075]  So they'll have you by the time you're what, three?
[02:09:39.455 --> 02:09:43.798]  Until you're 21 to train you and educate you and punish you if you step out of line.
[02:09:43.818 --> 02:09:48.321]  The point of government schools is to break young spirits and make people submissive and docile to authority.
[02:09:48.741 --> 02:09:56.927]  When you are coming from a different culture, when you're raised, you know, to have this kind of skepticism, many things that Americans, and I'm not saying this to insult Americans at all,
[02:09:57.267 --> 02:09:58.609]  We're not as free as we think we are.
[02:09:58.749 --> 02:09:58.989]  Right.
[02:09:59.269 --> 02:10:09.260]  And also we take things as a given that are perceived to be true, but if someone was never raised in that, you just sit there, you're like, how can you think for a second that this is something that is the case?
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:14.606]  Or maybe you think it's bad, but you don't appreciate just how bad and pervasive it is.
[02:10:15.087 --> 02:10:16.048]  It's like circumcision.
[02:10:16.428 --> 02:10:19.250]  Like, I'm against Muslims cutting the clitorises off of little girls.
[02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:20.630]  People go, hey, what about circumcision?
[02:10:20.650 --> 02:10:21.531]  It's like, it's true.
[02:10:21.571 --> 02:10:24.132]  Like, why do I have a Jewish ritual?
[02:10:24.152 --> 02:10:26.013]  I mean, why is my penis Jewish?
[02:10:26.073 --> 02:10:27.114]  I mean, it's serious.
[02:10:27.134 --> 02:10:28.355]  Well, the Egyptians invented it.
[02:10:28.415 --> 02:10:31.136]  So maybe you've got some kind of... I've got an Egyptian penis.
[02:10:31.296 --> 02:10:31.777]  Maybe.
[02:10:31.797 --> 02:10:32.097]  Why?
[02:10:32.237 --> 02:10:33.478]  Because it's all mummified?
[02:10:34.258 --> 02:10:35.019]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:35.319 --> 02:10:36.559]  Wrapped in bandages.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.921]  No, it's black.
[02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:39.621]  No more jokes.
[02:10:39.681 --> 02:10:40.201]  I shouldn't do it.
[02:10:40.241 --> 02:10:40.662]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:40.882 --> 02:10:42.062]  Apologize, family audience.
[02:10:42.283 --> 02:10:44.124]  No, but seriously, it's just... What?
[02:10:45.264 --> 02:10:46.265]  I love this.
[02:10:46.726 --> 02:10:47.466]  I love my life.
[02:10:47.646 --> 02:10:49.068]  This is what I get to do.
[02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:52.330]  And I can't wait to move to Austin and get the F out of New York.
[02:10:52.931 --> 02:10:53.932]  And never look back.
[02:10:53.992 --> 02:10:56.694]  It just hurts me so much to see what's happened to New York.
[02:10:56.754 --> 02:10:57.675]  It really, really hurts.
[02:10:57.695 --> 02:10:59.036]  Well, Austin's got its own problems.
[02:10:59.216 --> 02:11:00.997]  I'm not saying, but my people are here.
[02:11:01.118 --> 02:11:01.938]  Like all my friends are here.
[02:11:01.958 --> 02:11:02.819]  Well, it's more localized though.
[02:11:02.859 --> 02:11:03.299]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:03.339 --> 02:11:05.801]  And that's fine, but like it's... Like downtown Austin is like L.A.
[02:11:07.595 --> 02:11:11.517]  I thought they had that bill that they're gonna ban the public tents on the streets.
[02:11:11.537 --> 02:11:12.918]  They've cleaned up about 80% of it.
[02:11:13.038 --> 02:11:28.609]  Okay, so there's still 20%, but it's still, compared to New York and what's happened to it, it's just so... And here's the thing, I'm old enough to remember, when you have people start playing their music everywhere and you have the return of graffiti, violent assaults and home invasions are what's gonna happen next.
[02:11:28.929 --> 02:11:31.131]  And I'm very, very concerned about the future of New York.
[02:11:31.471 --> 02:11:36.132]  We'll talk about it tomorrow at 4 p.m., but hey, I love your shirt, because that's a meme.
[02:11:36.713 --> 02:11:38.233]  It's different connotations.
[02:11:38.253 --> 02:11:40.053]  You kind of project onto it what you're thinking.
[02:11:40.334 --> 02:11:41.614]  It's a provocative image.
[02:11:42.034 --> 02:11:44.395]  Yeah, and it's also, I just like the color scheme.
[02:11:45.755 --> 02:11:46.135]  Absolutely.
[02:11:46.175 --> 02:11:47.155]  I thought it fits well on me.
[02:11:47.316 --> 02:11:48.196]  I didn't know what to wear here.
[02:11:48.436 --> 02:11:51.137]  We're going to have you shoot a .357 Magnum Stubnose.
[02:11:51.157 --> 02:11:51.597]  Let's do it!
[02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:52.977]  Yeah, while wearing the shirt.
[02:11:53.757 --> 02:11:55.578]  In fact, tomorrow on the show, we'll get some guns out.
[02:11:56.235 --> 02:11:57.157]  Yeah, that'll be fun!
[02:11:57.237 --> 02:11:58.239]  We'll shoot him right here in the studio.
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:11:59.442]  I actually know the gun rules.
[02:11:59.462 --> 02:12:02.568]  You only point at something that you want to kill, assume every gun is loaded.
[02:12:02.588 --> 02:12:05.634]  I think there's a few others that even if you get them wrong, you're still going to be safe.
[02:12:06.536 --> 02:12:09.257]  Well, we're going to have some very, very fun times.
[02:12:09.357 --> 02:12:10.517]  We'll shoot full auto.
[02:12:10.858 --> 02:12:11.558]  I hate fun.
[02:12:11.918 --> 02:12:12.618]  I had fun once.
[02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:13.358]  It was terrible.
[02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:14.019]  Oh my God.
[02:12:14.639 --> 02:12:16.540]  What you do is you take DMT and mushrooms.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:17.960]  At the same time.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:20.681]  At the same time with machine guns.
[02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:21.781]  Everything's going to end up well.
[02:12:21.801 --> 02:12:23.582]  Bikini girls with machine guns.
[02:12:23.822 --> 02:12:24.362]  I'm joking.
[02:12:24.862 --> 02:12:25.363]  I'm joking.
[02:12:25.403 --> 02:12:26.063]  He's half joking.
[02:12:26.483 --> 02:12:28.124]  We've got some bikini girls we've got to take out tonight.
[02:12:28.524 --> 02:12:28.964]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:28.984 --> 02:12:30.084]  All right.
[02:12:30.244 --> 02:12:31.545]  Hey, Michael Malice.
[02:12:32.961 --> 02:12:36.327]  We got a big guest host coming up, Stu Peter, straight ahead, and then the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:12:36.347 --> 02:12:36.889]  Central, I'm sure.
[02:12:36.909 --> 02:12:38.411]  I'll be back tomorrow, 4 p.m.
[02:12:38.472 --> 02:12:39.093]  Love you all!
[02:12:39.794 --> 02:12:40.375]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:41.263 --> 02:12:42.744]  I just really look forward to Fridays.
[02:12:42.804 --> 02:12:43.965]  I appreciate being here.
[02:12:44.065 --> 02:12:45.145]  I love this audience.
[02:12:45.225 --> 02:12:51.869]  I get reached out to, I get emailed, DMs, people that watch, you know, this program, InfoWars, the Alex Jones Show, the whole thing.
[02:12:51.909 --> 02:12:58.833]  I mean, it's just, it is really humbling to have a platform like this and to be invited back here every Friday.
[02:12:58.853 --> 02:13:00.154]  I really enjoy it.
[02:13:00.174 --> 02:13:03.336]  So I just want, I want to start by saying that I love you guys.
[02:13:03.476 --> 02:13:04.777]  I really do appreciate
[02:13:05.397 --> 02:13:18.043]  All of the support that you have given and StuPeters.TV is really taking off and I believe a lot of that has to do with the fact that I come here and join you guys every Friday and it really is humbling to be accepted in your graces.
[02:13:18.803 --> 02:13:24.505]  I was having a thought earlier this morning and before I get to my guest, I just kind of want to relay this thought to you.
[02:13:25.426 --> 02:13:30.628]  With everything that is going on in Arizona, Arizona is so incredibly pivotal.
[02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:37.092]  And that is the reason why the attention is being distracted away from that by any means necessary.
[02:13:38.113 --> 02:13:52.359]  And now we're finding out that this weekend, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum and all of these globalist elitists that want to crush you, steal your freedom, stomp all over your individual liberty, tear apart the Constitution.
[02:13:52.679 --> 02:13:54.440]  And I'm not just talking about here in the United States.
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:14:00.122]  This is a global concerted effort to destroy any freedoms that any of our brothers and sisters have.
[02:14:00.828 --> 02:14:04.789]  This is not about black and white people or Christians versus Muslims.
[02:14:05.329 --> 02:14:06.290]  This is not about any of that.
[02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:07.230]  And they know that.
[02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:12.252]  They know that we recognize that we are so much more alike than we are different.
[02:14:13.352 --> 02:14:15.092]  And that we will band together.
[02:14:15.993 --> 02:14:16.953]  And when you combine...
[02:14:17.779 --> 02:14:30.725]  You know, having a platform like this, and I'm sure that Alex can appreciate this as well, when you have a platform, when you talk and interview guests, you get so many different life perspectives, different experts, people weigh in on experiences that they've had.
[02:14:31.485 --> 02:14:38.988]  And you develop this Rolodex of people and you hear these stories and you get emails constantly of people that are being victimized by this agenda.
[02:14:39.969 --> 02:14:42.610]  And you start to realize that this effort
[02:14:43.763 --> 02:14:56.469]  Is so overwhelmingly planned and is being so carefully implemented, but you recognize also that there is this huge panic going on as everything hits at one time, and it's not a coincidence, and there are no coincidences.
[02:14:57.029 --> 02:15:12.917]  It's no coincidence that a mass exodus is happening amongst our great cops while all these democratically controlled major cities across America burn, that there's an insurgency happening, and you know, in Los Angeles we just saw this morning that a guy is climbing to the top of a church to light the cross on fire.
[02:15:13.417 --> 02:15:25.666]  I mean, these things are happening on the streets of America that we would have never imagined happening all the while this pandemic, this control of virus, you know, and their war gaming over the weekend right now in Germany.
[02:15:26.166 --> 02:15:36.353]  Starting today, Klaus Schwab and this World Economic Forum are apparently meeting about the next thing that they are going to do, which apparently is going to dwarf the whole COVID-19 plan.
[02:15:38.455 --> 02:15:41.597]  It's just it's absolutely mind boggling to me that
[02:15:42.945 --> 02:15:48.427]  When you look at a population like the Amish, for example, why don't the Amish have a COVID-19 problem?
[02:15:48.467 --> 02:15:49.527]  Because they don't have a TV!
[02:15:49.547 --> 02:16:00.531]  They have not been indoctrinated by this PSYOP, this plan, and it's so incredibly frustrating to hear the stories of these victims.
[02:16:02.822 --> 02:16:16.285]  And then to look around and see the potential that we have, knowing that we are a giant country, we are a huge country in so many ways, not just numbers, but in so many ways we are, we're the only superpower that remains on the planet.
[02:16:17.866 --> 02:16:19.826]  And there are so many paths to victory.
[02:16:20.307 --> 02:16:21.907]  There are so many easy wins.
[02:16:22.958 --> 02:16:24.960]  And those winds begin in Arizona.
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:27.842]  And I don't want you to take your eyes off of Arizona.
[02:16:27.922 --> 02:16:33.326]  Arizona could quite possibly be the answer to saving our constitutional republic.
[02:16:35.628 --> 02:16:38.790]  But the victim stories we have to stay on because these people need a voice.
[02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:42.493]  And my guest today is Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:16:44.054 --> 02:16:52.661]  Dr. Brian Artis is not only a doctor and a well-qualified expert, but he's also the son-in-law of his deceased father-in-law.
[02:16:53.533 --> 02:17:01.576]  Who died because of ill-advised hospital protocols, which after hearing his story, I don't call it ill-advised hospital protocols, I call it murder.
[02:17:02.016 --> 02:17:02.696]  Intentional murder.
[02:17:03.317 --> 02:17:10.459]  He's done the most patriotic thing that any person could do, which is to take that pain and then transform it into action.
[02:17:10.919 --> 02:17:13.901]  To take the loss and transform it into something good.
[02:17:14.041 --> 02:17:19.563]  To use that platform, to use that experience, to then gain a platform, rather, to be in front of you.
[02:17:19.603 --> 02:17:23.224]  Dr. Artis is out here exposing corruption in the medical system.
[02:17:24.198 --> 02:17:27.860]  He's exposing the elites that are trying to grab every last bit of power that they can.
[02:17:27.901 --> 02:17:34.425]  His focus is like ours, which is medical freedom, education, waking the world with truth.
[02:17:36.525 --> 02:17:37.185]  And he joins us now.
[02:17:37.246 --> 02:17:38.766]  Dr. Artis, thank you so much for being here.
[02:17:39.347 --> 02:17:51.714]  So in hoping to inform and hoping to inspire and hoping to empower those that are struggling with personal health issues and decisions amid the COVID-19 control virus, the rollout of these inoculations, they're being falsely referred to as vaccines.
[02:17:51.734 --> 02:17:55.377]  We're seeing unprecedented amounts of death and injury as a result of these things.
[02:17:56.097 --> 02:17:59.519]  Take us through your story and why you're here.
[02:17:59.599 --> 02:18:02.181]  Introduce yourself to the InfoWars audience.
[02:18:04.201 --> 02:18:05.442]  I'm Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:18:05.682 --> 02:18:08.903]  I have been a holistic healer, actually, since 2004.
[02:18:10.424 --> 02:18:21.249]  I was motivated to actually heal my sister who was incorrectly diagnosed as having what's called systemic lupus erythematosus when she was 11 years old and I was 21 years old.
[02:18:22.089 --> 02:18:25.531]  At the time, I was told and my family was told that my little sister
[02:18:26.345 --> 02:18:32.629]  Had a rare condition called systemic lupus erythematosus, which meant her body was now killing her.
[02:18:33.329 --> 02:18:35.751]  There is no known cause, no known cure.
[02:18:35.971 --> 02:18:49.899]  There's only these three treatment options, and these three treatment options are prednisone, methotrexate, and Plaquenil, which are three pharmaceutical drugs that she was going to have to live on for the rest of her life to try to suppress and minimize her symptoms.
[02:18:50.970 --> 02:18:57.775]  But this profession was absolutely admitting, and I recognized it right away, that they did not know how to figure out what caused her disease.
[02:18:58.075 --> 02:18:59.636]  They didn't know how to fix the disease.
[02:18:59.996 --> 02:19:02.017]  They just had these three treatment options they had to give her.
[02:19:02.858 --> 02:19:10.303]  My family was told these three drugs, over time, were going to destroy her liver and kidneys, and she would not live into her 40s.
[02:19:11.104 --> 02:19:15.787]  There was also side effects of stillbirths and birth defects in children while living on these drugs.
[02:19:16.167 --> 02:19:19.029]  So now my 11-year-old sister and my entire family were told,
[02:19:19.426 --> 02:19:22.107]  She would never be able to have a family of her own.
[02:19:23.008 --> 02:19:24.028]  She could not have children.
[02:19:24.869 --> 02:19:26.270]  My parents were very distraught.
[02:19:26.370 --> 02:19:27.270]  They started crying.
[02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:30.652]  They thought they heard that she was diagnosed with a terminal illness.
[02:19:31.152 --> 02:19:32.813]  She wasn't diagnosed with a terminal illness.
[02:19:33.273 --> 02:19:36.435]  This profession told me and my family, we don't know how to fix it.
[02:19:36.475 --> 02:19:37.415]  We don't know what's wrong with her.
[02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:38.456]  We just call it lupus.
[02:19:39.236 --> 02:19:40.837]  These three drugs are our only option.
[02:19:40.857 --> 02:19:45.039]  And by the way, in the next three decades, they will end her life and poison her to death.
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:47.921]  And the poisonous effects are going to keep her from having children.
[02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:58.716]  And I looked at my family then and I said, just because this medical profession doesn't know how to figure out what happened to her three months ago to make her entire body hurt, doesn't mean that someone doesn't.
[02:19:59.497 --> 02:20:05.561]  So if I can't find another profession to tell us what's wrong with her, I will figure out what happened to her to make her hurt.
[02:20:06.421 --> 02:20:09.243]  It just made sense to me that there was a cause and effect.
[02:20:09.343 --> 02:20:10.984]  Something happened to her, she started having pain.
[02:20:11.823 --> 02:20:13.645]  This is why I became the doctor that I am.
[02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:20.651]  And in 2004, I opened up my first artist healing center in Tennessee, then subsequently did one in 2009 in Dallas, Texas.
[02:20:21.271 --> 02:20:30.939]  I just want your audience to know it took 12 years of her being treated with these drugs before I finally knew how to help people figure out what was the underlying causes of diseases.
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:32.641]  In my sister's case,
[02:20:33.263 --> 02:20:40.306]  She actually had microscopic parasites in her spleen that she picked up when she was 11 from the drinking water in the town she lived in.
[02:20:40.946 --> 02:20:44.808]  These parasites infiltrated her lymph system to cause all of her joint pain.
[02:20:45.188 --> 02:20:46.749]  The medical doctors called it lupus.
[02:20:47.029 --> 02:20:51.471]  It was actually a parasitic infection never diagnosed or evaluated for.
[02:20:51.991 --> 02:20:54.072]  It took two months to get rid of all the parasites.
[02:20:54.853 --> 02:20:56.914]  It took three more months to get her off her drugs.
[02:20:57.114 --> 02:21:01.976]  She hasn't been on any of those drugs for the last nine years and she has four children now.
[02:21:02.526 --> 02:21:03.967]  She had her fourth one in October.
[02:21:04.407 --> 02:21:05.527]  The body can heal.
[02:21:05.567 --> 02:21:07.448]  It has been confirmed she doesn't have lupus anymore.
[02:21:07.908 --> 02:21:13.530]  But the overall theme here is what you've been told medically is not always true.
[02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:15.451]  There is a cause for your symptoms.
[02:21:15.471 --> 02:21:18.312]  You need to find someone to tell you what's causing it.
[02:21:19.059 --> 02:21:22.682]  Not only is it a lot of times, these are intentional lies.
[02:21:23.042 --> 02:21:24.924]  Intentional lies meant for deception.
[02:21:25.364 --> 02:21:34.231]  Intentional lies meant for deception for the benefit of big pharma only and for the control of people who want complete subservience.
[02:21:34.832 --> 02:21:39.175]  And, you know, with about 50 seconds left here before we go to break, I'm holding you over.
[02:21:39.195 --> 02:21:39.736]  Don't worry about that.
[02:21:40.496 --> 02:21:45.921]  Because this story that Dr. Artis is here to tell us, I heard for the first time yesterday.
[02:21:46.773 --> 02:21:56.856]  This story that he's about to tell you today on InfoWars is going to expose to you that Anthony Fauci is not only a murderer in the current sense that we know.
[02:21:57.596 --> 02:21:58.996]  We know about the COVID-19.
[02:21:59.016 --> 02:22:00.537]  We know about the man-engineered virus.
[02:22:00.597 --> 02:22:05.298]  We know about these vaccines because those are the topics that are so heavily covered and discussed.
[02:22:06.141 --> 02:22:10.283]  But this has been going on since day one with Anthony Fauci.
[02:22:10.303 --> 02:22:22.829]  And we're going to talk about your father-in-law, and we're going to talk about what happened there, and we're going to talk about what happened immediately when this control-a-virus hit, specifically why it impacted New York, why Cuomo sent people to death camps.
[02:22:23.329 --> 02:22:27.431]  All of those things was all because of Anthony Fauci, and we're going to get to that straight ahead.
[02:22:27.551 --> 02:22:27.952]  Stick around.
[02:22:27.992 --> 02:22:28.392]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:22:28.892 --> 02:22:34.998]  Hey, it's Stu Peters at StuPeters.tv here on the Alex Jones Show final and fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:35.018 --> 02:22:39.022]  Of course, the War Room is coming up next, and I'm joined by a very fascinating guest.
[02:22:39.042 --> 02:22:53.776]  You know, we have seen trending hashtags on Twitter and other social media networks, Fire Fauci, Fauci's a murderer, he's a killer, all these things, and that is all true, but a lot of you may not be really familiar with stuff that's just publicly discoverable about how long this has been implemented since day one.
[02:22:54.456 --> 02:23:07.299]  And these inoculations being falsely referred to as vaccines, which we're seeing absolutely horrific fallout from these, it's important amid all of these things that we're unafraid to really focus on the unpopular truth, and that truth is that we are watching innocent lives lost.
[02:23:08.419 --> 02:23:13.720]  And the majority of them were not, and in fact remain not, necessary.
[02:23:14.421 --> 02:23:15.721]  These were all preventable.
[02:23:17.061 --> 02:23:20.482]  Dr. Artis personally experienced these things with his father-in-law.
[02:23:21.741 --> 02:23:25.723]  He's going to briefly run through that story so that we can get to the Fauci killer.
[02:23:26.804 --> 02:23:28.185]  Dr. Artis, thanks a lot for being here.
[02:23:28.705 --> 02:23:35.229]  Take us through your father-in-law, what you noticed there, and then how you transitioned into noticing, whoa, this is really going on.
[02:23:36.770 --> 02:23:45.915]  February 2020, early February 2020, my father-in-law walked into a hospital in Dallas, Texas, with a fever and a headache, totally independent living.
[02:23:46.601 --> 02:23:51.365]  They actually diagnosed him with the flu, put him on three antibiotics, which was actually horrible.
[02:23:51.445 --> 02:23:52.806]  Antibiotics do not treat a virus.
[02:23:53.226 --> 02:23:55.828]  One of those actual drugs is called vancomycin.
[02:23:56.588 --> 02:23:58.170]  By day one, they started treatment.
[02:23:58.230 --> 02:24:00.251]  By day two, they told us he developed pneumonia.
[02:24:00.611 --> 02:24:03.534]  By day three, they told us he was now in acute kidney failure.
[02:24:03.994 --> 02:24:10.699]  Just so you know, vancomycin, the antibiotic, causes acute kidney failure, which it started doing on day one.
[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.361]  Day one to day two.
[02:24:13.861 --> 02:24:15.062]  He did not have pneumonia.
[02:24:15.122 --> 02:24:24.386]  He actually developed pulmonary edema, which is water filling up in your lungs when you shut down someone's kidneys with a drug, which vancomycin is known to do.
[02:24:25.166 --> 02:24:31.189]  They, over a nine day period, shut down my father-in-law's kidneys, leading to his lungs filling with water.
[02:24:31.489 --> 02:24:34.611]  Eventually, by day five, his brain filled with water and he went unconscious.
[02:24:34.951 --> 02:24:39.693]  By day nine, they put him on a morphine drip and poisoned him over a four hour period.
[02:24:40.166 --> 02:24:44.010]  Overdosed him on morphine to paralyze his diaphragm and his heart and killed him.
[02:24:44.450 --> 02:24:46.812]  They actually murdered him with hospital protocols.
[02:24:47.132 --> 02:24:48.934]  Now, I did not sit back and think this was okay.
[02:24:49.294 --> 02:24:57.542]  I battled with them, every doctor, the nurse's station, the board, every day from day 5, 6, and 7, and I was eventually kicked out by security on day 7.
[02:24:58.122 --> 02:25:02.346]  They weren't allowing me there to challenge everything they were doing, but they flat-out murdered him.
[02:25:04.159 --> 02:25:04.759]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:05.619 --> 02:25:19.162]  So when the COVID-19 so-called pandemic surprisingly hit the world and there was an immediate panic, the biggest panic was, oh my gosh, we need ventilators.
[02:25:19.182 --> 02:25:19.882]  We need ventilators.
[02:25:19.922 --> 02:25:22.402]  We can't get our hands on these ventilators fast enough.
[02:25:23.082 --> 02:25:27.963]  Is that because patients were experiencing pneumonia due to COVID-19?
[02:25:29.423 --> 02:25:30.363]  Great point, Stu.
[02:25:30.423 --> 02:25:33.224]  So fast forward three months into May and June,
[02:25:33.797 --> 02:25:51.884]  After being furious about my father-in-law being murdered by an ill-advised hospital protocol, which really did murder him, I'm watching in the news the New York doctors and hospital administrators stating that when we start treating COVID-19 patients, very soon after starting treatment, the virus starts attacking the kidneys and is causing acute kidney failure.
[02:25:52.765 --> 02:25:58.267]  And we need not only ventilators, which we're short on, we also need dialysis machines, which we're also short on.
[02:25:59.062 --> 02:26:01.863]  And they kept stating, we've never seen a virus do this before.
[02:26:02.384 --> 02:26:06.386]  And I immediately wanted to know, well, what are they doing to treat these patients?
[02:26:06.506 --> 02:26:10.447]  I just watched a drug cause acute kidney failure and kill my father-in-law.
[02:26:10.988 --> 02:26:19.532]  In May and June, we were reporting in the news that there were more deaths in one day in America than the entire pandemic.
[02:26:20.212 --> 02:26:21.813]  No other country had more deaths than we did.
[02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.414]  So I wanted to know, well, what's America doing?
[02:26:23.794 --> 02:26:28.276]  The CDC website directed all people, including me, to the NIH's website.
[02:26:29.028 --> 02:26:35.593]  And on that website was Anthony Fauci's mandate for how we're going to treat all COVID-19 patients in American hospitals and clinics.
[02:26:36.374 --> 02:26:43.319]  It actually recommended a drug I'd never heard of called remdesivir and was bad-mouthing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:49.124]  Now, I didn't know anything about remdesivir, neither did any of the drug, the actual doctors in the country.
[02:26:49.384 --> 02:26:54.188]  Nobody knew about it either because it was never FDA approved and never in use because it was dangerous.
[02:26:54.585 --> 02:27:04.229]  But Anthony Fauci on the NIH's website stated there was two studies supporting using remdesivir only in this novel coronavirus pandemic.
[02:27:04.970 --> 02:27:10.752]  One was an Ebola study in 2018 in Africa, which remdesivir was used in.
[02:27:11.193 --> 02:27:14.614]  He said it was actually showed to be safe and effective against that virus.
[02:27:15.114 --> 02:27:20.537]  And then he stated a second actual study done by Gilead, the manufacturer of remdesivir,
[02:27:20.908 --> 02:27:26.532]  In early March of 2020 with 53 COVID-19 patients from three different countries.
[02:27:27.173 --> 02:27:28.694]  So I clicked the links to both of them.
[02:27:29.034 --> 02:27:31.776]  The Ebola study is referenced in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:27:31.996 --> 02:27:34.598]  I read that 2018 published study.
[02:27:34.999 --> 02:27:40.503]  There were four experimental drugs put in that study, including one from the NIH and Gilead's remdesivir.
[02:27:41.266 --> 02:27:52.275]  And what they actually stated in the study was, halfway through the study, they found that Remdesivir had the highest mortality rate of all four experimental drugs with Ebola patients.
[02:27:52.796 --> 02:27:59.581]  So the safety board for the study pulled Remdesivir from the study because it was killing more people than the other two effective ones.
[02:27:59.961 --> 02:28:04.685]  They also pulled the NIH's, Dr. Anthony Fauci's experimental drug they put in there.
[02:28:04.966 --> 02:28:08.669]  They pulled both of them because both of them had the highest death rate with all the people.
[02:28:09.718 --> 02:28:10.640]  Africa with Ebola.
[02:28:11.101 --> 02:28:14.068]  It didn't even make it to the end of the study because it killed more people than it helped.
[02:28:14.864 --> 02:28:17.927]  Yeah, and that was because it was kidney failure, correct?
[02:28:18.007 --> 02:28:40.065]  I mean, that's because it was shutting people's kidneys down and they were drowning in themselves, which is why these doctors assumed that they had to put these people on ventilators, and nine out of ten of them in New York on ventilators ended up dying, not because of the ventilator, but because they were being poisoned, killed, by remdesivir, which was the drug that was not FDA approved, that Dr. Anthony Fauci knew created the most deaths in this study, not one, but two of them.
[02:28:41.544 --> 02:28:42.284]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:42.344 --> 02:28:45.626]  The second study was actually on COVID-19 infected people.
[02:28:45.966 --> 02:28:54.769]  They found 22% of the people put on remdesivir that had COVID-19, 22% of all of them experienced four lethal side effects.
[02:28:55.410 --> 02:29:03.373]  Multiple organ failure, acute kidney failure, which is what all the media was reporting, septic shock and hypotension, all of which are lethal.
[02:29:04.268 --> 02:29:12.034]  8% of all of the COVID-19 people put on remdesivir had to be taken off the drug by day 10 because they were dying from multiple organ failure.
[02:29:13.075 --> 02:29:25.785]  I knew immediately what killed my father-in-law, which was the side effects of vancomycin, a drug, was exactly the same thing causing to all the COVID-19 patients being treated in America in hospitals, in ICUs.
[02:29:26.105 --> 02:29:29.248]  They were shutting down their kidneys with acute kidney failure side effects.
[02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:35.493]  Their lungs were all filling up with fluid and you were hearing it reported that COVID-19 is causing a secondary pneumonia.
[02:29:35.813 --> 02:29:36.394]  No, it wasn't.
[02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:38.795]  You're shutting down people's kidneys with a drug.
[02:29:39.075 --> 02:29:41.837]  You are drowning them to death and they are dying.
[02:29:42.742 --> 02:29:56.451]  And this is exactly why I went into the media to expose I was not going to allow, as much as possible, any more further injury to innocent Americans and families when we know exactly what's being caused by these drugs.
[02:29:56.692 --> 02:30:01.415]  These drugs account for up to 90% of all the deaths from COVID-19 in America.
[02:30:01.835 --> 02:30:02.816]  I am convinced of it.
[02:30:03.356 --> 02:30:06.418]  Less than 6% maybe were COVID-19 related or isolated.
[02:30:06.758 --> 02:30:08.760]  It was never as dangerous as it was proposed.
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:10.281]  The drugs were way more dangerous.
[02:30:11.284 --> 02:30:21.610]  And the people that died, supposedly from COVID-19, an astronomical percentage had comorbidities, serious ones.
[02:30:22.370 --> 02:30:34.857]  Now, 94%, one has to speculate that if Anthony Fauci, who we all know from the HIV AIDS epidemic, that he was a big part of that huge failure.
[02:30:35.842 --> 02:30:45.333]  Now he's introducing COVID-19, which we know to be man-engineered and leaked from this Wuhan lab that we were all called tinfoil hat liars for conspiring about this.
[02:30:46.194 --> 02:30:51.740]  Then he pushes remdesivir through the NIH, which he knew was killing people, but pushed it anyways.
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:55.424]  As a matter of fact, doctors would be disciplined if they used any other treatments.
[02:30:55.864 --> 02:30:57.186]  They had to use the killer.
[02:30:57.924 --> 02:30:59.347]  And now the jabs are being pushed.
[02:30:59.367 --> 02:31:00.911]  You absolutely cannot get away from it.
[02:31:00.931 --> 02:31:01.773]  It's unprecedented.
[02:31:01.793 --> 02:31:04.218]  There's never been a vaccine so widely advertised.
[02:31:04.639 --> 02:31:07.425]  We're going to discuss that when we come back for one more segment with Dr. Artis.
[02:31:07.445 --> 02:31:08.347]  We appreciate you being here.
[02:31:08.547 --> 02:31:08.848]  Stick around.
[02:31:09.753 --> 02:31:11.874]  Love being here on InfoWars.
[02:31:11.914 --> 02:31:13.295]  I just, I absolutely love it.
[02:31:13.315 --> 02:31:16.357]  I'm so humbled by the invite to be here every Friday with you guys.
[02:31:16.377 --> 02:31:16.957]  I hope it lasts.
[02:31:17.157 --> 02:31:17.717]  I hope it lasts.
[02:31:18.158 --> 02:31:20.439]  Hope we're doing a good enough job for Alex over here.
[02:31:20.979 --> 02:31:23.280]  I'm joined by a guest that really humbles me as well.
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.161]  I mean, he's been through absolute hell and back.
[02:31:25.622 --> 02:31:33.506]  You know, the diagnosis of a loved one and then the death of a father-in-law, and then to come to find out that these people were murdered intentionally.
[02:31:34.855 --> 02:31:35.856]  is absolutely sick.
[02:31:35.896 --> 02:31:53.562]  The very system that we are supposed to trust, the system that we are raised and taught to believe in, we trust those people that are wearing a badge, for example, in our law enforcement and find out that the highest levels of law enforcement in our intelligence community has come to be weaponized against us and acting nefariously against us.
[02:31:54.082 --> 02:31:55.622]  The same thing with people in lab coats.
[02:31:56.303 --> 02:31:57.143]  And a lot of these things
[02:31:57.976 --> 02:32:00.539]  Maybe because of ignorance, but a lot of it is willful.
[02:32:01.039 --> 02:32:03.922]  And we have proven that Anthony Fauci has willfully done this.
[02:32:03.982 --> 02:32:05.643]  He knows about this research.
[02:32:06.024 --> 02:32:07.145]  He's the one that conducted it.
[02:32:07.545 --> 02:32:11.329]  He knows about these medicines, that they are poisonous.
[02:32:11.909 --> 02:32:22.759]  And he is now behind, in a major way, these so-called vaccines, these inoculations that Dr. Artis are causing unprecedented deaths.
[02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:23.380]  Now,
[02:32:24.153 --> 02:32:34.038]  I know that everybody is aware of this, but let me just remind you so that you can put your mind in the right place today is 25 people died from a swine flu vaccine trial from a program.
[02:32:34.058 --> 02:32:36.759]  They halted the program immediately.
[02:32:36.779 --> 02:32:38.080]  25 deaths.
[02:32:38.981 --> 02:32:46.584]  I mean, the VAERS system, which is reliable, reports over 5,000 people have died from this, over 60,000 adverse events.
[02:32:47.165 --> 02:32:51.347]  And we know because of a Harvard study that less than 1% are actually reported.
[02:32:52.898 --> 02:32:58.243]  We're talking about some odd 72,000 people, 72,600, something like that, dead.
[02:32:59.484 --> 02:33:01.326]  What is the threshold for death?
[02:33:02.447 --> 02:33:04.729]  Why do these things continue to be pushed so hard?
[02:33:05.089 --> 02:33:06.731]  There has never been a vaccine.
[02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:10.174]  There's never been a virus so widely advertised.
[02:33:10.194 --> 02:33:11.736]  You can't get away from it.
[02:33:12.276 --> 02:33:13.037]  Can you explain that?
[02:33:16.215 --> 02:33:29.624]  Very sad and disturbing was the fact that the NIH and Anthony Fauci knew just how dangerous and death side effect causing and disease side effect causing remdesivir was years before they mandated it across the country.
[02:33:30.524 --> 02:33:35.587]  And only to find out that in October, the FDA produced a document internally to
[02:33:36.812 --> 02:33:47.545]  Talk among themselves and report to themselves what they knew were going to be reported as side effects by the American citizens from the coming COVID shots in two months in December 2020.
[02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:50.468]  And I don't know if you have the slide, Stu.
[02:33:50.669 --> 02:33:51.369]  If you do, tell me.
[02:33:51.410 --> 02:33:53.031]  If not, I'm about to hold it up on the screen.
[02:33:53.532 --> 02:33:55.615]  The FDA also knew
[02:33:56.215 --> 02:33:57.296]  Go ahead and hold it up.
[02:33:57.316 --> 02:33:58.698]  I'm not seeing it on the screen here.
[02:33:58.718 --> 02:33:59.319]  So just just hold it up.
[02:33:59.359 --> 02:34:00.961]  I mean people need to understand this.
[02:34:17.643 --> 02:34:22.884]  This is an actual FDA document, surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:34:22.984 --> 02:34:29.806]  These are the side effects that these people, and we have it on the screen now, Dr. Artis, we're talking Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[02:34:29.866 --> 02:34:31.067]  You remember Guillain-Barre.
[02:34:31.107 --> 02:34:32.547]  We have interviewed Brittany Galvin.
[02:34:32.567 --> 02:34:33.567]  She's been all over the place.
[02:34:33.627 --> 02:34:35.428]  I mean, now she's developed these tremors.
[02:34:36.229 --> 02:34:36.429]  Thank you.
[02:34:48.451 --> 02:35:06.799]  What do we need to do, Dr. Artis, in order to make the general population aware of these things as we're watching videos on YouTube, infomercials, people dancing around, creating songs, people in lab coats jumping around doing ridiculous advertisements, every billboard everywhere that you go, every store, these people are, I mean,
[02:35:07.579 --> 02:35:09.641]  They're now at the dollar store.
[02:35:10.062 --> 02:35:15.126]  At the dollar store, they are training cashiers on how to give this inoculation to people.
[02:35:15.546 --> 02:35:20.090]  At what lengths will they go and how do we make the general public aware of this?
[02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:22.092]  These people are dying.
[02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:23.573]  I mean, think about this.
[02:35:24.354 --> 02:35:26.516]  Just so everybody has a clear understanding, just picture this.
[02:35:27.077 --> 02:35:33.102]  September 11th every year at the memorial, names of over 3,000 people that perished on that day.
[02:35:33.971 --> 02:35:37.774]  Are read as a bell dings after each name is announced.
[02:35:38.314 --> 02:35:39.775]  It takes all day.
[02:35:39.795 --> 02:35:48.701]  3,000 people, which is remembered as one of the greatest losses in a single day in the history of our country.
[02:35:50.682 --> 02:35:58.087]  72,000 people have died from this shot and they are pushing it harder than ever.
[02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:03.146]  What do we do, Stu?
[02:36:03.186 --> 02:36:05.507]  If you can actually put that, can you put that slide back up there?
[02:36:05.527 --> 02:36:06.548]  Your audience needs to see this.
[02:36:06.608 --> 02:36:06.868]  Okay.
[02:36:07.368 --> 02:36:09.309]  This is so powerful for people.
[02:36:09.329 --> 02:36:10.249]  You gotta see this.
[02:36:10.769 --> 02:36:12.250]  Look at the right side of the screen.
[02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:17.972]  You will see there's three things, thrombocytopenia, and then the next two, which are related to blood clots.
[02:36:18.192 --> 02:36:20.693]  Look to the left, you've got strokes and myocardial infarction.
[02:36:21.134 --> 02:36:23.254]  These are heart attacks from blood clots.
[02:36:23.655 --> 02:36:29.337]  They knew in October, 2020, they knew two months before the shots ever came out, there was five different
[02:36:29.798 --> 02:36:32.679]  Kinds of blood clotting disorders that were going to come from these shots.
[02:36:33.099 --> 02:36:35.880]  Guillain-Barre syndrome is polio, the first one on the list.
[02:36:36.141 --> 02:36:37.641]  They knew death was going to come from it.
[02:36:37.941 --> 02:36:40.402]  They knew pregnancy and birth outcomes and miscarriages were coming.
[02:36:40.802 --> 02:36:41.423]  They know.
[02:36:41.883 --> 02:36:44.804]  Look at the bottom right, every parent, grandparent.
[02:36:45.084 --> 02:36:49.826]  On the right, second from the bottom, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.
[02:36:50.206 --> 02:36:51.307]  Let me read this to you.
[02:36:51.927 --> 02:36:56.509]  Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, this is a brand new disease, never existed before 2020.
[02:36:57.711 --> 02:36:57.951]  All right.
[02:36:58.151 --> 02:36:59.252]  I'm going to hold this up on the screen.
[02:36:59.313 --> 02:36:59.713]  Come to me.
[02:37:01.955 --> 02:37:02.656]  If you'll show me.
[02:37:05.258 --> 02:37:06.299]  The Mayo Clinic.
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.645]  The Mayo Clinic has done a review of what the multisystem inflammatory syndrome is.
[02:37:12.685 --> 02:37:14.006]  Let me give it to you by definition.
[02:37:14.326 --> 02:37:15.708]  It's only in children.
[02:37:16.068 --> 02:37:17.529]  It's going to happen to you with these shots.
[02:37:18.010 --> 02:37:20.392]  This is a serious condition, the Mayo Clinic says.
[02:37:20.965 --> 02:37:30.152]  Some organs and tissues such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin, and eyes become severely inflamed.
[02:37:30.172 --> 02:37:35.937]  The exact cause, we don't know why, but it's an excessive immune response to the shots.
[02:37:37.057 --> 02:37:46.885]  MISC, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children can lead to severe problems with vital organs that can result in permanent damage or even death.
[02:37:48.959 --> 02:37:51.700]  They knew this two months before the shots have come out.
[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:55.081]  There has already been listed on the CDC's website.
[02:37:55.341 --> 02:37:59.982]  Go to cdc.gov and type in the search bar MIS-C.
[02:38:00.443 --> 02:38:09.745]  There's already been 5,000 children diagnosed with these damaging side effects from the shots reported to the CDC by doctors.
[02:38:10.285 --> 02:38:15.187]  They're already seeing permanent damage and death to all these organs in the children.
[02:38:15.578 --> 02:38:19.179]  And they want to push this now on five-year-olds, six-months-old, and pregnant women?
[02:38:19.919 --> 02:38:26.901]  I am not okay with a hospital promoting murderous, detrimental suggestions or drugs.
[02:38:27.262 --> 02:38:30.603]  I am not okay with the FDA being okay knowing this is going to harm children.
[02:38:30.943 --> 02:38:31.943]  I am not okay with this.
[02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:33.563]  This is very dangerous.
[02:38:33.884 --> 02:38:37.185]  Stu, I'm going to ask you, this is a huge crime against humanity.
[02:38:37.465 --> 02:38:41.686]  It was a crime against my own family by one hospital and one board of a hospital.
[02:38:43.055 --> 02:38:44.335]  Crimes against humanity.
[02:38:44.575 --> 02:38:48.276]  Think about Hitler destroying and killing millions of people.
[02:38:49.697 --> 02:38:49.897]  Right?
[02:38:50.017 --> 02:38:50.837]  Think about that one.
[02:38:50.877 --> 02:38:51.277]  Just one.
[02:38:51.977 --> 02:38:52.937]  There have been others.
[02:38:53.578 --> 02:38:54.798]  What about Saddam Hussein?
[02:38:54.878 --> 02:38:57.659]  Crimes against innocent people, raping, murdering people.
[02:38:58.139 --> 02:38:59.239]  We were not okay with that.
[02:38:59.959 --> 02:39:07.121]  What was the end result that we actually called for to put an end to crimes against these humanities or crimes against humans?
[02:39:07.822 --> 02:39:20.491]  I find it atrocious, devastating, and the same thing should be applied to Anthony Fauci and all the people that are okay knowing that these things are going to damage our children, lifelong, permanent damage to their internal organs and tissues.
[02:39:20.752 --> 02:39:26.476]  It will affect the rest of their lives and possibly kill them, and they knew it before they ever told you you had to get it.
[02:39:28.017 --> 02:39:28.938]  We're going to put links.
[02:39:29.696 --> 02:39:34.899]  To those studies and to that Mayo Clinic deal at InfoWars.com.
[02:39:34.919 --> 02:39:36.240]  We're going to put it up everywhere.
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:40.042]  That should go so far and so wide.
[02:39:40.783 --> 02:39:56.472]  There are healthcare professionals, so-called doctors, that are going to push and advocate for the push of your children to get this as this emergency use authorization, which oftentimes gets mistaken for approval, which it is the furthest thing from.
[02:39:58.544 --> 02:40:04.058]  Is being pushed into age groups that are younger and younger and younger and is eventually going to go down to age zero.
[02:40:04.998 --> 02:40:23.025]  I have talked to a whistleblower inside of a healthcare system, Dr. Artis, that is telling me that she works in an OBGYN clinic for a very big healthcare system, where a doctor has standing orders for every single newly impregnated female to get this Covax without their knowledge, without their consent.
[02:40:23.105 --> 02:40:24.345]  I have seen the screenshots.
[02:40:24.385 --> 02:40:26.946]  I have to redact them, and I will bring them here next week.
[02:40:27.266 --> 02:40:29.107]  We're going to expose these people one at a time.
[02:40:29.147 --> 02:40:30.428]  You're doing a hell of a job doing it.
[02:40:30.928 --> 02:40:32.768]  Dr. Brian Artis, thank you so much for being here.
[02:40:32.868 --> 02:40:34.189]  I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
[02:40:35.675 --> 02:40:36.595]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:40:36.715 --> 02:40:41.137]  And just so you know, last statement on the Pfizer fact sheets produced by the FDA.
[02:40:41.177 --> 02:40:45.678]  It states right now, revised June 25th, 2021.
[02:40:46.178 --> 02:40:47.879]  It is your choice to receive.
[02:40:48.499 --> 02:40:50.179]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:50.219 --> 02:40:51.139]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:40:51.159 --> 02:40:53.080]  You can find me over at StuPeters.TV.
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:53.880]  Humble to be here.
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:56.081]  So last week on the Stu Peters Show,
[02:40:56.781 --> 02:41:22.146]  Dr. Jane Ruby broke on that show exclusively the findings of some Spanish researchers and the Pfizer vials they were able to obtain with a solid chain of custody by a law enforcement individual who secured the vials, they stored them appropriately, they diluted them according to Pfizer's manufacturer recommendations, and they found a toxic substance called graphene oxide.
[02:41:22.666 --> 02:41:23.346]  It went ballistic!
[02:41:23.866 --> 02:41:28.687]  It went absolutely ballistic because what is graphene oxide and how does it work?
[02:41:29.468 --> 02:41:31.648]  So Dr. Jane Ruby is going to join us now.
[02:41:32.468 --> 02:41:44.111]  Dr. Jane, in addition to the Pfizer vial, now these Spanish researchers have reported that they got a hold of AstraZeneca and also in the AstraZeneca they're finding this graphene oxide.
[02:41:44.571 --> 02:41:50.113]  Before you start here on what graphene oxide is and why people should be concerned about this, I want to mention
[02:41:51.115 --> 02:41:53.916]  The fact checkers have gone into complete panic mode.
[02:41:54.016 --> 02:41:57.197]  It's all over everywhere since you broke that on my program.
[02:41:57.277 --> 02:42:04.820]  Damage control, propaganda spewing, printed lies in an attempt to discredit the messenger of truth because their lives depend on it.
[02:42:05.583 --> 02:42:23.693]  This is about money, control, compliance, and power, but imagine the consequences, like Dr. Brian Artis just mentioned, that these people might one day face if the whole world is made aware of their participation in what could be the biggest mass murder, genocide, population-deleting weapon of bio-warfare that mankind has ever witnessed.
[02:42:27.452 --> 02:42:31.093]  Yeah, Stu, thanks for having me back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:31.573 --> 02:42:37.154]  Just so that people understand, you did a nice intro of sort of the chronology of this.
[02:42:37.634 --> 02:42:40.335]  This is a group out of Spain called La Quinta Columna.
[02:42:41.135 --> 02:42:43.395]  They are researchers, biostatisticians.
[02:42:43.495 --> 02:42:51.037]  They did use a law enforcement officer or official who is familiar with the proper chain of custody.
[02:42:51.437 --> 02:43:07.305]  They had a sealed Pfizer vial and what they found in the vial appeared to be on the recommendation and assessment of experts in biochemical engineering that this was a substance called graphene oxide.
[02:43:07.825 --> 02:43:15.409]  Now, they actually looked at it under a regular microscope and saw the gross pictures of it.
[02:43:15.949 --> 02:43:17.410]  It looks like a piece of Kleenex.
[02:43:18.090 --> 02:43:42.551]  Under some paint if you will the best way to describe it your producers have the pictures as I'm describing them and so that was the regular microscope then they put it through a Electron microscope to look at it on the molecular level and that's when they saw what appeared to be a side-by-side photo between what they were looking at under the electron microscope and they can bring it up if they could
[02:43:43.011 --> 02:43:44.332]  Could get that up, that would be great.
[02:43:44.693 --> 02:43:49.857]  And on the right hand side is from an industrial publication of graphene oxide.
[02:43:49.897 --> 02:44:01.026]  And you can see that even though the magnification is slightly different from one to the other, the one that is on your left, sample RD1, is the label for the Pfizer vial.
[02:44:01.326 --> 02:44:10.814]  They said that the volume across the space that they were looking at through the microscopes, both the regular and the electron, comprised about over 99%.
[02:44:12.075 --> 02:44:19.119]  There are many publications throughout that people can readily find in the public domain talking about the toxicity of graphene oxide.
[02:44:19.139 --> 02:44:21.161]  This is not a minute amount of it.
[02:44:41.141 --> 02:44:41.201]  I'm
[02:44:59.761 --> 02:45:00.662]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:17.131 --> 02:45:32.777]  And then they looked at an individual dose under their microscopes, and that's when you see these particles with this very eerie black, it looks like a black stocking, this black mesh that intertwines, classic for graphene oxide.
[02:45:33.437 --> 02:45:35.838]  And anyway, this single sheet
[02:45:36.298 --> 02:45:45.001]  Well, when this is injected either into your intramuscular in your deltoid muscle or in your subcutaneous tissue, the fat pad of your arm,
[02:46:06.707 --> 02:46:09.349]  It does because it is a nanoparticle.
[02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:12.631]  Remember, we're not talking about a large molecule.
[02:46:13.371 --> 02:46:15.352]  We're talking about something at the nano level.
[02:46:16.112 --> 02:46:21.595]  And so it's able to almost immediately get into your blood compartment, get into your bloodstream.
[02:46:21.996 --> 02:46:28.179]  And because of that it gets to everywhere in your body and it can affect every cell in your body.
[02:46:28.619 --> 02:46:31.300]  So it actually destroys your cell membranes.
[02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:36.161]  It's got a certain ionic charge to it, which just opens like every door.
[02:46:36.441 --> 02:46:42.823]  We've talked about the blood-brain barrier, other protective barriers in the body, and so this is important.
[02:46:42.843 --> 02:46:45.924]  So getting back to the AstraZeneca, this was a second analysis.
[02:46:45.964 --> 02:46:47.284]  They went through the same steps.
[02:46:47.825 --> 02:46:49.945]  They put it under a regular microscope.
[02:46:50.305 --> 02:46:51.626]  They saw a similar picture.
[02:46:51.686 --> 02:46:56.487]  I don't remember what we named it, but we do have a picture of a side-by-side
[02:46:56.908 --> 02:46:59.157]  That looks like a piece of Kleenex under a wet paint.
[02:47:01.994 --> 02:47:03.836]  And it is marked, I believe, AstraZeneca.
[02:47:03.876 --> 02:47:05.457]  And so they repeated this process.
[02:47:05.497 --> 02:47:20.849]  They also put it under an electron microscope and they saw the exact same, you're seeing the Pfizer analysis here, but they're seeing the exact same, these ugly, bulbous, you know, pieces in this material.
[02:47:20.909 --> 02:47:22.110]  Now people have pushed back.
[02:47:22.170 --> 02:47:27.795]  Now what you're seeing here is the regular microscope for the AstraZeneca sample.
[02:47:28.257 --> 02:47:34.140]  And you see on the right, what was, this is real graphene oxide.
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.701]  This is bonafide proven.
[02:47:36.141 --> 02:47:45.085]  On the left, where it says mu estra vacuna, that is the AstraZeneca sample before they went to the electron microscope.
[02:47:45.969 --> 02:47:55.233]  So what we're seeing here is something we never knew before, and let me just say this, people have said to me, well that's not listed on the ingredients of these companies.
[02:47:55.934 --> 02:47:59.075]  There's a lot of things that haven't been disclosed, okay?
[02:47:59.935 --> 02:48:09.520]  And if you remember correctly, there were countless pharmacists across the country who were asked to open the package insert that I've explained on many shows that is the
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:15.481]  It's a legal document that must accompany all products, drugs, medical devices.
[02:48:16.261 --> 02:48:25.844]  And when these pharmacists were asked to open the vials, the packages, and pull out the package insert, to their horror and shock, they were blank.
[02:48:26.084 --> 02:48:32.245]  And they actually had a stamped phrase on them, left blank intentionally, something to that effect.
[02:48:32.985 --> 02:48:34.688]  Well, that's not satisfactory.
[02:48:35.128 --> 02:48:40.715]  That's not informed consent in my estimation in the pharmaceutical drug development world.
[02:48:41.295 --> 02:48:48.084]  That's nowhere near informing people of what's in something and getting their full and uncoerced consent.
[02:48:48.504 --> 02:48:52.967]  To have this put into their bodies, particularly because this is experimental.
[02:48:53.388 --> 02:49:07.058]  And so this group in Spain, by the way, the AstraZeneca analysis was done in conjunction with another group of researchers in Spain called, I believe it was called Corrección Directo, something to that effect.
[02:49:07.658 --> 02:49:11.522]  This is all unfolding, Stu, literally hour by hour, day by day.
[02:49:12.203 --> 02:49:16.348]  And so we would like to know why this material is in there.
[02:49:16.808 --> 02:49:21.273]  And I'm going to go back to my original moniker, you know, hashtag just wait.
[02:49:21.413 --> 02:49:22.934]  You see how things are unfolding.
[02:49:23.615 --> 02:49:26.418]  This cannot be safe for human beings.
[02:49:27.139 --> 02:49:28.160]  It's never been tested.
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.061]  I want to also
[02:49:29.721 --> 02:49:38.688]  It has never been tested in living human beings before and I'm not sure why because this should have been run through animals.
[02:49:38.708 --> 02:49:48.074]  There are some new preclinical studies coming out in animals in animal tissues and they're warning that it's dangerous and that it needs to be tested further before being used in humans.
[02:49:48.335 --> 02:49:50.016]  So why is it in these vials?
[02:49:51.351 --> 02:49:54.134]  Dr. Jane Ruby, you can find her at DrJaneRuby.com.
[02:49:54.174 --> 02:49:56.576]  She has an encrypted and safe personal ProtonMail.
[02:49:56.616 --> 02:49:58.438]  DrJaneRuby at ProtonMail.com.
[02:49:58.458 --> 02:49:59.319]  Thank you so much for being here.
[02:49:59.359 --> 02:50:00.120]  We really appreciate it.
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:01.381]  Thank you, Stan.
[02:50:02.162 --> 02:50:02.502]  Of course.
[02:50:02.702 --> 02:50:15.355]  So as the world opens up to the knowledge of this injection, this inoculation, as we start to get more and more information, as we start to expose how many hidden agendas there were,
[02:50:16.317 --> 02:50:23.939]  Going back all the way to Remdesivir, since they announced the release of this COVID-19 virus, you remember the media was in a frenzy.
[02:50:23.959 --> 02:50:24.939]  This thing might come here.
[02:50:25.879 --> 02:50:29.140]  And we all knew right away from the beginning exactly what this was going to do.
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:32.741]  This was a part of a plan to unseat a duly elected president.
[02:50:33.481 --> 02:50:44.484]  But once they did that, they were able to find out that their dreams for population control, their dreams for ultimate complete subservience from everybody, their total control, their power, their enrichment,
[02:50:45.106 --> 02:50:46.547]  Could be taken so much further.
[02:50:47.668 --> 02:50:52.331]  This is a true, sick, demonic evil that we are fighting.
[02:50:53.512 --> 02:50:58.316]  Please go to Infowars.com and get those links that Dr. Brian Ardis said from the Mayo Clinic.
[02:50:58.356 --> 02:51:01.918]  Make sure that you show them to every single person that you know that's considering this thing.
[02:51:02.459 --> 02:51:04.320]  There are hundreds of millions of lives at stake.
[02:51:05.381 --> 02:51:07.903]  God bless you and I hope to see you next week on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:07.943 --> 02:51:08.663]  My name is Stu Peters.
[02:51:08.683 --> 02:51:10.104]  You can find me at StuPeters.TV.
[02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:36.504]  For more than a decade, I've been selling little baby Faraday cages for people that want to put their laptops, computers, and iPhones and droids inside a container, where when they travel or go places, hackers are unable to get into their phone, governments, private agencies, the UN are unable to basically track their location.
[02:51:36.584 --> 02:51:41.448]  It's not that we're doing anything wrong, it's that Big Brother uses our location
[02:51:42.148 --> 02:51:45.292]  And uses our personal information against us.
[02:51:45.712 --> 02:51:48.555]  It's the same reason we lock our doors at night and close our blinds.
[02:51:49.176 --> 02:51:51.318]  It's not that we're bad people.
[02:51:51.979 --> 02:51:56.344]  We don't want robbers being able to come up and see what we're doing inside and be able to break in.
[02:51:56.764 --> 02:52:00.569]  It's simple survival precautions that we all take.
[02:52:00.609 --> 02:52:03.652]  Now, for the first decade or so that I sold privacy boxes,
[02:52:03.792 --> 02:52:05.454]  They were a very small part of our sales.
[02:52:05.734 --> 02:52:08.417]  I explained to people that your cell phones were tracking you in live time.
[02:52:08.497 --> 02:52:25.496]  But now because the public's woken up to it, and now because Dictator Biden with the Clintons is running the global initiative with contact tracers that are coming door-to-door, and they admit that droids and Apple have merged together and are illegally putting an app on your phone to track you, even if you try to uninstall it, a secret app, it became a bestseller about a year ago.
[02:52:26.196 --> 02:52:30.661]  And we couldn't get the high rated ones anymore that were basically 99% effective.
[02:52:30.721 --> 02:52:37.328]  Because if you park right underneath the cell tower with your cell phone inside one of these Faraday cages, it's still probably going to beam through it.
[02:52:37.708 --> 02:52:41.872]  But if you're not right under a cell tower, I mean right under it, it works 99% of the time.
[02:52:41.932 --> 02:52:43.013]  We have the highest rated.
[02:52:43.094 --> 02:52:45.856]  We finally got big shipments in because of the COVID lockdowns.
[02:52:45.876 --> 02:52:46.797]  We haven't had these for months.
[02:52:46.897 --> 02:52:49.280]  They're in right now for the biggest discount ever.
[02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:52.524]  $14.95 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:52:52.544 --> 02:52:55.087]  The exact same Faraday cage sells all day for $29.95.
[02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:59.954]  We usually discount it for $19.95, but I want you all to get one out.
[02:52:59.974 --> 02:53:04.159]  They're back in stock, ready to ship right now at InfoWarsTore.com for $14.95, 50% off retail.
[02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:16.171]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[02:53:16.251 --> 02:53:17.452]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:53:17.492 --> 02:53:18.613]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:53:18.673 --> 02:53:20.054]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[02:53:20.074 --> 02:53:20.835]  And Joe Rogan?
[02:53:21.055 --> 02:53:21.555]  Elon Musk?
[02:53:21.836 --> 02:53:22.776]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:53:23.057 --> 02:53:26.059]  They tune in right here!
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:28.421]  InfoWars.
[02:53:28.781 --> 02:53:30.402]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:53:30.843 --> 02:53:34.345]  We've finally reached the point where viewers and listeners realize
[02:53:35.285 --> 02:53:37.407]  That InfoWars is not entertainment.
[02:53:37.687 --> 02:53:42.070]  For 27 years, people tuned in and a lot of them thought, well, this guy's really entertaining.
[02:53:42.190 --> 02:53:43.411]  He really has a lot of energy.
[02:53:43.631 --> 02:53:44.572]  He's really funny.
[02:53:44.772 --> 02:53:52.278]  He's saying all these crazy things about world government and where at least viruses and forced depopulation and forced legalization of pedophilia.
[02:53:52.438 --> 02:53:54.099]  He's a great science fiction writer.
[02:53:54.239 --> 02:53:55.140]  He's so crazy.
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:55.900]  He's so cute.
[02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:58.222]  It was one of the voices of the Simpsons.
[02:53:58.542 --> 02:54:06.584]  Harry Shearer, who's a great actor, great writer, did a great job at Spinal Tap, who was in a big British documentary that I was central in called Secret Rulers of the World.
[02:54:06.765 --> 02:54:07.785]  We cover Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:07.885 --> 02:54:13.687]  And he talks about, in the film, about you're listening with your family on vacation out in the woods on a shortwave to Alex Jones.
[02:54:13.767 --> 02:54:15.787]  And he's just such a great fiction writer.
[02:54:15.927 --> 02:54:18.248]  It's so convincing you buy into it.
[02:54:18.308 --> 02:54:22.529]  You see, they wouldn't go check out the white papers and documents I was talking about.
[02:54:23.109 --> 02:54:25.190]  Because in 1997, 1998, most things were not on the internet yet.
[02:54:29.485 --> 02:54:30.166]  Now it's all there.
[02:54:30.226 --> 02:54:41.156]  You can go to the Davos Group, the World Economic Forum, and see them announcing implantable chips, the end of the family, the end of the sexes, chemical castration, world government, it's all there.
[02:54:42.518 --> 02:54:53.989]  But back then, I would go to the library and pull this up and people thought I was crazy and they thought, why is this guy so concerned and why is he so charismatic for no reason?
[02:54:55.728 --> 02:54:58.811]  Because back then we were still in the beta test of the New World Order.
[02:54:59.252 --> 02:55:02.555]  Now we're in operational, which means total enslavement and death.
[02:55:04.317 --> 02:55:06.279]  I've been harping on this a lot in the last month.
[02:55:06.999 --> 02:55:08.901]  Joe Biden signed new official U.S.
[02:55:08.921 --> 02:55:13.386]  government policy, National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[02:55:14.568 --> 02:55:16.589]  And in this document, go read it for yourself online.
[02:55:16.609 --> 02:55:17.209]  Just type it in.
[02:55:17.810 --> 02:55:23.492]  They say if you question lockdowns, if you question forced inoculations, if you question the election, we're going to call you a white supremacist.
[02:55:23.592 --> 02:55:30.055]  And once we say that, that triggers the CIA and the FBI, and we're going to hunt you down and quote, take you out.
[02:55:30.215 --> 02:55:35.918]  I've got FBI spokespersons on MSNBC saying, we're going to quote, take out members of Congress that don't agree with the election.
[02:55:35.998 --> 02:55:39.880]  I mean, they're just externalizing the fact that they're going operational.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:40.701]  We're good to go.
[02:55:55.194 --> 02:56:02.003]  But now we're more important than ever because people are finally really starting to listen because they realize I'm not just pulling this out of a hat.
[02:56:02.424 --> 02:56:03.505]  I'm not just making this up.
[02:56:03.585 --> 02:56:06.169]  I'm actually documenting it and I'm researching it.
[02:56:06.189 --> 02:56:06.870]  We know what we talk about.
[02:56:07.210 --> 02:56:09.393]  So now our real work really begins.
[02:56:09.553 --> 02:56:10.795]  And if you'll just keep us in the fight.
[02:56:10.855 --> 02:56:11.556]  Thank you so much.
