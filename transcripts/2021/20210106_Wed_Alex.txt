[00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:24.117]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:24.917]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:30.880]  It's January 6th, and Donald Trump has just begun speaking to the Stop the Steal March in Washington.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.942]  Without any further ado, we go now to the President of the United States in Washington.
[00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:45.264]  We can't hear you!
[00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:48.906]  Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd.
[00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:58.971]  Even when I turned on today, I looked and I saw thousands of people here, but you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.
[00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:06.355]  We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media.
[00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:10.618]  Turn your cameras, please, and show what's really happening out here because
[00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.929]  These people are not going to take it any longer.
[00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.970]  They're not going to take it any longer.
[00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.953]  Go ahead, turn your cameras, please.
[00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:20.714]  Would you show?
[00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:28.760]  They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.583]  I just really want to see what they do.
[00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.244]  I just want to see how they cover it.
[00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:34.765]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:40.994]  It would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media.
[00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:44.135]  The media is the biggest problem we have, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.835]  Single biggest problem.
[00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.076]  The fake news and the big tech.
[00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:50.897]  Big tech is now coming into their own.
[00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:52.617]  We beat them four years ago.
[00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:53.598]  We surprised them.
[00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:54.878]  We took them by surprise.
[00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:57.359]  And this year, they rigged an election.
[00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.120]  They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.981]  And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either, if you notice.
[00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:06.982]  I'm honest.
[00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:08.988]  And I just again, I want to thank you.
[00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:11.215]  It's just a great honor to have this kind of.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:25.128]  Crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic.
[00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:36.395]  All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they're doing, and stolen by the fake news media.
[00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:38.476]  That's what they've done and what they're doing.
[00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:40.257]  We will never give up.
[00:02:40.257 --> 00:02:41.778]  We will never concede.
[00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:42.778]  It doesn't happen.
[00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:48.161]  You don't concede when there's theft involved.
[00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:50.202]  Our country has had enough.
[00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.843]  We will not take it anymore.
[00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:57.506]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:02:57.506 --> 00:03:04.850]  And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.
[00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:15.557]  Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide.
[00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:17.720]  This was not a close election.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.345]  You know, I say sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it.
[00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:23.667]  I've been in two elections.
[00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:24.508]  I won them both.
[00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:27.451]  And the second one, I won much bigger than the first.
[00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:27.772]  Okay?
[00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:38.775]  Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country.
[00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:43.580]  12 million more people than four years ago.
[00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:49.750]  And I was told by the real pollsters.
[00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.991]  We do have real pollsters.
[00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:54.934]  They know that we were going to do well and we were going to win.
[00:03:54.934 --> 00:04:04.720]  But I was told if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.742]  Well, we didn't go to 66.
[00:04:06.742 --> 00:04:09.123]  We went to 75 million.
[00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:10.384]  And they say we lost.
[00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:11.025]  We didn't lose.
[00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:18.201]  And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes?
[00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:19.324]  Does anybody believe that?
[00:04:23.427 --> 00:04:26.890]  He had 80 million computer votes.
[00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.831]  It's a disgrace.
[00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:30.073]  There's never been anything like that.
[00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:31.855]  You could take third world countries.
[00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:32.816]  Just take a look.
[00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:34.457]  Take third world countries.
[00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:38.681]  Their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country.
[00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.122]  It's a disgrace.
[00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:41.403]  It's a disgrace.
[00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:43.005]  Even when you look at last night.
[00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:46.206]  They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:06.623]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in Full Wars are no longer available.
[00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:14.465]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:16.545]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:22.307]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[00:05:22.307 --> 00:05:26.768]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:32.252]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:34.913]  And, by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months.
[00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:36.634]  It's now back in stock as well.
[00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:38.636]  They're great products and it funds the InfoWare.
[00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:43.339]  So get your Pollen Block and get your Activated Charcoal Toothpaste at InfoWareStore.com today.
[00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.021]  Again, our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste doesn't have additives.
[00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:47.922]  It's concentrated.
[00:05:47.922 --> 00:05:49.043]  People love it.
[00:05:49.043 --> 00:05:49.723]  It's amazing.
[00:05:49.723 --> 00:05:51.284]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.065]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[00:05:53.065 --> 00:05:54.987]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:57.028 --> 00:06:04.069]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:04.929]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:06.010]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.311]  We are watching live President Trump address the multitudes gathered in Washington, D.C.
[00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:14.711]  for the Stop the Steal March.
[00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:17.592]  Without any further ado, the President of the United States.
[00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:21.532]  If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.
[00:06:21.532 --> 00:06:24.793]  All he has to do, all he... This is...
[00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:33.258]  This is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, constitutional lawyers in our country.
[00:06:33.258 --> 00:06:35.339]  He has the absolute right to do it.
[00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:42.362]  We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our constitution, and protect our constitution.
[00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:46.538]  States want to revote.
[00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.639]  The states got defrauded.
[00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.920]  They were given false information.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.140]  They voted on it.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.041]  Now they want to recertify.
[00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.642]  They want it back.
[00:06:55.642 --> 00:07:02.966]  All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify.
[00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:06.668]  And we become president, and you are the happiest people.
[00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:14.931]  And I actually, I just spoke to Mike.
[00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.478]  I said, Mike, that doesn't take courage.
[00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.844]  What takes courage is to do nothing.
[00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:22.045]  That takes courage.
[00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:29.368]  And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot, and we have to live with that for four more years.
[00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:31.048]  We're just not going to let that happen.
[00:07:31.048 --> 00:07:38.270]  Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love.
[00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.151]  That's what it is.
[00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:43.272]  There's never been a movement like this, ever, ever.
[00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:49.374]  For the extraordinary love for this amazing country and this amazing movement.
[00:07:49.374 --> 00:07:49.754]  Thank you.
[00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:07.687]  By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument.
[00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:08.448]  Do you believe this?
[00:08:08.448 --> 00:08:11.469]  Look at this.
[00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:15.611]  Unfortunately, they gave the press the prime seats.
[00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.432]  I can't stand that.
[00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:19.893]  No, but you look at that behind.
[00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:22.754]  I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you.
[00:08:22.754 --> 00:08:24.535]  That is the most amazing sight.
[00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:28.990]  When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television.
[00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.411]  Amazing.
[00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.672]  Amazing.
[00:08:31.672 --> 00:08:32.453]  All the way back.
[00:08:35.117 --> 00:08:39.659]  And don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument.
[00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.740]  We will not.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.281]  Cancel culture.
[00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:46.623]  You know, they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial.
[00:08:46.623 --> 00:08:49.505]  Either take it down or just put somebody else in there.
[00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:51.026]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:52.486]  It damn well better not.
[00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:56.489]  Although with this administration, if this happens, it could happen.
[00:08:56.489 --> 00:08:58.470]  You'll see some really bad things happen.
[00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.172]  They'll knock out Lincoln, too, by the way.
[00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:02.632]  They've been taking his statue down.
[00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:04.573]  But then we signed a little law.
[00:09:04.573 --> 00:09:06.093]  You hurt our monuments.
[00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:07.553]  You hurt our heroes.
[00:09:07.553 --> 00:09:09.214]  You go to jail for 10 years.
[00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.274]  And everything stopped.
[00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:11.495]  You notice that?
[00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:12.915]  It stopped.
[00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:15.636]  It all stopped.
[00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:19.337]  And they could use Rudy back in New York City, Rudy.
[00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:20.177]  They could use you.
[00:09:20.177 --> 00:09:22.498]  Your city's going to hell.
[00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:25.979]  They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York.
[00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:28.040]  We'll get a little younger version of Rudy.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.960]  Is that okay, Rudy?
[00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:37.755]  We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason.
[00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:40.318]  To save our democracy.
[00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:51.086]  You know, most candidates on election evening, of course, this thing goes on so long, they still don't have any idea what the votes are.
[00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:53.768]  We still have congressional seats under review.
[00:09:53.768 --> 00:09:55.088]  They have no idea.
[00:09:55.088 --> 00:09:56.729]  They've totally lost control.
[00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:02.552]  They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.
[00:10:02.552 --> 00:10:03.073]  But you know,
[00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:11.509]  You know, when you see this and when you see what's happening, number one, they all say, sir, we'll never let it happen again.
[00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:12.210]  I said, that's good.
[00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.391]  But what about eight weeks ago?
[00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:14.932]  You know, they try and get you to go.
[00:10:14.932 --> 00:10:18.774]  They say, sir, in four years, you're guaranteed.
[00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:20.376]  I said, I'm not interested right now.
[00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:21.076]  Do me a favor.
[00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:22.477]  Go back eight weeks.
[00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:23.798]  I want to go back eight weeks.
[00:10:23.798 --> 00:10:24.979]  Let's go back eight weeks.
[00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:37.175]  We want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to stand for that.
[00:10:39.363 --> 00:10:45.825]  For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans, and that's what they are.
[00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:49.866]  There's so many weak Republicans, and we have great ones.
[00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.707]  Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting.
[00:10:52.707 --> 00:10:54.767]  The House guys are fighting.
[00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:56.407]  But it's incredible.
[00:10:56.407 --> 00:10:58.728]  Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in.
[00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.729]  I helped them get elected.
[00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:02.749]  I helped Mitch get elected.
[00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:04.210]  I helped.
[00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.190]  I could name...
[00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:11.505]  24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it.
[00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:18.176]  And then all of a sudden you have something like this, and it's like, oh, gee, maybe I'll talk to the president sometime later.
[00:11:19.031 --> 00:11:19.971]  No, it's amazing.
[00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.031]  They're weak Republicans.
[00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:22.412]  They're pathetic Republicans.
[00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:23.832]  And that's what happens.
[00:11:23.832 --> 00:11:28.753]  If this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on.
[00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:31.313]  There'd be hell all over the country.
[00:11:31.313 --> 00:11:32.753]  But just remember this.
[00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:34.114]  You're stronger.
[00:11:34.114 --> 00:11:35.694]  You're smarter.
[00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:38.094]  You've got more going than anybody.
[00:11:38.094 --> 00:11:42.095]  And they try and demean everybody having to do with us.
[00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:43.255]  And you're the real people.
[00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:45.876]  You're the people that built this nation.
[00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:48.076]  You're not the people that tore down our nation.
[00:11:50.848 --> 00:11:59.673]  The weak Republicans, and that's it, I really believe it, I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans, you've got a lot of them, and you've got a lot of great ones, but you've got a lot of weak ones.
[00:11:59.673 --> 00:12:12.301]  They've turned a bly eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders, and put America last.
[00:12:12.301 --> 00:12:13.762]  Did you see the other day where
[00:12:14.562 --> 00:12:17.904]  Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America first policy.
[00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.785]  What's that all about?
[00:12:18.785 --> 00:12:19.465]  Get rid of?
[00:12:19.465 --> 00:12:23.207]  How do you say I want to get rid of America first?
[00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:26.729]  Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it, right?
[00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:31.032]  Unbelievable what we have to go through, what we have to go through.
[00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:33.833]  And you have to get your people to fight.
[00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:38.256]  And if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight.
[00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:39.657]  You primary them.
[00:12:39.657 --> 00:12:41.838]  We're going to, we're going to let you know who they are.
[00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:43.239]  I can already tell you, frankly.
[00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:56.005]  But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft.
[00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:57.648]  And there's never been anything like this.
[00:12:57.648 --> 00:13:00.271]  It's a pure theft in American history.
[00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:01.112]  Everybody knows it.
[00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:05.636]  That election, our election, was over at 10 o'clock in the evening.
[00:13:05.636 --> 00:13:12.462]  We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.
[00:13:12.462 --> 00:13:19.588]  And then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit.
[00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:29.336]  And all of a sudden... All of a sudden it started to happen.
[00:13:40.927 --> 00:13:42.807]  Don't forget when Romney got beat.
[00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:43.848]  Romney.
[00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:44.788]  Did you see his?
[00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:47.989]  I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night.
[00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:53.252]  But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical.
[00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:55.793]  Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor.
[00:13:56.618 --> 00:13:57.178]  The victor.
[00:13:57.178 --> 00:13:58.820]  Who was the victor, Mitt?
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.542]  I'd like to congratulate... They don't go and look at the facts.
[00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:02.162]  Now, I don't know.
[00:14:02.162 --> 00:14:04.324]  He got... He got slaughtered, probably.
[00:14:04.324 --> 00:14:05.425]  Maybe it was okay.
[00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:07.786]  Maybe it was... That's what happened.
[00:14:07.786 --> 00:14:09.708]  But we look at the facts.
[00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:14.672]  And our election was so corrupt, that in the history of this country, we've never seen anything like it.
[00:14:14.672 --> 00:14:16.533]  You can go all the way back.
[00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:19.895]  You know, America is blessed with elections.
[00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:22.097]  All over the world, they talk about our elections.
[00:14:22.097 --> 00:14:23.918]  You know what the world says about us now?
[00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:26.741]  They said we don't have free and fair elections.
[00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:27.682]  And you know what else?
[00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:30.845]  We don't have a free and fair press.
[00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:32.666]  Our media is not free.
[00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:33.907]  It's not fair.
[00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.949]  It suppresses thought.
[00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:38.151]  It suppresses speech.
[00:14:38.151 --> 00:14:41.114]  And it's become the enemy of the people.
[00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:43.516]  It's become the enemy of the people.
[00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:46.499]  It's the biggest problem we have in this country.
[00:14:47.392 --> 00:14:53.915]  No third world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing.
[00:14:53.915 --> 00:14:56.256]  And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes.
[00:14:56.256 --> 00:15:06.960]  Republicans are Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.881]  It's like a boxer.
[00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:12.022]  And we want to be so nice.
[00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:16.744]  We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people.
[00:15:17.932 --> 00:15:20.815]  And we're going to have to fight much harder.
[00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:23.677]  And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.
[00:15:23.677 --> 00:15:29.062]  And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country.
[00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:34.267]  Because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.
[00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:42.643]  Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.
[00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:47.504]  Donald Trump giving it to Republicans and Democrats alike in defense of the Constitution.
[00:15:47.504 --> 00:15:49.165]  We have to go to a quick commercial break.
[00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:50.165]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:55.687]  We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump live from outside the White House when we get back.
[00:15:55.687 --> 00:15:56.327]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.275]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:01.336]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.758]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:05.919]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:08.101]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.582]  The Resistance not video.
[00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:22.142]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[00:16:22.142 --> 00:16:28.305]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:31.267]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[00:16:32.087 --> 00:16:33.428]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:34.949]  Thank you for holding.
[00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:03.062]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:17:03.062 --> 00:17:04.583]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[00:17:04.583 --> 00:17:05.883]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[00:17:05.883 --> 00:17:06.504]  How are you?
[00:17:06.504 --> 00:17:07.424]  I love you, man.
[00:17:07.424 --> 00:17:09.546]  I want to make a quick plug.
[00:17:09.546 --> 00:17:11.607]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[00:17:11.607 --> 00:17:17.910]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin,
[00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:33.062]  Which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine, and it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:53.798]  We went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks, thanks for the plug.
[00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:05.214]  Since our election, I'm... You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:05.214 --> 00:18:06.697]  ...and even these guys knew what happened.
[00:18:06.697 --> 00:18:08.199]  They know what happened.
[00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:10.443]  They're saying, wow, Pennsylvania...
[00:18:15.939 --> 00:18:16.980]  We are live, folks.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.000]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.761]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:22.843]  We're watching President Trump address the multitudes out in front of the White House.
[00:18:22.843 --> 00:18:30.928]  Alex Jones will soon be leading a parade to the Capitol, but for now, we go back to the President of the United States, who's laying out the evidence of the vote fraud.
[00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:33.230]  We set a record.
[00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.012]  And we set a record with Hispanic, with the black community.
[00:18:37.012 --> 00:18:40.934]  We set a record with everybody.
[00:18:40.934 --> 00:18:41.735]  Today we see
[00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:50.317]  A very important event, though, because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place.
[00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:55.000]  And I'm going to be watching because history is going to be made.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.067]  We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:19:04.462 --> 00:19:08.223]  Throughout history, throughout eternity, they'll be ashamed.
[00:19:08.223 --> 00:19:09.484]  And you know what?
[00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:14.766]  If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did.
[00:19:14.766 --> 00:19:16.867]  Never forget.
[00:19:16.867 --> 00:19:19.148]  We should never, ever forget.
[00:19:19.148 --> 00:19:26.170]  With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States.
[00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:31.192]  And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because
[00:19:34.318 --> 00:19:37.641]  And don't, I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person.
[00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:40.303]  And Kelly Loeffler, two great people.
[00:19:40.303 --> 00:19:42.004]  But it was a setup.
[00:19:42.004 --> 00:19:47.328]  And you know, I said, we have no backline anymore.
[00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:56.394]  The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the President of the United States.
[00:19:56.394 --> 00:20:02.999]  So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.947]  I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House.
[00:20:07.947 --> 00:20:09.450]  Those are warriors.
[00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.976]  They're over there working like you've never seen before.
[00:20:12.976 --> 00:20:13.618]  Studying, talking.
[00:20:15.658 --> 00:20:24.946]  Actually, going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.
[00:20:24.946 --> 00:20:30.150]  They gave these people bad things to vote for, and they voted, because what did they know?
[00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:35.995]  And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.
[00:20:35.995 --> 00:20:39.639]  And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy,
[00:20:40.544 --> 00:20:45.669]  Is Hillary Clinton, because she said, why didn't you do this for me four years ago?
[00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:49.072]  Why didn't you do this for me four years ago?
[00:20:49.072 --> 00:20:50.834]  Change the votes.
[00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.495]  10,000 in Michigan.
[00:20:52.495 --> 00:20:54.497]  You could have changed the whole thing.
[00:20:54.497 --> 00:20:56.019]  But she's not too happy.
[00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:57.820]  You don't see her anymore.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.361]  What happened?
[00:20:58.361 --> 00:20:59.842]  Where's Hillary?
[00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:00.303]  Where is she?
[00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.492]  But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women.
[00:21:06.492 --> 00:21:11.014]  I also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the U.S.
[00:21:11.014 --> 00:21:12.255]  Senate.
[00:21:12.255 --> 00:21:20.918]  Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.
[00:21:20.918 --> 00:21:24.940]  And Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been so great.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.801]  She works so hard.
[00:21:26.727 --> 00:21:31.011]  So, let's give her and David a little special hand, because it was rigged against them.
[00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:33.072]  Let's give her and David.
[00:21:33.072 --> 00:21:37.116]  Kelly Laughlin, David Perdue.
[00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:38.437]  They fought a good race.
[00:21:38.437 --> 00:21:40.539]  They never had a shot.
[00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:46.304]  That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people, don't let them use this stuff!
[00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:50.117]  Marsha Blackburn, terrific person.
[00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:51.938]  Mike Braun, Indiana.
[00:21:51.938 --> 00:21:53.699]  Steve Daines, great guy.
[00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:55.099]  Bill Hagerty.
[00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:56.820]  John Kennedy.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.941]  James Langford.
[00:21:57.941 --> 00:21:59.882]  Cynthia Lumps.
[00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:02.883]  Tommy Tuberville, the coach.
[00:22:02.883 --> 00:22:03.804]  And Roger Marshall.
[00:22:03.804 --> 00:22:04.704]  We want to thank them.
[00:22:04.704 --> 00:22:05.924]  Senators have stepped up.
[00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:06.785]  We want to thank them.
[00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:14.149]  I actually think, though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up.
[00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:16.830]  And I think a lot of those people are going to find that out.
[00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:22.474]  And you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.
[00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:25.395]  You know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people.
[00:22:25.395 --> 00:22:26.716]  We want to give them $600.
[00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:27.917]  Oh, great.
[00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:29.138]  How does that play politically?
[00:22:29.138 --> 00:22:29.898]  Pretty good.
[00:22:29.898 --> 00:22:32.580]  And this has nothing to do with politics.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.281]  But how does it play politically?
[00:22:35.281 --> 00:22:37.843]  China destroyed these people.
[00:22:38.715 --> 00:22:39.616]  We didn't destroy them.
[00:22:39.616 --> 00:22:41.396]  China destroyed them.
[00:22:41.396 --> 00:22:42.697]  Totally destroyed them.
[00:22:42.697 --> 00:22:43.438]  We want to give them $600.
[00:22:43.438 --> 00:22:47.460]  And they just wouldn't change.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.821]  I said, give them $2,000.
[00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:51.162]  We'll pay it back.
[00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:53.223]  We'll pay it back fast.
[00:22:53.223 --> 00:22:55.844]  You already owe $26 trillion.
[00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:57.105]  Give them a couple of bucks.
[00:22:57.105 --> 00:22:58.366]  Let them live.
[00:22:58.366 --> 00:22:59.947]  Give them a couple of bucks!
[00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:08.228]  And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, look, you got to let people live.
[00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:09.369]  And how does that play, though?
[00:23:09.369 --> 00:23:11.571]  OK, number one, it's the right thing to do.
[00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:13.112]  But how does that play politically?
[00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:15.434]  I think it's the primary reason.
[00:23:15.434 --> 00:23:16.976]  One of the primary reasons.
[00:23:16.976 --> 00:23:18.697]  The other was just pure cheating.
[00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.639]  That was the primary, super primary reason.
[00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:22.396]  But you can't do that.
[00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:23.897]  Gotta use your head.
[00:23:23.897 --> 00:23:30.238]  As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud.
[00:23:30.238 --> 00:23:31.839]  You ever see these people?
[00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:35.260]  While there's no evidence of fraud, or really?
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.460]  Well, I'm gonna read you pages.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.161]  I hope you don't get bored listening to it.
[00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:39.121]  Promise?
[00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:44.862]  Don't get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there.
[00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:46.243]  Move them up, please.
[00:23:46.243 --> 00:23:46.563]  Yeah.
[00:23:48.309 --> 00:23:52.591]  All these people, don't get bored, don't get angry at me because you're gonna get bored.
[00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:54.031]  Because it's so much.
[00:23:54.031 --> 00:23:59.373]  The American people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore.
[00:23:59.373 --> 00:24:02.474]  They have ruined their reputation.
[00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:05.134]  But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me, I'd fight.
[00:24:05.134 --> 00:24:07.755]  So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight, bop bop.
[00:24:07.755 --> 00:24:10.916]  You'd believe me, you'd believe them, somebody comes out, you know.
[00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:13.497]  They had their point of view, I had my point of view.
[00:24:13.497 --> 00:24:14.637]  But you'd have an argument.
[00:24:14.637 --> 00:24:16.278]  Now what they do is they go silent.
[00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:19.024]  It's called suppression.
[00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:22.365]  And that's what happens in a communist country.
[00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:23.566]  That's what they do.
[00:24:23.566 --> 00:24:24.706]  They suppress.
[00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:27.508]  You don't fight with them anymore, unless it's a bad story.
[00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:32.230]  If they have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline.
[00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.990]  But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him.
[00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.911]  What happened to Hunter?
[00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.011]  Where's Hunter?
[00:24:36.011 --> 00:24:37.572]  Where is Hunter?
[00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:39.273]  They don't talk about him.
[00:24:39.273 --> 00:24:41.834]  Now watch, all the sets will go off.
[00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:45.015]  Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings.
[00:24:45.015 --> 00:24:46.056]  The ratings are too good.
[00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:48.176]  No, where's Hunter?
[00:24:48.176 --> 00:24:48.696]  You know?
[00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:55.918]  And how come Joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine?
[00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:57.478]  How does that happen?
[00:24:57.478 --> 00:24:58.679]  I'd ask you that question.
[00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:00.319]  How does that happen?
[00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:03.100]  Can you imagine if I said that?
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.100]  If I said that, it would be a whole different ballgame.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:12.822]  And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife?
[00:25:14.028 --> 00:25:22.398]  And gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy.
[00:25:22.398 --> 00:25:24.921]  And millions of dollars up front.
[00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.767]  And how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage?
[00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:31.129]  Have you managed money before?
[00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:31.750]  No, I haven't.
[00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.310]  Oh, that's good.
[00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.272]  Here's about three billion.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.080]  No, they don't talk about that.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.981]  No, we have a corrupt media.
[00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:39.601]  They've gone silent.
[00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:40.862]  They've gone dead.
[00:25:40.862 --> 00:25:43.422]  I now realize how good it was.
[00:25:43.422 --> 00:25:53.545]  If you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love him, I realized how good it was like a cleansing motion, right?
[00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:55.285]  But we don't have that anymore.
[00:25:55.285 --> 00:25:58.506]  We don't have a fair media anymore.
[00:25:58.506 --> 00:25:59.807]  It's suppression.
[00:25:59.807 --> 00:26:01.427]  And you have to be very careful with that.
[00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:04.594]  And they've lost all credibility in this country.
[00:26:04.594 --> 00:26:10.338]  We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies.
[00:26:11.465 --> 00:26:15.728]  That we've been forced to believe over the past several weeks.
[00:26:15.728 --> 00:26:20.992]  We've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election.
[00:26:20.992 --> 00:26:23.314]  This is the presidential election.
[00:26:23.314 --> 00:26:31.801]  Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.
[00:26:31.801 --> 00:26:34.523]  You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States.
[00:26:36.232 --> 00:26:46.476]  And you know when I... This is President of the United States, Donald Trump, giving perhaps the most important speech of his entire presidency and perhaps will change the course of history.
[00:26:46.476 --> 00:26:50.118]  He plans on laying out in detail the evidence of voter fraud.
[00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:53.679]  We'll bring it all to you live on Infowars.com and Band.video.
[00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:56.120]  On the other side, folks, don't go anywhere.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.321]  You must guard your humanity.
[00:26:58.321 --> 00:27:00.162]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[00:27:01.172 --> 00:27:03.955]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:12.462]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:19.888]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops.
[00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:25.613]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[00:27:26.837 --> 00:27:37.920]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses who are then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.981]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[00:27:44.981 --> 00:27:47.002]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[00:27:47.762 --> 00:27:54.029]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:56.731]  It's all the same in the end.
[00:27:56.731 --> 00:28:00.315]  Lemster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:03.118]  Other dictionaries have some like yours.
[00:28:03.118 --> 00:28:08.123]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[00:28:10.766 --> 00:28:14.672]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[00:28:14.672 --> 00:28:17.796]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:20.581]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:22.964]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[00:28:22.964 --> 00:28:25.548]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[00:28:25.548 --> 00:28:26.429]  They told us that
[00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.793]  Two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:32.713]  Okay?
[00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:37.216]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:39.597]  We're talking 96% had co-morbidity.
[00:28:39.597 --> 00:28:40.418]  These are real numbers.
[00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:41.699]  These are real facts.
[00:28:41.699 --> 00:28:46.962]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential.
[00:28:46.962 --> 00:28:49.563]  All the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:50.364]  Rebuke it.
[00:28:50.364 --> 00:28:51.544]  Stand up against it.
[00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:53.085]  This is slavery.
[00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:55.527]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[00:28:56.408 --> 00:29:05.579]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[00:29:05.579 --> 00:29:12.408]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it.
[00:29:12.768 --> 00:29:13.969]  This does not have the fluoride.
[00:29:13.969 --> 00:29:15.389]  It doesn't have the additives.
[00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:16.610]  This is a concentrate.
[00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.091]  It really is high quality.
[00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:23.233]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:25.014]  But now it's back in stock.
[00:29:25.014 --> 00:29:29.437]  Info Wars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.

[00:29:41.983 --> 00:29:43.445]  And it supports the InfoWars.
[00:29:43.445 --> 00:29:45.729]  Activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals.
[00:29:45.729 --> 00:29:49.174]  Available again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:49.174 --> 00:29:53.741]  And a lot of other products that have been sold out have just now come back in as well, like Pollen Block.
[00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:54.983]  So check that out when you're in the store.
[00:29:56.793 --> 00:30:01.057]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming.
[00:30:01.057 --> 00:30:04.661]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:09.926]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:16.313]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices, and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[00:30:16.733 --> 00:30:20.158]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[00:30:20.158 --> 00:30:22.461]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[00:30:22.461 --> 00:30:30.451]  The globalists are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[00:30:30.451 --> 00:30:31.953]  That's why, while we still can,
[00:30:32.714 --> 00:30:33.635]  Never see it before.
[00:30:33.635 --> 00:30:35.575]  I think it's going to go away.
[00:30:35.575 --> 00:30:35.996]  Absolutely.
[00:30:35.996 --> 00:30:53.044]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:59.629]  You have a Republican legislature.
[00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:02.252]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:17.517]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:17.517 --> 00:31:20.659]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:31:20.659 --> 00:31:25.342]  Just 11 days prior to the election, so think of what they did.
[00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:28.343]  No longer is there signature verification.
[00:31:28.343 --> 00:31:29.544]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:31:39.178 --> 00:31:41.139]  We want voter ID, by the way.
[00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:44.999]  But no longer is there signature verification.
[00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:47.900]  11 days before the election, they say, we don't want it.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.940]  You know why they don't want to?
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.001]  Because they want to cheat.
[00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:52.141]  That's the only reason.
[00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:53.502]  Who would even think of that?
[00:31:53.502 --> 00:31:56.382]  We don't want to verify a signature.
[00:31:56.382 --> 00:32:02.364]  There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania.
[00:32:02.364 --> 00:32:04.384]  Now think of this.
[00:32:04.384 --> 00:32:04.704]  You had 205,000
[00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:11.453]  More ballots than you had voters.
[00:32:11.453 --> 00:32:12.334]  That means you had two hundred.
[00:32:12.334 --> 00:32:13.194]  Where did they come from?
[00:32:13.194 --> 00:32:14.355]  You know where they came from?
[00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:17.336]  Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed.
[00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:25.201]  So in Pennsylvania, you had two hundred and five thousand more votes than you had voters.
[00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:28.403]  And it's the numbers actually much greater than that now.
[00:32:28.403 --> 00:32:30.544]  That was as of a week ago.
[00:32:30.544 --> 00:32:33.746]  And this is a mathematical impossibility.
[00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.872]  Unless you want to say it's a total fraud.
[00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:40.654]  So Pennsylvania was defrauded.
[00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:53.863]  Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election.
[00:32:53.863 --> 00:32:54.444]  Think of that.
[00:32:54.444 --> 00:32:56.165]  Dead people.
[00:32:56.165 --> 00:32:57.085]  Lots of dead people.
[00:32:57.085 --> 00:32:58.086]  Thousands.
[00:32:58.086 --> 00:33:00.988]  And some dead people actually requested an application.
[00:33:00.988 --> 00:33:01.929]  That bothers me a bit.
[00:33:03.177 --> 00:33:06.221]  Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote.
[00:33:06.221 --> 00:33:09.686]  One of them was 29 years ago died.
[00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:10.528]  It's incredible.
[00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:15.334]  Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters.
[00:33:15.334 --> 00:33:17.337]  So these are voters that don't live in the state.
[00:33:18.376 --> 00:33:26.644]  And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome determinative, meaning these numbers far surpassed.
[00:33:26.644 --> 00:33:28.245]  I lost by a very little bit.
[00:33:28.245 --> 00:33:31.168]  These numbers are massive, massive.
[00:33:31.168 --> 00:33:41.017]  More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day.
[00:33:41.017 --> 00:33:41.778]  In other words,
[00:33:43.183 --> 00:33:45.104]  They were received after Election Day.
[00:33:45.104 --> 00:33:46.604]  Let's count them anyway.
[00:33:46.604 --> 00:33:50.285]  And what they did in many cases is they did fraud.
[00:33:50.285 --> 00:33:55.987]  They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day.
[00:33:55.987 --> 00:34:02.409]  And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back.
[00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:06.070]  They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out.
[00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:10.412]  In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it!
[00:34:10.412 --> 00:34:11.292]  Which is also
[00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.711]  Logically and logistically impossible, right?
[00:34:17.711 --> 00:34:18.331]  Think of that one.
[00:34:18.331 --> 00:34:19.571]  You got the ballot back.
[00:34:19.571 --> 00:34:20.692]  Let's send the ballots.
[00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:23.072]  Oh, they've already been sent.
[00:34:23.072 --> 00:34:25.533]  But we got the ballot back before they were sent.
[00:34:25.533 --> 00:34:28.173]  I don't think that's too good, right?
[00:34:28.173 --> 00:34:40.616]  25,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation.
[00:34:40.616 --> 00:34:41.537]  You're not allowed to do it.
[00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:42.297]  It's against the law.
[00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:50.244]  The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out.
[00:34:50.244 --> 00:34:58.753]  Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people!
[00:34:58.753 --> 00:35:05.420]  It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots one day after the election.
[00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.472]  It remains totally unexplained.
[00:35:08.472 --> 00:35:11.174]  They said, well, we can't, ah, figure that.
[00:35:11.174 --> 00:35:14.496]  Now that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state.
[00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:16.598]  Just that one element.
[00:35:16.598 --> 00:35:21.241]  400,000 ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.
[00:35:21.241 --> 00:35:24.944]  By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this.
[00:35:24.944 --> 00:35:27.186]  They didn't know because it was so quick.
[00:35:27.186 --> 00:35:28.127]  They had to vote.
[00:35:28.127 --> 00:35:29.267]  They voted.
[00:35:29.267 --> 00:35:30.528]  But now they see all this stuff.
[00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:32.070]  It's all come to light.
[00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.170]  Doesn't happen that fast.
[00:35:34.162 --> 00:35:38.628]  And they want to re-certify their votes.
[00:35:38.628 --> 00:35:39.930]  They want to re-certify.
[00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:48.020]  But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.243]  Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.
[00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:05.143]  And many people in Congress want it sent back.
[00:36:05.143 --> 00:36:06.844]  And think of what you're doing.
[00:36:06.844 --> 00:36:07.944]  Let's say you don't do it.
[00:36:07.944 --> 00:36:10.245]  Somebody says, well, we have to obey the Constitution.
[00:36:10.245 --> 00:36:15.287]  And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution.
[00:36:15.287 --> 00:36:16.268]  So you are.
[00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:17.768]  But think of what happens.
[00:36:17.768 --> 00:36:20.930]  Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people.
[00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:25.992]  And they say, well, we really have no choice, even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo
[00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:28.633]  Their votes.
[00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:30.333]  They want to see the numbers.
[00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:31.754]  They already have the numbers.
[00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:32.894]  Go very quickly.
[00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:34.755]  And they want to redo their legislature.
[00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:39.356]  Because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature.
[00:36:39.356 --> 00:36:40.017]  You know?
[00:36:40.017 --> 00:36:41.477]  That in itself is legal.
[00:36:41.477 --> 00:36:43.038]  And then you have the scam.
[00:36:43.038 --> 00:36:45.598]  And that's all of the things that we're talking about.
[00:36:45.598 --> 00:36:47.019]  But think of this.
[00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:54.842]  If you don't do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years with his wonderful son.
[00:36:54.842 --> 00:36:55.542]  You will have
[00:36:56.846 --> 00:37:00.850]  A president who lost all of these states.
[00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:11.739]  Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states.
[00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:13.761]  You will have an illegitimate president.
[00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:15.402]  That's what you'll have.
[00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:17.264]  And we can't let that happen.
[00:37:17.264 --> 00:37:18.184]  These are the facts.
[00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:21.547]  That you won't hear from the fake news media.
[00:37:21.547 --> 00:37:24.088]  It's all part of the suppression effort.
[00:37:24.088 --> 00:37:25.688]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:37:25.688 --> 00:37:27.149]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:33.311]  In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off.
[00:37:33.311 --> 00:37:35.751]  And that's a lot of cameras back there.
[00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:36.932]  But a lot of them went off.
[00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:40.968]  But these are the things you don't hear about.
[00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:42.870]  You don't hear what you just heard.
[00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.353]  I'm going to go over a few more states.
[00:37:45.353 --> 00:37:52.682]  But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you, big tech media.
[00:37:52.682 --> 00:37:54.985]  Just like the suppression polls that said
[00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:59.258]  We're gonna lose Wisconsin by 17 points.
[00:37:59.258 --> 00:38:00.879]  Well, we won Wisconsin.
[00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:02.580]  They don't have it that way.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.761]  Because they lose just by a little sliver.
[00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:08.343]  But they had me down the day before Washington Post ABC poll.
[00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:10.844]  Down 17 points!
[00:38:10.844 --> 00:38:12.225]  I called up a real pollster.
[00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:13.706]  I said, what is that?
[00:38:13.706 --> 00:38:15.267]  Sir, that's called a suppression poll.
[00:38:16.067 --> 00:38:18.270]  I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir.
[00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.393]  I said, but why don't they make it four or five points?
[00:38:20.393 --> 00:38:22.075]  Because then people vote.
[00:38:22.075 --> 00:38:25.800]  But when you're down 17, they say, hey, I'm not going to waste my time.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.983]  I love the president, but there's no way.
[00:38:27.983 --> 00:38:32.709]  Despite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin.
[00:38:32.709 --> 00:38:33.410]  It's going to see.
[00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.110]  I mean, you'll see.
[00:38:36.254 --> 00:38:53.746]  But that's called suppression, because a lot of people, when they see that, it's very interesting, this pollster said, sir, if you're down 3, 4, 5 people vote, when you go down 17, they say, let's save, let's go and have dinner, and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.
[00:38:53.746 --> 00:39:04.774]  And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media, every time I put out a tweet, that's, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag.
[00:39:06.297 --> 00:39:07.678]  I get a flag.
[00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.579]  And they also don't let you get out.
[00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:13.221]  You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account.
[00:39:13.221 --> 00:39:15.682]  It's very hard to get out a message.
[00:39:15.682 --> 00:39:19.244]  They don't let the message get out, nearly like they should.
[00:39:19.244 --> 00:39:22.266]  But I've had many people say, I can't get on your Twitter!
[00:39:22.266 --> 00:39:23.507]  I don't care about Twitter.
[00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:24.627]  Twitter's bad news.
[00:39:24.627 --> 00:39:26.208]  They're all bad news.
[00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:27.729]  But you know what?
[00:39:27.729 --> 00:39:32.172]  If you want to get out a message, and if you want to go through big tech social media,
[00:39:33.012 --> 00:39:37.676]  They are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice.
[00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:39.378]  I guess they call it shadow ban, right?
[00:39:39.378 --> 00:39:40.099]  Shadow ban.
[00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:42.481]  They shadow ban you!
[00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:44.383]  And it should be illegal.
[00:39:44.383 --> 00:39:51.889]  I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230.
[00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:56.053]  And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there.
[00:39:56.053 --> 00:39:57.274]  And they don't realize that.
[00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:03.115]  That's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us.
[00:40:03.115 --> 00:40:05.237]  Never.
[00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:06.538]  Let them get out.
[00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:07.939]  Let the weak ones get out.
[00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:11.261]  This is a time for strength.
[00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:17.867]  They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so.
[00:40:17.867 --> 00:40:20.109]  They want to indoctrinate your children.
[00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:27.314]  It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up
[00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:32.197]  And saying, no, this crowd is, again, a testament to it.
[00:40:32.197 --> 00:40:33.478]  I did no advertising.
[00:40:33.478 --> 00:40:34.578]  I did nothing.
[00:40:34.578 --> 00:40:36.559]  You do have some groups that are big supporters.
[00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:38.620]  I want to thank that, Amy and everybody.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.861]  We have some incredible supporters.
[00:40:40.861 --> 00:40:41.881]  Incredible.
[00:40:41.881 --> 00:40:42.862]  But we didn't do anything.
[00:40:42.862 --> 00:40:47.604]  We have pre-programmed commercial breaks, but we'll keep our interjections to an absolute minimum.
[00:40:47.604 --> 00:40:55.588]  We'll be right back in just a minute or so to hear more from the President of the United States live in front of the White House, addressing the Save America March.
[00:40:55.868 --> 00:40:58.289]  Hey Alex, how you doing, man?
[00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.349]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:01.270]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:09.852]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[00:41:09.852 --> 00:41:12.993]  I said, man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update.
[00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:21.720]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on the Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it is for me personally.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:27.905]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 40 thanks to this tenfold four store product.
[00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.506]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[00:41:31.848 --> 00:41:33.490]  I'm doing what I can, brother.
[00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:41.157]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense.
[00:41:41.157 --> 00:41:44.360]  Now you gotta follow that up with the Micros VX.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.141]  I learned that.
[00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:48.043]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[00:41:48.043 --> 00:41:48.644]  We didn't know.
[00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:49.825]  We didn't screen your call.
[00:41:49.825 --> 00:41:50.606]  We had no idea.
[00:41:50.606 --> 00:41:54.269]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[00:41:56.539 --> 00:42:03.485]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[00:42:03.485 --> 00:42:08.030]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[00:42:09.731 --> 00:42:13.374]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[00:42:13.374 --> 00:42:17.817]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[00:42:17.817 --> 00:42:23.921]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:37.251]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:42:37.691 --> 00:42:44.175]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[00:42:44.175 --> 00:42:49.677]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[00:42:49.677 --> 00:42:50.578]  So help me God.
[00:42:55.941 --> 00:43:00.103]  It's back in stock.
[00:43:00.103 --> 00:43:01.584]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[00:43:01.584 --> 00:43:04.666]  They couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:05.747]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[00:43:05.747 --> 00:43:10.109]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:16.093]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.253]  It's amazing.
[00:43:17.253 --> 00:43:18.654]  Folks absolutely love it.
[00:43:18.654 --> 00:43:21.076]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[00:43:21.636 --> 00:43:23.477]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[00:43:23.477 --> 00:43:26.458]  25% off at m4workstore.com.
[00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:30.220]  Pollen Block, again, is available in this one-minute ad.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:40.065]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and
[00:43:40.425 --> 00:43:40.765]  I don't know.
[00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.555]  The Great Reset is here.
[00:43:58.555 --> 00:44:12.200]  The world government has openly been announced, and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family, and to make you so poor, you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income, worse inoculations, and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.120]  That's why it's important.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:24.984]  Pray to God, be politically active, and get prepared for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need so you're not dependent on the system.
[00:44:24.984 --> 00:44:27.844]  We have the best storable food at the lowest price you're going to find.

[00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.942]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:45:12.942 --> 00:45:25.070]  We go live directly to Donald Trump, President of the United States, addressing his supporters in Washington, D.C.
[00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.432]  Signatures in Fulton County.
[00:45:28.432 --> 00:45:29.732]  They won't let us do it.
[00:45:29.732 --> 00:45:35.116]  The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands
[00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:42.867]  Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt?
[00:45:42.867 --> 00:45:43.928]  They won't do it.
[00:45:43.928 --> 00:45:46.230]  They go to some other county where you would live.
[00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.692]  I said, that's not the problem.
[00:45:48.692 --> 00:45:52.796]  The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams.
[00:45:52.796 --> 00:45:53.577]  She did a good job.
[00:45:53.577 --> 00:45:54.397]  I congratulate her.
[00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:58.541]  But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen.
[00:45:58.541 --> 00:46:00.103]  We won't have a country if it happens.
[00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:13.822]  As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.
[00:46:13.822 --> 00:46:21.044]  48 counties in Georgia with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots.
[00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:22.185]  There wasn't one ballot.
[00:46:23.208 --> 00:46:36.756]  In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.
[00:46:36.756 --> 00:46:43.840]  The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.781]  That's the only way you can explain it.
[00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:48.063]  By the way, you're talking about tens of thousands.
[00:46:48.968 --> 00:47:02.239]  If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, there should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected, far more than what we needed to win.
[00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:03.120]  Just over 11,000.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.842]  They should find those votes.
[00:47:05.842 --> 00:47:08.965]  They should absolutely find that.
[00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:09.906]  Just over 11,000 votes.
[00:47:09.906 --> 00:47:11.287]  That's all we need.
[00:47:12.486 --> 00:47:15.307]  They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia.
[00:47:15.307 --> 00:47:17.228]  And we're not going to forget it.
[00:47:17.228 --> 00:47:27.251]  There's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, oppose voter ID and stop citizenship confirmation.
[00:47:27.251 --> 00:47:28.471]  Are you a citizenship?
[00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:31.232]  You're not allowed to ask that question.
[00:47:31.232 --> 00:47:34.113]  Because they want to steal the election.
[00:47:34.113 --> 00:47:36.914]  The radical left knows exactly what they're doing.
[00:47:37.793 --> 00:47:42.275]  They're ruthless, and it's time that somebody did something about it.
[00:47:42.275 --> 00:47:50.239]  And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country.
[00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:54.381]  And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you, I will tell you right now.
[00:47:55.996 --> 00:47:58.438]  I'm not hearing good stories.
[00:47:58.438 --> 00:48:07.966]  In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases physically, from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst.
[00:48:07.966 --> 00:48:09.287]  Water main burst.
[00:48:09.287 --> 00:48:10.688]  Everybody leave.
[00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:12.669]  Which we now know was a total lie.
[00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:21.038]  Then election officials pulled boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table.
[00:48:21.038 --> 00:48:22.420]  You all saw it on television.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.981]  Totally fraudulent.
[00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:28.406]  And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised.
[00:48:29.207 --> 00:48:30.769]  Tens of thousands of votes.
[00:48:30.769 --> 00:48:39.301]  This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden.
[00:48:39.301 --> 00:48:41.023]  Almost none for Trump.
[00:48:41.023 --> 00:48:42.905]  Oh, that sounds fair.
[00:48:42.905 --> 00:48:43.606]  That was at 1.34 a.m.
[00:48:46.718 --> 00:48:54.860]  The Georgia Secretary of State and pathetic Governor of Georgia, although he says I'm a great President, you know, I sort of maybe have to change.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.541]  He said the other day, yes, I disagree with President, but he's been a great President.
[00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:01.402]  Oh, good, thanks.
[00:49:01.402 --> 00:49:03.342]  Thank you very much.
[00:49:03.342 --> 00:49:04.522]  Because of him and others.
[00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:07.043]  Yeah, Brian Kemp, vote him the hell out of office, please.
[00:49:09.687 --> 00:49:15.371]  Well, his rates are so low, you know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low.
[00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:22.937]  They've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County.
[00:49:22.937 --> 00:49:29.881]  Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering.
[00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:38.428]  Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died
[00:49:39.088 --> 00:49:54.892]  In 2020 and prior to the election, more than 2500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison, people who are not allowed to vote.
[00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:59.613]  More than 4500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear
[00:50:00.473 --> 00:50:03.274]  On the state's own voter rolls.
[00:50:03.274 --> 00:50:13.759]  Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.
[00:50:13.759 --> 00:50:24.605]  At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.
[00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:25.085]  66,000 votes.
[00:50:25.085 --> 00:50:27.066]  Each one of these is far more than we need.
[00:50:29.035 --> 00:50:33.999]  66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.
[00:50:33.999 --> 00:50:41.326]  And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3rd election.
[00:50:41.326 --> 00:50:43.088]  They say they moved right back.
[00:50:43.088 --> 00:50:43.788]  They moved right back.
[00:50:43.788 --> 00:50:45.150]  Oh, they moved out, they moved right back.
[00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.750]  Okay.
[00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.292]  They miss Georgia that much.
[00:50:47.292 --> 00:50:47.652]  I do.
[00:50:47.652 --> 00:50:48.753]  I love Georgia.
[00:50:48.753 --> 00:50:50.495]  But it's a corrupt system.
[00:50:51.115 --> 00:50:56.237]  Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.
[00:50:56.237 --> 00:51:06.401]  Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia.
[00:51:06.401 --> 00:51:08.142]  A big, beautiful victory.
[00:51:08.142 --> 00:51:13.404]  Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me, and from the country.
[00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:19.147]  And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:26.042]  This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.
[00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:33.464]  In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens.
[00:51:33.464 --> 00:51:36.725]  2,000 ballots were returned with no address.
[00:51:36.725 --> 00:51:42.446]  More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out.
[00:51:42.446 --> 00:51:44.507]  They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.
[00:51:44.507 --> 00:51:47.007]  11,600 more ballots and votes were counted.
[00:51:49.915 --> 00:51:51.776]  More than there were actual voters.
[00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:52.556]  You see that?
[00:51:52.556 --> 00:51:56.757]  So you have more votes, again, than you have voters.
[00:51:56.757 --> 00:52:04.239]  150,000 people registered in Myakopa County after the registration deadline.
[00:52:04.239 --> 00:52:10.961]  103,000 ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers.
[00:52:11.701 --> 00:52:24.424]  In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.
[00:52:24.424 --> 00:52:29.245]  If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.
[00:52:29.245 --> 00:52:34.366]  There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada, over 150,000 people.
[00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:39.606]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.765 --> 00:53:04.646]  Is down at a very low number.
[00:53:04.646 --> 00:53:07.627]  Any of these things would have taken care of the situation.
[00:53:07.627 --> 00:53:10.007]  We would have won Nevada also.
[00:53:10.007 --> 00:53:12.468]  Every one of these we're going over, we win.
[00:53:12.468 --> 00:53:23.051]  In Michigan, quickly, the Secretary of State, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls.
[00:53:23.051 --> 00:53:24.952]  Indirect violation of state law.
[00:53:25.712 --> 00:53:34.486]  More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased.
[00:53:34.486 --> 00:53:36.489]  In Wayne County, that's a great one.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.742]  That's Detroit.
[00:53:40.742 --> 00:53:44.965]  174,000 ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter.
[00:53:44.965 --> 00:53:47.167]  Nobody knows where they came from.
[00:53:47.167 --> 00:53:58.275]  Also in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.
[00:53:58.275 --> 00:54:01.577]  In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters.
[00:54:01.577 --> 00:54:02.338]  Think of that.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.746]  So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting.
[00:54:10.746 --> 00:54:15.192]  This is in Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, a career employee of the Detroit
[00:54:16.952 --> 00:54:29.256]  City of Detroit testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for.
[00:54:29.256 --> 00:54:32.197]  When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him.
[00:54:32.197 --> 00:54:42.200]  The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.901]  She also told to illegally and was told backdate ballots.
[00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:54.446]  Received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated.
[00:54:54.446 --> 00:54:55.287]  That's Michigan.
[00:54:55.287 --> 00:55:10.457]  Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes.
[00:55:10.457 --> 00:55:12.979]  Every single one was for a Democrat.
[00:55:12.979 --> 00:55:13.680]  I got no votes.
[00:55:14.668 --> 00:55:15.909]  At 6.31 a.m.
[00:55:15.909 --> 00:55:24.894]  in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes.
[00:55:24.894 --> 00:55:30.977]  An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement.
[00:55:32.319 --> 00:55:37.386]  Trump is laying out the numbers in black and white in front of the White House in Washington, D.C.
[00:55:37.386 --> 00:55:39.228]  We have to go to a quick commercial break.
[00:55:39.228 --> 00:55:43.593]  It'll be one minute long and we'll be back immediately with more of the President's speech.
[00:55:43.593 --> 00:55:44.534]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:55:44.534 --> 00:55:45.195]  Stay with us, please.
[00:55:46.178 --> 00:55:50.022]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:55:50.022 --> 00:55:54.347]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:55:54.347 --> 00:56:02.476]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:03.217 --> 00:56:19.826]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[00:56:19.826 --> 00:56:30.852]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[00:56:31.332 --> 00:56:39.842]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:56:39.842 --> 00:56:45.188]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:56:48.536 --> 00:56:55.799]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[00:56:55.799 --> 00:57:10.345]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd, Juncker, and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessman technocrats over them.
[00:57:10.345 --> 00:57:11.966]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[00:57:11.966 --> 00:57:14.227]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched
[00:57:15.027 --> 00:57:17.448]  The COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[00:57:17.448 --> 00:57:20.729]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:26.432]  You see, he believes, because he's hidden in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[00:57:26.432 --> 00:57:28.172]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[00:57:28.172 --> 00:57:30.633]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[00:57:30.633 --> 00:57:34.495]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[00:57:34.495 --> 00:57:37.356]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism, in his own words.
[00:57:37.996 --> 00:57:43.461]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[00:57:43.461 --> 00:57:45.743]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[00:57:45.743 --> 00:57:46.863]  All right?
[00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.585]  Registered voter.
[00:57:48.585 --> 00:57:58.153]  The letter continues, there is clear evidence... You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:58.153 --> 00:58:05.439]  Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good
[00:58:06.334 --> 00:58:08.617]  Welcome back folks.
[00:58:08.617 --> 00:58:10.440]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show has begun.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:20.754]  We go live back to Donald Trump in front of the White House laying out in stark detail the hundreds of thousands of inconsistencies that have yet to been addressed by the mainstream media.
[00:58:21.886 --> 00:58:26.368]  I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state.
[00:58:26.368 --> 00:58:28.850]  And all of these legislatures want this back.
[00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:33.532]  I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here.
[00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:52.123]  But I could just go on forever.
[00:58:52.123 --> 00:59:06.227]  I can tell you this.
[00:59:06.227 --> 00:59:15.269]  So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody said.
[00:59:15.269 --> 00:59:16.770]  This is a criminal enterprise.
[00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:20.122]  This is a criminal enterprise.
[00:59:20.122 --> 00:59:24.823]  And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there because that's no good.
[00:59:24.823 --> 00:59:26.484]  Have you ever seen?
[00:59:26.484 --> 00:59:36.627]  While there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion, I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it.
[00:59:36.627 --> 00:59:38.608]  There's never been anything like it.
[00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.268]  Think about it.
[00:59:39.728 --> 00:59:43.771]  Detroit had more votes than it had voters.
[00:59:43.771 --> 00:59:47.954]  Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more votes.
[00:59:47.954 --> 00:59:51.296]  You don't have to go between that.
[00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:55.138]  I think that's almost better than dead people, if you think, right?
[00:59:55.138 --> 00:59:59.161]  More votes than they had voters, and many other states also.
[00:59:59.161 --> 01:00:01.823]  It's a disgrace that the United States of America
[01:00:02.813 --> 01:00:10.359]  Tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.
[01:00:10.359 --> 01:00:14.222]  In no state is there any question or effort.
[01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:22.476]  Made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency, or eligibility of the votes cast.
[01:00:22.476 --> 01:00:24.137]  The Republicans have to get tougher.
[01:00:24.137 --> 01:00:27.421]  You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher.
[01:00:27.421 --> 01:00:32.065]  They want to play so straight, they want to play so... Sir, yes, the United States.
[01:00:32.065 --> 01:00:35.829]  The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to their states.
[01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:42.911]  Well, I say yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country, and you have to protect our Constitution.
[01:00:42.911 --> 01:00:44.872]  And you can't vote on fraud.
[01:00:44.872 --> 01:00:47.192]  And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it?
[01:00:47.192 --> 01:00:53.694]  When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.
[01:00:53.694 --> 01:00:57.575]  So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.
[01:00:57.575 --> 01:01:01.956]  And I hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening to.
[01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:15.100]  It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons, and people who have moved out of state, and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.862]  Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls.
[01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:20.263]  They don't want to clean them up.
[01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:20.964]  They're loaded.
[01:01:21.664 --> 01:01:35.200]  And how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one who got seven ballots!
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.764]  And then they say, you didn't quite make it, sir.
[01:01:38.764 --> 01:01:40.346]  We won in a landslide.
[01:01:40.346 --> 01:01:41.828]  This was a landslide.
[01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:48.865]  They said it's not American to challenge the election.
[01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:52.306]  This is the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.
[01:01:52.306 --> 01:01:59.889]  You know, you can go third world countries, but I don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them.
[01:01:59.889 --> 01:02:02.109]  I mean, no matter where you go, nobody would think this.
[01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:04.370]  In fact, it's so egregious.
[01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:06.571]  It's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it.
[01:02:06.571 --> 01:02:09.352]  It's so crazy that people don't even believe it.
[01:02:09.352 --> 01:02:10.092]  It can't be true.
[01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.494]  So they don't believe it.
[01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:17.295]  This is not just a matter of domestic politics.
[01:02:17.295 --> 01:02:20.936]  This is a matter of national security.
[01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:31.998]  So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms.
[01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:35.138]  And you better do it before we have no country left.
[01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:36.819]  Today is not the end.
[01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.019]  It's just the beginning.
[01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:47.945]  With your help over the last four years, we've built the greatest political movement in the history of our country, and nobody even challenged it.
[01:02:47.945 --> 01:02:49.306]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:02:49.306 --> 01:02:51.609]  It's the 62nd break, and we return live from Washington, D.C.
[01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:52.250]  It's Infowars.com.
[01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:53.411]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:54.012]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:56.636 --> 01:03:03.462]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products and forwards are no longer available.
[01:03:03.462 --> 01:03:11.348]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[01:03:11.348 --> 01:03:13.090]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:19.175]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[01:03:19.175 --> 01:03:23.679]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[01:03:23.979 --> 01:03:28.702]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[01:03:28.702 --> 01:03:31.784]  And, by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months.
[01:03:31.784 --> 01:03:33.505]  It's now back in stock as well.
[01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.487]  They're great products and it funds the InfoWare.

[01:03:43.872 --> 01:03:44.833]  It's concentrated.
[01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:45.894]  People love it.
[01:03:45.894 --> 01:03:46.594]  It's amazing.
[01:03:46.594 --> 01:03:48.135]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[01:03:48.135 --> 01:03:49.936]  And Pollen Block is great as well.
[01:03:49.936 --> 01:03:52.158]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:03:52.158 --> 01:03:53.118]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:03:53.899 --> 01:03:54.580]  We're good.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.261]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:04:06.261 --> 01:04:07.101]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:07.101 --> 01:04:08.002]  My name's Harrison Smith.
[01:04:08.002 --> 01:04:10.804]  Donald Trump is finishing up his remarks in front of the White House.
[01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:17.830]  At the same time, the joint session of the House has begun, and we'll bring you both of these as they occur.
[01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:23.895]  We'll go back to Donald Trump as he finishes up, and then we'll jump over to Mike Pence as he leads the Senate.
[01:04:24.568 --> 01:04:29.451]  We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.
[01:04:29.451 --> 01:04:42.940]  We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote, and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.
[01:04:44.127 --> 01:04:54.632]  We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day, so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.
[01:04:54.632 --> 01:05:10.240]  We will finally hold Big Tech accountable, and if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.
[01:05:13.132 --> 01:05:22.718]  All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped.
[01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:27.161]  And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats.
[01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:32.704]  They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law.
[01:05:33.264 --> 01:05:35.226]  They're totally breaking the law.
[01:05:35.226 --> 01:05:41.971]  Together we will drain the Washington swamp, and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital.
[01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:45.094]  We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy?
[01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:46.715]  It's a dirty business.
[01:05:46.715 --> 01:05:48.156]  It's a dirty business.
[01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:50.558]  You have a lot of bad people out there.
[01:05:50.558 --> 01:05:59.305]  Despite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds, although this I think is our all-time record,
[01:06:02.139 --> 01:06:05.781]  I think you have 250,000 people.
[01:06:05.781 --> 01:06:07.742]  250,000!
[01:06:07.742 --> 01:06:10.583]  Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today.
[01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:15.625]  I have never been more confident in our nation's future.
[01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:18.267]  Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful.
[01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:21.828]  That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.
[01:06:21.828 --> 01:06:29.272]  If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country, because it's illegal when the votes are illegal.
[01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:32.774]  When the way they got there is illegal.
[01:06:32.774 --> 01:06:38.075]  When the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.
[01:06:38.075 --> 01:06:41.355]  We are the greatest country on earth.
[01:06:41.355 --> 01:06:44.016]  And we are headed and were headed in the right direction.
[01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:45.676]  You know, the wall is built.
[01:06:45.676 --> 01:06:47.397]  We're doing record numbers at the wall.
[01:06:47.397 --> 01:06:48.897]  Now they want to take down the wall.
[01:06:48.897 --> 01:06:51.318]  Let's let everyone flow in.
[01:06:51.318 --> 01:06:52.738]  Let's let everybody flow in.
[01:06:54.994 --> 01:06:56.475]  We did a great job in the wall.
[01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:57.256]  Remember the wall?
[01:06:57.256 --> 01:06:58.577]  They said it could never be done.
[01:06:58.577 --> 01:07:03.161]  One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country.
[01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:04.903]  And it's had a tremendous impact.
[01:07:04.903 --> 01:07:06.284]  We got rid of tax and release.
[01:07:06.284 --> 01:07:09.286]  We got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with.
[01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:11.789]  But now the caravans, they think Biden's getting in.
[01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:14.231]  The caravans are forming again.
[01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:17.093]  They want to come in again and rip off our country.
[01:07:17.093 --> 01:07:17.954]  Can't let it happen.
[01:07:18.897 --> 01:07:24.420]  As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side.
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.882]  We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts.
[01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:29.383]  We love our country.
[01:07:29.383 --> 01:07:35.787]  We have overwhelming pride in this great country, and we have it deep in our souls.
[01:07:35.787 --> 01:07:43.332]  Together we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:07:47.398 --> 01:07:50.899]  Our brightest days are before us.
[01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:53.520]  Our greatest achievements still wait.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:03.362]  I think one of our great achievements will be election security, because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were.
[01:08:03.362 --> 01:08:10.024]  And again, most people would stand there at nine o'clock in the evening and say, I want to thank you very much.
[01:08:10.024 --> 01:08:12.345]  And they go off to some other life.
[01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:14.085]  But I said, something's wrong here.
[01:08:14.085 --> 01:08:15.326]  Something's really wrong.
[01:08:15.326 --> 01:08:16.126]  Can't have happened.
[01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:18.118]  And we fight.
[01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:19.459]  We fight like hell.
[01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:23.560]  And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:29.141]  Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun.
[01:08:29.141 --> 01:08:42.205]  My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country, and I say this, despite all that's happened, the best is yet to come.
[01:08:46.147 --> 01:09:09.314]  So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give, the Democrats are hopeless, they're never voting for anything, not even one vote, but we're going to try and give our Republicans
[01:09:10.492 --> 01:09:14.215]  The weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help.
[01:09:14.215 --> 01:09:22.220]  We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.483]  So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:09:25.483 --> 01:09:27.464]  I want to thank you all.
[01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.865]  God bless you.
[01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.247]  And God bless America.
[01:09:31.247 --> 01:09:32.368]  Thank you all for being here.
[01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.308]  This is incredible.
[01:09:33.308 --> 01:09:34.109]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:34.898 --> 01:09:43.443]  Donald Trump, President of the United States, finishes up his statements in front of the White House at the same time the joint session of Congress is started.
[01:09:43.443 --> 01:09:45.865]  We're going to take the audio of that now.
[01:09:45.865 --> 01:09:54.130]  And Alex Jones, at this moment, is leading the march towards the Capitol building where the Senate and Congress are joining together.
[01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:58.873]  Let's go to inside the chamber here.
[01:09:58.873 --> 01:10:03.676]  The report is... Be victorious no matter what happens in 15 days!
[01:10:06.103 --> 01:10:06.123]  1776!
[01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:06.523]  1776!
[01:10:06.523 --> 01:10:06.543]  1776! 1776!
[01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:33.779]  The Democrats have gone so insane that they're now making the words mother and father illegal in legislative bodies.
[01:10:33.779 --> 01:10:34.981]  Have you heard this?
[01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:40.206]  Nancy Pelosi has proposed that the words mother and father are illegal.
[01:10:40.206 --> 01:10:42.709]  So I got news for Nancy Pelosi.
[01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:44.651]  Donald Trump is your daddy!
[01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:51.252]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump said it in his speech today.
[01:10:51.252 --> 01:10:53.993]  He said the Democrats are out to get us.
[01:10:53.993 --> 01:10:55.474]  They want to destroy us.
[01:10:55.474 --> 01:10:57.054]  They work for the globalists.
[01:10:57.054 --> 01:10:59.635]  They want to bring America down.
[01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:01.716]  But we're not going to let them do it!
[01:11:05.191 --> 01:11:21.845]  This new system is a military high-tech attack, and we need to understand we're under attack, and we need to understand this is 21st century warfare, and give them a war footing, and not just take this country back, but take the whole world back from the communist Chinese!
[01:11:24.392 --> 01:11:24.893]  USA!
[01:11:24.893 --> 01:11:25.753]  USA!
[01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:26.194]  USA!
[01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:26.654]  USA!
[01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:52.313]  And so today we march to the Capitol, because on this historic January 6th, 2021, we have to let our congressmen and women know, and we have to let Mike Pence know, they stole our election.
[01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:53.614]  We know they stole it.
[01:11:53.614 --> 01:11:55.556]  We're not going to accept it.
[01:11:55.556 --> 01:11:59.118]  Do the right thing, because there's a million of us here in D.C.
[01:11:59.118 --> 01:12:04.322]  telling you to, and you have a constitutional and legal, you have to do it.
[01:12:04.322 --> 01:12:05.582]  It's your duty.
[01:12:05.582 --> 01:12:08.424]  It's your duty to save this election from being stolen.
[01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:09.405]  So they must do it.
[01:12:10.706 --> 01:12:13.850]  This is a live feed from Washington DC right now.
[01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:18.756]  Alex Jones and Owen Schroer speaking to a large crowd at the same time in the Capitol building.
[01:12:18.756 --> 01:12:19.096]  The word is
[01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:32.650]  Mike Pence has rejected Trump's call.
[01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:43.076]  He has failed to show the courage that Donald Trump was attempting to imbue in him and has begun the counting of the electoral votes.
[01:12:43.076 --> 01:12:53.162]  At the same time, there's word that thousands of patriots have broken through the barriers around the Capitol and are now moving towards it to occupy.
[01:12:53.162 --> 01:12:56.123]  That's the word from Elijah Schaefer, who's on the ground.
[01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:58.464]  And Alex Jones continues to speak to this crowd.
[01:12:58.464 --> 01:12:59.405]  Let's go back to Alex Jones.
[01:13:01.281 --> 01:13:03.302]  And the Great Awakening!
[01:13:03.302 --> 01:13:08.663]  The Great Reset is triggering the Great Awakening!
[01:13:08.663 --> 01:13:15.726]  And the Great Awakening will trigger the Great Rebellion and the destruction of the New World Order!
[01:13:19.122 --> 01:13:23.625]  We all know that our system has been corrupt for a long time.
[01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:37.776]  The whole world knows our system has been corrupt for a long time, and they've been waiting for Americans to stand up, and they've been waiting for a leader of America to stand up and do the right thing, expose it, and then bring it to its knees for its ultimate defeat.
[01:13:37.776 --> 01:13:40.598]  And that's what we do, starting now, in the year 2020!
[01:13:42.941 --> 01:13:43.762]  This is it, folks.
[01:13:43.762 --> 01:13:51.011]  Live from Washington, D.C., Mike Pence rejects Trump's call to overturn Biden election as patriots move towards the Capitol building.
[01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:51.872]  This is it, folks.
[01:13:51.872 --> 01:13:54.455]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with it live.
[01:13:54.455 --> 01:13:59.000]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.543]  This is taken under the tongue.
[01:14:01.543 --> 01:14:02.684]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:14:03.715 --> 01:14:12.918]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:14:12.918 --> 01:14:18.759]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[01:14:18.759 --> 01:14:20.900]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.603]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:26.444]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[01:14:26.444 --> 01:14:28.566]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[01:14:28.566 --> 01:14:30.747]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[01:14:30.747 --> 01:14:32.108]  Some like bodies better.
[01:14:32.108 --> 01:14:36.251]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[01:14:36.251 --> 01:14:37.432]  And they fund the InfoWar.

[01:14:54.325 --> 01:14:59.610]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:02.332]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.033]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:05.695]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:06.656]  That was a crazy week.
[01:15:06.656 --> 01:15:14.142]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health.
[01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:18.323]  Not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:15:18.323 --> 01:15:23.506]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[01:15:23.506 --> 01:15:24.327]  I'm going to wake up today.
[01:15:24.327 --> 01:15:24.907]  You know what?
[01:15:24.907 --> 01:15:29.150]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.391]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:32.892]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:15:32.892 --> 01:15:33.693]  It's never happened to me.
[01:15:33.693 --> 01:15:36.615]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.316]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:41.218]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:15:41.218 --> 01:15:49.203]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[01:15:49.203 --> 01:15:52.505]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:15:52.505 --> 01:15:56.927]  Kool-Aid's bad, the TurboForce is good.
[01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:59.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:10.011 --> 01:16:12.213]  Welcome back folks to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:12.213 --> 01:16:13.354]  My name is Harrison Smith.
[01:16:13.354 --> 01:16:16.037]  News pouring in from many different directions right now.
[01:16:16.037 --> 01:16:21.543]  Alex Jones and Owen Schroer are live outside the Capitol addressing the crowd by bullhorn.
[01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.865]  Donald Trump has just finished up his speech.
[01:16:23.865 --> 01:16:29.390]  The Senate and the Congress are meeting right now to debate the objections
[01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:37.775]  Breaking from Elijah Schaffer, patriots have stormed the Capitol building ground and are breaching federal barriers and police in the masses.
[01:16:37.775 --> 01:16:39.396]  No cell service but video coming.
[01:16:39.396 --> 01:16:41.157]  Non-lethal force in effect.
[01:16:41.157 --> 01:16:43.818]  Full unlawful assembly on display.
[01:16:43.818 --> 01:16:45.039]  Never seen anything like this.
[01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:45.999]  Insane.
[01:16:45.999 --> 01:16:55.604]  Thousands occupying and you see the video here of patriots pushing against the Capitol City police as they move towards the Capitol building.
[01:16:55.604 --> 01:16:59.046]  Estimates upwards of a million patriots right now have gathered for this.
[01:16:59.526 --> 01:17:03.227]  And threaten to overwhelm the defenses of the Capitol building.
[01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:09.069]  From the election wizard on Twitter, 60 congressmen have just objected to the electoral votes from Arizona.
[01:17:09.069 --> 01:17:12.150]  Applause rung out in the halls of Congress.
[01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:21.233]  Vice President Mike Pence released this statement essentially abrogating the responsibility of rejecting or accepting the electoral votes.
[01:17:21.233 --> 01:17:24.354]  He says during the 130 years since the Electoral Count Act was passed,
[01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:24.794]  We're good.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:40.820]  I think?
[01:17:57.262 --> 01:17:58.263]  We're good to go.
[01:18:19.451 --> 01:18:23.833]  Republicans have objected to accepting Arizona's electoral votes.
[01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:32.516]  Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona objected to the counting of electoral votes from Arizona won by Joe Biden.
[01:18:32.516 --> 01:18:35.497]  So chaos abounds around the Capitol building.
[01:18:35.497 --> 01:18:36.978]  We are now getting a live feed.
[01:18:37.518 --> 01:18:52.035]  As Alex Jones continues to lead the march towards the Capitol building and we are receiving video updates on the ground as it looks like Patriots are threatening to overwhelm the security of the Capitol and break in.
[01:18:52.035 --> 01:18:57.300]  Let's go back to Alex Jones as he marches and we'll continue to get updates here.
[01:18:58.248 --> 01:19:01.754]  Again, this is unprecedented in American history.
[01:19:01.754 --> 01:19:09.288]  You can hear the police alarms going off as chaos reigns.
[01:19:13.672 --> 01:19:15.273]  Ambulance is moving towards the scene.
[01:19:15.273 --> 01:19:26.062]  You can see there on the right is the old post office building, which is now the Trump Hotel, which has been a major gathering point for patriots ever since Trump got elected.
[01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.064]  They're moving now through Freedom Plaza.
[01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:31.066]  You can see this massive stream of humanity.
[01:19:32.627 --> 01:19:41.930]  Alex Jones, Owen Schroyer, Greg Reese, and others falling behind as they march towards the Capitol building, which is already under siege.
[01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:51.373]  Ian Miles Chong tweets out, there's just so many Trump supporters surrounding the Capitol, and you see this massive manatee of, as we say, estimated a million people.
[01:19:53.143 --> 01:19:59.225]  Moving to surround the Capitol, Owen Troyer and Alex Jones now speaking through the bullhorn to the crowds who follow them.
[01:19:59.225 --> 01:20:02.966]  We're coming for all the army traitors in Congress that have stabbed us in the back.
[01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:05.326]  You've stabbed us in the back one too many times.
[01:20:05.326 --> 01:20:09.727]  Coming with truth and justice and non-violent civil disobedience.
[01:20:09.727 --> 01:20:10.508]  Yes.
[01:20:10.508 --> 01:20:12.548]  Tell them Owen.
[01:20:12.548 --> 01:20:15.609]  Tell them Alex.
[01:20:17.332 --> 01:20:19.293]  This is history happening!
[01:20:19.293 --> 01:20:21.134]  We're not giving in to the globalists!
[01:20:21.134 --> 01:20:23.094]  We're never surrendering!
[01:20:23.094 --> 01:20:26.096]  This is our country!
[01:20:26.096 --> 01:20:30.077]  This is our country, not our corrupt politicians' country!
[01:20:30.077 --> 01:20:31.838]  They work for us!
[01:20:31.838 --> 01:20:35.620]  And it's time they got a friendly reminder who their boss is!
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:41.862]  The communist Chinese and the globalists in Hollywood don't run this country!
[01:20:41.862 --> 01:20:46.104]  And our children do not belong in their pedophile trash!
[01:20:47.378 --> 01:20:52.182]  We will not accept a fake election of that child molesting Joe Biden!
[01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:54.824]  That Chinese Communist agent Joe Biden!
[01:20:54.824 --> 01:20:58.006]  We know where he belongs, and it's not the White House!
[01:20:58.006 --> 01:21:00.508]  China Joe Biden is a child molester!
[01:21:00.508 --> 01:21:03.470]  China Joe, baby!
[01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.772]  China Joe's got to go!
[01:21:05.772 --> 01:21:08.394]  China Joe has got to go!
[01:21:08.394 --> 01:21:11.116]  China Joe has got to go!
[01:21:13.823 --> 01:21:15.905]  We're good to go!
[01:21:30.396 --> 01:21:37.343]  The Capitol, you see mace being sprayed, punches being thrown in both directions as the conflict escalates.
[01:21:37.343 --> 01:21:38.884]  This is truly incredible.
[01:21:38.884 --> 01:21:40.065]  Historic stuff, folks.
[01:21:40.065 --> 01:21:41.807]  The day has just begun.
[01:21:41.807 --> 01:21:49.594]  The violence may get out of control, but you see the Capitol Police there fully suited up in riot gear, ready for whatever occurs.
[01:21:49.594 --> 01:21:50.355]  Here's Steve Scalise.
[01:21:51.035 --> 01:21:54.197]  So everybody knew what the rules were.
[01:21:54.197 --> 01:21:58.819]  People on both sides knew how to play the rules before the game started.
[01:21:58.819 --> 01:22:06.543]  Not getting somewhere in the process and saying, well, you don't think it's going to benefit you, so you try to go around the Constitution.
[01:22:06.543 --> 01:22:08.784]  That's not how our system works.
[01:22:08.784 --> 01:22:11.045]  It's gotten out of hand.
[01:22:11.045 --> 01:22:14.027]  And so President Trump has called this out.
[01:22:14.027 --> 01:22:15.507]  And President Trump has stood up to it.
[01:22:15.507 --> 01:22:17.688]  So many of us have stood up to it.
[01:22:17.688 --> 01:22:18.189]  And in fact,
[01:22:19.292 --> 01:22:26.104]  Over a hundred of my colleagues, Madam Speaker, asked the Supreme Court to address this problem just a few weeks ago.
[01:22:26.104 --> 01:22:29.449]  And unfortunately, the Court chose to punt.
[01:22:30.609 --> 01:22:32.310]  They didn't answer one way or the other.
[01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.192]  They didn't want to get in the middle of this discussion.
[01:22:35.192 --> 01:22:41.095]  Here's an update as of less than a minute ago, Hill staffers have been told to evacuate the Madison building.
[01:22:41.095 --> 01:22:46.778]  Things are getting tenuous here as Trump supporters and patriots continue to pour towards the Capitol.
[01:22:46.778 --> 01:22:52.881]  Alex Jones himself at the head of a massive column of patriots moving now towards the United States Capitol building.
[01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:59.265]  We go back now to Steve Scalise who inside the Capitol building is objecting to counting the votes from Arizona.
[01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:03.745]  Every single Republican voted to reform the process.
[01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:06.668]  Every single Democrat voted against it.
[01:23:06.668 --> 01:23:09.751]  They don't want to fix this problem.
[01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:12.754]  But the Constitution is our guide.
[01:23:13.962 --> 01:23:16.724]  And it's time we start following the Constitution.
[01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:22.308]  It's time we get back to what our founding father said is the process for selecting electors.
[01:23:22.308 --> 01:23:24.050]  That's the legislatures.
[01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:25.631]  In public view.
[01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:26.872]  Not behind closed doors.
[01:23:26.872 --> 01:23:28.653]  Not smoke-filled rooms.
[01:23:28.653 --> 01:23:31.375]  Not bullying somebody that might give you a better ruling.
[01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:36.599]  Let's get back to rule of law and follow the Constitution, Madam Speaker.
[01:23:36.599 --> 01:23:39.582]  And I yield back the balance of my time.
[01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:48.713]  It's Steve Scalise addressing the Congressional House and objecting to the counting of votes.
[01:23:48.713 --> 01:23:55.076]  Trump supporters are storming the grounds of the Capitol building and have torn down fences, punches being thrown, mace being sprayed.
[01:23:55.076 --> 01:23:56.757]  This is an ongoing situation.
[01:23:56.757 --> 01:24:00.658]  Crowds continue to increase in size as they move towards the Capitol.
[01:24:02.299 --> 01:24:05.782]  This is coming from just various different streams.
[01:24:05.782 --> 01:24:09.404]  An evacuation order has been issued for the Madison Building.
[01:24:09.404 --> 01:24:18.210]  Here you see the Trump supporters tearing down the fences as this mass of humanity moves towards the Capitol in defiance of the
[01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:19.191]  I think?
[01:24:35.595 --> 01:24:37.236]  Just monitoring all different feeds.
[01:24:37.236 --> 01:24:38.337]  We have our own feed here.
[01:24:38.337 --> 01:24:46.901]  That's Owen Schroer with the bullhorn leading a massive column to greet the already huge crowds at the Capitol building that are threatening to break in.
[01:24:46.901 --> 01:24:50.703]  Evacuation orders being issued and the congressmen continue to object.
[01:24:50.703 --> 01:24:51.864]  This is incredible folks.
[01:24:51.864 --> 01:24:53.165]  Stay with us.
[01:24:53.165 --> 01:25:00.128]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:04.671]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[01:25:06.329 --> 01:25:09.815]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:14.925]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[01:25:14.925 --> 01:25:19.172]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[01:25:20.567 --> 01:25:30.173]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:25:30.173 --> 01:25:34.296]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:40.780]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:46.324]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[01:25:46.324 --> 01:25:47.745]  So help me God.
[01:25:47.745 --> 01:25:48.505]  Infowars.com
[01:25:52.529 --> 01:26:01.316]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[01:26:01.316 --> 01:26:08.102]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in it.
[01:26:08.502 --> 01:26:09.723]  This does not have the fluoride.
[01:26:09.723 --> 01:26:11.124]  It doesn't have the additives.
[01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:12.345]  This is a concentrate.
[01:26:12.345 --> 01:26:13.806]  It really is high quality.
[01:26:13.806 --> 01:26:18.970]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:20.752]  But now it's back in stock.
[01:26:20.752 --> 01:26:25.175]  InfoWars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.

[01:26:37.745 --> 01:26:37.986]  Thank you.
[01:26:52.532 --> 01:26:56.774]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming.
[01:26:56.774 --> 01:27:00.376]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[01:27:00.376 --> 01:27:05.619]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[01:27:05.619 --> 01:27:12.463]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices, and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[01:27:12.463 --> 01:27:15.904]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[01:27:15.904 --> 01:27:18.186]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[01:27:18.186 --> 01:27:20.627]  The globalists are waging siege against us.
[01:27:21.067 --> 01:27:25.989]  Trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[01:27:25.989 --> 01:27:30.651]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:42.036]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at preparewithalex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storable foods out there.

[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.741]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:22.932]  This is a historic day, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:22.932 --> 01:28:24.393]  Incredible things happening.
[01:28:24.393 --> 01:28:26.194]  They are storming D.C.
[01:28:26.194 --> 01:28:29.816]  Patriots are rushing and surrounding the Capitol.
[01:28:29.816 --> 01:28:31.457]  They're tearing down barriers.
[01:28:31.457 --> 01:28:33.858]  Police are struggling to maintain the crowd.
[01:28:33.858 --> 01:28:37.020]  Mace and punches being thrown back and forth.
[01:28:37.697 --> 01:28:41.500]  Two House buildings have been evacuated.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:47.344]  The House Cannon Building and the House Madison Building have both been issued evacuation orders.
[01:28:47.344 --> 01:28:57.032]  Pence has said he cannot reject electoral votes outright, but the Congress themselves are objecting right now to the Arizona votes.
[01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:04.117]  Videos coming out over Twitter and we'll bring you those just as soon as we can of the
[01:29:04.898 --> 01:29:21.583]  Conflict, the combat actually going on with the Capitol Police being pushed back, barriers being torn down, and patriots waving Trump flags, American flags, don't tread on me flags, the Gadsden flag, all moving inexorably towards the Capitol building.
[01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:28.265]  Alex Jones and Owen Schroer at the head of a second column of humanity moving towards the Capitol building, less than a mile away now.
[01:29:28.265 --> 01:29:31.826]  There's the evacuation order you see from the United States Capitol Police.
[01:29:32.586 --> 01:29:35.087]  Evacuate Madison building due to police activity.
[01:29:35.087 --> 01:29:38.748]  Occupants should remain calm and move in a safe manner to the exits.
[01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:42.249]  If nearby, take enunciators on the way out.
[01:29:42.249 --> 01:29:43.730]  Close doors behind you but do not lock.
[01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:47.291]  Proceed immediately to your designated assembly area and check in with your OEC.
[01:29:48.391 --> 01:30:10.896]  Orders being issued to the members of the House and anybody there in the Capitol building, that's the Madison building and the Cannon building, both received evacuation orders as a consequence of this massive humanity that continues to blast their way through the flimsy barriers preventing them from getting close to the Capitol.
[01:30:10.896 --> 01:30:12.037]  Incredible stuff, folks.
[01:30:12.037 --> 01:30:12.957]  Here we're seeing videos.
[01:30:13.797 --> 01:30:13.957]  That's
[01:30:33.277 --> 01:30:35.118]  Perhaps they've finally boiled over.
[01:30:35.118 --> 01:30:45.467]  You see the air filled with the mist of mace, the stinging gas that the police will be implementing and that is also being implemented against the police as patriots
[01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.852]  Wow, we're receiving blows to the head from Billy Clubs.
[01:30:49.852 --> 01:30:51.833]  Attempts to tear down barriers.
[01:30:51.833 --> 01:31:01.417]  Once again, folks, this is but a small fraction of the upwards of a million people that are now in Washington, D.C., with the vast majority of them just now moving towards the Capitol.
[01:31:01.417 --> 01:31:05.479]  We expect this situation to become ever more dire.
[01:31:05.479 --> 01:31:08.541]  Here we see, once again, moving past what looks like
[01:31:09.181 --> 01:31:09.602]  We're good to go.
[01:31:29.505 --> 01:31:33.788]  Completely live feeds right now, but we're getting them about as quickly as we can.
[01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:38.831]  Fights have broken out between police officers and Trump supporters in front of the Capitol right now.
[01:31:38.831 --> 01:31:44.935]  Jim Jordan is objecting to counting the electoral votes from Arizona.
[01:31:44.935 --> 01:31:49.638]  Let's go down to Jim Jordan and hear what he has to say.
[01:31:49.638 --> 01:31:51.920]  What if it's 10 states next time?
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.320]  What if it's 15?
[01:31:53.697 --> 01:31:56.678]  What if in 2024, 2028, it's 26 states?
[01:31:56.678 --> 01:31:58.278]  What if it's half the states?
[01:31:58.278 --> 01:32:02.760]  Do an end run while the Constitution clearly spells out.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:06.621]  We, we're the final check and balance.
[01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:09.101]  The authority rests with us.
[01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:14.503]  The United States Congress, the body closest to the American people, right where the founders wanted it.
[01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:17.131]  We should do our duty.
[01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:23.180]  We should object to and vote for this objection to the Arizona electors.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.041]  Madam Chair, I yield back.
[01:32:25.216 --> 01:32:26.957]  Thank you.
[01:32:55.376 --> 01:33:02.020]  American nationalists on Twitter asking President Trump to storm the Senate chamber.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:07.984]  This day is young, folks, and who knows what the future holds for us.
[01:33:07.984 --> 01:33:14.489]  Again, Elijah Schaefer reports patriots have stormed the Capitol building, ground, and are breaching federal barriers and police en masse.
[01:33:15.129 --> 01:33:16.831]  No cell service, video incoming.
[01:33:16.831 --> 01:33:17.812]  Of course, we've seen that video.
[01:33:17.812 --> 01:33:19.013]  We played it for you here.
[01:33:19.013 --> 01:33:21.256]  Non-lethal force in effect.
[01:33:21.256 --> 01:33:29.565]  The barriers are continually being assaulted by the Patriots as they move ever closer and surround an ever greater number.
[01:33:29.565 --> 01:33:31.547]  The Capitol building in Washington, D.C.
[01:33:31.547 --> 01:33:33.208]  punches, mace being thrown.
[01:33:34.049 --> 01:33:45.476]  And again, the only thing preventing us from getting more videos right now is the fact that the sheer mass of humanity overloads the cell phone towers and it becomes impossible to get access to the internet or even to call in.
[01:33:45.476 --> 01:33:50.360]  We're going to try to get the stream of Alex Jones and Owen Troyer as they continue to approach.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.161]  It looks like blood on the ground.
[01:33:52.161 --> 01:33:58.325]  I'm not sure if that's blood or something else, but it looked like a great deal of human blood on the ground in front of the police line.
[01:33:59.105 --> 01:34:03.708]  As police continue to lash out and attack, they're in full riot gear, full armor.
[01:34:03.708 --> 01:34:09.872]  Patriots, no sign of stepping back or slowing down as they continue to push towards these police lines.
[01:34:09.872 --> 01:34:13.675]  Of course, inside this building right now, the debate rages.
[01:34:13.675 --> 01:34:19.579]  Adam Schiff presenting some sort of illiterate nonsense that we don't need to hear.
[01:34:19.579 --> 01:34:20.939]  Patriots storming the U.S.
[01:34:20.939 --> 01:34:21.660]  Capitol.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:27.424]  An amazing video from the real Hurstie via Kitty Boomhauer on Twitter.
[01:34:28.024 --> 01:34:44.288]  These are the people we rely on to get this up-to-date video because, folks, if you were watching Fox News or Newsmax or CNN, you would receive nothing but a bland feed of essentially nothing going on.
[01:34:44.288 --> 01:34:54.331]  Instead, we are giving you live, up-to-the-minute videos that are coming through over Twitter from the live independent reporters there on the ground.
[01:34:55.862 --> 01:34:59.943]  Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people right now moving towards the Capitol.
[01:34:59.943 --> 01:35:13.006]  The mass of humanity continues to grow as the police lash out their thin line of armored officers, a pitiful resistance against the literal tidal wave moving towards them.
[01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:18.888]  And we'll continue to monitor all of this and get more videos as well, folks.
[01:35:18.888 --> 01:35:23.549]  Guys, do we have a feed of Alex and Owen moving towards or has that gone down because of the cell phones?
[01:35:26.994 --> 01:35:29.716]  This is all up to the minute, folks.
[01:35:29.716 --> 01:35:34.300]  The crew is working frantically behind the scenes to get all of this up to date.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.484]  Once again, this is coverage that you will not get anywhere else.
[01:35:38.484 --> 01:35:43.368]  And all of this broke out almost immediately following President Trump's statements.
[01:35:43.368 --> 01:35:45.670]  Is this the live feed of Alex and Owen?
[01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:46.111]  Can we hear them?
[01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:53.392]  And you see the crowd moving towards the Capitol now.
[01:35:53.392 --> 01:36:03.399]  Owen and Alex at the head of a column of humanity going to join the already hundreds if not thousands of people now surrounding the Capitol and pushing ever closer.
[01:36:03.399 --> 01:36:05.881]  The Capitol has evacuated two buildings.
[01:36:05.881 --> 01:36:18.209]  The Cannon Building and the Madison Building have received evacuation orders and the people inside have been told to move calmly but swiftly towards the exit and to notify their superiors that they are safe.
[01:36:18.209 --> 01:36:18.950]  Folks, this is
[01:36:20.411 --> 01:36:26.275]  This is truly incredible and we'll continue to keep you updated here.
[01:36:26.275 --> 01:36:27.837]  Looks like Chuck Schumer now?
[01:36:27.837 --> 01:36:30.019]  No, it's still Adam Schiff still.
[01:36:30.019 --> 01:36:31.520]  Adam Schiff addressing the crowd.
[01:36:33.385 --> 01:36:34.626]  And do we have audio of that stream?
[01:36:34.626 --> 01:36:37.628]  If we can bring that up and hear what Owen and Alex are saying.
[01:37:02.606 --> 01:37:04.551]  Let's just wait.
[01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:08.920]  Let's not stand too much and get in the crowd.
[01:37:22.685 --> 01:37:26.929]  Surrounding Alex Jones and Owen Schroer and the rest of the InfoWars crew as they move towards the Capitol.
[01:37:26.929 --> 01:37:33.596]  Here we see a view from inside the Capitol of staffers there moving down the stairs following that evacuation order.
[01:37:34.136 --> 01:37:35.037]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[01:37:35.037 --> 01:37:35.717]  Thank you for holding.
[01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:36.498]  How you doing Alex?
[01:37:56.434 --> 01:37:57.835]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[01:37:57.835 --> 01:37:59.035]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[01:37:59.035 --> 01:37:59.796]  How are you?
[01:37:59.796 --> 01:38:00.596]  I love you, man.
[01:38:00.596 --> 01:38:02.898]  I want to make a quick plug.
[01:38:02.898 --> 01:38:04.799]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[01:38:04.799 --> 01:38:21.248]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[01:38:21.903 --> 01:38:27.308]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[01:38:27.308 --> 01:38:40.820]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:45.524]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[01:38:45.524 --> 01:38:46.986]  So thanks for the plug.
[01:38:52.069 --> 01:38:55.751]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[01:38:55.751 --> 01:39:05.437]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the cub as the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[01:39:05.437 --> 01:39:08.699]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[01:39:08.699 --> 01:39:11.321]  That's why you see somebody dying in southern nursing homes.
[01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:20.907]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones,
[01:39:21.187 --> 01:39:23.328]  Are basically bioweapons and are super deadly.
[01:39:23.328 --> 01:39:26.570]  And now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically.
[01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:29.812]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they get vaccines.
[01:39:29.812 --> 01:39:32.794]  They have to resuscitate them all the time, or a lot of times they just let them die.
[01:39:32.794 --> 01:39:34.855]  And that's on the record, it does that.
[01:39:34.855 --> 01:39:38.377]  Guillain-Barré's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases.
[01:39:38.377 --> 01:39:39.678]  But they tell you it's safe and effective.
[01:39:39.678 --> 01:39:40.378]  No one's getting hurt.
[01:39:40.378 --> 01:39:41.579]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:39:41.579 --> 01:39:45.161]  And then all the fine print says can kill you absolutely deadly.
[01:39:45.161 --> 01:39:48.903]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous.
[01:39:48.903 --> 01:39:50.704]  Because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[01:39:52.774 --> 01:39:55.858]  It's back in stock.
[01:39:55.858 --> 01:39:57.340]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:00.423]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[01:40:00.423 --> 01:40:01.745]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[01:40:01.745 --> 01:40:11.316]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines and it's clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[01:40:11.816 --> 01:40:12.977]  It's amazing.
[01:40:12.977 --> 01:40:14.458]  Folks absolutely love it.
[01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:17.380]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.242]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[01:40:20.242 --> 01:40:22.203]  25% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:22.203 --> 01:40:25.965]  Pollen Block, again, is available in this one-minute ad.
[01:40:25.965 --> 01:40:35.672]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable.
[01:40:36.172 --> 01:40:36.532]  I don't know.
[01:40:53.103 --> 01:40:54.183]  The Great Reset is here.
[01:40:54.183 --> 01:41:07.986]  The world government has openly been announced, and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family, and to make you so poor, you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income, forced inoculations, and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist, globalist system.
[01:41:07.986 --> 01:41:20.568]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active, and get prepared for self-defense, and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need, so you're not dependent on the system.
[01:41:20.748 --> 01:41:23.629]  We have the best storable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:26.171]  All the other big competitors have already gone up on their prices.
[01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:30.093]  But our supplier has high quality food in stock ready to ship to you.
[01:41:30.093 --> 01:41:32.894]  And by January 8th, they're going to have to raise prices some.
[01:41:32.894 --> 01:41:34.015]  So take advantage now.
[01:41:34.015 --> 01:41:35.656]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:41.318]  And on top of that, you can save up to $850 off their regular rates.
[01:41:41.318 --> 01:41:43.419]  Go to PrepareWithAlex.com today.
[01:41:43.419 --> 01:41:45.120]  You've got until January 8th.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.363]  And the profit that comes in then helps fund the InfoWar, fighting for America, fighting for justice, fighting for freedom.
[01:41:50.643 --> 01:41:55.531]  A true 360 win.
[01:41:55.531 --> 01:41:58.135]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:16.135 --> 01:42:18.697]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is truly incredible.
[01:42:18.697 --> 01:42:30.049]  Alex Jones and Owen Schroer at the head of a column of patriots moving towards the area where Donald Trump has just completed his speech to the Save America crowd there.
[01:42:30.049 --> 01:42:39.458]  My guess, upwards of a million people on the streets of Washington, D.C., already hundreds of thousands surrounding the Capitol, where inside the debate rages over whether or not to accept
[01:42:39.818 --> 01:42:42.982]  The electoral votes from the state of Arizona.
[01:42:42.982 --> 01:42:52.252]  This is just the beginning and as the debate rages inside outside police are struggling to maintain the fury of the crowds as barricades are pulled down.
[01:42:52.252 --> 01:42:54.535]  Mace is sprayed back and forth.
[01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:57.798]  Punches being thrown by both sides in what looks like
[01:42:58.479 --> 01:43:03.522]  Well, it looks to be the beginning of something huge, folks.
[01:43:03.522 --> 01:43:12.628]  We are receiving video updates from independent reporters on the ground and across the entire country as a rally at the Minnesota Statehouse in St.
[01:43:12.628 --> 01:43:15.410]  Paul has surrounded the Capitol building there.
[01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:26.521]  And again, Alex Jones and Owen Schroer moving towards that Capitol with the rest of this massive crowd, which by the time Trump was still speaking, had already surrounded the Capitol building.
[01:43:26.521 --> 01:43:29.664]  Two of the Capitol buildings have been evacuated.
[01:43:29.664 --> 01:43:38.093]  The Madison building and the House Cannon building have both received evacuation orders and the staffers there have moved towards the exit as the
[01:43:39.474 --> 01:43:47.898]  Capitol Police feel like they may not be able to maintain the security or integrity of their police line.
[01:43:47.898 --> 01:43:51.060]  Here we see applause taking place in the Senate.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.301]  We've heard from Jim Jordan.
[01:43:52.301 --> 01:43:54.542]  We've heard from Steve Scalise.
[01:43:54.542 --> 01:44:02.246]  Now there's this scumbag, which I think something bad happened to him, so now everybody's sad for him, but let's not forget he's a traitorous scumbag in the end.
[01:44:02.526 --> 01:44:04.669]  I can't even remember his name, but frankly, I don't care to.
[01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:10.495]  Here you see in the bottom right hand of the screen, the Capitol Building staffers moving towards the exit.
[01:44:10.495 --> 01:44:12.558]  Clearly, they don't seem distressed.
[01:44:12.558 --> 01:44:13.238]  Nobody's running.
[01:44:13.238 --> 01:44:17.163]  They're all moving slowly, looking at their phones or filming with their cameras.
[01:44:17.743 --> 01:44:33.164]  But still, this is an incredible event and once again it was a small fraction of a fraction of the total crowd that was already at this Capitol building when the conflict began and now the remainder of that huge, almost unprecedented crowd is moving towards
[01:44:34.722 --> 01:44:34.922]  I think?
[01:44:59.947 --> 01:45:07.832]  Once again, inexorably towards the Capitol building, the police seem to be scrambling, running back and forth, unsure which way to go.
[01:45:07.832 --> 01:45:17.679]  And Trump flags waving, American flags waving, Gadsden flags waving, and the joyous, you know, upbeat
[01:45:18.797 --> 01:45:33.407]  The atmosphere of the event earlier today has soured and turned to rage as the fury of Trump supporters and patriots across the United States overflows and expresses itself on the outside of the Capitol.
[01:45:33.407 --> 01:45:39.671]  It looks like Ted Cruz is now addressing the House.
[01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:41.933]  We'd like to get that feed as soon as possible.
[01:45:41.933 --> 01:45:46.416]  An aerial view provided by Fox shows the massive and ever-growing crowd.
[01:45:49.338 --> 01:45:53.583]  Alex Jones continuing to move towards the Capitol there.
[01:45:53.583 --> 01:45:55.745]  One of the only issues that's preventing us from
[01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:09.658]  Getting more live feeds is the fact that the sheer number of people overloads the cell phone towers and internet connections become inconsistent at best, but the massive crowd continues to grow.
[01:46:09.658 --> 01:46:10.358]  A U.S.
[01:46:10.358 --> 01:46:15.302]  bomb squad battalion dispatch has arrived on the scene as well.
[01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:21.966]  We're not sure if that's because of a reported bomb threat or whether they're just there as backup, as it seems like the U.S.
[01:46:21.966 --> 01:46:25.989]  Capitol Police are struggling to maintain their cohesion.
[01:46:27.029 --> 01:46:39.765]  As more and more people surround the Capitol building and push towards those Senate and Congressional chambers where, as we speak, objections are being made to the fraudulent vote that occurred in Arizona.
[01:46:39.765 --> 01:46:41.207]  Two buildings of the U.S.
[01:46:41.207 --> 01:46:44.131]  Capitol complex evacuated, of course.
[01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:50.351]  And once again, it looks like the supply of videos has slowed down a bit.
[01:46:50.351 --> 01:46:52.571]  We'll keep pulling them in as we can.
[01:46:52.571 --> 01:46:57.913]  Oh, here we see Trump supporters running as they move towards the Capitol.
[01:46:57.913 --> 01:47:04.115]  It looks like these stands have already been erected for the supposed inauguration, which should be happening on January 20th.
[01:47:04.115 --> 01:47:08.356]  That's where you see some of the preparations being made outside the Capitol.
[01:47:08.356 --> 01:47:09.617]  And now
[01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:11.250]  I think?
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:38.082]  For the inauguration on January 20th, it looks like Ted Cruz has objected.
[01:47:38.082 --> 01:47:45.025]  Breaking now from Hannity.com, Ted Cruz objects to Arizona's Electoral College results, Senate to debate.
[01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:48.826]  So as we speak, the Senate and the Congress are both in session.
[01:47:48.826 --> 01:47:50.087]  It's a joint session of Congress.
[01:47:50.087 --> 01:47:55.589]  They are deciding whether or not to accept the results that have been put forward
[01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.489]  to them.
[01:48:18.517 --> 01:48:28.848]  Vice President Mike Pence was in a position to outright object and decide on his own based on some constitutional precedents set over 100 years ago.
[01:48:28.848 --> 01:48:33.412]  He has rejected that responsibility, that obligation.
[01:48:33.412 --> 01:48:35.174]  He said, no, I can't do that.
[01:48:35.174 --> 01:48:36.936]  I have to leave it up to the legislature.
[01:48:36.936 --> 01:48:39.638]  So now we have legislatures and senators
[01:48:40.757 --> 01:48:50.722]  Arguing in favor or in opposition to the acceptance of the electoral slates that have been sent from these various states.
[01:48:50.722 --> 01:49:01.067]  And once again, we're seeing rallies all across the United States with a rally in Minnesota and elsewhere breaking up, breaking off as well.
[01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:05.049]  And again, these videos coming out from outside the Capitol show a
[01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:17.418]  Very thin police line, heavily armored with the masks, the SWAT helmets, the SWAT shields, full body armor, carrying billy clubs that look to be about three feet long.
[01:49:17.418 --> 01:49:22.803]  We're seeing Trump supporters taking hits on the head from those billy clubs.
[01:49:22.803 --> 01:49:33.292]  And again, this was as of 24 minutes ago, and since then we've seen 24 minutes of rising aggression, rising crowds, more police, building evacuations.
[01:49:35.273 --> 01:49:42.521]  And the reaction from across the nation is largely excitement as far as I'm concerned.
[01:49:42.521 --> 01:49:47.846]  This is again truly incredible and we'll continue to update and bring you more videos.
[01:49:48.729 --> 01:49:52.853]  We're not exactly sure where Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones have arrived at this point.
[01:49:52.853 --> 01:49:59.478]  They were about a mile away, probably 20 minutes ago, so they should be approaching the Capitol now.
[01:49:59.478 --> 01:50:11.309]  Problem is, once again, not only have the cell phone towers been overloaded by the sheer mass of humanity, all of their cell phones attempting to get a piece of those networks, and they inevitably go down.
[01:50:11.309 --> 01:50:12.229]  That's to be expected.
[01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:24.121]  What I've noticed is that we haven't received a new video in about nine minutes and I wonder if there hasn't been some sort of shutdown of the cell network to prevent information from getting out.
[01:50:24.121 --> 01:50:28.466]  But we continue to monitor the situation on every different front.
[01:50:28.466 --> 01:50:31.769]  If you guys want to bring up this Fox News feed we can at least see, oh here's a shot
[01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:40.762]  from the back of the Capitol grounds shooting towards the place where the inauguration is set to commence on January 20th.
[01:50:40.762 --> 01:50:43.005]  Massive, massive crowds again moving.
[01:50:43.005 --> 01:50:44.086]  We see police running.
[01:50:44.086 --> 01:50:47.271]  We see Capitol staffers evacuating.
[01:50:48.052 --> 01:51:06.000]  As the Trump flags wave, the American flags wave, the Gadsden flags wave, and the Patriots move ever closer, we see police being helped away from the scene, perhaps injured, perhaps sprayed with mace, perhaps a friendly fire of mace from his own side getting back in his own eyes.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.723]  We've seen mostly mace being sprayed from the police lines, but we've also seen mace being sprayed right back from the Trump supporters towards the police.
[01:51:13.363 --> 01:51:21.905]  And this is an ongoing situation as the crowd continues to swell, continues to surround the Capitol, and the police are struggling to maintain it.
[01:51:24.279 --> 01:51:27.160]  This is unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:36.384]  This is perhaps the focal point, the changing point, the fulcrum upon which the fate of the Republic rests.
[01:51:36.384 --> 01:51:46.047]  More senators and congressmen objecting, police it looks like being escorted off, perhaps injured, being assisted by their fellow officers.
[01:51:46.607 --> 01:51:51.210]  We don't know if they have received a blow to the face or if they've been maced.
[01:51:51.210 --> 01:52:07.980]  What we do know is that the Washington establishment is scrambling any and all officers they have at their command in order to deal with this massive outpouring of anger, fury, and righteous indignation coming from the Trump supporters.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:15.465]  You can there see we have the Fox News feed up and even they are having trouble maintaining the integrity of their signal.
[01:52:17.108 --> 01:52:20.169]  And we see some of their videos glitching and fading out.
[01:52:20.169 --> 01:52:21.710]  Folks, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:40.377]  My name is Harrison Smith because Alex Jones himself is on the scene and we will do our best to connect with him and Owen Schroer and to see what is going on as patriots scale the scaffolding, the barriers come down, and the righteous fury of the American people overwhelms the pathetic structure of this corrupt system.
[01:52:41.989 --> 01:52:45.110]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:48.971]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[01:52:48.971 --> 01:52:58.835]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[01:52:58.835 --> 01:53:00.876]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[01:53:00.876 --> 01:53:02.996]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[01:53:02.996 --> 01:53:05.337]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[01:53:05.337 --> 01:53:07.638]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[01:53:08.078 --> 01:53:09.679]  This is economic domination.
[01:53:09.679 --> 01:53:11.001]  This is economic war.
[01:53:11.001 --> 01:53:12.022]  We are being consolidated.
[01:53:12.022 --> 01:53:13.243]  We are being taken over.
[01:53:13.243 --> 01:53:16.125]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[01:53:16.125 --> 01:53:25.994]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[01:53:25.994 --> 01:53:27.855]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[01:53:27.855 --> 01:53:29.217]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[01:53:29.217 --> 01:53:31.398]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[01:53:32.099 --> 01:53:33.723]  That's what social distancing is.
[01:53:33.723 --> 01:53:37.170]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:39.355]  No small businesses will be there.
[01:53:39.355 --> 01:53:40.537]  This is a master plan.
[01:53:40.537 --> 01:53:40.878]  Say no!
[01:53:43.004 --> 01:53:45.365]  The post-industrial world.
[01:53:45.365 --> 01:53:54.628]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[01:53:54.628 --> 01:53:59.130]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:05.012]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[01:54:07.853 --> 01:54:10.876]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[01:54:10.876 --> 01:54:13.999]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[01:54:13.999 --> 01:54:15.961]  It is making the population poor.
[01:54:15.961 --> 01:54:21.886]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[01:54:21.886 --> 01:54:25.189]  They are destroying civilization, rebuilding, and they're dystopic.
[01:54:26.150 --> 01:54:29.592]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:54:59.725 --> 01:55:01.046]  Folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:01.046 --> 01:55:04.469]  What an incredible day to be on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:04.469 --> 01:55:09.352]  What we're seeing now are up-to-the-minute videos.
[01:55:09.352 --> 01:55:10.733]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[01:55:10.733 --> 01:55:16.076]  Looks like blood on the ground, bear mace being sprayed, some sort of other
[01:55:17.091 --> 01:55:21.335]  Material being sprayed over the Capitol Police, going back and forth.
[01:55:21.335 --> 01:55:24.377]  We have an update about the evacuation.
[01:55:24.377 --> 01:55:39.750]  The story is that a pipe bomb was recorded, hence the evacuation of the two Capitol Hill buildings, although it's been all cleared now and Congressional staffers or Capitol staffers are now reporting that they got the all clear in order to head back in.
[01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:57.613]  Perhaps that evacuation was not as a response to the crowd which continues to hammer at and get in conflict with this thin line of riot police fully armored up like medieval knights here in their full body armor, their face masks, their helmets, and their massive billy club.
[01:55:57.613 --> 01:56:03.155]  You can see them dragging Trump supporters away from the other patriots as they arrest them.
[01:56:03.155 --> 01:56:05.215]  Arrests are being made.
[01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:06.935]  Billy clubs are being used.
[01:56:06.935 --> 01:56:09.636]  Riot shields are in place and pushing back
[01:56:10.356 --> 01:56:10.636]  I don't
[01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:26.139]  I think?
[01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:49.853]  Wooden cross has now been erected at the foot of the Capitol steps.
[01:56:49.853 --> 01:56:52.515]  It's at least 20 feet tall.
[01:56:52.515 --> 01:56:53.415]  Truly incredible.
[01:56:53.415 --> 01:56:54.456]  And that's real wood.
[01:56:54.456 --> 01:56:58.479]  I mean, you can tell from the weight as they leverage it up and into the stand.
[01:56:58.479 --> 01:57:01.661]  That is not made out of styrofoam, folks.
[01:57:01.661 --> 01:57:13.268]  That's a heavy wooden cross being erected as a symbol of defiance to the Satanist pedophile networks that are attempting at this very moment to overthrow our
[01:57:14.569 --> 01:57:16.470]  Ability to govern ourselves.
[01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:19.411]  And it looks like this is perhaps at the Capitol building at Madison.
[01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:20.591]  Am I wrong in that?
[01:57:20.591 --> 01:57:22.792]  This is Wisconsin.
[01:57:22.792 --> 01:57:25.533]  Where is it?
[01:57:25.533 --> 01:57:26.033]  Bethany?
[01:57:26.033 --> 01:57:28.134]  Where?
[01:57:28.134 --> 01:57:29.134]  Oh, today is Epiphany.
[01:57:29.134 --> 01:57:29.454]  Okay.
[01:57:29.454 --> 01:57:29.834]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.834 --> 01:57:32.415]  Well, hey, symbolic significance there.
[01:57:32.415 --> 01:57:33.135]  I believe that.
[01:57:33.135 --> 01:57:39.197]  So right now we have all over America, massive protests breaking out at Capitol buildings, at states all over the place.
[01:57:39.197 --> 01:57:43.399]  I believe that was a different one because I saw snow on the ground there, which I believe
[01:57:44.378 --> 01:57:50.802]  It must have come from the capital, but it's not the U.S.
[01:57:50.802 --> 01:57:51.203]  capital.
[01:57:51.203 --> 01:57:53.384]  It's not the American capital.
[01:57:53.384 --> 01:57:54.465]  The D.C.
[01:57:54.465 --> 01:57:57.707]  capital, I think that is.
[01:57:57.707 --> 01:58:01.109]  Probably Madison, but we'll figure that out.
[01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:04.812]  Los Angeles as well, a Stop the Steal rally lining the streets.
[01:58:04.812 --> 01:58:06.233]  Hundreds of Trump supporters.
[01:58:08.249 --> 01:58:15.493]  People cheering it on on Twitter saying, saying drag him out, saying go into the Capitol building and drag the traitors out.
[01:58:15.493 --> 01:58:29.361]  As things continue to escalate here from Julio Rosas, Capitol Police pushed the Trump supporters back and used a lot of pepper spray as more videos are being posted by him and other independent reporters.
[01:58:29.361 --> 01:58:34.765]  Now, meanwhile, if you're going to be watching something like Fox News or CNN, all you're going to see is one of two things.
[01:58:34.765 --> 01:58:36.245]  You're either going to see a very
[01:58:38.198 --> 01:58:38.759]  I don't know.
[01:58:58.121 --> 01:59:02.624]  And in both the Senate and the Congress, arguments are being made back and forth.
[01:59:02.624 --> 01:59:08.147]  We heard that Congresswoman Boebert was interrupted, and we're trying to figure out what that was about.
[01:59:08.147 --> 01:59:09.408]  It looked like some contention there.
[01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:14.571]  She was speaking and objecting, and then she was forced to stop and sat down and was speaking up.
[01:59:14.571 --> 01:59:20.695]  And we'll try to figure out what was going on there, whether rules were violated, whether she was prevented from presenting her case.
[01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:23.477]  But we'll continue to bring all of this to you up to the minute.
[01:59:23.997 --> 01:59:32.081]  And we'll get a live feed from the InfoWars crews there on the ground at this crucible moment, as General Flynn put it.
[01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:48.888]  Folks, I haven't plugged once, but hey, in the last 15 seconds of this segment, InfoWarsStore.com is what is supporting all of this, everything that we're seeing here, reporting that you will not get anywhere else on network TV, on the internet, nowhere else is bringing you this type of material and the video straight from the Capitol.
[01:59:48.888 --> 01:59:49.829]  This is amazing, folks.
[01:59:49.829 --> 01:59:50.209]  Stay with us.
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:58.682]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in floors are no longer available.
[01:59:58.682 --> 02:00:06.544]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[02:00:06.544 --> 02:00:08.604]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[02:00:08.604 --> 02:00:14.386]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[02:00:14.386 --> 02:00:18.847]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[02:00:19.207 --> 02:00:24.330]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:28.693]  And by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months, it's now back in stock as well.

[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.041]  It's concentrated.
[02:00:40.041 --> 02:00:41.102]  People love it.
[02:00:41.102 --> 02:00:41.782]  It's amazing.
[02:00:41.782 --> 02:00:43.343]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[02:00:43.343 --> 02:00:45.144]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[02:00:45.144 --> 02:00:47.026]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:00:49.087 --> 02:00:49.734]  We're good.
[02:01:01.594 --> 02:01:12.400]  Alright folks, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.342]  I'm Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones because Alex Jones right now is on the ground in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:17.342 --> 02:01:20.044]  as more and more Patriots pour towards the Capitol building.
[02:01:20.044 --> 02:01:26.707]  It looks like our feed, our live feed from the Capitol with Alex Jones is back up again.
[02:01:26.707 --> 02:01:29.289]  Once again, the sheer number of people there
[02:01:30.309 --> 02:01:30.770]  We're good to go.
[02:01:48.021 --> 02:01:54.747]  There are people such as Dana Lash saying stop this to Trump supporters who are moving towards the Capitol.
[02:01:54.747 --> 02:01:57.149]  Other people saying get in there and tear them out.
[02:01:57.149 --> 02:02:00.512]  Oh, here we see, my God, these images are just incredible.
[02:02:00.512 --> 02:02:04.135]  Massive numbers of patriots storming the Capitol building.
[02:02:04.135 --> 02:02:14.063]  Texas flags waving, American flags waving, and masses of humanity have apparently broken past the police barricades which were keeping them off the steps and away from the Capitol building.
[02:02:15.684 --> 02:02:44.240]  Torn down and the people have moved on to that raised platform and are scaling the Scaffolding that was set up previously for the inauguration that is to take place on January 20th here We see the flash bangs and the gas grenades being launched over the heads of the front lines into the ranks of the Patriots Really really incredible again, this is all up-to-the-minute stuff taking place
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:51.229]  And we'll bring it to you all just as quickly as possible.
[02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:58.179]  The barricade, oh my gosh, yeah, images of barricades completely torn and ripped apart, laying on the ground as patriots moved past it.
[02:02:59.172 --> 02:03:03.253]  We've got views of the Patriots at the steps of the Capitol building.
[02:03:03.253 --> 02:03:26.078]  And yes, I do have it confirmed that it's the Michigan Capitol building, in front of which this massive wooden cross has been raised by Christian Patriots who are sick and tired of their heritage, their religion, their belief system being denigrated and desecrated by the satanic forces that have occupied our great country.
[02:03:26.698 --> 02:03:42.308]  So, in a symbol of defiance to the worldly, secular, ruling class, a massive wooden cross has been erected in front of the Capitol building in the state of Michigan as protests erupt throughout the country.
[02:03:44.375 --> 02:03:45.816]  I think
[02:04:14.535 --> 02:04:30.650]  Here we see a view from earlier today during President Trump's speech of just the innumerable Trump supporters waving flags and they're in support of the president and in defiance of what we're told was a completely fair election.
[02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:33.233]  The most secure election of all time.
[02:04:33.233 --> 02:04:34.774]  Those lies no longer hold weight.
[02:04:34.774 --> 02:04:39.919]  They no longer carry water with the vast majority of Americans in this country.
[02:04:41.089 --> 02:04:41.549]  Let's go again.
[02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:46.253]  Do we have that feed from Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer as they're there live on the ground?
[02:04:46.253 --> 02:04:48.494]  We'll bring you that just as soon as it gets back up.
[02:04:48.494 --> 02:04:48.895]  Here it is.
[02:04:48.895 --> 02:04:51.176]  I don't know if we want to go to it quite yet though.
[02:04:59.382 --> 02:05:00.643]  Here's the thing, folks.
[02:05:00.643 --> 02:05:03.184]  We are more aware of what's happening than they are right now.
[02:05:03.184 --> 02:05:13.050]  They may be on the ground, and we'll be getting their perspective just as soon as possible, and they'll have information that we don't have, but as of right now, we have the luxury of having eyes in many places.
[02:05:13.050 --> 02:05:27.719]  We're receiving videos, updates, and rumors and all sorts of stuff from various different corners all being aggregated here and then presented to you, whereas if you're on the ground, all you know is what you see for yourself, since
[02:05:28.559 --> 02:05:32.860]  With the overloaded cell systems, you're not going to be able to check Twitter if you're there.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:43.942]  So we're actually probably more aware of what's going on as a whole surrounding the entire Capitol than Alex Jones and Owen Schroeder are themselves, despite the fact that they're there on the ground.
[02:05:43.942 --> 02:05:51.543]  And we can just hear the rolling chants of USA, fight for Trump.
[02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:52.083]  Incredible.
[02:05:52.083 --> 02:05:55.964]  This crowd continues to swell.
[02:05:55.964 --> 02:05:56.424]  What was it?
[02:05:57.737 --> 02:05:58.918]  I've lost track of time.
[02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:17.957]  I think it was less than an hour ago, an hour ago, that President Trump finished his speech and that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands, probably upwards of a million people, surrounding the Washington Monument and all the way to the White House, finished watching that speech by President Trump and moved towards the U.S.
[02:06:17.957 --> 02:06:18.698]  Capitol.
[02:06:18.698 --> 02:06:19.939]  And by the time that
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.681]  Here we see an update from Ilhan Omar.
[02:06:23.681 --> 02:06:27.383]  Currently the Capitol buildings are locked down and everyone is sheltering in place.
[02:06:27.383 --> 02:06:29.244]  Hey, so look, that's where Ilhan Omar is, everyone.
[02:06:29.244 --> 02:06:31.605]  Just kidding.
[02:06:31.605 --> 02:06:36.027]  Massive crowds, yeah, you can see those in the distance.
[02:06:36.027 --> 02:06:37.087]  As they move towards Capitol.
[02:06:37.087 --> 02:06:44.711]  Once again, inside the Capitol building right now, a debate is raging as to whether or not to accept this fraudulent election.
[02:06:46.209 --> 02:06:46.769]  We're good to go.
[02:07:09.113 --> 02:07:11.055]  destruction taking place.
[02:07:11.055 --> 02:07:15.158]  Rioters have injured a Capital City police officer in front of the Capitol building.
[02:07:15.158 --> 02:07:20.663]  You saw that video earlier of the police being helped away from the crowd by his compatriots.
[02:07:20.663 --> 02:07:24.086]  We think that, to me, it looks like something got in his eyes.
[02:07:24.086 --> 02:07:25.427]  It looks like perhaps he got pepper sprayed.
[02:07:25.427 --> 02:07:29.850]  It may have been friendly fire or it may have been, oh, and here we have Carolyn Bremen.
[02:07:29.850 --> 02:07:32.873]  A view from inside the Capitol as people gather on the West Front.
[02:07:32.873 --> 02:07:34.834]  The Capitol is currently on lockdown.
[02:07:35.935 --> 02:07:39.578]  Massive crowds totally surrounding the Capitol.
[02:07:39.578 --> 02:07:43.061]  Angry Trump supporters aware of the fraud.
[02:07:43.061 --> 02:07:49.726]  Cognizant of the betrayal that is being carried out at this very moment inside the Capitol building.
[02:07:49.726 --> 02:07:58.213]  They continue to push forward, reorganize, regain footing and move ever forward.
[02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:10.260]  Once again, folks, the communication networks are completely overloaded with the sheer mass of people, so getting any first-hand information about this is going to be difficult.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:17.066]  But we'll continue to bring as up-to-the-minute updates as we possibly can.
[02:08:17.066 --> 02:08:21.310]  Protestors have breached police lines and are now on the steps of the U.S.
[02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:21.691]  Capitol.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:29.182]  Again, the rolling cheers of USA, USA, U.S.
[02:08:29.182 --> 02:08:33.385]  Capitol on lockdown now during the electoral vote count.
[02:08:33.385 --> 02:08:40.670]  And as far as we know, the vote count has stalled out at 12 for President Trump and zero for
[02:08:41.531 --> 02:08:50.716]  President, so-called President-elect Biden, as they only got through Alaska before Arizona was up, the objections came in and the debate began.
[02:08:50.716 --> 02:09:04.403]  We don't know if this debate will be continued and carried on as lockdown continues or whether they may pause and try to reassess what exactly is going on and how to deal with it.
[02:09:05.525 --> 02:09:11.270]  Of course, the congressmen and women and senators I don't think are at much of a threat.
[02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:14.412]  We know there's one thing they take very, very seriously.
[02:09:14.412 --> 02:09:17.595]  It is their own personal well-being and their own security.
[02:09:17.595 --> 02:09:23.719]  There are tunnels, of course, crisscrossing like spider webs throughout all of D.C.
[02:09:23.719 --> 02:09:30.745]  and there's almost no risk of them having to try to escape through a crowd or having to bunker down in the Capitol building.
[02:09:30.745 --> 02:09:32.006]  They have escape routes.
[02:09:32.766 --> 02:09:34.346]  Uh, more than they need.
[02:09:34.346 --> 02:09:39.608]  So, again, I do not think there's actually a bodily threat to anybody in the chambers at this moment.
[02:09:39.608 --> 02:09:40.748]  They don't seem too concerned.
[02:09:40.748 --> 02:09:49.670]  They're continuing to argue, continuing to debate, uh, without so much as a look over their shoulder as to, uh, the doors being broke down or anything like that.
[02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:58.192]  This is simply a, uh, massive protest that is refusing to stay quiet any longer, that is making themselves known, that is, uh,
[02:09:58.852 --> 02:10:11.216]  Not stopping at the barricades, not kowtowing and adhering to the police who have betrayed us time and time again, but instead are pushing forward to take over what is, at the heart of it, our building.
[02:10:11.216 --> 02:10:24.221]  It's our, as Americans, this building belongs to us, this Capitol belongs to us, and it is being stolen from us at this very minute, live, and the American people are attempting to prevent that from taking place.
[02:10:24.221 --> 02:10:28.082]  Once again, I don't believe that the people inside the Capitol building
[02:10:28.602 --> 02:10:32.984]  ...are concerned about this whatsoever, at least in terms of their safety or anything like that.
[02:10:32.984 --> 02:10:41.708]  If anything were to happen, if the doors were to be to breach, they would be evacuated rapidly, they'd disappear into underground tunnels, and be moved to a safe house far out of harm's way.
[02:10:41.708 --> 02:10:47.851]  So, we aren't too concerned for them, but we'll continue to keep you updated and bring you videos just as soon as we get them.
[02:10:49.707 --> 02:10:50.508]  Hey, everybody.
[02:10:50.508 --> 02:10:53.750]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:54.490]  Me too.
[02:10:54.490 --> 02:11:01.615]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[02:11:01.615 --> 02:11:06.018]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[02:11:06.018 --> 02:11:07.899]  You probably already believe that.
[02:11:07.899 --> 02:11:08.920]  I certainly do.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.860]  So here's the thing.
[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:18.186]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[02:11:18.746 --> 02:11:24.170]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[02:14:41.805 --> 02:14:44.287]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:14:53.625 --> 02:14:56.238]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:06.522 --> 02:15:09.746]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is history being made as we speak.
[02:15:09.746 --> 02:15:11.087]  Capitol on lockdown.
[02:15:11.087 --> 02:15:15.973]  The Capitol police over the radio are heard to say, we have lost control.
[02:15:15.973 --> 02:15:17.554]  I repeat, we have lost control.
[02:15:17.554 --> 02:15:24.342]  From Eliza Schaefer breaking, Trump supporters have breached all security barriers and are now actively destroying and occupying the Capitol building.
[02:15:24.782 --> 02:15:28.125]  I repeat, the Feds have lost control of the Capitol building.
[02:15:28.125 --> 02:15:29.906]  A revolution is in progress.
[02:15:29.906 --> 02:15:31.567]  This is not a drill.
[02:15:31.567 --> 02:15:38.893]  Trump supporters breaching all security barriers and are now actively destroying and occupying the Capitol building.
[02:15:38.893 --> 02:15:39.953]  This is incredible.
[02:15:39.953 --> 02:15:40.914]  Two buildings of the U.S.
[02:15:40.914 --> 02:15:45.397]  Capitol complex evacuated as Trump supporters clash with the police.
[02:15:45.397 --> 02:15:50.801]  Flashbangs being fired over the front lines into the crowd of Trump supporters.
[02:15:50.801 --> 02:15:53.924]  But it seems like those attempts to prevent the
[02:15:54.424 --> 02:15:54.825]  All right.
[02:16:16.388 --> 02:16:18.230]  Continue to occupy it.
[02:16:18.230 --> 02:16:30.240]  Here we're seeing a live view from inside the Capitol building, perhaps from a staffer, as they look at the thin line, the thin barrier of wood and glass separating them from hordes of angry Americans.
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:30.480]  U.S.
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.702]  Capitol on total lockdown.
[02:16:32.702 --> 02:16:37.987]  Certification vote has been paused as protests continue to erupt.
[02:16:37.987 --> 02:16:40.389]  The Senate has adjourned abruptly.
[02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:43.011]  Vice President Mike Pence has been rushed off the Senate floor.
[02:16:44.292 --> 02:16:45.652]  Trump supporters have breached the U.S.
[02:16:45.652 --> 02:16:46.373]  Capitol building.
[02:16:46.373 --> 02:16:55.895]  We're seeing images within the halls of Congress and within the halls of the Capitol of Trump supporters who have breached those doors.
[02:16:55.895 --> 02:16:59.035]  Two Capitol Hill buildings have been evacuated by the U.S.C.P.
[02:16:59.035 --> 02:17:04.737]  and we're also hearing that the private residences on Capitol Hill are being evacuated as well.
[02:17:04.737 --> 02:17:13.519]  Senators, the Vice President, the Congressmen, now no doubt making their way towards the security of the underground tunnels to escort them away from the threat
[02:17:14.079 --> 02:17:22.645]  of their supposed constituents angry, furious, and now venting that frustration on the system that has betrayed them time and time again.
[02:17:22.645 --> 02:17:24.046]  This is just incredible, folks.
[02:17:24.046 --> 02:17:25.027]  You're watching InfoWars.
[02:17:25.027 --> 02:17:26.348]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:26.348 --> 02:17:29.070]  Alex Jones is right now at the scene.
[02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:30.191]  They're sort of on the edge.
[02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:38.617]  We're receiving intermittent streams from them as the cell phone networks are overloaded and information becomes harder to come by.
[02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:40.478]  What we know is that Alex Jones and Owen Schroer
[02:17:40.578 --> 02:17:42.780]  They are not at the head of this.
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:50.966]  They are not the ones breaking into the Capitol, but they are there on the periphery watching this, receiving this information in real time.
[02:17:50.966 --> 02:17:52.448]  Truly incredible.
[02:17:52.448 --> 02:18:01.795]  DC is now in control of the Patriots as an officer of the United States Capitol Police radios the phrase, we have lost control.
[02:18:01.795 --> 02:18:03.837]  I repeat, we have lost control.
[02:18:03.837 --> 02:18:07.199]  Protesters now inside the Capitol building, those marble staircases,
[02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:18.443]  Being trod upon by patriots who are raising their hands showing they are peaceful, yet they aren't going anywhere as one after another the security barriers have fallen.
[02:18:18.443 --> 02:18:21.424]  VP Mike Pence evacuated from the Capitol building.
[02:18:21.424 --> 02:18:23.305]  Trump loyalists storm U.S.
[02:18:23.305 --> 02:18:23.745]  Capitol.
[02:18:23.745 --> 02:18:24.945]  Tear gas deployed.
[02:18:24.945 --> 02:18:25.745]  Few arrests made.
[02:18:25.745 --> 02:18:26.886]  The police have lost control.
[02:18:26.886 --> 02:18:28.066]  Barricades torn down.
[02:18:28.066 --> 02:18:29.567]  Buildings evacuated.
[02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:34.048]  The press has been moved to the basement as they scramble to avoid the on-press
[02:18:34.608 --> 02:18:42.412]  Of millions, at least I would say my estimation, a million Trump supporters having moved from throughout D.C.
[02:18:42.412 --> 02:18:44.613]  and are now converging on the Capitol.
[02:18:44.613 --> 02:18:46.593]  This is revolution in progress.
[02:18:46.593 --> 02:18:50.515]  This is a major historic moment in the history of the United States.
[02:18:50.515 --> 02:18:56.418]  It is a privilege and an honor to be here sharing it with you and bringing you updates just as soon as possible.
[02:18:56.758 --> 02:18:59.299]  We're getting information that you will not get anywhere else.
[02:18:59.299 --> 02:19:08.682]  We are receiving videos and updates in a faster method than any other network, mainstream or otherwise.
[02:19:08.682 --> 02:19:14.423]  Here we see, okay, now we have a battalion of neon-shirted police.
[02:19:14.423 --> 02:19:16.004]  The backup has been called.
[02:19:16.004 --> 02:19:19.165]  They're moving slowly but surely towards the Capitol.
[02:19:19.525 --> 02:19:21.306]  But it may be already too late.
[02:19:21.306 --> 02:19:22.406]  The doors have been breached.
[02:19:22.406 --> 02:19:23.806]  The Patriots are inside.
[02:19:23.806 --> 02:19:29.628]  The Senate has ceased debating because the vote has been paused.
[02:19:29.628 --> 02:19:31.908]  The vote on certification has been paused.
[02:19:31.908 --> 02:19:35.429]  And the entire building is being evacuated, folks.
[02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:36.910]  We've seen it for four years.
[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:39.070]  We've seen the anger of the left.
[02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:45.192]  We saw it under Kavanaugh as the protesters who fell for the lie time after time again.
[02:19:45.612 --> 02:19:48.274]  Screech and claw impotently at the door.
[02:19:48.274 --> 02:19:54.418]  We've seen six months or more of violent protest burning down entire cities.
[02:19:54.418 --> 02:20:04.104]  Aimless, pointless destruction being wrought across the United States by liberal and communist agitators all to the point of trying to tear down our system.
[02:20:04.104 --> 02:20:07.606]  Now we see not the system fight back but those who love
[02:20:08.186 --> 02:20:09.587]  America, fight back.
[02:20:09.587 --> 02:20:19.857]  Patriots now taking over the entire Capitol steps, continuing to wave the American flag, the Gadsden flag, the Tree of Liberty flag, the Trump flag.
[02:20:19.857 --> 02:20:21.619]  They've taken it over.
[02:20:21.619 --> 02:20:22.420]  It is done.
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:24.802]  This is what happens when Americans rise up.
[02:20:24.802 --> 02:20:30.867]  This is what happens when patriots do what the communists have been trying to do for so long.
[02:20:32.368 --> 02:20:51.573]  Again, this is not an impotent, pointless, nonsense protest based off misinformation like the death of George Floyd, who killed himself with fentanyl, or Jacob Blake, who just yesterday was proven he was armed and dangerous when police rightfully took him down, or the lies of Brett Kavanaugh.
[02:20:51.573 --> 02:21:00.395]  For four years, we've seen the outrageous and yet impotent lashing out of leftists throughout America, and for the first time, it seems, after having
[02:21:01.115 --> 02:21:21.191]  Shown patience, that of angels, the Americans, the Trump supporters who've seen their lives destroyed, they've seen their businesses shut down, they've seen the lockdown perpetuated all across America, destroying our economy, surrendering to China over and over again, stories that expose the corruption and the
[02:21:21.972 --> 02:21:32.678]  Underselling of America to Communist China to other foreign powers have gone ignored, have been suppressed, have been shut down time and time again.
[02:21:32.678 --> 02:21:38.982]  The American people have shrugged and taken the blows on the back without so much as a whimper in protest.
[02:21:39.482 --> 02:21:42.383]  But finally, they have pushed too far.
[02:21:42.383 --> 02:21:57.468]  After stealing our last resort, we always knew in the back of our minds, in the back of our heads, we had the numbers, we had the will, we could, through the electoral process, maintain some semblance of control over what is supposed to be our representative democracy, our republic.
[02:21:58.268 --> 02:22:00.009]  Well, they stole that from us.
[02:22:00.009 --> 02:22:02.190]  They took away the final lifeline.
[02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:20.219]  They destroyed the final pressure valve, and now the rage of the American people overflows as patriots storm into the United States Capitol, waving Trump flags, waving American flags, waving the Gadsden flag, taking over the steps, pushing through the doors, and forcing an evacuation of our representatives.
[02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:21.399]  I think?
[02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:49.955]  Views sometimes even within the Capitol as it looks like the press moves away and retreats as more and more Trump supporters and patriots pour into the Capitol.
[02:22:49.955 --> 02:22:52.736]  We have a tweet from Donald Trump one minute ago.
[02:22:52.736 --> 02:23:04.400]  Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution, giving states a chance to certify a correct set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones they were asked to previously certify.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:04.980]  U.S.
[02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:06.381]  demands the truth.
[02:23:06.741 --> 02:23:08.462]  And here we have Alex Jones in front of the Capitol.
[02:23:08.462 --> 02:23:09.162]  Do we have audio on this?
[02:23:24.619 --> 02:23:26.759]  We've all said, we want to be peaceful.
[02:23:26.759 --> 02:23:35.021]  We don't like the left that shoots cops and burns down apartment buildings and fire departments and police stations and things.
[02:23:35.021 --> 02:23:36.602]  And run around terrorizing America.
[02:23:36.602 --> 02:23:39.682]  That's the left, that's anti-food, that's BLM.
[02:23:39.682 --> 02:23:41.002]  But Americans aren't mad.
[02:23:41.002 --> 02:23:42.803]  And so when they stage elections in Venezuela...
[02:23:50.375 --> 02:23:57.318]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[02:23:57.318 --> 02:24:03.561]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[02:24:03.561 --> 02:24:06.962]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[02:24:06.962 --> 02:24:12.124]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[02:24:12.124 --> 02:24:16.386]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[02:24:17.785 --> 02:24:27.391]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:24:27.391 --> 02:24:31.513]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[02:24:31.513 --> 02:24:37.997]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[02:24:37.997 --> 02:24:43.540]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:44.461]  So help me God.
[02:24:49.746 --> 02:24:58.536]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[02:24:58.536 --> 02:25:05.343]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in them.
[02:25:05.723 --> 02:25:06.943]  This does not have the fluoride.
[02:25:06.943 --> 02:25:08.344]  It doesn't have the additives.
[02:25:08.344 --> 02:25:09.564]  This is a concentrate.
[02:25:09.564 --> 02:25:11.025]  It really is high quality.
[02:25:11.025 --> 02:25:16.186]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[02:25:16.186 --> 02:25:17.967]  But now it's back in stock.
[02:25:17.967 --> 02:25:22.388]  Info Wars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.
[02:25:22.388 --> 02:25:27.870]  Now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-33139.
[02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:34.592]  It also makes a great gift for your family, for your grandkids, for your mother, your father, for everybody.
[02:25:34.872 --> 02:25:35.192]  Thank you.
[02:25:49.835 --> 02:25:54.080]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming.
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:57.683]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[02:25:57.683 --> 02:26:02.949]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[02:26:02.949 --> 02:26:09.296]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices, and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[02:26:09.756 --> 02:26:13.201]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[02:26:13.201 --> 02:26:15.483]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[02:26:15.483 --> 02:26:23.474]  The globalists are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[02:26:23.474 --> 02:26:27.619]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[02:26:27.939 --> 02:26:39.664]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at PrepareWithAlex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storable foods out there.
[02:26:39.664 --> 02:26:52.229]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at PrepareWithAlex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality storable food.
[02:26:52.229 --> 02:26:54.870]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:05.416 --> 02:27:07.518]  I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:11.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is being made as we speak.
[02:27:11.802 --> 02:27:15.626]  This just in, as of less than a minute ago, Rotunda door has now been breached.
[02:27:15.626 --> 02:27:19.049]  Capitol Police say Trump protesters surged into the building.
[02:27:19.049 --> 02:27:25.856]  That's according to Disclosed TV, who shows an overhead shot of this massive crowd moving towards the Capitol.
[02:27:25.856 --> 02:27:28.038]  We're seeing shots from inside.
[02:27:28.038 --> 02:27:30.360]  Now, the Trump protesters, here's shots from inside.
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:33.321]  Now, you can see the glass there and the wood door.
[02:27:33.321 --> 02:27:36.543]  I believe this is the eastern door of the Capitol.
[02:27:36.543 --> 02:27:41.325]  And you can see the protesters asking the people inside, hey, push the door open, push the door open.
[02:27:41.325 --> 02:27:57.132]  Not even attempting to break the glass, not attempting to cause trouble or to cause damage, but rather trying to get the people inside to act as patriots themselves, open the door, and put an end to this farce of an election that we've been witness to this entire time.
[02:27:57.132 --> 02:27:58.273]  Truly incredible stuff.
[02:28:00.835 --> 02:28:05.997]  Darren J. Beattie on Twitter says the FBI should take a knee to show respect to the MAGA protesters.
[02:28:05.997 --> 02:28:10.459]  Yeah, maybe if Black Lives Matter was there, the police would be on our side.
[02:28:10.459 --> 02:28:12.980]  Instead, the police have fallen back.
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:14.980]  The Senate chambers have been evacuated.
[02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:22.583]  The vote counting, the certification of the electors has been suspended for the time being as they deal with the fact that protesters are now within the Capitol.
[02:28:22.583 --> 02:28:27.325]  Here we're seeing physical combat taking place inside the Capitol.
[02:28:27.825 --> 02:28:28.045]  I think?
[02:28:43.737 --> 02:28:52.001]  Now, before the debate was ceased, McConnell had said the election was not stolen, as Trump says.
[02:28:52.001 --> 02:28:54.582]  McConnell claims there was no massive collection of fraud.
[02:28:54.582 --> 02:29:00.865]  McConnell says Congress can't make itself a board of elections.
[02:29:00.865 --> 02:29:01.806]  Amazing, isn't it?
[02:29:01.806 --> 02:29:12.851]  Absolutely amazing, the utter failure of the Republicans to wield any sort of institutional power at the behest of or to the benefit of their own
[02:29:14.332 --> 02:29:21.398]  People, the election fraud as enumerated earlier today by Donald Trump is in the millions.
[02:29:21.398 --> 02:29:38.253]  The provable ones is at least the hundreds of thousands, he pointed out, the hundreds of thousands of people in Detroit, in Georgia, in Michigan and Minnesota and elsewhere of non-registered voters, of registered voters who, you know, more votes than registered voters.
[02:29:38.253 --> 02:29:39.113]  In Detroit you had 139 percent.
[02:29:41.757 --> 02:29:51.448]  I mean, this doesn't make any sense, this is incredible, this is nonsense, and yet it goes unopposed by the Republicans with the power to do anything about it.
[02:29:51.448 --> 02:29:59.036]  They instead abrogate that power and refuse to exert their constitutional authority instead
[02:29:59.677 --> 02:30:21.832]  Wanting to do anything they can to simply get rid of President Trump so they can get back to the status quo back to business as usual which is of course the continual selling out of the American people the continual undermining of our heritage and our nation and the continual surrendering of Everything we hold dear to those who would destroy us and make no bones about it.
[02:30:21.832 --> 02:30:28.476]  This is from their own mouths We're seeing now on Fox News and elsewhere just the sheer crowds
[02:30:30.277 --> 02:30:36.199]  All over the Capitol steps, waving stop the steal signs, waving American flags.
[02:30:36.199 --> 02:30:39.441]  For the time being, at least, the steal has been stopped.
[02:30:39.441 --> 02:30:47.944]  We're no longer counting the votes, no longer debating the certification.
[02:30:47.944 --> 02:30:50.124]  It has all ground to a halt.
[02:30:50.124 --> 02:30:57.087]  It has all ceased to continue as the lawmakers and the other Capitol Hill staffers
[02:30:58.061 --> 02:30:59.523]  We're good to go.
[02:31:17.697 --> 02:31:23.485]  I say that in jest, obviously, but if you really think about it so far, nothing's been burnt down.
[02:31:23.485 --> 02:31:29.313]  No innocent people have been knocked out and then kicked in the head while they lay on the pavement.
[02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:32.196]  This has not scratched the surface of the type of violence, chaos,
[02:31:32.797 --> 02:31:42.065]  and destruction that we've seen rot across this entire nation for an entire year without the slightest hint of protest from the Democrats.
[02:31:42.065 --> 02:31:44.267]  In fact, they support them, they join them.
[02:31:44.267 --> 02:31:53.275]  Right now what we're seeing is not George Soros funded, this is not people trained by the Communist Chinese like Black Lives Matter leaders admit to being.
[02:31:53.275 --> 02:31:58.059]  This is a natural, spontaneous event being carried out by
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.540]  Trump supporters from all over the nation.
[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:18.324]  We also have incredible images of the Michigan Statehouse outside of which a massive wooden cross has been erected as a symbol of defiance to the satanic pedophile network that has slowly but surely captured each and every institution that governs this once great nation.
[02:32:18.324 --> 02:32:19.845]  Truly incredible stuff.
[02:32:19.845 --> 02:32:21.865]  Do we still have that feed from Alex Jones?
[02:32:24.085 --> 02:32:27.348]  Alex Jones and Ownershire are live on the scene.
[02:32:27.348 --> 02:32:38.540]  We're having trouble getting connected to them because of the overwhelming number of people has, as I said, overwhelmed the cellular networks.
[02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:44.987]  Absolutely massive scenes inside the Capitol building of protesters making their way up and down the marble staircases.
[02:32:46.158 --> 02:32:55.684]  As of four minutes ago, we see somebody videoing down the staircases, out the windows, as they see these patriots move towards them.
[02:32:55.684 --> 02:33:00.447]  They then turn and run to safety, as we said before.
[02:33:00.447 --> 02:33:08.192]  Although things have escalated since then, I don't believe that any of our representatives are actually themselves at risk of physical injury.
[02:33:08.192 --> 02:33:10.613]  There is enough planning and
[02:33:11.974 --> 02:33:26.747]  You know, things in place, preparations have been made to where those people can very rapidly evacuate and get out into the tunnels beneath the streets of Washington, D.C., where they can be secreted away, ferried away to safety.
[02:33:26.747 --> 02:33:33.092]  I don't have too much fear for this becoming bloody or violent unless, of course, the police start to
[02:33:34.753 --> 02:33:36.014]  Clash back and push back.
[02:33:36.014 --> 02:33:38.655]  Here we're seeing just incredible images folks.
[02:33:38.655 --> 02:33:41.056]  This is a day that will go down in history.
[02:33:41.056 --> 02:33:54.824]  We're seeing protesters there scaling the very walls of the Capitol, scaling the scaffolding that once was erected for the inauguration on January 20th.
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:59.684]  And yes, we're seeing images here that will go down in history.
[02:33:59.684 --> 02:34:02.167]  This is a major moment in America.
[02:34:02.167 --> 02:34:08.313]  Whether it will come to anything or not, I guess we'll have to just wait and see and we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them.
[02:34:09.284 --> 02:34:17.948]  Again, two of the Capitol buildings were evacuated earlier because of apparently the threat of a pipe bomb that has been withdrawn.
[02:34:17.948 --> 02:34:25.451]  Those buildings no longer have that stand-down order issued, or that evacuation order rather, issued.
[02:34:25.451 --> 02:34:34.655]  But it seems like the residential buildings around Capitol Hill are being evacuated and the Senate and Congress themselves have been evacuated and are no longer
[02:34:36.653 --> 02:34:39.896]  Taking part in the debate or the certification of votes.
[02:34:39.896 --> 02:34:44.419]  Here we see a protester holding a riot shield that he probably got from a police officer.
[02:34:44.419 --> 02:34:54.047]  Windows being broken and tentatively, here we go, the Patriots moving in towards, moving into the Capitol building.
[02:34:54.047 --> 02:34:57.409]  This is incredible, folks.
[02:34:57.409 --> 02:35:00.592]  There you go, using the riot shield to bash through the windows.
[02:35:03.166 --> 02:35:03.386]  Of course!
[02:35:28.111 --> 02:35:40.074]  Oh my god, now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire extinguishers and are spraying them at the people, the congressional staffers and members of the media who are attempting to film them.
[02:35:40.074 --> 02:35:45.515]  They're getting a face full of fire extinguisher gas as police continue to radio.
[02:35:45.515 --> 02:35:47.916]  And we heard over the radio from the U.S.
[02:35:47.916 --> 02:35:50.416]  Capitol Police, we have lost control.
[02:35:50.416 --> 02:35:52.437]  Repeat, we have lost control.
[02:35:53.137 --> 02:36:03.140]  Control now ceded to the Patriots who have breached the Capitol and are moving ever more, you know, ever farther into this Capitol building.
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:15.164]  People dressed as pioneers, people carrying riot shields that have been stripped from the Capitol City Police, MAGA hats, Confederate flags, American flags, Gadsden flags.
[02:36:16.977 --> 02:36:19.778]  Again, mostly peaceful, I have to say.
[02:36:19.778 --> 02:36:21.218]  I haven't seen any attacks.
[02:36:21.218 --> 02:36:25.699]  I haven't seen any vicious lashing out at innocent people.
[02:36:25.699 --> 02:36:39.603]  I've seen nothing but tearing down of barriers, the breaking of windows, and the moving ever forward inexorably towards the heart of the Republic, the Capitol building, which has long been under the occupation of globalist forces.
[02:36:39.603 --> 02:36:45.205]  This is truly incredible stuff, folks, and we'll bring you up-to-date updates as we get there.
[02:36:45.205 --> 02:36:45.685]  Stay with us.
[02:36:49.045 --> 02:36:50.726]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:36:50.726 --> 02:36:52.127]  Thank you for holding.
[02:36:52.127 --> 02:36:53.628]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:36:53.628 --> 02:36:55.049]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:36:55.049 --> 02:36:56.290]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:36:56.290 --> 02:36:57.011]  How are you?
[02:36:57.011 --> 02:36:57.791]  I love you, man.
[02:36:57.791 --> 02:37:00.113]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:37:00.113 --> 02:37:01.994]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:37:01.994 --> 02:37:18.446]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:37:19.105 --> 02:37:24.529]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:37:24.529 --> 02:37:38.020]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:42.744]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:37:42.744 --> 02:37:44.185]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:37:48.792 --> 02:38:02.795]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government-corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which, of course, the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[02:38:02.795 --> 02:38:04.795]  It's all now completely official.
[02:38:04.795 --> 02:38:08.676]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Demos Group.
[02:38:08.676 --> 02:38:15.178]  And Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[02:38:15.178 --> 02:38:16.138]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[02:38:17.498 --> 02:38:24.681]  It only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[02:38:24.681 --> 02:38:31.024]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[02:38:31.024 --> 02:38:33.204]  We must start valuing human life again.
[02:38:33.204 --> 02:38:40.087]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[02:38:40.087 --> 02:38:42.848]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[02:38:42.848 --> 02:38:46.270]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[02:38:49.836 --> 02:38:53.019]  It's back in stock.
[02:38:53.019 --> 02:38:54.500]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:57.603]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[02:38:57.603 --> 02:38:58.904]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[02:38:58.904 --> 02:39:03.007]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[02:39:03.007 --> 02:39:09.012]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[02:39:09.012 --> 02:39:10.153]  It's amazing.
[02:39:10.153 --> 02:39:11.614]  Folks absolutely love it.
[02:39:11.614 --> 02:39:14.556]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[02:39:14.556 --> 02:39:16.278]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[02:39:16.878 --> 02:39:19.362]  25% off at m4workstore.com.
[02:39:19.362 --> 02:39:23.127]  Pollen Block, again, is available in this one-minute ad.
[02:39:23.127 --> 02:39:32.840]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable.
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:33.680]  I think so.
[02:39:50.299 --> 02:39:51.399]  The Great Reset is here.
[02:39:51.399 --> 02:40:05.183]  The world government has openly been announced, and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family, and to make you so poor, you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income, forced inoculations, and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist, globalist system.
[02:40:05.183 --> 02:40:17.767]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active, and get prepared for self-defense, and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need, so you're not dependent on the system.
[02:40:17.947 --> 02:40:20.828]  We have the best storable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[02:40:20.828 --> 02:40:23.369]  All the other big competitors have already gone up on their prices.
[02:40:23.369 --> 02:40:27.291]  But our supplier has high quality food in stock ready to ship to you.
[02:40:27.291 --> 02:40:30.092]  And by January 8th, they're going to have to raise prices some.
[02:40:30.092 --> 02:40:31.212]  So take advantage now.
[02:40:31.212 --> 02:40:32.853]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:40:32.853 --> 02:40:38.515]  And on top of that, you can save up to $850 off their regular rates.

[02:40:40.636 --> 02:40:42.317]  You've got until January 8th.
[02:40:42.317 --> 02:40:47.559]  And the profit that comes in then helps fund the InfoWar, fighting for America, fighting for justice, fighting for freedom.
[02:40:47.859 --> 02:40:53.269]  A true 360 win.
[02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:55.873]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:10.128]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've just received reports of shooting going on.
[02:41:10.128 --> 02:41:11.430]  This is absolutely incredible, folks.
[02:41:11.430 --> 02:41:16.557]  The revolution will be televised exclusively on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:16.557 --> 02:41:20.002]  Elijah Schaefer is now inside Nancy Pelosi's office.
[02:41:21.265 --> 02:41:21.786]  We bring that up.
[02:41:21.786 --> 02:41:23.587]  They're shooting into the chamber.
[02:41:23.587 --> 02:41:30.853]  Elijah Schaefer says, I'm inside Nancy Pelosi's office with thousands of revolutionaries who stormed the building to put into perspective how quickly staff evacuated.
[02:41:30.853 --> 02:41:36.258]  Emails are still on the screen alongside a federal alert warning members of the current revolution.
[02:41:36.258 --> 02:41:39.340]  There Elijah Schaefer inside Nancy Pelosi's office.
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:45.905]  We also are hearing reports that shots are being fired within the dome of the Capitol.
[02:41:45.905 --> 02:41:47.227]  Tear gas is being fired.
[02:41:48.307 --> 02:41:54.910]  We have from CNN supporters of President Trump breached the US Capitol according to Capitol Police officers.
[02:41:54.910 --> 02:41:58.452]  Yes, that is happening CNN believe it or not.
[02:41:58.452 --> 02:42:01.093]  We don't need to hear from the Capitol Police when we see it with our own eyes.
[02:42:01.093 --> 02:42:05.895]  Trump supporters chase away the outnumbered Capitol Police and throw objects at them.
[02:42:05.895 --> 02:42:11.397]  We're seeing there inside the Capitol and outside patriots swarming throughout.
[02:42:11.397 --> 02:42:13.058]  We're going to try to find
[02:42:14.724 --> 02:42:17.866]  Try to find more information about this shooting that has been reported.
[02:42:17.866 --> 02:42:25.889]  We don't know whether this is bullets being fired or whether this is tear gas canisters perhaps being fired.
[02:42:25.889 --> 02:42:31.172]  Ted Cruz says violence is always unacceptable even when passions run high.
[02:42:31.172 --> 02:42:37.535]  Here we have Ido Keefe reports that a congressional aide says members were told to get under the chairs in the House chamber.
[02:42:37.535 --> 02:42:41.457]  Here we see, my god, we see members inside the Senate chambers
[02:42:42.017 --> 02:42:49.461]  Piling up furniture to block the doors as protesters move ever towards the center of our republic.
[02:42:49.461 --> 02:42:51.903]  This is absolutely mind-blowing.
[02:42:51.903 --> 02:43:03.730]  They say they're shooting into the chamber, so perhaps, and that goes along with the image that you're seeing here, so perhaps they are, the members have piled furniture to block the doors
[02:43:05.083 --> 02:43:10.728]  Trump supporters outnumbering the Capitol Police and driving them away, throwing objects at them.
[02:43:10.728 --> 02:43:15.552]  Trump supporters scaling the walls of the Capitol, breaking into the Capitol.
[02:43:15.552 --> 02:43:28.764]  They've secured fire extinguishers and are blowing them in the face of the Capitol Hill staff there that's attempting to video or film what's going on.
[02:43:28.764 --> 02:43:31.327]  This is incredible, folks.
[02:43:32.535 --> 02:43:34.559]  Okay, we already saw that.
[02:43:34.559 --> 02:43:37.244]  I want to hear more about this supposed shooting.
[02:43:39.155 --> 02:43:42.337]  From Disclosed TV, protesters are smashing the doors to the U.S.
[02:43:42.337 --> 02:43:43.018]  House chamber.
[02:43:43.018 --> 02:43:53.384]  That's the image that we saw just a second ago of the furniture being piled up in an attempt to prevent or at least waylay or delay the breaking into the House chamber there.
[02:43:53.384 --> 02:43:53.565]  U.S.
[02:43:53.565 --> 02:43:57.827]  Senate chamber has been evacuated and senators are being taken to a secure location.
[02:43:57.827 --> 02:44:02.831]  House members are being instructed to put on masks as tear gas is now inside the U.S.
[02:44:02.831 --> 02:44:03.851]  Capitol Dome, folks.
[02:44:03.851 --> 02:44:05.813]  This is, again, unprecedented.
[02:44:05.813 --> 02:44:08.555]  This is history being made as we speak.
[02:44:09.335 --> 02:44:14.439]  Uh, via MEP Fuller, shots fired into the U.S.
[02:44:14.439 --> 02:44:15.560]  House Chamber.
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:21.905]  We don't know if that is an armed protester, or if those are, uh, officers firing, or if that's tear gas.
[02:44:21.905 --> 02:44:24.227]  All we've heard is that shots are being fired into the U.S.
[02:44:24.227 --> 02:44:32.834]  House Chamber, as protesters are smashing the door to that House Chamber, and the representatives are piling furniture up to block that door.
[02:44:35.787 --> 02:44:39.729]  Again, Elijah Schaefer inside Nancy Pelosi's office.
[02:44:39.729 --> 02:44:51.354]  They didn't even have time to sign out of their computers, leaving the, no doubt, should-be-secured programs wide open for anybody and everybody to see.
[02:44:51.354 --> 02:44:55.376]  Okay, it looks like those are police on either side of the door with guns.
[02:44:55.376 --> 02:44:58.898]  So, as the protesters are attempting to break down the door, shots are being fired.
[02:44:58.898 --> 02:45:01.679]  We don't know if they're being fired into.
[02:45:02.884 --> 02:45:17.111]  The cap into the chamber there but we definitely see at least three guns being leveled from inside the chamber to the door you know at the door firing at the protesters outside of that door.
[02:45:17.111 --> 02:45:21.753]  Folks this is this is history being made as we speak.
[02:45:21.753 --> 02:45:26.436]  Where this goes from here it is anybody's guess but it doesn't look like it will be calming down or
[02:45:28.375 --> 02:45:29.677]  Ending anytime soon.
[02:45:29.677 --> 02:45:35.184]  We're receiving updates from a variety of sources here.
[02:45:35.184 --> 02:45:36.225]  As we continue to.
[02:45:36.225 --> 02:45:40.130]  To monitor what is going on.
[02:45:42.409 --> 02:45:46.050]  My God folks, let's keep rolling some of these videos.
[02:45:46.050 --> 02:45:48.531]  Trump supporters again chasing away the Capitol Police.
[02:45:48.531 --> 02:45:51.812]  The Capitol Police saying we've lost control.
[02:45:51.812 --> 02:45:58.315]  Hordes of Trump supporters now posted up on the front steps of the Capitol and you can see outside the Capitol
[02:45:58.775 --> 02:46:10.850]  Hundreds of thousands of more Trump supporters moving ever towards this building, this symbol of our once great country that has been occupied by globalist forces for at least as long as I have been alive.
[02:46:10.850 --> 02:46:16.858]  And it seems like the patience of the American people and the patriots who have tried time and time and time again to
[02:46:18.615 --> 02:46:18.895]  We're good.
[02:46:38.942 --> 02:46:46.868]  Powerful head as we are watching live these various flags, the Betsy Ross flag, the Episcopalian flag.
[02:46:46.868 --> 02:46:50.651]  Would you guys mind throwing up that warning back on the screen once again?
[02:46:50.651 --> 02:47:00.579]  We had a warning from the mayor of DC, Mario Bowser, who I believe has issued a curfew, has issued an emergency shutdown.
[02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:04.383]  Here it is, Mayor Bowser issues city-wide curfew for D.C.
[02:47:04.383 --> 02:47:06.424]  for Wednesday, January 6th, starting at 6 p.m.
[02:47:06.424 --> 02:47:08.986]  until Thursday, January 7th at 6 a.m.
[02:47:08.986 --> 02:47:12.729]  Essential workers, including healthcare personnel and media, are exempt.
[02:47:12.729 --> 02:47:14.151]  Good luck enforcing that.
[02:47:14.151 --> 02:47:23.658]  I don't remember such a curfew being issued for Black Lives Matter or Antifa when they were running around burning down historic churches, attacking innocent people, assaulting police officers.
[02:47:23.658 --> 02:47:29.723]  Here we see Trump supporters not engaged in meaningless, pointless, impotent violence, but rather
[02:47:30.632 --> 02:47:35.515]  Simply pushing past the police and into the Capitol building to make themselves known.
[02:47:35.515 --> 02:47:38.417]  Trump supporters chase way outnumbered Capitol police and throw objects at them.
[02:47:38.417 --> 02:47:40.538]  This is Julio Rosas.
[02:47:40.538 --> 02:47:45.962]  But again, here you see Trump supporters actually putting their bodies in front of the police and just saying, hey, just keep backing up.
[02:47:45.962 --> 02:47:46.882]  We're not going to attack you.
[02:47:46.882 --> 02:47:48.003]  We're not going to hurt you.
[02:47:48.003 --> 02:47:48.843]  You are not our enemy.
[02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:55.605]  Yeah, you don't see this type of behavior from the leftists when they get going.
[02:47:55.605 --> 02:47:57.887]  You see a lot of attacks of innocent people.
[02:47:57.887 --> 02:47:59.889]  You see a lot of burning things down.
[02:47:59.889 --> 02:48:04.112]  You see destruction of valuable, sometimes irreplaceable property.
[02:48:04.112 --> 02:48:05.734]  I've seen no statues torn down here.
[02:48:05.734 --> 02:48:07.175]  I've seen no egregious violence.
[02:48:07.175 --> 02:48:13.741]  I've seen no violence really at all except for the occasional punch thrown or mace can being sprayed.
[02:48:15.242 --> 02:48:19.144]  But we see which is more effective here.
[02:48:19.144 --> 02:48:33.591]  Guns drawn as we see at least three capital city security officers level their pistols over the furniture that's been piled in the congressional chamber.
[02:48:33.591 --> 02:48:33.972]  What is it?
[02:48:33.972 --> 02:48:37.774]  Okay, this is a protester now standing in the speaker's position.
[02:48:37.774 --> 02:48:40.155]  I believe that's in the Senate.
[02:48:41.257 --> 02:48:46.059]  I believe that's the Senate building, if I'm not mistaken, or the Senate chamber rather.
[02:48:46.059 --> 02:49:07.966]  We see protesters, reports of shots fired on Capitol Hill as more and more police rush from throughout the capital city to the Capitol building in an attempt to mitigate or somehow prevent or do something to stand up against the onrush of Trump loyalists, patriots, and America firsters as we
[02:49:08.886 --> 02:49:18.320]  Move towards the Capitol Building, into the Capitol Building, and then into the Senate and Congressional Chamber.
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.502]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:49:19.502 --> 02:49:23.948]  Mayor Bowser issuing a citywide curfew that I, if I had to guess,
[02:49:25.404 --> 02:49:26.405]  We're good to go.
[02:49:44.139 --> 02:49:46.901]  On the side of our country, stay peaceful.
[02:49:46.901 --> 02:49:48.682]  That's the word from President Trump.
[02:49:48.682 --> 02:49:50.904]  Support our Capitol Police and law enforcement.
[02:49:50.904 --> 02:49:52.545]  Stay peaceful.
[02:49:52.545 --> 02:49:55.087]  That ship may have sailed, Mr. President.
[02:49:55.087 --> 02:50:01.491]  Armed standoff reported inside the Capitol building as of three minutes ago, according to Matthew Keyes.
[02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:05.494]  Trump supporters have gotten through the doors, apparently, into the House chamber.
[02:50:05.494 --> 02:50:11.218]  A pool reporter in the House chamber reports there's an armed standoff at the front of the, at the House front door.
[02:50:12.199 --> 02:50:13.740]  There's an armed standoff at the house.
[02:50:13.740 --> 02:50:14.521]  Front the door.
[02:50:14.521 --> 02:50:19.365]  Police officers have their guns drawn at somebody who's trying to breach the front door.
[02:50:19.365 --> 02:50:22.308]  DC phone warning just went off.
[02:50:22.308 --> 02:50:23.249]  They're in the chamber.
[02:50:23.249 --> 02:50:25.871]  One is up on the dais yelling, Trump won the election.
[02:50:25.871 --> 02:50:27.273]  This is insane.
[02:50:27.273 --> 02:50:33.398]  Elijah Schaefer is within Nancy Pelosi's office with the unsecured computers open.
[02:50:33.398 --> 02:50:37.542]  Ilhan Omar says she's safe but heartbroken about what we're enduring at the Capitol.
[02:50:38.223 --> 02:50:47.373]  This from somebody who continuously showed support and encouragement for the riots that ravaged our country for months and months.
[02:50:47.373 --> 02:50:50.197]  A different story when it's on her front yard.
[02:50:50.197 --> 02:50:52.419]  That's hypocrisy if I've ever seen it.
[02:50:52.419 --> 02:50:53.841]  Here we're seeing actually video.
[02:50:54.967 --> 02:50:55.368]  of course.
[02:51:13.271 --> 02:51:21.457]  The security of the Capitol building has been utterly devastated and decimated, and the rioters... Well, yeah, I guess we'll call them rioters.
[02:51:21.457 --> 02:51:22.798]  Why the hell not, right?
[02:51:22.798 --> 02:51:29.843]  The rioters, the protesters, the patriots, the Americans, the Trump supporters, the revolutionaries have taken the Capitol.
[02:51:29.843 --> 02:51:30.223]  The U.S.
[02:51:30.223 --> 02:51:32.705]  Capitol has fallen to the American people.
[02:51:32.705 --> 02:51:37.389]  This day will go down in history, ladies and gentlemen, and you're getting it all live here at AprilWars.com.
[02:51:38.769 --> 02:51:41.150]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:43.910]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:45.171]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[02:51:45.171 --> 02:51:52.693]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[02:51:52.693 --> 02:51:56.334]  I said man, I gotta get on that show and give him an update.
[02:51:56.334 --> 02:51:56.774]  I said if I
[02:51:56.914 --> 02:52:05.001]  If I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[02:52:05.001 --> 02:52:10.746]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this Info Wars store products.
[02:52:10.746 --> 02:52:17.271]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night, so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[02:52:17.271 --> 02:52:20.614]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right?
[02:52:21.034 --> 02:52:24.016]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense.
[02:52:24.016 --> 02:52:27.217]  Now you gotta follow that up with the Micro-VX.
[02:52:27.217 --> 02:52:28.258]  I learned that.
[02:52:28.258 --> 02:52:30.839]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[02:52:30.839 --> 02:52:31.499]  We didn't know.
[02:52:31.499 --> 02:52:32.660]  We didn't screen your call.
[02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:33.440]  We had no idea.
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:37.182]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[02:52:37.182 --> 02:52:37.823]  Living Defense.
[02:52:37.823 --> 02:52:38.383]  Living Defense.
[02:52:40.486 --> 02:52:51.134]  It's not a secret why in leftist-controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tent cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[02:52:51.134 --> 02:52:58.900]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:01.281]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[02:53:01.281 --> 02:53:04.024]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[02:53:04.024 --> 02:53:06.746]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[02:53:07.506 --> 02:53:09.267]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[02:53:09.267 --> 02:53:11.408]  They have huge private estates.
[02:53:11.408 --> 02:53:12.989]  They are separate from us.
[02:53:12.989 --> 02:53:14.849]  Their children go to private tutors.
[02:53:14.849 --> 02:53:16.170]  They admit this.
[02:53:16.170 --> 02:53:24.194]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[02:53:24.634 --> 02:53:30.157]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[02:53:30.157 --> 02:53:31.898]  This is all their admitted plan.
[02:53:31.898 --> 02:53:36.340]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational.
[02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:37.801]  It's a post-human future.
[02:53:37.801 --> 02:53:42.864]  You better find out about it right now.
[02:53:42.864 --> 02:53:45.565]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:54.878 --> 02:53:57.761]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a day that will go down in history.
[02:53:57.761 --> 02:53:59.303]  The Capitol has been stormed.
[02:53:59.303 --> 02:54:04.147]  The Capitol has fallen to the forces of the Trump-supporting patriots.
[02:54:04.147 --> 02:54:09.673]  Videos from inside the House chamber tell us of shots being fired.
[02:54:09.673 --> 02:54:15.278]  Newly elected House Representative Lauren Boebert says we are locked in the House chambers.
[02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:16.520]  The Speaker has been removed.
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:22.142]  We have on the line now Owen Schroer who is live on the scene in Washington, D.C.
[02:54:22.142 --> 02:54:23.642]  Owen, what is going on there?
[02:54:23.642 --> 02:54:26.023]  Do you have any information for us?
[02:54:26.023 --> 02:54:26.383]  Sure.
[02:54:26.383 --> 02:54:38.307]  In fact, we're probably going to have to be going back and forth with whatever intel we have because obviously out in the streets, you know, we're just getting whatever we can out here and I've just been pulled off the streets for the first time since about 8 a.m.
[02:54:38.307 --> 02:54:38.567]  this morning.
[02:54:38.567 --> 02:54:46.210]  Speaking of, Owen, I just got this information, not confirmed, but we have reports of a woman shot in the arm attempting to breach
[02:54:46.630 --> 02:54:47.230]  The chamber.
[02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:50.192]  So we have guns drawn inside the chamber.
[02:54:50.192 --> 02:54:52.034]  Furniture piled against the door.
[02:54:52.034 --> 02:54:57.798]  The security is firing out through the door and has apparently shot a woman in the arm.
[02:54:57.798 --> 02:55:00.039]  We have at least one gunshot wound.
[02:55:00.039 --> 02:55:03.401]  The Pentagon has denied the request to deploy the National Guard to the U.S.
[02:55:03.401 --> 02:55:04.122]  Capitol.
[02:55:04.122 --> 02:55:07.904]  That's of literally two seconds ago from Aurora Intel.
[02:55:07.904 --> 02:55:11.767]  And we're also receiving reports that the Georgia Capitol has been stormed as well.
[02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:12.888]  The state capitol in Georgia.
[02:55:13.408 --> 02:55:14.689]  No, I'm glad you broke in with us.
[02:55:14.689 --> 02:55:16.351]  In fact, we've been at the Capitol.
[02:55:16.351 --> 02:55:18.713]  We were there for about the last hour, maybe hour and a half.
[02:55:18.713 --> 02:55:19.874]  It's tough to say for sure.
[02:55:36.901 --> 02:56:03.034]  Um, but we, now the Capitol, we're trying to get a set up here so we can get on air with you guys on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a, on a
[02:56:03.331 --> 02:56:08.098]  Alright, that's Owen Schroyer there on the scene in Washington, D.C.
[02:56:08.098 --> 02:56:09.920]  attempting to get a secure line.
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:12.003]  We can actually hear from them uninterrupted.
[02:56:12.003 --> 02:56:18.613]  Again, the sheer number of people is overwhelming the cell systems and we're having difficulty even getting in contact.
[02:56:19.073 --> 02:56:25.158]  Uh, with people there, but they're getting set up and will soon be able to give us live updates of what it's like on the street.
[02:56:25.158 --> 02:56:30.202]  But again, we actually have a better view from then because we're not relying on just what we can see and hear.
[02:56:30.202 --> 02:56:34.205]  We're actually getting it from a thousand different directions at once.
[02:56:34.205 --> 02:56:38.048]  I repeat, the Defense Department has just denied a request by D.C.
[02:56:38.048 --> 02:56:40.670]  officials to deploy the National Guard to the U.S.
[02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:41.290]  Capitol.
[02:56:41.290 --> 02:56:43.512]  They have denied that request.
[02:56:43.512 --> 02:56:45.734]  Uh, this is, oh my God, this is amazing!
[02:56:45.734 --> 02:56:46.835]  Alright, so now we're seeing video.
[02:56:47.475 --> 02:56:47.815]  Of course.
[02:57:03.849 --> 02:57:13.657]  From a protester, a female protester has been shot by the Capitol security presumably who is inside the house chamber there.
[02:57:13.657 --> 02:57:15.538]  Furniture piled up against the door.
[02:57:15.538 --> 02:57:17.179]  There were protesters trying to get through that door.
[02:57:17.179 --> 02:57:22.263]  Shots were fired through the window of that door and seemingly struck a protester.
[02:57:22.263 --> 02:57:30.409]  These are the unconfirmed reports that we are receiving from less than a minute ago and we'll continue to bring you updates as we get them folks.
[02:57:30.409 --> 02:57:32.031]  This is the revolution
[02:57:32.851 --> 02:57:36.513]  And it's only going to be televised on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:36.513 --> 02:57:47.438]  I'm receiving updates from all sorts of InfoWarriors through Twitter, and we're also simply grabbing whatever we can from everybody who's there, including Elijah Schaffer, Julio Rosas.
[02:57:47.438 --> 02:57:52.501]  Now we see heavily armed with assault rifles, military-style rifles, body armor.
[02:57:52.501 --> 02:57:57.203]  This is the Capitol Police seemingly moving in towards the protesters.
[02:57:57.203 --> 02:58:00.925]  I don't know if we can expect more violence or if things will
[02:58:01.365 --> 02:58:01.605]  Perhaps
[02:58:31.305 --> 02:58:32.085]  We're good to go.
[02:58:49.133 --> 02:58:55.979]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in floors are no longer available.
[02:58:55.979 --> 02:59:03.826]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[02:59:03.826 --> 02:59:05.467]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[02:59:05.467 --> 02:59:11.673]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[02:59:11.673 --> 02:59:16.137]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[02:59:16.477 --> 02:59:21.621]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[02:59:21.621 --> 02:59:24.542]  And, by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months.
[02:59:24.542 --> 02:59:25.983]  It's now back in stock as well.
[02:59:25.983 --> 02:59:27.985]  They're great products and it funds the InfoWare.
[02:59:27.985 --> 02:59:32.688]  So get your Pollen Block and get your Activated Charcoal Toothpaste at InfoWareStore.com today.
[02:59:32.688 --> 02:59:36.370]  Again, our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste doesn't have additives.
[02:59:36.370 --> 02:59:37.411]  It's concentrated.
[02:59:37.411 --> 02:59:38.392]  People love it.
[02:59:38.392 --> 02:59:39.072]  It's amazing.
[02:59:39.072 --> 02:59:40.633]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[02:59:40.633 --> 02:59:42.434]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[02:59:42.434 --> 02:59:44.336]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:46.357 --> 02:59:46.706]  We're good.
[03:00:00.572 --> 03:00:02.613]  Shots fired, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:02.613 --> 03:00:07.196]  A request for the National Guard by Nancy Pelosi has been denied by the Pentagon.
[03:00:07.196 --> 03:00:11.779]  Protestors continue to breach various entry points of the U.S.
[03:00:11.779 --> 03:00:18.864]  Capitol, now using a window-washing platform to raise themselves up to the second level and attempt to break through windows there.
[03:00:18.864 --> 03:00:21.886]  This is absolutely unprecedented.
[03:00:22.546 --> 03:00:22.846]  Go ahead.
[03:00:41.058 --> 03:00:43.539]  Capital City Police here.
[03:00:43.539 --> 03:00:46.941]  You can see being, you know, laying down on the ground these protesters.
[03:00:46.941 --> 03:00:48.342]  It's peaceful protest, folks.
[03:00:48.342 --> 03:00:49.642]  Mostly peaceful.
[03:00:49.642 --> 03:00:51.023]  Trump supporters are just an idea.
[03:00:51.023 --> 03:00:52.824]  I think you're aware of that.
[03:00:52.824 --> 03:00:59.027]  The Senate is expected to go back into session in an alternative session shortly, according to C-SPAN.
[03:00:59.027 --> 03:01:01.428]  That's the update by Ian Miles Chong.
[03:01:01.428 --> 03:01:03.629]  I believe we have Owen Shorter back on the line.
[03:01:03.629 --> 03:01:07.151]  We had, we got cut off there earlier, but I think he can hear me.
[03:01:07.151 --> 03:01:07.651]  Owen, are you there?
[03:01:08.717 --> 03:01:09.297]  Oh, he's gone again.
[03:01:09.297 --> 03:01:17.479]  Okay, yeah, so the cellular networks are in constant flux here as we continue to try to get reports from the ground.
[03:01:17.479 --> 03:01:26.501]  The videos that are being uploaded are coming intermittently and we're bringing those to you just the minute that we get them, the second that we get them in many cases.
[03:01:26.501 --> 03:01:31.342]  Trump has tweeted out his disappointment in Pence.
[03:01:33.502 --> 03:01:44.370]  Posting these videos of the protesters absolutely surrounding and slamming, okay, a bloody woman on a stretcher right now on MSNBC.
[03:01:44.370 --> 03:01:48.633]  That was three minutes ago by Maria Hinojosa.
[03:01:48.633 --> 03:01:50.895]  OMG, bloody woman on a stretcher right now.
[03:01:50.895 --> 03:01:52.896]  So that must have been the woman who was shot.
[03:01:52.896 --> 03:01:56.819]  The tweet from President Trump, please support our Capitol Police and law enforcement.
[03:01:56.819 --> 03:01:59.461]  Here we're seeing video from once again inside the Senate chamber.
[03:01:59.461 --> 03:02:00.342]  You can see the
[03:02:00.982 --> 03:02:21.823]  Members of the Congress crouching behind walls, hiding as gunshots ring out, although what has been reported so far is the only shots that have been fired are from the Capitol City Police out through the door of this chamber at the protesters who are attempting to get in.
[03:02:21.823 --> 03:02:23.805]  Here we see the bloody stretcher and a woman
[03:02:24.948 --> 03:02:26.810]  Oh my gosh.
[03:02:26.810 --> 03:02:28.051]  Putting pressure on a wound.
[03:02:28.051 --> 03:02:30.592]  It looked like, we heard reports she was shot in the arm.
[03:02:30.592 --> 03:02:39.358]  That looked like she was shot in the chest, perhaps the collarbone, but absolutely covered in blood as she's rushed away from the Capitol.
[03:02:39.358 --> 03:02:44.022]  This may be the first casualty of the second American Revolution.
[03:02:44.022 --> 03:02:46.764]  This woman who is presumably, oh my god, and they're pumping her
[03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:49.717]  Wow, they're pumping her chest.
[03:02:49.717 --> 03:02:52.698]  That means she was most likely unresponsive.
[03:02:52.698 --> 03:02:58.440]  That woman may have died or at least sustained a critical energy.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:00.180]  Owen's on the line now.
[03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:01.101]  Owen, you're there.
[03:03:01.101 --> 03:03:06.042]  We're seeing images, live images of protesters inside the Congressional Chamber.
[03:03:06.042 --> 03:03:11.624]  We just saw a very disturbing video of a young woman being wheeled away, blood all over her chest.
[03:03:11.624 --> 03:03:15.705]  Her chest being palpitated by the first responders there.
[03:03:15.705 --> 03:03:16.906]  It did not look good for her.
[03:03:17.546 --> 03:03:20.487]  Uh, you're on the air now, Owen.
[03:03:20.487 --> 03:03:24.987]  So, uh, we've gotten to a location now where I should be able to talk without getting interrupted.
[03:03:24.987 --> 03:03:31.749]  Um, let me just walk through my day real quick, and we can kind of give you an update, uh, or we can go back and forth with the latest update.
[03:03:31.749 --> 03:03:32.949]  I'm on air right now.
[03:03:32.949 --> 03:03:35.709]  So, basically, okay.
[03:03:35.709 --> 03:03:36.589]  ...historic.
[03:03:36.589 --> 03:03:38.030]  The city is going under martial law.
[03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:39.570]  We caught Antony for provocateurs.
[03:03:39.570 --> 03:03:44.571]  We witnessed this on the footage at first start of the storming, but then triggered all this.
[03:03:44.571 --> 03:03:44.731]  So,
[03:03:45.430 --> 03:03:48.452]  So, Alex is going to be breaking that down momentarily.
[03:03:48.452 --> 03:03:51.395]  We got to the Trump rally today about 8 a.m.
[03:03:51.395 --> 03:03:54.697]  There were probably about half a million people there that we could see.
[03:03:54.697 --> 03:03:58.140]  The entire Washington Monument was filled.
[03:03:58.140 --> 03:03:59.761]  I mean, unlike anything we've ever seen.
[03:03:59.761 --> 03:04:01.863]  Half a million, I would say, conservatively.
[03:04:01.863 --> 03:04:04.825]  Trump spoke, the whole crowd was there until about 2 p.m.
[03:04:04.825 --> 03:04:09.309]  We then marched to the Capitol, where it looks like maybe half the crowd has gathered.
[03:04:09.309 --> 03:04:11.771]  At least 100,000 people here have surrounded the Capitol.
[03:04:11.771 --> 03:04:12.011]  More than 100,000?
[03:04:14.553 --> 03:04:21.280]  Cut all ads on the war room and go commercial free as soon as they can.
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:22.862]  Commercial free on all shows.
[03:04:22.862 --> 03:04:23.843]  Commercial free.
[03:04:23.843 --> 03:04:25.365]  I'm telling you folks, this is historic.
[03:04:25.365 --> 03:04:27.467]  They declared basically martial law.
[03:04:27.467 --> 03:04:29.009]  They're sending in a National Guard.
[03:04:29.009 --> 03:04:30.570]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:04:30.570 --> 03:04:31.712]  All because Antifab.
[03:04:31.712 --> 03:04:34.555]  The minute Trump announced he was going to come speak, Antifab
[03:04:35.729 --> 03:04:39.872]  And right now, I mean, again, we're on one side of the Capitol, so we can't see both sides.
[03:04:39.872 --> 03:04:41.894]  But on this side alone, there's probably about 100,000 people.
[03:04:41.894 --> 03:04:42.775]  They've taken the Capitol grounds.
[03:04:42.775 --> 03:04:44.136]  They've surrounded the building itself.
[03:04:44.136 --> 03:04:46.277]  They're on the actual building structure.
[03:05:01.477 --> 03:05:03.257]  Also, as you know, that they've gotten in.
[03:05:03.257 --> 03:05:13.440]  So this is all developing right now, but at least a million people in D.C., many of which are surrounding the Capitol, many of which are just still roaming the streets.
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:17.041]  And it's going to be interesting to see what happens tonight at 6 p.m.
[03:05:17.041 --> 03:05:18.001]  But I mean, this is crazy.
[03:05:18.001 --> 03:05:19.801]  I mean, we literally own these streets right now.
[03:05:19.801 --> 03:05:28.623]  There is not a block within the White House or the Capitol or the Supreme Court or anything where there's not at least 10,000, 100,000, a quarter million Trump supporters.
[03:05:31.284 --> 03:05:36.569]  And so, you know, it's so tough to really put this into perspective, because here's the deal.
[03:05:36.569 --> 03:05:40.853]  We're not violent revolutionaries, but they've taken our country.
[03:05:40.853 --> 03:05:46.037]  Our country is occupied, and you can debate all day long what the appropriate response is.
[03:05:46.037 --> 03:05:55.126]  The point is, we finally have a response, and we haven't had any fight in our Congress, we haven't had any fight in our legislatures, and so this is what's going to happen, is we the people are going to have to fight.
[03:05:55.126 --> 03:05:57.488]  Again, we did not come here as violent revolutionaries.
[03:05:58.408 --> 03:06:00.930]  But the history is definitely being made right now.
[03:06:00.930 --> 03:06:11.537]  I don't know if today is the turning point that will change the course of American history, or if this is just the nexus of the beginning of we the people taking our country back.
[03:06:11.537 --> 03:06:13.699]  But I mean, honestly, it's hard to really put into words.
[03:06:13.699 --> 03:06:17.841]  It's hard to really vocalize what exactly I'm witnessing.
[03:06:17.841 --> 03:06:18.482]  I mean, the images
[03:06:19.182 --> 03:06:23.904]  We'll maybe do it justice, but we're going to have to see what comes of this.
[03:06:23.904 --> 03:06:38.310]  And again, we've just been on the ground leading rallies, leading marches, doing speeches, and it eventually all culminated here at the Capitol, which again, I'd say at least 100,000 people I'm looking at on one side of the Capitol, and this isn't even the side they breached.
[03:06:38.310 --> 03:06:40.331]  This is the side of the inauguration
[03:06:41.091 --> 03:06:41.912]  We're good to go.
[03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:17.421]  Yes, we are skipping all breaks.
[03:07:17.421 --> 03:07:18.981]  You're breaking up just a little bit there.
[03:07:18.981 --> 03:07:22.102]  Maybe if we can re-secure that connection, we can come back to you.
[03:07:22.102 --> 03:07:25.202]  Just let me give you a quick update here.
[03:07:25.202 --> 03:07:27.443]  Hundreds of protesters now inside the U.S.
[03:07:27.443 --> 03:07:28.403]  Capitol building.
[03:07:28.403 --> 03:07:30.023]  At least one woman has been shot.
[03:07:30.023 --> 03:07:33.904]  She may be the first casualty of the second American Revolution.
[03:07:33.904 --> 03:07:36.825]  A woman looked like she was in at least a critical condition.
[03:07:37.665 --> 03:07:44.389]  A first responder EMS worker palpitating her heart as she was rushed off the scene on a gurney.
[03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:48.792]  Blood pouring out from a wound that looked to be in her chest, perhaps her collarbone.
[03:07:48.792 --> 03:07:51.053]  All the reports say she was shot in the arm.
[03:07:51.053 --> 03:07:58.037]  The report is that this was a bullet fired through the door of the chamber, the congressional chamber.
[03:07:58.037 --> 03:08:01.159]  The furniture piled up there as protesters tried to breach.
[03:08:01.159 --> 03:08:04.221]  We have many videos, many images of
[03:08:05.021 --> 03:08:06.824]  People inside Senate offices.
[03:08:06.824 --> 03:08:12.933]  Apparently Baked Alaska is inside one of the offices of popular YouTube streamer, live streamer.
[03:08:12.933 --> 03:08:14.495]  The crowds continue to grow.
[03:08:14.495 --> 03:08:18.381]  A curfew has been issued for 6 p.m.
[03:08:18.381 --> 03:08:19.382]  by the mayor of
[03:08:20.023 --> 03:08:20.664]  D.C.
[03:08:20.664 --> 03:08:27.169]  Nancy Pelosi has requested the National Guard come in to clear out the Capitol, but that request has been denied by the Pentagon.
[03:08:27.169 --> 03:08:29.431]  Protesters roaming the rooms of the U.S.
[03:08:29.431 --> 03:08:47.065]  Capitol on live stream with complete abandon, complete access to any information they require because this happened so fast that the senators and congressmen were not able to actually do anything to... My God, I'm seeing this image again of this woman.
[03:08:47.065 --> 03:08:48.226]  I mean, the blood is everywhere.
[03:08:49.878 --> 03:08:50.960]  I think that woman's dead.
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:55.046]  I honestly think this woman has been severely injured, if not
[03:08:56.946 --> 03:08:59.307]  If not killed.
[03:08:59.307 --> 03:09:00.548]  This is serious, folks.
[03:09:00.548 --> 03:09:02.909]  President Trump in a tweet says, I'm asking for everybody at the U.S.
[03:09:02.909 --> 03:09:04.590]  Capitol to remain peaceful.
[03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:05.690]  No violence.
[03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:08.132]  This is following a woman having been shot.
[03:09:08.132 --> 03:09:20.218]  We have people inside the Capitol in the marble staircases, climbing the walls from within, waving Trump flags, standing at the Speaker's position in the Senate and Congressional chambers.
[03:09:21.775 --> 03:09:22.896]  At least one person shot.
[03:09:22.896 --> 03:09:25.397]  That's the woman that we saw on screen.
[03:09:25.397 --> 03:09:27.658]  Hundreds of protesters now within the Capitol.
[03:09:27.658 --> 03:09:31.139]  People are responding to this in almost predictable ways.
[03:09:31.139 --> 03:09:35.061]  You have people such as Eric Erickson.
[03:09:35.061 --> 03:09:44.825]  Yeah, Eric Erickson saying, shoot the protesters, waive the rules, impeach, waive the rules, convict, waive the rules, deny the ability to run for election again, which of course was their plan anyway and all along.
[03:09:44.825 --> 03:09:47.727]  Here we're seeing images of the security officers firing.
[03:09:49.008 --> 03:09:50.391]  So, we're not doing breaks anymore.
[03:09:50.391 --> 03:09:52.376]  I can ignore that break clock.
[03:09:52.376 --> 03:09:56.905]  Are we still live?
[03:09:56.905 --> 03:09:57.928]  As far as I know, we're still live.
[03:09:59.696 --> 03:10:00.176]  Okay, all right.
[03:10:00.176 --> 03:10:03.037]  Yeah, we're skipping all breaks all day today.
[03:10:03.037 --> 03:10:12.459]  This is a historic moment and we need to be live without the interruptions that are pre-programmed by our radio station affiliates.
[03:10:12.459 --> 03:10:23.662]  So we'll keep going through any and all breaks and I'll continue to be here until we get set up with a secure connection to the InfoWars team that's on the ground there in Washington, D.C., including Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer.
[03:10:23.662 --> 03:10:28.663]  And as soon as we get that up and running, they will take over and let us know exactly what's going on.
[03:10:29.523 --> 03:10:31.224]  Just getting updates from all around.
[03:10:31.224 --> 03:10:45.372]  So Eric Erickson, a blue checkmark on Twitter, advocating to simply shoot all of the protesters, to waive the rules, impeach, waive the rules, convict, waive the rules, deny the ability to run for election ever again.
[03:10:47.401 --> 03:10:49.242]  Which of course, this is a reaction, right?
[03:10:49.242 --> 03:11:02.710]  They riot for an entire year, they burn down entire American cities, they murder over 30 people, they shoot down Trump protesters in cold blood, but if you dare to simply put up your hand in protest to them, then you're an evil Nazi.
[03:11:03.170 --> 03:11:13.212]  On the other hand, if you start to protest, if you start to gather in mass and break down doors and storm the Capitol building, you deserve to be shot.
[03:11:13.212 --> 03:11:14.272]  You deserve to be murdered.
[03:11:14.272 --> 03:11:21.574]  Your entire political party and everyone involved deserve to be barred forever from holding office.
[03:11:21.574 --> 03:11:23.134]  This is what's at stake, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:23.134 --> 03:11:26.295]  This is what is being decided right now.
[03:11:26.295 --> 03:11:28.775]  Donald Trump says, I am asking for everyone at the U.S.
[03:11:28.775 --> 03:11:29.855]  Capitol to remain peaceful.
[03:11:29.855 --> 03:11:30.336]  No violence.
[03:11:30.336 --> 03:11:31.896]  Remember, we are the party of law and order.
[03:11:31.896 --> 03:11:32.516]  Respect the law.
[03:11:32.816 --> 03:11:34.079]  And our great men and women in blue.
[03:11:34.079 --> 03:11:38.347]  The problem with that, Mr. President, is that we have.
[03:11:38.347 --> 03:11:40.030]  We have for four years.
[03:11:40.030 --> 03:11:41.273]  And we've been abused for four years.
[03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:43.390]  We've tried to remain peaceful.
[03:11:43.390 --> 03:11:45.551]  We've tried to remain law-abiding.
[03:11:45.551 --> 03:12:01.173]  For the last years, our cities were burned around us as we were locked inside of our own homes, as criminals were given complete abandon, as time after time, Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters were arrested in violent acts and then released the next day to perform them again.
[03:12:01.173 --> 03:12:03.934]  Time and time again, we have tried to be the party of law and order.
[03:12:03.934 --> 03:12:08.455]  We have tried to respect the status quo, the laws, the system, as we wish to uphold it.
[03:12:10.267 --> 03:12:15.172]  We've been disappointed, we've been betrayed, we've been stabbed in the back literally many times.
[03:12:15.172 --> 03:12:23.560]  Now perhaps the patience has run out and we're seeing images here on the screen of this woman who was shot, who was taken out on the
[03:12:26.164 --> 03:12:28.387]  Gurney that we saw earlier.
[03:12:28.387 --> 03:12:30.469]  She is not looking responsive.
[03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:34.033]  We see people there attempting to put pressure on the wound.
[03:12:34.033 --> 03:12:37.477]  We saw the aftermath of this as she's wheeled away from the store.
[03:12:37.477 --> 03:12:38.899]  My God, this is brutal, folks.
[03:12:38.899 --> 03:12:41.201]  This is incredibly brutal.
[03:12:41.201 --> 03:12:41.982]  Wow.
[03:12:41.982 --> 03:12:43.344]  This is absolutely incredible.
[03:12:46.192 --> 03:12:52.901]  But again, once again, what you're seeing from the left is they want total authoritarianism.
[03:12:52.901 --> 03:13:01.132]  They want a complete shutdown of any and all ability for Trump supporters or conservatives to stand up for
[03:13:02.152 --> 03:13:07.894]  So far the only violence that has been committed this day has been against the protesters who are there.
[03:13:07.894 --> 03:13:09.935]  We just saw a protester shot.
[03:13:09.935 --> 03:13:13.176]  I would not be surprised if we soon receive reports that she's passed away.
[03:13:13.176 --> 03:13:14.636]  That was a brutal shot.
[03:13:14.636 --> 03:13:15.837]  It looked like right to her chest.
[03:13:15.837 --> 03:13:22.819]  These were people trying to get in through the door of the chamber and apparently she was shot by a security guard.
[03:13:22.819 --> 03:13:24.760]  That's the reports that we're hearing on the ground.
[03:13:24.760 --> 03:13:25.900]  These are unconfirmed but this is
[03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:29.301]  All the information that we have so far.
[03:13:29.301 --> 03:13:39.102]  Once again, you have to think about the fact that for six months and for years before that, how many times did we see leftists try to tear down the doors of the Capitol building?
[03:13:39.102 --> 03:13:44.283]  We saw leftists during the Kavanaugh hearings attempting to tear down the door.
[03:13:44.283 --> 03:13:54.965]  Can you imagine if one of these protesters, unarmed, peaceful, attempting to simply open a door, is shot at point-blank in cold blood by one of these
[03:13:55.865 --> 03:13:57.486]  One of these Capitol Police.
[03:13:57.486 --> 03:13:58.767]  This is egregious.
[03:13:58.767 --> 03:13:59.708]  This is unacceptable.
[03:13:59.708 --> 03:14:03.830]  Tear gas now being deployed within the Capitol.
[03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:05.511]  This is shocking and astonishing.
[03:14:05.511 --> 03:14:22.663]  And again, the only violence I have seen perpetrated so far beyond, you know, one or two punches in return for a punch thrown by a police officer, the only violence I have seen has been the cold-blooded point-blank shooting of a woman in the chest by the Capitol Police.
[03:14:24.744 --> 03:14:27.025]  This is disturbing.
[03:14:27.025 --> 03:14:29.827]  And of course, the leftists are saying, just shoot them all.
[03:14:29.827 --> 03:14:32.508]  You know, if you dare protest against us, we can protest.
[03:14:32.508 --> 03:14:34.209]  We can burn your city down for a year and a half.
[03:14:34.209 --> 03:14:39.111]  We can, you know, for a year, for four years, we can just obstruct everything.
[03:14:39.111 --> 03:14:40.112]  We can destroy everything.
[03:14:40.112 --> 03:14:41.573]  We can murder people in cold blood.
[03:14:41.573 --> 03:14:43.634]  Vice Magazine will give us a...
[03:14:44.674 --> 03:14:54.200]  A good 30 minute documentary in order to air our views, to smear the dead man, to call him racist and a bigot and a Nazi in order to justify his death.
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:57.663]  That's the reaction you get if you are a protester on the left.
[03:14:57.663 --> 03:15:11.512]  You get complete carte blanche, even if you're caught in the act, even if you resist arrest, even if you attack police officers, you'll be taken to the prosecutor who takes their orders from the Soros-funded organizations to let you go immediately, punish you, not at all.
[03:15:11.912 --> 03:15:18.578]  And allow you the very next day to go out and destroy and cavort once again.
[03:15:18.578 --> 03:15:21.961]  So, tables have turned.
[03:15:21.961 --> 03:15:36.914]  If you're a Republican, if you are a conservative, if you actually protest in an effective and aggressive way, in the exact same way that has been protested for the last year, you apparently deserve to be shot down in cold blood.
[03:15:36.914 --> 03:15:39.036]  Even though you're unarmed, even though you're peaceful,
[03:15:39.935 --> 03:15:43.859]  Even though, as we've heard time and time again, hey, things can be replaced!
[03:15:43.859 --> 03:15:46.562]  Stuff can be replaced!
[03:15:46.562 --> 03:15:52.828]  Well, you'll be shot down, cold, dead, your blood spilling on the floor of the Capitol.
[03:15:52.828 --> 03:15:57.352]  This is absolutely incredible.
[03:15:57.352 --> 03:15:58.613]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[03:15:58.613 --> 03:16:00.055]  Hundreds of protesters now in the U.S.
[03:16:00.055 --> 03:16:00.335]  Capitol.
[03:16:02.930 --> 03:16:03.511]  Being spread.
[03:16:03.511 --> 03:16:05.313]  Looks like we're getting more updates.
[03:16:05.313 --> 03:16:10.198]  Protesters now on the House floor rifling through lawmakers' desks.
[03:16:10.198 --> 03:16:12.861]  It'll be interesting to see what information comes from this.
[03:16:12.861 --> 03:16:19.308]  People are already investigating the things that are being found on stuff like Nancy Pelosi's computer.
[03:16:20.842 --> 03:16:31.268]  And of course, on the right, people on Twitter are now reposting tweets from people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who says, the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable.
[03:16:31.268 --> 03:16:36.011]  Activists take that discomfort with the status quo and advocate for concrete policy changes.
[03:16:36.011 --> 03:16:38.612]  Popular support often starts small and grows.
[03:16:38.612 --> 03:16:44.516]  The folks who complain, protest, demands, make others uncomfortable, that's the point.
[03:16:44.516 --> 03:16:47.298]  And the double standard rises again if the
[03:16:48.427 --> 03:16:51.569]  Democrats didn't have a double standard, they wouldn't have standards at all.
[03:16:51.569 --> 03:16:57.092]  Milo Yiannopoulos writes out on Twitter, quote, all I need now is Alex Jones in the Speaker's chair.
[03:16:57.092 --> 03:17:02.795]  Alex Jones, Owen Schroer, and the InfoWars crew is not currently inside the Capitol.
[03:17:02.795 --> 03:17:04.596]  I don't believe they're even on the Capitol grounds.
[03:17:04.596 --> 03:17:14.041]  I think they're in a secure building just a little ways away, overlooking all of this chaos going on and attempting and trying and striving to set up
[03:17:14.361 --> 03:17:15.002]  I don't know.
[03:17:33.217 --> 03:17:36.440]  Of course, this is standard for the Democrats.
[03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:48.713]  They have said time and time again, as this election has wound down, the moment Donald Trump is out of office, they'll be prosecuting him, they'll be prosecuting anybody that supported him, they'll be sending to jail anybody that dared to support the President of the United States.
[03:17:48.713 --> 03:17:54.399]  That, in and of itself, is a greater threat to the American system and the Republic, as fragile as it is.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:04.829]  Sentiment, those expressions are more of a threat to our system and our country than this protest ever could be.
[03:18:04.829 --> 03:18:19.504]  Once the system itself starts persecuting people politically, starts prosecuting people for their political views, starts punishing people with the full weight and force of the state behind them because of their differing political views, that is the death
[03:18:19.924 --> 03:18:20.244]  Of course.
[03:18:40.287 --> 03:18:48.171]  I've seen one or two throw a punch here or there, but I think all those people have been sort of arrested and pulled away.
[03:18:48.171 --> 03:18:53.193]  I've seen no violence on behalf of the protesters, only being committed against them.
[03:18:53.193 --> 03:18:58.615]  So Ted Cruz can tell the police officers, don't shoot peaceful protesters.
[03:18:58.615 --> 03:19:04.258]  How about the police don't gun down innocent protesters who are unarmed.
[03:19:04.258 --> 03:19:05.278]  Because that's what's happening right now.
[03:19:05.278 --> 03:19:06.079]  That's what's just happened.
[03:19:06.889 --> 03:19:15.814]  And we've not received an update yet of that young woman who was shot point-blank through a window by the Capital City Police.
[03:19:15.814 --> 03:19:28.822]  That's what we're seeing now, and we're seeing rifle-armed, terrified-looking police officers, Capitol officers, keeping people down like hostages there in or near the rotunda.
[03:19:30.416 --> 03:19:42.219]  Yes, leftists advocating to shoot the protesters while being presented with their own sentiments from earlier this year saying that protests are good.
[03:19:42.219 --> 03:19:44.560]  You're supposed to be uncomfortable.
[03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:46.100]  You're supposed to be uncomfortable.
[03:19:46.100 --> 03:19:48.961]  Crowd continues to increase in size.
[03:19:48.961 --> 03:19:56.123]  We'll continue to bring you updates, videos, images, and information as we get it.
[03:19:56.123 --> 03:19:56.523]  My God.
[03:19:58.386 --> 03:20:05.088]  The images of this gunshot victim are truly harrowing.
[03:20:05.088 --> 03:20:10.710]  Hard drives from offices in the Capitol have been taken by citizens.
[03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:12.190]  This is bananas.
[03:20:12.190 --> 03:20:21.433]  It looks like the people who have been able to successfully break into Senate offices and Congressional offices did so with such swiftness that the
[03:20:22.513 --> 03:20:34.015]  The staffers and congressmen and senators there were unable to even grab their information, grab their papers, or even shut down their computers.
[03:20:34.015 --> 03:20:46.497]  So now, unlocked and open to anybody, those computers are being accessed by the protesters, who themselves are gathering information, downloading hard drives, or stealing the hard drives outright.
[03:20:46.497 --> 03:20:50.678]  We can expect to see the fallout from this continue on for a very long time.
[03:20:50.678 --> 03:20:51.498]  But I remind you again,
[03:20:51.918 --> 03:21:12.152]  After a year of complete chaos, a year of protest, a year of literally tens of thousands of violent riots with dozens of murders, I mean just trillions of dollars worth of damage, maybe not trillions, but many, many billions of dollars worth of damage to American cities.
[03:21:12.152 --> 03:21:14.114]  We have heard time and time again how valuable
[03:21:14.674 --> 03:21:29.440]  Uh, protests are how good protests are, how Antifa is only an idea, how Black Lives Matter is, uh, simply a set of beliefs that if you don't believe you're racist, uh, and we've watched silently because we always knew that the end of the day we had our vote.
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:38.704]  We always knew that when it came right down to it, the American system was powerful enough, flexible enough, good enough to
[03:21:40.174 --> 03:21:53.541]  Maintain and we knew that if we just trusted and exerted our rights as members of a Republican citizens of this democracy that we could regain our footing and get back on track.
[03:21:53.541 --> 03:21:55.882]  Well, that vote has been stolen from us.
[03:21:55.882 --> 03:21:59.544]  If you're wondering what is inspiring the overwhelming.
[03:22:01.545 --> 03:22:01.846]  I think?
[03:22:19.872 --> 03:22:24.977]  For so long have patiently stood by and watched their country literally burned around them.
[03:22:24.977 --> 03:22:28.280]  Now I haven't seen any of these protesters tear down statues.
[03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:31.384]  I haven't seen any of these protesters commit violence.
[03:22:31.384 --> 03:22:33.486]  I haven't seen any of them attack police.
[03:22:33.486 --> 03:22:39.171]  In fact, quite to the contrary, I've seen police retreating with Trump protesters standing in front of the
[03:22:39.932 --> 03:22:45.117]  Police officers holding up their hands, preventing other protesters from doing anything untoward.
[03:22:45.117 --> 03:22:47.680]  This just in from Disclose.TV, D.C.
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:50.443]  Mayor Bowser is asking again to deploy the National Guard.
[03:22:50.443 --> 03:22:56.629]  Pentagon is considering it, but concerned about uniformed troops in the Capitol.
[03:22:56.629 --> 03:23:02.415]  That would be a major, major, major step in the history of America to have
[03:23:02.935 --> 03:23:05.936]  The United States Army occupy the Capitol.
[03:23:05.936 --> 03:23:11.738]  Now nothing like this, as far as I know, has ever occurred in the history of the United States.
[03:23:11.738 --> 03:23:18.441]  This is a utterly unique situation, an unprecedented situation, that we are now watching live.
[03:23:18.441 --> 03:23:30.005]  And of course, if you are not watching InfoWars, you may be getting your information from one of the mainstream sources, in which case you are just now hearing that, quote, police draw guns inside U.S.
[03:23:30.005 --> 03:23:31.206]  Congress to protect
[03:23:35.509 --> 03:23:37.070]  To protect lawmakers.
[03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.390]  Okay?
[03:23:37.390 --> 03:23:58.479]  The reality is guns were drawn, a standoff ensued, and an unarmed protester was shot in the chest and has now been evacuated and from all appearances is in critical condition at least with her heart, her chest being palpitated by the emergency responder as she's wheeled away on a gurney, blood pouring forth from that wound.
[03:23:58.479 --> 03:23:59.760]  This is the up-to-date information.
[03:24:02.066 --> 03:24:03.327]  One woman in critical condition.
[03:24:03.327 --> 03:24:03.848]  Thank God.
[03:24:03.848 --> 03:24:04.308]  Oh my God.
[03:24:04.308 --> 03:24:04.629]  All right.
[03:24:04.629 --> 03:24:05.389]  I thought she was dead.
[03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:06.771]  I thought for sure this woman had died.
[03:24:06.771 --> 03:24:09.013]  It's still touch and go.
[03:24:09.013 --> 03:24:11.315]  Obviously, critical condition means anything could happen.
[03:24:11.315 --> 03:24:13.937]  But this is the update from BNO News on Twitter.
[03:24:13.937 --> 03:24:17.340]  One woman in critical condition after being shot in the chest at the U.S.
[03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:18.261]  Capitol.
[03:24:18.261 --> 03:24:20.563]  Truly incredible.
[03:24:20.563 --> 03:24:21.524]  Truly incredible.
[03:24:21.524 --> 03:24:26.028]  We're seeing images of this event come across.
[03:24:26.028 --> 03:24:26.529]  And once again,
[03:24:28.700 --> 03:24:33.885]  Just imagine, just imagine folks, if this had been a leftist, antifa, Black Lives Matter.
[03:24:33.885 --> 03:24:35.306]  First of all, the police would have backed down.
[03:24:35.306 --> 03:24:38.029]  The police would have kneeled.
[03:24:38.029 --> 03:24:44.555]  The police would have joined them, no doubt, on the behest of their corrupt, crooked city government.
[03:24:44.555 --> 03:24:48.179]  Instead, gunshots fired.
[03:24:48.179 --> 03:24:52.043]  Bullets shot at the peaceful protesters.
[03:24:53.373 --> 03:24:55.335]  And one woman now in critical condition.
[03:24:55.335 --> 03:24:55.935]  Thank God.
[03:24:55.935 --> 03:25:02.040]  We're praying for her because I thought for sure from that image that she would not, not make it.
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:03.961]  Woman who was trying to breach the doors inside the U.S.
[03:25:03.961 --> 03:25:06.763]  Capitol was shot in the neck by the Capitol Police.
[03:25:06.763 --> 03:25:11.667]  She's since been brought out of the building on a stretcher.
[03:25:11.667 --> 03:25:13.208]  This is, this is absolutely absurd.
[03:25:13.208 --> 03:25:19.733]  And we're hearing, uh, we're hearing calls from a Republican and you know, it's almost, I don't know.
[03:25:21.823 --> 03:25:23.345]  I don't want to say anything I shouldn't say.
[03:25:38.911 --> 03:25:49.553]  Again, after six months, eight months, an entire year of protests by Antifa and Black Lives Matter, you ask a Democratic lawmaker about it, he says, I never even heard of such a thing.
[03:25:49.553 --> 03:25:50.833]  What is this defund the police?
[03:25:50.833 --> 03:25:52.574]  I've never heard anybody say defund the police.
[03:25:52.574 --> 03:25:54.774]  That's what Bernie Sanders said.
[03:25:54.774 --> 03:25:55.614]  Jerry Nadler.
[03:25:55.614 --> 03:25:58.415]  Antifa is just an idea, right?
[03:25:58.415 --> 03:26:00.135]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[03:26:00.135 --> 03:26:03.296]  Meanwhile, we are about two hours into this
[03:26:04.196 --> 03:26:31.339]  Insanity going on in the Capitol building and already Republican lawmakers are condemning their own supporters, telling them that they're at fault, that they're the ones being violent, while the only violence that I've seen perpetrated thus far have been flashbangs fired into the Trump crowds and a woman shot in the chest and neck area who is now in critical condition after being fired upon point-blank while she was trying to open a door into the Congressional Chamber.
[03:26:34.853 --> 03:26:37.376]  It's an illustration, isn't it?
[03:26:37.376 --> 03:26:41.201]  It's an example of the two different approaches.
[03:26:41.201 --> 03:26:45.306]  Now, again, for a year, the Patriots have put up with the chaos.
[03:26:45.306 --> 03:26:47.268]  They've put up with the destruction.
[03:26:47.268 --> 03:26:54.237]  They have held their tongue, kept their guns holstered, kept their weapons at their side, and allowed
[03:26:56.018 --> 03:27:09.268]  The literal, I mean, communist agitators funded, paid for by foreigners, trained by Chinese communists, and they've been allowed to perpetrate the most egregious violence all over the United States for a year.
[03:27:09.268 --> 03:27:20.156]  And it seems like, finally, after having been robbed of their last release, that final chance that we can at least vote, we at least have our vote, you know?
[03:27:20.156 --> 03:27:22.297]  All that got robbed from them.
[03:27:23.260 --> 03:27:30.902]  And was in the process of being robbed from them today when all of this chaos broke out.
[03:27:30.902 --> 03:27:31.282]  I'm serious.
[03:27:31.282 --> 03:27:34.922]  I don't think there's... I have not seen violence from the protesters.
[03:27:34.922 --> 03:27:36.503]  I've seen them tear down barriers.
[03:27:36.503 --> 03:27:38.203]  I've seen them break windows.
[03:27:38.203 --> 03:27:40.764]  I've seen them push and shove at cops.
[03:27:40.764 --> 03:27:44.985]  I've seen one guy throw a punch at a cop after the cop punched him.
[03:27:44.985 --> 03:27:46.805]  I've seen mace being sprayed in both directions.
[03:27:48.376 --> 03:28:13.015]  I've seen a mere percentage of a percentage of the violence we saw on nearly a daily basis starting in about March of last year and continuing all the way through the summer with tens of thousands of riots, a large portion of which were not just violent but deadly at the hands of protesters who were never caught, never punished, and never even addressed or acknowledged by their
[03:28:14.165 --> 03:28:14.825]  I don't
[03:28:36.553 --> 03:28:38.954]  Sending soldiers into the Capitol.
[03:28:38.954 --> 03:28:43.797]  It looks like the Virginia National Guard and 200 state troopers are now being deployed to Washington, D.C.
[03:28:43.797 --> 03:28:50.140]  We've heard reports of Georgia and Kansas state houses both having been occupied, both having been attacked.
[03:28:50.140 --> 03:28:59.866]  And we're seeing live view on Fox News and other places of heavily armed, heavily armored police officers moving towards the U.S.
[03:28:59.866 --> 03:29:01.967]  Capitol.
[03:29:01.967 --> 03:29:04.928]  And again, that woman who was shot is in critical condition as of now.
[03:29:06.448 --> 03:29:17.354]  And again, now we're also seeing from Tim Dunn on Twitter the tunnels that were used to bring up.
[03:29:17.354 --> 03:29:23.397]  So it looks like this is just mind-blowing, folks.
[03:29:23.397 --> 03:29:27.600]  I'm having trouble.
[03:29:29.875 --> 03:29:32.316]  Getting a good grip on exactly what's going on.
[03:29:32.316 --> 03:29:37.498]  From BNO News, a large number of police and SWAT vehicles are moving towards Washington D.C.
[03:29:37.498 --> 03:29:38.598]  right now.
[03:29:38.598 --> 03:29:44.220]  And we actually have a video of the police officer shooting the woman inside the United States Capitol building.
[03:29:44.220 --> 03:29:56.885]  And again, just imagine, folks, if on the first day of Black Lives Matter rallies, Black Lives Matter riots, one of their protesters who was unarmed, a woman, was shot at point-blank range in the chest.
[03:29:57.685 --> 03:29:58.766]  By a police officer.
[03:29:58.766 --> 03:30:00.507]  Would we ever hear the end of it?
[03:30:00.507 --> 03:30:10.556]  Would this not be an example of the tyranny of the fascism that they love to portray?
[03:30:10.556 --> 03:30:12.618]  The violence and destruction taking place at the U.S.
[03:30:12.618 --> 03:30:13.438]  Capitol must stop.
[03:30:13.438 --> 03:30:14.659]  This is a tweet by Mike Pence.
[03:30:14.659 --> 03:30:16.721]  The violence and destruction taking place at the U.S.
[03:30:16.721 --> 03:30:18.683]  Capitol must stop and it must stop now.
[03:30:18.683 --> 03:30:22.126]  Anybody involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.
[03:30:23.899 --> 03:30:31.541]  We continue to say peaceful protest is the right of every American, but this attack on our capital will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[03:30:31.541 --> 03:30:32.542]  Wouldn't that be a change?
[03:30:32.542 --> 03:30:34.162]  Wouldn't that be something new?
[03:30:34.162 --> 03:30:37.983]  Protestors prosecuted.
[03:30:37.983 --> 03:30:52.228]  How many hundreds of thousands of people have been arrested in places like Portland, Washington, Minnesota, Michigan, have been taken to the prosecutor, released that very day,
[03:30:53.834 --> 03:30:58.216]  To be out on the street committing the same crime, being arrested once again the very next day.
[03:30:58.216 --> 03:31:01.137]  Time and time again, this has occurred.
[03:31:01.137 --> 03:31:02.538]  But I wouldn't doubt it.
[03:31:02.538 --> 03:31:04.019]  I wouldn't put it past them.
[03:31:04.019 --> 03:31:16.684]  You know that the way our country is right now, the full force and weight of every single system, every single law enforcement agency will be brought to bear.
[03:31:16.684 --> 03:31:21.947]  And they will attempt to make an example out of anybody and everybody involved in this.
[03:31:27.025 --> 03:31:33.829]  Where we go from here is hard to tell, hard to say.
[03:31:33.829 --> 03:31:37.351]  Trump encouraging his supporters to stay peaceful, which they have.
[03:31:37.351 --> 03:31:39.032]  They absolutely have.
[03:31:39.032 --> 03:31:42.354]  Once again, no, I didn't see any people attacking police.
[03:31:42.354 --> 03:31:48.097]  I didn't see them throwing rocks or bricks at the police, as we saw in places like Chicago throughout the summer.
[03:31:52.759 --> 03:31:53.740]  Who's this?
[03:31:53.740 --> 03:31:58.202]  Representative David Trone says, I'm safe, we've been evacuated.
[03:31:58.202 --> 03:32:01.184]  Let me be clear, we will not be stopped by this lawless intimidation.
[03:32:01.184 --> 03:32:03.725]  That's how you got here, isn't it?
[03:32:03.725 --> 03:32:05.206]  Lawless intimidation.
[03:32:05.206 --> 03:32:07.467]  Isn't that what brought us to this point?
[03:32:07.467 --> 03:32:15.431]  The lawlessness and intimidation being exerted by Black Lives Matter and Antifa for the better part of a year.
[03:32:15.431 --> 03:32:19.794]  And once again, I mean, if this were the Democrats doing it,
[03:32:21.069 --> 03:32:28.134]  We would see exactly the same images that we see here today and the Democrats would be out there saying, Trump supporters don't exist.
[03:32:28.134 --> 03:32:30.596]  That's a fiction of your imagination.
[03:32:30.596 --> 03:32:32.397]  That's what Jerry Nadler said.
[03:32:32.397 --> 03:32:36.520]  He said Antifa is a fiction, a part of your imagination.
[03:32:36.520 --> 03:32:37.381]  It's a fiction.
[03:32:37.381 --> 03:32:38.181]  It's a lie.
[03:32:38.181 --> 03:32:38.942]  It doesn't exist.
[03:32:38.942 --> 03:32:40.723]  It's a right-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:32:40.723 --> 03:32:47.648]  That's what he said about Antifa months and months after the riots had begun and continued on a daily basis.
[03:32:47.648 --> 03:32:48.529]  He said it doesn't exist.
[03:32:50.643 --> 03:32:54.185]  Kaylin McKinney at President Trump's directive, the National Guard.
[03:32:54.185 --> 03:32:55.525]  Okay, alright.
[03:32:55.525 --> 03:33:01.088]  So President Trump is sending the National Guard now.
[03:33:01.088 --> 03:33:03.650]  He never sent it for Antifa.
[03:33:03.650 --> 03:33:07.191]  Okay, we have Owen Schroer now overlooking the U.S.
[03:33:07.191 --> 03:33:07.932]  Capitol.
[03:33:07.932 --> 03:33:11.974]  Massive crowds over his shoulder.
[03:33:11.974 --> 03:33:14.515]  Doing a quick audio check.
[03:33:14.515 --> 03:33:16.316]  Let me know whenever he can hear me.
[03:33:16.316 --> 03:33:17.296]  Owen, can you read me?
[03:33:22.355 --> 03:33:26.617]  Alright folks, we have Owen Schroer and the InfoWars crew in Washington DC overlooking the US Capitol.
[03:33:26.617 --> 03:33:30.558]  We now go live to Owen Schroer in Washington DC.
[03:33:30.558 --> 03:33:50.467]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I'm really not quite sure how to tell you the history that we're witnessing here today other than for you to just see the actual images of millions of patriots rallying for Trump today, chanting USA.
[03:33:54.329 --> 03:34:01.213]  Capitol building where they have now breached the grounds and are now surrounding the Capitol building.
[03:34:01.213 --> 03:34:05.356]  Now, these are the types of events that go down in history.
[03:34:05.356 --> 03:34:11.019]  This January 6th, 2021 will no doubt go down in American history.
[03:34:11.019 --> 03:34:15.302]  Now, what will that history say about today?
[03:34:15.302 --> 03:34:17.043]  We're here fighting for President Trump.
[03:34:17.043 --> 03:34:18.904]  We're here fighting for our elections.
[03:34:18.904 --> 03:34:20.285]  We're here fighting for the Republic.
[03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:29.987]  We want to use this day as we're seeing all the traitors in the Republican Party and Congress everywhere stab us in the back.
[03:34:29.987 --> 03:34:31.988]  We all know Trump won.
[03:34:31.988 --> 03:34:33.049]  We all know they stole it.
[03:34:33.049 --> 03:34:38.554]  We saw the hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots that gave Biden the victory in Georgia come in at 6am.
[03:34:38.554 --> 03:34:40.015]  They counted for weeks.
[03:34:40.015 --> 03:34:45.019]  We saw the hundred thousand ballots that came in for Biden in Michigan at 6am that gave him.
[03:34:50.447 --> 03:34:54.292]  We all saw it happen, and they want to tell us, oh no, that didn't happen.
[03:34:54.292 --> 03:34:55.153]  That's not happening.
[03:34:55.153 --> 03:35:02.402]  Kind of like when they go on air, when there's burning buildings behind them, and they say this is a peaceful protest, but there's burning buildings behind them.
[03:35:02.402 --> 03:35:02.843]  Holding a break.
[03:35:04.320 --> 03:35:05.961]  ...a peaceful protest.
[03:35:05.961 --> 03:35:10.722]  Nothing has been burned, but then people apparently have been shot inside the Capitol.
[03:35:10.722 --> 03:35:12.782]  Now, we're still getting intel on what that is.
[03:35:12.782 --> 03:35:18.964]  We've gotten to a safe location because it was just too crazy out there on the streets, but... And that was Capitol Police?
[03:35:18.964 --> 03:35:20.144]  That's probably false.
[03:35:20.144 --> 03:35:20.965]  That's the left, probably.
[03:35:20.965 --> 03:35:21.765]  We're getting later in.
[03:35:21.765 --> 03:35:22.925]  The intel is probably false.
[03:35:22.925 --> 03:35:23.865]  What's false?
[03:35:23.865 --> 03:35:24.906]  The shooting inside.
[03:35:24.906 --> 03:35:27.406]  Well, there was... I mean, a woman kind of came out in a gurney bleeding.
[03:35:27.406 --> 03:35:29.287]  So I don't know who... We don't know who did it.
[03:35:29.287 --> 03:35:29.967]  When is this crazy?
[03:35:30.447 --> 03:35:37.833]  Point is, there's video now of the shooting having taken place.
[03:35:37.833 --> 03:35:42.417]  Pence has also betrayed President Donald Trump.
[03:35:42.417 --> 03:35:48.222]  Trump is now a man on a mountain by himself, and he has we the people fighting for him.
[03:35:48.222 --> 03:35:52.345]  By the way, the police just confirmed one woman was shot in the leg inside the Capitol.
[03:35:52.345 --> 03:35:57.309]  So we've had one person shot, but again, they breached the building and they got in.
[03:35:58.638 --> 03:36:04.346]  While they were voting to either certify or debate whether they were going to certify for Biden or not.
[03:36:04.346 --> 03:36:06.169]  And that's when it happened.
[03:36:06.169 --> 03:36:07.851]  And so all hell is broken loose.
[03:36:07.851 --> 03:36:13.499]  They have Congress in the underground tunnels, which we told you they were going to do yesterday.
[03:36:13.499 --> 03:36:15.041]  And in fact, they did do yesterday.
[03:36:15.041 --> 03:36:15.381]  So look.
[03:36:16.431 --> 03:36:18.233]  We want freedom.
[03:36:18.233 --> 03:36:19.374]  We want liberty.
[03:36:19.374 --> 03:36:21.355]  And when the government fears the people, we have that.
[03:36:21.355 --> 03:36:34.246]  Now, we don't want them to feel that there's a violent revolution coming, but we want them to know that we the people are not going to stand for their treason, and we the people are not going to stand for rigged elections.
[03:36:35.367 --> 03:36:36.687]  People can debate all day long.
[03:36:36.687 --> 03:36:38.288]  What is the appropriate response?
[03:36:38.288 --> 03:36:42.289]  We're continuing live through the breaks on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:36:42.289 --> 03:36:44.010]  The live streams are continuing.
[03:36:44.010 --> 03:36:47.351]  The radio stations may be going to break now, but we'll be right back on the other side.
[03:36:47.351 --> 03:36:53.613]  But stay with us if you're online because the streams will continue and we go back to Owen Schroer live outside of the Capitol Building.
[03:36:53.613 --> 03:36:55.894]  Our elections has been completely violated.
[03:36:55.894 --> 03:36:57.234]  What is the appropriate response?
[03:36:57.234 --> 03:37:03.877]  Well, you can debate it all day long, but the response we've seen today is millions of Trump supporters rallying in D.C.
[03:37:05.157 --> 03:37:07.559]  Listening to Trump speak, listening to others speak.
[03:37:07.559 --> 03:37:10.280]  They were here yesterday, all night as well.
[03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:13.903]  And then today, coming to the Capitol and breaching the grounds.
[03:37:13.903 --> 03:37:29.453]  Now, we have eyewitness testimony that says it looks like there were agent provocateurs who actually started the breaching procedure, but because there were so many Trump supporters around, it was just like a flood of momentum.
[03:37:29.453 --> 03:37:30.533]  Oh, somebody's coming in.
[03:37:30.533 --> 03:37:32.555]  Oh, the barrier went down.
[03:37:32.555 --> 03:37:33.815]  Oh, now we're just all going in.
[03:37:34.796 --> 03:37:39.540]  Lead to at least one person getting shot, and then just all hell breaking loose.
[03:37:39.540 --> 03:38:01.537]  And last night, there was already some tensions between the local police here and Trump supporters, because they initiated a curfew, said you can't go to bars, you can't go to restaurants, so people are just out in the streets, because they got nowhere else to go, so they're out in the streets, and then the police come in to try to shut them down, rush them, bull rush them, arrest people, and so that caused tension last night.
[03:38:02.398 --> 03:38:06.261]  And then I think that spilled over to today.
[03:38:06.261 --> 03:38:16.470]  We are capturing this history for you right now live on InfoWars and it's really just an incredible thing because I don't think these people are going anywhere.
[03:38:16.470 --> 03:38:26.198]  This crowd has been holding now for at least an hour and they have the building completely surrounded.
[03:38:26.198 --> 03:38:29.381]  Now it is cold out here and it looks to me now
[03:38:30.902 --> 03:38:35.226]  Like people are gathering around different entrances of the Capitol.
[03:38:35.226 --> 03:38:48.399]  So it looks like where the crowd used to be completely dispersed around it, it now looks like there is a funnel, if you will, a surge of people going into a side entrance, and then a surge of people over here.
[03:38:48.399 --> 03:38:51.902]  But as you can see, the inauguration stage that has been set up,
[03:38:52.903 --> 03:38:55.225]  Has been completely overwhelmed.
[03:38:55.225 --> 03:39:00.708]  So they have hung, obviously what is, it looks like about a hundred foot long American flag.
[03:39:00.708 --> 03:39:03.450]  You've got Trump flags everywhere, American flags everywhere.
[03:39:03.450 --> 03:39:11.175]  So we just want to send a peaceful message to the globalists, to the Chinese who own half of our Congress and to Mike Pence and the Congress members.
[03:39:11.175 --> 03:39:12.936]  Hey, we voted for Donald Trump.
[03:39:12.936 --> 03:39:13.756]  He won the election.
[03:39:13.756 --> 03:39:14.177]  You know it.
[03:39:14.177 --> 03:39:20.381]  You better do the right thing and not certify the fake vote for Biden because then it gets even worse.
[03:39:21.181 --> 03:39:24.683]  Hey, it's one thing to have to deal with the theft of our election.
[03:39:24.683 --> 03:39:34.167]  It's another thing to now have to realize we have a compromised foreign agent criminal who is wanted in the country of Ukraine.
[03:39:34.167 --> 03:39:45.373]  He is a wanted felon in the country of Ukraine doing business deals in China, his son in Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, all over the globe so that he can sell us out.
[03:39:45.373 --> 03:39:47.554]  So we don't want to get to that point.
[03:39:47.554 --> 03:39:49.795]  Again, you can debate what is the proper response.
[03:39:50.695 --> 03:39:54.698]  To $2 billion in property damage with no law, and then them stealing our election.
[03:39:54.698 --> 03:39:55.438]  You can debate that.
[03:39:55.438 --> 03:39:57.199]  This is the response we see.
[03:39:57.199 --> 03:40:02.122]  But now the debate will become if truly Pence is going to stab us in the back with the rest of Congress.
[03:40:02.122 --> 03:40:09.386]  Now the debate is, what do you do with a foreign agent as President of the United States that is an illegitimate, unelected President, but a stolen President?
[03:40:09.386 --> 03:40:12.909]  And quite frankly, folks, I've got to be honest here.
[03:40:12.909 --> 03:40:17.491]  We've been on the streets all day.
[03:40:17.491 --> 03:40:18.472]  The energy, the intensity,
[03:40:21.630 --> 03:40:23.831]  It's hard to even know what to say or how to handle it.
[03:40:23.831 --> 03:40:32.436]  And I know that Alex, who has been fighting this battle for so long, and is witnessing this right now, is just almost at a loss of where to go from here.
[03:40:32.436 --> 03:40:36.898]  Well, just so listeners know, we got cut off from our main crew and our main equipment.
[03:40:36.898 --> 03:40:37.859]  They've locked down the city.
[03:40:37.859 --> 03:40:39.620]  It's basically under martial law.
[03:40:39.620 --> 03:40:42.101]  We're trying to get our professional equipment over here.
[03:40:42.101 --> 03:40:43.142]  We're going to go to break.
[03:40:43.142 --> 03:40:43.982]  Harris is going to take over.
[03:40:43.982 --> 03:40:46.644]  We're going to move up under the tents so there's less wind noise.
[03:40:46.644 --> 03:40:48.905]  Take over our area where we already had set up.
[03:40:48.905 --> 03:40:50.166]  We're up here in a media row area.
[03:40:51.046 --> 03:40:56.188]  We're coming back from break here if you're listening to a radio station, but we're going live commercial free on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:40:56.188 --> 03:40:57.388]  Alex Jones reporting outside the U.S.
[03:40:57.388 --> 03:40:57.588]  Capitol.
[03:41:13.456 --> 03:41:16.319]  With elbow pads and knee pads attacking people.
[03:41:16.319 --> 03:41:19.163]  And folks saw him militarily come in.
[03:41:19.163 --> 03:41:21.165]  A lot of vets were over here and they said, yeah, they were very military.
[03:41:24.551 --> 03:41:25.252]  Alright, one second.
[03:41:25.252 --> 03:41:27.473]  Elbow pads and knee pads, kind of grey outfits.
[03:41:27.473 --> 03:41:30.216]  They came in, attacked the riot police, said, let's go, let's do it!
[03:41:30.216 --> 03:41:31.797]  Got some people to follow them.
[03:41:31.797 --> 03:41:34.159]  Then they all pulled out real quick.
[03:41:34.159 --> 03:41:36.521]  And I ran into a bunch of experts who were witnesses to what else happened.
[03:41:36.521 --> 03:41:44.408]  But as soon as I saw the footage, Trump had just announced, I'm going to drive in 20 minutes over there from his big rally for a peaceful protest here at the Capitol.
[03:41:44.408 --> 03:41:46.670]  Within minutes of that, everybody's like, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[03:41:46.670 --> 03:41:48.311]  People are attacking the police!
[03:41:48.311 --> 03:41:49.612]  All this crazy stuff's happening.
[03:41:49.612 --> 03:41:51.193]  All this crazy stuff's going down.
[03:41:51.193 --> 03:41:52.495]  All this crazy stuff's unfolding.
[03:41:53.775 --> 03:41:56.297]  And then boom, I was like, man, they're going to do a provocateur action.
[03:41:56.297 --> 03:41:58.559]  And sure enough, minutes later, that happened.
[03:41:58.559 --> 03:41:59.700]  95% is provocateur.
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:00.341]  We have the witnesses.
[03:42:00.341 --> 03:42:01.362]  We have the footage.
[03:42:01.362 --> 03:42:02.082]  We have so much.
[03:42:02.082 --> 03:42:03.564]  We have the witness footage.
[03:42:03.564 --> 03:42:04.164]  But we're up here.
[03:42:06.184 --> 03:42:08.386]  Again, the city, it goes under a six o'clock curfew.
[03:42:08.386 --> 03:42:10.328]  They've declared an emergency.
[03:42:10.328 --> 03:42:13.010]  All over, somebody randomly getting shot inside the Capitol.
[03:42:13.010 --> 03:42:15.612]  A lot of really weird stuff going on.
[03:42:15.612 --> 03:42:17.634]  But we need to be peaceful, as we've always said.
[03:42:17.634 --> 03:42:19.255]  We're not anti, we're not BLM.
[03:42:19.255 --> 03:42:22.698]  So, InfoWars.com is going to be here covering this all live right now.
[03:42:22.698 --> 03:42:24.139]  Harrison Smith's going to take back over.
[03:42:24.139 --> 03:42:26.061]  We're going to move underneath the awning, get another shot.
[03:42:26.661 --> 03:42:26.841]  Okay.
[03:42:41.484 --> 03:42:42.545]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:42:42.545 --> 03:42:47.466]  Yeah, so we're receiving a lot more information here as we as we move forward.
[03:42:47.466 --> 03:42:50.987]  We are going commercial free on the live streams.
[03:42:50.987 --> 03:43:00.051]  The radio stations may still choose to run their commercial breaks, but on InfoWars.com and Van.Video, the live streams will continue without interruption.
[03:43:01.371 --> 03:43:03.513]  Here's some breaking updated news.
[03:43:03.513 --> 03:43:07.797]  MSNBC says the person shot on the Capitol grounds is in critical condition.
[03:43:07.797 --> 03:43:13.561]  Five others, including a law enforcement officer, have also been sent to a hospital.
[03:43:13.561 --> 03:43:16.044]  The entire National Guard in Washington, D.C.
[03:43:16.044 --> 03:43:17.585]  has been activated.
[03:43:17.585 --> 03:43:23.050]  This is unconfirmed, but it does say that protesters are engaging U.S.
[03:43:23.050 --> 03:43:25.772]  Secret Service hand-to-hand combat.
[03:43:28.307 --> 03:43:28.947]  Unconfirmed.
[03:43:28.947 --> 03:43:32.270]  I'm not sure if that's a troll post or not.
[03:43:32.270 --> 03:43:36.533]  Mike Pence has said the violence and destruction taking place the US Capitol must stop and it must stop now.
[03:43:36.533 --> 03:43:40.456]  Anybody involved must respect law enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.
[03:43:40.456 --> 03:43:49.823]  This attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[03:43:49.823 --> 03:43:51.884]  Absolutely incredible stuff.
[03:43:52.802 --> 03:43:56.386]  Akeem Jeffries says members plan to return and certify the Electoral College.
[03:43:56.386 --> 03:44:03.074]  Members from both parties applaud, but first they're still clearing the Capitol.
[03:44:03.074 --> 03:44:05.056]  The media is calling the riot an insurrection.
[03:44:07.586 --> 03:44:09.769]  Wouldn't it be amazing to be a Democrat?
[03:44:09.769 --> 03:44:23.327]  Wouldn't it just be absolutely amazing if we were the mainstream media and we could sit here with all of this going on, with people being shot, with the Capitol building broken into and we could just sit here and go, well a small peaceful gathering of Trump supporters.
[03:44:23.968 --> 03:44:25.149]  occurred earlier today.
[03:44:25.149 --> 03:44:27.010]  It was nothing really to see.
[03:44:27.010 --> 03:44:28.270]  No one was hurt.
[03:44:28.270 --> 03:44:29.291]  Nothing really happened.
[03:44:29.291 --> 03:44:33.693]  It was just regular Americans expressing their right to protest.
[03:44:33.693 --> 03:44:46.399]  And if you dare to oppose this and all of this talk of sending in the National Guard is clear evidence of tyranny and, you know, the fascism that is slowly gripping our entire country.
[03:44:46.399 --> 03:44:53.082]  And if you don't support this, you are a racist and you want innocent people to be murdered by police.
[03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:57.285]  We don't have the luxury of being able to ignore reality here.
[03:44:57.285 --> 03:45:03.273]  We have to face it as it comes and so we're bringing you everything that we hear and see up to date.
[03:45:05.047 --> 03:45:13.676]  The Washington State Capitol building in Olympia, Washington also has a large crowd gathered outside of it with people saying, quote, we go down swinging.
[03:45:13.676 --> 03:45:27.229]  And again, the media, after having ignored a year's worth of writing, after having downplayed the violence, the destruction, the chaos that has been wrought on the American people for the better part of a year,
[03:45:28.030 --> 03:45:37.902]  As decent Americans were shut down, locked down, imprisoned in their own homes, and forced to shut down their businesses for the sake of COVID-19.
[03:45:37.902 --> 03:45:41.206]  And we're told the riots were not riots, they were protests.
[03:45:41.206 --> 03:45:44.469]  The destruction wasn't destruction, it was speech.
[03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:45.971]  And now after
[03:45:47.452 --> 03:45:51.973]  Less than two hours of pushback from the right.
[03:45:51.973 --> 03:45:53.593]  They're calling it an insurrection.
[03:45:53.593 --> 03:45:55.574]  They're calling in the National Guard.
[03:45:55.574 --> 03:45:59.934]  They're advocating for every one of the protesters to be shot.
[03:45:59.934 --> 03:46:03.435]  And they are freaking out completely.
[03:46:03.435 --> 03:46:05.095]  I guess this was to be expected.
[03:46:05.095 --> 03:46:08.536]  Now again, we've had a bird's eye view of all of this.
[03:46:08.536 --> 03:46:13.997]  And now they're saying from Zero Hedge, explosive device found at RNC.
[03:46:13.997 --> 03:46:15.417]  DNC has been evacuated.
[03:46:18.393 --> 03:46:29.203]  Not sure where those exactly are, if those are parts of the Capitol building, or if those are nearby buildings.
[03:46:29.203 --> 03:46:30.624]  At least one woman has been shot.
[03:46:30.624 --> 03:46:33.486]  She's fighting for her life in critical condition.
[03:46:33.486 --> 03:46:39.792]  The video of that firing, which we played on air not too long ago, has been expunged from Twitter.
[03:46:39.792 --> 03:46:44.396]  Twitter has hidden the account that posted it, and the video itself has been taken down.
[03:46:46.152 --> 03:46:53.176]  They're saying a reporter is having a panic attack because they're locked in the Capitol without any police protection and we hear and feel rumblings underneath us.
[03:46:53.176 --> 03:47:05.344]  This is scary, folks, especially after being labeled the enemy for some four years.
[03:47:05.344 --> 03:47:06.305]  We'll keep bringing you updates here.
[03:47:06.305 --> 03:47:07.385]  This is InfoWars.com.
[03:47:07.385 --> 03:47:09.887]  We're going commercial-free completely.
[03:47:10.948 --> 03:47:15.311]  Uh, by the way, more people, uh, posting and tagging me in these types of posts.
[03:47:15.311 --> 03:47:18.633]  Remember when Dems were allowed to protest inside the Rotunda?
[03:47:18.633 --> 03:47:21.355]  Then one of them cornered Jeff Flake in an elevator.
[03:47:21.355 --> 03:47:23.457]  Yeah, good times.
[03:47:23.457 --> 03:47:24.297]  Right?
[03:47:24.297 --> 03:47:25.618]  Say, our vote, our turn.
[03:47:25.618 --> 03:47:26.879]  Hashtag, our vote, our turn.
[03:47:31.505 --> 03:47:45.477]  More protesters breaking into congressional offices, senatorial offices, and destroying or taking information and hard drives.
[03:47:45.477 --> 03:47:49.640]  It looks like this video of the woman being shot is being re-uploaded.
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:56.426]  As far as I can tell, it looks like she was shot through the door.
[03:47:56.426 --> 03:47:59.108]  It looks like she was shot through the window.
[03:48:00.908 --> 03:48:01.428]  of that door.
[03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:19.173]  Owen is live right now and we have him.
[03:48:19.173 --> 03:48:22.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is live on the scene.
[03:48:22.576 --> 03:48:24.398]  Sirens behind us.
[03:48:24.398 --> 03:48:25.699]  Flares have been shot in the air.
[03:48:25.699 --> 03:48:26.840]  The Capitol has been breached.
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:30.824]  A lady has been shot by Capitol Police.
[03:48:30.824 --> 03:48:33.306]  This is just history in the making.
[03:48:33.306 --> 03:48:40.012]  Quite frankly, this lady getting shot is only going to make people even madder because it's just going to show the double standard again.
[03:48:40.996 --> 03:48:44.752]  It's just going to show the double standard again that we have to witness so much here.
[03:48:45.646 --> 03:48:50.410]  Which is, uh, two billion dollars in property damage this summer.
[03:48:50.410 --> 03:48:52.191]  No arrests, no one held accountable.
[03:48:52.191 --> 03:48:57.175]  Oh, but we go into the Capitol and the lady gets shot, nobody will even know her name.
[03:48:57.175 --> 03:49:02.800]  But if somebody overdoses on fentanyl in Milwaukee, it causes two billion dollars in property damage.
[03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:05.542]  Uh, we're still getting intel, people are still outside the Capitol.
[03:49:05.542 --> 03:49:07.984]  This is a developing story and a developing situation.
[03:49:07.984 --> 03:49:10.386]  A turning point, perhaps, in U.S.
[03:49:10.386 --> 03:49:12.348]  history and in world history.
[03:49:12.348 --> 03:49:13.508]  And I'm not even sure
[03:49:14.489 --> 03:49:16.811]  Uh, how to even describe this.
[03:49:16.811 --> 03:49:22.535]  I think the images and the story... Look, there's a communist Chinese takeover with the New World Order of the country.
[03:49:22.535 --> 03:49:23.615]  They're trying to steal the election.
[03:49:23.615 --> 03:49:25.176]  They're trying to bankrupt the nation.
[03:49:25.176 --> 03:49:26.897]  They're telling us the country shouldn't even exist.
[03:49:26.897 --> 03:49:28.939]  They're telling us the word mother and father can't exist.
[03:49:28.939 --> 03:49:30.740]  This is a communist takeover.
[03:49:30.740 --> 03:49:33.442]  And everybody knows it, and so America's starting to push back.
[03:49:34.182 --> 03:49:38.325]  And ZGPing, and everybody else needs to know, you're the ones starting all this, not us.
[03:49:38.325 --> 03:49:42.268]  And you're the ones that are going to pay, just like Hitler, and just like all the rest of the scumbags.
[03:49:42.268 --> 03:49:44.369]  And you know, this is what happens.
[03:49:44.369 --> 03:49:45.610]  This is the result.
[03:49:45.610 --> 03:49:52.095]  This is like, if you don't deal with a cancer, and you have cancer, and you don't deal with it until it's too late, they basically only have one shot.
[03:49:52.395 --> 03:49:56.897]  And that's just a chemotherapy, radiate the hell out of you, and then hope you can survive.
[03:49:56.897 --> 03:49:58.198]  That's what we're going through.
[03:49:58.198 --> 03:50:01.339]  We've had a cancer in this country for decades.
[03:50:01.339 --> 03:50:04.380]  We've had a communist Chinese takeover for decades.
[03:50:04.380 --> 03:50:08.602]  We've been occupied by tyrants for decades, and we've been ignoring it.
[03:50:08.602 --> 03:50:13.064]  And that's why we've had a background at the show the last week of the Capitol with red clouds going over it.
[03:50:13.064 --> 03:50:17.506]  We should put that background up because there it is, folks, a foreign takeover of our country.
[03:50:18.106 --> 03:50:20.969]  That was so powerful, successful, because it was freer than other nations.
[03:50:20.969 --> 03:50:23.872]  The freedom is what makes us have money and be prosperous.
[03:50:23.872 --> 03:50:27.055]  And now it's draining out, it's like all the blue cities and all the blue states.
[03:50:27.055 --> 03:50:29.958]  So, more of our crew got here, we got more of our better equipment.
[03:50:29.958 --> 03:50:32.060]  We're going to reconnoiter some of that before we start the fourth hour.
[03:50:32.060 --> 03:50:37.646]  We're going to hand this back over to Harrison Smith, but we'll be back co-hosting in the fourth hour to say great job to the crew.
[03:50:39.704 --> 03:50:39.784]  Yeah.
[03:50:54.941 --> 03:51:01.684]  The National Guard and a bunch of police men, they've already been throwing flashbangs at the crowds to attack those peaceful patriots down there.
[03:51:01.684 --> 03:51:03.825]  And myself, my wife, the crew was all just down there.
[03:51:03.825 --> 03:51:06.946]  My wife got cut off from us and was down there and just got back.
[03:51:06.946 --> 03:51:08.446]  There's families with children.
[03:51:08.446 --> 03:51:12.008]  And now I talk to folks in contact with the Capitol Police.
[03:51:12.987 --> 03:51:14.868]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:51:14.868 --> 03:51:22.371]  There's photos of this, we're getting it right now, of the Capitol Police officer, or security guard, shooting a woman in the neck.
[03:51:22.371 --> 03:51:24.671]  So this is like V for Vendetta type stuff.
[03:51:24.671 --> 03:51:25.912]  This is the real world.
[03:51:25.912 --> 03:51:31.794]  And we're going to get all those images, we're going to get them up on stream for you at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:51:31.794 --> 03:51:37.997]  But take the live streams of the feeds at Band.Video of this show, and the live show feed, and share it with everyone you know.
[03:51:37.997 --> 03:51:40.117]  And local radio stations, tell folks to tune in.
[03:51:40.117 --> 03:51:41.058]  Some radio stations
[03:51:41.932 --> 03:51:43.072]  Are breaking away.
[03:51:43.072 --> 03:51:47.013]  You'll just hear us talk, and they'll go to commercial, because we're not playing music.
[03:51:47.013 --> 03:51:48.913]  It just hard cuts their commercial.
[03:51:48.913 --> 03:51:50.033]  They're not censoring anything.
[03:51:50.033 --> 03:51:51.714]  That's how the satellites are programmed.
[03:51:51.714 --> 03:51:52.914]  A lot of our stations are robot.
[03:51:52.914 --> 03:51:55.514]  They don't have anybody at the controls all the time.
[03:51:55.514 --> 03:51:57.155]  So the stations are doing a great job.
[03:51:57.155 --> 03:52:01.776]  We're going commercial street three on our streams at Infowars.com, band.video.
[03:52:01.776 --> 03:52:06.576]  And of course, theresistance.video is the new URL to share what's not being censored as bad.
[03:52:06.576 --> 03:52:07.737]  Harrison Smith, take back over.
[03:52:07.737 --> 03:52:09.537]  We're going to get set back up and come back.
[03:52:10.618 --> 03:52:14.060]  Things are so crazy, I'm not even sure of what... It's the War Room right now, it's about to start.
[03:52:14.060 --> 03:52:16.681]  Okay, so the War Room starts in two minutes.
[03:52:16.681 --> 03:52:19.762]  It's the same feeds, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:52:19.762 --> 03:52:25.004]  Everybody tune over to the War Room, same show, same host, Harrison Smith, Tom Papert and others coming up.
[03:52:25.004 --> 03:52:25.945]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:52:27.455 --> 03:52:28.596]  Alright, welcome back folks.
[03:52:28.596 --> 03:52:34.921]  No commercial breaks for us as we continue to monitor this incredible situation.
[03:52:34.921 --> 03:52:42.187]  We are hearing that the Maryland National Guard is being sent to DC.
[03:52:42.187 --> 03:52:47.871]  We're seeing, oh interesting, people are now looking into some of the
[03:52:49.943 --> 03:52:58.847]  People that have broken in, they're seeing tattoos that look suspiciously like communist things.
[03:52:58.847 --> 03:53:08.611]  We're seeing these incredible shots from inside the Capitol Dome, from BG on the scene, who as always is providing incredible video from this.
[03:53:08.611 --> 03:53:12.493]  We're hearing the FBI is being deployed, we're hearing that the
[03:53:14.972 --> 03:53:24.445]  Uh, National Guard is being deployed from DC, Maryland and elsewhere.
[03:53:24.445 --> 03:53:26.828]  And we're seeing Middle East.
[03:53:27.907 --> 03:53:29.909]  Media covering the storming of the U.S.
[03:53:29.909 --> 03:53:35.214]  Capitol, which is, I guess, a change of fate here.
[03:53:35.214 --> 03:53:40.719]  And so we'll be starting the War Room in just 10 seconds on Infowars.com and banned.
[03:53:40.719 --> 03:53:41.760]  Video commercial free.
[03:53:41.760 --> 03:53:43.441]  The War Room continues the next three hours.
[03:53:43.441 --> 03:53:44.942]  We'll continue to cover this.
[03:53:44.942 --> 03:53:45.423]  Stay with us.
