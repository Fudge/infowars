[00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:13.784]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:15.565]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.446]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:19.167]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.828]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:25.511]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:40.801]  Back in May of 2021, Austin, Texas voted on Proposition B, which made it illegal for the growing number of homeless flocking to Austin to camp anywhere they please.
[00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:49.388]  The vote was 57% in favor and 42% against, according to the Travis County Clerk's office election data.
[00:00:53.849 --> 00:01:03.961]  People have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces where their actions, content, and possessions can be seen or conversations heard.
[00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.986]  Again, whether the content at issue is physical or virtual.
[00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:13.713]  Examples of such places are public sidewalks, venues hosting sporting events, and public parks.
[00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:19.199]  There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in discarded garbage left in the street.
[00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:30.811]  The homeless had been promised permanent housing from the council, which never materialized even after millions were cut from much-needed public safety and diverted towards housing the homeless.
[00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:41.797]  When the day arrived for Proposition B to be enforced, the first area targeted was City Hall, which had fallen under siege by what appeared to be the homeless, but that was an illusion.
[00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:52.143]  I had been informed by the defunded Austin Police Department that they were well aware that the people now shouting threats and racist diatribes in their faces weren't homeless.
[00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:54.004]  The majority of them were activists.
[00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:58.169]  I issued a criminal trespass warning for the people around us in Joplin.
[00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:59.470]  That was 11 tips.
[00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.917]  Listen, we were being extraordinary, asking for voluntary compliance to not block buildings, right?
[00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.939]  So we moved the 11 tips over there.
[00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.264]  So listen, this endeavor is separate and distinct from saying, hey, I'm just doing education outreach.
[00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:13.726]  That's a courtesy.
[00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:14.687]  This has never been legal.
[00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:24.411]  The reality is that the liberal activist group Homes Not Handcuffs had organized the siege in protest of the will of the Austin voters.
[00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:33.275]  Supporting that protest was the majority of the now absent city council and other wealthy Democrats hell-bent on turning Texas blue.
[00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:37.837]  Again, manipulating the legitimate vote and will of the Austin voters.
[00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:46.722]  And per usual, the local police would have to endure the task of playing the role of the bad guy while enforcing the people's vote.
[00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:55.067]  To make matters more undemocratic and totalitarian, the organization behind Homes Not Handcuffs is ActBlue.
[00:02:55.507 --> 00:03:12.877]  The insidious George Soros tax-exempt political organization, an organization where billionaires dump money into pseudo grassroots movements designed to throw a wrench in federal, state, and local government foolish enough to allow the minions of Soros's lies to fester.
[00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:20.283]  Act Blue was once described in a human rights article as, quote, not driven by the average Democrat.
[00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:28.491]  As their image may suggest, they are rather mouthpieces for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor unions.
[00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.593]  You really need to bring China
[00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.638]  George Soros has been a controversial topic.
[00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:42.680]  His past is well known and his enemies are many.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:57.990]  But after the media defended his public image recently, he had fallen off the radar, which gave Soros and those that would dismantle the United States enough time and cover to reinforce their radical activism infesting major U.S.
[00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.330]  cities.
[00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:06.355]  It became accepted common knowledge, and although it is completely antithetical to the survival of our Republic, U.S.
[00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:12.439]  politicians have done relatively nothing to stop it, and it's been ignored by media as it grew.
[00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.401]  A message to the fools surrounding City Hall.
[00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.865]  The majority of you aren't even from Austin, much less Texas.
[00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:23.327]  Your blatant insult masquerading as a protest
[00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:32.471]  Has only caused the tax-paying residents of the city of Austin to become increasingly infuriated and your cover has been blown.
[00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:38.833]  You'll be lucky if we don't find a way to put all of you behind bars for meddling in the results of our local ballots.
[00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:43.535]  As for the residents of Austin, Texas, this is no conspiracy theory.
[00:04:43.535 --> 00:04:45.476]  It is easily verifiable.
[00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:49.937]  George Soros and his employees have laid siege to your city hall.
[00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:51.058]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:56.598]  And the reason this is so important is it's the same here and in Europe and around the world.
[00:04:56.598 --> 00:04:58.159]  It's all part of the larger criminal takeover.
[00:05:00.402 --> 00:05:09.388]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.
[00:05:09.388 --> 00:05:13.471]  BioTrue Selenium is the highest quality selenium from the mustard seed.
[00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.653]  It is essential for all cellular activity in the body.
[00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:18.734]  It's critical and it funds the info war.
[00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:19.795]  It's back in stock.
[00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:21.456]  Then we have Ultimate Krill Oil.
[00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:22.937]  Highest grade of krill oil.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.361]  It's back in stock.
[00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:32.243]  And by the way, all these are discounted 40 to 50% off.
[00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:35.084]  But then, one more other great item is now back in stock.

[00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:47.788]  The other products are 50% off and 40% off.
[00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:49.869]  Check them out today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.750]  The trifecta of InfoWars products.
[00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.550]  Bio-Trisillinium,
[00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.171]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:57.194]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:27.176]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, June 18th.
[00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:28.618]  Transmission.
[00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:32.842]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:39.149]  And then the war room with Owen Schroyer takes over right here on the Embattled Info Wars Radio slash TV network.
[00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:56.588]  We also have a constitutional lawyer who represents quite a few of the victims that are being set up by the criminal deep state from the January 6th event who were not violent and who were allowed into the Capitol building by the police who are in solitary confinement.
[00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:58.569]  That lawyer will be joining us coming up.
[00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:11.193]  At the start of the next hour, then Max Keiser is going to pop in with an inflation update in the last segment or so of the third hour, but I also intend to open the phones up today.
[00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:24.845]  Then tomorrow, I will announce by the end of the show who's going to be on the special, but we're going to have a raft of guests and witnesses and insiders and whistleblowers on tomorrow
[00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:30.154]  And we're going to be taping this special transmission today and tomorrow.
[00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:47.945]  So it'll take to air and it will be airing exposing the true false flag that was January 6th and how out of that they plan to launch this total takeover of society and civilization of a martial law crackdown the likes of which this country has ever seen in the near future.
[00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:55.389]  So exposing this as Tucker Carlson and others are doing right now is absolutely essential to all of our freedoms because
[00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:04.599]  The globalists want a police state in place to destroy the middle class, collapse the economy and consolidate absolute total control.
[00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:11.706]  They're trying to put that police state system in place and turn the entire anti-terrorism apparatus on the American people.
[00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:15.946]  And that's being admitted in mainline publications.
[00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:27.589]  They're saying, we want to arrest all political opposition, we want to make it illegal to not let us sexualize your children, and illegal to not let us teach your children that they're bad because they're white.
[00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:38.851]  This is just a extremely toxic, extremely criminal, extremely out of control, poisonous, cancerous, malignant system they're building.
[00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.492]  I mean, here's even mainstream news headlines.
[00:08:42.185 --> 00:08:45.227]  A sea change in counter-terrorism.
[00:08:45.227 --> 00:08:55.853]  And then you read on, it says, no longer is it for radical Islam, it is for gun-owning, Bible-believing, pro-life Christians.
[00:08:55.853 --> 00:09:01.296]  An open declaration of war against the American people.
[00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:10.221]  And we heard all this from Biden, and we heard it from Psaki, and we heard it from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we heard it from the Secretary of Defense, and we heard it from the FBI, and we heard it from the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:17.217]  For they said, arrest people that disagree with our views.
[00:09:17.217 --> 00:09:25.103]  Sacha Baron Cohen called for my arrest, because I question a lot of big public events.
[00:09:25.103 --> 00:09:35.832]  I mean, when you hear that on the ADL's main stage, on their national conference, and it's put on C-SPAN, they mean business.
[00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:36.773]  They mean business.
[00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:45.962]  I played that former Deputy Assistant FBI Director clip a few times last week where he said, Oh, I know this is really making you sick to your stomach.
[00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:51.387]  This is really scary, but we've got to go ahead and take out members of Congress.
[00:09:51.387 --> 00:09:56.492]  They're the command and control of the terrorism and of the cult.
[00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:57.033]  Think about that.
[00:09:58.704 --> 00:10:03.367]  Those are not just fighting words, those are what an authoritarian state does.
[00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:17.097]  Because they're illegitimate, and they stole the election, and they know they did, and they've got a bunch of yes-men and women that'll do whatever they're told, a bunch of reality winners, and instead of being in jail, are running the country.
[00:10:17.097 --> 00:10:24.703]  And they intend to make their move, because they know the country's awake, the world's waking up, there's gonna be a giant landslide for good Republican candidates,
[00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:29.506]  They know the election fraud, they are so scared right now, is just mounting.
[00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:36.108]  The evidence is all documented from those six key states where the polls closed and Trump has had record high victory.
[00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:42.630]  And then by the end of the night, by the next morning, suddenly all these magic ballots have been found.
[00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.072]  All of this is coming out.
[00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:53.674]  And so when you can't maintain control of the propaganda, you maintain control through domination and through outlawing your opposition.
[00:10:54.702 --> 00:10:58.744]  And so, mainstream media is in free fall.
[00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:06.349]  No one trusts them, no one believes them, but a very small handful of echo chamber individuals that are on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:21.177]  But almost everybody else now sees what's happening, so the globalists are going to try to launch terror attacks, to frame their political opposition, to then be able to intimidate everybody else and say, hey, if you don't want to be arrested, shut up.
[00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:30.017]  Because we'll set you up like Alex Jones or Matt Gaetz or so many other people they're trying to set up right now.
[00:11:30.017 --> 00:11:34.080]  And they're going after President Trump, who they know is about to start his rallies back.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.681]  In fact, he already has started them.
[00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:37.682]  And so we're not backing down.
[00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:38.302]  We're not going away.
[00:11:38.302 --> 00:11:39.883]  But let me go ahead and make this big announcement here.
[00:11:39.883 --> 00:11:41.505]  It'll make the left extremely happy.
[00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:44.226]  But they already know this is all going on.
[00:11:44.226 --> 00:11:51.151]  The reason the last two weeks Alex Jones has trended number one and number five and number ten and number one in politics on Twitter and other places is
[00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:55.461]  The left went and edited videos of my show.
[00:11:55.461 --> 00:11:57.222]  It's not like they're secret.
[00:11:57.222 --> 00:12:07.310]  And they go, here's Jones admitting to coordinating the January 6th insurrection, as they call it, and here he is admitting he did it.
[00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:16.516]  When, of course, it was me talking about us helping organize the Ellipse and that event and the other peaceful events that happened in the months before that and all the other peaceful events.
[00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:21.200]  But they put it out there and gaslight people to try to give cover to the Justice Department
[00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:28.433]  And one of the conspirators, the original Oklahoma City attack, Garland, to indict me.
[00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:35.858]  And we've confirmed from a lot of individuals that they've been approached by the FBI and told, just tell us about Alex Jones and we won't indict you.
[00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:39.900]  Just tell us that Alex Jones planned all this.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.462]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.543]  I never did that.
[00:12:43.543 --> 00:12:50.187]  And so whoever says that or whoever claims that is a liar and has done so under duress and no one is going to buy that.
[00:12:52.242 --> 00:12:58.464]  So instead, they will simply try to set me up for something else.
[00:12:58.464 --> 00:13:06.588]  So if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a heroin needle in my arm, I don't go to hookers in hotel rooms and I don't take heroin or any other drugs.
[00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:10.369]  If they say I committed suicide, I didn't do that.
[00:13:10.369 --> 00:13:17.052]  Their favorite thing is to kill your whole family with you so you're demonized when they announce you killed yourself and your family, or your family and yourself.
[00:13:17.052 --> 00:13:17.792]  I would never do that.
[00:13:17.792 --> 00:13:19.293]  That's a classic Deep State action.
[00:13:19.293 --> 00:13:20.233]  If that happens, they did it.
[00:13:21.198 --> 00:13:29.626]  If that happens, you can bet it was directed by the FBI Director and by the Attorney General, who are nothing but terrorists that work for the globalists.
[00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:32.508]  And so we're in that area now here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:32.508 --> 00:13:35.871]  I've told Tucker Carlson, they're coming after you and your family.
[00:13:35.871 --> 00:13:38.693]  And, you know, you've seen his response.
[00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:39.654]  He knows what's going on.
[00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:42.677]  He's fighting hard for this country.
[00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:45.239]  And I would suggest everybody else does the same.
[00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:46.000]  When they're done,
[00:13:46.832 --> 00:13:56.520]  They don't have Frank Figliusi, or whatever his name is, on TV saying, we're going to use counter-terrorism operations against Congress for no reason.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.966]  They want to have a hot coup where they decapitate Senator Hawley, Senator Cruz, Senator Paul.
[00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:04.747]  They already tried to kill repeatedly.
[00:14:04.747 --> 00:14:11.273]  Just like they tried to send their operative in to kill the conservative caucus at that baseball game that was a successful shooting.
[00:14:11.273 --> 00:14:13.434]  Only, thank God, one of the congressmen.
[00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:15.196]  And that's because they had security there.
[00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:23.079]  And so these guys, 110% are on TV saying, we need to use counter-terrorism operations to take out Congress.
[00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:28.583]  So anytime Republicans are together alone, they've got to be very careful.
[00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.245]  Everybody's got to increase their security.
[00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:35.429]  That is a prominent pro-America person that's not a traitor, because this is a foreign multinational coup.
[00:14:36.378 --> 00:14:43.643]  This is a takeover and they're announcing it everywhere to embolden their criminal networks inside the FBI, inside the CIA.
[00:14:43.643 --> 00:14:45.044]  I want to be clear.
[00:14:45.044 --> 00:14:50.088]  The entire CIA, the entire FBI, the entire Justice Department is not criminals.
[00:14:50.088 --> 00:15:01.716]  But at the top, it is a very sick, evil group of America-hating lawyers who have already sold the country out and who know they're all going to prison when their son of the country comes out.
[00:15:01.716 --> 00:15:04.598]  So they were willing to spy on candidate Trump, spy on
[00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:08.657]  President Trump, we told you all that.
[00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.538]  And now they know they're painted into a corner.
[00:15:10.538 --> 00:15:13.659]  So they're going to want to stage terror attacks, really big ones.
[00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:24.144]  And then during the smokescreen of that, take out the American leadership, which includes, of course, President Trump, who is now you see coming out saying young people don't need the vaccine.
[00:15:24.144 --> 00:15:27.265]  And he's got questions about the vaccine and Fauci now.
[00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:33.108]  Trump is doing the right thing moving towards exposing the entire deal and extricating himself from that because he didn't do it on purpose.
[00:15:33.108 --> 00:15:33.748]  So we forgive him.
[00:15:34.654 --> 00:15:35.934]  So this is do or die.
[00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:39.555]  This is absolute either end of the republic or rebirth of the republic.
[00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:43.316]  This is an incredible, incredible time.
[00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:48.577]  But that's where we are as a society and somebody's got to stand up to these criminals and call them out.
[00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:49.717]  These are not government officials.
[00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.978]  These are foreign, globalist agents.
[00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:53.198]  These are traitors.
[00:15:53.198 --> 00:16:02.120]  These are criminals who want to bring the country down and gut it and they're coming for you and your family.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.400]  Your voice counts.
[00:16:04.193 --> 00:16:09.255]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:11.836]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:13.337]  They know you're angry.
[00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:18.739]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever to use every tool we've got.

[00:17:03.895 --> 00:17:05.076]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:05.876]  Granny Do-Right.
[00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:06.817]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:07.517]  Go ahead.
[00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:08.058]  Hey, Alex.
[00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:10.659]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[00:17:10.659 --> 00:17:21.366]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:27.369]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.390]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:38.376]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[00:17:38.376 --> 00:17:47.142]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[00:17:47.142 --> 00:17:47.962]  This is working.
[00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:48.963]  This is wonderful.
[00:17:48.963 --> 00:17:53.486]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know?
[00:17:53.486 --> 00:17:58.129]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.343]  The equation is very simple.
[00:18:03.343 --> 00:18:12.920]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:23.183]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[00:18:23.183 --> 00:18:31.668]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[00:18:31.668 --> 00:18:38.451]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside down, and use
[00:18:39.271 --> 00:18:47.353]  The idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[00:18:47.353 --> 00:18:51.854]  That's why they target Infowars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[00:18:51.854 --> 00:18:57.235]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote Infowars and ban that video.
[00:18:57.235 --> 00:18:58.195]  So redouble your efforts.
[00:18:58.195 --> 00:19:03.296]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:03.296 --> 00:19:05.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:19.022 --> 00:19:27.327]  God didn't put me in this position, at this point, to pull any punches.
[00:19:27.327 --> 00:19:34.931]  In fact, I intend to accelerate everything we're doing to the next level.
[00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:40.855]  But I do call on the power of Christ and the Holy Spirit to lead God and direct me.
[00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:48.112]  And I call on you to pray for me, and to pray for President Trump and Tucker Carlson and others.
[00:19:48.112 --> 00:19:56.436]  Because Trump's not backing down, I'm not backing down, Carlson's not backing down, and nobody else I know is backing down, including those members of Congress.
[00:19:56.436 --> 00:20:08.601]  And that's why, get ready with Figliosi please, that's why they've got these monsters on television, very threateningly, menacing Congress, saying we need to take out Congress.
[00:20:10.106 --> 00:20:11.968]  I don't think we should take out Democrats.
[00:20:11.968 --> 00:20:15.230]  I don't think we should take out Chuckie Schumer.
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:20.654]  If I'd have been saying that, and I'd have been there on January, they should indict me.
[00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:22.456]  That is a overthrow.
[00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:23.997]  That is an attempt to overthrow.
[00:20:23.997 --> 00:20:25.578]  I think he should be indicted for his crimes.
[00:20:25.578 --> 00:20:27.039]  A jury should try him.
[00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:27.980]  Not he should be killed.
[00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:37.582]  But they're in the news saying we're going to use counter-terrorism on the networks of Trump support and those that question elections, when that's our right to question those elections.
[00:20:37.582 --> 00:20:39.484]  And you're the ones that are terrorists.
[00:20:39.484 --> 00:20:41.605]  And you're the ones that are terrorizing people.
[00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:44.007]  And somebody's got to call your bluff.
[00:20:44.007 --> 00:20:49.491]  Or, if it's not a bluff, everybody's going to see Alex Jones get set up or killed.
[00:20:49.491 --> 00:20:53.114]  That's just the way the ball bounces.
[00:20:53.114 --> 00:20:54.675]  And I am completely comfortable with that.
[00:20:56.266 --> 00:20:59.628]  But one way or the other, you're getting called out for what you've done.
[00:20:59.628 --> 00:21:05.831]  Keep pushing it, and pushing it, and pushing it, and somebody's got to stand up against your ass.
[00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:25.122]  And my main mission is to get other people to stand up in City Hall, and in police departments, and in the state houses, and in the churches, and in the businesses, and in the farms, and in the ranches, and in the factories, and in the mountains, and in the valleys, and on the ocean, and on the lakes, and the streams, and the rivers of this country.
[00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:35.696]  Because to quote Winston Churchill, we will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, and we will never surrender.
[00:21:35.696 --> 00:21:39.422]  Because that's a drug better than anything I ever felt in my life, being on the side of right.
[00:21:40.222 --> 00:21:58.419]  They're not bound to evil and not bound to a bunch of cowards and a bunch of scum lawyers that have been all over boardrooms hyping themselves up how tough they are and how badass they are and how they're gonna whip those Americans and teach those Midwesterners and teach those Texans and teach those people that are hard-working that they're scum and we're under your thumb!
[00:21:58.419 --> 00:22:03.123]  No, we're not under your thumb!
[00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:06.006]  You run this country in the ground, you sold this nation out!
[00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:10.974]  And you let the perverts that run San Francisco take control of our schools.
[00:22:10.974 --> 00:22:18.058]  I'm ashamed we haven't done more to oppose you!
[00:22:18.058 --> 00:22:25.022]  Here's one of their spokespersons, just like Phil Mudd of the CIA, on TV saying, oh, we're going to kill Trump, and we're going to kill them.
[00:22:25.022 --> 00:22:29.924]  And you already, oh yeah, break the ribs of Rand Paul and shoot Scalise.
[00:22:29.924 --> 00:22:31.545]  Too bad they didn't shoot more.
[00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:33.506]  You're the ones who want conflict.
[00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:34.607]  You're the ones who want to fight.
[00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:39.017]  You're the ones that have to steal the election.
[00:22:39.017 --> 00:22:43.180]  Because you know we're rejecting your slimy asses.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.042]  Here's another one of these enemies of America.
[00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:52.439]  What cult should we follow?
[00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:54.200]  The one where we give five-year-olds drag queen story time?
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.301]  Or the one where we shoot people up with poisonous vaccines, the Bill Gates cult?
[00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:22.356]  Or the Open Border Cult?
[00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:25.159]  Or the Shut Down the Churches Cult?
[00:23:25.159 --> 00:23:26.800]  Or the Bankrupt the Treasury Cult?
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.383]  Or the Sell Out the Chi Comps Cult?
[00:23:29.383 --> 00:23:32.126]  Because you know, the cult you're offering ain't too cool, man.
[00:23:32.126 --> 00:23:35.430]  We like to want to be good, strong Americans and coming together and being happy.
[00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.015]  And you love radical Islam and every other dirty, horrible, out-of-control thing.
[00:23:40.015 --> 00:23:42.758]  And you call us a cult because we won't back down to you?
[00:23:44.634 --> 00:23:54.397]  We came to peacefully protest an event, and you roped in a tiny fraction of a million people to break in the Capitol, so you call us all terrorists, so you can now say, let's go after members of Congress?
[00:23:54.397 --> 00:23:59.159]  And I've got a bunch of more videos of other people saying it!
[00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:02.580]  They're gonna make their move, because they've never gotten in trouble.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.381]  What always takes over a third world country?
[00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:12.343]  What always made Rome in its last 300 years constantly be unstable?
[00:24:14.594 --> 00:24:16.375]  The Petroleum Guard.
[00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:20.616]  The Federal Police.
[00:24:20.616 --> 00:24:34.920]  The fall of any republic is when its bureaucracy and its armed men at the top, in control of their corrupt courts, decide to take over.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.120]  That's how you become a North Korea.
[00:24:36.827 --> 00:25:00.317]  So they become a communist China, Nazi Germany, and we're following the exact steps directly into that with them saying, officially out of the FBI Justice Department, Merrick Garland, that 65% of the population, half of them above 65, old people, are white supremacists.
[00:25:00.317 --> 00:25:03.658]  So they can be targeted as the enemy.
[00:25:03.658 --> 00:25:05.759]  This is out of some hunchbacked lawyer.
[00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:08.143]  With a huge criminal history.
[00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:14.148]  We're all supposed to fall down before him and do whatever he says as the media covers up all the black-on-white crime.
[00:25:14.148 --> 00:25:19.131]  Exploding with the black killers saying they did it because whites deserve it.
[00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:20.672]  Because whites are killing them.
[00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:23.595]  And as Tucker Carlson said, who can blame them?
[00:25:23.595 --> 00:25:29.879]  You start getting every channel in the country saying that a certain group's bad, other groups are gonna start killing them.
[00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:32.381]  You know, Hitler did that.
[00:25:32.381 --> 00:25:34.743]  Attorney General, General Garland.
[00:25:37.293 --> 00:25:44.015]  Who sold out to all these foreign banks and Apple Computer with its slave camps and all the corruption they're involved in.
[00:25:44.015 --> 00:25:48.596]  And then they want to rearguard action while they loot the country of having black and white kill each other.
[00:25:48.596 --> 00:25:53.478]  And then you point at the conservative nationalist movement trying to bring America together.
[00:25:53.478 --> 00:25:58.079]  At President Trump that you deposed in fraud in your electoral coup.
[00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:12.758]  Your fraud coup that he wants division when he did the exact opposite in every poll so you spewed all the poison you could to create division.
[00:26:12.758 --> 00:26:13.479]  So that's where we are.
[00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:23.426]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and finish up with this and I've got huge news on the just incredible vaccine death news and more.
[00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:27.249]  Please remember, whatever happens to me, InfoWars is designed to continue on.

[00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:35.385]  But we need capital to do that and we don't need to be running on E in the middle of a major attack like this.
[00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:39.748]  We need to have fuel and that's money and energy to be able to do a lot of things.
[00:26:39.748 --> 00:26:40.829]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:48.394]  That are legal and lawful to help us continue on into the future no matter what happens to this operation.
[00:26:48.394 --> 00:26:49.655]  That is my main mission.

[00:29:03.886 --> 00:29:06.528]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:17.474]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth, out of 7.5 billion, have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[00:29:17.474 --> 00:29:21.716]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[00:29:21.716 --> 00:29:26.799]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.540]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.123]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[00:29:34.123 --> 00:29:35.723]  It's essential in the body.
[00:29:35.723 --> 00:29:39.365]  But we have our amazing Tri-Iodine, a big shipment came in.
[00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:42.887]  We're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[00:29:42.887 --> 00:29:48.530]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:54.613]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[00:29:54.953 --> 00:29:56.214]  You and your family will love it.
[00:29:56.214 --> 00:29:57.255]  It's incredible for your body.
[00:29:57.255 --> 00:29:59.277]  Get it at Infolwerstore.com today.
[00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:05.983]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[00:30:05.983 --> 00:30:09.546]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:12.028]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[00:30:12.028 --> 00:30:14.110]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.772]  It's well known for the things it does for our body.
[00:30:16.772 --> 00:30:18.314]  It makes our lives so much better.
[00:30:19.294 --> 00:30:23.155]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:25.295]  We've got both at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:25.295 --> 00:30:31.677]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock.
[00:30:31.677 --> 00:30:33.277]  Well, it's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:33.277 --> 00:30:42.499]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:42.879 --> 00:30:44.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:25.801]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this live Friday edition.
[00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:33.426]  When I get up here and I say, hey, we told you this here and there, and we showed you all this proof a decade ago, five years ago, it's not to say, hey, look, I'm smart.
[00:31:33.426 --> 00:31:35.987]  It's to say, listen, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:31:35.987 --> 00:31:38.729]  I'm on the right track.
[00:31:38.729 --> 00:31:50.176]  And if you go back, I don't know how long ago this was now, 10, 12, 13 years ago, the MIAC report, we got a secret government document from the state police in Missouri.
[00:31:51.366 --> 00:32:03.975]  And it said that anybody that wants out of the UN, anybody that's pro-gun, anybody that's pro-Ron Paul, anybody that's pro-info wars is a terrorist, and in the future they need to be arrested.
[00:32:03.975 --> 00:32:09.359]  And that was the Southern Property Law Center teaching the police that.
[00:32:09.359 --> 00:32:20.127]  And then folks didn't believe it was real, and then California police gave us a similar document, and then Texas police gave us another document, and then New York police, state police, gave us another document.
[00:32:21.093 --> 00:32:31.103]  And about six months after I broke it, people couldn't believe it, the Attorney General came out and she said, yeah, this is actually true.
[00:32:31.103 --> 00:32:33.125]  And we're not ashamed of this.
[00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:38.109]  Then, years later, Obama came out in 2012.
[00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:42.834]  Obama in 2010 directed the Army in a secret Army manual.
[00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:55.692]  To prepare for gun confiscation, how to process citizens by social security number into, quote, re-education camps.
[00:32:55.692 --> 00:33:00.813]  And they even used the term re-education camp.
[00:33:00.813 --> 00:33:03.774]  Remember when Glenn Beck was going to debunk me and all that and then he couldn't debunk me?
[00:33:03.774 --> 00:33:05.834]  Because it was real.
[00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:08.155]  Look, I get why in hindsight Glenn Beck couldn't believe that.
[00:33:08.155 --> 00:33:12.656]  But that's just hard to believe that a document said re-education camp.
[00:33:12.656 --> 00:33:14.496]  Two years after we got that document,
[00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:22.910]  The Army itself declassified the internment, resettlement, re-education camp Army document.
[00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:27.951]  Anybody wants it, just type in armyreeducationcampdocumentinfowars.com.
[00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:34.312]  You'll go to the page, you'll see the Army manual, the Army number, and you can go look it up yourself.
[00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:42.214]  By the way, only because they got contacted, it was later confirmed, can I tell you that I was given that by good people inside U.S.
[00:33:42.214 --> 00:33:45.975]  Army Intelligence that were pissed off about being given a piece of traitorous crap.
[00:33:47.009 --> 00:33:51.071]  Oh, that was their duty, not just their right.
[00:33:51.071 --> 00:34:02.117]  When you're given a battle plan to take on the American people, that's illegal, and to make the majority of America an enemy, well obviously whoever gave that order is the damn enemy.
[00:34:02.117 --> 00:34:13.142]  So, my default position is to not want to go up against a bunch of murdering crooks at the top of the FBI and the CIA and the rest of it, but somebody's got to do this.
[00:34:13.142 --> 00:34:14.683]  I mean, our country is hijacked.
[00:34:14.683 --> 00:34:16.404]  I cannot not do this.
[00:34:17.774 --> 00:34:21.676]  And if other people had my attitude, we would not be in this bad position we're in.
[00:34:21.676 --> 00:34:39.766]  So, when you turn on the news and you see the former Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI saying, with very menacing face, we need to attack and take out, those are quotes, members of Congress.
[00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:46.450]  Maybe one thing if a shoe salesman said we need to attack and take out members of Congress, you'd go, hey, send the Secret Service, send the Federal Marshals,
[00:34:48.243 --> 00:34:52.686]  Talk to them, make sure they're not serious, and warn them they could get serious jail time for that, because that's a real threat.
[00:34:52.686 --> 00:34:55.827]  But you're a shoe salesman.
[00:34:55.827 --> 00:35:12.257]  When you've been over counter-terrorism, been involved in operations to kill people extra-judicially, and you say that, then you go, oh, that's what you do for a job, and you're in power, and you say you're coming to kill us.
[00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:22.182]  Well, I take that very, very serious, mister.
[00:35:22.182 --> 00:35:24.683]  You're darn tootin' to quote your FBI director.
[00:35:24.683 --> 00:35:28.306]  I take that as direct threat to me and my family.
[00:35:28.306 --> 00:35:29.986]  And I know it's what it's meant to be.
[00:35:29.986 --> 00:35:31.027]  Threaten me?
[00:35:31.027 --> 00:35:32.568]  Threaten my family?
[00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:33.809]  Threaten Congress?
[00:35:33.809 --> 00:35:35.870]  You dirty little filthy lawyer!
[00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.371]  You piece of crap!
[00:35:37.371 --> 00:35:38.892]  Who the hell do you think you are?
[00:35:38.892 --> 00:35:43.014]  I know who you think you are.
[00:35:43.014 --> 00:35:44.595]  You think you rule this country.
[00:35:45.495 --> 00:35:46.856]  You think everybody's intimidated?
[00:35:46.856 --> 00:35:50.737]  Well, I'm not!
[00:35:50.737 --> 00:35:52.218]  You people are the problem.
[00:35:52.218 --> 00:35:54.919]  You're the ones destroying the country.
[00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.240]  You're the ones destabilizing everything.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.562]  You're the ones screwing the nation over.
[00:36:00.562 --> 00:36:04.764]  Look at Soros with over 800, last time I checked, district attorneys.
[00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:10.386]  It was even more county attorneys, sheriffs, magistrates, mayors.
[00:36:10.386 --> 00:36:11.867]  It's in the thousands.
[00:36:11.867 --> 00:36:13.888]  Almost every major city run by them.
[00:36:14.993 --> 00:36:19.656]  I have a super liberal lawyer that works for me in family matters.
[00:36:19.656 --> 00:36:20.597]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:36:20.597 --> 00:36:23.819]  But he said, Alex, I'm scared for my family.
[00:36:23.819 --> 00:36:31.665]  He said they released in Austin armed robbers that have shot people now with no bail.
[00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:33.586]  Crime is exploding.
[00:36:33.586 --> 00:36:38.389]  They are literally destroying the country by design.
[00:36:44.344 --> 00:37:00.187]  So they take away the police, they jack up your power prices, your streets fall apart, but oh, racism is an environmental crisis in Chicago, the mayor says.
[00:37:00.187 --> 00:37:02.887]  It's all a distraction for the takeover of the country.
[00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.288]  They're devaluing the currency, they're annihilating it all.
[00:37:05.288 --> 00:37:12.249]  And all I'm saying is to people on the fence, in the general public, in the government, in the FBI, in whoever you are,
[00:37:13.903 --> 00:37:20.866]  This submission to the corporate media and this submission to globalism is suicidal, politically.
[00:37:20.866 --> 00:37:22.907]  It's destructive as hell.
[00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:30.831]  It's going to end in total collapse, and I know that's the globalist plan, but do most of you going along with it have an exit strategy?
[00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:35.713]  Even if you want to see America go down, you're going to go down with it.
[00:37:35.713 --> 00:37:36.534]  It's megalomania.
[00:37:36.534 --> 00:37:39.035]  So here's Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:37:39.798 --> 00:37:41.559]  This is from 10 years ago.
[00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:50.884]  He had a whole special on it, but here's just two minutes of it, talking about the FBI and how the majority of plots were actually hatched and run by them.
[00:37:50.884 --> 00:37:52.945]  And that's the same thing going on with January 6th.
[00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:55.126]  Here it is.
[00:37:55.126 --> 00:37:57.787]  Does the government work for us or do we work for the government?
[00:37:57.787 --> 00:38:02.249]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:38:02.249 --> 00:38:07.712]  Tonight, has the federal government kept us safe or does it just want us to think that it has kept us safe?
[00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:20.979]  Since the tragedy of 9-11, numerous crazies and low-level copycats have engaged in criminal behavior which they hoped would result in the deaths of innocent Americans and somehow advance their cause of jihad.
[00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:33.905]  If you ask the leadership of the FBI, most of whose field agents are tireless, dedicated, Constitution-supporting professionals, it will tell you that it, the FBI, has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:38.481]  What it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots.
[00:38:38.481 --> 00:38:41.984]  And of them, three were interrupted by members of the public.
[00:38:41.984 --> 00:38:47.068]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:38:47.068 --> 00:38:49.830]  We all remember the three that were foiled by diligent Americans.
[00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:50.591]  The shoe bomber,
[00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:54.010]  The Underwear Bomber and the Times Square Bomber.
[00:38:54.010 --> 00:39:00.331]  In all of these cases, the crimes charged were those of attempting to kill and conspiring with others to do so.
[00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:11.174]  In all three of those cases, alert Americans on transcontinental flights or in the streets of New York City told authorities of bizarre behavior or actually subdued the threats themselves.
[00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:13.214]  There was no foiling by the FBI.
[00:39:13.214 --> 00:39:20.116]  The plotters were, thankfully, bumbling fools who had poorly planned their criminal behavior and who ended up harming no one.
[00:39:20.636 --> 00:39:22.878]  All three are serving life terms.
[00:39:22.878 --> 00:39:29.183]  But the more curious cases are the remaining 17 for which the federal government has taken credit.
[00:39:29.183 --> 00:39:32.266]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:36.990]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:49.817]  In all of these 17 cases, from the Fort Dix 6, to the Lackawanna 7, to the Portland Parade bomber, the Feds found young men of Muslim backgrounds, loners who were bitter in America.
[00:39:49.817 --> 00:39:54.862]  They befriended them, cajoled them, and persuaded them that they could change the world by killing Americans.
[00:39:55.589 --> 00:40:00.770]  In return for leniency, Twitter doesn't let you have the full report, but we have the full report and later in the broadcast
[00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:23.409]  We're good to go.
[00:40:46.084 --> 00:40:53.623]  Meanwhile, Frank DiGliusi is on TV saying we need to direct attacks on members of Congress to take them out because they're patriots.
[00:40:53.623 --> 00:40:55.487]  They're the ones engaged in criminal conspiracies.
[00:40:58.232 --> 00:41:10.286]  In the last 16 months, InfoWars researchers have been hard at work developing the ultimate, high-quality, affordable systems to boost your body's natural defenses and make you have an overall healthier, happier life.

[00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:05.323]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:11.148]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[00:42:11.148 --> 00:42:16.714]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[00:42:16.714 --> 00:42:19.557]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[00:42:19.557 --> 00:42:21.398]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:25.562]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[00:42:25.562 --> 00:42:29.265]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[00:42:29.265 --> 00:42:35.390]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.653]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:48.702]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[00:42:48.702 --> 00:42:55.548]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune Support Pack.

[00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:08.074]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[00:43:08.074 --> 00:43:11.639]  Magnesium is required for your body to do the following.
[00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:13.882]  Helps convert food into energy.
[00:43:14.517 --> 00:43:17.021]  Helps with muscle contraction function.
[00:43:17.021 --> 00:43:19.004]  Helps regulate the nervous system.
[00:43:19.004 --> 00:43:22.930]  Helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more.
[00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:28.739]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium.
[00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.461]  It tastes great.
[00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:31.202]  I take it in the morning.
[00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:32.643]  I take it in the evening.
[00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:37.687]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.

[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.261]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:26.073 --> 00:45:28.875]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:28.875 --> 00:45:53.367]  The reason I spent a lot of time, obviously, in the last segment, getting into the FBI, the Justice Department's announcements that they want to take out members of Congress, that we're all terrorist network, that's got to be financially shut down, physically shut up, physically put in prison, or killed, is because they are globalist criminals that have taken the country over and gotten these agency heads to sign on to it.
[00:45:54.176 --> 00:45:57.539]  Because they were promoted from down low because they were corrupt.
[00:45:57.539 --> 00:46:05.505]  And now they know that America's woken up, and America is beating them, and America is legally and lawfully taking back the country.
[00:46:05.505 --> 00:46:09.168]  And rejecting their race war, and rejecting open borders, and rejecting it.
[00:46:09.168 --> 00:46:15.153]  So they're just accelerating the collapse as fast as they can, so the nation is a failed state.
[00:46:16.687 --> 00:46:26.709]  And so, we'll be too busy just trying to feed ourselves or get our electrical power back on, or to stop a race war, than to be able to ever remove them from office, legally and lawfully.
[00:46:26.709 --> 00:46:31.790]  Not as terrorists, as the left wants to do, but through an election.
[00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:35.410]  Through a legal, lawful process.
[00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:41.171]  And the reason, going back to the documents we first got about constitutional terrorists, in 2009 and 2010,
[00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:49.741]  People couldn't believe that then, but they were real documents that later they confirmed they were.
[00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:52.543]  The Attorney General later did.
[00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:55.786]  People didn't know what to say when she came out and admitted it all.
[00:46:55.786 --> 00:47:01.350]  And so now you see it again, but out in the open with it being official U.S.
[00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.511]  government policy.
[00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:05.072]  Official U.S.
[00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.233]  government policy.
[00:47:06.233 --> 00:47:08.915]  A sea change in counter-terrorism.
[00:47:08.915 --> 00:47:10.596]  The Lawfare blog.
[00:47:10.596 --> 00:47:12.638]  The Washington Post has similar headlines.
[00:47:13.286 --> 00:47:18.610]  And he goes on to say, no longer is it Islamic terrorism, or the Chinese, or the Russians, no!
[00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:24.213]  The CIA, all of it is pointed inward at the people of the nation.
[00:47:24.213 --> 00:47:38.503]  Fake terror plots, paid informants, the tactics of the FBI, entrapment questioned in the New York Times, and the London Guardian, where out of a hundred plus cases, one hundred plus, every one of them, was a staged event.
[00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:46.997]  We just showed you some of that famous piece with Andrew Napolitano breaking it down so long ago.
[00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:59.846]  So when you see Tucker Carlson come out and it's in hundreds of publications attacking him saying he's crazy, how dare him say there might have been informants on January 6th, there might have been provocateurs.
[00:47:59.846 --> 00:48:03.469]  They were crawling all over the place.
[00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:11.555]  I remember trying to go cover military drills where the military had told us they were training for martial law takeover in Florida.
[00:48:12.932 --> 00:48:14.553]  Because the military was concerned about it.
[00:48:14.553 --> 00:48:16.154]  They contacted us.
[00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:21.718]  So I just simply went to cover it in Florida.
[00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:29.904]  And I'd be out there by the airport, just legally with a camera, and a special ops guy would just jump out and start setting fire, saying, Alex, don't you agree?
[00:48:29.904 --> 00:48:32.286]  We're gonna burn things down.
[00:48:32.286 --> 00:48:38.491]  And myself and Mike Hanson had to put the fire out and physically restrain the guy and say, I'm going to kick your ass.
[00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:43.348]  And then the guy ran off into the bushes and was following us around in an unmarked car.
[00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:47.989]  That's what the feds do.
[00:48:47.989 --> 00:48:51.770]  I had him try it again when I was covering Bilderberg in Virginia.
[00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:54.810]  I guess that was about, was it 2008, 2009?
[00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:56.551]  You know, Bilderberg that doesn't exist.
[00:48:56.551 --> 00:48:57.871]  I guess Obama had just been elected.
[00:48:57.871 --> 00:48:58.911]  It was 2009.
[00:48:58.911 --> 00:49:01.532]  Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:49:01.532 --> 00:49:05.593]  And we'd be sitting in our hotel at night just, you know, having a hamburger or whatever, drinking a beer.
[00:49:05.593 --> 00:49:07.553]  Guys would come over and sit down right next to us and say,
[00:49:08.163 --> 00:49:12.764]  We think we need to blow up that Chantilly Hotel.
[00:49:12.764 --> 00:49:16.825]  And I had these reporters with me that were following us that made the film New World Order.
[00:49:16.825 --> 00:49:20.606]  And after the guys got, they said, you know, those guys are, those guys are like FBI.
[00:49:20.606 --> 00:49:21.727]  Those guys are trying to set you up.
[00:49:21.727 --> 00:49:23.167]  Hey, my dad's a cop.
[00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:23.767]  Believe me.
[00:49:23.767 --> 00:49:28.208]  I go, you don't think I don't know that?
[00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:29.889]  And I go, by the way, they're not cops.
[00:49:29.889 --> 00:49:32.209]  They're with the Marines.
[00:49:32.209 --> 00:49:34.430]  I saw him earlier before I snuck back out of the hotel.
[00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:36.400]  Because they were so pissed.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.063]  I was inside the hotel when they actually closed it for about six hours.
[00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:42.384]  They freaked out so bad.
[00:49:42.384 --> 00:49:46.147]  I suppose they're Marine Corps officers in plain clothes.
[00:49:46.147 --> 00:49:53.252]  But... And then later they got on an elevator and were threatening me and stuff.
[00:49:53.252 --> 00:49:58.676]  So, just, this is what... This is what goes on.
[00:49:58.676 --> 00:50:01.539]  But now they just go one extension further.
[00:50:01.539 --> 00:50:04.661]  Let's go ahead with the woke military and the woke police that are left.
[00:50:05.427 --> 00:50:19.418]  Stage big events so they can purge the military, purge the police, and start the mass arrest that will trigger a civil war, which will bring the country into martial law permanently, and then we are going to be an occupied globalist country.
[00:50:19.418 --> 00:50:20.439]  And that's how they want it.
[00:50:20.439 --> 00:50:25.163]  That's why they brought in 50 million Muslims into Europe.
[00:50:25.163 --> 00:50:28.706]  It's so they can have a group they control that can destabilize the country whenever they want.
[00:50:28.706 --> 00:50:31.128]  And now they're going to do it in America along racial lines.
[00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:34.210]  And they admit they're doing it!
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:40.373]  They admit in the Atlantic Council, and they admit in the WikiLeaks documents that they're going to use race in all of this.
[00:50:40.373 --> 00:50:44.414]  And so they're announcing 65% of the population is terrorist?
[00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:45.974]  And that being white is bad?
[00:50:45.974 --> 00:50:47.915]  And we debate whether that's true or not?
[00:50:47.915 --> 00:50:50.376]  This is outrageous!
[00:50:50.376 --> 00:50:55.938]  And must be completely rejected!
[00:50:55.938 --> 00:50:59.439]  I have zero guilt wanting to go storm the Capitol and
[00:51:00.274 --> 00:51:07.919]  Foment riots and make us all look like fools and not get our 10-day investigation we wanted of election fraud.
[00:51:07.919 --> 00:51:14.683]  We were there to show our numbers and show we didn't accept the election results because we knew there was fraud and a call for an investigation.
[00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:17.365]  We don't have a motive to do that.
[00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:20.647]  Did I trust that Trump would have somewhat of the control?
[00:51:20.647 --> 00:51:23.268]  He called for National Guard, they didn't get him.
[00:51:23.268 --> 00:51:25.570]  The mayor said no, the mayor, the leader of DC.
[00:51:27.836 --> 00:51:37.123]  Did I just trust in the system and thought, oh, well, there's no way the police will actually stand down, which they did because they sent the majority of them away for traffic control.
[00:51:37.123 --> 00:51:41.627]  And so am I guilty of walking into an absolute trap?
[00:51:41.627 --> 00:51:43.789]  Absolutely.
[00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:50.974]  But by the grace of God, it fizzled and wasn't one-tenth as bad as the deep state had planned it to be.
[00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:54.177]  Because you had thousands of people believing they were under Q command.
[00:51:56.843 --> 00:52:02.089]  But thank God I and others got there and stopped them from going into the building.
[00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:04.852]  Or it would have been many, many, many, many, many times worse.
[00:52:04.852 --> 00:52:08.015]  But I can replay this over and over again in my head.
[00:52:08.015 --> 00:52:11.119]  I wish it never would have happened.
[00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:15.984]  But now to have all these people and their lawyers contact me.
[00:52:19.515 --> 00:52:38.144]  And to have the FBI come visit people that have been guests here, people that have worked here, and you name it, and say, just tell us about Alex Jones, and what he's planning, and how he's planning violence, and what he does with money, and anything illegal, and we're not going to put you in jail.
[00:52:38.144 --> 00:52:40.325]  So does it matter I've done zero wrong?
[00:52:40.325 --> 00:52:42.927]  Does it matter I'm a Boy Scout?
[00:52:42.927 --> 00:52:43.827]  It doesn't matter.
[00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:47.349]  It's because I'm a Boy Scout that I've got to be made an example of.
[00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.869]  But you know what?
[00:52:49.571 --> 00:52:54.112]  I respect the viewers and listeners of this show, and I think you're the same type of person I am, no matter what color you are.
[00:52:54.112 --> 00:52:55.793]  You've got red blood and you love God.
[00:52:55.793 --> 00:52:59.194]  That if you see me set up or destroyed, you're not going to back down because of that.
[00:52:59.194 --> 00:53:05.436]  You're going to fight harder than ever to wake people up and to take our country back from this evil.
[00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:07.456]  So I trust in God.
[00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:13.998]  But see, these evil people that work for the government, they project their own cowardice, their own follower nature onto us.
[00:53:14.722 --> 00:53:16.923]  And they think this intimidates us.
[00:53:16.923 --> 00:53:17.543]  No.
[00:53:17.543 --> 00:53:22.004]  This makes me work a lot harder, have a lot more energy, and know that I'm on the right side of history.
[00:53:22.004 --> 00:53:27.346]  I just pray to God to give me the strength to do a good job, because I make mistakes, and man, I mess up.
[00:53:27.346 --> 00:53:28.887]  Don't we all?
[00:53:28.887 --> 00:53:39.510]  And that I can touch your heart, and that God can touch your heart through my show, using me as a vessel to know how important you are, and how much God loves you, and how love and coming together is the answer.
[00:53:40.612 --> 00:53:48.894]  I know I get angry as hell, and that's a good motivator, but at the end of the day, we need to do this because we love each other, and we care about justice, and we care about our children together.
[00:53:48.894 --> 00:53:51.815]  Now, I haven't hit the huge vaccine news.
[00:53:51.815 --> 00:53:52.575]  It's the worst yet.
[00:53:52.575 --> 00:53:55.196]  A lot of young airline pilots are dying after the vaccine.
[00:53:55.196 --> 00:54:00.398]  British Airways admits that's the case, even in a fact-check article, so this is really serious.
[00:54:00.398 --> 00:54:07.360]  Also, the enslavement of the NFL players, where they're treated like animals and enslaved if they don't take the deadly shots.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.480]  There's so much on that front.
[00:54:09.884 --> 00:54:13.147]  That is all coming up as well.
[00:54:13.147 --> 00:54:16.329]  There is just a lot that we're going to be going through today.
[00:54:16.329 --> 00:54:18.331]  Such an important broadcast.
[00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:23.636]  Please also remember, without your financial support, we're not going to be on air.

[00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:35.986]  They have been good sellers.
[00:54:37.958 --> 00:54:43.060]  But we're still not bringing in the funds we need to fight this properly.

[00:57:37.608 --> 00:57:39.229]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:22.737]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:22.737 --> 00:58:28.782]  John Pierce, founder and CEO of National Constitutional Law Union, represents a lot of the people being set up
[00:58:29.837 --> 00:58:36.858]  By this Reichstag 2.0 event, he will be joining us coming up.
[00:58:36.858 --> 00:58:37.638]  Hell, who knows?
[00:58:37.638 --> 00:58:38.418]  I might need him.
[00:58:38.418 --> 00:58:50.661]  I've got some good criminal lawyers, but I have absolutely confirmed now that the FBI is going around to a bunch of people saying, we're going to put you in jail unless you tell us about Alex Jones wanting to overthrow the government.
[00:58:50.661 --> 00:58:59.242]  When we have Frank Figliosi and others on TV saying they, quote, want to attack members of Congress as terrorists and, quote, remove them using
[00:59:00.498 --> 00:59:03.263]  The Patriot Act, which I thought wasn't for citizens.
[00:59:03.263 --> 00:59:06.068]  So everything they say we're doing, they're doing.
[00:59:06.068 --> 00:59:07.130]  It's out of control.
[00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:09.895]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:59:09.895 --> 00:59:11.477]  But I'm not afraid for myself.
[00:59:11.477 --> 00:59:13.321]  I am really concerned for the country, though, because
[00:59:14.053 --> 00:59:15.934]  It's like getting the news one day you got cancer.
[00:59:15.934 --> 00:59:16.874]  Everybody knows it's coming.
[00:59:16.874 --> 00:59:18.034]  That or a heart attack.
[00:59:18.034 --> 00:59:19.575]  You know, I'm at peace with it.
[00:59:19.575 --> 00:59:20.835]  Especially doing the right thing.
[00:59:20.835 --> 00:59:27.757]  But to know that they're that criminal, they're that out of control, they've really converted the government from the top corrupt right down to the bottom.
[00:59:27.757 --> 00:59:29.357]  And America itself has cancer.
[00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:31.118]  So we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
[00:59:31.118 --> 00:59:36.659]  After he leaves us, they have the equivalent of the Chinese CIA director.
[00:59:36.659 --> 00:59:38.480]  The highest level defector ever from China.
[00:59:39.759 --> 00:59:54.413]  Who's explaining to them exactly what's going on, and he's reportedly handed over to the FBI, which means it goes into a black hole, the complete list of people on the Chinese Communist payroll, like Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and of course, Biden's brothers.
[00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:57.852]  We'll be talking about all of that coming up.
[00:59:57.852 --> 01:00:02.955]  And of course, the defectors talking about how the Chinese knew about the virus because they were busy cooking it up.
[01:00:02.955 --> 01:00:06.697]  In fact, they bought the virus from Obama who sold it to them.
[01:00:06.697 --> 01:00:08.258]  So now they're pointing fingers back and forth.
[01:00:08.258 --> 01:00:09.298]  The Chinese are actually true.
[01:00:09.298 --> 01:00:13.020]  It came from Obama and Chapel Hill.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.601]  They just built upon the virus.
[01:00:15.766 --> 01:00:18.147]  And it's gained a function at Wuhan.
[01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:21.488]  People ask, how did I know all this 16 months ago?
[01:00:21.488 --> 01:00:22.528]  This was a major debate in 2015.
[01:00:22.528 --> 01:00:28.370]  This was in almost every prestigious genetic engineering and bioweapon journal.
[01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.131]  I mean, we covered it at the time.
[01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:31.852]  It was in like the Journal of Nature, you name it.
[01:00:33.576 --> 01:00:39.040]  John Stewart was on earlier this week and really made Colbert look like a fool, because he's like, oh, how dare you say it came from one.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.264]  He goes, it's called the Wuhan Coronavirus Gain-of-Function Lab.
[01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:47.527]  I mean, literally that whole bunch of labs, but each lab has its own name for its own grant.
[01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:50.089]  They had a bunch of coronavirus gain-of-function stuff there.
[01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:52.791]  So just like we know the Fed's provocateur of it.
[01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:54.312]  I mean, we know because they've done it over and over again.
[01:00:54.312 --> 01:00:54.913]  It's the same thing.
[01:00:54.913 --> 01:00:57.615]  We know the modus operandi.
[01:00:57.615 --> 01:00:58.556]  So that's coming up.
[01:00:58.556 --> 01:00:59.897]  Hong Kong pays off
[01:01:00.737 --> 01:01:05.200]  Three patients who suffered adverse reactions to COVID vaccines.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.683]  China pushes theory that coronavirus originated in a lab, but says it was from a U.S.
[01:01:08.683 --> 01:01:09.743]  bioweapon lab.
[01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:11.745]  Well, because it was.
[01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:14.607]  Four healthy British airway pilots die in one week.
[01:01:14.607 --> 01:01:17.049]  Airline says no link to COVID vaccine.
[01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:20.371]  And they have a fact check in Reuters saying, is it true?
[01:01:20.371 --> 01:01:21.892]  They go, well, yeah, they did die.
[01:01:21.892 --> 01:01:25.595]  We don't know why, but we're not having high level talks about it.
[01:01:25.595 --> 01:01:25.775]  OK.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.682]  Vaccinated travelers won't be allowed to fly due to blood clot in certain countries, like China.
[01:01:35.682 --> 01:01:46.104]  Giant mistake, CDC delays emergency meeting on post-vax heart inflammation due to Juneteenth, a holiday not even celebrated in Texas.
[01:01:46.104 --> 01:01:52.826]  I mean, I'm all for, let's have Martin Luther King Day 2.0 or something, but Rosa Parks Day, but no, it's Juneteenth Day.
[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:58.695]  But you got to delay emergency hearing about people dying because you know that.
[01:01:58.695 --> 01:02:01.138]  Top Chinese official defected to the U.S.
[01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:02.179]  with Wuhan secrets.
[01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:05.702]  Again, we'll be getting more of that coming up later.
[01:02:05.702 --> 01:02:09.806]  Scientists admit lab link theory was dismissed due to fear of racism.
[01:02:09.806 --> 01:02:12.349]  Yes, racism.
[01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:15.812]  Former State Department investigator China already knew the origin of the pandemic.
[01:02:15.812 --> 01:02:16.353]  Of course they did.
[01:02:17.685 --> 01:02:18.786]  Why'd our media try to cover it up?
[01:02:18.786 --> 01:02:21.468]  Because it goes back to Biden and Obama.
[01:02:21.468 --> 01:02:21.928]  Mic drop!
[01:02:21.928 --> 01:02:29.154]  Representative Thomas Massey, Schools Reporter, who asks if he's vaccinated by the COVID vaccine, explains to him, I've already had it, you idiot.
[01:02:29.154 --> 01:02:33.437]  And you see, folks, if you've had it and take the vaccine, that's when you get the really bad reactions.
[01:02:33.437 --> 01:02:38.501]  And that's a fact, but, you know, all these big venues in New York parks and places don't care.
[01:02:38.501 --> 01:02:43.765]  They go, doesn't matter whether if your doctor says the vaccine might hurt you because you already have anaphylactic issues.
[01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:45.086]  Take it!
[01:02:45.086 --> 01:02:46.267]  We're all your doctors now.
[01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:52.541]  Well, finally, Trump's starting to wake up, says COVID vaccine for young people unnecessary, probably dangerous.
[01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:53.162]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:53.162 --> 01:02:53.583]  Stay with us.
[01:02:57.191 --> 01:03:06.197]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.

[01:03:58.846 --> 01:04:06.228]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:04:32.776 --> 01:04:35.537]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:04:35.537 --> 01:04:44.382]  We're now into hour number two as we broadcast worldwide on this June 18th Friday transmission.
[01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:48.984]  Well, you've seen Tucker Carlson come out and point out that there's clearly FBI informants and others
[01:04:49.702 --> 01:04:55.671]  Being protected in what happened at the Capitol event on January 6th, we're being told is the biggest insurrection in U.S.
[01:04:55.671 --> 01:05:00.218]  history, as bad as Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11, and then building on that,
[01:05:03.112 --> 01:05:12.459]  The system is now saying that they want to use the military, the CIA, the Patriot Act to frustrate the leadership that causes radicalization.
[01:05:12.459 --> 01:05:28.631]  So now if you say things like the election was stolen or Biden's a communist Chinese agent, well they're saying that's incitement and so you can be arrested, you can be grabbed, you can be gone after because of all of that.
[01:05:29.696 --> 01:05:33.579]  Well, he represents more than 10 people that have been arrested.
[01:05:33.579 --> 01:05:45.788]  John M. Pierce is a trial lawyer, founder and managing partner of Pierce Brainbridge Constitutional Civil Liberties and Business Litigation Law Firm, a graduate of Harvard Law, where he served as the editor of the Harvard Law Review.
[01:05:45.788 --> 01:05:47.750]  Oh, that's something even Obama did, too.
[01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:53.334]  Prior to law school, John was an M1A1 Abrams tank platoon leader in the U.S.
[01:05:53.334 --> 01:05:53.614]  Army.
[01:05:53.614 --> 01:05:54.335]  In 2017, he founded
[01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:57.733]  We're good to go.
[01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:22.033]  Law union to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
[01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:24.475]  NCLU.com.
[01:06:24.475 --> 01:06:26.076]  NCLU.com.
[01:06:26.076 --> 01:06:28.377]  National Constitutional Law Union.
[01:06:28.377 --> 01:06:38.785]  And I couldn't think of a better time to have a heavy hitter like this patriot, this veteran on our side because clearly they're going, they said they want to round up their political opposition.
[01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:40.026]  And so he joins us now.
[01:06:40.026 --> 01:06:40.787]  John, thanks for coming on.
[01:06:42.236 --> 01:06:50.744]  Thank you so much for having me on again, Alex, and thank you for everything you were doing to help these American patriots and to stand up and fight for the Constitution.
[01:06:51.332 --> 01:06:56.135]  I don't mean to put myself gonzo journalism style front and center here, but I probably need to talk to you.
[01:06:56.135 --> 01:07:01.839]  I need to call some other criminal lawyers that I've had to contact and talk to, but you've been really in the middle of this.
[01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:05.202]  My lawyers haven't been, so I'll probably stay and talk to you anyways.
[01:07:05.202 --> 01:07:16.730]  I have the FBI circling around talking to former employees, people that I barely even know or hardly ever talk to, asking them, so it's a whole spectrum, you know, tell us about Alex Jones and how he planned it.
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:21.594]  What he's planning to do in the future or anything illegal Alex Jones is doing.
[01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:25.358]  They've got this dragnet out to get me and I know a lot of other people as well.
[01:07:27.692 --> 01:07:33.738]  So clearly the federal government has gotten, you know, very aggressive on these fronts.
[01:07:33.738 --> 01:07:37.021]  And this has been going on, you know, for the last few years.
[01:07:37.021 --> 01:07:47.570]  And as I think you know, I really started to get involved in the middle of this a few years ago when I started to represent George Papadopoulos, who I ultimately was successful in helping getting pardoned by President Trump.
[01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:51.893]  I represent Carter Page with respect to all the FISA abuse litigation.
[01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:55.495]  I actually represented Tulsi Gabbard against Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:55.495 --> 01:08:00.638]  As you know, represented Kyle Rittenhouse those first six months and now have all these Capitol Hill defendants.
[01:08:00.638 --> 01:08:08.423]  There is no question that in the last few years, you know, the law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country has gotten, you know, very aggressive.
[01:08:09.263 --> 01:08:22.012]  It has accelerated at a very rapid pace since the Biden administration has taken over, and our constitutional rights are being shredded, eviscerated day by day, and it is happening very fast.
[01:08:22.012 --> 01:08:28.337]  And so that's why I started the NCLU, essentially the answer to the ACLU, which is completely done.
[01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.178]  I mean, they don't do anything anymore.
[01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:31.038]  We're good to go.
[01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:53.176]  John, I hadn't forgotten the George Papadopoulos thing and that whole setup and how you were on.
[01:08:53.176 --> 01:08:54.637]  There's just so much to cover.
[01:08:54.637 --> 01:08:55.578]  So much has gone on.
[01:08:55.578 --> 01:09:01.942]  But the illegal spying on Trump, the lying about it, the lying to Congress, and now just the escalation in corruption.
[01:09:01.942 --> 01:09:03.223]  They never got in trouble.
[01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:15.371]  So it looks like they're even more emboldened than ever with Frank Figliuzzi of the FBI on TV saying, let's use anti-terror tactics and take out the networks, including the leaders in Congress.
[01:09:15.371 --> 01:09:17.653]  Well, all that is, let's take out bin Laden.
[01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.313]  Let's take out
[01:09:19.396 --> 01:09:24.570]  Well, this is classic military nomenclature.
[01:09:26.632 --> 01:09:28.693]  This is very brazen.
[01:09:28.693 --> 01:09:29.933]  It is very aggressive.
[01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:44.857]  I don't think it's something that folks like you and I, well, you know, you might have seen it coming before I did, but, you know, this is not the country I grew up in, and, you know, I'm actually very saddened, you know, shocked and surprised to see how aggressive these things are happening.
[01:09:44.857 --> 01:09:53.440]  It doesn't seem like something that should be or would happen in the United States, but it is happening, and we all need to stand up and fight against it.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:04.605]  How would you categorize it as a veteran, as a lawyer, as a smart guy that's been studying this, and on the inside of it, as an authoritarian takeover, as a political purge?
[01:10:04.605 --> 01:10:07.206]  I mean, because this is classical tyranny.
[01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:19.016]  Oh, I think, look, generally speaking, and I need to be, as you know, I need to be careful in talking about the specific cases that I'm involved in as a lawyer with respect to the defendants, you know, on January 6th.
[01:10:19.016 --> 01:10:24.719]  But as I have said, and as, you know, I've said in connection with founding the NCLU,
[01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:32.165]  Generally speaking, I think this is an attempted leftist totalitarian takeover of the United States.
[01:10:32.165 --> 01:10:36.048]  It's very similar to a Maoist revolution.
[01:10:36.048 --> 01:10:40.151]  The playbook is very standard and well-worn throughout history.
[01:10:40.151 --> 01:10:43.614]  They attempt to destroy everything that is old and sacred in society.
[01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.215]  They attempt to tear down statues.
[01:10:45.555 --> 01:10:57.000]  They attempt to break up the nuclear family, they attempt to attack religion, they attempt to destroy history so that they can rewrite on a blank slate whatever they want and create sort of a cult of each state.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:09.985]  They take over the local police, they destabilize the culture, they debase the country, they destroy the borders, they collapse the civilization and out of that crisis set up a new central government that then carries out a giant purge of its enemies that last decades.
[01:11:11.364 --> 01:11:12.285]  That's precisely right.
[01:11:12.285 --> 01:11:23.792]  And I think one of the scariest things that you're seeing on this front, you know, obviously they've been very successful on taking over those institutions that you mentioned, you know, academia, you know, the media, Wall Street, Silicon Valley.
[01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:31.117]  I'm very concerned about the way they seem to be making a very hard go at taking over the military with this wokeness.
[01:11:32.097 --> 01:11:45.224]  This stuff where you see sort of the constant talk about race and critical race theory and transgender rights and these sort of things, that has no place in the United States military.
[01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:47.665]  The United States military is there for one purpose.
[01:11:47.665 --> 01:11:50.966]  It's there to fight and win wars, to close with and destroy the enemy.
[01:11:50.966 --> 01:11:54.348]  When I was in the 1st Cavalry Division, there was no such thing.
[01:11:54.568 --> 01:11:54.908]  Well, exactly.
[01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:23.940]  What they're doing to the military with this malice brainwashing is the perfect way to destroy the unit cohesion, to break them down, to turn people against each other.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.703]  They know exactly what they're doing and so does the new Secretary of Defense.
[01:12:28.715 --> 01:12:29.635]  Oh, that's absolutely right.
[01:12:29.635 --> 01:12:32.436]  I mean, this is a plan.
[01:12:32.436 --> 01:12:54.663]  I mean, I think you saw it a couple months ago when there was a concerted, coordinated attack against an American journalist, Tucker Carlson, who simply sort of questioned whether they should be focused on maternity uniforms when they were promoting marine female generals at a ceremony instead of their service record.
[01:12:54.663 --> 01:12:55.283]  He questioned that.
[01:12:55.623 --> 01:13:06.847]  And the next day, the entire leadership of the Department of Defense, all of the spokespeople, all of the branches, they attacked him in a very concerted, very direct, very vicious way.
[01:13:06.847 --> 01:13:08.768]  Now, fortunately, there was a real blowback from that.
[01:13:08.768 --> 01:13:12.910]  And fortunately, folks like Tucker and yourself, you know, do not bow to the mob.
[01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.631]  And that really, you know, fell by the wayside.
[01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:18.832]  But, you know, you see these commercials for the CIA where they're celebrating
[01:13:19.432 --> 01:13:22.914]  You know, diversity and anxiety disorder and all these things.
[01:13:22.914 --> 01:13:28.718]  And by the way, those in and of themselves are not bad things to be talking about, but that's not what the CIA is there for.
[01:13:28.718 --> 01:13:31.140]  That's not what the United States military is there for.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.281]  They're there for one purpose.
[01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:33.582]  They're not a social experiment.
[01:13:33.582 --> 01:13:37.224]  There's not a human right to serve in the military or the CIA.
[01:13:37.224 --> 01:13:41.507]  Those entities need the best and brightest among us who are going to accomplish the mission, and that's it.
[01:13:42.253 --> 01:13:42.813]  Oh, that's right.
[01:13:42.813 --> 01:13:53.722]  And we're going to come back and talk about what's happening with January 6th, how it's being used as the narrative, as the legend for this new civil war they're trying to trigger with all these people that have chips on their shoulders.
[01:13:53.722 --> 01:13:54.563]  Be right back.
[01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:58.926]  Stay with us.
[01:13:58.926 --> 01:14:01.007]  Your voice counts.
[01:14:01.007 --> 01:14:06.071]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:08.653]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.434]  They know you're angry.
[01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:15.541]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:24.774]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports,

[01:14:30.455 --> 01:14:32.995]  That's 833-470-0438 for InfoWars Emergency News Alerts.

[01:14:57.282 --> 01:15:03.986]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[01:15:03.986 --> 01:15:07.548]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[01:15:07.548 --> 01:15:10.010]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:12.091]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:14.753]  It's well known for the things it does for our body.
[01:15:14.753 --> 01:15:16.334]  It makes our lives so much better.
[01:15:17.014 --> 01:15:21.178]  But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[01:15:21.178 --> 01:15:23.299]  We've got both at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:23.299 --> 01:15:29.685]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock.
[01:15:29.685 --> 01:15:31.386]  Well, it's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:31.386 --> 01:15:40.514]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:15:43.095 --> 01:15:46.397]  Because I want those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it.
[01:15:46.397 --> 01:15:49.719]  And I want new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us.
[01:15:49.719 --> 01:15:54.061]  And then try regular crenel oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[01:15:54.061 --> 01:15:56.623]  This is the highest grade, back in stock, at BulwerStore.com.
[01:15:57.348 --> 01:16:01.430]  All that evil men and tyrants seem to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:02.930]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:04.231]  I'm trying to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:09.313]  And I've seen huge effects of what we've done here at InfoWars.
[01:16:09.313 --> 01:16:11.034]  Other good men and women getting together.
[01:16:11.838 --> 01:16:14.300]  And telling the truth and standing up to corruption.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.021]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:20.644]  And so I need your prayers, I need your financial support, and I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight.

[01:16:59.764 --> 01:17:02.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:18.326 --> 01:17:19.747]  Alright, John Pierce is with us.
[01:17:19.747 --> 01:17:23.450]  He's a prominent, well-known, respected lawyer, veteran.
[01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:32.077]  He's founded NCLU, National Constitutional Law Union, after he saw what happened to George Papadopoulos and the attempts to set him up as a Russian agent.
[01:17:32.077 --> 01:17:34.518]  For the time we have left, I wanted to put out the big picture for folks.
[01:17:34.518 --> 01:17:40.303]  Now, zooming in on the victims of what happened
[01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:45.408]  We've got these unindicted co-conspirators, the Tuckers, on to do.
[01:17:45.408 --> 01:17:46.528]  I want to talk about that with you, sir.
[01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:53.950]  But getting back to, not the specifics of your clients and their cases, but just in general, what you're witnessing in and around this event.
[01:17:53.950 --> 01:18:03.952]  No charges for all the Antifa people, or charges dropped, including burning down police stations, hitting people with clubs and hatchets, throwing Molotov cocktails.
[01:18:04.732 --> 01:18:05.593]  On police.
[01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:11.917]  That stuff's all been dropped, or has been dropped, but the book's been thrown at people that walk through velvet robes.
[01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:12.678]  Can you speak to that?
[01:18:14.053 --> 01:18:18.576]  Yeah, that's very, very concerning from a selective prosecution standpoint.
[01:18:18.576 --> 01:18:28.964]  I mean, I think that, you know, what you're seeing, and all Americans are seeing this, is that it appears that we have two systems of justice in this country at this point.
[01:18:28.964 --> 01:18:41.973]  It's in direct violation of essentially one of the master principles of the American idea and the American system, which is equal application of the laws, neutral treatment before the laws, regardless of immutable characteristics or political viewpoints.
[01:18:42.373 --> 01:18:53.321]  And so what many Americans are extremely concerned with is you have these very, very serious charges that could carry decades in prison with respect to the folks who showed up at the United States Capitol that day.
[01:18:53.321 --> 01:19:02.888]  And then you do not see that same effort, the same degree of resources, the same predawn raids with respect to folks who are burning down Kenosha, Wisconsin and Portland.
[01:19:03.488 --> 01:19:12.294]  Uh, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, with these autonomous zones, and I would argue, you know, that that kind of thing was the true insurrection.
[01:19:12.294 --> 01:19:28.185]  You know, one thing I want to say about this insurrection narrative, and the left is very good, perhaps better than us, at using language to further their political agenda, you know, it is just false to be describing this as January 6th as some sort of insurrection or sedition.
[01:19:28.185 --> 01:19:32.428]  There are no charges against anyone for insurrection or sedition.
[01:19:33.008 --> 01:19:34.209]  Those are crimes.
[01:19:34.209 --> 01:19:44.017]  If the federal government believed that the elements of those crimes were satisfied, you can be sure that those crimes would have been charged.
[01:19:44.017 --> 01:19:57.407]  And generally speaking, I also want to say about January 6th, in general, with respect to the folks who showed up in Washington, D.C., not necessarily the folks who went to the Capitol, but the folks who generally showed up in Washington, D.C., they were there
[01:19:58.027 --> 01:20:05.958]  To legitimately petition their government for redress of grievances under the First Amendment.
[01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:09.763]  They felt that the election in November was stolen from them.
[01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.826]  They felt that they were cheated.
[01:20:11.826 --> 01:20:14.970]  They felt that no one was doing anything about it.
[01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:22.694]  And that includes, mind you, and I think, like me, you have no love lost sometimes for the Republican establishment.
[01:20:22.694 --> 01:20:30.079]  I think that a lot of state legislatures, including Republican-controlled state legislatures, dropped the ball, did not do their job.
[01:20:30.079 --> 01:20:43.026]  What they should have done was refuse to certify the elections in their states, and that would have not allowed Joe Biden to receive 270 electoral votes, and it would have been kicked to the House under the 12th Amendment.
[01:20:43.366 --> 01:20:50.229]  That would have been the proper constitutional way to handle this to make sure there was some legitimacy in this election.
[01:20:50.229 --> 01:21:00.614]  We're starting to see reports even in Politico that they're going to have to drop a lot of these charges and things because there's just no evidence of what they've even charged them with in many of the cases.
[01:21:00.614 --> 01:21:11.740]  I know you can't get into your clients specifically, but what can you say about that and then the treatment of the solitary confinement and the locking them in the bottom of this jail and people having their eyes beaten out reportedly?
[01:21:13.946 --> 01:21:25.299]  Yeah, so first of all, with respect to evidence, just like you and the rest of the public, myself and defense counsel are waiting to see the evidence.
[01:21:25.299 --> 01:21:34.450]  There is some discovery, some evidence specific to particular cases that is dripping out bit by bit, but in terms of what we really need to see,
[01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:39.671]  You know, we need to see those 15,000 hours of video that were taken at the Capitol.
[01:21:39.671 --> 01:21:41.592]  We need to see every single second of it.
[01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:44.613]  We need to see exactly what happened at the Capitol that day.
[01:21:44.613 --> 01:21:51.795]  I can tell you with respect to all of my clients, our defendants, we are taking every single one of those cases to trial.
[01:21:51.795 --> 01:22:01.418]  We intend to seek full acquittals and I believe that is candidly the only way that we're going to expose the truth of what actually happened on January 6th.
[01:22:01.418 --> 01:22:02.118]  With respect to
[01:22:05.478 --> 01:22:07.220]  We are very concerned.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:17.307]  I have two clients, well it's growing now, but at least two clients as we speak who are detained, actually three or four, and we are very concerned.
[01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:19.369]  So one of them is Christopher Worrell.
[01:22:19.369 --> 01:22:20.450]  He's from Florida.
[01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:22.251]  He has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[01:22:22.251 --> 01:22:23.392]  It's getting worse by the day.
[01:22:23.392 --> 01:22:26.435]  He contracted COVID while he was in jail.
[01:22:26.435 --> 01:22:28.396]  He has not been allowed to see his oncologist.
[01:22:28.396 --> 01:22:31.639]  He has not been allowed to receive the cancer treatment that was
[01:22:32.079 --> 01:22:32.319]  Wow.
[01:22:32.319 --> 01:22:34.780]  So that's your client that happened to?
[01:22:58.085 --> 01:23:00.407]  That is now my client, that's right.
[01:23:00.407 --> 01:23:04.089]  And so, you know, he needs treatment, you know, like now.
[01:23:04.089 --> 01:23:11.574]  His situation is such that if he doesn't get MRIs, if he doesn't get surgery, you know, he's going to be more and more crippled for life.
[01:23:11.574 --> 01:23:20.060]  You know, I have another client who has, you know, 95% kidney failure, who needs dialysis and is not receiving dialysis.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.761]  There is a very real possibility that
[01:23:22.621 --> 01:23:24.703]  One or more of these individuals could die.
[01:23:24.703 --> 01:23:28.566]  Pre-trial, while they're awaiting a trial, you know, being detained.
[01:23:28.566 --> 01:23:31.468]  It's very concerning.
[01:23:39.694 --> 01:23:43.839]  That the guards, predominantly black, actually believe these are white supremacists they're beating.
[01:23:43.839 --> 01:23:55.213]  So, they're believing the narrative of the Attorney General and others that have called them all white supremacists, which white supremacists don't deserve to be beaten, but the point is, they're demonizing them, and so that's part of the reason they're being assaulted.
[01:23:56.627 --> 01:24:04.235]  Well, I just took over that case, so whatever you would have seen in terms of a transcript would have been a different lawyer.
[01:24:04.235 --> 01:24:10.000]  I can't speak first-hand to precisely what is occurring inside the facilities.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.103]  Obviously, I hear things.
[01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:14.124]  Sure.
[01:24:14.124 --> 01:24:15.365]  Well, John Pierce, I know you've got to go.
[01:24:15.365 --> 01:24:19.646]  I want to get you back up with other updates every week or so as this unfolds.
[01:24:19.646 --> 01:24:21.347]  NCLU.com.
[01:24:21.347 --> 01:24:26.169]  I appreciate you stepping up with other lawyers to do this and helping all these people out.
[01:24:26.169 --> 01:24:27.369]  So God bless you.
[01:24:27.369 --> 01:24:29.550]  In a minute and a half, other points you want to impart to the viewers.
[01:24:31.084 --> 01:24:35.046]  Yeah, the most important thing, Alex, is we need help with the NCLU.
[01:24:35.046 --> 01:24:41.370]  Anything anyone can do, you know, small dollar donations, big dollar donations, volunteer, have lawyers reach out.
[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:45.812]  If folks or clients that need legal help, you know, reach out to us.
[01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:53.677]  You know, this is the ACLU of the future and of right now, except we're actually going to protect everyone's constitutional rights.
[01:24:53.957 --> 01:24:56.919]  And I want to be clear that this is not a Republican organization.
[01:24:56.919 --> 01:24:58.540]  This is not a conservative organization.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:05.204]  You know, I myself, of course, am an American-first, conservative, populist, you know, person.
[01:25:05.204 --> 01:25:14.409]  But the reason that we have a Constitution that lasts for decades and generations, if we save it this time, is that we fight for everyone's constitutional rights.
[01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:16.030]  And that's what we're going to do.
[01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:17.331]  Finally, you know, I would like to say
[01:25:17.891 --> 01:25:23.460]  What I think is very important in the country right now, first of all, everyone needs to get off the sidelines and help.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.442]  It's go time.
[01:25:24.442 --> 01:25:25.403]  We're in a fourth turning.
[01:25:25.403 --> 01:25:26.184]  This is a crisis.
[01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:27.486]  We need everyone's help.
[01:25:27.486 --> 01:25:32.675]  But I think two things that we need to do as a country are, number one, we have to return to our founding principles.
[01:25:32.955 --> 01:25:40.724]  We have to return to limited government, a federal government of enumerated powers that's very limited with everything reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment.
[01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:42.906]  Finally, we need to return to God.
[01:25:42.906 --> 01:25:50.274]  No matter what the Constitution says, if we do not have a virtuous citizenry and a moral people, you know, we're in real trouble.
[01:25:50.274 --> 01:25:51.736]  So that's what I agree with Alex.
[01:25:51.736 --> 01:25:52.757]  I totally agree.
[01:25:52.757 --> 01:25:53.478]  Thank you so much.
[01:25:53.478 --> 01:25:53.938]  God bless you.
[01:25:53.938 --> 01:25:54.479]  Have a good weekend.
[01:25:56.827 --> 01:26:00.592]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[01:26:00.592 --> 01:26:03.736]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:11.931]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:17.692]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local states you're listening to as well.
[01:26:17.692 --> 01:26:29.294]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[01:26:29.914 --> 01:26:32.056]  I need your help more than ever now.
[01:26:32.056 --> 01:26:36.179]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[01:26:36.179 --> 01:26:46.787]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:26:56.314 --> 01:26:56.975]  Thank you so much.

[01:27:58.614 --> 01:28:02.255]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:28:02.255 --> 01:28:04.896]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[01:28:04.896 --> 01:28:15.839]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:20.080]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.161]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[01:28:25.161 --> 01:28:26.882]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:32.505]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[01:28:32.505 --> 01:28:34.106]  It's essential in the body.
[01:28:34.106 --> 01:28:36.587]  Well, we have our amazing Tri-Iodine.
[01:28:36.587 --> 01:28:41.270]  A big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:46.893]  That is, Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[01:28:46.893 --> 01:28:52.997]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[01:28:53.337 --> 01:28:54.600]  You and your family will love it.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.642]  It's incredible for your body.
[01:28:55.642 --> 01:29:00.070]  Get it at InfoWareStore.com today.
[01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:02.674]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:29:32.398 --> 01:29:34.079]  All right, it's Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:35.160]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.623]  We reached the halfway point of the broadcast that I'm hosting.
[01:29:39.623 --> 01:29:50.370]  We have a great guest host in the fourth hour ahead of what's going to be unfolding with Owen Schroyer and the War Room coming up.
[01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:54.852]  You'll definitely want to tune in to the broadcast this weekend and on Sunday and on Monday.
[01:29:54.852 --> 01:30:01.717]  I am going to be in New York City and we're going to be there on some special missions of justice and freedom.
[01:30:02.933 --> 01:30:07.035]  So that is all coming up as well.
[01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:18.960]  But I want to open the phones up before Max Keiser joins us in the last 30 minutes of the next hour on the inflationary numbers coming out that are so serious.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:27.044]  And then we also have Stu Peters hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:30:27.044 --> 01:30:32.226]  And then, of course, we also just had John Pierce on with the important work
[01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:37.226]  That John is doing.
[01:30:37.226 --> 01:30:39.969]  You see all this news I've got in front of me of your TV viewer.
[01:30:39.969 --> 01:30:41.571]  I've got a couple hundred articles here.
[01:30:41.571 --> 01:30:42.252]  They're all important.
[01:30:42.252 --> 01:30:45.776]  They're all insanely over the top.
[01:30:45.776 --> 01:30:52.024]  But if you don't realize that we have megabanks and megacorporations that have a unified global
[01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:57.852]  anti-human agenda, and that they have a plan, none of this makes sense.
[01:30:57.852 --> 01:31:15.920]  But when you understand that, you see the agenda to make things bad, to collapse things, to slowly poison people, and then have the corrupt medical system absorb the people that they've actually poisoned, and then extract all of their wealth out of them while they kill them.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:21.623]  And I've really been heartened by how many tens of thousands of prominent doctors and scientists
[01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:35.699]  And nurses and others have gone public and said COVID's a takeover and really been doing a great job exposing the suppression of totally viable treatments and the rest of it.
[01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:38.461]  But it's not enough.
[01:31:38.461 --> 01:31:49.109]  Because the leadership of the New World Order, the Klaus Schwab's, the Bill Gates's, and the Prince Charles's of the world,
[01:31:51.198 --> 01:31:56.920]  They are not worried about ever being held accountable for the depopulation operation they're carrying out against us.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:15.646]  So at the end of the day, I'm infuriated with Frank Figliuzzi, just a dirty, corrupt, evil Democrat lawyer, on TV at the FBI saying we're going to wage war against Congress with anti-terrorism tactics because they're radicalizing people.
[01:32:15.646 --> 01:32:18.347]  Oh, we're going to kill this imam because he's radicalizing people.
[01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:22.363]  I mean, those are declarations of war.
[01:32:22.363 --> 01:32:25.905]  But that guy is like dog manure.
[01:32:25.905 --> 01:32:28.166]  I don't want to run out in the field and stomp on it and attack it.
[01:32:28.166 --> 01:32:29.447]  I want it to stay away from me.
[01:32:29.447 --> 01:32:33.109]  Now get that clip ready again.
[01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:37.671]  But I want you to understand, that is them externalizing their operation against us.
[01:32:37.671 --> 01:32:42.233]  So, they're really going to make this move.
[01:32:42.233 --> 01:32:43.173]  They're doing it now.
[01:32:43.173 --> 01:32:44.414]  And it makes me sick to my stomach.
[01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:52.689]  I just want to be happy and live my life and go to the national parks and go drive around on a motorboat and eat enchiladas.
[01:32:52.689 --> 01:32:58.371]  But there's a bunch of creepy, weird dudes that want to run the world, and they're not going to stop.
[01:32:58.371 --> 01:33:00.892]  I mean, these are sickos, man.
[01:33:00.892 --> 01:33:13.597]  And I can tell you, I was told this by Ted Gunnarsson, who was a good FBI agent, and I was told this by Benton Parton, who was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, and I was told this by General Stubblebine, who was the head of all special forces.
[01:33:14.341 --> 01:33:28.608]  And I was told this by all these old-timers, and I didn't think they were crazy, because they were dead-on about the history I knew, but they all told me it was a bunch of devil-worshiping pedophiles at the top.
[01:33:28.608 --> 01:33:31.969]  And it turns out they were.
[01:33:31.969 --> 01:33:39.553]  That's who was on the top, and General Stubblebine and General Parton and Ted Gunnarsson all told me the truth.
[01:33:42.026 --> 01:33:57.614]  In fact, I got chills a couple years ago when the FBI released, because of the statute of limitations and because of the declassification laws, 30-year-old documents from the Finders case, and 40-year-old documents.
[01:33:57.614 --> 01:34:04.017]  And I was reading, there was over a thousand pages of it, and I was just scanning through it for a couple hours, and I was physically getting nauseous.
[01:34:05.962 --> 01:34:14.626]  Because I was having flashbacks to Ted Gunderson on my show and other shows and big speeches he gave across the country.
[01:34:14.626 --> 01:34:19.308]  And I was sitting there, reading it, and this was stuff he told me.
[01:34:19.308 --> 01:34:25.251]  And this was the FBI reports and all of it, and the confirmation of the CIA child kidnapping, and just all of it.
[01:34:25.251 --> 01:34:29.152]  And look, there are plenty of Ted Gundersons still in the FBI.
[01:34:29.152 --> 01:34:33.154]  There are plenty of General Partons still in the military, but they're not at the top of it.
[01:34:35.214 --> 01:34:41.258]  And so I know it's scary to know we got a bunch of pedophile devil worshippers running stuff, but that's just the way it is.
[01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:45.140]  The Bible told us that happens.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:51.984]  And so we just have to say no to these people, and we have to stand up against them and speak out against them.
[01:34:51.984 --> 01:34:54.206]  And we've got to be smart, too.
[01:34:54.206 --> 01:34:59.609]  We need more rallies around the nation saying we don't buy open borders and globalism and election fraud.
[01:34:59.609 --> 01:35:02.130]  And we've done a great job not being violent in the past.
[01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:04.752]  We got set up on January 6th because we got too confident.
[01:35:07.225 --> 01:35:22.197]  But we just really have to get aggressive, just like the lawyer we had on earlier, who had a big private practice doing very, very well, but decided to do this because he's drawn to it because he's a veteran and he sees what's happening to the country.
[01:35:22.197 --> 01:35:28.402]  And so I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit the latest COVID news and this Chinese defector and just the incredible nature of it.
[01:35:28.402 --> 01:35:32.385]  It all just gets more insane each chapter, each day as we go here.
[01:35:32.385 --> 01:35:33.506]  And then I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:35:34.801 --> 01:35:43.128]  For first-time callers, any subjects you want to discuss, but obviously, what do you think of the declaration of war against the American people by the Deep State?
[01:35:43.128 --> 01:35:46.651]  What do you think about all the Wuhan news coming out and the wheels coming off?
[01:35:46.651 --> 01:35:52.696]  What do you make of the horrible job Biden's doing and how he can hardly talk now and how long can this farce go?
[01:35:52.696 --> 01:35:56.960]  And how do we wake the country up and say no to this plan without it becoming violent?
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.241]  Because we don't want it to be violent.
[01:35:58.241 --> 01:36:00.623]  We're going to win the midterms.
[01:36:00.623 --> 01:36:02.185]  We're going to take things back peacefully.
[01:36:02.185 --> 01:36:02.565]  They're not.
[01:36:03.848 --> 01:36:05.129]  They're not going to let us do that.
[01:36:05.129 --> 01:36:07.150]  They're going to stage events and blame us for it.
[01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:08.731]  They're already prepping everybody.
[01:36:08.731 --> 01:36:10.673]  This is not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:36:10.673 --> 01:36:12.674]  This is a fact.
[01:36:12.674 --> 01:36:15.936]  Prima facie, right there.
[01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:22.601]  And so, they want a war with us because they think they're going to have a war between the police and the military and the American people.
[01:36:22.601 --> 01:36:27.184]  And they think they're going to sit back and then watch us all kill each other.
[01:36:27.184 --> 01:36:28.865]  How do we circumvent that?
[01:36:28.865 --> 01:36:29.906]  How do we not go there?
[01:36:30.652 --> 01:36:32.013]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:36:32.013 --> 01:36:32.254]  877-789-Alex.
[01:36:32.254 --> 01:36:32.414]  877-789-Alex.
[01:36:32.414 --> 01:36:32.474]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:32.474 --> 01:36:33.615]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[01:36:33.615 --> 01:36:34.856]  I really want to hear from you.
[01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:35.376]  I respect your views.
[01:36:35.376 --> 01:36:36.257]  I want to understand what you
[01:36:52.924 --> 01:37:01.246]  are concerned about and just where we go because I just have this burning desire to expose this, this burning desire to expose what's happening and try to stop it.
[01:37:01.246 --> 01:37:05.708]  That's why I'm going to have a bunch of huge guests that we start taping with today.
[01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:09.689]  Probably going to be a five-hour, basically commercial-free.
[01:37:09.689 --> 01:37:10.949]  We'll take a few breaks.
[01:37:10.949 --> 01:37:13.950]  It's not going to be commercials for stations.
[01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:16.611]  That'll be sent out at 2 p.m.
[01:37:16.611 --> 01:37:17.371]  tomorrow.
[01:37:17.371 --> 01:37:20.352]  It'll go out, taped to air like it's live, teleprompter-free.
[01:37:21.847 --> 01:37:26.370]  And it's going to be Dr. Steve Pacinic will make his return.
[01:37:26.370 --> 01:37:28.931]  We're going to have Robert Barnes.
[01:37:28.931 --> 01:37:34.674]  We're going to have, just like the constitutional lawyer you just heard from, people like that.
[01:37:34.674 --> 01:37:41.818]  We've got a bunch of big guests that we're not going to announce until they're done and it's taped and it's ready.
[01:37:41.818 --> 01:37:47.001]  But you heard the big revolver journalist on with the rest of the story.
[01:37:47.001 --> 01:37:50.283]  It's going to be four or five hours of that.
[01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:57.647]  That we will have ready to go on air with tomorrow at 2 p.m.
[01:37:57.647 --> 01:38:00.468]  Central Standard Time.
[01:38:00.468 --> 01:38:03.510]  So to the crew in there, that's the airtime tomorrow, 2 p.m.
[01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:08.092]  Central Standard Time.
[01:38:08.092 --> 01:38:11.053]  And we're going to be putting that report out.
[01:38:11.053 --> 01:38:19.877]  I had Nick Fuentes and others on, some of the former political prisoners, like Pete Santilli,
[01:38:21.181 --> 01:38:24.223]  It was a treasure trove of experience and knowledge.
[01:38:24.223 --> 01:38:24.843]  He's been through it.
[01:38:24.843 --> 01:38:27.605]  I was saying, we need to get Tucker Carlson to go public.
[01:38:27.605 --> 01:38:29.486]  We need to get everybody to expose what's happening.
[01:38:29.486 --> 01:38:37.830]  We need a big expose to show FBI's history and involvement in January 6th.
[01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.072]  Of course, I knew what was already cooking, what was coming.
[01:38:40.072 --> 01:38:41.813]  So that was really a prelude to that.
[01:38:41.813 --> 01:38:45.515]  I'm going to give you a prelude to what's going to break next week.
[01:38:45.515 --> 01:38:47.216]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:38:47.216 --> 01:38:48.176]  That is coming up.
[01:38:48.176 --> 01:38:49.277]  We'll be right back to your phone calls.
[01:38:55.624 --> 01:39:07.668]  In the last 16 months, InfoWars researchers have been hard at work developing the ultimate, high-quality, affordable systems to boost your body's natural defenses and make you have an overall healthier, happier life.
[01:39:07.668 --> 01:39:10.769]  And we now have them available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:10.769 --> 01:39:14.191]  Get all three of these formulas together for 40% off or individually, 25% off.
[01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:20.736]  We have the Whole Food Multi-Vitamin System, 25% off introductory price.
[01:39:20.736 --> 01:39:26.301]  We have the InfoWars Life Vitamin C Plus Zinc, 1100% of your daily allowance, just of the C alone.
[01:39:26.301 --> 01:39:27.702]  Research what that's about.
[01:39:27.702 --> 01:39:30.745]  Linus Pauling won a Nobel Prize for it, 25% off.
[01:39:30.745 --> 01:39:34.748]  And then, Vitamin D3 Plus Calcium Gummies, 25% off as well.
[01:39:34.748 --> 01:39:38.812]  All three together, 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:39.292 --> 01:39:43.677]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:39:59.654 --> 01:40:01.178]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[01:40:01.178 --> 01:40:02.481]  I'm trying to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:40:02.481 --> 01:40:07.573]  And I've seen huge effects with what we've done here at InfoWars.
[01:40:07.573 --> 01:40:09.297]  Other good men and women getting together.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.541]  And tell them the truth that's standing up to corruption.
[01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:14.402]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[01:40:14.402 --> 01:40:18.885]  And so I need your prayers, I need your financial support, I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight.
[01:40:18.885 --> 01:40:21.126]  We've got a big sale going right now.
[01:40:21.126 --> 01:40:24.248]  Free shipping, double patriot points on three items that have been sold out.
[01:40:24.248 --> 01:40:26.289]  Ultimate Grill Oil, 40% off.
[01:40:26.289 --> 01:40:27.089]  X3, 60% off.
[01:40:27.089 --> 01:40:28.850]  Best deal ever on that.
[01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:33.873]  And of course, bio through selenium that is essential for every action of every cell in your body.
[01:40:34.353 --> 01:40:35.453]  It's crazy to get to this point.
[01:40:35.453 --> 01:40:36.754]  It's very bittersweet.
[01:40:36.754 --> 01:40:39.655]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.041]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[01:41:05.041 --> 01:41:05.981]  But I don't care about that.
[01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:08.022]  I care about beating the New World Order.
[01:41:08.022 --> 01:41:12.725]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[01:41:12.725 --> 01:41:16.086]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[01:41:16.086 --> 01:41:17.587]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[01:41:17.587 --> 01:41:18.788]  But let's just say this.
[01:41:18.788 --> 01:41:20.109]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:22.570]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:26.831]  So, please pray for us and please buy the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:27.891]  They're great products.
[01:41:27.891 --> 01:41:29.412]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[01:41:29.412 --> 01:41:32.593]  So, you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[01:41:32.593 --> 01:41:33.453]  Do they fund freedom?
[01:41:33.453 --> 01:41:34.553]  No, a lot of them don't.
[01:41:34.553 --> 01:41:41.015]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[01:41:41.015 --> 01:41:42.735]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[01:41:42.735 --> 01:41:45.556]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[01:41:46.136 --> 01:41:49.278]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[01:41:49.278 --> 01:41:51.800]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.764]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[01:41:56.764 --> 01:42:00.546]  People pat me on the back all the time and I really, really appreciate it.
[01:42:00.546 --> 01:42:01.947]  But I want you to understand something.
[01:42:01.947 --> 01:42:04.709]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here.
[01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:08.312]  Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here.
[01:42:09.032 --> 01:42:18.837]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't spreading the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore, and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the New World Order like we have right now.
[01:42:18.837 --> 01:42:29.382]  So, now more than ever, please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get great products that make you and your family's lives better, and that fund the InfoWar that fights tyranny that also makes your lives better.
[01:42:29.382 --> 01:42:34.345]  A lot of people are counting on InfoWars to stay on the air, so I'm counting on you to keep us on the air.
[01:42:34.745 --> 01:42:36.886]  We're going to defeat the globalists, but it's not going to happen easy.
[01:42:36.886 --> 01:42:38.206]  We need God on our side.
[01:42:38.206 --> 01:42:39.367]  We've got to take action.
[01:42:39.367 --> 01:42:41.908]  Three of our best-selling products are back in stock.

[01:42:59.634 --> 01:43:02.295]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:37.741]  The beast in me Is caged by frail and fragile bars Restless by day and by night Rants and rages at the stars God help
[01:43:39.335 --> 01:43:49.797]  Alright, I'm going to start going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:43:49.797 --> 01:43:57.999]  I want to get this news from the COVID file.
[01:43:57.999 --> 01:44:05.881]  But it's just really painful to see the federal government seized by globalists, seized by foreign interests that had bought the government off, bought the country off.
[01:44:06.494 --> 01:44:18.159]  We put a president in to try to stand up for the nation, try to do the best job he could, they removed him through fraud, and now they think they'll just start a civil war to get control of the rest of the country that won't submit to him.
[01:44:18.159 --> 01:44:27.584]  And to watch these occupiers dismantle the country in front of us with every level of classical tyranny.
[01:44:27.584 --> 01:44:30.305]  I mean, everything's like cartoon level.
[01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:32.906]  Everything's like exaggerated, flagrant,
[01:44:34.418 --> 01:44:41.420]  Living color, way worse than it's ever been anywhere else, except for the mass arrests and mass killing.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:53.502]  And then now they're announcing they want that, and Frank Figliuzzi and all of them are on TV saying, our opposition are terrorists, anyone radicalizing anyone, anyone questioning an election is a terrorist.
[01:44:53.502 --> 01:44:57.203]  We're going to get you, we're going to interdict you, we're going to take members of Congress up.
[01:45:00.891 --> 01:45:03.973]  And then of course there's a suspicious object, the CIA headquarters.
[01:45:03.973 --> 01:45:08.477]  They can all freak out and panic.
[01:45:08.477 --> 01:45:12.940]  It's the intelligence agencies taking the country over.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:17.224]  And if we can't get control of them, this nation's a joke.
[01:45:17.224 --> 01:45:20.947]  And by the way, China and Russia know we're a joke.
[01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:23.068]  They can only bully Americans.
[01:45:23.068 --> 01:45:26.811]  They can't stand up to any real foreign powers.
[01:45:26.811 --> 01:45:30.454]  It's banana boat garbage.
[01:45:34.178 --> 01:45:38.101]  That's what it is.
[01:45:38.101 --> 01:45:44.785]  In fact, you know, I mentioned it, but the Big Lee Izzy thing is so big, I'm just going to play it again, because it blew the judge away when I had Judge Joe Brown here.
[01:45:44.785 --> 01:45:49.408]  We can have it go as well, because it's so seismic.
[01:45:49.408 --> 01:45:59.675]  And the whole clip, he goes on, you know, just to declare war on America, and that questioning them is radicalization, and the penalty for radicalization is death.
[01:45:59.675 --> 01:46:02.477]  So when you know the nomenclature, the terms used by the military,
[01:46:03.492 --> 01:46:08.435]  And then you have the new national threat response package.
[01:46:08.435 --> 01:46:14.159]  You have the statements by the CIA and FBI that indeed their new mission is fighting us.
[01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:27.327]  We pay their paycheck, they open our borders, they smuggle children, they devalue the currency, they protect the pedophile rings, they do all this and then we're the enemy because we don't love it.
[01:46:27.327 --> 01:46:32.670]  We don't love what the sellout lawyers did to this weird consortium of criminals that run the country.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:45.562]  White supremacy, most lethal threat to America, Biden says, and you've got the Secretary of Defense tweeting out the communist black power symbol.
[01:46:45.562 --> 01:46:47.783]  Imagine if a white guy put a white power symbol out.
[01:46:47.783 --> 01:46:48.263]  What does that mean?
[01:46:48.263 --> 01:46:51.043]  It's supposed to just be a red, white and blue fist.
[01:46:51.043 --> 01:46:59.685]  But no, it's the communist fist on the Secretary of Defense's site, because that's what it's all about, is division and tribalism and the breakup of the country.
[01:46:59.685 --> 01:47:05.887]  And that's why he was put in position of power, because he and General Honore said they would do that and would wage war against America.
[01:47:09.152 --> 01:47:10.813]  It's just crazy.
[01:47:10.813 --> 01:47:13.935]  It's like Biden looks like a crazy dictator in his sunglasses.
[01:47:13.935 --> 01:47:15.436]  Looks like Gaddafi.
[01:47:15.436 --> 01:47:16.997]  That's the same thing with the new Secretary of Defense.
[01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:20.299]  I mean, he looks like a crazy dictator.
[01:47:20.299 --> 01:47:22.140]  Not because he's black, he just has that look.
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.642]  Like Biden has the look of a thug.
[01:47:24.642 --> 01:47:26.983]  But then the actions are what matters.
[01:47:26.983 --> 01:47:29.344]  Here's that clip again.
[01:47:29.344 --> 01:47:34.828]  In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle
[01:47:35.541 --> 01:47:38.362]  And I guess I can play a two-minute compilation of Saki and
[01:48:03.431 --> 01:48:05.072]  Biden and all of us saying the same thing.
[01:48:05.072 --> 01:48:12.454]  It's just, you already know what's happening.
[01:48:12.454 --> 01:48:18.575]  Oh yeah, it's not just a black power fist, it's an Africa fist.
[01:48:18.575 --> 01:48:27.098]  When the globalists are massively engaged in all sorts of enslavement in Africa right now, not a word out of him about Apple and slave factories in China.
[01:48:27.098 --> 01:48:27.198]  No.
[01:48:30.129 --> 01:48:34.230]  It's like, hey, we're criminals, we're the government, and we love black people, so we can do whatever we want.
[01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:38.271]  It has nothing to do with reality.
[01:48:38.271 --> 01:48:38.611]  You know what?
[01:48:38.611 --> 01:48:46.333]  I'm going to hit the COVID news with Max Keiser, and I'll tie that into the other big news.
[01:48:46.333 --> 01:48:51.115]  And then I'll also hit a lot of this news that's breaking tomorrow during this four or five hour special I'm going to tape.
[01:48:51.115 --> 01:48:51.975]  That's going to air at 2 p.m.
[01:48:51.975 --> 01:48:52.275]  Central.
[01:48:52.275 --> 01:48:52.715]  But right now,
[01:48:55.566 --> 01:48:58.189]  Just briefly, it ends on Monday morning.
[01:48:58.189 --> 01:49:04.895]  It is the vitamin C with the zinc and the rose hips that you cannot do better for your immune system and your body.
[01:49:04.895 --> 01:49:07.618]  It's 1100% of the vitamin C you need.
[01:49:07.618 --> 01:49:12.363]  It's almost 200% of the zinc you need and the rose hips are amazing as well.
[01:49:12.363 --> 01:49:13.284]  It's all in there.
[01:49:13.284 --> 01:49:16.347]  It's the Linus Pauling recipe that he won the Nobel Prize for basically.
[01:49:17.086 --> 01:49:18.947]  And it's at a very low price for what you're getting.
[01:49:18.947 --> 01:49:24.651]  You also have a whole food vitamin, and it's from Whole Foods, multivitamin, and you have the vitamin D3 with calcium.
[01:49:24.651 --> 01:49:26.552]  It's good for adults and children.
[01:49:26.552 --> 01:49:28.974]  That's all 40% off, free shipping, double patriot points.
[01:49:28.974 --> 01:49:29.995]  That ends Monday.
[01:49:29.995 --> 01:49:34.738]  And then you've got the X3 back in stock, Tri-Iodine, 60% off.
[01:49:34.738 --> 01:49:40.121]  I want you to experience what it does for your libido, your stamina, your energy, your cells, your immune system.
[01:49:40.121 --> 01:49:41.042]  It's essential.
[01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:42.203]  Tri-Iodine.
[01:49:42.203 --> 01:49:43.764]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:49:43.764 --> 01:49:44.664]  X3.
[01:49:44.664 --> 01:49:45.325]  And then we have the...
[01:49:46.105 --> 01:49:48.566]  Very close to selling out of the current prices.
[01:49:48.566 --> 01:49:51.267]  Ultimate Krill Oil, so good for your body.
[01:49:51.267 --> 01:49:52.288]  40% off.
[01:49:52.288 --> 01:49:55.529]  And then in Bio-Tristhelinium, 50% off.
[01:49:55.529 --> 01:50:01.291]  Okay, we're going to be talking to Aaron, Charles, Kevin, Keith, Matthew, Steve.
[01:50:01.291 --> 01:50:04.212]  I hope we tried to call back any of the folks that were still on hold yesterday.
[01:50:04.212 --> 01:50:07.134]  Simon, Dishwan, and others.
[01:50:07.134 --> 01:50:10.395]  Who's been holding longest here?
[01:50:10.395 --> 01:50:13.076]  That would be Matthew in Florida.
[01:50:13.826 --> 01:50:16.148]  Avoiding the Deep State false flags.
[01:50:16.148 --> 01:50:17.189]  Exposing their traps.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:18.069]  How do we do that, Matthew?
[01:50:18.069 --> 01:50:21.431]  Hey Alex, this is Mr. Foote.
[01:50:21.431 --> 01:50:23.213]  I'm not Matthew in Florida.
[01:50:23.213 --> 01:50:26.295]  I had to lie to the, uh, to get on.
[01:50:26.295 --> 01:50:28.677]  I just want to start out with- Let's stop you right there.
[01:50:28.677 --> 01:50:31.999]  Let's just stop you right there.
[01:50:31.999 --> 01:50:36.822]  We don't screen the phone calls other than you having a clean phone line and having your point you want to make.
[01:50:36.822 --> 01:50:42.586]  So, uh, why would you have to lie and say your name is Matthew instead of what?
[01:50:42.586 --> 01:50:43.387]  Mr. Foote.
[01:50:44.324 --> 01:50:45.345]  This is Mr. Foote.
[01:50:45.345 --> 01:50:49.248]  Okay, Mr. Foote, go ahead and make your point, but I'm not going to indulge in this very long.
[01:50:49.248 --> 01:50:50.369]  Go ahead.
[01:50:50.369 --> 01:50:51.551]  Okay.
[01:50:51.551 --> 01:51:03.862]  Anyway, I just wanted to start out with a quick plug and say that InfoWars Store has t-shirts and that they sell for a price and can be bought online.
[01:51:03.862 --> 01:51:06.124]  And I wanted to say that really,
[01:51:07.248 --> 01:51:16.910]  Everything just fell apart for you and this, because you're missing one thing, and that thing is a foil.
[01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:20.911]  But your foil needs to be real.
[01:51:20.911 --> 01:51:24.132]  Somebody that you can face.
[01:51:24.132 --> 01:51:26.713]  This sounds like a bunch of riddle stuff, man.
[01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:27.473]  I'm not the riddler.
[01:51:27.473 --> 01:51:28.293]  I appreciate your call.
[01:51:28.293 --> 01:51:29.393]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:51:29.393 --> 01:51:30.454]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:51:30.454 --> 01:51:32.354]  Other than you got a clean phone line, you got something to say.
[01:51:33.146 --> 01:51:38.149]  I'm not going to, but liberals, they want to play weird games and like act like they're smarter than everybody.
[01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:41.512]  I don't, if I don't understand what you're saying, I'm going to hang up on you.
[01:51:41.512 --> 01:51:41.652]  Okay.
[01:51:41.652 --> 01:51:44.153]  Cause I mean, it sounded like a bunch of gibberish to me.
[01:51:44.153 --> 01:51:44.514]  Okay.
[01:51:44.514 --> 01:51:46.835]  Who's up next here?
[01:51:46.835 --> 01:51:49.577]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in Maryland.
[01:51:49.577 --> 01:51:52.619]  Charles, welcome.
[01:51:52.619 --> 01:51:52.859]  Yeah.
[01:51:52.859 --> 01:51:54.120]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:56.842]  I'm so grateful to have you and everybody.
[01:51:57.506 --> 01:51:58.067]  Thank you, sir.
[01:52:15.092 --> 01:52:20.835]  And my Info Wars Save the Frog shirt came in the mail two days ago.
[01:52:20.835 --> 01:52:25.737]  Well, without you we wouldn't be on the air, sir, so I salute you and I thank you.
[01:52:25.737 --> 01:52:27.558]  What is your take on January 6th?
[01:52:27.558 --> 01:52:31.240]  I see you say that you want to talk about that.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.141]  Yeah, yeah, I do.
[01:52:33.141 --> 01:52:44.126]  There's so many disturbing things in the world right now and I can't get away from it at all, but I would have to say that the number one thing that bothers me more than anything right now
[01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:50.942]  It's those people sitting in jail right now from the fake insurrection on January 6th.
[01:52:50.942 --> 01:52:53.363]  It really, really bothers me.
[01:52:53.363 --> 01:53:00.387]  And we don't have politicians doing nearly enough to get them out and have due process.
[01:53:00.387 --> 01:53:01.388]  Well, that's because D.C.
[01:53:01.388 --> 01:53:04.009]  has its own nightmare judges, its own nightmare system.
[01:53:04.009 --> 01:53:04.810]  And D.C.
[01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:05.590]  is not America.
[01:53:05.590 --> 01:53:05.850]  D.C.
[01:53:05.850 --> 01:53:07.611]  is basically North Korea.
[01:53:07.611 --> 01:53:11.334]  It's a Jiji-Ping's toehold.
[01:53:11.334 --> 01:53:12.534]  Oh yeah, I totally agree.
[01:53:14.133 --> 01:53:17.175]  Probably even worse than North Korea in many ways, you know?
[01:53:17.175 --> 01:53:22.137]  It's like the hub of the whole globalist operation.
[01:53:22.137 --> 01:53:29.761]  But, um, you know, the fact that they're sitting in jail with no due process is just unacceptable.
[01:53:29.761 --> 01:53:30.362]  Stay there.
[01:53:30.362 --> 01:53:31.402]  I'm back in two minutes, Charles.
[01:53:31.402 --> 01:53:39.827]  I'm gonna go right back to you, and then I'm gonna go to Al Killer and everybody else that is patiently holding on this Friday live transmission.
[01:53:39.827 --> 01:53:42.088]  Again, if you disagree with me, just get to it.
[01:53:42.088 --> 01:53:43.109]  I'm not censoring you.
[01:53:45.746 --> 01:53:49.129]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:59.055]  And so, as bad as things are with the globalists attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[01:53:59.055 --> 01:54:02.418]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[01:54:02.418 --> 01:54:13.986]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs, or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood, or mainstream media, or industry, people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[01:54:14.826 --> 01:54:19.489]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[01:54:19.489 --> 01:54:21.550]  Well, that's where InfoWars comes in.
[01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:25.912]  You fund us, you support InfoWarsTour.com, you get great products, you get the same time.
[01:54:25.912 --> 01:54:35.536]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[01:54:35.536 --> 01:54:36.457]  That's our job.
[01:54:36.457 --> 01:54:42.920]  So please, keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can beat the shock groups and the information war.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.182]  Find us at infowarestore.com.
[01:54:47.182 --> 01:54:53.947]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[01:54:53.947 --> 01:54:59.750]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[01:54:59.750 --> 01:55:05.334]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[01:55:05.334 --> 01:55:08.155]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[01:55:08.155 --> 01:55:09.997]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[01:55:10.957 --> 01:55:14.179]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[01:55:14.179 --> 01:55:17.882]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[01:55:17.882 --> 01:55:23.986]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[01:55:23.986 --> 01:55:27.248]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[01:55:27.948 --> 01:55:37.316]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[01:55:37.316 --> 01:55:44.141]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune Support Pack.
[01:55:44.141 --> 01:55:49.646]  Now 40% off.
[01:55:49.646 --> 01:55:52.268]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:05.507 --> 01:56:18.313]  In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.
[01:56:18.313 --> 01:56:19.894]  According to the intelligence community,
[01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:26.414]  Terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today.
[01:56:26.414 --> 01:56:32.798]  Because of this growth in polarization in the United States and domestic violence in white supremacist groups.
[01:56:32.798 --> 01:56:39.402]  So I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed.
[01:56:40.289 --> 01:56:49.335]  Are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas.
[01:56:49.335 --> 01:56:54.438]  The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat.
[01:56:54.438 --> 01:56:58.781]  The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve.
[01:56:58.781 --> 01:57:04.245]  In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and dismantle
[01:57:05.699 --> 01:57:08.401]  The command and control element of a terrorist group.
[01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:14.665]  And unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear, that may mean people sitting in Congress right now.
[01:57:14.665 --> 01:57:17.267]  People in and around the former president.
[01:57:17.267 --> 01:57:18.408]  That's how you do this.
[01:57:18.408 --> 01:57:25.653]  Otherwise, recruitment, inciting, and cult-like leadership continues to recruit people to violence.
[01:57:26.073 --> 01:57:30.015]  Our initial work on DVE will broadly fall into three areas.
[01:57:30.015 --> 01:57:42.021]  The first is a tasking from President Biden sent to the ODNI today, requesting a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism.
[01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:55.648]  You can be darn tootin' that we are focused very, very hard on how can we get better sources, better information, better analysis, so that we can make sure that something like what happened on January 6th never happens again.
[01:57:56.391 --> 01:58:05.119]  You can be darn tootin', the FBI director's gonna make sure we get sold out to China, and the pedophiles, and everything else.
[01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:10.543]  That's their job, is to just hold the position, hold down America while the vampires suck us dry.
[01:58:10.543 --> 01:58:15.808]  The national security apparatus is a straitjacket to keep us tied down while the country is destroyed.
[01:58:15.808 --> 01:58:19.551]  You see it everywhere.
[01:58:19.551 --> 01:58:20.932]  What a group of monsters.
[01:58:20.932 --> 01:58:22.133]  And then imagine that statement.
[01:58:23.141 --> 01:58:23.842]  Out of all of them.
[01:58:23.842 --> 01:58:26.704]  Oh, we got to frustrate these terror networks.
[01:58:26.704 --> 01:58:33.870]  Trump's existence and the people around him and the talk show host and Congress, they've got to be gotten rid of.
[01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:36.833]  Oh, because people want to elect them.
[01:58:36.833 --> 01:58:38.775]  People want to listen to them.
[01:58:38.775 --> 01:58:43.078]  These evil Americans like Alex Jones.
[01:58:43.078 --> 01:58:45.541]  They like Tucker Carlson.
[01:58:45.541 --> 01:58:47.002]  They like President Trump.
[01:58:48.015 --> 01:58:49.736]  They like free market!
[01:58:49.736 --> 01:58:50.997]  They like babies!
[01:58:50.997 --> 01:58:52.338]  They like guns!
[01:58:52.338 --> 01:58:53.680]  They like Jesus!
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.221]  No, no, no!
[01:58:55.221 --> 01:58:58.423]  You get drag queen story time!
[01:58:58.423 --> 01:59:01.506]  You get smuggled and kidnapped little kids!
[01:59:01.506 --> 01:59:02.867]  You get devalued currency!
[01:59:02.867 --> 01:59:04.508]  You get world government!
[01:59:04.508 --> 01:59:07.030]  You get fentanyl shipped in!
[01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:08.191]  You don't get that!
[01:59:08.191 --> 01:59:10.132]  No, no, no!
[01:59:10.132 --> 01:59:13.055]  We're the liberal masters!
[01:59:13.055 --> 01:59:16.117]  Alright, Charles, finish up your point about January 6th and where this is going.
[01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:28.572]  The vast majority of the people that went in on January 6th were some of the best patriots that we have.
[01:59:28.572 --> 01:59:33.715]  You know, they just got duped into going in there and being waved in by FBI and the cops and whatnot.
[01:59:33.715 --> 01:59:39.659]  Most of them walked through the velvet ropes, did nothing wrong, caused no violence.
[01:59:39.659 --> 01:59:46.744]  And, you know, these are incredible patriots, and I want to see something else done to try to get them out.
[01:59:46.744 --> 01:59:47.224]  I agree.
[01:59:47.224 --> 01:59:48.645]  I'd like to see George Soros
[01:59:50.194 --> 01:59:54.438]  And I'd like to see Bill Gates and all them in solitary confinement.
[01:59:54.438 --> 01:59:57.860]  I mean, they deserve it.
[01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:58.461]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:58.461 --> 01:59:58.681]  Yeah.
[01:59:58.681 --> 02:00:02.444]  Just just for starters, you know, so we can get them tried and convicted.
[02:00:02.444 --> 02:00:06.127]  And I have a few thoughts of what, you know, the penalty would be.
[02:00:06.127 --> 02:00:14.114]  But yeah, they're the ones who truly behind should be behind bars right now, not the not the patriots.
[02:00:14.114 --> 02:00:17.897]  What do you think about having a rally
[02:00:19.096 --> 02:00:28.819]  You know, like we did with the Stop the Steals, but just having a very peaceful, peaceful rally, talking about due process, getting many, many thousands of patriots there.
[02:00:29.677 --> 02:00:32.498]  And saying we're not going to take this anymore.
[02:00:32.498 --> 02:00:33.998]  We want them to have due process.
[02:00:33.998 --> 02:00:36.639]  I think President Trump should have another rally in D.C.
[02:00:36.639 --> 02:00:40.840]  and make it all about how we're not going to be provocateured, we're not going to be violent, and we're against antifa.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:42.981]  I think we should have a peaceful rally in D.C.
[02:00:42.981 --> 02:00:44.041]  for those that are held captive.
[02:00:44.041 --> 02:00:44.301]  I agree.
[02:00:44.301 --> 02:00:51.603]  Instead of running from September, instead of running from January 6th, we need to run towards it and expose the globalist role.
[02:00:54.651 --> 02:01:03.654]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.
[02:01:03.654 --> 02:01:07.716]  BioTrue Selenium is the highest quality selenium from the mustard seed.
[02:01:07.716 --> 02:01:10.897]  It is essential for all cellular activity in the body.
[02:01:10.897 --> 02:01:12.978]  It's critical and it funds the info war.
[02:01:12.978 --> 02:01:14.038]  It's back in stock.
[02:01:14.038 --> 02:01:15.698]  Then we have Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:01:15.698 --> 02:01:17.179]  Highest grade of krill oil.
[02:01:17.179 --> 02:01:21.861]  All the things it does for your brain, your cardiovascular system, your memory, your sleep, everything.
[02:01:21.861 --> 02:01:22.601]  It's back in stock.
[02:01:23.301 --> 02:01:26.502]  And by the way, all these are discounted 40 to 50% off.
[02:01:26.502 --> 02:01:29.343]  But then, one more other great item is now back in stock.
[02:01:29.343 --> 02:01:33.464]  We got a good shipment of it in, so I want to offer it the lowest price ever, so you experience the benefits.
[02:01:33.464 --> 02:01:39.486]  And that is Survival Shield X3 Triionine, 60% off, with free shipping, double Patreon points.
[02:01:39.486 --> 02:01:42.047]  The other products are 50% off and 40% off.
[02:01:42.047 --> 02:01:44.107]  Check them out today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:01:44.107 --> 02:01:46.008]  The trifecta of InfoWars products.
[02:01:46.008 --> 02:01:46.808]  Bio-Truth Selenium,
[02:01:47.528 --> 02:01:54.015]  X3 and Ultimate Krill Oil back in stock at InfoWareStore.com and you can't lose because you also fund the InfoWare.
[02:02:12.461 --> 02:02:19.726]  We got some really big guests tomorrow in the special Saturday transmission I'm going to take today and tomorrow with like five, six guests.
[02:02:19.726 --> 02:02:21.667]  It's going to air commercial-free.
[02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:25.409]  There'll be a few breaks, but we're not going to run the regular commercial ads.
[02:02:25.409 --> 02:02:28.811]  I think we had like a three-hour show last weekend, and like five minutes was ads.
[02:02:28.811 --> 02:02:37.677]  The point is, it's going to be a very powerful transmission this Saturday, 2 p.m.
[02:02:37.677 --> 02:02:39.258]  Central, 3 p.m.
[02:02:39.258 --> 02:02:39.538]  Eastern.
[02:02:41.038 --> 02:02:42.178]  That you're not going to want to miss.
[02:02:42.178 --> 02:02:55.643]  Now, I was given information that I'm not going to cover until Max Keiser joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:02:55.643 --> 02:03:02.705]  And I want to ask the great intrepid crew, because the book's been out of print forever, but I know there's one around here.
[02:03:02.705 --> 02:03:06.626]  My book, 9-11 Dissent and Tyranny, has this in it.
[02:03:10.512 --> 02:03:14.833]  I'll cover it at the bottom of the hour.
[02:03:14.833 --> 02:03:34.878]  They are now announcing Matrix Pots that people will put their bodies into and the government is talking about it being punishment for you and your family.
[02:03:34.878 --> 02:03:35.898]  If we don't start
[02:03:37.012 --> 02:03:40.635]  Caring about humanity and giving babies value and old people value?
[02:03:40.635 --> 02:03:41.876]  Do you think any of us are safe?
[02:03:41.876 --> 02:03:51.644]  You have to understand, there is a desire by the globalists to basically rip and tear humans apart.
[02:03:51.644 --> 02:03:53.525]  We've got to oppose these psychotics.
[02:03:53.525 --> 02:04:00.110]  They want to rape and attack everything you can imagine.
[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:03.173]  I told you the Pentagon back in the 70s had a plan.
[02:04:03.173 --> 02:04:03.813]  We're already going there.
[02:04:03.813 --> 02:04:05.835]  I'll do it at the bottom of the hour.
[02:04:07.463 --> 02:04:14.027]  Put us in tanks from birth to then feed us a virtual reality, because the argument would be, as well, our brains all that matters.
[02:04:14.027 --> 02:04:16.048]  Who cares if our body isn't real?
[02:04:16.048 --> 02:04:21.311]  So that no violence would ever be allowed, because basically you're born into a video game.
[02:04:21.311 --> 02:04:23.052]  It's total enslavement.
[02:04:23.052 --> 02:04:25.714]  It's prison to the next level.
[02:04:25.714 --> 02:04:33.799]  And so you see the Matrix, 1999, that was all a Pentagon plan.
[02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:35.480]  We can say, well, plans are like
[02:04:36.738 --> 02:04:38.579]  Rear ends, everybody's got one.
[02:04:38.579 --> 02:04:43.062]  Yeah, but this group at DARPA had the plans for the Internet as well, and they got it.
[02:04:43.062 --> 02:04:49.927]  So, it's just total nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, and I mean, it's never going to stop.
[02:04:49.927 --> 02:04:55.891]  They want to artificially cut off everything that's real that works to force us into the new system they're setting up.
[02:04:55.891 --> 02:04:58.553]  I'll talk about it with Max Keiser, bottom of the hour.
[02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:00.574]  Let's go back to your phone calls and move quickly here.
[02:05:02.936 --> 02:05:04.858]  Aaron, thank you for letting us call you back.
[02:05:04.858 --> 02:05:05.898]  You were left on hold yesterday.
[02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:07.279]  We appreciate you.
[02:05:07.279 --> 02:05:08.760]  South Carolina, go ahead.
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.482]  You're on the air.
[02:05:10.482 --> 02:05:11.462]  You're welcome.
[02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:14.224]  I was there with you January 6th.
[02:05:14.224 --> 02:05:16.906]  We exchanged a couple of God bless yous.
[02:05:16.906 --> 02:05:18.107]  I've got a question for you.
[02:05:18.107 --> 02:05:23.691]  I promise I'm going somewhere with the question, and then if you want me to plug, I can do that as well.
[02:05:23.691 --> 02:05:27.594]  My question, Alex, have you seen any of the Chosen shows?
[02:05:27.594 --> 02:05:30.036]  The ones about Jesus that have been coming out recently?
[02:05:31.349 --> 02:05:32.190]  No, I'll be honest.
[02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:34.771]  I mean, I watch very little TV.
[02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:36.372]  Okay, listen.
[02:05:36.372 --> 02:05:43.177]  I would encourage you to watch the last one, five or six, but it's about John the Baptist and Jesus.
[02:05:43.177 --> 02:05:45.578]  They're having this conversation.
[02:05:45.578 --> 02:05:47.840]  John's talking about what he has to do.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.161]  He has to go confront Herod.
[02:05:50.161 --> 02:05:51.662]  He has to.
[02:05:51.662 --> 02:05:56.326]  And while he's doing that, Jesus knows, man, this is the last time I'm going to see my cousin.
[02:05:56.326 --> 02:05:57.907]  He's about to get killed.
[02:05:57.907 --> 02:05:59.888]  So he tells him, John,
[02:06:00.467 --> 02:06:02.108]  I know you're going to do what you're going to do.
[02:06:02.108 --> 02:06:05.909]  Just listen to God as you do it.
[02:06:05.909 --> 02:06:07.710]  I think that's the message for you, man.
[02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:18.434]  Alex, I really believe that you're a prophet to the United States of America, possibly the world, and it's really important that you listen to God.
[02:06:18.434 --> 02:06:19.394]  You do it His way.
[02:06:19.394 --> 02:06:21.235]  The stakes are so high right now.
[02:06:21.235 --> 02:06:21.935]  Well, don't worry.
[02:06:21.935 --> 02:06:22.575]  I am.
[02:06:22.575 --> 02:06:24.416]  My God's telling me to attack.
[02:06:24.416 --> 02:06:26.437]  God's telling me to go full speed.
[02:06:26.437 --> 02:06:27.077]  Okay.
[02:06:27.077 --> 02:06:27.497]  Okay.
[02:06:27.497 --> 02:06:27.918]  That's cool.
[02:06:29.901 --> 02:06:30.942]  I'll stand with you.
[02:06:30.942 --> 02:06:32.183]  I stand with you, brother.
[02:06:32.183 --> 02:06:41.810]  And in fact, another thing I wanted to say, every single person listening right now, every single person, go to the website, go to InfoWars.
[02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:48.696]  If all you can donate is a dollar, just give something today.
[02:06:48.696 --> 02:06:54.220]  Well, that's my only concern is they won't be smart if they, and I'm not comparing myself to John the Baptist, but everything's an archetype of that.
[02:06:55.053 --> 02:07:00.216]  That's why so many patriots, they kill them and their family to blame the person for killing their family.
[02:07:00.216 --> 02:07:03.318]  I would never kill my family, and that's the type of thing they would pull.
[02:07:03.318 --> 02:07:07.641]  So, they're going to want to try to kill me in a discrediting way.
[02:07:08.823 --> 02:07:11.985]  So, that's why, I mean, I'm a pretty straight-laced guy.
[02:07:11.985 --> 02:07:13.866]  There's not really any way to do that.
[02:07:13.866 --> 02:07:15.167]  I'm not speaking that over you.
[02:07:15.167 --> 02:07:16.507]  I don't want that to happen.
[02:07:16.507 --> 02:07:17.548]  No, no, no.
[02:07:17.548 --> 02:07:18.729]  It needs to be said.
[02:07:18.729 --> 02:07:19.849]  Believe me, we're in the season.
[02:07:19.849 --> 02:07:21.090]  Are you kidding?
[02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:22.691]  They want me dead so bad?
[02:07:22.691 --> 02:07:24.171]  We have crippled them.
[02:07:24.171 --> 02:07:28.714]  This broadcast, all you listeners together, they know we are the big enemy.
[02:07:29.372 --> 02:07:31.394]  And we've already inspired so many other people.
[02:07:31.394 --> 02:07:35.358]  Like I told everybody, Joe Rogan's about to get super hardcore six months ago.
[02:07:35.358 --> 02:07:36.619]  People thought I was making it up.
[02:07:36.619 --> 02:07:38.641]  Now Joe's super hardcore.
[02:07:38.641 --> 02:07:42.385]  And I'm not going to name other names, but it's been all of us together that have done this.
[02:07:43.401 --> 02:07:49.424]  And so I've always seen our job as prepping and driving the next big awakening.
[02:07:49.424 --> 02:07:59.589]  And I can now sit back and see our success together, because all of you are just as important as I am, is that we have influenced the entire resistance movement and the main opposition.
[02:07:59.589 --> 02:08:00.629]  So it's a beautiful time.
[02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:01.810]  What else did you want to say, brother?
[02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:06.512]  Hey, everybody listening, get on the phone with your representatives.
[02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:09.033]  Get on there, tell them about the FBI.
[02:08:09.033 --> 02:08:10.294]  They need to be investigated.
[02:08:10.294 --> 02:08:12.095]  So let's put some pressure on these people.
[02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:14.071]  Let's stay at peace, brother.
[02:08:14.071 --> 02:08:16.151]  Listen, I'm with you, man.
[02:08:16.151 --> 02:08:17.492]  I'm glad you're doing what you're doing.
[02:08:17.492 --> 02:08:18.612]  I love you.
[02:08:18.612 --> 02:08:19.453]  I love you, too, brother.
[02:08:19.453 --> 02:08:20.293]  I appreciate you.
[02:08:20.293 --> 02:08:21.874]  No, I mean, I've said that prayer many times.
[02:08:21.874 --> 02:08:23.715]  God, tell me what you want me to do.
[02:08:23.715 --> 02:08:24.595]  God's like my whole life.
[02:08:24.595 --> 02:08:25.215]  You sure you want it?
[02:08:25.215 --> 02:08:26.156]  You sure you want it?
[02:08:26.156 --> 02:08:28.957]  And every step was like more pressure, more pressure, more pressure.
[02:08:28.957 --> 02:08:32.919]  And now it's like I'm not even questioning, but it's like you asked for this.
[02:08:32.919 --> 02:08:33.159]  Now do it.
[02:08:34.059 --> 02:08:35.179]  Do it now!
[02:08:35.179 --> 02:08:44.241]  And I mean, I just want to be the best I can be and be the strongest and really deliver as much truth as I can and attack this thing head on.
[02:08:44.241 --> 02:08:45.361]  It's a real honor.
[02:08:45.361 --> 02:08:47.682]  I'm not looking forward to whatever it is they're going to do to me.
[02:08:47.682 --> 02:08:49.542]  And I just trust in God, that's all that matters.
[02:08:49.542 --> 02:08:51.342]  But all the flesh has to be burned away.
[02:08:51.342 --> 02:08:53.763]  And it will be burned away.
[02:08:53.763 --> 02:08:57.764]  Just every moment of my life, I do not want to be the Attorney General.
[02:08:57.764 --> 02:08:58.964]  I do not want to be the Queen of England.
[02:09:00.330 --> 02:09:07.032]  I do not want to be the globalist, you know, where they're so out of their minds, just toddling around about to be destroyed.
[02:09:07.032 --> 02:09:07.432]  All of it.
[02:09:07.432 --> 02:09:09.172]  I want to be far away from them.
[02:09:09.172 --> 02:09:11.593]  And so I'm right where I want to be.
[02:09:11.593 --> 02:09:11.893]  All right.
[02:09:11.893 --> 02:09:13.793]  Let's go ahead and take more calls.
[02:09:13.793 --> 02:09:14.934]  Who's up next here?
[02:09:14.934 --> 02:09:17.834]  Let's go to Deshaun in California.
[02:09:17.834 --> 02:09:18.795]  Deshaun, thanks for holding.
[02:09:18.795 --> 02:09:20.355]  Welcome.
[02:09:20.355 --> 02:09:21.035]  All right, Alex.
[02:09:21.035 --> 02:09:21.975]  This is what it is.
[02:09:21.975 --> 02:09:23.656]  This is the next big thing they're going to do.
[02:09:23.656 --> 02:09:26.616]  America is so scared right now.
[02:09:26.616 --> 02:09:28.657]  They're going to fake a nuclear attack on us.
[02:09:29.272 --> 02:09:38.619]  And the people gonna just hide in their house again, and then that's when they're gonna bring out their little SS Nazis and come after us.
[02:09:38.619 --> 02:09:39.700]  Is that what your gut's telling you?
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:44.063]  Yeah, because I think space alien attack, nuclear attack, anything goes now.
[02:09:45.046 --> 02:09:51.354]  Yeah because we believe the virus so therefore the whole world kind of scared right now.
[02:09:51.354 --> 02:09:54.397]  You can fake a nuclear war with us and they're going to believe it.
[02:09:54.397 --> 02:09:59.063]  You can blow up a couple of mountains over here and they will swear we was attacked by China.
[02:09:59.063 --> 02:10:01.666]  So they're going to probably use that just to keep us in check.
[02:10:02.146 --> 02:10:03.908]  And they're on lockdown, period.
[02:10:03.908 --> 02:10:11.293]  And then they're going to have it to where you can only come out on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when there might not be an attack, or Wednesday or Friday.
[02:10:11.293 --> 02:10:12.594]  That's what they're going to do to us.
[02:10:12.594 --> 02:10:14.816]  And that's going to push in the Green Agenda.
[02:10:14.816 --> 02:10:16.598]  And we can't use the water.
[02:10:16.598 --> 02:10:18.139]  This is a whole sabotage attack.
[02:10:21.776 --> 02:10:22.416]  I agree with you.
[02:10:22.416 --> 02:10:22.877]  That's the fact.
[02:10:22.877 --> 02:10:24.758]  You're the type of caller I've been looking for.
[02:10:24.758 --> 02:10:27.379]  All the callers are great, but what can they pull?
[02:10:27.379 --> 02:10:33.082]  Yeah, a limited nuclear attack, a cyber lockdown, a fake alien invasion.
[02:10:33.082 --> 02:10:35.203]  I mean, they've all got it all ready.
[02:10:35.203 --> 02:10:37.224]  What else do you think?
[02:10:37.224 --> 02:10:39.385]  Look, there's nothing I want to get at you with this.
[02:10:39.385 --> 02:10:40.426]  Listen.
[02:10:40.426 --> 02:10:42.767]  Blacks is 13% of the population.
[02:10:42.767 --> 02:10:45.688]  There won't be no race riot, okay?
[02:10:45.688 --> 02:10:48.070]  We're just waiting for y'all to rise up.
[02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:48.930]  It's the white man.
[02:10:48.930 --> 02:10:50.551]  You're at war with yourself.
[02:10:51.692 --> 02:10:53.733]  No, brother, I get it.
[02:10:53.733 --> 02:10:59.254]  The globalists want to start a war with the globalists attacking Americans and claim it's black people.
[02:10:59.254 --> 02:11:00.134]  I totally agree with you.
[02:11:00.134 --> 02:11:00.654]  It's not true.
[02:11:00.654 --> 02:11:03.435]  Yeah, but like, but like, no, but y'all have to worry about yourself.
[02:11:03.435 --> 02:11:06.256]  This is falling like, like Europe and like Rome.
[02:11:06.256 --> 02:11:09.336]  Um, you got some evil leaders at the top and they white.
[02:11:09.336 --> 02:11:11.577]  And like I said, they want to kill y'all off too.
[02:11:11.577 --> 02:11:15.178]  So Joe Biden is the bloods and y'all guys are the crypts.
[02:11:15.638 --> 02:11:20.221]  Y'all gonna have to collide with each other, period, to save this republic, man.
[02:11:20.221 --> 02:11:22.602]  And like I said, it ain't about the black and white issue.
[02:11:22.602 --> 02:11:27.025]  We know what's going on, and a lot of blacks is knowing they're waking up to it.
[02:11:27.025 --> 02:11:27.726]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:11:27.726 --> 02:11:31.428]  But it's up to the white men, it's up to y'all to take this country back, man.
[02:11:31.428 --> 02:11:34.710]  Brother, I think it's up to all of us to shine, but I love you, and I appreciate you.
[02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:36.071]  Powerful caller.
[02:11:36.071 --> 02:11:38.552]  Wow, that's why I need to take more calls.
[02:11:38.552 --> 02:11:40.433]  And tomorrow, I'm taking a bunch of calls.
[02:11:40.433 --> 02:11:42.755]  I got five guests set up so far.
[02:11:43.806 --> 02:11:45.868]  Five of them, big guests.
[02:11:45.868 --> 02:11:47.509]  2pm tomorrow, you're gonna hear them.
[02:11:47.509 --> 02:11:49.130]  Wow, I appreciate the crew doing a great job.
[02:11:49.130 --> 02:11:56.396]  Stay with us.
[02:11:56.396 --> 02:11:58.478]  Your voice counts.
[02:11:58.478 --> 02:12:03.542]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:12:03.542 --> 02:12:06.124]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:12:06.124 --> 02:12:06.885]  They know you're angry.
[02:12:07.612 --> 02:12:13.019]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:12:54.341 --> 02:12:58.425]  All the evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[02:12:58.425 --> 02:12:59.926]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[02:12:59.926 --> 02:13:01.228]  I'm trying to stand up and do the right thing.

[02:16:01.602 --> 02:16:03.263]  They're not going to win.
[02:16:03.263 --> 02:16:04.883]  Some of the big articles on InfoWars.com.
[02:16:04.883 --> 02:16:10.886]  Comedian Jimmy Dore still suffering from side effects of two months after Moderna jabs.
[02:16:10.886 --> 02:16:13.067]  Heart problems.
[02:16:13.067 --> 02:16:15.248]  Healthy guy before that.
[02:16:15.248 --> 02:16:16.529]  And can hardly walk up the stairs now.
[02:16:17.699 --> 02:16:21.643]  Holocaust survivor warms, great reset, worse than Hitler's master plan.
[02:16:21.643 --> 02:16:22.483]  This is global.
[02:16:22.483 --> 02:16:25.986]  We've got all that coming up today.
[02:16:25.986 --> 02:16:33.633]  Infowars.com is the main site to spread the light.
[02:16:33.633 --> 02:16:37.416]  Let's go to, who's been home the longest here?
[02:16:37.416 --> 02:16:38.137]  Let me look.
[02:16:38.137 --> 02:16:40.359]  Owlkiller in Virginia.
[02:16:40.359 --> 02:16:42.681]  That's a caller, been calling for 20 years.
[02:16:42.681 --> 02:16:43.662]  Owlkiller, welcome sir.
[02:16:45.058 --> 02:16:48.921]  So Alex, first off, I want to give you some product placement.
[02:16:48.921 --> 02:16:53.184]  Everybody that's looking for a blast from the past, you might want to check out Dr. Jones Naturals.
[02:16:53.184 --> 02:16:54.865]  That's all I'm going to say on that.
[02:16:54.865 --> 02:16:57.708]  Your mouth will thank you for it.
[02:16:57.708 --> 02:17:02.011]  I have a question regarding the Vitamin Mineral Fusion and the new multivitamin you came out.
[02:17:02.011 --> 02:17:03.312]  Which one do you use?
[02:17:03.312 --> 02:17:05.133]  Because I just bought the three-pack.
[02:17:05.133 --> 02:17:08.776]  I want to know which one you think is better in the total before I go to my point.
[02:17:09.591 --> 02:17:10.912]  They're all three different things.
[02:17:10.912 --> 02:17:12.813]  I just went out and said, there's a market for this.
[02:17:12.813 --> 02:17:13.994]  It works good.
[02:17:13.994 --> 02:17:15.195]  And they're all three different things.
[02:17:15.195 --> 02:17:18.257]  If I was going to take one of them, I'd take the multivitamin.
[02:17:18.257 --> 02:17:19.619]  But the vitamin C is incredible.
[02:17:19.619 --> 02:17:21.660]  I get a lot of sun, so I don't need D3.
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:21.740]  Yeah.
[02:17:24.463 --> 02:17:27.224]  Okay, um, two things I wanted to suggest.
[02:17:27.224 --> 02:17:29.245]  An Un-Vaxxed Lives Matters t-shirt.
[02:17:29.245 --> 02:17:31.786]  I've been trying to get a call into you for a month about this.
[02:17:31.786 --> 02:17:32.887]  That will sell.
[02:17:32.887 --> 02:17:36.648]  You could probably make that for three or four years running and that'll be your best-selling shirt.
[02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:37.669]  That's a genius shirt!
[02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:41.070]  We'll put out Un-Vaxxed Lives Matter right now.
[02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:46.733]  Okay, and then I would, I know you were having issues making the Obama Deception 2 because everything was moving so fast.
[02:17:46.733 --> 02:17:51.595]  Think about Obama Deception 2, the Joe-Bama Deception, or just the Joe-Bama Deception.
[02:17:52.808 --> 02:17:55.549]  So I wanted to get to the Great Reset.
[02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:58.531]  So you see now they're talking about it on Fox News.
[02:17:58.531 --> 02:17:59.471]  That's you.
[02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:00.612]  You did that.
[02:18:00.612 --> 02:18:03.233]  Well, let's be clear, that's our audience.
[02:18:03.233 --> 02:18:05.194]  Seriously, it's not me patting you on the head.
[02:18:05.194 --> 02:18:08.696]  If you guys and gals don't spread the word, this is you.
[02:18:08.696 --> 02:18:14.039]  We have an audience to push this out and make people look at it.
[02:18:14.039 --> 02:18:20.382]  And you asked me about 10 years ago what I thought was next, and it was specifically about gun confiscation.
[02:18:20.382 --> 02:18:21.683]  They're not going to take your guns.
[02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:29.632]  People are going to turn them in, because it's going to get so bad, and if you want to eat and you want to drink, you're going to give up... Exactly, it's your social credit score.
[02:18:29.632 --> 02:18:32.053]  You've got to turn the gun in for the money.
[02:18:32.053 --> 02:18:33.913]  So that's where this is going.
[02:18:33.913 --> 02:18:36.794]  That's why Klaus Schwab is so arrogant.
[02:18:36.794 --> 02:18:43.276]  He's up there, basically telling you... Because they've created multi-quadrillions of fake money.
[02:18:43.276 --> 02:18:45.096]  The real assets are a fraction of that.
[02:18:45.096 --> 02:18:46.837]  They can dictate our surrender, they think.
[02:18:47.811 --> 02:18:51.292]  So, we do need a great reset, but we need to reset them.
[02:18:51.292 --> 02:18:54.533]  You cannot compete with... It's a fact.
[02:18:54.533 --> 02:18:59.075]  I heard this... You can't compete with global firms that have given themselves trillions.
[02:18:59.075 --> 02:18:59.755]  Correct.
[02:18:59.755 --> 02:19:06.857]  So, my thing with Trump... Trump, stay off the left-right thing.
[02:19:06.857 --> 02:19:09.058]  If you play the cards right, if you play
[02:19:09.727 --> 02:19:16.592]  That I'm fighting the system that is screwing you every day, and they're coming after me too, everybody is going to join your side.
[02:19:16.592 --> 02:19:20.875]  But you need to point out the Great Reset, you need to point out- I agree, I agree.
[02:19:20.875 --> 02:19:27.059]  If Trump comes out with a Great Reset and announces America's under globalist takeover, it's over, he totally wins.
[02:19:27.059 --> 02:19:30.521]  And that's why they want to get rid of him before he figures it out.
[02:19:30.521 --> 02:19:36.225]  And that's why it's so dangerous that we've got Fox News hosts starting to talk about this, because that's all Trump listens to.
[02:19:38.953 --> 02:19:44.578]  The thing is, is that if he doesn't understand it, people around him do.
[02:19:44.578 --> 02:19:45.739]  General Flynn does.
[02:19:45.739 --> 02:19:47.241]  Roger Stone does.
[02:19:47.241 --> 02:19:48.142]  People around him.
[02:19:48.142 --> 02:19:49.843]  Tucker Carlson does.
[02:19:49.843 --> 02:19:54.327]  So, get them, get yourself to get the points to him.
[02:19:54.327 --> 02:19:58.331]  Well, I can tell you, Tucker gave him all the points and Trump didn't listen.
[02:19:58.331 --> 02:20:00.353]  And that's why Tucker's pissed off at Trump.
[02:20:00.353 --> 02:20:01.054]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:20:01.847 --> 02:20:02.987]  But yeah, no, I hear you.
[02:20:02.987 --> 02:20:03.508]  Absolutely.
[02:20:03.508 --> 02:20:05.088]  And Trump's an incredible asset.
[02:20:05.088 --> 02:20:10.930]  That's why they want him out of the picture, so he doesn't lead a takeover of the Republican Party, which we're one inch away from.
[02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:12.370]  We are so close to victory.
[02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:17.552]  That's why the deep state is so dangerous and is going to launch terror attacks claiming conservatives are white supremacists.
[02:20:17.552 --> 02:20:19.253]  White supremacists, I love everybody.
[02:20:19.253 --> 02:20:20.313]  That is a load of crap.
[02:20:20.313 --> 02:20:21.273]  They are the depopulationists.
[02:20:21.273 --> 02:20:23.194]  I've never met a white supremacist in my life.
[02:20:23.194 --> 02:20:23.634]  Absolutely.
[02:20:23.634 --> 02:20:24.434]  We know that, Al Killer.
[02:20:24.434 --> 02:20:25.295]  Thank you.
[02:20:25.295 --> 02:20:26.475]  But we've got to get back in their face.
[02:20:27.688 --> 02:20:29.769]  They've got to get back in their face with this.
[02:20:29.769 --> 02:20:36.834]  And it's not the black people doing it, it's the white liberal academics that want to rule the world that are using this for control.
[02:20:36.834 --> 02:20:41.998]  All right, Kevin in New York, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:20:41.998 --> 02:20:43.259]  Hey Alex, how we doing?
[02:20:43.259 --> 02:20:44.700]  Good, bro.
[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:45.240]  Good, good.
[02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:51.825]  So I have kind of an idea that preemptively hear your audience, hear the world,
[02:20:52.526 --> 02:21:03.436]  For what's about to strike this country, because we need to really sit down and take a look back, back to 9-11, we can go back to 1967, the USS Liberty.
[02:21:03.436 --> 02:21:16.269]  There's going to be something big coming, and I mean, it's not going to be a mass shooting, because they really need to demonize the white Christian, not even white, just the Christian ethos, the people who have a heritage in this country.
[02:21:16.269 --> 02:21:17.690]  That's the class they need to go after.
[02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:27.163]  And the majority of those people are white, but there's a lot of other ethnicities that follow this Americana ethos, this Christian ethos.
[02:21:27.163 --> 02:21:32.105]  In order to do that, and to strike at the heart of that, they need a big event.
[02:21:32.105 --> 02:21:34.166]  Something on the scale of 9-11.
[02:21:34.166 --> 02:21:40.308]  Yes, so is it a giant cyber attack, a new war, a new virus, a race war?
[02:21:40.308 --> 02:21:44.490]  Well, to trigger any of that, I think it's going to be an attack on
[02:21:45.031 --> 02:21:47.513]  Some federal building, either in D.C.
[02:21:47.513 --> 02:21:48.894]  or in some capital.
[02:21:48.894 --> 02:21:52.857]  That's why I would tell people, stay away from those places in the next coming years.
[02:21:52.857 --> 02:22:06.248]  But I think what your show needs to do, and you need to do cross-collaboration with a lot of third parties that have studied 9-11, studied USS Liberty, studied these, it's a big attack, and have like a big forum.
[02:22:06.248 --> 02:22:07.108]  I mean... I agree.
[02:22:07.108 --> 02:22:11.652]  I said three weeks ago with Nick Fuentes and others, we need a forum.
[02:22:12.638 --> 02:22:15.959]  On January 6th, and now you see that public forum happening.
[02:22:15.959 --> 02:22:21.300]  We need to have a giant debate about what's their next false flag, because we can always study the last event, the last war.
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.640]  They're going to play that card.
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:25.041]  That's their card.
[02:22:25.041 --> 02:22:25.601]  Right.
[02:22:25.601 --> 02:22:37.844]  Yeah, I think I think if you really dig into 9-11 and show sort of the methods that they use and stuff and that you can really bring up the 9-11 Truth or Movement again, get that going, because that really is the Achilles heel.
[02:22:37.844 --> 02:22:40.665]  I think the more Americans that are awake to the truth of 9-11,
[02:22:41.813 --> 02:22:51.299]  Uh, the more we're going to win to our side, people are going to begin to understand how these people work and the cards that they play, because it's the same formula they use over and over again.
[02:22:51.299 --> 02:22:55.221]  And I think that's what frustrates me is it's so damn formulaic that people go, why is it formulaic?
[02:22:55.221 --> 02:22:57.022]  Because it works.
[02:22:57.022 --> 02:22:57.863]  Right.
[02:22:57.863 --> 02:23:00.864]  Because human psychology and human nature is never changed.
[02:23:00.864 --> 02:23:03.666]  It's the same throughout millennia.
[02:23:03.666 --> 02:23:08.569]  And I know you, I know you, uh, you don't hit this too much, but I wish you would talk more about
[02:23:09.062 --> 02:23:14.725]  The history of the Bolshevik era, the USSR takeover with the Leninists, Stalinists.
[02:23:14.725 --> 02:23:28.732]  I know you're talking about the Maoist revolution, but really, the formula... Well, sir, I mean, this is all the same play that was done to Russia and then magnified by China, because the globalists lost control of Russia, and now China's their big baby.
[02:23:28.732 --> 02:23:29.192]  But I hear you.
[02:23:29.192 --> 02:23:36.175]  It's the exact same playbook, and it is very cold-blooded folks that think it's their right to rule over us, and we've just got to say no to it.
[02:23:36.175 --> 02:23:36.756]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:38.689 --> 02:23:39.889]  I know we got loaded phones.
[02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:41.550]  We got Max Keiser coming up.
[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:43.090]  Then I'm going to jam those calls in.
[02:23:43.090 --> 02:23:46.051]  And then, we've got a special guest host coming up.
[02:23:46.051 --> 02:23:46.551]  Stay with us.

[02:24:03.254 --> 02:24:05.855]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:24:05.855 --> 02:24:06.615]  They know you're angry.
[02:24:07.336 --> 02:24:12.743]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[02:24:55.391 --> 02:25:03.585]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:25:04.873 --> 02:25:09.614]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:25:09.614 --> 02:25:11.955]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:25:11.955 --> 02:25:20.798]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:25:20.798 --> 02:25:31.961]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:25:31.961 --> 02:25:32.181]  Yes.
[02:25:32.641 --> 02:25:37.563]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:25:37.563 --> 02:25:44.346]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:25:44.346 --> 02:25:45.507]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:25:45.507 --> 02:25:47.388]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:25:47.388 --> 02:25:50.189]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:25:50.189 --> 02:25:53.371]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:25:54.711 --> 02:26:01.433]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[02:26:01.433 --> 02:26:04.995]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[02:26:04.995 --> 02:26:07.436]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[02:26:07.436 --> 02:26:09.536]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[02:26:09.536 --> 02:26:12.217]  It's well known for the things it does for our body.
[02:26:12.217 --> 02:26:13.978]  It makes our lives so much better.
[02:26:14.578 --> 02:26:18.541]  But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[02:26:18.541 --> 02:26:20.723]  And we've got both at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:26:20.723 --> 02:26:27.128]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock.
[02:26:27.128 --> 02:26:28.830]  Well, it's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:37.957]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:26:38.317 --> 02:26:40.540]  With free shipping and double pay for your points.
[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:43.845]  Because I want those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it.
[02:26:43.845 --> 02:26:47.189]  And I want new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us.
[02:26:47.189 --> 02:26:51.495]  And then try regular crenel oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[02:26:51.495 --> 02:26:54.118]  This is the highest grade, back in stock, at HomeWearStore.com.
[02:26:55.969 --> 02:26:59.611]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:26:59.611 --> 02:27:02.252]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[02:27:02.252 --> 02:27:13.196]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[02:27:13.196 --> 02:27:17.437]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[02:27:17.437 --> 02:27:22.539]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[02:27:22.539 --> 02:27:24.260]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:29.862]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[02:27:29.862 --> 02:27:31.443]  It's essential in the body.
[02:27:31.443 --> 02:27:35.245]  But we have our amazing Tri-Iodine, a big shipment came in.
[02:27:35.245 --> 02:27:38.607]  We're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[02:27:38.607 --> 02:27:44.249]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[02:27:44.249 --> 02:27:50.352]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[02:27:50.672 --> 02:27:51.953]  You and your family will love it.
[02:27:51.953 --> 02:27:52.994]  It's incredible for your body.
[02:27:52.994 --> 02:27:56.957]  Get it at InfoWareStore.com today.
[02:27:56.957 --> 02:27:59.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:28:36.586 --> 02:28:50.609]  In my film, published in 2002, The Road to Tyranny, and then in my book, 9-11 Dissent and the Tyranny, I point directly at a Pentagon plan from 1977
[02:28:52.842 --> 02:29:13.546]  Declassified in 2000, but then reclassified later, to have humans born to artificial wombs and put in tanks, so there'd be no more crime, and from birth we'd be in an artificial reality with wires plugged to our brains, and then the ruling class could make sure we had true peace.
[02:29:13.546 --> 02:29:17.327]  You know, that guy turned into the film The Matrix.
[02:29:17.327 --> 02:29:18.327]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:28.604]  This startup harvests body heat to mine cryptocurrencies, the new stack.
[02:29:28.604 --> 02:29:39.930]  And they go on to say their recent speculative craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led to a growing number of people jumping on the viral bandwagon to mine and decentralize peer-to-peer digital currency.
[02:29:39.930 --> 02:29:44.092]  Well, it sounds like something empirical or intangible.
[02:29:44.815 --> 02:29:48.777]  The process of mining bitcoins has serious real-world impacts.
[02:29:48.777 --> 02:29:59.102]  And it goes in to say, the startup group wants you to lay in a bed that then takes your energy and your heat and then transfers it into bitcoin.
[02:29:59.102 --> 02:30:06.246]  But the point is, that's the whole matrix plan from the beginning.
[02:30:06.246 --> 02:30:09.888]  And so now, bitcoin is definitely revolutionizing a lot of things.
[02:30:09.888 --> 02:30:11.569]  The globalists don't like it on some fronts.
[02:30:13.382 --> 02:30:18.005]  But you can also look at that matrix level thing and just say, this is where the future is going.
[02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:22.187]  I wanted to bring that up first because Max Keiser had the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[02:30:22.187 --> 02:30:23.648]  He predicted something like Bitcoin.
[02:30:23.648 --> 02:30:26.630]  He was an early adopter of it more than 10 years ago.
[02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:29.291]  He's been proving it right about to a great extent.
[02:30:29.291 --> 02:30:32.974]  Now he's talking about Latin American countries mining it with volcanic energy.
[02:30:32.974 --> 02:30:35.095]  I mean, this is cutting edge stuff.
[02:30:35.095 --> 02:30:41.859]  But he also coined the term the casino, gulag, and really talked about how we'll turn the human into the commodity.
[02:30:42.749 --> 02:30:43.570]  And here we are.
[02:30:43.570 --> 02:30:45.391]  So that's just an interesting little angle.
[02:30:45.391 --> 02:30:47.632]  I know you also have your big tour coming up.
[02:30:47.632 --> 02:30:48.532]  We can't say on air.
[02:30:48.532 --> 02:30:52.115]  It's run over 200 radio stations, but it's the F Elon tour.
[02:30:52.115 --> 02:30:55.857]  I guess folks are mad at Elon Musk trying to take control of Bitcoin.
[02:30:55.857 --> 02:30:58.998]  And so we'll also talk about that here with Max Keiser today.
[02:30:58.998 --> 02:31:01.400]  Max, good to have you with us.
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:04.161]  Hey, Alex, great to be back with you.
[02:31:04.161 --> 02:31:06.263]  Yeah, the Bitcoin phenomenon is
[02:31:07.446 --> 02:31:08.767]  Becoming global.
[02:31:08.767 --> 02:31:11.328]  And so now all the narratives are coming out.
[02:31:11.328 --> 02:31:15.290]  It's a big threat to central banks, the IMF, the World Bank, regular banks.
[02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:17.751]  So you're going to hear a lot of different narratives.
[02:31:17.751 --> 02:31:26.355]  That particular one about hooking up to some kind of human enabled Bitcoin mining machine, etc.
[02:31:26.355 --> 02:31:28.636]  That's a narrative and it's an interesting narrative.
[02:31:28.636 --> 02:31:32.999]  I think more importantly, what we're seeing in El Salvador right now is
[02:31:34.824 --> 02:31:39.310]  Something that takes precedent when you're talking about Bitcoin and what's happening around the world.
[02:31:39.310 --> 02:31:51.026]  So here's a country that was being subjected to IMF kind of predatory lending and had a really tough time establishing their own sovereignty outside of the IMF.
[02:31:51.406 --> 02:31:55.208]  And what they said was, you know what, we're just going to step completely out of the U.S.
[02:31:55.208 --> 02:31:56.128]  dollar matrix.
[02:31:56.128 --> 02:32:00.329]  And that's where the matrix really resonates, is the U.S.
[02:32:00.329 --> 02:32:01.810]  dollar global matrix.
[02:32:01.810 --> 02:32:06.392]  They said, we're going to make Bitcoin the legal tender here in El Salvador.
[02:32:06.392 --> 02:32:10.513]  And already they're just enjoying tremendous benefits from it.
[02:32:10.513 --> 02:32:14.575]  Both the World Bank and the IMF have both said, hey, you know, you're not allowed to do that.
[02:32:14.575 --> 02:32:20.457]  As a matter of fact, the World Bank, which in their charter with El Salvador, said that there's nothing against
[02:32:20.817 --> 02:32:21.337]  We're good to go.
[02:32:48.636 --> 02:32:52.019]  Showing that inflation is much worse than the Federal Reserve had previously said.
[02:32:52.019 --> 02:32:55.521]  Now the Federal Reserve is having to admit it's going to get really bad.
[02:32:55.521 --> 02:32:58.503]  Claiming maybe interest rates increases are coming.
[02:32:58.503 --> 02:32:59.664]  What's the latest on inflation?
[02:33:01.528 --> 02:33:02.229]  Right.
[02:33:02.229 --> 02:33:09.154]  As we've been saying, that all the money printing is inevitably going to lead to real inflation.
[02:33:09.154 --> 02:33:14.238]  And the reason it's been masked for so many years is because labor has been outsourced to China.
[02:33:14.238 --> 02:33:21.203]  And so you don't really see inflation as such hitting in the supermarket or at the petrol station.
[02:33:21.203 --> 02:33:24.586]  But now that you've got wage parity between China and the U.S.,
[02:33:25.226 --> 02:33:29.407]  The actual inflation numbers are starting to be ratcheted up.
[02:33:29.407 --> 02:33:36.430]  So even the Federal Reserve Bank is saying, well, we're actually 3, 3.5%, which is well above the 2% we were talking about.
[02:33:36.430 --> 02:33:43.352]  The fact is, if you use to calculate inflation the way you should use it, which includes things like housing, health care,
[02:33:44.012 --> 02:33:45.393]  Education and things like that.
[02:33:45.393 --> 02:33:47.895]  The actual inflation rate in America right now is about 12%.
[02:33:47.895 --> 02:33:55.840]  That last time we had inflation this high, Paul Volcker, who was the Central Bank Fed Chairman at that time, raised rates all the way up to 20%.
[02:33:57.125 --> 02:34:01.227]  But the central bank now is saying, oh, no, no, no, we can't raise rates.
[02:34:01.227 --> 02:34:02.207]  They just had a meeting.
[02:34:02.207 --> 02:34:03.968]  They did not raise rates.
[02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:08.529]  And they're saying that the inflation is transitory and it's not a problem.
[02:34:08.529 --> 02:34:21.734]  The reason they say that is because they're in the pocket of Wall Street and Wall Street wants cheap rates to do their mergers and acquisitions and their other corporate activities at the cheapest possible price, which means the cheapest possible interest rates possible.
[02:34:22.114 --> 02:34:27.658]  So the Fed is working at completely odds with the interest of the average American.
[02:34:27.658 --> 02:34:40.769]  The average American... But isn't that because, as you just said, it's the most predatory Federal Reserve in its hundred plus years ever, where this is totally against the average person, totally against the working class, completely against the middle class.
[02:34:40.769 --> 02:34:46.133]  All this free money to mega banks to then buy up every major supplement company we've used.
[02:34:46.513 --> 02:34:47.454]  We're good to go.
[02:35:03.826 --> 02:35:05.186]  That's exactly correct.
[02:35:05.186 --> 02:35:12.248]  The fact that your companies, your vendors, the people you do business with, they're all being bought up by private equity and other groups is a great example.
[02:35:12.248 --> 02:35:14.589]  They are able to borrow money for zero.
[02:35:14.589 --> 02:35:19.030]  And they can buy up income-producing assets and that money goes directly to the bottom line.
[02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:20.250]  It didn't cost them anything.
[02:35:20.250 --> 02:35:24.491]  For you and I, we're living, or a lot of people in America, they're living on credit cards and other debts.
[02:35:24.491 --> 02:35:26.091]  They're paying 17, 18 percent.
[02:35:26.091 --> 02:35:29.052]  Or they go to a payday lender and they pay 2,000 percent annual rates of
[02:35:29.452 --> 02:35:29.753]  Thank you.
[02:35:45.090 --> 02:35:59.057]  The very same mega fat cats of the big tech companies owning slave camps in China, they then fund Black Lives Matter and make it all about a fight between left and right or black and white, while they're involved in the greatest criminal transfer of wealth the world's ever seen.
[02:35:59.057 --> 02:36:00.618]  It's a perfect smoke screen!
[02:36:00.618 --> 02:36:02.038]  I mean, actually, bravo to them!
[02:36:02.038 --> 02:36:04.079]  They really are screwing people over.
[02:36:04.079 --> 02:36:06.381]  How do we counter them?
[02:36:06.381 --> 02:36:10.883]  Well, what you're describing there is, we saw this in China during the Cultural Revolution under Mao.
[02:36:11.886 --> 02:36:12.146]  Right?
[02:36:12.146 --> 02:36:22.050]  So they want to make everybody wear little green jackets and carry a little book from the Federal Reserve Bank talking about how great the interest rate policy is.
[02:36:22.050 --> 02:36:24.411]  So it's a cultural revolution of America.
[02:36:24.411 --> 02:36:29.773]  This is what happens when you let the left take control and you destroy the free market.
[02:36:29.773 --> 02:36:31.113]  And that's what that's all about.
[02:36:31.113 --> 02:36:32.414]  That's what's happening right now.
[02:36:32.414 --> 02:36:37.856]  So I don't think there's anything good going to come out of it by kowtowing to the monarchy.
[02:36:38.456 --> 02:36:40.798]  And then they're going to blame the free market, which this isn't.
[02:36:40.798 --> 02:36:42.640]  This is a crony capitalist market.
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:51.388]  And then the very group that steals the world through this fraud is going to use that as the pretext to then set up their true economic dictatorship.
[02:36:51.388 --> 02:36:53.610]  They already have an economic dictatorship.
[02:36:53.610 --> 02:36:55.031]  This is just the icing on the cake.
[02:36:56.177 --> 02:37:01.180]  Again, just to return to Bitcoin, I mean, Bitcoin is the escape hatch, as Christine Lagarde called it.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:05.682]  It's the only way out of this, and countries like El Salvador are proving that.
[02:37:05.682 --> 02:37:09.164]  But we are already in the monetary dictatorship.
[02:37:09.164 --> 02:37:12.246]  We already suffer financial terrorism and arsonists.
[02:37:12.246 --> 02:37:19.409]  That's why so many people in America are suffering, is because they are being victimized by financial arsonists.
[02:37:19.409 --> 02:37:20.910]  Wait, the megabanks aren't the problem?
[02:37:20.910 --> 02:37:22.571]  I thought white supremacists were the problem?
[02:37:24.286 --> 02:37:39.819]  No, that's a narrative that's put out there to try to eliminate this whole vestige of a free market capitalist society where it's a meritocracy, where there's initiative, and there's entrepreneurialism.
[02:37:39.819 --> 02:37:41.580]  That's got to be gotten rid of.
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:51.689]  Instead, there's a Federal Reserve Bank that issues free money, and the fact that prices are skyrocketing and your quality of life is crashing, you should be feeling good about that.
[02:37:53.510 --> 02:38:05.555]  In the last 16 months, InfoWars researchers have been hard at work developing the ultimate, high-quality, affordable systems to boost your body's natural defenses and make you have an overall healthier, happier life.

[02:39:56.241 --> 02:39:57.001]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:39:57.001 --> 02:39:57.761]  Trying to move quicker.
[02:39:57.761 --> 02:39:58.561]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:58.561 --> 02:39:59.021]  Welcome.
[02:39:59.021 --> 02:40:04.163]  Would like to say, first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity.
[02:40:04.163 --> 02:40:07.544]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year, okay?
[02:40:07.544 --> 02:40:14.006]  I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[02:40:14.006 --> 02:40:15.666]  Living Defense saved my life.
[02:40:15.666 --> 02:40:19.828]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[02:40:19.828 --> 02:40:21.268]  Living Defense brought me back.
[02:40:21.548 --> 02:40:27.069]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[02:40:27.069 --> 02:40:29.490]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:38.772]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[02:40:38.772 --> 02:40:44.193]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[02:40:44.193 --> 02:40:45.733]  That's right where we're at brother.
[02:40:45.953 --> 02:40:55.155]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say, and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[02:40:55.155 --> 02:41:03.677]  Scientists agree magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[02:41:03.677 --> 02:41:07.238]  Magnesium is required for your body to do the following.
[02:41:07.238 --> 02:41:09.459]  Helps convert food into energy.
[02:41:10.114 --> 02:41:12.617]  Helps with muscle contraction function.
[02:41:12.617 --> 02:41:14.599]  Helps regulate the nervous system.
[02:41:14.599 --> 02:41:18.523]  Helps with protein building in the muscles and so much more.
[02:41:18.523 --> 02:41:24.329]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized fizzy magnesium.
[02:41:24.329 --> 02:41:25.070]  It tastes great.
[02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:26.791]  I take it in the morning.
[02:41:26.791 --> 02:41:28.231]  I take it in the evening.
[02:41:28.231 --> 02:41:33.294]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[02:41:33.294 --> 02:41:36.336]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[02:41:36.336 --> 02:41:40.138]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[02:41:40.138 --> 02:41:44.160]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:48.662]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the InfoWar, which is a true 360 win.
[02:41:48.662 --> 02:41:53.084]  Now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com for only $19.95.
[02:41:58.021 --> 02:42:12.126]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:12.126 --> 02:42:13.806]  We are on the march.
[02:42:13.806 --> 02:42:20.228]  The empire is on the run.
[02:42:20.228 --> 02:42:21.949]  But now the empire has struck back.
[02:42:21.949 --> 02:42:23.930]  Final segment with Max Keiser.
[02:42:23.930 --> 02:42:25.170]  We might go five minutes next hour.
[02:42:25.822 --> 02:42:29.263]  But then we have Stu Peters taking over, then the War Room Open Show at 3 p.m.
[02:42:29.263 --> 02:42:29.923]  Central today.
[02:42:29.923 --> 02:42:31.843]  Your word of mouth is victory.
[02:42:31.843 --> 02:42:35.804]  It is key to the whole fight, so thank you for spreading the word about our live feeds, our articles and our videos.
[02:42:35.804 --> 02:42:39.324]  Everybody's blown away by the amount of traffic to Bandai Video.
[02:42:39.324 --> 02:42:47.026]  That's you just sharing those videos on your email list, your text message, you name it, and buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:42:47.026 --> 02:42:51.387]  Now, real quick, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:42:51.387 --> 02:42:53.167]  InfoWarsTore.com is one of the biggest
[02:42:54.102 --> 02:43:04.671]  Distributors in the world of satellite phones, you get a free $600 plus phone when you sign up for a year for your monthly minutes that are $99.95.
[02:43:04.671 --> 02:43:11.877]  But all calls to you are free from sat phones, landlines, cell phones, you name it, and it doesn't track you.
[02:43:11.877 --> 02:43:14.380]  This is the system you want.
[02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:15.380]  It's amazing.
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:19.164]  You also get antennas so it works in your car, in your house, but it works anywhere outside.
[02:43:19.164 --> 02:43:20.585]  You can see the sky day or night.
[02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:23.622]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:43:23.622 --> 02:43:24.923]  Infowarsphone.com.
[02:43:24.923 --> 02:43:27.425]  With all the things going on, you need this.
[02:43:27.425 --> 02:43:29.607]  And I wouldn't just have it as an emergency backup.
[02:43:29.607 --> 02:43:30.468]  I'd start using it.
[02:43:30.468 --> 02:43:31.509]  I've started using them.
[02:43:31.509 --> 02:43:36.393]  It just lets you think about how much your regular cell phone's being tracked.
[02:43:36.393 --> 02:43:37.394]  941-955-1020.
[02:43:37.394 --> 02:43:38.555]  941-955-1020.
[02:43:38.555 --> 02:43:41.778]  Ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:43:41.778 --> 02:43:44.621]  That's Infowarsphone.com.
[02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:47.664]  And it's our sponsors that make it all possible.
[02:43:48.263 --> 02:43:57.708]  Now, you're not really a sponsor, Max Kaiser, but we love you, and you come on, you do a lot of stuff, and I've wanted you to be in studio, but I guess over there on the East Coast, you refused to come out of there.
[02:43:57.708 --> 02:44:03.512]  But you are on the march, though you're a big global globetrotter, but you haven't been doing that much lately.
[02:44:03.512 --> 02:44:14.038]  You're coming to Austin, I'm told, to kick something off with your significant other, Stacey, in Texas very soon, and it's not very friendly towards Elon Musk.
[02:44:14.038 --> 02:44:14.598]  Tell us about it.
[02:44:15.974 --> 02:44:16.314]  Right.
[02:44:16.314 --> 02:44:20.797]  So we're having a big party at Spider House in Austin, Texas.
[02:44:20.797 --> 02:44:22.938]  And it's really a Bitcoin party.
[02:44:22.938 --> 02:44:30.842]  And we're kicking around Elon Musk and Mark Cuban and a lot of people who say stupid things about Bitcoin and a lot of fun.
[02:44:30.842 --> 02:44:32.583]  We're going to have a great barbecue there.
[02:44:32.583 --> 02:44:35.924]  I'd like to give two tickets away right now to your listeners.
[02:44:35.924 --> 02:44:39.346]  You can arrange that on your end and figure out who those two listeners are going to be.
[02:44:39.346 --> 02:44:40.847]  But I'm putting two tickets.
[02:44:40.847 --> 02:44:43.068]  They're going for 150 bucks a ticket right now.
[02:44:43.068 --> 02:44:44.789]  You can still have a few tickets left.
[02:44:45.685 --> 02:44:48.579]  If you go to Eventbrite and search this...
[02:44:49.409 --> 02:44:55.610]  Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, or Max Keiser, or go to my Twitter handle at Max Keiser, you'll find links.
[02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:59.891]  And we've got a few tickets left, and we're going to have a couple hundred, 250 people there.
[02:44:59.891 --> 02:45:02.531]  Bitcoin Magazine's coming on as a media sponsor.
[02:45:02.531 --> 02:45:04.912]  They're going to be live streaming the event.
[02:45:04.912 --> 02:45:10.773]  And it's kind of like a... I've got to tell you, it's great you want to give tickets away, but it's almost sold out.
[02:45:10.773 --> 02:45:12.513]  You could have 5,000 people at this event.
[02:45:12.513 --> 02:45:14.773]  I mean, you were just at one in Miami that was totally jam-packed.
[02:45:14.773 --> 02:45:17.834]  So your problem is you need to do more events, Max.
[02:45:19.389 --> 02:45:20.529]  Well, we're going to go on tour.
[02:45:20.529 --> 02:45:23.210]  So the idea here is to make it a little intimate.
[02:45:23.210 --> 02:45:26.131]  We're going to have a lot of the Bitcoin legends that live in Austin.
[02:45:26.131 --> 02:45:28.032]  Austin is a Bitcoin hotspot in the world.
[02:45:28.032 --> 02:45:32.953]  We're going to have a lot of those folks in the venue so people can rub elbows.
[02:45:32.953 --> 02:45:34.954]  And it's like the Sundance Film Festival.
[02:45:34.954 --> 02:45:39.235]  If you've ever been there, you know, kind of the major stars are walking around Main Street.
[02:45:39.235 --> 02:45:44.077]  Here we're going to have big, you know, legends in the Austin Bitcoin community are going to be right there.
[02:45:44.077 --> 02:45:46.618]  So people who come, they'll be rubbing elbows with these folks.
[02:45:46.618 --> 02:45:46.938]  Sounds good.
[02:45:47.978 --> 02:45:49.159]  Good success.
[02:45:49.159 --> 02:45:51.721]  People can find the dates on your Twitter.
[02:45:51.721 --> 02:45:55.043]  All right, Max Keiser, what's the date you're coming to Austin again?
[02:45:55.043 --> 02:45:56.724]  The show's on July 8th.
[02:45:56.724 --> 02:45:58.705]  I'll be there two days before, two days after.
[02:45:58.705 --> 02:46:01.567]  If anybody needs me for anything, I'm available.
[02:46:01.567 --> 02:46:01.867]  That's good.
[02:46:01.867 --> 02:46:04.009]  So you're going to be in studio with us?
[02:46:04.009 --> 02:46:06.290]  Yes, I will be in the studio with you.
[02:46:06.290 --> 02:46:09.653]  We have to continue our Nerf Gun War.
[02:46:09.653 --> 02:46:12.875]  I won the first battle, Alex Jones.
[02:46:12.875 --> 02:46:13.615]  I forgot about that.
[02:46:13.615 --> 02:46:16.297]  Pull up Max Keiser, Alex Jones, Nerf Guns.
[02:46:16.297 --> 02:46:17.038]  I think I won.
[02:46:17.722 --> 02:46:19.142]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:46:19.142 --> 02:46:22.043]  Hey, Max, getting serious with the time we have left.
[02:46:22.043 --> 02:46:28.224]  I'm really concerned about the Attorney General, the FBI Director saying the greatest threat is conservatives, people that question elections.
[02:46:28.224 --> 02:46:31.785]  They want to get rid of due process, use the Patriot Act on members of Congress.
[02:46:31.785 --> 02:46:33.045]  I'm sure you've seen these clips.
[02:46:33.045 --> 02:46:37.085]  I mean, this is like an authoritarian nightmare right out of a movie.
[02:46:37.085 --> 02:46:39.126]  The old left would have opposed this.
[02:46:39.126 --> 02:46:43.287]  They are really spoiling to come after people, not just the January 6th folks.
[02:46:43.287 --> 02:46:44.527]  What do you think that's about?
[02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:45.787]  I'm really concerned about a false flag.
[02:46:47.789 --> 02:47:00.040]  Well, yeah, it is kind of a continuation of what we were just saying before the break, that you've got a cadre of money printers that understand that the way to enslave people is to flood them with fiat money.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:02.982]  The way people get unhealthy is they eat fiat food.
[02:47:02.982 --> 02:47:06.385]  And, you know, your show has supplements and you try to fight the fiat food.
[02:47:06.385 --> 02:47:09.188]  The way the economy gets sick is it's flooded with fiat money.
[02:47:09.688 --> 02:47:10.369]  And the U.S.
[02:47:10.369 --> 02:47:13.473]  dollar is losing purchasing power every single day.
[02:47:13.473 --> 02:47:17.378]  And people start blaming themselves, like, why is my money losing purchasing power?
[02:47:17.378 --> 02:47:18.720]  They don't really want to take on board.
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:26.850]  It's because of a concerted effort by their own government to destroy the underlying economy so that they can make a few of their friends absolutely rich.
[02:47:27.490 --> 02:47:31.832]  And the same thing is happening now with a democratically controlled Washington, D.C.
[02:47:31.832 --> 02:47:33.813]  They are in the pocket of Wall Street.
[02:47:33.813 --> 02:47:39.855]  The Clintons and all those folks and, you know, Joe Biden came out of the credit card lobbying industry.
[02:47:39.855 --> 02:47:43.256]  He's been the credit card lobbyist in Washington for decades.
[02:47:43.256 --> 02:47:44.897]  That's their constituency.
[02:47:44.897 --> 02:47:46.057]  That's who they work for.
[02:47:46.057 --> 02:47:52.820]  And they want to continue money printing and putting people into as much debt as they possibly can because you've become a debt slave.
[02:47:53.422 --> 02:47:54.543]  That's their agenda.
[02:47:54.543 --> 02:47:58.605]  And then once you become a debt slave, you're going to be prone to anxiety attacks.
[02:47:58.605 --> 02:48:00.185]  So now you're going to take a lot of pharmaceuticals.
[02:48:00.185 --> 02:48:01.366]  So let me ask you this.
[02:48:01.366 --> 02:48:03.387]  What do you think the time frame is on this?
[02:48:03.387 --> 02:48:05.888]  I mean, this is going to get very destructive worldwide.
[02:48:05.888 --> 02:48:09.090]  What countries do you think have better currencies right now?
[02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:10.010]  I know you're all about Bitcoin.
[02:48:10.010 --> 02:48:10.451]  I get that.
[02:48:10.451 --> 02:48:14.993]  But I'm saying the old dinosaur currencies, which one's going to be the first to bite the dust?
[02:48:17.583 --> 02:48:20.506]  They're all hyperinflating right now.
[02:48:20.506 --> 02:48:21.387]  You know, all the time.
[02:48:21.387 --> 02:48:26.392]  You see in some of these countries, the currency is absolutely collapsing.
[02:48:26.392 --> 02:48:32.598]  Aside from El Salvador, now going on to a Bitcoin standard, we have Paraguay and Guatemala.
[02:48:33.158 --> 02:48:37.543]  Are now making moves to make Bitcoin legal tender in those countries.
[02:48:37.543 --> 02:48:44.170]  What's happening in Latin America, Central America, Alex, is the revolution we've been talking about for 10 years.
[02:48:44.170 --> 02:48:54.641]  And that's the most exciting thing in the world today in terms of pushing back against the globalists, the central bankers, the IMF, the World Bank, Jamie Dimon, and the Wall Street Bank.
[02:48:54.641 --> 02:48:55.562]  It's happening right there.
[02:48:56.585 --> 02:49:16.308]  All credit goes to my friend Jack Mollers, who was there for months, putting in the InStrike system, which gives you instant payments on your phone, and great access to Bitcoin, and it's the trending- Absolutely, but just so you know, I'm no fan of Xi Jinping, obviously, but they even came out last week during G7 and said,
[02:49:17.169 --> 02:49:18.931]  You globalists don't run anything anymore.
[02:49:18.931 --> 02:49:20.012]  We're not cutting carbon.
[02:49:20.012 --> 02:49:22.575]  We're going to have three kids instead of one.
[02:49:22.575 --> 02:49:25.278]  And screw you, you don't run the New World Order anymore.
[02:49:25.278 --> 02:49:26.259]  Nobody does.
[02:49:26.259 --> 02:49:27.680]  They said nobody runs it.
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:31.644]  And there's got to be a moment where everybody realizes the whole Kissinger era is over.
[02:49:31.644 --> 02:49:37.090]  What comes out of that is everybody just stops following what the New World Order says or the FBI pointing a gun at your head.
[02:49:38.490 --> 02:49:46.395]  Right, and not to belabor this point, but the thing about Bitcoin, Alex, is that there is no central authority running the protocol.
[02:49:46.395 --> 02:49:47.615]  It's totally decentralized.
[02:49:47.615 --> 02:49:52.098]  You told us a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, countries will start adopting it and others will.
[02:49:52.098 --> 02:49:54.999]  It'll cause a stampede and the hash wars will start.
[02:49:54.999 --> 02:49:55.840]  I got that.
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:00.903]  I'm asking you about... Okay, so China is a centralized, top-down, authoritarian,
[02:50:01.363 --> 02:50:04.164]  The country that's going to lose against Bitcoin.
[02:50:04.164 --> 02:50:07.785]  It's only a question of time when they give up the ghost and succumb.
[02:50:07.785 --> 02:50:12.307]  But I agree, but in between them, they're telling the globalists, put them in power, you screw off.
[02:50:12.307 --> 02:50:15.228]  So that's going to be a big deal.
[02:50:15.228 --> 02:50:24.532]  There's a lot of belligerence happening between China and everybody else, and especially over Hong Kong and especially over Taiwan.
[02:50:24.532 --> 02:50:30.514]  So it looks like we're on, as many have said, you go from currency war to trade war to a hot war.
[02:50:31.134 --> 02:50:33.597]  And now we're entering that hot war era.
[02:50:33.597 --> 02:50:35.118]  So there is an existential crisis.
[02:50:35.118 --> 02:50:36.840]  We are on the footstep, doorstep.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:37.261]  Exactly.
[02:50:37.261 --> 02:50:42.746]  So why is it the left trying to organize America into a cohesive force if we're about to go into a hot war with China?
[02:50:42.746 --> 02:50:48.392]  Instead, they're still trying to fight the old war to dominate people culturally when that makes China have no respect for us.
[02:50:49.542 --> 02:51:01.506]  Because the information in America, and I don't, you know, people who watch Infowars should understand that the information and news in America is completely dictated to by a corporate agenda.
[02:51:01.506 --> 02:51:05.867]  It has absolutely nothing to do with any underlying facts or truth.
[02:51:05.867 --> 02:51:09.888]  And the corporate agenda is hiding behind black people and poor people while it loots the world.
[02:51:09.888 --> 02:51:12.389]  No, no, the corporate agenda is to send bombs.
[02:51:12.689 --> 02:51:19.660]  Because war is incredibly profitable, and those few that make out with war are loving war.
[02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:26.029]  And it's like you said, suicide bankers, like you new people in the World Trade Center who stayed trading to make extra money until they died.
[02:51:27.668 --> 02:51:28.549]  That's right.
[02:51:28.549 --> 02:51:28.969]  That's right.
[02:51:28.969 --> 02:51:34.234]  They were trading airline option puts all the way until the building around them collapsed.
[02:51:34.234 --> 02:51:37.457]  And that's a suicide banker.
[02:51:37.457 --> 02:51:46.906]  But there's the same mentality of Jamie Dimon today, who is out there doing the same thing, but on a subtler basis with his derivatives and all of his lobbying for rights.
[02:51:46.906 --> 02:51:51.811]  So he'll fund the nuclear missiles that blow the planet up, but when the planet blows up, he'll be the richest man.
[02:51:54.123 --> 02:51:57.746]  It's like a Outer Limits episode, right?
[02:51:57.746 --> 02:52:08.435]  It makes no sense from a humanitarian point of view, but if you're a psychotic, serial terrorist, financial terrorist like Wall Street Banker, in your mind, you know, it makes sense.
[02:52:08.435 --> 02:52:10.437]  But these people are psychotic, Alex.
[02:52:10.437 --> 02:52:11.117]  That's the problem.
[02:52:11.117 --> 02:52:14.400]  They are psychotic and they run big banks.
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:14.680]  All right.
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:17.883]  Five more minutes with Max Geiser and then we've got our guest host taking over.
[02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:20.492]  Two Peters always does an amazing job.
[02:52:20.492 --> 02:52:23.094]  And then the War Room, Owen Troyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:23.094 --> 02:52:28.098]  And I want to thank Lister's for promoting the American Journal with Harrison Smith and the War Room.
[02:52:28.098 --> 02:52:33.603]  They're really exploding now, and that's great, because folks work hard on those shows to bring you heartening information.
[02:52:33.603 --> 02:52:36.806]  So hey, you may already know all this stuff, probably know more than I do, doesn't matter.
[02:52:36.806 --> 02:52:40.849]  Share the articles and videos about the shows, because that's how we move the ball forward.
[02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:41.870]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:52:43.385 --> 02:52:50.363]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[02:52:50.916 --> 02:52:56.459]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[02:52:56.459 --> 02:53:04.304]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[02:53:04.304 --> 02:53:05.785]  Humanity is strong.
[02:53:05.785 --> 02:53:06.746]  We're incredible.
[02:53:06.746 --> 02:53:10.528]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[02:53:10.528 --> 02:53:12.989]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[02:53:12.989 --> 02:53:18.913]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[02:53:19.293 --> 02:53:28.978]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[02:53:28.978 --> 02:53:31.300]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:33.821]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[02:53:33.821 --> 02:53:39.284]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[02:53:39.284 --> 02:53:46.748]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[02:53:46.748 --> 02:53:48.269]  What are champions made of?
[02:53:50.110 --> 02:53:51.246]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:53:57.759 --> 02:53:59.340]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:01.260]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:02.581]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:54:02.581 --> 02:54:03.841]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:54:24.029 --> 02:54:27.470]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:54:27.470 --> 02:54:30.751]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:54:30.751 --> 02:54:31.892]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[02:54:31.892 --> 02:54:33.052]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:33.052 --> 02:54:34.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:58.999 --> 02:55:02.584]  El Salvador.
[02:55:02.584 --> 02:55:03.987]  He's been saying it for years.
[02:55:03.987 --> 02:55:09.855]  As soon as countries start adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, he believes it will cause a chain reaction.
[02:55:09.855 --> 02:55:12.019]  That chain reaction has now begun.
[02:55:12.019 --> 02:55:14.823]  Max Keiser, finish up your point on that, please.
[02:55:16.565 --> 02:55:16.865]  Right.
[02:55:16.865 --> 02:55:20.268]  So we talked about it as hash war.
[02:55:20.268 --> 02:55:23.410]  Basically, countries competing with each other.
[02:55:23.410 --> 02:55:28.633]  And this was the answer to when people would come up and say, hey, what if countries outlaw Bitcoin?
[02:55:28.633 --> 02:55:29.434]  Well, there's two answers.
[02:55:29.434 --> 02:55:34.958]  Number one is it's impossible to outlaw Bitcoin, just like it's impossible to outlaw P2P file sharing.
[02:55:34.958 --> 02:55:38.000]  Just ask Hollywood or the recording industry about that.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.643]  You cannot shut down a file sharing network online.
[02:55:42.643 --> 02:55:43.424]  So it's impossible.
[02:55:44.324 --> 02:55:47.647]  Bitcoin is a P2P, essentially, currency.
[02:55:47.647 --> 02:55:53.833]  The second answer is that the more likely scenario is that countries like, here we have El Salvador, realize, you know what?
[02:55:53.833 --> 02:56:02.420]  We can have a banking system that's outside of the current banking system and outside of any nation state with hard money where purchasing power is going to increase.
[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:03.602]  So we're going to adopt Bitcoin.
[02:56:03.602 --> 02:56:04.622]  We're going to mine Bitcoin.
[02:56:04.622 --> 02:56:07.985]  We're going to use volcano energy, geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin.
[02:56:07.985 --> 02:56:10.468]  Now, Paraguay and Guatemala,
[02:56:11.088 --> 02:56:18.250]  I have weighed in and said we're now introducing legislation to also make Bitcoin legal tender in these countries.
[02:56:18.250 --> 02:56:21.291]  Argentina is talking about this.
[02:56:21.291 --> 02:56:24.833]  I would imagine that we won't be long before we hear about Mexico.
[02:56:24.833 --> 02:56:32.095]  So the entire Latin American, South American part of this hemisphere could be on a Bitcoin standard, which is going to force a chain reaction in Europe.
[02:56:32.635 --> 02:56:35.197]  Asia, all over the world, is going to go to a Bitcoin standard.
[02:56:35.197 --> 02:56:51.847]  This is the death kneel for the IMF, the World Bank, JP Morgan, Wall Street banks, the globalists, the war machine, the haters, the killers, the destroyers, are all going to be wiped out by the love explosion that is Bitcoin.
[02:56:51.847 --> 02:56:53.948]  Now, they've really been trying to push Bitcoin down.
[02:56:53.948 --> 02:56:55.349]  I know you've been mad at Elon Musk.
[02:56:56.190 --> 02:56:58.613]  He seems to be kind of manipulating the market right now.
[02:56:58.613 --> 02:57:00.275]  You guys can put up the last month of Bitcoin.
[02:57:00.275 --> 02:57:01.536]  It went down quite a bit.
[02:57:01.536 --> 02:57:02.377]  Now it's going back up.
[02:57:02.377 --> 02:57:02.858]  What's happening?
[02:57:05.220 --> 02:57:12.964]  Well, it's been in this for 10 years, and we've had 15 pullbacks in those 10 years, and this is an average pullback.
[02:57:12.964 --> 02:57:18.087]  It's about the ninth largest pullback in the last 10 years or so.
[02:57:18.087 --> 02:57:24.730]  What more importantly, the underlying fundamentals in terms of corporations like MicroStrategy is adding billions to their balance sheet.
[02:57:24.730 --> 02:57:26.431]  El Salvador is obviously getting into the game.
[02:57:26.431 --> 02:57:29.212]  Sure, we've got even central banks getting involved, governments getting involved.
[02:57:29.212 --> 02:57:34.015]  Compared to where Bitcoin was even a year ago, this seems like a capitulation, as I've called it, to Bitcoin.
[02:57:35.524 --> 02:57:36.625]  It is.
[02:57:36.625 --> 02:57:39.566]  You know, you get the price of Bitcoin you deserve.
[02:57:39.566 --> 02:57:46.050]  Elon Musk, you know, he has a big voice and he has a lot of money and he's tweeting about Bitcoin.
[02:57:46.050 --> 02:57:47.091]  But I used to do that.
[02:57:47.091 --> 02:57:49.452]  When I tweeted about Bitcoin in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the price would move 50 percent a day.
[02:57:52.934 --> 02:57:58.315]  So he's... Elon Musk is doing a Max Keiser, you know, six, seven years later.
[02:57:58.315 --> 02:58:13.798]  Most everything anyone does in Bitcoin, whether it's the insults that they use to criticize it, or the things they'd like to say that they like about it, if you go back to my shows from eight, nine, ten years ago... But I'm not like Peter Schiff, who I think is a good guy, but he could have done it and missed the boat.
[02:58:13.798 --> 02:58:14.398]  I missed the boat.
[02:58:14.398 --> 02:58:15.939]  I meant I was wrong.
[02:58:15.939 --> 02:58:18.139]  So, I see, I learned from my mistakes.
[02:58:19.653 --> 02:58:34.905]  Well, you know, Peter Schiff has a very hard-ended stance, whereas Spencer Schiff, his son, who's a friend of mine, he is all about Bitcoin, loves Bitcoin, he's been buying Bitcoin, and he'll probably be in the Austin event coming up on July 8th at Spider House in Austin.
[02:58:34.905 --> 02:58:38.727]  Tickets still available, search online, and we're giving two away.
[02:58:38.727 --> 02:58:44.512]  On your show, Alex, I don't know how you're going to do that, but two lucky listeners are going to get tickets to the event, Alex!
[02:58:44.512 --> 02:58:46.353]  Well, looks like two of the crew got a ticket, Jeff.
[02:58:46.713 --> 02:58:51.595]  I don't know how I'm supposed to give, I love my listeners, but how am I supposed to give this ticket away?
[02:58:51.595 --> 02:58:57.338]  I love how you give me the responsibility, how about you just give me that 10,000 Bitcoin?
[02:58:57.338 --> 02:59:03.901]  Tell you what, if you give me 10,000 Bitcoin like you tried, I promise I will distribute 80% of it to the listeners.
[02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:11.773]  But it's in a safe place, Alex, and I don't want to burden you with keeping track of it.
[02:59:11.773 --> 02:59:13.273]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:59:13.273 --> 02:59:15.475]  I apologize for 10 years ago.
[02:59:15.475 --> 02:59:16.755]  Now, I will take 1,000 Bitcoin.
[02:59:19.890 --> 02:59:26.352]  Just consider it as a friendly gesture on my behalf to Custodian and to safeguard those coins, Alex.
[02:59:26.352 --> 02:59:33.053]  And we'll revisit this at a time when I feel that you're really mature enough to handle this type of responsibility.
[02:59:33.053 --> 02:59:38.834]  Because it is a whopping big responsibility of about $350 billion worth of Bitcoin.
[02:59:38.834 --> 02:59:44.836]  Well, if I haven't proven I'm responsible now, I want to fund the operation with a small percentage of it, and I will promote Bitcoin with the rest.
[02:59:44.836 --> 02:59:47.477]  You need to give Bitcoin to me.
[02:59:47.477 --> 02:59:49.217]  Thank you, Max Geiser, for being so generous.
[02:59:50.191 --> 02:59:50.932]  Alright, thank you Max.
[02:59:50.932 --> 02:59:51.313]  Yes, sir.

[03:00:57.248 --> 03:01:01.959]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:01:09.713 --> 03:01:11.674]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:11.674 --> 03:01:12.755]  My name is Stu Peters.
[03:01:12.755 --> 03:01:16.037]  You can find me at StuPeters.TV.
[03:01:16.037 --> 03:01:17.438]  Gone last week.
[03:01:17.438 --> 03:01:18.679]  I was in Texas.
[03:01:18.679 --> 03:01:21.501]  Veterans and Celebrity Softball Classic.
[03:01:22.396 --> 03:01:24.797]  What an incredible time that was.
[03:01:24.797 --> 03:01:27.177]  I did miss being here, though, with you guys.
[03:01:27.177 --> 03:01:28.378]  There's so much to cover.
[03:01:28.378 --> 03:01:30.938]  I'm looking at breaking news right now.
[03:01:30.938 --> 03:01:42.301]  We're trying to get Dr. Gene Ruby on the line to talk about some of this, but there are two companies that are so eerily connected, as we have now discovered that every system
[03:01:43.181 --> 03:01:57.397]  At the disposal of these globalists is being weaponized against you and we're discovering now we're finding out the complexity of the relationships not only between individuals not between you know Fauci and Gates because we had those suspicions.
[03:01:58.275 --> 03:01:59.837]  And we're trying to get it out to the masses right now.
[03:01:59.837 --> 03:02:01.058]  We need your help with all of that.
[03:02:01.058 --> 03:02:11.927]  But also the collusion and concerted efforts from allied countries that we have now been able to clearly identify as adversaries of the United States, attackers of freedom, enemies of liberty, destroyers of justice.
[03:02:11.927 --> 03:02:12.548]  They're murderers.
[03:02:12.548 --> 03:02:13.048]  They're criminals.
[03:02:13.048 --> 03:02:13.729]  They're pedophiles.
[03:02:13.729 --> 03:02:16.271]  They're drug and human trafficking terrorists.
[03:02:16.271 --> 03:02:20.855]  And they're not, you know, living in caves in Afghanistan or beheading people in the desert on YouTube videos.
[03:02:21.508 --> 03:02:24.171]  They're living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[03:02:24.171 --> 03:02:27.055]  They're in the empty city of Washington, D.C.
[03:02:27.055 --> 03:02:27.536]  It's eerie.
[03:02:27.536 --> 03:02:28.757]  It's a ghost town.
[03:02:28.757 --> 03:02:33.924]  But we're getting now, as we start to look into this, it's the responsibility of people like myself.
[03:02:34.958 --> 03:02:40.684]  And just because of the curious nature of my investigative background, I always like to try to figure things out.
[03:02:40.684 --> 03:02:56.140]  And Dr. Jean Ruby, I've got to give her all of the credit, because as an international health economist, as somebody with 20 years of pharmaceutical research experience, she's not only just researching now the pharmaceuticals themselves, but why they are the way that they are.
[03:02:56.994 --> 03:02:58.176]  Why they're being hidden?
[03:02:58.176 --> 03:02:59.698]  Why they're being pushed so much?
[03:02:59.698 --> 03:03:04.765]  I mean, the curiosity amongst these doctors that are speaking out, the brave ones that we're hearing about.
[03:03:04.765 --> 03:03:08.530]  Dr. Carrie Madej, that's been on this program multiple times.
[03:03:08.530 --> 03:03:11.093]  I had her on the Stu Peters Show just recently.
[03:03:11.093 --> 03:03:12.195]  You know, Dr. Tim Penny.
[03:03:12.675 --> 03:03:32.301]  Dr. Simone Gold, Dr. Peter McCullough, I mean the names that you are familiar with and now Dr. Jean Ruby emerging on the scene as somebody who is responsibly opining on all of these things and we're going to have her on here in just a moment to talk about the relationship of two companies that are extremely close to one another and it's going to shock you.
[03:03:32.301 --> 03:03:35.322]  We've been talking about this magnetism.
[03:03:35.322 --> 03:03:37.303]  It's not a phenomenon, it's not a conspiracy.
[03:03:37.941 --> 03:03:41.203]  Thousands of people are literally sticking stuff to their face.
[03:03:41.203 --> 03:03:42.704]  They're sticking stuff to their arms.
[03:03:42.704 --> 03:03:45.967]  Now we're seeing all the videos of magnetic meat?
[03:03:45.967 --> 03:03:47.408]  This isn't a conspiracy.
[03:03:47.408 --> 03:03:48.749]  The media wants you to believe that it is.
[03:03:48.749 --> 03:03:51.131]  You're going to get banned from everywhere if you mention it.
[03:03:51.131 --> 03:03:58.176]  Instagram, Facebook, all the CCP, communist-owned and propagandized social media outlets.
[03:03:58.176 --> 03:04:01.378]  You're going to be thrown off of there, obviously, immediately if you mention magnetism.
[03:04:02.409 --> 03:04:07.413]  But there's a certain company, and I'm hearing Dr. Jane Ruby, we got a hold of her so we can bring her on right now.
[03:04:07.413 --> 03:04:11.516]  There are two companies, thank you Dr. Jane for being here, we really appreciate it.
[03:04:11.516 --> 03:04:12.377]  There's a company called...
[03:04:14.125 --> 03:04:19.790]  And then there is, they're meddling in this technology that's behind this magnetofaction.
[03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:27.676]  And the magnetofaction that you have been breaking is what drives the mRNA through the body more rapidly.
[03:04:27.676 --> 03:04:34.441]  It's an easier form, a more aggressive form of transmission through the body, which is why it's not localized to the arm anymore.
[03:04:34.441 --> 03:04:40.886]  But now we're finding people with these diagnoses like Guillain-Barré and other things, which we're going to be breaking here shortly as well.
[03:04:40.886 --> 03:04:42.948]  I mean, all this stuff is just coming across here.
[03:04:43.548 --> 03:04:49.271]  But they have an interesting relationship with another company of interest throughout this whole planned-demic.
[03:04:49.271 --> 03:04:52.392]  You uncovered this whole thing, called me from the airport.
[03:04:52.392 --> 03:04:54.613]  I want you to tell the Alex Jones listeners all about this.
[03:04:54.613 --> 03:05:04.557]  Folks, pay attention to this, because this, you just, you have to take a look at the complexity of these relationships to really understand how deep the deep state is.
[03:05:04.557 --> 03:05:07.819]  How big the globalist grip is on this world.
[03:05:07.819 --> 03:05:08.299]  Dr. Jane.
[03:05:09.631 --> 03:05:11.152]  Yeah, thanks Stu.
[03:05:11.152 --> 03:05:13.272]  Let me start a little bit from the beginning.
[03:05:13.272 --> 03:05:37.222]  When all of those people started to approach you and some of them, me as well, on this magnetic phenomenon that's happening, I did a little bit of digging and looked to see if there was any kind of a relationship and that's where we came up with the company called Chemicel that is located in Berlin and they have a very elegant website, very sophisticated, with a huge list of chemicals that assist in
[03:05:37.962 --> 03:05:39.223]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:53.612 --> 03:06:07.392]  After we aired that we had a tip from a police detective in Berlin who advises us that when he went to look at that corporation he found that the same address
[03:06:07.953 --> 03:06:14.680]  For Chemicel, same building, same operation, included the company T.I.B.
[03:06:14.680 --> 03:06:30.175]  Mobile, which is, and I previously reported slightly mistakenly, that it was owned by a Christian Drosten, but it's actually owned by a long-term friend of his named Olfort Lant, and he's the CEO of T.I.B.
[03:06:30.175 --> 03:06:30.515]  Mobile.
[03:06:30.515 --> 03:06:32.297]  And the reason this is important is because
[03:06:33.298 --> 03:06:41.826]  This is the mobile company produces the PCR kits right now that are used worldwide as well as other companies.
[03:06:41.826 --> 03:06:49.074]  And they are in the same facility as the company that produces a huge collection of magnetofection chemicals.
[03:06:49.554 --> 03:06:49.774]  Thank you.
[03:07:06.324 --> 03:07:10.409]  The UDRA Surveillance, which is the equivalent of our U.S.
[03:07:10.409 --> 03:07:11.550]  VAERS system.
[03:07:11.550 --> 03:07:16.976]  This is another organization that advises European countries on health care policy.
[03:07:16.976 --> 03:07:20.741]  So he's on this editorial board, but he published his paper.
[03:07:20.741 --> 03:07:26.828]  Second author, coincidentally, was Olfert Lant, the CEO of Mobile that makes the PCR test kits.
[03:07:27.268 --> 03:07:28.108]  We're good to go.
[03:07:45.433 --> 03:07:51.935]  We see this interlocking directorate and it's critically important that people understand this connection.
[03:07:51.935 --> 03:07:56.576]  So Christian Drosten and Olfert Lant wrote this paper.
[03:07:56.576 --> 03:08:00.336]  When you think about it, they're editors of this organization.
[03:08:00.336 --> 03:08:03.977]  They actually published their own paper through their own organization.
[03:08:03.977 --> 03:08:05.057]  That's highly unethical.
[03:08:09.262 --> 03:08:11.844]  I don't understand how any of that is legal.
[03:08:11.844 --> 03:08:26.817]  How can it be that this is like me being the expert on something and then also working for a government agency that controls that particular industry and then pushing or lobbying to the government that I work for on behalf of the people my product.
[03:08:26.817 --> 03:08:32.281]  This would be like Mike Lindell being in charge of the pillow division at the Department of Health and Safety.
[03:08:32.281 --> 03:08:34.183]  I mean it's just it's absolutely absurd.
[03:08:35.006 --> 03:08:36.527]  It's worse than that.
[03:08:36.527 --> 03:08:44.993]  If you have a journal that publishes papers on a peer review basis, that means that no scientist is above peer review.
[03:08:44.993 --> 03:08:48.515]  His or her work has to be scrutinized, criticized, rewritten.
[03:08:48.515 --> 03:08:51.417]  Many times they send the scientists back.
[03:08:51.417 --> 03:08:55.980]  In this particular case, the authors were their own reviewers.
[03:08:55.980 --> 03:08:58.042]  That's highly unethical.
[03:08:58.042 --> 03:08:59.382]  It's not done.
[03:08:59.382 --> 03:09:00.984]  Up is down, down is up, Stu.
[03:09:00.984 --> 03:09:01.484]  It's absurd.
[03:09:02.412 --> 03:09:13.635]  Yeah, I have a whistleblower that I'm going to be talking about here shortly who called me and it's in reference to some of those things, where this stuff is coming from and why it's in there.
[03:09:13.635 --> 03:09:21.057]  But there are so many questions that I have for you today and at the last minute you're making yourself available and I hope that you can stick around for the duration because
[03:09:21.517 --> 03:09:24.200]  There are a lot of messages inside of my telegram.
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:28.165]  I'm getting email after email of people who are experiencing vaccine injuries.
[03:09:28.165 --> 03:09:41.740]  Since we did Brittany Galvin on my show, who by the way if you're unfamiliar with who she is, if you're a listener of the Alex Jones Show and you don't know who Brittany Galvin is, this is a girl who she was the first patient to have a neurosurgeon that was brave enough
[03:09:42.120 --> 03:09:59.493]  To actually diagnose her with this Guillain-Barré and say that it was absolutely, unequivocally, 100% because of the Moderna shot that she contracted this very serious syndrome which could leave her paralyzed for life and ultimately could absolutely kill her.
[03:09:59.493 --> 03:10:00.214]  Guillain-Barré.
[03:10:00.214 --> 03:10:03.036]  There are also people suffering with tremors.
[03:10:03.036 --> 03:10:09.821]  There's another person that I was introduced to through Instagram, which I'm not really big over there because it's owned by the CCP, but I was contacted through there.
[03:10:09.821 --> 03:10:11.242]  I checked the message requests.
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:15.883]  There are people with these tremors now that are having cold shivers.
[03:10:15.883 --> 03:10:18.184]  These are perfectly healthy people, folks.
[03:10:18.184 --> 03:10:21.446]  And this whistleblower coming forward is a pharmacist.
[03:10:21.446 --> 03:10:27.970]  We're going to talk about her and some of the things that she said, as well as a very serious case that you just told me about.
[03:10:27.970 --> 03:10:29.651]  And that's all coming up right after the break.
[03:10:29.651 --> 03:10:30.772]  Thank you so much for sticking around.
[03:10:30.772 --> 03:10:31.492]  My name is Steve Peters.
[03:10:31.492 --> 03:10:32.553]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:33.337 --> 03:10:39.681]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?

[03:13:27.657 --> 03:13:28.558]  I love this.
[03:13:28.558 --> 03:13:30.919]  This is why I love doing this job.
[03:13:30.919 --> 03:13:38.222]  Honestly, I left 18 years as an investigator tracking down violent fugitives, investigating criminals.
[03:13:38.222 --> 03:13:39.383]  Nothing has changed.
[03:13:39.383 --> 03:13:44.365]  Still investigating criminals, but now they just wear a different uniform.
[03:13:44.365 --> 03:13:46.086]  They're of a different class.
[03:13:46.086 --> 03:13:48.828]  They're all criminals and we're exposing them.
[03:13:48.828 --> 03:13:49.408]  I love it.
[03:13:50.789 --> 03:13:57.681]  I just, what keeps me motivated, what keeps me going, because believe me, there are days that are so incredibly challenging.
[03:13:58.454 --> 03:14:07.599]  So incredibly challenging to investigate every email that we get, to look into every bit of corruption, to try to figure out if there's a story behind this or that or this person.
[03:14:07.599 --> 03:14:24.148]  I mean, we're now talking about a Republican candidate in Florida, who apparently, according to Deanna Lorraine, who was on a Stu Peters show earlier today, threatened to have Ukrainian and Russian assassins track down his opponent and murder her.
[03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:25.971]  This is really going on.
[03:14:25.971 --> 03:14:38.701]  So please, please, please tell your sheep neighbors what is really going on in this world and direct them to the truth right here at InfoWars and over at my place at StuPeters.TV.
[03:14:38.701 --> 03:14:40.342]  Dr. Jane Ruby is joining us.
[03:14:40.342 --> 03:14:44.986]  We were just talking about something that is actually extremely huge.
[03:14:44.986 --> 03:14:49.849]  Understanding how heavy that information really is.
[03:14:49.849 --> 03:14:51.711]  That the company Chemicell
[03:14:53.166 --> 03:14:56.930]  These are the people meddling in this magnetofection technology.
[03:14:56.930 --> 03:15:03.736]  While everybody in the world is denying the reality that people are magnetized after they get these injections.
[03:15:04.748 --> 03:15:09.193]  Magnetized even after not getting the injections, but being around people who are.
[03:15:09.193 --> 03:15:12.055]  And we don't know what is shedding with these people right now.
[03:15:12.055 --> 03:15:19.062]  We don't know exactly what side effects or what symptoms you might experience through this shedding or this transmission.
[03:15:19.062 --> 03:15:26.310]  We do know that they told us that these things were going to be self-transmitting, that they were going to be basically contagious, that they were developing this years ago.
[03:15:26.890 --> 03:15:29.251]  But they want you to believe that none of this is true.
[03:15:29.251 --> 03:15:39.876]  They want you to ignore what your eyes are seeing, ignore what your ears are hearing, and completely disregard the thousands of self-recorded videos that you see on the CCP-controlled TikTok or over on Instagram.
[03:15:39.876 --> 03:15:40.956]  It's ridiculous.
[03:15:40.956 --> 03:15:51.361]  Chemicel, the company that is meddling in the technology for the Magnetofection, which Dr. Jane Ruby broke and exposed, was intentionally added to these vaccines.
[03:15:51.361 --> 03:15:53.762]  Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, all of them,
[03:15:54.543 --> 03:16:02.247]  Is in the same building, same suite, with the people that are responsible for manufacturing PCR test kits.
[03:16:02.247 --> 03:16:03.228]  Absolutely insane.
[03:16:03.228 --> 03:16:12.613]  Now, Dr. Ruby telling me during the break, the first confirmed case of multiple sclerosis documented direct result of the Pfizer jab.
[03:16:14.736 --> 03:16:22.778]  Sue, the numbers are exploding of all kinds of what we know as autoimmune diseases.
[03:16:22.778 --> 03:16:27.640]  MS or multiple sclerosis is one of those autoimmune diseases.
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:31.701]  In this disease, the body attacks its own myelin.
[03:16:31.701 --> 03:16:35.982]  Your myelin is the sheath covering over your brain and spinal cord.
[03:16:35.982 --> 03:16:42.644]  Imagine if you have a process that starts multiple sclerosis and then you add on top of that
[03:16:43.524 --> 03:16:48.166]  booster shots of these injections to advance the MS.
[03:16:48.166 --> 03:17:00.791]  No wonder people like Brittany who has another form of autoimmune disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, no wonder she's having trouble walking, a 30-something-year-old mother of three.
[03:17:00.791 --> 03:17:05.973]  What basically happens is we know the spike proteins are going everywhere.
[03:17:05.973 --> 03:17:10.355]  We've been told that this injection doesn't leave the injection site.
[03:17:10.735 --> 03:17:25.310]  And yet at the same time we're reading all kinds of reports that the spike proteins that the injections delivery of mRNA molecule forces your body to make are being found in all kinds of organs and other places in your body.
[03:17:25.310 --> 03:17:33.619]  So it's not, in fact, the magnetofection process when added to the lipid nanoparticles actually drives
[03:17:34.259 --> 03:17:41.662]  It's a stronger delivery system to get this to every cell in the body because it breaks through natural barriers.
[03:17:41.662 --> 03:17:44.943]  The most famous barrier everyone knows is the blood-brain barrier.
[03:17:44.943 --> 03:17:57.547]  Not everything is supposed to get through the brain, as you can imagine, but putting this nanoparticle and charging it with magnetofection ensures that it goes past those lipid barriers, and that's what's happening here.
[03:17:58.127 --> 03:18:08.911]  Sue, I wanted to also share with you and the viewers that something else is happening, especially that we're being lied to about the fact that these are supposedly not leaving the injection site.
[03:18:08.911 --> 03:18:13.773]  There was a report and we're still getting more information on it, that there are changes
[03:18:14.053 --> 03:18:18.936]  The shape and morphology of your blood cells.
[03:18:18.936 --> 03:18:30.282]  I provided your producers with a photograph that shows four different photographs from something called dark field microscopy.
[03:18:30.282 --> 03:18:40.588]  And this is like a deep microscope that is able to ferret out unnecessary light to give you a more specific look
[03:18:41.028 --> 03:18:41.608]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:04.315 --> 03:19:12.261]  And so they looked at that person's blood several days after they were injected with the second shot.
[03:19:12.261 --> 03:19:20.647]  What you're seeing in the picture to the right, in the upper right-hand corner, are the blood cells several days after the shot.
[03:19:20.647 --> 03:19:24.870]  You can see that they're not smooth and round the way red blood cells are supposed to be.
[03:19:26.770 --> 03:19:29.312]  I've seen some stuff going on on the screen.
[03:19:29.312 --> 03:19:34.255]  We're operating out of a different studio here today, so I think that there's just some issues pulling that up.
[03:19:34.255 --> 03:19:39.839]  But I will make sure that we get that up on the website as well, so that people can understand what it is that you're referring to.
[03:19:39.839 --> 03:19:42.941]  But they definitely change your blood cells.
[03:19:42.941 --> 03:19:44.682]  We're being lied to in that regard.
[03:19:44.682 --> 03:19:47.244]  These things actually change your blood cells.
[03:19:47.244 --> 03:19:48.625]  They damage cells.
[03:19:50.433 --> 03:19:52.034]  Yes, that's what I'm explaining.
[03:19:52.034 --> 03:19:57.258]  They changed the shape, which is the morphology of your red blood cells.
[03:19:57.258 --> 03:20:06.825]  It looks like the nucleus has been damaged because you see it's, when you get to see the photo, the nucleus of the red blood cells becomes very whitened and enlarged.
[03:20:06.825 --> 03:20:10.328]  That tells me there's a high inflammatory process going on.
[03:20:10.328 --> 03:20:17.874]  And then in a third picture, you can see a lot of white specks that are surrounding the plasma around those red blood cells.
[03:20:18.314 --> 03:20:26.703]  And the blood cells themselves, and those are the lipid nanoparticles that are just profusely and ubiquitously throughout the bloodstream.
[03:20:26.703 --> 03:20:36.973]  So again, you know, and then the fourth picture, just for future reference, is the red blood cells with these, it looks like embedded particles in them.
[03:20:36.973 --> 03:20:41.458]  Don't tell me that this material that's being injected from these shots
[03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:56.424]  25 people died as a result of the swine flu vaccination program.
[03:20:56.424 --> 03:20:57.184]  25 people.
[03:20:57.184 --> 03:20:58.925]  It was immediately halted.
[03:20:58.925 --> 03:21:00.625]  We've talked about this at nauseam.
[03:21:00.625 --> 03:21:04.167]  I know that you guys have this information, but this has to sink in.
[03:21:04.167 --> 03:21:06.107]  This has to resonate with the people that you know.
[03:21:08.214 --> 03:21:09.996]  Right outside of pharmacies.
[03:21:09.996 --> 03:21:13.961]  I'm thinking about standing right outside of the CVS with a big sign and just warning people.
[03:21:13.961 --> 03:21:18.327]  I feel like it's almost my duty to stand there and tell people exactly what's going on.
[03:21:18.327 --> 03:21:22.112]  And we only have about 45 seconds left here in this segment, but if you have something quick...
[03:21:23.412 --> 03:21:32.641]  When the famous antidepressant drug Selexa was being tested in animal studies in the 80s, six beagle dogs died of heart attacks.
[03:21:32.641 --> 03:21:38.847]  Stu, they shut that program down for six dead dogs before they even got to humans.
[03:21:38.847 --> 03:21:43.191]  We have over 6,000, and that's a conservative estimate, dead in the United States.
[03:21:43.191 --> 03:21:43.912]  What are we doing?
[03:21:44.761 --> 03:21:46.682]  Could be 60,000 or 600,000.
[03:21:46.682 --> 03:21:54.228]  If you follow the Harvard study, we know that 1% or less of these things are actually accurately reported to VAERS because it's a very complicated system.
[03:21:54.228 --> 03:21:56.709]  And they're screwing with those numbers over there as well.
[03:21:56.709 --> 03:22:01.333]  I'm going to talk to you about why this is all happening and where the doctors are coming up next.
[03:22:01.333 --> 03:22:01.773]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:22:01.773 --> 03:22:02.634]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:02.634 --> 03:22:03.334]  My name is Stu Peter.
[03:22:03.334 --> 03:22:10.199]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:22:10.757 --> 03:22:16.278]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:22:16.278 --> 03:22:24.139]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:22:24.139 --> 03:22:25.600]  Humanity is strong.
[03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:26.560]  We're incredible.
[03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:30.340]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:22:30.340 --> 03:22:32.801]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:22:32.801 --> 03:22:38.742]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:22:39.182 --> 03:22:48.806]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:22:48.806 --> 03:22:51.128]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:22:51.128 --> 03:22:53.789]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:22:53.789 --> 03:22:59.111]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[03:22:59.111 --> 03:23:03.093]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[03:23:04.344 --> 03:23:08.427]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[03:23:08.427 --> 03:23:09.928]  Well, I'm trying to be a good man.
[03:23:09.928 --> 03:23:11.229]  I'm trying to stand up and do the right thing.
[03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:16.312]  And I've seen huge effects with what we've done here at InfoWars.
[03:23:16.312 --> 03:23:21.315]  Other good men and women getting together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption.
[03:23:21.315 --> 03:23:23.157]  But now the globals are coming after us.
[03:23:23.157 --> 03:23:24.438]  And so I need your prayers.
[03:23:24.438 --> 03:23:25.838]  I need your financial support.
[03:23:25.838 --> 03:23:27.780]  I need your word of mouth to stay in the fight.
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:29.881]  We've got a big sale going right now.
[03:23:29.881 --> 03:23:32.543]  Free shipping, double Patriot points on three items that have been sold out.
[03:23:34.104 --> 03:23:34.444]  I think so.
[03:24:04.387 --> 03:24:11.093]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the scientific literature is overwhelming.
[03:24:11.093 --> 03:24:14.677]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[03:24:14.677 --> 03:24:17.119]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[03:24:17.119 --> 03:24:19.221]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it.
[03:24:19.221 --> 03:24:21.883]  It's well known for the things it does for our body.
[03:24:21.883 --> 03:24:23.665]  It makes our lives so much better.
[03:24:24.445 --> 03:24:28.289]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[03:24:28.289 --> 03:24:30.231]  We've got both at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:24:30.231 --> 03:24:36.797]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back in stock.
[03:24:36.797 --> 03:24:38.518]  Well, it's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:38.518 --> 03:24:47.627]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:24:48.007 --> 03:24:50.190]  With free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:24:50.190 --> 03:24:53.515]  Because I want those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it.
[03:24:53.515 --> 03:24:56.840]  And I want new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us.
[03:24:56.840 --> 03:25:01.227]  And then try regular crenel oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[03:25:01.227 --> 03:25:03.751]  This is the highest grade pack of stock at FortWorthStore.com.
[03:25:05.602 --> 03:25:09.263]  Infowars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:11.884]  That's why it's been our motto for more than 25 years.
[03:25:11.884 --> 03:25:22.826]  And if you research even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[03:25:22.826 --> 03:25:27.067]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[03:25:27.067 --> 03:25:32.169]  Now regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals.
[03:25:32.169 --> 03:25:33.869]  And so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[03:25:34.409 --> 03:25:39.493]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[03:25:39.493 --> 03:25:41.094]  It's essential in the body.
[03:25:41.094 --> 03:25:48.258]  But we have our amazing Tri-Iodine, a big shipment came in, and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[03:25:48.258 --> 03:25:53.902]  That is Survival Shield X3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[03:25:53.902 --> 03:26:00.346]  Tri-Iodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine and makes it even more powerful at the cellular level.
[03:26:00.346 --> 03:26:01.587]  You and your family will love it.
[03:26:01.587 --> 03:26:02.648]  It's incredible for your body.
[03:26:02.648 --> 03:26:04.129]  Get it at InfoWareStore.com today.
[03:26:07.457 --> 03:26:10.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:26:25.889 --> 03:26:27.610]  Stu Peters, StuPeters.TV.
[03:26:27.610 --> 03:26:28.811]  Check me out, I'd appreciate it.
[03:26:28.811 --> 03:26:30.753]  Come on over anytime.
[03:26:30.753 --> 03:26:33.494]  Much similar, we do nothing but truth.
[03:26:33.494 --> 03:26:40.039]  And although the topics may overlap every once in a while, Alex can't keep track of me, nor can I keep track of what he's doing.
[03:26:40.039 --> 03:26:43.341]  And if I'm being redundant or repetitive, I apologize.
[03:26:43.341 --> 03:26:53.167]  Breaking over there right now, today a senator in Minnesota here actually sent a threatening email to a voter that requested a forensic audit of the 2020 election here.
[03:26:53.167 --> 03:26:55.209]  Very polite, but very persistent.
[03:26:55.729 --> 03:27:06.976]  She sent an email to Minnesota Senator Jim Carlson in response to her requesting a forensic audit of the 2020 election here in the state of Minnesota.
[03:27:06.976 --> 03:27:09.457]  This guy at 1247 a.m.
[03:27:09.457 --> 03:27:12.199]  Now I don't know about you, I'm sleeping at 1247 a.m.
[03:27:12.199 --> 03:27:16.302]  but conveniently that's right around bar close here in the state of Minnesota as well.
[03:27:16.302 --> 03:27:23.786]  I don't know what Jim Carlson is into, if the senator was on a drunken stupor or what he was doing, but he starts emailing her back at 1247 a.m.
[03:27:25.607 --> 03:27:28.931]  It ended up with threatening emails from him to her.
[03:27:28.931 --> 03:27:31.013]  That story is at StuPeters.TV.
[03:27:31.013 --> 03:27:32.074]  I know where you live.
[03:27:32.074 --> 03:27:33.836]  I know everything about you.
[03:27:33.836 --> 03:27:35.218]  I know where your family is.
[03:27:36.787 --> 03:27:59.308]  Scary world that we live in right now, and you know, these people that are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of protecting you and the voice of the people, their very job is to go and represent the voices of their constituents, to take care of the concerns that their constituents have, and rather than that, instead he turns around and says that he knows where she lives, and that she better stop emailing him.
[03:27:59.788 --> 03:28:00.689]  Very polite.
[03:28:00.689 --> 03:28:03.912]  You'll see all the emails over there at StuPeters.tv.
[03:28:03.912 --> 03:28:05.453]  We have Dr. Jane Ruby on here.
[03:28:05.453 --> 03:28:08.275]  We were talking about MS before we went to break.
[03:28:08.275 --> 03:28:12.799]  Two or six beagle dogs died as a result of an injection.
[03:28:12.799 --> 03:28:15.141]  They immediately halted that vaccine process.
[03:28:16.222 --> 03:28:18.565]  25 people die in a swine flu.
[03:28:18.565 --> 03:28:19.806]  They immediately halt that.
[03:28:19.806 --> 03:28:32.520]  We have upwards of possibly 600,000 people injured or dead as a result of this inoculation, this vaccine, which we're going to talk about specifically exactly how hidden the contents of this thing really are.
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:34.723]  But first you wanted to touch a little bit more on this MS.
[03:28:36.434 --> 03:28:53.608]  I believe I got word that the producers were able to locate that photo that is really helpful showing the differences in the blood, the red blood cells of people who have been injected with any of these four injections, Stu.
[03:28:53.608 --> 03:28:59.132]  And what we're seeing in the upper left-hand corner is a collection of normal red blood cells.
[03:28:59.132 --> 03:29:01.634]  They're nice and round, they're healthy, they're plump.
[03:29:02.515 --> 03:29:09.181]  They're filled with the red ferritin, iron that carries your oxygen.
[03:29:09.181 --> 03:29:18.810]  In the upper right-hand corner, you're seeing the beginning several days after the second injection of one of these injections.
[03:29:18.810 --> 03:29:23.814]  You can see that the shape is changing, becoming very abnormal, spotty around the edges.
[03:29:23.814 --> 03:29:24.675]  They're not round.
[03:29:24.675 --> 03:29:26.697]  The inner nucleus looks inflamed.
[03:29:27.497 --> 03:29:29.378]  It's white and widened.
[03:29:29.378 --> 03:29:37.282]  And in the lower left-hand corner, you're seeing, probably after about five days, this is by, like I said before, dark field microscopy.
[03:29:37.282 --> 03:29:42.825]  In the lower left-hand corner, you see a lot of these dots and kind of irregularities on the outside.
[03:29:42.825 --> 03:29:45.546]  These are the red blood cells fighting for their lives.
[03:29:45.546 --> 03:29:50.368]  In the bottom right corner, you see all these white specks.
[03:29:50.368 --> 03:29:53.370]  Those are believed to be the lipid nanoparticles.
[03:29:53.370 --> 03:29:56.091]  Don't tell me that these injections stay at the injection site!
[03:29:56.711 --> 03:30:00.352]  And they're not only surrounding the red blood cells, they're damaging them.
[03:30:00.352 --> 03:30:02.933]  You can see an inflammatory process.
[03:30:02.933 --> 03:30:05.994]  There's like a war on for our blood.
[03:30:05.994 --> 03:30:12.416]  We are verifying with the person who ran these tests and hopefully get them on the show soon if possible.
[03:30:12.416 --> 03:30:16.377]  And I really want to send my thanks to the producers for getting this up and running.
[03:30:16.377 --> 03:30:19.658]  I think it's a really powerful photograph that should speak volumes.
[03:30:19.918 --> 03:30:20.918]  They're incredible.
[03:30:20.918 --> 03:30:22.019]  And you're right.
[03:30:22.019 --> 03:30:22.639]  They're lying.
[03:30:22.639 --> 03:30:37.443]  This should be the duty of medical professionals, of doctors, of pharmacists, of people, anybody that's responsible for injecting this stuff into the bloodstream of unsuspecting Americans who have no idea.
[03:30:37.443 --> 03:30:40.384]  You can't really necessarily blame them.
[03:30:40.384 --> 03:30:41.204]  They have no idea.
[03:30:41.204 --> 03:30:42.725]  They go home after a long day at work.
[03:30:42.725 --> 03:30:43.605]  They turn on the TV.
[03:30:43.605 --> 03:30:49.707]  They listen to their evening news without any clue whatsoever that this whole thing has been hijacked.
[03:30:49.947 --> 03:30:56.889]  They don't know that the same six corporations own Fox's own MSNBC or CNN, that they're all reading from the same exact script.
[03:30:56.889 --> 03:31:03.831]  I challenge anybody, if you don't believe me, when you have 15 minutes of time, sit down in your living room and turn them on.
[03:31:03.831 --> 03:31:04.691]  Turn on the different channel.
[03:31:04.691 --> 03:31:05.352]  You will listen to them.
[03:31:05.352 --> 03:31:10.493]  They're reading the exact, not only similar messages, verbatim.
[03:31:10.493 --> 03:31:12.914]  They're saying the same words.
[03:31:12.914 --> 03:31:15.795]  So you can't blame these people, but what about these medical professionals?
[03:31:15.795 --> 03:31:19.356]  Why are doctors, Dr. Jane Ruby, continuing
[03:31:20.191 --> 03:31:33.200]  To give this thing to people, knowing that this information is out there, knowing that 5,000 or 5,500 or 6,000 are reported to VAERS, they don't even have to take the Harvard study into account.
[03:31:33.200 --> 03:31:38.344]  I mean, if 6,000 is the number, we're stopping something for six beagles, for crying out loud.
[03:31:38.344 --> 03:31:40.005]  Why are they still injecting these people?
[03:31:41.229 --> 03:31:43.409]  Sue, this is a very good question.
[03:31:43.409 --> 03:31:44.750]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:46.590]  You touched on something earlier.
[03:31:46.590 --> 03:31:54.812]  People have been relying on the good faith and trust in physicians and nurses and pharmacists for centuries.
[03:31:54.812 --> 03:31:56.032]  Why is this happening?
[03:31:56.032 --> 03:31:58.633]  I have coined the phrase zombie doctor.
[03:31:58.633 --> 03:31:59.313]  Why?
[03:31:59.313 --> 03:32:04.734]  Because so many American physicians and physicians outside of the United States
[03:32:05.334 --> 03:32:11.658]  So many physicians are just blindly telling their patients, oh, go get the shot.
[03:32:11.658 --> 03:32:13.679]  It's perfectly safe for everyone.
[03:32:13.679 --> 03:32:18.302]  I've told them to push back on their doctors and ask, well, is there anybody this isn't safe for?
[03:32:18.302 --> 03:32:22.304]  Because, Stu, there's nothing in the world that's 100% safe.
[03:32:22.304 --> 03:32:33.130]  So I coined the term zombie doctors and I've sent out pictures of doctors, they're zombies, drenched in blood, holding up needles and coming after you because doctors have a responsibility
[03:32:33.832 --> 03:32:37.616]  To look at the literature before recommending something.
[03:32:37.616 --> 03:32:41.839]  And to answer your question, Stu, there are only two reasons why this is happening.
[03:32:41.839 --> 03:32:45.643]  One, doctors are ignorant or lazy and they're not doing the research.
[03:32:45.643 --> 03:32:54.110]  They're not looking at the same studies that I can find in the public domain to look at the dangers and look at what this injection is really made of.
[03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:58.855]  And that is dereliction of duty and the highest order of a violation of the Hippocratic Oath ever.
[03:32:59.836 --> 03:33:05.922]  Or, even worse, in my mind, although I think they're both equally worse, these doctors are being paid.
[03:33:05.922 --> 03:33:07.303]  How are they being paid?
[03:33:07.303 --> 03:33:12.528]  They're being paid, they're incentivized by the pharma companies through grants.
[03:33:12.528 --> 03:33:17.593]  And these things are all kind of hidden and wrapped around and they get around federal regs.
[03:33:18.113 --> 03:33:30.842]  Or, I've seen insurance companies like Blue Cross and Blue Shield actually provide bonuses for a certain percentage of the doctor's patient population inoculated.
[03:33:30.842 --> 03:33:36.746]  Sue, these are in direct violation of all ten of the Nuremberg Codes.
[03:33:36.746 --> 03:33:37.666]  And it's got to stop.
[03:33:37.666 --> 03:33:43.310]  And I'm calling attention to zombie doctors because I want doctors to start taking responsibility.
[03:33:43.730 --> 03:33:53.735]  My own doctor down here, when I moved to Florida, just recently, great doctor, great examination at the very end, said, you know, you really ought to think about taking the vaccination.
[03:33:53.735 --> 03:34:05.080]  Well, she said that to the wrong person, and when I laid it all out for her in about 90 seconds, her reply, she had a look of shock on her face, and her reply was, oh my, I guess I better go back and do some reading.
[03:34:05.080 --> 03:34:10.063]  Totally oblivious to the fact that this was not a vaccine, and drinking the Kool-Aid of the CDC.
[03:34:10.953 --> 03:34:11.213]  I think?
[03:34:33.832 --> 03:34:43.966]  So why in the hell would you allow somebody, a total stranger, to inject something directly into you that has the same or worse odds?
[03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:46.592]  Because they're wearing a lab coat.
[03:34:46.592 --> 03:34:49.334]  That is why people have entrusted these doctors.
[03:34:49.334 --> 03:35:09.309]  And I'm telling you, if what you're saying is true, and if we find out that these doctors are being compensated, we already know it to be true, but if it can be proven, and if the media will grab a hold of this, and if 300 million people or more in this country can come to the realization that these doctors have been intentionally lying to them for money, can you imagine the falling out?
[03:35:09.309 --> 03:35:11.671]  Can you imagine what might happen to these doctors?
[03:35:11.671 --> 03:35:12.872]  My God, I would have to pray for them.
[03:35:13.835 --> 03:35:19.921]  Sue, doctors are obligated to report all money they receive from pharma companies in something called the Sunshine Act.
[03:35:19.921 --> 03:35:21.102]  So it's very easy to prove.
[03:35:21.102 --> 03:35:24.465]  And what I'm worried about, as we close here, are the children.
[03:35:24.465 --> 03:35:31.071]  These pediatricians that are coming out and saying, yes, inject them as low as birth, two or three months old.
[03:35:31.071 --> 03:35:32.192]  Sue, this has got to stop.
[03:35:32.192 --> 03:35:33.273]  We've got to save the children.
[03:35:34.326 --> 03:35:40.493]  Well, we're not closing because I've got amazing information on a whistleblower.
[03:35:40.493 --> 03:35:46.380]  She is a pharmacist, okay, and she has come forward.
[03:35:46.380 --> 03:35:51.566]  I'm not ready to release what she has, but there's an amazing phenomenon going on here that she told me about.
[03:35:52.266 --> 03:35:53.647]  And I want to talk to you about that.
[03:35:53.647 --> 03:35:56.869]  If you have the time to stick around, I would like to have you on for just one more segment.
[03:35:56.869 --> 03:35:58.711]  Dr. Gene Ruby joins us.
[03:35:58.711 --> 03:36:00.712]  This is the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars.
[03:36:00.712 --> 03:36:02.313]  My name is Stu Peters at StuPeters.TV.
[03:36:02.313 --> 03:36:03.294]  We'll be back in a second.
[03:36:03.294 --> 03:36:11.759]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:11.759 --> 03:36:21.806]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effect.
[03:36:22.266 --> 03:36:22.807]  We're good to go.
[03:36:38.238 --> 03:36:43.101]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:36:43.101 --> 03:36:55.789]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Chamomile, Organic Skullcap, and Bavarian Root.
[03:36:55.789 --> 03:37:02.113]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[03:37:03.675 --> 03:37:10.439]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[03:37:10.439 --> 03:37:16.242]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs.
[03:37:16.242 --> 03:37:21.825]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs.
[03:37:21.825 --> 03:37:24.647]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[03:37:24.647 --> 03:37:26.828]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[03:37:27.448 --> 03:37:30.670]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:34.371]  It's a death cult, and it's up to the individual to escape.
[03:37:34.371 --> 03:37:40.494]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[03:37:40.494 --> 03:37:43.756]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[03:37:44.457 --> 03:37:53.808]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune system.
[03:37:53.808 --> 03:38:00.657]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the Mega Immune Support Pack.

[03:38:04.511 --> 03:38:16.536]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms and degrade targeted pollutants.
[03:38:16.536 --> 03:38:23.618]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[03:38:23.618 --> 03:38:30.821]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[03:38:30.821 --> 03:38:33.202]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms
[03:38:33.462 --> 03:38:35.364]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does
[03:39:01.446 --> 03:39:08.270]  People pat me on the back all the time, and I really, really appreciate it.
[03:39:08.270 --> 03:39:09.671]  But I want you to understand something.
[03:39:09.671 --> 03:39:12.433]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here.
[03:39:12.433 --> 03:39:16.776]  Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here.
[03:39:16.776 --> 03:39:26.422]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't spreading the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore, and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the New World Order like we have right now.

[03:39:42.473 --> 03:39:44.615]  We're going to defeat the globalists, but it's not going to happen easy.
[03:39:44.615 --> 03:39:47.097]  We need God on our side, we've got to take action.

[03:40:27.378 --> 03:40:29.440]  Please come and find me at StuPeters.tv.
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:34.324]  I love you guys and I really appreciate you having me here every Friday in this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:34.324 --> 03:40:35.385]  My name is Stu Peters.
[03:40:35.385 --> 03:40:42.832]  If there's one thing that we have failed to do, I think, in times past, in my humble and honest opinion...
[03:40:44.501 --> 03:41:03.944]  One of our biggest downfalls, Dr. Jane, is that we have failed to give credit to the enemy for their ability to plan, for their ability to orchestrate, for their ability to stick together, to maintain a narrative, to project propaganda, to slowly infiltrate every aspect of our lives without firing a single shot.
[03:41:04.324 --> 03:41:05.585]  Without being detected.
[03:41:05.585 --> 03:41:06.627]  Completely quiet.
[03:41:06.627 --> 03:41:07.908]  They're like little termites.
[03:41:07.908 --> 03:41:13.373]  And they have been gnawing away at the foundation of this country for an incredibly long time.
[03:41:13.373 --> 03:41:17.137]  And now, they're going after our kids.
[03:41:17.137 --> 03:41:23.543]  And when these people say that this emergency use authorization goes down to as young as age 12,
[03:41:24.764 --> 03:41:28.806]  There are certain pharmacists, because there are many of us who are a part of this great awakening.
[03:41:28.806 --> 03:41:31.808]  There are many of us whose eyes have been incredibly open.
[03:41:31.808 --> 03:41:34.449]  I had no idea that a lot of this stuff was going on.
[03:41:34.449 --> 03:41:35.790]  I really didn't.
[03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:41.253]  And if there's one thing that I can credit Donald J. Trump for, it was making me question everything.
[03:41:41.253 --> 03:41:42.994]  And I give him a lot of credit for a lot of things.
[03:41:42.994 --> 03:41:49.538]  That's just one of the biggest things, I think, is that I literally question everything and I consider absolutely everything to be a possibility.
[03:41:50.347 --> 03:41:56.774]  But this little infestation of these termites has now become a catastrophic complication for our kids.
[03:41:56.774 --> 03:42:10.607]  As parents and grandparents are literally walking these kids straight into a CVS, straight into a Walgreens or whatever pharmacy you go to, straight into a doctor's office to grab this jab because they're afraid of COVID.
[03:42:10.607 --> 03:42:11.668]  They're afraid of COVID-19.
[03:42:13.132 --> 03:42:16.018]  You have told us before, viruses burn down, not up.
[03:42:16.018 --> 03:42:18.562]  As far as I'm concerned, the whole COVID thing is dead.
[03:42:18.562 --> 03:42:19.063]  It's gone.
[03:42:19.063 --> 03:42:19.705]  It's over with.
[03:42:19.705 --> 03:42:20.847]  There is no pandemic.
[03:42:21.548 --> 03:42:46.750]  And when people start suing these states, when people start suing their governors, their attorneys general, for enforcing these lockdown mandates, when they start suing them for being fired from their jobs, for refusing to get inoculated, when they start suing these people, the one thing that they will have to do when they subpoena these attorneys general and these governors is the one thing that I would encourage them to do, and Lewis Ewing would also encourage this,
[03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:52.794]  They have to prove that there is an active pandemic.
[03:42:52.794 --> 03:42:54.215]  And I don't know that they can do that.
[03:42:54.215 --> 03:42:56.537]  But nonetheless, we have these people going in.
[03:42:56.537 --> 03:43:01.660]  And so, Dr. Jane, I was contacted in my ProtonMail by a pharmacist.
[03:43:01.660 --> 03:43:04.582]  I've got to be really careful here because I don't want to expose this person.
[03:43:04.582 --> 03:43:07.484]  We're talking hidden cameras and all kinds of stuff.
[03:43:07.484 --> 03:43:14.049]  But this person who originally contacted me has been working at a pharmacy and has been jabbing people.
[03:43:15.786 --> 03:43:35.608]  As she woke up and started realizing what it is that's going on, and it was, I'll take credit for it, she found my telegram channel, and she found you, and so she's like, whoa, this is really going on, and she started doing her own research, and she found out, oh my holy smokes, and it really blew her mind that she has been participating in this, and she was ready to walk
[03:43:36.583 --> 03:43:49.504]  And, you know, she was considering walking, and then she was considering participating in some way, shape, or form, and she came to the conclusion on her own, if I were to leave right now, somebody else would just fill my shoes.
[03:43:50.191 --> 03:43:52.072]  So I'm going to stay and I'm going to do the right thing.
[03:43:52.072 --> 03:43:54.494]  In every war and every battle, there is collateral damage.
[03:43:54.494 --> 03:43:56.235]  There are innocent people that die and perish.
[03:43:56.235 --> 03:43:59.598]  There are casualties that are untargeted people.
[03:43:59.598 --> 03:44:01.519]  And unfortunately, those are the times that we're in.
[03:44:01.519 --> 03:44:07.823]  It's really a horrifying place that we're in, in this country right now, when you actually sit down and think about it.
[03:44:07.823 --> 03:44:12.747]  These are people's lives that we're talking about, and these kids.
[03:44:12.747 --> 03:44:13.047]  And so,
[03:44:14.551 --> 03:44:24.514]  In conversation with her, she told me that she learned yesterday that there are 20 pharmacists at her chain, or whatever, that are leaving.
[03:44:24.514 --> 03:44:26.495]  And then I started doing some research on that.
[03:44:26.495 --> 03:44:32.596]  There was an article just yesterday, I don't remember where I saw it, but 20 CVS people are leaving.
[03:44:32.596 --> 03:44:38.358]  There's whistleblowers coming out and saying, you know, that we don't know what we're injecting in these people.
[03:44:39.272 --> 03:44:41.114]  I want to talk about something.
[03:44:41.114 --> 03:44:43.877]  I want to ask you about these inserts.
[03:44:43.877 --> 03:44:44.637]  Whatever they're called.
[03:44:44.637 --> 03:44:51.945]  These pieces of paper that come inside of the box or the lot where these injections are sent to the pharmacists.
[03:44:52.956 --> 03:44:57.879]  These things, just like any other medication, have an insert, and that insert is supposed to list ingredients.
[03:44:57.879 --> 03:45:01.481]  I'm being told that they are intentionally blank, and I've seen them.
[03:45:01.481 --> 03:45:01.901]  They are.
[03:45:01.901 --> 03:45:02.662]  They're blank.
[03:45:02.662 --> 03:45:04.383]  Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson.
[03:45:04.383 --> 03:45:06.044]  How important is this piece of paper?
[03:45:06.044 --> 03:45:16.470]  Am I just overthinking this, or is that alarming to you, as a pharmaceutical researcher expert, that these things are blank?
[03:45:18.786 --> 03:45:25.671]  Sue, when people understand what that piece of paper is, they are going to be, I hope, very angry.
[03:45:25.671 --> 03:45:30.294]  That piece of paper is called the package insert.
[03:45:30.294 --> 03:45:36.418]  That's the little piece of paper that most of us throw out when we open up our new aspirin or Advil bottle.
[03:45:39.513 --> 03:45:40.953]  That's called the package insert.
[03:45:40.953 --> 03:45:51.416]  That's actually a legal document that I can tell you from the beginning is hammered out between the pharmaceutical company and the FDA.
[03:45:51.416 --> 03:46:00.058]  Every word, I'm telling you every number, every punctuation mark is negotiated and approved by the FDA or it cannot be in that
[03:46:00.718 --> 03:46:01.499]  Insert.
[03:46:01.499 --> 03:46:04.601]  And it is based on the studies.
[03:46:04.601 --> 03:46:14.989]  And that package insert, if you look the next time of any other drug, you will see that there are studies in there with graphs, there are warnings to doctors, there are warnings to patients.
[03:46:14.989 --> 03:46:17.971]  The package insert is a legal document.
[03:46:17.971 --> 03:46:26.998]  The fact that these vials of these four injections are being circulated throughout the United States and in the world with blank pieces of paper
[03:46:27.618 --> 03:46:29.159]  It is an outrage.
[03:46:29.159 --> 03:46:31.319]  It is a dereliction of duty.
[03:46:31.319 --> 03:46:42.504]  It is the most incredibly corrupt thing that is going on that the FDA is not insisting on even a temporary package insert.
[03:46:42.504 --> 03:46:43.824]  It's also called the label.
[03:46:43.824 --> 03:46:45.705]  The label is a legal document.
[03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:56.868]  To have nothing at all, that means you have no information on the lot number, you have no information on safety, you have no information on efficacy, how efficacious it was.
[03:46:56.868 --> 03:47:05.254]  All we have are public statements and these pharma companies will not respond to the questions that normally would have been answered by these package inserts.
[03:47:06.775 --> 03:47:13.778]  ...that we are getting are from the people whose names are on the patents, from the investors who have a financial stake in this game.
[03:47:13.778 --> 03:47:19.701]  I mentioned it would be like Mike Lindell doing the, you know, the pillow issuance for the government, on behalf of the government.
[03:47:19.701 --> 03:47:30.726]  These people's names are clearly printed, publicly discoverable, right on the patent information that's behind the mRNA technology, that's behind this magnetofection, and that's behind the injection itself.
[03:47:30.726 --> 03:47:31.967]  Bill Gates, Anthony Fauci.
[03:47:32.347 --> 03:47:41.770]  The same people, at least one of them, who funded the lab that I and everybody else that's truthful was called a liar for speculating that that was the lab in Wuhan where it leaked from.
[03:47:41.770 --> 03:47:47.552]  Now I'm speculating and have almost pretty positive circumstantial evidence that this thing was engineered.
[03:47:47.552 --> 03:47:52.554]  This is why Fauci was consistently emailing a woman by the name of Christina Cassetti.
[03:47:52.554 --> 03:47:56.536]  Christina Cassetti spent the last eight years of her life in Italy doing guess what?
[03:47:56.536 --> 03:47:57.556]  Engineering viruses.
[03:47:57.976 --> 03:48:03.560]  Why was he sending her chlorine dioxide or nitric oxide and saying, hey, I need you to take care of this.
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:04.741]  Make this go away.
[03:48:04.741 --> 03:48:06.462]  It was a viable treatment.
[03:48:06.462 --> 03:48:07.803]  It was a cure.
[03:48:07.803 --> 03:48:11.206]  Essentially, it made the SARS-CoV-2 virus die.
[03:48:11.206 --> 03:48:12.807]  It stopped it from spreading.
[03:48:12.807 --> 03:48:14.988]  These are the very people that are responsible.
[03:48:14.988 --> 03:48:23.434]  So, going back to the leaflets, the inserts, could it be possible that you mentioned that everything is negotiated or approved by the FDA that goes into these things.
[03:48:23.434 --> 03:48:25.616]  Every punctuation mark, every space, every letter.
[03:48:26.176 --> 03:48:30.681]  Is it possible that these are left blank because of the fact that this doesn't have FDA approval?
[03:48:30.681 --> 03:48:35.326]  And do you expect this thing, in about a minute or less, to ever eventually get FDA approval?
[03:48:35.326 --> 03:48:35.907]  Yeah, there she is.
[03:48:35.907 --> 03:48:37.909]  There's one of those pharmacists right there.
[03:48:37.909 --> 03:48:41.914]  This thing is 100% when she opens it up, it's 100% blank.
[03:48:41.914 --> 03:48:43.736]  Will this thing be FDA approved, Dr. Ruby?
[03:48:44.668 --> 03:48:52.255]  My opinion is that the reason these are blank is because, Stu, they didn't do the safety studies in humans.
[03:48:52.255 --> 03:48:55.417]  They didn't run the pharmacokinetic studies on humans.
[03:48:55.417 --> 03:49:03.204]  Pharmacokinetics are the study of, there are about 100 tests in there, but there are about 12 standard ones we expect to see in a package insert.
[03:49:03.204 --> 03:49:05.886]  And that is, what happens to the drug when it goes in your body?
[03:49:05.886 --> 03:49:06.667]  Where does it go?
[03:49:06.667 --> 03:49:07.648]  Where does it concentrate?
[03:49:07.648 --> 03:49:08.849]  How does your body break it down?
[03:49:09.509 --> 03:49:10.670]  How is it absorbed?
[03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:11.611]  How is it excreted?
[03:49:11.611 --> 03:49:12.492]  Through urine?
[03:49:12.492 --> 03:49:13.492]  Through feces?
[03:49:13.492 --> 03:49:14.693]  Through sweat?
[03:49:14.693 --> 03:49:28.084]  All that information is incredibly important and that's why it's not in there and she's showing you a blank piece of paper because they don't have the information or they have it and they're not sharing it because it's bad.
[03:49:28.084 --> 03:49:28.765]  Prove me wrong.
[03:49:30.166 --> 03:49:31.707]  Owen Schroer is coming up next.
[03:49:31.707 --> 03:49:33.709]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much for your time.
[03:49:33.709 --> 03:49:34.089]  Go ahead.
[03:49:34.089 --> 03:49:35.030]  What were you going to say?
[03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:37.992]  I just wanted to answer your second question.
[03:49:37.992 --> 03:49:39.853]  I do believe they will be approved.
[03:49:39.853 --> 03:49:46.018]  I'm incredibly frightened about that because the corruption is not going to end, Stu.
[03:49:46.018 --> 03:49:46.518]  Unbelievable.
[03:49:47.327 --> 03:49:48.729]  Dr. Jane Ruby, thank you so much.
[03:49:48.729 --> 03:49:51.752]  You can email her, by the way, anytime if you want to blow the whistle on some of this stuff.
[03:49:51.752 --> 03:49:53.574]  DrJaneRuby at ProtonMail.com.
[03:49:53.574 --> 03:49:56.116]  You can also find her at DrJaneRuby.com.
[03:49:56.116 --> 03:49:56.737]  Thank you so much.
[03:49:56.737 --> 03:49:58.839]  Owen Troyer is coming up next with The War Room.
[03:49:58.839 --> 03:50:01.262]  I've heard that it's going to be an incredibly exciting show.
[03:50:01.262 --> 03:50:04.745]  Please find me over at StuPeters.TV.
[03:50:04.745 --> 03:50:06.467]  Check out that story that we did today.
[03:50:06.467 --> 03:50:09.831]  This is absolutely unbelievable, aside from all the medical tyranny.
[03:50:10.934 --> 03:50:31.104]  Aside from Republican candidates in Florida threatening a hit squad, assassinations, assassins from Russia and Ukraine to go take out a political opponent, aside from all that, we now have voters, constituents, politely reaching out, asking for somebody to consider a forensic audit of the 2020 election.
[03:50:31.104 --> 03:50:32.885]  I don't know why they might be doing that.
[03:50:32.885 --> 03:50:34.666]  There was no questions there, was there?
[03:50:34.666 --> 03:50:36.287]  Simply asking, could we please
[03:50:36.988 --> 03:50:37.689]  Investigate this.
[03:50:37.689 --> 03:50:40.172]  Could we have a forensic audit of the vote here in the state of Minnesota?
[03:50:40.172 --> 03:50:44.198]  We want to make sure that these elections are full of integrity and transparent.
[03:50:44.198 --> 03:50:45.901]  Instead, she got threatened.
[03:50:45.901 --> 03:50:47.223]  That whole story is at StuPeters.tv.
[03:50:47.223 --> 03:50:50.688]  I hope to see you guys again next Friday right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:50.688 --> 03:50:51.229]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:52.271]  Owen Schroer is up next.
