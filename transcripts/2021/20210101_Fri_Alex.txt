[00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:22.740]  Wow, when I started out 27 years ago, right here in Austin, Texas, I just couldn't even imagine we'd be here.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.542]  January 1st, the year is 2020.
[00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:28.322]  It was 2020.
[00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:31.663]  Now it's 2021.
[00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:33.344]  January 1st, 2021.
[00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:36.825]  Not 2020.
[00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:42.948]  2020 was a hellish year, and I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, if I was you, I would get yourselves strapped in because I think
[00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:47.053]  2021 is going to get even crazier.
[00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:51.495]  It's the old Chinese proverb, may you live in interesting times.
[00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:56.317]  It is Friday, January 1st, 2021.
[00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:01.019]  And I want to open the phones up in the first hour.
[00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.022]  The head of Roger Stone with Major Exclusive Information joining us and Robert Barnes with Major Exclusive Information.
[00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.683]  He's been working since the election.
[00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:15.315]  For President Trump, going all across the country.
[00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:19.897]  He was there in Georgia with us and other areas, but he was off the radar then.
[00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:37.645]  And he can really give you the serious path to victory that Trump still has, but it is a narrowing window like an Indiana Jones, Raiders of the Lost Ark, where he rolls under as the wall lowers down and closes, and reaches through and grabs his whip right as it slams shut.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.923]  It's like a Robin Hood shot now of firing the arrow and splitting the arrow.
[00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:51.005]  And I've actually done that quite a few times, even 50 yards, split arrows.
[00:01:51.005 --> 00:02:00.030]  It can be done if you just relax, don't think about it, and loose the arrow very smoothly, you can hit the last arrow that is sticking in the bullseye.
[00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:06.877]  Of course, with composite arrows, they don't tend to split them, but back in the old days with the wooden arrows, I've done it quite a few times.
[00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:21.931]  So, the Death Star shot can be achieved, but it takes public pressure, it takes prayer, it takes precision, it takes providence, and it's happening.
[00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.735]  At least 140 House Republicans plan to object to Biden electoral votes.
[00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.400]  They're pressuring Josh Hawley to not contest.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.762]  Pence has asked the judge to toss out Louie Gohmert's lawsuit, seeking to overturn fraudulent election results.
[00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:41.922]  We have as much watch video.
[00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:50.764]  Jovan Pulitzer, the top Stanford research scientist, reveals electronic voting machines in Georgia communicating with vendor in China.
[00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:56.045]  The legislature ordered the ballots to be saved
[00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:10.759]  But then they have video of dump trucks there loading them and taking them to the landfill desperately like drug addicts or drug dealers flushing cocaine down a toilet when the police raid a crack house.
[00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.662]  I mean, this is not just open and shut.
[00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:21.866]  This is classical guys running out of the bank with bags of money in their hands when the cops pull up with a SWAT team.
[00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:23.347]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:03:23.347 --> 00:03:26.429]  But you've got total media blackout, mainstream media blackout.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:40.830]  You've got the real universe over here with InfoWars.com and Gateway Pundit and a few others, but even Newsmax and the rest of them are going along the line now that it is Joe Biden and the Joe Bidens who we're going to now have for the next four years.
[00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.191]  What a nightmare scenario.
[00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.695]  So it is Friday, January 1st, 2021.
[00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:48.096]  Hard to believe.
[00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.237]  What an incredible time.
[00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:55.802]  They're coming with forced inoculations of recombinant DNA that mutagenically manipulates your cells.
[00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:01.856]  In it is jellyfish genomes, dead human genomes, and other nightmare ingredients.
[00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:05.057]  Just, you can't make that up.
[00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:15.083]  Couldn't imagine, say, in 1996, when I was on air, saying in the year 2021, we'll have a world government, the UN's in charge, we're all wearing masks.
[00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:20.265]  And they're coming with inoculations to be able to buy and sell.
[00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:24.788]  And things are completely empty in New York and in
[00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:41.459]  LA but in Wuhan they are open for a big gigantic party celebrating the end of America and say that we will never reopen because we are cowards like chicken little they call us they call us the scared little chicken in China.
[00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.820]  Yeah, they know that story.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.823]  And they did such a good job with Bill Gates and the media.
[00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:48.805]  Such a good job destroying America.
[00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:51.747]  At least they think so.
[00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:53.569]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.709]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:55.330]  The year is 2021.
[00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.350]  2021. 2021.
[00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:03.776]  Fight for Trump on January 6th in Washington D.C.
[00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:10.601]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.122]  It's 1776 time!
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.006]  On November 14th, hundreds of thousands of American patriots gathered in the nation's capital to stop the biggest election steal in American history.
[00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:25.988]  America is going under and up this martial law!
[00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:35.734]  And if a communist Chinese agent, Joe Biden, is able to get in there, he will put America under permanent lockdown, siege, until we're brought to our knees!
[00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:36.615]  Tell it!
[00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.156]  Hundreds of thousands return to D.C.
[00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:39.937]  in December.
[00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:41.258]  We will never give up.
[00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.278]  We will never surrender.
[00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:47.802]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist New World Order.
[00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:49.242]  January 6th.
[00:05:49.242 --> 00:05:50.103]  Fight for Trump.
[00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:50.323]  D.C.
[00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:51.944]  Be there.
[00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:53.085]  We will never give in.
[00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:54.205]  We will never give up.
[00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:55.886]  And we will never back down.
[00:05:55.886 --> 00:05:58.348]  We will never, ever surrender.
[00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:20.918]  It's Friday, January 1st.
[00:06:20.918 --> 00:06:25.542]  The first day of the new year 2021.
[00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:27.984]  It really is hard to believe.
[00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:39.527]  The 2020, this insane year, is now in the past, and we're pulling away rapidly into the future of the space-time continuum.
[00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:43.912]  It is now Friday, January 1st, 2021, and I intend to open the phones up
[00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:58.236]  Throughout the broadcast today, Roger Stone's got a lot of big intel and breaking news and information joining us in the second hour exclusively.
[00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:08.661]  Then Robert Barnes, who has been a lawyer quietly working for President Trump on the election fraud, will be joining us with the cold hard facts in the third hour today.
[00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:28.023]  And then in the fourth hour, we've got Dale Bigtree and the admitted science and the admitted documentation that these vaccines are tied to actually making you have a bigger autoimmune response to other COVID-19 viruses or regular coronaviruses and infertility.
[00:07:28.023 --> 00:07:33.767]  Now you've already heard that from top scientists and top researchers, but now it's happening.
[00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:39.551]  And so this is such a bold and insane power grab
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.023]  By the globalists you have to ask, how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:51.045]  If you understand psychology, I call it too evil to fail.
[00:07:54.278 --> 00:08:20.329]  When they engage in something this massive, something this big, something this criminal, and they get the general public, and millions of doctors, and nurses, and healthcare practitioners, and drug reps, and media operatives, and mothers, and fathers, and brothers, and sisters, and aunts, and uncles, and pastors, and school administrators, and counselors to go along
[00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:49.148]  With telling people to take the vaccine, the social engineers have noticed that most people, when they're part of a crime, when they're part of something corrupt, when they get manipulated into doing something wrong, they don't say they're wrong, they decide to get even more delusional and to sign on to even more excesses and more extremes.
[00:08:51.325 --> 00:08:58.391]  And there's many examples of this that you could point out throughout history, but it's a well-known phenomenon.
[00:08:58.391 --> 00:09:11.201]  And the one that I've personally experienced with co-workers and even not distant family, but not really close family, I'm very embarrassed about it, is online scams.
[00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:13.763]  Everybody knows about Nigerian email scams.
[00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:19.468]  They're one of the most popular, one of the most prolific, but there's lots of, lots of groups doing it.
[00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:20.789]  And you get an email that, hey,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:29.541]  The royal bloodline of Prince Abubu wants to give you $1,000.
[00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:35.982]  He's got money locked up, millions in his bank account, but he is unable because of sanctions to get it out or whatever.
[00:09:35.982 --> 00:09:40.223]  If you'll just give him $1,000, you will be given $20,000.
[00:09:40.223 --> 00:09:51.165]  And when you give him the thousand, they go, well, he's ready to give you even more money, but he needs 5,000 more, but now he's going to give you a half million.
[00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:57.798]  And usually most people, once they've given a thousand, they don't want to admit they got conned.
[00:09:57.798 --> 00:09:59.964]  They give the larger amount.
[00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:09.745]  And then, if you've already given them like $20,000, $30,000, a Cadillac will pull up at your house, because they've got, you know, some of the guys of the scam all over the country.
[00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:13.307]  They'll be in royal robes and say, I am the representative of Prince Abubu.
[00:10:13.307 --> 00:10:14.568]  He thanks you graciously.
[00:10:14.568 --> 00:10:16.189]  Let's make a phone call to him.
[00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:18.171]  And he will graciously thank you from Nigeria.
[00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:24.995]  And then some people will mortgage their house to give $100,000 to Prince Abubu, because now Prince Abubu is going to give you $50 million.
[00:10:30.202 --> 00:10:36.065]  And again, I knew a guy, a GCN talk show host that said, I'm being offered $100,000 by Nigerians.
[00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:37.286]  I've already given him $5,000.
[00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:40.647]  And I called the guy and I said, that's a scam, bro.
[00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:41.388]  Are you joking?
[00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:44.109]  Or are you part of this?
[00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:45.230]  And he said, screw you.
[00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.030]  You're just jealous.
[00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.011]  I'm going to get all this money.
[00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:51.813]  And then he actually got ripped off.
[00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:53.754]  That's a radio host.
[00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:56.676]  And then had a nervous breakdown.
[00:10:56.676 --> 00:10:56.856]  So,
[00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:01.845]  But again, people want something that's too good to be true.
[00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:05.585]  That's why lottery tickets are so successful.
[00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:11.946]  If you wanna buy lottery tickets, go ahead and do it, but it's designed to sell you false hope.
[00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:19.268]  And you statistically will get struck by lightning before you're gonna win a major lottery ticket.
[00:11:19.268 --> 00:11:25.949]  But I have found when people get conned, most of the time they get mad at you
[00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:33.113]  And they don't want you to tell them they're being conned.
[00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:40.739]  They think you're acting uppity and are trying to impress them or trying to put them down.
[00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:43.981]  That's the same thing with these vaccines.
[00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:45.262]  I know exactly why they did all this.
[00:11:45.262 --> 00:11:46.403]  They had this plan for a long time.
[00:11:46.403 --> 00:11:51.127]  They launched a little bit early because they were worried about Trump and nationalism and all the rest of it.
[00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.410]  But the vaccine's got its own mission, but it's part of a larger operation.
[00:11:56.095 --> 00:12:09.026]  In December of last year, excuse me, now of 2019, so in December of 2019, so 13 months ago, excuse me, we're already in 2021, that takes getting used to.
[00:12:09.026 --> 00:12:10.687]  You saw us play the clubs here.
[00:12:10.687 --> 00:12:19.275]  They had a UN summit in Switzerland with the head of the WHO and all the vaccine experts, a two-day summit, put it out, gave it no attention though.
[00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:20.436]  We learned about it for a couple weeks.
[00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:25.956]  But so on record, they said we should halt the World Vaccine Program.
[00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:27.177]  The doctors don't trust us.
[00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:28.417]  It's killing people.
[00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:29.238]  It's not tested.
[00:12:29.238 --> 00:12:30.778]  Big Pharma tells us what to do.
[00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:33.520]  We're not comfortable doing this.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.062]  Already at that point, they'd released COVID-19 out of Wuhan.
[00:12:38.062 --> 00:12:40.003]  They were already planning the big hysteria.
[00:12:40.003 --> 00:12:41.463]  They were already planning the big global U.N.
[00:12:41.463 --> 00:12:43.444]  rollout.
[00:12:43.444 --> 00:12:44.405]  Failing forward.
[00:12:44.405 --> 00:12:45.345]  Too big to fail.
[00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.206]  Too evil to fail.
[00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:52.298]  So that now we're not talking about the 50 million it's estimated autistic boys in the world from vaccines.
[00:12:52.298 --> 00:12:57.107]  All industrialized countries where they take the vaccines doesn't even exist in non-industrial areas.
[00:12:57.107 --> 00:12:58.230]  Doesn't exist in the Amish.
[00:13:01.593 --> 00:13:08.755]  And the tens of millions every year that get cancer from vaccines and all the other problems, that all gets washed away by the COVID hysteria.
[00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:11.075]  And, oh yeah, there's some adverse reactions, don't worry about it.
[00:13:11.075 --> 00:13:29.500]  And then they just swamp the media with, yeah, this person died, that person died, yeah, somebody got paralyzed, big deal, move on, until it just becomes background noise while they silence all the anti-vaxxers, while they silence all the medical doctors and scientists and mothers and activists and, you know, the
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.181]  Big Pharma whistleblower.
[00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:33.022]  She ends up at 47.
[00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:35.383]  That's my age.
[00:13:35.383 --> 00:13:37.945]  Dead in her house.
[00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:46.290]  We've got the documents out of Australia where the government was talking to Big Pharma heads and they were talking about killing anti-vaxxers, as they call us.
[00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.751]  We're not anti-vaxxers.
[00:13:47.751 --> 00:14:00.079]  We're anti-megacorporations with globalist depopulation agendas, with a long history of secret testing and tainting things, wanting to put in us a whole new generation of systems that mutate ourselves on record.
[00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:04.872]  Now there's the headline of the Washington Post.
[00:14:04.872 --> 00:14:07.234]  Anti-vaxxers are dangerous.
[00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:08.975]  Make them face isolation.
[00:14:08.975 --> 00:14:10.576]  Fines and arrest.
[00:14:10.576 --> 00:14:11.177]  Print that for me.
[00:14:11.177 --> 00:14:13.458]  Did you hear that?
[00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:15.340]  Make them face isolation.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.081]  Fines and arrest.
[00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.803]  You don't like getting Guillain-Barré's?
[00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:21.844]  You don't like getting Bell's palsy?
[00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:23.926]  You don't like getting type 1 diabetes?
[00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:25.367]  You don't like getting cancer?
[00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:26.667]  You don't like dying?
[00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.409]  You don't like having convulsions?
[00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.870]  You don't like getting sterilized?
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.448]  You don't like becoming totally allergic to every coronavirus out there?
[00:14:37.448 --> 00:14:39.110]  Is what most experts say this is going to do?
[00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:50.009]  What are they going to do when fabulous numbers of people are dying from the common cold from an autoimmune response just like the 1917 flu with an influenza virus?
[00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:51.130]  It's the same thing.
[00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.351]  They're going to call it COVID-20, 21, 22, 23.
[00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:57.313]  That's the plan.
[00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:05.137]  And that's why virologists and top scientists have said this is going to actually trigger people to die.
[00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:09.440]  And even the FDA says, well, it might make COVID worse when you take the vaccine.
[00:15:10.503 --> 00:15:14.067]  Will you come into contact with the COVID again?
[00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:30.064]  Just what Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the EU Advisory Commission, and the former head of Pfizer, wrote that lawsuit on December 1st, and filed it in the EU as an injunction against this damn vaccine, and they didn't block it.
[00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:39.988]  And they say, right there, top scientists tell us this will probably cause an autoimmune response, like the 1917 flu, and kill people, not from the virus, but the autoimmune response.
[00:15:39.988 --> 00:15:43.791]  You're gonna give people an allergic response to the common flu, and the common cold.
[00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:45.832]  What the hell are you doing?
[00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:46.973]  Well, we know what they're doing.
[00:15:46.973 --> 00:15:48.654]  They're coming to kill us!
[00:15:48.654 --> 00:15:50.216]  And that's the facts!
[00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:51.216]  Too evil to fail!
[00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:53.218]  That's the plan!
[00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:54.159]  My God!
[00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:58.222]  The Antichrist World Government System is here!
[00:15:58.222 --> 00:15:59.323]  TheResistance.Video

[00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:17.905]  Ban.video.
[00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:21.406]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[00:16:21.406 --> 00:16:26.408]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:31.351]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:36.014]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[00:16:36.014 --> 00:16:37.935]  TheResistance.Video.
[00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:42.398]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[00:16:42.398 --> 00:16:53.025]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries, and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:53.926]  Share the link.

[00:16:55.527 --> 00:16:56.528]  TheResistance.Video.
[00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:01.334]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:17:01.334 --> 00:17:05.659]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:14.191]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:31.138]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[00:17:31.138 --> 00:17:42.163]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:51.148]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:17:51.148 --> 00:18:01.274]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:01.274 --> 00:18:03.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:26.702 --> 00:18:37.953]  We are now live in the year 2021.
[00:18:37.953 --> 00:18:46.022]  I want to give the number out and I want to take your phone call specifically on what do you think we should do in the year 2021 to take back our liberties.
[00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:50.219]  I say we stop complying with the mask mandates.
[00:18:50.219 --> 00:18:56.404]  We start filing lawsuits on businesses and companies that try to make their employees wear them.
[00:18:56.404 --> 00:19:04.130]  I say everybody should be filing lawsuits and doing boycotts of companies that try to make their employees take these toxic inoculations.
[00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.834]  We should call for Congress to strip the vaccine liability protection laws of 1986.
[00:19:10.916 --> 00:19:13.980]  out and make these companies be liable.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:22.892]  I think we should strip Section 230 that Trump's trying to do out of big tech so that they can't operate as these monopoly combines.
[00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:25.636]  There's so much we need to discuss what needs to be done.
[00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:33.790]  And I think in the year 2021, Trump needs to level the American people that he thought this was a regular vaccine.
[00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:40.654]  And he thought that he was trying to get the economy going again, and didn't understand that this was designed to never allow the economy to operate.
[00:19:40.654 --> 00:19:44.277]  And they now admit that the vaccine, quote, won't even protect you from COVID.
[00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:45.758]  It'll actually make you get sicker.
[00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:54.984]  That's such an incredible fine print admission that Trump needs to get this millstone that he tied around our neck and his neck off of us.
[00:19:54.984 --> 00:19:56.025]  And he needs to reverse
[00:19:57.225 --> 00:20:04.128]  The biggest single failure is going along with this whole vaccine situation.
[00:20:04.128 --> 00:20:21.975]  And Trump also needs to admit that he didn't do enough to go after the massive systemic censorship and racketeering cartel activities of big tech working together as a combine, as a oligopoly to suppress competition.
[00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:24.196]  That is absolutely illegal and is beyond
[00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:31.115]  Just running major trust operations, major monopoly operations.
[00:20:31.115 --> 00:20:32.416]  But what else needs to be done?
[00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:35.540]  What is your declaration of independence in the year 2021?
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:35.700]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:35.780]  Alex?
[00:20:46.772 --> 00:20:55.659]  First-time callers, long-time callers, and I will put nurses or doctors that call in at the headline, just tell us, 877-789-2539.
[00:20:55.659 --> 00:21:04.487]  I got a lot of footage of cops now being arrested for slamming men and women down who aren't wearing masks in public.
[00:21:04.487 --> 00:21:05.948]  Good, arrest them, that's assault.
[00:21:07.108 --> 00:21:13.150]  We've got footage of police following people home that aren't wearing their mask, a lot of sickening virtue signaling.
[00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:27.153]  We need to put major pressure on the police to follow the Constitutional Bill of Rights and point out that the very same leftists pushing this hoax are the ones that want to take control of the police and put them under the United Nations.
[00:21:27.153 --> 00:21:36.336]  So I'm pro-police when they're pro-law and order and pro-Constitution, but when they become globalist minders and violate that oath, they become enemies of the Republic.
[00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:55.661]  That doesn't mean we shoot them in the head like Black Lives Matter or Antifa, but we shoot them with truth and information and education and reality and we put pressure on their bosses and pressure on the legislatures to make sure that they understand the big picture.
[00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:57.123]  Because the police just want to comply.
[00:21:58.968 --> 00:22:08.753]  That's why you look at black neighborhoods, the crime rates have exploded because the cops won't go in there now in the poor black neighborhoods because they don't want to make a mistake and get arrested or put in prison.
[00:22:08.753 --> 00:22:09.353]  It's the same thing.
[00:22:09.353 --> 00:22:16.577]  Cops go, Oh, I can, I'm supposed to tackle somebody isn't wearing a mask at the mall, but a Black Lives Matter comes in here and knocks out windows.
[00:22:16.577 --> 00:22:17.538]  I'm not supposed to arrest them.
[00:22:19.329 --> 00:22:23.813]  That's showing you how the police are political creatures like anything else.
[00:22:23.813 --> 00:22:28.036]  And we need to stand up and not just blindly support the police.
[00:22:28.036 --> 00:22:32.520]  We need to support the police when they support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.082]  So that's another big issue we need to be breaking down at 877-789-2539.
[00:22:41.206 --> 00:22:47.855]  But of course they had a fake study that, oh, when Black Lives Matter marched by the millions, they didn't contribute to COVID, they actually made it better.
[00:22:47.855 --> 00:22:50.117]  But when you have a church service, it's bad.
[00:22:50.117 --> 00:22:56.385]  This is the type of ridiculous gaslighting the system puts in our faces.
[00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:58.949]  Now again, Roger Stone's going to join us talking about
[00:23:00.196 --> 00:23:15.946]  The big rallies coming up the 5th and 6th, what he thinks Trump's strategy should be to win, how big it is this date on the 6th, when we do have over 140 House members and senators that are going to try to block the seating of these delegates from five states.
[00:23:15.946 --> 00:23:19.228]  This is going to go into an incredible constitutional crisis.
[00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:24.211]  And to lay that out, we then have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes joining us.
[00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:32.478]  In the third hour, then Dale Bigtree popping in on the deadly vaccines and the rally they've got coming up on the 6th of D.C.
[00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:34.658]  as well, and then Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:23:34.658 --> 00:23:42.620]  So, quite a transmission lined up for you on the first broadcast of 2021.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.081]  January 1st, 2021, we are here.
[00:23:45.081 --> 00:23:52.883]  When we come back, I'm gonna go right to your phone calls, and then I'm gonna get into this in the final segment.
[00:23:54.124 --> 00:24:00.730]  Wuhan locals pack the streets to celebrate New Year's as the rest of the world suffers under COVID lockdowns.
[00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.733]  All they do is set the PCR test to say there's no COVID.
[00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:05.895]  They now say China is COVID-free.
[00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:07.437]  Who believes that?
[00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:10.600]  Absolute, total, communist crap.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.242]  They can turn their economy on.
[00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:13.803]  They can turn their economy off.
[00:24:13.803 --> 00:24:15.865]  They can make up whatever statistics they want.
[00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:16.486]  That's why
[00:24:19.065 --> 00:24:26.308]  The Canadian Prime Minister said he admires Communist China's dictatorship and wants that for Canada.
[00:24:26.308 --> 00:24:33.230]  2021 is the year when humanity must go on the offensive against globalism.
[00:24:34.503 --> 00:24:39.205]  March 21 is the year when humanity must go on offense against globalism.
[00:24:39.205 --> 00:24:43.206]  Live New Year's show is live at man.videoandinfowars.com.
[00:24:43.206 --> 00:24:52.889]  I hope you take that page and email it and text message it and word of mouth it and Facebook it and Parler it and Twitter it and Telegram it because that's how we reach new people.
[00:24:52.889 --> 00:24:54.309]  That's how we stay on air.
[00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.370]  That's how we override the globalists.
[00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.071]  And I can't tell you how many people.
[00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:01.792]  I was on with Tim Dillon last night for an hour.
[00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.673]  On his very popular podcast, Millions of Viewers.
[00:25:06.673 --> 00:25:12.478]  And he had a guest host who was listening to me 10, 15 years ago.
[00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:18.083]  And he said, but when you got deplatformed, I thought you were off air and didn't know you were on air.
[00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.465]  How many callers yesterday?
[00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:22.327]  Three callers brought that up on air yesterday.
[00:25:22.327 --> 00:25:26.711]  They said, Alex, when you got deplatformed three years ago, I thought you were off the air.
[00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:27.672]  Think of that mind control.
[00:25:29.198 --> 00:25:30.379]  A Jedi mind trick.
[00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:31.941]  Alex Jones is off the air now.
[00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:33.603]  Alex Jones has failed.
[00:25:33.603 --> 00:25:35.084]  Alex Jones lost a lawsuit.
[00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:36.506]  None of that was even true.
[00:25:36.506 --> 00:25:38.708]  Alex Jones is gone.
[00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:44.814]  And there we are on hundreds of radio stations and TV stations and a huge audience at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:50.275]  That now is many times bigger than it ever was.
[00:25:50.275 --> 00:25:56.782]  Our hardcore audience at Band.Video and InfoWars.com is 3, 4, 5 times, depending on the day, what it was then.
[00:25:56.782 --> 00:26:02.969]  Before we were distributed out there, huge on Facebook, huge on Twitter, huge on YouTube.
[00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:04.691]  But then they crossed us down to here.
[00:26:06.035 --> 00:26:10.057]  Like, you know, sending us off to be in exile.
[00:26:10.057 --> 00:26:13.159]  And that, which doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger because of you.
[00:26:13.159 --> 00:26:18.022]  You are the resistance, you are the info war, and you absolutely blow them away.
[00:26:18.022 --> 00:26:23.265]  And so you're the hardcore audience that knows we're on air and knows we should have URLs, we should have our own websites.
[00:26:23.265 --> 00:26:28.729]  The answer to all this censorship and all this centralization, all this control, is to build our own systems.
[00:26:29.807 --> 00:26:33.408]  We've got our other social media networks and things like that, like Pollard, that are exploding.
[00:26:33.408 --> 00:26:34.008]  That's great.
[00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:43.971]  But you need media production houses with researchers and journalists and camera crews and analysts and legal advice to be able to put on a resistance to the globalists.
[00:26:43.971 --> 00:26:47.192]  And that's why the brain trust that is InfoWars is so precious.
[00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:51.534]  And thank you from the bottom of my heart for keeping us on the air into the year 2021.
[00:26:51.534 --> 00:26:54.995]  This is the house you built, and I thank you and salute you.
[00:26:56.678 --> 00:27:02.919]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:09.901]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:13.361]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[00:27:13.361 --> 00:27:18.422]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[00:27:18.422 --> 00:27:22.703]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:33.705]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:37.827]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[00:27:37.827 --> 00:27:44.311]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:49.854]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[00:27:49.854 --> 00:27:50.755]  So help me God.
[00:27:51.275 --> 00:27:52.958]  Infowars.com.
[00:27:52.958 --> 00:27:53.879]  Banned dot video.
[00:27:56.142 --> 00:28:00.383]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming.
[00:28:00.383 --> 00:28:03.985]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:09.246]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:16.068]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices, and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:19.509]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:21.790]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.231]  The globalists are waging siege against us.
[00:28:24.671 --> 00:28:29.595]  Trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[00:28:29.595 --> 00:28:34.259]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:45.528]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at preparewithalex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storable foods out there.
[00:28:45.968 --> 00:28:56.116]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at preparewithalex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality, storable food.
[00:28:56.116 --> 00:28:59.078]  It's back in stock.
[00:28:59.078 --> 00:29:00.560]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.642]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:04.583]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[00:29:04.923 --> 00:29:09.046]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[00:29:09.046 --> 00:29:15.029]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:16.170]  It's amazing.
[00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.651]  Folks absolutely love it.
[00:29:17.651 --> 00:29:20.593]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[00:29:20.593 --> 00:29:23.455]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[00:29:23.455 --> 00:29:25.396]  25% off at infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.277]  Pollen block again.
[00:29:27.097 --> 00:29:29.158]  It's available in this one-minute ad.
[00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:40.221]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[00:29:40.221 --> 00:29:41.822]  This is naturally occurring.
[00:29:41.822 --> 00:29:48.644]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress, and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[00:29:48.644 --> 00:29:49.664]  You chew up the pills.
[00:29:49.664 --> 00:29:50.424]  They taste great.
[00:29:50.424 --> 00:29:51.505]  It's available again.
[00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:52.485]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:07.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:08.179]  Rally Patriots Worldwide!
[00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:25.382]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:30:25.382 --> 00:30:29.183]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:29.183 --> 00:30:32.084]  Rising up, my friends, not laying down.
[00:30:32.084 --> 00:30:34.765]  You get stronger when you fight back, not weaker.
[00:30:34.765 --> 00:30:38.966]  It's the animated contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:51.735]  I could have chosen to be a victim under all the lawsuits, the lies, the physical attacks, the censorship, the demonization, but instead I took the bull by the horns.
[00:30:51.735 --> 00:30:55.276]  You steadfastly did the same thing and we're here stronger than ever.
[00:30:55.276 --> 00:30:56.337]  God bless you all.
[00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:58.918]  Okay.
[00:30:58.918 --> 00:31:07.903]  We're going to go to Dennis and Greg and Jason and Tim and Adam and Chase and John and Michael and Brian, everybody else.
[00:31:07.903 --> 00:31:10.104]  Here in just about 30 seconds, but I want to say this one more time.
[00:31:11.343 --> 00:31:20.306]  You turn on any television set, you turn on any radio, you hear, take your vaccine, it's wonderful, it's perfect, it never hurts anybody, do it, do it, do it.
[00:31:20.306 --> 00:31:26.247]  This is a giant globalist takeover to set the precedent to put in our bodies what they want, when they want.
[00:31:26.247 --> 00:31:28.228]  This is the whole world government agenda.
[00:31:28.228 --> 00:31:29.228]  This is the mark of the beast.
[00:31:29.228 --> 00:31:30.849]  This is the tracking system.
[00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.469]  This is it.
[00:31:32.469 --> 00:31:37.651]  And yes, Trump has failed at this critical juncture on this critical issue.
[00:31:37.651 --> 00:31:38.651]  He has gone along with it.
[00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:46.353]  And I thought he was doing that to take control of the agenda from him to get things unlocked, which partially they've done.
[00:31:46.353 --> 00:31:47.954]  And I understand that Trump's not a scientist.
[00:31:47.954 --> 00:31:48.995]  It doesn't matter.
[00:31:48.995 --> 00:31:50.035]  Trump won the election.
[00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:51.396]  The Democrats are trying to steal it.
[00:31:51.396 --> 00:31:55.178]  They want him out of the way because Joe Biden is 500 times worse.
[00:31:55.178 --> 00:31:56.918]  So I support Trump.
[00:31:56.918 --> 00:32:03.402]  The Bidens are literal mentally ill demons who can't even, you know, get a confetti popper to go.
[00:32:03.402 --> 00:32:05.242]  They're perfect puppets.
[00:32:05.242 --> 00:32:05.843]  That's coming up.
[00:32:06.772 --> 00:32:12.721]  But we need to put pressure on Trump with 19 days left in office to wake the hell up about these vaccines.
[00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:14.884]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[00:32:14.884 --> 00:32:16.426]  Let's talk to Jason in Oregon.
[00:32:16.426 --> 00:32:18.128]  What are you planning to do?
[00:32:18.128 --> 00:32:19.871]  Or what do you think's coming in 2021?
[00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.614]  Because it's not coming, it's here.
[00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:25.188]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:32:25.188 --> 00:32:26.449]  So good to be on with you again.
[00:32:26.449 --> 00:32:38.014]  Just want to let you know, I used to call in as Jason from Germany, but I had to get my family out of Germany, brought them back to the States after Trump was re-elected because... I remember, you've been calling for what, four or five years?
[00:32:38.014 --> 00:32:38.375]  Yes, sir.
[00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:43.677]  I've been listening longer than that, but I had to get my family out because of the invasion, which you're well aware of.
[00:32:43.677 --> 00:32:44.638]  The Islamic invasion.
[00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.791]  Yes, sir.
[00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:52.015]  Brought my family here, back to my home state of Oregon, which I love and wanted to put down roots in.
[00:32:52.015 --> 00:32:53.777]  Unfortunately, as you know, it didn't work out here.
[00:32:53.777 --> 00:33:04.846]  The West Coast appears to have become aligned with Chinese interests more than anything else, with the shutdowns here acting as an economic block to destroy people's lives.
[00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:06.007]  Oh, China brags!
[00:33:06.007 --> 00:33:08.789]  They say, invest here, we control the upper circles of the U.S.
[00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:09.730]  They will never reopen.
[00:33:10.447 --> 00:33:11.028]  Never.
[00:33:11.028 --> 00:33:11.668]  They said we will never.
[00:33:11.668 --> 00:33:12.829]  And they laugh.
[00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:17.734]  And they're out, not wearing masks, partying, totally open, laughing at us.
[00:33:17.734 --> 00:33:18.615]  That's right.
[00:33:18.615 --> 00:33:20.196]  So anyway, we're moving out to Texas, man.
[00:33:20.196 --> 00:33:22.819]  Maybe one of these days we'll actually get to see each other.
[00:33:22.819 --> 00:33:26.122]  But I look at Texas as kind of the last stand for freedom lovers.
[00:33:27.162 --> 00:33:33.767]  You know, I agree, because Tucker Carlson had the governor on a few days ago, and a lot of people are dumb that are moving here, don't know why.
[00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:35.649]  They just know they're running for themselves.
[00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:42.154]  But I'd say more than half the people coming are running from the communism, from the socialism, from the globalism, from the Islamification.
[00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:46.258]  And so Texas isn't perfect, but it is shaping up to kind of be the last stand in the future.
[00:33:47.517 --> 00:34:02.643]  Well, I think it's time for people, patriots and freedom lovers, to start building their own systems, as we've talked about before on your show, building community, building co-ops with each other, creating separate systems that cannot be controlled.
[00:34:02.643 --> 00:34:03.283]  I agree.
[00:34:03.283 --> 00:34:12.787]  In the future, we need to build communities, media organizations, medical systems, legal systems that are separate from the Babylonian world government satanic order.
[00:34:12.787 --> 00:34:13.988]  Thank you so much.
[00:34:13.988 --> 00:34:14.548]  You know, I was
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:35.571]  Looking at one of the video thumbnails on Bandot Video, I forget the exact headline, guys go to Bandot Video, and it's of an ancient European drawing of the devil from the Dark Ages, for the Middle Ages, eating a baby.
[00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:35.911]  There it is.
[00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:50.792]  Now you can go back 3,000 years and see paintings of the devil in China, in Greece, in Egypt, and then later into the Roman Empire and then into Christendom, and it's always the same.
[00:34:50.792 --> 00:34:52.154]  A horned god eating babies.
[00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.599]  No, that's just back in the past.
[00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:56.520]  No.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:02.781]  The whole system is about aborting babies, killing babies, killing our genetics, killing the fruit of us, killing our future.
[00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:04.141]  Children are the symbol of the future.
[00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:05.562]  The devil wants to destroy your future.
[00:35:05.562 --> 00:35:08.042]  So let's put that back on screen.
[00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:15.144]  We're facing the same spirit that we were facing back then.
[00:35:15.144 --> 00:35:21.025]  And in every ancient drawing of the devil, it's eating children and or drinking their blood and tearing them limb from limb.
[00:35:22.202 --> 00:35:23.223]  Okay.
[00:35:23.223 --> 00:35:24.424]  So that's its goal.
[00:35:24.424 --> 00:35:25.725]  What's the goal here?
[00:35:25.725 --> 00:35:29.588]  Total destruction.
[00:35:29.588 --> 00:35:31.550]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Adam in Florida.
[00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.432]  Adam, thank you for holding.
[00:35:33.432 --> 00:35:34.913]  Alex, thanks for letting me call back.
[00:35:34.913 --> 00:35:37.215]  The other day, I got, you cut me off.
[00:35:37.215 --> 00:35:41.578]  I was kind of being, you know, sarcastic, but serious about Hunter Biden.
[00:35:41.578 --> 00:35:43.760]  And he did have- No, no, I apologize.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.343]  I was in a really bad mood and just kind of snapped on you for no reason.
[00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:46.563]  Go ahead.
[00:35:47.509 --> 00:36:00.072]  Well, I want to give you some credit for, first off, I know it's a little off subject, but you would be one of the best preachers if you could just take like, maybe like, I don't know what day you do it on, but maybe once a week, once a month.
[00:36:00.072 --> 00:36:06.654]  But you were the person that got me through politics to finally accept Jesus as my Savior.
[00:36:06.654 --> 00:36:09.534]  And I'm not trying to say that to be silly, it's really true.
[00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:12.815]  It was first politics, but I did realize that
[00:36:13.726 --> 00:36:21.517]  It's about, you know, will we wrestle not with, against flesh and blood, against principalities, powers, you know, how it goes, you know, so.
[00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:24.137]  Well, brother, I mean, I'm just like you.
[00:36:24.137 --> 00:36:25.237]  We're all the same.
[00:36:25.237 --> 00:36:27.098]  And I have a connection to God, even though I'm a sinner.
[00:36:27.098 --> 00:36:28.439]  And I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:28.439 --> 00:36:29.920]  And people recognize that.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.840]  It's energetic.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.860]  It's spiritual.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.181]  You recognize it in me.
[00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:34.542]  I recognize it in you.
[00:36:34.542 --> 00:36:36.603]  And that is the congregation coming together.
[00:36:36.603 --> 00:36:40.705]  The problem is, you go to most of these churches, the Holy Spirit's not there.
[00:36:40.705 --> 00:36:44.746]  It's people wanting to come together, but there's a spirit over it, wanting to control it.
[00:36:46.127 --> 00:36:53.190]  Greatest toehold is these fake churches who aren't saying a word about the world government, the Mark of the Beast of Mind cell.
[00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.171]  They're bringing the QR codes in.
[00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.392]  They're doing the thermometer test.
[00:36:57.392 --> 00:36:58.992]  They're going along with it, most of them.
[00:36:58.992 --> 00:37:05.935]  But it's also real churches around the country like Rodney Howard Brown and others that are leading the fight against it.
[00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:07.676]  So the church is real.
[00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:09.617]  You just got to find a real one.
[00:37:09.617 --> 00:37:14.278]  Just think at the end of the day, you could win some souls, but that's not really why I called.
[00:37:14.278 --> 00:37:15.539]  I was, you know, Hunter Biden.
[00:37:16.092 --> 00:37:18.493]  He's going to have his art exhibition.
[00:37:18.493 --> 00:37:20.073]  You know, you heard that coming up.
[00:37:20.073 --> 00:37:23.754]  You got his rotten teeth fix, his Pornhub channel.
[00:37:23.754 --> 00:37:26.896]  And I wonder how that's just going to go away.
[00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:29.896]  If the media is really just going to keep ignoring it.
[00:37:29.896 --> 00:37:32.557]  You know, I couldn't imagine if it was... Well, that's what this is really all about.
[00:37:32.557 --> 00:37:36.959]  The New World Order offers corrupt people false salvation.
[00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:46.595]  And to act with impunity, commit whatever crimes, run sex rings, torture people, be a pedophile, be a traitor.
[00:37:46.595 --> 00:37:50.256]  That's what this is all about, is be in our club, and we will give you protection.
[00:37:50.256 --> 00:37:53.678]  But really, it just brings down the whole civilization.
[00:37:53.678 --> 00:38:01.261]  Think, like, back in 2008, when we went from Bush to Obama, there was like a crash, I remember, with the economy.
[00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:06.643]  I felt like maybe they crashed it down so Obama would have credit for building it back.
[00:38:07.344 --> 00:38:14.874]  I wonder if they're going to have this dark winter thing play out here between February, you know, because we don't have much winter left.
[00:38:14.874 --> 00:38:16.716]  Is it going to go February to March?
[00:38:16.716 --> 00:38:18.238]  Real hard times.
[00:38:18.238 --> 00:38:22.643]  Biden gets credit for building back from the bottom after they they burn it down.
[00:38:22.643 --> 00:38:23.324]  You know what I mean?
[00:38:23.324 --> 00:38:23.765]  I wonder.
[00:38:24.156 --> 00:38:33.858]  I think that's one of their plans, but they're going to announce they fixed it, while at the same time, once these people get you down and get their hands around your neck, they never want to let loose.
[00:38:33.858 --> 00:38:36.199]  The whole goal was always to make us poor.
[00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:38.240]  The whole goal was always to kill kids.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.960]  The whole goal was always to bring us to our knees.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.261]  So, do they ever take their boot off the Blue Cities?
[00:38:43.261 --> 00:38:43.301]  No.
[00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:46.062]  Do they ever take their boot off the third world?
[00:38:46.062 --> 00:38:46.663]  No.
[00:38:46.663 --> 00:38:48.203]  They ever take their boot off Africa?
[00:38:48.203 --> 00:38:49.084]  No.
[00:38:49.084 --> 00:38:51.265]  And so I don't think the boot's ever coming off.
[00:38:51.265 --> 00:38:52.466]  In fact, they've said that.
[00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:54.127]  They're all going to get more rich.
[00:38:54.127 --> 00:38:56.228]  They're all going to be more powerful.
[00:38:56.228 --> 00:38:59.010]  But for the general public, I think things are going to get far worse.
[00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.311]  Thank you for the call.
[00:39:01.311 --> 00:39:06.414]  We're going to go to break, come back with more calls, and I'll get into all of the vaccine news, all the election news.
[00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:08.676]  Roger Stone is coming up separately.
[00:39:08.676 --> 00:39:10.377]  We've got a lot of products that are now back in stock.
[00:39:10.377 --> 00:39:11.237]  Well, thank you for your support.
[00:39:11.237 --> 00:39:12.778]  Without you, we won't be here.
[00:39:12.778 --> 00:39:13.339]  Pollen Block.
[00:39:14.366 --> 00:39:19.379]  Is a natural anti-allergy, anti-seasonal discomfort from quail eggs.
[00:39:19.379 --> 00:39:21.905]  It's got this natural form of anti-
[00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:26.199]  Pollen type activation.
[00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:27.299]  And I love it.
[00:39:27.299 --> 00:39:28.359]  It works really well.
[00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:29.019]  They taste sweet.
[00:39:29.019 --> 00:39:30.180]  You chew them up in your mouth.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.200]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.540]  The supply chain's broke down.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.761]  Pollen Block is back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[00:39:35.761 --> 00:39:37.282]  And so is Living Defense.
[00:39:37.282 --> 00:39:38.202]  So is X2.
[00:39:38.202 --> 00:39:39.602]  So is Supermelt Vitality.
[00:39:39.602 --> 00:39:47.484]  And so is our fluoride-free activated charcoal toothpaste from Dr. Jones Naturals, all at infowarestore.com.
[00:39:47.484 --> 00:39:48.365]  Between 25% and 50% off.
[00:39:48.365 --> 00:39:50.725]  They're all great products you need.
[00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:52.866]  And it funds the only independent true media network
[00:39:55.029 --> 00:40:02.373]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[00:40:02.373 --> 00:40:03.814]  We've got two different big sales.
[00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:10.498]  We've got Super Metal Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[00:40:10.498 --> 00:40:15.741]  And we've got Bodies, Vazzo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack,
[00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:16.521]  At 40% off.
[00:40:16.521 --> 00:40:24.348]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:40:24.348 --> 00:40:25.629]  The best deal ever.
[00:40:25.629 --> 00:40:31.053]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:33.815]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:40.741]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that's more critical than ever.
[00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:47.770]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.374]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[00:40:50.374 --> 00:40:52.197]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[00:40:54.929 --> 00:41:08.941]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:10.943]  It's all now completely official.
[00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:15.747]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab.
[00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:21.977]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[00:41:21.977 --> 00:41:22.938]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[00:41:22.938 --> 00:41:23.640]  It's here.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:29.009]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:37.148]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[00:41:37.148 --> 00:41:39.329]  We must start valuing human life again.
[00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:46.233]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:48.974]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:52.376]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[00:41:56.327 --> 00:41:58.748]  The post-industrial world.
[00:41:58.748 --> 00:42:07.991]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:12.492]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[00:42:12.492 --> 00:42:18.374]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[00:42:21.235 --> 00:42:24.238]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[00:42:24.238 --> 00:42:27.381]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:29.343]  It is making the population poor.
[00:42:29.343 --> 00:42:35.248]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:38.551]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it, and they're dystopic.
[00:42:39.512 --> 00:42:40.893]  Image.
[00:42:40.893 --> 00:42:44.814]  We are fighting this at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:51.937]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[00:42:51.937 --> 00:42:52.838]  God bless you.
[00:42:52.838 --> 00:42:55.099]  Visit us, spread the word at Infowars.com.
[00:42:57.247 --> 00:43:04.110]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products in floors are no longer available.
[00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:11.954]  And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[00:43:11.954 --> 00:43:14.015]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[00:43:14.015 --> 00:43:19.798]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[00:43:19.798 --> 00:43:24.260]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.723]  So get your Pollen Block back in stock at InfoWareStore.com today.
[00:43:29.723 --> 00:43:32.665]  And, by the way, Activated Charcoal Toothpaste sold out for months.
[00:43:32.665 --> 00:43:34.106]  It's now back in stock as well.
[00:43:34.106 --> 00:43:36.108]  They're great products and it funds the InfoWare.
[00:43:36.108 --> 00:43:40.811]  So get your Pollen Block and get your Activated Charcoal Toothpaste at InfoWareStore.com today.
[00:43:40.811 --> 00:43:44.493]  Again, our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste doesn't have additives.
[00:43:44.493 --> 00:43:45.414]  It's concentrated.
[00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:46.515]  People love it.
[00:43:46.515 --> 00:43:47.195]  It's amazing.
[00:43:47.195 --> 00:43:48.756]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[00:43:48.756 --> 00:43:50.557]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[00:43:50.557 --> 00:43:52.459]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:59.113 --> 00:44:01.741]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:33.914]  Well, it was 11 months ago we saw the city's locked down, people being welded into their homes, men in hazmat suits, women being shot in the head at checkpoints, people just randomly falling down everywhere.
[00:44:33.914 --> 00:44:37.776]  And all of it was fake, all of it was theater, included with
[00:44:38.837 --> 00:44:44.420]  People racing in with stretchers into hospitals, and then you'd see the camera director waving at everyone.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.861]  People having convulsions.
[00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:47.181]  Why, it was the end of the world!
[00:44:47.181 --> 00:44:49.182]  5% death rates!
[00:44:49.182 --> 00:44:53.365]  Two and a half million Americans will be dead within months!
[00:44:53.365 --> 00:44:59.868]  And then we saw the fake hospitals with the actors going in and out in circles.
[00:44:59.868 --> 00:45:00.648]  We saw it all!
[00:45:00.648 --> 00:45:05.391]  Then a few months in, they said, oh, the whole country is unlocked now.
[00:45:07.042 --> 00:45:09.664]  And now they don't wear their mask and here's some footage.
[00:45:09.664 --> 00:45:16.609]  We'll go ahead and roll this with audio of the New Year celebration in Wuhan and all over China.
[00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:19.491]  Last night they're open for business and we aren't.
[00:45:19.491 --> 00:45:24.115]  But if you look at Times Square or you look at the Seattle Space Needle,
[00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:36.556]  No one's allowed out on the street!
[00:45:36.556 --> 00:45:37.656]  Martial law!
[00:45:37.656 --> 00:45:38.657]  They tried that in Austin.
[00:45:38.657 --> 00:45:40.338]  The governor said it was illegal.
[00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:48.181]  And they showed a giant virus with huge, super complex Operation Blue Beam.
[00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:50.602]  You ever wanted to know what Operation Blue Beam looks like?
[00:45:50.602 --> 00:45:52.123]  That's it.
[00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:54.544]  Now they roll out all the advanced technology.
[00:45:54.544 --> 00:46:02.547]  Now they roll it out and they show you a giant virus opening up like an alien flower and a huge moth being released and spewing out viruses.
[00:46:04.923 --> 00:46:10.046]  They're letting you know you ain't in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:10.046 --> 00:46:13.929]  That's from King 5 Television.
[00:46:13.929 --> 00:46:15.730]  The same thing in New York.
[00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.511]  Same thing in London.
[00:46:17.511 --> 00:46:19.473]  Same thing in Germany.
[00:46:19.473 --> 00:46:22.234]  You're not allowed to have those fireworks, folks.
[00:46:22.234 --> 00:46:25.236]  You're gonna have all that virtual reality.
[00:46:25.236 --> 00:46:29.559]  Oh, but some people still showed up, so they stuck them two-person to a pin.
[00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:33.682]  If they signed up and registered, a few lucky people were allowed to go to New York.
[00:46:35.086 --> 00:46:51.483]  And again, going to Seattle looks like aliens are invading, releasing their viruses, releasing their 5G antennas to then microwave everyone, then now releasing all these new life forms that are flying around and invading us.
[00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:55.247]  Part of this was declassified in the 90s.
[00:46:55.247 --> 00:47:18.162]  They had a multi-million dollar program with giant hologram machines that could show up to 2,000 foot tall alien spacecraft, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, and reportedly did some of this in the first Iraq war, making a bunch of Iraqis give up and wave their arms and say, we will submit.
[00:47:18.162 --> 00:47:19.703]  So imagine, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:26.029]  2,000 foot tall jellyfish swimming around over Seattle.
[00:47:26.029 --> 00:47:28.731]  If you're a radio listener, that's the video at Infowars.com.
[00:47:28.731 --> 00:47:33.094]  We've got the video posted.
[00:47:33.094 --> 00:47:41.841]  In fact, have this video posted in the live show feed area of the show today where we talk about taking the world back from globalists in 2020.
[00:47:41.841 --> 00:47:46.045]  So this is all the stuff they didn't tell you they had, all the stuff that really nobody knew was there.
[00:47:47.782 --> 00:48:02.487]  I told you 16 years ago that a friend of mine who's a big movie producer was talking to James Cameron, and James Cameron said, yeah, we were going to roll out new movie theaters where you sit in a circle around it and it's a hologram, but the decision was made in the future there won't even be movies anymore.
[00:48:02.487 --> 00:48:16.051]  So I'm moving to New Zealand for the end of the world, and I'm going to get all these ships and things so that it looks like I can write it off as an oceanic researcher, but really, in case even New Zealand falls, I've got a fleet of ships.
[00:48:17.369 --> 00:48:19.070]  During the depopulation operation.
[00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:24.011]  Remember I told you that 15, 16 years ago?
[00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:27.873]  And now he admits basically all of that.
[00:48:27.873 --> 00:48:31.694]  And so imagine all the technology they've got.
[00:48:31.694 --> 00:48:32.834]  Life extension, you name it.
[00:48:32.834 --> 00:48:38.516]  They've got mRNA programming that does kill cancer.
[00:48:38.516 --> 00:48:42.337]  They've got gene therapy that 100% knocks out colon cancer.
[00:48:42.337 --> 00:48:43.938]  They've got it that knocks out lung cancer.
[00:48:43.938 --> 00:48:45.679]  They've got it that knocks out brain cancer.
[00:48:45.679 --> 00:48:46.759]  You're not gonna get it.
[00:48:48.376 --> 00:48:50.056]  You know what you get?
[00:48:50.056 --> 00:48:52.877]  Look at that big Illuminati pyramid.
[00:48:52.877 --> 00:48:54.658]  Heaven's Gate deal.
[00:48:54.658 --> 00:48:59.639]  I mean, this is signaling to the cosmos to bring in... Look at that.
[00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:02.300]  Now the space team looks like a flying saucer.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.740]  See how it's all been pre-planned.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.500]  Generation after generation for the rollout.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.201]  Now they say in a year and a half they're going to release all the secret contact with alien information.
[00:49:09.201 --> 00:49:12.902]  They're going to tell you they didn't come from a star system, they came interdimensionally.
[00:49:12.902 --> 00:49:15.323]  But it's really a demonic invasion.
[00:49:18.704 --> 00:49:20.885]  All the super technology can be given to you.
[00:49:20.885 --> 00:49:21.846]  All the life extension.
[00:49:21.846 --> 00:49:25.568]  You've just got to pledge allegiance to the world leader.
[00:49:25.568 --> 00:49:27.129]  What did I tell you yesterday?
[00:49:27.129 --> 00:49:46.099]  How they'll go to the public commons, and they'll go to the public squares, and they'll go to the obelisk, and they will project the image of the beast, and everyone will worship the image of the beast, and everyone worldwide will see the beast at the same time, because it will appear in their markets, and their temples, and their synagogues.
[00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:46.960]  This is the Bible.
[00:49:47.799 --> 00:49:49.240]  And they will worship.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:55.603]  Let's go back to 2012 at the Olympics in London.
[00:49:55.603 --> 00:50:09.449]  A hundred foot tall Grim Reaper with Mary Poppins descending by the hundreds as Grim Reapers, taking the children and putting them in beds and injecting them and then they die.
[00:50:09.449 --> 00:50:13.331]  And then the Grim Reaper takes them up to hell.
[00:50:16.323 --> 00:50:17.964]  Up to hell, you see, the sky.
[00:50:17.964 --> 00:50:22.467]  And here come the nurses, they're the army, they're the force, they're the NIH.
[00:50:22.467 --> 00:50:25.989]  And there are the children, soon to have gags put on their faces.
[00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.690]  Medical sharia law.
[00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:35.935]  And here comes Mary Poppins, now a witch in a dark uniform, an agent born out of the loins of the angel of death, the Grim Reaper.
[00:50:35.935 --> 00:50:40.858]  And now the children will be lifted up into the mouth of the Grim Reaper.
[00:50:40.858 --> 00:50:43.160]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[00:50:44.096 --> 00:50:48.617]  As long as you, like New York and other states, keep the babies comfortable.
[00:50:48.617 --> 00:50:59.841]  We say legally they don't live, even though we keep them alive until all the orders come in, and then we take their organs because it's liberal.
[00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:03.582]  And now they're coming with the mRNA vaccine.
[00:51:03.582 --> 00:51:07.123]  Now they're coming with the mRNA vaccine to take over your entire body.
[00:51:09.926 --> 00:51:21.358]  So the Grim Reaper comes down with his Mary Poppinses, collapses into a pile on the floor, and like Salem's Lot, then rises back up and gathers the children unto death.
[00:51:21.358 --> 00:51:23.521]  Oh, these are the good guys.
[00:51:23.521 --> 00:51:25.203]  These are the Nambla people.
[00:51:25.203 --> 00:51:27.205]  These are the Jeffrey Epstein people.
[00:51:27.205 --> 00:51:29.788]  These are the controllers that think they own you and your family.
[00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:44.299]  And now it's coming out from Linwood and others what we already knew about Chief Justice Roberts and his connections to child kidnapping rings and the Clintons and the disappearing children.
[00:51:44.299 --> 00:51:50.923]  And it's all coming out, but they're telling you in their symphony of death as the Grim Reaper
[00:51:52.142 --> 00:52:04.631]  Because I'm sorry, a 200 foot tall Grim Reaper is a conductor who thou conducts the children floating off the ground up into its arms.
[00:52:04.631 --> 00:52:09.355]  Why is this what they're throwing in our face?
[00:52:09.355 --> 00:52:13.098]  Oh yes, here comes more Grim Reapers to scoop up the children.
[00:52:13.098 --> 00:52:16.680]  So let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.602]  They're partying hard.
[00:52:19.858 --> 00:52:31.926]  They're having a great time, as the drones fly in, the robot drones, with more Little Grim Reapers, to then pick the children up and take them to their deaths.
[00:52:31.926 --> 00:52:37.230]  And the children are so happy, they go, thank you death, thank you, take me, kill me!
[00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:46.076]  And parents all sit there watching this sick spectacle, and billions watch it on TV, and you know it's creepy, you know it's bad, your subconscious knows what it is!
[00:52:48.939 --> 00:52:56.366]  And they're telling you this is a mass human sacrifice ritual as we take your children.
[00:52:56.366 --> 00:52:57.447]  Go to Bandot Video.
[00:52:57.447 --> 00:52:59.469]  See the ancient Middle Ages.
[00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:05.422]  800-year-old carving of the devil eating a child!
[00:53:05.422 --> 00:53:07.884]  And now what do you see at the Space Needle?
[00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:10.005]  Now what do you see at the Olympics?
[00:53:10.005 --> 00:53:11.947]  Now what do you see for real?
[00:53:11.947 --> 00:53:14.749]  Now what do you see coming with the mRNA vaccine?
[00:53:14.749 --> 00:53:15.489]  Death!
[00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:17.250]  Sacrifice of your genetics!
[00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:18.992]  Sacrifice of your fertility!
[00:53:18.992 --> 00:53:22.214]  Sacrifice of your health!
[00:53:22.214 --> 00:53:25.236]  The very takeover of your body!
[00:53:27.136 --> 00:53:39.341]  In a giant genetic ritual with what they cooked up with full clone genomes of jellyfish and humans injected, taking over every cell in your body, cell by cell.
[00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:43.562]  And by the time you figure out you've been hit by it, you don't know what hit you.
[00:53:43.562 --> 00:53:45.683]  All right, Brian, Michael, John, everybody, we're going to your calls.
[00:53:45.683 --> 00:53:49.044]  We come back at six after Stone's on for a couple segments.
[00:53:49.044 --> 00:53:50.325]  I'll go back to your calls.
[00:53:50.325 --> 00:53:52.006]  Then Robert Barnes is coming up.
[00:53:52.006 --> 00:53:52.826]  This is not a game.
[00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:58.148]  Fight back with what God gave us, vitamin D3, winter sun in stock.
[00:53:58.148 --> 00:54:03.492]  Fight back with DNA Force Plus for your mitochondria and your telomeres, back in stock.
[00:54:03.492 --> 00:54:08.176]  Fight back with pollen block that God gave us through these quail eggs, infowarestore.com.
[00:54:08.176 --> 00:54:12.380]  But mainly fight back by praying and getting close to God and realizing it's okay.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.002]  The devil's a failure and will always fail.
[00:54:15.002 --> 00:54:18.686]  And this is only a test we're going through, but we've got to be true, so hold fast.
[00:54:19.346 --> 00:54:21.028]  InfoWarsTore.com in the new year.
[00:54:21.028 --> 00:54:22.569]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:54:22.569 --> 00:54:31.298]  I want to ask you to pledge in the new year, to spread the word about InfoWars and other great outlets of truth, and to support those outlets now more than ever while getting great products.
[00:54:31.298 --> 00:54:37.163]  InfoWarsTore.com, X2, and Super Metal Vitality back in stock, 50% off.
[00:54:37.163 --> 00:54:38.965]  Living Defense discounted as well.
[00:54:38.965 --> 00:54:40.707]  These sales won't last long with the red button.
[00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:50.273]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:54:53.015]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[00:54:53.015 --> 00:54:54.716]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[00:54:54.716 --> 00:54:56.376]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:57.337]  That was a crazy week.
[00:54:57.337 --> 00:55:09.022]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[00:55:09.022 --> 00:55:10.323]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[00:55:11.806 --> 00:55:14.208]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:15.589]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:19.852]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[00:55:19.852 --> 00:55:22.093]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[00:55:22.093 --> 00:55:23.574]  I don't think that happens very often.
[00:55:23.574 --> 00:55:24.375]  It's never happened to me.
[00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:27.297]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[00:55:27.297 --> 00:55:29.018]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[00:55:29.138 --> 00:55:31.899]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:39.883]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[00:55:39.883 --> 00:55:43.205]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[00:55:43.205 --> 00:55:44.726]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:57.427]  It's not a secret why in leftist-controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tent cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[00:55:57.427 --> 00:56:05.212]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[00:56:05.212 --> 00:56:07.593]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[00:56:07.593 --> 00:56:10.335]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[00:56:10.335 --> 00:56:13.037]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[00:56:13.817 --> 00:56:15.578]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[00:56:15.578 --> 00:56:17.720]  They have huge private estates.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.301]  They are separate from us.
[00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:21.162]  Their children go to private tutors.
[00:56:21.162 --> 00:56:22.483]  They admit this.
[00:56:22.483 --> 00:56:30.508]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[00:56:30.948 --> 00:56:36.471]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[00:56:36.471 --> 00:56:38.212]  This is all their admitted plan.
[00:56:38.212 --> 00:56:42.654]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational.
[00:56:42.654 --> 00:56:44.115]  It's a post-human future.
[00:56:44.115 --> 00:56:49.057]  You better find out about it right now.
[00:56:49.057 --> 00:56:51.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.764]  There comes a moment when the beta test is over and the enemy comes.
[00:57:15.764 --> 00:57:17.025]  That assault has begun.
[00:57:17.025 --> 00:57:23.411]  And it means the beginning of the end of Satan's rule on Earth.
[00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:25.893]  But he's gonna have his hour.
[00:57:25.893 --> 00:57:27.755]  We're gonna have to take our licks.
[00:57:27.755 --> 00:57:29.996]  Kathleen in Wisconsin, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:57:29.996 --> 00:57:31.178]  Welcome.
[00:57:31.178 --> 00:57:35.001]  Hi, so there's a couple things I would love to see done.
[00:57:35.001 --> 00:57:37.163]  The first would be a national unmask day.
[00:57:37.978 --> 00:57:39.539]  I think the answer is just what I do.
[00:57:39.539 --> 00:57:42.982]  I just walk in and when they start saying something, I start educating them.
[00:58:07.063 --> 00:58:07.683]  That's true.
[00:58:07.683 --> 00:58:09.464]  It happened to me last week at Whole Foods.
[00:58:09.464 --> 00:58:13.326]  I went in there and I had one of the managers come up with a little train.
[00:58:13.326 --> 00:58:13.526]  He says,
[00:58:36.621 --> 00:58:37.142]  We're good to go.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.660]  That's right, we have to not comply.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:03.802]  And also point out, hey did you know that bacterial pneumonia is spread by masks?
[00:59:03.802 --> 00:59:05.922]  They're filthy, they're dirty, they don't protect you.
[00:59:05.922 --> 00:59:07.523]  It's a symbol of the fear.
[00:59:07.523 --> 00:59:09.143]  It's a symbol of the martial law.
[00:59:09.143 --> 00:59:13.184]  It's a symbol of submission, just like wearing a burqa in Islam.
[00:59:13.184 --> 00:59:17.005]  So I say, either calmly do it or make a scene in these places.
[00:59:17.005 --> 00:59:18.705]  Make scenes!
[00:59:18.705 --> 00:59:20.586]  Well that's another thing too with the masks, I agree.
[00:59:21.727 --> 00:59:24.990]  Yes, she has asthma and in October she was really sick.
[00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:27.712]  She had a fever, stayed home for a week.
[00:59:27.712 --> 00:59:28.533]  My dad's a doctor.
[00:59:28.533 --> 00:59:33.697]  He monitored all of her symptoms and after five days he was afraid of pneumonia and sepsis.
[00:59:33.697 --> 00:59:36.079]  So he brought her to the hospital, of course.
[00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:39.522]  They did the China virus test and he says, well, what about influenza?
[00:59:39.522 --> 00:59:40.883]  Are you going to test for influenza?
[00:59:40.883 --> 00:59:43.746]  No, we don't really see any influenza cases.
[00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:46.710]  She was admitted.
[00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:55.812]  Luckily, she wasn't intubated and she wasn't in the ICU, but they wouldn't let her nebulize in the hospital room because they were worried about aerolization.
[00:59:55.812 --> 01:00:01.654]  But yet, she didn't have to wear her mask while she was in the hospital room and had an active cough.
[01:00:01.654 --> 01:00:09.597]  And, you know, they wouldn't let us send a humidifier to her to let her get humidity in the air because the hospital air is so dry.
[01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:11.598]  So, I said, well, just turn on your shower.
[01:00:11.598 --> 01:00:12.798]  Just blast hot water.
[01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:17.040]  In the shower and a lot of these hospitals to aren't treating people.
[01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:18.174]  I don't know.
[01:00:47.867 --> 01:00:48.647]  Okay.
[01:00:48.647 --> 01:00:51.169]  We got Roger Stone for a couple segments.
[01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.911]  And he's going to be up with us in DC on the 5th and the 6th.
[01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:55.151]  It's going to be huge.
[01:00:55.151 --> 01:01:04.857]  And then after he leaves us, I'm going to go right back to Brian and Michael and John and Charles and Paul and Tim and Dennis and others.
[01:01:04.857 --> 01:01:05.537]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:10.060]  877-789-Alex on this first broadcast of the year 2021.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.661]  Hard to believe here we are.
[01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:15.283]  So we're going to talk about Trump's road to victory with 19 days left.
[01:01:15.283 --> 01:01:16.404]  The big day coming up on the 6th.
[01:01:17.384 --> 01:01:18.465]  What are the real numbers?
[01:01:18.465 --> 01:01:19.206]  What are the real facts?
[01:01:19.206 --> 01:01:20.507]  What are the procedures?
[01:01:20.507 --> 01:01:25.791]  The constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, will be popping in for several segments as well in the third hour.
[01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:32.396]  Then Dale Bigtree, who heads up the big organization of groups fighting the dangers of inoculations, he'll be coming up as well.
[01:01:32.896 --> 01:01:37.221]  Roger Stone is our guest on the other side of this break at 60 seconds.
[01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:43.468]  Please share the live links from Band.Video and the main live show feed at InfoWards.com forward slash show.
[01:01:43.468 --> 01:01:46.271]  It is an act of revolutionary defiance.
[01:01:46.271 --> 01:01:48.274]  It is a victory to override the censors.
[01:01:48.274 --> 01:01:49.936]  So take action, my Paul Reveres!
[01:01:54.482 --> 01:01:55.582]  The Great Reset is here.
[01:01:55.582 --> 01:02:09.366]  The world government has openly been announced, and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family, and to make you so poor, you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income, worse inoculations, and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist, globalist system.
[01:02:09.366 --> 01:02:21.950]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active, and get prepared for self-defense, and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need, so you're not dependent on the system.
[01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:25.011]  We have the best storable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:02:25.011 --> 01:02:27.551]  All the other big competitors have already gone up on their prices.
[01:02:27.551 --> 01:02:31.472]  But our supplier has high quality food in stock ready to ship to you.
[01:02:31.472 --> 01:02:34.293]  And by January 8th, they're going to have to raise prices some.
[01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:35.393]  So take advantage now.
[01:02:35.393 --> 01:02:37.034]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:02:37.034 --> 01:02:42.695]  And on top of that, you can save up to $850 off their regular rates.
[01:02:42.695 --> 01:02:44.795]  Go to PrepareWithAlex.com today.
[01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:46.496]  You've got until January 8th.
[01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:51.757]  And the profit that comes in then helps fund the info war, fighting for America, fighting for justice, fighting for freedom.
[01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:55.879]  A true 360 win.
[01:02:55.879 --> 01:03:05.124]  Old pirates, yes they rob I. Sold I to the merchant ships.
[01:03:05.124 --> 01:03:12.508]  Minutes after they took I. From the bottomless pits.
[01:03:12.508 --> 01:03:16.030]  But my hand was made strong.
[01:03:18.869 --> 01:03:30.200]  These songs are freedom.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.387]  Look at this Washington Post headline.
[01:03:37.387 --> 01:03:39.589]  Anti-vaxxers are dangerous.
[01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:41.731]  Make them face isolation, fines, and arrest.
[01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:52.061]  Even Bloomberg reports 80% of healthcare providers don't want to take it because they say it's been rushed too quick, it's got too many bad side effects, too many deaths, it's not even a vaccine.
[01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:55.966]  Wow, that's coming up later with your phone calls.
[01:03:55.966 --> 01:04:03.774]  But joining us is Roger Stone, recently fully pardoned by the 45th President of the United States, Donald John Trump.
[01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:07.290]  Who has called on everyone to come to D.C.
[01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.470]  on the 5th and the 6th.
[01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:12.512]  We've got a huge event on the 5th that I'm going to be emceeing much of.
[01:04:12.512 --> 01:04:17.273]  It's going to be going on from 12 noon until 8.30 at night.
[01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:21.415]  And that is on the Freedom Plaza, right by the White House.
[01:04:21.415 --> 01:04:23.775]  Roger Stone is going to be speaking there as the keynote speaker.
[01:04:23.775 --> 01:04:27.817]  And then the next day, we're going to be at the White House, right across from the White House on the Ellipse.
[01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:29.444]  I don't
[01:04:55.532 --> 01:04:57.354]  Well, Alex, first of all, Happy New Year.
[01:04:57.354 --> 01:05:00.998]  It's got to be a better year than 2020, although 2020 certainly had its highlights.
[01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:27.178]  Not only the year in which I was convicted, framed really, in a Soviet-style show trial, but also the year in which, through the mercy of God, the President gave me first a commutation, then a full and unconditional pardon.
[01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:31.739]  Yes, it's very important for patriots to go to Washington, D.C.
[01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:36.040]  on January 6th for a peaceful protest, and here is why.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.081]  The fake media psyop
[01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:48.620]  Uh, the, uh, the censorship now of all mass communications, with the exception of radio, so network, cable, internet.
[01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.013]  Print media is completely censored.
[01:05:52.013 --> 01:05:57.494]  This is the first time in the 40 years that I've been in American politics that this has ever happened.
[01:05:57.494 --> 01:06:07.116]  And the way you push back against the fake news media that insists the president's support is dwindling, the president's support is collapsing, Republicans are fleeing.
[01:06:07.116 --> 01:06:07.697]  No.
[01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.017]  Show up in Washington in numbers.
[01:06:10.017 --> 01:06:12.018]  In numbers, there is strength.
[01:06:12.018 --> 01:06:13.198]  Let us show the world.
[01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:21.421]  That we are large, we are strong, we are united, and we're not putting up with the heist of the 2020 election.
[01:06:21.421 --> 01:06:25.603]  That's why this event is so very important.
[01:06:25.603 --> 01:06:34.327]  Roger, we've also seen headlines out there in the Washington Post, the New York Times, in the nation saying, arrest Donald Trump for sedition.
[01:06:35.862 --> 01:06:37.003]  And that was just last week.
[01:06:37.003 --> 01:06:40.744]  And then they lie and say that you and I are calling for violence, that Trump's calling for violence.
[01:06:40.744 --> 01:06:45.026]  It's the left that burnt down cities, that burnt down police stations, and shot people in the head.
[01:06:45.026 --> 01:06:46.606]  We're going to D.C.
[01:06:46.606 --> 01:06:49.868]  like they did in Romania, or like they've done in...
[01:06:51.277 --> 01:06:51.797]  We're good to go.
[01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:12.833]  You know, it's interesting that piece you just showed was written by Sean Wilentz.
[01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:16.157]  Sean Wilentz is a fish-faced enemy of the people.
[01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.618]  He's a leftist.
[01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:25.726]  His father and his uncle ran the Democratic machine in New Jersey for many years, epically corrupt politicians.
[01:07:25.726 --> 01:07:26.967]  So he's not a historian.
[01:07:26.967 --> 01:07:28.489]  He's a propagandist.
[01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:46.449]  The only sedition here that I can see is in the heist and theft of the election, the overwhelming and compelling and growing evidence of voter fraud, the very real evidence of cyber manipulation of the vote.
[01:07:46.449 --> 01:07:50.093]  So, as you and I have experienced over the last two years,
[01:07:50.783 --> 01:07:52.464]  Everything is backwards.
[01:07:52.464 --> 01:07:59.646]  So if they accuse you of colluding with the Russians, that means they were colluding with the Russians, which we know to be a fact.
[01:07:59.646 --> 01:08:13.131]  The Russians helped compile the phony Steele dossier that the Deep State used as the fake justification of their investigation into the Russian collusion, which never existed.
[01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:19.860]  When they accuse us of doing virtually anything, it means they are the ones doing it.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:35.012]  The sedition here is on the part of Joe Biden and the Democrats and their handmaidens in the fake news media because they have been running a very successful PSYOP since before the election.
[01:08:35.012 --> 01:08:35.773]  Let's go through it.
[01:08:36.437 --> 01:08:38.678]  Donald Trump can't possibly win.
[01:08:38.678 --> 01:08:42.541]  His mishandling of COVID-19 was a disaster.
[01:08:42.541 --> 01:08:44.802]  Suburban women are fleeing him in droves.
[01:08:44.802 --> 01:08:45.703]  It's over.
[01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:46.223]  He's dead.
[01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:50.426]  He's going to lose Wisconsin by 17, ABC News poll.
[01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.087]  All of that is false.
[01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:56.310]  Donald Trump fought his way back from the precipice to win when I'm convinced
[01:08:57.091 --> 01:09:02.797]  Based on a lot of examination is a majority of the legal votes cast.
[01:09:02.797 --> 01:09:05.760]  So we're the ones standing up for the rule of law.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.342]  We're the ones standing up for the Constitution.
[01:09:08.342 --> 01:09:10.705]  They are the ones acting seditiously.
[01:09:10.705 --> 01:09:12.887]  Here's a little key going forward.
[01:09:12.887 --> 01:09:17.832]  Anytime any Democrat uses the word rule of law, they're lying.
[01:09:18.556 --> 01:09:28.300]  They didn't care about the rule of law when Bill Clinton was fixing Hillary's illegal email server case on the tarmac with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:41.765]  They didn't care about the rule of law when Joe Biden and Barack Obama used the full authority of the United States government to use falsified data to defraud the FISA court to justify their spying on the Trump campaign.
[01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:44.548]  That's the biggest scandal in American history.
[01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:47.773]  Where was the rule of law then, Jerry Nadler?
[01:09:47.773 --> 01:09:49.956]  Please, this is nonsense.
[01:09:49.956 --> 01:09:52.419]  We are in an epic, epic struggle here.
[01:09:52.419 --> 01:09:55.063]  It's not Republicans versus Democrats.
[01:09:55.063 --> 01:09:57.186]  It's not conservatives versus liberals.
[01:09:57.766 --> 01:10:03.167]  This is about the insiders and an outsider, Donald J. Trump.
[01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:13.190]  This is about a struggle between dark and light, between evil and good, between the godly and the godless, and we dare not fail, Alex.
[01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:16.991]  That's why I will be with you shoulder to shoulder in Washington, D.C.
[01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:17.611]  on January 6th.
[01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:28.095]  Well, this is going to be beyond epic, and obviously you're going to be at both events with me, but I suggest we stick together because this is going to be extremely, extremely historic at the White House.
[01:10:28.095 --> 01:10:29.897]  You're speaking, I'm speaking.
[01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:36.463]  It's going to absolutely have the left go into total, complete conniption fits, and let's expand on that, Roger.
[01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:40.148]  I have had ABC national news host call me up.
[01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:42.390]  I've had others from Fox call me.
[01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.652]  I've had Democrat party lawyers call me and go, Alex, we like you.
[01:10:45.652 --> 01:10:48.715]  I bet we can get you replatformed.
[01:10:48.715 --> 01:10:50.076]  Please don't do this in D.C.
[01:10:50.076 --> 01:10:51.017]  You're going to be in danger.
[01:10:51.017 --> 01:10:52.638]  Somebody might shoot you.
[01:10:52.638 --> 01:10:55.100]  Oh, please don't lead a violent revolution.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.702]  And really what they're doing is calling up and threatening me.
[01:10:57.702 --> 01:11:00.584]  So they're really concerned about the six, Roger.
[01:11:00.584 --> 01:11:02.866]  I mean, if they got it in the bag so much, why are they doing this?
[01:11:04.512 --> 01:11:09.994]  Because in numbers there is strength, but let's be very clear, we renounce violence.
[01:11:09.994 --> 01:11:11.175]  We're not for violence.
[01:11:11.175 --> 01:11:16.837]  It was four Trump supporters who got stabbed after the last DC event.
[01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:22.559]  It was 82 Trump supporters who were badly injured in attacks by Antifa.
[01:11:23.299 --> 01:11:30.861]  This is my greatest concern because our events are essentially grassroots-oriented pop-up events.
[01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:35.322]  We don't have the big bucks that George Soros has for security.
[01:11:35.322 --> 01:11:39.223]  I actually set up StopTheSteal.org.
[01:11:39.223 --> 01:11:49.066]  This is to raise money solely for security, solely for transportation and security of people to protect those peaceful citizens who show up.
[01:11:50.007 --> 01:11:52.629]  I don't want to see any more stabbings or beatings.
[01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:53.910]  We renounce violence.
[01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.711]  Violence is a tactic of the left.
[01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.051]  That's right.
[01:11:56.051 --> 01:11:58.893]  That's why I'm asking you, why is the left so concerned about our rally?
[01:11:58.893 --> 01:12:06.839]  Because they know it's going to show that Biden, who can't even get a high school auditorium full, is a fraud.
[01:12:06.839 --> 01:12:08.580]  That's precisely why they're scared.
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.042]  The idea of a million Americans converging on Washington, D.C.
[01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:16.125]  to protest the heist of the 2020 election was not in their script.
[01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:33.755]  At this point, you have virtually every element of the Republican establishment who owe so very much to Donald Trump, who led that party back to being a majority party of working class people, telling us, oh, telling the president, oh, no, pack it in.
[01:12:33.755 --> 01:12:34.776]  You've got to concede.
[01:12:34.776 --> 01:12:36.858]  You need to think about history.
[01:12:36.858 --> 01:12:37.518]  Nonsense.
[01:12:37.518 --> 01:12:42.122]  The president won this election and he should keep fighting right to the end.
[01:12:42.302 --> 01:12:42.643]  I agree.
[01:12:42.643 --> 01:12:47.215]  Let's look at all the angles of that and Georgia and more and what if Biden gets in, what happens next?
[01:12:47.215 --> 01:12:49.200]  We'll be back with Roger Stone on Alex Jones.
[01:12:52.478 --> 01:12:57.020]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.562]  This is taken under the tongue.
[01:12:59.562 --> 01:13:01.763]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:13:01.763 --> 01:13:10.968]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:13:10.968 --> 01:13:16.811]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[01:13:16.811 --> 01:13:18.952]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:13:19.412 --> 01:13:22.633]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[01:13:22.633 --> 01:13:24.494]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[01:13:24.494 --> 01:13:26.595]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[01:13:26.595 --> 01:13:28.796]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[01:13:28.796 --> 01:13:30.156]  Some like bodies better.
[01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:34.278]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[01:13:34.278 --> 01:13:35.478]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[01:13:52.665 --> 01:13:54.345]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[01:13:54.345 --> 01:13:55.766]  Thank you for holding.
[01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:57.266]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.667]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.907]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[01:13:59.907 --> 01:14:00.627]  How are you?
[01:14:00.627 --> 01:14:01.427]  I love you, man.
[01:14:01.427 --> 01:14:03.748]  I want to make a quick plug.
[01:14:03.748 --> 01:14:05.629]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:12.051]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin,
[01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:22.081]  Which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[01:14:22.739 --> 01:14:28.141]  And it helped channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:41.646]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost something like 50 bucks.
[01:14:41.646 --> 01:14:46.367]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:47.808]  So thanks for the plug.
[01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.643]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:23.075]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:24.938]  Got a hold of me.
[01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.741]  Yeah, we got two of the real bad boys here.
[01:15:27.895 --> 01:15:29.676]  There's truly Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[01:15:29.676 --> 01:15:32.458]  Roger Stone did absolutely nothing wrong.
[01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.099]  I was there.
[01:15:33.099 --> 01:15:36.541]  He was working in Infowars during the campaign and officially worked here after.
[01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:41.285]  And I knew everything he said was true in the media, because I was heavily involved in it all.
[01:15:41.285 --> 01:15:43.867]  Notice, they didn't want to call me as a witness, the feds.
[01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:46.469]  Instead, they had Steve Bannon, who contradicted himself.
[01:15:46.469 --> 01:15:48.390]  That's a whole other kettle of fish.
[01:15:49.591 --> 01:15:54.118]  What is it like for you, Roger, and we'll get back into the current developments, to be, I know, loved.
[01:15:54.118 --> 01:15:59.766]  I'll go down the street with you and you shake 50 hands before somebody goes, F you Russian, hope you effing die.
[01:15:59.766 --> 01:16:01.528]  Same thing happens to me.
[01:16:01.528 --> 01:16:04.713]  But you were telling me that now that you've been pardoned, it's gotten even worse.
[01:16:04.713 --> 01:16:05.414]  They're really mad.
[01:16:07.242 --> 01:16:10.083]  Alex, it's a flashpoint, I guess.
[01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:13.284]  Some extraordinarily polarizing figure.
[01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:14.744]  I don't really care about that.
[01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:21.586]  The people who are with me, the people who prayed for me, the people who sustained me through this, God bless them.
[01:16:21.586 --> 01:16:25.887]  Every once in a while we run into some nut job.
[01:16:25.887 --> 01:16:33.189]  I really do need security when I go to Washington or when I travel anywhere outside of Fort Lauderdale and even in some places of South Florida.
[01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:35.730]  Roger, I've got about 20 security guys.
[01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:39.133]  I know you've got a few, so you can just join up with us.
[01:16:39.133 --> 01:16:43.877]  You know, Alex, I'm putting in sometimes 17, 18-hour days.
[01:16:43.877 --> 01:16:55.866]  I'm trying to finish my book, which is entitled, Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong, My Political Persecution and the Heist of the 2020 Election, because they are very intricately connected.
[01:16:55.866 --> 01:16:58.307]  I'm trying to finish the script for a documentary.
[01:16:58.307 --> 01:17:00.529]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:17:00.529 --> 01:17:02.871]  If I was not using Brain Force Plus,
[01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:04.922]  There's no way.
[01:17:04.922 --> 01:17:07.063]  This is a great product.
[01:17:07.063 --> 01:17:09.584]  I'm paid nothing to tell you this, folks.
[01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:11.765]  I'm telling you this because it's the truth.
[01:17:11.765 --> 01:17:23.410]  This stuff gives me a lift of energy, both mental and creative energy, kind of helps organize your mind, but it doesn't leave you awake staring at the ceiling late at night when you can't sleep.
[01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:26.831]  So I cannot recommend Brain Force Plus enough.
[01:17:26.831 --> 01:17:27.592]  I swear by it.
[01:17:28.492 --> 01:17:29.773]  Roger, I appreciate your plug.
[01:17:29.773 --> 01:17:34.335]  BrainForce Plus is a good, clean, natural nootropic for the brain, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:34.335 --> 01:17:41.677]  I didn't know we were going to do that plug, but I appreciate your support, because without you and the listeners, this broadcast would not be here, my friend.
[01:17:41.677 --> 01:17:42.498]  Now, let's pull back.
[01:17:42.498 --> 01:17:45.579]  I've got to ask a lot of questions, but what else is front and center for you?
[01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:51.561]  Your advice to the President, his chances, what you expect to see in the Senate and the House next week?
[01:17:51.561 --> 01:17:54.162]  I know you've got a lot of inside sources.
[01:17:54.162 --> 01:17:55.183]  What is the sense right now?
[01:17:56.212 --> 01:18:03.597]  Well, the thing that perplexes me, and I don't know the answer, Alex, is why the president left Mar-a-Lago, his palatial
[01:18:04.158 --> 01:18:04.418]  I think?
[01:18:27.851 --> 01:18:30.133]  Many, many supporters and friends.
[01:18:30.133 --> 01:18:38.080]  For him to abandon that and return back to Washington tells me that he is doing so because of some official business.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:51.032]  I have no inside track on what this means other than to say I believe it means something because this is an event that has great sentimental affection for the President and he is going to miss it.
[01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:54.761]  I don't know what's afoot in Washington.
[01:18:54.761 --> 01:19:02.045]  As you know, the Iranians are making hostile noises, but the President has always handled them appropriately.
[01:19:02.045 --> 01:19:05.306]  But I don't know what is afoot.
[01:19:05.306 --> 01:19:13.671]  I do know that there are now more than enough House members to object to the certification of the Electoral College.
[01:19:14.311 --> 01:19:15.092]  We're good.
[01:19:32.179 --> 01:19:42.432]  There is a peaceful protest, a peaceful event, just down the street from Rick Scott's house this Sunday at 1 o'clock in Naples, Florida.
[01:19:42.432 --> 01:19:45.336]  We ask people to join us there.
[01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:48.921]  We are respectfully and peacefully calling on the President
[01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:56.802]  Pardon me, calling on Senator Scott, the Senator from Florida, to stand with the President on January 6th.
[01:19:56.802 --> 01:19:58.883]  So, that is this Sunday.
[01:19:58.883 --> 01:20:02.963]  It's at 5400 Timiani Trail.
[01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:06.984]  You can find it all over the internet.
[01:20:06.984 --> 01:20:09.764]  Please join us for this peaceful post-test.
[01:20:09.764 --> 01:20:18.386]  We're going to respectfully ask Senator Scott to get on board and be one of those who seconds the motion objecting to the certification
[01:20:19.246 --> 01:20:22.049]  Of the electors.
[01:20:22.049 --> 01:20:24.310]  Well, I've got to say this, Roger.
[01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:39.742]  I am so proud of the populace, the Christians, the conservatives, the nationalists, the common sense people that have fought so hard for six years, two years to get Trump elected, four years of Trump being embattled.
[01:20:39.742 --> 01:20:45.727]  And now this epic fight for our right to vote against this globalist TICOM takeover.
[01:20:46.087 --> 01:20:48.608]  I've got concerns about Trump and the vaccines.
[01:20:48.608 --> 01:20:51.229]  I was mad when he tacitly agreed with red flag laws.
[01:20:51.229 --> 01:21:01.953]  Trump's not perfect, but he got elected, he's our president, the globalists hate him, and they're trying to remove him from office via fraud right now, and so that's why we've got to back him 110%.
[01:21:01.953 --> 01:21:04.154]  Your comments on that?
[01:21:04.154 --> 01:21:14.578]  Look, you're 100% right, and he's got a number of options right now that he could do that would flummox the deep state.
[01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:25.338]  I've called on him, for example, before if he should leave office, or even by the end of this term, he should declassify all of the John F. Kennedy assassination records.
[01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:31.536]  He declassified a substantial number of them in the second year of his term.
[01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:34.480]  It is now time to declassify all of them.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:40.707]  I have urged him to grant a presidential pardon to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.
[01:21:40.707 --> 01:21:43.210]  No, Assange is not a Russian asset.
[01:21:43.210 --> 01:21:46.614]  That's nonsense invented by John Brennan.
[01:21:47.154 --> 01:22:00.097]  Snowden's big crime is that he seems to have proved that John Brennan was lying when he told us, pardon me, James Clapper was lying when he told us there was no metadata collection program on average American citizens.
[01:22:00.097 --> 01:22:01.437]  That was a lie.
[01:22:01.437 --> 01:22:12.419]  So if the president wants to, uh, wants to strike back at the deep state for their efforts to deny him his rightful second term, there are several ways there that he could do so.
[01:22:13.567 --> 01:22:17.028]  Roger, you've been around a lot longer than I have, but I've been around a while now.
[01:22:17.028 --> 01:22:20.230]  I've never seen anything like this, never read anything like this in a history book.
[01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:22.331]  I mean, we're in uncharted territory right now, aren't we?
[01:22:22.331 --> 01:22:28.533]  We're going to look back on this as a spectacularly incredible, dangerous time.
[01:22:28.533 --> 01:22:29.854]  There's no question about that.
[01:22:29.854 --> 01:22:42.399]  But the thing that's different about this than every other challenge is, for the first time, they have succeeded in maintaining and enforcing censorship of all mass communications.
[01:22:43.332 --> 01:22:55.395]  I thought it was very interesting when you had the young serviceman Ivan Reiklin, who's a friend of mine, talked about use of the emergency broadcast system to tell the American people the truth.
[01:22:55.395 --> 01:22:57.475]  I think this is a great idea.
[01:22:57.475 --> 01:23:00.976]  I think it is one of the ideas the president should consider.
[01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.996]  He has the bully pulpit.
[01:23:02.996 --> 01:23:06.077]  I'm sorry MSNBC and CNN.
[01:23:06.077 --> 01:23:10.958]  The evidence of election fraud is growing, overwhelming, and compelling.
[01:23:11.559 --> 01:23:20.344]  You can close your eyes and pretend it's not there, but the next thing you know, you'll be telling us there is no such thing as gravity and the world is flat.
[01:23:20.344 --> 01:23:25.547]  Not only that, but the evidence of cyber communications is overwhelming.
[01:23:25.547 --> 01:23:31.510]  The president has the bully pulpit to make sure the American people understand what has really... That's right, Roger.
[01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:32.770]  So let's talk about this.
[01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:36.893]  One other area he's failing, he's given some great speeches, done some great stuff, hasn't conceded.
[01:23:36.893 --> 01:23:38.854]  He should be at the Resolute Desk every night.
[01:23:39.755 --> 01:23:44.222]  You know, calling the troops in, warning the American people, rallying the public.
[01:23:44.222 --> 01:23:49.832]  So let's talk about what he should do when we come back with 19 days until they try to coronate Joe Biden.
[01:23:50.816 --> 01:23:54.898]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[01:23:54.898 --> 01:23:57.279]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[01:23:57.279 --> 01:24:04.922]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[01:24:04.922 --> 01:24:08.804]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[01:24:08.804 --> 01:24:12.285]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[01:24:12.285 --> 01:24:14.726]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[01:24:14.726 --> 01:24:17.107]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought!
[01:24:17.107 --> 01:24:18.928]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine!
[01:24:19.668 --> 01:24:25.931]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:26.872]  Okay?
[01:24:26.872 --> 01:24:31.454]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[01:24:31.454 --> 01:24:33.736]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.556]  These are real numbers.
[01:24:34.556 --> 01:24:35.837]  These are real facts.
[01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:43.221]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:44.483]  Rebuke it.
[01:24:44.483 --> 01:24:45.686]  Stand up against it.
[01:24:45.686 --> 01:24:47.431]  This is slavery.
[01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:49.656]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:54.833]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[01:24:54.833 --> 01:25:04.519]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the COVID as the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[01:25:04.519 --> 01:25:07.781]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[01:25:07.781 --> 01:25:10.383]  That's why you see somebody dying in southern nursing homes.
[01:25:10.383 --> 01:25:20.710]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically
[01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.370]  I think so.
[01:25:50.773 --> 01:25:59.563]  Our Activated Charcoal Toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because Activated Charcoal is already one of the top-selling, fastest-growing toothpaste out there.
[01:25:59.563 --> 01:26:06.250]  The problem is, a lot of the other over-the-counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very toxic, and also they have fluoride in them.
[01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:07.950]  This does not have the fluoride.
[01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:09.371]  It doesn't have the additives.
[01:26:09.371 --> 01:26:10.591]  This is a concentrate.
[01:26:10.591 --> 01:26:12.032]  It really is high quality.
[01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:17.213]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:18.974]  But now it's back in stock.
[01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:23.415]  InfoWars Dr. Jones Naturals Activated Charcoal Toothpaste.

[01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:11.215 --> 01:27:14.036]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's game time.
[01:27:14.036 --> 01:27:18.877]  The battle for the Republic, now in sudden death overtime.
[01:27:18.877 --> 01:27:23.858]  We are tied in a dead heat against the Globalists and the Chaikons.
[01:27:23.858 --> 01:27:27.459]  But America is not surrendering.
[01:27:27.459 --> 01:27:30.220]  You can't cut the suspense with a jackhammer.
[01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:33.519]  All right, final segment with Roger Stone.
[01:27:33.519 --> 01:27:37.980]  Your call's coming up, and Robert Barnes joins us, and Dale Bigtree, and so much more.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.700]  Roger, you were saying some powerful stuff during the break.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:49.942]  I know you can't get to it all, but just for folks, you were saying, in your own words, repeat what you were just telling me during the break.
[01:27:49.942 --> 01:27:52.363]  Well, Alex, here's the thing that I know.
[01:27:52.363 --> 01:27:56.103]  I have known the president for now 41 years.
[01:27:56.103 --> 01:28:00.784]  The only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he's completely unpredictable.
[01:28:01.951 --> 01:28:21.274]  And therefore, for him to leave his beloved Mar-a-Lago and to leave his palatial and incredibly opulent New Year's Eve party that was hosted there by the club, to return to Washington, his return has to be triggered by something significant.
[01:28:22.029 --> 01:28:24.152]  I'm not second-guessing the President of the United States.
[01:28:24.152 --> 01:28:26.234]  I don't know what he has up his sleeve.
[01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.435]  I do know this.
[01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.078]  Whatever it is, I will support him 1,000%.
[01:28:30.078 --> 01:28:34.663]  He is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.
[01:28:34.663 --> 01:28:40.830]  He is an existential threat to the two-party duopoly that's run the country into the ground.
[01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:43.673]  They tried four different times that we know of.
[01:28:44.073 --> 01:28:45.053]  To remove him.
[01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:49.235]  How many attempts were there to remove him that we don't know about?
[01:28:49.235 --> 01:28:50.516]  But he's a brawler.
[01:28:50.516 --> 01:28:51.496]  He's a fighter.
[01:28:51.496 --> 01:28:54.577]  He's going to go down fighting if he's going down at all.
[01:28:54.577 --> 01:28:57.379]  He is the rightful winner of this election.
[01:28:57.379 --> 01:29:00.900]  The true results demonstrate that.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:07.703]  But if we reach a point in America in which one cannot get a fair and impartial judicial decision,
[01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:26.046]  And we cannot get a fair, impartial, honest, transparent election, and our legislative process is constipated by special interests, influence, and fear, well then there's no avenue to fix what's wrong with America.
[01:29:26.046 --> 01:29:30.187]  There's no avenue to reform, for reform.
[01:29:30.187 --> 01:29:32.567]  I tremble to think about what that means.
[01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:36.728]  Donald Trump is our last, best hope to save this nation.
[01:29:37.288 --> 01:29:56.200]  Four more years of a Trump presidency, knowing what he now knows and fully understanding the evil of the deep state and the permanent government in place, the next four years would be extraordinary in terms of him fixing America.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:03.184]  That's why this fight is so vitally important and why we need to see all of you in Washington, D.C.
[01:30:03.184 --> 01:30:04.045]  It's also why
[01:30:04.785 --> 01:30:06.366]  We must get a U.S.
[01:30:06.366 --> 01:30:20.557]  Senator to second the motion of Mo Brooks and Matt Gaetz and other great patriots in the House to have open debate on the motion to certify the electors.
[01:30:20.557 --> 01:30:29.003]  There is a demonstration this Sunday, a peaceful, respectful demonstration at 5400 Tamiami Trail North
[01:30:30.084 --> 01:30:39.531]  That's at the northeast corner of US 41 and Pine Ridge Road in Naples, right outside Senator Rick Scott's home.
[01:30:39.531 --> 01:30:54.482]  Again, this is a peaceful, friendly, respectful event to urge the Senator to do the right thing and to stand with Donald Trump, stand with the Constitution, stand with the American people against this steal.
[01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.763]  I'm going to be there.
[01:30:55.763 --> 01:30:59.006]  I urge anybody in South Florida who can't make it to Washington,
[01:30:59.326 --> 01:31:02.330]  Roger, let's pull back here with the 100,000 foot view from the edge of space looking down on Earth.
[01:31:12.878 --> 01:31:14.139]  Trump's got stuff up his sleeve.
[01:31:14.139 --> 01:31:15.359]  We know there was total fraud.
[01:31:15.359 --> 01:31:20.202]  The evidence is ridiculously, cartoon level, open and shut in these five states.
[01:31:20.202 --> 01:31:21.922]  As you said, we've got Josh Hawley.
[01:31:21.922 --> 01:31:23.963]  We don't have another senator to second it.
[01:31:23.963 --> 01:31:28.065]  We've got Pence coming back saying he now won't be out of the country, won't be going to Israel.
[01:31:28.065 --> 01:31:28.826]  He's going to be there.
[01:31:28.826 --> 01:31:30.247]  So everybody's coming back to D.C.
[01:31:30.247 --> 01:31:31.027]  right now.
[01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:33.108]  You can tell there's some big meetings going on.
[01:31:33.108 --> 01:31:36.490]  Trump's obviously up there wrangling more senators, more House members.
[01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:42.332]  How will that look if he's able to discount those five states?
[01:31:42.332 --> 01:31:44.012]  Obviously, the evidence is there.
[01:31:44.012 --> 01:31:48.293]  Don't you expect they'll procedurally move to have a new election in the five states?
[01:31:48.293 --> 01:31:52.055]  I think that's the fairest thing to do.
[01:31:52.055 --> 01:31:56.776]  I would favor that, but I'm not a constitutional lawyer, nor am I an expert.
[01:31:56.776 --> 01:32:02.638]  The thing I like about this is, this is the mandated constitutional process.
[01:32:03.365 --> 01:32:17.319]  Very hard to say that the president is involved in an act of sedition when all he is doing and all his supporters are doing is utilizing the current legal process in the appropriate way.
[01:32:18.098 --> 01:32:21.079]  We cannot get a fair, honest judicial proceeding.
[01:32:21.079 --> 01:32:22.839]  That blows my mind.
[01:32:22.839 --> 01:32:26.480]  The case presented by the state of Texas was overwhelming.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:28.500]  It was compelling.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.941]  It was legally correct.
[01:32:29.941 --> 01:32:31.541]  It was not flawed.
[01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:35.382]  The court's decision not to hear it is outrageous.
[01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:36.622]  Outrageous.
[01:32:36.622 --> 01:32:43.824]  I would look at those Bush-appointed justices with the exception of that great patriot Clarence Thomas.
[01:32:44.644 --> 01:32:57.566]  As far as to that action, the fact that we cannot get a fair hearing in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the site of more theft than I think perhaps any other state.
[01:32:57.566 --> 01:33:00.407]  That's why we have to go this route.
[01:33:00.407 --> 01:33:02.987]  That's why we are rallying in Washington.
[01:33:02.987 --> 01:33:10.869]  That's why it's vitally important that Republicans of good faith stand up for this president on January 6th.
[01:33:10.869 --> 01:33:13.249]  I read where a senator-elect
[01:33:13.769 --> 01:33:25.963]  Tuberville from Alabama, the patriot who defeated Jeff Sessions in the Senate comeback bid that he launched, has said that he is considering seconding the motion.
[01:33:25.963 --> 01:33:31.950]  That would make Senator Tuberville a national figure overnight and a hero to the American people.
[01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:35.979]  So I am praying that this all comes together.
[01:33:35.979 --> 01:33:37.199]  Well, why would they not do it?
[01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:48.383]  I mean, we have cartoon-level fraud where they close it, board up the windows, pull out the black suitcases, and start running it over and over again, saying a water main burst, and then right when they do it, it spikes for Biden.
[01:33:48.383 --> 01:33:49.863]  And the same thing in the other states.
[01:33:49.863 --> 01:33:51.084]  It's cartoon-level!
[01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:56.185]  It's like Wiley Cowlett with a sheep on top of his head, sneaking off with it.
[01:33:56.185 --> 01:34:01.307]  The reason that they would not do it is because the establishment Republican Party
[01:34:02.337 --> 01:34:05.258]  ...wants Donald Trump off the stage as quickly as the Democrats.
[01:34:05.258 --> 01:34:07.279]  See, they like the status quo.
[01:34:07.279 --> 01:34:14.042]  They don't mind being in the minority, as long as they get some nice crumbs from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
[01:34:14.042 --> 01:34:29.208]  And they are backed by the fake news media, those jackals in the media, who will not let the fact that this cartoon-level corruption be seen, be heard, be exposed to the American people.
[01:34:29.688 --> 01:34:41.667]  As I said earlier, it's a PSYOP and in 40 years in American politics, I have never seen a situation in which virtually every element of mass communications in this country
[01:34:42.532 --> 01:34:43.193]  It's censored.
[01:34:43.193 --> 01:34:45.014]  Isn't that Trump's biggest failure?
[01:34:45.014 --> 01:34:46.115]  He talked a lot.
[01:34:46.115 --> 01:34:46.795]  He said a lot.
[01:34:46.795 --> 01:34:48.516]  Now he's trying to get 230 repealed.
[01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:55.581]  But he should have understood that allowing this censorship would end up... I mean, they're now censoring Senate fraud hearings on the election.
[01:34:55.581 --> 01:34:57.502]  Google says, well, we're not going to let you see this.
[01:34:57.502 --> 01:34:59.224]  I mean, this is sedition.
[01:34:59.224 --> 01:35:00.204]  This is dangerous.
[01:35:00.204 --> 01:35:02.646]  If the Soviet Union did this, we'd go to war with them.
[01:35:02.646 --> 01:35:04.667]  If the Chinese were controlling our media, we'd get upset.
[01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:07.569]  But it's big tech in league with the Communist Chinese.
[01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:07.830]  Roger?
[01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:11.033]  I can't wait to see you in DC.
[01:35:11.033 --> 01:35:12.394]  I'm getting in there Monday evening.
[01:35:12.394 --> 01:35:14.436]  When do you get in?
[01:35:14.436 --> 01:35:15.377]  That's a little unclear.
[01:35:15.377 --> 01:35:21.844]  I'm still working on the logistics, and I don't like to say a lot for security purposes, but I will be there, Alex.
[01:35:21.844 --> 01:35:28.632]  I will be shoulder to shoulder with you and so many other great patriots for this important, peaceful protest.
[01:35:28.632 --> 01:35:30.674]  So folks, if you can get to Washington,
[01:35:31.218 --> 01:35:32.538]  Please see us there.
[01:35:32.538 --> 01:35:40.501]  If you can't, go to stopthesteal.org and help us pay for some professional security to protect our peaceful project.
[01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:40.881]  Absolutely.
[01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:44.923]  And in closing, this is bigger than the inauguration of Trump, gut level.
[01:35:44.923 --> 01:35:48.164]  I think this is the biggest historical thing in our lifetimes.
[01:35:48.164 --> 01:35:50.084]  I've never been involved in something this important, Roger.
[01:35:50.084 --> 01:35:51.785]  This is the biggest thing in my life so far.
[01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:59.937]  Well, and unlike the inauguration, I will not have to wear a top hat, so that part... Alright, Roger, we really appreciate you.
[01:35:59.937 --> 01:36:01.819]  God bless, and I'll see you in the swamp.
[01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:03.510]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:06.171]  I look forward to seeing you there, and Godspeed.
[01:36:06.171 --> 01:36:07.091]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:36:07.091 --> 01:36:10.312]  Folks, I will ask listeners, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, please pray for Roger.
[01:36:10.312 --> 01:36:11.752]  Please pray for myself.
[01:36:11.752 --> 01:36:12.852]  My parents get really concerned.
[01:36:12.852 --> 01:36:13.512]  Everybody else does.
[01:36:13.512 --> 01:36:14.813]  I'm obviously a big target.
[01:36:14.813 --> 01:36:17.173]  Roger's just as big, maybe bigger.
[01:36:17.173 --> 01:36:22.194]  And so, if there's a deck of cards, Trump's the ace of spades, and Roger and I are like the next cards.
[01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:23.955]  And it's not like you want to be those top cards.
[01:36:23.955 --> 01:36:24.715]  It's not fun.
[01:36:24.715 --> 01:36:28.136]  But it's our mission, and I'm, you know, I asked for this, so I'm in this position.
[01:36:29.036 --> 01:36:35.482]  But I pray, I pray that you pray for us because one of the safest places to be in the world will be DC for the average person.
[01:36:35.482 --> 01:36:41.648]  But for Donald Trump or Roger Stone or Alex Jones, it is not a happy camper's paradise, I can tell you.
[01:36:41.648 --> 01:36:44.911]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and Robert Barnes is coming up.
[01:36:44.911 --> 01:36:46.873]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:57.197]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[01:36:57.197 --> 01:36:58.639]  We've got two different big sales.
[01:36:58.639 --> 01:37:05.886]  We've got Super Bowl Vitality, Turbo Force, and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:10.571]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack,
[01:37:10.871 --> 01:37:10.971]  It's
[01:37:33.735 --> 01:37:36.776]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[01:37:36.776 --> 01:37:39.677]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[01:38:03.573 --> 01:38:07.055]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[01:38:07.055 --> 01:38:12.158]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[01:38:12.158 --> 01:38:16.400]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[01:38:17.799 --> 01:38:27.423]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:38:27.423 --> 01:38:31.544]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[01:38:31.544 --> 01:38:38.026]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[01:38:38.026 --> 01:38:43.569]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[01:38:43.569 --> 01:38:44.469]  So help me God.
[01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:47.122]  Infowars.com BAM.video
[01:38:50.948 --> 01:38:58.811]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[01:38:58.811 --> 01:39:04.054]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[01:39:04.054 --> 01:39:10.876]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices, and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[01:39:10.876 --> 01:39:14.338]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[01:39:14.338 --> 01:39:16.599]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[01:39:16.599 --> 01:39:19.060]  The globalists are waging siege against us.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.584]  We're trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:29.088]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:40.378]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at preparewithalex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storable foods out there.
[01:39:40.798 --> 01:39:51.225]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at preparewithalex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high-quality, storable food.
[01:39:51.225 --> 01:39:52.226]  The Resistance.
[01:39:52.226 --> 01:39:53.647]  Video.
[01:39:53.647 --> 01:39:54.788]  The Resistance.
[01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:56.068]  Video.
[01:39:56.068 --> 01:39:57.129]  The Resistance.
[01:39:57.129 --> 01:39:58.290]  Video.
[01:39:58.290 --> 01:39:59.451]  The Resistance.
[01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:00.471]  Video.
[01:40:00.471 --> 01:40:01.672]  The Resistance.
[01:40:01.672 --> 01:40:02.613]  Video.
[01:40:02.613 --> 01:40:03.613]  The Resistance.
[01:40:03.613 --> 01:40:03.874]  Video.
[01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:14.462]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Ban.Video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[01:40:14.462 --> 01:40:18.187]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[01:40:20.690 --> 01:40:24.373]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[01:40:24.373 --> 01:40:29.056]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:30.977]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:40:30.977 --> 01:40:35.441]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[01:40:35.441 --> 01:40:46.048]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.Video.
[01:40:46.048 --> 01:40:46.969]  Share the link.
[01:40:46.969 --> 01:40:48.550]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:49.591]  TheResistance.Video.
[01:40:53.849 --> 01:41:12.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:12.003 --> 01:41:19.689]  A lot of people see Trump in trouble and so they say, oh well Trump's bad on the vaccine or Trump's bad on this or that.
[01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:20.550]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:21.618 --> 01:41:29.980]  But Trump, overall I believe, means well and is fighting the globalists and they hate him and are trying to get rid of him and are trying to steal this election that's our vote.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:37.462]  So that's why I back Trump 110% and I'm praying for him because this is an incredible time to be alive right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:37.462 --> 01:41:49.506]  All right, we are taking your phone calls and the reason Rush Limbaugh, God bless him, says dittos is if you say, hey, I like you, hey, you like me, we can't get to everybody.
[01:41:50.345 --> 01:41:52.325]  So I'm not going to say thanks for the call.
[01:41:52.325 --> 01:41:53.306]  I'm taking you all right now.
[01:41:53.306 --> 01:41:54.826]  I'm just going to go to the next person.
[01:41:54.826 --> 01:41:55.386]  Hang up on you.
[01:41:55.386 --> 01:41:56.026]  Go to the next person.
[01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:57.207]  Get everybody on here.
[01:41:57.207 --> 01:41:59.127]  Okay, Brian in Colorado.
[01:41:59.127 --> 01:41:59.927]  Thanks for holding.
[01:41:59.927 --> 01:42:00.367]  I just said it.
[01:42:00.367 --> 01:42:00.827]  You're on the air.
[01:42:00.827 --> 01:42:02.408]  Go ahead.
[01:42:02.408 --> 01:42:07.609]  Yeah, I wanted to speak a little bit to the parents out there.
[01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:15.471]  I have two small children and anybody that's engaging in this mask situation is really harming them.
[01:42:16.317 --> 01:42:22.527]  And I think it's a form of child abuse, and I really would like it if people would stop participating in that.
[01:42:22.527 --> 01:42:23.428]  I agree.
[01:42:23.428 --> 01:42:29.497]  When I see people, especially with three or four year olds with those damn masks on, and them trying to make babies wear it, I want to kick their ass.
[01:42:31.095 --> 01:42:34.498]  Indeed, let's not get violent, but... No, no, you know what I mean.
[01:42:34.498 --> 01:42:35.959]  It's child abuse.
[01:42:35.959 --> 01:42:41.583]  Dude, listen, I don't have asthma, and I'm not really somebody that gets scared in confined places.
[01:42:41.583 --> 01:42:42.604]  I've gotten older.
[01:42:42.604 --> 01:42:43.504]  I've gotten a little bit more.
[01:42:43.504 --> 01:42:45.686]  What do you call that when you don't like being in confined spaces?
[01:42:45.686 --> 01:42:46.246]  What's that name?
[01:42:46.246 --> 01:42:48.228]  I have one of those moments.
[01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.188]  Claustrophobia.
[01:42:49.188 --> 01:42:51.450]  I've gotten a little more claustrophobic since I've gotten older.
[01:42:51.450 --> 01:42:53.892]  Wearing these damn masks pisses me off, freaks me out.
[01:42:53.892 --> 01:42:55.173]  I can't breathe well with them.
[01:42:55.173 --> 01:42:56.814]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:56.814 --> 01:42:59.456]  I totally agree with you, and I want to also tell the...
[01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:09.735]  The people that are perpetrating all this fraud and have been involved with all this treasonous activity, I want them to know that I'm a student of history.
[01:43:09.735 --> 01:43:15.599]  I grew up outside of Philadelphia, and there's a lot to know about our world history and our country's history.
[01:43:15.599 --> 01:43:19.162]  And people know what happened back in the 1770s.
[01:43:19.162 --> 01:43:23.845]  They know it to every day, every hour, every minute, from the diaries and the letters that were written.
[01:43:23.845 --> 01:43:25.246]  And they know every single person.
[01:43:25.686 --> 01:43:27.747]  And what they were doing and what they weren't doing.
[01:43:27.747 --> 01:43:36.570]  And a hundred years from now, the way things are on these computers that never goes away, everyone's going to know who you were, who you are, and what you've done.
[01:43:36.570 --> 01:43:44.333]  I agree, but as millions get cancer and millions get sterile, the Fauci's in people are going to be held accountable for murder, like Nazis at Nuremberg.
[01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:46.054]  God bless you.
[01:43:46.054 --> 01:43:48.635]  See, I said I'm not going to thank the callers, but I just can't help it.
[01:43:48.635 --> 01:43:52.317]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in South Carolina.
[01:43:52.317 --> 01:43:52.977]  Go ahead, welcome.
[01:43:54.724 --> 01:43:55.524]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:55.524 --> 01:43:56.245]  How are you?
[01:43:56.245 --> 01:43:56.685]  Good, brother.
[01:43:56.685 --> 01:43:58.726]  Go ahead.
[01:43:58.726 --> 01:44:04.189]  I think that it's time for our religious leaders to stand up, man, and reject all this.
[01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:12.713]  I go to these churches and they're taking people's temperatures and wearing masks and doing all this stuff.
[01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:19.396]  That's because the new religion is humans are dirty and their virtue is signaling and, oh, they're going to want to see your vaccine passport soon.
[01:44:19.396 --> 01:44:19.997]  Exactly.
[01:44:19.997 --> 01:44:21.177]  They're not churches.
[01:44:21.177 --> 01:44:22.678]  They're caught in the devil's net.
[01:44:25.428 --> 01:44:27.170]  It just blows my mind, Alex.
[01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:28.211]  I just can't understand it.
[01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:30.893]  And I want to thank you for waking me up, man.
[01:44:30.893 --> 01:44:34.817]  I know you get that all the time, but thank you, Alex.
[01:44:34.817 --> 01:44:35.858]  Well, thank you, Michael.
[01:44:35.858 --> 01:44:37.159]  I just want us to win together.
[01:44:37.159 --> 01:44:39.441]  That's why your word of mouth is king.
[01:44:39.441 --> 01:44:41.423]  A woman's word of mouth is queen.
[01:44:41.423 --> 01:44:47.828]  And just telling people about the show and sharing videos and sharing articles that Roger Stone Interview needs to get out to everybody.
[01:44:47.828 --> 01:44:48.649]  That's how we do it.
[01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:49.210]  God bless you.
[01:44:50.208 --> 01:44:51.389]  I guess we can all thank each other.
[01:44:51.389 --> 01:44:52.990]  I just, we spend a lot of time thanking each other.
[01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:55.152]  We don't get to the next caller, but yes, I love you too.
[01:44:55.152 --> 01:44:56.953]  Let's talk to John in Wyoming.
[01:44:56.953 --> 01:44:57.814]  John, thanks for holding.
[01:44:57.814 --> 01:44:58.875]  Go ahead.
[01:44:58.875 --> 01:45:00.276]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:45:00.276 --> 01:45:06.100]  Before I get to the vaccines, I want to touch upon what you mentioned earlier in the broadcast.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.244]  Remember when you were talking about those giant holograms of jellyfish?
[01:45:11.244 --> 01:45:12.064]  Yes.
[01:45:12.064 --> 01:45:15.427]  Look at the James Bond movie that Daniel Craig filmed.
[01:45:15.427 --> 01:45:16.848]  It was called Skyfall.
[01:45:17.389 --> 01:45:29.059]  When he was in this huge skyscraper in Hong Kong chasing the bad guy, and outside the windows they had these enormous jellyfish holograms.
[01:45:29.059 --> 01:45:35.324]  They were light green colored, and they looked as realistic as you depicted a while ago.
[01:45:35.324 --> 01:45:39.227]  But getting on to the vaccines, there are three important things to remember.
[01:45:39.227 --> 01:45:46.413]  That in early 1976, there was one suspected but never confirmed case of swine flu at Fort Dix, New Jersey.
[01:45:47.037 --> 01:45:57.283]  So the feds came up with a vaccine that cost the taxpayers $135 million and they started the swine flu vaccine March 24th of 76.
[01:45:57.283 --> 01:46:11.732]  They ended it October 12th of 76 because over 100 people had died from the deleterious effects and hundreds more were left either permanently paralyzed or deleteriously brain dead.
[01:46:12.253 --> 01:46:14.373]  from the effects of the vaccine.
[01:46:14.373 --> 01:46:17.094]  So then they quit on October 12th of 76.
[01:46:17.094 --> 01:46:37.238]  Years later, when George W. Bush was president, he issued on May 9th, 2007, Presidential Directive 51, which means if your whole family gets wiped out from the deleterious effects of any vaccine, you can't sue the pharmaceutical company.
[01:46:37.238 --> 01:46:39.018]  So this thing has been in the making.
[01:46:39.018 --> 01:46:41.879]  This thing has been in the planning for a long, long time.
[01:46:42.577 --> 01:46:49.902]  Then fast forward to around the 1980s, late 80s, early 90s.
[01:46:49.902 --> 01:46:57.227]  Johnny Carson, when he was still hosting the Tonight Show, had Dr. Robert Mendelson on as a guest.
[01:46:57.227 --> 01:47:05.073]  This man was a great medical doctor who didn't lie the way that Anthony Fauci has been all along.
[01:47:05.073 --> 01:47:07.735]  And he would answer all of Carson's questions.
[01:47:08.268 --> 01:47:11.369]  And Carson asked him, well, what about AIDS?
[01:47:11.369 --> 01:47:27.715]  He said AIDS was concocted at the Fort Detrick Army Lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1978 and was deliberately introduced into the African population through World Health Organization smallpox vaccinations.
[01:47:28.593 --> 01:47:30.455]  And you could hear a pin drop.
[01:47:30.455 --> 01:47:31.556]  Well, guess what?
[01:47:31.556 --> 01:47:37.441]  Shortly after the interview, they claimed that Dr. Mendelsohn died of a heart attack.
[01:47:37.441 --> 01:47:44.388]  He was 60 years old in perfect health, didn't smoke, didn't drink, didn't use drugs, no fat on him.
[01:47:44.388 --> 01:47:50.033]  The man looked 30 years old, and yet they claimed he died of a heart attack.
[01:47:50.342 --> 01:47:57.345]  And by the way, John, I remember seeing that interview like when YouTube came around like 50, 60 years ago and it's been removed.
[01:47:57.345 --> 01:48:01.667]  I couldn't find that Dr. Mendelsohn on Johnny Carson.
[01:48:01.667 --> 01:48:02.828]  Maybe it's been re-uploaded.
[01:48:02.828 --> 01:48:04.648]  If somebody's got it, re-upload it.
[01:48:04.648 --> 01:48:05.849]  Some people should download archives.
[01:48:05.849 --> 01:48:06.909]  They should save them.
[01:48:06.909 --> 01:48:09.911]  But absolutely, my dad knew a lot of people.
[01:48:10.891 --> 01:48:11.311]  I think?
[01:48:30.965 --> 01:48:34.869]  My dad did dental work on the CIA and stuff like that, to make a long story short.
[01:48:34.869 --> 01:48:38.313]  So, this has been known for a long, long time.
[01:48:38.313 --> 01:48:39.895]  It's absolutely true.
[01:48:39.895 --> 01:48:42.758]  And John, you've been calling in for like 15, 16 maybe.
[01:48:42.758 --> 01:48:43.839]  How long you been calling in, John?
[01:48:43.839 --> 01:48:45.861]  You haven't gotten on in years.
[01:48:45.861 --> 01:48:49.165]  Oh, it's, you know, since little orphan Annie had pupils in her eyes.
[01:48:49.855 --> 01:48:50.776]  All right, brother.
[01:48:50.776 --> 01:48:53.278]  I said I'm going to start that show years ago with our best callers.
[01:48:53.278 --> 01:48:55.880]  I never did it, but we finally have started doing it.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.021]  Give me your name and number again.
[01:48:57.021 --> 01:48:58.382]  I want to have you on as a guest.
[01:48:58.382 --> 01:48:58.722]  All right.
[01:48:58.722 --> 01:48:58.982]  Wow.
[01:48:58.982 --> 01:49:03.085]  That was an incredible caller and absolutely powerful info he put out.
[01:49:03.085 --> 01:49:05.187]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:49:05.187 --> 01:49:08.289]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dennis in Kentucky.
[01:49:08.289 --> 01:49:11.072]  Dennis, welcome.
[01:49:11.072 --> 01:49:12.313]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:12.313 --> 01:49:14.414]  First, I want to say this.
[01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:18.978]  If it's possible, could you please bring back Emmerich's Essential Organic Mouthwash?
[01:49:19.608 --> 01:49:21.068]  Yes, we're trying to do that.
[01:49:21.068 --> 01:49:23.829]  It's just some of these products are expensive and you got to warehouse them.
[01:49:23.829 --> 01:49:26.850]  But yes, we're going to bring back a lot of the Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:32.872]  The big company we're working with, private labeling that, the left found out who it was and threatened them.
[01:49:32.872 --> 01:49:37.333]  So we had to redo the whole Emmerich's Essentials line because during the deplatforming, they took that away from us.
[01:49:38.311 --> 01:49:40.712]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:49:40.712 --> 01:49:48.237]  Right now, I thoroughly believe Trump has woken up in so many people as far as America and its core values.
[01:49:48.237 --> 01:49:53.040]  Now it's time for real Americans to go and take in positions of government.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.623]  And as far as this whole COVID thing, you're absolutely right.
[01:49:57.623 --> 01:50:00.184]  They're telling you everything is absolutely correct.
[01:50:00.184 --> 01:50:06.268]  The deaths that they were projecting is not through the actual COVID, it's through their vaccinations.
[01:50:07.153 --> 01:50:10.256]  This is a modern Tuskegee experiment.
[01:50:10.256 --> 01:50:10.736]  You're right.
[01:50:10.736 --> 01:50:12.257]  It's a giant Tuskegee experiment.
[01:50:12.257 --> 01:50:14.119]  It's illegal, and it's violent.
[01:50:14.119 --> 01:50:15.800]  And them trying to, again, make us do it.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.562]  They try to make us take the shot.
[01:50:17.562 --> 01:50:21.746]  They try to make us comply, make us wear the mask, make us go along with it.
[01:50:21.746 --> 01:50:26.089]  No, we must start resisting and pointing out what it is.
[01:50:26.089 --> 01:50:26.630]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:26.630 --> 01:50:28.011]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:50:28.011 --> 01:50:31.013]  Once you understand that, you're absolutely correct.
[01:50:31.013 --> 01:50:32.475]  They're telling you.
[01:50:32.475 --> 01:50:33.736]  It's not the actual
[01:50:34.437 --> 01:50:36.578]  It's the virus that's going to kill you.
[01:50:36.578 --> 01:50:38.519]  It's the shot that's going to kill you.
[01:50:38.519 --> 01:50:41.681]  That's why everything is unraveling the way that it is.
[01:50:41.681 --> 01:50:43.262]  And you're right, is President Trump
[01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:45.786]  The best president we ever had?
[01:50:45.786 --> 01:50:47.208]  Yes he is.
[01:50:47.208 --> 01:50:48.149]  Does he have fault?
[01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:49.190]  Yes he does.
[01:50:49.190 --> 01:50:50.891]  Show me somebody who doesn't.
[01:50:50.891 --> 01:50:53.674]  Everybody's not going to get everything right all the time.
[01:50:53.674 --> 01:50:54.795]  It's just not possible.
[01:50:54.795 --> 01:50:59.940]  Well I know for a fact Trump said things are a lot worse than he thought they were and he just doesn't understand all this stuff.
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.602]  He's getting educated now.
[01:51:01.602 --> 01:51:04.265]  He knew they were trying to keep things locked down by saying there wasn't a vaccine.
[01:51:04.625 --> 01:51:05.466]  He thought he'd bring it out.
[01:51:05.466 --> 01:51:07.328]  Remember he said, you don't have to take it.
[01:51:07.328 --> 01:51:08.089]  Only old people need it.
[01:51:08.089 --> 01:51:08.670]  Remember all that?
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:10.111]  But it got away from him.
[01:51:10.111 --> 01:51:12.313]  And then it was a fight over who would control the vaccine.
[01:51:12.313 --> 01:51:15.317]  And they said, oh, don't take Trump's vaccine, take ours.
[01:51:15.317 --> 01:51:16.558]  So it's all a giant mess.
[01:51:16.558 --> 01:51:18.520]  Regardless, he won the election.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:19.561]  They're trying to steal it.
[01:51:19.561 --> 01:51:20.522]  I back President Trump.
[01:51:21.363 --> 01:51:23.887]  Those that don't back Trump are with Biden and the globalists.
[01:51:23.887 --> 01:51:27.672]  They want to act like, oh, they're holier than thou, but no, they're with Biden, they're with the globalists.
[01:51:27.672 --> 01:51:28.613]  Thank you so much, Dennis.
[01:51:28.613 --> 01:51:29.755]  God bless you.
[01:51:29.755 --> 01:51:35.843]  And again, I say attack Trump where he's wrong, but the point is, they're trying to steal this election, and Biden's going to be a hundred times worse.
[01:51:35.843 --> 01:51:38.046]  We'll be right back with more calls and then a special guest.
[01:51:40.316 --> 01:51:43.439]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[01:51:43.439 --> 01:51:47.723]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[01:51:47.723 --> 01:51:57.172]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[01:51:57.172 --> 01:51:57.773]  They are going to explode.
[01:51:57.793 --> 01:51:58.033]  I think?
[01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:24.310]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:26.191]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[01:52:26.191 --> 01:52:27.533]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[01:52:27.533 --> 01:52:30.435]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[01:52:30.435 --> 01:52:31.817]  That's what social distancing is.
[01:52:31.817 --> 01:52:35.520]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.682]  No small businesses will be there.
[01:52:37.682 --> 01:52:38.883]  This is a master plan.
[01:52:38.883 --> 01:52:39.223]  Say no!
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:57.090]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:58.150]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[01:52:59.171 --> 01:53:03.115]  Global government, the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[01:53:03.115 --> 01:53:10.642]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[01:53:10.642 --> 01:53:13.045]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[01:53:13.045 --> 01:53:14.426]  Think about how insane that is.
[01:53:14.426 --> 01:53:16.388]  Oh, big tech's got to track you.
[01:53:16.388 --> 01:53:17.049]  They've got to trace you.
[01:53:17.049 --> 01:53:18.370]  They've got to control you.
[01:53:18.370 --> 01:53:20.112]  You've got to have apps leave your house.
[01:53:20.112 --> 01:53:23.275]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[01:53:23.975 --> 01:53:30.757]  My God, this thing has one-tenth of one percent chance of killing you if you're debilitated by cancer or a heart attack.
[01:53:30.757 --> 01:53:32.397]  This is their takeover.
[01:53:32.397 --> 01:53:34.737]  Imagine on America's death certificate.
[01:53:34.737 --> 01:53:37.258]  Killed by the fear of the common cold.
[01:53:37.258 --> 01:53:38.358]  Yeah, that's fear-mongering.
[01:53:38.358 --> 01:53:43.859]  That's mind control.
[01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:46.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:55.104 --> 01:54:15.064]  Technical support in terms of being able to make their digital piece work, and it was great to see them Great to see them work so close together, but it's just an example I think faith communities in general have had many of the same.
[01:54:15.064 --> 01:54:18.087]  I followed Why was my tag run?
[01:54:19.889 --> 01:54:21.371]  Did I break the law?
[01:54:21.371 --> 01:54:22.591]  Then why are you here?
[01:54:22.591 --> 01:54:29.997]  I want to know why my tag was run.
[01:54:29.997 --> 01:54:34.200]  Did I break the law?
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.841]  Did I break the law?
[01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:38.943]  You know I didn't break the law because the other cop said I didn't.
[01:54:38.943 --> 01:54:40.705]  So you're just harassing me.
[01:54:40.705 --> 01:54:42.326]  You chose to harass me.
[01:54:42.326 --> 01:54:46.069]  The other cop walked up to me and said, you did nothing wrong.
[01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:47.089]  There's no problem.
[01:54:48.188 --> 01:54:51.531]  But you chose to run my tag.
[01:54:51.531 --> 01:54:58.397]  I told you my side of the story there, but you chose to run my tag.
[01:54:58.397 --> 01:55:01.260]  It doesn't matter what I have.
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:04.263]  It's not a law that people are required to wear a mask.
[01:55:04.263 --> 01:55:05.764]  Yes or no.
[01:55:05.764 --> 01:55:07.045]  It's a law.
[01:55:07.045 --> 01:55:07.866]  It's a law.
[01:55:07.866 --> 01:55:11.029]  You're telling me it's a law.
[01:55:11.029 --> 01:55:12.410]  You're telling me it's a law.
[01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:13.211]  I got to record it.
[01:55:13.211 --> 01:55:14.072]  You said it was a law.
[01:55:15.643 --> 01:55:23.914]  Ladies and gentlemen, you notice that they said the masks are never coming off now, but Governor Abbott here in Texas told Austin, you can't lock the city down and have curfews.
[01:55:23.914 --> 01:55:25.716]  It's not a law, it's not a governor's order.
[01:55:25.716 --> 01:55:27.859]  Well, even the governor's order is crap.
[01:55:27.859 --> 01:55:28.801]  I say he doesn't have that power.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.601]  They say I'm not essential.
[01:55:31.601 --> 01:55:35.945]  But his mandate supposedly was going to end on the 28th.
[01:55:35.945 --> 01:55:39.888]  I've been looking to see if the Texas jubilatorial order has been reissued.
[01:55:39.888 --> 01:55:41.349]  I didn't find it this morning.
[01:55:41.349 --> 01:55:42.610]  I just asked the crew to look again.
[01:55:42.610 --> 01:55:45.813]  But regardless, it's all kabuki theater.
[01:55:45.813 --> 01:55:55.401]  So we'll be talking about that with constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who's been at the tip of the spear exposing these lockdowns, the statistical fraud, and the rest of it.
[01:55:55.401 --> 01:55:58.063]  I'm going to ask him, where do we go?
[01:55:58.063 --> 01:55:58.803]  What do we do?
[01:55:59.861 --> 01:56:02.143]  To counter all this illegality.
[01:56:02.143 --> 01:56:03.504]  And China's open.
[01:56:03.504 --> 01:56:04.665]  They've got their businesses going.
[01:56:04.665 --> 01:56:07.567]  They're advertising that America's never going to reopen.
[01:56:07.567 --> 01:56:08.768]  They say, oh, invest here.
[01:56:08.768 --> 01:56:10.089]  And the globalists are all invested there.
[01:56:10.089 --> 01:56:13.131]  That's why the Democrats as a class want the lockdown to continue.
[01:56:13.131 --> 01:56:13.932]  Look at big tech.
[01:56:13.932 --> 01:56:16.754]  Look at how they doubled their profits on average.
[01:56:16.754 --> 01:56:19.716]  My God, Jeff Bezos doubled his wealth during all of this.
[01:56:19.716 --> 01:56:24.000]  Google, Apple, they're all exploding because they're vertically integrating us.
[01:56:25.282 --> 01:56:33.977]  This is the greatest crimes against humanity since the fascists and against the communists and all the things they did to civilization.
[01:56:33.977 --> 01:56:37.002]  It's simply an insane time to be alive.
[01:56:37.002 --> 01:56:38.083]  But first we'll talk about
[01:56:39.448 --> 01:56:42.489]  What's going to happen on the 6th in the Senate, in the House?
[01:56:42.489 --> 01:56:47.830]  Does Trump still have a path to victory with all this new election fraud evidence coming out?
[01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:52.911]  Trump has cut off his Mar-a-Lago visit early and has gone back to D.C.
[01:56:52.911 --> 01:56:55.131]  I'm told a lot of stuff is afoot.
[01:56:55.131 --> 01:56:58.452]  Barnes has been at the request of the President doing work as well.
[01:56:58.452 --> 01:57:00.032]  He will join us in the next segment.
[01:57:00.032 --> 01:57:02.192]  Let's jam in one more call right now though.
[01:57:02.192 --> 01:57:02.993]  Tim in Washington.
[01:57:02.993 --> 01:57:04.253]  You got about a minute and a half.
[01:57:04.253 --> 01:57:04.553]  Welcome.
[01:57:06.856 --> 01:57:07.877]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[01:57:07.877 --> 01:57:08.938]  Happy New Year, America.
[01:57:08.938 --> 01:57:11.220]  Happy New Year, the world.
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:20.349]  The things that I'm going to do in 2021 is that I'm going to encourage Americans, free Americans, to get outside and make the resistance the new culture.
[01:57:20.349 --> 01:57:22.131]  That's what needs to happen.
[01:57:22.131 --> 01:57:27.476]  We can't be tied in our homes anymore and waiting for leadership to never show up.
[01:57:27.476 --> 01:57:28.617]  And they never show up.
[01:57:28.617 --> 01:57:31.800]  I mean, and they will bend to the will of the people who will make them.
[01:57:32.737 --> 01:57:44.046]  Also, I'd like to invite you to the Gates Foundation, because every Saturday I bullhorn your latest videos, Bill Bigtree's latest videos, Dr. Francis Boyle's latest videos, at the Gates Foundation for about three or four hours.
[01:57:44.046 --> 01:57:48.889]  I'd like, hopefully, either you or Bill to show up.
[01:57:48.889 --> 01:57:51.551]  Is that in Washington State?
[01:57:51.551 --> 01:57:52.512]  It is, in Seattle.
[01:57:52.512 --> 01:57:54.053]  It's in Mercer.
[01:57:54.053 --> 01:57:56.835]  Do me a favor, guys, get his name and number.
[01:57:56.835 --> 01:57:58.416]  I'd like to have this guy on as a guest.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:05.742]  I want to get this fellow on as a guest, maybe on the Sunday show.
[01:58:05.742 --> 01:58:07.123]  Send us some of your videos.
[01:58:07.123 --> 01:58:10.585]  I know that there are demonstrations against Gates.
[01:58:10.585 --> 01:58:11.325]  I know that he hates it.
[01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:12.106]  I know that's a good thing.
[01:58:12.106 --> 01:58:13.867]  I think I've probably seen some of your videos then.
[01:58:13.867 --> 01:58:19.450]  So I'm going to put you on hold with my producer, and they're going to try to set you up for a segment on the Sunday show.
[01:58:19.450 --> 01:58:21.091]  Does that work, Tim?
[01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:21.591]  Yeah, it does.
[01:58:21.591 --> 01:58:26.094]  I just have two other things to really talk about, and then I'd love to be on your show and encourage listeners.
[01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:27.780]  Well, Tim, let's do this.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.861]  We've got to go to break.
[01:58:28.861 --> 01:58:30.382]  I've got Robert Barnes coming up.
[01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:31.783]  So, I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:58:31.783 --> 01:58:33.945]  We'll set you up for Sunday for a whole segment.
[01:58:33.945 --> 01:58:36.167]  Show some clips of what you do and have you on as a guest.
[01:58:36.167 --> 01:58:36.507]  I agree.
[01:58:36.507 --> 01:58:38.368]  Resistance culture is the answer.
[01:58:38.368 --> 01:58:40.951]  Resistance culture is the answer.
[01:58:40.951 --> 01:58:44.333]  Being defiant to tyranny and not complying, not submitting.
[01:58:44.333 --> 01:58:44.814]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:48.985 --> 01:58:53.667]  Fight for Trump on January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:53.667 --> 01:59:00.509]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[01:59:00.509 --> 01:59:02.009]  It's 1776 time!
[01:59:02.009 --> 01:59:12.893]  On November 14th, hundreds of thousands of American patriots gathered in the nation's capital to stop the biggest election steal in American history.
[01:59:12.893 --> 01:59:15.873]  America is going under leftist martial law!
[01:59:15.873 --> 01:59:17.534]  And the Communist Chinese agent
[01:59:19.062 --> 01:59:20.223]  We will never give in.
[01:59:20.223 --> 01:59:23.686]  We will never give up and we will never back down.
[01:59:23.686 --> 01:59:27.109]  We will never, ever surrender.
[02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.168]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.168 --> 02:00:03.970]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:03.970 --> 02:00:05.852]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:05.852 --> 02:00:07.574]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:07.574 --> 02:00:09.216]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.216 --> 02:00:13.921]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.067 --> 02:00:20.134]  It's the first broadcast of the Alex Jones Show in the year 2021.
[02:00:20.134 --> 02:00:23.038]  I remember as a little kid thinking about 2020 being a big year.
[02:00:25.836 --> 02:00:26.216]  All right.
[02:00:48.049 --> 02:00:53.153]  Parliamentary system of our Constitution that is the marble of the world.
[02:00:53.153 --> 02:00:54.154]  The checks and balances.
[02:00:54.154 --> 02:00:56.876]  The Democrats act like it's bad to question votes.
[02:00:56.876 --> 02:00:59.738]  They act like it's bad to have electors.
[02:00:59.738 --> 02:01:02.600]  Act like it's bad to have Senate and House checks and balances.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:05.422]  But Trump's up against a lot of odds.
[02:01:05.422 --> 02:01:06.963]  A lot of swamp cowards.
[02:01:06.963 --> 02:01:11.086]  Republicans that want to parlay power and don't want Trump there blocking their lobbyists.
[02:01:11.086 --> 02:01:12.147]  So it's an uphill battle.
[02:01:12.147 --> 02:01:12.888]  Pence has come back.
[02:01:14.428 --> 02:01:17.052]  He was going to go to a European and Israeli vacation.
[02:01:17.052 --> 02:01:18.415]  Now he's going to be here on the 6th.
[02:01:18.415 --> 02:01:21.921]  Though he's fighting lawsuits by Congressman Gohmert of Texas to try to make him.
[02:01:23.007 --> 02:01:24.107]  Not certify this.
[02:01:24.107 --> 02:01:26.928]  Josh Hawley has come out and said he's going to do it.
[02:01:26.928 --> 02:01:29.508]  We need a second senator to go through that.
[02:01:29.508 --> 02:01:32.829]  We've got over 140 House members, we're told, that are going to try to block things.
[02:01:32.829 --> 02:01:43.131]  So to go over the math, the numbers, the facts, and the long shot Hail Mary, if it's still there, is Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer and good friend of mine.
[02:01:43.131 --> 02:01:45.192]  Robert, thanks for coming on during the first of the year here.
[02:01:46.912 --> 02:01:48.233]  Glad to be here.
[02:01:48.233 --> 02:01:56.460]  So let's tackle the best numbers, the best path to victory, the latest election fraud, what's really going on and what we can expect to happen on the 6th so far.
[02:01:57.782 --> 02:02:05.310]  So there's no doubt objections will be made and they will have to conduct hearings because of Senator Hawley.
[02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:14.020]  Under the Electoral Count Act, all there has to be is one senator to join the objections for the House and the Senate to have to vote on those objections.
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:16.703]  And they're supposed to conduct two hours of debate.
[02:02:17.273 --> 02:02:24.199]  The President's team has requested that they be afforded some opportunity to present argument before Congress.
[02:02:24.199 --> 02:02:36.609]  That has not yet been granted, so it may be up to the Congress members and Senators themselves to state the nature of the objections and to explain the evidentiary foundation for those objections.
[02:02:36.609 --> 02:02:38.611]  But there's no doubt objections will be made.
[02:02:38.611 --> 02:02:40.633]  The question is only now how many states?
[02:02:41.529 --> 02:02:50.732]  The hope is that at least seven state electors will be objected to based on constitutional issues with the nature of those elections in those states.
[02:02:50.732 --> 02:02:54.434]  The first state up to object to will be Arizona.
[02:02:54.434 --> 02:03:01.056]  After that, there's Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and potentially New Mexico.
[02:03:01.741 --> 02:03:08.923]  And so the hope is that there will be meaningful hearings, meaningful evidence presented, and then it will be up to two main actors.
[02:03:08.923 --> 02:03:14.485]  One is, what happens is the House and the Senate go and debate it separately for two hours.
[02:03:14.485 --> 02:03:16.006]  They don't debate it together.
[02:03:16.006 --> 02:03:23.848]  So after the Senate and the House, a Senator and House member object, any electors from any state, per electors, they go and debate for two hours.
[02:03:24.412 --> 02:03:32.438]  So potentially, so that can be up to, theoretically can be up to 100 hours or 102 hours if every single state's electors were objected to.
[02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:37.702]  But the assumption right now is that about seven states they're looking to object to.
[02:03:37.702 --> 02:03:43.767]  They'll go and form in their own chambers, debate the objection for two hours, then come back and vote.
[02:03:43.767 --> 02:03:45.869]  And they vote as separate chambers.
[02:03:45.869 --> 02:03:49.592]  And here, another key participant will be Vice President Pence.
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:55.744]  Vice President Pence could decide to say that there are competing electors from some of these states.
[02:03:55.744 --> 02:04:14.359]  Vice President Pence, under the 12th Amendment, could say that certain electors he refuses to certify due to constitutional questions about how the election was conducted in those states, due to the lack of transparency, the lack of audits, the lack of signature match checks that took place in all of these states, despite multiple and myriad requests for that to occur.
[02:04:15.389 --> 02:04:17.550]  So it'll be, how does the House vote?
[02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:18.631]  How does the Senate vote?
[02:04:18.631 --> 02:04:20.051]  And how does the Vice President act?
[02:04:20.051 --> 02:04:26.174]  Because how the Vice President acts can have an impact on which vote matters from the House or the Senate.
[02:04:26.174 --> 02:04:35.718]  So all of those are basically in play and the question is, what do House members and Senators do when presented with argument and evidence about these individual states' electors?
[02:04:35.718 --> 02:04:40.480]  Do they uphold an unconstitutional election or do they contest that unconstitutional election?
[02:04:41.195 --> 02:04:47.880]  If Biden ends up with fewer than 260 electoral votes at the end of this process,
[02:04:48.979 --> 02:04:57.422]  Then under the 12th Amendment, the election goes to the House of Representatives to vote by state delegation, not by individual members, but by state delegation.
[02:04:57.422 --> 02:04:59.742]  So and then that heavily favors Trump.
[02:04:59.742 --> 02:05:04.404]  So the big question, the first big question was would a senator join the objections?
[02:05:04.404 --> 02:05:07.445]  We now know from Senator Hawley that will happen.
[02:05:07.445 --> 02:05:09.766]  That means these votes have to take place.
[02:05:09.766 --> 02:05:12.006]  That means these hearings have to take place.
[02:05:12.006 --> 02:05:16.988]  And that gives the president, while a long shot, a shot to have a constitutionally correct
[02:05:17.646 --> 02:05:21.228]  Uh, response take place to this unconstitutional election.
[02:05:21.228 --> 02:05:24.349]  What can we, the people, do to put pressure?
[02:05:24.349 --> 02:05:25.190]  Obviously, March.
[02:05:25.190 --> 02:05:27.451]  What else?
[02:05:27.451 --> 02:05:31.993]  Uh, you know, for everybody to go to the reason why the president has requested everybody go to D.C.
[02:05:31.993 --> 02:05:37.436]  that can on January 6th is for Congress to witness the public pressure.
[02:05:37.436 --> 02:05:46.080]  For those who cannot do so, either for a matter of means or other reasons, then the other option is to put pressure on every senator and House member there is.
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:06:03.998]  Call them, email them, fax them, mail them, whatever you can do to let them know your opinion, that they should vote to oppose and object to these electors, and that they should not certify an election that cannot be constitutionally certified as being consistent to the Constitution.
[02:06:04.674 --> 02:06:17.609]  And that is the case in many states, but clearly the states where it was very close, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia, but also is present in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, to some extent New Mexico, and other states.
[02:06:17.609 --> 02:06:21.313]  So the public can put continuous pressure on him because that's what's worked so far.
[02:06:21.813 --> 02:06:30.641]  That's what got Senator Hawley to admit and confess and to say he will in fact express his intent to object was because of the public pressure.
[02:06:30.641 --> 02:06:39.710]  The more they realize that Trump's base will not support them in the future if they do not fight for Trump, no one's going to come fight for them.
[02:06:39.710 --> 02:06:45.495]  That is what gives Trump the best chance to have a meaningful hearing, to have the most objections to the most electors.
[02:06:45.495 --> 02:06:45.835]  That's right.
[02:06:48.757 --> 02:06:51.539]  Oh, and just have the best chance of getting the most votes.
[02:06:51.539 --> 02:06:54.862]  Well, you certainly called Amy Comey Barrett.
[02:06:54.862 --> 02:06:59.165]  You certainly called Mitch McConnell.
[02:06:59.165 --> 02:07:04.750]  But they really seem freaked out now as more election fraud evidence mounts and as the public doesn't buy into this.
[02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:07.112]  This is really a constitutional crisis.
[02:07:08.939 --> 02:07:13.943]  No question, because it's an election that did not take place in a manner consistent to the constitutional requirement.
[02:07:13.943 --> 02:07:18.427]  The Electors Clause requires the state legislature to choose the method by which an election is conducted.
[02:07:18.427 --> 02:07:19.949]  That did not happen here.
[02:07:19.949 --> 02:07:22.711]  And it's acknowledged and admitted that that did not happen here.
[02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:24.433]  And the only debate has always been remedy.
[02:07:24.913 --> 02:07:27.495]  And the courts have basically said they're closed.
[02:07:27.495 --> 02:07:28.656]  They're not going to give remedy.
[02:07:28.656 --> 02:07:30.677]  There's been no evidentiary.
[02:07:30.677 --> 02:07:35.740]  Senator Sasse was out there being critical, and he was citing the New York Times and other people.
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:42.325]  There's been no evidentiary investigation by any law enforcement body of any meaningful quality into whether fraud occurred in this election.
[02:07:42.805 --> 02:07:48.348]  And the big fraud is a fraud that's not really in controversy, which is the fraud on the Constitution.
[02:07:48.348 --> 02:08:01.176]  The fraud by having the election conducted in a manner directly contrary to the dictates of the Elector's Clause, which was, as the Supreme Court admitted just two years ago, the most critically debated item in the entire Constitution.
[02:08:01.176 --> 02:08:02.717]  Let's expand on this.
[02:08:02.717 --> 02:08:03.898]  Let's expand on this when we come back.
[02:08:03.898 --> 02:08:06.720]  The legislatures did not pick the president in this election.
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:10.662]  The legislatures have been cut out of this, which is really a giant power grab.
[02:08:12.648 --> 02:08:13.028]  Completely.
[02:08:13.028 --> 02:08:19.751]  The biggest problem the Democrats had was that in all of these key swing states, they didn't control the state legislatures.
[02:08:19.751 --> 02:08:22.872]  So constitutionally, they couldn't change the rules, yet they still did.
[02:08:22.872 --> 02:08:35.116]  And they did by getting often secret deals, backroom deals, with a bunch of executive officials who they did have influence and control over, even when they were nominally Republican, to change the rules of the election.
[02:08:35.116 --> 02:08:36.997]  So this is really a...
[02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:42.242]  Power grabbed by the executive and by lawyers and by bureaucracies.
[02:08:42.242 --> 02:08:46.524]  And obviously these Republican leaders like the Governor of Georgia, we find out, are on the Chai Com Payroll.
[02:08:46.524 --> 02:08:48.045]  Mitch is on the Chai Com Payroll.
[02:08:48.045 --> 02:08:53.227]  We're now discovering, which we already knew, but the public is, it's not just the Democrats on the Chinese Communist tit.
[02:08:54.963 --> 02:09:00.165]  Well, I mean, it was with key Republican support that all of our jobs got shipped to China in the first place.
[02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:03.006]  So, I mean, Mitch McConnell was neck deep in that.
[02:09:03.006 --> 02:09:06.187]  The Bush family was neck deep in that.
[02:09:06.187 --> 02:09:15.311]  So the betrayal of America for China that's been happening for two decades now was led as much by key Republican establishment leaders as it was Democrats.
[02:09:15.311 --> 02:09:17.752]  So it should come as no surprise that they would betray Trump.
[02:09:18.372 --> 02:09:24.280]  Uh, at this key juncture, especially given that China is the main country that would benefit from a Biden presidency.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:32.831]  That's right, and it's the one that the globalists, both Republican and Democrat, are using as their command base to sell out America to, and where there's no laws except tyranny where they get away with it.
[02:09:33.211 --> 02:09:39.475]  And so I've got a plan, a talking point that's based in total reality, that will defeat them, which is making it all about China.
[02:09:39.475 --> 02:09:47.440]  Get the Chinese Communists out of both parties, go after them all, expose the depression, the shutdown is there to aid China, and really just defeat them.
[02:09:50.201 --> 02:09:50.921]  It's back in stock.
[02:09:50.921 --> 02:09:52.402]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[02:09:52.402 --> 02:09:55.483]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[02:09:55.483 --> 02:09:56.823]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[02:09:56.823 --> 02:10:00.905]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[02:10:00.905 --> 02:10:06.907]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[02:10:06.907 --> 02:10:08.067]  It's amazing.
[02:10:08.067 --> 02:10:09.528]  Folks absolutely love it.
[02:10:09.528 --> 02:10:12.449]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[02:10:12.449 --> 02:10:14.810]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:17.290]  25% off at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:18.151]  Pollen block again.
[02:10:18.991 --> 02:10:21.032]  It's available in this one-minute ad.
[02:10:21.032 --> 02:10:32.095]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[02:10:32.095 --> 02:10:33.696]  This is naturally occurring.
[02:10:33.696 --> 02:10:40.518]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress, and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[02:10:40.518 --> 02:10:41.438]  You chew up the pills.
[02:10:41.438 --> 02:10:42.298]  They taste great.
[02:10:42.298 --> 02:10:43.519]  It's available again.
[02:10:43.519 --> 02:10:44.979]  M4WarStore.com.
[02:10:44.979 --> 02:10:45.399]  Hollablock.

[02:11:50.834 --> 02:12:05.818]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:05.818 --> 02:12:07.939]  Alright, Robert Barnes was asked by Trump directly.
[02:12:07.939 --> 02:12:09.839]  He's done it.
[02:12:09.839 --> 02:12:12.920]  For the Republic, basically free of charge to race around the country and investigate.
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.761]  And he's been there.
[02:12:14.761 --> 02:12:18.682]  And I'm not trying to put down Lin Wood or Powell or any of these people.
[02:12:20.009 --> 02:12:22.471]  But we've seen Fishers with Giuliani in them.
[02:12:22.471 --> 02:12:25.092]  So I don't want to get into infighting.
[02:12:25.092 --> 02:12:26.073]  Where's the real fraud?
[02:12:26.073 --> 02:12:28.255]  I mean, we know there's a lot of it.
[02:12:28.255 --> 02:12:30.676]  What's the best place to overturn these elections?
[02:12:30.676 --> 02:12:32.578]  I think it's what you just said.
[02:12:32.578 --> 02:12:35.039]  The legislature's never passed this on its face.
[02:12:35.039 --> 02:12:40.083]  It should be easy for the Supreme Court, easy for Congress, easy for the legislature to take over.
[02:12:40.083 --> 02:12:41.023]  How do we do that?
[02:12:41.023 --> 02:12:41.964]  Well, we put pressure on them.
[02:12:41.964 --> 02:12:44.346]  We've seen some movement, but then you see
[02:12:45.512 --> 02:12:52.816]  The Kraken and you know others keep talking about all this other things that there is some evidence of obviously electronic manipulation.
[02:12:52.816 --> 02:13:09.545]  The problem is how do you quantify that for courts in the time we've got and then now we've got Lin Wood saying Jeffrey Epstein is still alive going after John Roberts for which I have seen evidence of him being blackmailed and obviously some weirdness with how he adopted his children but some incredibly bold stuff by Lin Wood.
[02:13:10.618 --> 02:13:11.739]  Is Twitter scared of him?
[02:13:11.739 --> 02:13:16.561]  Because if I put something out one-tenth as extreme, I was banned.
[02:13:16.561 --> 02:13:20.824]  So I'm just wondering what's really going on with Lin Wood in your view?
[02:13:20.824 --> 02:13:27.367]  Well, I think Lin Wood is doing a lot of damage to the President's case, particularly in Congress, where he needs votes.
[02:13:27.367 --> 02:13:30.109]  He needs votes out of House members and Senators.
[02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:39.674]  And I think the reason why the media has been happy to let him go wild, and why Twitter hasn't censored him at all, is because they see them as helping Democrats and hurting Trump.
[02:13:40.194 --> 02:13:53.499]  I think he thinks he's helping Trump, but in fact he's not, because he's pursuing allegations that either cannot be proven at this stage or within this time frame, or allegations that distract from the core issues that can be proven.
[02:13:53.499 --> 02:14:00.842]  And frankly, Wood has been involved with a lot of the QAnon types who believe a lot of stuff that just has not been proven true.
[02:14:00.842 --> 02:14:05.164]  And that's a key problem, and unfortunately Sidney Powell got entrapped by a lot of that.
[02:14:05.991 --> 02:14:10.393]  The machines was never a productive focal point.
[02:14:10.393 --> 02:14:12.214]  And the President saw that early on.
[02:14:12.214 --> 02:14:17.516]  The signature matches, they stuffed the ballots the old-fashioned way.
[02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:21.538]  They weren't going to depend on machines to do what they did in this election.
[02:14:21.538 --> 02:14:23.939]  That's the reason why they did all these secret backroom deals.
[02:14:23.939 --> 02:14:27.300]  That was the point of the $80 million was to flood all that and be able to do it.
[02:14:28.354 --> 02:14:28.874]  Exactly.
[02:14:28.874 --> 02:14:29.655]  Flood the ballots.
[02:14:29.655 --> 02:14:31.516]  Just pour ballots out everywhere.
[02:14:31.516 --> 02:14:34.577]  Send them out everywhere so they would come back from everywhere.
[02:14:34.577 --> 02:14:37.719]  And we know that people that were not qualified to vote, voted.
[02:14:37.719 --> 02:14:44.702]  We know that the vote count was not done in a constitutional manner because monitors were not allowed to be present in many key counties in many key states.
[02:14:44.702 --> 02:14:52.646]  And most importantly, we know the signatures don't match because they've never allowed any independent confirmation of the signature match process to occur.
[02:14:52.646 --> 02:14:54.947]  And a lot of the arguments that we've been presenting to the senators
[02:14:55.507 --> 02:15:00.012]  That Senator Hawley understood was the combination of this is an electors clause issue.
[02:15:00.012 --> 02:15:01.934]  Was this a constitutional election?
[02:15:01.934 --> 02:15:09.201]  If it wasn't, then it's up to Congress to have the House vote by state delegation when we have a contested presidential election under the 12th Amendment.
[02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:16.649]  And second, the major area of fraud was the massive lack of safeguards being instituted for mail-in balloting.
[02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:24.535]  Because when you dig into the data, there's not a big difference between counties that have Dominion machines and don't have Dominion machines.
[02:15:24.535 --> 02:15:30.299]  Where there is a big difference is counties that had massive mail-in balloting surges and those that didn't.
[02:15:30.299 --> 02:15:34.883]  That's where it looks like the ballot box was padded with questionable ballots.
[02:15:34.883 --> 02:15:39.046]  And there, the only court that has allowed any form of signature match check to occur
[02:15:39.733 --> 02:15:51.522]  Did so in Arizona and they found that the Democrats own expert found that 11% of the signatures did not match, which means that's you put that out throughout the whole state of Arizona.
[02:15:51.522 --> 02:15:54.945]  That's 30 times more than the margin of victory.
[02:15:55.405 --> 02:16:09.539]  So the biggest issue for Trump all the way through that he could have on January 6th is first, this election was done in violation of the Electors Clause, which makes it unconstitutional, which makes the constitutional remedy voting by state delegation in the House, and then second,
[02:16:11.921 --> 02:16:28.814]  That the election had a lot of illegal ballots cast, not only by people who weren't qualified to vote because they were outside of the state, they were non-residents, they were non-citizens, or in some cases they were dead, but also because critically, and there was no monitored count of the vote that took place, that's deeply problematic.
[02:16:28.814 --> 02:16:32.437]  But the big one has always been the signatures just don't match.
[02:16:32.437 --> 02:16:36.040]  The one time they allowed us to take a look at it, the Democrats' own expert,
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:39.202]  Admitted that 11% of the signatures don't match.
[02:16:39.202 --> 02:16:42.904]  That's far bigger than the margin of victory in all of these states.
[02:16:42.904 --> 02:16:49.808]  And that means the remedy is to go to vote to the House by state delegation where the president has a six-state edge.
[02:16:49.808 --> 02:16:52.650]  And quantify that for people that aren't a constitutional lawyer.
[02:16:52.650 --> 02:16:56.793]  How that would happen if the House and Senate voted to do that.
[02:16:56.793 --> 02:16:57.833]  What the states would then do.
[02:16:57.833 --> 02:16:58.594]  What that would look like.
[02:16:59.997 --> 02:17:13.507]  So what would happen is if Joe Biden does not reach 270 electoral votes that are uncontested and that have not yet been certified, then the remedy under the 12th Amendment is to go to the House.
[02:17:13.507 --> 02:17:24.935]  Now, there is an interpretation of the 12th Amendment that Vice President Pence can do this all by himself, that he can say there's a contest involving too many states, so there's not enough.
[02:17:24.935 --> 02:17:26.576]  Neither candidate has more than 270 electoral votes.
[02:17:28.382 --> 02:17:31.924]  So under the 12th Amendment, the House must vote now by state delegation.
[02:17:31.924 --> 02:17:32.764]  So all that.
[02:17:32.764 --> 02:17:34.865]  And in some houses, you have a tie.
[02:17:34.865 --> 02:17:37.307]  So the vote probably wouldn't count.
[02:17:37.307 --> 02:17:43.350]  But it's the newly seated House, not the old House, but the newly seated House that would vote.
[02:17:43.350 --> 02:17:44.530]  They would vote by state.
[02:17:44.530 --> 02:17:47.892]  And whoever gets 26 states to vote for them wins.
[02:17:48.865 --> 02:17:53.470]  Or if it's 25 and 23 and 2 are tied, they win.
[02:17:53.470 --> 02:17:57.095]  So the president has an edge with 27 states.
[02:17:57.095 --> 02:18:01.441]  Wow, and so this makes the Georgia election also more important than ever.
[02:18:02.642 --> 02:18:05.305]  Yes, that's why Trump has been pursuing it.
[02:18:05.305 --> 02:18:12.453]  He knows he needs those Republican Senators to have a chance to get to the House delegation in the first place.
[02:18:12.453 --> 02:18:23.165]  Because if he doesn't win at least the Senate contesting the election, he needs... Let's say Vice President Pence comes in and says, I can't certify electors from these states.
[02:18:23.763 --> 02:18:31.709]  The House and the Senate could object to his decision, and as long as one of the two chambers went with Trump, then those votes would not count.
[02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:32.809]  What happens then?
[02:18:32.809 --> 02:18:37.393]  I mean, what procedurally does it go back to the states, and then they have re-elections there?
[02:18:37.393 --> 02:18:39.634]  They have new elections?
[02:18:39.634 --> 02:18:45.518]  No, it goes, the ultimate remedy is it always goes to the House to vote by state delegation under the 12th Amendment.
[02:18:45.518 --> 02:18:47.820]  And then they'll just decide which way those states really went?
[02:18:49.339 --> 02:18:49.819]  Exactly.
[02:18:49.819 --> 02:18:52.980]  And it's the people who they voted in.
[02:18:52.980 --> 02:19:00.882]  So when we vote our House members each year, we're giving them the power to choose a president if the election is contested.
[02:19:00.882 --> 02:19:02.783]  I understand that path.
[02:19:02.783 --> 02:19:11.085]  I'm saying, is there not another way so they don't claim Trump overturned the election as a dictator for the ignorant people out there to say we're going to have a new election?
[02:19:11.085 --> 02:19:11.685]  Because even the U.N.
[02:19:11.685 --> 02:19:12.425]  and the State Department
[02:19:12.765 --> 02:19:16.212]  Say, if there's not poll watchers, if there's big questions, you should redo.
[02:19:16.212 --> 02:19:17.674]  That's the international standard.
[02:19:17.674 --> 02:19:19.097]  That's the American standard.
[02:19:19.097 --> 02:19:21.682]  We don't normally have to redo elections, but I think this is the time to do it.
[02:19:21.682 --> 02:19:22.643]  Is there a path to do that?
[02:19:24.268 --> 02:19:25.129]  Congress could do that.
[02:19:25.129 --> 02:19:33.797]  Congress could set another election day and say that given the contested presidential election, we're going to have election day on January 19th, for example.
[02:19:33.797 --> 02:19:38.801]  I think they're too cowardly when the Democrats have done this gaslighting saying they want to run this scam.
[02:19:38.801 --> 02:19:44.386]  I think they're just too cowardly, these people in Congress, to absolutely overturn the fraud, which they should.
[02:19:44.386 --> 02:19:47.049]  But I think the third way is a new election.
[02:19:47.049 --> 02:19:48.630]  I think Trump's leaning towards that, I've been told.
[02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:49.291]  Have you talked to him?
[02:19:50.769 --> 02:20:03.527]  Uh, he was always open to that, but he preferred, his original remedy, of course, was preferred that he be declared the winner based on an honest vote count, as happened in 1876 when they threw out the illegal votes and they counted the legal votes.
[02:20:03.527 --> 02:20:06.512]  The, uh, his second remedy was to have the House elect him.
[02:20:07.012 --> 02:20:07.352]  I don't know.
[02:20:29.597 --> 02:20:40.286]  With Robert Barnes, he's one of the smartest brains when it comes to that as well, on the fight forward in 2021 to regain our liberties from this giant, globalist, authoritarian, COVID hoax blitzkrieg.
[02:20:40.286 --> 02:20:41.907]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:41.907 --> 02:20:54.017]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[02:20:55.029 --> 02:21:09.982]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen technocrats over it.
[02:21:09.982 --> 02:21:11.423]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[02:21:11.423 --> 02:21:16.608]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[02:21:16.608 --> 02:21:19.330]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[02:21:20.051 --> 02:21:25.596]  You see, he believes, because he's hidden it in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[02:21:25.596 --> 02:21:27.638]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[02:21:27.638 --> 02:21:29.139]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[02:21:29.139 --> 02:21:33.663]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[02:21:33.663 --> 02:21:35.945]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[02:21:35.945 --> 02:21:37.226]  It is what works.
[02:21:37.226 --> 02:21:42.651]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[02:21:42.651 --> 02:21:45.313]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[02:21:47.978 --> 02:21:48.998]  The Great Reset is here.
[02:21:48.998 --> 02:22:02.742]  The world government has openly been announced, and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family, and to make you so poor, you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income, forced inoculations, and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system.
[02:22:02.742 --> 02:22:15.326]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active, and get prepared for self-defense, and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need, so you're not dependent on the system.

[02:22:48.706 --> 02:22:55.552]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products, in full words, are no longer available.

[02:23:03.399 --> 02:23:05.481]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.

[02:23:11.246 --> 02:23:15.710]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.

[02:23:37.965 --> 02:23:38.645]  It's amazing.
[02:23:38.645 --> 02:23:40.206]  There's no toothpaste out there like it.
[02:23:40.206 --> 02:23:41.987]  And Pollen Block is proprietary as well.
[02:23:41.987 --> 02:23:43.889]  They're back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:23:48.791 --> 02:24:03.877]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:03.877 --> 02:24:12.361]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:24:19.899 --> 02:24:19.939]  2021.
[02:24:19.939 --> 02:24:22.421]  We are now in the year 2021.
[02:24:22.421 --> 02:24:30.368]  A corporate scientific medical dictatorship world government is now upon us.
[02:24:32.443 --> 02:24:36.805]  It was the pretext to send out 80 million basically fraudulent ballots.
[02:24:36.805 --> 02:24:41.228]  It's the pretext to keep certain businesses locked down but other big box stores open.
[02:24:41.228 --> 02:24:45.290]  It's the pretext to vertically integrate the economy and bring in the Great Reset.
[02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:50.193]  China's open for business, laughing that we'll never open again, saying America's done.
[02:24:50.193 --> 02:24:54.055]  Investments flooding into them suddenly like a door was just shut.
[02:24:54.055 --> 02:24:56.316]  And the average leftist is cheering for their own destruction.
[02:24:57.438 --> 02:24:59.759]  Wow, absolutely incredible.
[02:24:59.759 --> 02:25:01.700]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here with us.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:12.826]  I want to get in to the path forward fighting the COVID fraud and legally what to do with them trying to come out with travel passports and telling you it's going to be the law.
[02:25:12.826 --> 02:25:15.887]  They're obviously trying to normalize that right now.
[02:25:15.887 --> 02:25:20.350]  And what you think we as a people can do to resist this.
[02:25:20.350 --> 02:25:24.432]  But first, any other points about the contested election, Trump,
[02:25:25.496 --> 02:25:25.917]  I think so.
[02:25:45.953 --> 02:25:56.375]  A handful of speeches, I mean, less than two hands, less than ten since that November 4th early morning thing saying, I won, this is a scam, these are bad people.
[02:25:56.375 --> 02:25:58.615]  I mean, he knew this was coming, he predicted it all.
[02:25:58.615 --> 02:26:03.036]  Why are we not seeing more from the President?
[02:26:03.036 --> 02:26:11.538]  I think it's because of the fundamental weakness the President has had throughout his four-year tenure has been the lack of allies in key positions of power around him.
[02:26:12.173 --> 02:26:30.457]  And he's coming to terms with the full recognition of what that means, as he sees McConnell's recommended judges betray him at every single level, as he sees McConnell tries to betray him in the Senate on the upcoming vote, as he sees what's happened with the Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia undermining him.
[02:26:30.457 --> 02:26:34.738]  So he now fully appreciates it, but I think he undervalued it before.
[02:26:34.738 --> 02:26:40.039]  And he had too few allies, and the effect of it is smart allies would have him periscoping every single day.
[02:26:40.519 --> 02:26:44.262]  And Big Tech wouldn't have seen a green light to even start censoring him.
[02:26:44.262 --> 02:26:45.522]  I mean this showed weakness.
[02:27:06.576 --> 02:27:13.621]  But another thing about being around the swamp, even trying to organize these Trump events this week, these people will lie right to your face while they stab you in the back.
[02:27:13.621 --> 02:27:17.724]  I mean, this is just next level what the swamp has produced.
[02:27:17.724 --> 02:27:20.266]  Yeah, and I think it's the one thing Trump wasn't fully prepared for.
[02:27:20.266 --> 02:27:28.531]  He didn't understand the degree to which, even though he won because of the institutionalized, corrosive corruption of Washington, D.C.
[02:27:28.531 --> 02:27:33.435]  over the past several decades, he didn't fully appreciate that that meant he needed to truly
[02:27:33.855 --> 02:27:36.536]  Drain the swamp and purge them of their bad actors.
[02:27:36.536 --> 02:27:38.357]  He thought he could negotiate with them.
[02:27:38.357 --> 02:27:45.121]  He thought he could that they would be reasonable and intelligent and recognize that his direction is the smart and savvy direction.
[02:27:45.121 --> 02:27:46.782]  They don't understand that at all.
[02:27:46.782 --> 02:27:57.667]  That's why Mitch McConnell is doing everything possible to kill the Republicans chance to even hold the Senate by every bad strategic decision he's made over the past month, particularly undermining the president.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:01.661]  So I think that hopefully he'll start to put that together.
[02:28:01.661 --> 02:28:09.284]  He did just tweet out that he wants people meeting gathering on January 6th and that he's going to be apparently he's going to be there.
[02:28:09.284 --> 02:28:13.946]  And he's mentioned even a specific time and that location details are going to come out about where it's going to be.
[02:28:14.526 --> 02:28:25.788]  So this is going to be not just a Stop the Steal rally, it's going to be a formal Trump rally at this point, when he's giving locational details about where events are going to take place, where speakers are going to participate.
[02:28:25.788 --> 02:28:31.570]  Well, Barnes, I haven't told you this because I didn't want to become the story, but let me just tell you.
[02:28:31.570 --> 02:28:35.330]  No one was putting the money up two weeks ago for Freedom Plaza.
[02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:38.451]  So I put their initial money up, and it's a lot of money.
[02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:42.256]  Then the Secret Service got involved.
[02:28:42.256 --> 02:28:44.001]  Some folks got contacted.
[02:28:44.001 --> 02:28:44.562]  They reached out.
[02:28:45.723 --> 02:28:52.266]  And they said they want it on the mall now that there's not tall buildings around it, where the Jericho march was a few weeks ago.
[02:28:52.266 --> 02:28:57.849]  Then two days, three days ago, they go, no, it's going to be on the ellipse outside the White House across from it.
[02:28:57.849 --> 02:28:59.230]  So they can have a controlled group.
[02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:00.651]  And there's a larger group outside of that.
[02:29:00.651 --> 02:29:03.412]  We're going to have a peaceful march on the Capitol.
[02:29:03.412 --> 02:29:05.674]  And he was going to be speaking in the afternoon.
[02:29:05.674 --> 02:29:09.676]  We thought it probably was given a menu of ideas.
[02:29:09.676 --> 02:29:12.937]  We thought, and I was in on these meetings, that a morning
[02:29:14.358 --> 02:29:22.607]  Before the debate starts at 1, before Pence is supposed to gavel this in, to have it start at about 11, and then he'll speak right at noon.
[02:29:22.607 --> 02:29:25.109]  And there's actually an event going on before that for several hours.
[02:29:25.109 --> 02:29:26.351]  And so that's what's going on.
[02:29:26.351 --> 02:29:27.892]  That's what's unfolding.
[02:29:27.892 --> 02:29:31.316]  And again, I put the money down because this is all private, folks.
[02:29:31.316 --> 02:29:34.459]  The president doesn't pay for these things with taxpayer money.
[02:29:34.459 --> 02:29:36.622]  So like his inauguration was paid for by donors.
[02:29:37.142 --> 02:29:38.163]  I put the money down for that.
[02:29:38.163 --> 02:29:40.946]  Even though I didn't really have extra money, I did it.
[02:29:40.946 --> 02:29:43.128]  It was hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:29:43.128 --> 02:29:45.170]  And then a big donor came through and took care of that for us.
[02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:47.672]  It's not about me bragging, it's just people know the history.
[02:29:47.672 --> 02:29:50.334]  Trump is speaking at noon at the Ellipse.
[02:29:50.334 --> 02:29:53.858]  The Secret Service might change at the last minute, but it's about to be built right now.
[02:29:55.632 --> 02:29:56.873]  Well, I think that's critical.
[02:29:56.873 --> 02:30:17.269]  I think it was Andrew Jackson's constituency raiding the Capitol that leveraged his power through his first term in 1828 to be willing to take on the bank and even ignore the court's orders, famously, saying that the courts issued its order, they can try to enforce it, and trying to force a bank on the country.
[02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:24.555]  And he helped prevent that concentration of financial power for three decades that ended up leading to the biggest democratic expansion of economics in
[02:30:24.935 --> 02:30:28.496]  World history, arguably, but definitely in American history at the time.
[02:30:28.496 --> 02:30:33.457]  So, it's critical that as many people be there as possible so that Congress feels the pressure.
[02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:53.802]  Because there's some House members and Senators who've been convincing themselves, lying to themselves, that getting past Trump will make them more popular, and that these mail, you know, letters that they've been receiving, emails and texts, and all of it, and phone calls, they're really those, that's just artificial activity and it's not a reflection of a real grassroots commitment to Trump.
[02:30:54.523 --> 02:30:59.966]  Uh, and that's where, you know, if they see a million people there, uh, that's going to, we, that's going to awaken them.
[02:30:59.966 --> 02:31:07.269]  If they see more people there that are going to show up, uh, theoretically for Biden's, uh, inaugural, then that will let them know where they have to vote.
[02:31:07.269 --> 02:31:16.814]  And if, if, if they can hold the line in the Senate or get vice president Pence to step up to the plate, either one, then the president has, it's still a long shot, but he has a fighting chance.
[02:31:16.854 --> 02:31:17.534]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:31:17.534 --> 02:31:20.715]  And regardless, it's to let the system know we're not accepting Joe Biden.
[02:31:20.715 --> 02:31:23.376]  And day one, they said Trump was a Russian agent, no proof.
[02:31:23.376 --> 02:31:28.097]  He's a Russian agent, he's a Chinese agent, open and shut evidence, and we're taking action.
[02:31:28.097 --> 02:31:29.097]  And so that's what this is all about.
[02:31:29.097 --> 02:31:34.639]  But I told the story of how this happened, and I just handed it off immediately, because no one else was stepping up.
[02:31:34.639 --> 02:31:39.020]  And there wasn't a magical Q group, there wasn't a magical Intel group doing it.
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:41.281]  And I had, you know, General Flynn called me yesterday.
[02:31:41.741 --> 02:31:42.221]  I don't know.
[02:31:58.268 --> 02:32:00.229]  Who helped us do it and then paved the line.
[02:32:00.229 --> 02:32:01.330]  Sheriff, we salute her.
[02:32:01.330 --> 02:32:02.070]  She knows who she is.
[02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:03.471]  She doesn't want any credit.
[02:32:03.471 --> 02:32:11.855]  I just want people to know that's how ragtag it is that Trump called you, you know, however many days ago, 50-something days ago, 60 days ago, and said, please come help us.
[02:32:11.855 --> 02:32:14.556]  And, you know, we got the call and it's ragtag.
[02:32:14.556 --> 02:32:15.757]  CNN got that right.
[02:32:15.757 --> 02:32:17.898]  Trump has a ragtag group defending him.
[02:32:17.898 --> 02:32:18.979]  So it's us, folks.
[02:32:18.979 --> 02:32:19.619]  He needs us.
[02:32:19.619 --> 02:32:20.459]  We need him.
[02:32:20.459 --> 02:32:21.220]  Let's go to D.C.
[02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:24.922]  to let them know we're aware of their activity, regardless of the occupation of D.C.
[02:32:24.922 --> 02:32:25.362]  starts now.
[02:32:26.772 --> 02:32:27.913]  Well, and I think exactly.
[02:32:27.913 --> 02:32:36.982]  I mean, it's what led to any sort of form of change or reform has been the willingness and readiness to publicly engage in a democratic manner and a little de-democratic manner.
[02:32:36.982 --> 02:32:40.505]  And that's going to be key no matter what happens, regardless of what the it's the best.
[02:32:40.505 --> 02:32:44.829]  It's the only shot the president has is massive public pressure on the Congress.
[02:32:44.829 --> 02:32:50.715]  And then secondarily, even if that doesn't go the way it needs to go, it's the beginning of a real movement that has
[02:32:51.395 --> 02:32:58.717]  That can last longer and runs deeper and goes wider than the Trump movement did over the last four years.
[02:32:58.717 --> 02:33:06.340]  And for those that don't know, we'll talk about it when we come back in a minute, the vaccine stuff and then the COVID lockdown, but this happened to Jackson.
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:08.301]  He got it stolen, made him bigger later.
[02:33:08.301 --> 02:33:10.922]  We'll talk about what Trump's role should be if they effectively steal it.
[02:33:10.922 --> 02:33:17.844]  He's got to never concede and just be the president in absentia, in exile, and just keep building the movement against him.
[02:33:17.844 --> 02:33:18.304]  Do you agree with that?
[02:33:19.548 --> 02:33:20.769]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:33:20.769 --> 02:33:23.931]  And it needs to be at the... There's been too much focus at the top.
[02:33:23.931 --> 02:33:25.533]  Hugh always focuses on the top.
[02:33:25.533 --> 02:33:28.815]  We need to focus... This needs to be a bottom-up revolution if it's going to work.
[02:33:28.815 --> 02:33:36.881]  If we're going to have real populist reform and resist the sort of Chinese communist model for future world governance, then we have to start with our own... That's right.
[02:33:36.881 --> 02:33:37.782]  Robert Barnes.
[02:33:37.782 --> 02:33:38.703]  Robert Barnes Law.
[02:33:38.703 --> 02:33:39.143]  Stay there.
[02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:45.448]  We're going to come right back with the final conclusion.
[02:33:45.448 --> 02:33:47.149]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:33:47.149 --> 02:33:47.690]  Thank you for holding.
[02:33:48.533 --> 02:33:50.034]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:33:50.034 --> 02:33:51.455]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:33:51.455 --> 02:33:52.656]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:53.396]  How are you?
[02:33:53.396 --> 02:33:54.196]  I love you, man.
[02:33:54.196 --> 02:33:56.518]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:33:56.518 --> 02:33:58.379]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:33:58.379 --> 02:34:14.809]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which, according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:34:15.501 --> 02:34:20.926]  And it helps channel that zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:34:20.926 --> 02:34:32.677]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctors sell them for like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive product in them.
[02:34:32.677 --> 02:34:34.438]  It's really only costing them like 50 bucks.
[02:34:34.438 --> 02:34:39.122]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:34:39.122 --> 02:34:40.584]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:34:45.862 --> 02:34:52.828]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[02:34:52.828 --> 02:34:59.073]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[02:34:59.073 --> 02:35:02.535]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[02:35:02.535 --> 02:35:07.639]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[02:35:07.639 --> 02:35:11.883]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:22.886]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:35:22.886 --> 02:35:27.008]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[02:35:27.008 --> 02:35:33.492]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[02:35:33.492 --> 02:35:39.035]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[02:35:39.035 --> 02:35:39.936]  So help me God.

[02:35:46.943 --> 02:35:51.108]  Fight for Trump on January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:57.935]  Our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny has just begun.
[02:35:57.935 --> 02:35:58.456]  It's 1776 time!
[02:36:02.583 --> 02:36:10.409]  On November 14th, hundreds of thousands of American patriots gathered in the nation's capital to stop the biggest election steal in American history.
[02:36:10.409 --> 02:36:13.311]  America is going under leftist martial law!
[02:36:13.311 --> 02:36:23.038]  And if the communist Chinese agent, Joe Biden, is able to get in there, he will put America under permanent lockdown, siege, until we're brought to our knees!
[02:36:23.038 --> 02:36:23.879]  Stop it!
[02:36:24.319 --> 02:36:26.481]  Hundreds of thousands return to D.C.
[02:36:26.481 --> 02:36:27.261]  in December.
[02:36:27.261 --> 02:36:28.582]  We will never give up.
[02:36:28.582 --> 02:36:29.622]  We will never surrender.
[02:36:29.622 --> 02:36:35.126]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist New World Order.
[02:36:35.126 --> 02:36:36.587]  January 6th.
[02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:37.427]  Fight for Trump.
[02:36:37.427 --> 02:36:37.647]  D.C.
[02:36:37.647 --> 02:36:39.268]  Be there.
[02:36:39.268 --> 02:36:40.409]  We will never give in.
[02:36:40.409 --> 02:36:41.550]  We will never give up.
[02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:43.211]  And we will never back down.
[02:36:43.211 --> 02:36:46.353]  We will never, ever surrender.
[02:36:46.353 --> 02:36:50.896]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:36:50.896 --> 02:36:52.477]  This is taken under the tongue
[02:36:53.417 --> 02:36:55.599]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:36:55.599 --> 02:37:04.807]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:37:04.807 --> 02:37:10.652]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:37:10.652 --> 02:37:12.814]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:37:13.274 --> 02:37:16.497]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:37:16.497 --> 02:37:18.339]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:37:18.339 --> 02:37:20.460]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:22.642]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:37:22.642 --> 02:37:24.003]  Some like bodies better.
[02:37:24.003 --> 02:37:28.147]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[02:37:28.147 --> 02:37:29.328]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:37:38.336 --> 02:37:39.177]  We shall go on to the end.
[02:37:39.177 --> 02:37:40.338]  We shall fight in France.
[02:37:40.338 --> 02:37:41.979]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[02:38:05.808 --> 02:38:11.729]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[02:38:11.729 --> 02:38:15.770]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:17.971]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[02:38:17.971 --> 02:38:20.711]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[02:38:20.711 --> 02:38:24.372]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[02:38:24.372 --> 02:38:26.813]  We shall fight in the hills.
[02:38:26.813 --> 02:38:28.053]  We shall never surrender!
[02:38:31.198 --> 02:38:38.323]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:38:38.323 --> 02:38:44.688]  And by necessity, we are Freedom Command Central, and you keep us in the fight, so I salute you, and I thank you.
[02:38:44.688 --> 02:39:00.579]  And I didn't tell the story about how I'm the guy that got the money, paid the bills, and then I'm literally maxing out my bank account almost, puts in the extra fines, and then a lady, a great patriot came through, magically called me, and paid for almost all of it.
[02:39:02.073 --> 02:39:04.634]  That's what this is all about.
[02:39:04.634 --> 02:39:13.036]  And that's where God comes in if we persevere, if we peacefully resist, if we pray, if we take action.
[02:39:13.036 --> 02:39:14.696]  It's what I like to call the spirit of 1776.
[02:39:14.696 --> 02:39:20.238]  1776, defiance to evil.
[02:39:20.238 --> 02:39:26.679]  All right, separately, it takes a lot of money to fund this operation, plus I got great products you need.
[02:39:26.679 --> 02:39:27.860]  I can buy a model of D3,
[02:39:30.592 --> 02:39:34.055]  Where the D3 costs less than the bottle.
[02:39:34.055 --> 02:39:37.218]  And it's synthetic, and a lot of studies show it doesn't help you.
[02:39:37.218 --> 02:39:42.683]  I've got delicious, high-end, high-quality, good vitamin D3 that you actually absorb.
[02:39:42.683 --> 02:39:44.445]  It's what I take, it's what my children take.
[02:39:44.445 --> 02:39:47.127]  I go out and say, what's the highest quality you can get?
[02:39:47.127 --> 02:39:47.648]  That's Winter Sun.
[02:39:47.648 --> 02:39:52.032]  Even though we're selling out of it, it's still discounted.
[02:39:52.032 --> 02:39:53.934]  All of our products, our fish oil, our krill oil.
[02:39:53.934 --> 02:39:55.115]  I can buy a bottle of krill oil,
[02:39:56.394 --> 02:39:59.816]  For $3 a bottle and sell it to you for $19.95 all day.
[02:39:59.816 --> 02:40:06.060]  Our krill oil cost, depending on which run, how much we order, $10 to $14 a bottle.
[02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:07.400]  Because it's medical grade.
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:14.104]  I mean, it's the highest grade, bright red, crystal clear.
[02:40:14.104 --> 02:40:15.865]  Looks like a glowing red taillight.
[02:40:15.865 --> 02:40:16.546]  You're like, hold it up.
[02:40:16.546 --> 02:40:17.626]  Why is it glowing red?
[02:40:17.626 --> 02:40:19.787]  It's not, it's not, it's not ink, folks.
[02:40:19.787 --> 02:40:20.548]  Nothing looks like that.
[02:40:21.758 --> 02:40:25.447]  Okay, so that's what I'm telling you is, everything we got is the top of the line.
[02:40:25.447 --> 02:40:27.292]  Our turmeric body's top of the line.
[02:40:28.382 --> 02:40:32.406]  Our quail egg concentrate that's knocking out the allergies.
[02:40:32.406 --> 02:40:33.447]  Pollen block.
[02:40:33.447 --> 02:40:34.788]  You can buy cheaper versions of it.
[02:40:34.788 --> 02:40:36.309]  It's A-plus grade.
[02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:40.313]  It's like getting the best steak versus hamburger meat.
[02:40:40.313 --> 02:40:41.494]  Okay, and I'm not knocking hamburger meat.
[02:40:41.494 --> 02:40:41.794]  I love it.
[02:40:41.794 --> 02:40:44.216]  I'm just saying it's the highest grade.
[02:40:44.216 --> 02:40:45.857]  We go for the highest grade.
[02:40:45.857 --> 02:40:46.898]  Our turbo force.
[02:40:46.898 --> 02:40:49.441]  Highest grade natural stimulants.
[02:40:49.441 --> 02:40:51.242]  Highest grade with vitamins and minerals.
[02:40:51.242 --> 02:40:52.643]  Everything's highest grade.
[02:40:52.643 --> 02:40:53.364]  Brain force.
[02:40:53.364 --> 02:40:54.005]  Highest grade.
[02:40:54.889 --> 02:41:00.993]  We had to reformulate it, because what we had was actually prescription to the ingredients in the EU, and I think FDA won't let you do that, so we had to reformulate it.
[02:41:00.993 --> 02:41:03.555]  Be like, I like the old Turbo Force, or Brain Force.
[02:41:03.555 --> 02:41:07.857]  Yeah, so did I. Still, we've got the best available in America.
[02:41:07.857 --> 02:41:12.420]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:17.124]  Our DNA Force, best PQQ, best CoQ10.
[02:41:17.124 --> 02:41:21.747]  I could buy a PQQ or CoQ10 that's synthetic, that costs a third as much.
[02:41:21.747 --> 02:41:23.708]  It's still sold for 50 bucks a bottle.
[02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:26.663]  You understand, folks?
[02:41:26.663 --> 02:41:29.304]  Infowarstore.com.

[02:41:44.893 --> 02:41:47.135]  All right, going back to Robert Martz.
[02:41:49.022 --> 02:41:54.627]  Barnes, let's talk about, because you are one of the best brains, just wide spectrum.
[02:41:54.627 --> 02:41:58.171]  What would you call this giant fraud 11 months in of the COVID rollout?
[02:41:58.171 --> 02:42:02.996]  The world government, the UN, the liability protection, people getting so sick from the vaccines, they don't care.
[02:42:02.996 --> 02:42:06.699]  It seems like they're trying to invoke a mass Stockholm syndrome or something.
[02:42:06.699 --> 02:42:09.642]  What's the big methodology here?
[02:42:09.642 --> 02:42:13.446]  Well, it definitely is a real world Milgram experiment on a global scale.
[02:42:14.730 --> 02:42:23.877]  The system has tried for centuries to figure out how to control the populace, how to control whatever group of people it has under its governance.
[02:42:23.877 --> 02:42:27.159]  And, you know, they tried foreign enemies, but that only got so far.
[02:42:27.159 --> 02:42:30.201]  They tried domestic crime, but that only got so far.
[02:42:30.201 --> 02:42:40.247]  It turns out that a virus is the easiest way to get people to do whatever the government tells them to do, no matter how ludicrous it may be, even if they contradict themselves like they did with masks.
[02:42:40.247 --> 02:42:43.870]  I mean, within months, it went to don't wear them to you have to wear them.
[02:42:44.430 --> 02:42:45.211]  Uh, and all of it.
[02:42:45.211 --> 02:42:49.173]  And now, of course, they're trying to rush an experimental drug.
[02:42:49.173 --> 02:42:53.155]  And that's all a vaccine is, an experimental drug with a fancy label on it.
[02:42:53.155 --> 02:42:57.557]  Uh, that's supposed to have a particularized therapeutic purpose, but it's still a drug at the end of the day.
[02:42:57.557 --> 02:43:01.779]  And this is an experimental one being rushed through on an emergency protocol and procedure.
[02:43:02.419 --> 02:43:07.500]  And done in a way that has not had the kind of testing that we normally should have done.
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:13.461]  And done for a virus that there's never been a coronavirus for which there's never been a successful vaccine.
[02:43:13.461 --> 02:43:20.223]  And now the World Health Organization admitted this week that in fact this vaccine won't actually vaccinate you.
[02:43:20.223 --> 02:43:23.924]  All it will do is reduce the likelihood of you getting particularly severe symptoms.
[02:43:23.924 --> 02:43:25.764]  But it doesn't stop the transmission at all.
[02:43:26.825 --> 02:43:32.211]  In fact, they're now admitting it can cause an autoimmune response to other cold viruses.
[02:43:32.211 --> 02:43:34.234]  So, this is a diabolical plan.
[02:43:34.234 --> 02:43:40.721]  I think they're just setting the precedent to do whatever they want, whenever they want, to get enough people on board where then everyone's in denial into the future.
[02:43:40.721 --> 02:43:42.504]  This is like, this is a giant assault.
[02:43:43.777 --> 02:43:48.839]  It's very much they've looked to the Chinese model of governance to apply that worldwide.
[02:43:48.839 --> 02:44:06.224]  So just as they've using the Chinese social credit model system and how they're doing big tech censorship and suppression against dissident views and decrediting and discrediting those views in exchange for others, they've taken the Chinese model and system for governing their own population and trying to apply it here.
[02:44:06.224 --> 02:44:08.885]  And quote, creating super soldiers with mRNA.
[02:44:08.885 --> 02:44:10.105]  They're not really super soldiers.
[02:44:10.105 --> 02:44:13.306]  They're doing medical experiments on tribes, but you call it super soldiers.
[02:44:14.805 --> 02:44:18.047]  It's China who started out with so much of this mRNA testing.
[02:44:18.047 --> 02:44:20.008]  It's China that released this virus.
[02:44:20.008 --> 02:44:31.194]  It's China that used the lockdown as a mechanism of responding to a virus when that's never been successful in the history of the world, and America's never done it before, and now they're coming with a forced vaccine.
[02:44:31.194 --> 02:44:35.456]  Notably, China doesn't believe that a vaccine is necessary.
[02:44:35.456 --> 02:44:39.018]  There are people out partying in Wuhan last night on New Year's Eve.
[02:44:39.418 --> 02:44:44.001]  So they created this storyline that was terrifying and frightening of bodies dropping dead.
[02:44:44.001 --> 02:44:45.922]  And now we flash forward to New Year's Eve.
[02:44:45.922 --> 02:44:47.683]  China's economy is doing great.
[02:44:47.683 --> 02:44:51.686]  Its governance model system is being expanded and exported throughout the world.
[02:44:51.686 --> 02:44:52.106]  The U.S.
[02:44:52.106 --> 02:44:52.987]  is struggling well.
[02:44:52.987 --> 02:44:57.610]  Wuhan is celebrating with everybody close together and many of them not even wearing masks.
[02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:59.911]  So it gives you an idea for what really happened.
[02:44:59.911 --> 02:45:16.661]  And that's why the next big fight in the U.S., politically and legally, is going to be enforcing the Nuremberg Code, the Nuremberg Accords, which said they cannot do any form of invasive medical treatment on you without your informed consent.
[02:45:16.661 --> 02:45:22.505]  Any form of mandatory vaccines violates the Nuremberg Code, violates the Nuremberg Accord.
[02:45:22.505 --> 02:45:26.367]  We said it would be never again would we allow any state
[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:28.022]  And again, Robert Barnes, this is like
[02:45:39.002 --> 02:45:41.484]  If Hitler was bad, which he was, that was 1.0.
[02:45:41.484 --> 02:45:42.945]  This is like 5.0.
[02:45:42.945 --> 02:45:45.667]  This is like way worse, way crazier.
[02:46:11.123 --> 02:46:15.466]  Well, it's them having ultimate control over the world's population.
[02:46:15.466 --> 02:46:27.613]  Not only the number of us that live, Bill Gates is publicly on record saying he wants to reduce the number of live human beings in the future by the tens and hundreds of millions and even billions over time.
[02:46:27.613 --> 02:46:33.337]  And it's also the mindset of control, just people who like control, who want control and seek control.
[02:46:33.337 --> 02:46:36.959]  And that's why now the upside to what the World Health Organization said
[02:46:37.714 --> 02:46:52.279]  Is that constitutionally, I'll be debating Alan Dershowitz, Professor Dershowitz on this in the coming weeks, but I don't believe that even his argument holds water anymore about mandating vaccines if a vaccine does not in fact prevent transmission of the virus.
[02:46:52.279 --> 02:47:01.723]  That's the only legal excuse they've ever had is to say a person presents a clear and present danger without being vaccinated because they could transmit the virus.
[02:47:02.163 --> 02:47:07.587]  Everybody agrees, even Dershowitz, that you cannot force a vaccine on someone solely for their own benefit.
[02:47:07.587 --> 02:47:12.430]  And by the way, Robert, I would love to invite you and Dershowitz on, and I would fairly moderate.
[02:47:12.430 --> 02:47:13.851]  I would not even make comments.
[02:47:13.851 --> 02:47:15.832]  I would love to have a commercial-free deal.
[02:47:15.832 --> 02:47:16.612]  Millions would tune in.
[02:47:16.612 --> 02:47:20.695]  My Joe Rogan interview has 3.2 million views, and something like that.
[02:47:20.695 --> 02:47:28.100]  I think we get millions of views, and you guys can repost it wherever, but I would love to have you guys on for like an hour-long commercial-free debate.
[02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:29.380]  Then I would air excerpts on the show.
[02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:30.041]  That'd be a great idea.
[02:47:31.266 --> 02:47:32.206]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:47:32.206 --> 02:47:33.087]  He's a game for it.
[02:47:33.087 --> 02:47:33.747]  He's up for it.
[02:47:33.747 --> 02:47:41.589]  So we're discussing... You set it up and you tell me the time, and some afternoon we'll just tape an hour, or we can stream it live, and then I'll air it on the show the next day.
[02:47:41.589 --> 02:47:42.910]  How's that sound?
[02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:44.150]  Oh yeah, sounds great.
[02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:47.631]  So it's basically his schedule's dictating the time and the terms.
[02:47:47.631 --> 02:47:48.612]  Oh no, you talk to him.
[02:47:48.612 --> 02:47:58.895]  So, and you say what you want about Dershowitz and all the weirdness, but he is one of the top lawyers in the world, and that's why it's shocking to see him, right on so many things, talking about plunging needles in people's arms.
[02:48:00.336 --> 02:48:03.597]  Well, he has deep deference to the professional class.
[02:48:03.597 --> 02:48:05.898]  And that's where we have our strongest disagreement.
[02:48:05.898 --> 02:48:10.881]  He trusts the experts in other fields that he wouldn't trust in his own legal field.
[02:48:10.881 --> 02:48:13.062]  But that's why we have to challenge it and contest it.
[02:48:13.062 --> 02:48:19.484]  If we do not have the rights to protect our own bodies from having a forced drug stuck into our systems, then what rights do we have?
[02:48:19.484 --> 02:48:20.165]  We have no rights.
[02:48:20.165 --> 02:48:23.386]  This is the final revolution against our very persons, our very DNA.
[02:48:23.386 --> 02:48:25.147]  We'll do five more minutes with us and you're going to go.
[02:48:25.147 --> 02:48:28.508]  The Dale Bigtree powerful interview coming up.
[02:48:28.508 --> 02:48:29.489]  And then we've got...
[02:48:29.969 --> 02:48:32.081]  The one, the only, Dr. Nick Baggett.
[02:48:32.081 --> 02:48:33.207]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:48:35.182 --> 02:48:42.528]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[02:48:42.528 --> 02:48:43.969]  We've got two different big sales.
[02:48:43.969 --> 02:48:51.215]  We've got Super Metal Vitality Turbo Force and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[02:48:51.215 --> 02:48:56.679]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack, at 40% off.
[02:48:56.679 --> 02:49:04.245]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot Points.
[02:49:04.485 --> 02:49:05.766]  The best deal ever.
[02:49:05.766 --> 02:49:11.188]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[02:49:11.188 --> 02:49:13.949]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[02:49:13.949 --> 02:49:21.392]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that it's more critical than ever.
[02:49:21.392 --> 02:49:27.915]  Again, the year 2021 is here and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[02:49:27.915 --> 02:49:30.516]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[02:49:30.516 --> 02:49:32.377]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[02:49:36.161 --> 02:49:50.165]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[02:49:50.165 --> 02:49:52.166]  It's all now completely official.
[02:49:52.166 --> 02:49:57.568]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab.
[02:49:57.568 --> 02:50:02.529]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation and all the rest of them.
[02:50:02.529 --> 02:50:03.230]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:03.510]  It's here.
[02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:12.053]  And it only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[02:50:12.053 --> 02:50:18.376]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[02:50:18.376 --> 02:50:20.557]  We must start valuing human life again.
[02:50:20.557 --> 02:50:27.459]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[02:50:27.459 --> 02:50:30.220]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:33.642]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[02:50:39.267 --> 02:50:46.990]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:46.990 --> 02:50:51.072]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[02:50:51.072 --> 02:50:59.576]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[02:50:59.576 --> 02:51:04.558]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[02:51:04.558 --> 02:51:06.719]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
[02:51:06.719 --> 02:51:06.919]  Yeah.
[02:51:08.291 --> 02:51:09.172]  A new disease.
[02:51:09.172 --> 02:51:10.133]  No one's immune.
[02:51:10.133 --> 02:51:13.575]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[02:51:13.575 --> 02:51:15.497]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[02:51:15.497 --> 02:51:20.181]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[02:51:20.181 --> 02:51:21.842]  He loves being that guy.
[02:51:21.842 --> 02:51:24.484]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[02:51:24.484 --> 02:51:26.466]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[02:51:26.466 --> 02:51:30.970]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[02:51:30.970 --> 02:51:34.733]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[02:51:34.733 --> 02:51:35.474]  Get over here, NBC.
[02:51:37.795 --> 02:51:43.660]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh!
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:44.621]  Wow!
[02:51:44.621 --> 02:51:45.422]  Wow!
[02:51:45.422 --> 02:51:46.042]  Oh yeah!
[02:51:46.042 --> 02:51:48.244]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[02:51:48.244 --> 02:51:52.687]  Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[02:51:52.687 --> 02:51:55.490]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[02:51:55.490 --> 02:51:57.992]  House Cat Flu is coming, people!
[02:51:57.992 --> 02:52:05.378]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the House Cat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[02:52:07.133 --> 02:52:12.711]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles!
[02:52:21.383 --> 02:52:22.364]  Well, there you go.
[02:52:22.364 --> 02:52:24.426]  Instead of making it the cat, though, it's all of us.
[02:52:24.426 --> 02:52:25.087]  We're dirty.
[02:52:25.087 --> 02:52:27.829]  We've got to wear masks, even though we're totally healthy.
[02:52:27.829 --> 02:52:29.651]  It's the final revolution of the post-human world.
[02:52:29.651 --> 02:52:31.733]  We ought to be teaching our kids that humans are bad.
[02:52:31.733 --> 02:52:33.014]  They ought to all commit suicide.
[02:52:33.014 --> 02:52:37.778]  Robert Barnes, you hit the old nail on the head with a laser beam.
[02:52:38.379 --> 02:53:02.068]  When you said, we have to do Nuremberg trials, we have to do Geneva Convention, we have to do Nuremberg Code violations, and really, because this is very aggressive to lie, to pressure people, to try to say it's mandatory, and to come and say we're going to give you all inoculations with something super dangerous that's not even a vaccine, so it's a mutagenic drug, to have this new mutagenic revolution of gene therapy that people should be able to decide if they want it.
[02:53:02.068 --> 02:53:04.569]  And what's crazy is they cover up this gene therapy,
[02:53:06.343 --> 02:53:18.613]  With something really destructive, which I almost think they want to discredit the field, because some of it's so actually promising, like antibodies that 100% destroy things like colon cancer, but they don't want us to have that.
[02:53:18.613 --> 02:53:23.617]  I mean, there's a bigger sick agenda here, Barnes.
[02:53:23.617 --> 02:53:24.898]  No doubt about that whatsoever.
[02:53:24.898 --> 02:53:32.904]  I mean, and it's been in the works now for the better part of a century, to the degree that The Simpsons could preview it, as we were just witnessing.
[02:53:32.904 --> 02:53:34.646]  And that was 25 years ago they did that.
[02:53:35.586 --> 02:53:35.906]  Absolutely.
[02:53:35.906 --> 02:53:40.030]  And really, it was activities they were wanting to do at the beginning of the last century.
[02:53:40.030 --> 02:53:58.406]  That's when the Jacobson decision came about that greenlit the idea of forced vaccines, that introduced the idea of eugenics into the law, that led to the Buck decision, that led to the Korematsu decision, and it got suppressed because the Nazis discredited this method of governance, this method of medical science.
[02:53:58.866 --> 02:53:59.487]  We're good to go.
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:22.065]  Because he got all the politicians terrified of their local health boards, and the local health boards were all terrified of whatever the WHO said.
[02:54:22.065 --> 02:54:29.230]  And the WHO was just reading off of Bill Gates' script, and his script is obsessed about controlling population and controlling people.
[02:54:29.230 --> 02:54:32.593]  And now we witness what that looks like, and it's very dangerous and precarious.
[02:54:32.593 --> 02:54:36.556]  It's a reintroduction of Nazi ideology, just in a different guise.
[02:54:36.556 --> 02:54:40.619]  It's a reintroduction of globalism, but under a different strategy of protecting you.
[02:54:40.619 --> 02:54:42.240]  And how does Alan Dershowitz not see that?
[02:54:43.781 --> 02:54:48.024]  Because he sees that people that are doctors say it's good and so he assumes it's so.
[02:54:48.024 --> 02:54:49.784]  It's a deference to medical science.
[02:54:49.784 --> 02:54:50.465]  It's a deference.
[02:54:50.465 --> 02:54:52.126]  I call it white coat disease.
[02:54:52.126 --> 02:54:53.947]  It's a version of the Milgram experiment.
[02:54:53.947 --> 02:54:57.909]  I mean doctors chop off the wrong legs, take out the wrong kidneys.
[02:54:57.909 --> 02:54:59.350]  I mean it's fraught with problems.
[02:55:00.305 --> 02:55:04.606]  Not only that, if all the doctors and nurses so love this vaccine, why are they objecting to it?
[02:55:04.606 --> 02:55:05.666]  80%!
[02:55:05.666 --> 02:55:07.847]  In Europe and the United States.
[02:55:07.847 --> 02:55:10.087]  They know that this has all kinds of risks.
[02:55:10.087 --> 02:55:16.529]  Remember folks, the last time we did a forced rushed vaccine for any kind of flu virus, 1976, look at what happened.
[02:55:16.529 --> 02:55:18.829]  You can look, that was back when 60 Minutes was honest.
[02:55:18.829 --> 02:55:22.190]  Look at what 60 Minutes' expose was about what happened with that rushed vaccine.
[02:55:22.230 --> 02:55:24.413]  Barnes, you're knocking it out of the park.
[02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:25.214]  Let's talk off air.
[02:55:25.214 --> 02:55:26.696]  I'm doing a special live show tomorrow.
[02:55:26.696 --> 02:55:30.481]  If you can do it, I'd like to have you on for a full hour about the vaccines and how to fight back.
[02:55:30.481 --> 02:55:32.764]  But regardless, Yelp Big Freak's coming up.
[02:55:32.764 --> 02:55:33.485]  Stay with us.
[02:55:33.485 --> 02:55:35.347]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:55:35.347 --> 02:55:37.510]  Be sure and find Barnes on Twitter.
[02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:39.132]  Type in his name, Robert Barnes.
[02:55:39.132 --> 02:55:40.073]  You can't miss him.
[02:55:40.073 --> 02:55:40.554]  He'll be back.
[02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:48.533]  Inflation is here, and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming.
[02:55:48.533 --> 02:55:52.136]  Especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[02:55:52.136 --> 02:55:57.381]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[02:55:57.381 --> 02:56:03.747]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[02:56:04.187 --> 02:56:07.631]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[02:56:07.631 --> 02:56:09.914]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[02:56:09.914 --> 02:56:17.923]  The globalists are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[02:56:17.923 --> 02:56:21.527]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and
[02:56:21.607 --> 02:56:22.388]  Get ready.
[02:56:22.388 --> 02:56:34.114]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up at preparewithalex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storable foods out there.
[02:56:34.114 --> 02:56:43.420]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at preparewithalex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality storable food.
[02:56:52.518 --> 02:57:07.636]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:57:07.636 --> 02:57:10.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:14.923 --> 02:57:16.004]  Alright, this is incredible.
[02:57:16.004 --> 02:57:19.426]  We've got Del Bigtree in studio, the host of The High Wire.
[02:57:19.426 --> 02:57:28.893]  And, you know, I'm like, I'm kind of like, I've explained it, I'm like a shotgunner, where a shotgun has a spread.
[02:57:28.893 --> 02:57:32.076]  So I fire a shotgun, I'm hitting like a two-foot spread potentially.
[02:57:33.527 --> 02:57:37.968]  Del Bigtree is like a sniper when it comes to the vaccines and everything that's going on.
[02:57:37.968 --> 02:57:42.629]  And so he has a document in front of him here, and I said, hey Del, what does that document have?
[02:57:42.629 --> 02:57:43.769]  And he was just explaining this to me.
[02:57:43.769 --> 02:57:45.589]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:57:45.589 --> 02:57:47.530]  And thank God for Del Bigtree.
[02:57:47.530 --> 02:57:51.951]  Thank God for other doctors and nurses that are out there investigating this, raising awareness.
[02:57:51.951 --> 02:57:54.191]  So again, Del Bigtree in studio with us.
[02:57:54.191 --> 02:57:55.991]  The High Wire is his show.
[02:57:55.991 --> 02:57:57.712]  Of course, he's banned everywhere, too.
[02:57:57.712 --> 02:57:58.912]  The remarkable honor.
[02:57:59.612 --> 02:58:00.673]  But so this is incredible.
[02:58:00.673 --> 02:58:05.678]  Explain to me what this document is and why we should all be up in arms about this.
[02:58:05.678 --> 02:58:10.663]  So there's multiple issues we knew over the last 20 years trying to make a coronavirus vaccine.
[02:58:10.663 --> 02:58:11.703]  We have failed, right?
[02:58:11.703 --> 02:58:13.265]  That's been an absolute disaster.
[02:58:13.265 --> 02:58:17.549]  Every single pharmaceutical company that's attempted it has run into the same issue.
[02:58:17.549 --> 02:58:19.210]  It's called immune enhancement.
[02:58:19.210 --> 02:58:23.254]  Sometimes it's called antibody dependent enhancement or pathogenic priming.
[02:58:23.254 --> 02:58:24.956]  But however they talk about it, here's what happens.
[02:58:25.276 --> 02:58:28.540]  They gave the animals in all of the animal trials for the last 20 years.
[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:30.242]  They give the animal the vaccine.
[02:58:30.242 --> 02:58:31.203]  It looks like it's safe.
[02:58:31.203 --> 02:58:32.504]  The animals are doing just fine.
[02:58:32.504 --> 02:58:33.325]  They test their blood.
[02:58:33.325 --> 02:58:34.887]  They have plenty of antibodies.
[02:58:34.887 --> 02:58:36.429]  Looks like the vaccine's working.
[02:58:36.429 --> 02:58:43.597]  Then they go one step further, which is a challenge trial, where they actually inject the animal with coronavirus and something diabolical happens.
[02:58:43.597 --> 02:58:46.160]  Instead of the antibodies protecting the animal,
[02:58:46.480 --> 02:58:52.848]  It actually drew the virus in deeper, faster, proliferated faster, and caused what's called a cytokine storm.
[02:58:52.848 --> 02:59:03.401]  This is a total immune system shutdown, like overload, hyperdrive, organ failure, what they call TH2 immunopathology in the lungs where they cannot breathe, killed animals.
[02:59:03.681 --> 02:59:05.002]  Now we have a history of this happening.
[02:59:05.002 --> 02:59:08.586]  There was an RSV vaccine back in the 1960s for children.
[02:59:08.586 --> 02:59:09.727]  It got hundreds.
[02:59:09.727 --> 02:59:10.148]  Same thing.
[02:59:10.148 --> 02:59:13.951]  It looked like the vaccine was safe until the kids came in contact with RSV.
[02:59:13.951 --> 02:59:17.975]  Then the vaccine worked like a catalyst to make the illness more deadly.
[02:59:17.975 --> 02:59:18.716]  Babies died.
[02:59:18.716 --> 02:59:19.337]  We canceled it.
[02:59:19.617 --> 02:59:24.140]  Over a year ago, same thing happened with Deng vaccine, the Dengue vaccine in the Philippines.
[02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:26.682]  We gave it to, you know, thousands of people.
[02:59:26.682 --> 02:59:32.065]  Then when they came in contact with Dengue, months later, the vaccine actually made Dengue deadly.
[02:59:32.065 --> 02:59:35.808]  600 people died from what should have been a fever.
[02:59:35.808 --> 02:59:37.609]  We discontinued that vaccine.
[02:59:37.609 --> 02:59:39.651]  This is the problem that they've had with this vaccine.
[02:59:39.651 --> 02:59:47.496]  So all the work I've been doing, whether it's Pfizer's vaccine or Moderna's vaccine, we've been looking at all their trials and saying their trials are not
[02:59:47.856 --> 02:59:55.139]  Proving that they have overcome this diabolical problem, which means next year, after you've had the vaccine, you could think you're doing fine.
[02:59:55.139 --> 03:00:05.483]  All of a sudden, you come in contact with coronavirus, and you drop dead in the street because it made the coronavirus deadly, which you and I both know, for 99.9% of us, this isn't deadly.
[03:00:05.483 --> 03:00:08.345]  This vaccine makes it, could make it deadly.
[03:00:08.345 --> 03:00:10.185]  Now, it's hypothetical, but here's the point.
[03:00:10.185 --> 03:00:13.787]  Well, let's reiterate though, because this is so important to focus on.
[03:00:15.149 --> 03:00:18.073]  They have presented this information to the FDA.
[03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:19.434]  This is the FDA document.
[03:00:19.434 --> 03:00:25.141]  When they were getting approval for this emergency use authorization, this is everything they admitted to the FDA.
[03:00:25.141 --> 03:00:30.708]  They have an entire list of issues that they don't know if they've overcome.
[03:00:30.708 --> 03:00:32.810]  Their list of unknowns, right?
[03:00:33.371 --> 03:00:35.113]  I always think of, you know, was it Rumsfeld?
[03:00:35.113 --> 03:00:38.598]  There's the known unknowns, there's the unknown unknowns.
[03:00:38.598 --> 03:00:39.419]  It's a bit like that.
[03:00:39.419 --> 03:00:40.460]  There's what they don't know.
[03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:42.102]  So in it is this giant list.
[03:00:42.102 --> 03:00:43.183]  But this is the issue.
[03:00:43.183 --> 03:00:47.369]  This is what I brought here on this show before, and here it is in plain writing.
[03:00:47.369 --> 03:00:48.170]  Let me read this to you.
[03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:49.931]  Vaccine-enhanced disease.
[03:00:49.931 --> 03:00:52.073]  This is immune enhancement I'm talking about.
[03:00:52.073 --> 03:00:55.596]  A deadly problem that, you know, they've been seeing in all the animal trials.
[03:00:55.596 --> 03:01:04.783]  Available data do not indicate a risk of vaccine-enhanced disease and conversely suggest effectiveness against severe disease within the available follow-up period.
[03:01:04.783 --> 03:01:11.268]  However, risk of vaccine-enhanced disease over time potentially associated with waning immunity
[03:01:11.528 --> 03:01:11.888]  We're good.
[03:01:28.018 --> 03:01:28.178]  That's
[03:01:44.475 --> 03:01:46.716]  Even, let's just say it's one in a million, but it's not.
[03:01:46.716 --> 03:01:49.797]  We're talking about something that happened in almost every animal trial.
[03:01:49.797 --> 03:01:55.718]  But even if it's one in a million problem, or like the infertility we're seeing issues with, real problems with infertility.
[03:01:55.718 --> 03:02:07.222]  The antibodies, if they attack this spike protein, it looks so much like the outer layer of the placenta, the syncytin, that if it starts attacking placentas, no one will be able to get pregnant.
[03:02:07.222 --> 03:02:10.163]  These are legitimate, theoretical issues.
[03:02:10.163 --> 03:02:12.323]  And that's by design, with the RNA.
[03:02:12.323 --> 03:02:13.944]  They wanted it specifically after that
[03:02:14.224 --> 03:02:17.186]  Spike protein so that it could latch on.
[03:02:17.186 --> 03:02:17.507]  Right.
[03:02:17.507 --> 03:02:21.730]  So all of these things, when you do trials, this is why you do safety trials.
[03:02:21.730 --> 03:02:35.740]  When they say, well, we've accomplished in, you know, six months, what usually takes eight years, the eight years is overcoming crap like this is making sure that we see women get pregnant and that we see their children grow up and see their children get pregnant in the future.
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:36.381]  Do you realize?
[03:02:36.721 --> 03:02:42.427]  We have seen drugs that take away your ability to be fertile only because your mother got it while she was pregnant.
[03:02:42.427 --> 03:02:45.811]  You finally get to childbearing age and you can't give birth.
[03:02:45.811 --> 03:02:47.013]  I'm so glad you said that.
[03:02:47.013 --> 03:02:52.919]  This is the type of issues that we need to see that we've overcome before all of us start being forced to get this vaccine.
[03:02:52.919 --> 03:02:56.263]  It could be literally the end of our species if we get this wrong.
[03:02:56.363 --> 03:02:59.807]  And by the way, I'm just a linear, logical thinker here.
[03:02:59.807 --> 03:03:05.794]  So, okay, you've got this vaccine that they admit they don't even know it could cause a cytokine storm.
[03:03:05.794 --> 03:03:12.422]  Well, now imagine you have just, I mean, God forbid, let's hope this doesn't happen, but you've just injected all these nurses
[03:03:12.702 --> 03:03:23.687]  And doctors with the vaccine, some of them are gonna get COVID, whether that happened to the guy that got the vaccine and then tested positive for COVID eight days later, whether that's his story or not, could be a false positive, we really don't know.
[03:03:23.687 --> 03:03:34.533]  The point is, you've now created this situation where you could have these nurses and doctors having cytokine storms, you could have Bell Palsy with the, I mean, we're already seeing that, and they've set themselves up, and they admit they don't even know!
[03:03:34.533 --> 03:03:35.993]  They don't even know if this could be happening!
[03:03:35.993 --> 03:03:39.355]  And I'm so glad you brought the pregnancy issue up, because this story was in the USA Today
[03:03:40.694 --> 03:03:46.000]  Pregnant women do not receive vaccines, but more study needed on COVID-19 shot.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:50.725]  Now, if you read this, it's like the most upside-down world thing.
[03:03:50.725 --> 03:03:57.292]  Half the time they're saying pregnant women shouldn't get it because of all the side effects, and then the other half they're saying, but it's okay, pregnant women can get it if they want to.
[03:03:58.325 --> 03:04:09.609]  But they admit, and they even get quotes from health officials and the vaccine manufacturers, they even admit that they tell you, if you get a COVID vaccine, they tell you no sexual activity for two weeks.
[03:04:09.609 --> 03:04:12.090]  No activity that could lead to pregnancy for two weeks.
[03:04:12.090 --> 03:04:13.851]  So they know there's a risk there.
[03:04:13.851 --> 03:04:24.535]  They already know there's a risk there, and they obviously haven't done the trials when they are telling you, okay, we don't know the risk, so for two weeks after you get the vaccine, no sexual activity that could lead to a pregnancy.
[03:04:24.875 --> 03:04:27.679]  So, how are we supposed to even know?
[03:04:27.679 --> 03:04:37.190]  Like you said, we could be injecting these things and then a month, two months, a year, four years later realize, wait a second, these vaccines just cause women to be fertile.
[03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:38.171]  Infertile, excuse me.
[03:04:39.793 --> 03:04:39.933]  The
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:02.081]  We have no reference point to previous vaccines.
[03:05:02.081 --> 03:05:04.943]  They say, well, we saw a history of this with these vaccines.
[03:05:04.943 --> 03:05:13.547]  This is a brand new technology that is turning our bodies into manufacturing plants of the virus, not of the antibodies.
[03:05:13.547 --> 03:05:16.729]  What that RNA message is doing is it's going to our cells and saying,
[03:05:17.329 --> 03:05:17.609]  I think?
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:59.508]  And you know, I'm curious too, I mean, this is just from somebody that likes personal fitness and health, and I don't know if the vaccine works the same way, but it's kind of like you would develop a tolerance to it, and so it could become a thing where your body stops naturally producing that 23rd spike protein, and it's reliant on the vaccine, so then you literally have to get the vaccine to produce the protein.
[03:05:59.508 --> 03:06:01.429]  I mean, you could potentially see a situation like that.
[03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:04.731]  You could see so many different, every one of them.
[03:06:04.731 --> 03:06:05.952]  It's unknown, they say.
[03:06:05.952 --> 03:06:07.974]  That's what unknown is all about, right?
[03:06:07.974 --> 03:06:08.854]  This is science.
[03:06:08.854 --> 03:06:10.115]  This is why it's great.
[03:06:10.115 --> 03:06:17.021]  This is supposed to be happening in lab animals for the next 40 years and maybe into some people that really want to take the risk and jump out there.
[03:06:17.021 --> 03:06:19.463]  You don't put this in your entire population.
[03:06:19.463 --> 03:06:23.225]  By the way, that two weeks of not getting pregnant, that's just for women.
[03:06:23.225 --> 03:06:28.289]  There's a study right now going on in the University of Miami on the sperm in men that are in this.
[03:06:28.289 --> 03:06:31.572]  There is the possibility that this is going to cause
[03:06:31.772 --> 03:06:33.994]  And you are tuned in to the first live show of the new year.
[03:06:33.994 --> 03:06:34.674]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.674 --> 03:06:38.698]  See the full interview Ellen did with Dale Bigtree at Bandot Video and share it.
[03:06:38.698 --> 03:06:40.920]  Coming up, the one, the only, Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:41.320]  Stay with us.
[03:06:53.610 --> 03:06:56.411]  Aspartame, as they're flavoring, very, very toxic.
[03:06:56.411 --> 03:06:58.092]  And also they have fluoride in it.
[03:06:58.092 --> 03:06:59.313]  This does not have the fluoride.
[03:06:59.313 --> 03:07:00.714]  It doesn't have the additives.
[03:07:00.714 --> 03:07:01.934]  This is a concentrate.
[03:07:01.934 --> 03:07:03.395]  It really is high quality.
[03:07:03.395 --> 03:07:08.557]  It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.
[03:07:08.557 --> 03:07:10.338]  But now it's back in stock.
[03:07:10.338 --> 03:07:15.681]  Infowars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste, now back in stock.
[03:07:16.061 --> 03:07:16.561]  Thank you.
[03:07:41.926 --> 03:07:44.288]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[03:07:44.288 --> 03:07:47.130]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[03:07:47.130 --> 03:07:47.890]  Yes, sir.
[03:07:47.890 --> 03:07:48.311]  Yes, sir.
[03:07:48.311 --> 03:07:55.836]  I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[03:07:55.836 --> 03:07:59.478]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[03:07:59.478 --> 03:08:07.764]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[03:08:07.764 --> 03:08:10.566]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20.
[03:08:11.647 --> 03:08:13.868]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[03:08:13.868 --> 03:08:21.053]  We didn't know, we didn't screen your call, we had no idea, and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[03:08:45.028 --> 03:09:03.056]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:03.056 --> 03:09:08.718]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:09:16.026 --> 03:09:19.108]  Well, boy, that's hard to follow.
[03:09:19.108 --> 03:09:27.214]  Man, that's a powerful, powerful last couple hours, I got to say.
[03:09:27.214 --> 03:09:32.097]  And as usual, when I'm on, I kind of change the tone a bit.
[03:09:32.097 --> 03:09:33.338]  And I plan to do that today.
[03:09:33.338 --> 03:09:41.504]  You know, I was thinking about this as I went on this concept, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:09:41.504 --> 03:09:43.125]  Happy New Year, everyone.
[03:09:43.125 --> 03:09:45.187]  Do you feel it?
[03:09:47.268 --> 03:09:50.851]  You know, and I mean that sincerely, all right?
[03:09:50.851 --> 03:09:51.411]  Okay?
[03:09:51.411 --> 03:09:55.334]  Think about this for just one moment.
[03:09:55.334 --> 03:09:56.515]  Should we feel that?
[03:09:56.515 --> 03:09:57.556]  I think so.
[03:09:57.556 --> 03:09:58.597]  You know, why do I feel?
[03:09:58.597 --> 03:10:06.443]  People always ask, you're always smiling, you're always happy, even in the midst of, like, the sky is falling, right?
[03:10:06.443 --> 03:10:10.146]  I mean, in the middle of an earthquake, if you will.
[03:10:10.146 --> 03:10:11.346]  And I'll tell you why.
[03:10:11.346 --> 03:10:15.870]  I'll tell you sincerely why, because I know how the story ends, and I'm really not so worried about it.
[03:10:17.411 --> 03:10:28.216]  And I want to talk about a lot of that today because here we are launching into 2021 and we're doing it together with information.
[03:10:28.216 --> 03:10:33.138]  Okay, that's what we've been getting all week, all year.
[03:10:33.138 --> 03:10:34.919]  Now we're going to get it all this year.
[03:10:34.919 --> 03:10:42.783]  And on the platform of all that information comes thinking and feeling, the mind and heart, if you will,
[03:10:44.562 --> 03:10:47.343]  And then the universal, if you want to plug that in.
[03:10:47.343 --> 03:10:49.924]  And I think we should, because that's where the power is.
[03:10:49.924 --> 03:10:55.186]  And so I'm talking about probably more about that these days.
[03:10:55.186 --> 03:10:55.987]  You know, I sent out
[03:10:57.674 --> 03:11:05.180]  Something to all of my closest friends and I want to share with you guys because you're a part of that mix and it's just a little short thing.
[03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:16.108]  I'll just read one paragraph of it and it was my kind of launch to the new year and it's about friendship which could be my theme of a lot of what I'm talking about today.
[03:11:16.108 --> 03:11:19.931]  Friendship is a garden that requires cultivation.
[03:11:19.931 --> 03:11:23.653]  It is in fact the highest form of love and realization.
[03:11:23.653 --> 03:11:26.896]  Love is how the universe characterizes itself.
[03:11:28.388 --> 03:11:37.450]  Not a human love of trade-offs and expectations, but rather in an unconditional form of love.
[03:11:37.450 --> 03:11:38.230]  Wow!
[03:11:38.230 --> 03:11:40.731]  Think about that for just a moment.
[03:11:40.731 --> 03:11:42.592]  That's part of what I sent out anyway.
[03:11:42.592 --> 03:11:43.552]  I won't read you the rest.
[03:11:43.552 --> 03:11:50.834]  But the point is, how does God define itself?
[03:11:50.834 --> 03:11:52.654]  In one form, it's God is love.
[03:11:52.654 --> 03:11:56.555]  You know, that's pretty powerful if you stop and think about it.
[03:11:57.375 --> 03:12:16.159]  You know, and here's part of this thing I've been talking about for weeks, actually kind of embedded in a lot of the different presentations, this idea that, you know, how we interpret the thing and then choose to act decides a lot about sort of what's happening with it.
[03:12:16.159 --> 03:12:19.000]  And that's the free choice deal.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:23.361]  And when I go into the programs, one of the things I think about is
[03:12:24.926 --> 03:12:34.494]  I think I know what I'm going to say, and usually it's not exactly what I had in mind, but I really pray really hard to not say the wrong thing because I'm responsible for that.
[03:12:34.494 --> 03:12:40.479]  See, if I say the wrong thing and I motivate people in the wrong direction, I'm responsible for that.
[03:12:40.479 --> 03:12:41.279]  So I don't want to do that.
[03:12:41.279 --> 03:12:44.842]  I'd rather be struck silent.
[03:12:44.842 --> 03:12:45.903]  You know, I mean it.
[03:12:45.903 --> 03:12:47.864]  Struck dead than make the mistake.
[03:12:47.864 --> 03:12:54.670]  So I try to inform from the head and the heart and ask God to clear the deck that I don't screw it up.
[03:12:55.251 --> 03:13:01.036]  And I think that's what all of us are trying to do before our event, you know, when I come on the air.
[03:13:01.036 --> 03:13:07.781]  But that's what all of us should be doing before our individual events.
[03:13:07.781 --> 03:13:21.773]  Whatever that is, going to work, waking up in the morning, you know, have your prayer, your conversation with God, who is not always recognized in the, maybe I think, the right way.
[03:13:21.773 --> 03:13:23.634]  But think of God as your friend.
[03:13:25.370 --> 03:13:38.639]  You know, and have that conversation, you know, and don't think you got to use a bunch of special words and forget about your normal vocabulary that you're thinking in your head that you might want to speak out in church.
[03:13:38.639 --> 03:13:41.721]  But let me tell you something about all that.
[03:13:41.721 --> 03:13:44.202]  If it's in your head, God already figured it out.
[03:13:44.202 --> 03:13:48.845]  Yeah, you're flawed just like me and everyone else.
[03:13:48.845 --> 03:13:51.507]  But here's the thing.
[03:13:51.507 --> 03:13:52.588]  Are you available?
[03:13:53.208 --> 03:13:57.171]  To get anything done, flawed or not.
[03:13:57.171 --> 03:13:58.932]  And that's a deeper question.
[03:13:58.932 --> 03:14:01.434]  And one we usually shrink from, right?
[03:14:01.434 --> 03:14:03.756]  Because we see all of our flaws.
[03:14:03.756 --> 03:14:07.699]  The only one that sees them clearer than us is God.
[03:14:07.699 --> 03:14:11.742]  You know, you can hide it from your spouse, your family, your friends, all of this.
[03:14:11.742 --> 03:14:15.045]  You can hide every aspect except from yourself.
[03:14:15.045 --> 03:14:16.606]  And you can run away from yourself.
[03:14:17.321 --> 03:14:18.942]  A lot of people do.
[03:14:18.942 --> 03:14:26.345]  Or they condemn themselves so harshly into immobility they just freeze up.
[03:14:26.345 --> 03:14:28.626]  Don't freeze up.
[03:14:28.626 --> 03:14:31.147]  Don't freeze up in fear.
[03:14:31.147 --> 03:14:35.668]  Unfortunately, I want to contrast a little bit of that today.
[03:14:35.668 --> 03:14:45.893]  Trauma driven by fear will definitely create a bunch of actions and reactions in the form of the flesh.
[03:14:45.893 --> 03:14:47.073]  Think about that for a moment.
[03:14:48.393 --> 03:14:50.634]  Powerful motivators, Trauma.
[03:14:50.634 --> 03:14:51.874]  Think about your own.
[03:14:51.874 --> 03:14:53.935]  I've spoken about mine in the past.
[03:14:53.935 --> 03:14:58.176]  I look at them in a different way today, though.
[03:14:58.176 --> 03:14:59.276]  You see?
[03:14:59.276 --> 03:15:01.257]  There's a different way to see that.
[03:15:01.257 --> 03:15:09.079]  You can get sucked into the victimization of it, whatever it was or whatever it is.
[03:15:09.079 --> 03:15:11.620]  Or, and I say this,
[03:15:12.631 --> 03:15:20.273]  Meaning it sincerely, you can in fact overcome it by recognition of what you aren't and what you are.
[03:15:20.273 --> 03:15:23.874]  And we identify too much with our thinking and our feeling.
[03:15:23.874 --> 03:15:27.555]  And people ask, you know, people will ask you, you'll know right away where they're at.
[03:15:27.555 --> 03:15:28.675]  They'll say, how do you feel?
[03:15:28.675 --> 03:15:32.776]  Or other people will say, what do you think?
[03:15:32.776 --> 03:15:40.117]  And you know, whether they're in their head or in their heart, not many people ask you, how do you think and how do you feel about it?
[03:15:40.117 --> 03:15:42.078]  You know, but, but that's okay too.
[03:15:42.873 --> 03:15:48.435]  Because we're usually only running half of the programming, our own programming even.
[03:15:48.435 --> 03:15:51.296]  So how are we going to interpret the rest of the world's programming?
[03:15:51.296 --> 03:15:52.296]  Or should we?
[03:15:52.296 --> 03:16:04.280]  Maybe we should interpret our own a little differently first, integrate a little bit better first, and then our filter changes and how we see our suffering and maybe we don't see suffering anymore.
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:08.241]  Maybe we can walk through what others say, oh, how horrible, how terrible.
[03:16:08.241 --> 03:16:10.082]  And we say, no, no, no, it's all right.
[03:16:11.505 --> 03:16:14.966]  Because we know how it ends, but we know what we're doing in it.
[03:16:14.966 --> 03:16:16.306]  We're not abandoning this.
[03:16:16.306 --> 03:16:21.227]  We're not walking through the valley of the shadow of death unaccompanied.
[03:16:21.227 --> 03:16:27.788]  We're there, in the middle of it, together, doing this thing, doing this dance.
[03:16:27.788 --> 03:16:31.629]  On January 6th, there's going to be a big dance in Washington, D.C.
[03:16:31.629 --> 03:16:33.909]  A bunch of people are going to be there.
[03:16:33.909 --> 03:16:35.369]  Go to the dance.
[03:16:35.369 --> 03:16:39.670]  Participate in the world that's around you, if you can.
[03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:40.130]  If you can.
[03:16:40.990 --> 03:16:57.174]  If you can't, hey, do your thing where you are, but do something that carries your heart, what you believe to be right and true, with your head, what you know to be right and true, and ask for a higher knowledge that can be funneled through you.
[03:16:57.174 --> 03:17:02.236]  You know, Alex was talking a couple hours ago about the church, how many churches missed the mark.
[03:17:04.108 --> 03:17:16.052]  If you listen carefully a couple thousand years ago, you heard a different version of the church as people were kicking in temple doors, or one in particular, and what was it?
[03:17:16.052 --> 03:17:17.792]  You are the church.
[03:17:17.792 --> 03:17:20.653]  Your body is that temple.
[03:17:20.653 --> 03:17:32.457]  Think about that as you wake up into the 21st century, into 2021, into the new year, because we're gonna have a happy new year because we find our power in it.
[03:17:33.149 --> 03:17:36.255]  And we express it in the world around us and change it.
[03:17:36.255 --> 03:17:36.956]  This is Dr. Nick.
[03:17:36.956 --> 03:17:37.557]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:40.896 --> 03:17:51.523]  It's not a secret why in leftist-controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S., they encourage people to live in tent cities as homeless and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime.
[03:17:51.523 --> 03:17:59.308]  It's because the globalists admit under Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, of course the Great Reset, they want to lower expectations.
[03:17:59.308 --> 03:18:01.689]  They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere.
[03:18:01.689 --> 03:18:04.431]  They don't want you to think of a civilization that gets better.
[03:18:04.431 --> 03:18:07.133]  They want you to think of a civilization that gets progressively worse.
[03:18:07.913 --> 03:18:09.674]  The globalists fly around in private jets.
[03:18:09.674 --> 03:18:11.816]  They have huge private estates.
[03:18:11.816 --> 03:18:13.397]  They are separate from us.
[03:18:13.397 --> 03:18:15.259]  Their children go to private tutors.
[03:18:15.259 --> 03:18:16.580]  They admit this.
[03:18:16.580 --> 03:18:24.586]  Now they want us locked down, telecommunicating with each other, so that we are not actually out physically building a pro-human infrastructure.
[03:18:25.046 --> 03:18:30.569]  The infrastructure that's left under 5G is meant to control robot autonomous cars and trucks.
[03:18:30.569 --> 03:18:32.309]  This is all their admitted plan.
[03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:36.732]  The public's finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta, it's gone operational.
[03:18:36.732 --> 03:18:38.192]  It's a post-human future.
[03:18:38.192 --> 03:18:39.353]  You better find out about it right now.
[03:18:40.765 --> 03:18:43.146]  The post-industrial world.
[03:18:43.146 --> 03:18:52.410]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[03:18:52.410 --> 03:18:56.892]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[03:18:56.892 --> 03:19:02.794]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[03:19:05.635 --> 03:19:08.658]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[03:19:08.658 --> 03:19:11.782]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[03:19:11.782 --> 03:19:13.744]  It is making the population poor.
[03:19:13.744 --> 03:19:19.671]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[03:19:19.671 --> 03:19:22.974]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding, and they're dystopic.
[03:19:23.935 --> 03:19:25.296]  Image.
[03:19:25.296 --> 03:19:29.238]  We are fighting this at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:29.238 --> 03:19:36.362]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[03:19:36.362 --> 03:19:37.242]  God bless you.
[03:19:37.242 --> 03:19:40.924]  Visit us, spread the word, at InfoWars.com.

[03:19:59.100 --> 03:20:00.641]  Ban.video.
[03:20:00.641 --> 03:20:04.144]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[03:20:04.144 --> 03:20:08.988]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:14.072]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[03:20:14.072 --> 03:20:18.735]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[03:20:18.735 --> 03:20:20.677]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:20:20.677 --> 03:20:25.120]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:35.727]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.Video.
[03:20:35.727 --> 03:20:36.648]  Share the link.

[03:20:43.425 --> 03:20:56.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:56.313 --> 03:21:03.197]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:21:03.197 --> 03:21:06.700]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:20.934]  So good to be back again on this Friday afternoon in most of the world and just before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:21:20.934 --> 03:21:24.976]  You know, just thinking about all of the just
[03:21:25.774 --> 03:21:28.955]  Total insanity, really, in the world.
[03:21:28.955 --> 03:21:31.515]  I mean, nothing is functioning as it should, correct?
[03:21:31.515 --> 03:21:32.576]  I mean, we all know that.
[03:21:32.576 --> 03:21:33.756]  We all see that.
[03:21:33.756 --> 03:21:40.617]  A lot of us predicted the model would happen and also predicted at the same time that there would be this transformation.
[03:21:40.617 --> 03:21:42.278]  Why do I know that?
[03:21:42.278 --> 03:21:51.560]  Because within the birth pains of living experience is something beautiful on the other end, but unfortunately in the earth we keep choosing
[03:21:52.552 --> 03:22:13.805]  This trauma trajectory, you know, and that's kind of the old model that's starting to get a little bit dismantled because people are speaking a little different messages now, you know, and not talking about the powerlessness of how we are, the dust and dirt that we are at the feet of a God that doesn't care and isn't our friend.
[03:22:13.805 --> 03:22:15.706]  That isn't how it is.
[03:22:15.706 --> 03:22:16.527]  It's the other way.
[03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:18.873]  It's the opposite way.
[03:22:18.873 --> 03:22:19.974]  You know, we're more than that.
[03:22:19.974 --> 03:22:28.761]  We're creating the image and likeness of a creator who stands in friendship with us, in a conversation with each of us, if we'll have it.
[03:22:28.761 --> 03:22:33.664]  And it doesn't come back in some, well, maybe for some it does, in an audible form.
[03:22:33.664 --> 03:22:35.926]  It comes in all different ways.
[03:22:35.926 --> 03:22:45.213]  And I've been in my deeper conversation recently, and a couple things that I realized about myself that I still have to overcome.
[03:22:46.047 --> 03:22:50.230]  You know, one of them is still a level of self-doubt.
[03:22:50.230 --> 03:22:54.432]  I mentioned it just before the break, this idea that I pray before I go on.
[03:22:54.432 --> 03:22:55.353]  I don't want to screw up.
[03:22:55.353 --> 03:22:56.274]  I don't want to say the wrong thing.
[03:22:56.274 --> 03:22:57.695]  This is called self-doubt.
[03:22:57.695 --> 03:22:58.835]  See?
[03:22:58.835 --> 03:22:59.996]  And I have some of that.
[03:22:59.996 --> 03:23:02.938]  So I, you know, I go, well, I can't overcome that one.
[03:23:02.938 --> 03:23:05.840]  And I really don't want to mess it up.
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:14.065]  So that's the conversation I have with my friend, who I hope will guide my words, you know, and does.
[03:23:14.065 --> 03:23:14.946]  I believe that.
[03:23:14.946 --> 03:23:15.266]  And so
[03:23:16.633 --> 03:23:17.473]  This is the thing.
[03:23:17.473 --> 03:23:19.034]  We all can have that conversation.
[03:23:19.034 --> 03:23:34.717]  And the other day, as I'm walking, because I walk in the dark, cold night of Alaska a couple times a day, and I'm in this conversation, and I realize, and I hear it, I hear it in my heart, actually, and it says, Nicholas, don't, don't worry.
[03:23:34.717 --> 03:23:37.638]  I'll work with you as flawed as you are.
[03:23:37.638 --> 03:23:38.498]  Just be available.
[03:23:39.358 --> 03:23:47.306]  Wow, that was a profound message that I'm passing on to all of you right now, because it's for all of you, not just for me.
[03:23:47.306 --> 03:23:49.789]  We need to remember that, as flawed as we are.
[03:23:49.789 --> 03:23:55.455]  And we see it better than anyone else, except God, so we hide it from everyone else to some degree.
[03:23:55.455 --> 03:23:57.056]  And that's okay, I understand.
[03:23:57.056 --> 03:24:01.381]  But someday, the veil will be removed and we'll see each other for who we are.
[03:24:02.142 --> 03:24:09.088]  And then that's the gnashing of teeth, you know, the grinding, you know, but it doesn't have to be that way because we can accept the flaws in each other.
[03:24:09.088 --> 03:24:12.831]  That's acceptance, what I've been talking about for weeks.
[03:24:12.831 --> 03:24:27.183]  Not tolerance, this lefty notion of shutting up what you believe to be right and true and just, you know, denying your truth by not speaking it and then eventually speaking some lie that you think you want the public wants you to hear.
[03:24:27.183 --> 03:24:28.304]  Don't do that.
[03:24:29.466 --> 03:24:30.286]  Don't do that.
[03:24:30.286 --> 03:24:33.287]  Don't start giving up what you believe to be right and true.
[03:24:33.287 --> 03:24:38.328]  You should find a way to intellectually and emotionally, you know, rationalize it for sure.
[03:24:38.328 --> 03:24:40.709]  And everyone does.
[03:24:40.709 --> 03:24:45.931]  If you're a woman living in Saudi Arabia wearing a black bag, I'm sure you got a good rationale for it.
[03:24:45.931 --> 03:24:46.831]  You feel good about yourself.
[03:24:46.831 --> 03:24:47.551]  You might even be happy.
[03:24:48.956 --> 03:24:55.521]  And if you're a woman in France walking on the beach without a top on, you might be happy and think that's perfectly fine.
[03:24:55.521 --> 03:24:59.724]  And you might not feel that way in the Midwest and Iowa on either situation.
[03:24:59.724 --> 03:25:09.412]  But the fact is, much of what we believe and feel, hmm, might want to think about that.
[03:25:09.412 --> 03:25:11.813]  Are they that important?
[03:25:11.813 --> 03:25:13.755]  Are they that meaningful?
[03:25:13.755 --> 03:25:14.976]  What do they really represent?
[03:25:16.002 --> 03:25:23.004]  Start going deeper inside and say, why do I believe what I believe and does it have any power in it or does it take power from me?
[03:25:23.004 --> 03:25:40.409]  You know, start asking ourselves the deep questions so we can find our individual power and begin to project it like a funnel of energy facing the other way, you know, taking who you are and making it like a laser of decision.
[03:25:42.216 --> 03:25:47.979]  A laser of decision, you know, each thing you decide creates the chain reaction that you live.
[03:25:47.979 --> 03:25:54.201]  Throw the pebble in the pond, you see it go in and you forget about all the waves that go on from it.
[03:25:54.201 --> 03:25:56.002]  Well, that's you in action.
[03:25:56.002 --> 03:25:58.864]  That's all of us in action together doing our thing.
[03:25:58.864 --> 03:26:06.487]  It's a beautifully orchestrated dance if you'll just participate in it on some level.
[03:26:07.837 --> 03:26:17.323]  And then you actually are united with the millions, maybe billions of other human souls, trying to do the same thing.
[03:26:17.323 --> 03:26:21.766]  And then we change the world, because we change how we relate to the world.
[03:26:21.766 --> 03:26:26.950]  So suffering ends for us when we don't see the suffering that comes at us in the same way.
[03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:31.833]  And you stand in the middle of the storm, what I've also talked about.
[03:26:31.833 --> 03:26:34.595]  Where it whirls around you, you see it all.
[03:26:34.595 --> 03:26:36.196]  You're even in it a little bit, you know.
[03:26:37.797 --> 03:26:38.137]  I don't know.
[03:26:52.102 --> 03:26:55.943]  You get to participate in the creation of it in a more powerful way.
[03:26:55.943 --> 03:26:56.983]  You'll do it anyway.
[03:26:56.983 --> 03:26:59.243]  You can do it robotically on your hamster wheel.
[03:26:59.243 --> 03:27:00.464]  We all have hamster wheels.
[03:27:00.464 --> 03:27:02.164]  I've seen giant ones in my life.
[03:27:02.164 --> 03:27:07.385]  You know, these guys who are really high places as we think and people who are in smaller places.
[03:27:07.385 --> 03:27:09.725]  But it's just another hamster wheel.
[03:27:09.725 --> 03:27:17.547]  And no matter how big it is in the earth, when God sees it from his perspective, it's just a little bitty hamster wheel.
[03:27:17.547 --> 03:27:18.987]  And most of us run around on those.
[03:27:19.853 --> 03:27:24.976]  And we engage what I call the window dressing of life, the issues that are important to us, which is important.
[03:27:24.976 --> 03:27:40.444]  I'm not diminishing any of that, but I'm saying do it on a platform of values and belief that's anchored in knowledge and truth and maybe funneled to the pursuit of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the happy new year that we're supposed to be having.
[03:27:40.444 --> 03:27:48.488]  And don't let globalists or people in the religious industry or others strip you
[03:27:49.568 --> 03:27:55.313]  of who you are and what you are and diminish you in some way or create some intermediary between you and the universal.
[03:27:55.313 --> 03:27:56.994]  There isn't one.
[03:27:56.994 --> 03:27:58.616]  You're in it.
[03:27:58.616 --> 03:28:00.197]  That's the big message.
[03:28:00.197 --> 03:28:00.597]  All right?
[03:28:00.597 --> 03:28:07.243]  For the beginning of the new year, we're all in this thing, not to hide out in our homes in a huddle.
[03:28:07.243 --> 03:28:08.103]  No, that's wrong.
[03:28:08.103 --> 03:28:10.485]  That's a false message, a false narrative.
[03:28:10.485 --> 03:28:18.512]  We're meant as human beings to be with each other, to embrace each other, to see each other's expressions.
[03:28:19.815 --> 03:28:28.078]  To hear the vibration in each other's voices in person, not just through the airwaves or the internet.
[03:28:28.078 --> 03:28:35.141]  There's something about being with someone and the way the energy exchanges with each of us.
[03:28:35.141 --> 03:28:39.342]  That's so fundamental to what we are.
[03:28:39.342 --> 03:28:42.264]  It's who we are.
[03:28:42.264 --> 03:28:48.426]  The energy we feel is what we are and the shell that feels it
[03:28:49.628 --> 03:28:54.831]  Carries it around in the earth and they're trying to shut that piece down.
[03:28:54.831 --> 03:28:58.133]  And we need to wake that piece up.
[03:28:58.133 --> 03:29:04.396]  And so in the middle of the storm, we need to learn how to be that.
[03:29:04.396 --> 03:29:06.617]  To feel that and the gratitude of it.
[03:29:06.617 --> 03:29:11.200]  I am grateful every day that I get to do what I do in this life.
[03:29:11.200 --> 03:29:13.981]  To breathe this breath of life with you.
[03:29:13.981 --> 03:29:15.722]  You know, when I think about what we're doing,
[03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:21.073]  And when we get it together like we do, what happens, you see?
[03:29:21.073 --> 03:29:30.898]  And no matter how it looks, no matter how it appears, you have to see a greater order in it.
[03:29:30.898 --> 03:29:41.024]  And have not, you know, this faith thing is so difficult, you know, because it's not like, oh, it's this magical thing.
[03:29:41.024 --> 03:29:43.785]  You just have to believe it and you don't.
[03:29:43.785 --> 03:29:45.386]  Well, that doesn't work, right?
[03:29:45.922 --> 03:29:48.965]  You gotta know what you know to believe what you believe.
[03:29:48.965 --> 03:29:54.170]  And so that's the foundation of faith from my perspective is doing what you know is right and true.
[03:29:54.170 --> 03:30:01.037]  Carrying your life message to the configuration of your spheres of influence, your family, your friends, the people that matter to you.
[03:30:01.994 --> 03:30:12.260]  And try and overcome yourself in the course of this, but not limit yourself by holding back what you can do, as flawed as each and every one of us are.
[03:30:12.260 --> 03:30:14.342]  That's the big one for the new year.
[03:30:14.342 --> 03:30:15.742]  Do what you can.
[03:30:15.742 --> 03:30:25.708]  Think about your cravings in life, and I'll talk a little bit about that after the break, because your cravings are also a signal of something that might be in the flesh that you might want to pay attention to.
[03:30:25.708 --> 03:30:26.909]  Is it drugs?
[03:30:26.909 --> 03:30:27.590]  Is it sex?
[03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:28.830]  Is it alcohol?
[03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:29.731]  What's your craving?
[03:30:39.238 --> 03:30:43.082]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[03:30:43.082 --> 03:30:47.405]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[03:30:47.405 --> 03:30:55.912]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:56.252 --> 03:31:12.884]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[03:31:12.884 --> 03:31:23.932]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[03:31:24.392 --> 03:31:32.902]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[03:31:32.902 --> 03:31:38.429]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:43.274 --> 03:31:45.656]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[03:31:45.656 --> 03:31:53.281]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[03:31:53.281 --> 03:31:57.183]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[03:31:57.183 --> 03:32:00.665]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[03:32:00.665 --> 03:32:03.087]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[03:32:03.087 --> 03:32:05.468]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[03:32:05.468 --> 03:32:07.290]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:13.692]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[03:32:13.692 --> 03:32:15.233]  Okay?
[03:32:15.233 --> 03:32:19.815]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[03:32:19.815 --> 03:32:22.116]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[03:32:22.116 --> 03:32:22.936]  These are real numbers.
[03:32:22.936 --> 03:32:24.197]  These are real facts.
[03:32:24.197 --> 03:32:31.580]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[03:32:32.081 --> 03:32:32.863]  Rebuke it.
[03:32:32.863 --> 03:32:34.048]  Stand up against it.
[03:32:34.048 --> 03:32:35.814]  This is slavery.
[03:32:35.814 --> 03:32:38.043]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[03:32:40.796 --> 03:32:42.136]  The Great Reset is here.
[03:32:42.136 --> 03:32:55.679]  World government has openly been announced and its plan is to bankrupt you and your family and to make you so poor you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income or sinoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system.
[03:32:55.679 --> 03:33:08.262]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active and get prepared for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need so you're not dependent on the system.
[03:33:08.462 --> 03:33:11.323]  We have the best durable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[03:33:11.323 --> 03:33:13.865]  All the other big competitors have already gone up on their prices.
[03:33:13.865 --> 03:33:17.787]  But our supplier has high quality food in stock ready to ship to you.
[03:33:17.787 --> 03:33:20.608]  And by January 8th, they're going to have to raise prices some.
[03:33:20.608 --> 03:33:21.709]  So take advantage now.
[03:33:21.709 --> 03:33:23.370]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:33:23.370 --> 03:33:29.032]  And on top of that, you can save up to $850 off their regular rates.

[03:33:31.133 --> 03:33:32.814]  You've got until January 8th.
[03:33:32.814 --> 03:33:38.077]  And the profit that comes in then helps fund the InfoWar, fighting for America, fighting for justice, fighting for freedom.
[03:33:38.357 --> 03:33:40.379]  A true 360 win.
[03:33:40.379 --> 03:33:43.581]  It's back in stock.
[03:33:43.581 --> 03:33:45.042]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[03:33:45.042 --> 03:33:48.144]  They couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[03:33:48.144 --> 03:33:49.445]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[03:33:49.445 --> 03:33:53.568]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[03:33:53.568 --> 03:33:59.553]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[03:33:59.553 --> 03:34:00.714]  It's amazing.
[03:34:00.714 --> 03:34:02.175]  Folks absolutely love it.
[03:34:02.175 --> 03:34:04.537]  And again, France has been shut down so that we couldn't get it.
[03:34:05.097 --> 03:34:07.739]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[03:34:07.739 --> 03:34:09.881]  25% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:34:09.881 --> 03:34:13.665]  Pollen Block again is available in this one-minute ad.
[03:34:13.665 --> 03:34:22.493]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and
[03:34:22.813 --> 03:34:24.234]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:35:00.822 --> 03:35:02.944]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:02.944 --> 03:35:04.885]  Because there is a war on.
[03:35:04.885 --> 03:35:06.466]  For your mind.
[03:35:06.466 --> 03:35:08.408]  With Nick Begich.
[03:35:13.889 --> 03:35:14.990]  It is the way it is.
[03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:21.798]  You know, in fact, one of my New Year's resolutions is to configure a team maybe here in Anchorage that'll work me to get that hundred hours out.
[03:35:36.173 --> 03:35:40.116]  And get it into the band dot video format where people can see it.
[03:35:40.116 --> 03:35:45.300]  Because there's a lot to be said about what's going on in the world and there's never enough time.
[03:35:45.300 --> 03:35:52.887]  I know it frustrates every single host on here because we're bombarded with information from every angle.
[03:35:52.887 --> 03:35:56.770]  And so we got to pick the angle, you know, the facet on the gem, if you will.
[03:35:56.770 --> 03:36:00.093]  You think about all the scintillating light coming off of a gemstone.
[03:36:00.593 --> 03:36:02.494]  That's what you've got in the info war.
[03:36:02.494 --> 03:36:09.638]  You've got a lot of lights on the same rock, you know, and hitting it from a lot of angles.
[03:36:10.442 --> 03:36:11.603]  And what's it about?
[03:36:11.603 --> 03:36:20.087]  It's about you, the Info Warrior, you know, and doing something that is extraordinary, engaging ourselves again.
[03:36:20.087 --> 03:36:28.171]  Well, the rest of the media, the mainstream, the lamestream media tries to put the world to sleep with their programming, which I've talked a lot about.
[03:36:28.171 --> 03:36:30.472]  You want to know what I think about all that?
[03:36:30.472 --> 03:36:31.893]  I've done the science on that.
[03:36:32.613 --> 03:36:38.196]  For the last 25 years on controlling the mind and what the media does with that.
[03:36:38.196 --> 03:36:39.097]  It's powerful.
[03:36:39.097 --> 03:36:43.239]  It's like to be ignored, ladies and gentlemen, if you can.
[03:36:43.239 --> 03:36:50.903]  And dig deep into your own knowledge and start being more discerning in what you're being pipelined.
[03:36:50.903 --> 03:36:56.966]  And make sure the pipeline is one that you, you know, moderate and control the throttle on.
[03:36:56.966 --> 03:36:59.627]  The pipeline of your info war.
[03:36:59.627 --> 03:37:00.608]  The one in your mind.
[03:37:01.127 --> 03:37:04.528]  The one for your mind, for your mind.
[03:37:04.528 --> 03:37:06.049]  That's the mid-place, you see?
[03:37:06.049 --> 03:37:09.069]  Emotion and mind, the mid-place.
[03:37:09.069 --> 03:37:11.170]  You can't touch them, you know, in the real sense.
[03:37:11.170 --> 03:37:13.191]  Thoughts, ideas, you know, emotions.
[03:37:13.191 --> 03:37:15.071]  How do you grab those?
[03:37:15.071 --> 03:37:22.314]  But they affect everything in the physical and, reflected upwards, everything in the spiritual.
[03:37:22.314 --> 03:37:24.574]  So it's the bridge.
[03:37:24.574 --> 03:37:29.896]  The info war is the bridge, you see, between the physical world
[03:37:30.743 --> 03:37:33.445]  And a different world of seeing.
[03:37:33.445 --> 03:37:37.067]  So here's the challenge for 2021.
[03:37:37.067 --> 03:37:42.090]  Let's bring heaven and earth into focus a little better.
[03:37:42.090 --> 03:37:47.033]  Through the vessels that we are in the physical form within the earth.
[03:37:47.033 --> 03:37:50.034]  Combining the left and the right brain.
[03:37:50.034 --> 03:37:54.777]  You know, the analytical and the creative.
[03:37:54.777 --> 03:37:59.160]  The male and the female, if you will, if you want to use that analogy, is the brain.
[03:37:59.989 --> 03:38:01.089]  You think about it.
[03:38:01.089 --> 03:38:10.651]  Most, most, not all, and I don't want to be a sexist here, but I'm going to say the truth of the matter is most women come at us and say, how do you feel?
[03:38:10.651 --> 03:38:14.912]  Most men come at us and say, what do you think?
[03:38:14.912 --> 03:38:28.335]  It's the way we're wired up, you know, but getting that wiring a little reorganized so men can think and feel and women can do in a more holistic way, a more full way, a more complete way as we were meant to be.
[03:38:29.524 --> 03:38:42.131]  Uh, in terms of using our brain, but once that comes into focus, in focus, now you can tune in to something deeper and universal.
[03:38:42.131 --> 03:38:46.173]  So you have to first, you know, kind of overcome yourself a bit.
[03:38:46.173 --> 03:38:49.854]  Uh, then you have to find forgiveness in that.
[03:38:49.854 --> 03:38:55.837]  There's lots of ways you can kind of think about that, but there's only a route to the finish line.
[03:38:55.837 --> 03:38:58.639]  So find yours, find your path to forgiveness.
[03:38:59.404 --> 03:39:11.054]  And then your power will start to come back as a created human being and you can overcome your flaws, your cravings, you know, because think about those cravings.
[03:39:11.054 --> 03:39:16.678]  If it's sex, it's the chemical reaction that occurs and actually hangs around for about four days.
[03:39:16.678 --> 03:39:24.465]  If you want to clear up your thinking, you know, you might wait four days and then decide if that's really a good relationship or not if you've made that decision.
[03:39:25.460 --> 03:39:28.403]  The other one is, you know, drugs and alcohol.
[03:39:28.403 --> 03:39:29.263]  You know, this is easy.
[03:39:29.263 --> 03:39:29.984]  It's seductive.
[03:39:29.984 --> 03:39:31.965]  You crave it.
[03:39:31.965 --> 03:39:33.586]  Got to be careful there.
[03:39:33.586 --> 03:39:35.688]  You know, it can take you somewhere where you don't want to go.
[03:39:35.688 --> 03:39:40.131]  Then you got to ask yourself, which drugs are you choosing and what do they do to you?
[03:39:40.131 --> 03:39:44.134]  So what are you doing with your energy that you're using that to moderate?
[03:39:44.134 --> 03:39:50.059]  Are you using a depressant to drag your energy down because you feel overcharged or the opposite?
[03:39:50.059 --> 03:39:51.720]  Something that peps you up?
[03:39:52.458 --> 03:39:59.981]  But these cravings are misdirected energy, you see, not knowing how to move that creative energy in a different direction.
[03:39:59.981 --> 03:40:01.262]  That's a challenge.
[03:40:01.262 --> 03:40:02.863]  That's what we have to overcome in the flesh.
[03:40:02.863 --> 03:40:10.846]  That's what all that discussion is all about and all the different things in the world we hear about if we care about such things.
[03:40:10.846 --> 03:40:14.068]  So this is important, finding the balance and all that.
[03:40:14.068 --> 03:40:16.729]  Now, I've talked about emotion, how powerful emotion is.
[03:40:17.290 --> 03:40:20.071]  Now think of all the traumatic emotions that are associated with trauma.
[03:40:20.071 --> 03:40:25.694]  Fear, anger, anxiety, jealousy, envy, grasping, grabbing.
[03:40:25.694 --> 03:40:31.417]  Those are all fear-based things about the flesh dying, which it does, and it doesn't like that.
[03:40:31.417 --> 03:40:33.418]  You know, it kind of likes to hang around.
[03:40:33.418 --> 03:40:37.380]  That's kind of the nature of living organisms.
[03:40:37.380 --> 03:40:41.642]  You know, that's why animals do what living organisms do.
[03:40:41.642 --> 03:40:45.804]  You know, they don't have a real decision-making process so much.
[03:40:46.833 --> 03:40:50.395]  As a reactionary process of doing.
[03:40:50.395 --> 03:40:53.317]  It all works pretty well and it all flows together pretty well.
[03:40:53.317 --> 03:40:56.278]  But humans, we get the choice interpretation.
[03:40:56.278 --> 03:41:00.080]  Most of the choices that take place are in our head.
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:02.682]  Not in the reality out of our head.
[03:41:02.682 --> 03:41:03.662]  Think about it.
[03:41:03.662 --> 03:41:05.403]  Most things we fear never happen.
[03:41:05.403 --> 03:41:08.605]  Most things we want to have happen and imagine never happen.
[03:41:08.605 --> 03:41:14.628]  So how much activity do we give power to that's just in our head and not in our doing?
[03:41:14.628 --> 03:41:15.329]  Way too much.
[03:41:16.067 --> 03:41:17.928]  How many times do we think of all?
[03:41:17.928 --> 03:41:19.509]  We think of all.
[03:41:19.509 --> 03:41:20.710]  Think of all.
[03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:23.011]  The reasons why we don't do something.
[03:41:23.011 --> 03:41:24.372]  And we rationalize it all.
[03:41:24.372 --> 03:41:26.513]  We've got all these great reasons because we're just.
[03:41:26.513 --> 03:41:27.213]  We're just.
[03:41:27.213 --> 03:41:27.874]  We're just.
[03:41:27.874 --> 03:41:28.914]  We're just.
[03:41:28.914 --> 03:41:29.615]  No!
[03:41:29.615 --> 03:41:30.975]  We're not just anything.
[03:41:30.975 --> 03:41:32.776]  We are something.
[03:41:32.776 --> 03:41:39.860]  More powerful than we realize if we would just realize the mustard seed of that.
[03:41:39.860 --> 03:41:41.861]  The grain of sand on the beach of that.
[03:41:41.861 --> 03:41:43.862]  And here it is.
[03:41:43.862 --> 03:41:44.663]  Simply again.
[03:41:45.879 --> 03:41:49.501]  Knowing what you believe to be right and true and acting on it.
[03:41:49.501 --> 03:41:54.404]  Or let me find another set of words in my notes that I wrote down because I wanted to quote it right.
[03:41:54.404 --> 03:41:58.726]  Now faith is the assurance of what we hope for.
[03:41:58.726 --> 03:42:01.227]  The certainty of what we do not see.
[03:42:01.227 --> 03:42:04.189]  The certainty.
[03:42:04.189 --> 03:42:05.730]  Wow!
[03:42:05.730 --> 03:42:07.311]  Are you certain?
[03:42:07.311 --> 03:42:08.671]  You don't feel that?
[03:42:08.671 --> 03:42:10.452]  Then don't worry about it.
[03:42:10.452 --> 03:42:11.393]  Let that one go.
[03:42:11.393 --> 03:42:14.234]  Someone else will have the faith for that certainty.
[03:42:14.234 --> 03:42:15.255]  Where's yours?
[03:42:16.013 --> 03:42:18.294]  That's where you start, not where you want to end.
[03:42:18.294 --> 03:42:19.554]  That's called a finish line.
[03:42:19.554 --> 03:42:21.115]  The race has to begin somewhere.
[03:42:21.115 --> 03:42:22.675]  Start now.
[03:42:22.675 --> 03:42:25.156]  Do what you believe to be right and true.
[03:42:25.156 --> 03:42:28.257]  Those are always the right steps, especially in the new year.
[03:42:28.257 --> 03:42:31.378]  As we launch the new year, you're at home.
[03:42:31.378 --> 03:42:32.638]  It's a day off.
[03:42:32.638 --> 03:42:40.701]  Hopefully a day to reflect and to be with your family and your friends.
[03:42:40.701 --> 03:42:44.142]  And here I am with you today because you are my family and friends.
[03:42:46.238 --> 03:42:50.540]  Because I'm sharing a lot of deep thought with you.
[03:42:50.540 --> 03:42:53.141]  This is what friendship is.
[03:42:53.141 --> 03:42:56.782]  You know, only I'm doing it in a one-way mirror, all right?
[03:42:56.782 --> 03:43:02.585]  I'm trusting you with what I'm saying and sharing it with you.
[03:43:02.585 --> 03:43:12.169]  And you're not in this conversation with me here physically and dropping to the same level and knowing we're talking to each other, but I know I am.
[03:43:13.866 --> 03:43:35.166]  And as we join in friendship this year, as a group, as the tip of the spear, as the Info War moves forward, we do it with tremendous power, as a united force within a force, an invisible force that takes us somewhere.
[03:43:35.166 --> 03:43:39.550]  If we just do that bit that we have the faith for,
[03:43:40.524 --> 03:43:51.829]  And a foundation of values to lay that faith on that can move us into the 21st century into 2021 with the power that we are.
[03:43:51.829 --> 03:43:56.131]  Because here's what I know about the whole configuration.
[03:43:56.131 --> 03:44:05.596]  If we can bring in the power, the non-traumatic peace, the peace where God defines
[03:44:06.633 --> 03:44:12.316]  Itself as love we bring that into the equation and I gotta tell you as a young child.
[03:44:12.316 --> 03:44:15.298]  I couldn't even Say it as a young man.
[03:44:15.298 --> 03:44:18.099]  I had difficulty expressing that word.
[03:44:18.099 --> 03:44:19.680]  I never heard it from my father.
[03:44:19.680 --> 03:44:30.206]  Although I knew it I Never heard it But I knew it It took me a lifetime to be able to say it to talk about it.
[03:44:30.206 --> 03:44:32.667]  Like we have been for this last 45 minutes
[03:44:35.014 --> 03:44:42.720]  But I ask you, if you're a man out there, find some contact with your emotional side a little bit.
[03:44:42.720 --> 03:44:45.642]  And find a way to love yourself so you can really love others.
[03:44:45.642 --> 03:44:47.344]  Because that's where it starts.
[03:44:47.344 --> 03:44:51.387]  And plug in to the universal love that allows you to find that.
[03:44:51.387 --> 03:44:53.749]  And ask for grace.
[03:44:53.749 --> 03:44:55.390]  It's free.
[03:44:55.390 --> 03:44:57.572]  Doesn't cost a penny.
[03:44:57.572 --> 03:44:59.113]  It's free for the asking.
[03:44:59.113 --> 03:45:04.237]  I once met someone that was feeling so diminished they wouldn't even pray for grace.
[03:45:05.316 --> 03:45:10.880]  If that's you, I'm praying for your grace right now in this very moment.
[03:45:10.880 --> 03:45:11.940]  Wake up!
[03:45:11.940 --> 03:45:15.323]  Find your power by the grace of God, literally.
[03:45:15.323 --> 03:45:18.985]  And stand in it.
[03:45:18.985 --> 03:45:23.228]  And immerse yourself in it on this very first day of the new year.
[03:45:23.228 --> 03:45:25.849]  And feel the love of it.
[03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:26.850]  Find that.
[03:45:26.850 --> 03:45:27.991]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:45:29.338 --> 03:45:36.680]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[03:45:36.680 --> 03:45:38.120]  We've got two different big sales.
[03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:44.542]  We've got Super Bowl Vitality, Turbo Force, and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[03:45:44.542 --> 03:45:50.823]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack, at 40% off.
[03:45:50.823 --> 03:45:54.424]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off.
[03:45:55.644 --> 03:45:59.907]  With free shipping and double patriot points, the best deal ever.
[03:45:59.907 --> 03:46:05.352]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[03:46:05.352 --> 03:46:08.094]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[03:46:08.094 --> 03:46:15.039]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that's more critical than ever.
[03:46:15.539 --> 03:46:22.064]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[03:46:22.064 --> 03:46:24.685]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[03:46:24.685 --> 03:46:31.010]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[03:46:31.010 --> 03:46:37.975]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden.
[03:46:37.975 --> 03:46:42.518]  And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[03:46:44.185 --> 03:46:47.652]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing.
[03:46:47.652 --> 03:46:52.761]  They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue.
[03:46:52.761 --> 03:46:57.028]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[03:46:58.400 --> 03:47:08.023]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:47:08.023 --> 03:47:12.144]  That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
[03:47:12.144 --> 03:47:18.626]  That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[03:47:18.626 --> 03:47:24.167]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can.
[03:47:24.167 --> 03:47:25.588]  So help me God.
[03:47:25.588 --> 03:47:26.348]  InfoWars.com
