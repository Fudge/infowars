[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]  [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Ladies and gentlemen of Australia, my name is Ricardo Bozzi and I am the National Leader of Australia 1.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.398]   *BOOM* In the coming days, weeks and months, disturbing rumours concerning the governance of our country will begin to circulate.
[00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:30.641]  These rumours will appear to be so incredible, so unlikely and even so ludicrous, that the only sensible response would appear to be to dismiss them out of hand.
[00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:35.223]  Some of these rumours will, in time, indeed prove to be false.
[00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:51.209]  Unfortunately, some will be true and be prima facie evidence of the despicable crimes of treason and sedition, and some even morally worse, by those at the highest levels of power in Australia.
[00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:10.966]   During this time, it is imperative you monitor closely the responses of those who comprise the polity, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, The military, the constabulary, the corporations, the media, academia and religious organisations.
[00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:17.812]  The case can already be made that many of these people are already a tainted of treason.
[00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:26.839]  But if any remain silent, in the face of an obvious attack on Australian sovereignty, they will have signed their own death warrants.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.640]  Remember them.
[00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:51.419]   From the Governor General and State Governors, Through Parliament, through all the courts including the High Court, through the Public Service, the Defence Force, the Police Forces, the Boardrooms, the Unions, the Charities, the Mainstream Media, Schools and Universities and finally even the Churches, Synagogues, Mosques, Temples and Lodges.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.302]  Remember their names and who they are.
[00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:58.745]  Remember what they said and what they did not say.
[00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:02.697]  Remember what they did, and what they did not do.
[00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:06.019]  Why and how has it come to this?
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.563]  Simply put, for decades now, we have been deceived by those whom we trusted.
[00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:18.988]  Slowly, the truth has been revealed by the tireless efforts of a few, and this has been a most difficult task.
[00:02:20.248 --> 00:02:25.472]  Some of you will have heard it said, sometimes you can't tell people, you just have to show them.
[00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:31.726]  And to put that in the Australian vernacular, some people just need to piss on the electric fence for themselves.
[00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.667]  Thankfully, enough of us are now awake to the lies.
[00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:37.888]  And our numbers continue to grow.
[00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.948]  Faster every day.
[00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.049]  So what should we do?
[00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.290]  Firstly, be calm.
[00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.210]  Know that we can and will win this war.
[00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.151]  Secondly, be united.
[00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.830]  No matter how many they send against us, they cannot defeat 25 million Australians who stand together as one.
[00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.872]  And simply say, in a clear, strong and unconquerable voice, no consent, no consent, no consent.
[00:03:09.872 --> 00:03:10.932]  Thirdly, be brave.
[00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:15.193]  Some of us might be hurt, and some of us might die.
[00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:21.034]  But if we truly seek liberty, we must win it for ourselves.
[00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.127]  Nothing worth winning is won cheaply.
[00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:27.167]  Fourthly, be good.
[00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:31.768]  We the people must win this war with non-violent, non-cooperation.
[00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:38.850]  Because the manner of our victory is of foundational importance to the future of Australia as a nation-state.
[00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.712]  We must win this war with such moral authority that we are able to win the peace that follows.
[00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:50.733]  Finally, when all is done, the guilty will be punished.
[00:03:52.225 --> 00:04:03.067]  We will deal with the traitors in a lawful manner, which after the reprehensible, coordinated malfeasance and violence that they have visited upon us, that will be more than they deserve.
[00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:12.209]  And we will do this because we, the common people of Australia, are and have always been so much more than the elites.
[00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.730]  We are better than they are.
[00:04:15.982 --> 00:04:22.067]  We have not and we will not sacrifice our decency and our humanity to win this war as they have done.
[00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:27.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to enter a period of history without precedent.
[00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:29.652]  A war for the world.
[00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:33.695]  And we, you and I, are on the front line.
[00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:35.497]  Be calm.
[00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:37.278]  Be united.
[00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.080]  Be brave.
[00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:40.761]  And be good.
[00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:51.686]  And finally, remember that we fight as GK Chesterton wrote, not because we hate what is in front of us, but because we love what is behind us.
[00:04:52.307 --> 00:05:09.747]  Thank you.

[00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:58.908]  [music]
[00:06:58.843 --> 00:07:05.843]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:17.843]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us as we kick off this live Sunday, September 26th, 2021 broadcast.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:31.604]  We have several special guests joining us today and the reason I'm focusing so much from Texas across the United States and throughout the world on Australia lately is because Australia is tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.665]  Australia is next year's news today.
[00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:45.487]   And what the globalists are doing in Australia, what they're doing in the UK, what they're doing in Canada, What they're doing in the European Union is the designed plan for here, in the globalist's own words.
[00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:53.914]  So, the hellish, permanent lockdown for a, quote, carbon tax is what is being established.
[00:07:53.954 --> 00:07:57.357]  Now, John Bowne is one of our great researchers and reporters.
[00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:02.281]  He puts together a lot of really compelling, informative reports that are critical to the future of humanity.
[00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:09.646]  And he put one together over the weekend that we're going to play here in just a moment that needs to be seen and needs to be shared.
[00:08:09.666 --> 00:08:17.288]  And then I've got some special guests I'm going to tell you about from Australia who are joining us as it's the break of dawn over there right now.
[00:08:17.728 --> 00:08:18.868]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:52.616]   But in his report, Bowne lays out the fact that the globalists admit, that's the big corporations, the big banks, That they are establishing and that they are setting up a corporate world government that through a chip under your skin in the future, but currently through a digital face scan, a digital hand scan, or an app on your phone, will tell you when you can leave your house, can tell you where you can go, can tell you what you can do.
[00:08:53.076 --> 00:09:16.539]   And MasterCard and all the other big credit card manufacturers and controllers All just came out and said, we're going to limit what you can buy and how you can sell and basically cut your card off when you buy something that's not good for the environment, unless you pay a carbon tax to the United Nations and the private banks that are setting this up.
[00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.660]  I mean, this is feudalism 2.0.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:26.243]  This is just absolute, total and complete tyranny.
[00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:32.053]  And the name of the report is, Tyranny is Just the Beginning.
[00:09:32.553 --> 00:09:36.715]  This tyranny is just the beginning, and it lays it all out.
[00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:38.635]  We're going to be playing it here in a moment.
[00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:44.377]  But first, I just want this to sink in to everybody.
[00:09:44.698 --> 00:10:18.196]   The magnitude, and I say this all the time, but just the absolute, sheer, historical magnitude of where we are right now and just let it sink in that a very predatory authoritarian world government is taking over and gaslighting the public and is in the process of establishing a worldwide ID to carry out the orderly impoverishment, enslavement, and then extermination of the vast majority of the human population.
[00:10:18.936 --> 00:10:30.256]   And so we're going to witness something on the scale Of human suffering and pain never before even seen or dreamt of on this planet.
[00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:32.377]  So that is coming up.
[00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:36.940]  And I just have all the other incredible side issues that feed into this.
[00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:43.525]  Like two federal boards, the top board said do not do booster shots, do not give under 16s the injections.
[00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:47.548]  And Pfizer just waved a wand and said we're in charge, you're going to do it.
[00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:49.389]  And is out there bragging that that's the case.
[00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:51.235]  That is coming up.
[00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:52.436]  This is quite the report.
[00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:55.037]  The tyranny is just the beginning.
[00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:59.660]  The tyranny you're already witnessing is just the beginning.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:11.226]  And then we're going to come back and get into all the latest news and information in our world that feeds back to the globalist program of destabilization and the shutdown of human society.
[00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:17.810]  So that is coming up here on the other side of this transmission.
[00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.423]   And then we have Ricardo Aussie that we just played a clip of in the first segment
[00:11:22.423 --> 00:11:30.701]   joining us. Here's the report Joe Biden's rambling misspoken speech at the United Nations
[00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:35.702]   was as Transparent as it was a veiled message to the international
[00:11:35.702 --> 00:11:40.342]   order and global health threat and and a global health threat Council
[00:11:41.704 --> 00:11:44.567]  Toward global COVID response.
[00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:46.289]  Vaccinating the world.
[00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.656]  Working with countries, technologies, to reduce the risk.
[00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:54.800]  Similarly, we know the bitter string of terrorism.
[00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.004]  The bitter sting of terrorism is real.
[00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.926]  Heroic, horrific violence.
[00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:01.469]  Climactic climate change.
[00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:04.753]  Ignoring his hand in the murder of 13 U.S.
[00:12:04.793 --> 00:12:13.285]  soldiers and an aid worker's family and the impending doom of replacement migration while betraying our oldest ally, France.
[00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:15.547]  Emmanuel Macron is officially fuming.
[00:12:15.847 --> 00:12:25.414]  He's, you know, he's not attending this UN summit, and we don't really know what the state of affairs is, even though they're sort of set to have some talk with Biden in the next few days.
[00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:30.678]  Biden's poorly coded message predicted more pandemics to control the population.
[00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:40.806]  Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere, and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic?
[00:12:41.664 --> 00:12:42.724]  For there will be another one.
[00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:46.766]  And signaled that the global carbon tax system is imminent.
[00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:56.831]  Will we meet the threat of challenging climate, the challenging climate we're all feeling, already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather?
[00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:09.502]   Or will we suffer the merciless march of ever-worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves, Rising seas.
[00:13:10.282 --> 00:13:13.043]  Agenda 2030, tyranny on steroids.
[00:13:13.683 --> 00:13:18.505]  The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a code red for humanity.
[00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:22.986]  We see the warning signs in every continent and region.
[00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:25.306]  Scorching temperatures.
[00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:27.467]  Shocking biodiversity loss.
[00:13:28.527 --> 00:13:30.948]  Polluted air, water, and natural spaces.
[00:13:31.969 --> 00:13:34.791]  And climate-related disasters at every turn.
[00:13:35.091 --> 00:13:45.978]  The climate change rhetoric will accelerate piggybacking on the COVID lockdowns as climate change hysteria will saturate the remainder of the Biden administration occupation.
[00:13:46.298 --> 00:13:49.760]  The climate crisis is not our fight alone, it's a global fight.
[00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:59.166]  The President believes that what's in the infrastructure package is an important down payment on addressing what he sees as a crisis in our climate.
[00:13:59.346 --> 00:14:05.551]  Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here.
[00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:07.734]  It's not going to get any better.
[00:14:08.354 --> 00:14:09.816]  Well, let me tell you why that won't happen.
[00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:14.836]   for example, say, well, you know, history tells us that he can make all the promises
[00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:18.755]   he wants for 2030, there's a good chance the Republicans will be back in power by then
[00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:19.755]  and change everything.
[00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:21.755]  Well, let me tell you why that won't happen.
[00:14:21.755 --> 00:14:28.035]   Because the major corporations of the world, including in the United States, are all moving
[00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:28.915]  in this direction.
[00:14:29.317 --> 00:14:34.520]  And no politician is going to turn them around once they've committed trillions of dollars to this endeavor.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.260]  That's just not going to happen.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:50.067]   The normalization of contact tracing via COVID-19 apps and the expansion of the IRS and its reach into everyone's bank account will ensure the implementation of a similar carbon credit tracking system.
[00:14:50.287 --> 00:14:54.470]  It will be known as a PCA, a personal carbon allowance.
[00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:03.476]  As a proposal was presented in the science journal Nature by four environmental experts as a means of reducing global carbon emissions.
[00:15:03.676 --> 00:15:18.045]   Paul Joseph Watson wrote, everyone would be issued with a carbon allowance card that would entail all adults receiving an equal tradable carbon allowance that reduces over time in line with national carbon targets.
[00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:23.947]  The authors make it clear that the program would be a national mandatory policy.
[00:15:24.207 --> 00:15:47.483]   Also, the uproar at the border where Border Patrol has made a record 1 millionth stop is merely the beginning as the State Department announced that it will increase its allotment of immigrants from 62,500 in the fiscal year of 2021 to 125,000 in 2022, while NGOs across the United States
[00:15:47.483 --> 00:15:53.102]   funnel the invasion into cities in red states, including Florida, Texas, Missouri and
[00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:59.043]   Georgia. Biden's approval will plummet, but that's all just part of the plan. We stand in my view
[00:15:59.043 --> 00:16:01.672]  at an inflection point in history.
[00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:08.873]   And I'm here today to share with you how the United States intends to work with partners
[00:16:08.873 --> 00:16:11.793]  and allies to answer these questions.
[00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:18.874]   I believe we, and particularly you, has an incredible window of opportunity to lead in
[00:16:18.874 --> 00:16:30.913]  shaping a new world order for the 21st century.
[00:16:30.827 --> 00:16:32.827]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:16:32.827 --> 00:16:39.827]  [Music]
[00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:44.827]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.381]  Okay, thank you for joining us on this Sunday edition.
[00:16:49.482 --> 00:16:52.544]  This happens a lot these days before I go on air.
[00:16:52.624 --> 00:16:54.386]  I get so angry I can barely do the show.
[00:16:55.336 --> 00:17:02.162]  And that's not good because I don't get to all the news and information, and it's not good because I'm our deal with the crew, and I apologize for that.
[00:17:02.602 --> 00:17:08.787]  But, you know, I do not apologize for being deeply upset with what's happening in the world today.
[00:17:10.068 --> 00:17:22.379]  We are living in such an incredibly dangerous and historic time, and we have a naked corporate world government abolishing every aspect of what is a free society.
[00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:49.567]   And we have large groups of people standing up and saying no and not going along, but they are met with just such a wall of corporate oppression and such a sea of lemming-like individuals going along with it that I shudder to think The world we're going to live in, not just our children, because you're not going to have to wait.
[00:17:49.627 --> 00:17:53.689]  You know, Grandpa said, if the world keeps going like this, it's going to be tough for your children.
[00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:58.950]  Well, now it's the time of my children, the time of your children, and you don't have to wait anymore.
[00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.470]  It's here.
[00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:08.373]  And like putting a pot of water on the stove and turning the flame up on high, it's going to bubble at the bottom.
[00:18:08.413 --> 00:18:09.754]  It's going to start getting hot.
[00:18:09.794 --> 00:18:10.834]  It's going to come to a boil.
[00:18:11.654 --> 00:18:13.655]  We now are starting to come to a boil.
[00:18:14.773 --> 00:18:31.748]  So we're already in fabulous levels of oppression and tyranny and surveillance and control and giant Ponzi scheme banks just printing out quadrillions in fiat currency that they give to themselves to then buy up all the infrastructure.
[00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:57.552]  And when they can't buy up every single piece of property, because some won't sell, they cut the world economy off with the global lockdown, so that they have a pretext to go in and force you to sell, and then to dictate to your family and yourself through the new carbon apps that are going to be on all the phones they've announced, and that all credit cards are connected to, to then artificially make you poor, so that you can be their slave.
[00:18:57.632 --> 00:19:02.794]  I mean, this is just absolute, total, and complete bondage that we're going into.
[00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:20.531]  And I saw an individual that has one of the independent nationalist populist parties, Ricardo Bossi, doing some good work over in Australia, speaking up against the level of absolute oppression they're under.
[00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:22.992]  That is the beta test the rest of the world.
[00:19:23.472 --> 00:19:27.554]  So I thought our focus on Australia would be really informative if we got him on with us.
[00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:32.756]  So it's sunrise where he's at and he'll be joining us.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:41.223]  From the other side of the world, coming up, the start of the next segment, AustraliaOneParty.com.
[00:19:42.364 --> 00:19:50.908]  And you can see his very important video that we've been really pushing and promoting, A War for the World at Man.Video.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.602]  So I look forward to having him on with us.
[00:19:55.042 --> 00:20:04.887]  And then we have some other folks, a political prisoner and others joining us later in the next hour who've been locked up for peacefully protesting against the ongoing lockdown.
[00:20:04.927 --> 00:20:07.909]  So there's the video of your TV viewer, a war for the world.
[00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.630]  Let me do this right now.
[00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:18.295]  Let me just hit some headlines for you on the whole COVID tyranny takeover, just to give you an idea of where we are currently at.
[00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:29.036]  Pfizer's CEO says CDC decision to boost boosters against recommendations of top scientist panels a very good idea.
[00:20:29.517 --> 00:20:31.117]  He said that on ABC News today.
[00:20:31.137 --> 00:20:32.418]  I'll read that to you again.
[00:20:32.438 --> 00:20:34.519]  You can see the video at Infowars.com.
[00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:45.205]  Pfizer's CEO says CDC's decision to push boosters against recommendations of top scientific panels a very good idea.
[00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:47.146]  A very good one, he said.
[00:20:49.602 --> 00:21:01.026]  Now that's the CDC panel and the FDA panel that are scientists and virologists who were put there under statutory law to basically make sure there's oversight.
[00:21:01.586 --> 00:21:02.647]  That has been overridden.
[00:21:04.548 --> 00:21:13.531]  And Fauci says, and Pfizer says, around Halloween, they're gonna announce, down to two-year-olds are gonna get the shot.
[00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:25.803]  Even though the FDA scientists quit that are over that, even though the CDC scientists have gone public, even though two FDA boards and a CDC board have come out and said, this vaccine isn't a vaccine.
[00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:26.384]  It doesn't work.
[00:21:26.444 --> 00:21:27.324]  The drug is failing.
[00:21:27.644 --> 00:21:30.526]  It's causing a lot of heart attacks and heart swelling and blood clots.
[00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:32.587]  And all these shots are really bad.
[00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:33.948]  And we need to pull these back.
[00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:37.890]  And England yellow carded the vaccine with their advisory group saying, pull it.
[00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.991]  But they still went forward.
[00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:40.632]  So it's the same story all over the world.
[00:21:41.252 --> 00:21:48.617]  Where this is happening, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the UK, Canada, the US, the regulators are all, whoa, this is really bad.
[00:21:50.418 --> 00:21:52.320]  They're like, you're just the top scientist.
[00:21:53.981 --> 00:22:02.286]  Even though these are pro-vax people, bought and paid for by big pharma, they've gone, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is going to discredit vaccines for generations.
[00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:06.970]  That's a quote by the chief scientist at the FDA that quit three weeks ago.
[00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.792]  And then the panels voted the way they said they should.
[00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:11.852]  And they got overridden.
[00:22:12.132 --> 00:22:24.181]  And that's why the two top scientists, number one, number two, at the FDA quit three weeks ago, is they were told, when the boards say this shouldn't be given, we're going to override them.
[00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:29.004]  They said, the political hack who's not even a doctor at the White House is going to override?
[00:22:29.024 --> 00:22:29.905]  They said, yes.
[00:22:30.405 --> 00:22:32.727]  And the head of Pfizer, he's your president.
[00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:33.747]  He's your God.
[00:22:33.807 --> 00:22:34.568]  He's your doctor.
[00:22:34.588 --> 00:22:36.830]  But you know your doctor can't make you do something.
[00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.470]  He can.
[00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.431]  And he is.
[00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:51.891]  So that's why Fauci came out three weeks ago when those two FDA scientists quit and said, well, that's nice, but it will be approved and you will give it to babies as well.
[00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:56.634]  Because he knew they don't care.
[00:22:56.854 --> 00:22:57.795]  They run things.
[00:22:57.935 --> 00:22:58.675]  It's tyranny.
[00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:05.399]  They know that the vaccine creates a spike protein in your body that is what is the COVID-19 and makes you sick.
[00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:08.462]  They know it causes autoimmune disorders.
[00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:23.073]  They know people that take two to three shots of this garbage within a cold season or two, or three max, will come in contact with a regular coronavirus and have a horrible autoimmune attack.
[00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:28.947]  Again, they used to grow, starting in the 70s, some vaccines on peanut protein.
[00:23:29.487 --> 00:23:33.449]  And you got millions of people, for the first time in history, violently allergic to peanuts.
[00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:36.749]  The first time, after they had the inoculation, they'd get a little sick.
[00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:42.071]  But mom would feed it to them over and over again, and finally, if they took a bite of peanut, they'd die.
[00:23:42.491 --> 00:23:43.091]  It's the same thing.
[00:23:44.792 --> 00:23:46.112]  And I've had scientists on to describe it.
[00:23:46.132 --> 00:23:57.436]   There's a bunch of different disorders, but they could never make a cold Virus vaccine, that's what this is, because there's too many of them and it makes your body later freak out, just like a bee sting.
[00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:00.597]  That's your body having an immune response.
[00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:09.660]  And so, that's why the scientists say within two to three years, you're going to see mass death just from the autoimmune response.
[00:24:11.547 --> 00:24:21.137]  That's what killed most people with the Spanish flu back during the end of World War I was not the virus, but just the body's incredible overreaction to it, freaking out.
[00:24:21.217 --> 00:24:28.384]  That's why with COVID-19 you take steroids, inhalable and quark-atypic pills, anti-inflammatory.
[00:24:29.352 --> 00:24:34.953]  And that's why it deals with it most of the time if it's early, because it's an autoimmune response.
[00:24:35.293 --> 00:24:39.974]  Well, if you think that's bad, you wait down the road, and they know this!
[00:24:40.154 --> 00:24:48.456]  And then even the FDA scientists and CDC scientists and UK scientists are like, hey, we better, EU scientists, we better not do this, we better stop!
[00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:51.637]  They're like, shut up with your boards that used to be in charge!
[00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.578]  Pfizer and Moderna, that's DARPA, they say full speed ahead!
[00:24:57.054 --> 00:24:58.657]  And oh, and talk about Australia.
[00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:02.823]  They're under lockdown for like 500 and something days.
[00:25:03.604 --> 00:25:04.065]  Coming up on 600.
[00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:06.488]  And that's what's coming here next.
[00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:10.354]  Australia is tomorrow's tyranny today.
[00:25:11.275 --> 00:25:12.357]  This is hardcore.
[00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:12.698]  Stay with us.
[00:25:16.244 --> 00:25:16.965]  Big Brother.
[00:25:17.945 --> 00:25:19.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:25:20.267 --> 00:25:21.408]  Government cover-ups.
[00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:23.509]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.411]  Well, so does he.
[00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:30.955]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:43.456]  All right it is 7 30 a.m in the morning in Sydney Australia one of the locked down areas there in southern Australia and Ricardo Bossi is the real deal.
[00:25:43.636 --> 00:25:53.905]   He was a commander nationally of the SAS during the whole Kuwait operations and he is a He's a well-known corporate advisor and leader in Australia.
[00:25:53.925 --> 00:25:59.729]  I'm not going to go over it all, but he heads up Australia One Party, AustraliaOneParty.com.
[00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:06.934]  And I was already familiar with who he was because I follow world politics all over the planet, but especially, quote, Western-style countries.
[00:26:06.954 --> 00:26:09.296]  And I've certainly wanted to visit Australia before.
[00:26:09.316 --> 00:26:10.236]  I have a lot of listeners there.
[00:26:10.617 --> 00:26:17.742]  But then I saw a very powerful video that we put out last week with added pieces of news and video clips.
[00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:23.586]   of a statement he made about the fact that there is a war happening right now for the world.
[00:26:23.586 --> 00:26:31.665]   You can see that report at van.video right now, a war for the world. And again, Greg Rees,
[00:26:31.665 --> 00:26:35.186]   one of our great editors added some video and context to what he was saying. But
[00:26:35.186 --> 00:26:37.665]  Australia is where we're going to be.
[00:26:37.802 --> 00:26:39.525]  It's where Canada already is partially.
[00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:40.406]  It's where Europe is.
[00:26:40.927 --> 00:26:42.589]  And I have Klaus Schwab's own documents.
[00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:47.477]  I have Bill Gates' own documents where they admit this is their planetary takeover.
[00:26:47.517 --> 00:27:04.454]   But Ricardo Bossi with his whole Special Forces background and global connections has really great gravitas to speak to this, and specifically with the terrible things the Australian police are doing, now backed up by the military.
[00:27:04.814 --> 00:27:09.596]  This is basically a once-free, beautiful nation turning into North Korea, in my view.
[00:27:09.876 --> 00:27:11.497]  And again, it's the same global forces doing it.
[00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:13.417]  So thank you for joining us, Ricardo.
[00:27:13.617 --> 00:27:14.518]  It's great to have you here.
[00:27:14.918 --> 00:27:18.179]  And please give us the latest of what's happening to the land down under.
[00:27:20.137 --> 00:27:20.537]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:23.279]  Thank you very much for your kind invitation.
[00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:29.362]  And before we kick off, let me just thank you for your fearless and heroic pursuit of the truth.
[00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:31.784]  It's been nearly three decades for you.
[00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:33.745]  So this has been a long haul.
[00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:35.066]  So thank you so much.
[00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:37.007]  So what's happening down, down under?
[00:27:37.847 --> 00:27:43.710]  What you're witnessing is the rebirth of a moral, sovereign and self-reliant nation.
[00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.292]  We've got to focus on this the right way.
[00:27:47.353 --> 00:27:48.673]  We know exactly what's going on.
[00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:52.994]   Look, as a soldier, I always ask people a simple question.
[00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:59.795]  Is the history of mankind, the history of peace, punctuated by war or is it the history of war punctuated by peace?
[00:28:00.355 --> 00:28:06.397]  And depending on how you answer that question will reveal to you your view and knowledge of history.
[00:28:06.897 --> 00:28:15.839]  Now, I'm a soldier so I know that the history of mankind is constant war punctuated by periods of peace because the right people step up and do the right thing.
[00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:23.655]   So please understand what you are witnessing, what the world is witnessing, Is the rebirth of a moral, sovereign, and self-reliant nation.
[00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.075]  It's as simple as that.
[00:28:25.115 --> 00:28:25.655]  Now it's hurt.
[00:28:26.135 --> 00:28:26.735]  It's going to hurt.
[00:28:27.035 --> 00:28:28.636]  There's going to be some pain.
[00:28:29.156 --> 00:28:32.556]  But if we see this the right way, we'll see exactly what the opportunity is.
[00:28:32.596 --> 00:28:35.637]  The moment we get fearful, the moment we think we're going to lose, we lose.
[00:28:36.397 --> 00:28:37.937]  The moment we know we're going to win, we win.
[00:28:37.977 --> 00:28:39.618]  Because that's what happens in a fight.
[00:28:40.658 --> 00:28:43.038]  There's two boxes going at it.
[00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:45.559]  And the one that decides it's going to lose, does.
[00:28:46.522 --> 00:28:47.382]  Well, we're not doing that.
[00:28:47.462 --> 00:28:48.683]  We know exactly what we're doing.
[00:28:48.723 --> 00:28:49.323]  We have a plan.
[00:28:49.363 --> 00:28:50.184]  We're working the plan.
[00:28:50.224 --> 00:28:51.404]  We're being very careful about it.
[00:28:52.184 --> 00:29:06.090]  But the way I described it in that piece was non-violent, non-cooperation, the moral victory that we need to have in Australia and show the rest of the world what can and must be done.
[00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.771]  And so there's a short intro.
[00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:13.173]  This is a war without doubt, but it is the rebirth of our nation.
[00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:15.499]  Well, you're right, it's the rebirth.
[00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:17.401]  I totally agree with you, because the globalists say that.
[00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:28.010]  They say Bolsonaro, the awakening in Europe and the US and the UK and Brexit, and Australia demanding its liberty, and nationalist and patriot parties gaining more and more support.
[00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:37.458]  This whole worldwide lockdown, Operation Lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation and the UN, in their own admission, is to counter the populist uprising they see happening.
[00:29:37.978 --> 00:29:43.361]  And so we have to see this as an opportunity, and as the old corrupt system in crisis.
[00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:44.062]  I agree with you.
[00:29:44.102 --> 00:29:48.524]  So, I get up here and list all these terrible, scary things, and sometimes people think I'm trying to scare folks.
[00:29:48.564 --> 00:29:52.887]  No, I believe that once people are faced by the evil, they'll want to stand up and do something about it.
[00:29:54.628 --> 00:29:55.408]  And that's exactly it.
[00:29:55.428 --> 00:30:03.833]  And this is where the globalists have misread the Australian people, because they think the Anglophone world is this amorphous mass that responds identically, and we don't.
[00:30:03.893 --> 00:30:04.874]  We're very, very different.
[00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:10.401]  And what they see as complacency in the Australian people is actually just a resilience.
[00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:15.523]  This is a hard country, and you've got to be hard to take it, and you can't afford to jump at every shadow.
[00:30:16.103 --> 00:30:22.185]  And so they see this complacency as, they see our lack of movement as complacency.
[00:30:22.305 --> 00:30:22.665]  It's not.
[00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:23.546]  It's just resilience.
[00:30:24.006 --> 00:30:25.847]  We are slow to anger as a people.
[00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.247]  We are very slow to anger.
[00:30:28.187 --> 00:30:29.368]  We're very tolerant people.
[00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:36.554]  But I can tell you when an Australian gets their blood up, it'll start and we're beginning to see it now.
[00:30:36.915 --> 00:30:39.975]  Now, the key point here is we have to win this for ourselves.
[00:30:40.015 --> 00:30:41.616]  We can't outsource this any further.
[00:30:43.016 --> 00:30:48.937]  And just like the analogy I use when I'm talking to my people is it's similar to D-Day.
[00:30:49.357 --> 00:30:50.658]  We have to take Normandy.
[00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:54.799]  Now, the day we land on Normandy, we're going to need a lot of troops.
[00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:58.100]  I don't care how good your six people are.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.581]   You can't take Normandy beaches With six people.
[00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:02.602]  You need big numbers.
[00:31:02.642 --> 00:31:06.043]  And the analogy I use is, if a thousand turn up, we have a problem.
[00:31:06.083 --> 00:31:08.143]  If 10,000 turn up, the police have a problem.
[00:31:08.163 --> 00:31:10.944]  If 100,000 turn up, then the politicians have got a problem.
[00:31:10.964 --> 00:31:12.145]  If a million turn up, we win.
[00:31:12.365 --> 00:31:15.386]  Because there are not enough police, there are not enough prisons to lock us up.
[00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:17.726]  So we've got to take Normandy Beach.
[00:31:17.786 --> 00:31:21.607]  Now, having taken the beach doesn't mean that we're going to be in Berlin by next week.
[00:31:22.428 --> 00:31:26.569]  This has been an exquisitely designed and executed strategy over decades.
[00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:29.942]  Decades and decades and decades, and we have evidence of that.
[00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:33.603]  Just like you have evidence, we'd like our evidence too.
[00:31:34.063 --> 00:31:43.265]  There's a document from 1980 from the Australian Senate, a Senate inquiry into the implications for Australia of the new international economic order.
[00:31:43.805 --> 00:31:46.386]  And the book is quite clear.
[00:31:46.426 --> 00:31:54.966]   The report they wrote, February 1980, That we are fully engaged, the Australian nation apparently is fully engaged, and they're going to use every tool at their disposal.
[00:31:55.326 --> 00:32:03.550]  Personalities, the news media, the unions, everybody has to promote this new international economic order, which as you know, which was just one of the steps down the path.
[00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:14.675]  And so this very delicately, very exquisitely designed and executed strategy has penetrated every aspect and every arm of the government.
[00:32:15.552 --> 00:32:17.373]  And so it's going to take us time to get through this.
[00:32:17.914 --> 00:32:21.696]  But once we get on that beach at Normandy, that's the toehold.
[00:32:21.797 --> 00:32:23.478]  Once we get there, we start moving across.
[00:32:23.518 --> 00:32:24.599]  And the people are learning that.
[00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:32.564]  And to quote a famous American, Oliver Wendell Holmes, their hearts are being touched with fire.
[00:32:33.105 --> 00:32:37.488]  For the first time, the Australian people have to fight for their country on their land.
[00:32:37.988 --> 00:32:39.549]  Now, that's common around the world.
[00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:40.170]  It really is.
[00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.070]  But for us, no.
[00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.512]  We've been, we're very fortunate.
[00:32:44.255 --> 00:33:18.418]   Now the upside of having a good quiet life is it doesn't make for the toughest of people but they are learning fast and that that fire that's touching the Australian hearts the rest of the world can see what we are doing and we will win this peaceably and we must because if if we had the arms which were taken from us courtesy of one of our Prime Ministers after what has been called the false flag operation of Port Arthur The damage it would do to us as a nation to take up arms against each other is something we don't necessarily want.
[00:33:19.398 --> 00:33:27.943]  So we want to do this peaceably and we want to do this morally because that will allow us to win the peace that follows and this is just as critical to winning this war.
[00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:30.304]  Now we're going to win this war, of that I have no doubt.
[00:33:30.844 --> 00:33:33.445]  We have the numbers, we have the strategy, we have the plan, we have the people.
[00:33:34.186 --> 00:33:39.428]  We can win this because they cannot win without our consent and we're waking up.
[00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:46.083]   But once the war is won, We need to immediately transition into rebuilding and reforming this nation.
[00:33:46.443 --> 00:33:47.864]  And Australia has already got that plan.
[00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:48.505]  We're working on it.
[00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:49.786]  We've been working on it for some time.
[00:33:50.147 --> 00:33:54.191]  So this seamless transition from water peace is what we're working on.
[00:33:55.092 --> 00:33:58.215]  So it's going to be a great example for the rest of the world to follow.
[00:33:58.235 --> 00:34:00.017]  Because as you say, I think you're right.
[00:34:00.678 --> 00:34:01.699]  We are the test case.
[00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:04.041]  But the globalists have misread us badly.
[00:34:05.488 --> 00:34:14.596]  For an intelligent and well-designed plan, these buffoons, these imbeciles, these moral crittens have misread their adversary badly.
[00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:16.178]  They should read a bit of Sun Tzu, I think.
[00:34:16.198 --> 00:34:20.161]  They've misread Australia and they've misread the world and they will lose.
[00:34:20.221 --> 00:34:21.142]  It's only a matter of time.
[00:34:21.903 --> 00:34:24.785]  When we come back, Ricardo Bossi, AustralianOneParty.com.
[00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:31.245]  Is going to continue to lay out what's really happening in Australia and again the rest of the world because this is a test.
[00:34:31.606 --> 00:34:33.148]  The UN admits it.
[00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:34.269]  It's in all their statements.
[00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.491]  So is Europe.
[00:34:35.531 --> 00:34:36.292]  So is the UK.
[00:34:36.312 --> 00:34:37.052]  So is Canada.
[00:34:38.054 --> 00:34:39.516]  And you're now seeing this come here.
[00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:41.698]  So we're going to talk about the fact that this is globalist.
[00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:48.647]  And if the people of Australia or America or anywhere else understand this is an outside foreign takeover, they will unify against it.
[00:34:49.088 --> 00:34:54.455]  But when it gets to like puppets like Biden or their public prime minister there, you have to understand they're just front people.
[00:34:54.755 --> 00:34:59.181]  We must unify and understand the lockdowns are directed by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:16.500]  They are the enemy.
[00:35:16.578 --> 00:35:17.279]  Where's the veterans?
[00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:18.140]  Where's the generals?
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.043]  Well, look at Bolsonaro taking his country back and saying we're under globalist attack.
[00:35:22.344 --> 00:35:23.485]  They control Big Pharma.
[00:35:23.505 --> 00:35:24.466]  They're trying to enslave us.
[00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:26.495]  That's really what's happening.
[00:35:26.655 --> 00:35:28.236]  Trump did that to a certain extent.
[00:35:28.776 --> 00:35:32.056]  Boris Johnson acted like he was a patriot, but turned out to be a double agent.
[00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:33.797]  Maybe they had too much dirt on him.
[00:35:33.817 --> 00:35:36.457]  But Ricardo Bossi is a great leader over in Australia.
[00:35:36.477 --> 00:35:37.378]  He's the type of man they fear.
[00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:47.240]  He's an author, speaker, consultant, and former Australian Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel, having successfully been selected for the Australian Special Air Services Regiment.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:56.544]  Ricardo went to be appointed National Commander of Australian SAS Forces in Kuwait as well as the Director of Future Capability Development in Headquarters Special Operations amongst others.
[00:35:56.924 --> 00:36:04.527]  So just like General Flynn here fighting back as well because he sees a threat, as well as consulting and it goes on from there and all the things advising the military, the Australian government.
[00:36:04.547 --> 00:36:09.029]   So he's in a perfect position to say to the police and military, What are you doing?
[00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:15.093]  But notice it's leftist controlled cities that are showing the example for the rest of Australia, and then the example of the world.
[00:36:15.153 --> 00:36:20.276]  Just like leftist cities have done some similar things here, but the rebellion was so great they had to back off.
[00:36:20.336 --> 00:36:22.518]  So, laying this out, I want to explain to everybody.
[00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:26.702]  Australia is tomorrow's tyranny today.
[00:36:27.422 --> 00:36:29.383]  This is an exact blueprint, as you've already laid out.
[00:36:29.743 --> 00:36:31.543]  That's why their fight is our fight.
[00:36:32.084 --> 00:36:34.424]  So this isn't like, oh, we just care about Australia.
[00:36:34.624 --> 00:36:36.705]  No, I care about my family and the country and the whole world.
[00:36:37.065 --> 00:36:40.546]  And we defeat the globalists in one Western country, we'll defeat them everywhere.
[00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:43.867]  Or if Australia falls like dominoes, we will fall.
[00:36:44.367 --> 00:36:46.508]  So, Colonel, please continue laying this out for people.
[00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.269]  Sure.
[00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:56.017]  Just before you left the last segment, you mentioned about the leadership of the Western world being puppets, and you're exactly right.
[00:36:56.357 --> 00:37:04.987]  And it is a little frustrating hearing people say Biden said this and Morrison did that and Dan Andrews, who's our Victorian Premier, which is like your state governor.
[00:37:05.547 --> 00:37:08.234]   These people Couldn't find a beer in a brewery.
[00:37:08.254 --> 00:37:10.215]  I mean, they're so grossly incompetent.
[00:37:10.255 --> 00:37:10.715]  Exactly.
[00:37:11.015 --> 00:37:18.897]  And so even the language that people use when the mainstream media and even the critics of the leadership use their names.
[00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:19.978]  It's not them.
[00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.038]  They are puppets.
[00:37:21.098 --> 00:37:21.998]  We know they're puppets.
[00:37:22.438 --> 00:37:23.159]  They're imbeciles.
[00:37:23.499 --> 00:37:24.399]  It's the party machine.
[00:37:24.439 --> 00:37:26.279]  And behind the party machine, you've got the backers.
[00:37:26.299 --> 00:37:28.180]  And behind the backers, you've got the real power brokers.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.981]  And as you know, there are several layers.
[00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:34.982]  So we've got to really build a cat here and understand that these fools aren't running the show.
[00:37:35.898 --> 00:37:42.403]  And the way I put it to our people, because what they are doing to us in a real sense, is they want to foment a rebellion.
[00:37:43.423 --> 00:37:44.904]  And they're very good at this.
[00:37:44.944 --> 00:37:48.307]  They want us to react in a violent way.
[00:37:48.547 --> 00:37:49.908]  That's exactly what they're after.
[00:37:49.928 --> 00:37:52.529]  That'll give them the excuse to get even more violent.
[00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:57.993]  Now, in analysing an enemy's actions, you try to see some underlying logic.
[00:37:58.053 --> 00:37:59.654]  And there is one, but it's not obvious to them.
[00:38:00.114 --> 00:38:02.536]  Because people keep saying to me, why are the police so rough?
[00:38:02.576 --> 00:38:07.079]   Why are they bashing up Women on the street.
[00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:09.920]  Why are they spraying old ladies in the street?
[00:38:11.101 --> 00:38:12.342]  They want the response.
[00:38:12.762 --> 00:38:15.664]  The globalists want us to push back in a violent way.
[00:38:16.344 --> 00:38:20.027]  Once that happens, they will come down even harder.
[00:38:21.207 --> 00:38:22.808]  It is as clear as day.
[00:38:22.828 --> 00:38:27.051]  And that's why our whole response must be predicated on nonviolent non-cooperation.
[00:38:27.311 --> 00:38:28.492]  Because we can bring them to a halt.
[00:38:29.387 --> 00:38:38.189]  24 million people, and let's say there's a million crooks in the place, at least 24 million of us, which is less than a tenth of the United States population, but about the same area.
[00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:49.152]  If we just stood and said no, we just refused to play the game, we'll still be law-abiding citizens, we'll still do what we've got to do, but we just won't play the game anymore.
[00:38:49.312 --> 00:38:50.652]  There's not enough police to help.
[00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:54.954]  Now the other good part is the police are cracking, and so are the doctors and so are the lawyers.
[00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:56.634]  The wedge has started.
[00:38:57.586 --> 00:38:59.808]  And so once again, the globalists have missed out.
[00:38:59.948 --> 00:39:01.730]  They're trying to foment this rebellion.
[00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.772]  And so subtle is their plan.
[00:39:05.293 --> 00:39:11.077]  For example, the idea of a corporate entity, which is Australia and a corporate entity, which is the Queen of Australia.
[00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:12.839]  There is some truth to that.
[00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:18.063]  There's also a lot of misinformation because they're trying to G up all sorts of different responses to it.
[00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:24.749]  And so what we try to do is we try to stay above the nonsense detail and just focus on what's got to be done.
[00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:28.243]  And what's got to be done is that people have to, we've got to build our army.
[00:39:28.683 --> 00:39:34.186]  And my people get tired of hearing me say, you've got one priority folks, build the army, build the army, build the army.
[00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:45.155]   So when the word comes down and we land on the beaches of Normandy, we just flood every square inch With peaceful Australians saying, no consent, no consent, no consent.
[00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:47.417]  And Mr. Bossie, let's explain how this works.
[00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:49.198]  For people that don't know, you're historically totally right.
[00:39:49.558 --> 00:39:56.924]  Because we put your video out, it got 600,000 views on our site, 500,000 views, and millions around the web once we amplified it.
[00:39:56.944 --> 00:39:58.145]  It was already popular in Australia.
[00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:00.547]  And fools saw it and said one of two things.
[00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:02.208]  Yeah, he's right, let's start killing.
[00:40:02.689 --> 00:40:06.092]  Or they said, oh look, he's like you, he's trying to get people to be violent.
[00:40:06.132 --> 00:40:06.892]  No, you were very clear.
[00:40:07.253 --> 00:40:09.454]  You said no consent, no consent, no consent.
[00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:10.735]  Mahatma Gandhi.
[00:40:11.636 --> 00:40:12.737]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.237]  copying Jesus Christ.
[00:40:15.057 --> 00:40:16.338]  That is what we're talking about.
[00:40:17.058 --> 00:40:25.942]  And then when they crack the heads, it hurts them not getting a physical war going, which destabilizes and collapses the country for several years.
[00:40:26.382 --> 00:40:30.144]  Then they come in as the savior, overthrow the government, and the globalists put in their new government.
[00:40:30.404 --> 00:40:32.405]  Klaus Schwab has written books on this.
[00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:33.605]  The UN talks about it.
[00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:43.530]   We got IMF World Bank documents in 2002, the BBC did, Greg Palast, where they were planning all over the world to foment Revolutions they controlled that then collapse things.
[00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.372]  They'll put a communist revolution in for 10 years and then bring in something after it.
[00:40:48.272 --> 00:40:49.853]  So that's what they're trying to do.
[00:40:50.153 --> 00:40:59.399]  We have to understand the larger plan, unify Americans, unify Australians, unify all countries against the corporate globalists using simple behavioral psychology.
[00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:02.941]  So we pull up at the 30,000 foot view, we'll then understand it.
[00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:07.143]  But if we keep just thinking, bring a new puppet in, bring a puppet out, we're going to continue to fail.
[00:41:07.203 --> 00:41:09.725]   We've got to see The whole hidden image.
[00:41:09.745 --> 00:41:11.706]  And once we see the image, you can't unsee it.
[00:41:11.726 --> 00:41:12.386]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:41:13.746 --> 00:41:14.467]  Exactly correct.
[00:41:14.507 --> 00:41:14.827]  Thank you.
[00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:15.787]  You put that very well.
[00:41:16.328 --> 00:41:22.731]  And that's why one of our primary objectives, once part of our plan to reform the nation.
[00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:30.154]  And let me just read this to you because this is critical in terms of understanding our understanding of the problem and therefore the solution.
[00:41:30.394 --> 00:41:31.795]  Our purpose is to save Australia.
[00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:35.117]  Just like your job is to save the United States.
[00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:36.317]  So it's very clear.
[00:41:36.357 --> 00:41:36.958]  To save Australia.
[00:41:36.978 --> 00:41:37.718]  How are we going to do that?
[00:41:38.382 --> 00:41:47.446]  We're going to create a moral political force that empowers Australians to reach their highest individual potential so that collectively all can participate in the reformation of Australia.
[00:41:47.686 --> 00:42:02.073]  Now, this is key because this creates a foundation of strong willed, strongly minded individuals who then build the nation from the ground up and that way they cannot impose anything upon us ever again.
[00:42:02.093 --> 00:42:04.774]  Now, the United States has been through their revolution.
[00:42:05.375 --> 00:42:05.815]  We haven't.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.262]  And so this is why it's brand new for us.
[00:42:08.622 --> 00:42:10.664]  But then we're working towards an end state.
[00:42:11.244 --> 00:42:15.748]  Now, this is all military planning, and I love the way the military does business.
[00:42:15.788 --> 00:42:16.829]  It is just unemotional.
[00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:19.551]  This is not a marketing statement.
[00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:22.493]  This is an end state, a checklist that we must achieve.
[00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:32.582]  So after empowering individuals to reach their highest individual potential, and then collectively assisting to reform the country from the ground up, this is what we want to create.
[00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:45.000]  Australia as a moral, sovereign, self-reliant, Christian Western democracy, which is economically powerful, militarily intimidating, politically free, culturally vibrant and socially cohesive.
[00:42:45.701 --> 00:42:46.621]  And that's what we're building.
[00:42:46.902 --> 00:42:53.347]  So every step that we take on this journey from where we are to where we want to be has to contribute directly to that end state.
[00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:54.768]  If it doesn't, it's out.
[00:42:55.608 --> 00:43:00.252]  And creating a wound in the Australian psyche of a civil war.
[00:43:01.297 --> 00:43:07.856]   is something that never really heals and it's one that prudent leadership demands we avoid at all
[00:43:07.856 --> 00:43:12.976]   costs. Now if we have to defend ourselves I have no problem with that. My natural instinct as a
[00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:20.496]   soldier is to squeeze the trigger. I get it. All right we lost his connection to the land down
[00:43:20.496 --> 00:43:27.617]   under where it's 755 central. We will reconnect with him and get him on to lay this out.
[00:43:27.758 --> 00:43:36.424]  And when he's saying Australia, you think America, you think United Kingdom, you think Germany, you think Mexico, you think Spain, you think South Africa, you think Nigeria.
[00:43:36.845 --> 00:43:38.286]  It's the same globalist force.
[00:43:38.846 --> 00:43:39.707]  Doing the same thing.
[00:43:39.747 --> 00:43:41.628]  They want a civil war here, black against white.
[00:43:41.989 --> 00:43:47.954]  They want a civil war in Australia to then discredit the idea of nationalism and then bring in global corporatism.
[00:43:48.394 --> 00:43:50.936]  And this is what he's saying is the solution to all this.
[00:43:51.356 --> 00:43:54.839]  So again, Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Abbasi joins us again.
[00:43:54.899 --> 00:43:56.020]  His Skype has come back.
[00:43:56.621 --> 00:44:00.244]  What you're saying is, again, the answer to everything.
[00:44:00.264 --> 00:44:03.086]  And I'm not just highlighting that because you're on the show and I like you.
[00:44:03.506 --> 00:44:04.407]  You are dead on here.
[00:44:04.427 --> 00:44:06.329]  And if we don't understand this, we're going to lose.
[00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:07.530]  If we understand it, we're going to win.
[00:44:09.895 --> 00:44:10.315]  That's correct.
[00:44:10.335 --> 00:44:11.476]  I'm not sure where I dropped out.
[00:44:11.496 --> 00:44:13.197]  Did I get to the insight we're trying to create?
[00:44:14.498 --> 00:44:17.000]  You know, we're going to go to break and you're going to do this 30 more minutes the next hour.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:17.741]  I really appreciate that.
[00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:21.183]  And we've got more great folks from Australia joining us, former political president and others.
[00:44:21.243 --> 00:44:23.765]  But yes, sir, you started to get to it.
[00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:39.296]   But I want everybody to stay with us into the next hour where I'm going to try to give you the floor to really walk through all this, because you've got a great military background and one of the top advisors to your government and how you guys are going to behave We'll then be an example to everybody else in the world.
[00:44:39.336 --> 00:44:44.740]  But the minute we have left in this hour, how do people find you, not just in Australia, but around the world?
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.501]  How do people support your fight?
[00:44:49.451 --> 00:44:50.091]  Spread the word.
[00:44:50.391 --> 00:44:51.372]  That's the best you can do.
[00:44:51.592 --> 00:44:54.254]  Just spread the word, spread the word, build the army, build the army.
[00:44:54.314 --> 00:44:59.817]  Anything to build the army is what will help us best because we need numbers and I mean big numbers.
[00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:07.362]  We need millions of people in Australia and we need tens of millions in the US and around the world to stand up and just say no.
[00:45:08.146 --> 00:45:09.287]  And there's nothing they can do.
[00:45:10.127 --> 00:45:11.768]  AustraliaOneParty.com.
[00:45:11.868 --> 00:45:13.529]  Australia's fight is everybody's fight.
[00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:20.412]  We face the exact same enemies, and we are all in a human alliance around the world against this globalist force.
[00:45:20.432 --> 00:45:24.734]  But the globalist force is coming after the Western republics and, quote, democracies.
[00:45:24.754 --> 00:45:28.055]  Because if they can destroy those, the world will be under the New World Order's control.
[00:45:28.396 --> 00:45:30.497]  We'll be back with hour number two straight ahead.
[00:45:30.317 --> 00:45:53.757]  Stay with us.
[00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:58.869]  And I had family that had worked in the government, in the military, like our guest, Ricardo Bossi.
[00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.891]  They were telling me about the plan to end the United States, bring in world government.
[00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:04.272]  He was reading a document from the 1980s planning it.
[00:46:04.653 --> 00:46:06.174]  So this is the same global program.
[00:46:06.974 --> 00:46:15.956]  Some stations don't carry the short five minutes, a lot do, but just specifically, Ricardo, you're a very polite guy, but I'll jump in a lot if you don't just take over.
[00:46:17.216 --> 00:46:27.518]  Tell folks exactly what you're facing, what's going on, and specifically how we don't fall into their trap, and how we have a peaceful revolution of non-compliance versus being roped into a violent revolution.
[00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:30.019]  Sure.
[00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:39.222]   What they're doing, as you've seen on the media, is confronting protesters.
[00:46:39.282 --> 00:46:42.144]  But what they're not showing you is the truth.
[00:46:42.364 --> 00:46:45.627]  And we have our own people out there which communicate what's going on.
[00:46:46.247 --> 00:46:51.171]  And you've seen the reports of violent right-wing anti-vaxxers.
[00:46:51.231 --> 00:46:52.932]  Well, there's nothing right-wing about us at all.
[00:46:53.012 --> 00:46:54.193]  I mean, check our policies out.
[00:46:55.174 --> 00:46:57.976]  And we're not violent and nor are the protesters.
[00:46:58.577 --> 00:47:11.777]   So what happens is, what happened in Melbourne most recently, One of our major unions, the CFMEU, the membership is split from the leadership because they know the leadership are fully on board with the globalists.
[00:47:11.817 --> 00:47:23.066]  There's an individual called Sharon Burrows, who used to be head of the Australian Council of Trade Union, that's the peak union body in Australia, who's now signed up globalists living in Belgium doing Karl Schwab's bidding.
[00:47:23.635 --> 00:47:28.118]  So anyway, they're splitting apart and they were forming up and they started marching.
[00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:40.146]  The police, there were about 300 or 400 there, the police told them to move on and the construction guys, they're pretty robust individuals down under, as I guess they are in the US, and they just ignored them.
[00:47:40.586 --> 00:47:44.469]  And then 300 to 400 turned into 5,000, turned into 10,000, turned into 20,000.
[00:47:44.629 --> 00:47:51.273]  But if you watch the news, it sounded like there were 300 cranky anti-vaxxers throwing fists at the police.
[00:47:51.293 --> 00:47:52.494]  It was completely the other way around.
[00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:54.659]  And so, they're lying to us.
[00:47:54.879 --> 00:47:58.483]  But now, how do we raise this army, for example?
[00:47:59.945 --> 00:48:00.445]  The truth.
[00:48:00.966 --> 00:48:02.207]  The truth is what's going to do it.
[00:48:02.227 --> 00:48:04.510]  Let me give you one story that'll just get you riled.
[00:48:05.371 --> 00:48:13.961]  We have in Australia a 90-year suppression order which conceals the names of 28 VIP pedophiles, including a former Prime Minister.
[00:48:14.679 --> 00:48:16.461]  Now this document is a police document.
[00:48:16.481 --> 00:48:24.508]  It was raised by Senator Bill Heffernan in 2015 in a Senate inquiry and he sat alone because no other senator would be there with him.
[00:48:25.529 --> 00:48:38.400]  So we've got a 90-year suppression order which nobody, no party, Liberal, Labour, Nationals and Greens, none of them have whispered because we know that that's one of their key tools for getting the results that they want.
[00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:41.763]  Whether it's the judiciary or the military or whatever.
[00:48:42.324 --> 00:48:43.665]  That's the part of the blackmail.
[00:48:44.065 --> 00:48:44.986]  Now, that's not the only one.
[00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:54.212]  There's another one that came out of South Australia, which is one of our Australian states, and there was a Mulligan inquiry, it was called, Justice Mulligan, and that has an 80-year suppression order.
[00:48:54.552 --> 00:49:15.685]   So pedophilia, this golden thread, I shouldn't call it a golden thread, I should call it something less Glossy, this awful thread that runs through the control and that's how one of the main reasons, one of the main methods they have used to get a hold of the judiciary, the bureaucracy, the military, the academia, the media, everything.
[00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:30.468]  It's that and so get the truth out and we raise the truth as much as we can so people wake up and they realize there is a war and it is against us and the police are doing the bidding.
[00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:34.745]   Now you mentioned Why don't the police and the military do something?
[00:49:35.645 --> 00:49:41.007]  Alex, I've been looking for white hats in the ADF, in the Australian Defence Force, for a long time now, and I can't see any.
[00:49:41.147 --> 00:49:41.668]  And I mean it.
[00:49:42.068 --> 00:49:42.828]  I've looked hard.
[00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:46.870]  In fact, they've even turned some of my former colleagues against me.
[00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:49.131]  I was a best man at one of my friends' weddings.
[00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:54.233]  He was another Special Forces officer, and they sent him up against me to get some intel to find out what I was up to.
[00:49:54.793 --> 00:49:57.914]  And so this is really Australia contra mondum.
[00:49:57.954 --> 00:49:58.955]  Australia against the world.
[00:49:59.682 --> 00:50:00.562]  They are.
[00:50:00.602 --> 00:50:01.483]  There are no white hats.
[00:50:01.783 --> 00:50:11.566]  And I have this little dream that when we get into power, and we will, that I'll call up, look for a decent four-star U.S.
[00:50:11.806 --> 00:50:15.628]  Marine Corps General, because they can see sea, air, land and special ops fights.
[00:50:16.268 --> 00:50:27.365]   We'll bring them in on a five-year contract to Australia, and he'll have one job, is to turn this Woke joke, which is what the Australian Defence Force is, into a fighting machine again.
[00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:28.405]  And so we'll get him in.
[00:50:28.505 --> 00:50:31.947]  The other thing we'll have to do is we'll sack everybody from the rank of Brigadier up.
[00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.847]  We'll be retired immediately.
[00:50:33.947 --> 00:50:34.307]  Stay there.
[00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:35.308]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:50:35.208 --> 00:50:42.208]  Ricardo Bossi, stay with us.
[00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:48.177]   I want everybody listening here in the United States on hundreds of radio stations and over 100 TV stations to
[00:50:48.177 --> 00:50:49.208]  please...
[00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:59.160]  Take notes and check out everything we're laying out and breaking down here on the Alex Jones Show on this live September 26 Sunday broadcast.
[00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:05.565]  Because all I read is what the UN and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group are putting out and the Club of Rome.
[00:51:05.885 --> 00:51:07.267]  It's all the same people that chair it all.
[00:51:07.307 --> 00:51:12.170]  The CFR and the Royal Commissions, the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[00:51:12.571 --> 00:51:13.752]  These are roundtable groups.
[00:51:14.372 --> 00:51:21.377]  And it's how the corporate British Empire controlled the world, but it's not the British Empire today, but it used that skeletal system.
[00:51:22.469 --> 00:51:27.770]  And if we're going to defeat it, it's what Mahatma Gandhi did in India against that very empire.
[00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.791]  And what our guest said earlier is totally true.
[00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:37.812]  Australia is having its coming-of-age real revolution right now against the governor-general and the vestigial systems of tyranny.
[00:51:38.452 --> 00:51:45.394]  And they looked at the whole world and said, that's the best place to have our beta test to trigger our civil war, crush the people, and bring in total tyranny.
[00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:50.809]  Same thing that's happening here with no borders, no walls, the attacks on America, the racial division.
[00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.010]  All of this is to demoralize you.
[00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.771]  Putting in Biden, he's supposed to be hated.
[00:51:55.051 --> 00:51:56.571]  He's supposed to make the country look terrible.
[00:51:56.831 --> 00:52:01.193]  Because they want a collapse but with them posing as the saviors.
[00:52:01.513 --> 00:52:02.993]  They're bringing in their world government.
[00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:04.714]  They're bringing in their world ID.
[00:52:05.214 --> 00:52:14.037]  So you see Australia with the military and the police and unmarked police beating up old ladies, arresting men, women and children for going outside saying they're not essential.
[00:52:15.353 --> 00:52:37.033]  This is part of the takeover of the planet, and there's only one way politically, culturally, militarily to defeat this, and it's how he's talking about recognizing it's a foreign takeover, recognizing it's illegitimate, recognizing we have global solidarity with each other against this corporate New World Order that uses socialism and communism and leftist garbage as its control system.
[00:52:37.373 --> 00:52:38.154]  We're not right-wing.
[00:52:38.194 --> 00:52:38.775]  I agree with him.
[00:52:39.034 --> 00:52:44.673]   We're populist worldwide who want to get back to governing our own countries for the people,
[00:52:44.673 --> 00:52:46.315]  by the people, of the people.
[00:52:46.315 --> 00:52:49.934]  So Ricardo Bossi's here with us, AustraliaOneParty.com.
[00:52:49.934 --> 00:52:56.454]   And again, he was a Special Health Services Lieutenant Colonel, and he was also National Commander
[00:52:56.454 --> 00:52:58.233]  of Australian SAS Forces.
[00:52:58.233 --> 00:53:02.873]   He also was the Director of Future Capability Development and Headquarters Special Operations, amongst others.
[00:53:02.873 --> 00:53:07.753]   He can speak to the type of societal behavioral psychology takeover
[00:53:07.753 --> 00:53:11.554]  that wants to make it physical to radically reshuffle.
[00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:16.174]  That's why they're building, quote, emergency camps for shielding in place.
[00:53:16.374 --> 00:53:17.955]  They have the same thing in Europe, same thing here.
[00:53:18.276 --> 00:53:24.500]  They say soon we'll put people that are healthy in camps to protect them from those that aren't and the anti-vaxxers.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.824]  That's the cover for the internment camps they're building once they trigger the civil wars.
[00:53:30.224 --> 00:53:34.588]  So they have them here, they have them in Canada, Europe, UK, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:53:34.888 --> 00:53:37.410]  This is a formulaic operation globally.
[00:53:37.991 --> 00:53:40.453]  We must formulaically awaken to it and say no.
[00:53:40.753 --> 00:53:50.661]  I'm going to stop ranting here, Ricardo Bossi, but you've got the floor of the rest of this segment and the next to raise the alarm worldwide and explain again how we have victory without violence.
[00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:52.466]  Absolutely.
[00:53:52.907 --> 00:53:55.529]  Well, you mentioned the Constitution, the Governor-General.
[00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:01.013]  In Australia, and this is part of raising the awareness, letting people know there are solutions to this.
[00:54:01.193 --> 00:54:01.974]  Let me give you an example.
[00:54:02.054 --> 00:54:07.438]  I wrote an open letter to our Governor-General, whom I knew when he was a lieutenant colonel and I was a major.
[00:54:08.459 --> 00:54:11.321]  And he has options open to him that the people aren't aware of.
[00:54:11.361 --> 00:54:15.945]  For example, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet isn't mentioned in our Constitution.
[00:54:16.005 --> 00:54:19.928]  A national executive, federal executive is mentioned, appointed by the Governor-General.
[00:54:20.588 --> 00:54:31.818]   Now, if a government continues with unconstitutional behavior of which there is sufficient evidence, without a doubt, grossly unconstitutional behavior on any level.
[00:54:33.218 --> 00:54:35.799]  The Governor-General must warn the government of that fact.
[00:54:36.299 --> 00:54:40.721]  If they persist with their unconstitutional behavior, the Governor-General has the right to dismiss the government.
[00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:45.422]  Now, nobody wants to do that because it's unstable.
[00:54:45.802 --> 00:54:50.920]   It destabilizes the The rule of law in the minds of the people.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:55:00.042]  But he has the power and I mean you can't think of a better reason to start maybe making some suggestions to the government about the constitutionality of their behaviour.
[00:55:00.382 --> 00:55:02.323]  But the Governor-General has the lawful authority.
[00:55:02.363 --> 00:55:03.003]  Now imagine this.
[00:55:03.043 --> 00:55:06.164]  This is just one option open to ending this immediately.
[00:55:07.104 --> 00:55:12.805]  The Governor-General has the power to warn the government to cease their unconstitutional behaviour.
[00:55:12.825 --> 00:55:13.645]  Let's say it doesn't.
[00:55:14.445 --> 00:55:29.713]   Then he dismisses the government And he may appoint, for a period of three months, anybody to act as members of the Federal Executive Council.
[00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:39.841]  And they may then operate as departmental secretaries, or in the US model, secretaries of state, secretaries of health, secretaries of defense, the cabinet.
[00:55:40.642 --> 00:55:42.183]  And so this could be ended tomorrow.
[00:55:43.526 --> 00:55:48.131]  He appoints some people, they fill in and they take over running the country.
[00:55:48.171 --> 00:55:54.617]  It's quite lawful because this was one of the checks and measures that was put in by our founding fathers to make sure tyranny was not allowed.
[00:55:54.657 --> 00:55:57.299]  Now, what advice is the Governor-General getting?
[00:55:57.339 --> 00:55:59.101]  Well, I can guarantee it's globalist advice.
[00:55:59.662 --> 00:56:00.703]  It's not the real advice.
[00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:01.824]  Now, it's up to him.
[00:56:04.086 --> 00:56:05.387]  He's been given the opportunity.
[00:56:05.427 --> 00:56:07.689]  There are opportunities now for him to take action.
[00:56:07.729 --> 00:56:11.029]   If he doesn't, Like everybody else here signed his own death warrant.
[00:56:11.049 --> 00:56:15.771]  Because one of our other key policies is we're going to reintroduce death penalty for treason and sedition.
[00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:18.272]  And we got rid of the death penalty 70 years ago.
[00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:21.494]  And we're going to bring it back.
[00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:30.538]  And what's interesting is that the leftists are claiming that we're brutal and inhuman for reintroducing the death penalty for treason and sedition.
[00:56:31.298 --> 00:56:37.337]   Yet these are the same people Who allow the most egregious abortion, full-term abortion laws in Australia.
[00:56:37.357 --> 00:56:37.958]  In fact, the U.S.
[00:56:37.978 --> 00:56:39.398]  has only just caught up to Australia.
[00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:44.421]  See, the globalist hands reach into every aspect of our life here.
[00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:49.884]  We've had full-term abortion, partial birth abortion laws creeping their way across Australia for years now.
[00:56:51.145 --> 00:56:52.685]  And the Australian people don't know about it.
[00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:53.566]  They don't understand it.
[00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:54.326]  They don't believe it.
[00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:59.249]  But I need to get this out in full so people of Australia understand this.
[00:56:59.889 --> 00:57:01.250]  It is lawful in Australia.
[00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:11.351]  At the point of birth, for a doctor to partially deliver the baby so the baby's head remains inside the mother, so it's not born, inverted commas, by definition.
[00:57:12.271 --> 00:57:22.974]  The doctor then gets a pair of medicine bound scissors and jabs a hole in the back of the baby's head, cuts it open, inserts a vacuum pump and sucks out the living brain of a baby at full term.
[00:57:23.654 --> 00:57:27.175]  The baby is then delivered, but it's not called a baby, it's called medical waste.
[00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:30.065]  It's not given a birth certificate, a death certificate.
[00:57:30.685 --> 00:57:33.326]  It is then sold as body parts to corporations.
[00:57:34.726 --> 00:57:38.568]  Now, this is legal in Australia and allegedly called health for women.
[00:57:39.568 --> 00:57:51.307]   Now, if these people are such moral imbeciles that they can't see the difference between a morning after pill And a full-term abortion, and they have no place in polite society.
[00:57:51.427 --> 00:57:54.409]  They know exactly what they're doing, and some stations just joined us earlier.
[00:57:54.869 --> 00:57:58.510]  You broke down how it's the same thing in Europe, same thing in the U.S., same thing there.
[00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:10.435]  They use pedophilia in government by promoting pedophiles from the level of mayor up to your Senate and other areas, and that your government had 80-year seals on that in the government.
[00:58:10.855 --> 00:58:17.957]   And if you look at the German government, 30 plus thousand children placed with pedophiles to then be leased out to politicians.
[00:58:18.397 --> 00:58:25.958]  We even learned the CIA would put pedophiles in charge over police departments in areas in Afghanistan and supply them with children.
[00:58:26.518 --> 00:58:31.539]  So this is an evil cult of pedophiles that are at the heart of what we face worldwide.
[00:58:33.279 --> 00:58:34.100]  Yeah, exactly right.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.800]  It is worldwide.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.500]  It is common.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.660]  It is the way it's been done.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.160]  And people have to understand this.
[00:58:39.501 --> 00:58:40.861]  This has been going on since forever.
[00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:42.221]  This is not a recent innovation.
[00:58:43.675 --> 00:58:46.159]  This is millennia old, these practices.
[00:58:46.299 --> 00:58:50.867]  Child sacrifice, the whole adrenochrome issue.
[00:58:50.887 --> 00:58:52.349]  This is not new.
[00:58:52.369 --> 00:58:54.192]  This is an ancient war.
[00:58:54.513 --> 00:58:57.678]  And look, we're not fighting just flesh and blood, as you well know.
[00:58:59.218 --> 00:59:03.701]  We are fighting satanic forces, by definition, satanic forces.
[00:59:04.201 --> 00:59:09.725]  And one of the major means by which it is delivered is by the Masonic lodges.
[00:59:10.386 --> 00:59:15.929]  Now, the low-level Masons think it's just a gentleman's club and you get to promote your business and do well.
[00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.332]  But at the higher levels, we know exactly what's going on.
[00:59:20.572 --> 00:59:21.273]  It is satanic.
[00:59:21.895 --> 00:59:25.820]  It is a blood ritual sacrifice that goes on regularly.
[00:59:26.221 --> 00:59:31.507]  And I've been contacted by Masons who have reluctantly admitted, we think you're right.
[00:59:31.687 --> 00:59:32.768]  There's something going on.
[00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:34.711]  Something's not quite right.
[00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:37.695]  But the Masons have penetrated every aspect of Australian society.
[00:59:38.556 --> 00:59:55.862]   Now, Given that case, and I think I mentioned it earlier, when a body is so riddled with cancer that if you try to cut it out you're going to kill the host, that's why the solution to this must be measured, it must be careful, because otherwise we're going to kill, we will face a civilizational collapse.
[00:59:56.262 --> 01:00:02.524]  Now imagine if all the crooks put their hands up and said, thank you, you're all right, and we'll go away, the place will cease to function.
[01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:13.897]   So we have to transition from this Masonic controlled Satanist cult Absolutely, and we've got to explain this when we come back.
[01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.197]  It's a mystery school.
[01:00:15.337 --> 01:00:17.578]  It's what intelligence agencies grew out of.
[01:00:17.638 --> 01:00:25.200]  It's just a cult that is in control worldwide, whose ritual is abusing children, killing children, and it's real, and it's coming out.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:31.002]  One city in Germany, 30,000 children taken from Christians, given to pedophiles for the government.
[01:00:31.222 --> 01:00:31.742]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:36.426 --> 01:00:40.307]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:40.427 --> 01:00:48.389]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:57.230]  I guess it's Monday morning there in Australia, and it's still Sunday here.
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:03.291]   Coming up, Monica Schmidt, been a political prisoner arrested for trying to organize businesses
[01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:04.971]  that said they would stay open.
[01:01:04.971 --> 01:01:07.929]   Only big corporations are allowed to stay open and consolidate control.
[01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:10.411]  This is economic warfare on so many levels.
[01:01:10.411 --> 01:01:12.291]  Ricardo Bossi is our guest.
[01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:16.570]   He heads up Australia One Party, AustraliaOneParty.com or Australia One.
[01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:19.331]  And we've got about eight, nine minutes left here.
[01:01:19.331 --> 01:01:20.811]  What can Americans do?
[01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.771]   Because again, you're being attacked by the same globalist force.
[01:01:23.771 --> 01:01:25.771]  Um...
[01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:29.981]  What can people do in other parts of the world to try to free Australia and free other areas?
[01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:31.404]  Canada's in deep trouble.
[01:01:31.464 --> 01:01:33.968]  I mean, clearly, just expose the New World Order.
[01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:35.770]  But what else can we do?
[01:01:36.972 --> 01:01:40.273]  We know that they want to push everybody into violent revolution.
[01:01:40.293 --> 01:01:41.394]  That's why they tighten it down.
[01:01:41.434 --> 01:01:42.514]  It's why it gets worse and worse.
[01:01:42.915 --> 01:01:44.555]  We know they've built the emergency centers.
[01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:49.997]  If they were able to trigger a civil war, they say they want a post-industrial world.
[01:01:50.037 --> 01:01:53.439]  They say they want general society to collapse and depopulate.
[01:01:53.799 --> 01:02:00.302]  Well, I guess the globalists sit back in their mountaintop redoubts and roast marshmallows over the flames that consume us.
[01:02:01.643 --> 01:02:05.769]  So you've got a big military background at national, global strategy levels.
[01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:10.797]  What would it look like if they were successfully able to trigger a civil war in Australia?
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.282]  Civilizational collapse.
[01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:18.053]  Because we're a very dispersed population.
[01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:21.976]  We're centred in our major cities, so it's easy to contain us.
[01:02:22.036 --> 01:02:27.539]  And they've been working hard to strip the rural areas of its population.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.621]  And of course, our policy is to reverse that.
[01:02:30.201 --> 01:02:34.144]  But they lock us up in the city and they'll just kill us.
[01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:35.685]  They will just kill us.
[01:02:35.705 --> 01:02:36.666]  They will just lock us down.
[01:02:38.067 --> 01:02:41.249]  Fast track it from the actual, let's say there's a violent response.
[01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:44.371]  Those that take the violent actions are jailed.
[01:02:44.758 --> 01:02:48.841]  They will then impose even more draconian lockdowns on the entire country.
[01:02:49.602 --> 01:02:56.808]  And the Holodomor, which was the starvation of the Ukrainians under the Soviet Union, millions died to the point of cannibalism.
[01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:05.517]  The Chinese communists twice killed, I think, up to 40 million of their own people through famine.
[01:03:05.857 --> 01:03:07.238]  So these things are not unusual.
[01:03:07.298 --> 01:03:08.539]  This is not odd.
[01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:10.200]  This is not unexpected.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.561]  This is exactly what they do.
[01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:13.763]  And that's why people have to understand their history.
[01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.104]  This is not bizarre.
[01:03:15.684 --> 01:03:18.065]  It is not beyond the realms of reality.
[01:03:18.285 --> 01:03:18.725]  Exactly.
[01:03:18.765 --> 01:03:25.608]  This is a communist, great leap forward, cultural revolution playbook that we saw in the Russian Revolution, we've seen everywhere.
[01:03:25.948 --> 01:03:29.770]  And again, financed by the very same banks in Russia, now financing this now.
[01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:30.790]  I mean, you're dead on.
[01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:35.252]  They are actually trying a collapse level event to get full control and depopulate.
[01:03:36.556 --> 01:03:38.117]  And that is exactly correct.
[01:03:38.677 --> 01:03:41.059]  And there is no real war.
[01:03:41.179 --> 01:03:42.100]  Let me just jump quickly.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.941]  Beware of the China threat.
[01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:45.222]  Is there going to be a war against China?
[01:03:45.242 --> 01:03:45.662]  Probably.
[01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:47.003]  Is it going to be a real war?
[01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:47.643]  Absolutely.
[01:03:48.064 --> 01:03:49.064]  Is it going to be necessary?
[01:03:49.124 --> 01:03:50.045]  No, it's a distraction.
[01:03:50.065 --> 01:03:52.066]  There's absolutely no requirement.
[01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:54.048]  It was just like World War One, World War Two.
[01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:55.429]  It's good business.
[01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:56.950]  It's great business.
[01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.571]  The whole thing was set up that way.
[01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:00.832]  And we're going to go through it all again.
[01:04:00.852 --> 01:04:05.015]  So again, if people knew their real history, they would recognize this for what it is.
[01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.336]  It is a lie.
[01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:10.874]  Everything they've been taught is a lie, and I understand the difficulty of accepting that.
[01:04:11.494 --> 01:04:12.155]  It is hard.
[01:04:13.095 --> 01:04:15.997]  But the fact is, we've got to, you said, you know, what can the world do?
[01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:24.804]  Reveal the truth, reveal the truth, and communicate with each other internationally, and share each other, share with each other the stories.
[01:04:25.964 --> 01:04:27.806]  It's paramount importance.
[01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:28.826]  It really is.
[01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:41.369]   There's one other thing the US can do particularly, because you've got the capability, and that is we're going to have some elections coming up shortly, and I'll bet my left Marble, that it will be corrupted.
[01:04:41.389 --> 01:04:41.870]  We know that.
[01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:48.452]  It'll either be a fake postal election or it'll just be fraudulent.
[01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:48.893]  We know that.
[01:04:48.933 --> 01:04:53.075]  We haven't had an honest election in Australia for decades and we've got the data on that as well.
[01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:54.155]  Books have been written about it.
[01:04:54.655 --> 01:04:56.696]  There's nothing unusual about that statement.
[01:04:57.496 --> 01:04:58.297]  So there will be a war.
[01:04:58.337 --> 01:04:59.237]  There will be an election.
[01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:02.299]  Monitoring.
[01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:07.621]  Now we have, knowing that it's going to be a crooked election, we have our own strategies and plans of what we're going to do.
[01:05:08.832 --> 01:05:10.253]  We expect it to be crooked.
[01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:18.539]  We expect to have, like you have in the US, an audit, and we expect the audit to reveal exactly what your audits have revealed in Arizona and elsewhere.
[01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:25.384]  And so this is part of that slow process of legitimately demonstrating the lies of the globalists.
[01:05:25.944 --> 01:05:32.108]  So the US, because you've got the capability, track and monitor our elections when they're coming up.
[01:05:32.148 --> 01:05:35.571]  Now, the next federal election is due in May next year, May 2022.
[01:05:37.899 --> 01:05:40.760]  It may be held sooner than that, but that's it.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.602]  If we can get as honest an election as possible, we've got a chance.
[01:05:46.722 --> 01:05:52.484]  Even if it's crooked, then we'll go through the same patient process as you have done, and we'll audit, audit, audit.
[01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.224]  And so keep an eye on each other.
[01:05:54.244 --> 01:05:55.604]  We're like a family.
[01:05:56.085 --> 01:06:00.346]  The Australians are looking at the Americans, the Americans are looking at the Australians, we're all looking at the Canadians, the Europe.
[01:06:01.098 --> 01:06:07.780]  This is, as you said at the very beginning, this is one human race and we are fighting for our collective survival.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.701]  We have the same adversary applying exactly the same tactics.
[01:06:11.781 --> 01:06:13.162]  Australia is lucky.
[01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:14.562]  We're the first ones through the door.
[01:06:15.443 --> 01:06:18.984]  And as you know, the first one through the door always gets a blood nose.
[01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:23.125]  But as long as we've got a lot of people behind us, we'll eventually we'll take the room.
[01:06:24.139 --> 01:06:25.220]  And so that's what we need to do.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:35.430]  We need to come together as a global community and understand that whatever apparent differences we have, that the great majority of people are good people.
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.331]  They're decent people.
[01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:40.175]  We are not a cancer on the planet as the lunatic Greens would have us believe.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.421]  Well, that's right.
[01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:48.626]  We need to educate everybody that the Greens are a depopulationist, elite movement.
[01:06:48.846 --> 01:06:54.170]  All of it is right out of Davos, right out of the Globalist, and is the enemy of humanity.
[01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:55.852]  And they've got to be stopped.
[01:06:55.872 --> 01:06:56.713]  They will be stopped.
[01:06:59.095 --> 01:06:59.435]  That's it.
[01:06:59.575 --> 01:07:05.360]  And we've only got a couple of minutes left, but I'd like to just finish on this because I'm a good student of the U.S.
[01:07:09.035 --> 01:07:10.237]  A couple of points.
[01:07:10.757 --> 01:07:18.647]  Washington at one point had no more than 20% support, so four out of five of the colonists were telling the Brits exactly where he was, and he still won.
[01:07:19.027 --> 01:07:22.772]  The reason I tell that story is because we don't need everybody, we just need enough.
[01:07:23.412 --> 01:07:25.315]  We just need enough and we can win this war.
[01:07:26.016 --> 01:07:27.397]  In Australia, that translates to 20%.
[01:07:27.457 --> 01:07:28.978]  That's 5 million people.
[01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.159]  We get 5 million.
[01:07:30.439 --> 01:07:30.919]  We win.
[01:07:31.179 --> 01:07:34.501]  Davos loses and they'll never come back because we know exactly what we're going to do.
[01:07:34.561 --> 01:07:35.582]  Day one, we get control.
[01:07:35.982 --> 01:07:37.363]  We know exactly what our plan is.
[01:07:37.403 --> 01:07:38.323]  We've got it ready to go.
[01:07:39.144 --> 01:07:42.086]  The next point is, and I'll finish on this and I'll let you wrap it up.
[01:07:43.186 --> 01:07:48.049]  The opening lines to your Declaration of Independence, the most beautiful political lines ever written.
[01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:50.451]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:52.612]  And you know the rest.
[01:07:53.263 --> 01:07:56.304]  But those opening lines, as beautiful as they were, were irrelevant.
[01:07:57.304 --> 01:08:00.344]  They only had meaning and effect because of the last line.
[01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:08.646]  And this is what Australians have to understand for the first time in their lives, because we are fighting for our country for the first time in our lives on our own land.
[01:08:09.146 --> 01:08:11.587]  And here's the last line which everybody should remember.
[01:08:13.327 --> 01:08:20.675]   We collectively commit our lives Our fortunes and our sacred honour.
[01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:22.416]  And that's what we have to commit.
[01:08:22.736 --> 01:08:27.619]  That is the price of freedom that we must pay, that our fathers and forefathers before us paid.
[01:08:28.059 --> 01:08:29.460]  We have to be ready to do the same.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.921]  We have to commit everything to this fight.
[01:08:32.161 --> 01:08:32.561]  Everything.
[01:08:32.621 --> 01:08:33.762]  Leave nothing on the table.
[01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:37.744]  Our lives, our wealth and our sacred honour.
[01:08:39.013 --> 01:08:42.575]  And we are blessed and honored, as you said, to be in this position.
[01:08:42.615 --> 01:08:43.655]  This is a great turning.
[01:08:44.116 --> 01:08:46.157]  This only happens every three or four or five generations.
[01:08:46.177 --> 01:08:47.877]  This is a very special time to be out live.
[01:08:48.198 --> 01:08:50.719]  We are all brothers and sisters together around the world in this fight.
[01:08:51.179 --> 01:08:55.301]  And I want to thank you, Ricardo Bossi from AustraliaOneParty.com for joining us.
[01:08:55.361 --> 01:09:00.043]  Please give us updates as this develops and you're welcome to file reports and send them to us.
[01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.064]  We'll air them here as well.
[01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.025]  And so God bless you and thank you so much.
[01:09:04.626 --> 01:09:05.126]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:06.578 --> 01:09:07.318]  Extremely powerful.
[01:09:07.338 --> 01:09:13.100]  And we're going to talk to more folks in Australia straight ahead because the tyranny of Australia today is the tyranny here tomorrow.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.281]  But we're going to win.
[01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:15.521]  This is a great opportunity.
[01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:16.822]  Great job to the crew.
[01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:17.962]  I'll be right back.
[01:09:18.042 --> 01:09:20.343]  And then, Owen Schroyer is live in studio.
[01:09:20.903 --> 01:09:22.764]  Here is just a short clip.
[01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:27.387]  I've just been pulled over by the cops, probably because I'm outside of my 5Ks, but we'll see what happens.
[01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:32.407]   stand up, you should stand up as rifle butts are cracking your face for a virus cooked
[01:09:32.407 --> 01:09:36.606]   up by Fauci and released by these very people for the power grab they're now engaged in.
[01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.167]  It's in the Rockefeller document, Operation Lockstep.
[01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:42.646]   So here is Monica Schmidt and then we'll go to this modern day hero.
[01:09:42.646 --> 01:09:48.766]   I've just been pulled over by the cops, probably because I'm outside of my 5Ks, but we'll see
[01:09:48.766 --> 01:09:49.766]  what happens.
[01:09:49.766 --> 01:10:00.246]  I thought I'd put the live stream on just in case.
[01:10:00.181 --> 01:10:02.181]  That was stupid.
[01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:06.181]   *sigh* *sigh*
[01:10:06.181 --> 01:10:10.181]   *sigh* *sigh*
[01:10:10.181 --> 01:10:14.181]   *sigh* *sigh*
[01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:16.805]   *sigh* Good, you?
[01:10:17.145 --> 01:10:19.707]  We're just from the Springvale Police Station.
[01:10:20.328 --> 01:10:25.792]  At the moment, we need to have a chat to you about a matter of incitement, so I need to place you under arrest for that, okay?
[01:10:25.812 --> 01:10:26.093]  Pardon?
[01:10:26.733 --> 01:10:28.655]  At the moment, you're under arrest for incitement.
[01:10:28.675 --> 01:10:30.276]  Have you guys been following me?
[01:10:30.296 --> 01:10:32.678]  You do not have to say how you're doing, but I need you to say that you may report an offence.
[01:10:32.698 --> 01:10:33.518]  Do you understand that?
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.581]  Do you understand that, Monica?
[01:10:36.601 --> 01:10:37.061]  No comment.
[01:10:37.602 --> 01:10:37.842]  Okay.
[01:10:38.102 --> 01:10:39.883]  Please share this video as much as possible.
[01:10:39.964 --> 01:10:41.605]  Monica Smith has just been arrested for incitement.
[01:10:41.425 --> 01:10:42.425]  for incitement.
[01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:43.425]  Can you take that off for me, please?
[01:10:43.425 --> 01:10:44.425]  I'm gonna find, we're saving that.
[01:10:44.425 --> 01:10:45.425]  Can you take that off?
[01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:52.065]   So here is another clip of her, what she was arrested for.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.464]  Here is the thought crime in the once free country, now known as, not Australia, but New North Korea.
[01:10:57.324 --> 01:11:04.324]  here it is.
[01:11:04.324 --> 01:11:21.523]  And so she tried to speak.
[01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:22.324]  They tried to arrest her.
[01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:22.985]  People stood up.
[01:11:23.705 --> 01:11:25.145]  The thugs trying to assault a woman.
[01:11:25.185 --> 01:11:30.206]  They call that incitement because she made them beat up that man and take him to jail.
[01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:31.187]  Incredible.
[01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:36.248]  Joining us again in the middle of the early morning is the lady, Monica Schmidt.
[01:11:36.308 --> 01:11:38.428]  Here's the headline out of the biggest newspaper in Australia.
[01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:42.269]  Anti-vax leader reveals engagement after release from jail.
[01:11:42.809 --> 01:11:56.859]   News.com.au, Australia's leading news site, reports she's been released after the Supreme Court said That she's being basically held for too long without bail, but she still faces time in prison.
[01:11:57.539 --> 01:12:00.100]  So we really appreciate Monica Schmidt.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.561]  We really appreciate her joining us.
[01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:01.841]  Wow.
[01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:02.762]  Just amazing times.
[01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:04.282]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:12:05.683 --> 01:12:06.744]  Oh, it's an absolute honor.
[01:12:06.784 --> 01:12:08.325]  I'm so excited to be on here.
[01:12:08.385 --> 01:12:09.585]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:12:10.866 --> 01:12:13.227]  Well, they tried to silence you and it's not worked.
[01:12:13.267 --> 01:12:14.248]  You've got the floor right now.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.229]  To just tell us what's happened in prison, where your country is, where this is going, and just everything that's happened.
[01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:21.890]  Sure.
[01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:24.151]  Well, I will just set the record straight, Alex.
[01:12:24.571 --> 01:12:28.992]  I was in prison for 22 days, not six months, although it did feel like six months.
[01:12:29.272 --> 01:12:32.052]  But I had a great legal team, so it wasn't too, too long.
[01:12:32.453 --> 01:12:41.335]  But basically, the bail conditions, Alex, well, I have a website with almost 70,000 subscribers, which in Australia is really quite significant.
[01:12:41.715 --> 01:12:44.936]  And I'm also the vice president of a newly formed political party.
[01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:51.077]  Now, they actually wanted me to delete my entire website in the bail conditions.
[01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:56.844]  So I was absolutely, it wasn't even a question whether or not I could sign those bail conditions.
[01:12:57.425 --> 01:12:58.928]  The wording was really interesting.
[01:12:58.788 --> 01:13:06.908]   It said, "You must delete everything that incites opposition to the Chief Health Officer's
[01:13:06.908 --> 01:13:09.828]  directions," which is anything that is to do with COVID.
[01:13:09.828 --> 01:13:16.028]   So basically what they were saying is, not that I was inciting people to break show directions,
[01:13:16.028 --> 01:13:21.548]   but that I was inciting opposition, which is literally just me speaking out that I don't
[01:13:22.484 --> 01:13:30.229]   Now, I don't know about what you think about political parties, but it's pretty much a political party's job to oppose the current government.
[01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:44.098]  So if I had signed that bail conditions, my whole year of work, the 70,000 subscribers, the seven staff that I had, would have all been absolutely just deleted off the face of the website.
[01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:45.646]  So I didn't sign it.
[01:13:45.686 --> 01:13:51.749]  On top of that, there was curfews in place for myself, personally, above any show directions.
[01:13:52.109 --> 01:14:00.134]  So I would have to be in my home at 7pm till 6am every single day until my actual hearing, which could be two years away.
[01:14:00.674 --> 01:14:03.636]  So I was absolutely not willing to sign that.
[01:14:03.676 --> 01:14:04.937]  So it was a really easy decision.
[01:14:05.492 --> 01:14:12.756]  But then, you know, when I was on my way to prison in a prison transport truck, I realized what I had signed myself up for.
[01:14:13.156 --> 01:14:17.899]  But look, it worked out really well and I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I don't regret anything and I wouldn't take it back.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.741]  It's been really great for the movement here in Australia.
[01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:22.001]  It's woken a lot of people up.
[01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:32.304]  It's given a lot of people courage because, you know, not everyone can do the same thing because we all have different states in life and different abilities, but everyone can do probably more than what they're doing.
[01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:34.765]  And that was my calling at that moment.
[01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:41.327]  I don't have children, so I was able to go to prison for 22 days and no one was seriously traumatized by that.
[01:14:41.847 --> 01:14:47.711]  That was something that I could do for Australia to bring awareness internationally and locally to what's going on.
[01:14:48.011 --> 01:15:15.707]   The fact that someone like me, who has never been in trouble with the police, who's respected, I'm very well networked in the political scene in Australia and so forth, and so for someone like me to go to prison, I think it was a shock for Australia and internationally, and I'm glad to have been given the opportunity to stand up for my rights because, you know, I would rather be in prison Why do you think they picked Australia?
[01:15:15.747 --> 01:15:20.394]  Because this is all scripted.
[01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.056]  It's all a global Great Reset rollout.
[01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:25.521]  They admit it is in the Davos Group announcements.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:32.281]  We played a clip before he came on of John Kerry, the climate czar, saying, oh, this is a global corporate takeover.
[01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:33.542]  This is about carbon.
[01:15:33.842 --> 01:15:34.862]  This is about cutting carbon.
[01:15:34.882 --> 01:15:36.062]  We're going to have carbon lockdowns.
[01:15:36.582 --> 01:15:40.683]  And so it's all official that this was just using the virus to train you to live under a police state.
[01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:45.164]  The corporations of the world are establishing a Chinese style dictatorship.
[01:15:45.224 --> 01:15:46.625]  Why do you think they chose Australia?
[01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:49.385]  And then after you comment, Simon can pop in on this.
[01:15:49.405 --> 01:15:50.466]  You guys are free for all.
[01:15:51.286 --> 01:15:55.807]  And why do you think they picked the South to be the most draconian of the most oppressive area?
[01:15:57.443 --> 01:16:03.506]  Well, it's obvious that Australia was picked because Australians are generally very laid-back people.
[01:16:04.266 --> 01:16:07.628]  Australians are very friendly and they're very trusting to their government.
[01:16:08.408 --> 01:16:12.370]  Now, the Australian people could never have prepared for this.
[01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:15.231]  They don't have guns, firstly, like they do in America.
[01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:16.391]  They're unarmed.
[01:16:17.312 --> 01:16:18.693]  And they trust their government.
[01:16:19.293 --> 01:16:22.194]  We've got this, she'll be right, mate, attitude in Australia.
[01:16:24.275 --> 01:16:31.375]   People here, they're more interested in watching The rugby or the football or the cricket on TV than getting involved in politics.
[01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:34.957]  But voting is compulsory and a lot of people don't want to vote.
[01:16:34.977 --> 01:16:36.297]  They just go because they have to.
[01:16:36.317 --> 01:16:41.420]  So, it looks like Australia has been the guinea pig for the rest of the world.
[01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:49.265]  In particular, the cities of Melbourne, where Monica Smith is, and Sydney, where I am, they've been hit very hard.
[01:16:49.805 --> 01:17:01.225]   Now, they've targeted their experiments and their attacks on the multicultural communities, on the religious communities, We know in Australia that those communities have been targeted especially.
[01:17:01.665 --> 01:17:02.766]  They've targeted churches.
[01:17:03.226 --> 01:17:04.227]  They've closed churches.
[01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:05.688]  They've closed mosques.
[01:17:06.049 --> 01:17:12.313]  People are being denied the right to receive Holy Communion, to pray together, to go to funerals.
[01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:15.475]  People can't say goodbye to their loved ones at the cemetery.
[01:17:15.696 --> 01:17:17.497]  There are people getting arrested at the cemetery.
[01:17:17.984 --> 01:17:23.331]  There are people that are being denied basic medical rights.
[01:17:23.371 --> 01:17:24.513]  They can't visit their doctor.
[01:17:24.553 --> 01:17:25.554]  They can't visit a hospital.
[01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.538]  So this is just an exercise in total martial law.
[01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:29.960]  I want to get Ms.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.901]  Schmidt's take on that.
[01:17:31.181 --> 01:17:32.743]  Why do you think Australia was a beta test?
[01:17:32.783 --> 01:17:34.786]  Why do you think they targeted your town the most?
[01:17:38.109 --> 01:17:43.855]  I think that, and I heard Simon saying, that we are very laid back people and we've had it very easy.
[01:17:45.257 --> 01:17:53.585]  For the last, you know, since the Eureka Stockade, really, we haven't had to fight too much for our freedoms and for the leisurely life that we live.
[01:17:54.286 --> 01:17:55.807]  I think we were perfect for it.
[01:17:56.287 --> 01:17:58.088]  And we are very, she'll be right.
[01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:59.609]  Nothing really bothers us.
[01:17:59.669 --> 01:18:02.571]  We just, you know, we just grit it and we just keep going.
[01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.314]  We're very friendly and I think that's one of the reasons why.
[01:18:06.434 --> 01:18:10.636]  And I know that we're talking a lot about the negative side of things and it's true.
[01:18:10.696 --> 01:18:14.419]  We can't go to everything that we can't do, Alex, is to do with our health.
[01:18:14.959 --> 01:18:19.102]  Every single thing we cannot do is helping our mental state.
[01:18:19.122 --> 01:18:25.421]   So everything that helps us, communities, groups, exercise, everything is anti-health and it's to
[01:18:25.421 --> 01:18:28.691]  break us psychologically.
[01:18:28.691 --> 01:18:33.131]   So we're in a psychological warfare, I mean you talk about that, we all talk about that.
[01:18:33.131 --> 01:18:36.371]   Sometimes it's easier when it's actually with physical weapons because then you can see
[01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:41.490]   the tyranny, but it's psychological and I think the way that we're going to beat it
[01:18:41.490 --> 01:18:43.530]  is with our psyche as well.
[01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:57.775]   So we have to have courage of conviction as a collective unit, country and world to actually beat them because what they're trying to do is beat us down psychologically so that we feel like we've already lost because If we think we've lost, well, then we're going to lose, aren't we?
[01:18:57.975 --> 01:18:58.255]  That's right.
[01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:10.723]  For those who don't know, it's a standard psychological oppression to create mass depression and mass psychosis, to put pressure on, take pressure off, put pressure on, take pressure off, and always squeeze down harder as you go.
[01:19:11.443 --> 01:19:14.405]  And then it's like boot camp, put you through hell, but now you're part of the team.
[01:19:14.805 --> 01:19:26.312]  They are putting you through hell to then accept the new digital pass, the new vaccine pass, which they admit publicly, and Australia is the test zone, right where you're at, to then be the new carbon tracker for the new corporate governance.
[01:19:26.392 --> 01:19:37.138]  I mean, this is a corporate takeover of our bodies, and then to track and trace this for a neo-feudalist system, because the world was rejecting their program, so they launched Operation Lockstep.
[01:19:37.178 --> 01:19:39.500]  I mean, I think it's clear you guys know that.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.202]  And you're victims of it.
[01:19:41.222 --> 01:19:46.389]  I think it's key to get the word out to leaders and others around the world, the people, that this is a war for the world.
[01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:50.135]  As another Australian said, this is a global corporate takeover of the planet.
[01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:51.296]  Please continue, Ms.
[01:19:51.316 --> 01:19:51.597]  Schmidt.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:20:00.442]  Well, yeah, the vaccine passports, you know, and what you said about the uncertainty, it's a weapon in itself.
[01:20:00.643 --> 01:20:03.463]  You don't know if you can go ahead with your wedding plans.
[01:20:03.904 --> 01:20:06.625]  You can't even die because you might not be able to have anyone at your funeral.
[01:20:06.925 --> 01:20:11.306]  It's this constant not knowing what the government's going to do every single day.
[01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.187]  Tomorrow, the playgrounds might be closed.
[01:20:13.427 --> 01:20:14.667]  The next day, it might be open.
[01:20:14.707 --> 01:20:19.569]  And if it's open, you should be grateful because it used to be closed, but yet it's your human right anyway.
[01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:20.910]  You're right.
[01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:23.731]  It's absolutely psychological warfare.
[01:20:23.771 --> 01:20:25.432]  It's so interesting.
[01:20:25.852 --> 01:20:33.737]  So the last thing my Premier said in Victoria, Daniel Andrews, is that we've got this roadmap out of lockdown, right?
[01:20:34.117 --> 01:20:40.761]  And the exciting thing is, is by Christmas we might be able to sit outside of cafes, but we'll have to be vaccinated.
[01:20:41.764 --> 01:20:45.388]  But that's absolutely illegal to enforce anything like that.
[01:20:45.509 --> 01:20:50.495]  But he just says these things and hopes that people just get vaccinated because they want to go to a cafe.
[01:20:50.535 --> 01:20:56.343]  But in fact, it's totally discrimination to not let someone eat somewhere because they don't want to take a medical procedure.
[01:20:56.604 --> 01:20:57.605]  But he just says it anyway.
[01:20:57.965 --> 01:20:59.787]  So, it's that coercion.
[01:21:00.067 --> 01:21:08.214]  And especially when the shot doesn't work and isn't a vaccine and is a gene therapy and the countries with the highest vaccination rate have the highest illness rate.
[01:21:08.735 --> 01:21:14.740]  And then Australia had almost none of these illnesses, but now you're getting all these weird illnesses like everybody else now that they're taking the injections.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:20.145]  I mean, this is just, again, a crazy corporations with a world government plan going for broke.
[01:21:20.185 --> 01:21:20.946]  Sorry, please continue.
[01:21:22.245 --> 01:21:24.807]  Yeah, so basically, like I said, they're trying to break us.
[01:21:25.147 --> 01:21:26.708]  That's everything that I can say.
[01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:29.990]  They want to take everything away from us that makes us happy.
[01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:34.753]  Connection is the number one reason why people don't get depressed.
[01:21:34.873 --> 01:21:38.455]  It's the number one reason why people are depressed because they don't have enough connection.
[01:21:38.996 --> 01:21:45.380]  So they are trying to basically make the entire nation of Australia depressed so that we will do whatever they say.
[01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.929]  Now, tyrants don't negotiate.
[01:21:48.409 --> 01:21:59.116]  OK, so when when the people find a way around the system, which they have in Victoria, they set up cocktail, a cocktail route around the city that was all outside and people were wearing masks and everything.
[01:21:59.436 --> 01:22:01.217]  And our premier said, you can't do that.
[01:22:01.457 --> 01:22:02.698]  You can't drink cocktails.
[01:22:02.738 --> 01:22:03.698]  You have to, you know.
[01:22:04.118 --> 01:22:06.860]  And so these tyrants, they actually get worse.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.881]  The cleverer the people get.
[01:22:09.001 --> 01:22:11.823]  So they're just trying to break us and we're not going to break Alex.
[01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:12.963]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:13.823]  do whatever they want.
[01:22:13.823 --> 01:22:14.823]  Exactly.
[01:22:14.823 --> 01:22:16.383]  Trying to break you for what though?
[01:22:16.383 --> 01:22:20.302]  To accept the carbon tax, the ID, the digital app?
[01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.662]  But I mean it's so damn obvious.
[01:22:21.662 --> 01:22:26.063]   Paul Swab says, "We will make them very angry until they submit to Great Reset."
[01:22:26.063 --> 01:22:29.222]  As if we don't know he's the one doing it for the Great Reset.
[01:22:29.222 --> 01:22:30.222]  Simon?
[01:22:30.222 --> 01:22:31.222]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:22:31.222 --> 01:22:37.103]   In regards to what can be done, I mean the Australian people are doing whatever they
[01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:38.463]  can do.
[01:22:38.463 --> 01:22:42.823]   You mentioned something earlier, Alex, which has really sparked my interest.
[01:22:42.823 --> 01:22:47.023]   I know a lot of our Australian viewers would be very, very grateful for this.
[01:22:47.036 --> 01:22:55.161]  You said that you're willing to go to the Australian Embassy in Washington and do some kind of a political protest.
[01:22:55.701 --> 01:23:04.226]  Now, I just want to underscore, and I'm sure Monica would agree with me here, and so would millions of Australians who are going to be watching this, that is such a great thing.
[01:23:04.506 --> 01:23:06.187]  That is exactly what we need.
[01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:18.306]   We need For our friends and our allies overseas, especially the Americans who are very close to Australia, to point the finger at the Australian government and say, no, this is wrong.
[01:23:18.586 --> 01:23:19.787]  What you're doing is wrong.
[01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:25.573]  It's against all the values of Western civilization.
[01:23:25.973 --> 01:23:27.175]  It's against Christian values.
[01:23:27.195 --> 01:23:30.658]  It's against the basic principles of freedom and human rights.
[01:23:32.469 --> 01:23:48.643]  Just maybe a counter question to you, if you could take this opportunity to evaluate, and obviously there'll be many other millions of Americans who potentially could visit the Australian Embassy, visit the Australian Consulate, you know, bring the American flags, bring whatever, Aussie flags, bring signs.
[01:23:48.863 --> 01:23:49.904]  We would love to see that.
[01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:50.704]  Absolutely.
[01:23:50.724 --> 01:23:53.046]  Well, I mean, when I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it.
[01:23:53.927 --> 01:23:55.168]  And it may take a couple of weeks.
[01:23:55.188 --> 01:23:56.009]  I want to build this up.
[01:23:56.089 --> 01:23:56.969]  I may go to New York.
[01:23:56.989 --> 01:24:06.755]   You know, I thought about going and protesting because Bolsonaro said I could interview him In Brazil, and then I didn't think, oh, he's there, I should have gone and interviewed him, but I was in D.C.
[01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:20.898]  for the January 6th protesters that are a bunch of non-violence, still held in solitary confinement, and so I didn't go to that, but I could either, we could have a protest at the U.N., and there's also an Australian consulate, I know, in New York, or we could do the one in D.C.
[01:24:20.959 --> 01:24:38.307]   or do both, but yeah, we need to get everybody out to do that, because that's something the press is going to cover, and they're watching and testing again, In Australia and in the 50th state of Hawaii, as well, is under a very draconian system.
[01:24:38.527 --> 01:24:40.669]  So they love islands because you have nowhere to run.
[01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:43.532]  We really need the international community to step up here.
[01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:47.135]  Look, Australia has been helping countries all around the world.
[01:24:47.295 --> 01:24:48.676]  Our troops have been going overseas.
[01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:55.061]  Australia's been donating money and aid for all sorts of natural disasters and so forth.
[01:24:55.342 --> 01:24:56.663]  Australia's never really asked for help.
[01:24:57.805 --> 01:25:03.049]  Sir, you're under globalist New World Order takeover.
[01:25:03.249 --> 01:25:04.490]  It's a scientific test.
[01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:05.331]  You are us.
[01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:08.613]  You're like part of our heart or our arm and we are yours.
[01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:12.276]  They're attacking me right now when they attack you and when they threw Ms.
[01:25:13.257 --> 01:25:16.059]  Schmidt into that gulag.
[01:25:16.299 --> 01:25:17.259]  Can you speak to that?
[01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:18.760]  This is only the beginning.
[01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:23.614]   They've been putting people on incitement charges for a year.
[01:25:23.634 --> 01:25:27.195]  So this has been their tactic to actually silence people who have a platform.
[01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.576]  So you would have heard of Craig Kelly as well.
[01:25:30.156 --> 01:25:32.337]  He's a political member of Parliament.
[01:25:32.417 --> 01:25:33.637]  He was taken off Facebook.
[01:25:34.237 --> 01:25:36.258]  He gets slammed in the media all the time.
[01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:37.578]  So this is just the beginning.
[01:25:38.158 --> 01:25:45.101]  They're trying to obviously stop people from speaking out of fear that they will get treated really badly from the media and so forth.
[01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:49.222]  And then, of course, with the protests as the days went on, the police got more and more brutal.
[01:25:49.422 --> 01:25:51.702]  seemingly to try and scare people.
[01:25:51.702 --> 01:25:55.982]   So this is just the beginning and tyrants don't negotiate, they just get harder.
[01:25:55.982 --> 01:25:58.781]  So it is going to get harder, this is not the end at all.
[01:25:58.781 --> 01:26:04.181]   So anything America can do would be absolutely fantastic because I don't know, maybe some
[01:26:04.181 --> 01:26:06.641]  people are going to have to die for this.
[01:26:06.641 --> 01:26:08.822]  It's getting really serious here.
[01:26:08.822 --> 01:26:12.981]   The protesting is very violent and it's not coming from the people, it's coming from the
[01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:13.982]  police.
[01:26:13.982 --> 01:26:17.141]  But the people have to defend themselves as well.
[01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:18.852]  So it's a very difficult situation here.
[01:26:19.273 --> 01:26:27.059]  And I would love to be able to stop that from happening, escalating into actual death and things like that.
[01:26:27.139 --> 01:26:29.041]  But it's heading that way, unfortunately.
[01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:29.742]  All right.
[01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.503]  Now going to final comments.
[01:26:31.523 --> 01:26:32.644]  Take as much time as you like.
[01:26:33.125 --> 01:26:35.847]  I was talking over you earlier, and I'd like to put a promo out with you.
[01:26:36.074 --> 01:26:39.674]   you know, saying Monica Schmidt that same thing you said, they want to break us,
[01:26:39.674 --> 01:26:42.873]   they're not going to break us. And of course, I started interrupting like I do, because I get so
[01:26:42.873 --> 01:26:47.194]   excited. Restate that for us to make any other great points you'd like to impart to several
[01:26:47.194 --> 01:26:51.993]   million people that are going to watch this. Sure. Well, thanks for the opportunities.
[01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:59.471]  So, look, the tyranny and the violence from the police and the obvious draconian measures of the premiers are, they're obvious.
[01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:07.913]  You know, you can see them in black and white, but what they really want to do is break our soul and break our minds, break our will, because then we're very easy to control.
[01:27:08.253 --> 01:27:09.573]  You know, it's like with the vaccine.
[01:27:09.593 --> 01:27:23.936]   If you don't want to take it, but you take it to go to cafes or to appease your government or to keep your job, you lose a little bit of your soul every single time you do something that you know is against your conviction basically. So every single method, every single
[01:27:23.936 --> 01:27:27.656]   thing that these premiers are doing are really designed to break our soul
[01:27:27.656 --> 01:27:32.206]   just like an animal or a dog or like you know how they train elephants in those
[01:27:32.206 --> 01:27:33.055]  tourist countries.
[01:27:33.055 --> 01:27:36.896]  It's all just psychological.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:45.584]  So for me and what I realized in prison and what I did with utilizing my courage of conviction is it actually beat them in that moment.
[01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:51.266]  They tried to silence me and instead of silencing me, they actually made my voice international and bigger.
[01:27:51.326 --> 01:27:53.207]  So it actually did the exact opposite.
[01:27:53.607 --> 01:28:05.894]   So what I realized in prison, Alex, one of the biggest thing I realized is that Collective courage of conviction is going to be the only way that the world is going to beat the agenda.
[01:28:06.174 --> 01:28:09.095]  Now, obviously, you've said the agenda is in full swing.
[01:28:09.175 --> 01:28:10.276]  It has been for decades.
[01:28:10.376 --> 01:28:20.441]  And we are definitely behind the eight ball because we were all enjoying our lives and families and communities and not thinking that this would happen in our lifetime and maybe a next generation would have to deal with it.
[01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:21.282]  But here it is.
[01:28:21.682 --> 01:28:24.524]  It's not our fault that it's here, but it is our fault to do something about it.
[01:28:24.884 --> 01:28:32.708]  And the only way that we can is to have our own individual courage of conviction in our own states in life, in our own lifestyles, with our own abilities.
[01:28:32.848 --> 01:28:33.908]  Everyone can do more.
[01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.169]  That's what I did, and this is what you're doing.
[01:28:36.209 --> 01:28:40.832]  This is your role in the fight, Alex, and everyone has their own role, whether small or big.
[01:28:41.892 --> 01:28:48.396]  It's if you want to get them, you know, if you want to spite them, then have courage of conviction and just say no.
[01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:49.077]  And guess what?
[01:28:49.377 --> 01:28:49.938]  You'll love it.
[01:28:49.978 --> 01:28:54.260]  You'll feel super empowered and you'll become a better person for it and you will never look back.
[01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:56.502]  So that would be my last comment, Alex.
[01:28:57.403 --> 01:28:58.203]  And we will win.
[01:28:58.223 --> 01:28:59.604]  I believe we will win.
[01:28:59.644 --> 01:29:00.525]  Beautifully said.
[01:29:00.565 --> 01:29:01.165]  Thank you again.
[01:29:01.205 --> 01:29:03.907]  What time is it in your region of Australia right now?
[01:29:04.847 --> 01:29:06.511]  I think it's quarter past five.
[01:29:07.373 --> 01:29:09.158]  OK, so the birds are about to wake up.
[01:29:09.258 --> 01:29:09.459]  All right.
[01:29:09.479 --> 01:29:12.506]  Well, I hope to someday visit you when Australia is a free country.
[01:29:12.526 --> 01:29:13.469]  I always wanted to do it.
[01:29:13.922 --> 01:29:17.643]  I've just been so busy in the fight here knowing this was coming because it's in their own documents.
[01:29:17.663 --> 01:29:21.444]  I'm sure you've seen this, but Klaus Schwab says we've captured all the democracies.
[01:29:21.484 --> 01:29:22.564]  We've captured the countries.
[01:29:22.884 --> 01:29:25.825]  So he's diametrically opposed to your reignite democracy movement.
[01:29:26.225 --> 01:29:35.428]  So it should be quite easy if you just explain to people this is an outside force and everybody should duplicate what you're doing in their countries like Canada and blue cities in the US and Europe.
[01:29:36.008 --> 01:29:40.930]  And should create these registries of people that stand free and open to band together their strength in that.
[01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.311]  All right, Monica, I really want to thank you.
[01:29:43.331 --> 01:29:44.891]  Congratulations on getting engaged.
[01:29:44.931 --> 01:29:46.112]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:46.692 --> 01:29:47.792]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:29:48.373 --> 01:29:49.073]  Have a great day.
[01:29:49.353 --> 01:29:50.393]  Thank you, Monica Schmidt.
[01:29:50.493 --> 01:29:50.754]  Wow.
[01:29:52.913 --> 01:29:55.913]  They said two weeks to flatten the curve.
[01:29:55.913 --> 01:30:02.913]  And trust the science.
[01:30:02.913 --> 01:30:05.672]  (dramatic music)
[01:30:05.672 --> 01:30:15.673]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:30:06.854 --> 01:30:08.635]  They shut down the entire world.
[01:30:12.237 --> 01:30:15.237]  all for what amounts to the common cold.
[01:30:15.237 --> 01:30:24.836]  And those who questioned them were turned into criminals.
[01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:32.837]  [Music]
[01:30:33.247 --> 01:30:34.848]  It's time to wake up.
[01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:46.184]  Pre-order your DVD today and help stop Lockdown 2 at covidland.com.
[01:30:51.047 --> 01:31:05.597]  For the first time in nine years, InfoWars has produced a new major film, CovidLand, part one of a five-part series that details the globalist Great Reset and their medical tyranny takeover of the world.
[01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:09.504]  If millions of Americans and others see this, it will stop them.
[01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:16.409]  So get your copy today at infowarestore.com or covidland.com and make copies of it.
[01:31:16.449 --> 01:31:16.869]  That's right.
[01:31:17.169 --> 01:31:23.374]  Like all our other films, you are encouraged, you are authorized, we are asking you to get it and make copies and share it with others.
[01:31:23.414 --> 01:31:28.358]  And now with all the censorship, that's more important than ever because this will obviously be censored off the internet.
[01:31:28.738 --> 01:31:37.221]   Secure your DVD at infowarestore.com for $19.95 and get a free copy of Endgame blueprint for global enslavement that tells how the globalists
[01:31:37.221 --> 01:31:38.301]  set all this up.
[01:31:38.301 --> 01:31:41.661]   These two films are incredibly important. They're both available
[01:31:41.661 --> 01:31:45.301]   at Infowarsstore.com. There's also bulk deals on the film, so get it
[01:31:45.301 --> 01:31:47.851]  and show it at your local school or donate to your church.
[01:31:47.851 --> 01:31:50.542]   Whatever you do, fight back and don't roll over to Fauci.
[01:31:50.542 --> 01:31:57.301]   Have you ever bathed in an enchanted, mystical waterfall? Well, neither have I.
[01:31:57.301 --> 01:32:01.341]   But I do know what it feels like thanks to the ProPure shower heads
[01:32:01.341 --> 01:32:03.381]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:03.772 --> 01:32:09.915]  Let me just tell you, ever since I've been using the Pro-Pure Shower Heads, showering has never been greater.
[01:32:09.975 --> 01:32:12.616]  In fact, I look forward to showering now.
[01:32:12.896 --> 01:32:13.957]  But don't just believe me.
[01:32:14.437 --> 01:32:17.740]  Check out some of these reviews at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:21.463]  Debra in Pennsylvania says, Best shower head ever.
[01:32:21.723 --> 01:32:23.385]  Increased the water flow greatly.
[01:32:23.725 --> 01:32:25.186]  Very happy with this product.
[01:32:25.627 --> 01:32:28.249]  Phillip in South Carolina says, Owen was right.
[01:32:28.589 --> 01:32:30.511]  This is the best shower head that I have used.
[01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:33.654]  My skin does not feel oily when I get out of the shower.
[01:32:33.914 --> 01:32:36.896]  My skin feels clean on every shower that I take.
[01:32:37.617 --> 01:32:38.017]  Wow!
[01:32:38.597 --> 01:32:43.039]  Never knew I'd be ecstatic with a shower head, but here we are, and here you'll be.
[01:32:43.559 --> 01:32:48.061]  Why haven't I had one of these my whole life, says Chase in Austin, Texas.
[01:32:48.441 --> 01:32:49.922]  Seriously, buy this.
[01:32:50.242 --> 01:32:51.502]  You will not regret it.
[01:32:51.782 --> 01:32:52.503]  That's a guarantee.
[01:32:52.843 --> 01:32:57.344]  Brittany in Pennsylvania says, truly the best shower head I've ever used.
[01:32:57.845 --> 01:32:59.805]  Owen is not kidding about how great this is.
[01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:05.367]  I am very picky about my water pressure, and this shower head exceeds my expectations.
[01:33:05.788 --> 01:33:06.088]  Yes!
[01:33:07.228 --> 01:33:10.373]  Coffee in Ohio says, water feels super soft.
[01:33:10.554 --> 01:33:13.539]  I live in an apartment with well water and it is on the hard side.
[01:33:13.959 --> 01:33:18.607]  But with this filter, I can feel how much softer the water is on my skin and my hair.
[01:33:19.007 --> 01:33:21.632]  The best shower filter I have ever used.
[01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:32.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, even plumbers who have been in hotels and dealing with bathrooms and showers for decades are raving about this product as the best showerhead they've ever seen.
[01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:34.132]  It seems like a no-brainer.

[01:33:39.336 --> 01:33:47.943]  You may not have a beautiful waterfall behind you, but you can have one in your shower with the ProPure showerheads from InfoWarsStore.com.
