[00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:25.907]  It's Friday, November 19th.
[00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:27.588]  The year is 2021.
[00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:36.052]  And I think it's very important just to sit back and let it sink in.
[00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:40.374]  Very slowly, the incredible news.
[00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.836]  The US government and the British government
[00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:54.302]  Are both announcing that they are going to announce mandatory booster shots for federal employees, the military and companies over 100 people.
[00:00:54.302 --> 00:01:01.288]  The puppet president and the press secretary of the puppet have said, ignore the federal court.
[00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:03.770]  The mandate goes ahead.
[00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.851]  Quote, business as usual.
[00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.295]  I have the video of that.
[00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:10.215]  It's just insane.
[00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.516]  And the letter went out last night.
[00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.258]  I've got the article right here in the actual letter.
[00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:19.744]  Where everybody's going to basically be reprimanded and kicked out of the military.
[00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.205]  It's just short of a dishonorable discharge.
[00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.906]  But you'll have a bad record if you don't take the shot.
[00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:28.166]  And they're saying it may be 10 shots, it may be 20 shots.
[00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.747]  You're just going to take in your body what we want, when we want.
[00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:35.468]  And you add that to the documents even coming out in the Washington Post.
[00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:36.648]  Well, they're very proud of it.
[00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:42.870]  They're like, yeah, Pfizer has secret agreements and runs the media, runs the government, and can even override Congress and the Senate and the President.
[00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:45.929]  Well, you can't sign stuff like that.
[00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.952]  I mean, sure, OK, Trump did that.
[00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:50.673]  They put Warp Speed in front of him.
[00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:54.497]  He didn't really know what the thousands of pages of secret agreements are.
[00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:59.642]  But we've got to just move past that and admit Trump screwed the pooch.
[00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:00.783]  And we've got to stop this.
[00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.050]  That's how Trump can salvage himself.
[00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.690]  We need Trump.
[00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.631]  He's a good guy overall.
[00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:08.652]  We need him to get good patriots elected.
[00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:22.100]  But look at this one in Virginia, betraying conservatives, coming out and saying, you know, let them push forced inoculations and lockdowns and masks in the blue cities, which is all the major cities of the great state of Virginia.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.180]  So more of the same.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.941]  It's just a nightmare scenario.
[00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:27.503]  But look at these headlines.
[00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.244]  Official Public Health England
[00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:37.853]  Says COVID infection rates higher in vaxxed than unvaxxed, and there's higher hospitalizations and higher death rates.
[00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:42.956]  And it's got all the graphs and all the numbers linked directly to them on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:48.300]  And big articles laying it out again, detailing it.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.623]  And then here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:51.623 --> 00:02:55.726]  Austria makes COVID vaccine mandatory vows penalties for those who resist.
[00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:58.508]  Thousands arrested for going outside without authorization.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.142]  Here's one here in the United States, NBC News.
[00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:06.105]  Hospitalizations rising among fully vaccinated in the U.S., Fauci says.
[00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:10.788]  Yeah, so you're not less likely to get sick and less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to die.
[00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:11.689]  You're more likely to die.
[00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:20.315]  Remember when he said, oh, it doesn't actually stop transmission and it doesn't stop you getting it, but you won't die as much.
[00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:24.959]  Just made up, pulled out of his rear end, which is his mouth.
[00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:27.617]  And we have the real numbers.
[00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:34.621]  We told you this, and we told you 20 months ago, 21 months ago, that they would do this.
[00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:35.962]  Because it was already scripted.
[00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:36.663]  It was baked in.
[00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:46.850]  Pfizer told its shareholders two years ago, before this even happened, that they're going to have new vaccines for emerging viruses that'll be gene therapies that you've got to take multiple times a year.
[00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:51.738]  Austria, back into lockdown.
[00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:52.479]  Anger builds.
[00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.039]  Who's next?
[00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.320]  Well, they said, if I never got to it yesterday.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.922]  In fact, guys, make sure I have that on my list.
[00:03:57.922 --> 00:03:59.963]  Ireland said, get ready for more lockdowns.
[00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:01.323]  And Germany, more lockdowns.
[00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:02.504]  And France, more lockdowns.
[00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.425]  And the UK, more lockdowns.
[00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:07.347]  So get this.
[00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:13.110]  The boosters lower your immunity even faster and give you no protection in the major Israeli studies.
[00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.891]  In fact, they lower your immunity and make you get sicker.
[00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:16.972]  That came out six months ago.
[00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:24.514]  And of course, scientists we had on before they even started the injections said this is what happened, because it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy.
[00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.176]  And one that actually erases your immune system.
[00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.579]  I mean, this is not a good one.
[00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:30.603]  They've got the gene therapies that are patented that cure cancer.
[00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:33.258]  But it's unbelievable.
[00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.919]  But the public's not getting that.
[00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:35.780]  You can be assured of that.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.901]  You're going to get the poison death shot.
[00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:38.842]  So it doesn't work.
[00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:39.622]  It makes you sicker.
[00:04:39.622 --> 00:04:41.443]  So the answer is more shots.
[00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:45.326]  And Biden's getting ready to announce a third round.
[00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.868]  And England's already saying, you're going to have your booster or you won't be able to leave your house.
[00:04:48.868 --> 00:04:50.209]  Vaccine passport.
[00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.831]  It's worldwide medical tyranny, martial law.
[00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:53.872]  It ain't coming.
[00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:55.573]  You're in it now.
[00:04:55.573 --> 00:04:56.733]  InfoWars.com.

[00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:23.275]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:25.056]  Well, they've really got us.
[00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:30.761]  They've got us in their clutches.
[00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:32.643]  You got me.
[00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:33.144]  And I know it.
[00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:37.406]  And I am not going to be your slave.
[00:06:37.406 --> 00:06:41.009]  And admitting that we're going under tyranny is the only way to stop it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.731]  Admitting it and saying no to it.
[00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:46.053]  If you say yes, you will never get out of it.
[00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:48.855]  In fact, you will be slowly killed.
[00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:52.718]  Alright, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:52.718 --> 00:07:03.007]  Austrian police and army stand up to government's health dictatorship mandates will join massive anti-government freedom scheduled for Saturday.
[00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:08.795]  And we're going to be covering this article extensively and talking about victory at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:13.559]  And I'm going to post, I'm sure Jim Hoff will let me do it, but this article is so important.
[00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:18.224]  I'm going to post this article on Infowars.com, the link to them, but we need solidarity.
[00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:26.711]  And I'm just asking my writers and my crew and all the listeners to promote, to promote worldwide solidarity against this and standing up.
[00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:29.094]  And none of the soldiers ever shoot at the people?
[00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:37.853]  Well, it's that Viva Vendetta moment for real, and it's going to be a Ceausescu moment for these puppets, these dictators.
[00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:42.274]  They're going to be strung up in the town square, or they're going to be killed in firing squads.
[00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:52.738]  And I'm not calling for that, and I don't want to go down that road, but that's where this is going.
[00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:53.798]  Here's the problem.
[00:07:53.798 --> 00:07:56.919]  I've already war-gamed this, and they knew the police and military would start waking up.
[00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:05.858]  As soon as they start to wake up and take action, the Globalists are going to release a super bio-weapon.
[00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:13.880]  They may even use, which we know in studies they have, 5G that can push the oxygen out of your lungs and make you think you're dying of a pneumonia-like illness as well.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.901]  Your body has an autoimmune response to it.
[00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:18.761]  We know they've been testing that.
[00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:22.622]  And so they're going to roll out their next attack when this happens.
[00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:26.963]  And then again say, see, you better do what we say or we're not going to give you the cure.
[00:08:28.752 --> 00:08:35.854]  And then they will have a cure, actually, for that real weapon that they'll give the military and police that go along with them.
[00:08:35.854 --> 00:08:37.694]  And then they'll have them hostage.
[00:08:37.694 --> 00:08:40.375]  The military and police will even know it's the globalists releasing it.
[00:08:40.375 --> 00:08:51.298]  It won't be official, but they'll just understand that, hey, you and your families will have this, if you join us, and then they'll be prisoners, basically slave soldiers.
[00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:55.499]  So I've, look, I've ordained every possible outcome here, and
[00:08:57.794 --> 00:09:04.664]  If the police and military, when they do this, go under the control, then they're just going to slowly kill them as well later.
[00:09:04.664 --> 00:09:11.774]  The only chance we have is when they try this to be fully aware of it and have enough people that understand that there's no making a deal with these people.
[00:09:13.956 --> 00:09:25.364]  I mean, I've committed myself into God's hands, and I know every day is a blessing, and I'm very blessed to be here, very blessed to have known this crew, very blessed to have known my parents and my family.
[00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.206]  It's just been a great honor.
[00:09:27.206 --> 00:09:30.608]  And I'm not saying they're going to kill me tomorrow or next week, and I will never commit suicide.
[00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:39.175]  It's just that these are the times where you better enjoy every moment you got, because we are in an absolute, undeclared war against humanity right now.
[00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:41.256]  I mean, this is biblical, 100% Satan.
[00:09:45.003 --> 00:09:49.768]  So I'm going to get to it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:49.768 --> 00:09:54.714]  It is so amazing to actually be in this day and time.
[00:09:54.714 --> 00:10:04.765]  And so I have all these amazing, interesting articles that are very important and very informative and Kyle Rittenhouse News and Congressman Gosar News and all of it's very interesting.
[00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:08.076]  Joe Biden's going to get a colonoscopy for a couple hours.
[00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:10.257]  He'll be under, so Kamala will be the president.
[00:10:10.257 --> 00:10:11.918]  They all fetishize that.
[00:10:11.918 --> 00:10:17.402]  Oh, the first black woman is president when she's not even black.
[00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:21.345]  And neither one of them are running anything.
[00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:25.428]  They didn't get elected.
[00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:26.349]  None of that matters.
[00:10:28.578 --> 00:10:38.385]  What matters is, I have the British Health Ministry admitting that you are more likely to die, be hospitalized, or become ill if you have the frickin' COVID shot.
[00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:50.134]  And we know from the Israeli studies and others that those that take the third round are hundreds of times more likely to die than if you only had one shot or two shots.
[00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:53.837]  I mean, this is just devastating.
[00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:55.558]  And it's happening.
[00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:57.980]  And then what's the response of the British government and the US government?
[00:10:59.423 --> 00:11:07.786]  Oh, get ready for mandatory third shots, and you're going to have to have a vaccine passport on your phone to do this.
[00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:10.787]  And you ask, why would they do something so bold, so crazy, so insane?
[00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:23.312]  Well, they've already gotten away with, in places like Germany, kidnapping millions of children over the last 40 years and creating a giant system of pedophile networks, millions of children.
[00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:23.672]  Millions.
[00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:27.542]  Tens of thousands per year per town.
[00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:30.362]  Over, really over 40 years.
[00:11:30.362 --> 00:11:33.923]  30 plus thousand in one middle-sized German city alone.
[00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:38.884]  Taken from their parents and given to people to rape them.
[00:11:38.884 --> 00:11:46.045]  Under a interpolled NATO mind control operation.
[00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:49.686]  By the way, if you're a new listener, this is all mainstream news.
[00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:54.247]  Psychiatrists and psychologists taking children from over a million
[00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:58.612]  We're good to go.
[00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:34.301]  And it's a cute date you're on, and you bring her chocolates on Valentine's Day.
[00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:37.824]  Hell, maybe you get married when you're 16, 17, and start early, whatever.
[00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:42.987]  That's all demonized and horrible.
[00:12:42.987 --> 00:12:47.931]  But little children, over a million, hundreds of thousands per state,
[00:12:49.409 --> 00:12:52.893]  Over the decades, taken to create the new culture.
[00:12:52.893 --> 00:13:05.968]  And when you see the men's choir in San Francisco, and a bunch of them are convicted child rapists, and they're licking their lips saying, we're coming for your children, this is our family, this is our love, you will join us, you will love it.
[00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.429]  They are proud of it.
[00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:08.751]  They were raped as children.
[00:13:13.137 --> 00:13:15.678]  And that's how you create a new society based on it.
[00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:16.778]  That's how they took over the Vatican.
[00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:17.959]  That's how they took over the universities.
[00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:19.639]  That's how they took over the Boy Scouts.
[00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:22.340]  That's what this is.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.261]  And that's what the video is.
[00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:27.162]  It starts with two guys, four guys, six guys, and at the end it's a hundred.
[00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:30.323]  And they say, we're taking them, we're recruiting them, we're grooming them.
[00:13:30.323 --> 00:13:31.444]  It's the new love.
[00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:33.465]  Your children will go on Grindr.
[00:13:33.465 --> 00:13:38.326]  They will have sex with us.
[00:13:38.326 --> 00:13:42.228]  This was defended by newspapers across the country as a good video.
[00:13:44.753 --> 00:13:50.138]  It's because it's run by the people that run the CIA.
[00:13:50.138 --> 00:14:01.447]  This is a government level operation to end civilization as we know it and have a, get them off the screen please, thank you, a literal army of pedophiles.
[00:14:01.447 --> 00:14:03.549]  An army.
[00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:08.253]  The pedophile armies, a hundred million strong now worldwide at least.
[00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:10.055]  One hundred million pedophiles.
[00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:17.725]  That will kill, steal, that will do anything they have to to have access to your children.
[00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:23.130]  And then all their minions and supporters like these guys up here that think it's all cutesy.
[00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:34.641]  And I bet you all the tea in China, I bet you every dollar I got in the bank, I bet you my right arm that 90% of the men on that screen were abused as children.
[00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:35.402]  And you know it's true.
[00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:43.081]  And they all have the same weird affectations and all the weird same mannerisms because it's a cult!
[00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:44.761]  It's a spirit!
[00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:46.641]  It's a program!
[00:14:46.641 --> 00:14:53.923]  And that smiley face and those little piggy eyes is just the cover.
[00:14:53.923 --> 00:14:58.044]  That's just the veneer of It the Clown.
[00:14:58.044 --> 00:15:04.506]  When It wipes that smile off, those children cry out to God.
[00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:07.556]  And who comes to save them in God's name?
[00:15:07.556 --> 00:15:11.017]  Who stands up for them?
[00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:14.598]  Oh, don't talk bad about it or Chase will pull your bank account.
[00:15:14.598 --> 00:15:16.358]  Well, then Chase should have no support.
[00:15:16.358 --> 00:15:16.898]  Look at this.
[00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:22.139]  Chase pulled payment processing for Donald Trump Jr.
[00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:25.340]  Yep, and Trump put up with it when it was happening to all of us.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.421]  And I'm not even attacking Trump, but what the hell do you think is going on here?
[00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:34.462]  Our government has been hijacked and illegally signed on with a treaty
[00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:38.796]  With Pfizer and the UN to give them total power over everything.
[00:15:38.796 --> 00:15:40.357]  And a whole bunch of other countries did it too.
[00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.478]  Brazil didn't.
[00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:46.820]  Now they're trying to bring, at the UN, Bolsonaro up on crimes against humanity charges.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.961]  They want to execute him.
[00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:50.422]  Of course, he'd never get a trial.
[00:15:50.422 --> 00:15:53.583]  They'd kill him like Slobo in jail.
[00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:54.764]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:54.764 --> 00:15:55.124]  Stay with us.
[00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:59.323]  If you're concerned about the power grid.

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.521]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate
[00:17:08.604 --> 00:17:16.188]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:29.596]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:17:29.596 --> 00:17:31.837]  The tip of the spear is BAM.tv.
[00:17:31.837 --> 00:17:34.959]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.

[00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.991]  That's SaveInfoWars.com.

[00:18:00.589 --> 00:18:08.333]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda, and with spiritual warfare, and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:09.874]  It's all come out.
[00:18:09.874 --> 00:18:16.617]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.839]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:25.622]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:33.335]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:45.542]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[00:18:46.102 --> 00:18:50.004]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:55.708]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:59.510]  And we are opposing the one world government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.864]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:19:04.864 --> 00:19:06.926]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:12.410]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.511]  But we failed.
[00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:15.173]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:19:15.173 --> 00:19:16.674]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:19:17.014 --> 00:19:23.037]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:31.962]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.043]  So we've got an information
[00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:33.363]  I think so.
[00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:04.439]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:27.781]  So there's a civil war happening in our hearts and minds.
[00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:34.846]  There's a civil war happening in our churches, in our businesses, in our farms, in our ranches, in our schools.
[00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:36.087]  It's happening inside the Pentagon.
[00:20:36.087 --> 00:20:37.288]  It's happening inside the military.
[00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:39.729]  It's happening inside the intelligence agencies.
[00:20:39.729 --> 00:20:48.796]  There are a lot of good men and women of every race, color, and creed that make up society, but there's a lot of evil people right beside you.
[00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:54.520]  And you can't underestimate how many actual evil people there are.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.701]  I used to underestimate it.
[00:20:55.701 --> 00:21:04.167]  There's still a minority, but it's a growing minority because evil is recruiting and training and twisting people.
[00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:08.690]  There are also a lot of really good people that have not been awake and have just been in a trance.
[00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.752]  And there's a lot more good people than there are bad people.
[00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:14.134]  And our job is to mobilize those individuals.
[00:21:14.134 --> 00:21:33.158]  So I've got the most important news coming up next segment about the military and police saying no to this tyranny and how the globalists are going to try to stop that and block that and why they want to get the digital society in place up front so that they will then be able to get civilization to do anything they want.
[00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:37.279]  And what their real endgame is and then how the metaverse ties into that.
[00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:47.235]  But let me say this, it's very important when we're fighting this level of evil, to not let it get us down.
[00:21:47.235 --> 00:21:52.678]  And to not let it depress us.
[00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.839]  And when I say that, I'm telling myself that.
[00:21:54.839 --> 00:22:00.503]  God's in control, this is all a big test, and we should be rejoicing that actual
[00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:12.318]  Prophecy is being totally revealed and it's unfolding because that just certifies and proves we're on the right track that much more.
[00:22:12.318 --> 00:22:23.263]  Not to mention all the discernment and the spiritual experiences and just all the magic involved with the relationship with the creator of the universe.
[00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:26.024]  So that relationship is everything.
[00:22:26.024 --> 00:22:27.385]  And everything else flows from that.
[00:22:29.193 --> 00:22:46.246]  And I just cannot describe to you, ladies and gentlemen, what it's like, and I know a lot of you already have this experience, when you engage and fight evil and truly get lined up with God, how amazing the universe opening up is.
[00:22:46.246 --> 00:22:53.512]  I mean, the things happening in my life, the things that are happening with my mind now, are just unbelievable.
[00:22:53.512 --> 00:22:58.756]  And I can understand why God does not give this type of power to evil people.
[00:22:59.947 --> 00:23:05.390]  And I think that's why they hate those of us that love God, because they've got a good idea.
[00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.090]  And wow!
[00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:12.473]  I've always had discernment, but now it's just super strong.
[00:23:12.473 --> 00:23:13.673]  Very powerful now.
[00:23:13.673 --> 00:23:15.574]  And it's hard to deal with.
[00:23:15.574 --> 00:23:20.436]  It's hard to look at each thing and have such knowledge about it that it's just overwhelming.
[00:23:25.814 --> 00:23:45.882]  The only reason I tell you this is so you really think about how the magic of consciousness and God's gifts are just so incredible and one second of life, like Dr. Zelenko says, is just a precious moment in time and is a universe in and of itself.
[00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:47.003]  And I love Dr. Zelenko.
[00:23:47.003 --> 00:23:47.803]  I love him.
[00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:49.924]  And I love all of you.
[00:23:49.924 --> 00:23:52.325]  And we just have to get the Christ consciousness.
[00:23:53.547 --> 00:23:56.788]  I mean, there's an old Jewish doctor telling you we need the Christ Consciousness.
[00:23:56.788 --> 00:23:58.228]  It's real, folks.
[00:23:58.228 --> 00:23:58.888]  God.
[00:23:58.888 --> 00:24:00.709]  God Consciousness.
[00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:02.950]  And it's happening.
[00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.811]  And you either take on the spirit or you take on the evil spirit.
[00:24:06.811 --> 00:24:10.312]  I'm going to say this here and then I'm going to move to all the big news.
[00:24:10.312 --> 00:24:11.292]  I'm speaking from the heart here.
[00:24:12.774 --> 00:24:16.860]  I tend to get so angry and so upset about this and fatalistic.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.602]  We don't want the enemy tricking us into that.
[00:24:18.602 --> 00:24:22.307]  We want to be very measured with what we do.
[00:24:22.307 --> 00:24:24.310]  We do not want to be reckless.
[00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.972]  Believe me, I'm pointing fingers back at myself.
[00:24:25.972 --> 00:24:27.634]  I'm a reckless person sometimes.
[00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:28.215]  Very reckless.
[00:24:29.224 --> 00:24:32.126]  And we need to just have the Holy Spirit direct us.
[00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:33.127]  He's got to direct us.
[00:24:33.127 --> 00:24:46.576]  And we need to think long term because even though things look really bad now and things are out of control, I can see us pushing back this wave, except in a few sectors where they beta test their control grid cities that I'll cover next segment.
[00:24:46.576 --> 00:24:51.719]  And then the wave of liberty is going to push back for a while.
[00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:58.664]  And so we have to keep thinking about building infrastructure and in standing up and developing our own communities of thought and culture.
[00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:11.279]  And a physical land and assets and that God wants us to inherit the earth and God wants us to go forth and be fruitful and be successful and multiply.
[00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:16.782]  And so in the face of them trying to shut us all down, we need to become bigger, stronger.
[00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:22.365]  We need to push back against it and not use it as something that crushes us, but something that is there to test us and empower us.
[00:25:22.365 --> 00:25:28.548]  So I cannot stress to you enough how important it is that you support the broadcast.
[00:25:29.824 --> 00:25:36.568]  Obviously we're being railroaded by these political courts and all the things that are going on against us.
[00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:48.915]  And we can hold on in our current operational phase for years while other incredible avenues are being opened up and prepared on so many fronts.
[00:25:50.598 --> 00:25:52.240]  On so many fronts.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.626]  I'm talking about the chain reaction happening right now, not about physically what I'm setting up or doing.
[00:25:56.626 --> 00:25:58.488]  That's a very small part of this.
[00:25:58.488 --> 00:26:01.913]  I've already detonated our main weapon.
[00:26:01.913 --> 00:26:03.495]  And now it's having its effect.
[00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:08.140]  And I've got more weapons, culture weapons, preparing to detonate.
[00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:12.236]  And it's going to be spectacular.
[00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:18.797]  So, I'm just telling you, our most important work is coming, but we've already blown a giant hole in the enemy.
[00:26:18.797 --> 00:26:20.258]  We already won, okay?
[00:26:20.258 --> 00:26:20.878]  They already know it.
[00:26:20.878 --> 00:26:21.718]  They're pissed.
[00:26:21.718 --> 00:26:22.578]  They know.
[00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:26.759]  They know this broadcast, the guest, all of us together, was just a weapon.
[00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:30.440]  A big, long, super sharp, just knife right in their heart.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.220]  Feel that?
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.061]  And they're bleeding out politically right now.
[00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:36.262]  And they want to stab us and get at us and scrabble around and flop around.
[00:26:38.062 --> 00:26:39.263]  We're not like you Satanists.
[00:26:39.263 --> 00:26:40.923]  We're not worried about our bodies.
[00:26:40.923 --> 00:26:42.804]  We're not worried about how we look.
[00:26:42.804 --> 00:26:44.624]  We don't care what the news says about us.
[00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:45.525]  You understand?
[00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:47.365]  We care about taking you down.
[00:26:47.365 --> 00:26:48.246]  You understand that?
[00:26:48.246 --> 00:26:49.726]  Good.
[00:26:49.726 --> 00:26:52.207]  And I will, with God's help, take you down.
[00:26:52.207 --> 00:27:05.231]  So, I need financial support so that I can use the money we've got to run these operations and devastate the enemy further and just be clear-eyed and focused while I do this like a surgeon.
[00:27:06.423 --> 00:27:11.845]  And I need to hold at bay their little operatives and their systems and everything, so we need funds.
[00:27:11.845 --> 00:27:17.287]  So I want you to go to SaveInfoWars.com, it's GiveSendGo, and I want you to make a donation there.
[00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:19.948]  We're not even allowed to be on the other donation sites.
[00:27:19.948 --> 00:27:24.249]  The left raises tens of millions, you know, for literal pedophile books they put in schools.
[00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:26.650]  Those have been, you know, done by the big GoFundMe firms.
[00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:32.208]  I'm not saying GoFundMe did that, but you know, that whole genre.
[00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:37.072]  There's been a bunch of really sick leftist fundraiser stuff that's gone on on different outlets.
[00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:45.559]  We're just here trying to keep this operation on air, and make more films, and write books, and do special presentations, and fund more journalists, and many others.
[00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:49.081]  But it takes money, and I need all the money we've got coming in.
[00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:49.962]  I sold my house.
[00:27:49.962 --> 00:27:50.783]  It sold two weeks ago.
[00:27:52.987 --> 00:28:03.790]  And I'm putting all of that into the fight, and I am just liquidating everything I've got, which isn't that much, to just pour it into this to make sure.
[00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:11.892]  And then I need money to then hold off the wolves while I finish getting everything set up and prepared.
[00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:20.094]  I mean, we've never had this much knowledge, we've never had this great understanding of the enemy operations, and we've never had better insights into how to destroy them.
[00:28:20.794 --> 00:28:28.119]  So when I say destroy them, I mean stop their system, stop their program of killing everybody and literally raping our children to death.

[00:28:58.001 --> 00:28:59.222]  Hey, everybody.
[00:28:59.222 --> 00:29:06.468]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[00:29:06.468 --> 00:29:12.393]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[00:29:12.393 --> 00:29:13.815]  Horrible crashes and
[00:29:15.362 --> 00:29:17.623]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:29.729]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfolwarestore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.

[00:29:33.717 --> 00:29:42.380]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.841]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.

[00:29:48.722 --> 00:29:59.105]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:00.526]  I know you're humble.
[00:30:00.526 --> 00:30:01.226]  I know you're like me.
[00:30:02.193 --> 00:30:15.043]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:17.365]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:22.070]  It begins to dawn.
[00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:28.458]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.680]  The tip of the spear is Vandervelde.

[00:31:14.886 --> 00:31:17.228]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[00:31:20.956 --> 00:31:21.917]  It begins to dawn.
[00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:28.301]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are, and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:30.522]  The tip of the spear is Van Dot Video.

[00:31:59.122 --> 00:32:13.636]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[00:32:14.396 --> 00:32:19.619]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[00:32:19.619 --> 00:32:27.844]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[00:32:27.844 --> 00:32:36.068]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[00:32:36.068 --> 00:32:36.849]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:40.639]  We are crossing the Rubicon now.
[00:32:40.639 --> 00:32:43.902]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[00:32:43.902 --> 00:32:50.247]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[00:32:50.247 --> 00:32:52.289]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:55.892]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[00:32:55.892 --> 00:33:01.357]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[00:33:01.357 --> 00:33:03.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.304 --> 00:33:16.965]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:26.067]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.067 --> 00:33:34.889]  Okay, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:34.889 --> 00:33:37.450]  What did I talk about yesterday?
[00:33:39.155 --> 00:33:41.416]  What did I talk about at the start of the show?
[00:33:41.416 --> 00:34:00.264]  I said the criminals that run NATO and the top of Interpol are the corporate body set up at the end of World War II for the Marshall Plan in Europe where they were able, with occupied countries, to set up whatever they wanted.
[00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:08.468]  You know, France was never let out of occupation until de Gaulle
[00:34:10.438 --> 00:34:19.246]  Basically had a coup and kicked the NATO group out.
[00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:21.488]  And that's in the history books.
[00:34:21.488 --> 00:34:27.994]  And they actually also seized the NATO nuclear weapons that were being stored in France.
[00:34:27.994 --> 00:34:29.256]  I mean, people don't even know about this.
[00:34:31.343 --> 00:34:34.845]  That the French had to have a coup to get their country back.
[00:34:34.845 --> 00:34:45.792]  You just don't think the Nazis came in and crossed over the Maginot Line at the start of World War II in 1940, and that all the generals just gave up for no reason.
[00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:54.057]  They were Vichy, or they were going to establish Vichy France down in the south of France.
[00:34:54.057 --> 00:34:58.400]  And that's how Hitler, three weeks after the Germans invaded France, Hitler was
[00:35:01.087 --> 00:35:13.474]  Surveying and touring downtown Paris, driving down the road, and the majority of Parisians were hailing Hitler.
[00:35:13.474 --> 00:35:16.216]  That's because Hitler was so popular at the time, and the U.S.
[00:35:16.216 --> 00:35:24.900]  News said he was a great guy, and the British News said he was a great guy, because he was set up to think he was allowed to do all this on a secret treaty with the British Empire that later came out.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.963]  You're like, what does that have to do with what's happening now?
[00:35:29.997 --> 00:35:40.080]  Well, through the Marshall Plan, the takeover of Europe, NATO and these groups, private-corporate charter, was able to do whatever it wanted in places like Germany.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.640]  And you saw what it did.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:49.162]  Run giant, industrial-level, pedophile takeover to create a new culture of pedophile armies.
[00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:59.364]  Yeah, there's the King of England hailing Hitler.
[00:35:59.364 --> 00:36:03.028]  Edward VIII, but that's for TV viewers.
[00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:15.101]  So, when you see all this, and you hear NATO coming out with this statement, it's on infowars.com from zerohedge.com, January 6th, riot, an attack on NATO.
[00:36:18.715 --> 00:36:21.637]  And of course you know NATO's got spy groups and units here.
[00:36:21.637 --> 00:36:24.539]  You know NATO carried out the Oklahoma City bombing in 95.
[00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:30.824]  We don't even know the names of the NATO officers.
[00:36:30.824 --> 00:36:34.307]  With dramatic and overly self-serious gusto,
[00:36:36.821 --> 00:36:48.790]  Stoltenberg told Axios journalist Swann, I regard that as an attack on the core democratic institutions of the United States and therefore also on the core values of NATO.
[00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.292]  You can watch the video.
[00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:55.034]  The interview was recorded last week at NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
[00:36:55.034 --> 00:37:05.282]  Ironically, according to the same time Stildoski began the much belated, acknowledged and widely exposed as the mainstream, as a utterly groundless falsehood and hoax.
[00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:10.937]  I'm confident that our biggest ally will remain a strong democracy.
[00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:16.904]  Oh yeah, it's a real democracy over there with all the rigged elections in Europe and Germany and all the martial law and lockdowns.
[00:37:16.904 --> 00:37:20.308]  What a joke.
[00:37:20.308 --> 00:37:24.072]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:24.072 --> 00:37:28.357]  And it isn't like
[00:37:30.083 --> 00:37:34.049]  The United States and England won World War II.
[00:37:34.049 --> 00:37:42.882]  Globalist forces that had set Hitler up and were telling him that he was going to be the dominant new force, they were going to put the King of England as the head of the European Union.
[00:37:42.882 --> 00:37:45.546]  That's all official, by the way, in mainline documents that came out in the 70s.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.884]  That group basically double-crossed America, the UK, Germany, France, everybody.
[00:37:53.884 --> 00:38:02.130]  It was all about a corporate group using Hitler to start a war so they'd have a pretext to bring in the NATO-EU plan.
[00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.832]  And they did it all.
[00:38:04.832 --> 00:38:13.719]  Just as they used the virus and the fear of the virus and the deadly vaccines to break down society for a great reset, so they can build back better, they did the same thing with Hitler.
[00:38:14.963 --> 00:38:17.206]  So those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:21.831]  I just gave you a very brief, overly simple snapshot of things that went on.
[00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:24.875]  But you can go look up anything I just told you and it's right there.
[00:38:24.875 --> 00:38:27.117]  It's not even debated.
[00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:31.142]  But you're not going to get that type of information on the History Channel or Discovery Channel or even PBS.
[00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.285]  But it's in the mainline history.
[00:38:36.502 --> 00:38:43.445]  What does that have to do with the European Union today, and the tyranny, and the martial law, and the vaccine passports, and all of it?
[00:38:43.445 --> 00:38:52.930]  Well, it has everything to do with that, so that we as a people and as a culture, not just here in America, but around the world, understand exactly what we are up against.
[00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.712]  This is very simple.
[00:38:55.712 --> 00:38:59.814]  I told you a couple years ago, before they even released the virus, I said,
[00:39:00.882 --> 00:39:08.087]  They're going to use the virus, the virus as a pretext, and they're going to call it a new Marshall Plan, first for Europe and then for the world.
[00:39:08.087 --> 00:39:14.592]  And when they call for a new Marshall Plan, that's when you know they've launched their takeover.
[00:39:14.592 --> 00:39:20.656]  And of course, a year ago, they called for the new Marshall Plan, a global Marshall Plan to save the world from COVID.
[00:39:20.656 --> 00:39:27.401]  And that's just where they get $150 trillion of taxpayer money into a UN corporate world government system
[00:39:28.643 --> 00:39:51.534]  To establish a world ID and a currency control and a calorie control and an energy control that surveils by law every action you make to then establish high-tech neo-feudalism on top of the plan over all the economies and nation-states.
[00:39:51.534 --> 00:39:57.157]  And that's why you have an agreement with Pfizer and the United Nations
[00:39:59.281 --> 00:40:15.878]  To roll all this out and why the government's then secretly signed agreements giving Pfizer and Big Tech control over all media communications because we've been put into a permanent form of martial law or emergency.
[00:40:15.878 --> 00:40:18.841]  Now, as the police and military
[00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.435]  Learn that they've got to take 10, 15, 20 shots a year and then it's slowly going to kill them.
[00:40:24.435 --> 00:40:32.143]  They're going to quit or they're going to be fired and then they'll be able to bring in their own people who by the way are not going to be taking the shots.
[00:40:32.143 --> 00:40:41.153]  Just like we learned a few months ago that FEMA doesn't make their employees take shots when the hospitals fire half their people and then quote FEMA has to take over the hospitals.
[00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.971]  No, no, no, they don't have to.
[00:40:43.971 --> 00:40:57.977]  The hospital group makes you do it, then the FEMA people come in, then hundreds of billions of dollars of, quote, aid gets pumped into the hospital groups under the emergency, and now you've got federalization of the society.
[00:40:57.977 --> 00:41:10.042]  Take over the medical system, the most trusted group first, then you have a purge of the military with critical race theory, you have a purge of the military using the vaccine garbage,
[00:41:11.095 --> 00:41:12.475]  And then you've got them.
[00:41:12.475 --> 00:41:15.216]  You've only got people in that'll follow orders and do what you're told.
[00:41:15.216 --> 00:41:16.897]  You run off the smart people.
[00:41:16.897 --> 00:41:20.158]  And then you can go, wink, wink, hey, you don't have to do any of that.
[00:41:20.158 --> 00:41:27.560]  Just follow our orders in the future when we go out and deal with the problem, folks.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.061]  And by the way, this was all really just a drill to save the Earth.
[00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:33.722]  The carrying capacity of the planet has gone over what it can.
[00:41:33.722 --> 00:41:35.122]  They lie and say that.
[00:41:35.122 --> 00:41:38.543]  And we've got to reduce the population by the year 2030 massively.
[00:41:38.543 --> 00:41:40.704]  And so do you want to be part of the winning team or the losing team?
[00:41:43.476 --> 00:41:53.243]  And that's the deception, that's the deal that is then offered at that point.
[00:41:53.243 --> 00:42:07.894]  Now, if the military and police get too out of hand and start actually overthrowing these dictatorships that have been established, then a real bioweapon and or electromagnetic weapons or chemical weapons or a cocktail of that will be deployed.
[00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:24.177]  And then you'll have really large numbers of people dying and then the globalists with their actuaries and psychological warfare research believe that then people will kind of stop their revolution against this back off and
[00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:34.958]  You will then have to sign all these political agreements and things to actually be given the cure for the real weapons they're going to release.
[00:42:34.958 --> 00:42:36.579]  You see how that works?
[00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:42.923]  And it'll be fine with the citizens because they know the people that are awake won't trust the next round, the next group of shots for the new disease.
[00:42:42.923 --> 00:42:44.865]  And so we won't take it and we'll die.
[00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:47.006]  And then their people that follow orders will take it.
[00:42:47.006 --> 00:42:49.508]  They'll live at least a little bit longer.
[00:42:49.508 --> 00:42:54.191]  And then they'll just do that in different permutations until they whittle us down to nobody.
[00:42:54.191 --> 00:42:54.612]  And that's it.
[00:42:54.612 --> 00:42:55.512]  They're going to kill everybody.
[00:42:55.512 --> 00:42:56.433]  That's how they're going to do it.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.322]  For a fraction of the cost.
[00:42:59.322 --> 00:43:01.684]  InfoWars, get prepared.
[00:43:01.684 --> 00:43:06.889]  Mega blowout sale 2021 is live right now.
[00:43:06.889 --> 00:43:08.911]  The biggest sale of the year.

[00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:06.105]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[00:45:06.105 --> 00:45:22.859]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the Martyr of the Beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.382]  Future over to them.
[00:45:26.382 --> 00:45:28.143]  They want control of procreation.
[00:45:28.143 --> 00:45:31.105]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[00:45:31.105 --> 00:45:36.850]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:42.394]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[00:45:42.394 --> 00:45:51.941]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[00:45:52.935 --> 00:46:00.241]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being in line with God.
[00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:01.662]  I know you're humble.
[00:46:01.662 --> 00:46:03.343]  I know you're like me.
[00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:16.193]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:18.534]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022
[00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:23.214]  It begins to dawn.
[00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:29.597]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[00:46:29.597 --> 00:46:31.818]  The tip of the spear is Ban.Billionaire.
[00:46:31.818 --> 00:46:35.980]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is M4Awards.com.

[00:46:45.465 --> 00:46:47.146]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:10.962 --> 00:47:17.464]  Where are the clowns?
[00:47:17.464 --> 00:47:36.749]  Send in the clowns Just when I'd stopped opening doors Finally knowing the one that I wanted was you
[00:47:39.241 --> 00:47:42.722]  All right, let me get to the good news.
[00:47:42.722 --> 00:47:55.444]  I just laid out one major plotline permutation of the globalist operations and what they've already pre-programmed the public for.
[00:47:55.444 --> 00:48:02.966]  It comes from thousands of documents I've read in research just understanding their algorithm.
[00:48:06.388 --> 00:48:10.951]  But this is an establishment elite war on humanity itself.
[00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:13.833]  This is a depopulationist event.
[00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:15.794]  And that's all on record.
[00:48:15.794 --> 00:48:17.635]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:20.817]  It's on record that these shots erase your immune system.
[00:48:20.817 --> 00:48:23.819]  It's on record they give you blood clots and cancer.
[00:48:23.819 --> 00:48:30.343]  It's on record they go in and turn off the DNA, being able to replicate and cause errors.
[00:48:30.343 --> 00:48:33.705]  I mean, that's in mainline prestigious studies.
[00:48:38.444 --> 00:48:42.846]  And I've talked to a lot of top doctors and scientists on air that agree that's what's happening.
[00:48:42.846 --> 00:48:50.489]  And basically all the rest of them that come on say, or even other prominent ones that won't come on, they say, we're with you.
[00:48:50.489 --> 00:48:51.170]  We know you're right.
[00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.891]  We know it's a depopulation operation.
[00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:57.712]  And they'll start giving you all this evidence that you don't even know about on top of the evidence you've got.
[00:48:57.712 --> 00:48:59.593]  But you know, we're just the public's not ready for it.
[00:48:59.593 --> 00:49:00.774]  So we're having to fight them this way.
[00:49:00.774 --> 00:49:04.675]  What I'm telling you is there isn't just a consensus this is going on.
[00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.616]  This is known.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.564]  This is known.
[00:49:12.564 --> 00:49:29.481]  And anybody that plays along with this, I don't care if you're a colonel in the military, I don't care if you're a senior FBI agent, or a senior ATF agent, or a senior federal marshal, I don't care who you are, you are destroying yourself being part of this.
[00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:30.422]  And Librigan denial about it.
[00:49:31.417 --> 00:49:35.920]  Nobody is going to get out of this, except a very small group, if they're successful.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.101]  And by the way, they're not going to be successful.
[00:49:38.101 --> 00:49:43.644]  They'll never be able to carry this out now because of what I've done, what you've done, and what others have done.
[00:49:43.644 --> 00:49:45.506]  And that's not bragging, folks.
[00:49:45.506 --> 00:49:49.708]  They even admit that in leaked documents that they're never going to succeed now.
[00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:58.473]  And so all they want to do is just basically try to kill everybody, and then they're just going to live underground for a few decades until the surface gets cleaned up, and then maybe they'll be able to come out and reorganize.
[00:49:59.634 --> 00:50:04.236]  They're not in full control of Russia, so they want to hit Russia with nukes first before they even do this.
[00:50:04.236 --> 00:50:10.438]  I mean, this is all global domination, maniac behavior.
[00:50:10.438 --> 00:50:12.538]  Because these people all want control.
[00:50:12.538 --> 00:50:13.819]  They all want power.
[00:50:13.819 --> 00:50:17.220]  They're very OCD about that.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.881]  And they're battling for control of the future.
[00:50:19.881 --> 00:50:26.823]  And so, here's what you have to know.
[00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.344]  They're not going to stop until they're stopped.
[00:50:29.847 --> 00:50:34.868]  And we have to, every step of the way, come out and point out, hey, this shot isn't going to help.
[00:50:34.868 --> 00:50:35.908]  It's going to make you sicker.
[00:50:35.908 --> 00:50:38.189]  We told you that, again, 20 plus months ago.
[00:50:38.189 --> 00:50:39.749]  It's all true.
[00:50:39.749 --> 00:50:40.669]  We've got to go and explain.
[00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:43.290]  Now you're going to see the hospitals full of people dying from side effects.
[00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.470]  They're going to blame the unvaccinated.
[00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:46.810]  But the statistics admit that's not what's causing it.
[00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:53.552]  And you've just got to keep hammering and pushing because I go out in the street and so does my crew all over the country.
[00:50:53.552 --> 00:50:56.012]  People are on fire being awake.
[00:50:56.012 --> 00:50:59.273]  A large minority of people know exactly what's going on.
[00:51:01.198 --> 00:51:07.822]  A majority of people don't want the shots now because they know so many people got sick or they got sick.
[00:51:07.822 --> 00:51:20.669]  And that's why the globalists are panicking, really trying to force everybody to do it because they don't want a large group of people that aren't sick, who didn't take it, to be able to point out to the others that did take it, who did it to them.
[00:51:20.669 --> 00:51:27.693]  They want to just say some other future event is what's going to kill everybody with these soft kill weapons that are being introduced.
[00:51:27.693 --> 00:51:29.634]  But if there's a big enough control group that isn't
[00:51:31.226 --> 00:51:34.648]  Taking it, that's not going to work, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:34.648 --> 00:51:38.931]  So they planned this whole thing out, but here's the thing.
[00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:41.872]  They're not the only people with brains.
[00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:43.073]  We know what they're doing.
[00:51:43.073 --> 00:51:44.954]  And yeah, we're going to get attacked exposing them.
[00:51:44.954 --> 00:51:47.075]  Some of us are going to get put in prison or killed.
[00:51:47.075 --> 00:51:50.658]  But that's okay, because God's watching.
[00:51:50.658 --> 00:51:52.359]  And everybody's going to die anyways.
[00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:54.780]  You're going to sit back and watch them do this to all the children?
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.682]  Which they're already coming after and already killing?
[00:51:57.682 --> 00:51:59.383]  Trying to abort them after they're born with these shots?
[00:52:00.521 --> 00:52:08.342]  So, admitting the full horror, admitting where you are, admitting it's real, internalizing it, and then deciding what you're gonna do about it.
[00:52:10.819 --> 00:52:14.342]  And then moving forward is the best course you've got because you're under this attack.
[00:52:14.342 --> 00:52:16.263]  This attack is going to get more intense.
[00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:18.204]  The enemy is completely committed to it.
[00:52:18.204 --> 00:52:21.687]  But I can look at their body language and I can read their statements and their leaks.
[00:52:21.687 --> 00:52:23.448]  They are getting their asses kicked.
[00:52:23.448 --> 00:52:29.532]  And they've committed to this and convinced themselves they can win this because populists were taking over all of the world.
[00:52:29.532 --> 00:52:31.414]  Globalism was in deep trouble.
[00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:33.655]  Humanity's hopes and dreams were too powerful.
[00:52:33.655 --> 00:52:37.298]  We weren't going to accept the carbon taxes and the austerity and all of this.
[00:52:37.298 --> 00:52:39.339]  And so they've hit us with the virus.
[00:52:39.339 --> 00:52:39.920]  And this is now war.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:48.163]  And admitting you're in a war and admitting that you're under attack is the battle.
[00:52:48.163 --> 00:52:48.744]  It's a G.I.
[00:52:48.744 --> 00:52:50.565]  Joe statement, but it didn't actually come from G.I.
[00:52:50.565 --> 00:52:50.845]  Joe.
[00:52:50.845 --> 00:52:59.609]  It's an old Roman saying, and I'm sure it was said before the Romans, but knowing who your enemy is is half the battle.
[00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:04.391]  Austrian police and army stand up to government health dictatorship.
[00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:06.392]  That's what they're calling it in their unions.
[00:53:07.796 --> 00:53:08.616]  Mandates.
[00:53:08.616 --> 00:53:12.779]  We'll join massive anti-health freedom protests scheduled this Saturday.
[00:53:12.779 --> 00:53:16.240]  Already millions are hitting the streets in Austria and Germany.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:34.090]  And the police and military know it's crap, they're getting sick from the shots, they know it's BS, and it's the next phase towards going in there and arresting Hitler 2.0 Merkel, who would take hours to break it all down, but stole elections from the beginning, manipulates the parliamentary system, is just an absolute witch demon.
[00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:43.675]  Overseeing the giant pedophile rings, I mean, she is just a monster.
[00:53:43.675 --> 00:53:50.800]  And 25% of the Germans died in World War II.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.723]  And then in the next decade after that, another couple million disappeared.
[00:53:55.723 --> 00:54:02.588]  And just imagine the most evil people in the world flocked from our governments and the Russian government and others into Germany
[00:54:03.632 --> 00:54:08.196]  To where they could set up pedophile rings, sex slavery.
[00:54:08.196 --> 00:54:14.061]  That's why you always read and hear about the most snuff films are made in Germany and they've got parties in Germany where people are actually killed.
[00:54:14.061 --> 00:54:15.602]  That's all real, folks.
[00:54:15.602 --> 00:54:19.446]  I mean, Germany is just a hive of evil.
[00:54:19.446 --> 00:54:22.488]  Absolute hive of evil.
[00:54:22.488 --> 00:54:24.290]  And it just got worse after Hitler.
[00:54:25.427 --> 00:54:27.689]  And that's who runs NATO.
[00:54:27.689 --> 00:54:30.752]  You hear Germany is behind NATO, Germany is behind the EU.
[00:54:30.752 --> 00:54:43.583]  It's not the German people, it's that evil got in there and now has a stronghold there and has used the German people that are strong and hardworking but also follow orders to be the implement that launches the world government.
[00:54:47.836 --> 00:54:49.556]  And so you see what they do in Germany.
[00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:56.938]  30,000 children per average town kidnapped and given into sex slavery.
[00:54:56.938 --> 00:55:00.098]  And that's what they want to do here.
[00:55:00.098 --> 00:55:08.760]  Same people that occupied Germany are now doing everything they did to the Russians, everything they did to the Germans, is going to be done to us.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:16.221]  And we need solidarity with the Russians and solidarity with the Germans.
[00:55:16.221 --> 00:55:16.861]  Absolutely.
[00:55:17.941 --> 00:55:19.643]  Essential.
[00:55:19.643 --> 00:55:23.446]  Did my audio just cut out on there?
[00:55:23.446 --> 00:55:24.848]  Oh, I hit my talkback on accident.
[00:55:24.848 --> 00:55:25.889]  Okay.
[00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:26.910]  Thanks.
[00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:31.174]  So, you know, we're here covering all this really scary stuff.
[00:55:31.174 --> 00:55:33.817]  But once you just get over it, then you can start doing something about it.
[00:55:33.817 --> 00:55:35.318]  Because the evil is already going to be there.
[00:55:35.318 --> 00:55:41.244]  It's going to be coming after you with force inoculations and pedophile rings and 5G and GMO and hell on earth.
[00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:49.035]  USDA announced three weeks ago they're starting spraying the food with nanotech this month.
[00:55:49.035 --> 00:55:51.076]  Just in time for Thanksgiving.
[00:55:51.076 --> 00:55:51.857]  You're under attack.
[00:55:51.857 --> 00:55:53.558]  You're in a war.
[00:55:53.558 --> 00:55:56.179]  And you better just get that through your head and stop doing it.
[00:55:56.179 --> 00:55:59.842]  And the good news is the military and police, I'm talking to, understand what's happening.
[00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:06.241]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and talk more about this, and there's so much other news here.
[00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:06.922]  But I mean, look at this.
[00:56:06.922 --> 00:56:10.425]  NIH director wants consequences for vaccine conspiracy theories.
[00:56:10.425 --> 00:56:15.749]  So if you question him and point out he's a lying criminal running the Wuhan lab with Fauci, he wants you arrested.
[00:56:15.749 --> 00:56:18.071]  That's because the boss, the head of Pfizer, said so.
[00:56:18.071 --> 00:56:18.672]  See how it works?
[00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:21.494]  He says it, and now it's got to be done.
[00:56:21.494 --> 00:56:22.395]  I've got a better idea.

[00:57:37.432 --> 00:57:38.012]  I'm not.
[00:57:38.012 --> 00:57:40.274]  So we're going to have to fix the equipment going out.
[00:57:40.274 --> 00:57:41.215]  That's not me.
[00:57:41.215 --> 00:57:42.616]  I'm not actually hitting any buttons.
[00:57:42.616 --> 00:57:43.897]  Hands up.
[00:57:43.897 --> 00:57:45.918]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:57:45.918 --> 00:57:47.139]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.139 --> 00:57:48.300]  Info Wars.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:55.545]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[00:57:55.545 --> 00:58:01.490]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.891]  Horrible crashes and
[00:58:04.423 --> 00:58:06.704]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[00:58:06.704 --> 00:58:18.809]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfolwarestore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[00:58:18.809 --> 00:58:21.790]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[00:58:22.796 --> 00:58:31.458]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:34.919]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[00:58:34.919 --> 00:58:37.780]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:47.342]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[00:58:49.973 --> 00:58:53.957]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world.
[00:58:53.957 --> 00:58:56.900]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:10.852]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars in other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property,
[00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:27.197]  Energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence, and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[00:59:27.197 --> 00:59:32.979]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything.
[00:59:33.619 --> 00:59:42.848]  Not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[00:59:42.848 --> 00:59:45.490]  This is the Great Reset, this is what's happening now.
[00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:51.636]  I warn everyone, it's the only way to stop it.
[00:59:51.636 --> 00:59:55.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:29.554]  All right, we're back broadcasting worldwide and they have announced that the verdict has been reached in the self-defense trial of the century, the Rittenhouse case, and the hero, Kyle Rittenhouse,
[01:00:31.092 --> 01:00:40.943]  And as soon as the judge comes out and reads the verdict, you can put it up on screen guys if you want, we will go directly to it.
[01:00:40.943 --> 01:00:43.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, very important.
[01:00:43.386 --> 01:00:47.371]  And I was already intending to open the phones up to talk about really any subject you want to get into, but...
[01:00:48.953 --> 01:01:02.526]  We're going to have this verdict live, and so you're welcome to call in about self-defense, the Rittenhouse case, or the documents coming out that a secret agreement was signed by our government and other governments with Pfizer to give them dictatorial power over our government.
[01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:03.867]  I mean, that's the illegal treaty.
[01:01:03.867 --> 01:01:05.148]  It's treason.
[01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:06.710]  But that's the corporate coup that's going on.
[01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:07.570]  That's what globalism is.
[01:01:08.974 --> 01:01:15.322]  The fact that police and military all over the world are getting into solidarity, and then one of my crew members is recently retired out of the Army.
[01:01:15.322 --> 01:01:26.756]  He was explaining this to me last night and this morning, and I'm trying to get him to come on the show because he's better at explaining it than me because he was a Sergeant Major in the Army.
[01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:45.614]  But memorandum for C description and it's an order he says it's only for like an international incident and that once you're given this you know you're about to get court-martialed basically and so it's the type of thing that's been issued and of course we've got articles that explain it.
[01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:47.976]  Punishment set for US troops who refuse
[01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.239]  Vaccination.
[01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:50.399]  U.S.
[01:01:50.399 --> 01:02:03.215]  Army has threatened repercussions for soldiers who decline to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, saying that insubordinate troops will be barred from promotions, reenlistment, a number of special military services.
[01:02:03.215 --> 01:02:04.677]  Army personnel have refused the jab.
[01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:06.778]  We're good to go.
[01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:40.601]  Bars to continued service for all soldiers who refuse mandatory vaccine order without an approved exemption or pending exemption request.
[01:02:40.601 --> 01:02:49.004]  And so what they're trying to do is just bluff them into knowing that they have a right to question this and a right to declare their exemption.
[01:02:49.004 --> 01:02:56.126]  But again, I'm not the expert on this, but I'm told this is just over the top, unprecedented bad compared to what the news is saying about it.
[01:02:56.126 --> 01:02:56.786]  It's just crazy.
[01:02:59.562 --> 01:03:02.423]  It's designed to run all the good people out of the military, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:02.423 --> 01:03:04.263]  It's just that simple.
[01:03:04.263 --> 01:03:06.704]  And that's where we are.
[01:03:06.704 --> 01:03:09.705]  So again, we're waiting here on the Rittenhouse case.
[01:03:09.705 --> 01:03:15.467]  Imagine he's facing life in prison on the more serious charges.
[01:03:15.467 --> 01:03:24.309]  And the judge has dropped the illegal gun charge because he didn't have the gun illegally.
[01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:26.750]  He wasn't using the gun in the commission of a crime.
[01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.910]  But
[01:03:28.928 --> 01:03:29.589]  It's just crazy.
[01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:48.261]  Can you imagine the precedent that the left can run around burning buildings down and shooting people, attacking federal courthouses, and then the vice president, when she's a candidate, bails them out of jail and leads huge multi-million dollar campaigns to raise millions of dollars to get people out and have charges dropped?
[01:03:48.261 --> 01:03:50.142]  Here we go.
[01:03:50.142 --> 01:03:51.083]  Here's the judge.
[01:03:51.083 --> 01:03:51.924]  We're going to pause this.
[01:03:51.924 --> 01:03:52.524]  This is live.
[01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:11.441]  Alright, we're back and the appearance has raised before with a jury upstairs and they have notified us that they have reached a verdict.
[01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:13.583]  Anything before we call the jury down?
[01:04:20.655 --> 01:04:22.396]  All right, hit pause.
[01:04:22.396 --> 01:04:23.777]  This is live right now.
[01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:29.201]  It won't be live when we come back in a minute, but our stations don't like us skipping breaks and satellites are all pre-programmed.
[01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:30.722]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:04:30.722 --> 01:04:36.827]  We're going to come back in one minute and we'll go right back from the part there and play the reading of the verdict.
[01:04:37.347 --> 01:04:38.968]  Live here on air.
[01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:45.753]  And of course, obviously, I welcome the other co-hosts and people that are doing shows to go in studios and do live, uninterrupted coverage.
[01:04:45.753 --> 01:04:47.173]  That'd be a smart thing for Owen to do.
[01:04:47.173 --> 01:04:49.655]  If he wanted to, he could take calls out of the studio.
[01:04:49.655 --> 01:04:52.937]  The more the merrier, but I'm going to be taking your calls.
[01:04:52.937 --> 01:04:53.518]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:53.858]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:06.194]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:12.135]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[01:05:12.135 --> 01:05:13.536]  Horrible crashes and
[01:05:15.089 --> 01:05:17.371]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:29.479]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfoldworkstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:32.461]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[01:05:33.464 --> 01:05:42.126]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:42.126 --> 01:05:45.567]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:48.448]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[01:05:48.448 --> 01:05:57.991]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:04.173]  This transmission is certified vaccine-free.
[01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:08.076]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.076 --> 01:06:25.408]  Alright, we're back live, and we take you live to the Rittenhouse Self-Defense Trial of the Century in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the verdict is about to be read by the jury.
[01:06:31.909 --> 01:06:33.090]  And again, there's no audio right now.
[01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:41.417]  No one speaking.
[01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:46.501]  And again, they are waiting in silence for the jury to come in.
[01:06:46.501 --> 01:06:49.063]  There is no audio.
[01:06:49.063 --> 01:06:50.825]  Right now.
[01:06:50.825 --> 01:06:53.527]  Or.
[01:06:53.527 --> 01:06:56.970]  Yeah, they're they're talking, but the judge has the microphones silenced.
[01:07:01.772 --> 01:07:09.016]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we will continue as this unfolds to cover it while they're waiting for the jury to come in.
[01:07:09.016 --> 01:07:11.037]  A lot of suspense here.
[01:07:11.037 --> 01:07:15.679]  We've all seen what a hero Kyle Rittenhouse is and all the persecution and lies he's been through.
[01:07:15.679 --> 01:07:16.660]  We've seen the corporate media.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.261]  Why don't you put it back on screen for me, guys?
[01:07:19.261 --> 01:07:20.202]  Thanks.
[01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:25.124]  We've seen the corporate media.
[01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:30.067]  We've seen the corporate media do everything they can to throw this case to the looters and killers and child molesters.
[01:07:31.824 --> 01:07:38.868]  And we have witnessed them only carry the prosecution statements and just do all their corruption.
[01:07:38.868 --> 01:07:45.473]  This will be a major referendum against the left and the pedophile armies and all the BLM George Soros scum.
[01:07:45.473 --> 01:07:49.335]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see Kyle Rittenhouse's mother, who's been a guest on the show.
[01:07:49.335 --> 01:07:50.696]  She's a listener.
[01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:56.599]  And we'll be definitely getting her back on as soon as this ordeal is hopefully over and get Kyle on the broadcast.
[01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:58.360]  And there is Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:07:59.363 --> 01:08:06.848]  Again, I just am having a lot of suspense right now, as I know you are.
[01:08:06.848 --> 01:08:09.770]  And we will go to the audio as soon as it's there.
[01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:22.378]  We're just going to let you have some of the room noise there, so that we won't miss anything that is said or done here.
[01:08:22.378 --> 01:08:23.559]  And boy, you can cut the
[01:08:25.615 --> 01:08:26.536]  Suspense with a knife.
[01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:28.316]  This is how I feel all the time.
[01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:39.882]  I mean, I'm reading all the documents, all the admissions, that the vaccines are killing people, that they're designed to slowly kill people, that they aren't vaccines, they erase your immune system, and that you're twice as likely to die or be hospitalized or be sick.
[01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:43.424]  If you take them, the British government is now admitting all this.
[01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:45.505]  And it's just, it's crazy.
[01:08:45.505 --> 01:08:50.148]  And now they say, oh, you've got to have more shots.
[01:08:50.148 --> 01:08:51.889]  And so I don't know what to say.
[01:08:51.889 --> 01:08:53.729]  I don't know what to do at this point.
[01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.470]  It's just incredible.
[01:08:55.652 --> 01:08:56.593]  You know, I can't help it.
[01:08:56.593 --> 01:09:03.257]  I never do this for our radio stations, because we have hard-coded satellite feed stuff, but I'm skipping this break.
[01:09:03.257 --> 01:09:03.677]  Coming up.
[01:09:03.677 --> 01:09:06.639]  We haven't done this in a while, but we're going to skip this break.
[01:09:06.639 --> 01:09:10.021]  Stations can go to break if they want, but we're going to skip the break.
[01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:16.025]  Coming up here at least on our internet feeds and everywhere else, because I'm not going to miss this.
[01:09:16.025 --> 01:09:21.549]  So as soon as, again, they start speaking, you will hear them and I will be quiet.
[01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:25.310]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:29.314]  I mean, the boring times are over, folks.
[01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:30.695]  Business as usual is over.
[01:09:30.695 --> 01:09:35.420]  We are living in a takeover by evil at every level.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.742]  And that's what history shows us happens.
[01:09:37.742 --> 01:09:43.027]  It just goes in cycles and this is going to be the most insane thing ever seen on this planet.
[01:09:43.027 --> 01:09:45.129]  If the public figures out the vaccine's killing them.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.601]  For those of you in the audience portion,
[01:10:11.184 --> 01:10:14.987]  No, it doesn't need to be.
[01:10:14.987 --> 01:10:37.883]  There can't be any reaction at all, no matter how strongly you may feel, and it's understood that many people do have strong feelings, but we can't permit any kind of a reaction to the verdict, and as you can see, there's quite a bit of law enforcement here, and you will be whisked out of here if there is any, so just be aware.
[01:10:37.883 --> 01:10:38.804]  Alright, jury's coming in.
[01:10:41.246 --> 01:10:43.307]  Man, do you believe in America?
[01:10:43.307 --> 01:10:44.147]  It's all on video.
[01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:45.508]  They're still trying to put him in prison.
[01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:48.129]  A George Soros creature.
[01:10:48.129 --> 01:10:50.490]  Very same Soros operatives are trying to shut us down.
[01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:52.872]  Remember that, folks.
[01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:56.893]  Very same people are trying to put Owen in prison right now for peacefully being at the Capitol.
[01:10:56.893 --> 01:10:59.735]  That is the injustice in America that we face.
[01:10:59.735 --> 01:11:04.597]  Will the jury succumb to the satanic brainwashing?
[01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:08.419]  Or will they find him not guilty?
[01:11:08.419 --> 01:11:09.519]  Would you turn it down, please?
[01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:09.960]  Yes.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.220]  Thank you.
[01:11:13.191 --> 01:11:18.572]  He's telling them to bring him out.
[01:11:18.572 --> 01:11:20.033]  Yep, this isn't theater, folks.
[01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:23.654]  This is the real world.
[01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:26.254]  The real world, and you're watching live.
[01:11:26.254 --> 01:11:30.495]  November 19th, 2021, on this Friday.
[01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.256]  There's young Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:11:32.256 --> 01:11:33.496]  He's a lot older now, doesn't he?
[01:11:33.496 --> 01:11:39.317]  Looks a lot more manly now than he looked just a year ago.
[01:11:39.317 --> 01:11:41.098]  Trying to defend his dad's business and house.
[01:11:42.588 --> 01:11:48.991]  Facing life in prison.
[01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:53.974]  For killing a pedophile that was attacking him.
[01:11:53.974 --> 01:11:56.655]  And other men chasing him and shooting at him.
[01:11:56.655 --> 01:11:58.496]  The FBI suppressed all that.
[01:11:58.496 --> 01:12:05.760]  And MSNBC and CNN didn't carry most of the, or all of the, in the case of MSNBC, of the defense.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.581]  One-sided crap.
[01:12:07.581 --> 01:12:09.862]  And I have a whole folder here
[01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:15.540]  of news saying I'm guilty of stuff when it's not even a jury.
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:21.389]  That's their new move is defaulting people in civil cases and lying about them.
[01:12:21.389 --> 01:12:22.671]  Oh, Jones never showed up for court.
[01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:23.732]  Jones never gave us documents.
[01:12:23.732 --> 01:12:25.334]  Jones never did any of this.
[01:12:25.334 --> 01:12:26.075]  All of it lies.
[01:12:29.076 --> 01:12:31.918]  Then all these fools sit there and say, oh, he deserves whatever happens.
[01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:32.859]  He doesn't need a jury.
[01:12:32.859 --> 01:12:33.780]  Why?
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.201]  He didn't give the documents over.
[01:12:35.201 --> 01:12:39.344]  All right, members of the jury, have you elected a foreperson?
[01:12:39.344 --> 01:12:44.288]  Would you give your adjournment, please?
[01:12:44.288 --> 01:12:45.029]  Fifty-four.
[01:12:45.029 --> 01:12:45.729]  Fifty-four.
[01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:49.312]  And has the jury reached a verdict as to each count of the information?
[01:12:49.312 --> 01:12:50.633]  Yes, we have, Your Honor.
[01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:51.874]  One verdict and one verdict only?
[01:12:51.874 --> 01:12:52.975]  Yes.
[01:12:52.975 --> 01:12:55.137]  Would you hand all of the paperwork to the bailiffs, please?
[01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:57.299]  Yes, the ones that we didn't know.
[01:12:57.299 --> 01:12:57.979]  Everything.
[01:12:57.979 --> 01:12:58.500]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:12:59.935 --> 01:13:05.718]  Live coverage, InfoWars, Kenosha trial, the hero Carl Rittenhouse.
[01:13:05.718 --> 01:13:07.018]  May I see that tool please?
[01:13:07.018 --> 01:13:10.940]  November 19th, 2021.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.581]  Self-defense on trial.
[01:13:13.581 --> 01:13:18.323]  Self-defense on the chopping block.
[01:13:18.323 --> 01:13:24.406]  So many of our futures bound to this.
[01:13:24.406 --> 01:13:26.167]  The left, doing everything they can to suppress the truth.
[01:13:27.355 --> 01:13:31.959]  Fighting around the clock, calling a white supremacist.
[01:13:31.959 --> 01:13:38.624]  Everything building up now, to this moment, in time, right now.
[01:13:38.624 --> 01:13:40.805]  Will they be able to unleash the giant hordes of leftist criminals?
[01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:42.947]  I know Ryan will face the jury and hearken to its verdicts.
[01:13:48.783 --> 01:13:52.106]  The first count of the information, Joseph Rosenbaum.
[01:13:52.106 --> 01:13:56.029]  We, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:13:56.029 --> 01:13:56.950]  Yeah!
[01:13:56.950 --> 01:14:00.413]  As to the second count of the information, Richard McGinnis.
[01:14:00.413 --> 01:14:04.236]  We, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:14:04.236 --> 01:14:05.477]  Yeah!
[01:14:05.477 --> 01:14:08.720]  As to the third count of the information, Unknown Male.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.303]  We, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:13.064]  Yeah!
[01:14:13.644 --> 01:14:21.829]  As to the fourth count of the information, Anthony Huber, we, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:32.195]  As to the fifth count of the information, Gage Grossports, we, the jury, find the defendant, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:14:32.195 --> 01:14:32.855]  Yes!
[01:14:32.855 --> 01:14:35.296]  Members of the jury, are these your unanimous verdicts?
[01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:38.878]  Is there anyone who does not agree with the verdicts as read?
[01:14:38.878 --> 01:14:40.639]  You failed again, you murdering trash!
[01:14:40.639 --> 01:14:41.560]  Do you wish the jury pulled?
[01:14:43.055 --> 01:14:44.896]  Burn in hell, globalists!
[01:14:44.896 --> 01:14:57.242]  Okay, folks, your job is done, and we started just about three weeks ago, and I told you it could last two weeks and two days.
[01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:59.623]  This is three weeks.
[01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:01.824]  You were a wonderful jury to work with.
[01:15:01.824 --> 01:15:10.909]  You were punctual, you were attentive, and the forgotten six over here who had a very difficult job of
[01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:17.112]  Keeping from discussing the case... The left's intimidation didn't work, punks!
[01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:21.415]  All of you, you just... I couldn't have asked for a better jury to work with.
[01:15:21.415 --> 01:15:23.857]  And it has truly been my pleasure.
[01:15:23.857 --> 01:15:30.541]  I think, without commenting on your verdict, the verdicts themselves... That's a real judge.
[01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:32.342]  It was fair, it was real.
[01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:34.404]  That's why they're putting Soros people in everywhere.
[01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:37.826]  Texas elects judges, and it's whoo!
[01:15:37.826 --> 01:15:39.327]  Justifies the confidence.
[01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:45.208]  That the founders of our country placed it.
[01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.511]  So, I dismiss you at this time.
[01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:56.157]  You're never under any obligation to discuss any aspect of this case with anyone.
[01:15:56.157 --> 01:16:01.020]  And I guess he doesn't want part of this going out, so he cut the feed.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:05.043]  So we're not finding out what happened here.
[01:16:05.043 --> 01:16:09.567]  Because again, this is some private thing the judge once said to the jury without the media hearing it.
[01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:12.788]  But it'll definitely get reported on.
[01:16:12.788 --> 01:16:15.173]  We gotta find out what the judge said here, guys.
[01:16:15.173 --> 01:16:16.977]  Check other channels, check other things.
[01:16:16.977 --> 01:16:18.600]  Rittenhouse, not guilty.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.081]  Live feed.
[01:16:19.787 --> 01:16:27.830]  I wonder if the families are mad that their panel members aren't allowed to do what they want?
[01:16:44.856 --> 01:16:49.398]  About information and your safety.
[01:16:49.398 --> 01:16:59.323]  And I assure you that we will take every measure to ensure that that is... I love how our founders enshrine the Second Amendment so we can protect ourselves from commie takeovers.
[01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:05.686]  I'm going to talk to you for just a minute, not about anything to do with the case, but just about that sole issue.
[01:17:11.283 --> 01:17:19.149]  You, as they say, you're welcome to discuss the case as little or as much as you want.
[01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:21.591]  Any questions, anybody?
[01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:25.734]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:25.734 --> 01:17:27.896]  After four years, you're eligible for service again.
[01:17:27.896 --> 01:17:28.596]  Go hug your mom!
[01:17:28.596 --> 01:17:30.698]  It would be my pleasure to work with you.
[01:17:30.698 --> 01:17:31.939]  Thank you.
[01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.400]  Rittenhouse just got the hell out of there.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.922]  Yeah, please.
[01:17:37.378 --> 01:17:37.958]  Or in the library.
[01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:38.779]  They can send it to the library.
[01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.360]  It's not going to be more than a minute.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.321]  Or maybe it will be.
[01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:43.081]  Yeah, take them upstairs.
[01:17:43.081 --> 01:17:44.102]  That's fine.
[01:17:44.102 --> 01:17:47.184]  That's fine.
[01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:48.465]  Wow.
[01:17:48.465 --> 01:17:49.645]  You just saw history happen.
[01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:53.628]  They want the power to attack us, and we're not allowed to defend ourselves.
[01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:56.089]  That's why they want to kill babies before they're born, because they can't defend themselves.
[01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:58.971]  And why they're rolling out these poison shots, because they can't get our guns.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.022]  We gotta come in with country boys who can't survive on the other side.
[01:18:03.022 --> 01:18:08.866]  They can't starve us out, and they can't make us run, because these old boys were raised on shotguns.
[01:18:08.866 --> 01:18:13.730]  We say grace, we say amen, if you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:24.077]  So, the Second Amendment is for every American, regardless of race, color, or creed, that it's our right to defend our property, and it's our right to stand up against people trying to kill us.
[01:18:24.077 --> 01:18:25.698]  And the little fancy pants
[01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:39.947]  Soros creature with all his lies, all his intimidation, all his crap got beaten because there was a good judge who was appointed by a Democrat but that was an old school Democrat.
[01:18:39.947 --> 01:18:42.749]  Not now with these Soros judges folks.
[01:18:42.749 --> 01:18:47.111]  They will do anything and that's why we've got to stop the takeover of our local towns.
[01:18:47.111 --> 01:18:49.272]  We've got to stop all the Soros people.
[01:18:50.399 --> 01:18:59.325]  Soros spent a couple million last election and got almost all the people he wanted put into judgeships and the new DA who's an admitted communist.
[01:18:59.325 --> 01:19:01.927]  And so, I mean, and I'm living under it.
[01:19:01.927 --> 01:19:05.290]  People say, well, why are you showing Austin?
[01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:08.812]  Well, my family's been here since the start of the state and our officers are here.
[01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:10.474]  I don't have the money to move it.
[01:19:10.474 --> 01:19:11.634]  Give me five million dollars.
[01:19:11.634 --> 01:19:15.197]  That's what it would take to set up all this new stuff and move in a new place and do it all.
[01:19:15.197 --> 01:19:15.517]  Do it.
[01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.238]  I'll leave now.
[01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:20.162]  I'll move to like Northeast Texas, which is very conservative.
[01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:22.264]  Believe me, we need to get out of here.
[01:19:22.264 --> 01:19:26.646]  But, I mean, this is where we live.
[01:19:26.646 --> 01:19:27.206]  Okay?
[01:19:27.206 --> 01:19:30.688]  So, and you know, if I leave here, and they take over the next town, I'm going to leave there.
[01:19:30.688 --> 01:19:33.109]  I'm always going to keep running.
[01:19:33.109 --> 01:19:36.491]  But, Kyle Rittenhouse stopped running, didn't he?
[01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:41.333]  He stopped running after days of things being burned and people getting stabbed and killed.
[01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:41.954]  He said, you know what?
[01:19:42.961 --> 01:19:45.822]  They're getting close to my dad's house where I stay the weekends.
[01:19:45.822 --> 01:19:48.243]  They're getting next to my dad's business.
[01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:49.584]  I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna try to help people.
[01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.024]  I'm gonna try to put out fires.
[01:19:51.024 --> 01:19:51.605]  I'm gonna have a gun.
[01:19:51.605 --> 01:19:53.045]  I'm gonna defend myself.
[01:19:53.045 --> 01:19:57.307]  And then here comes a mob of people looking for trouble.
[01:19:57.307 --> 01:19:58.588]  Well, you know what?
[01:19:58.588 --> 01:20:02.049]  They fucked around and they found out, didn't they?
[01:20:02.049 --> 01:20:03.390]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.790]  Stay with us.
[01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:12.707]  Because you can't starve us out, and you can't make us run.
[01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:16.090]  Cause we're some old boys raised on shotguns.
[01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:20.615]  We say it's great, but we say it's man.
[01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:27.020]  If you ain't into that, then don't give a damn.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:33.767]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines, and the Rocky Mountains, and the western skies.
[01:20:39.732 --> 01:20:55.235]  It came out more than five years ago in his own company documents when whistleblowers warned the world that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook and to be depressed and alone so that avatars
[01:20:55.695 --> 01:21:02.057]  Or fake computer identities would be their only friends, thus taking full control of the user's mind.
[01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:21.924]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out with Facebook, claiming ownership of the metaverse and buying up hundreds of VR companies, and now trying to force its users and employees to solely live in a fantasy world controlled and orchestrated by Zuckerberg and the organizations that he works with.
[01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:27.908]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses here in the third dimension.
[01:21:27.908 --> 01:21:39.014]  And to do that, they're creating an artificial electronic prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control of our bodies and our minds.
[01:21:39.014 --> 01:21:41.176]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[01:21:41.956 --> 01:21:51.780]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up and that group consciousness is forming and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:22:04.065]  Everything that's being launched against us is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension and not just enslave us, but finally completely destroy us and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[01:22:04.736 --> 01:22:07.197]  This is beyond the satanic ritual.
[01:22:07.197 --> 01:22:09.999]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction.
[01:22:09.999 --> 01:22:13.821]  Because this is actually happening in the real world today.
[01:22:13.821 --> 01:22:15.862]  And we have discovered their secrets.
[01:22:15.862 --> 01:22:17.603]  We've discovered how to stop them.
[01:22:17.603 --> 01:22:26.648]  And we have put it all together in an easy to understand system that gives you the tools to not just defeat the globalists, but to transcend to the next level.
[01:22:27.188 --> 01:22:33.414]  It's so important for all of you that already know this and have already witnessed this for yourselves to understand.
[01:22:33.414 --> 01:22:46.047]  You are the leaders of the future that must go to the next level so that you and I and others working together can free the rest of humanity before they get trapped in this artificial matrix system that the Globalists are building.
[01:22:46.287 --> 01:22:47.548]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[01:22:47.548 --> 01:22:50.231]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:59.438]  Documents came out in 1990, from the late 1970s, where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar to The Matrix.
[01:22:59.438 --> 01:23:01.700]  And all that information is now public.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:13.911]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses, not just holding us in the third dimension, but actually creating an artificial slave system so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:23.082]  Humanity are not robots, no matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social engineers tell us this, but they are trying to turn us into robots.
[01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:27.447]  That's why in December of 2021, we are launching Reset Wars.
[01:23:27.447 --> 01:23:30.170]  Find out more information at ResetWars.com.
[01:23:42.113 --> 01:23:46.254]  Because you can't start us out, and you can't make us run.
[01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:50.576]  Those Muslim old boys raised on shotguns.
[01:23:50.576 --> 01:23:53.417]  We say praise, and we say ma'am.
[01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:59.819]  If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[01:23:59.819 --> 01:24:06.441]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines, and the Rocky Mountains, and the western skies.
[01:24:11.115 --> 01:24:17.663]  And we can skin a buck, we can run a track line, and a country boy can survive.
[01:24:17.663 --> 01:24:20.386]  Country folks can survive.
[01:24:20.386 --> 01:24:25.551]  It doesn't matter what color you are, you need to get back to the land and protect yourself.
[01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:28.715]  I had a good friend in New York City.
[01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:31.638]  He never called me by my name, just Hillbilly.
[01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:44.340]  My grandpa taught me how to live off the land, and his taught him to be a businessman.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:54.223]  He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights, and I'd send him some homemade wine.
[01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:01.640]  I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.583]  Well, the left are running around like a bunch of rabies-ridden rats.
[01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:33.527]  And they're gonna burn more stuff down, but that's okay, because now folks know they can protect themselves.
[01:25:33.527 --> 01:25:38.511]  And now they're not able to villainize somebody standing up for their rights.
[01:25:38.511 --> 01:25:40.673]  And it's one more victory we're gonna have!
[01:25:40.673 --> 01:25:49.761]  If you're a radio listener, you're not having to look at the left, throw fits outside.
[01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:58.492]  But now Kyle's gonna be hunted by these scum.
[01:25:58.492 --> 01:25:59.233]  He'll need security.
[01:25:59.233 --> 01:26:01.114]  I guess he's got his Second Amendment.
[01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:04.396]  I just can't wait to get him on the show.
[01:26:04.396 --> 01:26:09.999]  I know his mom said as soon as this ordeal was over, he'd be on the show.
[01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:13.221]  And we're just glad that folks are surviving.
[01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:16.503]  Don't take the shot and don't let the thugs kill you.
[01:26:16.503 --> 01:26:19.725]  Survive, my friends, and thrive.
[01:26:19.725 --> 01:26:25.168]  Well, let's open the phones up for everybody now, so you can respond to this and get into all the other news.
[01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:27.583]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:29.284]  International lines, dial your country code, 01512-646-1776, 011-512-646-1776, or 877-789-Alex.
[01:26:52.369 --> 01:26:56.473]  And we are going to take a lot of your phone calls today.
[01:26:56.473 --> 01:27:01.159]  I was already planning to have open phones, as I said, in the first hour.
[01:27:01.159 --> 01:27:09.488]  And I said on air, I predicted, it wasn't a hard prediction, I really think, I said, I think you'll be found not guilty on everything, and I think the weapons charge will be dropped, and it was.
[01:27:09.488 --> 01:27:12.190]  And I said, though, it's, I gotta, you know.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.723]  Bad feeling about them taking so long, but I think they were just very deliberative.
[01:27:16.723 --> 01:27:22.849]  They reviewed all the videos, they double-checked all the evidence, and they said, you young man are not a criminal!
[01:27:22.849 --> 01:27:24.410]  You young man are a hero!
[01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:31.677]  And doesn't that fly in the face of the narrative of the pedophile left?
[01:27:31.677 --> 01:27:35.100]  At the end of the day, they want to destroy our children and destroy our futures.
[01:27:36.513 --> 01:27:50.117]  And have big leftist mobs funded by George Soros terrorize us and have George Soros prosecutors put any men or women that stand up and defend their selves or their community in prison!
[01:27:50.117 --> 01:27:53.638]  But another big fat burn in hell, George Soros.
[01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:57.874]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:57.874 --> 01:28:01.016]  And then you're welcome to call in about all the other craziness.
[01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:15.424]  You know, Gozer puts out a little joke anime meme with violence against AOC, something that left us constantly, and he's censured by the House of Representatives, but then we've got video compilations of hours of them, you know, killing Republicans as a joke.
[01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:19.887]  It's all one-sided justice with them.
[01:28:19.887 --> 01:28:23.709]  It's all baloney, all BS, all fraud.
[01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:34.980]  The big banks, the big tech, the big courts, all of it working to suppress the people, believing they, just as they bought the country up with fraudulent money they printed up, that it's theirs.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:35.641]  It's not yours!
[01:28:35.641 --> 01:28:36.662]  Our houses aren't ours!
[01:28:36.662 --> 01:28:41.446]  I mean, under their system, our guns aren't ours, our children aren't ours, but they are ours!
[01:28:42.594 --> 01:28:44.255]  And we're taking it back.
[01:28:44.255 --> 01:28:46.556]  We're saying, no, you don't own me.
[01:28:46.556 --> 01:28:48.197]  You don't control me.
[01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:49.978]  I'm not your slave.
[01:28:49.978 --> 01:28:51.059]  And you're not going to disarm me.
[01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:53.160]  You're not going to put your poison garbage in my body.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.462]  You're the people that cooked up the freaking virus on record.
[01:28:56.462 --> 01:29:04.707]  So many people say there are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[01:29:04.707 --> 01:29:10.631]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[01:29:10.631 --> 01:29:12.032]  Horrible crashes and
[01:29:13.587 --> 01:29:15.870]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:27.966]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.

[01:29:31.943 --> 01:29:40.630]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:44.073]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.

[01:29:46.956 --> 01:29:51.159]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:57.306]  Clean energy without the big crash and it's available right now and it funds the InfoWars 360 win.

[01:30:20.664 --> 01:30:27.907]  On top of that, we also have DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the Coke U10 to clean out your cells, to boost your immune system.
[01:30:27.907 --> 01:30:30.148]  It's the Rolls Royce of this.
[01:30:30.148 --> 01:30:31.329]  It's 40% off.
[01:30:31.329 --> 01:30:35.651]  And now we have Super Coral Calcium Toothpaste.
[01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:46.115]  Similar to our previous Coral Biting Toothpaste, but even stronger, even more concentrated, it's now back in stock and discounted with free shipping at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:30:46.115 --> 01:30:54.458]  So many great products available at InfoWareStore.com, so please take advantage of these great products that enrich your life and fund the InfoWare.
[01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:55.499]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:30:58.502 --> 01:31:10.258]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[01:31:10.258 --> 01:31:13.002]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[01:31:13.643 --> 01:31:14.063]  I think so.
[01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:36.775]  Over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:31:36.775 --> 01:31:39.156]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:31:39.156 --> 01:31:41.036]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:31:41.036 --> 01:31:43.277]  It'll literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:31:43.277 --> 01:31:44.017]  It's amazing.
[01:31:44.017 --> 01:31:44.537]  It works.
[01:31:44.537 --> 01:31:47.038]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:31:47.038 --> 01:31:53.279]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:31:53.279 --> 01:31:54.539]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:31:54.539 --> 01:31:56.480]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:31:58.487 --> 01:32:01.349]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:15.338]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[01:32:15.338 --> 01:32:19.781]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:28.167]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[01:32:28.647 --> 01:32:31.388]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:32:51.814 --> 01:32:52.915]  Check out the new line.
[01:32:52.915 --> 01:32:53.475]  It's amazing.
[01:33:00.546 --> 01:33:03.153]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.774 --> 01:33:20.596]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:22.297]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:23.958]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:23.958 --> 01:33:29.961]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.961 --> 01:33:39.965]  You know, I don't like cheap dopamine hits playing video games where you kill the big boss at the end and you've been playing the game for three weeks trying to get past that final level.
[01:33:39.965 --> 01:33:41.106]  I mean, I did that when I was young.
[01:33:41.846 --> 01:33:42.106]  I don't know.
[01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:05.005]  A football team wins a game?
[01:34:05.005 --> 01:34:08.666]  No, because it doesn't really matter to me and my family and my future.
[01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:17.431]  Now when Tom Brady makes it political, doesn't wear a mask, says he loves America, doesn't like Black Lives Matter, now I actually will watch Tom Brady.
[01:34:17.431 --> 01:34:19.031]  Because he's somebody that has courage.
[01:34:19.031 --> 01:34:23.253]  Because off the field, he's somebody I admire.
[01:34:23.253 --> 01:34:27.315]  And then you can see what a great athlete he is, and then he's a whole person.
[01:34:27.315 --> 01:34:28.716]  And now I can admire the athlete.
[01:34:29.855 --> 01:34:34.578]  But I can't admire incredible athletes, even though I do admire them at a base level.
[01:34:34.578 --> 01:34:37.200]  I admire humanity and God's creations.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.461]  But it just takes it all away when they're jerks.
[01:34:39.461 --> 01:34:42.483]  It makes it worse.
[01:34:42.483 --> 01:34:45.325]  Imagine the NFL made up of a bunch of Tom Brady's.
[01:34:45.325 --> 01:34:49.267]  Not by force, but by free will.
[01:34:49.267 --> 01:34:51.369]  You know, that would have ten times the ratings it has.
[01:34:51.369 --> 01:34:52.850]  But see, it's controlled.
[01:34:53.755 --> 01:35:02.422]  So I don't get dopamine rushes watching the NFL or playing video games or porn or any of that.
[01:35:02.422 --> 01:35:03.222]  But you know what?
[01:35:03.222 --> 01:35:07.846]  I got a big fat dopamine rush when Kyle Rittenhouse just got found not guilty.
[01:35:07.846 --> 01:35:09.827]  Next segment we'll play that verdict again.
[01:35:09.827 --> 01:35:18.374]  Because that was defeating the media lies, the propaganda, the one-sided garbage, the Soros money, funding the riots, funding the prosecutor.
[01:35:19.736 --> 01:35:20.296]  And you know what?
[01:35:20.296 --> 01:35:27.960]  I'm up against the very same people trying to destroy my life, trying to just do horrible things to me.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.062]  And so I'm on the Rittenhouse team.
[01:35:31.062 --> 01:35:33.623]  That's a real field he was on.
[01:35:33.623 --> 01:35:37.605]  And I admire him and his victory is our victory.
[01:35:37.605 --> 01:35:41.127]  So savor this victory right now.
[01:35:41.127 --> 01:35:46.190]  Savor it and then think about all the victories we've already won against evil because of God's support.
[01:35:47.423 --> 01:35:54.527]  And how we can't let the devil win in the end or everything our ancestors did is for nothing.
[01:35:54.527 --> 01:36:01.431]  Because this is a 10,000 year long sudden death overtime Super Bowl for the whole future.
[01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:05.653]  And we just got in the
[01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:10.903]  The winning column with this.
[01:36:10.903 --> 01:36:14.924]  And with the police all over the world rallying with the citizens and saying no to the lockdowns.
[01:36:14.924 --> 01:36:16.664]  We're moving back in the right direction.
[01:36:16.664 --> 01:36:18.985]  Let's see some more of that right now!
[01:36:18.985 --> 01:36:24.226]  Let's decide to stop rolling over and stop giving in to evil!
[01:36:24.226 --> 01:36:25.846]  Let's decide to be alive again!
[01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:35.268]  And get past all the BS manipulations and get past all the concerns that, oh well, something might happen if I stand up or speak out.
[01:36:35.268 --> 01:36:37.208]  Something's gonna happen if you don't speak out!
[01:36:38.544 --> 01:36:40.325]  You're gonna be a slave!
[01:36:40.325 --> 01:36:43.167]  You think a nation of Rittenhouses could be enslaved?
[01:36:43.167 --> 01:36:46.389]  You think a nation of Rittenhouses would be prosperous?
[01:36:46.389 --> 01:36:47.890]  Yeah, you know it would be.
[01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:51.092]  So let's all be more like Rittenhouse.
[01:36:51.092 --> 01:36:55.295]  And that doesn't mean we go out and start some fight, or that doesn't mean we look for trouble.
[01:36:55.295 --> 01:37:04.101]  But it means that we don't get pushed around, and we don't let people mess with our children!
[01:37:04.101 --> 01:37:07.323]  So yeah, I'm high as a kite right now.
[01:37:07.323 --> 01:37:08.304]  And I'm gonna control myself.
[01:37:11.155 --> 01:37:15.560]  But I've had the very same scum sink their fangs into me.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.806]  And it doesn't make me want to back off, it makes me want to fight!
[01:37:19.806 --> 01:37:20.506]  Makes me want to win!
[01:37:22.005 --> 01:37:26.166]  And I know that young man's been put through more than I have, and all my years of being persecuted.
[01:37:26.166 --> 01:37:38.888]  And he rose to the occasion that night, and he rose to the occasion in the last year, and he sat there in that jail cell, and now, Kyle Rittenhouse, ladies and gentlemen, is a free man, vindicated.
[01:37:38.888 --> 01:37:47.149]  And the mainstream corporate media and all their lies have had a giant verdict of no confidence from the American people yet again.
[01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:50.250]  And all these other corrupt judiciaries,
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:38:04.909]  That dropped charges on Antifa that shoot people, but then charged folks that defend themselves now know what trash they are, and they see what a real judge and real justice looks like.
[01:38:04.909 --> 01:38:06.310]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls here.
[01:38:12.096 --> 01:38:14.378]  If you're a radio listener, I didn't suddenly turn into Beavis and Butt-head.
[01:38:14.378 --> 01:38:18.060]  They put up a graphic of... That's hilarious!
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:19.622]  Of the prosecutor.
[01:38:19.622 --> 01:38:20.142]  He is!
[01:38:20.142 --> 01:38:21.183]  He's Butt-head!
[01:38:21.183 --> 01:38:24.105]  Oh my gosh!
[01:38:24.105 --> 01:38:26.366]  Shut up, Beavis.
[01:38:26.366 --> 01:38:28.047]  So, why were you in Kenosha?
[01:38:28.047 --> 01:38:29.168]  You don't live there.
[01:38:29.168 --> 01:38:31.269]  My dad does.
[01:38:31.269 --> 01:38:35.732]  Come on, Beavis.
[01:38:35.732 --> 01:38:36.293]  Come on, Butt-head.
[01:38:36.293 --> 01:38:37.614]  Let's go whack off in the tool shed.
[01:38:40.435 --> 01:38:43.442]  You know, I'd hung out with Mike Judge in so long because I don't hang out.
[01:38:43.442 --> 01:38:44.184]  I don't go out to dinner.
[01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.086]  I don't go out drinking.
[01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:47.492]  He used to be a really good friend of mine.
[01:38:47.492 --> 01:38:48.956]  I mean, we hung out quite a bit.
[01:38:51.334 --> 01:38:54.575]  I've done more wild things with him than with Joe Rogan.
[01:38:54.575 --> 01:38:56.255]  But just in the war, I hadn't had time.
[01:38:56.255 --> 01:39:00.236]  But he's like, oh my God, I need to go have some fun with Mike Judge.
[01:39:00.236 --> 01:39:03.176]  I just get reminded of how funny he is in person.
[01:39:03.176 --> 01:39:09.798]  Imagine like driving down the road or being on his ranch eating barbecue while he's shooting a .50 caliber rifle talking like butthead.
[01:39:09.798 --> 01:39:14.919]  It just doesn't get better than that.
[01:39:14.919 --> 01:39:19.340]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls, but I'm kind of drunk right now.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:20.920]  I haven't had any alcohol, but I feel drunk.
[01:39:23.268 --> 01:39:26.490]  A lot of endorphins and a big weight off, too.
[01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:28.731]  I know you're feeling it, too.
[01:39:28.731 --> 01:39:31.012]  I may just go take this jacket off and put on a t-shirt.
[01:39:31.012 --> 01:39:34.674]  I'm just... Oh, God.
[01:39:34.674 --> 01:39:39.976]  Because, you know, there's a lot of innocent people getting hurt by evil right now.
[01:39:39.976 --> 01:39:42.578]  And so just because we had this victory doesn't mean we don't have a lot of work to do.
[01:39:44.363 --> 01:39:53.847]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come right back with Carlos and John and Brad and Steve and Steve and Alex and Robert and Jacob and Stan and others.
[01:39:53.847 --> 01:39:59.450]  One part of staying on the air and winning this war is you supporting us, which I really appreciate, but we need support.
[01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:05.092]  We're fighting the whole George Soros, Bloomberg, Democratic Party organization.
[01:40:05.092 --> 01:40:06.513]  We have a strategy to win.
[01:40:07.453 --> 01:40:13.601]  Not in the way that they would think is a victory, but staying on the air and actually expanding is the victory.
[01:40:13.601 --> 01:40:18.067]  So we cannot let them cut into our operation funds to expand the fight.
[01:40:19.506 --> 01:40:22.809]  They're trying to pin us down because we're key in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:40:22.809 --> 01:40:23.949]  So it's key.
[01:40:23.949 --> 01:40:27.632]  They're not making me get bigger because I'm doing that for them.
[01:40:27.632 --> 01:40:33.036]  But the fact that we're so persecuted reminds me that I've got to work 18 hours a day.
[01:40:33.036 --> 01:40:38.300]  And so films, so much more, collaborations, so many other things are going to be launched in the next few months.
[01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:43.100]  Starting with Reset Wars that you'll all learn about coming up in December.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:48.984]  You can go there and sign up for free to get special videos, reports, you name it, at ResetWars.com.
[01:40:48.984 --> 01:40:55.269]  But the big thing to do is to go to SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:40:55.269 --> 01:41:00.813]  SaveInfoWars.com and that is the GiveSendGo account.
[01:41:00.813 --> 01:41:01.634]  And when you go there, it
[01:41:04.628 --> 01:41:06.771]  Allows us to stay on air and operate.
[01:41:06.771 --> 01:41:09.174]  And it sounds like a lot of money, two million dollars.
[01:41:09.174 --> 01:41:16.143]  We have six different Democratic Party funded lawsuits that are going to go to trial in the next year.
[01:41:16.143 --> 01:41:20.148]  They run from March through, what is it, September.
[01:41:21.474 --> 01:41:22.575]  Six of their lawsuits.
[01:41:22.575 --> 01:41:23.675]  Four of them, Sandy Hook.
[01:41:23.675 --> 01:41:24.476]  One, Charlottesville.
[01:41:24.476 --> 01:41:26.136]  One of them's another one.
[01:41:26.136 --> 01:41:27.057]  That's a side issue.
[01:41:27.057 --> 01:41:28.598]  So five major ones.
[01:41:28.598 --> 01:41:30.258]  So they can just constantly keep it in the headlines.
[01:41:30.258 --> 01:41:31.719]  It's going to be on TV.
[01:41:31.719 --> 01:41:33.320]  I'm not going to be able to even defend myself.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.761]  It's going to be, oh, he's already guilty.
[01:41:34.761 --> 01:41:36.262]  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[01:41:36.262 --> 01:41:40.324]  That's what they do to respond to stuff like you just saw with Rittenhouse with a real court.
[01:41:40.324 --> 01:41:41.404]  But that's OK.
[01:41:41.404 --> 01:41:45.146]  People are going to see that outrage and just how over the top it is and wake up.
[01:41:45.146 --> 01:41:46.066]  That's what they haven't gotten.
[01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:50.609]  I have these media people call up, threaten me like, you better interview with us or we'll
[01:41:51.249 --> 01:41:54.651]  You know, the Bob Woodward rule, we'll really go hard on you.
[01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:59.574]  And I'm like, go hard as you want, make it as... worse is better!
[01:41:59.574 --> 01:42:03.017]  Give me my licks!
[01:42:03.017 --> 01:42:06.899]  You think you people have any control over me?
[01:42:06.899 --> 01:42:12.543]  You think you scare me when I know who you work for and you're in deep trouble with God?
[01:42:13.456 --> 01:42:14.436]  I fear God, not you.
[01:42:14.436 --> 01:42:16.317]  You understand that?
[01:42:16.317 --> 01:42:19.859]  Let me just get that through your mind!
[01:42:19.859 --> 01:42:20.979]  I just got to control myself.
[01:42:20.979 --> 01:42:23.160]  That's my only issue.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.461]  So, SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:42:25.461 --> 01:42:26.922]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:42:26.922 --> 01:42:27.822]  Going to be part of history?
[01:42:27.822 --> 01:42:28.923]  Going to be part of the fight?
[01:42:28.923 --> 01:42:34.285]  Quite frankly, again, it'll cost more than $2 million to fight this and the appeals and all of it.
[01:42:34.285 --> 01:42:35.005]  It's way more than that.
[01:42:38.044 --> 01:42:39.285]  This isn't like it's my decision.
[01:42:39.285 --> 01:42:44.228]  This is up to you whether we continue on at the level we're at or whether these people help shut us down.
[01:42:44.228 --> 01:42:46.009]  Even beforehand, we run out of money.
[01:42:46.009 --> 01:42:48.210]  Something they're fighting all behind the scenes to do right now.
[01:42:48.210 --> 01:42:50.151]  So I need money to fight these people.
[01:42:50.151 --> 01:42:51.972]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:42:51.972 --> 01:42:53.253]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:42:53.253 --> 01:42:53.973]  One word.
[01:42:53.973 --> 01:42:54.894]  I thank you for the support.
[01:42:54.894 --> 01:42:56.675]  Big sale at InfoWars store.
[01:42:56.675 --> 01:42:59.336]  For a fraction of... I know you're humble.
[01:42:59.336 --> 01:43:01.017]  I know you're like me.
[01:43:01.017 --> 01:43:05.160]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate
[01:43:06.266 --> 01:43:13.690]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have teached the world in incredible ways.
[01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:27.118]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:29.340]  The tip of the spear is Van.Video.
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:32.642]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.
[01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:38.135]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[01:43:38.135 --> 01:43:42.979]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:43:42.979 --> 01:43:44.501]  That's SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:55.772]  And continue to go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[01:43:57.828 --> 01:44:07.613]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID, and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[01:44:07.613 --> 01:44:20.999]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders' own words, they admit that once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do.
[01:44:20.999 --> 01:44:25.601]  And publicly, they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[01:44:25.981 --> 01:44:26.281]  I'm good.
[01:44:42.233 --> 01:44:43.935]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[01:44:43.935 --> 01:44:47.439]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and others are leading the charge, along with Infowars.
[01:44:47.439 --> 01:44:48.259]  But it's not enough.
[01:44:48.259 --> 01:44:53.365]  Every individual has to not comply, and we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[01:44:53.365 --> 01:44:56.648]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them, legally and lawfully.
[01:44:57.569 --> 01:45:02.410]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[01:45:02.410 --> 01:45:04.471]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[01:45:04.471 --> 01:45:09.953]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:11.073]  But we failed.
[01:45:11.073 --> 01:45:12.713]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[01:45:12.713 --> 01:45:14.214]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:20.597]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[01:45:20.597 --> 01:45:29.520]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:32.802]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[01:45:32.802 --> 01:45:34.963]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[01:45:34.963 --> 01:45:37.604]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[01:45:37.604 --> 01:45:40.425]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[01:45:40.805 --> 01:45:41.485]  What are champions made of?
[01:45:41.485 --> 01:45:42.625]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:46:10.313 --> 01:46:12.254]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[01:46:13.775 --> 01:46:15.096]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[01:46:45.271 --> 01:46:46.512]  That's InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:46:46.512 --> 01:46:47.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:12.233 --> 01:47:13.874]  Alright, I'm going to move quick through your calls.
[01:47:13.874 --> 01:47:15.996]  We get to a lot of people here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:19.379]  I'm going to Carlos in Texas, then John in Florida.
[01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:19.940]  Get ready.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:23.703]  Carlos, welcome!
[01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:24.083]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:24.083 --> 01:47:24.764]  I'm here.
[01:47:24.764 --> 01:47:27.506]  Yes, you are.
[01:47:27.506 --> 01:47:28.527]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:28.527 --> 01:47:31.850]  I wanted to say, awesome win for America.
[01:47:31.850 --> 01:47:35.934]  Hopefully, whenever we get a good judge on some of your cases,
[01:47:36.815 --> 01:47:40.697]  It's going to be the same exact thing as long as they're patriots.
[01:47:40.697 --> 01:47:48.342]  I mean, literally, the judge in Texas, even the Democrats say, is the worst judge they've ever seen on all her cases.
[01:47:48.342 --> 01:47:50.283]  A total judicial tyrant.
[01:47:50.283 --> 01:47:53.365]  Just a complete, just absolutely out of control.
[01:47:53.365 --> 01:47:59.408]  And I mean, she defaulted Owen Schroyer, who they've never deposed or subpoenaed and sent a letter.
[01:47:59.408 --> 01:48:03.731]  She certified that he didn't respond and that he is defaulted.
[01:48:03.731 --> 01:48:04.091]  Right there!
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.523]  I mean, that's how crazy, these people, they don't even respond to us.
[01:48:09.523 --> 01:48:12.445]  They don't even respond to us when we like, hey, we want to depose you.
[01:48:12.445 --> 01:48:14.566]  We don't even get a response.
[01:48:14.566 --> 01:48:19.169]  We just, we're told, you give us everything, and we do, and they go, you gave us nothing!
[01:48:19.169 --> 01:48:20.871]  It's a, it's okay.
[01:48:20.871 --> 01:48:23.392]  That's a civil, that's a civil issue.
[01:48:23.392 --> 01:48:25.113]  What we do is we force it all the way through.
[01:48:25.113 --> 01:48:26.975]  You understand, I don't get a jury trial, sir.
[01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:28.328]  I don't
[01:48:47.851 --> 01:48:49.373]  The kangaroo operation.
[01:48:49.373 --> 01:48:55.701]  I just have to go through the kangaroo operation, be on national TV, not be allowed to defend myself, to be demonized.
[01:48:55.701 --> 01:48:56.342]  That's okay.
[01:48:56.342 --> 01:48:57.183]  I don't care.
[01:48:57.183 --> 01:48:57.764]  I can handle it.
[01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:59.186]  It means nothing to me.
[01:48:59.186 --> 01:49:05.013]  What matters to me is staying on air and people spreading the word so we save the children and defeat the pedophile armies.
[01:49:05.013 --> 01:49:05.434]  You understand?
[01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:08.442]  Yes sir, I understand now.
[01:49:08.442 --> 01:49:09.923]  You've been on fire this week.
[01:49:09.923 --> 01:49:19.869]  This week, you reached so many people that were dumbed down, they had no clue, and now they see the truth has come out.
[01:49:19.869 --> 01:49:30.175]  I've had to explain in baby turns to people that this is a plan by Satan, set in forth in motion many years ago.
[01:49:30.175 --> 01:49:35.778]  And now, you waking up, thankfully you woke me up more than 10 years ago Alex.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:50:00.026]  I thank you for that, and I've been able to wake up lots of people, but you going to the forefront, being with Joe, being with Tim Pool, being with all these guys, all these heavy hitters that are making the difference, they're putting you, not necessarily on the map, you've been on the map, but your message is going mainstream.
[01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:04.607]  Everything that was once hidden, that you can only hear on InfoWars, you've said it plenty of times.
[01:50:05.559 --> 01:50:06.960]  I hear you, brother, and it's beautiful.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:07.781]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:07.781 --> 01:50:08.481]  We're going to move quick.
[01:50:08.481 --> 01:50:09.642]  A lot of great callers here.
[01:50:09.642 --> 01:50:10.903]  John in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:50:10.903 --> 01:50:12.904]  Welcome.
[01:50:12.904 --> 01:50:13.624]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:13.624 --> 01:50:15.846]  I just wanted to say God bless Mr. Rittenhouse.
[01:50:15.846 --> 01:50:19.548]  You know, I was, with it taking this long, I was expecting a hung jury.
[01:50:19.548 --> 01:50:22.030]  That way the prosecution would get a twofer.
[01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:24.371]  Everybody would still riot, and then they could charge him again.
[01:50:25.836 --> 01:50:28.638]  Mr. Whittenhouse, sadly, I don't believe is out of the woods yet.
[01:50:28.638 --> 01:50:33.962]  I think the feds are going to try some sort of civil rights violation against him, but hopefully he stands strong.
[01:50:33.962 --> 01:50:36.264]  I hope God is on his side.
[01:50:36.264 --> 01:50:44.110]  One of the main reasons I wanted to talk to you today, Alex, was the upcoming smallpox problem that's about to be unleashed.
[01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:55.318]  In 2018, and then again July of this year, 2021, the FDA approved two separate drugs, one in 2018 and one this year, for the treatment of smallpox.
[01:50:55.956 --> 01:51:01.359]  Why is the FDA doing treatment of smallpox drugs when smallpox has been eradicated since 1970?
[01:51:01.359 --> 01:51:04.722]  And suddenly, Bill Gates is connected to those drugs, at least one.
[01:51:04.722 --> 01:51:09.925]  He's out saying, we're going to be hit by smallpox, and now the FBI finds some in some lab in Philadelphia.
[01:51:09.925 --> 01:51:11.246]  Yeah, they're getting ready.
[01:51:11.246 --> 01:51:13.027]  They're pre-programming.
[01:51:13.027 --> 01:51:23.814]  Alex, there are some natural herbal remedies for that, and I wanted to call you and get your R&D team on some of that stuff, you know, and get out there to the people to really help people.
[01:51:24.875 --> 01:51:32.101]  Any treatments that they're going to be offering, they're not going to be giving it to anybody who's refused the COVID vaccine.
[01:51:32.101 --> 01:51:33.963]  So, this is all part of their plan.
[01:51:33.963 --> 01:51:37.165]  They're coming for us, they're coming to kill us, and they're not going to stop.
[01:51:37.165 --> 01:51:38.386]  It's just not going to stop.
[01:51:38.386 --> 01:51:45.392]  Our government is occupied by an exterminist, dehumanization, depopulation, death cult, beautifully said.
[01:51:45.392 --> 01:51:47.194]  And you're totally right, John, we should be saying,
[01:51:48.462 --> 01:51:50.282]  What happens to Rittenhouse next?
[01:51:50.282 --> 01:51:53.243]  A civil rights criminal charges?
[01:51:53.243 --> 01:51:54.963]  I know that the feds have talked about that.
[01:51:54.963 --> 01:51:56.164]  And you think, well that's outrageous.
[01:51:56.164 --> 01:51:57.944]  He was shown to be not guilty.
[01:51:57.944 --> 01:52:02.125]  That's how evil and out of control this Justice Department is.
[01:52:02.125 --> 01:52:04.285]  Or they may do a civil rights suit against him.
[01:52:04.285 --> 01:52:05.986]  Or private suits against him.
[01:52:05.986 --> 01:52:08.186]  You better believe they're going to keep coming after Rittenhouse.
[01:52:08.186 --> 01:52:11.827]  But this victory's so big, they might be smart enough to drop it.
[01:52:11.827 --> 01:52:12.427]  But who knows?
[01:52:12.427 --> 01:52:13.327]  Great point.
[01:52:13.327 --> 01:52:16.008]  And how bad will the riots be tonight with the National Guard and Kenosha?
[01:52:17.545 --> 01:52:20.528]  You know, honestly, I don't know.
[01:52:20.528 --> 01:52:27.834]  I hope they're calm and peaceful, and I hope we don't end up having another situation where somebody else has to defend themselves because of this.
[01:52:27.834 --> 01:52:29.835]  But, you know, I don't put anything past people.
[01:52:29.835 --> 01:52:35.340]  They're evil, sick bastards, and it's got to stop, and it's got to stop now.
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:36.200]  One quick point.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.082]  I want to make two here, Alex, before you let me go.
[01:52:38.082 --> 01:52:40.224]  I know you're trying to get to other callers.
[01:52:40.224 --> 01:52:43.046]  Here in America, we need what I like to call the Great Migration.
[01:52:44.032 --> 01:52:49.814]  We really, truly, truly need to have people leave these blue states and move to red states.
[01:52:49.814 --> 01:52:50.674]  It's got to happen.
[01:52:50.674 --> 01:52:52.895]  It's got to happen at warp speed.
[01:52:52.895 --> 01:52:54.736]  There is no saving the federal government.
[01:52:54.736 --> 01:52:55.956]  It is lost.
[01:52:55.956 --> 01:52:58.097]  It is completely understated.
[01:52:58.097 --> 01:53:06.439]  The only way to save this country is to have people move to red states where you can hold the line and then we declare independence from the federal government.
[01:53:06.439 --> 01:53:08.180]  That is the only way we are
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.983]  More and more I agree with you sir and I appreciate your call.
[01:53:10.983 --> 01:53:23.897]  We can have a huge epiphany and the military and police join us in solidarity and march on all the major capitals and say no and just stop complying and say Fauci cooked up the weapon, they released the virus, they need to all go to prison over and over again.
[01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:28.122]  That's why they've got Fauci and all them calling for us to be put in prison because they want to flip the script.
[01:53:28.482 --> 01:53:40.511]  So I don't agree with you, that's the only way, but I think it's the surest way is to migrate, occupy, take over governments legally and lawfully, and be all of us politically active, just super hyper, in the left's face, to win victories.
[01:53:40.511 --> 01:53:42.653]  When we stand up and take action, we win.
[01:53:42.653 --> 01:53:43.893]  When we don't, they take over.
[01:53:43.893 --> 01:53:48.777]  So, you're going to have to get political, you're going to have to take action, or we're all going to lose.
[01:53:48.777 --> 01:53:53.661]  That's why the General Flynn interview that's right at the top of Bandot Video and FreeWorldNews.tv is a
[01:53:55.556 --> 01:54:00.346]  45 minute blueprint of taking our government back and we all better get political now or lose everything.
[01:54:01.181 --> 01:54:07.003]  Global exclusive, General Flynn lays out plan to save America and the world.
[01:54:07.003 --> 01:54:08.944]  And yeah, okay, it's got a million, three hundred thousand views.

[01:54:10.064 --> 01:54:11.045]  Sounds like a lot.

[01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:13.726]  You want to save the country?
[01:54:13.726 --> 01:54:19.568]  I mean, it's just, we built it, it's there, yeah, it's great, we got one of the biggest independent sites out there.
[01:54:19.568 --> 01:54:23.330]  I don't care about being big myself or any of that crap.
[01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:25.991]  I care about defeating tyrants.
[01:54:25.991 --> 01:54:28.912]  And this is serious medicine for this country in that film.
[01:54:30.202 --> 01:54:33.144]  And it's all free, right there at band.video.

[01:57:17.191 --> 01:57:20.453]  I'm a mouth breather, because my nose has been broken so many times.
[01:57:20.453 --> 01:57:24.897]  I've got a deviated septum, and when I forget to have it by the bed, I don't have good sleep.
[01:57:24.897 --> 01:57:32.984]  About 3am, wake up, go take a piss, throat's sore, excuse my French, and just... Mmm, absolutely.
[01:57:32.984 --> 01:57:33.244]  And then,

[02:00:25.989 --> 02:00:27.275]  Alright, here's what's going on.
[02:00:28.331 --> 02:00:32.875]  We've got Mike Cernovich riding shotgun with us and he's a lawyer and has been all over the Rittenhouse case.
[02:00:32.875 --> 02:00:41.923]  He'll be riding shotgun taking your calls with me coming up for the next two hours here on this very exciting, amazing broadcast.
[02:00:41.923 --> 02:00:44.385]  But you know they're going to try to burn down Kenosha.
[02:00:44.385 --> 02:00:49.909]  You know the left's going to be out there, a bunch of mainly white pedophiles and I mean literal scum of the earth.
[02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:56.335]  It's like, oh this guy's a bank robber, this guy's a child molester, this guy beats his wife, this guy's a meth dealer, this guy's a child molester.
[02:00:57.830 --> 02:01:02.494]  It's like a pedophile army, and they're going to go crazy.
[02:01:02.494 --> 02:01:07.797]  It's going to be a bunch of white pedophiles running around screaming the N-word at people trying to defend their businesses.
[02:01:07.797 --> 02:01:10.900]  So we're going to have coverage of all that and your calls.
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:12.921]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:01:12.921 --> 02:01:16.784]  Let me see who's been holding the longest here.
[02:01:16.784 --> 02:01:19.306]  Let's go ahead and go to Carlos in Canada.
[02:01:19.306 --> 02:01:22.428]  Carlos, go ahead.
[02:01:22.428 --> 02:01:23.489]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:23.489 --> 02:01:27.192]  Just congratulations for justice having been rendered.
[02:01:27.908 --> 02:01:29.989]  It's hopeful.
[02:01:29.989 --> 02:01:35.471]  As a Canadian, I can tell you it gives me great joy to know that America works.
[02:01:35.471 --> 02:01:51.836]  There's a lot of threat to the Republic, and I want to just draw your attention to something which the Founding Fathers did not specifically put in the Constitution of the United States, and that is inherent in the name of
[02:01:52.472 --> 02:01:55.553]  The United States.
[02:01:55.553 --> 02:02:08.757]  If, at any one point, the Founding Fathers could have changed the name, could have called it Columbia, America, or whatever, America Vescuci, whatever they could have called it, but they called it and they left the name The United States.
[02:02:08.757 --> 02:02:20.101]  If there should ever be tyranny, if there should ever be a rogue president, or a rogue Congress, or a breakdown of the check and balances in your system, the
[02:02:20.723 --> 02:02:21.644]  Absolutely.
[02:02:21.644 --> 02:02:26.649]  They then break up and create new compacts or new governments if they see fit.
[02:02:26.649 --> 02:02:28.471]  That's in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:02:41.923 --> 02:02:42.804]  Exactly.
[02:02:42.804 --> 02:02:45.125]  And that is exactly the issue.
[02:02:45.125 --> 02:02:59.175]  Can you imagine some, you know, rogue usurper or even, you know, Joe the Ripper, you know, trying to do something along the lines of having the military against the civilians in a particular state?
[02:02:59.175 --> 02:03:02.978]  The governor can say, wait a second, no, no, no, it ain't working.
[02:03:02.978 --> 02:03:09.963]  All the governors of the states can in fact stand and protect their individual citizens.
[02:03:10.473 --> 02:03:15.978]  And they have a responsibility against tyranny or against foreign invasion, of course.
[02:03:15.978 --> 02:03:26.288]  And I just simply wanted to draw your attention that if it really came down to that, the United States could be divided states temporarily until the Republic was rebuilt.
[02:03:26.288 --> 02:03:26.849]  Absolutely.
[02:03:26.849 --> 02:03:28.991]  We can have the... That's what I was going to say in the last caller.
[02:03:28.991 --> 02:03:29.871]  We could have the states...
[02:03:30.754 --> 02:03:32.214]  Thank you, Alex, and just a minor comment tonight.
[02:03:32.214 --> 02:03:35.115]  President Trump still remains a viable American.
[02:03:35.115 --> 02:03:36.095]  He's done great things for America.
[02:04:00.794 --> 02:04:09.846]  Unfortunately, he didn't have enough political experience or a team behind him and he couldn't choose who to, you know, bring into.
[02:04:09.846 --> 02:04:17.917]  I remember very clearly having a shared conversation with yourself and an individual, I believe his name was Joe Bannister.
[02:04:18.985 --> 02:04:19.606]  Yes.
[02:04:19.606 --> 02:04:20.907]  He was the person.
[02:04:20.907 --> 02:04:28.335]  Yeah, he stood, and he questioned the IRS and the way that individuals are being taxed, and so on.
[02:04:28.335 --> 02:04:31.638]  They tried to put him in prison twice for his speech.
[02:04:31.638 --> 02:04:32.499]  Exactly.
[02:04:32.499 --> 02:04:40.648]  And, you know, I recently turned to, in desperation, because, well, I'm a Canadian, but we are close to you in every sense.
[02:04:41.676 --> 02:04:50.226]  And to see that President Trump, for instance, he doesn't even know who Georgie Schwartz is.
[02:04:50.226 --> 02:04:53.350]  Georgie Schwartz is George Soros.
[02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:55.092]  He's not even, that's not even... No, I hear you.
[02:04:55.092 --> 02:04:56.134]  Well, thanks for calling.
[02:04:57.307 --> 02:04:58.088]  Info Wars.
[02:05:14.801 --> 02:05:17.064]  Again, so many toxins in them.

[02:05:33.157 --> 02:05:41.819]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:41.819 --> 02:05:45.280]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.141]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[02:05:48.141 --> 02:05:57.703]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[02:06:07.754 --> 02:06:09.375]  More of your calls.
[02:06:09.375 --> 02:06:10.075]  Big Brother.
[02:06:10.075 --> 02:06:11.876]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:11.876 --> 02:06:13.757]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:13.757 --> 02:06:15.478]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:15.478 --> 02:06:17.118]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:17.118 --> 02:06:22.020]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:24.382]  More of your calls are coming up.
[02:06:24.382 --> 02:06:31.765]  Mike Cernovich is going to be in studio coming up this segment, but first, a report on AOC and her attack on the First Amendment.
[02:06:34.537 --> 02:06:39.858]  The democratic process under Nancy Pelosi has become that of a dictatorship.
[02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:40.698]  It's a cartoon.
[02:06:40.698 --> 02:06:42.259]  Relax, he said.
[02:06:42.259 --> 02:06:42.599]  Really?
[02:06:42.599 --> 02:06:44.199]  A cartoon?
[02:06:44.199 --> 02:06:45.279]  Relax?
[02:06:45.279 --> 02:06:52.301]  The Speaker of the House stopped Americans from petitioning their member of Congress to redress their grievances, wouldn't even let them in their own Capitol.
[02:06:52.301 --> 02:06:54.521]  And now here we go again, censoring speech.
[02:06:54.521 --> 02:07:00.963]  The most fundamental liberty we have is our right to speak, our right to talk, our right to communicate, and they're going after that today.
[02:07:02.022 --> 02:07:03.202]  Because they don't like freedom.
[02:07:03.202 --> 02:07:16.968]  For example, as the face of the January 6th Patriot trap, Jacob Chansley is sentenced to three years and five months in order to strengthen the Democrats' stranglehold on their politics of fear and victimization.
[02:07:17.148 --> 02:07:25.977]  Jacob Chansley, the self-proclaimed QAnon shaman, has just been sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the January 6th Capitol riots.
[02:07:25.977 --> 02:07:29.700]  He was seen entering the Senate chamber with a spear.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:38.549]  The House of Tyrants are now setting a new precedent, stripping their opposition of their committee assignments over hyper-criticism of an anime.
[02:07:38.769 --> 02:07:41.311]  This is not about me.
[02:07:41.311 --> 02:07:44.454]  This is not about Representative Gosar.
[02:07:44.454 --> 02:07:48.357]  But this is about what we are willing to accept.
[02:07:48.357 --> 02:07:56.644]  Last week my staff posted a video depicting a policy battle regarding amnesty for tens of millions of illegal aliens.
[02:07:56.644 --> 02:08:01.068]  This is an enemy that speaks to young voters who are too often overlooked.
[02:08:02.122 --> 02:08:10.089]  Even Twitter, the left's mouthpiece, did not remove the cartoon noting it was in the public interest for it to remain.
[02:08:10.089 --> 02:08:23.001]  Democrat policies are so pathetic and have done so poorly that the left has nothing else to do but troll the internet looking for ways to get offended and then try to target members and strip them of their committees.
[02:08:23.001 --> 02:08:27.104]  Now this nihilism runs deep
[02:08:28.737 --> 02:08:38.903]  And it conveys and betrays a certain contempt for the meaning and importance of our work here.
[02:08:38.903 --> 02:08:44.047]  These depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny,
[02:08:45.515 --> 02:08:48.856]  And racial misogyny, racist misogyny.
[02:08:48.856 --> 02:08:57.260]  Meanwhile, the Democrats ignore their own violent rhetoric that incited billions of property damage and at least two dozen deaths.
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:07.865]  In a move that almost perfectly embodies the absurdity of our current political moment, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came out in favor of the riot that Trace just described.
[02:09:07.865 --> 02:09:09.025]  Punch a cop!
[02:09:09.025 --> 02:09:10.286]  We are not safe.
[02:09:11.567 --> 02:09:23.318]  With people who hold positions of power, who are willing to endanger the lives of others if they think it will score them a political point.
[02:09:23.318 --> 02:09:24.099]  Bang!
[02:09:24.099 --> 02:09:24.839]  Bang!
[02:09:24.839 --> 02:09:25.580]  Bang!
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:30.304]  And then I just start to hear these yells of, where is she?
[02:09:31.852 --> 02:09:33.473]  Where is she?
[02:09:33.473 --> 02:09:37.635]  Now, she was claiming that they were banging on the door.
[02:09:37.635 --> 02:09:38.375]  Where is she?
[02:09:38.375 --> 02:09:39.076]  Where is she?
[02:09:39.076 --> 02:09:41.057]  They were screaming loudly in the halls.
[02:09:41.057 --> 02:09:44.899]  I would imagine if you were there at the time, did you see and hear that?
[02:09:45.356 --> 02:09:47.638]  We have to separate fact from fiction.
[02:09:47.638 --> 02:09:51.061]  And the facts are, there was no violent mob in the hallways.
[02:09:51.061 --> 02:09:55.544]  The folks who were there to riot weren't in the Cannon office building.
[02:09:55.544 --> 02:10:02.730]  And so we have to be very clear and not exaggerate this experience or take advantage of it and politicize it in any way, shape, or form.
[02:10:02.890 --> 02:10:08.055]  Arizona Republican Representative Paul Gosar posted this video to Twitter.
[02:10:08.055 --> 02:10:18.065]  The video depicts Gosar as the hero of the Attack on Titan anime, defeating the oppressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Biden.
[02:10:18.065 --> 02:10:23.290]  Leave it to the victimization mindset of the Democrats to wield tyranny in the form of censure,
[02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:32.820]  to further destroy freedom of expression and accelerate the characterization of the GOP as white supremacists and misogynists.
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:41.288]  If the Democrats truly had their way, they would imprison anyone and everyone they deem inferior to their lunacy.
[02:10:41.288 --> 02:10:42.490]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:10:46.758 --> 02:10:49.339]  Well, it's a historic time to be alive.
[02:10:49.339 --> 02:10:50.560]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:59.805]  Mike Cernovich is with us for the next hour and 45 minutes or so on air that we have left in the broadcast on this amazing Friday transmission.
[02:10:59.805 --> 02:11:01.265]  It's great to have Mike Cernovich here.
[02:11:01.265 --> 02:11:05.267]  It's great to have Tim Poole here yesterday as well.
[02:11:05.267 --> 02:11:07.468]  That is quite the transmission.
[02:11:07.468 --> 02:11:08.309]  It was wonderful to have a
[02:11:08.769 --> 02:11:13.371]  I'll be on the show with Joe Rogan just a few days ago, and people are really getting awake.
[02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:18.092]  I wanted to play the verdict again for everybody, and we'll do that coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:11:18.092 --> 02:11:20.233]  But what I really want to see is the prosecutor.
[02:11:20.233 --> 02:11:25.475]  And we're looking for any other footage, but it looks like there was one pool camera, and it was not on the prosecutor.
[02:11:25.475 --> 02:11:28.036]  But I would love to see the look on his face.
[02:11:28.036 --> 02:11:29.977]  But there's going to be repercussions from this.
[02:11:29.977 --> 02:11:32.958]  So what's your big takeaway from this, and what comes next?
[02:11:32.958 --> 02:11:36.099]  Mike Cernovich, who's also a lawyer, not just an award-winning filmmaker.
[02:11:36.963 --> 02:11:40.984]  Yeah, what's going to come next, and I'm telling people, is remain vigilant.
[02:11:40.984 --> 02:11:42.925]  They're going to need scapegoats.
[02:11:42.925 --> 02:11:45.526]  They're going to need new victims.
[02:11:45.526 --> 02:11:54.289]  Garland and the enemies of goodness, the enemy of the children, the evil people, the dark worshipers, the death worshipers, they want revenge.
[02:11:54.289 --> 02:11:58.851]  So, people are celebrating, and in my own mind, I'm thinking,
[02:11:59.631 --> 02:12:02.194]  Why are we celebrating he never should have been prosecuted?
[02:12:02.194 --> 02:12:04.397]  Why are we celebrating an underage boy was lynched?
[02:12:04.397 --> 02:12:10.043]  Why are we celebrating the corporate media, the Democrat establishment, Joe Biden himself defended a convicted pedophile?
[02:12:10.043 --> 02:12:12.586]  Let's just talk about what happened, okay?
[02:12:12.586 --> 02:12:15.570]  And why I'm not fucking celebrating, freaking celebrating, I'm sorry.
[02:12:15.570 --> 02:12:16.731]  I don't mean to cuss.
[02:12:16.731 --> 02:12:18.012]  Let's talk about what really happened.
[02:12:18.573 --> 02:12:22.636]  An underage boy was almost murdered by a serial pedophile.
[02:12:22.636 --> 02:12:26.178]  A serial child rapist almost murdered an underage boy.
[02:12:26.178 --> 02:12:36.084]  Everyone from Joe Biden to CNN to the Washington Post, the New York Times, the MSNBC defended a convicted pedophile and joined a lynch mob against a 17 year old boy.
[02:12:36.084 --> 02:12:37.305]  So I'm not celebrating.
[02:12:37.305 --> 02:12:39.146]  I'm not happy with what happened today.
[02:12:39.146 --> 02:12:40.327]  I feel contempt.
[02:12:41.047 --> 02:12:52.535]  Bile, indignation, rage, the disgust that I live in a filthy society where people are defending pedophiles, including Joe Biden.
[02:12:52.535 --> 02:12:56.378]  So what Kyle Rittenhouse went through was horrific.
[02:12:56.378 --> 02:12:57.299]  He was lynched.
[02:12:57.299 --> 02:13:02.042]  The only reason he wasn't convicted, we now know that prosecutors all lie, nothing happens.
[02:13:02.042 --> 02:13:03.544]  The only reason he wasn't convicted
[02:13:04.384 --> 02:13:10.147]  Is because a few streamers from Free Beacon, The Daily Caller, were there and they got that footage.
[02:13:10.147 --> 02:13:14.809]  Otherwise, there would be no footage clearly vindicating Carl Rittenhouse.
[02:13:14.809 --> 02:13:15.930]  He was almost lynched.
[02:13:15.930 --> 02:13:17.851]  This is the precipice that we're on.
[02:13:17.851 --> 02:13:24.794]  We're on the precipice of full-on communist revolution where they begin lynching people because they lynched him.
[02:13:25.194 --> 02:13:28.539]  They were stopped from lynching him because they were not powerful enough to do it.
[02:13:28.539 --> 02:13:29.901]  GoFundMe lynched him.
[02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:30.802]  Facebook lynched him.
[02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:36.850]  They banned anybody who spoke the truth, which anyone who watched the videos and seen would know to be true.
[02:13:36.850 --> 02:13:41.717]  We got debanked for the third time and they told us it was over supporting Rittenhouse and having his mom on.
[02:13:42.077 --> 02:13:43.238]  Yes, I'm furious.
[02:13:43.238 --> 02:13:44.018]  I'm not.
[02:13:44.018 --> 02:13:44.458]  Oh, wow.
[02:13:44.458 --> 02:13:45.018]  No, I hear you.
[02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:45.899]  We're vindicated.
[02:13:45.899 --> 02:13:46.719]  This was a fraud.
[02:13:46.719 --> 02:13:47.459]  It should never happen.
[02:13:47.459 --> 02:13:48.440]  You're right.
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:51.021]  I couldn't help have a dopamine rush, though, that he's not going to prison.
[02:13:51.021 --> 02:13:53.082]  Yeah, I feel good for him.
[02:13:53.082 --> 02:13:57.964]  But I'm outraged that I had to watch everyone from the commander in chief
[02:13:58.884 --> 02:14:10.318]  Of this country's military, to every corporate media outlet, to every left-wing pundit, to Facebook, to GoFundMe, to every social media outlet, defend a serial pedophile.
[02:14:10.318 --> 02:14:12.160]  It was about choosing a side.
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:17.166]  And like you said yesterday, they actually had a bunch of signs out showing him as a superhero and as a saint.
[02:14:17.626 --> 02:14:20.188]  Right, so I'm not, I'm not happy with what happened today.
[02:14:20.188 --> 02:14:22.629]  I don't feel good about what happened today.
[02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:31.235]  I look at it as the bullet whizzed right by his head, grazed him, he has a gashing wound, and they're still going to try to kill him.
[02:14:31.235 --> 02:14:42.503]  They're still, you think they're going to end this, but what I am grateful for, and I feel very selfish saying this, I feel selfish saying this, but I'm grateful that
[02:14:43.363 --> 02:14:47.145]  This was shown, the system was shown for what it was.
[02:14:47.145 --> 02:14:48.506]  That the system was evil.
[02:14:48.506 --> 02:14:49.707]  What they did to him was evil.
[02:14:49.707 --> 02:14:53.429]  It wasn't a reasonable minds could disagree.
[02:14:53.429 --> 02:14:56.951]  It wasn't maybe he was wrong, maybe he was right.
[02:14:56.951 --> 02:14:58.612]  It was a full lynch.
[02:14:59.557 --> 02:15:01.559]  That's right, the whole system ganged up on him.
[02:15:01.559 --> 02:15:09.125]  The courts, the media, the Democratic Party, the Justice Department, world leaders.
[02:15:09.125 --> 02:15:12.208]  But then I guess he did have one good, fair judge.
[02:15:12.208 --> 02:15:13.249]  Yeah, and a boomer.
[02:15:13.249 --> 02:15:13.909]  A 70-year-old boomer.
[02:15:13.909 --> 02:15:15.391]  So God bless the boomers today.
[02:15:15.391 --> 02:15:20.015]  I like to criticize the boomers a little bit, but that's the last of the Mohicans.
[02:15:20.015 --> 02:15:21.956]  What happens when Binger becomes a judge?
[02:15:22.737 --> 02:15:32.463]  This is what's happening, and I can tell you as a lawyer, all of the judges who truly believe in civil liberties, and truly believe in the Constitution and the American way, they're all getting old.
[02:15:32.463 --> 02:15:33.863]  They're all retiring.
[02:15:33.863 --> 02:15:36.125]  We're going to have a bunch of woke judges like A.D.A.
[02:15:36.125 --> 02:15:38.906]  Binger, because the pipeline to a judge is prosecutor to judge.
[02:15:38.906 --> 02:15:40.747]  I experienced that in my family court case.
[02:15:40.747 --> 02:15:49.572]  I had this judge that was great, and then she retired, and then all these new ones, literally finance pastoralists came in, and they like laugh at you, and literally just like cackle like witches.
[02:15:49.572 --> 02:15:50.253]  Right, so we're
[02:15:51.073 --> 02:15:57.418]  Two, three, four years away from Rittenhouse who would have been convicted by the judge.
[02:15:57.418 --> 02:15:58.819]  I know you're humble.
[02:15:58.819 --> 02:16:00.521]  I know you're like me.
[02:16:00.521 --> 02:16:13.371]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[02:16:13.371 --> 02:16:15.693]  And now as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[02:16:19.417 --> 02:16:20.378]  It begins to dawn.
[02:16:20.378 --> 02:16:26.762]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are, that you be more active than you've ever been.
[02:16:26.762 --> 02:16:28.983]  The tip of the spear is Vandock Millionaire.
[02:16:28.983 --> 02:16:33.166]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is M4Wars.com.
[02:16:33.166 --> 02:16:37.789]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[02:16:37.789 --> 02:16:41.331]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[02:16:42.632 --> 02:16:44.154]  That's SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:16:44.154 --> 02:16:55.408]  And continue to go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours clean energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[02:16:58.456 --> 02:17:05.922]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[02:17:05.922 --> 02:17:13.067]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening to the climate.
[02:17:13.806 --> 02:17:19.352]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[02:17:19.352 --> 02:17:22.115]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[02:17:22.115 --> 02:17:29.002]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[02:17:29.002 --> 02:17:31.044]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[02:17:31.044 --> 02:17:33.047]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[02:17:33.847 --> 02:17:40.412]  is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[02:17:40.412 --> 02:17:43.494]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[02:17:43.494 --> 02:17:47.136]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[02:17:47.136 --> 02:17:54.161]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[02:17:54.161 --> 02:17:55.922]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[02:18:04.617 --> 02:18:11.543]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[02:18:11.543 --> 02:18:17.548]  Then our God Satan will reward us with eternal life.
[02:18:17.548 --> 02:18:20.411]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[02:18:22.119 --> 02:18:23.461]  They must first play God.
[02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:29.912]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[02:18:29.912 --> 02:18:31.314]  And in a way, they're right.
[02:18:31.314 --> 02:18:34.459]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us...
[02:18:35.390 --> 02:18:37.352]  Destroy our children's futures.
[02:18:37.352 --> 02:18:39.033]  The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[02:18:39.033 --> 02:18:42.736]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[02:18:42.736 --> 02:18:43.617]  So I ask you now.
[02:18:43.617 --> 02:18:49.242]  Are you going to step up and expose the new world order even more?
[02:18:49.242 --> 02:18:52.064]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[02:18:52.845 --> 02:18:56.807]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[02:18:56.807 --> 02:18:59.048]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[02:18:59.048 --> 02:19:00.609]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[02:19:00.609 --> 02:19:03.511]  Why do they hate America so much?
[02:19:03.511 --> 02:19:10.935]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[02:19:10.935 --> 02:19:11.875]  It's very, very simple.
[02:19:11.875 --> 02:19:13.196]  For their world government,
[02:19:13.536 --> 02:19:18.299]  They're anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish.
[02:19:18.299 --> 02:19:24.523]  Freedom and liberty and due process, injustice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[02:19:24.523 --> 02:19:27.065]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[02:19:27.065 --> 02:19:30.047]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[02:19:30.047 --> 02:19:31.968]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[02:19:31.968 --> 02:19:34.990]  They started a fight with you.
[02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:43.436]  And they're not gonna back down, and they're not gonna go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[02:19:44.196 --> 02:19:49.840]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:20:00.267]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack that we have any chance of beating these people.
[02:20:00.267 --> 02:20:02.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:24.169]  You're born a-rushin' like a wooden man, too
[02:20:43.855 --> 02:20:51.640]  Well, if you're a TV viewer, we've got one of the women that says that the three men that were shot, two of them died, are heroes!
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:56.124]  And you were talking about this worship of pedophiles, Mike Stern was being at the heart of their whole operation.
[02:20:56.124 --> 02:20:58.305]  Let's put that kooky lady back up there.
[02:20:58.305 --> 02:21:02.688]  You were just talking about this before they even put the image up on the screen during the break about worshiping pedophiles.
[02:21:02.688 --> 02:21:03.329]  What's going on with this?
[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:13.666]  Yeah, they can no longer deny that the left worships pedophiles because they're defending someone who is a serial child rapist.
[02:21:13.666 --> 02:21:25.114]  No, everyone says, let's just talk about this, everyone says, it's driving me insane, well, Carl Rittenhouse shouldn't have been out there that night with an assault rifle or an AR-15 or whatever you want to call it.
[02:21:25.114 --> 02:21:29.357]  And my response to that is, well, should a convicted pedophile have been out there?
[02:21:30.402 --> 02:21:34.104]  Should a domestic abuser have been out there?
[02:21:34.104 --> 02:21:40.407]  The criminal records of the three men who attacked Rittenhouse are so long that I can't even keep track.
[02:21:40.407 --> 02:21:58.155]  So if you want to claim that Kyle Rittenhouse, who by the way was the victim, should not have been out there, then before when I thought the left could be saved, and that's why I made hoax to really, I still naively believed that we could save some Democrats and they still had some pureness to their heart and that we could find common ground.
[02:21:58.155 --> 02:21:59.896]  I don't share common ground with pedophile supporters.
[02:22:00.379 --> 02:22:04.364]  How has the left, it seems, gotten so much more radical?
[02:22:04.364 --> 02:22:05.425]  They're all over the news now.
[02:22:05.425 --> 02:22:06.506]  They're all over Twitter.
[02:22:06.506 --> 02:22:08.228]  Professors saying pedophilia is good.
[02:22:08.228 --> 02:22:10.010]  It's everywhere.
[02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:15.917]  And like de Blasio is defending them, saying they were good people.
[02:22:16.437 --> 02:22:18.798]  Yeah, they call them minor attracted persons now.
[02:22:18.798 --> 02:22:25.021]  There was a professor who she, she, he, they, whatever their pronouns they want to use.
[02:22:25.021 --> 02:22:27.342]  Whatever pronouns they want to use, I don't even care about that.
[02:22:27.342 --> 02:22:30.504]  I'm more concerned with the nefarious messaging.
[02:22:30.504 --> 02:22:32.025]  And I used to believe that
[02:22:32.865 --> 02:22:37.487]  We had common ground, but there's no common ground with pedophiles, right?
[02:22:37.487 --> 02:22:39.387]  You can't have common ground with them.
[02:22:39.387 --> 02:22:44.769]  So everyone who is saying, if somebody, for example, here's what an old school leftist would say.
[02:22:44.769 --> 02:22:48.891]  An old school leftist would say, Carl Rittenhouse should not have been out there that night.
[02:22:49.511 --> 02:22:55.099]  But that pedophile who attacked him should be in prison for life as a serial pedophile.
[02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:58.163]  So this shows that this country is broken down.
[02:22:58.163 --> 02:23:00.045]  No one wants to say that, right?
[02:23:00.045 --> 02:23:03.550]  Everybody wants to say that McCall Rittenhouse should not have been out.
[02:23:03.550 --> 02:23:03.971]  Why not?
[02:23:03.971 --> 02:23:05.192]  Why shouldn't he have been out there?
[02:23:05.192 --> 02:23:06.774]  Why should he have not been out there, first of all?
[02:23:07.415 --> 02:23:13.239]  But even accepting that is true, why should a, why did this, that Gabe guy have a firearm?
[02:23:13.239 --> 02:23:15.340]  Was he an authorized user of a firearm?
[02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:20.344]  Was he allowed to legally own a firearm and to brandish a firearm and to point a firearm at a 17-year-old?
[02:23:20.344 --> 02:23:30.951]  What about how the FBI had overhead flare footage and ground footage knowing that Rittenhouse was getting shot at and they suppressed that and then MSNBC again wouldn't show any of the defense, only show the prosecution.
[02:23:30.951 --> 02:23:35.634]  Like you said, this is a high-tech lynching of the power structure defending mobs.
[02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:46.938]  And the beauty of it, and again, we often find beauty in tragedy, and what had happened to Rittenhouse, who's going to have a lot of trauma, is he's going to really struggle with this.
[02:23:46.938 --> 02:23:54.701]  Imagine that you were thrust into a combat situation, and the way that he was, and the healing that he's going to have to go through, and deal with that process.
[02:23:55.521 --> 02:24:03.103]  The beauty of this tragedy was that you can no longer claim, oh, we're in it together, right?
[02:24:03.103 --> 02:24:16.068]  My big criticism of Trump is that he's kind of a wimp, that he's a fraud, and he didn't have the character to do what needed to be done and purge the FBI of the evil, to purge the generals, the woke, weak generals, the General Milley's.
[02:24:16.068 --> 02:24:18.188]  I just think Trump didn't realize how corrupt it was.
[02:24:18.188 --> 02:24:19.009]  He said that.
[02:24:19.009 --> 02:24:22.770]  I'm not trying to overly defend Trump, but he was a lot better than what we got now.
[02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:31.874]  The people now coming up, though, realize that even McCarthy, who I don't think should be Speaker, McCarthy was going off on these people.
[02:24:31.874 --> 02:24:33.035]  There's moral clarity, right?
[02:24:33.035 --> 02:24:40.778]  That's what I tell people when I counsel people and help them through their own processes and thought processes.
[02:24:40.778 --> 02:24:45.581]  I always say one benefit of trauma is moral clarity.
[02:24:45.581 --> 02:24:47.441]  And moral clarity is beautiful.
[02:24:47.441 --> 02:24:49.002]  It's wrong to feel betrayed.
[02:24:49.002 --> 02:24:50.023]  It's wrong to have
[02:24:50.803 --> 02:24:53.704]  Unfocused mind, unfocused emotions.
[02:24:53.704 --> 02:24:55.605]  And we now have moral clarity.
[02:24:55.605 --> 02:24:56.865]  It's good versus evil.
[02:24:56.865 --> 02:25:01.967]  This is not... We have Mayor Bill de Blasio saying that this isn't over.
[02:25:01.967 --> 02:25:04.668]  He wants to incite violence against Rittenhouse.
[02:25:04.668 --> 02:25:08.409]  He's tweeting out an open call for violence, right?
[02:25:08.409 --> 02:25:14.951]  He's making open calls for violence, open incitements of violence from, again, a New York mayor.
[02:25:14.951 --> 02:25:17.992]  And by the way, if people are looking at that subway footage, I would like to
[02:25:18.652 --> 02:25:22.176]  Pigeonhole that to something that comes up where a lot of people get angry at me.
[02:25:22.176 --> 02:25:27.162]  In New York, there's footages, and this happened in Philadelphia too, where women are getting beat up.
[02:25:27.162 --> 02:25:27.362]  A lot.
[02:25:27.362 --> 02:25:28.083]  In New York.
[02:25:28.083 --> 02:25:34.810]  And then conservative men go, well if I were there, I'm a manly man, and if I were there, if you were there, okay, you'd end up like Rittenhouse.
[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:36.332]  To defend a liberal.
[02:25:36.332 --> 02:25:36.612]  Smart.
[02:25:37.193 --> 02:25:37.713]  Smart.
[02:25:37.713 --> 02:25:44.116]  Bill de Blasio saying that if you intervene on a bus in New York, you're going to get lynched like Rittenhouse.
[02:25:44.116 --> 02:25:46.196]  Great job, manly man conservative.
[02:25:46.196 --> 02:25:52.639]  When are these people going to wake up and get rid of this white knight cuck mindset where they don't realize
[02:25:54.119 --> 02:25:57.722]  90% chance of the people hurting each other voted for it.
[02:25:57.722 --> 02:26:09.429]  But you're, I'm a manly man, conservative, and I'm going to go in there, and you end up like Kyle Rittenhouse, because you're in New York now, you have a New York judge, you have a New York jury, and good luck raising $250,000 for your criminal offense.
[02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:10.830]  All for what?
[02:26:10.830 --> 02:26:11.370]  For what?
[02:26:11.370 --> 02:26:12.311]  That's another question.
[02:26:12.311 --> 02:26:18.775]  I want to play the verdict and also take some calls, get your take on what they have to say here with Mike Cernovich on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:20.154 --> 02:26:23.496]  How long can New York and places like that not totally collapse?
[02:26:23.496 --> 02:26:30.221]  I mean, like Los Angeles, because it's just the insanity is a feedback loop, and they're getting crazier and crazier.
[02:26:30.221 --> 02:26:32.402]  Yeah, the answer to that is none of our business.
[02:26:32.402 --> 02:26:44.710]  The answer to that is if you're a God-fearing Christian, if you're a conservative, what they want to do, if they want to live in filth, if they want to know that if you get on the subway, you might get beat up, you might get mugged, you might get killed.
[02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:45.871]  That's none of our business.
[02:26:45.871 --> 02:26:48.993]  It's not my business what happens in San Francisco, New York, LA.
[02:26:48.993 --> 02:26:49.894]  I don't go there anymore.
[02:26:50.374 --> 02:26:50.874]  Right?
[02:26:50.874 --> 02:27:04.660]  Occasionally I have to drive through LA to get somewhere, and I know that I'm on high alert, that at any moment, you're in a war zone, and at any moment, I was, for example, went to a wedding, my wife and I are driving down the highway, we hear gunshots.
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:05.920]  It literally is a war zone.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:09.962]  It's not a hyperbolic statement to call it a war zone.
[02:27:09.962 --> 02:27:12.583]  So me- Austin's a war zone in many areas now.
[02:27:13.411 --> 02:27:17.916]  And that's, hopefully you guys can handle that because you were here before they came here.
[02:27:17.916 --> 02:27:22.381]  So, in my view, you have, there's a moral obligation to do something here.
[02:27:22.381 --> 02:27:29.769]  And it's true, like, I don't, they're black, they're white, they're Hispanic, but it's like a zombie class is just boiling out everywhere.
[02:27:29.769 --> 02:27:30.930]  And, and, and, and what?
[02:27:30.930 --> 02:27:32.532]  Mostly, that's the thing about the racial thing.
[02:27:32.532 --> 02:27:35.175]  I was about to say, well, what did it, what did it, what happened to these people?
[02:27:35.995 --> 02:27:40.298]  That's what frustrates me is when people go, oh you're making a dog for race for LA?
[02:27:40.298 --> 02:27:43.139]  They're all white!
[02:27:43.139 --> 02:27:45.181]  They're junkies, they're all white homeless junkies.
[02:27:45.181 --> 02:27:47.942]  So I guess it's letting China ship in the fentanyl.
[02:27:47.942 --> 02:27:50.784]  Previously we had massive fentanyl, now it's doubled under Biden.
[02:27:50.784 --> 02:27:51.985]  That's all the numbers today.
[02:27:51.985 --> 02:27:54.166]  Doubling of the previous fentanyl overdoses.
[02:27:54.446 --> 02:27:54.766]  I saw 100,000.
[02:27:54.766 --> 02:28:01.351]  It's the first time that there's been 100,000 overdose deaths in history, is what I saw.
[02:28:01.351 --> 02:28:05.754]  And the numbers are so huge that I have to triple check it and make sure that it's reliable.
[02:28:05.754 --> 02:28:07.475]  Over 100,000 people dying.
[02:28:07.475 --> 02:28:13.559]  So my answer to that is, if you are a conservative, if you believe in goodness, if you don't take the side of people who defend Paddle Falls,
[02:28:14.059 --> 02:28:16.860]  Whatever happens in New York, mind your own business.
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:25.945]  If you're there because you have work or you're a tourist, and there's something happened on a train, you're going to intervene when Mayor DeBille de Blasio comes out in favor of lynching underage people?
[02:28:25.945 --> 02:28:27.345]  Get it together, conservatives!
[02:28:27.345 --> 02:28:27.785]  Quit!
[02:28:27.785 --> 02:28:35.309]  Get this crap out of your mind, where you have Captain Save-a-Rotten Society Complex for the people who hate you.
[02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:41.392]  You need to side and defend and support the people who are on your side, and if they want- But you're not blaming Rittenhouse for going to defend his dad.
[02:28:42.032 --> 02:28:46.735]  I'm not blaming him, but if he were my son, I would say, get your dad over here.
[02:28:46.735 --> 02:28:49.156]  If he were my son, you know what I would have told him?
[02:28:49.156 --> 02:28:52.658]  I would say, we live in a rotten, corrupt society.
[02:28:52.658 --> 02:28:56.281]  You need to just get your mind... Hold on, hold on, we're going to break, we're going to break.
[02:28:56.281 --> 02:29:04.665]  If you're concerned about the... There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[02:29:04.665 --> 02:29:06.647]  And look, almost all of them work.
[02:29:07.307 --> 02:29:10.589]  But they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[02:29:10.589 --> 02:29:15.832]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins in them.
[02:29:15.832 --> 02:29:27.918]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfolwarestore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[02:29:27.918 --> 02:29:30.900]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[02:29:31.912 --> 02:29:40.577]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock and in FortWorthStore.com.
[02:29:40.577 --> 02:29:44.039]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[02:29:44.039 --> 02:29:46.900]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:51.123]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[02:29:52.844 --> 02:30:10.545]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalists on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[02:30:11.205 --> 02:30:18.992]  For the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private, corporate, fascist world government.
[02:30:18.992 --> 02:30:26.218]  That's why they launched their Great Reset, and their program after collapsing us, of Build Back Better.
[02:30:26.218 --> 02:30:32.063]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[02:30:32.063 --> 02:30:35.606]  And because they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left
[02:30:36.446 --> 02:30:38.207]  I know you're humble.
[02:30:38.207 --> 02:30:40.027]  I know you're like me.
[02:30:40.027 --> 02:30:43.309]  But I really want you to sit back and kajijay, or meditate,
[02:31:05.686 --> 02:31:13.250]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:26.678]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[02:31:26.678 --> 02:31:28.899]  The tip of the spear is Band.Billion.
[02:31:28.899 --> 02:31:32.021]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.
[02:31:33.047 --> 02:31:37.688]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:42.530]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:44.070]  That's SaveM4Wars.com.
[02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:55.314]  And continue to go to M4WarsStore.com, where right now, we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours of energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[02:31:57.125 --> 02:32:00.667]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[02:32:00.667 --> 02:32:15.397]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany, these tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[02:32:15.397 --> 02:32:23.662]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[02:32:23.962 --> 02:32:25.784]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[02:32:25.784 --> 02:32:33.590]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:36.933]  government military grade, at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:32:36.933 --> 02:32:42.718]  We have the entire line of Silent Pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[02:32:42.718 --> 02:32:49.844]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[02:32:49.844 --> 02:32:50.585]  It's all there.
[02:32:51.005 --> 02:32:52.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:52.585 --> 02:32:53.406]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:53.406 --> 02:32:55.826]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:33:28.424 --> 02:33:31.247]  Yes sir, that looks good.
[02:33:31.247 --> 02:33:35.830]  You know, I rarely smoke cigars, but I know Mike Cernovich has always got nice ones.
[02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:53.786]  We tried to meet in Phoenix and smoke one back during the very first days of the contested election, and we had a leftist start a fight with us, and one of Cernovich's friends, who was a professional boxer, so it was a quite famous one actually, and we also had one of my
[02:33:54.626 --> 02:34:10.131]  A UFC former champion was one of my bodyguards, and this leftist looked like a big, giant, fat version of Rosenbaum, seriously, kept starting fights, and then the people that I guess owned the place were like, yeah, maybe you should leave.
[02:34:10.131 --> 02:34:11.492]  They kind of agreed with it.
[02:34:11.492 --> 02:34:12.572]  And that goes to what you're saying.
[02:34:12.572 --> 02:34:12.792]  Good.
[02:34:13.152 --> 02:34:22.779]  Put a sign up saying you like pedophilia, put a sign up saying you like world government, put a sign up saying you like open borders, put a sign up you're against self-defense, so we won't come in your stinking store.
[02:34:22.779 --> 02:34:28.963]  Instead, the left won't do that, but they're always trying to suppress us and debank us and deplatform us, and I'm sick of these bullies.
[02:34:29.775 --> 02:34:32.376]  Yeah, so I was gonna talk about that.
[02:34:32.376 --> 02:34:33.396]  We're bringing a couple cigars.
[02:34:33.396 --> 02:34:34.897]  We got there.
[02:34:34.897 --> 02:34:36.098]  Everybody was excited.
[02:34:36.098 --> 02:34:37.238]  We're sitting down to hang out.
[02:34:37.238 --> 02:34:40.579]  There was this meathead and I don't, he was like a big meatball.
[02:34:40.579 --> 02:34:45.301]  He's one of those guys who did too much trend but didn't ever diet.
[02:34:45.301 --> 02:34:48.582]  So he's a big blockhead meathead who thinks he plays in the NFL.
[02:34:48.582 --> 02:34:49.683]  He even had that big fat
[02:34:50.083 --> 02:34:51.704]  Neck roll on his head.
[02:34:51.704 --> 02:34:58.507]  And right when I was in there, I said, this guy's going to be trouble because he was sitting there in the back and I could tell he was a very angry person.
[02:34:58.507 --> 02:35:01.428]  And as we're sitting there, he looked like a giant version of Rosenbaum.
[02:35:01.428 --> 02:35:04.349]  He was a meatball, looked like a meatball, but he went to the gym.
[02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:05.510]  So he had that.
[02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:06.490]  I can barely move around.
[02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:07.330]  I'm such a big guy.
[02:35:07.330 --> 02:35:09.451]  No, you just don't like to.
[02:35:09.451 --> 02:35:10.812]  You like to eat too much, right?
[02:35:10.812 --> 02:35:11.172]  Meatball.
[02:35:13.513 --> 02:35:18.017]  I knew that there was going to be a bad vibe, so I sit there and I look and he's back in the corner like this.
[02:35:18.017 --> 02:35:20.318]  You know, like a demon.
[02:35:20.318 --> 02:35:21.019]  Yeah.
[02:35:21.019 --> 02:35:22.700]  And then we're just talking normally.
[02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:28.104]  He goes, meatball goes, I pay more of the taxes than anybody in here.
[02:35:29.165 --> 02:35:32.087]  And Alex turns and he's like, OK man, you know, that's cool.
[02:35:32.087 --> 02:35:33.949]  We're all just be cool, man.
[02:35:33.949 --> 02:35:36.650]  He goes, well, I pay more taxes than anyone in here.
[02:35:36.650 --> 02:35:38.051]  And OK, man, be cool.
[02:35:38.051 --> 02:35:38.472]  Be cool.
[02:35:38.472 --> 02:35:38.732]  Right.
[02:35:38.732 --> 02:35:39.432]  We don't care.
[02:35:39.432 --> 02:35:40.233]  Good for you.
[02:35:40.233 --> 02:35:40.473]  Right.
[02:35:40.473 --> 02:35:41.454]  I said, congratulations.
[02:35:41.454 --> 02:35:42.995]  I'm glad you're successful.
[02:35:42.995 --> 02:35:45.036]  Completely about deescalating the situation.
[02:35:45.036 --> 02:35:47.198]  What's crazy is we've got a bunch of killers with us.
[02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:48.639]  This guy's an idiot.
[02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:51.781]  Well, that's why I de-escalate because I don't want to end up like Rittenhouse.
[02:35:51.781 --> 02:35:54.023]  I know what would have happened to this guy.
[02:35:54.023 --> 02:35:56.886]  And in my own mind, I always move to de-escalation.
[02:35:56.886 --> 02:36:08.074]  What I always tell people is that you should never be rude to people in real life, but you should be able to handle business if it arises.
[02:36:08.074 --> 02:36:14.419]  The meatball then gets up and you hear all these chairs moving around like showdown at the OK Corral.
[02:36:15.490 --> 02:36:18.754]  Our guys are standing up and I'm thinking we gotta get out of here, man, because...
[02:36:19.952 --> 02:36:22.334]  Meatball is completely unstable.
[02:36:22.334 --> 02:36:24.395]  Meatball's about to get hurt really badly.
[02:36:24.395 --> 02:36:26.937]  And then we'll get framed, of course, because that's what happens.
[02:36:26.937 --> 02:36:28.157]  They frame us.
[02:36:28.157 --> 02:36:29.858]  So we're just sitting there trying to have a cigar.
[02:36:29.858 --> 02:36:31.740]  You're about to order dinner.
[02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:34.021]  We're here with the great Amanda Milius.
[02:36:34.021 --> 02:36:36.623]  She had made the Plot Against the President movie.
[02:36:36.623 --> 02:36:37.623]  So we're all there.
[02:36:37.623 --> 02:36:38.344]  Good vibes.
[02:36:38.344 --> 02:36:39.945]  Everybody's chill.
[02:36:39.945 --> 02:36:44.748]  But I know in the back of my head, this Meatball guy is the aggressor.
[02:36:44.748 --> 02:36:47.470]  Legally, we would be in the right.
[02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:48.991]  But we're going to get framed for this anyway.
[02:36:49.591 --> 02:36:52.997]  And then the owner said, well, maybe you people should just close out your tab.
[02:36:52.997 --> 02:36:54.239]  And he kept starting fights.
[02:36:54.239 --> 02:36:57.324]  He kept hitting on our face, threatening to kick our ass over and over.
[02:36:57.324 --> 02:36:59.087]  And I'm like, sir, it's OK.
[02:36:59.087 --> 02:37:00.810]  And he just kept like a demon laughing.
[02:37:02.165 --> 02:37:03.186]  I don't know.
[02:37:24.203 --> 02:37:25.684]  You have no idea!
[02:37:25.684 --> 02:37:48.303]  There's five people here that on their worst day... I mean we had armed security people being very nice and then one of the security guys, he's actually friends with Joe Rogan, he's a famous UFC guy, he's also on the police department in Phoenix, he wanted to come out and be with security and then there was a well-known former professional boxer that was a fan that was there who he kept starting a fight with that guy and it's like with a heavyweight boxer and I'm just like this dude's crazy!
[02:37:48.303 --> 02:37:49.985]  He couldn't have found a meaner group to mess with.
[02:37:50.245 --> 02:37:52.487]  I know, but we're the most friendly people in the world.
[02:37:52.487 --> 02:37:59.093]  We have to be wise like serpents, gentle like doves, and that's my... I always say... What do you think his goal was?
[02:37:59.093 --> 02:38:00.594]  His goal... To get his ass beat?
[02:38:00.594 --> 02:38:07.661]  Well, he was an angry human being, and he wanted to find an outlet for his rage, and in his own mind, he thinks...
[02:38:08.121 --> 02:38:09.042]  I think so.
[02:38:24.031 --> 02:38:45.570]  If I'm saying this, that tells you how whack the guy was, where they never really did any real sports, they never did anything athletic, they get a little bit of muscle mass on them, and then in some case they become meatballs because they keep eating because they read on a power lifting message board that having a 50 inch gut helps with them have a better squat, leverages on squats, and then they think that they're a threat, right?
[02:38:45.570 --> 02:38:46.872]  And they don't realize that
[02:38:48.278 --> 02:38:51.220]  You know, meatball would be gassed in eight seconds on the ground.
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:53.842]  But isn't that an example of the left in general?
[02:38:53.842 --> 02:38:55.183]  Like, they've already got control.
[02:38:55.183 --> 02:38:59.605]  Why are they pushing and messing with us and starting fights and bullying constantly?
[02:38:59.605 --> 02:39:01.187]  There he is.
[02:39:01.187 --> 02:39:04.429]  Well, it's because the leftist aesthetic is always nihilistic.
[02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:08.131]  The left doesn't have a theory of aesthetics.
[02:39:08.131 --> 02:39:10.052]  They don't have a theory of beauty.
[02:39:10.052 --> 02:39:17.277]  And what I've learned is that all politics are now aesthetic, where you could look now and say, okay, those people, that's a leftist.
[02:39:17.757 --> 02:39:19.698]  That person is a right-wing person.
[02:39:19.698 --> 02:39:20.599]  That person's left-wing.
[02:39:20.599 --> 02:39:31.585]  Well, it is true that black right-wingers, white right-wingers, Hispanic right-wingers look handsome and healthy, and then the left look like ghouls.
[02:39:32.332 --> 02:39:33.873]  Well, aesthetics.
[02:39:33.873 --> 02:39:41.159]  That's the whole point, is the left is fundamentally caught up in post-structuralism, deconstructionalism, nihilism.
[02:39:41.159 --> 02:39:42.580]  They don't have a theory of aesthetics.
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:45.322]  Everything is about tearing down what is beautiful.
[02:39:45.322 --> 02:39:45.522]  It is.
[02:39:45.522 --> 02:39:45.942]  It is.
[02:39:45.942 --> 02:39:51.666]  So because of that, they can't stop tearing things down, even when they're tearing down their own structures.
[02:39:51.666 --> 02:39:59.032]  So what the left has done is they've inadvertently deconstructed their own corporate media artifice through all of the lies.
[02:39:59.412 --> 02:39:59.793]  Yes, excellent.
[02:40:17.831 --> 02:40:20.892]  That's a composite of true stories.
[02:40:20.892 --> 02:40:23.053]  Oh yeah, 100% true story.
[02:40:23.053 --> 02:40:27.254]  It talks about East Germany and how they would spy on you, the Stasi.
[02:40:27.254 --> 02:40:36.957]  Actually if I made another movie I'd call it American Stasi and I would talk about how they murdered Vicky Weaver and then tortured her and mutilated the body and go through all the...
[02:40:38.146 --> 02:40:38.426]  Yeah.
[02:40:38.426 --> 02:40:38.506]  Yeah.
[02:41:08.416 --> 02:41:14.160]  And trapped him and then propped him up as some kind of trophy.
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:16.762]  And now they're trying that with right-wingers in January 6th.
[02:41:16.762 --> 02:41:18.003]  We're going to go to break and come back with calls.
[02:41:18.003 --> 02:41:19.124]  Appreciate folks holding.
[02:41:19.124 --> 02:41:22.887]  Mike Cernovich is wound up and on fire today.
[02:41:22.887 --> 02:41:24.048]  But don't be too bummed out.
[02:41:24.048 --> 02:41:25.289]  I mean, at least you're right.
[02:41:25.289 --> 02:41:26.610]  Rittenhouse shouldn't have been charged.
[02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:27.591]  It's wrong.
[02:41:27.591 --> 02:41:30.993]  But can't you find a silver lining in this club?
[02:41:30.993 --> 02:41:32.534]  I won't say what I really feel right now.
[02:41:32.534 --> 02:41:33.575]  I'm too angry.
[02:41:33.575 --> 02:41:34.356]  I regret what I say.
[02:41:36.007 --> 02:41:37.869]  Hypothetically, what would you say?
[02:41:37.869 --> 02:41:38.670]  Nothing.
[02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:41.274]  I'm not trying to get you in trouble, but... In a video game.
[02:41:41.274 --> 02:41:44.878]  In a video game, here's what I would say.
[02:41:44.878 --> 02:41:50.085]  In a video game, what would you say?
[02:41:50.085 --> 02:41:51.527]  Smoking toad venom on air, folks.
[02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:55.505]  DMT, DMT Lace Cigar.
[02:41:55.505 --> 02:41:57.066]  No, it's got Fentanyl.
[02:41:57.066 --> 02:41:58.407]  Fentanyl, I bought these from the homeless people.
[02:41:58.407 --> 02:41:59.068]  We're all gonna die.
[02:41:59.068 --> 02:42:00.329]  I bought these from the homeless people.
[02:42:00.329 --> 02:42:03.411]  I actually thought about that where... No, in a video game.
[02:42:03.411 --> 02:42:10.877]  People try to give me cigars, and I always think, like I appreciate the gesture, but how do I know there's not like Fentanyl laced in a cigar, because that's how they would assassinate.
[02:42:10.877 --> 02:42:12.999]  That's how you have to think at our level.
[02:42:12.999 --> 02:42:17.683]  Is, how would you, if you were them, how would you assassinate yourself?
[02:42:17.683 --> 02:42:22.547]  Well we know, they come to your house, they shoot you and your wife and your children, and they leave a suicide note that you did it.
[02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:26.637]  Yeah, but we have their measures.
[02:42:26.637 --> 02:42:29.643]  I'm going to lock mine when we come back.
[02:42:29.643 --> 02:42:31.347]  And I promise to run right to your calls, folks.
[02:42:33.686 --> 02:42:38.291]  Jacob and Robert and everybody else that's holding, we're going to go to you on the other side.
[02:42:38.291 --> 02:42:42.877]  We've got a whole other hour coming up with Mike Cernovich, and I'm going to replay the verdict here on air.
[02:42:42.877 --> 02:42:48.463]  But hey, Kyle Rittenhouse is feeling a lot better, but now he's going to be a hunted man the rest of his life.
[02:42:48.463 --> 02:42:50.685]  Thank God he's got the Second Amendment.
[02:42:50.685 --> 02:42:51.907]  We'll be right back.

[02:45:03.005 --> 02:45:03.845]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:45:03.845 --> 02:45:05.146]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:45:05.146 --> 02:45:05.707]  Good, Rob.
[02:45:05.707 --> 02:45:06.807]  Great last caller.
[02:45:06.807 --> 02:45:09.869]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:45:09.869 --> 02:45:15.573]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization and absurdity.
[02:45:15.573 --> 02:45:17.354]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[02:45:17.714 --> 02:45:19.356]  Alright, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:45:19.356 --> 02:45:20.297]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:45:20.297 --> 02:45:20.658]  Go ahead.
[02:45:20.658 --> 02:45:22.220]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:45:22.220 --> 02:45:25.243]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[02:45:25.243 --> 02:45:26.905]  The X-Tune does wonders.
[02:45:26.905 --> 02:45:28.047]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:45:28.047 --> 02:45:29.228]  You're on the fence about it.
[02:45:29.228 --> 02:45:30.049]  Get off the fence.
[02:45:30.049 --> 02:45:30.910]  Get the product.
[02:45:30.910 --> 02:45:32.132]  Support the info war.
[02:45:32.132 --> 02:45:33.413]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:45:33.413 --> 02:45:34.054]  You're on the air.
[02:45:34.054 --> 02:45:34.635]  Thanks for calling.
[02:45:34.635 --> 02:45:34.975]  Go ahead.
[02:45:34.975 --> 02:45:36.757]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[02:45:36.757 --> 02:45:37.258]  It's an honor.
[02:45:37.418 --> 02:45:38.258]  Honored to talk to you.
[02:45:38.258 --> 02:45:39.399]  Awesome.
[02:45:39.399 --> 02:45:44.822]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:45:44.822 --> 02:45:48.924]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[02:45:48.924 --> 02:45:50.704]  So, just number one for a few weeks.
[02:45:50.704 --> 02:45:51.565]  It definitely works.
[02:45:51.565 --> 02:45:53.186]  It's not a joke.
[02:45:53.186 --> 02:45:58.508]  Absolutely.
[02:45:58.508 --> 02:45:59.929]  I know you're humble.
[02:45:59.929 --> 02:46:01.610]  I know you're like me.
[02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:05.732]  But I really want you to sit back and conjugate, or meditate,
[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:14.444]  On the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[02:46:14.444 --> 02:46:27.870]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022 begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[02:46:27.870 --> 02:46:30.091]  The tip of the spear is Band.Billion.
[02:46:30.091 --> 02:46:33.393]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.
[02:46:34.261 --> 02:46:38.883]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[02:46:38.883 --> 02:46:43.726]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[02:46:43.726 --> 02:46:45.266]  That's SaveM4Wars.com.
[02:46:45.266 --> 02:46:56.532]  And continue to go to M4WarsStore.com, where right now, we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours of energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[02:47:00.004 --> 02:47:02.629]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:22.290 --> 02:47:27.814]  All right, Mike Cernovich is here with us, and I'm trying to convince him to be happy about this verdict.
[02:47:27.814 --> 02:47:29.175]  But I get his point.
[02:47:29.175 --> 02:47:34.979]  We shouldn't be here when they already had all the video footage and the witnesses that a bunch of people are out running around burning things down.
[02:47:34.979 --> 02:47:35.679]  They attack him.
[02:47:35.679 --> 02:47:36.239]  They're beating him.
[02:47:36.239 --> 02:47:37.860]  They're saying, we're going to kill you.
[02:47:37.860 --> 02:47:39.241]  They're shooting at him.
[02:47:39.241 --> 02:47:41.963]  And then the whole media acts like something else happened.
[02:47:41.963 --> 02:47:43.504]  That is really dangerous.
[02:47:43.504 --> 02:47:44.405]  So you're right.
[02:47:44.405 --> 02:47:46.606]  It's kind of like getting mauled by a bear.
[02:47:46.606 --> 02:47:51.530]  You're like, wow, you know, I got cuts all over me and my guts are hanging out, but I'm alive.
[02:47:51.530 --> 02:47:52.030]  But I guess
[02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:55.051]  There's two ways to see this.
[02:47:55.051 --> 02:48:00.914]  I think I'm more fired up, and energetically I think a lot of people are fired up, in a good way.
[02:48:00.914 --> 02:48:04.256]  Because we realize now, they're coming for everybody.
[02:48:04.256 --> 02:48:13.601]  And if this isn't going to be like the Bolshevik Revolution, where there was people thinking you could sit on the sidelines and the Bolsheviks are going to leave you alone.
[02:48:13.601 --> 02:48:14.921]  They're going to murder the kulaks!
[02:48:14.921 --> 02:48:16.022]  We're the kulaks!
[02:48:16.636 --> 02:48:17.896]  We're the Holodomor.
[02:48:17.896 --> 02:48:19.937]  We're the Ukrainian farmers.
[02:48:19.937 --> 02:48:21.438]  We are literally the Kulaks.
[02:48:21.438 --> 02:48:21.978]  They're all coming for us.
[02:48:21.978 --> 02:48:31.761]  Well, the very same British intelligence money, as you know, you're informed, that ran the Communist takeover of Russia, where the British royals killed their cousins, the Tsar, is the same group doing this again.
[02:48:31.761 --> 02:48:32.301]  Exactly.
[02:48:32.301 --> 02:48:34.682]  So people now, too many people have woken up.
[02:48:34.682 --> 02:48:37.363]  That's why I'm optimistic.
[02:48:37.363 --> 02:48:40.784]  I know that a few of us are going to be assassinated.
[02:48:40.784 --> 02:48:42.144]  Me, you.
[02:48:42.144 --> 02:48:42.665]  We're going to.
[02:48:42.665 --> 02:48:43.165]  There's just no
[02:48:44.125 --> 02:48:45.746]  There's no way around it.
[02:48:45.746 --> 02:48:55.634]  That's why I read all the great warrior philosophy and I've resigned myself already to knowing that they are going to assassinate me.
[02:48:55.634 --> 02:48:55.654]  100%.
[02:48:55.654 --> 02:48:58.696]  There's just no question about it.
[02:48:58.696 --> 02:49:01.158]  I've had to resign to that as well.
[02:49:01.158 --> 02:49:02.019]  Every day is a blessing.
[02:49:02.159 --> 02:49:07.764]  Yeah, they're getting you civilly, and then they'll go for you criminally, and then, oh, we found drugs in his possession.
[02:49:07.764 --> 02:49:10.687]  He was under so much stress, he killed his family and himself.
[02:49:10.687 --> 02:49:11.028]  Never.
[02:49:11.028 --> 02:49:12.749]  That happens.
[02:49:12.749 --> 02:49:15.812]  And you've got to just say, they're going to get my kids anyways.
[02:49:15.812 --> 02:49:19.196]  It's the opposite of abandoning all hope.
[02:49:19.196 --> 02:49:22.018]  Turn it over to God, and say, I have no fear, I'm going into this.
[02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:23.920]  It's the opposite of abandoning all hope, because
[02:49:24.941 --> 02:49:28.304]  Stress or anxiety only comes from uncertainty.
[02:49:28.304 --> 02:49:29.486]  I know what they're doing.
[02:49:29.486 --> 02:49:30.887]  I know what they're plotting.
[02:49:30.887 --> 02:49:31.828]  I know what they're thinking.
[02:49:31.828 --> 02:49:35.652]  I've war-gamed it out five steps ahead of them, and I know all their moves.
[02:49:35.652 --> 02:49:38.695]  Tell them what you see coming.
[02:49:38.695 --> 02:49:43.679]  Well, you think Garland and the FBI are going to be happy with what has happened?
[02:49:43.679 --> 02:49:46.842]  Their human sacrifice was stopped in front of them.
[02:49:47.463 --> 02:49:51.366]  This was, to them, a form of ritualistic human sacrifice.
[02:49:51.366 --> 02:49:53.607]  Sacrificing the right of self-defense on an altar.
[02:49:53.607 --> 02:49:54.068]  Yeah.
[02:49:54.068 --> 02:50:02.834]  And they were sacrificing a child, too, because, remember, the sacrifice of the people who have this religion, they always want to sacrifice the younger people, the innocent people.
[02:50:02.834 --> 02:50:04.915]  That's how they believe they get more of the spiritual magic.
[02:50:04.915 --> 02:50:05.175]  Exactly.
[02:50:05.175 --> 02:50:10.519]  The fact that he was an innocent hero is just like Burning Man or Wicker Man is who they want.
[02:50:10.879 --> 02:50:14.720]  Yeah, so the only thing keeping you alive and me alive is we're all men now with gray hair.
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:16.541]  We're not the veal to them.
[02:50:16.541 --> 02:50:19.242]  We're old, chewy, sinewy meat.
[02:50:19.242 --> 02:50:29.426]  They'll figure out ways to get us here and there, but they really want the blood ritual sacrifice of the underage, and that's why, of course, they went after Rittenhouse, and they're screaming now.
[02:50:29.426 --> 02:50:35.948]  What people have to realize is they will infiltrate more and more any conservative group.
[02:50:35.948 --> 02:50:39.610]  You have to be vigilant, and you have to, anytime somebody talks about violence,
[02:50:40.370 --> 02:50:40.810]  Get him out of there.
[02:50:40.810 --> 02:50:41.731]  You know they're a provocateur.
[02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:42.732]  Get him out of there.
[02:50:42.732 --> 02:50:47.415]  Anytime somebody's walking around, a hot shot, tough guy, we have to do more.
[02:50:47.415 --> 02:50:48.355]  We can't just talk.
[02:50:48.355 --> 02:50:50.177]  The time for talking is gone.
[02:50:50.177 --> 02:50:53.219]  There's little lines all these little infiltrator feds Stasi has.
[02:50:53.219 --> 02:50:56.421]  They'll say, Cernovich, all you do is talk.
[02:50:56.421 --> 02:50:58.342]  It's time to take action.
[02:50:58.342 --> 02:50:59.443]  Okay, Fed.
[02:50:59.443 --> 02:51:00.864]  Nice try, Fed.
[02:51:00.864 --> 02:51:02.405]  Nice try, Infiltrator.
[02:51:02.405 --> 02:51:03.826]  Nice try, Stasi.
[02:51:03.826 --> 02:51:06.448]  What everyone has to do is if you're going to be politically involved,
[02:51:07.128 --> 02:51:09.230]  Again, remember what Jesus said.
[02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:12.354]  You have to be gentle as a dove, but they forget the first part.
[02:51:12.354 --> 02:51:14.035]  Wise as a serpent.
[02:51:14.035 --> 02:51:16.718]  You know, we were talking yesterday about... Yeah, we have knowledge of evil.
[02:51:16.718 --> 02:51:21.283]  We don't use our knowledge of evil, but we know as much as their top operators.
[02:51:21.283 --> 02:51:24.547]  That's how I... I just get in their mind, I get in their head, and I think like them.
[02:51:24.547 --> 02:51:26.449]  That's how I know what they're going to do.
[02:51:26.449 --> 02:51:27.610]  That's as wise as a serpent.
[02:51:27.967 --> 02:51:32.449]  Right, so the false prophets will say, be gentle as doves.
[02:51:32.449 --> 02:51:33.450]  Well, that's not the first.
[02:51:33.450 --> 02:51:35.491]  I've read the Bible multiple times.
[02:51:35.491 --> 02:51:40.894]  In fact, Jesus was an expert at avoiding the riddles that the Pharisees would give him.
[02:51:40.894 --> 02:51:45.076]  The Sophists and the Pharisees would constantly try to... Get him to break the laws, they'd kill him.
[02:51:45.196 --> 02:51:49.981]  I would say, oh, you're a tax evader, so what do you do about taxes, hoping that they can trap him?
[02:51:49.981 --> 02:51:57.309]  So what I tell people is we have to be wise as serpents, and serpents, of course, goes back to the metaphor of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:58.790]  So that's what he's saying there.
[02:51:58.790 --> 02:52:00.952]  If you go back and look at that, it is a deep metaphor.
[02:52:00.952 --> 02:52:07.619]  Christ is saying, you have to have knowledge, not just of good, you have to be good, but you have to have knowledge of evil.
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:13.884]  And what happens with these naive Christians who are led astray by false prophets is they don't have knowledge of evil.
[02:52:13.884 --> 02:52:18.407]  They think when you talk about demons, oh, I can't believe you believe in demons, that sounds... you can't believe it?
[02:52:18.407 --> 02:52:21.269]  Jesus cast out legion because there are many.
[02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:24.271]  I often wonder how many of these Christian conservatives have read the Bible.
[02:52:24.271 --> 02:52:25.111]  We think it's a metaphor.
[02:52:25.111 --> 02:52:26.733]  We don't really believe... well, I believe in demons.
[02:52:26.733 --> 02:52:27.313]  I know it's real.
[02:52:27.313 --> 02:52:28.494]  Jesus cast them out!
[02:52:28.494 --> 02:52:30.335]  And they put them in the animals and ran them off the coast.
[02:52:30.335 --> 02:52:32.196]  It's an interdimensional avatar.
[02:52:32.196 --> 02:52:33.337]  And we're an open channel.
[02:52:33.337 --> 02:52:34.077]  They can take... they're real.
[02:52:34.958 --> 02:52:36.299]  He said, the demons said, I am legion.
[02:52:36.299 --> 02:52:37.859]  They call me legion because I'm many.
[02:52:37.859 --> 02:52:41.500]  And then Christians will say, I can't believe Cernovich is talking about demons.
[02:52:41.500 --> 02:52:45.202]  Well, I can tell you, without DMT and all this stuff, I don't even need hallucinations.
[02:52:45.202 --> 02:52:47.202]  When I was especially a kid, I could see it all.
[02:52:47.202 --> 02:52:48.703]  There's the veils thinner when you're a child.
[02:52:48.703 --> 02:52:50.804]  You've got a lot more DMT already in your brain.
[02:52:50.804 --> 02:52:51.124]  And it's 100% real.
[02:52:52.611 --> 02:52:54.392]  And all you have to do is read the Bible, right?
[02:52:54.392 --> 02:53:00.816]  So, the false prophets weaponize the part about being gentle as a dove to lead people astray.
[02:53:00.816 --> 02:53:04.638]  They claim that demons are a metaphor, they're not actually real, even though that's not biblical.
[02:53:04.638 --> 02:53:07.060]  That's actually heresy, false teachings of the Bible.
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:11.122]  If you tell people demons aren't real, you're actually a false teacher.
[02:53:11.122 --> 02:53:13.223]  Because Christ himself cast out demons.
[02:53:13.223 --> 02:53:16.105]  The devil's greatest trip was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:53:17.078 --> 02:53:19.159]  That's the move that they want to play.
[02:53:19.159 --> 02:53:26.382]  What I'm telling the Christians especially, you have to wise as a serpent, and what that means is you have to have knowledge of good and evil.
[02:53:26.382 --> 02:53:29.583]  Live good, but know the evil people are plotting.
[02:53:29.583 --> 02:53:32.464]  The evil people are thinking, how can we frame... Exactly.
[02:53:32.464 --> 02:53:37.126]  They try to make Christians super naive, and they go, oh, BS, you don't know how anything works.
[02:53:37.126 --> 02:53:37.766]  Act like an idiot.
[02:53:37.766 --> 02:53:38.486]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:53:38.486 --> 02:53:39.487]  You need to know how it all works.
[02:53:39.907 --> 02:53:42.389]  Right, that's exactly the point.
[02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:49.654]  Again, the false prophets have taught Christians to be naive, gullible, to turn the other cheek.
[02:53:49.654 --> 02:53:53.537]  Well, turning the other cheek actually was a metaphor because... That's only at certain times.
[02:53:53.537 --> 02:53:58.141]  Yeah, and because the person wiped their butt with their other hand.
[02:53:58.141 --> 02:54:00.562]  So there's more metaphor to that than people even realize.
[02:54:02.184 --> 02:54:07.185]  That itself is taught incorrectly by people who want Christians to be naive.
[02:54:07.185 --> 02:54:12.307]  Oh, turn the other cheek, let people steamroll you, be gentle as a dove.
[02:54:12.307 --> 02:54:14.647]  That's not biblical.
[02:54:14.647 --> 02:54:21.989]  If you read the Bible, which again, unfortunately not enough people have, you realize it is good versus evil, it is demonic.
[02:54:21.989 --> 02:54:25.690]  Well, if you read the Psalms, there's a place and time for everything.
[02:54:25.690 --> 02:54:26.450]  It's a toolkit.
[02:54:27.210 --> 02:54:31.415]  So sometimes they're trying to make you violent so they can take you out right then on their terms.
[02:54:31.415 --> 02:54:33.116]  Sometimes you're like Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:54:33.116 --> 02:54:36.200]  or Gandhi following Christ because he was to be a sacrifice.
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:37.521]  He wasn't going to let them trick him.
[02:54:37.521 --> 02:54:40.044]  He was going to do the big public sacrifice.
[02:54:40.044 --> 02:54:43.067]  They were to kill him in the woods right there instead of up in front of everybody.
[02:54:43.067 --> 02:54:44.789]  So you got to choose your battles is what that's about.
[02:54:45.229 --> 02:54:51.136]  Yeah, they do try to bait us into their game, but that's where you have to realize they're trying to bait you into evil.
[02:54:51.136 --> 02:54:55.180]  So if you're doing political organizing, you have to keep these people out of your group.
[02:54:55.180 --> 02:54:58.043]  Because they are Feds, they are infiltrators, they are Stasi.
[02:54:58.043 --> 02:55:00.946]  Anybody talks about violence, anybody talks about incitement...
[02:55:01.846 --> 02:55:06.427]  Anybody talks about, oh, we can't just talk, we have to do more, blah, blah.
[02:55:06.427 --> 02:55:09.048]  You have to get rid of them or else you're going to end up set up.
[02:55:09.048 --> 02:55:18.610]  Well, I always tell folks, if you won't politically get involved and be civil disobedient and do all that now in a tyranny space, you'll never be violent when the time actually comes.
[02:55:18.610 --> 02:55:20.630]  They roll out with mass arrests, all this stuff.
[02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:25.731]  The military and police are going to join us on average, and it's going to be a violent worldwide civil war against the globalists.
[02:55:25.731 --> 02:55:26.791]  It's already about to start in Europe.
[02:55:26.791 --> 02:55:28.131]  We're not calling for that.
[02:55:28.131 --> 02:55:28.992]  We don't initiate that.
[02:55:28.992 --> 02:55:29.912]  Go back to Bunker Hill.
[02:55:30.652 --> 02:55:42.942]  When 1775, and the founding of this country, and the Redcoats are marching up, you know, 5 to 1 against the little local militia to confiscate the guns and the ammo, and they've been told by the local mayor and everybody, you know, we're voting to stand up, we're not turning our guns in, that's too far.
[02:55:42.942 --> 02:55:50.408]  And they said, listen, and I'm paraphrasing it, but the captain said, he died that day, he said, we're not looking for a war, we're not going to start a fight, we're not going to shoot first.
[02:55:50.408 --> 02:55:52.910]  But if they shoot, if it's a war they want, it's a war they get.
[02:55:54.311 --> 02:55:59.936]  What you said a minute ago was so wise, and I'm going to take that and adopt that.
[02:55:59.936 --> 02:56:08.243]  Which is, yeah, if you won't show up to your school board meeting because you're afraid that the media is going to do a nasty article on you and you're going to lose your job, then how are you talking about violence?
[02:56:08.903 --> 02:56:09.324]  Right?
[02:56:09.324 --> 02:56:10.645]  You're afraid of losing your job.
[02:56:10.645 --> 02:56:14.228]  You won't even stand up for your own children in school because you want to lose your job.
[02:56:14.228 --> 02:56:16.270]  But then you're saying other people need to be violent.
[02:56:16.270 --> 02:56:17.351]  So that's a great point.
[02:56:17.351 --> 02:56:26.579]  If you don't have political courage and their willingness to stand up to what's happening now civilly and lawfully and politically, then get out of here with your fake BS.
[02:56:26.579 --> 02:56:28.021]  You're such a tough guy.
[02:56:28.021 --> 02:56:33.826]  Well, the people calling for violence always end up to be a Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, or FBI operative, scum of the earth.
[02:56:34.827 --> 02:56:41.770]  When you're sitting there, because I've had to try this before, years ago, it had to happen a while, and I'm like, oh, but you're not going to be violent.
[02:56:41.770 --> 02:56:43.271]  You want me to be violent.
[02:56:43.271 --> 02:56:43.711]  You see that?
[02:56:43.711 --> 02:56:45.772]  That's the real telltale sign.
[02:56:45.772 --> 02:56:46.172]  Oh, really?
[02:56:46.172 --> 02:56:47.052]  We're all cowards?
[02:56:47.052 --> 02:56:49.433]  We haven't gone out and killed a cop or blown something up?
[02:56:49.433 --> 02:56:51.354]  How come we haven't seen you do that?
[02:56:51.354 --> 02:56:53.155]  You're the one telling us all this violence.
[02:56:53.675 --> 02:57:04.558]  We had a thing happen, um, I had a, when I was in Arizona, a guy with a big Trump 45 jersey was trying to initiate, or he was trying to get a riot to happen.
[02:57:04.558 --> 02:57:07.079]  He took a water bottle and threw it at these people.
[02:57:07.079 --> 02:57:08.540]  And I said, Hey man, what are you doing?
[02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.260]  Why are you doing this?
[02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:11.501]  And he goes, I'm going to be like Jesus.
[02:57:11.501 --> 02:57:13.661]  And Jesus flipped over the tables at the tabernacles.
[02:57:13.661 --> 02:57:15.722]  And I said, that's my event.
[02:57:15.722 --> 02:57:17.422]  And he goes, I don't care if it's your event.
[02:57:17.422 --> 02:57:18.383]  This is like Jesus.
[02:57:18.383 --> 02:57:19.303]  And I go, Oh, okay.
[02:57:19.303 --> 02:57:20.343]  I know what you're doing.
[02:57:20.343 --> 02:57:22.024]  This is my liberation theology.
[02:57:22.284 --> 02:57:23.485]  But you don't respect it.
[02:57:23.485 --> 02:57:35.453]  If it's my event, and you have a big Trump 45 Blackhawks jersey on, and you're throwing water bottles at people's heads to try to get something going on, I know right away that that guy was in a hole.
[02:57:35.453 --> 02:57:35.593]  Oh, 100%.
[02:57:35.593 --> 02:57:37.735]  He was Southern Poverty Law Center trash.
[02:57:37.735 --> 02:57:39.476]  He's a Soros.
[02:57:39.476 --> 02:57:42.878]  I promise, back in two minutes, right to your calls with Mike Cernovich.
[02:57:42.878 --> 02:57:43.559]  I'm Alex Jones.

[03:00:01.979 --> 03:00:08.043]  Alright, I promise to go to your calls, and I appreciate everybody holding.
[03:00:08.043 --> 03:00:19.630]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here, and that would be... That'd be Robert in Florida.
[03:00:19.630 --> 03:00:21.491]  Robert, you're on the air with Mike Cernovich, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.491 --> 03:00:23.532]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[03:00:23.532 --> 03:00:25.493]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[03:00:25.493 --> 03:00:26.214]  I have a question.
[03:00:26.881 --> 03:00:37.388]  In the end game, when this is all over down here on this earth, this wicked system, do you believe that Lucifer or Satan will be the one losing in the end?
[03:00:37.388 --> 03:00:38.949]  Oh, I know the devil's going to lose.
[03:00:38.949 --> 03:00:44.132]  I mean, the devil can't help the program the devil runs, and God gave us free will, so evil's going to exist.
[03:00:44.132 --> 03:00:47.435]  I mean, there's no way Satan wins.
[03:00:47.435 --> 03:00:48.856]  Mike, what's your take on that?
[03:00:48.856 --> 03:00:52.258]  Yeah, this has all been ordained.
[03:00:52.258 --> 03:00:55.240]  In the end, goodness wins, but it's going to be a while before that happens.
[03:00:56.195 --> 03:00:59.718]  I've been trying to get you here for a couple years, and this was set up months ago.
[03:00:59.718 --> 03:01:01.479]  You were going to come here now.
[03:01:01.479 --> 03:01:02.480]  You said that before we went live.
[03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:03.681]  You said this is ordained.
[03:01:03.681 --> 03:01:09.926]  Yeah, it was ordained that we were here during the persecution of Kyle Rittenhouse.
[03:01:09.926 --> 03:01:12.127]  That timing wasn't a coincidence, not at all.
[03:01:12.127 --> 03:01:12.828]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:01:12.828 --> 03:01:15.530]  Evil has its own system and its own little system.
[03:01:15.530 --> 03:01:21.515]  But when you start seeing the mysteries of God, the way it works, it's like, whoa, this is crazy.
[03:01:21.515 --> 03:01:24.417]  Yeah, it only takes a little bit of light to reveal the darkness.
[03:01:26.511 --> 03:01:26.831]  All right.
[03:01:26.831 --> 03:01:27.852]  Thank you so much, Robert.
[03:01:27.852 --> 03:01:28.673]  Appreciate your call.
[03:01:28.673 --> 03:01:30.274]  Great question.
[03:01:30.274 --> 03:01:32.256]  Let's go ahead and talk to Spencer.
[03:01:32.256 --> 03:01:33.437]  No, no, not Spencer.
[03:01:33.437 --> 03:01:34.798]  Sorry, I'm dumb.
[03:01:34.798 --> 03:01:37.840]  It'd be Jacob in California.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:38.501]  Jacob, welcome.
[03:01:38.501 --> 03:01:39.422]  Then Alex in Florida.
[03:01:39.422 --> 03:01:39.702]  Go ahead.
[03:01:39.702 --> 03:01:43.525]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[03:01:43.525 --> 03:01:44.766]  Long time listener.
[03:01:44.766 --> 03:01:47.789]  I've been listening since 2011.
[03:01:47.789 --> 03:01:49.730]  I'm truly awake to everything that's going on.
[03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:50.591]  I just want to know, like,
[03:01:51.454 --> 03:01:52.955]  How do we stop the New World Order?
[03:01:52.955 --> 03:02:02.959]  I mean, I try to tell people, I've been telling everybody about this New World Order agenda and they just act like they believe, but then I find out they went and took the vaccine.
[03:02:02.959 --> 03:02:05.780]  You know, like, I don't know why, I don't know what to do.
[03:02:06.920 --> 03:02:11.943]  Well yeah, a lot of people are in a trance, literally, medically, and they're in a daze.
[03:02:11.943 --> 03:02:15.965]  So they'll agree with you at that time, but it's only to be nice.
[03:02:15.965 --> 03:02:22.728]  But they feel compelled to get it, to conform, and they think they'll get out of the trap if they just give the bully what they want.
[03:02:22.728 --> 03:02:23.989]  They're literally being abused.
[03:02:23.989 --> 03:02:27.170]  So you've got to explain that to them, and then just move on.
[03:02:27.170 --> 03:02:28.871]  You're not going to save everybody.
[03:02:28.871 --> 03:02:31.133]  They have free will, and they've decided to be slaves.
[03:02:31.133 --> 03:02:31.953]  You want to comment on that?
[03:02:32.173 --> 03:02:43.389]  Yeah, that's the number one point that I make to people is you have to get over your save the world complex, save yourself, save your family, save people who want the message, right?
[03:02:43.389 --> 03:02:48.216]  Yeah, if your house isn't squared away and if your family isn't saved, then you're no business trying to help other people.
[03:02:48.396 --> 03:02:55.878]  Yeah, focus on that divine light within yourself because the divine light shines so brightly that then others will be drawn to it, like moths to the light.
[03:02:55.878 --> 03:03:00.159]  So for me, and if you hang out with me in real life, a lot of people are surprised.
[03:03:00.159 --> 03:03:03.880]  I talk about anything but the things that are happening in the world.
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:05.140]  I just hang out.
[03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:08.561]  And if people want to learn more and open their eyes, then that's fine.
[03:03:09.201 --> 03:03:10.542]  But otherwise I talk about anything.
[03:03:10.542 --> 03:03:11.403]  What you're saying is key.
[03:03:11.403 --> 03:03:14.666]  We have to build our own civilization and separate from them.
[03:03:14.666 --> 03:03:15.667]  You're right.
[03:03:15.667 --> 03:03:17.428]  Because then people will be attracted to that.
[03:03:17.428 --> 03:03:18.509]  The types we want.
[03:03:18.509 --> 03:03:21.472]  People that want filth and pedophilia and collapse, they're going to go to that.
[03:03:22.031 --> 03:03:34.279]  Yeah, you have all these people from California, liberals, moving to Texas, Florida, Idaho, but they're, unfortunately, I heard a good expression from someone, he said, that we welcome the refugees, but not the locusts.
[03:03:34.279 --> 03:03:38.462]  He's talking about the California people who are leaving California because it's gone insane.
[03:03:38.462 --> 03:03:49.350]  Well, I'm not trying to brag, but I said that years ago, but everybody probably gets the same analogy, I don't want to say I coined it, but yeah, that's it, we welcome refugees that want to escape it, but not the locusts.
[03:03:49.770 --> 03:03:50.190]  Right.
[03:03:50.190 --> 03:03:52.951]  So we know that inevitably people are leaving.
[03:03:52.951 --> 03:03:54.291]  California has net migration.
[03:03:54.291 --> 03:03:56.072]  I posted this a while ago on Twitter.
[03:03:56.072 --> 03:04:07.755]  If you look up the U-Haul rate for leaving California going to Texas or Arizona versus the other ways, three or four times as much to leave California because all the U-Hauls are based on the logistics.
[03:04:07.755 --> 03:04:08.555]  And let's go further.
[03:04:08.555 --> 03:04:12.056]  I think something like eight times more people are moving out, moving in.
[03:04:12.056 --> 03:04:16.057]  And those moving in are third world, who again, the globalists can exploit.
[03:04:17.382 --> 03:04:18.082]  Less and less so.
[03:04:18.082 --> 03:04:22.924]  I mean, the Virginia election showed a lot of good Hispanic turnout.
[03:04:22.924 --> 03:04:26.105]  So, the Republicans, DeSantis is doing alright.
[03:04:26.105 --> 03:04:28.166]  The Republican Party still has to get that.
[03:04:28.166 --> 03:04:28.666]  No, I hear you.
[03:04:28.666 --> 03:04:29.827]  Jacob, did you have anything else to add?
[03:04:31.215 --> 03:04:32.796]  Yeah, uh... Don't hang up!
[03:04:32.796 --> 03:04:33.116]  We're back.
[03:04:33.116 --> 03:04:34.257]  We're going to break for 60 seconds.
[03:04:34.257 --> 03:04:35.078]  Some stations join us.
[03:04:35.078 --> 03:04:37.320]  I'm going to come right back to Jacob.
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:41.343]  And again, Cernovich, you're saying you're not updating Cernovich.com, the best place?
[03:04:41.343 --> 03:04:42.363]  HoaxTheMovie.com.
[03:04:42.363 --> 03:04:43.584]  HoaxMovie.com.
[03:04:43.584 --> 03:04:45.105]  HoaxMovie.com.
[03:04:45.105 --> 03:04:48.528]  Glad to have Mike Cernovich here during this big day of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.
[03:04:48.528 --> 03:04:48.988]  And he's right.
[03:04:48.988 --> 03:04:50.549]  They're getting ready with dirty tricks.
[03:04:50.549 --> 03:04:51.910]  They're going to strike back big time.
[03:04:51.910 --> 03:04:54.512]  They'll probably blow up a federal building and say the guy did it for Kyle Rittenhouse.
[03:05:00.612 --> 03:05:02.694]  Your voice counts.
[03:05:02.694 --> 03:05:07.757]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[03:05:07.757 --> 03:05:10.339]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[03:05:10.339 --> 03:05:11.840]  They know you're angry.
[03:05:11.840 --> 03:05:17.244]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[03:05:17.244 --> 03:05:24.250]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,

[03:06:00.413 --> 03:06:03.215]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:06:03.215 --> 03:06:06.577]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:06.577 --> 03:06:13.441]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:06:15.524 --> 03:06:22.887]  Harping on war as we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[03:06:22.887 --> 03:06:28.929]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things they believe in.
[03:06:28.929 --> 03:06:33.691]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking
[03:06:34.506 --> 03:06:43.278]  Alright, we've got the filmmaker, lawyer, podcaster, Mike Cernovich here with us in studio.
[03:06:43.278 --> 03:06:46.102]  We're going right back to your phone calls, but I gotta raise this point.
[03:06:47.210 --> 03:07:10.533]  Because I don't talk about this enough, and you encapsulate it really well, and we can go into 100 hours of documentation and declassified CIA and Ford Foundation documents, but they said we want ugly culture, ugly buildings, we want to deconstruct, we don't want the old world to look good, because we're building a new world, but then what they build is even uglier, and so I don't understand the spiritual position, even though I can get in the enemy's mind, of wanting
[03:07:11.474 --> 03:07:21.131]  Because I can war game how they operate and I know how they behave, but I still can't get why they want to hurt innocents, why they want to make ugliness, why they want to kill the planet.
[03:07:21.131 --> 03:07:22.934]  Well, they said they want to save it.
[03:07:22.934 --> 03:07:23.776]  Well, that's...
[03:07:24.756 --> 03:07:25.197]  Evil.
[03:07:25.197 --> 03:07:31.743]  That's why we have to study evil and learn the nature of evil and the religion and the theology of evil.
[03:07:31.743 --> 03:07:35.746]  The theology of evil is fundamentally built on destruction.
[03:07:35.746 --> 03:07:37.348]  It's built on harming people.
[03:07:37.348 --> 03:07:38.509]  It's built on destroying things.
[03:07:38.509 --> 03:07:39.670]  That's their aesthetic.
[03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:41.612]  That's why everything is very dark.
[03:07:41.612 --> 03:07:45.535]  Everything is very... You can just feel the negativity.
[03:07:45.535 --> 03:07:50.400]  In the Old Testament, Moses was like, stop stabbing and cutting yourselves and hurting yourselves.
[03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:52.120]  Yeah, but that's their religion.
[03:07:52.120 --> 03:08:05.263]  That's what the biggest transition people need to make to wake up is realize that when you wake up and thank God for the day, and when you go to bed and you thank God for the day that you had, the demons have their religion too.
[03:08:05.263 --> 03:08:09.204]  The people who, unfortunately, have taken over the Democrat Party.
[03:08:09.204 --> 03:08:10.945]  I hate to think of half of the country.
[03:08:10.945 --> 03:08:11.885]  It is the demon party.
[03:08:12.285 --> 03:08:17.250]  I hate to really, I used to not like that kind of rhetoric, but after Rittenhouse, it's really hard to see.
[03:08:17.250 --> 03:08:23.436]  Otherwise, when they're defending literally a serial child rapist, there's no other, there's no other way to explain it, what they are now.
[03:08:23.436 --> 03:08:25.158]  There's team Freedom and there's team Damon.
[03:08:26.814 --> 03:08:28.135]  They want to destroy everything.
[03:08:28.135 --> 03:08:30.536]  They want to get their little feet in and destroy everything.
[03:08:30.536 --> 03:08:33.777]  Because to them, human suffering is their religion.
[03:08:33.777 --> 03:08:34.217]  Right?
[03:08:34.217 --> 03:08:35.738]  That's what people have to understand.
[03:08:35.738 --> 03:08:37.479]  There's virtue and there's vice.
[03:08:37.479 --> 03:08:40.780]  That's why they get vice on people, because they get people hooked to drugs.
[03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:42.741]  That's why we have 100,000 overdoses a year.
[03:08:42.741 --> 03:08:44.201]  So it's kill, steal, and destroy.
[03:08:44.201 --> 03:08:46.282]  And I guess there's no reforming demons, is there?
[03:08:46.442 --> 03:08:47.823]  Well, no, because that's their energy.
[03:08:47.823 --> 03:08:50.366]  Their energy comes from human suffering, right?
[03:08:50.366 --> 03:08:53.669]  So once you understand the energy... From your research, where do these things come from?
[03:08:53.669 --> 03:08:54.890]  Like, why are they allowed to operate?
[03:08:54.890 --> 03:09:00.816]  Because I'd get free will, but if I had free will, I wouldn't even... I mean, if these demons weren't running around this bad, I wouldn't even have to deal with it.
[03:09:00.816 --> 03:09:04.720]  Like, I'm sure we'd still have problems, but my God, these are some nasty suckers.
[03:09:05.609 --> 03:09:11.851]  Well, that goes into theology of why would... and it goes to the simulation conversation that we had yesterday, which is C.S.
[03:09:11.851 --> 03:09:14.192]  Lewis and others have talked about, you know, the problem of evil.
[03:09:14.192 --> 03:09:15.873]  Why does evil exist?
[03:09:15.873 --> 03:09:24.856]  And evil exists, unfortunately, because it allows you to find virtue, for you to ascend to another level, and to test you and your godliness.
[03:09:24.856 --> 03:09:25.757]  That's why it exists.
[03:09:26.684 --> 03:09:29.168]  And it also couldn't be otherwise.
[03:09:29.168 --> 03:09:31.632]  You can't have an upside without a downside.
[03:09:31.632 --> 03:09:35.818]  Sure, but God's all about free will, so God's not animating these things.
[03:09:35.818 --> 03:09:40.425]  These are people, entities, spirits, whatever they were, that decided to become this.
[03:09:40.967 --> 03:09:48.090]  And he created us, and some of us will ascend to heaven, and some of us, well, they're choosing that they want to go to hell and dwell in darkness for eternity.
[03:09:48.090 --> 03:09:54.193]  So that's what it comes down to, too, is we have to realize that what happens here matters, what we do matters.
[03:09:54.193 --> 03:09:55.314]  This is a trial, though.
[03:09:55.314 --> 03:09:56.314]  We're all on trial.
[03:09:56.314 --> 03:09:58.155]  Rittenhouse was just on trial.
[03:09:58.155 --> 03:10:00.296]  The real trial is for our immortal souls.
[03:10:00.936 --> 03:10:03.597]  Every day that we walk this earth, we're on trial.
[03:10:03.597 --> 03:10:07.318]  That's why Evil put Kyle Rittenhouse on trial.
[03:10:07.318 --> 03:10:11.039]  But that's a reminder that we're watching the Kyle Rittenhouse trial.
[03:10:11.039 --> 03:10:12.440]  No, we're on trial.
[03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:14.620]  Our nature is being tested every day.
[03:10:14.620 --> 03:10:20.082]  We fail sometimes, we succeed sometimes, but we're always trying to take that trend line to a higher level.
[03:10:20.802 --> 03:10:23.724]  The trial is non-stop, it's never-ending.
[03:10:23.724 --> 03:10:27.906]  Rittenhouse will be on trial the rest of his life, not just for the system, but also for his soul.
[03:10:27.906 --> 03:10:36.252]  The more that we focus on and contextualize what's happening to us, as it isn't just a worldly temporary moment,
[03:10:37.012 --> 03:10:41.013]  This is part of the never-ending, unrelenting battle in our life.
[03:10:41.013 --> 03:10:41.613]  I totally agree.
[03:10:41.613 --> 03:10:45.314]  We're going to have calls, but is it the archetype of everything Rittenhouse?
[03:10:45.314 --> 03:10:49.015]  Like he's kind of goofy, not wimpy, but not like super manly.
[03:10:49.015 --> 03:10:52.116]  And then he doesn't like stand in a prone position and kill him when he's defending himself.
[03:10:52.116 --> 03:10:54.117]  He's down on his back.
[03:10:54.117 --> 03:10:54.697]  He's defending.
[03:10:54.697 --> 03:10:56.438]  I mean, all of it's archetypal.
[03:10:56.438 --> 03:10:57.518]  It's extremely archetypal.
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:02.083]  He was the prodigal son in many ways.
[03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:08.166]  It's archetypal to the degree that my mother-in-law is a CNN-watching leftist.
[03:11:08.166 --> 03:11:17.933]  She's not like these demon worshippers because she cried during the Rittenhouse testimony and she said, because she finally actually watched some of the trial, she said to Shauna, how are they doing this to that poor boy?
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:24.585]  So even died-in-the-wool Democrat voters, like my mother-in-law, saw what happened.
[03:11:24.585 --> 03:11:26.446]  I call it the persecution of St.
[03:11:26.446 --> 03:11:29.349]  Kyle, is what we just witnessed.
[03:11:29.349 --> 03:11:42.039]  And I saw that Democrats, like my mother-in-law, realized that maybe that opened the door a little bit to understand that everything... Well that's it, the demons, the devils in control manipulate the goodness in people too.
[03:11:42.039 --> 03:11:44.562]  That's what's really sad is they've got... I said like,
[03:11:45.342 --> 03:11:49.524]  Satan's carriage is actually, like, pulled by a bunch of well-meaning people that are deceived.
[03:11:49.524 --> 03:11:51.205]  Well, evil always goes too far, too.
[03:11:51.205 --> 03:11:52.465]  That's what we have to understand.
[03:11:52.465 --> 03:11:55.587]  That's why we have to always hold ourselves to a higher standard.
[03:11:55.587 --> 03:11:56.307]  Yeah, not go too far.
[03:11:56.307 --> 03:11:58.468]  Yeah, because evil will always go too far.
[03:11:58.468 --> 03:12:00.489]  Going after Kyle Rittenhouse was too far.
[03:12:00.489 --> 03:12:02.330]  It was tactically unsound.
[03:12:02.330 --> 03:12:14.435]  If I were part of the demon squad and we were round-tabling things and working on a whiteboard in the demon war room, and they said, hey, we're going to lynch a 17-year-old who killed a serial pedophile.
[03:12:15.250 --> 03:12:16.451]  I was trying to kill him.
[03:12:16.451 --> 03:12:17.292]  Yeah, I was trying to kill him.
[03:12:17.292 --> 03:12:18.993]  I would say, no we're not.
[03:12:18.993 --> 03:12:19.833]  You're absurd.
[03:12:19.833 --> 03:12:23.416]  By the way, speaking of round table demons, I haven't played the verdict again.
[03:12:23.416 --> 03:12:25.478]  I haven't played.
[03:12:25.478 --> 03:12:28.320]  Biden came out to show the video, talk about demon circle.
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:31.502]  He's saying, I believe in juries and saying, drop it.
[03:12:31.502 --> 03:12:33.584]  So even he gets it's a losing deal.
[03:12:33.584 --> 03:12:36.026]  And he's going to be sued for those lies that he spread.
[03:12:36.026 --> 03:12:37.287]  We call him a lie supremacist.
[03:12:37.287 --> 03:12:38.628]  Yeah, he's going to be sued for all that.
[03:12:38.628 --> 03:12:39.588]  A lot of people look at him.
[03:12:39.588 --> 03:12:41.270]  I mean, you want to talk about a senile.
[03:12:41.270 --> 03:12:42.491]  Oh, that's a demon right there.
[03:12:43.251 --> 03:12:53.948]  So they're all concerned now because they know that they're all going to be sued by Rittenhouse and Rittenhouse will have the biggest legal defense fund in human history when he goes after all these people.
[03:12:53.948 --> 03:12:57.493]  And yeah, Biden's realizing, oh man, this is bad for us.
[03:12:57.493 --> 03:12:57.874]  There's no...
[03:12:58.675 --> 03:13:05.861]  The only reason that they are even able to get away with what they're getting away with is Republicans haven't gone hard enough onto this angle.
[03:13:05.861 --> 03:13:11.766]  If Republicans really talked like you and I talked, they would have 300 seats in the House.
[03:13:11.766 --> 03:13:13.207]  Oh, they would win overnight.
[03:13:13.207 --> 03:13:15.069]  But they're all intimidated by CNN.
[03:13:15.069 --> 03:13:17.951]  This is the most important thing you've said on a lot of important stuff.
[03:13:19.452 --> 03:13:37.354]  The Republicans are like a lion tamed by a mouse, and the mouse is like a little whip, and the lion's like... I mean, they're just so afraid of everything the Democrats... People... I mean, I don't want to give them secrets, but Politico, like 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, when Rand Paul won the Senate, and we helped get him elected, and they called and they go...
[03:13:38.084 --> 03:13:39.806]  How do we defeat him next time?
[03:13:39.806 --> 03:13:41.507]  And I said, endorsing.
[03:13:41.507 --> 03:13:44.170]  If Politico had endorsed Paul, he would have lost.
[03:13:44.170 --> 03:13:52.058]  Like, I'm like, these people call up and go, we're gonna destroy you on HBO, we're gonna destroy you in this thing, in Netflix, and I go, good, make it as horrible as you can.
[03:13:53.652 --> 03:13:58.155]  I mean, but they're so arrogant, they have a blind spot, that like, the public hates you!
[03:13:58.155 --> 03:14:01.057]  The more you attack me, the more... They don't get it, they just don't understand it.
[03:14:01.057 --> 03:14:03.199]  Well, again, evil has no limit.
[03:14:03.199 --> 03:14:06.261]  There's no limit to nihilism, there's no limit to evil.
[03:14:06.261 --> 03:14:09.424]  But that leads them, that's how we lead them astray.
[03:14:09.424 --> 03:14:17.249]  Going back to when Jesus talked about knowledge of good and evil and to be as wise as a serpent and as gentle as a dove, what we do is we're leading them astray.
[03:14:17.249 --> 03:14:19.231]  Oh yeah, go defend pedophiles!
[03:14:19.631 --> 03:14:20.252]  Go do that!
[03:14:20.252 --> 03:14:26.558]  Oh wait, now you've defended them, and now we can say for the rest of your life, you defend pedophiles, and they go, well I'll sue you for... Oh really?
[03:14:26.558 --> 03:14:27.739]  Here's your tweet!
[03:14:27.739 --> 03:14:28.359]  Here's your tweet!
[03:14:28.359 --> 03:14:28.960]  You did!
[03:14:28.960 --> 03:14:30.481]  You literally defend pedophiles.
[03:14:30.481 --> 03:14:41.051]  So we need the Republican Party, en masse, to come out and say that we demand that every Democrat disavow pedophiles.
[03:14:41.852 --> 03:14:45.376]  We demand there's a life sentence for pedophiles.
[03:14:45.376 --> 03:14:46.738]  Oh my God, that's so good.
[03:14:46.738 --> 03:14:48.680]  The anti-pedophile pledge.
[03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:48.900]  Yes.
[03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:50.862]  Because the Democrats are endorsing them everywhere.
[03:14:50.862 --> 03:14:51.983]  Oh, that's genius.
[03:14:51.983 --> 03:14:52.804]  Yes.
[03:14:52.804 --> 03:14:55.708]  Yeah, but of course, no Republican will do it.
[03:14:55.708 --> 03:14:56.729]  They're just too dumb.
[03:14:57.870 --> 03:15:00.811]  They don't have the divine fire because they're the false prophets.
[03:15:00.811 --> 03:15:05.774]  If you have the divine fire, the divine fire seeks also to burn away evil.
[03:15:05.774 --> 03:15:11.956]  And if they have that divine spark within themselves, they would just say, Ilhan Omar, why are you defending a paedophile?
[03:15:11.956 --> 03:15:13.237]  A serial paedophile?
[03:15:13.237 --> 03:15:16.318]  They would be... Yeah, they never use the weapons they've got.
[03:15:16.318 --> 03:15:16.819]  Right.
[03:15:16.819 --> 03:15:17.939]  All they have to do is pick them up.
[03:15:17.939 --> 03:15:19.320]  The victories are in their hands.
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:20.140]  It's easy.
[03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:22.261]  All they have to do is pick them up.
[03:15:22.261 --> 03:15:24.962]  The birthright of the planet and the universe is ours.
[03:15:24.962 --> 03:15:26.383]  We've got free will, we've got to take it.
[03:15:26.971 --> 03:15:32.776]  And that's why when we're attacked, and I've been attacked, they've made whole movies about me, written books about me to attack me.
[03:15:32.776 --> 03:15:37.540]  I'm sure that they'll attack me more, assassinate me, real and metaphorically.
[03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:41.664]  But that only turned me into someone who hates pedophiles.
[03:15:41.664 --> 03:15:47.149]  They went out of their way to smear me, but most people go, I looked you up and apparently you hate pedophiles.
[03:15:47.149 --> 03:15:49.030]  That's your thing you're known for.
[03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.791]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:49.791 --> 03:15:50.151]  Stay with us.
[03:15:50.151 --> 03:15:51.813]  I promise I'm going to your calls.
[03:15:51.813 --> 03:15:53.695]  This is the segment, going right to you.
[03:15:55.205 --> 03:15:56.206]  What if you could cut...
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:22.030]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:16:22.030 --> 03:16:28.796]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[03:16:28.796 --> 03:16:30.217]  But there is only two things to do.
[03:16:31.318 --> 03:16:34.479]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[03:16:34.479 --> 03:16:37.779]  If enough people awaken from the cult spell, then we win.
[03:16:37.779 --> 03:16:43.181]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[03:16:43.181 --> 03:16:45.001]  And so we must prepare.
[03:16:45.001 --> 03:16:56.143]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:16:56.143 --> 03:16:57.544]  I know you're humble.
[03:16:57.544 --> 03:16:58.264]  I know you're like me.
[03:16:59.224 --> 03:17:12.072]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[03:17:12.072 --> 03:17:14.414]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end, and 2022
[03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:18.961]  It begins to dawn.
[03:17:18.961 --> 03:17:25.185]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are, that you be more active than you've ever been.
[03:17:25.185 --> 03:17:27.707]  The tip of the spear is Van Dot Millionaire.
[03:17:27.707 --> 03:17:30.849]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is infootworks.com.
[03:17:31.889 --> 03:17:36.514]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[03:17:36.514 --> 03:17:41.358]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:17:41.358 --> 03:17:42.880]  That's SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:54.211]  And continue to go to M4WarsStore.com, where right now, we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours of energy, back in stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[03:17:56.341 --> 03:18:01.726]  It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film, In Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[03:18:01.726 --> 03:18:14.716]  And in that documentary, I predicted that globalists would establish world government by releasing a virus, demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns, and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society.
[03:18:14.716 --> 03:18:15.417]  And now they've done it.
[03:18:16.420 --> 03:18:17.480]  How did I know they would do it?
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:24.123]  Because they wrote books and white papers, and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked.
[03:18:24.123 --> 03:18:34.186]  You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg Group, whose head at the time was Klaus Schwab, and our sources inside were confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this Great Reset.
[03:18:34.186 --> 03:18:35.606]  Well, we're now living in it.
[03:18:35.606 --> 03:18:43.649]  The purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world, not its assets, the tyrannical corporate world government, the total censorship, no due process,
[03:18:44.329 --> 03:18:48.751]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news.
[03:19:04.312 --> 03:19:19.095]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[03:19:20.325 --> 03:19:25.308]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[03:19:25.308 --> 03:19:27.030]  It's not on the national news.
[03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:29.451]  And it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[03:19:29.451 --> 03:19:30.412]  It's just crazy.
[03:19:30.412 --> 03:19:35.815]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[03:19:35.815 --> 03:19:37.216]  It doesn't hurt anybody.
[03:19:37.216 --> 03:19:39.498]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[03:19:39.498 --> 03:19:40.859]  It's just crazy.
[03:19:40.859 --> 03:19:45.762]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[03:19:45.762 --> 03:19:48.784]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[03:19:48.784 --> 03:19:50.165]  That's why Infowars is on air.
[03:19:50.706 --> 03:19:53.770]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[03:19:53.770 --> 03:19:54.771]  This is just insane.
[03:19:54.771 --> 03:19:59.517]  These people are killers.
[03:19:59.517 --> 03:20:02.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.570 --> 03:20:30.517]  Well, you didn't ask Alex Jones, I gave you the answer.
[03:20:30.517 --> 03:20:34.518]  I got what I was after, long before I died.
[03:20:34.518 --> 03:20:40.961]  By the way, I forgot I got Carl Rittenhouse's cell phone number.
[03:20:42.193 --> 03:20:43.614]  I was like, hey, we have his contact, right?
[03:20:43.614 --> 03:20:45.696]  His mom's been on the show.
[03:20:45.696 --> 03:20:47.778]  And so we'll try to get him on as soon as we can.
[03:20:47.778 --> 03:20:50.361]  And we're also trying to get his lawyers on the show.
[03:20:50.361 --> 03:20:52.162]  We got a lawyer right here with us, Mike Cernovich.
[03:20:52.162 --> 03:20:53.283]  I promised to go to phone calls.
[03:20:53.283 --> 03:20:54.725]  We're doing it right now.
[03:20:54.725 --> 03:20:58.808]  I got to tell you, Cernovich, this is one hell of a time to be alive, isn't it?
[03:20:58.808 --> 03:21:06.596]  You know, we pray for interesting times and we get the interesting times and then we get mad at God that our prayers were answered.
[03:21:06.596 --> 03:21:07.977]  The paradox of humanity.
[03:21:09.289 --> 03:21:10.089]  I'm not mad, though.
[03:21:10.089 --> 03:21:10.710]  I appreciate it.
[03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:11.910]  I like it all, actually.
[03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:15.332]  I don't like the evil, but this is one hell of an adventure, man.
[03:21:15.332 --> 03:21:16.553]  Wow, this is quite a timeline.
[03:21:16.553 --> 03:21:18.554]  All right, Jacob, finish up your point.
[03:21:18.554 --> 03:21:19.314]  Sorry to make you hold.
[03:21:19.314 --> 03:21:19.695]  Go ahead.
[03:21:19.695 --> 03:21:21.375]  We love you.
[03:21:21.375 --> 03:21:22.116]  Yeah, we love you.
[03:21:22.116 --> 03:21:24.017]  I love you, too, Alex.
[03:21:24.017 --> 03:21:25.498]  Yeah, so I'm Armenian.
[03:21:26.391 --> 03:21:34.494]  And you know, we've been through the genocide, so before I even found you, I already knew about tyranny and authoritarianism.
[03:21:34.494 --> 03:21:36.274]  Say that again, where were you from?
[03:21:36.274 --> 03:21:37.615]  Armenia.
[03:21:37.615 --> 03:21:39.315]  Oh my God, it's the Armenian Genocide.
[03:21:39.315 --> 03:21:41.716]  A million and a half people killed by the Young Turks.
[03:21:42.489 --> 03:21:45.330]  Which the ADL, by the way, denied the Armenian Genocide until 2016.
[03:21:45.330 --> 03:21:47.631]  Because that's Christians getting killed.
[03:21:47.631 --> 03:21:48.291]  They denied it.
[03:21:48.291 --> 03:21:50.771]  So people have called me a liar for that.
[03:21:50.771 --> 03:21:52.612]  Your people could find that in a second.
[03:21:52.612 --> 03:21:54.072]  No, I remember they called you a liar.
[03:21:54.072 --> 03:21:56.393]  Yeah, they said, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:21:56.393 --> 03:21:58.014]  I said, no, here's the article.
[03:21:58.014 --> 03:21:58.594]  AP.
[03:21:58.594 --> 03:21:59.414]  Yeah, here's the article.
[03:21:59.414 --> 03:22:00.954]  They denied it until 2016.
[03:22:00.954 --> 03:22:03.175]  Until they couldn't deny it anymore.
[03:22:03.175 --> 03:22:05.956]  So that goes to show that when Christians are genocided,
[03:22:06.954 --> 03:22:08.395]  Who cares, right?
[03:22:08.395 --> 03:22:10.356]  That's the answer from the left.
[03:22:10.356 --> 03:22:14.459]  Exactly, so you're saying you're Armenian, you understand, but please continue.
[03:22:14.459 --> 03:22:20.964]  Yeah, so I see the authoritarianism and I feel like it's like a 21st century technocratic version of that.
[03:22:20.964 --> 03:22:27.448]  And I tell my Armenian friends and they think all this is far-fetched information.
[03:22:28.098 --> 03:22:29.258]  And I try to wake them up.
[03:22:29.258 --> 03:22:34.139]  You know, a lot of them, I woke up a lot of people, but there's just some people I just can't get.
[03:22:34.139 --> 03:22:40.440]  Wow, so even though they're great-grandparents, it happened to them, and they're grandparents, they won't believe it.
[03:22:40.440 --> 03:22:41.260]  Exactly.
[03:22:41.260 --> 03:22:43.681]  And that's what shocks me about it.
[03:22:43.681 --> 03:22:45.101]  Jacob, we love you and appreciate the call.
[03:22:45.101 --> 03:22:47.701]  God bless you.
[03:22:47.701 --> 03:22:48.642]  Cernovich, you want to comment on that?
[03:22:48.642 --> 03:22:49.322]  We'll take more calls.
[03:22:49.322 --> 03:22:52.242]  Well, that goes to, again, the negativity, because Arminian's a very Christian.
[03:22:52.242 --> 03:22:54.883]  That goes to the negativity of the Christian.
[03:22:54.883 --> 03:22:56.103]  That's why it's our role
[03:22:57.028 --> 03:23:00.650]  To tell Christians flipping naive, right?
[03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:01.730]  Well, why can't it happen here?
[03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:02.811]  Why can't it happen again?
[03:23:02.811 --> 03:23:07.854]  When left-wing organizations, including Barack Obama, denied the Armenian Genocide too, right?
[03:23:07.854 --> 03:23:08.894]  This is objectively true.
[03:23:08.894 --> 03:23:12.276]  And by the way, the Turks bragged in the news they were doing it at the time.
[03:23:12.276 --> 03:23:14.117]  It's not a debatable deal.
[03:23:14.117 --> 03:23:17.558]  It's not debatable whether it happened, but it was denied by left-wing groups.
[03:23:17.558 --> 03:23:19.039]  Well, exactly!
[03:23:19.039 --> 03:23:20.800]  But they deny everything.
[03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:23.061]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Florida.
[03:23:23.061 --> 03:23:23.822]  Alex, thanks for holding.
[03:23:23.822 --> 03:23:24.122]  Go ahead.
[03:23:25.566 --> 03:23:28.167]  Hey, thank you for having me on the show, guys.
[03:23:28.167 --> 03:23:30.449]  I want to first start by saying I agree with both of you.
[03:23:30.449 --> 03:23:34.011]  We should have never got to here, but thank goodness that he was found not guilty.
[03:23:34.011 --> 03:23:37.032]  I definitely consider that a victory.
[03:23:37.032 --> 03:23:38.493]  And I know it's kind of old news.
[03:23:38.493 --> 03:23:41.475]  I kind of wanted to bring it back to the Travis Scott concert.
[03:23:41.475 --> 03:23:55.002]  My girlfriend and I, we were talking about it and we've done research, and we think that somehow, some way, a frequency was sent out or the music may have triggered adverse reactions in all of those hundreds of people if they were vaccinated.
[03:23:55.720 --> 03:23:59.985]  I don't know if the artists were conscious, but the forces behind it absolutely did a mass ritual in my view, Mike.
[03:24:18.628 --> 03:24:20.952]  Yeah, I don't think it was a vaccine at all.
[03:24:20.952 --> 03:24:26.599]  What the issue that people have to worry about is music does create certain vibrations.
[03:24:26.599 --> 03:24:27.340]  There are binaural beats.
[03:24:27.340 --> 03:24:29.423]  This has all been studied scientifically.
[03:24:29.423 --> 03:24:35.330]  People have to be careful when you get in with a group of people who become collectively under hypnosis.
[03:24:35.931 --> 03:24:36.131]  Right?
[03:24:36.131 --> 03:24:36.851]  That's what music does.
[03:24:36.851 --> 03:24:37.571]  Because there's a sixth sense.
[03:24:37.571 --> 03:24:38.451]  There's a broadcast.
[03:24:38.451 --> 03:24:41.592]  That's why people can sync up in a war or in a church.
[03:24:41.592 --> 03:24:42.752]  We sync up.
[03:24:42.752 --> 03:24:44.292]  You sync up.
[03:24:44.292 --> 03:24:44.873]  You sync up.
[03:24:44.873 --> 03:24:45.113]  Yeah.
[03:24:45.113 --> 03:24:47.313]  They would play drums in the Revolutionary War.
[03:24:47.313 --> 03:24:49.073]  People are not mindful of that.
[03:24:49.073 --> 03:24:51.034]  When you're listening to music, you're in a hypnotic state.
[03:24:51.034 --> 03:24:58.295]  So for me, I don't listen to... I used to listen to a certain kind of death metal, a certain kind of rap.
[03:24:58.295 --> 03:24:58.675]  Me too.
[03:24:58.675 --> 03:25:02.936]  I can't listen to any of it now because even though it puts you in that state.
[03:25:02.936 --> 03:25:03.816]  And exactly, a drum...
[03:25:05.736 --> 03:25:06.837]  It's you ready for death.
[03:25:06.837 --> 03:25:14.463]  Right, so you're hypnotizing yourself, and now you're in a group of people who have collectively hypnotized themselves, and then they can be led astray.
[03:25:14.463 --> 03:25:19.006]  Let's be clear, it's part of what we did to win wars, but that's how old mind control is.
[03:25:19.006 --> 03:25:26.331]  Marching armies with a drum, all as one, and people are being killed right next to you, but you don't care because of that simple mind control.
[03:25:26.331 --> 03:25:28.192]  Imagine what they can do at a concert with all that.
[03:25:28.192 --> 03:25:28.933]  Mike, that's a great point.
[03:25:29.093 --> 03:25:30.073]  Yeah, music is hypnotic.
[03:25:30.073 --> 03:25:32.914]  That's why I tell people, you have to be mindful of what you listen to.
[03:25:32.914 --> 03:25:38.717]  And I used to listen to all that stuff, but I only want to listen to music now about love, opening up my soul.
[03:25:38.717 --> 03:25:46.879]  And then when I do listen to music that has a chant element to it, like Sansatia or something, I know what it's doing though.
[03:25:46.879 --> 03:25:49.380]  I know that, okay, this music is hypnotic in a way.
[03:25:49.380 --> 03:25:50.801]  But then you can direct it where you want.
[03:25:51.361 --> 03:25:52.461]  You use the controller.
[03:25:52.461 --> 03:25:58.323]  So I listen to a lot of really deep spiritual music with drums, but is that where I'm passively receiving it?
[03:25:58.323 --> 03:25:59.084]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:25:59.084 --> 03:25:59.804]  Yeah.
[03:25:59.804 --> 03:26:01.624]  And Alex, finish your point.
[03:26:01.624 --> 03:26:02.164]  I got a question.
[03:26:02.164 --> 03:26:03.805]  Go ahead.
[03:26:03.805 --> 03:26:10.727]  Well, yeah, I just brought it up because, you know, all the heart attacks and with everything we know about the vaccine, I thought maybe the music may trigger something with the graphene.
[03:26:10.727 --> 03:26:12.968]  But the last thing... No, no, I think it might have, but go ahead.
[03:26:14.057 --> 03:26:17.921]  Last thing I wanted to say is definitely wanted to plug the storable food.
[03:26:17.921 --> 03:26:18.762]  I love it.
[03:26:18.762 --> 03:26:19.342]  I eat it.
[03:26:19.342 --> 03:26:20.824]  I have a year's supply of it.
[03:26:20.824 --> 03:26:28.291]  And to quote the Bible, you know, Proverbs, in the house of the wise, there are stores of choice oils and foods, but the fool devours all that he has.
[03:26:28.291 --> 03:26:32.595]  And with these uncertain times, support the InfoWare broadcast and buy some food.
[03:26:33.097 --> 03:26:33.377]  That's right.
[03:26:33.377 --> 03:26:35.100]  We've got really good food at a low price.
[03:26:35.100 --> 03:26:36.462]  You can pay a lot more and get something better.
[03:26:36.462 --> 03:26:38.405]  But for the price you pay, it's good quality food.
[03:26:38.405 --> 03:26:40.187]  It's what I use for my family.
[03:26:40.187 --> 03:26:42.090]  And they definitely want us to pin it on the system.
[03:26:42.090 --> 03:26:43.913]  So yeah, Infowarrestore.com.
[03:26:43.913 --> 03:26:44.854]  And thanks for the plug.
[03:26:44.854 --> 03:26:47.218]  But we're going to go to break in a few minutes and then come back to calls.
[03:26:47.218 --> 03:26:48.019]  But I want to ask this question.
[03:26:49.019 --> 03:26:49.279]  I don't
[03:27:08.596 --> 03:27:10.798]  I don't want to be like a sorcerer that says, well, I can control this.
[03:27:10.798 --> 03:27:17.162]  I don't even listen to a lot of that stuff, because even though I can use that and undoubtedly suck energy right out of the planet.
[03:27:17.162 --> 03:27:19.224]  I mean, I can like, if I need to, just get power.
[03:27:19.224 --> 03:27:21.225]  But I don't even do that.
[03:27:21.225 --> 03:27:23.026]  Something about it, I was like, I don't do that.
[03:27:23.026 --> 03:27:24.467]  When I was younger and stuff, I would do it.
[03:27:24.467 --> 03:27:31.893]  But what is that energy, do you think, where our will could actually energize ourselves out of the, like literally sucking it out of another dimension?
[03:27:32.386 --> 03:27:38.127]  We're all connected energetically to each other in a collective consciousness and we're all connected to the land and the soil.
[03:27:38.127 --> 03:27:44.149]  So what you're doing is working on different vibrational frequencies and feeling and intuiting.
[03:27:44.149 --> 03:27:45.649]  You're a very intuitive person.
[03:27:45.649 --> 03:27:47.690]  You're intuiting the energetic frequency.
[03:27:47.690 --> 03:27:49.690]  So you might not be able to intellectualize it.
[03:27:49.690 --> 03:27:52.491]  You might not be able to... No, I agree, but I don't want to take power from somebody.
[03:27:52.491 --> 03:27:54.171]  Where's that power coming from?
[03:27:54.171 --> 03:27:56.812]  No, the power comes from you when you connect to the divine.
[03:27:56.812 --> 03:27:58.072]  No, I know I'm making connection.
[03:27:58.072 --> 03:27:59.073]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:27:59.073 --> 03:28:00.513]  Where's the power coming from on the other side?
[03:28:01.391 --> 03:28:03.332]  Oh, that's the riddle of existence.
[03:28:03.332 --> 03:28:03.592]  Yeah.
[03:28:03.592 --> 03:28:06.093]  Right?
[03:28:06.093 --> 03:28:11.254]  But then I think, depending on the type of music you're listening to, that's what controls the tuning of it.
[03:28:11.254 --> 03:28:12.675]  Yeah, it's all vibrational.
[03:28:12.675 --> 03:28:18.137]  The source, I mean, the riddle of existence, the source is, how did we get here?
[03:28:18.137 --> 03:28:18.657]  Right?
[03:28:18.657 --> 03:28:19.957]  Who is God?
[03:28:19.957 --> 03:28:20.717]  Where did God come from?
[03:28:20.717 --> 03:28:23.478]  But there's almost, when you do that, you're like, whoa, this is super powerful.
[03:28:23.478 --> 03:28:24.879]  Like, is it even good to dial into that?
[03:28:25.583 --> 03:28:28.625]  Oh, again, that's why it isn't for newbies.
[03:28:28.625 --> 03:28:32.108]  That's why I wouldn't tell a 13-year-old that you should chant.
[03:28:32.108 --> 03:28:34.830]  You shouldn't do a lot of this Kundalini magic.
[03:28:34.830 --> 03:28:37.172]  Maybe you never should.
[03:28:37.172 --> 03:28:49.400]  Some Christians would say you should never do Kundalini, and I respect their point of view, but I know that there are ways to tap into your own guided experiences with a lot of these, I call them technologies more than magic.
[03:28:49.400 --> 03:28:51.662]  Hold on, magic's the old term for technology.
[03:28:51.662 --> 03:28:53.063]  Yeah, technology's magic.
[03:28:53.063 --> 03:28:53.884]  Balls are straight ahead.
[03:28:55.267 --> 03:28:57.469]  You know, listen, I know you're humble.
[03:28:57.469 --> 03:29:12.019]  I know you're like me, but I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[03:29:12.019 --> 03:29:14.341]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[03:29:18.049 --> 03:29:25.416]  When it begins to dawn, it is more important than ever that you realize how important you are, that you be more active than you've ever been.
[03:29:25.416 --> 03:29:27.638]  The tip of the spear is Van Dot Millionaire.
[03:29:27.638 --> 03:29:30.940]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is M4Wars.com.
[03:29:31.801 --> 03:29:36.444]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[03:29:36.444 --> 03:29:41.287]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air at SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:29:41.287 --> 03:29:42.807]  That's SaveM4Wars.com.
[03:29:42.807 --> 03:29:57.596]  And continue to go to M4WarsStore.com, where right now, we've got Turbo Force, sold out for months, 10 hours of energy, back and stock with free shipping, 40% off, and so many other great products.
[03:29:57.596 --> 03:29:59.157]  What are champions made of?
[03:30:01.014 --> 03:30:02.141]  Here's a man who can show you.
[03:30:08.709 --> 03:30:10.250]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:30:10.250 --> 03:30:11.790]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:13.151]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:30:13.151 --> 03:30:14.652]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!
[03:30:14.652 --> 03:30:15.912]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:30:15.912 --> 03:30:17.233]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[03:30:34.921 --> 03:30:38.362]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[03:30:38.362 --> 03:30:41.702]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[03:30:41.702 --> 03:30:43.643]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore outline.
[03:30:43.643 --> 03:30:45.463]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:45.463 --> 03:30:49.864]  I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours, and I'm looking at mainstream news.
[03:31:03.786 --> 03:31:18.532]  Reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[03:31:19.787 --> 03:31:24.730]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[03:31:24.730 --> 03:31:26.492]  It's not on the national news.
[03:31:26.492 --> 03:31:28.893]  And it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[03:31:28.893 --> 03:31:29.874]  It's just crazy.
[03:31:29.874 --> 03:31:35.277]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[03:31:35.277 --> 03:31:36.678]  It doesn't hurt anybody.
[03:31:36.678 --> 03:31:38.960]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you say it.
[03:31:38.960 --> 03:31:40.341]  It's just crazy.
[03:31:40.341 --> 03:31:45.244]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[03:31:45.244 --> 03:31:48.246]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[03:31:48.246 --> 03:31:49.647]  That's why Infowars is on air.
[03:31:49.907 --> 03:31:53.250]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[03:31:53.250 --> 03:31:54.251]  This is just insane.
[03:31:54.251 --> 03:31:55.632]  These people are killers.
[03:31:55.632 --> 03:32:02.879]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[03:32:02.879 --> 03:32:08.824]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[03:32:08.824 --> 03:32:10.226]  Horrible crashes and
[03:32:11.761 --> 03:32:14.044]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[03:32:14.044 --> 03:32:26.140]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at mfoilworkstore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[03:32:26.140 --> 03:32:29.144]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[03:32:30.137 --> 03:32:38.805]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:38.805 --> 03:32:42.248]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[03:32:42.248 --> 03:32:45.131]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[03:32:45.131 --> 03:32:50.115]  It is 10 hours of clean energy.
[03:32:50.115 --> 03:32:52.437]  Clean energy without the big crash.
[03:32:52.437 --> 03:32:54.679]  It's available right now and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[03:32:58.815 --> 03:33:18.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.708 --> 03:33:23.712]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.602 --> 03:33:32.665]  All right, let's get to these callers that have been holding it really, really patiently and bringing up amazing points.
[03:33:32.665 --> 03:33:36.027]  Let's talk to Steve in Utah, then Steve in Nevada.
[03:33:36.027 --> 03:33:37.107]  Steve, thank you so much.
[03:33:37.107 --> 03:33:40.929]  You're on the air with Mike Cernovich on a very historic day.
[03:33:40.929 --> 03:33:44.031]  And we might be getting call written house on today, Saturday, or Sunday.
[03:33:44.031 --> 03:33:45.452]  Just leave it at that.
[03:33:45.452 --> 03:33:46.312]  His mom's been on.
[03:33:46.312 --> 03:33:47.293]  We've talked to Kyle before.
[03:33:47.293 --> 03:33:49.694]  They promised they'd come on if he was found not guilty.
[03:33:49.694 --> 03:33:52.776]  So we think they're the type of folks who will keep their promise, so look for that.
[03:33:52.776 --> 03:33:54.417]  But let's go back to the phone call.
[03:33:54.417 --> 03:33:55.718]  Steve in Utah, go ahead.
[03:33:56.889 --> 03:33:58.170]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:33:58.170 --> 03:34:04.133]  Man, I'm glad that he was found not guilty, but like Mike Cernovich said, this should never have happened.
[03:34:04.133 --> 03:34:05.013]  Yeah, of course.
[03:34:05.013 --> 03:34:15.599]  I just want to speak on the fact that we in life, as we, you know, go up throughout the day, we interact with demonic people and we just don't even know it.
[03:34:15.599 --> 03:34:16.699]  We don't even realize it.
[03:34:16.699 --> 03:34:25.984]  You can't see it until, you know, there's some kind of catalyst or activation of the demonicness of, you know, whether it's violence
[03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:27.493]  I don't know.
[03:34:56.438 --> 03:35:12.810]  What's going to happen is, you know, we don't understand, we don't have a grasp of what's really going on, but one day something's going to happen, and on the other hand, we are all going to activate, we are all going to, you know, as in concert, everyone
[03:35:15.313 --> 03:35:15.533]  Yes.
[03:35:30.806 --> 03:35:32.687]  An awakening, I would, you know...
[03:35:47.366 --> 03:35:48.187]  What would I call it?
[03:35:48.187 --> 03:35:52.869]  The zeitgeist of the moment would be the final... We're entering the final stand.
[03:35:52.869 --> 03:35:56.192]  The Rittenhouse barely... That's what you have to look at.
[03:35:56.192 --> 03:35:58.713]  Not just that he won, but he barely won.
[03:35:58.713 --> 03:36:02.896]  He only won because a few brave live streamers were there and they got that footage.
[03:36:02.896 --> 03:36:04.357]  Otherwise, it would have been Dr. Abbas.
[03:36:05.117 --> 03:36:06.178]  Yeah, Drew Hernandez.
[03:36:06.178 --> 03:36:08.579]  The FBI, they covered up the video.
[03:36:08.579 --> 03:36:11.641]  They had video clearing Kyle Rittenhouse of all crimes.
[03:36:11.641 --> 03:36:19.165]  So we now know the FBI is spying on everybody, but they're only going to use it to frame people and try to get innocent people convicted.
[03:36:19.165 --> 03:36:22.626]  Think about how you're an agency and a group of people together.
[03:36:22.626 --> 03:36:23.927]  Like, my crew's great people.
[03:36:23.927 --> 03:36:25.968]  If I tried to frame somebody, they'd all turn against me.
[03:36:25.968 --> 03:36:27.069]  I wouldn't do it anyways.
[03:36:27.069 --> 03:36:29.310]  Imagine a group where you just do this all day long.
[03:36:29.310 --> 03:36:30.691]  Yeah, where are the FBI whistleblowers?
[03:36:31.753 --> 03:36:37.194]  Kyle Rittenhouse's persecution was the Alamo, except they didn't kill him.
[03:36:37.554 --> 03:36:38.715]  But that's what they wanted.
[03:36:38.715 --> 03:36:39.835]  They were trying to kill him.
[03:36:39.835 --> 03:36:43.277]  So in a way, it was almost like the last day of the Alamo.
[03:36:43.277 --> 03:36:53.381]  So people have to, who are patriotic, have to feel, it gets energized, also recognizing that what they really tried to do to this kid, they tried to break his immortal soul.
[03:36:53.381 --> 03:36:56.223]  And by the way, they're already on Twitter making fun of him collapsing.
[03:36:56.223 --> 03:36:57.383]  Imagine life in prison.
[03:36:57.383 --> 03:37:00.305]  You've already been in jail for six months in the first year.
[03:37:00.305 --> 03:37:03.546]  And then now you're not going to be in prison for life when you're getting death threats all day.
[03:37:03.546 --> 03:37:05.247]  Yeah, I think anybody might collapse.
[03:37:05.407 --> 03:37:06.588]  It's good that they're doing that though.
[03:37:06.588 --> 03:37:17.080]  That's what we've been talking about is evil doesn't know when to stop and it's good that they're siding with a convicted serial child rapist.
[03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:21.545]  It's good that they're mocking Kyle Rittenhouse for showing humanity.
[03:37:21.545 --> 03:37:22.526]  We want them to do that.
[03:37:22.526 --> 03:37:25.008]  As Napoleon said, never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.
[03:37:25.749 --> 03:37:30.876]  What I'm looking at online and what I'm seeing from the left is beautiful.
[03:37:30.876 --> 03:37:31.556]  Give me more.
[03:37:31.556 --> 03:37:31.997]  Give me more.
[03:37:31.997 --> 03:37:32.658]  Do more.
[03:37:32.658 --> 03:37:34.300]  Defend more of the indefensible.
[03:37:34.300 --> 03:37:35.722]  It's hard to believe.
[03:37:35.722 --> 03:37:37.264]  They're such villains.
[03:37:37.264 --> 03:37:38.926]  Maybe this is a simulation.
[03:37:38.926 --> 03:37:40.948]  These people are ridiculously bad.
[03:37:40.948 --> 03:37:42.831]  But they don't have plausible deniability anymore.
[03:37:43.251 --> 03:37:44.372]  We want them to come out.
[03:37:44.372 --> 03:37:45.753]  We want moral clarity.
[03:37:45.753 --> 03:37:51.517]  My mantra, the way I define our age, is we live in the age of moral clarity.
[03:37:51.517 --> 03:37:54.340]  You can no longer say, well, there's some good apples.
[03:37:54.340 --> 03:37:57.182]  The FBI, there's just a few bad apples, but the line agents are good guys.
[03:37:57.182 --> 03:38:03.226]  Oh, they're like, oh, this vaccine erases your immune system, makes you get sicker, but you're going to take more.
[03:38:03.226 --> 03:38:05.588]  They admit it and then try to make you do it.
[03:38:05.588 --> 03:38:06.289]  It's total clarity.
[03:38:06.289 --> 03:38:07.770]  You're right.
[03:38:07.770 --> 03:38:08.851]  Steve, finish your point.
[03:38:08.851 --> 03:38:09.111]  Go ahead.
[03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:22.345]  Um, I just think they're, they're just oblivious to, they just don't have the, how do I explain it, they don't have the subtleties of just, they don't get it, you know what I mean?
[03:38:22.345 --> 03:38:23.665]  They're in their own world.
[03:38:23.665 --> 03:38:36.210]  They just act on it and, and it doesn't, oh, I don't, I don't know if there's no consequence or what, it's just, it's just they, they don't, they're oblivious to just how wicked
[03:38:36.914 --> 03:38:38.036]  Their actions are in it.
[03:38:38.036 --> 03:38:38.817]  They're not oblivious.
[03:38:38.817 --> 03:38:39.678]  No, they know.
[03:38:39.678 --> 03:38:40.639]  Thanks for the call, Steve.
[03:38:40.639 --> 03:38:43.843]  Yeah, the call is great and you brought up some good conversational points.
[03:38:43.843 --> 03:38:46.186]  We live in the age of moral clarity.
[03:38:47.442 --> 03:38:48.583]  They know what they do.
[03:38:48.583 --> 03:38:53.507]  It isn't like when Christ has been crucified and he said, forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.
[03:38:53.507 --> 03:38:54.087]  They know!
[03:38:54.087 --> 03:38:55.708]  The end is about it all being clear.
[03:38:55.708 --> 03:38:56.809]  They know what they did.
[03:38:56.809 --> 03:39:01.793]  I told you, the end is about everything becoming clear, so you make the right decision or make the wrong decision.
[03:39:01.793 --> 03:39:05.896]  And General Flynn, last Saturday, did a big powerful interview with him that just went live a few days ago.
[03:39:05.896 --> 03:39:09.698]  And he said, listen, courage is a decision, but also serving evil is a decision.
[03:39:09.698 --> 03:39:10.279]  It's a decision.
[03:39:10.919 --> 03:39:14.503]  Right, so we live in a beautiful time because you are choosing.
[03:39:14.503 --> 03:39:15.544]  You can't claim you didn't know.
[03:39:15.544 --> 03:39:18.987]  Why would you make a decision to be for raping children?
[03:39:18.987 --> 03:39:22.271]  I mean, I have no desire to do it anyways, but like, why would you do that?
[03:39:22.271 --> 03:39:24.893]  That's the problem with moral people, is moral people try to...
[03:39:27.310 --> 03:39:38.154]  Use their own morality to filter through the decision-making process of the people, whereas when you take the real enlightened pill and the higher consciousness, you realize they do it because they serve evil.
[03:39:38.154 --> 03:39:42.216]  So we can't project our morality onto them, or we'll never understand them.
[03:39:42.216 --> 03:39:53.120]  The only way to understand them is to say that they live in a different morality, they don't have morality, this is how they think, they're evil, the end.
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:39:54.520]  Take out the trash, absolutely.
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:39:56.341]  Steven D'Amato, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[03:39:57.725 --> 03:39:58.666]  How's it going, guys?
[03:39:58.666 --> 03:39:59.106]  Good, brother.
[03:39:59.106 --> 03:40:00.407]  Thanks for holding.
[03:40:00.407 --> 03:40:03.650]  Yeah, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones on the line at the same time.
[03:40:03.650 --> 03:40:05.011]  It's unbelievable.
[03:40:05.011 --> 03:40:09.214]  Anyway, I'm a longtime listener of both of you guys.
[03:40:09.214 --> 03:40:14.678]  And, you know, I live out here in Nevada, Southern Nevada, right outside of Las Vegas.
[03:40:14.678 --> 03:40:17.400]  I'm a small business owner and a musician.
[03:40:17.400 --> 03:40:23.945]  And I'm really disgusted to see how the country has responded to this pandemic.
[03:40:23.945 --> 03:40:25.727]  I'm glad to see that Kyle Rittenhouse,
[03:40:26.792 --> 03:40:28.894]  Was found not guilty.
[03:40:28.894 --> 03:40:34.240]  But that's just the start of what's coming with this takedown.
[03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:41.588]  And you know, I really I don't see where the country is fighting back against this.
[03:40:41.588 --> 03:40:43.110]  It's strong enough.
[03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:44.191]  I mean, what's your take on that?
[03:40:45.242 --> 03:40:47.106]  I agree, Mike.
[03:40:47.106 --> 03:40:50.312]  I think, more than ever, people are waking up and taking a stand.
[03:40:50.312 --> 03:40:52.697]  Look what's happening with the school board elections.
[03:40:52.697 --> 03:40:56.664]  Gunkin is a typical... Sure, I get it, but under this level of assault, it should be even more.
[03:40:58.232 --> 03:40:59.513]  We have to meet people where they are.
[03:40:59.513 --> 03:41:01.375]  But before it's bigger, it's going to have to get bigger.
[03:41:01.375 --> 03:41:05.979]  You have to, you have to, again, we talked about this yesterday with the God timeline, the timelines we're on.
[03:41:05.979 --> 03:41:09.081]  We have to look at what happened and what was good.
[03:41:09.081 --> 03:41:15.587]  And what was good is you had brave, patriotic Americans doing real journalism on the front lines, risking their own lives.
[03:41:15.587 --> 03:41:17.248]  Hugh Hernandez could have been killed.
[03:41:17.248 --> 03:41:18.629]  Julio Ross could have been killed.
[03:41:18.629 --> 03:41:20.691]  And an attempt to suppress that truth.
[03:41:20.811 --> 03:41:22.612]  Elijah Schaffer, they could have been killed.
[03:41:22.612 --> 03:41:27.877]  So what I feel like, um, you know, people like this caller, I don't mean to, to indict your character at all.
[03:41:27.877 --> 03:41:31.479]  I just say that we need to focus on the people who are on the front lines.
[03:41:31.479 --> 03:41:33.461]  Are we giving them the support that they need?
[03:41:33.461 --> 03:41:34.902]  I don't need the support.
[03:41:34.902 --> 03:41:39.906]  I, but the people like Elijah Schaffer, who was there, Drew Hernandez was there, Julio Ross was there.
[03:41:39.906 --> 03:41:46.451]  There was that other, uh, I forget his name, but he was that white kid who Binger said, well, why did you think it was a riot?
[03:41:46.451 --> 03:41:48.493]  And he said, well, by the way, I know most of those people.
[03:41:49.153 --> 03:41:50.034]  They don't make a big deal about it.
[03:41:50.034 --> 03:41:51.975]  Behind the scenes, they get doxxed.
[03:41:51.975 --> 03:41:52.755]  People come to their house.
[03:41:52.755 --> 03:41:56.557]  They're death-threatening them all right now because they dare to go out and show the truth.
[03:41:56.557 --> 03:41:59.498]  Yeah, they saved Kyle Rittenhouse's life.
[03:41:59.498 --> 03:42:01.079]  You're right.
[03:42:01.079 --> 03:42:05.582]  Drew Hernandez and Elijah Schaefer, they saved his life.
[03:42:05.582 --> 03:42:07.462]  And then that other guy, I can't remember.
[03:42:07.462 --> 03:42:12.205]  He's a really good-looking young white guy, probably in his mid-twenties.
[03:42:12.205 --> 03:42:13.326]  I forget his name, but anyway.
[03:42:13.326 --> 03:42:16.027]  He's got like a Northern European name.
[03:42:16.027 --> 03:42:17.348]  He's very Chad-looking.
[03:42:18.268 --> 03:42:20.109]  That's where we need to focus on, right?
[03:42:20.109 --> 03:42:21.610]  Henson?
[03:42:21.610 --> 03:42:28.014]  No, they could find the clip because Binger said, well, why did you... He said, because I'm about to effing kill you or whatever.
[03:42:28.014 --> 03:42:33.918]  Binger was trying to make it look like he was misrepresenting the video, and then he owned Binger and it went viral.
[03:42:33.918 --> 03:42:35.139]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[03:42:35.139 --> 03:42:36.440]  Alright, thank you Steve.
[03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:38.641]  Alright, we're gonna jam in some more calls here on the other side.
[03:42:38.641 --> 03:42:40.362]  That's where people need to focus on, is...
[03:42:42.295 --> 03:42:44.637]  Too much of this, the system that, the system that.
[03:42:44.637 --> 03:42:46.518]  Who's doing good work?
[03:42:46.518 --> 03:42:50.021]  And are you amplifying and supporting the people?
[03:42:50.021 --> 03:42:50.621]  No, that's really it.
[03:42:50.621 --> 03:42:52.162]  We should support the tip of the spear.
[03:42:52.162 --> 03:42:52.683]  We'll be right back.

[03:44:12.572 --> 03:44:13.172]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[03:44:13.172 --> 03:44:14.553]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:44:14.553 --> 03:44:16.434]  Can I plug, uh, Alex real quick?
[03:44:16.434 --> 03:44:16.874]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:44:16.874 --> 03:44:24.279]  Hey, I'm in my 60s, uh, and I do the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I work them into the ground, and you wanna know why?
[03:44:24.279 --> 03:44:30.223]  And I've tested this, and I've taken your B-12, and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[03:44:30.223 --> 03:44:31.323]  I really do.
[03:44:31.323 --> 03:44:33.865]  I take that B-12, and I am electric, man.
[03:44:34.225 --> 03:44:35.266]  I can run 10 miles.
[03:44:35.266 --> 03:44:47.498]  I do some pretty heavy work with the highway department, and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[03:44:47.498 --> 03:44:49.260]  The B-12 saves my life.
[03:44:57.216 --> 03:45:04.466]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products, energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[03:45:04.466 --> 03:45:10.394]  And look, almost all of them work, but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[03:45:10.394 --> 03:45:11.816]  Horrible crashes and
[03:45:13.348 --> 03:45:15.629]  Again, so many toxins in them.
[03:45:15.629 --> 03:45:27.716]  All of the nootropic products that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality, and they're long-lasting, and they help focus your mind.
[03:45:27.716 --> 03:45:30.698]  And right now, our strongest product, the three nootropics we have,
[03:45:31.724 --> 03:45:40.387]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce are back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:45:40.387 --> 03:45:43.828]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.

[03:45:46.709 --> 03:45:56.253]  It is 10 hours of clean energy, clean energy without the big crash, and it's available right now, and it funds the InfoWare 360 win.
[03:45:59.741 --> 03:46:01.823]  Your voice counts.
[03:46:01.823 --> 03:46:06.887]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[03:46:06.887 --> 03:46:09.469]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:10.970]  They know you're angry.
[03:46:10.970 --> 03:46:15.794]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[03:46:51.961 --> 03:46:53.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:18.582]  You know, Mike Cernovich doesn't want the story told on there, but I'm just going to violate his confidence and do it.
[03:47:18.582 --> 03:47:20.683]  Alex Jones Show here, final segment, War Room.
[03:47:20.683 --> 03:47:22.084]  I'm sure it's about to take place.
[03:47:22.084 --> 03:47:22.944]  I'm going to be on the show.
[03:47:22.944 --> 03:47:25.445]  Mike's probably going to be on a bunch of others, 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:47:25.445 --> 03:47:26.365]  Central.
[03:47:26.365 --> 03:47:27.986]  But I said, hey, let me fly you out here.
[03:47:27.986 --> 03:47:28.906]  Let me pay for your hotel.
[03:47:28.906 --> 03:47:30.727]  Let me, he goes, I don't really need it.
[03:47:30.727 --> 03:47:31.727]  Maybe give me a check if you want.
[03:47:31.727 --> 03:47:32.768]  Now he goes, just give that check.
[03:47:33.288 --> 03:47:36.052]  To the Rittenhouse Defense Fund, because you know they're going to sue him.
[03:47:36.052 --> 03:47:39.077]  You know they're going to try to have the Justice Department indict him.
[03:47:39.077 --> 03:47:44.967]  But I think Biden coming out and trying to back off kind of signifies they know this is a losing battle they're in, Mike.
[03:47:45.865 --> 03:47:48.367]  Yeah, I'm I didn't want I don't want your money.
[03:47:48.367 --> 03:47:49.489]  I don't want anybody's money.
[03:47:49.489 --> 03:47:55.915]  I don't I want people who are really because I'm not at the tip of the spear anymore.
[03:47:55.915 --> 03:48:01.420]  I'm I had to withdraw a little bit retreat just like many people do and that's something you haven't done yet.
[03:48:01.420 --> 03:48:03.722]  And I think that you need to do anyway, you read these great.
[03:48:04.423 --> 03:48:05.243]  We're good to go.
[03:48:28.695 --> 03:48:34.199]  So for me, I just want people who are on the front lines to be supported by people.
[03:48:34.199 --> 03:48:35.299]  I don't want anything from anybody.
[03:48:35.299 --> 03:48:39.362]  You know, I crowdfunded Hoax and I was grateful for the support I had.
[03:48:39.362 --> 03:48:42.084]  I did Hoax, but I want people supporting you.
[03:48:42.084 --> 03:48:48.608]  I want people supporting all of the independent streamers who saved Kyle Rittenhouse's life from the lynch mob.
[03:48:48.608 --> 03:48:51.430]  Oh, the power of independent streamers is so important.
[03:48:51.943 --> 03:49:01.453]  We have to talk about them more because when people call in, I feel like shaking them by the collar and saying... You need to become an independent streamer because you haven't been banned yet.
[03:49:01.453 --> 03:49:03.815]  So maybe you go a six months, a year, five years.
[03:49:03.815 --> 03:49:04.877]  Go to events, stream them.
[03:49:04.877 --> 03:49:06.438]  Don't even say who you are politically.
[03:49:06.438 --> 03:49:08.981]  Just having a real record of what's there defeats the enemy.
[03:49:09.301 --> 03:49:12.804]  I want you all with body cams every time there's an event.
[03:49:12.804 --> 03:49:16.247]  Body cam footage, hidden camera footage, every school board meeting.
[03:49:16.247 --> 03:49:18.989]  I want you to save a life.
[03:49:18.989 --> 03:49:20.771]  The way you save a life is with this.
[03:49:20.771 --> 03:49:24.614]  This is the way, this is Kyle Rittenhouse's life was saved with this.
[03:49:24.614 --> 03:49:26.916]  This is what I want people doing.
[03:49:26.916 --> 03:49:29.358]  The cell phone camera is mightier than the sword.
[03:49:29.358 --> 03:49:31.600]  Oh, the system is, we know the system is corrupt.
[03:49:31.880 --> 03:49:33.241]  Right, you're not doing it.
[03:49:33.241 --> 03:49:36.344]  So it's like not having a court transcript that can lie about you.
[03:49:36.344 --> 03:49:38.967]  The key here is having video of everything.
[03:49:38.967 --> 03:49:45.453]  We're not Big Brother to rail people their houses, but in public events, we need to document their crimes because the left is misbehaving.
[03:49:45.453 --> 03:49:46.414]  We need to expose it.
[03:49:46.414 --> 03:49:47.155]  I agree.
[03:49:47.155 --> 03:49:54.542]  The number one thing is more independent streamers out there with Drew Hernandez and what Elijah Schaefer and what all these people are doing.
[03:49:54.542 --> 03:49:55.123]  That is key.
[03:49:55.626 --> 03:49:57.007]  Yeah, they're there on the front lines.
[03:49:57.007 --> 03:49:58.507]  They're the ones embedded.
[03:49:58.507 --> 03:50:00.808]  Amber Attlee, she was threatened with death.
[03:50:00.808 --> 03:50:01.969]  They threatened to kill women.
[03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:03.829]  Julio Ross has been threatened with death.
[03:50:03.829 --> 03:50:04.730]  He was a Marine, I believe.
[03:50:04.730 --> 03:50:08.871]  They tried to kill all these guys.
[03:50:08.871 --> 03:50:19.836]  I want our people, if I had a magic wand and I could just wave the wand, I want all our people to just knock off the crap about the system.
[03:50:19.836 --> 03:50:22.697]  Are you wearing a camera to school board meetings?
[03:50:23.237 --> 03:50:25.258]  Are you posting it?
[03:50:25.258 --> 03:50:25.578]  Yeah.
[03:50:25.578 --> 03:50:26.879]  Because it's all an info war.
[03:50:26.879 --> 03:50:31.761]  Because they can suppress you, suppress me all day long, but it's you, the average people, that are everything.
[03:50:31.761 --> 03:50:36.243]  That's why we say, you're the info war, you're the victory, you're the answer, you're the resistance.
[03:50:36.243 --> 03:50:37.624]  Yeah, get your footage.
[03:50:37.624 --> 03:50:39.565]  The footage can get to the right people.
[03:50:39.565 --> 03:50:41.305]  It can get out where it needs to get.
[03:50:41.305 --> 03:50:44.467]  Video is how you save lives at this point in your life.
[03:50:44.467 --> 03:50:47.528]  The camera, the iPhone camera's mightier than the sword, especially at this point.
[03:50:47.528 --> 03:50:48.809]  That's what saved his life.
[03:50:48.809 --> 03:50:50.950]  So that's where I just want people to get out of this.
[03:50:51.690 --> 03:50:57.311]  Garbage mindset of, well, I try to convince my brother about the new world.
[03:50:57.311 --> 03:50:58.052]  Who cares?
[03:50:58.052 --> 03:51:00.452]  Are you taking your camera out there and just recording?
[03:51:00.452 --> 03:51:02.333]  And by the way, don't say anything.
[03:51:02.333 --> 03:51:03.073]  Don't say anything.
[03:51:03.073 --> 03:51:04.253]  That's even more powerful.
[03:51:04.253 --> 03:51:04.453]  Right.
[03:51:04.453 --> 03:51:05.693]  Because there's such liars.
[03:51:05.693 --> 03:51:06.554]  You'll catch them every time.
[03:51:06.554 --> 03:51:08.614]  Brad in Pennsylvania.
[03:51:08.614 --> 03:51:08.994]  Welcome.
[03:51:08.994 --> 03:51:10.395]  Go ahead.
[03:51:10.395 --> 03:51:11.615]  Thanks, Alex and Mike.
[03:51:11.615 --> 03:51:12.395]  Appreciate it.
[03:51:12.395 --> 03:51:14.236]  And great discussion.
[03:51:14.236 --> 03:51:15.416]  I'm just like you, Alex.
[03:51:15.416 --> 03:51:17.996]  I was so pumped to hear him, hear Kyle.
[03:51:17.996 --> 03:51:18.677]  We'll come back to you.
[03:51:20.444 --> 03:51:21.805]  He's quiet.
[03:51:21.805 --> 03:51:24.245]  I think your headset's breaking up.
[03:51:24.245 --> 03:51:25.706]  Brad, keep going.
[03:51:25.706 --> 03:51:29.668]  Alright, I just want to say I'm so glad Kyle was acquitted.
[03:51:29.668 --> 03:51:35.850]  When he was on the witness stand, that was powerful testimony that he got up there and had the courage to, even though he broke down and cried.
[03:51:35.850 --> 03:51:38.911]  Sorry, Mike's cord came out.
[03:51:38.911 --> 03:51:39.751]  I apologize, brother.
[03:51:39.751 --> 03:51:41.252]  He's getting it in.
[03:51:41.252 --> 03:51:42.572]  Keep making your point, Brad.
[03:51:42.572 --> 03:51:43.613]  Come help him plug his cord in.
[03:51:45.385 --> 03:51:49.968]  So, the fact that he was acquitted was awesome.
[03:51:49.968 --> 03:51:52.009]  He deserved to be acquitted.
[03:51:52.009 --> 03:52:01.174]  The footage, you're right Mike, the video footage was key because even the layman, the people that weren't there, didn't know what happened.
[03:52:01.174 --> 03:52:03.455]  When we could see that he was defending himself,
[03:52:04.295 --> 03:52:05.856]  And he was being chased down.
[03:52:05.856 --> 03:52:08.437]  There's no question.
[03:52:08.437 --> 03:52:18.260]  Whether he should have been there or not is not even a concern to me because he was protecting, like you said Alex, he was there because his dad lived nearby and he was just doing what he thought was right.
[03:52:18.260 --> 03:52:22.962]  He was put in a situation that he couldn't even control after he got there.
[03:52:22.962 --> 03:52:23.362]  Well, exactly.
[03:52:23.362 --> 03:52:27.764]  Why are we supposed to roll over to a giant horde of child molesters running around burning stuff?
[03:52:27.944 --> 03:52:28.405]  Are they there?
[03:52:28.405 --> 03:52:29.506]  Yeah, BG on the scene.
[03:52:29.506 --> 03:52:36.934]  I mean, this is, this really is, these are the heroes of the day, is the lawyers who have the courage to defend these people.
[03:52:36.934 --> 03:52:44.702]  Because a lot of the January 6th defendants couldn't get competent lawyers because you know that if they're a lawyer defending somebody who's... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:52:44.702 --> 03:52:48.366]  In my cases, they've run off and won't let lawyers out on the case.
[03:52:49.585 --> 03:52:49.845]  We're good
[03:53:10.180 --> 03:53:14.442]  Eric Holder, all these left-wing lawyers would represent terrorists.
[03:53:14.442 --> 03:53:15.622]  And you know what I thought at the time?
[03:53:15.622 --> 03:53:17.003]  Because I was naive.
[03:53:17.003 --> 03:53:24.406]  I said, you know what, they just believe in the Constitution and they believe that, I believe this, they believe terrorists have a right to a trial.
[03:53:24.406 --> 03:53:29.828]  But then January 6th happens, Rittenhouse happens, your stuff happens, they're nowhere to be found.
[03:53:29.828 --> 03:53:32.829]  So we now know that the left, the only reason they defended terrorists,
[03:53:33.330 --> 03:53:35.334]  Is it because they believed in due process of law?
[03:53:35.334 --> 03:53:38.622]  Is it because they wanted to free terrorists so they could get more terrorists?
[03:53:38.622 --> 03:53:38.983]  I agree.
[03:53:38.983 --> 03:53:39.764]  Great point, Brad.
[03:53:39.764 --> 03:53:40.165]  Anything else?
[03:53:40.939 --> 03:53:44.100]  Yeah, I just want to say, Alex, you deserve all the defense you can get to.
[03:53:44.100 --> 03:53:46.160]  So SaveInfoWars.com for you.
[03:53:46.160 --> 03:53:49.621]  Because what you do is purport honest news.
[03:53:49.621 --> 03:53:51.241]  I don't care what anyone says.
[03:53:51.241 --> 03:53:55.262]  I've been listening to you for like 15 years now, daily.
[03:53:55.262 --> 03:53:58.003]  And it's just real news, factual news.
[03:53:58.003 --> 03:53:59.623]  You're just a strong patriot.
[03:53:59.623 --> 03:54:00.623]  You're brave.
[03:54:00.623 --> 03:54:03.164]  Your courage is spreading like wildfire.
[03:54:03.164 --> 03:54:03.924]  So keep it up, man.
[03:54:04.164 --> 03:54:05.405]  Well, courage is contagious.
[03:54:05.405 --> 03:54:05.965]  Thank you, Brad.
[03:54:05.965 --> 03:54:08.688]  But I have to have a lot of courage not to fight this evil and let it take over.
[03:54:08.688 --> 03:54:11.530]  But no, I sold my house.
[03:54:11.530 --> 03:54:15.273]  I'm liquidating everything I've got to fund the Infowar.
[03:54:15.273 --> 03:54:17.435]  And I'm not even worried about these fake lawsuits and all this crap.
[03:54:17.435 --> 03:54:22.879]  I just need money to keep battling those out while I run my operation and just move forward.
[03:54:22.879 --> 03:54:24.180]  That's a distraction.
[03:54:24.180 --> 03:54:31.546]  And money is an easy thing for folks to give at SaveInfowars.com so we can focus on the mission of taking on the New World Order.
[03:54:40.139 --> 03:54:44.842]  I just had a question about the timing of the whole Rittenhouse trial.
[03:54:44.842 --> 03:54:51.387]  I thought it was interesting that the verdict just came out and nobody's really talking about Ghislaine and that trial started about
[03:54:51.758 --> 03:54:52.878]  Three days ago, I believe.
[03:54:52.878 --> 03:55:00.041]  So I was just wondering if you thought, either of you thought, that there was some sort of connection between the two, or if it's just like merely a coincidence.
[03:55:00.041 --> 03:55:07.944]  The Feds definitely timed the Ghislaine Maxwell trial with the Rittenhouse trial, because that's not getting any coverage at all.
[03:55:07.944 --> 03:55:09.205]  It's completely flown out of the radar.
[03:55:09.205 --> 03:55:12.406]  They have, they realized that this was our time, so they were going to either
[03:55:13.362 --> 03:55:15.923]  Have her commit suicide, as Jeffrey Epstein did, obviously.
[03:55:15.923 --> 03:55:17.164]  A little too obvious.
[03:55:17.164 --> 03:55:18.464]  Yeah, a little too obvious.
[03:55:18.464 --> 03:55:22.906]  Or they could say, well, we'll get her, we'll try her under the radar when everybody's focused on Renton House.
[03:55:22.906 --> 03:55:24.047]  So that's a good point.
[03:55:24.047 --> 03:55:31.450]  And it's a, I don't want to say it's a failure of me or Alex or any of us, because the Renton House case was obviously something fundamentally different.
[03:55:31.450 --> 03:55:32.370]  No, but you're right.
[03:55:32.370 --> 03:55:34.071]  They scale it at the same time as a diversion.
[03:55:34.071 --> 03:55:35.752]  Yeah, but we definitely need to turn our focus on there.
[03:55:35.752 --> 03:55:36.792]  We should all get on that.
[03:55:36.792 --> 03:55:37.653]  I'm glad, Spencer.
[03:55:37.653 --> 03:55:38.473]  Thank you, Spencer.
[03:55:38.473 --> 03:55:40.034]  Spencer, that's why we take calls.
[03:55:40.034 --> 03:55:41.835]  You guys always take us in other directions.
[03:55:41.835 --> 03:55:42.495]  Anything else, Spencer?
[03:55:43.672 --> 03:55:45.213]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[03:55:45.213 --> 03:55:54.079]  Helen, Tony, Thomas, we're going to transfer your calls to the other studio that's literally just 60, 70 feet away.
[03:55:54.079 --> 03:55:58.602]  And we're going to go to your calls within the first 10 minutes of the war with Owen Schroer.
[03:55:58.602 --> 03:56:00.223]  I'm going to be co-hosting with Owen.
[03:56:00.223 --> 03:56:02.384]  I'm going to go in there right now with him.
[03:56:02.384 --> 03:56:05.886]  Max Hermanns and his crew has got a deserved lunch, a late lunch.
[03:56:05.886 --> 03:56:06.647]  They're going to get some lunch.
[03:56:06.647 --> 03:56:07.548]  We'll see what happens with them.
[03:56:08.737 --> 03:56:10.099]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[03:56:10.099 --> 03:56:11.600]  Great job to everybody.
[03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:16.907]  This has been another amazing transmission and all that you spread in the word and reaching new people is amazing.
[03:56:16.907 --> 03:56:24.676]  But like Mike said, actually you getting out there, being citizen journalist, I know you're very humble people, but think of that office you're in.
[03:56:24.676 --> 03:56:26.097]  It's very easy to do.
[03:56:26.097 --> 03:56:27.139]  You've got to be the resistance.
[03:56:27.139 --> 03:56:27.940]  You've got to be the leadership.
[03:56:27.940 --> 03:56:28.981]  Mike Cernovich, Closing Comments.
[03:56:29.181 --> 03:56:30.081]  Don't let them bait you.
[03:56:30.081 --> 03:56:32.082]  When you go out and do this, they're going to try to bait you.
[03:56:32.082 --> 03:56:32.763]  Who are you with?
[03:56:32.763 --> 03:56:33.803]  What are you doing?
[03:56:33.803 --> 03:56:34.463]  Why are you here?
[03:56:34.463 --> 03:56:36.484]  They might even shove you a little bit.
[03:56:36.484 --> 03:56:41.506]  Remember, you have to be wise as a serpent, gentle as a dove, but wise.
[03:56:41.506 --> 03:56:42.507]  They're going to try to bait you.
[03:56:42.507 --> 03:56:46.088]  Well, tell them, tell them I'm a local stringer because they trust the mainstream media.
[03:56:46.088 --> 03:56:46.968]  You're not lying.
[03:56:46.968 --> 03:56:48.009]  You're a stringer for God.
[03:56:48.009 --> 03:56:49.229]  You're a stringer for the Internet.
[03:56:49.229 --> 03:56:52.231]  But you say a stringer just people that shoots video and people buy it.
[03:56:52.231 --> 03:56:52.851]  Say I'm a stringer.
[03:56:53.151 --> 03:56:54.712]  Yep, that's a great point.
[03:56:54.712 --> 03:56:55.533]  I'm a stringer.
[03:56:55.533 --> 03:56:56.914]  I'm doing freelance work.
[03:56:56.914 --> 03:56:59.756]  I sell my footage to, you know, media outlets.
[03:56:59.756 --> 03:57:02.398]  Because it's not a lie if you're trying to sell your footage.
[03:57:02.398 --> 03:57:06.561]  They just say, oh yeah, I get footage and then I get it on the news and the media and everything like that.
[03:57:06.561 --> 03:57:08.963]  And then they'll think you're part of the establishment.
[03:57:08.963 --> 03:57:13.346]  Stringers will save the world because it's an info war and they want to intimidate everybody.
[03:57:13.346 --> 03:57:15.428]  And maybe you do it for six months, they ban your account.
[03:57:15.428 --> 03:57:16.489]  Somebody else steps up.
[03:57:16.489 --> 03:57:17.850]  Just everybody do your part.
[03:57:18.831 --> 03:57:20.452]  Not the Hydra, but the good Hydra.
[03:57:20.452 --> 03:57:22.713]  They cut your head off, but a hundred more heads appear.
[03:57:22.713 --> 03:57:24.894]  That's exactly what happens, like starfish.
[03:57:24.894 --> 03:57:27.055]  All right, best website for folks to visit?
[03:57:27.055 --> 03:57:28.776]  HoaxTheMovie.com.
[03:57:28.776 --> 03:57:34.278]  And sign up, folks, to get critical, original information first with our big project that's a secret.
[03:57:34.278 --> 03:57:36.359]  It is ResetWars.com.
[03:57:36.359 --> 03:57:37.620]  ResetWars.com.

[03:57:40.361 --> 03:57:41.662]  ResetWars.com.
[03:57:44.813 --> 03:57:47.354]  For a fraction, I know you're humble.
[03:57:47.354 --> 03:57:49.035]  I know you're like me.
[03:57:49.035 --> 03:58:01.902]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate on the fact that those of you that have supported my broadcast and InfoWars over the years have changed the world in incredible ways.
[03:58:01.902 --> 03:58:03.683]  And now, as 2021 prepares to end and 2022
[03:58:07.892 --> 03:58:08.913]  It begins to dawn.
[03:58:08.913 --> 03:58:15.296]  It is more important than ever that you realize how important you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[03:58:15.296 --> 03:58:17.537]  The tip of the spear is Banned.Billion.
[03:58:17.537 --> 03:58:21.699]  The very front lines of the fight for human liberty is InfoWars.com.
[03:58:21.699 --> 03:58:26.342]  And we can't stay on air without your support, so thank you all for your support.
[03:58:26.342 --> 03:58:30.464]  Donate to our legal defense fund to stay on the air and save InfoWars.com.

[03:58:49.895 --> 03:58:51.076]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:58:51.076 --> 03:58:51.876]  Granny Do-Right.
[03:58:51.876 --> 03:58:52.977]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:58:52.977 --> 03:58:53.537]  Go ahead.
[03:58:53.537 --> 03:58:54.057]  Hey, Alex.
[03:58:54.057 --> 03:58:56.679]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[03:58:56.679 --> 03:59:07.384]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[03:59:07.384 --> 03:59:13.388]  But since taking Urex 2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[03:59:13.388 --> 03:59:14.388]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[03:59:16.669 --> 03:59:24.395]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[03:59:24.395 --> 03:59:33.142]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[03:59:33.142 --> 03:59:33.963]  This is working.
[03:59:33.963 --> 03:59:34.964]  This is wonderful.
[03:59:34.964 --> 03:59:39.427]  You know, I don't, I don't have to put on Dermablend anymore, you know.
[03:59:39.427 --> 03:59:44.171]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[03:59:49.204 --> 03:59:53.115]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
