[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.991]  It's Sunday, April 25th, the year is 2021.
[00:00:03.411 --> 00:00:06.472]  Alex Jones here on this special broadcast.
[00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:28.664]  Owen Schroer is about to be taking over for the remainder of the transmission, but I wanted just to up front thank the listeners and all of our affiliates and the crew, the sponsors, everybody else for your support and your prayers because as negative as things are and as bad as things have been, we've got a lot of data showing us now that the Great Reset has backfired on the globalists.
[00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:33.276]  And their attempt to forcibly inoculate the planet has blown up in their face.
[00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.998]  Yes, the United States is the most vaccinated with this poison in the world.
[00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.419]  Next to the UK, we're over 15%.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.682]  But now it's stopping dead in its tracks because so many people are literally dropping dead.
[00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:50.444]  They're also getting giant herpes-like infections all over their bodies.
[00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:52.645]  Women are becoming sterile.
[00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:55.086]  Women are growing tumors inside their uteruses.
[00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:57.227]  And again, this is all negative and sad.
[00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:07.633]  But they tried to stampede people, and a lot of folks held back and waited, and when they saw such massive carnage, it triggered a huge awakening.
[00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.675]  And I'm not just seeing it with the data, I'm seeing it on the street.
[00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:15.615]  A lot of people that were saying I was full of it are apologizing.
[00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.678]  So there is a lot of really spectacular developments happening.
[00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:20.499]  It's very, very sad.
[00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:23.540]  There's a very famous actor in India.
[00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:25.882]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:30.205]  He went on national TV and took the shot and said everybody should take it.
[00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:31.025]  It's totally safe.
[00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.287]  And that's the Indian government shot.
[00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.368]  They banned the Pfizer shot.
[00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:37.830]  He died of a massive heart attack the next day.
[00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.592]  Well, these type of vaccines cause inflammation in the brain.
[00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:48.643]  And if you already have close to blocked arteries in your heart, you're going to die, folks.
[00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:51.404]  That's in the mainline literature.
[00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:56.426]  Like, don't give a pregnant woman any type of vaccine, much less an mRNA.
[00:01:57.646 --> 00:01:59.106]  So the globalists made their run at us.
[00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:01.807]  They did this as a test to see what we put up with.
[00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.288]  The lockdown was very successful up front.
[00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:09.750]  The fraud of the six feet space and all of that garbage worked for a while.
[00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.556]  And it shows that leftists all over the planet have really bought a hook, line, and sinker.
[00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:14.677]  We're far from out of the woods.
[00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:19.160]  But Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts his pants on.
[00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.462]  That has happened yet again.
[00:02:22.982 --> 00:02:24.744]  Because at first they had the jump on us.
[00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:25.744]  They had the hysteria.
[00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:26.965]  They had the fear.
[00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.407]  They had the chi-com propaganda.
[00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:32.048]  But now it's starting to backfire on them.
[00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.171]  And so at first they had us in full collapse to their will.
[00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:40.534]  And now opposition formed, and now it's reversing very, very, very quickly.
[00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:50.781]  But it's more important than ever that we drive the point home now, that we don't wear the mask, that we talk to everybody we know, that we say no, that we say take the mask off our children particularly.
[00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.481]  It's abusive.
[00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.364]  It's causing track runners to collapse, have their lungs collapse.
[00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:57.966]  It's causing children to get bacterial pneumonia.
[00:02:57.986 --> 00:02:59.627]  And it's very important we get on the offense
[00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:16.813]  With these governors and people, not just the Santas, but people like the Texas Governor Abbott, to come out and say we were hoaxed, to come out and say we were scammed, because now it's a propaganda organ of the globalists, CNN saying, OK, the finish line is almost here.
[00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.414]  Well, I guess we'll go ahead and back off this.
[00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:28.245]  And that's because they want to be the ones that declare the world open again right before they clamp it back down with a new virus, which you better believe is coming.
[00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:39.169]  So we have to get on the total offense, exposing the criminals, exposing the Wuhan lab, exposing Fauci, Bill Gates as the scammers, owning part of the vaccine companies, having conflicts of interest.
[00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.130]  We have to remind everybody that these vaccines were never approved around the world and have been banned all over the world.
[00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:45.351]  Think of that victory!
[00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.428]  All the vaccines have been banned in different countries.
[00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:50.668]  Some in different countries.
[00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:58.170]  But some of the vaccines have been completely banned in Europe, completely banned in Australia, completely banned in areas of Africa and Latin America.
[00:03:58.671 --> 00:03:59.271]  The U.S.
[00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:03.492]  is the dumping ground for every poison that's out there because, again, we're the main target of this.
[00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:06.453]  So we have to keep exposing the Great Reset Agenda.
[00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.994]  We have to expose this is only their first big salvo.
[00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.815]  But as the battle begins into the future,
[00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.495]  This is going very, very good compared to what the globalists wanted.
[00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:16.897]  They are in deep trouble.
[00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.348]  Their program is in freefall.
[00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:20.749]  Their lie is in freefall.
[00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.290]  It was never approved.
[00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.630]  It was never authorized.
[00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.572]  It was a giant genetic engineering testing.
[00:04:26.092 --> 00:04:30.194]  They couldn't get these things approved before, so they did this giant hoax to shove it on us.
[00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:35.578]  And thanks to InfoWars, and thanks to you, and thanks to God above, we are going to win this fight.
[00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:37.219]  So Owen Schroeder is coming up live today.
[00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.740]  But as negative as stuff is, this is very, very positive.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.123]  Now let's expose the whole race war hoax, divide and conquer, and the open border strategy.
[00:04:44.363 --> 00:04:45.944]  They're pushing us well, and we can win this thing.
[00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:50.607]  Because Biden just announced an 800-fold increase of illegal aliens coming to the United States.
[00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:57.391]  So that's the next big fight to expose, secure our borders, secure the Republic, expose the Great Reset Replacement Migration Program.
[00:04:59.453 --> 00:05:13.582]  Think about the epic times you're in, where the entire world and its governments are involved in the planning and the execution
[00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:17.699]  Of a pandemic.
[00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:23.281]  Some call it a scam-demic, a plannedemic, a fake pandemic, call it whatever you want.
[00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:43.050]  They pulled it off, they did it worldwide, and now they are forcing citizens, they are forcing humans to consume their big pharmaceutical product, their DNA therapy technology.
[00:05:44.787 --> 00:06:02.453]  Using the fear of their plan-demic to roll it out and then the holding you hostage with lockdowns and shutting down your businesses and churches and the threats if you don't comply.
[00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:10.016]  Holding you hostage to the pandemic, forcing you to consume the big pharmaceutical product and
[00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.951]  It's hard to really wrap your mind around it.
[00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:16.033]  It's hard to accept that that's the reality.
[00:06:18.615 --> 00:06:33.246]  But once you can understand that and how diabolical it is, you begin to open your mind and your heart to many of the diabolical truths that we are experiencing, that people are in denial about.
[00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:41.133]  And so, when you have people getting the vaccine,
[00:06:42.324 --> 00:07:00.341]  And then dropping dead days later, whether it's famous American athletes like Hank Aaron, or it is the Public Health Ambassador of India who promotes the vaccine, says it's great, then dies after getting it.
[00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:04.325]  That is not a coincidence.
[00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:16.769]  And you had panels of doctors around the world that came out a year ago and said, there's no need for these lockdowns.
[00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:19.030]  There's no need for these closures.
[00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.691]  There's no need for this response to a COVID virus.
[00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:23.392]  If anything, we should be getting outside more.
[00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:25.192]  We should continue to live our normal lives.
[00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:26.753]  We shouldn't be wearing masks.
[00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:38.457]  But no, the global health establishment, which is supposed to have your best interests in mind, supposed to care about your health, told you to wear a mask.
[00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:47.343]  After they told you not to wear a mask, then they told you to wear a mask, then they said wear two masks, wear three if you have them, four if you can afford it.
[00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:51.285]  Maybe not in the Biden economy, but you can afford five.
[00:07:55.788 --> 00:08:03.313]  And then you had high school athletes dropping from oxygen deprivation.
[00:08:03.913 --> 00:08:05.314]  That happened last summer too.
[00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:06.234]  The media didn't report it.
[00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:07.715]  Now it's happening again and
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.843]  The coaches and local media is actually a little more privy to what's going on.
[00:08:13.983 --> 00:08:14.824]  Oh, it's the mask?
[00:08:15.264 --> 00:08:16.505]  They can't get oxygen.
[00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:17.206]  Oh.
[00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:19.327]  That makes sense.
[00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.192]  And now you have a story up at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.534]  Disturbing.
[00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:32.778]  Vaccine zoomed with microscope appears to show living cells and organisms mixed in.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.041]  Soylent green is people!
[00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:54.551]  Laboratory footage of what is alleged to be Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine shows puzzled German scientists debating what exactly they're looking at under the microscope, as apparently organisms separate from the viral particles are discovered.
[00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:57.573]  It's not quite clear to me what we have seen here, one scientist said.
[00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:01.235]  So, this is content from the Pfizer vaccine, a colleague said.
[00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:03.256]  This is from Pfizer, yes.
[00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:06.458]  Wow, but do you know what it is yet?
[00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:07.899]  No!
[00:09:09.056 --> 00:09:11.458]  It could be a Morgellon.
[00:09:11.478 --> 00:09:17.022]  And it goes on from there.
[00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:29.151]  So imagine... a super contagious, if you will,
[00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:33.064]  Gain-of-function is the term they use.
[00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:41.068]  So a gain-of-function research virus, which is just one of the number one viruses, the flu virus, the COVID virus.
[00:09:42.369 --> 00:09:46.771]  Gain-of-function research was to be shut down in a U.S.
[00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:47.172]  lab.
[00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:51.434]  It was then moved to a lab in Wuhan, China, where they continued the research.
[00:09:51.714 --> 00:09:53.155]  It then escaped from that lab.
[00:09:54.415 --> 00:09:57.117]  We had multiple drills and events and planning
[00:09:58.863 --> 00:10:08.047]  About a pandemic in 2020, even using the COVID virus as the pretext, and everything else that followed with the censorship and the shutdowns.
[00:10:10.688 --> 00:10:19.692]  And then on the back end, now billions, they say billions of vaccines have been administered worldwide.
[00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:24.794]  That's some freaky deaky stuff.
[00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:32.100]  And then they zoom in on the vaccine with a microscope and they say, what the hell is that?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:43.863]  I've covered threads on Twitter where someone, a viral thread where someone has their vaccine card and say, oh, for the first time in my life, I'm glad I've had, I have asthma.
[00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.410]  Look, I got my vaccine first.
[00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.551]  I'm having awful, horrible side effects, but I'm still really glad.
[00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:54.232]  And then it's all these other people chiming in, hey, I had this side effect, I had that side effect.
[00:10:54.672 --> 00:10:58.132]  But they're still celebrating that they've been vaccinated.
[00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:04.093]  In the new religion, where George Floyd is the saint, he sacrificed himself, is what they say.
[00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:08.594]  So now, they sacrifice themselves for what they believe is the greater good, getting vaccinated.
[00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:13.415]  And if that means becoming infertile, if that means
[00:11:14.738 --> 00:11:17.799]  Getting Guillain-Barré or Bell's Palsy or hell, dying?
[00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.280]  Well, that's just the fight.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.260]  That's just the good fight for the good lib.
[00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.522]  So now Jimmy Dore posts this.
[00:11:27.983 --> 00:11:29.484]  Should I be concerned that this is lasting for a week?
[00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:30.204]  Should he be concerned?
[00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:31.344]  Should you be concerned, Jimmy?
[00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:47.927]  What do you think?
[00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:54.711]  Not to make light of your plight, but yeah, that vaccine poisoned you, bud.
[00:11:56.312 --> 00:11:57.753]  I know you don't like to admit it.
[00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:00.154]  I know it's a tough pill to swallow.
[00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:06.457]  Anyone else have similar experience, he asked?
[00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:08.438]  And then it's the same thing.
[00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:10.520]  And you can go down on the list.
[00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:14.524]  And everybody talks about the awful side effects.
[00:12:14.744 --> 00:12:15.684]  Shortness of breath.
[00:12:16.364 --> 00:12:17.104]  Fatigue.
[00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:21.265]  Somebody diagnosed with Bell's Palsy.
[00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:24.366]  My life has been miserable since the shot.
[00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:27.247]  And again, you can go down there and scroll through all of these things.
[00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:33.088]  And then you have people on there saying, Don't worry!
[00:12:33.388 --> 00:12:35.669]  The side effects are better than getting the virus!
[00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.389]  What?
[00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.771]  Remember, it came out that most people that get the virus don't even ever know they had it.
[00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:43.131]  Remember that deal?
[00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.792]  COVID arm is the new trend after you get the vaccine.
[00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:49.712]  COVID arm!
[00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:52.453]  What to know after getting the Moderna-Pfizer vaccine?
[00:12:52.793 --> 00:12:58.594]  Folks, they have waiting areas after you get the vaccine.
[00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:04.656]  They have waiting areas where they have people sit aside in case they have an adverse reaction.
[00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:06.836]  They have to sit there for 10-15 minutes and then they'll let you go.
[00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:11.246]  Most people begin to have severe reactions within 10 to 15 minutes.
[00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:12.066]  They may seize up.
[00:13:13.307 --> 00:13:14.208]  They may collapse.
[00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:15.029]  They may faint.
[00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:22.695]  And so they have to wait in the waiting area to make sure that they don't faint or keel over and need emergency support right then and there on the scene from getting the vaccine.
[00:13:27.318 --> 00:13:28.659]  Yeah, this is diabolical.
[00:13:31.862 --> 00:13:36.726]  Yeah, this is a very corrupt planet.
[00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:44.321]  This is a very corrupt world government that we're just starting to see into.
[00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:48.165]  That we're just starting to see work itself out.
[00:13:48.205 --> 00:13:50.228]  That we're just starting to see how it operates.
[00:13:50.248 --> 00:13:53.791]  That we're just starting to see its actual levers of power.
[00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:56.695]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:13:58.436 --> 00:13:59.658]  This is just the beginning.
[00:14:01.209 --> 00:14:04.452]  And they're sending SWAT teams to churches that won't shut down.
[00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:06.975]  They've arrested business owners that won't shut down.
[00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:10.959]  Most people are completely over the fake pandemic by now.
[00:14:13.681 --> 00:14:16.785]  But see, they still have to get you to take that jab.
[00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:20.148]  And so they pay social media influencers to promote it.
[00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.991]  They pay cable news networks to promote it.
[00:14:24.141 --> 00:14:25.682]  And the FDA doesn't even approve it.
[00:14:26.422 --> 00:14:28.083]  The side effects are worse than the virus.
[00:14:28.623 --> 00:14:30.324]  And this is the planet you're experiencing.
[00:14:30.364 --> 00:14:31.464]  This is life on Earth.
[00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:45.991]  Much of the world is awakening to the global government conspiracy that was hiding in plain sight.
[00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:53.445]  And is against you, the individual, being empowered?
[00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:55.867]  Against you, the individual, controlling your own fate?
[00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:15.041]  And there's been a lot of developments recently that have exposed this to people, whether it's the theft of our elections that are being investigated in Arizona, whether it's the COVID fake pandemic, scandemic, that crushed the economy, made the richest people in the world richer.
[00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:19.009]  They had drills and somehow knew it was all coming.
[00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.630]  Came out of a lab in China, they covered it up.
[00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:29.392]  What you were seeing there was footage of a anti-lockdown march in Canada.
[00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:34.033]  The pushing of the vaccine.
[00:15:34.053 --> 00:15:39.254]  That was in UK, thank you.
[00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:46.715]  So now that global government is out in the open, we have the chance to reject it.
[00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:57.985]  But we have to admit it, accept it, be truthful, be honest about how diabolical it is, and wholeheartedly reject it.
[00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.470]  And I don't know what to do with this mystery element of the factors.
[00:16:04.448 --> 00:16:11.332]  Which is the insane, mentally ill, deranged, radical left that seems to want global enslavement.
[00:16:11.392 --> 00:16:12.892]  Seems to want global government.
[00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:13.633]  Very odd.
[00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:17.135]  But that's the truth.
[00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:18.495]  They live the big lie.
[00:16:18.575 --> 00:16:20.196]  They love the big media lie.
[00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:23.458]  There's another element that's woken people up.
[00:16:23.798 --> 00:16:30.862]  They've seen the media, just the mainstream media, the television news just turn out to be complete outright frauds and liars.
[00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:33.203]  Tellers of tales.
[00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:46.133]  I want to finish up on this vaccine coverage here before we have Laura Loomer joining us with an exciting announcement coming up.
[00:16:47.513 --> 00:16:55.818]  Again, you can find these threads on Twitter where people just talk about their negative vaccine side effects.
[00:16:55.838 --> 00:16:59.500]  I prefer to be organic.
[00:17:00.121 --> 00:17:01.101]  I'm an organic human.
[00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:07.185]  I don't take mRNA gene therapy vaccines.
[00:17:08.564 --> 00:17:18.011]  Now, we know that, I believe the number was 78%, who knows, it's about three quarters of the people hospitalized or died from COVID were obese.
[00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:25.356]  But CNN is celebrating this list of all the free stuff you can get if you get your vaccine.
[00:17:26.037 --> 00:17:28.218]  I don't have the whole list in front of me, but here's some short ones for you.
[00:17:28.518 --> 00:17:30.039]  Krispy Kreme Donuts!
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.261]  Get yourself a nice glaze.
[00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:34.643]  Junior's Cheesecake!
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.741]  Goes right to your behind.
[00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:38.782]  Nathan's Hot Dogs!
[00:17:40.283 --> 00:17:41.184]  What do you think's in those?
[00:17:41.745 --> 00:17:43.005]  White Castle!
[00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.088]  Yes, because skinny people are known to eat there.
[00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:51.912]  So, they know that being obese is one of the worst things for your health.
[00:17:52.713 --> 00:18:00.558]  They know that, in particular, being obese can heighten your risk for COVID or COVID complications.
[00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:03.500]  But hey, get that vaccine.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.301]  And then go get yourself a Krispy Kreme.
[00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:07.042]  I mean, think about it.
[00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:08.002]  You could have a whole day.
[00:18:08.022 --> 00:18:10.644]  Go get yourself a vaccine.
[00:18:10.684 --> 00:18:12.545]  Get your Krispy Kreme donut for breakfast.
[00:18:13.386 --> 00:18:15.187]  Get your Nathan's hot dogs for lunch.
[00:18:16.248 --> 00:18:17.789]  Go to White Castle for dinner.
[00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:22.952]  And by the time you're crapping your pants, you'll be shoving a Junior's cheesecake down your throat.
[00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:27.235]  But hey, that free vaccine was worth it, baby.
[00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:32.839]  Yeah, you're a little numb in your left arm and you can't really walk straight anymore, but phew!
[00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.593]  Was that glazed donut great or what?
[00:18:39.676 --> 00:18:41.016]  And you continue to see the stories.
[00:18:41.917 --> 00:18:45.899]  India's public health ambassador dies day after taking COVID vaccine.
[00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:46.620]  He promotes it.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.620]  He says it's great.
[00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:48.701]  He takes it.
[00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.481]  He dies.
[00:18:50.602 --> 00:18:51.843]  And they always want to cover this up.
[00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:56.946]  Whether it's Hank Aaron or the health ambassador in India.
[00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.411]  Oh, oh, I can get a free beer.
[00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:01.771]  I can get a free lap dance.
[00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:03.932]  Oh yeah, all kinds of stuff.
[00:19:03.972 --> 00:19:04.932]  You get that vaccine.
[00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:07.273]  I mean, imagine, what happened to the basic instinct?
[00:19:07.653 --> 00:19:14.355]  You know, a guy comes to your neighborhood with a white van and says, Hey kids, want some candy?
[00:19:17.876 --> 00:19:21.217]  Pennywise the clown, there's popcorn down here.
[00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:22.717]  It's a circus.
[00:19:23.937 --> 00:19:25.878]  Don't you want some popcorn?
[00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.990]  That's the vaccine.
[00:19:31.491 --> 00:19:32.331]  Hey, look!
[00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:34.631]  I got a vaccine for ya!
[00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:35.731]  It's a jab!
[00:19:37.192 --> 00:19:38.952]  There's Krispy Kreme Donuts!
[00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:41.673]  There's Nathan's Hot Dogs!
[00:19:42.813 --> 00:19:44.133]  There's White Castles!
[00:19:45.554 --> 00:19:46.594]  There's Strip Clubs!
[00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:47.994]  Come on!
[00:19:48.794 --> 00:19:49.815]  Get your vaccine!
[00:19:50.775 --> 00:19:51.975]  Come down here with me!
[00:19:53.395 --> 00:19:54.996]  Don't you wanna hang out with me?
[00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:58.374]  With all the donuts and strippers?
[00:19:59.215 --> 00:19:59.995]  And beers?
[00:20:00.856 --> 00:20:02.137]  We got cold beers!
[00:20:03.478 --> 00:20:04.599]  Come on down here!
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.041]  Get the jab!
[00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:09.103]  I gotta need you to take that jab, though!
[00:20:11.225 --> 00:20:18.471]  Meanwhile, Merc pulls out, pulls the plug on COVID-19 vaccine program after disappointing trial data.
[00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:18.892]  Oops!
[00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:22.056]  Yeah, just another one with disappointing trial data.
[00:20:22.536 --> 00:20:23.597]  Most of them didn't even care!
[00:20:23.817 --> 00:20:26.999]  Most of them had the disappointing trial data and then still rolled it out to market.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.882]  MIT study suggests six foot social distancing.
[00:20:31.382 --> 00:20:33.484]  Limited occupancy rates are completely pointless.
[00:20:35.005 --> 00:20:35.986]  You don't say.
[00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:38.387]  Boy, who would have guessed that?
[00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:40.709]  Some schmuck.
[00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:44.312]  They would have thought the whole thing was garbage.
[00:20:44.352 --> 00:20:45.152]  Some schmuck.
[00:20:45.773 --> 00:20:48.395]  Looks like the schmuck was right, but hey!
[00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:51.914]  Let's check out what's going on.
[00:20:53.555 --> 00:20:55.095]  We've got more side effects here.
[00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:55.975]  Clip five.
[00:20:57.056 --> 00:21:05.477]  If the Krispy Kreme donut and the Nathan hot dogs and the White Castle wasn't enough, maybe some herpes will be good for ya.
[00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:12.439]  And roll clip five.
[00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:18.876]  Herpes infections may be a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.
[00:21:19.256 --> 00:21:28.878]  Scientists in Israel are researching six cases in which all patients were given that Pfizer jab, and later developed herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles.
[00:21:29.698 --> 00:21:35.039]  The infection starts off as a small rash, but can include a long-lasting burning sensation even after the rash is gone.
[00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:36.239]  But don't worry!
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.600]  You can still get a Krispy Kreme donut!
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.921]  And I hear the strippers are really nice, too.
[00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:45.941]  They give you a free lap dance for every jab.
[00:21:48.603 --> 00:21:50.305]  So it's just another side effect.
[00:21:50.465 --> 00:21:51.866]  And, you know, they'll continue to promote it.
[00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:55.169]  Joe Biden just put out a tweet saying, get vaccinated, America.
[00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.051]  That's not totalitarian at all.
[00:21:58.091 --> 00:21:59.172]  That's not medical tyranny.
[00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:00.293]  That's not scary at all.
[00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:06.579]  With all the side effects and the death and everything and the virus, 99.9% survivable.
[00:22:06.879 --> 00:22:10.682]  Now you have European doctors in Norway that's based on their data
[00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:17.630]  You have less of a risk of having complications from COVID than from the COVID vaccine.
[00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.070]  And what did President Trump say?
[00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.831]  We can't have a cure that's worse than the disease.
[00:22:23.732 --> 00:22:26.653]  Well, that's the lockdowns, that's the shutdown, that's the vaccine.
[00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:29.354]  So, this is the new world order.
[00:22:29.394 --> 00:22:30.474]  This is global government.
[00:22:30.514 --> 00:22:31.474]  This is medical tyranny.
[00:22:31.834 --> 00:22:36.016]  This is what it's like to be treated like a slave, like a commodity.
[00:22:36.536 --> 00:22:37.856]  And this is just the beginning.
[00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:39.117]  They're just getting you used to it.
[00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:44.932]  Laura Loomer joining us on the other side with a big announcement.
[00:22:45.293 --> 00:22:46.213]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[00:22:46.273 --> 00:22:48.155]  Remember folks, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:48.695]  Check it out.
[00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:51.478]  Vezo Beat Complete.
[00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.540]  Back in stock.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.682]  Blood flow, blood flow, blood flow.
[00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:58.564]  Vezo Beat Complete, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:03.668]  I think we may be missing one of these bottles of Vezo Beat Complete.
[00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:06.030]  I may pull a Clintons at the White House.
[00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:07.652]  Fine now.
[00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:23.800]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and you are tuned in to the most banned news network in the world, InfoWars.
[00:23:24.481 --> 00:23:26.383]  Next year's news today.
[00:23:26.944 --> 00:23:33.270]  That's why it's always important to support us by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com, and that's why it's important to support people like Laura Loomer.
[00:23:34.178 --> 00:23:39.262]  Who are totally banned and deplatformed as well, who joins me now.
[00:23:40.463 --> 00:23:46.108]  Laura, I know that you're up to quite a few things politically and then some local activism there in Florida.
[00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:48.450]  What is the next big thing?
[00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.353]  What is the next thing people need to know Laura Loomer is up to?
[00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.424]  Thanks for having me on, Owen.
[00:23:54.484 --> 00:24:05.569]  So as we've discussed on your show over the last couple weeks, as Governor DeSantis proposed his big big tech censorship bill, the Florida legislative session ends on Friday.
[00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:16.153]  And so what this means is that the Republican legislature here in Florida has five days to include the amendments in this big tech bill, or else it's just going to be an empty bill.
[00:24:16.534 --> 00:24:17.334]  And, you know,
[00:24:17.975 --> 00:24:29.303]  Governor DeSantis has promised to deliver the most comprehensive and toughest big tech censorship bill in the country is going to fall short because as it currently stands, the bill has no teeth.
[00:24:29.964 --> 00:24:37.509]  And so on Tuesday, I'm going to be having a press conference and a big rally to put pressure on these lawmakers to include the amendments in the bill.
[00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:41.592]  And Michelle Malkin's coming down, Nick Fuentes, Lauren Witski, Vincent James.
[00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:51.497]  And we're hoping to have, you know, hundreds if not thousands of people show up because we need this legislation to be more than just a do-nothing bill.
[00:24:53.118 --> 00:24:55.159]  So, get more into the details here.
[00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:58.081]  What is it that you want to see done that DeSantis isn't doing?
[00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:00.002]  And how does this translate?
[00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:08.406]  I mean, how can people in Florida take justice into their own hands against Big Tech versus other states if you can, you know, get more teeth into this bill?
[00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:09.799]  Right.
[00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:24.407]  So when Governor DeSantis went on Tucker Carlson about two months or so ago and he said that he was going to, you know, pass the toughest tech legislation in the country, he said that it was going to effectively prevent big tech from deplatforming political candidates.
[00:25:24.447 --> 00:25:30.250]  Well, if you look at the language within the bill, you'll see that a candidate is defined as a statewide candidate.
[00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.493]  Which is a senator or somebody running for a statewide position.
[00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:37.816]  That doesn't include federal positions like my campaign, which is a congressional campaign.
[00:25:38.217 --> 00:25:44.001]  Or if Donald Trump decides to run for president again in 2024, he will not be protected by this legislation.
[00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:50.206]  And so, as it currently stands, Governor DeSantis himself would not be protected by this legislation.
[00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:54.970]  And so, one of the amendments that I proposed is making it retroactive.
[00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:55.391]  And so,
[00:25:56.474 --> 00:26:05.704]  The way it's worded right now is that it would only penalize big tech social media companies $10,000 to $100,000 a day if they de-platform a candidate.
[00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:08.226]  So that is an act of action, of course.
[00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:12.451]  That's not going to apply to somebody like myself or somebody like Donald Trump or
[00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:19.314]  Let me ask you this, though.
[00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:29.939]  What if, you know, yes, you're banning everyone on Twitter, but let's say you started a new account, would it then fall into the realm of that, saying, hey, no, this is a new account, Laura Loomer, for Congress, they can't ban you now?
[00:26:30.782 --> 00:26:36.886]  You can't have new accounts because what Twitter and Facebook did is they created new policies when I was a candidate.
[00:26:36.906 --> 00:26:42.670]  So their policy was prior to me announcing that if you are a candidate, you will get a verified account.
[00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.931]  Then when I filed it was you have to win your primary, right?
[00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:46.692]  Because they thought I wasn't going to win my primary.
[00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:51.916]  Then I won my primary and they changed the policy to basically everybody besides Laura Loomer can have an account.
[00:26:52.296 --> 00:27:04.221]  Then Facebook saw they were going to encounter the same problem and so they created a policy that said if you have been previously banned, it doesn't matter if you're running for office or even if you become an elected official, you are not allowed to have an account.
[00:27:04.962 --> 00:27:09.023]  Okay, so they've already written basically policy to fight back against this.
[00:27:09.924 --> 00:27:11.204]  Yes, they have and they did it in 2019 and 2020.
[00:27:14.301 --> 00:27:23.825]  And so I tried to let DeSantis' team know, and I met with these Florida Republican legislators to tell them, you know, listen, it's not as simple as just creating a new account.
[00:27:23.925 --> 00:27:29.027]  It's not as simple as, oh, okay, this bill is going to penalize tech companies and then candidates are going to be on.
[00:27:29.067 --> 00:27:36.850]  First of all, these companies are worth over $7 trillion, which is more than a quarter of the United States economy, our $21 trillion U.S.
[00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.630]  economy, okay?
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.542]  $100,000 a day or $10,000 a day is like pennies in a bucket for these people.
[00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:45.463]  It's not punitive.
[00:27:45.483 --> 00:27:50.366]  And so the damages need to be upwards of $100 million a day, which is what I've been proposing.
[00:27:50.726 --> 00:27:56.069]  And so I've been calling some of the amendments are to increase the fines and the penalties so that they're actually punitive.
[00:27:56.579 --> 00:28:02.986]  And then another one as well is to make it retroactive so that it applies to candidates who have been previously deplatformed.
[00:28:03.347 --> 00:28:11.476]  And then I'm also calling on the legislation to include penalties for payment processors because it's very surface level, this discussion that these lawmakers are having.
[00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.838]  They only want to talk about Facebook and Twitter.
[00:28:13.878 --> 00:28:15.699]  Well, what about Chase?
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.301]  What about Stripe that just banned me?
[00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:18.081]  What about YouTube?
[00:28:18.102 --> 00:28:19.403]  What about PayPal, which has banned me?
[00:28:19.423 --> 00:28:20.403]  What about Venmo, right?
[00:28:20.864 --> 00:28:30.772]  All these companies that are disenfranchising people and harming people's lives and threatening their livelihood, debanking them, trying to blacklist them financially.
[00:28:31.012 --> 00:28:34.095]  There also needs to be penalties for companies like that, right?
[00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:34.896]  Don't you agree?
[00:28:36.135 --> 00:28:37.076]  Well, here's my issue.
[00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:49.749]  I feel like nobody's really taking this issue seriously because we can write bills and stuff, but to me these Republicans are going and they're having conversations and they're probably meeting with lawyers and they're saying, okay, well, what can we do?
[00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:51.570]  Somebody has to take a step.
[00:28:51.611 --> 00:28:52.812]  Somebody has to take a leap.
[00:28:52.912 --> 00:28:57.516]  Like you said, maybe it's a hundred million dollar fine if you censor a political candidate.
[00:28:58.217 --> 00:29:05.384]  Somebody has to make some really large leaps here to push back against big tech censorship because right now they are clearly not threatened.
[00:29:05.664 --> 00:29:06.685]  They lie under her oath.
[00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:09.688]  They can censor Donald Trump, the President of the United States.
[00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:15.494]  So to me, they show no fear at all over any politician writing any serious legislation right now.
[00:29:17.034 --> 00:29:17.514]  Exactly.
[00:29:17.635 --> 00:29:21.497]  And that's because a lot of these Republican lawmakers don't know what they're talking about.
[00:29:21.778 --> 00:29:27.542]  And why would Big Tech show fear if the fines are, oh, we're going to censor Big Tech.
[00:29:27.562 --> 00:29:32.746]  We're going to fine Big Tech $100,000 a day if they de-platform candidates.
[00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:39.511]  Well, Big Tech clearly has their lawyers and their legal team, and they see that this doesn't currently apply to de-platformed candidates, right?
[00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:42.293]  And so you're talking about people like myself and Donald Trump.
[00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:44.975]  And then if you're worth trillions of dollars, well,
[00:29:45.655 --> 00:29:47.517]  What's $100,000 a day, you know?
[00:29:47.537 --> 00:30:00.448]  For them, it's almost going to pay off in the long run if they keep people censored and deplatformed by paying a couple million dollars in fines than it would be if they were to allow somebody like myself or Donald Trump to gain access or Governor DeSantis, you know?
[00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:08.575]  So, of course they're not going to be scared because these lawmakers also, they keep on approaching it from a Section 230 standpoint, which is
[00:30:08.956 --> 00:30:14.078]  You know, nonsensical because Section 230 is a federal mandate.
[00:30:14.398 --> 00:30:20.881]  So if Section 230 is a federal law, okay, you can't have state legislation addressing Section 230.
[00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:33.346]  And so the lawmakers need to start approaching the big tech issue as a civil rights issue, not a Section 230 issue, because people's civil rights are being violated when they're discriminated against and de-platformed for simply being conservative.
[00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:33.926]  And that's why
[00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:37.644]  You know, about a month and a half ago, I filed to run for Congress again.
[00:30:37.964 --> 00:30:42.366]  You can go to lumer2022.com and support my congressional campaign today.
[00:30:42.746 --> 00:30:54.310]  And one of the things that I want to do, aside from breaking up big tech, is also updating our civil rights laws to include political affiliation as a protected class so that we can protect people from being discriminated against.
[00:30:55.933 --> 00:31:01.437]  Laura, I want to talk about that event coming up again next week on the other side of this break.
[00:31:01.917 --> 00:31:03.038]  So sit right there, folks.
[00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:17.849]  Again, Laura Loomer, one of the most banned people out there, just like InfoWars, and we're kind of the mothership to give Laura a platform, to give other banned people a platform like myself, and it's all supported by you shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:19.751]  So folks, if you want Laura to keep fighting the good fight,
[00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:25.793]  Support her, support us so we can get her on air and let you know about her new developments and her events.
[00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:27.393]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:27.433 --> 00:31:29.634]  We still have the t-shirt special happening, by the way.

[00:31:43.998 --> 00:31:45.659]  I didn't even know that was our daily deal.
[00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:47.499]  We're selling it at cost right now.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.160]  So, uh,

[00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.512]  We'll be right back on the other side with Laura Loomer.
[00:32:29.148 --> 00:32:31.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:34.471 --> 00:32:36.351]  At the time, it got almost no coverage.
[00:32:37.532 --> 00:32:41.934]  But I told listeners and viewers, this is a key seismic moment.
[00:32:42.014 --> 00:32:56.681]  I have been watching what was unfolding in India, in Australia, in South Africa, and areas of Western Europe, where governments were saying, hey, these experimental vaccines are causing major, major health problems.
[00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.891]  They're not approved.
[00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:02.453]  We're just rolling it out and testing it on the public in general.
[00:33:03.434 --> 00:33:06.055]  Something is desperately wrong here.
[00:33:07.316 --> 00:33:25.908]  And then Merck, one of the most corrupt, evil, big pharma companies out there, with a horrible history of dumping deadly vaccines on the market like Gardasil, pulled out of not one but two of their vaccine programs and announced that they were exiting the COVID-19 vaccine race entirely.
[00:33:27.096 --> 00:33:32.840]  Because you cannot create a vaccine for the common cold.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.961]  They actually said that.
[00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:41.726]  They said you should just get herd immunity and that there is no vaccine because of mutations and that this would basically be a fraud.
[00:33:42.686 --> 00:33:48.230]  You can go read the article in Forbes from back in January of this year.
[00:33:49.531 --> 00:33:56.696]  Merck pulls the plug on COVID-19 vaccine program after disappointing trial data.
[00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.971]  When you read their full statement, it tells you everything you need to know.
[00:34:02.051 --> 00:34:11.533]  So why on this live Sunday show, the Alex Jones broadcast with Owen Schroeder and others, why am I focusing back on something from January?
[00:34:12.954 --> 00:34:22.796]  Because now if you look at the maps put out by the CDC and by the UN of the world, by now they wanted half the population of the planet vaccinated.
[00:34:23.757 --> 00:34:25.337]  And they have enough vaccine to already do that.
[00:34:26.718 --> 00:34:29.339]  But the highest level countries are only at 15%.
[00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:33.320]  And that, of course, is the United States, because we're so brainwashed.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.200]  Japan is at less than 5%.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.661]  And so are most other nations, because people know this is experimental.
[00:34:41.762 --> 00:34:43.882]  They know that they skipped the animal trials.
[00:34:45.262 --> 00:34:47.763]  And they read about all the death and destruction that's taking place.
[00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:54.985]  Remember two months ago when India banned the Pfizer shot and said, it's very dangerous.
[00:34:55.025 --> 00:34:55.725]  It's killing people.
[00:34:56.834 --> 00:34:59.376]  They're doing unauthorized trials here.
[00:34:59.916 --> 00:35:00.997]  This is criminal.
[00:35:02.237 --> 00:35:07.721]  Remember that they had NewsGuard, owned by Bill Gates, come out and fact-check me and say that it wasn't true.
[00:35:08.461 --> 00:35:09.342]  But of course it was true.
[00:35:10.363 --> 00:35:14.145]  Well now, the other five vaccines have been banned in different parts of the world.
[00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:15.286]  All over the world.
[00:35:15.826 --> 00:35:17.828]  And so think about the victory we've had.
[00:35:17.848 --> 00:35:20.209]  They're trying to act like, oh, everybody loves vaccines.
[00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:21.730]  They're 100% safe and effective.
[00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.671]  There's no issues.
[00:35:23.669 --> 00:35:41.057]  Don't listen to conspiracy theorists, when all the top scientists, I mean thousands of them, and epidemiologists, and virologists, and the head of the EU advisory board, Wolfgang Wudard, and the former head scientist at Pfizer, all come out and say, this is depopulation.
[00:35:42.452 --> 00:35:43.772]  This is to cause infertility.
[00:35:43.812 --> 00:35:45.413]  This is going to attack women's uteruses.
[00:35:45.613 --> 00:35:47.633]  Back in December they said that and now the data is clear.
[00:35:47.793 --> 00:35:48.253]  They're right.
[00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:52.854]  It's doing exactly that because they can look at something and see what it's really designed to do.
[00:35:53.674 --> 00:36:00.756]  So when you hear this thing doesn't work for COVID or work for a cold and that's why people get reinfected, that's only part of the fraud.
[00:36:01.536 --> 00:36:08.577]  It does work on attacking proteins in your brain, in the placenta, in the uterus, in the ovaries, and in the testicles and other areas.
[00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:12.058]  And this is a bold bioweapon attack.
[00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:14.169]  And yes, it's shedding.
[00:36:15.009 --> 00:36:31.622]  And yes, even NPR had to admit that one concern about the mRNA vaccines and others, the virus vector vaccines of JJ and AstraZeneca, is that it goes into the cells using another virus to deliver the system and will create viral shedding of real super strengths.
[00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:35.145]  But we have something God gave us called the immune system.
[00:36:35.185 --> 00:36:40.849]  So you notice when I was talking about vitamin D and vitamin C and zinc over a year ago, the media is like, that's kooky.
[00:36:40.929 --> 00:36:42.531]  The UN says that's not needed.
[00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:45.059]  They're saying water is not needed, or oxygen.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:54.481]  You now notice, you turn on TV, all you see is vitamin D3 ads, zinc ads, and vitamin C ads, multivitamin ads.
[00:36:54.701 --> 00:36:55.142]  That's great!
[00:36:55.582 --> 00:36:57.322]  Humanity is waking up!
[00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:10.845]  Humanity is waking up to the fact that we can battle these monsters with the simple things that are essential that God gave us, and that their giant hoax of evil is in deep trouble.
[00:37:11.869 --> 00:37:13.850]  They're going to keep leveraging their vaccine passports.
[00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.612]  They've got a big useful idiot population here in the west will go along with it.
[00:37:16.632 --> 00:37:17.693]  They're going to keep trying to make us wear masks.
[00:37:17.753 --> 00:37:21.975]  They're going to keep pecking at us and trying to dominate us, bringing in their mark of the beast, cashless society.
[00:37:22.876 --> 00:37:29.219]  But the good news at the end of the day is the wheels have come off this thing at every level.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.461]  And it's very, very sad.
[00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:36.004]  How many people have had to die like Hank Aaron and marvelous Marvin Hagler and
[00:37:36.872 --> 00:37:38.854]  How many people had to get deathly sick like Ben Stein?
[00:37:39.294 --> 00:37:41.396]  You need to see the article on Infowars.com.
[00:37:41.557 --> 00:37:45.220]  The top actor in India.
[00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:47.723]  The national health spokesperson.
[00:37:48.223 --> 00:37:50.866]  I mean, the guy is like, they're Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:37:51.326 --> 00:37:52.407]  They're Brad Pitt.
[00:37:53.308 --> 00:37:56.051]  He took the shot and one day later died of a heart attack.
[00:37:56.992 --> 00:37:59.954]  Because it's even in the inserts that these shots can cause an autoimmune
[00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:01.372]  I don't know.
[00:38:27.267 --> 00:38:34.991]  And this is designed to go after strands of viruses of RNA, not even full strands, that it's going to cause an autoimmune response and have you attack your own body.
[00:38:35.851 --> 00:38:36.271]  You understand?
[00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:37.512]  That's what the top scientists are saying.
[00:38:37.552 --> 00:38:44.315]  A massive autoimmune response in your own body, where your body attacks itself, or you have an allergic response and your body swells up.
[00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:53.300]  And so, it's very, very sad this is happening, but the good news is, despite big tech censorship, despite all the things they've been doing, the truth is getting out.
[00:38:54.830 --> 00:39:00.272]  Now, Big Tech is responsible for this, not just for censorship, but for being some of the main owners of Big Pharma.
[00:39:01.033 --> 00:39:02.333]  So they got together with this.
[00:39:02.493 --> 00:39:05.755]  They couldn't get mRNA technologies authorized last decade.
[00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:08.936]  No government would legalize them because they're so dangerous.
[00:39:10.296 --> 00:39:11.417]  And so what do these monsters do?
[00:39:12.912 --> 00:39:25.795]  They got together with Big Tech, they got together with the UN, they got together with Bill Gates, and all the major health groups in the world that his foundation publicly finances, except for the 32 countries he's been thrown out of, like India, which still had over 130 countries on its payroll.
[00:39:26.515 --> 00:39:35.998]  They decided to get together with one script, to stay safe and effective, to say it was tested, to say it was great, and to say you'd have to take it to buy and sell or have a job or get on an airplane or leave your house.
[00:39:36.857 --> 00:39:51.710]  And with huge bullying, and huge lying, and huge corruption, huge fear-mongering, and exaggerating COVID-19 deaths to 101, and counting all the other deaths as COVID-19, and sending sick people to nursing homes to hopefully get the death numbers up, and committing every crime you can imagine, and then some.
[00:39:53.328 --> 00:40:01.312]  Now their whole hoax is falling apart and the whole world is turning against them, and they're all over the news saying, it's crazy, people are refusing en masse, they're evil, they won't take the shots.
[00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:07.436]  That's right, because the majority of people know you're a group of murdering, corrupt, globalist corporations who don't just want money and power.
[00:40:07.456 --> 00:40:13.379]  You want to be able to test on us like guinea pigs, and you want to be able to depopulate us and play God because you think we're stupid.
[00:40:13.759 --> 00:40:16.281]  And this whole thing was a giant IQ test in your own words.
[00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:16.761]  Well, guess what?
[00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:18.402]  We're passing the IQ test.
[00:40:18.942 --> 00:40:22.728]  And we're recognizing that you're a bunch of exterminist monsters that are going to have to be dealt with.
[00:40:23.168 --> 00:40:27.915]  And that you are committing crimes against humanity and violating the Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Convention.
[00:40:28.637 --> 00:40:30.079]  And that you will be held accountable.
[00:40:32.236 --> 00:40:32.997]  So help me God.
[00:40:33.938 --> 00:40:36.060]  So back to Owen Schroeder and the live broadcast.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.502]  I'll be back in studio tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:40:38.622 --> 00:40:38.983]  Central.
[00:40:39.643 --> 00:40:40.825]  Thank you for keeping us on the air.
[00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:46.390]  Without your support of InfoWars, there's no way humanity would have woken up to this as fast as we did.
[00:40:47.431 --> 00:40:49.293]  All of you have been instrumental in this fight.
[00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:52.196]  I know it's been negative, it's been painful, it's been scary, it's been frustrating.
[00:40:52.496 --> 00:40:54.218]  It's put a lot of years on me, I can tell you that.
[00:40:56.522 --> 00:40:59.343]  Months ago, God touched my heart and said, Relax, Jones.
[00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:00.884]  Just do the right thing.
[00:41:01.044 --> 00:41:02.225]  I'll carry us the rest of the way.
[00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:04.106]  I've had a lot more peace since then.
[00:41:04.606 --> 00:41:05.807]  I'm getting a lot more peace now.
[00:41:05.827 --> 00:41:09.248]  As long as we speak out and take action, God will do the rest.
[00:41:09.308 --> 00:41:10.869]  It's hard to watch these monsters do this.
[00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:14.491]  It's hard to watch them carry all this out.
[00:41:15.774 --> 00:41:18.676]  But together, again, if we do the right thing, we will defeat them.
[00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:27.443]  But now when you start talking about holding them accountable for all the deaths and all the illnesses, Europe's saying that they're going to waive the law now that lawsuits go forward against vaccine makers.
[00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:33.929]  How about criminal charges like happened to Merck, when they normally put HIV and hepatitis in the blood in the Factor VIII scandal?
[00:41:34.704 --> 00:41:36.104]  We need criminal charges.
[00:41:36.444 --> 00:41:39.785]  We need demonstrations outside Bill Gates' house and Microsoft.
[00:41:39.845 --> 00:41:45.806]  We need those outside Google for covering up all the medical scientists and the doctors that warned us.
[00:41:46.406 --> 00:41:48.287]  These are complicit mad scientists.
[00:41:48.427 --> 00:41:51.847]  They're not just liberals now censoring people, you know, the evil conservatives.
[00:41:52.127 --> 00:41:54.268]  You're now helping Big Pharma poison the planet.
[00:41:54.668 --> 00:41:55.428]  You're monsters.
[00:41:56.048 --> 00:41:57.248]  This isn't left versus right.
[00:41:57.268 --> 00:41:58.569]  This is human versus tyranny.
[00:41:59.109 --> 00:42:00.429]  And people are coming together.
[00:42:01.129 --> 00:42:05.171]  You know, they're using that in the news saying, Trump supporters are the most vaccine hesitant.
[00:42:06.092 --> 00:42:11.635]  That's why we need to educate them to trick liberals to go, oh, if Trump supporters are against it, I'm for it.
[00:42:12.035 --> 00:42:19.279]  When statistically, it's highly educated liberals with degrees that are refusing the vaccines.
[00:42:19.819 --> 00:42:21.120]  And then of course conservatives after that.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.782]  I mean, look at the main anti-vax movement are a bunch of scientists and liberals.
[00:42:25.302 --> 00:42:26.543]  So again, this isn't working.
[00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:28.044]  People are coming together.
[00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:31.804]  It's very, very exciting, and we just got to keep getting the word out.
[00:42:31.844 --> 00:42:36.569]  So folks, don't just go to sleep when they back off these lockdowns and stuff, because we're going to bring them right back.
[00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.035]  You've got to fully route out and fully expose the entire false paradigm, the entire false lie.
[00:42:42.055 --> 00:42:42.776]  All right.
[00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:46.020]  Owen Schroeder and our number two are coming up.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.027]  On the Sunday, Alex Jones Show and then Sunday Live that Owen hosts coming up for two hours.
[00:42:51.508 --> 00:42:52.950]  After that, we're gonna go to break.
[00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.571]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:53.611 --> 00:42:55.154]  Please, everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:42:55.494 --> 00:42:57.878]  History is happening, but without you, the enemy will win.
[00:42:57.938 --> 00:42:59.541]  With you, we will have victory.
[00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:00.963]  God bless and good luck.
[00:43:00.983 --> 00:43:01.364]  Stay with us.
[00:43:14.898 --> 00:43:16.842]  We hope you're having a good weekend out there.
[00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:24.255]  Everybody tuned in to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday.
[00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:26.649]  We thank you for tuning in.
[00:43:26.689 --> 00:43:28.790]  We thank you for supporting us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.231]  Owen Troyer here for another hour.
[00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:34.793]  And then I hand the baton to Harrison Smith, who will be hosting Sunday Night Live.
[00:43:34.833 --> 00:43:37.014]  Laura Loomer has stuck around.
[00:43:37.094 --> 00:43:42.576]  I wanted her to come back and again talk about the event coming up this week, just so people tuned in.
[00:43:42.596 --> 00:43:45.317]  A lot of Patriots in Florida, very active as well.
[00:43:45.657 --> 00:43:50.479]  So Laura, once again, tell people about the event coming up on Tuesday and any details you think they might need to know.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.480]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:59.582]  And so, the event is going to be Tuesday from 4.30 to 6.30 in Palm Beach at a place called Trump Corner, where we have a lot of Trump events.
[00:43:59.642 --> 00:44:04.163]  And so, the information is on my Gap, the flyer's on my Parler, it's also on my Telegram.
[00:44:04.223 --> 00:44:06.223]  I just posted it a couple hours ago.
[00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:11.805]  And Michelle Malkin's going to be there, Nick Fuentes, Lauren Witzke, Vincent James.
[00:44:11.945 --> 00:44:21.247]  And we're going to have a really big rally to let people know that if the legislator here in Florida doesn't get it together and include these amendments in this bill, this big tech bill,
[00:44:21.927 --> 00:44:32.809]  HB 7013 or Senate Bill 7072, the Senate companion bill, then we're not going to have an effective tech bill here in Florida.
[00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:37.410]  And candidates like myself and Donald Trump and others will be deplatformed.
[00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:39.310]  And it's not just about me, right?
[00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.691]  This is about every candidate running for office in the state of Florida.
[00:44:43.031 --> 00:44:50.772]  And I'll tell you right now, big tech social media censorship is without a doubt the most important issue in the country right now, if not the entire world.
[00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:58.681]  And if we don't start finding solutions to rein in big tech and get rid of big tech tyranny, no Republicans will ever be elected ever again.
[00:44:59.021 --> 00:45:00.323]  They're just never going to allow it.
[00:45:00.363 --> 00:45:02.565]  We saw what big tech did this last election cycle.
[00:45:02.585 --> 00:45:06.130]  They colluded, just as people like you and I and Alex have been saying they would for years.
[00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.813]  They colluded with each other to steal the election.
[00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:25.397]  Laura, what do you make, speaking of stealing elections, what do you make of the audit happening in Arizona right now, where the Democrats are sending dozens, 73 attorneys down there, to try to muddy the waters with that, but the audit continues.
[00:45:25.677 --> 00:45:26.978]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:45:27.018 --> 00:45:27.938]  What are you seeing down there?
[00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:30.639]  Well, I think it's really interesting.
[00:45:30.699 --> 00:45:36.522]  If you didn't steal an election and there's no voter fraud, why do you have to send attorneys if people just want to recount ballots?
[00:45:37.182 --> 00:45:38.623]  What's the problem, right?
[00:45:39.926 --> 00:45:42.047]  You think the Democrats are acting suspiciously?
[00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:53.610]  Well, look, real winners, when you're a winner, when you really win an election or you win any type of tournament or anything, right?
[00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:58.091]  Whenever you're a winner, you don't have to silence your opposition if you won fair and square.
[00:45:58.211 --> 00:46:06.833]  If you're a real winner, you don't have to intimidate others and threaten others with litigation if you really are a real winner and you didn't cheat and you didn't steal.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.901]  That's interesting.
[00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:26.152]  The Democrats have to censor all their opposition, and then they have to cheat to win elections, and then they pretend they're the popular party with all their Hollywood minions and their mainstream media towing the party line, giving the narrative to them as well.
[00:46:26.733 --> 00:46:29.275]  It's very incredible stuff to witness this.
[00:46:30.015 --> 00:46:45.662]  I was at Mar-a-Lago last night and I was there for the House Freedom Fund fundraiser with members of the Freedom Caucus and President Trump was talking about voter fraud and he was talking about how Republicans, you know, really need to start fighting back and that he said that this is the most important issue as well.
[00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:52.425]  And President Trump at Mar-a-Lago during his speech last night also talked about big tech censorship and how important it is that we get a hold on that.
[00:46:52.945 --> 00:47:07.428]  And I actually had an opportunity to speak with President Trump about the big tech social media censorship and what I've been doing to combat this last week when I was at Mar-a-Lago as well and I'm looking forward to having a meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in the near future to discuss this because
[00:47:08.175 --> 00:47:13.519]  Look, the Democrats are colluding openly with Big Tech to silence people.
[00:47:13.579 --> 00:47:18.922]  And I do believe that voter fraud and the voter integrity issue and Big Tech censorship are all one and the same issue.
[00:47:19.243 --> 00:47:24.486]  Because when you look at the people who are financing the voter fraud, it's people like Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[00:47:24.506 --> 00:47:29.549]  The $400 million in election operations for ballot boxes.
[00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:37.495]  So if we don't deal with the Big Tech social media tyrants, then we're not going to get a hold on voter fraud or voter irregularities.
[00:47:38.996 --> 00:47:45.059]  That's Laura Loomer, follower on Gab, on Parler, on Telegram, and see her in Florida on Tuesday.
[00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:45.760]  Laura, thank you.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:52.344]  Thanks, and hopefully InfoWars can come out as well, because we'd love to have InfoWars there live-streaming the event.
[00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:54.785]  You just had to do it to us, didn't you?
[00:47:55.066 --> 00:47:58.188]  You just had to put the pressure on me, live on air, the pressure cooker.
[00:47:58.328 --> 00:47:58.668]  I get it.
[00:48:07.396 --> 00:48:13.860]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[00:48:58.639 --> 00:49:04.582]  I'm going to be like the Clintons in the White House and slink off from work today with a bottle of Vezo Beet Complete.

[00:50:01.889 --> 00:50:04.169]  I want to show a couple things here.
[00:50:04.229 --> 00:50:08.630]  First of all, we all know about what happened with the girl there in Columbus.
[00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.271]  And you know, everything is so polarized, but
[00:50:13.584 --> 00:50:16.667]  You see all these people coming out and her mother saying, oh, she was such a sweet girl.
[00:50:17.227 --> 00:50:20.650]  And Makiya Bryant, the one that got shot when she was trying to stab a girl to death.
[00:50:21.591 --> 00:50:23.572]  And people are going and looking at her TikTok videos.
[00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:24.733]  Oh, she was the sweetest thing.
[00:50:24.953 --> 00:50:25.334]  You know what?
[00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:27.836]  Maybe 99.9% of her life, she was.
[00:50:28.576 --> 00:50:29.437]  Maybe she really was.
[00:50:29.497 --> 00:50:30.638]  Maybe she really was a sweetheart.
[00:50:30.658 --> 00:50:33.500]  But you know, in that moment, she was trying to stab a girl to death.
[00:50:34.021 --> 00:50:39.205]  And sometimes when you make a mistake like that, it ruins or even ends your life.
[00:50:39.405 --> 00:50:40.226]  And so it's sad.
[00:50:40.306 --> 00:50:42.348]  Nobody wants her to get shot and killed that day.
[00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:45.231]  But nobody wants to be stabbed to death either.
[00:50:46.472 --> 00:50:47.573]  And so that was the situation.
[00:50:47.613 --> 00:50:51.215]  But so, now, this is the new thing.
[00:50:51.235 --> 00:50:53.337]  They still do the hands up, don't shoot with Mike Brown.
[00:50:53.357 --> 00:50:55.018]  They do the I can't breathe with George Floyd.
[00:50:55.498 --> 00:50:58.841]  Now they're gonna say, you're gonna shoot me like Makia Bryant.
[00:50:58.861 --> 00:51:10.349]  Here's a exchange between an officer and some civilians, where they try to poke at the officer, instigate the officer, saying you're gonna kill me like Makia Bryant, and listen to the officer's response.
[00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:13.860]  Are y'all gonna kill me like Ma'Khia Bryant?
[00:51:14.361 --> 00:51:14.661]  Fuck.
[00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:15.902]  Are you gonna stab somebody like her?
[00:51:16.162 --> 00:51:18.063]  No, she- but she called y'all for help!
[00:51:18.183 --> 00:51:19.464]  Fuck is you talking about?
[00:51:19.504 --> 00:51:22.346]  Get your goofy ass- I can't- So, so there you go.
[00:51:22.386 --> 00:51:24.107]  We'll have to, uh, we'll have to drop that there.
[00:51:24.127 --> 00:51:26.369]  Should, uh, we apologize for the curse words getting out.
[00:51:27.029 --> 00:51:29.731]  Uh, but yeah, so, oh, you're gonna stab- you're gonna shoot me like Ma'Khia Bryant?
[00:51:30.071 --> 00:51:31.612]  I'm glad the officer stood up for himself.
[00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:32.853]  I'm glad the officer responded.
[00:51:32.873 --> 00:51:41.799]  And you know, it must be tough for officers these days to have to put up with all the BS and the hatred and having a target on their back, and they can't even stand up for themselves.
[00:51:43.482 --> 00:51:47.505]  And so good for that officer for at least kind of standing up for himself a little bit there.
[00:51:48.265 --> 00:51:56.310]  But it's sad what they're going to have to deal with because of the mainstream media and the Democrat Party's demonizing them and putting a target on their back.
[00:51:56.811 --> 00:52:00.273]  And again, you notice how the individual talking to the officer doesn't even know the story.
[00:52:01.094 --> 00:52:03.475]  Makia Bryant did not call the police.
[00:52:05.396 --> 00:52:12.061]  She had the police called on her or whatever group she was with that was starting a fight in the neighborhood.
[00:52:13.544 --> 00:52:24.506]  No, it was the girl standing there holding her dog with her family and her neighbors that called the cops because Makia Bryant and her friends were out of control and she said she was going to go on a stabbing spree.
[00:52:25.006 --> 00:52:26.627]  And she had a knife on her.
[00:52:28.647 --> 00:52:30.788]  And she's so out of control in this video.
[00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:34.669]  You know, and again, nobody even wants to be honest about what they see in this video.
[00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:41.370]  Makia Bryant's, the other guy she was with, tried to curb stomp a woman into the pavement.
[00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:47.130]  Literally, she tried to curb stomp a woman's head into the pavement.
[00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.291]  Nobody seems to have a problem with that.
[00:52:49.031 --> 00:52:53.294]  Makia was also running around wildly swinging a knife.
[00:52:55.015 --> 00:53:03.201]  And so she gets into a scruffle with one person, you see there, she's in a scruffle with one person, the lady in the pink doesn't even do anything, and then she just gets up and she starts wildly swinging at her.
[00:53:05.014 --> 00:53:17.678]  So again, nobody wants to see anybody get shot by police, but when you go around swinging a knife at people, somebody's hopefully going to stop you.
[00:53:17.738 --> 00:53:21.799]  Now, here is Officer Tatum, Brandon Tatum, a beautiful segment.
[00:53:21.819 --> 00:53:23.820]  He goes off on the BBC network.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.141]  It's good to have voices like Brandon Tatum out there.
[00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:27.541]  Here it is.
[00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:36.819]  Right, we can speak now to Brandon Tatum, a former police officer and founder and CEO of the Officer Tatum.
[00:53:36.859 --> 00:53:38.121]  Thank you very much for coming on the programme.
[00:53:39.422 --> 00:53:39.862]  My pleasure.
[00:53:40.143 --> 00:53:46.009]  So we're going to talk about lots of the wider issues just in a moment, but first of all just wanted to get your reaction to the conviction.
[00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:54.378]  Well, first of all, I think most of what I heard on the broadcast all the way here is confusing to me.
[00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:56.759]  I think we're living in the twilight zone.
[00:53:56.999 --> 00:54:00.621]  This conviction, in my personal opinion, did nothing for our country.
[00:54:00.681 --> 00:54:02.401]  I mean, people are living a lie.
[00:54:02.902 --> 00:54:05.963]  I mean, this is one police officer, one person in the community,
[00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:07.751]  They found him guilty.
[00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.173]  This was the swiftest justice I've ever seen in my life.
[00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.696]  The day after the film came out, he was arrested.
[00:54:13.396 --> 00:54:14.077]  He was tried.
[00:54:14.537 --> 00:54:16.399]  Ten hours of deliberation, he was convicted.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.443]  I'm not really sure why people are acting like this is monumental.
[00:54:21.944 --> 00:54:25.127]  Also, he did not get a fair trial, in my personal opinion.
[00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:27.109]  There was a lot of obstruction that happened.
[00:54:27.149 --> 00:54:30.612]  They paid the family out $27 million before the jury could be selected.
[00:54:30.912 --> 00:54:32.794]  I mean, they're going to have a case and appeal.
[00:54:33.334 --> 00:54:40.416]  So I don't know why people are celebrating and I don't know why this is such a big focal point other than people are making money off of the pain of people in our country.
[00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:59.262]  So you're objecting firstly to some of the things that happened around the trial which now that there is a conviction I think we should probably park that but secondly you're upset that there's a amalgamation here of a wider sense of a landmark case and this one specific court case.
[00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.777]  Yeah, this is not a landmark case.
[00:55:02.837 --> 00:55:05.158]  I think people are, this is a political agenda.
[00:55:05.478 --> 00:55:07.119]  They're pushing lies in our country.
[00:55:07.459 --> 00:55:09.619]  Policing in America is not inherently racist.
[00:55:09.759 --> 00:55:11.200]  We don't live in a racist country.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:18.602]  This was an interaction between a police officer that I thought did the wrong thing and a black man who was on drugs, high, resisting arrest.
[00:55:18.942 --> 00:55:23.265]  So you reject President Biden's comments about systemic racism and it being a stain on the whole nation?
[00:55:43.348 --> 00:55:49.033]  Yes, President Biden is an idiot in my personal opinion, and he's just talking because he's a politician.
[00:55:49.434 --> 00:55:50.495]  Systemic racism.
[00:55:50.675 --> 00:55:57.181]  I mean, if you look at Joe Biden himself, you know, he spoke at a Ku Klux Klan member's funeral and did the eulogy.
[00:55:57.933 --> 00:55:58.593]  We're good to go.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.002]  We don't have a problem with racism in our country.
[00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:20.964]  We have a problem with people not following the law.
[00:56:21.264 --> 00:56:24.967]  We also have a problem with politicians making up things so they can get re-elected.
[00:56:25.247 --> 00:56:26.769]  And that's exactly what has been happening.
[00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:28.610]  That's why you never see anything change.
[00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:29.851]  They're lying to us.
[00:56:30.231 --> 00:56:39.798]  So the rate of people being killed by police is, the rate is higher amongst black people than amongst the rest of the population.
[00:56:40.299 --> 00:56:44.262]  What do you, how do you account for that if that isn't a systemic racism problem?
[00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:46.502]  Yeah, first of all, that's not true.
[00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:49.264]  Twice as many white people get killed by police every year.
[00:56:49.384 --> 00:56:51.846]  Twice as many white people get killed unarmed by police every year.
[00:56:51.866 --> 00:56:52.627]  You just don't see it.
[00:56:53.007 --> 00:56:54.528]  There's a gentleman named Tony Tempah.
[00:56:54.768 --> 00:56:57.991]  I guarantee you anybody watching me have no idea who Tony Tempah is.
[00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:01.854]  Tony Tempah was murdered in the same fashion that George Floyd was killed.
[00:57:02.194 --> 00:57:05.737]  But because he was white, we don't hear about it and nobody cares about it.
[00:57:05.777 --> 00:57:08.939]  Nobody's talking about police reform when he was suffocated and killed.
[00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:11.401]  But they only talk about it because George Floyd is black.
[00:57:11.781 --> 00:57:16.908]  Black people commit over half of violent crimes in this country and only make up 13% of the population.
[00:57:17.468 --> 00:57:22.194]  They commit over half of the murders in this country, but only make up 13% of the population.
[00:57:22.274 --> 00:57:25.478]  And we can agree that 13% of the population aren't the criminals.
[00:57:25.699 --> 00:57:28.242]  There's only a small fraction of the black community that's doing this.
[00:57:28.602 --> 00:57:33.926]  So that explains why police are in the black communities more, and that explains why black people are incarcerated more.
[00:57:34.287 --> 00:57:37.769]  They are making up lies saying that it has anything to do with racism.
[00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:42.773]  Do you understand that there's black police officers, too, that patrol in many of these majority black cities?
[00:57:43.113 --> 00:57:43.874]  Are they racist?
[00:57:44.414 --> 00:57:45.355]  No, that's not the case.
[00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:55.543]  They're just making these things up, in my personal opinion, and they're riding a wave of dead black people in order to make money and be politically, um, and get political leverage.
[00:57:56.223 --> 00:57:57.705]  How do you like those
[00:57:58.994 --> 00:58:01.015]  Astronomically high gas prices.
[00:58:01.035 --> 00:58:02.136]  You can thank Joe Biden for that.
[00:58:03.677 --> 00:58:09.120]  And soon, the cost of a cheeseburger will be astronomically high as well.
[00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:11.422]  Welcome back into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:11.442 --> 00:58:12.242]  Owen Schroer here.
[00:58:12.282 --> 00:58:13.443]  I'm gonna do a news blitz.
[00:58:13.463 --> 00:58:16.205]  If I can get through all the news in this segment, I'll open up the phone lines.
[00:58:17.586 --> 00:58:26.051]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden, of course, at the behest of China,
[00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:36.338]  At the behest of the new world order that doesn't want you to be free and prosperous and eat red meat.
[00:58:37.879 --> 00:58:52.652]  According to a study done at the University of Michigan, Joe Biden's climate plan would force Americans to reduce their red meat consumption by 90%, meaning that they can only consume four pounds of red meat per year or one burger a month.
[00:58:53.933 --> 00:58:53.993]  Uh,
[00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:57.748]  That wouldn't really be the equivalent for me.
[00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:00.331]  I like big cheeseburgers.
[00:59:02.172 --> 00:59:07.837]  Of course, the irony is, remember, Joe Biden had the president of Japan over for a cheeseburger dinner.
[00:59:08.838 --> 00:59:09.558]  Remember that one?
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:17.425]  And just two years ago, or three years ago now, excuse me, on Politico,
[00:59:18.882 --> 00:59:20.803]  Remember the old story they made fun of us saying?
[00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.444]  We're not coming for your cheeseburgers.
[00:59:22.885 --> 00:59:23.305]  The headline?
[00:59:23.745 --> 00:59:26.748]  Why right-ringers are going crazy about meat.
[00:59:27.548 --> 00:59:32.291]  Conservatives are panicked that liberals are going to take away their steaks after grabbing guns.
[00:59:32.351 --> 00:59:35.374]  The fear is pushing people to absurd lengths to prove how free they are.
[00:59:35.954 --> 00:59:40.077]  Except now here you are coming for our guns and our red meat.
[00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:46.942]  So your gas prices go up, your cheeseburger prices go up, your lumber prices go up, your energy prices go up.
[00:59:47.522 --> 00:59:53.126]  All thanks to Biden capitulating to the new world order where the United States is not allowed to be free and prosperous.
[00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:54.987]  We're not allowed to have a free market.
[00:59:56.983 --> 00:59:58.225]  And that's really all it is.
[00:59:58.905 --> 01:00:00.187]  They want a global government.
[01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:03.370]  You cannot have a free market.
[01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:06.654]  You cannot have a prosperous, dominant United States of America.
[01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:08.015]  You cannot have that.
[01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:11.960]  That then leads the world, and then you don't get a global government.
[01:00:12.721 --> 01:00:13.582]  Because the very
[01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:20.150]  Principles of the United States of American government political system is small government.
[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.733]  We've lost our way, but small government.
[01:00:23.473 --> 01:00:24.695]  Self-government.
[01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:28.499]  That revolutionary idea that the Democrats hate so much.
[01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:30.681]  Self-government.
[01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.184]  Self-government.
[01:00:34.165 --> 01:00:36.868]  And so, here's what it's going to look like.
[01:00:39.255 --> 01:00:42.617]  In Los Angeles they have just built a homeless encampment.
[01:00:42.657 --> 01:00:44.599]  Now you've seen the tent cities popping up.
[01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:49.642]  You've even seen now government subsidized tent cities in places like Portland.
[01:00:50.423 --> 01:00:51.984]  Now it's gone next level.
[01:00:52.484 --> 01:01:00.009]  A large homeless encampment along the 101 freeway in North Hollywood is now a colorful village of tiny homes for the homeless.
[01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:04.492]  So they get these tiny homes constructed for them.
[01:01:05.473 --> 01:01:09.116]  They get government subsidized hotel rooms paid for by them.
[01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:13.739]  By the way, we also have to pay for the illegal immigrants as well.
[01:01:14.639 --> 01:01:16.601]  This is a socialist country now, you see?
[01:01:17.221 --> 01:01:18.822]  This is a socialist country now.
[01:01:19.463 --> 01:01:22.725]  And so that's what it looks like under Agenda 21.
[01:01:23.866 --> 01:01:26.608]  So this story was from January 9th, 2015.
[01:01:26.648 --> 01:01:32.312]  The headline, Agenda 21 is real, far creepier than Area 51, and it's coming soon to a suburb near you.
[01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:33.473]  This is it.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.020]  This is it.
[01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:41.243]  Government lockdowns, open borders, homeless encampments.
[01:01:42.723 --> 01:01:43.204]  All over.
[01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.624]  Because you'll be homeless too.
[01:01:45.385 --> 01:01:46.385]  You'll own nothing.
[01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:47.505]  The New World Order tells you.
[01:01:47.545 --> 01:01:49.206]  You'll be a slave, but you'll like it.
[01:01:52.527 --> 01:01:53.608]  Replacement migration.
[01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:57.650]  Biden administration to increase number of illegals released into the United States by 800%.
[01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.991]  Of course, that's just the numbers that we know of.
[01:02:02.278 --> 01:02:06.741]  That doesn't even count the ones that don't get caught and processed.
[01:02:07.101 --> 01:02:14.346]  And then they'll end up in, many of them in the cities like that one in L.A., the homeless facilities.
[01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:19.790]  The Democrat Party's gone full racist, by the way, in case you haven't noticed.
[01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:20.850]  They've gone full racist now.
[01:02:21.651 --> 01:02:22.932]  They aren't even hiding their racism.
[01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:25.614]  And they like Jim Crow laws.
[01:02:25.634 --> 01:02:29.756]  Of course, it was the Democrats that wrote the Jim Crow laws, so they're bringing Jim Crow laws back.
[01:02:29.816 --> 01:02:30.657]  That's the Democrat Party.
[01:02:31.077 --> 01:02:31.798]  This is seen...
[01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:43.363]  At the Madison Metropolitan School District, this is in Wisconsin, they had a Zoom meeting for parents, okay?
[01:02:44.324 --> 01:02:46.406]  And at the bottom here, they have links.
[01:02:46.666 --> 01:02:48.407]  You click the link, you go to the Zoom meeting.
[01:02:48.427 --> 01:02:49.388]  They had two different links!
[01:02:49.608 --> 01:02:50.909]  You think, two different links?
[01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:52.070]  Well, one link should be fine.
[01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:53.611]  No, see, two different links!
[01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:59.455]  Zoom link for parents of color, and Zoom link for white parents.
[01:03:00.336 --> 01:03:02.258]  I used to read books about this stuff.
[01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:11.640]  For whites only, or at the time they had the colored people water fountains.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.441]  Remember that?
[01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:15.143]  The Democrats did that with Jim Crow laws.
[01:03:15.163 --> 01:03:15.643]  They wrote those.
[01:03:16.144 --> 01:03:19.366]  The Democrats founded by the leftovers of the KKK.
[01:03:20.688 --> 01:03:26.893]  Now they're bringing it back, folks, and they have separate Zoom meetings for parents of color and for white parents.
[01:03:29.229 --> 01:03:39.716]  Now see, if they would be honest about this, they'd just say, no, we want to be racist against white people because there was racism against black people in America, so now we're just going to be racist against white people.
[01:03:39.756 --> 01:03:44.579]  Of course, that's the complete opposite of what Martin Luther King's dream was, but that's what they really are doing.
[01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:48.322]  That's what they're really doing.
[01:03:48.602 --> 01:03:49.543]  And they're not the only people.
[01:03:50.930 --> 01:04:02.735]  There's a month-old headline that just covers the story of universities posting different graduation ceremonies for gay people and different skin colors and income levels and all this.
[01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:04.756]  So this is the left, okay?
[01:04:05.116 --> 01:04:10.779]  This is the segregationist movement, once again brought on by the left, the Democrats.
[01:04:11.219 --> 01:04:15.481]  Here's the leading newspaper of the left, New York Times.
[01:04:15.621 --> 01:04:17.302]  Whiteness is a suicide cult.
[01:04:17.442 --> 01:04:19.083]  Blackness is a superpower.
[01:04:21.852 --> 01:04:26.375]  That is a literal headline from the New York Times.
[01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:28.236]  So, there you go.
[01:04:28.676 --> 01:04:29.857]  Again, who are the real racists?
[01:04:31.198 --> 01:04:32.419]  They don't even see their own irony.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:39.083]  Black-owned businesses in George Floyd Square say they are in desperate need of help from the police.
[01:04:39.664 --> 01:04:42.846]  The businesses are struggling to stay open due to rampant crime.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.384]  So you have white liberals that are racist that are out there with Black Lives Matter.
[01:04:49.865 --> 01:04:58.632]  Then you have black criminals that are just criminals who are robbing and looting businesses in the name and the cover of Black Lives Matter.
[01:04:59.533 --> 01:05:02.135]  And it's black business owners that are suffering the most from it.
[01:05:02.195 --> 01:05:04.937]  In Atlanta where they moved the All-Star game because of racism.
[01:05:06.004 --> 01:05:11.367]  And now in George Floyd Square, where white people, you know, aren't allowed to talk.
[01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:12.168]  Did you know that?
[01:05:12.788 --> 01:05:15.890]  Yeah, these are the liberal Democrats that are so racist.
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.130]  They have a sign up for white people.
[01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:18.071]  You're not allowed to talk.
[01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:20.452]  And of course, this is all supported by big tech.
[01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:29.858]  Twitter, Facebook, and Netflix moguls have donated seven and a half million dollars to the BLM co-founder who is pushing their net neutrality policy.
[01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:31.158]  So that's how that works.
[01:05:32.264 --> 01:05:38.288]  You know, the Black Lives Matter leaders, not the family of George Floyd or Michael Brown or the others, they're asking where their money is.
[01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:39.929]  The families of Breonna Taylor.
[01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.771]  They're saying, how come BLM scammed us?
[01:05:41.991 --> 01:05:43.011]  They didn't pay us anything.
[01:05:43.612 --> 01:05:44.773]  It's all about free handouts.
[01:05:44.793 --> 01:05:48.936]  That's how a free citizen is getting free handouts from the government that controls you.
[01:05:49.476 --> 01:06:00.824]  And so, they, the BLM founders, quote unquote, they have big luxurious mansions now, and they get paid off to promote
[01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:04.694]  Big tech agendas.
[01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:06.896]  That's how it works.
[01:06:06.936 --> 01:06:10.259]  So they have to pay influencers to promote their big tech agendas.
[01:06:10.279 --> 01:06:15.664]  They have to pay influencers to promote their medical tyranny agendas with the forced vaccines.
[01:06:17.305 --> 01:06:18.727]  That's what these people are into.
[01:06:18.747 --> 01:06:25.453]  I think we'll take some phone calls here as we close out the Alex Jones Show in the next two segments.
[01:06:25.493 --> 01:06:26.674]  I'll open it up on the other side.
[01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:38.828]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:40.249]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:42.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.752 --> 01:06:45.795]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:50.100]  Alright, I'm gonna give out the phone number now.
[01:06:51.402 --> 01:06:53.684]  I've got a couple segments left to take your phone calls.
[01:06:53.704 --> 01:06:53.744]  877-789-2539.
[01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:00.289]  877-789-2539.
[01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:08.472]  I've got two segments left here of the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, then Harrison Smith will be hosting Sunday Night Live.
[01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:11.193]  He doesn't have any guests, so he may be taking calls as well.
[01:07:11.213 --> 01:07:12.754]  I know he's got a lot of news he's going to cover.
[01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:17.976]  But we'll start getting your phone calls lined up here as I finish some of this other news.
[01:07:19.297 --> 01:07:28.460]  Gina Carano, she is the former MMA fighter and she was the actress in the popular show Mandalorian.
[01:07:29.682 --> 01:07:34.204]  It then got removed from her duties because she's not a liberal.
[01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:37.946]  Statement of the day from Gina Carano.
[01:07:38.426 --> 01:07:40.167]  You want to start improving your health?
[01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:44.789]  Stop being so full of she, I, it.
[01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.852]  I think that pretty much sums it up.
[01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:50.312]  You want
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:08:03.535]  To start improving your health, stop being so full of she, I, it, and of course feels like that was directed to the liberal progressive left in this country.
[01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:06.103]  A couple other headlines here.
[01:08:06.543 --> 01:08:12.187]  Trump demands National Guard in Arizona as legal action continues against Maricopa Audit.
[01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:16.951]  Yes, the Democrats doing everything they can to try to stop that audit.
[01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:19.032]  What are they so afraid of?
[01:08:19.353 --> 01:08:23.095]  And of course the viral photos that have people going bananas.
[01:08:24.657 --> 01:08:32.803]  A lot of people wondering if it might have something to do with a certain guest of InfoWars named Steve Pchenik.
[01:08:34.642 --> 01:08:40.705]  And they are doing blacklight scanning of all the ballots.
[01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:44.828]  So is that one way to see what ballots are real and which ones are fake?
[01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.749]  Perhaps time will tell.
[01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:51.331]  Never-before-seen photos show Bill Clinton greeting sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the White House.
[01:08:51.371 --> 01:08:54.133]  And actually, it's not just Clinton greeting Epstein.
[01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:56.754]  Also greeting Maxwell.
[01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:58.675]  That case is ongoing.
[01:08:58.735 --> 01:08:59.976]  New charges have been filed.
[01:09:00.016 --> 01:09:01.096]  Trafficking of minors.
[01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.858]  Again, that's Epstein and Maxwell.
[01:09:05.126 --> 01:09:06.866]  No big media coverage on that, though.
[01:09:07.607 --> 01:09:24.310]  You know, everything's about George Floyd or a police officer, but, you know, the industrial-level sex trafficking, the industrial-level sex abuse that involved presidents of the United States, no big deal because, well, Bill Clinton was a Democrat.
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.991]  So as long as you're a Democrat, you can get away with anything.
[01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:30.491]  Here's another example.
[01:09:32.112 --> 01:09:33.972]  Michigan Democratic Representative
[01:09:35.911 --> 01:09:37.892]  Gets pulled over for drunk driving.
[01:09:37.972 --> 01:09:39.913]  He drove his car into a ditch.
[01:09:40.633 --> 01:09:41.573]  It was that bad.
[01:09:41.633 --> 01:09:45.275]  He drove his car into a ditch, and then he starts threatening the officers!
[01:09:46.595 --> 01:09:49.196]  I'm telling you, it's not going to be good for you.
[01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:51.537]  I run y'all's budget, bro!
[01:09:52.357 --> 01:09:56.399]  Said Jewel Jones, 26 years old, after drunkenly crashing his car into a ditch.
[01:09:57.619 --> 01:10:00.780]  He then threatened to call Governor Whitmer on the cops.
[01:10:01.621 --> 01:10:01.961]  Wow!
[01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.870]  I guess he knows Whitmer's a dirty dealer too.
[01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:12.033]  So threatened to call her to stop himself from getting a DUI and of course was cursing.
[01:10:12.854 --> 01:10:15.415]  Threatening the officers, saying he was going to have them all fired and everything.
[01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:24.280]  It's a better idea to just cooperate with the police when you drive your car into a ditch.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.721]  But see, he's a good Democrat.
[01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:26.942]  He's feeling empowered.
[01:10:29.076 --> 01:10:30.297]  And so he threatens the officers.
[01:10:31.177 --> 01:10:36.199]  Canadian police return with SWAT team to local church run by Arthur Pawlowski.
[01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:44.683]  That was the powerful pastor who told off the health officials multiple times, get out, get out.
[01:10:44.803 --> 01:10:45.844]  You may remember that video.
[01:10:46.584 --> 01:10:55.128]  And so now they show up with SWAT teams because, you know, freedom is illegal and going to church is a crime now.
[01:10:55.148 --> 01:10:57.109]  Wow.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.322]  And then here's a twist.
[01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:05.413]  Roofing Company offers a free AR-15 with a new roof!
[01:11:06.408 --> 01:11:08.008]  This is sending liberals out of control.
[01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:16.510]  A roofing company in Wyoming is giving away a free AR-15 rifle with the purchase of a new roof, a spectacular offer that has left us freaking out.
[01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.350]  This story is at Infowars.com.
[01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:29.873]  Matt Thomas, Marketing Director for Wiggins Construction in Powell, Wyoming, said he came up with the idea after noticing people moving into the state in droves from California.
[01:11:29.893 --> 01:11:36.174]  I have a feeling that is going to be a good marketing campaign for that roofing company.
[01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:39.613]  I have a feeling.
[01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:40.193]  All right.
[01:11:42.333 --> 01:11:43.614]  Let's go to the phone lines.
[01:11:44.494 --> 01:11:47.115]  And we have Ken dialed in from Oklahoma.
[01:11:47.155 --> 01:11:51.556]  Ken wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter protests happening in Oklahoma.
[01:11:51.576 --> 01:11:52.197]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:11:53.617 --> 01:11:53.997]  Hey, Owen.
[01:11:54.017 --> 01:11:54.857]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:55.938 --> 01:12:03.100]  There was going to be a protest that was talked about on Harrison Show Friday, and the protest was for this weekend.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.661]  It was going to be Friday night and they canceled it.
[01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:17.566]  And there was, I guess we had rain come through, which is a good thing, but I guess they're trying to get motivated for this white silence is violence march that they're trying to do in some of the upper class neighborhoods here in Oklahoma City.
[01:12:17.586 --> 01:12:18.926]  White silence is violence?
[01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:20.987]  Yeah, white silence is violence.
[01:12:21.007 --> 01:12:27.070]  So first they have signs in George Floyd Square that say Whitey isn't allowed to talk, but also white silence is violence.
[01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.950]  Boy, Ken, I don't know.
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.811]  I feel like I'm screwed on this deal.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.041]  Yeah, right.
[01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:37.669]  If you're in George Floyd Square and you're not talking, you're violent and they're probably going to turn on you, so... But also, they tell you you're not allowed to talk if you're white.
[01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:38.911]  I feel like I'm getting set up.
[01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:40.253]  Exactly.
[01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:40.833]  That's what it is.
[01:12:41.354 --> 01:12:48.043]  And, you know, none of the news... See, I want to thank you guys at InfoWarsU and everybody else that brought this out on Wednesday that the BLM
[01:12:53.352 --> 01:13:01.098]  By the way, that story, I'm glad you even re-brought that up because, I mean, we're just like berserkers charging in trench warfare.
[01:13:01.438 --> 01:13:06.081]  Like, I don't have time to turn around and look at, you know, the spoils of war or lament or anything.
[01:13:06.842 --> 01:13:09.704]  That never got any mainstream coverage, Ken.
[01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:10.544]  Literally.
[01:13:10.885 --> 01:13:11.405]  Zero.
[01:13:11.425 --> 01:13:15.548]  It did get a little bit of mainstream coverage in articles online.
[01:13:16.178 --> 01:13:21.405]  Fox News put out something about it, a couple other people talked about it, but it was only national mainstream coverage.
[01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:27.553]  None of the local news agencies in Oklahoma covered it at all, and there's one talking head
[01:13:28.135 --> 01:13:40.319]  On Twitter, Dylan Richards, who works for KOCO, which is News Channel 5 in Oklahoma City, he put up a couple tweets about it and he just whitewashed it, as in they didn't really break in and there wasn't really a lockdown.
[01:13:40.399 --> 01:13:54.604]  Everything he said about it online was just worshiping BLM to make it look like whatever they did was good and justified, where old ladies are going into the Capitol, you know, the state, the federal Capitol, and whenever they're walking through the lines and they're carrying a flag, they're going to go to jail.
[01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.327]  Well yeah, they're Democrats.
[01:13:56.347 --> 01:14:00.850]  Don't you know Democrats don't have the same justice, don't have the same court of laws that other people have, right?
[01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:01.490]  So that's how that goes.
[01:14:12.737 --> 01:14:16.319]  I mean, as it is, these people are going to continue to do this and it's going to continue to get worse.
[01:14:16.439 --> 01:14:16.880]  Oh, sure.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:23.264]  And they'll get up on your dinner table and, you know, kick your food over and say you're not welcome here and cause the business owners a bunch of business.
[01:14:23.324 --> 01:14:24.565]  And, you know, they just think it's all great.
[01:14:24.605 --> 01:14:25.605]  These are not bright people.
[01:14:26.066 --> 01:14:27.627]  They're a threat to themselves and everyone around them.
[01:14:27.907 --> 01:14:29.128]  Ken, thank you so much for the call.
[01:14:29.468 --> 01:14:31.949]  Let's go to Kevin in New York City.
[01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:34.471]  Kevin, you are on the Alex Jones Show this Sunday.
[01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:34.891]  Go ahead.
[01:14:35.932 --> 01:14:36.853]  Oh, and how are you, brother?
[01:14:37.393 --> 01:14:37.613]  Good.
[01:14:38.794 --> 01:14:39.895]  I'm just checking in with you.
[01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.676]  So I'm doing a lot of
[01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:44.273]  Oh, it's the victim economy.
[01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:45.533]  Everyone's a victim.
[01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:15.795]  You know, and I have people texting me before we do a showing for an apartment and they're like, have you gotten vaccinated?
[01:15:15.895 --> 01:15:17.817]  And that comes to be the question.
[01:15:17.837 --> 01:15:19.858]  Like, yeah, they want to know my medical information.
[01:15:19.878 --> 01:15:21.220]  Yeah, like you can't even do it.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.144]  So you, if people harass you, you're just trying to show them a piece of property and they harass you for your medical history.
[01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:28.165]  Right.
[01:15:28.325 --> 01:15:28.625]  Definitely.
[01:15:28.645 --> 01:15:32.648]  And I'm trying to think of what ailments I should come up with to tell them, you know, and that's all I got.
[01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:33.569]  I just want to say hello.
[01:15:35.933 --> 01:15:38.154]  All right, Kevin, thank you so much for the call.
[01:15:38.174 --> 01:15:40.596]  All right, I'm going to keep taking calls on the other side.
[01:15:40.616 --> 01:15:43.037]  I got one segment left, and then it's Harrison Smith.
[01:15:43.077 --> 01:15:43.738]  He's loaded.
[01:15:44.178 --> 01:15:46.479]  He's got a bunch of news he's going to break down as well.

[01:16:22.522 --> 01:16:29.087]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:29.568 --> 01:16:32.770]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:16:35.152 --> 01:16:38.135]  We're closing out the Alex Jones Show today with your phone calls.
[01:16:38.175 --> 01:16:39.316]  Harrison Smith takes over.
[01:16:39.376 --> 01:16:43.219]  He hosts Sunday Night Live in T-minus 13 minutes.
[01:16:45.441 --> 01:16:49.404]  We go back to the phone lines now, though, and let's go to Tim in California.
[01:16:50.322 --> 01:16:53.986]  Who has something developing there in California I've not heard of.
[01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:54.687]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:16:56.129 --> 01:16:58.331]  Well, it's not located in California.
[01:16:58.351 --> 01:17:00.374]  It's actually overseas somewhere.
[01:17:00.394 --> 01:17:01.695]  It borders two countries.
[01:17:01.775 --> 01:17:09.784]  But back in September of 2008, it took them a long time to build it, but they launched the Large Hadron Collider.
[01:17:10.045 --> 01:17:10.946]  So you're talking about CERN?
[01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:12.645]  Exactly.
[01:17:12.665 --> 01:17:14.887]  666 CERN.
[01:17:14.907 --> 01:17:16.028]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:17:16.068 --> 01:17:18.530]  I was under the impression there was a new CERN being built.
[01:17:18.971 --> 01:17:19.971]  You're talking about that.
[01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:22.033]  No, I am talking about it.
[01:17:22.073 --> 01:17:23.294]  I was going to step to that too.
[01:17:23.735 --> 01:17:24.876]  You know, this is the comedy.
[01:17:25.256 --> 01:17:25.997]  Why would you guys
[01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:32.493]  Get so fascinated about this thing and then have all this information about, oh, these terrible demonic spirits and all these things.
[01:17:32.533 --> 01:17:33.654]  We've opened the pit of hell.
[01:17:33.974 --> 01:17:35.435]  And then it just got very quiet.
[01:17:35.475 --> 01:17:36.455]  But here it is years later.
[01:17:36.575 --> 01:17:40.418]  They're planning on building not a 20-mile diameter one like the first one.
[01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:43.699]  No, this one's going to be 62-mile diameter.
[01:17:43.719 --> 01:17:46.381]  They'll probably make it 66 just for fun, you know?
[01:17:47.051 --> 01:17:48.812]  Well, yeah, it's funny you say that.
[01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:49.432]  Isn't it funny?
[01:17:49.852 --> 01:17:51.733]  The inert ingredients in your inoculation?
[01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:53.914]  Well, they're 66.6%.
[01:17:53.954 --> 01:17:56.034]  It couldn't be any other amount had to be that amount.
[01:17:56.134 --> 01:18:04.938]  You know, I was really into studying CERN like five or so years ago, and there's so many weird anomalies, and people talk about weird anomalies in the sky around CERN.
[01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:05.618]  Their logo is 666.
[01:18:05.658 --> 01:18:05.878]  Yeah.
[01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:08.439]  I just, to me,
[01:18:12.385 --> 01:18:16.267]  The reason I bring this up is because Alex has just beaten his head in the ground.
[01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:17.108]  He's like, what is this?
[01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:18.549]  Is this space entities?
[01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:19.950]  Is this demonic?
[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.491]  Everyone's just brainwashing it.
[01:18:21.971 --> 01:18:26.774]  And I think everything was cooking along that way until they opened up the pit of hell.
[01:18:27.094 --> 01:18:29.816]  I think this is like letting the genie out of the bottle.
[01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:37.181]  I think this is about the time that everyone you knew all your life that you could have a reasonable conversation with suddenly had these Joker faces.
[01:18:37.601 --> 01:18:39.303]  You know, they all got this demonic look.
[01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:44.807]  I mean, honestly, it's so crazy, you almost have to go to sci-fi to try to explain it.
[01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.449]  It's like the Ghostbusters or something.
[01:18:46.749 --> 01:18:48.490]  And, like, they just released all the ghosts.
[01:18:50.432 --> 01:18:55.216]  I mean, I don't know that this is the answer to all our problems, Warner, but I tell you what, I think it needs a real good sniff test.
[01:18:55.616 --> 01:19:03.042]  Well, did you ever see the, uh, in Europe they built some tunnel, it's like the longest underground tunnel, and they had a, it was like a weird ritual.
[01:19:03.888 --> 01:19:04.788]  It's real demonic.
[01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:07.389]  They had like a demonic ritual to introduce this tunnel.
[01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.230]  I forget what it was called.
[01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:17.653]  Anyway, if folks want a very curious thing to look into, CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, there's a lot of weird stuff going on there.
[01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:25.676]  You know, they're just trying to bend the physics and time and smash things together and, you know, who knows what's going on.
[01:19:26.036 --> 01:19:27.016]  Tim, thank you so much for the call.
[01:19:27.057 --> 01:19:28.197]  Oh yeah, and their logo is 666.
[01:19:28.317 --> 01:19:29.758]  I'm sure that's not a big deal.
[01:19:29.818 --> 01:19:30.538]  Let's go to...
[01:19:31.991 --> 01:19:32.651]  Let's see here.
[01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:34.332]  We've got some good callers here.
[01:19:34.712 --> 01:19:35.992]  Weiland in New Hampshire.
[01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:38.053]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:38.413]  Go ahead.
[01:19:39.414 --> 01:19:40.294]  Yeah, Weiland.
[01:19:41.234 --> 01:19:41.414]  Yep.
[01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:44.435]  Yeah, this is Weiland, okay, in New Hampshire.
[01:19:44.895 --> 01:19:45.055]  Yep.
[01:19:45.436 --> 01:19:50.077]  I just wanted to say something, not say something.
[01:19:50.237 --> 01:19:53.298]  It's what I have come up with, you know, over the years.
[01:19:53.718 --> 01:19:59.140]  I've listened to Alex for about 23 years, and I've listened to a lot of things.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.421]  And of course, everybody tries to figure out something.
[01:20:02.123 --> 01:20:03.324]  Uh, to the solution.
[01:20:04.144 --> 01:20:09.167]  Right now, I will be honest with you, I feel very bad for your listeners.
[01:20:10.147 --> 01:20:15.510]  Because, either, probably by accident, but they've got a lot of information.
[01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:19.792]  And none of this information is going to solve a thing, one thing.
[01:20:20.553 --> 01:20:23.774]  Now, it's going to be our money supply, and I'm going to tell you why.
[01:20:24.515 --> 01:20:26.676]  We have a fiat money supply.
[01:20:27.276 --> 01:20:30.858]  We've been fed a lot of propaganda on that, so it's such as,
[01:20:31.408 --> 01:20:34.611]  A barrel full of money to buy a loaf of bread now.
[01:20:34.991 --> 01:20:36.633]  I mean, that's garbage.
[01:20:36.893 --> 01:20:39.215]  You were one of the ones thinking that way, okay?
[01:20:39.776 --> 01:20:45.881]  Now, the fiat money supply can be used for one of two reasons, depending on who controls it.
[01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:53.168]  It can be used for great wealth or great poverty, depending on who controls it and what their agenda is.
[01:20:53.544 --> 01:21:00.490]  Well, and that's why they don't want we, the people, controlling our currency and they don't want a cryptocurrency because it's controlled by people and it's not centralized.
[01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.734]  And, you know, I understand what you're talking about about the information here, but...
[01:21:06.581 --> 01:21:09.043]  For me it was, getting the information is what woke me up.
[01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:15.328]  So we just try to pay that forward, and we just believe if people hear the truth, they want to know the truth, they'll respond to the truth.
[01:21:15.769 --> 01:21:19.472]  And so that's why we do lay out the information, and we're filling the void.
[01:21:19.572 --> 01:21:20.493]  Nobody else does it.
[01:21:20.553 --> 01:21:23.695]  So somebody has to fill it, and that's where InfoWars comes into play.
[01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:33.263]  But yeah, eventually people are going to have to, it's going to have to be a mass awakening, and people are going to have to get involved in local politics, and I don't know where it goes from here to save America.
[01:21:35.717 --> 01:21:38.939]  Getting the information out there so people know what's going on is imperative to me.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.942]  Let's go to Paul in Georgia.
[01:21:42.302 --> 01:21:43.543]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:43.563 --> 01:21:44.223]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:21:45.284 --> 01:21:51.269]  Those who are awake have a duty to interpose themselves on this undeclared war against humanity.
[01:21:52.069 --> 01:22:00.896]  We have to stop these criminals and we have to stop them from actually trying to institute all of their plans against us.
[01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:03.978]  There's a number of ways to do this, but it's not going to be
[01:22:05.063 --> 01:22:07.326]  On the political level.
[01:22:07.346 --> 01:22:08.206]  It has to be beyond that.
[01:22:08.226 --> 01:22:09.027]  It has to be cultural.
[01:22:09.588 --> 01:22:12.951]  InfoWars has long since been working on the cultural level.
[01:22:13.452 --> 01:22:20.279]  We have to continue to talk to the people as best we can, try to wake them up as best we can, and try to get them to understand.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.362]  But they're going to end up killing a great number of us, it looks like.
[01:22:24.143 --> 01:22:24.544]  Your thoughts?
[01:22:26.035 --> 01:22:27.958]  Well yeah, I mean look at the vaccine alone.
[01:22:28.178 --> 01:22:32.104]  People are dropping dead, famous people, public health officials in India.
[01:22:32.124 --> 01:22:35.810]  So I mean yeah, the abortions by the millions.
[01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:40.457]  Yeah, some people don't even make it into this world and some people get in and...
[01:22:41.325 --> 01:22:49.610]  You know, they get hit with the propaganda, they get hit with the poison in the water and the food, they get hit with the vaccine.
[01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:52.091]  So, yeah, no, it's a population control agenda.
[01:22:52.152 --> 01:23:00.857]  Eugenicists are at the top of it, and as soon as people realize that, they'll probably panic, quite frankly, but that's the appropriate response.
[01:23:00.897 --> 01:23:01.697]  Paul, thank you for the call.
[01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:06.580]  PL in Kansas, PL in Kansas, here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:06.980]  Go ahead.
[01:23:08.161 --> 01:23:08.922]  Thank you, Owen, for...
[01:23:11.175 --> 01:23:25.223]  So, first, I'd like to start off by saying that I'm glad outlets like you guys and the National File and the Ethics Times provide a way for information about the truth regarding the vaccines, like how
[01:23:26.203 --> 01:23:29.145]  Yeah, you still talk to the average person on the street or at the store or something.
[01:23:29.165 --> 01:23:30.687]  They don't know any of this.
[01:23:50.049 --> 01:24:06.093]  Like, for instance, the news here mostly talks about how the progress with the vaccine rollout is coming along and how the case rates look, but distressingly, there's very little information about how... Well, let me explain it like this.
[01:24:07.733 --> 01:24:12.915]  The same censorship that we see on the internet from big tech companies has already
[01:24:13.937 --> 01:24:15.398]  Run its course on television.
[01:24:16.138 --> 01:24:19.239]  We just didn't know it because it wasn't as easy to access.
[01:24:19.299 --> 01:24:20.540]  We couldn't get access to it.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:26.562]  So television news has already gone through the rings of censorship.
[01:24:27.682 --> 01:24:33.787]  Where what we're seeing with censorship on social media is what's already been going on in television for decades.
[01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:36.489]  They've already censored people like Alex Jones off TV.
[01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:38.630]  They've already censored people like Michael Savage off TV.
[01:24:38.891 --> 01:24:41.573]  They've already put a blacklist out with my name on it for TV.
[01:24:41.653 --> 01:24:44.875]  So we just don't know that because we can't get access to it.
[01:24:45.235 --> 01:24:48.618]  But that's why, oh yeah, the television news telling you the vaccine is great.
[01:24:48.638 --> 01:24:51.000]  You know, everybody says, get the vaccine, it's all good.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:55.783]  Whereas if you go to the independent media, they're at least showing you both sides of the aisle.
[01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:59.445]  So it's just the TV has already been totally censored.
[01:24:59.925 --> 01:25:01.966]  It's for the most part all propaganda now.
[01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:05.469]  That's why 95% of TV news was anti-Trump.
[01:25:06.069 --> 01:25:07.650]  Let's squeeze one more caller in here.
[01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:08.791]  Aaron in Las Vegas.
[01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:09.551]  Make it quick.
[01:25:10.792 --> 01:25:12.153]  Owen, pleasure to meet you, sir.
[01:25:12.253 --> 01:25:14.194]  You're as cool as Mr. Jones.
[01:25:14.454 --> 01:25:18.356]  I just want to hear your opinion on Title 18, USC Section 242.
[01:25:20.035 --> 01:25:23.177]  And how that could pertain to putting masks on children in the schools.
[01:25:24.337 --> 01:25:27.639]  And the last sentence of that provision being, or death.
[01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:29.840]  What can we do to help the kids?
[01:25:31.521 --> 01:25:34.562]  Well, parents are going to have to go to school board meetings.
[01:25:34.582 --> 01:25:35.983]  They're going to have to run for school board.
[01:25:36.003 --> 01:25:37.263]  They're going to have to go to city councils.
[01:25:37.283 --> 01:25:40.325]  They're going to have to raise their voices or they're going to have to pull their kids out of schools.
[01:25:42.517 --> 01:25:46.722]  The problem is you can't stop paying the taxes for the schools, so that's kind of where they have you there.
[01:25:47.584 --> 01:25:50.507]  But yeah, the torture of the children with the face masks is out of control.
[01:25:50.527 --> 01:25:51.969]  It's going to have to be parents that rise up.
[01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:53.151]  We have to be the voice.
[01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:54.553]  The parents have to be the voice of the young.
[01:25:54.573 --> 01:25:55.714]  Aaron, thanks for the call.
[01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:56.916]  On this day!
[01:25:58.246 --> 01:26:07.871]  Rick Monday of the Chicago Cubs on this day, April 25th, Rick Monday of the Chicago Cubs did a heroic act which today would have probably landed him in jail.
[01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:13.014]  But we flash back in time to a better time when American athletes were Patriots.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.925]  It looks like he's going to burn a flag and Rick Monday runs and takes it away from him.
[01:26:27.085 --> 01:26:32.169]  And so Monday, I think a guy was going to set fire to the American flag.
[01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:33.350]  Can you imagine that?
[01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:37.594]  Well, they better lose him in a hurry.
[01:26:37.954 --> 01:26:42.098]  And Monday, when he realized what he was going to do, Ray Stover
[01:26:43.066 --> 01:26:43.586]  Look at that.
[01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:45.447]  And the broadcasters loved it.
[01:26:45.487 --> 01:26:46.387]  The crowd loved it.
[01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:47.807]  Even the Jumbotron loved it.
[01:26:47.867 --> 01:26:50.568]  A better day where an American patriot was a hero.
[01:26:50.608 --> 01:26:51.748]  Harrison Smith takes over.
[01:26:51.788 --> 01:26:52.949]  You stay classy, Infowarriors.
[01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:59.770]  I've had major supplement manufacturers come to us and say, Mr. Jones.
[01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:01.811]  One of them is actually French.
[01:27:02.944 --> 01:27:13.518]  If you would just give people lower quality supplements, you wouldn't have supply problems and you could charge the same amount but make a bigger profit.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:15.721]  And I'm like, but wait a minute.
[01:27:16.301 --> 01:27:25.166]  I want the highest quality because I want my listeners to get the highest quality because it's some metaphysical level.
[01:27:25.326 --> 01:27:40.994]  I just pick up the mojo that if I say I've got the best vitamin B12, which is ultra 12 or super high quality vitamin D3, which is winter sun, or the most amazing natural 10 hour energy turbo force,
[01:27:42.352 --> 01:27:45.334]  That it better damn well be good and it better damn well work.
[01:27:46.214 --> 01:27:50.617]  I mean, that's not like some gimmick that I just say.
[01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:57.701]  Just like with the information we cover, I don't let their threats or their attacks control what I say because it's electricity.
[01:27:58.642 --> 01:28:05.266]  When I give you my all, you support me and we have victory.
[01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.375]  So it isn't some altruistic thing.
[01:28:08.595 --> 01:28:11.356]  Oh, Jones is so liberal or loving.
[01:28:11.396 --> 01:28:13.076]  He's so moral.
[01:28:13.697 --> 01:28:14.797]  No, I'm a crazed berserker.
[01:28:15.397 --> 01:28:18.898]  But I learned very early in life, treat others as you want to be treated.
[01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:19.719]  That's the golden rule.
[01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:22.320]  Well, beyond the golden rule is lay down your life for others.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.760]  That's being Christ-like.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.041]  I've never quite gotten to that point.
[01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:28.742]  But I do treat others as I want to be treated.
[01:28:28.882 --> 01:28:31.783]  And thank you so much for supporting us over the years.
[01:28:32.803 --> 01:28:33.964]  Man, we need funding.
[01:28:34.385 --> 01:28:40.590]  We've got so many projects we could launch if you just support us and we've got products that are incredible.
[01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:42.312]  I could sell you
[01:28:44.036 --> 01:29:02.933]  Mail enhancement stuff for one-third of the price it's costing me, and it would still give you somewhat of a good effect, but I go get the organic, highest grade we can, and then I stay on those manufacturers, and I stay on them with the testing, and then sometimes they screw us over and don't give us the best batch.
[01:29:03.114 --> 01:29:08.619]  I mean, I'm gonna be completely honest, even though I'm shooting for the stars, sometimes we only make the mountains.
[01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:12.157]  But we're not down the valleys on purpose trying to screw you over.
[01:29:12.577 --> 01:29:14.959]  Like some badges of knockout will be super frickin' strong.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.961]  Other ones are like, this isn't as strong as that.
[01:29:17.361 --> 01:29:19.863]  That's the way organic, wild source stuff works.
[01:29:21.365 --> 01:29:22.806]  It's not some chemical we're giving you.
[01:29:22.826 --> 01:29:25.228]  That's why everybody does chemicals, because they can tell.
[01:29:25.248 --> 01:29:28.491]  It's cheap, it's ready, it's a chemical, it manipulates something in your brain.
[01:29:28.851 --> 01:29:31.293]  It's not natural, so it has a lot of side effects.
[01:29:31.353 --> 01:29:31.913]  We don't do that.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:38.413]  So, when I tell you Alva Power is amazing, it's the same herbs that are in Supermill Vitality, that's just cold-pressed.
[01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:40.333]  This is dry herbs.
[01:29:40.473 --> 01:29:41.053]  It works great.
[01:29:41.073 --> 01:29:41.633]  It's very strong.
[01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:42.154]  It's amazing.
[01:29:42.574 --> 01:29:44.134]  Male libido, stamina, energy.
[01:29:44.214 --> 01:29:44.954]  Women love it as well.
[01:29:44.994 --> 01:29:45.634]  It's back in stock.
[01:29:46.454 --> 01:29:46.614]  40% off.
[01:29:46.674 --> 01:29:47.814]  Prostagard, everybody knows about.
[01:29:47.835 --> 01:29:48.455]  Salt Palmetto.
[01:29:48.735 --> 01:29:49.515]  But it's not just for men.
[01:29:49.535 --> 01:29:50.435]  It's great for women as well.
[01:29:50.955 --> 01:29:54.316]  And it's got all these different multivitamins and things in it that are excellent as well.
[01:29:54.696 --> 01:29:58.536]  Winter Sun, super high-end vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system.
[01:29:58.576 --> 01:29:59.336]  It's back in stock.
[01:29:59.877 --> 01:30:02.337]  Pure Turmeric Liquid Extract is about to sell out.
[01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:04.691]  We won't get more for 12 weeks.
[01:30:04.711 --> 01:30:05.592]  We just put the new order in.
[01:30:06.592 --> 01:30:08.614]  But I gotta sell it at sale so you'll buy it.
[01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:10.575]  So it's on sale, 40% off.
[01:30:10.736 --> 01:30:14.238]  It'll be sold out for months after it sells out in just a few weeks.
[01:30:15.279 --> 01:30:16.100]  And so much more.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.282]  All t-shirts are $17.76 in game.
[01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:21.984]  It's as low as $3.95 apiece to expose what's going on.

[01:30:35.134 --> 01:30:38.997]  When you shop with the globalists, you are helping destroy yourself.
[01:30:39.538 --> 01:30:41.479]  So, we got a lot of sales going on right now.
