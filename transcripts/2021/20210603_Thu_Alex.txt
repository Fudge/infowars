[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:14.290]  The timing, the preparation, the white papers, the Rockefeller documents, Event 201, Crimson Contagion, all of it pre-planned, all of the response rolled out for the UN to be in charge, everyone else to be censored, real treatments.
[00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:40.104]  Like hydroxychloroquine, Rendesivir and others, blocked so you can bring out the experimental gene therapy and set the precedent of a medical tyranny upon the world, which is causing massive heart attacks, massive strokes, massive disintegration of lungs, which again, Fauci did specific studies at the University of Texas and others, knowing that vaccines of the same type, but under another name, did this.
[00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:44.406]  So this is a very sophisticated criminal rollout plan.
[00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:50.948]  They did it at Wuhan, a multinational lab, so you couldn't blame the U.S., you couldn't blame China, and the U.N.
[00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:51.669]  could be the savior.
[00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.930]  This is all a globalist, great reset operation.
[00:00:55.271 --> 00:01:00.493]  Schwab even admits this is helping bring in their world government, helping cut the carbon, all of this.
[00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:03.035]  This is their big move.
[00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:08.758]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.921]  Humanity's hunger for freedom.
[00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:16.966]  Humanity's thirst for justice.
[00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:25.931]  Humanity's drive for information understanding is unquenchable.
[00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:39.539]  But in the full spectrum of information and knowledge on this planet, this transmission is a fount, is a headwater of what we as a species seek.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.520]  And that is light.
[00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.161]  That is freedom.
[00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:43.742]  That is God.
[00:01:46.274 --> 00:02:05.218]  Tucker Carlson did a splendid job last night in a 11 and a half minute monologue of laying out the compendium of where we are, and I'm going to be airing large portions of that and commenting on it coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:13.660]  And I like how they describe him as Lord Fauci, Lord Biden.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:26.367]  I am quite proud of the fact that my little colloquialism that I tend to add on the fronts of these guys is now being picked up in popular nomenclature, and I guess you could say parlance.
[00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:33.431]  But Lord Fauci and Lord Gates and Lord
[00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:41.806]  Head of the Davos Group, Klaus Schwab, are going down, or we're going down.
[00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:54.132]  And boy, have his emails come out, with him dismissing colleagues, sending him the actual documents, where they give the gain of function sequencing.
[00:02:56.774 --> 00:03:01.136]  And you notice, the original Zero Hedge article was sent to Fauci.
[00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:04.157]  So I mean, I'm giving credit where credit was due.
[00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:05.838]  In Western media, that was the first place.
[00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:09.922]  It was the Indian Institute that first scanned it, and then others did, and we confirmed it.
[00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:18.849]  We already knew the backstory on Fauci, and the AIDS program, and Chapel Hill, and moving the virus program there.
[00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.374]  So that's why this has been so frustrating the last 16 months, is it was always hiding in plain view.
[00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:28.938]  But the bigger issue now, because you're not tuning in to get last year's news today,
[00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.116]  You're tuning in to get next year's news today, and so we'll give you next month and next year's news.
[00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:43.384]  But at this juncture, things start getting a little blurry because now there's a real battle inside the power structure.
[00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:51.733]  And so the New World Order elite types are going to try to trigger a financial collapse
[00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.613]  They're going to try to do that, claiming hackers have done it.
[00:03:55.633 --> 00:04:01.838]  They've been beta testing, shutting down pipelines and shutting down meatpacking facilities and shutting down ferries.
[00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:10.125]  And then telling you that they're going to be the saviors when it all comes, even though they're the ones that want to disrupt society, consolidate society.
[00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:16.811]  You notice the hackers never hit the UN, they never hit Amazon, they never hit, um,
[00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.232]  Bill Gates and people.
[00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:25.514]  They never hit Elon Musk.
[00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:31.097]  They always hit infrastructure that hurts the little guy and consolidates power control for them.
[00:04:31.177 --> 00:04:32.298]  They are the ones doing it.
[00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.399]  They're the ones shutting pipelines off publicly.
[00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:35.840]  They are the New World Order.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.401]  They are the disruptors.
[00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:50.849]  They are the ones that want a post-industrial world and created a treaty in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro that our evil globalist president, Mr. New World Order, Herbert Walker Bush, may he burn in hell, promoted.
[00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:58.983]  So we know the compendium and the trajectory and the river in which we flow, but now we approach the sea.
[00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:03.148]  The world government, the dehumanization, the depopulation.
[00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.534]  Now the journey is beginning to reach its nightmare destination.
[00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:19.109]  And we're going to talk about how we stop it and what they're planning and the different possible futures that are rapidly approaching us as if we're driving down a highway at 300 miles an hour.
[00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:20.910]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.492]  Everybody, you know, tune in because history's happening now.
[00:05:26.454 --> 00:05:27.855]  It's Thursday, June 3rd, 2021.
[00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:30.717]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:33.119]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.021]  Well, the fall of the globalist
[00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:53.572]  Medical tyrant that is now in accelerated free fall, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is truly the first domino to fall that could bring down much of the Anglo-American China's globalist system.
[00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:58.573]  And we're going to be laying all of that out today, next year's news, today.
[00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:04.880]  No need to celebrate that we were amongst the first to tell you exactly what's really going on.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.742]  No need to go back in time.
[00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:08.904]  We're not giving you last year's news today.
[00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:11.687]  We're going to give you next year's news today.
[00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:17.813]  But Tucker Carlson did a really good summation of how far we've come educating the public.
[00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:19.234]  So I'm going to air part of that.
[00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:21.757]  Then we're going to come back in the next segment and I'm going to get to
[00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:28.801]  Currently, what's happening and how the globalists are going to strike back and what I believe you can expect to see unfold very, very quickly.
[00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:32.623]  And knowing this may actually be able to stop them.
[00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:36.544]  But if we don't have a massive awakening now, we're in deep trouble.
[00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:39.426]  You see, we don't have a year and a half to prove things again.
[00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.086]  We don't have six months to do it.
[00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:42.707]  We need to get people up to speed.
[00:06:42.727 --> 00:06:43.668]  You need to listen now.
[00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:50.171]  And I don't mean the listeners that are already dialed in, but the government and others that tune in and other media individuals.
[00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:52.301]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:54.962]  We live in the real world, the real politique.
[00:06:55.303 --> 00:06:55.883]  That's what I do.
[00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:57.303]  I study how these people actually operate.
[00:06:57.643 --> 00:07:08.467]  And so we can either start being participants in the world and actually know how it works and realize we got some really bad people running things that are building a post-human world, or we can be totally enslaved.
[00:07:08.748 --> 00:07:17.751]  I know a lot of leftists and a lot of corporate types sign on to this dehumanization program and know about a lot of it, but pretend, pretend is a key operative word,
[00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:24.677]  That you're part of the system so you can just go along with it and you'll do better in the end.
[00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:25.117]  No, no, no.
[00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:30.561]  So far selling out your species has gotten you ahead, but now at the end you learned you were set up.
[00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:39.492]  So I'll talk about that today as well, but let's go to Tucker Carlson last night with the fall of the Gates U.N.
[00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:41.093]  frontman, Anthony Fauci.
[00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.855]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:07:44.536 --> 00:07:51.261]  The utter fraudulence of Tony Fauci is obvious now and it's widely acknowledged, but it was not always obvious.
[00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:55.044]  In March of last year, we interviewed Fauci on this show.
[00:07:55.104 --> 00:07:56.506]  We treated him with respect.
[00:07:56.646 --> 00:07:58.127]  We took his answer seriously.
[00:07:58.688 --> 00:08:02.151]  We're Americans, so we assumed the man in charge of protecting the U.S.
[00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.794]  from COVID must be rational and impressive.
[00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:07.036]  We also assumed he must be honest.
[00:08:07.516 --> 00:08:08.297]  But we were wrong.
[00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:15.784]  It soon became clear that Tony Fauci was just another sleazy federal bureaucrat, deeply political and often dishonest.
[00:08:16.502 --> 00:08:22.964]  More shocking than that, we then learned that Fauci himself was implicated in the very pandemic he'd been charged with fighting.
[00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:28.967]  Fauci supported the grotesque and dangerous experiments that appeared to have made COVID possible.
[00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:35.249]  We came to these conclusions incrementally, spurred by evidence that accumulated over the course of a year.
[00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.170]  Tonight, we have the mother load.
[00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.552]  Thanks to a Freedom of Information request from BuzzFeed, we have thousands of emails to and from Anthony Fauci.
[00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:46.253]  They go back to the early winter of 2020.
[00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:56.797]  Collectively, they show that from the beginning, Tony Fauci was worried that the public might conclude COVID had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:08:57.677 --> 00:09:01.959]  Now, why would Tony Fauci be concerned that Americans would conclude that?
[00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:10.306]  Possibly because Tony Fauci knew perfectly well that he had funded gain-of-function experiments at that very same laboratory.
[00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:13.949]  The emails prove that Fauci lied about this under oath.
[00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.932]  Consider this exchange, which began the evening of January 31st, 2020.
[00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:20.414]  It was a Friday just before midnight.
[00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:27.581]  The first email came from an immunologist called Christian Anderson, who works at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.
[00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:33.646]  Anderson warned Fauci that COVID appeared to have been possibly manipulated in a laboratory.
[00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:34.647]  Quote,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.522]  The next day, on February 1st, Tony Fauci wrote back, Thanks, Christian.
[00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:52.823]  Talk soon on the call.
[00:09:53.423 --> 00:09:57.705]  Fauci then sent an urgent email to his deputy, a man called Hugh Auchincloss.
[00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:00.927]  The subject of that email, in all caps, was IMPORTANT.
[00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:04.429]  Quote, Hugh, It is essential that we speak this a.m.
[00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:05.750]  Keep your cell phone on.
[00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.852]  Read this paper as well as the email that I will forward.
[00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:11.773]  You will have tasks today that must be done.
[00:10:12.954 --> 00:10:15.116]  Attached to that email was a document.
[00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:18.098]  It was entitled, quote, Barrack Shee et al.
[00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:22.382]  Nature Medicine SARS Gain of Function dot PDF.
[00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:28.286]  Now, the Barrack in the attachment referred to Ralph Barrack, a virologist based in the U.S.
[00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.808]  who collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:37.754]  Barrack worked with a woman called Dr. Shi Shengli, known as the Bat Lady, because she manipulates coronaviruses that infect bats.
[00:10:38.134 --> 00:10:39.675]  She was the Shee in the attachment.
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:50.481]  Now, keep in mind that during the questioning from Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky fairly recently, Tony Fauci denied that this same Ralph Baric had conducted gain-of-function research.
[00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:56.104]  Again, this is the Ralph Baric in Fauci's attachment, which was entitled Baric, she et al.
[00:10:56.404 --> 00:10:58.925]  SARS gain-of-function.pdf.
[00:11:00.186 --> 00:11:04.208]  And yet, under oath before the United States Congress, Fauci denied this.
[00:11:05.646 --> 00:11:15.074]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain-of-function research, and if it is, it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North Carolina.
[00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:24.583]  And if you look at the grant, and you look at the progress reports, it is not gain-of-function, despite the fact that people tweet that.
[00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:27.607]  Oh, it wasn't just on Twitter.
[00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:29.348]  It was in Fauci's own emails.
[00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:32.529]  In retrospect, that looks a lot like perjury.
[00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:39.372]  We do know that starting early last year, a lot of people at NIH were worried that COVID had not occurred naturally.
[00:11:39.392 --> 00:11:42.994]  They were concerned it had been instead manipulated in a lab in China.
[00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:47.056]  And yet they seem determined to hide those facts from the public.
[00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:47.757]  Again, why?
[00:11:48.837 --> 00:11:53.683]  On the afternoon of February 1st last year, Fauci held a conference call with several top virologists.
[00:11:54.144 --> 00:11:56.927]  Most of the details of that call were made hidden from public view.
[00:11:56.947 --> 00:11:57.968]  They've been redacted.
[00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:03.194]  We know the call was related to a document entitled Coronavirus Sequence Comparison.
[00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:13.223]  Jeremy Farrar, a British physician who runs a major research non-profit, reminded everyone on the call that what they said was top secret.
[00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:23.531]  Quote, In other emails, Jeremy Farrar passed along an article from the website Zero Hedge.
[00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.974]  That piece suggested the coronavirus might have been created as a bioweapon.
[00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:36.944]  We now know that is a more plausible explanation than the one we believed at first and were told by the media, which is that Corona came from a pangolin.
[00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:45.212]  And yet for the crime of saying that out loud, a more plausible explanation, Zero Hedge was banned from social media platforms.
[00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.236]  Until recently, you were not allowed to suggest that COVID might be man-made.
[00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.378]  Why couldn't you suggest that?
[00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:53.660]  The fact-checkers wouldn't allow it.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.620]  Why wouldn't they?
[00:12:55.121 --> 00:13:00.745]  Because Tony Fauci assured the tech monopolies that the coronavirus could not have been man-made.
[00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:03.546]  And so the tech monopolies shut down the topic.
[00:13:04.447 --> 00:13:05.428]  Watch Fauci lie.
[00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:29.602]  A group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences there and the sequences in bats as they evolve and the mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.
[00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:35.882]  That was April 17th, 2020, very shortly into the course of this pandemic.
[00:13:36.122 --> 00:13:41.766]  At that point, what Tony Fauci just asserted as known could not conclusively have been known.
[00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:43.507]  That was a lie.
[00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:52.153]  Tony Fauci suggested that he knew because top researchers had decided conclusively that this must have jumped naturally from an animal to a human being.
[00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:54.795]  But again, at that point, he could not have known that.
[00:13:55.015 --> 00:13:55.796]  That was dishonest.
[00:13:56.716 --> 00:14:05.098]  Two days after he said that, one of the virologists that Tony Fauci had funded to conduct dangerous coronavirus experiments in Wuhan wrote to thank him for the help.
[00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:15.061]  That man, a man called Peter Daszak, complained to Fauci that the American tax dollars he'd taken for these experiments were being, quote, publicly targeted by Fox News reporters.
[00:14:15.681 --> 00:14:18.342]  Yet Daszak remained grateful for Tony Fauci's support.
[00:14:18.702 --> 00:14:23.824]  Quote, I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators.
[00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:24.544]  End quote.
[00:14:25.524 --> 00:14:34.609]  Now, strangely, most of this specific email from Daszak to Fauci has been redacted, and it was redacted under FOIA Section B7a.
[00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:50.018]  That specific exemption to the FOIA law applies to, quote, records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of those documents could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.
[00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:53.586]  Are Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci under criminal investigation?
[00:14:53.886 --> 00:14:54.927]  We can only hope they are.
[00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:56.067]  They certainly deserve it.
[00:14:56.648 --> 00:14:58.069]  At this point, we can't say for sure.
[00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:04.033]  We do know that Fauci hasn't simply lied about the origins of COVID, pretending to know things he could not know.
[00:15:04.073 --> 00:15:04.853]  He's lied about the vaccines.
[00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:05.594]  He's also lied about vaccines.
[00:15:05.614 --> 00:15:10.357]  And we'll come back with that, the conclusion of Tucker, then I'll give you what's coming next, the key.
[00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:11.138]  Stay with us.
[00:15:13.268 --> 00:15:18.573]  All right, again, I rarely air an entire Tucker Carlson monologue, but this one is just well done.
[00:15:19.193 --> 00:15:21.856]  It's all truthful, but it only goes so far.
[00:15:21.876 --> 00:15:29.883]  We're going to give you the rest of the story as soon as we are done finishing this report here in just a moment.
[00:15:29.943 --> 00:15:33.366]  So here is Tucker Carlson last night with the fall of Fauci.
[00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:43.126]  He's gone to the lab, how Fauci developed the gain of function, how he lied to Congress, how there's videos, how there's documents, how there's witnesses, how there's emails.
[00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:55.475]  And then they move on to the next thing, which is he's also the guy in control of the vaccine and the response and the rollout and the investigation into himself.
[00:15:56.175 --> 00:16:13.001]  Because if you're gonna launch something like this, which they did on purpose, the timing, the preparation, the white papers, the Rockefeller documents, Event 201, Crimson Contagion, all of it pre-planned, all of the response rolled out for the UN to be in charge, everyone else to be censored,
[00:16:13.622 --> 00:16:14.368]  Real treatments.
[00:16:15.481 --> 00:16:40.227]  Like hydroxychloroquine, Rendesivir and others, blocked so you can bring out the experimental gene therapy and set the precedent of a medical tyranny upon the world, which is causing massive heart attacks, massive strokes, massive disintegration of lungs, which again, Fauci did specific studies at the University of Texas and others, knowing that vaccines of the same type, but under another name, did this.
[00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:44.488]  This is a very sophisticated criminal rollout plan.
[00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:51.035]  They did it at Wuhan, a multinational lab, so you couldn't blame the U.S., you couldn't blame China, and the U.N.
[00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:51.776]  could be the savior.
[00:16:51.997 --> 00:16:55.021]  This is all a globalist, great reset operation.
[00:16:55.382 --> 00:17:00.569]  Schwab even admits this is helping bring in their world government, helping cut the carbon, all of this.
[00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.096]  This is their big move.
[00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:05.918]  How wonderful and quiet the cities are.
[00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:08.581]  How it's depopulating the third world.
[00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:11.343]  How it caused birth rates to plummet across the West.
[00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.305]  This is their big salvo.
[00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:17.888]  Then there's the hack attacks that are just tests to also break down civilization and society.
[00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:23.853]  And while that happens, the big mega banks, the big tech companies, the big box stores, they are essential.
[00:17:24.114 --> 00:17:27.917]  They're designed to take the collapse and only they are left standing.
[00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:39.131]  There was a Roman emperor, of course, a particularly famous one that ended up dying in the gladiatorial arena himself, whose chief of staff held off the grain supplies.
[00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:40.952]  What was his name?
[00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:56.662]  Held off the grain supplies for six months so he could be a hero and bring in the grain supplies, but it actually got out of control and made people so sick that they starved, and so they got the Black Plague, and that ended up bringing down that emperor and the guy that tried the false flag.
[00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:01.845]  And it's happening yet again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:02.205 --> 00:18:03.125]  History repeats.
[00:18:03.326 --> 00:18:03.746]  Here it is.
[00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:06.062]  investigation.
[00:18:06.362 --> 00:18:07.423]  We can only hope they are.
[00:18:07.683 --> 00:18:08.563]  They certainly deserve it.
[00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:10.544]  At this point, we can't say for sure.
[00:18:11.204 --> 00:18:16.586]  We do know that Fauci hasn't simply lied about the origins of COVID, pretending to know things he could not know.
[00:18:17.046 --> 00:18:20.287]  He has also lied about vaccines in key ways.
[00:18:21.307 --> 00:18:27.632]  In March of last year, former Obama official Zeke Emanuel wrote to Fauci to ask a very simple question, one that we've asked countless times.
[00:18:28.332 --> 00:18:34.157]  Are people who have recovered from COVID generally immune from getting infected with COVID once again?
[00:18:34.797 --> 00:18:37.980]  That applies to about 100 million Americans, so it's not a small question.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:45.285]  Fauci's response, quote, no evidence in this regard, but you would assume that there would be substantial immunity post-infection.
[00:18:46.306 --> 00:18:47.526]  Well, yes, you would assume that.
[00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:48.407]  We always have.
[00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.828]  And in fact, studies now show it is true.
[00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:55.429]  People who have had COVID and recovered almost never get sick again from COVID.
[00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.430]  So they don't need to be vaccinated.
[00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.932]  Yet to this day, Tony Fauci has never admitted that in public.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.843]  In his email to Zeke Emanuel, he admitted something else that's also now obvious.
[00:19:07.443 --> 00:19:10.966]  Surgical masks, the paper kind all of us wear, don't really work.
[00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.149]  They offer very little protection from COVID.
[00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:18.332]  In fact, at least one study shows they may accelerate transmission of viruses.
[00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:20.374]  They are, in short, a form of make-believe.
[00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:25.778]  Yet once again, while under oath in public, Tony Fauci claimed precisely the opposite.
[00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:31.554]  You're telling everybody to wear a mask, whether they've had an infection or a vaccine.
[00:19:31.614 --> 00:19:34.916]  What I'm saying is they have immunity and everybody agrees they have immunity.
[00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:40.979]  What studies do you have that people who have had the vaccine or have had the infection are spreading the infection?
[00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:43.721]  If we're not spreading the infection, isn't it just theater?
[00:19:44.505 --> 00:19:44.925]  No, it's not.
[00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:46.746]  You got the vaccine and you're wearing two masks.
[00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:47.727]  Isn't that theater?
[00:19:48.007 --> 00:19:48.487]  No, it's not.
[00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:49.868]  Here we go again with the theater.
[00:19:49.928 --> 00:19:53.650]  Let me just state for the record that masks are not theater.
[00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.570]  Masks are protective.
[00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:57.752]  And we have immunity there, theater.
[00:19:58.012 --> 00:20:01.113]  If you already have immunity, you're wearing a mask to give comfort to others.
[00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:03.374]  You're not wearing a mask because of any science.
[00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:05.275]  I totally disagree with you.
[00:20:07.036 --> 00:20:08.157]  Rand Paul is a physician?
[00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:09.559]  He's smart.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.460]  What he just said was true.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.561]  And the science shows that it's true.
[00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:16.123]  There's not much debate about it, actually, among honest people.
[00:20:16.663 --> 00:20:18.544]  But Tony Fauci claimed it wasn't true.
[00:20:18.624 --> 00:20:19.204]  He lied.
[00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:20.745]  Why would he do that?
[00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:21.746]  Well, here's one reason.
[00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:25.508]  The emails show that Tony Fauci speaks regularly to Bill Gates.
[00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:26.948]  That's odd.
[00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:28.429]  Bill Gates is not a doctor.
[00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:29.829]  Bill Gates is not a scientist.
[00:20:29.889 --> 00:20:35.131]  Bill Gates is a very rich man who made billions making mediocre software for office computers.
[00:20:35.872 --> 00:20:39.933]  So why would Tony Fauci be in such regular contact with Bill Gates?
[00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:44.995]  The term Bill Gates comes up more than two dozen times when you search the Fauci emails.
[00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:50.009]  Has Bill Gates profited in any way from Tony Fauci's COVID guidance?
[00:20:50.969 --> 00:20:52.849]  That would definitely be worth knowing.
[00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:54.210]  Immediately.
[00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.830]  And yet we don't know.
[00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.130]  Our media don't seem interested in finding out.
[00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.771]  In fact, here's how CNN covered the emails today.
[00:21:13.593 --> 00:21:18.987]  Can you imagine a more dishonest characterization of anything than that?
[00:21:19.007 --> 00:21:20.510]  It's hard to.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.021]  By the way, it wasn't just CNN.
[00:21:23.502 --> 00:21:26.985]  No reporters asked about these emails at today's White House press briefing.
[00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:28.166]  Not one question.
[00:21:29.007 --> 00:21:30.228]  But you shouldn't be surprised.
[00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:31.289]  Of course they didn't ask.
[00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.593]  Tony Fauci is too big to question at this point.
[00:21:35.053 --> 00:21:39.718]  Quote, Oh my God, one Biden voter wrote to Tony Fauci back in March.
[00:21:40.158 --> 00:21:43.321]  Is there anything I can do for you besides being grateful?
[00:21:44.324 --> 00:21:47.486]  Wash my feet with your tears, Fauci may have responded.
[00:21:47.666 --> 00:21:49.867]  We can't say that he did respond that way for certain.
[00:21:50.087 --> 00:21:51.228]  We don't have his reply.
[00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:59.672]  We do know that in affluent neighborhoods throughout Northwest Washington... Alright, ladies and gentlemen, yes, this was released by design, and that's the rest of the story.
[00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:00.593]  Not leaked!
[00:22:01.673 --> 00:22:04.515]  We keep calling it a vaccine.
[00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:05.155]  It's not.
[00:22:05.395 --> 00:22:06.936]  It's a bioweapon.
[00:22:07.716 --> 00:22:08.577]  A gene therapy.
[00:22:09.237 --> 00:22:10.378]  We keep calling it a leak.
[00:22:10.438 --> 00:22:12.099]  It was a purposeful release.
[00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:15.045]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:17.507]  It wasn't a leak.
[00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:19.808]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:21.850]  It wasn't a leak.
[00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.591]  Even InfoWars has headlines.
[00:22:24.732 --> 00:22:27.594]  InfoWars told you about the Wuhan leak in January 2020.
[00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:33.619]  No, I said that it was a purposeful release.
[00:22:33.659 --> 00:22:34.599]  You could see it all.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.481]  It was in the blueprints.
[00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:37.902]  It was in the war games.
[00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:41.765]  And we come back.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.620]  Start your engines.
[00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:48.882]  Because I'm going to lay out where we really are and what is going to happen next.
[00:22:50.122 --> 00:22:51.502]  Unless we the people do something.
[00:22:52.423 --> 00:22:53.703]  But Fauci is going down.
[00:22:55.144 --> 00:22:57.965]  And you notice now people are learning who is controlling him, Bill Gates.
[00:22:59.585 --> 00:23:03.146]  And so this is a big moment, but the enemy is going to strike back.
[00:23:05.347 --> 00:23:06.447]  They've already beta tested.
[00:23:07.728 --> 00:23:11.389]  And it's going to be a cocktail of terror attacks,
[00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:20.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, on this Thursday, June 3rd transmission, I think we should all just slow down, take a deep breath, and cogitate, meditate, think about
[00:23:41.670 --> 00:24:02.925]  The fact, savor could be a word, but this isn't something I want to savor, though it is good, still painful, that the entire globalist program of world government, neo-feudalism, de-industrialization is coming off the rails.
[00:24:05.697 --> 00:24:13.699]  And I hardly ever drink soft drinks, but I was in such a good mood about this this morning that I got out of the refrigerator a can of dry ginger ale.
[00:24:16.699 --> 00:24:17.919]  A nice childhood drink.
[00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:23.900]  I never do things like that, but just a little treat there, even though it's crap.
[00:24:24.841 --> 00:24:27.041]  And that's really a diversion from everything, isn't it?
[00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:31.762]  It's just quite, quite a, quite a moment.
[00:24:33.308 --> 00:24:38.752]  That we're in here, but you know what the wolf says in Pulp Fiction when they think they've gotten away scot-free?
[00:24:39.433 --> 00:24:42.575]  He says, let's not start celebrating quite yet.
[00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:57.447]  He has a very crude way of saying that, because while we're looking at the fact that globalists are in trouble, and the fact that their system's falling apart, what did they do when their system was falling apart
[00:24:58.834 --> 00:25:05.435]  A year and a half ago they released a bioweapon and then you used it for psychological fear to shut down the societies that were open and free.
[00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:10.296]  And so if you think they're going to give up, think again.
[00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:18.337]  They've got a lot of different plans on the drawing board that they've now been taking off the drawing board and going into beta.
[00:25:22.398 --> 00:25:24.798]  And I'm talking about final phase beta.
[00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:27.339]  And that has been
[00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:50.005]  All of these cyber attacks that have been taking place, shutting down meatpacking, shutting down major pipelines, shutting down major shipping systems, that is 100% the globalist system doing that and
[00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:54.446]  Different countries as well joining in on it.
[00:25:54.726 --> 00:26:11.011]  The Russians, the Chinese are undoubtedly testing systems because there is a cold war taking place that is becoming a warmer and hotter war by the day.
[00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:21.138]  And so we could pore over the Fauci emails and pore over the head of his project admitting they were creating a 5-virus chimera on video.
[00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:22.779]  Well, we played that months ago.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:33.068]  And we could look at, oh, they pulled his book because it's so embarrassing off of Amazon and off of Barnes & Noble.
[00:26:34.249 --> 00:26:35.209]  The publishers did.
[00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.952]  Because it's Fauci coming out with his official story.
[00:26:39.989 --> 00:26:43.252]  And with his perjury, and it's a written record!
[00:26:45.794 --> 00:27:07.833]  Ten times worse than what he said three weeks ago in front of Senator Paul and that committee, where he said, no one's ever done gain-of-function, I've never funded it, it wasn't happening at Wuhan, when they name it gain-of-function and he orders gain-of-function and says, I want gain-of-function on specific coronaviruses.
[00:27:08.993 --> 00:27:12.297]  With gain of function, specifically combining them.
[00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:15.381]  I mean, we have the director of it talking about what they did.
[00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:24.492]  We have Fauci funding it and saying he did it in writing, in emails, in the grants, and in testimony in Congress six years ago.
[00:27:27.731 --> 00:27:39.093]  It'd be like somebody kidnapping a child off the street, taking them to a basement, and then slowly dissecting them while they're alive for a week with 50 HD cameras shooting footage of all of it.
[00:27:41.114 --> 00:27:51.056]  And then the serial killer calls the police and says, I've killed the little girl, and I dissected her, and I ate her, and then you have hundreds of hours of them doing this.
[00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:56.962]  And then CNN turns around and says he didn't torture and eat the girl.
[00:27:56.982 --> 00:27:59.304]  I mean, it's that ridiculous.
[00:28:00.565 --> 00:28:03.087]  But you say, why would they incriminate themselves?
[00:28:03.607 --> 00:28:04.868]  Why would they be out in the open?
[00:28:05.068 --> 00:28:09.932]  Because they were incriminating the NIH and the WHO and the Chinese and the U.S.
[00:28:09.972 --> 00:28:18.959]  government because they're globalists that corrupt everyone so that everyone's to blame so they can continue on with the scientific takeover.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.241]  What did they legalize last week?
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.121]  Last Tuesday, it was a minor blip on the radar.
[00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:31.923]  The United States of America, in May of 2021.
[00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:35.184]  I'm getting chills.
[00:28:37.104 --> 00:28:39.405]  Human animal splice clones.
[00:28:41.925 --> 00:28:43.526]  I told you been going on for 50 years.
[00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:47.627]  But they legalized it.
[00:28:50.529 --> 00:29:05.522]  Just like they said, hey, we could never get this gene therapy authorized because in all the studies with volunteers that killed most of them, blood clots and weird cancers and liquefying livers, strokes, heart attacks.
[00:29:07.564 --> 00:29:09.966]  Oh, because you can go in and change genes on people all day.
[00:29:09.986 --> 00:29:13.469]  You can do all sorts of stuff, but then it's going to have some bad side effects like death.
[00:29:17.014 --> 00:29:17.695]  And what did they do?
[00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:27.161]  They got authorization under emergency authorization through all these governments because Bill Gates and Fauci went around over 30 years and spent hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S.
[00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:43.213]  taxpayer money they controlled to get control of over 150 national health services from Nigeria to Australia, from India to the United States, from Canada to Germany, from Mexico to Iceland.
[00:29:46.564 --> 00:29:47.184]  To Brazil!
[00:29:47.464 --> 00:29:50.445]  Bolsonaro doesn't even control the National Medical Service there.
[00:29:52.065 --> 00:29:54.766]  And that's how you dominate, and that's how you take over.
[00:29:55.326 --> 00:30:07.828]  And so, Fauci did it all out in the open, just like Joe Biden got up a few years ago.
[00:30:07.848 --> 00:30:09.349]  Or was it night?
[00:30:09.829 --> 00:30:10.089]  It was 2018.
[00:30:12.063 --> 00:30:20.327]  On CNN, on C-SPAN, in a televised press conference, and said, they were investigating me for Burisma in Ukraine.
[00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:26.090]  So I called up when I was Vice President, and I said, there's a billion dollars being paid tonight.
[00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.073]  And if you keep that prosecutor on, you don't get the billion dollars.
[00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:34.854]  And son of a bitch, they called me an hour later, he was fired.
[00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.817]  Now, he didn't do that because he was senile then.
[00:30:41.957 --> 00:30:42.717]  He was still sharp.
[00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:47.579]  He did it to hide the crime in plain view.
[00:30:47.739 --> 00:30:57.802]  It is a con man operation with Haas, Richard N. Haas, and those other white shoe boy Harvard mafia criminals.
[00:30:59.563 --> 00:31:00.363]  But there they are.
[00:31:03.467 --> 00:31:05.050]  And so, that's where we are.
[00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.472]  And so, what's in the cards?
[00:31:06.572 --> 00:31:17.369]  Massive cyber attacks, to distract you, escalating war with China, war in the Middle East, dollar fluctuations, and race war this summer.
[00:31:18.362 --> 00:31:20.523]  Which they are in overdrive doing.
[00:31:20.903 --> 00:31:29.725]  With look at the disparities in income, and whites are racist, and massacring blacks everywhere, and white supremacy is the number one threat, and oh my god, the white people are killing the black people!
[00:31:29.905 --> 00:31:30.885]  Do something, do something!
[00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:32.866]  Stop the whites, burn everything down now!
[00:31:33.246 --> 00:31:38.587]  Hoping they can get black people to go out and be the cover for martial law by getting black folks to burn everything down.
[00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:43.349]  They are trying so hard, just like the famous Antifa documents we got from 2015 showed.
[00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:59.359]  We're Obama playing martial law, having white Antifa go out in cities across the country like Maryland, like Baltimore, and getting them to stage the burning down of buildings to use blacks as the cover for it.
[00:32:01.064 --> 00:32:01.505]  Unbelievable.
[00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:02.766]  So that's what we're facing.
[00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:05.008]  That's where we are with collapsing border.
[00:32:05.388 --> 00:32:06.729]  The Russians just dumped the U.S.
[00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:07.130]  dollar.
[00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.412]  The world is at war.
[00:32:09.452 --> 00:32:13.496]  And I'll tell you about the different factions and how I think we counter this when we come back.
[00:32:14.377 --> 00:32:22.184]  And from the vault, we've got Infowars first on TV and radio laying out, not that he said it was a leak, but that it was deliberate.
[00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:24.406]  Last January.
[00:32:24.446 --> 00:32:25.007]  Stay with us.
[00:32:25.147 --> 00:32:26.048]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:50.976]  At the beginning of the last segment I said we should all sit back and contemplate on where the world is today and how amazing it is that these horrible evil plans of the globalists are coming out because they were so arrogant they hid them in plain view and like a spell thought that they could keep us under their control but instead it's backfiring and the Emperor's new clothes don't exist.
[00:32:52.076 --> 00:32:57.857]  And if you go back to that children's parable these supposed
[00:33:00.586 --> 00:33:17.793]  Master tailors come to the little kingdom, to the Emperor's abode, and only the most moral and smart and royal and upright can see these golden threads.
[00:33:18.333 --> 00:33:23.815]  Those that are profane, those that are fallen, those that are ugly, those that are corrupt and bad and not royal cannot see.
[00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:33.519]  And so the Emperor's shown the beautiful cloak, and none of the ministers want to say they can't see it, because they're not profane.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.662]  They're not fallen, they're not bad.
[00:33:37.302 --> 00:33:40.885]  And so the Emperor thinks, well, I can't see it, but I better not say that, they'll think I'm not royal.
[00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:42.887]  So he said, oh, beautiful clothing!
[00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:52.416]  And finally, the Emperor goes out completely naked for a parade.
[00:33:55.629 --> 00:34:03.953]  And everybody freaks out, but they don't say anything because, well, you're not royal, or you're bad, or you're corrupt if you can't see the clothes.
[00:34:03.973 --> 00:34:08.835]  But finally, a three-year-old boy steps forward and says, you're not wearing anything, you're naked.
[00:34:09.175 --> 00:34:12.117]  And everybody starts laughing, and the illusion falls just like that.
[00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:32.876]  So Fauci and Gates and the UN, the New World Order, the CHICOMs, oh you better stay closed, you better never come out, oh my gosh there's no treatments for it, it's the worst things ever, and they lie, exaggerate, say we're gonna have, you know, 5 million dead, then 2 million dead, and they say it's got a 4% kill rate and a 3% kill rate, none of it was true, and then they lie on the PCR test.
[00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:35.390]  People want to be heroes.
[00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.330]  They want to wear masks.
[00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.052]  They want to stay at home and watch Netflix and drink beer because they're heroes.
[00:34:40.092 --> 00:34:41.253]  And you're not a hero.
[00:34:41.293 --> 00:34:41.993]  You should stay home.
[00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.615]  Because they tailored it that you're moral and you're good.
[00:34:44.935 --> 00:34:46.516]  You can see the gold clothing.
[00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:49.217]  You can see how good it is to wear a mask.
[00:34:50.778 --> 00:34:51.679]  And so that's where we are.
[00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:53.439]  As a civilization.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.160]  As a society.
[00:34:58.342 --> 00:35:08.313]  So you've got to be ready whenever they sell the idea that, oh, you're moral and right because you're for censorship, or you're moral and right because you want open borders, or you're moral and right because you don't question the system, that really, you're just a chump.
[00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:23.896]  But more than just sitting back and contemplating this, we should sit back and thank God and get on our knees that there is still good in the universe and that we're giving the globalists a run for their money and pray for more whistleblowers to come out and more evidence to come forward, because that's what I told you a few weeks ago was happening.
[00:35:24.376 --> 00:35:30.999]  People in the system now see what Fauci did, who were compartmentalized, and they've got all the evidence that it was premeditated.
[00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:34.181]  And when Fauci testified that he wasn't involved in gain of function,
[00:35:35.413 --> 00:35:41.698]  Even more evidence came out because people in the system know he's lying, and they weren't questioning before because Fauci's the emperor.
[00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:43.099]  He's wearing the new clothes.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:52.325]  But as soon as he got called, it gave them the moral courage to face what was really happening, and now everybody sees it for what it is.
[00:35:52.345 --> 00:35:57.109]  And we're at that collapse moment right now.
[00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:04.413]  And all the emails sent to him and him trying to cover it up and being thanked for covering it up.
[00:36:04.513 --> 00:36:05.794]  It's all smoking gun.
[00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:07.234]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:36:07.454 --> 00:36:09.375]  And it all leads back to Bill Gates, just like I told you.
[00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:14.458]  All the fawning and all the worshipping.
[00:36:14.498 --> 00:36:17.519]  The New World Order thought they could use a health scare to bring us down forever.
[00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:19.800]  And that the whole world was made up with soy boys.
[00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:21.301]  But it wasn't.
[00:36:22.568 --> 00:36:25.332]  There were still men and women that would tell the truth that were left.
[00:36:25.352 --> 00:36:27.314]  I'm going to air some of the excerpts.
[00:36:27.334 --> 00:36:30.679]  I'm not going to play it all because there's about six minutes of just quick clips.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:40.451]  How Infowars first exposed the fact that this was a purposeful bioweapon, psychological warfare weapon released from Wuhan to bring in the Great Reset.
[00:36:41.112 --> 00:36:53.275]  And then as you go through, we first report on the lab, on the virus, on how it could be a leak, and then into the fact that it was obviously, by design, flashback, watching a Thor's Breakdown, Mulan bioweapon release on January 2020.
[00:36:56.415 --> 00:37:03.657]  At Band.Video, but you can't share Band.Video because it's censored, because it tells the truth, so you're going to have to share it by the URL freeworldnews.tv.
[00:37:04.037 --> 00:37:05.918]  Freeworldnews.tv.

[00:38:29.597 --> 00:38:31.338]  Every Mind You Wake Up is very important.
[00:38:31.358 --> 00:38:33.741]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:38:34.642 --> 00:38:39.867]  And as we go into the next hour, I've got a lot of other news I'm going to hit as well that all ties into how they're going to strike back.
[00:38:40.307 --> 00:38:44.230]  Well, the race war there basically already started in this country.
[00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.991]  Very, very sad.
[00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:46.772]  We can still head this off.
[00:38:46.812 --> 00:38:49.434]  And I told you they'd soon be all over TV promoting eating bugs.
[00:38:50.034 --> 00:38:54.318]  CNN anchor now eating cicadas on TV saying it's sushi.
[00:38:55.302 --> 00:38:59.324]  That's like taking dog manure to somebody's front door and telling them it's a chocolate brownie.
[00:38:59.824 --> 00:39:01.345]  Don't piss on me and tell me it's raining.
[00:39:02.865 --> 00:39:07.827]  There's a whole plan behind all this and I'm going to explain that coming up next hour as well.
[00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:18.532]  But here's just some of David Knight and of course Harrison Smith and myself and everybody else here on air laying this out first on TV and radio last January.
[00:39:18.572 --> 00:39:18.932]  Here it is.
[00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:24.897]  New research cast doubt the coronavirus started in Wuhan food market.
[00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:25.537]  Of course it did.
[00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:28.618]  It started in a bio weapons lab.
[00:39:28.998 --> 00:39:43.402]  The real issue is maybe the Chinese lab there in the city of Wuhan, which going back two years ago, inside the Chinese lab poised to study the world's most dangerous pathogens.
[00:39:43.582 --> 00:39:48.483]  Isn't it funny how these things always kind of originate around these bio safety labs, right?
[00:39:52.628 --> 00:40:04.774]  There's also a very coincidental fact that the only high-level biolab in China is located less than 10 miles away from this wet market.
[00:40:05.074 --> 00:40:17.840]  In fact, it was founded after the SARS outbreak in 2003, and it's the only one that is capable of handling, they say, this outbreak, and it's there in Wuhan, very close to this wet market.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.504]  Because of the lab located so near to that wet market.
[00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:24.467]  In fact, you have a headline here from Nature Magazine.
[00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:29.292]  Inside the Chinese lab, poised to study the world's most dangerous pathogens.
[00:40:29.592 --> 00:40:30.834]  That is from February 2017.
[00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:35.699]  And so the suspicion is that perhaps they were
[00:40:35.979 --> 00:40:37.620]  And again, the pauses are where we put up the dates, man.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.620]  If you were spying 30 minutes ago, I...
[00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:07.890]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.830]  Maybe we can just pull it up.
[00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:20.996]  But it's, Xi admits that China's in a major crisis as fears mount that this is a man-made bioweapon.
[00:41:21.997 --> 00:41:24.798]  I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's really the, there it is.
[00:41:25.198 --> 00:41:28.380]  Sunday Live, Xi admits China in grave situation.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.422]  Fears mount virus is man-made bioweapon.
[00:41:31.882 --> 00:41:32.162]  U.S.
[00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:33.203]  orders evacuation.
[00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:35.704]  I mean, that's all from stuff being announced.
[00:41:36.795 --> 00:41:38.215]  I didn't just pull that out of the ether.
[00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:43.676]  Lancet confirms Chinese labs release coronavirus strains four times.
[00:41:44.056 --> 00:41:52.438]  We know that the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, and others have been developing weaponized versions of this.
[00:41:53.978 --> 00:42:01.820]  But that's how the US, Russia, and China get around these UN conventions, barring bioweapons, as you call it, research labs.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.000]  I mean, the really big news
[00:42:06.406 --> 00:42:11.070]  Is that the vaccines are not vaccines that are killing people in mass and the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:27.824]  We're talking to a medical doctor this morning, we're trying to get on air, who in his practice as a doctor that delivers babies, and he's saying all the women that take the vaccine are having miscarriages, all of them.
[00:42:28.444 --> 00:42:29.045]  Of course they are!
[00:42:30.222 --> 00:42:32.384]  I mean, you gotta get from baited to operational.
[00:42:32.404 --> 00:42:33.444]  They said they want to kill everybody.
[00:42:33.765 --> 00:42:47.375]  We sit here and wonder why Bill Gates maneuvered his way into control of the whole medical system worldwide, and then I just sit here on air and talk about it, and then I go and leave work and go to dinner with my wife, or I sit in the backyard with my daughter and play with her dolls.
[00:42:48.695 --> 00:42:54.099]  They're not just, you know, I'm the hero, I fight the New World Order, and everybody pats me on the back.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.700]  Pat, for what?
[00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:57.382]  Saying no to these people?
[00:42:57.762 --> 00:42:59.543]  We should be doing a lot more than that.
[00:42:59.623 --> 00:43:00.584]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.486]  And I'm not calling for violence because they'll turn themselves into victims.
[00:43:04.227 --> 00:43:06.669]  The public's too dumbed down to even know what's good for them.
[00:43:10.523 --> 00:43:11.804]  And you know, that's what it comes down to.
[00:43:11.864 --> 00:43:12.805]  Everybody says that to me.
[00:43:12.845 --> 00:43:15.366]  They go, well, then the public deserves to die.
[00:43:16.347 --> 00:43:18.448]  And maybe Bill Gates is the good guy.
[00:43:19.569 --> 00:43:22.191]  Maybe Bill is good and I'm bad.
[00:43:22.631 --> 00:43:23.412]  And I'm serious.
[00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:24.552]  Maybe.
[00:43:24.572 --> 00:43:29.356]  You know, I've thought about driving around in my armored vehicle in Austin because the left will attack me if they see me.
[00:43:29.636 --> 00:43:32.458]  So, you know, they throw bottles and rocks at us and hammers.
[00:43:34.087 --> 00:43:35.588]  People say, why are you in an armored vehicle?
[00:43:35.628 --> 00:43:37.089]  Because they attack us in regular cars.
[00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.951]  It's like going out around wild animals.
[00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:41.233]  They hate somebody trying to free them that much.
[00:43:43.575 --> 00:43:46.197]  And maybe I should just ride around telling them, take the vaccine.
[00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:47.678]  You need to die.
[00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:48.819]  You need to get out of the way.
[00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:49.499]  You're stupid.
[00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:50.480]  You're a useless eater.
[00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:53.823]  Then they get pissed and not take the vaccine.
[00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:57.466]  See, it's all reverse psychology.
[00:43:57.486 --> 00:44:02.590]  If you try to love them, and you try to help them, they don't want that.
[00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:12.367]  But if you tell them, I'm a servant of Jesus, I care about you, please don't hurt yourself, they attack you like wild animals.
[00:44:14.007 --> 00:44:15.668]  And by the way, I'm not throwing a fit here on air.
[00:44:15.808 --> 00:44:16.809]  It has nothing to do with the crew.
[00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:19.290]  They're great people putting up with me.
[00:44:20.131 --> 00:44:20.431]  I just...
[00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:24.960]  I have learned so much doing this for 27 years.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.202]  I have experienced things that really almost no one else has experienced all the things I've experienced.
[00:44:29.522 --> 00:44:33.024]  Obviously, each person's experiences are different and varied, so that's part of being human.
[00:44:33.244 --> 00:44:37.787]  But I mean, I've really seen down the rabbit hole.
[00:44:38.847 --> 00:44:48.032]  I've been down the rabbit hole and then down another rabbit hole, and I've not just been somebody that's giving you a tour of the rabbit hole, I am experiencing it
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:58.162]  First hand, so before I give you a tour of the rabbit hole, I get to go down these holes, and I get to experience what's at the other end of them.
[00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:05.965]  And a lot of times, I don't want to even get on air and tell you what is at the end of the rabbit holes, because it's not very fun.
[00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:12.446]  So, as Nietzsche said, do not stare into the abyss lest you become the abysser.
[00:45:12.726 --> 00:45:14.047]  Those that stare in the abyss too long,
[00:45:14.994 --> 00:45:19.695]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:25.677]  I'm going to try to pull up myself and get myself focused and together.
[00:45:25.697 --> 00:45:28.757]  I just can't handle being around scum and tyrants and manipulators.
[00:45:29.718 --> 00:45:30.898]  Welcome back my friends.
[00:45:31.658 --> 00:45:35.399]  There is so much news to get to and I spent most of the first hour
[00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:56.757]  Drilling into the fact that Fauci is falling and the collapse of that first domino really could bring down a large faction of what we know as the ruling class world government system and its mode of operations.
[00:46:00.698 --> 00:46:06.701]  And so I want to open the phones up throughout the next
[00:46:08.131 --> 00:46:29.063]  Three hours, because I'm going to host the fourth hour today, and we're going to take your phone calls about the state of the world and everything you see happening, unfolding, and I'm going to cover every article on my desk today, at least on the surface, but I will drill into quite a few of them deeply.
[00:46:31.207 --> 00:46:43.380]  Let me judiciously just start getting into some of the big news that fits into the larger compendium of who the ruling class is, what their worldview is, and where they're going.
[00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:49.086]  And the one thing I've learned is that there's a bunch of different factions and factions within factions.
[00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:49.887]  That's human nature.
[00:46:51.138 --> 00:47:00.447]  And the Founding Fathers knew that, so they created three systems of government, federally, three systems state level, to have six different systems competing with each other.
[00:47:00.828 --> 00:47:10.658]  Then the fourth of state, the media, to try to make sure not one group or one man ever got too much power to tie down dictators with process.
[00:47:12.031 --> 00:47:12.992]  Separation of powers.
[00:47:13.652 --> 00:47:15.673]  And that same thing happens with globalism.
[00:47:16.053 --> 00:47:17.414]  The Russians don't go along with it.
[00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.214]  The Chinese don't.
[00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:18.915]  The U.S.
[00:47:18.955 --> 00:47:19.255]  doesn't.
[00:47:19.395 --> 00:47:20.035]  India doesn't.
[00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:21.036]  Mexico doesn't.
[00:47:21.116 --> 00:47:23.537]  Nobody really follows the rules.
[00:47:24.058 --> 00:47:31.742]  Even the Germans got caught lying about how much carbon their cars were producing when they were running ads about how they had the cleanest.
[00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:42.709]  And so they're trying to get this one big centralized world government, this Tower of Babel, but right as they try to complete it, it starts falling apart.
[00:47:44.812 --> 00:47:48.578]  And so Greg Rees, who puts together a lot of amazing reports, has put together a report.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.182]  Elon Musk exposed.
[00:47:52.901 --> 00:47:55.202]  And I've been somewhat on the fence about Elon.
[00:47:55.242 --> 00:48:05.145]  He says vaccines, I don't trust them, and he loves America, and he's got a heavy lifter rocket that gets into space, and he wants humans to go to Mars and to terraform Mars, and I like that.
[00:48:05.265 --> 00:48:07.446]  Boy, that's right up my alley.
[00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:08.747]  That's what I want to hear.
[00:48:10.347 --> 00:48:15.509]  And I think Elon is an opportunist that plays both the globalist arms, but also the populist arms.
[00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.391]  And I'm going to hold up short of calling him a fraud, but
[00:48:22.418 --> 00:48:26.200]  That doesn't mean people I respect at work here can't put out their views on it.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.402]  But people always get confused when different hosts have different views.
[00:48:29.642 --> 00:48:31.563]  But we're not one monolithic group.
[00:48:32.964 --> 00:48:35.305]  We're not one monolithic organization.
[00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:36.886]  We have debates.
[00:48:37.006 --> 00:48:40.168]  We have discussions about our views and our ideas.
[00:48:40.568 --> 00:48:44.610]  But then on the other hand, Musk is promoting microchips in the brain and all the rest of it.
[00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.191]  His argument is it's going to happen anyways.
[00:48:46.531 --> 00:48:48.172]  You might as well get into it now.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.673]  You'll be an early adopter.
[00:48:50.453 --> 00:48:54.675]  Yeah, but this whole AI system is of the globalists, so anything you do isn't neutral.
[00:48:54.936 --> 00:48:56.296]  It's always got Trojan horses.
[00:48:56.716 --> 00:49:00.479]  I'm not anti-technology, but I'm anti it being deployed by these individuals.
[00:49:01.079 --> 00:49:02.620]  So the report just went live.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.181]  It's at band.video.
[00:49:04.381 --> 00:49:06.842]  You can't share stuff from band.video on Twitter or Facebook.
[00:49:07.102 --> 00:49:07.963]  That URL's blocked.

[00:49:14.696 --> 00:49:15.577]  Free World News.

[00:49:21.043 --> 00:49:24.106]  You can see it up there in the corner for TV viewers, radio listeners.

[00:49:25.768 --> 00:49:28.391]  And this is not a spectator sport.
[00:49:28.511 --> 00:49:30.613]  It is a participation sport, an info war.
[00:49:30.653 --> 00:49:32.315]  And your action is critical.
[00:49:32.355 --> 00:49:34.056]  So give us a review of this video below.
[00:49:34.417 --> 00:49:36.179]  We'll be right back with more news after this report.
[00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:53.517]  Pop culture has touted Elon Musk as some sort of eccentric heavyweight genius with humble beginnings, but this is demonstrably false.
[00:49:54.437 --> 00:50:01.662]  Elon Musk was born in South Africa, where he claims he grew up extremely poor, but his family owned an emerald mine.
[00:50:02.322 --> 00:50:10.668]  As a teenager, Elon would trade emeralds for cash in New York City, and his father bragged how they had so much money we couldn't even close our safe.
[00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:25.017]  Musk claims to have had about $100,000 of student loan debt, but he received a full scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania, where he bought a 10-bedroom frat house with his friend Adeo Ressi and ran an illegal nightclub.
[00:50:25.857 --> 00:50:28.859]  The pop culture claim is that Elon has an IQ of 155.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.964]  But this has never been tested, and after being accepted into Stanford for PhD studies, he dropped out after two days.
[00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:45.810]  After dropping out, Elon began his first business venture with his brother Kimball, Zip2, which was essentially a digital version of the Yellow Pages.
[00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.912]  The brothers received tens of thousands of dollars from their parents.
[00:50:50.452 --> 00:50:52.153]  And yet, Elon denies this.
[00:50:53.154 --> 00:50:57.196]  An associate of Elon's father, Gregg Curry, got involved to bring in investors.
[00:50:57.777 --> 00:51:03.100]  But Elon's code was no good, so they had to hire on professional coders to rewrite everything.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:10.584]  Zip2 was then sold for $307 million to Compaq, who later shut it down without ever earning a profit.
[00:51:11.584 --> 00:51:21.029]  Elon made $22 million, bought a $1 million McLaren F1 supercar, which made mainstream news, before he totaled the uninsured vehicle.
[00:51:22.029 --> 00:51:25.551]  Musk then went on to create an online bank, X.com.
[00:51:26.232 --> 00:51:30.534]  He partnered with banking expert Harris Fricker, Edward Ho, and Christopher Payne.
[00:51:31.534 --> 00:51:37.320]  All three ended up leaving the company after accusing Elon of lying to the media about the quality of their product.
[00:51:38.301 --> 00:51:40.063]  Elon claims he founded PayPal.
[00:51:40.863 --> 00:51:44.227]  Before the company was named PayPal, it was known as Confinity.
[00:51:44.988 --> 00:51:48.291]  It was founded in 1998 by Peter Thiel and Max Lefchin.
[00:51:48.952 --> 00:51:54.297]  After losing millions of dollars, Elon's X.com was bought by Confinity in a merger in 2000.
[00:51:55.858 --> 00:51:59.360]  All Musk contributed at Confinity was his own power struggle.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:04.082]  He made himself CEO and pushed to change the name to X.com.
[00:52:05.303 --> 00:52:09.645]  The executive team successfully petitioned to fire Musk while he was away on vacation.
[00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:22.191]  Part of Musk's resignation agreement stipulated that all references to founders of the company will be removed from their website, allowing Elon to claim credit, which so far is all he has ever achieved.
[00:52:23.388 --> 00:52:29.830]  Peter Thiel then rebranded the company as PayPal, went public, and sold to eBay for $1.5 billion.
[00:52:31.091 --> 00:52:38.734]  Elon made $180 million from the deal, which he then invested into Tesla, SpaceX, and failed company SolarCity.
[00:52:39.854 --> 00:52:42.435]  Elon falsely claims to be the founder of Tesla.
[00:52:43.236 --> 00:52:49.438]  Tesla was founded in 2003 by Mark Tarpening and Martin Eberhard, who developed the Tesla Roadster.
[00:52:50.774 --> 00:52:57.796]  When Tesla Motors began looking for venture capital, they approached Elon Musk, who had the fake credibility as PayPal's co-founder.
[00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:01.996]  Musk joined with the condition that he be named chairman of the board.
[00:53:03.117 --> 00:53:11.438]  In emails, Musk was upset that the media was not giving him credit for Tesla Motors and went after Martin Eberhard, replacing him as CEO.
[00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:18.560]  He then forced Eberhard out of the company and rewrote the company's history to have himself listed as an original co-founder.
[00:53:19.676 --> 00:53:25.161]  Martin Eberhard, the man behind the Tesla Roadster, was promised the first Roadster off the assembly line.
[00:53:25.841 --> 00:53:29.645]  But Musk screwed him over on that as well, and sent that car into space.
[00:53:31.647 --> 00:53:34.469]  You can tell it's real because it looks so fake, honestly.
[00:53:36.191 --> 00:53:37.492]  So who is Elon Musk?
[00:53:38.672 --> 00:53:41.974]  Elon describes his father as being an evil, abusive man.
[00:53:42.835 --> 00:53:50.599]  His father, Errol Musk, has been accused of being a pedophile and fathered a child with his stepdaughter, who is 42 years younger than him.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:54:01.126]  This spoiled, narcissistic failure, son of accused pedophile, wants to put computer chips in everyone's brain so that we can merge with artificial intelligence.
[00:54:02.847 --> 00:54:07.610]  His girlfriend is now bragging how this could all lead to a communist utopia.
[00:54:09.651 --> 00:54:19.944]  And strangely enough, former Nazi and head of NASA, Werner Von Braun, predicted a man named Elon would conquer Mars in a 1952 novel that he wrote.
[00:54:20.705 --> 00:54:26.151]  Which is odd, because NASA has partnered with Elon's SpaceX to work towards colonizing Mars.
[00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:38.765]  Elon Musk, like everything else in today's modern society, is a fraud, a fake genius, just like fake philanthropist Bill Gates and his fake vaccines.
[00:54:39.646 --> 00:54:41.227]  Brought to you by The Fake News.
[00:54:42.147 --> 00:54:45.909]  Here's a pro tip for dealing with the mainstream media and all of pop culture.
[00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:50.192]  Assume it's a lie and research everything.
[00:54:50.232 --> 00:54:52.253]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:54:53.654 --> 00:54:55.555]  Well, that is brutal!
[00:54:57.914 --> 00:54:59.415]  Give us your take on it in the comments below.
[00:54:59.435 --> 00:55:00.015]  We'll be right back.
[00:55:01.336 --> 00:55:02.616]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:02.836 --> 00:55:04.697]  Because there's a war on, for your mind.
[00:55:04.717 --> 00:55:08.939]  Alright, so I always love Greg Reese's reports, and we air them all, they're banned on video.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.820]  He said, we're going on Elon Musk one.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.661]  I said, okay, whatever.
[00:55:12.261 --> 00:55:13.481]  And so we just premiered it there.
[00:55:13.641 --> 00:55:15.422]  I hadn't watched it until we aired it.
[00:55:16.143 --> 00:55:18.544]  He was just finishing it up last night, so I hadn't had time to see it today.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.781]  And I mean, I think it's pretty brutal.
[00:55:21.041 --> 00:55:22.303]  And I think most of it's accurate.
[00:55:22.463 --> 00:55:28.889]  I think to say he's a loser that never accomplished anything, I mean, I would overall disagree with that statement.
[00:55:29.009 --> 00:55:30.490]  I mean, he got NASA to sign on.
[00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:33.173]  He got heavy lifters into space where nobody else could do it.
[00:55:33.633 --> 00:55:35.175]  That's the biggest heavy lifter in the world.
[00:55:35.255 --> 00:55:40.059]  So certainly if he was a con man, he's faking it until he makes it.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.041]  But, regardless, I like him leaving California and coming to Texas.
[00:55:44.821 --> 00:55:46.181]  I like him being against the lockdown.
[00:55:46.222 --> 00:55:49.302]  I like him being against the forced inoculation and saying he's not taking it.
[00:55:49.862 --> 00:55:51.203]  I think he plays both sides.
[00:55:51.263 --> 00:55:52.223]  I think he's an opportunist.
[00:55:52.583 --> 00:55:56.004]  But, he says, I want world socialism.
[00:55:56.044 --> 00:55:56.644]  That's horrible.
[00:55:57.004 --> 00:56:00.165]  He says, oh, he's pushing brain chips for his little kiosk at the mall.
[00:56:00.185 --> 00:56:02.466]  Remember he said two years ago, within two years it'll be happening?
[00:56:02.506 --> 00:56:02.986]  Didn't happen.
[00:56:03.446 --> 00:56:06.187]  And then he's got his girlfriend, properly named Grimes,
[00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:16.451]  And here she is talking in a video about how we're all going to be connected to AI and not have to work and do nothing.
[00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:19.211]  Well, that's, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll love it.
[00:56:19.971 --> 00:56:29.294]  You'll be hooked in like a wirehead that Philip K. Dick predicted 50 years ago, where your pleasure centers are controlled by the AI so you no longer have free will.
[00:56:29.814 --> 00:56:30.994]  That's called enslavement.
[00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:38.981]  But that's the holy grail that MIT and all of them are going for, is an experience that totally takes you over.
[00:56:39.321 --> 00:56:41.664]  A thousand times more addictive than your smartphone.
[00:56:42.145 --> 00:56:43.226]  Manipulating your dopamine.
[00:56:44.608 --> 00:56:47.771]  So, this is just extremely creepy stuff.
[00:56:47.811 --> 00:56:48.653]  Transhumanism.
[00:56:49.932 --> 00:56:55.674]  A few years ago, he says, beware AI gods, beware the globalists that want AI takeover.
[00:56:55.854 --> 00:56:58.655]  Then he says, oh, I just accept AI, let's take brain chips.
[00:56:59.275 --> 00:57:00.995]  So he plays double messages.
[00:57:01.916 --> 00:57:04.497]  And I don't think that's a good thing.
[00:57:04.537 --> 00:57:05.977]  But you know, he's famous, he's interesting.
[00:57:06.477 --> 00:57:08.978]  And so that's a discussion that we're having here.
[00:57:09.018 --> 00:57:12.539]  And I'd love to have Elon Musk on the show to give his side of the perspective.
[00:57:13.299 --> 00:57:17.460]  But going on Joe Rogan and smoking a big fat joint, it's like, oh, he's really cool.
[00:57:17.821 --> 00:57:18.681]  He's like one of us.
[00:57:20.179 --> 00:57:20.980]  That's more of a gimmick.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.741]  And I'm not putting him down for doing it.
[00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:24.422]  I've gone on Joe's show and done that myself.
[00:57:25.423 --> 00:57:26.925]  I'm not a marijuana smoker.
[00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:29.527]  Might do it literally once a year because it's so strong.
[00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:31.829]  But that's a ritual on Joe's show to do it.
[00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:35.111]  So I think I've smoked pot three times the last four years.
[00:57:35.772 --> 00:57:36.993]  Every time with Joe Rogan.
[00:57:37.433 --> 00:57:40.175]  And every time I got back, I'd be like, family court's calling!
[00:57:41.096 --> 00:57:47.901]  Uh, your ex says you're a big pothead and I'd go get drug tested and of course there'd be no marijuana in me because there was like news articles about it.
[00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:49.682]  Jones ordered for drug testing.
[00:57:50.082 --> 00:57:50.663]  No drugs!
[00:57:50.923 --> 00:57:54.725]  Because I don't take drugs other than legal ones called caffeine and alcohol.
[00:57:55.206 --> 00:57:57.047]  And I don't even really ever drink anymore either.
[00:57:57.107 --> 00:57:59.148]  So, that's, I'm kind of a boring guy.
[00:57:59.188 --> 00:58:00.829]  But enough about me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:02.911]  Here is his girlfriend.
[00:58:05.523 --> 00:58:07.064]  She's kind of a creepy person, if you ask me.
[00:58:07.104 --> 00:58:15.230]  I mean, with all these weird fake scars she has, all these weird, overhead shot please, all these weird tattoos and everything, and that's her right, it's her body.
[00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.051]  It's like a baphomet to me.
[00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:20.413]  I have my right to say I think it's creepy!
[00:58:21.434 --> 00:58:34.823]  I think putting X's on your belly and all this weird sigils or magic type stuff, and this outfit, it all smells of Satanism and Luciferian buffoonery to me, and people trying to be different, when that's how they are all acting.
[00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:38.382]  Resembles more a bunch of idiots going off the edge of a cliff.
[00:58:42.225 --> 00:58:44.026]  Here's what she has to say about the Evermind.
[00:58:44.046 --> 00:58:44.446]  Here it is.
[00:58:45.907 --> 00:58:49.449]  I have a proposition for the communists.
[00:58:49.629 --> 00:58:52.871]  Typically, most of the communists I know are not big fans of AI.
[00:58:53.507 --> 00:58:58.151]  But if you think about it, AI is actually the fastest path to communism.
[00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:04.556]  So, if implemented correctly, AI could actually theoretically solve for abundance.
[00:59:05.056 --> 00:59:13.082]  Like, we could totally get to a situation where nobody has to work, everybody is provided for with a comfortable state of being, comfortable living.
[00:59:14.023 --> 00:59:21.389]  AI could automate all the farming, weed out systematic corruption, thereby bringing us to as close as possible to genuine equality.
[00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.673]  So basically, everything that everybody loves about communism, but without the collective farm.
[00:59:27.334 --> 00:59:31.256]  Because, let's be real, enforced farming is really not a vibe.
[00:59:32.537 --> 00:59:39.842]  Well, that is extremely vapid and the whole argument is a giant fraud at every front.
[00:59:40.943 --> 00:59:43.185]  But I guess this is more of her doing her art.
[00:59:43.205 --> 00:59:46.647]  It's definitely striking art, definitely gets my attention.
[00:59:49.107 --> 00:59:52.909]  Who programs this AI to give us total equality?
[00:59:54.510 --> 01:00:00.333]  Oh, LeBron James is taller than me and stronger than me, so we've got to cut his legs off.
[01:00:00.674 --> 01:00:04.456]  Oh, you've got more money than me, so you need to give me part of it.
[01:00:05.096 --> 01:00:07.057]  Well, really, who decides who gets that money?
[01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:09.279]  There's no way to ever have equality.
[01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:14.882]  You can have equality of freedom in that you have a shot at success in the world.
[01:00:15.984 --> 01:00:20.307]  And that there's not some royal family that gets everything free who makes all the rules for you.
[01:00:20.587 --> 01:00:21.888]  That's what America is.
[01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:24.409]  It was the furthest level of freedom we ever got to.
[01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:35.997]  That's why the UN and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the New World Order attack it all day because their authoritarian systems cannot even compete with the idea of America existing.
[01:00:37.778 --> 01:00:44.883]  So America produced a little bit of freedom, but it was light years ahead of all of the
[01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:48.284]  Black holes that were authoritarian regimes.
[01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:52.409]  So picture the level of freedom like being above sea level.
[01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:55.752]  And America got to a thousand feet above sea level.
[01:00:56.854 --> 01:01:00.418]  And human freedom could be a trillion feet above sea level potentially.
[01:01:00.979 --> 01:01:02.621]  But it comes down to the individual and how we act.
[01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:06.145]  The decisions we all make individually that then adds to a collective
[01:01:07.614 --> 01:01:14.820]  Matrix type system, but that's in God's mind through our free will, interfacing with God, not directed by some AI system.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:25.289]  And then picture the Soviet Union or Hitler or Mao Zedong as a wormhole to hell that is trillions of miles below sea level.
[01:01:27.222 --> 01:01:33.945]  So, everyone was shooting to get out of hell, and just the idea of private property and freedom for some was new.
[01:01:34.705 --> 01:01:41.528]  And then from that, it extrapolated more and more freedom, until the globalists invert that and say, no, anyone having freedom is taking away from those that don't.
[01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:47.890]  So let's lower the standard of freedom worldwide and globalism, so that we're all equally miserable, but we're not really.
[01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:55.593]  The globalists are then flying around in their private jets in their huge manors above us, while we live in coffin apartments and are called obsolete, non-essential.
[01:01:56.769 --> 01:02:05.535]  The world they're building, you have nothing, you own nothing, you're non-essential, robots tell you what to do, your force will be inoculated with poisons, and they call that a utopia?
[01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:21.767]  With some 20-year-old dimwit hopping around, telling you that, you know, I'm incredible, I ride around in cars with a sword in my hands, and I have high-heeled shoes, and I wear tinfoil.
[01:02:22.328 --> 01:02:23.008]  Wow!
[01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:24.930]  Tinfoil jetpacks!
[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.331]  Man, there's the future!
[01:02:27.652 --> 01:02:28.592]  It's all right there!
[01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.994]  And oh, she's got a snake!
[01:02:31.134 --> 01:02:32.315]  Oh, the forbidden knowledge!
[01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:35.537]  I've never heard of this before!
[01:02:36.618 --> 01:02:42.222]  If it hadn't been force-fed to me trillions of times, and you know what happens when I'm force-fed something?
[01:02:42.742 --> 01:02:42.962]  Ugh!
[01:02:44.163 --> 01:02:48.906]  You couldn't pay me to be anywhere around that or near that.
[01:02:49.347 --> 01:02:50.888]  And all she is, is like the light
[01:02:52.389 --> 01:03:04.438]  On an anglerfish trying to suck in the young people because maybe when they launch their brain chip company, whatever actually gets off the ground, they can fool some 18 year old meth heads to put chips in their brains.
[01:03:05.679 --> 01:03:13.265]  And then they'll think the infections and the ooze coming out the back of their head is cool when they're constantly having to go in to be upgraded and everything.
[01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.986]  They'll all drown in their own evil.
[01:03:20.526 --> 01:03:21.207]  There's Elon.
[01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:24.728]  See, Greg's being too brutal.
[01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:27.649]  I thought we could actually put Elon's spirit on TV.
[01:03:28.409 --> 01:03:30.410]  And just, oh, look at little Elon.
[01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:32.751]  There's his girlfriend out there riding along up top.
[01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:34.031]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:34.051 --> 01:03:35.732]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.853]  Tomorrow's news today, we have Elon Musk on the show.
[01:03:37.873 --> 01:03:38.333]  Look, there he is.
[01:03:39.754 --> 01:03:43.195]  Breaking news, China's issuing more nuclear war threats.
[01:03:44.534 --> 01:03:53.281]  Breaking news, China is issuing more threats to attack the United States with nuclear weapons.
[01:03:54.282 --> 01:03:54.902]  China is.
[01:03:56.283 --> 01:04:04.790]  If we don't bow to them and stop investigating the Wuhan lab, I mean, that's the crazy world we've gotten ourselves into.
[01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:11.396]  That makes me just want to go off the air and go home and see my family and just move out of the city in case there's a nuclear war.
[01:04:11.416 --> 01:04:11.856]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:13.257 --> 01:04:32.203]  That's really what it is, is trying to analyze how I feel about Joe Biden and the globalists and Fauci and Bill Gates and their horrible power grabbing and the schemes they launched to get control that then spiral out of control and destroy everything.
[01:04:35.694 --> 01:04:37.976]  Yeah, they're now saying we're in a new Cold War with China.
[01:04:38.036 --> 01:04:41.339]  Now, we've been in a Cold War with China for a long time, and we've been losing it.
[01:04:41.699 --> 01:04:44.722]  We've been in a trade war with China for 35 years and been losing it.
[01:04:45.202 --> 01:04:47.884]  And the surrender ended with Trump.
[01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:54.330]  And now we've got this, a new world order being formed before our eyes.
[01:04:55.311 --> 01:04:59.935]  Russia's Deputy Defense Minister tells RT out of key Moscow security conference.
[01:05:02.853 --> 01:05:06.796]  I mean, the New York Times said if you talk about the New World Order, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:05:06.816 --> 01:05:13.783]  If you talk about the Wuhan link, you're anti-Chinese.
[01:05:14.603 --> 01:05:17.045]  No, I'm just anti-biowar, I'm anti-dying.
[01:05:18.527 --> 01:05:24.292]  And again, it's always the ADL and the media that inject, like, I'm for America and sovereignty.
[01:05:24.452 --> 01:05:25.513]  Oh, you're a Nazi.
[01:05:26.579 --> 01:05:26.939]  Uh, what?
[01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:29.680]  Oh, I, uh, for freedom of speech.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.620]  Oh, you're a Nazi.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.281]  Oh, I'm against world government.
[01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:34.161]  Oh, you're a Nazi.
[01:05:35.961 --> 01:05:37.481]  Oh, that's code for Jews.
[01:05:38.202 --> 01:05:39.582]  Uh, you're the one talking about Jews.
[01:05:40.242 --> 01:05:46.223]  You're the one sticking Jews in the middle of every issue and using it as a shield.
[01:05:46.844 --> 01:05:48.884]  And people are sick of it.
[01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:52.633]  Europeans are sick of it.
[01:05:52.693 --> 01:05:53.614]  Jews are sick of it.
[01:05:53.674 --> 01:05:54.654]  Muslims are sick of it.
[01:05:55.014 --> 01:05:56.034]  Christians are sick of it.
[01:05:56.475 --> 01:05:57.795]  Everybody's sick of it.
[01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:58.575]  Sick of it.
[01:05:58.815 --> 01:06:08.618]  Just like Biden hiding behind black people and that he loves black people and the number one threat's all the white supremacists that are gonna kill everybody.
[01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:19.622]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden, you know, I did a search for this yesterday because I remember when I watched Judge Joe Brown talk about how Biden would give speeches
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:25.732]  Saying black people are like roaches and like animals and like a jungle.
[01:06:25.852 --> 01:06:28.073]  Did you know I actually found newspaper clippings?
[01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:40.759]  I actually found newspaper clippings in about 30 seconds in major newspapers at the time that ran what Joe Biden said.
[01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:44.240]  Because, you know, back then there were cameras everywhere.
[01:06:45.921 --> 01:06:47.962]  Or there were cameras, they didn't get archived on the Internet.
[01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:53.089]  So stuff up until about 1990 or so we don't have unless it was a really big event.
[01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:55.690]  It's hard to find major speeches presidents gave.
[01:06:56.070 --> 01:07:03.613]  But he went around the country in the 70s and 80s giving speeches calling black people zoo animals and I was even able to find it.
[01:07:05.253 --> 01:07:08.314]  You know what Donald Trump was doing with black people in the 1980s?
[01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:11.756]  They were staying at his house and headlining his clubs.
[01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:24.862]  And they were loving him and putting him in all their music because he opened the doors up for them in the 60s and 70s to his clubs and his businesses.
[01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.223]  And what does he get now?
[01:07:26.623 --> 01:07:33.008]  A parade of black people saying how racist he is and then kissing the ass of somebody that calls you an animal.
[01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:35.310]  That pisses me off.
[01:07:36.871 --> 01:07:38.372]  And I'm not even here defending Trump.
[01:07:38.652 --> 01:07:40.553]  I'm defending the truth!
[01:07:41.533 --> 01:07:42.973]  And that's what I'm, I'm not complaining.
[01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:44.434]  I just know too much.
[01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:50.135]  You know, I don't even want to reach into this stack I got right here and pull out the news clip he's already had to look at last night.
[01:07:51.436 --> 01:08:00.718]  With his ugly ass head and that stupid duck tail, exactly like Judge Joe Brown said, like looking at him with that stupid ass mullet!
[01:08:01.983 --> 01:08:13.533]  A freaking lunatic that's like a real-life Ricky Bobby with a huge foot-long blonde mullet running around talking about how... Pull up Biden with a mullet.
[01:08:13.573 --> 01:08:14.774]  That picture with him with Bill Clinton.
[01:08:16.395 --> 01:08:18.637]  Because he was even giving these speeches, yeah, in the early 1990s.
[01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:25.315]  A con man lawyer with a mullet saying black people are animals?
[01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:27.436]  And then I gotta kiss his ass?
[01:08:27.817 --> 01:08:30.139]  And I gotta watch black people kiss his ass?
[01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.420]  I'm sick of this!
[01:08:32.601 --> 01:08:33.982]  And I'm sick of Fauci!
[01:08:34.183 --> 01:08:35.504]  And I'm sick of Bill Gates!
[01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:39.107]  And I'm sick of the new Black Panther Party rolling around wanting a war!
[01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:41.930]  You'll get a war, you'll get your asses all killed!
[01:08:45.103 --> 01:08:53.166]  You already are getting killed, new Black Panther dumbasses, by the New World Order, but you don't care about that.
[01:08:54.627 --> 01:08:56.087]  Look at that greasy lawyer.
[01:08:56.327 --> 01:08:57.688]  Would you hire Joe Biden?
[01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:04.110]  No, he looks like a serial killer, because he is.
[01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:14.334]  And he is a sex maniac pervert that will have sex with anything that's got a hole in it.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.801]  He'll have sex with your mailbox if he could.
[01:09:24.163 --> 01:09:26.044]  Let's just go to break with some of the clips they got.
[01:09:26.064 --> 01:09:28.586]  The pause you hear is when they put the data up for radio stations.
[01:09:29.186 --> 01:09:36.010]  Obviously can't see that, but here's some clips of us back in January saying it's a bio weapon, not a leak.
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:37.251]  Bio weapon!
[01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:41.086]  Then we'll come back with all the big news, and I'll get the number out, and I'm gonna settle down.
[01:09:41.866 --> 01:09:44.868]  Or I may have to go off air, because I can't physically blow up.
[01:09:44.928 --> 01:09:46.048]  It makes me too exhausted later.
[01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:47.709]  I'm about to start blowing up on air.
[01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:50.471]  I know it's entertaining, but it's not fun for me, okay?
[01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:52.672]  But I can't look at Elon Musk, girlfriend.
[01:09:52.692 --> 01:09:53.753]  I can't look at Joe Biden.
[01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.954]  I can't look at the new Black Panther Party.
[01:09:56.514 --> 01:09:57.415]  I can't look at him!
[01:09:57.635 --> 01:09:58.536]  I can't look at Fauci!
[01:09:58.556 --> 01:10:00.997]  Because I'm gonna say things that'll get me arrested!
[01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:03.959]  Go ahead and play the clips.
[01:10:03.979 --> 01:10:05.480]  30 minutes to go.
[01:10:07.423 --> 01:10:08.404]  I forget the exact title.
[01:10:08.464 --> 01:10:09.425]  Maybe we can just pull it up.
[01:10:09.485 --> 01:10:21.495]  But it's, Xi admits that China's in a major crisis as fears mount that this is a man-made bioweapon.
[01:10:22.515 --> 01:10:25.338]  I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's, really, there it is.
[01:10:25.718 --> 01:10:26.499]  Sunday Live.
[01:10:26.519 --> 01:10:28.921]  Xi admits China in grave situation.
[01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:31.963]  Fears mount virus is man-made bioweapon.
[01:10:32.424 --> 01:10:32.684]  U.S.
[01:10:32.764 --> 01:10:33.745]  orders evacuation.
[01:10:34.205 --> 01:10:36.247]  I mean, that's all from stuff being announced.
[01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:38.683]  I didn't just pull that out of the ether.
[01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:44.211]  Landsat confirms Chinese labs released coronavirus strains four times.
[01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:52.923]  We know that the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, and others have been developing weaponized versions of this.
[01:10:54.482 --> 01:10:57.984]  But that's how the U.S., Russia, and China get around these U.N.
[01:10:58.044 --> 01:11:02.347]  conventions, barring bioweapons, as you call it, research labs.
[01:11:03.188 --> 01:11:08.852]  It looks to me like this is a deliberate bioweapon that was accidentally released.
[01:11:09.272 --> 01:11:16.117]  So I believe, based on what I know now, that China was developing a bioweapon to eventually deploy against the United States.
[01:11:16.517 --> 01:11:18.178]  Or there are other enemies around the world.
[01:11:18.558 --> 01:11:21.899]  However, this bioweapon got out in their own backyard.
[01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:24.480]  They did not intend to release it on their own people.
[01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.961]  And now they're paying the price for playing with fire.
[01:11:27.302 --> 01:11:31.143]  I called my sources that, I mean, it's not like I work for the CIA, folks.
[01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:34.465]  The CIA is just a big, giant government agency with all these other compartments.
[01:11:34.745 --> 01:11:36.345]  But there's people in there that have information.
[01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:39.507]  And they said, people that have given me good information before, they said, no.
[01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:42.108]  Our word is, this is a Chinese bioweapon.
[01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:44.540]  Exactly what you just said.
[01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:53.387]  In fact, before you told me that, separately from my sources, inside the Central Intelligence Agency, saying the same thing.
[01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:06.557]  It's now being confirmed that this coronavirus was being weaponized and studied in labs in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, you name it.
[01:12:06.957 --> 01:12:09.899]  And that the CHICOMS got caught stealing it out of labs.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.981]  And so the big takeaway is,
[01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:24.453]  Why are all these labs around the world weaponizing viruses, quote, to study them, or, oh, in case it ever mutates, they've got the weaponized virus and can make a vaccine out of it?
[01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:42.364]  Because the cover for bioweapons production is research into countering bioweapons, and that's how Russia, China, the United States, the UK, that's how all these nuclear powers and biological weapon powers have gotten around it, is research.
[01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:44.940]  Defense research.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.561]  It's not defense research.
[01:12:47.381 --> 01:12:48.222]  And it's madness.
[01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:55.167]  And of course now it's coming out that most experts believe it's a engineered bioweapon.
[01:12:55.487 --> 01:12:57.048]  And that's in the medical reports.
[01:12:57.728 --> 01:13:03.512]  You know, the last four releases of SARS that killed a lot of people were out of Chinese labs.
[01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:08.175]  New research cast doubt the coronavirus started in Wuhan food market.
[01:13:08.195 --> 01:13:08.836]  Of course it did.
[01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:10.337]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[01:13:11.894 --> 01:13:24.232]  I'm going to give the number out for first-time callers on the Wuhan purposeful bioweapon release by Fauci, the weapon he paid for, the weapon he tested, then the deadly vaccines he tested as the real kill switch.
[01:13:25.885 --> 01:13:32.427]  I'm going to open the phones up about all the race war that Joe Biden is pushing massively and so much more.
[01:13:32.547 --> 01:13:40.849]  Any topic you want to raise, any area you want to get into, China threatening nuclear war, what you think the globalists are going to do next to try to distract us.
[01:13:41.009 --> 01:13:43.830]  Obviously, the hack attacks are a deep state operation.
[01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:51.572]  They've admitted that would be part of their plan to de-industrialize the West and shut us down and consolidate power, just like the shutdown tripled their profits.
[01:13:51.592 --> 01:13:52.692]  It was doubled, now it's tripled.
[01:13:53.612 --> 01:13:56.794]  Everybody else went bankrupt or lost their job or got deep in debt.
[01:13:58.235 --> 01:13:59.296]  They got more powerful.
[01:13:59.336 --> 01:14:02.438]  Well, it's the same thing with all these hack attacks and the rest of it.
[01:14:02.558 --> 01:14:06.441]  I want to take your calls for the next two hours here today.
[01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:07.722]  I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[01:14:08.442 --> 01:14:11.544]  That's more than two hours left in this live Thursday transmission.
[01:14:11.564 --> 01:14:12.285]  I got a lot of news.
[01:14:12.785 --> 01:14:15.226]  I'm going to hit in the meantime and in between as well.
[01:14:15.867 --> 01:14:17.308]  I'll tell you about some of that news in a moment.
[01:14:18.561 --> 01:14:20.683]  But the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:14:20.703 --> 01:14:20.923]  877-789-Alex.
[01:14:20.943 --> 01:14:20.983]  877-789-2539.
[01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:21.243]  877-789-Alex.
[01:14:21.263 --> 01:14:21.884]  First-time callers.
[01:14:22.064 --> 01:14:26.127]  And if you're calling from another country, sometimes 1-800 numbers don't work, just dial your country access code.
[01:14:26.147 --> 01:14:26.207]  011-512-646-1776.
[01:14:26.227 --> 01:14:26.307]  512-646-1776.
[01:14:26.407 --> 01:14:27.568]  And we will take your calls.
[01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:28.469]  First-time callers.
[01:14:48.504 --> 01:14:49.385]  And I'm going to get to everybody.
[01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.589]  All right, let me tell you, let me tell you about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:56.432]  This is not an InfoWars product.
[01:14:58.373 --> 01:15:04.719]  But, and I'm only telling you this, not to brag, but to tell you the providence of it and why I know it works so well.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:12.607]  Five years ago, I got to know a major petroleum engineer and
[01:15:14.215 --> 01:15:23.081]  Who was involved at the highest levels with the development, you've heard about it, the bacteria that eat, they eat hair, they eat paper, they eat grass, they eat oil.
[01:15:23.601 --> 01:15:25.482]  They're natural, but they've been specially bred.
[01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:38.270]  Can I ask, why isn't that available for like people's septic tanks and people's drains and people's, you know, RV toilet systems and, you know, they've gotten gunked up even though you pump them, stuff gets in there and it needs to be eaten up.
[01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:41.893]  They said just big oil company that owns it doesn't
[01:15:44.062 --> 01:15:50.206]  Even care about the consumer market because they sell so many thousands of tons of it to the other oil companies and the pig farmers, everybody else.
[01:15:51.267 --> 01:15:54.910]  So I said, wow, that's too bad, because you know, though, I own part of the patent.
[01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.452]  So, you know, I could actually have that right.
[01:15:57.772 --> 01:15:58.572]  We went and checked it.
[01:15:58.632 --> 01:15:59.133]  They did.
[01:15:59.233 --> 01:15:59.933]  It's all true.
[01:16:00.314 --> 01:16:01.414]  For years, I said they should do it.
[01:16:01.434 --> 01:16:05.437]  I finally threw a fit two years ago because they're listeners and I know them, they're friends.
[01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:06.398]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:16:09.215 --> 01:16:10.296]  I finally got him to do it.
[01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:13.719]  And I finally got him to build a little factory and put in their own facility.
[01:16:13.959 --> 01:16:16.281]  Because this isn't done at the oil company facility in Houston.
[01:16:17.362 --> 01:16:18.083]  We buy it from them.
[01:16:19.964 --> 01:16:20.405]  From him.
[01:16:21.186 --> 01:16:24.108]  And then it's a subcompany bringing this to you.
[01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.130]  So we're very excited about it.
[01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:28.452]  And already a lot of big review groups have gotten it.
[01:16:28.472 --> 01:16:30.173]  People are wondering, wow, how'd you do this?
[01:16:30.974 --> 01:16:31.795]  Just the grace of God.
[01:16:31.875 --> 01:16:33.116]  But nobody else has this.
[01:16:33.136 --> 01:16:35.038]  Never been brought to the consumer market.
[01:16:36.241 --> 01:16:39.603]  And again, half the cost of each bag is what I got to pay the oil company to get it.
[01:16:40.044 --> 01:16:50.431]  Once we prove that it's successful with this other company that's launching this, you know, we hope to lower the price some, but it's well worth it at $55 a bag because a lot of research and stuff goes into it.
[01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:52.712]  And it just, it lives in your septic tank.
[01:16:52.752 --> 01:16:54.694]  You know, we say it lasts a year, probably lasts longer.
[01:16:54.714 --> 01:16:57.155]  You have to keep adding enzymes all the time.
[01:16:57.576 --> 01:16:58.796]  It's up to a hundred times better.
[01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:01.138]  And really it works in a bunch of other stuff as well.
[01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.219]  But this is for septic.
[01:17:02.259 --> 01:17:03.780]  It's got the instructions for septic.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.141]  You put it right down the toilet.
[01:17:06.673 --> 01:17:08.354]  And people said, why aren't you selling on InfoWars?
[01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:10.576]  It's their own company, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:11.357 --> 01:17:17.941]  And again, it took a lot of doing to get this, it's come to market, and we're now getting insane reviews.
[01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:22.365]  So it's TheBiosepticPro at TheBiopros.com.
[01:17:22.865 --> 01:17:25.267]  TheBiopros.com.
[01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:26.448]  TheBiopros.com.
[01:17:29.918 --> 01:17:33.981]  And yes, next they're getting operators set up and people to answer your calls and answer questions.
[01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:36.402]  They've already got one person hired to do that.
[01:17:36.803 --> 01:17:43.367]  So this is a big product from a big company, but we have totally gotten a separate group involved with it to set up a subsidiary.
[01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:48.311]  And so that's what we do around here is we get products and we trailblaze with them.
[01:17:49.246 --> 01:17:54.668]  This is amazing, and it then funds the Infowar as well.
[01:17:55.709 --> 01:18:05.693]  But like I said, the big oil company that holds the patent gets half the money, then the guy that owns part of that patent, he gets a little bit, and by the time we sell it, we're bringing in some money to fund ourselves, but not that much.
[01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:11.356]  I'm just excited to get this product out there, and I believe it's going to be a great hit, and it's already showing that it is.
[01:18:12.296 --> 01:18:13.479]  Check this out today.
[01:18:13.539 --> 01:18:15.523]  It's another American success story.
[01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:17.468]  Thebiopros.com.
[01:18:17.508 --> 01:18:19.352]  Thebiopros.com.
[01:18:19.392 --> 01:18:20.334]  Thebiopros.com.
[01:18:22.628 --> 01:18:26.771]  And it's right there for you to get and to experience.
[01:18:26.811 --> 01:18:37.981]  And there's about four other products coming out in the next few months that are packaged differently and delivered a little bit differently for your trains, for your RVs, for your boat, and for a bunch of other stuff.
[01:18:38.461 --> 01:18:39.782]  Grease traps, you name it.
[01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:45.246]  Farms, ponds, I mean, this stuff's crazy, man.
[01:18:46.317 --> 01:18:46.778]  It's crazy.
[01:18:46.798 --> 01:18:49.600]  You can put it in a foggy pond and then the pond clears up.
[01:18:50.521 --> 01:18:52.443]  It is serious business.
[01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:55.226]  And so it's probiotics for your septic tank.
[01:18:55.606 --> 01:19:00.211]  BioSepticPro at TheBioPros.com.
[01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:03.434]  We're really, really, really proud to be able to bring that to you.
[01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:06.878]  Separately, store-wide free shipping is going to end.
[01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:11.944]  This Sunday, with double Patriot points, the big Memorial Day special extended will end.
[01:19:12.364 --> 01:19:14.726]  DNA Force Plus sold out for seven months, 40% off.
[01:19:15.386 --> 01:19:24.392]  The Alexa Pure Breeze air filter and Alexa Pure Pro water filter, very high-end, highest rated, but all the costs cut out, basically.
[01:19:24.412 --> 01:19:26.454]  $50 off on those makes those just insanely good deals.
[01:19:26.874 --> 01:19:28.015]  Pazzo Beats back in stock.
[01:19:28.075 --> 01:19:29.836]  Ultra 12 back in stock, about 50% off.
[01:19:30.236 --> 01:19:31.277]  Alva Power, same thing.

[01:19:33.178 --> 01:19:34.859]  Pollen Block back in stock, 40% off.
[01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:36.661]  Infowarstore.com, the iconic
[01:19:37.341 --> 01:19:42.686]  Double iconic, double magnesium fizzy drink for all your body cells and everything else.
[01:19:43.046 --> 01:19:44.027]  Like, I need to take some of that.
[01:19:44.107 --> 01:19:44.948]  I'm in a bad mood today.
[01:19:44.988 --> 01:19:46.629]  That always needs to be calmed.
[01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:48.611]  I'm not complaining.
[01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:49.192]  I'm not bitching.
[01:19:49.212 --> 01:19:50.453]  I'm just telling you that I am pissed.
[01:19:50.473 --> 01:19:51.854]  And I know, I know you're pissed.
[01:19:51.894 --> 01:19:55.217]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[01:19:55.397 --> 01:19:58.460]  Okay, now let me as your calls pour in and I can't wait to go to them.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.761]  Settle down a little bit now.
[01:20:00.522 --> 01:20:01.423]  I'll be a good beaver.
[01:20:03.191 --> 01:20:03.351]  Yes.
[01:20:24.502 --> 01:20:32.546]  This huge development around where all these people are drowning in their own swimming pools and adults don't know how to save them.
[01:20:33.226 --> 01:20:38.249]  And statistically, 40% of whites in America don't know how to swim.
[01:20:38.589 --> 01:20:39.029]  60% of blacks.
[01:20:39.069 --> 01:20:40.089]  You talk about a problem.
[01:20:41.710 --> 01:20:44.391]  You talk about systemic cultural inequality.
[01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:49.950]  Where's all the left trying to get black folks to learn how to swim, or white people for that matter?
[01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:53.952]  And white folks used to know how to swim at a higher level, but they're all growing up in high-rises now.
[01:20:54.433 --> 01:21:05.019]  Everybody is so domesticated now in these urban wildernesses of swimming pools and gyms and restaurants and places to buy food, because that's a real, urban deserts are real.
[01:21:06.079 --> 01:21:12.143]  And I saw this story out of Waldorf, Maryland, where they're at this backyard pool party,
[01:21:13.294 --> 01:21:15.695]  And the kid goes in and drowns.
[01:21:15.715 --> 01:21:16.936]  The dad tries to save him and drowns.
[01:21:17.216 --> 01:21:18.696]  The fire department gets there and can't swim.
[01:21:18.736 --> 01:21:19.557]  They all start rounding.
[01:21:19.817 --> 01:21:20.937]  Ten people almost died.
[01:21:21.078 --> 01:21:21.558]  Two dead!
[01:21:22.518 --> 01:21:25.039]  And that's an example of my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.360]  And that shows the domestication.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:32.683]  Because black folks, when they used to have separate but equal, which wasn't equal, they didn't get swimming pools in their neighborhoods.
[01:21:33.003 --> 01:21:33.703]  Municipal pools.
[01:21:34.484 --> 01:21:37.125]  And folks didn't have swimming pools until like 80 years ago in the U.S.
[01:21:37.165 --> 01:21:37.505]  period.
[01:21:37.765 --> 01:21:38.405]  It's very rare.
[01:21:38.865 --> 01:21:40.586]  So black folks never grew up around swimming pools.
[01:21:40.986 --> 01:21:41.487]  In the cities.
[01:21:42.587 --> 01:21:44.608]  Same a lot with a lot of white people, but black folks even more.
[01:21:44.628 --> 01:21:50.251]  So there's an epidemic of black folks and white people that drown because they don't know how to swim.
[01:21:51.092 --> 01:21:52.092]  But, oh, you don't hear about that.
[01:21:52.112 --> 01:21:53.533]  You hear about George Floyd all day.
[01:21:53.553 --> 01:22:00.117]  But that's a perfect example of, imagine, the fire department shows up and can't swim, and then everybody starts dying.
[01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:05.680]  It's not like a Monty Python skit, but it doesn't make you laugh.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:06.480]  It makes you cry.
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.982]  But at a certain level, what in the world is going on there?
[01:22:10.002 --> 01:22:11.623]  And then we've got
[01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.108]  In fact, I'm going to hit this first.
[01:22:15.369 --> 01:22:21.953]  Remember I told you they'll be on the news soon saying you've got to eat bugs or you're a right winger and you're not a good person and you're hurting the earth.
[01:22:22.393 --> 01:22:26.796]  Well, sure as the sun came up, they're all over TV eating bugs.
[01:22:26.896 --> 01:22:30.979]  And I'm going to explain the rest of the story behind that first.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.101]  And people are like, man, we got nuclear war with China coming up.
[01:22:34.141 --> 01:22:35.542]  They're confirming it's a bio attack.
[01:22:35.862 --> 01:22:36.983]  Why are you talking about eating bugs?
[01:22:37.063 --> 01:22:39.045]  Because it's a big part of it.
[01:22:39.838 --> 01:22:44.341]  And they got those paid mercenaries on CNN up there eating the bugs.
[01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:49.104]  This isn't like a Fear Factor stunt, you know, just to geek out and get people to tune in.
[01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:49.825]  This is the future.
[01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:53.767]  They're already talking about making school lunch program kids eat bugs.
[01:22:54.368 --> 01:22:55.128]  You will have nothing.
[01:22:55.148 --> 01:22:55.749]  You will own nothing.
[01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:56.449]  You will eat bugs.
[01:22:56.469 --> 01:22:57.750]  You will drink sewage.
[01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:59.991]  And you will like it!
[01:23:00.752 --> 01:23:03.274]  So hour number three and four coming up.
[01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:05.055]  And yes, this Saturday.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:13.691]  I'm taping a three-hour marathon transmission on a very special topic that will air then at 6 p.m.
[01:23:13.892 --> 01:23:14.372]  Saturday.
[01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.718]  And we're going to have a bunch of big guests.
[01:23:17.758 --> 01:23:23.522]  I'm going to leave it at that until I tell you who the guests are tomorrow, but I want to... The guests are set up, but I want to make sure it's all done.
[01:23:24.003 --> 01:23:25.343]  And then I'll tell you about the big show.
[01:23:25.424 --> 01:23:26.124]  Very important topic.
[01:23:27.105 --> 01:23:27.505]  6 p.m.
[01:23:27.605 --> 01:23:29.406]  Saturday night that will take... Saturday.
[01:23:29.907 --> 01:23:30.347]  Saturday.
[01:23:30.947 --> 01:23:31.268]  And hey!
[01:23:31.588 --> 01:23:32.969]  I'm hosting the War Room tomorrow!
[01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:34.270]  Putting in double duty!
[01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:35.351]  I'm Alex Jones!
[01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:36.812]  This is the InfoWar!
[01:23:38.133 --> 01:23:39.554]  We're not taking it lying down.
[01:23:42.516 --> 01:23:43.997]  Fauci and Gates are going down.
[01:23:46.547 --> 01:23:48.888]  Make no mistake, you don't kill millions of people and get away with it.
[01:23:51.008 --> 01:23:53.729]  Their plan is the total destruction of human life on this planet.
[01:23:54.589 --> 01:23:58.991]  And now as people wake up to that horror, it's Fauci's doom, not ours, that looms.
[01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:00.951]  But here's a very important report.
[01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:03.712]  He used to say that people were laughing at David Icke and myself and others.
[01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:06.513]  They're not laughing with you, David, but now they are.
[01:24:06.573 --> 01:24:07.913]  Here it is.
[01:24:07.953 --> 01:24:08.913]  They're laughing at you.
[01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:10.454]  They're not laughing with you.
[01:24:13.035 --> 01:24:27.523]  I remember my daughter Kerry saying to me, you know, Dad, one day I'm going to be able to walk down Union Street and I'm going to be able to say, my dad's not mad.
[01:24:27.803 --> 01:24:30.405]  Look at what he said.
[01:24:30.585 --> 01:24:31.445]  Look at what he's having.
[01:24:32.205 --> 01:24:32.806]  He was right.
[01:24:37.745 --> 01:24:43.770]  I've been so kind to everyone, so patient.
[01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:46.132]  No, no, no, no.
[01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:48.114]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:48.174 --> 01:24:52.097]  Have a picture with me.
[01:24:52.197 --> 01:24:53.679]  Of course, yeah.
[01:24:53.699 --> 01:24:54.179]  Which one?
[01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:54.980]  That one?
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:55.780]  Yeah.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.841]  Who's it for?
[01:24:56.861 --> 01:24:56.981]  Joe.
[01:25:15.721 --> 01:25:16.362]  You're mine.
[01:25:16.782 --> 01:25:18.783]  Brilliant work you're doing.
[01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:19.643]  Thank you.
[01:25:19.703 --> 01:25:20.964]  Oh, it's all yours.
[01:25:20.984 --> 01:25:22.025]  David, we love you.
[01:25:22.165 --> 01:25:23.546]  Can we get a selfie?
[01:25:23.566 --> 01:25:24.526]  You're so amazing.
[01:25:24.566 --> 01:25:24.986]  Go on then.
[01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:26.807]  Well done, we love you.
[01:25:26.987 --> 01:25:28.488]  Thank you so much.
[01:25:28.508 --> 01:25:30.790]  Thank you.
[01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:31.850]  Thank you.
[01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:36.713]  Cheers mate, I've been following you for years.
[01:25:36.753 --> 01:25:37.793]  Cheers mate.
[01:25:37.994 --> 01:25:38.394]  Cheers.
[01:25:38.454 --> 01:25:38.994]  Thank you.
[01:25:42.293 --> 01:25:45.035]  But how good does that feel to say that they're not laughing at you now?
[01:25:45.115 --> 01:25:46.216]  They're not laughing at me now.
[01:25:46.236 --> 01:25:46.916]  No they're not!
[01:25:46.936 --> 01:25:48.177]  They're trying to ignore me.
[01:25:48.397 --> 01:25:59.885]  The sight of these people, in these vast numbers, walking through the London streets, saying we're not having it anymore, it's so freaking emotional, you know?
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:20.412]  You know, I've done some things in my life, but this is an incredible day for me to have seen all those years ago, those decades ago, where no one wanted to know and everything you said was crazy.
[01:26:20.492 --> 01:26:24.194]  And now you see the world waking up on this scale.
[01:26:24.255 --> 01:26:27.057]  So, you know, the whole COVID era has
[01:26:28.257 --> 01:26:41.526]  It has been a fascistic nightmare, but it has woken people up to the fact that there are forces running human society that are not the people they see.
[01:26:41.686 --> 01:26:45.189]  And we have an opportunity now to turn that
[01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:50.952]  Seeing that, into ceasing to cooperate with it.
[01:26:51.032 --> 01:27:02.258]  And if the kind of numbers we're starting to see cease to cooperate with the diktats of authority and fascism, then the numbers alone mean it cannot prevail.
[01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:06.920]  So this is a fantastic, pivotal day.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:13.603]  And a day that gives you enormous encouragement for where we go from here.
[01:27:16.052 --> 01:27:16.512]  Hey!
[01:27:16.572 --> 01:27:17.193]  How are you, man?
[01:27:17.253 --> 01:27:18.514]  I'm good, how are you?
[01:27:18.914 --> 01:27:20.215]  Can I get a picture with you?
[01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.016]  Yeah, of course.
[01:27:21.256 --> 01:27:21.636]  I love this.
[01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:23.578]  How the police should be.
[01:27:59.455 --> 01:28:00.776]  They want your soul.
[01:28:00.956 --> 01:28:02.256]  We want your soul.
[01:28:03.136 --> 01:28:08.397]  We want you to not interface with God, but to stare down into the mud of the globalist system.
[01:28:11.218 --> 01:28:13.558]  So if you understand this, you understand everything.
[01:28:13.598 --> 01:28:15.939]  This is the real knowledge, and it's hiding in plain view.
[01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:22.920]  They want you to go against your common sense, go against your own senses, go against your own inner sixth sense that God gave you.
[01:28:24.192 --> 01:28:25.233]  They want full control.
[01:28:26.894 --> 01:28:29.237]  And so, your senses say pedophilia is evil.
[01:28:29.797 --> 01:28:31.599]  Your senses say incest is evil.
[01:28:32.119 --> 01:28:34.081]  Your senses say GMO is toxic.
[01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:41.007]  Your senses say I shouldn't trust a medical system with a long history of secret testing and poisoning people with these Trojan Horse vaccines.
[01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:44.771]  Your senses see people around you getting sick and dying from them.
[01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:52.998]  Your senses tell you when you see a cockroach, you recoil from it, even if you're a child, because cockroaches are dirty.
[01:28:53.038 --> 01:28:54.458]  They eat dead, rotten things.
[01:28:54.738 --> 01:28:56.238]  They carry poisonous bacteria.
[01:28:58.319 --> 01:29:00.780]  You see a strawberry, you want it.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.460]  You see a piece of steak, you want it.
[01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:07.641]  You see a loaf of bread, you want it.
[01:29:09.582 --> 01:29:15.263]  But you see a pile of feces, you don't want it.
[01:29:16.516 --> 01:29:19.638]  Because your brain already knows what you want.
[01:29:19.698 --> 01:29:26.622]  So when I mention this topic and I talk about this, you have to understand, I have studied every facet of what they're doing.
[01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:28.423]  So let's just go from the corporate model.
[01:29:28.623 --> 01:29:35.408]  Whenever they roll something out like eating bugs and making you eat bugs, they have to build it in where it makes money.
[01:29:36.448 --> 01:29:45.394]  So they say it's good for the earth, it's a new thing you need to do, eating meat is bad, you're going to get meat once a year, Bill Gates said so, and the meat you get is from him in a synthetic lab.
[01:29:48.055 --> 01:29:49.796]  Or it's gonna be made out of mealworms or beetles.
[01:29:51.097 --> 01:30:02.104]  And they're already rolling out new farming systems that are indoors that are bugs that they can raise for a lot cheaper and then turn into a protein and make you eat.
[01:30:02.344 --> 01:30:13.892]  And they can also feed them a lot of horrible toxic things like soybeans that will then pass on the toxic chemical in the soybean that will reduce your fertility and make you incredibly unhappy.
[01:30:16.092 --> 01:30:31.061]  So, big corporations have been launched, they're prepared, they're globally funded, all the red tape is cut back, and they're allowed to go, but they need somebody who's gonna eat it first.
[01:30:31.121 --> 01:30:41.768]  So now they're passing laws from Japan to Europe, soon here, California's set to do it, where you can't feed fish protein that comes from an animal.
[01:30:42.898 --> 01:30:48.680]  From chickens or from other fish or plankton, you've got to feed them plant products.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.341]  So you've already got, or insect products.
[01:30:52.901 --> 01:31:00.644]  So you've already got a built-in market to put in the insect farms everywhere to get it going for feeding fish farms.
[01:31:01.524 --> 01:31:06.866]  Then phase two is you start putting it into ingredients
[01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:12.725]  Like protein bars and protein shakes and then school lunch programs.
[01:31:13.305 --> 01:31:16.826]  And then extruded fake meat made out of insect protein.
[01:31:18.546 --> 01:31:22.647]  So that's why the Davos Group is, you will eat bugs, you will like it, you will drink sewage.
[01:31:22.947 --> 01:31:24.188]  You're like, oh, they're just saying that.
[01:31:24.228 --> 01:31:27.608]  No, they're not just saying that.
[01:31:29.049 --> 01:31:34.970]  And then companies that will push it, they'll be completely bankrolled because the mega banks control all the currency and everything else.
[01:31:36.516 --> 01:31:40.369]  And this is what they're teaching at the colleges for the future of agriculture!
[01:31:41.724 --> 01:31:46.327]  And horticulture and animal husbandry show that you don't have any choice.
[01:31:46.567 --> 01:32:01.578]  They are all trained for that new future, so they're going to go out with the code enforcers under Agenda 2030 and outlaw all of the other farming, saying, oh, cows have flatulence, methane's a poisonous gas, as if there weren't bovine all over the planet before, like the buffalo.
[01:32:02.118 --> 01:32:05.020]  They've made that a toxic waste, so you can't operate that way.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.182]  And if they took rid of the cattle industry, most of the people in the U.S.
[01:32:08.202 --> 01:32:10.064]  couldn't even pay the taxes on their farms.
[01:32:11.775 --> 01:32:13.495]  So it's economically shuts you down.
[01:32:13.575 --> 01:32:14.516]  It vertically integrates.
[01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:19.697]  Only mega corporations that can come out with these big warehouse internal bug farms can operate.
[01:32:20.857 --> 01:32:21.978]  It then displaces you.
[01:32:22.598 --> 01:32:27.219]  But it also just trains you that you're a commodity and that you don't get quality.
[01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:29.900]  Oh, hey, let's put maggots
[01:32:31.198 --> 01:32:48.164]  On your sandwich and then the left are into conformity and into ugliness and into doing what they're told and so they go out as virtue signal and show you how they're eating the bugs and show you how well in India they eat bugs.
[01:32:48.484 --> 01:32:49.805]  You need to learn to be like that.
[01:32:53.277 --> 01:32:54.840]  And oh, even grass-fed beef.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.701]  It's evil, too.
[01:32:56.062 --> 01:32:59.828]  Not just stuff raised indoor, which almost doesn't exist.
[01:33:00.269 --> 01:33:02.232]  Some places have a feedlot before they go to slaughter.
[01:33:02.513 --> 01:33:04.095]  They fatten them up a bit to get a higher dollar.
[01:33:04.396 --> 01:33:05.898]  So for like a week or two, they eat grain.
[01:33:08.308 --> 01:33:15.535]  So this is the demonization of everything, but don't worry, the Davos Group and the mega banks, they will tell you what you can eat, what you can do, and how you can operate.
[01:33:15.896 --> 01:33:18.658]  And then the protein quality of insects is much lower.
[01:33:19.179 --> 01:33:28.909]  There's a lot of toxins associated with them, a lot of health problems associated with them, a lot of parasites in them, a lot of allergic reactions to them, a lot of toxicity to it.
[01:33:30.219 --> 01:33:34.880]  And they could feed the insects what they want, and they won't bioaccumulate the toxins.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:39.442]  Insects almost pass 100% of what they eat on to you.
[01:33:40.562 --> 01:33:47.204]  And so they're perfect to feed the insects chemical and bioweapon type stuff to manipulate your genetics even more.
[01:33:47.464 --> 01:33:57.147]  That's what they really want about the bugs, is they can then, part of their neurochemo that we talked about yesterday, with these new
[01:33:58.638 --> 01:34:05.862]  Metallic injections you're given, the London Guardian reports, that then control your mind with electromagnetic systems and light.
[01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:09.484]  In fact, I've covered that on the war in your stand.
[01:34:09.504 --> 01:34:13.567]  I'd asked very politely, I know a lot's going on, to please have that put on my desk this morning.
[01:34:13.607 --> 01:34:22.272]  It was not my whole stack of research on the on the nano magneto injections, please.
[01:34:23.572 --> 01:34:27.235]  We had a big stack on that and that's key to understanding all this because they describe the
[01:34:31.502 --> 01:34:36.687]  Neuron chemo development and how they will feed insects the drugs and then we will eat the insects.
[01:34:37.447 --> 01:34:42.852]  So, and then the regulators are set where they don't count an insect as a drug even though it's fed the drug.
[01:34:43.132 --> 01:34:43.913]  You understand how this works?
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:52.280]  And so, that's how they're going to be able to feed all of you this and then if they test it, they go, oh, that was just in the insect.
[01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:57.524]  The food that can feed and maybe save the planet, bugs!
[01:34:57.564 --> 01:35:04.129]  That's right, you're gonna drink sewage, Bill Gates said, you're gonna eat bugs, Bill Gates said, Klaus Schwab said, and it goes on and on and on from there.
[01:35:05.650 --> 01:35:11.315]  So let's go ahead and roll this clip from CNN with them eating the bugs.
[01:35:13.148 --> 01:35:20.093]  Across the country, billions, trillions of cicadas are making their appearance after spending the last 17 years underground.
[01:35:20.213 --> 01:35:27.759]  And no one is more excited to see these winged insects make their debut than my next guest, who cannot wait to put them on his menu.
[01:35:27.859 --> 01:35:28.459]  That is right.
[01:35:28.539 --> 01:35:29.960]  Joining me now is Bun Lai.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.263]  He is a recipient of the White House Champion of Change Award.
[01:35:33.643 --> 01:35:38.427]  He is also the chef of Mia's, which is the first sustainable sushi restaurant in the world.
[01:35:38.707 --> 01:35:39.928]  Bun, thank you for being with us.
[01:35:40.128 --> 01:35:44.391]  Well, thank you for skipping breakfast and getting ready for this experience.
[01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:45.131]  I am ready.
[01:35:46.232 --> 01:35:47.873]  Well, no, I'm not really ready, I have to be honest.
[01:35:47.973 --> 01:35:51.835]  Okay, this is sort of... I haven't actually eaten a bug since I was three when I had a spider.
[01:35:52.155 --> 01:35:52.415]  Okay.
[01:35:52.535 --> 01:36:01.681]  Well, first of all, I'm really psyched about the whole trillions of cicada coming out for Brood X because it's getting so much press, and nature's getting press, so there's all sorts of...
[01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:10.705]  Important issues that this becomes a platform for so eating insects is really the future and it's been the past of Humanity as well.
[01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:11.065]  All right.
[01:36:11.105 --> 01:36:13.486]  So let's talk about what we're gonna do here today.
[01:36:13.886 --> 01:36:18.928]  You walk me through this fun Sure, so we got some insects right here some cicadas.
[01:36:19.029 --> 01:36:26.552]  Okay, basically everyone you want to eat when we come back I'm gonna get to the rest of this and then we'll go to your calls, but this is really important
[01:36:27.671 --> 01:36:29.192]  Because he's saying what your future is.
[01:36:29.973 --> 01:36:31.534]  Your future is no nuclear families.
[01:36:31.574 --> 01:36:32.935]  Your future is sterilized males.
[01:36:33.376 --> 01:36:34.596]  Your future is eating bugs.
[01:36:34.617 --> 01:36:37.259]  Well, who is it that always tells me what the future is?
[01:36:37.279 --> 01:36:38.239]  Well, that's your dictator.
[01:36:39.741 --> 01:36:41.842]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:36:41.902 --> 01:36:43.323]  The dystopia they're building.
[01:36:43.604 --> 01:36:45.245]  They can get you to take a deadly vaccine.
[01:36:45.265 --> 01:36:46.126]  That's not even a vaccine.
[01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:47.747]  They can get you to eat bugs.
[01:36:47.967 --> 01:36:48.688]  You're in a cult.
[01:36:49.048 --> 01:36:49.769]  You're in a cult.
[01:36:50.089 --> 01:36:50.749]  You're in a cult.
[01:36:50.769 --> 01:36:51.330]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.382]  One last breath before wind blows.
[01:36:56.163 --> 01:36:59.406]  Better raise your ears for the sound of hooves.
[01:37:14.518 --> 01:37:16.240]  Better raise your ears.
[01:37:19.302 --> 01:37:21.124]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[01:37:22.537 --> 01:37:24.298]  It's time to wheel the blade.
[01:37:24.318 --> 01:37:27.059]  Cause now you've got some company!
[01:37:27.079 --> 01:37:28.199]  Ha ha ha!
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:32.121]  Let us tease a ride!
[01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:34.982]  They come to take your life!
[01:37:36.783 --> 01:37:37.463]  Bill Gates.
[01:37:40.905 --> 01:37:44.086]  And Bill Gates knows he's been dying since the day he was born.
[01:37:44.846 --> 01:37:46.387]  He needs no confessors now.
[01:37:48.008 --> 01:37:48.588]  Oh yeah!
[01:37:52.915 --> 01:37:55.197]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:37:55.217 --> 01:37:58.899]  And I will do it here in just a moment.
[01:37:59.479 --> 01:38:02.081]  But let me just finish up with where I was going with this.
[01:38:03.842 --> 01:38:21.995]  We have a Chinese man, very nice man, telling us the future is eating bugs, just like we're told Xi Jinping is the future, and one-child policies are the future, and global social credit scores are the future, and Chinese response to the Wuhan release is the future, and
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:30.966]  She's there learning, and then she eats the bug, because she's a paid political whore on CNN.
[01:38:31.106 --> 01:38:32.627]  And it's delicious.
[01:38:32.987 --> 01:38:33.828]  It's wonderful.
[01:38:34.588 --> 01:38:35.449]  She enjoys it.
[01:38:35.529 --> 01:38:37.090]  And we're all learning.
[01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:41.053]  And now they have FDA announcements.
[01:38:41.253 --> 01:38:47.838]  Oh, hey, if you have shellfish allergies, look out with cicadas because you might get sick as well.
[01:38:48.519 --> 01:38:52.162]  Oh, it's even advisories, like we're all going to be eating it now because, oh, look,
[01:38:54.005 --> 01:38:54.525]  Oh, look!
[01:38:54.846 --> 01:38:57.047]  Hank Aaron took the experimental shot!
[01:38:58.869 --> 01:38:59.989]  I'm gonna get it right now!
[01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.450]  Oh, look!
[01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:01.731]  Marvis Marvin Agler took it!
[01:39:02.071 --> 01:39:02.511]  Oh, look!
[01:39:02.571 --> 01:39:03.432]  Ben Stein took it!
[01:39:03.512 --> 01:39:04.713]  Oh, they're dead and dying!
[01:39:05.933 --> 01:39:06.454]  Oh, look!
[01:39:08.255 --> 01:39:14.039]  CNN said, you know, cause the UN says you're gonna eat bugs, and a year later, you're gonna eat bugs!
[01:39:16.661 --> 01:39:19.983]  And you're not gonna eat meat, and you're not gonna be able to travel, and you're not essential.
[01:39:20.224 --> 01:39:21.244]  Oh, I'm not essential!
[01:39:21.424 --> 01:39:21.965]  I love it!
[01:39:22.145 --> 01:39:23.386]  Let me make a soy boy face!
[01:39:28.427 --> 01:39:31.288]  But now they're like, well, we need to actually eat human flesh, they're saying.
[01:39:31.348 --> 01:39:33.228]  That's now what the same group's coming out with.
[01:39:33.248 --> 01:39:44.671]  I mean, Daniel Boe's group said five years ago, we need to not allow traditional burials or cremations and that we should be made to grind up the bodies at a local facility to put it on the crops, to recycle it and eat the flesh, basically.
[01:39:45.071 --> 01:39:45.571]  Soil it green.
[01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:48.152]  And now 20 states have passed laws.
[01:39:48.552 --> 01:39:49.712]  A year ago, it was two states.
[01:39:49.792 --> 01:39:51.793]  Now it's 20 states have passed laws.
[01:39:53.868 --> 01:39:54.889]  To compost humans.
[01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:57.290]  Oh!
[01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:02.152]  And if you were hiding under a rock the last week, or like Rip Van Winkle maybe went to sleep?
[01:40:02.612 --> 01:40:03.013]  Woke up?
[01:40:05.094 --> 01:40:09.236]  Last Tuesday the Senate legalized human-animal cloning!
[01:40:10.973 --> 01:40:13.515]  And the smarter people out there are going, well, even the Senate legalized it.
[01:40:13.535 --> 01:40:14.076]  They didn't pass it.
[01:40:14.336 --> 01:40:15.417]  Oh, no, it was already going on.
[01:40:15.437 --> 01:40:16.097]  There was no law.
[01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:25.365]  See, it's kind of like when they come up with a synthetic heroin for a while, and then there's no law, and the DEA can't bust you because it's synthetic.
[01:40:25.385 --> 01:40:26.366]  Then they pass a law for that.
[01:40:26.986 --> 01:40:28.467]  Or a synthetic ecstasy or whatever.
[01:40:29.047 --> 01:40:31.748]  Well, you know, they've been human-animal cloning forever!
[01:40:31.908 --> 01:40:35.330]  Because there was a law against human cloning, not against human-animal cloning!
[01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:40.732]  Like I told you 25 years ago, they were doing it, they would just add some animal to it and say it had no rights!
[01:40:43.193 --> 01:40:47.835]  And then they had a bill to outlaw that, and it went down in flames!
[01:40:47.855 --> 01:40:51.996]  10... no, no, I'm sorry, 11 votes short.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.323]  To even pass a law out of the Senate into the House and maybe have Biden sign it.
[01:40:59.543 --> 01:41:01.404]  But Biden said, you know what Psaki said?
[01:41:01.424 --> 01:41:04.805]  She said, oh no, we're against that bill.
[01:41:05.046 --> 01:41:06.526]  We believe in stem cells.
[01:41:06.826 --> 01:41:17.792]  So did you know that a human animal clone brought to term, raised and harvested for organs, though it can talk and say it's ABCs, it's called a stem cell.
[01:41:18.032 --> 01:41:18.553]  That's right.
[01:41:18.913 --> 01:41:20.594]  Under the definitions worldwide,
[01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:31.766]  A bipedal humanoid that's 99% human has zero rights.
[01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:36.408]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[01:41:37.668 --> 01:41:40.950]  Let that sink in to the old noggin!
[01:41:42.851 --> 01:41:45.152]  So you see, I've learned how they run all this stuff.
[01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:52.390]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:55.073 --> 01:41:57.054]  So, what are we going to do about all this?
[01:41:58.356 --> 01:42:08.205]  Because, you see, if we don't stand up for our unborn, if we don't stand up for our old folks, because that's all Bill Gates is training us and Fauci's training us, like, hey, come on, that old lady, we don't need to take care of her.
[01:42:08.425 --> 01:42:10.086]  We're going to get some money and we kill her.
[01:42:10.106 --> 01:42:11.087]  Remember what Bill Gates said?
[01:42:11.107 --> 01:42:13.069]  He said, if we don't take care of an old woman,
[01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:22.459]  We can hire 10 teachers, and the 10 teachers, well, they're represented by that union he was speaking to, and they got real excited.
[01:42:22.479 --> 01:42:24.961]  It was kind of sexy to talk about killing people.
[01:42:24.981 --> 01:42:37.928]  It was like a conquest they were involved in, and Bill Gates was so important, and they were all at that important talk with him, and oh, they were in control now, and you think those teachers that went along with that
[01:42:39.787 --> 01:42:41.569]  Bill Gates is talking about you, dumbass.
[01:42:41.609 --> 01:42:42.931]  You're obsolete.
[01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:43.551]  He tricked you.
[01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:46.475]  He always wanted to get rid of the teachers unions because they're bad, but he's worse.
[01:42:46.755 --> 01:42:48.637]  He's got computer learning coming that he programs.
[01:42:49.458 --> 01:42:54.524]  He tricked you to shut down and to not reopen so he could bust your unions, which is coming next.
[01:42:54.984 --> 01:42:58.728]  And you dumbasses walked right into it just like you always do.
[01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:04.994]  All you libtards with your two or three degrees that are worthless think you're so smart.
[01:43:05.274 --> 01:43:08.997]  Every statistic shows you're depressed, you're mentally ill, and you're alone.
[01:43:09.277 --> 01:43:10.798]  Got a big article out today!
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:17.764]  Alarming rate of mental health problems in white liberal women!
[01:43:18.264 --> 01:43:20.926]  Why, they're the craziest group out there!
[01:43:21.346 --> 01:43:22.487]  Did we need a study?
[01:43:24.489 --> 01:43:28.172]  Did we need a national poll to know that white women
[01:43:30.307 --> 01:43:31.607]  Are completely insane?
[01:43:33.067 --> 01:43:35.868]  Because they bought into the whole system.
[01:43:36.308 --> 01:43:52.291]  They bought into not having a man or having a cuck man and they bought into taking all the Prozac and all the Ritalin and they bought into the system and now they're 45 and they can't have a baby and they're all alone and all they got is a fake Facebook avatar that's run by a system designed to make them commit suicide.
[01:43:54.071 --> 01:43:58.792]  They're in love with an algorithm and they've got a soy boy
[01:44:01.769 --> 01:44:03.690]  Who just wants them to buy him dinner.
[01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:09.253]  And they've all got their little artist boyfriends.
[01:44:12.235 --> 01:44:15.536]  And then they go to their little corporate job, and they know it's totally empty, they know it's all fake.
[01:44:15.797 --> 01:44:18.538]  They know it's just a placeholder for the collapse of civilization.
[01:44:20.559 --> 01:44:25.762]  And they've all tried girlfriends, and they've tried polyamory, and they've tried it all, and just none of it's fulfilling for them.
[01:44:25.802 --> 01:44:29.364]  And they even tried Satanism, and it just didn't give them what they needed!
[01:44:31.249 --> 01:44:36.831]  And now they're so upset, so they embrace leftist propaganda and garbage even more!
[01:44:37.051 --> 01:44:38.851]  But that doesn't empower them!
[01:44:41.072 --> 01:44:41.952]  So what are they gonna do?
[01:44:43.713 --> 01:44:45.213]  But I didn't get to the rest of the story.
[01:44:45.594 --> 01:44:47.134]  Would you like to see or eat the bugs?
[01:44:47.194 --> 01:44:48.375]  I'm gonna go to break, come back with your calls.
[01:44:48.395 --> 01:44:49.395]  We'll play the bug-eating part.
[01:44:49.415 --> 01:44:51.335]  I promise I'll go to your calls for at least the next hour.
[01:44:51.355 --> 01:44:52.356]  We have a special guest in the studio.
[01:44:53.616 --> 01:44:55.057]  But I didn't get to the really big news.
[01:44:57.017 --> 01:44:58.978]  And that's really the problem with all of this, isn't it?
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.781]  If I don't build this up, no one's gonna care.
[01:45:04.981 --> 01:45:12.523]  I've got news here so incredible that I can't even know how to deal with it.
[01:45:14.923 --> 01:45:16.743]  So I'm not blaming you for not knowing how to deal with it.
[01:45:16.763 --> 01:45:17.424]  I don't know what to do.
[01:45:18.424 --> 01:45:19.624]  We're all in over our head.
[01:45:24.905 --> 01:45:25.885]  We're all in over our head.
[01:45:28.046 --> 01:45:29.086]  It's all above our pay grade.
[01:45:30.486 --> 01:45:38.329]  We're just right here on this planet, which is a country club in space, and the scientists have done it before, they're doing it again.
[01:45:38.349 --> 01:45:42.730]  All right, let me hit the really huge news, and I'm going to write your calls.
[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:50.613]  I appreciate Stephen, Kate, Nikki, Josh, James, Andy, Bob, Catherine, Joey, and David holding, and we will get to every single one of you.
[01:45:55.839 --> 01:46:00.741]  I'm going to do deep research, which I've already done, but I'm going to get it all back together again, and I'm going to get all the video clips together.
[01:46:00.761 --> 01:46:03.662]  I'm going to do massive research and preparation.
[01:46:03.702 --> 01:46:08.684]  I mean, probably three hours of it on top of what I've already done for Sunday's show.
[01:46:08.744 --> 01:46:09.725]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:46:13.646 --> 01:46:18.868]  The secret invasion, the silent invasion.
[01:46:23.084 --> 01:46:24.325]  Stealth attack.
[01:46:25.205 --> 01:46:26.486]  That's what the injections are.
[01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:28.027]  We have the whole history, the whole background.
[01:46:30.249 --> 01:46:35.372]  And I was sitting there last night doing research at like, I couldn't go to sleep, like 1 a.m.
[01:46:36.253 --> 01:46:44.518]  at my desktop, looking into the magnetic particles they're putting in the vaccines, now confirmed, and just like asking, my God, what else are we about to learn?
[01:46:44.538 --> 01:46:46.400]  I mean, this is just completely insane.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:49.782]  I already knew this was going to happen, but Lord, to see it unfold is insane.
[01:46:53.695 --> 01:47:03.239]  And then I meant to send it to Scott, the producer, but I sent it to Tucker Carlson instead because he was in the article.
[01:47:04.639 --> 01:47:05.980]  And I wasn't even looking for this.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:14.223]  I guess they've got a new comic coming out about the Skrulls from the Fantastic Four and their secret invasion buying off the leaders of Earth.
[01:47:15.163 --> 01:47:17.004]  And then there's a Tucker Carlson character in it.
[01:47:18.069 --> 01:47:25.339]  But I was literally sitting there scribbling about what I'm going to call this special show I do about the stealth invasions of the vaccines.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.866]  And I was like, secret invasion or the secret invaders or the secret takeover.
[01:47:29.886 --> 01:47:30.607]  And like an hour later.
[01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:39.486]  I'm just scrolling through stuff and there's a Tucker Carlson type character to be a new show about secret invasion.
[01:47:39.706 --> 01:47:40.607]  I forget the exact name.
[01:47:40.667 --> 01:47:42.168]  I've got it in my phone.
[01:47:42.688 --> 01:47:46.471]  It's just like serendipity, synchronicity.
[01:47:47.091 --> 01:47:49.873]  Whatever the hell it is invading doesn't like us and wants to kill us.
[01:47:50.573 --> 01:47:57.558]  I don't know if it's Super Scroll or the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus, but all I know is, man, we ain't in Kansas and we've never been in Kansas.
[01:47:57.898 --> 01:48:00.260]  We're on a planet in space and there's some stuff going on.
[01:48:01.328 --> 01:48:10.073]  And the people running things are out to get us, and dumb us down, and poison us and control us, like they're intergalactic exterminators or something, and we are cockroaches.
[01:48:12.214 --> 01:48:17.336]  And let me tell you, you can be white, you can be black, the Bill Gates's of the world think you're a cockroach.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.661]  See, there's nothing more I hate though.
[01:48:26.937 --> 01:48:28.158]  Because I'm teleprompter free.
[01:48:28.218 --> 01:48:28.959]  Oh, there it is.
[01:48:28.999 --> 01:48:29.560]  Boom, they found it.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.166]  Marvel casting Tucker Carlson-like news anchor for Disney's Secret Invasion series.
[01:48:38.389 --> 01:48:40.591]  So I'm sitting there at like 1 a.m.
[01:48:41.012 --> 01:48:43.634]  trying to think of what I'm going to call this Sunday special show.
[01:48:44.724 --> 01:48:49.086]  To try to get people's attention about what they're, they're invading us through these vaccines or raping us.
[01:48:49.507 --> 01:48:53.869]  So I had stuff written down like, you know, big pharma's rape.
[01:48:53.889 --> 01:48:59.032]  No, I mean, because so much of this is a headline because I can sit here and lay all this incredible information out.
[01:48:59.672 --> 01:49:13.680]  But if, if I don't give it the right headline to really capture how crazy it is, no one cares because this is a, I mean, imagine if aliens were in control and they were putting nano
[01:49:15.714 --> 01:49:16.395]  Particles.
[01:49:20.179 --> 01:49:21.640]  Hell, that was a 1980s movie.
[01:49:22.361 --> 01:49:28.908]  Pretty well done, actually, by Canon Films that put out all the Death Wish movies.
[01:49:29.228 --> 01:49:30.510]  They put out a lot of good B-movies.
[01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:32.472]  It was called Invaders from Mars.
[01:49:34.096 --> 01:49:37.858]  And they grab you and inject you with a nanoparticle that controls your brain.
[01:49:37.878 --> 01:49:40.240]  And you're like, okay, that's Invaders from Mars.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:50.867]  We're literally living in Invaders from Mars, but it's not Invaders from Mars, it's our own humans doing it to us, creating new life forms, which are alien.
[01:49:51.767 --> 01:49:56.410]  They're creating, with computers, whole new viruses that have never been on Earth before.
[01:49:56.730 --> 01:49:58.011]  Alien, that's what alien means.
[01:49:58.912 --> 01:50:02.034]  And they're putting it in us
[01:50:03.303 --> 01:50:14.033]  And we're just accepting it because some little dwarf dude, Fauci, is telling us to take the injection.
[01:50:15.975 --> 01:50:21.781]  So I re-watched Inventors from Mars, which is a remake of a 50's film, that's excellent as well.
[01:50:23.174 --> 01:50:26.116]  I mean, it's cheesy, it's a B-movie, but it's better than most stuff you watch today.
[01:50:26.836 --> 01:50:28.458]  The 1950 one is even better.
[01:50:28.978 --> 01:50:36.603]  But what I'm saying is, it literally parallels this, ladies and gentlemen, except it doesn't look like an alien, so we're not fighting it.
[01:50:36.623 --> 01:50:38.865]  So let me show you this, and then I'm gonna hit this Sunday.
[01:50:38.885 --> 01:50:52.934]  There'll probably be some huge war start or something big, then I won't, but barring any big giant emergency, Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I'm gonna spend two hours on patents and reports and scientists confirming the plan to put
[01:50:54.435 --> 01:51:08.767]  Magnetic crystals that grow in your body that can be remote controlled by light or high energy arrays.
[01:51:11.184 --> 01:51:23.214]  And in the patents, they say the issue is you've got to have something that penetrates deep into all the tissue to control it, and it describes something much more powerful than cell phones, which is 5G.
[01:51:26.517 --> 01:51:27.458]  You can't make this up.
[01:51:28.739 --> 01:51:38.568]  And they give you one injection, and it starts growing these proteins that are magnetic.
[01:51:40.652 --> 01:51:56.064]  And that's why even Italian scientists have now confirmed that it's real and at the injection sites that magnets are sticking because it is replicating and creating magnetic cones in your cells.
[01:51:56.364 --> 01:52:01.828]  They're literally, like in a science fiction movie, they inject you and you start turning into a silicon robot.
[01:52:04.791 --> 01:52:05.291]  There it is!
[01:52:05.691 --> 01:52:08.433]  Engineering protein crystals make cells magnetic!
[01:52:09.514 --> 01:52:10.095]  Chemistry!
[01:52:11.513 --> 01:52:12.113]  For life!
[01:52:12.474 --> 01:52:15.516]  I mean, it turns out they're totally obsessed with it!
[01:52:15.696 --> 01:52:19.458]  It's a giant Manhattan project on steroids and PCP.
[01:52:19.498 --> 01:52:25.362]  Well, The New York Times, Jones claims they're taking PCP while they make this.
[01:52:25.622 --> 01:52:26.563]  It's a figure of speech.
[01:52:28.184 --> 01:52:29.925]  And suddenly it's just everywhere.
[01:52:32.918 --> 01:52:35.859]  I mean, this is sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.280]  So God knows what they're doing it for.
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.241]  God knows why there's jellyfish genes in there.
[01:52:40.621 --> 01:52:46.464]  But imagine if aliens said... Aliens land, they've got a communication device so they can talk to us.
[01:52:46.484 --> 01:52:49.965]  They go, People of Earth, we are here to bring you peace.
[01:52:50.465 --> 01:52:54.127]  You will have nothing, you will own nothing, and you will like it.
[01:52:54.387 --> 01:52:55.608]  You will eat bugs.
[01:52:56.108 --> 01:52:58.209]  Your boys will have their genitals removed.
[01:52:59.415 --> 01:53:03.416]  All we need to do is inject you with something and you'll get free beer.
[01:53:03.996 --> 01:53:08.397]  We'll allow you to travel and leave your rat holes, I mean your homes.
[01:53:09.357 --> 01:53:10.678]  We are here to free you.
[01:53:10.878 --> 01:53:12.298]  Just take the shot.
[01:53:12.398 --> 01:53:18.640]  It has jellyfish genes and grows magnetic prions like mad cow in you.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:20.540]  We are here to help you.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.841]  Never mind that Klaus Schwab looks like Dr. Evil.
[01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:27.142]  Bill Gates is your doctor and so is Fauci.
[01:53:27.782 --> 01:53:31.004]  Virus-sized transistors will now be put in your body!
[01:53:31.424 --> 01:53:33.045]  Please submit to us now!
[01:53:33.445 --> 01:53:34.746]  Everything's okay!
[01:53:35.026 --> 01:53:35.687]  We love you!
[01:53:35.707 --> 01:53:41.470]  Well, at that point in the movie, you know, the army tanks and helicopters attack and we kill the Martians.
[01:53:43.011 --> 01:53:45.473]  But, the Martian instead is Anthony Fauci.
[01:53:45.713 --> 01:53:46.794]  Maybe he is a Martian!
[01:53:47.094 --> 01:53:48.455]  With frickin' plastic skinners!
[01:53:49.215 --> 01:53:50.676]  I bet it's all true, probably!
[01:53:52.352 --> 01:53:53.853]  Maybe Bill Gates is a frickin' Martian.
[01:53:54.133 --> 01:53:57.596]  I don't know, man, but they're out to kill us, and Bill Gates says he wants to kill us!
[01:54:00.879 --> 01:54:02.200]  Your calls, I promise, are straight ahead.
[01:54:03.695 --> 01:54:10.118]  Remember, I told you years ago, they will sue me on the news saying, I love bugs!
[01:54:10.758 --> 01:54:12.019]  They're so tasty!
[01:54:12.319 --> 01:54:16.601]  They love seeing you wear a mask over your face, your child sitting on a pedophile's knee.
[01:54:17.021 --> 01:54:18.482]  They love seeing you eat bugs.
[01:54:18.502 --> 01:54:19.863]  They love seeing you dehumanize.
[01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:21.324]  They love seeing your lights out.
[01:54:21.344 --> 01:54:22.524]  They love seeing you starve to death.
[01:54:22.744 --> 01:54:26.426]  They love hurting you because they're empty and they want to take you with them.
[01:54:26.706 --> 01:54:28.107]  Here's CNN and I'll go to your calls.
[01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.541]  Name anything that you're gonna be eating.
[01:54:32.862 --> 01:54:33.903]  I'll name one Berman.
[01:54:35.784 --> 01:54:36.985]  Okay, so this is what?
[01:54:37.025 --> 01:54:37.965]  This is my seaweed?
[01:54:38.326 --> 01:54:40.687]  Yeah, so we're gonna roll it just this way, alright?
[01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:42.048]  So we're gonna put on some gloves over here.
[01:54:42.068 --> 01:54:42.728]  Alright, perfect.
[01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.249]  Cool.
[01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:44.009]  Got it.
[01:54:44.169 --> 01:54:45.470]  Berman, what do you think about this?
[01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:49.433]  I think my favorite Whitney Houston lyric is, I believe eating insects is the future.
[01:54:49.453 --> 01:54:52.015]  I mean, I love that song.
[01:54:52.195 --> 01:54:57.478]  No, look, I have intellectual and culinary curiosity about this, but I'm really just here to watch you eat bugs.
[01:54:58.959 --> 01:54:59.820]  Spread it right out.
[01:55:02.008 --> 01:55:04.290]  Bun, my husband is, like, not gonna kiss me for a week.
[01:55:05.871 --> 01:55:09.493]  So, seaweed with soy, so you're sterilized.
[01:55:09.993 --> 01:55:11.234]  Great, I'll let him do it.
[01:55:11.294 --> 01:55:13.276]  He doesn't mind cicada breath.
[01:55:13.376 --> 01:55:15.057]  It's like, what do you get the idiots to do?
[01:55:15.277 --> 01:55:16.118]  They're alive!
[01:55:16.298 --> 01:55:17.138]  Yeah, so there you go.
[01:55:17.158 --> 01:55:18.559]  Oh, I don't understand.
[01:55:18.579 --> 01:55:27.685]  So, the way you'll be doing it is, um... Oh, no, no, I was gonna have you just use those.
[01:55:28.246 --> 01:55:28.486]  No.
[01:55:29.006 --> 01:55:29.987]  The really fresh ones.
[01:55:30.207 --> 01:55:30.848]  Are you serious?
[01:55:30.868 --> 01:55:31.088]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:31.929 --> 01:55:32.149]  Yeah.
[01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:33.830]  So, there you go.
[01:55:34.771 --> 01:55:36.612]  I'm totally... See, it's all a big joke, everybody.
[01:55:37.392 --> 01:55:38.573]  Wait, no, really?
[01:55:38.613 --> 01:55:39.874]  Do I really have to eat a live one?
[01:55:39.894 --> 01:55:40.134]  No, no.
[01:55:40.594 --> 01:55:41.655]  Okay, I thought... I was kidding.
[01:55:41.675 --> 01:55:43.196]  I actually thought... Fred is spared!
[01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:44.977]  Fred survives another day!
[01:55:45.037 --> 01:55:45.277]  Woo!
[01:55:45.317 --> 01:55:45.818]  Berman!
[01:55:45.878 --> 01:55:47.379]  Berman, the cicada's alive!
[01:55:47.419 --> 01:55:49.080]  Yeah, so here are boiled cicadas.
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:50.240]  He had me going, Berman.
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:50.841]  He had me going.
[01:55:50.941 --> 01:55:55.844]  A psychological warfare expert came up with... And I was like, okay, well, I didn't know that that was part of the assignment.
[01:55:55.864 --> 01:55:57.945]  Oh, you don't have to eat a live one, just a dead one.
[01:55:58.065 --> 01:56:00.747]  You're about to eat dead cicadas, so don't get too excited just yet.
[01:56:01.227 --> 01:56:07.613]  I gotta be honest, I think this was really good for him to tell me I was eating live ones because this is seeming like an upgrade.
[01:56:08.034 --> 01:56:10.717]  If you look out the top, this is what a cicada looks like.
[01:56:20.168 --> 01:56:21.809]  Live is really horrible, but dead's okay.
[01:56:21.849 --> 01:56:23.150]  It's all the same.
[01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:26.854]  Think of a psychological warfare op using psychology against you.
[01:56:26.874 --> 01:56:29.356]  The key to beating them is realizing their operation.
[01:56:29.376 --> 01:56:30.737]  Then you already know what they're gonna do before they do it.
[01:56:30.757 --> 01:56:32.518]  Because it's just the same attack.
[01:56:32.678 --> 01:56:33.879]  Lie, lie, demonize.
[01:56:34.139 --> 01:56:34.780]  Use psychology.
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:35.521]  Attack the enemy.
[01:56:35.561 --> 01:56:36.161]  Attack the enemy.
[01:56:36.401 --> 01:56:37.182]  Teach them to eat bugs.
[01:56:37.202 --> 01:56:37.983]  Teach them pedophilia.
[01:56:38.223 --> 01:56:39.524]  Teach them to shut their son's balls off.
[01:56:39.564 --> 01:56:40.945]  Attack, attack, attack, attack.
[01:56:41.145 --> 01:56:44.028]  It's just... Think of zombies attacking you.
[01:56:44.775 --> 01:56:49.221]  Like in World War Z where the doctor's a zombie and he's hit the glass attacking us.
[01:56:49.942 --> 01:56:51.604]  You don't need to project intelligence on them.
[01:56:51.644 --> 01:56:52.325]  They just follow.
[01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:52.786]  Attack!
[01:56:52.866 --> 01:56:53.207]  Attack!
[01:56:53.547 --> 01:56:53.928]  Attack!
[01:56:54.008 --> 01:56:54.368]  Attack!
[01:56:54.428 --> 01:56:54.729]  Attack!
[01:56:56.331 --> 01:57:00.855]  And yeah, there they are in the last Blade Runner, where he's harvesting bugs for you to eat.
[01:57:01.216 --> 01:57:02.397]  It's in every movie, it's everywhere.
[01:57:02.657 --> 01:57:03.778]  A dystopia is coming.
[01:57:04.299 --> 01:57:05.700]  We're going to suck the earth dry.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:06.881]  All animals are going to die.
[01:57:07.041 --> 01:57:08.423]  Because they're going to kill the earth.
[01:57:08.743 --> 01:57:09.824]  They want to kill the earth.
[01:57:10.104 --> 01:57:13.207]  They want to kill all animals, all plants, all insects.
[01:57:13.508 --> 01:57:19.353]  They're the ones killing it, posing as the Guardian, telling you, eat the insects to save the earth, it'll really kill the earth.
[01:57:19.834 --> 01:57:20.815]  I promise I'm going to your calls.
[01:57:22.285 --> 01:57:28.829]  But let's finish up with the grand finale of, oh, I don't need to have to eat dead ones, or live ones, I need to eat dead ones.
[01:57:28.869 --> 01:57:29.209]  Here it is.
[01:57:29.690 --> 01:57:31.411]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:57:31.451 --> 01:57:33.152]  You got artwork over here as well.
[01:57:34.953 --> 01:57:35.353]  Are you ready?
[01:57:35.513 --> 01:57:35.793]  Cheers.
[01:57:35.933 --> 01:57:37.254]  Actually, I'm less scared of this.
[01:57:37.855 --> 01:57:38.115]  Okay.
[01:57:39.916 --> 01:57:40.856]  Oh, the crunch!
[01:57:42.517 --> 01:57:44.038]  Do I have a wing hanging out of my mouth?
[01:57:45.079 --> 01:57:46.320]  It's literally in there.
[01:57:47.261 --> 01:57:48.764]  It's not a wing, it's a leg.
[01:57:49.225 --> 01:57:52.312]  Hey, that's actually quite delicious!
[01:57:53.254 --> 01:57:54.116]  What does it remind you of?
[01:57:54.136 --> 01:57:57.062]  Reminds her of eating feces.
[01:57:58.626 --> 01:57:59.146]  With the Pope.
[01:58:00.166 --> 01:58:00.847]  Who's not the Pope.
[01:58:00.867 --> 01:58:06.668]  Remember he said all of us that don't agree with world government are like eating feces, so it's okay to turn that around against him.
[01:58:07.168 --> 01:58:09.569]  He's not a Catholic, by the way, folks, so I'm not attacking Catholics.
[01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:12.090]  Let's go to Steven in Georgia.
[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:13.310]  Line of the Sand.
[01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:15.031]  COVID vaccine on kids.
[01:58:15.131 --> 01:58:15.591]  I agree.
[01:58:15.991 --> 01:58:17.331]  That's my line of the sand, brother.
[01:58:17.351 --> 01:58:17.771]  Go ahead.
[01:58:18.912 --> 01:58:20.132]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:58:20.212 --> 01:58:25.253]  So, I mean, parents and people in general have a natural instinct.
[01:58:25.693 --> 01:58:27.514]  We want to take care of the children, which is the
[01:58:28.191 --> 01:58:32.714]  Which is the future of humanity, whether you're a parent or you're just a good person.
[01:58:33.534 --> 01:58:41.039]  But the problem is, most of these kids probably already had COVID, and we know that if they get the shot, it's going to be some adverse reactions.
[01:58:41.359 --> 01:58:47.663]  Nothing's better than a natural immunity, you know, because we need to take care of them.
[01:58:48.203 --> 01:58:52.386]  And that's, you know, the parents, you know, it's like, oh,
[01:58:53.596 --> 01:58:55.397]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, Steven.
[01:58:55.437 --> 01:58:55.817]  Great point.
[01:58:55.857 --> 01:58:58.778]  Let's put that headline back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:58:58.818 --> 01:59:00.219]  I'll read it for radio listeners.
[01:59:00.299 --> 01:59:04.860]  But major publications say, that's NBC News, science proves kids are bad for Earth,
[01:59:23.386 --> 01:59:24.667]  The amazingness of that statement.
[01:59:25.247 --> 01:59:28.069]  Morality suggests we stop having them.
[01:59:29.369 --> 01:59:32.951]  We need to stop pretending kids don't have environmental and ethical consequences.
[01:59:33.412 --> 01:59:36.774]  Oh, so now they're being quite obvious why you're taking the vaccine.
[01:59:37.154 --> 01:59:38.635]  Quite obvious how they want to kill us.
[01:59:39.595 --> 01:59:41.676]  It's the earth and the globalists are the earth.
[01:59:41.816 --> 01:59:42.657]  They have value.
[01:59:42.757 --> 01:59:44.238]  You need to die.
[01:59:45.879 --> 01:59:49.361]  Business Insider, I want to have kids, but I worry about the impact on climate change.
[01:59:49.701 --> 01:59:51.562]  How can I move forward, kill free?
[01:59:52.915 --> 01:59:57.796]  Well, get on board with the globalists and kill a bunch of other people politically, and then you can have children.
[01:59:57.856 --> 02:00:01.637]  It's just, it's total suicide cult out in the open now.
[02:00:02.957 --> 02:00:04.998]  And then you wonder why they're putting poison in the vaccines.
[02:00:06.478 --> 02:00:07.978]  Because you're not essential, they are.
[02:00:08.999 --> 02:00:09.419]  All right!
[02:00:12.359 --> 02:00:14.220]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nikki in Ohio.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.320]  Nikki, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:00:16.633 --> 02:00:18.454]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:00:18.634 --> 02:00:23.078]  I am so excited to talk to you, but at the same time, this is terrifying.
[02:00:23.098 --> 02:00:26.640]  So, I've been listening to you last night.
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:36.387]  You and Rob Du were talking about the idea of the magnetism and the prions, which as a molecular geneticist, I'm going to tell you, prions are very real.
[02:00:36.867 --> 02:00:41.010]  And as soon as they started talking about mRNA, I went, what are they doing?
[02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:43.112]  This is just a recipe for disaster.
[02:00:45.069 --> 02:01:05.915]  You also had this French scientist from 26 years ago talking about how we were going to have vaccines that were going to allow people to be turned into zombies and be controlled with low energy or low frequency bandwidth and or waves.
[02:01:06.375 --> 02:01:11.717]  And I went, why did I just read that had that same phrase in it?
[02:01:12.337 --> 02:01:14.578]  And it was Amazon sidewalk.
[02:01:15.194 --> 02:01:20.315]  And this is being rolled out, and I'm going to tell you guys what it is, but this is being rolled out pretty secretively.
[02:01:21.216 --> 02:01:36.259]  If anyone who is listening, if you still have an Amazon device in your home, the dots, the echoes, the shows, the floodlights, all of them are going to be turned into a ginormous network mesh.
[02:01:37.179 --> 02:01:37.620]  Okay.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:38.700]  On June 8th.
[02:01:39.761 --> 02:01:47.005]  They're all going to be talking to each other over Bluetooth in the 900 megahertz spectrum and other frequencies.
[02:01:47.865 --> 02:01:58.311]  They're going to turn on this huge system where this innocuous device that seems to be in every home in the West is going to be broadcasting these frequencies.
[02:01:58.551 --> 02:01:59.571]  I'm glad you raised this.
[02:01:59.611 --> 02:02:02.052]  Yes, it's like a 5G network, but another system.
[02:02:02.713 --> 02:02:04.113]  And you brought it in as your assistant.
[02:02:04.154 --> 02:02:05.074]  It's already spying on you.
[02:02:05.414 --> 02:02:08.656]  Now it's part of a repeater system or an antenna farm worldwide.
[02:02:09.634 --> 02:02:10.394]  Exactly.
[02:02:10.515 --> 02:02:14.637]  And then it actually reads on their frequently asked questions about this.
[02:02:15.257 --> 02:02:20.179]  If I disable Amazon Sidewalk, will my sidewalk bridges still work?
[02:02:20.239 --> 02:02:23.261]  And those bridges are the dots, the echoes, the actual devices.
[02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:29.224]  And it says, yes, all of your sidewalk bridges will continue to have their original functionality.
[02:02:29.244 --> 02:02:29.944]  So think about that.
[02:02:30.104 --> 02:02:35.007]  You think that you bought this to serve you, but really you've just put an Amazon network in everywhere.
[02:02:35.934 --> 02:02:45.478]  Exactly, and us as the unvaccinated, if you're vaccinated, I'm sorry, you're going to potentially have this zombie thing take over you.
[02:02:45.938 --> 02:02:54.241]  But if those of us who are unvaccinated, your whole neighborhood could become this, not become, may become, it will on June 8th, this mess.
[02:02:54.261 --> 02:03:08.471]  By the way, it's funny you say that because in the London Guardian it says they want to inject this in you to control your mind with optogenetics and chemogenetics and they've done it on rats and primates and that they can actually control them like remote control with electromagnetic systems.
[02:03:08.831 --> 02:03:12.573]  So if you've been injected with this, it gets into your brain, they can actually control you with it.
[02:03:12.654 --> 02:03:13.254]  It's right here.
[02:03:13.654 --> 02:03:14.455]  They're bragging about it.
[02:03:15.171 --> 02:03:16.812]  You're right over the target, Alex.
[02:03:16.952 --> 02:03:23.535]  That's exactly as soon as that French scientist came on and being I'm only 30, right?
[02:03:23.595 --> 02:03:26.537]  So I when I was four years old, I wasn't going to be hearing him.
[02:03:26.557 --> 02:03:34.401]  But having you bring that in there and get that trigger of low frequency bandwidth, being able to turn people into zombies like Rwanda.
[02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:41.533]  I would, it triggered it of, oh my goodness, they're turning our neighborhoods, they're going to turn our neighbors against us.
[02:03:42.054 --> 02:03:57.484]  Potentially as these zombie hordes, like you've been talking about as well, where people aren't going to have food, people aren't going to have their livelihoods, and then they're going to have these devices taking over, and they can send any message they want through these bandwidths that they're putting out there.
[02:03:58.084 --> 02:04:03.866]  And remember the goal that came out from insiders at Facebook, make you depressed, make you alone, make you controlled.
[02:04:04.246 --> 02:04:06.607]  And the more you have devices, the more mentally ill you are.
[02:04:06.627 --> 02:04:08.928]  It's definitely all a beta test of this.
[02:04:08.968 --> 02:04:11.889]  5G, all of its behavioral, that's in the mainline science.
[02:04:12.889 --> 02:04:22.993]  And we now know that some of these vaccines, they're called vaccines, they're not, are growing electromagnetic prions, magnetic magnetoproteins in your body.
[02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:34.352]  Wow, it turns out one of the guys pushing these implantable transistors, microtransistors, injected via a vaccine from the Chinese Communist payroll.
[02:04:36.213 --> 02:04:47.336]  I've got some really interesting pieces of intel I'm going to get to after I take more of your calls, but the word is, everybody should test this out, if you've had one of the mRNA vaccines that's creating this magnetism
[02:04:48.991 --> 02:04:54.554]  If you get near a chip reader at a veterinarian, it's triggering the chip reader.
[02:04:57.015 --> 02:05:03.138]  So if people are in Austin that have had the mRNA shot, we're not judging, we understand people make mistakes, call us.
[02:05:04.078 --> 02:05:07.240]  We need to get a hold of a vet and test this out for ourselves.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:11.042]  And folks sending us these messages need to go get video of it.
[02:05:11.062 --> 02:05:12.162]  That is very, very important.
[02:05:14.263 --> 02:05:15.084]  That's what Bill Gates said.
[02:05:15.104 --> 02:05:15.644]  We want a bunch of
[02:05:16.966 --> 02:05:22.511]  Magnetic microchips that are truly micro inside the injection to read it from a distance.
[02:05:22.531 --> 02:05:23.832]  That's all the funding he's been doing.
[02:05:24.352 --> 02:05:26.094]  And now we know the magnets have been sticking.
[02:05:26.574 --> 02:05:28.456]  Italian scientists have confirmed it's going on.
[02:05:28.496 --> 02:05:36.083]  And then when we found all this research about genetically engineering magnetoprotein remotely controls brain and behavior, this is the big one.
[02:05:37.023 --> 02:05:39.165]  All right, we got so many calls to get to here.
[02:05:39.185 --> 02:05:40.106]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:05:40.546 --> 02:05:42.048]  That'd be James of the United Kingdom.
[02:05:42.088 --> 02:05:44.029]  James, thanks for holding while I've been babbling.
[02:05:44.049 --> 02:05:44.350]  Welcome.
[02:05:45.785 --> 02:05:46.185]  Wow.
[02:05:46.305 --> 02:05:47.046]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:47.126 --> 02:05:47.746]  How you doing, man?
[02:05:48.126 --> 02:05:48.486]  Good, sir.
[02:05:48.506 --> 02:05:49.086]  Thanks for holding.
[02:05:50.447 --> 02:05:52.468]  A long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:05:54.929 --> 02:05:56.570]  Mate, it's an honor, brother.
[02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:58.250]  It's an honor, too, brother.
[02:05:59.011 --> 02:06:00.411]  Dude, quick plug.
[02:06:00.711 --> 02:06:05.173]  War Room with Owen, American Journal with Harrison, absolutely smashes it.
[02:06:05.533 --> 02:06:14.217]  All the crew, just shout out, you know, their almond fish oil, knockout, all your products, like, really great.
[02:06:15.845 --> 02:06:17.772]  I know you're in a Blackpool mood right now.
[02:06:18.293 --> 02:06:19.518]  It seems like.
[02:06:20.953 --> 02:06:27.677]  You know, being awake kept me going, and I just want to say, I just want to give a little white pill to you, just from me to you.
[02:06:28.258 --> 02:06:30.559]  I've had a son recently.
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:36.523]  We gave birth to a son about a month ago, and, man, he's just an angel, man.
[02:06:36.903 --> 02:06:40.746]  And, you know, it just gives me hope to keep going, you know.
[02:06:41.286 --> 02:06:43.147]  God is working in mysterious ways.
[02:06:43.387 --> 02:06:45.849]  It's really beautiful and magic, absolutely.
[02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:50.052]  So did something chemical or spiritual happen when you had that first child?
[02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.112]  Yeah, it is, man.
[02:06:53.612 --> 02:06:55.955]  I've been on this awakening.
[02:06:56.235 --> 02:07:02.403]  I started off with Tinfoil Hat, with Sam Tripoli, your old friend.
[02:07:03.704 --> 02:07:06.127]  Things just keep going in a certain direction.
[02:07:06.628 --> 02:07:11.514]  I got into you guys, and Owen's just absolutely awesome.
[02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:13.110]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:07:33.232 --> 02:07:47.577]  I don't want to get into it, like where I work and what I do, but I see through the houses in the early mornings, TVs on, you know, and they're all watching this propaganda.
[02:07:48.438 --> 02:07:59.922]  And recently it came out that they were talking about, well, your old friend, Piers Morgan, you know, like you've had a bit of a run in with him.
[02:08:02.537 --> 02:08:08.782]  So, but he got, he got fired from there for, for like going against the woke brigade.
[02:08:09.443 --> 02:08:10.504]  So it's kind of crazy.
[02:08:10.564 --> 02:08:12.605]  But anyway, so he's not on there anymore.
[02:08:13.406 --> 02:08:19.411]  So, so they had this thing on the other day where they said that, um, well, I'll go just find it.
[02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:20.132]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:20.352 --> 02:08:22.734]  Unfriend the unvaccinated.
[02:08:24.115 --> 02:08:27.098]  So it was basically like they said, Oh,
[02:08:27.896 --> 02:08:32.161]  If you're vaccinated that's cool, but if you're not...
[02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:36.753]  Vaccinated, then you should unfriend them on certain social media.
[02:08:36.773 --> 02:08:41.415]  Yeah, we always hear the Scientologists are bad because they say don't be involved with people that aren't part of it.
[02:08:41.475 --> 02:08:42.556]  Okay, yeah, that's not good.
[02:08:43.056 --> 02:08:50.579]  Well, the government and the media is telling you don't be friends with people that haven't taken an experimental dangerous shot that violates the Nuremberg Code.
[02:08:50.899 --> 02:08:51.620]  Beautiful point.
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:52.540]  God bless you, James.
[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:54.101]  Wonderful to hear your testimony.
[02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:55.642]  Okay, get ready.
[02:08:55.762 --> 02:08:58.563]  Joey and Bob and
[02:09:01.368 --> 02:09:04.849]  Josh and Katie and everybody else, we're going to your calls.
[02:09:04.909 --> 02:09:05.789]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:09:06.509 --> 02:09:08.070]  In T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:09:08.090 --> 02:09:08.590]  Stay with us.
[02:09:09.810 --> 02:09:13.891]  All right, I'm taking your calls in the order that they were received.
[02:09:15.492 --> 02:09:17.332]  Let's go ahead and take the next caller.
[02:09:19.052 --> 02:09:20.833]  Let's talk to Josh in Ohio.
[02:09:20.893 --> 02:09:21.233]  Welcome.
[02:09:24.059 --> 02:09:25.900]  Howdy Alex.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.641]  So what I wanted to start off with.
[02:09:27.781 --> 02:09:30.043]  So our racial divide in the United States.
[02:09:30.443 --> 02:09:44.051]  They had to put the biggest racist piece of crap in office so that the people that are sheep, that are still sleeping, that aren't awake, would believe everything that our politically driven news media would spew to them so they could start the race war.
[02:09:44.071 --> 02:09:45.432]  That's my first point.
[02:09:45.813 --> 02:09:48.134]  My second point, Fauci in his email.
[02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:49.615]  It's funny that
[02:09:50.197 --> 02:09:54.059]  Our governor here in Ohio was found to be in his emails.
[02:09:54.239 --> 02:10:00.081]  Isn't it a little fishy that he didn't want to meet with Trump and had COVID when he was supposed to meet with him?
[02:10:00.581 --> 02:10:08.144]  It's just, it's getting to this limelight of when you talk about this now with people, people are starting to believe you.
[02:10:08.164 --> 02:10:12.346]  But like how, when all of us would say 16 months ago that this came from a lab and that
[02:10:13.666 --> 02:10:15.026]  This wasn't just something.
[02:10:15.286 --> 02:10:16.527]  This was something that was planned.
[02:10:16.567 --> 02:10:19.489]  We were all, oh no, no, that's not it.
[02:10:19.989 --> 02:10:21.570]  You guys are naysayers.
[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:23.631]  You're denying the science.
[02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:27.313]  It's all coming to light and the evil is going to get their way.
[02:10:28.773 --> 02:10:29.594]  Well, I know this.
[02:10:29.954 --> 02:10:35.037]  People better know that the globalists are going to keep launching attacks, keep locking down until they go to prison.
[02:10:35.757 --> 02:10:37.278]  Okay, they're not going to stop now.
[02:10:37.318 --> 02:10:38.318]  They've gone operational.
[02:10:38.358 --> 02:10:40.840]  So everybody better get, you can't just be on the sidelines anymore.
[02:10:41.896 --> 02:10:45.837]  And so we have to go to war with them politically, economically, culturally, spiritually.
[02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:48.038]  They attack us first and physically.
[02:10:48.518 --> 02:10:50.659]  And we just have to know we're now not in beta.
[02:10:50.999 --> 02:10:52.100]  We're in operational.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.881]  And Fauci is the globalist medical officer.
[02:10:54.921 --> 02:10:56.021]  He's the head eugenicist.
[02:10:56.461 --> 02:10:57.882]  He was around even before Bill Gates.
[02:10:57.962 --> 02:11:00.803]  Bill Gates is above him in the chain of command.
[02:11:00.983 --> 02:11:02.423]  But Fauci is in command.
[02:11:02.743 --> 02:11:03.984]  He's like an operations chief.
[02:11:05.244 --> 02:11:07.185]  And either he goes down or we go down.
[02:11:07.205 --> 02:11:07.885]  Does that make sense?
[02:11:09.625 --> 02:11:10.806]  It makes complete sense.
[02:11:11.576 --> 02:11:16.868]  What they're going to do is they're going to continue to manipulate people just like they're manipulating everybody to get the COVID shot.
[02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:28.795]  And we all need to stand together and take the light of God and stand for what we stand for because it's starting to really tear me apart inside and I could just, I get so mad!
[02:11:28.835 --> 02:11:42.518]  It's very hard to be living in a modern bioweapon attack with world government run by Satanist pedophiles all out in the open and Blue's Clues has like pedophile flags on it now and I've got all these articles just announcing hell on earth
[02:11:43.118 --> 02:11:45.220]  And there's mainline headlines everywhere.
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.281]  Children are bad.
[02:11:46.561 --> 02:11:47.362]  Humans are bad.
[02:11:47.442 --> 02:11:48.143]  Get rid of people.
[02:11:48.383 --> 02:11:49.924]  They're not mincing words.
[02:11:49.944 --> 02:11:52.907]  They're launching their full program, their full attack now.
[02:11:53.427 --> 02:11:55.309]  And it's so sad that it's not easy to beat it.
[02:11:55.529 --> 02:11:57.171]  We should all just reject this out of hand.
[02:11:57.711 --> 02:11:58.372]  But we're falling.
[02:11:58.392 --> 02:11:59.913]  We have to go through the fire first, Josh.
[02:12:00.294 --> 02:12:01.375]  Thanks for calling, brother.
[02:12:02.737 --> 02:12:05.638]  All right, up next here, we're going to the order they received.
[02:12:05.658 --> 02:12:07.899]  Let's go to a call in Canada.
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:13.002]  Let's talk to Bob in Canada, still under New World Order lockdown.
[02:12:13.042 --> 02:12:13.602]  Bob, welcome.
[02:12:15.823 --> 02:12:19.505]  Oh, I'm a New World Order ATLL.
[02:12:20.125 --> 02:12:25.148]  And it's tough up here in COVID land because everyone wants to get the shot.
[02:12:25.228 --> 02:12:26.928]  Everyone's pressuring everyone to get the shot.
[02:12:29.275 --> 02:12:33.256]  I know someone in a local car dealership who died a week after they gave him the shot.
[02:12:34.356 --> 02:12:36.956]  And they're saying, well, he was working in a car with most droppings.
[02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:38.397]  Uh, yeah.
[02:12:38.557 --> 02:12:39.537]  That's a hell of a coincidence.
[02:12:39.897 --> 02:12:44.718]  And it's all done psychologically to see, okay, they let us brain damage a third of their boys.
[02:12:45.118 --> 02:12:47.618]  Let's just hit everybody with a weapon and see if they go along with it.
[02:12:47.858 --> 02:12:49.979]  It's because imagine this is a test.
[02:12:50.619 --> 02:12:54.659]  Can you imagine if people go along with this, what the next attack is going to be like?
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.200]  Oh, don't get me started.
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:12:58.340]  Don't get me started, Alex.
[02:12:59.577 --> 02:13:01.078]  I was in the military for 21 years.
[02:13:01.599 --> 02:13:07.363]  A lot of my friends have died from methamphetamine poisoning that our government has pushed to us.
[02:13:08.724 --> 02:13:11.746]  And meanwhile, oh yeah, just get the vaccination.
[02:13:11.766 --> 02:13:12.487]  It's all that great.
[02:13:13.928 --> 02:13:16.890]  Here in Canada, a lot of us have split it off.
[02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:21.373]  We're splitting off into a different type of society.
[02:13:22.074 --> 02:13:23.355]  We're mostly online.
[02:13:23.415 --> 02:13:24.476]  It's called the Plaid Army.
[02:13:24.836 --> 02:13:25.757]  PlaidArmy.com.
[02:13:28.331 --> 02:13:33.455]  We have this kind of fictional country called Diagonal Lawn, right?
[02:13:33.575 --> 02:13:36.017]  Do me a favor, I can hear most of what you're saying, it's a little muddy.
[02:13:36.297 --> 02:13:37.238]  Talk right into your phone.
[02:13:38.499 --> 02:13:38.699]  Okay.
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.403]  We're going with this fictional country called Diagonal Lawn, right?
[02:13:44.784 --> 02:13:51.669]  If you go from the Yukon or Alaska, right down to Florida, it creates a huge diagonal swath.
[02:13:52.242 --> 02:13:54.083]  In front of the whole North American country.
[02:13:54.203 --> 02:13:57.205]  Sure, we can take the conservative, pro-human parts of Canada and the U.S.
[02:13:57.266 --> 02:13:58.046]  and make a new country.
[02:13:58.346 --> 02:13:59.687]  What's the name again so we can look it up?
[02:14:00.788 --> 02:14:01.629]  Diagonalon.
[02:14:03.230 --> 02:14:05.071]  And, uh... Yeah.
[02:14:05.191 --> 02:14:06.172]  Diagonalon?
[02:14:06.192 --> 02:14:07.513]  Yeah.
[02:14:07.913 --> 02:14:08.974]  It's part of Platt-Army.
[02:14:10.014 --> 02:14:11.535]  And, uh... Yeah.
[02:14:12.136 --> 02:14:16.539]  It's... We're all... Kind of cool laughing there.
[02:14:16.559 --> 02:14:18.020]  We're all kind of like, uh...
[02:14:19.059 --> 02:14:21.882]  Hey Alex, I wanted to tell you really quick, I love your fish oil.
[02:14:21.902 --> 02:14:23.323]  I love your fish oil, iodine, vitamins, all that.
[02:14:23.343 --> 02:14:24.965]  And your water filter, really good.
[02:14:24.985 --> 02:14:25.525]  A lot of people are
[02:14:43.507 --> 02:14:50.744]  Like I can understand why people are feeling really the despair and everything right now because I mean like you know
[02:14:51.656 --> 02:14:53.478]  They're killing us, like you said.
[02:14:54.038 --> 02:14:57.342]  Everybody's out for our throats, and I hate it.
[02:14:58.062 --> 02:15:00.945]  Well, that said, we're all going through an incredibly traumatic thing.
[02:15:01.566 --> 02:15:03.167]  Half the people are acting like nothing's happening.
[02:15:03.207 --> 02:15:05.710]  We're watching it happen, and this is very traumatic.
[02:15:05.770 --> 02:15:09.433]  So, I'm not up here all peaches and cream, and neither are you, but we got God, at least.
[02:15:09.453 --> 02:15:13.758]  But yeah, can you believe that we're in the New World Order depopulation?
[02:15:13.978 --> 02:15:14.959]  I mean, we're in it, brother.
[02:15:15.759 --> 02:15:16.600]  That's exactly right.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:17.602]  Christ is risen.
[02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:18.964]  He's risen from the dead.
[02:15:19.405 --> 02:15:23.511]  He will bestow life on all of us whenever judgment comes.
[02:15:23.591 --> 02:15:24.012]  Exactly.
[02:15:24.052 --> 02:15:25.755]  Don't fear He who can kill your body.
[02:15:25.795 --> 02:15:26.997]  Fear He who can kill the soul.
[02:15:27.057 --> 02:15:27.858]  Just be with Jesus.
[02:15:28.618 --> 02:15:29.798]  Do not despair.
[02:15:30.078 --> 02:15:31.719]  By all means, do not despair.
[02:15:31.759 --> 02:15:33.419]  There will be a victory in the end.
[02:15:34.079 --> 02:15:39.761]  But, uh, I... I just... Man, I wanted to say more, but, like... I'm gonna hold you as long as you need to, Brother Middleman.
[02:15:39.781 --> 02:15:40.061]  Listen to this.
[02:15:40.641 --> 02:15:42.541]  I've gone to some big churches lately that are reopened.
[02:15:42.561 --> 02:15:43.662]  They're not talking about this.
[02:15:43.942 --> 02:15:45.362]  The Bible's being fulfilled.
[02:15:45.462 --> 02:15:46.442]  World government's here.
[02:15:46.682 --> 02:15:48.783]  They're not saying a damn word because they're scared.
[02:15:50.083 --> 02:15:54.286]  I mean, this should be the biggest revival ever should be happening right now.
[02:15:54.426 --> 02:16:00.189]  World government, Mark of the Beast, cashless society, forced injections, attack on the family.
[02:16:00.449 --> 02:16:01.530]  It's all happening now.
[02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:02.430]  It's all fulfilled.
[02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:08.353]  I wouldn't disagree with you there, but I don't want to say one church...
[02:16:10.089 --> 02:16:14.492]  The Orthodox Church, you know, that's the church that I've come to a lot.
[02:16:15.973 --> 02:16:22.076]  I have seen Orthodox pastors or priests out of Europe really saying, world government, market to be Satan.
[02:16:22.516 --> 02:16:27.539]  I have seen some of the biggest truths out of the Orthodox Church and I'm not, I don't even try to look for it, I just see it all over.
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:30.081]  Looks like the leaders of Orthodox Church are pretty hardcore.
[02:16:30.782 --> 02:16:31.222]  For sure.
[02:16:31.282 --> 02:16:36.065]  And I love Jay Dyer, too, who you've had as a guest onto your show before.
[02:16:36.545 --> 02:16:38.526]  And I love him.
[02:16:38.586 --> 02:16:39.767]  He's an Orthodox Christian.
[02:16:40.027 --> 02:16:42.248]  So tell me, what's going on with the Orthodox priests?
[02:16:42.268 --> 02:16:43.409]  Because they seem to know what's going on.
[02:16:44.689 --> 02:16:47.951]  Well, it's the church that Jesus Christ started.
[02:16:48.671 --> 02:16:57.556]  It's not like some church where Father Bruce would have started inside of like a pedo Roman Catholic.
[02:16:58.248 --> 02:17:08.115]  branch or where some delusional guy who thinks he knows everything started his own cult inside of a swamp somewhere.
[02:17:10.776 --> 02:17:19.682]  We have the traditions, we have the oral teachings, we worship everything.
[02:17:20.223 --> 02:17:22.945]  Everything is centered around us especially as well.
[02:17:23.785 --> 02:17:24.706]  It's not like a
[02:17:25.936 --> 02:17:28.118]  We even have to prove anything.
[02:17:28.138 --> 02:17:32.862]  I feel like it's... Well, listen, I believe in Jesus, and Jesus said he judged the tree by its fruits.
[02:17:33.003 --> 02:17:40.670]  All I know is, I see the Orthodox Church all over saying, the mark of the beast is here, say no to the microchip, say no to the vaccine.
[02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:46.895]  And then I see the other religions, Christian faiths, saying take the injection.
[02:17:46.915 --> 02:17:50.439]  So, are there any Orthodox leaders, though, saying take the vaccine?
[02:17:52.074 --> 02:17:59.288]  My, my priest said, like, take it if, this is like really back early, he said to like take it
[02:17:59.967 --> 02:18:16.931]  If you wanted to, but he did say that, like, you know, like, okay, the virus exists and, you know, like, you know, this vaccine is here, vaccines work, but I'm not, he didn't, I'm sure he didn't know that this was, like, an mRNA vaccine that's designed to kill you and everything like that.
[02:18:17.451 --> 02:18:18.251]  I'm sure he didn't know.
[02:18:18.311 --> 02:18:20.932]  If he, if he would have known, he probably wouldn't have told anyone.
[02:18:20.972 --> 02:18:28.334]  A lot of churches are preaching it as God's healing power and the New Communion is taking the Chicom Gates devil injection
[02:18:29.174 --> 02:18:30.595]  And so it's just crazy.
[02:18:30.636 --> 02:18:31.596]  Joey, thank you so much.
[02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:32.417]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:18:33.838 --> 02:18:36.741]  Constitutional lawyer, big criminal lawyer, big first woman lawyer.
[02:18:37.543 --> 02:18:40.164]  Orm Patus was scheduled to come in the next two segments and he is.
[02:18:40.905 --> 02:18:47.128]  He's got some big breaking news that we'll break here in just a moment because he knows these guys and gets that stuff first.
[02:18:47.909 --> 02:18:49.249]  So look for that here in just a moment.
[02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:56.313]  And like I said, I'll be back tomorrow with my regular show and then I'm going to do a Saturday show that's three hours long that airs at 6 p.m.
[02:18:56.713 --> 02:18:57.574]  It'll be taped to air.
[02:18:58.114 --> 02:18:58.714]  This is live.
[02:18:58.774 --> 02:18:59.455]  It'll be taped to air.
[02:19:00.981 --> 02:19:02.202]  I don't know why that matters, I'm just telling you.
[02:19:02.222 --> 02:19:04.004]  It's like it's bad if it's not live, so I tell you.
[02:19:04.765 --> 02:19:06.847]  It's even better if it's not live, because I can add more stuff to it.
[02:19:07.368 --> 02:19:23.944]  And then Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I'll be live, and I'm going to hit the plan to not just put implantable microchips in the vaccines, but nanotech that grows that they can then mind control you with in their own admissions and patents and on and guarding.
[02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:35.317]  There's like hundreds of articles we've already found on this, and patents, and admissions, and Gates is involved, and it's just, they're assaulting us with it, and thinking it'll be such a crime they'll never get in trouble.
[02:19:35.817 --> 02:19:37.318]  Because, you know, who's gonna prosecute them?
[02:19:37.338 --> 02:19:40.920]  It's just, it's such a huge crime, how do judges even understand this?
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:42.481]  How does the FBI even understand this?
[02:19:42.721 --> 02:19:43.882]  How do I understand this?
[02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:50.506]  I mean, I study this all the time, and I'm just blown away by how fast they're moving, the Blitzkrieg attack, how insane it is.
[02:19:52.407 --> 02:19:53.448]  It's like in the
[02:19:55.083 --> 02:19:56.252]  The Body Snatchers, the 1950s one.
[02:19:58.183 --> 02:20:13.849]  Where the doctor finds out they're putting the pods next and absorbing the other person and killing them and that it's these mimics and he finally gets to the highway and there's a military truck and he jumps up and says, we're in danger, they're in danger and he sees the military truck has a bunch of pods in the back and they've been taken over.
[02:20:14.629 --> 02:20:20.271]  Then he runs to the next town and talks to the police chief and folks and they believe him and then they fight back but you don't know how it ended.
[02:20:20.551 --> 02:20:24.153]  I mean, this isn't aliens but the globalists might as well be aliens.
[02:20:24.193 --> 02:20:24.973]  I'm going to explain this again.
[02:20:26.271 --> 02:20:37.156]  When the Iron Horse came out west, and they started building the big railroads out of Omaha, Nebraska, a lot of those Native Americans had never seen white men before.
[02:20:38.377 --> 02:20:45.861]  And by the time they were seeing them, they were in giant iron horses that were as alien as a flying saucer from Mars landing.
[02:20:48.962 --> 02:20:49.283]  Okay?
[02:20:51.444 --> 02:20:53.345]  And so, that's how this operates.
[02:20:54.369 --> 02:21:04.855]  And so the globalists are hitting us with a societal, cultural, technological takeover that's so advanced that they just believe we'll be stunned by it and then it'll be over and they're going to win and take over.
[02:21:05.296 --> 02:21:17.503]  And then the world they're building, that advance is a post-human world where we merge with machines and Klaus Schwab says, we will change your very DNA, we will overwrite your body and make you merge with machines.
[02:21:17.543 --> 02:21:21.045]  Well, that's an injection that grows electromagnetic cones in your body.
[02:21:23.644 --> 02:21:26.845]  And telling boys they're really girls and GMO and all of this.
[02:21:27.185 --> 02:21:28.786]  And you realize this is their assault.
[02:21:28.806 --> 02:21:36.069]  I mean, when Hitler started invading Europe, it took him like a month to figure out it was happening.
[02:21:36.089 --> 02:21:37.330]  Like, why is he invading?
[02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:39.210]  He just attacked Czechoslovakia.
[02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:40.611]  He just attacked France.
[02:21:40.871 --> 02:21:44.893]  He just went into... It's like, you know, you gotta finally figure out you got hit.
[02:21:49.454 --> 02:21:50.695]  And we're being hit.
[02:21:53.789 --> 02:21:55.952]  And they even admit they're hitting us!
[02:22:00.618 --> 02:22:09.650]  And now, Italian scientists have confirmed the injection sites are magnetic, and then, oh my god, people type in, vaccines magnetic, and it's everything they're obsessed with!
[02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:10.692]  It's the attack!
[02:22:19.659 --> 02:22:22.461]  Alex, thank you for letting me on your show.
[02:22:22.481 --> 02:22:22.701]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:50.014 --> 02:22:57.184]  I just want to tell you, man, look into the camera, because from me to you, never give up, because I'm not giving up.
[02:22:57.204 --> 02:22:58.426]  I have been called.
[02:22:59.426 --> 02:23:04.329]  And I can't explain to you what has happened, but I'll just, to me, but I'll give you this information.
[02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:05.610]  There's a giant awakening.
[02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:11.254]  When humanity's under this level of attack, a sixth sense transmission goes out through all of us to do something and it activates you.
[02:23:11.294 --> 02:23:12.215]  The sleeper is awoken.
[02:23:12.435 --> 02:23:14.216]  Listen, I'm the opposite of giving up.
[02:23:14.276 --> 02:23:14.856]  It's not that.
[02:23:15.297 --> 02:23:16.978]  I physically want to go do stuff.
[02:23:16.998 --> 02:23:17.438]  You understand?
[02:23:17.959 --> 02:23:19.239]  With me, it's the opposite of giving up.
[02:23:19.259 --> 02:23:20.861]  I'm so pissed I can barely do a show.
[02:23:21.641 --> 02:23:30.508]  And I'm so pissed at all the white people and black people and everybody else fighting with each other over what color we are while the New World Order's taking over and killing us!
[02:23:32.169 --> 02:23:32.870]  Absolutely.
[02:23:33.310 --> 02:23:34.691]  And we can never back down.
[02:23:34.751 --> 02:23:35.572]  We are tired.
[02:23:35.872 --> 02:23:37.053]  We need to band together.
[02:23:37.453 --> 02:23:42.157]  And here, I will give you my information so we can get it out there.
[02:23:42.277 --> 02:23:44.919]  So, I found a Humanity 2.0.
[02:23:45.339 --> 02:23:48.662]  It's all over YouTube, all over Rumble.
[02:23:49.482 --> 02:24:02.967]  And what it is, it's a broad-spectrum gathering of luminaries and stakeholders at the Vatican to explore specific implements into the human flourishing and to discuss courses of action aimed at overcoming them.
[02:24:03.467 --> 02:24:09.889]  The Vatican, I will say it on TV, I grew up Catholic.
[02:24:10.569 --> 02:24:13.050]  My son goes to a private Catholic school.
[02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:18.512]  I've never, I've always had a confliction with religion all my life.
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:23.384]  I will take on the Vatican Church because this is pure evil.
[02:24:23.765 --> 02:24:29.812]  These people are, they're all combined together with Gates, with... Oh, exactly.
[02:24:29.832 --> 02:24:32.595]  We don't blame Catholics, we don't blame Muslims, any of this.
[02:24:33.316 --> 02:24:36.159]  It's evil's taking over all these major power organizations.
[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:38.682]  And it's making its move right now.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:40.320]  Right.
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:43.581]  And it's just upsetting to find out what's going on.
[02:24:44.241 --> 02:24:48.542]  But so, you know, we all need to chew some bubble gum and kick some ass.
[02:24:48.882 --> 02:24:49.502]  No, I agree.
[02:24:49.522 --> 02:24:54.143]  The Bible tells us they've made a deal with a fallen creature, not of this world, to enslave us.
[02:24:54.643 --> 02:24:58.124]  And God's going to come in if we do the right thing and stay faithful and kick their ass in the end.
[02:24:58.484 --> 02:25:00.544]  But we've got to be faithful to the end.
[02:25:00.564 --> 02:25:01.604]  God bless you, Andy.
[02:25:01.664 --> 02:25:02.065]  I love you.
[02:25:02.085 --> 02:25:02.525]  Call me back.
[02:25:02.925 --> 02:25:05.385]  I'm going to take even more calls tomorrow, probably the whole show.
[02:25:05.525 --> 02:25:08.406]  And then, like I said, I'm going to be broadcasting Saturday and Sunday.
[02:25:08.446 --> 02:25:09.066]  It's all coming up.
[02:25:09.426 --> 02:25:10.927]  I gotta get to as many people as possible here.
[02:25:12.187 --> 02:25:19.690]  Kate in New Jersey, go ahead.
[02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:28.673]  You mentioned the cloning of meat, and I have seen that there are celebrities that clone themselves and sell meat, so there is a company that does that.
[02:25:28.893 --> 02:25:32.154]  Yes, it's a form of cannibalism, it's all satanic rituals, yes.
[02:25:33.533 --> 02:25:37.235]  Yeah, so I called about this documentary that's on Amazon Prime.
[02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:39.176]  So it's called Confessions of a Man from 3036.
[02:25:39.657 --> 02:25:43.919]  He's a time traveler, apparently.
[02:25:44.459 --> 02:25:46.100]  So he was actually found murdered.
[02:25:46.621 --> 02:25:50.303]  They couldn't ID him because his DNA didn't resonate with anything.
[02:25:50.947 --> 02:25:51.387]  We're good to go.
[02:26:15.817 --> 02:26:17.518]  We, uh, he said that we are free.
[02:26:17.678 --> 02:26:20.339]  We are as free as you ever will be right now.
[02:26:20.359 --> 02:26:26.622]  Uh, in history, he learned, um, obviously this is the year 3036, that this is called the idiot era.
[02:26:26.642 --> 02:26:30.644]  So in the future, they, they refer to us as the idiot era.
[02:26:31.265 --> 02:26:32.505]  Um, there's no more parents.
[02:26:32.545 --> 02:26:36.227]  So that's actually, you know, what's going on with them trying to get mother, father away from those terms.
[02:26:36.828 --> 02:26:41.130]  Actually, I see robots, um, raise the baby, raise kids.
[02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:43.731]  So there's no such thing as like the parental relationship.
[02:26:44.338 --> 02:26:46.960]  Um, they live in pods and they can't breathe air.
[02:26:47.381 --> 02:26:48.322]  So he had a mask on.
[02:26:48.342 --> 02:26:51.044]  I don't remember if it was the time of COVID or if it was prior to COVID.
[02:26:51.064 --> 02:26:53.846]  Sure, that's as opposed to, you know, a mockumentary deal.
[02:26:54.087 --> 02:26:54.467]  I get it.
[02:26:54.827 --> 02:26:55.808]  That's the projection.
[02:26:55.848 --> 02:26:57.309]  It's Brave New World's their real plan.
[02:26:57.330 --> 02:26:58.410]  Thank you for the call.
[02:26:58.491 --> 02:26:58.771]  Okay.
[02:26:59.772 --> 02:27:01.073]  I want to get to all these other callers.
[02:27:01.093 --> 02:27:03.555]  Get their name and number and it's up to you, John.
[02:27:03.575 --> 02:27:04.155]  Don't let me forget.
[02:27:04.456 --> 02:27:05.637]  I will call them first.
[02:27:06.177 --> 02:27:07.679]  We'll take calls the first hour tomorrow.
[02:27:07.699 --> 02:27:08.940]  I'll go directly to all these callers.
[02:27:14.691 --> 02:27:30.098]  You say that you wanna go to a land that's far away How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today?
[02:29:15.751 --> 02:29:22.617]  All right, we have so much breaking news, a confluence of it, an alignment of it, right now.
[02:29:22.857 --> 02:29:27.420]  And I am going to be hosting part of the War Room today with Dr. Ruby, who's amazing.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:30.423]  She's got a bunch of medical doctors coming on to expose what's happening.
[02:29:32.224 --> 02:29:33.485]  You do not want to miss that information.
[02:29:33.525 --> 02:29:38.529]  But here's the huge news that just broke minutes ago at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:39.090 --> 02:29:39.970]  President Trump
[02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:47.065]  Has come out and attacked Fauci, and the Wuhan lab, at the gain of function, is finally separating himself from them.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:52.363]  When they misled him and controlled him the entire time.
[02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:59.810]  And I know Trump means well, but him signing on to the vaccine, him signing on to all of it has been his biggest defeat.
[02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:02.732]  But now he gets that Fauci is a Qaikom Globalist agent.
[02:30:03.232 --> 02:30:05.675]  Trump blasts Fauci for Wuhan gain-of-function research.
[02:30:05.695 --> 02:30:07.556]  Devastating emails in new statement.
[02:30:07.897 --> 02:30:11.600]  I will host the first few segments of The War Room today, 3 p.m.
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:12.501]  Central.
[02:30:12.921 --> 02:30:16.144]  That's in about 24 minutes from now on the Dr. Ruby.
[02:30:16.664 --> 02:30:20.525]  We'll take over, but I'll read his full statement and more on air, give you my analysis.
[02:30:20.565 --> 02:30:24.046]  Now, we had Norm Pattis, one of the top criminal lawyers in the country.
[02:30:24.066 --> 02:30:25.026]  He's definitely in the top three.
[02:30:26.087 --> 02:30:33.149]  And of course, good friends with F. Lee Bailey and Mr. Spence, who represents right now in a big trial, and so much more.
[02:30:33.729 --> 02:30:37.390]  And he's got some big breaking news on that front of F. Lee Bailey.
[02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:42.731]  So, Norm, you were going to hit other issues like the debate over repeal of Section 230.
[02:30:43.511 --> 02:30:45.312]  George Orwell, was he too optimistic?
[02:30:45.792 --> 02:30:48.775]  Declining world and the threat of globalism.
[02:30:48.896 --> 02:30:50.878]  Israel, there were two states in 48.
[02:30:51.458 --> 02:30:52.760]  Palestinians threw their way.
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:54.101]  Pandemic is over.
[02:30:54.161 --> 02:30:55.302]  Why do we keep talking about it?
[02:30:55.683 --> 02:30:58.586]  We're on whiteness, the sickening rhetoric of white supremacy.
[02:30:59.527 --> 02:31:03.932]  I wanted to hit that with you, but you're going to also be on with Dr. Ruby coming up later.
[02:31:03.972 --> 02:31:05.874]  But wow, F. Lee Bailey, tell us what happened there.
[02:31:06.581 --> 02:31:12.566]  Yeah, I was waiting in the room to come in here and I just got a call he died within the last half an hour or so.
[02:31:12.586 --> 02:31:13.707]  So that's breaking here?
[02:31:13.767 --> 02:31:14.548]  That's breaking here.
[02:31:14.688 --> 02:31:15.869]  Yeah, no, F. Lee Bailey was 88.
[02:31:15.929 --> 02:31:17.971]  And you know, he's 88.
[02:31:18.031 --> 02:31:19.132]  Nobody gets out of here alive.
[02:31:19.152 --> 02:31:21.914]  He was struggling, but he died in a hospital.
[02:31:21.974 --> 02:31:24.597]  He'd been recovering from a broken limb and never got better.
[02:31:25.197 --> 02:31:27.639]  But you know, it's a devastating loss to American law.
[02:31:27.719 --> 02:31:31.341]  I've known him for 20 years and been involved in many cases with him.
[02:31:32.402 --> 02:31:36.824]  He had, in my view, the sharpest legal mind I've ever seen.
[02:31:36.844 --> 02:31:43.148]  His ability to see patterns and facts that you otherwise missed was overwhelming.
[02:31:43.168 --> 02:31:43.949]  It was amazing.
[02:31:44.269 --> 02:31:52.699]  I would bring clients to him when he was living up in Maine to talk about complex issues in cases and he had a way of turning to me and he'd say, you know, have you thought about X?
[02:31:52.719 --> 02:31:53.741]  Have you thought about Y?
[02:31:54.101 --> 02:31:57.105]  As though it were an obvious conclusion and I'd missed it.
[02:31:57.966 --> 02:32:00.309]  You know, he recently wrote a book on the OJ trial.
[02:32:01.089 --> 02:32:02.150]  The truth about the O.J.
[02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:04.431]  Simpson trial, I've had a chance to review it.
[02:32:04.771 --> 02:32:06.112]  I'd urge your readers to read it.
[02:32:06.152 --> 02:32:10.354]  I realize the trial was long ago, but he makes a compelling case that O.J.
[02:32:10.414 --> 02:32:19.698]  was actually innocent, that there was a third party observed at the scene, and that for tactical reasons, Johnny Cochran never presented that evidence during trial.
[02:32:19.718 --> 02:32:20.298]  Because O.J.
[02:32:20.318 --> 02:32:21.119]  didn't want that out.
[02:32:21.823 --> 02:32:23.645]  Well, it was a little more complicated than that.
[02:32:23.665 --> 02:32:25.787]  The trial went on and on and on and they thought they had it.
[02:32:25.807 --> 02:32:31.332]  That's what I was told by people that knew OJ was that it was a family member and he didn't want to burn his family member.
[02:32:31.372 --> 02:32:32.813]  That's why all that went on.
[02:32:33.054 --> 02:32:37.057]  That's part of it, but the other part was they were losing jurors because the trial went on so long.
[02:32:37.077 --> 02:32:42.943]  They thought they had it won and if they put that evidence on they might have lost the 12th juror and there would have been a mistrial declared.
[02:32:43.083 --> 02:32:47.465]  Well, let's get back to F. Lee Bailey, one of the true giants of the 20th century into the 21st.
[02:32:47.585 --> 02:32:52.708]  I mean, one of the top lawyers we hear about, Racehorse Haynes, F. Lee Bailey, Jerry Spence you represent.
[02:32:52.728 --> 02:32:53.849]  I mean, that's about it.
[02:32:53.869 --> 02:32:57.531]  And then, you know, then it goes online like you and others, but I mean, this is one of the top guys.
[02:32:58.391 --> 02:33:00.532]  He just was amazing.
[02:33:00.652 --> 02:33:04.934]  I mean, you know, he broke into the national scene and immediately was prominent.
[02:33:05.495 --> 02:33:08.957]  He represented Sam Shepard, the case that inspired The Fugitive.
[02:33:09.977 --> 02:33:20.102]  And in front of the United States Supreme Court as a young lawyer, winning a new trial for Mr. Shepard by persuading the Supreme Court that the trial was conducted in a carnival-like atmosphere.
[02:33:20.703 --> 02:33:23.264]  And Shepard got a new trial, was ultimately acquitted.
[02:33:23.724 --> 02:33:29.355]  He represented Patty Hearst in connection with her activities in the Symbionese Liberation Army.
[02:33:29.956 --> 02:33:31.398]  He also knew how to play the race card.
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:33.983]  Yeah, well, he knew how to play every card.
[02:33:36.445 --> 02:33:38.946]  Bailey, I guess it's fair to tell this tale.
[02:33:38.966 --> 02:33:43.187]  He's gone, although his body's not yet entirely cold, I suspect.
[02:33:43.207 --> 02:33:47.108]  But, you know, he once said alcohol was his fuel.
[02:33:47.188 --> 02:33:52.870]  So we were working a case some 20 years ago in his house in Brookline, Massachusetts, and he came in with a drink.
[02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:54.750]  I was staying in one room, he was in another.
[02:33:54.770 --> 02:33:55.711]  It was about 10 in the morning.
[02:33:55.731 --> 02:33:56.731]  He said, would you like something?
[02:33:57.102 --> 02:34:00.745]  I said, Lee, I can't drink until after eight, and I'm not much good after I do.
[02:34:01.325 --> 02:34:03.146]  Alcohol is my fuel, he said.
[02:34:03.527 --> 02:34:06.309]  And when he was fueled, there was no stopping him.
[02:34:06.569 --> 02:34:10.252]  Well, there is a study that says that higher IQ people are more apt to be alcoholics.
[02:34:10.672 --> 02:34:19.578]  I've basically stopped drinking, but there is a certain point where it fuels you and it creates a confidence where you don't have any anxiety and you just get to what the heart of the matter is.
[02:34:19.959 --> 02:34:21.500]  But most people can't operate like that.
[02:34:22.097 --> 02:34:24.798]  I always, I'm no dummy, but I'll tell you, two drinks and I'm done.
[02:34:24.818 --> 02:34:27.318]  So, but Bailey, Bailey was a legend.
[02:34:28.219 --> 02:34:34.140]  He, he, he, he just had an... So you think when he gave those speeches at the OJ trial, he was at a few drinks?
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:38.461]  Yeah, I'm not going to speculate about that, but he probably did.
[02:34:38.641 --> 02:34:40.782]  He probably had a few on board, but it wouldn't have stopped him.
[02:34:40.822 --> 02:34:41.742]  It would have just fueled him.
[02:34:41.782 --> 02:34:43.923]  So you go in the bathroom, what do you like to drink?
[02:34:44.443 --> 02:34:45.404]  He was a bourbon man.
[02:34:45.724 --> 02:34:49.485]  And, you know, he liked it neat.
[02:34:49.966 --> 02:34:53.487]  So he would go in the bathroom and drink straight bourbon?
[02:34:53.627 --> 02:34:54.508]  Well, I didn't say that.
[02:34:54.548 --> 02:34:55.848]  I never went into the men's room with him.
[02:34:55.889 --> 02:34:57.749]  I don't ask what other people do in the men's room.
[02:34:58.110 --> 02:34:59.510]  All I know is what I saw.
[02:34:59.670 --> 02:35:04.152]  And that was, here was a guy who had a relentless determination to get to the truth of every case.
[02:35:04.613 --> 02:35:06.514]  And he worked like a dog to get at it.
[02:35:06.594 --> 02:35:07.354]  He was dogged.
[02:35:07.734 --> 02:35:10.836]  And, you know, he eased his way along the way with a drink or two.
[02:35:11.896 --> 02:35:13.317]  But never erred in his judgments.
[02:35:15.162 --> 02:35:18.144]  Well, he has made the jump into hyperspace, as they say.
[02:35:18.624 --> 02:35:24.988]  Well, I suspect there are a bunch of people lining up at the doors of hell looking for him now, saying, hey, plead our case!
[02:35:25.208 --> 02:35:25.788]  We're innocent!
[02:35:25.968 --> 02:35:27.029]  We belong elsewhere!
[02:35:27.229 --> 02:35:28.069]  Take it up with St.
[02:35:28.129 --> 02:35:28.390]  Peter!
[02:35:28.430 --> 02:35:35.434]  And God's probably saying, oh my God, somebody give me an aspirin, because he's going to talk for eternity, the way good lawyers do.
[02:35:37.188 --> 02:35:39.830]  What do you make of Trump coming out against Fauci in the fall of Fauci?
[02:35:40.250 --> 02:35:43.372]  Well, you know, Fauci, I'm good riddance.
[02:35:43.612 --> 02:35:45.493]  I mean, I don't buy the public health state.
[02:35:45.513 --> 02:35:52.097]  You know, I flew down here to see you the other day and I was sitting in an airport with my mask on because it's a violation of federal law not to wear a mask.
[02:35:52.157 --> 02:35:52.437]  Why?
[02:35:52.477 --> 02:35:53.378]  The pandemic's over.
[02:35:53.638 --> 02:35:54.959]  But I'm not, you know, I needed to get here.
[02:35:55.279 --> 02:35:56.680]  And what do I hear?
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:35:59.161]  I felt like I was in Brave New World, Huxley's book.
[02:35:59.521 --> 02:36:02.663]  The CDC, the voice says, requires that you wear masks.
[02:36:02.703 --> 02:36:10.607]  And I was getting ready to say to combat the pandemic when they said, the CDC requires that you wear a mask to prevent the spread of infectious disease.
[02:36:10.908 --> 02:36:11.368]  I thought, what?
[02:36:11.668 --> 02:36:13.349]  Are masks now a permanent part of our lives?
[02:36:13.369 --> 02:36:14.369]  That's what they're moving towards.
[02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:15.630]  Yeah, medical tyranny.
[02:36:15.930 --> 02:36:17.031]  Well, it feels that way.
[02:36:17.111 --> 02:36:18.932]  And I don't want to live in a republic of virtue.
[02:36:19.292 --> 02:36:20.553]  None of us get out of here alive.
[02:36:21.093 --> 02:36:22.934]  They're saying you are originally dirty.
[02:36:23.134 --> 02:36:26.956]  I thought the left was about not worrying and partying, but no, the devil is about enslavement.
[02:36:28.476 --> 02:36:34.279]  They're telling us that, oh, you're dirty, you're bad, you've got this original sin of what you put off, you've got to cover yourself.
[02:36:34.619 --> 02:36:36.220]  Wow, that doesn't sound like too much fun.
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:39.502]  Well, it doesn't sound like too much fun, and it sounds entirely realistic.
[02:36:39.702 --> 02:36:40.802]  Entirely unrealistic.
[02:36:40.862 --> 02:36:41.803]  Who is going to live to 105, 110, 100?
[02:36:41.883 --> 02:36:42.663]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:36:46.658 --> 02:36:47.819]  No more easy times.
[02:36:47.940 --> 02:36:49.361]  The world has gone over the edge.
[02:36:49.962 --> 02:36:54.547]  We built a civilization that was friendly and happy and, compared to previous times, really sweet.
[02:36:55.167 --> 02:36:58.231]  But that veneer of civilization is very, very thin, isn't it, Norm Battis?
[02:36:58.371 --> 02:36:59.132]  It feels that way.
[02:36:59.172 --> 02:37:00.273]  It feels like end times.
[02:37:00.373 --> 02:37:04.498]  I mean, I don't want to sound like an old man, but it feels like the apocalypse is upon us, you know?
[02:37:04.838 --> 02:37:06.679]  If it was ever going to happen, it's teed up now.
[02:37:06.899 --> 02:37:07.539]  It looks that way.
[02:37:07.679 --> 02:37:13.901]  Sometimes, you know, I'm up in northern New England, I look down at the rest of the country, I think, we're sliding off into the abyss, but the rest of the world did much better.
[02:37:14.221 --> 02:37:16.061]  I saw a story in the New York Times, it stunned me.
[02:37:16.322 --> 02:37:20.383]  For the first time ever, by the end of this century, we're going to have net population decrease.
[02:37:20.743 --> 02:37:22.603]  It's like, is the human race gagging?
[02:37:22.623 --> 02:37:23.724]  Has it decided it can't?
[02:37:24.004 --> 02:37:24.904]  Well, that's the articles.
[02:37:24.984 --> 02:37:28.485]  I showed mainline articles saying, get rid of humans, mothers don't have children.
[02:37:28.765 --> 02:37:33.607]  I mean, the liberals are teaching women to die, to be alone, that childbirth is evil.
[02:37:34.287 --> 02:37:35.228]  Somebody got the memo.
[02:37:35.248 --> 02:37:40.013]  The replacement rate for human race is 2.1 children per person per woman.
[02:37:40.133 --> 02:37:41.535]  And right now in the United States it's 1.8.
[02:37:41.895 --> 02:37:44.718]  In South Korea it's 0.95.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:47.041]  Arbitrary statistics.
[02:37:47.221 --> 02:37:51.646]  Germany in the last decade has destroyed 300,000 housing units because there aren't enough people for them.
[02:37:51.966 --> 02:37:54.507]  In South Korea, they can't fill the universities.
[02:37:54.907 --> 02:37:58.848]  China just adopted a three-child-per-person-per-couple policy.
[02:37:58.888 --> 02:37:59.208]  That's right.
[02:37:59.228 --> 02:38:02.829]  Because its population is expected to halve by the end of the century.
[02:38:03.129 --> 02:38:04.229]  So here's the question I have.
[02:38:04.269 --> 02:38:16.113]  We live amid this great abundance and prosperity, but somehow globalism, all this other crap, is making people decide that this is inconsistent with human flourishing, and we're deciding not to reproduce, and we're dying off.
[02:38:16.133 --> 02:38:17.733]  Well, that's because they're building the post-human world.
[02:38:17.753 --> 02:38:19.634]  They're going to make it where robots have to take care of us.
[02:38:19.674 --> 02:38:20.874]  That's Klaus Schwab's plan.
[02:38:21.601 --> 02:38:22.821]  Well, it's working.
[02:38:23.562 --> 02:38:28.724]  And, you know, I mean, while we're on the topic of robots, I mean, here's the thing I worry most about, and I worry about it with Antifa.
[02:38:28.764 --> 02:38:29.464]  Look at these headlines.
[02:38:29.504 --> 02:38:31.965]  The liberals, it's a sacrament to women.
[02:38:32.085 --> 02:38:33.686]  Don't have a baby, have the world.
[02:38:34.006 --> 02:38:35.626]  But really, you're just giving it over to the globalists.
[02:38:35.646 --> 02:38:36.267]  That's all they're saying.
[02:38:36.467 --> 02:38:38.247]  But, I mean, that's just totally asinine.
[02:38:38.387 --> 02:38:39.768]  Give up... Print that for me, too.
[02:38:40.028 --> 02:38:42.169]  Don't have babies because it's bad for the world.
[02:38:42.189 --> 02:38:43.509]  Well, who's the world for?
[02:38:43.789 --> 02:38:44.750]  You know, I mean... Exactly!
[02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:47.131]  They're getting you to decide you're bad and you don't exist.
[02:38:47.171 --> 02:38:48.091]  Give up your life force.
[02:38:48.311 --> 02:38:51.993]  No, and I listen to people talking about... Give up earthlings, you are a disease.
[02:38:52.073 --> 02:38:52.913]  Let us kill you.
[02:38:53.353 --> 02:38:54.113]  We are liberal.
[02:38:54.153 --> 02:38:54.874]  We are liberal.
[02:38:55.214 --> 02:38:58.535]  And after all, the world is just an artificial game.
[02:38:58.815 --> 02:39:02.877]  We're a simulated game by people from people in another universe and another planet.
[02:39:03.117 --> 02:39:07.219]  And they've decided they have enough of us and the world will get better off without the human race.
[02:39:07.899 --> 02:39:09.560]  And they call theologians crazy?
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:12.961]  People believe this stuff and they find creationists... Well, exactly.
[02:39:13.001 --> 02:39:14.522]  They make fun of Christians or other religions.
[02:39:14.562 --> 02:39:16.863]  The globalists have a religion of exterminating ourselves.
[02:39:16.923 --> 02:39:19.045]  That doesn't sound like a very fun simulation!
[02:39:19.265 --> 02:39:22.488]  No, and which part of, you know, creation sounds absurd?
[02:39:23.008 --> 02:39:32.277]  Is it more absurd to believe that we are a computer simulation in an alternative universe we can't see, or that God created the universe out of nothing, for the benefit of humankind, out of his love for us?
[02:39:32.637 --> 02:39:39.241]  I personally find the theology... Yeah, we were given the planet to build and to launch from, and we are the superior species.
[02:39:39.702 --> 02:39:41.783]  Meanwhile, the globalists aren't trying to get rid of us to save the Earth.
[02:39:41.843 --> 02:39:44.125]  They say they're going to override it because they're going to be gods.
[02:39:44.445 --> 02:39:48.147]  They just want us to decide we're obsolete so we don't come to the table of stakeholders.
[02:39:48.288 --> 02:39:50.189]  Here's the hypothesis about Antifa.
[02:39:50.569 --> 02:39:53.692]  I don't like Antifa, but what if they're the canary in the mineshaft?
[02:39:53.932 --> 02:39:56.173]  What if they were the first group to determine, you know what?
[02:39:56.634 --> 02:40:02.098]  Somebody's trying to make us extinct and we're going to fight back and we're going to burn it down if there's not room made for us.
[02:40:02.478 --> 02:40:07.903]  I worry that our official intelligence and the algorithms have decided we can have prosperity at less than full employment.
[02:40:08.123 --> 02:40:09.344]  And Antifa figured it out.
[02:40:09.604 --> 02:40:15.809]  I'm not saying I'm going to protest with them, but I'm saying the gap between Antifa and the rest of us may be narrowing.
[02:40:16.229 --> 02:40:24.827]  Well, Antifa is just a controlled construct for de-industrialization and rioting, but I understand some of the precepts they put out have those views.
[02:40:24.847 --> 02:40:25.007]  Guys!
[02:40:26.334 --> 02:40:42.942]  I just wanted those printouts, because I don't know what happens on my desk, it becomes this black hole, where I was given Trump's statement, I was given an article about Trump, and then one of the guys ran in waving some new Trump statement at me like it was super important, and so I just said, come on in on Live On Air, it's just bringing it to me, thanks.
[02:40:43.362 --> 02:40:44.282]  Thank you so much, crew.
[02:40:44.782 --> 02:40:51.085]  And I don't know where this disappeared like a Bermuda Triangle of my desk, but I got it again.
[02:40:51.145 --> 02:40:51.946]  Thank you so much, crew.
[02:40:52.566 --> 02:40:59.011]  I'm going to be covering this at the first of The War Room, which you're going to be a visiting guest on as well today, at the start of it.
[02:40:59.051 --> 02:41:02.654]  But statement by Donald John Trump, 43rd President of the United States of America.
[02:41:03.513 --> 02:41:12.524]  Now everyone, even the so-called enemy, are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the virus, the China virus, coming from the Wuhan lab.
[02:41:13.125 --> 02:41:17.110]  The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore.
[02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:22.536]  China should pay $10 trillion to America and the world for the death and destruction they've caused.
[02:41:23.157 --> 02:41:25.119]  Now that's out of his statement, but wait a minute.
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:31.788]  I've got video of Trump standing up there with Fauci doing what he said and coming out with his so-called vaccine.
[02:41:32.068 --> 02:41:35.692]  So Trump needs to fully break with Fauci.
[02:41:36.774 --> 02:41:38.436]  This is, I think, Trump's albatross.
[02:41:38.456 --> 02:41:38.916]  What do you think?
[02:41:39.619 --> 02:41:43.520]  You know, I don't know whether there's a return performance for Trump.
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:47.500]  I hear his blog was discontinued because he didn't feel he had enough followers or he was being ridiculed.
[02:41:49.281 --> 02:41:51.081]  Because it wasn't interactive.
[02:41:51.161 --> 02:41:53.161]  It was a message board.
[02:41:53.561 --> 02:41:55.282]  So this statement is appealing to whom?
[02:41:55.722 --> 02:41:57.942]  What he's telling us is, look, this is a China virus.
[02:41:57.962 --> 02:42:03.163]  We have evidence that research being done there was consistent with the virus as presented in the world.
[02:42:03.263 --> 02:42:04.623]  Fauci knew and he didn't tell us.
[02:42:05.924 --> 02:42:07.944]  Is anybody going to rally to Trump's support about that?
[02:42:08.044 --> 02:42:11.186]  Or are they just going to say, oh, the pandemic's over, let's move on.
[02:42:11.447 --> 02:42:12.427]  We've got the public health.
[02:42:12.447 --> 02:42:13.148]  But it's not over.
[02:42:13.188 --> 02:42:14.089]  It's a global government.
[02:42:14.109 --> 02:42:15.150]  It's lockdowns all over the world.
[02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:22.195]  I mean, I agree with what you're saying, but you understand Trump was manipulated by Fauci, the UN, the globalists launched this on purpose.
[02:42:22.215 --> 02:42:23.076]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:42:23.316 --> 02:42:24.457]  We're the guys that first said that.
[02:42:24.477 --> 02:42:25.197]  And now it's coming out.
[02:42:25.678 --> 02:42:27.479]  We're not like just saying this now opportunistically.
[02:42:27.939 --> 02:42:31.622]  They did this for global control, for UN centric world.
[02:42:32.443 --> 02:42:33.584]  Trump went along with it.
[02:42:33.644 --> 02:42:37.447]  He needs to burn them all and come out against the so-called injections, everything.
[02:42:38.729 --> 02:42:50.539]  If he has evidence that this was a deliberate plot that is world-changing and he should forget anything he knows about national security, any vow, any pledges he took while president, and disclose all of this, I agree.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.841]  You know more about this than I do.
[02:42:53.542 --> 02:42:56.164]  I've not seen the evidence that persuades me this is deliberate.
[02:42:56.584 --> 02:42:58.226]  I've seen evidence... And what you said is key.
[02:42:58.486 --> 02:43:01.709]  I do so many shows and so much that I figure everybody already knows all this.
[02:43:02.289 --> 02:43:03.750]  In the next week, I pledge
[02:43:04.471 --> 02:43:28.528]  To produce a 10-minute report that from start to finish shows how they developed it, prepared it, got it ready, moved it to Wuhan, did war game drills for a lockdown for total power grab, released it to create fear, covered up what was really going on, exaggerated the death toll to then bring in the lockdowns to set up this new society of a taxless society tracking system and show the motive, the history, the background, the lying, the preparation.
[02:43:28.568 --> 02:43:29.789]  I'll put it all in a 10-minute report.
[02:43:30.189 --> 02:43:33.010]  I'm going to see, look, you know where you got me hooked?
[02:43:33.130 --> 02:43:35.931]  Cashless Society Total Control, because we're there.
[02:43:36.371 --> 02:43:37.732]  I mean, I'm going to stores right now.
[02:43:37.772 --> 02:43:39.313]  I'm here as your guest here in Austin.
[02:43:39.573 --> 02:43:40.913]  I go to a bookstore the other night.
[02:43:40.953 --> 02:43:41.834]  They won't take cash.
[02:43:41.874 --> 02:43:42.814]  They've got to use a credit.
[02:43:42.894 --> 02:43:45.435]  And they used COVID to say it's dirty, but now it's not COVID.
[02:43:45.455 --> 02:43:46.175]  Look at this.
[02:43:46.295 --> 02:43:47.536]  EU Cashless Society announced.
[02:43:47.556 --> 02:43:48.496]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:43:48.716 --> 02:43:49.076]  There it is.
[02:43:49.096 --> 02:43:51.617]  So again, it's not the COVID passport that it was.
[02:43:51.677 --> 02:43:52.858]  It's now a cashless passport.
[02:43:53.098 --> 02:43:56.181]  And you've got to wear your masks to avoid infection.
[02:43:56.221 --> 02:43:58.022]  It's not COVID, it's general infection.
[02:43:58.462 --> 02:44:10.272]  We're at a point where people are afraid to come out of their houses, where there's total surveillance, and where every move, every purchase you make... We've been put into a global martial law, and now we're in a laboratory to see what we're put up with.
[02:44:11.052 --> 02:44:12.392]  Well, the answer is quite a lot.
[02:44:12.733 --> 02:44:14.273]  I don't see a lot of sign of pushback.
[02:44:14.353 --> 02:44:15.173]  I really, really don't.
[02:44:15.213 --> 02:44:19.214]  Your show, I hear a few other people talk, but most everybody is still afraid.
[02:44:19.535 --> 02:44:21.115]  Up in New England, people are still afraid.
[02:44:21.395 --> 02:44:23.356]  You'd think the pandemic was still in full force.
[02:44:23.816 --> 02:44:28.457]  But see, they're into the fun of the fear and the wearing the mask and being in it together.
[02:44:28.497 --> 02:44:30.958]  You've got to explain to them that it's a corporate takeover.
[02:44:31.278 --> 02:44:34.559]  I do, but this is where I need to learn from you.
[02:44:34.979 --> 02:44:36.339]  You study this more closely.
[02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:37.980]  I'm involved in cases day to day.
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:41.341]  I don't see the corporate takeover as obviously as you do.
[02:44:41.661 --> 02:44:48.182]  I see them benefiting from this and benefiting from chaos and opportunistically cramming it down our throats.
[02:44:48.603 --> 02:44:57.785]  I don't see evidence of planning and somehow, you know, that's where you and I... Well, that's Event 201, that's Crimson Contagion, that's Operation Lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation and Gates.
[02:44:58.125 --> 02:45:00.245]  Like, you notice the emails on Fauci, it's all Bill Gates.
[02:45:00.606 --> 02:45:06.027]  Because Bill Gates went around with the money to fund all this because the big foundations were all eugenicists.
[02:45:06.787 --> 02:45:07.648]  You know about how U.S.
[02:45:07.688 --> 02:45:08.868]  financiers funded Hitler, right?
[02:45:08.948 --> 02:45:09.068]  I do.
[02:45:09.088 --> 02:45:12.150]  New York Times articles and Pulitzer Prize winning books on that.
[02:45:12.490 --> 02:45:14.491]  That same group went underground after Hitler.
[02:45:15.132 --> 02:45:17.133]  And they took over the medical system, and that's what this is.
[02:45:17.173 --> 02:45:19.114]  This is, they've been waiting and planning.
[02:45:19.634 --> 02:45:20.234]  They're not Nazi.
[02:45:20.254 --> 02:45:21.455]  They're the people that created the Nazis.
[02:45:21.495 --> 02:45:22.095]  No, I got you, I got you.
[02:45:22.115 --> 02:45:23.356]  So they've been waiting and planning.
[02:45:23.396 --> 02:45:23.956]  This is their move.
[02:45:24.396 --> 02:45:28.158]  What do you make of the fact that Bill Gates now owns more farmland in the United States?
[02:45:28.238 --> 02:45:30.780]  Well, he knows under a global collapse, that's the only thing that's going to be valuable.
[02:45:31.665 --> 02:45:33.086]  I find that stunning.
[02:45:34.227 --> 02:45:34.827]  I find it stunning.
[02:45:34.847 --> 02:45:36.568]  He owns more farmland than anybody.
[02:45:36.588 --> 02:45:45.234]  And they're getting ready to get rid of all the jobs, but then if you accept being tracked, taking injections, thumbprinting to buy and sell, you'll be given a subsistence amount by them.
[02:45:47.509 --> 02:45:49.510]  This is a human domestication process.
[02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:55.133]  I recently re-read George Orwell's 1984 and I concluded he was way too optimistic.
[02:45:55.433 --> 02:46:00.155]  When he fought Big Brother, Big Brother had remote technology to track people and to squash people.
[02:46:00.435 --> 02:46:03.297]  Now we squash ourselves and we welcome it with social media.
[02:46:03.637 --> 02:46:04.838]  Well that's what Huxley said.
[02:46:04.878 --> 02:46:10.761]  He said that when he gave a speech at Berkeley in 61, he said we will censor ourselves.
[02:46:11.041 --> 02:46:12.282]  Well, he's right about that, too.
[02:46:12.602 --> 02:46:14.603]  I mean, we don't take Soma.
[02:46:14.623 --> 02:46:25.247]  We go online and we drug ourselves with the hits we get from the endorphins when we see... Well, you're going to be co-hosting today part of the show, The War Room, Owen Stroyer, at 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:46:25.287 --> 02:46:26.228]  Great job to the crew.
[02:46:26.748 --> 02:46:35.712]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, but I'm about to go cover live at Infowars.com forward slash show and on stations across the country, Trump coming out against Fauci.
[02:46:35.732 --> 02:46:39.754]  The fall of Fauci is here, but will his fall bring down the rest of the New World Order?
[02:46:39.794 --> 02:46:40.374]  That's up to us.
[02:46:45.413 --> 02:46:56.500]  I'm in a very good positive mood because despite all the horrible things the globalists have done in the last 16 months with their COVID takeover operation, humanity is really responding and waking up.
[02:46:57.281 --> 02:47:01.003]  We are seeing amazing things happen to their entire agenda.
[02:47:01.444 --> 02:47:10.410]  And in places like Texas, the governor's finally woken up and is saying thousand dollar fines for any business that tries to make people coming in and wear masks because masks don't work.
[02:47:10.710 --> 02:47:11.410]  It's all a fraud.
[02:47:11.811 --> 02:47:13.071]  COVID's been completely overblown.
[02:47:13.552 --> 02:47:14.833]  Fauci has had to come out.
[02:47:15.653 --> 02:47:18.935]  In late May and say, hey, it may have come out of the lab.
[02:47:18.975 --> 02:47:22.637]  It may have come out of Wuhan when he was the one funding gain of function.
[02:47:23.017 --> 02:47:25.499]  He was the one funding the COVID research.
[02:47:25.539 --> 02:47:30.702]  So the fact that he's having to admit that shows he knows that it's all going to come out.
[02:47:31.062 --> 02:47:32.783]  And so he's doing damage control.
[02:47:33.804 --> 02:47:42.929]  If we expose how they purposely released this to create global fear and launch their great reset, they're not just going to not be able to launch another lockdown in their future.
[02:47:43.149 --> 02:47:44.190]  They're going to go to prison.
[02:47:45.578 --> 02:47:46.639]  We need Nuremberg too.
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:50.502]  And a lot of other exciting positive things have been happening as well.
[02:47:51.103 --> 02:48:06.297]  One of the big ones is the fact that despite the COVID lockdowns, the attack on the supply chain, and huge supplement shortages that are all over the news for the vital vitamins and minerals and other cofactors, getting to market because of the shutdown,
[02:48:06.897 --> 02:48:11.920]  We have been able to get DNA Force Plus that's been sold out for more than seven months back in stock.
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:25.367]  DNA Force Plus, ladies and gentlemen, has the PQQ, the CoQ10, and all the other key ingredients that are known to clean out your cells, to clean out your mitochondria, to make your telomeres last longer.
[02:48:25.788 --> 02:48:29.650]  It's even connected to nerve regeneration and
[02:48:30.310 --> 02:48:30.791]  Regrowth?
[02:48:31.171 --> 02:48:32.493]  You've got to look it up.
[02:48:32.573 --> 02:48:35.497]  I only covered a few of the ingredients in DNA Force Plus.
[02:48:35.937 --> 02:48:41.525]  It's the very best out there, and it's 40% off despite the fact it's been sold out for more than seven months.
[02:48:41.865 --> 02:48:43.046]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:48:43.287 --> 02:48:44.148]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:48:44.208 --> 02:48:44.789]  Back in stock.
[02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:17.431]  I don't talk enough about Prostegard.
[02:49:18.391 --> 02:49:33.617]  Now, when we developed this product more than six years ago, all I did was look at the market of vitamins and minerals and herbs and say, what is recognized even by the government agencies as something that absolutely on record works for say the prostate?
[02:49:34.277 --> 02:49:35.898]  That half the population has one.
[02:49:36.938 --> 02:49:39.180]  And that, of course, is Salt Palmetto.
[02:49:39.841 --> 02:49:49.388]  And I noticed that Salt Palmetto formulas were selling for $25, $35, $40, and Salt Palmetto is not very expensive to get, even high quality like we have.
[02:49:49.848 --> 02:49:51.029]  So I said, let's go further.
[02:49:51.049 --> 02:50:00.797]  Let's go to a top developer and see what else would be good in an all-around formula, not just for the prostate, but for all your glands, and not just men, but women as well.
[02:50:00.817 --> 02:50:06.081]  They've just got the studies on the prostate for decades, and that's documented, settled science.
[02:50:06.701 --> 02:50:16.451]  And talking to big formulators and scientists, they said, yeah, add a bunch of vitamins and minerals to it and that fusion of it will be also better for the body and better for your glands.
[02:50:16.931 --> 02:50:19.313]  And so it has become one of our top 10 sellers.
[02:50:19.734 --> 02:50:24.719]  People really love it, especially since the stuff we've seen in the last year or so happened around the world.
[02:50:24.779 --> 02:50:27.141]  People have really gotten concerned about their immune systems.
[02:50:27.521 --> 02:50:31.305]  So we noticed a lot of women were ordering it as well because it really is a good
[02:50:31.605 --> 02:50:32.405]  Thank you.
[02:50:51.690 --> 02:50:55.392]  And it's 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:50:55.452 --> 02:51:00.714]  And it's just really is incredible what these herbs that God gave us on this planet do.
[02:51:01.114 --> 02:51:04.115]  This is the natural medicine that God gave us.
[02:51:04.635 --> 02:51:09.697]  And I know so many people who've had their lives changed and have been made so much more healthy with Prostagart.
[02:51:09.917 --> 02:51:10.698]  It's back in stock.
[02:51:10.718 --> 02:51:11.298]  Get yours today.
