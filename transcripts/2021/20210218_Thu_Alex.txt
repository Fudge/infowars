[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.391]  They're going to all make it about how ERCOT's idiots and how Texas are idiots.
[00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:05.553]  This was a globalist operation.
[00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:06.493]  We told you it was coming.
[00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.414]  They've done it in California.
[00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:08.214]  I have all the articles.
[00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:10.296]  Enron linked to California blackouts.
[00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.677]  That's 18 years old.
[00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:13.498]  Where they, it all came out.
[00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:15.199]  It was all documentaries were made.
[00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.880]  Books were written.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.781]  They did it on purpose.
[00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.742]  They did it on purpose.
[00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:20.583]  They did it.
[00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:23.084]  They do rolling blackouts to prepare you for higher prices.
[00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:26.046]  Now they're announcing prices up 10,000 times higher.
[00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:27.027]  I'm not joking.
[00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:27.547]  That's Reuters.
[00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:29.669]  I told you they're going to want to federalize the grid.
[00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:37.933]  They're going to want to put control thermostats in all your houses and remote control that are already in most houses via the smart meters and the actual controllers on the walls.
[00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.394]  And now they announced it all today!
[00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:43.336]  I have literally probably 30 articles the guys printed because I knew it was there.
[00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:47.478]  I just said, just print where they blame Texas and print where they say they got to control your thermostat and stop it.
[00:00:47.638 --> 00:00:48.759]  They're like, yeah, there's like hundreds.
[00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.439]  Which ones do you want?
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.561]  I just print 30 of them, you know, just 30.
[00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:54.242]  I didn't even know they were saying that!
[00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:54.823]  I knew they were.
[00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:57.885]  See, because folks, it's the same damn thing.
[00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:03.168]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.954]  My friends, we are kicking off another emergency transmission.
[00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:13.796]  February 18th, 2021, I have come into
[00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.715]  A lot of key information and ideas to take on the globalists in the last 24 hours.
[00:01:23.302 --> 00:01:27.885]  We also understand the enemy's next steps and exactly what they're planning to fully bankrupt the U.S.
[00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:28.706]  and kill the dollar.
[00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:29.607]  But we can stop them.
[00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:30.487]  You can stop them.
[00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:32.569]  But you've got to take action.
[00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:33.870]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:47.720]  But first, we went to the private regulator that's globalist, that's out of state, run by Democrats, ERCOT, that has sabotaged the Texas power grid on purpose for a federal Joe Biden takeover of the Texas grid and more windmills.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.081]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have got all that information as well.
[00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.902]  I went over to their offices in South Austin yesterday.
[00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:58.504]  We're planning a demonstration there on Saturday after we go to the governor's mansion.
[00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:06.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've now announced that the power will be out for a month, off and on, rolling blackouts, training us to no longer have any power, and they're
[00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.871]  Boosting prices as much as 10,000 percent.
[00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:11.592]  That is Reuters, I'm not joking.
[00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.714]  They're following the Enron criminal model.
[00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:15.776]  Here's part of the report that's at Bandot Video.
[00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:18.639]  Texans protest, ERCOT-Enron power scam.
[00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.964]  ERCOT IS ENRON!
[00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:28.748]  ERCOT IS ENRON!
[00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:34.018]  You are criminal!
[00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:38.281]  Shutting off our power!
[00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.581]  We know you, Richard!
[00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:42.684]  The whistleblowers are coming forward!
[00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.305]  Texas has plenty of power!
[00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:46.546]  You are turning us to have less power and take more!
[00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:55.552]  Reuters reports power prices on the open market up 10,000% as you haul the state hostage so outside power groups, like vultures, like Enron did, can feed on us!
[00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:59.735]  You thought because it's been 20 years since Enron did this to the West Coast
[00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:01.216]  You would get away with this.
[00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:04.498]  You are not getting away with it, you criminal!
[00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.743]  And so coming up this Saturday, we're going to protest the big tech, great recent Democrat poll.
[00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:16.986]  Greg Abbott, Ed Noon at the Governor's Mansion.
[00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:17.887]  He's essential.
[00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:18.887]  He's got power.
[00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:25.592]  And then at 2 p.m., we're coming down here on 290 towards the airport.
[00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.294]  We're good to go.
[00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:52.739]  We know they've done it before, they've been caught, and now the whistleblowers are set to go public!
[00:03:52.759 --> 00:04:03.732]  That's why they put this puppet woman in right before they did it, because the people actually running it don't want to go to prison, they want to set her up like Cuomo, but she's part of it too.
[00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.093]  You're all going to prison!
[00:04:17.697 --> 00:04:18.778]  This is serious, folks.
[00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:20.239]  This is war.
[00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.401]  They're shutting our energy systems off by design.
[00:04:25.302 --> 00:04:26.343]  They know what they're doing.
[00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:27.564]  They're technocrats.
[00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:29.145]  They think you're so stupid to figure it out.
[00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:31.646]  Figure it out or we overrun and starve to death.
[00:04:32.247 --> 00:04:33.668]  They're about to kill the US dollar.
[00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:36.209]  They're signaling worldwide that the US is over.
[00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.252]  So at least once they crash the economy, remember who did this to you.
[00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:41.393]  Remember!
[00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:43.034]  This is war, people.
[00:04:43.314 --> 00:04:43.954]  This isn't a joke.
[00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:46.176]  Notice the globalist criminals!
[00:04:47.486 --> 00:05:02.099]  ERCOT Chairwoman Sally, the Democrat, Tolbert, and their other globalist accomplices, whistleblowers inside your organization, as well as the EPA and Texas government, are prepared to come forward and expose your giant Enron-style scam.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:14.270]  You'll hear my order, by leave of the people, to cease and desist your staged blackout designed to condition Americans to accept the Great Reset and the carbon credit rationing.
[00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:19.088]  Justice Governor Cuomo will be sent to prison for his crimes against humanity.
[00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.269]  You will be held accountable.
[00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:33.533]  One last time, we are aware of your criminal enterprise to trick the public into accepting smart meter monitoring of thermostats and to jack up power prices as much as 10,000%.
[00:05:33.573 --> 00:05:36.394]  Stop your criminal activity now.
[00:05:36.454 --> 00:05:38.395]  We the people are watching Alex Jones.
[00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:50.779]  A lot of negative bad things have happened and we've been honest about those and we've been accurate about those so that we can stand up against it and stop it.
[00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:14.997]  There's also a lot of really positive things going on and really good things happening that I haven't spent enough time telling you about.
[00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:30.860]  And there's also not enough of us on this broadcast particularly that's so influential putting out original ideas and battle plans that are peaceful, truthful, and effective to stop this takeover that is taking place.
[00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:45.343]  But the good news is mainline conservatives, mainline nationalists, mainline Americans across the board are understanding what's really happening and that this is a corporate
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:07:09.638]  Crisis system, a crisis capitalist system where it's not free market, but where technocrats use their AI control and use their instrumentation that dials into every basically modern machine to manipulate economies to consolidate power and control.
[00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.823]  And to really destroy civilization through that vertical integration.
[00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:18.638]  So where are we laying that out today?
[00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.339]  This is just such a teachable moment for all of us.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.780]  All the different things that are unfolding.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:32.723]  Biden and the bills that are introduced that he says he'll sign to register all guns and ban all semi-autos and all magazines up to or over 10 rounds.
[00:07:35.316 --> 00:07:42.721]  Openly saying the border's wide open and no one coming in will be tested for COVID or any other disease, but citizens will have to be tested to go to the movie theater or have a job.
[00:07:43.102 --> 00:07:44.082]  Internal checkpoints.
[00:07:44.943 --> 00:07:49.326]  The really huge news is Tucker Carlson is now really understanding how serious things are.
[00:07:49.847 --> 00:07:57.953]  The Democrats have hired former General Honoré, who is a leftist, globalist, anti-American, communist, and also an anti-white racist.
[00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:00.054]  Just a monstrous person.
[00:08:00.674 --> 00:08:03.275]  General Honore wants to go to war with the American people.
[00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:09.377]  He wants the CIA and the US Army to hunt down and wage war on us.
[00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:12.179]  So, absolutely criminal.
[00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:15.280]  And Tucker Carlson did an excellent job last night laying that out.
[00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:24.241]  Also, I have talked to people very close to the President, and they told me last week that Trump is preparing to really go on the offense again.
[00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:32.749]  You're starting to see that happen here in just the last few days, and some very exciting things there.
[00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.053]  Trump now does know that they ordered half the police to stand down at the Capitol.
[00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:49.683]  They do know that the Democrats bragged in the Time Magazine article that they had provocateurs in there and intended to try to incite the giant Trump crowd to do it and that they had their leftists basically disguised.
[00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:57.888]  That is all starting to come out and General Honore, day one and day two said,
[00:08:58.902 --> 00:09:12.881]  That the Sergeant of Arms and the Capitol Police are terrorists with no evidence and that they were planning to kill everybody inside when he knows damn well their Q operators were the ones manipulating the few hundred that actually went in.
[00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:28.835]  And that indeed Trump had no idea it was happening, but the Democrats basically helped orchestrate the whole thing and had FBI agents inside the Proud Boys and inside of the Oath Keepers and inside with the Antifa.
[00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:34.356]  Actually directing the first breach.
[00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:39.156]  Then the Cutards went inside and stayed within the velvet ropes.
[00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.957]  And they're all, of course, having the book thrown at them.
[00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:48.698]  And I told you all of this at the time that the young Antifa commander was probably being funded.
[00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:50.679]  And see if the archivist can find this.
[00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:54.359]  I said this on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of January.
[00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:58.400]  I said, I believe CNN is funding and commanding
[00:09:59.574 --> 00:10:01.015]  The Black Antifa leader.
[00:10:02.176 --> 00:10:12.743]  Well it turns out he was given $70,000 by CNN and another unit and they did have embedded CNN reporter with them and more.
[00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:21.349]  I mean I know spies when I look at them and I could just take one look at him on Anderson Cooper.
[00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:27.881]  And all the rest of it, and knew instantly what was going on, but that is now coming out in the mainstream news.
[00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:40.065]  It was on InfoWars over the weekend, but now it's in the big law enforcement publications that there were FBI agents leading and commanding, FBI commanders, leading and commanding all three of the groups.
[00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:44.567]  That's why they had to arrest Enrique Atario at the airport.
[00:10:44.607 --> 00:10:47.448]  They now admit was to stop him leading the group, because he wouldn't have been violent.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.965]  But instead, ladies and gentlemen, these guys absolutely set us up and it was a criminal operation.
[00:10:56.685 --> 00:10:59.627]  And so Trump is codifying the information.
[00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.049]  He's getting it together and preparing to go public.
[00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:07.512]  And Trump is going to have his own conference, his own symposium, his own trial.
[00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:18.380]  Because as soon as they learn that Trump knew all of this and Lindsey Graham was going to bring witnesses, that Pelosi ordered a stand down the day before and ordered the intelligence briefing not be given to the rest of Congress.
[00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:21.824]  The minute that happened, they stopped last Saturday.
[00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:25.149]  We've been overshadowed by the snowstorm and the power outages.
[00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:34.081]  They ended the trial a week early and said no witnesses because they had had their whole system called on them.
[00:11:35.034 --> 00:11:36.315]  And so I'm going to break all this down.
[00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:53.473]  That's why Honore came out on the 6th and 7th and said, the Sergeant of Arms and the police are terrorists, they're white, and they're Trump supporters, and you cannot trust the police and military, and I will help lead a purge of the military, and I will help lead a purge of the police.
[00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:55.275]  Just outrageously insane.
[00:11:56.637 --> 00:12:06.725]  And that, oh, Trump and the Republicans and Alex Jones and Ali Alexander, they were all in the Capitol and planned the attack the day before and were given a tour.
[00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:15.412]  They would then show video from November with us peacefully with Vernon Jones in the Georgia Capitol.
[00:12:17.113 --> 00:12:27.561]  And then because some of the Republicans that spoke at the event with the President had been at the Capitol days before, obviously talking to the representatives, they called that a criminal conspiracy because they were in a criminal conspiracy.
[00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:37.308]  Guys, in fact, print me the Time Magazine article from two weeks ago, please, where they brag that they knew we were coming, they had their people stand down, pose as our people, and just hope for fireworks.
[00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:42.032]  Kind of like they did in Virginia with Charlottesville.
[00:12:43.032 --> 00:12:44.853]  Where they just put two explosive groups together.
[00:12:44.893 --> 00:13:00.819]  Well, this time they just infiltrated, had the police stand down, had anti-thug, professor type, trained agitators, average age about 60, directing people from the parapets, from the area, to attack, attack, attack.
[00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:03.320]  In fact, witnesses are on record saying, and it's on audio,
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.721]  Saying, attack!
[00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.122]  Alex Jones says attack!
[00:13:06.182 --> 00:13:07.062]  Take it, it's yours!
[00:13:07.302 --> 00:13:08.003]  Trump's coming!
[00:13:08.043 --> 00:13:08.463]  Take it!
[00:13:08.523 --> 00:13:08.883]  Take it!
[00:13:08.924 --> 00:13:09.284]  Take it!
[00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:13.327]  And the Q people had all been told that online by 8chan and the globalist operatives.
[00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:14.507]  They believed they were talking to Trump.
[00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.869]  They were talking to, obviously, Biden and the Chaikovs.
[00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.511]  And so, they hit.
[00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:22.733]  And they broke through the police, who were not part of it.
[00:13:23.654 --> 00:13:26.596]  And the police were absolutely overwhelmed, and it was terrible what happened to them.
[00:13:26.936 --> 00:13:28.277]  That's just the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:30.158 --> 00:13:32.199]  The system wants to play us off against each other.
[00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:32.820]  Here's an example.
[00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:37.873]  The power has been out in many parts of Austin going on day six.
[00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:40.574]  And it was a lot more homes than they said.
[00:13:40.614 --> 00:13:41.494]  It was most of the city.
[00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.415]  And people know it was done by design.
[00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:44.495]  And folks understand that.
[00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:46.076]  I'm going to lay all that evidence out today as well.
[00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:48.895]  And
[00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:10.407]  Bring them some coffee or a donut or something.
[00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:13.349]  They've got their family stuck at home, most of them without power as well.
[00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:29.700]  But the media gets to focus on the few, you know, idiots that are being mean to the utility workers in Texas, when the real anger should be directed at the governor that let the windmills in and got all the awards from the left, Greg Abbott, and from ERCOT that's run by a bunch of Democrats.
[00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:31.522]  The whole board is Democrat.
[00:14:32.902 --> 00:14:37.926]  Five of the board don't live in Texas, and one of them works for Governor Whitmer in Michigan.
[00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:40.816]  Talk about double dipping.
[00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:51.206]  And I have family and I know folks that work at power plants and they've been ordered to power those plants down in the last few months by ERCOT so they can embarrass Texas.
[00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:53.769]  They already shut down over 100 of our plants before that.
[00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:56.551]  Most of Austin is off the damn windmills now.
[00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:58.033]  That's why Austin's worst hit in the state.
[00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:16.694]  The whole left did this, but now I have hundreds of articles, literally hundreds in front of me, New York Times, you name it, saying, Texas is over, Texas is idiots, it shows Texas isn't an energy state, Texas can't take care of itself, Texas can't find a task with both hands, and we need to come in with green energy and take over Texas, and Biden's pledging to do it.
[00:15:17.094 --> 00:15:19.215]  This is technocratic sabotage 101.
[00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:26.057]  We told you last week that they'd be having shutdowns of the power, now they say it'll be off and on for a month, and they're jacking up the prices.
[00:15:28.703 --> 00:15:37.409]  The bad news is, the New World Order's here, it's taken over, and it's going to do horrible, horrible things before it finally runs to ground.
[00:15:41.252 --> 00:15:49.598]  The good news, though, we've not been caught completely flat-footed.
[00:15:51.544 --> 00:16:04.554]  We have a very serious cadre of human beings who are race, color, and creed across this planet that are aware of the entire New World Order system and who know how to stop it and who know what it's going to do next.
[00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:15.243]  So as they engineer the collapse of civilization, as they engineer the collapse of the family, as they engineer the collapse of our genetics, it will become completely apparent to everyone
[00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:22.142]  That they've been caught in a trap and that the Davos Group, the UN, the globalists, Bill Gates, are their mortal enemy.
[00:16:22.602 --> 00:16:25.783]  Bill Gates is the most unpopular person on planet Earth.
[00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.925]  He's come out as our master, our king, our ruler.
[00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:31.846]  Everybody knows he's called for depopulations.
[00:16:32.207 --> 00:16:36.268]  Everybody knows he's been thrown out of 30 plus countries, killing people, obtaining vaccines on purpose.
[00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:38.910]  Everybody knows he's a Joseph Mingala on steroids.
[00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.372]  So is his father and his mother and his horrible pig-like wife and family.
[00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:45.885]  They're all very bad people.
[00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:53.272]  The children are now adult, running their evil eugenics mouths, shooting their mouths off about getting rid of the useless eaters, and I say they should go first.
[00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:54.734]  I'm not going to do anything violent.
[00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:56.716]  I'm just saying there's too many people, Bill Gates.
[00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.517]  Blow your head off then, buddy.
[00:16:58.537 --> 00:16:59.498]  Show us how it's done.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.305]  Walk out into town square, walk up on a gallows, kick the switch, and, you know, break your own neck there, pal.
[00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:08.107]  Then I'll start respecting you and listening to you.
[00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.415]  But you get to have kids, you get to have jets, you get to have all the money, but you tell us we are not essential?
[00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:15.175]  No!
[00:17:15.516 --> 00:17:19.279]  That's a declaration of war, you little bastard in that stupid pink shirt!
[00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:23.443]  So let me lay this out for you.
[00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:31.330]  The good news is, we're not going quietly into the good night.
[00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:48.756]  And so, Gates is kind of laying low for about six months and now there's giant PR pushes in every major magazine, every major TV network, comedy shows, drama programs, movies, documentaries, news programs, Wired magazine, guys show the cover.
[00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:55.462]  Bill Gates, the man to save the world, but will we listen to him and do what the scammer said?
[00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:11.933]  He was one of the most hated people in the 90s, and now he spends billions on PR, and with him is the whole train of eugenics, and globalism, and synthetic meat, and eating bugs, and freezing to death in the winter, and having no energy, because it's so chic!
[00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:20.898]  And he publicly underwrites these programs, where he's the hero.
[00:18:21.758 --> 00:18:22.459]  He's the hero.
[00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:25.442]  That's an old cover, guys.
[00:18:25.482 --> 00:18:26.323]  Just type this in.
[00:18:26.343 --> 00:18:27.964]  It was an article on InfoWars on Tuesday.
[00:18:28.484 --> 00:18:30.045]  I've really been wanting to show it to people.
[00:18:31.006 --> 00:18:34.648]  And the exact headline was, Bill Gates, the man to save the world.
[00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:38.191]  Just type in Bill Gates wired magazine cover.
[00:18:38.711 --> 00:18:39.892]  And it's a huge media push.
[00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:43.915]  He's everywhere saying, oh, we're going to have to have climate
[00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:49.267]  Shutdowns, climate lockdowns, and all of this.
[00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:53.770]  And then, oh, COVID taught us to stay in our houses and telecommute.
[00:18:54.250 --> 00:19:02.136]  And COVID taught us that we're not going to be able to have an economy anymore.
[00:19:02.796 --> 00:19:04.137]  Oh, but he gets even richer.
[00:19:04.417 --> 00:19:06.679]  He gets even more powerful.
[00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:08.440]  Here, I'll pull it up on my phone.
[00:19:10.131 --> 00:19:10.751]  It's no big deal.
[00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:14.314]  I'll pull it up, though, because I've got to have the article with him on the cover of the deal.
[00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:15.654]  This is the Savior of the Earth, or I'll do it.
[00:19:18.456 --> 00:19:21.698]  Go through these for you, and I will pull that up.
[00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:23.079]  Here it is.
[00:19:23.219 --> 00:19:24.119]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.160]  There it is.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.440]  Boom.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.844]  Bill Gates planned to save the world.
[00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:33.485]  We can reach zero carbon.
[00:19:33.846 --> 00:19:34.506]  Here's how.
[00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:37.108]  Zero carbon.
[00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:38.909]  We're based on carbon.
[00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.091]  Plants breathe carbon.
[00:19:42.352 --> 00:19:44.133]  The whole planet's covered in carbon.
[00:19:44.353 --> 00:19:48.276]  It's how we've got so much of it under the ground, because there's been so much of it on the surface.
[00:19:49.297 --> 00:19:50.978]  We're a carbon-based life form.
[00:19:55.046 --> 00:19:59.868]  Imagine if aliens landed and they said, we want you to give up your carbon based life form status.
[00:20:00.629 --> 00:20:03.050]  Do as we say, we will allow you to live a short period of time.
[00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.591]  We are going to begin changing your DNA.
[00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:06.991]  This is your ruler.
[00:20:07.192 --> 00:20:08.112]  His name is Bill Gates.
[00:20:08.972 --> 00:20:09.793]  Now do what he says.
[00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:12.503]  You know, let me see who Bill Gates is.
[00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:16.244]  Oh, he wants to kill everybody and wants to get rid of old people and says we're overpopulated.
[00:20:17.024 --> 00:20:25.746]  And you can actually make the argument that there are a bunch of people that just watch TV all day and lay around and there are people starving all over the world and there's a lot of problems on the planet.
[00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:40.669]  But let's be honest that Bill Gates is a psychotic and that Bill Gates's group is the group that just 70, 80 years ago was funding Adolf A. Louis Hitler on record.
[00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:43.506]  The same names, the same people.
[00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:49.910]  Cold Springs Harbor, Warren Buffet, all of them, these are super villains!
[00:20:52.532 --> 00:21:01.778]  And he wants to control your body, he wants to control your reproduction, he wants to control your energy, and I've got all the articles right here where he says he's gonna run your life along with Klaus Schwab.
[00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:08.002]  Klaus Schwab is in Europe saying he's gonna run Europe and Asia, Xi Jinping's gonna run China,
[00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:11.536]  And Bill Gates is going to run America and Europe as well.
[00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:16.847]  I mean, Bill Gates is again now the shadow head of the G8 this year.
[00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:25.721]  That's not normal to have them announcing that, oh, I take my orders, Boris Johnson said, because I'm the head of the G8 this year on the rotating seat, from Bill Gates.
[00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:28.302]  And look, I've got hundreds of articles and hundreds of video clips to play.
[00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:31.663]  Why do I just keep saying that every hour the last few days?
[00:21:32.544 --> 00:21:40.406]  Because when they tell you on the news that Bill Gates heads up the G8, you're in a technocracy, a dictatorship of technocrats.
[00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:46.008]  Bloomberg has articles out saying we need a world dictatorship of technocrats
[00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:54.374]  Where they tell you what to eat, how to sleep, where you can go, who you can marry, if you can marry, if you can have kids, all of this, and China has been the model.
[00:21:57.956 --> 00:22:07.701]  And how big your house is gonna be, that's why it's, oh, sexy little tiny houses, and oh, now you live in a van by the river, it's so chic, because you can't have kids like that living in a van.
[00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:11.042]  You can't have the American dream, you can't continue on.
[00:22:12.743 --> 00:22:15.565]  And then they're gonna cut off the power, they're not gonna let you be by the river.
[00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:20.618]  Oh, they're saying, oh, don't worry, you can't afford an apartment, don't worry, you can't afford a house, don't worry!
[00:22:20.858 --> 00:22:29.481]  It's, you know, Time Magazine, New York Times, you go to Whole Foods, and they have huge sections of how chic it is to be poor, and how chic it is to have nothing.
[00:22:30.888 --> 00:22:48.181]  And you'll see these young, rich, trust fund kids, you know, with the trendy, you know, sexy, good-looking guy with a sexy, good-looking girlfriend, and they're all in the back of the Volkswagen van, and, oh, they've got a baby, and then you learn the guy's got $50 million in the bank, and it's all just sick.
[00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:52.842]  Sick, crazy people that do whatever they're told by the New York, L.A.
[00:22:52.962 --> 00:22:56.243]  scene to act like, and they're the schmucks of the planet.
[00:22:56.543 --> 00:23:07.685]  We are all led by a bunch of twisted, decadent, crazy, rich people whose only pleasure now is making you be poor and you austere and you have nothing.
[00:23:07.985 --> 00:23:13.346]  Which, by the way, was the number one world system for all of human development through feudalism in the last 10,000 years.
[00:23:14.972 --> 00:23:24.289]  Every time it's set up where royalty had all the food and all the money and all the power, they kept you super poor and starving so that you couldn't get up and so you were so busy trying to get food.
[00:23:25.441 --> 00:23:26.701]  That you would never stand against them.
[00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:39.185]  They always call, whether it was Japan, or whether it was ancient England, or ancient France, or Rome, they would always call the peasants the little people, because usually the nobles were a foot or two taller from generation to generation of a big diet.
[00:23:39.845 --> 00:23:42.926]  Even the ruling class in China are all big, tall, six foot two guys.
[00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:44.326]  Everybody else is like five feet tall.
[00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:46.667]  Because you don't get food.
[00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:48.007]  It's their control.
[00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:48.907]  You will own nothing.
[00:23:49.147 --> 00:23:50.168]  You will have nothing.
[00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:51.348]  And you will like it.
[00:23:52.128 --> 00:23:53.790]  Haha, so liberal!
[00:23:54.090 --> 00:24:01.018]  We'll be right back on the other side with General Honore and the Democrats' plans publicly to send the army to your house to kill you and your family.
[00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:05.604]  Now I said, back in November when Biden began stealing the election,
[00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.613]  That the first thing he'd do when he got in was start a purge of the U.S.
[00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:25.040]  military, calling anyone that's pro-America or anyone that's pro-gun, anyone that has any post promoting come and take it, or Donald Trump, or Alex Jones, or George Washington for that matter, as being a terrorist and a white supremacist.
[00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:27.762]  And you saw exactly that start.
[00:24:28.755 --> 00:24:31.757]  And they've got the 30,000 National Guards still in D.C.
[00:24:32.257 --> 00:24:36.740]  to be harassed, vetted, infiltrated, spied on, messed with.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.842]  I'm told from sources it's had the exact opposite effect.
[00:24:40.863 --> 00:24:44.846]  The military was somewhat awake to the globalists, but the last few months in D.C.
[00:24:45.206 --> 00:24:48.328]  has the National Guard really, really getting hardcore.
[00:24:48.948 --> 00:24:57.414]  So that's the thing about these communists, is they've done this in China, they've done this in Russia, they've done this in other places where people never really had a history of freedom.
[00:24:58.922 --> 00:25:08.009]  Americans may be spoiled, we may have problems, but we've had a history of freedom and we have a memory of freedom and so the National Guard is really getting turned off against what's happening.
[00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:14.833]  They're having a litmus test of will you fire on Americans if they're terrorists, quote.
[00:25:15.254 --> 00:25:17.035]  That's whoever they say is a terrorist.
[00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:20.678]  And so Tucker Carlson's now really hammering on this, but I thought
[00:25:21.772 --> 00:25:22.932]  I would get to part of his report.
[00:25:23.913 --> 00:25:29.834]  And then I would walk through what's really going on and what they're planning next.
[00:25:29.914 --> 00:25:32.215]  Because we're in the house of the false flag.
[00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:34.216]  We're in that mode.
[00:25:34.556 --> 00:25:36.156]  We're in the planet of the false flag.
[00:25:36.196 --> 00:25:37.136]  We are in the realm.
[00:25:37.397 --> 00:25:38.237]  We are in the age.
[00:25:38.677 --> 00:25:39.777]  That is their next big move.
[00:25:40.717 --> 00:25:43.218]  They're also going to economically squeeze us through power grids.
[00:25:43.398 --> 00:25:44.799]  That's what they always do other places.
[00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:48.120]  And they're also going to squeeze us through the educational system.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.020]  Our jobs are going to
[00:25:50.137 --> 00:25:54.431]  Tighten down the restrictions, loosen them by the summer, and then release new strains.
[00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:56.019]  Thank you.
[00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:28.477]  He was very close friends with Rush Limbaugh, knew Rush Limbaugh when he started out in radio, more big time.
[00:26:29.018 --> 00:26:36.528]  Started out in Missouri, but started out with the format that grew into his current show the last 30 years in California.
[00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:38.911]  I mean, mankind's known him that long.
[00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:42.945]  He's told me a lot of Rush Limbaugh stories and confidence.
[00:26:42.965 --> 00:26:44.146]  He won't tell them on air.
[00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:45.287]  Very interesting.
[00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:48.209]  And the stories I know jive with what Matt Drudge told me.
[00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.831]  They were close friends.
[00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:52.233]  And with the others that know Rush Limbaugh.
[00:26:52.313 --> 00:26:53.874]  I never got a chance to talk to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:26:55.675 --> 00:26:56.696]  I saw him grow a lot.
[00:26:57.297 --> 00:26:58.778]  People are products of their time.
[00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:01.620]  So I didn't like the wars he backed and things like that, but he meant well.
[00:27:01.901 --> 00:27:03.001]  He really believed in America.
[00:27:03.262 --> 00:27:04.082]  He wasn't a globalist.
[00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:05.884]  They tried to censor him.
[00:27:05.904 --> 00:27:06.604]  They tried to block him.
[00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:07.745]  It was a victory to keep him on air.
[00:27:08.165 --> 00:27:09.606]  It's a real sad thing that he's dead now.
[00:27:09.967 --> 00:27:12.549]  So we'll talk about that coming up in the second hour.
[00:27:12.569 --> 00:27:23.357]  But right now, introducing to you, meet Lieutenant General Honoré, a very nasty anti-American globalist that
[00:27:23.957 --> 00:27:25.598]  Totally defamed the Capitol Police.
[00:27:25.778 --> 00:27:26.158]  I was there.
[00:27:26.198 --> 00:27:26.959]  They did no such thing.
[00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:29.740]  They were not working with us to do this.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.801]  We know the left and CNN paid people to do it.
[00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:33.602]  That's all coming out.
[00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:38.644]  They even bragged in an article, the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved 2020 election.
[00:27:38.664 --> 00:27:40.725]  They admit at the end that they knew all about it, were involved.
[00:27:41.466 --> 00:27:43.947]  And so if I had to guess, I think this guy probably ran the operation.
[00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:51.831]  I mean, I told you last week, I said, I bet you my bottom dollar that CNN was paying and commanding
[00:27:52.748 --> 00:28:01.190]  The young black man, whose father is also a major general, far left-righter, received $70,000 from CNN and NBC.
[00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.211]  And they had a CNN camera person embedded.
[00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:05.351]  They tried to hide that identity.
[00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:09.132]  And I just looked at the EMO and I said, I bet Cooper probably was commanding that.
[00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:09.872]  He's CIA.
[00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:14.154]  And I would guess that this other individual is definitely an operative of those guys.
[00:28:14.574 --> 00:28:17.935]  I would look at the girl, and I'm just speculating on that, as the handler.
[00:28:20.256 --> 00:28:26.038]  My successive approximation of it, though, and adding all the information together over time tells me that's what's going on.
[00:28:26.418 --> 00:28:27.078]  So let's go ahead.
[00:28:27.098 --> 00:28:38.841]  This is the general organizing publicly and secretly to take the fight to the American people and to, I guess, redo what the British did in 1775, 1776 with the gun confiscation.
[00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:41.162]  Meet the enemy general coming for you.
[00:28:44.525 --> 00:28:47.528]  It's impugning people with the worst slur they have.
[00:28:48.609 --> 00:28:50.732]  And now it's being used as a pretext
[00:28:51.943 --> 00:28:56.205]  To marshal the force of the state against its own people.
[00:28:57.005 --> 00:28:58.666]  Nancy Pelosi is leading that effort.
[00:28:58.846 --> 00:29:07.349]  She's just announced that someone called retired General Russell Honore of Louisiana will be leading a security review of what happened on January 6th of the riot.
[00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:17.433]  Nancy Pelosi says General Honore has been, quote, assessing our security needs by reviewing what happened on January 6th and how we must ensure that it does not happen again.
[00:29:18.453 --> 00:29:19.334]  But that's not right!
[00:29:20.275 --> 00:29:24.998]  General Honore already has come to conclusions about what happened on January 6th.
[00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:29.682]  He's been very public about that, and you should know what those conclusions are, and what kind of person he is.
[00:29:30.343 --> 00:29:36.187]  Just because his title is General, doesn't mean that he's sane, or not a wild-eyed partisan.
[00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:44.274]  On the day after the Capitol riot, Honore suggested it was an inside job, and that the sergeant-at-arms might be implicated in the plot.
[00:29:45.982 --> 00:29:49.484]  There was some complicit actions at the Capitol Police.
[00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:57.189]  A police chief has been fired, but now we need to look at a special investigation.
[00:29:57.789 --> 00:30:02.612]  Was he complicit along with the Sergeant of Arms in the House and the Senate?
[00:30:03.632 --> 00:30:06.594]  It gives appearance of complicity.
[00:30:07.174 --> 00:30:14.839]  They complied because they might have thought 45 was coming to the Capitol, and they gave way to the protesters.
[00:30:15.623 --> 00:30:17.924]  Who easily breached the Capitol.
[00:30:19.005 --> 00:30:21.887]  This is a crying damn shame.
[00:30:23.027 --> 00:30:23.247]  What?
[00:30:24.308 --> 00:30:28.350]  Speaking of misinformation and conspiracy theories, there's no evidence for any of that.
[00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.131]  It's all made up.
[00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:30.191]  It's crazy.
[00:30:30.752 --> 00:30:31.352]  But he went on.
[00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:40.697]  In a radio interview that same day, General Honore explained that conservatives on the Capitol Police Force were to blame when he was asked about what happened with security.
[00:30:40.758 --> 00:30:41.178]  Watch this.
[00:30:42.794 --> 00:30:47.939]  My percentage, 30 to 40 percent of the line officers are Trumpsters.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.341]  Yes, there you go.
[00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:56.167]  All right.
[00:30:56.367 --> 00:30:56.708]  I got it.
[00:30:56.728 --> 00:30:57.669]  That's the fact, Jack.
[00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:00.782]  How would he know that?
[00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:02.064]  Well, of course he doesn't know that.
[00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:03.145]  He doesn't have any idea.
[00:31:03.165 --> 00:31:06.289]  And who you voted for is irrelevant.
[00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.432]  These are sworn peace officers.
[00:31:08.892 --> 00:31:16.142]  They're doing their job, but General Honore has decided to attack them on the basis of speculation about their political beliefs.
[00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:20.012]  This is a problem, that this guy would be in charge of anything.
[00:31:20.092 --> 00:31:26.055]  And that problem goes beyond General Honoré prejudging what happened at the Capitol on the basis of no knowledge.
[00:31:26.575 --> 00:31:31.238]  Like so many of our country's ex-generals, this guy's an authoritarian, and an unhinged one.
[00:31:31.878 --> 00:31:34.860]  He understands how to use force to achieve political objectives.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:42.763]  And it seems like he's being set up to use his military training against anyone who sees the world differently than he does.
[00:31:42.883 --> 00:31:45.104]  They'll be reclassified as domestic terrorists.
[00:31:45.765 --> 00:31:47.465]  Who are these people and what threat do they pose?
[00:31:47.485 --> 00:31:51.928]  Well, according to General Honore, those threats include the Constitution and our Second Amendment.
[00:31:52.308 --> 00:31:52.728]  For real.
[00:31:53.168 --> 00:31:56.510]  He believes your right to defend yourself is dangerous.
[00:31:57.423 --> 00:31:59.124]  He said that, and we're quoting here.
[00:31:59.544 --> 00:31:59.824]  Quote!
[00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:04.767]  We can't permit Second Amendment rights at First Amendment protests.
[00:32:05.388 --> 00:32:05.728]  Really?
[00:32:05.928 --> 00:32:07.369]  Constitutional scholar, are you?
[00:32:07.869 --> 00:32:12.391]  Imagine a public figure with a general in front of his name making that statement.
[00:32:12.412 --> 00:32:16.094]  This is the guy Nancy Pelosi wants in charge of security.
[00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:19.261]  Honoré is not a fan of the First Amendment either, by the way.
[00:32:19.341 --> 00:32:21.343]  On Twitter, he attacked this network.
[00:32:21.903 --> 00:32:29.010]  He even told people to stop buying the, we can't use it, profanity, the crappy stocks of any company that advertises on Fox News.
[00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.212]  Talking about the stock price of advertisers.
[00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:40.380]  He retweeted posts accusing the social media site Parler of being, and we're quoting now, 100% complicit in the January 6th riot.
[00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:42.102]  This is the guy!
[00:32:43.482 --> 00:32:45.644]  It's like putting Joy Reid in charge of security.
[00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:46.525]  This is insane.
[00:32:47.346 --> 00:32:51.190]  General Honore believes that elected members of Congress, people like U.S.
[00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:56.696]  Representative Lauren Boebert, shouldn't be allowed to fly on commercial aircraft because of her political views.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.521]  Put her on a no-fly list!
[00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:03.703]  He said something similar about Senator Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri.
[00:33:03.783 --> 00:33:09.606]  Quote, this little piece of crap, with his Yale Law degree, should be run out of D.C.
[00:33:09.766 --> 00:33:12.068]  and disbarred ASAP.
[00:33:12.168 --> 00:33:12.988]  Run out of D.C.?
[00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:13.288]  Really?
[00:33:13.308 --> 00:33:14.129]  What do you mean by that?
[00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.230]  Run out of D.C.
[00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.031]  and disbarred.
[00:33:17.171 --> 00:33:18.411]  It's even more powerful.
[00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:20.953]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.232]  Another disgusting Owen yesterday, 70-year-old Rush Limbaugh.
[00:33:25.752 --> 00:33:30.314]  The trailblazed, modern, conservative, nationalist, populist media died.
[00:33:30.434 --> 00:33:31.775]  You can say, oh, well, he wasn't perfect.
[00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:34.456]  He didn't expose the New World Order to the last few years.
[00:33:35.097 --> 00:33:36.498]  Well, yeah, because they take him off the air.
[00:33:36.658 --> 00:33:37.418]  He knew all about it.
[00:33:37.998 --> 00:33:46.123]  The good news is he did stand up for our sovereignty, and he got better over the years, as we all have, if we're on the path of trying to become more informed and more accurate.
[00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:48.904]  And it's a major, major loss.
[00:33:48.964 --> 00:33:50.125]  A lot of people are scrambling.
[00:33:51.226 --> 00:33:53.026]  To try to fill his shoes.
[00:33:53.267 --> 00:33:58.968]  And I can tell you from the insiders in those networks, they don't want a show like that anymore.
[00:33:58.988 --> 00:34:00.668]  They don't want leadership like that anymore.
[00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:04.649]  And so they're looking at replacing Rush Limbaugh with sports.
[00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.450]  And I think that's a terrible idea.
[00:34:09.371 --> 00:34:10.531]  It's an absolutely terrible idea.
[00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:12.191]  People are like, oh, Jones, you're going to be the guy.
[00:34:12.211 --> 00:34:17.913]  I mean, almost every time I talk to Trump, because he loved Limbaugh, he would bring up Rush Limbaugh.
[00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:21.284]  And he would say, man, you know, they say you're going to replace Trump.
[00:34:21.524 --> 00:34:26.927]  I mean, you're going to replace Limbaugh when he retires or goes.
[00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:28.648]  And I'm like, no, sir.
[00:34:28.828 --> 00:34:29.188]  No, sir.
[00:34:29.208 --> 00:34:32.530]  They're not ever going to put me on 600 radio stations, the biggest ones in the country.
[00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.611]  In fact, they're planning to phase out talk radio.
[00:34:36.091 --> 00:34:37.592]  But this is the model of victory.
[00:34:37.612 --> 00:34:38.973]  And I'm talking about with Mancow next hour.
[00:34:39.833 --> 00:34:42.054]  In the 80s, AM radios were turning off.
[00:34:42.134 --> 00:34:43.415]  They were turning the transmitters off.
[00:34:45.868 --> 00:34:54.475]  But Roger Ailes had the idea, because there was so much censorship and conservatism, to launch a conservative network around a strong voice.
[00:34:54.555 --> 00:35:01.020]  And Limbaugh was the first trial case, it took off, and then instead of doing talk radio, Ailes just went on to launch Fox.
[00:35:01.361 --> 00:35:03.442]  So that's where all this came from is Roger Ailes.
[00:35:05.504 --> 00:35:13.511]  Roger Ailes is the first domino, Limbaugh is the second, and then the entire industry of conservative nationalist talk radio that we stand on, that is here,
[00:35:14.502 --> 00:35:24.072]  Now that all the internet censorship is here, all the attacks, all the corruption, we still have those hundreds of radio stations that keep InfoWars on the air, even when they banned us across the internet.
[00:35:24.592 --> 00:35:29.858]  And then off of that great radio audience, we were able to build emergency backup of banned video and InfoWars.com.
[00:35:29.898 --> 00:35:36.705]  So that's why Rush Limbaugh is so important, and so many other people want to make fun of his death, or the left is celebrating.
[00:35:38.217 --> 00:35:42.941]  But they're going to be crying when it's all over, because the awakening is explosive.
[00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:43.361]  It's here.
[00:35:43.401 --> 00:35:44.702]  It's not Q's great awakening.
[00:35:45.062 --> 00:35:47.544]  It's the real great awakening.
[00:35:47.865 --> 00:35:48.745]  It's very, very exciting.
[00:35:49.086 --> 00:36:02.656]  Now let's get back to General Honore, who makes the most threatening, hateful, crazy statements, calling one-third of the military are white supremacists, and one-third of the police are bad Trump supporters, and white people are bad.
[00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:08.767]  Whitest black guy I've ever seen, other than I guess the quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs.
[00:36:09.607 --> 00:36:15.430]  And he's up there going along with the whole globalist program, wanting war with the American people.
[00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.071]  So here's more of what Tucker Carlson had to say about it last night.
[00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:21.132]  ...stock price of advertisers.
[00:36:21.912 --> 00:36:30.276]  He retweeted posts accusing the social media site Parler of being, and we're quoting now, 100% complicit in the January 6th riot.
[00:36:31.216 --> 00:36:32.017]  This is the guy!
[00:36:33.413 --> 00:36:35.555]  It's like putting Joy Reid in charge of security.
[00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:36.437]  This is insane.
[00:36:37.257 --> 00:36:41.122]  General Honore believes that elected members of Congress, people like U.S.
[00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:46.608]  Representative Lauren Boebert, shouldn't be allowed to fly on commercial aircraft because of her political views.
[00:36:48.052 --> 00:36:49.432]  Put her on a no-fly list!
[00:36:50.232 --> 00:36:53.633]  He said something similar about Senator Josh Hawley, the senator from Missouri.
[00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:59.514]  Quote, this little piece of crap with his Yale Law degree should be run out of D.C.
[00:36:59.694 --> 00:37:01.975]  and disbarred ASAP.
[00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:02.915]  Run out of D.C.?
[00:37:02.995 --> 00:37:03.195]  Really?
[00:37:03.215 --> 00:37:04.055]  What do you mean by that?
[00:37:05.335 --> 00:37:06.136]  Run out of D.C.
[00:37:06.176 --> 00:37:06.956]  and disbarred.
[00:37:07.056 --> 00:37:07.656]  This is crazy.
[00:37:08.276 --> 00:37:12.917]  But this is the guy, Nancy Pelosi, is leading the security response to the Capitol riot.
[00:37:14.525 --> 00:37:16.106]  This should really worry you.
[00:37:16.967 --> 00:37:20.210]  Is this really about what happened in the Capitol on January 6th?
[00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.030]  No.
[00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:24.032]  It's about you and your rights.
[00:37:24.553 --> 00:37:28.616]  Rights that people like General Honore and Nancy Pelosi view as the greatest threat of all.
[00:37:29.817 --> 00:37:31.478]  Josh Hawley was singled out by this man.
[00:37:31.518 --> 00:37:32.859]  He joins us now to respond.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.181]  Senator, I appreciate your coming on tonight.
[00:37:35.722 --> 00:37:41.786]  This makes me genuinely nervous that someone like this could have any control over the so-called security at the U.S.
[00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.468]  Capitol or in Washington or in America.
[00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:46.742]  Yeah, it's very disturbing, Tucker.
[00:37:46.782 --> 00:37:50.503]  I mean, some of the statements that the General has made are just downright crazy.
[00:37:50.964 --> 00:37:51.884]  You cited some of them.
[00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:57.266]  I mean, saying that Elise Stefanik, for instance, ought to be treated like a terrorist and not allowed to fly, put on the no-fly list.
[00:37:57.706 --> 00:37:59.347]  Also, his statements about law enforcement.
[00:37:59.387 --> 00:38:08.691]  This is somebody who this whole last year, Tucker, encouraged, condoned the violent rioting in our city, said that federal law enforcement, who were sent to Portland to protect the
[00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:16.773]  They were a mob themselves, said that they were acting like they were serving a dictator, attacked them for not being real soldiers.
[00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:17.513]  Those are his words.
[00:38:17.553 --> 00:38:18.573]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:38:18.653 --> 00:38:19.833]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:38:19.873 --> 00:38:23.934]  And it shows that Nancy Pelosi isn't interested in getting any facts.
[00:38:24.414 --> 00:38:36.097]  She's interested in power and in amassing power and an excuse to keep hold of power, including those thousands of troops who are still at the Capitol, who are still there treating it like an armed camp.
[00:38:36.177 --> 00:38:36.577]  Why?
[00:38:36.997 --> 00:38:37.777]  No one will say.
[00:38:38.257 --> 00:38:39.918]  But this is what Pelosi's interested in.
[00:38:58.894 --> 00:39:04.057]  I mean, shouldn't we be getting a little concerned at this point that the leadership of the U.S.
[00:39:04.097 --> 00:39:07.219]  military should be totally nonpartisan and not involved in these debates?
[00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:09.060]  I mean, are we sure that it still is?
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:27.832]  Yeah, well this is somebody, this particular general, who's been retired now for a while, and I don't question his service to our country at all, Tucker, I applaud him for it, but he has been a dedicated partisan, that's putting it mildly, since he left the military, an extreme left-wing Democrat, and you can just see it in the comments that he's made,
[00:39:28.152 --> 00:39:32.134]  But I'm concerned about what they're laying the groundwork for here, what Nancy Pelosi's doing.
[00:39:32.655 --> 00:39:45.582]  I'm concerned that they continue to treat the January 6th catastrophe, that criminal riot, as an excuse to seize power, to control more power, to step on people's Second Amendment rights, to take away their First Amendment rights.
[00:39:45.882 --> 00:39:48.104]  Now we're hearing about a domestic war on terror?
[00:39:48.624 --> 00:39:49.625]  I mean, what's that going to be?
[00:39:49.645 --> 00:39:55.870]  An excuse to go rifle through the emails and bank statements and personal messages of law-abiding Americans?
[00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.512]  I mean, this is very, very frightening stuff.
[00:39:59.033 --> 00:40:03.256]  And what Pelosi and the Democrats are doing here, trying to consolidate power, it's dangerous.
[00:40:04.137 --> 00:40:08.020]  Please convince your fellow Republicans on the Hill to stand up for the country.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.481]  Please.
[00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:10.162]  I think what you said is absolutely right.
[00:40:10.302 --> 00:40:12.584]  It needed to be said, and I hope others will say it.
[00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:13.685]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:14.306 --> 00:40:15.066]  Senator, good to see you.
[00:40:15.086 --> 00:40:15.647]  Thank you.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.541]  That full video is up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:40:20.601 --> 00:40:21.541]  I suggest you share it.
[00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:22.922]  So let me explain something.
[00:40:23.242 --> 00:40:26.203]  The globalists know there's a worldwide political realignment against them.
[00:40:27.263 --> 00:40:32.685]  They know that their derivatives are in the thousands of trillions and are fake, and they know they're all worse than Bernie Madoff.
[00:40:33.485 --> 00:40:35.026]  They know the world's waking up to that.
[00:40:36.046 --> 00:40:42.928]  And so they fear presidents like Trump or Bolsonaro or others that they can't control, like the one they do control, Boris Johnson,
[00:40:44.346 --> 00:40:44.946]  We're good to go.
[00:41:03.444 --> 00:41:03.704]  Thank you.
[00:41:22.788 --> 00:41:47.951]  Dictatorship, because the doctors can be very authoritarian, they can be very bossy, they can also be downright mad scientists like Joseph Mengele and many others, and Bill Gates and his daughter, who's now a mad scientist as well, she's now joined the political fray, we knew she would, so now she's fair game, and she wears a pink sweater, so seriously, in all the interviews, everything's okay, it's non-threatening, if Hitler would have worn a pink sweater, he'd have won the war, like, we can't fire him, he's wearing a pink sweater, instead of that scary, you know, black uniform, or brown uniform.
[00:41:49.943 --> 00:41:52.065]  We're here, and they really mean business in all of this.
[00:41:52.105 --> 00:41:53.686]  So we'll talk about it more.
[00:41:53.786 --> 00:41:57.028]  Mancow Muller, good longtime friends with Rush Limbaugh for over 30 years.
[00:41:57.669 --> 00:42:05.034]  He's from the same area in Missouri, family, friends, and they also worked together in California and Russia's big break job, so did Mancow.
[00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.535]  They all came out of the same stable.
[00:42:07.396 --> 00:42:10.938]  So that is all coming up on the other side.
[00:42:10.958 --> 00:42:13.821]  Yeah, Mancow's been on radio since he was like 18 years old, so he's kind of like me.
[00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:14.461]  I've been on radio since 21.
[00:42:15.802 --> 00:42:16.943]  We're good to go.
[00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:32.442]  Thank you.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.082]  We saw a big uptick in storable food orders.
[00:42:55.803 --> 00:42:59.888]  A lot of people noticed that the storable food we were cooking on area stay had different packaging.
[00:43:00.448 --> 00:43:04.833]  That's because MyPatriot changed their packaging two years ago to even sturdier bags inside.
[00:43:05.174 --> 00:43:09.118]  So that's why you saw that it's old packaging because that's real storable food.
[00:43:09.618 --> 00:43:13.122]  We have a 10-year supply here in the building for a family.
[00:43:13.743 --> 00:43:16.346]  So a 10-year supply for this many people would be a couple months supply.
[00:43:16.726 --> 00:43:20.030]  I mean, yeah, we got generators, we got some solar panels, we got food.
[00:43:20.411 --> 00:43:26.417]  It still wasn't enough with all the equipment we've got to stay completely live on air, but we stayed on air regardless.
[00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.419]  But I would get your storable food.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.261]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:30.721]  Stay with us.
[00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:35.384]  Eric Mann-Kellmuller, good friends with Rush Limbaugh, will be joining us coming up next segment.
[00:43:57.162 --> 00:44:02.406]  And I just thought, randomly, let's just get the last five minutes of Rush's show and air that.
[00:44:03.006 --> 00:44:05.408]  Right now, the last show he did, I guess that was on February 4th.
[00:44:06.449 --> 00:44:10.091]  And here is the last things that Rush Limbaugh ever said on the radio.
[00:44:10.932 --> 00:44:19.498]  Now, once at the top of the Martian atmosphere, an action-packed seven minutes begins.
[00:44:20.138 --> 00:44:25.682]  That is the time of the descent through the Martian atmosphere to the surface of the planet.
[00:44:27.262 --> 00:44:39.568]  In addition, or as part of this, the temperatures that will reach the surface of the spacecraft will be equivalent to the temperatures on the surface of the sun!
[00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.931]  And it will not melt, if all goes well.
[00:44:45.591 --> 00:44:49.573]  It will not evaporate, it will not vaporize, it will not be destroyed.
[00:44:50.174 --> 00:44:56.577]  It will be able to withstand temperatures equivalent to the surface of the sun.
[00:44:58.283 --> 00:45:01.105]  Then the first supersonic parachute inflation happens.
[00:45:01.386 --> 00:45:06.470]  All of this has to happen on a sequence that controllers will have no control over.
[00:45:08.631 --> 00:45:17.338]  Because of the distance between Mars and Earth, controlling the spacecraft in real time is out of the question.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:27.767]  It takes minutes for a command from NASA on Earth to reach the Perseverance rover.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:43.542]  So, it's up to the spacecraft and the software that's been written to execute numerous tasks at split-second timing.
[00:45:45.563 --> 00:45:50.423]  And it also has to account for any variables that could threaten the descent and landing.
[00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:55.344]  It has to recognize something out of whack and make an adjustment, make an adaption.
[00:45:57.065 --> 00:45:59.165]  Because unlike landing on the moon,
[00:46:00.523 --> 00:46:05.826]  The Moon's close enough, quote-unquote, where we could send alternate landing instructions.
[00:46:06.866 --> 00:46:13.789]  But Mars is so far away that all we can do is sit there and watch for seven minutes.
[00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:24.334]  As this spacecraft plummets, the Martian atmosphere reaches temperatures equivalent to the surface of the Sun.
[00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.376]  Parachutes have to deploy.
[00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:30.814]  It has to land at the exact speed.
[00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.576]  If it doesn't, damage could happen.
[00:46:33.196 --> 00:46:37.680]  The rover could be destroyed at any phase of this landing.
[00:46:37.781 --> 00:46:40.423]  And nobody can stop it if something goes wrong.
[00:46:41.744 --> 00:46:52.775]  Because of how long it takes a command instruction sent from Earth to reach the rover, which at the point in time will be in orbit around Mars.
[00:46:52.835 --> 00:46:53.716]  Now this just
[00:46:55.148 --> 00:47:04.170]  Fascinates me, and I understand these controllers are going to be biting their nails and going nuts during these seven minutes being unable to correct anything.
[00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:13.392]  And for much of the seven minutes, because of the heat generated by re-entry, they won't be able to have any communication with the rover at all.
[00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:18.513]  But even so, whatever communication they get would be delayed because of how far.
[00:47:19.955 --> 00:47:20.516]  Mars is.
[00:47:22.158 --> 00:47:23.920]  Anyway, I gotta take a break.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.961]  I just noticed the clock.
[00:47:24.981 --> 00:47:27.544]  The time be back in just a second.
[00:47:27.704 --> 00:47:30.107]  Well, my friends, that's it.
[00:47:30.388 --> 00:47:34.393]  Yet another excursion into broadcast excellence in the can.
[00:47:35.971 --> 00:47:37.373]  Enjoyed being with you today.
[00:47:37.393 --> 00:47:38.314]  Always do.
[00:47:38.754 --> 00:47:41.357]  And look forward to the next time.
[00:47:41.377 --> 00:47:45.842]  Thanks to Mark Stein, who has been in standby mode all day.
[00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:48.165]  Wasn't sure I was going to be able to go today.
[00:47:48.886 --> 00:47:50.728]  And then each hour I had to assess.
[00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:51.609]  But we made it.
[00:47:51.709 --> 00:47:52.730]  Thank you, Mr. Stein.
[00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.791]  See you all next time.
[00:47:55.558 --> 00:47:57.159]  Well, there you go, boy and voyage.
[00:47:57.199 --> 00:47:58.660]  I couldn't see a way out.
[00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:02.664]  We were completely surrounded, and they all looked like the same person.
[00:48:02.684 --> 00:48:06.166]  Zombies itching to convert us into their weird Hollywood cult.
[00:48:06.427 --> 00:48:11.390]  So again, that is the final moments of the Rush Limbaugh radio program.
[00:48:11.971 --> 00:48:16.634]  And the left wants us to just be depressed about it, but he had a good long live, did a great job.
[00:48:17.495 --> 00:48:21.437]  And I think it's clear to say I wouldn't have this show, we wouldn't have Talk Radio, period.
[00:48:21.457 --> 00:48:25.238]  The Globals would have probably already won if it wasn't for Roger Ailes and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:48:25.258 --> 00:48:26.639]  That's why the left hates them so much.
[00:48:27.039 --> 00:48:28.079]  We should celebrate them.
[00:48:28.099 --> 00:48:30.821]  They weren't perfect men, but they did at least love America.
[00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:31.961]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:38.624]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and of course, Band.Video.
[00:48:38.644 --> 00:48:39.024]  Stay with us.
[00:48:40.565 --> 00:48:42.245]  Bon voyage, Rush Limbaugh.
[00:48:42.265 --> 00:48:43.366]  See you on the other side.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:52.902]  Modern Talk Radio, Fox News, all of it owes to Rush Limbaugh and the vision of Roger Ailes.
[00:48:52.942 --> 00:48:55.583]  If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have put up any fight.
[00:48:56.483 --> 00:49:00.144]  They had to trailblaze when there was no free speech, no broadcast media.
[00:49:00.985 --> 00:49:02.705]  Reagan had gotten rid of the Fairness Doctrine.
[00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:07.387]  They had moved forward, but nobody was challenging it.
[00:49:07.767 --> 00:49:10.468]  Ailes went out, leased the radio stations, put Limbaugh on.
[00:49:10.528 --> 00:49:11.468]  It was a giant hit.
[00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:19.829]  They then got other talk show hosts like Ann Cowell-Muller, who's about to be joining us, longtime friends with, of course, Rush Limbaugh.
[00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:20.970]  Hopefully he'll tell some of the stories here.
[00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.831]  He's a pretty private guy.
[00:49:22.692 --> 00:49:25.354]  And that's why we owe so much to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:49:25.374 --> 00:49:36.443]  30 years of them trying to censor him and take him off the air, and he fought through all of it, then fought through going deaf, fought through, you know, being in an automobile accident, then having back pain, getting addicted to painkillers.
[00:49:36.803 --> 00:49:37.424]  He was a human.
[00:49:37.924 --> 00:49:45.167]  He was pro-war, Mancow criticized him for some of those wars, but he really thought it was the right thing to do, and he loved America and the globalists hated him.
[00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:51.410]  And he sure got more hardcore over the years as it was proven that we were right about this whole globalist program.
[00:49:52.070 --> 00:50:01.815]  And so I thought I'd just play the last 30-40 seconds of his final broadcast from, what was it, February 4th, where he said he'd been so sick that he had to have a backup host.
[00:50:03.005 --> 00:50:27.553]  Uh, February 2nd, he had to have a backup host there the entire time, and so he fought through it like a champ, uh, and through the election, and again, I just salute Rush Limbaugh, and I salute the First Amendment, and I salute his perseverance, and, uh, you know a man by his enemies, and they are celebrating in the streets because they think they've got America down, they think it's another sign of their supremacy, but I smell their defeat in the future.
[00:50:27.913 --> 00:50:30.374]  Here are Rush Limbaugh's final broadcast words.
[00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.181]  My friends, that's it.
[00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:36.563]  Yet another excursion into broadcast excellence in the can.
[00:50:38.083 --> 00:50:39.464]  Enjoyed being with you today.
[00:50:39.484 --> 00:50:40.404]  Always do.
[00:50:40.884 --> 00:50:43.465]  And look forward to the next time.
[00:50:43.485 --> 00:50:47.927]  Thanks to Mark Stein, who has been in standby mode all day.
[00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:50.268]  Wasn't sure I was going to be able to go today.
[00:50:50.968 --> 00:50:52.829]  And then each hour I had to assess.
[00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:53.689]  But we made it.
[00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:54.829]  Thank you, Mr. Stein.
[00:50:55.049 --> 00:50:55.890]  See you all next time.
[00:50:57.213 --> 00:50:57.353]  Let's
[00:51:14.983 --> 00:51:19.866]  And let's just be honest, you had your own fights with Russia, more of a libertarian nationalist populist.
[00:51:19.906 --> 00:51:21.447]  He was more of a Republican Party guy.
[00:51:21.467 --> 00:51:23.249]  He thought that was the most important thing.
[00:51:23.269 --> 00:51:27.832]  And I see that we don't want the neocons to set up a new party to make sure Republicans lose.
[00:51:27.872 --> 00:51:29.132]  We want to take the Republican Party over.
[00:51:29.353 --> 00:51:31.154]  So I think Limbaugh was always right about that.
[00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:33.475]  But we're more of a we the people guy.
[00:51:33.515 --> 00:51:37.818]  He was more of a Republican guy, but he did it out of a place, I think, of thinking it was the right thing to do.
[00:51:37.938 --> 00:51:40.080]  So not to speak ill of the dead.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.882]  Mankal, thank you for joining us from your home.
[00:51:42.922 --> 00:51:44.923]  I know snowed in up in beautiful Chicago.
[00:51:46.344 --> 00:51:49.407]  When wilt thou free the people, O God of mercy, when?
[00:51:50.027 --> 00:51:53.931]  The people, Lord, the people, not crowns and thrones, but men.
[00:51:54.872 --> 00:51:56.893]  These are the arguments I would have with Rush.
[00:51:56.953 --> 00:51:57.594]  I loved Rush.
[00:51:58.795 --> 00:51:59.636]  Two Missouri brothers.
[00:51:59.696 --> 00:52:00.797]  I'm gonna miss that old mule.
[00:52:02.098 --> 00:52:02.818]  He gave me advice.
[00:52:02.858 --> 00:52:04.620]  He was very supportive of me and my career.
[00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:08.683]  There was a few times when he couldn't help me, and he didn't.
[00:52:10.105 --> 00:52:12.647]  It was still business, and he was a competitive guy.
[00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:16.941]  I will tell you the two times, Alex, if you care.
[00:52:17.661 --> 00:52:22.283]  And again, I'm looking at my friend Ron Perlman, who's been on my radio show a lot.
[00:52:22.303 --> 00:52:23.704]  I was on Sons of Anarchy with him.
[00:52:24.845 --> 00:52:27.126]  And he's saying we're going to celebrate in hell with Rush.
[00:52:27.166 --> 00:52:29.947]  And he feels sorry for the devil having to be with Rush in hell.
[00:52:31.788 --> 00:52:33.869]  And it just sickens me what I'm seeing today.
[00:52:33.889 --> 00:52:37.391]  So I hate to bring up any negatives, but we talked about everything yesterday.
[00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:42.314]  And I wonder if you would like to tell me what those arguments were about.
[00:52:43.766 --> 00:52:46.568]  Well, I would like you to tell us about those arguments.
[00:52:46.588 --> 00:52:53.133]  You just told me you had quite a few with Rush, but... Well, no, there was two big ones, and I'll tell you the two big ones.
[00:52:54.394 --> 00:52:57.116]  I felt that, you know, look, we're two kids from Missouri.
[00:52:57.836 --> 00:52:58.717]  I grew up on a dirt road.
[00:52:58.757 --> 00:53:03.480]  My nearest neighbor was a half mile away, and it wasn't a kid a half mile away in Suicide Falls, Missouri.
[00:53:04.261 --> 00:53:09.925]  And I didn't like when Rush was supporting George W. Bush and the big tax increase.
[00:53:11.324 --> 00:53:13.605]  They said no new taxes, or was it the former Bush?
[00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:14.465]  Whichever Bush it was.
[00:53:14.485 --> 00:53:15.566]  It was Bush Senior.
[00:53:15.586 --> 00:53:16.866]  Read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:53:16.906 --> 00:53:18.226]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:19.527]  The big spending people.
[00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:22.848]  And I would say, Rush, you didn't support it with Bill Clinton.
[00:53:23.328 --> 00:53:26.349]  And I had the same argument with him during the Obama administration.
[00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:32.471]  You're against all this big government, but you're okay with all this big government after 9-11.
[00:53:33.652 --> 00:53:36.993]  So these are the kind of things, when I talked to him, that we would argue about.
[00:53:38.093 --> 00:53:39.854]  And I have the same kind of arguments with Sean Hannity.
[00:53:41.396 --> 00:53:45.459]  I've never been a party-first kind of guy, but Rush believed that.
[00:53:45.779 --> 00:53:49.301]  And you also have to think, what were our choices?
[00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:51.823]  What other choice did Rush have?
[00:53:53.143 --> 00:53:56.686]  I guess you dance with the one who brung you, but I've never been a party guy.
[00:53:56.806 --> 00:54:00.528]  Are you going to pick a Libertarian candidate?
[00:54:01.169 --> 00:54:06.392]  I mean, I hosted the Libertarian Convention one year, and what a group of buffoons.
[00:54:07.292 --> 00:54:08.573]  So what do we do, Alex?
[00:54:08.593 --> 00:54:10.914]  You and I, guys like us, yeah, we back outsiders.
[00:54:12.512 --> 00:54:14.434]  Visionaries, but they have no chance in hell of winning.
[00:54:14.494 --> 00:54:16.275]  So Rush was going with the winner, I guess.
[00:54:16.776 --> 00:54:19.278]  Here's the good news.
[00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:24.342]  Trump would never got elected without Rush Limbaugh building the platform.
[00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:30.928]  So you see that our movement to radicalize the Republicans and make them American and take over a party has been somewhat successful.
[00:54:31.128 --> 00:54:33.370]  That's why the left and the globalists are so panicked right now.
[00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.692]  So at the end of the day, Rush was right about
[00:54:36.192 --> 00:54:37.353]  Not breaking up the Republican Party.
[00:54:37.613 --> 00:54:41.676]  Where he was wrong was those damn wars, which we now know were based on lies.
[00:54:41.716 --> 00:54:47.901]  But I also understand the instinct that America's going to war, once we're going to war, you know, because the troops are there, you want to back it.
[00:54:47.921 --> 00:54:49.682]  But I think that's really the black mark on Russia.
[00:54:49.802 --> 00:54:50.683]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:54:50.963 --> 00:54:54.186]  You knew him well, I know a lot of people knew him well, and I've got black marks myself.
[00:54:54.246 --> 00:54:54.766]  I'm not perfect.
[00:54:54.806 --> 00:54:57.188]  The key is, he really believed it was the right thing to do.
[00:54:57.448 --> 00:54:59.530]  He wasn't doing it like Dick Cheney for power and money.
[00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.732]  Let's talk about the Rush Limbaugh you knew when you first met him.
[00:55:03.052 --> 00:55:06.235]  Let's talk about some of your reflections now in hindsight.
[00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:16.002]  Well, you know Alex, the advice I would give any man, and I wonder if you would comment on this, don't ever get your wife a boob job.
[00:55:18.323 --> 00:55:19.824]  Because they want to show everybody.
[00:55:21.766 --> 00:55:22.526]  It ruins marriages.
[00:55:22.566 --> 00:55:25.809]  I've never known a guy who got his wife a boob job and it didn't ruin the marriage.
[00:55:26.716 --> 00:55:27.857]  What am I talking about?
[00:55:27.897 --> 00:55:29.037]  I sound insane, I understand.
[00:55:29.398 --> 00:55:30.899]  Well, it's the fat girl thing.
[00:55:31.759 --> 00:55:34.641]  In fact, I teased him a couple times early on and called him fat girl.
[00:55:36.302 --> 00:55:37.662]  You know, look, we're from Missouri.
[00:55:38.223 --> 00:55:39.524]  The way we teased was brutal.
[00:55:40.044 --> 00:55:41.124]  We were straight talkers.
[00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.046]  And so, you know, he had...
[00:55:44.504 --> 00:55:51.208]  I don't want to overplay this like, you know, the Oliver Stone movie where Nixon's looking at a stake and it's bleeding the blood from Vietnam.
[00:55:51.248 --> 00:55:53.930]  I'm not going to say that, but I think Rush had some insecurities.
[00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:57.812]  And I think he was bold in overcoming his insecurities.
[00:55:57.832 --> 00:55:58.352]  Look at him there.
[00:55:58.712 --> 00:55:59.653]  You know, he got in shape.
[00:55:59.693 --> 00:56:01.034]  He married a hot woman.
[00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:03.270]  Moved down to Florida.
[00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:09.854]  But you know, in the backwoods of Missouri, being a fat boy where we're from, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, he was teased and laughed at.
[00:56:09.894 --> 00:56:14.036]  And of course, all the other radio hosts, they didn't have anything on talent, so they went low.
[00:56:14.716 --> 00:56:15.957]  You know, the Howard Stern types.
[00:56:16.037 --> 00:56:16.958]  And, oh, he's fat.
[00:56:16.978 --> 00:56:17.258]  Look at him.
[00:56:17.278 --> 00:56:17.638]  He's fat.
[00:56:17.658 --> 00:56:18.279]  He's so fat.
[00:56:18.879 --> 00:56:20.400]  But I think it got to him early on.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.582]  And then finally, you know, the guy had so much money and power.
[00:56:23.602 --> 00:56:24.122]  Yeah, I'm fat.
[00:56:25.323 --> 00:56:27.284]  You know, I just have to laugh.
[00:56:27.324 --> 00:56:28.985]  I think about William Shatner.
[00:56:29.941 --> 00:56:34.445]  A friend of mine who was, you know, just a great guy, but he said, you know, I'd rather be a has-been than a never was.
[00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:38.548]  I love all these losers coming out, peeing on Rush's grave today.
[00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:40.029]  What a group of losers.
[00:56:40.709 --> 00:56:42.170]  Hollywood is so bankrupt.
[00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:44.272]  Radio is a leper colony.
[00:56:45.313 --> 00:56:48.415]  And the upper ups at Cumulus Media, they didn't know what to do with Rush.
[00:56:48.435 --> 00:56:49.096]  They didn't agree with him.
[00:56:49.116 --> 00:56:50.216]  They didn't understand the audience.
[00:56:50.457 --> 00:56:51.818]  They don't understand my audience.
[00:56:53.348 --> 00:56:54.889]  They don't understand the people.
[00:56:55.229 --> 00:56:58.130]  They don't understand the pain that's going on out there right now.
[00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.611]  And Rush came from that.
[00:56:59.691 --> 00:57:01.712]  Rush came from the center of America, from the Bible Belt.
[00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:02.572]  He believed in God.
[00:57:03.192 --> 00:57:05.053]  By the way, you talk about America being down and out.
[00:57:05.713 --> 00:57:05.973]  Yeah.
[00:57:06.654 --> 00:57:07.694]  Yeah, there I am with Bill.
[00:57:08.034 --> 00:57:08.374]  Love him.
[00:57:08.514 --> 00:57:08.834]  Love him.
[00:57:08.874 --> 00:57:09.355]  Captain Kirk.
[00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:13.216]  But no, Alex, look, we know things are gonna get bad for a while.
[00:57:13.616 --> 00:57:17.678]  But you and I also know, because we've read the book, that good wins and God wins.
[00:57:18.709 --> 00:57:20.469]  So let them laugh, let them have fun.
[00:57:20.669 --> 00:57:22.490]  They like to cheer and scream in the morning and night.
[00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:23.410]  That's what devils do.
[00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.211]  And in the end, they're going to have to stand before their maker.
[00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:33.612]  And what a bunch of miserable son of a bitches that are crapping on Russia's grave today.
[00:57:33.632 --> 00:57:35.153]  These Hollywood types, turn it off!
[00:57:35.613 --> 00:57:36.833]  Don't support them anymore.
[00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:39.954]  And Ron Perlman, you really are a devil.
[00:57:40.014 --> 00:57:40.834]  He played Hellboy.
[00:57:41.074 --> 00:57:42.234]  He really is the devil.
[00:57:42.634 --> 00:57:45.115]  Oh, Ron Perlman is always threatening to beat my ass.
[00:57:46.499 --> 00:57:48.021]  I mean, these guys are such thugs.
[00:57:48.921 --> 00:57:50.883]  Alex, I hung out with Ron Perlman.
[00:57:51.344 --> 00:57:53.526]  I was on an episode of Sons of Anarchy.
[00:57:53.866 --> 00:57:55.068]  Very famous episode.
[00:57:55.848 --> 00:57:59.592]  And Alex, I know Ron Perlman, and I know you.
[00:58:01.754 --> 00:58:02.615]  You can kick his ass.
[00:58:02.855 --> 00:58:04.557]  I don't even want to touch the disgusting blob.
[00:58:04.697 --> 00:58:05.198]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:06.735 --> 00:58:15.739]  There was a time before I even got into talk radio, and when I was getting into it, 1995, that I knew the household name Mancow.
[00:58:16.219 --> 00:58:19.161]  While he was as big as Howard Stern, they were big enemies.
[00:58:20.128 --> 00:58:22.749]  But you see, Mancow didn't sell the country out.
[00:58:22.909 --> 00:58:25.590]  He, when the Clintons approached him, didn't bow to them.
[00:58:25.651 --> 00:58:30.573]  So then he got cut back to being only the number one talk show host in Chicago and limited syndication.
[00:58:30.613 --> 00:58:31.753]  But that's that's not a failure.
[00:58:32.153 --> 00:58:35.575]  That is a success badge to be censored.
[00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:37.516]  So remember, it was Mancow Mueller.
[00:58:37.656 --> 00:58:38.636]  It was Rush Limbaugh.
[00:58:38.917 --> 00:58:39.417]  These guys
[00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:43.239]  We're, you know, put out by the same folks, syndicated, all that, went through the same stuff.
[00:58:43.719 --> 00:58:47.862]  And so the big question, the crew's asking me, he just said, Hey, I want to get into this without me even bringing it up.
[00:58:48.262 --> 00:58:50.143]  Who's going to replace Rush Limbaugh?
[00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:52.565]  That's the big $64 trillion question.
[00:58:52.585 --> 00:58:55.006]  And I know you've got your ear to the ground.
[00:58:55.026 --> 00:58:59.809]  You know, more people in the industry than probably anybody else out there other than Limbaugh or maybe a Howard Stern.
[00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:04.312]  What is going to happen now to those 650, 700 radio stations?
[00:59:05.372 --> 00:59:06.633]  Let me, let me just say one thing.
[00:59:06.913 --> 00:59:09.075]  It's, uh, I just, do you remember the smoking gun?
[00:59:10.202 --> 00:59:10.422]  Yes.
[00:59:11.263 --> 00:59:12.283]  All the paperwork is there.
[00:59:12.323 --> 00:59:13.624]  You can go look it up yourself.
[00:59:14.164 --> 00:59:16.065]  In every market, I beat Howard Stern.
[00:59:16.965 --> 00:59:21.047]  But see, Howard Stern, as I said yesterday, wore sunglasses and had writers in the other room.
[00:59:21.287 --> 00:59:22.348]  Everything was written down.
[00:59:23.388 --> 00:59:27.530]  When it comes to me and you and Rush, it's from the heart.
[00:59:27.911 --> 00:59:28.691]  It's from the soul.
[00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:32.593]  You can't control a guy like me or you or Rush.
[00:59:34.014 --> 00:59:35.774]  That's why Stern gets promoted.
[00:59:35.794 --> 00:59:38.256]  That's why he gets to be on the satellite and gets $90 million a year.
[00:59:40.037 --> 00:59:41.658]  I would say the same thing about Rogan.
[00:59:42.458 --> 00:59:44.019]  Why did Rogan scrub so much?
[00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:45.600]  For a paycheck.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.861]  My soul is not for sale.
[00:59:49.321 --> 00:59:51.322]  Your soul is not for sale, Alex.
[00:59:52.423 --> 00:59:52.823]  So what?
[00:59:52.883 --> 00:59:54.604]  You inherit the world, but you sell out?
[00:59:56.285 --> 00:59:57.465]  And look, I've never been able to do it.
[00:59:57.485 --> 01:00:00.647]  So instead of $60 million a year, I made $10 million a year.
[01:00:00.687 --> 01:00:01.447]  I'm okay with that.
[01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:03.248]  I sleep very well at night.
[01:00:04.729 --> 01:00:07.330]  And the fact is, Opie, Anthony, and Stern, and all those guys,
[01:00:08.547 --> 01:00:09.467]  We kicked their asses.
[01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:10.488]  Okay, let's move on.
[01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:11.989]  Who's going to replace Rush?
[01:00:12.769 --> 01:00:16.050]  My guy is, and it may make him too dangerous, is Chris Plant.
[01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:18.071]  Have you ever heard of Chris Plant, Alex Jones?
[01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:18.612]  Yes, I have.
[01:00:19.852 --> 01:00:20.913]  I think he's pretty damn good.
[01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:25.054]  Which means they won't, Cumulus won't hire him.
[01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:26.895]  Because he's good.
[01:00:27.596 --> 01:00:30.297]  So you have to think, what will radio do that's really stupid?
[01:00:30.537 --> 01:00:32.758]  And I was talking, I talked to three people today from Cumulus.
[01:00:33.641 --> 01:00:35.942]  Which, you know, hosts Rush Show.
[01:00:36.582 --> 01:00:39.063]  I don't know, they may do something boring like Mark Stein.
[01:00:40.023 --> 01:00:41.324]  They may move up Levin.
[01:00:41.364 --> 01:00:45.125]  Levin, who is... Look, I like these guys, but they're boring!
[01:00:45.345 --> 01:00:45.945]  They're boring.
[01:00:46.305 --> 01:00:46.726]  Sorry.
[01:00:48.426 --> 01:00:49.266]  Sitting in a library.
[01:00:49.286 --> 01:00:50.307]  You've seen that show.
[01:00:50.407 --> 01:00:52.568]  But what they like is it's safe.
[01:00:52.668 --> 01:00:57.689]  I mean, you talk about the New World Order, you talk about the microchip, the Mark of the Beast, the globalist, the big issue.
[01:00:57.969 --> 01:01:00.610]  It's that final piece that you're not allowed to talk about.
[01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:02.091]  It's...
[01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:03.748]  It's so true.
[01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:13.816]  And I reflect on, you know, some of our close friends that went before us, Malachi Martin and Jim Mars, and you know, connect the dots, la la la la la, Pee Wee Herman, right?
[01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:17.880]  You connect the dots, and well what, okay, so what does it all mean?
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.381]  What's the bottom line?
[01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:25.206]  And you and I know, and we tell them, oh, mm, ugh, can't do that.
[01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.731]  So you have to make everything an enigma.
[01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:29.332]  You can't really say anything.
[01:01:30.593 --> 01:01:35.897]  You know, and I think another possible replacement, and again, to me, he's a deep state scripted guy.
[01:01:36.137 --> 01:01:39.880]  My opinion, deep state scripted, very controllable.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.421]  He reads from a script.
[01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:44.508]  Oh yeah, Ben Shapiro!
[01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:58.239]  Oh they've definitely, I mean, they took, of course, a mutual friend of ours, Michael Savage, off of those stations to give that guy, and I'm not against people's success, but he was given, given all those stations, and here's the problem.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.181]  Cumulus, Premier, Clear Channel, all those different conglomerates have been involved with Rush over the years.
[01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:12.763]  Rush was so good and such an icon that stations wanted him so then they could make them carry all the other programs that were boring.
[01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:22.105]  If they don't put somebody badass in there and populist in there, then it's not going to hold the audience and they're going to lose those stations, which is really the plan.
[01:02:22.145 --> 01:02:23.746]  They've been divesting out of the stations.
[01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:25.346]  They've been buying up the stations.
[01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:28.067]  They put weird, you know, leftist garbage on it.
[01:02:28.107 --> 01:02:28.787]  Don't do that!
[01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:30.542]  Don't do that!
[01:02:32.243 --> 01:02:33.084]  You can't do that!
[01:02:37.047 --> 01:02:38.689]  You can't reveal the truth like that!
[01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:42.412]  I'm here to tell you, Alex, you're right!
[01:02:43.152 --> 01:02:44.694]  It's exactly what they're gonna do.
[01:02:47.256 --> 01:02:50.859]  Folks, what I said yesterday, location, location, location, you and I were joking.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.321]  Agenda, agenda, agenda!
[01:02:54.682 --> 01:02:55.863]  You sit there at home.
[01:02:56.324 --> 01:02:57.405]  Well, they wouldn't do that!
[01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:00.387]  They wouldn't do that, of course!
[01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:02.308]  Of course!
[01:03:03.608 --> 01:03:05.809]  They want their station to be successful.
[01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:08.570]  Cumulus wouldn't tank their stations!
[01:03:09.371 --> 01:03:10.811]  They want to make money!
[01:03:11.532 --> 01:03:22.697]  I'm here to tell you, with a group of investors, and this is a big story, Tony Tomaska, Mike Fowler is our lead-in, and other billionaires in Chicago, with me!
[01:03:23.854 --> 01:03:25.216]  They want to get rid of WLS.
[01:03:25.436 --> 01:03:26.217]  I wanted to buy it.
[01:03:26.297 --> 01:03:27.038]  I could have saved it.
[01:03:27.479 --> 01:03:29.262]  I'm talking like a month ago, Alex.
[01:03:33.183 --> 01:03:34.383]  Well, let's explain what's happening.
[01:03:34.403 --> 01:03:37.944]  They want a monopoly, so big megabanks have unlimited trillions in fake currency.
[01:03:38.264 --> 01:03:40.425]  So we look at multi-billion dollar industries and free speech.
[01:03:40.865 --> 01:03:45.026]  The system sees it as a place for media to organize, for local talent.
[01:03:45.346 --> 01:03:53.068]  As big tech censors everything, there's going to be incredible hunger for radio and TV stations to build real, true stuff around populism.
[01:03:53.548 --> 01:03:55.648]  They can then direct sell products, get sponsors.
[01:03:55.928 --> 01:03:56.949]  The globalists don't want that.
[01:03:57.009 --> 01:03:57.849]  They want a monopoly.
[01:03:58.129 --> 01:04:00.171]  Alex, what you're saying is a God's honest truth.
[01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.851]  I've lived this.
[01:04:27.891 --> 01:04:28.952]  I was their quarterback.
[01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:30.874]  I know all the players.
[01:04:32.656 --> 01:04:34.318]  Do you understand how crazy it is?
[01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.221]  But this is what people went through against the Nazis.
[01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:40.926]  This is what people went through in Russia and Cuba and everywhere else.
[01:04:41.966 --> 01:04:45.067]  I'm telling you that the people in charge don't care about the bottom line.
[01:04:45.607 --> 01:04:47.268]  They don't give two shiznits about the listener.
[01:04:47.288 --> 01:04:47.868]  They care about power.
[01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.449]  That's why they're willing to kill the dollar.
[01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:50.749]  That's why they're willing to kill the border.
[01:04:50.909 --> 01:04:52.810]  That's why they're willing to shut the power plants off.
[01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:56.551]  That's why they're willing to wreck everything because that's their plan to consolidate it.
[01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:57.952]  In a war, you wreck stuff.
[01:04:58.192 --> 01:04:59.712]  And we're under globalist attack.
[01:05:01.053 --> 01:05:02.373]  They're big money friends.
[01:05:04.194 --> 01:05:09.355]  They don't want a great radio station or radio stations that have a guy like Rush or you or me or anyone else.
[01:05:09.556 --> 01:05:10.496]  They don't want populism.
[01:05:11.673 --> 01:05:12.253]  I mean, my God.
[01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:16.195]  But it was so popular they couldn't get rid of Rush because he still kept all the stations.
[01:05:16.516 --> 01:05:22.639]  That's why I predict there's... I predict... I predict there's nobody but a hardcore populist that could take over that slot.
[01:05:23.339 --> 01:05:24.300]  And that's what the people want.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.880]  Now, see, there you go.
[01:05:26.441 --> 01:05:27.221]  There you go again.
[01:05:28.002 --> 01:05:28.462]  Thinking.
[01:05:29.903 --> 01:05:30.923]  It doesn't work in radio.
[01:05:32.404 --> 01:05:33.464]  Go up and down on the dial.
[01:05:33.504 --> 01:05:33.865]  Listen to it.
[01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.959]  It's by design.
[01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:47.844]  Listen, we always get on these little stations and within a year we have great ratings or the top ratings and then always ESPN comes in and buys the slot I'm in and just puts sports on.
[01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:48.864]  And that's the word, right?
[01:05:48.884 --> 01:05:51.305]  They're thinking about just replacing Rush with sports entirely.
[01:05:52.106 --> 01:05:55.407]  That is what I heard from one of my best contacts in the company.
[01:05:56.668 --> 01:05:57.869]  You know, I worked there for many years.
[01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.151]  This one guy swears they're going to go sports.
[01:06:04.212 --> 01:06:04.612]  Good luck!
[01:06:05.723 --> 01:06:09.504]  So, you know, they don't care about silencing their voices, and I don't think you should care about them.
[01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:12.424]  Look, the only thing we have is our vote.
[01:06:12.484 --> 01:06:14.225]  Our vote is fixed now, right?
[01:06:14.245 --> 01:06:15.405]  The only thing we have is our vote.
[01:06:15.585 --> 01:06:15.765]  No.
[01:06:16.185 --> 01:06:19.406]  The only thing we have is our money, and our time, and our life, and our soul.
[01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:21.286]  And I say this to you, folks.
[01:06:21.906 --> 01:06:24.667]  Don't give them your soul, don't give them your heart, don't give them your time.
[01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:27.127]  Absolutely.
[01:06:27.147 --> 01:06:27.767]  Hack them!
[01:06:28.327 --> 01:06:28.927]  Flee from them!
[01:06:29.787 --> 01:06:30.968]  Absolutely, it's important.
[01:06:31.308 --> 01:06:32.308]  Let's talk about
[01:06:33.584 --> 01:06:43.063]  Trump, how he's going to fight back, and I've got word he is, what Obama's third administration is now doing, going after the guns, I said that on purpose, the third Obama administration.
[01:06:43.885 --> 01:06:44.425]  Welcome back.
[01:06:44.685 --> 01:06:47.786]  Mancow is our guest, longtime syndicated host.
[01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:51.546]  Back in the day, syndicated with Rush Limbaugh, right out of the same building, good friends.
[01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:57.827]  And I don't tell this Trump story, Limbaugh story that cool, because I mean, to me, I don't want to be associated with the establishment at all.
[01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.848]  Hollywood, the big syndicators, any of it.
[01:07:00.248 --> 01:07:04.809]  And some of my meetings with the big syndicators over the years, I've never talked about because they were off the record meetings.
[01:07:04.889 --> 01:07:10.670]  But Roger Ailes did reach out to me several times, want me to come to pilot shows with Fox.
[01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:12.510]  And I never did it.
[01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:13.833]  I don't
[01:07:30.678 --> 01:07:36.103]  Like a New York Times article years after that said, Jones begged to be on Fox, but Fox didn't want him.
[01:07:36.463 --> 01:07:42.288]  So there was also the butt-hurtness of them saying that, again, I wanted to be with them.
[01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.530]  And of course, Mancow didn't mince words on his show.
[01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:49.154]  It was very popular, got good ratings, but they didn't end up giving him a full-time show as well.
[01:07:49.174 --> 01:07:51.396]  So I think I was smart not to do that.
[01:07:51.436 --> 01:07:54.138]  But that's a true story, and he can speak to that in just a moment.
[01:07:54.298 --> 01:07:54.759]  But first,
[01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:59.601]  Trump, every time I've talked to Trump, almost, except the time he called my wife to congratulate her when we got married.
[01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:00.961]  It was randomly, it was crazy.
[01:08:01.341 --> 01:08:02.702]  Here's the president, it was Trump.
[01:08:03.882 --> 01:08:07.564]  He's literally like, I love Rush Limbaugh, don't you love Rush Limbaugh?
[01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:08.464]  Yeah, I like Rush Limbaugh.
[01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.225]  Well, you know, I hear when he retires or whatever, you're going to take his slot.
[01:08:11.245 --> 01:08:11.785]  That's what I hear.
[01:08:11.805 --> 01:08:13.046]  I hear you're the heir to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:08:13.406 --> 01:08:16.867]  I'm like, well, I kind of have bigger audiences than he ever had online, but he's a trailblazer.
[01:08:18.948 --> 01:08:28.633]  Obviously, InfoWars, what I do politically, would be, I'm in that slot, I never wanted to be in that slot, GCN, 24 years ago said, the slot we have is during this, nobody wants it up against Rush Limbaugh.
[01:08:28.953 --> 01:08:33.475]  And I said, great, I'll do it, and you know, we've been very successful, hundreds of radio stations, most of them mom and pop, but they're great.
[01:08:33.835 --> 01:08:40.099]  So there's my two tie-ins, but you can vouch for that, that Fox wanted me, man, Cal, and I didn't want Fox, correct?
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:43.700]  I don't know.
[01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.742]  Well did I come and do the pilot show with you?
[01:08:49.735 --> 01:08:50.936]  A little bit now, Alex, a little bit.
[01:08:52.536 --> 01:08:56.258]  I had to beg you to get you to come on the show.
[01:08:56.438 --> 01:08:58.679]  You were done with Fox.
[01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:00.640]  I don't know what went before that.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:07.923]  But by the time I got my TV show, you didn't like the way they were going.
[01:09:08.663 --> 01:09:10.144]  So I don't know what had happened years before that.
[01:09:10.164 --> 01:09:14.566]  I will tell you, Roger Ailes, what a hit job they've done on him, what a hit job they're doing on Rush today.
[01:09:14.826 --> 01:09:16.687]  I don't think Ailes was a trailblazer and a great guy.
[01:09:16.727 --> 01:09:18.508]  I'm just saying, I knew Fox wouldn't let me be me.
[01:09:18.568 --> 01:09:18.848]  That's all.
[01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:19.088]  I'm sorry.
[01:09:19.659 --> 01:09:20.800]  No, no, no, I think you're right.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:30.127]  And listen, I had a show that you were part of, and Aisha Tyler, and half the women that ended up being on The View, through a guy named Woody Frazier.
[01:09:31.788 --> 01:09:33.849]  We had on Breitbart, please.
[01:09:35.711 --> 01:09:37.272]  The family doesn't appreciate this.
[01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:45.678]  Right after I talked to his father-in-law, Orson Bean, who he loved, Orson Bean got run over, mysteriously.
[01:09:46.647 --> 01:09:51.891]  Right after I talked with him about what I believe, and that is that Andrew Breitbart was murdered.
[01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.113]  This is a personal statement of mine.
[01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:56.475]  But I spoke with Breitbart a lot.
[01:09:56.495 --> 01:09:59.397]  But imagine that, Alex Jones, Mancow, Breitbart, it was all there.
[01:10:00.898 --> 01:10:05.802]  And now you talk about kids being born, my daughters were being born, and whatever, I went away.
[01:10:06.843 --> 01:10:15.790]  And I came back and I turned on the Beck, I can't remember his name, Glenn Beck, who had a Christ complex, right?
[01:10:17.074 --> 01:10:18.534]  And I know it's mine.
[01:10:18.554 --> 01:10:19.315]  I know it's original.
[01:10:19.855 --> 01:10:25.396]  And this guy I worked on with Philadelphia, from Philadelphia TV, who created the term, If It Bleeds, It Leads.
[01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:28.097]  This guy had been working with me on this show.
[01:10:29.617 --> 01:10:32.277]  And we had all these ideas.
[01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:38.539]  And I, boy, I tell you, almost verbatim, a lot of, I mean, it could be quips in this, but a lot of them ended up being the Glenn Beck Show.
[01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:47.456]  Oh, Glenn Beck on record, I had his own employees tell me, he had four people, five people that watched me all the time, and they would just take it, because he's an actor.
[01:10:47.536 --> 01:10:48.717]  So he was stealing from everybody.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:49.560]  Yeah.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.542]  Yeah, you know, that is the thing too, man.
[01:10:53.142 --> 01:10:54.563]  So many of these guys, you're the real deal.
[01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.805]  People don't understand your incredible sense of humor.
[01:10:57.105 --> 01:10:58.966]  It really bothers me when people talk to me about you.
[01:10:59.366 --> 01:11:01.408]  They don't get that he's having fun.
[01:11:02.028 --> 01:11:02.989]  He's having fun.
[01:11:03.029 --> 01:11:05.470]  He can't sit there all day every day and be miserable.
[01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:06.771]  Let them do that.
[01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:07.572]  Let the left do that.
[01:11:07.612 --> 01:11:11.094]  Let these people that are bashing Rush and dancing on his corpse, let them be miserable.
[01:11:11.374 --> 01:11:12.555]  Alex Jones is a happy guy.
[01:11:12.595 --> 01:11:15.577]  Why do you think, I mean, Trump really loved Limbaugh.
[01:11:15.597 --> 01:11:17.458]  I mean, he wouldn't stop talking about him all the time.
[01:11:17.478 --> 01:11:18.239]  What was going on there?
[01:11:19.079 --> 01:11:23.002]  I want to tell you that probably the most recent conversation I had with Trump, and I don't know what it was.
[01:11:23.683 --> 01:11:24.163]  Can you see that?
[01:11:24.203 --> 01:11:24.684]  Is that great?
[01:11:24.704 --> 01:11:27.906]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:33.831]  Anyway, no, he was, he was singing praises of you and me and Tucker.
[01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:36.714]  We didn't get into Rush, but I think he had just given Rush the award.
[01:11:36.754 --> 01:11:44.260]  So, I mean, his, his, his love of Rush was obvious, but he also was, he, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.863]  I know that he really thought that Tucker Carlson was smart.
[01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:53.158]  And it really bothered him when Tucker didn't go his way.
[01:11:54.679 --> 01:11:55.239]  That I know.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.321]  I mean, Trump really is a big ol' sweetie pie in the real world.
[01:12:01.341 --> 01:12:03.541]  I know you know him a lot better than I do, but I know people that know him very well.
[01:12:03.821 --> 01:12:05.102]  He is just a great guy.
[01:12:05.842 --> 01:12:09.703]  Well, look, he got me into a restaurant called Ray O's in New York that's impossible to get into.
[01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:12.084]  We went to a Duran Duran concert.
[01:12:13.183 --> 01:12:14.225]  Red Carpet Massacre.
[01:12:14.425 --> 01:12:16.048]  Duran Duran and Trump.
[01:12:16.508 --> 01:12:17.670]  You know, this is a family guy.
[01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:18.331]  He's a real guy.
[01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:19.754]  What did we hear our whole lives?
[01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:21.316]  What did you and I hear?
[01:12:21.356 --> 01:12:23.740]  What did we... I would say, we don't need any more politicians.
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.202]  We don't need any more lawyers.
[01:12:26.078 --> 01:12:27.799]  So we finally got a businessman in.
[01:12:27.839 --> 01:12:31.620]  You know, look, our gas prices are at $3 here.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.661]  They were under $2 with Trump.
[01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:35.961]  My 401k has crashed.
[01:12:36.782 --> 01:12:38.582]  What are we in, two or three wars right now?
[01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:42.244]  Medicine is skyrocketing, but at least Trump isn't tweeting.
[01:12:42.904 --> 01:12:44.084]  At least Trump's not tweeting.
[01:12:44.304 --> 01:12:45.505]  So everything's okay.
[01:12:46.245 --> 01:12:48.286]  And we got President Kamala in there for my daughters.
[01:12:49.026 --> 01:12:50.206]  Oh, I love the media.
[01:12:50.246 --> 01:12:51.327]  We should respect Kamala.
[01:12:51.547 --> 01:12:52.627]  Isn't she a role model?
[01:12:53.047 --> 01:12:54.708]  Nah, I don't really want my daughters to be dirty whores.
[01:12:56.533 --> 01:12:58.254]  The cackle like the Wicked Witch of the East.
[01:12:58.914 --> 01:12:59.115]  Yeah.
[01:12:59.495 --> 01:13:01.856]  Hey, I got some people texting me.
[01:13:02.056 --> 01:13:03.637]  I would hate if you did this to me.
[01:13:03.657 --> 01:13:04.958]  Can I do something horrible here?
[01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:07.920]  I want to say hi to Billy Corgett from the Smashing Pumpkins.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.841]  Roger Stone is watching us right now.
[01:13:10.181 --> 01:13:14.183]  Robert Fleischman, the original lead singer of Journey, wrote Wheel in the Sky and Adam the Magician.
[01:13:14.203 --> 01:13:15.344]  I'm just looking at all these people.
[01:13:16.285 --> 01:13:17.685]  Man, everybody's watching us right now.
[01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.967]  I don't get this kind of feedback when I do other shows.
[01:13:20.387 --> 01:13:22.168]  Man, Cal, but those are all your buddies.
[01:13:22.308 --> 01:13:24.990]  I think you introduced them all to me, but Roger Stone, so.
[01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:26.611]  Want to say hi to all those folks.
[01:13:26.931 --> 01:13:28.853]  And boy, are they going after that guy.
[01:13:29.033 --> 01:13:29.693]  Boy, is that all fake.
[01:13:29.713 --> 01:13:31.755]  Yeah, people are like, where's Roger?
[01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:34.577]  He obviously doesn't want it out, but they are harassing the living snot out of him.
[01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:37.959]  The same thing with you.
[01:13:37.999 --> 01:13:38.759]  They tried to send you.
[01:13:38.779 --> 01:13:39.440]  I don't want to get into it.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.942]  I don't want to be called into court, but all of this is so fake.
[01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:43.943]  It's such a setup.
[01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:47.986]  It's such a deep state hit on you guys, and it makes me sick.
[01:13:49.989 --> 01:13:50.709]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:13:50.749 --> 01:13:53.370]  What do you think they're going to do as Trump begins to re-emerge?
[01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:54.891]  I actually like doing the shout-outs.
[01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:55.551]  I love all those guys.
[01:13:57.032 --> 01:14:07.597]  What are they going to do as the borders open and they triple the drug prices and the power's going off and everything's collapsing and they're calling everyone racist and saying America sucks?
[01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:08.837]  I mean, this sucks!
[01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:09.978]  The Democrats suck!
[01:14:12.019 --> 01:14:15.861]  Alex, a source told me that on December 21st,
[01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.090]  I was told the same thing.
[01:14:41.638 --> 01:14:44.021]  This is, well, this is pretty big news that nobody's talked about.
[01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:47.285]  So the 21st, and there's been many attempts that we don't know about.
[01:14:47.966 --> 01:14:51.690]  But my understanding is we got very close to him and they said, look, you're too hot.
[01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.712]  We can't protect you anymore.
[01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:57.337]  Basically, the deep state said, shut up, go away, or you're dead and your family's dead.
[01:14:58.337 --> 01:15:01.220]  I don't think we're going to see, um, well, I don't know.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.103]  I think I'm already wrong because I didn't think we would see a return of Trump.
[01:15:04.444 --> 01:15:07.547]  And then he showed up at that presidential, uh, the President's Day event.
[01:15:07.827 --> 01:15:09.069]  So I didn't think we'd see him again.
[01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:09.609]  Okay.
[01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:11.672]  I've been asked not to say what you just said.
[01:15:12.272 --> 01:15:14.775]  So now that you've said it, I'm going to go ahead and bring all this out on the other side.
[01:15:14.995 --> 01:15:17.838]  Well, I want to say that's what someone told me.
[01:15:18.689 --> 01:15:19.790]  Okay, I've heard lots of crazy stuff.
[01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:24.453]  Well, let me just tell you that you know they already beat up- This is a very good source, but I'm not going on the record today.
[01:15:24.473 --> 01:15:30.358]  Well, part of the message was they beat up Stone's wife in front of her house, put her in the hospital, and then I wasn't even supposed to talk about it until later.
[01:15:30.378 --> 01:15:31.559]  People thought it happened like three days later.
[01:15:31.599 --> 01:15:32.219]  No, it happened before.
[01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:37.943]  And I was told all this by lawyers in the White House of the assassination attempts, of the threats.
[01:15:38.063 --> 01:15:43.608]  Trump was totally surrounded, and I'm on air telling people, and the Q folks are like, shut up, Jones, we're invincible.
[01:15:44.048 --> 01:15:46.310]  And I'm like, no, no, we're not invincible.
[01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:47.551]  He's totally surrounded.
[01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:48.971]  God Almighty!
[01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:50.251]  And we walked right into the trap.
[01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:50.832]  Okay, Alex.
[01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:54.452]  Alex, oh, I got something big to tell you from inside the White House.
[01:15:55.172 --> 01:15:56.653]  Well, I know you're hooked into everything.
[01:15:56.693 --> 01:15:58.393]  Mancow, Eric Mancow Muller is here.
[01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.273]  Follow him on Instagram.
[01:15:59.753 --> 01:16:00.574]  You may not like it.
[01:16:01.794 --> 01:16:03.334]  All right, well, I want to hear it when we come back.
[01:16:04.194 --> 01:16:08.155]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the websites for now.
[01:16:08.495 --> 01:16:09.295]  And Bandai Video.
[01:16:10.796 --> 01:16:11.596]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:16:12.639 --> 01:16:13.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:17.682]  All I've been is persecuted for supporting President Trump the last six years.
[01:16:18.342 --> 01:16:19.122]  And he is the president.
[01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:20.363]  He didn't get re-elected in a landslide.
[01:16:20.383 --> 01:16:21.224]  All the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:16:21.624 --> 01:16:23.505]  And I know Mancow only got persecuted for it.
[01:16:24.344 --> 01:16:28.208]  So a lot of people are like, oh, you're only supporting Trump because, you know, it's so great for you.
[01:16:28.289 --> 01:16:34.395]  Oh, yeah, it's really wonderful to have all these attacks take place and to be deplatformed and take my bank accounts away.
[01:16:34.415 --> 01:16:36.618]  So I don't know what Mancow is about to get into.
[01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.039]  I know that he is friends with Trump.
[01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:39.881]  I know they reportedly people come and talk quite a bit.
[01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.486]  I've got all the same info from some other people that talk to Trump quite a bit.
[01:16:46.215 --> 01:17:11.193]  Again, I've missed calls from the President, but I don't know what this piece of intel is, but recap, because we hit the break, about what you were told by a White House source about a very serious assassination attempt on December 21st of last year, when you noticed Trump suddenly got really, really quiet, he went ahead and capitulated, and, you know, until he decided, I guess, to roar back on the 6th, and then they were able to basically sabotage that.
[01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:12.894]  What was your other big piece of news?
[01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:21.742]  It's really dangerous, bud.
[01:17:24.464 --> 01:17:26.645]  I know you were one of the last guys to talk to Breitbart.
[01:17:26.805 --> 01:17:27.925]  I know you know he was really killed.
[01:17:27.945 --> 01:17:28.905]  There's a message to other people.
[01:17:29.106 --> 01:17:29.586]  What's the news?
[01:17:30.526 --> 01:17:34.128]  I was probably... I may have been the last person to talk to him.
[01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:37.029]  Because Breitbart had some information.
[01:17:37.929 --> 01:17:40.250]  And I think it was pedophile, satanic stuff.
[01:17:40.971 --> 01:17:41.491]  My opinion.
[01:17:41.671 --> 01:17:42.371]  Well, he tweeted that.
[01:17:42.451 --> 01:17:43.812]  He tweeted that right before he died.
[01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.072]  On the Obamas and Clintons.
[01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:48.714]  But I think he had video that was going to ruin everything.
[01:17:49.802 --> 01:17:50.643]  And I believe he was murdered.
[01:17:51.304 --> 01:17:53.065]  Or he went jogging at 2.30 in the morning.
[01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:54.266]  No, they poisoned his wine.
[01:17:56.848 --> 01:18:00.892]  I want to tell you that a very good source of mine, there he is, God that I love him.
[01:18:01.972 --> 01:18:08.578]  If you don't know who he is, he created Arianna Huffington, in my opinion, and really created a lot of what we see on the internet now.
[01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:13.142]  There's another trailblazer, just like Rush, that we lost, and they were dancing on his grave too.
[01:18:14.836 --> 01:18:16.457]  Um, look, I want honesty.
[01:18:16.537 --> 01:18:18.697]  I want, uh, and that's what Breitbart and Rush wanted.
[01:18:18.717 --> 01:18:22.239]  They, for the most part, truth, truth, forget party, truth.
[01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:35.143]  Alex, I want to tell you from my very good source that, and you talked about the devil earlier, the devil, you know, the devil knows you're, the devil knows you're here.
[01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:37.584]  The devil knows I'm here.
[01:18:39.369 --> 01:18:43.293]  And I want to say to all those that aren't facing any challenges, nobody cares about you.
[01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.054]  The devil doesn't care about you.
[01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:59.208]  If Alex Jones was sitting at home right now, drinking a six-pack, he wouldn't have any problems, nor would I. But the minute you step out and try to do good and step up for God, then the devils come out.
[01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.210]  New levels, new devils.
[01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:04.553]  So I'm going to tell you something you've probably heard.
[01:19:06.223 --> 01:19:08.164]  But they were counting on- I really don't want to go here.
[01:19:08.584 --> 01:19:09.524]  Just say it.
[01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:10.604]  Okay.
[01:19:11.465 --> 01:19:12.485]  They were counting on you.
[01:19:12.505 --> 01:19:17.627]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:18.007 --> 01:19:19.027]  Let me say this.
[01:19:19.227 --> 01:19:21.088]  No, I know you're not a BS-er, so tell me.
[01:19:21.148 --> 01:19:22.588]  I want to know if it's about me especially.
[01:19:24.549 --> 01:19:29.210]  Very smart of you, and they didn't expect it, that you said, stop!
[01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:30.511]  No violence!
[01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:31.791]  We're loves!
[01:19:31.871 --> 01:19:32.992]  This is about peace and love!
[01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:33.932]  Stop it!
[01:19:35.461 --> 01:19:41.843]  And when you did that, from my sources, the deep state went, we had him!
[01:19:42.523 --> 01:19:44.784]  They thought they had you, Alex.
[01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:46.185]  You were done.
[01:19:47.045 --> 01:19:49.066]  You were set up, in my opinion.
[01:19:50.986 --> 01:20:00.930]  And I know, from my sources, that when you told everybody, stop, step down, this is about love, and thankfully somebody filmed it, you saved your ass.
[01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.671]  You saved InfoWar, and the movement can continue.
[01:20:04.457 --> 01:20:05.878]  But boy, man, what a setup!
[01:20:05.918 --> 01:20:06.799]  What a fake deal!
[01:20:06.999 --> 01:20:09.061]  What a fake operation that whole deal was!
[01:20:09.281 --> 01:20:17.588]  We know the President now was set up by, not the Secret Service, they're mostly good, but by insiders in the party that told him there was security and a stage.
[01:20:17.628 --> 01:20:19.289]  The stage was set up the night before.
[01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.331]  We got there and they'd removed the stage.
[01:20:21.791 --> 01:20:23.052]  I mean, we were totally set up.
[01:20:25.935 --> 01:20:38.227]  Let me tell you this, notice when they dropped the entire thing last Saturday unexpectedly without witnesses a week early in the trial of Trump, the second impeachment farce, was when Lindsey Graham said, what did Pelosi know, when did she know it?
[01:20:38.247 --> 01:20:40.429]  Now we knew that day one, they ordered the police to stand down.
[01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:43.470]  Honore and this globalist general tried to blame the police.
[01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:45.131]  They were just ordered to go do traffic control.
[01:20:45.491 --> 01:20:53.155]  So that's starting to come out that CNN paid the Antifa people, that they helped trigger a small number of the group going in.
[01:20:53.535 --> 01:20:56.716]  And so that's why they ended the trial because Trump was getting ready to bring that out.
[01:20:57.657 --> 01:20:59.117]  Antifa is our modern brown shirt.
[01:20:59.698 --> 01:21:03.019]  Alex, listen, we should have done this on air.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:06.421]  What do you think?
[01:21:06.961 --> 01:21:08.582]  What are you thinking about what I just told you?
[01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:11.499]  Well, I mean, I knew that they were... Well, here's the deal.
[01:21:11.819 --> 01:21:14.081]  They told me, the Secret Service, Trump wants you to lead the deal.
[01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:15.942]  He's going to announce that he'll meet you there.
[01:21:15.962 --> 01:21:18.284]  But was that true?
[01:21:18.304 --> 01:21:19.184]  Trump wants you to do that?
[01:21:19.224 --> 01:21:19.785]  No, no, no, no.
[01:21:19.825 --> 01:21:21.846]  Trump then looked at me and said, I'm going to be in the march.
[01:21:21.886 --> 01:21:23.047]  I was right there in the second row.
[01:21:23.067 --> 01:21:24.368]  He looked right at me, goes, I'm going to lead the march.
[01:21:24.528 --> 01:21:26.489]  And then the Secret Service was there with the people.
[01:21:26.529 --> 01:21:27.270]  They were waving at me.
[01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:29.951]  They came over and waved me over and let me out to go lead the crowd.
[01:21:30.112 --> 01:21:32.153]  It was all... But it wasn't Trump.
[01:21:32.933 --> 01:21:36.076]  It was the insiders that told Trump there was a stage and security.
[01:21:36.556 --> 01:21:39.498]  And then the Secret Service stood down and was going to let him go there alone.
[01:21:39.838 --> 01:21:43.380]  Basically, and all of this, it was all, Trump was totally set up.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.421]  That's why they started the rioting in the middle of his speech.
[01:21:46.542 --> 01:21:54.946]  The minute he said, I'll meet you at the Capitol, all the guys on earpieces got go messages and they believe they were being commanded by Trump.
[01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:57.467]  They're really being commanded by the Democrats in deep state.
[01:21:57.867 --> 01:21:59.408]  And that's how they use the Q op to do it.
[01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.510]  Is that not sophisticated mind control?
[01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:08.892]  Yeah, brother, I want to pick your brain on a future show about Q. I'd like to figure that whole thing out.
[01:22:09.613 --> 01:22:13.214]  You know, a lot of people thought I was Q. I don't know if you knew that.
[01:22:13.354 --> 01:22:23.118]  And then, you know, going back to the 21st, as I said, my December of last year, and the attempt that got close to killing Trump, according to what I've heard, the assassination attempt that came close.
[01:22:24.019 --> 01:22:27.360]  And then Jared got to take over the pardons and that whole thing was a mess.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.862]  But my sources are also telling me that Jared got very, very rich.
[01:22:34.665 --> 01:22:37.727]  Yeah, I don't know what to think of all of that.
[01:22:37.767 --> 01:22:41.989]  And yeah, a lot of the people close to Trump, as you said, he was too kind.
[01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:44.891]  Everybody thinks he's such a hard ass and everything.
[01:22:44.931 --> 01:22:45.911]  I think he was too kind.
[01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:50.174]  Yeah, the whole you're fired deal, he's very savvy and smart and good.
[01:22:50.214 --> 01:22:50.994]  He can do what he wants.
[01:22:51.394 --> 01:22:52.795]  He's a good businessman, a good PR guy.
[01:22:52.815 --> 01:22:55.877]  But the guy you see that says you're fired, the apprentice, that's not Trump.
[01:22:57.352 --> 01:22:57.532]  No.
[01:22:58.213 --> 01:22:59.073]  No, it's a TV show.
[01:22:59.714 --> 01:23:00.474]  It's a TV show.
[01:23:01.195 --> 01:23:08.500]  Well, Mankow, listen, you're always hard to get on, but I know now that you're semi-retired, probably about to come back on the air, I want to get you back on very, very soon.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.523]  I know you were going to come down in Austin this weekend, we were going to visit, because of the ice storm, you can't come now.
[01:23:13.283 --> 01:23:16.986]  So please, you and the wife come down, we'll get dinner, and I just really appreciate you.
[01:23:17.856 --> 01:23:19.397]  Alex, I love you and I appreciate you too.
[01:23:19.457 --> 01:23:26.762]  And look, the fact is that I'm getting taxed out of my house and living here in Chicago, the violence and the taxes.
[01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.063]  I'm ready to move to Texas.
[01:23:28.363 --> 01:23:31.966]  Although you tell me Austin has become kind of a liberal a-hole place.
[01:23:32.906 --> 01:23:35.208]  Only the downtown area and certain corridors.
[01:23:35.268 --> 01:23:37.569]  I mean, you go 10 miles in any direction, you're back in Texas.
[01:23:37.609 --> 01:23:38.950]  But yeah, it's bad.
[01:23:39.351 --> 01:23:40.391]  Is Texas done?
[01:23:40.592 --> 01:23:41.492]  Should I go to Florida?
[01:23:41.672 --> 01:23:43.914]  What's the last holdout for free-minded people?
[01:23:43.934 --> 01:23:46.796]  No, I mean, I think we need all the patriots to come to Texas to outnumber the Californians.
[01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:51.797]  Yeah, so the Californians came and they brought their cancer of liberalism, and now they destroyed Texas.
[01:23:51.977 --> 01:23:52.938]  Thanks a lot, guys!
[01:23:53.198 --> 01:23:54.299]  Thanks for your windmills!
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:55.540]  Now we don't have power.
[01:23:55.821 --> 01:24:02.286]  And by the way, yesterday, when I was in the middle of making a great point, they cut the power on us, didn't they?
[01:24:02.306 --> 01:24:05.088]  I think there was a power surge.
[01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:06.089]  How's your power today?
[01:24:06.589 --> 01:24:07.310]  How's your power?
[01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:10.873]  We have to still run off generators because the power is going on and off still.
[01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:11.813]  Yeah.
[01:24:12.494 --> 01:24:17.078]  Texas with the most energy in North America, and you don't have power today.
[01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:20.205]  Man, Cal, look forward to having you back on.
[01:24:20.225 --> 01:24:22.947]  Thanks for sharing your stories of Rush and everything else, and God bless you.
[01:24:23.207 --> 01:24:23.867]  Love you, Rush.
[01:24:24.007 --> 01:24:24.668]  Love you, Alex.
[01:24:24.928 --> 01:24:25.588]  Rest in peace.
[01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:28.090]  Look, our voices travel through the airwaves.
[01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:32.332]  Rush, we love you, and I want to ask the people of America to pray for me and Alex, please.
[01:24:32.372 --> 01:24:33.313]  We need your prayers.
[01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:36.695]  And like he said, you think we can get rewarded doing this?
[01:24:36.895 --> 01:24:37.215]  No.
[01:24:37.635 --> 01:24:37.915]  No.
[01:24:38.736 --> 01:24:42.818]  The devil's coming for us, but we're fighting in this place as a test, and we're going to win.
[01:24:42.838 --> 01:24:45.180]  And remember, good wins and God wins.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:46.480]  God bless you.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.081]  Take care, brother.
[01:24:48.812 --> 01:24:52.634]  Alright, there goes Man Cow, and they de-platformed everywhere, but he came back.
[01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:54.776]  You can find him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram for now.
[01:24:54.796 --> 01:24:56.517]  They might ban him, because he's been banned before.
[01:24:56.837 --> 01:24:58.438]  Okay, I'm out of time for this hour.
[01:24:58.478 --> 01:25:15.788]  I want to take calls, and we also have another guest joining us a little bit later, but you definitely want to tune in, because I've got to get into the actual energy shutdown, the admissions they did it by design, the power grab, but also General Honore preparing a Praetorian Guard to smash American gun owners and to try to trigger a civil war.
[01:25:15.808 --> 01:25:16.108]  People are like,
[01:25:16.328 --> 01:25:18.110]  They try to take the guns, it'll be a war.
[01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:19.571]  That's the plan, folks.
[01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:23.054]  So, we don't turn our guns in, but we don't have a civil war either.
[01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:26.998]  We've got to educate people about the globalist trap to have us all kill each other and not do it.
[01:25:27.418 --> 01:25:27.858]  Separately!
[01:25:28.689 --> 01:25:33.111]  I twisted their arm because they don't have a lot of profit in their food that's already so high quality and so low priced.
[01:25:33.771 --> 01:25:37.793]  MyPatriotSupply, powering InfoWarsTore.com is where you find this deal, only there.
[01:25:38.173 --> 01:25:41.835]  PrepareWithAlex.com takes you to a subdomain of InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:48.438]  PrepareWithAlex.com, 10% off, 4-week supplies, 3-month, 4-month, 6-month, year supplies.
[01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:52.780]  10% off, you're not going to find food anywhere this quality at this price.
[01:25:54.264 --> 01:25:59.890]  PrepareWithAlex.com or InfowarsStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:06.536]  They are shipping within 24 hours, some days, same day, from their four high-tech facilities.
[01:26:06.757 --> 01:26:10.080]  They're the number one company after 14 years because of quality and because of price.
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.864]  And they've scaled up so huge, they are dominating the competition.
[01:26:14.624 --> 01:26:15.345]  And I advised them.
[01:26:15.365 --> 01:26:16.286]  They actually asked my opinion.
[01:26:16.306 --> 01:26:17.807]  I told them to expand two years ago.
[01:26:17.827 --> 01:26:18.768]  I told them to expand a year ago.
[01:26:19.828 --> 01:26:20.529]  I'm really proud of them.
[01:26:20.549 --> 01:26:21.910]  They have the same instincts.
[01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:23.952]  They have the biggest facilities in the country now.
[01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:25.313]  It's ridiculous how good they are.
[01:26:25.693 --> 01:26:28.675]  Infowarsstore.com, and it funds the operation.
[01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:33.079]  A lot of other big deals there as well, like Winter Sun, vitamin D3 for your immune system.
[01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:36.742]  For adults, children, but especially old people, take it under the tongue for maximum absorption.
[01:26:37.082 --> 01:26:38.603]  It's discounted, but selling out quick.
[01:26:39.003 --> 01:26:41.766]  And you can get it for 40% off with Ultra 12.
[01:26:44.622 --> 01:26:48.705]  Waging war on corruption, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:26:48.725 --> 01:26:49.186]  to 3 p.m.
[01:26:49.206 --> 01:26:49.546]  Central.
[01:26:50.366 --> 01:27:06.059]  We've not been doing the American Journal the last four days because Austin's very hilly and a lot of the crew live on hilly areas where you cannot get down them because of now like a foot of solid black ice.
[01:27:07.513 --> 01:27:10.136]  I mean, it's like crystal blue, black ice, you name it.
[01:27:10.156 --> 01:27:16.021]  I mean, it's just thick, and it is bad, and there's nobody clearing it off, and folks don't have snow plows.
[01:27:17.803 --> 01:27:24.569]  And I tried to drive up to visit some family members that needed some help, and there were hundreds of wrecked cars just in one area of Westlake.
[01:27:24.589 --> 01:27:25.190]  Just hundreds.
[01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:27.592]  I mean, just wrecked cars all up and down these hills.
[01:27:28.233 --> 01:27:29.234]  Some roads are blocked.
[01:27:29.914 --> 01:27:32.397]  And, you know, here's a side issue I'll talk about when we come back next segment.
[01:27:34.437 --> 01:27:36.138]  I've grown up in Dallas and Austin.
[01:27:36.179 --> 01:27:39.401]  I mean, they used to have snow plows, they used to have salt trucks and all that.
[01:27:39.521 --> 01:27:40.682]  I don't see any of them now.
[01:27:42.284 --> 01:27:45.406]  That's a real photo we're just showing you.
[01:27:47.448 --> 01:27:50.711]  Let's go ahead and roll some of this though with the coming protest this Saturday at ERCOT.
[01:27:51.271 --> 01:27:54.113]  Let's roll that and we'll come back from break and I'll give the number out and take your calls.
[01:27:56.155 --> 01:27:57.236]  ERCOT is in run!
[01:28:04.450 --> 01:28:04.758]  Oh my God!
[01:28:05.712 --> 01:28:13.817]  You are criminal shutting off our power.
[01:28:13.898 --> 01:28:14.758]  We know you, Richard.
[01:28:14.798 --> 01:28:17.380]  The whistleblowers are coming tomorrow.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.481]  Texas has plenty of power.
[01:28:18.641 --> 01:28:21.943]  You are turning us to have less power and take more.
[01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:31.289]  Reuters reports power prices on the open market up 10,000% as you hold the state hostage so outside power groups like vultures, like Enron did, can feed on us.
[01:28:31.809 --> 01:28:35.472]  You thought because it's been 20 years since Enron did this to the West Coast,
[01:28:35.932 --> 01:28:36.953]  You would get away with this.
[01:28:37.453 --> 01:28:40.194]  You are not getting away with it, you criminals!
[01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:48.219]  And so coming up this Saturday, we're going to protest the big tech, great recent Democrat poll.
[01:28:48.359 --> 01:28:52.701]  Greg Abbott, Ed Noon, at the Governor's Mansion.
[01:28:52.801 --> 01:28:53.602]  He's essential.
[01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:54.602]  He's got power.
[01:28:55.743 --> 01:29:01.306]  And then at 2 p.m., we're coming down here on 290 towards the airport.
[01:29:02.286 --> 01:29:03.667]  We're good to go.
[01:29:23.112 --> 01:29:28.718]  We know they've done it before, they've been caught, and now the whistleblowers are set to go public!
[01:29:29.439 --> 01:29:39.010]  That's why they put this puppet woman in right before they hit it, because the people actually running it don't want to go to prison, they want to set her up like Cuomo, but she's part of it too.
[01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:40.832]  You're all going to prison!
[01:29:53.413 --> 01:29:54.494]  This is serious, folks.
[01:29:55.214 --> 01:29:55.975]  This is war.
[01:29:57.015 --> 01:29:58.656]  They're shutting our energy systems off.
[01:29:59.417 --> 01:30:00.137]  By design.
[01:30:01.018 --> 01:30:02.078]  They know what they're doing.
[01:30:02.578 --> 01:30:03.299]  They're technocrats.
[01:30:03.319 --> 01:30:04.900]  They think you're so stupid to figure it out.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.381]  Figure it out or be overrun and starve to death!
[01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:09.002]  They're about to kill the U.S.
[01:30:09.042 --> 01:30:09.402]  dollar.
[01:30:09.903 --> 01:30:11.464]  They're signaling worldwide that the U.S.
[01:30:11.544 --> 01:30:11.924]  is over.
[01:30:12.844 --> 01:30:15.986]  So at least once they crash the economy, remember who did this to you.
[01:30:16.687 --> 01:30:17.127]  Remember!
[01:30:17.847 --> 01:30:18.768]  This is war, people.
[01:30:19.048 --> 01:30:19.689]  This isn't a joke.
[01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:21.910]  Noticing all those criminals!
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:37.830]  ERCOT Chairwoman Sally the Democrat Tolbert and their other globalist accomplices, whistleblowers inside the organization as well as the EPA and Texas government are prepared to come forward and expose your giant Enron style scam.
[01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:50.018]  You're hereby ordered by we the people to cease and desist your staged blackout designed to condition Americans to accept the Great Reset and the carbon credit rationing.
[01:30:51.181 --> 01:30:54.822]  Justice Governor Cuomo will be sent to prison for his crimes against humanity.
[01:30:55.682 --> 01:30:57.023]  You will be held accountable.
[01:30:57.623 --> 01:30:58.323]  One last time.
[01:30:58.363 --> 01:31:09.286]  We are aware of your criminal enterprise to trick the public into accepting smart meter monitoring of thermostats and to jack up power prices as much as 10,000%.
[01:31:09.326 --> 01:31:11.467]  Stop your criminal activity now.
[01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:16.208]  We the people are watching Alex Jones.
[01:31:16.288 --> 01:31:18.008]  And now because he's- He'll be back.
[01:31:18.088 --> 01:31:19.449]  I'll give the number out and take your calls.
[01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:30.693]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:45.058]  One that has gained my personal attention is Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[01:31:46.297 --> 01:31:56.781]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[01:31:57.861 --> 01:31:59.862]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[01:32:00.462 --> 01:32:07.124]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.
[01:32:08.265 --> 01:32:14.847]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community.
[01:32:15.819 --> 01:32:29.207]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[01:32:30.368 --> 01:32:42.615]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[01:32:43.945 --> 01:33:00.939]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp... That's former CIA Director John Brennan six years ago under Obama.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:12.449]  But, oh, there's no weather weapons, because they don't want you to even know about it, but the academic level, the governmental level, they talk about it like it's the fact that, you know, there's a lot of tea in China or the sky's blue.
[01:33:13.237 --> 01:33:14.258]  But let's go to the next clip.
[01:33:14.278 --> 01:33:14.798]  Remember this clip?
[01:33:14.818 --> 01:33:15.899]  It's now getting national attention.
[01:33:15.919 --> 01:33:16.959]  That's why Infowars is important.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.100]  They've tracked it so many times.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:18.781]  We break it.
[01:33:19.141 --> 01:33:20.021]  We put it out first.
[01:33:20.342 --> 01:33:21.502]  And then it goes mega viral.
[01:33:22.443 --> 01:33:30.308]  Same thing now happened with other great folks like Gateway Pundit, because more and more Breitbart and other things just won't put out a lot of the hardcore stuff, unfortunately.
[01:33:30.728 --> 01:33:31.429]  I'm not mad at them.
[01:33:31.469 --> 01:33:33.710]  I mean, I wish they'd just do better, but I don't understand the heat they're under.
[01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:39.994]  But here's the Green Czar in Massachusetts saying, you know that old person down the street, the retiree?
[01:33:40.435 --> 01:33:41.475]  We've got to break their will.
[01:33:41.495 --> 01:33:42.376]  We've got to cut their power.
[01:33:42.816 --> 01:33:44.357]  And they talk about rolling blackouts.
[01:33:44.377 --> 01:33:46.740]  I'm going to show you articles, by the way, to train you to accept it.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.622]  I learned about this 20 plus years ago.
[01:33:49.642 --> 01:33:57.730]  I was on air then and it came out, mainstream news, that Enron had deployed and developed the idea for greenhouse gas caps.
[01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:59.992]  They developed the carbon tax model.
[01:34:01.283 --> 01:34:04.704]  And they also proposed the geoengineering announcement going on.
[01:34:05.445 --> 01:34:08.046]  But the globalists just got rid of that group and took it over for themselves.
[01:34:08.726 --> 01:34:14.608]  And so they're the very ones that recommended rolling blackouts to train you to accept spikes in power prices.
[01:34:14.628 --> 01:34:20.951]  There's an article from 2002, May 16th, Market Watch, Enron linked to California blackouts.
[01:34:20.991 --> 01:34:24.472]  And they did it under orders to then charge people more money.
[01:34:25.012 --> 01:34:31.117]  And they've been charging up to 10,000% more outside the state to bring power in, according to Reuters.
[01:34:31.618 --> 01:34:45.269]  So billions and billions has been made because the state, via ERCOT, the private group, I have the articles I'll show you coming up, ordered the coal power plants to shut down for the winter.
[01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:47.150]  You heard me right.
[01:34:47.851 --> 01:34:49.612]  They already shut down over 100 under Obama.
[01:34:49.652 --> 01:34:51.094]  Trump should barely get any new ones open.
[01:34:51.214 --> 01:34:52.595]  Thousands got shut down nationwide.
[01:34:54.949 --> 01:34:56.951]  And then ERCOT, the new Enron.
[01:34:57.991 --> 01:35:02.215]  By the way, it's not just run by people in Michigan, nothing against Michiganders, and people in New York.
[01:35:02.355 --> 01:35:03.356]  Germans run it!
[01:35:04.697 --> 01:35:05.657]  It's not even American!
[01:35:07.039 --> 01:35:13.243]  And all the little power grids, Texas had the best in the country, were ordered to tie end it and give control to them.
[01:35:14.785 --> 01:35:22.971]  And then Obama, excuse me, his puppet, his mouthpiece, Biden comes out and says, oh, we're going to federalize Texas.
[01:35:23.031 --> 01:35:23.932]  It's all their fault.
[01:35:25.481 --> 01:35:30.942]  They're from Canada, they're from Germany, they're from all over, and they run the stupid Americans.
[01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:38.924]  So here is the little globalist, a few weeks ago, now getting attention on Tucker Carlson, saying they're going to break your will.
[01:35:38.964 --> 01:35:39.344]  Here it is.
[01:35:41.085 --> 01:35:50.947]  You know, one thing that we found through our analysis is that 60% of our emissions come from, as I have been starting to say, you and me, except you guys are in Vermont.
[01:35:50.967 --> 01:35:53.808]  60% of our emissions come from residential heating.
[01:35:55.552 --> 01:35:56.933]  And passenger vehicles.
[01:35:57.133 --> 01:35:57.833]  So let me say that again.
[01:35:57.853 --> 01:36:07.519]  60% of our emissions that need to be reduced come from you, the person of retreat, the senior on fixed income, right?
[01:36:08.019 --> 01:36:17.084]  There is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts, to point the finger at, turn the screws on, and break their will so they stop emitting.
[01:36:17.324 --> 01:36:17.804]  That's you.
[01:36:17.824 --> 01:36:18.945]  We have to break your will.
[01:36:20.506 --> 01:36:21.726]  I can't even say that publicly.
[01:36:21.786 --> 01:36:22.467]  What I'm trying to say is,
[01:36:23.834 --> 01:36:25.055]  Yeah, you can't even say that publicly.
[01:36:25.395 --> 01:36:27.356]  Here, so let's read some of the headlines.
[01:36:27.376 --> 01:36:28.737]  I'll give you the number and I'll take your calls.
[01:36:29.877 --> 01:36:36.341]  Mass Climate Czar said we have to break your will to blame the people for needed tax increases to fight climate change.
[01:36:36.361 --> 01:36:40.543]  So we have to transfer money to ourselves for our new green energy that doesn't work.
[01:36:40.743 --> 01:36:43.064]  That's David Isma, yes.
[01:36:43.805 --> 01:36:44.985]  What a nice little person.
[01:36:45.546 --> 01:36:46.666]  He works for John Kerry.
[01:36:46.966 --> 01:36:51.269]  California's rolling blackouts were nothing compared to Texas' winter grid meltdown.
[01:36:52.403 --> 01:36:53.763]  Facebook blocks news.
[01:36:53.843 --> 01:36:55.544]  Government and health updates in Australia.
[01:36:55.924 --> 01:36:58.084]  Now controlling government information.
[01:36:58.624 --> 01:37:00.525]  The government says that they've been hijacked by Facebook.
[01:37:00.645 --> 01:37:01.665]  Oh, that got in the wrong stack.
[01:37:01.705 --> 01:37:02.365]  I'll cover that later.
[01:37:02.905 --> 01:37:04.745]  Power outages set to continue.
[01:37:04.865 --> 01:37:09.086]  ERCOT says without them, a blackout could last for months.
[01:37:09.926 --> 01:37:11.987]  What did I tell you on Monday and Tuesday?
[01:37:12.027 --> 01:37:15.328]  And people said, Jones, even my crew said, Jones, you're going too far.
[01:37:15.348 --> 01:37:16.188]  Will you guys bring me a pen?
[01:37:16.228 --> 01:37:17.188]  I walked out of the room with my pen.
[01:37:18.372 --> 01:37:18.732]  Thank you.
[01:37:18.993 --> 01:37:19.593]  Maybe a highlighter.
[01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:22.275]  I'm not in my regular studio, because we're not back in the main studio right now.
[01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:27.998]  It has power, but we've got to reboot a bunch of stuff, and it's a big, long hassle, so I'm in the old studio, which I kind of like.
[01:37:28.298 --> 01:37:36.083]  It's more roomy, actually, in here, but... Notice I said on Monday and Tuesday, I said, the power's never coming back.
[01:37:36.764 --> 01:37:41.707]  And I said, by that, you're going to pay way more, and it's going to be sporadic, because they're training you to have less.
[01:37:41.767 --> 01:37:42.407]  They admit it.
[01:37:42.827 --> 01:37:45.009]  All I do is read what these jerks
[01:37:46.428 --> 01:37:49.049]  And that's putting, they're fucking pieces of shit assholes.
[01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.349]  Okay.
[01:37:52.449 --> 01:37:56.910]  They are murdering, out of control, sick control freaks.
[01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:57.891]  You guys get that delayed?
[01:38:00.231 --> 01:38:00.451]  Good.
[01:38:00.491 --> 01:38:01.372]  I'm not going to do that anymore.
[01:38:01.772 --> 01:38:03.452]  But I mean, calling them jerks is not enough.
[01:38:03.532 --> 01:38:03.792]  Okay.
[01:38:04.592 --> 01:38:07.573]  I mean, now they're saying like 50 something people died in Texas because of this.
[01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:14.675]  I mean, they brag in England that they heat all the palaces and castles that the Royals have.
[01:38:14.715 --> 01:38:15.695]  It's over a hundred of them.
[01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:20.354]  One of them is called Prince Charles's Cottage, and it's like 50 rooms.
[01:38:21.515 --> 01:38:22.216]  Or maybe bedrooms.
[01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:23.737]  The Cottage!
[01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.599]  And meanwhile, he's usually even in Transylvania.
[01:38:26.639 --> 01:38:28.341]  He lives in Count Dracula's castle.
[01:38:29.642 --> 01:38:31.984]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking about that.
[01:38:33.655 --> 01:38:37.938]  He bought Count Dracula's Castle, moved into it, because he's directly related to him.
[01:38:38.698 --> 01:38:45.281]  And then it talks about pensioners, old people, get on the buses because they have heat in the winter so they don't freeze to death.
[01:38:45.742 --> 01:38:51.585]  And now the government was saying, no, you kick old people off when they have a year-round bus pass and they're allowed to stay on.
[01:38:51.945 --> 01:38:53.486]  Make them get off after a few stops.
[01:38:53.506 --> 01:38:55.267]  They're not allowed to stay on the bus and live.
[01:38:55.887 --> 01:38:57.788]  So they're freezing old people to death.
[01:38:59.224 --> 01:39:09.950]  Because they've cut off so many of the power plants, they run off these windmills, and then they're saying, oh, natural gas is too expensive, and it was costing something like four billion pounds a year, or just some, it was years ago.
[01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:11.731]  The number was just stratospheric.
[01:39:12.371 --> 01:39:21.116]  To heat the palaces, giant palaces with 50-foot ceilings, hundreds of rooms, you know, giant palatial facilities.
[01:39:22.748 --> 01:39:23.989]  Oh yeah, guys, I'm not kidding.
[01:39:24.029 --> 01:39:27.253]  Type in Prince Charles Count Dracula and click web.
[01:39:27.593 --> 01:39:29.195]  You'll get Guardian, AP, Reuters.
[01:39:29.635 --> 01:39:35.201]  He says he's the descendant of Vlad, very proud of it, and actually has moved with a bunch of orphan boys.
[01:39:36.522 --> 01:39:38.545]  I've seen the articles of them with little kids in the castle.
[01:39:39.105 --> 01:39:43.568]  And it's like the children are supplied to him because he lovingly cares for them.
[01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:48.732]  That's the castle and it's him like a little boy putting his arms around him and you can't make this up.
[01:39:49.152 --> 01:39:55.137]  His best friend is Jimmy Savelle, the child torturer, and Satan is to add underground dungeons where he murdered children and had sex with their dead bodies.
[01:39:55.577 --> 01:39:58.119]  Again, if you're a listener, I'm not making any of this up.
[01:40:00.441 --> 01:40:03.923]  Reg Charles vampire links to Count Dracula revealed as royal turned 70.
[01:40:04.524 --> 01:40:05.324]  That's the star!
[01:40:05.384 --> 01:40:09.427]  I mean, no, there's Guardian articles, there's PBS documentaries gushing about it.
[01:40:09.747 --> 01:40:13.289]  Look how strikingly handsome he is, like Vlad the Impaler.
[01:40:13.749 --> 01:40:18.892]  Here he is at the local Transylvanian village, the orphanage, where he's taken in the little boys.
[01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.775]  Some of the boys live with him, and they say they love him.
[01:40:24.124 --> 01:40:30.088]  There he is with Greta Thunberg, completely mentally ill, completely out of her mind, reads off a script, totally autistic.
[01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:33.311]  All right, I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[01:40:33.331 --> 01:40:34.251]  I'm gonna behave myself.
[01:40:35.953 --> 01:40:46.941]  I'm gonna get into the climate news, then I'm gonna get into the unraveling of the Capitol as it comes out that the Democrats staged the whole deal, provocateured, and had feds inside of the few right-wing groups that actually broke in.
[01:40:46.961 --> 01:40:49.943]  And it's all coming out, so just get ready for that.
[01:40:50.243 --> 01:40:51.164]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:40:52.546 --> 01:41:05.169]  If you are a TV viewer, you can see me showing you Count Dracula, the direct main heir in the royal bloodline of Count Vlad the Impaler of the Saxe-Coburg Gotha, not British, Transylvanian.
[01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:08.409]  I just don't want to, like, make these claims.
[01:41:08.489 --> 01:41:10.830]  It sounds insane to not show you mainstream news.
[01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:15.251]  We pull up the mainstream article that he's the main heir to Count Dracula, please, from the Sunday Express.
[01:41:16.803 --> 01:41:19.786]  Let's show that article for folks on screen.
[01:41:19.806 --> 01:41:21.107]  It was on my computer right in there.
[01:41:21.127 --> 01:41:22.488]  I just had it pulled up during the break.
[01:41:23.529 --> 01:41:28.354]  And then let's go ahead and, oh yes, here they are introducing him to Count Dracula.
[01:41:29.074 --> 01:41:32.497]  And then let's go ahead and show the articles I pulled up for you during the break, guys.
[01:41:33.278 --> 01:41:39.424]  And that is him with the orphans that live with him, that hug him and love him, and that visit him at the castle.
[01:41:39.884 --> 01:41:42.747]  Vlad the Impaler, how Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth related to him.
[01:41:43.067 --> 01:41:44.789]  Yeah, that's not the one we just pulled up.
[01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:45.790]  There it is.
[01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:50.935]  Prince Charles' family tree, how Prince Charles is actually heir to Dracula's bloodline.
[01:41:50.995 --> 01:41:51.436]  Thank you.
[01:41:51.996 --> 01:41:52.997]  That's what I wanted to show.
[01:41:53.037 --> 01:41:53.158]  Now...
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:57.541]  We also found him with the orphaned children that come and stay with him.
[01:41:57.581 --> 01:41:58.602]  There it is, revealed.
[01:41:58.682 --> 01:42:03.524]  Touching story behind Prince Charles' affectionate hug with schoolboy.
[01:42:04.064 --> 01:42:05.865]  And it says, well, these boys know him.
[01:42:05.905 --> 01:42:09.966]  They come and visit him and then stay at the Castle Dracula.
[01:42:10.606 --> 01:42:11.327]  I'm going to say that again.
[01:42:11.367 --> 01:42:14.448]  They stay at Castle Dracula.
[01:42:15.909 --> 01:42:19.090]  And what did Bram Stoker write 100-something years ago?
[01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:24.271]  Back when you couldn't put reality out, you'd get killed, but you could put it as fiction.
[01:42:24.331 --> 01:42:47.701]  He said that the head of the satanic order came from Transylvania to England and buried itself under Carfax Abbey and took over the Church of England, and that it was a count, it was royalty, and that it was going around stealing babies to feed it to his mistresses of the night, that they were having blood rituals, drinking the blood of babies.
[01:42:48.241 --> 01:42:48.902]  Well, that's what
[01:42:49.776 --> 01:42:58.783]  On record, Jimmy Savelle, the best friend of Prince Charles, the highest security clearance you can get in the United Kingdom and the British Empire.
[01:42:58.823 --> 01:43:04.767]  He had the highest security clearance that even real James Bond, you know, 007 MI6 agents cannot even get.
[01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:09.951]  A higher security clearance than only the royal family.
[01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:12.333]  He had the groom of the stool certificate.
[01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:16.256]  They didn't call it that in modern parlance, but usually the
[01:43:17.737 --> 01:43:23.859]  Ex-checkerhead or one of the top government ministers would wipe the butt of the king or the queen because they had to wear these big, giant, flowing robes.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:28.701]  That's why they called it a stool because it looks like a stool you sit on.
[01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:33.663]  And then this would be the person that lovingly would wipe the butt of the king or the queen.
[01:43:34.464 --> 01:43:35.124]  I'm not joking.
[01:43:35.924 --> 01:43:43.347]  And so you have to understand that the groom of the stool for Prince Charles, we put up Jimmy Savelle, please.
[01:43:43.887 --> 01:43:45.368]  I didn't mean to go off into this today, but
[01:43:46.656 --> 01:43:55.372]  We should understand, Prince Charles admits he's running the great race, said he wants to starve you to death, he wants to exterminate the third world, and he is literally the heir to Count Dracula!
[01:43:56.311 --> 01:44:04.857]  And then they put it into fiction, Bram Stoker did, where he explains who really runs England 150 years ago was this group.
[01:44:04.877 --> 01:44:05.337]  Now there he is.
[01:44:05.737 --> 01:44:11.561]  The highest security clearance in the UK to be able to go into any royal quarter at any time.
[01:44:11.941 --> 01:44:12.982]  No one can stop him.
[01:44:13.602 --> 01:44:17.985]  He has a secret badge that gives him entrance into the Queen of England's bedroom at night.
[01:44:18.666 --> 01:44:22.068]  This, I give you, is Renfield Super Supremus.
[01:44:22.348 --> 01:44:23.149]  Back on screen, please.
[01:44:23.849 --> 01:44:26.930]  Super Supremacist Renfield, ass-wiper of Prince Charles.
[01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:28.010]  Literally.
[01:44:28.991 --> 01:44:29.491]  Literally.
[01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:33.532]  And they're always digging up dead children all over the grounds of the area.
[01:44:34.233 --> 01:44:36.894]  So, those look like nice fellows to you?
[01:44:37.714 --> 01:44:43.896]  There's Prince Charles in a moment of not putting on his friendly act, but actually getting the Dracula smile going.
[01:44:44.176 --> 01:44:47.097]  And let me tell you, I'm sure it's quite a smile.
[01:44:47.517 --> 01:44:50.778]  It would put the Joker to shame, and it's what victims see.
[01:44:50.898 --> 01:44:50.998]  So.
[01:44:53.288 --> 01:45:02.790]  I just thought we'd spend a little bit of time talking about who's running the whole Great Reset and who the little Romanian children run up the street and thank.
[01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:19.074]  I mean, it's like, why were all these children, because they didn't find the one I found, like 20 children just hugging him and worshipping him and him rubbing all over the little boys, and it said, oh, they go and stay with him at the castle by themselves with Count Dracula.
[01:45:20.695 --> 01:45:23.458]  The little children say, we'll count Dracula.
[01:45:23.999 --> 01:45:30.926]  And then, pull up Jimmy Savelle had secret dungeons where he murdered and tortured children and delivered them to British Prime Ministers.
[01:45:31.997 --> 01:45:39.224]  And I remember David Icke was the first person to say that Jimmy Savelle, because he worked at BBC when Savelle was there 30, 40 years ago.
[01:45:39.744 --> 01:45:40.164]  Icke's old.
[01:45:40.885 --> 01:45:42.767]  Icke was like the top TV host, by the way.
[01:45:42.847 --> 01:45:44.268]  He had like a morning show and a nighttime show.
[01:45:44.288 --> 01:45:45.850]  He was like the top host in the UK.
[01:45:46.410 --> 01:45:50.874]  And he's like, there are a bunch of devil whispers, there are a bunch of pedophiles, and you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:50.934 --> 01:45:52.716]  And I've had this vision, I've got to expose them.
[01:45:52.736 --> 01:45:54.337]  And he was kind of getting the downloads.
[01:45:54.377 --> 01:45:57.180]  He seemed a little crazy, but don't prophets always seem crazy up front.
[01:45:58.704 --> 01:46:03.507]  And boom, but he told me on the show like 20 years ago about Lord Heath.
[01:46:04.628 --> 01:46:05.829]  His thing was little girls though.
[01:46:05.889 --> 01:46:06.969]  Most of them liked to rape little boys.
[01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:15.335]  And they would leave him, like a little seven-year-old girl was his favorite, little pigtails, and they'd lay out plastic in there and she'd come in and stand and she'd be a little orphan they brought in.
[01:46:15.915 --> 01:46:20.018]  And then she would stand right there, yeah, and Jimmy Savelle would deliver the orphan children.
[01:46:20.978 --> 01:46:27.841]  And then he would pull out a double-edged dagger, he would walk behind her, slit her throat, and then masturbate while she flopped around dying.
[01:46:27.961 --> 01:46:29.381]  He didn't even want to have sex with her.
[01:46:29.401 --> 01:46:33.063]  He would just masturbate while they gulped and flopped around and blood sprayed.
[01:46:33.503 --> 01:46:41.826]  So, it's all extremely liberal, extremely trendy to understand the finer things of spirit cooking.
[01:46:42.666 --> 01:46:44.087]  But you will, my pretties!
[01:46:44.988 --> 01:46:47.430]  So now you know why they want to turn your power off.
[01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:49.531]  Now you know why they don't want any discussion.
[01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:55.736]  CNN's always, there's no pedophilia, there's no corruption, there's nothing bad happening, there's nothing going on.
[01:46:56.136 --> 01:46:58.438]  Just everything is fine.
[01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:03.742]  Everything is honky-dory, as they say in the old pig Latin.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:12.451]  So then you learn that Renfield is not a fictitious character, but is an archetype of the servant of the dragon.
[01:47:13.713 --> 01:47:15.575]  The dragon of the Bible.
[01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:16.396]  The devil.
[01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:17.518]  Satan.
[01:47:19.982 --> 01:47:21.223]  The one chain to this planet.
[01:47:22.085 --> 01:47:30.330]  Alright, now I'm going to stop now, and I said I'd hit all the, turn the power news off, and General Adyaray's plan to wage total war against you for the Dragon.
[01:47:30.871 --> 01:47:33.473]  The Dragon will overcome the Saints, but only for a small period of time.
[01:47:34.013 --> 01:47:35.394]  All of that is going to be coming up.
[01:47:37.048 --> 01:47:39.230]  But let's just give the number out and take calls first.
[01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:40.751]  You can talk about the power outages.
[01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:50.098]  You can talk about General Idura openly preparing to purge gun owners and say they're going to have a glorious war and take our guns and take our children and put them in re-education camps ahead of PBS and all of it.
[01:47:50.498 --> 01:47:51.419]  And it's all coming out.
[01:47:51.439 --> 01:47:52.359]  I mean, what do you think of that?
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:53.400]  Pretty fabulous, huh?
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.182]  They're going to have to have false flags to get that job done.
[01:47:56.623 --> 01:47:57.243]  And that's what's coming.
[01:47:57.263 --> 01:47:58.144]  So how do we stop those?
[01:47:58.184 --> 01:47:58.624]  What do we do?
[01:47:59.465 --> 01:48:03.828]  It's all coming up today on this Thursday, February 18th, Global Transmission.
[01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:12.312]  So, as we do this important work here, I want to hear from you on any subject.
[01:48:13.072 --> 01:48:16.193]  All I ask is that you be a first-time caller, and you don't need to thank me.
[01:48:16.574 --> 01:48:17.954]  Like Drush always said, dittos.
[01:48:18.334 --> 01:48:19.775]  And we'll just move on to the next person.
[01:48:19.795 --> 01:48:21.015]  I don't want to sound rude or curt.
[01:48:21.335 --> 01:48:22.055]  I've got to get to you.
[01:48:22.075 --> 01:48:22.115]  877-789-2539.
[01:48:22.135 --> 01:48:22.296]  877-789-2539.
[01:48:22.316 --> 01:48:22.356]  877-789-2539.
[01:48:32.219 --> 01:48:35.762]  And we're not going to have an old ancient castle that's a thousand years old.
[01:48:35.822 --> 01:48:38.384]  We're not going to have children over in the dark night.
[01:48:38.404 --> 01:48:41.127]  We're not going to hire people that have dungeons with dead children in them.
[01:48:41.647 --> 01:48:54.939]  We're just going to fight for the Lord and fight for goodness and fight for freedom and fight for our right to defend ourselves as the crime rate doubles in the country, murder rate 30% plus up, and the Democrats have giant armed camps and armed guards at taxpayer's expense that want our guns.
[01:48:55.399 --> 01:49:11.144]  We're just gonna just get ready and gear up, because the forces of Satan are energizing to just cut our power off, kill the dollar, flood the border, shut everything down, tell us we're not essential, and just rape the living hell out of us, because they are under dragon command!
[01:49:11.724 --> 01:49:13.625]  Prince Charles runs the whole show!
[01:49:14.086 --> 01:49:15.147]  Bill Gates is under him!
[01:49:15.487 --> 01:49:16.688]  Klaus Schwab is under him!
[01:49:17.028 --> 01:49:18.489]  Jean-Claude Juncker is under him!
[01:49:18.609 --> 01:49:23.433]  All the royalty of the world give him fealty in a yearly ritual of satanic power!
[01:49:23.913 --> 01:49:25.514]  And now he's coming to kill!
[01:49:25.534 --> 01:49:26.235]  Ha ha ha!
[01:49:26.295 --> 01:49:27.095]  Prince Charles!
[01:49:27.356 --> 01:49:28.497]  Prince Dracula!
[01:49:28.697 --> 01:49:32.800]  May he burn in hell forever in the high noon sun of Christ!
[01:49:35.419 --> 01:49:39.842]  Imagine being a new listener, and you just tuned in the last segment, and I'm like just saying all that, and you're a radio listener.
[01:49:40.142 --> 01:49:47.687]  You don't know that I'm showing ABC, CBS, BBC, you know, actual footage of Prince Charles.
[01:49:47.707 --> 01:49:48.808]  He is the heir to Dracula.
[01:49:48.828 --> 01:49:49.989]  He owns Dracula Castle.
[01:49:50.269 --> 01:49:52.751]  Children from the orphanage come and stay with him at night, alone.
[01:49:52.831 --> 01:49:54.572]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:49:54.972 --> 01:49:56.473]  Top pedophiles delivering children.
[01:49:57.054 --> 01:49:58.435]  And then that's just one of these people.
[01:49:58.955 --> 01:50:00.616]  What do you think Jeffrey Epstein was up to?
[01:50:00.936 --> 01:50:04.359]  He hangs out with this royal filth, with Prince Charles' brother, constantly.
[01:50:05.896 --> 01:50:08.297]  These are selfish, horrible psychopaths.
[01:50:10.159 --> 01:50:12.240]  And they feed on the energy of children.
[01:50:13.301 --> 01:50:14.962]  Gosh, pull up his dad, Prince Philip.
[01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:21.045]  All right, we got loaded phone lines, but there's something going on with my computer screen, so they're getting the calls over here so I can see it.
[01:50:21.946 --> 01:50:24.107]  And as soon as that happens, I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:50:24.588 --> 01:50:25.628]  Let me just throw this out there.
[01:50:25.648 --> 01:50:28.770]  We will not be on air unless you financially support us.
[01:50:29.331 --> 01:50:31.012]  I'm not complaining, I'm not bitching.
[01:50:31.152 --> 01:50:32.913]  If you want us to stay on air, buy the products.
[01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:34.494]  They're great products that you need.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.941]  The supplements are the highest end you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:50:38.961 --> 01:50:45.043]  To get other vitamins that are organic and high-end like these, most people pay two or three times, take DNA Force.
[01:50:45.524 --> 01:50:49.565]  People pay a lot more for this high-quality CoQ10, PQQ, and the rest of it.
[01:50:49.605 --> 01:50:52.366]  It's just amazing for your whole cellular health, your whole body.
[01:50:52.886 --> 01:50:55.427]  That's it in fullworkstore.com, very close to selling out.
[01:50:55.707 --> 01:50:59.629]  We have the Winter Sun, very high-quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system.
[01:51:00.809 --> 01:51:02.350]  It's essential, meaning it's something you have to have.
[01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:04.612]  A lot of folks have vitamin D3 absorption problems.
[01:51:04.912 --> 01:51:06.133]  That's why you should take it under the tongue.
[01:51:06.153 --> 01:51:06.934]  Let it sit for a minute.
[01:51:06.994 --> 01:51:08.055]  It's sweet naturally.
[01:51:08.075 --> 01:51:09.256]  There's no sweetener in this.
[01:51:09.676 --> 01:51:10.536]  And then swallow the rest.
[01:51:10.957 --> 01:51:11.657]  It's amazing.
[01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:15.400]  Winter Sun is close to selling out, but I'm keeping it discounted.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.943]  Infowarstorm.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:51:18.963 --> 01:51:20.444]  And then separately, 10% off on all affordable food.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:30.364]  That's the first big sale of the year there on the Storable Food InfoWars store.
[01:51:30.864 --> 01:51:34.248]  The four-week, the three-month, the six-month, the year, all of it.
[01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:39.852]  Ready to ship right now out of their four distribution centers around the country.
[01:51:39.892 --> 01:51:42.193]  During the week, it's shipped usually same day or the next day.
[01:51:42.213 --> 01:51:44.115]  If you order like on a Saturday, it'll be shipped on Monday.
[01:51:44.495 --> 01:51:47.717]  Ready to come to you anywhere in the United States.
[01:51:48.177 --> 01:51:54.041]  And they have the ProPure Pro stainless steel high-quality gravity filter, highest rated filters for $216.
[01:51:54.081 --> 01:51:56.963]  Leading competitors are $350 to $300 when they're discounted and are not as rated as high.
[01:52:02.927 --> 01:52:05.448]  I carry several other brands that are also high-rated as well.
[01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:09.290]  It's just not at the prices of this because they just can't go that low.
[01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:12.052]  The scalability of the same folks that own MyPatriot.
[01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:16.694]  They got this and they have the ion, four-stage ion filter.
[01:52:16.934 --> 01:52:21.396]  They're just into taking products, making them even better, and then lowering the price via scalability.
[01:52:23.177 --> 01:52:24.758]  Old-fashioned way America got built.
[01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:27.199]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:27.239 --> 01:52:27.399]  Okay.
[01:52:31.769 --> 01:52:32.529]  Where do we start?
[01:52:32.609 --> 01:52:33.390]  Where do we begin?
[01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:35.290]  Look, I need to go to your phone calls.
[01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:39.132]  I did a lot of preparation this morning, and I've only scratched the surface of the news.
[01:52:40.132 --> 01:52:47.454]  But your calls are most important, so... China's in the news admitting they have weather control.
[01:52:47.554 --> 01:52:48.295]  That's mainstream news.
[01:52:49.175 --> 01:52:50.856]  Not just the former head of the CIA admits it.
[01:52:50.896 --> 01:52:52.276]  Now they're bragging they control the weather.
[01:52:52.916 --> 01:52:55.477]  But you're not allowed to know that this is going on, you dumb Americans.
[01:52:56.257 --> 01:52:57.678]  So we've got all of that.
[01:52:59.824 --> 01:53:05.008]  They basically say within a few years we'll have total weather control over China, which again affects all the other countries.
[01:53:05.048 --> 01:53:11.573]  But we're not allowed to admit we've been doing it forever because, well, the news said it doesn't exist, like world government or the Great Reset.
[01:53:12.174 --> 01:53:19.399]  So we've got that type of news here and just really important stuff about these power outages and how they admit it's by design and a plan.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.741]  It's not incompetence, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.422]  And then I told you they're going to want to federalize the grid.
[01:53:24.842 --> 01:53:32.625]  They're going to want to put control thermostats in all your houses and remote control that are already in most houses via the smart meters and the actual controllers on the walls.
[01:53:32.945 --> 01:53:34.125]  And now they announced it all today.
[01:53:34.725 --> 01:53:38.067]  I have literally probably 30 articles the guys printed because I knew it was there.
[01:53:38.087 --> 01:53:42.168]  I just said, just print where they blame Texas and print where they say they got to control your thermostat and stop it.
[01:53:42.188 --> 01:53:43.469]  They're like, yeah, there's like hundreds.
[01:53:43.489 --> 01:53:44.129]  Which ones you want?
[01:53:44.429 --> 01:53:46.250]  I just print 30 of them, you know, just 30.
[01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:48.950]  I didn't even know they were saying that!
[01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:49.510]  I knew they were.
[01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:52.571]  See, let me tell you guys, folks, it's the same damn thing.
[01:53:53.651 --> 01:53:59.252]  It's like, how'd you know you got a Labrador puppy and it would be a great swimmer and like to retrieve things?
[01:53:59.312 --> 01:54:00.953]  I'm like, that's what they do.
[01:54:01.413 --> 01:54:03.973]  I mean, the globalists do this crap over and over again.
[01:54:04.733 --> 01:54:13.875]  And that's what's so frustrating to me is they're blood drinking, child raping devil worshipers at the top with a bunch of dumb order followers under them that treat us like animals.
[01:54:14.335 --> 01:54:21.219]  Do you think those fairy tales all over the world, no matter where, oh, don't get, I mean, in ancient China they said don't get near the castle, they'll kill you.
[01:54:21.239 --> 01:54:23.080]  Because that's who's in the damn castle!
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.781]  Do you want to get near Kim Jong Un's castle?
[01:54:24.801 --> 01:54:27.162]  What do you think happens?
[01:54:41.144 --> 01:54:42.985]  They are evil.
[01:54:43.145 --> 01:54:44.606]  They are inbred psychos.
[01:54:44.986 --> 01:54:50.289]  And you start breeding psycho after psycho together, you get inbred lunatic maniacs.
[01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:54.572]  I don't care if they're black, white, I don't care if they're Asian, it's the same thing.
[01:54:55.112 --> 01:54:58.134]  The Aztecs started interbreeding, created a lunatic group at the top.
[01:55:00.575 --> 01:55:02.056]  So many of these cultures have done it.
[01:55:02.677 --> 01:55:06.159]  And what you create is a hyper-predatory maniac demon.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.701]  All right, enough of me.
[01:55:10.762 --> 01:55:18.424]  We've got Joe and Preston and Sunshine and Tom and Andrew and Colin and Steve and Joe and Sarah and Michael.
[01:55:18.964 --> 01:55:26.526]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sunshine and Austin because the blizzard's back and they're saying the blackouts may last a month or just forever.
[01:55:26.546 --> 01:55:28.066]  It's just get used to it.
[01:55:28.106 --> 01:55:28.726]  It's for the earth.
[01:55:28.746 --> 01:55:29.626]  What are they calling it?
[01:55:30.486 --> 01:55:32.487]  They're calling it the climate lockdowns.
[01:55:33.387 --> 01:55:36.328]  Yes, there's Prince Charles' father, a very friendly person.
[01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:38.531]  Would you like to have both for babysitting?
[01:55:38.851 --> 01:55:42.374]  Here, let's go ahead and go to Sunshine.
[01:55:42.414 --> 01:55:43.175]  Sunshine, welcome!
[01:55:43.916 --> 01:55:44.496]  Sunshine!
[01:55:44.616 --> 01:55:45.417]  Oh my god, yes!
[01:55:45.457 --> 01:55:47.219]  Hi Alex, I love you so much!
[01:55:47.339 --> 01:55:49.220]  I am a super fan, oh my goodness!
[01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:50.621]  Well, I'm a fan of you!
[01:55:50.642 --> 01:55:51.582]  Thanks for getting on the air.
[01:55:51.602 --> 01:55:55.766]  What's your view on the situation on our little Lord Urquhart, the little baby Enron?
[01:55:56.386 --> 01:55:58.508]  Oh my god, listen, it's all a scam.
[01:55:58.568 --> 01:56:01.130]  Like, okay, I'm a millennial first and foremost.
[01:56:01.291 --> 01:56:02.612]  I am biracial.
[01:56:03.212 --> 01:56:04.534]  I want to say the race war is fake.
[01:56:04.594 --> 01:56:07.277]  I want to say Alex Jones is not a racist, okay?
[01:56:07.317 --> 01:56:07.917]  We love him.
[01:56:08.558 --> 01:56:09.599]  Well, I am a racist.
[01:56:09.679 --> 01:56:10.580]  I'm pro-human race.
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:12.242]  I'm actually pro-human.
[01:56:12.262 --> 01:56:12.603]  Hey!
[01:56:13.163 --> 01:56:14.064]  All lives matter!
[01:56:14.164 --> 01:56:14.985]  Let's go!
[01:56:15.085 --> 01:56:16.427]  Let's get it straight, okay?
[01:56:17.376 --> 01:56:22.703]  Um, anyway, so like, I, like, have not been on TikTok, but I just made a TikTok and I started posting.
[01:56:23.224 --> 01:56:29.211]  I saw this thing where they were taking the snow and, like, trying to light it on fire and, like, to see if it would melt like normal snow.
[01:56:29.231 --> 01:56:30.413]  I tried it out.
[01:56:30.493 --> 01:56:31.013]  Oh, my God.
[01:56:31.053 --> 01:56:33.517]  This horrible chemical smell was coming from the snow.
[01:56:33.537 --> 01:56:34.858]  It's totally fake.
[01:56:34.898 --> 01:56:35.940]  It's like this weird,
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.280]  Well, let me say this.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:39.841]  Weather modification is as real as a heart attack.
[01:56:39.921 --> 01:56:40.441]  It's giant.
[01:56:40.461 --> 01:56:42.021]  All these big governments are doing it.
[01:57:01.465 --> 01:57:04.066]  And then we've had all this unusual weather on the West Coast.
[01:57:04.126 --> 01:57:05.347]  We've talked to meteorologists there.
[01:57:05.367 --> 01:57:07.968]  They believe that they artificially blocked the water.
[01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:11.090]  Russia believed they were under weather attack a few years ago.
[01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.710]  China admits they're controlling weather.
[01:57:13.451 --> 01:57:16.632]  And you don't normally see arctic blasts like this coming down this far.
[01:57:16.652 --> 01:57:17.593]  And they can use HAARP.
[01:57:18.573 --> 01:57:22.115]  They can use HAARP to actually direct these jet streams and these solar vortexes.
[01:57:24.239 --> 01:57:28.742]  And I'm just like, I'm seeing it firsthand, you know, like actually living through this, not just reading about it.
[01:57:28.762 --> 01:57:38.168]  And I'm just like, oh my goodness, this is the start, the freaking New World Order, the Great Reset, you know, it's all a scam, all garbage, like I'm not standing for it.
[01:57:38.188 --> 01:57:41.831]  I am trying to like, you know, awaken other people like me.
[01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:43.972]  And you know, I support you so much.
[01:57:44.112 --> 01:57:44.792]  Love your show.
[01:57:44.832 --> 01:57:45.413]  It's fantastic.
[01:57:45.513 --> 01:57:46.594]  You crack me up.
[01:57:47.054 --> 01:57:48.535]  You tell the best jokes.
[01:57:48.555 --> 01:57:50.276]  I am just like laughing my ass off.
[01:57:50.536 --> 01:57:51.617]  My butt off.
[01:57:51.637 --> 01:57:52.937]  Sorry, I had to catch myself there.
[01:57:53.678 --> 01:57:55.158]  You know, like, oh my goodness.
[01:57:55.258 --> 01:57:55.999]  I just, I'm so happy.
[01:57:56.019 --> 01:57:58.500]  Sunshine, you got the right name.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.021]  You are just bubbling sunshine.
[01:58:00.041 --> 01:58:01.381]  Just make me happy talking to you.
[01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:03.943]  Call us again and we love you and we appreciate you and have a great day.
[01:58:04.663 --> 01:58:06.224]  Let me tell you what's going on with the snow, folks.
[01:58:06.364 --> 01:58:07.544]  Is there chemicals in the air?
[01:58:08.205 --> 01:58:11.786]  Are we where the jet stream out of China dumps in over Texas, unfortunately?
[01:58:12.207 --> 01:58:13.267]  Is there a lot of toxic stuff?
[01:58:13.347 --> 01:58:14.308]  Is there geoengineering going on?
[01:58:14.348 --> 01:58:14.728]  Absolutely.
[01:58:15.028 --> 01:58:16.989]  But let me explain what's happening with propane fire.
[01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:18.698]  That's
[01:58:38.926 --> 01:58:42.789]  But the way that works is the snow is in flakes, so it's not compacted.
[01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:48.695]  As soon as you start burning it, all it does is melt into the ice and it concentrates it.
[01:58:48.715 --> 01:58:51.958]  So you've got to go ahead and finish melting all the way down in the pot to do that.
[01:58:52.259 --> 01:58:55.201]  That's the most viral videos out there is everybody saying the snow is fake.
[01:58:55.542 --> 01:58:56.523]  I can tell you it's not fake.
[01:58:57.063 --> 01:59:00.326]  Stop putting chemicals in the air that make the snow gay!
[01:59:01.067 --> 01:59:01.427]  Fuck!
[01:59:01.648 --> 01:59:02.888]  The snow's gay!
[01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:03.729]  Stop it!
[01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:04.890]  The snow's gay!
[01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:06.371]  They're controlling it!
[01:59:06.411 --> 01:59:08.212]  Bill Gates is making the snow gay!
[01:59:08.532 --> 01:59:10.914]  And it's white, so it's racist!
[01:59:11.234 --> 01:59:12.015]  Racist snow!
[01:59:12.455 --> 01:59:15.337]  That was a fake rant, and no, the snow's not gay.
[01:59:15.798 --> 01:59:17.159]  But that'll be meme treasure.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.921]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:59:21.342 --> 01:59:22.102]  Okay, this is enough.
[01:59:23.263 --> 01:59:29.828]  I made the joke about gay snow, and I guess they found, they searched the term gay snow, and that's what it is.
[01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:44.442]  I mean, obviously, I was talking about the chemicals in the water that do make the frogs become bisexual, or I guess you'd say, well, they don't want the females anymore, so they try to fertilize, not as just an egg, and then they die.
[01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:48.313]  And the globalists do promote homosexuality so that people don't have children anymore.
[01:59:48.333 --> 01:59:49.093]  That's why they promote it.
[01:59:49.394 --> 01:59:53.397]  I don't hate the individual people that are involved in those things.
[01:59:53.457 --> 01:59:54.418]  I'm not a hateful person.
[01:59:54.819 --> 01:59:59.003]  But I will tell you, it is designed to make sure that you're married to the state and married to the system.
[01:59:59.063 --> 02:00:01.785]  And it is a globalist ploy to end the family unit.
[02:00:01.885 --> 02:00:09.232]  And now the whole liberal movement is attacking the family and is attacking young, handicapped boys, telling them they're transgender as part of a larger sterilization project.
[02:00:09.492 --> 02:00:11.054]  And that's come out even in the British Parliament.
[02:00:11.794 --> 02:00:17.057]  So, the whole vehicle of, oh, we're for rights in America and we're for rights in the West is being used against us.
[02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:23.941]  And then when China runs death camps, Joe Biden goes, that's just cultural to run death camps and put Christians and Muslims and Buddhists in camps.
[02:00:23.961 --> 02:00:26.182]  The left's like, yeah, that's a cultural thing.
[02:00:26.202 --> 02:00:30.965]  And, you know, General Idio Ray that wants to have war with the American people, he just thinks that's fine too.
[02:00:32.571 --> 02:00:35.674]  I would like to promote Amendment 9 and Amendment 10 to the Constitution.
[02:01:00.058 --> 02:01:11.949]  And as a former resident of Texas with five native-born Texas children, I have a connection and a heart for the people in Texas that are suffering right now.
[02:01:12.529 --> 02:01:23.599]  Now, no one can show me in the Constitution where it says that the federal government has the right to turn off the power and shut down power plants.
[02:01:24.352 --> 02:01:26.936]  Nor touch the Second Amendment.
[02:01:26.956 --> 02:01:29.219]  It says, shall not be in print.
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:38.591]  And both the Ninth and Tenth Amendment end up saying that these are rights retained by the people.
[02:01:39.172 --> 02:01:39.592]  No, you're right.
[02:01:39.612 --> 02:01:46.158]  The 9th and 10th Amendment point out that all rights that are not even expressly stated still exist and are reserved by the people.
[02:01:46.558 --> 02:01:47.499]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:01:47.979 --> 02:01:50.161]  For those that don't know, they admittedly turned the power off.
[02:01:50.181 --> 02:01:51.342]  They admittedly had plenty of power.
[02:01:51.622 --> 02:01:58.388]  They did this literally to jack up prices and to create a crisis to make Texas look bad and have the feds come in and take it over and put smart meters in.
[02:01:58.688 --> 02:01:59.449]  You're totally right.
[02:01:59.489 --> 02:02:01.751]  So Texas needs to declare the 10th Amendment.
[02:02:02.031 --> 02:02:03.691]  New Hampshire has it in its constitution.
[02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:04.992]  It's called the right to revolt.
[02:02:05.372 --> 02:02:08.473]  And all we've got to do is say, we're not part of your system.
[02:02:08.813 --> 02:02:12.573]  And that means you've got to kick ERCOT, that's a bunch of globalists, out of the control.
[02:02:12.634 --> 02:02:13.554]  They are the problem.
[02:02:15.154 --> 02:02:19.775]  Thank you very much for bringing that out and underscoring it.
[02:02:20.355 --> 02:02:25.517]  Now, the Texas state legislature has been good about a lot of things.
[02:02:25.897 --> 02:02:31.538]  But the Texas state legislator needs to take the forefront
[02:02:32.469 --> 02:02:49.792]  I totally agree, and for those that don't know, coal is so great because it's so clean, there's so much of it.
[02:02:50.052 --> 02:02:54.573]  You can put little coal stations all over and power little neighborhoods, big cities, small towns.
[02:02:54.953 --> 02:03:01.154]  Then if they want to tie into a larger grid in agreements to share power, but then when they need it, they can dial back and keep their power.
[02:03:01.514 --> 02:03:08.978]  Under ERCOT, we went under, like California's been done for 30 years, the control of a private multinational group that's playing all sorts of games.
[02:03:09.218 --> 02:03:13.380]  And our prices have exploded, the quality's gone down, and this is how these guys do it.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.160]  It's dirty pool.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:19.803]  Just like they rigged the stock market with flash trading and, you know, instant trading, they're doing the same damn thing right now.
[02:03:21.084 --> 02:03:22.564]  Let's tell it like it is.
[02:03:23.125 --> 02:03:27.587]  We're dealing with criminally insane traders.
[02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.168]  They are worse than traders.
[02:03:30.228 --> 02:03:31.248]  They're satanists.
[02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:37.691]  They are, and imagine for them, when they see an industry that's running and good, they just go, let's just screw that over and steal that.
[02:03:37.731 --> 02:03:38.211]  That's easy.
[02:03:38.452 --> 02:03:40.132]  And so they make money out of fraud.
[02:03:40.152 --> 02:03:41.253]  That's how you get a third world country.
[02:03:42.398 --> 02:03:42.738]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:43.919 --> 02:03:48.543]  I truly appreciate your giving me the opportunity to express these things.
[02:03:48.984 --> 02:03:51.826]  And I know that you're a Tenth Amendment man.
[02:03:52.346 --> 02:03:55.109]  And the Ninth Amendment is just as important.
[02:03:55.329 --> 02:03:57.131]  Yeah, tell folks about the Ninth Amendment that don't know.
[02:03:57.151 --> 02:03:58.732]  Guys, pull up both the Ninth and the Tenth Amendment.
[02:03:58.892 --> 02:04:01.955]  Because those are both, those are just as important as the Second Amendment and the First.
[02:04:02.799 --> 02:04:17.507]  Yes, it says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people.
[02:04:17.527 --> 02:04:19.728]  Oh my gosh, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:04:19.768 --> 02:04:20.289]  God bless you.
[02:04:21.343 --> 02:04:22.263]  Put that back on screen.
[02:04:22.524 --> 02:04:23.644]  I told you there's hundreds of these.
[02:04:24.265 --> 02:04:24.605]  So many.
[02:04:24.825 --> 02:04:25.765]  I've probably seen a hundred today.
[02:04:26.166 --> 02:04:26.946]  Texas sucks.
[02:04:27.006 --> 02:04:28.207]  Texas isn't exceptional.
[02:04:28.487 --> 02:04:29.387]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[02:04:29.447 --> 02:04:30.008]  And there it is.
[02:04:30.388 --> 02:04:30.868]  Opinion.
[02:04:30.928 --> 02:04:35.150]  It's time to bury the myth of Texas exceptionalism, Jeff Bezos says.
[02:04:36.231 --> 02:04:47.477]  So they come in and shut down over a hundred of our coal power plants, make us go off on windmills, then don't winterize the nuclear power plant, this ERCOT criminal group run by a bunch of liberals on record, and then they blame us!
[02:04:48.646 --> 02:04:49.327]  They blame us?
[02:04:49.847 --> 02:04:54.532]  Just like they're blaming the power outage on using too much power or everybody turning their faucets on.
[02:04:54.572 --> 02:04:55.693]  That's why we ran out of water.
[02:04:55.974 --> 02:04:56.234]  No!
[02:04:56.634 --> 02:04:58.877]  The power went out at the damn water treatment plants!
[02:04:58.897 --> 02:04:59.998]  That's why there wasn't water!
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:09.027]  People need to tell Biden, the criminal, and the federal government
[02:05:09.625 --> 02:05:12.391]  That we don't have to listen to them.
[02:05:12.411 --> 02:05:18.685]  His executive orders and their evil machinations of EPA and all the rest
[02:05:19.392 --> 02:05:24.517]  You can't find it in the Constitution and our rights are retained.
[02:05:24.938 --> 02:05:25.619]  You're absolutely right.
[02:05:25.659 --> 02:05:26.239]  God bless you.
[02:05:26.519 --> 02:05:27.881]  We can't let them hold us hostage.
[02:05:28.542 --> 02:05:31.845]  They're going to all make it about how Ircots are idiots and how Texas are idiots.
[02:05:31.885 --> 02:05:34.027]  This was a globalist operation.
[02:05:34.047 --> 02:05:34.968]  We told you it was coming.
[02:05:35.008 --> 02:05:35.889]  They've done it in California.
[02:05:35.909 --> 02:05:36.690]  I have all the articles.
[02:05:37.210 --> 02:05:38.772]  Enron linked to California blackouts.
[02:05:38.812 --> 02:05:39.413]  That's 18 years old.
[02:05:40.754 --> 02:05:44.317]  Where they, it all came out, it was all documentaries were made, books were written.
[02:05:44.598 --> 02:05:46.219]  They did it on purpose.
[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:48.201]  They did it on purpose.
[02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:49.022]  They did it.
[02:05:49.262 --> 02:05:51.544]  They do rolling blackouts to prepare you for higher prices.
[02:05:51.885 --> 02:05:54.507]  Now they're announcing prices up 10,000 times higher.
[02:05:54.587 --> 02:05:56.009]  I'm not joking, that's Reuters.
[02:05:56.529 --> 02:05:58.010]  Thank you, Joe in Indiana.
[02:05:58.471 --> 02:06:00.393]  All right, who's been holding the longest necks now?
[02:06:01.354 --> 02:06:03.015]  That would be Preston in Pennsylvania.
[02:06:03.035 --> 02:06:03.636]  Preston, welcome.
[02:06:05.385 --> 02:06:06.546]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:06:06.727 --> 02:06:20.039]  I was just trying to brainstorm listening to everything you said over the last 20 to 30 minutes and I wouldn't see it being a long forethought to say that, well, the power is already, you know, having rolling blackouts in Texas.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.403]  Why not, you know, cooperate with other groups like ERCOT?
[02:06:24.705 --> 02:06:32.529]  Yeah, why don't we give the rolling blackouts to New York run by liberals?
[02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:34.651]  I don't want to hurt the New Yorkers, they need it, but you know what I mean.
[02:06:34.671 --> 02:06:36.091]  How about all the rich areas?
[02:06:36.592 --> 02:06:39.813]  Instead of those being essential and staying on, all the rich areas staying on.
[02:06:39.993 --> 02:06:43.155]  How about the rich people have their power turned off, okay?
[02:06:43.415 --> 02:06:44.496]  And then how about D.C.
[02:06:44.536 --> 02:06:45.476]  have its power turned off?
[02:06:45.796 --> 02:06:46.677]  Oh no, they're essential!
[02:06:48.479 --> 02:06:54.023]  Yeah, I mean, they have it set up right now to where Texas, like you said, they know they're making Texas the scapegoat for all of this.
[02:06:54.263 --> 02:07:08.353]  And they could very easily continue using Texas as a scapegoat, push this agenda forward and, you know, and this and all the other surrounding states, and continue the rolling blackouts from Texas and use Texas as a scapegoat for it all to, you know, soil Texas's name.
[02:07:08.894 --> 02:07:12.836]  And then say, okay, yeah, well now everybody's worried about power and the cold weather and all that.
[02:07:12.936 --> 02:07:16.299]  Now you're not focusing on the COVID, you know, hoax as it is.
[02:07:16.946 --> 02:07:24.547]  And all the other politics that are going to come out here in the next week or so, you know, with the Democrats being behind the agent provocateurs in D.C.
[02:07:26.028 --> 02:07:26.388]  That's right.
[02:07:26.428 --> 02:07:28.908]  And the left admits it's a battle to blame Texas.
[02:07:28.968 --> 02:07:30.909]  No, you put in the windmills that don't work.
[02:07:30.969 --> 02:07:33.229]  You shut down over 100 Texas plants.
[02:07:33.489 --> 02:07:34.649]  We told you it would happen.
[02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:35.550]  You did it.
[02:07:35.730 --> 02:07:37.290]  You are the problem.
[02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:38.410]  It shut down Spain.
[02:07:38.730 --> 02:07:40.891]  Spain has been in a 10-year depression from the damn windmills.
[02:07:41.091 --> 02:07:42.351]  They shut all their coal plants off.
[02:07:45.576 --> 02:08:03.485]  It's a travesty, I mean, and the sad thing is that the average person who just wants to go to work on a Monday to Friday, 40-hour work week, you know, just get by with the economics, all the bills, now you gotta worry about your power being shut off, you know, not being able to put food on your table for the folks, you know, that can't even go to the grocery stores due to logistics breakdowns.
[02:08:04.206 --> 02:08:12.270]  And this is only the beginning if people don't start to see that, you know, that there are evil people in control, and they don't have the general folks' best interests in mind.
[02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.971]  They say
[02:08:15.259 --> 02:08:16.900]  Extinction Rebellion, Bill Gates, all of them.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:17.741]  No more plants.
[02:08:17.781 --> 02:08:19.262]  They say get used to not having power.
[02:08:19.282 --> 02:08:23.685]  In fact, they propose that you don't have power for eight o'clock at night and that they control your thermostat.
[02:08:23.725 --> 02:08:24.385]  It's already here.
[02:08:24.765 --> 02:08:25.446]  God bless you, brother.
[02:08:25.466 --> 02:08:26.166]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:26.206 --> 02:08:26.727]  Great callers.
[02:08:27.107 --> 02:08:29.969]  OK, I'm going to start the next hour, take calls again, whole next hour.
[02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:39.275]  But I do have to spend some time at the bottom of the hours, I promise, to just read the headlines off all these stories, because I mean, I don't just get up here and blame the globalists and ERCOT for this.
[02:08:39.675 --> 02:08:45.019]  But notice the media is like ERCOT is Texas because ERCOT, you know, is the Texas Reliability Program.
[02:08:46.739 --> 02:08:51.640]  You look at who bought up our water districts, who controls everything, and it's these multinational corporations.
[02:08:52.081 --> 02:08:54.981]  I mean, hell, the King of Spain owns our main toll roads.
[02:08:55.441 --> 02:09:00.322]  And my whole thing is, what is the King of Spain doing coming in here, Juan Carlos, and, you know, doing all this?
[02:09:00.362 --> 02:09:02.383]  So we've been through this.
[02:09:03.343 --> 02:09:11.685]  This is what globalism is, where they own the companies, they own the businesses, they own the banks, they own the airlines, and they say, we don't care what your president says.
[02:09:13.237 --> 02:09:14.178]  You're not going to travel.
[02:09:14.218 --> 02:09:14.878]  You're not going to live.
[02:09:14.898 --> 02:09:15.558]  You're not essential.
[02:09:15.959 --> 02:09:17.820]  And they hold you hostage.
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:19.881]  So there's where the libertarians are wrong.
[02:09:19.901 --> 02:09:21.402]  They're like, hey, privatize everything.
[02:09:22.963 --> 02:09:27.606]  The private monopolies form combines and then create something worse than a Soviet state.
[02:09:28.687 --> 02:09:33.830]  So you got to have a balance between the two, but you really got to have informed, vigilant people that stand up for themselves and say, hell no.
[02:09:34.150 --> 02:09:35.471]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:09:35.511 --> 02:09:36.552]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:09:39.798 --> 02:09:40.398]  All right, folks.
[02:09:41.279 --> 02:09:43.019]  Some stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[02:09:43.119 --> 02:09:45.460]  I'm going to play a very important report, premiere it here.
[02:09:46.001 --> 02:09:53.223]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come right back with Jess, who's a third-generation physician and has seen deaths from COVID vaccine.
[02:09:53.243 --> 02:09:54.124]  That's what it says on the board.
[02:09:54.564 --> 02:09:55.284]  We know it's happening.
[02:09:55.304 --> 02:09:56.385]  We know they're trying to suppress it.
[02:09:56.745 --> 02:10:00.186]  I can't wait to talk to this physician and get their take when we come back.
[02:10:00.686 --> 02:10:02.967]  I wasn't reading the call comments properly.
[02:10:02.987 --> 02:10:03.808]  I would have gone to you first.
[02:10:03.848 --> 02:10:04.408]  I apologize.
[02:10:04.748 --> 02:10:06.249]  We'll go to Jess in South Carolina here in a moment.
[02:10:06.949 --> 02:10:08.091]  This is a viral video.
[02:10:08.472 --> 02:10:11.598]  It's already gotten hundreds of thousands of views online, not just at Bandai Video.
[02:10:11.899 --> 02:10:13.041]  It was put out last night.
[02:10:13.301 --> 02:10:14.945]  People are having a fun time with it.
[02:10:15.406 --> 02:10:17.149]  I've gone over to ERCOT in South Austin.
[02:10:17.169 --> 02:10:18.251]  We're going to be protesting on...
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:39.250]  Saturday, this Enron, globalist, German-Canadian company, and most people on the board are foreign now, we're not, just not in Texas, it should be illegal to be in charge of critical infrastructure, and I'm driving back down the access road, there's a Wendy's over there, and everybody's waving, most people like me, but this guy goes, if you, I'll kick your ass, stuff like that, I saw one of you come down here, you know.
[02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:41.851]  So I went and parked and went over to him, not to get in a fight with him.
[02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:44.232]  I'm like, hey, big man, get out and tell me where I'm wrong.
[02:10:44.653 --> 02:10:49.275]  He's a Californian with California plates running from the hell that he brought down with him.
[02:10:49.515 --> 02:10:51.096]  And he's pissed at me because I'm Alex Jones.
[02:10:51.356 --> 02:10:51.736]  Here it is.
[02:10:51.756 --> 02:11:01.481]  The Great Reset is here to starve you and exploit you and hurt you!
[02:11:01.962 --> 02:11:04.683]  InfoWars.com!
[02:11:04.763 --> 02:11:05.844]  InfoWars.com!
[02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:18.461]  All of you know that these lockdowns aren't ever going to end and this is just part of the lockdowns.
[02:11:19.482 --> 02:11:20.763]  This is part of the control.
[02:11:22.184 --> 02:11:34.292]  And until you wake up to the fact that you're under technocracy attack, God bless you brother, until you wake up to that, it's only going to get worse!
[02:11:34.552 --> 02:11:37.234]  We're not looking for trouble.
[02:11:38.362 --> 02:11:40.905]  But I was driving by from the ERCOT place that turned our power off.
[02:11:41.786 --> 02:11:42.887]  And the most people were waving at us.
[02:11:43.427 --> 02:11:43.968]  They're listeners.
[02:11:43.988 --> 02:11:44.308]  We love them.
[02:11:44.668 --> 02:11:46.310]  This guy jumped out of his car and was flipping us off.
[02:11:46.350 --> 02:11:46.711]  So come here.
[02:11:46.731 --> 02:11:47.892]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:11:47.912 --> 02:11:49.614]  I'm going to go talk to him and see if he can actually talk.
[02:11:49.634 --> 02:11:50.094]  Let's go over here.
[02:11:51.956 --> 02:11:53.337]  How you doing, brother?
[02:11:53.477 --> 02:11:54.178]  Good work, man.
[02:11:54.258 --> 02:11:54.819]  We're trying, brother.
[02:11:54.859 --> 02:11:55.700]  Have I met you before?
[02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:57.161]  I don't think so.
[02:11:57.181 --> 02:11:57.862]  Well, good luck, brother.
[02:11:57.882 --> 02:11:58.843]  I haven't seen you for years.
[02:11:58.883 --> 02:11:59.363]  We're trying, brother.
[02:12:05.555 --> 02:12:07.116]  Hey, those are cool dogs.
[02:12:07.176 --> 02:12:08.136]  Bull Terrier.
[02:12:08.156 --> 02:12:09.717]  Remember which one it was?
[02:12:10.037 --> 02:12:12.338]  Oh yeah, it's this.
[02:12:14.039 --> 02:12:15.440]  We love you!
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:17.401]  Death to the low water!
[02:12:18.561 --> 02:12:19.362]  Hey, we're here!
[02:12:19.382 --> 02:12:24.884]  Are you able to talk other than your one IQ point?
[02:12:24.904 --> 02:12:27.286]  You like the power cutoff?
[02:12:27.346 --> 02:12:30.287]  You like Enron running these scams?
[02:12:30.387 --> 02:12:31.107]  It's Enron 2.0!
[02:12:31.388 --> 02:12:33.289]  Or are you too stupid?
[02:12:33.309 --> 02:12:33.889]  So, here I am.
[02:12:35.206 --> 02:12:39.268]  Oh, you're a big man.
[02:12:39.348 --> 02:12:41.169]  You're a big man.
[02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:42.490]  You like Ircon?
[02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.970]  You like Enron?
[02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:44.611]  You like old folks freezing to death?
[02:12:45.271 --> 02:12:46.491]  You like being lined up in Wendy's?
[02:12:46.512 --> 02:12:47.772]  You fucking, you know, liberal?
[02:12:48.232 --> 02:12:48.973]  You authoritarian?
[02:12:49.013 --> 02:12:50.593]  You're not a liberal.
[02:12:51.434 --> 02:12:52.614]  Check it out.
[02:12:52.795 --> 02:12:53.135]  Come here.
[02:12:53.155 --> 02:12:54.095]  Oh yeah, look at you, man.
[02:12:54.175 --> 02:12:54.675]  Oh, you're so tough.
[02:12:54.755 --> 02:12:55.256]  Look at you.
[02:12:56.271 --> 02:12:57.551]  Hey, you gonna take your vaccines?
[02:12:57.651 --> 02:12:59.912]  You gonna get all your little travel passes?
[02:12:59.932 --> 02:13:00.733]  Hey, you flipped us off?
[02:13:00.793 --> 02:13:02.633]  They're probably lying saying we came over to you.
[02:13:03.073 --> 02:13:05.334]  You flipped us off and you asked for it.
[02:13:05.434 --> 02:13:08.635]  Are you even, are you even, oh yeah, you bet I, I question public events.
[02:13:08.675 --> 02:13:10.636]  Am I running death camps in China like Apple?
[02:13:11.576 --> 02:13:13.557]  Are you upset about Apple running death camps in China?
[02:13:13.717 --> 02:13:14.677]  Or you like Xi Jinping?
[02:13:15.557 --> 02:13:16.518]  Get his little snake face.
[02:13:17.538 --> 02:13:19.279]  Look at this guy's snake face, man.
[02:13:19.319 --> 02:13:21.039]  Wannabe intellectual, total loser.
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:24.380]  And he sits there and acts tough and flips people off.
[02:13:24.561 --> 02:13:25.561]  So here I am, big guy.
[02:13:28.382 --> 02:13:29.903]  Hey, listen, listen, I'm not trying to make you fear me.
[02:13:29.923 --> 02:13:30.783]  You're the one flipping me off.
[02:13:31.123 --> 02:13:37.146]  I'm not here warning people about who turned... You know about Enron turning the power off and running blackouts and scams?
[02:13:37.646 --> 02:13:38.347]  Enron?
[02:13:38.427 --> 02:13:38.647]  Enron!
[02:13:38.687 --> 02:13:39.867]  You don't know what Enron is?
[02:13:40.147 --> 02:13:41.588]  Because you're such a... No, no.
[02:13:41.608 --> 02:13:42.688]  Because they got caught.
[02:13:43.449 --> 02:13:44.429]  You know what Ercot is.
[02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.530]  Get his face.
[02:13:46.590 --> 02:13:47.451]  Look at him.
[02:13:47.471 --> 02:13:48.731]  He's so stupid.
[02:13:49.632 --> 02:13:51.713]  But he thinks he's got a fake degree or whatever.
[02:13:51.733 --> 02:13:52.193]  He's smart.
[02:13:52.653 --> 02:13:54.394]  Dude, you're a chump of the shy cops, man.
[02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:56.430]  And so, hey, hey!
[02:13:57.330 --> 02:14:00.632]  You flipped me off, you jumped out of your car, I came over here to talk to you.
[02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:01.292]  Here I am.
[02:14:02.633 --> 02:14:02.773]  Okay?
[02:14:03.153 --> 02:14:05.594]  So, I'm here to talk to you.
[02:14:05.614 --> 02:14:08.036]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Man.Video.
[02:14:08.296 --> 02:14:10.337]  Here we are, fighting, fighting.
[02:14:10.357 --> 02:14:11.478]  Yeah, always fighting terror.
[02:14:11.498 --> 02:14:11.858]  That's right.
[02:14:12.138 --> 02:14:13.299]  Always going up against the system.
[02:14:13.559 --> 02:14:14.679]  Always fighting for poor people.
[02:14:14.919 --> 02:14:16.000]  Always standing up for energy.
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.421]  Always standing up for the Republic.
[02:14:18.381 --> 02:14:20.903]  So you like trying to run a death dance, and then Apple loves it.
[02:14:20.923 --> 02:14:22.123]  Yeah, you love it, you piece of crap.
[02:14:23.544 --> 02:14:24.765]  You got what you wanted, big man!
[02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.890]  You got what you wanted.
[02:14:27.931 --> 02:14:28.913]  Down with Erskine!
[02:14:29.914 --> 02:14:30.254]  Erskine!
[02:14:45.689 --> 02:14:53.296]  And Jess is calling in from South Carolina, says that they are a third-gen physician, has known of deaths from COVID vaccine.
[02:14:53.316 --> 02:14:58.800]  I want to be clear, if you talk about deaths from the COVID vaccine on Facebook, Twitter, anywhere, they'll try to ban you.
[02:14:59.281 --> 02:15:03.824]  Even though I'm punch drunk from it, every day without looking,
[02:15:04.653 --> 02:15:08.135]  There's like, oh, three people died at this nursing home after they gave it.
[02:15:08.515 --> 02:15:11.216]  Fifteen died here, five died there, seven died here.
[02:15:11.556 --> 02:15:15.398]  You know, Sweden suspends vaccine after 23 die at one facility.
[02:15:16.038 --> 02:15:21.561]  And you just, Australia suspends vaccines after death, and you just read the stacks of news.
[02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:28.764]  But you notice it's always clusters, because there's only certain hospitals and nursing homes that have good physicians and good people that report it.
[02:15:30.396 --> 02:15:35.365]  And of course, it's very obvious, because a lot of these people die very, very, very quickly.
[02:15:36.768 --> 02:15:38.751]  We're talking 5, 10, 15 minutes, I have to tell you.
[02:15:38.812 --> 02:15:41.256]  Others, a few hours, a day later, a week later.
[02:15:42.375 --> 02:15:42.695]  I don't know.
[02:16:03.306 --> 02:16:04.907]  And it's totally experimental.
[02:16:04.927 --> 02:16:06.787]  It's saying the president, whatever they want, whenever they want.
[02:16:07.227 --> 02:16:09.968]  South Africa has suspended the mRNA vaccine, another type.
[02:16:10.568 --> 02:16:12.329]  Again, Australia had their national vaccine.
[02:16:12.349 --> 02:16:13.129]  They suspended that one.
[02:16:13.309 --> 02:16:16.230]  It's a false HIV positive test and illnesses and deaths.
[02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:21.652]  We have Merck pulling its vaccines a month ago, saying that they don't help and that it's all a lie.
[02:16:21.912 --> 02:16:26.653]  We have leaked video of Zuckerberg saying that it's experimental and dangerous and he doesn't trust us.
[02:16:26.873 --> 02:16:28.854]  But, oh, if you say that on the platform, you're banned.
[02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:35.802]  So this is a crazy moment, and I appreciate Jess calling in to talk about what they've experienced and what they've seen.
[02:16:35.842 --> 02:16:36.903]  So Jess, thank you so much.
[02:16:38.453 --> 02:16:40.574]  Hi Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:16:40.594 --> 02:16:42.615]  I've actually been trying to get in for the last week.
[02:16:43.716 --> 02:16:45.497]  This is something that I don't typically do.
[02:16:45.537 --> 02:16:57.323]  I've never called into a show before, and it shows that I'm as impassioned as I am about this subject, that I'm potentially willing to risk my livelihood and potentially my license if someone finds out who exactly I am.
[02:16:57.383 --> 02:16:59.905]  So I have to be very careful with the identification.
[02:16:59.925 --> 02:17:02.926]  But under the Hippocratic Oath, you have a right and a duty to, so we appreciate you.
[02:17:03.087 --> 02:17:03.627]  Please continue.
[02:17:03.747 --> 02:17:04.027]  I do.
[02:17:04.247 --> 02:17:04.988]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:17:06.148 --> 02:17:11.351]  My experience with the COVID vaccine all along, so first of all, I'll give a little background about myself.
[02:17:11.411 --> 02:17:17.714]  I won't say exactly what I do because that will give too much identifying information, but I do have an Ivy League education.
[02:17:17.854 --> 02:17:20.195]  My medical degree is from an Ivy League institute.
[02:17:20.535 --> 02:17:24.217]  My parents are also Ivy League educated physicians, and so is my grandfather.
[02:17:24.657 --> 02:17:25.817]  My grandfather was married.
[02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:29.379]  They was now because my grandmother unfortunately passed away in the past week.
[02:17:30.039 --> 02:17:42.407]  To a woman who has been experiencing dementia for the last two years, has been in a care facility, but has otherwise been relatively stable, all things considered, still holding a conversation, still able to eat and drink with some assistance.
[02:17:42.968 --> 02:17:48.912]  She was vaccinated, unfortunately, by my grandfather's wishes approximately two and a half weeks ago.
[02:17:48.932 --> 02:17:54.976]  Half of our family is split on what we feel about this vaccine, given that, one, there has been no animal trial.
[02:17:55.676 --> 02:17:56.377]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:18.990]  We're good to go.
[02:18:39.921 --> 02:18:44.964]  And that's really the whole purpose of this, is to make sure that we are saving humanity and we are protecting humanity.
[02:18:45.304 --> 02:18:46.285]  So this is our background.
[02:18:46.445 --> 02:18:47.686]  My grandmother was vaccinated.
[02:18:47.726 --> 02:18:51.408]  I'm not sure with what vaccine, but was vaccinated about two and a half weeks ago.
[02:18:51.768 --> 02:18:56.131]  Within 48 hours, she described signs of lethargy, COVID-like signs.
[02:18:56.191 --> 02:18:59.853]  And because of that, she was put in a ward for COVID-like patients.
[02:18:59.913 --> 02:19:01.594]  She never tested positive for COVID.
[02:19:01.995 --> 02:19:08.819]  Because of this, she was not allowed appropriate access to food and water and basically starved to death and dehydrated to death.
[02:19:09.179 --> 02:19:11.662]  Because no one was coming in and feeding and watering her.
[02:19:12.423 --> 02:19:14.425]  Eventually she lost the ability to swallow.
[02:19:14.485 --> 02:19:16.948]  She aspirated and she died from aspiration pneumonia.
[02:19:17.468 --> 02:19:26.638]  I thought that this was potentially a unique situation until I spoke with my co-worker, who's also a physician, whose grandmother went through the same exact situation in another state.
[02:19:27.098 --> 02:19:29.341]  My grandmother was in the tri-state area up north.
[02:19:29.841 --> 02:19:31.323]  This woman's grandmother was in Virginia.
[02:19:34.155 --> 02:19:34.475]  I don't
[02:19:49.155 --> 02:19:49.636]  We're good to go.
[02:20:05.836 --> 02:20:11.843]  Well, just let me stop you and I'm going to give you the whole next segment, because I can tell you for real, I can tell you what you're talking about, but let me explain something.
[02:20:12.323 --> 02:20:23.475]  I'm no rocket scientist, but from Australia to the US, the UN said, don't let family and friends in, and then who gave them the directives to then not give these people aid once this happens?
[02:20:23.495 --> 02:20:24.557]  This is all a setup.
[02:20:25.317 --> 02:20:29.321]  They saved 600 million pounds already in the UK denying care to old people.
[02:20:29.681 --> 02:20:37.167]  Now The Guardian reports they're not giving mentally handicapped people access to regular medicine, claiming the hospitals are full when they're not.
[02:20:37.187 --> 02:20:42.752]  So this is all an exercise in rationed care, aka the death panels Bill Gates talked about.
[02:20:43.911 --> 02:20:44.651]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:20:44.671 --> 02:20:46.712]  You know, I will say I'm quite young.
[02:20:46.732 --> 02:21:01.157]  I will say that I only recently turned 30, so I've been listening to you through my parents for many, many years, most of my life, and I have tried to describe, quote-unquote, to be of what I thought was rational mind for so many years.
[02:21:01.177 --> 02:21:04.478]  I have so many things I thought were conspiracy theories, death panels.
[02:21:04.578 --> 02:21:06.919]  I'm like, oh, okay, you know, that's not totally true.
[02:21:06.959 --> 02:21:09.280]  You know, I do know that we ration care to some degree, but
[02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:12.724]  I can, I, I just cannot emphasize.
[02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:17.970]  Well sure, I mean, let's say if there's an earthquake and one person's gonna die for sure, you give the little kid that you can save.
[02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.451]  Absolutely.
[02:21:18.471 --> 02:21:19.292]  That's triage.
[02:21:19.572 --> 02:21:26.681]  But you don't just say, oh because of COVID, we're not gonna give mentally handicapped people aid when your hospital's half empty.
[02:21:26.901 --> 02:21:27.322]  It's evil.
[02:21:28.611 --> 02:21:36.199]  Absolutely, and you know, at least in my grandmother's case, we had family that was eventually able to go in and be with her in her last moment.
[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:42.946]  In my coworker's case, her family was only able to be with her because they fought this facility in Virginia to take her out.
[02:21:43.246 --> 02:21:48.291]  It was an incredible struggle to actually take her out of this facility when literally no one was taking care of her.
[02:21:48.551 --> 02:21:51.054]  They would put the food and water and her meds in her room
[02:21:51.474 --> 02:21:53.054]  But she was unable to do it herself.
[02:21:53.414 --> 02:21:56.275]  She was unable to give her medication or take her food or water.
[02:21:56.575 --> 02:22:00.836]  And you know that's incentivized because if they die, they get even more money.
[02:22:01.976 --> 02:22:02.496]  Absolutely.
[02:22:02.597 --> 02:22:17.960]  And so I, you know, again, I don't want to give out too much information, but my parents are practicing in a very high profile state in the country for between voter fraud and medical issues and certain people who are now working for the Biden administration who used to work for their state.
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:19.521]  Absolutely.
[02:22:19.682 --> 02:22:22.504]  My mother recently retired, but my father is still practicing.
[02:22:22.865 --> 02:22:34.337]  He tells stories almost every day of people who come in who are his patients, and they report that they work in care homes, they work in other places in the hospital, and they say, yeah, we've been seeing people drop like flies.
[02:22:35.398 --> 02:22:40.343]  Overall, people in general, I think when you actually speak with them and you talk to them about the actual facts,
[02:22:41.043 --> 02:22:51.010]  They seem to open up, and I had a situation actually recently at work where I lost it on the treatment floor, and I started talking about how, you know, we're all scientists here.
[02:22:51.030 --> 02:23:03.298]  We should understand that something that has been created in less than a year, it doesn't follow with the acceptable pattern of how we've created drugs and vaccines over the years, and yet we're taking these without animal trials.
[02:23:03.618 --> 02:23:04.138]  We are.
[02:23:04.538 --> 02:23:05.419]  Don't hang up, Jess.
[02:23:05.459 --> 02:23:06.940]  Come back and keep laying this out.
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.180]  But again, it's all pre-programmed.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:08.900]  It's lockstep.
[02:23:09.261 --> 02:23:09.941]  It's the UN.
[02:23:09.961 --> 02:23:11.482]  That's why it's all standardized worldwide.
[02:23:11.842 --> 02:23:13.683]  To overthrow the checks and balances.
[02:23:13.723 --> 02:23:15.183]  To overthrow the Hippocratic Oath.
[02:23:15.483 --> 02:23:16.944]  To overthrow medical testing.
[02:23:16.964 --> 02:23:18.145]  To overthrow due diligence.
[02:23:18.565 --> 02:23:25.428]  And to remove doctors and nurses from having any decision-making capacity because you see doctors and nurses on TV criticizing COVID.
[02:23:25.708 --> 02:23:29.151]  They're saying it's exaggerated, putting out treatments that work.
[02:23:29.451 --> 02:23:45.323]  They're being banned and they say because only the United Nations is allowed to tell us with their horrible record and the head of the WHO with what he did in Africa, covering up over a million dead there from cholera and more, which a lot of evidence shows they did on purpose.
[02:23:45.343 --> 02:23:47.284]  These are sinister eugenicists.
[02:23:47.965 --> 02:23:51.227]  China had the one-child policy, killed probably 100 million of their girls.
[02:23:51.928 --> 02:23:52.668]  The numbers vary.
[02:23:53.048 --> 02:23:54.850]  Folks, this is a eugenics plant.
[02:23:55.694 --> 02:23:57.856]  We're going to come back with Jess, who's a medical doctor.
[02:23:57.876 --> 02:23:58.396]  You can tell she is.
[02:23:58.436 --> 02:23:59.237]  She knows what she's talking about.
[02:23:59.557 --> 02:24:00.578]  You hear that passion.
[02:24:01.159 --> 02:24:03.060]  She signed up for this to help people, not kill them.
[02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:05.302]  All right, we'll be right back with Jess.
[02:24:05.363 --> 02:24:08.185]  And then after that segment, we'll talk to everybody else.
[02:24:08.245 --> 02:24:12.309]  Sarah, Michael, David, Colin, Andrew, Steve, Carlos.
[02:24:12.329 --> 02:24:13.410]  We're going to talk to everybody.
[02:24:13.430 --> 02:24:13.870]  Stay with us.
[02:24:16.412 --> 02:24:18.854]  Tomorrow, I want to do this for a while.
[02:24:18.914 --> 02:24:21.317]  I'm going to open up the entire broadcast, all four hours.
[02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:34.137]  To just take phone calls from medical personnel, doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, and others, and also family members can call in what they've experienced.
[02:24:34.477 --> 02:24:42.682]  Because here's the deal, we have a major aging population, one of the oldest in the world, other than like Italy or Japan, and they don't want to pay out all the money people put into the system.
[02:24:43.203 --> 02:24:44.724]  Bill Gates has said that, the banks have said it.
[02:24:45.244 --> 02:24:47.546]  So in the last year's lockdown or so,
[02:24:48.226 --> 02:24:53.269]  They've saved hundreds of billions of dollars on non-essential medical care, as they call it, which a lot of it was essential.
[02:24:53.289 --> 02:24:54.750]  And millions have died just in the U.S.
[02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:57.392]  of cancer, heart attacks, and other things that went untreated.
[02:24:57.412 --> 02:24:57.912]  That's been admitted.
[02:24:58.193 --> 02:24:58.833]  Same thing in Europe.
[02:24:59.273 --> 02:25:05.958]  Not just to mention the lockdown causing starvation in the third world, where a lot of folks spent half their income on just food.
[02:25:06.018 --> 02:25:09.120]  So suddenly, they're not working again at, say, a flower farm.
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:11.982]  That's one of the biggest things in Africa is growing flowers for people in Europe.
[02:25:12.022 --> 02:25:14.363]  In the U.S., you just go home and you starve to death.
[02:25:14.383 --> 02:25:14.964]  That's how it works.
[02:25:15.004 --> 02:25:15.744]  Like, oh, you got kids?
[02:25:16.025 --> 02:25:16.665]  There's no welfare.
[02:25:16.825 --> 02:25:18.026]  You just go home and you die.
[02:25:18.886 --> 02:25:23.229]  You get malnourished, a virus comes by, and you lose your kids or you die yourself.
[02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:23.929]  That's how it works.
[02:25:24.009 --> 02:25:30.813]  So, it's very Malthusian, it's very cold-blooded, and it's being done by the left, telling us how good they are and how great they are.
[02:25:30.833 --> 02:25:32.334]  This is not liberal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:32.654 --> 02:25:38.097]  This is authoritarian, it's Hitlerian, it's very dangerous, and it'll bite all of us in the ass as well.
[02:25:38.717 --> 02:25:42.119]  God's real, we'll be judged for it, but also, just read what you saw.
[02:25:42.179 --> 02:25:44.420]  You let this type of evil grow, it's going to hurt you too.
[02:25:46.121 --> 02:25:49.123]  We're losing our soul right now, but I don't just have to believe this medical doctor.
[02:25:49.283 --> 02:25:51.764]  I already know this, and I'm not pooh-poohing her calling in.
[02:25:51.864 --> 02:25:53.165]  You hear her upsetness.
[02:25:53.185 --> 02:25:54.385]  You hear her passion.
[02:25:54.425 --> 02:25:57.247]  That's normal if you're not a psychopath or a sociopath.
[02:25:59.207 --> 02:25:59.908]  But I can pull you up.
[02:25:59.928 --> 02:26:04.950]  The British Ministry of Defense came out a month ago, two months ago, and said, do not take it if you're over 75.
[02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:06.571]  We're seeing a lot of people die.
[02:26:07.331 --> 02:26:08.812]  And by the way, we're seeing a lot of miscarriages.
[02:26:08.852 --> 02:26:12.254]  Don't take it if you're below 16 or if you're pregnant.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:16.723]  And literally, you try to post that on Facebook, they'll ban it.
[02:26:16.743 --> 02:26:18.365]  So, Doc, we appreciate you.
[02:26:18.385 --> 02:26:19.426]  We appreciate your passion.
[02:26:19.746 --> 02:26:21.068]  Please continue to lay this out.
[02:26:21.088 --> 02:26:26.633]  And what happens when you point this out to your colleagues or to the nursing homes that you're not supposed to give this to above 75?
[02:26:26.753 --> 02:26:33.459]  Because clearly, of the mRNA Pfizer shots killing people in England and the UK, you shouldn't be doing it here, too.
[02:26:33.479 --> 02:26:36.542]  I mean, ask them, like, why did India just say no on this?
[02:26:36.782 --> 02:26:38.324]  I mean, what's going on here?
[02:26:39.682 --> 02:26:49.670]  Yeah, it's very interesting that you say that, because I think a lot of the hesitancy with medical professionals not speaking out more is this general group-think policy.
[02:26:50.171 --> 02:27:00.519]  I, again, don't want to say what colleges my family belongs to, but our journals come out, and the journals mostly anymore are about trans rights, social justice issues,
[02:27:00.919 --> 02:27:04.804]  Access to care, not about the actual, you know, field in and of itself.
[02:27:04.864 --> 02:27:05.204]  Exactly.
[02:27:05.364 --> 02:27:09.709]  All the fluffy fake liberal stuff is to divert from the reality of real science.
[02:27:10.672 --> 02:27:19.500]  Absolutely and so you know that's what we're being bombarded with and I feel like especially us younger people think that that's what we have to think we have to be in lockstep with these authorities.
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:34.072]  I will say though I was very proud it was with support staff so it wasn't necessarily my you know boarded colleagues but with my support staff when I said look I just I'm not anti-vaccine I walk around with a laminated card with all my vaccines on there in case something happens to me
[02:27:34.552 --> 02:27:35.594]  Yeah, I think
[02:27:50.011 --> 02:27:50.171]  Bingo!
[02:27:50.351 --> 02:27:52.632]  And you engaged in leadership, Jess, which is beautiful.
[02:27:52.672 --> 02:27:52.973]  Exactly.
[02:27:53.013 --> 02:27:54.193]  Please continue.
[02:28:09.864 --> 02:28:19.511]  Yeah, and I would say, overall, my other point that I wanted to make is, you know, for people who aren't physicians or who aren't in the medical field, please, I encourage everyone to speak up.
[02:28:19.591 --> 02:28:21.192]  I encourage people to look things up.
[02:28:21.232 --> 02:28:25.195]  I did want to bring up something that is very important and tangible in veterinary medicine.
[02:28:25.235 --> 02:28:27.337]  With our experience, well, I outed myself.
[02:28:27.637 --> 02:28:41.566]  With our experience with the coronavirus vaccine, which I'll bring up in a second, but please don't just look at your doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals as the absolute authority, because not everyone actually knows the studies here.
[02:28:42.126 --> 02:28:47.950]  I speak with plenty of people who are what I would consider to be brilliant people who act like they're brainwashed.
[02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:55.415]  I hate using that term because it's used too much, but they're completely brainwashed when you actually talk to them about, well, have you actually read what the studies were for these vaccines?
[02:28:55.435 --> 02:28:57.016]  Did you know that there were no animal trials?
[02:28:57.376 --> 02:29:01.078]  Did you know that it has this high rate of side effects?
[02:29:01.258 --> 02:29:03.059]  They actually don't know these things.
[02:29:03.119 --> 02:29:10.803]  That's right, and we've been told don't ask questions by big tech, but then we get Zuckerberg in a private conversation saying I don't trust this.
[02:29:11.877 --> 02:29:12.477]  Right, right.
[02:29:12.537 --> 02:29:19.442]  So it's very important to, you know, I hate it, such a 2020 kind of thing, do your own research, but it's absolutely true.
[02:29:19.482 --> 02:29:23.325]  And even if what you're seeing, maybe not the full truth, at least you're expanding your mind.
[02:29:23.365 --> 02:29:27.948]  Now, one thing I did want to bring up, which I think is important, and I haven't really heard many people talk about this,
[02:29:28.508 --> 02:29:29.149]  We're good to go.
[02:29:51.783 --> 02:29:52.183]  Yes, absolutely!
[02:30:15.564 --> 02:30:24.136]  They tried to make a vaccine specifically against this genetic mutation of the coronavirus that would mutate into feline infectious peritonitis, and they failed.
[02:30:24.216 --> 02:30:28.102]  They used it on many different cats, and if you actually look at the research, it says
[02:30:28.832 --> 02:30:34.875]  That we made this vaccine, we thought it was going to induce immunity, and instead it induced sensitivity.
[02:30:35.576 --> 02:30:39.398]  And that is very similar to what we're seeing with these coronavirus vaccines now.
[02:30:39.658 --> 02:30:42.540]  And take your time and explain that, because I'm not a medical doctor like you.
[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:50.324]  And I read Wolfgang Ruddard's report, and that former chief scientist, and I'm trying to understand it, but it says could turn your immune system way up, could turn it down.
[02:30:50.344 --> 02:30:51.104]  Absolutely.
[02:30:51.144 --> 02:30:52.325]  He says you can do all this stuff.
[02:30:53.484 --> 02:31:00.267]  Right, and with this particular vaccine, when I say that it induced sensitivity and not immunity, it was actually creating the virus.
[02:31:00.627 --> 02:31:03.409]  It was causing the mutation in these feline patients.
[02:31:03.829 --> 02:31:08.331]  So we were giving cats who didn't have this mutation, or that we knew of.
[02:31:08.371 --> 02:31:11.012]  Again, we don't know genetically if they were predisposed or not.
[02:31:11.532 --> 02:31:14.574]  Sure, but they gave them the vaccine and then the cells replicated it.
[02:31:15.646 --> 02:31:17.808]  Yes, and an induced feline infectious peritonitis.
[02:31:18.209 --> 02:31:21.372]  And I have personal experience with this and a personal cat.
[02:31:21.772 --> 02:31:26.276]  And we remember back in the 90s when this happened, we called down to a university to talk to them about it.
[02:31:26.557 --> 02:31:29.780]  They said, we actually don't give this vaccine anymore because we think it causes FI.
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:30.701]  Well, here's an example.
[02:31:30.761 --> 02:31:32.622]  Jess Adkins was an award-winning vet.
[02:31:32.642 --> 02:31:33.503]  I think he's still employed.
[02:31:33.563 --> 02:31:34.684]  I worked for him in high school.
[02:31:35.465 --> 02:31:41.168]  And he would like advise people, they'd say, oh, I'm here for my cat's yearly vaccine, especially cats, he said, but dogs.
[02:31:41.489 --> 02:31:43.370]  He only did small animals like one day a week.
[02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:44.710]  He'd have lines out of his clinic.
[02:31:44.931 --> 02:31:49.013]  He mainly did industrial, you know, big artificial insemination and all this stuff in cows and horses.
[02:31:49.893 --> 02:31:51.935]  And cloning was already starting to come along.
[02:31:51.995 --> 02:31:58.458]  And he did some cloning work, but that was separately at A&M that he would go like one day a month and work at A&M, like secret cloning stuff.
[02:31:58.498 --> 02:32:00.440]  But let's just say he didn't talk about it.
[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:02.161]  But he said, oh, man,
[02:32:03.121 --> 02:32:04.022]  I believe in vaccines.
[02:32:04.042 --> 02:32:06.243]  You can learn immunity from these because they're so tainted.
[02:32:06.263 --> 02:32:07.623]  They've got so many side effects.
[02:32:08.083 --> 02:32:12.686]  I've noticed people's cats and dogs die when they take vaccines every year and he would tell people just don't take them.
[02:32:12.946 --> 02:32:17.248]  So, I mean, he was just seeing the animals get sick and understanding it.
[02:32:18.737 --> 02:32:21.701]  Yeah, you know, there, yeah.
[02:32:21.801 --> 02:32:27.187]  Again, without getting into too much detail, I mean, there are certain vaccines that cause more of an immune response than others.
[02:32:27.407 --> 02:32:28.669]  Sure, but don't hang up, don't hang up.
[02:32:28.709 --> 02:32:35.958]  Do five more minutes and explain this cat thing, because I remember reading this, but I don't remember the details, and I want to look into it and do a whole show, because that's huge.
[02:32:35.998 --> 02:32:36.398]  That's what...
[02:32:37.199 --> 02:32:38.319]  I've read these medical reports.
[02:32:38.339 --> 02:32:41.480]  They're worried that it's going to create this protein in the cell.
[02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:43.561]  Then when the cell dies, it's going to release it.
[02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:44.701]  There's going to be an autoimmune response.
[02:32:44.741 --> 02:32:45.522]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:32:45.762 --> 02:32:46.402]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:46.442 --> 02:32:47.182]  Stay with us.
[02:32:47.222 --> 02:32:48.583]  Jess is the medical doctor calling in.
[02:32:50.843 --> 02:32:52.224]  All right, I'm going to finish up with this doctor.
[02:32:52.244 --> 02:32:55.045]  I'm going to get to every one of these great callers that is holding.
[02:32:55.065 --> 02:32:56.485]  But this is a very important call.
[02:32:57.325 --> 02:33:00.526]  And, you know, I just scratch around and try to read all the literature and figure out what's going on.
[02:33:00.566 --> 02:33:01.747]  I see a lot of top scientists.
[02:33:02.711 --> 02:33:08.495]  Very respected people, medical doctors, virologists, epidemiologists saying you might as well kill yourself if you take this.
[02:33:09.956 --> 02:33:11.537]  And I've talked to some of these guys off record.
[02:33:11.577 --> 02:33:13.678]  I've told this story.
[02:33:13.698 --> 02:33:15.139]  I wish I could get the guy on there.
[02:33:15.159 --> 02:33:15.640]  He won't do it.
[02:33:16.841 --> 02:33:27.363]  Um, but he started telling my lawyers about it, and they told me about it, and then we talked to him, and he's the head of a major biotech company, and he said months ago, this is deadly, it's not going to help you, it's crazy.
[02:33:27.843 --> 02:33:30.444]  And he can't figure out, he said Fauci and Gates are scammers.
[02:33:30.924 --> 02:33:35.425]  He doesn't know how they're going to get away with it when it all comes out that it's killing and hurting people and doesn't protect you.
[02:33:35.445 --> 02:33:38.045]  Because people are still getting the COVID after they've had the vaccine.
[02:33:38.985 --> 02:33:41.606]  And that's my question.
[02:33:43.371 --> 02:33:46.433]  But later we learned Hitler was attacking everybody.
[02:33:46.814 --> 02:33:48.035]  He even knew he was going to lose.
[02:33:48.075 --> 02:33:49.075]  He just wanted to kill people.
[02:33:49.976 --> 02:33:52.698]  And so we're not thinking like they're thinking.
[02:33:53.579 --> 02:33:55.200]  I mean, Bill Gates is a eugenicist.
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:56.481]  Bill Gates is a crazy person.
[02:33:57.884 --> 02:34:05.490]  And maybe he wants to discredit other regular gene therapy, because there's a bunch of real-life extension stuff coming out that actually has been tested and works that they won't approve.
[02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:07.311]  I mean, they've got antibody stuff.
[02:34:07.331 --> 02:34:10.694]  I was talking to top scientists that, like, knocks out colon cancer almost 100%.
[02:34:11.635 --> 02:34:12.175]  Won't approve it.
[02:34:12.515 --> 02:34:13.816]  That's what Trump wants to speed up.
[02:34:13.856 --> 02:34:14.757]  He believes in medicine.
[02:34:15.197 --> 02:34:20.561]  We can do amazing things, but it's like bad stuff we're getting that causes all these problems, doesn't protect you.
[02:34:20.662 --> 02:34:22.523]  What is Bill Gates thinking?
[02:34:23.043 --> 02:34:24.665]  Finishing up, Jess, with the cats.
[02:34:25.245 --> 02:34:27.735]  Getting the vaccine and then developing the virus and dying.
[02:34:28.016 --> 02:34:28.959]  People can look that up.
[02:34:29.622 --> 02:34:31.027]  Other key tidbits you'd like to add?
[02:34:32.648 --> 02:34:36.050]  Yeah, so basically, again, two big things here.
[02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:49.259]  I think the biggest thing that has been so frustrating to any of us who are not just in the medical community, but people who are health minded in general, is that throughout all of this, not once has anyone actually spoken about true health measures.
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.962]  It's been about hiding ourselves, putting this dirty dishrag on our mouth.
[02:34:54.022 --> 02:35:00.026]  I mean, my place of work, we're reusing masks for like a week at a time because we're told not to waste things.
[02:35:00.106 --> 02:35:02.568]  But we all know that that doesn't work the minute blood or
[02:35:02.608 --> 02:35:03.449]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:21.207 --> 02:35:21.608]  Thank you.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:42.001]  Yeah, and you know, it's more about that than what is the true health of the patient.
[02:35:42.461 --> 02:35:55.665]  And so, you know, we've seen a push over the last 10, 20 years in medical education of all different types about treating the whole person, you know, not just treating the signs that you're seeing, but the mental health, all of that.
[02:35:56.245 --> 02:36:03.167]  But the good news I hear is you're saying your parents are well-respected, good doctors, and you're saying they're awake.
[02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:05.229]  Yeah, they're awake.
[02:36:05.269 --> 02:36:08.131]  I mean, they're getting out though, but, you know, because they're at that age.
[02:36:08.211 --> 02:36:16.915]  But, you know, there are too many younger people who were told to do one thing, but then what is actually being practiced is a completely separate issue.
[02:36:17.135 --> 02:36:19.496]  And so that has been entirely frustrating.
[02:36:19.516 --> 02:36:20.776]  Let me ask you this.
[02:36:20.856 --> 02:36:22.277]  What do you make of Bill Gates?
[02:36:22.617 --> 02:36:23.498]  Who dropped out of college.
[02:36:52.517 --> 02:36:52.968]  We're good.
[02:36:54.316 --> 02:37:23.776]  Yeah, it's it's beyond frustrating and all it is is really money and a platform and I think that because of the way the doctors have been demonized over the years as you know people who are just especially surgeons just trying to get to their one o'clock tea time on the golf course having someone who's not exactly a medical professional coming in and trying to be this benevolent figure as being slightly separate from true medicine I think some people actually find that more appealing than a doctor getting up there because then they say oh well you're only doing it for for monetary effort you're not doing
[02:37:24.036 --> 02:37:27.937]  They don't get that Bill Gates literally admitted he makes 21 ratio off vaccine.
[02:37:28.938 --> 02:37:29.738]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:37:29.758 --> 02:37:36.640]  But I mean, these are the same people who also don't realize that as the recent reports have come out that he owns the majority of farmland now.
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:38.721]  He's the largest owner of farmland in the United States.
[02:37:39.121 --> 02:37:39.481]  Why?
[02:37:39.682 --> 02:37:40.242]  Why would he?
[02:37:40.562 --> 02:37:41.282]  Why would he need that?
[02:37:41.402 --> 02:37:43.003]  Again, he owns and directs.
[02:37:43.803 --> 02:37:47.484]  His hundreds of billions that are tax-exempt, and he gets all the benefits from it.
[02:37:47.504 --> 02:37:48.864]  It's just simply incredible.
[02:37:49.204 --> 02:37:50.765]  Hey, Jess, thank you so much.
[02:37:51.065 --> 02:37:55.866]  If you'd like to come on as a secret guest on some of the other shows, you can trust us.
[02:37:56.526 --> 02:38:00.688]  If you want to give us your number, we'd love to have you on as a guest on The War Room or on American Journal.
[02:38:00.708 --> 02:38:01.768]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[02:38:02.776 --> 02:38:04.017]  God bless you, thank you very much.
[02:38:04.438 --> 02:38:07.220]  I could talk to Jess for hours, because it's good to actually talk to someone that's informed.
[02:38:08.101 --> 02:38:11.744]  I just read the medical literature from Respected, and they're like, this is crazy.
[02:38:12.265 --> 02:38:14.067]  I mean, this is the top people.
[02:38:14.507 --> 02:38:27.840]  And that's the good thing, is all the, most of the top people are like, coming out and saying this is wrong, like the head of the Rockefeller Hospital, and the head of Mount Sinai, and the Cedar Sinai, and the head of this, the head of that, and then you just hear them shut down.
[02:38:28.749 --> 02:38:30.290]  Can you imagine being YouTube?
[02:38:30.310 --> 02:38:35.615]  Can you imagine being Facebook and Twitter and, like, the head of a hospital's warning people and you go, bloop!
[02:38:36.456 --> 02:38:39.479]  Or the head of a hospital's having a congressional hearing that you don't like and you go, bloop!
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:43.002]  I mean, there's some evil stuff there, boy!
[02:38:43.022 --> 02:38:45.164]  I mean, what is it?
[02:38:45.224 --> 02:38:48.827]  If it's so wonderful, your vaccine's so good, then why don't you let us all talk about it?
[02:38:50.134 --> 02:38:53.057]  Think about how far we've come because we're in the jaws of this thing.
[02:38:53.498 --> 02:38:55.900]  It's like a lion jumps on you and is dragging your way to eat you.
[02:38:56.201 --> 02:38:57.942]  I mean, you know, it's like, whoa, this is really intense.
[02:38:58.263 --> 02:38:59.544]  Yeah, they're attacking.
[02:39:01.727 --> 02:39:05.431]  And when Hitler attacked Russia and England and they rolled their sleeves up and fought back.
[02:39:06.452 --> 02:39:08.133]  I'm not saying go out and blow people's heads off.
[02:39:08.213 --> 02:39:08.794]  It's not like that.
[02:39:08.834 --> 02:39:12.038]  It's a corporate attack using disinfo by big banks.
[02:39:13.646 --> 02:39:14.887]  So we've got to become aware of that.
[02:39:14.947 --> 02:39:20.410]  I just want to tell you, whether you're a school teacher or a doctor or an FBI agent, this is all real, folks.
[02:39:21.671 --> 02:39:24.552]  This program is so big of eugenics.
[02:39:24.572 --> 02:39:28.535]  They tried to recruit my dad in high school because he was top of his class.
[02:39:30.456 --> 02:39:33.578]  And my dad didn't tell me about that till I was 30-something years old.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:37.120]  Think about that.
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:38.621]  It's so widespread.
[02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:40.442]  They tried to recruit my father into this.
[02:39:41.812 --> 02:39:43.093]  And he never even told me.
[02:39:43.374 --> 02:39:44.195]  He's like, no, you're right.
[02:39:44.215 --> 02:39:45.076]  They tried to recruit me to this.
[02:39:45.416 --> 02:39:46.938]  That's how big this is, folks.
[02:39:46.978 --> 02:39:49.440]  That's how huge this is, the whole enchilada.
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:50.021]  And guess what?
[02:39:50.301 --> 02:39:51.643]  Bill Gates did get recruited.
[02:39:52.984 --> 02:39:55.847]  And when you get recruited and play ball with them, you go right to the top.
[02:39:57.028 --> 02:39:58.410]  And what is the thing they're building?
[02:39:58.570 --> 02:39:59.131]  It's evil.
[02:40:01.741 --> 02:40:07.825]  And you know, instead of just poisoning everybody and giving them cancer, if there's too many people, which I don't agree with, neutron bomb us at least!
[02:40:07.865 --> 02:40:09.006]  Just kill us, my God!
[02:40:09.287 --> 02:40:09.867]  Torture us!
[02:40:09.887 --> 02:40:13.510]  But see, the globalists love all this, this taking their time with us, don't they?
[02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:16.212]  Alright, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:40:16.232 --> 02:40:17.653]  Is it Melissa?
[02:40:19.094 --> 02:40:19.734]  Is it Tom?
[02:40:19.814 --> 02:40:20.635]  Is it Andrew?
[02:40:20.655 --> 02:40:26.119]  Yeah, it's Tom and then... Tom, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:40:26.659 --> 02:40:28.540]  I don't think you minded though, that doctor was pretty strong.
[02:40:29.907 --> 02:40:31.510]  Alex, Idaho loves you, man.
[02:40:31.711 --> 02:40:32.733]  I'm from Boise, Idaho.
[02:40:32.853 --> 02:40:36.680]  I wanted to let you know we love you, and you got great callers, you got a great show.
[02:40:37.241 --> 02:40:42.331]  I also wanted to let people know that are moving here in droves that we are in serious trouble here in the state as well.
[02:40:43.018 --> 02:40:52.261]  But you know, you've continued to ask what to do and what to do, and I was very, very careful about wanting to be able to say this on air because I don't want to disrespect you, because that's not my intent.
[02:40:52.981 --> 02:41:00.223]  I happen to be the Idaho coordinator for the John Burr Society, and we've got an action, we've had a coordinated concerted action plan.
[02:41:00.888 --> 02:41:01.890]  For 62 years.
[02:41:02.671 --> 02:41:07.298]  Would it be appropriate to even let people know that there are things that we can do as a country?
[02:41:07.318 --> 02:41:07.979]  Oh, that's right.
[02:41:07.999 --> 02:41:14.288]  The John Birch Society has been the preeminent group of patriots that understood the whole thing and have been fighting it from the beginning.
[02:41:14.308 --> 02:41:15.090]  Yeah, tell folks about it.
[02:41:16.069 --> 02:41:16.469]  Well, good.
[02:41:16.489 --> 02:41:18.990]  So, I mean, we're a 62-year-old organization.
[02:41:19.010 --> 02:41:20.470]  We're an education and action group.
[02:41:20.490 --> 02:41:32.054]  We focus on several different areas, one being history, current events, constitution, and the element that I think only you and I, or you and our organization, cover, and that's the element of conspiracy that people need to know.
[02:41:32.074 --> 02:41:36.716]  Because if you don't know the enemy, and you don't know yourself, you're going to be imperiled in every battle.
[02:41:37.216 --> 02:41:39.176]  You know, we've got a huge over here.
[02:41:39.236 --> 02:41:41.477]  Our governors are on the friendlies for the CCP.
[02:41:42.137 --> 02:41:44.078]  They tried to implement foreign trade zones.
[02:41:44.458 --> 02:41:47.841]  You know, we've got a congressman now that's trying to breach four dams.
[02:41:47.961 --> 02:41:58.208]  I mean, I'm just letting people know, I know this is not about Idaho, but I want to let people know that, you know, I know Skousen says this is, you know, the number one place to be able to go and those kinds of things.
[02:41:58.609 --> 02:41:59.369]  Tom, don't hang up.
[02:41:59.389 --> 02:42:00.550]  We'll come back and finish up with you.
[02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:04.433]  And for those that don't know, they want to blow all the dams up and take the hydroelectric too.
[02:42:04.733 --> 02:42:06.875]  Hydroelectric's totally clean, no evil carbon.
[02:42:07.295 --> 02:42:07.936]  They want those blown.
[02:42:08.536 --> 02:42:09.757]  But China gets all the coal plants.
[02:42:09.797 --> 02:42:11.859]  We are under military attack.
[02:42:11.899 --> 02:42:19.867]  And General Ida Ray is on the news saying he is prepared to wage war against America to confiscate all guns and kill American citizens en masse.
[02:42:20.567 --> 02:42:21.709]  Even Tucker Carlson's covering it.
[02:42:21.729 --> 02:42:23.370]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:42:24.091 --> 02:42:26.133]  And if we let him normalize it, Katie, bar the door.
[02:42:27.454 --> 02:42:28.035]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:28.075 --> 02:42:30.277]  We'll finish up with Tom and get others on the other side.
[02:42:32.483 --> 02:42:40.606]  All right, we got loaded phone lines with Andrew and Colin and Steve and Jefferson and Sarah and Michael and David in Hawaii and Carlos and Melissa.
[02:42:40.626 --> 02:42:42.307]  So I'm just going to the next hour with Owen Schreuer.
[02:42:42.347 --> 02:42:43.307]  He's happy to have me with him.
[02:42:43.928 --> 02:42:45.988]  So until we get all your calls done, I will be here.
[02:42:46.489 --> 02:42:56.633]  And I'm in Owen's studio, because the other big studio is getting hooked back up after power outages and fuses blowing and generators hooked up and all sorts of fun things trying to burn down the building here.
[02:42:56.673 --> 02:42:58.834]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:59.234 --> 02:43:00.114]  Tom in Idaho.
[02:43:00.134 --> 02:43:00.774]  You're absolutely right.
[02:43:00.794 --> 02:43:01.495]  For those that don't know,
[02:43:02.395 --> 02:43:03.075]  The U.N.
[02:43:03.475 --> 02:43:04.795]  wants to get rid of all the dams.
[02:43:04.935 --> 02:43:05.936]  It's not about the fishies.
[02:43:05.976 --> 02:43:07.196]  They don't want us to have power again.
[02:43:07.476 --> 02:43:09.576]  But it's only the West that can't have power.
[02:43:09.956 --> 02:43:11.977]  China and everybody else, they can, can't they?
[02:43:13.057 --> 02:43:14.097]  Yep, they sure can.
[02:43:14.797 --> 02:43:26.819]  And this guy, I mean, this guy claims he's a Republican, and this is part of the problem we have in Idaho with these Republican neocons, is that the average person here in Idaho, if they've got a cowboy hat, you know, they feel like they can vote with an R behind their name.
[02:43:26.879 --> 02:43:29.820]  This guy absolutely comes out, aligns with the hard left,
[02:43:30.339 --> 02:43:32.601]  You know, I travel the states, so I know a lot of people.
[02:43:32.641 --> 02:43:40.466]  I mean, millions of dollars were used on canal projects and all kinds of things.
[02:43:40.506 --> 02:43:41.367]  They were all led on.
[02:43:41.787 --> 02:43:48.452]  And I think what they did was they led them on long enough to be able to destroy the amount of investment and then close the project.
[02:43:48.979 --> 02:43:55.924]  So he's basically talking about this whole thing I heard on the radio here locally about a new... What you said is so smart, just like Keystone.
[02:43:56.264 --> 02:43:59.866]  They let them spend the twenty-something billion on it, and then they kill the project at the end of it.
[02:43:59.926 --> 02:44:11.214]  I mean, they let you lobby to have your project, and they make you pay for the project, and you gotta pay them a cut of the project, and then they pull it out from under you, because they don't want business in America.
[02:44:11.294 --> 02:44:12.555]  It's so sick.
[02:44:13.453 --> 02:44:15.655]  Hey Alex, I just want to tell you, I love your products too.
[02:44:15.675 --> 02:44:21.499]  I had to plug, I was doing, I tried your Turbo Force, that stuff, and the Alpha Power and the Super Male.
[02:44:21.539 --> 02:44:23.980]  I've been a big fan of your Dad's Toothpaste.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:25.321]  I mean, you guys rock, man.
[02:44:25.341 --> 02:44:26.062]  Your news is good.
[02:44:26.102 --> 02:44:26.962]  You're rocking, brother.
[02:44:26.982 --> 02:44:27.743]  We love you, Tom.
[02:44:27.763 --> 02:44:28.143]  Thank you.
[02:44:28.163 --> 02:44:30.085]  Like I said, I'm hosting the next hour.
[02:44:30.145 --> 02:44:31.686]  I'm going to every one of these wonderful callers.
[02:44:32.106 --> 02:44:33.327]  Alright, who's been home the next longest?
[02:44:33.347 --> 02:44:34.408]  That'll be Andrew in Texas.
[02:44:34.428 --> 02:44:34.928]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[02:44:38.803 --> 02:44:39.504]  We're good to go.
[02:44:56.059 --> 02:45:01.263]  Suspicious about buying any of the products, start out with the iodine, see what that does for you.
[02:45:01.964 --> 02:45:05.186]  But yeah, most people are deficient in iodine.
[02:45:05.846 --> 02:45:09.289]  And so if you don't have it, then you just start breaking down every level.
[02:45:09.309 --> 02:45:10.410]  And look, I look like hell.
[02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:12.491]  I gained 30-something pounds during the election.
[02:45:12.511 --> 02:45:14.013]  I got super upset.
[02:45:14.373 --> 02:45:15.474]  Cortisol has been released.
[02:45:16.254 --> 02:45:17.775]  I've just been really worried about the election.
[02:45:17.835 --> 02:45:19.497]  I knew Trump was surrounded, people wouldn't listen to me.
[02:45:20.257 --> 02:45:37.882]  I try I mean I don't feel sorry for myself but I mean I really know what's going on I'm like begging people no it's an emergency they're gonna steal it and and I I I've even been eating less food and I just got fat and unhealthy and I even stopped stop taking some of the supplements but as soon as I go back on them I just I just feel so good
[02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:46.492]  NX2 is just a deep earth crystal, super high quality iodine, and we're really, really proud of it.
[02:45:46.512 --> 02:45:54.796]  So I apologize to the caller, but as soon as I get another headset, I'll just take a regular wire if you guys got one, we will do that.
[02:45:55.136 --> 02:46:01.319]  Let me go ahead and just play this report for you, then we'll come back with your calls, and I'll be hosting part of the fourth hour with you.
[02:46:02.139 --> 02:46:03.319]  Let's just play.
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:05.921]  Some of this report here.
[02:46:06.382 --> 02:46:17.351]  Let's play the climate czar says the quiet part aloud from Massachusetts about turning the power off on retirees and breaking their will.
[02:46:17.491 --> 02:46:18.612]  Then we'll go right back to your calls.
[02:46:18.652 --> 02:46:20.713]  Here it is.
[02:46:20.733 --> 02:46:30.502]  You know, one thing that we found through our analysis is that 60% of our emissions come from, as I have been starting to say, you and me, except you guys are in Vermont.
[02:46:30.522 --> 02:46:33.364]  60% of our emissions come from residential heating.
[02:46:35.071 --> 02:46:36.472]  And passenger vehicles.
[02:46:36.672 --> 02:46:37.393]  So let me say that again.
[02:46:37.413 --> 02:46:47.062]  60% of our emissions that need to be reduced come from you, the person of the street, the senior on fixed income, right?
[02:46:47.542 --> 02:46:56.630]  There is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts, to point the finger at, turn the screws on, and break their will so they stop emitting.
[02:46:56.850 --> 02:46:57.331]  That's you.
[02:46:57.351 --> 02:46:58.492]  We have to break your will.
[02:47:00.053 --> 02:47:01.274]  I can't even say that publicly.
[02:47:01.334 --> 02:47:01.995]  What I'm trying to say is,
[02:47:03.939 --> 02:47:07.262]  Doesn't everybody get the sick joke?
[02:47:07.382 --> 02:47:09.505]  We need to break their will so they stop emitting.
[02:47:09.665 --> 02:47:11.446]  You emit carbon dioxide.
[02:47:13.669 --> 02:47:17.753]  That's why when Bill Gates goes, oh, this is going to take a long time to beat the virus, you're the virus.
[02:47:18.714 --> 02:47:20.015]  And I'm not just saying that as a metaphor.
[02:47:20.155 --> 02:47:20.716]  You understand.
[02:47:21.336 --> 02:47:22.437]  You are the virus.
[02:47:23.879 --> 02:47:26.902]  It was so chilling to watch that evil Saki, the press secretary up there.
[02:47:27.915 --> 02:47:29.216]  And they're like, will it ever end?
[02:47:29.316 --> 02:47:31.117]  And they go, you can only hope.
[02:47:31.878 --> 02:47:33.319]  And she's talking about killing everybody in the room.
[02:47:33.359 --> 02:47:34.580]  I mean, she's in on the sick joke.
[02:47:35.561 --> 02:47:38.623]  And that wench thinks that her and her kids will be safe pulling this off.
[02:47:40.044 --> 02:47:42.566]  She don't know much about reap what you sow.
[02:47:42.586 --> 02:47:45.508]  I mean, call it what you want.
[02:47:45.548 --> 02:47:47.169]  What comes around goes around, sweetheart.
[02:47:47.189 --> 02:47:49.911]  That's why I'm God fearing.
[02:47:50.091 --> 02:47:52.033]  Fearing God pulls out on me.
[02:47:52.053 --> 02:47:54.114]  I'll explain that again.
[02:47:54.134 --> 02:47:55.075]  I don't fear God.
[02:47:55.135 --> 02:47:56.056]  I'm not scared of God.
[02:47:56.076 --> 02:47:57.257]  I'm scared of God leaving me.
[02:47:59.241 --> 02:48:00.301]  That's why I walk the line.
[02:48:01.262 --> 02:48:02.362]  I don't screw anybody over.
[02:48:04.263 --> 02:48:07.464]  I'm like Mr. Magoo, because the big guy's watching.
[02:48:10.705 --> 02:48:14.187]  And you people that have given up on God, I feel sorry for you, actually.
[02:48:14.587 --> 02:48:16.228]  All right, Andrew, sorry my headset went out.
[02:48:16.668 --> 02:48:17.888]  It does it about every four hours.
[02:48:17.948 --> 02:48:20.789]  I guess I just did four hours, so it went out.
[02:48:20.849 --> 02:48:22.470]  But we're going to host in the next hour.
[02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:24.371]  For all the callers, we really appreciate you staying with us.
[02:48:24.891 --> 02:48:26.011]  Andrew, go ahead and make your point again.
[02:48:26.031 --> 02:48:27.132]  Sorry, it cut out.
[02:48:28.067 --> 02:48:28.947]  Oh, you're fine Alex.
[02:48:29.047 --> 02:48:29.948]  Amen.
[02:48:30.028 --> 02:48:32.428]  You're in the arena as the stuff happens.
[02:48:33.569 --> 02:48:48.253]  I was just, after I went over the stuff with the InfoWars products, also wanted to say I've got a pretty sweet US Baseball shirt and the Trader Joe's shirt, essential oils, all sorts of stuff from InfoWars.
[02:48:49.628 --> 02:48:55.950]  Really, just as a Texan, pretty PO'd about all of the stuff that's going on with ERCOT right now.
[02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:58.591]  I really appreciate you going through all that.
[02:48:59.131 --> 02:49:18.157]  What I wanted to suggest to any other Texans who are or are not affected by this whole situation, this morning I wrote to my state rep and then decided, hey, I'm going to go ahead and send that to Senator Cruz, send it to Governor Abbott, and then I also sent it to
[02:49:19.275 --> 02:49:41.020]  Attorney General Ken Paxton, and I know that guy's a patriot because I'm not going to say I was there, wink, wink, but I know that he spoke at the Capitol, well, prior to the Capitol on January the 6th, and I just feel like if we can, in numbers, get out there and kind of point this out to our representatives and our
[02:49:44.591 --> 02:49:45.832]  I totally agree with you, brother.
[02:49:45.932 --> 02:49:51.694]  And the way they're trying to destroy Trump is to scare anybody off from supporting any other patriot in the future.
[02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:53.935]  That's why we've got to be strong and take our licks.
[02:49:54.275 --> 02:49:54.915]  Thank you, Andrew.
[02:49:55.315 --> 02:49:58.436]  All right, Colin in North Dakota.
[02:49:59.077 --> 02:50:02.298]  Last caller for this hour, but I'm going to come back in the war room in mere minutes.
[02:50:02.318 --> 02:50:07.000]  We're going right to your calls immediately with Owen Schroyer when we start the next hour.
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:07.860]  Colin, go ahead.
[02:50:09.275 --> 02:50:10.816]  Well, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:50:11.236 --> 02:50:12.776]  First time caller since 1998.
[02:50:13.517 --> 02:50:20.079]  And I want to thank you and everybody you used to create Knockout and your dad's rocket rest.
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:26.121]  I couldn't carry the information that many of us carry and get a good night's sleep without it.
[02:50:26.201 --> 02:50:27.362]  So thank you for that as well.
[02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:39.174]  The genesis for my call kind of goes back to what JFK said about how those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[02:50:39.454 --> 02:50:49.438]  And I see that coming into view because many of the mechanisms, if not all of the mechanisms, for redress of grievance have been essentially been removed.
[02:50:50.619 --> 02:50:55.541]  And it makes me think about John Ross's book, Unintended Consequences.
[02:50:55.621 --> 02:50:56.541]  I don't know if you ever read it.
[02:50:57.173 --> 02:50:57.554]  Yes sir.
[02:50:57.574 --> 02:51:00.076]  Anyway, I just feel like we're like a slow-moving train wreck.
[02:51:16.488 --> 02:51:18.750]  And my mind just tells me we're out of time.
[02:51:19.170 --> 02:51:20.611]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:51:20.651 --> 02:51:21.612]  I'm physically ill.
[02:51:21.632 --> 02:51:22.193]  Because here's the deal.
[02:51:22.213 --> 02:51:24.575]  I don't have any desire to kill globalists.
[02:51:24.595 --> 02:51:25.856]  They're such sacks of garbage.
[02:51:26.216 --> 02:51:28.438]  But I mean, the thing is, they're not going to stop.
[02:51:28.618 --> 02:51:29.719]  They just have a desire.
[02:51:29.779 --> 02:51:30.520]  They're mentally ill.
[02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:36.304]  And all these idiot lawyers that let them go, and the FBI that let them do this, like the FBI is worried about patriots?
[02:51:36.344 --> 02:51:38.586]  You ought to be worried about the globalists starting a damn war!
[02:51:38.606 --> 02:51:40.108]  I mean, you people are nuts!
[02:51:40.748 --> 02:51:41.669]  You're out of your minds.
[02:51:41.709 --> 02:51:43.791]  You're destroying the country for the CHICOMS.
[02:51:43.811 --> 02:51:44.471]  You're a joke.
[02:51:44.892 --> 02:51:48.395]  And they've put a skeleton minion zombie in as the president.
[02:51:50.299 --> 02:51:56.721]  And, uh, I wanted to ask you about, uh, Foster versus Love, 1997 Supreme Court ruling.
[02:51:56.741 --> 02:51:58.281]  Hold on, Colin, don't hang up.
[02:51:58.762 --> 02:52:01.722]  You're going to be with me on The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:52:02.203 --> 02:52:07.644]  And if the station doesn't carry it, InfoWars.com forward slash show, band dot video, the Owen Schroyer area.
[02:52:07.964 --> 02:52:09.345]  The War Room is coming up.
[02:52:09.405 --> 02:52:13.746]  Colin, Steve, Jefferson, Sarah, Michael, Dave, Carlos, Melissa, taking your own.
[02:52:18.668 --> 02:52:19.848]  It's a little apocalyptic.
[02:52:21.195 --> 02:52:25.078]  I'm telling you this, my Patriot supply for PrepareWithAlex.com is so good I'm in here trying to get some more.
[02:52:25.498 --> 02:52:26.899]  Zeroman's been working 20 hours a day.
[02:52:27.719 --> 02:52:29.160]  One of the most avid players here.
[02:52:30.221 --> 02:52:31.062]  Trying to feed people.
[02:52:31.082 --> 02:52:33.343]  Because the power's off for most of our crew members.
[02:52:34.624 --> 02:52:35.725]  And because we're not essential.
[02:52:36.666 --> 02:52:40.588]  And the grocery stores are all basically closed except a few essential ones.
[02:52:40.608 --> 02:52:43.930]  Because they just decide whose grocery store can be essential, who isn't.
[02:52:44.551 --> 02:52:45.612]  This is the new planned economy.
[02:52:46.152 --> 02:52:50.195]  So now it's not just the big banks that get in on it and big tech that doubles all its profits under the lockdown.
[02:52:51.345 --> 02:52:55.307]  Now all the local groups that are essential get to get in on the fun as well.
[02:52:55.747 --> 02:52:58.389]  And then they decide, your restaurant's closed, yours is open.
[02:52:59.149 --> 02:53:00.890]  Your hospital's closed, yours is open.
[02:53:01.170 --> 02:53:02.451]  It's all very technocratic.
[02:53:02.491 --> 02:53:03.471]  It's all done by computer.
[02:53:03.712 --> 02:53:04.952]  It's all liberal.
[02:53:05.352 --> 02:53:06.833]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:53:08.494 --> 02:53:09.355]  I call this normal food.
[02:53:09.375 --> 02:53:10.215]  Well, you still can.
[02:53:10.655 --> 02:53:12.456]  And it's ready to ship out from the warehouse in Utah.
[02:53:12.476 --> 02:53:13.157]  Preparewithalex.com.
[02:53:13.177 --> 02:53:13.777]  Ask for it.
[02:53:13.877 --> 02:53:14.457]  It's a broadcast.
[02:53:14.497 --> 02:53:15.618]  Without you, I wouldn't be on air.
[02:53:18.109 --> 02:53:22.190]  The need for storable foods are increasingly apparent.
[02:53:23.211 --> 02:53:32.094]  With millions left without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[02:53:33.519 --> 02:53:40.644]  The lines at the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are left bare.
[02:53:41.784 --> 02:53:54.913]  Now we know that in the most historic record freezing temperatures in over a century, your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[02:53:56.638 --> 02:54:01.299]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:12.023]  Go to infowarrestore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure you and your family are prepared for the unimaginable.
[02:54:13.063 --> 02:54:15.504]  Get your storable foods at infowarrestore.com.
[02:54:21.874 --> 02:54:24.135]  We're not gonna be on the air unless we have your support.
[02:54:24.195 --> 02:54:27.497]  Plus, we've got great products that everybody already needs.
[02:54:27.738 --> 02:54:29.078]  It's been sold out for a while.
[02:54:29.619 --> 02:54:34.242]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immunity and for your body's defenses.
[02:54:35.342 --> 02:54:38.524]  It's something that's essential that everyone needs regardless.
[02:54:38.704 --> 02:54:41.066]  The globalists don't want you knowing how to protect yourself.
[02:54:41.146 --> 02:54:42.307]  A limited supply.
[02:54:42.427 --> 02:54:43.567]  A limited supply.
[02:54:43.647 --> 02:54:45.389]  Because they can't get the bottles or the caps.
[02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:46.949]  They may have to change the packaging.
[02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.710]  Has come in.
[02:54:47.730 --> 02:54:50.191]  It'll probably be sold out in a week at the amount we have.
[02:54:50.272 --> 02:54:50.932]  Despite that, it's
[02:54:51.032 --> 02:54:52.353]  Twenty-five percent off.
[02:54:52.373 --> 02:54:53.914]  You take it sublingually under the tongue.
[02:54:53.994 --> 02:54:57.056]  A lot of people, especially older folks, cannot absorb B3 in the gut.
[02:54:57.076 --> 02:55:01.659]  But under the tongue, if you hold it for about a minute, you get most of it, along with the vitamin K that helps with the delivery.
[02:55:01.779 --> 02:55:03.480]  Ultra high-quality packaged stock.
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:11.926]  You can get it for 40% off when you get it with Ultra 12 super high-end vitamin B12 under the tongue for maximum absorption as well.
[02:55:12.526 --> 02:55:13.667]  Made by the same great lab.
[02:55:13.687 --> 02:55:15.088]  The highest in we can get.
[02:55:15.188 --> 02:55:15.928]  I'm so proud of it.
[02:55:16.068 --> 02:55:20.231]  Ultra 12 with it is 40% off in the combo pack.
[02:55:20.351 --> 02:55:24.734]  Get Ultra 12 by itself, because there's no shortage of that yet, for 50% off.
[02:55:24.754 --> 02:55:26.055]  Ultra 12, 50% off by itself.
[02:55:26.075 --> 02:55:27.376]  Winter Sun, 25% by itself.
[02:55:27.456 --> 02:55:28.016]  The two in a combo, 40%.
[02:55:30.878 --> 02:55:31.178]  98% off.
[02:55:31.279 --> 02:55:35.981]  No reviews on that, because it's a brand new combo, but look at the reviews of Ultra 12 and Winter Sun by itself.
[02:55:37.082 --> 02:55:35.981]  98, 99%.
[02:55:37.903 --> 02:55:39.624]  Thousands upon thousands of reviews.
[02:55:39.764 --> 02:55:43.586]  I can tell you this is made by the top lab in the country.
[02:55:43.606 --> 02:55:44.166]  4.9 stars.
[02:55:44.367 --> 02:55:45.227]  Limited supply.
[02:55:45.347 --> 02:55:55.173]  Separately, my dad, working with a major manufacturer, major developer, and a chemist, has launched his own line that we carry at mfoilworkstore.com, and these are all different formulas.
[02:55:55.193 --> 02:55:57.555]  It doesn't compete with Supermell Vitality or Alpha Power.
[02:55:57.575 --> 02:55:59.036]  It's just different, and it's really strong.
[02:55:59.716 --> 02:56:02.739]  Total Male Invigoration Primal Youth.
[02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:10.728]  Available Primal Youth along with the Extra Strength Kava Gel from Dr. Jones Naturals at MFullWorthStore.com.
[02:56:10.768 --> 02:56:16.554]  That's MFullWorthStore.com or find that and other products at Dr. Jones Naturals, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:56:27.984 --> 02:56:29.205]  This is the American Dream.
[02:56:29.645 --> 02:56:32.327]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[02:56:32.367 --> 02:56:38.071]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[02:56:38.551 --> 02:56:40.452]  They have so many Americans working for them.
[02:56:40.753 --> 02:56:44.675]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[02:56:45.035 --> 02:56:48.137]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[02:56:48.157 --> 02:56:54.322]  We are funded by you supporting us at InfoWareStore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[02:56:54.662 --> 02:56:57.324]  Now again, most companies buy in bulk.
[02:56:58.184 --> 02:57:02.607]  And then they advertise and have a really high price, so they make a profit off that food.
[02:57:02.627 --> 02:57:04.289]  But they don't produce it themselves.
[02:57:04.789 --> 02:57:06.690]  They don't stockpile it fresh.
[02:57:07.291 --> 02:57:11.193]  Almost all of this is coming off the assembly line and what they ship out in a day or two.
[02:57:11.274 --> 02:57:11.854]  Absolutely.
[02:57:11.894 --> 02:57:14.716]  So this Gaylord right here is going to go back to our kidding team.
[02:57:15.236 --> 02:57:17.438]  By tomorrow, these pouches are going to be inside of buckets.
[02:57:17.638 --> 02:57:19.499]  And the next day, those buckets are going to be out the door.
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:21.641]  So Joe, tell us what we're doing right here in the factory.
[02:57:21.741 --> 02:57:23.603]  So this is our shipping station right here, Alex.
[02:57:23.643 --> 02:57:27.025]  And this is actually InfoWars orders that are going out at this very moment.
[02:57:27.045 --> 02:57:29.167]  Like this order right here for Steven.
[02:57:29.187 --> 02:57:34.351]  Steven lives in California and he's going to get a special autographed pick ticket from Alex Jones.
[02:57:34.471 --> 02:57:37.274]  So I want to thank you for your support, plus you're getting some great storable food.
[02:57:37.334 --> 02:57:38.395]  So I'm your Christmas elf.
[02:57:38.775 --> 02:57:40.897]  A little bit late in the year, but thank you so much for your support, brother.
[02:57:41.457 --> 02:57:45.520]  Yeah, we're shipping products, you know, hundreds of packages per day through our state-of-the-art conveyor system.
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:47.542]  This is really the state-of-the-art thing.
[02:57:47.562 --> 02:57:51.284]  I think Amazon is what's comparable to what we do here at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:57:51.665 --> 02:57:53.046]  This is Lynn from Alabama.
[02:57:53.066 --> 02:57:54.587]  Lynn ordered for Infowars.com.
[02:57:54.647 --> 02:57:55.908]  Her order is going out this afternoon.
[02:57:55.948 --> 02:57:58.089]  It's going to be on her truck here in the next couple of minutes.
[02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:59.390]  It's going to be on her way to land.
[02:57:59.991 --> 02:58:02.092]  Lynn from Alabama, we love you and we appreciate you.
[02:58:02.112 --> 02:58:03.714]  You made the right choice with this affordable food.
[02:58:03.734 --> 02:58:05.115]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:58:05.475 --> 02:58:07.036]  And when did they put this order in?
[02:58:07.056 --> 02:58:07.957]  I want to see how fast it's going out.
[02:58:08.297 --> 02:58:12.260]  You know, this order was actually put in, I think, two days ago, and it's already going out the door.
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:16.623]  So, two days ago, fresh food produced, packaged right here in America.
[02:58:16.984 --> 02:58:17.744]  The whole nine yards.
[02:58:17.804 --> 02:58:18.985]  This is the American dream.
[02:58:19.005 --> 02:58:25.450]  This is American capitalism bringing us exceptionalism, bringing us more choices, and we thank you for keeping us on the air.
[02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:26.310]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:27.271 --> 02:58:32.775]  I've ordered a lot of high-quality food from you guys over the years, but it just gets better and better tasting, and the selection is so huge.
[02:58:33.216 --> 02:58:34.376]  And I was just walking around here.
[02:58:34.437 --> 02:58:37.459]  How many different variants and products do you have?
[02:58:38.663 --> 02:58:39.984]  We have hundreds of different products.
[02:58:40.064 --> 02:58:51.408]  And you know, when you're talking about food, I mean freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, freeze-dried meats, ready-made meals, just the ready-made meals that we have, the ones that come inside of the four-week kit, there's going to be at least 18 different varieties that we offer.
[02:58:51.508 --> 02:58:55.690]  And we keep expanding that as we do more research, as we do more configurations.
[02:58:55.730 --> 02:58:57.171]  We're going to be adding different meals.
[02:58:57.191 --> 02:58:59.412]  Your food was great 12 years ago, but now it's amazing.
[02:58:59.472 --> 02:59:02.733]  Chicken noodle, vegetarian taco, potato, cheese.
[02:59:03.113 --> 02:59:10.540]  TZ Broccoli Rice, Brown Sugar Oatmeal, Potato Cheddar, Peanut Butter, Corn Chowder, White Rice, Sugar.
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:15.985]  You got Wheat Honey Bread, Whey Milk, you'll have Traveler Stew, Chicken Noodle.
[02:59:16.025 --> 02:59:16.946]  Oh, I like Traveler Stew.
[02:59:17.146 --> 02:59:18.928]  Traveler Stew is one of our more popular ones.
[02:59:18.948 --> 02:59:20.149]  Chicken Noodle, it's excellent.
[02:59:20.429 --> 02:59:20.609]  Yep.
[02:59:20.749 --> 02:59:25.313]  I mean, we have almost anything that you would eat on a regular basis packaged in the long-term food storage.
[02:59:25.353 --> 02:59:26.174]  They've got everything, folks.
[02:59:26.194 --> 02:59:27.916]  You've got to check it out at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:28.156 --> 02:59:29.177]  The entire selection there.
[02:59:29.477 --> 02:59:33.320]  Literally, within a day or two of your order coming in, it's being shipped out to you.
[02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:36.502]  If it's local, in Utah, it's on those small trucks.
[02:59:36.902 --> 02:59:38.904]  If it's outside Utah, it's on big 18 wheelers.
[02:59:38.944 --> 02:59:48.911]  Again, that's why MyPatriot with Ready Hour has become the number one circle food company in the world because of quality, because of service, because of reliability, and because of good word of mouth.
[02:59:48.931 --> 02:59:52.854]  So I want to thank you all for supporting us and supporting our great supplier, MyPatriot.
[03:00:04.224 --> 03:00:08.456]  New Year's food, ladies and gentlemen, right here in America, and it funds the InfoWars.
[03:00:08.496 --> 03:00:10.722]  Go to infowarsstore.com today and get prepared.
