[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:04.430]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.610]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.331]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:14.752]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:27.194]  That's right, sitting in for Alex today and I want to tell you there really is so much news to cover.
[00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:42.116]  But I'm going to have to put that on hold for tomorrow, where I'll be doing double duty with Alex on the road, and I'm hoping that Alex will actually take this vacation and stay away.
[00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:42.997]  We haven't heard from him yet.
[00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:44.077]  That's a good sign.
[00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:47.219]  Alex, if you're listening, please just enjoy your vacation.
[00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.420]  Don't think about the New World Order.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.981]  Think about a nice juicy steak.
[00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.443]  Think about the time with your family, and we'll take care of things here in studio.
[00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.612]  I've got a lot on my mind, I've got a lot of news, but here's the thing.
[00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:14.675]  I'm going to put that on hold for tomorrow, until tomorrow, because we have to get ahead of this next big narrative that the mainstream media is about to push and that we're starting to see already.
[00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:18.096]  In fact, guys, do you have the tweets for me?
[00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:24.097]  I need that Mayor Adler tweet, because according to Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin, Texas,
[00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:31.634]  The entire city of Austin is going to be in the ICU by the end of the month.
[00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:33.335]  Yeah.
[00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:35.638]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.120]  I've got Mayor Adler's tweet right here.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.824]  And he shares the graph.
[00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:47.869]  And I covered it last week, but now I'm seeing the push.
[00:01:49.113 --> 00:02:02.561]  In the mainstream media, which means this is going to be their next big narrative, this is going to be their next big push for masks and vaccines and fear-mongering and everything, is that the hospitals are overwhelmed.
[00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.042]  And it's your fault!
[00:02:04.963 --> 00:02:06.944]  Because you didn't want to take a vaccine.
[00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:13.748]  Even though most of the people that are being admitted to the hospital for COVID have been vaccinated, they lie about that too.
[00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.991]  So again, here was the tweet put out by Mayor Adler last week,
[00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:24.292]  We can't be finished with a virus that's not finished with us.
[00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:30.894]  The green line is where we're headed if we don't all comply with my tyranny.
[00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:36.636]  And it shows hospitalizations, ICU, not just hospitalizations, the ICU.
[00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.177]  Look at that green line.
[00:02:38.337 --> 00:02:47.640]  That's what Mayor Adler says will happen if we don't all immediately wear masks 24-7, in the shower, in the bedroom, in the pool, anywhere, everywhere.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.185]  And all get vaccinated, because the masks don't work and the vaccines don't work, so you just gotta double down, wear 10 masks, take 10 vaccines.
[00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:56.946]  Hell, just kill yourself, really.
[00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:03.651]  And I guess that's the ultimate irony is, I can't catch a COVID virus if I'm dead.
[00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.575]  But so, again, this is the graph shared by Mayor Adler.
[00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:15.920]  He says everybody in the city of Austin is gonna be in the ICU by the end of the month, if we don't all wear masks and take vaccines.
[00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:37.769]  And I started to see a little bit in the media pushing this, but that just means, I think next week or the week after, they'll probably plan it out maybe with two weeks or a month before they think they're gonna have FDA authorization, if they have confidence in that happening, of the vaccine, so that they can mandate it, because that's their ultimate plan.
[00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.211]  So, the current game plan for this tyranny is,
[00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.473]  Bring back the fear-mongering, bring back the lockdowns, bring back the masks.
[00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:52.016]  Tell everybody they're gonna die if they don't take a vaccine or wear a mask.
[00:03:54.718 --> 00:03:58.701]  And then once they get the FDA approval for the vaccine, that's when they're gonna mandate it.
[00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:02.864]  And this is all gonna happen most likely within the next two months.
[00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:04.646]  Maybe even one month.
[00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:13.228]  But here's what I want to do today, and I'm going to come back in the next segment and give out the phone number, because I'm going to put all the news aside today.
[00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.572]  Not easy for me to do, because it's a lot of important developments, but we're going to cover it all tomorrow and the rest of the week.
[00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:22.554]  I'm going to open up the phone lines today exclusively to healthcare workers.
[00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:24.976]  Are your hospitals filled?
[00:04:26.152 --> 00:04:39.382]  Because I saw multiple news stories throughout the week, and doctors on Twitter, verified doctors you've never heard of, saying, the hospital's overwhelmed, people are waiting 48 hours to get in, we don't have medicine anymore, the outbreak is out of control!
[00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:45.626]  Remember just like they did last year, and then we did the same thing for days, and everybody said no, the hospitals are empty?
[00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:48.689]  So let's get out ahead of that false narrative tonight.
[00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.173]  How could you conquer the world without firing a single shot?
[00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.112]  Without dropping a single bomb?
[00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:18.230]  Well, you would manufacture a virus in a lab, have it get out of that lab, and then have the mainstream media run fear-mongering campaigns for months or years, however long it takes, over that virus until everyone was capitulated.
[00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:28.777]  You could bring in a one world government through it, medical tyranny through it, and then once you have the mandated vaccines, you have conquered the planet.
[00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:38.944]  That is the current globalist plan that we are under right now.
[00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:49.131]  Total capitulation of every human being on earth because of a COVID virus, manufactured in a Chinese military lab,
[00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.218]  With the aid of Anthony Fauci, with the aid of Barack Obama, with the aid of Bill Gates, and they all know it.
[00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.200]  They've all been caught.
[00:05:59.782 --> 00:06:03.708]  And I guess they're just hoping that the whole planet will capitulate soon enough that
[00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:15.848]  They'll have their world regime with medical tyranny in place before we could ever get justice against Anthony Fauci and everybody else involved in that Wuhan lab.
[00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.308]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:21.909]  We are live in the InfoWars World Headquarters on this Sunday, July 25th.
[00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:23.069]  Alex is on vacation.
[00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.490]  I'm hoping that he can actually take a vacation this time.
[00:06:30.464 --> 00:06:50.694]  I'm gonna be putting off all of the news today for tomorrow and the rest of this week, because specifically today, we have to get out ahead of the next big narrative, which is that the hospitals are overwhelmed, there's no hospital beds left, there's no medicine left, it's basically total dire straits at every hospital in America.
[00:06:50.774 --> 00:06:53.135]  COVID's back, Delta's back, everybody's dying.
[00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:55.977]  And, again,
[00:06:57.878 --> 00:07:09.102]  They haven't launched the full push yet, but there's been some preliminary pushes, for example, from our piece of absolute garbage.
[00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:12.723]  In fact, garbage has more use than our mayor, Steve Adler.
[00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:15.404]  At least you can incinerate garbage and, you know,
[00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.115]  Maybe there's something you can do with it.
[00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:19.636]  Adler has no use.
[00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:21.977]  This guy sucks.
[00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:26.401]  And the funny thing is, you go to every single one of his tweets, it's nothing but negative reviews.
[00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:30.343]  I don't know how this guy continues to get in office, except all of our elections are rigged.
[00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:35.567]  But so, I saw some, I saw a couple news reports from over the weekend.
[00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:41.631]  I saw a couple verified doctors on Twitter saying that there isn't an empty hospital bed in America right now.
[00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.712]  Delta's killing us all.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.081]  Which to me just means this is going to be their next big narrative.
[00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:49.521]  This is going to be their next big push.
[00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:50.241]  It's coming in a week.
[00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:51.181]  It's coming in two weeks.
[00:07:52.702 --> 00:08:01.004]  Just like they did, I guess it was really over a year ago, but they kind of did it all of the summer of 2020 saying hospitals are overwhelmed.
[00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:02.144]  ICU's overwhelmed.
[00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:03.364]  There's no hospital beds.
[00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:04.224]  There's no medicine.
[00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:06.205]  You're waiting 48 hours to just to get in.
[00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:07.385]  Most people are being rejected.
[00:08:09.062 --> 00:08:12.163]  And so for an entire week, we took calls from healthcare workers.
[00:08:12.883 --> 00:08:17.424]  I went to three different hospitals in Austin, and they were ghost towns.
[00:08:18.084 --> 00:08:19.444]  You could hear a pin drop.
[00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:23.425]  I filmed it all.
[00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:25.725]  Others went out, did the same thing.
[00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:26.925]  For a whole week, we did this.
[00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.026]  We took calls for a whole week.
[00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:28.926]  Others filmed it.
[00:08:29.066 --> 00:08:34.307]  It was a viral sensation on the internet of people going to the hospitals, walking in, saying, where is the overwhelmed?
[00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:37.308]  Hospital, where's all the people waiting?
[00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:39.149]  All of them ghost towns, everywhere!
[00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:45.551]  And then security comes and rushes them up, rushes them out, hushes them up, because, well, we can't expose the false narrative.
[00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:58.214]  So, I want to get ahead of this false narrative today, and I want to take calls from healthcare workers for the entire show, from across America, or hell, if you're overseas, are you seeing
[00:08:59.463 --> 00:09:00.525]  Another push.
[00:09:02.328 --> 00:09:03.670]  Is your hospital overwhelmed?
[00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:05.513]  Is your hospital crowded?
[00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:07.756]  Are people waiting 48 hours to get inside?
[00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:10.661]  Are people being turned down because there's no beds?
[00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.387]  Are people being turned down because it's too crowded, too busy, there's no doctors?
[00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:20.462]  Are the nurses getting all limbered and stretching for their new dance routines?
[00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:22.202]  I mean, this is how ridiculous it is.
[00:09:22.702 --> 00:09:27.543]  They claim the hospitals are so overwhelmed, yet all you saw from nurses was dance routines.
[00:09:28.023 --> 00:09:31.464]  And they think we're so stupid that we won't even put two and two together.
[00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:37.205]  Like, hey, you say the hospitals are overwhelmed, but all you're doing is dancing for TikTok videos.
[00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:41.426]  Remember they sent the Navy ships
[00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:49.159]  The big ginormous Navy ships and not a single patient, not a single COVID patient went on them.
[00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:50.739]  Not a one.
[00:09:56.181 --> 00:09:58.282]  So this is what we're going to do today.
[00:10:00.003 --> 00:10:01.964]  I want to go for the entire Sunday.
[00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:06.001]  Alex Jones Show, taking calls from healthcare workers specifically.
[00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:08.123]  Is your hospital overwhelmed?
[00:10:08.363 --> 00:10:09.604]  Are people being pushed out?
[00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:11.266]  Are people waiting out the door?
[00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.068]  Is there a 48-hour wait?
[00:10:13.428 --> 00:10:17.171]  Or is this just yet another lie of the mainstream media?
[00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:20.715]  Another lie of what I guess are just Democrat doctors?
[00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:21.515]  Because remember,
[00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:27.838]  Democrats that are members of the media have completely sold out their profession.
[00:10:28.178 --> 00:10:29.600]  They're no longer reporters.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.181]  They're no longer journalists.
[00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:32.643]  They're no longer truth-tellers.
[00:10:32.943 --> 00:10:35.466]  They are full-blown activists for the Democrat Party.
[00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:37.608]  They cover up the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:39.730]  They cover up Joe Biden's dementia.
[00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:40.752]  I could go on.
[00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:51.748]  So just like reporters and journalists have completely sold out their profession for the Democrat Party, now you're seeing doctors doing the same thing.
[00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:53.549]  Nurses doing the same thing.
[00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.651]  And you know, that hurts even worse.
[00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:59.994]  We're used to the media in this country being totally corrupt.
[00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.015]  That's why InfoWars exists.
[00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:05.877]  That's why, despite all the censorship, InfoWars is still on air.
[00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:11.281]  Because we're necessary and people fund us because they know we're needed in this time of fake news.
[00:11:12.742 --> 00:11:20.807]  But boy oh boy, you'd think you could at least have some integrity in the healthcare profession, have doctors that don't want to be liars, but guess what?
[00:11:20.887 --> 00:11:24.369]  I guess Democrats, no matter what profession they're in, they're liars!
[00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:33.355]  Whether they're doctors, whether they're nurses, whether they're reporters, whether they're teachers, they've all sold out to the Democrat Party cult, they've all sold out to the deaf cult.
[00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:39.111]  And they don't give a damn what it does to their profession.
[00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:40.812]  So now I can't believe I'm saying it.
[00:11:40.872 --> 00:11:41.953]  I'm heartbroken at this.
[00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:54.339]  Doctors are now selling out their profession for the Democrat Party, and they're going to start pushing the false narrative that the hospitals are overwhelmed from Delta and COVID because you didn't get vaccinated.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.240]  How disgusting!
[00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:59.122]  Yeah, here's the overwhelmed hospitals last summer, guys.
[00:11:59.422 --> 00:12:00.022]  Woo!
[00:12:00.463 --> 00:12:01.083]  Yeah!
[00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:02.544]  We're curing COVID!
[00:12:02.824 --> 00:12:04.585]  Yeah, we're overwhelmed here!
[00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:05.465]  Let's get it!
[00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:07.746]  Let's get our COVID dance routine on!
[00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:10.988]  This is a cult.
[00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:15.630]  So, they're gonna bring it back.
[00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:27.075]  They're gonna bring it back, and they're gonna tell you hospitals are overwhelmed from Delta, just like they lied last year and said they were overwhelmed from COVID while they all danced on TikTok with choreographed dance routines.
[00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:31.433]  I wish I had time to choreograph a dance routine.
[00:12:31.753 --> 00:12:32.993]  Boy crew, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:12:33.914 --> 00:12:39.355]  Wouldn't that be nice if things slowed down in the info war and we could choreograph a dance routine for Twitter?
[00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:40.736]  Wouldn't that be fun, guys?
[00:12:42.296 --> 00:12:43.016]  That would be great.
[00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:45.817]  Hell, we don't even have time to take a day off if we're sick!
[00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:54.080]  Oh, but those nurses are so overwhelmed, making more money than they've ever made to dance on TikTok.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.220]  So I want to get out ahead of this false narrative.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:05.042]  Again, Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin, says every person in Austin is going to be in an ICU by the end of the month.
[00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:15.003]  I mean, that is so insane, so ludicrous, and he has the gall to actually make that a public statement.
[00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:19.064]  Get him off my screen!
[00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:24.445]  What a piece of absolute shiitake mushrooms.
[00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:26.598]  God, he sucks!
[00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.501]  You Democrats, you just, you're the worst people on Earth, man.
[00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:37.343]  Like, I've got a video, I'm not even going to have time to get to it today.
[00:13:39.524 --> 00:13:53.711]  There was a rally in New York City, you know, justice for Ashley Babbitt, justice for the political prisoners from January 6th at the Democrat Party, and Antifa decides to show up and throw water at people and assault people, and the cops just stand by and let them do it.
[00:13:55.435 --> 00:14:01.297]  Instead of moving in and just smashing their skulls like the scum they are, they just sit there and they just let them torture people in the streets.
[00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:04.458]  And it just makes me sick.
[00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:13.821]  So when we come back, I'm gonna give out the phone number for healthcare workers only.
[00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:20.863]  Are you saying your hospital is overwhelmed or is it just like last summer when they lied about it and the hospitals were completely empty?
[00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:28.294]  Alright, I'm going to take calls from healthcare workers for the rest of this transmission.
[00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:32.375]  And then I've been told we have a special report coming up from Alex Jones.
[00:14:32.395 --> 00:14:35.716]  We're going to air it at the end of today's transmission as well.
[00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:44.199]  But for the next hour and a half, I want to take calls specifically from healthcare workers
[00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:53.206]  Are your hospitals overwhelmed, or is the media lying, just like they did last summer, to drum up the fear?
[00:14:53.846 --> 00:15:00.032]  And here's the next level of the fear-mongering that nobody really talks about, but it's very apparent.
[00:15:00.993 --> 00:15:05.337]  And if there is some sort of an influx at hospitals, this is why.
[00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:12.841]  There's this new brainwashing propaganda is that, oh, if you get sick, you're dead.
[00:15:13.422 --> 00:15:14.243]  You're just dead.
[00:15:14.303 --> 00:15:15.144]  That's it for you.
[00:15:15.244 --> 00:15:16.144]  You've got a virus.
[00:15:16.164 --> 00:15:16.625]  You're dead.
[00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:17.266]  You're kaput.
[00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:18.006]  That's it.
[00:15:18.046 --> 00:15:19.107]  You don't have an immune system.
[00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:19.928]  You can't recover.
[00:15:20.248 --> 00:15:21.429]  There's no medicine that can help.
[00:15:21.489 --> 00:15:22.110]  You're just dead.
[00:15:22.651 --> 00:15:23.632]  So you better get the vaccine.
[00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:24.933]  Otherwise, you're dead if you get a virus.
[00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:27.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.362]  Oh boy, I don't even want to go back into that story.
[00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:31.904]  It's one of the sickest things you've ever seen.
[00:15:32.324 --> 00:15:39.171]  I'm telling you, man, these liberal progressive Democrats are really reaching next level of demonic possession.
[00:15:40.752 --> 00:15:44.556]  When they're just, they got somebody in that hospital bed and they're ready to murder them.
[00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:46.378]  They're ready to murder them.
[00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.753]  By putting them on a ventilator.
[00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:50.435]  And they love it.
[00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:52.077]  They get joy out of it.
[00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:54.821]  And they write stories about how much they love it.
[00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.563]  Like, yeah, I'm too late for you.
[00:15:56.783 --> 00:15:57.404]  You're dead.
[00:15:57.584 --> 00:15:58.926]  And they go in with that ventilator.
[00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:02.952]  I've got another COVID death count now.
[00:16:04.253 --> 00:16:05.195]  And they love it.
[00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:16.442]  You know, you don't want to talk bad about our healthcare workers and our doctors because they're some of the best amongst us, but we gotta be honest about what's happening.
[00:16:16.983 --> 00:16:27.432]  The same phenomenon we've seen in the media with Democrats in the media completely selling out the truth for the Democrat Party, now you're seeing Democrats in the healthcare field are doing the exact same thing.
[00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.015]  And I'm sorry to say, but it's true.
[00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:37.362]  A Democrat doctor is now willing to lie about COVID, lie about hospitals, and lie about a vaccine.
[00:16:38.983 --> 00:16:39.703]  Really tragic.
[00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:41.563]  But that's where we are.
[00:16:43.063 --> 00:16:46.044]  And I've got the 10 stages of genocide right here.
[00:16:47.724 --> 00:16:50.265]  And we'll show you where the Democrat Party is out on it right now.
[00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:56.466]  You better watch out, the Democrat Party is at stage 8 out of the 10 stages of genocide.
[00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.137]  They are on Stage 8 right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:05.217 --> 00:17:07.059]  Persecution, beginning of murders.
[00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:08.120]  Ashley Babbitt.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.641]  Theft of property.
[00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:11.322]  I mean, where'd it even go?
[00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:12.903]  Roger Stone, Rudy Giuliani.
[00:17:14.405 --> 00:17:15.486]  Trial massacres.
[00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:18.048]  Yeah, look at all the January 6th people being held without bail.
[00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.329]  They're on Stage 8.
[00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.590]  You know what Stage 9 is?
[00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:23.232]  Extermination.
[00:17:26.072 --> 00:17:34.718]  And when you've got Democrat doctors willing to lie about what's happening in this country right now when it comes to hospitals and health, we're in big, big trouble.
[00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:36.340]  Oh, and by the way, I've got this.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.082]  Here's your old school Nazi propaganda.
[00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:43.571]  I'm telling you, man, you'd almost think the Nazis are running the Democrat Party at this point.
[00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:44.351]  I'm not even kidding you.
[00:17:44.972 --> 00:17:51.880]  Here's your old Nazi propaganda where they showed Jews as maggots and Jewish people with maggots crawling all over them.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.723]  This was the propaganda the Nazis put out against the Jews.
[00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:58.267]  Look at the propaganda Democrats are putting out against Trump supporters.
[00:17:58.307 --> 00:17:58.907]  Here's a maggot.
[00:17:59.628 --> 00:18:00.868]  So there you go, maggots right there.
[00:18:01.189 --> 00:18:03.830]  And then here's a Trump supporter covered in maggots and bugs.
[00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.171]  It's the exact same propaganda the Nazis used against the Jews.
[00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.652]  So what do you think they're going to do to us next, guys?
[00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:11.452]  Oh, it's a mystery.
[00:18:11.652 --> 00:18:12.933]  I can't figure it out, Owen.
[00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.834]  What do the Democrats have planned for us?
[00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:21.976]  Well, if they can't arrest all of us, they'll kill all of us and they'll feel great about it.
[00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:23.917]  Oh, and by the way,
[00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.892]  Yes, the vaccine does kill people.
[00:18:27.292 --> 00:18:29.113]  Even if it's rare, it does kill people.
[00:18:29.173 --> 00:18:33.055]  So, if you force me to take a vaccine, that's attempted murder!
[00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.477]  How does that feel?
[00:18:35.617 --> 00:18:40.739]  All of you out there pushing the vaccine to be guilty of attempted murder.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.380]  Must be nice.
[00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:46.823]  So, without further ado, the phone number.
[00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:47.803]  Guys, put it on the screen.
[00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:48.644]  I want to make sure I get it right.
[00:18:49.718 --> 00:18:49.778]  877-789-2539.
[00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:49.838]  877-789-2539.
[00:18:49.858 --> 00:18:53.422]  Healthcare workers, nurses, doctors, anybody that works in a hospital or has friends and family that work in a hospital, 877-789-2539.
[00:19:05.416 --> 00:19:06.857]  Are the hospitals overwhelmed?
[00:19:07.277 --> 00:19:08.978]  Are the ICU beds overwhelmed?
[00:19:09.158 --> 00:19:11.280]  Are the hospitals just shutting down?
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.140]  They don't know what to do.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.641]  48-hour wait times.
[00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:16.202]  Nobody can get in, just like they claimed last summer.
[00:19:16.603 --> 00:19:20.565]  Or is it just yet another lie of the mainstream media and the Democrat Party?
[00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:23.607]  Because this is going to be their next narrative.
[00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:25.888]  Hospitals are overwhelmed.
[00:19:26.008 --> 00:19:27.509]  It's your fault you're not vaccinated.
[00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.311]  FDA approval of the vaccine.
[00:19:31.144 --> 00:19:32.104]  Mandate the vaccine.
[00:19:33.065 --> 00:19:39.867]  That's the phase and the three stages of this phase that we're in right now when it comes to this global medical tyranny.
[00:19:40.427 --> 00:19:48.410]  So again, healthcare workers or family and friends of healthcare workers that can answer this question, let's get out ahead of this narrative because I'm telling you it's where they're going next.
[00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.411]  Are the hospitals overwhelmed or is it yet another lie of the mainstream media?
[00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:58.053]  Yeah, I mean, the crew could probably start pulling up some of the stories that have been developing this month.
[00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:01.050]  But they haven't done their full push.
[00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.874]  They've just been kind of getting you ready for it, greasing the skids, priming the pumps.
[00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:09.758]  But eventually they're just going to come out and it's going to be the same thing as last year.
[00:20:10.378 --> 00:20:12.120]  Oh, the hospitals are totally overwhelmed.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.102]  It's the worst thing we've ever seen at the hospitals.
[00:20:14.162 --> 00:20:15.423]  It's total chaos.
[00:20:15.443 --> 00:20:16.184]  48 hour waits.
[00:20:16.244 --> 00:20:17.285]  Nobody can even get in.
[00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:19.447]  Doctors working seven days a week.
[00:20:19.507 --> 00:20:20.107]  No breaks.
[00:20:20.408 --> 00:20:22.610]  Nurses falling over from their dance routines.
[00:20:25.146 --> 00:20:27.247]  Or will it just be another lie like they did last year?
[00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:28.047]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:35.370]  Like last year when we had, I mean, what, hundreds, thousands of people going to their local hospitals filming that they were totally empty, totally ghost towns?
[00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.171]  Didn't stop the mainstream media from lying about it.
[00:20:38.251 --> 00:20:40.892]  Didn't stop liberal progressive Democrats from believing the big lies.
[00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:45.714]  No, they still went with it because that's what liars do.
[00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:46.874]  That's what criminals do.
[00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:48.815]  That's what brainwashed cults do.
[00:20:50.646 --> 00:21:08.025]  And man, oh man, you never thought you'd see the day where doctors and nurses, healthcare workers, should be the most uplifted, some of them uplifted among us, would sell out the truth, sell out their profession for the Democrat Party agenda and narrative.
[00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:11.950]  The globalist, the conquering of the world agenda.
[00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:14.262]  But they're doing it!
[00:21:14.802 --> 00:21:27.414]  So just get, wait, you'll see, you'll see man, they'll be going on television, they'll be going on Fox News, they'll be going on CNN, and it'll be doctors saying the hospitals are all overwhelmed because you didn't get a vaccine.
[00:21:29.236 --> 00:21:32.339]  And folks, this is why InfoWars has to be on air, because nobody else is going to do this.
[00:21:33.898 --> 00:21:57.390]  And you'll watch, most of the people that go on Fox News, and I don't want to say all of them, because there's great people that go on Fox News, and you know, I don't have to say your name, you know who they are, but most of the people will go on Fox News and sell you the same BS that, yep, the hospitals are overwhelmed, it's because you didn't get vaccinated, because they know where their bread is buttered, and big pharmaceutical ad buys purchase, they spend more money on television ads than any other industry combined.
[00:21:58.311 --> 00:21:59.311]  So that's what you're going to get.
[00:22:01.472 --> 00:22:02.513]  Not here, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.221]  Emergency food supplies.

[00:22:44.587 --> 00:22:45.327]  Something you need.

[00:22:48.668 --> 00:22:49.349]  Man, oh man.
[00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:49.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:22:50.919 --> 00:23:06.728]  There is so much news breaking that is devastating to the globalist if it can only get out there but I'm gonna have to put it all on hold till tomorrow because I want to get out ahead of their next big narrative which is that the hospitals are overwhelmed because people are unvaccinated.
[00:23:08.639 --> 00:23:21.224]  I mean, I'm just going to bet on history repeating itself that just like last summer when they said the hospitals were overwhelmed and I went to the three hospitals in Austin that they claimed were overwhelmed, they were all ghost towns.
[00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:28.408]  We did full weeks of coverage taking calls from not just healthcare workers but people who went in and filmed their own hospitals that were totally ghost towns.
[00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:29.268]  You could hear a pin drop.
[00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:38.376]  We can't let them get away with these big lies to bring in global tyranny, medical tyranny, and that's the agenda here.
[00:23:38.436 --> 00:23:41.378]  So, we're going to go to the phone lines now.
[00:23:42.038 --> 00:23:43.959]  Again, we're talking to healthcare workers.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.463]  Are your hospitals overwhelmed by new COVID or Delta cases?
[00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:54.188]  I mean, I could be saying, are they unvaccinated?
[00:23:54.268 --> 00:23:55.909]  But we already have the data on that.
[00:23:56.349 --> 00:24:02.991]  Most of the new COVID or Delta variant admissions into the hospitals are vaccinated people.
[00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:10.974]  It's about 70 to 80%, depends on what age group, it's about 70 to 80% vaccinated people going to the hospital.
[00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:15.796]  And it's the same ridiculous notion that just proves they're such liars.
[00:24:17.256 --> 00:24:18.257]  If you're vaccinated,
[00:24:19.642 --> 00:24:20.622]  Why are you afraid?
[00:24:20.722 --> 00:24:25.003]  If it protects you, if it's safe and effective and you're vaccinated, then what are you so afraid of?
[00:24:25.043 --> 00:24:26.924]  If you're wearing your mask, what are you so afraid of?
[00:24:27.324 --> 00:24:28.704]  It's all propaganda.
[00:24:28.744 --> 00:24:30.145]  They've bought into the cult.
[00:24:30.745 --> 00:24:32.526]  Sad to say, they've bought into the cult.
[00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:36.887]  So, we start with Jerry, has called in from Pennsylvania.
[00:24:36.947 --> 00:24:38.767]  Jerry, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:38.787 --> 00:24:39.167]  Go ahead.
[00:24:40.748 --> 00:24:41.968]  Hey Owen, how are you?
[00:24:42.768 --> 00:24:44.009]  Hey Jerry, what are you seeing?
[00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:46.749]  You said you're a sales guy in a hospital.
[00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:48.810]  What are you seeing in the hospitals in Pennsylvania?
[00:24:49.778 --> 00:24:51.919]  Yep, Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.264]  I go to the ORs all the time, but they were talking about it in the doctor's lounge last week.
[00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:03.926]  Zero cases are in the hospital, and it's the designated COVID hospital.
[00:25:05.047 --> 00:25:08.469]  Oh, so it's a whole hospital dedicated to COVID, and it's empty?
[00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:08.989]  No, no, no.
[00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.351]  No, there's three hospitals in Scranton.
[00:25:11.411 --> 00:25:18.455]  Out of the three, it is the location where they would take you if you were a COVID patient.
[00:25:19.681 --> 00:25:20.562]  And there was zero.
[00:25:22.403 --> 00:25:24.384]  So the COVID hospitals are empty, gotcha.
[00:25:25.764 --> 00:25:27.225]  In Scranton, yes.
[00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:31.367]  Joe Biden's supposed at hometown, which is another... Right, right, right.
[00:25:31.507 --> 00:25:32.628]  The Scranton kid.
[00:25:33.768 --> 00:25:35.149]  Yeah, total baloney.
[00:25:36.308 --> 00:25:39.389]  By the way, I've got a clip from Joe Biden I'll play before the end of the day.
[00:25:39.429 --> 00:25:42.610]  This is going to make you laugh so hard you may urinate yourself.
[00:25:43.171 --> 00:25:44.031]  I'm not even kidding you.
[00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:46.172]  Of all, no, no, no, I'm serious.
[00:25:46.552 --> 00:25:52.814]  Of all the Joe Biden flummoxes and fumbles and bumbles, he's gone to new lengths.
[00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:55.415]  In fact, I may even issue a challenge.
[00:25:55.515 --> 00:25:57.436]  I got to focus on the issue today.
[00:25:57.456 --> 00:26:02.318]  But I mean, if anybody can translate what Joe Biden says in this video clip,
[00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:05.399]  I mean, it's like you deserve an award.
[00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:09.661]  I mean, he needs a translator, but we'll do it radio-tease, we'll do that later.
[00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:11.102]  Anything else, Jerry?
[00:26:12.142 --> 00:26:18.945]  Yeah, could I say one other thing not related to the... Sure, make it quick, because I gotta get healthcare workers on the air.
[00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:20.386]  Yep.
[00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:24.528]  Joe Biden, you know, he does say he's from Scranton, which is total nonsense.
[00:26:24.888 --> 00:26:30.391]  I mean, he might have come here back and forth with his parents to his grandparents to visit,
[00:26:31.286 --> 00:26:35.748]  Not from here, but the day before the election, he was here.
[00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:38.369]  Twelve people came to see him.
[00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:38.849]  Twelve.
[00:26:39.709 --> 00:26:41.150]  Wow, that's a big turnout from Joe.
[00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.250]  Yeah.
[00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:54.275]  Well, Donald Trump came, and there's a back road from the airport down into a small town by the name of Old Forge, and there's a company there by the name of Mariotti Lumber.
[00:26:54.856 --> 00:26:59.057]  But lining the road on the back road, there had to be 80, 90,000 people signed
[00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:04.862]  There's no way he lost Lackawanna County in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:05.342 --> 00:27:08.283]  And there's no way Joe Biden won his hometown.
[00:27:08.463 --> 00:27:11.764]  Yeah, there's no way Joe Biden got 80 million votes, let alone 70 million votes.
[00:27:11.924 --> 00:27:12.625]  And they've been caught!
[00:27:12.685 --> 00:27:14.405]  I mean, they've literally been caught.
[00:27:14.445 --> 00:27:17.386]  They got caught now with the audits in Georgia and Arizona.
[00:27:17.486 --> 00:27:27.010]  If we have audits in Michigan that are statewide and Wisconsin and in Pennsylvania, it'll turn out Trump actually won the election by a landslide.
[00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.851]  And so, of course, that's why the Democrats are doing everything they can to fight those audits.
[00:27:32.096 --> 00:27:33.877]  Hey, one other thing on the COVID.
[00:27:34.537 --> 00:27:42.280]  Sales representatives like myself, and I've been doing this for close to 30 years, we have to swipe our, we get a card.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:50.563]  It's a credentialing card, either Simpler, VendorMate, it depends what area you're in, but it's tied to the government.
[00:27:51.143 --> 00:27:55.244]  And they're talking about adding the vaccine to that card.
[00:27:55.624 --> 00:27:59.866]  So everybody who's within the medical industry who has to go into the hospital,
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.681]  is going to be forced to get that or you're going to be out of job after 29 years.
[00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:10.222]  Oh yeah, they're just rolling out all the medical tyranny right now.
[00:28:11.103 --> 00:28:12.063]  It's all coming.
[00:28:12.523 --> 00:28:13.363]  Absolutely, Jerry.
[00:28:13.423 --> 00:28:14.803]  Thank you so much for the phone call.
[00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:20.505]  Let's go to James in Long Beach, a health care worker.
[00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:21.925]  James, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:21.945 --> 00:28:22.345]  Go ahead.
[00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:24.146]  Hey, good afternoon, Owen.
[00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:24.766]  This is James.
[00:28:25.286 --> 00:28:25.646]  Howdy.
[00:28:25.746 --> 00:28:29.647]  Anyway, long time listener, first time caller, always wanted to say that on the air.
[00:28:30.188 --> 00:28:30.588]  There you go.
[00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:31.228]  Oh, it's true.
[00:28:31.589 --> 00:28:32.289]  Oh, it's true.
[00:28:32.449 --> 00:28:34.650]  There are empty beds in California.
[00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.051]  Don't believe the narrative.
[00:28:36.591 --> 00:28:40.953]  I was telling your call screener, you know, I work in a 59 bed facility.
[00:28:41.433 --> 00:28:42.674]  We only have 40 patients.
[00:28:42.734 --> 00:28:44.554]  That's what, almost 20 empty beds.
[00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:49.456]  We haven't had a COVID patient in our hospital since probably February.
[00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:50.877]  And that was a post-COVID.
[00:28:50.897 --> 00:28:55.059]  You know, that's somebody that got sick, survived, ended up, you know, in our hospital.
[00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:59.461]  You know, and the other thing I was gonna try and tell her, but I'll tell you,
[00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:07.640]  Yeah, some of it was improper ventilator usage.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.843]  Another part of it was just poor nursing care.
[00:29:10.403 --> 00:29:17.592]  And then we also have staffing issues because what ended up happening is a lot of our nurses went out of state for big cash bonuses.
[00:29:17.612 --> 00:29:18.953]  They went to your state, Texas.
[00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:28.945]  I'm glad that you mentioned that too because I mean I feel that I'm fortunate enough I can rely on my immune system but I was pretty sick over this weekend
[00:29:40.658 --> 00:29:40.858]  I don't
[00:29:57.469 --> 00:30:02.993]  That I feel like, okay, I can go to the hospital or go to a doctor and, hey, you know what, they're going to prescribe me something that's going to make me better.
[00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:09.757]  I could maybe get some ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or something that they know is going to help you beat this thing in 24 hours, but that's not the case!
[00:30:10.657 --> 00:30:11.458]  That's not the case!
[00:30:11.498 --> 00:30:13.299]  So it's like, why would I even go to a doctor?
[00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:18.202]  Why would I even go to the hospital when I can just lay on my bed for 48 hours and beat this thing?
[00:30:18.262 --> 00:30:20.504]  Not everybody may have the immune system to do that.
[00:30:21.464 --> 00:30:34.069]  But isn't that even, that's exactly what you're saying though is like, I can't even go to a doctor or go to a hospital to get proper care because they won't even give you hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin which has been proven to work.
[00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:40.571]  Through that, you know I always tell people, hospitals are probably some of the most dangerous places anybody can go to.
[00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:43.955]  You know, they could drop you out of a bed and kill you.
[00:30:44.015 --> 00:30:46.017]  They can give you the wrong medication and kill you.
[00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:48.499]  They can give you an additional infection and kill you.
[00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:51.261]  And if you lay in that bed long enough, you'll probably catch a bed sore.
[00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:53.283]  You know, which is what I specialize in.
[00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:57.867]  But, um, yeah, it is kind of a sad story, state of affairs, to be honest with you, Owen.
[00:30:57.887 --> 00:31:00.490]  Um, you know, I've been a nurse 32 years.
[00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.391]  I've seen a lot.
[00:31:01.491 --> 00:31:05.494]  And what I saw in the last year was sad.
[00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:07.056]  That's the only, that's the first word.
[00:31:08.047 --> 00:31:14.070]  Our grandchildren's children are going to look back on this generation and go, what a bunch of knuckleheads and cowards.
[00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.251]  Oh my gosh.
[00:31:15.711 --> 00:31:17.152]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:17.212 --> 00:31:19.293]  I think a lot of people feel that way.
[00:31:19.453 --> 00:31:23.895]  You know, when I articulate that to my coworkers and a lot of them are still scared.
[00:31:24.155 --> 00:31:24.956]  We have coworkers.
[00:31:25.036 --> 00:31:25.816]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:31:26.727 --> 00:31:31.709]  Double mask, wearing gloves at all times with the face visor, and we haven't had a COVID patient in six months.
[00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:34.650]  And they walk around outside like that, virtual signaling.
[00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.872]  So, you know, the people around the area look at them and say, oh, that place must be lousy with COVID.
[00:31:40.252 --> 00:31:41.093]  We haven't had any.
[00:31:41.513 --> 00:31:48.275]  You know, we've had to postpone surgeries because, you know, we couldn't use the OR due to COVID, which was ridiculous, you know.
[00:31:48.295 --> 00:31:52.937]  So, you know, that's probably another reason why people died was because they weren't able to get surgery.
[00:31:52.957 --> 00:31:54.558]  They were in need of cancer treatment.
[00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.871]  Oh yeah, it was that last year.
[00:31:57.032 --> 00:31:57.772]  It was that.
[00:32:17.895 --> 00:32:19.395]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:19.435 --> 00:32:22.136]  We're taking phone calls from healthcare workers.
[00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:26.218]  Are the hospitals overwhelmed from COVID or Delta patients?
[00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:31.739]  Like the mainstream false narrative push is beginning to say.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.841]  And they're going to really force that out probably about two weeks before they think they're going to get the FDA approval.
[00:32:37.981 --> 00:32:42.703]  So that they can really feel justified when they mandate you take that deadly vaccine.
[00:32:44.073 --> 00:32:45.154]  That's attempted murder!
[00:32:45.434 --> 00:32:47.676]  You want to force me to take a vaccine that kills people?
[00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:49.738]  That's attempted murder!
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.821]  Ah, but yes.
[00:32:54.423 --> 00:32:56.504]  We live in the world of medical tyranny now.
[00:32:58.066 --> 00:33:02.770]  And Democrat-Liberal-Progressives have just fully sold out their entire beliefs.
[00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:04.772]  Now they love big government.
[00:33:05.753 --> 00:33:07.274]  Now they love big pharma.
[00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:09.865]  It's so good!
[00:33:09.885 --> 00:33:09.925]  Ah!
[00:33:11.766 --> 00:33:13.907]  Give me the big pharmaceutical tyranny!
[00:33:14.487 --> 00:33:16.548]  Give me the big global government tyranny!
[00:33:16.608 --> 00:33:17.148]  Please!
[00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:18.309]  Please!
[00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.870]  Ah, there's too many humans anyway!
[00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.772]  And Bill Gates says that we can, we can solve that problem with vaccines!
[00:33:26.892 --> 00:33:34.295]  So I think we should trust Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci, who's the number one paid government official, to vaccinate us all to death!
[00:33:35.116 --> 00:33:35.216]  Oh!
[00:33:36.272 --> 00:33:38.653]  There's the latest numbers from the VAERS reports.
[00:33:39.553 --> 00:33:42.254]  Over 11,000 dead from the vaccine!
[00:33:42.974 --> 00:33:45.555]  And you want to force it on me, don't you, you murderer?
[00:33:45.855 --> 00:33:47.575]  You murdering psychopaths.
[00:33:48.215 --> 00:33:55.638]  Maybe if I play some nice, calm, quiet music while I talk about how you want to murder everybody, then it'll be okay.
[00:33:56.898 --> 00:33:56.978]  Ah.
[00:33:57.858 --> 00:33:59.659]  Look, I'm floating.
[00:34:00.479 --> 00:34:03.020]  We'll all float in the end with Bill Gates.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.140]  No, we won't.
[00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.730]  No, we won't.
[00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:12.553]  We will go back to your phone lines, though, and we will take more calls from health care workers that have dialed in.
[00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:16.974]  And we have Jay, who is a nurse, calling in from Alabama.
[00:34:18.135 --> 00:34:20.616]  And Jay, you are on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:20.716 --> 00:34:21.176]  Go ahead.
[00:34:23.037 --> 00:34:24.037]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[00:34:24.237 --> 00:34:24.898]  Thanks for calling.
[00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:26.218]  I was just talking to your call screener.
[00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:27.199]  I was going on a roll.
[00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:29.940]  So I'm a registered nurse in the state of Alabama.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.722]  I've got, I can go many ways with this direction with poison ivy, ivy the terrible.
[00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:41.153]  Um, but, um, been a nurse for several years, 26 years I've been in healthcare.
[00:34:41.173 --> 00:34:45.077]  I also have a degree in occupational safety and health with a minor in industrial hygiene.
[00:34:45.097 --> 00:34:46.518]  So I did ER nursing for about 14 years.
[00:34:46.558 --> 00:34:48.460]  Hey Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.122]  Do me a favor, just slow down a little bit.
[00:34:51.162 --> 00:34:52.263]  Just slow it down.
[00:34:52.283 --> 00:34:53.424]  There we go, brother.
[00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:53.844]  There we go.
[00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:54.345]  All right.
[00:34:54.745 --> 00:34:58.448]  So, um, I didn't know how much time you had trying to practice this conversation.
[00:34:58.488 --> 00:34:58.789]  It's all good.
[00:34:58.809 --> 00:34:59.109]  It's all good.
[00:34:59.209 --> 00:35:03.493]  I'd rather, I'd rather be able to understand what you're saying than, you know, get as many words in as possible.
[00:35:04.298 --> 00:35:05.058]  Got you, got you.
[00:35:05.078 --> 00:35:08.979]  Alright, so my current job, I do medical case management.
[00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:12.239]  I fix a lot of injured workers, get them back to work.
[00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:20.441]  That job entails me from going to go to every hospital from Birmingham, Alabama all the way up to Huntsville, all the way back down the 431 corridor.
[00:35:20.521 --> 00:35:22.441]  So you've pretty much seen the entire state.
[00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:24.101]  You've got a good idea of what's going on.
[00:35:24.702 --> 00:35:25.482]  The entire state.
[00:35:25.642 --> 00:35:32.183]  And it frustrates me to no end that poison ivy gets on the air and terrifies thousands of Alabamians with no proof whatsoever.
[00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:34.734]  So where do I start?
[00:35:34.894 --> 00:35:38.636]  I started a week into the pandemic last March.
[00:35:39.256 --> 00:35:43.778]  Our company kind of put us on a little standby, said you can't go out to appointments.
[00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:46.480]  About a week after that, I started going back out.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:52.403]  I'm Alex's age, but I'm probably more cut like you, so I'm very healthy.
[00:35:52.443 --> 00:35:53.303]  I'm into y'all supplements.
[00:35:53.344 --> 00:35:57.506]  I could go on a whole, you know, different conversation about how wonderful those are, but
[00:35:58.797 --> 00:35:59.899]  Anyway, I started going back out.
[00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:00.941]  I've never worn a mask.
[00:36:01.001 --> 00:36:05.810]  I've always compromised with the doctor's offices or hospitals that I've had to go to, and I put that stupid splash shield on.
[00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.892]  It looks like a welder's helmet.
[00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:09.136]  You know, air can get all around this thing.
[00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:10.719]  But point is, is, um...
[00:36:11.249 --> 00:36:14.871]  Of all the facilities that I go to, I've never seen piles of bodies anywhere.
[00:36:14.911 --> 00:36:17.191]  I've never seen people begging to get in the emergency room.
[00:36:17.231 --> 00:36:20.453]  I've never seen people lined up to get in a hospital being turned away.
[00:36:21.813 --> 00:36:32.498]  Major, you know, people falling out or major cases of, you know, rescue efforts on sidewalks or, you know, the whole narrative that they try to paint to terrify everybody.
[00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:36.599]  So, in other words, you've seen no evidence that hospitals are overwhelmed in Alabama?
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.820]  Zero.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.121]  From being up and down the state?
[00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:41.657]  Correct.
[00:36:41.957 --> 00:36:42.418]  That's correct.
[00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:43.038]  Zero.
[00:36:44.058 --> 00:36:48.600]  The University of Alabama at Birmingham, which everybody calls UAB here, I took a picture.
[00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:52.062]  They established a COVID overflow unit last July, July 2020.
[00:36:53.663 --> 00:37:01.467]  If you come in from a certain way that you enter the hospital, you kind of come in at an upper level and you can overlook this pavilion where they set this COVID overflow unit up.
[00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:08.390]  It was July of last year, a year last year, I took a picture of this thing over that overlook.
[00:37:09.025 --> 00:37:17.713]  And the COVID overflow unit at one o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday consisted of two nurses and an ER tech with their feet propped up on the table playing on their phones.
[00:37:17.973 --> 00:37:21.136]  Okay, so this is the story that's happening everywhere around here.
[00:37:22.537 --> 00:37:24.919]  They have, you know, it's a very left-leaning institution.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:32.426]  Without saying too much, I've got a pretty trusted confidant in the COVID Research Department at UAB.
[00:37:33.046 --> 00:37:34.948]  And I could go on for hours about all the
[00:37:35.629 --> 00:37:41.914]  The discrepancies that are going on, but in a nutshell, they've got several doctors in this department.
[00:37:42.054 --> 00:37:43.855]  One of them, I overheard a conversation.
[00:37:44.476 --> 00:37:49.640]  They're telling people in order to get them to participate in the vaccine trials that one in a hundred people are dying.
[00:37:51.441 --> 00:37:53.643]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:37:53.683 --> 00:37:55.084]  I want to make sure that I heard that correctly.
[00:37:55.124 --> 00:37:58.006]  Just restate what you just said.
[00:37:58.626 --> 00:38:03.170]  Yes, there is a physician in their COVID research department that are telling
[00:38:04.629 --> 00:38:07.334]  Would be participants, that 1 in 100 people are dying from COVID.
[00:38:07.815 --> 00:38:08.957]  I mean, wrap your head around that.
[00:38:09.257 --> 00:38:12.363]  Think about 1 in 100 people walk out into any city sidewalk.
[00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:15.236]  And you would see people lying everywhere with that statistic.
[00:38:15.757 --> 00:38:29.645]  There's another doctor, um, by the name of... And by the way, just to amplify what you're saying, if that were the case, you would have seen a 1% increase in the death rate in the United States in the year 2020.
[00:38:29.705 --> 00:38:39.490]  We did not see a single percentage increase in the death rate, not even a fraction of a percentage, except we saw drug overdoses go up and suicides go up, which I think resulted in a .003
[00:38:42.612 --> 00:38:47.956]  Or a .03% uptick in the death rate from 2019 to 2020.
[00:38:47.996 --> 00:38:48.677]  Correct.
[00:38:49.337 --> 00:38:56.742]  So if it was 1% of people that get COVID are dying in all these numbers, we would have seen at least a 1% increase in the death rate in the United States.
[00:38:56.803 --> 00:38:57.303]  We did not.
[00:38:58.123 --> 00:38:58.644]  Absolutely.
[00:38:59.244 --> 00:38:59.745]  Absolutely.
[00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:09.712]  And the things that they're telling would-be participants over there, the research that UAB is doing on COVID are
[00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.493]  What the pharmaceutical companies pay them to research.
[00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:15.776]  They are not doing any useful studies.
[00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:18.619]  And of course, that just gets whatever they desire.
[00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:19.459]  They just get the result.
[00:39:19.479 --> 00:39:20.881]  They pay for the result they desire.
[00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:21.502]  Exactly.
[00:39:21.742 --> 00:39:22.122]  Exactly.
[00:39:22.162 --> 00:39:22.743]  That's what it is.
[00:39:22.763 --> 00:39:30.471]  So why, if UABs, they're a magnet status hospital, they're a level one trauma center, so they do a lot of different studies between the university and the hospital side.
[00:39:32.356 --> 00:39:33.356]  Simple things.
[00:39:33.817 --> 00:39:35.818]  There's a walking concourse all over the campus.
[00:39:35.838 --> 00:39:42.842]  Why aren't they studying why people are walking down this concourse, touching the handrails, touching the doorknobs, touching the elevator buttons, and not spreading it?
[00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:47.504]  We had a friend of a friend who was at church.
[00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:49.446]  He was in his mid-60s.
[00:39:49.966 --> 00:39:56.129]  He had a condition called pulmonary fibrosis, which is a degenerative condition of the lungs.
[00:39:56.149 --> 00:40:00.412]  It usually happens from former smokers, people being in mines, that kind of stuff.
[00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:03.623]  He went into the hospital a week before last.
[00:40:05.304 --> 00:40:08.065]  They tested him, of course he tested positive for COVID.
[00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:13.068]  I suspect it was probably something from a flu shot that he had received last year.
[00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:21.603]  They had a policy at UAB, once you test positive for COVID, your family member's inpatient, you cannot go into the facility for 21 days.
[00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:29.468]  And then it becomes the tyranny of the quarantine and everything, when most of these PCR tests were false positive.
[00:40:29.488 --> 00:40:32.210]  In fact, again, I've got a story in the news, I'll have to cover it tomorrow.
[00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:40.875]  I think it was out of Europe, they basically did a huge study on the PCR test and showed that most COVID positives were false positives.
[00:40:41.513 --> 00:40:41.773]  Correct.
[00:40:42.154 --> 00:40:45.636]  And that's what they use, they use the PCR, and they told the family this.
[00:40:46.117 --> 00:40:52.101]  Well Jay, look, I gotta bump you, you've been on air a lot, this has been a great caller, I just gotta take other callers.
[00:40:52.902 --> 00:41:02.470]  But you know, let me just say this, because I'm not a doctor, I don't claim to be an expert in medicine, but you know, we're allowed to have common sense, folks, okay?
[00:41:03.885 --> 00:41:12.915]  For a virus to travel from me to somebody else is essentially like man traveling to Mars.
[00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:19.545]  That's the length of distance when you talk about size and scale for a virus to be transmitted.
[00:41:19.746 --> 00:41:24.890]  That virus basically is traveling the distance from Earth to Mars to be transmitted.
[00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:38.141]  So, I mean, yeah, if I'm hanging around people and I'm sneezing on people and they're directly breathing in my sneeze or I'm rubbing my nose and face and all of this and then rubbing it on their hands and then maybe they lick their fingers or something, then yeah, maybe you could spread it.
[00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:39.162]  But I mean, who knows?
[00:41:39.562 --> 00:41:40.963]  How long does it take your body
[00:41:41.977 --> 00:41:50.706]  To start making the antibodies from COVID or whatever else you get that, hey, maybe now I'm not even necessarily spreading the disease, but I'm spreading antibodies, if you even believe that.
[00:41:51.126 --> 00:41:53.008]  Nobody even wants to think about this common sense.
[00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:56.452]  Nobody even wants to try to run tests to try to figure out about this stuff.
[00:41:56.752 --> 00:42:01.477]  They just want to use every different angle, every different way to fearmonger over it.
[00:42:03.424 --> 00:42:07.250]  They were literally putting out graphics saying that COVID can basically fly.
[00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.253]  It's like a ninja virus with a brain.
[00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:12.518]  They just came out, guys, let's see if we can do this in the 20 seconds until break.
[00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:17.726]  They just came out with a study that said COVID is, if you fart, you're spreading COVID.
[00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:18.568]  I'm not even kidding you!
[00:42:20.228 --> 00:42:21.069]  I'm not even kidding you.
[00:42:21.089 --> 00:42:24.171]  They're saying COVID is deadly being spread through farting now.
[00:42:24.572 --> 00:42:26.974]  So what, are we all going to have to walk around in diapers too?
[00:42:27.554 --> 00:42:30.256]  So we all have to walk around in diapers like Biden?
[00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:30.997]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:42:31.297 --> 00:42:32.778]  Can farts transmit COVID?
[00:42:33.607 --> 00:42:34.207]  What a joke.
[00:42:34.968 --> 00:42:36.408]  We're gonna go back to the phone lines here.
[00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:38.109]  I gotta take as many calls as possible.
[00:42:38.169 --> 00:42:39.910]  So just have your call ready.
[00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.912]  And guys, we'll just have to carry over these other clips for tomorrow.
[00:42:44.452 --> 00:42:49.135]  Because I gotta take as many calls and we're gonna have a long special report coming in from Alex Jones actually.
[00:42:49.155 --> 00:42:50.656]  It's gonna take up most of this hour.
[00:42:52.016 --> 00:42:53.717]  But real quick, I have to play this.
[00:42:53.797 --> 00:42:55.278]  Guys, can we play it on repeat?
[00:42:55.298 --> 00:43:00.601]  Because it's a short clip and you won't even really fully appreciate it unless you hear it on repeat.
[00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:01.461]  Have you heard this?
[00:43:02.221 --> 00:43:02.682]  Have you heard this?
[00:43:03.542 --> 00:43:09.304]  I'm telling you guys, look, we know Biden is, you know, it's not a good time, OK?
[00:43:09.464 --> 00:43:13.325]  And you don't want to make fun of old people that have mental problems because it could happen to us someday.
[00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:15.326]  And a lot of us have had loved ones have gone through this.
[00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:16.066]  And it's sad.
[00:43:16.967 --> 00:43:17.447]  But I mean.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.740]  Biden's a corrupt criminal.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:21.761]  They stole our election.
[00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:23.181]  He wants to bring in tyranny.
[00:43:23.221 --> 00:43:24.061]  So, I mean, whatever.
[00:43:24.822 --> 00:43:29.703]  But this may be, I mean, seriously, the guy needs a translator or it's just time for him to resign.
[00:43:29.723 --> 00:43:30.543]  I mean, this is a joke.
[00:43:30.923 --> 00:43:36.605]  So here's Biden on the White House lawn, walking over to the White House press gaggle.
[00:43:38.024 --> 00:43:41.386]  I mean, and just total word vomit coming out of his mouth.
[00:43:41.426 --> 00:43:47.288]  I mean, folks, the guy may not have control of his bowels, and now he's losing control of his motor functions.
[00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:48.629]  He can't even talk.
[00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:50.470]  Listen to this.
[00:43:51.491 --> 00:43:52.331]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:52.871 --> 00:43:53.712]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:55.092]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:55.653 --> 00:43:56.473]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:57.033 --> 00:43:57.874]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:58.414 --> 00:43:59.254]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:43:59.815 --> 00:44:00.635]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:44:00.915 --> 00:44:01.996]  Anybody want to take a guess?
[00:44:02.576 --> 00:44:03.396]  My butt's been wiped.
[00:44:03.436 --> 00:44:04.737]  My butt's been wiped?
[00:44:06.398 --> 00:44:09.360]  My butt's been wiped is the number one guess right now.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.921]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:09.941 --> 00:44:10.341]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:10.361 --> 00:44:11.262]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:11.722]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:12.262 --> 00:44:12.663]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:12.703 --> 00:44:13.103]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:14.044]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:14.104 --> 00:44:15.004]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:15.024 --> 00:44:15.425]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:15.485 --> 00:44:15.885]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:16.586]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:16.606 --> 00:44:17.026]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:17.046 --> 00:44:17.506]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:17.526 --> 00:44:18.067]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:18.087 --> 00:44:18.587]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:18.607 --> 00:44:19.748]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:20.188 --> 00:44:20.989]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:21.009 --> 00:44:21.469]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:21.489 --> 00:44:21.909]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:22.470]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.950]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:23.470]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:24.051]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:24.071 --> 00:44:24.531]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:25.072]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:25.692]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:25.712 --> 00:44:26.232]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:26.252 --> 00:44:27.173]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:27.193 --> 00:44:27.754]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:27.774 --> 00:44:28.494]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:28.514 --> 00:44:29.695]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:29.715 --> 00:44:30.375]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:30.395 --> 00:44:31.356]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:31.376 --> 00:44:31.836]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:32.357]  My butt's been wiped!
[00:44:32.377 --> 00:44:32.417]  My
[00:44:34.144 --> 00:44:35.665]  Guys, I can't!
[00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:38.927]  He's so excited!
[00:44:39.407 --> 00:44:41.708]  He's walking over to the White House press cagle!
[00:44:42.089 --> 00:44:44.170]  He's so excited he just had his butt wiped!
[00:44:45.197 --> 00:44:46.158]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[00:44:46.478 --> 00:44:51.401]  It's a real thing people go through, man, but that's the president apparently, the one they stole the election for.
[00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:52.521]  Unbelievable, man.
[00:44:53.322 --> 00:44:56.343]  His butt's been wiped, so we can all rest easy now.
[00:44:56.884 --> 00:44:58.604]  Biden has a clean behind.
[00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:00.025]  Wow, must be rare then.
[00:45:00.566 --> 00:45:02.447]  All right, back out to the phone lines we go.
[00:45:02.707 --> 00:45:04.668]  Jed called in from Texas.
[00:45:04.748 --> 00:45:06.109]  Jed, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:06.129 --> 00:45:06.469]  Go ahead.
[00:45:09.013 --> 00:45:09.773]  Hey, everyone.
[00:45:09.793 --> 00:45:10.453]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:45:10.573 --> 00:45:18.035]  I'm actually calling on behalf of a dear family friend of mine who was a career healthcare facility administrator for some years.
[00:45:18.295 --> 00:45:25.176]  So, she has the trained eye that you would expect could pick out anomalies in how hospitals are operating.
[00:45:25.676 --> 00:45:36.938]  So, she reports just as of two days ago trying to get care for a dear family member of hers at local area hospitals, and what she found was the
[00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:40.457]  Waiting rooms were stacked and overflowing.
[00:45:40.597 --> 00:45:42.317]  There were people outside waiting in their cars.
[00:45:42.597 --> 00:45:44.578]  All of these were non-COVID patients.
[00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:57.882]  When she was finally able to get an opportunity to talk to a doctor that was on duty at that particular, at one of the bigger hospitals there, she said, she kind of, she was a little bit coy with him.
[00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:02.343]  She kind of pretended like she believed the whole, you know, mainstream narrative of hospitals being swamped.
[00:46:02.383 --> 00:46:05.104]  And she said, you know, I imagine you guys are swamped.
[00:46:05.124 --> 00:46:07.385]  That's why my husband can't get the care that he needs, you know.
[00:46:08.503 --> 00:46:11.166]  The doctor basically said, oh no, no, not at all, actually.
[00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:15.089]  We're averaging like 10 positive COVID tests a day.
[00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:17.691]  And there's nobody in the hospital.
[00:46:17.711 --> 00:46:19.373]  In the whole hospital?
[00:46:19.393 --> 00:46:22.115]  That particular hospital averaging 10 positive COVID tests a day.
[00:46:22.655 --> 00:46:24.637]  And none of those people are being hospitalized.
[00:46:24.737 --> 00:46:26.639]  They're basically, their COVID wing is empty.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:34.846]  And to her trained eye, the way that she, you know, characterized it to me is that it looks very much like they're rationing care.
[00:46:35.666 --> 00:46:45.936]  And they're actually turning non-COVID patients away, ostensibly to create the appearance that the hospital is overwhelmed, when in fact they're not.
[00:46:45.996 --> 00:46:55.365]  And actually, this doctor also said something that's pretty relevant and salient, is that the policies that the hospitals are following are dictated by the administrators.
[00:46:55.926 --> 00:47:00.010]  And the doctors basically have no say whatsoever, they're just following orders.
[00:47:00.836 --> 00:47:00.996]  Yeah.
[00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:08.458]  And so you imagine how easy it must be to take over a whole hospital system if you just only have to control the administrator of each of those hospitals.
[00:47:08.558 --> 00:47:15.779]  And now we know how really all this policy is coming down from the UN, through the CDC, through the hospitals.
[00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:23.501]  So it's all the medical tyranny in the one world government now being forced onto local hospitals through Schadenfreude.
[00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:28.762]  Alright, this is your final segment with me, so I gotta take as many of your calls as possible.
[00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:30.202]  Healthcare workers,
[00:47:32.636 --> 00:47:42.180]  Letting you know whether the hospitals are full or not, because that's going to be the big mainstream false narrative, so that they can justify this mandated vaccine as soon as they can get FDA approval.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.620]  Let's go to Oscar in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.241]  You are on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:47.081]  Oscar, go ahead.
[00:47:47.601 --> 00:47:48.802]  Hey Owen, how you doing?
[00:47:48.962 --> 00:47:49.142]  Good.
[00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:51.663]  Alright, long-time listener.
[00:47:51.683 --> 00:47:57.325]  I support you guys by a lot of products, but I just want you to know, I work in a large hospital in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:57.585 --> 00:48:00.346]  We're tearing down the COVID wings, and all of our COVID wings
[00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:07.100]  They're what's considered negative pressure, so that's to be set up so it pulls the air in, so the COVID doesn't get out of the room.
[00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:20.788]  We're going anywhere from zero to three cases bouncing around, and the whole time out of the ICU where they were actually putting people on the intubators, there was no transmission between the workers.
[00:48:20.828 --> 00:48:23.890]  The nurses, the doctors, no one actually got it from in the ICU.
[00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.773]  I can't speak for the whole hospital, but within that wing I can let you know it wasn't transmitted.
[00:48:30.501 --> 00:48:31.722]  Alright, Oscar, anything else?
[00:48:33.002 --> 00:48:38.004]  Um, yeah, it's just, uh, you know, you were talking about that Dr. Brittany Cobia versus, uh, like a Dr. Charles Hoff.
[00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:45.048]  She made that statement about how people are begging for the vaccine, and you search her name, and there's four pages of everyone carrying the same article.
[00:48:45.668 --> 00:48:51.450]  But there's no mention of this Dr. Charles Hoff who's talking about the T-Dimmer test, you know, and then everything else going on.
[00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:55.572]  So, I mean, I'll just make a quick statement to other callers, but I just want to let you know they're tearing down the COVID wings.
[00:48:55.772 --> 00:48:59.234]  You know, they have to be set up a certain way, and, uh, we're not being overran.
[00:49:00.114 --> 00:49:02.555]  Yeah, I mean, as soon as we stop playing around with this, COVID goes away.
[00:49:02.575 --> 00:49:05.556]  But that's the thing is, that's why it never goes away.
[00:49:06.056 --> 00:49:09.717]  COVID will never go away until they get that forced vaccine.
[00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:12.598]  Then they have the president to mandate vaccines.
[00:49:12.998 --> 00:49:16.839]  And then that's total global government, total medical tyranny.
[00:49:17.139 --> 00:49:18.860]  They can take it anywhere they want from that point.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.260]  That's when we really enter the
[00:49:22.641 --> 00:49:23.822]  The bad zone.
[00:49:24.062 --> 00:49:25.323]  That's when it really gets bad.
[00:49:25.383 --> 00:49:26.704]  Oscar, thank you so much for the call.
[00:49:27.025 --> 00:49:28.466]  Let's go to Wendy in Michigan.
[00:49:28.506 --> 00:49:29.546]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:29.586 --> 00:49:30.407]  Wendy, go ahead.
[00:49:31.788 --> 00:49:33.109]  Thanks for taking my call, Owen.
[00:49:33.129 --> 00:49:44.698]  I'm a nurse outside of Detroit, and I'm not currently working because I can't work under the conditions that they've got nurses working under right now.
[00:49:44.778 --> 00:49:50.582]  But I just wanted to say that the medical system has created
[00:49:51.474 --> 00:50:01.273]  A situation where they've created staffing shortages like the nurse from Alabama stated with all the testing that workers have to go through.
[00:50:02.168 --> 00:50:05.989]  Um, you know, people inevitably test positive with these fake tests.
[00:50:06.429 --> 00:50:06.949]  No, exactly.
[00:50:06.969 --> 00:50:07.669]  That's a great point.
[00:50:07.689 --> 00:50:11.050]  Like, they're doing the same thing at the Olympics, where there's just nothing but propaganda now.
[00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:23.493]  Like, yeah, if you test everybody all day long, you're gonna get false positives, and then they send half the nurses home, it's like, oh, they got COVID, and then they create the false positives, then they create the false pandemic.
[00:50:24.533 --> 00:50:25.013]  Exactly.
[00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:27.174]  And so, my point was that,
[00:50:28.072 --> 00:50:32.694]  The hospitals may be overwhelmed, but it's not with patients.
[00:50:33.174 --> 00:50:34.715]  It's because of staffing shortages.
[00:50:35.195 --> 00:50:45.799]  Because you've got nurses testing positive and having to quarantine or isolate, and then you've got nurses like me who just are not going to deal with this nonsense and we pull out.
[00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:51.982]  So it's going to continue to be like that until more people wake up.
[00:50:52.322 --> 00:50:57.324]  It's gotten to a point where the ratios inside the hospitals are crazy.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:06.129]  You know, one nurse with, um, you know, however many patients, maybe 10 patients at some, you know, in some cases, and, you know, that's just not safe.
[00:51:06.469 --> 00:51:17.081]  And I know one hospital system here, they're paying bonuses of like $1,000 a shift just to get nurses to pick up extra shifts, and they still can't get enough nurses to work.
[00:51:18.766 --> 00:51:20.527]  And it's all a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:51:20.967 --> 00:51:21.968]  Exactly.
[00:51:22.028 --> 00:51:36.238]  When you run, when you test everybody 24-7, doesn't matter if they're symptomatic, asymptomatic, doesn't matter if it's a false positive or not, just do the total panic routine and send them home and then you have the shortage of nurses and then you can say, oh look, the hospitals are in trouble.
[00:51:36.638 --> 00:51:37.879]  Total self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:51:38.239 --> 00:51:39.500]  Wendy, thank you so much for the call.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.302]  Let's go to Steven calling in from Boston.
[00:51:42.402 --> 00:51:43.743]  Steven, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:43.763 --> 00:51:44.103]  Go ahead.
[00:51:45.424 --> 00:51:46.284]  Hi, Owen.
[00:51:46.304 --> 00:51:47.945]  I work at Boston Medical Center.
[00:51:48.045 --> 00:51:56.429]  So, our hospital actually sends out a newsletter that's hospital-wide and basically informs us of statistics every week.
[00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:59.871]  How many COVID admissions there are and how many staff get sick.
[00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:05.233]  And usually the numbers for the patients are in the single digits, if that.
[00:52:10.156 --> 00:52:10.876]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:52:10.896 --> 00:52:12.397]  Are you saying you're going to read the statistics?
[00:52:13.787 --> 00:52:19.173]  Actually, I don't have them in front of me, but week by week, the statistics are always in the single digits now.
[00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:24.999]  Okay, so you're saying that you have the statistics in the hospital and you're not overwhelmed with COVID?
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.360]  Not at all.
[00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:35.730]  When COVID was in full swing, they did limit how many beds were accessible, and then whatever they had left, they then claimed that they had a shortage.
[00:52:36.656 --> 00:52:43.740]  Just to dramatize everything, at the same time, they were telling us for three months not to wear masks because, you know, there's a supply shortage.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.623]  And at the same time, they fought tooth and nail not to pay any of their administrative staff hazard pay.
[00:52:53.506 --> 00:52:54.266]  Anything else, Steven?
[00:52:56.407 --> 00:53:02.991]  Other than my hospital trying to mandate the vaccination, that's going to manufacture another type of staffing shortage.
[00:53:04.858 --> 00:53:05.458]  Oh, no doubt.
[00:53:05.498 --> 00:53:15.263]  I mean, look, right now, I think we have enough data to say that the odds of you dying from the vaccine are obviously very low, probably less than 1%.
[00:53:15.343 --> 00:53:19.765]  I mean, that could change with time, but just in the time and scope that we have now.
[00:53:20.105 --> 00:53:20.945]  But still, it's deadly.
[00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.646]  And I mean, that's attempted murder to me.
[00:53:23.666 --> 00:53:26.748]  And I'm not trying to do fear-mongering here, folks, but I mean, that's just the fact.
[00:53:28.268 --> 00:53:29.629]  Well, I had two people in my clinic.
[00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:33.350]  Both of them had strokes shortly after getting vaccination.
[00:53:34.847 --> 00:53:41.369]  They do have COVID nurses now stationed at every major clinic to issue vaccines to anybody that wants them.
[00:53:42.029 --> 00:53:51.011]  But before that happened, we would hear hospital-wide intercom calls for emergency services for, you know, going directly to the COVID injection site.
[00:53:52.091 --> 00:53:54.112]  And now it kind of diffused those calls out.
[00:53:54.252 --> 00:53:57.233]  So, you know, it's just going to go to those individual clinics.
[00:53:57.293 --> 00:54:01.614]  No one's going to have to care that it's actually going directly to the COVID clinic to care for people.
[00:54:02.393 --> 00:54:07.645]  And you know, most people, it's 99.99% of people that get COVID recover.
[00:54:08.127 --> 00:54:10.612]  Most people they claim have COVID don't even have a single symptom.
[00:54:11.536 --> 00:54:14.118]  You're at a 50-50 shot you get a COVID vaccine.
[00:54:14.138 --> 00:54:16.159]  You're going to have a serious side effect.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.782]  You're at about a 10% chance you're going to have a life-altering side effect.
[00:54:21.263 --> 00:54:28.007]  And you've got about a one or less percent chance of something deadly or you'll never even be yourself again.
[00:54:28.627 --> 00:54:30.769]  So that's what we have this far.
[00:54:31.389 --> 00:54:34.211]  And we're not even a year into this experimental vaccine yet.
[00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.672]  Stephen, thank you for the call.
[00:54:36.032 --> 00:54:38.614]  Let's go to Jared in Arkansas.
[00:54:39.014 --> 00:54:40.635]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:40.655 --> 00:54:41.356]  Jared, go ahead.
[00:54:43.642 --> 00:54:44.204]  Hey, uh...
[00:54:44.867 --> 00:54:46.108]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:54:47.668 --> 00:55:02.316]  I was pressured into getting the vaccine and I haven't had any major side effects, thankfully, but I was just wondering, is there any kind of supplements or vitamins or minerals that I can take to reduce the negative effects of the vaccine?
[00:55:02.376 --> 00:55:13.262]  The only, you know, any sort of heavy metal detoxification or NAC is a supplement that I've heard doctors say that they think helps work to fight back against it is NAC.
[00:55:14.062 --> 00:55:27.992]  But you know what, I don't want to, I should probably maybe get doctors on to do a real just hardcore in-depth analysis of that question alone so that I can be better well-versed to answer it, but right now that's really the best answer I could give you.
[00:55:28.132 --> 00:55:40.200]  I'd just do any sort of normal heavy metal detoxifier, sweat, the NAC is the only supplement I've heard recommended and they tried to ban it and take it off the shelves right before the vaccine came out, so I mean if anything that may tell you that that's the one.
[00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:42.842]  I gotcha.
[00:55:43.915 --> 00:55:44.636]  I appreciate it.
[00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:46.057]  Alright, Jared, thank you.
[00:55:46.137 --> 00:56:08.118]  Alright, folks, I didn't know we were going to have three segments of reports from Alex, so I intended on taking more calls today, but Alex is about to take over the transmission for the rest of this evening, and then of course Sunday Night Live will be hosted by Harrison Smith, and then I'll be double duty all week hosting the Alex Jones Show in the War Room, and I'm going to really get into all the news
[00:56:08.638 --> 00:56:09.639]  Take a bunch of phone calls.
[00:56:09.659 --> 00:56:13.484]  We'll continue to beat this false narrative or whatever the new false narrative this week is.

[00:56:59.221 --> 00:57:00.982]  I will see you tomorrow.
[00:57:02.523 --> 00:57:19.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, the information I'm about to reveal here is the biggest news story and has the greatest impact and import on humanity of any story in the 21st century, in the last 21 years of this century.
[00:57:20.868 --> 00:57:24.490]  This information is as big as Adolf Hitler starting World War II.
[00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:29.432]  It's as big as Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet Union and the crimes they committed.
[00:57:29.452 --> 00:57:31.533]  This is as big as Mao Zedong.
[00:57:32.254 --> 00:57:33.514]  That all happened in the 20th century.
[00:57:34.255 --> 00:57:37.937]  This is the biggest news in the 21st century.
[00:57:38.457 --> 00:57:44.000]  It's 100% documented, hiding in plain view, and we're about to lay it out right now.
[00:57:49.838 --> 00:58:14.551]  Respected international organizations of doctors, physicians, scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, you name it, have formed in the last year and a half all over the world and they've been reviewing studies going back decades and current studies where it was conclusively known in the literature at prestigious facilities like the University of Texas Level 4 Lab in Galveston, Texas by 2012
[00:58:16.112 --> 00:58:30.502]  That if you try to create a vaccine for the protein shell of a coronavirus, it makes the body attack the lungs, brain and heart and create billions of tiny micro blood clots that then start forming larger blood clots.
[00:58:31.142 --> 00:58:45.752]  And what's incredible now is prestigious, respected doctors and scientists and doctors that head up major ERs in Canada and others are seeing in their patients that have been injected with these experimental shots, the exact same thing happening.
[00:58:46.732 --> 00:58:51.235]  Now, I'm going to get to this report, and then I'm going to go through some of the background and show you some of the studies.
[00:58:51.375 --> 00:59:00.301]  But first, do you know who funded the major three-year study at the University of Texas, Galveston, whose name is on the top of it?
[00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:01.922]  Anthony Fauci.
[00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:12.008]  And when they came back to him testing three vaccines that would then attack that protein in the Corona SARS family, same as COVID-19, they said, proceed with extreme caution.
[00:59:12.748 --> 00:59:14.389]  Do not make a human vaccine out of this.
[00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:15.450]  It actually says that.
[00:59:16.485 --> 00:59:24.492]  Now it turns out there are hundreds of prominent studies in the British Medical Journal and the New England Medical Journal and others that all do this.
[00:59:25.392 --> 00:59:40.985]  And all these other prestigious scientists like Dr. Yidan, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, and Wolfgang Wudarg and others went public before this started a year ago and put out emergency injunctions to the EU saying this is going to happen, blood clots, and they still ignored it.
[00:59:41.425 --> 00:59:43.087]  And then you saw the blood clots and the death.
[00:59:43.687 --> 00:59:44.508]  But here's the big news.
[00:59:44.528 --> 00:59:45.789]  I'm going to play this first report.
[00:59:48.869 --> 00:59:55.314]  They keep saying it's rare, it's rare, it's rare when your mom, your dad, your neighbor, your son, your daughter, or you get really sick or die from it.
[00:59:55.755 --> 00:59:56.215]  But it's not.
[00:59:57.376 --> 01:00:03.801]  In the studies of rats, and in the studies of ferrets and other animals, the vast majority develop blood clots and then die within a few months.
[01:00:04.442 --> 01:00:06.884]  In humans, they estimate it'll take a few years because we're a lot tougher.
[01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:08.625]  But it gets worse.
[01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:15.231]  Dr. Charles Hoff, very respected over a whole hospital facility, and has a whole bunch of his own private patients,
[01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:27.989]  Has been having his patients go in and have been given the Moderna, Pfizer and other injections and they're finding exactly what is in the UT studies, the British studies and others with the blood clots.
[01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:28.810]  So many of them.
[01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.771]  It's just incredible.
[01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:34.694]  So here's a nine minute report of him on a doctor's round table report.
[01:00:34.734 --> 01:00:36.895]  And remember, this is being suppressed on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:00:38.056 --> 01:00:40.558]  People with medical degrees, with studies, with science.
[01:00:41.478 --> 01:00:42.359]  And then if you question it,
[01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:49.751]  Fauci and the media say that we're murderers for simply questioning the fact that they're pushing an experimental shot on us.
[01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:51.372]  So, watch this report.
[01:00:53.133 --> 01:00:54.193]  Write this information down.
[01:00:55.276 --> 01:01:03.743]  And while he's speaking, we're gonna be putting on screen some of the mainline studies, again, from top of the line facilities, that found exactly what he's seeing in his patients.
[01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:08.406]  And they're finding this in other hospitals and clinics all over the world.
[01:01:09.047 --> 01:01:17.173]  But they're trying to then gaslight everyone and say, you can't question it, and you must take it, and you must have this vaccine passport, which is the endgame of a global ID.
[01:01:18.314 --> 01:01:18.654]  You spoke to
[01:01:42.614 --> 01:01:45.538]  A potential mechanism of action of the injury.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:51.407]  And you mentioned to me the use of a D-dimer test, which we all know what it's for, but we're going to have to explain a little bit.
[01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:55.653]  Could you please speak to this a little bit and give the relevant context and introduction, please?
[01:01:55.673 --> 01:01:58.417]  Because I think this is really groundbreaking and important.
[01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.351]  Yes, yeah, thank you.
[01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:20.710]  So one of the key things that really bothered me when I started to see serious vaccine injuries in my own patients is that I had no idea what the mechanism of injury was, and therefore, as their doctor, I had no idea how to treat it.
[01:02:21.491 --> 01:02:28.898]  Because, you know, as their family doctor, they would come to me for help and I needed to help them.
[01:02:28.958 --> 01:02:29.838]  And I was clueless.
[01:02:29.878 --> 01:02:31.640]  I mean, this is an experiment.
[01:02:32.261 --> 01:02:41.489]  And I was aware that there was literally what we call iatrogenic disease, a medically induced disease being produced by this vaccine.
[01:02:41.969 --> 01:02:46.933]  And so I had asked this in my open letter to Dr. Bonnie Henry, our provincial health officer,
[01:02:47.814 --> 01:02:53.337]  What is the mechanism of injury and how do I treat this as these people's doctor?
[01:02:53.558 --> 01:02:54.918]  And of course, nobody knew.
[01:02:54.938 --> 01:03:02.983]  And the vaccine manufacturers had told us that the COVID spike protein does not go intravenous.
[01:03:03.043 --> 01:03:11.748]  It stays in the arm, the antibodies to the spike protein are produced in the arm, and that's what we had been found.
[01:03:11.828 --> 01:03:15.631]  But scientists now, and Dr. Brody is actually
[01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:22.414]  Very clearly revealed this, that only 25% of the vaccine actually stays in the arm.
[01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:32.618]  And the rest of it, so these vaccines are a vast number of little messenger RNA strands.
[01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:41.062]  The Moderna vaccine has 40 trillion messenger RNA molecules per vaccine dose.
[01:03:41.082 --> 01:03:41.943]  40 trillion!
[01:03:42.603 --> 01:03:47.284]  So these are wrapped in a little lipid capsule.
[01:03:47.584 --> 01:03:50.685]  The lipid capsule is to enable them to be absorbed into the cells.
[01:03:51.005 --> 01:03:55.146]  So this is injected into the person's arm and their deltoid muscle of the shoulder.
[01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:59.647]  From there, as I mentioned, only 25% actually stays there.
[01:03:59.907 --> 01:04:04.928]  The rest is taken up, collected through the lymphatic system and fed into the general circulation.
[01:04:05.388 --> 01:04:07.849]  And so it circulates around the entire body.
[01:04:08.489 --> 01:04:11.650]  And I think every doctor knows that absorption from the
[01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:18.176]  The circulation occurs in capillary networks because that's where the blood slows right down.
[01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:20.778]  It's going through tiny, tiny vessels.
[01:04:22.019 --> 01:04:36.393]  So, these little nano capsules containing these trillions of messenger RNA molecules are absorbed into the lining around the capillaries, what medically we call the vascular endothelium.
[01:04:37.013 --> 01:04:42.956]  So, these little packages are absorbed into the cells around the vessels.
[01:04:43.236 --> 01:04:44.257]  The package is open.
[01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:53.702]  The body recognizes these messenger RNA strands as a gene and gets to work making COVID spike proteins.
[01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:59.505]  So, in a virus, those COVID spike proteins form part of the viral capsule.
[01:05:00.245 --> 01:05:02.167]  But the problem is they're not in a virus.
[01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:05.530]  They're in the cells around blood vessels.
[01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:11.536]  So as a result, they become part of the cell wall of that cell.
[01:05:12.317 --> 01:05:21.045]  So normally, the cells that surround your blood vessels have to be very, very smooth to enable good and
[01:05:22.526 --> 01:05:24.268]  And unimpeded flow of blood.
[01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:31.716]  But as soon as you've got all these little spike proteins that become part of the cell wall, it's now a rough surface.
[01:05:31.776 --> 01:05:34.118]  It's going to be like a very coarse sandpaper.
[01:05:34.739 --> 01:05:39.924]  It's now what the platelets are going to interpret as a damaged vessel.
[01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:42.066]  It's no longer smooth, it's rough.
[01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:44.669]  So clotting is inevitable.
[01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:50.911]  Because the platelets that come down that vessel are going to hit a rough spot and assume this must be a damaged vessel.
[01:05:50.971 --> 01:05:53.432]  This vessel needs to be blocked to stop the bleeding.
[01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:56.654]  That's how our clotting works.
[01:05:57.114 --> 01:06:10.319]  So clots are, because of this and because of the nature of this, clots are inevitable because of these spike proteins in the capillary networks.
[01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:14.121]  So I set out to then try and prove this.
[01:06:15.261 --> 01:06:16.823]  Could this theory be correct?
[01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:23.747]  And so the problem is these little clots in the capillary networks are microscopic and they are scattered.
[01:06:24.028 --> 01:06:26.429]  So they're not going to show on any scan.
[01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:28.851]  They're just too small and too scattered.
[01:06:29.131 --> 01:06:32.313]  It's not like the big clots that cause strokes or heart attacks.
[01:06:33.334 --> 01:06:35.296]  They're too small and they're too scattered.
[01:06:36.169 --> 01:06:39.111]  So how on earth can we know if the person clotted?
[01:06:39.492 --> 01:06:42.994]  And the only way is with a blood test called a D-dimer.
[01:06:43.474 --> 01:06:48.078]  So the D-dimer is a blood test that will show up a recent clot.
[01:06:48.118 --> 01:06:51.160]  It won't show up an old clot, it shows up a new clot.
[01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:57.265]  And it doesn't tell you where the clot is, it just tells you that the clotting mechanism has been activated.
[01:06:57.905 --> 01:07:12.735]  So I have now been recruiting patients from my practice, people that have come into my office and others that have heard me speak about this and have asked people to do this D-Dimer within one week of their COVID shot.
[01:07:13.175 --> 01:07:25.360]  And so far, and this study is ongoing, these are preliminary results, so far I've got 62% positive elevated D-dimer, which means that the blood clots are not rare.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.882]  That's what the so-called experts keep telling us.
[01:07:29.142 --> 01:07:36.565]  The clots are rare, the big ones are rare, but the small ones are clearly happening in the majority of people, 62%.
[01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:41.127]  Now, I'll tell you what the real concern with this is.
[01:07:42.466 --> 01:07:46.088]  Is that a clotted vessel is permanently damaged.
[01:07:46.528 --> 01:07:49.569]  That vessel never ever goes back to normal.
[01:07:50.389 --> 01:08:01.434]  So if this theory is correct, which it really looks like by these D-dimer results, and I'm told it has been done in Australia and it's been done in the UK and they also found elevated D-dimers.
[01:08:02.254 --> 01:08:08.020]  And they sort of discarded the information because they said there's no clinical evidence of flux.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.863]  Well, the clinical reason is because they're microscopic and they're scattered.
[01:08:11.903 --> 01:08:14.286]  And so you're not going to see clinical evidence.
[01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:27.158]  But in fact, all of the frequent side effects of the shock, which are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, could all be signs of cerebral thrombosis on a
[01:08:27.718 --> 01:08:29.721]  On a capillary level.
[01:08:29.741 --> 01:08:41.714]  I mean, those literally, you could be having thousands and thousands of tiny, tiny little clots in your brain that won't show on a scan, but they will give you those exact symptoms.
[01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:51.405]  So the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice that cannot exert themselves the way they used to be.
[01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:54.229]  What medically we call reduced effort tolerance.
[01:08:54.829 --> 01:09:01.777]  Six people who now get out of breath doing things that they could previously do without any problem.
[01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:10.790]  So I believe that these people blocked up thousands and thousands of capillaries in their lungs, in these six people.
[01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:17.459]  So I believe these people now have permanently damaged lungs, because they have got
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.780]  I mean, and that's why they get out of breath.
[01:09:20.001 --> 01:09:25.642]  I have one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week for a shot for his arthritis.
[01:09:25.702 --> 01:09:28.183]  And he says after a quarter of a mile, he's done.
[01:09:28.263 --> 01:09:31.984]  In other words, his effort tolerance is reduced to one eighth of what it used to be.
[01:09:33.384 --> 01:09:38.446]  And so I've sent some of these people for chest x-rays and CT scans to see what it shows.
[01:09:38.906 --> 01:09:39.467]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:09:53.797 --> 01:10:09.463]  The concern is because these vessels are now permanently damaged in a person's lungs, when the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there's increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs.
[01:10:09.723 --> 01:10:15.545]  So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs.
[01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:20.527]  And the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop
[01:10:21.327 --> 01:10:36.390]  Right-sided heart failure within three years and die because they now have increased vascular resistance through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue and all of that does not regenerate.
[01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:41.931]  In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle and other, but there's some tissues that cannot.
[01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:50.673]  And so this absolutely explains what I've seen in my patients and that's what I'm doing to prove it and my study is ongoing.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.801]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is settled science.
[01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:58.761]  Like a shotgun blast to the chest with a 12-gauge will probably kill you.
[01:10:59.261 --> 01:11:02.442]  Or being run over by a truck going 80 miles an hour will probably kill you or at least hurt you.
[01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:13.644]  What these protein crystals are doing, growing in the body, is killing people in mass, is causing brain fog, is causing heart attacks, is causing strokes, is causing the lungs to bleed out like this.
[01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:16.485]  And that's what all the medical literature said it would do.
[01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:16.905]  That's what
[01:11:17.865 --> 01:11:21.528]  All these scientists and doctors warned what happened before it even began.
[01:11:21.548 --> 01:11:29.215]  And now they've put advisories on all these major vaccines that they can cause blood clots, that they can cause strokes, they can cause heart attacks.
[01:11:29.695 --> 01:11:34.239]  And in much of the world, these so-called vaccines, these experimental shots are banned.
[01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:35.280]  India's not taking them.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.481]  China's not taking them.
[01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:39.724]  Did you know that less than 10% of India is vaccinated right now?
[01:11:40.184 --> 01:11:41.305]  They're refusing to take this.
[01:11:41.825 --> 01:11:41.946]  Now,
[01:11:42.546 --> 01:11:43.648]  Let's talk about the motive.
[01:11:43.688 --> 01:11:47.753]  Dr. Lee Merritt of American Frontline Doctors, one of the best organizations out there fighting this tyranny.
[01:11:48.942 --> 01:12:05.891]  came out in a long report that's on Infowars.com, and she laid out how this is unrestricted warfare by the big banks and the central cartels to destroy the real economy, collapse the third world, and knock out all their competition in the western world, taking out all the small businesses that, again, they call non-essential.
[01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:17.338]  Once those businesses have collapsed, and after the infrastructure's gone for a few years, then they can give us all universal basic income, but with that will come the strings attached that we've gotta
[01:12:18.078 --> 01:12:19.399]  Take the injections they take.
[01:12:19.659 --> 01:12:22.061]  We've got to accept the carbon passports they say they're giving us.
[01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:26.264]  And we have to go under this serious neo-feudalistic control system.
[01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:28.186]  So, that's what this consortium is.
[01:12:28.366 --> 01:12:30.027]  This is a short clip, two minutes long.
[01:12:30.428 --> 01:12:32.369]  The full report, again, is at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:33.850]  I suggest you get it and you share it.
[01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:35.512]  This is Dr. Lee Merritt explaining.
[01:12:35.812 --> 01:12:39.495]  This is 21st century, 5th generational, unrestricted warfare.
[01:12:40.282 --> 01:12:42.784]  That's a worrisome sign.
[01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:53.873]  When I say that I think we're going to have to at some point fight back these guys because this isn't just a war that involves medical issues.
[01:12:54.413 --> 01:13:01.279]  This is a multi-dimensional unrestricted war that we're in that involves cyber security and everything.
[01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:03.679]  You know, economic war, cyber security.
[01:13:03.699 --> 01:13:08.360]  I mean, one of the things that's happening, for example, is food is being allowed to rot on docks.
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.941]  The cost of shipping crates has been jacked up to $20,000.
[01:13:12.441 --> 01:13:18.522]  Used to be two to three, the last 15 years, I have a friend in shipping says two to three years or 15 years, it's been two to $3,000.
[01:13:18.963 --> 01:13:22.563]  And suddenly overnight, it's $20,000 for one of those shipping crates.
[01:13:23.203 --> 01:13:30.565]  So this is a food squeeze, just like they did to the Kulaks in just like the Bolsheviks did to the Kulaks to get rid of the freedom people in
[01:13:31.445 --> 01:13:33.707]  Russia to bring down and create the Soviet Union.
[01:13:34.228 --> 01:13:35.309]  They couldn't get them any other way.
[01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.152]  They starved them and finally disarmed them and killed them.
[01:13:38.212 --> 01:13:49.422]  And I gotta tell you, it's looking more worrisome that this is an active... They're weaponizing the medical corps and they've already weaponized public health.
[01:13:49.663 --> 01:13:53.446]  Now they're turning the military against their own people if this happens.
[01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:57.549]  And that's something we have to understand, that we are not out of this.
[01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:59.791]  I think we will win, but we're not out of this yet.
[01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.753]  The globalists on record want to depopulate the Earth.
[01:14:03.354 --> 01:14:06.116]  Jane Goodall just came out at the Davos Group again and said,
[01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:20.245]  We need to depopulate down to the population we had 500 years ago, which was 500 million, the same number you see at the Georgia Guidestones, put up in the countryside of Georgia, outside Atlanta, by Ted Turner, who's also part of this eugenics cult.
[01:14:20.285 --> 01:14:31.888]  So, mainline science says, if you've had a vaccine that actually works, with real attenuated science, where you get a little bit of the virus or the bacteria, that's either killed or damaged, so it can't hurt you, you learn how to defeat it.
[01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:33.208]  That's not what this is.
[01:14:34.148 --> 01:14:37.049]  Fauci is lying to everyone with bald-faced lies.
[01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:38.910]  Take the PCR test.
[01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:45.613]  They now officially admit the PCR test is 100% fraud, and they're recommending it not be used to quote tests for COVID.
[01:14:45.633 --> 01:14:48.634]  Well, almost 100% were fake positives.
[01:14:49.294 --> 01:14:54.056]  That's why they would count somebody that died in a car wreck as COVID, to again jack those numbers up for fear.
[01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:58.018]  But that's a whole other subject, how every piece of this has been a fraud.
[01:14:58.993 --> 01:15:01.375]  Fauci and his cohorts are on every single channel.
[01:15:01.395 --> 01:15:03.518]  Remember, Fauci owns the patents on these vaccines.
[01:15:03.778 --> 01:15:05.039]  He ran the Wuhan lab.
[01:15:05.379 --> 01:15:08.142]  He's part of the eugenics group that wants to have the Great Reset.
[01:15:08.162 --> 01:15:17.351]  So he has all these conflicts of interest and here he is on every channel saying, if you haven't been vaccinated, you're the reason there's variants and you're the reason other people are getting sick.
[01:15:18.032 --> 01:15:35.249]  But we're putting on screen for you right now, again, some of the most respected and prestigious scientific institutions in the world saying the opposite, including the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winner, that when you give people a so-called vaccine like this, it makes them create deadly variants of the virus.
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:45.495]  In truth, it is Mother Nature taking the COVID virus and turning it into less lethal variants like the Delta, which they now admit has a much smaller size spike protein on it.
[01:15:45.815 --> 01:15:47.076]  People ask, well, how do you know this, Jones?
[01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.737]  I actually read the scientific literature.
[01:15:49.137 --> 01:15:50.597]  Hours a day to understand this.
[01:15:50.938 --> 01:15:55.840]  I've interviewed hundreds of scientists and doctors, and there's a real consensus on this.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.683]  But the real consensus of academics and scientists and virologists is all shut off.
[01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:04.645]  And only people like Fauci get a chance to be on national news fueling their lies.
[01:16:05.365 --> 01:16:12.368]  Well, the impact, Jonathan, is that you're going to have the propagation of an outbreak that will continue to smolder.
[01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:17.250]  So you're going to have suffering on the part of the people who are unvaccinated.
[01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:26.133]  There will be some, not very many we hope, but there will be some breakthrough infections even among the vaccinated.
[01:16:26.193 --> 01:16:32.856]  So as long as you have circulating virus in the community, which is predominantly because
[01:16:33.596 --> 01:16:51.382]  People are not getting vaccinated Then they hurt themselves and you don't want to see that Because among those are people that are gonna wind up getting hospitalized and some of them are going to die That's the individual impact on those who don't want to get vaccinated, but there's a broader
[01:16:52.322 --> 01:17:12.966]  Societal impact, Jonathan, in that if you allow the virus to freely circulate because so many people are unvaccinated, you give it yet again another opportunity to mutate even more, and you may wind up with creating a variant that in fact eludes the protection of the vaccine.
[01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:20.588]  We're very fortunate that even though this Delta variant is a real bad actor in the sense of being highly transmissible,
[01:17:21.408 --> 01:17:29.650]  For the most part, the vaccines work very well against it, particularly in protecting you from severe disease leading to hospitalization.
[01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:33.852]  But you let the virus circulate, you may get a variant that's even worse.
[01:17:34.492 --> 01:17:40.874]  And then when academics try to go online and talk about what's happened, they are censored and they are silenced.
[01:17:41.214 --> 01:17:48.076]  And that's what Professor Martin Koldorf of Harvard Medical School had to say on International TV just a few days ago.
[01:17:49.301 --> 01:17:54.946]  Yes, and I think it already has generated damage because we haven't had an open debate about the pandemic.
[01:17:55.847 --> 01:18:14.765]  And I don't really care if they censor one of my tweets or so personally I don't mind, but when you have those censoring and also slander where journalists or scientists slander other scientists, that means that there are many people in the scientific community who do not dare to speak out.
[01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:34.030]  And among the infectious disease epidemiologists that I know personally and that I discuss things personally with, the majority have the same views with me that we need to focus protection or better protecting older high-risk people while letting, for example, schools to be open and that young people live normal lives.
[01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:43.718]  But that's not reflected in the journalism because there are many of my colleagues who do not want to speak up because they have seen what's happened to those who do speak up.
[01:18:44.778 --> 01:18:47.359]  I don't think they should take my credential into account.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:57.164]  I think that people should be able to express their views freely in society, whoever they are.
[01:18:58.144 --> 01:19:05.768]  And there's actually a lot of people who are not scientists who have very insightful thoughts about the pandemic.
[01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:15.874]  One of the principles of public health, many of which have been thrown out the window during this year, but one of the principles of public health is that you have to listen to the public.
[01:19:16.694 --> 01:19:21.016]  They are the ones who are living through the consequences of the lockdowns, for example.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:34.916]  Where they have family members with mental health issues that they have to deal with, where they couldn't get their doctor to deal with the cardiovascular disease problems.
[01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:37.980]  So it's very important in public
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:50.967]  Unlike other aspects of science, like virology or immunology, where you sort of are focused on the lab and the science, in public health, you always have to listen to the public and have an interaction with the public.
[01:19:51.107 --> 01:19:53.068]  And you have to do it with everybody in the public.
[01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.848]  So you have to be open to speak to everybody.
[01:19:55.789 --> 01:19:56.649]  So here's how it works.
[01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:59.351]  The globals cook up the virus that they own and control.
[01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:01.332]  They release it to create fear.
[01:20:02.554 --> 01:20:06.117]  They then say you must take the vaccine to reopen society.
[01:20:06.778 --> 01:20:11.162]  Then they partially reopened society, but they were always planning to bring the lockdowns back.
[01:20:11.242 --> 01:20:21.611]  And now the head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, says only in Republican areas with our strike teams and the weaponized National Institutes of Health will we have new lockdowns in the fall.
[01:20:22.071 --> 01:20:23.512]  In front of you, there is a crystal ball.
[01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:24.513]  What do you see?
[01:20:50.902 --> 01:20:56.304]  I have to tell you, I personally think that something has gone very wrong in the world.
[01:20:56.384 --> 01:21:01.706]  The whole medical, the bioscientific underpinnings have been broken.
[01:21:01.786 --> 01:21:02.927]  We're off our moorings.
[01:21:03.427 --> 01:21:05.508]  We're not having evidence-based medicine.
[01:21:05.888 --> 01:21:09.089]  We're not seeing reasonable conclusions being made.
[01:21:09.549 --> 01:21:12.910]  We're not even seeing regulatory decisions being followed.
[01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:19.533]  I mean, I gave you the example of, you know, there are regulatory decisions that say COVID-19 testing is only for sick people.
[01:21:20.307 --> 01:21:23.348]  That's not being followed because people are doing it for asymptomatic people.
[01:21:23.368 --> 01:21:30.751]  You know, the vaccines have been offered as an elective offering, and they've been quickly mandated.
[01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:33.152]  So we're seeing things off their underpinnings right now.
[01:21:33.492 --> 01:21:35.653]  There's something going on in the minds of people.
[01:21:35.993 --> 01:21:39.854]  There's almost a worldwide contagion of a neurosis.
[01:21:40.414 --> 01:21:44.816]  A neurosis is some type of disordered thinking that's spreading from person to person.
[01:21:45.016 --> 01:21:47.457]  That's probably more contagious than the viruses right now.
[01:21:47.935 --> 01:22:14.575]  And this disordered thinking is, I think, rooted in fear, distrust, rooted in anxiety, and it's spreading all over the world, making individuals come up with the most ridiculous decisions like not treating the virus early, forcing unsafe vaccines on one another, having vaccines divide the workplace and schools, dividing families, having people wear masks when they're, you know, driving or jogging or swimming.
[01:22:14.775 --> 01:22:16.516]  This type of stuff makes no sense.
[01:22:17.014 --> 01:22:26.023]  My crystal ball is I think we're in for about a three to five year period of turmoil and I think it's mental turmoil in human beings.
[01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:30.987]  The types of things I've seen in the minds of people right now is really alarming.
[01:22:31.688 --> 01:22:35.331]  It's most alarming among colleagues in medicine and medical institutions.
[01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:38.134]  The right decisions are not being made right now.
[01:22:40.563 --> 01:22:46.008]  As this facade begins to collapse, as the truth begins to really come out, what are they doing?
[01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:47.169]  They're doubling down on their lies.
[01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:50.953]  So now Fauci and all his minions are saying 99% of people dying of COVID.
[01:22:53.951 --> 01:22:54.692]  We're not vaccinated.
[01:22:54.872 --> 01:23:05.099]  But whether you look at Australia, or whether you look at Singapore, whether you look at the United States, the vast majority of people at the hospital who they say have COVID and who are dying, ladies and gentlemen, guess what?
[01:23:05.399 --> 01:23:07.941]  We're, quote, vaccinated for COVID.
[01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:15.086]  141 people are in hospital with COVID at present, and 43 are in intensive care, 18 of whom require ventilation.
[01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:17.247]  So this is a very serious disease.
[01:23:18.608 --> 01:23:25.030]  Of those 141, 60 are under the age of 55, and 28 under the age of 35.
[01:23:27.051 --> 01:23:40.916]  And of the 43 people in intensive care, one is in their teens, 7 are in their 20s, 3 are in their 30s, 14 are in their 50s, and 12 are in their 60s, and 6 are in their 70s.
[01:23:41.036 --> 01:23:45.398]  So this is affecting people of all ages with very serious disease.
[01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:47.708]  All but one.
[01:23:47.728 --> 01:23:53.050]  A vaccinated one person has just received one dose of vaccine.
[01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:55.530]  All but one.
[01:23:55.550 --> 01:24:00.872]  A vaccinated one person has just received one dose of vaccine.
[01:24:02.172 --> 01:24:04.873]  Piers Morgan got both shots and then almost died.
[01:24:05.453 --> 01:24:06.553]  And they said it was COVID.
[01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:12.595]  And he said, I credited the fact that I barely lived because I'd taken the so-called vaccines.
[01:24:16.471 --> 01:24:20.026]  Now they've announced all over the world contact tracers are coming to your house.
[01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:26.761]  I have friends and family that have got messages on their phones that you were near someone who may have had COVID-19.
[01:24:27.441 --> 01:24:29.582]  They don't even have apps on their phones to do that.
[01:24:29.643 --> 01:24:32.384]  It's just being sent to them as emergency alert systems.
[01:24:33.025 --> 01:24:37.688]  Google got the contract in the state I live in, in Texas, for billions of dollars to administer it.
[01:24:38.268 --> 01:24:50.757]  And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and, of course, the Clinton Global Initiative are involved in training the operatives that are going to be coming to your house looking for information to report you back to the health department and CPS.
[01:24:51.477 --> 01:24:58.181]  So I would not let them in your house, but I would also not threaten them or be mean to them, or they will file, again, false reports on you.
[01:24:58.321 --> 01:25:08.246]  These are the leading edge of getting used to a federal security force just as big and just as strong as our military, to quote Barack Obama, coming to your home.
[01:25:09.249 --> 01:25:11.850]  And the doorway into all of this is the smartphone.
[01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:23.514]  That's how they create the fake probable cause or the reasonable suspicion to claim someone that was near this nebulous virus was close to you, so now you've got to quarantine your home.
[01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:28.816]  And already, millions of people in the UK, with no announcement, got messages and said, stay in your home.
[01:25:29.176 --> 01:25:32.898]  Even though they didn't have a government app, it's hardwired into all the phones, they're getting the messages.
[01:25:34.406 --> 01:25:45.877]  I've been telling you for a year, and we've sold a lot of them because of it, we've been selling them for a very long time, over a decade, we have high quality Faraday cages that have about a 99% ability to block where you are and what you're doing.
[01:25:46.198 --> 01:25:51.142]  If you're right under a cell phone tower, if you're right there underneath a cell phone tower,
[01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:55.745]  Um, it might go through the Faraday cage, but if you're not right under it, it's not going to happen.
[01:25:56.046 --> 01:26:09.374]  So in live time, when you're driving down the road, or walking down the road, or bicycling down the road, the cell towers, doesn't have to be 5G, but they all do it, are pinging your GPS location and triangulating off of their tower locations, you down to about three feet.
[01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:17.439]  That was put into federal law in 1996, that by 2000, all phones would have that, and all the world is the same system.
[01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:21.992]  So you put the iPhone, you put the Droid, whatever it is inside there, you close it.
[01:26:22.112 --> 01:26:23.593]  That makes you use the phone less.
[01:26:23.613 --> 01:26:27.336]  But if you want to take photos, you want to call somebody, you want to do a voice memo, whatever.
[01:26:27.356 --> 01:26:30.878]  Because even if you have all the apps turned off, they're still watching and listening to you.
[01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:35.501]  So you take it out of its cage when you want to use it like a dangerous rattlesnake.
[01:26:36.421 --> 01:26:38.403]  Or a bull you've got in the pen.
[01:26:38.663 --> 01:26:40.605]  You don't just let the bull walk around your living room.
[01:26:40.865 --> 01:26:43.087]  You don't just let the rattlesnake out in your bedroom or whatever.
[01:26:43.547 --> 01:26:44.268]  Or your backyard.
[01:26:44.528 --> 01:26:45.569]  You have it in a cage.
[01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:49.272]  So you cage the beast to start weaning yourself off of it.
[01:26:50.293 --> 01:26:51.974]  I'm going on quote vacation next week.
[01:26:52.134 --> 01:26:53.355]  I'm not taking the damn thing.
[01:26:53.836 --> 01:26:54.797]  I'm taking a flip phone.
[01:26:55.237 --> 01:26:56.538]  Not that I've done anything wrong.
[01:26:56.938 --> 01:26:59.501]  I'm just training myself to get away from them.
[01:26:59.761 --> 01:27:01.883]  Because they have a lot of great Trojan horse uses.
[01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:06.614]  And it's nice and it's fun, but like drugs, it's poisonous and will kill you.
[01:27:07.443 --> 01:27:12.225]  And so, we're running the special for one more week, because that's how long supplies will last.
[01:27:12.486 --> 01:27:13.886]  We got a big shipment in a few weeks ago.
[01:27:14.246 --> 01:27:16.848]  We did them at 50% off, but they are selling out.
[01:27:16.908 --> 01:27:23.451]  We have them in four different colors, black, blue, red, and green, at infowarstore.com.
[01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:26.593]  The privacy pockets are there at the site.
[01:27:26.613 --> 01:27:27.613]  These are excellent units.
[01:27:27.633 --> 01:27:31.155]  A lot of the other competition are like 60 or 70 or 80% effective.
[01:27:31.695 --> 01:27:34.256]  These are a nice, inexpensive unit that most people sell for $29.95.
[01:27:36.172 --> 01:27:39.455]  We sell it for $14.95 right now.
[01:27:39.895 --> 01:27:40.816]  That is 50% off.
[01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:44.700]  Normally, it's $19.95 when we sell it, and it's there.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.641]  We're very, very proud of it.
[01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.242]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:27:47.662 --> 01:28:01.435]  And on top of that, with every order, you get all 10 of our new bumper stickers, Arrest Fauci, Arrest Gates, COVID-19's a hoax, and this big door knocker's no solicitation sign that says this property charges $50 per minute.
[01:28:02.876 --> 01:28:08.867]  To listen to any vaccine advice, payment required in advance, and it's got more of a message at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:08.968 --> 01:28:14.898]  So, every order of the Privacy Pouch gets all these stickers in it, so get yours right now.
