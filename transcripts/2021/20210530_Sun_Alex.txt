[00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.553]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:33.179]  In an old video from 1995, a theology professor named Pierre Gilbert warned of mandatory vaccines that would turn recipients into zombies.
[00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.234]  He speaks in French, so I will translate.
[00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:43.156]  In the biological destruction, there are the organized tempests on the magnetic fields.
[00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:47.437]  What will follow is the contamination of the bloodstreams of mankind.
[00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.647]  Creating intentional infections.
[00:00:55.647 --> 00:01:00.714]  This will be enforced via laws that will make vaccination mandatory.
[00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:04.240]  And these vaccines will make possible to control people.
[00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:25.623]  The vaccines will have liquid crystals that will become hosted in the brain cells, which will become micro-receivers of electromagnetic fields, where waves of very low frequencies will be sent.
[00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:30.426]  And through these low frequency waves, people will be unable to think.
[00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:31.926]  You'll be turned into a zombie.
[00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.496]  Don't think of this as a hypothesis.
[00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.178]  This has been done.
[00:01:40.178 --> 00:01:44.459]  Think of Rwanda.
[00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:54.564]  There isn't much information I could find about Pierre Gilbert, but what he said 26 years ago certainly rings true today.
[00:01:54.564 --> 00:02:02.667]  In 2016, The Guardian published, Genetically Engineered Magneto Protein Remotely Controls Brain and Behavior.
[00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:11.493]  Here we can see zebrafish larvae that have been injected with Magneto being manipulated with magnetic fields.
[00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:20.404]  In March of 2020, Defense One published an article on how hydrogel biosensors are ready to be injected into people's bodies.
[00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:22.166]  Funded by DARPA and Bill Gates.
[00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:38.464]  If you search magnetic nanoparticles, you will find several articles and videos explaining the so-called benefits of this invasive technology that can control parts of the human body via external frequencies.
[00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:42.406]  Livestock needs to be branded and tracked.
[00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:46.368]  And the enslavement of humanity is voluntary.
[00:02:46.368 --> 00:02:49.530]  Which is why the so-called vaccines are voluntary.
[00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:57.739]  And sadly, there seems to be millions of people eagerly lining up to be state property.
[00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.581]  For ReissReport.com, this is Greg Reiss.
[00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.443]  People talk glibly about science.
[00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:05.204]  What is science?
[00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:16.993]  People coming out of a university with a master's degree or a PhD, you take them into the field, and they literally don't believe anything that this is a peer-reviewed paper.
[00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:18.834]  It's the only thing they accept.
[00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:19.455]  And you say to them,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.681]  Let's observe, let's think, let's discuss.
[00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.301]  They don't do it.
[00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:29.563]  It's just, is it in a peer-reviewed paper or not?
[00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:31.604]  That's their view of science.
[00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:34.285]  I think it's pathetic.
[00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:42.888]  Born into universities as bright young people, they come out of them brain-dead, not even knowing what science means.
[00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:46.249]  They think it means peer-reviewed papers, etc.
[00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.630]  No, that's academia.
[00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:55.230]  And if a paper is peer-reviewed, it means everybody thought the same, therefore they approved it.
[00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:07.237]  An unintended consequence is that when new knowledge emerges, new scientific insights, they can never ever be peer-reviewed.
[00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:13.601]  So we're blocking all new advances in science, that are big advances.
[00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.063]  If you look at the breakthroughs in science,
[00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:20.765]  Almost always, they don't come from the center of that profession.
[00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:23.306]  They come from the fringe.
[00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:28.287]  The finest candle makers in the world couldn't even think of electric lights.
[00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:29.527]  They don't come from within.
[00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:32.688]  They often come from outside the brakes.
[00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:37.929]  We're going to kill ourselves because of stupidity.
[00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:42.051]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's May 30th on this live Sunday edition.
[00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:43.151]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:43.591]  Please,
[00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:54.625]  Stay with us for the next two hours and beyond because we are going to break incredibly important news exclusively here that could affect the future of the planet in a great way.
[00:04:54.625 --> 00:05:00.830]  And folks, no, that's not pretentious, that's a fact.
[00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:13.621]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:13.881]  history.
[00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:19.179]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.939]  America is under globalist takeover.
[00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.120]  It's an information war.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.200]  It is an economic war.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.761]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:33.123]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[00:05:33.123 --> 00:05:35.604]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:38.305]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.245]  We were the first to lay out
[00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.811]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.873]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[00:05:46.873 --> 00:05:50.995]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:55.537]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[00:05:55.537 --> 00:06:00.420]  So, to all the veterans and all the patrons, we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:13.366]  Big Brother.
[00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:15.166]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.047]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:17.047 --> 00:06:18.748]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:20.429]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:27.232]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:28.732]  It's Sunday, May 30th.
[00:06:28.732 --> 00:06:31.293]  The year is 2021.
[00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:39.757]  And, per usual, we will break absolutely critical information, the future of our species on this planet and beyond.
[00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:46.473]  Thank you again so much for joining us on the eve of Memorial Day.
[00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:47.554]  We're live.
[00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:49.235]  I'll be here for the next two hours.
[00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:53.238]  The Owen Schroyer is coming in to do Sunday live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:55.680]  Central as well.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.503]  Okay, obviously a lot of people are paying attention to this transmission.
[00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:05.707]  I have had so many national talk show hosts and others, folks involved
[00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:20.973]  Former directors of intelligence agencies, not just General Flynn, but others, calling me up congratulating me in the last 48 hours saying, how did you know that it came out of the Wuhan lab?
[00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:31.217]  And the key to victory here is not taking credit for this, because if I just take credit for that, people think I'm some type of Nostradamus, we're going to lose the whole planet.
[00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:33.318]  It specifically came out in late
[00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:53.776]  January, early February, and then March of 2020, the exact virus combo, the five viruses spliced together, six insertions on the CRISPR scanner systems, and in other gene editing and gene reading systems.
[00:07:55.237 --> 00:08:05.904]  Exactly what it was, and then we went and looked up that Fauci had run the entire program there since 2015 when it was deemed illegal in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:12.347]  And so we had on a lot of virologists and epidemiologists and scientists and the guy that wrote the U.S.
[00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:13.008]  Biological
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:24.804]  Weapons law back in the late 80s, and helped write world treaties on biological chemical weapons in the 90s, and was the chief UN war crimes prosecutor of Solomon Milosevic.
[00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:28.965]  I mean, the list goes on and on, and he came on and went over all that data.
[00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:35.307]  He's a professor in Chicago, and laid out exactly what the facts were.
[00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:40.869]  So, it's the equivalent of if they would have had film shot 35 millimeter
[00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:47.055]  of Charlie Manchin telling his cult to go kill Sharon Tate.
[00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:57.340]  It was enough that, you know, have witnesses that he said do it, and he got convicted ultimately, but this would be like having 35 millimeter film of him giving the order.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.821]  And so it's all there.
[00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:09.945]  And so we put all this out over a year ago, 15 months ago, 16 months ago, 17 months ago, hard to believe time's flying,
[00:09:10.848 --> 00:09:25.174]  However many months go back from the end of May 2021 to late January 2020, and there it all is!
[00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:26.234]  And the same thing happens.
[00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:30.116]  These smart people call me and they go, well, congratulations on this.
[00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:31.176]  You've really been proven right again.
[00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:32.557]  I say, listen, it's not me.
[00:09:32.557 --> 00:09:36.058]  Let me send you some articles from the scientists that said, oh, come on, Alex.
[00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:37.039]  Nobody knew but you.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.684]  Then I start trying to tell them what's coming next, and as usual, no one's listening.
[00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:49.230]  Or no one's paying attention like they should be, because it's all right here.
[00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.613]  But even more importantly, why it's all coming out is here.
[00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:55.655]  Don't you want to know why CNN's done a U-turn?
[00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:56.656]  A 180?
[00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:56.977]  A bat-turn?
[00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:03.091]  And come out and said, OK, looks like it came out of the lab.
[00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:03.892]  Here's a headline.
[00:10:03.892 --> 00:10:08.134]  We need to know how COVID-19 emerged so we can stop it from happening.
[00:10:08.134 --> 00:10:11.976]  And ABC News saying, well, looks like it came out of the lab.
[00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:15.258]  They knew 16 months ago.
[00:10:15.258 --> 00:10:22.001]  17 months ago, they knew all this same stuff.
[00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:24.683]  In fact, it was the WHO and Fauci
[00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:33.060]  That went and threatened Australia, and threatened India, and threatened French scientists, because you don't think all our scientists do this too?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.163]  That have these multi-billion dollar machines?
[00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:38.524]  And they threaten their funding!
[00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:54.417]  Because you see, multinational corporations, they quote, donate these machines to these big scientific institutions so they can control what information comes out about the genetic code of humans and everything else on this planet and what they're doing.
[00:10:55.183 --> 00:11:03.226]  And so, scientists got samples, they scanned it, they said this is the Frankenstein of Frankensteins.
[00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:05.326]  Whether it's super deadly or not, that's up for debate.
[00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:10.748]  The fact is, it was five different species of virus welded together.
[00:11:10.748 --> 00:11:21.232]  Now, top US and British scientists, or at the top of the food chain, they're saying six viruses.
[00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:21.392]  So,
[00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:30.083]  It's all there, the pea shuttle genes, all of it, where they actually physically put these viruses together.
[00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:33.605]  And Wuhan was an industrial level site.
[00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:50.079]  We've got video coming up of the Wuhan scientists just covered in blood, head to toe, and just dead animals and stuff everywhere, because they were feeding pigs with the flesh, the organs of pigs that had died from the virus,
[00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:56.840]  So that they could industrially get tons of the virus out for bioweapons.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.161]  The only reason you do that are reportedly thousands of pigs.
[00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:06.122]  Because still the machine they use is a human body or an animal body.
[00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.843]  They're not really making these in labs.
[00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:09.943]  They're just mass producing it.
[00:12:09.943 --> 00:12:11.703]  They isolate it.
[00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:13.624]  Then they put it back into an animal.
[00:12:13.624 --> 00:12:18.625]  And then they start mass producing that particular replication of the virus.
[00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:19.425]  Then they freeze it.
[00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:24.728]  Because most viruses that have become deadly quickly become non-deadly.
[00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:27.870]  They mutate and are no longer a deadly strain.
[00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:34.374]  That's the big secret about germs and about how they go into us and then our body learns how to deal with them and then you get hurt.
[00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:35.395]  And that's all the science.
[00:12:35.395 --> 00:12:45.841]  But today, starting next segment, I am going to, in a very focused way, go through how all this comes together.
[00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:50.120]  And how big a deal it is that this is now actually coming out.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.340]  But here's some of the headlines.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.621]  We need to know how COVID-19 emerged so we can stop it happening again.
[00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:55.561]  Well, I thought we knew.
[00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:57.922]  It was the wet market.
[00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.242]  Somebody ate a bat.
[00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:03.303]  ABC's John Carl admits Trump right about COVID origins.
[00:13:03.303 --> 00:13:08.324]  Some things may be true even if Donald Trump said them.
[00:13:08.324 --> 00:13:12.165]  Virologist says genetic fingerprints prove COVID-19 man-made.
[00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:13.685]  No credible ancestor.
[00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:20.661]  That's in the Daily Mail with these top scientists over in the UK, but that's not really the headline.
[00:13:20.661 --> 00:13:28.004]  The big news is that there's six inserts created through gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute in the virus.
[00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:32.545]  So a bunch of different species of virus didn't naturally mutate into this.
[00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:38.728]  A lizard doesn't mutate in a million years into a giraffe.
[00:13:38.728 --> 00:13:43.910]  I mean, it's whole different viruses, different species of virus,
[00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:51.934]  From the wild, fused into one in a laboratory.
[00:13:51.934 --> 00:14:01.666]  And as Rand Paul, being a doctor, went over the medical system of this, they used natural animals to gestate it in, to basically produce it in,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:11.786]  So that it would then not have all the markings of being made in the lab, but it was spliced in the lab, then put into animals to be produced in their blood, and then strained out.
[00:14:11.786 --> 00:14:18.290]  That's why it was like a slaughterhouse, because it was just massive amounts of these viruses that they were purifying out and preparing.
[00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:25.847]  For the bio-attack they then launched, but humans are so strong and so healthy it didn't work on most people.
[00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:33.152]  Only the old, only the sick, and the Chinese and Wuhan, the most toxic city in the world, who already have destroyed lungs from the toxic air.
[00:14:33.152 --> 00:14:38.636]  A lot of them did die, and so then that was used to create massive hype and massive fear.
[00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:44.300]  But it's all the timing of the release that is the most important.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.702]  Yeah, just click the first link right there where it says Daily Mail.
[00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:47.482]  Show folks that article.
[00:14:47.482 --> 00:14:48.523]  Thanks for TV viewers.
[00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:50.444]  I'm directing the crew here.
[00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:53.085]  There it is.
[00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:58.067]  So, we're going to lay it all out today, and why it's coming out now.
[00:14:58.067 --> 00:15:03.649]  But the big issue here is, it didn't leak from the lab accidentally.
[00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:04.709]  Look at the timing of it.
[00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:11.727]  Look at Fauci saying Trump will be challenged in the next few years by a massive pandemic when he first got into office.
[00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:14.647]  He gave that speech when Trump first got in.
[00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:17.988]  You look at how we stayed locked down but China didn't.
[00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:24.030]  Then China bragged that they've won the economic war and America's over because we stayed locked down and they didn't.
[00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.791]  I mean, they had the motive, they had the background, they had the history, they bragged about it.
[00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:32.147]  Fauci has said China's incredible.
[00:15:32.147 --> 00:15:34.629]  Gates has said China's incredible and America's done.
[00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:35.989]  Big Tech's moved to China.
[00:15:35.989 --> 00:15:49.196]  This was an economic warfare weapon using a virus scare to take over and they wanted it to be a chimera virus so when scientists looked at it they would get really scared and believe the story that it was a super deadly bioweapon.
[00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:50.977]  But that's only part one of it.
[00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:55.839]  It's a carrier virus for any new bioweapon system they want to release.
[00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.621]  I believe they're going to release a later COVID that will be super deadly.
[00:15:58.621 --> 00:15:58.981]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.864 --> 00:16:04.346]  I share with you, the viewers and listeners, the facts of where InfoWars is.
[00:16:04.346 --> 00:16:11.030]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you, because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:21.276]  So in short, the world's awakening, despite all the censorship, InfoWars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the globalist agenda and fighting it.
[00:16:21.276 --> 00:16:21.976]  But that said,
[00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:26.693]  The COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains, has almost shut us down.
[00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:32.756]  Because most of the best-selling products, which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:33.777]  Well, guess what?
[00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:37.419]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:40.360]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.223]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:47.624]  And Alpha Power's back in stock.
[00:16:48.004 --> 00:16:49.225]  I always shoot you straight.
[00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:54.149]  And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:12.970]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.132]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[00:17:15.132 --> 00:17:17.233]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:18.014]  It's okay.
[00:17:18.014 --> 00:17:20.396]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:22.457]  We're having a great effect.
[00:17:22.457 --> 00:17:23.598]  We're exposing evil.
[00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:24.819]  You're exposing evil.
[00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:33.525]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[00:17:33.525 --> 00:17:33.966]  So again,
[00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:41.753]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War.
[00:17:41.753 --> 00:17:55.305]  And I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the Armed Forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.747]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[00:17:56.747 --> 00:17:59.009]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[00:18:00.365 --> 00:18:07.468]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials, and right now we've got store-wide free shipping.
[00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:09.889]  We've got double Patriot points.
[00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:13.751]  We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven months.
[00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:19.473]  We've got 50% off on Ultra 12, 50% off on Vazdo beads, 50% off on Alpha Power.
[00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:20.634]  These are all incredible products.
[00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.575]  I could talk about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you have already
[00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:24.876]  Some of you have used them, some of you haven't.
[00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:25.917]  You've got to go check these out.
[00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:35.426]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas, some of them clones of best-sellers, others original formulations that we came up with, with top developers to blow people away.
[00:18:35.426 --> 00:18:36.126]  And it's all there.
[00:18:36.126 --> 00:18:44.073]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales and specials to mention them all here today.
[00:18:44.073 --> 00:18:49.038]  But whatever you do, go to InfoWorksShore.com, where there's free shipping and double-Patreon points.
[00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:54.203]  I've been on air 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[00:19:07.429 --> 00:19:11.012]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:18.880]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.583]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:28.949]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.354]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[00:19:33.354 --> 00:19:36.138]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[00:19:36.138 --> 00:19:40.724]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[00:19:40.724 --> 00:19:43.869]  And so Infowars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:46.893]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:49.254]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:50.475]  It's so expensive.
[00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:55.777]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:55.777 --> 00:20:03.862]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have throw-in free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:06.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:27.023 --> 00:20:29.143]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:29.143 --> 00:20:34.364]  Because there is a war on over your mind.
[00:20:34.364 --> 00:20:36.185]  And that there certainly is.
[00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:37.725]  Okay.
[00:20:37.725 --> 00:20:42.506]  If you want next year's news today, you're about to get it.
[00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:46.307]  And I don't bring you this information out of speculation.
[00:20:46.307 --> 00:20:52.868]  I bring it to you from deep research analysis and basically tracking everything that's going on in the world.
[00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.891]  And having a deep understanding of all the different power players that are involved.
[00:20:57.891 --> 00:21:01.253]  So let me give you the bottom line, then I'm going to drill into all of it.
[00:21:01.253 --> 00:21:06.054]  There is a giant AI-run world government corporate system being set up.
[00:21:06.054 --> 00:21:08.255]  Communist China is run by these people.
[00:21:08.255 --> 00:21:09.395]  It's the model.
[00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:14.117]  They want to standardize total tyranny, AI control, global social credit score there.
[00:21:15.823 --> 00:21:31.670]  And then they want to sell that as the idea of living a safe and secure life, so the rest of the world basically adopts the same system, but it won't be run by the Communist Chinese, it'll be run by the globalists that put the Chai Koms in power in 1949, and basically launched them for global takeover in the late 1970s.
[00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:35.808]  But that's admitted by the CFR, all the rest of them.
[00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:36.768]  This is a fact.
[00:21:36.768 --> 00:21:43.831]  That's why Joe Biden has come out in a speech and said, China believes it will own America within 15 years.
[00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:45.011]  That's not what he really said.
[00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:47.892]  The New York Post gets it wrong.
[00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:55.675]  He actually said by 2030 or 2035, but he bumbles around, but they've now released the transcript.
[00:21:55.675 --> 00:22:01.617]  So he says, within nine years to 14 years is the real statement.
[00:22:01.617 --> 00:22:02.057]  Nine to 14 years.
[00:22:04.026 --> 00:22:19.452]  But when he says China, he means the globalists, and he says, we're a democracy, we have so much freedom, that's the problem, you need to do what I say, and I'll be a strong man and I can stop GGP-ing, when he's actually running Biden.
[00:22:19.452 --> 00:22:31.156]  And notice, that statement to Americans sounds like, hey, we better do what Biden says, he's gonna protect us from China, but in China, and in that area of Asia, period, to say,
[00:22:32.188 --> 00:22:40.275]  That they're taking over and that he's a stronger dictator, that is taken by the people as an admission of weakness.
[00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:46.540]  And incredible praise of Xi Jinping, who's got his thumb on Joe Biden and on Hunter.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:53.746]  So this is really rubbing it in, just as bad as when he was only in office two weeks after still in the election and he was on CNN.
[00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:56.148]  Gotta cue that up and play it later if you guys can find it.
[00:22:56.148 --> 00:23:00.172]  They told Anderson Cooper, one of the robber baronaires,
[00:23:01.355 --> 00:23:06.238]  He told him that China is just doing what China's got to do for its interior.
[00:23:06.238 --> 00:23:11.822]  Xi's doing what he has to do to protect China, running those death camps with Uyghurs and taking over Hong Kong.
[00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:13.623]  And we're going to stay out of it.
[00:23:13.623 --> 00:23:20.327]  And then you saw the Chinese military start really cracking down more in Hong Kong and other areas within a day of that being said.
[00:23:20.327 --> 00:23:28.753]  I mean, this is the equivalent of Neville Chamberlain telling Hitler he could go ahead and invade Czechoslovakia.
[00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:38.388]  You are seeing incredible developments happen right now, and it's amazing.
[00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:43.452]  So, there's a global power structure that doesn't want China to get too powerful too quick.
[00:23:43.452 --> 00:23:47.074]  Biden's fully controlled.
[00:23:47.074 --> 00:23:49.836]  Gates is fully controlled.
[00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:52.779]  They are China-philes.
[00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:53.159]  Fauci.
[00:23:54.617 --> 00:23:57.698]  That's why they all say China's good, America's bad, China's the future.
[00:23:57.698 --> 00:23:59.238]  They're all invested in China.
[00:23:59.238 --> 00:24:01.839]  So they're not even American double agents.
[00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.500]  They are total China-phile globalists.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.740]  That's their group.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.601]  Then there's other globalist arms.
[00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:14.443]  Think of this as back to the Roman Senate and the intrigue that was there thousands of years ago, 2,000 years ago.
[00:24:14.443 --> 00:24:17.964]  It's very similar, but in a high-tech format.
[00:24:17.964 --> 00:24:19.484]  In modern format, we have more players.
[00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:32.812]  And so there's another arm that doesn't like the fact that the global has tried to push too fast and tried to have China win the global domination fight now, when that's not supposed to happen down the road.
[00:24:32.812 --> 00:24:37.656]  All nations are supposed to lose, and then a global corporate system is meant to dominate them in the end.
[00:24:39.577 --> 00:24:54.464]  The fact that China did purposely leak this with Fauci and with Gates as their economic weapon, along with Klaus Schwab, which they basically admitted they've done, and China brags that they've won the war in a bio-attack, that their response was better than ours.
[00:24:54.464 --> 00:24:58.105]  I mean, they've all but said it.
[00:24:58.105 --> 00:25:06.589]  There are other groups that have the proof, have the whistleblowers, have the scans of the viruses, that they had 16 months ago,
[00:25:07.957 --> 00:25:16.726]  But they wanted to have the lockdown and learn to work from home and teach the public, live under martial law and push medical IDs and push vaccine passports.
[00:25:16.726 --> 00:25:22.532]  They wanted to get all that going worldwide and get everybody used to a QR code and have the banks in control.
[00:25:22.532 --> 00:25:27.518]  But they don't want Bill Gates and Fauci and Xi Jinping to look too big for their britches.
[00:25:28.835 --> 00:25:42.992]  And so now all this is allowed to come out and say, we're going to say it's a leak, and we're going to release the fact that it was done on purpose, if you don't start singing to the same sheet of music as us.
[00:25:42.992 --> 00:25:47.818]  Remember, the globalists built up China, they put them in charge, gave them all our jobs, one-sided trade policies.
[00:25:48.877 --> 00:25:53.120]  For 30 years, China wasn't supposed to go outside the South China Sea.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:26:00.005]  China was supposed to have all the economic development, but NATO was supposed to be the new military superpower, with the U.S.
[00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:03.147]  subservient to it in the future, with the U.N.
[00:26:03.147 --> 00:26:04.668]  and NATO in charge.
[00:26:04.668 --> 00:26:10.412]  But China, of course, double and triple agent and bought up a bunch of the globalist and U.N.
[00:26:10.412 --> 00:26:11.132]  operatives.
[00:26:11.132 --> 00:26:18.117]  That's why even the Times of London admits, the Financial Times admits, that globalism is failing because they all keep infighting.
[00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:28.460]  And so when Biden says, oh, you need to let me be more dictatorial in our democracy, we're trying to democracy to counter China.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:37.363]  He's again trying to trick people to go under autocratic, technocrat speak, so that quote, will be prosperous.
[00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:48.447]  Same thing that Trudeau said to a group of women a few years ago, the leader of the Canadians, Justin Trudeau said, I admire the dictatorship of China.
[00:26:48.447 --> 00:26:50.628]  I think it's the best political system in the world.
[00:26:51.678 --> 00:26:54.179]  Basic dictatorship is what he called it.
[00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:58.340]  He said, we need that to be able to make quick decisions.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:04.801]  So we're being told autocratic, centralized control is the best if you want a bunch of goodies.
[00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:15.684]  And the women got quite excited hearing about the aspiring dictator that they were in the room with and became physically aroused, some of them wiggling around in their seats.
[00:27:15.684 --> 00:27:18.964]  It was very, very bad boyish.
[00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:21.125]  Well, that's because his father served under
[00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:27.586]  The tutelage of one of the Chinese Communist Dictators and received heavy funding from the Communist Chinese.
[00:27:27.586 --> 00:27:29.187]  That's actually on record.
[00:27:29.187 --> 00:27:31.489]  And so he's basically a China-phile as well.
[00:27:31.489 --> 00:27:33.770]  Trudeau's a China-phile.
[00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.713]  The Carnegie Endowment's a China-phile now.
[00:27:36.713 --> 00:27:39.114]  And the CIA Director's a China-phile.
[00:27:39.114 --> 00:27:42.737]  And so they are all kind of like Americans.
[00:27:42.737 --> 00:27:46.020]  A lot of them were pro-Nazi until World War II started.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.681]  And they thought Hitler was going to win.
[00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:51.384]  And then of course they all got set up and put in prison or killed.
[00:27:52.199 --> 00:27:53.380]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:00.526]  There's a sophisticated setup going on that will just basically destroy the US, China, in the end.
[00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:20.062]  And Russia knows that, and they don't want to play any part of this world government AI takeover that wants to collapse all society, all civilization, all human systems, and then leave on its ashes a robot-controlled global police state with only a few megacities that are above the law and their own jurisdictions.
[00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:24.348]  That's what the Vatican is, that's what Israel is, that's what the City of London is.
[00:28:24.348 --> 00:28:35.678]  That's the model where you'll have high-tech cities, city-states, and then no more nation-states, and then the city-states will control all trade and systems worldwide, the rest of us basically starving.
[00:28:36.398 --> 00:28:38.319]  Uh, in a collapsed civilization.
[00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:40.220]  You go, wait, that's like the Hunger Games.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.881]  Well, see, the UN's not copying the Hunger Games.
[00:28:42.881 --> 00:28:45.922]  People read what the UN was planning in their post-industrial world.
[00:28:45.922 --> 00:28:49.784]  It's actually UN world law, and it is the Hunger Games.
[00:28:49.784 --> 00:28:55.787]  And each country, what's left of it, will have one district that's wealthy, everyone else will be slaves, under agenda 2030.
[00:28:55.787 --> 00:28:58.688]  We'll be back with the rest of the story on the other side.
[00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:08.464]  Memorial Day 2021 is here and that means store-wide free shipping and double patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:08.464 --> 00:29:16.947]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:23.569]  And that's a good thing because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:28.293]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[00:29:28.293 --> 00:29:31.136]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:33.098]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:35.020]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.141]  The list goes on and on.
[00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:41.726]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:43.388]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[00:29:43.388 --> 00:29:44.989]  What else is back in stock?
[00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:46.731]  People are very excited to hear.
[00:29:46.731 --> 00:29:47.952]  Pollen Block for
[00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:48.493]  It's back in stock.
[00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:04.353]  I'm not going to say this five times in a row to be obnoxious.
[00:30:04.353 --> 00:30:07.575]  I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals.
[00:30:07.575 --> 00:30:21.442]  Last week, the arch-globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have taken the so-called COVID-19 Franken-shot.
[00:30:21.442 --> 00:30:23.023]  I'm going to say it the second time.
[00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:31.766]  Around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refuse to take the frankenshots.
[00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:33.326]  They don't trust it.
[00:30:33.326 --> 00:30:34.667]  You shouldn't trust it.
[00:30:34.667 --> 00:30:37.368]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world.
[00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:40.549]  This is an attack on the American people and the people of the world.
[00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:44.370]  This is an absolute red flag smoking gun.
[00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.611]  Again, let me say it two more times.
[00:30:46.718 --> 00:30:52.523]  Around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC, the medical staff, refuse to take the vaccines.
[00:30:52.523 --> 00:30:52.943]  That's right.
[00:30:52.943 --> 00:30:56.887]  The doctors, nurses, and scientists do not trust the so-called vaccines.
[00:30:56.887 --> 00:30:58.068]  And you should neither.
[00:30:58.068 --> 00:31:00.290]  You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:13.101]  A lot of virtue signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[00:31:13.101 --> 00:31:13.361]  history.
[00:31:14.042 --> 00:31:18.645]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:21.407]  America is under globalist takeover.
[00:31:21.407 --> 00:31:22.608]  It's an information war.
[00:31:22.608 --> 00:31:23.669]  It is an economic war.
[00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:27.231]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[00:31:27.231 --> 00:31:32.595]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[00:31:32.595 --> 00:31:34.976]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:37.738]  We were the first to tell you the vaccine passports were coming.
[00:31:37.738 --> 00:31:38.719]  We were the first to lay out
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:43.283]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[00:31:43.283 --> 00:31:46.345]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever.
[00:31:46.345 --> 00:31:50.447]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double pay for your points.
[00:31:50.447 --> 00:31:55.010]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.592]  So, to all the veterans and all the patrons, we salute you.
[00:31:57.592 --> 00:32:00.314]  And I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:03.296]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:06.558]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[00:32:07.683 --> 00:32:15.747]  Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bioweapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:22.831]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet President Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000 fines for trying to make people wear masks.
[00:32:22.831 --> 00:32:29.374]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war?
[00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.734]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:36.036]  We are running, right now, the Memorial Day Special for the next week only.
[00:32:36.036 --> 00:32:43.038]  With store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, and DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[00:32:43.038 --> 00:32:45.538]  Sold out for seven months, 40% off.
[00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:48.079]  Supermoto Vitality, 50% off.
[00:32:48.079 --> 00:32:49.599]  Prostagard, 40% off.
[00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:58.702]  Alpha Power, 50%, Ultra 12, 50%, Fazlovi, 50%, free shipping, and Patriot Points, and Enthusiam4, and its incredible products, and George Soros hates it!
[00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:19.714]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.714 --> 00:33:22.135]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.135 --> 00:33:26.456]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.456 --> 00:33:27.917]  Alright, so.
[00:33:27.917 --> 00:33:30.838]  Let me show you these headlines in time all together like I said I would do.
[00:33:32.461 --> 00:33:33.842]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.842 --> 00:33:38.344]  Biden says China believes it will own America within 15 years.
[00:33:38.344 --> 00:33:40.045]  That's not what he really said.
[00:33:40.045 --> 00:33:44.727]  He said by 2030 or 2035, which is 9 to 14 years.
[00:33:44.727 --> 00:33:52.711]  And I agree with that statement, but he means China would have been used by the globalists to economically, militarily break our back.
[00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:53.951]  Then that ties in with this.
[00:33:53.951 --> 00:34:02.035]  China establishes company to build satellites, broadband, mega constellation of thousands of satellites.
[00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:08.654]  Which can also then be hunter-killer satellites and take out western satellites.
[00:34:08.654 --> 00:34:10.656]  That's about dominance.
[00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:14.619]  And then that ties into this incredibly important stack.
[00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:17.201]  Genetically modified salmon heads to U.S.
[00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:19.162]  dinner plates.
[00:34:19.162 --> 00:34:23.806]  It's got insect genes, it's got plant genes in it, it's not even really a salmon.
[00:34:23.806 --> 00:34:25.727]  It eats the other salmon.
[00:34:25.727 --> 00:34:26.868]  But that's okay.
[00:34:26.868 --> 00:34:29.550]  They're all wearing their mask in the photo.
[00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:36.546]  Humans are dirty, but GMO salmon released into the wild, they're good.
[00:34:36.546 --> 00:34:43.451]  Dems vote to allow scientists to create animal-human hybrids in disturbing move.
[00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:45.332]  I first reported that back in the week.
[00:34:45.332 --> 00:34:46.273]  People didn't believe it.
[00:34:46.273 --> 00:34:49.034]  A few days later, folks went and watched C-SPAN.
[00:34:49.034 --> 00:34:51.676]  They were trying to pass a bill to ban it.
[00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:53.698]  The Democrats said, no, it's legal.
[00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:55.619]  Create human-animal hybrids.
[00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:02.193]  And that leads us to this next point before I go back to the big picture.
[00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:10.136]  If you go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, you can see the headline for the live feed of the show today.
[00:35:10.136 --> 00:35:14.217]  It always focuses in on one of the central big points.
[00:35:14.217 --> 00:35:16.518]  And there it is, Sunday Live.
[00:35:16.518 --> 00:35:26.302]  Biden's EEOC, you know, the guys that fight racism for humanity, says forced injections are legal.
[00:35:26.302 --> 00:35:27.322]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:35.385]  Companies can make employees take COVID-19 vaccine, EEOC says.
[00:35:35.385 --> 00:35:46.812]  And saying if you can't have your job, if somebody can't put a GMO experimental secret potion into you, that's forced.
[00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:49.954]  Saying we'll take your job if you don't do it, that's forced.
[00:35:49.954 --> 00:35:56.298]  Terrorism is the threat of violence or actual violence to get a
[00:35:57.139 --> 00:36:01.002]  Political or economic concession.
[00:36:01.002 --> 00:36:10.169]  And to say, I'm going to take all your money away, I'm going to put you on the street, if you don't do what I say, if you don't take our inoculations.
[00:36:10.169 --> 00:36:20.817]  You know, the UN 50 years ago said, we're going to have a universal guaranteed income, we're going to control everybody and make people get sterilized, so they even get their dole.
[00:36:20.817 --> 00:36:22.518]  And you can argue, well, there are too many people.
[00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:23.999]  You don't want the UN running that.
[00:36:23.999 --> 00:36:25.701]  My God, these are murderers.
[00:36:27.432 --> 00:36:30.414]  So that's what this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:30.414 --> 00:36:35.076]  And remember, oh, the left said nobody's going to make you have a vaccine passport.
[00:36:35.076 --> 00:36:37.017]  Nobody's going to make you have a job.
[00:36:37.017 --> 00:36:39.238]  That's preposterous.
[00:36:39.238 --> 00:36:40.699]  But now it's here.
[00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:43.101]  Oh, oh, and they said there's new variants.
[00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:44.381]  Sorry, the old shots didn't work.
[00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:46.162]  You got to take more.
[00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:49.424]  And the deaths are mounting and mounting and mounting.
[00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:54.367]  Universal basic income is the answer to the inequalities exposed by COVID-19.
[00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:54.947]  That's right.
[00:36:54.947 --> 00:36:56.708]  Big tech and big media.
[00:36:57.378 --> 00:37:00.839]  And big governments say, your small business is not essential.
[00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:03.780]  So after a few months of lockdown, you've got to go get on welfare.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:11.262]  And, oh, we need more welfare because there's inequity by the very people that are setting it all up.
[00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.963]  So what do you get from these headlines?
[00:37:13.963 --> 00:37:16.664]  Genetically modified salmon head to U.S.
[00:37:16.664 --> 00:37:18.184]  dinner plates.
[00:37:18.184 --> 00:37:19.925]  And that image right there says it all.
[00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:28.779]  Why, here's the scientist showing you their frankenfish that's twice as big and grows almost twice as fast but does attack and kill the other salmon.
[00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:32.561]  And it's part insect and it's part plant, but that's okay.
[00:37:32.561 --> 00:37:34.162]  Who knows what it'll do when you eat it?
[00:37:34.162 --> 00:37:39.404]  Who knows what viruses it'll shed when you splice organisms?
[00:37:39.404 --> 00:37:43.446]  But don't worry, the dirty humans are wearing their mask while they introduce this life form.
[00:37:45.302 --> 00:37:50.744]  Continuing, Dems vote to allow scientists to create animal-human hybrids in disturbing move.
[00:37:50.744 --> 00:37:53.024]  Westernjournal.com.
[00:37:53.024 --> 00:37:53.945]  In disturbing move.
[00:37:53.945 --> 00:37:55.825]  I think that says it lightly.
[00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:58.586]  This is a revolution against basic common sense.
[00:37:58.586 --> 00:38:00.927]  A revolution against our bodies.
[00:38:00.927 --> 00:38:05.288]  A revolution against our privacy.
[00:38:05.288 --> 00:38:10.370]  Companies can make employees take COVID-19 vaccine, EEOC says.
[00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.610]  So,
[00:38:12.449 --> 00:38:16.610]  If you don't hire enough people the right color, this federal agency comes after you.
[00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:34.853]  But, if you don't want to put some secret concoction from multinational corporations that's been banned in hundreds of countries in your body, and your job discriminates against your religious, or your economic, or just your conscientious objection, you don't trust the big pharma?
[00:38:34.853 --> 00:38:39.074]  Never before could they do this, but now the EEOC says so.
[00:38:39.074 --> 00:38:41.194]  They're legalizing animal-human cloning.
[00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:41.714]  They just did it.
[00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:45.981]  That's light years, you see, of what you thought they'd do.
[00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:48.683]  What have I told you probably a thousand times in the last ten years?
[00:38:48.683 --> 00:38:53.907]  You'll wake up one day and they'll announce, human clones are legal, animal human clones are legal.
[00:38:53.907 --> 00:38:59.091]  I've said that a thousand times in the last five years, conservatively.
[00:38:59.091 --> 00:39:03.975]  And you woke up last week, and the Senate said it's legal.
[00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:10.580]  Because it's already been done, they tried to pass a law to stop it, and they fell ten votes short.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.401]  It's going on.
[00:39:13.306 --> 00:39:17.068]  It's been going on for 50 years, but now they're ready to roll it out.
[00:39:17.068 --> 00:39:18.468]  Now they think they've perfected it.
[00:39:18.468 --> 00:39:22.090]  So they're like, yeah, we're gonna put stuff in your body, you're fired.
[00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.071]  We're gonna put stuff in your body, you can't leave your house.
[00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.452]  We're gonna put stuff in your body, or you can't get on a bus or a train.
[00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:30.794]  We're gonna track everywhere you go, and you're non-essential.
[00:39:30.794 --> 00:39:34.055]  We're gonna create salmon that aren't even really salmon.
[00:39:34.055 --> 00:39:36.816]  And notice, all the world, the same announcement got made the same day.
[00:39:36.816 --> 00:39:40.338]  That's the U.S., here's the U.K.
[00:39:40.338 --> 00:39:40.458]  U.K.
[00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:45.392]  Minister, UK could make COVID-19 jabs compulsory in healthcare.
[00:39:45.392 --> 00:39:48.294]  Minister says, always more, more, more.
[00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:49.455]  Told you that was coming.
[00:39:49.455 --> 00:39:55.639]  And next it'll be in your job, in your area.
[00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:59.281]  So now you understand what's going on.
[00:39:59.281 --> 00:40:00.662]  This is a revolution.
[00:40:00.662 --> 00:40:02.724]  China's been creating animal-human clones.
[00:40:02.724 --> 00:40:05.706]  They've been creating all sorts of other animal and animal clones.
[00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:09.048]  They've been creating these splices like this salmon.
[00:40:09.048 --> 00:40:10.929]  There's a bunch of varieties of GMO salmon.
[00:40:12.856 --> 00:40:28.369]  And they would never approve in the last few decades because every time they test them in tanks, they kill the other wildlife and other fish and act totally psychotic and then have all sorts of mutations and have all sorts of weird deformed babies and just God knows what it's going to do.
[00:40:28.369 --> 00:40:31.812]  But now they just said, you know what, we're doing it.
[00:40:31.812 --> 00:40:33.994]  The bottom fell out.
[00:40:33.994 --> 00:40:39.959]  Human animal clonings, animal clone clones, splices, chimeras, and then Joe Biden
[00:40:42.085 --> 00:40:43.466]  He's on the news telling you.
[00:40:43.466 --> 00:40:54.435]  Well hell, instead of just me sandwiching on the news saying, let's go ahead and play a clip of Joe Biden explaining how China's going to win because Xi Jinping's a dictator.
[00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:56.417]  Here it is.
[00:40:56.417 --> 00:41:04.023]  We're in a battle between democracies and autocracies.
[00:41:04.023 --> 00:41:08.887]  The more complicated the world becomes, the more difficult it is for democracies to come together and reach consensus.
[00:41:11.738 --> 00:41:18.500]  I've spent more time with President Xi of China than any world leader has.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.221]  For 24 hours of private meetings with him.
[00:41:22.221 --> 00:41:24.542]  He's just an interpreter.
[00:41:24.542 --> 00:41:28.063]  17,000 miles traveling between China and here.
[00:41:28.063 --> 00:41:36.605]  He firmly believes that China before the year 3035 is going to own America.
[00:41:36.605 --> 00:41:39.766]  Because autocracies can make quick decisions.
[00:41:42.768 --> 00:41:49.155]  And what he's saying is dictatorship can make quick decisions just like Trudeau said when that's not true.
[00:41:49.155 --> 00:42:03.270]  I've got a bunch of financial analysis here that's excellent we'll cover when we come back about the fact that all the rigging of the markets is what's creating all the disparities and all the problems and all the instability and they're doing it because they control the instability and it's beyond
[00:42:04.728 --> 00:42:15.677]  Insider trading, it's manipulating the markets to make the general public poor and the establishment have all the money and currency so they can dictate to us the terms of our surrender.
[00:42:15.677 --> 00:42:18.659]  This is economic war.
[00:42:18.659 --> 00:42:30.488]  And everything Biden does, shutting off our pipelines, raising the gas prices, bankrupting the border, calling for people that don't add anything to the U.S., pregnant women with children, to come here to weigh down the system,
[00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:41.940]  Attacking our military, creating all this racism, promoting riots, promoting pedophilia, all of it should demoralize us and bring us down.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.940]  He's shutting down U.S.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.601]  pipelines and authorizing Russian pipelines.
[00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:47.281]  It's war!
[00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:48.141]  Figure it out!
[00:42:48.141 --> 00:42:51.042]  He's a globalist, chi-com agent.
[00:42:51.042 --> 00:42:52.343]  They stole the election.
[00:42:52.343 --> 00:42:55.663]  They put him in there to destroy the country.
[00:42:55.663 --> 00:42:59.985]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:01.125]  I always shoot you straight.
[00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:05.971]  And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:13.118]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[00:43:13.118 --> 00:43:15.299]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:17.379]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[00:43:17.379 --> 00:43:18.180]  It's okay.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.541]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:22.601]  We're having a great effect.
[00:43:22.601 --> 00:43:23.742]  We're exposing evil.
[00:43:23.742 --> 00:43:24.982]  You're exposing evil.
[00:43:24.982 --> 00:43:33.665]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[00:43:33.665 --> 00:43:34.125]  So again,
[00:43:34.805 --> 00:43:55.473]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[00:43:55.473 --> 00:43:56.934]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:59.675]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[00:43:59.675 --> 00:44:01.556]  I share with you, the viewers and listeners,
[00:44:02.436 --> 00:44:10.841]  The facts of where InfoWars is, and it's always a complex picture, but I'll do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[00:44:10.841 --> 00:44:21.067]  So in short, the world's awakening, despite all the censorship, InfoWars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the globalist agenda and fighting it.
[00:44:21.067 --> 00:44:21.768]  But that said,
[00:44:22.546 --> 00:44:26.509]  The COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains, has almost shut us down.
[00:44:26.509 --> 00:44:32.552]  Because most of the best-selling products, which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[00:44:32.552 --> 00:44:33.573]  Well, guess what?
[00:44:33.573 --> 00:44:37.215]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[00:44:37.215 --> 00:44:40.157]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:40.157 --> 00:44:46.021]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:47.422]  And Alpha Power's back in stock.
[00:44:47.762 --> 00:44:49.143]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, InfoWarriors!
[00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:11.805]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you how amazing Pollen Block is, but you should go to InfoWarsTore.com and read the third-party review sites that we have links to where it's got five stars and people love it.
[00:45:11.805 --> 00:45:20.295]  Pollen Block is a proprietary formula from France where they just learned by happenstance that quail that eat a certain diet
[00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:28.961]  Produce eggs and eggshells that are amazing when people eat them for knocking out seasonal discomfort or what folks call allergies.
[00:45:28.961 --> 00:45:30.041]  It's back in stock.
[00:45:30.041 --> 00:45:31.202]  It's been sold out for a long time.
[00:45:31.202 --> 00:45:32.303]  It's very hard to get.
[00:45:32.303 --> 00:45:34.064]  Despite that, it's 40% off.
[00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:38.808]  We have storewide free shipping right now for Memorial Day and Double Patreon points.
[00:45:38.808 --> 00:45:40.589]  So Pollen Block is back in stock.
[00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:41.890]  So is DNA Force.
[00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:43.051]  So are so many other great products.
[00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:45.712]  Storewide free shipping and your purchase funds the InfoWars.
[00:45:45.712 --> 00:45:48.775]  So that is a true 360 win.
[00:45:48.775 --> 00:45:50.476]  Get your Pollen Block today.
[00:45:51.076 --> 00:45:54.961]  I've been on air 27 years and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:11.110]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:18.993]  Because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:22.674]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[00:46:22.674 --> 00:46:32.877]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us, the whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:36.258]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[00:46:36.258 --> 00:46:40.839]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:43.980]  And so, InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.481]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[00:46:47.481 --> 00:46:49.361]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[00:46:49.361 --> 00:46:50.582]  It's so expensive.
[00:46:50.582 --> 00:46:55.883]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:55.883 --> 00:46:59.504]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-1 free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:47:03.462 --> 00:47:06.764]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:06.764 --> 00:47:15.870]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:22.475]  Why would ABC News and CNN and all of them come out and say, okay, maybe it did come out of a lab?
[00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:38.274]  Because they know there's whistleblowers, they know there's scientists, they know that there's insiders who've been exposing this in the last 16, 17 months.
[00:47:38.274 --> 00:47:41.156]  And they know they can't hide it anymore.
[00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:50.621]  And so instead they're going to try to spin it and say it just leaked out of the lab on accident when Fauci and others funded the game of function and lied to Congress.
[00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:53.382]  Fauci needs to be arrested now.
[00:47:53.382 --> 00:47:56.424]  Bill Gates, who funded it and ran it all, needs to be indicted.
[00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:01.631]  Or they're going to continue to launch more of these attacks in the future through the U.N.
[00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:04.072]  and use it as a pretext to have the U.N.
[00:48:04.072 --> 00:48:15.200]  run our speech, to say what doctors can and can't do, to totally control our lives and to give themselves total power and control over the planet.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.981]  It's an Operation Lockstep.
[00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:22.004]  It's an Event 201 with Bill Gates if they would use a virus for their takeover.
[00:48:22.004 --> 00:48:27.528]  And they've all massively increased their wealth, doubling or tripling it, because they're essential and we're not.
[00:48:28.354 --> 00:48:33.198]  And that's the most important point I want to hit here in just a moment.
[00:48:33.198 --> 00:48:38.522]  Because in this article on GMO Salmon, now hitting U.S.
[00:48:38.522 --> 00:48:44.006]  tables, after 20 years of it being blocked, is key.
[00:48:44.006 --> 00:48:50.932]  I'm going to hit it in a moment, but first, since I mentioned it, let's go ahead and go to ABC's John Carl.
[00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:56.120]  Saying, well, I mean, even if Trump said it, he can be right sometimes.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.741]  Oh, like the election being stolen?
[00:48:57.741 --> 00:48:58.062]  Here it is.
[00:48:58.948 --> 00:49:01.109]  And yes, I think a lot of people have egg on their face.
[00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:07.612]  This was an idea that was first put forward by Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, Donald Trump.
[00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:12.754]  And look, some things may be true even if Donald Trump said them.
[00:49:12.754 --> 00:49:17.516]  And there was, because Trump was saying so much else, it was just out of control.
[00:49:17.516 --> 00:49:28.401]  And because he was, you know, making a frankly racist appeal talking about Kung Flu and the China virus, his notion that put forward that this may have
[00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:33.165]  Or no, he said flatly that this came from that lab was widely dismissed.
[00:49:33.165 --> 00:49:35.346]  But actually, there's some real reason.
[00:49:35.346 --> 00:49:36.247]  We don't know, by the way.
[00:49:36.247 --> 00:49:36.988]  We still don't know.
[00:49:36.988 --> 00:49:38.629]  We absolutely don't know.
[00:49:38.629 --> 00:49:43.232]  But now, serious people are saying it needs a serious inquiry.
[00:49:43.232 --> 00:49:49.677]  Okay, well, number one, you call a virus where it came from.
[00:49:49.677 --> 00:49:50.918]  That's why they have these new strains.
[00:49:50.918 --> 00:49:54.421]  They call it the British strain or they call it the Brazilian strain.
[00:49:54.421 --> 00:49:55.722]  Pure bull.
[00:49:55.722 --> 00:49:58.204]  You know, the Spanish flu they thought came out of Spain.
[00:49:58.877 --> 00:49:59.878]  So they call it the Spanish Flu.
[00:49:59.878 --> 00:50:01.278]  It has nothing to do with the people there.
[00:50:01.278 --> 00:50:02.199]  And they know that.
[00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:06.841]  But that's how they try to turn everything into a racial issue instead of the science.
[00:50:06.841 --> 00:50:10.543]  But here's what we know.
[00:50:10.543 --> 00:50:13.284]  They use the fear of the virus to shut down society.
[00:50:13.284 --> 00:50:14.705]  They lied about how deadly it was.
[00:50:14.705 --> 00:50:16.986]  They promoted the fake PCR test.
[00:50:16.986 --> 00:50:21.008]  And anywhere the people don't stand up and demand to be reopened never reopens.
[00:50:21.008 --> 00:50:22.929]  Like Canada.
[00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:25.010]  Or Australia.
[00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:25.691]  Or New Zealand.
[00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:28.472]  Where they let you off lockdown for a few weeks and go right back on it.
[00:50:29.071 --> 00:50:35.196]  Because if you are a service economy person, or you work for a small company, you're non-essential.
[00:50:35.196 --> 00:50:39.740]  Well, in the U.S., we still produce a lot of the world's food and a lot of the world's energy.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:46.626]  So as long as those industries have to have humans doing it, those areas will be somewhat open.
[00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:53.191]  But if you're in an area where you aren't essential to the globalists, you're done.
[00:50:53.191 --> 00:50:57.755]  And of course, that's why we have to, with our energy, only buy and only promote local
[00:50:59.191 --> 00:51:07.073]  And regional, that is small and medium-sized businesses that have a code of being pro-human.
[00:51:07.073 --> 00:51:13.255]  You've heard of fair trade coffee and all this to make sure the villagers get a little bit of money to actually be able to have a decent life.
[00:51:13.255 --> 00:51:14.256]  Absolutely.
[00:51:14.256 --> 00:51:18.637]  That's a great idea, but let's go way further of pro-human trade.
[00:51:20.419 --> 00:51:22.240]  Sustainable doesn't mean get rid of the humans.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.344]  Real sustainability means building a clean, good, healthy Earth that also helps humans be clean and healthy.
[00:51:28.344 --> 00:51:39.071]  The globalists just want to engineer a collapse that they control to massively reduce population and on the ashes of it build a very high-tech technocracy.
[00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:48.858]  And we're showing you footage of Australia where they beat people in Germany, where they beat people with clubs, in Spain with water cannons and dogs for trying to go outside to the park
[00:51:54.767 --> 00:51:56.108]  That's what happens in Australia.
[00:51:56.108 --> 00:51:57.649]  That's what happens in New Zealand.
[00:51:57.649 --> 00:51:59.131]  That's what happens in Germany.
[00:51:59.131 --> 00:52:00.512]  That's what happens in the UK.
[00:52:00.512 --> 00:52:06.376]  And now they're on the news in the UK saying, oh, a million people marched again for opening the economy.
[00:52:06.376 --> 00:52:07.137]  You're dumb!
[00:52:07.137 --> 00:52:08.618]  We're already open!
[00:52:08.618 --> 00:52:10.259]  Oh, at 25% capacity?
[00:52:10.259 --> 00:52:12.081]  Gotta wear a mask?
[00:52:12.081 --> 00:52:14.203]  You gotta show a QR code to get in places?
[00:52:14.203 --> 00:52:15.564]  Oh, they promised that wouldn't happen!
[00:52:15.564 --> 00:52:15.844]  Remember?
[00:52:18.872 --> 00:52:21.773]  Again, they're not creeping up to a takeover anymore.
[00:52:21.773 --> 00:52:22.913]  That was all beta.
[00:52:22.913 --> 00:52:25.173]  Now it's, hey, you're going to eat GMO salmon.
[00:52:25.173 --> 00:52:26.554]  Hey, the borders are wide open.
[00:52:26.554 --> 00:52:27.914]  Hey, we waive the laws.
[00:52:27.914 --> 00:52:29.655]  No background checks on who we give.
[00:52:29.655 --> 00:52:31.955]  One-year-old babies thrown over a wall.
[00:52:31.955 --> 00:52:40.797]  They're just given to some fake Catholic charity and then delivered to known smugglers' hands and then disappear.
[00:52:40.797 --> 00:52:44.438]  Human animal clones legalized last Tuesday by the U.S.
[00:52:44.438 --> 00:52:44.718]  Senate.
[00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:56.682]  And you notice that no law had to be signed because they're already doing it.
[00:52:56.682 --> 00:52:59.227]  They wouldn't pass a law to prohibit it.
[00:52:59.227 --> 00:53:00.690]  Possession is not against the law.
[00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.672]  They're just doing it.
[00:53:02.256 --> 00:53:06.437]  They're just telling your kids to wear a mask and teach them they're non-essential.
[00:53:06.437 --> 00:53:11.699]  They're just having convicted pedophiles dressed like women come in and have your son bounce on their knee at public school.
[00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:13.499]  They're just teaching satanism.
[00:53:13.499 --> 00:53:21.281]  They're just pushing partial birth abortion and keeping the babies alive until they get a list of who wants the organs and get top dollar.
[00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:22.562]  They're doing it all.
[00:53:22.562 --> 00:53:26.503]  It's their satanic, globalist revolution against us.
[00:53:28.328 --> 00:53:35.332]  Where they teach us to not value each other, where they teach us to not be able to have anything labeled like the GMO frankenshots.
[00:53:35.332 --> 00:53:40.436]  They've got legislation where from now on there won't be anything on vaccines or drugs of any type.
[00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:41.536]  There won't be an insert.
[00:53:41.536 --> 00:53:42.997]  There won't be adverse reactions.
[00:53:42.997 --> 00:53:44.618]  They'll just do whatever they want.
[00:53:44.618 --> 00:53:48.261]  Just like 5G and all the studies gives you cancer.
[00:53:48.261 --> 00:53:54.985]  This is an anti-human revolution where they got so many things killing us, no one ever knows exactly what got you.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.382]  Let me show you the key in this article, hidden in this AP article.
[00:53:59.382 --> 00:54:01.724]  Genetically modified salmon head to U.S.
[00:54:01.724 --> 00:54:03.886]  dinner plates.
[00:54:03.886 --> 00:54:06.608]  Oh, it's so nice.
[00:54:06.608 --> 00:54:16.416]  Indianapolis AP, the inaugural harvest of genetically modified salmon begins this week after the pandemic delayed the sale.
[00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:18.037]  You mean the martial law worldwide drill?
[00:54:19.858 --> 00:54:25.001]  Of the first such altered salmon to be cleared for human consumption in the United States.
[00:54:25.001 --> 00:54:30.505]  Trump wouldn't clear it, but don't worry, Biden did.
[00:54:30.505 --> 00:54:40.911]  The CEO of the company said several times of the engineered biotech company Aqua Bounty Technologies Inc.
[00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:45.434]  will now head to restaurants and away from home dining services who are labeling
[00:54:46.568 --> 00:54:49.229]  As genetically engineered is not required.
[00:54:49.229 --> 00:54:56.471]  Oh, the only area where there's not a law that you've got to have it, and they're not going to tell you!
[00:54:56.471 --> 00:54:58.952]  How loving and liberal!
[00:54:58.952 --> 00:55:02.153]  In the Midwest and along the East Coast.
[00:55:02.153 --> 00:55:04.133]  Yeah, they're going to bomb you with this stuff.
[00:55:04.133 --> 00:55:04.934]  Continuing.
[00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:13.236]  Thus far, the only customer to announce it is selling the salmon is Samuels and Sons Seafood, a Philadelphia-based seafood distributor.
[00:55:14.068 --> 00:55:15.369]  Well, here's what you tell people.
[00:55:15.369 --> 00:55:20.093]  You hang a sign up saying, we don't have GMO.
[00:55:20.093 --> 00:55:20.913]  Animals.
[00:55:20.913 --> 00:55:27.438]  And by the way, this thing's got insects in it, it's got plant genes in it, the mutations, the top scientists say this is insane.
[00:55:27.438 --> 00:55:32.062]  Who knows what zoological mutations of viruses you're gonna get out of this.
[00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.904]  I mean, look what you got in the Pfizer shot.
[00:55:33.904 --> 00:55:36.626]  Jellyfish and the entire human genome.
[00:55:36.626 --> 00:55:37.666]  People ask, what's that for?
[00:55:37.666 --> 00:55:41.029]  We're not gonna tell you.
[00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.970]  And the EEOC says,
[00:55:44.127 --> 00:55:46.188]  Your employer can make you take it.
[00:55:46.188 --> 00:55:47.188]  No, they can't.
[00:55:47.188 --> 00:55:56.591]  The EEOC is a Nazi organization that runs around saying it's fighting racism all day because they want us fighting with each other while humans are being annihilated.
[00:55:56.591 --> 00:56:00.613]  But there's the answer to the genetically modified creature.
[00:56:00.613 --> 00:56:02.573]  It's not even a salmon.
[00:56:02.573 --> 00:56:07.715]  It's an insectoid spliced chimera abomination.
[00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.112]  The answer is, refuse it.
[00:56:12.112 --> 00:56:14.314]  The answer is demand labeling laws.
[00:56:14.314 --> 00:56:16.155]  The answer is say no.
[00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:20.619]  But instead, what does the Club of Rome and its offshoot say every day on every channel?
[00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.579]  Klaus Schwab and the Davos Group.
[00:56:23.579 --> 00:56:25.320]  You will eat bugs.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.561]  You will drink sewage.
[00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:27.741]  You will eat weeds.
[00:56:27.741 --> 00:56:28.742]  And you will like it.
[00:56:28.742 --> 00:56:34.665]  And now all these liberal states are legalizing bugs and saying, we're going to put it on school lunch tables.
[00:56:34.665 --> 00:56:35.946]  You're like, they won't do that.
[00:56:35.946 --> 00:56:36.206]  Really?
[00:56:36.206 --> 00:56:38.047]  They send pedophiles into your schools?
[00:56:38.047 --> 00:56:38.928]  Oh, really?
[00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:41.349]  They legalize human animal cloning?
[00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.689]  Oh, really?
[00:56:41.689 --> 00:56:43.250]  Yes, they will!
[00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.092]  Because you won't say no!
[00:56:46.092 --> 00:56:48.253]  And everyone's been preconditioned when we warned them about this.
[00:56:50.197 --> 00:57:01.824]  It's like when we walk into the Austin City Council, it's top scientists, heads of university departments, saying fluoride causes brain damage and lower IQ and just low levels when it's added to water supplies.
[00:57:01.824 --> 00:57:05.426]  And the mayor just laughs and says, I'm going to turn my mic off.
[00:57:05.426 --> 00:57:06.386]  I'm not listening to you.
[00:57:06.386 --> 00:57:08.968]  And the mayor leaves.
[00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:10.089]  They just laugh at you.
[00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:11.890]  You're going to drink sewage.
[00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:13.070]  You're going to eat bugs.
[00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.151]  You're going to eat GMO.
[00:57:14.151 --> 00:57:16.933]  You're going to eat plant, animal, spliced animals.
[00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.533]  And we're going to radiate you with 5G.
[00:57:18.533 --> 00:57:19.294]  And it's just how it is.
[00:57:20.606 --> 00:57:22.787]  No, we as consumers say no!
[00:57:22.787 --> 00:57:24.907]  We'll never shop or buy from anybody again.
[00:57:24.907 --> 00:57:29.548]  And everybody better tell you if they're serving this crap, or we're going to sue your ass.
[00:57:29.548 --> 00:57:34.690]  We've got to get aggressive and say no and stand up for humans and the earth or it's all over.
[00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.450]  That's why I tell you to ban carbon dioxide all day long.
[00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.031]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:57:39.031 --> 00:57:45.653]  So while you're worrying about carbon dioxide, they're frankensteining the entire planet with a genetic alien takeover basically.
[00:57:45.653 --> 00:57:46.953]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:57:50.398 --> 00:57:56.179]  I'm giving you a status report on what your support of InfoWars has done.
[00:57:56.179 --> 00:58:00.260]  We are kicking Globalist's ass up and down the planet right now.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.781]  Their entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines, it's all coming out.
[00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:07.522]  And yes, I'm risking my life, and yes, this is very dangerous.
[00:58:07.522 --> 00:58:11.642]  But it's worth it, and I'm very honored to be in the fight, so thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[00:58:11.642 --> 00:58:14.043]  And our great crew here at InfoWars.
[00:58:14.043 --> 00:58:14.143]  And...
[00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:15.930]  Here's the other good news.
[00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.311]  This has been sold out for seven months.
[00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:21.113]  It's got the highest quality PQ10, CoQ10.
[00:58:21.113 --> 00:58:25.175]  It's so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, your nerves.
[00:58:27.534 --> 00:58:28.595]  Look at the other ingredients.
[00:58:28.595 --> 00:58:29.896]  They all go together.
[00:58:29.896 --> 00:58:37.320]  This incredible formula, our number one bestseller, is now back in stock 40% off at InfoWarscore.com.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.761]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:58:38.761 --> 00:58:39.862]  Back in stock.
[00:58:39.862 --> 00:58:41.383]  InfoWarscore.com.
[00:58:41.383 --> 00:58:44.305]  And it funds the InfoWarscore accrued 360 win.
[00:58:44.305 --> 00:58:47.887]  Get it while you still can at InfoWarscore.com for 40% off.
[00:58:47.887 --> 00:58:48.708]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:58:50.663 --> 00:58:59.287]  Memorial Day 2021 is here, and that means store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points at InfowarStore.com.
[00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:07.772]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[00:59:07.772 --> 00:59:14.695]  And that's a good thing, because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[00:59:14.695 --> 00:59:16.456]  All of them are amazing, but DNA
[00:59:16.516 --> 00:59:16.676]  Yeah.
[00:59:38.899 --> 00:59:40.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.511]  Alright, Chris Skye has been arrested.
[01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:17.053]  He's just a well-spoken activist.
[01:00:17.053 --> 01:00:18.394]  Wanted Canada to be reopened.
[01:00:18.394 --> 01:00:20.976]  He said over a year ago it wouldn't be reopened in a viral video.
[01:00:20.976 --> 01:00:23.097]  It's been proven to be dead on.
[01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:26.540]  And in subsequent videos, he's joining us.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.982]  They sent police to his house when he dared go to the grocery store and interview people about the lockdown.
[01:00:31.658 --> 01:00:36.507]  The level of tyranny you will live under is the exact level you will accept, to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[01:00:37.649 --> 01:00:51.051]  I did not plug any last hour, and if I don't plug, we're not going to be here, because we were in the red the first five months of the year, because a bunch of our best-selling products would not come in because of the COVID fake lockdowns.
[01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:56.112]  Warehouses, supply chains totally broke down, and you're seeing supply chain problems everywhere.
[01:00:56.112 --> 01:01:05.594]  Food prices increase, supplement prices increase, lumber prices, steel prices triple, and this is just the beginning, because now people milk it,
[01:01:06.147 --> 01:01:11.969]  Where if one person gets tested at a company for COVID, even though they're not sick, the whole company just shuts down.
[01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:15.091]  Well, China never shut down.
[01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:20.193]  So they're taking over the planet, and they've doubled and tripled their profits, and we're falling apart.
[01:01:20.193 --> 01:01:26.175]  So we finally got a bunch of the products in, seven months since DNA Force Plus was in.
[01:01:26.175 --> 01:01:33.998]  A whole bunch of times since some of the other products, like Pollen Block, I forget how many months, Seasonal Discomfort Allergy, it's all natural, it's amazing, people love it.
[01:01:35.114 --> 01:01:35.695]  We're good to go.
[01:01:57.774 --> 01:02:06.701]  And double patriot points for the first time this year, and 40% off on DNA Force, 40% off on Bottom Block, 50% off on Ultra 12.
[01:02:06.701 --> 01:02:09.163]  Now you want to talk about natural clean energy.
[01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:10.665]  You can take Turbo Force all day long.
[01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:11.005]  It's great.
[01:02:11.005 --> 01:02:11.465]  It's amazing.
[01:02:11.465 --> 01:02:12.987]  10 hours of clean energy.
[01:02:12.987 --> 01:02:21.313]  But Ultra 12, good vitamin B12 from a good organic source, take it under the tongue, is the platform for your entire body's operation.
[01:02:21.313 --> 01:02:23.075]  And it tastes sweet naturally.
[01:02:23.075 --> 01:02:24.516]  That's what real B12 tastes like.
[01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.151]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[01:02:28.151 --> 01:02:31.654]  So these are all amazing products.
[01:02:31.654 --> 01:02:35.218]  And they're all priced very low for the quality you're getting.
[01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:47.850]  I could buy a crappy type of PQQ or CoQ10 for half the cost, but the studies show it doesn't get absorbed by your cells, it doesn't get into your mitochondria, it doesn't get into your telomeres and have them last longer.
[01:02:49.073 --> 01:02:50.254]  And telomeres are like a candle.
[01:02:50.254 --> 01:02:51.515]  It's your DNA strands.
[01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:53.356]  When they stop dividing, you die.
[01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:54.417]  The cell dies.
[01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:57.679]  And every time a cell divides, the telomeres get shorter.
[01:02:57.679 --> 01:02:59.760]  It's how many times it can replicate.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:07.406]  Well, you're even allowed to say, with all the discrimination against supplements out there, with PQQ and CoQ10, that they do that because they do.
[01:03:07.406 --> 01:03:10.248]  Nerve growth factor, all of it is in there.
[01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:11.068]  It's back in stock.
[01:03:11.068 --> 01:03:12.189]  A flagship product.
[01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:14.891]  I mean, it's our number one seller when we can get it.
[01:03:15.692 --> 01:03:22.096]  But because it's pharmaceutical, they call it nutraceutical grade, we have a lot of trouble always getting it in anyways, as you know.
[01:03:22.096 --> 01:03:24.557]  So it's sold out for a few months, a few times a year.
[01:03:24.557 --> 01:03:26.158]  It's been sold out for almost seven months.
[01:03:26.158 --> 01:03:30.680]  It's back in stock, but I'm still doing 40% off for those that haven't tried it.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.582]  For all the regulars, I know you've been buying a lot of it.
[01:03:32.582 --> 01:03:33.422]  That's great.
[01:03:33.422 --> 01:03:37.804]  And it's going to go back to full price in about a week.
[01:03:37.804 --> 01:03:39.025]  We've got this Memorial Day special.
[01:03:39.025 --> 01:03:40.326]  I'm going to extend it through next week.
[01:03:41.639 --> 01:03:48.443]  Except some of the products are so close to selling out, or it's going to be so long until we get it back in, they'll go back to regular price before we sell out.
[01:03:48.443 --> 01:04:01.510]  So, DNA Force Plus may go back to regular price, or maybe 10% off, to the 40% off coming up here by Wednesday or so, because it really is an amazing product, and it's very expensive for us to make it.
[01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:08.181]  I mean, to have the real ingredients, these nutraceutical grade ingredients in it is very, very expensive.
[01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:13.822]  I mean, little bitty bottles of it that are the crap type are like $40 a piece just for PQQ or CoQ10.
[01:04:13.822 --> 01:04:16.663]  It's the PQQ that costs the most.
[01:04:16.663 --> 01:04:18.763]  So that is available and it funds the operation.
[01:04:18.763 --> 01:04:20.904]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:04:20.904 --> 01:04:24.985]  We've got a lot of new t-shirts in that I have not designed, but
[01:04:25.265 --> 01:04:27.066]  I've told people.
[01:04:27.066 --> 01:04:28.147]  These are my concepts.
[01:04:28.147 --> 01:04:29.929]  That's why some of the shirts aren't that good.
[01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:30.770]  Some are amazing.
[01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.631]  But I'm the main guy that does the concepts for them.
[01:04:32.631 --> 01:04:35.654]  We've got a bunch of new shirts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:36.714]  We really like them.
[01:04:36.714 --> 01:04:38.016]  And that helps spread the word as well.
[01:04:38.016 --> 01:04:39.817]  So be sure to check those out.
[01:04:39.817 --> 01:04:42.079]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:44.501]  We'll be right back with Chris Sky.
[01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:47.603]  And then I've got a bunch of other news.
[01:04:47.603 --> 01:04:48.124]  Did you hear?
[01:04:48.124 --> 01:04:51.767]  The military's announced a plan to disarm the military.
[01:04:51.767 --> 01:04:52.508]  Yep.
[01:04:52.508 --> 01:04:52.708]  That's 7277.
[01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:53.068]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:11.685]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[01:05:11.685 --> 01:05:12.665]  history.
[01:05:12.665 --> 01:05:17.267]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[01:05:17.267 --> 01:05:19.428]  America is under globalist takeover.
[01:05:20.032 --> 01:05:21.212]  It's an information war.
[01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:22.273]  It is an economic war.
[01:05:22.273 --> 01:05:25.854]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[01:05:25.854 --> 01:05:31.215]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:33.576]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[01:05:33.576 --> 01:05:36.357]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[01:05:36.357 --> 01:05:37.317]  We were the first to lay out
[01:05:38.098 --> 01:05:41.900]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.962]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever.
[01:05:44.962 --> 01:05:49.064]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:05:49.064 --> 01:05:53.646]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[01:05:53.646 --> 01:05:56.228]  So, to all the veterans and all the Patriots, we salute you.
[01:05:56.228 --> 01:05:58.489]  And I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[01:06:15.849 --> 01:06:21.794]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:31.802]  So, I predicted this 16 months ago on air because I was reading the Rockefeller Foundation documents, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:36.486]  And I was reading all the other Bill Gates, U.N.
[01:06:36.486 --> 01:06:39.128]  war games, like Crimson Contagion, Event 201.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:52.650]  And right there they said, we're creating a new society, a new civilization, where the general public is non-essential, where we train people to have less for the environment.
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:58.014]  This is about carbon and cutting carbon to save the Earth from global warming.
[01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.996]  This is not about the virus.
[01:06:59.996 --> 01:07:01.357]  And Bill Gates has said that.
[01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:04.239]  Klaus Schwab has said that.
[01:07:04.239 --> 01:07:08.702]  They have all said that over and over and over again.
[01:07:08.702 --> 01:07:09.083]  And so,
[01:07:11.019 --> 01:07:17.204]  If you look at Australia, or you look at areas of Europe like Germany and Spain, or the UK, they're still locked down.
[01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.845]  They have police horses running over women and children.
[01:07:19.845 --> 01:07:22.107]  They're beating people with billy clubs.
[01:07:22.107 --> 01:07:25.349]  This is all about the general public becoming prisoners.
[01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:26.490]  Learn to be locked in your houses.
[01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:34.416]  I was talking to Craig Jones, who's the number two grappler in the world at this big grappling deal I went to Friday night with Joe Rogan here in Austin.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:08:00.430]  And he was on the show, but he was talking about it after his fight that he won in a record 60 seconds, his bout, we went and had a beer, and he was talking about how his town in Australia, where he lives, has gone back on lockdown, Melbourne, and how when you fly in for 14 days, they lock you in a hotel room, you can't leave the room for 14 days, not even an hour, like a prisoner gets 23 in, one out.
[01:08:02.972 --> 01:08:06.535]  This is all prisoner training.
[01:08:06.535 --> 01:08:13.220]  And so once they train you to do it, once they give you the tracker chips and the face scans and social credit score, it's game over.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.022]  That's the admitted plan.
[01:08:15.022 --> 01:08:27.032]  Well, Chris Sky, who's just a businessman and a patriot up in Canada, he predicted all of this last year.
[01:08:27.032 --> 01:08:28.773]  And now everything he said came true.
[01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:29.874]  So I want to play a clip of him.
[01:08:31.326 --> 01:08:42.995]  Almost a year ago, predicting all of this because he had a document that's now been confirmed of how they were never going to get rid of the lockdowns, how they'd have lockdown three and then lockdown four, they're now going under the next lockdown.
[01:08:42.995 --> 01:08:49.920]  They're arresting pastors, closing churches, but Walmart and Target are open because they are essential.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.522]  This is total corporate takeover tyranny.
[01:08:52.522 --> 01:08:57.066]  And then we'll talk about one of the premiers up in Canada, Mr. Ford,
[01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:00.712]  Who tells people this is basically going to be permanent.
[01:09:00.712 --> 01:09:04.275]  You can't have one case and they've got to do this.
[01:09:04.275 --> 01:09:06.657]  One case of something that's totally exaggerated.
[01:09:06.657 --> 01:09:08.638]  The PCR test were almost completely fake.
[01:09:08.638 --> 01:09:14.923]  So Chris Guy always has a lot to say, but let's hear from him last year predicting exactly what happened.
[01:09:16.298 --> 01:09:19.340]  ...clients, because they know Canadians like to do what they're told.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:23.383]  So they tell you you have to wear a mask, next they're going to tell you you have to contact trace.
[01:09:23.383 --> 01:09:25.645]  Then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine.
[01:09:25.645 --> 01:09:29.447]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[01:09:29.447 --> 01:09:30.888]  And then guess what, kids?
[01:09:30.888 --> 01:09:34.651]  Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know any better...
[01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:39.596]  They're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was going to be.
[01:09:39.596 --> 01:09:49.365]  So now you still got to wear your mask, still got to get contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine.
[01:09:49.365 --> 01:09:50.366]  There you go.
[01:09:50.366 --> 01:09:54.290]  And we're going to go to him here in just a moment.
[01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.012]  But I wanted to play that clip.
[01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:07.335]  of one of the premiers, Mr. Ford, talking about martial law just a few months ago so that people understand exactly what's going on.
[01:10:07.335 --> 01:10:14.558]  So this is the Ontario government, Doug Ford, announcing an extended province-wide stay-at-home order and new restrictions.
[01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:18.699]  That's called martial law, including checkpoints where they ask where you're going.
[01:10:18.699 --> 01:10:20.220]  Here it is.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.321]  So effective immediately.
[01:10:22.321 --> 01:10:24.382]  We're extending the emergency declaration.
[01:10:25.618 --> 01:10:27.359]  We'll be closing all non-essential construction.
[01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:58.875]  We're restricting all outdoor recreational amenities, such as golf courses, basketball courts, soccer fields and playgrounds.
[01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:04.938]  We're reducing capacity in big box retail even further to 25%.
[01:11:04.938 --> 01:11:12.440]  Beginning on Monday, places of worship will be capped at a maximum of 10 people indoors.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.103]  To get ahead of the variants that are plaguing Western Canada, beginning Monday,
[01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:24.690]  We're setting up checkpoints at all interprovincial borders.
[01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:38.358]  We'll be limiting access to border crossings between Ontario and the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec, with exceptions such as work, medical care, or transportation of goods.
[01:11:38.358 --> 01:11:44.202]  And we're calling on the federal government to immediately tighten up our international borders.
[01:11:45.652 --> 01:11:49.517]  We're currently facing the devastating consequences.
[01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:50.518]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:11:50.518 --> 01:11:52.481]  Now, we know a lot about the PCR test.
[01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:55.685]  If you haven't had the vaccine, they turn it up to 40 to make you false positive.
[01:11:56.495 --> 01:11:58.676]  94% of the time, they admit that New York Times.
[01:11:58.676 --> 01:12:05.419]  If you've had the vaccine but of course you're sick from it, they will turn it down to 28 so that you'll get all false negatives.
[01:12:05.419 --> 01:12:18.405]  Chris Sky joins us because people need to not go back to sleep in Texas and Florida and even New York's basically back open now and understand that the next phases are coming and that the beta test is Canada and other areas.
[01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:20.286]  If you're a radio listener, we're rolling footage of
[01:12:20.806 --> 01:12:38.213]  Germans being attacked with water cannons, women's heads being split open, in the UK, giant Clydesdales running over women, almost killing women, just beating people with billy clubs, arresting children, people arrested walking their dogs, German shepherds attacking families.
[01:12:38.213 --> 01:12:44.576]  I mean, this is just, and it's all you indirected, world government, in the name of saving us from something that is pure bull.
[01:12:44.576 --> 01:12:46.936]  You have just also been arrested and got out of jail.
[01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:48.017]  Chris Scott, thanks for joining us.
[01:12:49.406 --> 01:12:50.847]  Thank you for having me once again.
[01:12:50.847 --> 01:13:08.577]  This is a very important broadcast because we had a lot of important information that we were getting out to the public and the number one thing they were trying to do was stop me from going on tour again because our last tour was so successful we call it the Freedom Convoy Tour and I had to drive all the way to Vancouver because they put me on the no-fly list.
[01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:19.645]  And we drove from Vancouver all the way to Montreal, and when we ended up in Montreal on May 1st, there were 300,000 people on the streets with me, marching in solidarity to end these lockdowns.
[01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:24.349]  And the government didn't want anybody to know about that, and the last thing the government wanted was a repeat of that.
[01:13:24.349 --> 01:13:32.435]  And so when I told everybody that I was going to do a repeat tour, and we were calling it the Just Say No Tour to launch my new book, which is right here, Just Say No.
[01:13:32.435 --> 01:13:34.937]  Oh, sorry, it's upside down.
[01:13:34.937 --> 01:13:36.498]  They did everything they could to stop me.
[01:13:37.222 --> 01:13:43.965]  First of all, they arrested me the day before I was supposed to leave to go to Vancouver, thinking it was going to stop me.
[01:13:43.965 --> 01:13:45.725]  I got out of jail that very same day.
[01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:49.027]  I had to make alternate arrangements to leave to make it there.
[01:13:49.027 --> 01:13:58.311]  I had, I left at Friday at midnight to get to Vancouver at Sunday at 2 p.m., which was over 5,000 kilometers or roughly 3,500 mile drive.
[01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:08.316]  And with the help of patriots around Canada, we had nine different cars take us from place to place to place, including a helicopter to get us there on time.
[01:14:08.316 --> 01:14:14.641]  And then the day before my book was supposed to go on sale, which was May 25th, it was supposed to go on sale at Amazon Books.
[01:14:14.641 --> 01:14:26.731]  Amazon announced for the very first time ever in history that this book right here, Just Say No, is the first book in history to be banned by Amazon the day before it was to go on sale.
[01:14:27.111 --> 01:14:31.855]  They tried to do that to stop me, because they tried to stop me from going by making me in jail.
[01:14:31.855 --> 01:14:32.736]  That didn't work.
[01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:36.679]  They tried to stop me from going by making it so I can't drive, I can't fly.
[01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:41.023]  They confiscated all my legally owned firearms and weapons.
[01:14:41.023 --> 01:14:45.747]  So I had to stay with my bail surety, who actually comes on tour with me, thankfully.
[01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:48.029]  So that's the only reason I was allowed to do this tour.
[01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:52.092]  And then, even when I went on tour, I was supposed to make a stop in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
[01:14:52.092 --> 01:14:55.195]  Our governments are now so corrupt, so lawless,
[01:14:55.635 --> 01:15:01.882]  That they got a preemptive warrant for me and four other people before the event even happened.
[01:15:01.882 --> 01:15:05.966]  So now in Canada they can give you arrest warrants for things you have not even done.
[01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:06.607]  Alright, stay there.
[01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:07.368]  Let's explain.
[01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:09.049]  This is all UN directed.
[01:15:09.049 --> 01:15:10.391]  The UN puts out a statement.
[01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:12.533]  Big Tech enforces it with the police.
[01:15:12.533 --> 01:15:15.076]  And the model is Canada coming to America next.
[01:15:15.556 --> 01:15:34.555]  To literally with a guy with no criminal record start arresting you attacking you for traveling around saying let's end this lockdown in Germany they're trying to pass a law five years in prison if you criticize the lockdown yes folks Australia similar things Facebook banned members of Parliament from Facebook in Australia if they criticize the lockdown
[01:15:35.215 --> 01:15:43.940]  And you saw the big tech whistleblowers on this show and Tucker Carlson last week from Facebook where they say when someone tells the truth, that's who they particularly ban.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:50.464]  And so, Facebook by the way spies on people in Europe and calls the police on them and they get arrested live on Facebook.
[01:15:50.464 --> 01:15:52.525]  This is serious because what they're doing is criminal.
[01:15:52.525 --> 01:15:53.926]  They've got to suppress our speech.
[01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:55.387]  Showing our speech is powerful.
[01:15:55.387 --> 01:15:55.807]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.896 --> 01:16:10.659]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans, but at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[01:16:10.659 --> 01:16:11.659]  history.
[01:16:11.659 --> 01:16:16.260]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.421]  America is under globalist takeover.
[01:16:19.005 --> 01:16:20.205]  It's an information war.
[01:16:20.205 --> 01:16:21.266]  It is an economic war.
[01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:24.827]  But most importantly, it is a spiritual war.
[01:16:24.827 --> 01:16:30.188]  And now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[01:16:30.188 --> 01:16:32.549]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:35.370]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:36.310]  We were the first to lay out
[01:16:37.074 --> 01:16:40.875]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:43.956]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:48.337]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:52.618]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[01:16:52.618 --> 01:16:57.780]  So, to all the veterans and all the Patriots, we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.280]  InfoWars delivers.
[01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:02.579]  We have proven ourselves to be the tip of the spear.
[01:17:02.579 --> 01:17:05.162]  That our research is the best out there, period.
[01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.005]  And I don't say that arrogantly.
[01:17:07.005 --> 01:17:12.052]  I say that from long decades of research and fighting hard in the trenches.
[01:17:12.868 --> 01:17:16.649]  And I know that without your support, none of this would have been possible.
[01:17:16.649 --> 01:17:25.632]  So I thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you to continue to support InfoWars, symbiotically with a 360 win, by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:25.632 --> 01:17:28.353]  Through Memorial Day, we have the biggest sale yet of the year.
[01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:29.894]  Storewide free shipping, double pay-per-view points.
[01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:31.615]  I always shoot you straight.
[01:17:59.955 --> 01:18:03.671]  And what I've told you over the years is that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air.
[01:18:03.671 --> 01:18:04.193]  It's been true.
[01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:11.382]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[01:18:11.382 --> 01:18:13.504]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[01:18:13.504 --> 01:18:15.645]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[01:18:15.645 --> 01:18:16.426]  It's okay.
[01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:18.808]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[01:18:18.808 --> 01:18:20.869]  We're having a great effect.
[01:18:20.869 --> 01:18:21.990]  We're exposing evil.
[01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.231]  You're exposing evil.
[01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:31.917]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[01:18:31.917 --> 01:18:32.377]  So again,
[01:18:33.057 --> 01:18:53.721]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the armed forces because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[01:18:53.721 --> 01:18:55.142]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[01:18:55.142 --> 01:18:57.402]  I want to thank you all for your support and ask you to support us again.
[01:18:57.862 --> 01:19:05.147]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[01:19:05.147 --> 01:19:11.951]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[01:19:11.951 --> 01:19:18.975]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[01:19:18.975 --> 01:19:23.538]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[01:19:23.778 --> 01:19:25.739]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:28.320]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.180]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.721]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:37.003]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[01:19:37.003 --> 01:19:47.106]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times more effective than its competitors.
[01:19:47.106 --> 01:19:51.027]  BioSeptic Pro is safe for plumbing, human, animal, and aquatic life.
[01:19:51.027 --> 01:19:53.088]  Secure your BioSeptic Pro today.
[01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.210]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:56.471]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:19:56.471 --> 01:19:57.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:19.179 --> 01:20:22.240]  Okay, so Chris Skyes was a successful business guy up in Canada.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.501]  I looked into him.
[01:20:23.501 --> 01:20:28.383]  And the last year, he's become one of the leading voices traveling around the world.
[01:20:28.383 --> 01:20:32.244]  Europe, you name it, exposing what was coming off the UN's own documents.
[01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.525]  And that's really what blows people away.
[01:20:33.525 --> 01:20:35.806]  This is all a UN worldwide drill.
[01:20:36.681 --> 01:20:38.143]  For a bioweapon being released.
[01:20:38.143 --> 01:20:39.945]  They released a real gain-of-function virus.
[01:20:39.945 --> 01:20:41.286]  Doesn't kill many people.
[01:20:41.286 --> 01:20:42.327]  But it is a chimera.
[01:20:42.327 --> 01:20:45.271]  Scientists knew that when they first looked at it over a year ago.
[01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:45.871]  We told you.
[01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:46.973]  We're vindicated.
[01:20:46.973 --> 01:20:48.935]  And we told you more lockdowns are coming.
[01:20:48.935 --> 01:20:55.082]  And even in places like Texas where the lockdowns pretty much ended, they're planning on bringing it back if the truth doesn't come out.
[01:20:55.082 --> 01:20:56.043]  So you heard Chris Sky.
[01:20:56.983 --> 01:21:04.950]  Who has been arrested, harassed, had 30 police cars come to his house because he dared, you know, go walk around the supermarket and interview people.
[01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:07.773]  They don't want people communicating.
[01:21:07.773 --> 01:21:11.936]  And they admit they don't want anyone but the UN being able to have this speech.
[01:21:11.936 --> 01:21:16.220]  And the left has called for anti-lockdown protesters to be arrested.
[01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:19.425]  They've been attacking him all over the world.
[01:21:19.425 --> 01:21:21.446]  Germany, England, you name it.
[01:21:21.446 --> 01:21:24.148]  And so just absolutely criminal activity.
[01:21:24.148 --> 01:21:28.390]  But I know Doug Ford, when he called for martial law, he did another lockdown.
[01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:30.191]  I know that he was very unpopular.
[01:21:30.191 --> 01:21:31.592]  He later had to apologize.
[01:21:31.592 --> 01:21:33.634]  So, Chris Guy, you've got a lot to say.
[01:21:33.634 --> 01:21:35.795]  You filled us in on the harassment.
[01:21:36.255 --> 01:21:36.776]  We're good to go.
[01:21:59.187 --> 01:22:00.828]  Yeah, and they didn't even give me a reason.
[01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:06.213]  They basically said they're just reserving the right to say no, which is hilarious because that's the title of the book.
[01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:08.174]  And they had no problems with it prior to that.
[01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:09.155]  I did all the paperwork.
[01:22:09.155 --> 01:22:10.336]  I talked to all the representatives.
[01:22:10.336 --> 01:22:11.497]  I did everything they want.
[01:22:11.497 --> 01:22:19.903]  So now the only place that the book is available is either in person when I'm on tour, and lots of people have been buying, or on my website realchrissky.com.
[01:22:21.164 --> 01:22:25.767]  And I urge everybody to not just buy it for them, but buy it for someone who doesn't understand what's really going on.
[01:22:25.767 --> 01:22:35.192]  Buy it for someone who's on the fence and just needs to know, to have that inspiration and that knowledge that will give them the hope that they need to get through this.
[01:22:35.192 --> 01:22:37.233]  Because this book, it'll do that.
[01:22:37.233 --> 01:22:41.255]  For people that are awake, it'll give them the inspiration and the knowledge to speak out further.
[01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:44.877]  For people that are on the fence and have questions, they won't have questions after they read this book.
[01:22:45.277 --> 01:22:56.766]  And for people that haven't even asked questions, for people that are still sitting at home with two masks on, waiting for this to be over, waiting for the government to give them their freedom back, this book will do what the government is more afraid of than anything.
[01:22:56.766 --> 01:22:58.907]  It will get people to ask questions.
[01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:02.910]  This book has the ability to spark a national and even international conversation.
[01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:07.874]  I totally agree, and they're also trying to censor a very important book put up by a medical doctor.
[01:23:08.974 --> 01:23:09.795]  We're good to go.
[01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:31.472]  Because there are printers printing more right now.
[01:23:31.472 --> 01:23:35.998]  I'm going to buy 10,000 of his book and sell it at infowarestore.com.
[01:23:35.998 --> 01:23:39.543]  Because knowledge is power, and we've got to circumvent these censors.
[01:23:39.543 --> 01:23:42.667]  Again, Chris, explain what's happening in Canada.
[01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:45.030]  Churches still closed, Walmart opened.
[01:23:45.899 --> 01:23:47.120]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.022]  I actually went to Pastor Art's church in the Calgary, the famed pastor.
[01:23:51.022 --> 01:23:53.563]  I was privileged enough to even speak there.
[01:23:53.563 --> 01:24:02.007]  And then I watched him get arrested, straight up Nazi style, on the middle of the highway, on his knees, carried away by multiple police officers.
[01:24:02.527 --> 01:24:08.634]  Now they're issuing warrants in places like Manitoba to organizers of events before the events even happen.
[01:24:08.634 --> 01:24:12.879]  This is literal pre-crime on display.
[01:24:12.879 --> 01:24:18.685]  I have a warrant out for my arrest apparently in Manitoba for an event I never even went to.
[01:24:19.292 --> 01:24:22.974]  This is absolute lunacy, and they're doing it because they can.
[01:24:22.974 --> 01:24:25.956]  This is what I was talking about, the Nazi arrest of the pastor.
[01:24:25.956 --> 01:24:36.242]  And we've seen other pastors get arrested, but we've seen wonderful institutions like the JCCF, Justice Center for Constitutional Freedoms, standing up for people like myself, standing up for people like the pastor.
[01:24:36.242 --> 01:24:39.364]  They actually took on my no-fly case, and they're going to be working on it.
[01:24:39.364 --> 01:24:44.747]  And they had some, they filed injunctions against multiple governments against these illegal measures that they're pulling.
[01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.288]  The governments aren't even cutting corners.
[01:24:46.368 --> 01:24:48.370]  By the way, these aren't police officers.
[01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.831]  These are beyond Nazis.
[01:24:49.831 --> 01:24:51.712]  These are the enemy.
[01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:52.873]  They are, 100%.
[01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:56.016]  The police officers are more than like on our side.
[01:24:56.016 --> 01:24:58.318]  When I talk to police officers... Well, I want to be clear.
[01:24:58.318 --> 01:24:59.259]  The good cops are good.
[01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:03.242]  I mean, the cops that follow orders to close churches are serving Satan.
[01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:04.793]  We're good to go.
[01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:27.935]  They're basically glorified security guards that they put in police-like uniforms.
[01:25:27.935 --> 01:25:31.577]  They don't even have guns or anything like that, but they've been given arrest powers.
[01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:33.539]  And these are the kind of guys that have the bad attitude.
[01:25:33.539 --> 01:25:35.540]  These are the kind of guys that are looking for trouble.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.603]  And that's why they unleash them on protesters, because they want to agitate, they want to cause violence, they want to cause a division.
[01:25:40.603 --> 01:25:50.750]  And again, they put black tarps up around huge churches for months, put hundreds of police there, and let no one go in major churches down the streets from topless bars that aren't open.
[01:25:51.815 --> 01:25:52.295]  That's right.
[01:25:52.295 --> 01:25:54.016]  And I can tell you why they don't want people at churches.
[01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:55.716]  Because I was there at Pastor Art's church.
[01:25:55.716 --> 01:25:57.897]  And when people are there, they feel hopeful.
[01:25:57.897 --> 01:25:58.877]  They feel togetherness.
[01:25:58.877 --> 01:25:59.918]  They feel unity.
[01:25:59.918 --> 01:26:03.019]  They feel everything that you need in order to get through this.
[01:26:03.019 --> 01:26:04.239]  And in order to fight back.
[01:26:04.239 --> 01:26:07.260]  And the government wants you to feel isolated, hopeless, despair.
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:10.341]  And that's why they hate this more than anything.
[01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:15.363]  Because not only does it expose all their lies, it empowers you to stand up for yourself.
[01:26:15.363 --> 01:26:16.203]  It gives you the knowledge.
[01:26:16.203 --> 01:26:17.084]  It gives you the power.
[01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:18.144]  It gives you the courage.
[01:26:18.704 --> 01:26:21.186]  And you've got to go to RealChrisSky.com and get it.
[01:26:21.186 --> 01:26:24.247]  And it's going to be available, like he said, on his site soon.
[01:26:24.247 --> 01:26:29.030]  I'm really excited about that because I need this book to get into everybody's head.
[01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:30.991]  Listen, I want to get 100,000 of these out of you.
[01:26:30.991 --> 01:26:35.093]  You and I were even talking about after you sell an additional amount, just be able to fund yourself on this term.
[01:26:35.093 --> 01:26:36.654]  We're talking about selling them basically at cost.
[01:26:36.934 --> 01:26:39.617]  Because we need millions of these books to get out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:39.617 --> 01:26:40.719]  This is a total war.
[01:26:40.719 --> 01:26:43.002]  So Chris, continue for folks that don't know.
[01:26:43.002 --> 01:26:45.104]  People are like, oh, who cares about Canada or Australia?
[01:26:45.104 --> 01:26:46.766]  This is all UN-directed.
[01:26:46.766 --> 01:26:48.588]  The same stuff is coming here.
[01:26:48.588 --> 01:26:51.071]  Why are they keeping Canada permanently locked down?
[01:26:51.071 --> 01:26:53.074]  Why are they saying Germany may never reopen?
[01:26:53.937 --> 01:26:54.698]  Very simple.
[01:26:54.698 --> 01:26:57.020]  Canada is the prize on the worldwide stage.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.384]  If you're a super villain and you wanted to take over any country in the world that you could, Canada is the prize.
[01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:09.130]  The largest landmass, unlimited amount of resources, and the smallest, weakest population you can imagine.
[01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:10.751]  And that's why we have the worst lockdown.
[01:27:10.751 --> 01:27:17.357]  Because we don't have the balls, we don't have the fortitude, we don't have the freedom-loving instinct of some place like Florida or Texas.
[01:27:17.717 --> 01:27:19.317]  And that's what I tell every Canadian.
[01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.998]  The government didn't close your business.
[01:27:20.998 --> 01:27:23.278]  You closed your business and you're keeping it closed.
[01:27:23.278 --> 01:27:25.359]  The government didn't put a mask on your children.
[01:27:25.359 --> 01:27:26.139]  You did!
[01:27:26.139 --> 01:27:27.900]  The government didn't put a mask on you.
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.860]  You're putting it on yourself every day.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:32.341]  And Canadians are the best of the world at making excuses.
[01:27:32.341 --> 01:27:34.421]  They want to be called the nicest people in the world.
[01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:36.142]  And our government loves to push that around the world.
[01:27:36.142 --> 01:27:36.902]  Canadians are nice.
[01:27:37.382 --> 01:27:40.585]  The origin of the word nice in Latin is ignorant and naive.
[01:27:40.585 --> 01:27:42.547]  Meaning you're easy to take advantage of.
[01:27:42.547 --> 01:27:45.349]  And when they do take advantage of you, they know you're not going to do anything.
[01:27:45.349 --> 01:27:47.431]  And Canadians are a perfect example of that.
[01:27:47.431 --> 01:27:51.374]  And they want to make an example of people like me, so Canadians won't stand up.
[01:27:51.374 --> 01:27:52.855]  And they've arrested me multiple times.
[01:27:52.855 --> 01:27:54.516]  They've put such conditions on me.
[01:27:54.516 --> 01:27:58.200]  And by the way, explain to folks, you have the highest suicide rate now in the world.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.041]  Your children are killing themselves.
[01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.243]  This nanny state is vicious and is killing.
[01:28:03.246 --> 01:28:06.289]  The nanny state is way worse than COVID itself.
[01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:12.354]  The consequences of lockdown, like the raging suicides in children, the overdoses... I just came from British Columbia.
[01:28:12.354 --> 01:28:16.298]  There's more overdose deaths for people under 60 than there are COVID deaths.
[01:28:16.298 --> 01:28:17.880]  And we're talking about a pandemic?
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.760]  Give me a break.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:23.645]  The real pandemic, the real catastrophe is all the unrelated deaths to lockdowns.
[01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.306]  The virus didn't close businesses.
[01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:27.627]  The virus didn't cause suicide.
[01:28:27.627 --> 01:28:30.148]  The virus didn't cause divorces, overdoses.
[01:28:30.148 --> 01:28:34.591]  No, that's the consequences of government shutdown and it's all planned.
[01:28:34.591 --> 01:28:45.517]  The government wants total control so they're using the vaccine passport to take away your rights and freedoms and they're using the fact that they're closing your businesses and putting you on universal basic income to control you physically.
[01:28:45.517 --> 01:28:51.880]  And for the rest of the people that still have a little property left, they're going to be coming for that too and we'll be talking about that in the next segment because this has to
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:52.461]  That's right.
[01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:55.323]  Let's talk about the next phase of what they admit they're going to do.
[01:28:55.323 --> 01:28:58.106]  It's in all the Klaus Schwab documents.
[01:28:58.106 --> 01:29:00.709]  I've been on air 27 years.
[01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:04.473]  And we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[01:29:05.347 --> 01:29:16.796]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air and the world would be a different place.
[01:29:16.796 --> 01:29:20.499]  So it's not a power trip when I realized the great effect we've had.
[01:29:20.499 --> 01:29:26.864]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[01:29:27.644 --> 01:29:31.267]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[01:29:31.267 --> 01:29:34.069]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[01:29:34.069 --> 01:29:38.652]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[01:29:38.652 --> 01:29:41.794]  And so, InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[01:29:41.794 --> 01:29:45.296]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:47.157]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[01:29:47.157 --> 01:29:48.398]  It's so expensive.
[01:29:48.398 --> 01:29:53.702]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:53.702 --> 01:29:57.244]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have 4-month free shipping and double-Patreon points.
[01:30:01.005 --> 01:30:03.065]  Your voice counts.
[01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:08.127]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[01:30:08.127 --> 01:30:10.707]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[01:30:10.707 --> 01:30:12.208]  They know you're angry.
[01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:17.029]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:28.368]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[01:30:58.436 --> 01:31:07.061]  Memorial Day 2021 is here, and that means store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points at InfowarStore.com.
[01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:15.545]  And on top of it, a lot of our best-selling products that have been sold out for up to six months because of the COVID supply chain problems are finally back in stock.
[01:31:15.545 --> 01:31:22.189]  And that's a good thing, because these are products that are really good for you and your family, good for your immune system, good for your cells, good for your body.
[01:31:22.469 --> 01:31:26.890]  All of them are amazing, but DNA Force Plus is, again, the flagship.
[01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:29.731]  It's got the PQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:31.691]  It helps your telomeres last longer.
[01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:33.592]  It cleans out your mitochondria.
[01:31:33.592 --> 01:31:34.732]  The list goes on and on.
[01:31:34.732 --> 01:31:40.314]  It is 40% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:31:40.314 --> 01:31:41.974]  That's an unprecedented deal.
[01:31:41.974 --> 01:31:43.574]  What else is back in stock?
[01:31:43.574 --> 01:31:45.315]  People are very excited to hear.
[01:31:45.315 --> 01:31:45.995]  Pollen Block.
[01:31:46.415 --> 01:31:51.016]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials and right now we've got store-wide free shipping, we've got
[01:32:07.142 --> 01:32:08.344]  Double Patriot points.
[01:32:08.344 --> 01:32:12.209]  We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven months.
[01:32:12.209 --> 01:32:17.937]  We've got 50% off on Ultra 12, 50% off on Vaso Beats, 50% off on Alpha Power.
[01:32:17.937 --> 01:32:19.078]  These are all incredible products.
[01:32:19.078 --> 01:32:22.022]  I could talk about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you have already
[01:32:22.022 --> 01:32:23.322]  Some of you have already used them, some of you haven't.
[01:32:23.322 --> 01:32:24.363]  You've got to go check these out.
[01:32:24.363 --> 01:32:33.885]  These are all top-of-the-line formulas, some of them clones of best-sellers, others original formulations that we came up with, with top developers to blow people away.
[01:32:33.885 --> 01:32:34.565]  And it's all there.
[01:32:34.565 --> 01:32:42.507]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales and specials to mention them all here today.
[01:32:42.507 --> 01:32:47.468]  But whatever you do, go to InfoWorksShore.com where there's free shipping and double Patreon points.
[01:32:47.948 --> 01:32:49.629]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.609 --> 01:33:17.792]  Alright, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:20.376]  Here's a war on for your mind, Chris Sky.
[01:33:20.376 --> 01:33:24.461]  Ride the shotgun with us until this hour ends, and then Owen Schroer goes live.
[01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:25.983]  Take your calls, guests, and more.
[01:33:25.983 --> 01:33:27.205]  6 to 8 p.m.
[01:33:27.205 --> 01:33:29.368]  It's called Sunday Live on Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.368 --> 01:33:30.529]  Of course, weekdays, 11 a.m.
[01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:34.671]  We've got some big guests that I'm going to put on the War Room this week.
[01:33:59.005 --> 01:34:02.488]  I'm sitting here, and quite a few people listen to the show.
[01:34:02.488 --> 01:34:11.174]  So we're talking about dictatorship in Canada, and I just got sent an interesting text by a very well-known talk show host, I'll leave it at that, saying, have you seen this?
[01:34:11.174 --> 01:34:17.698]  And I said, during the little short break, I said, no, that's incredible, and I sent it to the producers to play it.
[01:34:17.698 --> 01:34:23.042]  And I didn't just believe the clip, I went and did a search and found out that indeed, he bragged that he bought the media off.
[01:34:23.042 --> 01:34:24.523]  We're going to play it in a moment.
[01:34:24.523 --> 01:34:26.084]  I didn't know he'd said this.
[01:34:26.084 --> 01:34:27.505]  So I shoot the talk show host,
[01:34:28.337 --> 01:34:29.458]  Household name.
[01:34:29.458 --> 01:34:32.699]  Back, I'm not bragging, it's just a funny small world.
[01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:37.782]  I sent him back Trudeau saying, I want to be a dictator like China.
[01:34:37.782 --> 01:34:39.203]  He hadn't seen that.
[01:34:39.203 --> 01:34:43.165]  So it shows how, don't think everybody knows stuff.
[01:34:43.165 --> 01:34:46.547]  I see people all the time going, Jones, you haven't covered this because I didn't know about it.
[01:34:47.418 --> 01:34:49.379]  I mean, this is so over the top.
[01:34:49.379 --> 01:34:51.700]  So Trudeau admires Xi Jinping.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:56.423]  His dad admired the previous communist dictator and wrote books about how he wanted communism.
[01:34:56.423 --> 01:35:02.947]  Here he is saying he wants it, and now he's got his premiers over your provinces from coast to coast.
[01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:08.650]  Like you said, you're one of the biggest countries in the world, incredible resources, only rivaled by Russia.
[01:35:08.650 --> 01:35:09.630]  Way more than the U.S.
[01:35:09.630 --> 01:35:10.311]  has.
[01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:16.014]  And you're being taken over, and people have no defense mechanism in Canada, because you were a Christian society.
[01:35:16.514 --> 01:35:27.900]  Now, you're a globalist society, and you said the people are wide open to this, but people don't seem to understand how much danger the world's in, and that Canada is just the start, that that's where the globalists had their free hand.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:33.563]  Like you said, it's where a supervillain would strike first.
[01:35:33.563 --> 01:35:37.665]  Exactly, and that's exactly what we're seeing, and that's why we're seeing it so harshly.
[01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:42.988]  There's a statistic that just got released a couple days ago, that our gyms have been closed 322 days out of the last 365 days.
[01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:52.776]  What business can survive being closed 90% of the time over an entire year?
[01:35:52.776 --> 01:35:53.417]  Answer?
[01:35:53.417 --> 01:35:54.197]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:35:54.197 --> 01:35:55.138]  And that's what they want.
[01:35:55.138 --> 01:36:01.483]  They want to crush small business because when you are an independent business owner, you are independent.
[01:36:01.483 --> 01:36:03.485]  You look after yourself.
[01:36:03.485 --> 01:36:05.266]  The people that work for you look after themselves.
[01:36:05.266 --> 01:36:07.308]  The government serves you as they're supposed to.
[01:36:07.308 --> 01:36:11.191]  As soon as the government closes your business, puts you out of work, puts everybody that worked for you out of work,
[01:36:11.611 --> 01:36:16.075]  Now you rely on universal basic income or stimulus checks or whatever the hell they want to call it.
[01:36:16.075 --> 01:36:17.436]  The government no longer serves you.
[01:36:17.436 --> 01:36:18.637]  The government rules you.
[01:36:18.637 --> 01:36:23.281]  And they can make you do things like take vaccines or do contact tracing or do forced testing.
[01:36:23.281 --> 01:36:24.843]  And if you disagree, you don't get your money.
[01:36:25.501 --> 01:36:31.887]  And now they're combining that with the vaccine passport that's going to take away your rights and freedoms forever, so they hope.
[01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:37.632]  And now you have a system where you have no rights and freedoms, and the government controls you financially.
[01:36:37.632 --> 01:36:39.093]  So what's going to happen?
[01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:46.660]  That means we're going to have really high taxes, rampant inflation, and for the rest of the people that still have jobs and still have property, they're coming for them next.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:50.684]  They already are talking about their government-insured reverse mortgage program.
[01:36:50.684 --> 01:37:01.114]  And that's because when inflation and taxes take over, all the people that are at baby boomer age and ready to retire aren't going to have the money left that they need to live out their life.
[01:37:01.114 --> 01:37:03.716]  So the government's going to come and say, we've got a great idea for you.
[01:37:03.716 --> 01:37:05.438]  Government-insured reverse mortgage.
[01:37:05.438 --> 01:37:08.500]  We're going to give you thousands of dollars every month for the next 10 or 15 years.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.743]  You'll be able to look like kings and queens.
[01:37:10.743 --> 01:37:12.024]  Only problem is, when you're done,
[01:37:12.734 --> 01:37:14.015]  They own your house.
[01:37:14.015 --> 01:37:17.416]  So this is the way they're going to recoup all the property.
[01:37:17.416 --> 01:37:18.696]  It's the biggest transfer of property.
[01:37:18.696 --> 01:37:20.457]  And by the way, Klaus Schwab has said that.
[01:37:20.457 --> 01:37:27.539]  He says in the future you will own nothing, you will have nothing, and you will like it, but then they'll dictate total control over you.
[01:37:27.539 --> 01:37:28.420]  Exactly.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.880]  Their future looks something like this.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.541]  I'll go through it real quick.
[01:37:31.541 --> 01:37:34.302]  If you're living by yourself, you're in 150 square foot.
[01:37:34.302 --> 01:37:37.283]  If you're living with another person, you're in 250 square feet.
[01:37:37.283 --> 01:37:42.445]  You may or may not have a bathroom in your condo slash prison cell, depending on your social status.
[01:37:42.785 --> 01:37:52.813]  You will live in a giant building complex where you will work from, you will eat, you will shop at Starbucks, get your hair cut, do your grocery shopping, get your clothing, so you virtually never leave.
[01:37:52.813 --> 01:37:56.957]  If you are going to leave, if you have a job where you need to get to, you don't have a car.
[01:37:56.957 --> 01:37:57.497]  No, no, no.
[01:37:57.497 --> 01:38:08.045]  You walk outside, you scan the barcode on your wrist, and you see if you have enough dividend credits left in your bank account to rent that e-bike that's going to take you the 15 minutes to get to your job.
[01:38:08.045 --> 01:38:08.746]  This is the kind of
[01:38:09.907 --> 01:38:23.996]  And if you socially go out and protest to take guns, protest to forcibly inoculate, protest or like sterilize your five-year-old son, if you were even able to be able to have a child, with all the chemicals in the food and water, then they'll give you enough credits to be able to buy food.
[01:38:23.996 --> 01:38:27.858]  But if you don't go out and behave the way they want, you won't, that's the social credit score.
[01:38:28.675 --> 01:38:29.535]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:29.535 --> 01:38:33.576]  You go on a show like this, you take a picture with someone like you or me, your social credit score drops.
[01:38:33.576 --> 01:38:35.876]  Now all of a sudden you can't travel internationally.
[01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.597]  Then you do something else they don't like, now all of a sudden you can't work.
[01:38:38.597 --> 01:38:42.058]  You do something else they don't like, now you can't even access your digital wallet.
[01:38:42.058 --> 01:38:52.840]  We're talking about a world where you won't even be able to sell your used shoes on friggin eBay without the government knowing, having to give you permission, tracking, tracing, and taking their piece of the pie.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:58.963]  They are going to control every aspect of your life from cradle to grave, and they're setting it all up with this COVID virus.
[01:38:58.963 --> 01:39:03.265]  And that's why they do not want people reading my book, because it exposes all of that.
[01:39:03.265 --> 01:39:03.965]  Everything!
[01:39:03.965 --> 01:39:21.834]  It exposes their lives, it makes people ask questions, and when we can spark an international conversation at the highest levels of government, we can expose these people, and we can hold them accountable, and we can make sure that we restructure society in a way that it benefits everybody, not just those people at the top, and we make such examples of them that this never happens
[01:39:21.994 --> 01:39:22.754]  Exactly.
[01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:31.657]  This great reset could be the real reset over the globalists because they've stolen the planet, they've created thousands of trillions of dollars of fake derivatives.
[01:39:31.657 --> 01:39:44.101]  Now they want to reset it and act like they're the saviors and tell us the collapse is because of COVID when the collapse was them ordering the shutdown with the whole third world starving to death now being organized as political weapons against the West.
[01:39:44.101 --> 01:39:45.622]  Now here's the new clip I hadn't seen.
[01:39:46.423 --> 01:39:47.544]  This is Trudeau.
[01:39:47.544 --> 01:39:54.248]  Last year, he gave $600 million to the media, and he openly makes jokes about taxpayer-funded media.
[01:39:54.248 --> 01:39:55.768]  Here it is.
[01:39:55.768 --> 01:40:06.735]  Now, you sometimes hear about liberal bias in the media these days, how they're constantly letting off our government, letting our government off the hook for no good reason.
[01:40:06.735 --> 01:40:08.796]  Frankly, I think that's insulting.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:14.229]  It's clear that they let us off the hook for a very good reason.
[01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:18.336]  Because we paid them 600 million dollars.
[01:40:18.336 --> 01:40:19.197]  That's not edited.
[01:40:19.197 --> 01:40:20.360]  He goes on.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.622]  That's the sick joke.
[01:40:21.622 --> 01:40:22.584]  That's the rubbing it in.
[01:40:23.914 --> 01:40:24.475]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:24.475 --> 01:40:26.938]  They make jokes about it to us now.
[01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:28.860]  They don't even hide what they're doing anymore.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:39.051]  And by the way, when he proposed what he started doing about a year and a half ago, now the New York Times is proposing a bailout to the media and Biden's talking about paying the corporate media.
[01:40:39.051 --> 01:40:39.612]  Paying them.
[01:40:40.698 --> 01:40:41.079]  Of course!
[01:40:41.079 --> 01:40:42.059]  Well guess what?
[01:40:42.059 --> 01:40:46.884]  Our government's so corrupt they just voted to suspend all elections until they decide COVID is over.
[01:40:46.884 --> 01:40:48.125]  Did you hear about that?
[01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.046]  I did!
[01:40:49.046 --> 01:40:49.947]  Tell us about that!
[01:40:49.947 --> 01:40:54.231]  Suspending elections, announcing martial law, saying Grinnell wants to be a dictator?
[01:40:55.433 --> 01:41:13.547]  He wants to be a dictator, he wants to infill a vaccine passport, he's suspended elections, he's putting checkpoints between provinces, he's having governments issue arrest warrants for people for things they haven't even done yet, and this is literally every dystopian movie and novel rolled into one and just thrown at our doorstep.
[01:41:13.547 --> 01:41:21.893]  I was in Vancouver and at a best shelter I saw an advertisement telling you that you're selfish if you have more than one child in Canada.
[01:41:23.732 --> 01:41:27.296]  This is the great reset New World Order depopulation operation.
[01:41:27.296 --> 01:41:39.389]  The New York Times wrote an article saying white women having a white boyfriend is racist and that they're terrorists and it's not a joke article and the new articles got written by all these white professors saying get rid of white people.
[01:41:39.389 --> 01:41:41.131]  I mean this is just, this is insane.
[01:41:42.159 --> 01:41:44.241]  It's beyond insane and it's not getting any better.
[01:41:44.241 --> 01:41:44.801]  Like, look at me.
[01:41:44.801 --> 01:41:56.611]  I'm in a truck right now doing the show with you because I was in a rally right before this and the police showed up to try to give me a hassle and we had to literally just take off, jump in a car, set up a hot spot and here we are.
[01:41:56.611 --> 01:41:57.852]  This is how I'm living right now.
[01:41:57.852 --> 01:41:59.033]  I live from place to place.
[01:41:59.033 --> 01:42:05.338]  You are literally an information warfare gorilla on the run like you are Paul Revere, brother.
[01:42:06.428 --> 01:42:07.489]  I can't even get home.
[01:42:07.489 --> 01:42:13.591]  I have to drive through Manitoba to get home and that's the province where I have a warrant for in my arrest for something that I never even did.
[01:42:13.591 --> 01:42:17.133]  I have a warrant for my arrest for going to a rally on Friday that I never went to.
[01:42:17.133 --> 01:42:19.634]  So hopefully they're smart enough to receive a warrant.
[01:42:19.634 --> 01:42:24.576]  Because they're saying assembly is illegal unless you're Walmart or unless you're an airport.
[01:42:24.576 --> 01:42:27.778]  I mean this is the total excuse for control and it's all over the Western world now.
[01:42:28.783 --> 01:42:33.848]  It's all over the Western world, and in Canada, a lot of people are actually asking for it.
[01:42:33.848 --> 01:42:38.151]  But before we go to the last commercial, I've got to say, the West Coast of Canada really did what I asked them to.
[01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:46.539]  I said that we needed to organize small businesses to open by May 24th, and when I went there on May 23rd, 2,000 businesses in British Columbia had signed on to the initiative.
[01:42:46.539 --> 01:42:47.539]  Hold on, we're doing another segment.
[01:42:47.539 --> 01:42:48.400]  Let's talk about action.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.441]  Don't hang up.
[01:42:49.441 --> 01:42:49.821]  Absolutely.
[01:42:49.821 --> 01:42:51.283]  Chris Sky, hold your horses.
[01:42:51.283 --> 01:42:51.803]  Literally.
[01:42:51.803 --> 01:42:52.544]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:52.544 --> 01:42:53.765]  We're going to talk about solutions.
[01:42:58.012 --> 01:43:03.713]  A lot of virtue-signalers out there will tell you how much they care about troops and how much they care about veterans.
[01:43:03.713 --> 01:43:10.795]  But at the same time, they won't stand up for what those veterans and what those troops fought for in the last 250 years of U.S.
[01:43:10.795 --> 01:43:11.775]  history.
[01:43:11.775 --> 01:43:16.376]  And now, more than ever, what our republic stands for and has stood for is under attack.
[01:43:16.376 --> 01:43:19.136]  America is under globalist takeover.
[01:43:19.136 --> 01:43:20.316]  It's an information war.
[01:43:20.316 --> 01:43:21.377]  It is an economic war.
[01:43:21.377 --> 01:43:23.217]  But most importantly, it is
[01:43:25.151 --> 01:43:30.321]  Now, of course, it's a biological and chemical war with the vaccines.
[01:43:30.321 --> 01:43:32.786]  We were the first to tell you that the virus came out of Wuhan.
[01:43:32.786 --> 01:43:35.511]  We were the first to tell you that vaccine passports were coming.
[01:43:35.511 --> 01:43:36.453]  We were the first to lay out
[01:43:37.193 --> 01:43:40.995]  Basically everything, because we actually do our research and know what we're talking about.
[01:43:40.995 --> 01:43:44.077]  And that's why it's important to keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[01:43:44.077 --> 01:43:48.519]  And for Memorial Day week, we're having store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:43:48.519 --> 01:43:52.741]  A lot of great products are back in stock, like DNA Force, Alpha Power, and Polyblock.
[01:43:52.741 --> 01:43:57.764]  So, to all the veterans and all the Patriots, we salute you, and I want to ask the listeners, please support InfoWars now more than ever.
[01:43:57.764 --> 01:44:05.468]  I don't really need to sell you on how beet concentrate is really good for your heart, good for your liver, good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular system and your brain.
[01:44:06.335 --> 01:44:10.656]  It's well known and so beet supplements are amongst the best sellers out there.
[01:44:10.656 --> 01:44:14.898]  So I went out to a top lab and I said, what is the strongest beet concentrate?
[01:44:14.898 --> 01:44:17.678]  You can do a copy of the popular formula you have.
[01:44:17.678 --> 01:44:25.921]  And they explained that their formula had a certain percentage and I said, just like the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, for the average competitors it's 5% curcuminoid.
[01:44:25.921 --> 01:44:27.141]  I said, no one else does 95?
[01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:28.441]  That's the highest level?
[01:44:28.441 --> 01:44:30.422]  I said, give me 95% curcuminoid!
[01:44:30.422 --> 01:44:32.243]  Didn't even cost much more!
[01:44:32.243 --> 01:44:32.903]  And we have 95% curcuminoid!
[01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:35.578]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:44:35.578 --> 01:44:45.907]  This is a very strong beet extract, and it's very good for your body, good for your heart, and it's back in stock, Basil Beets, at InfoWareStore.com, 50% off.
[01:44:45.907 --> 01:44:58.417]  Turbo Force is back in, DNA Force is back in, Ultra 12 is back in, Super Metal Vitality is back in, and they all fund the InfoWare, and they're store-wide free shipping, and double Patreon points for the week of Memorial Day.
[01:44:58.417 --> 01:44:59.558]  I always shoot you straight.
[01:45:00.126 --> 01:45:04.364]  And when I've told you over the years that if you don't support us, we'll be off the air, it's been true.
[01:45:05.129 --> 01:45:11.550]  But InfoWars has never been in a position where your support is more critical and more vital.
[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:13.731]  The enemy behind the scenes is doing so many things.
[01:45:13.731 --> 01:45:15.791]  I'm not going to take time up to whine about it.
[01:45:15.791 --> 01:45:16.591]  It's okay.
[01:45:16.591 --> 01:45:18.952]  I expect to be attacked because we're over the target.
[01:45:18.952 --> 01:45:21.012]  We're having a great effect.
[01:45:21.012 --> 01:45:22.173]  We're exposing evil.
[01:45:22.173 --> 01:45:23.393]  You're exposing evil.
[01:45:23.393 --> 01:45:32.075]  So when you spread the word about the broadcast, or when you buy products, or when you pray for InfoWars and our talk show hosts and our crew, it is so powerful.
[01:45:32.075 --> 01:45:32.535]  So again,
[01:45:33.195 --> 01:45:53.889]  As Memorial Day 2021 comes and goes, I want all of you to realize that I appreciate you as being veterans of the Info War, and I particularly thank our veterans as well that have served in the Armed Forces, because they understand what it is to sacrifice, and they're needed more now than ever to be leaders in our Republic to expose the globalism of foreign takeover that we're in the middle of right now.
[01:45:53.889 --> 01:45:55.350]  So it's a very historical time to be alive.
[01:45:55.350 --> 01:46:00.053]  I want to thank you all for your support, and ask you to support us again.
[01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.614]  What are champions made of?
[01:46:03.433 --> 01:46:04.557]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:46:10.913 --> 01:46:13.034]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:13.034 --> 01:46:15.376]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:15.376 --> 01:46:17.637]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:19.558]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:19.558 --> 01:46:21.159]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:21.159 --> 01:46:22.400]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.061]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:46:37.368 --> 01:46:40.831]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[01:46:40.831 --> 01:46:43.292]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[01:46:43.292 --> 01:46:45.234]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[01:46:45.234 --> 01:46:45.454]  888-233-139, 888-233-139, 888-233-139.
[01:46:45.454 --> 01:46:46.655]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:46.655 --> 01:46:48.616]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.925 --> 01:47:23.186]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:23.186 --> 01:47:24.027]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[01:47:24.027 --> 01:47:31.331]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:31.331 --> 01:47:37.315]  Final segment ahead of two hours of more live Radio Slash TV with Owen Schroer and Sunday Live.
[01:47:37.315 --> 01:47:38.916]  Which we've cut the ads in half for that.
[01:47:38.916 --> 01:47:40.497]  We only have local ads for local stations.
[01:47:40.497 --> 01:47:42.258]  We've cut our network ads on that show.
[01:47:42.258 --> 01:47:43.739]  A lot of stations are picking it up.
[01:47:45.405 --> 01:47:47.986]  Again, Chris Guy is a modern Paul Revere.
[01:47:47.986 --> 01:47:49.046]  I follow what he does.
[01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.207]  He has been arrested, harassed.
[01:47:51.207 --> 01:47:57.049]  They have been after him because he's eloquent, he's well-spoken, he predicted it all, he is a leader.
[01:47:57.049 --> 01:47:58.650]  And he's getting other leaders to take action.
[01:47:58.650 --> 01:47:59.950]  They tried to stop him.
[01:47:59.950 --> 01:48:02.191]  He had the helicopter into his last place.
[01:48:02.191 --> 01:48:04.872]  He had to change clothes three times when trying to arrest him.
[01:48:04.872 --> 01:48:07.593]  They've got warrants out for him all over for speaking.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:11.521]  And they're arresting preachers all over the once-free country of Canada.
[01:48:11.521 --> 01:48:16.863]  I mean, we live basically next door to North Korea, but everyone's behaving so nicely under it.
[01:48:16.863 --> 01:48:20.124]  Chris Sky, I'm really worried about Canada.
[01:48:20.124 --> 01:48:25.406]  At least there was a lot of anger at Ford when he announced official martial law.
[01:48:25.406 --> 01:48:28.747]  We already played Trudeau laughing about buying off the media.
[01:48:28.747 --> 01:48:35.350]  Here is your leader, Trudeau, talking about dictatorship and admiring Xi Jinping.
[01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.690]  Here it is.
[01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:44.024]  Trudeau's meeting last week with a group of Toronto women was an example.
[01:48:44.024 --> 01:48:51.149]  Even with Sun TV watching for any slip, he was asked which country he most admired and referred to China.
[01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:55.292]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[01:48:57.448 --> 01:49:09.073]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[01:49:09.073 --> 01:49:10.974]  Shut it off.
[01:49:10.974 --> 01:49:11.874]  China doesn't do any of that.
[01:49:11.874 --> 01:49:13.215]  They're the dirtiest or the worst.
[01:49:13.215 --> 01:49:14.896]  We do all that and we can't operate.
[01:49:15.476 --> 01:49:17.437]  And what did Biden just say?
[01:49:17.437 --> 01:49:20.339]  Oh, China's going to take over because they're a dictatorship.
[01:49:20.339 --> 01:49:21.560]  You got to do what I say.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.481]  We got to be able to make decisions quick.
[01:49:23.481 --> 01:49:26.663]  You notice all the women were winking at each other, getting excited.
[01:49:26.663 --> 01:49:29.144]  They've signed on to dictatorship.
[01:49:29.144 --> 01:49:32.186]  The left does what they're told, when they told.
[01:49:32.186 --> 01:49:33.387]  There's two papers in Austin.
[01:49:34.744 --> 01:49:37.985]  Every magazine I saw said, what to do once we reopen?
[01:49:37.985 --> 01:49:40.226]  And it was on every magazine cover in our country.
[01:49:40.226 --> 01:49:42.366]  It's centralized control, folks.
[01:49:42.366 --> 01:49:43.546]  It's dangerous.
[01:49:43.546 --> 01:49:44.267]  It's evil.
[01:49:44.267 --> 01:49:45.007]  It's bad.
[01:49:45.007 --> 01:49:51.228]  And it's saying you're not essential if you're not a corporate operative and you're going to live in a compact coffin apartment.
[01:49:51.228 --> 01:49:52.889]  This isn't coming, Chris Sky.
[01:49:52.889 --> 01:49:53.549]  It's here, brother.
[01:49:55.283 --> 01:49:55.323]  100%.
[01:49:55.323 --> 01:49:56.964]  The lawlessness is crazy.
[01:49:56.964 --> 01:50:11.538]  And speaking of Doug Ford, I have to be careful what I say because I don't know if you saw but I was front page news all over Canada on all the mainstream media because apparently I made death threats against him and all the other premiers and then I apparently tried to assault a police officer and all that other bullshit.
[01:50:11.918 --> 01:50:14.639]  All false allegations that were started by a man.
[01:50:14.639 --> 01:50:16.860]  I just got to address this so everybody understands.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:21.441]  A man by the name of Rob Carbone who fancies himself the leader of the Republican Party of Canada.
[01:50:21.441 --> 01:50:24.202]  Representing himself like a Canadian Donald Trump.
[01:50:24.202 --> 01:50:27.043]  In reality, he's a con, a fraud, a liar.
[01:50:27.043 --> 01:50:30.164]  And I had evidence that he was committing fraud and stealing money.
[01:50:30.164 --> 01:50:33.645]  And I had irrefutable evidence and witnesses that I was about to go public with.
[01:50:34.065 --> 01:50:43.311]  And that's why he called the police and the only evidence they have of these so-called alleged threats I made was this man calling and saying that he had a conversation with me and I said it.
[01:50:43.311 --> 01:50:46.213]  Everybody who knows me knows that I'm not like that.
[01:50:46.213 --> 01:50:50.215]  So these are more false allegations that just gave them more fuel for the fire.
[01:50:50.215 --> 01:50:55.658]  To the point, like you said, now when I go to a rally, I see the police watching me, taking pictures of me.
[01:50:55.658 --> 01:51:02.923]  At the end of the rallies I have to swap clothes and walk away with groups of people just so I don't get grabbed, illegally detained for whatever reason.
[01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:11.865]  They will look at any excuse to detain me and arrest me, and then they will try to not give me bail, because their agenda is to try to lock me up, throw away the key, and shut me up.
[01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:16.005]  But all they're doing is turning you into a faux hero, and we got caught up on the break.
[01:51:16.005 --> 01:51:17.326]  You are the resistance.
[01:51:17.326 --> 01:51:18.726]  We are the resistance.
[01:51:18.726 --> 01:51:19.986]  All over the world, the resistance.
[01:51:19.986 --> 01:51:27.708]  Explain what you did, what locals did, and why some areas are being forced to reopen because the public is no longer submitting to the year-plus martial law.
[01:51:27.708 --> 01:51:29.408]  Let's talk about solutions and why they're after you.
[01:51:30.208 --> 01:51:30.648]  Perfect!
[01:51:30.648 --> 01:51:34.289]  It was part of my Taking Action Tour, which was Phase 2 of United Non-Compliance.
[01:51:34.289 --> 01:51:47.533]  Phase 1 was the Global Awakening, when people like me and others went around and told the truth, and we elevated the human consciousness and changed the perception to let everybody know that everything that's happening right now is not about our safety and health, but it's about control and dominance.
[01:51:47.973 --> 01:51:51.974]  And so phase two of United Non-Compliance in 2021, we called Taking Action.
[01:51:51.974 --> 01:51:59.177]  And to take action, we started breaking down our protest groups into smaller groups that could take individual actions on the ground level that will make a difference.
[01:51:59.177 --> 01:52:02.078]  And the number one group we created were the small business owners.
[01:52:02.078 --> 01:52:05.179]  And British Columbia, the west coast of Canada, took this very seriously.
[01:52:05.179 --> 01:52:10.901]  And by the time I got back there on the 23rd, and our opening date that we all declared was the 24th,
[01:52:11.761 --> 01:52:17.165]  Over 2,000 businesses had signed on a declaration that they were going to open whether the government liked it or not.
[01:52:17.165 --> 01:52:18.145]  And guess what?
[01:52:18.145 --> 01:52:24.830]  May 25th, by coincidence, I'm sure, the government removed a lot of restrictions.
[01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:26.631]  They had, like, a dine-in route.
[01:52:26.631 --> 01:52:27.712]  They had dine-in.
[01:52:27.712 --> 01:52:29.653]  They had all kinds of things opening up.
[01:52:29.653 --> 01:52:32.215]  They had all kinds of capacity limits removed.
[01:52:32.215 --> 01:52:35.057]  And it's because the people took action.
[01:52:35.057 --> 01:52:40.200]  If there was only 20 businesses that signed on, the government wouldn't have done anything except extend the lockdown.
[01:52:41.681 --> 01:52:43.823]  They would have selectively targeted those.
[01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:47.765]  When the churches of Canada see 50 churches closed, they should all open.
[01:52:47.765 --> 01:52:49.106]  They should have never closed!
[01:52:49.106 --> 01:52:55.130]  The government's saying, your religion is not essential, so everything's open but your churches and your small businesses.
[01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:56.471]  This is so predatory!
[01:52:56.471 --> 01:52:57.672]  This is so obvious!
[01:52:57.672 --> 01:52:58.853]  This is so ridiculous!
[01:52:59.813 --> 01:53:01.734]  They're not even hiding their intentions anymore.
[01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:03.774]  It's full fettered dominance.
[01:53:03.774 --> 01:53:06.035]  Full fettered, you will comply or else.
[01:53:06.035 --> 01:53:10.316]  And that's why they're breaking every single law, violating every protection.
[01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:18.679]  They even made it now... Wow, you guys in the States, your Red Cross will not allow blood donations from people who have been given the COVID vaccine.
[01:53:18.679 --> 01:53:20.260]  For good reason!
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:24.561]  In Canada, Canadian blood services will not only allow it, they're just fine with it.
[01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:26.646]  This is like a double standard.
[01:53:26.646 --> 01:53:32.849]  When you guys banned the AstraZeneca vaccine, Trudeau was trying to buy it from you guys at a discount so he could still inject Canadian vaccines.
[01:53:32.849 --> 01:53:36.131]  And let's remind people, a lot of these vaccines are banned in major countries.
[01:53:36.131 --> 01:53:38.793]  We never hear that because the media is so damn controlled.
[01:53:38.793 --> 01:53:41.995]  And then you, or medical doctors or scientists, they get censored.
[01:53:41.995 --> 01:53:50.960]  You know that Facebook thing about how medical doctors and Senate hearings and hearings in Texas and Florida were banned under Facebook orders.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.261]  That's doctors in legislative hearings!
[01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:57.582]  Big Tech saying we can't hear that.
[01:53:57.582 --> 01:54:01.923]  They're banning members of the Australian Parliament that criticize it off Facebook.
[01:54:01.923 --> 01:54:03.384]  This is a power grab.
[01:54:03.384 --> 01:54:04.904]  Facebook is heavily invested.
[01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:06.925]  So is Google in Big Pharma.
[01:54:06.925 --> 01:54:09.426]  And I mean, Congress must act.
[01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:13.047]  I'm telling you though, I typed in Trudeau dictatorship.
[01:54:13.047 --> 01:54:15.608]  I didn't know that even the Huffington Post said
[01:54:16.368 --> 01:54:20.009]  That there was a plan for him to basically become a dictator and he wants to be a dictator.
[01:54:20.009 --> 01:54:23.970]  So I guess this is an actual plan of the Labour Party up there.
[01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:25.750]  Well it is, he is a dictator.
[01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:26.931]  Like, they're all dictators.
[01:54:26.931 --> 01:54:32.392]  Doug Ford, like you said, he put in that plan that was basically martial law but with the government still in control.
[01:54:32.392 --> 01:54:35.113]  He wanted us, we're still under a stay-at-home order in Ontario.
[01:54:35.113 --> 01:54:40.854]  We're not supposed to leave our houses for any reason except medical or essential until June 16th.
[01:54:40.854 --> 01:54:42.775]  And that's been since friggin' November.
[01:54:43.235 --> 01:54:55.564]  Then they made the checkpoints inter-provincial, and they announced that they were going to make checkpoints within different regions of the province, and give police power to pull over any vehicle, and ask them where they were going.
[01:54:55.564 --> 01:54:58.867]  And it was the police that said no, finally.
[01:54:58.867 --> 01:55:02.229]  And it was the police that finally said no, so he came out and apologized.
[01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.789]  It's incredible.
[01:55:04.042 --> 01:55:05.163]  Let's hit this.
[01:55:05.163 --> 01:55:10.768]  Explain to listeners, though, whether all over the U.S., they need to know, this is coming back.
[01:55:10.768 --> 01:55:11.629]  This is a U.N.
[01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:12.570]  directive.
[01:55:12.570 --> 01:55:16.293]  So people have to realize what's happening to Canada is a beta test for us.
[01:55:16.293 --> 01:55:19.055]  We are all going to be Canadians very, very soon.
[01:55:19.055 --> 01:55:23.099]  How do you see them rolling it back out in the West as they promised to do?
[01:55:23.999 --> 01:55:25.440]  You guys have no idea what's coming.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:28.941]  If you know what this year is, this is the 50th year for the U.S.
[01:55:28.941 --> 01:55:29.821]  currency.
[01:55:29.821 --> 01:55:33.323]  No fiat currency has ever lasted longer than 50 years.
[01:55:33.323 --> 01:55:36.524]  They're actually running bets in Vegas right now on which month the U.S.
[01:55:36.524 --> 01:55:38.885]  dollar is going to collapse.
[01:55:38.885 --> 01:55:43.807]  And all this COVID and all this stuff and all this part of the Great Reset is a part of the dollar collapse.
[01:55:43.807 --> 01:55:46.228]  You're going to see a huge devaluation of the U.S.
[01:55:46.228 --> 01:55:48.209]  dollar sometime around the middle of summer.
[01:55:48.209 --> 01:55:49.950]  You're going to see supply chain disruptions.
[01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:53.011]  You're going to see all the same type of stuff that's happening here in the States.
[01:55:53.291 --> 01:55:58.992]  I've already applied for a waiver to make sure I have no problems going to the States, because I know I'm going to have to take this tour over there.
[01:55:58.992 --> 01:56:01.713]  And I know that this is a problem that can't be fixed by just one country.
[01:56:01.713 --> 01:56:06.254]  And by the way, China just announced they're worried a bubble's about to break and that the dollars are dying.
[01:56:06.254 --> 01:56:07.614]  You show your sophistication.
[01:56:07.614 --> 01:56:11.215]  It was back in 1963 that they re-monetized the U.S.
[01:56:11.215 --> 01:56:11.395]  debt.
[01:56:11.395 --> 01:56:12.275]  They did it previously.
[01:56:12.275 --> 01:56:13.215]  So we've had the U.S.
[01:56:13.215 --> 01:56:16.576]  dollar for 200 plus years, but it's always being re-monetized and changed.
[01:56:16.576 --> 01:56:17.276]  And you're right.
[01:56:17.276 --> 01:56:20.857]  They're moving for a new Bretton Woods and a new global currency right now.
[01:56:21.237 --> 01:56:29.863]  And they need COVID collapses to cover for what they call a global Marshall Plan, where the central banks put us all into deeper debt, but make us sign our rights over.
[01:56:29.863 --> 01:56:33.906]  And Klaus Schwab says we'll all have a global ID and implantable microchip on French TV.
[01:56:35.410 --> 01:56:36.610]  That's pretty much what they want to do.
[01:56:36.610 --> 01:56:44.012]  They want to use debt to create a situation of a crisis, where then they can then use a world currency, which will most likely be a digital currency.
[01:56:44.012 --> 01:56:54.455]  And it's just like what we said, it's when we talk about a one world government takeover, we're not talking about one supernatural government with one world leader that's going to take over the entire world.
[01:56:54.455 --> 01:57:01.137]  No, we're still going to have our own countries, our own governments, their own leaders, but they're going to follow a universal directive like we've seen with COVID.
[01:57:01.137 --> 01:57:04.198]  And they're going to follow that universal directive with all the laws when it comes to
[01:57:04.438 --> 01:57:05.880]  And Chris, they admit that's the plan.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:12.710]  You're going to be giving us daily updates on the War Room, on the Alex Jones Show, and on American Journal's 8 a.m.
[01:57:12.710 --> 01:57:13.111]  weekdays.
[01:57:13.111 --> 01:57:15.995]  You're going to be popping in each day to give folks updates.
[01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:19.059]  From Paul Revere of North America, Chris Sky, we salute you.
[01:57:19.059 --> 01:57:19.360]  Thank you.
[01:57:20.194 --> 01:57:20.554]  Thank you.
[01:57:20.554 --> 01:57:22.975]  Yes, I'll be literally in on the run.
[01:57:22.975 --> 01:57:23.955]  Literally on the run.
[01:57:23.955 --> 01:57:25.895]  I'll be jumping in and updating you guys.
[01:57:25.895 --> 01:57:30.697]  To get my book right now, go to www.RealChrisSky.com.
[01:57:30.697 --> 01:57:32.157]  It's called Just Say No.
[01:57:32.157 --> 01:57:33.497]  We're shipping them out right away.
[01:57:33.497 --> 01:57:34.198]  Beautiful, Chris.
[01:57:34.198 --> 01:57:35.618]  We're going to talk to you on Tuesday.
[01:57:35.618 --> 01:57:37.138]  Be safe, brother.
[01:57:37.138 --> 01:57:37.699]  Wow.
[01:57:37.699 --> 01:57:38.039]  All right.
[01:57:38.039 --> 01:57:39.599]  Owen Schroer is about to take over.
[01:57:39.599 --> 01:57:41.079]  Speak of funding.
[01:57:41.079 --> 01:57:42.800]  Free shipping store-wide from Memorial Day.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.720]  Double pay, three points.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:44.780]  Biggest sale of the year.
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:45.441]  InfoWare store.
[01:57:45.441 --> 01:57:46.861]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:57:46.861 --> 01:57:47.121]  Thank you.
[01:57:48.214 --> 01:57:55.457]  I've been on air 27 years, and we've gone through a lot of criticism, a lot of attacks, but also a lot of amazing support.
[01:57:55.457 --> 01:58:06.902]  And so that's why I always take time out to thank you for keeping us on air, because without you, without the crew, without our sponsors, without our affiliates, without everybody, we would not be on air, and the world would be a different place.
[01:58:06.902 --> 01:58:10.603]  So it's not a power trip when I realize the great effect we've had.
[01:58:10.603 --> 01:58:16.966]  It's really counting the cost and realizing that if we weren't here, if you hadn't have supported us,
[01:58:17.746 --> 01:58:21.388]  The whole planet would be in a much worse position with the globalists.
[01:58:21.388 --> 01:58:24.169]  Instead, a lot of really, really positive things are happening.
[01:58:24.169 --> 01:58:28.750]  And so many of the corrupt things the globalists have been involved in are now coming out in the open.
[01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:31.892]  And so InfoWars credibility is higher than it's ever been.
[01:58:31.892 --> 01:58:34.913]  But the enemy is trying to shut us down with so many different attacks.
[01:58:35.393 --> 01:58:37.274]  We've had to build our own infrastructure to stay on air.
[01:58:37.274 --> 01:58:38.495]  It's so expensive.
[01:58:38.495 --> 01:58:43.797]  So please, get great products and keep InfoWars on the air at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:43.797 --> 01:58:48.519]  In fact, for the week of Memorial Day, we have shoreline free shipping and double Patreon points.
[01:58:48.519 --> 01:58:53.001]  I share with you, the viewers and listeners, the facts of where InfoWars is.
[01:58:53.001 --> 01:58:59.044]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that make all this possible.
[01:58:59.671 --> 01:59:09.907]  So in short, the world's awakening, despite all the censorship, InfoWars has never been more influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the globalist agenda and fighting it.
[01:59:09.907 --> 01:59:10.608]  But that said...
[01:59:11.405 --> 01:59:15.348]  The COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains, has almost shut us down.
[01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:21.392]  Because most of the best-selling products, which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others, have been sold out for up to seven months.
[01:59:21.392 --> 01:59:22.413]  Well, guess what?
[01:59:22.413 --> 01:59:26.055]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[01:59:26.055 --> 01:59:28.997]  It's 40% off, it's amazing, at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:59:28.997 --> 01:59:34.861]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points.
[01:59:34.861 --> 01:59:36.262]  And Alpha Power's back in stock.
[01:59:36.742 --> 01:59:38.144]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
